Abstract 

Nanographitic structures (NGSs) with multitude of morphological features are grown on SiO2/Si 

substrates by electron cyclotron resonance - plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ECR-

PECVD). CH4 is used as source gas with Ar and H2 as dilutants. Field emission scanning electron 

microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy 

are  used  to  study  the  structural  and  morphological  features  of  the  grown  films.  Herein,  we 

demonstrate,  how  the  morphology  can  be  tuned  from  planar  to  vertical  structure  using  single 

control parameter namely, dilution of CH4 with Ar and/or H2. Our results show that the competitive 

growth and etching processes dictate the morphology of the NGSs. While Ar-rich composition 

favors vertically oriented graphene nanosheets, H2-rich composition aids growth of planar films. 

Raman analysis reveals dilution of CH4 with either Ar or H2 or in combination helps to improve 

the structural quality of the films. Line shape analysis of Raman 2D band shows nearly symmetric 

Lorentzian profile which confirms the turbostratic nature of the grown NGSs. Further, this aspect 

is  elucidated  by  HRTEM  studies  by  observing    elliptical  diffraction  pattern.    Based  on  these 

experiments, a comprehensive understanding is obtained on the growth and structural properties 

of  NGSs grown over a wide range of feedstock compositions.

Introduction 

The  carbon  nanostructures  such  as  fullerenes,  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs),  graphene  and 

nanodiamonds have drawn a significant attention in scientific and industrial research due to their 

unique structural, electrical, optical and mechanical properties.1-4 Recently, a considerable interest 

is shown to grow large area vertical graphene nanosheets (VGNs), also called as carbon nanowalls 

(CNWs),  and  a  few  layer  planar  nanographite  (FPNG)  structures  because  of  their  potential 

applications in various fields.2-5 The VGNs have unique structural  and electrical characteristics 

with  high  aspect  ratio  and  large  three  dimensional  networks  which  make  them  an  excellent 

candidate for field emission, fuel cells, chemical & biosensors and energy storage devices.2-6 The 

FPNG films can also be used for transparent conductive films and flexible electronics.5  

Among  a  variety  of  growth  processes  of  nanographite  structures  (NGSs),  the  plasma 

enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) holds the promise to grow large area, conformal 

and uniform NGSs in a controlled manner with numerous advantages. Also, it is important to note 

that the synthesis is catalyst free and it is possible to grow on any type of substrates such as metals, 

semiconductors  or  insulators.  Thus,  the  PECVD  growth  helps  to  avoid  a  major  hurdle  of 

transferring the graphene onto a dielectric substrate for device fabrication. The growth parameters 

such as feedstock gases and their composition, microwave power, electric field, temperature and 

pressure have strong influence on the morphology,  growth  rate  and structural  properties of the 

NGSs.7-9 In order to realize and enhance the full potential of this material, it is necessary to have 

a  clear  understanding  and  fine  control  of  their  structural  and  physical  properties  by  tuning  the 

growth conditions. 

Although a number of reports have appeared in literature on this subject describing the role 

of  different  gas  compositions  on  the  growth  of  NGSs  using  a  variety  of  growth  techniques,  a 

systematic study using a single growth technique is  scarce.10-12 Further, the observed results in 

terms of morphology and structural properties of NGSs grown by various groups are only in partial 

agreement, and sometimes even contradictory.3, 5-27 The reason for such variation and discrepancy 

among the published results could be due to different synthesis techniques and conditions, which 

make  it  difficult  to  give  a  unique  interpretation  for  the  growth  and  its  properties.  Hence,  a 

systematic  study  on  growth  of  NGSs  under  different  gas  compositions  using  a  single  growth 

technique is highly desirable. Also, this could possibly explain the structure-property relationship

of NGSs which is essential for using them in applications. A brief survey on the existing reports 

on the growth of VGNs and FPNG films in this context as follows: 

In 2002, Wu et al.13 incidentally observed the growth of vertically oriented well separated 

graphene sheets, called as CNWs, while synthesizing CNTs by microwave PECVD using metallic 

catalysts. Since then, several groups have explored the growth of VGNs on catalytic as well as 

non-catalytic metal / dielectric surfaces using various plasma based techniques such as microwave 

PECVD, dc plasma discharge,  ICP-plasma  and thermal  plasma jet systems.10-27  In an excellent 

review, Bo et al.11 summarized the influence of various key process parameters on the synthesis 

and growth model for NGSs on various types of substrates. In spite of several existing reports, 

herein  we  note  that,  still  there  is  no  unique  theory  that  could  unveil  the  atomistic  growth 

mechanism and give a prescription to optimize the process parameters for a given plasma source.11 

In short, while some of the groups have used Ar for the dilution of hydrocarbon,23-25 the others 

employed H2 to grow VGNs.7-10, 13, 26 A few groups had also used combination of Ar and H2 for 

the growth of VGNs.20, 21  

The growth of monolayer graphene or FPNG films on metal surfaces using PECVD have 

been successfully demonstrated by a few groups.5, 14-18 A single layer graphene on Cu or Ni are 

grown using CH4/H2 or CH4/Ar by microwave PECVD.14, 16, 17 A high quality single layer graphene 

on copper substrate is grown by ICP-CVD using feedstock gases of CH4:Ar:H2 in 1:90:10 ratio.18  

Invariably all the above groups have used either H2 and/or Ar as the gas for dilution to grow planar 

structures.  

In addition to growth of NGSs, Cho et al.19 had controlled the density of CNWs deposited 

using CH4/H2 at 2:1 ratio by varying total pressure and discharge power during growth in radical 

injection PECVD. Apart from single carrier gas, by varying the composition of two different types 

of dilution gases like Ar and H2, the possibility to grow tree-like or petal-like structures is also 

reported.20 Ubnoske et al.22 could change the morphology of carbon nanostructures from CNTs to 

vertically  oriented  graphene  nanosheets  with  intermediate  graphenated  CNTs  by  tuning  the 

substrate temperature from 800 to 1100 0C in microwave PECVD with CH4:NH3 flow in ratio of 

3:1 sccm. Thus, only a limited study has been carried out on the nature of tunable morphology and 

their structural properties.

In  this  work,  we  report  a  systematic  study  on  the  synthesis  of  NGSs  with  tunable 

morphology using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) - PECVD. We also try to address a number 

of issues relating to the effect of dilution gases, Ar and H2, on the growth and structural properties 

of NGSs deposited on dielectric SiO2/Si substrates. Morphology is tuned from vertical to planar 

NGSs by the appropriate choice of carrier  gas composition.  A plausible growth  mechanism on 

different  morphological  features  is  discussed.  The  structural  properties  of  the  grown  films  are 

analyzed  in  the  light  of  Raman  spectroscopy.  It  is  found  that  the  data  obtained  are  in  good 

agreement with morphology obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  

Experimental 

Growth of NGSs by ECR-PECVD  

The synthesis of NGSs on SiO2/Si substrates is performed under different feedstock gas 

compositions using ECR-PECVD. The details of the deposition system is reported elsewhere.23 

For the present study, we choose CH4 (5N purity) as hydrocarbon source. The Ar (3N purity) and 

H2 (5N purity) are used as dilution gases. Thermally oxidized SiO2 substrates of thickness about 

300 nm are kept at 5 and 40 cms below the gas shower head and quartz window, respectively. Prior 

to growth, the chamber is evacuated down to a base pressure of 5Ã—10-6 mbar by a turbomolecular 

pump and then the substrate temperature is increased to 800oC at a rate of 30oC/min and maintained 

for 30 min. Subsequently, the substrates are pre-cleaned by Ar plasma with 20 sccm flow for 10 

min at 200W power. After cleaning, CH4 is fed into the chamber through downstream gas shower 

ring along with the dilution gas(es) H2 or Ar or H2-Ar combination. For all growth experiments, 

the  microwave  power  is  kept  constant  at  400  W.  After  the  growth  of  NGSs  (30  minutes),  the 

plasma is turned off and the samples are allowed to remain at growth temperature for another 30 

minutes. Samples are then cooled to room temperature by switching OFF the heater.  

The  samples  are  investigated  for  their  morphological  and  structural  features  by  SEM, 

atomic force microscope (AFM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, 

LIBRA  200FE,  Zeiss).  HRTEM  samples  are  prepared  by  scratching  VGNs  grown  on  SiO2 

substrates by  Cu grids coated with lacey carbon. The degree of graphitization, in terms of defects 

and disorder, are evaluated by micro-Raman spectroscopy (inVia Renishaw) in the back scattering 

geometry. The spectrometer is equipped with Ar+ laser (514 nm) as the probe source with grating 

monochromator  (1800  grooves/mm)  and  Peltier  cooled  charged  couple  device  as  detector.  A

microscope objective of 100X magnification with numerical aperture of 0.8 is used in this study. 

In order to avoid the laser induced heating on samples, laser power is kept below 1 mW. Raman 

spectra are analyzed using WIRE3.2 software and fitted with Lorentzian function. 

Results 

The  growth  experiments  were  carried  out  at  various  input  gas  compositions  having 

different CH4:Ar:H2 ratios while the other parameters like growth time, temperature, microwave 

power  and  post-annealing  time  are  kept  constant.  To  make  the  analysis  simple,  we  divide  our 

experimental results into three cases according to the type of dilution viz (i) dilution of CH4 with 

Ar (case 1), (ii) dilution of CH4 with H2 (case 2) and  (iii) dilution of CH4 with a mixture of Ar and 

H2 (case 3). In order to study the effect of dilution, we retain the hydrocarbon content to be constant 

in  all  the  growth  experiments  except  for  case  3.  Hence,  the  total  pressure  in  the  chamber  is 

maintained between 1.7 x 10-3 and 5.5 x 10-3 mbar for the total flow rate which changes from 5 to 

40 sccm. All the samples are labeled in accordance with this gas ratios in the order CH4:Ar:H2 

unless or otherwise mentioned specifically. 

SEM Analysis  

Case 1: Dilution of CH4 with Ar   

Fig. 1 shows the surface morphology of the NGSs grown with CH4 diluted with Ar in the 

ratio of CH4:Ar upto 1:7. It can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that mere decomposition of CH4 alone can 

produce a homogeneous film consisting of many island like structures over the smooth substrate. 

Subsequently  when  Ar  is  introduced  into  CH4,  the  nanoisland  structures  get  transformed  into 

vertically oriented structure as shown in Fig. 1(b). Further increase in Ar, increases the height of 

the VGNs and decreases the number density of the sheets. However, the width and length of the 

vertical sheets increase with Ar dilution as shown in Fig. 1(a-e). In addition, substantial increase 

in height from 27.8 to 164.9 nm is observed when the Ar flow is increased from 5 to 35 sccm (see 

Fig. 1(f)). The in-built electric field associated with plasma is found to assist vertical growth.13 

Further, the plasma can produce a relatively higher temperature and chemical potential gradients 

near  the  substrate  surface  which  can  also  enhance  the  vertical  growth.28  The  dilution  of 

hydrocarbon with Ar is known to enhance the formation of C2 radicals which helps to grow high

progresses,  the  atomic  hydrogen  (  H* )    generated  from  the  dissociation  of  CH4  by  microwave 

energy  also start etching the growing film. The concurrent growth and etching processes make the 

VGNs to gain height and decrease the number density.  

Case 2: Dilution of CH4 with H2    

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of the NGSs grown with CH4 diluted with H2 in the 

ratio of CH4:H2 upto 1:7..The SEM images show no specific features and the surface appears to 

be smooth. However, we perform AFM measurements to have a closer look and access the fine 

features of the surface and shown in Fig. 3. When H2 is introduced into CH4, i.e. 1:1 and 1:3 ratios 

of CH4: H2, the nanoisland structure (see Fig. 2(a)) turned out to be a smooth planar structure (see 

Fig. 2(b) and (c)). Further increase in H2 flow leads to the formation of nanoisland structure over 

electrically continuous NGSs, and a discontinuous film for flow rates of CH4:H2 at 1:5 and 1:7

ratios, respectively. Thus, with increase in H2 content, discontinuity in the films is observed with 

isolated clusters, and the growth of the film is hindered as shown in Fig. 2(a-d). 

H2 plays an important role in decomposition kinetics of CH4 under microwave plasma. C2 

and H* radical density can be effectively controlled by H2 content in the feedstock gases. Further, 

the H* radicals efficiently etch out amorphous carbon     (a-C). It also etches out weakly bonded 

carbon atoms and small graphitic fragments to prevent formation of additional graphene layers. 

Further, it enables the mobility of carbon adatoms to efficiently reduce the structural disorder.6 

Fig. 3 shows the topographic images obtained from AFM. These images clearly show the variation 

on the surface features due to etching of H* radicals. The rms roughness measured over an area of 

500 x 500 nm2 is found to be 0.65, 1.28, 1.57 and 0.82 nm for the films grown at 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 and 

1:7 ratios, respectively. The increase in rms roughness values with H2 dilution indicates that the 

H* radicals etch out the  growing carbon films. At 1:7 dilution ratio, the majority of the carbon 

films are etched out and only isolated carbon clusters are left out. The thickness of the films is also 

measured using AFM over a surface scratched by a soft toothpick and the values are given in Table 

1. In addition, the ECR plasma produces higher density of H* radicals in comparison to other types 

of plasma sources. This excess H* radicals lead to chemical etching of growing film. Thus, the 

vertical growth is hampered by excess hydrogen radicals in ECR- PECVD under hydrogen-rich 

dilution.  

Case 3: Dilution of CH4 with a gas mixture of Ar + H2 

As discussed in previous sections (case 1 & 2), the dilution of CH4 with Ar or H2 favors 

VGNs and FPNG films, respectively. Taking cue from these experiments, a combination of these 

two dilution gases with CH4 is explored to study their impact on the morphology, growth rate and 

structural properties. These experiments are performed under three subcategories viz (i) repetition 

of case 1 experiments with addition of constant H2 (case 3(a)) (ii) repetition of case 2 experiments 

with addition of constant Ar (case 3(b)) and (iii) increasing CH4 concentration with fixed Ar and 

H2 ratios (case 3(c)).

Fig. 4 SEM micrographs of nanographite structures grown under mixed Ar+H 2 dilution. The actual gas flow 
ratios are labeled on each image as CH4:Ar:H2. The inset in Fig (b), (c), (e), (f) and (h) is cross-sectional SEM 
image of respective film with 200 nm scale bar. 

Fig.  4  shows  the  SEM  micrographs  for  the  films  grown  by  dilution  of  CH4  with  a  gas 

mixture of Ar with addition of constant H2 at various concentrations. While repeating the case 1 

and case 2 experiments with mixture of constant H2 and Ar, respectively, the morphology of the 

NGSs  is  found  to  change  considerably.  It  is  evidenced  from  these  SEM  micrographs  that  the 

morphology can be tuned from perfect planar to highly dense vertical structures with intermediate 

sparsely  distributed  vertical  structures  which  can  be  seen  from  in  Fig.  4.  In  case  3(c),  the 

concentration of CH4 alone is increased while maintaining the amounts of Ar and H2      (1:3:1, 

3:3:1 and 5:3:1 ratios) constant. The SEM morphology of these films are shown in Fig. 4(b,e,h). 

As shown in these images, the vertical structure systematically transforms into planar structure 

with  increasing  CH4  concentration.  The  reason  for  the  flipping  of  orientation  is  due  to  the 

abundance of nascent hydrogen that gets released from fragmenting CH4 in the plasma. Briefly, 

 
                
 
 
 
This manuscript got published in RSC Adv., 2015,5, 91922-91931

we observe that the morphology of NGSs is mostly dependant on the nature of dominant dilutant 

gas. Hence, it is very clear that the surface morphology and aerial density of the nanosheets can be 

completely controlled using optimal dilution ratios of Ar and H2 in CH4. 

HRTEM analysis 

Fig. 5 (a,b) and (d,e) represent the HRTEM images of the films grown under the flow ratio 

of 1:7:0 and 1:0:5 respectively. HRTEM analysis clearly confirms that NGSs are composed  of 

about 13 number of graphene layers as shown in Fig 5(a) and 5(b). The graphene sheets are by and 

large  uniform  in  nature.  However,  the  edges  of  VGNs  are  found  to  be  tapered  (Fig.  5a).  The 

measured inter layer spacing of the respective samples are found to be 0.356 and 0.364 nm, which 

is higher than that of graphite (0.334 nm). The increased interlayer spacing could be correlated to 

the  stacking  fault  disorder  called  turbostratic  graphite.29    Fig  5c  and  5f  show  the  Fast  Fourier 

transform (FFT) images that are corresponding to the HRTEM images of Fig. 5(b) and Fig.5(e) 

respectively.  Both  the FFT images  show  the spots in  elliptical  pattern  which is  a characteristic 

feature of turbostratic graphite. The enhanced growth kinetics under non-equillibrium conditions 

in the plasma leads to the turbostratic disorder. 

Fig. 5(a,b) and 5(d,e) are the HRTEM images  of the samples grown under feedstock composition of 1:7:0 and 
1:0:5 respectively. Fig 5c and 5f are fast Fourier transform images corresponding to image (b) and (e) 
respectively.

Raman spectroscopy 

Raman  spectroscopy  is  a  well  established  and  powerful  technique  for  structural 

characterization of carbon based materials. We  employed this technique to characterize the VGNs 

and  FPNGs.  Fig.  6  shows  the  Raman  spectra  of  the  films  grown  at  different  CH4,  Ar  and  H2 

compositions.  The  Raman  spectra  of  the  samples  are  fitted  with  Lorentzian  profile  and  the 

calculated  parameters  are  given  in  Table  1.  As  shown  in  Fig.  6,  the  spectra  consist  of  several 

Raman modes such as D, G, Dï‚¢, Gï‚¢ (also called as 2D) and D+Dï‚¢ bands which are typical for a 

defective  graphitic system.23,  27 The G band originates from in-plane vibration of  sp2 carbon 

atoms with E2g symmetry at the Brillouin zone center. The D and Dï‚¢ bands, respectively originate 

from  the  process  of  inter-valley  and  intra-valley  double  resonance  which  are  active  only  in 

defective graphitic system. The 2Dï‚¢ band is the overtone of Dï‚¢ band. The peak at ~ 2485 cm-1 is 

assigned  to  D+Dï‚¢ï‚¢  band  which  is  due  to  the  combination  of  D  phonon  and  the  zone  boundary 

phonon corresponding to LA branch. The weak and broad band at around 1100 cm-1 (Dï‚¢ï‚¢ band) 

which can arise due to high density of edges, bond stretching mode of sp3 hydrogenated carbon 

and presence of pentagon rings.30 Due to  polarized Raman effect,  ID/IG ratio is  always large at 

edges than the basal plane. On the other hand, FWHM of G band does not significantly vary at 

edges except for local doping due to edge functionalisation.31 Since the vertical structures have 

extremely    high  density  of  graphene  edges  and  the  FPNG  do  not  have  any  edges  except  grain 

boundaries, we adopted FWHM rather than established ID/IG ratio for structural analysis of the 

NGSs.   

The sample, grown without any dilution gas (Curve no - 1:0:0 in Fig. 5a), exhibits complete 

overlapping of G and Dï‚¢ bands and the observed higher full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 

Gï‚¢ band ( ~ 109 cm-1 ) indicates  defect concentration is high in this sample. As in the case 1, the 

addition of CH4 with Ar leads to continuous decrease in Dï‚¢ band intensity and make it appear as a 

shoulder in G band (Fig. 6(a)). This indicates a reduction of defects with increasing Ar content. 

Further, the case 3(a), also exhibits similar trend in terms of defects as evidenced from Fig. 6(b). 

For case 1 (Table 1), the FWHM of D, G & G' bands decrease monotonically with Ar dilution that 

confirms the reduction in the defect concentration. On the other hand, for case 3(a), no systematic 

variation is observed when a constant H2 added along with Ar.   

This manuscript got published in RSC Adv., 2015,5, 91922-91931

Fig. 6(c) shows the Raman spectra for the samples grown by dilution of CH4 with H2 which 

is  assigned  as  case  2.    The  FWHM  of  the  D,  G  and  G'  bands  decrease  monotonically  with  H2 

dilution as shown in the Table 1 except for higher H2 concentration (1:0:â‰¥5). Also, it clearly shows 

that there is a decrease in disorder as evidenced from the splitting of G and D' bands in contrast to 

the film grown without dilution. However, the defect density is found to be still larger than case 1. 

On the other hand, in case of 3(b) as shown in Fig. 6(d), the defect density is reduced further when 

Ar is introduced and is also evidenced from Table 1. Fig. 6(e) shows the Raman spectra for samples 

grown at  increasing concentration of CH4 with fixed Ar and H2 content. We observe the D' band 

intensity to decrease continuously with CH4 and appears as a small hump in the G band.

Fig. 7 Lorentzian fit of Raman G'-band of nanographite structures grown at 
different  feedstock  gas  compositions  along  with  highly  oriented  pyrolitic 
graphene.  Lorentzian  fit  to  the  data  are  indicated  as  solid  lines.  G'  band 
intensity is normalized with G'3DB band of HOPG for easy comparison.   

This can also be seen in Table 1 as continuous decrease in the FWHM of D and G bands 

implying a decrease in defect intensity with increasing CH4 concentration with fixed Ar and H2 

contents.  Further, except for 5:3:1, the samples grown at feedstock compositions of 1:3:0, 1:0:3, 

1:3:1    and  1:1:3  are  found  to  have  lower  defects  in  comparison  to  the  other  compositions  as 

indicated in Table 1. Thus, it may be inferred that the dilution of CH4 with  about 75% of Ar or H2 

is optimal to achieve lower defect concentration in their respective morphology.   

The line shape, width and position of G' band can be used to probe the number of layers, 

their structural defects and doping.32 Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of G' band for a few selected 

films. The intensity of these spectra is normalized with G'3DB band of highly oriented pyrolytic 

graphite (HOPG) for the sake of clarity. A single Lorentzian peak is found to be the best fit for the 

G' band as illustrated in Fig. 7. The FWHM values varying from 69.8 to 88.4     cm-1 for these 

samples  indicate  that  these  samples  contain  more  than  five  layers  of  graphene.32  However,  the 

single  Lorentzian  profile  signifies  that  the  samples  contain  stacking  fault  disorder.26  The  films 

grown under different compositions also show a turbostratic stacking fault since the G' band could 

be fitted with single Lorentzian profile for all the samples. This is in support of the observation by

Table 1: The extracted parameters from Raman analysis for different nanographitic structures grown on SiO2/Si. 
The  topography  of  the  nanostructures  are  classified  as  isolated  nanoclusters  (I.N),  vertical  (V)  and  planar  (P) 
structures as given in morphology column. The symbol â€˜ * â€™ in column â€˜hâ€™ represents thickness measured by AFM 
and others values are measured by SEM and d represents a discontinuous film. 

HRTEM  analysis  as  discussed  earlier.  On  the  contrary,  G'  band  of  multilayer  HOPG  film  is 

composed of G'3DA and G'3DB bands as shown in Fig. 7. The position of G' band of NGSs with 

respect to G'3DA band of HOPG, is also blue shifted indicating the presence of a few layer graphene.  

The planar structures, that are grown under hydrogen dominant feedstock compositions, 

exhibit a upshift in G band frequency           (upto ~1593 cm-1) when compared to the vertical 

structures as shown in Table 1. The upshift in G band can be attributed to the substrate induced 

doping  whereas  free  standing  vertical  graphene  has  less  influence  from  substrates  and  hence

downshift  in  G  band  is observed.  The  IGï‚¢/IG ratio  is  also  decreased  on  FPNG  in  comparison  to 

vertical  structures.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  influence  of  substrate  on  the  Raman 

spectroscopy of graphene surface.33 As can be seen from Table 1, the FWHM of the D, G and G' 

bands clearly decreases upon dilution with Ar or H2 or Ar+H2 and it proves the improvement of 

crystallinity and reduction of defects with dilution. However, the ID/IG  ratio is not consistent with 

FWHM of Raman bands for the studied materials. The vertical structures have more edges whereas 

the planar structures have more grain boundaries. Hence, the relatively large D-band intensity in 

both  the  cases  is  due  to  the  combination  of  different  types  of  defects  such  as  stacking  fault, 

hydrogenation, edges, grain boundaries, structural defects from various types of point defects and 

adsorbed  functional  groups.  In  such  scenarios  where  more  than  two  defects  contribute, 

quantification  of  each  of  them  is  very  complex  and  extraction  of  individual  contributions  by 

different types of defects to the Raman band is difficult. Apart from this, the strain in the films is 

also known to contribute to the change in FWHM or ID/IG ratio.34 However, the present Raman 

studies reveal that the defect density could be decreased by choosing optimal composition of feed 

gases.  

Discussion 

From  the  sequence  of  SEM  images,  it  is  observed  that  dilution  of  CH4  with  Ar  always  favors 

growth of vertical graphene structures. Further addition of H2 in fixed proportion (5 sccm) along 

with  Ar  produces  statistically  more  stable  vertical  structures  while  minimizing  the  random 

orientations as evidenced by cross sectional SEM analysis (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). On the other 

hand, the films grown with dilution of CH4 with H2 tend to be planar. However, higher H2 dilution 

leads  to  the  erosion  of  initially  grown  layers  into  nanoislands  over  electrically  continuous 

nanographitic film (1:0:5). A further increase in H2 completely wipes out the film and forms a 

discrete nanographitic clusters over SiO2 surface (1:0:7).  

The growth kinetics that dictates formation of different morphological NGSs can be better 

understood  from  the  radicals  produced  in  plasma  under  different  dilution  conditions.  A  few 

important chemical reactions between the hydrocarbon and gases used for dilution in the plasma 

are given below.24, 35

In  PECVD  system,  C2  radicals  are  reported  to  play  a  decisive  role  in  determining  the 

surface morphology and growth rate of the films. The availability of C2 radicals can be enhanced 

by the energetic Ar+ ions. However, fine control over the formation of C2 radicals can be achieved 

by  precious  control  of  H2  flow.  Such  modulation  of  C2  yields  vertical  layers  of  desired  aerial 

density. However the preference of planar morphology in H2 dilution can be understood by the 

following: Higher dose of H2 increases the density of C2H radical as shown in eqn. 3 and thereby 

decreases net density of C2. Further, the available H* radicals also etch out the growing film.  

Fig. 8(a) shows the graphical representation of growth mechanism of NGSs on dielectric 

substrates.  During  pre-cleaning  procedure,  the  Ar  plasma  removes  surface  contaminations  and 

partial  lattice  oxygen  from  SiO2  surface  that,  creates  dangling  bonds/active  sites  on  dielectric 

substrates. The early stage of nucleation is based on direct adsorption of carbon species on these 

defective  SiO2  surface  and  surface  diffusion.36    This  initiates  rapid  nucleation  of  carbon 

nanoislands and formation of a heterogeneous highly defective nanographite buffer layer since the 

growth  rate  is  extremely  high  in  PECVD.  The  coalescence  of  nanoislands  and  further  growth

causes stress at nanographitic grain boundaries and whose release favors nucleation of carbon in 

the  vertical  direction.37  Zhao  et  al.28  reported  that  the  nucleation  of  vertical  growth  could  start 

either from buffer layer or from the surface carbon onions. The plasma parameter such as feedstock 

gas compositions then decides whether the growth of vertical structure to be continued or etched 

out. If the plasma consists of relatively higher concentration of Ar, it would favor the continued 

growth of vertical layers. On the other hand, if the erosion is high due to presence of excess H2 

concentration,  it  leads  to  growth  of  FPNG  films.  Furthermore,  the  plasma  parameters  such  as 

plasma temperature, radicalsâ€™ density are entirely different when the CH4 is diluted with H2 instead 

of Ar.  In particular, the temperature gradients at the substrate surface could be considerably lower 

in the case of H2 dilution, which in turn favor planar growth.35 Further, the concentration of nascent 

hydrogen  becomes  very  high  in  the  plasma  due  to  the  combined  addition  of  hydrogen  while 

fragmenting CH4 and H2 used for dilution. This high density nascent hydrogen chemically etches 

out the vertically growing structures.  

Based  on  SEM  analysis,  an  attempt  is  made  to  derive  a  relationship  between  the 

morphology and the input gas compositions - CH4, Ar and H2 - towards the growth of NGSs and 

a  ternary  field  diagram  demonstrating  the  growth  regimes  is  shown  in  Fig.  8(b).  This  figure 

provides  an  easy  understanding  of  different  growth  morphologies  and  corresponding  gas 

compositions.  In  essence,  it  is  possible  to  tune  morphological  features  of  NGSs  with  optimal 

dilution of CH4 with a mixed proportion of Ar and H2.   

Conclusion  

We  demonstrate  the  growth  and  possibility  of  tunable  morphology  of  nanographite 

structure  (NGSs)  on  SiO2  substrates  using  ECR-PECVD  by  an  appropriate  composition  of 

feedstock gases. It is found that the dilution of CH4 with Ar and H2 results in vertical and planar 

structure respectively and also the intermediate structures are always possible with mixed Ar and 

H2 dilution. The growth mechanism for the different morphological NGSs is due to the competitive 

growth and etching processes. The Raman studies reveal that the dilution of CH4 with carrier gases 

minimizes the defects density. Hence, this study helps to grow NGSs with desired morphology

and structural quality directly on dielectric substrates using a single growth technique. Also, this 

study would provide a clue to grow such structures using other plasma based CVD techniques.
