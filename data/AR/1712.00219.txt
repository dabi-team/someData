ABSTRACT

The deuteration mechanism of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is still being debated. Observations of
deuterium-bearing species in several astronomical sources represent a powerful tool to improve our understanding of the
interstellar chemistry. The doubly deuterated form of the astrophysically interesting Amidogen radical could be a target
of detection in space. In this work, the rotational spectrum of the ND2 radical in its ground vibrational and electronic
X 2B1 states has been investigated between 588 and 1131 GHz using a frequency modulation millimeter/submillimeter-
wave spectrometer. The ND2 has been produced in a free-space glass absorption cell by discharging a mixture of ND3
and Ar. Sixty-four new transition frequencies involving J values from 2 to 5 and Ka values from 0 to 4 have been
measured. A global analysis including all the previous ﬁeld-free pure rotational data has been performed, allowing for
a more precise determination of a very large number of spectroscopic parameters. Accurate predictions of rotational
transition frequencies of ND2 are now available from a few GHz up to several THz.

1. INTRODUCTION

Recent discoveries of multiply deuterated molecules
in the interstellar medium (ISM)
(Ceccarelli et al.
1998; Lis et al. 2002; Vastel et al. 2003; Parise et al.
2004) have conﬁrmed the interest in deuterium-bearing
species, since deuterium fractionation is a powerful tool
to study the evolution of the Solar System (Millar 2002;
Sandford 2002; Roueﬀ et al. 2003). Both gas-phase
models and active chemistry on grain-surface have been
invoked to explain the formation of doubly or even triply
deuterated species and their anomalous large amount
(Roberts et al. 2000; Caselli 2002; Roberts et al. 2003).
Further detections of multiply deuterated species are
thus fundamental to constraint the chemical models
and spectroscopic laboratory data are necessary to the
goal.

The doubly deuterated Amidogen radical, ND2, rep-
resents a possible target, since NH2 is involved in the
formation process of ammonia (Herbst et al. 1987) and
all the deuterated isotopologues of ammonia have been
detected in space (Turner et al. 1978; Roueﬀ et al. 2000;
Lis et al. 2002). The main isotopologue NH2 was ﬁrst
observed in 1943 in a comet (Swing et al. 1943) by opti-
cal astronomy. More recently, it has also been detected
via radio observation of the star-forming region Sagit-
tarius B2 (van Dishoek et al. 1993) and of many other
sources (Hily-Blant et al. 2010; Persson et al. 2010).
in 2015 the rare 15N-substituted isotopo-
Moreover,
logue has been observed through cometary emissions
(Rousselot et al. 2014; Shinnaka et al. 2014). However,
no detection of deuterated Amidogen, even in its mono
deuterated form NHD, has been reported to date.

Nevertheless, the existence of deuterated forms of
Amidogen in ISM seems to be plausible as predicted
by the gas-phase chemical models, in which the dissocia-
tive recombination of partially deuterated intermediates
results in a higher probability for the ejection of a hy-
drogen atom than deuterium. Roueﬀ et al. (2005) pre-
sented a steady state model of the gas phase chemistry
aimed at understanding the deuterium fractionation of
ammonia in various sources: these authors considered
diﬀerent physical conditions and could derive a general
trend. At high density and high depletion, deuteration
of N-containing species results very eﬃcient at 10 K.
Actually, the abundances of singly and multiply deuter-
ated forms of H+
3 can reach exceptionally high values
under conditions of extreme CO-depletion, and these
high degrees of deuteration can propagate to the resid-
ual nitrogen-bearing species (Flower et al. 2006), that
appear to be less depleted and subsist longer in the
gas phase (see Bergin et al. (1997) and Belloche et al.
(2004) for the cases of NH3 and N2H+, respectively).

The deuterium fractionation is sensitive to the temper-
ature, but it remains large for temperatures between
5 and 20 K. Thus, the model predicts high fractional
abundances of ammonia progenitors and their deuter-
ated isotopologues, namely NH, ND, NH2, NHD and
In general, the predicted abun-
ND2, in dense cores.
dance ratios of the deuterated ammonia isotopologues
and their progenitors agree reasonably well with existing
observations, and, noticeably, the fractional abundance
of ND2 is estimated to be from 2 to 9 times larger than
the ND3 abundance.

The ND2 radical has been long studied with vari-
ous spectroscopic tecniques: electronic, Laser Magnetic
Resonance (LMR), Microwave Optical Double Reso-
nance (MODR), millimeter-wave (mmW) and Fourier-
Transform Far InfraRed (FT-FIR) spectroscopy. Brieﬂy,
the rotational constants were ﬁrst derived from the elec-
tronic spectrum (Dressler et al. 1959), while quartic cen-
trifugal distortion and ﬁne interaction parameters were
obtained by means of LMR studies (Hills et al. 1979).
Later on, Cook et al. (1983) determined the hyper-
ﬁne coupling constants using MODR spectroscopy and
Kanada et al. (1991) measured the pure rotational spec-
trum in the range 265 - 531 GHz using a submillimeter-
wave spectrometer. Lastly, Morino et al. (1997) ob-
served the far-infrared spectrum in the 102 - 265 cm−1
region with a high-resolution FT spectrometer.

In the present work, newly observed rotational tran-
sitions from 588 GHz to 1.13 THz have been measured
for ND2 with microwave accuracy. A global analysis in-
cluding also all previous ﬁeld-free rotational data has
been performed thus obtaining a considerably improved
set of spectroscopic constants, from which more accu-
rate predictions of transition frequencies of ND2 can be
produced in a wide range of its rotational spectrum.

2. EXPERIMENT

The rotational spectrum of ND2 radical has been
investigated in selected frequency regions between
588 GHz and 1.13 THz using a source-modulation
millimeter/sub-millimeter wave spectrometer, as in
Dore et al. (2017) and Bizzocchi et al. (2016). The
main sources of radiation were several Gunn diodes
(Radiometer Physics GmbH, J. E. Carlstrom Co) which
emit in the 80-134 GHz frequency range. Higher fre-
quencies were obtained by using passive doublers or
triplers (RPG) in cascade. The sources were phase-
locked to the suitable harmonic of a frequency synthe-
sizer (Schomandl ND 1000) referenced to an external ru-
bidium frequency standard. The frequency modulation
of the radiation was obtained by sine-wave modulating
at 6 kHz the reference signal of the wide-band Gunn

synchronizer. The absorption cell (3.25 m long, 5 cm
in diameter) was equipped with two cylindrical hollow
electrodes 25 cm in length at either end, and was wound
with a plastic pipe for liquid nitrogen circulation. A
liquid-helium-cooled InSb detector (QMC Instr. Ltd.
type QFI/2) was used for detection. The radiation was
phase-sensitively detected by a lock-in ampliﬁer at twice
the modulation frequency, so that the second derivative
of the spectrum proﬁle was displayed.

The ND2 radical was produced with an electrical glow-
discharge system. A mixture of ND3 (5-7 mTorr) and
Ar (20 mTorr) was used, as in Kanada et al. (1991).
Typically, a discharge current of 70 mA and a voltage
of about 1 kV were maintained between the electrodes
while recording the spectrum. The absorption cell was
cooled continuously just above the freezing point of am-
monia with liquid nitrogen, in order to avoid an exces-
sive overheating of the two electrodes. The estimated
uncertainties of the measurements are 50 kHz in most
cases, 100 kHz in a few cases. The accuracy depends on
the signal to noise ratio of the observed spectrum and on
line-blending due to unresolved hyperﬁne components.

3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The ND2 radical in its electronic ground state X 2B1 is
an asymmetric rotor of C2v symmetry whose dipole mo-
ment (1.82 D) lies along the b axis (Brown et al. 1979).
Because of the spin of the unpaired electron (S = 1
2 )
and the spin of the 14N nucleus (IN = 1), this radi-
cal shows a complex spectrum with ﬁne and hyperﬁne
structures (see Figure 1). In fact, each rotational level
with quantum number N 6= 0 is split into two sublevels
with J = N + 1
2 because of the cou-
pling of the rotation with the electron spin. Each of
these two sublevels is then split by the interaction with

2 and J = N − 1

the nuclear spin of 14N. A further splitting of the ni-
trogen hyperﬁne components is due to deuterium nu-
clear spin. Deuterium is a boson (ID = 1), therefore
the total wavefunction has to be symmetric upon ex-
change of the two identical nuclei, that is of A symmetry.
Since the X 2B1 electronic state is antisymmetric and
the vibrational ground state is symmetric, then sym-
metric rotational levels (K−1K1 = (ee) or (oo)) com-
bine with antisymmetric deuterium spin functions, with
ID = ID1 + ID2 = 1, while antisymmetric rotational lev-
els (K−1K1 = (eo) or (oe)) combine with spin functions
with ID = 0, 2, which are symmetric upon exchange of
the D nuclei. Thus the symmetric rotational levels are
split in three further hyperﬁne sublevels and the anti-
symmetric ones in six sublevels. Therefore the coupling
scheme used in the present work is the following:

ˆJ = ˆN + ˆS
ˆF1 = ˆJ + ˆIN
ˆF = ˆF1 + ˆID.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the ND2 radical can be

expressed as (Kanada et al. 1991; Morino et al. 1997):

ˆH = ˆHrot + ˆHf s + ˆHhf s,

(1)

where ˆHrot is the Watson A-reduced Hamiltonian in the
I r representation (Watson 1977), which includes the
rotational energy and the centrifugal distortion terms.
The ﬁne-structure Hamiltonian ˆHf s contains the elec-
tron spin-rotation terms with constants ǫii and their
centrifugal dependences. The ˆHhf s operator is the
hyperﬁne-structure Hamiltonian and can be separated
into two components:

ˆHhf s = ˆHhf s(N ) + ˆHhf s(D).

Melosso et al.

In the present analysis, the eﬀect of isotropic (aF )
and anisotropic (Tii) electronic spin-nuclear spin cou-
pling constants were considered for both nuclei, while
electric quadrupole (eQq) and spin-rotation (Cii) cou-
pling constants could be determined only for the 14N-
nitrogen nucleus.

The initial predictions were made using the Pickett’s
program SPCAT (Pickett 1991) with the constants de-
rived by Kanada et al. (1991). The production of ND2
was optimized by observing the J = 0 ← 0 component
of the N = 110 ← 101 transition. Then, the ﬁne compo-
nents of new eight rotational transitions were recorded
and their hyperﬁne structure could be easily assigned
thanks to the already known hyperﬁne-interaction pa-
rameters. Sixty-four distinct frequencies were measured
and analyzed in a weighted least-squares procedure, in
which previous data (millimeter/sub-millimeter, MODR
In this procedure,
and FIR studies) were included.
performed with the Pickett’s program SPFIT (Pickett
1991), the mmW and sub-mmW lines previously mea-
sured by Kanada et al. (1991) were given uncertainties
of 50 kHz, whereas the FIR data from Morino et al.
(1997) were given uncertainties of 0.0007 cm-1, as in the
analysis of NH2 (M¨uller et al. 1999). For the MODR
data (Cook et al. 1983) the same uncertainties given in
the original work were assumed (typically 0.5 MHz).
Surprisingly, the older sets of frequency data were never
analyzed simultaneously, so that diﬀerent sets of spec-
troscopic constants, not fully consistent, have been re-
ported in the literature for ND2. The present global
analysis allows to obtain spectroscopy constants which
are compatible with the entire body of rotational data
available for this radical. Moreover, we were able to
complete and/or correct previous assignments. As far as
MODR data are concerned, about 20% of the observed
transitions were not considered in the ﬁt of Cook et al.
(1983) because of the failure to unambiguously assign
their hyperﬁne components. Our more extensive data
analysis allowed us to overcome this diﬃculty, so that
a large number of previously unused MODR frequencies
could be included in our ﬁt. Furthermore, during the
merging process some FIR transitions appeared to be
misassigned, so they have been reassigned correctly in
this study. In particular, a few transitions with N ≥ 10
had been wrongly assigned as ∆Ka = ±3 instead of
∆Ka = ±1. In the ﬁnal ﬁt, unresolved lines were treated
using the intensity-weighted average of the individual
components involved. A total number of 41 spectro-
scopic constants were included in the least squares anal-
ysis, giving a satisfactory dimensionless standard devi-
ation of 0.87. Table 1 shows the list of spectroscopic
parameters determined in the present work, where they

are compared to those obtained previously. In general,
all derived parameters are determined with higher pre-
cision than in the previous works:
for instance, the
standard errors of the rotational constants are one or-
der of magnitude lower and the hyperﬁne constants are
three times more precise. This is mainly due to the si-
multaneous analysis of MW spectroscopy measurements
(high frequency precision and resolving power) with FT-
FIR data (large range of N and Ka quantum num-
bers). The newly determined values of the spectroscopic
constants agree well with those previously reported by
Kanada et al. (1991) and Morino et al. (1997), the only
exceptions being φK and lK. This discrepancy should
be ascribed to the reassignment process of some FIR
transitions (see above).

It is well known that the lightness and non-rigidity
of triatomic hydrides of C2v symmetry (e.g. CH2,
H2O, NH2) cause abnormal centrifugal distortion eﬀects
(Br¨unken et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2012; Martin-Drumel et al.
2014), so that describing the rotational energy levels
using a Watson-type Hamiltonian presents some dif-
ﬁculties due to the slow convergence of the standard
power series expansion of the rotational angular mo-
mentum operators. As a matter of fact, a huge number
of centrifugal distortion terms (mainly Ka dependent)
has to be included in the Hamiltonian model in or-
der to reproduce highly accurate rotational data within
their experimental uncertainty. This diﬃculties are less
pronounced for the heavier doubly deuterated isotopo-
logues, for which the centrifugal distortion eﬀects are
smaller. As far as the Amidogen radical is concerned,
on the average the quartic centrifugal distortion con-
stants determined for ND2 are ca. three times smaller
than those of NH2, and the sextic ones ca. seven times
smaller (Martin-Drumel et al. 2014). No problem of
convergence has been experienced in the present anal-
ysis using the standard semi-rigid Hamiltonian, so that
the experimental transition frequencies could be satis-
factorily reproduced (σ = 0.87) using, as ﬁt parameters,
16 centrifugal distortion constants less than in the case
of NH2 (Martin-Drumel et al. 2014). For this reason no
other form of the rotational Hamiltonian was considered
for the analysis.

Table 2 provides an example of the machine-readable
table included as Electronic Supplementary Informa-
tion. Files used with the SPFIT/SPCAT program suite
are also included as supplementary materials. These
ﬁles can be used to predict the rotational spectrum at
a given temperature and in selected frequency regions.
It should be noted that the prediction of transition
frequencies corresponding to quantum numbers higher
than those involved in the present analysis (i.e. N > 13

to the truncation of the slowly convergent power series
expansion of the standard semi-rigid Hamiltonian. It is
not easy to make an a priori evaluation of the magnitude
of these model-dependent errors, however an estimate
of the convergence radius of a power series can provide
useful information (Br¨unken et al. 2005). For instance,
considering the series of the purely Ka dependent cen-
n
trifugal distortion terms, Pn cn (cid:0)K 2
, its convergence
a(cid:1)
radius is the inverse square-root of the absolute value of
limn→∞ cn/cn−1, which can be estimated from the inter-
cept of the plot of cn/cn−1 versus 1/n. For the present
centrifugal analysis, a convergence radius of Ka = 17 re-

holds, therefore the missing higher order term gives a
substantial contribution to the energy of the level. In
conclusion, the semi-rigid Hamiltonian with the present
set of constants if fully accurate to predict the ND2 spec-
trum for Ka 6 10, it is still appropriate, with less ac-
curacy, for 10 < Ka 6 17, but for Ka > 17 no reliable
predictions of the spectrum can be obtained.

4. CONCLUSION

The rotational spectrum of the doubly deuterated
variant of Amidogen radical ND2 in its ground electronic
state X 2B1 has been investigated in the frequency re-
gion 588 - 1131 GHz. New measurements have been
analyzed in a global ﬁt including previous mmW, sub-
mmW, MODR and FIR data. Some misassignments or
incomplete assignments of previous data sets have been
corrected, so that it has been possible to obtain a set
of very accurate spectroscopy constants which are com-
patible with the entire body of rotational data presently
available for this radical. Accurate predictions are now
available up to 8 THz for those transitions with N 6 13
and Ka 6 10. This work provides a facility set of data
for the radio-observation of fully deuterated Amidogen
radical.
