STRONGLY EXCHANGE RINGS

MANUEL CORT´ES-IZURDIAGA AND PEDRO A. GUIL ASENSIO

Abstract. Two elements a, b in a ring R form a right coprime pair, written
ha, bi, if aR+bR = R. Right coprime pairs have shown to be quite useful in the
study of left cotorsion or exchange rings. In this paper, we deﬁne the class of
strongly right exchange rings in terms of descending chains of them. We show
that they are semiregular and that this class of rings contains left injective,
left pure-injective, left cotorsion, local and left continuous rings. This allows
us to give a uniﬁed study of all these classes of rings in terms of the behaviour
of descending chains of right coprime pairs.

1. Introduction and notation

i ≤ Ni such that X = M ′ ⊕ (⊕I N ′

The exchange property was introduced by Crawley and Jonsson in 1964 in their
study of the decomposition properties of algebraic systems [4, Deﬁnition 3.1] and
was later extended to arbitrary modules by Warﬁeld in 1972 [18]. He deﬁned that
a right module M satisﬁes the (ﬁnite) exchange property if for any right module
X and decompositions X = M ′ ⊕ Y = ⊕I Ni with M ′ ∼= M (resp., with I ﬁnite),
there exist submodules N ′
i ). It is well known
that the ﬁnite exchange property implies the general exchange property for ﬁnitely
generated modules, but it is not known if this is true for every module. This is
one of the oldest open questions in Ring Theory, whose origin can be traced back
to the pioneering work of Crawley and Jonsson (see [4, p.807]). Warﬁeld proved
that a module M satisﬁes the ﬁnite exchange property if and only if so does its
endomorphism ring. He also proved that this property is left-right symmetric for
rings and called them exchange rings [18]. Exchange rings were later independently
characterized by Goodearl [9, p. 167] and Nicholson [15] as those rings R satisfying
that for any element r ∈ R, there exists an idempotent e ∈ R such that e ∈ rR and
1 − e ∈ (1 − r)R. See [10, 12] for a more detailed exposition on this topic and its
relation with algebraic equations.

On the other hand, we recall that a pair a, b of elements in a commutative PID,
R, is called coprime if they do not have common divisors. This is equivalent to say
that they satisfy the Bezout identity ar + bs = 1, for some r, s ∈ R. This deﬁnition
has been recently extended to arbitrary (not necessarily commutative) rings in a
completely diﬀerent context [7]. Namely, a pair of elements a, b in a ring R is called
right coprime, denoted ha, bi, when they satisfy the former condition; and an order
relation was deﬁned among them: ha, bi ≤ ha′, b′i if and only if aR ⊆ a′R and
bR ⊆ b′R.
It was shown in [7] that this order relation is a quite useful tool to
construct idempotent elements in rings. Using these ideas, the authors have proved

that any left cotorsion ring is semiregular (that is, R is von Neumann regular modulo
its Jacobson radical J(R) and idempotents in R/J(R) can be lifted to idempotents
in R, see [16]) and R/J(R) is left self-injective. In particular, they have given an
arithmetic (and probably more conceptual) proof of the fact that endomorphism
rings of pure-injective modules enjoy the former properties (see e.g. [21]).

The main tool in most of the proofs in [7] is that certain descending chains of
right coprime pairs (the compatible ones, see Deﬁnition 3.1) have minimal lower
bounds (with respect to the aforementioned order relation), and these lower bounds
are of the form he, 1 − ei for some idempotent element e. Let us note that this fact
connects Goodearl and Nicholson characterization of exchange rings with coprime
pairs: a ring R is an exchange ring if and only if for every element r ∈ R, there
exists a minimal right coprime pair below the right coprime pair hr, 1 − ri. This
key observation is the inspiration idea of the present paper. We call rings satisfying
the above descending property right strongly exchange rings and study their main
properties. We show that the class of right strongly exchange rings contains left
cotorsion rings (hence, left self-injective and left pure-injective rings), left perfect
rings, local rings and left continuous rings. Moreover, right strongly exchange rings
are semiregular. Consequently, this right strongly exchange property allows to
unify the treatment of all the above classes of rings, which had been shown to be
semiregular as well.

Let us outline the contents of this paper. We begin by obtaining in Section 2 the
basic properties of right coprime pairs. We also give in this section several examples
that show the behaviour of right coprime pairs in diﬀerent rings, and observe that
this behaviour characterize local, left perfect, von Neumann regular and exchange
rings (see Proposition 2.5).

In Section 3, we deﬁne right strongly exchange rings in terms of the central notion
of compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs. By the preceding comments,
right strongly exchange rings satisfy the exchange property, although there exist
exchange rings which are not right strongly exchange (see Example 3.5). We also
show that the class of right strongly exchange rings include local, left cotorsion and
left continuous rings (Proposition 3.7 and Theorems 3.6 and 3.11).

We study in Section 4 the main properties of right strongly exchange rings.
We prove in Theorem 4.3 that they are semiregular.
If we assume the stronger
property that compatible descending systems of right coprime pairs have minimal
lower bounds, then they are left continuous modulo their Jacobson radical (Theorem
4.9). We also give an example showing that the strongly exchange property is not
left-right symmetric (Example 4.10). We close the paper by showing that a ring is
semiperfect provided that it has a countable number of idempotents and is strongly
exchange (Theorem 4.11).

Let us ﬁx some notation. For any set A, |A| will denote its cardinality. The
ﬁrst inﬁnite ordinal is denoted by ω. Moreover, R will denote an associative ring
with identity that we ﬁx for the whole paper. Module will mean right R-module
and, when dealing with left modules, we will specify the side where scalars act.
We denote by Mod-R and R-Mod the categories of right and left R-modules, re-
spectively. As usual, we use the notation RR (resp. RR) when we consider R
as a right (resp.
left) R-module over itself. Morphisms will act on the opposite
side of scalars. Consequently, if M , N and L are modules and f : M → N and
g : N → L are homomorphisms of modules, we denote their composition by gf in
case M, N, L ∈ Mod-R and by f g if M, N, L ∈ R-Mod. We will denote by J(R) the
Jacobson radical of R. Given a family of modules, {Mi | i ∈ I}, we treat elements
i∈I Mi with x(i) ∈ Mi for each i ∈ I. The support
in

i∈I Mi as maps x : I →

of an element x in the product is

supp(x) = {i ∈ I | x(i) 6= 0}.

Recall that a submodule K of a module M is called superﬂuous, written K <<
M , if there does not exist a proper submodule L of M with K + L = M . Dually,
K is called essential in M if there does not exist a non-zero submodule L with
K ∩ L = 0. A family of submodules {Mi | i ∈ I} of M is called independent if for
j6=i Mj = 0. Given X ⊆ M and A ⊆ R, we denote by lM (A)
every i ∈ I, Mi ∩
and rR(X) the corresponding annihilators of A in M and of X in R, respectively.
Notice that, if e is an idempotent element, lR(e) = R(1 − e) and rR(e) = (1 − e)R.

2. Coprime pairs. Basic properties

We begin this section by recalling the following deﬁnition from [7].

Deﬁnition 2.1. A right coprime pair in R is a pair of elements, a, b, such that
R = aR + bR. We denote the coprime pair by ha, bi.

We are interested in the cyclic right ideals generated by the elements in the right
coprime pair. This is the reason why we deﬁne the following equivalence relation
between them:

ha, bi ∼ ha′, b′i ⇔ aR = a′R and bR = b′R
We denote by RCP(R) the set of all equivalence classes of right coprime pairs
under this equivalence relation. From now on, the term ”right coprime pair” and
the notation ha, bi will refer to one of these equivalence classes. Given a right
coprime pair ha, bi, any pair of elements (a′, b′) of R2 such that ha′, b′i = ha, bi will
be called a pair of generators of the coprime pair.

We may deﬁne in RCP(R) an order relation. Given two right coprime pairs ha, bi

and ha′, b′i, we will say that

ha, bi ≤ ha′, b′i if and only if aR ≤ a′R and bR ≤ b′R.

As we will see later on, this order relation is quite useful to ﬁnd idempotent

elements in R.

Examples 2.2.

(1) For any a ∈ R, we have the coprime pair ha, 1 − ai. We

call this coprime pair basic.

(2) For any a ∈ R and any unit u ∈ R, we have the coprime pair ha, ui. We

call this coprime pair trivial. Notice that h0, 1i ≤ ha, ui.

(3) If e ∈ R is an idempotent, then he, 1 − ei is a basic coprime pair which is
easy to check that is minimal in RCP(R) with respect to ≤ (see [7]).
(4) Recall that, given a ∈ R, aR is a direct summand of RR if and only if a
is a regular element. I.e., there exists an x ∈ R with axa = a. If ha, bi is
a right coprime pair, then aR and bR are direct summands if and only if
a and b are regular elements. We call this kind of coprime pairs regular.
Notice that, in this case, we can ﬁnd idempotent elements e and f such that
ha, bi = he, f i.

Let us prove some basic characterizations of right coprime pairs. Recall that a
left R module M satisﬁes the condition (C3) if for any two direct summands, K
and L, of M , K + L is a direct summand provided that K ∩L = 0 (see e.g. [13, 14]).

Proposition 2.3. Let a, b ∈ R. The following assertions are equivalent:

(1) ha, bi is a right coprime pair.
(2) The morphism of left R-modules, i : R → R ⊕ R given by (x)i = (xa, xb),

is a split monomorphism.

4

MANUEL CORT´ES-IZURDIAGA AND GUIL ASENSIO

(3) There exists a left R-module M and two elements m1 and m2 of M such
that the morphism f : R → M deﬁned by (1)f = am1 + bm2 is a split
monomorphism.

(4) lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0 and R(a, b) is a direct summand of R ⊕ R.

(5) lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0 and there exist r, s, x0, y0 ∈ R such that

an idempotent matrix and

ra rb

is

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(x0, y0)

ra rb

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

= (a, b)

(6) lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0 and there exist r, s ∈ R such that rR(r) ∩ rR(s) = 0 and

ra rb
sa sb

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

is an idempotent matrix.

(7) ha + J(R), b + J(R)i is a right coprime pair in R/J(R).

If R is von Neumann regular, or RR satisﬁes (C3) and a and b are idempotent
elements, the preceding conditions are equivalent to:

(8) lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Suppose that ha, bi is a right coprime pair. Then the morphism
k : R ⊕ R → R given by (x, y)k = xr + ys is a splitting of i, where r and s are
scalars satisfying 1 = ar + bs.

(2) ⇒ (3). Trivial.
(3) ⇒ (1). Note that if g splits f , then

1 = (1)f g = a(m1)g + b(m2)g,

which implies that ha, bi is a right coprime pair.

(2) ⇔ (4). The equivalence follows from the fact that Ker i = lR(a) ∩ lR(b) and

Im i = R(a, b).

(4) ⇒ (5). If R(a, b) is a direct summand of R ⊕ R, there exists an idempotent
endomorphism h of R ⊕ R such that Im h = R(a, b). The endomorphism h is of the
form

(x, y)h = (x, y)

u v
w t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

u v
w t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

for some idempotent matrix

with entries in R. Using that (1, 0)h and

(0, 1)h belong to R(a, b) we can ﬁnd r, s ∈ R such that u = ra, v = rb, w = sa, t =
sb. Finally, since (a, b) ∈ Im h, there exist x0, y0 ∈ R such that

(x0, y0)

ra rb
sa sb

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

= (a, b)

(5) ⇒ (4). The endomorphism h of R ⊕ R given by

(x, y)h = (x, y)

ra rb
sa sb

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

for all x, y ∈ R, is idempotent with Im h = R(a, b). Then, R(a, b) is a direct
summand of R ⊕ R.

(1) ⇒ (6). Since i is injective, 0 = Ker i = lR(a) ∩ lR(b). Now take r, s ∈ R such

that ar + bs = 1 and note that

ra rb
sa sb

=

s(ar + bs)a s(ar + bs)b

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

ra rb
sa sb

(cid:19)

Moreover, since hr, si is a left coprime pair, it satisﬁes the dual of (2) and j : R →
R ⊕ R given by j(x) = (rx, sx) is injective. This means that rR(r) ∩ rR(s) = 0.

(6) ⇒ (1). Using that the matrix is idempotent we obtain the identities
(ra)2 + rbsa = ra
rarb + rbsb = rb

sara + sbsa = sa
sarb + (sb)2 = sb

The ﬁrst two identities together with lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0 give that rar + rbs − r = 0.
Similarly, from the last two identities we get that sar + sbs − s = 0. Now, using
that rR(r) ∩ rR(s) = 0 we obtain that ar + bs = 1. That is, ha, bi is a right coprime
pair.

(1) ⇒ (7). This is trivial.
(7) ⇒ (1). Note that (7) implies that aR+bR+J(R) = R. Then, by Nakayama’s

lemma, aR + bR = R as well.

(4) ⇒ (8). Trivial.
(8) ⇒ (1). If R is von Neumann regular, then R(a, b) is always a direct summand

of R ⊕ R. Consequently, ha, bi is a right coprime pair by (4).

Finally, if RR satisﬁes (C3) and a and b are idempotents satisfying (5), then
R(1 − a) ∩ R(1 − b) = 0. By condition (C3), R(1 − a) + R(1 − b) is a direct summand
(cid:3)
of R. Therefore, ha, bi is a right coprime pair by [21, Lemma 12].

By a minimal coprime pair we mean a right coprime pair which is minimal in
RCP(R). We will use the following description of minimal coprime pairs (see [7,
Proposition 3]).

Proposition 2.4. Let ha, bi be a right coprime pair. The following assertions are
equivalent:

(1) The coprime pair ha, bi is minimal.
(2) There exists an idempotent element e such that ha, bi = he, 1 − ei.
(3) There exist r, s ∈ R such that a = ara, b = bsb (i. e., ha, bi is regular and

arbs = bsar = 0).

Proof. In order to prove (1) ⇒ (2), suppose that ha, bi is a minimal coprime pair
and write 1 = ar + bs. Then har, bsi ≤ ha, bi and, since ha, bi is minimal, har, bsi is
also minimal. By [7, Proposition 3] both ar and bs are idempotents.

(2) ⇒ (3). Write e = ar, a = er′, 1 − e = bs and b = (1 − e)s′. Then a = ara,

b = bsb and arbs = bsar = 0.

(3) ⇒ (1). By (3), ar and bs are orthogonal idempotents with arR = aR and
bsR = bR. Then arR ⊕ bsR = R. This means that har, bsi = ha, bi is a minimal
(cid:3)
right coprime pair.

We obtain now some characterizations of rings R in terms of the properties of
their poset RCP(R). Recall from the introduction that R is called an exchange ring
if R has the ﬁnite exchange property as a right (equivalently, left) module, that is,
for any module X and decompositions

X = M ⊕ N = A ⊕ B
with M ∼= RR, there exist submodules A′ ≤ A and B′ ≤ B such that X =
M ⊕ A′ ⊕ B′. Moreover, R is said to be right quasi-duo if every maximal right ideal
is a left ideal.

Proposition 2.5. Let R be a ring. Then:

(1) RR is indecomposable if and only if (RCP(R), ≤) has exactly two minimal

elements.

(2) The following assertions are equivalent:

6

MANUEL CORT´ES-IZURDIAGA AND GUIL ASENSIO

(a) R is local.
(b) Every right coprime pair is trivial.
(c) The following two conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) RCP(R) has exactly two minimal elements.
(ii) For each ha, bi ∈ RCP(R), there exists a minimal right coprime

pair hc, di such that hc, di ≤ ha, bi.

(3) R is left perfect if and only if R has DCC on right coprime pairs.
(4) R is von Neumann regular if and only if every right coprime pair is regular.
(5) R is an exchange ring if and only if for every right coprime pair ha, bi there

exists a minimal right coprime pair hc, di with hc, di ≤ ha, bi.

(6) R is right quasi-duo if and only if every left coprime pair is a right coprime

pair.

Proof. (1). Note ﬁrst that the right coprime pairs h1, 0i and h0, 1i are always
minimal in RCP(R).

Suppose now that RR is indecomposable and let ha, bi ∈ RCP(R) be minimal.
By Proposition 2.4, aR ⊕ bR = R. Since R is indecomposable, aR = R or bR = R.
In the ﬁrst case, h1, 0i = ha, bi. And, in the second, h0, 1i = ha, bi.

Assume now that h1, 0i and h0, 1i are the only minimal elements of RCP(R) and
let e ∈ R be an idempotent. As he, 1−ei is a minimal right coprime pair in RCP(R)
by Proposition 2.4, we get that he, 1 − ei = h1, 0i or he, 1 − ei = h0, 1i, which means
that e ∈ {0, 1}. Thus, RR is indecomposable.

(2). (a) ⇔ (b) follows from the fact that R is local if and only if every proper

right ideal of R is superﬂuous.

(b) ⇒ (c). Trivial, since the hypotheses imply that h0, 1i ≤ ha, bi or h1, 0i ≤ ha, bi

for any right coprime pair ha, bi.

(c) ⇒ (a). First, note that h1, 0i and h0, 1i are the only minimal elements in
RCP(R). Choose two right ideals I and K of R such that I +K = R. Then 1 = y+k
for some y ∈ I and k ∈ K. By hypothesis, h1, 0i ≤ hy, ki or h0, 1i ≤ hy, ki which
implies that hy, ki is trivial. This means that I = R or K = R and, consequently,
that R is local.

(3) If ha0, b0i ≥ ha1, b1i ≥ ha2, b2i ≥ · · ·

is a countable descending chain of
right coprime pairs, then, since R is left perfect, both chains a0R ≥ a1R ≥ · · ·
and b0R ≥ b1R ≥ · · · stabilize.
In particular, there exist an n < ω such that
han, bni = han+kbn+ki for each k < ω.

Conversely, if R has DCC on right coprime pairs and a0R ≥ a1R ≥ a2R ≥ · · ·

is a descending chain of cyclic right ideals, then the chain of right coprime pairs

ha0, 1i ≥ ha1, 1i ≥ ha2, 1i ≥ · · ·

stabilizes, which implies that there exists an n < ω such that anR = an+kR for
each k < ω.

(4) Trivial.
(5) Suppose that R is an exchange ring and let ha, bi be a right coprime pair.
Writing 1 = ar + bs for some r, s ∈ R, we get that har, 1 − ari ≤ ha, bi. Now, by
[15, Theorem 2.1], there exists an idempotent e with eR ≤ arR and (1 − e)R ≤
(1 − ar)R. By Proposition 2.4, he, 1 − ei is a minimal right coprime pair which
satisﬁes he, 1 − ei ≤ ha, bi.

Conversely, given x ∈ R, there exists a minimal right coprime pair hc, di with
hc, di ≤ hx, 1 − xi . By Proposition 2.4, there exists an idempotent e such that
hc, di = he, 1 − ei. Again by [15, Theorem 2.1], this implies that R is an exchange
ring.

(6) This is proved in [11, Theorem 3.2].

Remark 2.6. Note that R is local if and only if R is exchange and RCP(R) has
exactly two minimal elements.

3. Strongly exchange rings. Examples

As we mentioned in the introduction, one of the key ingredients in [7] is that
certain descending chains of right coprime pairs have lower bounds. In this section,
we give the central notion of compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs,
and study the lower bounds of them.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs is a chain of
right coprime pairs, {pα | α < κ}, such that, for each α < κ, there exists a pair of
generators (aα, bα) of pα, and families of scalars {rαβ | α < β} and {sαβ | α < β},
satisfying the following two conditions for each ordinals α < γ < β with β < κ.

(1) aβ = aαrαβ and bβ = bαsαβ;
(2) rαβ = rαγrγβ and sαβ = sαγsγβ.

From now on, if {haα, bαi | α < κ} is a compatible descending chain of right
coprime pairs, we will assume that (aα, bα) is the pair of generators satisfying the
compatibility condition of the preceding deﬁnition.

Of course, we could have deﬁned descending chains with the index set being a
totally ordered set instead of an ordinal. However, since every totally ordered set
contains a coﬁnal well ordered subset (see e.g.[17, Theorem 36]), we can always
assume that the index set of the chain is a well ordered set.

We are interested in studying when these chains have lower bounds in RCP(R).
A minimal lower bound of a chain is a lower bound of the chain that is a minimal
element in RCP(R).

Proposition 3.2. Let {haα, bαi | α < κ} be a descending chain of right coprime
pairs. Then:

(1) The chain has a lower bound if and only if

aαR +

bαR = R

α<κ
\
(2) If haα, bαi is regular for each α < κ, then the chain is compatible.

In
particular, every descending chain of right coprime pairs in a von Neumann
regular ring is compatible.

α<κ
\

(3) If R is von Neumann regular, the following are equivalent:

(a) The chain has a lower bound.
(b) There exist a, b ∈ R with lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0,

α<κ lR(bα) ≤ lR(b).

α<κ lR(aα) ≤ lR(a) and

Conversely, write 1 = a + b with a ∈
a right coprime pair and a lower bound of the system.

(2) Since haα, bαi is regular, we may assume that aα and bα are idempotent
elements for each α < κ. Given α < β, we have that aαaβ = aβ, since aβ = aαr for
some r ∈ R. Then the families of scalars {rαβ | α < β} and {sαβ | α < β}, given
by rαβ = aβ and sαβ = bβ, for each pair α < β, make the chain compatible.

(3) Again, we may assume that aα and bα are idempotent elements for each α.
(a) ⇒ (b). Take ha, bi a lower bound of the chain. Then lR(a) ∩ lR(b) = 0 by

Proposition 2.3. Moreover, the inclusions

aαR ≥ aR and

bαR ≥ bR

(b) ⇒ (a). Since R is von Neumann regular, we may assume that a and b are
idempotents. By Proposition 2.3, ha, bi is a right coprime pair. Moreover, since
aR = rRlR(a) and aαR = rRlR(aαR) for each α < κ, we get, by [1, Propositions
2.15 and 2.16] that

aR = rRlR(a) ≤ rR

And, similarly,

(cid:3)

Motivated by the preceding results, we introduce the following natural notion of

strongly exchange ring:

Deﬁnition 3.3. We say that a ring R is right strongly exchange if every compatible
descending chain of right coprime pairs has a minimal lower bound.

Examples 3.4.

(1) Let R be an integral domain. Then, for every pair of el-
ements a and b such that a ∈ bR, there exists a unique r ∈ R such that
a = br. As a consequence, every descending chain of right coprime pairs is
compatible.

(2) Z is not a strongly exchange ring since, for instance, if p and q are diﬀerent
primes, the compatible descending chain {hpn, qni | n < ω} does not have a
lower bound.

We show an example of an exchange ring which is not right strongly exchange.
Actually, we are going to construct, for any regular cardinal κ, a von Neumann
regular ring S such that all compatible descending chains of right coprime pairs of
cardinality smaller than κ have minimal lower bounds, but there does exist a chain
of length κ with no lower bound.

Recall that a cardinal κ is called singular if there exists a cardinal µ < κ and a
α<µ κα.

family of cardinals {κα | α < µ} with κα < κ for each α, such that κ =
A cardinal is called regular when it is not singular.

Example 3.5. Let κ be an inﬁnite regular cardinal. There exists a von Neumann
regular ring S satisfying that:

(1) Every compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs of length smaller

than κ has a minimal lower bound.

(2) There exists a compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs with no

lower bound.

Since every von Neumann regular ring is an exchange ring, this example shows that
exchange rings do not need to be strongly exchange.

Proof. Let F a ﬁeld and S, the subring of F κ given by

{x ∈ F κ | ∃C ⊆ κ with |C| < κ and x(α) = x(β) ∀α, β ∈ κ \ C}.

It is clear that S is von Neumann regular, since for any x ∈ S, x is of the form

xyx, where, for each α, y(α) = x(α)−1 if x(α) 6= 0, and y(α) = 0 otherwise.

(1) First note that x ∈ S is idempotent if and only if x(α) ∈ {0, 1} for each α < κ
and one of the sets, {α < κ | x(α) = 1} or {α < κ | x(α) = 0}, has cardinality

smaller than κ. Indeed, if Γ is any subset of κ and we denote by eΓ the element of
F κ satisfying that

(cid:26)
then the set of idempotents of S is {eΓ | Γ ⊆ κ and |Γ| < κ or |κ \ Γ| < κ}.

eΓ(α) =

if α ∈ Γ
if α /∈ Γ

Let us choose an ordinal λ < κ and a descending chain of right coprime pairs
{haα, bαi | α < λ}. We may assume that both aα and bα are idempotents. Since
haα, bαi is a right coprime pair,

(1)

for each α < λ.

supp(aα) ∪ supp(bα) = κ,

Let us denote by Γ =
(A) Γ ∪ ∆ = κ.
(B) Either Γ or κ \ Γ has cardinality smaller than κ. And, similarly, either ∆

α<κ supp(bα). We claim that

α<κ supp(aα) and ∆ =

or κ \ ∆ has cardinality smaller than κ.

Assume that this claim is already proved and choose the idempotents eΓ and e∆.
They belong to S by (B). And heΓ, e∆i is a right coprime pair by (A), which is
clearly a lower bound of the initial chain. Therefore, heΓ, e∆\Γi is a minimal lower
bound of the chain.

Let us prove our claim. In order to prove (A), take x ∈ κ. Then x ∈ supp(a0)
If x /∈ supp(b0), then
or x ∈ supp(b0) by equation (1). Suppose x ∈ supp(a0).
If
x ∈ Γ by (1) and we are done.
x ∈ supp(aα) ∩ supp(bα) for each α, then x ∈ Γ ∩ ∆ and we are done. Otherwise,
take α the minimum ordinal such that x /∈ supp(aα) ∩ supp(bα) and assume, by
(1), that x ∈ supp(aα). Then, again by (1), x ∈ Γ. This proves claim (A).

If x ∈ supp(b0), we have two possibilities.

In order to prove (B), let us we check that either Γ or κ \ Γ has cardinality
smaller than κ. The proof involving ∆ is similar. If there exists an α < κ such that
| supp(aα)| < κ, then Γ ⊆ supp(aα) has cardinality smaller than κ. If | supp(aα)| =
κ for each α < λ, then |κ \ supp(aα)| < κ. Therefore,

|κ \ Γ| ≤

|κ \ supp(aα)| < κ

since κ is regular and λ < κ.

(2) Let I1 and I2 be two subsets of κ such that |I1| = |I2| = κ, I1 ∩ I2 = ∅ and
κ = I1 ∪ I2. Consider in I1 and I2 the orders induced by κ and set, for each α < κ,
Γα = κ \ {β ∈ I1 | β < α} and ∆α = κ \ {γ ∈ I2 | γ < α}. We obtain a descending
chain of right coprime pairs {heΓα, e∆αi | α < κ}. Let us check that this chain does
not have a lower bound. Suppose that ha, bi is a lower bound. Then

α<κ supp(eΓα),
α<κ supp(e∆α) and

(i) supp(a) ⊆
(ii) supp(b) ⊆
(iii) supp(a) ∪ supp(b) = κ.
α<κ supp(eΓα )
Since I1 ∩

We have proved that | supp(a)| = |{α < κ | a(α) = 0}| = κ, which contradicts
(cid:3)

that a ∈ R.

Now we show, using ideas from [7, Lemma 2], that left cotorsion rings are right
strongly exchange. Recall that R is left cotorsion if Ext1
R(F, R) = 0 for each ﬂat
left R-module F (see e.g. [7]). Let us begin by discussing the relationship between
compatible descending chains of right coprime pairs and certain direct limits.

Let {haα, bαi | α < κ} be a compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs,
and choose families of scalars {rαβ | α < β} and {sαβ | α < β} witnessing the

10

MANUEL CORT´ES-IZURDIAGA AND GUIL ASENSIO

compatibility of the chain. In a similar way as in [7, Lemma 2], we can construct
a direct system of split exact sequences (Σα, (fαβ, gαβ, hαβ) | α < β) in R-Mod,
associated to this descending chain and the families of scalars, as follows. For each
α, Σα is the short exact sequence

0,

where (x)kα = (xaα, xbα) for each x ∈ R, and pα is a cokernel of kα. The fact that
haα, bαi is a right coprime pair is equivalent to Σα being split.

The morphisms fαβ, gαβ and hαβ are deﬁned in the following way:

• fαβ is the identity;
• (x, y)gαβ = (xrαβ , ysαβ);
• hαβ is the unique morphism from Zα to Zβ induced by gαβ.

Note that, as the tensor product commutes with direct limits, the direct limit of

the system of sequences is of the form

with F1 and F2 ﬂat modules.

Theorem 3.6. Let R be a left cotorsion ring. Then R is right strongly exchange.

Proof. Suppose that the result is not true, that is, that R is not right strongly
exchange. Then there exists a compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs,
{haα, bαi | α < κ}, which does not have a minimal lower bound.

For each ordinal α, we are going to construct a right coprime pair hxα, yαi
such that hxα, yαi < hxγ, yγi for each γ < α and the chain {hxγ, yγi | γ ≤ α} is
compatible. This is a contradiction, since it implies that the cardinality of RCP(R)
is bigger than the cardinality of α for any ordinal α.

We will make our construction by transﬁnite induction on all ordinals α.
If
α < κ, set xα = aα and yα = bα. Let us choose now an ordinal α ≥ κ and assume
that we have constructed right coprime pairs hxγ, yγi for each γ < α satisfying the
above condition. Let us distinguish among two possibilities.

Suppose ﬁrst that α is a successor ordinal, say α = β + 1. As hxβ , yβi is not min-
imal, by the election of the initial chain, there exists a right coprime pair hxα, yαi ∈
RCP(R) strictly smaller than hxβ, yβi. Clearly, the chain {hxγ, yγi | γ ≤ α} is
compatible.

Suppose now that α is a limit ordinal. Choose families of scalars, {rαβ | α < β}
and {sαβ | α < β}, witnessing the compatibility of the chain, and consider the
direct system of splitting short exact sequences, (Σγ, (fγβ, gγβ, hγβ) | γ < β < α),
associated to this descending chain. As shown before, the direct limit of the system
is of the form

(2)

0

k

R

F1 ⊕ F2

Z

0

with F1 and F2 ﬂat modules. This sequence is pure, since all the sequences in the
system are split (see e.g. [19, 34.5]). This implies that Z is ﬂat by [19, 36.6]. We
deduce now that this sequence is split, since R is left cotorsion.

Take a splitting k′ of k and denote by fγ : R ⊕ R → F1 ⊕ F2 the canonical map
associated to the direct limit, for each γ < α. Write (1)k = z1 + z2 for some z1 ∈ F1
and z2 ∈ F2 and note that (xγ , 0)fγ = z1 and (0, yγ)fγ = z2 for each γ < α. Denote
by xα = (z1)k′, yα = (z2)k′, rγ = (1, 0)fγk′ and sγ = (0, 1)fγk′ for each γ < α.
Then hxα, yαi is a right coprime pair since

1 = (1)kk′ = (z1 + z2)k′ = xα + yα.

STRONGLY EXCHANGE RINGS

11

Moreover, for each γ < α,

xγrγ = (xγ, 0)fγk′ = xα and yγsγ = (0, yγ)fγk′ = yα.

Finally, if γ < β,

and

rγβrβ = (1, 0)fγβfβk′ = (1, 0)fγk′ = rγ

sγβrβ = (0, 1)fγβfβk′ = (0, 1)fγk′ = sγ.

These identities mean that hxα, yαi is lower bound of the chain and that {hxγ, yγi |
γ ≤ α} is a compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs. Moreover, hxα, yαi <
hxγ, yγi for each γ < α, since the equality hxα, yαi = hxγ, yγi for some γ < α implies
that hxγ, yγi = hxγ+1, yγ+1i, which is a contradiction. This ﬁnishes the construc-
(cid:3)
tion.

Now we prove that local rings are right strongly exchange.

Proposition 3.7. Every local ring is right (and left) strongly exchange.

Proof. Take a compatible descending chain of right coprime pairs, {haα, bαi | α <
κ}. If haα, bαi = h1, 1i for each α < κ, then h1, 0i is trivially a minimal lower bound
of the chain.

So we may assume that there exists an α < κ such that haα, bαi 6= h1, 1i. Since
haα, bαi is a trivial coprime pair by Proposition 2.5, either aα or bα is a unit.
Suppose, without loss of generality, that aα is a unit. Then bα ∈ J(R). We claim
that aβ is a unit for each β < κ. Suppose, on the contrary, that there exists a β < κ
such that aβ is not a unit. Then aβ ∈ J(R). Choosing γ = max{α, β}, we deduce
that aγ ∈ J(R) (since aγ ∈ aβR) and bγ ∈ J(R) (since bγ ∈ bαR). But then,
haγ, bγi cannot be a right coprime pair. A contradiction that proves our claim.

Consequently, aα is a unit for each α < κ and thus, h1, 0i is a minimal lower
(cid:3)

bound of the chain.

Using this result we can show that the class of left cotorsion rings is strictly

contained in the class of right strongly exchange rings.

Example 3.8. Let R be a local Noetherian commutative ring which is not complete
in the I-adic topology. As the completion in the I-adic topology of R is the pure-
injective envelope of R (see e.g.
[8, Example 7.7]), this means that R cannot be
cotorsion by [20, Lemma 3.1.6]. However, R is strongly exchange by Proposition
3.7.

We close this section by showing that the endomorphism ring of a continuous
left R-module is right strongly exchange. Recall that a left R-module M is called
continuous when it satisﬁes the following two conditions (see e.g. [13, 14]):

(C1) Every submodule of M is essential in a direct summand.
(C2) Any submodule of M which is isomorphic to a direct summand of M is

itself a direct summand.

For the rest of this section, let us ﬁx a left R-module M and an injective envelope
u : M → E of M . We will denote by T and S the endomorphism rings of M and E,
respectively. For every f ∈ T , we can use the injectivity of E to ﬁnd an extension
ˆf of f to E, that is, a morphism ˆf : E → E such that u ˆf = f u.

Let f, g ∈ T and take two extensions, ˆf and ˆg, of these morphisms to E. In
general, it may happen that ˆf S ≤ ˆgS but f T (cid:2) gT . Our next lemma shows that
this is not the case when M is continuous and f is idempotent.

Lemma 3.9. Let M be a continuous left R-module and f, e ∈ T with e idempotent.
Take ˆf and ˆe extensions of f and e to E, respectively. If ˆeS ≤ ˆf S, then eT ≤ f T .

12

MANUEL CORT´ES-IZURDIAGA AND GUIL ASENSIO

Proof. There exists, by hypothesis, an h ∈ S such that ˆe = ˆf h. The restriction of
f to Im e is a monomorphism from Im e to M with image Im ef , since if x ∈ M
satisﬁes (x)ef = 0, then 0 = (x)ˆe ˆf h = (x)ˆeˆe = (x)ee = (x)e. We can apply now
(C2) to conclude that Im ef is a direct summand of M .

On the other hand, by condition (C1), we can ﬁnd a direct summand K of M
such that Im(1 − e)f is essential in K. We claim that Im ef ∩ K = 0. Suppose, on
the contrary, that there exists 0 6= y ∈ Im ef ∩ K. Write y = (x)ef for some x ∈ M ,
and note that, as Im(1 − e)f is essential in K, there exist z ∈ M and r ∈ R such
that 0 6= (rx)ef = (z)(1 − e)f . Applying h to this identity we get, on one hand,
that (rx)ef h = (rx)e 6= 0 and, on the other, that (z)(1 − e)f h = (z)(1 − e)e = 0, a
contradiction that proves our claim.

We can now apply (C3) to conclude that Im ef ⊕ K is a direct summand of M .
Thus, there exists a submodule L of M such that Im ef ⊕ K ⊕ L = M . Consider
the endomorphism h′ of M whose restriction to Im ef is equal to h (note that,
Im ef h ≤ M ), and its restriction to K ⊕ L is zero. Then, for each x ∈ M ,

(x)f h′ = ((x)e + (x)(1 − e))f h′ = (x)ef h′ + (x)(1 − e)f h′ = (x)e.

This means that f h′ = e and that eT ≤ f T .

(cid:3)

The following lemma allows us to construct right coprime pairs in S from right

coprime pairs in T .

Lemma 3.10. Let hf, gi be a right coprime pair in T and ˆf and ˆg extensions of f
and g to E, respectively. Then h ˆf , ˆgi is a right coprime pair in S.

Proof. Take r, s ∈ T such that f r + gs = 1M . Then u( ˆf ˆr + ˆgˆs) = u. As u is an
injective envelope, ˆf ˆr + ˆgˆs is an isomorphism and thus, there exists an h ∈ S such
that 1E = ˆf ˆrh + ˆgˆsh. This means that h ˆf , ˆgi is a right coprime pair in S.
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.11. Let M be a continuous left R-module. Then EndR(M ) is right
strongly exchange.

Proof. We follow the notation ﬁxed in p. 11. Take a compatible descending chain
of right coprime pairs in T , {hfα, gαi | α < κ}, and families of elements of T ,
{rαβ | α < β} and {sαβ | α < β}, making the chain compatible. First, we are going
to construct families of endomorphisms of E, {ˆrαβ | α < β} and {ˆsαβ | α < β},
extending the families rαβ and sαβ, respectively, to E, such that

(A) ˆrαγ ˆrγβ = ˆrαβ and
(B) ˆsαγ ˆsγβ = ˆsαβ,

for each α < γ < β. We make the construction of {ˆrαβ | α < β} by transﬁnite
induction on β. The construction of the family {ˆsαβ | α < β} is made similarly.

If β = 0, there is nothing to construct. If β = 1, choose, using the injectivity of

E, an extension ˆr01 : E → E of r01.

Let β < κ, and suppose that we have constructed ˆrαγ for each α < γ < β, and
let us construct ˆrαβ. If β is successor, say β = γ + 1, take ˆrγγ+1 ∈ S an extension
of rγγ+1 and deﬁne ˆrαβ = ˆrαγ ˆrγβ. It is easy to check that ˆrαβ is an extension of
rαβ and that the compatibility conditions (A) hold.

Suppose now that β is a limit ordinal. We have two direct systems of left R-
modules: S1 = (Mα, rαγ | α < γ ∈ β) and S2 = (Eα, ˆrαγ | α < γ ∈ β), where
Mα = M and Eα = E for each α < β. Denote by (X, mα : M → X | α < β) and
(Y, nα : E → Y | α < β) their direct limits. Since each ˆrαγ is an extension of rαγ ,
u deﬁnes a monomorphism between the direct systems S1 and S2, which induces a
monomorphism v : X → Y . Similarly, (rαβ : Mα → M | α < β) is a direct system

STRONGLY EXCHANGE RINGS

13

of morphisms from S1 to M . So, it induces a morphism r : X → M . Finally, using
the injectivity of E we can ﬁnd a ˆr : Y → E making the diagram

commutative. Set now ˆrαβ = nαˆr for each α < β. It is easy to check that ˆrαβ is an
extension of rαβ that satisﬁes the compatibility conditions (A). This ﬁnishes the
construction.

Take now k0 and l0 extensions of f0 and g0 to endomorphisms of E, respectively,

and deﬁne

kα = k0ˆr0α and lα = l0ˆs0α
for every α < κ. Since kα and lα are extensions of fα and gα to E, respectively,
hkα, lαi is a right coprime pair in S by Lemma 3.10. We obtain in this way a
compatible descending chain {hkα, lαi | α < κ} of right coprime pairs in S. Since S
is left pure-injective (in particular, left cotorsion) by [21, Proposition 3], the chain
has a minimal lower bound hk, li by Theorem 3.6. So, there exists an idempotent
e of S such that hk, li = he, 1 − ei by Proposition 2.4. By [13, Theorem 2.8], there
exists an idempotent e′ ∈ T such that e is an extension of e′ to E and, consequently,
1 − e is also an extension of 1 − e′ to E. Since he, 1 − ei ≤ hkα, lαi for each α < κ,
Lemma 3.9 says that he′, 1 − e′i ≤ hfα, gαi for each α < κ. This means that
he′, 1 − e′i is a minimal right coprime pair below the initial chain, which concludes
(cid:3)
the proof.

Corollary 3.12. Suppose that R is a left continuous ring. Then R is a right
strongly exchange ring.

Remark 3.13. The converse of this result is not true. For instance, a commutative
local domain is strongly exchange by Proposition 2.5. But it is not continuous,
unless it is a ﬁeld, since it does not satisfy (C2).

On the other hand, any von Neumann regular left continuous ring which is not
left self-injective (see e.g. [6, Example 13.8]) is another example of a right strongly
exchange ring which is not left cotorsion.

4. Strongly exchange rings. Main properties

We have proved in the previous section that local, left cotorsion and left con-
tinuous rings are right strongly exchange. All these rings are semiregular (see [7,
Theorem 6] and [13, Proposition 3.5]). We are going to show in this section that
right strongly exchange rings are, in general semiregular. Let us begin with a couple
of technical lemmas that we will need later on.

Lemma 4.1. Let ha, bi be a right coprime pair such that aR ∩ bR ≤ J(R). Then
(aR + J(R)) ∩ (bR + J(R)) ≤ J(R).

Proof. Let y ∈ (aR + J(R)) ∩ (bR + J(R)) and take r1, s2 ∈ R, j1, j2 ∈ J(R) such
that y = ar1 + j1 = bs2 + j2.

Since ha, bi is a right coprime pair, there exist s, r ∈ R such that 1 = ar + bs.
Then bsa = a(1 − ra) ∈ aR ∩ bR ≤ J(R) and arb = b(1 − sb) ∈ aR ∩ bR ≤ J(R).
Consequently, (1 − ar)ar1 ∈ J(R).

On the other hand, multiplying the identity ar1 = bs2 + j2 − j1 by ar and using

that arb ∈ J(R), we conclude that arar1 ∈ J(R).

Finally, ar1 = (1 − ar)ar1 + arar1 ∈ J(R), so that y ∈ J(R) as well.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2. Let ha, bi be a right coprime pair.

14

MANUEL CORT´ES-IZURDIAGA AND GUIL ASENSIO

(1) If aR ∩ bR is not contained in J(bR), then there exists a z ∈ R such that

ha, zi is a right coprime pair strictly less than ha, bi.

(2) If aR ∩ bR is not contained in J(R), there exists a right coprime pair hx, yi

strictly less than ha, bi and such that x = a or y = b.

Proof. (1) Choose an x ∈ (aR ∩ bR) \ J(bR). Then xR is not superﬂuous in bR and
there exists a proper submodule X ≤ bR with xR + X = bR. In particular, there
exists a z ∈ X with xR + zR = bR. Then, as x ∈ aR, aR + zR = R, which means
that ha, zi is a coprime pair satisfying ha, zi < ha, bi.

(2) Take x ∈ (aR ∩ bR) \ J(R). We claim that x /∈ J(aR) ∩ J(bR). Suppose,
on the contrary, that x ∈ J(aR) ∩ J(bR) and let X be a right ideal of R such that
xR + X = R. Then, by modularity, aR = xR + (aR ∩ X) and bR = xR + (bR ∩ X),
which implies that aR = aR ∩ X and bR = bR ∩ X, since xR is superﬂuous in aR
and bR. In particular, R = aR + bR ≤ X. This means that xR is superﬂuous in R
and thus, x ∈ J(R). A contradiction which proves our claim.

Therefore, x does not either belong to J(aR) or J(bR). Now, the result follows
(cid:3)

from (1).

Theorem 4.3. Every right strongly exchange ring is semiregular.

Proof. First, we claim that for any right coprime pair ha, bi there exists an element
x such that ha, xi is a right coprime pair, ha, xi ≤ ha, bi and aR ∩ xR ≤ J(xR).

Suppose that our claim is false. We are going to construct by transﬁnite induction

an element bα, for each ordinal α, such that

(a) ha, bαi is a right coprime pair;
(b) aR ∩ bαR is not contained in J(bαR);
(c) ha, bαi < ha, bγi, for each γ < α;
(d) if α > 0 is limit, then bα is idempotent.
For α = 0, set b0 = b.
Let now α > 0 be an ordinal and assume that we have just constructed, for
each γ < α, elements bγ ∈ R satisfying the above conditions. If α is successor,
say α = β + 1, apply Lemma 4.2 to get an element bα such that ha, bαi is a right
coprime pair strictly smaller than ha, bβi. Since we are assuming that our claim is
false, aR ∩ bαR * J(bαR).

Suppose now that α is limit. If the set {γ < α | γ is limit} is not coﬁnal in α,
then there exists a limit ordinal β < α such that α = β + ω. Then the descending
chain of right coprime pairs, {ha, bβ+ni | n < ω}, is compatible and, by hypothesis,
it has a minimal lower bound hx, bαi. By Proposition 2.4, bα can be chosen to
be idempotent. Since xR ≤ aR, ha, bαi is a right coprime pair below the chain.
Moreover, ha, bαi < ha, bγi for each γ < α, since the identity ha, bαi = ha, bγi for
some γ < α, implies that ha, bγi = ha, bγ+1i, a contradiction. Finally, aR ∩ bαR is
not contained in J(bαR) since we are supposing that our initial claim is false.

If
It remains to prove the case in which {γ < α | γ is limit} is coﬁnal in α.
this holds, we have the descending chain of right coprime pairs {ha, bγi | γ <
α limit}. The arguments used in the proof of Proposition 3.2 show that this chain
is compatible. So we can ﬁnd by hypothesis a minimal lower bound hx, bαi, in
which bα idempotent by Proposition 3.2. Reasoning as above, we get that ha, bαi is
a right coprime pair below the chain such that aR ∩ bαR * J(bαR). This ﬁnishes
the construction.

We have constructed, for any ordinal α, a right coprime pair ha, bαi such that
ha, bαi < ha, bβi if α < β. In particular, this means that bα 6= bβ if α < β and
therefore, the cardinality of R must be at least the cardinality of α for any ordinal
α. A contradiction that proves our initial claim.

STRONGLY EXCHANGE RINGS

15

Finally, given any a ∈ R, we can apply our claim to the right coprime pair
ha, 1 − ai to get an element x ∈ R such that ha, xi is a right coprime pair with
aR ∩ xR ≤ J(xR) and ha, xi ≤ ha, 1 − ai. By Lemma 4.1,

(a + J(R))R/J(R)

(x + J(R))R/J(R) = R/J(R)

which means that (a + J(R))R/J(R) is a direct summand of R/J(R). This proves
that R/J(R) is a von Neumann regular ring.

M

In order to prove that idempotents lift modulo the Jacobson radical of R, note
that R is an exchange ring and that exchange rings have this property [15, Theorem
(cid:3)
2.1 and Proposition 1.5].

The converse of this result is not true, since there exist von Neumann regular

rings which are not right strongly exchange (see Example 3.5).

Remark 4.4. We have proved in Section 3 that local, left self-injective, left pure-
injective, left cotorsion and left continuous rings are right strongly exchange. All
these rings satisfy that they are left continuous modulo their Jacobson radical (see
[7, Theorem 8] and [13, Theorem 3.11]). But we do not know whether any right
strongly exchange rings enjoys this property.

If we strengthen the deﬁnition of right strongly exchange ring a little bit to include
all compatible descending systems of right coprime pairs instead of just compatible
descending chains of right coprime pairs, we can prove that the ring is left con-
tinuous modulo its Jacobson radical. However, we do not know whether any left
continuous ring satisﬁes this last condition.

Let us state the ideas of the preceding remark more precisely.

Deﬁnition 4.5. Let R be a ring.

(1) A descending system of right coprime pairs is a downwards directed subset
of RCP(R). I.e., a subset {pi | i ∈ I} ⊆ RCP(R) indexed by a directed set
I such that pj ≤ pi whenever i ≤ j.

(2) A descending system of right coprime pairs {pi | i ∈ I} is called compatible
if for each i ∈ I, there exists a pair of generators (ai, bi) of pi, and families
of scalars {rij | i < j} and {sij | i < j}, satisfying that
(a) aj = airij and bj = bisij ;
(b) rik = rij rjk and sik = sij sjk.

for each i < j < k in I.

As in the case of chains, if {hai, bii | i ∈ I} is a compatible descending system of
right coprime pairs, we will assume that (ai, bi) is the pair of generators satisfying
the compatibility condition of the preceding deﬁnition.

Recall that the singular submodule of a right R-module M is its submodule

Z(M ) = {x ∈ M | rR(x) is essential in RR}.

A module M is called singular if M = Z(M ) and non-singular if Z(M ) = 0.

Lemma 4.6. Let M be a non-singular module and K, N and L, submodules of M
such that both inclusions K ≤ N and K ≤ L are essential. If M
L is non-singular
(for instance, if L is a direct summand of M ), then N ≤ L.

Proof. Since K ≤ N ∩ L ≤ N , we get that N ∩ L is essential in N . And, by [5,
Proposition 1.21], N
L is non-singular,
since it is a submodule of the non-singular module M
N ∩L = 0 and,
(cid:3)
consequently, N ≤ L.

N ∩L is singular. On the other hand, N

Proof. Denote R/J(R) by R. For every x ∈ R, let x be the corresponding element
in R/J(R). And, for each subset X of R, denote by X the subset {x | x ∈ X} ⊆ R.
Let I be a left ideal of R. Using Lemma 4.8, and the fact that R is semiregular
by Theorem 4.3, we can ﬁnd sets of idempotents of R, E and F , such that {Re |
e∈E Re +
e ∈ E} ∪ {Rf | f ∈ F } is independent,
f∈F Rf is essential in R. We may apply now [21, Lemma 13] to conclude that

{Re | e ∈ E}∪{Rf | f ∈ E} is a local direct summand of RR. I.e., it is independent

and for every ﬁnite subset X ⊆ E ∪ F ,

e∈E Re is essential in I and

e∈X Re is a direct summand of R.

Similarly, ﬁx and idempotent fY for each ﬁnite subset Y of F . Then, for every

that h1 − eX , 1 − fY i is a right coprime pair by [21, Lemma 12]. It is easy to check
that the family

P

{h1 − eX , 1 − fY i | X ⊆ E, Y ⊆ E are ﬁnite subsets}

is a compatible descending system of right coprime pairs.

Now, we may apply our hypothesis to ﬁnd a minimal lower bound ha, bi of the
system which, by Proposition 2.4, must be of the form hg, 1−gi, for some idempotent
element g. Then, g ∈ (1 − eX )R and 1 − g ∈ (1 − fY )R for each X ⊆ E and Y ⊆ F
ﬁnite, which implies that eX ∈ R(1 − g) and fY ∈ Rg. In particular, e ∈ R(1 − g)

e∈E Re is essential in R(1 − g). Finally, I is

We have just proved that R satisﬁes (C1). Since R is von Neumann regular by
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.3, it trivially satisﬁes (C2). Therefore, R is left continuous.

We use some ideas in the proof of the preceding result to show that the strong

exchange property is not left-right symmetric.

Example 4.10. Let D be a division ring and V a vector space over D with inﬁnite
countable dimension. Denote by S the endomorphism ring of V . Then S is left
strongly exchange but not right strongly exchange.

Proof. It is well known, e. g. [5, Proposition 2.23], that S is right self-injective. By
Theorem 3.6, S is left strongly exchange.

Let {vn | n < ω} be a basis of V and denote by en : V → V the endomor-
phism of V satisfying en(vi) = 0 if i 6= n and en(vn) = vn, for each n < ω.
Moreover, let p : V → V be the endomorphism of V such that p(ei) = e0 for
∩
each i < ω. As it is shown in the proof of [5, Propostion 2.23],
Sp = 0, which in particular implies, as a consequence of Proposition 2.3, that
n≤m en, 1 − pi is a right coprime pair in S for each m < ω. Then, it is easy

Now we claim that {(1 − e)(vn) | n < ω} is linearly independent. Assume, in

Finally, this claim implies that 1 − e is monic and, since it is idempotent, e = 0.
But 1 = 1 − e ∈ S(1 − p), which implies that p = 0 as well. This is a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Now we give a suﬃcient condition for a strongly exchange ring to be semiperfect.

Theorem 4.11. Suppose that R is a right strongly exchange ring with countably
many idempotents. Then R is semiperfect.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst note that R is semiregular by Theorem 4.3 and that R/J(R) has
countably many idempotents. Suppose that R is not semiperfect. Then R/J(R)
is not semisimple and thus, it has inﬁnite right Goldie dimension. This means
that there exists a countable inﬁnite family {en | n < ω} of non-zero idempotents
in R such that the family {(en + J(R))R/J(R) | n < ω} is independent. By [6,
Proposition 2.14], we may assume that the family {en+J(R) | n < ω} is orthogonal.
For each inﬁnite subset A ⊂ ω such that ω \ A is inﬁnite, write A = {in(A) | n <

ω} and ω \ A = {jn(A) | n < ω}. Deﬁne the idempotents

for any n < ω. We get a descending chain of right coprime pairs, {hxA
n i | n < ω},
for which we can ﬁnd, by hypothesis, a lower bound hxA, yAi. Since R/J(R) is von
Neumann regular, we can assume that xA and yA are idempotent elements.

n , yA

We claim that if A and B are distinct subsets of ω such that ω \ A and ω \ B
are inﬁnite, then xA 6= xB. This will prove the result, since this would imply that
the set of idempotents of R is uncountable.

To prove our claim, choose an n ∈ A \ B. Then n ∈ ω \ B and thus, there exist
u, v < ω such that n = iu(A) and n = jv(B). Using that xA ∈ xA
u R/J(R) and
(en + J(R))xA
u = 0, we get that (en + J(R))xA = 0. Similarly, (en + J(R))yB = 0,
v = 0. Now, writing 1 + J(R) = xBr + yBs
since yB ∈ yB
v R/J(R) and (en + J(R))yB
for r, s ∈ R, we get that en + J(R) = (en + J(R))xBr, from which we deduce that
(cid:3)
(en + J(R))xB 6= 0. As (en + J(R))xA = 0, we conclude that xA 6= xB.

Corollary 4.12. Any right strongly exchange ring with countably many idempotent
elements and zero Jacobson radical is semisimple. In particular, any regular left
continuous ring with countably many idempotents is semisimple.

Proof. R is semiperfect by the above theorem. So it is semisimple as its Jacobson
radical is zero. Finally, note that, if R is a left continuous von Neumann regular
(cid:3)
ring, then it satisﬁes these conditions by Theorem 3.11.

Remark 4.13. The following alternative proof of the last assertion of this corollary
was communicated to us by K. Goodearl. Suppose that R is a left continuous ring
which is not semisimple. Then, by [6, Corollary 2.16], R has an inﬁnite set of non-
zero orthogonal idempotents, {en | n < ω}. Let Q be the maximal left quotient ring
of R. Since Q is left self-injective, for every subset J of ω, there exists an idempotent
eJ of Q such that QeJ is an injective hull of
j∈J Qej. The set {eJ | J ⊆ ω} is
uncountable, which is a contradiction, since R contains all the idempotent elements
of Q by [6, Theorem 13.13].

We close this paper by suggesting some new lines of research. As we mentioned
in the introduction, it is not known whether a module M satisfying the ﬁnite
exchange property does satisfy the full exchange property. On the other hand,
Warﬁeld proved that a module M satisﬁes the ﬁnite exchange property if and only
if its endomorphism ring is exchange. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether a
module M satisﬁes the full exchange property provided its endomorphism ring
is right strongly exchange. Let us call a module M strongly exchange when its
endomorphism ring is right strongly exchange. The above question can rephrased
as follows:

Question 4.14. Does every strongly exchange module satisfy the full exchange
property?

A ring R is called clean when every element in R is the sum of an idempotent
and a unit. Suppose that R satisﬁes that compatible descending systems of right
coprime pairs have minimal lower bounds. Then, by Theorems 4.3 and 4.9, R is
semiregular and R/J(R) is left continuous. By [2, Theorem 3.9], R/J(R) is clean
and by [3, Proposition 7] R is clean as well. Moreover, note that all the examples
of right strongly exchange rings exhibited in this paper are clean (for instance, left
self injective, left cotorsion, local or left continuous rings). We may pose then the
following question:

Question 4.15. Is every right strongly exchange ring clean?
