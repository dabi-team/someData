ANTI-CLASSIFICATION RESULTS FOR GROUPS ACTING
FREELY ON THE LINE

FILIPPO CALDERONI, DAVID MARKER, LUCA MOTTO ROS, AND ASSAF SHANI

Abstract. We explore countable ordered Archimedean groups from the point
of view of descriptive set theory. We introduce the space of Archimedean left-
orderings Ar(G) for a given countable group G, and prove that the equiva-
lence relation induced by the natural action of GL2(Q) on Ar(Q2) is not con-
cretely classiﬁable. Then we analyze the isomorphism relation for countable
ordered Archimedean groups, and pin its complexity in terms of the hierar-
chy of Hjorth, Kechris and Louveau [HKL98].
In particular, we show that
its potential class is not Π0
3. This topological constraint prevents classifying
Archimedean groups using countable subsets of reals. We obtain analogous
results for the bi-embeddability relation, and we consider similar problems for
circularly ordered groups, and o-minimal structures such as ordered divisible
Abelian groups, and real closed ﬁelds. Our proofs combine classical results on
Archimedean groups, the theory of Borel equivalence relations, and analyzing
deﬁnable sets in the basic Cohen model and other models of Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory without choice.

1. Introduction

A group G is left-orderable if it admits a strict total order that is invariant
under left multiplication. If G is a countable left-orderable group, it is not hard to
produce a faithful action of G on the real line by order preserving homeomorphism
associated to any left-ordering on G. This action is called dynamical realization.

Turning orders into actions gives rise to a beautiful interplay between algebraic
properties and dynamical structure. This correspondence dates back as early as
the work by Hölder in 1901, when he proved that any group acting freely on R is
Abelian. (See Ghys [Ghy01, Theorem 6.10].) Besides its classical relevance, the
dynamical approach has been proven useful in numerous situations. For example,
in the context of the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, orderability has crucial
implications in the theory of foliations and laminations as showed by Calegari and
Dunﬁeld [CD03]. More recently, Mann and Rivas [MR18] established a character-
ization of certain left-orders in terms of rigidity phenomena in the moduli space
Hom(G, Homeo+(R)).

Hölder was particularly interested in left-ordered groups having the Archimedean
G

type property. Recall that an ordered group (G, <) is Archimedean if for all x, y

of their dynamical realizations: Archimedean orders correspond to free actions on

Section 3].)

In this paper we study Archimedean ordered groups from the point of view of
descriptive set theory. Mainly, we analyze the possibility of classifying countable
Archimedean groups completely up to isomorphism.

To explain our approach we shall present brieﬂy the main ideas behind Borel clas-

In many well-understood situations we can parametrize the elements of
objects of a standard Borel space1 and we can regard ∼=
as a Borel set. More
precisely, we say that an equivalence relation on a standard Borel space X is Borel
if it is a Borel subset of the product space X
X. As explained in the excellent
survey of Foreman [For18], for those equivalence relations that are Borel, we can
determine whether two elements are equivalent with a countable amount of data.
On the other hand, when we prove that a certain equivalence relation is not Borel,
we can take it as strong evidence against a satisfactory classiﬁcation theory.

The “non-Borel test” produced anticlassiﬁcation results in many notable situa-
tions such as [Hjo02, DM08] for the isomorphism relation on torsion-free Abelian
groups, and in [FRW11] for the isomorphism relation on the space of measure pre-
serving transformation of the unit interval. However, the isomorphism relation on
countable Archimedean groups is easily seen to be Borel (see Section 3), and this
leaves a door open to ﬁnd optimal complete invariants.

The standard notion for comparing the complexity of diﬀerent equivalence rela-
tion is Borel reducibility. If E, F are equivalence relations on the standard Borel
spaces X and Y respectively, we say that E is Borel reducible to F (in symbols,
f (x1) F f (x2).

Whenever E
B F , then F -classes can be regarded as complete invariants for
E. Moreover, any deﬁnable complete classiﬁcation for F translates into a deﬁn-
able complete classiﬁcation for E. The notion of Borel reducibility has been used
successfully to analyze invariants for several classiﬁcation problems across mathe-
matics. Some remarkable examples are included in [AK00, FW04, Sab16, Tho03].

As a consequence of a classical dichotomy by Silver [Sil80] the collection of Borel
equivalence relations with uncountably many classes has a minimum element, the
identity relation on real numbers, denoted by =R. A Borel equivalence relation is
called concretely classiﬁable (or smooth) if it is Borel reducible to =R. Moreover,
Harrington, Kechris and Louveau [HKL90] showed that the equivalence relation of
eventual equality E0 on 2N, the Cantor space of binary sequences equipped with
the product topology, is an immediate successor of =R.

We observe in Section 2 that the isomorphism relation ∼=ArGp on countable or-
dered Archimedean groups is not Borel reducible to =R. In fact, let ∼=Ar(Q2) be the

order preserving isomorphism relation on the space of isomorphic copies of Q2 with
all possible Archimedean orders.

Theorem 1.1 (Section 2). There is a Borel reduction from E0 to ∼=Ar (Q2).
particular, ∼=Ar(Q2) is not concretely classiﬁable.

In

This is an anti-classiﬁcation theorem in the sense that it excludes the possibility
of classifying countable Archimedean groups completely using numerical invariants,
and it is also a contribution to the analysis and classiﬁcation of the left-orders on a
given countable group [CC, Cla12, Lin11, Riv12, Sik04]. (In Section 2 we will point
out that Baer’s analysis [Bae37] of torsion-free Abelian group of rank 1 also implies
that isomorphism on countable Archimedean groups is strictly more complicated
than =R.)

Beyond concrete classiﬁcation, one can try to assign invariants which are count-
able sets of reals. For example, using the Halmos-von Neumann theory, Foreman
and Louveau showed that countable sets of reals provide a successful classiﬁcation
of the conjugacy relation on ergodic discrete spectrum transformations (see [For00,
Section 5.2]).

A natural way to capture this is by comparing our equivalence relation with
the Friedman-Stanley jumps, deﬁned as follows [FS89]. The ﬁrst Friedman-Stanley
jump is the equivalence relation =+
R deﬁned on the space RN by identifying two
countable sequences of reals if and only if they enumerate the same set of reals.
The equivalence relation =+
R admits the natural complete classiﬁcation sending
, so that the invariants
(xn)n
are precisely the countable sets of reals. A Borel equivalence relation E is considered
classiﬁable by countable sets of reals if it is Borel reducible to =+
R .

The second Friedman-Stanley jump =++

is deﬁned to naturally admit complete

invariants which are countable sets of countable sets of reals. Similarly, for each
countable ordinal α, Friedman and Stanley deﬁned an equivalence relation =α+

This Friedman-Stanley hierarchy was further reﬁned by Hjorth, Kechris and Lou-
veau [HKL98], where they introduced equivalence relations ∼=∗α+2,β whose complex-
and =(α+1)+

R
relations ∼=∗3,0 and ∼=∗3,1 such that

Moreover, it turns out [HKL98] that there is a clear correspondence between the
topological complexity of isomorphism relations and their possible invariants. For
example, for any isomorphism relation E, if E is Π0
3 then it is Borel reducible to
R , and if E is Σ0
=+
4 then it is Borel reducible to ∼=∗3,1.
We show that =+
R is Borel reducible to ∼=ArGp (Proposition 3.5), and that ∼=ArGp is
4, and therefore is Borel reducible to ∼=∗3,1 (Proposition 3.12). Next, in Section 4
R in a very strong sense:

Σ0
we show that ∼=ArGp is genuinely more complicated than =+
Theorem 1.2 (Section 4). The isomorphism relation ∼=ArGp is not Borel reducible
to ∼=∗3,0. Consequently, countable sets of reals cannot be used to completely classify
countable Archimedean groups up to isomorphism.

Combining all previous results we get

R <B ∼=ArGp <B =++
=+
R .
This is a curious phenomenon also from the viewpoint of the theory of Borel re-
ducibility. To the best of our knowledge it is the ﬁrst example of a natural isomor-
phism relation lying strictly in between two consecutive Friedman-Stanley jumps
of =R.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 goes through the study of deﬁnable sets in models
of ZF, the standard axioms of mathematics without the axiom of choice, and the
technique of forcing, which was developed by Cohen in 1963 to solve the long-
standing Hilbert’s ﬁrst problem, also known as the Continuum Hypothesis. More
speciﬁcally, working in a forcing extension of the so called “basic Cohen model”, we
construct a generic invariant for Archimedean groups which is complex enough so
that it cannot be coded by any invariant for ∼=∗3,0. This is a striking application of
the techniques recently developed by Shani [Sha].

Our arguments are rather ﬂexible and can also be used to attack similar problems
concerning the (bi-)embeddability relation on countable Archimedean groups using
the natural generalization of Borel reducibility to quasi-orders.

In Section 6 we analyze the isomorphism relation on the class of circularly ordered
Archimedean groups. These are the algebraic counterparts of groups acting freely
on the circle. Circularly ordered groups have been recently investigated in a series
of work including [BS18, BCG, CMR18, CG19], and they play a central role in the
aforementioned work of Calegari and Dunﬁeld [CD03]. We contrast Theorem 1.2
by showing the following:
Theorem 1.4 (Section 6). The isomorphism and bi-embeddability relations ∼=CArGp
and
CArGp on Archimedean circularly ordered groups are Borel bi-reducible with

tween ordered groups after removing the Archimedean type property, and other
ordered structures. In particular we show:

Theorem 1.5 (Section 7). The embeddability relation on countable ordered divis-
ible Abelian groups is a complete analytic quasi-order. Thus, the bi-embeddability

5

relation on countable ordered divisible Archimedean groups is a complete analytic
equivalence relation.

This particularly implies that embeddability on countable real closed ﬁelds is a
complete analytic quasi-order, and that the corresponding bi-embeddability relation
is a complete analytic equivalence relation. Theorem 1.5 and the other results of
Section 7 extend the work of Rast and Sahota [RSS17] about the isomorphism
relation for ﬁrst order o-minimal theories.

2. Preliminary results

A group G is left-orderable if it admits a strict total order < such that y < z
implies xy < xz for all x, y, z
G. A countable group G is left-orderable if and
only if it admits a faithful action on R by order preserving homeomorphisms. (E.g.,
see [Nav10, Proposition 2.1]). Note that this characterization fails after dropping
countability, since Mann [Man15] proved that the group of germs at inﬁnity of
orientation preserving homeomorphisms of R admits no nontrivial action on the
real line.

∈

An order preserving homomorphism between left-ordered groups is a group ho-
In particular, every order preserving
momorphism that preserves their orders.
homomorphism is automatically an embedding because of the anti-reﬂexivity and
linearity of strict orders. Throughout this paper, when we talk about ordered
groups, we simply say “isomorphism” instead of “order preserving isomorphism”
whenever it is clear from the context.

Recall that an ordered group is Archimedean if for every g, h

Z
such that g < hn. Archimedean left-ordered groups appeared as early as the work
of Stolz [Sto91] going back to 1891. Soon thereafter Hölder proved the following:

Theorem 2.1 (Hölder [Hol01]). Every Archimedean left-ordered group is order
isomorphic to a subgroup of (R, +) equipped with the natural ordering on R.

An immediate consequence is that the Archimedean type property implies com-
mutativity. Henceforth, we shall say “Archimedean order” instead of “Archimedean
left-order”, and we shall use exclusively the additive notation for Archimedean (or-
dered) groups. Using Theorem 2.1 one can also characterize Archimedian groups
as those ordered groups whose dynamical realization is a free action on R by orien-
tation preserving homeomorphisms. For more details on the dynamical realization
of Archimedean orders see [Nav10, Section 3.1]. Another consequence of Hölder’s
theorem is the following classical lemma.

Ar(Qn). Then we can focus only on the spaces Ar(Qn).

Teh’s work yields the existence of continuum many diﬀerent Archimedean orders
on Qn, for n > 1. Thus, it is very natural to ask in how many non-isomorphic way
we can equip Qn with an Archimedean order, and whether we can classify them in
a concrete way (i.e., using real numbers as complete invariants).

In the remainder of this section we prove Theorem 1.1, which particularly implies
that ∼=Ar(Q2) is not concretely classiﬁable. First, we brieﬂy introduce some notions
that are fundamental to the theory of countable Borel equivalence relations.

Let E and F be equivalence relations on X and Y , respectively. A map f : X

A consequence of the fact that E0 is generically ergodic is that there is no

isomorphism. In fact, it shows that the Borel cardinality of Ar(Q2) modulo the
isomorphism relation is strictly bigger than the one of R modulo identity. That is,
there is no injection from Ar(Q2)/∼=Ar Q2 into R admitting a Borel lifting.

Another way of rephrasing Theorem 1.1 is saying that the quotient Borel space
Ar(Q2)/GL2(Q) is not standard. The quotient structures of spaces of left-orderings
has been already investigated by Calderoni and Clay [CC], who proved that the
quotient Borel space LO(G)/ Inn(G) is not standard for a large class of groups

2.2. Archimedean groups of rank 1. In this short subsection we show that also
Baer’s analysis of torsion-free Abelian groups of rank 1 shows that we cannot use
numerical invariant to classify completely ∼=ArGp.

It is well-known that an Abelian group is torsion-free of rank 1 if and only if it is
a subgroup of Q, and the same remains true if we move to rank 1 ordered Abelian
groups and equip Q with its natural order. Let S(Q) be the set of subgroups of Q.
It is easily checked that S(Q) is a Gδ subset of 2Q, thus a Polish space. All elements
of S(Q) will be regarded as ordered groups with the obvious ordering. Let ∼=S(Q)

Louveau hierarchy is strict. For example, ∼=∗n,k <B ∼=∗n,k+1, whenever deﬁned.

Next, we brieﬂy recall the theory of potential complexity.

Deﬁnition 3.10 (Louveau [Lou94]). Let Γ be a class of sets in Polish spaces that
is closed under continuous preimages. Suppose that E is an equivalence relation on
a standard Borel space X. We say that E is potentially in Γ if there exists a Polish
topology τ on X generating its Borel structure such that E is in Γ in the product
space (X

X, τ 2).

×

By a standard change of topology argument (see e.g. [Kec95, Section 13]), E is
potentially in Γ if and only if there is a Polish space Y and an equivalence relation
F on Y such that F is in Γ (as a subset of Y 2) and E

B F .

Hjorth, Kechris, and Louveau [HKL98] completely classiﬁed the possible point-
classes Γ which can be realized as the optimal potential complexity of an isomor-
phism relation. More precisely, we say that Γ is the potential complexity of E if E is
potentially Γ but E is not potentially ˜Γ, where ˜Γ is the class of complements of sets

no explicit proof of such result appeared in the literature, we include it here for

is Π0
R by Proposition 3.11. Indeed, any isomorphism
between two elements of X ∗ArGp must match their distinguished elements, and from
them we can recover the scalar determining the isomorphism as in Hion’s lemma.
Thus in equation (

classiﬁcation using hereditarily countable sets of sets of reals (or, even more pre-
cisely, elements of

to produce them. Below we explain how to explicitly compute such complete in-

The proof uses methods from set theory, such as forcing over choiceless models of
ZF set theory. We start by providing context with an informal overview of our
strategy.

The technique we are going to describe was introduced by Shani [Sha]. Let V be
the model of ZFC we are working in. Suppose that E and F are Borel equivalence
relations on standard Borel spaces X and Y . Suppose further that we have a
“reasonable” assignment of complete invariants x
By for E and F ,
respectively. Here “reasonable” means that

classiﬁcation of E, and V and M compute (using φ) the invariant Ax in
the same way for every x

X which belongs to V .

We call such complete assignments of invariants absolute classiﬁcations by heredi-
tarily countable sets. Examples of such classiﬁcations that are relevant to this paper

4.1. Background. For the rest of Section 4 we assume a certain familiarity with
set theory and, in particular, with the basics of the forcing technique. We begin with
some speciﬁc background material that we will use, referring the reader to [Jec03]
for more on the subject.

Throughout this section V denotes a model of ZFC. Suppose A is a set in some
generic extension of V . Then there exists a minimal transitive model of ZF contain-
ing V and A, denoted by V (A). All assertions below regarding Borel reductions are
absolute. Therefore it suﬃces to consider V = L, Gödel’s constructible universe; in
this case V (A) is the usual Hajnal relativized L-construction, L(A). (Often times,
as will be the case here, the axiom of choice fails in V (A).)

Working in V (A), we can consider the submodel of all sets which are hereditarily
deﬁnable using A and parameters from V . This is again an extension of V which
is a model of ZF and contains A, and therefore is equal to V (A) by minimality.

Fact 4.1. The following holds in V (A). For any set X, there is some formula
ψ, parameters ¯a from the transitive closure of A and v
V such that X is the
unique set satisfying ψ(X, A, ¯a, v). Equivalently, there is a formula ϕ such that
X =

. In this case we say that ¯a is a deﬁnable support for X.

We will be particularly interested in sets with empty deﬁnable support, that is,

those deﬁnable from A and parameters in V alone.

As discussed above, a key ingredient of our technique is the following:

Theorem 4.2 (Shani [Sha, Lemma 3.6]). Suppose that E and F are Borel equiv-
Ax and
alence relations on standard Borel spaces X and Y , respectively, and x
By are absolute classiﬁcations by hereditarily countable sets. Assume further
y
that f : X
Y is a Borel reduction of E to F . Let x be an element of X in some
generic extension of V , and let A = Ax and B = Bf (x). Then V (A) = V (B), and
B is deﬁnable in V (A) from A and parameters in V alone.

7→

7→

→

Specializing the above theorem to our situation we get the following result.

Corollary 4.3. Suppose E is a Borel equivalence relation on a standard Borel
Ax is an absolute classiﬁcation of E by hereditarily countable
space X, and x
sets. Let x be an element of X in some generic extension of V , and set A = Ax.

Sketch of the proof. Part (1) follows immediately from Theorem 4.2, as =+
R admits
an absolute classiﬁcation by hereditarily countable sets with sets of reals as complete
invariants.

Part (2) is [Sha, Claim 6.4]. The point is that an invariant for ∼=∗3,0 is a pair (D, R)
where D is a set of sets of reals, and R codes enumerations of D (see Remark 3.7).

Remark 4.4. Readers unfamiliar with the expression “x is an element of X in
some generic extension on V ” may concentrate on the unique speciﬁc situations
considered in this paper, namely, when X is the standard Borel space of countable
Archimedean groups, and E is either order isomorphism or bi-embeddability on X.
Then the above condition on x appearing in both Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3
reads as follows: “Let x be a countable Archimedean group in some generic extension
of V .”

4.2. The basic Cohen model. In this subsection we present some standard re-
sults about the basic Cohen models that we will use later. This model is one of the
ﬁrst examples presented by Paul Cohen for the independence of the axiom of choice
from the axioms of ZF, that is, a model of ZF set theory in which the axiom of choice
fails (see [Kan08]). For the reader’s convenience, we include here self-contained full
proofs of such results. Our presentation is slightly diﬀerent from what can be found
in the standard literature [Fel71, Jec73, Jec03] and is more close to the “deﬁnability
arguments” that we will use later. Readers familiar with these concepts may safely
skip this section.

Fact 4.5. A1 is dense in R.

In particular, A1 is inﬁnite. Recall the following deﬁnition:

Equivalently, there are no inﬁnite sequences in X.

Below we show that A1 is Dedekind-ﬁnite in V (A1). The key idea is that the reals
in A1 are “suﬃciently indiscernibles” over the ground model V . This is captured
by the following.

Work over the “basic Cohen model” V (A1). If we take our group G to be K =

the invariant AH consists of a set of pairwise disjoint sets of reals. Since any set of
pairwise disjoint sets of reals can be deﬁnably coded as a single set of reals (e.g.,
see [Sha, Proposition 5.1]), the invariant AH is again as simple as a set of reals.

Instead, we shall add via forcing a generic group G between H and K. In our
argument it will be crucial to add such G by a forcing with enough automorphisms
that change G while preserving the invariant AG.
It will also be important to
have such automorphisms densely, that is, given a condition p compatible with
the generic group G, we want to have an automorphism, sending G to G′, which
preserves the invariant AG′ = AG and such that p is compatible with G′ as well.

generically as possible from the ﬁeld K.

It will also be important to add the group G, generically over V (A1), without
adding any real. This will ensure that sets of reals will be subsets of the ground
model V (A1), and therefore easier to analyze. However, if we add G as a “generic

It follows from Lemma 4.12 that P adds no new members to any Polish space,
as such members can be coded as subsets of V. For example, no new members of
R or RN are added.
Remark 4.13. In particular P adds no sets of ordinals over V (A1). This phe-
nomenon can only happen when forcing over models in which the axiom of choice
fails. An extension of the basic Cohen model which adds no sets of ordinals was
ﬁrst constructed in [Jec71]. Higher rank analogues were established in [Mon73],
[Kar18], [Kar19] and [Sha]. Extensions adding no sets of ordinals to L(R) were
studied in [HMW85] and [DH].

Corollary 4.18. ∼=ArGp
Remark 4.19. Technically speaking, Corollary 4.3 should be applied in a further
generic extension of V (A) = V (A1)[F ] where we add a countable enumeration ~xG
of G by forcing with ﬁnite conditions. This is because then A = AG = A~xG properly
becomes an invariant of ∼=ArGp according to Section 3.3. Notice that Lemma 4.17
still holds in such generic extension because it just refers to assertions concerning
V (A), which is not aﬀected by the further forcing. Similar considerations apply to
the proof of Theorem 1.2 below and to the proof of Proposition 5.8.

We now move to the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. By the contrapositive of Corollary 4.3(2), it is enough to
prove that V (A)
V (A) is a set of sets of reals deﬁnable from
A and parameters in V alone such that B is countable in V (A).

are ﬁnitely many members of B, ¯x = x1, ..., xl are ﬁnitely many reals in the tran-
sitive closure of B, and v
V . Fix a condition p = (Sp, Gp) in the generic forcing
the above. Note that ¯x is in the ground model V (A1) by Lemma 4.12.

∈

∈

∈

By Corollary 4.15 there are inﬁnitely many d

G such that the generic G/d =
δd(G) extends p. Since p forces that ˙G is deﬁned in V (A) as the unique solution to
φ(G, ˙¯U, ˇ¯x, v) it follows that there is some ¯Ud from B such that G/d is the unique
solution in V (A) to φ(G/d, ¯Ud, ¯x, v). (This follows from similar arguments as in
Lemma 4.17. Note that G and G/d calculate the same A and so the same B.)

Working in V (A), B is countable and so is Bk. Let ¯Ui, i < ω be an enumeration
of the elements ˜¯U in Bk for which there exists d
A1 such that G/d is deﬁned by
∈
φ(G/d, ˜¯U, ¯x, v). For any i < ω, let di be the unique d
A1 such that φ(G/d, ¯Ui, ¯x, v)
is a real, and there-
holds (uniqueness follows from Lemma 4.16). Then

Rosendal’s jump is the asymmetric version of the Friedman-Stanley. In fact, if E

Starting with =R, we can deﬁne a hierarchy of Borel quasi-orders =α-cf

R , α < ω1,
by applying Rosendal’s jump at successor stages and the usual countable product at
limit stages. For example, the quasi-order =cf
R is the ﬁrst element in the hierarchy
after =R and is basically the inclusion relation between countable sets of reals, so
that the canonical equivalence relation associated to it is exactly =+

By [Ros05, Proposition 6 and Corollary 15], the mentioned hierarchy is strict (that

nonsimple types in the proof of Vaught’s Conjecture for o-minimal theories. Fur-
ther, Rast and Sahota [RSS17] showed that for every o-minimal theory admitting
nonsimple types the isomorphism relation ∼=T on the space of countable models of

T is S
on a standard Borel space (equivalently: every isomorphism relation) is Borel

reducible to ∼=T , and thus the latter is as complicated as possible. This is proved
by showing that under such hypothesis on T , the relation ∼=LO of isomorphism on

countable linear orders, which is a well known example of an S
lence relation, is Borel reducible to ∼=T .

An important example of an o-minimal theory admitting nonsimple types is the
