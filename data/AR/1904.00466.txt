ABSTRACT

We explore the possible effect of cluster environments on the structure and star formation
histories of galaxies by analysing the projected phase–space (PPS) of intermediate-redshift
clusters (0.4 (cid:54) z (cid:54) 0.8). HST I−band imaging data from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey
(EDisCS) allow us to measure deviations of the galaxies’ light distributions from symmetric
and smooth proﬁles using two parameters, Ares (‘asymmetry’) and RF F (residual ﬂux frac-
tion or ‘roughness’). Combining these structural parameters with age-sensitive spectral indi-
cators (HδA, HγA and Dn4000), we establish that in all environments younger star-forming
galaxies of all morphologies are ‘rougher’ and more asymmetric than older, more quiescent
ones. Combining a subset of the EDisCS clusters we construct a stacked PPS diagram and ﬁnd
a signiﬁcant correlation between the position of the galaxies on the PPS and their stellar ages,
irrespective of their morphology. We also observe an increasing fraction of galaxies with older
stellar populations towards the cluster core, while the galaxies structural parameters (Ares and
RF F ) do not seem to segregate strongly with PPS. These results may imply that, under the
possible inﬂuence of their immediate cluster environment, galaxies have their star formation
suppressed earlier, while their structural transformation happens on a longer timescale as they
accumulate and age in the cluster cores.

INTRODUCTION

Observations of galaxy clusters since z ∼ 2 have established that
the cluster environment is anti-correlated with star formation in
galaxies (Kauffmann et al. 2004; Baldry et al. 2006; Balogh et al.
2007; Haines et al. 2013; Kovaˇc et al. 2014). This relation, when
taken into account with the discernible colour bimodality in clus-
ters, advocates the plausible role environment might be playing

in transforming the blue star-forming galaxies to the red passive
galaxies, and inducing a related morphological change.

Isolating the physical processes bringing about such transfor-
mations is crucial. High density environments within galaxy clus-
ter may simultaneously affect various properties of infalling galax-
ies through interactions with the hot intracluster medium (ICM) or
high speed galaxy-galaxy encounters. While strong tidal interac-
tions, or harassment (Boquien et al. 2009; Moore et al. 1996), are
capable of stripping outer material of galaxies, the raw material for
star formation in galaxies (namely the neutral hydrogen gas) is sel-
domly affected. This store of neutral gas may only be dislodged

when cluster galaxies pass through the ICM at high speed. Interac-
tions with the ICM result in stripping of the cold neutral atomic gas
from the star-forming disks (ram-pressure stripping Gunn & Gott
1972) or removal of hot gaseous halo through starvation, irrespec-
tive of halo mass (Larson, Tinsley & Caldwell 1980).

Kelkar et al. (2017, hereafter K17) explored the implications
of such physical drivers on galaxies’ intrinsic structure, revealed af-
ter removing the smooth component of the surface brightness dis-
tribution. For both cluster and ﬁeld galaxies, they found that the de-
gree of structural disturbance is better represented by the amount of
light left behind in galaxy residuals, with the quantitative asymme-
try (Conselice, Bershady & Jangren 2000) in galaxy residuals being
sensitive to the causes of structural disturbance. Furthermore, they
ﬁnd a higher incidence of visually smooth passive spiral galaxies
in clusters as compared to the ﬁeld. This result and several com-
plementary results (e.g. Wolf et al. 2009; Cantale et al. 2016) thus
draw our attention to the gas removal processes dominant in the
cluster environment, which result in the stripping of gas without
large-scale disruption in galaxy structure. However, the extent of
stripping within the cluster and the timescales over which these
processes occur are still open questions.

Revisiting the global picture of galaxy evolution in the context
of cluster environment, radial trends are observed in various galaxy
properties, like star formation (von der Linden et al. 2010; Maha-
jan, Raychaudhury & Pimbblet 2012), when observed as a function
of distance from the cluster centre. In the cluster cores, the early-
type passive galaxies are found to have lower line-of-sight veloc-
ities as compared to the late-type star-forming counterparts (Ma-
hajan, Mamon & Raychaudhury 2011), indicating star formation
evolution on a radial scale within the cluster. These observations
suggest the possibility of using the projected radial information as
well as the line-of-sight velocities of galaxies in clusters, to analyse
the galaxy properties in a dynamical environment. This 2-D pro-
jected ‘phase–space’ can be used to statistically segregate galaxies
according to their orbital histories and time of accretion.

Indeed, Gill, Knebe & Gibson (2005) discovered that the satel-
lite galaxy populations are better distinguished on this 2-D phase–
space, as compared to just 1-D clustercentric radius. Moreover, it is
also found that ∼ 50% galaxies within 2R200 have already passed
through the core at least once (Balogh, Navarro & Morris 2000).
Works like Mahajan, Mamon & Raychaudhury (2011) and Oman,
Hudson & Behroozi (2013) demonstrate that it is possible to trace
orbital histories of galaxies by analysing 3-D phase–space using
simulated galaxy clusters representing the local population. Such
assembly history of galaxy clusters enables us to associate cluster
galaxy populations to various regions of this phase–space. This can
separate the galaxies which are infalling from the galaxies which
are virialised in the cluster core, and identify galaxies which have
undergone at least one pericentric passage through the core (known
also as ‘backsplash’ galaxies).

Observationally, projection effects make it difﬁcult to identify
these backsplash galaxies on the 2-D phase–space (See Figure 6 in
Rhee et al. 2017). However, observations of e.g. the gas component
of galaxies can be used to identify such galaxies, as demonstrated
by Yoon et al. (2017) who combined the HI morphologies of galax-
ies in the Virgo cluster with their location on the projected phase–
space to identify the most likely backsplash galaxy subpopulation.
The projected phase–space, therefore, presents a powerful tool to
address current questions like quenching and group pre-processing
in infalling galaxies (e.g Oman & Hudson 2016), and their transfor-
mation by observing them ‘in action’ in dynamical environments
(e.g. Jaff´e et al. 2016). This approach has further been utilised

to study the velocity modulation of various galaxy properties like
quenching timescales (Muzzin et al. 2014; Taranu et al. 2014), HI
and ionised gas stripping in galaxies (Hern´andez-Fern´andez et al.
2014; Jaff´e et al. 2015; Rudnick et al. 2017), and dust temperatures
in galaxies (Noble et al. 2016).

In this paper, we seek to explore the links between the devia-
tions in the stellar distribution in galaxies, as introduced in K17,
and the star formation history of galaxies derived from spectro-
scopic information. Further, focussing on the cluster galaxies, we
investigate the behaviour of these structural distortions in galax-
ies over the dynamical cluster environment, given by the projected
phase–space. On connecting these trends with the relative stellar
ages of cluster galaxies, we attempt to further our knowledge re-
garding the observed morphological and star formation transition
in galaxies as they experience the high density cluster environment.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the
dataset, and describes the measures for global environment and
galaxy structure. Section 3 and 4 analyse and discuss the star for-
mation history of galaxies, and corrsponding correlations with en-
vironment and quantitative structure. In Section 5 we introduce the
projected phase–space, and analyse quantitative galaxy structure
and stellar ages as a function of position on the phase–space. Fi-
nally, in Section 7 we present a discussion of our results and con-
clusions. Throughout this paper, we use the standard ΛCDM Cos-
mology with h0 = 0.7, ΩΛ = 0.7 and Ωm = 0.3, and AB magni-
tudes.

2 DATA

The work presented in this paper employs the spectroscopic data
sample of K17 for the ten high-z clusters from the ESO Distant
Cluster Survey (EDisCS), which is a multiwavelength survey com-
prising 20 ﬁelds containing galaxy clusters in the redshift range
0.4 < z < 1 (White et al. 2005).

Each of these ten high-z clusters have HST I−band imaging
using the F 814W ﬁlter on the ACS Wide Field Camera, and V −,
R−, I−band photometry using the FORS2 on the ESO Very Large
Telescope (VLT) (White et al. 2005). The HST observations com-
prised a total of ﬁve pointings per ﬁeld centred at the location of the
brightest cluster galaxy such that the central region of each clus-
ter has higher S/N as compared to the surrounding area (Desai
et al. 2007). The spectroscopy with FORS2/VLT was carried out
on a subset of galaxies from the photometric sample selected using
the I-band magnitude and the best-ﬁt photometric redshift, as de-
scribed in Halliday et al. (2004) and Milvang-Jensen et al. (2008),
which ensures an average success rate of ∼50% with at most ∼3%
cluster members not satisfying the selection criteria. We refer the
reader to K17 for in-depth details regarding the survey data prod-
ucts and the follow-up data, which we have not included in this
paper to avoid repetition.

Our spectroscopic data sample has a mass-completeness limit
of log M∗/M(cid:12) = 10.6 and S/N > 2 in the continuum (which is
adopted from Rudnick et al. 2017). The S/N lower limit ensures
reliability in the measurement of spectral features which are utilised
to analyse the star formation histories of galaxies (Section 3). Note
however that Section 3 uses an extended sample with the empirical
mass-completeness limit of log M∗/M(cid:12) = 10.4 which permits us
to directly compare our results to the spectral analysis presented
in Rudnick et al. (2017). Furthermore, this paper implements the
structural analysis of galaxies carried out using the HST imaging as

introduced in K17, and are further described in Section 2.2. Table 1
summarises the properties of these clusters used in this analysis.

2.1 Global environment: cluster membership

We utilise the spectroscopic cluster membership to deﬁne the
global environment for our parent spectroscopic sample. Broadly,
a galaxy is considered a member of a cluster if its spectroscopic
redshift lies within ±3σcl from the average cluster redshift zcl else
they are considered to be in the ﬁeld sample (Milvang-Jensen et al.
2008; Halliday et al. 2004). Both zcl and σcl were computed by
successive ±3 sigma-clipping in the rest-frame peculiar velocity
distribution of galaxies till convergence was achieved. This itera-
tive method used the median for estimating zcl while σcl was deter-
mined using biweight estimator, the details of which are discussed
in Milvang-Jensen et al. (2008). To be accepted in the parent ﬁeld
sample, we allow the EDisCS galaxies to lie within ±0.2 from the
parent cluster redshift zcl (Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008). Further-
more, we avoid potential biases due to similar redshift distribution
of cluster and ﬁeld galaxies by selecting the ﬁeld galaxies within
±0.05 from the minimum and maximum zcl from the entire clus-
ter sample. Table 1 also includes the secondary structures denoted
by ‘a’ or ‘b’ following the main cluster ID (White et al. 2005;
Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008), and were further identiﬁed by Pog-
gianti et al. (2009) into ‘clusters’ (σcl > 400 km s−1) and ‘groups’
( 160 < σcl < 400 km s−1; containing a minimum of 8 spectro-
scopic members). Our deﬁnition of global environment however,
remains independent of the host cluster/group identiﬁcation.

2.2 Galaxy structure: qualitative and quantitative estimators

In this study we employ the extensive qualitative and quantitative
measurements of galaxy structure presented in K17. We obtain the
morphologies for the galaxies through visual classiﬁcation using
the HST I−band images carried out by ﬁve classiﬁers, the proce-
dure of which is detailed in Desai et al. (2007). While the HST
morphology catalog includes ﬁner morphological classes, we have
combined them into four broad bins: ellipticals, lenticulars, spirals,
and irregulars.

In addition, we assess qualitative galaxy structure by classify-
ing the degree of visual asymmetry and assigning a likely cause of
disturbances in the visible galaxy structure. These included iden-
tifying signatures of galaxy interaction, tidal stripping, ongoing
mergers, or any other structural asymmetry that could not be associ-
ated with any external processes. These classiﬁcations were carried
out by three classiﬁers, and each galaxy from the HST morphol-
ogy catalog was assigned a ﬁnal asymmetry and disturbance index
based on the weighted combination of individual classiﬁcations (for
details refer to K17).

Furthermore we utilise structural information embedded in
galaxy residuals after removing the bulk light by single Sersic
proﬁle ﬁtting with GALFIT (Barden et al. 2012). We measure the
fractional contribution to galaxy light distribution in residuals
through residual ﬂux fraction (RF F ; Hoyos et al. 2011, 2012),
and deﬁne the asymmetry in galaxy residuals (Ares; Conselice,
Bershady & Jangren 2000) to be the departure from a symmetric
light distribution under 180 degree rotation. K17 demonstrated
that these measurements of RF F and Ares together are crucial in
identifying structural signatures in galaxies. Individually, RF F
is found to be sensitive to the degree of structural disturbance
or ‘roughness’ in galaxies but is indecisive in determining the

physical causes of such disturbance. The Ares however is efﬁcient
in discriminating between likely physical processes causing
the structural asymmetry, and hence the disturbance in galaxy
structure. Figure 5 in K17 highlights these characteristics where
visually classiﬁed mergers are found to have have the highest
Ares while internally asymmetric, and interacting galaxies display
some of the lowest Ares values. An in-depth discussion of these
measurements, and their correlation with qualitative structural
disturbances and morphology is further included in K17.

3 STAR FORMATION HISTORY FROM SPECTRAL

INDICES

In addition to the galaxy structural measurements of K17, in this
paper we use the spectroscopy to derive star formation histories
for individual galaxies from spectral indices. A galaxy that has ex-
perienced a recent burst of star formation (∼0.5–2 Gyr ago), or
has had its star formation recently truncated shows strong Balmer
absorption lines in its spectrum. This is because Balmer absorp-
tion lines, attributed to A-type stars, peak in strength after the
hot O and B stars have ceased their evolution. In particular, we
utilise Hδ and Hγ Balmer lines as they can be robustly measured
in the continuum spectra for the wavelength range of our sample
(for details refer to Rudnick et al. 2017). The HδA and HγA in-
dices (incorporating the EW of the Hδ and Hγ lines), therefore
are indicative of the time since the recent episode of star forma-
tion in the galaxies (Worthey & Ottaviani 1997). Moreover, these
indices also depend on metallicity and α/F e ratio, which is im-
portant for older stellar populations (Thomas, Maraston & Korn
2004). A measure of the overall age of the stellar population, on
the other hand, could be represented by the strength of the break
occurring at 4000 ˚A (Balogh et al. 1999, Dn4000 hereafter) as it
traces recent star formation on timescales longer than those indi-
cated by Balmer absorption. This break depends on metallicity and
arises due to the accumulation of metal absorption lines on the blue
side of the spectrum. Kauffmann et al. (2003) shows that the locus
of the plane constructed using these spectral indices give a good
relative (though not unique) measure of the star formation history
of galaxies. Moreover, the variation in HδA, HγA, and Dn4000 is
relatively insensitive to dust extinction, making them a reliable di-
agnostic to assess whether star formation occurred in bursts or in
continuous mode.

In this paper, we present a simpliﬁed stellar population anal-
ysis which will be detailed in Deger et al. (2018b, in prep). The
relative star formation history (SFH hereafter) of galaxies in the
parent spectroscopic sample was determined through the indices
obtained using the spectral decomposition of the galaxies and re-
quiring empirical mass completeness of log M∗/M(cid:12) > 10.4, and
S/N > 2 in the continuum (Rudnick et al. 2017). Although the de-
tailed decomposition of galaxies’ spectrum is performed as a part
of the work presented in Rudnick et al., the analysis pertaining to
studying the interlink between SFH and galaxy structure adopts the
above a mass-completeness limit. Speciﬁcally, we use the HδA and
HγA indices, and Dn4000 in the continuum of the spectra to inves-
tigate the SFH of galaxies. We further improve the S/N of Balmer
absorption by taking the average of HδA and HγA indices which
can also mitigate the systematic offsets that each index has when
compared to models (Rudnick et al. 2017).

completeness limit of log M∗/M(cid:12) = 10.4. The points are colour-
coded by the [OII]λ3727 EW which traces the current star for-
mation in galaxies (Gallagher, Hunter & Bushouse 1989; Kenni-
cutt 1992). Further, to understand the distribution of points on this
plane, we use the model tracks with solar metallicity derived from
the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar population synthesis code.
These model tracks include a single burst model of star formation, a
constant star formation history model, and three models with expo-
nentially declining SFHs with a timescale of 0.3, 1, and 2 Gyr. All
the models extend to an age of 6 Gyr, which roughly corresponds
to star-forming at z = 2.5 for a galaxy observed at the lower end
of the EDisCS redshift range z = 0.4.

Following from Figure 1, galaxies are separated based on their
relative stellar ages as galaxies with - ‘young’ (top left), ‘intermedi-
ate’ (middle), and ‘old’ (bottom right) stellar populations. The line
dividing the galaxies with older stellar populations was determined
based on the isolation of the peak of these galaxies in the histogram
of the galaxy sample (Figure 2, Rudnick et al. 2017). It is thus ob-
served that galaxies selected in such a way have negligible recent
star formation (∼ 6 e-foldings of SFH). The rest of the galaxies
were then split into galaxies with intermediate and young stellar
populations. The division for these galaxies was chosen to split the
difference in the Balmer absorption and Dn4000 strength between
the exponential SFH with a timescale of 2 Gyr and a constant SFR
model. A detailed description of these borders is presented in Rud-
nick et al. (2017).

Figure 1 also shows the post-starburst or ‘k+a’ galaxies in the
sample. The relative fractions of ‘k+a’ galaxies in the EDisCS clus-
ters were previously studied by Poggianti et al. (2009), who use
Gaussian line ﬁtting technique to determine the EWs of Balmer
absorption. In the present work, the ‘k+a’ galaxies are deﬁned us-
ing the more accurate Balmer absorption from HδA and HγA in-
dices. The speciﬁc selection criteria we use are EW[OII]< 5 ˚A, and
(HδA+HγA)/2>3 ˚A. The sample of galaxies thus identiﬁed as ‘k+a’
are all cluster members (except one), and is different from Pog-
gianti et al. (2009), primarily because their method was different.
These galaxies will be further investigated in Section 4.

log M∗/M(cid:12) > 10.4 in the EDisCS spectroscopic sample, irrespective

tor of star formation activity. The galaxies are further divided into galaxies
with young, intermediate and older stellar populations, as described in the
text (black dashed lines). The overplotted tracks denote the modelled evolu-
tion of stellar population with solar metallicities (Bruzual & Charlot 2003)

4 CORRELATION OF STAR FORMATION HISTORY

WITH GALAXY STRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENT

The results of K17 show a strong correlation between quantita-
tive measurements of structural disturbances (RF F and Ares) and
qualitative measurements of visual structural disturbances and mor-
phology. Moreover, the analysis of the (U − V ) vs. (V − J) colour
plane reveals that passive galaxies are mostly structurally smoother
and more symmetric, with low values of RF F and Ares. This link
between galaxy ‘roughness’, ‘asymmetry’, and current star forma-
tion, indicates a possible correlation of intrinsic galaxy structure
with the SFH of galaxies.

We therefore investigate the variations in RF F and Ares with
the evolution of star formation over a global cluster and ﬁeld envi-
ronment. We use the cluster sample and the redshift-controlled ﬁeld
sample for this analysis, as described in Section 2.1. Figures 2 & 3
show the average Balmer absorption plotted against Dn4000 for
the spectroscopic sample and colour-coded with RF F and Ares. At
a glance, the RF F and Ares display a strong interdependence with
the SFH of galaxies indicated by the average age of their stellar
population. Indeed, galaxies with recent star formation are asym-
metric and show a higher degree of roughness/texture while galax-
ies with high Dn4000 display smoother structure with low RF F
and Ares values. This observation is further strengthened by the dis-
tribution of galaxy morphologies on this plane. As expected, galax-
ies displaying early-type morphologies populate the lower right re-
gion with high Dn4000, while the late-type/irregular galaxies show
ongoing star formation as indicated by relatively higher average
Balmer absorption and [OII] emission (cf. Figure 1). Comparing
both panels of Figures 2 & 3, the only environmental effect seen
is the build-up of older population in clusters. This implies that, ir-
respective of morphology or global environment, it is possible to
broadly identify galaxies with different SFHs based on the rough-
ness and asymmetry in structure. This result has important con-
notations as both RF F and Ares are purely structural quantities
measured from the deviations in the galaxy light from a smooth
symmetric proﬁle.

Revisiting the ‘k+a’ galaxies as described in Figure 1, it is
worth noting that all the ‘k+a’ galaxies in the sample are detected in
clusters1 and lie in the region which has high RF F and Ares on the
average Balmer absorption vs Dn4000 plane. Moreover, the RF F
and Ares of these ‘k+a’ galaxies have an average value of 0.05 and
0.5 respectively, which is on the border of the deﬁnition separating
the rough/smooth and symmetric/asymmetric galaxies in the sam-
ple (cf. Section 6). This result may support the ﬁndings of Pawlik
et al. (2016) which show that the shape asymmetry of galaxies, a
similar but slightly different measure of quantitative morphology, is
found to be strongly correlated with the age of starburst activity in
galaxies. They ﬁnd young starbursts displaying distinct asymmet-
ric features indicative of recent merger activity. However, our sub-
sample is too small to robustly conﬁrm this result with the mea-
surement of RF F and Ares. A more thourough analysis of these
‘k+a’ galaxies will be presented in Deger et al. (2018b, in prep).

Figure 2. The (HδA + HγA)/2 vs Dn4000 plane is colour-coded according to RF F values for the cluster (left panel) and ﬁeld (right panel) galaxies: redder
colours indicate smoother, undisturbed galaxies while bluer colours denote ‘roughness’. The symbols indicate the morphology of galaxies, as explained in
Section 2. As in Figure 1, the dashed lines show the selection boundaries for galaxies with young, intermediate and older stellar populations. Galaxies with
ongoing star formation or with younger stellar populations are consistently found to be ‘rougher’ irrespective of morphology or global environment.

Figure 3. Similar to Figure 2, the (HδA + HγA)/2 vs Dn4000 plane is colour-coded according to Ares for cluster (left panel) and ﬁeld (right panel) galaxies:
redder colours denote ‘symmetric’ galaxies with low Ares while bluer colours show galaxies with higher asymmetry. Galaxies with ongoing star formation or
with younger stellar populations appear to be structurally asymmetric irrespective of morphology or global environment.

Figure 4. RF F distribution for the galaxies with Old (O), Intermediate (I) and Young (Y) stellar ages in Cluster (C)/Field (F) environment. The galaxies are separated in different stellar ages according to the
boundaries represented in Figure 1. Each row shows the RF F distribution for the galaxies at ﬁxed morphology: all (top), E/S0 (middle), Sp (bottom). Columns (i) and (ii) compare the RF F distribution for the
three stellar ages in the cluster and ﬁeld environments, respectively. Columns (iii) to (v) show the RF F distribution for cluster and ﬁeld galaxies for each of the stellar age classiﬁcations. The inset p-values represent
the two sample K–S test probalities for the two distributions being statistically similar. It is evident that the older stellar ages display lower RF F values as compared to the intermediate and younger stellar ages,
and this effect is more signiﬁcant in cluster environment. Further, the RF F distibution for galaxies with younger, intermdeiate and older stellar populations are similar irrespective of their incidence in the cluster or
ﬁeld environments.

quantitative structure, we evaluate the distributions of RF F and
Ares for each galaxy subpopulation deﬁned by their stellar ages.
Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution of RF F and Ares for galax-
ies with old, intermediate and young stellar ages across cluster and
ﬁeld environments. We use the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(K–S) tests to check the signiﬁcance of the variation in the RF F
and Ares distributions for different stellar ages, under the null hy-
pothesis that each sample of cluster and ﬁeld galaxies with different
ages are drawn from tha same RF F and Ares distribution.

Panels (1i) and (1ii) in both ﬁgures show a strong stratiﬁca-
tion of RF F and Ares across stellar ages in the cluster environ-
ment ((cid:29) 3σ signiﬁcance). However, this difference is less signiﬁ-
cant in the ﬁeld galaxy population due to the smaller sample size.
The morphology dependence of these two structural diagnostics is
taken into account by evaluating the cumulative distribution func-
tion (CDF) at ﬁxed morphology (Figures 4 and 5, Panels 2i, 2ii, 3i,
3ii; see also Figure 4 from K17). ‘Old’ E+S0 are smoother as com-
pared to ‘intermediate’ E+S0 in the cluster environment. Further,
as expected the ‘young’ E/S0 are in the minority (only 1) in clus-
ters and show high RF F and Ares. In the ﬁeld environment, how-
ever, this difference becomes less signiﬁcant, but the numbers are
very small. This difference is further emphasised for spiral galaxies
in clusters. The ‘old’ cluster spirals are found to be smoother, and
more symmetric than the ‘intermediate’ and ‘young’ cluster spirals,
with the difference not being observed in the ﬁeld. Combining the
results from Figures 2 and 3, this effect is attributed to the charac-
teristic morphology content observed in clusters, with high-density
environment harbouring early-type morphologies and older stellar
populations.

Looking at all the galaxies together, at ﬁxed morphology, there
is little to no signiﬁcant difference in the distribution of RF F and
Ares for old, intermediate and young galaxies living in clusters or
in the ﬁeld. This is shown in columns (iii) to (v), which present
the RF F and Ares distribution for the cluster and ﬁeld galaxies,
categorised by their stellar ages. At ﬁxed ages and morphologies,
cluster and ﬁeld galaxies have similar structural parameters.

In summary, the roughness and asymmetry in the structure of
a galaxy can generally be considered as the main determinants of
the luminosity-weighted age of its stellar population.

There is no signiﬁcant environmental difference in the distri-
bution of RF F and Ares for galaxies with similar ages and mor-
phologies. Environment changes the proportion of ‘old’ galaxies
but does not alter the SFH and structure of galaxies, corroborating
the results from K17 (See also, Thomas et al. 2010).

5 THE PROJECTED PHASE–SPACE OF EDISCS

CLUSTERS

5.1 Construction of the stacked cluster

The projected phase–space (PPS hereafter) is constructed using de-
rived cluster properties σcl, R200 and cluster centre, while assum-
ing spherical symmetry in the clusters. However, as the number of
spectroscopic cluster members from each EDisCS cluster is mod-
est, it is not possible to determine trends of galaxy properties on the
PPS of each individual cluster. We therefore stack individual scaled
clusters together to create a combined projected phase–space using
the line-of-sight velocity and the clustercentric distance of the clus-
ter galaxies. This method is based on the assumption of the univer-
sal mass proﬁle for cosmological halos (Navarro, Frenk & White

1997) and is widely used in constructing projected phase–space of
clusters (for example, Rines et al. 2003). We select clusters for this
analysis, according to the following criteria:

• clusters for which we have robust spectroscopy and HST

I−band imaging data (refer to Section 2).

• clusters for which the distribution of the radial velocities in the
cluster rest-frame is reasonably Gaussian, as determined by visual
inspection.

• clusters that have reasonably symmetric spatial distribution of
galaxies (also determined visually) in the sky with the brightest
cluster galaxy located as centrally as possible.

• clusters that have spectroscopic coverage to at

least ∼
0.7R200, and have 20 or more spectroscopically conﬁrmed cluster
members.2

The reader is referred to Milvang-Jensen et al. (2008) for the de-
tailed spectroscopic, spatial and velocity information on which
these selections are based.

With these criteria, the new cluster sample comprises eight
clusters (incuding secondary clusters) out of the original sample
(cf. Table 1). This stacked cluster has a mean redshift (cid:104)z(cid:105) (cid:39) 0.65
and (cid:104)R200(cid:105) (cid:39) 1.14 Mpc. Note that this stacking is done after scal-
ing the cluster-centric radius of galaxies by the R200 of the parent
cluster, and the peculiar velocities by the velocity dispersion σ of
the parent cluster (cf. Table 1). Figure 6 shows R200 vs. σ for the
clusters used in the stacking. The ﬁnal cluster sample for this analy-
sis thus contains a total of 181 cluster galaxies. The complementary
ﬁeld sample is consistent with the sample presented in K17 and is
described in Section 2.1. Note that all the galaxies in this analysis
have log M∗/M(cid:12) > 10.6, which is the mass completeness limit
for the parent spectroscopic sample (Vulcani et al. 2010).

Rhodes (2013) analysed the 3-D and projected phase–space
for intermediate-z clusters matched with the EDisCS cluster sam-
ple from N-body simulations populated by semi-analytic models,
and used the co-ordinates of galaxies on the phase–space to iden-
tify various regions out to ∼ 5R200. It was found from this analysis
that there is > 80% probability of the cluster galaxy to be bound
in the cluster potential within 0.5R200 at intermediate redshifts.
Moreover, as the cluster assembles, infalling galaxies approach the
cluster at higher radii while gaining velocity as they reach the clus-
ter core. These galaxies then settle in the cluster due to dynamical
friction. This process leaves a signature on the PPS, approximated
best with a triangular shape (Mahajan, Mamon & Raychaudhury
2011; Jaff´e et al. 2015). Thus, combining the ﬁndings from Maha-
jan, Mamon & Raychaudhury (2011) and Rhodes (2013), we de-
ﬁne a triangular region with the boundaries at r = 0.5R200 and
|δv| = 2σcl on the stacked PPS to delineate the likely virialised
region. This region is then used to select the ‘virialised’ galaxies
from the ‘infalling’ galaxies at higher |δv| and higher r.

Figures 7 and 8 show the PPS for the EDisCS cluster galax-
ies with different morphologies, colour-coded with RF F and Ares
respectively. This PPS corroborates the observed distribution of
galaxy morphology in galaxy clusters, with Table 2 showing the
fraction of galaxies lying within and outside the virial region for
each morphology type. We use the Wilson (1927) binomial conﬁ-
dence interval to compute the 1σ uncertainty δ ´fi in the fractions

2 Note that not all the clusters used in the phase-space analysis have spec-
troscopic coverage reaching beyond 0.7R200.

It is interesting to note that although the majority of the late-
type Sp galaxies are prevalent in the cluster outskirts, the early-
type E/S0 galaxies show similar fractions in both cluster regions
but have lower velocity dispersion, which is an indication that they
are an older cluster population. The presence of E/S0s at large clus-
tercentric distances is partly a result of the known effect of pre-
processing in groups prior infall into the cluster (Jaff´e et al. 2016;
Oman & Hudson 2016), or simply they all could be backsplash
galaxies (See also Balogh, Navarro & Morris 2000). Likewise, ir-
regulars caused by mergers are more likely to be formed outside
the cluster cores, where the relative velocities between the galax-
ies allow for galaxy-galaxy encounters to take place. However, the
smaller numbers of irregulars in our sample prevent us from ex-
ploring this scenario further. The RF F and Ares however do not
seem to show a signiﬁcant trend across the PPS. Moreover the ‘k+a’
galaxies in Figures 7 and 8 tend to avoid the cluster core, support-
ing the idea that they are a transitory cluster population (see also
Muzzin et al. 2014).

6 GALAXY STRUCTURE AND STAR FORMATION

HISTORY AS A FUNCTION OF LOCATION ON THE
PPS

The PPS thus constructed provides a unique snapshot into the clus-
ters assembling their galaxies at (cid:104)z(cid:105) ∼ 0.65. From Figures 7

Figure 7. The observed PPS for the EDisCS cluster galaxies with differ-
ent morphologies, colour-coded according to RF F . The dashed bound-
ary encompasses the ‘virial’ region, as discussed in Section 5.1. All the
galaxies outside this region are considered as infalling galaxies. The verti-
cal dotted line indicates the required minimum spectroscopic coverage for
the stacked PPS. The solid curves are derived from the dark matter halo
proﬁle (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997) computed using the median cluster
mass of our sample, and the corresponding σcl and R200 (Table 1). This ob-
served PPS corroborates the observed distribution of galaxy morphology in
galaxy clusters: the majority of the early-type galaxies lie within the virial
region while late-type galaxies are prevalent in the cluster outskirts.

6.1 RF F and Ares as a function of location on the PPS

In order to study the implications of galaxy structure on such a
cluster-wide scale, we next look into the distribution of RF F and
Ares on the PPS for each morphology type. To quantify the dis-
tribution of RF F on the PPS, we divide the galaxy sample into
‘rough’/‘smooth’ galaxies based on the boundary in RF F distri-
bution encompassing majority of the early-type (E+S0) galaxies
(K17). This boundary was qualitatively determined using the me-
dian RF F of E+S0 galaxies as an initial approximation. Following
this, galaxies with RF F > 0.05 formed the subclass of ‘rough’
galaxies while galaxies with RF F (cid:54) 0.05 formed the subclass
of ‘smooth’ galaxies. Using a similar approach to the Ares dis-
tribution, we classiﬁed galaxies as ‘asymmetric’ if they displayed
Ares > 0.5 while galaxies with Ares (cid:54) 0.5 were considered ‘sym-
metric’. Table 3 gives the fractions of quantitative structure for each

Figure 10. Similar to Figure 9, Ares distribution on the PPS for galaxies of each morphological type. Although the majority of early-type galaxies (E+S0) are
symmetric, they show equal fractions of asymmetric and symmetric galaxies in the virial, and infall region of the cluster. For the spiral galaxies, the majority
are asymmetric with no obvious dependence on the local environment.

morphology type in the virial and infalling regions as well for the
ﬁeld environment.

The elliptical galaxies show equal fractions of smooth, rough,
symmetric and asymmetric galaxies across all cluster regions, and
the ﬁeld. This trend is also mirrored in the fractions observed for
the lenticular galaxies. The fact that lenticular galaxies show no
signiﬁcant changes in structure irrespective of their position on the
PPS relates to the observation by Jaff´e et al. (2011a) that cluster el-
lipticals and lenticulars are found to have similar stellar population
ages inferred from their colours. We would thus expect them to be
equally smooth and symmetric. As evident from the lower left pan-
els in Figure 9 and 10 for spiral galaxies and Table 3, most spirals
in the cluster are rough and asymmetric. However, there is no obvi-
ous difference in the RF F and Ares distributions of spiral galaxies
across environments.

We also look at the variation of visual disturbance classes
(K17; Table 3) for spirals in various cluster regions and the ﬁeld.
The majority of the spirals in the virial region are found to be visu-
ally undisturbed as compared to the cluster outskirts and the ﬁeld.
In contrast, the fraction of externally disturbed spiral galaxies does

not seem to depend on the local environment. This observation sup-
ports the lack of environmental dependence of visual disturbance
classes, as found in K17. In particular, we note in K17 that Ares is
sensitive to mergers which are relatively harder to occur in dense
cluster environments. Although not a part of this paper, this premise
has been extensively explored in the recent EDisCS paper by Deger
et al. (2018), where they combine the visual disturbance classiﬁ-
cations from K17 with alternative quantitative measures of Gini
(G) and M20, which together are efﬁcient in merger detection. Ex-
ploring the global and local environment (through PPS analysis),
Deger et al. report that the fraction of tidal interactions and merg-
ers (fT IM ) shows no signiﬁcant trend as a function of environment,
except for a mild boost at intermediate/group environments and a
probable enhancement at very high densities. A probable expla-
nation for the lack of any signiﬁcant trends is that a slower pro-
cess like morphological transformation would occur on timescales
greater than cluster crossing time (∼ 2 Gyrs, see Section 6.2) and
hence the signatures would get washed out in the PPS. A simi-
lar scenario was proposed by Jaff´e et al. (2011b), who, using the
same galaxy sample, found that, while kinematical disturbances in

the gas present in galaxies are correlated with the environment, the
stellar light distribution remains independent of environment, sug-
gesting longer timescales for structural transformation as compared
to variation in stellar ages.

We brieﬂy revisit the global structural properties of galaxies
like single S´ersic indices, galaxy sizes and bulge-to-total luminos-
ity ratio (B/T), and investigate their correlation with the position
on PPS. Kelkar et al. (2015) demonstrate that the sizes of EDisCS
galaxies appear to not depend on the global cluster-ﬁeld environ-
ment, irrespective of being compared over ﬁxed morphology or
galaxy colours. Building on the sample utilised in Kelkar et al.
(2015), we present a comparison of galaxy sizes (Re) over the in-
ternal cluster environment ie. within and outside virial radius as de-
ﬁned in Section 5, in Figure 11. We also demonstrate results of two-
sample K–S tests perfomed to check the signiﬁcance of the varia-
tion in Re across the virial and infall regions, under the null hy-
pothesis that each sample of these cluster galaxies are drawn from
the same Re distribution. Complementing Figure 2 from Kelkar
et al. (2015), our analysis further establishes that galaxies indeed
have similar sizes across the varied cluster environment, at a ﬁxed
morphology.

The systematic variation in S´ersic index (n) of galaxies, at a
ﬁxed stellar mass, could robustly hint at the merging and strong
gravitational interactions which the galaxies underwent. We thus
split our sample into universal categories based on S´ersic indices,
namely ‘disks’ (n (cid:54) 2.5), and ‘spheroids’ (2.5 < n (cid:54) 4). Note

however, that due to the asymptotic nature of the single S´ersic pro-
ﬁle for large n, a third category of galaxies is deﬁned with n (cid:62) 4.
Figure 12 shows the PPS of galaxies for each morphology type,
colour-coded according to these broad structural categories. Simi-
lar to Re distribution on PPS, we employ the two sample K–S test
to statistically quantify the variation in the distribution of ‘disk’
and ‘spheroid’ galaxies across the virial, and infall regions of PPS.
While the mix of disky/spheroidal galaxies is different for different
morphology types, the majority of cluster ellipticals have n > 4
which is unsurprising as cluster ellipticals, especially in the core,
are brighter and massive, and hence are expected to have higher n.
Moreover, the n distribution for the ellipticals in the virial and in-
fall regions is similar. This result is somewhat contradictory to the
observation made by D’Onofrio, Marziani & Buson (2015) who
demonstrate that the cluster ellipticals at EDisCS redshifts, at a
ﬁxed stellar mass, consistently show lower n at smaller cluster-
centric radius suggestive of loss of stellar envelope in galaxies at
such high densities. Note however that our analysis uses a 2-D ap-
proach applied over a limited mass range which could be a reason
for the apparent lack of trend. The spirals in the virial region, on the
other hand, marginally have higher n while spirals in infall regions
tend to show low n, with a conﬁdence > 95% (lower right panel
of Figure 12). This suggests that the spirals in the densest cluster
environment are more bulge-dominated as compared to rest of the
disky cluster spirals. This result has important connotations on the
reported structural evolution of cluster spirals to bulge-dominated

lenticular galaxies via plausible environmental channels. To ex-
plore this further, we look into the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio
(B/T) (GIM2D; Simard 2010; Saglia et al. 2010) of our galaxies
as a function of PPS (Figure 13). Surprisingly, we report that the
B/T distribution in the virial and infall regions is similar irrespec-
tive of their morphology, with the ellipticals and lenticulars having
higher B/T in general than the cluster spirals. The modest increase
in the n of the cluster spirals in virial region and the subsequently
unchanged B/T across the internal cluster environment, may hint
towards a physical processes like tidal stripping affecting the out-
ermost stars in the disk of infalling spirals thus lowering their n
as opposed to bulge-building merger processes in core spirals. Al-
ternatively, the core galaxies morphologically classiﬁed as spirals
may not have grown their bulges enough to be detected by our mea-
surement.

In summary, galaxies of the same morphology in the virial
region are not different from the infalling galaxies with respect to
their RF F and Ares, though there is a hint of environmental trend

in the distribution of n. These observations suggest there are no
signiﬁcant changes in the structure of galaxies irrespective of their
position on the PPS; at the very least these changes perhaps are not
observable on short timescales.

6.2 Stellar ages a function of location on the PPS: a glimpse

at accumulating passive galaxies

We next investigate the ages of stellar populations in galaxies as a
function of the location on the PPS. Figure 14 shows the PPS for
the galaxies of each morphological type colour-coded according to
the age of their stellar populations (cf. Section 3). In contrast to the
lack of structural trends with environment, several conclusions can
be drawn regarding trends with age.

The majority of the elliptical galaxies are ‘old’ and tend to
populate the virialized regions while the ‘intermediate’ age ellip-
ticals avoid the cluster core. This observation is further supported

performed under the null hypothesis that the virial and infall galaxies are drawn from the same n distribution. Majority of ellipticals show n > 4 while most
of the spirals have n (cid:54) 2.5. Interestingly, the infalling cluster spirals show smaller n as compared to spiral galaxies in the central regions of the stacked cluster
suggesting a possible dependence of n on internal cluster environment.

by the fractions of ellipticals with old, intermediate, and younger
stellar ages in the cluster regions and the ﬁeld (cf. Table 3). Note
however that some of the old elliptical galaxies seen in the infall
region may have been pre-processed or internally quenched, while
some will be older cluster members that are not observed in the viri-
alised triangle due to scatter in the PPS and contamination (Rhee
et al. 2017).

The lenticular galaxies, however, show the interesting prop-
erty that the vast majority of the ﬁeld lenticulars harbour older
stellar populations. In all cluster environments (the virial and in-
fall regions), ‘old’ lenticulars are seen to be dominant but there are
some cluster lenticulars with intermediate stellar ages. Although
the number of ﬁeld lenticulars is small, this could suggest that the
evolutionary history of ﬁeld and cluster lenticulars may be differ-
ent. The transformation of spirals into lenticulars is being environ-
mentally driven, while the ﬁeld lenticulars could originate from spi-

shown to have highest B/T, the overall variation of B/T across the PPS, for

rals whose gas supply has been exhausted or through minor mergers
(Arnold et al. 2011).

For the spiral galaxies, the fraction of ‘old’ spirals increases
towards the core, indicating the build up of older populations in
clusters. This is clearly a cluster phenomenon originating, perhaps,
on the cessation of star formation as the galaxies enter cluster core,
where they remain and become old. On the other hand, the fraction
of spirals with younger stellar populations shows a complementary
increase towards the ﬁeld. This observation likely supports the ﬁnd-
ings from recent works like Biviano et al. (2016), where they ob-
serve that passive and star-forming galaxies have similar elongated
orbits with increasing clustercentric radii at intermediate redshift.
Moreover, these orbits are similar to those of star-forming galax-
ies in z = 0 clusters, suggesting a prominent orbital evolution for
the passive galaxies with time. Interestingly, the fraction of ‘inter-
mediate’ age spirals remains approximately constant over all envi-
ronments. While a fraction of these ‘intermediate’ age spirals may

truly denote the spiral galaxies in transition at these redshifts, one
must be careful while considering these spirals as their incidence
in different cluster regions may partially be attributed to projection
effects.

The presence of ‘intermediate’ age cluster spirals and lentic-
ulars, and the higher fraction of ‘old’ spirals in the cluster core
illustrate the proliferation of passive old galaxies in cluster cores.
Consistent fractions of ‘intermediate’ age spirals across the infall
and core regions would arise if spiral galaxies are able to form stars
for a signiﬁcant amount of time after infalling into the cluster. Con-
sidering our stacked cluster from the PPS analysis, it takes ∼ 2
Gyrs for a galaxy with a peculiar velocity ∼ 600 km/s to reach
the cluster core from the virial radius, thereby suggesting an en-
vironmental process acting over this timescale. The possibility of
such prolonged mechanism affecting star formation in cluster spi-
rals thus rules out rapid shutdown of star formation in spirals upon
infalling into clusters (See Cantale et al. 2016). With the observed
lack of strong trends in the RF F and Ares distributions across the
PPS, galaxy starvation stands as likely candidate which can deplete
the hot gas in these cluster galaxies for a longer period of time
without affecting intrinsic galaxy structure.

The build up of passive ‘old’ spirals in cluster cores, how-
ever, suggests two possibilities: that either galaxies encountering
the dense ICM in cluster cores most likely experience rapid removal
of cold gas through mechanisms like Ram pressure stripping, even-
tually turning them passive, or that they have been in the cluster for
a long time. In both cases, the global galaxy structure remains intact
as substantiated by the insigniﬁcant dependence of RF F and Ares
as a function of position on the PPS. This scenario is supported by
complementary results by Rudnick et al. (2017) who demonstrate
that older cluster galaxies with weak [OII] emission avoid the core
region in clusters. The end result in either case would thus be ob-
served as the accumulation of ‘old’ spirals in cluster cores. The
associated morphological transition of ‘old’ spirals into early-type
galaxies happens gradually with the ‘old’ spirals slowly losing the
star formation in their disks due to loss of gas, and possibly trans-
forming into lenticulars. These lenticulars may show a ﬁnal episode
of star formation in their centres (Johnston, Arag´on-Salamanca &
Merriﬁeld 2014) building a larger bulge.

7 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we present a study of the putative links that may ex-
ist between the internal properties of galaxies, such as their mor-
phology, structure and star formation history (SFH), and the differ-
ent cluster environments identiﬁed using the projected phase–space
(PPS) for a sample of intermediate redshift (0.4 < z < 0.8) cluster
and ﬁeld galaxies from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS).
Using HST I−band images (rest-frame ∼ B) we ﬁt simple
smooth symmetric models to the galaxies’ surface brightness pro-
ﬁles and measure deviations of the galaxies’ light distributions from
these models with two parameters, Ares (asymmetry of the residu-
als from the model ﬁts, ‘asymmetry’ for short) and RF F (residual
ﬂux fraction, or the fraction of the total galaxy light present in the
residuals, measuring ‘roughness’).

Using VLT multi-object spectroscopy, we derive age-sensitive
spectral indicators (HδA, HγA and Dn4000) to obtain informa-
tion on the star-formation histories of the galaxies. High-quality
spectroscopic redshifts are used to build projected phase–space di-
agrams for a subset of the clusters. These are plots of the radial
velocities of the cluster galaxies in the rest-frame of the cluster nor-

spirals with younger stellar population are found in the cluster outskirts.

malised by its velocity dispersion (σclus) vs. their projected radial
distances from the cluster centre in units of its virial radius (R200).
To improve the statistics, we stack these diagrams and build an av-
erage PPS diagram for these clusters.

Analysing the galaxies’ properties in conjunction with their
environmental information derived from the PPS we reach the fol-
lowing conclusions:

(iii) We report that infalling spirals marginally have low single

S´ersic index as compared to spiral galaxies in cluster core.

(iv) Incorporating the visual information provided by Kelkar
et al. (2017) on the degree of disturbance observed in the galaxies’
HST images, we ﬁnd that the virial region of the cluster contains a
higher fraction of visually undisturbed spirals than the cluster out-
skirts and the ﬁeld.

(i) The quantitative structural measurements Ares and RF F
correlate very well with the age of the galaxies’ stellar populations
derived from the (HδA + HγA)/2 vs. Dn4000 plane. At a ﬁxed
morphology, young, star-forming galaxies are consistently rougher
and more asymmetric than older ones. Ares and RF F become pro-
gressive lower with time since the latest episodes of star formation.
(ii) We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation between the position of the
galaxies on the PPS and their stellar ages, irrespective of their mor-
phology. We also observe an increasing fraction of galaxies with
older stellar populations towards the cluster core, but parallel trends
of the galaxies’ structural parameters (Ares and RF F ) with PPS
location are not observed.

These results have important implications for the overall pic-
ture of galaxy transformation within the context of environmental
effects. The dwindling fraction of spirals with young stellar popula-
tions in the cluster core suggests that, as a galaxy is accreted into the
virialised region, its star-formation is reduced and its stellar popula-
tion ages. Since galaxy morphology and quantitative measurements
of galaxy structure such as RF F and Ares correlate with SFH, we
would naively expect that corresponding trends between these pa-
rameters and location in PPS should also be observed. The fact that
these trends are not observed suggests that the timescales involved
in the suppression of star formation of cluster galaxies are signif-
icantly shorter that the timsecales for their structural and morpho-

logical transformation, in agreement with the ﬁndings of Kelkar
et al. (2017). In other words, galaxies start becoming structurally
smoother and more symmetric as their star formation is reduced
and ceases, but their morphological transformation happens later
(see also Wolf et al. 2009; Jaff´e et al. 2011b).

Given the limitations of the sample and available data, and
the lack of information on the properties and distribution of the
intra-cluster medium, it is not possible to know with any certainty
what the actual physical causes of the proposed transformations
are. However, we can conﬁdently say that galaxies with old stellar
populations are structurally smoother and more symmetric, but the
actual morphological change will follow later, once the star forma-
tion has already been truncated. The most obvious effect of the en-
vironment is the accumulation of the old early-type passive galax-
ies in the cluster core. We speculate that the explanation for this
could either be the result of relatively gentle cluster-speciﬁc mech-
anisms such as ram-pressure stripping and galaxy starvation, or the
result of the cluster buildup history. Or, more likely, a combination
of both.
