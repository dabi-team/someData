Abstract 

Gas electron multipliers (GEMs) with wire (WGEMs) or metal electrodes (MGEMs), which don’t 
use any plastic insulators between electrodes are created. The chambers containing MGEMs (WGEMs) 
with pin-anodes are proposed as detectors for searching of spin-dependent interactions between Dark 
Matter (DM) particles and gases with nonzero-spin nuclei (1H, D2, 3He, 19F, 21Ne, 129Xe, 131Xe, etc.). In this 
paper, we present a review of such chambers. As photosensitive addition we use of H2, C2H4, CF4, TMAE, 
etc.  

For investigation of the gas mixtures Ne+10%H2, H2 (D2) +3ppmTMAE, the chamber containing 
WGEM with pin-anodes detection system was constructed. In this paper we present the results of an 
experimental study of these gaseous mixtures exited by an α - source. Mixture of Ar + 40 ppm C2H4 and 
mixture 50% Xe + 50%CF4 have been investigated. The spatial distributions of photoelectron clouds 
produced by primary scintillations on α- and β-particle tracks, as well as the distributions of 
photoelectron clouds due to photons from avalanches at the pin-anode, have been measured for the 
first time.  

In our experiments as another filling of the chambers for search of low-mas WIMP (<10 GeV/c2), 

solar neutrino and solar axions with spin-dependent interaction we propose to use the mixtures:  D2 + 
3ppmTMAE, 3He + 3%CH4, 21Ne + 10%H2, at pressure 10-17 bar. And in our experiment with liquid 
mixtures is used the mixtures with 19F (LXe + CF4) and mixture with 1H (LCH4 + 40ppm TMAE).  

The time projection chamber (TPC) with the mixture D2 + 3ppmTMAE filling at a pressure 10 bar 
allow to search of spin-dependent interactions of solar axions and deuterium (section 8). As well as we 
present the detecting systems for search of narrow pp-resonances (quarks) in accelerators experiments 
(section 9).   

Finally, we discuss principles of operation of GEMs with pin-anodes as well as plans for 

constructing of large scale (150 mm x 150 mm) MGEM detectors.

1. Introduction 

More than forty years ago G. Charpak and F. Sauli have introduced their Multi-Step Chambers to 

overcome limitations of gain in Parallel-Plate and Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) [1, 2]. 
These MWPCs have revolutionized detection systems in high energy physics. 

Currently there are different types of detectors for fast detection and localization of charged 

particles exist. One of them is a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). A standard Gas Electron Multiplier [2,3,4] 
consists of a thin composite sheet (plate) with two metal layers separated by a thin insulator and 
pierced by a regular matrix of open channels. These plates contain through holes on all their area, 
separation distances and diameters of which are approximately equal to the plate thickness (Fig.1a). 
Inside these holes, which are filled with corresponding gases, in presence of strong electric fields, a 
multiplication of electrons takes place. GEMs provide the best spatial resolution and higher rate than 
the wire chambers (MWPC). More coarse macro-patterned detectors are thick-GEMs (THGEM) [5, 6, 7] 
or patterned resistive thick GEM devices (RETGEM) [8].  

However, the most essential disadvantage of GEMs consists in their low reliability and stability. 

The matter is that in a process of dispersion of the GEM’s cathode electrodes by positive ions of 
proportional avalanches in GEM with metal or high-resistive electrodes (RETGEM). The sedimentation of 
the sprayed carrying-out material on the walls of holes with subsequent leaks and breakdowns between 
electrodes takes place. It leads to subsequent decrease of the potential difference between GEM’s 
electrodes and corresponding reduction of the multiplication factor in an avalanche (Fig.1b). 

Micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGD), due to their tiny electrode structure and small 

avalanche gaps (Fig.1c), are very fragile and can be easily damaged by sparks appearing at high 
operational gains (typically at gains of 104 or slightly more) [7]. 

Therefore, we were concentrated on development of more robust designs of GEM detectors 

with wire (WGEM) or metal electrodes (MGEM). The idea of WGEM without plastic insulators was first 
mentioned in our work [9-12]. In our subsequent works [13] a MGEM with metal electrodes of diameter 
of 22 mm was designed and tested. In the paper [14] we have described a novel concept of MGEMs.]. In 
our next works [15-18, 21, 25] it was suggested that the search for spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon 
interactions with help of detecting system GEM + pin-anodes can be performed.

detectors (MPGD). The sedimentation of the sprayed carrying-out material on the walls of holes 
(insulators) with subsequent leaks and breakdowns between electrodes takes place (b, c). 

2. GEMs with wire electrodes (WGEM) 

 In our works [9-12] WGEMs with wire electrodes and no plastic insulators between 

them were created. The WGEMs [9] used macroscopic windows of size 1 mm by 1 mm, while 
WGEMs [10-12] used windows of size 0,5 mm by 0,5 mm.  The gap between the wire electrodes 
was equal to 1 mm. The design of wire GEMs and the results of their tests are shown in Fig.2 
and Fig.3.

3. GEM with metal electrodes (MGEM) 

  In the work [12] a MGEM with metal electrodes and sensitive area of 22 mm by 22 mm for the 
first time was demonstrated. The electrodes were made by drilling of 1 mm holes with a step between 
them of 1.5 mm in to 1 mm thick brass plates (see Fig.4). One disadvantage of that MGEM [13] is large 
duration of the process of drilling the holes in the electrodes, especially for a case of small diameters 
and small steps between holes. In addition to that, formation of agnails at the edges of holes in a 
process of drilling is possible. Another problem of drilling of holes with drilling machines consists in 
difficulty of production of large area MGEM electrodes with high accuracy of sizes of holes and their 
positions on various plates.

4. MGEM with the etching of holes 

In the work [14] the gas electron multiplier with metal electrodes (MGEM), differing by its 
simplicity, high precision and technological effectiveness in production, as well as reliability and stability 
of its operation, is made and tested. To eliminate certain specific shortcomings (see Introduction), in this 
work metal electrodes were made by a method of drawing a mask on 0.3 mm thick brass plates with 0.3 
mm diameter holes and 0.5 mm step between them (fig.5) with subsequent double-side etching of the 
holes. 

As far as the initial brass plate was cut from 0.3 mm thick rolled foil, the produced electrodes 

had a curved shape. Therefore, at assembling, between the MGEM electrodes a fluoroplastic spacer was 
introduced to increase resistance on the pass of leakage charges between the electrodes. From the 
outer sides both electrodes were pressed to fluoroplastic plate by additional steel rings of 2 mm 
thickness.  

 
 
 
 By means of central 4 mm holes in electrodes and special insulating bolts, the GEM electrodes 

were mutually positioned in such a way that the relative displacements of holes didn’t exceed 0.02 mm. 
The gap between electrodes was chosen to be equal to 1 mm.  In this design a sensitive area GEM with 
holes had a diameter of D=75 mm. The GEM was tested in the chamber (Fig.6.) with various filling gases: 
Ar +10%C2H4 (1 and 0.4 bar), Ne +((O2 +N2 +H2O)∙10-6)(1 and 0.4 bar), Ar +10% CH4 (1 bar).     

The results of tests at irradiation of the drift gap of the chamber by alpha-particles (Pu239 ) are 

presented in Fig.5. It is visible, that Ne provides the maximum coefficient of multiplication at the 
smallest potential difference between electrodes before the breakdown happens.

5. The detecting chambers with system GEM + pin-anodes for direct detection of WIMP. 

In work [15] the idea of focusing screen with holes + system pin-anodes already was shown 

(section 5.1). The wire gas electron multipliers in combination with pin-anodes are proposed for 
detection of events:  

(1)  In the gas phase of a double-phase argon chamber (section 5.2);  
(2)  In chamber for direct detection of WIMP with mass ≤ 0.5 GeV/c2 (section 5.4);  
(3)  In chamber with gas mixture H2(D2) + 3ppm TMAE for direct detection of WIMP with 

mass ≤ 10 GeV/c2 and solar axions (section 5.5); 

(4)  In double-phase chambers with LXe + CF4  and LCH4 + TMAE filling (section 7). 
(5)  And, in scintillation and ionization fast chambers with mixture Xe + CF4 for accelerators 

experiments (section 9). 

In the time projection chamber (TPC) with the mixture D2 + 3ppmTMAE filling we use of two-

step system GEM + MWPC (section 8). 

5.1 A liquid-methane ionization chamber  

A liquid-methane ionization chamber with a system of focusing screen + pin-anodes is proposed 

as a setup to search for spin-dependent interactions of DM particles [15]. The anode of the chamber is 
placed in gaseous methane above liquid methane. The anode consists of a system of pins. The Focusing 
screen is placed between the Anode and liquid methane. The screen has a system of holes concentrically 
on the relevant pin-anode. The values of electrical potentials on the electrodes of the chamber are set in 
such a way that all electrical lines of force are focused on the pin-anodes. We provide only the idea of 
using a specially designed liquid-methane ionization chamber in an experiment aimed at searching for 
the (mostly) low mass DM based on their spin-dependent interactions (see section 7.2). 

5.2 Double-phase argon chamber 

Multichannel WGEM + system pin-anodes are proposed for detection of events in the gas phase 
of a double-phase argon chamber [16, 17]. Hydrogen with a concentration of 10 % is added to argon to 
eliminate feedbacks via photons emitted by excited argon molecules in avalanche development 
processes during detection of events in the gaseous argon. A maximum electron multiplication 
coefficient of ∼300 has been obtained for the multichannel wire gas electron multipliers with a 1 mm 
gap used to detect α-particles in the Ar + 10% H2 mixture at a pressure of 1 bar. When a pin anode is 
used, the maximum electron multiplication factor for α-particles is ∼2.5 × 105. It has been 
experimentally shown that adding H2 with a concentration of 100 ppm to liquid argon has no effect on 
the singlet component of the scintillation signal in the liquid argon and reduces the emission efficiency 
relative to the pure argon gas phase only slightly (by 20%).  

 
 
 
 
 
5.3. A method for background reduction in experiments for direct detection of WIMPs. 

To suppress the β, γ and n0 backgrounds, we proposed [18] a addition in liquid argon of 
photosensitive dopants and a comparison of scintillation (S1) and ionization signals (S2) for every event 
is suggested. The addition in liquid Ar of photosensitive TMA, TMG or C2H4 [19] and suppression of 
triplet component of scintillation signals ensures the detection of scintillation signals with high efficiency 
and provides a complete suppression of the electron background.  

In work [20] we investigated of scintillation (S1) and ionization signals (S2) on a mixture of Ar + 

40ppm С2Н4 at a pressure of 5 bar. 

The measurements were taken inside the chamber similar a chamber with pin-anode (see Fig. 5 

left). The mixture was irradiated with α (239Pu) and β (63Ni) particles. The chamber was used with 
potentials of pin-anode Va = 1300 V, Kamp ~104 (β) and Va = 520V, Kamp = 30 (α).  

Peak S1 is associated with the cloud of photoelectrons from the chamber volume due to 

scintillation photons with λ = 128 nm, which are emitted upon excitation of argon atoms with α(β) 
particles: hν + C2H4 → C2H4* + e–. Peak S2 is due to ionization electrons from α(β) particles (Fig. 5). Peak 
S2 fluctuates in the amplitude for different events, since the β-particle spectrum lies in the range of Emin 
- Emax (17 - 67 KeV). Peak S3 can be attributed to the cloud of photoelectrons from the chamber 
volume produced by photons from avalanches at the pin-anode. 

The results obtained in our study suggest that it is possible to develop large volume detectors 

capable of detecting scintillations with a 100% geometrical efficiency, by contrast to the well known 
detection techniques based on photomultipliers having efficiency of only a few percent [27]. 

Fig. 5. The chamber filled with the mixture of Ar + 40ppm С2Н4 at a pressure of 5 bar. The mixture was 
irradiated with α (239Pu) and β (63Ni) particles. The chamber was used in potentials of pin-anode Va = 
1300 V, Kamp ~104(β-particles) and Va = 520V, Kamp = 30 (α-particles). –Vc = 0V. 

5.4 The chamber for direct detection of WIMP with mass ≤ 0.5 GeV/c2. 

The detectors with pure NaI, Xe or Ar [24, 31] make it possible to search WIMPs with large 

masses (up to dozens or hundreds GeV), as far as the energy of nuclear recoils in these detectors from 
low mass WIMPs is low. To account for yearly modulation effect in DAMA-LIBRA experiment [28, 29] 

 
 
 
 
J.Va’vra has supposed [31] that this effect is explained by low mass WIMP scattered at protons in H2O 
molecules, which is contained in NaI crystals at about 1ppm level (see Table 1.) 

The chamber for direct detection of WIMP with mass ≤ 0.5 GeV/c2 was developed [21]. The 

chamber (see Fig.7) is filled with gas mixture Ne+10% Hydrogen +0,15ppm TMG. In this chamber for the 
events detection it was used a system GEM +pin-anodes, which provide the energy threshold about eV. 
The electron background is suppressed due to photosensitive addition of TMG. For a direct detection of 
WIMP it is proposed to use a liquid argon chamber with Hydrogen dissolved in liquid argon at a 
concentration 100ppm+0,015ppm TMG. Based on the work [22], where in a spherical proportional 
detector the energy threshold is about 100eV, while the amplification factor of the detecting system   is 
about 104, we estimate the threshold of our experiment to be about   ̴100 eV∙104/5∙107  < 1eV. The H2-
filling provides an efficient suppression of the electron background, because of the short track of recoil 
protons, compared to the one from background electrons [30]. As another filling of the chamber is used 
the mixture 21Ne+10%deuterium (D2) for search of spin-dependent interaction [23, 35, 36].

detection system (Fig.8). Coefficient of electron multiplication as a function of the anode voltage. The 
chamber is filled with a mixture of Ne+10%H2 at a pressure of 1 bar is exposed to α particles. 

5. The study of system GEM + pin-anode for search for low-mass WIMP and solar axions. 

In our work [25] the chamber for direct detection of WIMPs with mass < 10 Gev/c2 and axions, 

emitted from the Sun, was developed.  For searching the solar axions is used of mixture D2 + 3 ppm 
TMAE in this experiment. The chamber is filled with a gas mixture H2 +3ppm TMAE (5, 10 bar), or D2 + 
3ppm TMAE (5, 10 bar). These gas fillings allow to suppress the electron background [18]. For detection 
of events is used a system GEM + pin-anodes (Fig.8) with coefficient multiplication of about 105 (see 
Fig.9) and the chamber of the previous experiment (Fig.7). Collisions of WIMPs with H2 provide recoil 

  
 
 
 
 
protons with energies of several keV (see Table 1). An addition of TMAE with a low ionization potential 
(5,36 eV) provides detection of recoil protons.   

As another filling of the chamber is used the mixture deuterium (D2) + 3ppm TMAE, 

because:   

(1) the energy of D-recoil is two times more than proton recoil. 

(2) the spin (JS)of nuclear deuterium is equal 1 (the spin of nuclear hydrogen is equal ½) [23]. 

This gives the increase the cross section 3-times as compared with hydrogen. Scattering cross section is 
ϬSD ~ JS∙(JS +1). 

Because the energy of axion is equal to   ̴1 keV [26], is transfers the energy to recoil deuterium. 
The    H2-filling    provides    the    electron    background    suppression, because the recoil protons in H2-
medium have the short track [30], as distinguished from background electrons.

6. Chambers with Xe+CF4 (1:1) gas mixture. 

6.1 Nanosecond timing scintillation chamber with mixture Xe+CF4 filling. The ratio S1/S2 for β 
and α-particles. 

Recently we have investigated a scintillation signal (S1) and a ratio scintillation to ionization 

signal (S1/S2) for β and α-particles on prototype of fast chamber (see Fig.10) with mixture Xe+CF4 (1:1) 
filling at a pressure of 10 bar. This chamber was irradiated with α (239Pu) and β (63Ni) particles. The 
scintillations signals (S1) were measured separately of photomultiplier (PMT-85) with fast shifter (OB-
205). The ionizations signals (S2) were measured on anode of chamber. The addition in Xe of CF4 and 
suppression of long triplet component of signals (27 ns) ensures the detection of scintillation singlet 
signals with high speed (1ns).  

 A shifter OB-205 has a maximum sensitivity range of 185 nm and converts with high efficiency 

of UV-light in visible light (420 nm). And also he have fast luminescence lifetime (∼ 1ns) and high 
photoluminescence quantum yield (99%). The measurements S1 signal used a fast amplifier and an 
oscilloscope Le Croy-232. Electronegative impurities О2, С2F4 and С3F8 were removed from the gases an 
a multistage purification system to a level of 10-8 O2 equivalent (0,01 ppm). The entire system (chamber+ 
gas system) was checked by the "ISTOK" gas analyzer [32] for the presence of known electronegative 
impurities, which were not detected as a result. 

For α-particles, the ratio A=S1/S2 was 0.63 and B=S1/S2 for β-particles 25.The ratio beta to 

alpha was B/A=25/0,63=40.  

 
 
 
Fig.10. Left: prototype of fast chamber with mixture Xe+CF4 (1:1) filling. Right: amplitude of scintillations 
signals (mV), which measured of photomultiplier for α-particles on different gases at pressure 10 bar. U 
   1400V). The potential applied to anode is Va = +400V, the gap of anode 
(V) - voltage of PMT-85 (1000V   
– grid is 8mm.  

For mixture Ar+CF4 (1:1) at a pressure 10 bar, the speed is 3 ns. For mixture Ne+CF4 (1:1) at a 

pressure 10 bar, the speed is 6 ns (see Table 2). The ratio of scintillation signals α-particles to β-particles 
was U(α)/U(β)=2.To get a electron multiplication factor (103) and large electroluminescence signals, the 
chamber instead of a grid is set to WGEM [9].  And to get a large electron multiplication factor (104- 105) 
and large ionization anode signals, the chamber instead of a anode is set to system GEM+pin-anodes 
[16, 17, 21, 25].  

6.2 The chamber with hole + pin-anode with Xe + CF4 filling. The measurements photoelectron 

signals for α and β- particles. 

The measurements were taken in the pin-anode chamber (Fig. 11 left) [20]. The chamber was 
used in two operating modes at cathode potentials Vc = 0 and –500 V. In both cases, cathode C2 was 
grounded. The results obtained thereby are presented in Fig.12. The wide peaks observed when α and β 
events were detected at Vc = 0 can be attributed to clouds of photoelectrons due to primary 
scintillations on particle tracks and to photoelectrons produced by photons from avalanches at the pin 
anode, as well as to ionization electrons from tracks of α and β particles (Fig.12 a). Since the 
concentration of photosensitive  dopant  СF4 was high, all three peaks merged into a single wide peak, 
by contrast to the spectrum from the mixture of Ar + 40 ppm С2Н4 in which these three peaks are 
recorded separately (see section 5.3).  

Apparently, СF4 photoionization takes place in the mixture of Xe+ СF4: hν (Xe2*)→ CF4 → e⁺ + F 
+ CF3⁻. When a negative potential of –500 V is applied to chamber cathode C1, all photoelectrons gather 
on chamber cathode C2, and only ionization electrons from α and β particles are detected at the pin 
anode. Figure 11 (right) present the multiplication factor of ionization electron at the pin-anode in the 
chamber from α and β particles tracks as a function of the anode potential in the mixture Xe+CF4 (1:1) 
at pressures of 1 and 10 bar. In these measurements, voltage Vc = –500 V was applied to cathode C1, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and cathode C2 was grounded. For 1 bar, the maximum electron multiplication factor equal to 3× 104 
was obtained for β particles and Kmax = was obtained for α-particles.  

The use of CF4 dopant in noble gas with the aim of increasing the electron drift velocity was 

described in numerous papers [20]. Our results have demonstrated that CF4 is a photosensitive dopant 
for Xe. As a result, it is possible to detect scintillations in a chamber filled with a mixture of Xe+CF4 with 
a 100% geometrical efficiency, with is required in the experiment of the search for DM in the Universe 
for development of detectors with a high mass and complete suppression of background due to Kr85 and 
external γ-rays.  As well fluorine-19 (19F) has a large spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross-section [35, 36, 
37].

7. Search for spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions.  

7.1 Double-phase xenon chamber with a system GEM +pin-anodes. 

In particle physics, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the generic name given to the 

lightest of the additional hypothetical particles found in supersymmetric models. In models with R-parity 
conservation, the LSP is stable; in other words, it cannot decay into any Standard Model particle, since 
all SM particles have the opposite R-parity. There is extensive observational evidence for an additional 
component of the matter density in the universe, which goes under the name dark matter. The LSP of 
supersymmetric models is a dark matter candidate and is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). 

From the elementary particle physics in the framework of the standard Bing Bang 
nucleosynthesis model one infers that DM consists manly of WIMPs: massive neutrinos, axions and 
particles predicted by SUSY. The most probable candidates for the WIMP are the neutralino, predicted 
by supersymmetric theories (SUSY) [35].  

The direct method for WIMP search consists in detection for their elastic scattering on detector 
2 + 

2 + anWn
nuclei. The WIMP interaction probability in detector can be represented in a form: R = apWp
a0V2, where the first two terms determine the spin-dependent (sd) scattering and the last one is the 
spin-independent (si) scattering [35]. The ratio of the number of spin-dependent  WIMP scattering Rsd 
to the number of spin-independent scattering Rsi can be represent in a form:   

Rsd / Rsi = ɳA∙ ɳSUSY, 

where ɳA is determined by nuclear structure, and ɳSUSY – by neutralino-quark interaction in SUSY 

model. 

The dependence of ɳA from atomic number A for nuclei (1H, 3He, 19F, 73Ge, 127I, 205Tl and others) 

with nonzero spins is shown in Fig. 13a (left) [35]. The dependence  Rsd (A)/ Rsi (Ge73) on neutralino 
mass are shown in Fig. 13a (right) for nuclei 19F and NaI [36]. One can see that more strong restrictions 
on spin-dependent part of WIMP interactions can be obtained in experiment with 19F (CF4, LAr+CF4, 
LXe+CF4) as compared with other nuclei [37]. The measurements are especially attractive in region of 
WIMP mass 8 GeV ≤ mx  ≤ 14 GeV, where Rsd  ˃ Rsi.  

At present time a great experiments [24, 26-28] are carried out for WIMP search with detector 
containing nuclei LAr, LXe, NaJ, Ge, the spin-independent (coherent) scattering for which is large [29]. 
One can see, that sensitivity of these experiments for spin-dependent scattering is 10-100 times less of 
expected effect as distinguished from coherent scattering experiments (see. Fig.13).The proposed in this 
work experiments increases the sensitivity of spin-dependent measurements to the point of the 
expected effect [23]. 

In this context, in our experiments [21, 25, 39] as another filling of the chambers for search of 

low-mas WIMP (<10 GeV/c2) and solar axions with spin-dependent interaction with deuterium (D2), 3He, 
19F and 21Ne we propose to use the mixtures:  21Ne + 10%H2, D2 + 3ppmTMAE, 3He + 3%CH4 at pressure 
10-17 bar. And in our experiments [16-18] with liquid gases mixtures is used the mixtures with 19F: LAr + 
CF4 and LXe + CF4 (see Fig. 14). The relative scintillation light outputs for investigated gases evaluated by 
an distribution area is shown in Table 3.

and NaI [36].

In this section, we describe a double-phase xenon chamber with a system GEM +pin-anodes and 

system of photomultipliers. Fig. 13b shows a design of the chamber. 

To suppress the β, γ and n0 background, we propose a comparison of scintillation singlet signal 
(S1) and ionization signal (S2) for every event is suggested. The addition in Xe of CF4 and suppression of 
long triplet component of signals (27 ns) ensures the detection of scintillation signals with high 
efficiency and provides a complete suppression of the electron background. The singlet component S1 
of the signal (1ns) is determined by the quenching factor (QF) of scintillation signals [47].  

The scintillation intensity at the same particle energy is determined by the ratio 10: 5: 1 for 

electrons, protons and alpha particles [48]. That is, on the tracks of alpha particles, only 10% of their 
energy is spent on the singlet scintillation component. On the contrary, only 10% of the energy of beta 
particles is spent on ionization of the component, and 90% is the singlet scintillation component of the 
signals.  

For alpha particles, the ratio A=S1/S2 was 0.63 and B=S1/S2 for beta particles 25. The ratio beta 

to alpha was B/A=25/0,63=40 for 50%Xe + 50%CF4 gases mixture ( see data of section 6.1 and 6.2). 

 
 
 
 
 
 It is possible that in mixture Xe + CF4 the singlet component of signal (1ns) for beta particles 

with spin (Js=1/2) is due to spin-dependent interaction between beta particles and molecules gases with 
non-zero spin (19F, 129Xe, 131Xe). This assumption is indicated by a comparison of S1 and S2 for mixture 
50%Xe + 50%CF4 and mixture Ar + 40ppm С2Н4 with zero-spin (see section 5.3). In the mixture Ar + 
С2Н4, the average ratio of S1 to S2 does not exceed ten. The long triplet components of the signals are 
suppressed. In general, they do not depend on the spins of the particles, because they are determined 
by long secondary processes. For alpha particles with zero-spin the singlet component of signal (1,5ns) is 
not due to spin-dependent interaction. 

Fig. 13b. Double-phase Xe + CF4 chamber with a system GEM +pin-anodes and photomultipliers. 

The delay time between S1 and S2 is T = 3-300 µs, because: the drift time of electrons is T = 0-

300 µs in LXe + CF4, and the drift time electrons is T = 1-3 µs in gases phase 50%Xe + 50%CF4 [44]. 
Electronegative impurities (О2, С2F4, С3F8, etc.) removed from the gases an a multistage purification 
system to a level of 10-8 O2 equivalent (0,01 ppm). The entire system (chamber+ gas system) is checked 
by the "ISTOK" gas analyzer [32] for the presence of known electronegative impurities.  

7.2 The double-phase chamber with LCH4 + TMAE mixture for search of spin-dependent WIMP-

nucleon interactions.  

In work [46] it is shown that the absolute lower bound for the rate of direct DM detection is due 
to the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interaction, and a new-generation experiment aimed at detecting 
DM with sensitivity higher than 10-5 event/(kg ∙ day) should have a nonzero-spin target to avoid missing 
of the DM signal. In work is claimed that for targets with spin- nonzero nuclei it might be the spin-
dependent interaction that determines the lower bound for the direct detection rate when the cross 
section of the scalar interaction, which is usually assumed to be the dominant part, drops below 10-12-13 
pb particular, from this work one can see that all fluorine-containing targets (LiF, CF4, C2F6, and CaF2, 
etc.) have almost the same sensitivity to both the SD and SI WIMP-nucleus interactions.  

 
 
 
 
 
Among all materials considered a detector with a 73Ge, 129Xe, or NaI target has better prospects 
to confirm or to reject the DAMA result [29] due to the largest values of the lower bounds for the total 
rate R(10, 50) > 0.06 -0.08 events/(kg day). If, for example, one ignores the SI WIMP interaction, then all 
materials have almost the same prospects to detect DM particles with the only exception of CH4 (see 
Fig. 14). The results obtained are based on previous evaluations of the neutralino-proton  (neutron)  spin 
and  scalar  cross  sections  for  the  neutralino  masses  m x  <    200 GeV/c2. 

Fig. 14: a) variations of expected event rates, R (5, 50), for a number of targets followed from the DAMA-
allowed cross sections σSD and σSI.  Targets with nonzero-spin nuclei from the odd-neutron (odd-proton) 
group model are given in the left (right) part of the figure; b) variations of expected spin-independent 
contributions to the event rate, R (5, 50)SI, in a number of targets followed from the DAMA-allowed 
cross sections σSD and σSI; c) the same as in b, but for the spin-dependent contributions R (5, 50)SD 
[46]. 

In this context, in our experiment [15] with liquid CH4 as another filling of the chamber for 
search of low-mas WIMP (<10 GeV/c2) we propose to use the mixture LCH4 + 40ppmTMAE (see Fig. 15).  

Fig. 15. A liquid-methane ionization chamber with a system GEM + pin-anodes for search of spin-

dependent  WIMP-nucleon interactions.  

 
 
The body of the chamber is made of titanium. The cathode-grid of the chamber is immersed in 
liquid methane. The layer of liquid methane above the cathode is equal to 800 mm. The temperature of 
liquid methane is equal to 115 K and the pressure of gaseous methane over the liquid methane is equal 
to 1,3 bar for this temperature. The system GEM + pin-anodes is placed in gaseous methane. The 
addition in liquid CH4 of photosensitive TMAE [19] and suppression of triplet component of scintillation 
signals ensures the detection of scintillation signals with high efficiency and provides a complete 
suppression of the electron background (see section 5.3).  

8. Time-projection chamber with high dE/dz and energy resolutions. 

It is known that multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) used in time-projection chambers 

(TPC) fail to provide good energy resolution [34]. This is mainly due to the fact that multiplication of 
ionization electrons occurs in chamber regions with different electric field intensities resulting in 
variation of the multiplication factor. Additionally, the MWPC features a low dEI/dz resolution in the 
drift direction of the ionization electrons due to slow motion of positive ion clouds from anode wires.  

In our paper [38], we describe a TPC with both high energy and dE/dz resolutions. Fig. 16a shows 

a design of the chamber. The chamber contains the cathode 1 with a 4-mm-diameter collimating 
opening, behind which a 239Pu source with a 105 flow rate is installed at a distance of 10 mm. The rings 
3 provide a uniform drift field. The MWPC 5 used for electron multiplication contains the cathode 
MWPC wound with a 2-mm pitch of a beryllium bronze 100-µm-diameter wire. The anode is winded of a 
20 µm diameter W + Au wire with a 2 mm pitch. The MWPC gap is 2 mm. In projection, the anode wires 
are exactly in the middle between the cathode wires. The chamber contains cathode 6 and anode 7 of 
the measurement gap. The maximum electron multiplication factor for α-particles is ∼ 103. To get the 
total electron multiplication factor (105), the chamber is set to MGEM 4 with the etching of holes [14].  

Due to the photon mechanism, when the avalanche evolves in the anode MWPC wire, an 

electron charge proportional to the initial ionization charge appears in the transfer gap between the 
electrodes 5 and 6. This charge drifts towards the measurement gap between the electrodes 6 and 7. 
Electrodes 6 and 7 are winded of a 100 µm diameter wire with a 1 mm pitch. The width of the gap 5-6 is 
4 mm. The electric field intensity in this gap is insufficient for evolving avalanches and the gap records 
the electrons without multiplication, i.e., in the induction operation mode of the ionization chamber.  

 
 
Fig.16. Design of time projection chamber (TPC) with MWPC and GEM (a), electric field structure 

in the GEM (b), MWPC (c), signals of TPC (d) and daily modulation of signals (e). 

Fig. 16 (b, c) shows the electric field structure in the MWPC and GEM gaps. Since the electric 

field intensity in the MWPC gap is much higher than in the drift gap and due to the symmetric location 
of the cathode relative to the anode wires, the electric field lines, when passing from the drift gap to the 
MWPC gap, concentrate into a narrow beam, which is orthogonal on the average to the anode plane 
and sufficiently uniform. As a result, the electron multiplication occurs in a more homogeneous electric 
field than in usual MWPCs, in which the electric field lines meet the anode wires at different angles in 
different MWPC regions and have different average densities.  

In the process of its evolution, the avalanche discharge involves about 180° of the anode wire in 

the azimuth. In our case, conditions for the evolving discharge are the same for all ionization electrons 
within the drift gap, because the field distributions on all wires are identical, and the fields are more 
homogeneous (see Fig. 16 d, e).  

Since, for usually utilized mixtures, the electron drift speed in the measurement and drift gaps is 
~n∙106 and ~n∙105 cm/s, respectively, and the measurement gap is small, the calculated dE/dz resolution 
referred to the TPC drift gap appears to be sufficiently high: the chamber resolves the track regions or 
separate tracks spaced by ~ 0.2 mm.  

In order to determine the energy resolution and signal structure the chamber was filled with an 

Ar + 0.5% C2H2 + 10%CH4 mixture at a total pressure of 3,5 bar. When recording a-particles from a 
239Pu source, the energy resolution was 8.1% (half-intensity half-width). The front of signals was 2 µsec. 
(Fig.16d).  

Three anode grids with 0,2mm pitch and 0,2mm gaps may be placed in the ionization chamber 
for detection of x, y and 45° x-coordinates. The electrons are moving after multiplication through three 
anode grids inducting on them the signals. The errors for x, y-coordinates will be equal to 0,2mm and 
error for z-coordinate will be 0,2mm (not including diffusion errors).  

 
The method allows you to measure the direction of movement of particles. In our work [45] we 
have study of TPC with the Penning mixture He+3%CH4 filling at a pressure 17 bar for direct detection of 
solar neutrinos. As another filling is use the mixture 3He + 3%CH4 for search of SD-interactions. As well 
time projection chamber with the mixture D2 + 3ppmTMAE filling at a pressure 10-20 bar allow to search 
of spin-dependent interactions of solar axions and deuterium [21, 23, 25]. 

Finally, we compare this chamber with existing multistage avalanche chambers, which also 
provide high energy and dE/dz resolutions and with the MICROMEGAS chambers [7]. The MWPC used in 
our chamber in place of the avalanche chamber allows it to operate under an increased pressure of the 
filling gas (up to 10-20 bar), whereas other chambers are intended for operation mostly at pressures 
lower than the atmospheric pressure. The high resolution (dE/dx, dE/y, dE/z) of the TPC allows you to 
measure the direction of the flow of solar neutrinos and axions. Directionality allows to use only 
electrons recoiling away from the sun, effectively eliminating most background events. 

9. Detecting chamber with system GEM+pin-anodes for search of narrow pp-resonances 
(quarks) at the accelerators in the energy region 150 – 300 MeV. 

The existence of narrow peculiarities in a two-proton system was observed for the first time by 

JINR scientists in nucleon reactions with π-mesons production [40]. By now the statistics has 
substantially been enlarged by this group and narrow pp-peaks at the level 3-5 standard errors have 
proved to be present in various reactions within a wide energy range [41]. Analyzing the effective mass 
distributions in the system of particles np, π- π-, π+ π- from inelastic reactions with π-mesons production 
this group also found the narrow peculiarities, excitation energies of which were just the same as those 
for pp-system. By now this group has observed narrow π- p-resonances which excitation energies 
coincide well with those of pp-systems. In work [42] Y.A.Troyan group has observed the existence of 
narrow pp-resonances in elastic pp-scattering differential cross-section within 116-199 MeV. 

The results are compared with the data of various experiments of elastic scattering at the 

energy region 0,2 - 10 GeV/c2 (Fig. 17). 

The experiment with MPWC which detectors the recoil protons with mixture Xe + iC4H10 (1:1) 

under a pressure 15 torr we proposed in year 1993 to search for narrow pp-resonances (quarks) in the 
energy region 150 – 300 MeV at the MMF accelerator [43]. In the experiment the external proton beam 
of the accelerator is used with the energy changed from 160 MeV to 300 MeV, intensity 2 × 1011 protons 
per second and energy spread  0,5 MeV (FWHM). The formed proton beam goes through the tube filled 
with hydrogen (H2) under a pressure of 5 bar (see Fig.13). Recoil protons from the elastic pp-scattering 
are detected at angles 70° laboratory system for coincidence with gas proportional and scintillation 
detectors. Detectors adsorb the recoil protons with the energies up to 35 MeV. This experiment requires 
high speed of ionization electrons collection time and respectively, the detector resolution time is about 
10-8 sec.  

 
 
 
 
Fig. 17.The results of experiments JINR (Dubna) and MMF (INR, Moscow).  

We propose detect the recoil protons with the energies up to 35 MeV on scintillation chamber  
(see section 6.1) with Xe+CF4 (1:1) filling under a pressure 50 torr and ionization chamber with system 
GEM+pin-anodes under a pressure 15 torr(see Fig.18). Signals are picked up from the scintillation and 
ionization chamber by fast amplifier and then are transferred to coincidence and anticoincidence 
circuits with a resolving time 10-8 sec. When the signal from the scintillation chamber coincides with that 
from the ionization chamber the signal amplitude of the latter is registered by the amplitude analyzer. 
Its readings determine the total number of the events at a certain energy and detection angle (Nevents + 
Nbackgr). The ratio Nevents/Nbackgr is determined an elastic peak against the background. 

Fig.18. Experimental setup with scintillation and ionization chambers. 

We would like to mention that chambers with system MGEM+pin-anodes, as far as the MWPC 

[1] can have many applications for detecting events in high energy physics experiments. 

 
 
 
 
10. Operation principle of MWPC, GEM and system GEM+pin-anode 

The operation principle of Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (a), GEM (b) and system GEM + 

pin-anode (c) is illustrated in Fig.19. The factors which have allowed us to obtain high electron 
multiplication factors in the GEM + pin-anode system are as follows: 

(1) High electric field strength in the system GEM + pin-anode makes it possible to obtain a big 

length of electron avalanche and high value of the electron multiplication factor (106-107); 

(2) Positive ions from the avalanche at the pin are transferred by the electric field, mainly, to the 

walls of the hole in which the pin is located and, in smaller quantities, towards the ionization electrons 
being collected at the pin, which rules out the possibility of streamers being developed at the interface  

(3) For GEM (see technology b) extraction efficiency decrease at low transfer fields values due to 

a worst electron extraction capability from the lower side of the GEM [32];  

(4) Absence of a plastic insulation excludes the emergence of leakage current and spark 

breakdown between electrodes. Accidental spark events in such system don’t lead to their failure as 
positive ions quickly move away from breakdown by a strong electric gap field.  

Fig.19. Operation principle of Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (a), GEM (b) and GEM+pin-

anode (c). Electron avalanches are shown for three technologies (a, b, c); red paths are electron 
trajectories, also the drift of ions is indicated (blue paths). 

The leading edges of the signals picked off the pin-anode are 1-3 µs on different gases and their 
mixtures; however, signal differentiation helps extract the initial parts of the edges 0,2-0,3 µs long. The 
steepness of the pulse leading edges at the pin-anode is determined by the geometry of the pin-hole 
geometry and the potential difference between them. The high electric field strength near the pin-
anode ensures a fast removal of an envelope of positive ions from pin, which, in combination with the 
small gaps between the pin and the walls of the hole-cathode (∼0,4mm), ensures a rapid decrease in 
amplitude of the signal induced at the pin-anode by the positive ion envelope; i.e., it guarantees a high 
steepness of the pulse leading edge (∼1µs). 

 
  
 
 
 We have also plans for constructing of large scale (150mmx150mm) MGEM + pin-anodes 

detectors (see Fig.20).

contains of holes for pin-anodes. The metal electrodes (MGEM) made by a method of drawing a 
mask on brass plates. 

11. Discussion  

In works of CERN the multichannel gas electron multipliers consisting of a plastic plate 50-2000 
microns thick with metal or high-resistive thin (some microns) deposits from two parties are presented 
[2-4].  These GEMs provide the best spatial resolution and higher rate that wire chambers. However, an 
essential disadvantage of these GEM consists in their low reliability and stability. The matter is that at 
cathode dispersion by positive ions from proportional avalanches in GEM with metal or high-resistive 
electrodes there is a sedimentation of the sprayed carrying-out material on walls of holes takes place, 
which leads to subsequent leaks and breakdowns between electrodes.  

In our works we have study the Penning mixtures: He + 3% CH4, Ne + 30%H2, Ar + 10%Xe, Ar + 

10%H2, 50%He + 50%Ne [45] and Ar(Xe) + 20%CF4, LAr(LXe) + 20%CF4 [44]. 

 In this work we propose as another filling of the chambers for search of low-mas WIMP (<10 
GeV/c2) and solar axions on spin-dependent interaction with deuterium (D2), 3He, 19F and 21Ne is used 
the mixtures:  21Ne + 10%H2 [21], D2 + 3ppmTMAE [25], 3He + 3%CH4 [39] at pressure 10-17 bar. And in 
our experiment with liquid mixtures [16-18, 37, 44] is used the mixtures LAr + CF4 (19F) and LXe + CF4 (19F, 
129Xe, 131Xe).  

The time projection chamber [38] with the mixture D2 + 3ppmTMAE filling at a pressure 10 bar 

allow to search of spin-dependent interactions of solar axions and deuterium (section 8). 

In work [46] is claimed that for targets with spin- nonzero nuclei it might be the spin-dependent 
interaction that determines the lower bound for the direct detection rate when the cross section of the 
scalar interaction, which is usually assumed to be the dominant part, drops below 10−12- 10−13 pb. In 
particular, from this work one can see that all fluorine-containing targets (LiF, CF4, C2F6, and CaF2, etc.) 
have almost the same sensitivity to both the SD and SI WIMP-nucleus interactions. Among all materials 
considered a detector with a 73Ge, 129Xe, or NaI target has better prospects to confirm or to reject the 

 
 
DAMA result [29] due to the largest values of the lower bounds for the total rate R(5, 50) > 0.06 -0.08 
events/(kg day). If, for example, one ignores the SI WIMP interaction, then all materials have almost the 
same prospects to detect DM particles with the only exception of CH4. In this context, in our 
experiments [15] with liquid CH4 as another filling of the chamber for search of low-mas WIMP (<10 
GeV/c2) we propose to use the mixtures LCH4 + 40ppmTMAE (section 7.2).  

12. Summary & Outlook 

In our works [9-14] GEMs with wire (WGEM) or metal electrodes (MGEM) and gas gap between 
metal electrodes without plastic were realized. An absence of a plastic insulation between electrodes of 
these GEMs excludes leakage currents and spark breakdowns between the electrodes. 

In our works [16, 17, 21, 25] it was suggested to search low mass WIMPs and solar axions with 

help of chambers with GEMs and systems WGEM (MGEM) + pin-anodes. In work [18] we proposed a 
addition in liquid Xe (Ar) of photosensitive dopants and a comparison of scintillation (S1) and ionization 
signals (S2) for every event is suggested. In our works [15, 25, 37] it was suggested that the search for 
spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions with help of detecting system GEM + pin-anodes can be 
performed. 

In that respect we would like to add the next important comments:  

1. As far as WIMPs with large masses (> 10 GeV) experimentally were not found so far [24, 27, 

29, 31], it is necessary to search the WIMP with small masses (≤ 10 GeV/c2).  

2. The data of the new DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 confirm a peculiar annual modulation of the single-

hit scintillation events in the (2–6) keV energy range (WIMP mass < 10 GeV/c2) satisfying all of the 
multiple requirements of the Dark Matter [29]. J.Va’vra have supposed [31] that this effect is explained 
by low mass WIMP (  ̴1 GeV/c2) scattering on protons in H2O molecules (H+).  

3. In this context, in our experiments [15] with liquid CH4 as filling of the chamber for search of 
low-mas WIMP we propose to use the mixture with 1H (LCH4 + 40ppmTMAE). As well as, it is necessary 
to search of WIMP with small masses (≤ 10 GeV/c2) in spin-dependent interactions between DM 
particles and gases with nonzero-spin nuclei (D2, 3He, 19F, 21Ne, 129Xe, 131Xe) [46].  

Finally, we would like to mention that MGEMs can have various applications in medicine. Such 
MGEMs can be used in different medical instruments for their use in X-ray surgery or Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET), where a high operation stability and reliability of the whole complex of instrument is 
required. Recently we have proposed a PET system, based on these MGEMs and BaF2-crystals [49].
