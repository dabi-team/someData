ABSTRACT

The nature of the icy material accreted by comets during their formation in

the outer regions of the protosolar nebula is a major open question in planetary

science. Some scenarios of comet formation predict that these bodies agglomer-

ated from crystalline ices condensed in the protosolar nebula. Concurrently, al-

ternative scenarios suggest that comets accreted amorphous ice originating from

the interstellar cloud or from the very distant regions of the protosolar neb-

ula. On the basis of existing laboratory and modeling data, we ﬁnd that the

N2/CO and Ar/CO ratios measured in the coma of the Jupiter family comet

67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the ROSINA instrument aboard the European

Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft match those predicted for gases trapped in

clathrates.

If these measurements are representative of the bulk N2/CO and

Ar/CO ratios in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it implies that the ices accreted

by the comet formed in the nebula and do not originate from the interstellar

medium, supporting the idea that the building blocks of outer solar system bod-

ies have been formed from clathrates and possibly from pure crystalline ices.

Moreover, because 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is impoverished in Ar and N2,

the volatile enrichments observed in Jupiter’s atmosphere cannot be explained

solely via the accretion of building blocks with similar compositions and require

an additional delivery source. A potential source may be the accretion of gas

from the nebula that has been progressively enriched in heavy elements due to

photoevaporation.

Introduction

Two main reservoirs of ices have taken part concurrently in the formation of icy

planetesimals in the protosolar nebula (PSN). The ﬁrst reservoir, located in a region within

5 to 30 AU of the Sun, contains ices originating from the interstellar medium (ISM), which,

due to their near solar vicinity, were initially vaporized when they entered the disk (Chick

& Cassen 1997; Mousis et al. 2000). Later, during the cooling of the PSN, water condensed

at ∼150 K in the form of microscopic crystalline ice (Kouchi et al. 1994). Planetesimals

formed in this region of the PSN are believed to have agglomerated from clathrates, as long

as crystalline water was available to form these structures at lower temperatures during

the disk’s cooling (Mousis et al. 2000, 2012; Iro et al. 2003; Lectez et al. 2015). If water

was not suﬃciently abundant, or if the kinetics of clathration was too slow, then pure

crystalline ices may have formed as well. The other reservoir, located at larger heliocentric

distances, is composed of ices that originated from the ISM (Notesco et al. 2003; Bar-Nun

et al. 2007) or from the outermost layers of the disk (Ciesla 2014) and that did not vaporize

when entering into the PSN (Visser et al. 2011). In this reservoir, the frozen water is

amorphous and its porous structure allowed the trapping of other gases (Bar-Nun et al.

1987, 1988, 2007; Bar-Nun & Laufer 2003). Because the location of the boundary between

the two ice reservoirs is poorly determined, it is still unclear from which of the two types of

icy materials Oort Cloud comets (OCCs) and Jupiter Family comets (JFCs) preferentially

accreted. The uncertainty is reinforced by recent dynamical models suggesting that both

OCCs and JFCs could originate from the same parent population, which is the primordial

trans-Neptunian disk located in the ∼10–40 AU region (Brasser & Morbidelli 2013).

The recent N2, CO, and Ar measurements (Rubin et al. 2015; Balsiger et al. 2015)

performed by ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis;

Balsiger et al. 2007) aboard the European cometary space mission Rosetta allowed us to

– 4 –

derive some clues on the nature of the ices accreted by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko

(hereafter 67P/C-G) from the comparison of observations with laboratory and modeling

data. ROSINA measured the two ratios N2/CO and Ar/N2 over a similar time period in

October 20141. The combination of these two determinations, namely (0.17–1.6) × 10−2

for N2/CO and (9.1 ± 0.3) × 10−3 for Ar/N2, allowed the inference of an Ar/CO ratio of

(0.15–1.50) × 10−4 in 67P/C-G. In the following, it is assumed that the bulk N2/CO and

Ar/CO ratios in 67P/C-G are within the inferred ranges of measurements.

2. Comparison with laboratory data and models

Figure 1 shows a comparison between the N2/CO and Ar/CO ratios measured in

67P/C-G, and the same ratios i) sampled from gas trapped in amorphous ice synthesized

in the laboratory at temperatures (24, 27, and 30 K) and deposition rates appropriate

for the ISM (Bar-Nun et al. 2007), ii) calculated in the case where N2, Ar and CO were

crystalized as pure ices in the PSN2 and iii) determined in clathrates via the use of a

statistical thermodynamic model (van der Waals & Platteeuw 1959; Lunine & Stevenson

1985; Sloan & Koh 2008; Mousis et al. 2010) as a function of their formation temperature

(see Appendix for our choice of laboratory data). The amorphous ice has been assumed to

be formed in the laboratory from a gas mixture consisting of H2O:CO:N2:Ar = 100:100:14:1,

a range of values consistent with those estimated for the protosolar nebula (Bar-Nun et

1The N2/CO and Ar/N2 ratios have been measured on October 17–23, 2014 (Rubin et

al. 2015) and October 19–23, 2014 (Balsiger et al. 2015), respectively.

2Because CO and N2 are predicted to be the dominating C– and N– bearing species in

the PSN (Lewis and Prinn 1980), we assume here that CO and N2 are derived from C and

N protosolar abundances (Lodders 2009).

– 5 –

al. 2007). As shown in Figure 1, the N2/CO ratios determined from the experimental

measurements of gas trapping in amorphous water ice are within the range obtained from

ROSINA measurements for 67P/C-G. Meanwhile, the Ar/CO ratios from these experiments

disagree by almost two orders of magnitude with the Ar/CO range for 67P/C-G.

Moreover, trapping in amorphous ice should not match the Ar/CO ratio at higher

deposition temperatures. At the low deposition rate used in these experiments (Bar-Nun et

al. 2007), the amount of trapped gas decreases with increasing temperature, because gases

can escape easier from the amorphous pores at higher thermal energies (Notesco et al. 1999,

2003). Since the trapping eﬃciency of Ar and CO in amorphous ice is coincidentally the

same (Bar-Nun et al. 1987, 1988, 2007; Bar-Nun & Laufer 2003), at higher temperatures

the Ar/CO ratio should remain approximately similar (e.g. 50 K) to those at ∼25 K,

despite of a decrease of the total amount of trapped gas in the amorphous pores. Also, CO

trapping is 20–70 times more eﬃcient than N2 trapping in amorphous ice, as a result of the

weaker bonding of N2 to H2O (Bar-Nun et al. 2007). This diﬀerence, along with the faster

moving molecules at higher temperatures should lead to a lower N2/CO ratio compared to

that at low temperatures. Hence, the amount of N2 relative to CO trapped in amorphous

ice should drop below the range deduced for 67P/C-G at temperatures higher than those

used in laboratory measurements.

On the other hand, the ROSINA measurements are not consistent with the possibility

that N2, Ar and CO only crystallized as pure ices in the PSN. Because these species

condense in the same temperature range in the PSN (∼20–25 K; Mousis et al. 2010),

the N2/CO and Ar/CO ratios are predicted to be quasi-protosolar while they are found

depleted by factors of at least ∼10 and 90 in 67P/C-G’s coma, respectively.

Because of the scarcity of experimental data at low-temperature (20–200 K) and

low-pressure conditions (10−13–10−3 bar), which are typical of those encountered in

– 6 –

planetary environments, and for the sake of comparison with the ROSINA measurements,

we have computed the evolution of clathrate composition along its equilibrium curve at

temperatures corresponding to those met during the cooling of the PSN. Here, clathrates

are assumed to be formed from water ice grains in contact with a gas mixture composed

of CO, N2, and Ar, with CO:N2:Ar = 100:14:1, which is similar to the one used in the

amorphous ice experiments. This mixture corresponds to xCO = 0.87, xN2 = 0.12 and

xAr = 0.01 after normalization. In our calculations, we have assumed the formation of

Structure I clathrate because CO, the dominant species in our mixture, can only occupy

the 51262 cavities present in this structure under typical PSN conditions (Mohammadi et

al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2014). Additionally, N2 and Ar occupy the 512 cavities present in

both clathrate Structures I and II. Our calculations have been performed via the use of a

statistical mechanics model (van der Waals & Platteeuw 1959; Lunine & Stevenson 1985;

Sloan & Koh 2008; Mousis et al. 2010, 2014) that is commonly utilized in the industry and

research. The Kihara parameters for the molecule-water interactions employed in this work

are listed in Table 1 and correspond to ﬁts to existing laboratory experiments.

At a clathrate formation temperature in the ∼44–50 K range in the PSN, the N2/CO

and Ar/CO ratios simultaneously match the 67P/C-G data. This range is narrower than

the one (∼32–70 K) based only on the ROSINA N2/CO determination in 67P/C-G (Lectez

et al. 2015).

3. Discussion

The underlying assumption of our comparison is that the Ar/CO and N2/CO ratios

measured by ROSINA in 67P/C-G’s coma correspond to the bulk abundances in the

nucleus. Additional sources of CO can be neglected since, at the distance of 3 AU

corresponding to the epoch of the measurements, the scale lengths for photodissociation

or electron impact dissociation are several hundred thousand km while the spacecraft was

at ∼8 km from the surface at that time period. By adopting the gas phase composition

proposed by Bar-Nun et al. (2007), our calculations do not take into account the other

molecules that have been detected in 67P/C-G’s coma. Provided that these molecules (such

as CO2, CH4, etc) remain minor compounds compared to CO in the PSN gas phase, their

inclusion in our model would not alter the results. Similar conclusions have been derived

by Bar-Nun & Laufer (2013) in the case of amorphous ice.

Whatever the icy phase from which they derive, Ar, N2 and CO should be released

from layers deeper than the shallow subsurface of the nucleus. Indeed, simulations of

67P/C-G’s interior show that the clathrate layer would be located at a depth of ∼25 m

below the surface after 100 years of heating variation due to orbital evolution while the

destabilization/sublimation interfaces of the amorphous ice and pure ices are located at

minimum depths of ∼10 m and 40 m3 over the same time period, respectively (Mousis et

Based on existing measurements, we show that the N2/CO and Ar/CO ratios observed

in 67P/C-G’s coma are consistent with the possibility that its nucleus agglomerated from

clathrates in the PSN. However, our clathrate composition model simultaneously only ﬁts

the highest Ar/CO ratio and the lowest N2/CO ratio observed in 67P/C-G. Because the

production rates of Ar and N2 are well correlated in 67P/C-G’s coma (Balsiger et al. 2015),

a perfect match of our model with the data would require the simultaneous ﬁts of both

maximum or minimum N2/CO and Ar/CO ratios. To enable this matching, an additional

reservoir of volatiles is needed, which could consist of crystalline ices located deeper than

the clathrate layer or amorphous ice located closer to the surface. The additional release

of N2 from one of these two reservoirs would then make easier the correlation between

the N2/CO and Ar/CO ratios. This points towards a heterogeneity of the type of ices

present in the nucleus, unless the Ar/CO and N2/CO ratios observed in the coma are not

representative of its bulk composition. So far, only geographical heterogeneity has been

discussed (H¨assig et al. 2015; Luspay-Kuti et al. 2015).

The agglomeration of 67P/C-G from clathrates and pure crystalline ices is consistent

with the measurement of its D/H ratio by ROSINA if the comet was assembled from water

ice that crystallized at ∼140–150 K in the PSN subsequently to the isotopic exchange

of D–rich H2O vapor (originating from ISM) with protosolar H2 (Ceccarelli et al. 2014;

Kavelaars et al. 2011; Altwegg et al. 2015). In this picture, clathrates formed later at

cooler disk temperatures (in the ∼40–50 K range as derived from our model) as a result of

the interaction of the water ice grains with CO, N2 and Ar vapors. Volatiles not trapped

in clathrates then remained in the gas phase until the disk cooled enough to allow their

condensation as pure crystalline ices in the ∼20–25 K range (Mousis et al. 2010). Because of

its smaller propensity to be trapped in clathrate compared to CO and its larger abundance

– 9 –

than that of Ar, N2 should be the dominating crystalline ice condensed in the disk. If the

PSN dissipated before cooling down to the condensation temperatures of the remaining

volatiles, then only clathrates were agglomerated by 67P/C-G.

The fact that our comparison points towards the presence of clathrates in 67P/C-G

makes the assumption of coexisting amorphous ice more diﬃcult to defend because the

needed thermodynamic conditions are incompatible with the condensation of crystalline

ices at the formation location of the comet in the PSN. Alternatively, some amorphous

grains may have migrated within the PSN and crystallized prior to agglomeration by

67P/C-G. However, these grains are expected to be almost devoid of volatiles because of

their progressive annealing (Bar-Nun et al. 2007).

If the suggested ice structure of 67P/C-G is typical of that of comets and planetesimals

formed in the outer solar system, this suggests that, at their formation location, the

disk was at some point warm enough to vaporize the ice grains from the ISM as they

entered the PSN (see Figure 2). Our ﬁnding supports current scenarios of giant planet and

satellite formation (Gautier & Hersant 2005; Mousis et al. 2009, 2010, 2014), in which

the agglomeration of building blocks from clathrates and pure crystalline ices formed in

the PSN is needed to explain their current composition. However, if Jupiter accreted from

planetesimals with 67P/C-G-like compositions, this poses the problem of interpreting the

C, N, and Ar abundances in a consistent manner since these species are all enriched ∼3

times compared to protosolar value in Jupiter’s atmosphere (Mousis et al. 2012).

If these species were sourced from 67P/C-G-like icy planetesimals accreted by the

forming planet (Gautier et al. 2001; Mousis et al. 2012, 2014), then matching the carbon

enrichment would imply that nitrogen is moderately enriched (only ∼1.1 times protosolar),

due essentially to the accretion of nebula gas including a quasi protosolar N2 abundance,

and because the average N2/CO ratio in 67P/C-G is depleted by a factor ∼25 compared

– 10 –

to protosolar (Rubin et al. 2015). Also, the amount of Ar supplied to Jupiter by these

solids would be negligible compared to what is needed to match the observations, resulting

in a protosolar Ar abundance in the envelope. This implies that at least CO and Ar

must have been delivered to Jupiter via an additional mechanism, which could be the

accretion gas that has been progressively enriched in heavy elements due to the preferential

photoevaporation of hydrogen and helium from the PSN (Guillot & Hueso 2006).

So far, if one considers the existing ROSINA and laboratory data, the scenario of

67P/C-G agglomeration from clathrates formed in the PSN appears the best explanation

matching the composition of its coma. Future measurements would be needed to ascertain

this theory, with notably the determinations of Kr and Xe abundances in the comet,

which are predicted to be almost protosolar relative to CO and H2O (see Appendix for

details). Unfortunately, due to safety reasons, the spacecraft orbited the comet at much

higher distance than envisaged when it was active at perihelion in August 2015, impeding

ROSINA’s ability to characterize these species. Moreover, the measurements of Kr and Xe

will remain challenging after perihelion due to the activity decrease and their expected low

abundances.

Further laboratory experiments are needed to constrain the equilibrium curves of

clathrates and their kinetics of formation at low pressures. The Kihara parameters used

in our statistical mechanics model derive from ﬁts of experimental data available at much

higher temperatures than those investigated here. Also, the temperature dependence of the

size of cavities is poorly known in clathrates, which may aﬀect their trapping properties.

One potential problem might be also the low formation kinetics of clathrates at nebular

conditions, but planetesimal collisions, which induce localized heating and enhanced

sublimation, may overcome this issue (Lunine & Stevenson 1985). Moreover, the existing

amorphous experiments may not mimic the true formation conditions of cometary grains

– 11 –

if they originate from the ISM in terms of vapor deposit rates. However, only the in

situ sampling of a nucleus by a future space mission will provide deﬁnitive answer to the

question of 67P/C-G’s nature and how it formed in the PSN.

A. Choice of Laboratory Data

The laboratory data of volatile trapping in amorphous ice were chosen as published

in Bar-Nun et al. (2007) for the following reasons. First, the authors used a very low ice

deposition rate in their experiments. Considering the time scale of ∼105–106 yr for ice grain

formation, the low deposition rates considered in this study seem to be more appropriate

for interstellar medium and nebula conditions than deposition rates used in previous

experiments (Bar-Nun et al. 1987, 1988; Bar-Nun & Laufer 2003). Second, this group

considered a gaseous mixture composed of H2O, CO, N2 and Ar in protosolar proportions

(H2O:CO:N2:Ar = 100:100:14:1) prior to amorphous ice formation, which corresponds

to a plausible representation of the gas phase composition that may have existed in the

protosolar nebula. We did not consider the more recent experimental data describing the

composition of amorphous ice formed at 77 K from independent mixtures of X-H2O, with

X = Ar, Kr, Xe, N2, and CO (Yokochi et al. 2012), despite the fact that the authors

provided extrapolation laws allowing to determine the fraction of noble gas trapped at

lower temperatures. These data are irrelevant in our situation because the authors did not

– 12 –

simulate gaseous mixtures including together H2O, CO, N2 and Ar that would represent

a plausible gas phase composition of the protosolar nebula, as in Bar-Nun et al. (2007).

In this case, as illustrated by the data of Bar-Nun et al. (2007), there is a competition

between the trapping of the diﬀerent species in amorphous ice, and the ﬁnal outcome of

this competition is impossible to derive from simple X-H2O mixtures.

B. Prediction of Kr and Xe abundances in 67P/C-G

Our clathrate composition model can also be used to predict the mole fractions of Kr

and Xe trapped in 67P/C-G at its formation epoch. To do so, we considered the same

gaseous mixture as in Sec. 1 to which we added Kr and Xe, assuming that Kr/Ar and

Xe/Ar are in protosolar proportions (Lodders et al. 2009). After normalization, we get xCO

= 0.8696, xN2 = 0.1217, xAr = 0.0087, xKr = 6.16 × 10−6 and xXe = 6.02 × 10−7. Figure 3

represents the mole fractions of CO, N2, Ar, Kr and Xe in clathrates formed at 44 and 50 K

in the protosolar nebula. Because Xe dominates the clathrate composition, this noble gas

should be fully trapped in 67P/C-G, implying Xe/O and Xe/C ratios close to protosolar in

the nucleus. Interestingly, the Kr/C ratio in the considered clathrates is in the 0.06-0.14

range, corresponding to enrichment factors that are 3 to 4 magnitude orders larger than

the coexisting Kr/C gas phase ratio. This also implies that Kr should be fully trapped in

67P/C-G, thus giving Kr/C and Kr/O ratios close to protosolar in the nucleus.
