Abstract  

We examine the history of the loss and replenishment of the Martian atmosphere 
using elemental and isotopic compositions of nitrogen and noble gases. The evolution 
of the atmosphere is calculated by taking into consideration various processes: impact 
erosion  and  replenishment  by  asteroids  and  comets,  atmospheric  escape  induced  by 
solar radiation and wind, volcanic degassing, and gas deposition by interplanetary dust 
particles. Our model reproduces the elemental and isotopic compositions of N and noble 
gases (except for Xe) in the Martian atmosphere, as inferred from exploration missions 
and  analyses  of  Martian  meteorites.  Other  processes  such  as  ionization-induced 
fractionation,  which  are  not  included  in  our  model,  are  likely  to  make  a  large 
contribution  in  producing  the  current  Xe  isotope  composition.  Since  intense  impacts 
during  the  heavy  bombardment  period  greatly  affect  the  atmospheric  mass,  the 
atmospheric  pressure  evolves  stochastically.  Whereas  a  dense  atmosphere  preserves 
primitive isotopic compositions, a thin atmosphere on early Mars is severely influenced 
by  stochastic  impact  events  and  following  escape-induced  fractionation.  The  onset  of 
fractionation  following  the  decrease  in  atmospheric  pressure  is  explained  by  shorter 
timescales  of  isotopic  fractionation  under  a  lower  atmospheric  pressure.  The 
comparison  of  our  numerical  results  with  the  less  fractionated  N  (15N/14N)  and  Ar 
(38Ar/36Ar)  isotope  compositions  of  the  ancient  atmosphere  recorded  in  the  Martian 
meteorite Allan Hills 84001 provides a lower limit of the atmospheric pressure in 4 Ga 
to  preserve  the  primitive  isotopic  compositions.  We  conclude  that  the  atmospheric 
pressure was higher than approximately 0.5 bar at 4 Ga.

1. Introduction  

Whereas present-day Mars has a thin atmosphere (6 mbar on average), ancient 
Mars  probably  had  a  denser  atmosphere.  Geomorphological  evidence  such  as  valley 
networks  and  deltas  on  Mars  requires  repeated  episodes  of  liquid  water  runoff  in  the 
Noachian  period  (e.g.,  Hynek  et  al.  2010).  A  dense  atmosphere  with  a  climate  warm 
enough to sustain liquid water on the Martian surface has been proposed to explain the 
fluvial terrains (e.g., Pollack et al. 1987; Forget and Pierrehumbert 1997; Ramirez et al. 
2014). 

The  idea  of  a  permanent  warm  climate  on  early  Mars  was  questioned;  climate 
models showed that a dense CO2 atmosphere on Mars cannot maintain a mean surface 
temperature  higher  than  the  freezing  point  of  water  (e.g.,  Kasting  1991;  Forget  et  al. 
2013),  and  geochemical  evidence  suggested  that  water  fluvial  activity  was  mostly 
limited to the subsurface (Ehlmann et al. 2011). The ancient Mars might have been cold, 
but  global  atmospheric  circulation  under  a  dense  atmosphere  is  needed  to  transport 
water  to  highlands  by  atmospheric  circulation,  and  consequently  to  create  fluvial 
terrains  by  episodic  melting  events  of  the  ice  on  the  highlands,  even  in  the  cold  early 
Mars scenario (Wordsworth et al. 2013; 2015; Cassanelli and Head 2015). 

The  Martian  atmosphere  would  have  been  lost  and  replenished  by  several 
processes  (Figure  1).  Exploration  missions  and  analyses  of  Martian  meteorites  have 
revealed  that  almost  all  the  volatile  elements  in  the  Martian  atmosphere  and  surficial 
water  are  enriched  in  heavier  isotopes,  which  suggests  that  lighter  isotopes  were 
preferentially  removed  by  atmospheric  escape  induced  by  solar  radiation  and  wind 
(Jakosky  and  Phillips  2001).  In  addition,  impacts  of  asteroids  and  comets  erode  and 
replenish the atmosphere (Melosh and Vickery 1989; Zahnle 1993; de Niem et al. 2012). 
Volcanic degassing (Craddock and Greeley 2009) and gas deposition by interplanetary 
dust particles (IDPs) (Flynn 1997) would have contributed to the replenishment of the 
atmosphere.  Although 
the  escape/replenishment  processes  are  not  completely 
understood,  the  geological  evidence  mentioned  above  suggests  a  net  decrease  in  the 
atmospheric pressure throughout the Martian history. 

Elemental and isotopic compositions of the atmosphere have been used to trace 
the history of the Martian atmosphere in literature (Jakosky 1991; Jakosky et al. 1994; 
Pepin  1991;  1994;  Jakosky  and  Jones  1997;  Zahnle  1993;  Slipski  and  Jakosky  2016). 
Out of these, Jakosky et al. (1994) and Pepin (1994) are the most comprehensive studies 
that  examined  the  evolution  of  the  Martian  atmosphere,  taking  atmospheric  escape 
induced  by  solar  radiation  and  wind,  impact  erosion,  and  volcanic  degassing  into 
account. They concluded that the fractionated isotopic compositions of N, Ne, and Ar in 
the  Martian  atmosphere  are  explained  by 
the  escape  and 
replenishment  by  volcanic  degassing.  Contrary  to  the  unfractionated  Kr  isotopes,  the 
fractionated  Xe  was  suggested  to  be  the  remnants  of  a  hydrogen-rich  primordial 
atmosphere lost by hydrodynamic escape at the earliest stage of the Martian evolution 
(Pepin 1994).

Whereas these comprehensive studies are suggestive to constrain the evolution 
of the Martian atmosphere, recent isotopic measurements of the Martian atmosphere by 
Curiosity (Atreya et al. 2013; Wong et al. 2013) and analyses of the Martian meteorites 
(Mathew  and  Marti  2001)  provided  new  data  that  can  be  compared  with  model 
calculations. In particular, 15N/14N and 38Ar/36Ar ratios of the early atmosphere recorded 
in  Martian  meteorite  Allan  Hills  (ALH)  84001  (Mathew  and  Marti  2001)  are  used  to 
constrain  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  early  Mars  at  4.1  Ga  (the  crystallization  age  of 
ALH 84001, Bouvier et al. 2009; Lapen et al. 2010) in this study. 

We constrain the atmospheric pressure on early Mars by combining a numerical 
model and isotopic data recently obtained from exploration missions and from analyses 
of Martian meteorites. Our numerical model is explained in Section 2. In Section 3, we 
calibrate  input  parameters  to  reproduce  the  elemental  and  isotopic  composition  of  the 
present-day  atmosphere  and  show  a  constraint  on  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  early 
Mars  by  comparing  the  numerical  results  with  the  isotopic  data.  The  evolution  of  the 
Martian  surface  environment  is  discussed  in  Section  4.  Finally,  we  conclude  that  the 
atmospheric pressure was higher than ~0.5 bar at 4 Ga in Section 5. 

2. Model  

We  constructed  a  one-box  atmosphere-hydrosphere/cryosphere  model 
containing multiple species: CO2, N2, H2O, and noble gases (Figure 1). We calculated 
the  evolution  of  the  elemental  and  isotopic  compositions  of  the  Martian  atmosphere, 
taking  into  consideration  the  escape  and  replenishment  processes:  impact  erosion  and 
replenishment by asteroids and comets, atmospheric escape induced by solar radiation 
and wind, volcanic degassing, and gas deposition by IDPs.  

2.1. Climate model and phase equilibrium 

Phase  equilibrium  of  CO2  and  H2O  between  the  atmospheric  and  solid/liquid 
reservoirs is treated in our model. The Martian atmosphere exchanges CO2 with other 
CO2  reservoirs  on  the  surface:  ice  caps  and  regolith  (Gierasch  and  Toon  1973). 
Depending on the atmospheric pressure, the atmosphere can collapse to form large polar 
CO2 ice caps because of the instability (Haberle et al. 1994; Kurahashi-Nakamura and 
Tajika 2006). Recent three-dimensional global-circulation-model simulations (Forget et 
al. 2013) showed that CO2 ice caps are formed when the surface pressure is higher than 
3  bar.  There  is  another  threshold  at  lower  atmospheric  pressure;  if  the  atmosphere  is 
thinner than this threshold, the atmosphere collapses to form large CO2 ice caps. This 
threshold value depends on the obliquity of Mars (Nakamura and Tajika 2003; Forget et 
al.  2013).  The  Martian  obliquity  is  chaotic  in  the  timescale  of  Myrs,  at  least  for  the 
current condition (Laskar et al. 2004)1. A threshold of the atmospheric collapse, Pcollapse 
= 0.5 bar, was assumed in most of our model by following the maximum value obtained 
by Forget et al. 2013. Since CO2 is the dominant species in the Martian atmosphere, the

planets in the Nice model (Ramon and Walsh 2011)

abundances of N and noble gases in the atmosphere would increase significantly after 
the collapse, which leads to the following escape-induced fractionation (Jakosky et al. 
1994;  Pepin  1994,  Section  3).  We  will  also  show  the  case  without  the  atmospheric 
collapse in subsection 3.2. 

Water vapor is another condensation component in the Martian atmosphere. The 

atmospheric H2O pressure pH2O is given by,  

pH2O=exp 9.550426-

5723.265

T

+3.53068  ln T -0.00728332 T 				[Pa]             (1) 

where 𝑇 is the temperature (Murphy and Koop 2005). We assume 𝑇	 = 	273.16	K (H2O 
triple  point)  considering  a  possible  warmer  climate  and  𝑇	 = 	210	K  (mean  surface 
temperature on present-day Mars, e.g., Barlow 2008) before and after the collapse. Our 
model  is  simplified  by  employing  a  constant  value  for pH2O;  in  reality,  the  amount  of 
water vapor in the atmosphere varies as a function of the obliquity (Mellon and Jakosky 
1995; Mellon and Phillips 2001). We have done sensitivity analyses and found that the 
effect of pH2O on the atmospheric evolution is minor, as long as the abundance of water 
vapor is lower than 1%. The atmospheric CO2 pressure after the collapse is controlled 
by  surface  CO2  reservoirs  and  is  assumed  to  be  6  mbar  (mean  surface  pressure  on 
present-day Mars, e.g., Jakosky and Phillips 2001). We note that carbonate formation is 
not included in our model, but we discuss its influence in Section 4. 

2.2. Impacts of asteroids and comets 

The  impacts  of  asteroids  and  comets  both  remove  and  replenish  atmospheric 
volatiles  (Pham  et  al.  2009;  2012;  de  Niem  et  al.  2012).  A  Monte  Carlo  method 
(Kurosawa  2015)  was  used  to  treat  the  stochastic  nature  of  impacts  in  our  model  by 
assuming  the  total  mass  of  the  impactors,  size  distribution,  velocity  distribution,  and 
impact  flux.  The  Mersenne  Twister  algorithm  (Matsumoto  and  Nishimura  1998)  was 
used in the Monte Carlo calculation.  

Atmospheric loss and volatile delivery of each impact are calculated by adapting 
empirical  formulas  obtained  by  the  recent  numerical  simulations  (Shuvalov  2009). 
Since  the  total  volatile  abundance  in  an  asteroid  depends  on  the  asteroidal  types 
(Wasson and Kallemeyn 1988), it is treated as a parameter 𝑋123 (defined by the ratio of 
the  degassed  CO2  mass  to  the  total  mass  of  the  asteroid).  We  used  𝑋123 = 10% 
(carbonaceous  chondrite-like)  and  1%  (enstatite  chondrite-like)  based  on  the  carbon 
content of meteorites (Wasson and Kallemeyn 1988). The masses of other volatiles are 
calculated  by  assuming  that  the  relative  abundances  to  C  are  chondritic  (Figure  2). 
Some  scenarios  predict  cometary  impacts  during  the  late  heavy  bombardment  (LHB) 
period (e.g., Gomes et al. 2005). We treated the ratio of comets to asteroids after 4.1 Ga 
(see the next paragraph) as a parameter 𝑓6789: (the number ratio of comets to asteroids 
in  the  impactors).  We  calculated  the  cases  of 𝑓6789: = 0%, 0.1%,  and 1%.  It  will  be 
shown  that 𝑓6789: should  be  less  than  1%  to  reproduce  the  abundances  of  noble  gases 
on the present-day Mars (Section 3).

We assumed the total mass of impactors to be 2 × 1021 kg, which was estimated 
by  assuming  that  the  Martian  mantle  abundances  of  the  highly  siderophile  elements 
(HSEs)  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Earth’s  mantle  (Bottke  et  al.  2010).  The  size 
distribution  of  the  impactors  was  assumed  to  follow  the  power  laws  (dN/dD  ∝  D-q, 
where  N  is  the  cumulative  number  of  the  impactors  and  D  is  the  diameter  of  the 
impactor). We assumed q = 2 for large impactors (D > 300 km), which is estimated to 
reproduce the mantle abundances of HSEs in Earth and the Moon (Bottke et al. 2010), 
and  q  =  3.5  for  small  impactors  (D  <  300  km),  which  is  the  value  expected  from  the 
collisional cascade (Tanaka et al. 1996) as shown in Figure 3a. The velocity distribution 
of the impactors is adapted from that of the asteroid belt (rescaled to the impact on Mars 
from Ito and Malhotra 2006, Figure 3b). We first calculated the total number of impacts 
from the assumed total mass and size distribution. Impact flux as a function of the time 
was then obtained from the calculated total number of impacts and a crater chronology 
model (Morbidelli et al. 2012). We note that the timing of the LHB was assumed at ~ 
4.1  Ga  in  the  chronology  model.  Impacts  are  mostly  concentrated  prior  to  4  Ga  (so-
called late accretion, which includes the LHB). 

We adopted empirical formulas for the loss of the atmospheric mass	𝛥	𝑚2:8 and 
the  projectile  mass  𝛥𝑚>?  shown  by  Shuvalov  (2009).  The  net  loss  (gain)  of  an 
atmospheric species “i"  is written as, 𝛥𝑚@ = 𝑋A,2:8𝛥𝑚2:8 + 𝑋A,>?(𝑚>? − 𝛥𝑚>?), where 
𝑚>? and 𝑚2:8 are the masses of the projectile (impactor) and atmosphere, and 𝑋A,>? and 
𝑋A,2:8 are the mass abundances in the projectile and atmosphere. The loss and gain are 
described using a dimensionless variable ξ,

The  volatile  abundances  in  asteroids  and  comets  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  volatile 
abundance  in  chondrites  depends  on  the  chondrite  types.  We  assumed  the  relative 
abundance  (the  ratio  of  N  and  noble  gases  to  C)  of  CI  chondrites.  Then  the  absolute 
abundances of volatiles in asteroids are determined by a parameter 𝑋123. The noble gas 
abundance in comets is taken from Dauphas (2003) (the 50 K model in their Table 1). 
The C and N abundances are then estimated by assuming the solar C/Ar and C/Ar ratios 
by  following  the  assumption  used  in  Marty  and  Meibom  (2007).  We  will  show  that 
noble  gases  in  the  Martian  atmosphere  are  mostly  supplied  from  comets  and  IDPs 
(Section 3). 

2.3. Sputtering 

Oxygen atoms in the upper atmosphere are ionized by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) 
photons,  electron  impacts,  or  charge  exchange.  The  O+  ions  are  picked  up  by  the 
magnetic field of the solar wind. The picked-up ions re-impact the particles in the upper 
atmosphere  because  their  gyration  radii  are  comparable  with  the  size  of  Mars.  These 
ions sputter atmospheric molecules and atoms away (e.g., Luhmann et al. 1992).  

Sputtering  followed  the  model  used  in  Jakosky  et  al.  (1994)  and  Pepin  (1994) 
tot calculated by the CO2 + O 
with some modifications. The CO2 sputtering rate FCO2, sp
exobase model (Luhmann et al. 1992) for 1, 3, and 6 times present-day EUV flux was 
adapted by interpolating and extrapolating as a function of time. The sputtering rate of

homopause, Rdiff, i/CO2  is  the  fractionation  factor  by  diffusive  separation  between  the 
homopause  and  exobase,  and  the  dimensionless  factor  α  is  defined  by  α≡
Rdiff, i/CO2, which denotes the summation of the mixing ratios at the exobase. The

Rdiff, i/j=exp(-𝛥mi,jg𝛥z/kBT),         (7) 

where 𝛥𝑚A,S is the mass difference between two species (j is CO2 for Rdiff, i/CO2), g is the 
gravitational  acceleration,   𝛥z is  the  distance  between  homopause  and  exobase,  and kB 
is  the  Boltzmann  constant.  We  adopted  the  yields  calculated  by  Monte  Carlo  particle 
simulations for N, Ne, and Ar (Table 1, Jakosky et al. 1994). Because the yields of Kr 
and Xe were not provided in Jakosky et al. (1994), these values were estimated from an 
analytical formula shown by Johnson (1992) (Table 1). We note that the CO2 sputtering 
rate  in  our  multiple  component  model FCO2, sp is  not  identical  to  that  obtained  by  the 
tot )  because  of  the  factor 1/α which  denotes  the 
CO2  +  O  exobase  model  (FCO2, sp
dilution effect by other species.

The  time  dependence  of  the  solar  EUV  flux  and  the  model  of  the  upper 
atmosphere  were  updated  from  the  model  of  Jakosky  et  al.  (1994)  and  Pepin  (1994). 
The  model  of  the  EUV  flux  obtained  from  observations  of  solar  proxies  in  different 
ages  (Ribas  et  al.  2005)  was  used.  The  saturation  phase  was  assumed  for  the  first  0.1 
billion years (Jackson et al. 2012) of the solar evolution (the first 0.04 billion years in 
our  calculation).  We  adopted  the  upper  atmospheric  structures  under  different  EUV 
levels for 𝛥z/T (Terada et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 1993; Jakosky et al. 1994, Table 2) and 
interpolated through time. 

A global magnetic field produced by ancient Martian dynamo might prevent the 
atmosphere from being sputtered (Jakosky and Phillips, 2001). The magnetic signatures 
of impact basins on Mars suggest that the dynamo ceased at ~ 4.1 Ga (Lillis et al. 2008). 
We  assumed  two  end  members.  The  sputtering  is  assumed  to  operate  from  4.1  Ga  in 
most of our models. The case where the sputtering operated from the beginning of our 
calculation will be discussed in Section 4. 

2.4. Photochemical escape 

recombination,  electron 

Nitrogen  escapes  from  the  upper  atmosphere  by  photochemical  processes 
including  photodissociation,  photodissociative 
impact 
dissociative ionization, dissociative recombination, and ion-molecule reactions (Fox and 
Dalgarno  1983;  Fox  1993).  Photochemical  escape  of  N  followed  the  model  used  in 
Jakosky et al. (1994) and Pepin (1994) with some modifications: the time dependence 
of  the  solar  EUV  flux  (subsection  2.3)  and  the  fractionation  factor.  The  escape  rate 
depends  on  the  N2/CO2  mixing  ratio  and  solar  EUV  flux.  The  dependence  on  the 
N2/CO2 mixing ratio was taken from Fox and Dalgarno (1983). The dependence on the 
EUV flux FEUV was assumed by following the discussion of Jakosky et al. (1994): the 
escape  rates  by  molecule-photon  and  molecule-electron  reactions  (photodissociation, 
photodissociative 
ionization,  and 
dissociative  recombination)  are  proportional  to 𝐹WXY  (Fox  and  Dargarno,  1983;  Fox 
1993) and the escape rates by ion-molecule reactions are proportional to𝐹WXY

Carbon is also removed from the upper atmosphere by photochemical processes 
including  photodissociation  of  CO  and  dissociative  recombination  of  CO+  and  CO2
+ 
(Groeller et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2015), which are included in our model as a mechanism 
of  CO2  loss.  The  model  used  in  Hu  et  al.  (2015)  was  adopted  in  our  model.  The 
photochemical escape rate Fc,ph is given by,  

Fc,ph=7.9×1023FLyc

β				[s-1],         (8) 

where FLyc  is  the  solar  Lyman  continuum  flux  in  units  of  the  current  solar  Lyman 
continuum  flux  ( FLyc∝t-0.86,  where t is  the  time)  and β is  the  power-law  index.  The 
index β was treated as a parameter in Hu et al. (2015). We show the cases of β	=	1 in 
the  following  sections,  but  the  results  do  not  depend  on  the  assumption  because  the 
influence of the photochemical escape on the evolution of the atmospheric pressure is 
minor.

2.5. Volcanic degassing 

A  volatile  supply  by  volcanic  degassing  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  major 
processes of the atmospheric replenishment through Martian history. The dependence of 
the degassing rate on time was taken from Craddock and Greeley (2009), which is based 
on  geologic  records  of  volcanism  on  Mars.  Craddock  and  Greeley  (2009)  showed  the 
minimum  estimate  of  the  gases  released  into  the  atmosphere  by  using  the  volatile 
abundance of Earth’s basaltic eruptions. The degassing composition is shown in Figure 
2.  The  model  of  Craddock  and  Greeley  (2009)  was  adopted  for  CO2,  H2O,  and  N2 
(Figure  4).  We  estimated  the  abundance  of  the  noble  gases  in  the  volcanic  gas  by 
assuming  their  ratios  to  (C+N)  to  be  identical  to  those  of  the  Earth’s  depleted  mantle 
(Marty  2012).  The  cumulative  amount  of  degassed  CO2  during  the  Martian  history 
corresponds  to  0.4  bar  in  the  Craddock  and  Greeley  (2009)  model.  We  introduce  the 
volcanic  factor  𝐶]7^ ,  which  is  a  multiplicative  factor  that  accounts  for  a  different 
volcanic rate, and is the same approach employed by Slipski and Jakosky (2016). We 
calculated  the  cases  of 𝐶]7^ = 1, 3, 5.  We  will  show  that  the  volcanic  degassing  is  a 
major  source  of  N  in  the  Martian  atmosphere,  whereas  the  noble  gases  mostly 
originated from comets and IDPs (Section 3). 

2.6. Gas deposition by interplanetary dust particles 

The  origins  of  IDPs  are  thought  to  be  comets  and  asteroids.  Because  IDPs  are 
abundant in noble gases, it has been proposed that IDPs are a non-negligible source of 
the  atmospheric  Ne  in  the  Martian  atmosphere  (Flynn  1997).  We  adopted  a  gas 
deposition model proposed by Flynn (1997) for the noble gases (Table 3 and Figure 2). 
The gas deposition rate is assumed to be constant through time in our model. Because 
Ne abundance in IDPs varies in samples (Pepin et al. 2000) and higher abundance than 
the  IDP  samples  was  reported  from  cometary  samples  obtained  by  Stardust  mission 
(Marty et al. 2008), we also tested cases where the rate of Ne deposition is an order of 
magnitude higher than the Flynn (1997) model. We refer to the Ne abundance in IDPs 
normalized by the Flynn (1997) model as 𝐶‘9,abc. We calculated the cases of 𝐶‘9,abc =
1 and  10.  We  will  show  that  the  higher  Ne  abundance  is  suitable  to  explain  the  Ne 
abundance  in  the  Martian  atmosphere  (Section  3).  We  note  that  in  this  study  it  is 
assumed that the gas deposition from IDPs occurs immediately after injection into the 
atmosphere. 

2.7. Isotopic fractionation 

Isotopic  compositions  are  changed  by  the  escape-induced  fractionation, 
continuous  supplies  from  volcanic  degassing  and  IDPs,  and  stochastic  impact 
replenishments. The change rate caused by the escape is written as,  

dIm,n

where  m  and  n  denote  two  isotopes, Im,n is  the  isotope  ratio, Rm/n is  the  fractionation 
factor, N is the number density of the element considered, and Nk is the number density 
of the isotope k. The change rate caused by the continuous supplies is given by,

impacts does not affect the isotope compositions. 

Because the sputtering is an energetic process, the fractionation is caused only 
by  diffusive  separation  between  the  homopause  and  exobase.  The  fractionation  factor 
𝑅eAff,8/g  is  given  by  Equation  7.  The  photochemical  escape  has  an  additional 
fractionation  effect  and  the  fractionation  factor  for  N    Rph,14N/15N    is  1.3-1.4 × 
Rdiff,14N/15N  (Wallis  1989;  Fox  and  Hác  1997;  Manning  et  al.  2008).  We  assumed 
Rph,14N/15N=1.4 × Rdiff,14N/15N. 

2.8. Isotopic compositions 

We  summarized  isotopic  compositions  used  in  our  model  in  Table  4.  The  N 
isotopic composition in the Martian interior was estimated from the Martian meteorites 
(δ15N = -30‰, Mathew and Marti 2001). The Ne isotopic composition of volcanic gas 
is assumed to be solar (Pepin 1991) from considering the presence of solar-type Ne in 
the  Earth’s  mantle  (Marty  2012).  Other  volcanic  noble  gases  are  assumed  to  be 
chondritic  (Pepin  1991).  Our  results  will  show  that  the  atmospheric  noble  gases  are 
likely  to  have  originated  from  comets  and  IDPs.  Therefore,  the  assumption  about 
isotopic compositions of volcanic noble gases does not affect our results. 

Isotopic  compositions  of  volatiles  in  asteroids  are  assumed  to  be  chondritic 
(Pepin 1991). The N isotopic composition, which gives a lower limit of the atmospheric 
pressure on early Mars in Section 3, varies from ~ -30‰ (enstatite chondrites) to ~40 ‰ 
(CI chondrites). We assumed δ15N = -30‰, which is identical to the δ15N value of the 
Martian building blocks preserved in the Martian mantle (Mathew and Marti, 2001), to 
obtain a lower limit of the atmospheric pressure on early Mars by using the N isotopes 
(Section 3).  

The N isotopic composition in comets is assumed to be δ15N = 1000‰, which is 
a  typical  value  obtained  from  telescopic  observations  (Füri  and  Marty  2015).  We 
adopted the 38Ar/36Ar ratio recently measured by Rosetta mission (Balsiger et al. 2015) 
and assumed solar composition for other noble gases (Pepin 1991, Dauphas 2003). 

Solar  composition  is  assumed  for  the  noble  gases  in  IDPs  (Pepin  1991).  As 
shown in Section 3, only the atmospheric Ne possibly originated from IDPs. Therefore, 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 

the  assumption  on  the  noble  gas  isotopes  except  for  Ne  in  IDPs  does  not  affect  our 
results. 

We note that  40Ar has a radiogenic origin (radioactive decay of  40K) and is not 
included  in  our  model.  A  crustal  erosion  model  was  proposed  to  account  for  the 
evolution  of  40Ar,  but  the  erosion  process  is  poorly  constrained  (Slipski  and  Jakosky 
2016).  Incorporating  the  crustal  erosion  will  impose  another  free  parameter  on  us  and 
therefore we decided not to include this isotope with a different origin.  

2.9. Initial conditions 

All of our calculations start at the end of the early hydrodynamic-escape stage at 
~4.5  Ga  when  the  primordial  hydrogen-dominated  atmosphere  has  been  lost  (Pepin 
1994).  Thus,  we  modeled  the  atmospheric  history  from  4.5  Ga  to  the  present  in  this 
study.  The  validity  of  this  assumption  will  be  discussed  in  subsection  4.3.  The  initial 
atmospheric  pressure  is  unknown,  but  it  should  be  less  than  3  bar,  as  a  denser  CO2 
atmosphere is unstable against the collapse (Forget et al. 2013). We assumed 1.5 bar as 
the  initial  pressure  in  most  of  our  calculations.  Because  the  stochastic  behavior  of 
impacts  provides  various  evolution  tracks  from  this  specific  initial  condition  (see 
Section 3), our conclusion does not depend on the initial pressure as long as it is several 
bars. 

The  isotopic  compositions  of  the  atmosphere  in  the  initial  state  correspond  to 
those after the hydrodynamic escape of the primordial hydrogen-rich atmosphere (Pepin 
1991; 1994). We assumed volcanic isotopic compositions for N and noble gases except 
for Xe. Because the fractionated Xe of the Martian atmosphere has been interpreted as 
being a remnant of the primordial atmosphere (Pepin 1991; Pepin 1994), its present-day 
isotopic composition was utilized to test the hypothesis. 

3. Results and data interpretations 

First,  we  will  calibrate  our  model  by  comparing  the  model  outputs  to  the 
elemental  and  isotopic  compositions  of  the  Martian  atmosphere  (subsection  3.1).  We 
will constrain input parameters (Xgas, Cvol, CNe, IDP, and fcomet) by examining the relation 
between  individual  inputs  and  outcomes  rather  than  exploring  the  entire  parameter 
space. It will be shown that the atmospheric pressure governs the fractionation regime 
of  isotopes  in  the  atmosphere  (subsection  3.2).  The  calibrated  model  will  be  used  to 
constrain  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  early  Mars  by  comparing  our  results  to  the 
isotopic  data  of  the  Martian  atmosphere  at  4.1  Ga  recorded  in  the  Martian  meteorite 
ALH 84001 (subsection 3.3). 

3.1. Model calibration: reproducing the present-day atmosphere 

We show the evolution of atmospheric pressure in our baseline model in Figure 
5. The baseline model assumed fcomet = 0, Cvol = 1 and CNe,IDP = 1. The results are shown 
for  Xgas  =  10%  (Figure  5a)  and  1%  (Figure  5b).  Since  intense  impact  bombardment 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 

during the first ~ 1 Gyrs largely affects the atmospheric mass, the atmospheric pressure 
evolved  stochastically.  Different  evolutionary  tracks  were  obtained  from  a  hundred 
Monte  Carlo  simulations.  The  results  showed  a  dominance  of  accumulation  when 
volatile-rich asteroids were assumed as impactors (Figure 5a). It is consistent with the 
results  of  de  Niem  et  al.  (2012).  In  contrast,  in  cases  where  relatively  volatile-poor 
impactors  were  assumed,  the  impact  erosion  prevailed  over  the  replenishment  of 
volatiles  and  led  to  atmospheric  collapse  occurring  at  ~4  Ga  (Figure  5b).  The  net 
decrease  of  the  atmospheric  pressure  over  time  is  consistent  with  the  geological 
evidence (Section 1). Hereafter we assumed Xgas = 1%. We note that this assumption—
that  the  late  accretion  was  dominated  by  volatile-poor  impactors—is  supported  by 
recent isotopic analyses of the late veneer in the terrestrial mantle (Fischer-Gödde and 
Kleine 2017). 

Whereas  the  primitive  isotopic  compositions  were  preserved  for  a  long  time 
under  a  dense  atmosphere,  a  thin  atmosphere  is  influenced  by  the  escape  and 
replenishment  processes  on  a  short  timescale  (subsection  3.2).  Thus,  the  different 
evolutionary  tracks  in  Figure  5  have  different  isotopic  signatures.  We  compare  the 
simulated  atmospheric  compositions  to  the  elemental  and  isotopic  data  of  the  present-
day  atmosphere  obtained  from  exploration  missions  and  from  Martian  meteorites  for 
model calibration in the following paragraphs.  

We compared the elemental and isotopic compositions obtained from our model 
to those of the present-day atmosphere on Mars (Figures 6-11).  Elemental abundances 
are compared in Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c. Because the atmospheric C (CO2) abundance in 
the collapsed cases is determined by the equilibrium with the surface reservoirs in our 
model, the abundance always equals the observed value. The atmospheric C on present-
day  Mars  was  mainly  sourced  from  the  volcanic  degassing.  The  baseline  model  (no 
comets) contained lower amounts of N and noble gases than the observed values (Figure 
6a).  In  addition,  lighter  elements  (Ne  and  Ar)  were  depleted  compared  with  the 
chondritic or volcanic elemental pattern as a result of the sputtering and photochemical 
escape.  Changing  the  volcanic  degassing  rate  Cvol  mainly  affected  the  N  abundance 
(Figure  6a).  Increasing  Cvol  to  5  resulted  in  an  adequate  amount  of  N,  whereas  noble 
gases  were  still  depleted  compared  with  the  present-day  Mars.  This  is  because  the 
volcanic gas is depleted in noble gases (Figure 2). Hereafter we assume Cvol = 5. 

Next,  we  changed  CNe,IDP  and  fcomet  to  reproduce  the  noble  gas  abundances 
assuming their exogenous origins. Because Ne was rapidly lost from a thin atmosphere 
due to the sputtering, Ne supplied by impacts has been lost in the present-day Mars. The 
lifetime of Ne in the Martian atmosphere was estimated to be ~0.1 Gyrs (Jakosky et al. 
1994).  The  present-day  abundance  is  controlled  by  continuous  supply  by  IDPs.  The 
model  assuming  Ne-rich  IDPs  is  more  suitable  for  reproducing  the  abundance  in  the 
Martian  atmosphere  (Figure  6b).  We  found  that  IDPs  are  only  related  to  the  Ne 
abundance (and vice versa) and do not affect the other elements in our model. We note 
that  the  origin  of  atmospheric  Ne—derived  from  IDPs  in  our  model—may  depend  on 
the assumption for the history and composition of volcanic degassing.  

Apart from Ne, the observed noble gas abundances can be explained by a small 
amount of cometary contribution (Figure 6b). The suitable ratio of cometary to asteroid 

12 

 
 
13 

impacts  (fcomet)  was  ~0.1%.  The  Ne  abundance  was  insensitive  to  fcomet  because  the 
episodically  supplied  Ne  by  cometary  impacts  was  rapidly  removed  from  the  Martian 
atmosphere. Hereafter, we refer to the model assuming Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet 
= 0.1%, as the best-fit model (Figure 6c). 

The best-fit model reproduced all of the observed isotopic compositions of the 
present-day atmosphere on Mars except for Xe isotopes. The evolution of the N isotopic 
composition is shown in Figure 7. The results of Monte Carlo simulations showed two 
different behaviors depending on whether the atmosphere collapsed or not (Figure 7a). 
Whereas  the  N  isotope  ratio  preserved  the  primitive  value  under  a  dense  atmosphere, 
the  value  started  to  increase  as  the  atmosphere  became  thinner.  The  15N/14N  isotope 
ratio  evolved  stochastically  in  a  collapsed  thin  atmosphere  due  to  episodic  impact 
events  and  the  following  escape-induced  fractionation  (Figure  7b).  We  note  that  the 
fractionation  before  4.1  Ga  was  caused  by  the  photochemical  escape  only  (without 
sputtering)  because  the  magnetic  protection  was  assumed.  After  the  quasi-steady  state 
between  ~3.5  Ga  to  ~0.5  Ga,  the  N  isotope  ratio  started  to  increase  as  the  volcanic 
degassing  diminished.  The  N  isotope  ratio  in  the  collapsed  cases  successfully 
reproduced the present-day value obtained by Curiosity (Wong et al. 2013).  

The isotopic compositions of Ne (20Ne/22Ne), Ar (38Ar/36Ar), and Kr (86Kr/84Kr 
as a representative ratio) in the Martian atmosphere were also reproduced in our model, 
while Xe (136Xe/130Xe as a representative ratio) was not (Figures 8-11). As well as N, 
the evolutionary tracks of Ne and Ar are classified into two branches depending on the 
presence/absence  of  the  atmospheric  collapse  (Figures  8a  and  9a).  In  contrast  to  the 
isotope ratios moderately evolving in a dense atmosphere, stochastic fractionation was 
observed after the atmospheric collapse and the cessation of the dynamo assumed at 4.1 
Ga (when the sputtering started to operate) because of episodic impact events and the 
following  escape-induced  fractionation.  The  averaged  value  of  the  present-day 
38Ar/36Ar ratios in our simulations matched the data measured by Curiosity (Atreya et al. 
2013).  Our  model  also  reproduced  the  20Ne/22Ne  ratio  of  the  present-day  atmosphere 
estimated from Martian meteorites (Pepin 1991).  

Isotopic  compositions  of  Kr  and  Xe  in  our  model  were  determined  by  the 
mixing of the supplied values because of the inefficient sputtering due to their masses 
being  heavier  than  N,  Ne  and  Ar.  Impacts  eroded  the  original  (chondritic)  Kr  and  Xe 
isotopes and supplied the cometary (solar-like) isotopes in our best-fit model. We note 
that  the  isotopic  composition  at  the  end  can  be  chondritic  in  the  cases  where  fcomet  is 
lower. The best-fit model is consistent with the solar-like isotopic pattern of Kr in the 
Martian  atmosphere  estimated  from  Martian  meteorites  (Pepin  1991)  and  recently 
measured  by  Curiosity  (Conrad  et  al.  2016).  We  started  our  simulations  by  assuming 
that the isotopic compositions of Xe were identical to those in the present-day Martian 
atmosphere  because  the  Xe  isotopes  have  been  considered  as  a  remnant  of  early 
hydrodynamic loss (Pepin 1994). However, the initial isotopic composition of Xe was 
lost  in  the  first  100-101  Myrs  in  our  model  by  the  impact  erosion  and  replenishment. 
Fractionation caused by Xe ionization on a timescale of billions years, which is poorly 
understood and is not included in our model, might be responsible for the fractionated 
Xe in the Martian atmosphere, as was proposed to explain fractionated Xe in the Earth’s 

13 

 
 
14 

atmosphere  (Pujol  et  al.  2011).  We  note  that  impactors  having  originally-fractionated 
Xe isotopes (Zahnle et al. 1990) cannot be ruled out. 

The  stochastic  evolution  of  the  isotopic  compositions  after  the  atmospheric 
collapse (Figures 7-11) was caused by stochastic impacts. The fluxes of the escape and 
replenishment  processes  are  compared  in  Figure  12.  The  atmospheric  erosion  and 
replenishment  by  impacts  were  dominant  processes  prior  to  ~4  Ga.  The  supply  of 
volatiles  by  the  impacts  led  to  the  rise  in  both  their  abundances  and  escape  rates  in  a 
collapsed  atmosphere  (Figures  12a  and  12b),  causing  the  following  escape-induced 
fractionation (Figures 7b and 9b).  

From  the  end  of  the  LHB  period  (~3.5  Ga),  the  volcanic  degassing  dominated 
the  replenishment  of  N  and  balanced  the  loss  caused  by  the  sputtering  and 
photochemical escape (Figure 12a). This balance corresponds to the quasi-steady state 
observed in the N isotope ratio (Figure 7b). We note that the isotope ratio in the steady 
state can be written as (Yung et al. 1988; Jakosky et al. 1994; Kurokawa et al. 2016), 

Im, n=

0

Im, n
Rm/n

 .        (12) 

The increase of the 15N/14N ratio after ~0.5 Ga (Figure 7b) was caused by the decay of 
volcanic degassing and the dominance of the photochemical escape over the sputtering 
(Figure  12a).  The  photochemical  escape  induced  more  efficient  fractionation  than  the 
sputtering (Section 2). 

Stochastic impacts greatly affected the evolution of the Ar isotopes relative to N 
(Figures  12a  and  12b);  the  major  source  of  Ar  is  comets,  in  contrast  to  the  N  source 
being  continuous  volcanic  degassing.  This  caused  the  38Ar/36Ar  ratio  to  be  more 
scattered and a steady state to be unclear (Figure 9b). 

In  summary,  the  Martian  atmosphere  in  our  model  evolved  as  follows.  Impact 
erosion  and  replenishment  governed  the  evolution  before  ~4  Ga,  whereas  the  other 
processes  (photochemical  escape,  sputtering,  volcanic  degassing  and  supply  by  IDPs) 
became effective after the LHB period. Changing Xgas affected the balance between the 
impact  erosion  and  replenishment  during  the  early  period.  Major  components  of  the 
atmosphere  (C  and  N)  on  present-day  Mars  were  mainly  sourced  from  the  volcanic 
degassing  (controlled  by  Cvol).  On  the  other  hand,  noble  gases  were  supplied  from 
comets  and  IDPs  (controlled  by  fcomet  and  CNe,IDP).  Finally,  the  major  finding  of  our 
model  is  the  difference  in  the  isotopic  fractionation  before  and  after  the  atmospheric 
collapse; a dense atmosphere preserved the primitive isotopic compositions, whereas a 
thin  atmosphere  experienced  stochastic  fractionation  because  of  episodic  supply  of 
volatiles by impacts and the following escape-induced fractionation. 

3.2.  The  effect  of  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  the  timescales  of  the  isotopic 
fractionation 

The  atmospheric  pressure  (namely,  the  total  mass  of  the  atmosphere)  has  a 
dominant  effect  on  the  degree  of  isotope  fractionation  at  a  given  time.  We  show  the 
influence of the atmospheric pressure on the timescales of the isotopic fractionation in 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
15 

this  subsection.  These  are  useful  to  understand  our  results  and  consequently  to  obtain 
constraints  on  the  early  atmosphere  (subsection  3.3).  We  use  N  and  Ar  as  examples 
because  the  Curiosity  measurements  are  available  and  these  isotopes  will  be  used  to 
constrain the atmospheric pressure on early Mars (subsection 3.3). 

To  demonstrate  the  effect  of  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  the  fractionation 
timescales, we calculated the cases where the CO2 partial pressure is forced to decrease 
gradually in the best-fit model (Figure 13). We do not specify the cause of the decrease 
in  CO2  pressure;  both  carbonate  formation  and  CO2  sublimation  can  contribute  to  the 
decrease. In these cases, we did not assume atmospheric collapse. The N (15N/14N) and 
Ar  (38Ar/36Ar)  isotope  ratios  increased  faster  as  the  atmosphere  became  thinner. 
Consequently,  the  stochastic  behavior  caused  by  impacts  appeared.  Primitive  values 
were  preserved  over  a  longer  timescale  under  a  denser  atmosphere.  The  onset  of 
fractionation following the decrease in atmospheric pressure (Figure 13) and the rapid 
fractionation after the atmospheric collapse (Figures 7-11) can be explained by shorter 
timescales  of  the  isotopic  fractionation  under  a  lower  atmospheric  pressure.  The 
timescales of the fractionation induced by the photochemical escape and sputtering (the 
total  number  of  the  species  in  the  atmosphere  divided  by  the  flux)  are  shown  as 
functions of the atmospheric pressure and time in Figure 14. The timescales are shorter 
for a lower pressure and for an earlier time because of the smaller atmospheric volume 
and  the  higher  EUV  flux  with  more  intense  solar  wind,  respectively.  Contrary  to  the 
timescales being ~10-1-100 Gyrs for a dense atmosphere (~ several bar) at ~4 Ga, those 
for  a  collapsed  thin  atmosphere  (6  mbar  in  our  model)  are  distinctly  short  (~10-3-10-1 
Gyrs).  The  decrease  of  the  timescales  caused  the  faster  evolution  in  a  thinner 
atmosphere  (Figure  13)  and  distinct  behaviors  of  the  collapsed  and  uncollapsed 
atmospheres (Figures 7-11).  

3.3. Constraining the atmospheric pressure on early Mars 

We  will  constrain  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  early  Mars  using  the  model 
calibrated  by  the  elemental  and  isotopic  compositions  of  the  present-day  atmosphere 
(the best-fit model, subsection 3.1). The best-fit model is further constrained by N and 
Ar  isotopic  compositions  of  an  early  atmosphere.  We  employed  δ15N  and  38Ar/36Ar 
values of 7 ‰ and ≤0.2, respectively, for the 4 Ga atmospheric component (Mathew and 
Marti  2001).  These  values  were  obtained  by  stepwise-heating  experiments  of  ALH 
84001.  ALH  84001  is  a  Martian  orthopyroxinite  that  was  initially  formed  by  4.1  Ga 
igneous  activity  (Bouvier  et  al.  2009;  Lapen  et  al.  2010).  ALH  84001  subsequently 
experienced  a  ~4  Ga  secondary  alteration  process  that  formed  carbonate  (Borg  et  al. 
1999);  these  carbonates  are  believed  to  have  formed  from  water  that  was  closely 
associated with the Noachian atmosphere (e.g., Niles et al., 2013, Halevy et al. 2011). 
Based  on  detailed  investigations  of  trapped  gas  components  in  the  individual  steps, 
Mathew and Marti (2001) concluded that the δ15N and 38Ar/36Ar values of 7 ‰ and ≤0.2 
should represent an ancient (~4 Ga) atmospheric component.  

The comparison of our model to the ALH 84001 data suggests an uncollapsed, 
moderately dense atmosphere (> 0.5 bar) at 4.1 Ga regardless of the presence/absence 
of the magnetic field at that time. The N and Ar isotope ratios at 4.1 Ga were compared 
to  the  simulated  isotope  ratios  in  various  evolutionary  tracks  obtained  by  the  best-fit 

15 

 
 
 
16 

model in Figures 7b, 9b, and 13. The 38Ar/36Ar isotope ratio started to increase because 
of  the  sputtering  after  both  the  atmospheric  collapse  and  cessation  of  the  magnetic 
dynamo  (Figure  9b).  This  suggests  that  the  atmosphere  was  not  collapsed  (>  0.5  bar, 
Forget et al. 2013) and moderately dense (> ~100 bar, considering the timescale shown 
in Figure 14c); otherwise the sputtering was prohibited prior to 4.1 Ga. On the contrary, 
the δ15N value started to increase, even before the cessation of the dynamo at 4.1 Ga, as 
the atmospheric pressure decreased (Figure 7b). The photochemical escape removed N 
and fractionated the N isotope ratio regardless of the presence/absence of the magnetic 
dynamo. The unfractionated N isotope ratio recorded in ALH 84001 was reproduced in 
the cases where the atmosphere was not collapsed (> 0.5 bar, Figure 7b) and moderately 
dense  (>  ~10-1-100  bar,  see  Figure  13  and  Figure  14c).  We  note  that  the  actual 
atmospheric pressure at 4.1 Ga should have been greater than this lower limit (0.5 bar) 
when several factors to increase the isotope ratios—for instance, the sputtering prior to 
4.1 Ga—are considered (see subsection 4.3 and Figure 15). 

Our results on the N and Ar isotope compositions suggested the lowest bounds 
(~0.5  bar)  for  the  atmospheric  pressure  at  4.1  Ga.  We  emphasize  that  this  lower  limit 
was  derived  both  from  two  independent  constraints.  One  was  that  the  timescales  of 
escape-induced  fractionation  should  be  long  enough  to  preserve  the  primitive  isotopic 
compositions (Figures 13 and 14). The other was that the atmospheric pressure should 
be higher than the threshold of the atmospheric collapse (Figures 7 and 9). Therefore, 
the lower limit is valid even if the threshold of the atmospheric collapse is much lower 
or absent because of high obliquity, for instance (Forget et al. 2013; Soto et al. 2015). 

4. Discussion 

4.1. The evolution of the atmospheric pressure through time 

A  moderately  dense  atmosphere  at  ~4  Ga  has  also  been  suggested  by  other 
geochemical, geological, and theoretical constraints (Manga et al. 2012; Van Berk et al. 
2012;  Cessata  et  al.  2012;  Kite  et  al.  2014;  Forget  et  al.  2013;  Hu  et  al.  2015). 
Constraints  on  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  early  Mars  are  summarized  in  Figure  16. 
The lower limit obtained from this study (0.5 bar at 4.1 Ga) is consistent with most of 
these previous works. 

Whereas our model predicted that the Martian atmosphere was denser than ~0.5 
bar at 4.1 Ga, the atmospheric and surface reservoirs on present-day Mars contain CO2 
that corresponds to less than 100 mbar (Kurahashi-Nakamura and Tajika 2006; Lammer 
et  al.  2008)  (Figure  16).  It  suggests  a  subsequent  decrease  in  the  surficial  CO2  mass 
after  4.1  Ga.  As  the  surficial  CO2  becomes  less  than  ~0.5  bar,  the  atmosphere  would 
have  collapsed  at  once.  Subsequent  reinflation  events  might  have  occurred  driven  by 
obliquity changes (Forget et al. 2013; Kite et al. 2014). The inflated intervals, combined 
with other short-lived greenhouse effects (Segura et al. 2002; 2008), might be related to 
surface liquid water production in the Hesperian (Kite et al. 2014). 

Comparisons to studies about the evolution of water on Mars (e.g., Kurokawa et 
al.  2014,  2016;  Mahaffy  et  al.  2015;  Villanueva  et  al.  2015)  provide  comprehensive

views  on  the  evolution  of  the  surface  environment  on  Mars.  The  evolution  of  the 
hydrogen isotope (D/H) ratio has suggested significant loss prior to 4.1 Ga (Kurokawa 
et  al.  2014),  probably  because  of  thermal  escape  induced  by  strong  EUV  irradiation 
from the young sun. The EUV irradiation would also cause the photochemical escape of 
N  as  was  assumed  in  this  study.  The  decrease  in  the  atmospheric  pressure  and  the 
following  atmospheric  collapse  would  cause  a  climate  change  on  Mars.  The  climate 
change  might  lead  to  a  limited  water  exchange  between  the  surface  and  subsurface 
reservoirs,  resulting  in  heterogeneous  D/H  distribution  on  Mars  (Mahaffy  et  al.  2015; 
Usui et al. 2015; Kurokawa et al. 2016).  

4.2. Comparisons with previous studies on the atmospheric pressure on early Mars  

The  lower  limit  of  ~0.5  bar  on  the  atmospheric  pressure  at  the  time  of  ALH 
84001  crystallization  might  be  inconsistent  with  the  upper  limit  of  0.4  bar  that  was 
argued to have existed at the same time by Cessata et al. (2012) (Figure 16). They used 
the  high  40Ar/36Ar  ratio  (626  ±  100)  of  the  trapped  gas  in  ALH  84001  (Cessata  et  al. 
2010) to evaluate the early atmospheric pressure and obtained this upper limit. Contrary 
to  Cessata  et  al.  (2012),  in  which  a  simplified  evolution  model  was  used,  Slipski  and 
Jakosky (2016) recently studied the evolution of Ar isotopic compositions (36Ar,  38Ar, 
and 40Ar) with a more complicated model by modeling various processes and reservoirs. 
The high 40Ar/36Ar ratio at 4.1 Ga obtained by Cessata et al. (2010) was not reproduced 
in  Slipski  and  Jakosky  (2016).  Slipski  and  Jakosky  (2016)  discussed  several 
possibilities to reproduce the high 40Ar/36Ar ratio, including early catastrophic degassing 
and sputtering prior to 4.1 Ga, but neither Cessata et al. (2012) nor Slipski and Jakosky 
(2016)  investigated  these.  These  possibilities  may  be  capable  of  reproducing  the  high 
40Ar/36Ar ratio in a moderately dense atmosphere. In addition, we note that Mathew and 
Marti (2001) reported a much lower  40Ar/36Ar ratio (~130 ± 6) in the temperature step 
corresponding to the highest 38Ar/36Ar ratio. To identify the actual 40Ar/36Ar ratio at the 
time of ALH 84001 crystallization is crucial for constraining the early evolution of the 
Martian atmosphere. 

Our  model  showed  that  a  dense  CO2  atmosphere  prevents  minor  atmospheric 
species from escaping, which is consistent with the behavior of the model of Slipski and 
Jakosky  (2016).  However,  we  found  stochastic  evolution  of  the  38Ar/36Ar  ratio  in 
contrast to the rather monotonic evolution in Slipski and Jakosky (2016). This is mainly 
caused  by  a  difference  in  Ar  sources:  stochastic  cometary  impacts  in  our  model  and 
volcanic degassing in Slipski and Jakosky (2016). Cometary supply was not included in 
Slipski and Jakosky (2016). Because the volcanic gas is depleted in noble gases—even 
with  Cvol  =  5,  which  can  supply  enough  N  to  the  atmosphere  in  our  model—we 
conclude  that  noble  gases  are  likely  to  have  exogenous  origins  (subsection  3.1).  The 
exogenous origin of noble gases has also been proposed by other studies (e.g., Marty et 
al.  2016).  We  note  that  the  monotonic  evolution  of  the  38Ar/36Ar  ratio  can  also  be 
obtained in our model (Figure 13). 

We assumed that the hydrodynamic escape did not occur after the transition to 
the  CO2-rich  atmosphere.  In  contrast,  Tian  et  al.  (2009)  proposed  a  hydrodynamic 
escape  of  the  CO2-rich  atmosphere  and  concluded  that  a  CO2-dominated  atmosphere 
could  not  have  been  maintained  before  4.1  Ga.  The  contrast  is  due  to  the  different 

17

exobase temperature; we adopted the exobase temperature of 1200 K at 4.5 Ga, which 
was  calculated  by  assuming  a  CO2-rich  atmosphere  and  a  solar  XUV  flux  100  times 
higher than the present-day value (Kulikov et al. 2007; Terada et al. 2009), while Tian 
et al. (2009) obtained >2500 K for a solar EUV flux 20 times larger than the present-
day  value.  Adopting  our  model  in  the  scenario  of  Tian  et  al.  (2009)  would  lead  to 
significant  enrichment  of  heavy  isotopes  similar  to  the  collapsed  cases  in  this  study 
(Section  3).  Future  measurements  of  Martian  meteorites  will  provide  atmospheric 
isotope  data  for  different  eras  (see  subsection  4.4)  and  enable  us  to  test  the  various 
scenarios. 

4.3. Validity of model assumptions 

There  are  several  CO2  sinks,  which  are  not  included  in  our  model,  and 
parameters  that  are  not  investigated  in  detail.  Carbonate  formation  (Hu  et  al.  2015; 
Wray  et  al.  2015)  and  basal  melting  of  the  CO2  ice  cap  (Kurahashi-Nakamura  and 
Tajika 2006; Longhi 2006) may have affected the evolution of the atmospheric pressure. 
The size and velocity distributions of impactors, the assumed temperature, and the total 
mass  of  impactors  also  affect  the  evolution.  Changing  these  values  would  change  the 
best-fit  parameters  moderately.  However,  our  conclusion  is  not  influenced  by  these 
changes,  as  the  atmospheric  pressure  determines  the  time  scale  of  the  isotopic 
fractionation (subsection 3.2). Therefore, the lower limit of early atmosphere obtained 
in this study ( ~0.5 bar) is robust as long as the unfractionated N and Ar in ALH 84001 
(Mathew and Marti 2001) actually represent the early atmosphere. 

The  actual  atmospheric  pressure  at  4.1  Ga  should  have  been  greater  than  our 
lower  limit  (~0.5  bar)  when  we  consider  several  factors  to  increase  the  isotope  ratios. 
We show the evolution of N and Ar isotope ratios in the cases where the magnetic field 
was absent from the beginning (i.e., the sputtering operated before 4.1 Ga) in Figure 15. 
The  sputtering  fractionated  these  isotope  ratios  before  the  collapse  even  occurred.  It 
suggests that a much denser atmosphere is required to explain the unfractionated isotope 
data  at  4.1  Ga  if  the  ancient  magnetic  field  was  weak  or  absent.  We  assumed  that 
asteroids have a relatively low δN value (-30‰, Table 4), but asteroids with higher δN 
values might have contributed to the late accretion. In addition, cometary impacts prior 
to  4.1  Ga  are  not  included  in  our  model.  If  these  impactors  with  heavier  N  isotopic 
composition contributed to the late accretion, they would  add to the increase in the N 
isotope ratio in the Martian atmosphere. 

We calculated the evolution of the Martian atmosphere from 4.5 Ga by assuming 
that the hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere has been lost by hydrodynamic escape at 
4.5 Ga (Section 2). We test the validity of this assumption. The age of the solar system 
estimated  from  calcium-aluminum-rich  inclusions  is  4.567  Ga  (Amelin  et  al.  2010; 
nK.o Myrs 
Connelly et al. 2012). The accretion timescale of Mars was estimated to be 1.8mZ.K
(Dauphas  and  Pourmand  2011).  The  mass  of  the  primordial  atmosphere  on  Mars  is  < 
1018 kg (Ikoma and Genda 2006). Mars started to lose its primordial atmosphere after 
the dissipation of the solar nebula. The timescale of the dissipation of the solar nebula is 
a few Myrs (Haisch et al. 2001). The timescale to remove the hydrogen-rich atmosphere 
can  be  estimated  by  combining  the  analytical  estimate  of  the  escape  rate  and  the 
estimated EUV flux at the time (e.g., Kurokawa and Kaltenegger 2013; Kurokawa and 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
19 

Nakamoto  2014).  The  energy-limited  formula  of  the  hydrodynamic  escape  (e.g., 
Watson et al. 1981) is given by, 

𝑑𝑀atm
𝑑𝑡

}

vwxyz{|
~(cid:127)|

,        (12) 

where 𝑀2:8 is  the  atmospheric  mass, 𝜖 is  the  efficiency  (~0.1), 𝐹WXY is  the  solar  EUV 
flux, 𝑅> and 𝑀> are  the  radius  and  mass  of  Mars,  and 𝐺 is  the  gravitational  constant. 
Using the solar EUV flux in the saturation phase estimated from solar proxies (Ribas et 
al. 2005, Section 2), the escape timescale is estimated to be ~ 100 Myrs. Therefore, it is 
valid to assume that the hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere has been lost at 4.50 Ga 
or even earlier. We note that starting from an earlier time (e.g., from 4.56 Ga) requires 
higher atmospheric pressure at 4.1 Ga because the earlier EUV irradiation could affect 
N isotopes. Therefore, our constraint shown in Section 3 (> 0.5 bar) should be treated as 
a lower limit. 

4.4. Synergy to the MAVEN mission and future analyses of Martian meteorites 

Our  model  is  capable  of  connecting  the  atmospheric  escape  modeling  with 
geochemical  records  (isotopic  data).  The  atmospheric  escape  rates  from  early  Mars 
remain uncertain; the estimates on the sputtering rate vary in the previous studies (e.g., 
Luhmann  et  al.  1992;  Chassefière  et  al.  2007;  Chassefière  and  Leblanc  2011).  The 
ongoing  MAVEN  mission  (Jakosky  et  al.  2015)  will  provide  better  understanding  of 
escape mechanisms and estimates on the escape rates from early Mars by observing the 
response of the Martian atmosphere to solar activity. Incorporating the escape rates into 
our model will provide further constraints on the evolution of the Martian atmosphere. 

The  isotopic  compositions  of  N  and  noble  gases  recorded  in  ALH  84001  are 
crucial to constrain the atmospheric pressure on early Mars. Whereas we used the less-
fractionated 15N/14N ratio reported by Mathew and Marti (2001), the data on N isotopic 
composition  in  ALH  84001  vary  in  the  literature  (up  to  >  150‰,  Grady  et  al.  1998; 
Miura  and  Sugiura  2000).  Mathew  and  Marti  (2001)  interpreted  these  heavy  N 
components as cosmogenic. Identification of the more reliable N isotopic ratio at 4.1 Ga 
would help constrain the early evolution of the Martian atmosphere. 

Since  the  reliability  of  our  model  depends  largely  on  the  4  Ga  atmospheric 
component,  the  model  will  be  further  tested  by  new  measurements  of  Martian 
meteorites  that  will  provide  atmospheric  isotope  data  for  different  eras.  Because  the 
crystallization age of ALH 84001 corresponds to the time of the LHB, we cannot rule 
out the possibility that the N and Ar signatures are sourced by a major impact, although 
any impacts observed in our model did not completely reset the isotopic compositions 
in the atmosphere. For example, newly found Northwest Africa (NWA) 7533 and NWA 
7034  contain  volatile-rich  Martian  regolith  clasts  with  ages  of  4.4  Ga  and  2.1  Ga 
(Hymayun  et  al.  2013;  Agee  et  al.  2013).  Moreover,  recent  in-situ  isotope 
measurements by ion microprobe indicate that alteration veins in 1.3 Ga nakhlites have 
hydrogen  isotopic  compositions  similar  to  that  of  Hesperian-aged  mudstone  measured 
by Curiosity (Mahaffy et al. 2015), but distinct from that of the present-day atmosphere 
(Hallis et al. 2012). If possible, extraction of such ancient atmospheric components from 

19 

 
 
 
20 

meteorites  by  novel  analytical  approaches  will  offer  a  significant  contribution  toward 
the accurate understanding of the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.  

5. Conclusions  

The  history  of  the  loss  and  replenishment  of  the  Martian  atmosphere  was 
simulated  to  constrain  the  atmospheric  pressure  on  early  Mars.  The  evolution  of  the 
isotopic compositions of N and noble gases was calculated by taking various processes 
into  consideration:  the  atmospheric  collapse,  impacts  of  asteroids/comets,  atmospheric 
escape induced by solar radiation/wind, volcanic degassing, and gas deposition by IDPs. 
Our model was capable of reproducing the elemental and isotopic compositions in the 
present-day  atmosphere,  except  for  Xe  isotopic  composition,  for  which  an  additional 
process  that  could  be  related  to  ionization,  was  suggested.  In  our  best-fit  model, 
atmospheric  N  originated  mainly  from  volcanic  degassing,  whereas  noble  gases  had 
exogenous origins: comets and IDPs. The calibrated model was adapted to early Mars to 
constrain the atmospheric pressure. We found that photochemical escape and sputtering 
efficiently  fractionate  the  isotopes  in  a  thin  atmosphere  during  the  early  stage.  We 
conclude  that  Mars  had  a  moderately  dense  atmosphere  (the  atmospheric  pressure  is 
higher  than  approximately  0.5  bar)  at  4  Ga,  if  the  unfractionated  N  and  Ar  isotopes 
recorded in ALH 84001 represent the atmospheric components at the time. This lower 
limit  is  valid  regardless  of  the  presence/absence  of  the  intrinsic  magnetic  field  at  the 
time because photochemical escape removed atmospheric N. Further constraints will be 
obtained  by  combining  our  model  with  upcoming  MAVEN  results  and  analyses  of 
isotopic compositions in Martian meteorites formed in different ages.

Figure 1:  

A schematic view of the model used in this study. 

Figure 2:  

Elemental  abundances  in  asteroids,  comets,  IDPs,  volcanic  gas,  and  the  Martian 
atmosphere,  with  respect  to  the  solar  values.  The  abundance  in  the  atmosphere  is 
normalized by the mass of solid Mars. Those of asteroids, comets, and IDPs (CNe,IDP = 
1) are normalized by the masses of these bodies. The abundance in volcanic gas shows 
the sum of degassed mass during 4.5 billion years in our model (Cvol = 1) normalized by 
the  mass  of  solid  Mars.  Data  are  from:  solar  abundance  (Pepin  1991),  asteroids  (CI 
chondrites, Pepin 1991), comets (Dauphas 2003), IDPs (Flynn 1997), and the Martian 
atmosphere (Pepin 1991; Mahaffy et al. 2013). 

Figure 3:  

(a) Size and (b) velocity distributions of impactors (selected 20 examples of the Monte 
Carlo results). 

Figure 4:  

Volcanic degassing rates of CO2 (purple), N2 (green), H2O (sky blue) as a function of 
time. The model is based on Craddock and Greeley (2009) (Cvol = 1). 

Figure 5:  

The evolution of the atmospheric pressure. (a) Volatile-rich impactor (Xgas = 10%) cases 
and (b) volatile-poor impactor (Xgas = 1%) cases. We assumed Cvol = 1, CNe,IDP = 1, and 
fcomet = 0.1% in both cases (a) and (b). A hundred Monte Carlo simulations are shown. 
Collapsed and uncollapsed cases are shown by thick colored lines and thin black lines, 
respectively.  (c)  Selected  three  typical  evolutionary  tracks:  the  case  where  the 
atmosphere  collapsed  after  4.1  Ga  (purple),  the  case  where  the  atmosphere  collapsed 
prior to 4.1 Ga (green), and the uncollapsed case (black). We assumed Xgas = 1%, Cvol = 
5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1% for case (c). 

Figure 6:  

Simulated  elemental  abundances  in  our  model  with  respect  to  solar  values.  Average 
values of the collapsed cases are shown. (a) Purple: Cvol = 1, CNe,IDP = 1, and fcomet = 0%, 
green: Cvol = 3, CNe,IDP = 1, and fcomet = 0%, sky blue: Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 1, and fcomet = 
0%, respectively. The inner subset shows an enlarged view of the nitrogen abundance. 
(b) Purple: Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 1, and fcomet = 0%, green: Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 
0%, sky blue: Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%, yellow: Cvol = 5, CNe, IDP = 10, 
and fcomet = 1%, respectively. (c) Our best-fit model: Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet =

0.1%, with 1-σ error bars. We assumed Xgas = 1% in all cases. The abundances in the 
Martian atmosphere are the same as Figure 2 (red). 

Figure 7:  
The evolution of the nitrogen isotope ratio (the δ15N value) in the best-fit model (Xgas = 
1%, Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%). (a) A hundred Monte Carlo simulations. 
(b)  Selected  three  cases  corresponding  to  Figure  5c.  Collapsed  and  uncollapsed  cases 
are shown by thick colored lines and thin black lines, respectively. The averaged value 
of the collapsed cases at 0 Ga is shown with 1-σ error bar (purple). Ranges of observed 
present-day  atmospheric  ratios  are  from  Curiosity  (red  solid-line,  Wong  et  al.  2013), 
Viking (red dashed-line, Nier and McElroy 1977), and ALH 84001 (red data point at 4.1 
Ga, Mathew and Marti 2001), respectively. 

Figure 8:  
The evolution of the Ne isotope ratio (20Ne/22Ne value) in the best-fit model (Xgas = 1%, 
Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%). (a) A hundred Monte Carlo simulations. (b) 
Selected  three  cases  corresponding  to  Figure  5c.  Collapsed  and  uncollapsed  cases  are 
shown by thick colored lines and thin black lines, respectively. The averaged value of 
the collapsed cases at 0 Ga is shown with 1-σ error bar (purple). A range of observed 
present-day atmospheric ratio (red) is from Martian meteorites (Pepin 1991). 

Figure 9:  
The evolution of the Ar isotope ratio (38Ar/36Ar value) in the best-fit model (Xgas = 1%, 
Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%). (a) A hundred Monte Carlo simulations. (b) 
Selected  three  cases  corresponding  to  Figure  5c.  Collapsed  and  uncollapsed  cases  are 
shown by thick colored lines and thin black lines, respectively. The averaged value of 
the  collapsed  cases  at  0  Ga  is  shown  with  1-σ  error  bar  (purple).  Ranges  of  observed 
present-day  atmospheric  ratios  are  from  Curiosity  (red  solid-line,  Atreya  et  al.  2013), 
Viking (red dashed-line, Owen et al. 1977), and ALH 84001 (red data point at 4.1 Ga, 
Mathew and Marti 2001), respectively. 

Figure 10:  
The  evolution  of  the  Kr  isotope  ratio  (86Kr/84Kr  value  as  an  example)  in  the  best-fit 
model (Xgas = 1%, Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%). (a) A hundred Monte Carlo 
simulations.  (b)  Selected  three  cases  corresponding  to  Figure  5c.  Collapsed  and 
uncollapsed  cases  are  shown  by  thick  colored  lines  and  thin  black  lines,  respectively. 
The averaged value of the collapsed cases at 0 Ga is shown with 1-σ error bar (purple). 
A  range  of  observed  present-day  atmospheric  ratio  (red)  is  from  Martian  meteorites 
(Pepin 1991). 

Figure 11:  
The evolution of the Xe isotope ratio (136Xe/130Xe value as an example) in the best-fit 
model (Xgas = 1%, Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%). (a) A hundred Monte Carlo 
simulations.  (b)  Selected  three  cases  corresponding  to  Figure  5c.  Collapsed  and 
uncollapsed  cases  are  shown  by  thick  colored  lines  and  thin  black  lines,  respectively.

The averaged value of the collapsed cases at 0 Ga is shown with 1-σ error bar (purple). 
A range of observed atmospheric ratio (red) is from Martian meteorites (Pepin 1991). 

Figure 12:  
The escape or replenishment rate of each process for (a) N and (b) Ar. The case where 
the atmosphere collapsed after 4.1 Ga (presented by a purple line in Figure 5c) is shown. 
The  values  are  positive  and  negative  for  processes  indicated  by  plus  and  minus, 
respectively. As the erosion and replenishment by impacts are treated as instantaneous 
processes  in  our  model,  these  rates  shown  in  the  figures  are  the  number  of 
supplied/removed particles divided by the time duration from one impact to the next. 

Figure 13:  
The cases where the CO2 partial pressure was assumed to decrease exponentially with 
the  timescale  τCO2.  (a)  The  assumed  evolution  of  CO2  partial  pressure  and  the 
evolution  of  (b,  c)  N  and  (d,  e)  Ar  isotope  ratio  (the  δ15N  and  38Ar/36Ar  values).  A 
hundred  Monte  Carlo  simulations  are  averaged.  We  also  plotted  the  1-σ  dispersion  in 
(c,e)  with  dashed  lines.  Colors  and  thicknesses  in  (b-e)  correspond  to  those  of  the 
pressure evolution in (a). 

Figure 14:  
The contours of the timescales of (a) the photochemical escape of N, (b) the sputtering 
of N, and (c) the sputtering of Ar, respectively, as functions of the time and atmospheric 
pressure. The timescale is defined as the total number of particles divided by the flux. 
We  assumed  that  only  two  components  are  present:  CO2  and  the  species  considered. 
The mixing ratio of the species to CO2 is assumed to be, NN2/NCO2 = 10-2 and NAr/NCO2 = 
10-6, respectively. We note that the dependence on the mixing ratio is weak. 

Figure 15:  
The evolution of the (a) N and (b) Ar isotope ratio (the δ15N and 38Ar/36Ar values) in the 
best-fit model (Xgas = 1%, Cvol = 5, CNe,IDP = 10, and fcomet = 0.1%) in the case where 
sputtering was assumed to start from 4.5 Ga.
