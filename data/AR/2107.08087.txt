DarkSide-50 has demonstrated the high potential of dual-phase liquid argon time projection cham-
bers in exploring interactions of WIMPs in the GeV/c2 mass range. The technique, based on the
detection of the ionization signal ampliﬁed via electroluminescence in the gas phase, allows to ex-
plore recoil energies down to the sub-keV range. We report here on the DarkSide-50 measurement
of the ionization yield of electronic recoils down to ∼180 eVer, exploiting 37Ar and 39Ar decays, and
extrapolated to a few ionization electrons with the Thomas-Imel box model. Moreover, we present a
model-dependent determination of the ionization response to nuclear recoils down to ∼500 eVnr, the
lowest ever achieved in liquid argon, using in situ neutron calibration sources and external datasets
from neutron beam experiments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Dual-phase noble liquid time projection chambers
(TPCs) have yielded,
for more than a decade, ever
increasing world leading sensitivity for the search for
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with
mass greater than 10 GeV/c2 [1–5].
In recent years,
the dual-phase technology has been extended to search
for “light” dark matter candidates using the ionization
component only, which allows to explore the sub-keV en-
ergy range. Experiments like XENON1T with a liquid
xenon target [6, 7] and DarkSide-50 with liquid argon
(LAr) [8, 9] have set the best limits on WIMP-nucleus
interactions for Mχ>1.8 GeV/c2 (Mχ>0.1 GeV/c2 ex-
ploiting the Migdal eﬀect), WIMP-electron scattering for
Mχ>30 MeV/c2, and absorption of dark photons and
axion-like particles for Mχ>
∼0.2 keV/c2. This was possi-
ble thanks to the intrinsic radiopurity, and high ioniza-
tion yield and resolution, allowing for detection of single
electrons, of noble liquids.

Unlike xenon, for which there exists a rich set of mea-
surements that characterize its ionization response in the
keV range (see, for instance. Refs [10–14]), the argon re-
sponse is almost unexplored. In spite of the smaller cross
section of WIMP scattering on argon compared to xenon,
due to the lower atomic number, interactions in argon
produce more energetic recoils, with a higher probability
of being detected above the threshold. The potential of
dual-phase LAr TPC technology in direct dark matter
search can therefore be signiﬁcantly enhanced through
a better understanding of the ionization response, espe-
cially in the sub-keV region. This represents the focus
of this paper, through the measurement of the ionization

response to electronic (ER) and nuclear (NR) recoils with
DarkSide-50, using β-decay sources intrinsic to LAr, i.e.
37Ar and 39Ar, and neutron sources located just outside
the TPC, speciﬁcally 241Am-13C and 241Am-11Be.
In
addition, external datasets from beam test experiments
are included in the analysis to better constrain the NR
ionization response. This approach, already adopted in
the so-called DarkSide-50 low-mass analyses published in
2018 [8, 9], is presented in this paper in detail after being
highly reﬁned and improved.

Such calibrations not only have the potential to im-
prove current limits with DarkSide-50, but also provide
a basis for future detectors speciﬁcally designed to search
for light dark matter candidates with LAr.

II. THE DARKSIDE-50 EXPERIMENT

The DarkSide-50 experiment is located in Hall C of
the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy.
The TPC has a cylindrical active LAr target of ∼46 kg
The lateral walls are made of polytetraﬂuoroethylene
(PTFE), surrounded by ﬁeld shaping copper rings. Two
arrays of 19 3-in diameter photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
are located on both ends behind the transparent anode
and cathode respectively. They observe light signals from
both primary scintillation (S1) and electroluminescence
(S2) from ionization electrons, extracted in the gas phase,
after being drifted with a 200 V/cm ﬁeld in liquid. The
extraction eﬃciency is estimated >99.9% at the extrac-
tion ﬁeld of 2.8 kV/cm. The PTFE and the fused silica
windows at the top and bottom of the cylinder are coated
with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), a wavelength shifter,
that absorbs the 128 nm photons emission and re-emits
softer photons with a peak wavelength at 420 nm.

The TPC was ﬁrst operated, between 2013 and 2014,
with atmospheric argon, and then until 2019, with low-

radioactivity argon extracted from deep underground,
naturally shielded against cosmogenic isotope produc-
tion. For a more detailed description of the TPC, see
ref. [15, 16].

The TPC is surrounded by a hermetic neutron veto, a
4 m diameter stainless steel sphere ﬁlled with 30 t of liq-
uid scintillator, loaded with trimethyl borate molecule
(TMB) at 5% mass fraction.
110 8-inch PMTs are
mounted on the inner surface of the sphere to detect
the scintillation light. Neutrons are mostly captured by
10B present in TMB via the 10B(n, α)7Li∗ and 10B(n,
α)7Li reactions, with a mean capture time of ∼22 µs [17],
thanks to the large 10B cross section for thermal neutron.
The ﬁrst reaction, with 93.6% branching ratio, is also re-
sponsible for the emission of a characteristic 478 keV γ
from the 7Li∗ de-excitation, eﬃciently detected thanks
to the relatively high light yield of the scintillator (∼530
pe/MeV).

The neutron veto is in turn immersed in 1000 t of ultra-
pure water, instrumented as a Cherenkov veto against
cosmic muons, and passive shield against external back-
ground. See ref. [17] for more details on the veto system.

III. DETECTOR RESPONSE MODEL

The DarkSide-50 ionization signals are aﬀected by in-
strumental eﬀects,
like the smearing induced by gas-
phase electroluminescence and by the PMT charge re-
sponse. The measured S2 yield (g2), deﬁned as the
mean number of photoelectrons per ionization electron
extracted in the gas pocket, and the associated relative
resolution are 23±1 pe/e− and ∼27%, respectively, for
events localized beneath the central PMT [8]. An addi-
tional instrumental eﬀect is related to the electron life-
time, i.e. the survival time of an electron to the capture
from impurities in LAr along the drift. This was mea-
sured to be about 10 ms, almost 30 times longer than
the maximum drift time in the TPC (376 µs [5]). The
distortion of the ionization signal induced by the electron
lifetime is therefore limited to a few percent.

The dominant instrumental eﬀect is the dependence of
the S2 response on the event radial position on the xy-
plane, orthogonal to the electric ﬁeld. The S2 response
yields a factor of ∼4 diﬀerence between the centre and
the edges of the TPC. This has been assessed using the
41.5 keV line from the 83mKr gas source injected into
the active mass, and applying the position reconstruc-
tion algorithm [18], which provides a sub-cm-level reso-
lution. Such a distortion may be due either to a non-
uniformity of the TPB thickness, on the top fused-silica
window, which would produce non-uniform conversion of
VUV scintillation, or to the sagging of the window itself,
resulting in a varying thickness of the gas pocket, and,
in turn, of the number of electron-luminescence photons
produced.

S2 pulses can be corrected using the radial-dependent
eﬃciency measured with 83mKr data. However, the en-

3

ergy range of interest for the low-mass analysis extends
down to ∼100 eV, where the reconstruction algorithm
is ineﬃcient because of the low number of S2 photoelec-
trons. The analysis published in 2018 [8] overcame this
issue by exploiting a channel-based correction that de-
ﬁnes the event position as that of the top-plane PMT
(Chmax), which observes the largest fraction of photo-
electrons. The position correction based on this deﬁni-
tion is rather coarse, because it does not take the ﬁnite
size (3-inches) of the DarkSide-50 PMTs into account.

To improve the accuracy of the measurement of the
intrinsic LAr response to ionization signals, all eﬀects
mentioned in this section have been incorporated into a
Monte Carlo simulation. This approach has been vali-
dated on a sample of 37Ar decays, naturally present in
LAr. This cosmogenic background decays via a single
electron capture transition, ground-state to ground-state,
with a half-life of 35.01 (2) d [19].

The dominant 37Ar decay branches are from the elec-
tron capture on K (2.83 keV) and L1 (0.277 keV) atomic
shells, with branching ratios of ∼90.4% and ∼8.4%, re-
spectively, determined with the BetaShape code [20, 21]
using the latest recommended Q-value of 813.87 (20) keV
[22]. The emitted cascades of electrons, X-rays, and
UV photons are evaluated with the RELAX software [23],
based on the latest EADL2017 library of atomic transition
data [24]. RELAX calculates atomic relaxation spectra of
UV photons, X-rays and Auger electrons, hereafter re-
ferred to as “primaries”, due to bound-state-to-bound-
state transitions for a single initial vacancy in the diﬀer-
ent sub-shells. From the atomic transition probabilities,
a deterministic step-by-step propagation of the vacancies
was made up to the valence shell and to the neutral-
ization. Atomic conﬁguration has been accounted for,
rejecting transitions that would require more electrons
in a sub-shell than those actually present.
It should
be underlined that the only information available in the
EADL2017 library is for a single atomic vacancy. In prin-
ciple, each additional vacancy due to an Auger transition
would require a complete recalculation of the atomic en-
ergies, wave functions and transition probabilities, which
is not considered in this work.

The relaxation paths estimated by RELAX are 5213 and
72 for the K and L1 shells, respectively. Each contri-
bution is determined per initial vacancy and weighted by
the corresponding capture probability. The average ener-
gies of Auger electrons, UV photons and X-rays grouped
by shell, are quoted in Table I. We can assume that the
primary particle is almost always an electron, either be-
cause directly emitted or because extracted by X-rays
or UV photons via photoelectric eﬀect. The K- and L1-
shells emit, on average 3.9 and 2.8 primaries, respectively,
neglecting UV photons with energy not suﬃcient to pho-
toionize an 40Ar atom. To evaluate the ionization yield,
the mean number of primaries will be subtracted from
the number of detected electrons, as primaries are also
drifted and extracted in the gas pocket and contribute to
the S2 signal.

All energies are expressed in eV.

FIG. 1. Comparison between the best ﬁtted simulated spec-
trum and 37Ar data as a function of the reconstructed number
of electrons. The free parameters in the model are the mean
number of ionization electrons induced by the 37Ar L1- and
K-shell electrons, and the Fano factor.

The two lines from K and L1 electron capture are ob-
served in the DarkSide-50 data by subtracting the latest
∼500 days of the underground argon campaign dataset
(from 2015 to 2018), where 37Ar is almost entirely de-
cayed, from the ﬁrst ∼100 days, normalizing the two sam-
ples by their livetimes. The subtracted spectrum is ﬁt-
ted with simulated spectra, generated by independently
varying the average number of detected electrons (Ne)
for each of the two 37Ar lines. Events are simulated with
a uniform spatial distribution in the TPC. The intrinsic
ﬂuctuations induced by the number of emitted particles
and by the LAr ionization response to ERs are modelled
with an empirical fudge factor implemented as a Fano fac-
tor [25]. In the Monte Carlo, a fraction of electrons is sup-
pressed according to the electron lifetime. The surviving
free electrons are extracted in the gas pocket with 100%
eﬃciency, and converted into S2 photoelectrons with g2
that varies depending on the xy-position of the event,
according to relative eﬃciency derived with the 83mKr
calibration source.

The ﬁt is performed with a χ2 analysis, where the free
parameters are the numbers of extracted electrons in-
duced by the two 37Ar lines and the Fano factor.
It
is worth mentioning that no additional correction is ap-
plied to the resolution model. The shoulder-like struc-
ture observed at ∼35 e− in Figure 1 originates from the
non-uniform radial response of the detector and is well
reproduced by the Monte Carlo starting from input pa-
rameters only.

The best-ﬁtted simulated spectrum is shown in Figure 1
together with data, as a function of the reconstructed
number of electrons. The ﬁt returns a reduced χ2 of
82.4 / 64.

The ratio between the measured amplitudes of the two
lines, equal to 0.10±0.01, is in excellent agreement with
∼0.093, the expected value determined with BetaShape,
and with measured values in literature (0.103±0.003 [26],
0.102±0.004 [27], 0.098±0.003 [28]).

The ﬁtted Fano factor, 0.10±0.03, is compatible with
predictions on the LAr ionization ﬂuctuation from the
Shockley (0.107) and the Alkhazov (0.116) models [29].
This result suggests that intrinsic ﬂuctuations of the
number of particles emitted in atomic cascades are neg-
ligible compared to the ionization ﬂuctuation.

As already mentioned, in order to extract the number
of ionization electrons from the two lines, the number of
emitted primaries in the atomic cascades must be sub-
tracted from the number of detected electrons.
In the
L1–shell cascade, the mean number of primaries is 2.8.
The 25 eV UV has high probability of extracting an elec-
tron by photoionization, but with insuﬃcient energy to
induce additional ionization electrons.

The 51 eV M-shell electron is suﬃciently energetic to
ionize up to two atoms. The Thomas-Imel model, dis-
cussed in the following section, predicts a suppressed ion-
electron recombination probability at such low ionization
densities [30], a ﬁnding conﬁrmed by numerical simula-
tions [31]. Yet the energy lost to excitations is unknown
at such low energies. Therefore because of uncertainties
on the ionization mechanism, we conservatively assume
that the 51 eV line contributes with 1±1 ionization elec-
trons to the L1-shell cascade.
In addition, we assume
negligible interactions between the 51 eV and the L-shell
179 eV electron-ion clouds because of their low ionization
density. The resulting number of ionization electron at
179 eV is 8.2±1.3, where the uncertainty takes into ac-
count both statistical and systematic errors, correspond-
ing to a ionization yield of 45.7±7.0 e−/keVer.

Unlike the L1–shell, the superposition of ∼3 ion-
electron clouds from K–shell electrons of 2414 eV (or 2634
eV X-rays) and 179 eV (1.8 multiplicity) cannot be ne-

the complex event topology does not allow to estimate
the overall recombination eﬀect. For this reason, we do
not include data from 37Ar K–shell in the analysis, dis-
cussed in the following section, for the determination of
the ER ionization yield.

IV. ELECTRONIC RECOIL IONIZATION
YIELD

The calibration of the ER energy scale relies on 37Ar
data, discussed in the previous section, and on the cos-
mogenic 39Ar β−-decay sample from the 2013-2014 at-
mospheric argon (AAr) campaign [15], acquired with the
same drift ﬁeld of 200 V/cm. In AAr, 39Ar has a speciﬁc
activity of ∼1 Bq/kg [15], and dominates the event rate.
To suppress the “external” background from radioactiv-
ity in detector materials surrounding the active mass,
events are selected within a central cylinder with 2 cm
radius and 21.6 cm height, 16.8 cm far from the lateral
walls and 7 cm from the top and bottom of the TPC. The
very narrow cut in radius selects events corresponding to
the innermost area of the central PMT only, minimiz-
ing the non-uniformity of the detector response. To fur-
ther remove residual external contamination, events with
more than one S2 pulse are rejected. These are multiple
scatter events, and not compatible with the topology of
the 39Ar β-decay signature.

The kinetic energy of each event is reconstructed ex-
ploiting the full anti-correlation between the S1 and S2
signals, through the so-called “rotated” energy variable

where w=19.5±1.0 eV [32] is the average energy required

which accounts for the subtraction of the primary elec-
tron from the β-decay. The mean value of the ER ion-
ization yield, QER
, is estimated using eqs. 1 and 2 for
each 0.2–keVer bin. A lower threshold of Eer>1.7 keV is
applied to guarantee 100% eﬃciency in the identiﬁcation
of the S1 pulse. The uncertainty is dominated by the
systematics from the g2 parameter.

where γ is a free parameter describing the recombination
of the initial electron-ion pairs contained in a box and

work well in noble liquids for spatially short tracks [33],
in the O(keVer) range for ERs. In this range, Eq. 3 can
be parametrized as

with ρ=Ni/Eer and γ the free parameters of the model.
γ can be expressed as Cbox/F , where F is the drift ﬁeld
(200 V/cm) and Cbox depends on the mean ionization
electron velocity and on the size of the ideal box con-
taining the electron-ion cloud. In this parameterization,
we assume the approximation of a constant excitation-
to-ionization ratio, which implies that Ni is proportional
to the deposited energy [18]. The impact of this approx-
imation is discussed at the end of this section.

39Ar data, together with the 37Ar calibration line, are
ﬁtted with Eq. 5 up to 3 keVer. As shown in Figure 2,
the Thomas-Imel box model is in good agreement with
37Ar and 39Ar data points with Eer<3 keVer.

The extension of the model to higher energies through
the empirical Doke-Birks parameterization [34], in good
agreement with data from the ARIS experiment above

3–20 keVer range. Instead, the agreement with 39Ar data

It is worth highlighting that
the extrapolation of the ER ionization yield below
the lowest measured energy (179 eVer from the 37Ar
L1-shell electron) is weakly dependent on the custom
term introduced in Eq. 6 as it is mainly driven by the
Thomas-Imel box model.

To test

the impact of

the constant excitation-
to-ionization ratio assumption, an energy-dependent
parametrization was introduced in Eq. 6, so that

is a sigmoid function tending to the excitation-to-
ionization ratio (Nex/Ni) of 0.21, as measured at high
energies [34]. The ﬁt of 37Ar and 39Ar data, assuming
the change of variable as in eq. 7, requires two additional
free parameters, and does not lead to signiﬁcant varia-
tions of QER
y with respect to the constant ρ approxima-
tion. Therefore, we conclude that data are not sensitive
to either assumption and opt to retain the formalism with
constant Nex/Ni that represents the simplest model.

where the electron recombination probability, r, is de-

Under the assumption that the excitation-to-ionization

ratio is constant, Ni can be expressed [36] as:

Ni = β κ((cid:15)) = β

(cid:15) se((cid:15))
sn((cid:15)) + se((cid:15))

(10)

where β is a normalization constant taken as the second
free parameter of the model together with Cbox. The

6

dimensionless parameter κ represents the energy lost in
electronic excitations giving rise to ionization and scin-
tillation signals. se is the rate at which electrons are ex-
cited by inelastic collisions while sn is the rate at which
energy is transferred to recoiling nuclei by elastic colli-
sions. They all depend on the dimensionless parameter
((cid:15)) deﬁned as:

(cid:15) =

where the Thomas-Fermi screening length a = 0.626 · a0 ·
Z −1/3 [36] is used with a0 = ¯h/(αmec) (cid:39) 0.529 · 105 fm.
The stopping power, se, can be expressed as [36]:

where F (v/v0) is a correction factor dependent on the
nuclear (v) and Bohr (v0 = e2/¯h) velocities. With no
available theoretical calculation backing either a suppres-
sion or an enhancement of the electronic stopping power,
we assume F (v/v0)=1. However, at the end of this sec-
tion, we deﬁne an ad-hoc function as in Ref. [36] to test
the sensitivity of the calibration data to a potential sup-
pression of se((cid:15)) at low energies.

The nuclear stopping power, sn, is modelled by Ziegler

et al. using an universal screening function [37]:

sn((cid:15)) =

ln(1 + 1.1383fZ (cid:15))
2[fZ (cid:15) + 0.01321(fZ (cid:15))0.21226 + 0.19593(fZ (cid:15))0.5]
(13)
where fZ (cid:39) 0.953 is a conversion factor for argon that
accounts for the slightly diﬀerent dimensionless energy
deﬁnition used in Ref. [37] compared to Eq (11).

The NR response model is applied to simulated events
analogously to what done for ERs in Section III. The only
diﬀerence is in the intrinsic resolution of the NR ioniza-
tion process. Following the procedure used in Ref. [8], we
considered two extreme models: one allowing for ﬂuctu-
ations in energy quenching, ionization yield, and recom-
bination processes obtained with binomial distributions,
and an other where the ﬂuctuations in energy quench-
ing are set to zero. The analysis described in the below
cannot distinguish between the two models, as the diﬀer-
ence in the results is negligible. For this reason, in the
following, we only consider the model without quenching
ﬂuctuations.

DarkSide-50 calibration data, using 241Am-13C and
241Am-9Be neutron sources [38], acquired during the un-
derground argon (UAr) campaign, and external datasets
from the SCENE [39], ARIS [35], and Joshi et al.

experiments, as described in the following.

>10−9, as quoted in [42], are simulated with G4DS [18],
the DarkSide-50 Monte Carlo, to derive the spectrum of
AmC uncorrelated events. The detector response is ap-
plied as described in Section III.

The AmC NR analysis is performed on events with
Chmax corresponding to channels 24, 25, 30, and 31, the
4 central PMTs less exposed to the source, as shown
in Figure 3, with 241Am γ contamination minimized
to 5.2%, as estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation.
Events selected by channels 26, 29, and 35 (see Figure 3)
are excluded from the analysis because of the high rate of
241Am γs. Events not correlated with the source are sub-
tracted using data from the UAr campaign, selected with
the same Chmax cuts and normalized by the livetime.

Figure 4 shows AmC and UAr data spectra, the lat-
ter normalized by the livetime, and the simulated spec-
trum of γ-events from 241Am reaching the TPC. The
uncertainty on the source position aﬀects the amplitude
of the simulated spectrum, which is then normalized to
the UAr–subtracted AmC spectrum in the [250, 900] Ne
range, where no NR event is expected. The excess of
events from the source, shown in Figure 4, with respect to
the TPC intrinsic contamination and to simulated 241Am
γ-rays, is attributed to neutron scatterings.

B.

241Am-9Be data selection

The 241Am-9Be source (from now on AmBe) emits neu-
trons in association with the emission of, among others,
4.4 MeV γs. The prompt γ signal is detected in the liquid
scintillator veto [17], where the source is deployed. Most
neutrons, once scattered in the TPC LAr target, escape
the TPC given the low neutron capture cross section in
40Ar. Scattered neutrons that reach the neutron veto are
mostly captured by 10B with 22 µs mean time.

NRs in the TPC are selected with a three-fold coin-
cidence by looking at the prompt 4.4 MeV γ, followed
by a single-scatter signal in the TPC within a few tens

FIG. 3. Schematic top view of the detector. The source holder
is located in the liquid scintillator veto. Source events have to
cross the cryostat, the LAr buﬀer and the PTFE walls before
reaching the active mass. Events whose position is associ-
ated to channels in the outer ring (white) are not included in
this analysis. Only events with maximum fraction of light ob-
served by PMTs highlighted in green in the ﬁgure are included
in the AmC analysis. The analysis of the AmBe source is ex-
tended also to events selected by PMTs highlighted in red.

A.

241Am-13C data selection

The 241Am-13C (from now on AmC) neutron source
[41] is located outside the DarkSide-50 cryostat, in the
liquid scintillator veto, as shown in Figure 3. The source
emits neutrons via (α, n) on 13C, producing 16O in
the ground level in the ﬁnal state. First or second ex-
cited states, accompanied by γ emission from 16O∗ de-
excitation, are suppressed by a thin degrader, which re-
duces the α energy below that needed to reach the lowest
excited state of 16O.

A 2 mm thick lead shielding absorbs 241Am X-rays,
resulting in a neutron source with very low correlation
with γ and X emission. However, to compensate for the
low eﬃciency in neutron production, the 241Am activ-
ity is rather high (∼3.6 MBq), producing pile-up X-rays
and γs with a non-negligible probability of escaping the
shielding and reaching the active volume of DarkSide-
50, crossing the cryostat, the LAr buﬀer surrounding the
TPC, the ﬁeld-shaping copper rings, and the PTFE walls
housing the active volume.

The 241Am γ-ray with the highest branching ratio
(35.9%) has an energy of 59.5 keV that falls in the regime
dominated by the photoelectric eﬀect and is fully ab-
sorbed in the LAr buﬀer and preceding materials. 241Am

expected in the S1 eﬃciency, as shown in Figure 5.

Prompt signals in the veto are selected by requiring an
electron equivalent energy in the [4, 5] MeV range, and
a time diﬀerence with respect to the TPC between -600
and -500 ns, taking into account the time oﬀset of -550 ns
between veto and TPC. The delayed signal is selected
in the [10, 45] µs time window, and with event energy
in the [370, 510] keV range, a range properly tuned to
account for quenching eﬀects and γ energy deposition
in passive materials. The 10 µs low time threshold is
applied to avoid veto PMT afterpulses. The selection
cuts are shown in Figure 6.

The AmBe events selected in triple coincidence still
suﬀer from a residual contamination due to accidental
ERs. Such a contamination is account for by looking in
control region where no NR is expected. The control re-
gion is deﬁned selecting events with Ne in the [200, 500]
range and with f90<0.4, where f90 is the pulse shape dis-
crimination estimator of DarkSide-50 [15], less than 0.4,
a region where no NR is expected. The UAr spectrum
is normalized with respect to the same selection criteria,
and subtracted from the AmBe one. The contributions
from AmBe and non-source events are shown in Figure
7.

C. External datasets

A further constraint to the LAr response to the ioniza-
tion signal is provided by “external” datasets, i.e. mea-
surements perfomed with small scale LAr detectors ex-
posed to neutron beams. The SCENE collaboration [39]
measured the ionization yield for 4 NR energies, between
16.9 and 57.3 keV, with g2=3.1±0.3 pe/e−. The drift
ﬁeld at 193 V/cm is very close to one used in DarkSide-
50 (200 V/cm), and the diﬀerence is assumed negligi-
ble in this analysis. SCENE results are normalized to
the DarkSide-50 response by the ratio between the cor-
responding g2’s.

FIG. 6. Veto selection of prompt (blue box) and delayed (red
box) events associated to AmBe neutron emission, as a func-
tion of liquid scintillator veto (LSV) visible energy and time

oﬀset between the two detectors is about -550 ns. The hori-
zontal feature at the 4.3 µs oﬀset is due to PMT afterpulses.

of nanoseconds, in turn followed by the delayed neutron
capture in the veto.
In order to apply this selection,
events with both S1 and S2 pulses are required. The
events with S2 signal only, in fact, are delayed by the
drift time up to a maximum of 376 µs, much longer than
the coincidence time with the prompt signal in the veto,
which, in most cases, falls outside the acquisition window.
On the contrary, the S1 signal is very fast, and allows not
to miss the coincidence with the prompt signal in the
veto. The requirement of an S1 signal, however, implies
an energy threshold, dictated by the S1 trigger and pulse-
ﬁnder eﬃciencies. The overall eﬃciency for NR events is
deﬁned as the ratio between 2-pulses events (S1+S2) and
all events with either S2-only or S1+S2. The eﬃciency is
extracted from the AmC dataset, by subtracting the ER
contamination from each of the two S2-only and S1+S2
samples. The resulting eﬃciency, which from now on
is named S1 detection eﬃciency, is ﬁtted with an error
function, which takes into account Gaussian ﬂuctuations

scintillation response at 200 V/cm for 8 NR energies,
between 7.1 and 117.8 keV. ARIS S1 data at 200 V/cm
are rescaled to the DarkSide-50 response by the ratio be-
tween ﬁeld-oﬀ S1 yields of DarkSide-50 (8.0±0.1 pe/keV)
and ARIS (6.35±0.05 pe/keV). This allows to associate
the NR nominal energies from ARIS to the correspondent
S1 at 200 V/cm in DarkSide-50. The ﬁnal step is the con-
version of the so-obtained S1 values to S2, by looking at
the S2/S1 ratio from NRs selected with the triple coin-
cidence in the AmBe dataset. The correlation between
S1 and S2 signals for the AmBe source was accounted
for by means of Monte Carlo simulations, which embeds
the DarkSide-50 energy and optical response models [18].
The resulting ionization yield is slightly lower at low en-
ergies than that published in 2018 [8]. This diﬀerence is
due to the improved modelling of the detector response.
[40] have measured the ionization yield
of NRs at 6.7 keV using the endpoint of a spectrum in-
duced by monochromatic 70 keV neutrons from a beam.
The measurement at 240 V/cm, the closest ﬁeld to the
DarkSide-50 one, results in Qy=3.6+0.5
−1.1 e−/keV. How-
ever, after consulting with the authors, the data point
is corrected for their single electron yield using the 2.82
keV K-shell capture 37Ar line from their experiment and
DarkSide-50 as a cross-calibration point. The corrected
value is then Qy=6.0+0.8
−1.8 e−/keV. However, because of
this correction, we preferred not to include the measure-
ment by Joshi et al. in this analysis, but to quote it in
the comparison with the ﬁnal result.

D. Global ﬁt to data

The energy Monte Carlo spectra for ﬁtting both AmC
and AmBe data samples are generated with G4DS, which
accurately describes detector and source geometries, with
a statistics of about 105 neutron events, between 1 and
2 orders of magnitude higher than the data statistics.
The detector response is applied with a toy Monte Carlo
approach, as described earlier, by varying β and Cbox
parameters from the model with a ﬁne scan. In addition,
in order to take into account the ineﬃciency on S1 pulses,
the eﬃciency curve shown in Figure 5 is applied to AmBe
simulated events as a function of Ne.

The AmC and AmBe datasets are simultaneously ﬁt-
ted with a χ2 analysis in the [3, 250] Ne range. The ﬁt
includes g2 as an additional ﬁt parameter constrained to
the measured value within its uncertainty. To minimize
the statistical ﬂuctuations, the χ2 value is averaged over
800 toy simulations for each (β, Cbox) parameter pair.
The resulting χ2 map in the (β, Cbox) parameter space
is summed to the one from the simultaneous ﬁt of the
external datasets from SCENE and ARIS presented in
the previous section.

The resulting best parameters of such a global ﬁt are

rors on the model are from statistical uncertainties and
systematic error on g2. The QN R
extracted from ex-
ternal datasets only is in excellent agreement with the
one from AmC and AmBe calibrations, as shown in Fig-
ure 8, and the reduced χ2 from combined ﬁt of all the
datasets is equal to 1.34 (χ2/NDF = 676/506). Figure 9
shows the comparison between data and model, for both
AmC and AmBe, assuming best ﬁtted parameters. The
model is constrained at low energy by the AmC calibra-
tion data, with a minimum energy value of 435+47
−34 eVnr,
corresponding to 3 electrons. This is the lowest NR cali-
bration threshold ever achieved in LAr.

Regarding potential systematics, we have investigated
the impact of S1 detection eﬃciency on the result for 5
low thresholds, ranging from 0 to 40 Ne, applied to the
AmBe dataset. The results obtained by repeating the ﬁt
for each threshold are in agreement within 1 σ with the
one without threshold, conﬁrming that the S1 detection
eﬃciency does not induce any appreciable systematics.

E. Sensitivity to other theoretical models

We have investigated the sensitivity of our data to dif-
ferent models of the nuclear stopping power as a function
of energy stemming from diﬀerent assumption on screen-
ing eﬀects from atomic electrons. This is encapsulated
in screening functions arising from diﬀerent models that
can be written as [36]

bands correspond to 1σ uncertainty.

Following the same conservative approach, we also ex-
plored the impact of a low-energy se suppression by in-
troducing the functional form of F (v/v0) in eq. 12 as
suggested in [36]:

F (v/v0) = 1/2 (1 + tanh(50 (cid:15) − z)),

(16)

where F (v/v0)→1 for z → −∞. Setting z = 0.25 enables
to reproduce the attempt in [46] to include Coulomb ef-
fects in the calculation of the electronic stopping power.
Such a suppression, demonstrated to be not compatible
with existing LXe datasets [36], aﬀects the energy range
in LAr below ∼3 keVnr, as shown in Figure 11. Through
a null hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis corre-
sponds to F (v/v0)=1, we veriﬁed that low energy AmC
data have the power to constrain suppression eﬀect to be
within ∼18% (2 σ) at 1 keVnr below the nominal charge
yield derived from the universal function. This test al-

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we presented the calibration of the LAr
ionization response to electronic and nuclear recoils in
the keV region at 200 V/cm with DarkSide-50. The
electronic recoil one is measured down to 179 eVer, the
energy of the L1-shell Auger electron from 37Ar, and ex-
trapolated down to few tens of eV by ﬁtting data with the
Thomas-Imel box model. The nuclear recoil ionization
response is measured with a low threshold of ∼500 eVnr,
corresponding to 3 ionization electrons, the lowest ever
performed in LAr. The measured ER and NR ioniza-
tion yields will impact direct dark matter searches with
LAr, extending the observation window to low-mass can-
didates, like Weakly Interacting Massive Particles of few
GeV/c2 mass, axion-like particles, dark photons and ster-
ile neutrinos, and to neutrino bursts from core-collapse
supernovae [47]. Dedicated campaigns of measurement

the ﬁt using the diﬀerent screening functions are shown

for two cases, Ziegler et al. and Moli`ere, is shown in

The Ziegler et al. model is the one yielding the low-
est QN R
in the region of interest for WIMP analysis.
Therefore the adoption of this model will result in the
more conservative choice for the sensitivity to WIMPs in
future DarkSide searches.
