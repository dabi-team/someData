Solar ﬂares — bursts of high-energy radiation responsible for severe
space-weather effects — are a consequence of the occasional desta-
bilization of magnetic ﬁelds rooted in active regions (ARs). The com-
plexity of AR evolution is a barrier to a comprehensive understand-
ing of ﬂaring processes and accurate prediction. Though machine
learning (ML) has been used to improve ﬂare predictions, the poten-
tial for revealing precursors and associated physics has been under-
exploited. Here, we train ML algorithms to classify between vector-
magnetic-ﬁeld observations from ﬂaring ARs, producing at least one
M-/X-class ﬂare, and non-ﬂaring ARs. Analysis of magnetic-ﬁeld ob-
servations accurately classiﬁed by the machine presents statistical
evidence for (1) ARs persisting in ﬂare-productive states — charac-
terized by AR area — for days, before and after M- and X-class ﬂare
events, (2) systematic pre-ﬂare build-up of free energy in the form of
electric currents, suggesting that associated subsurface magnetic
ﬁeld is twisted, (3) intensiﬁcation of Maxwell stresses in the corona
above newly emerging ARs, days before ﬁrst ﬂares. These results
provide new insights into ﬂare physics and improving ﬂare forecast-
ing.

Solar Flares | Space Weather | Solar Magnetic Fields | Machine Learning

By virtue of buoyancy, magnetic ﬁelds generated in the interior

of the Sun rise to the photosphere - the visible solar surface -
and emerge as bipolar active regions (ARs) (1, 2). Emerging ﬂux
and electric currents energize coronal magnetic ﬁeld that is rooted
in ARs (3). Magnetic reconnection occasionally releases free energy
built up in the coronal loops in violent events such as solar ﬂares
(4, 5). M- and X-class ﬂares, producing X-Ray ﬂux > 10−5 W-m−2
and > 10−4 W-m−2 respectively as measured by Geostationary
and Environmental Satellite (GOES), can have severe space weather
consequences (6). Operational ﬂare forecasts are based on subjective
analyses of AR morphology (7–9). Reliable precursors for accurate
ﬂare forecasting, however, remain elusive (10).

The complex nature of AR dynamics hinders straightforward in-
terpretation of ﬂare observations, though AR magnetic-ﬁeld features
related to ﬂare activity are known from case and statistical studies
(11–13). Recurrent ﬂares are found to be associated with continuously
emerging magnetic ﬂux (14). ARs producing M- and X-class ﬂares
contain a prominent high-gradient region separating opposite polari-
ties (15). Magnetic helicity and electric current is found to be accumu-
lated in ARs prior to major ﬂares (16, 17). Minutes before the onset
of ﬂares, increased Lorentz forces in ARs are observed as a result of
elevated pressure from the coronal magnetic ﬁeld (18, 19). Such AR
features can be quantiﬁed using photospheric vector-magnetic-ﬁeld
data (20) from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI (21)) on
board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO (22)).

ML — efﬁcient in classifying, recognizing and interpreting pat-
terns in high-dimensional data sets — have been applied to predict
ﬂares using many AR features simultaneously. Such studies are aimed
at developing reliable forecasting method and identifying features

most relevant to ﬂare activity (23–26), obtaining new AR features
that yield better forecasting accuracy (25, 27) and comparing perfor-
mances of different ML algorithms (28). Flare prediction accuracy is
expected to depend on forward-looking time i.e. how far in advance
ﬂares can be predicted. Existing studies, which use AR observa-
tions ranging from 1-48 hours prior to ﬂares, however suggest that
forecasting accuracy is largely insensitive to forward-looking time
(24, 27, 29). Thus ﬂaring ARs may exist in a ﬂare-productive state
long before producing a ﬂare. This motivates the present work where
we explicitly train ML algorithms to classify between photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. The trained machine
builds a correlation (probability distribution function) between AR
photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and ﬂaring activity in AR coronal loops.
We analyze time evolution of machine correlation between AR mag-
netic ﬁelds and ﬂaring activity to investigate a) whether magnetic
ﬁelds from ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs are intrinsically different, b)
statistical evolution in ﬂaring ARs days before and after ﬂares, as well
as c) the development of emerging ARs days before ﬁrst ﬂares.

We consider ARs between May 2010 - Apr 2016. Using the GOES
X-ray ﬂux catalog, we identify ARs that produce at least one M- or
X-class ﬂare during its passage across the visible solar disk as ﬂaring
and otherwise as non-ﬂaring. We only consider ARs with maximum
observed area > 25 Mm2. This restriction serves to eliminate thou-
sands of very small-scale non-ﬂaring ARs and no ﬂaring AR. We
represent AR photospheric magnetic ﬁelds by 12 features, listed in

Signiﬁcance Statement

Reliable ﬂare forecasting is essential for improving prepared-
ness for severe space-weather consequences. Flares also
serve as probes of solar magnetic processes and the emer-
gence of ﬂux at the solar surface. Training Machine Learning
(ML) algorithms using magnetic-ﬁeld observations for improving
ﬂare forecasting has been extensively studied in prior literature.
Instead, here we use ML to understand the underlying mech-
anisms governing ﬂares. We train ML algorithms to classify
ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs with high ﬁdelity and, for the ﬁrst
time, report statistical trends for AR evolution days before and
after M- and X-class ﬂares. These trends are interpreted in
terms of existing models of sub-surface magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂux
emergence. Our results also provide hypotheses for achieving
reliable ﬂare forecasting.

Table 1a, computed from HMI magnetograms every 12 minutes (SI
Appendix, Table S1). These features are publicly available in the data-
product Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) (30)
and produce optimum ﬂare forecasting performance (24). Using ML,
we classify whether a given magnetic-ﬁeld observation, represented
by SHARP features, corresponds to a ﬂaring or non-ﬂaring AR. Part
of the available data are used to train the machine and validate the
performance. The trained machine is then used to classify and analyze
magnetic ﬁelds of ARs in the remaining unseen data — the test data.
Formally, the trained machine gives an optimum mapping X → Y
where X is a 12-dimensional SHARP feature vector and Y ∈ {1, 0}
is the machine prediction. Y = 1 implies that the AR has ﬂared or is
about to, and Y = 0 implies that the AR belongs to the non-ﬂaring
population. For ﬂaring ARs, SHARP feature vectors that yield Y = 1
are True Positives (TP) and Y = 0 are False Negatives (FN). For
non-ﬂaring ARs, SHARP feature vectors that yield Y = 0 are True
Negatives (TN) and Y = 1 are False Positives (FP). We statistically
analyze time series of SHARP feature vectors X(t) from TP and FN
populations days before and after ﬂares.

Results

Classiﬁcation of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring active regions: We
chronologically split the available AR data in two parts. The training
and validation data comprises of ARs between May 2010 - Dec 2013
and the test data comprises of ARs between Jan 2014 - Apr 2016. We
explicitly study the development of newly emerged ARs, identiﬁed
from the ﬁrst recorded observation within ±60° of the central merid-
ian. Between May 2010 - Apr 2016, only 22 ﬂaring ARs emerged on
the visible solar disk, hence, all ‘emerging ARs’ are included in the
test data. The total number of ARs considered are listed in Table 1b.
We consider observations from ﬂaring ARs which are within ±72
hours of M- or X-class ﬂares for training. Note that all magnetic
ﬁeld observations from ARs in the training and validation data are not
needed in order to optimally train the machines. Instead, we pick an
observation every 96 min from within ±6 hours of ﬂares and every
864 min otherwise (within ±72 hours of ﬂares). For non-ﬂaring ARs,
we pick an observation every 900 min for training. The choice of these
time intervals is inconsequential to the results as long as the number of
AR observation samples is adequate for training. For robust training,

hours prior to ﬂares. For comparison, machine identiﬁcation error rate (false-positive
rate) for non-ﬂaring ARs in the test data hY i is ∼ 0.1 (Table 2). Shaded area

we apply 10-fold cross-validation. We randomly split the ﬂaring and
non-ﬂaring ARs in the training and validation data in 10 parts and use
observations from ARs in 9 parts for training and remaining part for
validation. This process is repeated 10 times. Thus, we avoid mixing
AR observations in the training and validation sets and thereby avoid
artiﬁcially boosting the machine performance (28). Total number of
observations used for training from ﬂaring ARs and non-ﬂaring ARs
are 768 and 4323 respectively (SI Appendix, Table S2).

A straightforward performance measure for classiﬁcation problems
is accuracy, deﬁned as the fraction of correctly classiﬁed observations
i.e. accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FN + FP + TN). However, there
are 5 times as many non-ﬂaring as ﬂaring ARs in the training and
validation data. Hence, the classiﬁcation problem considered here is
class-imbalanced and accuracy is not useful (24). Recall, deﬁned as
the accuracy for each class is a more relevant performance metric. For

training and validation dataset, we compare performance of three ML
algorithms — Logistic Regression (Logit), Support Vector Machines

of the time-evolving correlation between SHARP features and ﬂare
activity, obtained using the trained machine. Similarly, the machine
predictions can be obtained for all observations from non-ﬂaring ARs.
Since there is no characteristic time event on non-ﬂaring ARs we
ﬁnd the average machine prediction deﬁned as hY i = (1/N ) PN
i Yi.
hY i is time and population average over all N non-ﬂaring AR obser-
vations and gives false-positive rate.

Time evolution of machine prediction: We are particularly inter-
ested in time evolution of magnetic ﬁelds in ﬂaring ARs, hence we
obtain recall of the machine prediction on time series of observations
from ﬂaring ARs. A time series X(t) of SHARP feature vectors rep-
resenting continuous AR observations yields a time series of machine
prediction Y (t). Flares are known to be temporally clustered (31) and
hence we focus on evolution within ±72 hours of ﬂares. We compile
time series of observations during a window t−TF ∈ [−72, 72] hours
centered around a ﬂare event TF . Whenever two consecutive ﬂares
on an AR are separated by < 144 hours, we split the observations
between the ﬂare events in two halves and consider the ﬁrst half as the
post-ﬂare category of the ﬁrst ﬂare and the second half as belonging to
the pre-ﬂare category of the second ﬂare. We align all such time series
from ﬂaring ARs at t − TF = tr = 0, the time of ﬂare events, yield-
ing co-temporal X(tr) and Y (tr) time series for time tr with respect
to the ﬂare. The machine prediction averaged over the ﬂaring-AR
population Y (tr) = (1/N (tr)) PN (tr )
i=1 Yi(tr) gives instantaneous
recall or identiﬁcation rate at time tr. Here, N (tr) is number of
magnetic-ﬁeld observations available at time tr from the ﬂaring-AR
population (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Thus, recall Y (tr) is a measure

We can now obtain time evolution of machine prediction for ﬂaring
ARs in the test data using the trained SVM. Note that none of the
observations from the test data were considered during training and
cross-validation of the machine, i.e. SVM, performance. Thus all
observations in the test data are previously ‘unseen’ by the machine.
Similar to the training data, recall or identiﬁcation rate is consistently
high (> 0.6) for days before and after ﬂares for ﬂaring ARs in the
test data (Fig. 1). This indicates that ﬂaring ARs persist in a ﬂare-
productive state for days before and after ﬂares. With proximity to
ﬂares, identiﬁcation rate increases to a maximum of 0.91, 24-hours
before ﬂare. This recall value is comparable to reported results of
ﬂare forecasting using ML (24) and signiﬁcantly higher than recall
∼ 0.55 obtained through operational forecasts based on subjective
AR analyses (as estimated by (9)).

hours before and after ﬂares (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Hence, we obtain
time- and population-averaged machine prediction hY if laring =
(1/Nf laring) PNf laring
Yi, where Nf laring is number of all ﬂaring
AR observations separated from ﬂares > 72 hours. hY if laring thus
gives recall for such ﬂaring AR observations. Similarly, recall for
non-ﬂaring ARs is obtained by 1 − hY inon−f laring. Time- and
population-average values of recall for ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs
are reported in Table 2. The high value of recall ∼ 0.75 even for
observations separated from ﬂares > 72 hours suggests that SHARP
features derived from magnetic ﬁelds of ﬂaring ARs are statistically
signiﬁcantly different from non-ﬂaring ARs.

Evolution of magnetic ﬁelds in ﬂaring active regions We have
trained an SVM to distinguish between SHARP features derived
from magnetic ﬁelds in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs with high ﬁdelity.
To understand magnetic ﬁeld evolution in ARs, we analyze TP and
FN populations from ﬂaring ARs and TN and FP populations from
non-ﬂaring ARs, as categorized by the machine. We include SHARP
features from all ARs in the training and validation data as well as
the test data. In Table 3, time- and population-average values of
SHARP features over ﬂaring AR observations separated from ﬂares
> 72 hours and non-ﬂaring AR observations are listed. As expected,
average TP (also FP) values are strikingly higher than average TN
(also FN) values. This difference is listed in terms of standard de-
viation of average TN values for each of the SHARP parameters,
in the last column in Table 3. Total unsigned ﬂux (USFLUX) and
total unsigned current helicity (TOTUSJH) are leading contributors to
machine classiﬁcation. Whereas, mean free energy (MEANPOT) and
area with shear > 45° (SHRGT45) minimally inﬂuence the classiﬁca-
tion. Also, SHARP features that lead classiﬁcation between ﬂaring
and non-ﬂaring ARs are an extensive measure of AR magnetic ﬁeld.

Categories of SHARP features are further highlighted by the Pear-
son correlation matrix in Fig. 2. Strongly correlated features are
divided in the following groups a) extensive features: area, total
unsigned ﬂux, total free energy, total Lorentz force, total unsigned
vertical current and total unsigned current helicity, b) features that
scale with electric current in AR: absolute net current helicity and
sum of net current per polarity, c) measures of AR non-potential en-
ergy: mean free energy and area with shear > 45° d) sum of ﬂux
near polarity inversion line (15) and e) vertical Lorentz force on AR.
From Table 3, we see that the extensive features dominate machine
classiﬁcation, followed by the features that scale with electric current.
Meanwhile, features that scale with AR mean non-potential energy
contribute the least.

SHARP features from each of the groups above characteristically
evolve before and after ﬂares. For the m-th entry of each SHARP
feature vector, we calculate the time evolution of population-averaged
value X m(tr), before and after ﬂares, over TP and FN ﬂaring AR
observations. SHARP features that scale with AR size are signiﬁcantly
correlated with ﬂare activity. However, similar to total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux (Fig. 3A) and total unsigned current helicity (Fig. 3B),
average TP values of these SHARP features remain approximately
constant before and after ﬂaring and thus characterize ﬂaring AR
populations. The average TP value of absolute net current helicity (and
also sum of net current per polarity) systematically increases by about
two times during the lead up to the ﬂare and decreases subsequently
(Fig. 3C). This implies that free-energy build-up in large-scale ARs,
manifested in ﬁeld measurements in the form of photospheric electric
current, is dominantly responsible for ﬂares (4, 17). The high, distinct
average-TP value of ﬂux in the neighborhood of the magnetic polarity
inversion line (Fig. 3D) is also a striking feature of ﬂaring ARs (15).

and decrease post ﬂare. Sum of ﬂux near polarity inversion line (R-value) (D) also shows a distinct average TP value. For AR non-potential energy (E), average FN value
undergoes a sharp increase ∼ 12 hours before ﬂares. Average TP value of vertical Lorentz force (F) shows continuous pre-ﬂare decrease i.e. increase in downward-directed

electric current (Fig. 2), is not a leading criterion to discriminate
between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs (Fig. 3E). However, average FN
value of non-potential energy shows a sharp increase hours before
ﬂare. Average TP value of Total vertical Lorentz force (Fig. 3F) also
systematically decreases from days before ﬂares.
Development of emerging ﬂaring ARs Our analysis shows that ex-
tensive SHARP features characteristically distinguish ﬂaring and non-
ﬂaring AR populations. Also, values of the extensive features remain
approximately constant days before and after ﬂares. On the contrary,
newly emerged ARs must start with small values of the extensive
SHARP features. Therefore, we are interested in understanding how
emerging ARs transition to ﬂare-productive states prior to the ﬁrst
ﬂare. For emerging ﬂaring ARs, we compile observations in a time
span tr ∈ [−72, 0] hours where tr = t − TF is time with respect
to the ﬁrst-ﬂare event TF and compute recall Y (tr) and TP and FN
population-average values for each m-th SHARP feature X m(tr).
We see that the machine identiﬁcation or recall of newly emerged
ARs steadily improves with time and yields maximum recall value
of ∼ 0.7, 6 hours before ﬁrst ﬂares (Fig. 4A). In comparison, the
false-positive rate for emerging non-ﬂaring ARs is ∼ 0.1 (recall ∼
0.9). For emerging ﬂaring ARs, population-averaged TP value of
absolute net-current helicity (Fig. 4B) shows steady increase, albeit
the errorbars are signiﬁcant. Most notably, the population-averaged
TP value of vertically downward-directed Lorentz force increases
continuously from days before the ﬂare (Fig. 4C). This may be in-
terpreted as evidence of Maxwell-stress build up in the corona above
ﬂaring active regions, which imparts an enhanced downward-directed
Lorentz force on the photosphere. For FNs in the emerging ﬂaring
AR observations, area (Fig. 4D) and mean non-potential energy (Fig.
4E) show marked increase hours before ﬂare.

We have trained an SVM to classify SHARP features derived from
magnetic ﬁelds of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. The SHARP features
used for training (Table 1A) include extensive AR magnetic ﬁeld
features, features that scale with electric current in ARs representing
energy build-up, features that scale with AR non-potential energy, ﬂux
near polarity inversion line and vertical Lorentz force on ARs. The
trained machine classiﬁes ﬂaring AR observations, separated from
ﬂare events > 72 hours, with an average recall of 0.75 and non-ﬂaring
AR observations with an average recall of 0.89. We compare time and
population averaged values of TP (FN) observations from ﬂaring ARs,
separated from ﬂares > 72 hours, and TN (FP) observations from
non-ﬂaring ARs. We ﬁnd that extensive AR quantities are leading
contributors to the machine classiﬁcation followed by AR features that
scale with electric current. Features derived from AR non-potential
energy contribute the least.

A time series of AR magnetic ﬁeld observations in the form of
SHARP features X(t) when fed into the trained SVM results in ma-
chine prediction Y (t). Average machine prediction at instant tr, with
respect to ﬂares, over population of ﬂaring ARs gives instantaneous
recall Y (tr). Y (tr) can be interpreted as time evolving correlation
of SHARP features with ﬂare activity. We ﬁnd that instantaneous
recall is consistently high, > 0.6, for ﬂaring AR observations from
72 hours prior, increasing to a maximum of 0.91, 24 hours before the
ﬂare. The recall remains high post ﬂare, suggesting that the ARs lie
in a ﬂare-productive state days before and after ﬂares.

Since the machine prediction Y (tr) is a measure of correlation
between SHARP features and ﬂare activity, the temporal evolution of
features from accurately classiﬁed ﬂaring AR observations, i.e. the TP

Similarly, the
statistical evolution of inaccurately classiﬁed ﬂaring AR observations,
i.e. the FN population, has trends that the machine fails to capture.
We ﬁnd that average TP value of extensive AR features — such as
area, total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, total unsigned current helicity —
and ﬂux near the polarity inversion line remain constant for days
before and after ﬂares, characterizing ﬂare-productive states for ARs.
Total unsigned current helicity is reported to be one of the most
signiﬁcant factors for ﬂare forecasting using machine learning (24)
and is a leading contributor for the classiﬁcation of ﬂaring and non-
ﬂaring ARs as well. However, we ﬁnd that the key signature of an
imminent ﬂare is the systematic build-up of electric currents over
days as measured by absolute net current helicity and the sum of net
current per polarity. This storage and release of electric current at
the photosphere suggests that the sub-surface ﬁeld associated with
ﬂaring ARs is twisted (1, 32). From case-studies of individual ARs,
electric current is known to accumulate prior to major ﬂares (16, 17).
However, to our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time such clear
trends have been observed for days before and after ﬂares, and over
statistics of large numbers of ARs. We show that newly emerging ARs
gradually transition to ﬂare-productive states prior to their ﬁrst ﬂares.
The Lorentz force was hitherto known to increase signiﬁcantly only
minutes before ﬂares (18). We ﬁnd, most notably in the emerging
ARs before the ﬁrst ﬂares, evidence of elevated Lorentz forces exerted
on the photosphere by magnetic ﬁeld in the overlying corona for days
before ﬂares.

This work demonstrates the importance of testing the machine on
samples from ARs that are not part of training. Such a restriction is
not explicitly imposed in any prior work related to ﬂare forecasting
using ML (e.g. (24, 26, 28)). Here, we show that SHARP features
corresponding to extensive AR quantities (such as total unsigned
ﬂux, area etc.) are leading contributors to the machine classiﬁcation
and that the average values of these SHARP features do not change
appreciably over a timescale of a few days. Machines trained on
observations from a set of ARs, and then tested on observations from
the same ARs (albeit for different ﬂares), is likely to have higher
recall because it has already added to its memory the information it
saw in training, namely a similar set of SHARP features. Hence, for
accurate testing of the machine, it is important that training and test
data do not contain observations from the same ARs.

Class-imbalance between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs implies that
even a false-positive rate of ∼ 0.1 leads to a signiﬁcant number of
non-ﬂaring ARs being classiﬁed as ﬂaring. These FP magnetic ﬁelds
are from large-scale (∼ 200Mm2) non-ﬂaring ARs with high values
of extensive AR features. Moreover, FN magnetic ﬁelds are from
small-scale ARs (∼ 100Mm2). We see that average FN value of
non-potential energy shows a sharp increase hours prior to the ﬂare
(Fig. 3E and Fig. 4E), possibly caused by rapidly emerging ﬂux (Fig.
4D). These pre-ﬂare temporal patterns in small-scale ﬂaring ARs may
be accurately captured by ML algorithms trained explicitly on time
series data (33). Thus, achieving reliable ﬂare forecasting requires
looking beyond extensive AR features, and focusing on signatures of
electric current build-up and rapidly emerging ﬂux.
