We consider many copies of a general mixed-state source ρAR shared between an encoder and
an inaccessible reference system R. We obtain a strong converse bound for the compression of this
source. This immediately implies a strong converse for the blind compression of ensembles of mixed
states since this is a special case of the general mixed-state source ρAR. Moreover, we consider the
visible compression of ensembles of mixed states. For a bipartite state ρAR, we deﬁne a new quantity
Eα,p(A : R)ρ for α ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (1, ∞) as the α-Rényi generalization of the entanglement of puriﬁcation
Ep(A : R)ρ. For α = 1, we deﬁne E1,p(A : R)ρ := Ep(A : R)ρ. We show that for any rate below the
regularization limα→1+ E∞
the ﬁdelity for the visible
compression of ensembles of mixed states exponentially converges to zero. We conclude that if this
regularized quantity is continuous with respect to α, namely, limα→1+ E∞
p (A : R)ρ,
then the strong converse holds for the visible compression of ensembles of mixed states.

INTRODUCTION AND COMPRESSION MODEL

Quantum source compression was pioneered by Schumacher in [1] where he provided two deﬁnitions for
a quantum source: 1. a quantum system together with correlations with a purifying reference system, and
2. an ensemble of pure states. For both models, he showed that the optimal compression rate is equal to
the von Neumann entropy of the quantum system. The compression of an ensemble source is respectively

called visible or blind compression if the identity of the state is known to the encoder or not. For ensemble
of pure states, both blind and visible compression models lead to the same optimal compression rate [1, 2].
Horodecki generalized the ensemble model of Schumacher to mixed states and found a multi-letter optimal
rate considering the visible scheme [3, 4]. Later, Hayashi showed that this optimal rate is equal to the
regularized entanglement of the puriﬁcation of the source [5]. Contrary to ensemble of pure states, the blind
and visible compression of the ensemble of mixed states do not lead to the same compression rate. In the
blind model, the optimal rate is characterized by a single-letter rate formula in terms of a decomposition of
the ensemble, called the Koashi-Imoto decomposition [6, 7].

Recently, a general mixed-state source is considered in [8–10] where a quantum source is deﬁned as a
quantum system together with correlations with a general quantum reference system. It is shown that the
models deﬁned by Schumacher as well as the ensemble of mixed states (blind scheme) are special cases of this
general mixed-state model. The optimal compression rate of this source is characterized by a single-letter
entropic quantity in terms of a decomposition of the source which is a generalization of the Koashi-Imoto
decomposition [11].

Proving the optimality of the compression rates requires establishing converse bounds. In so-called weak
converse proofs, the compression rate is lower bounded in the limit of the error converging to zero. However,
weak converses leave open whether there is a trade-oﬀ between the compression rate and the error, that is if
a smaller compression rate can be achieved at the expense of having a larger error. A strong converse, on the

other hand, states that such a trade-oﬀ does not hold in the asymptotic limit of many copies of the source,
that is for any rate below the optimal rate the error converges to 1. For ensembles of pure states assuming

that the decoder is a unitary, a strong converse was proved in [2]. The assumption of the unitary decoder
was lifted in [12] where a strong converse bound is obtained using trace inequalities. However, despite all
the progress in establishing strong converse bounds in various information-theoretic tasks, which deal with
processing ensembles of pure states or quantum systems with purifying reference systems e.g. [12, 13], it was
an open problem so far whether the strong converse holds for the compression of mixed states.

2

In this paper, we ﬁrst prove a strong converse for compression of a general mixed-state source as deﬁned in
[8–10]. This immediately implies a strong converse for the blind compression of the ensemble of mixed states
since this ensemble source is a special case of the general mixed-state source where the reference system has
a classical structure. To deal with the visible compression case, we deﬁne a new quantity Eα,p(A : R)ρ in
Deﬁnition 7 as an α-Rényi generalization of the entanglement of puriﬁcation and obtain a bound on the
ﬁdelity with respect to the regularization of this quantity i.e. E∞
α,p(A : R)ρ. We conclude that continuity
of E∞
1+ implies that the strong converse holds for the visible
α,p(A : R)ρ = E∞
compression of mixed states. It remains an open question if limα→1+ E∞
p (A : R)ρ holds true.

The organization of the paper is as follows. We introduce some notation and convention at the end of this
section. In Section II we deﬁne the asymptotic compression task which uniﬁes the visible and blind model.
In Section III and Section IV, we address respectively the blind and visible schemes. Finally, we discuss our
results in Section V.

Notation. In this paper, quantum systems are associated with ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces A, R,
etc., whose dimensions are denoted by

abuse the notation and let Q denote both a quantum system and a quantum rate. The von Neumann entropy

II. COMPRESSION MODEL

An ensemble source can be deﬁned as a classical-quantum state where preserving the ﬁdelity with the
classical reference system R is equivalent to preserving the ﬁdelity by taking the average over the states of
the ensemble, as shown in Eq. (1). Therefore, we consider the following classical-quantum state as the source

In this section, we consider a general mixed-state source ρAR, which is not necessarily a classical-quantum
state as in Eq. (2), and prove a strong converse bound for it. This immediately implies a strong converse for

the source deﬁned in Eq. (2).

We consider the same encoding-decoding model as in Section II. The encoder performs the encoding

isometry VC : An ֒

M W to obtain the compressed system M and an environment system W :

The ﬁdelity for this blind scheme is deﬁned as follows:

F b = F (ρAnRn

, ξ ˆAnRn

),

(3)

where ξ ˆAnRn

= Tr V W ξ ˆAnW V Rn

.

As shown in [8–10], the optimal compression rate of a general mixed-state source ρAR is equal to S(CQ)ω,
i.e the von Neumann entropy of the classical and quantum systems in a decomposition of this state introduced
in [11], which is a generalization of the decomposition introduced by Koashi and Imoto in [7]. Namely, for
, there is a unique decomposition of the Hilbert space describing the structure
any set of quantum states
. This idea was generalized in [11] for a general mixed state ρAR
of CPTP maps which preserve the set
describing the structure of CPTP maps acting on system A which preserve the overall state ρAR. This was
achieved by showing that any such map preserves the set of all possible states on system A which can be
obtained by measuring system R, and conversely any map preserving the set of all possible states on system
A obtained by measuring system R, preserves the state ρAR, thus reducing the general case to the case of
classical-quantum states

To prove a strong converse bound, we use the following lemma where the ﬁdelity between two states is
upper bounded by the Rényi entropies of the corresponding states. This lemma, which was initially proved
in [15], was later generalized in [13] to bound the ﬁdelity by conditional Rényi entropies.

In the following theorem, we obtain a bound on the ﬁdelity F b which is with respect to the Rényi entropy.

Below, in Proposition 5 we state the strong converse bound.

V. DISCUSSION

We prove a strong converse bound for the compression of a general mixed-state source ρAR shared between
an encoder and an inaccessible reference system as deﬁned in [8–10]. This implies a strong converse for the

blind compression of ensembles of mixed states since it is a special case of the general mixed-state source
when the reference system R is classical. We apply Lemma 2 to establish an upper bound on the ﬁdelity
between the decoded output systems, including the environment of the decoding isometry, and a speciﬁc
extension of the source with their the Rényi entropy diﬀerences. This implies that if the aforementioned
ﬁdelity is bounded for all such extensions of the source, then the ﬁdelity criterion for the blind compression
of ensembles of mixed states is bounded as well (Lemma 14).

The second part of the paper is dedicated to the visible compression of ensembles of mixed states. We
deﬁne a new quantity in Deﬁnition 7 which is similar to the entanglement of puriﬁcation, however, instead
of von Neumann entropy, the minimization of the Rényi entropy is taken into account. We obtain an upper
bound on the ﬁdelity criterion in terms of the regularization of the α-Rényi entanglement of puriﬁcation
E∞
α,p(A : R)ρ the ﬁdelity exponentially converges to

α,p(A : R)ρ and show that for any rate below limα→1+ E∞

scheme.

α,p(A :

APPENDIX

In Lemma 4, we establish dimension bound on system E which is deﬁned in Eq. (8). A similar system E
is deﬁned in the following lemma which we use to prove Theorem 3. The only diﬀerence is that the following
lemma is based on a one-shot setting. Therefore, we assume that systems E and E′ have dimensions bounded
by
