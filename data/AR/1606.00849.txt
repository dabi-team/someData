Abstract

We present a calculation of the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum, fully including all grav-

itational eﬀects and a possible non-minimal Higgs-curvature coupling ξ, and using the three-loop

Standard Model eﬀective potential. Without a non-minimal coupling, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect of

the gravitational backreaction is small and less signiﬁcant than previous calculations suggested.

The gravitational eﬀects are smallest, and almost completely suppressed, near the conformal value

ξ = 1/6 of the non-minimal coupling. Moving ξ away from this value in either direction universally

suppresses the decay rate.

INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 [1, 2], there has been considerable inter-

est in the phenomenon of vacuum decay, motivated by calculations which suggest that the

Standard Model eﬀective potential is unstable for the observed value of the Higgs boson

and top quark masses [3–5]. The observed masses place the Standard Model ﬁrmly in the

meta-stability zone, i.e., there exists a second minimum of the potential at much larger ﬁeld

values, to which the electroweak vacuum can decay via the nucleation of bubbles of true

vacuum, with the expected life-time of the visible universe longer than its age by many

orders of magnitude [6]. The non-occurrence of such a bubble nucleation event is not incon-

sistent with this long lifetime, however, the possibility of vacuum decay places constraints

on high energy phenomena which might result in the nucleation of true vacuum bubbles.

The implications for inﬂation with a high Hubble rate, for example, have been investigated

by many authors [7–11].

Lately, there has also been renewed interest in the eﬀect of gravitational back-reaction on

vacuum decay in the Standard Model. Calculations show that vacuum decay is dominated

by the formation of bubbles with a scale only a single order of magnitude below the Planck

scale [12], where the eﬀect of gravity might be expected to start appearing. The Standard

Model eﬀective potential in this regime is negative, and thus the space-time at the center

of such a bubble is locally Anti-de-Sitter(AdS), albeit with a sub-Planckian energy density.

It was shown by Coleman and de Luccia [13], using the thin-wall approximation, that a

transition from a zero-energy-density, false vacuum to a negative-energy-density, true vac-

uum leads to a suppression of the decay rate, due to the warped geometry of the nucleated

bubbles. An early paper by Isidori et al.[14] used a perturbative series in the gravitational

coupling to try and estimate the size of this eﬀect. However, it was pointed out recently by

Branchina et al.[15] that the boundary conditions of the perturbative bounce solution are

not satisﬁed to ﬁrst order (see discussion section). Additionally, Gregory and Moss et al., in

three recent papers [16–18], investigated vacuum decay in a black-hole background, ﬁnding

that a black hole can eﬀectively ‘seed’ vacuum decay, in analogy with phase transitions in

condensed matter systems.

Recent papers have investigated gravitational eﬀects using quartic model potentials; these

have the advantage of being easy to compare to the thin-wall results. Branchina et al. [15]

2

found that the suppression eﬀect was much less signiﬁcant, when compared to the thin-wall

approximation, for properly treated thick-wall bubbles. Masoumi, Paban, and Weinberg also

investigated the thin wall approximation [19]; they showed that energy arguments for when

bubbles may form in the presence of gravitational back-reaction can be extended to thick

wall bubbles and also demonstrated that the tunneling rate is not aﬀected by the presence

of a Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term in the action.

Another factor, when gravity is included, is the possible presence of a non-minimal coupling

between the Higgs ﬁeld and space-time curvature. It cannot be consistently omitted as, even

if zero or near zero at present scales, it will run and become non-zero at higher energies.

Therefore it is required for the renormalizability of a scalar ﬁeld in curved space-time [20].

Previously this has been investigated in an inﬂationary back-ground [10]. So far, however,

these results have not been extrapolated to the case of a ﬂat space false vacuum. Fortu-

nately, the eﬀect of non-minimal coupling in the present day, with only a small cosmological

constant, can be approximated by treating the false vacuum as ﬂat space-time.

In this paper we calculate bounce solutions for the Standard Model eﬀective potential, with

a non-minimal coupling term ξφ2R/2 included in the action. We compute the solutions for

the 3-loop Standard Model eﬀective potential by making use of the 3-loop beta functions

(with 2 loop pole-matching) available in the literature [21, 22], with which we construct

an interpolated potential that can be computed quickly at each step in a numerical inte-

gration. We ﬁnd that the eﬀect of back-reaction on the boundary between instability and

meta-stability is small. Furthermore, for a ﬂat space false-vacuum, non-minimal coupling

always suppresses Standard-Model vacuum decay relative to the ﬂat space calculation with-

out back-reaction, regardless of the sign of ξ. We also ﬁnd that the conformal value of the

coupling, i.e., ξ = 1/6 rather than ξ = 0, leads to near cancellation of the back-reaction,

producing a bounce nearly identical to the ﬂat space bounce. The conformal coupling is

found to be a (near) minimum of the decay exponent when ξ is varied, and an exact min-

imum for the λφ4/4 potential. We show that if the running of the Higgs coupling did not

break the conformal symmetry of the λφ4/4 potential then this near-cancellation would be

exact and the resulting bounces would be identical to ﬂat space. Finally, we present a com-

parison of our results with the perturbative method of Ref.

[14]; we ﬁnd that due to the

aforementioned failure of the boundary conditions at ﬁrst order, the perturbative method

over-estimates the size of back-reaction eﬀects.

BOUNCES WITH NON-MINIMAL COUPLING

The decay rate of a metastable vacuum state is given, in the semi-classical approximation,

by the Coleman formula [23]:

Γ = Ae−B,

(1)

where B = S

−

S0 is the diﬀerence in Euclidean action between two solutions of the Euclidean

ﬁeld equations of the theory. S is the action of a so-called bounce solution which interpolates

between the false and true vacua (though does not in general reach the true vacuum), while

S0 is the action of a constant solution sitting at the false vacuum. The pre-factor A is

determined, at the semi-classical level, by a functional determinant and is known in the ﬂat

space case, see [12], but has yet to be computed in a curved background. The Euclidean

action for a scalar (Higgs) ﬁeld non-minimally coupled to gravity is:

where MP = 1/√8πGN is the reduced Planck mass. This modiﬁes the original action con-

sidered by Coleman and de Luccia [13] to include a possible non-minimal coupling between

the scalar ﬁeld and gravity. This is required to be present for the theory to be renormalizable

[10, 20]. A cosmological constant can also be included, but has here been absorbed into the

deﬁnition of the potential V (φ). We neglect boundary terms, which can be dealt with by

adding a Gibbons-Hawking-York term to the action [24], and do not contribute to the decay

rate because the two solutions are identical on the boundary of the Euclidean space-time,

if it has a boundary: see Ref.

[19] for a recent discussion of these boundary terms. The

resulting Euclidean ﬁeld equations are:

solutions dominate the Euclidean action; this has been proven in ﬂat space [25], but we know

of no proof in the curved space case, nor when non-minimal coupling is included. Under

this assumption, there is a co-ordinate system in which the metric takes the form:

ds2 = dχ2 + a2(χ)dΩ2

(5)

where dΩ2

3 is the unit metric on a 3-sphere. The co-ordinate χ is the radial distance from

the origin, while a(χ) is the radius of curvature of a 3-sphere at ﬁxed radius χ. Using this

co-ordinate system and the assumption of O(4) symmetry, the equations of motion take the

Methods section). The boundary conditions for the bounce are imposed so that the action

diﬀerence is ﬁnite, and depend on the asymptotic behavior of a(χ):

•

If there exists χmax > 0 such that a(χmax) = 0, the Euclidean space-time is compact;

The boundary condition a(0) = 0, required to solve Eq.

(7), is imposed in both cases.

The two scenarios are qualitatively diﬀerent; the compact space-time of the ﬁrst gives rise

5

to an eﬀective temperature, and corresponds to a combination of thermal excitation and

tunneling in a de-Sitter-like space-time (see [26] for a discussion). In this paper we focus on

the second case, which is the behavior in the Standard Model if the false vacuum is exactly

ﬂat space-time.

Including the non-minimal coupling, it is possible to simplify the equations by moving to

the Einstein frame via a conformal transformation:

Eq. (14) can be integrated to obtain ˜φ(φ), but the result cannot easily be inverted, ana-

lytically, for arbitrary ξ. This makes Eq. (11) of limited use for numerics, but it can still

reveal qualitative features of the solution which are somewhat more opaque in Eq.

(6).

Making the variable changes Eqs. (12) to (14) transforms Eq. (6) into (11). Furthermore,

the critical values of φ(0) at which the initial (small χ) direction of motion for solutions to

Eq. (6) changes (that is, the false vacuum, barrier peak, and true vacuum of the potential)

are determined not by V (φ) but by:

which is the potential appearing in Eq. (11). That this potential determines the initial

motion for the solution to Eq. (6) can be veriﬁed by forming the Taylor expansion of the

solution for small χ. Note in particular the singularity appearing for ξ > 0 at φ = MP/√ξ.

This is not simply an artifact of the conformal transformation, as it is present in Eq. (8).

Finite action bounce solutions cannot touch higher ﬁeld values than this. Since bounces in

the Standard Model neglecting gravity are controlled by a scale an order of magnitude below

the Planck scale [12], it is reasonable to conclude that: (a) gravitational back-reaction of

the bounce may have an impact, and (b) non-minimal coupling will necessarily distort the

peak of the bounce solution. As is clear from Eq. (15), the eﬀect of non-minimal coupling

is negligible if φ

NUMERICAL METHODS

An important numerical challenge for bounce calculations including gravitational eﬀects

is that the bounce solutions in a dS-like background do not necessarily touch the false

vacuum [26, 27]; this is a property allowed by the compact nature of the Euclidean analogue

of dS-like spaces. As a result, large (and in the ﬂat space limit, inﬁnite) contributions to

the decay exponent B = S[φbounce]

−

S[φfv] do not cancel explicitly between the bounce

and false-vacuum actions (as is the case in the ﬁxed background approximation). Instead

a ‘near cancellation’ must occur numerically, which is diﬃcult to study without very high

precision calculations. Fortunately, transitions from ﬂat false vacua to AdS true vacua do

not suﬀer from this problem as the Euclidean analogues are non-compact and the bounce

solution must touch the false vacuum. It makes sense, therefore, to ignore the small observed

positive cosmological constant and consider transitions from a ﬂat false vacuum to AdS-like

true vacuum.

We use an overshoot/undershoot method to ﬁnd the bounce solution, as originally proposed

by [13]. Note that we solve Eq. (8) rather than Eq. (7) for the numerics in this paper

in order to avoid the square root ambiguity when ˙a passes through zero, which happens in

a de-Sitter background (for example, in a ﬁxed de-Sitter background with Hubble rate H

the solution is a(χ) = sin(Hχ)/H). We treat Eq. (7) as a constraint which imposes the

second boundary condition ( ˙a(0) = +1) required by Eq. (8). This makes no diﬀerence to

the results for transitions from ﬂat false vacua to AdS true vacua since ˙a > 0 everywhere

for such cases, but it is more generally applicable.

To solve the ordinary diﬀerential equations (O.D.E.s), Eqs. (6,8), we made use of the Odeint

library for c++ [28]. This library was chosen because it is highly modular in its design and

can support a range of diﬀerent variable types; in particular it naturally supports several

7

types of variable precision numbers. We used the MPFR implementation of the GNU multi-

precision library [29, 30] as the variable-precision backend The code uses variable-precision

numbers for two reasons: (a) so that it can resolve the vast range of scales (electroweak,

barrier scale, λ minimization scale, and Planck scale) present in the Standard Model with

suﬃcient precision, and (b) so that it can also be used to study back-reaction in a de-Sitter

background. In de-Sitter there is an additional numerical challenge because the boundary

conditions do not require φ to touch the false vacuum; when back-reaction is taken into

account, S0 does not cancel analytically in S

To approximate the Standard Model potential, we use a piecewise polynomial to interpolate

the running of the self-coupling, λ(t(µ)) where t = ln(µ2/M 2). Choosing µ = φ, the Higgs

potential at large scales can be approximated as:

VSM(φ) =

λ(t(φ))φ4

.

(16)

We form an approximation of this potential starting from N +1 discrete points λi = λ(ti), i =

0, 1, 2, . . . , N obtained by solving the beta functions, which are available in the literature

[6, 21, 22], and then ﬁtting N cubic polynomials λn(t), n = 1, 2, . . . , N, each deﬁned only

between tn−1 and tn:

The constants kn are the derivatives (with respect to t = ln(φ2/M 2)) of the polynomial,

at tn. These are chosen to equal the derivatives of λ, dλ/dt = βλ(t), resulting in a C1

continuous piece-wise approximation of λ(t). An alternative choice is to pick kn such that

the piecewise polynomial is C2 continuous; such an approximation is known as a cubic spline

[31]. However, we found that this led to unwanted oscillation eﬀects in the potential. Figure

the beta functions. Using this approximation, it is possible to create a model of the Standard-

Model potential which is arbitrarily close to the true Standard Model potential simply by

taking more initial points to interpolate between. Note that for non-linearly spaced points

ti (e.g., the output of an adaptive O.D.E. solver), selecting the correct polynomial for an

arbitrary input φ may require an interpolative search: since such a search requires on average

O(log(log(N))) steps [32], this is not generally a problematic bottleneck.

RESULTS

Figure 2 illustrates a few example bounce solutions for diﬀerent values of ξ, compared

with the ﬂat space equivalent. Most notable is ξ = 1/6, which is almost (but as the inset plot

shows, not quite) identical the ﬂat space case. The boundary value φ(0) for each bounce is
10−15, much smaller

constrained by the overshoot/undershoot method to a range of width

∼

than the diﬀerence between the initial values for ξ = 0 and ξ = 1/6, while the solutions are
computed with an absolute error tolerance of 10−20 using arbitrary precision variables. This

veriﬁes that the small diﬀerence between the ξ = 1/6 and ξ = 0 solutions is not simply a

numerical artifact. The eﬀects of positive and negative ξ on the bounce are qualitatively

similar.

Figure 3 shows how this aﬀects the decay rate. As with the bounce, the ξ = 1/6 case

is virtually identical to the ﬂat space case, and represents the approximate minimum decay

exponent. For both positive and negative values of ξ away from ξ = 1/6, the decay rate is

artifact, this ﬁgure is generated using 56642 interpolating polynomials for the running of λ,
with the bounce equations solved at an absolute tolerance of 10−20 using arbitrary precision

variables.

We also computed the eﬀect of varying ξ on the boundary between meta-stability and

instability. Lacking a complete analysis of the A coeﬃcient in Eq. (1), which requires a

computation of the functional determinant including graviton loops, we estimate the life-

Figure 5 appears to suggest that the eﬀect of gravitational back-reaction on vacuum decay

is almost negligible when ξ = 0. Even near the instability boundary, the life-time of the

vacuum would not shift signiﬁcantly due to gravitational eﬀects, despite the change in the

shape of the bounce. This appears to support the ﬁndings of [15], who studied the eﬀect

of back-reaction on vacuum instability in a quartic model potential. They found that the

thin-wall approximation over-estimated the eﬀect of back-reaction in suppressing vacuum

decay compared to the true thick wall bubbles and argued that the inclusion of gravitational

back-reaction would not stabilize the potential against decay, even in a strong gravity regime.

The bounces we calculated for the actual Standard Model potential are thick-wall bubbles

and appear to bear this out; the gravitational back-reaction corrections (for ξ = 0) in the

Standard Model potential are indeed small. Figure 6 veriﬁes for ξ = 0 that the gradient

contribution to R is signiﬁcant in the interior of the bubble; R peaks at the positive value

R/M 2

P = 2.213

10−8 when φ(χpeak)

≈

1017 GeV, at which point V < 0. This suggests a

physical explanation for why the thin-wall approximation over-estimates the suppression of

vacuum decay: in the interior of the bubble the thin-wall approximation assumes that the

only contribution to ˙a is from the true vacuum, i.e.,

(22)

This would correspond to R < 0 and so the R > 0 region of Fig. 6 demonstrates that the

approximation has completely broken down. Physically speaking, the back-reaction due to

the energy density in the interior of the bubble suppresses the decay rate because it decreases

the bubble’s volume to surface area ratio compared to ﬂat space (see [13]); this means an

energy-conserving bubble must be larger. As a result, nucleating such a bubble requires

over-coming a greater gradient-barrier and so the decay rate is suppressed. However, the

back-reaction of the bubble walls, which the thin-wall approximation neglects, counter-acts

this eﬀect since for R > 0 the opposite is true; the volume-to-surface-area ratio of the bubble

increases. The net result is that the interior back-reaction wins, but with a much reduced

suppression of the decay rate. This is in addition to the fact that thick-wall bubbles do not

touch the true-vacuum, which also reduces

R

.

Eﬀect of non-minimal coupling

The situation for ξ

= 0 is somewhat diﬀerent. Most notable is the near cancellation

of the back-reaction when ξ = 1/6, for which the bounce closely resembles the ﬂat space

solution (see Fig. 2). Figure 3 demonstrates that ξ = 1/6 is near the minimal value for the

decay exponent; the decay rate is virtually identical to ﬂat space. The reason for this is that

ξ = 1/6 restores a near conformal symmetry to the bounce equations. Consider the situation

where V (φ) = λφ4/4, for constant λ < 0. Such a potential has a conformal symmetry and

for ξ = 1/6 the equations are, therefore, exactly conformal. The Ricci scalar satisﬁes Eq.
(9) and for ξ = 1/6 the ˙φ2(1

6ξ) term vanishes. Additionally, The second and third terms

Thus R = 0 holds everywhere for this exactly conformal situation and the back-reaction

cancels exactly. It is a simple matter to show that the 3 ˙a

space case as well:

This is exactly the ﬂat space bounce equation. Therefore, in the case of ξ = 1/6 an analytic

nated by the scale at which βλ vanishes, βλ is by deﬁnition tiny in the vicinity of the peak;

this is precisely the region when φ is close to the Planck mass and gravitational eﬀects would

matter most. Thus, the bounce for ξ = 1/6 in the Standard Model should have R

0 and

≈

thus be approximately the same as the ﬂat space case. This is precisely what our numerical

results show; the bounce is almost identical to the ﬂat space bounce except for a small

diﬀerence near the peak (see inset Fig. 2), where the slightly broken conformal symmetry

leads to small back-reaction eﬀects.

To compare the level of back-reaction in each case, we plot the Ricci-scalar for the ξ =

0, ξ = 1/6, and ξ = 1/3 cases in Fig. 6. This demonstrates a signiﬁcant suppression of the

back-reaction, quantiﬁed by R. For ξ = 1/6, the back-reaction is not entirely suppressed,

due to the running of λ breaking the conformal symmetry. Away from ξ = 1/6, Fig. 3

shows that B increases in both directions; this indicates that the eﬀect of ξ is always to

suppress vacuum decay, if the false vacuum is ﬂat. As mentioned in the results section, this

eﬀect persists to larger values of

ξ

. The degree of suppression is evident in Fig. 5, which

region). The eﬀect of pure back-reaction (ξ = 0) is also to push back the boundary, although

the eﬀect is small.

It is worth noting that since the 3-sigma bounds on the top quark and Higgs masses

do not place the Standard Model near the instability boundary, the eﬀect of non-minimal

coupling does not qualitatively change the decay behavior of the Higgs ﬁeld, other than

increasing its life-time. In our analysis, the boundary between stability and meta-stability

does not change, because whether or not the electro-weak vacuum is false is determined in

the Einstein frame by Eq. (15). With ξ = 0 the electro-weak vacuum is stable if V (φ) is

cases with Mt = 173.34 GeV, Mh = 125.15 GeV. For ξ = 1/3, R is positive in the interior

nowhere negative, and meta-stable (or unstable) otherwise. Eq. (15) does not aﬀect the

sign of V , nor where it changes sign (the instability scale, φinst), and so the only eﬀect of

ξ is to change (in this case decrease) the actual decay rate, if the vacuum is not stable.

A completely stable vacuum remains stable when non-minimal coupling is included. Note

that this isn’t the case in a non-ﬂat back-ground, i.e., V (φfv)

= 0, since there the criterion

for stability is that V (φ)

There is a caveat to the above, however; the stability/meta-stability boundary can in fact

shift from the estimate based on the sign of the potential, since in the strong gravity limit

it is possible for the gravitational eﬀects of bounces to AdS true vacua to fully quench

vacuum decay. This was investigated recently in Ref.

[19], who found that the quenching

eﬀect present in the thin wall approximation persisted for thick-wall bubbles, and when all

gravitational eﬀects were taken into account. We do not investigate this eﬀect here, but it

can in principle lead to shifts in the stability/meta-stability boundary.

Exact minimum under ξ variation

The form of Fig. 3 appears to suggest a minimum near to ξ = 1/6. Assuming that

B(ξ) and φξ(χ) (the bounce solution with non-minimal coupling ξ) vary smoothly with ξ,
we can construct an analytic expression for B′(ξ). Recall that B = S

Sfv where Sfv is

−

the false vacuum action. Assuming that the false vacuum lies at φ = 0 for all ξ, then Sfv is

independent of ξ because R = 0 for that solution (this would not be the case for a transition

from a de-Sitter false vacuum, however). Consequently, we can write

All the quantities in the integrand can be evaluated from the bounce solution, once it is

found. We conﬁrmed that this prediction for the derivative of B(ξ) agrees with numerical

diﬀerentiation of the data in Fig. 3. Eq. (31), however, yields useful analytic insight into

the shape of Fig. 3. In particular, it reveals that ξ = 1/6 would be the exact minimum

of the potential for a constant λ quartic potential, since Eq.
scalar vanishes everywhere for ξ = 1/6, hence B′(ξ) = 0.

(23) shows that the Ricci

In the Standard Model, the

conformal symmetry of the large scale Higgs potential is broken by the running of λ, which

manifests in the non-vanishing of R (see Fig. 6). Consequently, the minimum shifts to a

value slightly diﬀerent from ξ = 1/6. The near vanishing of R for ξ = 1/6, however, explains

the observation that Fig. 3 has a minimum very close to ξ = 1/6. The exact minimum can

be found by a root ﬁnding algorithm using Eq. (31). For example, if Mh = 125.15 GeV and

Mt = 173.34 GeV the minimum lies at ξmin = 0.16676, a shift of ξmin −

FIG. 7: Left: comparison of the perturbative results of Ref. [14] to our numerical

calculations in the full Standard Model potential, for Mh = 125.15 GeV. The numerical

calculations show only a small shift from the ﬂat space, constant-λ, Lee-Weinberg result,

while the perturbative formula predicts a much stronger suppression. Right: fractional

diﬀerence between the decay exponents on the left and the Lee-Weinberg prediction.

Back-reaction is found to increase the action, but the fractional eﬀect is small, and much

less signiﬁcant than the perturbative series predicts. Note - the numerical calculation of

the ﬂat space action does not exactly match the Lee-Weinberg prediction as it is computed

in the 3-loop quantum corrected potential, rather than the constant λ potential.

authors of Ref. [14] argue that B is independent of φ1, depending only on a1, to ﬁrst order

in κ because the relevant term in the action vanishes when the equations of motion for φ0

are satisﬁed. Nevertheless, our numerical results are in conﬂict with Eq. (39), which over-

estimates the suppressing eﬀect of back-reaction on the decay exponent (in practical terms,

this does not make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the stability bound as the eﬀect is still small).

Our results give a decay exponent which is much closer to the ﬂat space result (see Fig. 7).

CONCLUSION

We have computed the full gravitational eﬀects on bounces in the Standard Model. For

the region of interest, the eﬀect on the stability bounds of pure (ξ = 0) back-reaction is

almost negligible. Our results disagree with those of Ref. [14], which we ﬁnd over-estimates

the size of gravitational eﬀects. Our calculation supports the recent prediction by the authors

of Ref.

[15] that the gravitational back-reaction should not signiﬁcantly suppress vacuum

decay.

Furthermore, we have computed, for what we believe is the ﬁrst time, the eﬀect on the decay

rate of including a non-minimal coupling term in the action. We found that gravitational

eﬀects suppress vacuum decay universally for all values of the non-minimal coupling and push

back the boundary between instability and stability. The eﬀect, however, would not stabilize

the potential completely because it does not change the location of the boundary between

the stable/meta-stable regions of (Mh, Mt) phase space. Our calculations singled out the

conformal value of ξ = 1/6 as being particularly special. For this value of the non-minimal

coupling the eﬀect of back-reaction was found to nearly cancel, with the cancellation failing

to be exact due to the running of the Higgs self coupling, λ(µ), which breaks the conformal

symmetry. ξ = 1/6 is also a near minimum of the decay exponent as a function of ξ. We

showed that in a exactly conformal potential with ξ = 1/6: (a) the back-reaction completely

cancels, (b) the bounce solution is identical to the ﬂat space bounce, and (c) the decay

exponent is minimal under ξ variations. Each of these properties is found to nearly hold in

the full Standard Model potential, as it is ‘nearly’ conformal at large ﬁeld values.

Our results show that minimal-coupling gravitational eﬀects in computing Standard Model

vacuum decay rates are small, and provide a ﬁrst analysis of the impact of non-minimal

coupling. There is still much to be understood about the eﬀect of gravity and non-minimal

coupling on vacuum decay, however. For example, our results do not take account of the

running of ξ, which should be present in a complete description of its eﬀect on vacuum

decay. Nor do we take into account the eﬀect of graviton loops on the running of the

Standard Model couplings. A proper analysis of these issues will require a study of the

quantum corrections to the gravitational bounce in the form of the functional determinant

pre-factor, A, in Eq. (1). Additionally, as mentioned in the discussion, there may be a

shift in the stability/metastability boundary associated with the quenching eﬀect of AdS

21

true vacua[19]. The nature of this eﬀect when non-minmal coupling is included is a natural

direction for further investigation. Finally, the role of non-minimal coupling in non-ﬂat

back-grounds, for example during inﬂation, is also an important avenue for further study

because it is possible for non-minimal coupling to stabilize the Standard Model potential if

V (φfv) > 0 [10]. Such an analysis could therefore provide useful insight into the implications

of vacuum meta-stability for early universe physics.
