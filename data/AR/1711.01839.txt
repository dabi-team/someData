Measuring Stellar Atmospheric Parameters with
ARES+MOOG

S. G. Sousa and D. T. Andreasen

Abstract The technical aspects in the use of an Equivalent Width (EW) method are
described for the derivation of spectroscopic stellar parameters with ARES+MOOG.
While the science description behind this method can be found in many references,
here the goal is to provide a user manual approach for the codes and scripts pre-
sented in for the tutorial. All the required data is available online1.

1 Introduction

Several methods are used for the derivation of stellar spectroscopic parameters.
These can be divided into two main groups. One based on spectral synthesis for
which synthetic spectra are created and compared with the observed spectrum to
ﬁnd the best ﬁt. The second group adopts a line by line analysis strategy, measuring
the strength of observed spectral lines and then estimating abundances and applying
Physics criteria such as the ionization and excitation balance to ﬁnd the best spectro-
scopic stellar parameters for the observations. The description of the physics behind
these methods can be found in many books[1].

A brief work-ﬂow for an EW method can be described as follows: For a high
quality observed stellar spectrum, starting by measuring the strength of several spec-
tral lines (e.g. EWs with ARES). These measurements are then converted into in-
dividual line abundances which are computed (e.g. with MOOG) using stellar at-
mospheric models, normally assuming Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (LTE)

approximation. The model parameters are then adjusted until the individual line
abundances show evidence of the excitation and ionization balance. This step can
be automatized if a proper minimization method is adopted.

The rest of the document will focus on the technical aspects of the codes provided
for this tutorial and how a student can use them to actually derive spectroscopic
stellar parameters. A more speciﬁc description of the ARES+MOOG method can
be found in [5]. The next sections will be based on the codes and test data available
online.

2 Requirements

This tutorial was implemented to be executed on a Linux machine. Note that even
without an access to a Linux machine, today it is very easy to emulate one by using
virtual machines (e.g. VirtualBox). All the instructions provided both in this docu-
ment and in the repository are compatible for Debian/Ubuntu systems, but can be
easily adapted for other Linux ﬂavors.

2.1 Main codes for the tutorial

ARES

ARES is a C code that allows a fast and automatic measurement of EWs of spectral
absorption lines. The ARES code is a submodule in the school codes repository
and therefore easily updated with the root ARES repository2 which contains more
information. For a more detailed description of the code please see the ARES papers
[2, 4]. Note that the latest version of ARES is already able to deal with in-situ
radial velocity correction and automatic parameterization for the continuum level
which makes the spectral analysis easier and consistent. In order to compile ARES
it is required some external libraries (e.g. CFITSIO, GSL, etc.) which can be easily
installed in Linux machines. The compilation of the code is then handled by the
Makeﬁle provided in the repository.

MOOG

MOOG is a code that performs a variety of LTE spectral analysis. The original
code can also be found in its homepage3. The code available in the school codes
repository is an adapted version of MOOG2014 modiﬁed to neglect its (non-free)

plot library dependency. In this tutorial it is only used the silent version of the code
to make abundance computations for our EW method. The compilation of the code
is also handled by the Makeﬁle.

2.2 Spectral test data

Observed Spectrum

The spectra for the analysis should be of good quality, in terms of resolution (R >
30000) and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100). Three HARPS spectra are provided
for the tutorial. These spectra have R ∼ 110000, and S/N > 300. These spectra is
provided in the folder spectra of the repository. These are standard FITS 1D spec-
tra. In order to be compatible with ARES they need to have the standard keywords
CDELTA1 and CRVAL1 and the units of the wavelengths should be Angstrom.
Alternatively ARES can also read ASCII spectra where the format must be two
columns, the ﬁrst with the wavelengths and the second with the ﬂux. In this tutorial
only the standard 1D ﬁts ﬁles are used.

Linelist

The strength of speciﬁc absorption spectral lines should be measured in this anal-
ysis. As in most EW methods, iron lines are mostly used because they strongly
populate the solar-type spectrum and because iron can be used as a proxy for the
stellar metallicity. The linelist provided online (iron lines parameters.dat) compiles
263 Fe I and 36 Fe II lines. These lines were carefully selected [3] and its atomic
data were revised using a solar spectrum as a reference making it possible to use
of a differential analysis [5]. This linelist is used both for ARES and MOOG. For
ARES the important information is only the wavelength of the lines. The format in
this case is to keep the ﬁrst column as wavelength in Angstrom. For the individ-
ual abundance computation MOOG needs the atomic data, the Excitation Potential
(E.P.), and oscillator strengths (log gf), the 2nd and 3rd columns respectively. The
format of this ﬁle should be kept ﬁxed so the scripts work without a problem.

2.3 Script Codes

Input linelist for MOOG

The EW measurements and the atomic data for the linelist require a special for-
mat to be used by MOOG. To facilitate this task it is provided a python script

4

S. G. Sousa and D. T. Andreasen

(make moog lines.py) that reads the atomic data from the linelist and the output
ﬁle from ARES to compile the required formated input ﬁle for MOOG.

Creating a stellar atmospheric model

For the computation of the individual line abundance it is required the use an at-
mospheric stellar model. MARCS models4 are used in this tutorial. For this task it
is provided a script that interpolates a grid of MARCS models for speciﬁc stellar
parameters. The folder interpol models marcs in the repository includes a script for
this task. In order to make it work, it is ﬁrst required to follow the instructions to
download and extract the grid of MARCS models. The use of the script to get a
speciﬁc atmospheric stellar model is straightforward and it will be described later in
this document.

Excitation and Ionization Correlation

To understand how the individual line abundances depend on the stellar atmospheric
parameters and how to ﬁnd the best stellar parameters, it is provided a plotting script
that allows the visualization of the correlations/indicators needed to constrain the
parameters. These include the abundance vs. E.P., abundance vs. Reduced EW., the
information on | < FeI > − < FeII > | and the average [Fe/H] compared with the
model [M/H]. For more details about these indicators see section 5 and [5]. The
python script (running dir/read moog plot.py) allows to plot these correlations as
well as display the information of these indicators as it is presented later in Fig. 1
and 2.

3 Step by Step Tutorial

The criteria to derive good spectroscopic parameters with this method rely on the
model that enforces the excitation and ionization balance for the line abundances.
Therefore the ﬁnal step of this iterative method is when it is found the same abun-
dance for all the lines which will translate in zero slopes for abundance vs. E.P.,
abundance vs. Reduced EW. and < FeI >=< FeII >. How to reach this? The steps
to derive stellar parameters, where the spectrum TestA.ﬁts is used for this example,
are described as follow:

1. Location: To start the process lets ﬁrst deﬁne a reference folder. Let the folder
running dir be our reference in order to run the codes and scripts in this tutorial.
To conﬁrm this, when displaying the spectra available in the repository the result
should be:

4 marcs.astro.uu.se

Measuring Stellar Atmospheric Parameters with ARES+MOOG

running_dir$ ls ../spectra/
TestA.fits

TestB.fits

TestC.fits

2. Measuring EWs: In this folder it is already present the required ARES input
ﬁle (mine.opt) containing the recommended parameters for high quality spectra.
Details for these parameters may be found in [2, 5]. Running ARES will display
plenty of information in the terminal. In the end the output ﬁle (TestA.ares) will
be created as well as a log ﬁle (logARES.txt) containing all the relevant informa-
tion. To run ARES for the TestA.ﬁts spectrum5:

running_dir$ ../ARES/./ARES

3. MOOG input linelist: To create the line list with the EWs in the correct format
it should be provided the ares output ﬁle (TestA.ares) as well as the linelist with
the reference atomic data (ironlines parameters.dat). This can be done with:

running_dir$ .././make_moog_lines.py TestA.ares ../ironlines_p
arameters.dat
Saved in: lines.TestA.ares

4. Loop start: The beginning of the iteration loop is here where it is created a spe-
ciﬁc MARCS model. Starting the loop with parameters that represent an average
dwarf solar type star (Teff: 5500 K, logg: 4.40 dex, [M/H] = 0 dex, vtur = 1.0
km/s), to generate this model (creating the ﬁle out marcs.atm):

running_dir$ ../interpol_models_marcs/./make_model_marcs.bash
5500 4.4 0.0 1.0

5. MOOG: The next iterative step is to compute the individual line abundances as-
suming the stellar atmospheric model. For this step MOOG will use an already
deﬁned input ﬁle (batch.par) and will then create an output ﬁle with the com-
puted line abundances (output.moog). To run MOOG in its silent mode:

running_dir$ ../MOOG2014/./MOOGSILENT

6. Control check: This is the crucial step where it is validated the stellar parameters
for the model. Again, good parameters are found when the same abundance is
derived for all the lines. The slopes should therefore be negligible (all indicators
having values < 0.005 is a good criteria). If signiﬁcant correlations are found in
these indicators, these can be used to adjust the parameters back in step 4. To
check the status of these indicators the plotting python script can be used:

running_dir$ python read_moog_plot.py output.moog

Fig. 1 The result of the ﬁrst iteration of the TestA.ﬁts spectrum.

Figure 1 shows the plots that appear in the last step. The indicators values for this
ﬁrst iteration are far from zero. Therefore it is require to go back to step 4 and
try different parameters. The strategy to minimize this problem and change the
parameters in the correct direction is discussed in the next section.

4 The strategy to ﬁnd the best parameters

In this section it is brieﬂy described the technical strategy to ﬁnd the best model. A
complete description of this strategy is found in [5]. From ﬁgure 1 the four indicators
values provide the necessary hints to reach a better model for the next iteration.

• Slope E.P.: This indicator is the one that strongly depends on the temperature
of the model. Negative values of this slope means that the correct temperature
should be lower. To ﬁx positive values the temperature should increase in the
next iteration. This indicator controls the excitation balance. Given the very high
number of iron lines, the temperature is one of the best constrained parameters
with this method.

• Slope R.W.: This indicator is connected with the microturbulance parameter
which basically controls the abundance determination for the stronger lines
where saturation becomes specially signiﬁcant in the wings of the absorption
lines[1]. For negative slopes the microturbulance should be reduced, while posi-
tive values it means the microturbulance is overestimated.

• <<< FFFeeeIII >>> −−− <<< FFFeeeIIIIII >>>: Since FeII lines are more sensitive to surface gravity
than FeI lines[1], this indicator can be used to control the log g of the model.
For negative values then log g should decrease for the next iteration, while for
positive values log g should be higher.

• [[[FFFEEE///HHH]]] −−− [[[MMM///HHH]]]: More than an indicator, this is actually a logical physical
constraint for the model. Meaning that the input metallicity should output a com-
patible global iron abundance. Here it is assumed that the iron abundance is a
proxy for the stellar metallicity. Therefore if the iron abundance is larger than
the model metallicity (positive indicator) then it should be increased for the next
iteration. If the indicator is negative this means that the metallicity of the model
is overestimated.

These indicators can be used to ﬁnd a better model for the spectrum TestA.ﬁts.
Figure 2 shows one good result for a model with Teff: 5838 K, logg: 4.34 dex,
[M/H] = 0.25, vtur = 1.08 km/s. With this model all the indicators are close to zero
(all < 0.005). These results can still improve, given the clear presence of outliers in
the ﬁgure. In this case most of these outliers are overestimating the iron abundance
(compared with the average). The cause for this may be related with less reliable,
and overestimated, EW measurements for those speciﬁc spectral lines and therefore
removing these outliers will improve the result.

For this tutorial, it is provided in table 4 the identiﬁcation of the stars for each
test spectrum provided. The table also summarizes the stellar parameters which
were derived by using the same method with remotion of outliers. For the spectrum
TestA.ﬁts, which correspond to HD128620 (also known as α Cen A) the results are
quite close to the ones presented in Fig. 2. Note that temperature is within 10 K,
and the metallicity should be slightly lower (by only 0.02 dex) as expected given

that the outliers overestimate the iron abundance. Although here it is not discussed
any error analysis for this method, it is clear from the results that the precision of
the method is quite high, just by considering the very low spread of the parameters
derived without the lines with problematic EW measurements.
