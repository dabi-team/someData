NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. The main
goals of the experiment are to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter and to
study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement.
In order to reach these goals, a study of
hadron production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and proton-nucleus
interactions as a function of collision energy and size of the colliding nuclei. In this talk, the
newest preliminary results on kaon spectra produced in Ar+Sc collisions at three beam momenta
(30A, 40A and 75A) will be shown. The distributions of transverse mass and rapidity will be
compared with results of NA61/SHINE (p+p, Be+Be) and NA49 (Pb+Pb, C+C, Si+Si), as
well as with available world data.

Identiﬁed kaon production in Ar+Sc collisions at SPS energies

Maciej P. Lewicki

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target spectrometer [1] located in CERN’s North Area, utilizing the
SPS proton, ion and hadron beams. Tracking capabilities are provided by four large volume Time
Projection Chambers (TPC), two of which are located in magnetic ﬁelds. The Projectile Spectator
Detector (PSD), a zero degree, modular calorimeter, is used to determine the centrality of the
collisions.

The aim of the experiment is to explore the QCD phase diagram (µB, T ) by a two-dimensional
scan in collision energy and system size. The yields of hadrons produced in the collisions are
studied for indications of the onset of deconﬁnement (kink, horn and step) and the critical point
of the phase transition (hill in event-by-event ﬂuctuations). This paper discusses the analysis of
Ar+Sc collisions, the next step of the system size scan, following the earlier analysis of p+p and
Be+Be reactions. Comparison of obtained kaon spectra gives important insight into the dynamics
of ion collisions in the transition region between reactions of light and heavy nuclei.

2. dE/dx Method

Charged particle identiﬁcation in the NA61/SHINE experiment is based on the measurement
of the ionization energy loss dE/dx in the gas of the TPCs and of the time of ﬂight to f obtained
from the ToF-L and ToF-R walls. In the region of the relativistic rise of the ionization at large
momenta the measurement of dE/dx alone allows particle identiﬁcation. The acceptance region of
this identiﬁcation method can be seen in Fig. 4 for each employed beam momentum.

Time projection chambers provide measurements of energy loss dE/dx of charged particles
in the chamber gas along their trajectories. Simultaneous measurements of dE/dx and plab allow
for distinction between particle species. Here dE/dx is calculated as the truncated mean (smallest
50%) of cluster charges measured along the track trajectory.

The contributions of e+, e−, π +, π −, K+, K−, p, ¯p and d are obtained by ﬁtting the dE/dx dis-
tributions separately for positively and negatively charged particles in bins of laboratory momentum
plab and transverse momentum pT (see Ref. [2] for details). In order to ensure similar particle mul-
tiplicities in each bin, 13 logarithmic bins are chosen in plab in the range 5–100 GeV/c to cover the
full acceptance of the dE/dx method. Furthermore, the data are binned in 20 equal pT intervals in
the range 0–2 GeV/c.

Fits to the dE/dx distributions in these intervals (see examples in Fig. 1) consider ﬁve particle
types (i = π ±, K±, p/ ¯p, e±, d). The signal shape for a given particle type is parametrized as the
sum of asymmetric Gaussians with widths σi,l depending on the particle type i and the number of
points l measured in the TPCs. Simplifying the notation in the ﬁt formulas, the peak position of the
dE/dx distribution for particle type i is denoted as xi . The contribution of a reconstructed particle
track to the ﬁt function reads:

(2.1)

where x is the dE/dx of the particle, nl is the number of tracks with number of points l in the
sample and Ni is the amplitude of the contribution of particles of type i. The second sum is the

weighted average of the line-shapes from the different numbers of measured points (proportional
to track-length) in the sample. The quantity σi,l is written as:

σi,l =

(cid:18) xi

(2.2)

where σ0 is assumed to be common for all particle types and α = 0.625 is a universal constant.

Figure 1: Example distributions of dE/dx and particle yield ﬁts (residuals shown in lower histograms) in a
single bin of the 30A GeV/c data. Fits were performed in 13 logarithmic bins in p ∈ [5, 100] GeV/c and 20
linear bins in pT ∈ [0.0, 2.0] GeV/c.

2.1 Probability method

The probability method (proposed in Ref. [3]) is used to transform particle spectra obtained in
(plab, pT ) bins to spectra in (y, pT ) bins. The ﬁt results allow to calculate the probability Pi that a
measured particle is of the type i = π ±, K±, p, ¯p, e±, d:

Pi (p, pT , dE/dx) =

fi (p, pT , dE/dx)
∑i fi (p, pT , dE/dx)

(2.3)

As an example, Fig. 2 shows the distribution of probabilities Pi for being a π ±, K±, p, ¯p for all
particles from the 75A GeV/c data. The number ni of particles of type i in a given kinematical bin
(y, pT ) can then be calculated:

ni ∈ {π ±,K±,p, ¯p,e±,d} =

where the summation runs over the number of particles m in the bin.

3. Data analysis

3.1 Event selection

The events recorded by the NA61/SHINE spectrometer were selected for a well reconstructed
interaction vertex in the target and the "violence" (≈centrality) of the collisions. Event centrality

classes were determined using the PSD calorimeter, located most downstream on the beam line.
It measures predominantly the energy EF carried by projectile spectators, the non-interacting nu-
cleons of the beam nucleus. The distribution of EF was used to deﬁne and select event classes
corresponding to collision centrality intervals (see Fig. 3).

Figure 3: Event "violence" (≈centrality) selection using the forward energy (EF ) measured by the PSD
calorimeter. Distributions of EF are shown for 19A (left) and 150A GeV/c (right) beam momentum. Orange
shaded areas on the front face diagram of the PSD indicate modules selected for calculation of EF . Choice
of modules is based on correlation studies between EF and track multiplicity measured by the TPCs.

3.2 Corrections and errors

Corrections of the raw data were based on simulation of Ar+Sc interactions using the EPOS-
1.99 [4] (version CRMC 1.5.3.) model and the GEANT-3.2 code for particle transport and detector
simulation (see Ref. [5]). Centrality classes in the model calculations were selected by the number
of forward spectator nucleons.

Results presented in the plots are shown with statistical uncertainties only. These come from
two sources: the experimental data and the simulation-based corrections. The contribution of the
latter is insigniﬁcant (< 0.1%).

Based on the previous analysis of Be+Be [6] and p+p [2, 5] reactions, systematic errors were

estimated at a level of 5%-10%.

4. Transverse Momentum Spectra

Using well measured tracks coming from the primary interaction, double differential yields
per event in bins of momentum and transverse momentum for positively and negatively charged
kaons were obtained using the dE/dx identiﬁcation method. The probability method described in
the previous section was used to convert the identiﬁed particle yields ﬁtted in bins of (plab, pT ) to
spectra in bins (y, pT ) of center-of-mass rapidity and transverse momentum. Fig. 4 shows the dou-
ble differential yields per event
in slices of rapidity y.

The double differential spectra

described in the previous section are integrated with
respect to transverse momentum pT to calculate the one-dimensional distribution dn
dy of rapidity.
The data points are obtained in the acceptance region of the dE/dx particle identiﬁcation method
(forward-rapidity): y ∈ [0.8; 2.0] for 30A and 40A GeV/c beam momenta and a slightly wider range
y ∈ [0.6; 2.0] for 75A GeV/c.

In order to obtain the 4π full phase space mean kaon multiplicity, the dn

dy spectra are interpo-

lated in the mid-rapidity region.

inary Ar+Sc results. Other symbols show for comparison results for T for other systems from NA61/SHINE
and NA49. The extrapolations to mid-rapidity suggest similar values for Ar+Sc and for Pb+Pb.

For this purpose the measured points of the rapidity distributions are reﬂected with respect to

y = 0 and a ﬁt is performed with two symmetrically displaced Gaussian functions (see Fig. 7):

The limited range of the measurements does not allow a ﬁt with unconstrained parameters
(A, y0, σ ). As a signiﬁcant similarity of rapidity distributions from Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisoins
was observed, the shape parameters y0 and σ were ﬁxed to the values obtained for kaon spectra
measurements in Pb+Pb reactions [7, 8].

To account for minor differences of the compared beam momenta (Ar+Sc at 75A and Pb+Pb

at 80A GeV/c) the following scaling of parameters was applied:

σ =

y(beam)
75
y(beam)
80

· σ(PbPb@80), y0 =

y(beam)
75
y(beam)
80

· y0 (PbPb@80)

(5.2)

where y(beam)

p

is the beam rapidity for beam momentum p. Thus the amplitude A is the only
free parameter and is ﬁtted to both the measured and reﬂected parts of the spectra. It is remarkable
how well the shape parameters from Pb+Pb collisions ﬁt the Ar+Sc data (see Fig. 7).

6. Mean Kaon Multiplicities

In order to obtain the mean kaon multiplicities (cid:104)K+(cid:105) and (cid:104)K−(cid:105), the rapidity spectra dn
dy are
integrated by taking the sum of measurements in the acceptance region (forward-rapidity) and the
integral of the ﬁtted function outside the acceptance (mid-rapidity and y > 2.0). Such a calculation
is clearly laden with signiﬁcant uncertainty:

• statistical error (calculated precisely, originating from data and ﬁt procedure)
• uncertainty due to the choice of ﬁt function parameters.

The latter was estimated by varying the shape parameters y0 and σ . Obtained uncertainty
estimates had typical values of (cid:46) 10% and are shown by orange-shaded bars in Figs. 8-11. A better
estimate of systematic uncertainties will be possible in future when complementary measurements
of tof will allow to obtain data points in the mid-rapidity region.

6.1 System size dependence of kaon production

Particle production changes rapidly with collision energy in the vicinity of the onset of decon-
ﬁnement. One observes a clear, qualitative difference between results obtained in p+p collisions
and collisions of heavy nuclei (Pb+Pb or Au+Au). This difference is especially pronounced in the
production of strange hadrons as exempliﬁed by the horn plot shown in Fig. 8.

The ratios of mean multiplicites (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π +(cid:105) , (cid:104)K−(cid:105) / (cid:104)π −(cid:105) and (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)K−(cid:105) measured in cen-
tral Ar+Sc collisions at beam momenta of 30A, 40A and 75A GeV/c are compared in Figs. 9-11
with results from other systems:

• p+p interactions (30, 40, 80 GeV/c) [2]
• central Pb+Pb collisions (30A, 40A, 80A GeV/c) [7, 8]
• semi-central C+C, Si+Si collisions (40A GeV/c) [12]

In the calculation of the (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π +(cid:105) ratio for Ar+Sc collisions an approximation had to be
made. In the absence of a measurement of (cid:104)π +(cid:105) the mean negative pion multiplicity (cid:104)π −(cid:105) [9] was
used instead assuming isospin symmetry: (cid:104)π +(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)π 0(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)π −(cid:105).

The analysis of particle ratios: (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π +(cid:105) , (cid:104)K−(cid:105) / (cid:104)π −(cid:105) and (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)K−(cid:105) reveals a general
trend in particle production properties: measurements obtained for central Ar+Sc interactions lie
between results from p+p interactions and central Pb+Pb collisions:

• The (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π +(cid:105) ratio (see Fig. 9) follows the same trend for each beam momentum, namely
an increase with system size (quantiﬁed by the mean number of wounded nucleons (cid:104)W (cid:105)).

Ar+Sc data points are approaching those of Pb+Pb collisions towards higher energies.
Similar behavior was already observed for the energy dependence of the produced mean
pion multiplicity per wounded nucleon [9, 10].

• The (cid:104)K−(cid:105) / (cid:104)π −(cid:105) ratio (see Fig. 10) for Ar+Sc collisions lies between the values from p+p
and Pb+Pb interactions. There is a noticeable increase of the ratio with increasing collision
energy for all collision systems.

• The (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)K−(cid:105) ratio (see Fig. 11) shows no obvious systematic dependence on the system

size. However, there appears to be a decrease with increasing collision energy.

7. Summary

Preliminary results on charged kaon production were obtained at the CERN SPS in the 5%

most violent Ar+Sc collisions at three beam momenta (30A, 40A, 75A GeV/c).

Rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of identiﬁed K+ and K− were measured in the
forward rapidity region (y ∈ [0.8, 2.0] at 30A, 40A GeV/c and y ∈ [0.6, 2.0] at 75A GeV/c) and
multiplicities in full phase space were estimated.

Transverse momentum spectra indicate a similarity of Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb systems. The
extrapolation of the inverse slope parameter to mid-rapidity approaches the values obtained for
Pb+Pb collisions (Fig. 6).

Close similarity of spectra in Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions was already observed for nega-

tively charged pions obtained with the "h−" method in a larger acceptance region [11].

Rapidity distributions dn

dy were obtained by integration of pT spectra. A ﬁt to dn

dy was performed
in order to interpolate results in the mid-rapidity region. A strong resemblance of the shape of the
distribution was observed for Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb systems. Using the ﬁt results, mean charged
kaon multiplicities in 4π phase space (cid:104)K+(cid:105) and (cid:104)K−(cid:105) were derived.

The system size dependence of charged kaon production was studied by comparing ratios of

mean multiplicites.

The (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π +(cid:105) ratios obtained for Ar+Sc lie between those in p+p and Pb+Pb systems,

approaching the Pb+Pb values at higher energies.

The (cid:104)K−(cid:105) / (cid:104)π −(cid:105) and (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)K−(cid:105) ratios show no clear dependence on system size.
The collision energy dependence is weak in the measured range for all studied particle ratios.
A modest monotonic increase is observed for the (cid:104)K−(cid:105) / (cid:104)π −(cid:105) ratio, as well as a monotonic decrease
for the measurements of (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)K−(cid:105). The ratio of (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π +(cid:105) in Ar+Sc collisions shows no
indications of a horn structure in the studied limited energy range.

More data are required to understand the particle production dynamics in Ar+Sc collisions.
In the near future tof measurements will supplement the presented data in the mid-rapidity

region.

The analysis of Ar+Sc interactions at three additional beam momenta of 13A, 19A and 150A
GeV/c is ongoing and will provide a wider range for the study of the energy dependence. This year
Xe+La collisions were recorded by NA61/SHINE. Future analysis will provide more complete
information concerning the system size dependence and the onset of the signals of deconﬁnement.
