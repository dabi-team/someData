Abstract: The multicaloric effect is defined as the adiabatic temperature change in mul-
tiferroic materials induced by the application of an external electric or magnetic field, and 
it  was  first  proposed  in  2012.  The  multicaloric  effects  in  multiferroics,  as  well  as  other 
similar caloric effects in single-ferroics, have been the focus of much research due to their 
potential commercialization in solid-state refrigeration. In this short communication ar-
ticle  we  examine  the  thermodynamics  of  the  multicaloric  effect  for  solid-state  heating 
applications. A possible thermodynamic multicaloric heating cycle is proposed, and then 
implemented to estimate the solid-state heating effect for a known electrocaloric system. 
This work offers a path to the implementation of caloric and multicaloric effects to effi-
cient  heating systems  and  we offer a  theoretical  estimate  of  the  upper  limit  of  the  tem-
perature change achievable in a multicaloric cooling or heating effect.

1. Introduction 

Solid-state  caloric  effects  [1-6]  manifest  as  a  temperature  change  within  a  given 
physical system in response to adiabatic changes of internal or external variables such as: 
volume, strain, magnetization or polarization. These temperature changes can be either 
heating or cooling, depending on the sequence of the applied excitation, i.e. application 
or removal of the specific control parameter.   

There is in fact a particular interest in the solid-state magnetocaloric or electrocaloric 
cooling  because  they  offer  the  prospect  of  vibration  free,  low  noise,  efficient  and  envi-
ronmentally  friendly  refrigeration,  including  room  temperature  refrigeration  applica-
tions  but  also  ultra-low  cryogenics  [7].  The  ability  to  develop  solid  state  cooling  tech-
nologies  is  also  attractive  for  integrating  cooling  devices  into  electronic  and  mi-
cro-electronic components [8].   

Driven by their huge commercialization potential, the research in solid-state caloric 
effects has accelerated with most of the efforts concentrated on finding suitable materials 
that  display  large  temperature  changes,  leading  to  the  report  of  giant  caloric  effects 
[1,9,10]. The research efforts on discovering huge caloric effects in single–ferroic materi-
als,  have  been  aided  by  parallel  research  in  a  class  of  materials  used  for  caloric  effects 
called  multiferroics  [11].  Multiferroic  materials  display  simultaneously  multiple  ferroic 
order phases. Since each ferroic order phase can facilitate a wide range of applications, it 
is normally  expected  that materials displaying multiple combined order phases,  would 
offer enhanced capabilities leading to an abundance of applications including advanced 
sensors [12-14], memories  [15,16], magnetic  recording readers  [17,18],  transformers  [19]

and  even  energy  harvesting  devices  [20].  Some  of  the  most  promising  applications  of 
multiferroic  materials  have  been  detailed  in  this  review  article  [21],  with  one  of  them 
being  its  application  to  solid-state  caloric  effects.  This  stimulated  the  concept  of  multi-
caloric effect in multiferroics, first proposed theoretically in 2012 [22] and followed by a 
number of other studies revolving around the same concept [23 - 32]. In reference [23] the 
generalized theory  of the  giant caloric  effects  was  introduced,  which  allows one  to  de-
scribe all possible caloric and multicaloric effects including those induced by more exotic 
means  of  excitation  such  as  mechanical  stress  [33,  34].  For  historical  accuracy,  it  is  im-
portant to mention that the term “multicaloric” appeared in the public domain the same 
year, in an earlier article [35]. While Fahler et al. [35] proposed the possibility of an en-
hanced caloric effect via magneto-electric coupling in multiferroics, the theoretical justi-
fication was presented by Vopson [22] a few months later, as also credited by other au-
thors [36].   

The  original  introduction of  the multicaloric effect  in multiferroics  was done  theo-
retically  using  a  thermodynamic  approach.  Assuming  a  multiferroic  solid  containing 
electrically and magnetically ordered phases, the differential Gibbs free energy is: dG = 
–SdT – MdH – PdE, where S is the entropy, M is the magnetization and P the polariza-
tion  of  the  system.  Assuming  that  this  system  displays  a  linear  magneto-electric  effect 
characteristic to multiferroics  and mathematically defined by the   coupling coefficient 
(M/E)T,H =  (P/H)T,E  =  , then  the  electrically  (1)  and magnetically  (2)  induced multi-
caloric effects in a given multiferroic system are expressed as [22]:

where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum, 0 is the dielectric permittivity of 
vacuum, C is the specific heat capacity of the system per unit volume as C = T(S/T)H,E, 
and m and e are the susceptibilities of the magnetic and polar phase, respectively. The 
full derivation of relations (1) is given in references [22,23].   

Equations  (1)  indicate that  a single  excitation  field could  induce  a  full multicaloric 
effect.  If  the  electric  field  is  used  to  induce  the  effect,  then  only  equation  (1.1)  applies, 
while if a magnetic field is driving the caloric process, then only equation (1.2) applies. 
Hence,  a  single  excitation  delivers  a  multiple  caloric  response,  i.e.  multicaloric.  This  is 
very different to ordinary ferroic systems where a single excitation induces a single ca-
loric response.       

Since  M  and  P  of  most  ferroic  and  multiferroic  materials  decrease  with  the  tem-
perature,  i.e.  M/T <  0  and  P/T  <  0,  at  constant  applied  fields,  then  the  multicaloric 
temperature  change  given  by  relations  (1)  can  be  positive  (TE,H  >  0)  for  adiabatic  po-
larization  / magnetization,  or negative  (TE,H  <  0)  for adiabatic depolarization  /  demag-
netization, respectively. A closer examination of relations (1) indicates that they are very 
similar to those describing the electrocaloric and magnetocaloric effects, except that the 
multicaloric effects contain additional terms, (e/( µ0m)(M/T) and (m/(0e)(P/T). 
These  additional  terms  result  from  the  magneto-electric  coupling  in  multiferroics  and 
they can further enhance the thermal effect, especially in strongly coupled multiferroics. 
For  large  multicaloric  coupling  terms  we  expect  a  significant  increase  in  the  total  tem-
perature change. In fact, according to (1), T can increase indefinitely with increasing the 
 coupling coefficient. This, of course, is not possible so the following question arises:   

What is the maximum predicted temperature change in the multicaloric effect?

In  order  to  answer  this  question,  it  is  useful  to  rewrite  equations  (1)  in  a  further 
simplified manner by expressing the derivatives of the magneto-electric induced M and P 
with respect to T as: (M/T) = e(0e)-1 (P/T) and (P/T) = m(µ0m)-1 (M/T). Us-
ing  these  expressions,  we  obtained  the  following simplified relations  of the  electrically 
and magnetically induced multicaloric effects:

where E = Ef – Ei and H = Hf – Hi. Equations (2) show clearly the enhancement of 
the  electrocaloric  and  magnetocaloric  effects  in  the  case  of  multicaloric  effect  in  mul-
tiferroics,  with  the  additional  contribution  to  T  given  by  the  magneto-electric  caloric 
coupling  term  (2/(µ00me)  +  1).  Indeed,  in the particular case  of  a material  that does 
not display any magneto-electric coupling or it is not multiferroic (e = m = 0), equations 
(2) simply describe the electrocaloric and magnetocaloric effects. 

However,  the  magneto-electric  coupling  coefficient  has  a  fundamental  thermody-
namic limit, which is given by the relation 2     (µ00me) [11]. A more recent derivation 
of this limit was given here [37]. This implies that the magneto-electric caloric coupling 
term takes always fractional values, 2/(µ00me)  1. Imposing this condition in equa-
tions (2), an upper limit can be established for the maximum T expected for the electri-
cally or magnetically induced multicaloric effect, which is twice the temperature change 
expected for the equivalent electrocaloric or magnetocaloric effects induced by the same 
excitation  fields,  if  no  magneto-electric  coupling  exists.  This  offers  a  significant  en-
hancement  of  the  temperature  change  in  a  multicaloric  effect  relative  to  single-caloric 
effects.     

The main focus of all previous studies of single-caloric effects in single-ferroic sys-
tems has been the development of solid-state cooling technologies. Similarly, the recently 
proposed multicaloric effect in multiferroics is regarded as the most promising candidate 
for  the development  of  efficient  solid-state  refrigeration  systems  [22,23],  far  superior to 
single-caloric effects.   

In  this  short  communication  article,  we  take  a  different  approach  and,  instead  of 
solid state cooling, we propose the application of the multicaloric effect in multiferroics 
to solid-state heating technologies. The proposed operation principle is explained in fig-
ure 1. For clarity we show the cooling diagram (Fig. 1.a) and thermodynamic cycle (Fig. 
1.b)  (adapted  from  previously  published  work  [22]),  and  the  newly  proposed  heating 
operation principle (Fig. 1.c.d).   

We first explain briefly the multicaloric cooling cycle. The system is initially at the 
operation  temperature  TA.  The system  is  also  assumed  initially  in thermal  equilibrium. 
Since the operation temperature TA is selected so that the cooling agent is in a para-ferroic 
state, then at this state magnetic and electric dipole moments are thermally activated and 
undergo  random  fluctuations  in  a  para-multiferroic  state  (Fig.  1.a).  Imposing  adiabatic 
state, a single excitation field H or E is applied to the multiferroic system. The effect of the 
field application is to align the magnetic and electric dipole moments. This is essentially a 
transition from disorder (high entropy state) to ordered multiferroic (low entropy state) 
(transition A-B, Fig. 1.b). Hence, the decrease in the entropy of the system under adiabatic 
conditions will increase the overall temperature of the system to TB = TA + T. This addi-
tional temperature could be reduced back to the initial temperature via a heat sink. In this 
process,  the  applied  E  or  H  field  is  maintained  constant,  preventing  the  magnetic  and 
electric dipoles from reabsorbing heat. The required operating temperature usually dic-
tates  the  nature  of  the  heat  sink,  and  it  is  usually  a  fluid  coolant  like  water  for  room

temperature operation, or a cryogenic liquid for cryogenic cooling. The transition B-C in 
Fig. 1.b corresponds to the system returning to the initial equilibrium temperature TA of 
the heat sink. Using a thermal switch to break the contact with the heat sink, the system 
returns  to  adiabatic  conditions  and  the  total  entropy  remains  constant  again.  Simulta-
neously,  the applied  H  or  E  field  is  switched  off, corresponding  to  transition C-D,  Fig. 
1.b). The field removal initiates an adiabatic demagnetization and depolarization process, 
causing the magnetic and electric moments to absorb heat as they relax back to equilib-
rium. Since entropy increases again, the adiabatic condition is fulfilled by decreasing the 
temperature of the refrigerant to a value lower than the temperature of the heat sink, i.e. 
TD  =  TA  -  T.  The  transition  D-A  in  Fig.  1.b  corresponds  to  the  multiferroic  refrigerant 
being  placed  in  thermal  contact  with  the  environment  being  refrigerated,  ending  the 
cooling cycle. The  solid-state cooling technology  and  its  thermodynamic cycle  are  well 
established  and  essentially  applied  in  identical  manner  to  all  the  solid-state  caloric  ef-
fects, with the only difference being the caloric material itself and the corresponding ex-
citation force / field.   

Our proposed solid-state heating thermodynamic cycle is very similar to the cooling 

cycle except that it has three stages instead of four (see Figure 1.c, d).

The multicaloric heating cycle begins again with the system at the initial operation 
temperature TA (Fig. 1.c,d). Upon the application of a H or E field, forcing the magnetic 
spins and electric dipole moments to align and reducing the entropy of the system, the 
multiferroic’s temperature increases to TB = TA + T (transition A-B, Fig. 1.c,d). While the 
applied  excitation  field  is  still  on, the  excess  temperature  is transferred to the  environ-
ment via a heat sink. For room temperature heating applications, the heat exchange / sink

is  typically  water  circulated  in  contact  with  the  multiferroic  heating  element.  In  this 
process,  the  system returns  to  the  initial  equilibrium  temperature TA  given by  the  heat 
sink  (transition  B-C,  Fig. 1.c,d).  Maintaining  thermal contact  with  the heat  sink, the ap-
plied H or E field is switched off (transition C-A, Fig. 1.c,d). This is, in effect, an isother-
mal  demagnetization  and  depolarization  process,  which  causes  the  spins  and  electric 
dipoles  to  exchange  heat  with  the  environment,  at  constant  temperature  TA.  The  mul-
tiferroic heating element is then subjected to another field application and the whole cy-
cle is repeated again. 

The  temperature  change  T (increase  for  heating  or  decrease  for  cooling),  is  gov-
erned by  the  set  of multicaloric  effect  equations  (1)  or  (2),  also  applicable  for non mul-
tiferroic materials.   

By  selecting  an  active multiferroic material  displaying  order phase transition tem-
peratures of the magnetic and electric phases at room temperature [38,39] (i.e. Tcm  Tce  
300K), then M/T, P/T and the total entropy change are largest at around 300K. This 
property  combined  with  a  large  enough  magneto-electric  coupling  coefficient,  would 
result  in significant T changes.  In terms  of  room  temperature heating  applications  for 
domestic use, this is interesting as it suggests that a domestic heating system operating 
on the proposed multicaloric heating principle, would only require a temperature change 
of around T = 10K, in order to ensure that it maintains a constant working temperature 
of the environment ideal for habitation. Assuming that active multiferroic elements dis-
playing large magneto-electric coupling effects at room temperature are developed, then 
heating systems operating on this principle would certainly become a reality.   

To  highlight  the  potential  heating  application  we  have  investigated  an  idealized 
heating system comprising the electrocaloric material PbSc0.5Ta0.5 O3 (PST). Using the data 
presented  in Nair  et. al  [40]  we have constructed an  idealized model to  investigate the 
potential  output  heating  power,  electrical  input  power  and  the  resulting  coefficient  of 
performance (CoP) for a system operating between 10 C and 60 C, these being the re-
spective vales for TA and TB of Figure 1.d. As it is typical of currently known electrocaloric 
materials the temperature change on the application of an electric field is low, for PST the 
maximum  is  ~  4  K  at  305  K  with 15.8  Vµm-1  electric  field  [40].  In  order  to  increase  the 
temperature differential between points TA and TB (Figure 1.d) we have considered a 13 
PST multi-layer system. The resulting thermal output power and electrical input power 
are presented in Figure 2 as a function of the speed in which the thermodynamic cycle in 
Figure 1.d can be achieved. The resulting coefficient of performance, i.e. the difference in 
output  power  to  input  power  is  3,  giving  an  efficiency  of  300%.  This  highlights  the 
high efficiency / CoP due to the ability to extract heat from the low temperature end of 
the system in the same way that heat pumps extract heat from their surroundings.

A  cycle  time  (path  A-B-C  in  Figure  1.d)  of  the  order  of  seconds  is  not  unrealistic 
considering  the  sub-minute  magnetocaloric  cycle  times  presented  in  Bartlett  et.  al  [41] 
and the relative ease in which an electric field can be generated compared to a magnetic 
field.  When  the  same  heating  principle  is  applied  to  a  suitable  multiferroic  active  ele-
ment,  up  to  twice  the  temperature  change  is  expected,  leading  to  even  more  efficient 
heating systems. 

The  purpose  of  this  communication  article  is  to  reemphasize  the  fundamentals  of 
solid-state refrigeration based on the new concept of multicaloric effect in multiferroics, 
and to propose a new possible application of this effect to solid state heating, in addition 
to the refrigeration. Theoretically, both heating and cooling offer the promise of achiev-
ing ultra-efficient temperature changes with predicted cooling / heating rates per cycle of 
up  to  double  the  values  achieved  in  electrocaloric  or  magnetocaloric  materials.  We 
therefore  hope  that  this  work  will  stimulate  experimental  and  commercial  interest  in 
developing  not  only  solid  state  cooling  based  on  the  multicaloric  effect,  but  also  solid 
state heating technologies.
