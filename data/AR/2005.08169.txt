Abstract

Let On be the set of all maximal outerplanar graphs of order n. Let ar(On, F ) denote the maximum

positive integer k such that T ∈ On has no rainbow subgraph F under a k-edge-coloring of T . Denote

by Mk a matching of size k. In this paper, we prove that ar(On, Mk) ≤ n + 4k − 9 for n ≥ 3k − 3, which

expressively improves the existing upper bound for ar(On, Mk). We also prove that ar(On, M5) = n + 4

for all n ≥ 15.

1 Introduction

For graphs H and G, the anti-Ramsey number of H in G, denoted ar(G, H), is the maximum number of

colors in an edge-coloring of G containing no rainbow copy of H (i.e., no two edges of H receive the same

colors). The problem of determining anti-Ramsey number of H in Kn dates back to the 1975. Since then, the

study of ar(Kn, H) for some special graph H has attracted a lot of attention. Simultaneously, the problem

was extended to ar(G, H) when replacing Kn by other graph G. Various results on ar(G, H) refer to the

survey. Specially, when H is a matching, the value of ar(G, H) has been studied when G is complete graph,

complete split graph [3], complete bipartite graph, regular bipartite graph [1], hypergraph and so on.

Let H be a graph and G a class of graphs containing at least one graph G such that H ⊆ G. The

anti-Ramsey number of H in G, denoted ar(G, H), is the maximum number of colors in an edge-coloring of

G ∈ G such that G contains no rainbow H as a subgraph. Horˇn´ak et al. began the study of ar(Tn, H), where

Tn is the class of all plane triangulations of order n. They considered the anti-Ramsey numbers of cycles

in Tn, which were improved in [4]. For large n, the authors determined the bounds for the anti-Ramsey

numbers of matchings in Tn. Let On denote the class of all maximal outerplanar graphs of order n. Jin

and Ye [2] investigated the anti-Ramsey numbers of matchings in On. They determined the exact values of

ar(On, Mk) for all 2 ≤ k ≤ 4 and gave the upper and lower bounds for general matchings. We summarize

their results as follows.

Theorem 1.1 ([2]) Let n and k be positive integers. Then

(1) ar(On, M2) = 1 for n ≥ 5, and ar(O4, M2) = 3;

(2) ar(On, M3) = n for n ≥ 7, and ar(O6, M3) = 7;

(3) ar(On, M4) = n + 2 for n ≥ 9, and ar(O8, M4) = 11;

(4) n + 2k − 6 ≤ ar(On, Mk) ≤ n + 14k − 25 for all k ≥ 5 and n ≥ 2k.

In this paper, we ﬁrst improve the existing upper bound for ar(On, Mk).

Theorem 1.2 For all n ≥ 3k − 3 and k ≥ 2, ar(On, Mk) ≤ n + 4k − 9.

Theorem 1.2 expressively improves the upper bound in Theorem 1.1(4). We believe that the lower bound

obtained in Theorem 1.1(4) is the exact value of ar(On, Mk) for large n. This is indeed the case for M5.

Theorem 1.3 For all n ≥ 15, ar(On, M5) = n + 4.

The following famous Tutte-Berge formula will be very helpful in the proof of Theorem 1.3. Let β(G) be

the matching number of G.

Theorem 1.4 Let G be a graph of order n. Then there exists T ⊆ V (G) with |T | ≤ m(G) such that

β(G) =

1
2

(n − o(G − T ) + |T |),

where o(G − T ) is the number of odd components in G − T . Moreover, each odd component of G − T is

factor-critical and each even component of G − T has a perfect matching.

In order to prove our results, we ﬁrst show that the following signiﬁcant result.

Lemma 1.5 Let G be a bipartite outerplanar graph of order n with two parts X and Y and |Y | ≥ |X| ≥ 1.

Then e(G) ≤ n + |X| − 2.

Proof. Let G be given as in the statement. We shall prove that e(G) ≤ n + |X| − 2 by induction on n. It

can be easily checked that the result holds when n = 2. So we assume that n ≥ 3. Since G is an outerplanar

graph, we see that δ(G) ≤ 2. Let v ∈ V (G) with dG(v) = δ(G). Assume that dG(v) ≤ 1. By induction

hypothesis, e(G − v) ≤ n + |X| − 3 and so e(G) = e(G − v) + dG(v) ≤ n + |X| − 2, as desired. So we next

assume that δ(G) = 2. We ﬁrst consider v ∈ X. By induction hypothesis, e(G − v) ≤ n − 1 + |X − v| − 2

and so e(G) = e(G − v) + dG(v) ≤ n + |X| − 2. So we further assume that v ∈ Y . Let NG(v) = {v1, v2}. By

induction hypothesis, e(G − v) ≤ n + |X| − 3. Suppose e(G − v) = n + |X| − 3. Then G − v is a maximal

bipartite outerplanar graph. Hence, the size of each face of G − v except for the outer face is four. Then

G − v contains a K2,2-minor with one part {v1, S}, where G[S] is a connected subgraph containing v2. But

then G has a K2,3-minor, which contradicts to the outerplanarity of G. Thus, e(G − v) ≤ n + |X| − 4 and
(cid:3)

so e(G) = e(G − v) + dG(v) ≤ n + |X| − 2, as desired.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.2

We process it by induction on k. By Theorem 1.1(1-3), the results hold when k ≤ 4. So we next assume

k ≥ 5. Suppose ar(On, Mk) ≥ n + 4k − 8 for some k and n ≥ 3k − 3. Then there must have G ∈ On

such that there is no rainbow subgraph Mk in some edge-colored graph G with at least n + 4k − 8 colors.

By induction hypothesis, G contains a rainbow copy of Mk−1. Let H be a rainbow spanning subgraph

of G containing Mk−1 as a subgraph. Then e(H) ≥ n + 4k − 8. Let M be a matching of size k − 1

with vertex set {v1, v2, . . . , v2(k−1)} and edge set {v2i−1v2i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1}. Let I = V (H) − V (M ).
Let M ′ be a matching of size t consisting of edges e ∈ M such that both ends of e have neighbour in I.
Then for any edge f ∈ M − M ′, at least one end of f has no neighbour in I. Without loss of generality,
we may assume M ′ = {v1v2, v3v4, . . . , v2t−1v2t} and dI (v2i−1) = 0 for any t + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Since
G has no rainbow subgraph Mk, it follows that I is an independent set in H and dI (u) = 1 for any
u ∈ V (M ′). Then eH(V (M ′), I) = 2t. Let S = {v2(t+1), v2(t+2), . . . , v2(k−1)}. By Lemma 1.5, eH (S, I) ≤
2|S| + |I| − 2 = 2(k − 1 − t) + (n − 2(k − 1)) − 2 = n − 2t − 2 because |I| = n − 2(k − 1) ≥ k − 1 ≥ |S|.

Since G is an outerplanar graph, we see e(H[V (M )]) ≤ 2|V (M )| − 3 = 4(k − 1) − 3 = 4k − 7. Thus,
e(H) = e(H[V (M )]) + eH(V (M ′), I) + eH (S, I) ≤ (4k − 7) + 2t + (n − 2t − 2) = n + 4k − 9, a contradiction.
Hence, ar(On, Mk) ≤ n + 4k − 9 for any k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 3k − 3. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.2. (cid:3)

3 Proof of Theorem 1.3.

By Theorem 1.1(4), ar(On, M5) ≥ n + 4. We shall prove that ar(On, M5) ≤ n + 4. Suppose not. Then

there is a G ∈ On satisfying G contains no rainbow M5 under some surjection α : E(G) → [k], where

k ≥ n + 5. We use H to denote a rainbow spanning subgraph of G such that e(H) = k. By Theorem 1.1(3),

H contains M4 as a subgraph. Clearly, β(H) = 4 because G contains no rainbow M5. By Theorem 1.4,

there is a T ⊆ V (H) with t := |T | ≤ β(H) = 4 satisfying p := o(H − T ) = n + t − 8. Let A1, . . . , Ap

denote all odd components of H − T with |Ai| = ai for each i ∈ [p]. We may assume that a1 ≤ · · · ≤ ap.

Let r := max{i : ai = 1}. Let V (Ai) = {ui} for all i ∈ [r] with dH (u1) ≥ · · · ≥ dH (ur). Moreover, let

T := {w1, . . . , wt} when t ≥ 1, and U := {u1, . . . , ur}. Let R denote the set of vertices of all even components
of H −T . We claim t ≥ 1. Suppose t = 0. Then p = n−8. Hence, e(H) = Pp−1
i=r+1 e(Ai)+e(H[V (Ap)∪R]) ≤

3

Pp−1

i=r+1(2|Ai|− 3)+ 2|V (Ap)∪R|− 3 = 2(n− r)− 3(p− r) = 2(n− r)− 3(n− 8 − r) = 24 − (n− r) ≤ 16 < n+ 5

because r ≤ p = n − 8 and n ≥ 15, a contradiction. Thus, t ≥ 1. We shall prove several useful claims.

Claim 1. If H − {x, y} has two edge-disjoint M4, then xy /∈ E(G).

Proof. Suppose not. Let M1 and M2 be two edge-disjoint M4 in H − {x, y}. If α(xy) = α(e) for some

e ∈ M1, then M2 ∪ {xy} is a rainbow M5 in G, a contradiction. Thus, α(xy) 6= α(e) for all e ∈ M1. But
(cid:3)

then M1 ∪ {xy} is a rainbow M5 in G, a contradiction.

Claim 2. Let xy ∈ E(G) and uv ∈ E(H). If H − {x, y, u, v} has two edge-disjoint M3, then α(xy) = α(uv).

Proof. Suppose not. Let M1 and M2 be two edge-disjoint M3 in H − {x, y, u, v}. If α(xy) = α(e) for some

e ∈ M1, then M2 ∪ {xy, uv} is a rainbow M5 in G, a contradiction. Thus, α(xy) 6= α(e) for all e ∈ M1. But
(cid:3)

then M1 ∪ {xy, uv} is a rainbow M5 in G, a contradiction.

Claim 3. R = ∅.

Proof. Suppose not. That is, |R| ≥ 2. Note that |R| ≤ n − p − t = 8 − 2t. Then t ≤ 3. Assume

t = 3. Then |R| = 2 and ai = 1 for each i ≥ 1. By Lemma 1.5, eH (T, U ∪ R) ≤ n + 1. Hence,

n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U ∪ R) + e(H[T ]) + e(H[R]) ≤ (n + 1) + 3 + 1 = n + 5. It follows that H[T ] = K3

and eH (T, U ∪ R) = n + 1, which implies that there exist four vertices x1, x2, x3, x4 ∈ U ∪ R such that

dT (xi) = 2. But then G has a K2,3-minor, a contradiction. Assume next t = 2. Then either |R| = 2 or

|R| = 4. If |R| = 2, then ap = 3 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p − 1]. By Lemma 1.5, eH (T, U ∪ R) ≤ n − 3.

Hence, n + 5 ≤ e(H) = e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) + eH (T, U ∪ R) + e(H[R]) ≤ (2 · 5 − 3) + (n − 3) + 1 = n + 5,

which implies that H[T ∪ V (Ap)] is a maximal outerplanar graph and dT (x) = dT (y) = 2 for some

x, y ∈ U ∪ R. But then G has a K2,3-minor (with one part T and the other part {x, y, V (Ap)}), a

contradiction. Thus,

|R| = 4 and so ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p]. By Lemma 1.5, eH (T, U ) ≤ n − 4.

Then n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ∪ R]) ≤ (n − 4) + (2 · 6 − 3) = n + 5, which implies that

dH (u1) = dH (u2) = 2 and H[T ∪ R] is a maximal outerplanar graph. But then G contains a K2,3-minor

(with one part T and the other part {u1, u2, R}), a contradiction. Thus, t = 1 and so p = n − 7. However,
e(H) = Pp
i=1 |Ai|+|R|)−(p+1) =
(cid:3)

i=1(2(|Ai|+t)−3)+2(|R|+t)−3 = 2(Pp

i=1 e(H[T ∪Ai])+e(H[T ∪R]) = Pp

2(n − 1) − (p + 1) = n + 4, a contradiction.

Claim 4. ap ≤ 3.

Proof. Suppose ap ≥ 5. By Claim 3, t ≤ 2, else p = n + t − 8 ≥ n − 5 and so ap ≤ 3. Assume t = 2. Then

ap = 5 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p−1]. We claim e(H[T ∪V (Ap)]) ≤ 2·7−4. Suppose e(H[T ∪V (Ap)]) = 2·7−3.

That is H[T ∪ V (Ap)] is a maximal outerplanar graph, which yields dH (ui) = 1 for each i ≥ 2. Because

eH(T, U ) = e(H) − e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) ≥ n − 6, we see dH (u1) = 2. Note that H[T ∪ V (Ap) ∪ {u1}] is a

maximal outerplanar graph and contains two edge-disjoint M4. By Claim 1, E(G[U − u1]) = ∅. Thus,

4

eG(ui, V (Ap) ∪ {u1}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 2 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Note that |U | ≥ 8 as n ≥ 15. Then either

dU−u1 (u1) ≥ 3 or dU−u1 (V (Ap)) ≥ 3. But then G has a K2,3-minor (with one part {ui, uj, uk} ⊆ U − u1 and

the other part {T, u1} or {T, V (Ap)}), a contradiction. Thus, e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ 2 · 7 − 4. By Lemma 1.5,

eH(T, U ) ≤ n−5. Then n+5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U )+e(H[T ∪V (Ap)]) ≤ (n−5)+(2·7−4) = n+5, which implies

that e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) = 10, dH (u1) = dH (u2) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for each i ≥ 3. Thus, eH(wi, V (Ap)) = 0

for some i ∈ [2]. Without loss of generality, we may assume eH (w1, V (Ap)) = 0. Then H[V (Ap) ∪ {w2}] is

a maximal outerplanar graph because e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) = 10. Note that H − {ui, uj} for i, j ≥ 3 contains

two edge-disjoint M4. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, u2}]) = ∅. Thus, eG(ui, V (Ap) ∪ {u1, u2}) ≥ 1 for each

i ≥ 3 because δ(G) ≥ 2. We claim dU−{u1,u2}({u1, u2}) ≤ 2. Suppose not. Then u1ui, u2uj ∈ E(G) for some
i, j ≥ 3. Note that H[V (Ap) ∪ {w2}] contains two edge-disjoint M3, say M and M ′. By Claim 2, α(u1ui) =

α(u2w1) and α(u2uj) = α(u1w1). But then G has a rainbow M5 = {u1ui, u2uj} ∪ M , a contradiction. Thus,

dU−{u1,u2}({u1, u2}) ≤ 2. Note that |U | ≥ 8 as n ≥ 15. This implies dU−{u1,u2}(V (Ap)) ≥ 3. But then G has

a K2,3-minor (with one part {x, y, z} ⊆ U − {u1, u2} and the other part {T ∪ {u1}, V (Ap)}), a contradiction.

Thus, t = 1. Then either ap = 5 or ap = 7. Suppose ap = 7. Then ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p − 1].

We see n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U ) + e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ (n − 8) + (2 · 8 − 3) = n + 5, which implies

H[T ∪ V (Ap)] is a maximal outerplanar graph and dH (x) = 1 for each x ∈ U . Note that |U | ≥ 7 as

n ≥ 15 and H[T ∪ V (Ap)] contains two edge-disjoint M4. By Claim 1, E(G[U ]) = ∅. Since δ(G) ≥ 2,

eG(x, V (Ap)) ≥ 1 for each x ∈ U . But then G contains a K2,3-minor (with one part {u1, u2, u3} and the

other part {w1, V (Ap)}), a contradiction. Thus, ap = 5. Then ap−1 = 3 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p − 2].

Hence, n+5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U )+e(H[T ∪V (Ap−1)])+e(H[T ∪V (Ap)]) ≤ (n−9)+(2·4−3)+(2·6−3) = n+5,

which implies H[T ∪ V (Ai)] for any i ∈ {p − 1, p} is a maximal outerplanar graph and dH (x) = 1 for each

x ∈ U . Note that H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)] contains two edge-disjoint M4. By Claim 1, E(G[U ]) = ∅. Since

δ(G) ≥ 2, eG(x, V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)) ≥ 1 for each x ∈ U . Note that |U | ≥ 6 as n ≥ 15. Then dU (V (Ai)) ≥ 3

for some i ∈ {p − 1, p}. But then G has a K2,3-minor (with one part {uj, uk, uℓ} ⊆ U and the other part
(cid:3)

{w1, V (Ai)}), a contradiction.

Now we will continue to complete our proof. We ﬁrst consider t = 1. Then p = n − 7. By Claims 3 and

4, ap = ap−1 = ap−2 = 3 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p − 3]. By Theorem 1.4, Ap = Ap−1 = Ap−2 = K3. Hence,
n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U ) + Pp
p−2(2 · 4 − 3) = n + 5, which implies
H[T ∪ V (Ai)] for each i ≥ p − 2 is a maximal outerplanar graph and dH (x) = 1 for each x ∈ U . Note that

i=p−2 e(H[T ∪ V (Ai)]) ≤ (n − 10) + Pp

|U | ≥ 5 as n ≥ 15 and H[T ∪ V (Ap−2) ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)] contains two edge-disjoint M4. By Claim 1,

E(G[U ]) = ∅. Since δ(G) ≥ 2, eG(x, V (Ap−2) ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)) ≥ 1 for each x ∈ U . Then there exist two

vertices in U , say u1, u2, such that eG(u1, V (Ai)) ≥ 1 and eG(u2, V (Ai)) ≥ 1 for some i ≥ p − 2. Without

loss of generality, we may assume eG(ui, V (Ap)) ≥ 1 for each i ∈ [2]. Let V (Ap) = {v1, v2, v3}. Assume
u1v1, u2v2 ∈ E(G). Note that H[T ∪ V (Ap−2) ∪ V (Ap−1)] contains two edge-disjoint M3, say M and M ′.

By Claim 2, α(u1v1) = α(v2v3) and α(u2v2) = α(v1v3). But then G has a rainbow M5 = {u1v1, u2v2} ∪ M ,

a contradiction.

5

Assume next t = 2. Then p = n − 6. By Claims 3 and 4, ap = ap−1 = 3 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p − 2].

By Theorem 1.4, Ap = Ap−1 = K3. Let V (Ap−1) = {v1, v2, v3} and V (Ap) = {v4, v5, v6}. Note that |U | ≥ 7

as n ≥ 15. We ﬁrst claim dH (u1) = 2. Suppose not. Then n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪

V (Ap)]) ≤ (n − 8) + (2 · 8 − 3) = n + 5, which implies that H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)] is a maximal outerplanar

graph and so contains two edge-disjoint M4. By Claim 1, E(G[U ]) = ∅. Thus, eG(ui, V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)) ≥ 1

for each i ≥ 1 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Hence, either dU (V (Ap−1)) ≥ 3 or dU (V (Ap)) ≥ 3 because |U | ≥ 7. But

then G has a K2,3-minor (with one part {x, y, z} ⊆ U and the other part {T, V (Ap−1)} or {T, V (Ap)}), a

contradiction. Thus, dH (u1) = 2. Then e(H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ 2 · 8 − 4. We next claim dH (u2) = 2.

Suppose not. Then n+5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U )+e(H[T ∪V (Ap−1)∪V (Ap)]) ≤ (n−7)+12 = n+5, which implies

that e(H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)]) = 12. Without loss of generality, assume w1v1, w2v2, w2v4, w2v5 ∈ E(H).

Note that H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 2. By Claim 1, E(G[U − u1]) = ∅.

Thus, eG(ui, V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap) ∪ {u1}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 2 because δ(G) ≥ 2. We claim dU−u1 (V (Ap)) ≤ 1.

Suppose not. Assume uiv4, ujv5 ∈ E(G). Note that H[T ∪ Vp−1 ∪ {u1}] contains two edge-disjoint M3,
say M and M ′. By Claim 2, α(uiv4) = α(v5v6) and α(uj v5) = α(v4v6). But then M ∪ {uiv4, ujv5} is

a rainbow M5, a contradiction, as desired. Then either dU−u1 (V (Ap−1)) ≥ 3 or dU−u1 (u1)) ≥ 3 because

|U | ≥ 7. But then G has a K2,3-minor (with one part {x, y, z} ⊆ U − u1 and the other part {T, V (Ap−1)} or

{T, {u1}}), a contradiction. Thus, dH (u2) = 2. That is dH (ui) ≤ 1 for any i ≥ 3 which means eH(T, U ) ≤

n − 6. Hence, eH(T, V (Ai)) ≤ 2 for each i ∈ {p − 1, p} and so e(H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ 11. Thus,

n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U ) + e(H[T ∪ V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ (n − 6) + 11 = n + 5, which implies that

eH(T, V (Ai)) = 2 for each i ∈ {p − 1, p} and w1w2 ∈ E(H). We claim NT (V (Ap−1)) = NT (V (Ap)).

Suppose not. Then H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for i, j ≥ 1. By Claim 1, E(G[U ]) = ∅.

Thus, eG(ui, V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap)) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 3 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Then dU−{u1,u2}(V (Ai)) ≥ 3

for some i ∈ {p − 1, p} because |U | ≥ 7. Similarly, G has a K2,3-minor, a contradiction. Thus, assume

NT (V (Ap−1)) = NT (V (Ap)) = {w2}. Note that H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 3.

By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, u2}]) = ∅. Thus, eG(ui, V (Ap−1) ∪ V (Ap) ∪ {u1, u2}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 3.

Since H − V (Ai) for any i ∈ {p − 1, p} and H − {u1, u2, w1} contain two edge-disjoint M3, we see that

eG(V (Ai), U − {u1, u2}) ≤ 1 and eG({u1, u2}, U − {u1, u2}) ≤ 2. Hence, |U − {u1, u2}| ≤ 4 and so |U | ≤ 6,

which contradicts to n ≥ 15.

Assume then t = 3. Then p = n − 5. By Claim 3, ap = 3 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p − 1]. By Theorem 1.4,

Ap = K3. Note that |U | ≥ 9 as n ≥ 15. By Lemma 1.5, eH (T, U ) ≤ n − 2. We see eH (T, U ) ≥ n − 4, else

e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ n + 4. Thus, eH(T, U ) ∈ {n − 2, n − 3, n − 4}.

Suppose eH(T, U ) = n−2. Then either dH (u1) = 3 and dH (u2) = dH (u3) = 2 or dH (ui) = 2 for all i ∈ [4].

It implies e(H[T ]) ≤ 2 and eH(T, V (Ap)) ≤ 2. So n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ]) + eH (T, V (Ap)) +

e(Ap) ≤ n + 5, which means e(H[T ]) = 2 and eH(T, V (Ap)) = 2. For some ℓ ∈ {4, 5}, H − {ui, uj} contains

two edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ ℓ. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, . . . , uℓ−1}]) = ∅. Hence, eG(ui, V (Ap) ∪

{u1, . . . , uℓ−1}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ ℓ because δ(G) ≥ 2. It is easy to see dU−{u1,...,uℓ−1}({u1, . . . , uℓ−1}) ≤ 2.

Thus, dU−{u1,...,uℓ−1}(V (Ap)) ≥ 3 because |U | ≥ 9. Obviously, G has a K2,3-minor, a contradiction.

Suppose eH(T, U ) = n − 3. Then either dH (u1) = 3 and dH (u2) = 2 or dH (ui) = 2 for all i ∈ [3]. It

implies e(H[T ]) + eH(T, V (Ap)) ≤ 5 and eH(T, V (Ap)) ≤ 3. Hence, n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ]) +

eH(T, V (Ap)) + e(Ap) ≤ n + 5, which means e(H[T ]) + eH(T, V (Ap)) = 5. We claim dH (ui) = 2 for all

i ∈ [3]. Suppose not. Note that H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 3. By Claim 1,

E(G[U − {u1, u2}]) = ∅. Hence, eG(ui, V (Ap) ∪ {u1, u2}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 3 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Then either

dU−{u1,u2}(ui) ≥ 3 for some i ∈ [2] or dU−{u1,u2}(V (Ap)) ≥ 3 because |U | ≥ 9, which means G has a K2,3-

minor, a contradiction. Thus, dH (ui) = 2 for all i ∈ [3]. Note that H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint

M4 for any i, j ≥ 4. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, u2, u3}]) = ∅. Hence, eG(ui, V (Ap)∪{u1, u2, u3}) ≥ 1 for each

i ≥ 4 because δ(G) ≥ 2. It is easy to see dU−{u1,u2,u3}({u1, u2, u3}) ≤ 3. Thus, dU−{u1,u2,u3}(V (Ap)) ≥ 3

because |U | ≥ 9. Obviously, G has a K2,3-minor, a contradiction.

Suppose eH (T, U ) = n − 4. Then either dH (u1) = 3 or dH (ui) = 2 for all i ∈ [2]. If dH (u1) = 3, then

e(H[T ]) ≤ 2 and eH (T, V (Ap)) ≤ 3. Hence, e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ]) + eH (T, V (Ap)) + e(Ap) ≤ n + 4, a

contradiction. Thus, dH (ui) = 2 for all i ∈ [2]. Then NH(u1) 6= NH(u2), else e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ]) +

eH(T, V (Ap)) + e(Ap) ≤ (n − 4) + 2 + 3 + 3 = n + 4. Let NH(u1) = {w1, w2} and NH (u2) = {w2, w3}. Since

n + 5 ≤ e(H) = eH(T, U ) + e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) ≤ (n − 4) + 9 = n + 5, we see e(H[T ∪ V (Ap)]) is a maximal

outerplanar graph, which means w1x, w3y ∈ E(H) for some x 6= y ∈ V (Ap) and e(H[T ]) ≥ 2. Note that

H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 3. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, u2}]) = ∅. Hence,

eG(ui, V (Ap) ∪ {u1, u2}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 3 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Thus, either dU−{u1,u2}(ui) ≥ 3 for some

i ∈ [2] or dU−{u1,u2}(V (Ap)) ≥ 3 because |U | ≥ 9, which means G has a K2,3-minor, a contradiction.

Finally, assume t = 4. Then p = n − 4, which means |R| = 0 and ai = 1 for each i ∈ [p]. That is

|U | = p = n − 4 ≥ 11 because n ≥ 15. By Lemma 1.5, eH (T, U ) ≤ n + 2. We see eH (T, U ) ≥ n, else

e(H) = eH (T, U ) + e(H[T ]) ≤ n + 4. Thus, eH (T, U ) ∈ {n + 2, n + 1, n}.

Assume eH (T, U ) = n + 2. Then e(H[T ]) = e(H) − eH(T, U ) ≥ 3. We next prove that

(∗) dH (u1) + dH (u2) ≤ 5.

To see why (∗) holds, suppose dH (u1)+dH (u2) ≥ 6. Then either dH (u1) = 4 and dH (u2) = 2 or dH (u1) =

dH (u2) = 3. Hence, dH (u3) = dH (u4) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for each i ≥ 5. Note that H −{ui, uj} contains two

edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 5. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, . . . , u4}]) = ∅. Hence, eG(ui, {u1, . . . , u4}) ≥ 1

for each i ≥ 5 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Note that |U | ≥ 11. Then there exist two adjacent vertices in T ,

say w1, w2, such that dU−{u1,...,u4}({w1, w2}) ≥ 3 and NH (ui) = {w1, w2} for some i ∈ {3, 4}. Assume

u5, u6 ∈ NU−{u1,...,u4}(w1) and u7 ∈ NU−{u1,...,u4}(w2). Then either uiu5 ∈ E(G) or uiu6 ∈ E(G). Note

that both H−{ui, u5} and H−{ui, u6} contain two edge-disjoint M4. But then uiu5 /∈ E(G) and uiu6 /∈ E(G)

by Claim 1, a contradiction. Thus, dH (u1) + dH (u2) ≤ 5. This proves (∗).

Note that dH (u2) ≥ 2. By (∗), either dH (u1) = 3 and dH (u2) = · · · = dH (u5) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for

each i ≥ 6, or dH (u1) = · · · = dH (u6) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for each i ≥ 7. Let NH(u2) = {w1, w2} ⊆ NH (u1),

NH(u3) = NH (u4) = {w3, w4} and NH(u6) ⊆ NH (u5) = {w2, w3}. Note that H − {ui, uj} contains two

edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 5. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, . . . , u4}]) = ∅. Hence, eG(ui, {u1, . . . , u4}) ≥ 1

7

for each i ≥ 7. By Claims 1 and 2, we can easily see that dU−{u1,...,u6}(ui) ≤ 1 for any i ∈ [4]. Hence,

|U − {u1, . . . , u6}| ≤ 4, which contradicts to |U | ≥ 11.

Thus, eH(T, U ) ∈ {n + 1, n}. Then e(H[T ]) ≥ 4. Without loss of generality, H[T ] contains a copy of Cr

with vertices w1, . . . , wr in order. We claim that e(H[T ]) = 4 and dH (u1) ≤ 2. Suppose not. Then either

e(H[T ]) ≥ 5 or dH (u1) ≥ 3. It follows that r = 4 and dH (u1) = · · · = dH (u4) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for

each i ≥ 5 when e(H[T ]) ≥ 5; r = 3 and w4 is adjacent to exactly one vertex of Cr, say w3, dH (u1) = 3,

dH (u2) = dH (u3) = dH (u4) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for each i ≥ 5 when dH (u1) ≥ 3. Let NH (ui) = {wi, wi+1}

for each i ∈ [3] and {w1, w4} ⊆ NH (u4). Note that H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for any

i, j ≥ 5. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, . . . , u4}]) = ∅. Hence, eG(ui, {u1, . . . , u4}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 5 because

δ(G) ≥ 2. Then there exist two adjacent vertices in T , say w1, w2, such that dU−{u1,...,u4}({w1, w2}) ≥ 3

because |U | ≥ 11. By symmetry, let u5w1, u6w2, u7w2 ∈ E(H) and u6u1 ∈ E(G). Note that H − {u1, u6}

contains two edge-disjoint M4. But then u6u1 /∈ E(G) by Claim 1, a contradiction, as claimed. Thus, r = 3

and w4 is adjacent to exactly one vertex of Cr, say w3, dH (u1) = · · · = dH (u5) = 2 and dH (ui) = 1 for each

i ≥ 6. Let NH (u1) = {w1, w3}, NH (ui) = {wi−1, wi} for each 2 ≤ i ≤ 4 and NH (u5) = {w3, w4}. Note

that H − {ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint M4 for any i, j ≥ 6. By Claim 1, E(G[U − {u1, . . . , u5}]) = ∅.

Hence, eG(ui, {u1, . . . , u5}) ≥ 1 for each i ≥ 6 because δ(G) ≥ 2. Then either dU−{u1,...,u5}({w1, w2}) ≥ 3 or

dU−{u1,...,u5}({w3, w4}) ≥ 4 because |U | ≥ 11. Suppose dU−{u1,...,u5}({w1, w2}) ≥ 3. Let u6w1, u7w2, u8wi

and u8u2 ∈ E(G), where i ∈ [2]. Note that H−{u8, u2} contains two edge-disjoint M4. But then u8u2 /∈ E(G)

by Claim 1, a contradiction. Suppose dU−{u1,...,u5}({w3, w4}) ≥ 4. Then there exist two vertices ui, uj such

that {uiu4, uju5} ⊆ E(G), where i 6= j ≥ 6. Note that H − {w4, u4, u5, ui, uj} contains two edge-disjoint
M3, say M and M ′. By Claim 2, α(uiu4) = α(w4u5) and α(uju5) = α(w4u4). But then G has a rainbow
(cid:3)

M5 = M ∪ {uiu4, uju5}, a contradiction.
