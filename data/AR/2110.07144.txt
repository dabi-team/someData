Anti-Ramsey number of disjoint rainbow bases in all matroids

Linyuan Lu ∗

October 15, 2021

Abstract

Consider a matroid M = (E, I) with its elements of the ground set E colored. A rainbow
basis is a maximum independent set in which each element receives a diﬀerent color. The rank of
a subset S of E, denoted by rM (S), is the maximum size of an independent set in S. A ﬂat F is
a maximal set in M with a ﬁxed rank. The anti-Ramsey number of t pairwise disjoint rainbow
bases in M , denoted by ar(M, t), is deﬁned as the maximum number of colors m such that there
exists an m coloring of the ground set E of M which contains no t pairwise disjoint rainbow
bases. We determine ar(M, t) for all matroids of rank at least 2: ar(M, t) = |E| if there exists
a ﬂat F0 with |E| − |F0| < t(rM (E) − rM (F0)); and ar(M, t) = maxF : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2{|F | +
t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)} otherwise. This generalizes Lu-Meier-Wang’s previous result on the
anti-Ramsey number of edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees in any multigraph G.

Introduction

Anti-Ramsey problems have been investigated for various types of structures. For example, take a
multigraph G which is a graph that permits multiple edges between two vertices. Let V (G) and
E(G) denote the vertex set and edge set of G respectively. An edge-colored graph G is called
rainbow if every edge of G receives a diﬀerent color. One type of anti-Ramsey problem asks for
the maximum number of colors AR(Kn, G) in an edge-coloring of Kn containing no rainbow copy
of any graph in a class G. For some earlier results when G consists of a single graph, see the
survey [13]. In particular, Montellano-Baallesteros and Neumann-Lara [24] showed a conjecture of
Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os [11] by computing AR(Kn, Ck). Jiang and West [20] determined the
anti-Ramsey number of the family of trees with m edges. For some more recent results, see for
example [12, 14, 15, 19, 21, 22, 33, 34, 35].

In particular, anti-Ramsey problems have been investigated for rainbow spanning subgraphs.
For example, Hass and Young [16] showed that the anti-Ramsey number for perfect matchings
(when n is even) is
+ 2 for n ≥ 14. For rainbow spanning trees, let ar(Kn, t) be the maximum
number of colors in an edge-coloring of Kn not having t edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees. (In
the literature, the notation r(Kn, t) was often used for anti-Ramsey number. Here we change it to
ar(Kn, t) to avoid the confusion with the rank function r(·).) Bialostocki and Voxman [2] showed
that ar(Kn, 1) =
+ 2
for n ≥ 6. Jahanbekam and West [17] extended the investigations to arbitrary number of edge-
disjoint rainbow spanning trees (along with the anti-Ramsey number of some other edge-disjoint

+ 1 for n ≥ 4. Akbari and Alipour [1] showed that ar(Kn, 2) =

they give the anti-Ramsey number of t edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees in Kn for all values of
n and t.

The authors and Wang [22] showed a general framework that enabled one to determine the
anti-Ramsey number r(G, t) for any host multigraph G and all values of t. Note that we assume
that G is loopless, since otherwise we can always assign each loop a unique distinct color without
aﬀecting the existence of rainbow spanning trees.

Given a graph H and a partition P of the vertex set of H, let cr(P, H) be the set of crossing
edges in H whose end vertices belong to diﬀerent parts in the partition P . Let E(P, H) be the set
of non-crossing edges of H with respect to P , i.e., edges whose two end vertices are contained in
the same part in the partition P . Let |P | denote the number of parts in P . It was shown that

Theorem 2 (Lu-Meier-Wang [22]). For any multigraph G, if there is a partition P0 of vertices of
G satisfying |E(G)| − |E(P0, G)| < t(|P0| − 1), then r(G, t) = |E(G)|. Otherwise,

ar(G, t) = max

{|E(P, G)| + t(|P | − 2)},

where the maximum is taken among all partitions P (with |P | ≥ 3) of the vertex set of G.

The fundamental structure underpinning the ideas involved in many anti-Ramsey type problems,
especially those of spanning substructures, is that of a matroid. In this paper, we generalize the
main result of Lu-Meier-Wang in [22] to the framework of matroids. Given a matroid M = (E, I),
where E is the (colored) ground set and I is the family of independent sets. A rainbow basis is
a maximum independent set in which each element receives a diﬀerent color. The rank of a set
S ⊆ E, written by rM (S), is the maximum size of an independent set in S. A ﬂat F is a maximal
set in M with a ﬁxed rank. The anti-Ramsey number of t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases in M ,
denoted by ar(M, t), is deﬁned as the maximum number of colors m such that there exists an m
coloring of the ground set E of M which contains no t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases. Please see
the detailed deﬁnitions of these terminologies in Section 2. Our main result is

Theorem 3. For any matroid M = (E, I) with rank at least 2, if there is a ﬂat F of M satisfying
|E| − |F | < t(rM (E) − rM (F )), then ar(M, t) = |E|. Otherwise,

ar(M, t) =

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)},

(2)

where the maximum is taken among all ﬂats F of M with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2.

We also include the elementary result in the case where the rank of M is 1. Given a matroid

M deﬁne M0 as all rank 0 elements.

Theorem 4. For any matroid M = (E, I) of rank 1, we have

ar(M, t) =

|E|
|M0| + t − 1

(

if |E| < |M0| + t,
otherwise.

The above result is a straightforward application of the pigeonhole principle.

When rM (E) = 2, rM (F ) = 0 implies F ⊆ M0, while rM (F ) = 1 implies F ⊆ cl(x), the closure
of some rank 1 element x. (See the deﬁnitions in Section 2.) Theorem 3 implies the following
corollary.

Corollary 1. For any matroid M = (E, I) of rank 2, we have

ar(M, t) =

|E|
|M0| + t

(

if |E| < |M0| + 2t or |E| < |cl(x)| + t for some x.
otherwise.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we provide the machinery needed to prove
Theorem 3. We turn to the proof of Theorem 3 in Section 3, and in Section 4 we show Theorem
2 is a direct consequence of Theorem 3 and also deduce the anti-Ramsey number of some nice
matroids.

2 Notation and tools

A matroid M = (E, I) is a set E called a ground set and a collection of subsets I ⊆ 2E called
independent sets satisfying,

(I1) if A ∈ I and A′ ⊆ A then A′ ∈ I, and

(I2) if A ∈ I and B ∈ I with |A| < |B| then there exists a b ∈ B \ A such that A ∪ {b} ∈ I.

Any matroid discussed in this paper will be assumed to have a ﬁnite ground set. Any set which

is not independent is dependent. A minimum dependent set is called a circuit, which satisﬁes

(C1) No circuit is contained in another circuit.

(C2) For any two distinct circuits C1 and C2 and x ∈ C1 ∩ C2, then C1 ∪ C2 \ {x} contains a circuit.

An independent set with maximal size is called a basis, which satisﬁes

(B1) No basis is contained in any other basis.

(B2) If B1 and B2 are distinct bases, then for every x ∈ B1 \ B2, there is y ∈ B2 \ B1 such that

B1 \ {x} ∪ {y} is a basis.

From (B1) and (B2) one can easily derive that any two bases of a matroid have the same size.

This number is called the rank of M . The rank function rM : 2E → N is deﬁned as

rM (S) = max{|I| : I ∈ I and I ⊆ S}.

When M is clear under context, we may omit the subscript and write the rank function as r(·).
The rank function rM (·) satisﬁes

3

(R1) For any set S, 0 ≤ rM (S) ≤ |S|.

(R2) If S ⊆ T , then rM (S) ≤ rM (T ).

(R3) If S, T ⊆ E, then the following semimodular inequality holds:

rM (S) + rM (T ) ≥ rM (S ∪ T ) + rM (S ∩ T ).

(3)

The closure of S is the set cl(S) = {x : r(S ∪ {x}) = r(S)}. It satisﬁes the following properties

(S1) For any set S, S ⊆ cl(S).

(S2) For any set S, cl(cl(S)) = cl(S).

(S3) If S ⊂ T , then cl(S) ⊆ cl(T ).

(S4) If x 6∈ cl(S) but x ∈ cl(S ∪ {y}), then y ∈ cl(S ∪ {x}).

When S = {x}, we write cl(x) instead of cl({x}), for short. A set F is called a ﬂat of M if
cl(F ) = F . The ﬂats of M are the maximal sets for its rank.
We will extensively use these properties in the paper.

It is known that these properties of
circuits, bases, rank, and closure can be used as alternative deﬁnitions of a matroid (see Whitney
[31], Wilson [32], and Oxley[27].)

Given t matroids, {Mi = (Ei, Ii) : i = 1, 2, . . . t}, the union matroid, written by M1 ∨M2∨· · · Mt,
i=1Ei and independent sets I = {I1 ∪ I2 ∪ · · · ∪ It : Ii ∈ I for all i ∈ [t]}. The

rMi(T ∩ Ei)}.

i=1
X

Let M t = M ∨ M ∨ · · · ∨ M be the t-fold union of M . The above can be reformulated as

rM t(E) =

min
F ⊆E,F is a ﬂat

{|E \ F | + t · rM (F )}.

Given two matroids M1 = (E, I1) and M2 = (E, I2) on the same ground set E, the matroid

intersection theorem states that

max
I∈I1∩I2

|I| = min
U ⊆E

{rM1(U ) + rM2(E \ U )}.

The matroid intersection theorem can be derived from the matroid union theorem, and vice versa
(see Edmonds [9]).

The following result is due to Edmonds (see [7]), which gives a useful existence condition for t

pairwise disjoint bases in a matroid:

Theorem 5 (Edmonds [7]). For any matroid M = (E, I), M contains t pairwise disjoint bases if
and only if every ﬂat F of M satisﬁes |E| − |F | ≥ t(rM (E) − rM (F )).

Corollary 2. Let M = (E, I) be a matroid. If there exists a ﬂat F of M such that |E| − |F | <
t(rM (E) − rM (F )), then ar(M, t) = |E|.

Proof. By Theorem 5, M cannot contain t pairwise disjoint bases, and thus no coloring of the
ground set can contain t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases. As such, we can color every element of
the ground set a unique color and so ar(M, t) = |E|.

4

Given a matroid M = (E, I) and a coloring of its ground set, we say a set of bases is color-
disjoint if no color among the bases is used more than once. Given a subset S ⊆ E, we use c(S)
to denote the set of colors which appear in S. When S = {x} for some element x ∈ E, we write
c(x) as a shorthand. We will need the following existence result for t color-disjoint bases due to
Schrijver (see [28] and [23]).

Theorem 6. Let M = (E, I) be a matroid equipped with a coloring of its ground set E. M contains
t color-disjoint bases if and only if every ﬂat F of M satisﬁes

|c(E \ F )| ≥ t(rM (E) − rM (F )).

From this point on, we refer to the condition that every ﬂat F of M satisﬁes |E| − |F | ≥
t(rM (E) − rM (F )) as the t pairwise disjoint bases (tPDB) condition. Furthermore, where there is
no room for confusion, we will not specify that F is a ﬂat. Given a family of t pairwise disjoint
rainbow independent sets F = {I1, I2, · · · It} we say that F has a color-disjoint extension to t
pairwise disjoint rainbow bases if elements can be added to each Ii so that each Ii becomes a basis
Ii and if c is a color in Ii \ I then c does not appear in Ii and any other Ij, i 6= j. The following
lemma generalizes Theorem 6 (since we can set all Ii’s to be the empty set).

Lemma 1. Let M = (E, I) be a matroid with a coloring of E and let F = {I1, I2, · · · It} be
a family of t pairwise disjoint rainbow independent sets. F has a color disjoint extension to t
pairwise disjoint rainbow bases in M if and only if for every ﬂat F of M

The subset E′ inherits the coloring from E.

Let M ′ = M ′

Let T ⊆ U ⊆ E′ be the T and U which achieve the minimum above such that U has the minimum
number of elements. Notice that moving any element from U \ T into E′ \ U either decreases the
minimum above (contradicting the choice of T and U ) or it leaves the above minimum the same
(thus contradicting the minimality of U ). As such, we can assume T = U . It follows that

The last equality holds due to Equations 6 and 7. It follows that F has a color-disjoint extension
to t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases in M .

Lemma 2. If M = (E, I) is a matroid with rank at least 2 satisfying the (tPDB) condition, then

ar(M, t) ≥

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (F )−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)},

where the maximum is taken among all ﬂats F (with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2 of M ).

Proof. We exhibit a coloring of the ground set of M which contains no t pairwise disjoint rainbow
bases. We ﬁrst consider the case when t = 1. When t = 1, we are in the color-disjoint setting
so Theorem 6 applies. Let F be the ﬂat of M which achieves the maximum above. Color F in
unique colors and color the remaining |E \ F | in rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1 colors. Since |c(E \ F )| =
rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1 < rM (E) − rM (F ), F violates Theorem 6 and M contains no rainbow basis.
We now assume t ≥ 2. Let F be any ﬂat of M with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2. Color every element
of F a unique color. This contributes |F | colors. Since M satisﬁes the (tPDB) condition and
rM (E) − rM (F ) ≥ 2, we can color t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1) − 1 elements of E \ F unique colors,
and color the remaining elements of E \ F in a new color cs. This contributes an additional
t(rM (E) − rM (T ) − 1) colors. It remains to show that M contains no t pairwise disjoint rainbow
bases.

Suppose M contains t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases {B1, B2, · · · , Bt}. By restricting M to
the set E \ F , it is clear that each Bi contributes |Bi| − |Bi ∩ F | − 1 elements not in color cs to
E \ F . Since Bi ∩ F is independent in F , |Bi ∩ F | ≤ rM (F ). It follows that

|{e ∈ E \ F : c(e) 6= cs}| ≥

(|Bi| − |Bi ∩ F | − 1)

t

i=1
X

≥ t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1).

But, E \ F has only t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1) − 1 elements which are not in color cs. This is a
contradiction and thus

ar(M, t) ≥

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)}.

7

Now we assume M is a matroid with rank at least two and is equipped with a coloring of E
with maxF : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)} + 1 colors. For a ﬂat F of M , we deﬁne

and

η(F ) := |F | − |c(F )|

ξ(F ) := |c(F ) ∩ c(E \ F )|.

A quick application of the inclusion-exclusion principle shows

|c(E)| − |F | = |c(F ) ∪ c(E \ F )| − |F |

= |c(F )| + |c(E \ F )| − |c(F ) ∩ c(E \ F )| − |F |
= |c(E \ F )| − η(F ) − ξ(F ).

It follows that

|c(E \ F )| = |c(E)| − |F | + η(F ) + ξ(F ).

(8)

Since c(E) ≥ maxF : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)} + 1, we then have the following
corollary:

Corollary 3. Let M = (E, I) be a matroid with a coloring of E with at least maxF : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2{|F |+
t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)} + 1 colors appearing in E. Then for any ﬂat F of M , we have

1. if rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2, then

|c(E \ F )| ≥ t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1) + η(F ) + ξ(F ) + 1;

2. if rM (F ) = rM (E) − 1 and |c(E)| > |F |, then

|c(E \ F )| ≥ η(F ) + ξ(F ) + 1.

(9)

(10)

An important observation is that the ﬂats which satisfy Corollary 3 are not “far” from satisfying

Inequality 4. This observation is the intuition behind the following lemma:

Lemma 3. Let I = {I1, I2, . . . , It} be a set of t pairwise disjoint rainbow independent sets such

any ﬂat satisfying Inequality (9) (when rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2) and Inequality (10) (when rM (F ) =

3 Proof of Theorem 3

Proof of Theorem 3. We ﬁrst handle the case of t = 1. The lower bound is given by Lemma 2. Let
M = (E, I) be a matroid and color E with maxF :rM (F )≤rM (E)−2{|F | + rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1} + 1
colors. When t = 1, color-disjoint bases and disjoint rainbow bases are the same, thus Theorem 6
applies. If F is a ﬂat with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2, then

|c(E \ F )| ≥ |c(E)| − |F |

≥ |F | + rM (E) − rM (F ) − |F |
= rM (E) − rM (E).

As such, the condition of Theorem 6 holds for every ﬂat with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2. If rM (F ) =
rM (E) − 1, then the condition of Theorem 6 reads |c(E \ F )| ≥ rM (E) − rM (F ) = 1. Since
rM (F ) = rM (E) − 1, it follows that F 6= E, and as such there is a color on E \ F . It follows that
every ﬂat satisﬁes Theorem 6 and as such M contains a rainbow basis.

We now assume t ≥ 2. The lower bound is given by Lemma 2. For the sake of contradiction,
|E|) matroid with rank at least 2 that satisﬁes the (tPDB)

let M = (E, I) be a minimal (w.r.t.
condition which is a counter-example to the claim

ar(M, t) ≤

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)},

i.e., there exists a coloring of the elements of E with maxF : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2{|F |+t(rM (E)−rM (F )−
1)} + 1 colors with no t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases. We can assume M contains no rank-0
elements, since coloring all such elements in a unique color does not aﬀect the existence of t pairwise
disjoint rainbow bases. Fix a coloring of the elements of E with the described number of colors.

9

 
 
 
Let E2 be the subset of E which consists of all elements whose color appears more than once in E.
For any element x ∈ E2 deﬁne

cl2(x) = cl(x) ∩ E2 = {y ∈ E2 : rM ({x, y}) = 1} ∪ {x}.

I.e. cl2(x) is the set of elements in E2 which form 2-cycles with x together with x. We make the
following claim:

Claim 1. For every x ∈ E2, |cl2(x)| ≤ t.

Proof. Suppose there exists an x ∈ E2 such that |cl2(x)| ≥ t + 1. Since M contains t pairwise
disjoint bases, there must be at least one y ∈ cl2(x) such that y is in none of these disjoint bases.
Let M \ y be the restriction matroid. Since y is in none of the disjoint bases, M \ y satisﬁes the
(tPDB) condition and furthermore rM \y(E \ y) = rM (E). By the minimality of M and the fact
that the color on y appears elsewhere in M ,

ar(M \ y, t) ≤

max
F : F ⊆E\y, rM \y(F )≤rM \y(E\y)−2

{|F | + t(rM \y(E \ y) − rM \y(F ) − 1)}

F : F ⊆E\y, rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)}

< |c(E)|
= |c(E \ y)|.

As such, M \ y and thus M contains t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases contradicting the choice of
M .

Claim 2. For every ﬂat F of M with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E)−2, we have |E|−|F | ≥ t(rM (E)−rM (F ))+1.

Proof. Suppose there exists a ﬂat F ′ of M with rM (F ′) ≤ rM (E) − 2 and |E| − |F ′| = t(rM (E) −
rM (F ′)). Then,

|c(E)| =

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)} + 1

≥ |F ′| + t(rM (E) − rM (F ′) − 1) + 1
= |F ′| + |E| − |F ′| − t + 1
= |E| − t + 1.

Let F be a ﬂat such that rM (F ) = rM (E) − 1. Since M satisﬁes the (tPDB) condition, we have

|E| − |F | ≥ t(rM (E) − rM (F ))

= t.

It follows that |c(E)| − 1 ≥ |E| − t ≥ |F | and as such |c(E)| > |F |. It follows that any ﬂat of M
satisﬁes one of the inequalities in Corollary 3.

Next we will show that M contains t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases, which contradicts our
assumption of M . By Lemma 1, it suﬃces to construct t pairwise disjoint rainbow independent
sets I1, . . . , It such that any ﬂat F of M satisﬁes Inequality (11) in Lemma 1. We say a color c has
multiplicity k in M if the number of elements with color c in M is k. Let m1 ≥ m2 ≥ . . . ≥ ms ≥ 2
be the multiplicities of all colors c1, c2, . . . , cs respectively that have multiplicity at least two in M .
We have a few cases:

10

Case 1: m1 ≥ t.

In this case, place one element of color c1 in each of the independent sets

I1, . . . , It. We have

|Ii| = t = (t − 1) + |c

Hence by Lemma 3 and then by Theorem 1, M has t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases, contra-
dicting the choice of M .

i=1
X

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Case 2: m1 ≤ t − 1. In this case, we can place one element of color c1 in each of {I1, I2, . . . , Im1}.
Then in a similar fashion, place one element of color c2 in each of Im1+1, . . . , Im1+m2 (with
It+i ≡ Ii). Perform this greedy construction for all colors in E2 (in the order of decreasing
multiplicity) until all elements of E2 have been added to I1, I2, . . . , It or until each Ii receives
two elements.

We claim that there exists a swapping of elements in the Ii’s so that the resulting sets
are all independent. Arrange the Ii so that I1, I2, · · · Ik are 2-cycles and the remaining are
independent. Consider ﬁrst I1 = {x, y}. We claim there is an Ij, j > 1 and a swapping of the
elements so that I1 and Ij are independent and rainbow. Consider any set Ij, 1 < j ≤ k. If
there is no swapping of the elements in I1 and Ij to make both sets independent and rainbow,
then (C2) above implies that all pairs of elements in I1 and Ij are 2-cycles. It follows that
for all 1 < j ≤ k, Ij contributes at least 1 unique element to cl2(x).
Now consider any Ij, k < j ≤ t. If |Ij| = 1 and Ij ∪ {y} is independent, then we are done.
Otherwise Ij ∪ {y}, and thus by (C2), Ij ∪ {x}, are 2-cycles.
It follows that each such Ij
contributes a unique element to cl2(x). If |Ij| = 2 and there is no swapping of elements in I1
and Ij which leaves both sets rainbow and independent, then x combined with some element
of Ij must be a 2-cycle. It follows that for each k < j ≤ t, each Ij contributes at least 1
unique element to cl2(x). Therefore, the I2, · · · , It contribute at least t − 1 unique elements
to cl2(x) and {x} and {y} both contribute one. It follows that |cl2(x)| ≥ t + 1 which is a
contradiction to Claim 1. As such, we can ﬁnd such a swapping. Make the swap and reorder
the Ii’s so that the ﬁrst k′ are 2-cylces and the remaining are independent and then repeat
this argument with the new I1 to ﬁnd a new swapping. Clearly after each swap, the number
of dependent sets decreases by at least one. It follows that we can continue in this way until
all sets are independent.

If all elements of E2 have been added to I1, I2, . . . , It, then we have that the left hand side of
Inequality 4 is in fact equal to |E \ T |. Since M satisﬁes the (tPDB) condition, Inequality 4
holds. Hence by Lemma 1, M contains t pairwise disjoint bases, contradicting the choice of
M . Otherwise, each Ii has exactly two elements. Since there are at most t colors appearing
in the Ii’s, we then have

|Ii| ≥ (t − 1) + c

in which case by Lemma 3 and then by Lemma 1, M contains t pairwise disjoint rainbow
bases, contradicting the choice of M again.

Claim 3. There exists an element e ∈ E2 whose removal maintains that in the restriction matroid
M \ e, each ﬂat F satisﬁes the (tPDB) condition.

11

By Claim 2, every ﬂat F of M with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2 has |E \ F | ≥ t(rM (E) − rM (F )) + 1. It
follows that the removal of any element maintains that every ﬂat with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2 satisﬁes
the (tPDB) condition. As such, the only way M \ e violates the (tPDB) condition is if there exists
a ﬂat of M with rM (F ) = rM (E) − 1 and |E \ F | = t(rM (E) − rM (F )). We claim there can only
be one such ﬂat.

Suppose there are two such “bad” ﬂats F1 and F2. It is well known that the intersection of two

ﬂats is a ﬂat. By Inequality (3), we have

Furthermore,

rM (F1 ∩ F2) ≤ rM (F1) + rM (F2) − rM (F1 ∪ F2)

= (rM (E) − 1) + (rM (E) − 1) − rM (E)
= rM (E) − 2.

|E| − |F1 ∩ F2| ≤ |E| − |F1| + |E| − |F2|

= t(rM (E) − rM (F1)) + t(rM (E) − rM (F2))
= t · 2
≤ t(rM (E) − rM (F1 ∩ F2)).

Since M satisﬁes the (tPDB) condition, and F1 ∩ F2 is a ﬂat satisfying rM (F1 ∩ F2) ≤ rM (E) − 2,
the previous inequality contradicts Claim 2. As such, there can only be one “bad” ﬂat.

Let F0 be the “bad” ﬂat. Now since any ﬂat F with rM (F ) ≤ rM (E) − 2 satisﬁes |E| − |F | ≥

t(rM (E) − rM (F )) + 1, we have

|c(E)| =

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)} + 1

≤ |E| − t.

Let C1 be the colors on E which are used only once. Since |c(E)| < |E|, at least one color must
belong to E2. As such, |C1| ≤ |c(E)| − 1 ≤ |E| − t − 1. It follows that

|E2| = |E| − |C1|

≥ |E| − (|E| − t − 1)
= t + 1.

Since |E| − |F0| = t(rM (E) − rM (F0)) = t, and |E2| ≥ t + 1, there exists an element e ∈ E2 ∩ F0.
This element satisﬁes the claim. As such, the claim is proven.

Let e ∈ E2 be the element granted by Claim 3 and remove e from M . Let M \ e = (E \ e, I ′) be
the resulting matroid. Notice that since M has t pairwise disjoint bases, deleting an element can
only destroy one of them. It follows that rM \e(E \ e) = rM (E). Now by the minimality of M ,

ar(M \ e, t) ≤

max
F : rM \e(F )≤rM \e(E)−2

{|F | + t(rM \e(E) − rM \e(F ) − 1)}

≤

max
F : rM (F )≤rM (E)−2

< |c(E \ e)|.

{|F | + t(rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1)}

As such, M \ e contains t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases. Since rM \e(E \ e) = rM (E), it follows
that these t pairwise disjoint rainbow bases are indeed bases for M . This contradicts the choice of
M and completes the proof of Theorem 3.

4 Applications to Various Matroids

In this section, we derive Theorem 2 in [22] using Theorem 3 and apply Theorem 3 to some matroids.

4.1 Graphical Matroid

Let G = (V (G), E(G)) be a multigraph and let M = (E(G), I) be the matroid whose independent
sets are the forests of G. A basis for M is then a spanning tree of G. Let P be a partition of the
vertex set of G. Adding any edge of G into a partition must decrease the number of parts and
thus increase the rank of the non-crossing edges. This justiﬁes that the ﬂats of M correspond to
a partition of the vertex set of G and that the edges within the parts correspond exactly to the
elements in F . The rank rM (F ) of the ﬂat is the sum of the ranks of the parts of P so that

rM (F ) = |V (G)| − |P |

= rM (E) − |P | + 1.

The previous line implies |P | − 2 = rM (E) − rM (F ) − 1. Theorem 3 then reads exactly as

Theorem 7. For any multigraph G, if there is a partition P0 of vertices of G satisfying |E(G)| −
|E(P0, G)| < t(|P0| − 1), then ar(G, t) = |E(G)|. Otherwise,

ar(G, t) = max

{|E(P, G)| + t(|P | − 2)},

P : |P |≥3

(13)

where the maximum is taken among all partitions P (with |P | ≥ 3) of the vertex set of G.

The above is exactly the main result of [22].

4.2 Bi-circular Matroids

Let G = (V (G), E(G)) be a connected multigraph with at least one cycle. One can deﬁne the bi-
circular matroid Mbc(G) = (E(G), I) as the matroid whose independent sets are pseudoforests, that
is a subgraph of G in which every connected component has at most one cycle. We call a subgraph
of G unicyclic if every connected component has exactly one cycle. We deﬁne the anti-Ramsey
number of t edge disjoint rainbow unicyclic graphs as the maximum number of colors arbc(G, t)
such that there exists a coloring of the edges of G with arbc(G, t) colors that contains no t edge
disjoint rainbow unicyclic subgraphs.

In the bi-circular matroid, bases are unicyclic subgraphs while ﬂats are subgraphs of G whose
connected components are either an induced graph of G or a tree. The rank of a subgraph F is
|V (G)| − τ (F ) where τ (F ) be the number of tree components in F . In particular, r(Mbc(G)) =
|V (G)|. Theorem 3 can be rephrased under this context as follows.

Theorem 8. For any multigraph G at least one cycle and at least two vertices, if there is a subgraph
F0 of G satisfying |E(G)| − |E(F0)| < t · τ (F0), then arbc(G, t) = |E(G)|. Otherwise,

arbc(G, t) = max

{|E(F )| + t(τ (F ) − 1)},

F : τ (F )≥2

(14)

where the maximum is taken among all subgraphs F (with τ (F ) ≥ 2) of G.

Now we consider the complete graph Kn. The ﬂats of Kn are subgraphs whose components are
either a clique or a tree. To apply Theorem 8, we need to maximize |F | + t · τ (F ). Among all F

13

with ﬁxed τ (F ) = x, |F | + t · τ (F ) is maximized when F = Kn−x plus x isolated vertices. Consider
+ tx. It is clear that the degenerate case of Theorem 3 now reads that
the function f (x) =
. Since f (x) is concave up, the maximum occurs

either when x = 0 or x = n. Notice that f (0) =

which is never satisﬁed. Since f (n) = tn, after some simpliﬁcation, the degenerate

condition reads that if n < 2t + 1, then arbc(Kn, t) =

4.3 Cographic Matroids



(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Given a connected multigraph G, a cut is a collection of edges C so that deleting C disconnects G.
A bond is a minimal cut of G. The anti-Ramsey number of t edge disjoint rainbow bonds arb(G, t)
asks for the maximal number of colors one can put on the edges of G with no t edge disjoint rainbow
bonds of size |E(G)| − |V (G)| + 1.

A cographic matroid, denoted by M ∗(G), is a matroid with the ground set E(G) such that the
circuits are the bonds of G. All bases have the form E \ T , where T is a spanning tree of G. In
other words, the cographic matroids are the dual of the graphic matroids. In particular, when G is
a planar graph, the cographic matroid M ∗(G) is the same as the graphical matroid M (G∗). Here
G∗ is the dual graph of the planar graph G.

The rank of M ∗(G) is |E(G)| − |V (G)| + 1. The rank of any subset S ⊆ M ∗ is

rM ∗(S) = rM (E \ S) + |S| − rM (E)

= |V (G)| − q(E \ S) + |S| − |V (G)| + 1
= |S| − q(E \ S) + 1,

where q(S) is the number of components in S. A subset F ⊆ E is a ﬂat of M ∗ if and only if E \ F is
a union of cycles. Theorem 3 then reads that if there is a ﬂat F with |E|−|F | < (rM ∗(E)−rM ∗ (F )),
then arb(G, t) = |E| and otherwise,

arb(G, t) =

max
F ⊆E : rM ∗ (F )≤rM ∗ (E)−2

{|F | − t(rM ∗(E) − rM ∗(F ) − 1)}.

4.4 Signed Graphs

A signed graph G = (V (G), E(G)) is a multigraph were each edge is assigned a positive or negative
sign. A subgraph of G is called positive, or negative, if the product of the signs on its edges is

14

positive, or negative respectively. Suppose G is connected and contains at least one negative cycle.
A subset of edges is called balanced if each cycle is positive. We call a subgraph of G in which each
component has exactly one negative cycle a signed unicyclic subgraph. We deﬁne the anti-Ramsey
number of t edge disjoint rainbow signed unicyclic subgraphs, denoted ar±(G, t), as the maximum
number of colors one can put on the edges of G such that G contains no t edge-disjoint rainbow
signed unicyclic subgraphs.

One can deﬁne the signed graphical matroid M = (E, I) where E are the edges of G and a
set of edges are independent if and only if each component contains no cycles or exactly one cycle
which is negative. For a subgraph H of G, let b(H) be the number of balanced components of H.
The rank of a subset S ⊆ E satsiﬁes rM (S) = |V (G)| − b(S). In particular, rM (E) = |V (G)|.

Theorem 3 then reads

Theorem 10. Let G = (V (G), E(G)) be a connected signed graph with at least 2 vertices, at least
one negative cycle, and t ≥ 1 a positive integer. If there exists a subgraph F0 with |E(G)|−|E(F0)| <
t · b(F0), then ar±(G, t) = |E(G)|. Otherwise,

ar±(G, t) = max

F : b(F )≥2

{|E(F )| + t(b(F ) − 1)}

where the maximum is taken over all subgraphs F with b(F ) ≥ 2.

We consider the special case where G = ±Kn the complete signed graph on n vertices. I.e.,
±Kn is the graph where each possible +1 or -1 edge exists between every pair of vertices and there
are no loops.

We turn to maximizing |E(F )| + t · b(F ). It is known that a signed graph is balanced if and
only if it partitions into a pair of subgraphs, one of which is allowed to be empty, all edges within
the parts are positive, and have negative edges connecting the parts [6]. It follows that if F is a
ﬂat of rank n − b(F ), each of the b(F ) balanced components partition into two complete positive
subgraphs and all negative edges exist between. It follows that if B is a balanced component of F ,
. The remaining parts are induced subgraphs of ±Kn which can be combined into
|E(B)| =
one large induced subgraph of ±Kn. Let {B1, B2, · · · , Bb(F )} be the balanced components of F . It

4.5 Transversal Matroids



(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Transversal matroids were ﬁrst studied by Edmonds and Fulkson [10] in 1965. Given a set family
A = {Aj : j ∈ J}, let E = ∪j∈J Aj be the ground set. A partial transversal of A is a subset T of E
such that there is an injective map φ : T → J with t ∈ Aφ(t) for all t ∈ T . When |T | = |J|, partial
transversals are called transversals.

The transversal matroid, denoted by M [A] is a matroid consisting of the ground set E and
all partial transversals as independent sets. Assume transversals of A exist, then bases are just
transversals.

From the set family A = {Aj : j ∈ J}, one can construct a bipartite incidence graph G with
bipartite vertex sets J ∪E, where (j, x) is an edge of G if and only if x ∈ Aj. The partial transverals
are simply the second ends of matchings in G. For any S ⊆ E, the rank rM (S) is simply the
maximum size of matchings in the induced subgraph G[J ∪ S]. Let artr(A, t) be the maximum
number m such that there exists a coloring of E using m colors so that no t disjoint rainbow
transversals exist. Then, Theorem 3 reads that if there exists a ﬂat F with |E| − |F | < t(rM (E) −
rM (F )) then artr(A, t) = |E|; else artr(A, t) = maxF : r(F )≤r(E)−2{|F | + t(r(E) − r(F ) − 1)}.

For any positive integer n, k, the uniform matroid Uk,n is a special transversal matroid with
E = [n] and A = (E, E, · · · , E) repeated k times. Equivalently, the bases of Uk, are all subsets of
size k. The ﬂats of Uk,n are any subset of size at most k − 1 and [n]. Let F be a ﬂat with size s.
Theorem 3 yields that if n − s < t(k − s), then artr(Uk,n, t) = n. Otherwise we have,

artr(Uk,n, t) =

max
F : rUk,n (F )≤rUk,n (E)−2

{|F | + t(rUk,n(E) − rUk,n(F ) − 1)}

= s + t · k − t · s − t
= t(k − 1) + (1 − t)s

The maximum above is achieved when s = 0. This gives the following theorem:

Theorem 12. Let E = [n] and ﬁx 1 ≤ k ≤ n a natural number. If n < kt, then artr(Uk,n, t) = n
Otherwise,

artr(Uk,n, t) = t(k − 1).

4.6 Linear Matroids

Let F be a ﬁeld, d ≥ 2, and E a ﬁnite subset of F d. A linear matroid M = (E, I) can be deﬁned
where I consists of all linearly independent subsets of E. We assume E spans F d. Bases are just
bases of the vector space. Flats are just intersections of linear subspaces with E. The rank of a
subset S ⊆ E is just the dimension of the linear space spanned by S.

The anti-Ramsey number arℓ(E, t) of t disjoint rainbow bases is the maximum integer m such
that there exists a coloring of E with m colors that contains no t disjoint rainbow bases. Theorem
3 reads,

16

Theorem 13. Given a ﬁnite set E of F d with d ≥ 2, suppose E spans F d. If there is a subspace
S0 of F d satisfying |E| − |E ∩ S0| < t · (d − dim(S0)), then arℓ(E, t) = |E|. Otherwise,

arℓ(E, t) =

max
S : dim(S)≤d−2

where the maximum is taken among all linear subspaces S of dimension at most d − 2.

A speciﬁc example can be given when E is a cube containing the zero vector. Namely, let F
be a ﬁeld and T a ﬁnite subset of F with |T | ≥ 2 and 0 ∈ T . We consider the set E = T d ⊆ F d.
Notice that for any subspace S of dimension s, |S ∩ T d| ≤ |T |s. The equality is achieved when S
is deﬁned by setting d − s coordinates equal to 0. Let f (x) = |T |x + t(d − x). Observe that f (x)
is concave upward. The maximum of f (x) on any interval is reached at one of the ends. Since
f (d) = |T |d, the degenerate case is given by |T |d < f (0) = 1 + td. When |T |d ≥ 1 + td, we have
arℓ(T d, t) = max{f (0), f (d − 2)} − t. This implies the following result.

Theorem 14. For any ﬁnite subset T of any ﬁeld F with 0 ∈ T and |T | ≥ 2, and for any integer
d ≥ 2, we have

|T |d
1 + t(d − 1)
|T |d−2 + t
