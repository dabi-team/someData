The article deals with the extension of the relativistic double-ionization equation-of-motion coupled-cluster
(DI-EOMCC) method [H. Pathak et al. Phys. Rev. A 90, 010501(R) (2014)] for the molecular systems. The
Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian with four-component spinors is considered to take care of the relativistic
eﬀects. The implemented method is employed to compute a few low-lying doubly ionized states of noble
gas atoms (Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn) and Cl2, Br2, HBr, and HI. Additionally, we presented results with two
intermediate schemes in the four-component relativistic DI-EOMCC framework to understand the role of
electron correlation. The computed double ionization spectra for the atomic systems are compared with the
values from the non-relativistic DI-EOMCC method with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) [Z. Wang et al. J. Chem.
Phys. 142, 144109 (2015)] and the values from the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST)
database. Our atomic results are found to be in good agreement with the NIST values. Further, the obtained
results for the molecular systems agree well with the available experimental values.

INTRODUCTION

There has been considerable progress in the last few
decades in the experimental techniques for the study of
di-cationic ions.1–6 The doubly charged ions are highly
reactive, and they play an important role in ionized gases,
excimer lasers, plasmas, and interstellar clouds, which
attracted much attention from both experimentalists and
theoreticians.7–10

The unambiguous theoretical prediction of the double-
ionization spectra demands a reliable theory. The cor-
rectness and authenticity of the calculated values depend
on the quality of the wavefunction in describing the quan-
tum systems. Therefore, it is obligatory to have a highly
correlated method that can provide a better description
of the ionized states. Besides, electron correlation, rela-
tivistic eﬀects has a signiﬁcant contribution to describe
the simultaneous removal of two electrons. Thus, concur-
rent treatment of both the eﬀects of relativity and elec-
tron correlation is mandatory due to their intertwined
nature.11,12

The

self-consistent-ﬁeld (SCF)

solution consider-
ing Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian with four-component
spinors provides the best possible single determinan-
tal description of the eﬀects of relativity in a quantum

many-body calculations. On the other hand, coupled-
cluster theory13–15 becomes the most acceded many-
body method while dealing with the electron correlation.
Therefore, the development of a relativistic coupled-
cluster theory will be the means to engage with these
problems.

Kaldor and coworkers extensively worked on the
relativistic coupled-cluster theory.16–22 They extended
the Fock-space multireference coupled-cluster theory
(FSMRCC)23–30 to the relativistic framework to calcu-
late transition energies.17,20–22 The eﬀective Hamilto-
nian variant of the FSMRCC theory encounters con-
vergence diﬃculty with an increase in the size of the
model space. The intermediate Hamiltonian Fock-space
multireference coupled-cluster (IHFSMRCC) theory31–33
and the MRCC theory based on eigenvalue indepen-
dent partitioning (EIP-MRCC)34,35 are quite impressive
in predicting spectroscopic properties in an intruder-free
manner.

As an alternative, the equation-of-motion coupled-
cluster (EOMCC) method42–60 becomes popular due
to its simple CI-like eigenvalue structure, hassle-free
convergence, and the possibility of obtaining shake-
up states those are important in explaining photo-
ionization spectra,61 and various radiation-less decay
mechanism.62 Furthermore, the EOMCC method di-
rectly provides the eigenstates contrary to the propaga-
tor based approaches,63,64 even though these methods
share similar EOM structure. We would like to emphasis
that the EOMCC method works well at the noninter-
acting limit; however, it lacks the rigorous deﬁnition of

the size-extensivity. The values computed by the FSM-
RCC theory and the EOMCC method cease to agree
with each other beyond the principal peaks of the one-

valence sector. Coupled-cluster linear response theory
(CCLRT)65–68 and symmetry adapted cluster conﬁgura-
tion interaction (SAC-CI) method69–71 are the alterna-

tive avenues for the calculation of direct energy diﬀer-
ences closely related to the EOMCC method. Chaud-
huri et al. employed relativistic CCLRT within the four-
component formalism for the calculation of single ioniza-
tion potential of closed-shell atomic systems.72,73

It is desirable to introduce the eﬀects of relativity
in the electronic structure calculations by choosing an
appropriate relativistic Hamiltonian. The use of rela-
tivistic eﬀective-core-potential (RECP) with spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) is the most common in molecular rela-
tivistic calculations. A wide range of RECPs are avail-
able, depending on how the RECPs are optimized.74–77
It helps to exclude a large number of chemically inert
electrons from the SCF calculations to reduce the com-
putational costs for the correlation calculation as com-
pared to the fully relativistic counterparts. The eﬀects
of SOC has been introduced in diﬀerent variants of the
EOMCC method.78–86 However, the inclusion of the SOC
with RECP does not address the intricate coupling be-
tween the relativistic and correlation eﬀects.12,87 There-
fore, it is essential to have a more robust theory consider-
ing relativistic Hamiltonian with four-component wave-
function and a highly correlated method for the treat-
ment of the electron correlation. Further, we would like
to categorically point out that the SOC eﬀect is natu-
rally taken care of by the Dirac-Hamiltonian.88 The use of
Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is most common in relativis-
tic electronic structure calculation where the two-body
Coulomb operator is added with the one-body Dirac-
Hamiltonian. The mathematical form of the Coulomb
operator is the same as in the non-relativistic theory;
however, the physical meaning is diﬀerent as it takes
care of the spin-same orbit interaction. The relativis-
tic Hamiltonian containing up to Coulomb term is suf-
ﬁcient for almost all chemical purposes.89,90 However, if
unprecedented accurate results are sought especially for
the ﬁne-structure splitting from the deep core orbitals,
in such a case consideration of the spin-other-orbit inter-
action and spin-spin interaction become relevant which
require full inclusion of the Breit part of the two-body
interaction.

The four-component relativistic EOMCC method has
been implemented for the computation of
ionization
potential,91 electron aﬃnity,92 and excitation energies,93
of closed-shell heavy atomic systems, as well as for highly
charged ions.94 The atomic relativistic calculations en-
joy the exploitation of the spherical symmetry, which
permits separate computation of the radial and angu-
lar part to work with the numerically evaluated reduced
matrix elements. On the other hand, in the spherical
atomic implementation, the use of the antisymmetrized
two-body matrix elements is not feasible due to the ap-
pearance of the diﬀerent angular factors for the direct and
exchange part of the two-body matrix elements. Thus,
this non-separability of radial and angular part in the
non-spherical case makes molecular relativistic calcula-
tions onerous. The EOMCC methods for the calcula-
tions of ionization potentials,95 and electron aﬃnities96

3

of molecular systems considering both four-component,
as well as exact two-component (X2C) formalism90,97
have been implemented and shed light on the non-
additivity of the relativistic eﬀects and electron corre-
lation eﬀects through calculations.95 Further, we have
implemented the open-shell reference four-component
EOMCC method and applied to calculate ionization po-
tential of super-heavy atomic and molecular systems us-
ing DC Hamiltonian.98 Recently, Shee et al.99 used Dirac-
Coulomb-Gaunt Hamiltonian in their implementation of
the EOMCC method.

The simultaneous removal of two electrons is a seri-
ous multireference problem. The EOMCC method for
double ionization potentials (DIPs),100–105 and double
electron aﬃnities (DEAs)105–107 has been developed to
deal with the complex multireference problem within a
single-reference description. However, those works are in
the non-relativistic framework. Further, we have imple-
mented four-component relativistic DI-EOMCC method
for closed-shell atomic systems and employed to calculate
valence DIP values of alkaline earth metal atoms where
valence electrons are well separated from the other inner
electrons.108

In this work, we extend the four-component DI-
EOMCC method using DC Hamiltonian108 based on an-
tisymmetrized actual two-body matrix elements applica-
ble to both atomic and molecular systems starting from
their closed-shell conﬁguration. We have employed to
calculate a few low-lying doubly-ionized states of noble
gas atoms (Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) and molecular systems (Cl2,
Br2, HBr, and HI).

The ground state reference wavefunction is deﬁned at
the coupled-cluster single- and double- excitation level
(CCSD) and the EOM matrix constructed in the 2h and
3h-1p space. Further, two intermediate schemes have
been designed to analyse the roles of correlation contribu-
tions; one uses the ground state description of the second-
order many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(2)], and in
the later the EOM matrix is constructed only in the 2h
space.

The outline of this paper is as follows. A brief descrip-
tion of the DI-EOMCC method is presented in Sec. II.
Sec. III and Sec. IV are allocated for details of the com-
putational parameters and about the discussion of the ob-
tained results in our calculations, respectively. Finally,
we convey our concluding thoughts in Sec. V. Atomic
units are consistently used unless otherwise stated.

II. METHOD

The wavefunction in the EOMCC method is deﬁned
as ReT |Φ0i, where eT |Φ0i is the coupled-cluster ground
state wavefunction and |Φ0i is the restricted closed-shell
reference determinant. T is the usual cluster operator
and the R is a linear-operator. The R operator acts
upon the coupled-cluster ground state wavefunction and
generates the excited state conﬁgurations. The second-

quantization form of the cluster-operator T and the EOM
operator R is as follows,

respectively. We have restricted our DI-EOMCC imple-
mentation up to T = T1 + T2 and R = R2 + R3 excitation
level. The ﬁrst step for the EOMCC calculation is the
solution of the cluster amplitudes in Eq. 1. These ampli-
tudes are obtained by iterative solution of the following
non-linear simultaneous equations,

as the R operator is determined by solving the following
equation:

ionized state.

scribed in the Ref.109 ˆP (i . . . |j . . . ) stands for the cyclic
permutation operator. The above equations can be ex-
pressed in the matrix form as ¯HR = R∆Eν . The size of
the ¯H matrix is large enough (nh2 + nh3np, nh2 + nh3np,
nh and np stand for the number of holes and particles,
respectively) to follow a full diagonalization algorithm
in a reasonable basis. Therefore, we have used David-

son diagonalization algorithm110 for the diagonalization
of the non-Hermitian matrix. The DI-EOMCC method is
prone to slow convergence. Therefore, to obtain a smooth
and faster convergence, we have used eigenvectors ob-
tained from the full diagonalization of 2h block as an
initial guess for the iterative procedure. The intermedi-
ate scheme MBPT(2) approximates CCSD ground state
wavefunction at the second-order many-body perturba-
tion theory level and for the 2h scheme, the dimension of
the EOM matrix is restricted to (nh2, nh2), by ignoring
contribution from the 3h − 1p block.

III. COMPUTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

The SCF solution using DC Hamiltonian and the re-
quired one-body and two-body matrix elements for the
correlation calculations are obtained from the DIRAC14
program package.111 Consideration of ﬁnite size nuclear
model is most suited for the relativistic electronic struc-
ture calculations. Therefore, the Gaussian charge density
distribution nuclear model is taken into account to mimic
the eﬀects of the ﬁnite size nucleus. All the parameters
for this model are taken as default.112 The contribution
from the high-lying orbitals in a correlation calculation is
inconsequential due to their large energy values. There-
fore, we have restricted the number of virtual orbitals
on the basis of energy criteria. The orbitals above a
threshold value are discarded from the correlation cal-
culations. The details of the basis set, threshold energy
cutoﬀ for the virtual orbitals including the number of oc-
cupied and virtual spinors are reported in Tab. I. The
two-body matrix elements below 10−12 are neglected in
all our calculations due to their negligible contribution
in the correlation calculations. SCF calculations are per-
formed with a cutoﬀ of 10−7 for the norm of the error
vector. The ground state coupled-cluster calculations
uses convergence cutoﬀ of 10−9 and a DIIS space of 6.
The DI-EOMCC method uses convergence threshold of
10−5. Scalar real Gaussian functions constitute the ﬁ-
nite atomic orbital basis and are used in our calculations
in an uncontracted fashion. Dyall.cv3z36 basis is cho-

sen for Ar. We opted Dyall.acv3z basis37 for Kr and
Xe and dyall.acv4z37 basis for the Rn atom. For the
molecular systems, dyall.acv3z36 basis is chosen for Cl in
Cl2, and dyall.cv3z37 basis is for Br atom in Br2. aug-
cc-pVTZ38 basis is chosen for the H atom in both HBr
and HI. Dyall.av3z37 basis is used for Br in HBr and
dyall.ae3z37 basis has opted for I in HI. We have used ex-
perimental bond-length of 1.9870˚A, 2.2810˚A, 1.4140˚A ,
and 1.6090˚A for Cl2, Br2, HBr, and HI respectively and
these values are taken from the Ref.113

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The correlation energies from MBPT(2) and CCSD
calculations are reported in Tab.
I. The obtained cor-
relation energies are compared with the values from the
DIRAC14111 to test the correctness of the implementa-
tion of the ground state calculations. Our results from
the correlation calculations match with the DIRAC14
values up to 8-digit after the decimal point. We have
carried out several calculations and found that the agree-
ment is irrespective of the chemical systems or basis sets.
The discrepency beyond this limit is due to the use of
diﬀerent convergence algorithm or the cutoﬀ used in the
storage of the two-body matrix elements.

In Tab.

II, we reported results with various basis
sets, and Hamiltonian and taken Kr as an example for
comparison. A two-component description is needed

to represent SOC eﬀects. For the relativistic eﬀective-
core-potential (RECP), we have used contracted Gaus-
sian functions, with point nucleus in a similar fashion
as done with scalar-relativistic Hamiltonian with SOC
eﬀects. The calculations using 4-component wavefunc-
tion with DC Hamiltonian are also calculated with the
same number of virtual orbital in identical conditions.
We have used ECPDS10MDF40 relativistic eﬀective-core-
potentials (RECP) which is optimized at the multiconﬁg-
uration Hartree-Fock level using Dirac-Coulomb Hamil-
tonian. It also includes contributions from the Breit in-
teraction. The spin-free calculation is a one-component
in nature. We have used aug-cc-pVTZ39 basis for the
comparison. The results justify a clear improvement for
4-component calculations using DC Hamiltonian over the
spin-free version of the RECP and even with the in-
clusion of spin-orbit interaction. We have also done a
few more calculations with the Dyall basis sets those
are uncontracted in nature and specially designed for
the purpose of relativistic calculations. The calculations
with Dirac-Coulomb or Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt Hamilto-
nian with 4-component wavefunction uses ﬁnite nuclear
(Gaussian charge density distribution) model. Relativis-
tic solutions have a singularity, and in an approximate
treatment (Gaussian basis), it is harder to treat a singu-
larity. However, a ﬁnite nucleus model helps to get rid of
the singularity of the orbitals. The variations of the DIP
values for a given state over the range of chosen basis sets
is a maximum of ∼0.2 eV. The contributions of the high-
lying orbitals in the computed values beyond 500 Hartree
is negligible. It is also found that the maximum contribu-
tion of Gaunt term is about 0.05 eV, though the current
implementation of DIRAC111 is includes the Gaunt inter-

6

action only in the construction of the Fock matrix and
transformation of the Gaunt part of the two-electron op-
erator to the molecular orbital (MO) basis is yet to done.
The numerical results of the lowest ﬁve double-ionized
states calculated using the four-component relativistic
DI-EOMCC method by simultaneously removing two-
electrons from the closed-shell conﬁguration are pre-
sented in Tab. III. Further, the results from the interme-
diate calculations using MBPT(2) and the 2h schemes
are also compiled in the same table. All these meth-
ods are employed to noble gas atoms (Ar, Kr, Xe, and
Rn). We have compared our results with the values from
DI-EOMCC calculations with SOC eﬀects.84 Finally, all
these values are tested against the NIST41 database. It is
observed that both MBPT(2) and the 2h scheme tend to
overestimate DI-EOMCC results; however, the deviation
is larger for the 2h scheme. 2h scheme lacks the contribu-
tions of the 3h − 1p block which is a major source of non-
dynamical electron correlation. The ground state deﬁned
at the MBPT(2) level is rather a better approximation
than the 2h scheme. The DI-EOMCC results are found to
be very accurate in comparison to the NIST41 database
for Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms, and there is a clear improve-
ment over the DI-EOMCC results with SOC eﬀects.84
The employed virtual subspace for the chosen basis set
for the Rn atom is rather small and gives results simi-
lar to the values reported by Wang et al.84 In their work,
the SOC eﬀect is treated perturbatively for the post SCF
part using a scalar-relativistic Hamiltonian. The RECPs
are used for taking care of the relativistic eﬀects, and the
one-electron SOC operator is taken from the RECP oper-
ator. However, they disregarded the two-electron part of
the SOC operator.12 Such treatment of the SOC operator
leads to a gross overestimation of spin-orbit eﬀects.118,119
There is a large deviation (2.4 eV) from the experimental
value reported in the NIST41 database. We take note of
the experimental value, which is reported with an uncer-
tainty of 1.9 eV.

Further, we employed all the three schemes in the DI-
EOMCC framework to molecular systems (Cl2, Br2, HBr,
and HI) and compared with the available experimental
values. These results are tabulated in Tab.
IV. The
reported values for all the states computed using DI-
EOMCC scheme with CCSD as a reference wavefunction
are found to be very accurate and relative deviation is
well within 2.0% from the experimental values. The de-
viation of the MBPT(2) results are less in comparison
to the 2h approximation from the experimental values.
Therefore, MBPT(2) is a better approximation than the
2h method in the EOMCC framework.

V. CONCLUSION

We have successfully implemented the relativistic DI-
EOMCC method using four-component Dirac spinors for
the calculation of double-ionization spectra. The imple-
mentation is a general one based on anti-symmetrized ac-

tual two-body matrix elements. It supports both atomic
and molecular systems starting from their closed-shell
conﬁguration. The implemented method is employed to
compute a few low-lying doubly-ionized states of both
atoms and molecules. The results of our relativistic DI-
EOMCC method found to be very accurate in compar-
ison to the available experimental values. The outcome
of our computation suggests that the MBPT(2)-EOMCC
method is a better approximation than the 2h-EOMCC
scheme.
