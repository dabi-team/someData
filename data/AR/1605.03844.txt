Abstract

The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment operates at the Sanford

Underground Research Facility to detect nuclear recoils from the hypotheti-

cal Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on a liquid xenon target.

Liquid xenon typically contains trace amounts of the noble radioactive isotopes

85Kr and 39Ar that are not removed by the in situ gas puriﬁcation system. The

decays of these isotopes at concentrations typical of research-grade xenon would

be a dominant background for a WIMP search experiment. To remove these

impurities from the liquid xenon, a chromatographic separation system based

on adsorption on activated charcoal was built. 400 kg of xenon was processed,

reducing the average concentration of krypton from 130 ppb to 3.5 ppt as mea-

sured by a cold-trap assisted mass spectroscopy system. A 50 kg batch spiked

to 0.001 g/g of krypton was processed twice and reduced to an upper limit of

0.2 ppt.

1. Introduction

Liquid xenon is an excellent target for the direct detection of WIMP dark

matter [1], particularly when instrumented in a time projection chamber (TPC)

as in the LUX detector [2]. Xenon’s high proton number allows a very short

penetration depth of external gamma and beta radiation [3, 4], and the event-by-

event position measurement of the TPC allows these backgrounds to be highly

suppressed in the inner volume of the detector. Because it has no long-lived

radioactive isotopes [5], xenon is intrinsically quiet. The average single-scatter

rate in the energy window of 0.9–5.3 keVee

1 inside the 118 kg ﬁducial mass in

LUX is measured to be below 10−3 events per kg/day/keV (diﬀerential rate

unit, DRUee) [6]. This rate is dominated by the gamma rays from radioactive

impurities in the 122 Hamamatsu R8778 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) [7].

Xenon, being distilled from the atmosphere, contains noble radioactive im-

purities such as 85Kr and 39Ar with half-lives of 10.756 yrs and 269 yrs, respec-

tively. [8, 9]. Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

85Kr is generated by anthropogenic ﬁssion, and released into the atmosphere

primarily during nuclear fuel reprocessing [10]. It contributes about 1 Bq/m3

of the radioactivity from atmosphere [11], from which one can deduce that

about 10 parts-per-trillion (ppt, 10−12) (g/g)2 of atmospheric Kr is 85Kr. A

measurement based on low-level counting reported 4–22.5 ppt [12]. Research-

grade xenon contains about 10−7 natural krypton by mass. One analysis of

boil-oﬀ gas of a distillation tower revealed that 6±2 ppt of the krypton impurity

is 85Kr in their sample [13]. At these concentrations, the decay of 85Kr yields

a rate of about 6 DRUee, which overwhelms the potential dark matter signal.

To be comparable to the background rate due to the PMTs, the xenon in LUX

must contain less than 20 ppt krypton. The goal for LUX to reduce the 85Kr

39Ar is mainly generated by the 40Ar + n → 39Ar + 2n process in the atmo-

sphere due to cosmic rays, and constitutes about 1 ppq of argon in the atmo-

sphere [9]. The isotope emits a beta particle with an endpoint of 0.565 MeV.

The LUX research-grade xenon originally contained about 1 ppb of argon. How-

ever, a portion of xenon was retrieved from other experiments, and contained

an unknown amount of argon. For its background rate to be comparable to that

from the photomultiplier tubes in the ﬁducial volume, the argon concentration

must be reduced below ppb.

Cryogenic distillation has been used to separate these light radioactive noble

impurities from xenon. The XMASS detector is a single-phase dark matter

detector containing 800 kg of liquid xenon. The XMASS collaboration developed

a cryogenic distillation column to reduce the krypton level in xenon. Their

distillation column lowered the krypton concentration by a factor of 1, 000 to

1.9 ppt of krypton [14]. A similar system was adopted by the XENON100

collaboration [15], and dropped their krypton concentration below 1 ppt [16].

2. Adsorption-Based Chromatography

Adsorption-based chromatography is widely used for gas separation in in-

dustrial and chemical applications. A common industrial application is the

4

separation of nitrogen from air, known as “pressure swing adsorption.” Among

the scientiﬁc applications, the Borexino [17] and NEMO-2 [18] collaborations

developed a charcoal adsorption system to remove atmospheric radon from un-

derground laboratory air, while a similar system removed krypton from xenon

for the XENON-10 experiment [19]. The latter system processed 20 kg of xenon

in 2 months, with the ﬁnal krypton concentration below 3 ppt. In this section,

we present a mathematical treatment of adsorption-based gas chromatography

central to our application, following the approach presented in [17]. More gen-

eral reviews are available in the literature [20].

Adsorption refers to adhesion of atoms or molecules on a surface. The typical

binding energy for adsorption is smaller than that of covalent bonds, and the

process is reversible:

R + X (cid:42)(cid:41) RX.

(1)

Here, X is the molecule to be adsorbed, or adsorbate, on the sites provided by

R, the adsorbent.

The equilibrium between the free and the adsorbed states of Eq. 1 depends

principally on a few parameters: the adsorbate, the adsorbent, the ambient

temperature, and the concentration of adsorbate. A simple parametrization

for mono-layer adsorption was proposed by Langmuir [21]. The fraction θ of

the sites occupied is described as a function of the partial pressure P of the

adsorbent:

θ =

KP
1 + KP

.

(2)

K is the equilibrium constant, the ratio of adsorption and desorption rates in

Eq. 1.

It has a dimension of inverse pressure because the rate of adsorption

is proportional to the partial pressure of X.

If P is large, θ converges to 1,

indicating that all sites are occupied.

At low P (KP (cid:28) 1), θ depends linearly on P :

S = S0θ = S0KP = bP.

(3)

Here, S is the molecular density of the adsorbate on the adsorbed state per

unit mass of adsorbent, and S0 is the maximum value of S. Therefore, S is

5

proportional to the partial pressure of the adsorbate in the free state, and the

new constant b is referred to as the Henry constant.

The partial pressure P is proportional to the number density y = N

V of the

adsorbate in the free state by the ideal gas law, which allows us to write:

S = bkBT y = ky.

(4)

The new constant, k, is called the adsorption constant, and is a ratio of the

molecular densities of the adsorbate on the adsorbent (Nads/M ) to that of the

gas phase (Ng/V ):

k =

Nads/M
Ng/V

.

(5)

It quantiﬁes the aﬃnity of the adsorbate to the adsorbent. Diﬀerences in the

adsorption constant (or the Henry constant) between adsorbates leads to diﬀer-

ent duration spent by the adsorbates in the desorbed phase. For example, the

adsorption constants of xenon and krypton, calculated from [22] at 300 K, are

1.15 and 0.064 l/g, respectively, diﬀerent by a factor of 19.

Adsorption-based chromatography utilizes the diﬀerence of the adsorption

strength among the adsorbates. In a chromatographic column, a “carrier ﬂuid”

ﬂows through the bed of the adsorbent, carrying along a dilute adsorbate ﬂuid.

The average speed of each adsorbate through the bed is dependent on the frac-

tion of time it spends in the mobile phase. Adsorbates that bond more strongly

to the adsorbent spend smaller fractions of their time in the mobile phase and

thus have lower average speed through the column. The carrier ﬂuid itself is

chosen to rarely interact with the adsorbent. Fig. 1 shows xenon and krypton

exiting a charcoal column at diﬀerent times.

A commonly used simpliﬁed model of the propagation of an adsorbate in

a chromatographic column assumes that the chromatographic column consists

of NH height-equivalent theoretical stages (HETS) as shown in Fig. 2. Each

HETS has a volume V and contains adsorbent of mass m. The number of gas

molecules in each stage is the sum of those in the gaseous and adsorbed phases,

and can be written using the terms deﬁned in Eq. 4:

N = Sm + yV ≈ Sm = ykm.

concentration in arbitrary units as measured with an residual gas analyzer (RGA). The xenon

is mixed with 10−2 mole fraction krypton to enhance the krypton concentration above the

RGA baseline. The x-axis is minutes since the beginning of the xenon feed, which lasts for the

ﬁrst 15 minutes. During the ﬁrst 100 minutes, the helium-krypton mixture exiting the column

is trapped in cooled charcoal. At minute 100, xenon begins to exit the charcoal column, and

the ﬂow is redirected to a condenser, where the xenon is collected. The black dashed line is

a theoretical expectation from Eq. 9, applied only to the krypton behavior, which is in the

appropriate linear regime. This cycle used 2 kg of xenon, and helium as a carrier gas.

theoretical stages (HETS). Each stage contains a charcoal mass m in a volume V and an

height of H. The mobile phase moves through the column with a volume speed of φ. The

number density of the adsorbate in the mobile phase at the ith stage, yi, depends on φ and

yi−1.

The approximation holds when the number of molecules adsorbed is much

greater than the number in the gas phase.

In the ith stage, the change in the number of molecules in time dt is the

diﬀerence between the incoming ﬂux and the outgoing ﬂux:

dNi = yi−1φdt − yiφdt.

where φ is the volume swept by unit time, or volume ﬂow.

is referred to as “retention time.” Here, M ≡ NH m is the total mass of the

adsorbent in the column.

An analytic solution of Eq. 7 exists for a special case when the column is

initially empty of adsorbates and the input feed of the adsorbates looks like a

Dirac-delta function at t = 0:

τ .

For large NH , this is very close to τ , which is also called the “breakthrough

time”. For faster production and ﬁner separation of gases, lower τ and higher

NH are desired.

The height H of a HETS depends on the linear velocity u of the mobile

phase in the column as parametrized by Van Deemter [23]:

H = A +

B

+ Cu.

(10)

A represents the contribution from Eddy currents in the column, i.e., the many

possible paths the molecules can ﬁnd in the packed column. B/u represents

diﬀusion in the longitudinal direction; and Cu represents the dispersion due to

the non-uniformity of u, mostly caused by the porosity of the stationary phase.

Eq. 10 provides guidance as to the optimal ﬂow rate of the mobile phase and the

optimal shape of the column. The minimum H, which maximizes NH , occurs at

(cid:113) B

u =

C . A modern summary of the Van Deemter equation and its coeﬃcients

for gas chromatography can be found in Ref. [20].

Eq. 9 assumes that the density of the adsorbates in the adsorbed state is

linearly proportional to its partial pressure as shown in Eq. 3, and it does not

count the competing adsorption between the multiple adsorbates. Because the

goal of our production system is to process the greatest mass of xenon per

unit time, a high ratio of adsorbate molecules to adsorbent mass is preferred,

and the observed output deviates from Eq. 9. The deviation leads to earlier

breakthrough of xenon and the broadening of the peaks, both of which result in

worse separation. Saturation of the adsorbent sites with xenon limits the mass

of xenon that can be processed in a cycle as we optimize for fast production at

adequate separation.

Although chemically inactive, noble gases such as xenon and krypton can

adsorb on activated charcoal or molecular sieve [22, 24]. Polarization of their

electron shells by the induced electric dipoles of the charcoal surface leads to an

attractive potential. Its strong aﬃnity can be explained by the large conductive

9

microscopic surface area. Activated charcoal is readily available commercially.

Helium is a good mobile phase because it is chemically extremely stable and

does not compete for adsorption on the charcoal [25]. Helium does not have any

naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, and can be easily removed by freezing

the xenon on a liquid-nitrogen cooled surface and pumping away the helium

carrier gas.

3. System Design & Operation

A schematic diagram of the LUX krypton removal system is shown in Fig. 3.

More technical details are available in [26]. A regulated ﬂow of xenon containing

a trace contamination of krypton is fed into a 60 cm × 60 cm (diameter × height)

column ﬁlled with 60 kg of activated OVC 4x8 charcoal from CalgonCarbon R(cid:13) at

ambient temperature. The xenon is injected into the top of the charcoal column

while the helium carrier gas continues to circulate through the column. The

carrier gas moves the krypton and xenon through the column at diﬀerent rates

due to the diﬀerence in their adsorption strength. The krypton exits the column

ﬁrst, and ﬂows into a “krypton trap.” The krypton trap is a 1.5-inch-diameter

stainless steel tube ﬁlled with 500 g of activated charcoal that is immersed in

a liquid nitrogen bath (77 K). At this temperature the krypton retention time

is much longer than the processing time, and the krypton eﬀectively freezes on

to the charcoal while the helium carrier gas is still highly mobile. The puriﬁed

helium gas exits the trap and circulates back into the column. This process

is called the “chromatography cycle,” and lasts until xenon emerges out of the

column. During the chromatography cycle, the mass ﬂow of helium is driven

by a diaphragm pump and regulated by a mass ﬂow controller in front of the

column to stabilize the ﬂow rate and the pressure inside the charcoal column.

The “xenon recovery cycle” is triggered when xenon emerging from the col-

umn is detected by a sampling residual gas analyzer (RGA). The xenon-helium

mixture is redirected from the charcoal column into a condenser. The condenser

is a cryogenic vessel with an internal volume of about 1 m3, cooled to 77 K.

10

While the processed xenon is frozen inside the condenser, helium gas passes

through unimpeded and is fed back into the charcoal column to complete the

cycle. A Roots blower (Edwards EH250) connected in series with its backing

pump (Alcatel Adixen ACP40) at the output of the column generate 2000 liter

per minute (lpm) of volume ﬂow to accelerate the xenon recovery. The pres-

sure inside the column is kept at 10–20 mbar. The RGA at the output of the

backing pump, whose details are discussed in Sec. 4, monitors the output gas

from the column in real time. Once all the processed xenon is recovered from

the column, a new cycle with the next batch of raw xenon begins. After several

cycles, the helium carrier is pumped out of the condenser and discarded, and the

accumulated clean xenon is warmed, evaporated, and transferred into a storage

cylinder for transportation to the LUX experiment.

The system is designed to mitigate the possible sources of contamination.

One such source is air: 1 liter of air contains as much krypton as the ﬁnal

400 kg of xenon after puriﬁcation to the 4 ppt LUX goal. The system is

vacuum-sealed to minimize contamination from external air. Another concern

is that krypton can dissolve in plastic components or pump lubricant and can

be released at a later time, mixing with the puriﬁed xenon. To minimize such

cross-contamination, most of the system is made of stainless-steel tubing and

most of its joints are sealed by metal gaskets. There still are a few non-metallic

components that cannot be removed, such as rubber O-rings and ﬁlters. A

rough estimate of the cross-contamination through these components is less

than 1 × 10−7 of the total krypton [26].

The separation and the production rates depend on the pressure and the

volume ﬂow rate inside the charcoal column. For our application, we wish to

maximize the mass of xenon processed per batch, and this requirement forces us

to operate in the partially-saturated non-linear regime, where the elution curve

estimation from Eq. 9 no longer holds. The optimal operation parameters for the

maximum process rate and the krypton reduction factor were found empirically

by measuring the output concentration under various conditions. The raw xenon

begins with a krypton contamination at a concentration of 130 ppb, below the

11

Figure 3: Block diagram of the LUX Kr removal system at Case Western Reserve Univer-

sity (CWRU). The xenon supply with its trace krypton enters the charcoal column under the

inﬂuence of a circulating stream of helium. The helium ﬁrst carries out the krypton, which is

collected in a charcoal trap at 77 K. Then the xenon is detected exiting the column and the

valves are set to direct the column output to the condenser, where the xenon is collected at

77 K. After multiple such cycles, the helium is pumped away and discarded, and the processed

frozen xenon is warmed and cryo-pumped into a storage cylinder for transportation. While

the xenon is cryo-pumped, the krypton trap is separately warmed and purged with helium to

clean it for the next round.

time-dependent concentration of the krypton exiting the charcoal column, a

1:100 mol/mol mixture of krypton and xenon is used. Fig 1 shows the mixture

separated in the system monitored by the RGA. Measurements from diﬀerent

column pressures, xenon feed rate, and xenon feed mass were compared.

For the chromatography cycle, maximal separation of the peaks is the pri-

mary concern. The pressure inside the charcoal column is directly related to the

diﬀusion constant of the gas, represented by the B term in Eq. 10. In the sys-

tem, the cross-sectional area of the column is larger than the optimal area based

on the pumping speed, and the system operated in the region where the B term

in Eq. 10 dominated. The results also supported the expectation that a higher

pressure inside the column leads to larger separation of the peaks and a narrower

krypton peak. We ﬁnd that a 500 mbar column pressure with a 50 standard liter

per minute (slpm) helium ﬂow rate are the optimal chromatography conditions

for our system.

The primary concern for the xenon recovery cycle is its duration. Due to

its strong bonding, xenon moves slowly through the charcoal column, and the

duration of the xenon recovery cycle dominates the overall production rate.

Eq. 8 suggests that the xenon retention time can be reduced by using a higher

volume ﬂow rate. The Roots blower provided a ﬁve-fold higher volume ﬂow

rate compared to the system described in [19] at pressures in 5–30 mbar range,

and kept the recovery cycle duration at three hours even though the charcoal

column mass had increased sixfold.

Once the system was built, the optimal operating parameters were found

through a series of tests. The feed rate and the feed mass of xenon can change the

quality of the separation. While we wish to maximize the production mass per

unit time, too much xenon relative to charcoal leads to non-optimal saturation of

the adsorbent and worse separation. Similarly, a high xenon feed rate can locally

saturate charcoal and lead to worse separation. Again, because the adsorption

is nonlinear, the optimal feed rate was found empirically.

A series of tests using the enriched krypton mixture leads to the following

13

parameters for chromatography in the system. The column is kept at a pressure

of 500 mbar during chromatography, with a 50 slpm helium mass ﬂow. A 2-kg

batch of xenon is injected over 20 minutes. The krypton output peaks at about

40 minutes after the start, and lasts until xenon emerges from the column, at

about 115 minutes. The detection of xenon triggers the recovery cycle. First,

the output ﬂow is re-directed to the condenser, and the vacuum backup pump

reduces the column pressure below 100 mbar. When the pressure is low enough,

the Roots blower activates and recovers the clean xenon from the column into

the condenser. A constant helium ﬂow of 15–20 slpm keeps the pressure inside

the column at 10–20 mbar. The recovery cycle lasts three hours, and one full

cycle processes 2 kg of xenon in 5 hours. A typical source cylinder contains

about 50 kg of xenon, which is processed in 25 cycles. The processed xenon is

accumulated in the condenser. When the source cylinder is empty, the helium in

the condenser is pumped out, and the processed xenon is warmed and transferred

via pressure gradient into a storage cylinder that is cooled by liquid nitrogen.

A total 395 kg of xenon was processed for LUX in four months, between the

15th of September 2012 and the 10th of January 2013. Most of the processes

were executed automatically with minimal operator intervention. The process

of pumping away the helium and transferring the xenon to a storage bottle was

done manually, and typically took one day. Less than 1 kg (or 0.2%) of xenon

was lost, mostly due to operator errors. The key parameters are summarized in

Table 2, and compared with the results from other systems.

4. Product Sampling & Assaying

Two sampling RGAs are used to monitor the composition of the gas in the

system in real time. One RGA is mounted after the output of the vacuum pump

to monitor the gas exiting the charcoal column before it enters the Kr trap or

the condenser. The second RGA monitors the gas outputs of the Kr trap and

the condenser.

In addition, at every transfer from the condenser to the storage cylinder, a

sample of the processed xenon is collected from the storage cylinder. The sample

reﬂects the average gas concentrations from the multiple cycles that went into

the storage cylinder.

The processed xenon from a single cycle can be sampled, too. A four-liter

evacuated cryogenic bottle is attached to a spur from the path from the vacuum

pump to the condenser. The valve to the bottle opens to the xenon stream

during the xenon recovery phase, and the sample is collected until the pressure

of the system is equalized by the helium in the stream.

The krypton content of the processed xenon samples is measured indepen-

dently oﬀ site using a high-sensitivity assaying system at the University of

Maryland. The system utilizes a liquid nitrogen cold trap to separate impu-

rities from the xenon. When the xenon sample ﬂows through the cold trap, the

bulk xenon freezes as it contacts the surfaces cooled by a liquid nitrogen bath,

while impurities such as krypton mostly pass through in observable quantities.

The changing concentration of the impurities over the process of the assaying is

shown in Fig. 4. The absolute level of impurities is deduced by comparing the

krypton to calibration samples. The sensitivity to krypton is 0.3 ppt [30, 31].

Figure 4: (top) A xenon sample (LSB3) in which an 18.2 ppt krypton signal is detected. Each

line corresponds to the partial pressure of a gas in the sample. The initial rise in partial

pressures is due to freezing a small amount of xenon in the cold trap, while the later rise and

fall in the partial pressures is due to opening and closing a leak valve to begin and end the

assay process. (bottom) The ﬂow rate into the cold trap is indicated.

We claim no krypton detection when the krypton partial pressure does not

trace the ﬂow rate over time as shown in Fig. 5. An upper limit is set by

assuming that a signal one standard deviation above the noise can be detected.

Higher ﬂow rates produce larger signals and allow for the best sensitivity.

The assay results from the production run are summarized in Fig. 6. The

average concentration of krypton dropped from 130 ppb to 4 ppt. The average

reduction factor is 3 × 104, including batches that were processed twice. The

best reduction factor from a single processing is also about 3 × 104. One of

the double-processed batches had < 0.2 ppt of krypton, a limit set by the

assaying sensitivity. More tests are necessary to determine whether fundamental

chromatography or cross-contamination limited the reduction factor.

In addition to krypton, the assay measured the levels of other impurities

including nitrogen (57 ppb), oxygen (16 ppb), argon (1.3 ppb), and methane

(< 1 ppb). All are lower after the production. Residual helium from the pro-

cessing is a concern because it can degrade the PMTs by diﬀusing through the

quartz windows. Assays indicated that the helium concentration was reduced

to 3.2 ppb, far below that in air, and it presented no threat.

Analysis of the WIMP search data from the 2013 run of the LUX experiment

independently constrained the 85Kr contamination in the xenon by searching for

its decay signature. A small fraction (0.434%) of 85Kr decays can be tagged by

their unique signatures: a 173 keV beta followed by a 514 keV gamma from de-

excitation of a 85Rb metastable state with 1.015µs half-life [5]. Analysis of the

data saw no such events, and set a 90% conﬁdence upper limit of < 0.26 mDRU,

or < 5.4 ppt Kr content. If we assume the 3.5 ppt krypton concentration from

the assay above, the number can be interpreted as an upper limit of 31 ppt

85Kr/Kr ratio in the atmosphere, consistent with the expected upper limit of

atmospheric concentration of 20 ppt.

Conclusion

An adsorption-based gas-charcoal chromatographic system was built at the

Case Western Reserve University and used to reduce the krypton concentration

in the LUX target xenon. The processed xenon contained 3.5 ppt of krypton,

surpassing the LUX goal. The average reduction factor was 3 × 104, and about

the same reduction was achieved from a single pass. The best batch from the

double-production contained less than 0.2 ppt, the measurement sensitivity. The

chromatography system was capable of processing and storing 50 kg of xenon a

week with minimal human intervention. The processed xenon has been used for

the scientiﬁc runs of the LUX experiment [2].

A krypton removal system that can produce lower krypton levels with higher

production rate is required for larger xenon-based dark matter experiments such

as the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment. LZ is a scaled-up successor to LUX,

planned to operate in 2020 [32]. It is designed to reach a WIMP-nucleon cross

section sensitivity of 2 × 10−48 cm2 with 7 tonnes of active xenon mass from

a 10-tonnes total xenon mass. An irreducible electron-recoil background is set

by elastic scattering of solar pp neutrinos, whose rate is comparable to 0.2 ppt

krypton dissolved in xenon. The LZ collaboration aims to reduce its krypton

concentration below 0.015 ppt. Further investigations are ongoing to determine

the ultimate ﬂoor that can be reached by improving the design to further re-

duce cross-contamination and air ingress, which can otherwise compromise the

reductions allowed by repeated processing. If the target is met, LZ is expected

to directly measure the scattering of solar pp neutrinos on electrons and co-

herent elastic scattering of 8B neutrinos on nuclei, in addition to substantially

extending the sensitivity to WIMP dark matter interactions.
