Abstract 
Co and CoO thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering in the form of multilayers. 
They  were  irradiated  with  Ar  and  Si  ion  beams  of  different  energies  and  fluences.    The 
magnetic properties were investigated. 

Keywords: Co, CoO, thin films, Ion beam, magnetic properties 

Ion  beam  irradiation  is  an  effective  means  of  studying  the  morphological  changes 

occurring in thin films. Surface energy changes as well as displacement of atoms due 

to  localized  heating  can  bring  about  interesting  phenomena  which  can  lead  to 

possible patterning and device fabrication in the future [1]. Ion beam irradiation was 

performed  previously  on  Co/CoO  films  deposited  on  Si  (111)  substrates  by 

magnetron sputtering. Ion-beam-induced dewetting and exchange bias was observed 

[2]. This communication is an extension of the previous work [2].

Thickness of each film was 25 nm. The films were then irradiated with Si and Ar ions 

at different fluences and energies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and magnetic 

force  microscopy  (MFM)  measurements  were  performed  to  study  the  changes  in 

morphology  and  magnetic  structure  that  occurred  with  the  irradiation  while  SQUID 

and  PPMS  measurements  were  performed  to  study  temperature  and  magnetic  field 

dependence  of  dc  magnetization.  Superparamagnetism  was  observed  for  Si  ion 

irradiated Co films on Si(111) substrates as shown in Fig 1. SEM of the deposited and 

irradiated films are shown in Fig 2. Ion beam induced dewetting as proposed by lian et 

al  can  be  observed  in  fig  2  c.  Grooves  can  be  seen  on  the  surface  which  is  due  to 

enhancement of irregularities at the surface due to preferential etching [3].

Fig 3:  ZFC-FC magnetization curves for Si ion Fluence of 1017  with energy 50 KeV on 

Co/CoO thin films. 

Superparamagnetism  was  observed  for  Co/CoO  films,  which  were 

irradiated  with  200  keV  Ar  ions  at  a  fluence  of  1015  ions/cm2.  Blocking 

temperature  around  300  K  was  obtained  from  the  measured  ZFC-FC 

magnetization curves which has been published elsewhere [3]. An exchange 

bias  was  also  observed  with  variation  Ai  ion  fluence  from  1015  to  1016 

ions/cm2  (Fig  4).  A  Si  ion  Fluence  of  1017  with  energy  50  KeV  however  did  not 

show  any  deviation  in  the  ZFC-FC  magnetization  curves  (Fig  3).Interestingly 

although  an  increase  in  coercivity  and  exchange  bias  was  observed  previously  for 

ion beam irradiated Co/CoO films, a decrease in coercivity was observed in pristine 

Co/Si  with temperature as shown in Fig 3. Effect of temperature on the magnetic 

properties  is  a  complex  area  and  there  are  numerously  results.  In  the  case  of  Ni 

ferrite  nanoparticles,  an  increase  in  coercivity  with  decrease  in  temperature  has 

been  observed  which  was  explained  on  the  basis  of  presence  of  freezed  surface-

spins  and  some  paramagnetic  impurities  at  the  shell  of  nanoparticles  that  are 

activated  at  lower  temperatures  [7].  These  grooves  if  properly  controlled  and 

patterned can act as enhanced optical transmitting zones [8].
