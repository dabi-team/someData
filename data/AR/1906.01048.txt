ABSTRACT
In this study, we present one-dimensional, non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium, radiative
transfer simulations (using CMFGEN) in which we introduce micro-clumping at nebular times
into two Type Ia supernova ejecta models. We use one sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh) ejecta
with 1.02 M(cid:12) and one MCh ejecta model with 1.40 M(cid:12). We introduce clumping factors f =
0.33, 0.25, and 0.10 which are constant throughout the ejecta and compared to the unclumped
f = 1.0 case. We ﬁnd that clumping is a natural mechanism to reduce the ionization of the
ejecta, reducing emission from [Fe III], [Ar III], and [S III] by a factor of a few. For decreasing
values of the clumping factor f , the [Ca II] λλ7291,7324 doublet became a dominant cooling
line for our MCh model but still weak in our sub-MCh model. Strong [Ca II] λλ7291,7324
indicates non-thermal heating in that region and may constrain explosion modelling. Due to
the low abundance of stable nickel, our sub-MCh model never showed the [Ni II] 1.939 micron
diagnostic feature for all clumping values.

INTRODUCTION

The general consensus is that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are ther-
monuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs (WDs)
(Hoyle & Fowler 1960). Whether this explosion is the result of a
system of one WD and a non-degenerate star (known as the single
degenerate (SD) channel) or via a system of two WDs (known as
the double degenerate (DD) channel) remains uncertain.

SNe Ia come from compact WDs and cool quickly via adi-
abatic expansion, and without an additional energy supply, they
would be extremely difﬁcult to detect. What powers the observed
luminosity of SNe Ia is the decay of radioactive material produced
during the explosion. The main radioactive isotope produced is
56Ni, whose decay chain is 56Ni→56Co→56Fe, releasing 1.72 and
3.75 MeV for each part of the decay chain. Therefore, the produc-
tion of 56Ni is important in powering the luminosity of SNe Ia.
However, the nickel yields (both stable and unstable) in SNe Ia are
sensitive to both progenitor mass (ρc) and explosion scenario.

In 1D explosion modelling, higher central densities lead to en-
hanced electron capture and thus a larger neutron excess during
the explosion. As a consequence, more stable nickel (58Ni, 60Ni,
and 62Ni) is produced (Nomoto 1984; Khokhlov 1991a,b). Sub-
MCh WDs have lower central densities, and 1D modelling of SNe
Ia from sub-MCh progenitors shows a lower abundance of 58Ni
and 60Ni compared to MCh SNe Ia. However, 3D DDT modelling

does not produce a 56Ni hole. Instead, the abundance of both 56Ni
and 58Ni extend from the lowest velocities to about 10 000 km s−1
(Kasen et al. 2009; Seitenzahl et al. 2013). This result arises be-
cause ignition occurs in the centre of the WD. If ignition occurs on
the surface, as in a double detonation, the burning front moves in
and there is no mixing of stable Ni outwards (Woosley & Weaver
1994; Livne & Arnett 1995; Fink et al. 2007, 2010). Overall, the 3D
simulations of WD explosions remain somewhat artiﬁcial, and the
outcome depends strongly on number of ignition points and their
distribution. Despite the time-scale for gravitational settling being
∼ 109 − 1010 yrs (Bildsten & Hall 2001), 22Ne settling in sub-MCh
is proposed as a way to enhance the neutronization. Therefore, neb-
ular nickel and IGE spectral features may constrain the physics of
SNe Ia (Woosley 1997; Iwamoto et al. 1999; Stehle et al. 2005;
Mazzali & Podsiadlowski 2006; Gerardy et al. 2007; Maeda et al.
2010a; Mazzali et al. 2011; Mazzali & Hachinger 2012; Mazzali
et al. 2015).

Without knowing the progenitor system and explosion sce-
nario, we fundamentally cannot accurately predict (despite under-
standing ﬂame physics) the amount of stable nickel produced, the
overall abundances of IMEs, nor where in the ejecta these IMEs
are produced relative to the 56Ni. However, studying nebular spec-
tra will allow us to estimate these properties. At nebular times any
nickel emission features are due to the remaining stable nickel, par-
ticularly from 58Ni and 60Ni. Since the width of any observed neb-
ular feature is inﬂuenced by emission over the velocities at which
the species exist, stable nickel features may help constrain the pres-
ence of the 56Ni hole (irrespective of the model).

Nebular spectra are great tools to understand progenitors of
SNe Ia. At this time, the ejecta is optically thin to continuum and
most lines (with exceptions such as UV transitions), and much
of the spectra comes from the inner part of the ejecta ((cid:46) 8000
km s−1), where the densities are highest and iron is the most abun-
dant species. Because iron is most abundant in this region at nebu-
lar times, optical spectra are dominated by Fe II and Fe III lines and
exhibit little to no ﬂux from IME species such as S III and Ar III.
The [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 may be blended with the [Fe II] λλ7155,
7172, 7388 triplet, so its presence is difﬁcult to determine.

Numerous previous studies have investigated SN Ia nebu-
lar spectra (Houck & Fransson 1992; Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 1992,
1995; Smareglia & Mazzali 1997; Mazzali et al. 1998; Gerardy
2002; Kozma et al. 2005; Maeda et al. 2010b; Blondin et al. 2012;
Taubenberger et al. 2013b; Mazzali et al. 2015; Black et al. 2016;
Botyánszki & Kasen 2017; Graham et al. 2017; Maguire et al.
2018; Black 2018; Diamond et al. 2018; Black et al. 2018). Authors
often study emission lines by ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles to features
that may or may not be blended. Maguire et al. (2018), for instance,
ﬁt Gaussian proﬁles to emission lines, and assumes the levels are in
LTE with respect to the ground state. These authors also try and ﬁt
the complicated feature around 7300 Å without knowing the pos-
sible contribution from [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324. Work by Tauben-
berger et al. (2013b) utilised nebular spectra to understand the
emission from [O I] λλ6300, 6364 in the subluminous SN2010lp
(SN1991bg-like). These authors argued for a non-spherical distri-
bution of oxygen located close to the core to produce these features.

Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (1995) struggled to obtain good model
ﬁts to nebular spectra despite their models matching the photo-
spheric phase spectra. These authors also note the dominant form
of iron is Fe2+, with a sizeable fraction of Fe+ that need not be co-
incident with Fe2+. Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (1992) modelled spectra
for distance determination by solving for the ionization structure,
assuming collisional excitations dominate, and the energy loss is
balanced by the thermalization of γ-rays and positrons from nu-
clear decays. These authors were able to ﬁt some features (like the
[Fe III] 4700 Å blend) to nebular spectra. Mazzali et al. (2015) also
obtained good nebular spectral ﬁts to SN2011fe with their ‘ρ-11fe’
model by means of abundance tomography. The authors claim that
SN2011fe requires the innermost ejecta to be dominated by stable
iron, which aids in cooling instead of heating (via radioactive de-
cay) and rules out a low mass (∼1.02 M(cid:12)) WD progenitor. Mazzali
et al. (2018) also used abundance tomography to model the fast
declining SNe Ia, SN2007bo and SN2011iv. By analyzing emis-
sion components of many [Fe II] and [Fe III] features, the authors
reproduce the spectra by using a two component emission model
(one blueshifted and one redshifted), which acts like two distinct
nebulae. The authors do not rule out the possibility of an off-centre
ignition instead of two colliding WDs. In all of these works, how-
ever, the abundances and their distributions are free parameters.

Nebular modelling raises questions about

the ioniza-
tion/abundance structure of “normal" SN Ia ejecta. Nebular mod-
elling by Botyánszki & Kasen (2017) and Wilk et al. (2018) pre-
dicts strong emission lines of [S III] λλ9069, 9531 (and [Ar III]
λ71336, 7751 by Wilk et al. (2018)) in their ejecta mass mod-
els. Why are these emission lines largely absent or weak in ob-
servations? What is the contribution of [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 to
the observed 7300 Å feature? What does it imply if IMEs are not
seen in nebular spectra? Does this reﬂect the ionization structure
or the abundances and/or chemical stratiﬁcation? What causes the
strength of the [Fe III] 4700 Å feature to be much stronger than

other features beyond 5500 Å in models compared to observations
(Botyánszki & Kasen 2017; Wilk et al. 2018)?

The nebular model spectra of Wilk et al. (2018) indicate a
higher ionization than what is generally observed. As clumping en-
hances the density, increases the recombination rate, and lowers the
ionization, we introduce clumping in our nebular modelling of SNe
Ia ejecta. Given the high ionization of model SUB1 (a sub-MCh det-
onation ejecta model from Wilk et al. (2018) – also see Section 2)
at nebular times (because the lack of a “56Ni hole” facilitates more
heating of the inner region), clumping is a natural choice given pre-
vious evidence of its role in reproducing spectral features (Chugai
1992; Bowers et al. 1997; Thomas et al. 2002; Leonard et al. 2005;
Leloudas et al. 2009; Srivastav et al. 2016; Porter et al. 2016). Pre-
vious theoretical modelling suggests clumping to be a byproduct of
“nickel bubbles," an expansion of the iron and nickel regions rela-
tive to the surrounding material due to radioactive decay energy de-
position (Woosley 1988; Li et al. 1993; Basko 1994; Wang 2008),
Rayleigh Taylor instabilities during DDT burning (Golombek &
Niemeyer 2005), or material interaction during detonation (Maier
& Niemeyer 2006).

In this Section, we study the formation of nebular spectra and
examine the inﬂuence of clumping. We highlight problems with
the emission from IMEs and the ionization structure by examin-
ing the inﬂuence of clumping. In this study, we use models SUB1
and CHAN from Wilk et al. (2018). In section 2 we discuss our
technique for introducing clumping in our models. In section 3 we
present the impact of clumping on nebular SN Ia spectra. We high-
light the changes to the ionization structure in section 3.2. Shifts
in ionization are reﬂected in some species, so in sections 3.3, 3.4,
and 3.5 we discuss the effects on iron features, nickel features, and
IMEs respectively. Finally, we summarize our work in section 4.

2 TECHNIQUE

2.1 Ejecta Models

This research uses two hydrodynamic models of Wilk et al. (2018),
DDC10 (CHAN) and SCH5p5 (SUB1). DDC10 is a MCh (1.40
M(cid:12)) model from Blondin et al. (2013). Model SCH5p5 is a sub-
MCh (1.04 M(cid:12)) from Blondin et al. (2017), but we have scaled the
density by 0.98 (see Wilk et al. 2018) in order to have the same
56Ni. Both CHAN and SUB1 have the same 56Ni at 0.62 M(cid:12). We
use CMFGEN to solve the spherically symmetric, time-dependent,
relativistic radiative transfer equation allowing for non-local ther-
modynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) processes. We take these two
models at 216.5 days post-explosion from Wilk et al. (2018). Ta-
ble 1 lists the initial masses for each model as well as the mass
abundance of calcium, iron, cobalt, 58Ni plus 60Ni, and 56Ni. We
see CHAN has more than twice the amount of stable nickel –
M(58Ni) + M(60Ni) – than SUB1 as well as almost a factor of two
more calcium.

2.2 Numerical Treatment

Our original radiative-transfer calculations for our models did not
include the effects of clumping. Therefore, to treat clumping in our
models, we make some simple assumptions with CMFGEN. We as-
sume there is no inter-clump media and the clumping is uniform
in a homogeneous ﬂow (i.e. f (V) = fo for all species and veloc-
ities V). Assumptions underlying our clumping approach and dis-
cussions of the inﬂuence of clumping on core-collapse SNe II-P

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)

are provided by Dessart et al. (2018). Our treatment of clumping
in CMFGEN differs from that of a concentric shell-type structure,
which is susceptible to radiative transfer effects across a shell and
requires a large number of depth points to resolve the shells.

The clumping factor scales many variables, such as densities
(scaled by 1/ f ) and the emissivities and opacities (calculated using
populations derived from clumps then scaled by f ). This micro-
clumping formalism leaves the mass column density unchanged.
CMFGEN has incorporated this clumping method since Hillier &
Miller (1999) ﬁrst applied it to massive stars.

At a time step of 216.5 d post explosion (∼+200 d post max-
imum) we resolved the relativistic radiative transfer equation for
our models SUB1 and CHAN using a clumping factor ( f ) of 0.33,
0.25, and 0.1 (a value motivated by modelling of Wolf-Rayet stars
(Hillier & Miller 1999)). Since the previous time-step was not com-
puted using clumping in the models, we scaled the initial input pop-
ulations by 1/ f between successive ionizations. This simple scaling
is adequate since time-dependent effects have a negligible inﬂuence
on the spectrum.

3 RESULTS

Figs. 1 and 2 show the synthetic optical and near infrared (NIR)
spectra of SUB1 and CHAN for the different values of a clumping
factor ( f = 1.00, 0.33, 0.25, and 0.10). In order to contrast the little
amount of ﬂux in the NIR, we show log Fλ vs. λ for wavelengths
1.0–2.4 µm. We also show the component spectrum for f = 0.10
and f = 0.33 for models SUB1 and CHAN in Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6.

3.1 Unclumped Models

Before we discuss clumping, it is necessary to understand and sum-
marize the results of Wilk et al. (2018) that do not incorporate
clumping. This Section focuses on two ejecta models, a direct det-
onation of a sub-MCh WD and a DDT WD explosion model. Be-
cause our models come from two different explosion scenarios, the
nucleosynthesis yields and stratiﬁcation are model dependent. In
1D simulations of DDT explosions in MCh WDs produce what
is known as a “56Ni hole," which is an underabundance of 56Ni
in the innermost region. This arises due to neutron-rich nuclear
statistical equilibrium (NSE) burning. Since our SUB1 model has
lower central densities during explosion, it does not have a “56Ni
hole." Therefore, SUB1 has a factor of about 2.26 less stable nickel.
Within the “56Ni hole” of CHAN, the temperature and ionization
is lower than in the region containing the original 56Ni.

Since stable nickel is centralized to the innermost part of the
ejecta, it only becomes visible as the photosphere recedes inwards
and the ejecta becomes optically thin. Hence, the ejecta transitions
into the nebular phase. Thus, nebular spectra allow us to probe this
once shielded inner region. At 216 days post explosion (roughly
+200 days post maximum), we do not see stable nickel in our SUB1
model, unlike in model CHAN. SUB1 has very little stable nickel
in the inner region and also has Ni2+ as its dominant ionization
(see ﬁg. 7 of Wilk et al. (2018)). At nebular times we expect to see
forbidden [Ni II] lines, particularly [Ni II] λλ7378, 7412 and [Ni II]
1.939 µm, which are present in CHAN. Both models show strong
emission from higher ionization states like Fe2+, Co2+, Ar2+, and
S2+.

At nebular times, the energy deposited by radioactive decay is
equal to the energy radiated by the gas by numerous cooling lines.
In the models, radioactive decay heats both the IGEs as well as the

IMEs. However, it is necessary to determine if these ejecta mod-
els will still show spectral signatures of IMEs when clumping is
introduced.

3.2 Ionization Shifts

We show the average charge per species for sulfur, argon, calcium,
iron, cobalt, and nickel for models with different amounts of clump-
ing in Figs. 7 and 8. As expected, clumping shifts the ionization
downward in both models for the IGEs from mostly doubly ionized
to singly ionized (i.e. Fe2+→Fe+). The strength of Fe III, Co III,
Ni III, S III, and Ar III lines decreases considerably with increasing
clumping, while Fe II and Co II lines increase. For both SUB1 and
CHAN, the average charge of sulfur, argon, and cobalt differs by
almost one electron between f = 1.00 and f = 0.10 in the inner
ejecta regions.

3.3 Impact on Iron Lines

Figs. 1 and 2, show that the Fe I, Fe II, and Fe III optical features
changed signiﬁcantly. The [Fe III] λλ4658, 4702 feature dropped
in ﬂux by more than a factor of two in both ejecta models from
f = 1.00 to f = 0.10, while we saw the emergence of Fe I features
J – a 5FJ(cid:48)
between 4100–4500 Å and between 5400–5600 Å (z 5Do
optical transitions). Figs. 1 and 2 show the Fe I emission as a shoul-
der to the neighboring [Fe III] and [Fe II] emission for f =0.33 and
0.25, while we see a noticeable peak for f = 0.10.

While Fe II features were generally enhanced, the expected
Fe II feature around 4359 Å (believed to be the a6S5/2 – a6D7/2
transition and similarly the a6S5/2 – a6D9/2 transition at 4287 Å)
is weak or absent in our models compared with observations. An
examination of the individual Fe I, Fe II, and Fe III spectra showed
that the optical depth effects are important. It appears that the emer-
gence of partially thick Fe I lines, Ti II lines like 4395 Å, and per-
mitted Fe II lines reduce the strength of the claimed [Fe II] λλ4287,
4359 doublet believed to be seen in nebular spectra.

In Figs. 9, 10, and 11 we show the optical depth to the [Fe II]
λ4359 resonance zone (at velocity V) arising from interactions with
other lines along the line of sight. There are tens of interacting lines
to the outer ejecta and ∼25 000 interacting lines to the inner ejecta.
Figs. 9 and 10 show this optical depth (and the continuum opti-
cal depth) along a core ray through the ejecta. The line transitions
with the largest optical depth contributions are Fe I] λ4384, Fe I]
λ4375, Ti II λ4395, Fe II λ4385, and Fe I] λ4404. Differences be-
tween models and levels of clumping reﬂect the differences in the
ionization of iron since the largest contributions to the optical depth
primarily come from iron lines. Fig. 11 shows this optical depth
along various rays parallel to the z-axis towards the observer (Vy
and Vz ). In both models, [Fe II] λ4359 reaches an optical depth of
unity at roughly 10 000 km s−1 for a clumping factor of 0.10. In
model CHAN, the Sobolev line optical depth reaches unity around
5 000 km s−1 for f = 0.33, while for model SUB1 it is true around
2500 km s−1. Figs. 1 and 2 highlight how little ﬂux is seen below
4500 Å.

Studies of SN Ia nebular spectra often investigate the [Fe II]
feature around 12 600 Å (Maguire et al. 2018; Diamond et al. 2018)
since it is the least blended feature in nebular SN Ia spectra (free
from other lines and ionization states of Fe). Our models conﬁrm
it is “blend”-free. This line complex is therefore the best feature
to constrain the Fe II emitting region. We show in Fig. 12 that this

4

[Fe II] feature can be reproduced by calculating an emission spec-
trum. To produce this emission spectrum, we use the temperature
and ionization structure from CMFGEN and re-solve the level popu-
lations considering only collisional processes and radiative decays.
The relativistic radiative transfer equation is then solved assuming
zero opacity. We show this line complex can be inferred from to-
mography, as it is only sensitive to the temperature and ionization.
However, this method will break down for departures from spheri-
cal symmetry.

Various observations of nebular SN Ia spectra show a slight
shouldering on the 4600 Å iron complex due to a potential Fe I fea-
J – a 5FJ(cid:48) optical transitions – (Childress
ture at 5500 Å – z 5Do
et al. 2015; Graham et al. 2017). Such Fe I features could constrain
the level of ionization within SN ejecta and assist future modelling.
Since Fe I features cause optical depth effects with [Fe II] λ4287,
4359, it is important to determine the Fe ionization. Despite all
the observations showing [Fe II] λ4287, 4359, this feature has yet
to be accurately modelled by other researchers (Spyromilio 2016,
private communication; Sim 2016, private communication). Shifts
in the ionization of iron (Fe2+ → Fe+ → Fe) are expected as the
ejecta continuously expands and cools as less energy is deposited
from radioactive decays (Fransson & Jerkstrand 2015). Fransson
& Jerkstrand (2015) showed that at very late times (1000 days),
the 4600 Å iron complex, despite its similar appearance to early
epochs, is dominated by emission from Fe I and Fe II.

[Ni II] 1.939 microns

3.4
In SUB1 models, the ionization fraction for nickel (Ni+/ Ni2+)
drops in the inner region ((cid:46) 5000 km s−1) by roughly three or-
ders of magnitude when changing f = 1.00 to f = 0.10. However,
the [Ni II] 1.939 µm line is still absent in SUB1. Where the line for-
mation occurs, below ∼6500 km s−1, the electron density is higher
than 107 cm−3 in the inner part of the ejecta, so its line emission
scales linearly with density as we increase the amount of clumping.
These densities are above the critical density for the upper level of
this transition, so collisional de-excitations are important.

With f = 0.10 for SUB1, the weak [Ni II] 1.939 micron line
is also a factor of a few weaker than [Co II] 1.9035 microns. SUB1
has more than a factor of 2 less stable nickel compared to CHAN
(Table 1) in which we do still see the [Ni II] 1.939 micron line. With
all of these factors such as ionization and abundance accounted for,
it is not surprising that spectra of SUB1 still do not show this line.

3.5

IMEs

Due to the overlap in production/mixing of 56Ni and IMEs in our
models, the strengths of IMEs are sensitive to the non-thermal heat-
ing and ionization structure within the ejecta. Within our mod-
els, a consequence of clumping is the enhancement of the [Ca II]
λλ7291, 7324 doublet. The [Ca II] doublet is blended with the
[Fe II] λλ7155, 7172, 7388 triplet and [Ar III] λ7136, and it con-
tributes a large portion of the ﬂux to the blended feature (see
Figs. 3-6). The [Ca II] emission ﬂux is model dependent. Not only
is the mass of calcium ∼1.75 times larger in CHAN than SUB1 but
also the distribution of calcium varies signiﬁcantly between SUB1
and CHAN. In SUB1, the inner region containing 80 percent of
the energy deposited only contains 25 percent of the calcium mass.
In CHAN, however, the inner region containing 80 percent of the
energy deposited contains 50 percent of the calcium mass. These
models help constrain the amount of stratiﬁcation between the orig-
inal 56Ni and IMEs required to produce SNe Ia nebular spectra.

Once the ionization is lowered, Ca+ becomes the dominant
cooling for the zone rich in IMEs, since S+ and Ar+, unlike their
twice-ionized siblings, do not have strong cooling lines due to their
low critical densities. We see the strength in the twice-ionized sul-
fur and argon lines ([S III] λλ9068, 9530 and [Ar III] λλ7135,
7751) decreases as we lower the clumping factor. However, it is
unclear if such strong [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 emission is seen in
spectra of classic SNe Ia blended into the feature around 7200 Å,
which is thought to be mostly [Fe II] and [Ni II], in nebular spectra
– Taubenberger et al. (2013a); Bikmaev et al. (2015); Graham et al.
(2017); Maguire et al. (2018). For low luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia
(such as SN1999by), modelling suggests Ca emission is the domi-
nant component of the 7200 Å feature at +180 days (Blondin et al.
2018).

If the 7200 Å feature is highly blended with [Ca II], then for a
given electron density and temperature, we can predict emissivity
per ion ratio of the [Ca II] doublet to the [Fe II] lines using some
simple physical assumptions. Assuming only collisional processes
and radiative decays, we can solve for the atomic level populations
for a range of temperatures and electron densities. Fig. 14 shows
the emissivity ratio of the [Ca II] λ7291 transition to the [Fe II]
λ7155 transition for a range of temperatures and electron densi-
ties with our simple assumptions. As shown in Fig. 14, for equal
N(Fe+)/N(Ca+) = 1, the emissivity ratio between [Ca II] λ7291
and [Fe II] λ7155 for temperatures between 2000-7000 K and elec-
tron densities between 105-108 cm−3 is between a factor of 10-100.
However, in our models, our N(Fe+)/N(Ca+) is ∼5-30 between
5 000-10 000 km s−1. Therefore, we expect to see [Ca II] λλ7291,
7324 emission blended as long as the N(Fe+)/N(Ca+) is (cid:46) 100.
Although this only relates to the stronger component of the [Ca II]
doublet, the [Ca II] λ7324 line comprises roughly 40 percent of the

blended components will contribute much less ﬂux as the Einstein
A values are a factor of 2-3 less than the [Fe II] λ7155 transition.
Despite the level excitation energy of Ca+ 2D5/2 and Fe+

where Z is the partition function. For temperatures of 2000, 5000,
and 10 000 K, the partition function (using the ﬁrst 18 levels) is
approximately 28, 43, and 58 respectively assuming the states are
in LTE with respect to the ground state. Since Fe+ has many easily
excited lower levels, then even for the same ion abundance between
Ca+ and Fe+, the emission from Ca II will dominate the blended
feature at 7200 Å.

The strong emission of the [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 doublet is
not only a result of the ionization, temperature, and electron den-
sity but also coupled to the radiation ﬁeld. The Ca II H&K lines
have large oscillator strengths and can pump electrons into the up-
per 2Po levels. They then decay to the 2D state, which again decays
to the 2S ground state giving us [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 emission. We
have taken our ionization, temperature, and electron density struc-
ture from CMFGEN and re-solved for the level populations of Ca+
assuming only collisional and radiative decay processes. For levels
that are coupled to UV transitions, this assumption is only accurate
within 50%. We then solved the relativistic radiative transfer equa-

attempts to model the [Fe II] λλ4287, 4359 feature were unsuc-
cessful. While clumping generally enhanced the strength of [Fe II]
features, absorption by other transitions limit its strength. Despite
the difﬁculty in reproducing [Fe II] λλ4287, 4359, we show that
the [Fe II] complex around 12500 Å is completely reproduced un-
der simple physics assumptions of collisional and radiative decays
from a given ionization and temperature structure. In the IR, par-
ticularly from 10 000-11 800 Å, changes in the ﬂux of Fe I lines of
several orders of magnitude for a factor of a few change in density.
For the same 56Ni mass, MCh explosions produce more IMEs
compared to sub-MCh explosions. We have seen that only large
clumping can sufﬁciently suppress emission from IMEs such as
Ar III and S III. However, as we increase clumping, both mod-
els show an increase in the [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324, which domi-
nates over the [Fe II] λ7155 feature. Since the presence/absence
of [Ca II] in this 7200 Å blend is still highly uncertain, we suggest
that SN Ia ejecta require less mixing between the original 56Ni and
the calcium distribution. Another possibility is that the Ni and Ca
are not microscopically mixed. In that case non-thermal energy de-
posited in the Fe region would be radiated by Fe, while the energy
deposited in the IME region would be radiated primarily by IMEs.
In this case the strength of the [Ca II] lines relative to [Fe II] would
be set by the amount of heating in each region.

Despite arguments that mixing is required to reproduce early-
time LCs, mixing between layers of IMEs and 56Ni is inconsis-
tent with what is observed at nebular times, since the emission re-
ﬂects where most of the energy is deposited. The strength of time-
dependent IME features in nebular spectra is a crucial diagnostic
for understanding both progenitors and explosion properties of SNe
Ia.

Better atomic data can also assist determining the sensitivity
it has on the Fe I/Fe II/Fe III features in producing nebular spectra.
Because the focus of this work is on nebular phase modelling, fur-
ther work is necessary to test the time-dependent effects of various
levels of clumping. It would be helpful to perform full time-series
calculations. Clumping should be fully explored to truly understand
the nature of the progenitors of SNe Ia.

tion for line emission of Ca II with zero opacity. Our results (see
Fig. 12) show the spectra of Ca II is sensitive to the radiation ﬁeld.
Flux is absorbed in the Ca II H&K lines which can then be emitted
in the Ca II NIR triplet as well as the [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 doublet.
Despite the critical densities for Ca+ 2D3/2 and 2D5/2 being on the
order of ∼ 105 − 106 cm−3, the atomic levels above the Ca+ 2D3/2
and 2D5/2 have sufﬁciently high critical densities which inhibits
collisional de-excitations locking these levels to their LTE value.

Such strong [Ca II] emission could indicate a problem with
our atomic data for Fe I/Fe II or likely be an indication of more
stratiﬁed material in our 1D models. Element stratiﬁcation within
the ejecta also inﬂuences the strength of the lines belonging to
IMEs. In particular, the presence of some 56Co in the IME zone
means that positrons are available as a heating source after the
ejecta has become optically thin to γ-ray photons. However, even
at late times, this contributes only a fraction of non-thermal heating
in the inner region. γ-rays still scatter out into the ejecta, heating
some of the outer layers.

If the problem lies not with our atomic data, then stratiﬁcation
is the cause of strong IME emission. This puts a constraint on the
nucleosynthetic distribution of calcium produced in SNe Ia. This
either prohibits an overlap between the calcium and the radioactive
isotopes like 56Ni, or this constrains the mass of calcium produced
during the nucleosynthesis. Not surprisingly, when we artiﬁcially
scaled down the mass of calcium by a factor of 2 in our CHAN
f = 0.25 clumped model, the peak ﬂux drops by half. This also has
implications for understanding the early-time light curves. In order
to produce the blue colors of SNe Ia, studies routinely mix 56Ni
into the outer layers of the ejecta in DDT models.

4 CONCLUSION

We have performed 1D radiative transfer calculations using CMF-
GEN for two ejecta models (one sub-MCh detonation and one MCh
DDT – see Wilk et al. (2018) for more details) utilizing micro-
clumping at 216.5 days post explosion. Our goal was to understand
the inﬂuence of micro-clumping on nebular spectra and to test when
clumped models would provide a better ﬁt to the observed level of
ionization in Ia spectra. Clumping is expected to occur naturally
in SN ejecta and naturally reduces the ionization by enhancing re-
combination. We considered three different clumping factors, 0.33,
0.25, and 0.10, which we assumed were constant throughout the
ejecta. Our models are in a regime where potentially small changes
can shift the ionization. This also means that our models are sensi-
tive to atomic physics.

Clumping lowers the average ionization of all species. The av-
erage ionization of IMEs is reduced by about one electron below
10 000 km s−1 and roughly one half of an electron for IGEs (except
cobalt which is reduced by roughly an electron). Despite clumping
lowering the ionization in SUB1, the nickel ionization remained
high in the inner region due to a lack of a “56Ni hole.” With an al-
ready reduced stable nickel mass compared to CHAN, SUB1 failed
to show strong emission from Ni II in the optical and in the NIR
with the [Ni II] 1.939 µm line.

As iron is the most abundant species in the inner ejecta at 216
days, clumping had the most visible effect on the ﬂux of [Fe III]
features such as [Fe III] λλ4658, 4702. As the iron ionization is
lowered, the ﬂux in Fe II features increases, and permitted Fe I lines
near 5500 Å emerged. These Fe I lines cause a shoulder to form on
the [Fe II] and [Fe III] optical blend between 4200-5400 Å. Our

Figure 7. Model SUB1 average charge on species for sulfur, argon, calcium, iron, cobalt, and nickel for clumping factors of 1.00, 0.33, 0.25, and 0.10 at roughly +200 d after maximum. The ionization is largely
sensitive to the clumping factor and the non-thermal energy deposition in the inner ejecta. Sulfur and argon show changes of roughly one electron, while iron shifts from mostly Fe2+ to nearly equal parts Fe2+ and
Fe+. The majority of the stable nickel is located in the inner ejecta, and in this region the ionization is driven by the radioactive decay deposition. These changes in the inner region relate to large changes on the
spectra.

Figure 12. Observer’s frame emission spectra of Fe II, Fe III, Ni II, Co II, Co III, and Ca II. We show the full observer’s frame spectrum in black. The emission
spectra are calculated by taking the temperature and ionization structure output from CMFGEN and re-solving the level populations assuming only collisional
processes and radiative decays. We assume Gaussian emission proﬁles of 100 km s−1 in the CMF.

Figure 13. Left plot is the mass fractions for calcium and iron in both models. The solid line corresponds to model CHAN, and the dashed line corresponds
to SUB1. The right plot is the cumulative distribution function for the energy deposition (solid lines) and the calcium mass (dashed lines) at 217 days after
explosion (roughly +200 days).

Figure 14. Line emission ratio of the [Ca II] λ7291 to [Fe II] λ7155 assum-
ing N(Fe+)/N(Ca+)=1. The emission ratio is calculated by solving the rate
equations with only collisional and radiative decay terms for a ﬁxed ioniza-
tion of N(Fe+)/N(Ca+)=1. The emission ratio favors strong calcium. When
this ionization ratio is (cid:38)50 the iron would begin to dominate the 7200 Å
complex.
