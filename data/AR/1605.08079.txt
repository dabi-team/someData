In the present work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes were decorated with rhodium nanoparticles using a colloidal 
solution in the post-discharge of an RF atmospheric plasma of argon (Ar) or argon/oxygen (Ar:O2). The properties of 
these  hybrid  materials  towards  the  room  temperature  detection  of  NO2,  C2H4,  CO,  C6H6  and  moisture  were 
investigated and discussed in view of compositional and morphological studies. It was found that the presence of 
oxygen in the plasma treatment is essential to significantly enhance the gas response of Rh-decorated multiwalled 
carbon nanotubes and to avoid response saturation even at low gas/vapor concentrations. These desirable effects 
are attributed to the presence of oxygen during the CNT plasma treatment since oxygenated vacancies act both as 
active adsorption sites for gases and as anchoring sites for  Rh nanoparticles (the presence of Rh nanoclusters is 
nearly doubled in Ar:O2 treated samples as compared to Ar treated samples). The oxygen treatment also makes 
easier the charge transfer between Rh nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes upon gas adsorption. The method for 
treating  and  decorating  multiwalled  carbon  nanotubes  used  here  is  simple,  fast  and  scalable  for  producing  gas 
sensitive nanohybrid materials with uniform and well-controlled properties. 

1. Introduction 

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have  been widely  studied in  different applications of nanotechnology  thanks to their  interesting  physico-

chemical properties [1–3]. Taking into account their chemical stability and large surface area to volume ratio, CNTs have been considered 

as new supports for metal catalysts [4,5]. Since the adsorption of a small quantity of chemical species can result in a dramatic change 

of their conductivity, CNTs are suited to detect gases at low concentrations (e.g.  low ppb level) [6]. Furthermore, the possibility to 

operate CNT gas sensors at room temperature makes them very interesting to integrate low power consumption detectors [7]. A gas 

sensor can be built using a simple transducer (comb electrodes) to monitor the electrical resistance of a CNT-based film. 

In recent years, numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been focused on the functionalization of CNT surface and/or the 

decoration of their sidewalls with metal nanoclusters, in a quest for enhancing sensitivity and ameliorating selectivity to different toxic 

gases or vapors [7–13]. The modification of CNT surfaces with metal nanoparticles is of interest for gas sensing since metal nanoclusters 

have a broad range of diverse structures and can provide a wide range of reactivity with different species. Indeed, the concept of using 

CNT–metal cluster hybrids as the sensitive material of a device where the metal cluster surfaces act as reactive sites for the adsorption 

of the target molecules was theoretically introduced in [11]. The first researchers that experimentally exploited this concept were Kong 

et al. [8], Kumar and Ramaprabhu [12] and Star et al. [13], who used Pd-decorated CNTs or Pt decorated CNTs to detect hydrogen, and 

an array of single wall CNTs decorated with different metals (Rh, Ni, Au, Pd, etc.) for detecting H2S, CH4, H2, CO and NH3, respectively. 

Recently [7], we have shown the selective detection of low C6H6 concentrations employing an array of Rh, Ni, Au, and Pd decorated 

multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) gas sensors operated at room temperature.

Among the different metals one can consider for decorating carbon nanotube sidewalls, rhodium is of interest since the Rh-MWCNT 

catalyst has been reported to be effective in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings at room temperature. In addition, the catalyst can be 

reused at least six times without losing catalytic activity for arene hydrogenation and its catalytic activity is much higher than that from 

commercially available Rh nanocatalysts [14,15]. Although there is a weak interaction between molecular benzene and CNTs [16], the 

presence of Rh nanoparticles on the surface of MWCNTs helps enhancing the sensor signal upon benzene adsorption (i.e., among the 

different metals studied, Rh led to the highest benzene response) [7]. 

In  this  paper,  the  effects  of  using  two  different  atmospheric  plasmas  (i.e.,  Ar  or  an  Ar–O2  mixture)  while  preparing  Rh  decorated 

multiwall carbon nanotubes on the sensing properties of the resulting nanohybrid materials are studied. The performance of gas sensors 

employing such materials are compared in terms of their response towards NO2, CO, C2H4, C6H6 and moisture. The differences in their 

response are discussed in view of the data gathered by Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy 

(XPS) analyses. Combined, the gas sensing, compositional and morphological studies give insight about the role of oxygen species grafted 

to CNTs during the plasma treatment both for ameliorating the decoration with metal nanoparticles and enhancing the gas response of 

the resulting nanohybrid material. 

2. Experimental 

2.1. Hybrid nanomaterials: synthesis and characterization 

The multiwall carbon nanotubes used were provided by Nanocyl S.A. They were grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition with purity higher 

than 95%. Nanotubes were up to 50 m in length and their outer and inner diameters ranged from 3 to 15 nm and 3 to 7 nm, respectively. 

These nanotubes were decorated with Rh nanoparticles employing a colloid solution supplied by the Department of Chemistry from the 

University of California at Berkeley (USA).  For this solution the capping agent was  poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and the  solvent  was 

ethanol. Solution concentration was 4 mmol/L, which represented 0.31 g L−1 of Rh. The size of Rh nanoparticles was 8.8±1.7 nm [17]. 

The plasma activation and deposition processes are further explained in [18,19]. At first, the experimental process required the cleaning 

of carbon nanotubes for 15 min in a methanol solution. Surface treatment and metal decoration were conducted using  plasma post-

discharge at atmospheric pressure. The plasma was generated with a RF torch (Atomflo-250, from Surfx Technologies LLC), powered at 

80 W and working for an argon flow of 30 L/min. For some of the samples prepared, oxygen was mixed to the argon gas at the rate of 

20 mL/min. Carbon nanotubes, placed 10 mm away from the RF torch were exposed to the plasma post-discharge for 2 min to activate 

their surface. Then, during 30 s, the rhodium colloid solution was sprayed in the plasma post-discharge. Treated nanotubes had to be 

exposed 3 more minutes before switching off the RF torch. As a final step, they were introduced for 5 min into a methanol solution 

under ultrasonication. 

The  chemical  composition  and  the  surface  morphology  of  the  different  hybrid  materials  employed  as  active  layers  of  the  sensors 

fabricated were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron  microscopy (TEM), respectively.  The 

results of these chemical and morphological studies can be found in [18].

2.2. Sensor fabrication and characterization 

Sensor substrates consisted of an integrated array of four inert micro-hotplate substrates, each one comprising a polysilicon heating 

resistor sandwiched between two thin silicon nitride layers and a pair of interdigitated Pt electrodes on top (the electrode gap was 50 

µm).  The  membrane  thickness  was  about  0.6  µm  and  the  active  (hot)  area  of  500  µm×500  µm  [20].  Plasma-treated  Rh-decorated 

MWCNT  were  dispersed  in  dimethyl  formamide  (DMF)  by  ultrasonication  at  room  temperature  to  form  uniform  suspensions.  The 

suspensions  were  airbrushed  onto  the  interdigitated  electrodes.  After  DMF  evaporated  (sensors  are  kept  on  a  hotplate  during  the 

airbrushing process), a mat of metal decorated CNTs spanned across neighboring fingers. By carefully controlling its process parameters 

(e.g., nozzle to substrate distance, substrate temperature, carrier flow and amount of CNTs within a suspension), highly reproducible 

mats  of  Rh-decorated  CNTs  are  obtained.  Finally,  sensors  were  annealed  at  250°C  for  4  h  in  an  air  flow  to  completely  remove  the 

remnant DMF and improve the nanotube-electrode contact. 

The gas sensing properties at room temperature of Rh-decorated carbon nanotubes treated in Ar or Ar+O2 plasmas were tested in the 

presence of NO2, C2H4, CO, and C6H6. Humidity response was also investigated. To perform the measurements, the gas sensors were 

placed in a 2×10−5m3 volume Teflon/stainless steel test chamber. The desired concentrations of each species were obtained using a 

computer controlled measurement rig that employed mass flow meters and calibrated gas bottles. Dry air was used as carrier gas. R.H. 

in the measurement rig was 10% at 30°C. The concentrations tested were as follows: 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 ppb for benzene vapors; 

50, 100, 500 and 1000 ppb for NO2; 3, 7, 15 and 30 ppm for C2H4; and 2, 5, 10 and 20 ppm for CO. Moisture responses to changes in R.H. 

from 10 to 50%, 50% to 80% and 10% to 80% were measured. Finally, to better study moisture effects on gas response, 

50 and 100 ppb of NO2; 2 and 5 ppm of CO; and 50 and 100 ppb of benzene were measured at 50% R.H. To assess the reproducibility of 

results, each measurement was replicated 4 times. An Agilent 34970A multimeter was used for continuously monitoring the electrical 

resistance of the sensors. DC measurements were performed throughout this study. The measurement process was as follows (identical 

for all species tested): the air flow was set to 100 sccm and kept constant. Data acquisition started 20 min before injecting a continuous 

flow of the desired concentration of a given species into the measurement chamber. 20 min after the injection, the sensors were flushed 

with dry air and their temperature was raised to 150°C for  promoting the cleaning of their surface. 20 min after heating had been 

switched off, a new measurement was performed. 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. Effect of plasma treatment conditions on the nanohybrid materials 

XPS and TEM results show that the introduction of oxygen in the plasma used to treat the surface of CNTs induces the grafting of a 

higher amount of Rh nanoparticles onto CNT sidewalls [18]. XPS confirms that adding 20 mL/min of oxygen to the Ar plasma increases 

the amount of Rh from 1.2% (in wt.%) in Ar treated samples to 2.2% (in wt.%) in Ar-O2 treated samples. Moreover, the oxidation state 

of the grafted Rh remains unchanged. TEM analysis shows that this method preserves the original size of the Rh nanoparticles from the 

colloidal solution. These results can be found elsewhere [18]. Additionally Suarez-Martinez et al. showed in [21] that the inclusion of 

oxygen in an RF plasma treatment grafts oxygen species to the CNT surface, which helps creating nucleation/anchoring sites for metal 

clusters. As a result, more Rh nanoparticles are attached to CNT sidewalls and with more uniform distribution than on pristine tubes or

on tubes treated with Ar plasma only. In [18], it is suggested that the introduction of oxygen during CNT plasma treatment favors the 

decoration with Rh nanoparticles because these are immobilized at oxygenated vacancies present in CNT sidewalls and the capping 

agent of colloidal particles is activated, which helps forming a bridge between C and Rh atoms. Giordano et al. [22] found that the 

oxidation of the outer surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes by nitric acid leads to the formation of carboxylic groups that can be 

used to anchor rhodium carbonyl moieties. Thus, the pretreatment of CNTs in oxygen plasma is very necessary to get a high amount of 

metal  particles  attached  onto  nanotube  surface  with  good  homogeneity  [18],  which  are  of  paramount  importance  for  getting  high 

reactivity to gases of the resulting hybrid material. The amounts of Rh grafted on CNT sidewalls are highly reproducible provided that 

the  plasma  parameters  are  kept  the  same.  Furthermore,  the  functionalization  of  CNT  surface  with  oxygen  species  prior  to  metal 

decoration affects the density of states of valence bands [23] and this improves the exchange of electrons at the interface between 

CNTs and metal nanoparticles, which in this way increases the sensitivity of the material. 

3.2. Gas sensing analysis 

After exposing the sensors based on Rh-CNTs treated in argon or argon/oxygen plasmas to the different gases studied, it was found that 

sensors showed different reactivities depending on the material treatment and the gas detected. Fig. 1 shows the typical responses, at 

room temperature, of our hybrid materials towards NO2, C6H6 and CO. Although sensors can recover their baseline by cleaning them 

with air at room temperature, heating at 150°C speeds up sensor baseline recovery. The slow recovery of baseline resistance at room 

temperature and the effect of heating at 150°C are shown in Fig. 2. This moderate temperature helps desorbing the species adsorbed 

on the surface of the hybrid materials. This is supported by the fact that their response to the different species tested decreases if the 

sensors are operated at 150°C. This effect is confirmed by DFT calculations performed on defective CNTs [24]. Saturation in the response 

is seen for CO concentrations higher than 5 ppm (see Fig. 1e in which if CO concentration is further increased to 10 or 20 ppm, sensor 

resistance variations remain below the noise level). If response time is defined as the time needed to reach 90%  of the steady state 

resistance value after gas concentration is changed stepwise, in Rh-decorated CNT sensors response time is below 10 min for CO, C6H6 

and C2H4 and near 20 min for NO2.

Fig. 2. (a) Response and slow recovery of a Rh-decorated CNT sensor at room temperature and (b) room temperature response and complete baseline 

recovery of a Rh-decorated CNT sensor when heating is applied during the cleaning cycle. 

The subplots in Fig. 3 show the response of the two hybrid materials (i.e., Rh-MWCNT treated in Ar or in Ar:O2 plasmas) towards different 

concentrations of C2H4, CO, NO2 and C6H6. Response is defined as (Rg−Ra)/Ra, where Ra is the sensor resistance in clean air (i.e. baseline 

resistance)  and  Rg  is  the  resistance  in  the  presence  of  a  given  species.  Considering  the  species  measured  (see  Fig.  3a–d),  for  both 

materials and for the different concentrations tested, the absolute value of the response is higher for NO2 followed by C2H4, CO and 

finally C6H6. Rh-MWCNTs treated in argon plasma show a clear saturation effect in their response that appears, in some cases, even at 

the lowest concentrations measured. On the other hand, Rh-MWCNTs treated in argon–oxygen plasma show good linearity in their 

response to NO2 and C6H6. However, for C2H4 and CO their response saturates at 2 and 10 ppm, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows that hybrid materials treated in Ar plasma show lower response to the gases tested than materials treated in Ar:O2 plasma. 

The increase in response achieved by the treatment under an Ar:O2 plasma is due to both the increased amount of Rh nanoparticles 

grafted  to  the  outer  surface  of  CNTs  and  to  the  creation  of  oxygenated  vacancies,  which  can  act  as  active  adsorption  sites  for  gas 

molecules [25]. The early saturation in response experienced with materials treated in argon plasma only could be due to their lower 

coverage with Rh nanoparticles and lower amount of oxygenated defects. The fact that the saturation in response is also observed in 

Ar:O2 plasma treated samples in the particular case of ethylene could be due to the non-suitability of Rh for detecting this species [7]. 

These results determine the dominant interaction mechanism between the gases tested and the metal decorated CNTs. This mechanism 

is the charge transfer between adsorbed gas molecules and CNTs via Rh nanoparticles. This alters the conductivity of the hybrid material. 

The direction of this charge transfer depends on the oxidizing or reducing nature of the gas environment [26]. Recently, Zanolli and co-

workers  published  a  deep  combined  experimental  and  theoretical  study  on  the  sensing  properties  of  Au  decorated  CNTs  towards 

benzene, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide [27]. 

In this study, nitrogen dioxide is predicted to accept electronic charge from the Au-CNT system, which is consistent with the electron 

acceptor character of that molecule. The nature of the charge transfer between NO2 and Au-CNT indicates that holes are injected in the 

metal decorated carbon nanotube strengthening its p-type semiconductor behavior and lowering further the Fermi level of the system. 

This explains the decrease in resistance measured in Au-CNT sensors and also applies to the Rh-MWCNT sensors studied here. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  interactions  of  Au-CNTs  with  benzene  are  so  weak  that  no  significant  charge  transfer  could  be  computed, 

suggesting that Au-CNTs are not suitable for detecting benzene [27]. A metal such as Rh, which shows a stronger interaction than Au 

with CNTs is more suitable for detecting benzene since the detection mechanism relies on the biding of the molecule to the nanoparticle. 

Benzene is well-known to be an electron donor. Upon benzene adsorption on Rh nanoparticles, electrons are injected into the Rh-CNT 

system decreasing the concentration of free carriers (i.e., holes), which explains the increase in resistance measured in  Rh-MWCNT 

samples. 

The adsorption of a CO molecule on Au-CNT results in a small fraction of electron charge transferred towards CO [27]. The interaction 

between CO and Au nanoclusters is quite complex [28] since it strongly depends on the overlap of the 5 and 2* orbitals of the CO 

with the d orbitals of the gold nanoparticle, resulting in a mechanism of electron donation/back-donation (i.e., CO donates electrons 

from its  orbitals to the d orbitals of gold and the filled d orbitals of Au donate electrons back into the empty  orbitals of CO). A 

similar mechanism could explain the decrease in resistance observed for Rh-MWCNT sensors in the presence of CO. 

The operational principle in many ceramic humidity sensors is physisorption of water molecules on an initially chemisorbed hydroxyl 

layer. Water physisorption leads to protonic conduction on the surface, which increases the overall conductance of the sensor [29]. The 

process of physisorption onto a hydroxyl layer cannot explain the present results since Rh-MWCNT sensors decrease their conductance 

when humidity increases. These experimental results are in agreement with those previously reported by Varghese et al. in [30], in 

which DC and AC measurements ruled out water physisorption as the operational principle in MWCNTs. Instead, they suggested that 

water vapor directly interacts with p-type MWCNTs donating electrons into the valence band and thus, decreasing the number of holes. 

Additionally, in a recently published paper [24], Zanolli and co-workers have reported computational studies on the interaction of water

vapor  with  defective  carbon  nanotubes  (e.g.,  CNTs  with  oxygenated  vacancies).  Water  vapor  is  predicted  to  mildly  interact  with 

defective tubes in which a small charge transfer occurs between adsorbed water molecules and CNTs. 

Similar studies should be performed to elucidate the interaction of ethylene molecules with metal decorated CNTs. Fig. 4 shows the 

response to moisture of the different sensing  hybrid materials. Three different cases were considered: the responses when relative 

humidity changed from 10 to 50%, from 10 to 80%, and from 50 to 80% were measured. Hybrid materials treated in Ar:O2 plasma show 

a significantly higher humidity response than materials treated in Ar plasma only. In fact, another effect of introducing oxygen during 

the plasma treatment of CNTs  is the modification of their surface  polarity resulting in increased hydrophilicity, which enhances the 

response to moisture. Fig. 4 shows that there is a moderate response when relative humidity changes from 50 to 80%. Furthermore, a 

sudden 30% change in relative humidity is quite unlikely. Therefore, this fact suggests that the material would suffer from moderate 

humidity interference provided that sensors are operated in an ambient atmosphere where moisture remains within this range. Fig. 5 

compares the response of an Ar:O2 plasma treated Rh-MWCNT sensor to nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and benzene when relative 

humidity was set either to 10% or 50%. This study was performed for oxygen treated sensors because these were the most responsive 

to the different species tested. Moisture levels were set to 10% and 50% because sensors significantly responded to humidity changes 

in this range (see Fig. 4). The absolute values of the slopes of the curves shown in Fig. 5 decrease when humidity increases. In other 

words, the sensitivity towards these species slightly diminishes when background moisture is raised from 10% to 50%. These results 

seem to indicate that moisture and the different gases and vapors tested compete for adsorption sites at the surface of CNTs and Rh 

clusters. The use of a humidity sensor should be considered for compensating the effects of small humidity changes.

According to the number of species studied, different concentrations tested and number of replicate measurements performed, every 

sensor characterized underwent 80 detection-recovery cycles, which spanned for about one month. No deactivation of Rh nanoparticle 

activity (i.e., significant response drift or response losses) was observed. 

4. Conclusions 

The  introduction  of  oxygen  during  the  plasma  treatment  of  carbon  nanotubes  leads  to  the  creation  of  active  sites  (i.e.  oxygenated 

vacancies) on the surface of CNTs. Additionally, reactive oxygen activates the capping agent of colloidal nanoparticles. Combined, these 

two effects improve the metal nanoparticle–CNT surface interaction, which results in a higher amount of metal nanoparticles grafted 

to CNT sidewalls and a more homogeneous decoration of CNTs. For example, the inclusion of oxygen in the Ar plasma leads to nearly 

doubling the weight of Rh attached to CNTs and preserves the original size of the nanoparticles from the colloidal solution. Furthermore, 

oxidative treatments affect the density of states of valence bands and increase the work function of MWCNTs making it closer to that 

of metals such as Rh. As a result, it is easier for electrons to travel between the metal nanoparticles and the CNT, with the direction of 

charge transfer depending on the gaseous environment. 

Therefore, the response of oxygen plasma treated, Rh-decorated MWCNTs to different gases and vapors (e.g. NO2, C2H4, CO or C6H6) 

is  substantially  increased.  It  is  worth  stressing  that  the  saturation  in  the  response  observed  with  Ar  plasma  treated,  Rh-decorated 

MWCNTs is solved when oxygen is included in the plasma treatment. The inclusion of oxygen during the plasma treatment turns CNTs 

hydrophilic and this has an impact in their response to ambient moisture. However, the response of the oxygen–argon plasma treated 

hybrid materials to humidity changes in the 50 to 80% R.H. range remains moderate. 

The CNT treatment and metal decoration employed here uses an atmospheric plasma source. It is a simple, fast and scalable method 

for producing gas sensitive nanohybrid materials with uniform and well-controlled properties.
