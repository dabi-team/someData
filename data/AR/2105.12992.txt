We have applied relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory to determine the isotope shift (IS) con-
stants of the ﬁrst eight low-lying states of the Li, Be+ and Ar15+ isoelectronic systems. Though the
RCC theory with singles, doubles and triples approximation (RCCSDT method) is an exact method
for these systems for a given set of basis functions, we notice large diﬀerences in the results from
this method when various procedures in the RCC theory framework are adopted to estimate the IS
constants. This has been demonstrated by presenting the IS constants of the aforementioned states
from the ﬁnite-ﬁeld, expectation value and analytical response (AR) approaches of the RCCSDT
method. Contributions from valence triple excitations, Breit interaction and lower-order QED ef-
fects to the evaluation of these IS constants are also highlighted. Our results are compared with
high-precision calculations reported using few-body methods wherever possible. We ﬁnd that results
from the AR procedure are more reliable than the other two approaches. This analysis is crucial for
understanding the roles of electron correlation eﬀects in the accurate determination of IS constants
in the heavier atomic systems, where few-body methods cannot be applied.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There have been a lot of demand to develop many-body
methods for the evaluation of isotope shift (IS) constants
in atomic systems, which in combination with measure-
ments oﬀer information about the nuclear charge radii
of atomic nuclei [1, 2]. These model-independent nu-
clear charge radii are used to validate diﬀerent nuclear
methods [3–5], and shed light on the nuclear many-body
problem [3, 6–8].

Owing to tiny magnitudes, estimating ISs at the ﬁrst-
order perturbation is good enough for comparing with
most of the measurements. At this approximation, con-
tribution to the IS is divided into two parts: ﬁeld-shift
(FS) and mass-shift (MS). The MS is further divided into
normal mass shift (NMS) and speciﬁc mass shift (SMS).
Theoretically, these shifts are estimated by determining
their respective constants. The FS and NMS constants
are described by one-body operators, while the SMS con-
stant is described by a two-body operator. Thus, accu-
rate calculation of the SMS constants is generally pre-
sumed to be more challenging than evaluating the FS
and NMS constants. However, the NMS constants are
usually estimated through a scaling procedure [1, 3, 5–
8] by adopting Virial theorem [9], which relates kinetic
energy with total energy of an atomic system. In some
cases, the potential of the many-body methods employed
for the determination of the SMS constants and FS con-
stants could be tested by comparing calculations with the
corresponding measurements; where the measured values
are inferred with the help of a King plot [10].

There have been attempts to describe ISs using many-
body calculations, but signiﬁcant diﬀerences are observed

† bohayon@ethz.ch

among the experimental values and the results from the
many-body calculations [11–18].
In fact, often high-
accuracy calculations are claimed for the FS constants
to infer the nuclear charge radii but the same methods
show large deviations of the NMS constants from the
their scaled values. This may seriously question the va-
lidity of the inferred nuclear charge radii, as well as the

imperative to systematically analyze the approaches and
the many-body methods considered to estimate the IS
constants.

Generally, the calculated energies from a particular
method compare well with the corresponding experimen-
tal values, validating the accuracy of the atomic wave
functions. However, this condition is not suﬃcient to as-
certain the accuracy of the calculated IS constants, as
is shown in this work. Customarily, wave functions of a
multi-electron system are obtained at least in two steps;
First a mean-ﬁeld approach is adopted and then, the ne-
glected electron correlation eﬀects are included system-
atically. Conﬁguration interaction (CI) method and its
variants are typically employed to evaluate the IS con-
stants of atomic systems [16, 18]. However, it is not pos-
sible to employ a full CI method to an atomic system
with more than three electrons using the available com-
putational facilities even with a reasonable size of basis
function. Coupled-cluster (CC) theory is considered to
be a more potent many-body method compared to a CI
method at a given level of truncation for calculating wave
functions of multi-electron systems. This is because it ac-
counts for size-extensitivity and size-consistent behavior,
and captures more physical eﬀects due to the electron
correlations [19, 20] than the truncated CI methods at
similar level of approximation.

There are many variants of CC methods proposed in
the literature for accurate determination of atomic prop-
[19, 21]). However, these meth-
erties (e.g. see Refs.

 
 
 
 
 
 
ods are not explored extensively while reporting the IS
constants to examine the reliability of the calculations.
The relativistic version of CC (RCC) theory is a natu-
ral choice to apply for accurate determination of the IS
constants. Furthermore, in most cases many-body meth-
ods are applied in the ﬁnite-ﬁeld (FF) framework for the
estimations of the IS constants [13, 14, 16–18]. In this
work, we analyze the IS constants (i.e.
the FS, NMS
and SMS constants) by performing many-body calcula-
tions in three diﬀerent procedures; namely the aforemen-
tioned FF, a direct expectation value evaluation (EVE),
and analytical response (AR) approaches. We have thus
adopted the RCC theory framework to formulate these
three approaches.

The many-body theories like CI and RCC methods are
apt for determining properties of atomic systems having
more than three electrons, while one can ﬁnd other meth-
ods that are more suitable for high-precision calculations
in a few electron atomic systems [22–25].
It is, how-
ever, convenient to apply a newly developed many-body
approach to the lithium (Li) atom and its isoelectronic
atomic systems to benchmark potential of the method
to incorporate electron correlation and relativistic eﬀects
[26, 27]. This is owing to the fact that a many-body
theory becomes an exact method with singles, doubles
and triples approximation with a given set of basis func-
tions. Besides, a number of analysis can be performed
on these systems within a stipulated time frame due to
their small sizes. For this purpose, we have considered
here the neutral Li atom, singly charged beryllium (Be+)
and highly charged Li-like argon (Ar15+) ion to analyze
their IS shifts. Also, we calculate the IS constants for
as many as eight low-lying states of the above systems so
that it can oﬀer more insight into the role of electron cor-
relation eﬀects in the atomic systems by analysing trends
in the results of the states belonging to diﬀerent angular
momentum and level positioning.

respectively, where α is the ﬁne-structure constant, Z is

As can be seen from the expression given by Eq. (4),
the NMS operator expression contains p2. The Virial
theorem suggests kinetic energy is equal to negative of
the total energy in a spherically symmetric system [32].
In the scaling approach, therefore, the NMS constant is
given by K NMS
meEexpt with the experimental en-
ergy of the state Eexpt. As seen from the above equa-
tion, the NMS operator has more terms and the rela-
tivistic form of the kinetic energy is slightly diﬀerent than
p2/2me. Moreover, only S states are spherically symmet-
ric in atomic systems, and so the NMS constants of these
states may obey the Virial theorem. There could be de-
viation from this scaling in the other states, which needs

an electron from the valence orbital of the atomic state

by taking the diﬀerence ∆Ev = Ev −
equivalent to the ionization potential (I.P.) of the valence
electron.

We have approximated the RCC excitation operators
T and Sv at the singles, doubles and triples excitations,
denoted by

T = T1 + T2

and Sv = S1v + S2v + S3v,

(12)

where the subscripts 1, 2 and 3 denote for the level of ex-
citation respectively. It should be noted that the T oper-
ator can only have up to the double excitations as there
are only two core electrons present in the Li-like atomic
systems. To fathom contributions from the triple excita-
tions arising through the S3v operator, we also compute
calculations considering only the singles and doubles ex-
citations in the Sv operator by expressing Sv = S1v + S2v
in the RCC theory (denoted by RCCSD method).

B. Evaluation of IS constants in the FF approach

The IS constant of the respective O operator can be de-
termined in the FF approach by using an eﬀective Hamil-
tonian H = H0+λO, where H0 is the atomic Hamiltonian
without the IS interactions and λ is an arbitrary param-
eter. Then, the electron aﬃnity obtained by considering
the above Hamiltonian can be expressed as

∆Ev(λ) = ∆E(0)

v + λ∆E(1)

v +

(λ)2,

O

(13)

where superscripts (0), (1), etc. denote the order of per-
(λ)2 indicates corrections higher than
turbation and
the ﬁrst-order. For a very small value of λ, we get

In the perturbative approach,

it corresponds to
∆E(1)
. This approach is commonly adopted in the
i
evaluation of the IS constants. However, we would like
to draw attention of several drawbacks of this approach.
(λ)2 contributions
First of all, it forcefully assumes that
in Eq. (15) are negligible compared with the ﬁrst-order
contribution. This may not always be the case, thus, it
could result in numerical inaccuracy in the estimation.
This inaccuracy could potentially be overcome by choos-
ing λ values diﬀerently for the FS, NMS and SMS con-
stants, which is obvious from Eq. (1). Moreover, this
could also be state dependent for a given atomic system.
Therefore, appropriate choice of λ for the respective IS
constant requires knowledge of their strengths a priori
which is not always possible. In this work, we have used
10−5 to determine the FS, NMS
a ﬁxed value λ = 1.0

×

and SMS constants to carry out our analysis. Further
smaller value of λ may lead to truncation errors in the
calculations.

C. Evaluation of IS constants in the EVE approach

It is obvious from the above discussion that the IS
constants can also be evaluated directly in the EVE ap-
proach by using the wave functions of the unperturbed
Hamiltonian H0. In fact, any general physical property
of an atomic system is evaluated as the expectation value
of the corresponding operator. Thus, this should be the
most convenient approach to evaluate the IS constants.
However, EVE is less popular than the FF approach in
the context of calculating the IS constants. This is owing
to the fact that FF can account for the orbital relaxation
eﬀects at the DHF level, which are missing in the DHF
values of the EVE approach. Since these orbital relax-
ation eﬀects are quite strong due to the IS eﬀects, they
have to be adequately included in the post DHF calcula-

tions through the EVE approach.

In the RCC theory framework, the EVE expression is

where O = (OeT (0)
ﬁrst-order correction to electron aﬃnity due to O by

)l. Therefore, we can estimate the

where amplitudes of the T and Sv operators are obtained
using H0 in Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively. As can be
seen, the above expression contains two non-terminating
series, namely, eT †
eT in the numerator and
denominator respectively. Moreover, the above expres-
sion does not satisfy the Hellmann-Feynman theorem
[19, 36]. These are the main disadvantages of adopting
the EVE approach for the determination of IS constants
in the RCC theory framework.

OeT and eT †

D. Evaluation of IS constants in the AR approach

The problems of the FF and EVE approaches in the
determination of the IS constants can be circumvented
by applying the AR approach in the RCC theory frame-
work [21]. The basic notion of this approach lies in the
fact that it evaluates the IS constants as the ﬁrst-order
energy correction like in the FF approach, albeit its start-
ing point is the same as in the EVE approach. However,
unlike FF, AR does not depend on the perturbative pa-
rameter λ, and higher-order perturbative corrections do
not appear in the expression.

Following the FF approach, the wave function and en-
ergy due to the total Hamiltonian H = H0 + λO can be
expanded as

E0 = E(0)

and

and

(λ)2

Sv = S(0)

Substituting the expanded forms of the Hamiltonian and

the terms linear in λ, we get

It is evident from these equations that the above proce-
dure of evaluating IS constants does not depend on the
choice of λ, and that the lowest-order contributions are
the same as the values obtained in the EVE approach.
The amplitudes of the T (1) and S(1)

tained by solving the following equations

The AR approach, however, is more computationally de-
manding due to evaluation of amplitudes of both the un-
perturbed and perturbed RCC operators.

E. Approximations in H0

The ﬁrst approximation in our calculation is taken
in the atomic Hamiltonian H0, which is considered ini-
tially as the Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian. The DC
Hamiltonian in atomic units (a.u.) is given by

H DC =

cαD

P

rij

where c is speed of light, β is the Dirac matrix, p is
rep-
the single particle momentum operator and
resents the Coulomb potential between the electrons lo-
cated at the ith and jth positions.
It should be noted
that the above Hamiltonian is scaled with respect to the
rest mass energies of electrons and calculations are per-
formed by using the electron mass in the kinetic energy
term rather than the reduced mass µA. The notation for
the dependency of Vn(r) on the rms radius of the nucleus
is dropped for the convenience. Corrections to the ener-
gies due to ﬁnite mass of the nucleus are included sep-
arately at the later stage. Contributions from the Breit
interaction to the DC Hamiltonian (DCB Hamiltonian)
are determined by including the following potential

V B =

j + (αD

,

(26)

where ˆrij is the unit vector along rij.

Contributions from the QED eﬀects to the DC Hamil-
tonian (DCQ Hamiltonian) are estimated by considering
the lower-order vacuum polarization (VP) and the self-
energy (SE) interactions. We account for VV P through
[38] potentials
the Uehling [37] and Wichmann-Kroll

F. Basis functions

We have used Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) [46] to
construct the single particle DHF wave functions. The
radial component of a DHF orbital from the orbital an-
gular momentum l are given by using these GTOs as

f (r) = rl

Nl

e−ηζkr2

,

(38)

Xk
where η and ζ are the optimized GTO parameters for a
given orbital, and Nl represents the number of GTOs for
the corresponding l-symmetry orbital. We have consid-
ered 40 GTOs, and universal basis functions by consid-
ering η = 0.0009 and ζ = 2.15 for each symmetry up to
l = 4. Numerical radial integration are carried out on
a non-linear grid distribution, i = 1, n with number of
grids n, by deﬁning radial distance as

r(i) = r0

e(i−1)h

h

−

,

i

(39)

where r0 is a very small parameter and h is the step
size. In our calculation, we have used n = 1200 for all
the atomic systems while we have considered h = 0.018
10−7 for the Li atom, h = 0.018 and
and r0 = 3.3
10−7 for the Be+ ion, and h = 0.019 and
r0 = 2.5
r0 = 5.6

×
10−8 for the Ar15+ ion.

×

We have estimated uncertainties to all the calculated
quantities from the use of the ﬁnite-size basis functions
and extrapolated numerical truncation. These uncertain-
ties are quoted along with the ﬁnal results while compar-
ing with the literature values.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We discuss ﬁrst the I.P.s of the low-lying states of the
Li-like systems investigated in this work. Since Ar15+
is a highly charged ion, where relativistic and QED ef-
fects can be signiﬁcant, we present results from the DC,
DCB and DCQ Hamiltonians separately for Li, Be+ and
Ar15+. This can demonstrate the increase in relativistic

In Table I, we present results for the Li atom using the
above approximations in the atomic Hamiltonian from
the DHF, RCCSD and full RCC methods. In addition,
we also give the values from the second-order relativis-
tic many-body perturbation theory (RMP(2) method).
As can be seen from the above table, the calculated val-
ues of the electron aﬃnities gradually increase from their
DHF values, through lower-order methods, and up to the
RCC method in all three type of approximations in the
Hamiltonian. The Breit interaction contributes slightly
higher than the QED eﬀects, but their magnitudes are
very small. The diﬀerences between the RCCSD and
RCC results are on the order of 10−4, demonstrating
that high-order correlations for Li energies are more pro-
nounced than the Breit or QED eﬀects, which enter at
the level of < 10−5.

We present the calculated values of the electron aﬃnity
of Be+ from diﬀerent Hamiltonians using the aforemen-
tioned methods in Table II. The trends for Be+ are found

to be similar to Li, with the magnitude of the triple-
excitation contribution diminished to the level of 10−5.
Both the Breit and QED contributions are found to be
slightly higher in magnitudes compared with the Li atom,
as expected. Trends in the results from both the tables
presenting for the Li atom and the Be+ ion also show that
the Breit and QED eﬀects are large in the S states fol-
lowed by the P1/2 states, while they are negligibly small
in the D states. The QED eﬀects are almost identical in
both the P1/2 and P3/2 states.

In Table III, we give the energy values for Ar15+ from
the same methods that were employed to the energy cal-
culations of Li and Be+.
It can be seen from this ta-
ble that the trends of electron correlation contributions
and the relativistic eﬀects are very diﬀerent in Ar15+
compared to the previous discussed results of Li and
Be+. Though we ﬁnd that there are signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences among the results from the RMP(2) and RCCSD
methods, very small diﬀerences among the results from
the RCCSD and RCC methods are observed. This shows
that inclusion of triple excitations is important in the

neutral or singly charged Li-like systems, but they are
less important in the highly charged ions. It also demon-
strates that both the Breit and QED interactions are
quite large in this ion, with the Breit contributions larger
than the QED eﬀects. Also, most of the QED eﬀects are
contributing through the DHF method and the electron
correlations aﬀect to their contributions only slightly. It
is worth mentioning here that the QED eﬀects are esti-
mated in this work using an eﬀective potential. There-
fore, when higher accuracy is desired for Ar15+, it is im-
perative to estimate them rigorously using a more appro-
priate QED method.

Adding all contributions from the DC Hamiltonian and
corrections from the Breit and QED interactions (DCBQ
contributions), we present the ﬁnal values of the elec-
tron aﬃnity of the ﬁrst eight low-lying states of the three
considered atomic systems in Table IV. To compare with
experimentally measured values, we have taken into ac-
count corrections from our use of inﬁnite nuclear mass
by adding the NMS and SMS contributions determined
in this work, scaled with the mass of the speciﬁc isotope

in question. We emphasize that it is not enough to scale
the energies with the reduced mass, which accounts for
the nonrelativistic NMS, as the SMS eﬀects are quite ap-
preciable, especially for the nP levels.

For 7Li, we compare the ground-state ionization en-
ergy with the experimental value from Ref.
[48]. For
the other states, we compare the results after combin-
ing with transition frequencies from Ref. [49]. For Be+,
we rely on a recent critical compilation [50], and refer
the readers to a discussion on the determination of the
ionization energy therein. For Ar15+, an accurate exper-
imental ionization potential is not available and so we
take the ground state energy from a high accuracy cal-
culation [51], and measured transitions from the ground
state, reviewed in [52, 53]. In Table V, we also compare
the excitation energies of the D1 and D2 lines of Ar15+
from the high-precision calculations using the few-body
methods [51, 54] with our results, which shows excel-
lent agreement among these results. These comparisons
imply that the uncertainties arising from the numerical
computations and incomplete basis functions used in the

calculations are quite small. Thus, we believe that the
calculated wave functions of the RCC method can be
used reliably for the accurate estimation of the IS con-
stants.

After analyzing the energies, we discuss the calculated
values of the IS constants systematically. For better un-
derstanding of the trend of these calculations from the
FF, EVE and AR approaches in the RCC theory frame-
work, we present results for the FS constants ﬁrst, fol-
lowed by the NMS constants, then give the SMS con-
stants in the end. As mentioned in the previous para-
graph, the calculated unperturbed wave functions in our
RCC method are presumed to be very accurate as the
electron aﬃnity energies obtained using the calculated
wave functions agreed quite well with the literature val-
ues. Since the unperturbed wave functions are common
to the FF, EVE and AR procedures to estimate the IS
constants, any diﬀerences observed among the results ob-
tained by adopting these three approaches can indicate
the shortcomings of their formulations. Therefore, the
present study can serve to test the potentials of the em-
ployed approaches.

In Table VI, we present the FS constants for all the
investigated states of Li, Be+ and Ar15+ for the compari-
son. We only consider the DC Hamiltonian and evaluate
the FS constants in the FF, EVE and AR approaches.
Further, we give results in the DHF, RCCSD and full

RCC calculations in order to show the propagation of
electron correlation eﬀects from the mean-ﬁeld calcula-
tion to the more exact method through the respective
approach. As can be seen from the above table, the DHF
values of the FS constants from the FF approach and
from the other two approaches are very diﬀerent. This
demonstrates that orbital relaxation eﬀects are quite sig-
niﬁcant in the determination of the FS constants. In the
FF method, which is a perturbative approach, orbital re-
laxation arises through the all-order core-polarization ef-
fects that are usually incorporated by the random-phase
approximation (RPA). It is a well known fact that the
RPA eﬀects are implicitly present in the RCC theory
when it is formulated using the DHF wave function [55–
57]. Therefore, the orbital relaxation eﬀects are embed-
ded in the EVE and AR approaches post the DHF cal-
culations. We also notice that the RCCSD results are
comparable for all the states of Be+ and Ar15+, whereas
the results of the Li atom from the FF approach show
large deviation. Whereas the RCCSD and full RCC re-
sults from the EVE and AR approaches are very close to
each other, the results from these methods have signif-
icant diﬀerences with respect to the FF approach. We
had seen earlier that the accuracy of energies was im-
proved from the RCCSD method to the RCC method.
Thus, the above trend clearly suggests that the FF val-
ues are highly unstable for the numerical diﬀerentiation

with a particular choice of perturbative parameter λ for
the determination of the FS constants. This could be
due to the fact that calculations of the FS constants are
more sensitive to the radial behaviors of the calculated
wave functions in the nuclear region. Perhaps this can
be avoided by choosing diﬀerent λ parameter for both
the RCCSD and RCC calculations, but this turns out
to be a shortcoming of the FF approach for this estima-
tion of the FS constants. We ﬁnd that the results from
the RCCSD method and the full RCC calculations in the
EVE and AR approaches are very close to each other.
This indicates convergences in the results in both the ap-
proaches, and it suggests that the contributions from the
(16) could be very
terms that are neglected from Eq.
small. This may be because of the fact that the inves-
tigated systems have only a few electrons. However, we
had observed large diﬀerences between the RCCSD re-
sults from both the approaches in our earlier calculation
for the indium atom [58].

From the above analysis, we believe that the RCC re-
sults obtained by the AR approach are more reliable ow-
ing to the fact that it evaluates the property expression
more accurately. To determine the ﬁnal results for the FS
constants, we also performed calculations using the DCB
and DCQ Hamiltonians in the AR approach. To show the
change in the results due to these higher-order relativis-
tic eﬀects, we present results at the DHF, RCCSD and
RCC level of calculations using the above Hamiltonians.
These results are quoted in Table VII. After accounting
for the corrections from the DCB and DCQ Hamiltoni-
ans to the contributions from the DC Hamiltonian, the
DCBQ values are listed in the above table. The correc-
tions from the Breit interaction to the FS constants are
larger than those from the QED eﬀects, and amount to
1% for Ar15+.

We now discuss the results of the NMS constants, given
in Table VIII. As can be seen from the table, and unlike
in the case of FS constants discussed earlier, the NMS
constants for Li and Ar15+ from the FF approach agree
reasonably well with the values obtained using the EVE
and AR approaches. However, there are drastic changes
in some of the FF values of Be+ from the RCCSD method
to the full RCC calculations, which was unexpected. It
may be possible to minimize such diﬀerences by changing
the perturbative parameter considered in our calculation,
but this ascertains our earlier ﬁnding that the results
from the FF approach become highly dependent on the
choice of the λ value. The diﬀerences of the results among
the EVE and AR approaches are in general very small,
excluding the 2P1/2 level, where the EVE value deviates
slightly from the FF and AR values, which agree with
each other.

On the reasons mentioned earlier, we consider the RCC
results from the AR approach as the most reliable. The
DCBQ values of the NMS constants of the ﬁrst eight low-
lying states of the aforementioned systems are listed in
Table IX. In the case of NMS constants, we ﬁnd that
both the Breit and QED interactions contribute less to

13

Li and Be+, whereas they are small but not insigniﬁcant
in the Ar+ ion. This also asserts that QED eﬀects con-
tribute to the NMS constants of the S states more than
to the other states. It could be because of the fact that
the NMS constants are related to the kinetic energy of
the electrons in an atomic system. In Table IX, we also
give the values obtained from the scaling law. In all lev-
els of the considered three systems, agreement is found
between scaling and our calculation to below < 0.5%.
This fact may not be surprising for Li and Be+, where
relativistic eﬀects play a smaller role, but may be consid-
ered surprising for a highly charged ion like Ar15+. The
resilience of the scaling law for the D1/D2 transitions in
these systems is also demonstrated in [26? ].

Finally, we discuss the SMS constants of the under-
taken Li-like systems, given in table X. These are gen-
erally considered to be more challenging to determine
accurately than the other two constants owing to the
two-body form of operator. As expected, the nP -states
exhibit larger correlation eﬀects, while orbital relaxation
eﬀects are found to be of moderate size. Here, results for
all the three approaches show a converging trend, and
the discrepancies are minute. For Be+ and Ar15+, the
results for the nS states in the FF approach diﬀer; oth-
erwise there is a good agreement in the results among
all other states. In fact, there is better agreement in the
results between the FF and AR approaches, than with
the EVE approach, which shows small but signiﬁcant de-
viations for the nP -states. Adding the Breit and QED
contributions to the results from the AR approach, we
quote the DCBQ values for the SMS constants of the
considered states of Li, Be+ and Ar15+ in Table XI. In
the same table, we also give results from the DCB and
DCQ Hamiltonians. From the comparison of the results
from the DCB Hamiltonian and DCQ Hamiltonian with
the DC Hamiltonian, we ﬁnd that the Breit interaction
contribute to some extent to the evaluation of the SMS
constants of the ground level and contributions from the
QED eﬀects are comparably very small.

Having assessed the stability and diﬀerences in the re-
sults from the three many-body approaches of the RCC
theory, we now turn to compare our results with those
of very accurate theories, which are available for such
systems. Using the FS constants of the individual states
listed in the aforementioned tables, we give their diﬀer-
ential values in Table XII for the transitions in which
very accurate calculations exist. In general the values re-
ported in this work for both the EVE and AR approaches
are very close < 1% to those of more accurate theories.
We note that we evaluate the FS constants up to the
ﬁrst-order in δ
, while some earlier calculations also in-
i
clude contributions from the higher moments. Therefore,
we have distinguished the ﬁrst-order contributions from
r2
δ
to the FS constants for the comparison purpose.

This emphasizes that for such systems, a determination
of the FS constants to < 1% must include a discussion
of such corrections. For Ar15+, we compare our results
with [45]. These are found to agree extremely well on the

Coulomb and Breit interactions (here together quoted as
Breit contribution), and deviate by 0.7% when the QED
corrections are included. As both of this work and [45]
used crude method to estimate these corrections, we em-
phasize that if higher accuracy is required, more reﬁned
QED corrections should be investigated.

In Table XIII, we compare the results of our MS calcu-
lations with the values reported in high-precision calcula-
tions using few-body methods, which quote the total re-
coil and not the individual (SMS or NMS) contributions.
We consider the total MS obtained within the EVE and
AR methods, as well as the procedure adopted in most
of the IS literature, which is to combine the calculated
SMS with the NMS given by the scaling law. For Li and

Be+, we ﬁnd the combined value of SMS from AR-RCC
and the NMS values from scaling to be the closest to the
accurate values, followed by the calculated values from
AR. The EVE MS is in most cases close and slightly less
accurate than AR. For the D1/D2 transitions, the EVE
SMS deviates from its accurate value. An eﬀect which is
compensated for the D1 transitions by an opposite devi-
ation of the EVE NMS values. For Ar15+, an agreement
between the diﬀerent methods in the Breit level is found
to the level of one percent.

We observe large diﬀerences between the QED correc-
tions estimated by us with the calculations carried out
using the few-body methods. Whereas for Li and Be+
these diﬀerences are negligible in respect to our numeri-

15

cal accuracy and neglected second-order mass shifts, they
are quite large in Ar15+.

V. CONCLUSION

We employed the relativistic coupled-cluster theory
in three diﬀerent procedures; namely ﬁnite-ﬁeld, ex-
pectation value evaluation, and analytical response ap-
proaches, to determine the isotope shift constants of
low-lying states of the lithium atom, and lithium-like
beryllium and argon ions. Results are also given by ap-
proximating atomic Hamiltonian to the Dirac-Coulomb,
Dirac-Coulomb-Breit and Dirac-Coulomb-QED Hamilto-
nians separately using the analytical response approach.
The diﬀerences among the results from these approxi-
mated Hamiltonians demonstrate the importance of the
relativistic eﬀects to the isotope shift constants in the
above atomic systems. The trend of the electron corre-
lation eﬀects were investigated by analysing results with
respect to the mean-ﬁeld calculations, and considering
singles and doubles approximations in the relativistic
coupled-cluster theory, and from the exact calculations.
We found that the electron correlation trends are com-
pletely diﬀerent in the considered three systems. Among
the aforementioned three approaches, results from the
ﬁnite-ﬁeld approach are observed to be the least reliable.

Though the starting point of the expectation value eval-
uation and analytical response approaches are the same,
we notice signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the isotope shift con-
stants even in the full relativistic coupled-cluster calcula-
tions. By comparing with accurate results from few-body
methods, we surmise that the analytical response method
is more reliable and accurate than the expectation value
evaluation approach for mass-shift constants, and com-
parable for the ﬁeld shifts. As these many-body methods
are suited for systems with more electrons, where few-
body methods cannot be applied, our analysis suggests
that the analytical response approach in the relativistic
coupled-cluster theory framework can be employed to de-
termine the isotope shift constants more reliably than the
other two approaches. Lastly, we found that when QED
corrections for the isotope shifts constants are desired,
such as for precise calculations in highly charged ions, it
does not suﬃce to evaluate at the Breit-level isotope shift
operators. So it may require higher-order corrections to
be accounted for.
