We discuss some aspects of Sousa et al.[ 1,2] concerning two mechanisms of gravita-
tional wave (GW) emission in fast-spinning white dwarfs (WDs): accretion of matter and
magnetic deformation. In both cases, the GW emission is generated by an asymmetry
around the rotation axis of the star. However, in the ﬁrst case, the asymmetry is due to
the amount of accreted matter in the magnetic poles, while in the second case it is due
to the intense magnetic ﬁeld. We have estimated the GW amplitude and luminosity for
three binary systems that have a fast-spinning magnetized WD, namely, AE Aquarii, AR
Scorpii and RX J0648.0-4418. In addition, we applied the magnetic deformation mecha-
nism for SGRs/AXPs described as WD pulsars. We found that, for the ﬁrst mechanism,
the systems AE Aquarii and RX J0648.0-4418 can be observed by the space detectors
BBO and DECIGO if they have an amount of accreted mass of δm ≥ 10−5M(cid:12). For
the second mechanism, the three systems studied require that the WD has a magnetic
ﬁeld above ∼ 109 G to emit GWs that can be detected by BBO. Furthermore, we found
that some SGRs/AXPs as WD pulsars can be detected by BBO and DECIGO, whereas
SGRs/AXPs as highly magnetized neutron stars are far below the sensitivity curves of
these detectors.

Keywords: Gravitational Waves; White Dwarfs; Magnetic Field; Rapid Rotation.

1. Introduction

Over the last years, the astrophysical community’s interest in highly magnetized
white dwarfs (HMWDs) has increased. Recent results of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) have conﬁrmed these white dwarfs (WDs) with surface magnetic
ﬁelds ranging from 106 G up to 109 G [see e.g. Refs. 3–5]. Besides their high
magnetic ﬁelds, most of them have been shown to be massive, and responsible for
the high-mass peak at 1 M(cid:12) of the WD mass distribution 3,6,7.

Typically, WDs have rotation periods of days or even years. However, recently,
a WD pulsar was discovered, called AR Scorpii. This star emits from X-ray to
radio wavelengths, pulsing in brightness with a period of 1.97 min 8. Moreover,
other sources have been proposed as candidates of WD pulsars. Speciﬁc examples

are AE Aquarii with a short rotation period of P = 33.08 s 9 and RX J0648.0-4418
(RX J0648, hereafter) that is a massive WD with M = 1.28M(cid:12) and with a very
fast spin period of P = 13.2 s, that belongs to the binary system HD 49798/RX
J0648.0-4418 10. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the nature of RX J0648 is
unclear, meaning it is not yet clearly known whether this star is a WD or a neutron
star 11,12.

Recently, from XMM-Newton observations, the authors in Ref. 13 reported that
CTCV J2056-3014 is a X-ray-faint intermediate polar harboring an extremely fast-
spinning WD with a coherent pulsation of 29.6 s, thus being the fastest conﬁrmed
spin in a WD [see also Ref. 14]. Other fast-spinning WDs have been observed more
recently. As examples we can cite: V1460 Her, which is an eclipsing cataclysmic
variable, with a overluminous K5-type donor star and a WD that rotates with a
period of 38.9 s 15 and ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, which is a highly magnetized and
rapidly rotating white dwarf, featuring a magnetic ﬁeld with strengths between 600
MG and 900 MG on its surface, and a stellar radius that is only slightly larger than
the radius of the Moon 16. This WD has a rotation period of 6.94 min which is
considered short as this star is an isolated WD.

Notwithstanding, several studies of magnetized and fast-rotating WDs have been
done. In particular, we can highlight one involving WD pulsars in an alternative de-
scription for Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars (AXPs)
[see e.g. Refs. 17–20]. From this perspective, the process of energy emission released
by dipole radiation in a WD can be explained by a canonical spin-powered pulsar
model, since they share quite similar aspects 18,21.

On the other hand, LIGO and Virgo detectors have recently made direct ob-
servations of gravitational waves (GWs) 22,23. All these GW detections are within
a frequency band ranging from 10 Hz to 1000 Hz, which is the operating band of
LIGO and Virgo. Nevertheless, as is well known, there are proposed missions for
lower frequencies, such as LISA 24,25, whose frequency band is of (10−4 − 0.01) Hz,
BBO 26,27 and DECIGO 28,29 in the frequency band ranging from 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz.
The generation of continuous GWs in diﬀerent possibilities has already been
proposed 30–34. More recently, in Refs. 1,2,35, it has been suggested that rotating
magnetized WDs can emit continuous GWs with amplitudes possibly detected by
upcoming GW detectors such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO. Here we revisit our two
works [Refs. 1,2], where we investigate two mechanisms of gravitational radiation
emission in fast-rotating magnetized WD: matter accretion and magnetic deforma-
tion. In both cases, the emission in GW is produced by the asymmetry around the
star’s rotation axis.

2. Gravitational emission mechanisms

WDs might generate gravitational radiation whether they are not perfectly symmet-
ric around their rotation axis. The huge dipole magnetic ﬁeld that can make the star
become oblate 36 and accretion of matter are two examples where this asymmetry

can occur.

2.1. Accretion of matter

The GW emission is shown here for the case of a WD accreting matter via the
magnetic poles which do not coincide with the rotation axis of the star. In this sce-
nario, the system’s secondary star transfers matter to the WD through an accretion
column and accumulates an amount of mass on the magnetic poles.

Thus, we consider a rigid object rotating about a non-major axis (x1, x2, x3)
and which has a deformity about one of the major axes (x1, x2, x3), where are
positioned the main moments of inertia I1, I2 e I3, respectively.

With this conﬁguration and doing I1 = I2, the gravitational amplitude and

luminosity are given respectively by 37,38

where, ω is the angular velocity, θ is the angle between the rotation and magnetic
dipole axes and r is the distance to the emitting source.

Now, to determine the moments of inertia I1 and I3, we consider that the object
has an amount of mass accumulated on the x(cid:48)
3 axis. We reduce this system to a
large sphere with two smaller spheres of matter on the x(cid:48)
3 axis: one at each of the
poles of the larger sphere. This would be equivalent to a WD accreting matter by
the two magnetic poles. Therefore, it follows immediately that

Thereby, we ﬁnd expressions for the gravitational luminosity and the GW am-
plitude for the case of a WD accumulating mass, which depends on the accreted
mass, the distance to the source, the radius of the star and how fast it is rotating.

2.2. Magnetic deformation

This section deals with the deformation of the WD induced by its own huge magnetic
ﬁeld. Due to the combination of magnetic ﬁeld and rotation, a WD can become
triaxial, presenting therefore a triaxial moment of inertia. In order to investigate the
eﬀect arising from the magnetic stress on the equilibrium of stars, let us introduce
the equatorial ellipticity, deﬁned as 37,38

(cid:15) =

I1 − I2

.

(6)

where I1, I2 and I3 are main moments of inertia with respect to the (x, y, z) axes,
respectively.

If the star rotates around the z−axis, then it will emit monochromatic GWs

with a frequency twice the rotation frequency, frot, with amplitude given by 37,38

where, Bs is the magnetic ﬁeld strength on the star’s surface and κ is the distortion

Now, substituting this last equation into Eqs. (7) and (8) and considering I3 =

Note that the two equations just above depend on the rotation frequency and

the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

In contrast, the GW amplitude can also be written as a function of the variation
of the star’s rotation frequency ˙frot. In this case, we must consider that a part of
the spindown luminosity is converted into GWs. Thus, we can infer an eﬃciency,
ηdf , for the variation of the rotation frequency as ˙¯frot = ηdf
˙frot, such that ˙¯frot
˙frot related to the GW brake. Hence, the GW
can be interpreted as the part of

3. Gravitational waves from rapid rotation white dwarfs

3.1. Accretion of matter

Considering the scenario of an amount of mass accumulated on the magnetic poles,
we apply Eq. (4) for the three binary systems that have fast-spinning WDs: AE
Aqr, AR Sco and RX J0648. The parameters for the systems are listed in Table 1.
From Eq. (4), one notes that the amplitude depends on the amount of mass
accumulated; however, it is not easy to predict how much matter may have been
accreted to WD and how much has been dispersed on its surface. Thus, for this
analysis, we assign four values for the mountain of matter for the analyzed systems:
δm = (10−3M(cid:12), 10−4M(cid:12), 10−5M(cid:12), 10−6M(cid:12)) [see Refs. 41–43 for details about
accretion in WDs]. Besides that, we consider that the angle between the magnetic
and rotation axes is θ = 30◦.

With the amplitude estimations, we compare them with the sensitivity curves of
the gravitational wave space detectors. This outcome is shown in Figure 2 where we
have the sensitivity curve for LISA, BBO and DECIGO with a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 8 and an integration time of T = 1 yr. We notice from this ﬁgure that
AE Aqr and RX J0648 are good candidates to be detected by BBO and DECIGO

if they have an accumulated mass of δm ≥ 10−5M(cid:12). For the AR Sco system, the
gravitational radiation emitted by this process would hardly be able to be detected
by the three space instruments. This system would need to have a very high mass
mountain of ∼ 10−3M(cid:12) to be above, for example, the sensitivity curve of the BBO
detector.

Fig. 2. GW amplitude for AE Aqr, AR Sco and RX J0648 for diﬀerent values of mass (10−3M(cid:12),
10−4M(cid:12), 10−5M(cid:12), 10−6M(cid:12), from top to bottom) and the sensitivity curves for LISA, BBO and
DECIGO for SN R = 8 and integration time of T = 1 yr.

Now, we consider the eﬃciency of this mechanism with respect to the rotational
energy rate lost by the systems. To do this, we consider the eﬃciency of the process
(ηacr = LGWacr /Lsd) for the four δm’s considered above, i.e., how much of the spin-
down luminosity is converted to gravitational luminosity for every δm (see Table
2). We ﬁnd that the contribution of gravitational luminosity to the spindown lumi-

October 4, 2021 0:40

nosity is irrelevant, since, for the four values of δm adopted, the eﬃciency ηacr (cid:28) 1.
Thereby, the contribution of gravitational luminosity to the spindown luminosity is
negligible when we consider this mechanism.

3.2. Magnetic deformation

Here, we consider the generation of GWs due to the deformation of the WD structure
of the same binary systems (AE Aqr, AR Sco and RX J0648) caused by their own
intense magnetic ﬁeld. For this, we use Eq. (12) to calculate the GW amplitude
as a function of the eﬃciency ηdf = LGWdef /Lsd. The GW amplitudes are shown
in Figure 3 as a function of ηdf , where we use the parameters of Table 1 for all 3
systems.

Fig. 3. GW amplitude for diﬀerent values of eﬃciency (ηdf = LGWdef /Lsd) to AE Aqr, AR Sco
and RX J0648

From Figure 4, we plot the GW amplitudes inferred in Figure 3, together with
sensitivity curves for LISA, BBO and DECIGO for one year of integration time and
SN R = 8. It is worth noting that all three systems are detectable by BBO and
DECIGO as long as AE Aqr has an eﬃciency ηdf ≥ 10−6, AR Sco an eﬃciency

October 4, 2021 0:40

ws-procs961x669

ws-procs961x669 page 8

8

ηdf ≥ 10−4 and RX J0648 an eﬃciency ηdf ≥ 10−5. Thus, even if the GWs have
a small contribution to the spindown of these systems, they can emit GWs with
amplitudes that can be detected by the space antennas.

Fig. 4. GW amplitudes as presented in Figure 3 compared to the sensitivity curves of LISA, BBO
and DECIGO for SN R = 8 and integration time of T = 1 year. Here, the eﬃciency values (1,
10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5, 10−6, 10−7 and 10−8) are displayed from top to bottom.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to know what the value of the magnetic ﬁeld needed
to produce these detectable amplitudes. Thus, we calculate the magnetic ﬁeld
strength so that these sources can be detected by BBO, which is the most sensitive
instrument of the three considered in the present work. To do so, we use Eq. (10)
together with the minimum eﬃciency for which each system is detectable by this
instrument and we adopted κ (cid:39) 10 [see Ref. 46]. Table 3 shows theses results.
Notice that the systems must have WDs with high magnetic ﬁelds, around (109 −
1010) G, which are about two orders of magnitude larger than the canonical model
of WD pulsars.

In addition, we can further calculate the GW amplitude by considering the
upper limit values of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, Bdip, inferred from the canonical
model of WD pulsars. Table 4 presents the results of this study. Notice that the
amplitudes of the GW shown in this Table is very small to be observed by the space
detectors, since they are well below the sensitivities of these detectors.
In other
words, the space detectors will not be able to detect these sources when considering
the upper limit of the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

3.3. GWs from SGRs/AXPs as fast-spinning WDs

An alternative model has been proposed for SGRs/AXPs considering they are fast-
rotating and magnetized WDs [see e.g. Refs. 17–20 for further details]. From
this perspective, a canonical spin-powered pulsar model can explain the process of

energy emission released by dipole radiation in a WD, since they share quite similar
aspects 21. In addition, these sources could also be candidates for GW emission,
since the high magnetic ﬁeld can deform the star in a non-symmetrical way, thus
generating a variation in the quadrupolar moment of the star.

Therefore, we consider in this section that SGRs/AXPs are fast-spinning and
magnetized WDs which emit GWs due to the deformation caused by their own
intense magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, using Eq. 10 and adopting κ (cid:39) 10, we calculate the
GW amplitude for the 23 conﬁrmed SGRs/AXPs 47 a, considering these objects as a
very massive WD. To do so, we assume three values of mass and their corresponding
radius, namely, MW D = 1.4M(cid:12) (RW D = 1.0 × 108 cm), 1.2 M(cid:12) (RW D = 6.0 × 108
cm) and 1.0 M(cid:12) (RW D = 7.5 × 108 cm) [see Ref. 48 for further details about the
mass-radius relation].

After estimating the amplitude, we placed them on the sensitivity curves of the
BBO and DECIGO detectors. Figure 5 shows theses results, such that the GW
amplitude is presented as a function of frequency for some SGRs/AXPs. In this
Figure, the bullets stands for MW D = 1.2M(cid:12) and the vertical bars, that crosses the
bullets, stands for 1.0M(cid:12) ≤ MW D ≤ 1.4M(cid:12), from top to bottom.

Notice that some SGRs/AXPs produce GWs with amplitudes that can be de-
tected by BBO and DECIGO. Some of them, for example 1E 1547.0-5408 and SGR
1806-20, could well be detected for the entire mass range considered, while others
would be detected depending on how massive they are.

SGRs/AXPs described as WDs generate GW amplitudes much larger than
SGRs/AXPs described in the magnetar model where they are neutron stars [see
e.g. Refs. 49,50 for details about magnetar model]. This is because WDs have mo-

ments of inertia four orders of magnitude greater than a neutron star. Consequently,
the GW amplitudes generated by these sources as neutron stars are far below the
sensitivity curves of BBO and DECIGO [see Fig. 6]. Therefore, if these space based
instruments detect continuous GWs from these sources, this would corroborate the
model of fast spinning and magnetic WDs.

4. Final Remarks

We investigate two mechanisms - accretion of matter and magnetic deformation -
for the production of gravitational waves in fast-spinning WDs. These uncommon

11

WDs have high rotation and huge magnetic ﬁelds. Also, these stars are considered
in an alternative model to describe SGRs and AXPs, where they are characterized
as rotation-powered WD pulsars.

Then, we ﬁrstly study the following three binary systems: AE Aqr, AR Sco and
RX J0648. For the accretion of matter mechanism, our results show that the AE
Aqr and RX J0648 are good candidates for BBO and DECIGO if they have an
amount of mass accumulated of δm ≥ 10−5M(cid:12), considering 1 year of integration
time and SN R = 8. In contrast, AR Sco is unlikely to be detected because it is
needed a large amount of mass accumulated in the magnetic pole of this WD.

Now, regarding the magnetic deformation mechanism, to emit gravitational ra-
diation with amplitudes that are detectable by BBO, for example, the three binary
systems studied require that the WD has a magnetic ﬁeld above ∼ 109 G. Never-
theless, these WDs are inferred to have magnetic ﬁelds with intensity around two
orders of magnitude smaller. Moreover, we also conclude that gravitational radia-
tion has an irrelevant contribution to the spindown luminosity of these systems for
both mechanism.

Still, taking into account the magnetic deformation mechanism, we investi-
gate the SGRs/AXPs as rotation-powered WD pulsars assigning a mass range
1.0M(cid:12) ≤ MW D ≤ 1.4M(cid:12) for these objects. We conclude that a possible detec-
tion of continuous GWs coming from SGRs/AXPs would be a good indication that
could corroborate the WD pulsar model, as for the neutron stars description, they
are far below the BBO and DECIGO sensitivity curves.
