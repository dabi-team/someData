ABSTRACT.  Implantation  and  subsequent  behaviour  of  heavy  noble  gases  (Ar,  Kr,  Xe)  in  few-layer 
graphene  sheets  and  in  nanodiamonds  is  studied  both  using  computational  methods  and  experimentally 
using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption spectroscopy provides substantial support for the 
Xe-vacancy  (Xe-V)  defect  as  a  main  site  for  Xe  in  nanodiamond.  It  is  shown  that  noble  gases  in  thin 
graphene stacks distort the layers, forming bulges. The energy of an ion placed in between flat graphene 
sheets is notably lower than in domains with high curvature. However, if the ion is trapped in the curved 
domain, considerable additional energy is required to displace it. 

Introduction  

Nanoparticles of sp2- and sp3-hybridised carbon are frequently encountered both in nature and in various 
technologies. Many types of poorly ordered sp2 carbons comprise stacks of few graphene sheets of different 
sizes. Interestingly, natural nanocarbons encountered in some meteorites contain relatively high abundances 
of noble gases (review in Ref. 1). Ion implantation is the most feasible mechanism of incorporation of these 
atoms into nanodiamonds. A peculiar and rather abundant component of noble gases in meteorites - the Q-
component (“Q” stands for “quintessence”) is likely a disordered carbonaceous phase with abundant few-
layers  graphene  stacks.2-6  It  is  suggested  that  noble  gases  reside  between  the  sheets  and  although  the 
mechanism(s) of the gases’ incorporation is not firmly established, their isotopic ratios strongly suggest 
that low energy ion implantation of ionized species was very important. One of the most unusual features 
of the Q-phase is rather strong binding of trapped noble gases (He, Ar, Xe): during step oxidation these 
gases are released only at 450-500 °C, i.e. shortly before burning of the carbon carrier.6 Since atomic radii 
of  heavy  noble  gases  (Kr,  Xe)  exceeds  interlayer  spacing  in  graphene  stacks  present  in  sp2-C  from 
meteorites, the graphene sheets deform, keeping the atom in the bulge. It was suggested that high retention 
capacity is explained by peculiarities of the atomic structure of sites where trapped noble atoms reside.

Ion  implantation  into  nanostructures  attracts  considerable  attention.7  Numerous  studies  address  the 
interaction of ions with single layer graphene8-13, but these works primarily focus on radiation defects in 
single layer graphene or the formation of nanopores, leaving aside thin graphene stacks. Xe implantation 
in  nanodiamond  grains  was  studied  using  in  situ  TEM  and  different  computational  approaches.14-16 
However, direct information about the local environment of noble ions implanted into nanodiamonds and 
various sp2-carbons is very limited. 

In  this  contribution,  we  present  results  of  experimental  and  computational  investigation  of  the  local 
environment  of  Xe,  Kr  and  Ar  ions  implanted  with  energies  below  1500  eV  into  several  types  of 
nanocarbons.  Light  gases  (H  and  He),  and  graphene  stacks  decorated  by  functional  groups  are  briefly 
considered  for  comparative  purposes.  The  paper  is  organized  as  following:  at  first,  we  discuss 
computational modeling of the implantation process and relaxed structures of the noble gas atoms in flat 
and curved graphene stacks obtained by quantum chemistry and then compare theoretical modeling with 
experimental data on the local environment of implanted ions. 

Sample and methods 

Computational methodology 

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the noble gas ion interaction with flat and curved graphene sheets 
were carried out with LAMMPS codes.17. To simulate ion implantation process AIREBO bond-order force 
field, which enables to take into account formation and rupture of chemical bonds and includes additional 
terms to take into account van der Waals interaction between graphene sheets,18 was used to describe C–C 
interaction. The C–Ar and C–Xe interactions were described by the ZBL potential.19 To study the behaviour 
of implanted ions within graphene stacks we applied ReaxFF force field developed especially for C–(He, 
Ne, Ar, Kr) interactions.20 

The initial model of a graphene sheet was 5.03×4.84 nm2 in size and consisted of 960 carbon atoms. On 
this base, two main models of multi-layered graphene (2 and 4 sheets) were built. A few carbon atoms in 
the corner of each sheet model were fixed, and periodic boundary conditions were applied in XY directions. 
Importantly, the sample was free-standing, i.e. no substrate was employed.  

Implantation process was simulated as following. At the initial moment of the time cycle, an ion was created 
with a given kinetic energy above the surface. Initial ion (X, Y) coordinates were chosen randomly but with 
a condition that the distance of the ion from the central axis of the model does not exceed 0.5 nm. Ions were 
directed along the Z axis towards the model at normal incidence. The energy of ions was varied from 20 to 
200 eV with a step of 5 eV, and for each energy value 100 impacts were simulated. To keep the overall 
temperature of the system at 50 K, the Berendsen thermostat was used periodically in accordance with the 
algorithm  proposed  in  Ref.  21:  for  the  first  1.0  ps  the  simulation  was  performed  in  the  microcanonical 
(NVE) ensemble with no temperature control to guarantee a proper development of heat transfer and defect 
formation, then the thermostat was switched on in order to cool the model down to 50 K. In the first part of 
this cycle, the time step was chosen equal to 0.1 fs, and in the second part with the thermostat applied, it 
was increased up to 0.5 fs, so the total duration of one cycle was 10 ps.

To simulate the behaviour of implanted ions within curved graphene stacks, two additional models were 
built. They are based on 2- or 4-layered graphene sheets joined with open semi-nanotubes, i.e. a nanotube 
was cut in two halves by a plane parallel to the main axis. To preserve both flat and curved zones of such 
models during the relaxation, some atoms in each layer were fixed. Dynamic simulations were carried out 
in NVT ensemble at 100, 200 and 300 K; no additional kinetic energy was supplied to the implanted ion. 
The MD simulations were performed on the equipment of the shared research facilities of High Performance 
Computing  resources  at  Lomonosov  Moscow  State  University.22  For  the  visualization  of  models  and 
analysis of simulation results, the software package OVITO was used.23 

The behaviour of Xe and Kr in nanodiamonds was modelled with non-boundary conditions in cubic unit 
cells, which provided distances between diamond particles more than 10 Å to avoid interparticle interaction. 
Nanoparticles were constructed as described in Ref. 24 and allowed to relax. Subsequently, a grain with a 
Xe-V defect was optimized. The Xe-V defects were built by replacing two neighbouring carbon atoms (see 
also  Ref.  14).  For  evaluation  of  local  atomic  geometry  of  Xe(Kr)  in  sp2  carbons  we  performed  DFT 
geometry optimization of Xe(Kr) in two and four sheets of graphene using the plane-wave-pseudopotential 
approach  as  implemented  in  Quantum  ESPRESSO.25  The  core  electrons  are  described  by  the  non-
conserving Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials.26 In order to account for the van der Waals 
interactions  between  graphene  sheets  the  revised  Vydrov-Van  Voorhis  non-local  correlation  functional 
(rVV10)27 was applied. The convergence criterion for self-consistent energy is taken to be 10−6 Ry. A Γ-
point approximation was applied for the supercell of 6×6 graphene sheets. The kinetic energy cut-off for 
the electron wave functions is set at 100 Ry and the augmented charge density cut-off is set to 400 Ry. The 
ion of interest was introduced in between the layers and allowed to relax. 

To  interpret  experimental  XANES  spectra  quantum  chemistry  calculations  were  performed  to  provide 
initial structural models of Xe(Kr). The Quickstep module of the CP2K program suite with a dual basis of 
localized Gaussians and plane waves was employed.28 The plane wave cutoff was 400 Ry, appropriate for 
employed GDH pseudopotentials.26 The localized basis set of double-zeta plus polarization (DZVP) was 
quality optimized to reduce the basis set superposition errors.29 The calculations were performed using the 
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional.30 A conjugation gradient (CG) geometry 
optimization  with  SCF  convergence  criteria  of  5.0×10–7  a.u.  was  used.  Atomic  configurations  were 
considered  converged  when  forces  were  less  than  4.5×10-4  hartree×bohr-1.  Theoretical  XANES  spectra 
were calculated with FDMNES code31 using the modelled local environment of the Xe(Kr) atoms. 

Experimental 

Two  sets  of  nanodiamonds  with  well-defined  grain  sizes  (5  and  40  nm),  nanocrystalline  diamond  film 
(UNCD,  see  Ref.  32  for  detail),  graphite,  and  technical  soot  were  implanted  using  Kr/Xe  asymmetric 
capacitive  discharge  at  a  dedicated  setup  equipped  with  an  2  MHz  RF  generator  at  IPCE  RAS.  The 
nanodiamond samples were either embedded into high purity oxygenless copper or placed into high purity 
graphite boats for Atomic Emission spectroscopy; Si and In substrate were also employed in some runs. 
Pressure of target gases (Xe or Kr) was between 3 and 6 Pa. At first, the samples were pre-sputtered under 
bias  of  -200-300  V  for  10 min.  Then  the  generator  anode  current  was  increased  and  the  samples  were 
implanted under bias of -1420-1490 V for Xe and ~-1000 V for Kr. We recall that considerable fraction of 

 
 
Accepted to Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 2021, DOI: 10.1039/D1CP02600C 
ions in the sheath possesses energies smaller than the maximum in eV, numerically equal to the magnitude 
of the bias in Volts.33 The maximum energy of the ions is comparable with previous studies34,35 and the 
penetration depth (1-3 nm) of the impinging ions was less than a grain diameter in all nanodiamond samples.  

The selection of the ion fluence is a controversial task. For the XANES measurements, a relatively high 
concentration of the target ion (Xe/Kr) is desirable. At the same time, nanoparticles can be strongly heated 
or even completely destroyed by a single ion14-16 and thus sputtering of upper layers of nanograins will 
occur. In our experiments the fluence was between 5-8×1015 at/cm2 with a dose rate of ~8×1012 at/cm2·sec. 
The  temperature  of  the  samples  was  not  controlled,  but  was  certainly  less  than  the  indium  melting 
temperature (156 °C). To preserve the implanted layer from dispersion, the samples were covered by an 
SPI®  cellulose  acetate  replicating  film,  hardened  by  acetone  immediately  after  the  opening  of  the 
implantation vessel to the atmosphere.  

The XANES measurements  were performed at  the ROBL beamline at  ESRF.36  Holders with  implanted 
samples were placed on a dedicated Grazing-incidence setup. The measurements at the Xe-L3 and Kr-K-
edges were performed in fluorescence mode by using 12-elements Ge detector. The estimated incident flux 
was 2×1011 ph/sec at the Kr K-edge and 1.6×109 at the Xe L3 edge. Due to very low concentrations of 
implanted  ions  only  near-edge  spectra  were  recorded;  up  to  20  repeated  scans  were  acquired  for  each 
sample. Data treatment was performed using Athena software.37 

Results 

Modeling of Ar/Kr/Xe behavior in flat and curved graphene stacks 

At  energies  of  the  incident  Xe  ion  below  ~60  eV  it  is  reflected  by  the  graphene  stacks,  but  leads  to 
displacement of some carbon atoms. At ~60 eV the recoils may form links between the layers. A Xe ion 
penetrates the upper layer of a graphene stack at a relatively high energy of ~70 eV for bi-graphene and 
~65 eV for 4-layer stack. The higher energy required for penetration into the bigraphene is likely explained 
by greater flexibility of thinner stack and, consequently, a larger degree of bending, which dissipates the 
energy  of  the  incident  ion.  With  increasing  energy  the  penetration  probability  increases,  e.g.,  at  80  eV 
18(26)% of ions penetrate the bi- (4-)layer graphene, at 90 eV – 55%, at 100 eV – 90% and at energies 
exceeding 110 eV the upper layer is always penetrated. At yet higher energies, the ion also passes through 
the second graphene sheet thus leaving the bigraphene sample or is trapped in between layers of thicker 
stacks. 

It is  worth noting that energy dissipation occurs more slowly for bigraphene model  in  comparison with 
thicker stacks; such an effect is expected in 2D nanostructures because of their reduced dimensionality.7 
Figure 1 shows snapshots of bi- and 4-layer graphene stacks after a single impact of a 100 eV Ar ion. The 
ion  implanted  between  the  two  uppermost  layers  induces  distortion  in  the  3rd  and  4th  layers  and  the 
magnitude of the deformation decreases faster in the 4-layer stack. 

  Due  to  relatively  high  residual  energy,  an  ion  that  has  penetrated  the  upper  graphene  sheet  starts  to 
migrate rapidly in the gap between the layers. In the absolute majority of cases, the ion diffuses away from 
a vacancy-type defects formed during the implantation process. Therefore, calculation of the most stable

configuration of trapped Xe is effectively reduced to a “static” case, which is discussed below together with 
experimental XANES data. Representative stable configurations of Xe(Kr) in flat bi- and 4-layer graphene 
stacks  optimized  using  the  DFT  Quantum  Espresso  package  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  For  Xe  the  closest 
neighbours are at 2.99-3.03 Å in bilayer and at 2.91-2.96 Å in four-layers stack. For Kr the values are 2.79-
2.88 Å and 2.74-2.82 Å, respectively. Experimentally measured interlayer spacing in graphene stacks in 
carbon  extracted  from  a  meteorite  is  approx.  3.4-3.5  Å.6  As  shown  by  the  simulation  results,  the 
emplacement of a large ion in between the sheets leads to the formation of a bulge. The heavier the ion is, 
the larger this bulge becomes, and, correspondingly, the energy change induced by the ion implantation 
especially  in  the  case  of  heavy  Xe  and  Kr  ions  increases.  This  fact  indicates  that  the  movement  of  an 
implanted ion in the stack is hindered, especially in in the case of heavy Xe and Kr ions.

  Since the current work is partly driven by cosmochemical applications, it is important to consider curved 
graphene stacks, which are abundant in carbonaceous residues from meteorites.2-6 Several possible models, 
based either on short two-wall nanotubes of different radii and lengths, or on nested nanotubes with a closed 
end and a graphene sheet, were studied. The simulations were run both with fixed and free edges for all 
types of models. The main effect of an implanted ion on the CNT structure was similar to that of the flat 
graphene stack: as a result of the implantation, the nanotube was significantly deformed, as shown in Fig. 
3a, b. Because of different model structure and the number of atoms, direct comparison of energy change 
between planar and curved models is difficult. However, our DFT calculations show that for small models 
the implantation of noble gas ion into a curved structure leads to a higher excess energy than into a planar 
one (Table 1). This excess energy ΔE was calculated for the model of flat bilayer graphene and two-wall 
CNT  of  similar  size  as  the  difference  between  the  DFT  total  energies  of  the  particular  model  with  an 
implanted  atom  and  the  model  with  the  atom  outside.  Its  positive  values  imply  that  the  implantation  is 
energetically unfavourable and requires a large amount of energy, so it can be considered as a measure of 
the graphene/CNT deformation. For example, for a two-walled CNT with the outer diameter of ~1 nm and 
the length of 1.5 nm the excess energy due to the Xe implantation amounts to ~7.3 eV, while for planar 
bilayer graphene of similar size it is equal to ~5.9 eV. Similar effect was found Taken together, the DFT 
modelling  results  indicate  that  curved  graphene  structures  are  energetically  less  favourable  for  the 
accommodation of large ions in comparison with the flat ones, see Table 1.

MD calculations carried out for the larger model showed that the stress induced by an implanted ion is 
redistributed over the whole model. Therefore, an additional, relatively large model of 4-layered graphene 
with planar and curved regions was built on the base of joined graphene stacks and CNTs with a diameter 
of 1.3 nm (Fig. 4). In order to prevent the model transformation during the relaxation, some carbon atoms 
on the edges were fixed. Then the motion of an implanted ion initially placed between layers in the centre 
of the flat and curved regions (Fig. 4 a and b, respectively) was studied at steady-state conditions with NVT 
ensemble. 

Fig. 4. An Ar ion in the planar (A) and curved (B) regions of the 4-layer graphene model after the 
relaxation (the x-axis directed to the right, see text). 

MD simulations run at 300 K demonstrated that the ion placed in the planar region is able to move in the 
interlayer space, for instance, it can go to the leftmost part of the model (Fig. 4a). The situation changes 
drastically, when the ion is placed in the curved region (Fig. 4b). In this case, it just oscillates near the 
lowest point with a relatively small amplitude; the fate of the implant depends on the ion mass: relatively 
heavy  Kr  ions  are  effectively  trapped  in  the  dip,  whereas  lighter  ions  like  Ar  may  still  leave  it.  Fig.  5 
demonstrates the dependencies of the x-coordinate of implanted ions with time

vacancy. 

during our simulations. As one can see, the Ar ion readily moves in the flat region, but not in the curved 
one (blue vs. purple lines in Fig. 5a), while the movement of the larger Kr ion is limited and demonstrates 
a  similar  pattern  in  both  regions  (Fig.  5b).  In  long  simulation  runs  the  Kr  ion  may,  however,  jump  to 
neighbouring positions being in the flat region (see the  right end of the blue line in Fig. 5b), but is still 
immobile in the curved one. One can explain this result by considering p-orbitals of carbon atoms: in planar 
graphene they are directed perpendicular to the sheet, whereas in curved graphene or CNTs these orbitals 
are inclined.38 As a result, the electron density distribution in concave curved graphene regions becomes 
higher, and additional kinetic energy is required to overcome the barrier. The height of this barrier depends 
on the size and curvature of the model as well as the ion type. According to our simulations with the ReaxFF 
it is in order of few tenths of eV. Due to the same reason if the ion nevertheless manages to leave the curved 
region, it does not readily return back and remains in the flat part. 

Interestingly,  if  we  consider  a  noble  gas  ion  in  the  vicinity  of  a  (pre-existing)  carbon  vacancy, 
movements  of  this  ion  are  quite  limited  and  the  ion  prefers  to  stay  near  the  defect.  This  behaviour  is 
illustrated with green curves in Fig. 5 corresponding to the movement of ions implanted near the vacancy 
in the curved region. For the larger Kr ion the dependencies remain almost the same, while the behaviour 
of the lighter Ar ion change significantly (compare purple and green lines in Fig. 5a). Taken together with 
the results given above, we conclude that although the placement of a noble gas ion in between curved 
graphene sheets is energetically more expensive than the position in a flat region, if the ion is nevertheless 
getting into the curved region, it will likely stay there. The trapping effect is more pronounced when the 
curved sheets are defective. 

Although  the  present  study  mainly  focus  on  medium-to-heavy  ions,  for  comparative  purposes  it  is 
instructive to consider also hydrogen and helium. Impacts of low-energy He ions and H ions/radicals on 
graphene were simulated in some DFT39 and MD7,10,13,40 calculations. In general, due to smaller size and 
mass,  helium  ions  are  more  prone  to  backscattering  at  lower  energies  and  easier  penetrates  through 
graphene sheets is sufficient energy is provided. As a result, the probability to find an implanted He ion in 
the bi-layered graphene is substantially lower than for Ar ions (in the energy range when the penetration is 

 
 
Accepted to Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 2021, DOI: 10.1039/D1CP02600C 
possible). Moreover, implanted He atoms do not induce significant deformation of the graphene stack: the 
excess energy for He in flat be-graphene is ~1.2 eV, which is much less than for heavier noble gas atoms.  

Although hydrogen is not a noble gas, it is important to discuss its behaviour, in particular, as a kind of a 
bridge  from  ideal  “clean”  graphene  stacks  to  more  realistic  case  of  graphene  decorated  with  functional 
groups. In contrast to chemically inert noble gas atoms, hydrogens are reactive and tend to form chemical 
bonds  with  carbon  atoms.40,41  When  neutralized  atom  enters  the  interlayer  space  it  interacts  with 
neighboring C atoms forming a C–H bond and highly localised site for the implant. The subsequent change 
in the hybridization of the C atom from sp2 to sp3 induces local deformation of the graphene sheet near the 
adsorption site (Fig. 6).  

Fig. 6. Final position of a hydrogen ion implanted in bi-graphene. 

Graphene stacks discussed above represent  an important  case of chemically  pure monoelemental 2D 
material.  However,  graphene  sheets  in  natural  environments  are  at  least  partly  decorated  by  various 
functional groups. Remarkable richness of possible functional groups drives comprehensive study of even 
the most important atomic configurations far beyond limits of the current study, but some hints of possible 
influence of the functionalization on behavior of implanted gases are presented below. 

In case of flat and curved graphenes, many functional groups destroy the sp2 hybridization of C atoms, 
resulting in local change of physical properties.42 To analyze eventual influence of surface groups on our 
results,  additional  MD  calculations  with  AIREBO  force  field  were  performed  for  the  larger  4-layered 
graphene model. The upper graphene sheet was covered with H atoms (surface coverage is ~1%), resulting 
in formation of surface CH groups, in which C atoms become sp3 hybridized. As a result of the relaxation, 
an implanted Ar ion stays close to the site with the C–H groups (Fig. 7). Functional groups on graphenes 
can be considered as defects and thus influence preferential positions of implanted ions. For the particular 
case of hydrogen studied here, the effect is smaller than in the case of vacancies. However, adatoms on 
graphene  sheets  (including  cases  with  large  curvature  such  and  CNTs)  show  different  behavior,  for 
example, oxygen may be located above the C-C bond forming epoxy group or, at higher concentrations, 
several epoxy groups may convert to ethers, breaking underlying C-C bond.43-46 In the latter case the sheet 
deformation is more pronounced and extensive and the implanted ion may migrate to the relevant site. In 
particular, in Ref. 6 it was shown that that upon H2O2 oxidation of meteoritic carbon, the noble gases are 
retained  in  the  sequence  Xe<Ar«He,  while  after  HNO3  the  sequence  changes  to  He«Xe<Ar.  Large 
deformation of graphene sheets by adatoms and functional groups  serves a plausible explanation of this 
behavior.

Experimental XANES spectra of Xe in nanocarbons 

Xe in nanodiamonds 

Upon suitable annealing, xenon ions driven into bulk diamond by ion implantation may form stable defects 
responsible  for  several  lines  in  photoluminescence  spectra.47,48  According  to  computational  studies,  the 
most stable atomic configuration of a large ion (X) in diamond lattice is an ion-vacancy complex, commonly 
denoted as X-V. According to several independent works the Xe-V defect is the most stable configuration 
for this impurity in diamond.14,16,49,50 However, experimental confirmation of this model are yet lacking, 
since  detailed  investigations  of  Zeeman  splitting  and  polarization  dependence  of  photoluminescence  of 
known Xe-related defects do not allow unambiguous selection of a defect model.51,52  

Figure 8a shows a diamond lattice with a Xe-V complex as obtained by QuantumEspresso modelling.14 
The nearest C neighbours are at 2.17 Å (for a 2 nm grain), which is very close to 2.15 Å obtained with DFT 
for the defect in bulk diamond44, but somewhat smaller than 2.25 Å obtained for the Xe-V in a nanodiamond 
grain with size of 3.9 nm.16 The difference between values obtained for nanosized grains might be due to

different assumptions of the surface structure of the grains: H-terminated surfaces were used in Ref. 14, 
whereas  calculations  in  Ref.  16  were  made  for  a  cuboctahedron  grain  with  different  types  of  surface 
reconstruction of {100} and {111} faces. 

Comparison  of experimental XANES spectra of  Xe implanted into nanodiamonds with  sizes 4-5 nm 
with calculated spectrum shows that the Xe-V model is a plausible possibility (Fig. 8b). A small difference 
between the position of absorption features in experimental and calculated spectra indicates that in the real 
sample  the  distances  between  Xe  and  surrounding  carbon  ions  are  slightly  smaller,  than  in  the  model. 
Interestingly,  in  bulk  diamond  only  a  rather  small  (~10%)  fraction  of  implanted  Xe  ions  forms  stable 
luminescing complexes (presumably, Xe-V) and annealing to temperature of at least 800 °C is required to 
anneal radiation damage and drive the implant to stable lattice position.47,48 However, the heat released in 
the  interaction  of  the  implanted  ion  with  a  nanodiamond  grain14-16  might  be  sufficient  to  induce  lattice 
reconstruction and formation of the Xe-V. Our attempt to observe room temperature photoluminescence of 
Xe-related defects using 405 nm excitation was not successful, but it is possible that employed ion fluence 
was excessive (see dependence of the Xe-defects luminescence from ion fluence in Ref. 52)  

The model for isostructural Kr-V defect was constructed, the nearest C atoms are at 2.1 Å. In contrast to 
the situation with Xe, experimental and calculated XANES spectra of implanted krypton differ markedly 
(Fig.  8c).  Except  clearly  observable  White  Line  (a  sharp  feature  above  the  Kr  absorption  edge),  the 
experimental spectrum is rather featureless. Although some similarity with the calculated spectrum can be 
recognised (sharp white line, a hump at 14340 eV), the comparison is rather poor. A plausible explanation 
is that krypton in nanodiamond does not have a single well-defined site, instead several configurations are 
present; superposition of their contributions leads to smearing of experimental spectrum. 

Somewhat surprisingly, the Xe environment in ultrananocrystalline diamond film markedly differs from 
that in nanodiamond, instead its XANES spectrum resembles that for Xe in graphite, see Figure 9a. From 
the structural point of view, UNCD consists of elongated diamond crystallites, enveloped into thin (few 
nm)  graphite-like  sheath,  but  volumetrically  the  diamond  phase  dominates.  Whereas  unambiguous 
explanation is yet lacking it is possible that loss of energy of impinging Xe ions during passage through the 
graphitic shell prevents implantation into the diamond crystallites and/or damaged region in the diamonds 
resembles graphitic carbon. Diamond samples retain a smaller amount of Xe in comparison with graphitic 
C, which serves as indirect support of scenario suggested for the UNCD film. Apparently, higher density 
and displacement energy of diamond in comparison with graphite both prevents incorporation of ions with 
small energies and complicates the formation of stable atomic configuration for implanted ones.

  Except  H-termination  model  in  Quantum  Espresso,  no  specific  surface  functional  groups  on 
nanodiamond grains were explicitly taken into account in this work. In case of Xe implantation into a grain, 
the ion slows down with small deviations from initial trajectory.16 When implanted into central part of a 
grain, the ion will be surrounded by bulk-like diamond and influence of surface groups will be negligible. 
We recall here that even in nanodiamonds as small as 1.6 nm and covered with various functional groups, 
silicon-vacancy  defects  still  serve  as  efficient  photon  emitters  implying  close  similarity  of  their  local 
environment with bulk diamond.53 Although the Xe-V defect may be formed at any depth in a nanodiamond 
grain,16  according  to  quantum  chemistry  modelling  the  energy  of  the  Xe-V  formation  in  H-terminated 
diamond grain is only slightly dependent on the grain size, but moderately decreases towards periphery of 
the grain.14 This  suggests  that upon annealing  Xe ions  may migrate towards  grain  surface or extended 
defects. Subsequently, pronounced graphitisation of a nanodiamond surface – here the UNCD may serve 
as  an  end-member  with  fully  graphitised  surface  –  may  influence  stability  of  the  Xe-V  defects  and 
significant  fraction  of  Xe  may  leave  the  sp3  core.  However,  close  similarity  of  experimental  XANES 
spectrum with calculated “bulk-like” Xe-V model indicates that in case of nanodiamond grains subjected 
to standard acidic cleaning the effect of functional groups is minor. 

XANES spectra of Xe in graphene stacks 

Figure 9a shows experimental XANES spectra of Xe implanted in polycrystalline graphite, carbon soot and 
Ultrananocrystalline  diamond  (UNCD);  for  comparison,  spectra  of  Xe  ion  placed  in  bi-  and  4-layer 
graphene stack calculated using Artemis software37 for configurations shown in Fig. 2 are also shown. The 
calculated spectra of Xe in 2- and 4-layer graphene stacks (Fig. 9b), and of Xe ion in the direct vicinity of 
a vacancy in one of the graphene sheets are rather similar, which is explained by the rapid decrease of a 
cross-section  of  photoelectron-carbon  ion  interaction  with  distance,  therefore,  immediate  neighbours 
dominate the backscattering signal. The experimental spectrum of Xe in graphite and in UNCD film are 
similar to the calculated ones for graphene stacks, but, as well as the nanodiamond case discussed above, 
the Xe-C distances in the studied samples are shorter than in the modelled geometry, likely reflecting larger 
relaxation  of  real  nanocarbons  and  possible  surface  reconstruction,  not  fully  encompassed  in  our 
calculations.  

Carbon soot loses Xe under the beam, which is manifested as a gradual decrease of the absorption, but this 
process reaches saturation after several tens of minutes under the X-ray beam. Possibly Xe site also evolves 
during the initial stages of photon beam irradiation. The resulting spectrum of Xe in soot markedly differs 
from that in graphite. Such discrepancy is not very surprising, since the structure of carbon soot is very 
complex and although graphene stacks of variable sizes and thickness are present, a significant sample-
dependent fraction represents highly disordered carbon. Subsequently, both implanted Xe may occupy a 
rich variety of sites and a simple model of an ion in between two (or four) graphene sheets fails to explain 
all the complexity.

This  work  presents  results  of  combined  computational  and  experimental  investigation  of  low  energy 
implantation process and subsequent behaviour of heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) in few-layer graphene 
stacks and nanodiamonds. Behaviour of He and H as well as influence of functional groups on behavior of 
implanted ions are briefly considered. Good correspondence between calculated and experimental X-ray 
absorption  spectra  of  implanted  Xe  is  an  important  support  of  hypothesis  that  a  Xe-V  (Xe-vacancy) 
complex  is  the  most  stable  site  for  Xe  ion  in  diamond  lattice;  for  Xe  in  nanodiamond  this  was 
experimentally shown for the first time. Surprisingly, krypton behaviour is more erratic; possibly several 
sites  may  form  during  the  implantation  and  thus  experimental  XANES  spectra  average  over  several 
configurations. 

  Xe implanted into Ultrananocrystalline diamond film is likely expelled from the diamond phase into the 
graphitic envelopes. Comparison of experimental data and computational results indicate that noble gases 
introduced in thin graphitic stacks deform neighbouring graphenes, forming bulges. Formation of the bulge 
appears to be energetically unfavourable for thick stacks due to interlayer interaction, thus explaining why 
ordered meteoritic graphite is often devoid of the noble gases.54 The diffusivity of implanted ions in flat 
and  curved  graphene  stacks  markedly  depends  on  their  curvature.  Whereas  incorporation  into  the  flat 
regions is energetically more favourable, if the ion is trapped in the concave region, significant energy is 
required  to  expel  it  from  the  trap.  The  trapping  effect  is  more  pronounced  when  the  curved  sheets  are 
defective. Thus, localization of noble gases in highly curved domains of thin graphene stacks present in the 
carbonaceous phase from meteorites may explain their high release temperatures.
