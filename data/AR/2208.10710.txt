(Dated: August 24, 2022)

Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, the inﬂuence of mass asymmetry and
the isospin eﬀect on the production of exotic actinides have been investigated systematically. The
isotopic yields populate in multinucleon transfer reactions of 48Ca, 86Kr, 136Xe, 238U bombarding on
248Cm are analyzed and compared to the available experimental data. Systematics on the production
of unknown actinides from Ac to Lr via the available stable elements on the earth (from Ar to U)
as projectiles-induced reactions with 232Th, 238U and 248Cm are investigated thoroughly. Potential
energy surface and total kinetic energy distribution for the reaction system are calculated and can
be used to predict the production cross-section trends. It is found that the heavier projectile leads
to the wider isotopic chain distribution for the same target. The heavier target-based reactions
prefer to produce plenty of exotic actinides through both mechanisms of deep-inelastic and quasi-
ﬁssion reactions. Isospin relaxation plays a crucial role in the colliding process, resulting in actinide
isotopic distribution tends to shift to the drip lines. Massive new actinides have been predicted at
the level of nanonbarn to millibarn. The optimal projectile-target combinations and beam energies
were proposed for the forthcoming experiments.

INTRODUCTION

In past decades, a number of new exotic actinides have
been identiﬁed in laboratories all over the world. There
are ﬁfteen elements in the actinide region with the charge
number Z = 89-103.
In the actinide range, practically
these nuclides were produced by such methods: heavy-ion
fusion-evaporation reactions (FE), projectile fragmenta-
tion (PF), light-particle reactions (LP), neutron capture
reactions (NC), heavy-ion transfer reactions (TR), deep-
inelastic(DI), thermonuclear tests (TNT) and radioac-
tive decay (RD). Up to now, the most neutron-deﬁcient
isotopes for each actinides from Ac to Lr are 205Ac,
207Th, 211Pa, 214U, 219Np, 228Pu, 223Am, 233Cm, 233Bk,
237Cf, 240Es, 241Fm, 244Md, 250No and 253Lr, respec-
tively. Among them, 223Am and 233Bk have been pro-
duced in multinucleon transfer reactions 48Ca + 248Cm.
Apart from that, the rest of them have been synthesized
by heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reactions. Hitherto, the
most neutron-rich isotope for each actinides from Ac to
Lr are 236Ac, 238Th, 239Pa, 242U, 244Np, 247Pu, 247Am,
251Cm, 251Bk, 256Cf, 257Es, 259Fm, 260Md, 260No and
266Lr, respectively. Among them, 238Th, 239Pa, 244Np,
260Md and 260No were produced through multinucleon
transfer or deep-inelastic reactions. 236Ac was produced
in projectile fragmentation (PF) reaction. PF reactions

products are still not so close to the drip line.
247Am, 256Cf and 259Fm were created via light-particles
reactions. 247Pu, 251Cm and 257Es were produced in neu-

tron capture reactions. 260No was identiﬁed in alpha de-
cay chain based fusion-evaporation reactions. The syn-
thesis information of the most neutron-rich and proton-
rich actinide isotopes are listed in Table I, including the
based method, laboratory, country, and year.

Above all, we can see that FE is still the most promis-
ing method to create new nuclides nearby the proton drip
line. Furthermore, MNT reaction also may approach the
proton drip line, particularly after very proton-rich ac-
tinides 223Am and 233Bk were identiﬁed by Devaraja et
al. at GSI. Actually, MNT reactions have been used to
synthesize very neutron-rich actinides, e.g., 238Th in 18O
+ 238U with incident energy 60A MeV, 239Pa in 18O +
238U with incident energy 50A MeV, 244Np in 136Xe +
244Pu with incident energy 835 MeV, based on quasi-
ﬁssion mechanism (nucleons transfer from target to pro-
jectile). 260Md and 260No were discovered in MNT reac-
tions of 22Ne + 254Es, 18O + 244Pu, respectively, based
on deep-inelastic mechanism (nucleons transfer from pro-
jectile to target). Compare to the synthesis of proton-
rich actinides, the neutron-rich ones are more diﬃcult to
produce and identify because of the β− decay, which is
hardly distinguished and identiﬁed by the data capture
and detection system state of the art. There are limi-
tations of available projectile-target material in mecha-
nisms of FE, LP, and PF reactions. With particle iden-
tiﬁcation technique development, MNT reactions might
be considered the only method that could be used to
produce very neutron-rich actinides, especially for the
transuranium elements. It was well known that the MNT
reactions have such advantages that fragment with a wide
mass region owing to broad excitation functions in the
transfer process. Therefore, more insightful theoretical

 
 
 
 
 
 
and experimental studies of the reaction mechanism are
required to make precise predictions for the probability
of MNT products in such reactions.

Since the 1970s, MNT reactions of actinide-based tar-
gets with projectiles O, Ca, Kr, Xe, U, and Cm have
been used to synthesize massive unknown actinides with
in the laboratories GSI[1] and
available cross-section,
Berkely[2, 3]. Based on these available experimental
data, it motivates us to explore the inﬂuence of mass
asymmetry and isospin eﬀect on the production cross-
section of exotic actinides in MNT reactions.

In this work, the selection of projectiles as Ar to U
induced MNT reactions with the combination of targets
232Th, 238U, 248Cm are calculated with the DNS model.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the entrance chan-
nel eﬀect and isospin relaxation on the production cross-
sections of actinide products in actinides-based MNT re-
actions. The article is organized as follows: In Sec. II we
give a brief description of the DNS model. Calculated re-
sults and discussions are presented in Sec. III. Summary
is concluded in Sec. IV.

Wsur(E1, J1, s). The Jmax is the maximal angular mo-
mentum at grazing collisions. The capture cross-section
is evaluated by σcap = π¯h2(2J + 1)/(2µEc.m.)T (Ec.m., J)
The T (Ec.m., J) is the transmission probability of the
projectile-target nuclei overcoming the Coulomb barrier
to form a composite system and calculated by the Hill-
Wheeler formula in Refs.[33]. The µ is the reduced mass
of relative motion.

The dynamical multinucleon transfer reactions are de-
scribed as a diﬀusion process, in which the resulting dis-
tribution probability is obtained by solving a set of mas-
ter equations numerically in the potential energy sur-
face of the DNS. The time evolution of the distribution
probability P (Z1, N1, E1, β, t) for fragment 1 with pro-
ton number Z1, neutron number N1, excitation energy
E1, quadrupole deformation β are described by the fol-
lowing master equations:

is taken over all possible proton and neutron numbers
that fragment (Z
1) may take, but only one nucleon
transfer is considered in the model with the relations
Z
1 = N1 ± 1. The transfer proba-
bility is smoothed with the barrier distribution, which
is taken as the asymmetry Gaussian form of f (B) =
N exp (cid:2)−((B − Bm)/∆)2(cid:3) with the normalization con-
1
stant satisfying the unity relation (cid:82) f (B)dB = 1. The
quantities Bm and ∆ are evaluated by Bm = (BC +BS)/2
and ∆ = (BC − BS)/2, respectively. The BC and BS are
the Coulomb barrier at waist-to-waist orientation and the
minimum barrier with varying the quadrupole deforma-
tion parameters of colliding partners.

The motion of nucleons in the interacting potential is
governed by the single-particle Hamiltonian. The excited
DNS opens a valence space in which the valence nucleons
have a symmetrical distribution around the Fermi sur-
face. Only the particles at the states within the valence
space are actively for nucleon transfer. The transition
probability is related to the local excitation energy and
nucleon transfer, which is microscopically derived from
the interaction potential in valence space as described in
[34, 35].

The memory time τmem and interaction element V can

neutron transition coeﬃcient.

The local excitation energy is determined by the dissi-
pation energy from the relative motion and the potential
energy surface of the DNS as

ε∗(t) = Ediss(t) − (U ({α, t}) − U ({αEN})) .

The entrance channel quantities {αEN} include the pro-

rameters and orientation angles being ZP, NP, ZT, NT,
R, βP, βT, θP, θT for projectile and target nuclei with the
symbols of P and T , respectively. The symbol α denotes
the quantities of fragments of Z1, N1, Z2, N2, R, β1, β2,
θ1, θ2 . The interaction time τint is obtained from the
deﬂection function method [36]. The energy dissipated
into the DNS increases exponentially [33].

The potential energy surface (PES) of the DNS is eval-

uated by

Where, the Qgg derived by the negative binding energies
of the fragments (Zi, Ni) were calculated by liquid drop
model plus shell correction[37]. The θi denotes the angles
between the collision orientations and the symmetry axes
of the deformed nuclei. VC and VN were calculated by
the Wong formular[38] and double-folding potential[39],
respectively. Vdef (t) is the deformation energy of DNS
at the reaction time t. The evolutions of quadrupole
deformations of projectile-like and target-like fragments
undergo from the initial conﬁguration as

β(cid:48)
T(t) = βT exp(−t/τβ) + β1[1 − exp(−t/τβ)],

with the deformation relaxation is τβ = 4 × 10−21 s.

The total kinetic energy (TKE) of the primary frag-

ment is evaluated by

T KE(A1) = Ec.m. + Qgg(A1) − Ediss(A1),

(10)

where Qgg = MP + MT − MPLF − MTLF and Ec.m. be-
ing the incident energy in the center of mass frame. The
mass MP, MT, MPLF and MTLF correspond to projectile,
target, projectile-like fragment and target-like fragment,
respectively. The E1 and J1 are the excitation energy
and the angular momentum for the fragment (Z1, N1).
The survival probability Wsur of each fragment is evalu-
ated with a statistical approach based on the Weisskopf
evaporation theory [40], in which the excited primary
fragments are cooled in evaporation channels s(Zs, Ns)
by γ-rays, light particles (neutrons, protons, α, etc) in
competition with the binary ﬁssion.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In heavy-ion damping collisions, colliding partners
overcome the Coulomb barrier, and kinetic energy of rel-
ative motion transforms rapidly dissipates into internal
excitation of a dinuclear system at contact conﬁguration.
The interaction potential distribution to distance, stick-
ing time to impact parameter and internal excitation en-
ergy to reaction time for three diﬀerent mass asymmetry
systems of 48Ca + 232Th (η = 0.171), 124Sn + 232Th (η
= 0.348) and 204Hg + 232Th (η = 0.468) at incident en-
ergy Ec.m. = 1.1×VB are presented in Fig.1. The interac-
tion potential is a combination of Coulomb potential and
nuclide-nuclide potential, which is calculated as a func-
tion of the nuclear surface distance between two heavy
partners. In panel (a), One can see that Coulomb barri-
ers of head-on collision systems are about 185 MeV, 445
MeV and 650 MeV, corresponding to 48Ca + 232Th (solid

232Th (dash-dot blue line), respectively. The potential
pocket locates nearby contact points almost.

The sticking time of the collision system is derived from
the deﬂection function, shown as a function of angul-
momentum (impact parameter), which decreases expo-
nentially with increasing angular momentum, shown in
panel (b). Generally, the mass asymmetry of collision
systems is smaller, and their sticking time is longer, due
to the small mass asymmetry system having smaller po-
tential energy and potential pocket. The internal excita-
tion energy dissipating in the dinuclear system increases
exponentially with increasing evolution time, as shown
in panel (c). The existence of the pocket in the entrance
channel is crucial for the compound nucleus formation in
fusion reactions, which is the input physical quantity in
calculating capture cross-section. According to Fig. 1, it
was found that there are few MeV potential pockets for
the heavy systems, because of the strong Coulomb repul-
sion between two colliding partners with Z1Z2 = 1860.
The lighter collision systems own the deeper potential
pocket relatively. The deeper potential pocket collision
system led to a longer reaction time relatively.

Nucleons are transferred between the collision partners
resulting in the internal degree of freedom characterizing
the nuclear states encountering a rapid rearrangement
along the valley line in potential energy surface (PES)
as well as dissipating kinetic energy and angular momen-
tum. The calculation of multi-dimensional adiabatic PES
for the heavy nuclear system is a quite complex physical
problem, until now it is still an open problem. PES and
driving potential of head-on collisions of 48Ca, 124Sn and
204Hg bombardment on 232Th and 248Cm are calculated
by Eq. (6) as a diabetic type with the ﬁxed surface dis-
tance, shown in Fig. 2. The solid black, dash red, dash-

The valley trajectories in PES are shown as a function
of proton number and neutron number, shown in Fig.

In order to make compar-
sion for collision systems with diﬀerent mass asymme-
try, we use ∆Udr(Z, N ) = Udr(Z, N ) - Udr(ZT, NT) to
represent the driving potential change trend. For 48Ca
+ 232Th and 48Ca + 248Cm, the pockets locate at A1
= 240 (Z1 = 94, N1 = 146; Z2 = 42, N2 = 64), at
A1 = 254(Z1 = 100, N1 = 156; Z2 = 16, N2 = 24), tar-
gets pick up four protons and four neutrons. For 124Sn
+ 232Th, a pocket locates at A1 = 250(Z1 = 98, N1 =
152; Z2 = 42, N2 = 64), target gets four protons and
four neutrons. For 204Hg + 232Th, the pocket locates at
A1 = 250 − 266(Z1 = 98 − 104, N1 = 152 − 162; Z2 =
72 − 66, N2 = 114 − 104), target gets 8-14 protons and
10-20 neutrons. For 124Sn + 248Cm, two pockets locate
at A1 = 250(Z1 = 98, N1 = 152; Z2 = 42, N2 = 64)
and = 266(Z1 = 104, N1 = 162; Z2 = 36, N2 = 54).

picks up fourteen protons and twenty neutrons. Neu-
tron subshell numbers (N = 152, 162) play a crucial
role in PES. The DNS fragments towards mass asym-
metric location release negative energy, which combined
with interaction potential contribute to nucleons trans-
fer. From a purely Coulomb perspective, the removal
of protons from the target to the projectile is unfavor-
able. The spectra exhibit a gaussian-like distribution for
potential value belonging to each atomic number. The
valley trajectory in the PES is close to the β-stability
line. Therefore, we solve the master equations with the
PES to get the all-formed fragments probability for these
collision systems with diﬀerent mass asymmetry and dy-
namical quadrupole deformations. From these PES, we
can roughly predict the trend of fragments probability
diﬀusion.

equation, we obtain the primary fragments with produc-
tion probability and excitation energy. The total kinetic
energy (TKE) of DNS is listed as a function of the mass
number of all formed fragments. Figture 3 shows the cal-
culation of TKE-mass distributions of the MNT primary
products for 48Ca, 124Sn, 204Hg, 232Th induced MNT
on targets 232Th, 238U and 248Cm with diﬀerent mass
asymmetry at incident energy Ec.m. = 1.1 × VB. This
calculated TKE - mass of 48Ca + 248Cm agrees roughly
well with available experimental data [41]. The TKE-
mass distribution is highly dependent on driving poten-
tial and mass asymmetry. Cross sections from TKE-mass

distributions prefer to populate in pockets of driving po-
tential. For the same target, the projectile is heavier
and the TKE-mass distribution is wider. For the same
projectile, targets with small mass variation have lim-
ited inﬂuence on the shape of TKE distribution. From
the TKE-mass distributions, it was found that the ten-
dency will be for mass to ﬂow toward the trans-target
fragments. The shapes of TKE-mass show strong rele-
vance with the impact parameter, which corresponds to
sticking time of DNS. For damped collisions, the sticking
time is quite short (about units of 10−21 s). These fast
events correspond to grazing collisions with intermediate
impact parameters, which are shown by the areas around
injection points. A large amount of kinetic energy is dissi-
pated very fast at relatively low mass transfer (more than
45 MeV during several units of 10−21 s). The other events
correspond to much slow collision with a large overlap of
nuclear surface and signiﬁcant nucleons rearrangement.
Predicted and experimental isotopic cross-sections of
Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es and Fm in 48Ca, 136Xe, 204Hg and
232Th induced reactions on 248Cm are shown in Fig. 4.
The experimental data have been obtained at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) and Gesellschaft f¨ur Schwe-
rionenforschung (GSI) in the 1980s, which correspond to
solid squares with error bars. the solid step lines are cal-
culation results that were listed with experimental data
used to make a comparison. Our calculations are nicely
consistent with the available experimental data of 48Ca
+ 248Cm at Elab = 263 MeV [3], of 86Kr + 248Cm at
Elab = 546 MeV [3], of 136Xe + 248Cm at Elab = 790
MeV [2], of 238U + 248Cm at Elab = 1760 MeV [1]. We
found that collisions with lighter heavy-ions showed pro-
duction cross-sections for the target-like actinides which
were at least as large as those obtained using the very
heavy projectiles 238U. Strong enhancement in the pro-
duction of Cf, Es, and Fm isotopes were produced when
238U were applied to bombard 248Cm as compared to
136Xe projectiles. Reactions of 238U + 248Cm were used
to explore the probability of synthesis superheavy nuclei.
Due to the limitation of detection technology, only these
events of Md, Fm, Es, Cf, and Bk isotopes have been
obtained, the cross-sections have four orders of magni-
tude higher than in the 238U + 238U reactions. Tar-
gets of 248Cm have been irradiated by beams of 136Xe
and 86Kr at energies around the Coulomb barrier in the
LBL’s SuperHILAC. Production cross-sections and exci-
tation functions of Md, Fm, Es, Cf, Bk, Cm, Am, Pu,
Np, U, Pa isotopes have been obtained, in which neutron-
rich actinides production and neutron shell eﬀect (N =
82 or Z = 50) have been discussed [3].

In reactions of 48Ca+248Cm near Coulomb barrier en-
ergies, the TLFs and PLFs are dominant in all isotopic
yields. In the 1980s, to explore the eﬀect of neutron-rich
48Ca on contributing to the yields of neutron-rich heavy
actinides and to determine what eﬀect the eight fewer
neutrons in 40Ca have on the mass distribution, two se-
ries of experiments were performed at LBL and GSI[2].

compared to experimental data[1–3] (solid square symbols wiht error bars)

Th, U, Pu have been observed in the reactions of 48Ca +
248Cm at incident energies Elab = 223-239, 248-263, 247-
263, 272-288, 304-318 MeV. In the year 2000, reactions
of 48Ca+248Cm at Elab = 265.4, 270.2 MeV have been
performed in GSI[42]. In the experiment, MNT reaction
products have been measured on SHIP. Due to the short
detection time, a few transtarget isotopes have been ob-
tained. They are 252,254 Cf, 254,256Es, 254,256Fm with
available cross-sections. However, in our calculations, we
could not reproduce the production cross-sections of very
neutron-deﬁcient isotopes.

We calculate production cross-sections of actinides iso-
topes with Z = 89 - 103 systematically in targets 232Th-,
238U- and 248Cm-based reactions with projectiles from Ar
to U. It was found that 204,206Hg as the projectile is favor-
able to produce unknown-yet neutron-rich actinide iso-
topes. To investigate the dependence of actinides produc-
tion on targets, production of actinides isotopes with Z =
89 - 103 in reactions of 204,206Hg bombard on 232Th, 238U
and 248Cm have been calculated systematically, corre-

spond to solid black, red, blue lines respectively. Produc-
tion of unknown neutron-rich actinide isotopes marked
by open circles were added in Fig. 5.

From Fig. 5, it was found that all three 232Th-, 238U-
and 248Cm-based reactions could produce available cross-
sections of new actinide isotopes. We mark 232Th-, 238U-

It should be noticed that neutron-
deﬁcient projectile 192Hg-induced reactions do not have
an obvious peak around injection points, because the
driving potential at its injection point is oﬀ the mini-
mum valley trajectory, however, which is contribute to
diﬀuse far beyond the target, even the superheavy nuclei
region.

Figure 8 shows comparison of calculations for primary
and secondary yields of 208Pb + 248Cm at Ec.m. = 1.1*VB
within and without quadrupole deformation. Open black
squares stand for existing isotopes in the nuclide chart,
which are added with calculation to highlight the un-
known isotopes. Solid black triangles represent the in-
jection points. Compare to the calculation involving
deformation, calculation without deformation tends to
the unknown neutron-rich region easily, which predicts
more new isotopes. Yield distribution without deforma-
tion is more smooth than that with dynamical deforma-
tion. From Fig. 8, it was found that primary yields cover
the whole actinide region as very large formation cross-
sections. The de-excitation process depressed the for-
mation of secondary cross-section at four orders of mag-
nitude level through ﬁssion, evaporating light particles,
and gamma-ray.

Yields distributions in target 248Cm-based reactions
with mass asymmetries and diﬀerent isospin projectiles
were shown in Fig. 9. From panels (a) and (c), it was
found that projectiles with lighter mass-induced reac-
tions diﬀuse more broadly, compared to heavy projectiles
induced reactions. In panels (b), (d), (f), and (h), yields
of more neutron-rich projectiles induced reactions tend to
shift to the unknown neutron-rich side, especially in the
actinide region. In panels (a), (c), (e), and (g), yields of
heavier mass projectiles-induced reactions tend to shift to
the unknown neutron-rich side, especially in the actinide
region easily. For 164Dy + 248Cm at Ec.m. = 1.1 × VB,
production cross-sections of neutron-rich fragments with
Z = 60 − 80 have been predicted magnitude level around
hundreds nanobarns.

Isotopes yields in panel (a), (b), (c) correspond to 48Ca, 124Sn
and 204Hg induced reaction with 232Th at incident energy
Ec.m. = 1.1*VB, respectively. Open-up triangles stand for
unknown actinide isotopes.

Dependence of survived actinide production cross-
section from Z = 89 - 103 in 48Ca, 124Sn and 204Hg in-
duced reaction with 232Th at Ec.m. = 1.1*VB were shown
in Fig. 7. All actinide isotopic distributions from Ac to
Lr are marked by solid black, red, green, blue, cyan, ma-
genta, dark yellow, navy, purple, wine, olive, dark cyan,
royal, orange, and violet lines in order.
It was found
that secondary actinide production is highly dependent
on projectile mass, especially for projectile mass in a
great shift. The more heavy projectile-induced MNT re-
action seems to produce more new neutron-rich actinide
isotopes, which consist of products in 206Hg induced re-
actions with 248Cm.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, based on DNS model, we perform calcula-
tions for targets 232Th-, 238U- and 248Cm-based reactions
with projectiles from over the nuclide chart at incident
energies Ec.m. = 1.1*VB, systematically. The formation
probabilities of MNT fragments diﬀuse along PES, re-
sulting in the occupation of the whole nuclide chart, es-
pecially covering the nuclei drip lines and unknown su-
perheavy region. However, highly exciting fragments are
rapidly ﬁssile. Survival probabilities for these fragments
in the unknown nuclide chart are quite low. Our calcu-
lations of 48Ca, 86Kr, 136Xe and 238U induced reactions
with 248Cm at incident energies around Coulomb bar-
riers have a good agreement with available experimen-
tal data reasonably. In this work, PES and TKE-mass
distributions for selected reactions were exported from
our calculations, which help us to predict the produc-
tion cross-section trends. The inﬂuence of mass asym-
metry and isospin eﬀect on actinide products in these

MNT reactions have been investigated thoroughly.

sections, showing a greater probability of synthesis of
unknown actinide around the drip line. Dependence of
actinide products on projectiles isospin eﬀect has been
studied by Ca, Xe, Sn, Xe, and Hg isotopes induced MNT
reactions with targets 232Th, 238U and 248Cm.
It was
found that the neutron-rich projectiles such as 204,206Hg
enhanced the production of the neutron-rich actinides. A
projectile-target combination of an actinide-based target
and a heavy neutron-rich projectile such as 204,206Hg +
248Cm were suggested to produce new neutron-rich ac-
tinide isotopes, and even could be used to produce new
superheavy nuclei. In this work, formation cross-sections
of massive unknown actinides with Z = 89-103 nearby
drip lines were predicted as the level magnitude from
nanobarn to millibarn.
