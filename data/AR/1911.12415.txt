In this research, ﬁve eclipsing binary stars were studied: AB Cas, AF Gem, AR Boo, BF Vir and CL Aur.
The large sets of moments of minima were used: from the international BRNO database and amateur observations
from the database AAVSO. Firstly, moments of minima for AAVSO observations were obtained (totally – 222
minima). The software MAVKA was used. It was kindly provided by Kateryna D. Andrych and Ivan L. Andronov
(2019OEJV..197...65A) and approximation with various methods in order to ﬁnd the best ﬁt. Then all obtai-
ned moments of minima were combined and O-C diagrams were plotted. For all stars these diagrams represented
sinusoidal-like oscillations with superposition of parabolic trend. One of the possible reasons for such oscillations
could be presence of well-known light-time eﬀect (LTE) caused by third component with elliptical orbit. Parabolic
trend was explained as mass transfer between components of binary system. For all these stars we computed possible
mass of the third component, orbital elements, mass transfer rate and errors for all computed values.
Key words: mass transfer, third component, orbital elements

Introduction

For this research ﬁve eclipsing binaries were chosen: AB Cas, AF Gem, AR Boo, BF Vir and CL Aur. All of
them are well-known stellar systems and were observed during long period of time [12]. To start the research,
period and initial epoch were taken from General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS [21]). Masses of the
binary systems were taken from previously published articles of diﬀerent authors.

For AR Boo, BF Vir and CL Aur errors of binary system masses were not provided by any author. Thus,

they were considered as 7% of each individual star mass.

O-C diagrams and bibliography analysis

Note: the ±1σ and ±2σ conﬁdence intervals are shown, where σ is an unbiased estimate or the r.m.s. deviation
of the points from the ﬁt.

AB Cas

Рис. 1: O-C curve of AB Cas

Mass transfer was supposed in [23], [16] and [24] and its rate was calculated there. Third component was
supposed and its mass computed in [23], [16], [2] and [24]. Orbital elements of the third components orbit
were computed in [2] and [24].

AF Gem

Third and forth components were supposed in [31] and their masses were estimated.

AR Boo

Mass transfer was supposed in [17]. Third component was supposed in [20] and [22]. Third components

mass was calculated only in [17]. Orbital elements were not estimated in any article.

Mass transfer rate was calculated in [19]. In addition, in this article mass and orbital elements of the third

component were obtained. In another article, [22] only third component mass was obtained.

CL Aur

Mass transfer rate was not calculated in any article before. In [30] and [31] both mass of the third

component was calculated. In [18] just third component’s mass was estimated.

Methods and algorithms

To compute the parameters of the third component and its orbit (as well as mass transfer rate) the classical
O-C analysis was used. From parameters of parabolic trend we computed rate of the mass transfer. From
oscillations orbital elements and third components mass were obtained. Both trend and oscillations were
simulated simultaneously.
Details about algorithm O-C analysis and formulas for calculation were described in our previous articles:
[25] and [26]. Moments of minima which were obtained using AAVSO observations were really helpful for
investigation. Total number of data points increased on 15%.

Analysis of MAVKA processing results

Software MAVKA was widely used in this research. Previous investigation and development of MAVKA
algorithms was done in [3], [6], [7], [11], [13]. In the ﬁnal version of this software there are 9 methods
of approximation. Firstly each minimum was processed with all nine ones. Then, for each minimum the
approximation with the best accuracy was chosen. Finally, the table with all moments of minima taken from
AAVSO database was created. Space limitation does not allow us to provide the whole table with all extrema.
However, the general description of the results is provided:

Рис. 6: Computed masses of the third components (squares) in comparison with previous results (dots)

Results in this article generally are not in good agreement with results of other authors. Generally di-
sagreement is several times larger than error bars. Such large deviation could be explained due to diﬀerent
orbital models and larger data set we used for current calculations. All of third components (according to
their masses) are low-mass stars with highly-eccentric orbits (average eccentricity is almost 0.7).
Mass transfer rates also are not in good agreement with previous researches. For AB Cas it is about 35-50 %
of the values, published in [23], [16] and [24]. For AR Boo the situation is opposite: computed mass transfer

rate is twice larger than in [17]. So large deviation could be due to diﬀerent ephemerides used in various
researches.
Orbital elements for AB Cas is quite diﬀerent from published in [2], [24]. Average deviation is about 25%.
For BF Vir obtained values are almost the same that ones in [19] and some of them even are within errors
of calculation. For CL Aur computed orbital elements mostly are within error bars ([29], [30]), except ω that
diﬀers almost for π/2 rad.
