In September 2017, solar active region (AR) 12673 evolved from a decaying sunspot to the most actively ﬂaring region
of Cycle 24. It produced 4 ﬂares above GOES X1 class and 8 ﬂares above M3 class. The total ﬂare index surpasses that
of the great AR 12192 despite having only ∼30% the sunspot size (Sun et al. 2015). Its X-9.3 (SOL2017-09-06T11:53)
ﬂare is the most intense one since 2005.

The ﬂaring activity is related to the emergence of signiﬁcant new magnetic ﬂux. Figure 1(a) shows a radial ﬁeld
map from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012). The emergence started southeast of an old
sunspot (remnant from AR 12665 and 12670). Multiple pairs of bipoles subsequently emerged on the eastern periphery
of the old sunspot with very diﬀerent orientations. Persistent ﬂux emergence, apparent coalescence, cancellation, and
shearing led to a complex βγδ sunspot group, featuring a quadrupolar conﬁguration and a reversed sigmoidal main
polarity inversion line. A detailed account of the morphological evolution is available in Yang et al. (2017).

Using HMI vector magnetograms (Hoeksema et al. 2014) from September 2nd to 7th, we calculated1 the unsigned
ﬂux (Φ) and the ﬂux emergence rate ( ˙Φ). We ﬁnd2 that Φ has a tenfold increase over the 5-day period to reach
6.08+0.02
× 1020 Mx hr−1. We additionally calculated ˙Φ in 6-hr chunks. The
−0.02
“instantaneous” ﬂux emergence rate peaked around September 3rd 21:00 with an extraordinary value of 1.12+0.15
−0.05 ×
1021 Mx hr−1. This occurred early during the evolution, when the ﬂux is only 36% of the maximum.

× 1022 Mx, and the average ˙Φ is 4.93+0.11
−0.13

The ﬂux emergence rate of AR 12673 is greater than any values reported in the literature of which we are aware.
Figure 1(b) summarizes the mean signed ﬂux emergence rate and peak signed ﬂux from a collection of observations
and simulations (Norton et al. 2017). AR 12763 largely follows the established trend, but the extreme values on its
evolutionary track are rivaled only by the fastest ﬂux emergence model and AR 12192, which has ∼3.6 times the ﬂux3.
Our preliminary analysis suggests that AR 12673 boasts some of the highest non-potential magnetic ﬁeld proxies of
all ARs in Cycle 24 (X. Sun, in preparation), many of which have been used to predict ﬂares and coronal mass ejections
(e.g., Bobra & Couvidat 2015). Because major eruptions tend to occur within a day or so following signiﬁcant ﬂux
emergence (Schrijver 2009), the emergence rate should be reconsidered as a parameter in ﬂare prediction, as initially
studied by Leka & Barnes (2003). AR 12673 will likely teach us more about the relations between fast ﬂux emergence,
strong non-potential ﬁeld, and ﬂaring activities.

1 We use pixels where the ﬁeld strength is above 200 G. The uncertainty of Φ shows the standard deviation within a 96-min averaging
window. The formal uncertainty from spectral inversion is small. We calculate ˙Φ using linear regression on bootstrapped samples of Φ,
and show the median and 2σ conﬁdence interval.

2 Data quality deteriorates after September 7th when the AR is more than 45◦ away from the disk center. We take Φ at 2017-09-07T00:00
as the maximum ﬂux, Φm ≈ 6.08 × 1022 Mx, and the mean before 2017-09-02T12:00 as the background ﬂux Φ0 ≈ 6.20 × 1021 Mx. Following
Leka et al. (2013), we deﬁne 2017-09-03T11:00 as the start of emergence when Φ − Φ0 = 0.1(Φm − Φ0).

3 We perform the same calculation for AR 12192 between 2014 October 22nd and 27th. The dataset is aﬀected by systematic artifacts
that correlate with daily spacecraft velocity variations (Sun et al. 2015), so the instantaneous ˙Φ is less certain. The maximum Φ, mean ˙Φ,
and maximum instantaneous ˙Φ are 2.18+0.00

× 1020 Mx hr−1, and 1.42+0.14

Figure 1. Rapid ﬂux emergence in AR 12673. (a) HMI radial ﬁeld map. Following Yang et al. (2017), we mark the old sunspot
by a plus sign, and four major bipoles, i.e. positive (negative) component of bipole A by PA (NA), etc. PA and PB have
coalesced into an arc, hugging the sunspot from the east. The collision site between the newly emerging PC and ND is the future
epicenter of ﬂaring activity. (b) Diagram of mean signed ˙Φ vs maximum signed Φ for various observations and simulations,
adapted from Figure 5 of Norton et al. (2017). Red and blue symbols indicate simulations and observations, respectively. We
overplot AR 12673 and its evolutionary track in orange, and AR 12192 in green. We simply divide the unsigned Φ and ˙Φ by 2
to get the signed version.
