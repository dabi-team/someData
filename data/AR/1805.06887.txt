We measure a large set of observables in inclusive charged current muon neutrino scattering on argon with
the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber operating at Fermilab. We evaluate three neutrino in-
teraction models based on the widely used GENIE event generator using these observables. The measurement
uses a data set consisting of neutrino interactions with a ﬁnal state muon candidate fully contained within the

 
 
 
 
 
 
MicroBooNE detector. These data were collected in 2016 with the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, which has
an average neutrino energy of 800 MeV, using an exposure corresponding to 5.0 × 1019 protons-on-target. The
analysis employs fully automatic event selection and charged particle track reconstruction and uses a data-driven
technique to separate neutrino interactions from cosmic ray background events. We ﬁnd that GENIE models
consistently describe the shapes of a large number of kinematic distributions for ﬁxed observed multiplicity.

INTRODUCTION

A growing number of neutrino physics experiments use liq-
uid argon as a neutrino interaction target nucleus in a time
projection chamber [1]. Experiments that use or will use liq-
uid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) technology in-
clude those in the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program [2]
at Fermilab, centered on searches for non-standard neutrino
oscillations, and the long-baseline DUNE experiment [3]. The
SBN program consists of the MicroBooNE experiment [4], an
upgraded ICARUS experiment [5], and the new SBND exper-
iment [6]. The DUNE experiment seeks to establish the mass
ordering of the three standard model neutrinos and the charge
parity violation parameter phase δCP in the PMNS neutrino
mixing matrix [7].

All LArTPC neutrino oscillation-related measurements re-
quire a precise understanding of neutrino scattering physics
and the measured response of the LArTPC detector to ﬁnal
state particles. These depend on: (a) the neutrino ﬂux seen by
the experiment, (b) the neutrino scattering cross sections, (c)
the interaction physics of scattering ﬁnal state particles with
argon, (d) transport and instrumentation effects of charge and
light in the LArTPCs, and (e) software reconstruction algo-
rithms. In practice item (a) is determined by a combination of
hadron production cross section measurements and precise de-
scriptions of neutrino beamline components. Item (b) is most
commonly provided by the GENIE [8] neutrino event gener-
ation model for neutrino-argon scattering.
Items (c)-(e) are
incorporated into a detailed suite of GEANT4-based [9] simu-
lation and event reconstruction products called LArSoft [10].
GENIE has been built up from models of the most im-
portant physical scattering neutrino-nucleon mechanisms for
the SBN and DUNE energy regimes (0.5 − 5 GeV) : quasi-
elastic (QE) scattering ν(cid:96)N → (cid:96)−N(cid:48), ν(cid:96)N(cid:48), resonance produc-
tion (RES) ν(cid:96)N → (cid:96)−R, ν(cid:96)R(cid:48), and non-resonant multi-hadron
production referred to as deep inelastic scattering (DIS):
ν(cid:96)N → (cid:96)−X, ν(cid:96)X (cid:48) [11]. The underlying neutrino-nucleon scat-
tering processes receive signiﬁcant modiﬁcation from the nu-
clear environment, including the effects of Fermi motion of
target nucleons, many-nucleon effects, and ﬁnal state interac-
tions (FSI) [12]. While GENIE has received a fair amount
of “tuning” (the process of ﬁnding a set of GENIE parame-
ters chosen to optimize agreement with a particular data set)
from previous electron and neutrino scattering measurements,
considerable uncertainties remain in the modeling of both the
underlying neutrino-nucleon scattering and the nuclear envi-
ronment [13].

Relatively few neutrino scattering measurements on argon
exist [14–19], especially for the recoil hadronic system. Most
of these report low-statistics exclusive ﬁnal states. Nearly
all existing neutrino scattering constraints on GENIE models
derive measurements on scattering from carbon, which
has 30% of argon’s atomic mass number and a 22% lower

the MicroBooNE experiment

neutron-to-proton ratio. We take a step in improving the
empirical understanding of neutrino scattering from argon
here by performing a large set of comparisons of observed
inclusive properties of charged current scattering, measured
in the Fermilab Booster
at
Neutrino Beam (BNB) [20] (MicroBooNE and MiniBooNE
share the same beam), to predictions from several variants
of GENIE. These comparisons are generated by applying
fully automated event reconstruction and signal selection
tools to a subset of MicroBooNE’s ﬁrst collected data. While
this analysis must focus in large part on reducing cosmic ray
backgrounds, sensitivity to GENIE model parameters remains.

In Sec. II, we introduce the formalism that relates inter-
action models to our measurements.
In Sec. III, we de-
scribe the MicroBooNE detector and Booster Neutrino Beam.
Section IV describes the cosmic ray backgrounds in Micro-
BooNE. Section V summarizes the event selection procedure
and the main software tools used in the analysis. Section VI
presents the procedure for discriminating BNB neutrino in-
teractions from cosmic ray background events. Section VII
shows the results of a systematic uncertainty analysis. Sec-
tion VIII presents the comparison of observed charged particle
multiplicity distributions and charged track kinematic distribu-
tions for each multiplicity, to predictions from GENIE. Sec-
tion IX provides a discussion of the result, and Sec. X gives an
overall conclusion.

INTRODUCTION TO OBSERVED CHARGED

PARTICLE MULTIPLICITY AND KINEMATIC
DISTRIBUTIONS

Neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE detector produce
charged particles that can be reconstructed as tracks in the liq-
uid argon medium of the MicroBooNE LArTPC. These inter-
actions can be characterized by a number of inclusive prop-
erties. The charged particle multiplicity, or number of pri-
mary charged particles, n, is a simple observable character-
izing ﬁnal states in high-energy-collision processes, including
neutrino interactions. We note that in MicroBooNE the ob-
servable charged particle multiplicity corresponds to that of
charged particles exiting the target nucleus participating in the
neutrino interaction.

The charged particle multiplicity distributions (CPMD)
comprise the set of probabilities, Pn, associated with produc-
ing n charged particles in an event, either in full phase space or
in restricted phase space domains. In addition to the observed
CPMD, kinematic properties of all charged particle tracks for
each multiplicity can be examined. Determination of inclu-
sive event properties such as the CPMD and of individual track
kinematic properties at Fermilab BNB neutrino energies natu-
rally ﬁts into the modern strategy [11] of presenting neutrino
interaction measurements in the form of directly observable

quantities.

Inclusive measurements expand the empirical knowledge of
neutrino-argon scattering that will be required by the DUNE
experiment and the Fermilab SBN program. As physical ob-
servables, the CPMD and other distributions can also be used
to test models, or particular tunes of models such as GENIE.
These models are typically constructed from a set of exclusive
cross section channels, and tests of inclusive distributions can
provide independent checks.

We describe here an evaluation of several variants of GE-
NIE against observed charged particle distributions, including
the observed CPMD in MicroBooNE data collected in 2016
in the Fermilab BNB. For the observed CPMD, we mean the
conditional probability, after application of certain detector se-
lection requirements, of observing a neutrino interaction with
n charged tracks relative to the probability of observing a neu-
trino interaction with at least one charged track:

On =

Nobs,n
∞
∑
m=1

Nobs,m

,

(1)

where Nobs,n is the number of neutrino interaction events with
n observed tracks.

Our analysis requires at least one of the charged tracks to
be consistent with a muon; hence the On are effectively ob-
served CPMD for νµ charged current (νµ CC) interactions.
The νµ NC, νe, ¯νe, and ¯νµ backgrounds, in total, are expected
to be less than 10% of the ﬁnal sample. The muon candidate
is included in the charged particle multiplicity, and all events
thus have n ≥ 1. For each multiplicity, we have available the
kinematic properties of charged tracks. These can in principle
be related to the 4-vector components of each track; however,
we choose distributions of directly observable quantities in the
detector: visible track length and track angles.

Values for On depend on cross sections for producing a mul-
tiplicity n, σCC,n, as well as the BNB neutrino ﬂux and detector
acceptance and efﬁciency:

where Eν is the neutrino energy, Φν (Eν ) is the neutrino ﬂux
summed over νµ , ¯νµ , νe, and ¯νe species, dΠn(cid:48) represents the
n(cid:48)-particle ﬁnal state phase space, εn,n(cid:48) (Eν , Πn(cid:48)) is an accep-
tance and efﬁciency matrix that gives the probability that an
n(cid:48) charged particle ﬁnal state produced in phase space element
dΠn(cid:48) is observed as an n-particle ﬁnal state in the detector,
and dσCC,n(cid:48) (Eν , Πn(cid:48)) /dΠn(cid:48) are the differential cross sections
for producing a multiplicity n(cid:48). One can likewise express the
distribution of any observed kinematic distribution Xn corre-
sponding to an observed multiplicity n as

where ˆεn,n(cid:48) (Eν , Πn(cid:48) → Xn) is the probability that an n(cid:48) charged
particle ﬁnal state produced in phase space element dΠn(cid:48) pro-
duces the observed value Xn of the kinematic variable in the
detector. In practice we obtain the On and distributions of Xn
directly from data and compare these to values derived from
evaluating Eqs. 2 and 3 using a Monte Carlo simulation that
includes GENIE neutrino interaction event generators coupled
to detailed GEANT-based models of the Fermilab BNB and
the detector.

The observed CPMD and inclusive observed kinematic dis-
tributions have several desirable attributes. The σCC,n are all
large up to n (cid:46) 4 at these neutrino energies (see Sec. III); there-
fore only modest event statistics are required. Only minimal
kinematic properties of the ﬁnal state are imposed (the track
deﬁnition implies an effective minimum kinetic energy), and
complexities associated with particle identiﬁcation and photon
reconstruction are avoided. At the same time, the observed
quantities reveal much of the power of the LArTPC in iden-
tifying and characterizing complex neutrino interactions. The
observed CPMD and associated kinematic distribution ratios
will have reduced sensitivity to systematic normalization un-
certainties associated with ﬂux and efﬁciency compared to ab-
solute cross section measurements.

A disadvantage of the use of observed CPMD and other
kinematic quantities is their lack of portability. One must have
access to the full MicroBooNE simulation suite to use the On
to test other models.

III. THE MICROBOONE DETECTOR AND THE
BOOSTER NEUTRINO BEAM

FIG. 1: Event display showing raw data for a region of the
collection plane associated with a candidate high-multiplicity
neutrino event. Wire-number is represented on the horizontal
axis, and time on the vertical. Color is associated with the
charge deposition on each wire. Two perpendicularly
crossing tracks are cosmic tracks which is the dominant
background. The gaps in tracks are due to non-responsive
wires in the detector [21].

The MicroBooNE detector is a LArTPC installed on the

4

date is required to have at least 80 collection plane hits. Fur-
thermore, as described in Sec. V B, we use two discriminants
to extract the neutrino interaction and cosmic ray background
contributions to our data sample that are based on collection
plane hits.

A light collection system consisting of 32 8-inch photomul-
tiplier tubes (PMTs) with nanosecond timing resolution en-
ables precise determination of the time of the neutrino interac-
tion, which crucially aids in the reduction of cosmic ray back-
grounds.

The BNB employs protons from the Fermilab Booster syn-
chrotron impinging on a beryllium target. The proton beam
comes in bunches of protons called “beam spills”, has a kinetic
energy of 8 GeV, a repetition rate of up to 5 Hz, and is capable
of producing 5 × 1012 protons-per-spill. Secondary pions and
kaons decay producing neutrinos with an average energy of
800 MeV. MicroBooNE received 3.6 × 1020 protons-on-target
in its ﬁrst year of running, from fall 2015 through summer
2016. This analysis uses a fraction of that data corresponding
to 5.0 × 1019 protons-on-target.

IV. COSMIC RAY BACKGROUNDS

The MicroBooNE detector lacks appreciable shielding from
cosmic rays (CR) since the detector is at the earth’s surface
and has little overburden. Most events that are recorded and
processed through an online software trigger which requires
that the total light recorded with the PMT system exceeds
6.5 photoelectrons (PE) during neutrino beam operations
(“on-beam data”) contain no neutrino interactions. Triggered
events with a neutrino interaction typically have the products
of up to 20 cosmic rays coincident with the beam spill in the
event readout window (4.8 msec) contributing to a recorded
event along with the products of the neutrino collision. A
large sample of events recorded under identical conditions as
the on-beam data, minus the coincidence requirement with
the beam, (“off-beam-data”) has been recorded for use in
characterizing cosmic ray backgrounds. A straightforward
on-beam minus off-beam background subtraction is difﬁcult,
as the off-beam data does not reproduce all correlated detector
effects associated with on-beam events that contain a neutrino
interaction with several overlaid cosmic rays. The situation
is particularly complicated with events containing neutrino
interactions with Nobs,n = 1, which share the same topology
with the most common single-muon CR conﬁguration.
Monte Carlo simulations of the CR ﬂux using the CORSIKA
package [22] provide useful guidance; however, the ability of
these simulations to describe the very rare CR topologies that
closely match neutrino interactions is not well known.

For these reasons this analysis employs a method to sep-
arate neutrino interaction candidates from CR backgrounds
that is driven by the data itself. Even though CR tracks should
always appear to at least enter the detector, they can satisfy the
experimental condition of being fully contained if a segment
of the CR track falls outside the data acquisition readout time
window, or if a segment of the track fails to be identiﬁed
due to instrumentation- or algorithm-related inefﬁciencies.
The separation of neutrino interaction candidates from CR

Fermilab BNB. It is a high-resolution surface detector de-
signed to accurately identify neutrino interactions [4]. It be-

BooNE data.

the beam direction, 2.3 meters tall, and 2.6 meters in the elec-
tron drift direction. Electrons require 2.3 ms to drift across
the full width of the TPC from cathode (at −70 kV) to anode
(at ∼ 0 kV). Events are read out on three anode wire planes
with 3 mm spacing between wires. Drifting electrons pass
through the ﬁrst two wire planes, which are oriented at ±60
degrees relative to vertical, producing bipolar induction sig-
nals. The third wire plane, the collection plane, has its wires
oriented vertically and collects the charge of the drifting elec-
trons in the form of a unipolar signal. The MicroBooNE read-
out electronics allow for measurement of both the time and
charge created by drifting electrons on each wire. The ampli-
ﬁed, shaped waveforms from 8256 wires from induction and
collection planes are digitized at 2 MHz using 12-bit ADCs.
A data acquisition system readout window consisting of 9600
recorded samples (4.8 msec) for all wires is then noise-ﬁltered
and deconvolved utilizing ofﬂine software algorithms. Recon-
struction algorithms are then used on these output waveforms
to reconstruct the times and amplitudes of charge depositions
(hits) on the wires from particle-induced ionization in the TPC
bulk.

While all three anode planes are used for track reconstruc-
tion, the collection plane provides the best signal-to-noise per-
formance and charge resolution. The analysis presented here
excludes regions of the detector that have non-functional col-
lection plane channels (∼ 10%). It also imposes requirements
on the minimum number of collection plane hits−current
pulses processed through noise ﬁltering [21], deconvolution,
and calibration−associated with the reconstructed tracks. All
charged particle track candidates are required to have at least
15 collection plane hits, and the longest muon track candi-

φ= π/2φ= 0φ= πφ= -π/2YX(Track pointing into the page)backgrounds rests on the observation that a neutrino νµ
CC interaction produces a ﬁnal state µ − that slows down
as it moves away from its production point at the neutrino
interaction vertex due to ionization energy loss in the liquid
argon. As it slows down, its rate of restricted energy loss [23],
dE/dxR, increases, and deviations from a linear trajectory
due to multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) become more
pronounced. A CR muon track can produce an apparent
neutrino interaction vertex if it comes to rest in the detector
or it is not fully reconstructed to the edge of the TPC, but the
CR track will exhibit large dE/dxR and MCS effects in the
vicinity of this vertex. Furthermore, the vast majority of νµ
CC muons travel in the neutrino beam direction (“upstream”
to “downstream”), whereas CR muons move upstream or
downstream with equal probability.

V. EVENT SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION

A. Data

This analysis uses two data samples:

• “On-beam data”,

taken only during periods when a
beam spill from the BNB is actually sent. The on-beam
data used in this analysis were recorded from February
to April 2016 using data taken in runs in which the BNB
and all detector systems functioned well. This sam-
ple comprises about 15% of the total neutrino data col-
lected by MicroBooNE in its ﬁrst running period (Octo-
ber 2015 to summer 2016),

• “Off-beam data” taken with the same software trigger
settings as the on-beam data, but during periods when no
beam was received. The off-beam data were collected
from February to October 2016.

B. Simulation

The LArSoft software framework is used for processing
data events and Monte Carlo simulation (MC) events in the
same way. Three simulation samples are used in this analysis:

• Neutrino interactions simulated with a default GENIE
model overlaid with CORSIKA CR events (“MC de-
fault”),

• MC default augmented by the GENIE implementation
of the Meson Exchange Current model [24] overlaid
with CORSIKA CR events (“MC with MEC”),

• MC default augmented by the GENIE implementation
of the Transverse Enhancement Model [25] overlaid
with CORSIKA CR events (“MC with TEM”).

The GENIE models used in this analysis are Relativistic
Fermi Gas model [26] for the nuclear momentum, Llewellyn-
Smith [27] for QE interactions, Rein-Sehgal model [28] for
resonance interactions, and Empirical model by Dytman [29]

5

for MEC interactions. The MC default does not include
contributions from the excitation of two particle-two hole
(2p2h) [30] ﬁnal states in neutrino-nucleus scattering, which
may be important for low energy neutrinos. The MC with
MEC and TEM include the excitation of 2p2h ﬁnal states in
neutrino-nucleus scattering in alternative ways. In TEM, the
empirical superscaling function is modeled with an effective
spectral function (ESF) [31].

The generator stage (production of a set of ﬁnal state four-
vectors for particles originating from the argon nucleus as
a result of the νµ -Ar interaction in GENIE) employs GE-
NIE (version v2.8.6d for the MC default and v2.10.6 for the
MC with MEC and TEM) with overlaid simulated CR back-
grounds using CORSIKA version v7.4003 with a constant
mass composition model (CMC) [32] at 226 m above sea-
level elevation. Simulated secondary particle propagation uti-
lizes GEANT version v4.9.6.p04d using a physics particle list
QGSP BIC with custom physics list for optical photons, and
the detector simulation employs LArSoft version v4.36.00.
All GENIE samples were processed with the same GEANT
and LArSoft versions for detector simulation and reconstruc-
tion. These samples thus allow for relative comparison of dif-
ferent GENIE models to the data.

C. Reconstruction

Event reconstruction makes use of anode plane waveforms
from the TPC and light signals from the PMT system. Raw
signals from the TPC, recorded on the wires, ﬁrst pass through
a noise ﬁlter [21] before hits are extracted from the observed
waveforms on each wire. A set of reconstruction algorithms
known as Pandora [33, 34] combine hits connected in space
and time into two-dimensional (2D) clusters for each of the
three anode planes. Then a three-dimensional (3D) vertex
reconstruction is performed in which the energy deposition
around the vertex and the knowledge of the beam direction
is used to preferentially select vertex candidates with more de-
posited energy and with low z coordinates, respectively. 2D
clusters in all three planes are then merged into 3D tracks and
showers. The preferential direction for tracks and showers is
also from the upstream to the downstream end of the detector.
In this analysis, for each 3D track candidate, the start position
is taken to be the 3D track end closest to the candidate neu-
trino vertex, if the track satisﬁes the requirement that the track
start position is sufﬁciently close to the vertex. This analysis
makes no use of shower objects, which are mainly associated
with electrons and photons.

Light collected on the 32 PMTs in MicroBooNE is used
to reconstruct optical hits. To reduce sensitivity to possi-
ble ﬂuctuations in the signal baseline, a threshold-based hit-
reconstruction algorithm requires PMT pulses of a minimum
charge for a hit to be reconstructed. A weighted sum of PMT
hits (optical ﬂashes) are reconstructed by requiring a time co-
incidence of ∼1 µs between hits on multiple PMTs. The rel-
ative timing and charge collection of optical hits, along with
the spatial locations of the PMT, within an optical ﬂash is
then used to associate the ﬂash with reconstructed tracks in
the TPC, a process known as ﬂash-matching.

D. Event Selection

Event selection starts by requiring an optical ﬂash within
the 1.6 µs duration beam spill window and the summed light
collected by the PMT to exceed 50 PE. Reconstructed vertices
must be contained in the ﬁducial volume of the detector, de-
ﬁned as 10 cm from the border of the active volume in x, 10 cm
from the border of the active volume in z, and 20 cm from the
border of the active volume in y (see Fig. 2 for detector coordi-
nates). At each candidate neutrino interaction vertex, a candi-
date muon track is identiﬁed as the longest of all tracks starting
within 5 cm of the vertex. The candidate muon track is further
required to be fully contained within the detector, where con-
tainment requires both ends of the track to lie within the same
ﬁducial volume required for an event vertex, to have at least
75 cm 3D track length, and to have an event vertex located
within 80 cm in z of the PMT-reconstructed position of an op-
tical ﬂash. Considerable CR backgrounds remain after these
pre-selection procedures, with signal/background ≈ 1/1.

Pre-selected events then pass through a second stage ﬁlter
that imposes further quality conditions on track candidates.
Start and end points of the candidate muon must lie in detector
regions with functional collection plane wires. The candidate
muon track must start 46 cm below the top surface of the
TPC in order to suppress CR backgrounds, must start within
3 cm (reduced from 5 cm) of the selected vertex position,
must have at least 80 hits in the collection wire plane, and
must not have signiﬁcant wire gaps in the start and end 20
collection plane-hit segments used in the pulse-height (PH)
test (Sec. V E 1) and the multiple Coulomb scattering test
(Sec. V E 2).

Events satisfying all of the above criteria constitute the
ﬁnal data sample. Table I lists the event passing rates for the
on-beam data, off-beam data, and the MC default samples
at different steps of the event selection. The passing rates in
on-beam data are consistent with expectations for a mix of
CR-only events, as provided by the off-beam data, and events
containing a neutrino interaction in addition to cosmic rays,
as provided by the MC.

The observed multiplicity of a selected event is deﬁned to
be the number of particles starting within 3 cm of the selected
vertex that have at
least 15 collection plane hits where
the Pandora MicroBooNE track reconstruction algorithms
perform optimally. There is no containment requirement for
tracks other than the candidate muon track. Table II lists
the number of selected events in each multiplicity bin with
relative event rates for on-beam data, off-beam data, and MC
default samples.

The minimum collection plane hit condition corresponds to
a minimum range in liquid argon of 4.5 cm, and the require-
ment thus excludes charged particles below a particle-type-
dependent kinetic energy threshold from entering our sample
that ranges from 31 MeV for a π ± to 69 MeV for a proton.
No acceptance exists for particles with kinetic energies below
these thresholds, which roughly increase as the secant of the
track angle with respect to the neutrino beam direction.

The average efﬁciency for the Pandora-based track recon-

6

struction used in this analysis is (cid:104)ε(cid:105) ≈ 45% at the 15 collec-
tion plane hit threshold. This relatively low value, with im-
plicit kinetic energy thresholds, creates a common occurrence
called “feed-down” wherein events produced with n tracks at
the argon nucleus exit position are reconstructed with an ob-
served multiplicity n(cid:48) < n. For example, n = 1 is commonly
observed because one of the two tracks in a quasi-elastic-like
event fails to be reconstructed due to low acceptance or track-
ing efﬁciency.

The candidate muon containment requirement limits its en-
ergy to be (cid:46) 1.2 GeV depending on the muon scattering angle.
This results in a sample biased towards relatively higher in-
elasticity, EH /Eν , with EH being the energy transferred from
the neutrino to the hadronic system in the collision.

Figure 3 shows the GENIE expectations for the true kinetic
energy of muons, protons, and pions produced in BNB neu-
trino interactions in MicroBooNE. The kinetic energy thresh-
olds associated with the 15 collection plane hit requirement for
short tracks and the 75 cm 3D track length requirement for the
long track are evident.

E. Event Classiﬁcation

Selected events are next classiﬁed into four categories based
on whether they pass or fail the PH test and the MCS test
described in the following sections. These are the candidate
muon track direction-based tests which are used to separate
neutrino signal and CR background contributions in the sam-
ple. Table III lists the event selection rates for the on-beam
data, off-beam data, and the MC default samples in each cat-
egory. The ﬁnal samples are called neutrino-enriched, mixed,
or background-enriched sub-samples depending on whether
events pass both tests, pass either one of the two tests, or fail
both tests, respectively.

1. Pulse Height Test

A neutrino-induced muon from a CC event will exhibit an
increasing rate of energy loss as one moves downstream along
its track. A visual diagram for the PH test is shown in Fig. 4.
We take into account the expected behavior of the rate of re-
stricted energy loss, dE/dxR, with the following procedure:

• Compute the truncated mean of the pulse heights de-
posited in 20 consecutive collection plane hits, (cid:104)PH(cid:105)U ,
starting 10 hits away from the upstream end of the muon
track that is taken as a proxy for the upstream restricted
energy loss. The truncated mean is formed by taking
the average of the 20 PH after removing individual PH
that do not lie within the range of 20% − 200% of the
average [35]:

• Form three 20 collection plane-hit long track segments
at the upstream, downstream, and geometric center of
the track. The upstream and downstream segments are
displaced by 10 collection plane hits from the upstream
and downstream ends of the track, respectively,

• Perform a simple linear least squares ﬁt of hit time vs.

hits at the upstream end of the track. Denote the de-

collection plane hits at the downstream end of the track.
Denote the determined line as LD. Finally perform one
more similar ﬁt from the 20 collection plane hits located
about the geometric center of the track. Denote this line
as LM,

• Compare the hit time predicted at the geometric center
of the track, tC, by LM, which uses hits about the ge-
ometric center, to the time predicted at the geometric
center of the track by the projection of LU from the be-
ginning of the track:

• Form the test q = ∆tUM < ∆tDM. Since MCS should
become, on average, more pronounced along the down-

didate. Muons from νµ CC interactions will pass this
test with a probability P (MCS). Muons from CR back-
ground can be characterized by the probability that they
fail this test, denoted as Q (MCS) .

2. Multiple Coulomb Scattering Test

A neutrino-induced muon from a CC event will generally
exhibit an increasing degree of multiple Coulomb scattering
(MCS) about a nominal straight line trajectory as one moves
from upstream to downstream along the track. A visual dia-
gram for the MCS test is shown in Fig. 6. We take into ac-
count the expected MCS behavior by an independent test with
the following procedure:

two tests by the symbol CR, thus creating the categories “νν”,
“νCR”, “CRν”, “CRCR”, which contain a corresponding num-
ber of events Nνν , NνCR, NCRν , and NCRCR. The “νν” and
“CRCR” categories are expected to have relatively high neu-
trino or CR purity, respectively; while the “νCR” and “CRν”
have mixed purity.

On-beam data consists of a mixture of neutrino interaction
and CR background events. We designate a passing of the

We next build a model for the number of events in each

category as follows:

ˆNνν = P (MCS|PH) P (PH) ˆNν

+ (1 − Q (PH) − Q (MCS) + Q (MCS|PH) Q (PH)) ˆNCR,

ˆNCRν = (1 − P (MCS|PH)) P (PH) ˆNν

+ (Q (MCS) − Q (MCS|PH) Q (PH)) ˆNCR,

ˆNνCR = (P (MCS) − P (MCS|PH) P (PH)) ˆNν
+ (1 − Q (MCS|PH)) Q (PH) ˆNCR,

ˆNCRCR = Q (MCS|PH) Q (PH) ˆNCR

+ (1 − P (PH) − P (MCS) + P (MCS|PH) P (PH)) ˆNν .

(10)

(11)

The quantities ˆNνν , ˆNCRν , ˆNνCR, and ˆNCRCR are model param-
eters corresponding to the observed number of events Nνν ,
NνCR, NCRν , and NCRCR, respectively. ˆNν and ˆNCR are the es-
timated number of neutrino and CR events, in the sample, to
be determined by a ﬁt described below. The quantities P (PH)
and P (MCS) represent the average probabilities that a neutrino
interaction muon passes the PH or MCS test condition, while
Q (PH) and Q (MCS) denote the mean probabilities that a cos-
mic ray muon fails one of these tests. The conditional proba-
bility P (MCS|PH) denotes the fraction of time that a neutrino
interaction muon event that passes the MCS condition after it
has passed the PH condition, and the conditional probability
Q (MCS|PH) denotes the fraction of time that a cosmic ray
event muon fails the MCS test after failing the PH test.

As the MCS and PH conditions result from different physi-
cal processes (muon-nucleus and muon-electron scattering, re-
spectively), and the MCS and PH test are formed from dif-
ferent measurements (time and charge, respectively), the PH
and MCS tests are nearly independent with P (MCS|PH) ≈
P (MCS) and Q (MCS|PH) ≈ Q (MCS).
In the analysis we
ﬁnd evidence for weak, but non-negligible, correlations be-
tween the tests, and use the conditional probabilities to take
these into account.

We collect data and construct a similar model for off-beam
data, which contains no neutrino content, dividing the events
into the same categories as above, and ﬁtting the observed
number of events in each category, N(cid:48)
CRν , and
N(cid:48)
CRCR to the parameterizations:

In this case the νν and CRCR categories are expected to be

CR is the estimated

CR content of the sample (in practice the number of events in

Our algorithm uses the eight categories of events in on-
beam and off-beam data to estimate the neutrino content in

each multiplicity bin. To calculate the MC distributions, we
replace the on-beam data with the MC samples and perform
the ﬁt again. The same off-beam data sample was used in

lation between the PH and MCS tests. These correlations are

each multiplicity. When the probability parameters P (PH),
P (MCS), Q (PH), and Q (MCS) are consistent between multi-
plicities, we use all multiplicities together in their determina-
tion for improved statistical precision and vary only the three
parameters ˆNν , ˆNCR, and ˆN(cid:48)
CR for each individual multiplicity.

C. Results with Simulated Events

Maximum likelihood ﬁts were performed on all three GE-
NIE simulation samples to extract the values of seven param-
eters ˆNν , ˆNCR, ˆN(cid:48)
CR, P(PH), Q(PH), P(MCS), and Q(MCS)).
Parameters αν and αCR and their uncertainties were extracted
from MC and off-beam data samples and kept ﬁxed for the
subsequent ﬁts. As expected, the PH and MCS probabilities
show no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the three
GENIE models considered. Table IV lists the values obtained
from the ﬁt for the above-mentioned parameters in the default
MC and the MicroBooNE data.

The number of neutrino events in the simulated data sam-
ples were extracted for each observed multiplicity and com-
pared to the known number from the event generation. Ta-
ble V and Fig. 8 summarize this comparison. We ﬁnd that the
ﬁt results agree within statistics with the known inputs, indi-
cating a lack of bias in our signal estimation technique. We

have also veriﬁed that our method is insensitive to the signal-
to-background ratio of the sample over a range corresponding
to 0.2 − 5.0 times that estimated in the data.

VII. STATISTICAL AND SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY
ESTIMATES

Table VI presents the percentage estimates for statistical
and systematic uncertainties from different sources. Figure 9
presents a plot of each uncertainty source as a function of ob-
served multiplicity.

A. Statistical Uncertainties

Statistical uncertainties are returned from the MINUIT
package used in our ﬁtting for both data and MC samples.
These uncertainties include contributions from the CR back-
ground in our ﬁtting procedure, and our procedure includes
the CR background systematic uncertainty in a contribution to
the total statistical uncertainty. Both data and MC statistics

B. Short Track Efﬁciency Uncertainties

The dominant systematic uncertainty originates from the
differences in the efﬁciency between data and simulation for
reconstructing short-length hadron tracks. The overall efﬁ-
ciencies of the Pandora reconstruction algorithms are a strong
function of the number of hits of the tracks, with a plateau
not being reached until of order of several hundred hits. The
inclusive efﬁciencies for reconstructing protons or pions at
the 15 collection plane hit threshold is estimated to be (cid:104)ε(cid:105) =
0.45 ± 0.05. The absolute efﬁciency value is not used in this
analysis, but we use this estimate to conservatively assign a
mean efﬁciency uncertainty of δ = 15%.

We then estimate the effect of an efﬁciency uncertainty on
multiplicity by the following procedure: Consider a track in an
event in a multiplicity bin N.
If one lowers the tracking efﬁ-
ciency by the factor 1 − δ , then there is a 1 − δ probability that
the track remained reconstructed and the event stayed in that
multiplicity bin, and a probability δ that the track would not
have been reconstructed and that the event would thus have a

short tracks and one long track, and each track’s reconstruction
probability is reduced by a factor 1 − δ , then an overall frac-
tion of events (1 − δ )N−1 will remain in the bin, and a fraction
1 − (1 − δ )N−1 will migrate to lower multiplicity bins. The
fraction of tracks that migrate to multiplicity N(cid:48) < N from bin
N, f (N(cid:48); N, δ ), is given by binomial statistics:

f (cid:0)N(cid:48); N, δ (cid:1) =

(N − 1)!
(N(cid:48) − 1)! (N − N(cid:48))!

We use this result to generate the expected observed CPMD
in simulation that would emerge from lowering the tracking
efﬁciency by the factor 1 − δ compared to the default simu-
lated CPMD. The difference between the two distributions
is then taken as the systematic uncertainty assigned to short
track efﬁciency, with the assumption that the effect of increas-
ing the default efﬁciency by a factor 1 + δ would produce a
symmetric change. Table VII summarizes this study for the
three GENIE models used. The observed multiplicity = 1
probability increases because of “feed down” of events from
higher multiplicity, due to the lowered efﬁciency, mainly from
observed multiplicity = 2. The other observed multiplicity
probabilities decrease accordingly. The largest effects are in
high multiplicity bins because the loss of events from lower-
ing the efﬁciency by the factor (1 − δ ) varies as (1 − δ )N−1
for multiplicity bin N. Monte Carlo simulations show that
“fake tracks” that could move events to higher multiplicity are
rare. We have observed no statistically signiﬁcant differences
in the shape distributions after adjusting the efﬁciency by the
constant per-track factor implied by the pull factor.

C. Long Track Efﬁciency Uncertainties

To ﬁrst order, the efﬁciency for reconstructing tracks with
length > 75 cm is not expected to affect the observed multi-

Pandora better deﬁne a vertex, and thus increases the chance
that the event passes the νµ CC selection ﬁlter.

We estimate the size of this effect by comparing the efﬁcien-
cies obtained with the Pandora package for simulated quasi-
elastic ﬁnal states in which both the proton and muon are re-
constructed, to charged pion resonance ﬁnal states in which the
proton, pion, and muon are all reconstructed. From this study
we conclude that the efﬁciency for ﬁnding the muon in ﬁnal
states where all charged particles are reconstructed could be
up to 3% higher for charged pion resonance events (observed
multiplicity 3) than quasi-elastic events (observed multiplicity
2). We then assume, for the purpose of uncertainty estima-
tion, that this relative enhancement seen for higher observed
multiplicity events in the MC is absent in the data.

Table VIII summarizes this study. Effects are generally
small compared to those seen in Table VII. No dependence on
GENIE variant is found.

D. Background Model Uncertainties

In the signal extraction ﬁtting procedure, two conditional
parameters (αν and αCR) were extracted from the Monte Carlo
simulation and off-beam data. To calculate the systematic un-
certainties on these parameters, their values were varied by
±1σ of their statistical uncertainty. Those values were prop-
agated in the observed charged particle multiplicity distribu-

13

tion. We also extracted the αν and αCR values separately from
the GENIE default, GENIE+TEM, and GENIE+MEC models.
The effect from this systematic variation were found to be very
small.

E. Flux Shape Uncertainties

Variations in ﬂux can be parameterized by

Φ (Eν ) → (1 + ∆ (Eν )) Φ (Eν ) ,

(28)

where Φ (Eν ) is the neutrino ﬂux at neutrino energy Eν and
∆ (Eν ) is the fractional uncertainty in the ﬂux at that energy.
An energy-independent ∆ (Eν ) has no effect on the observed
multiplicity distributions as this measurement is independent
of absolute normalization. On the other hand, raising the high
energy ﬂux relative to the low energy ﬂux could enhance the
contributions of higher multiplicity resonance and DIS pro-
cesses. We conﬁne ourself to considering highly correlated
energy-dependent shifts, denoted as ∆i (Eν ) for i = 1 − 6 via
an approximate procedure that should be conservative. These
shifts, shown in Fig. 10, are allowed to modify the BNB ﬂux
within uncertainties determined by the MiniBooNE collabora-
tion [20]. The ﬁrst two variations simply shift all ﬂux val-
ues up (∆1 (Eν )) or down (∆2 (Eν )) according to the ﬂux un-
certainty envelope. The next two enhance the high energy
ﬂux (∆3 (Eν )) or low energy ﬂux (∆4 (Eν )) linearly with neu-
trino energy, with the variation taken to be zero at the aver-
age neutrino energy. The ﬁnal two variations enhance high
energy ﬂux (∆5 (Eν )) or low energy ﬂux (∆6 (Eν )) logarithmi-
cally with neutrino energy, with the variation taken to be zero
at the average energy. As expected, shifts that are positively
correlated across all energies produce negligible differences,
but even shifts that produce sizable distortions between high
and low energies contribute systematic uncertainties that are
small.

i = 1 − 6. The variations ∆1 (Eν ) and ∆2 (Eν ) deﬁne the
envelope of ﬂux uncertainties for the BNB.

The measured charge from muon-induced ionization can
vary within the detector volume due to the ﬁnite probability
for drifting electrons to be captured by electronegative con-
taminants in the liquid argon. This capture probability can be
parameterized by an electron lifetime τ. We perform our anal-
ysis on simulation with two lifetimes that safely bound those
measured during detector operating conditions, τ = 6 msec
and τ = ∞ msec. The resulting distribution of percentage un-
certainty as a function of multiplicity in Fig. 9 shows that the
electron lifetime uncertainties minimally affect the multiplic-
ity.

G. Other Sources of Uncertainty Considered

A systematic comparison was performed on all kinematic
quantities entering this analysis between off-beam CR data
and the CR events simulated with CORSIKA. No statistically
signiﬁcant discrepancies were observed between event selec-
tion pass rates applied to off-beam data and MC simulation.

A check of possible time-dependent detector response sys-
tematics was also performed by dividing the data into two sam-
ples and performing the analysis separately for each sample.
Differences between the two samples are consistent within sta-
tistical ﬂuctuations.

The data are not corrected for νµ NC, νe, ¯νe, or ¯νµ back-
grounds. An assumption is made that the Monte Carlo sim-
ulation adequately describes these non νµ CC backgrounds.
Section IX A shows that these backgrounds, in total, are ex-
pected to be less than 10% of the ﬁnal sample; their impact on
the ﬁnal distributions is generally small.

VIII. RESULTS

A. Observed Charged Particle Multiplicity Distribution

Following the implementation of the signal extraction pro-
cedure and veriﬁcation through closure test on MC events, we
execute the same maximum likelihood ﬁt on data. Table IV
lists the values of the ﬁt parameters obtained for the data; and
Table IX lists the number of neutrino events in different mul-
tiplicity bins for the data. While our method does not require
this to be the case, we note that the ﬁtted PH and MCS test
probabilities P(PH), Q(PH), P(MCS), and Q(MCS) agree
in data and simulation within statistical uncertainties. This
provides evidence that the simulation correctly describes the
muon PH and MCS tests used in the analysis.

from three different GENIE predictions overlaid on data are
presented in Fig. 11 where data error bars include statistical
uncertainties obtained from the ﬁt and the MC error bands in-
clude MC statistical and systematic uncertainties that are listed
in Table VI added in quadrature.

In general the three GENIE models agree within uncertain-
ties with one another, and agree qualitatively with the data.
There are indications that GENIE overestimates the mean
charged particle multiplicity relative to the data. We empha-
size that no tuning or ﬁtting has been performed to this or any
of the other kinematic distributions.

B. Observed Kinematic Distributions

A key technical feature of our analysis entails perform-
ing tests on the pulse height and multiple Coulomb scat-
tering behavior of hits on the long contained track in each
event. This allows a categorization of events in each mul-
tiplicity into four categories according to whether the long
track passes or fails the PH and MCS tests: (PASS, PASS),
(PASS, FAIL), (FAIL, PASS), and (FAIL, FAIL). We have
shown that the (PASS, PASS) category is “neutrino-enriched”
and the (FAIL, FAIL) category is cosmic-ray-dominated. The
mixed cases (PASS, FAIL) and (FAIL, PASS) provide samples
with intermediate signal-to-background ratios.

Our ﬁt to the distribution of the eight event categories in
on-beam and off-beam data allows us to estimate the number
of neutrino events ˆNνi and the number of corresponding back-
ground CR events ˆNCRi for each observed multiplicity i. Once
ˆNνn and ˆNCRn are established, we can obtain a prediction for
the content of any bin k of any kinematic quantity Xi j asso-
ciated with track j in an observed multiplicity i event in any
(PH, MCS) test combination:

model (Xi j, PH, MCS)k = ˆNνi ˆxν,i j (PH, MCS)k + ˆNCRi ˆxCR,i j (PH, MCS)k .

(29)

Here ˆxν,i j (PH, MCS)k is an area-normalized histogram of Xi j
for “true neutrino events” in a given category obtained from

a “MC” sample, and ˆxCR,i j (PH, MCS)k is an area-normalized
histogram of Xi j for CR events obtained from off-beam data.

15

FIG. 11: Bin-by-bin normalized multiplicity distributions using 5 × 1019 POT MicroBooNE data compared with three GENIE
predictions (left) in linear scale, (right) in log scale. The data are CR background subtracted. Data error bars include statistical
uncertainties obtained from the ﬁt. Monte Carlo error bands include MC statistical uncertainties from the ﬁt and systematic
uncertainty contributions added in quadrature.

This distribution can be compared to the corresponding one
for data in each category, data(Xi j, PH, MCS)k.

In short, we assume that the observed distribution of events
consists of a mix of neutrino events plus CR events. The
proportions of the mix in each category are ﬁxed by the output
of our ﬁt, which, by construction, constrains the normalization
of the model to equal that of the data. We emphasize that only
the PH and MCS tests have been used to extract the neutrino
interaction signal sample; no information from any quantity
Xi j is used.

C. Checks on Distributions lacking Dynamical Signiﬁcance

Several kinematic properties of neutrino interactions de-
pend only weakly on the neutrino interaction model; these
include the reconstructed vertex positions, the initial and ﬁ-
nal coordinates of the long track, and the azimuthal angles of
individual tracks. These distributions provide checks on the
overall signal-to-background separation provided by the test-
category ﬁts and ﬂux and detector modeling. They also test for
differences between the modeling of neutrino events, which
depend on the GEANT detector simulation, and CR events,
which use the off-beam data and thus do not depend on detec-
tor simulation.

As an example, we show the observed distributions for the
selected vertex y position for the candidate muon track from
the full selected sample in Fig. 12. For this and all subse-
quent distributions, the on-beam data events are indicated by
plotted points with statistical error bars. The model predic-
tion is shown by a colored band (red for GENIE default, green
for GENIE+TEM, and blue for GENIE+MEC) with the width
of the band indicating the correlated statistical plus efﬁciency
systematic uncertainty from using common Nν,n, NCR,n values
for all bins of all distributions of a given multiplicity bin n.
The CR contribution to a distribution in a given category is
shown by the shaded cyan region. For example, Fig. 12 com-

pares the on-beam data to GENIE default MC sample and also
shows the CR background.

The signal-enriched (PASS, PASS) category for vertex y has
the nearly ﬂat distribution expected for a neutrino event sam-
ple with a small CR background. Note that in our selection,
we only allow candidate muon tracks initial y position < 70
cm. This cut rejects many cosmic rays that produce a down-
ward trajectory in the ﬁnal selected sample. The remaining
background is dominated by cosmic rays with an apparent up-
ward trajectory. This can be seen in the background-enriched
sample (FAIL, FAIL) in the vertex y distribution where a peak
at negative y values corresponds to “upwards-going”CR.

Figure 13 shows the distribution of azimuthal angle φ , de-
ﬁned in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction, of the
muon candidate track for the full selected sample. The CR-
dominated (FAIL, FAIL) category shows the expected peak-
ing at φ = ±π/2 from the mainly vertically-oriented CR. The
asymmetry in the peak’s structure is due to the requirement on
vertex y position described previously in Sec. V D. By contrast
the signal-enriched (PASS, PASS) category has the nearly ﬂat
distribution expected for a neutrino event sample with a small
CR background.

Similar levels of agreement exist between data and simula-
tion for distributions of the event vertex x and z positions, for
the (x, y, z) position of the end point of the muon track candi-
date, and for the azimuthal angles of individual tracks in mul-
tiplicity 2 and 3 topologies. We thus conclude that the simu-
lation and reconstruction chain augmented by our method for
estimated CR backgrounds satisfactorily describes features of
the data that have no dependence on the neutrino interaction
model.

neutrino interaction model. Azimuthal symmetry of the beam
eliminates one of these, leaving 3, 7, 11, and 15 dynamically
signiﬁcant variables for multiplicities 1 − 4, respectively. In
the following, we use the notation Xi j to label a dynamical
variable x associated with track j in an observed multiplicity i
event. For example, cos θ11 describes the cosine of polar angle
distribution of the only track in multiplicity 1 events, while
L22 would describe the length of the second (short) track in
multiplicity 2 events. The notation with three subscripts, Xi jk,
represents a distribution of the difference in variable x associ-
ated with tracks j and k in an observed multiplicity i event.

For one-track events, three variables exist. We use the ob-
served length L11 as a proxy for kinetic energy, and the co-
sine of the scattering angle with respect to the neutrino beam
direction cos θ11. The azimuthal angle φ11 has no dynami-
cal signiﬁcance and must be uniformly distributed due to the
cylindrical symmetry of the neutrino beam.

Since the particle mass is not determined in our analysis, we
are free to introduce a third dynamically signiﬁcant quantity
that is sensitive to particle mass, which we take to be

sin Θ11 = | ˆs11 × ˆt11| ,

(30)

where ˆs11 is a unit vector parallel to the track direction at the
event vertex, and ˆt11 is a unit vector that points from the start
of the track to the end of the track in the detector. The vari-
able Θi j measures the angular deﬂection of a track over its
length due to multiple Coulomb scattering. Its dependence on
track momentum and energy differs from that of track length.
For most of the MicroBooNE kinematic range, we expect light
particles (π and µ) to scatter more, and thus produce a broader
sin Θi j distribution, than protons over the same track length.

Figure 14 shows the distributions of L11, cos θ11, and
sin Θ11, from the neutrino-enriched sample compared to the
GENIE default model. Figure 15 presents the L11 distribu-
tion for the GENIE+MEC and GENIE+TEM models. This is
the distribution where the agreement between data and GE-
NIE+TEM model, compared to the agreement between data
and the other two models, is largest. Figure 16 presents the
cos θ11 distribution for GENIE+MEC and GENIE+TEM mod-
els. This is the distribution where the agreement between data
and the GENIE default compares least favorably than to the
GENIE+MEC and GENIE+TEM models.

For brevity in the following, except where noted, we only
show comparisons of data to predictions from the GENIE
default model.
Comparisons to GENIE+TEM and GE-
NIE+MEC show qualitatively similar levels of agreement.
Differences for speciﬁc distributions can be examined in terms
of the χ 2 test statistic values in Table X.

For two track events, seven dynamic variables exist. These
include properties of the long track that parallel the choices
for one-track events, L21, cos θ21, and sin Θ21, similar quanti-
ties for the second track, L22, cos θ22, and sin Θ22, plus a quan-
tity that describes the correlation between the two tracks in the
event, which we take to be the difference in azimuthal vari-
ables φ221 = φ22 − φ21. Since track 2 can exit the detector,
the meaning of L22 and sin Θ22 differ somewhat from L21 and
sin Θ21. Two other two-track correlated variables of interest,

17

which are not independent, are the cosine of the opening angle,

cos Ω221 = cos θ21 cos θ22 + sin θ21 sin θ22 cos (φ22 − φ21) ,

and the cosine of the acoplanarity angle

cos θA =

ˆs21 · (ˆz × ˆs21)
|ˆz × ˆs21|

= sin θ21 sin (φ22 − φ21) ,

(31)

(32)

(33)

with ˆz a unit vector in the neutrino beam direction and ˆs21 is
a unit vector parallel to the ﬁrst track direction at the event
vertex. For the scattering of two initial state particles into two
ﬁnal state particles (2 → 2), one expects from momentum con-
servation φ221 = ±π and cos θA = 0. Deviations of φ221 from
±π or of cos θA from 0 could be caused by undetected tracks
in the ﬁnal state, from NC events in the sample, or from effects
of ﬁnal state interactions in CC events.

The opening angle serves a useful role in identifying spu-
rious two-track events that result from the tracking algo-
rithm “breaking” a single track into two tracks, most com-
monly in cosmic ray events. Broken tracks produce values
of cos Ω221 very close to −1. Figures 17 and 18 show the
distributions of (L21 and L22) and (cos θ21 and cos θ22) from
the neutrino-enriched sample, compared to the GENIE default
model. Figure 19 presents the distributions of cos θ21 using
GENIE+MEC and GENIE+TEM models. This is the distri-
bution where the agreement between data and GENIE default
model, compared to the agreement between data and the other
two models, is largest. Figures 20 and 21 show the distribu-
tions of (sin Θ21 and sin Θ22) and (φ22 −φ21 and cos Ω221) from
the neutrino-enriched sample, compared to the GENIE default
model. We have performed a test where we remove all events
in the ﬁrst bin of Fig. 21; we see no changes in the level of
agreement between data or model in other kinematic distribu-
tion comparisons, and no statistically signiﬁcant shifts in the
observed multiplicity distributions.

For three-track events, eleven dynamic variables exist. A
straightforward continuation of the previous choices leads to
the choice of L31, cos θ31, sin Θ31, L32, cos θ32, sin Θ32, φ32 −
φ31, L33, cos θ33, sin Θ33, and φ33 − φ31 as the eleven variables.
Other azimuthal angle difference such as

φ32 − φ33 = (φ32 − φ31) − (φ33 − φ31)

(34)

are not independent.
Figures 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27
show the distributions of (L31, L32, and L33), (cos θ31, cos θ32,
and cos θ33), (sin Θ31, sin Θ32, and sin Θ33), (φ32 − φ31 and
cos Ω321), (φ33 − φ31 and cos Ω331), (φ32 − φ33 and cos Ω323)
from the neutrino-enriched sample, compared to the GENIE
default model.

E. χ 2 Tests for Kinematic Distributions

We quantify agreement between model and observation
through use of χ 2 tests on the kinematic distributions de-
scribed in Sec. VIII D. Ensemble tests have established the
validity of the use of the χ 2 criterion. We use only the
“neutrino-enriched” sample of events in which the candidate
muon passes both the PH and MCS tests. Data are binned

Table X summarizes the results of these χ 2 comparison tests
for 21 independent kinematic variables to the three GENIE
models. Only bins with at least one data event and one model
event were used in the calculation of χ 2. The number of de-
grees of freedom associated with the χ 2 test was set equal to
the number of bins used for that histogram minus one to ac-
count for the overall normalization adjustment. We note here
that these tests for consistency are deﬁned at the level of sta-
tistical uncertainties only; systematic uncertainties are not in-
corporated into the χ 2 terms.

We summarize here salient features of Table X as fol-
lows: All three models consistently describe the data, with
summed χ 2 per degree-of-freedom (χ 2/DOF) of 228.1/216,
216.9/216, and 229.6/216, respectively, and corresponding
p-values of Pχ 2 = 27%, 47%, and 25% for GENIE default,
MEC, and TEM, respectively. The total χ 2 after including all
dynamic and non-dynamic variable distributions is 714/652.
No tune of GENIE is superior to any other with any meaning-
ful statistical signiﬁcance for the distributions we have con-
sidered. The acceptable values of χ 2 are consistent with the
hypothesis that the combination of a GENIE event genera-
tor, the MicroBooNE BNB ﬂux model, and the MicroBooNE
GEANT-based detector simulation satisfactorily describe the
properties of neutrino events examined in this analysis in a
shape comparison. All elements of the MicroBooNE analysis

chain thus appear to be performing satisfactorily; and no evi-
dence exists for missing systematic effects that would produce
data-model discrepancies outside the present level of statistics.
Aggregating Table X different ways uncovers no signiﬁ-
cant discrepancies. The χ 2 tests on leading track cos θ and
sin Θ yield satisfactory results for all multiplicities. Com-
bined χ 2/DOF for all distributions associated with a partic-
ular multiplicity likewise exhibit adequate agreement. The
most poorly described single distribution is that for the length
of the muon candidate in multiplicity 1 events. The Pχ 2,
while acceptable, are 16% and 8% for the GENIE default and
GENIE+MEC, respectively. The GENIE+TEM model has
Pχ 2 = 53%.

The χ 2 values for different distributions in a given multi-
plicity are calculated using the same events, which gives rise
to concerns about correlations between different distributions.
We have performed studies that verify that the χ 2 values would
be highly correlated if the model and data disagreed by an
overall normalization, but that otherwise the χ 2 tests on dif-
ferent distributions exhibit independent behavior, even when
the same events are used. The Pχ 2 values for different distri-
butions do not cluster near 0 or 1, which is consistent with the
view that the projections display approximately independent
statistical behavior.

In summary, all GENIE models successfully describe,

24

through χ 2 tests, the shapes of a complete set of dynamically
signiﬁcant kinematic variables for observed charged particle
multiplicity distributions 1, 2, and 3. The statistical power–
the highest precision afforded by the available statistics with
which the predictions can be tested–of these tests from the
overall data statistics available corresponds to approximately
4%, 7%, and 20% for multiplicity 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

corporate only statistical uncertainties, the situation differs for
the overall multiplicity distribution. Here, we ﬁnd statisti-
cal χ 2
M/DOF= 30/4, 22/4, and 28/4 for the default, MEC,
and TEM GENIE models, respectively. However, in the case
of multiplicity, a signiﬁcant systematic uncertainty exists for
tracking efﬁciency that must be taken into account before any
conclusion can be drawn.

F. χ 2 Tests for Multiplicity Distribution

While we ﬁnd satisfactory agreement between GENIE mod-
els and kinematic distribution shapes using χ 2 tests that in-

We incorporate a tracking efﬁciency contribution to the χ 2

test by deﬁning

.

Here Di is the number of neutrino events estimated by the sig-
nal extraction procedure (Sec. VIII B), and σi is the estimated
uncertainty on Di using the signal extraction procedure. For
multiplicity 3 and higher, the uncertainty on Di is purely sta-
tistical as the CR background becomes negligible. The quan-
tities Mi are the number of events in the MC sample with mul-
tiplicity i. Finite statistics in the MC sample are incorporated
by interpreting the Mi as Poisson ﬂuctuations about their true
values ˆM (0)i in the third term of Eq. 38. This analysis does
not absolutely normalize MC to data, hence the relative nor-
malization of data to MC is allowed to ﬂoat via the parameter
K in the ﬁrst term of Eq. 38. The normalization constant K,
while not used directly in the model test, is consistent with the
predicted value from the default GENIE model.

As discussed in Sec. VII B, changing the per-track efﬁ-
ciency by a constant fraction δ in the model would shift events
between multiplicities according to

(cid:3) (1 − δ )3 ,

ˆM (δ )4 = (cid:2) ˆM (0)4
ˆM (δ )3 = (cid:2) ˆM (0)3 + 3 ˆM (0)4 δ (cid:3) (1 − δ )2 ,
ˆM (δ )2 = (cid:2) ˆM (0)2 + 2 ˆM (0)3 δ + 3 ˆM (0)4 δ 2(cid:3) (1 − δ ) ,
ˆM (δ )1 = (cid:2) ˆM (0)1 + ˆM (0)2 δ + ˆM (0)3 δ 2 + ˆM (0)4 δ 3(cid:3) .

(42)

For the nominal model used in the MC simulation δ = 0. As
discussed in Sec. VII B we estimate the uncertainty on δ to be
15%, and we introduce this into χ 2
M through the “pull term”
(δ /0.15)2.

We minimize χ 2

M with respect to the tracking efﬁciency pull
parameter δ , the MC-to-data normalization K, and the ﬁve MC

statistical quantities ˆM (0)i, i = 1 − 5. This procedure yields

χ 2
M/DOF = 6.4/3 (default), 4.3/3 (MEC), 5.8/3 (TEM),

(43)

δ = 0.32 (default), 0.27 (MEC), 0.32 (TEM).

(44)

We ﬁnd that a satisfactory χ 2 value can be obtained for the
multiplicity distribution itself, albeit at the cost of a ≈ 2σ pull
in the parameter δ .

IX. DISCUSSION

A. GENIE Predictions for Observed Multiplicity

At BNB energies, the nominal GENIE expectations for
charged particle multiplicities at the neutrino interaction point
are ≈ (80%) n = 2 (from quasi-elastic scattering, νµ n → µ − p,
neutral pion resonant production νµ n → µ −R+ → µ − pπ 0,
and coherent pion production νµ Ar → µ −π +Ar); ≈ (20%)
n = 3 (resonant charged pion production νµ p → µ −R++ →
µ − pπ +); and ≈ (1%) n ≥ 4 (from multi-particle production
processes referred to as DIS). However, ﬁnal state interactions
(FSI) of hadrons produced in neutrino scattering with the ar-
gon nucleus can subtract or add charged particles that emerge
from within the nucleus. These multiplicities are further mod-
iﬁed by the selection criteria.

The following list summarizes qualitative expectations for
components of observed multiplicities from particular pro-
cesses. These components can include contributions from
the primary neutrino-nucleon scatter within the nucleus and
secondary interactions of primary hadrons with the remnant
Secondary charged particles are usually protons,
nucleus.
which are expected to be produced with kinetic energies that

are usually too low for track reconstruction in this analysis.
However, more energetic forward-produced protons from the
upper “tail” of this secondary kinetic energy distribution may
contribute. Note that the particle-type-dependent kinetic en-
ergy thresholds for charged particles entering our sample range
from 31 MeV for a π ± to 69 MeV for a proton.

• Multiplicity > 3, mainly predicted to be “DIS events”
in which at least three short tracks are reconstructed.
“DIS” is the usual term for multi-particle ﬁnal states not
identiﬁed with any particular resonance formation.

• Multiplicity = 3, mainly predicted to be µ − pπ + events
from ∆ resonance production in which all three tracks
are reconstructed. “Feed down” from higher multiplic-
ity would be small due to the relatively small DIS cross
section at MicroBooNE energies.

• Multiplicity = 2, mainly predicted to be QE µ − p
events and resonant µ − pπ 0 events in which the proton
is reconstructed, with a sub-leading contribution from
“feed down” of resonant charged pion production events
where one track fails to be reconstructed.

• Multiplicity = 1, mainly predicted to be “feed down”
from QE µ − p and µ − pπ 0 events in which the proton is
not reconstructed, with contributions from other higher
multiplicity topologies in which more than one track
fails to be reconstructed.

Figure 28 illustrates these expectations from GENIE. We
note that, as expected,
the three-track topology is domi-
nated by resonant pion production in the default GENIE
model, while the two-track and one-track topologies are QE-
dominated with non-negligible resonance feed-down. The co-
herent pion production process (νµ + Ar → µ −π ++ Ar) de-
noted by “CCCohP” in this ﬁgure, as well as NC and νe and
¯νe scattering, only lead to small contributions.

Our observation of discrepancy of data compared to simu-
lation in three-track compared to two-track topologies, shown
in Fig. 11, is qualitatively similar to the low νµ CC pion cross
sections compared to GENIE reported by MINERvA [38] us-
ing hydrocarbon targets at the somewhat higher neutrino en-
ergy from the Fermilab Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI)
beam.
The T2K experiment [39] also reports a low pion
production cross section relative to GENIE expectations us-
ing water targets in a neutrino beam with comparable energy
to the BNB. However, MiniBooNE measured a charged pion
production rate more in agreement with GENIE using mineral
oil as a target in the same Fermilab BNB as used by Micro-
BooNE [40].

MicroBooNE also observes more one-track events than GE-
NIE predicts, as shown in Fig. 11. This corroborates Ar-
goNeuT’s observation that approximately 35% of neutrino in-
teractions on argon targets with no pions detected in the ﬁnal
state also contained no observable proton [41].

While our observed multiplicity distribution disagrees with
GENIE expectations and shows consistency with a number of
other experiments, we cannot, as noted in Sec. VIII F deﬁni-
tively exclude an alternate explanation of the discrepancy in
terms of a tracking efﬁciency error at this time.

25

Our kinetic energy thresholds limit acceptance in such a
way that protons produced in FSI may not signiﬁcantly con-
tribute to the observed CPMD. Furthermore, our analysis re-
quires a forward-going long contained track as a muon can-
didate, which restricts the ﬁnal state phase space. Also, our
analysis makes use of fully automated reconstruction. There-
fore, results of this analysis should not be directly compared
to the low energy proton multiplicity measurement reported by
ArgoNeuT [17].

B. GENIE Predictions for Kinematic Distributions

Kinematic distributions for ﬁxed multiplicity suffer much
less from tracking-related systematic uncertainties than the
multiplicity probabilities; hence GENIE expectations for the
shapes of kinematic distributions can be compared directly to
data. The MEC and TEM tunes of GENIE primarily change
the normalization of QE-like event topologies relative to res-
onance type topologies, and secondarily modify properties of
low energy ﬁnal state protons that would usually not satisfy
our acceptance criteria. Shape comparisons would thus not be
expected to differentiate MEC and TEM from the GENIE de-
fault, and we have veriﬁed this expectation with our χ 2 tests.
Accordingly we conﬁne the following discussion to the default
GENIE tune.

Figure 29 shows the predictions for reconstructed L11,
cos θ11, and sin Θ11 from the neutrino-enriched sample, using
the GENIE default model. The muon track candidate is only
mildly affected by the details of the recoiling hadronic system,
and thus QE, RES, and DIS production produce similar shape
contributions to L11, cos θ11, and sin Θ11.

Figures 30, 31, 32, and 33 present the distributions of re-
constructed (L21 and L22), (cos θ21 and cos θ22), (sin Θ21 and
sin Θ22), and (φ22 − φ21 and cos Ω221) respectively from the
neutrino-enriched sample, using the GENIE default model.
There is again minimal difference between QE, resonance, and
DIS channels in track length, cos θ , or sin Θ for the leading
track. However, the QE channel produces contributions to
the distributions in cos θ21 and cos θ22 that are considerably
less forward-peaked than the resonance channel contributions.
Distributions of these quantities in the data appear to be con-
sistent with this picture. We also note that the sin Θ22 distri-
bution receives a contribution from QE scattering peaked at
small values, consistent with expectations for a proton, and a
broader distribution more similar to that of the leading muon
track candidate that is consistent with the hypothesis that a
charged pion can be reconstructed as the second track in reso-
nance contributions.

Striking differences between QE and RES contributions ex-
ist in the φ22 −φ21 distribution between QE and resonance con-
tributions in the Fig. 33. The QE contributions demonstrate
the clear φ22 − φ21 = ±π peak expected for 2 → 2 scattering.
The gap between the ±π peaks is dominated by contributions
from resonance feed-down.

structed distributions of (L31, L32, and L33), (cos θ31, cos θ32,

inated by resonance contributions, and the data sample, al-
though of limited statistics, has a CR background consistent

X. SUMMARY

We have completed an analysis that compares observed
charged-particle multiplicities and observed kinematic distri-
butions of charged particles for ﬁxed multiplicities in a re-
stricted ﬁnal state phase space for neutrino scattering events
in argon to predictions from three GENIE tunes processed
through the MicroBooNE simulation and reconstruction chain.
Our analysis takes into account statistical uncertainties in a rig-
orous manner, and estimates the impact of the largest expected
systematic uncertainties. We observe that all elements of the
MicroBooNE measurement chain−detector performance, data
acquisition, event reconstruction, Monte Carlo event genera-
tor, detector simulation, and ﬂux modeling−perform well.

With particle-type-dependent kinetic energy thresholds of
31 MeV for π ± and 69 MeV for protons, we ﬁnd all three
GENIE tunes consistently describe data in the shapes of 26
different kinematic distributions at ﬁxed multiplicities. GE-
NIE appears to over-predict the number of three-track events
in data that would be expected from resonant pion production,
and to under-predict the number of one-track events; how-
ever, we cannot rule out a higher than expected tracking ef-
ﬁciency uncertainty as an alternative explanation for these ob-
servations. Our study thus empirically supports the use of
GENIE in describing single-process (quasi-elastic, resonance)
neutrino scattering on argon, but not the predictions for the rel-
ative contributions of different processes to the overall cross
section. We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences at this stage in the

experiment between the default GENIE tune or tunes that add
MEC or TEM. Use of any of the three GENIE tunes for fu-
ture MicroBooNE analyses, or for physics studies of inclusive
ﬁnal states performed for the SBN and DUNE experiments,
receives empirical validation from this work.

As part of this analysis, we have developed a data-driven
cosmic ray background estimation method based on the en-
ergy loss proﬁle and multiple Coulomb scattering behavior of
muons. Within the available Monte Carlo statistics, we have
shown that this method provides an unbiased estimate of the
number of neutrino events in a pre-ﬁltered sample, and, given
current statistical precision, it is independent of the signal-to-
background level, ﬁnal state charged particle multiplicity, and
other kinematic properties of the ﬁnal state particles. This
method can be applied to a broad range of charged current
process measurements.
