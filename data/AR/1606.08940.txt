ABSTRACT

−

Aims. We aim to study the spatial distribution of the physical and chemical properties of the X-ray emitting plasma of the supernova
remnant (SNR) G306.3
0.9 in detail to obtain constraints on its ionization stage, the progenitor supernova explosion, and the age of
the remnant.
Methods. We used combined data from XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories to study the X-ray morphology of G306.3
0.9
in detail. A spatially resolved spectral analysis was used to obtain physical and geometrical parameters of diﬀerent regions of the
remnant. Spitzer infrared observations, available in the archive, were also used to constrain the progenitor supernova and study the
environment in which the remnant evolved.
Results. The X-ray morphology of the remnant displays a non-uniform structure of semi-circular appearance, with a bright southwest
region and very weak or almost negligible X-ray emission in its northern part. These results indicate that the remnant is propagating in
a non-uniform environment as the shock fronts are encountering a high-density medium, where enhanced infrared emission is detected.
The X-ray spectral analysis of the selected regions shows distinct emission-line features of several metal elements, conﬁrming the
thermal origin of the emission. The X-ray spectra are well represented by a combination of two absorbed thermal plasma models:
one in equilibrium ionization (VAPEC) with a mean temperature of
0.19 keV, and another out of equilibrium ionization (VNEI)
at a higher temperature of
1.1 or 1.6–1.9 keV. For regions located in the northeast, central, and southwest part of the SNR, we
found elevated abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, typical of ejecta material. The outer regions located northwest and south show
values of the abundances above solar but lower than to those found in the central regions. This suggests that the composition of the
emitting outer parts of the SNR is a combination of ejecta and shocked material of the interstellar medium. The comparison between
the S/Si, Ar/Si, and Ca/Si abundances ratios (1.75, 1.27, and 2.72 in the central region, respectively), favor a Type Ia progenitor for
this remnant, a result that is also supported by an independent morphological analysis using the X-ray and 24 µm IR data.
Conclusions.

1. Introduction

The energetic phenomena of a supernova (SN) explosion pro-
duce a very profound impact on the interstellar medium (ISM)
because it imparts a large amount of mechanical energy and
heavy elements to the surrounding medium. The interaction of
the shock-front of supernova remnants (SNRs) with the environ-
ment greatly aﬀects the dynamic structure of the Galaxy. As a
result, we observe SNRs with diﬀerent types of morphologies
at radio, infrared (IR), and X-ray wavelengths. The study of the
SNR morphology at infrared and X-ray frequencies can be used
as a powerful observational diagnostic to distinguish between
progenitor types and to improve our knowledge of the physical
and chemical properties of the X-ray emitting plasma.

The canonical ways of identifying the SN progenitors are i)
to compare the ejecta abundances to the yields of SN models and
ii) examine the morphology. Recently, López et al. (2011) have
shown that the study of the X-ray morphology of SNRs can also
be used to constrain their progenitors. In this case, the X-ray line
and thermal continuum emission of Type Ia SNRs tend to be
more circular and mirror symmetric than core-collapse SNRs.
The observed diﬀerences in morphologies are large enough to
allow a clear separation of the two main explosion classes. This
result is a consequence of the diﬀerent geometries of the explo-
sion mechanisms and circumstellar environments of Type Ia and
core-collapse (CC) SNRs. Recently, Peters et al. (2013) have ex-
tended the technique using ratios between diﬀerent powers of
a multipole expansion to analyze IR images of SNRs to test
whether they can be classiﬁed using the symmetry of their warm
dust emission as well.

Therefore, with the information gathered from diﬀerent ob-
servational facilities available such as XMM-Newton, Chandra,
and Spitzer, it is possible to study a large number of SNRs in
great detail (Vink 2012) and to determine their progenitors. The
southern Galactic SNR G306.3–0.9 that was recently observed
by the Swift telescope (Reynolds et al. 2012), is an interesting
candidate to carry out this type of study, since the object displays
a complex morphology at IR frequencies, dominated by a bright
semicircular southern region (Reynolds et al. 2013), which cor-
relates very well with radio and X-ray emission observed by the
Chandra telescope with its high spatial resolution.

In this paper, we report on a detailed X-ray study of the SNR
G306.3–0.9 using the enhanced sensitivity of the XMM-Newton
and Chandra telescopes, which we complement with available
radio and IR data. The structure of the paper is as follows: in
Sect. 2 we describe the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations
and the data reduction. X-ray analysis and results are shown in
Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we discuss the implications of our results and,
ﬁnally, we summarize our main conclusions in Sect. 5.

2. X-ray observations and data reduction

We combined XMM-Newton and Chandra data to carry out a
detailed spectral and spatial X-ray analysis of SNR G306.3–
0.9. The XMM-Newton observation was performed with the
European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC), which consists of
three detectors, two MOS cameras (Turner et al. 2001), and one
PN camera (Strüder et al. 2001), operating in the 0.2
15 keV
range. The satellite was pointed to α= 13h21m44s.45 and
δ=
63◦34′34′′. 8 (J2000.0), with the SNR placed at the cen-
tral CCDs. XMM-Newton data were analyzed with the Sci-
ence Analysis System (SAS) version 14.0.0. Starting from
level-1 event ﬁles, the latest calibrations (Master Index File =
XMM
0191.CCF) available at Sep-02-2015 in the
CCF database, were applied with the emproc and epproc tasks.
The events were then ﬁltered to retain only photons likely for
X-ray events: patterns 0 to 4 and energies 0.2 to 15.0 keV for the
PN, patterns 0 to 12 and energies 0.2 to 12.0 keV for MOS1/2
instruments. To exclude strong background ﬂares, we extracted
light curves of the full ﬁeld of view for each camera above
10 keV, excluding intervals 3-σ above the mean count rate to
produce good-time interval (GTI) ﬁles.

Two observations from the Advanced CCD Image Spectrom-

10 keV range with high spatial resolution
operates in the 0.1

(version 4.7) and CALDB (version 4.6.7) packages by the chan-
dra_repro task. Detailed information of the X-ray observations

To perform the morphological analysis and select the regions for
the spatially resolved spectroscopy, we combined X-ray images
of EPIC MOS and PN to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)
by means of the emosaic SAS task to merge the images. The cor-
responding set of exposure maps for each camera was prepared
to account for spatial quantum eﬃciency and mirror vignetting
by running the SAS task eexmap. Exposure vignetting correc-
tions were performed by dividing the merged count image by
the corresponding merged exposure maps.

Because of the high spatial resolution and sensitivity of the
data set, we were able to examine the X-ray morphology of the
supernova remnant in detail. In Fig. 1 we show narrow-band im-
2.0 keV,
ages generated in the energy ranges 0.5
4.5 keV using the EPIC MOS 1/2 cameras, with super-
and 2.0
imposed 843 MHz radio contours (Whiteoak & Green 1996). In
the image, North is up and East is to the left. The SNR shows
a semi-circular and asymmetric X-ray morphology, with diﬀuse
X-ray emission predominantly located in the southern part of the
remnant, and very weak extended X-ray emission in the north-
ern region. In the southern region the images also reveal a typical

the source PS S at αJ2000.0=13h21m47s.8, δJ2000.0=
presents a

11 σ signiﬁcance above local background.
From the analysis of the X-ray images we found that the
source PS N is dominant in the soft X-ray band and is coincident
with the IR source 2MASS J13215916
6332255 (Cutri et al.
2003); the source PS S is dominant in the hard X-ray band and
displays X-ray characteristics typical of an active galactic nu-
cleus; and the source PS C is dominant in the medium X-ray
band and is marginally coincident with the IR source 2MASS
J13214960-6333360 (Cutri et al. 2003). Unfortunately, the low-
resolution radio data do not allow observing any point-like coun-
terpart. All of them are absent in the 843 MHz radio map.

To check whether CXOU J132149.8

633335 is a point-like
object, we searched for extended X-ray emission (i.e., a pulsar
wind nebula) that might be associated with the source. For this
purpose, we applied the srcextent tool of the CIAO software
package. As a result, the analysis shows that when we use radii
>
5 arcsec, the source extends to sizes of about 5 arcsec. Con-
∼
versely, when we use a radius of 4 arcsec, its size is 1.6 arc-
sec, which agrees with the PSF computed at the position of the
source.

3.2. X-ray spectral analysis

To analyze physical and chemical conditions of the X-ray emis-
sion in SNR G306.3–0.9 in detail, we extracted spectra from re-
gions with diﬀerent sizes, chosen on the basis of the morphology
observed in the X-ray images (see Fig. 3). After several tests, we
found that the best choice included ﬁve individual regions (NE,

The spectral analysis was performed using the XSPEC package

els: APEC, NEI, VNEI, PSHOCK, and VPSHOCK, each

we found that the best ﬁt for the individual regions is consis-
tent with a VAPEC with sub-solar abundances of Ne and Mg,
and a VNEI model (Borkowski et al. 2001), dominated by ele-
vated abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe. It is interesting to note
that the central region C and the SW region show a strong Fe
6.4 keV, typical of ejecta material, which is also present
line at
in the NE region. This two-component plasma model has two
electron temperatures, one associated with ejecta material with
a hot temperature kTVNEI and another related to swept-up ISM
medium with a lower temperature kTVAPEC. The X-ray parame-

ters of the best ﬁt to the diﬀuse emission spectra for the diﬀerent
regions are presented in Table 2.

The spatially resolved spectral analysis shows that the phys-
ical conditions of the plasma are not homogeneous throughout
the remnant. In spite of this, the values of column density (NH)
are consistent between each other within the errors, ranging from

of NH correspond to regions NE and C. Moreover, the values ob-

is at similar conditions throughout the SNR.

In the ejecta model, two diﬀerent sets of regions are distin-
guished. Regions NE, C, and SW show signiﬁcantly higher tem-
peratures and larger abundances than NW and S regions, which
seems to indicate that the ejecta in the central and northern part
of the SNR are rich in heavy elements while in regions closer to
the main shock front the metals are less abundant, thus suggest-
ing a higher concentration of heavy elements in the remnant inte-
rior. The relatively short ionization timescale (. 1011 cm−
3 s) in
all the regions conﬁrms that the ejecta component is far from the
equilibrium ionization throughout the source. Regions NW and
S display relatively higher values of the ionization timescale than
regions NE, C, and SW, whose ionization timescales are shorter,
3 s. The VNEI component dis-

S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and temperatures in the 1.6–1.9 keV range and
shorter ionization timescales for NE, C and SW regions, with en-
hanced abundances of those elements, indicating that the ejecta
is reheated as a consequence of a reverse shock acting on the
inner regions of the SNR.

The spatial variation of Si, S, and Fe in the global morphol-
ogy of the SNR is also observed in the equivalent width maps

Article number, page 6 of 8

shown in Fig. 6. This image was obtained using narrow energy
ranges of 1.75–1.95 keV, 2.3–2.6 keV, and 6.2–6.8 keV for Si (in
red), S (in green), and Fe (in blue) lines, respectively. The maps
reﬂect the non-uniformity in the spatial distribution of the ele-
ments, which are mostly concentrated in the southern semicircu-
lar region. To obtain the equivalent widths for each of the XMM-
Newton EPIC cameras, we followed a standard procedure. We
obtained images in wider continuum bands of (1.5–2.1 keV) for
Si, (2.1–2.8 keV) for S and (5.5–7.5) for Fe, which include the
narrow line bands described above. We scaled them by a factor
corresponding to the ratio of the ﬂux in that band to the ﬂux in
the line band from the continuum spectral model assuming the
results obtained for the central region. Using this number, we ob-
tained images corresponding to the continuum below each line,
which we then subtracted from the line images to keep only the
line contribution. The equivalent width maps show more clearly
the stratiﬁcation of Fe concentrated in a ridge of emission toward
the center of the remnant, as has been noted by Reynolds et al.
(2013), which is also coincident with the bright ridge observed
at radio wavelengths by MOST. None of the point-like sources
detected within the SNR display typical characteristics of the
so-called central compact objects (CCO, see Halpern & Gotthelf
2010, for a review on their properties) according to our spectral
X-ray analysis.

Finally, it is interesting to note that although our ﬁt for the
individual regions is consistent with those from Reynolds et al.
(2013) using Chandra observations, the spatially resolving spec-
tral analysis allowed us to pinpoint inhomogeneities in the X-ray
emitting plasma. Therefore, it is evident that large-exposure ob-
servations and the simultaneous use of the improved eﬀective
area from XMM-Newton and spatial resolution from Chandra
plays an important role in mapping small-scale spectral changes
in this SNR.

4. Discussion

−

The X-ray morphology and global spectral properties of SNR
G306.3
0.9 were ﬁrst investigated in previous studies using lim-
ited Chandra observations (Reynolds et al. 2013). Thanks to the
large spectral eﬀective area of the instruments onboard XMM-
Newton, together with a deeper Chandra observation with high
spatial resolution and Spitzer data available at the archive, we
were able to develop a detailed morphological and spatially re-
solved spectral X-ray analysis, which is required to outline a
realistic astrophysical scenario that can describe the remnant’s
evolution and to understand the properties derived from a multi-
wavelength study.

Our results show that the X-ray morphology of the rem-
nant displays several interesting characteristics, which comprise
a southern semicircular brightened structure of X-ray emission
with a northern part of fainter emission. Its semicircular global
morphology is also consistent with radio and IR observations, as
previously noted by Reynolds et al. (2013).

−

In Fig. 7 we present the mid-IR emission at 24 µm of
0.9. A comparison with the X-ray images shows a
G306.3
strong correlation of the two emissions, as is usually found in
SNRs (Morton et al. 2007; Arendt et al. 2010; Williams et al.
2011; Dubner et al. 2013). The 24 µm emission is dominated
by thermal continuum emission of dust, most likely very small,
stochastically heated dust grains (Draine 2003). The abundance
of small grains in SNRs is probably due to the dust shattering
generated by the shock fronts (Andersen et al. 2011), which then
are heated by electrons and X-ray photons within the hot thermal
gas.

On the other hand, the fact that in the central part of the
remnant the Fe abundance is high favors the possibility of a
Type Ia SN origin. This is also consistent with the S/Si, Ar/Si,
and Ca/Si abundances ratio (1.75, 1.27, and 2.72 in the cen-
tral region, respectively), which are broadly in accordance with
a degenerate scenario and are highly inconsistent with any
core-collapse model (Nomoto et al. 1997). Moreover, following
Yamaguchi et al. (2014), we obtained the centroid of the Fe-K
line in the central region of the SNR. As a result, by ﬁtting a
power law to the continuum emission in the 5–8 keV energy
range plus a Gaussian for the emission line, we estimated a
centroid of 6.52
0.01 keV, which also agrees with a Type Ia
scenario. This possibility can be independently supported using
the morphological analysis proposed by López et al. (2011) and
Peters et al. (2013), who used the asymmetry of X-ray and 24 µm
IR emissions to classify the SNR as Type Ia or core-collapse
(CC). This technique is independent of the plasma conditions
and easy to perform. It is based on the power-ratio method
(PRM), which gives quantitative values of asymmetries in im-
ages by obtaining the multipole moments of the corresponding
surface brightness in a circular aperture (see López et al. 2011,
for a detailed description).

±

When we assume that the origin of the moments lies in the
centroid of the image (see green cross in Fig. 7, which corre-
sponds to Spitzer data), the dipole power approaches zero, but
the normalized quadrupole power P2/P0 measures the ellipticity
of the distribution, while the octupole power P3/P0 character-
izes the mirror asymmetry of the source. Following López et al.
(2011), in our case we used the soft band (0.5-2.1 keV) and Si xiii
emission line (1.75–2.0 keV) for X-ray images of SNR G306.3–
0.9 from Chandra ACIS camera. We also applied the method to
the 24 µm IR image from the Multiband Imaging Photometer
(MIPS; Rieke (2004)) in the Spitzer telescope. Background was
extracted and the multipole powers were calculated referring to

the centroid of each image (diﬀerences in X-ray centroids are
within the 0.5 arcsec ACIS resolution, while the distance be-
15 arcsec). As

Finally, using the information obtained from the spectral
analysis, we can roughly compute the electron density of the
plasma and age of the diﬀerent regions of the SNR. Assuming
that the plasma ﬁlls ellipsoidal regions like that used to extract
the spectra (indicated in Fig. 3), we obtained a volume ¯V for each
10 kpc range. Thus,
region of the SNR for distances in the 6
based on the emission measure (EM) determined by the spectral
ﬁtting (see Table 2), we estimated the plasma electron density by
ne= √EM/V. As a result, assuming a ﬁlling factor, f
1, and
considering an average between the elliptical semi-axes for the
unknown length of the ellipsoids along the line of sight, for the
regions NE, NW, C, SW, and S we obtained mean electron den-
3, respectively. In
sities of 0.31, 1.12, 0.60, 0.85, and 2.75 cm−
addition, considering a sphere with the same radius as the pro-
jected SNR and using the length of the chord intercepted by each
ellipsoidal region, we obtain upper limits for their volumes and
thus lower limits for their densities of 0.19, 0.69, 0.43, 0.42, and
3 for the NE, NW, C, SW, and S regions, respectively.
1.41 cm−
In all cases, the number density of the nucleons was simply as-
sumed to be the same as that of the electrons. Hence, despite all
the uncertainties inherent to these calculations, the densities esti-
mated in the NW and S external parts of the SNR are higher than
those found for the internal and N regions. Using the ionization
timescale τ of Table 2, we found that the elapsed time t = τ/ne
1300 yr. These values
after the plasma was heated is
∼
agree very well with the age obtained by Reynolds et al. (2013),
adopting a Sedov model (Sedov 1959).

5. Conclusions

We have used deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of
SNR G306.3–0.9 to study the properties of its X-ray emission
and its physical connection with radio and IR observations in
detail. The global X-ray morphology reveals a semi-circular X-
ray shape, with clear stratiﬁcations of Fe concentrated in a ridge
of emission toward the center of the remnant. This emission is
coincident with the bright ﬁlament observed at IR wavelengths.
Spectral analysis conﬁrmed that the physical conditions of
the emitting plasma are inhomogeneous throughout the remnant.
The X-ray spectral analysis of the individual regions showed
emission-line features of metal elements, conﬁrming the ther-
mal origin of the emission. The X-ray spectra are reasonably
well represented by two absorbed VAPEC and VNEI thermal
plasma models, with temperatures in the range of 0.17–0.21
keV for the VAPEC model, corresponding to emission arising
from the shocked ISM and a VNEI component with tempera-
1.1 keV and long ionization timescales for the NW and
tures
S external regions, with moderate abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca,
and Fe, and temperatures in the 1.6–1.9 keV range and shorter
ionization timescales for NE, C, and SW regions, with enhanced
abundances of those elements, indicating that the ejecta has been
excited to X-ray emitting temperatures by a reverse shock acting
on the inner regions of the SNR. The values of abundances found
in the central region of G306.3–0.9 and the centroid of the Fe-

K line favor a Type Ia progenitor for this remnant. The outer
regions show values of the abundances above solar but lower
than to those found in the central regions. This suggests that the
composition is a combination of ejecta and shocked ISM mate-
rial. Moreover, an independent morphological study performed
on the IR and Chandra X-ray data also suggests a Type Ia origin.
Deeper dedicated observations both in radio and X-ray wave-
lengths are required to search for a compact remnant immersed
in the bright thermal plasma emission from this young SNR.
