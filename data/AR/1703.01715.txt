Background The hyperon impurity eﬀect in nuclei has been extensively studied in diﬀerent mean-ﬁeld models. Recently,
there is a controversy about whether the Λ hyperon is more tightly bound in the normal deformed (ND) states than that
in the superdeformed (SD) states.

Purpose This article is aimed to provide a beyond-mean-ﬁeld study of the low-lying states of hypernuclei with shape coexistence

and to shed some light on the controversy.

Method The models of relativistic mean-ﬁeld and beyond based on a relativistic point-coupling energy functional are adopted
to study the low-lying states of both 37
Λ Ar and 36Ar. The wavefunctions of low-lying states are constructed as a superpo-
sition of a set of relativistic mean-ﬁeld states with diﬀerent values of quadrupole deformation parameter. The projections
onto both particle number and angular momentum are considered.

Results The Λ binding energies in both ND and SD states of 37

Λ Ar are studied in the case of the Λ hyperon occupying s, p, or
d state in the spherical limit, respectively. For comparison, four sets of nucleon-hyperon point-coupling interactions are
used respectively. Moreover, the spectra of low-lying states in 36Ar and 37
Λs Ar are calculated based on the same nuclear
energy density functional. The results indicate that the SD states exist in 37
Λ Ar for all the four eﬀective interactions.
Furthermore, the Λs reduces the quadrupole collectivity of ND states to a greater extent than that of SD states. For
37
Λ Ar, the beyond-mean-ﬁeld decreases the Λs binding energy of the SD state by 0.17 MeV, but it almost has no eﬀect
on that of the ND state.

Conclusions In 37

Λs Ar, the Λp and Λd binding energies of the SD states are always larger than those of the ND states. For Λs,
the conclusion depends on the eﬀective nucleon-hyperon interaction. Moreover, the beyond-mean-ﬁeld model calculation
indicates that the Λs hyperon is less bound in the SD state than that in the ND state.

INTRODUCTION

The hyperon impurity eﬀect in nuclear matter and
atomic nuclei has attracted lots of attention since the
ﬁrst discovery of Λ hypernuclei by Danysz and Pniewski
in 1953 [1, 2]. A hyperon does not suﬀer from Pauli ex-
clusion principle from nucleons and thus it can go deeply
into the interior of nuclei and change remarkably nu-
clear properties (see, for example, Ref. [3] for a brief re-
view). Previously, numerous studies have demonstrated
that the presence of a Λ hyperon may soften the equa-
tion of state of nuclear matter in neutron stars [4] and
changes nuclear structure signiﬁcantly, such as nuclear
shapes and sizes [5–9], collective excitations [10–15], neu-
tron driplines [16, 17], and ﬁssion barrier heights [18].

Shape coexistence exists universally in the nuclei
throughout nuclear chart. For the nuclei around A ∼ 40
mass region, the coexistence of both ND and SD states
was found in 36Ar [19, 20], 40Ca [21], and 44Ti [22],
respectively. The structure of these states was stud-

Λ Sc [33].

ied in details theoretically [23–32]. In recent years, the
Λ impurity eﬀect on these nuclei has been studied in
diﬀerent mean-ﬁeld based models. The extended an-
tisymmetrized molecular dynamics model for hypernu-
clei (HyperAMD) predicted that the SD states exist in
Λ Ca and 46
41
In particular, the calculation in-
dicates that the Λ hyperon in the SD states is more
bound than that in ND states. This study has gener-
ated a series of studies on hypernuclear SD states both
in a non-relativistic framework [34, 35] and a relativis-
tic framework [36]. However, whether the Λ separation
energy of the SD states is larger or smaller than that
of the ND states is still a open question. For 37
Λ Ar,
the HyperAMD model [34] and the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
(SHF) approach [35] predicted a smaller Λ separation en-
ergy of the SD state, while the relativistic mean-ﬁeld ap-
proach based on the meson-exchange (RMF-ME) eﬀec-
tive nucleon-nucleon (N N ) and nucleon-hyperon (N Λ)
interactions with a ﬁnite-range separable pairing inter-
action [37–39] gave an opposite conclusion [36]. Accord-
ing to Ref. [36], the larger Λ binding energy in the SD
state origin from a strong ring-shaped clustering struc-
ture which leads to a larger interaction energy between
the nuclear core and the valence hyperon.

Encouraged by the above discussion, we use the rela-
tivistic mean-ﬁeld approach and beyond based on a point-

 
 
 
 
 
 
coupling nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hyperon eﬀective
interactions to study the eﬀect of hyperon in 37
Λ Ar. The
paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy de-
scribe the point-coupling relativistic mean-ﬁeld and be-
yond approach for single-Λ hypernuclei. The numerical
details are given in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we present the
results for the normal deformed (ND) and superdeformed
(SD) states in 37
Λ Ar. Finally, a summary of our work is
given in Sec. V.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. Relativistic mean-ﬁeld model

The mean-ﬁeld states are obtained by the triaxially de-
formed relativistic mean-ﬁeld model with point-coupling
(RMF-PC) for Λ hypernuclei. For details, please refer to
Ref. [12]. Here, we just present an outline of this model.
The RMF-PC model for Λ hypernuclei starts from an

eﬀective Lagrangian density

L = Lfree + Lem + LN N + LN Λ,

(1)

where the ﬁrst term Lfree denotes the free Lagrangian
density of hypernuclear system. The second term Lem
is an electromagnetic part for protons. The third term
LN N takes the standard form [40] for the nucleon-nucleon
eﬀective interaction. The last term LN Λ for nucleon-
hyperon eﬀective interaction is chosen as the form pro-
posed in Ref. [41].

From the Lagrangian density Eq. (1), one obtains
the corresponding energy density function ERMF at the
mean-ﬁeld level, which can be decomposed into two parts:
the pure nucleonic part EN
RMF and the other part due to
the presence of Λ hyperon EΛ

the time-like component of electromagnetic ﬁeld and ρ(p)

B. Generator coordinate method with quantum
number projections

The wavefunctions for the low-lying states of hyper-
nuclei are constructed as the superpositions of a set of
quadrupole deformed hypernucler mean-ﬁeld states with
particle number and angular momentum projection. This
framework is known as PNAMP+GCM scheme and has
been developed in Ref. [15] for the hypernuclear systems
composed of a Λ hyperon and an even-even nuclear core.

HWG equation (15) provides the energy EJ

Because we begin with an energy functional rather than
a Hamiltonian, we replace the Hamiltonian overlap with
the energy functional in which the diagonal densities and
currents are replaced with mixed ones [42, 43].

We note that this framework has been applied to the
low-lying nuclear states if the reference states in Eq. (14)
are from the RMF-PC calculation for nuclei [43, 44].

III. NUMERICAL DETAILS

In the RMF-PC calculation, parity, x-simplex sym-
metry, and time-reversal invariance are imposed. The

3

densities are invariant under the reﬂection with respect
to the three planes x-y, x-z, and y-z. The Dirac equa-
tion Eq. (10) is solved by expanding the large and small
components of the Dirac spinors ψB
k (r) separately on the
basis of eigenfunctions of a three-dimensional harmonic
oscillator in Cartesian coordinates with ten major shells
which are found to be suﬃcient for the hypernuclei un-
der consideration. The mass of the Λ hyperon is taken
as mΛ = 1115.6 MeV/c2. Pairing correlation between
the nucleons is treated with the BCS approximation by
using a density-independent δ force with a smooth cut
oﬀ factor [45].

In the projection calculation, the Gauss-Legendre
quadrature is used for the integral over Euler angle θ.
The number of mesh points in the interval [0, π] for the
Euler angle θ and gauge angle ϕτ is chosen as 14 and 9
in the angular momentum and particle number projec-
tion, respectively. The Pfaﬃan method [46] is applied to
evaluate the phase of the norm overlap in the kernels.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Mean-ﬁeld calculation

1. Hyperon impurity eﬀect

Figure 1 displays the total energies of 36Ar and 37

ΛsAr,
37
Λp Ar, and 37
Λd Ar as a function of the quadrupole defor-
mation parameter β with the PC-F1 (N N ) + PCY-S1
(N Λ) parameter set. The hyperon is put in the lowest
one of the states which correspond to the s, p, or d state
in the spherical limit, respectively. The density proﬁles
for some selected deformed conﬁgurations are also plot-
ted in Fig. 1. The mean-ﬁeld energy curves are similar
to those in the RMF-ME model [36].

One can see a global minimum of the binding energy
of 36Ar located at the oblate shape with β ≃ −0.20 and
a shallow SD minimum at β ≃ 0.64 with the excitation
energy Ex = 9.8 MeV. Considering the triaxial γ defor-
mation, the shallow minima or shoulders around β ∼ 0.1
and β ∼ 1.2 turn out to be actually two saddle points of
the energy surface in β-γ plane. With the addition of one
hyperon in s, p, or d state, respectively, the topography
of the energy curve does not change dramatically. The
global oblate minimum and the SD minimum persist in
37
Λ Ar. Quantitatively, the deformation of the global min-
imum is slightly decreased to −0.18 in 37
ΛsAr, while that
of the SD minimum becomes 0.60. In contrast, the defor-
mation parameter of global minimum and SD minimum
is increased to β = −0.22 and β = 0.66, respectively,
in 37
Λd Ar, these values are β = −0.22 and
β = 0.68, respectively. The shape-driving eﬀects of the
Λs, Λp, and Λd in 37
Λ Ar are consistent with the ﬁndings
for other sd-shell nuclei demonstrated in our previous in-
vestigation [12].

results, we perform the calculation with the other three
eﬀective N Λ interactions PCY-S2, PCY-S3, and PCY-
S4, respectively. The potential energy curves (PECs) of
37
Λs Ar, 37
Λd Ar are exhibited in Fig. 2. Similar to-
pographies of the PECs are shown for the four N Λ sets,
respectively, when the Λ is put in the same orbital. The
SD states persist in 37
Λ Ar for all four eﬀective interac-
tions. A small diﬀerence amongst the predictions of the
four interactions is shown in the region around spherical
shape. The detailed information of the predicted ND and
SD states in 37
Λ Ar is listed in Table I. All the four interac-
tions predict rather similar deformations for the ND and
SD conﬁgurations. Besides, we note that for all the N Λ
interactions except for the PCY-S2 interaction, the pre-
dicted excitation energy of the SD state in 37
Λ Ar is lower
than that in 36Ar. In particular, the excitation energy
decreases from 9.2 MeV to 5.8 MeV in the hypernucleus
from 37
ΛdAr for the PCY-S1 . The shrinkage eﬀect
of Λs on nuclear size is also shown in Table I. However,
the Λp and Λd may either increase or decrease the rms
radii of neurons and protons, depending on the details
of the eﬀective N Λ interaction. In particular, the PCY-
S2 predicts the rms radii of neutrons (Rn), protons (Rp)
and the hyperon (RΛ) are much smaller than the other
three N Λ interactions. One may understand it as a con-
sequence of the missing N Λ tensor coupling term in the
PCY-S2. Of particular interest is that the proton skin
∆Rpn ≡ Rp − Rn is not changed at all by one Λ, as a
consequence of the isoscalar nature of a Λ hyperon.

2. Correlation between Λ separation energy and density
overlap

The contribution to Λ separation (or binding) energy
can be divided into kinetic energy and interaction energy
between the Λ and the core nuclei. The contribution
from the kinetic energy to the diﬀerence in the Λ binding
energies of the ND and SD states, deﬁned as ∆EN S
Λ =
Λ − SSD
SND
Λ , can be roughly neglected. Therefore, several
authors [34–36] tried to understand the ∆EN S
from the
interaction energy which is approximately proportional
to the overlap Ioverlap between the densities of the core
nuclei and Λ hyperon, c.f. Eq. (5),

Λ

Ioverlap =

Z

d3rρΛ(r)ρN (r).

(17)

This quantity has previously been adopted to study
the triaxial deformation γ eﬀect on the Λ binding energy
with SHF+BCS method in Ref. [9].

Figure 3(a) displays the correlation between the Λ sep-
aration energy SΛ and the density overlap Ioverlap with
diﬀerent interactions in diﬀerent models for the ND and
SD states of 37
ΛsAr. One can see that a larger Ioverlap value
corresponds to a larger SΛ. Our results show that the
SΛ in SD states is larger than that in ND states, which
is consistent with the prediction by the RMF-ME [36],
but contradicts to the results from the HyperAMD [34]

and SHF [35] models. The correlations between SΛ and
Ioverlap, calculated by the four N Λ interactions for the
ND and SD states of 37
ΛdAr, are shown
in the Fig. 3(b), (c), and (d), respectively. One observes
that the SΛ and Ioverlap in SD states are always larger
than these in ND states in all cases except for the PCY-
S2 interaction in 37

ΛpAr, and 37

ΛsAr, 37

ΛsAr.

Table II lists the deformation parameters, rms radii,
total energy, Λ separation energy, and the Ioverlap for
both the ND and SD states in 36Ar and 37
ΛsAr, in com-
parison with the results of other models. The results of
all the models are rather similar. However, if one ana-
lyzed the results in a quantitative way, one can see the
following points.

• The change of the deformation for both the ND
and SD states induced by the Λ in the relativistic
models is signiﬁcantly larger than that in the non-
relativistic models. This point has already been
discussed in Refs. [12, 47].

• The SHF model predicted the smallest deforma-
tion, Λ separation energy and Ioverlap for both the
ND and SD hypernuclear states. For the latter two,
it may have something to do with the fact that the
mean-ﬁeld potentials in the SHF model are shal-
lower than those of the RMF models [35].

• The Λs separation energy in the SD state is pre-
dicted to be larger than that in the ND state in
the relativistic models. However, an controversial
results was pointed out in non-relativistic models.
We note that the overlap Ioverlap between the Λ
hyperon and core nuclei is correlated to the Λ sep-
aration energy. This correlation is further investi-
gated with diﬀerent sets of N Λ interaction for 37
ΛsAr,
ΛpAr and 37
37
ΛdAr, respectively, as illustrated in Ta-
ble III. In particular, one ﬁnds from Table III that
the Λ separation energy of the SD state becomes
increasingly larger than that of the ND state as
the valence Λ is put from s orbit to d orbit. Simi-
lar conclusions are drawn for 49
Λ S, except
that the Λs separation energy of the SD states is
signiﬁcantly lower than that in the ND states, as
demonstrated in Table IV.

Λ Ar and 33

To shed some light on the relation between the local-
ization of nuclear density and Λ separation energy as sug-
gested in Ref. [36], we plot the density distributions of
baryons for both the ND and SD states of 36Ar and 37
ΛsAr
hypernuclei with the four N Λ interactions, respectively,
as shown in Fig. 4. One can see that the ring-shaped
clustering structure in the SD state for all the N Λ inter-
actions is much less pronounced than that predicted in
the RMF-ME model [36]. Instead, the result is closer to

that found in the HyperAMD [34] and SHF [35] models.
The distributions of baryons in 37
Λd Ar for the
PCY-S1 and PCY-S2 interactions are plotted in Fig. 5
and Fig. 6, respectively. Again, the ring-shape nuclear
clustering structure is not clearly exhibited. This ﬁnding
indicates that the predicted larger Λ separation energy of
SD state is not necessary attributed to the ring-shaped
clustering structure of nucleons in hypernuclei. Instead,
the distribution of the hyperon which depends on the de-
tails of the N Λ interaction may play a more important
role, as indicated by the behavior of the ∆EN S
for dif-
ferent orbital Λ, c.f. Table III and Table IV.

Λ

In short, we ﬁnd that the Λp and Λd binding energies
of SD state are always larger than those of the ND state.
However, for the Λs, the conclusion depends on the de-
tails of the eﬀective nucleon-hyperon interaction and the
core nuclei. We note that these conclusions are drawn
based on the mean-ﬁeld model. The beyond-mean-ﬁeld
eﬀect may play an important role. It will be discussed in

the next subsection.

B. Beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀect

The beyond-mean-ﬁeld studies of the ND and SD
states in 36Ar have been performed by several groups [26–
28]. Therefore, here we discuss very brieﬂy our results for
36Ar, with an emphasis on the diﬀerence among the re-
sults of diﬀerent models. Before spelling out our results,
we note that our results for 36Ar might be somewhat
diﬀerent from those in Ref. [28] because of the diﬀerent
numerical details, such as the way to generate mean-ﬁeld
reference states and the treatment of particle number
projection.

Figure 7 displays the comparison of the energy curves
for both mean-ﬁeld and quantum-number projected
states with J = 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
It shows that the
energy gained from symmetry restoration changes signif-
icantly the topography of the energy curve. The energy
curve of J = 0 becomes rather ﬂat around the spherical
shape in the region −0.3 6 β 6 0.3. Moreover, the defor-
mation of the SD state is shifted to β = 0.70, compared
to the mean-ﬁeld value β = 0.64. The discrete states

eraged quadrupole deformation ¯β =

Figure 8 shows the energy diﬀerence ∆E(J) = E(J) −
E(J − 2) and B(E2) value as a function of angular mo-
mentum of the SD band in 36Ar. The excitation en-
ergy of the bandhead of the SD band is predicted to be
around 8.0 MeV, compared with the value 5.9 MeV by
the PNAMP+GCM based on the Skyrme SLy6 interac-
tion [26], 7.5 MeV by the AMP+GCM with Gogny D1S
interaction [27], 9.2 MeV by the PNAMP+GCM with
the re-adjusted PC-F1∗ interaction [28], and 9.4 MeV
by the AMP+GCM with the PC-F1 interaction [28], re-
spectively. However, the experimental value 4.3 MeV [20]
is much smaller than all the predictions. The consider-
ation of triaxiality and the eﬀect of time-reversal sym-

increasingly overestimated with angular momentum. It

crurrent work.

The beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀect on hypernuclear states
is investigated by taking the PC-F1 (N N ) and PCY-S2
(N Λ) interactions and putting the Λ in the lowest energy
state. Fig. 9 displays the same quantities as those in
Fig. 7 but for the beyond-mean-ﬁeld calculation of 37
Λs Ar
based on the PC-F1 (N N ) + PCY-S2 (N Λ) interaction.
We ﬁnd that the deformation of the ND minimum of the
energy curve J = 1/2 of 37
ΛsAr is β = −0.20, smaller than
that (β = −0.25) of J = 0 energy curve in Fig. 7. The
deformation of the SD minimum is shifted from β = 0.70

(for 36Ar) to β = 0.64 (for 37
ΛsAr). After performing the
conﬁguration mixing calculation, we obtain the discrete
hypernuclear states J + (J = Jc ± 1/2) which are almost
two-fold degenerate with the excitation energies close to
those of the core states J +
c . The similar phenomenon has
also been found in 21
Λ Ne [15]. The SΛ for the ND 1/2+
state is 19.21 MeV and SΛ = 19.06 MeV for the SD 1/2+
state. These values should be compared to the mean-ﬁeld
results of 19.28 MeV and 19.23 MeV, respectively.
In
other words, the beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀect decreases the
Λs binding energy of the SD state by 0.17 MeV, while it

states in both 36Ar and 37
Λs Ar are plotted in Fig. 10 and
Fig. 11, respectively. It is shown that the wavefunctions
for the two-fold degenerate states with J = Jc ± 1/2 are
almost on top of each other. Compared with those of
36Ar, the collective wavefunctions of hypernuclear states
in 37
Λs Ar are slightly shifted inward to spherical shape. It
is consistent with previous studies [8–15] about the impu-

rity eﬀect of Λs which reduces the quadrupole collectivity
of atomic nuclei.

Figure 12 displays the energy spectra of 36Ar and 37
ΛsAr,
in comparison with available data of 36Ar. We note
that the energies and E2 transition strengths for the ND
states are reproduced rather well. Again the SD states
are systematically overestimated. Compared to 36Ar, the
E2 transition strength between the ND 3/2+, 1/2+ states
in 37
ΛsAr is 48.9 e2 fm4, smaller than the B(E2; 2+ → 0+)
in 36Ar by 14.5%, while the E2 transition strength be-
tween the SD 3/2+, 1/2+ states is reduced by 10.7%.
Moreover, the excitation energy of the ND and SD 3/2+
states in 37
ΛsAr is found by 7.7% and 2.2% larger than
those of the 2+
1 state in 36Ar, respectively. It hints that
the Λs hyperon impurity eﬀect on the energy spectra is
more pronounced for the ND state than for the SD state
in 37

ΛsAr.

the coexistence of ND and SD shapes in the case of the
Λ is put in the lowest one of the states which corre-
spond to the s, p, or d state in the spherical limit, re-
spectively. In the mean-ﬁeld calculation, four sets of rel-
ativistic point-coupling N Λ interactions PCY-S1, PCY-
S2, PCY-S3, and PCY-S4 have been adopted to exam-
ine the parameter-dependence of the results. To scruti-
nize the beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀect, we have carried out a
quantum number (particle number and angular momen-
tum) projected generator coordinate method calculation
for 37

ΛsAr.
Our results indicate that after taking the hyperon im-
purity eﬀect into account, the SD states persist in 37
Λ Ar
for all the four N Λ eﬀective interactions and the Λs
decreases the quadrupole collectivity of ND states to a
greater extent than that of SD states. Moreover, the
beyond-mean-ﬁeld eﬀect decreases the Λs binding energy
in the SD state by 0.17 MeV, while its eﬀect on that of
the ND state is negligible. The predicted larger Λs sepa-
ration energy in the SD state by relativistic models is not
necessary attributed to the ring-shaped clustering struc-
ture of nucleons in hypernuclei. The distribution of the
hyperon, which depends on the details of the N Λ inter-
action, may play a more important role. The Λp and
Λd binding energies of SD states are always larger than
those in the ND states. Finally, we point out that the SD
states of hypernuclei might be diﬃcult to be produced in
current experimental facilities, the conclusions derived
from this study are helpful to understand the hyperon
impurity eﬀect on nuclear matter and atomic nuclei in a
comprehensive way.
