Abstract
We have analyzed multi-wavelength observations and magnetic-ﬁeld data for the solar ﬂare
of May 10, 2012 (04:18 UT) and have detected a sign inversion of the signal in the line-of-
sight magnetic measurements in the umbra of a small spot. This effect is associated, at least
partly, with the emergence of a new magnetic ﬁeld. Almost at the same time, a burst of hard
X-rays was recorded, and a “sunquake” was generated due to the impact of the disturbance
in the energy release range on the photosphere. At the beginning of the event, a sigmoid ﬂare
was recorded, but it did not spread, as it usually does, along the polarity inversion (neutral)
line. SDO/HMI full-vector measurements were used to extrapolate the AR 11476 magnetic
ﬁeld to the corona, and the distribution of vertical currents jz in the photosphere was obtained.
The distribution of currents in the active region shows that the relationship between them and
the occurrence of ﬂares is very intricate. We have corroborated that the expected “ideal”
behavior of the current system before and after the ﬂare (e.g., see (Sharykin and Kosovichev,
2015)) is observed only in the sigmoid region. The results obtained were compared with the
observations of two other ﬂares recorded in this AR on the same day, one of which was similar
to the ﬂare under discussion and the other was of different type. Our results conﬁrm that the
formation and eruption of large-scale magnetic ﬂux ropes in sigmoid ﬂares are associated
with the shear motions in the photosphere and the emergence of twisted magnetic tubes, as
well as with the subsequent development of the torus instability.

1. Introduction

Over the past 15 years of the new century, TRACE, RHESSI, CORONAS-F, and other spacecrafts have
provided a wealth of data on nonstationary processes in the Sun. The characteristics of X-ray sources
and the relationship with the microwave and optical emission of solar ﬂares have been studied in detail
In the past 50 years it was believed that these events occurred in the corona
(Krucker et al., 2008).
and were due to reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. However, the recent Hinode, SDO/HMI, and
AIA full-vector magnetic observations (Schou, et al., 2012; Lemen, et al., 2012) and the theoretical
extrapolation of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds to the corona (Metcalf, et al., 2008) have shown that, in the
course of evolution of active regions, the magnetic-ﬁeld energy is accumulated at very low altitudes in the
chromospheres, where the Lorentz forces operate, and electric currents are ampliﬁed signiﬁcantly. The
free energy of the currents is released at low altitudes giving rise to ﬂares, coronal mass ejections (CME),
and “sunquakes”. This makes us turn from the recently introduced term “coronal ﬂare” back to the notion
of chromospheric ﬂares, which was widespread in the 1960-1970-ies. This opinion is supported even by
the advocates of the reconnection theory as a mechanism of ﬂares (Fletcher et al., 2011).

At the early stage of measurements of solar magnetic ﬁelds, A.B.Severny (1988) showed that the
sources of individual ﬂare nodes in the chromosphere are located in the vicinity of the polarity inversion
line. He and his co-authors showed also that these nodes arise in the areas of a high-magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient. The ﬁrst full-vector measurements of AR magnetic ﬁelds allowed them to study the relationship
between the electric currents and the process of evolution of solar ﬂares. However, the correlation be-
tween the distribution of the vertical magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬂare nodes in the chromospheric H-alpha
line proved to be very complicated. Only now the problem discussed by A.B.Severny and D.Rust (Rust,
1968) can be investigated more or less comprehensively using modern observations of the magnetic-ﬁeld
dynamics, multi-wavelength observations of ﬂares, and new theoretical concepts of electromagnetic pro-
cesses in the Sun.

Recent studies of the relation between the evolution of magnetic ﬁelds and the nonstationary pro-
cesses are based on several earlier results. An important ﬁnding was the emergence of new magnetic
ﬁelds. The change in the ﬁeld conﬁguration can result in a sudden release of energy or can intensify the
emission of impulsive ﬂares along with the generation of plasma motions (CME etc.) and EUV waves
(sunquakes). The heating of plasma in the chromosphere may be due to the dissipation of currents (Zait-
sev and Stepanov, 2008), to the Lorenz forces (Fisher, et al., 2012), or to the energy loss of accelerated
particles at the beginning of the gas-dynamic response considered ﬁrst by Kostyuk and Pikelner (1975).
To understand the origin of nonstationary processes, it is necessary to note that in some cases before or
during the ﬂare a large-scale ﬂux rope emerges usually in the vicinity of the polarity inversion line lead-

ing to the occurrence of a sigmoid ﬂare (see (Hood et al., 2012, and references therein) and to subsequent
formation of post-eruption arcades.

Thus, the appearance of new theoretical and observational data required new concepts of the develop-
ment of MHD processes in the outer atmosphere of the Sun. These concepts should take into account the
direct effect of currents on the heating and motion of plasmas in the chromosphere and its behavior in the
force-free and potential ﬁelds in the corona, including the possibility of reconnection of the ﬁeld lines
and formation of thin current sheets. Of primary importance in approaching this problem as a whole is
the simulation of the AR current system. In doing so, we must take into account the topology of magnetic
ﬁelds in the AR or in the complexes of activity, which was studied ﬁrst by Lee et al. (2010). A sudden
reconstruction of the magnetic conﬁguration proves to be closely related to the development of nonsta-
tionary phenomena. The role of shear motions in such reconstruction was considered earlier (Matyukhin
and Tomozov, 1991, see following discussion in Prist and Forbes, 2000) usually for the processes with
reconnection in the corona. According to the numerical model by Hood et al. (2012), the emergence of
twisted ﬂux ropes is indicative of such reconstruction of the magnetic conﬁguration and current system.
Of course, it is important to ﬁnd observational evidence that would support or disprove the new
theoretical conjectures. Perhaps one of the ﬁrst publications in this context was the work by Sharykin
and Kosovichev (2015), where Figure 10 represents schematically a current system with vertical currents
jz of opposite signs on either side of the polarity inversion line. Indeed, such a picture would be expected
in the simplest case of transition from the twisted ﬂux rope to the ﬂare post-eruption phase. Now, however,
there are numerous full-vector measurements in many active regions where the distribution of the vertical
current jz is restored. As in the pioneering work by Severny, this distribution throughout the AR does not
correspond to the ideal pattern.

In this work we made an attempt to investigate the relationship between the currents and the devel-
opment of non-stationary processes on the example of the events on 2012 May 10. The ﬁrst ﬂare with
the maximum at 04:18 UT (GOES) was unusual since the emergence of the new ﬁeld in it was observed
in the umbra of the small spot with the simultaneous hard X-ray burst. This event was accompanied
by a sunquake. The second ﬂare with the maximum at 05:10 UT was more typical, and the third ﬂare
(20:26 UT) was like the ﬁrst one, but less powerful. After the Introduction, in Section 2 we analyse the
emission of the ﬁrst ﬂare. In Section 3 the analysis of the observations of the magnetic ﬁeld emergence at
04:00 UT is given, in Section 4 the behavior of the photospheric and coronal magnetic ﬁelds is discussed,
and in Section 5 the data are brieﬂy compared with that on the two subsequent ﬂares. In the last section
we discuss the question of the origin and the possible model of sigmoid ﬂares with the ejection of large
twisted magnetic ropes.

2. Electromagnetic Emission in the Flare of May 10, 2012 (04:18 UT)

AR 11476 appeared on the disk on May 5, 2012, and by May 10, its area reached 1000 m.v.h. The
corresponding sunspot group consisted of a large, complex leading spot and minor spots at the center
and in the tail part of the group. On the day under discussion, the AR produced two large M-ﬂares and a
series of weak ﬂares of class C. Here, we consider the ﬁrst ﬂare M5.7 (04:11–4:23, maximum at 4:18 UT,
GOES) and then compare it with the T7.9 ﬂares that occurred at the decay of the ﬁrst one and with the
M1.7 ﬂare observed in the same AR in the evening of that day (see Fig. 1).

The ﬁrst ﬂare was ordinary as to its X-ray and microwave emission. It occurred in close proximity
to a small spot at the center of the group near the polarity inversion line, had impulsive nature, and was
rather hard.

The left-hand part of Fig. 2 represents the entire AR 11476 in the white light (SDO/HMI Ic). The

The same ﬂare in the 131 ˚A line (SDO/AIA) at the growth of its intensity is also shown on the right.

In general, judging by its X-ray emission recorded by GOES and RHESSI (Lin, et al., 2002), this was
a typical event somewhat harder than an average ﬂare of importance M5 as seen from Fig. 1 (the tilt of
the photon spectrum g ≈ 3.0 in the energy range of 20–80 keV, Fig. 1).

The microwave ﬂux was also characteristic of the ﬂares of this class with a complex behavior of the
polarized component (Stokes parameter V). The time proﬁles of intensity (Stokes parameter I) and polar-
ization (Stokes parameter V) at the frequencies of 17.0, 9.4, 3.75 and 2.0 GHz based on the Nobeyama
polarimeter data (NoRP: Shibasaki et al., 1979; Nakajima et al., 1985) are given on the left and at the
center of Fig. 3. The values and the dynamics of ﬂuxes correspond to the majority of ﬂares of this inten-
sity. As usual, there are two discernible footpoints of the ﬂare loop, located in the magnetic ﬁelds of the
opposite signs (Fig. 3, right).

On the other hand, the polarization demonstrates a rather complicated time behavior. In particular, In
particular, we have to be an inversion of the polarized emission sign at the frequency of 9.4 GHz. Besides,
a sudden change of sign is observed at 2 GHz at 04:16 UT. Such a picture of evolution of the polarized
microwave emission may be associated with a complex AR topology in the lower corona.

3. Emergence of Magnetic Fields

It is well known that in many cases, a relationship can be observed between the occurrence of a ﬂare and
the emergence of a new magnetic ﬁeld. However these two processes do not usually coincide in time
and space. In other words, the emergence of a new magnetic ﬁeld violates the stability of the magnetic
conﬁguration. The ﬂare in a given AR may occur far enough from the emerging ﬁeld, before or after
the emergence or, even between its separate episodes. In the case under consideration, the two processes
coincided in space and time. Besides that, though usually the new magnetic ﬁeld appears in the vicinity
of the polarity inversion line separating the ﬁelds of medium-high intensity, in our case, the emergence
occurred in the umbra of a small spot at the AR center (square B in Fig. 2). Here, the change of sign of
the signal (SDO/HMI LOS) is indicative of the ﬁeld emergence, but still it certainly does not mean the
inversion of the ﬁeld sign.

We have analyzed the Stokes parameters recorded in the supposed emergence area and obtained the
Gaussian distribution. Of course, strong plasma streams may also interfere with the ﬁeld measurements.
One of the arguments for the reality of the ﬁeld emergence is the fact that a similar picture was observed
during the ﬂare recorded at the same site in the same AR later in the evening at 20:26 UT.

The evolution of the emerging ﬁeld in region B at some selected points of time based on the
SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms is illustrated in Fig. 4. The reversed sign of the signal was observed dur-
ing 4 min., after which the signal was restored to its former value during another 4 min. Unfortunately,
full-vector magnetic data are only available for the moments before and after the emergence. Note that
the upward directed motions are registered according to the data of SDO/HMI in the frame 04:16:30 UT.
During the event under discussion, a sunquake was recorded in the vicinity of the hard X-ray maxi-
mum (Buitrago-Cass, et al., 2015). Such a response to the sudden energy release in the photosphere is
projected onto the point at the peak of a low ﬂare loop. The asterisk (X) in the right-hand part of Fig. 3
marks the position of the hard X-ray source at the maximum of the burst. The isolines of radio brightness
at 17.0 and 34.0 GHz superimposed on the line-of-sight distribution of magnetic ﬁelds at the maximum
of the event are given according to the Nobeyama radio heliograph data (NoRH: Nakajima et al., 1994).
The footpoints of the low ﬂare loop seen in different SDO/AIA ranges are best pronounced at the high
frequency of 34.0 GHZ. In this case, the sunquake is most likely bound to the time and site of the primary
energy release. This suggestion agrees with the sunquake data available in (Sharykin and Kosovichev,
2015; Sharykin, Kosovichev, and Zimovets, 2015)

4. Extrapolation of Fields to the Corona and Distribution of Electric
Currents in AR 11476

In recent years, our understanding of the role of magnetic ﬁelds in the development of activity in the outer
atmosphere of the Sun has changed. It was found that the magnetic beta (the ratio of the gas pressure to
the magnetic pressure), which is close to unity immediately above the photosphere, becomes very small
in the chromosphere and corona. As a result, the plasma at the base of the active region is exposed to the
Lorenz forces, while higher the ﬁeld becomes force-free. At the same time, the evolution of ﬁelds in the
chromosphere can lead to a signiﬁcant excess of the magnetic-ﬁeld energy over the corresponding value
of the force-free (potential) ﬁeld, and this free energy can be spent on the development of nonstationary
processes.

Full-vector magnetic observations in the photosphere allow us to extrapolate the nonlinear force-free
ﬁelds up to the corona. This method called NLFFF (nonlinear force-free ﬁeld) extrapolation is widely
used in heliophysics (e.g., see (Metcalf et al, 2008)).

scales provide the distance from the center of the disk in arcsec.

In our work, for the calculation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld in the non-linear force-free approxima-
tion an optimisation method (ﬁrst proposed in (Wheatland et al, 2000)) is employed in the implementation
of (Rudenko and Myshyakov, 2009). The core of the method is the subsequent transformation of some
initial (potential) distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld toward the force-free structure in accordance with the
photospheric magnetogram. To do this a functional of the following type is introduced:

We have performed calculations based on the solution of the boundary-(Rudenko and Myshyakov,
2009) value problem for the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld using minimization of the functional introduced
in:

L =

ZV

[B−2|[(cid:209) × B] × B|2 + |(cid:209)

· B|2 ]dV,

(1)

which equals 0 if the ﬁeld B is force-free and is positive in the opposite case.

Thus, in the course of the solution of the functional (1) minimisation problem, the ﬁeld in the volume
V acquires the force-free conﬁguration. As the initial distribution we use a potential ﬁeld calculated from
the normal component of the photospheric ﬁeld via fast Fourier transform (FFT). A remarkable feature
of the optimisation method’s realisation, which we apply, is the use of the full system of the evolution
equations of the ﬁeld (see (Rudenko and Myshyakov, 2009)).

The ﬁeld lines in region A shown in Fig. 2 were calculated up to the height of 25 000 km. The
result is represented in Fig. 5. One can see that at the very beginning of the ﬂare, the force lines around
the ﬁeld hill in a small spot are clustering along the polarity inversion line, and the ﬂare nodes are
formed in the region of their highest concentration (see the EUV background on the negative image in
Fig. 5). Generally speaking, a bunch of force lines covering a signiﬁcant part of the polarity inversion
line, particularly, where it separates the hills of strong magnetic ﬁelds, can form in many ﬂares. In our
case, it can be supposed that a small bunch was formed only on the south side of a small spot at the center
of the group. As in other sigmoid ﬂares, such a shape of the ﬁeld lines in AR stimulates the development
of sigmoid ﬂare. In this case, the ﬁeld reconstruction occurred almost immediately after the formation of
currents over the neutral line.

Figure 5 shows only closed ﬁeld lines in the selected region A in projection on the plane of the sky.
We can see a small spot of negative polarity fringed with a bunch of ﬁeld lines that continue further
beyond the neutral line. At present it is believed that this is where the main force-free currents usually
identiﬁed with the plasma ﬂux rope are ﬂowing. It is important to note that this bunch of ﬁeld lines
coincides with the position of the ﬂare nodes forming a small sigmoid.

As shown by NLFFF-extrapolation, there are also ﬁeld lines rising up to 5000 km and higher and
connecting the small spot of negative polarity with the hill of the ﬁeld of opposite sign. They are located
above the bunch of ﬁeld lines and perhaps prevent the ejection. In the course of the ﬂare evolution as
inferred from SDO/AIA EUV data, the ﬂare loops 10-20 thousand km high were formed, but plasma did
not escape into interplanetary space (i.e., a CME did not occur as it follows from the radio data: there is
no a type II burst etc.).

Then at the photosphere level we have calculated the distribution of vertical currents jz throughout
the AR on May 10, 2012 for the time interval from 03:48 UT to 05:48 UT using the full-vector magnetic
data with a step of 720 s. The analysis of the location of ﬂares on that day corroborates the correlation
between the sites of occurrence of the ﬂare nodes and the areas of enhanced current (Grigor’eva et al.,
2013). However, no deﬁnite regularity was revealed in the behavior of the currents throughout the AR
and in the occurrence of ﬂares. Namely, all currents are concentrated along the neutral line, including
the area near spots. Therefore, the changes that may occur in the middle of the neutral line in AR are not
identiﬁed in the total current of one and the other sign. Sharykin and Kosovichev (2015) drew attention

line-of-sight components of the magnetic ﬁeld of positive (white) and negative (black) sign in the
ﬂare region at 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of the maximum at the same time. The white line

ﬁeld of the opposite signs. The direct blue lines show the projection cube with the height of
25 000 km. The scales provide the distance from the center of the disk in arcsec.

to the fact that in an “ideal” current system, the mean currents of each sign must increase on either side
of the polarity inversion line. In our case, like in the studies of the 1970-ies considering the relationship
between the vertical currents and ﬂares, this effect is very weak in respect to the entire AR.

Since in the growth phase of the ﬂare the largest changes in the magnetic ﬁeld are recorded at the site
of occurrence of the sigmoid, we have studied this effect in the selected region A (see Fig. 1). Figure 6
illustrates the distribution of the vertical currents in the photosphere for two points of time. One can see
that the currents of different sign contact at the point Y 256, X − 350 arcsec. This area coincides with
the region of the ﬁeld lines concentration in Fig. 5 above the point on the polarity inversion line in the
region of strong ﬁelds (see Fig. 4).

Generally, the evolution of the currents pattern is traced upon the set of the jz maps constructed on
the basis of the data on the full vector of the ﬁeld. The largest change of the currents takes place in the
pointed region of the sigmoid localization. The subsequent evolution of the current system appears to be
tightly bound with the development of numerous weak ﬂares in AR 11476. Note also that the substantial
change of the currents took place at 04:00–04:24 UT in the area Y 250, X − 364 arcsec which is the
footpoint of the loop connecting the place of the magnetic ﬁeld emergence with the hill of the positive
polarity (see Fig. 5).

Except the change of the currents pattern, the difference between two images on left part of Fig. 6 is
manifested in all the current values, the fact which in this example is revealed even in the difference of
the scales.

To study this effect, we have determined the mean value of the vertical current in the whole region
(A). The averaging was done separately for the pixels with the positive and negative ﬁelds. In the time
interval from 04:00 UT to 05:48 UT in Fig. 6 one can observe the general trend of the averaged vertical
current jz of both signs. The whole trend represents the fact that the ﬂaring activity of this AR on that
day was gradually increasing.

The effect related to the ﬂare in question is manifested as the increase of the averaged currents dur-
ing the ﬂare 04:00 UT–04:24 UT. According to the hard X-ray data, the maximum of the ﬂare falls on
04:16:30 UT (see Fig. 1). In our case the maximum value corresponds to the time 04:24 UT and falls
down afterwards. Such character of the change of jz is noticed in (Sharykin and Kosovichev, 2015) as
well. The maximum value is small and only slightly exceeds the value of 3 s
(its s value of approxi-
mately 2.3 · 10−4 A/m2 is determined from the change of the currents in the area of the same active region
in the quiescent state).

Note also that the ﬂare maximum pointed out occured between 04:12 UT and 04:24 UT. Unfortu-
nately, there is no freely accessed data on the full magnetic ﬁeld vector with better time resolution,
therefore our effect of the change of the currents’ characteristics during this ﬂare can be somewhat under-
estimated.

5. The Other Flares of May 10, 2012

AR 11476, which we are discussing, displayed a high ﬂare activity. Every day since May 6 it produced a
large number of weak C-ﬂares and, on some days until May 17, 1 or 2 M-ﬂares.

In addition to the ﬂare of importance M5.7 we are considering here, it produced on the same day
16 C-ﬂares and one ﬂare of importance M1.7 recorded at 20:20 UT. A change in the signal intensity
was recorded in the umbra of the same spot as in the ﬁrst M-ﬂare according to the line-of-sight ﬁeld
distribution (SDO/HMI LOS). The duration of this effect was two times less than in the ﬁrst ﬂare (from
20:24 UT to 20:29 UT). However here, unlike the M5.7 ﬂare, the signal on the HMI LOS magnetogram
in the emergence region did not change the sign.

This M1.7 ﬂare was also rather hard. The FERMI space mission recorded the emission in
the range of about 100 keV. At the same time (about 20:24 UT), signiﬁcant radiation ﬂuxes in
the energy range above 50 keV with a maximum of more than 2000 pulses per second were
recorded by the Suzaku spacecraft (see the catalogue Suzaku Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM):
http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/HXD-WAM/WAM-GRB/solar/untrig/120510202227.html ). Thus, the conditions
that lead to the events of the type of a “fast” sigmoid can arise in AR with a period from several hours to
a day.

Most of the ﬂares of class C on the day under discussion had a different origin than the M-ﬂares. Let
us consider by way of example the ﬂare T7.9, which was observed at the decay of the soft X-ray emission
from our principal event. The ﬂare occurred at 05:04 UT over the polarity inversion line between the spots
we are considering and the leading spots. Then, the ﬂare nodes extended from this point directly to the
large spot. Such weak events might be triggered by the activity in the latter. In some cases, this activity
is due to the emergence of a new ﬁeld in the vicinity of the spot or with its rotation, or simply with the
formation of new magnetic hills. Some of the weak events are rather hard, but they occur usually at the
decay of the soft X-ray emission from major ﬂares. Their hardness is due to the conditions favorable for
particle acceleration in the traps where a certain number of electrons with energies above 10 keV still
remain after the previous event (Vybornov et al., 2015).

6. Results and Discussion

Our conclusions are as follows:

1) In the event under examination, there actually occurred a pulse-like energy release accompanied
by the bursts of hard X-ray and microwave emission. Simultaneously, a response of the photosphere was
recorded in the form of an sunquake. There is every reason to believe that at the same time, the formation
of a sigmoid ﬂare began, but it was not completed. Similar processes were repeated in the second M-ﬂare
at 20:20 UT, but were absent in many weak ﬂares of class C in the other parts of this AR.

2) Full-vector magnetic data were used to calculate the vertical currents throughout the AR. A simple
pattern of the current system that consists of the loop currents above the neutral line (with allowance for
the shear) and the currents closed under the photosphere does not agree with the results of calculations for
ﬁrst ﬂare. However, if such calculations are carried out in an area conﬁned to the size of the ﬂare sigmoid,
we will ﬁnd local maxima in the time variation of both positive and negative vertical currents. For the
longer time interval, the time variations of averaged vertical currents determines the overall evolution of
the ﬂare activity in a given AR.

3) This example of moderate power event has demonstrated at both the sunquake and particle ac-
celeration are more effective in sufﬁciently strong magnetic ﬁelds residing near the polarity inversion
line.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the connection of our results to the gentral problem of the development of
non-stationary processes. The phenomenon of sigmoid ﬂares has been widely discussed in literature. A
rich experience of numerical simulation of these processes has been accumulated (e.g., see (Hood et al.,
2012, and references therein). Formerly, many authors adhered to the idea of reconnection of magnetic-
ﬁeld lines. Now, it is believed that the main factor is the dynamics of the currents, while the role of
the reconnection becomes signiﬁcant at high altitudes in the corona. The earlier conclusion that plasma
ﬂux ropes with the current are not ejected directly from the top of the convection zone remains valid.
Large-scale sub-photospheric motions shear the feet of the ﬁeld lines along the polarity inversion line. In
addition to that, the helicity is also carried out from sub-photospheric layers.

So, the emergence of the shear and helicity creates conditions for the formation of a magnetic ﬂux

rope. Both theoretical reasoning and extrapolation of the nonlinear force-free ﬁelds to the corona suggest
that the evolution of the AR magnetic ﬁeld described above must result in accumulation of some amount
of free energy in the chromosphere, which can be spent on the development of nonstationary processes.
The very moment of a large impulsive ﬂare is associated with the reconstruction of the current system
in AR. Namely, the bunch of force lines and the currents along them change essentially approaching the
ideal conﬁguration, i.e., currents along the loops, which are located in projection onto the photosphere at
a large angle to the neutral line.

After the ﬂux rope is released, the magnetic conﬁguration restores its original state. If the previ-
ously existing large-scale sub-photospheric motions continue, the formation of the ﬂux rope is repeated,
i.e., a series of similar ﬂares occur. These considerations agree with the results of the latest numerical
calculations (Savcheva, 2016).

One important issue is to ﬁgure out a mechanism of the ﬂare. We note that prior a ﬂare the strong
current in the magnetic rope has to be closed under the photosphere. This suggests the toroid in the
meridian plane, partially risen above the photosphere. This geometry of the twisted magnetic ﬁekd is
given in Figure 2 in Titov and D´emoulin (1999).

In fact, the ﬂux ropes can exist for a long time even in active regions of rather complex topology.
However, in some cases, especially at geat currents, a torus instability can arise, particularly in the pres-
ence of strong currents (Shafranov, 1966). Conditions for the development of such instabilities were
determined in laboratory experiments (Myer et al., 2015). Of course, for ﬂares on the Sun and low-mass
stars, we cannot insist upon a speciﬁc type of instability, and more resonable to consider a more general
case of hydrodynamical instabilities in the plasma rope with the strong current.

Simulation of the current system throughout the AR is an important problem. Only now it has be-
come clear that strong currents and large Lorenz forces exist very low (up to 2-3 thousand km above
the photosphere). Higher in the corona, the ﬁelds rapidly become potential, and thin current sheets are
possibly present.

Another evidence in addition to the general considerations, is a complex behavior of the polarization
of microwave radiation. It is known that the polarization changes its sign when passing from the disk
center to the limb. This is because the beam enters quasi-transverse magnetic ﬁeld (QT-region) (e.g., see
Zheleznyakov, 1963; Peterova, 1973). In our case (see Fig. 3) we see the inversion of the polarization
sign at the frequency of 9.4 GHz at the same time (without motion of the source).

In addition to this well-known effect, a secondary short-time inversion was recorded at the frequency
of 2 GHz with the maximum polarized emission at 04:16 UT. This, in turn, suggests a complex topology
of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, when a complex polarization picture is due both to the projection effects,
and to increasing complexity of the coronal topology.

Thus, an “ideal” current system can exist within a small volume. But usually it is immersed into
various independent magnetic ﬂuxes separated by separatrix surfaces. As a result, the particularities
of the polarized emission that appear at low frequencies in the microwave range indicate the role of
reconnection in the coronal layers in AR. Note that the foundations for investigation of the topology of
the solar corona were laid by Lee et al. (2010).

Note also that two scenarios of events are possible in the Sun: (1) with coronal mass ejection (CME),
frequently observed, particularly, in major ﬂares and (2) with a rising loop without ejection (rarer events).
The latter was observed in the M-ﬂares on May 10, 2012.
