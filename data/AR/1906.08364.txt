ABSTRACT

AR Scorpii (AR Sco) is a binary star system containing the only known white dwarf (WD) pulsar.
Previously reported photometric datasets only provide coverage back to 2005, but we extend the
observational baseline for AR Sco back to the beginning of the 20th century by analyzing observations
from the Digital Access to a Sky Century at Harvard project (DASCH). We ﬁnd that the orbital
waveform of AR Sco remained constant across that baseline with no signiﬁcant deviations from its
average brightness. This result strongly suggests that the absence of accretion in modern observations
is a long-term feature of AR Sco. Additionally, the DASCH light curve provides an opportunity to
test an earlier prediction that an obliquity of the WD would result in a precessional period observable
in long-term studies of the orbital light curve. The DASCH observations do not indicate the presence
of such a period, and we show that previous, inconclusive tests of this hypothesis were insensitive to
the existence of a precessional period. Furthermore, the long DASCH baseline enables us to constrain
the rate of change of the orbital frequency to ˙ν (cid:46) 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1, constraining the eﬃcacy of
magnetic braking as a mechanism of angular-momentum loss in this system. Finally, we discuss how
the combination of the orbital waveform’s stability, high amplitude, and short period should make it
possible to identify additional WD pulsars in all-sky survey data.

1. INTRODUCTION

AR Sco is a binary star system with a white dwarf
(WD) and an M-dwarf companion that orbits once ev-
ery 3.56 hr. It generates highly periodic electromagnetic
pulses every 1.97 minutes, during which it brightens by
as much as a factor of 4. These pulses consist of syn-
chrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated
by the interaction between the WD’s magnetosphere and
the companion (Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017).
While the beat pulses (the diﬀerence between the WD
spin frequency and orbital frequency) were initially hy-
pothesized to arise on the companion star, a polarimetric
study by Potter & Buckley (2018b) challenged this in-
ference by showing that their origin appears to be ﬁxed
in the rotational frame of the WD, possibly within the
WD’s magnetosphere. Garnavich et al. (2019) presented
time-series spectroscopy that revealed the presence of
slingshot prominences on the companion star and sug-
gested that the beat pulses result from rapid magnetic
reconnection events, essentially stellar ﬂares, induced by
the magnetic interaction of the two magnetospheres.

Buckley et al. (2017) described the system as the
only known WD pulsar on the grounds that its rapid
pulses are powered by the spindown of the rapidly rotat-
ing, highly magnetized WD—though the mechanism of
emission is diﬀerent than in neutron-star pulsars. The
existence of the WD’s spindown was brieﬂy called in
doubt when Potter & Buckley (2018a) showed that the
spin-frequency derivative from the Marsh et al. (2016)
discovery paper did not agree with subsequent obser-
vations. However, Stiller et al. (2018) resolved this
controversy by measuring a spin-frequency derivative of
˙νspin = (5.14 ± 0.32) 10−17 Hz s−1 and calculating
that the resulting spindown energy was large enough to
power AR Sco’s characteristic pulses.

While AR Sco is perhaps most famous for its rapid
synchrotron pulses, its orbital light curve is notable in
its own right. The orbital modulation has a remark-
ably large peak-to-peak amplitude of ∼ 1.8 mag in the
V band (Littleﬁeld et al. 2017), and maximum light oc-
curs near orbital phase ∼0.4 (Marsh et al. 2016; Little-
ﬁeld et al. 2017), where orbital phase 0.0 is deﬁned as
the secondary’s time of inferior conjunction. Exploring

this peculiarity, Katz (2017) advances two possible ex-
planations. In his ﬁrst, he proposes that a magnetic bow
wave forms on the trailing hemisphere of the companion
star due to enhanced magnetic dissipation caused by the
rapid rotation of the WD’s magnetosphere. If the rota-
tion of the WD is prograde, the asymmetric heating of
the secondary would cause the orbital maximum to pre-
cede superior conjunction, as observed. Alternatively,
Katz (2017) suggests that the WD could be an oblique
rotator whose spin axis is misaligned with respect to the
orbital axis, resulting in enhanced magnetic dissipation
twice every orbit when the companion crosses the plane
swept out by the WD’s magnetic axis. For brevity, we
hereafter refer to this plane as the WD magnetic plane.
Katz (2017) identiﬁed a speciﬁc observational prediction
for this model: a WD precessional period of 20-200 yr.
Littleﬁeld et al. (2017) attempted to test the preces-
sional hypothesis by using photometry with a baseline
of 11 yr with indeterminate results, but as we will show,
their methodology was insensitive to the presence of a
precessional period.

Garnavich et al. (2019) further explored the orbital
light curve by showing that two basic models were each
capable of reproducing the orbital waveform, though
neither was unique. The ﬁrst model required the pres-
ence of two localized hotspots on the companion star:
one near the L1 region and a second on the hemisphere
facing away from the WD. Their second model invoked
the Katz (2017) oblique-rotator hypothesis and showed
that geometric viewing-angle eﬀects could reproduce the
observed orbital
light curve if the secondary experi-
enced enhanced heating twice each orbit when it crosses
through the WD magnetic plane.

The existing literature has not explored AR Sco’s be-
havior prior to 2005 (Marsh et al. 2016; Littleﬁeld et al.
2017), so its behavior during the 20th century is largely
unknown. To ﬁll this void, we use digitized photographic
plates to study AR Sco’s orbital light curve across a
century-long baseline.

2. DATA

2.1. DASCH

The Digital Access to a Sky Century at Harvard
project (DASCH) is an ongoing eﬀort to digitize 100
years of sky surveys from photographic plates (Grindlay
et al. 2009). We downloaded the light curve of AR Sco
from the DASCH pipeline using the default search radius
of 5” and the APASS B photometric calibration, which,
according to the DASCH documentation,1 is the mag-

nitude calibration that yields the most accurate pho-
tometry. With this dataset, our baseline runs back to
1902, albeit with occasional gaps, the most conspicuous
of which is the Menzel gap in the 1950s and 1960s (Fig.
1).

Figure 1. The DASCH light curve. We ﬁltered out the
green points according to our quality ﬂag criteria, and the
red points were ﬁltered out for exposure times greater than
75 minutes. The blue points represent our data after apply-
ing the quality cuts described in the text. Several discrepant
points are not shown because either their pipeline uncertain-
ties exceeded 1 mag or because an obvious plate defect was
present at their position. The astrophysical variability in
this ﬁgure is attributable to the orbital modulation because
even the shortest exposure times spanned many beat pulses.
We note no prolonged bright or dim states for AR Sco over
the course of this baseline.

The plates contained within DASCH vary widely in
quality, so an important part of using DASCH data is
ﬁltering out low-quality observations. To that end, each
DASCH observation is accompanied by a series of ﬂags
containing information about the reliability of the mea-
surement.2 After extensive experimentation with var-
ious quality criteria, we arrived at the following data
cuts. We exclude any measurements with AFLAGS with
bit positions of 6-12, 14, or 30; BFLAGS with bit posi-
tions of 1, 27, or 29; and quality ﬂags of 0-6, 11, and 12.
We also excluded plates whose limiting magnitude was
brighter than 14.5, since these plates lack the requisite
depth to detect AR Sco.

Given our objective of studying AR Sco’s short-period
variability across the DASCH baseline, it is important

2 A full explanation of the quality ﬂags is available from the
DASCH website at http://dasch.rc.fas.harvard.edu/database.php.

to know the exposure time of each plate. This informa-
tion is not included in the dataﬁle downloaded from the
DASCH pipeline, so we determined the exposure times
by retrieving metadata for each plate from the DASCH
website. Of the 127 plates that withstood our earlier
quality cuts, 77 had exposures times of 75 minutes or
less. The shortest exposures were just 10 minutes, while
at the other extreme, one plate had an exposure time
of 4 hr. Another 41 plates had exposure times of 2 hr.
Since even the shortest exposures averaged across ﬁve
beat cycles, the DASCH plates cannot provide insight
into the behavior of the fast pulses. They do, however,
probe the comparatively slow orbital modulation.

A subtle eﬀect of the vastly diﬀerent exposure times
is that long exposures will smear the orbital light curve,
distorting its shape and diluting the amplitude of vari-
ability. For some science objectives, such as checking for
a cessation of the orbital variability or a major brighten-
ing event, this eﬀect does not matter. However, it is an
important consideration when comparing the morphol-
ogy of the orbital waveform at diﬀerent epochs across
the DASCH baseline. We simulated this eﬀect by tak-
ing a Fourier-series representation of AR Sco’s orbital
waveform from the Stiller et al. (2018) photometry and
convolving it to diﬀerent exposure times. We found that
the shape of the waveform began to change quickly for
exposure times longer than 75 minutes, although this is
a subjective determination. Thus, in our timing analy-
sis, we analyzed only the plates with exposure times of
75 minutes or shorter.

After applying these cuts, we conﬁrmed that the re-
maining plates were all blue sensitive by ensuring that
the plate class for each plate was L (L. Smith 2019,
private communication). Therefore, no red- or yellow-
sensitive plates were included in our analysis.

Furthermore, in an eﬀort to better understand any
systematic errors in the DASCH plates for AR Sco, we
selected 20 check stars whose DASCH identiﬁers and
photometric properties are listed in Table 1. We se-
lected these stars by using the APASS catalog to iden-
tify stars within a radius of 4◦ of AR Sco that satisﬁed
two additional criteria: 14 < V < 15 and B − V < 0.5.
These ranges approximate AR Sco’s color (Garnavich
et al. 2019) and brightness (Littleﬁeld et al. 2017) near
its orbital maximum. Ideally, the check stars would be
closer to AR Sco, but since AR Sco lies along a heavily
reddened line of sight, there are relatively few nearby
blue stars. We extracted their light curves using the
DASCH pipeline and applied the same quality cuts as
we did with AR Sco. We also inspected images of the
check stars before and after the Menzel gap to ensure

that the stars did not suﬀer from blending.3 In Sec. 3.2,
we use these check stars to identify a systematic trend
in the post-Menzel-gap plates of AR Sco.

2.2. ASAS-SN

In order to extend the baseline in more recent years,
we incorporated all V -band photometry from the All-
Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN;
Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017). While the
DASCH light curve for AR Sco has not been analyzed
previously, Littleﬁeld et al. (2017) previously analyzed
ASAS-SN observations of AR Sco from 2014, 2015, and
2016. We add to this baseline ASAS-SN observations
from 2017 and 2018. Compared to the Harvard plates,
the ASAS-SN data are much more homogeneous and
tend to be of higher quality, providing a useful point of
comparison for the DASCH light curve.

In total, our dataset runs from 1902 until 2018, albeit
with large gaps in the middle of the 20th century, in the
1990s, and in the early 2000s.

3 As Schaefer (2016) has pointed out, the coarser plate scale of
the post-Menzel-gap plates creates an increased risk of blending.
Blended stars would appear to brighten in post-gap data, creating
the misleading appearance of a long-term brightening.

3. ANALYSIS

3.1. Long-term Photometric Stability

In the century-long light curve (Fig. 1), we note no
prolonged bright or dim states. While there are many
more detections of AR Sco fainter than 16th magnitude
between 1920 and 1950, this is simply because the limit-
ing magnitudes of those plates were deeper than at the
beginning and end of the DASCH light curve—a conse-
quence of the many diﬀerent telescopes, emulsions, and
observing sites that collectively make up the DASCH
light curve.

As shown in Fig. 2, we measured the orbital period
in the combined DASCH and ASAS-SN dataset to be
0.14853526(5) days by using phase-dispersion minimiza-
tion (PDM; Stellingwerf 1978) after ﬁrst applying a zero-
point oﬀset to better align the V -band ASAS-SN data
with the blue-sensitive DASCH measurements. In order
to ensure that the sheer number of the ASAS-SN mea-
surements did not overpower the data from DASCH in
the PDM analysis, we incorporated a random selection
of only 20% of the data from ASAS-SN, which we found
yielded a reasonable density of ASAS-SN points relative
to DASCH observations.

Figure 2. Period analysis using phase-dispersion minimiza-
tion. The orbital periods from Marsh et al. (2016) and from
a Lomb-Scargle analysis are plotted for reference. We take
the minimum outputted statistic to be the true orbital fre-
quency for AR Sco. We note that the value obtained from
our period analysis method is in strong agreement with the
orbital period obtained by Marsh et al. (2016).

In Fig. 3, we create a phase plot of the DASCH dataset
using the period from our PDM analysis and the time
of the secondary’s inferior conjunction (T0) from Marsh
et al. (2016). In order to highlight any time-dependent

trends in the data, the color of each marker indicates
the year of observation. The morphology of the orbital
waveform was constant across the observations, and al-
though ﬁve measurements from the 1980s appear to be
∼0.25 mag brighter than older measurements obtained
at similar orbital phases, we demonstrate in Sec. 3.2 that
this is very likely an instrumental eﬀect. Additionally,
while the heterogeneous nature of the DASCH plates in-
duces some scatter in the light curve, the phase of max-
imum light does not show any obvious drift, as would
occur if there were a signiﬁcant change in the orbital
period during the observations.

A comparison of the ASAS-SN and DASCH orbital
light curves reveals that the two waveforms are con-
sistent with each other (Fig. 4) with the exception of
a systematic brightness oﬀset that is almost certainly
the result of a bandpass diﬀerence between the V -band
ASAS-SN photometry and the blue-sensitive DASCH
observations. This ﬁnding suggests that there was no
major change in AR Sco’s orbital light curve between
the DASCH and ASAS-SN observations. The peak of
the orbital waveform is somewhat more clearly deﬁned
in the ASAS-SN data, probably because DASCH’s long
exposures average across much longer segments of the
orbital modulation than do ASAS-SN’s 90 s exposures.

3.2. The apparent long-term brightening is an

instrumental eﬀect

At ﬁrst glance, Fig. 4 seems to show that AR Sco’s
peak brightness increased by a quarter magnitude in the
1980s relative to the rest of the DASCH light curve, and
a weighted linear ﬁt suggests a gradual increase of 0.07
± 0.03 mag/decade. Upon closer examination, however,
this rise appears to be an instrumental eﬀect.

5

Figure 4. Left: phase plot using our orbital period and T0 from Marsh et al. (2016). Only 20% of the data points from
ASAS-SN were selected to improve visibility. Right: magnitude near orbital maximum, deﬁned as being between orbital phases
0.25 and 0.65, plotted against the year of data collection. The linear ﬁt is to the DASCH data only and is weighted according
to magnitude errors, and while it suggests a brightening of 0.07 ± 0.03 mag/decade, we show in Sec. 3.2 and Fig. 5 that it is
likely the result of an instrumental eﬀect in the ﬁnal ﬁve DASCH measurements, each of which is from the Damons South Blue
(DSB) series. We also plot the inferred B magnitude of the peak of the orbital waveform in ASAS-SN by adding a B − V of
0.25 (Garnavich et al. 2019) to the ASAS-SN V magnitude.

If the rise in AR Sco were of astrophysical origin, it
would not be present in check stars analyzed in an identi-
cal manner as AR Sco. However, as shown in Fig. 5, our
ensemble of 20 check stars appeared ∼0.25 mag brighter
in the ﬁnal years of DASCH, creating the illusion of a
long-term brightening trend similar to the one observed
in AR Sco. The eﬀect is even more dramatic when, in an
eﬀort to better match the sampling of AR Sco, we limit
our analysis of the check stars to years in which there
were DASCH observations of AR Sco that withstood our
quality cuts.

A close analysis of the DASCH plates reveals a possi-
ble systematic issue that might explain this eﬀect. The
plates obtained after the Menzel gap in our sample were
exclusively from the Damons South Blue (DSB) series,
which consisted of plates obtained between 1970-1973 at
Bloemfontein, 1978-1979 at Cerro Tololo, and 1981-1989
at Mt. John.4 In contrast, the pre-Menzel-gap plates
came from a variety of sources whose properties diﬀered
from the DSB series. In the lower panel of Fig. 5, we
show that the magnitudes of our check stars in the DSB
plates from Bloemfontein and Mt. John plates correlate
with how close the stars were to the limiting magnitude
of the plate. Stars that were just above the limiting mag-
nitude of the DSB plates tended to have their bright-
nesses underestimated by the DASCH pipeline, while

those that were well above the limiting magnitude were
usually brighter than expected. This eﬀect was espe-
cially acute in the DSB plates obtained at Mt. John,
the exclusive source of the ﬁve DSB plates included in
our analysis. Fig. 5 further establishes that the pre-
Menzel-gap plates did not show this eﬀect, and it does
not appear to be present in the Cerro Tololo DSB plates.
We stress that our sample of check stars has a very
narrow range of properties that approximate the broad-
band characteristics of AR Sco; it is not a representative
sample of all stars observed by DASCH, it would be in-
appropriate to extrapolate this ﬁnding to other DASCH
science cases without further analysis. Our work sug-
gests only that near AR Sco’s line of sight, relatively
blue stars of similar brightness to AR Sco tended to ap-
pear anomalously bright in the DSB plates (particularly
the Mt. John plates). This tendency refutes the appar-
ent brightening of AR Sco in DASCH. It is worth not-
ing that there has been a recent disagreement between
Schaefer (2016) and Hippke et al. (2016) over whether
the Damons North Blue series exhibits a ﬂux disconti-
nuity relative to the rest of the DASCH light curve.5 We
take no position on their debate. But because the Da-
mons plates are the predominant data source after the
Menzel gap, a ﬂux discontinuity—even if it appears only
under a very limited set of circumstances—could mas-

would be helpful if a future paper examined this issue
in detail.

3.3. Frequency Derivative Analysis

Angular-momentum losses should cause the orbital
period to slowly decrease due to a combination of mag-
netic braking and gravitational radiation. The long
baseline of the DASCH observations makes it possi-
ble to search for a resulting change in the orbital pe-
riod. Previously, Stiller et al. (2018) analyzed ASAS-
SN observations of AR Sco and used them to con-
strain any orbital-frequency derivative ( ˙ν) to be less
than 2 × 10−18 Hz s−1.

We used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) pro-
cedure to search for evidence of an orbital-frequency
derivative. Our model worked as follows. First, we cre-
ated a template orbital light curve by taking the ASAS-
SN V -band photometry, phasing it to the orbital period,
and convolving it to match the typical time resolution
of the DASCH plates that survived our quality cuts.
Next, our MCMC procedure explored diﬀerent combi-
nations of the orbital frequency and its derivative in an
eﬀort to minimize the squared residuals of the DASCH
observations from the template ASAS-SN light curve.
In addition to the orbital frequency and its derivative,
there were two other free parameters: a constant zero-
point oﬀset that was added to the template light curve,
and a multiplicative factor that scaled the amplitude
of the template to match the amplitude of the DASCH
observations (Fig. 6).

Our MCMC model also took into consideration the
limited timing accuracy of the plates, which the DASCH
project estimates from the number of signiﬁcant digits
from which the times for each plate were recorded. The
most common timing uncertainty in the data that we
used was ±11 minutes (∼0.05 in orbital phase), a signif-
icant source of uncertainty for a fast-varying object like
AR Sco. We found that if the timing uncertainties were
neglected, the MCMC results suggested the presence of
a frequency derivative; however, once we accounted for
the timing errors, the posterior distribution for the fre-
quency derivative tailed strongly toward 0, establish-
ing an upper limit on the orbital-frequency derivative of
˙ν (cid:46) 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1.

To check whether this constraint is reasonable, we
plotted the template ASAS-SN light curve and superim-
posed the phased DASCH observations for various com-
binations of ν and ˙ν. We found that when ˙ν (cid:46) 5×10−20
Hz s−1, any value of ˙ν could be oﬀset with a small change
to ν, providing conﬁrmation that the DASCH data are
not sensitive to such small values of ˙ν. However, when
we experimented with ˙ν (cid:38) 5 × 10−20 Hz s−1, it quickly
became impossible to ﬁnd a combination of ν and ˙ν that
caused the DASCH observations to match the template
light curve. This by-eye constraint on ˙ν supports the

Our constraint on the orbital-frequency derivative re-
inforces the conclusion by Stiller et al. (2018) that the
beat-frequency derivative in their dataset is exclusively
attributable to a change in the WD spin period and not
to the orbital period.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Testing the Precessional Model from Katz (2017)

If the orbital light curve were the result of uniform
irradiation of the companion star’s inner hemisphere,
the orbital phase of maximum light would coincide with
superior conjunction when we view the irradiated in-
ner hemisphere most directly. Instead, as Marsh et al.
(2016) ﬁrst noted, the orbital light curve peaks near
φorb ∼ 0.4. As discussed in Sec. 1, Katz (2017) pro-
posed that an obliquity of the WD could produce this
behavior and would also result in a precessional period
ranging from 20 to 200 yr. Katz (2017) pointed out
that an observable consequence of this model is that the
phase of orbital maximum would drift on timescales of
decades to centuries.

Katz (2017) and Littleﬁeld et al. (2017) suggested
that this hypothesis could be tested by searching for a
phase drift in the peak of the orbital maximum. Lit-
tleﬁeld et al. (2017) attempted to do so by phasing
sparsely sampled, archival light curves to the same pho-
tometric ephemeris and searching for evidence of a time-
dependent drift of the phase of maximum light. We
have determined, however, that their approach does not
meaningfully test the precessional model, as the eﬀects
of a secular phase drift from precession would precisely
mimic an imprecision in the orbital period.
If such a
phase drift were present in the data, period-ﬁnding al-
gorithms would simply report a photometric period that
diﬀers very slightly from the true orbital period. To
conﬁrm this, we created a synthetic orbital light curve,
matched its sampling to the DASCH data, and injected
a secular phase drift, similar to that proposed by Katz
(2017). We found that the PDM analysis compensated
for the phase drift by reporting a slightly diﬀerent period
than the known period, as expected. Thus, to have had
a realistic chance of detecting precession-related phase
drift in photometry, Littleﬁeld et al. (2017) would have
needed to phase the data to a suﬃciently precise spec-
troscopic measurement of the orbital period.

The Katz (2017) precessional model can be tested in
other ways. For example, it implicitly predicts that the
photometric period is the beat period between the pre-
cessional period and the orbital period. This inequal-
ity of the photometric and orbital periods would be de-

7

tectable across a suﬃciently long spectroscopic baseline.
For example, Marsh et al. (2016) measured the time
of inferior conjunction of the donor by measuring the
radial-velocity variations of its Na I absorption lines in
2015. Three years later, Garnavich et al. (2019) ob-
tained high time-resolution spectroscopy covering most
of an orbit, and the time of inferior conjunction in these
spectra can be compared against the Marsh et al. (2016)
value to search for any evidence of a diﬀerence between
the orbital and photometric periods.

We obtained the Garnavich et al. (2019) spectra and
reduced them as described in that paper. We phased
the Garnavich et al. (2019) spectra using a linear orbital
ephemeris consisting of the Marsh et al. (2016) time of
inferior conjunction and our photometric period, and we
then ﬁt a sinusoid to the radial-velocity variations of the
K I λ7699˚A absorption line, which was one of the few
absorption features not to be signiﬁcantly impacted by
telluric absorption. The best-ﬁt sinusoid revealed the
phase of inferior conjunction to be φ = 0.01 ± 0.02. The
measurement error suggests that we could have detected
a phase shift as small as ±0.04 at 2σ; dividing the three-
year spectroscopic baseline by this phase shift suggests
that we can rule out any precessional period shorter than
∼ 75 yr at 2σ conﬁdence. Therefore, there is no evidence
of a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the photometric and
spectroscopic periods, and as the spectroscopic baseline
increases, the constraints on any WD precessional period
will become increasingly rigorous.

Another way of testing the Katz (2017) hypothesis is
to search for evidence of an amplitude modulation whose
period is consistent with the proposed precessional peri-
ods. For instance, Garnavich et al. (2019) showed that
if the inner hemisphere of the secondary is uniformly
heated and experiences enhanced heating twice each or-
bit when it passes through the magnetic plane, the ob-
served orbital light curve could be reproduced with re-
markable accuracy. The precessional period proposed
by Katz (2017) would induce changes in both the am-
plitude and the shape of the orbital light curve, and the
long baseline of the DASCH observations would likely
reveal any such variation if it existed. However, in light
of the analysis in Sec. 3.2, there is no evidence of such a
trend in AR Sco. As Katz (2017) did not predict how the
waveform would change across the precessional cycle, it
is diﬃcult to use the absence of an amplitude modula-
tion to constrain the length of the precessional period,
so our spectroscopic constraint is more quantitatively
rigorous.

We conclude that the precessional model proposed by
Katz (2017) is inconsistent with the available data and
that the marginal evidence of a time-dependent phase

be interpreted as supportive evidence of the precessional
model.

4.2. Angular-momentum Losses and ˙ν

The orbital periods of close M-dwarf and WD binaries
decrease due to angular-momentum losses, principally
from magnetic braking (MB; for systems with orbital
periods above ∼3 hr) and gravitational radiation (for
systems with shorter orbital periods). The observation
of orbital decay in some close binaries containing a pair

tion of the predicted behavior of gravitational radiation,
but tests of magnetic braking have proven more diﬃcult
for several reasons. For example, there is no universally
agreed upon prescription for magnetic braking (Knigge
et al. 2011). Moreover, observational measurements of
the orbital-period derivative are diﬃcult because they
require a long baseline of observations, and other phe-
nomena, such as mass transfer, which can contribute to
the period derivative. A system with negligible mass-
transfer, like AR Sco, therefore presents an opportunity
to measure the orbital decay due to magnetic braking
without the complicating eﬀects of mass transfer.

Knigge et al. (2011) constructed a semi-empirical
model of cataclysmic variable (CV) evolution and found
that a pairing of scaled versions of angular-momentum
losses due to gravitational radiation and the Rappa-
port et al. (1983) parameterization of MB accurately
described the CV evolutionary sequence. Their revised
evolutionary model (Table 4 in Knigge et al. (2011)) pre-
dicts that at AR Sco’s orbital period, the rate of angular-
momentum loss is ˙JMB = 1.3 × 1035 dyn cm, compared
against an orbital angular momentum of J = 1.2 × 1051

the expected ˙JMB from the revised evolutionary track in

The anticipated ˙νMB is marginally below our upper
limit of ˙ν < 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1, suggesting that over the
course of our baseline, the time-averaged rate of angular-
momentum loss due to MB could have been at most only
a factor of ∼ 2 above the prediction of the Knigge et al.
(2011) revised evolutionary model.

4.3. Identifying Additional WD pulsars

AR Sco is the only known WD pulsar and is remark-
ably close, with a Gaia distance of 117.4+0.5
−0.6 pc (Bailer-
Jones et al. 2018). This proximity suggests that ad-
ditional WD pulsars might also be relatively nearby
and observable, though observational biases have pre-
vented their identiﬁcation as such. Indeed, as Marsh et
al. (2016) noted, AR Sco was originally classiﬁed as a
δ Scuti star, and were it not for fortuitous fast-cadence

the VSX database. We have also included overcontact bina-
ries because of the possibility that some of these stars might
be misclassiﬁed as pulsating stars if their light curves are
poorly sampled; the overcontact binaries account for most of
the dense cluster of points above 5 hours. At the exposure
times of most surveys, AR Sco-type objects will appear to
be highly coherent pulsating stars, but AR Sco’s discordantly
high amplitude of pulsation suggests a basis for distinguish-
ing WD pulsars from pulsating stars with a similar period.
As discussed in the text, this approach is best-suited to WD
pulsars with moderate-to-high orbital inclinations.

photometry by amateur astronomers, this system would
likely still be consigned to obscurity. The eﬃcient iden-
tiﬁcation of additional AR Sco-type objects is therefore
an important next step in the study of the WD pulsar
phenomenon.

By establishing that the orbital light curve of AR
Sco has remained remarkably stable for over a century,
the DASCH light curve underscores that a WD pulsar’s
orbital light curve is arguably the most feasible way
of identifying candidate WD pulsars in large datasets.
While existing surveys generally have insuﬃcient time
resolution to detect AR Sco’s fast pulsations, they are
much more sensitive to high-amplitude, hours-long, and
highly coherent periodicities like AR Sco’s orbital light
curve. The absence of a discernible amplitude modula-
tion of the DASCH light curve means that AR Sco-type
objects would probably appear in these datasets to be
extraordinarily high-amplitude δ Scuti stars, as AR Sco
itself was long believed to be. To illustrate how unusual
AR Sco’s light curve is compared to genuine pulsating
stars, we downloaded the periods and amplitudes of all
short-period pulsators from the AAVSO VSX database
(Watson et al. 2006), and in Fig. 7, we indicate how
AR Sco’s amplitude of orbital variation far exceeds the
amplitudes of pulsators with comparable periods.

A number of all-sky surveys are sensitive to high-
amplitude variability with periodicities of a few hours
and can be used to identify candidate AR Sco-type ob-
jects. Ground-based surveys such as ASAS-SN, ATLAS,
and PanSTARRS have the requisite depth and sky cov-
erage to detect candidate AR Sco-type objects. The
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ) mission
is another option, as it is observing a majority of the
sky at a 30 minute cadence. However, the low angular
resolution of TESS means that blending would suppress
the apparent amplitude of an AR Sco-type object, so a
deblending algorithm would almost certainly be neces-
sary.

A deep, all-sky catalog of periodic variables that show
AR Sco-type waveforms could then be searched for rapid
variability to identify true AR Sco-type objects, the
successful identiﬁcation of which would shed light on
the evolutionary status of WD pulsars, their occurrence
rate, and how they relate with intermediate polars.

An important caveat is that the orbital modulation
is undoubtedly sensitive to the orbital inclination, so
even if AR Sco’s properties are typical of the population
of WD pulsars, low-inclination WD pulsars will show
much lower-amplitude orbital modulations than AR Sco,

whose inclination has been estimated to be ∼ 60◦ (Gar-
navich et al. 2019).

5. CONCLUSION

Using the DASCH light curve to extend the photo-
metric baseline of AR Sco, we establish that the orbital
light curve has remained remarkably consistent since the
early 20th century. These observations suggest that the
mechanism that powers the orbital light curve has re-
mained constant over the course of a century and is a
long-term feature of AR Sco.

Additionally, we

constrain the orbital-frequency
derivative to be ˙ν (cid:46) 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1 providing
constraints on the eﬃcacy of magnetic braking in this
system. Our constraint is in agreement with the pre-
dicted orbital-frequency derivative from magnetic brak-
ing in the revised evolutionary model in Knigge et al.
(2011), and it reinforces the conclusion from Stiller et
al. (2018) that their measurement of the beat-frequency
derivative is fully attributable to the spindown of the
WD and not to an orbital-frequency derivative.
