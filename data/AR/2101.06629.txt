ABSTRACT

Context. Coronal jets are ubiquitous in active regions (ARs) and coronal holes.
Aims. In this paper, we study a coronal jet related to a C3.4 circular-ribbon ﬂare in active region 12434 on 2015 October 16.
Methods. The ﬂare and jet were observed in ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the photosphere were
observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO. The whole event was covered by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during its imaging and spectroscopic observations. Soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂuxes of the ﬂare were recorded
by the GOES spacecraft. Hard X-ray (HXR) ﬂuxes at 4−50 keV were obtained from observations of RHESSI and Fermi. Radio
dynamic spectra of the ﬂare were recorded by the ground-based stations belonging to the e-Callisto network.
Results. Two miniﬁlaments were located under a 3D fan-spine structure before ﬂare. The ﬂare was generated by the eruption of one
ﬁlament. The kinetic evolution of the jet was divided into two phases: a slow rise phase at a speed of ∼131 km s−1 and a fast rise phase
at a speed of ∼363 km s−1 in the plane-of-sky. The slow rise phase may correspond to the impulsive reconnection at the breakout
current sheet. The fast rise phase may correspond to magnetic reconnection at the ﬂare current sheet. The transition between the two
phases occurred at ∼09:00:40 UT. The blueshifted Doppler velocities of the jet in the Si iv 1402.80 Å line range from -34 to -120 km
s−1. The accelerated high-energy electrons are composed of three groups. Those propagating upward along open ﬁeld generate type
III radio bursts, while those propagating downward produce HXR emissions and drive chromospheric condensation observed in the
Si iv line. The electrons trapped in the rising ﬁlament generate a microwave burst lasting for ≤40 s. Bidirectional outﬂows at the base
of jet are manifested by signiﬁcant line broadenings of the Si iv line. The blueshifted Doppler velocities of outﬂows range from -13
to -101 km s−1. The redshifted Doppler velocities of outﬂows range from ∼17 to ∼170 km s−1.
Conclusions. Our multiwavelength observations of the ﬂare-related jet are in favor of the breakout jet model and are important for
understanding the acceleration and transport of nonthermal electrons.

1. Introduction

Jet-like activities as a result of magnetic reconnection are ubiqui-
tous in the solar atmosphere. Small-scale jets with lower energy
budgets and shorter lifetimes include spicules (De Pontieu et al.
2004; Samanta et al. 2019), chromospheric jets (Shibata et al.
2007; Liu et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2014a), bidirectional plasma
jets related to explosive events (Innes et al. 1997; Li et al.
2018a), coronal nanojets (Antolin et al. 2020) and mini-jets
(Chen et al. 2020). Large-scale jets with higher energy bud-
gets and longer lifetimes include Hα surges (Schmieder et al.
1995; Liu & Kurokawa 2004) and coronal jets (Cirtain et al.
2007; Savcheva et al. 2007; Shimojo et al. 2007; Raouaﬁ et al.
2016; Shen 2021). Coronal jets are transient collimated outﬂows
propagating along open magnetic ﬁeld or large-scale closed
loops (Shibata et al. 1992, 1994; Zhang et al. 2012; Huang et al.
2012, 2020). The speeds of jets can reach hundreds of km s−1
(Shimojo et al. 1996; Culhane et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2019). The

presence of open ﬁeld facilitates the escape of electron beams
accelerated by reconnection at the jet base and the generation
of type III radio bursts (e.g., Krucker et al. 2011; Glesener et al.
2012; Glesener & Fleishman 2018).

Although the morphology of jets varies from case to case,
most of them show an inverse-Y shape or a two-sided shape
(Moore et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2019). The temperature of a jet
decreases from ∼10 MK at the base (Shimojo & Shibata 2000;
Chifor et al. 2008; Bain & Fletcher 2009) to a few MK along the
spire (Zhang & Ji 2014b). Sometimes, the hot, fast extreme ul-
traviolet (EUV) jet is adjacent to or mixed with the cool, slow
Hα jet (Shen et al. 2017; Sakaue et al. 2017, 2018; Hou et al.
2020). The electron densities of jets range from ≥108 cm−3
(Young & Muglach 2014) to ≥1010 cm−3 (Mulay et al. 2017).
Bright and compact blobs (or plasmoids) are discovered in coro-
nal jets (Zhang & Ji 2014b; Li & Yang 2019; Zhang & Ni 2019;
Joshi et al. 2020a), which are mainly interpreted by magnetic
islands as a result of tearing-mode instability in the current

sheet (Wyper et al. 2016; Ni et al. 2017). Recurring jets pro-
duced by successive energy release at the same region are com-
mon (Chifor et al. 2008; Hong et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2019). Aside
from the radial motion, untwisting motions have been detected in
helical jets, implying rapid release and transfer of magnetic he-
licity (Chen et al. 2012; Zhang & Ji 2014a; Cheung et al. 2015;
Doyle et al. 2019; Joshi et al. 2020b).

In spite of substantial investigations on jets using mul-
tiwavelength observational data, the triggering mechanism is
an important issue that needs to be addressed. Till now, sev-
eral mechanisms have been proposed, such as magnetic ﬂux
emergence and reconnection with pre-existing magnetic ﬁelds
(Yokoyama & Shibata 1996; Archontis & Hood 2013), mag-
netic cancellation (Panesar et al. 2016; Sterling et al. 2017),
miniﬁlament eruption (Sterling et al. 2015; Hong et al. 2017;
Li et al. 2018b), and photospheric rotation (Pariat et al. 2009).
Wyper et al. (2017) performed three-dimensional (3D) magne-
tohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical simulations of a coronal
jet driven by ﬁlament ejection, whereby a region of strongly
sheared magnetic ﬁeld near the solar surface becomes unsta-
ble and erupts. The authors concluded that energy is initially
released via magnetic reconnection at the thin breakout current
sheet above the ﬂux rope, which is followed by continuing en-
ergy release at the thin ﬂare current sheet beneath the erupting
ﬁlament (or ﬂux rope). The kinetic evolution of the jet is appar-
ently divided into a slow rise phase before the ﬂux rope opens up
and a fast rise phase after the rope totally opens up, which cor-
respond to magnetic reconnections at the breakout current sheet
and ﬂare current sheet, respectively (Wyper et al. 2018, see their
Fig. 5). The breakout jet model is veriﬁed observationally by the
signatures of a rotating jet and fast degradation of the circular
ﬂare ribbon following the coherent brightenings of the ribbon as-
sociated with the jet (Zhang et al. 2020). Breakout reconnection
at the null point of a fan-spine structure is recently evidenced
by the bidirectional outﬂows ejected from the reconnection site
(Yang et al. 2020). However, reconnection at the ﬂare current
sheet below the jet has not been noticed.

In this paper, we report our multiwavelengths of a coronal jet
related to a C3.4 circular-ribbon ﬂare that induced simultaneous
transverse oscillations of a coronal loop and a ﬁlament (Zhang
2020). The ﬂare occurred in NOAA active region (AR) 12434
where a series of homologous ﬂares were produced (Zhang et al.
2016a,b). This paper is arranged as follows. Data analysis is de-
scribed in Sect. 2. The results are presented in Sect. 3 and com-
pared with previous works in Sect. 4. Finally, a brief summary is
given in Sect. 5.

2. Observations and data analysis

The C3.4 ﬂare and jet were observed by the Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO) on 2015 October 16. SDO/AIA takes
full-disk images in two ultraviolet (UV; 1600 and 1700 Å) and
seven EUV (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335 Å) wave-
lengths. The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the photo-
sphere were observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board SDO. The level_1
data of AIA and HMI were calibrated using the standard solar
software (SSW) program aia_prep.pro and hmi_prep.pro,
respectively.

The ﬂare and jet were also observed by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014) Slit-Jaw
Imager (SJI) in 1330 Å (log T ≈ 4.4) and 1400 Å (log T ≈ 4.8)

with a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 134′′×129′′. Spectroscopic ob-
servation of the ﬂare was in the “large coarse 8-step raster”
mode using four spectral windows (C ii, Mg ii, O i, and Si
iv). Each raster had 8 steps from east to west and covered
an area of 14′′×129′′. The step cadence and exposure time
were ∼10 s and 8 s. The spectra were preprocessed using the
standard SSW programs iris_orbitvar_corr_l2.pro and
iris_prep_despike.pro. The Si iv 1402.80 Å line (log T ≈
4.8) is optically thin and can be ﬁtted by single or multicompo-
nent Gaussian functions. The reference line center of Si iv is set
to be 1402.80 Å (Li et al. 2015a; Yu et al. 2020a). The uncer-
tainty in Doppler velocity is ∼2 km s−1.

Soft X-ray (SXR) light curves of the ﬂare in 0.5−4 and 1−8
Å were recorded by the GOES spacecraft. Hard X-ray (HXR)
ﬂuxes of the ﬂare at diﬀerent energy bands were obtained from
observations of the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spec-
troscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) and the Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM; Meegan et al. 2009) on board the Fermi
spacecraft. The time cadence of Fermi/GBM switched from an
ordinary value of 0.256 s before ﬂare to 0.064 s during the ﬂare.
Radio dynamic spectra of the ﬂare were recorded by the ground-
based stations belonging to the e-Callisto network1. The obser-
vational parameters are listed in Table 1.

To obtain the 3D magnetic conﬁguration of the AR be-
fore ﬂare, we utilize the “weighted optimization” method
(Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012) to perform a non-
linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation based on the pho-
tospheric vector magnetograms observed by HMI at 08:48 UT.
The azimuthal component of the inverted vector magnetic ﬁeld
was processed to correct the 180◦ ambiguity (Leka et al. 2009).
The vector ﬁeld in the image plane was transformed to the he-
liographic plane (Gary & Hagyard 1990). The extrapolation was
carried out within a box of 380×400×512 uniformly spaced grid
points with dx = dy = dz = 1′′. 2. The squashing factor Q
(Demoulin et al. 1996; Titov et al. 2002) and twist number Tw
(Berger & Prior 2006) were calculated with the code developed
by Liu et al. (2016).

3. Results

3.1. Miniﬁlamenteruption and circular-ribbon ﬂare

Figure 1(a) shows the SXR light curves of the ﬂare. The SXR
emissions started to rise at ∼08:58 UT and reached peak val-

topology is clearly depicted by the blue and yellow lines, and
the outer spine is connected to a remote negative polarity to the
southeast of fan dome. Below the dome, the green and light vi-
olet lines represent the ﬁeld lines of F1 and F2, respectively.
A close-up of the ﬂare region is displayed in Fig. 2(c). The
magnetic ﬁelds supporting the two miniﬁlaments are sheared ar-
cades instead of twisted ﬂux ropes. The Tw lies in the range of
0.45−0.65 for the lower F1 and 0.6−0.7 for the upper F2. Fig-
ure 3(d) shows the spatial distribution of log Q within the ﬂare
region, highlighting the closed ribbon of high Q, which is excel-
lently cospatial with the bright circular ribbon (Fig. 2(c)).

The ﬂare was accompanied by type III radio bursts at
250−350 MHz. In Fig. 4, the bottom panel shows the ra-
dio dynamic spectra of the ﬂare recorded by e-Callisto/KRIM.
The bursts with fast frequency drift rates are noticeable dur-
ing 08:59:10−09:00:40 UT. The radio ﬂuxes at 280, 300, 320,
and 340 MHz are extracted and plotted with colored lines in
Fig. 1(d). It is revealed that the peaks in radio are roughly cor-
related with the peaks in HXR, suggesting their common origin.
The reconnection-accelerated electrons propagate downward to
produce HXR emissions in the chromosphere and propagate up-
ward along open ﬁeld to produce type III bursts at the same time
(Zhang et al. 2016b). Combining with the results of extrapola-
tion in Fig. 3, the real magnetic conﬁguration of the ﬂare region
is consistent with previous schematic illustration (Wang & Liu
2012, see their Fig. 1).

3.2. Coronal jet

To investigate the radial propagation of the jet, an artiﬁcial slice
(S1) along the jet spire is selected in Fig. 2(d), which is ∼80′′
in length. Time-distance diagrams of S1 in 94 Å (log T ≈ 6.8),
171 Å (log T ≈ 5.8), and 304 Å (log T ≈ 4.7) are displayed in
Fig. 5. The jet is distinctly observed in all EUV wavelengths, in-
dicating its multithermal nature (Zhang & Ji 2014b; Joshi et al.
2020a). The kinetic evolution is divided into two phases: a slow
rise phase at a plane-of-sky speed of ∼131 km s−1 and a fast
rise phase at a speed of ∼363 km s−1, respectively. The transi-
tion between the two phases occurred at ∼09:00:40 UT, which is
denoted by the magenta dashed line. Impulsive heating to reach
a temperature of ≥6 MK is concurrent with the turning point
(panel (a)). The evolution of jet is basically consistent with the
breakout model (Wyper et al. 2017, 2018). Magnetic reconnec-
tions at the breakout current sheet and ﬂare current sheet lead to
intense electron acceleration and heating.

In Fig. 6, the 1330 Å images observed by IRIS/SJI illus-
trate the evolution of ﬂare and jet in FUV wavelength, which
is similar to that in EUV wavelengths. Coherent brightenings
of the circular ribbon took place around 09:00:07 UT, indicat-
ing null point reconnection (see panel (c) and the online movie
anim1330.mov). Unfortunately, the southern part of ﬂare and
major part of jet spire were not observed due to the limited FOV
of IRIS. The raster observations enable us to carry out spectral
analysis of the ﬂare and jet base. In Fig. 7, the left column shows
selected FUV images observed by SJI when the jet was covered
by the slit. The right column shows the corresponding Si iv spec-
tra of the slit. The spectra of the jet are generally blueshifted,
meaning that the jet materials are moving toward the observer.

To precisely quantify the Doppler velocities of the jet, the
line proﬁles of Si iv at the positions marked with cyan lines
are extracted and plotted with orange lines in Fig. 8. The en-
tirely blueshifted proﬁles are satisfactorily ﬁtted with a single-
Gaussian function (blue lines in panels (b-e)), and the calcu-

ues at ∼09:03 UT before declining gradually until ∼09:12 UT.
In Fig. 2, the EUV images observed by AIA in 304 Å illus-
trate the whole evolution of the event (see also the online movie
anim304.mov). Before ﬂare, two short miniﬁlaments (F1 and F2)
resided in the AR (panel (a)). With the slow rising of F2, the
EUV intensities of the ﬂare started to increase at ∼08:58 UT and
reached peak values at ∼09:00 UT (panels (b-c)). Meanwhile,
a coronal jet propagates in the southeast direction, which was
also observed in 1600 Å (panel (g)). The F1 close to F2, how-
ever, was undisturbed and survived the ﬂare (panel (f)). Both
of the miniﬁlaments were located along the polarity inversion
lines (panel (h)). The morphology and evolution of the C3.4 ﬂare
were quite analogous to those of C4.2 ﬂare starting at ∼13:36 UT
(Zhang et al. 2016a; Dai et al. 2020).

HXR light curves of the ﬂare recorded by RHESSI and Fermi
at diﬀerent energy bands are plotted in Fig. 1(b-c). Note that
there was no observation from RHESSI until 09:00:20 UT. Be-
fore 08:59:42 UT, there were two small peaks (panel (c)). The
HXR emissions at 11−26 keV and 26−50 keV started to increase
sharply at 08:59:42 UT and peaked at 09:00:20 UT before de-
creasing to ∼09:00:40 UT. The HXR peaks indicate that the most
drastic release of energy and particle acceleration took place dur-
ing 08:59:42−09:00:40 UT (∼60 s). Afterwards, the HXR emis-
sions between 4 and 26 keV increased gradually and peaked
around 09:02:00 UT before decreasing slowly until ∼09:04:30
UT, implying their thermal nature from hot plasma (∼10 MK) as
a result of ongoing chromospheric evaporation.

Figure 2(h) shows the LOS magnetogram of the ﬂare region
observed by HMI at 08:58:15 UT, featuring a central negative
polarity surrounded by positive polarities. Such a magnetic pat-
tern is indicative of the fan-spine topology in the corona (e.g.,
Zhang et al. 2012; Li et al. 2018b; Hou et al. 2019; Yang et al.
2020). In Fig. 3, the left panels demonstrate the top and side
views of 3D magnetic conﬁguration of AR 12434. The fan-spine

3.3. Chromospheric condensation

Chromospheric condensation at circular ﬂare ribbons has been
observed and investigated in the homologous C3.1 and C4.2
ﬂares (Zhang et al. 2016a,b). The redshifted velocities of the
downﬂow reach up to ∼60 km s−1 using the observations of Si
iv line. The condensation is primarily driven by reconnection-
accelerated nonthermal electrons (Li et al. 2015b, 2017). In
Fig. 9, likewise, the left column shows selected FUV images
observed by SJI when the circular ribbon was covered by the
slit. The right column shows the corresponding Si iv spectra of
the slit. The spectra of ribbon are redshifted, indicating plasma
downﬂow or chromospheric condensation.

To quantify the Doppler velocities of condensation, the line
proﬁles of Si iv at the positions marked with cyan lines are ex-
tracted and plotted with orange lines in Fig. 10. The proﬁles are
ﬁtted with a double-Gaussian function (red and magenta lines),

and the sum of two components are drawn with cyan dashed
lines, which gratifyingly agree with the observed proﬁles. The
calculated Doppler velocities (vr) of the redshifted component
are labeled on top of each panel. In Fig. 12, the values of vr,
ranging from ∼20 to ∼80 km s−1, are marked with red circles.
The cause of condensation will be discussed in Sect. 4.2.

3.4. Bidirectionaloutﬂows

As mentioned before, magnetic reconnection occurs not only at
the breakout current sheet above the eruptive ﬁlament (or ﬂux
rope) but also at the ﬂare current sheet below the ﬂux rope
(Wyper et al. 2017, 2018). In Fig. 9, dramatic line broadenings
of the Si iv line at the jet base are shown in panels (b2), (b3),
(b4), (d2), and (d4), implying simultaneous bidirectional recon-
nection outﬂows below the jet (e.g., Tian et al. 2014b; Li et al.
2018c; Xue et al. 2018). To work out the Doppler velocities of
outﬂows, the line proﬁles of Si iv at the positions marked with
short green lines are extracted and plotted with orange lines in
Fig. 11. The proﬁles are ﬁtted with a triple-Gaussian function
(blue, magenta, and red lines) except in panel (c), which is ﬁtted

with a double-Gaussian function. The sum of multiple compo-
nents are drawn with cyan dashed lines. The calculated Doppler
velocities of the redshifted component (vr) and blueshifted com-
ponent (vb) are labeled on top of each panel. In Fig. 12, the ve-
locities of reconnection upﬂow, in the range of -13 and -101 km
s−1, are marked with blue triangles. The velocities of reconnec-
tion downﬂow, in the range of ∼17 to ∼170 km s−1, are marked
with red triangles. We note that the fast reconnection outﬂows
are observed after 09:00:40 UT, when the jet is rising quickly at
a speed of ∼363 km s−1.

It should be emphasized that the chromospheric condensa-
tion takes place at the circular ribbon as marked by short cyan
lines in Fig. 9. Only redshifted downﬂow at speeds of 20−80 km
s−1 could be identiﬁed in the spectra (Figs. 9, 10). The bidirec-
tional outﬂows are observed inside the circular ribbon and close
to the jet base. Simultaneous upﬂow and downﬂow could be rec-
ognized in the spectra (Figs. 9, 11) and the Doppler velocities
of bidirectional outﬂows are signiﬁcantly higher than those of
condensation. These are the main diﬀerences between chromo-
spheric condensation and bidirectional outﬂows.

4. Discussion

4.1. Magneticreconnection

Magnetic reconnection is believed to play a key role in
the energy release of solar ﬂares (Priest & Forbes 2002;
Priest & Pontin 2009). Direct evidences of reconnection at
current sheets are abundant, including the bidirectional in-
ﬂows and outﬂows (e.g., Savage et al. 2012; Ning & Guo 2014;
Wu et al. 2016; Xue et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Chen et al.
2020; Yu et al. 2020b), change of magnetic topology (Su et al.
localized heating to ≥10 MK (Seaton et al. 2017;
2013),
Li et al. 2018c; Warren et al. 2018), and creation of magnetic is-
lands (Li et al. 2016). Using 3D MHD numerical simulations,
Wyper et al. (2017) proposed a universal model for solar erup-
tions, including eruptive ﬂares and coronal jets. Breakout recon-
nection around an X-type null point in a quadrupolar magnetic
conﬁguration is observed and investigated by Chen et al. (2016).
Observations of fast reconnection at the breakout current sheet
of a fan-spine structure are carried out by Yang et al. (2020).

In our study, impulsive interchange reconnection at the null
point was manifested by coherent brightenings of the circular
ribbon, HXR peaks, and type III radio bursts around 09:00:00
UT (Fig. 1(c-d) and Fig. 6(c)). Line broadening as a result of
bidirectional outﬂows was absent before the miniﬁlament broke
through the fan surface. During the reconnection at the ﬂare
current sheet underneath the ﬁlament, pronounced upﬂows and
downﬂows at the jet base were evidenced by signiﬁcant Doppler
line broadenings of Si iv. The jet did not show untwisting motion
during its radial propagation, which is probably due to the small
Tw of the sheared arcade supporting the miniﬁlament. Taken as a
whole, our multiwavelength observations of the ﬂare-related jet
support the breakout jet model (Wyper et al. 2018).

Using combined observations of a small prominence erup-
tion on 2014 May 1, Reeves et al. (2015) found evidence for
reconnection between the prominence magnetic ﬁeld and the
overlying ﬁeld. Reconnection outﬂows at a plane-of-sky speed
of ∼300 km s−1 and Doppler velocity of ∼200 km s−1 were de-
tected by SDO/AIA and IRIS, respectively. Moreover, possible
reconnection site below the prominence is found (see their Fig.
10). The authors, however, concluded that the reconnection was
triggered not by breakout reconnection, but by reconnection oc-
curring along and beneath the prominence.

Using multiwavelength observations from SDO, Hin-
ode/XRT, IRIS, and the DST of Hida Observatory, Sakaue et al.
(2018) analyzed a jet-related C5.4 ﬂare on 2014 November 11.
The morphology and magnetic conﬁguration of the jet were
somewhat similar to the jet in our study. However, the C5.4
ﬂare and jet were caused by magnetic reconnection between the
emerging magnetic ﬂux of the satellite spots and the pre-existing
ambient ﬁelds (Sakaue et al. 2017). Part of the cool Hα jet expe-
rienced secondary acceleration between the trajactories of the
Hα jet and the hot SXR jet after it had been ejected from the
lower atmosphere, which is explained by magnetic reconnection
between the preceding Hα jet and the plasmoid in the subse-
quent SXR jet. In our case, the circular-ribbon ﬂare was caused
by eruption of a miniﬁlament underlying the null point (Figs. 2,
3). The fast rise of the jet after ∼09:00:40 UT may result from
quick ejection of F2 after null-point reconnection (Wyper et al.
2018). The reconnection upﬂow at the ﬂare current sheet may
also contribute to the acceleration of jet, as in the case of coronal
mass ejections (CMEs; Zhang et al. 2004).

4.2. Cause of chromospheric condensation

As mentioned above, chromospheric condensation could be
driven by electron beam heating (e.g., Li et al. 2015a,b; Yu et al.
2020a). During the C4.2 ﬂare on 2015 October 16, explosive
chromospheric evaporation took place, which was characterized
by plasma upﬂow at speeds of 35−120 km s−1 in the Fe xxi
1354.09 Å line (log T ≈ 7.05) and downﬂow at speeds of 10−60
km s−1 in the Si iv 1393.77 Å line (Zhang et al. 2016a). The esti-
mated nonthermal energy ﬂux above 20 keV exceeds the thresh-
old (∼1010 erg s−1 cm−2) for explosive evaporation (Fisher et al.
1985). Condensation during the C3.1 ﬂare associated with a
type III burst is also believed to be driven by electron beams
(Zhang et al. 2016b).

To explore the cause of condensation during the C3.4 ﬂare,
we focus on nonthermal electrons as usual. In Fig. 2(g), the AIA
1600 Å image at 09:00:39 UT is superposed with intensity con-
tours of HXR emission at 12−25 keV during 09:00:20−09:00:40
UT (magenta lines). The centroid of the single HXR source is
cospatial with the bright inner ribbon, where majority of non-
thermal electrons are precipitated. In Fig. 13, the HXR spectrum
obtained from RHESSI observation is ﬁtted with a thermal com-
ponent plus a thick-target, nonthermal component consisting of
a broken power law (Rubio da Costa et al. 2015):

F(E) = (δ − 1)

where δ and Ec represent the spectral index and cutoﬀ energy of

nonthermal electrons. Fc =

a red dashed line, with the values of thermal temperature (T ),
emission measure (EM) being labeled. The ﬁtted nonthermal
component is plotted with a blue dashed line, with the values
of δ and Ec being labeled as well. The sum of two components
(magenta dashed line) agrees with the observed spectrum.

Before ∼09:00:40 UT, the HXR emissions were predomi-
nantly produced by nonthermal electrons (Fig. 1(c)). The power
of injected electrons above Ec is expressed as:

Substituting the parameters obtained from HXR spectral ﬁtting

keV, then Pnth is estimated to be ∼1.3×1028 erg s−1. A lower
limit of the total nonthermal energy in electrons is ∼2.6×1029
erg, since there was no RHESSI observation before 09:00:20
UT. Considering that the area of HXR source is in the range
of (0.25−1)×1018 cm2, the total nonthermal energy ﬂux is esti-
mated to be (1.3−5.2)×1010 erg s−1 cm−2, which is adequate to
drive chromospheric condensation at ﬂare ribbon.

After ∼09:00:40 UT, the HXR emission at 25−50 keV de-
creased to the pre-eruption level, while the emission at 12−25
keV increased gradually with episodic spikes till ∼09:02:00 UT.
To investigate the role of heat conduction in driving condensa-
tion, we estimate the energy ﬂux of heat conduction using the
expression:

Fcond = κ0

T 7/2
L

,

(3)

where κ0 ≈ 10−6 erg s−1 cm−1 K−7/2, T ≈ 14.5 MK denotes
the thermal temperature in the corona, and L ≈ πd
4 denotes the
length scale of the temperature gradient (d ≈ 36′′ represents
the equivalent diameter of circular ribbon). Fcond is estimated
to be ∼5.5×109 erg s−1 cm−2. Therefore, the condensation after
∼09:00:40 UT should be driven by a combination of nonthermal
electrons and heat conduction (Sadykov et al. 2015).

4.3. Emission mechanism of microwave burst

As mentioned above, the ﬂare was associated with type III ra-
dio bursts, which are generated by electron beams propagating
upward along open ﬁeld (Innes et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2018).
The top and middle panels of Fig. 4 show radio dynamic spec-
tra recorded by ZSTS and blen5m during 09:00−09:02 UT with
the same cadence as KRIM. Enhancement of the microwave
emission at 0.98−1.43 GHz was obviously demonstrated be-
fore 09:00:40 UT. Contrary to the discrete type III bursts ow-
ing to the coherent plasma radiation mechanism (Dulk 1985),
the microwave burst seems to be continuous and has no one-to-
one correspondence with the type III bursts, implying that the
microwave burst was not produced by plasma radiation mecha-
nism. To interpret the relationship between the HXR and radio
time proﬁles of single-loop ﬂares, Kundu et al. (2001) proposed
a simple trap model by introducing a critical pitch angle (i.e. loss
cone angle). Those injected high-energy electrons with smaller
pitch angles are not reﬂected by the increasing magnetic ﬁeld as
they approach the loop footpoints and will precipitate on their
ﬁrst approach. The remaining electrons with pitch angles out-
side the loss cone will be trapped in the loop unless pitch angle
scattering takes place.

In our case, the accelerated nonthermal electrons before
∼09:00:40 UT are composed of three groups. The ﬁrst group
propagates along open ﬁeld to generate type III radio bursts
(Fig. 4(c)). The second group precipitates straightforward into
the chromosphere and generates HXR emissions (Fig. 1(b-c)).
The third group is trapped in the rising miniﬁlament and gen-
erates microwave burst through the gyrosynchrotron emission
mechanism (Dulk 1985; Lee & Gary 2000; Wu et al. 2016). Of
course, the trapped electrons will eventually precipitate once
pitch angle scattering switches on. Existence of trapped nonther-
mal electrons in a kink-unstable ﬁlament undergoing a failed
eruption has been reported by Guo et al. (2012). After the
miniﬁlament breaks through the null point and totally opens up,
there are no trapped electrons any more and the microwave emis-
sion vanishes. This scenario is qualitative and needs to be vali-
dated by in-depth investigations. Additional cases of microwave

bursts like in Fig. 4 have been collected, which will be the topic
of our next paper.

5. Summary

In this work, a coronal jet related to a C3.4 ﬂare in AR 12434
on 2015 October 16 is studied in detail. The main results are
summarized as follows:

1. Two miniﬁlaments were located under a 3D fan-spine struc-
ture before ﬂare. The ﬂare was generated by the eruption of
one ﬁlament. The kinetic evolution of the jet was divided
into two phases: a slow rise phase at a speed of ∼130 km
s−1 and a fast rise phase at a speed of ∼360 km s−1 in the
plane-of-sky. The slow rise phase may correspond to break-
out reconnection at the breakout current sheet, and the fast
rise phase may correspond to reconnection at the ﬂare cur-
rent sheet. The transition between the two phases took place
at ∼09:00:40 UT. The blueshifted Doppler velocities of the
jet in the Si iv 1402.80 Å line range from -34 to -120 km s−1.
2. The accelerated high-energy electrons are composed of three
groups. Those propagating upward along open ﬁeld gener-
ate type III radio bursts, while those propagating downward
produce HXR emissions and drive chromospheric condensa-
tion. The electrons trapped in the rising ﬁlament generate a
microwave burst lasting for ≤40 s.

3. Bidirectional outﬂows at the jet base are manifested by sig-
niﬁcant line broadenings of the Si iv line. The blueshifted
Doppler velocities range from -13 to -101 km s−1. The red-
shifted Doppler velocities range from ∼17 to ∼170 km s−1.
Our multiwavelength observations of the ﬂare-related jet are
in favor of the breakout jet model and shed light on the ac-
celeration and transport of nonthermal electrons.
