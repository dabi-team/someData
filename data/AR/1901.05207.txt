Summary. —
Using high-resolution spectropolarimetric data acquired by IBIS, as well as
SDO/HMI observations, we studied the penumbra formation in AR NOAA 11490
and in a sample of twelve ARs appeared on the solar disk on 2011 and 2012, which
were characterized by β-type magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The results show that
the onset of the classical Evershed ﬂow occurs in a very short time scale, 1-3 hours.
Studying the formation of the ﬁrst penumbral sector around the following proto-spot,
we found that a stable penumbra forms in the area facing the opposite polarity, which
appears to be co-spatial with an AFS, i.e.
in a ﬂux emergence region, in contrast
with the results of [1] concerning the leading polarity of AR NOAA 11490. Con-
versely, analyzing the sample of twelve ARs, we noticed that there is not a preferred
location for the formation of the ﬁrst penumbral sector. We also observed before
the penumbra formation an inverse Evershed ﬂow, which changes its sign when the
penumbra appears. This conﬁrms the observational evidence that the appearance of
the penumbral ﬁlaments is correlated with the transition from the inverse Evershed
to the classical Evershed ﬂow. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the time
needed to form the penumbra may be related to the location where the penumbra
ﬁrst appears. New high-resolution observations, like those that will be provided by
the European Solar Telescope, are expected to increase our understanding of the
penumbra formation process.

1. – Introduction

Penumbra formation is a physical process which involves the coupling between plasma
and magnetic ﬁeld in the solar atmosphere. Some aspects concerning this process remain
unclear due to few available datasets of this phase of the sunspot evolution.

Recently, [1] found that the penumbra grows sector by sector, developing on the
side facing the opposite polarity of the forming active region (AR). The area between
the two polarities characterized by elongated granules associated with ﬂux emergence.
This conﬁrmed numerical simulations ([2, 3]), which also suggested that such dynamics

prevents the settlement of a stable penumbra. Moreover, [1] observed for the ﬁrst time a
line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of opposite sign with respect to that displayed by the typical
Evershed ﬂow (EF, [4]) at some azimuths around the sunspot, before the penumbra
formation.

In this contribution we report a summary of our analyses concerning the penumbra
formation ([5, 6, 7]), focusing on both the onset of the Evershed ﬂow and on the location
of the primary site where the ﬁrst stable penumbral sector appears.

2. – Observations and Data Analysis

AR NOAA 11490 was observed by the spectropolarimeter IBIS ([8]) mounted on the

Dunn Solar Telescope, in New Mexico, on 2012 May 28 and 29.

Firstly, we analyzed the proceding spot of the AR by using both photospheric (617.3 nm
line) IBIS and SDO /HMI measurements ([5]). The pore, before the penumbra formation
(Figure 1a), exhibits an annular zone where the magnetic ﬁeld is around 1 kG and has
an upside down ballerina skirt structure, as already showed in the analysis of [9, 10]. As
shown in Figure 1(b), the annular zone is characterized by downﬂows. This analysis was
focused on the transition from this inverse EF to the classical one, which occurs in 1 − 3
hours.

In the subsequent analysis ([6]), we studied the penumbra formation of the following
spot of the AR, showing that the ﬁrst penumbral sector appears on the side facing the
opposite polarity. We used the photospheric and chromospheric (854.2 nm line) IBIS
data as well as the SDO /HMI magnetograms. Elongated granules in photosphere, an
AFS in chromosphere (see Figure 1(c)) and a sea-serpent conﬁguration of the magnetic
ﬁeld are visible in the penumbra formation area.

Finally, considering twelve ARs, observed on 2011 and 2012 during the maximum
of solar cycle 24 with SDO /HMI, and classifying them according to whether the ﬁrst
penumbral ﬁlaments appear on the side away (A-type) or facing the opposite polarity
(B-type), we highlighted that there is no a preferred location for the penumbra formation
([7]). We shown four diﬀerent examples in Figure 2. The penumbra in the two spots
displayed in Figure 2(a-b) forms between the two polarities, while in the other two spots
in Figure 2(c-d) the ﬁrst penumbral sector appears in the region away the opposite
polarity.

3. – Conclusions

High resolution observations of AR NOAA 11490 indicate two diﬀerent behaviours
for the penumbra formation process. The preceding spot forms the penumbra sector by
sector, in agreement with [1], the last sector appearing on the side facing the opposite
polarity. The ﬁrst stable penumbral sector around the following spot forms along the
side between the two polarities, where elongated granules, ﬁlamentary magnetic ﬁeld in
the photosphere and an AFS in the chromosphere are visible, in contrast to the results
of [1]. The analysis of a sample of ARs shows that there is no a preferred location for the
formation of the ﬁrst penumbral sector. The time needed for the penumbra formation
may be related to the location where the ﬁrst penumbral sector appears [7].

Concerning the onset of the EF, we found that it occurs in a short time scale, 1-3 hrs.
The sample of ARs observed by SDO /HMI provides evidence that there is a correlation
between the appearance of the penumbral ﬁlaments and the transition from the inverse
to the classical EF. Independently on the type and stage of the penumbra formation, the
ﬂow changes its sign when the penumbra appears. This conﬁrms the scenario proposed
in [5].
