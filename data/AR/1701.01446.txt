ABSTRACT

Emerging ﬂux regions (EFRs) are known to exhibit various sporadic local heating events in the lower
atmosphere. To investigate the characteristics of these events, especially to link the photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds and atmospheric dynamics, we analyze Hinode, IRIS, and SDO data of a new EFR
in NOAA AR 12401. Out of 151 bright points (BPs) identiﬁed in Hinode/SOT Ca images, 29 are
overlapped by an SOT/SP scan. Seven BPs in the EFR center possess mixed-polarity magnetic
backgrounds in the photosphere. Their IRIS UV spectra (e.g., Si IV 1402.8 ˚A) are strongly enhanced
−1, which is highly suggestive of bi-directional
and red- or blue-shifted with tails reaching ±150 km s
jets, and each brightening lasts for 10 – 15 minutes leaving ﬂare-like light curves. Most of this group
show bald patches, the U-shaped photospheric magnetic loops. Another 10 BPs are found in unipolar
regions at the EFR edges. They are generally weaker in UV intensities and exhibit systematic redshifts
−1, which could exceed the local sound speed in the transition
with Doppler speeds up to 40 km s
region. Both types of BPs show signs of strong temperature increase in the low chromosphere. These
observational results support the physical picture that heating events in the EFR center are due
to magnetic reconnection within cancelling undular ﬁelds like Ellerman bombs, while the peripheral
heating events are due to shocks or strong compressions caused by fast downﬂows along the overlying
arch ﬁlament system.

1. INTRODUCTION

Apart

Magnetic ﬂux emergence and the formation of ac-
tive regions (ARs) is one of the most fascinating
phenomena of the Sun (Zwaan 1985; Cheung & Isobe
2014; Schmieder et al. 2014).
from catas-
trophic energy-releasing phenomena such as ﬂares and
CMEs (Shibata & Magara 2011) and X-ray jets ob-
served higher in the corona (Shibata et al. 1992),
a wide variety of smaller-scale events are found in
ARs. Repeated brightenings and jet ejections oc-
cur in light bridge structures (Roy 1973; Asai et al.
2001; Toriumi et al. 2015a,b), whereas jet-like features
are detected in sunspot penumbrae (Katsukawa et al.
2007; Vissers et al. 2015a).
Coupling of magnetic
ﬁelds and local convection may drive such activity
(Spruit & Scharmer 2006).

Even at the earliest stage of ﬂux emergence, various
small-scale events are observed. A commonly reported
type of small-scale events is Ellerman bombs, brighten-
ings in the Hα line wings (Ellerman 1917; see review by
Rutten et al. 2013). They have a typical size of . 1′′

with a lifetime of . 10 minutes (e.g., Georgoulis et al.
2002). As shown by radiative transfer models (e.g.,
Kitai 1983), the conﬁnement of the intensity enhance-
ment to the wings of the Hα suggests that Ellerman
bombs are heating events in the photosphere, while
high-resolution observations revealed that the Ellerman
bombs are located at the sites of magnetic reconnec-
tion in the photosphere with upright ﬂame-like struc-
tures (Watanabe et al. 2011; Vissers et al. 2013, 2015b).
Recent observations by Interface Region Imaging Spec-
trograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014) show that the
location of the UV bursts (IRIS bombs) are coincident
with locations where opposite-polarity magnetic patches
in an emerging ﬂux meet (Peter et al. 2014; Tian et al.
2016). Independently, numerical models of AR forma-
tion following ﬂux emergence point to the importance of
reconnection in opposite-polarity patches (Cheung et al.
2010). Such local heating events occur anywhere in the
EFRs with dynamic temporal variations.

Therefore, in order to reveal the nature of these events,
it is crucially important to focus on its earliest phase of

the ﬂux emergence (within a few hours from the initial
appearance), detect as many events as possible with a
wide ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) as well as suﬃcient temporal
and spatial resolutions, and analyze them in a statisti-
cal way. Furthermore, to investigate the physical con-
nection between photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and atmo-
spheric dynamics, we need simultaneous photospheric
spectropolarimetry and chromospheric and transition-
region spectrograph on the EFRs, which can only be
achieved through the coordinated observation by Hin-
ode (Kosugi et al. 2007) and IRIS.

Although this kind of observation is diﬃcult and thus
is still rare, here we report on the analysis of a data set
that satisﬁes all the afore-mentioned conditions. The
rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, in Sec-
tion 2, we describe the observations. Then, in Section 3,
we present the analysis results, which are summarized in
Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss the observed
phenomena and possible physical pictures.

2. OBSERVATIONS

The target EFR of this study appeared within the pre-
existing AR NOAA 12401. This AR had a simple bipole
structure, and the target EFR started emergence around
06:00 UT, 2015 August 19, at the center of the AR. The
magnetic ﬂux increased rapidly from around 09:00 UT,
which was captured by Hinode and IRIS (coordinated
observation). At this time, the target EFR was located
around (320′′, −270′′) on the solar disk, i.e., at an angle
of ∼ 26◦ from the disk center (DC).

The spectropolarimeter (SP; Lites et al. 2013) of the
Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT; Tsuneta et al.
2008) obtained a single raster scan from 10:35 to 11:00
UT in the Fe I lines at 6301.5 and 6302.5 ˚A. The SP
scan has a pixel size along the slit and a step size of 0.′′32
and 0.′′30, respectively, and the FOV is 113.′′5 × 122.′′9.
Also, the broadband ﬁlter imager sequentially shot the
Ca II H (3968.5 ˚A) images with a temporal gap between
08:29 and 10:34 UT. The Ca II data have a pixel size of
0.′′22 × 0.′′22, FOV of 223.′′2 × 111.′′6, and cadence of 63 s.
We applied standard procedures for prepping the SOT
data sets. The photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds were
obtained from the level 2 SP data by using MERLIN
(Lites et al. 2007) and AZAM (Lites et al. 1995).

The IRIS data were made between 07:48 and 10:54
UT. This observation sequence (OBS 3860106092) con-
sists of large sparse 64-step rasters and slit-jaw images
(SJIs). During this period, 34 raster scans were made
for C II 1334.5 and 1335.7 ˚A, Si IV 1402.8 ˚A, and Mg II
h 2803.5 and k 2796.4 ˚A, which have a step size, step
cadence, and raster cadence of 1.′′0, 5.2 s, and 330 s, re-
spectively. The pixel size is 0.′′33 along the slit and the
FOV of each scan is 63.′′9 × 118.′′8. The SJIs are com-
posed of 1330, 1400, 2796, and 2832 ˚A ﬁltergrams, each

having a pixel size of 0.′′33 × 0.′′33, FOV of 119′′ × 118′′,
and cadence of 20.6 s. We used the level 2 data, in which
the dark-current subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding, and geomet-
rical and orbital variation corrections were taken into
account1.

We also analyzed the data taken by the Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). The
photospheric evolution was monitored by the Helioseis-
mic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012;
Schou et al. 2012), while the response in the higher at-
mosphere was captured by the Atmospheric Imaging As-
sembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012). The pixel sizes for the
HMI and AIA images are 0.′′5 and 0.′′6, respectively. The
time cadence is 45 s for the HMI images and 24 s for the
AIA’s two ultraviolet images (1600 and 1700 ˚A). The
center-to-limb variation was ﬁrst subtracted from the
AIA images by applying the method in Toriumi et al.
(2014). All the observational data were co-aligned by
using the AIA images as a reference.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Overall Evolution

Figure 1 shows the overview of the target EFR in this
study: see movie for the temporal evolution. In the cen-
ter of the 30′′ × 30′′ FOV, the HMI magnetogram shows
that a number of tiny magnetic elements of positive and
negative polarities (a few arcsec) emerge at the surface
and separated each other in the northeast-southwest ori-
entation. Eventually, the magnetic elements merge to-
gether to form pores at the edges of the EFR (see the
HMI intensitygram: pore size ∼ 5′′).

At the same time, in the chromosphere, various bright-
ening events are seen in diﬀerent ﬁltergrams (1400, 1600,
and 1700 ˚A). They are located mostly in the central re-
gion with mixed magnetic polarities but also in the pe-
ripheral unipolar regions. The bright structures are seen
to be larger in 1600 and 1700 ˚A images not only because
of the large pixel sizes but also of the scattering eﬀects
(see, e.g., Rutten 2016). Other ﬁltergrams (e.g., 1330
and 2796 ˚A) exhibit similar brightening structures (not
shown).

In the map of the Mg II k absorption line core (k3),
an arch ﬁlament system (AFS) is clearly seen, which has
an area of ∼ 30′′ × 20′′ with a typical individual length
of ∼ 20′′ and a width of ∼ 2′′. The Doppler velocity
map obtained from the Si IV spectrum reveals a general
trend that the EFR center (crests of the AFS) shows
upﬂows and the peripheries (footpoints of the AFS) have
downﬂows. These observational results are consistent
with the Hα observations reported by Bruzek (1967) and

tospheric) Ni I 2799.5 ˚A line.

Bruzek (1969). The intensity of the Mg II triplet line
between Mg II h and k is enhanced at the footpoints of
the AFS.

3.2. Selection of Brightening Events

For surveying the variety of local heating events, we
identiﬁed bright points (BPs) from the SOT Ca II H im-
ages. The intensity threshold for picking up such events
is the 5σ or higher above the mean of the AIA 1700
˚A quiet-Sun values, which is suggested by Rutten et al.
(2013).

Figure 2(a) shows a scatter diagram of 1700 ˚A inten-
sity and Ca II H intensity. By ﬁtting a straight line to
this doubly logarithmic plot, we obtained the relation
between the two data sets and found that the 5σ+mean
criterion of the 1700 ˚A images, which is 4232.1 DN in
the present data set, is equivalent to 1005.1 DN in the
Ca images. We adopted this value for detecting the BPs
in the Ca images and this criterion led to a total of 151
BPs from the sequential Ca data series in the period
from 10:34 to 10:59 UT (25 frames).

Out of this 151 BPs, we found that 29 BPs were cov-
ered by the SOT SP scan. Figure 2(b) shows the dis-
tribution of the 29 BPs on the SOT SP circular po-
larization map (Stokes-V/I signal at 6301.43 ˚A), which
represents the line-of-sight (LOS) component of the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁelds. Here, the BPs have a size of
sub-arcsec to a few arcsec and are mostly seen in the
magnetized regions.

where Φ± is the total LOS ﬂux of the positive (+) or neg-
ative (−) polarities within each BP patch. If pmix = 0
the BP has either a positive or negative polarity (unipo-
lar), while pmix 6= 0 indicates that the BP has both po-
larities within the Ca intensity contour (mixed-polarity).
As a result, we found that there are seven mixed-polarity
BPs and 22 unipolar BPs.

3.3. Spectral and Polarimetric Features

The 29 Ca BPs identiﬁed in Section 3.2 are classi-
ﬁed into the following categories. The ﬁrst group is the
mixed-polarity events (seven BPs). They are distributed
mostly in the center of the target EFR. The second and
the third groups are the unipolar events in the limb-side,
i.e., the south-western end of the EFR (ﬁve BPs) and
in the DC-side, i.e., the north-eastern end (ﬁve BPs),
respectively.

There are some remaining unipolar events, which are
distributed in the EFR center (three BPs) and the plage

regions outside the EFR (nine BPs). The general trends
of these events are similar to those of the limb-side and
DC-side unipolar events.

In this section, we introduce the spectral and polari-
metric features of the mixed-polarity, limb-side unipolar,
and DC-side unipolar events with showing the represen-
tative BPs.

3.3.1. Mixed-polarity Events

The mixed-polarity BPs are basically located in the
central region of the EFR. A typical example of the
mixed-polarity event is shown in Figure 3. This ﬁgure
consists of three ﬁltergrams and a circular polarization
map of a BP located at (X, Y ) = (336′′, −274′′) in Fig-
ure 2(b) plus the IRIS spectra and SOT SP Stokes-V/I
proﬁles for the three diﬀerent locations within the BP.
Typically, in magnetized regions, Stokes-V/I has an
antisymmetric proﬁle with respect to the line center with
two lobes of opposite signs in the red and blue wings.
The three Stokes-V/I proﬁles in Figure 3 show a re-
versal of the sign, which indicates the transition of the
LOS magnetic ﬁelds between positive (colored blue) and
negative (red) polarities. At the central position of the
BP located between the opposite polarities, the purple
Stokes-V/I proﬁle shows an asymmetric, irregular shape.
Such shapes are often interpreted as a co-existence of
closely neighboring two diﬀerent magnetic components,
e.g., positive and negative polarities, within a single
pixel (Cheung et al. 2008), or as a complex stratiﬁca-
tion of magnetized atmosphere along the LOS direction.
One of the clearest characteristics of the mixed-
polarity BPs is the strong enhancements of the line in-
tensities and spectral widths. In Figure 3, the spectral
lines have their maximum intensities at location indi-
cated by the purple cross, i.e., at the BP center (see
ﬁltergrams and spectra). Among others, the peak in-
tensity of Si IV spectrum is as much as 50 times higher
than its quiet-Sun value. The purple proﬁle at the BP
center shows extended line wings of Doppler speeds of
−1. Morphologically, this BP has a size
up to ±100 km s
of about 3′′ × 3′′ with a point-like bright core.

It is noteworthy here that the Doppler shifts of the
IRIS spectra, especially of the transition-region lines
(Si IV and C II), show a positional dependence. For
example, the spectra indicated by red color, i.e., those
of the DC side of the BP, have red-shifted proﬁles, indi-
cating that the material at the transition-region temper-
ature is ﬂowing down. The Doppler velocity measured
−1. On the other
at the Si IV peak is about 20 km s
hand, the blue-colored spectra, i.e., the limb-ward ones,
are clearly blue-shifted, suggesting the upﬂow with an
−1. Similar Doppler-shift
absolute velocity of ∼ 30 km s
dependency of the location (DC-ward or limb-ward) was
recently reported by Vissers et al. (2015b).

4

Toriumi et al.

The Mg II h and k spectra often exhibit double-peaked
proﬁles with the so-called “self-absorption” cores. These
central reversals are caused by the AFS (see Mg II k3 im-
age of Figure 1), indicating that the Ca BPs are mostly
covered by the thick and dense AFS material that ex-
erts large opacity. Similarly, the C II spectra often show
central reversals, too, while the Si IV do not in this data
set.

The subordinate Mg II triplet line is sometimes seen in
emission. In Figure 3, the triplet emission is exception-
ally remarkable at the center of the BP (purple proﬁle).
According to Pereira et al. (2015), the triplet emission
is rare and indicates a steep temperature increase above
1500 K in the lower chromosphere. These features are
also reported by Vissers et al. (2015b) and Tian et al.
(2016).

The circular polarization map in Figure 3 also shows
the location of the polarity inversion lines (PILs), where
the magnetic ﬁeld has no radial component (i.e., Bz = 0)
and whether the magnetic structure at the PIL is “dip”
or “bald patch”, in which the ﬁeld lines have a concave-
up conﬁguration,

Bz = 0 and B · ∇Bz > 0,

or “top”, in which the ﬁeld lines are concave down,

Bz = 0 and B · ∇Bz < 0

(2)

(3)

(Pariat et al. 2004; Watanabe et al. 2008). Since we
have only a single-layer magnetogram, it would be better
to explicitly describe the bald patch as

Bz = 0 and Bx

∂Bz
∂x

> 0

and the counterpart as

Bz = 0 and Bx

(5)

Note that we here use the photospheric vector magnetic
ﬁelds (Bx, By, Bz), which is transformed to the local
Cartesian reference frame (x, y, z) with ˆz being the local
radial direction. It is clearly seen from the circular polar-
ization map of Figure 3 that the PIL passes through the
center of the Ca BP and that the magnetic ﬁelds have a
bald-patch conﬁguration (yellow dots). It is found that,
in ﬁve mixed-polarity BPs out of the seven total events,
the PIL is dominated by the bald patch: see Appendix
A for PILs of the six remaining mixed-polarity BPs.

3.3.2. Unipolar Events: Limb-side

Figure 4 is a typical example of the unipolar BP in
the limb-side of the target EFR. This BP is centered at
(X, Y ) = (350′′, −272′′) in Figure 2(b). This location is
one of the the south-western footpoints of the AFS (see
Figure 1) and is surrounded by a large magnetic patch
of the negative polarity. In the Stokes-V/I proﬁles, the

unipolar nature of this BP is clearly reﬂected: they do
not show a reversal or an irregular shape.

The line intensities are generally weaker than those of
the mixed-polarity events. For example, the maximum
intensities of the Si IV and C II lines in Figure 4 are
at most ﬁve times of the quiet-Sun value, as opposed to
much more than 10 times for the mixed-polarity events.
Another characteristic of the limb-side unipolar events
is that the Si IV and C II spectra coherently show red-
shifts, i.e., downﬂows. In Figure 4, the Doppler velocity
at the peak of the Si IV line reaches 30 km s

−1.

It is also interesting that the Mg II lines do not
show regular double-peaked proﬁles with central rever-
sals but single-peaked (or top-ﬂat) proﬁles. According to
Carlsson et al. (2015), such single-peaked Mg II k pro-
ﬁles are found above the plage regions and imply the
existence of hot and dense chromosphere of about 6500
In
K and a transition region at a high column mass.
fact, the single-peaked Mg II k proﬁles in this data set
are seen mostly in the vicinity of or above the devel-
oping pores. Their Doppler shifts are not remarkable
compared to those of the transition-region lines (Si IV
and C II). It should also be noted that the Mg II triplet
emission, which indicates the lower-chromospheric heat-
ing, are seen at some locations.

3.3.3. Unipolar Events: DC-side

The second group of the unipolar BPs is located in
the DC-side, i.e., the north-eastern end, of the target
EFR. Figure 5 shows the sample event around (X, Y ) =
(328′′, −266′′) in Figure 2(b).

This BP also exists at one footpoint of the AFS seen
in the Mg II k3 images (Figure 1). The Stokes-V/I sig-
nals in Figure 5 show that this BP has a positive mag-
netic polarity with no irregular proﬁles. The line inten-
sities are again weaker than those of the mixed-polarity
events. Especially in the 1400 ˚A map, the intensity en-
hancement is much less marked.

The systematic redshifts are also seen in the Si IV
and C II proﬁles. However, the redshift speeds of these
events are generally smaller than those of the limb-side
unipolar events. The maximum Doppler velocity of this
−1.
BP (Figure 5) is 15.6 km s
In Figure 5, the single-peaked Mg II k proﬁles (red and
purple) are found near the pore, which is consistent with
the limb-side unipolar events (Figure 4), while the blue
Mg II k proﬁle indicates that this location is probably
covered by the AFS. Although not clear, Figure 5 shows
an indication of a slight Mg II triplet emission.

3.3.4. Averaged Proﬁles

Figure 6 compares the proﬁles of the Si IV, Mg II, C II,
and Stokes-V/I averaged over the areas covered by the
seven mixed-polarity BPs, ﬁve limb-side unipolar BPs,

Local Heating Events in Flux Emergence

and ﬁve DC-side unipolar BPs.

The mixed-polarity events (orange) are characterized
by their enhanced and broadened proﬁles, especially of
the Si IV and C II lines. The peak intensities of the
averaged Si IV and C II lines are about 9 times of the
−1.
quiet-Sun levels, while their wings exceed ±150 km s
The Mg II k has a double-peaked proﬁle, which indi-
cates that the mixed-polarity BPs are generally located
below the ﬁbrilar canopy of the AFS. The Mg II triplet
emission is no more seen in this averaged proﬁle because
the triplet emission is rare and, if occurs, exists only in
the cores of the BPs.

The clearest feature of the limb-side unipolar events
(green solid), which shows a negative polarity in the
Stokes-V/I proﬁle, is the redshifts of the Si IV and C II
spectra. These are caused by the systematic downﬂows
at the footpoints of the AFS. The peak intensities of the
Si IV and C II lines are darker, only twice and 4 times
of their quiet-Sun values, respectively. Another obvious
characteristic is the single-peaked shape of the Mg II k
spectrum. Such a proﬁle is created probably because
these AFS footpoints are located above or very close to
the developing pores. The Mg II triplet is seen in emis-
sion, indicating the heating of the lower chromosphere.
Compared to the limb-side events, the redshifts of the
Si IV and C II lines of the DC-side, positive unipolar
events (green dashed) are not very prominent, while the
peak intensities of these lines show intermediate values
between the mixed-polarity and the limb-side unipolar:
six and eight times the quiet-Sun values. The Mg II k
has an asymmetric proﬁle with the central dip, proba-
bly caused by the mixture of the single-peaked proﬁles
near the pores and the double-peaked ones under the
AFS. Similar to the limb-side events, the Mg II triplet
emission is seen.

3.4. Temporal Evolutions

Figure 7 plots the light curves of several chromo-
spheric and transition-region lines for the three represen-
tative Ca BPs introduced in Section 3.3 (mixed-polarity,
limb-side unipolar, and DC-side unipolar events). The
light curves are obtained as time-varying intensities in-
tegrated over a 1′′ × 1′′ box, centered at the middle of
the BPs. In this ﬁgure, each light curve is normalized
by its quiet-Sun value.

For the mixed-polarity event (Figure 7 top), the light
curves show drastic enhancement around 10:45 UT with
a duration of 10 to 15 minutes. They show similar evo-
lution proﬁles with each other, a fast rise followed by an
extended decay, which is highly reminiscent of the light
curves of Hα and soft X-rays recorded in the solar ﬂares
(e.g., Kane 1974). The most signiﬁcant enhancement is
of the wavelength-integrated intensity of the Si IV line,
which increases up to almost 100 times of its quiet-Sun

level. Similar drastic Si IV enhancements of more than
10 times are seen for most of the mixed-polarity events.
Another feature to note for the mixed-polarity events
is that the intensity enhancements are often repetitive
at the same locations. For the mixed-polarity BP in
Figure 7, the preceding event occurs about 20 minutes
before the main one.

On the other hand, the light curves for both limb-side
and DC-side unipolar events are generally less marked.
The evolutions of typical events in Figure 7 (middle and
bottom) are rather steady over time, and the normalized
intensities become only a few times, at most 10 times,
of the quiet-Sun levels. The most enhanced intensities
are again of the Si IV spectra.

3.5. Statistical Trends

The statistical trends for the analyzed 29 Ca BPs are
shown in Figure 8. Here, the Ca intensities of both
types of the BPs are clearly distinct. The mixed-polarity
events are generally brighter than the unipolar ones with
the critical value being ∼ 1600 DN.

The maximum area of the Ca BPs is positively cor-
related with the intensity. Most of the mixed-polarity
events have areas ranging from 0.8×106 to 4.5×106 km2,
which is equivalent to the radii of 500 to 1200 km if
one assumes circular shapes. The unipolar BPs are
. 2×106 km2 in area, or of the radius of . 800 km. The
Ca lifetime shows, although more than half of the mea-
surements are limited by the cadence and the durations
of the Ca observation by SOT, which are 1 minute and
25 minutes, respectively, a positive relation with the Ca
intensity.

The plot for the maximum and minimum Doppler
velocities, which is obtained by simply ﬁtting a single
Gaussian function to the Si IV proﬁle, clearly shows
the diﬀerence between the two groups. While the
mixed-polarity events have a wider velocity range from
−1 (redshift), the
−32.4 km s
unipolar ones are remarkably one-sided with a range of
−1, i.e., the downﬂows (redshifts) are
−8.4 to 35.7 km s
dominated. Note that we here use the single-Gaussian
ﬁtting, which provides the Doppler velocity near the core
of the spectrum and may be aﬀected when the proﬁle
contains of more than two components.

−1 (blueshift) to 20.4 km s

The maximum intensities of the Si IV, C II, and Mg II
triplet lines also show positive relations with the Ca II
H intensity. However, the dynamic range for the Mg II
triplet is less than one order of magnitudes, 120 to 690
DN, as opposed to the wider ranges of the Si IV and
C II, 7.3 to 2000 DN and 19 to 1500 DN, respectively.

4. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have investigated various local heat-
ing events in the EFRs using the co-observation data

6

Toriumi et al.

obtained by Hinode and IRIS, complemented by SDO.
The main observational results of our study are summa-
rized as follows.

The mixed-polarity events are seen in the central part
of the EFR, which is characterized by enhanced and
broadened chromospheric and transition-region spectra.
In particular, the Si IV line brightens up signiﬁcantly
to 100 times of the quiet-Sun intensity. Sometimes the
Si IV and C II spectra spread over the Doppler speeds of
−1. The Doppler velocities at the Si IV line
±150 km s
center have a positional tendency that the redshifts of up
−1 are seen in the DC side and the blueshifts
to 20 km s
−1 are seen in the limb side within the
of up to 30 km s
BP. The Mg II k spectra often show the central rever-
sals, which is caused by the overlying AFS obscuration,
while sometimes the Mg II triplet is seen in emission, in-
dicating the lower chromospheric heating. These events
are mostly found above the PILs with the bald-patch
(i.e., U-shaped) magnetic conﬁgurations in the photo-
sphere. They are larger in size, longer in lifetime. The
light curves show ﬂare-like evolutions with durations of
10 – 15 minutes and the brightenings recur with periods
of about 20 minutes.

The unipolar events are mostly found in the peripheral
regions of the EFR, i.e., the footpoints of the AFS. These
events are weaker in intensities with the maximum Si IV
intensity being at most 10 times of the quiet-Sun level.
The Si IV spectra show systematic downﬂows with the
−1 at the line
maximum Doppler speed of ∼ 40 km s
center. The redshift velocity is generally faster for the
limb-side events than the DC-side events. If the BP is
close to or above a pore, the Mg II k spectrum reveals a
single-peaked proﬁle with no absorption core, similar to
the spectra found in the plage regions. The Mg II triplet
is seen in emission occasionally. They are smaller in size,
shorter in lifetime, and the evolution is steady.

5. DISCUSSION

The observational results summarized in Section 4
lend support to the physical picture illustrated in Fig-
ure 9. In EFRs, the magnetic ﬁelds appear at the pho-
tosphere as Ω-shaped or undular ﬁeld lines and evolve
through episodes of merging and cancellations of frag-
mentary magnetic elements. The AFS is seen above,
which may represent the ascending magnetic ﬁelds in
the higher altitudes.

The observed mixed-polarity Ca BPs may indicate
magnetic reconnection between the cancelling positive
and negative polarities, as shown in Figure 9(b). Al-
though we have no Hα observation for our events, these
BPs should be closely related to the classical Ellerman
bombs (Ellerman 1917). The striking consistencies may
be found if one compares Figure 3 of this paper and
Figure 4 of Vissers et al. (2015b), in which they show

the IRIS and Hα spectra of a textbook Ellerman bomb.
Recently, Tian et al. (2016) and Grubecka et al. (2016)
demonstrated that the Mg II h and k lines of Ellerman
bombs show intense brightening in the wings and no
signiﬁcant enhancement in the core, similar to the Hα
proﬁles. The Mg II spectra in Figure 3 agree with this
trend, which further supports that our events are likely
Ellerman bombs.

Recent high-resolution observations indicate that
the Ellerman bombs are the photospheric reconnec-
tion with ﬂame-like structures (Watanabe et al. 2011;
Vissers et al. 2013; Rutten et al. 2013). Such ﬂames
may not be resolved in our observations with a minimum
pixel size of 0.′′22 (Ca II H). Also, especially in 1700 ˚A,
they may be blurred by scattering (Rutten 2016).

The red and blueshifts observed in the mixed-polarity
BPs can be interpreted as the bi-directional jets from the
reconnection sites. The DC- and limb-ward dependence
of the Doppler velocity may be due to the viewing angle.
As the target EFR of this study is located away from the
DC by 26◦ – 27◦, the slanted viewing angle may cause
the sampling of upﬂows in the limb-side (or upper parts)
and downﬂows in the DC-side (lower parts). Perhaps
one might expect the siphon ﬂow along the small Ω-loop
for explaining the red and blueshifts. However, the dom-
inance of the bald-patch PILs for the mixed-polarity BPs
favors the U-loop cancellation theory (Georgoulis et al.
2002; Pariat et al. 2004; Watanabe et al. 2008).

The unipolar BPs at the periphery of the EFR may
be caused by the downﬂows (Figures 9(c) and (d)).
−1
Bruzek (1969) found the fast downdrafts of ∼ 50 km s
(in Hα) along the ﬁeld lines of the AFS at both foot-
points. Using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simula-
tions, Shibata et al. (1989) modeled the EFRs and sug-
gested that the bright plages near the AFS footpoints
are caused by the shocks, which is produced by the fast
−1 along the AFS entering
downﬂows of 30 to 50 km s
the high-density lower atmosphere. The above observa-
tions and simulations point to the possibility that the
unipolar BPs in the present study are also due to the
downﬂows.

If we simply assume a CHIANTI-based (i.e., coronal-
equilibrium) Si IV formation temperature of log T [K] =
4.8 – 4.9 (De Pontieu et al. 2014; Peter et al. 2014), the
−1. How-
local adiabatic sound speed is & 40 km s
ever, it is more likely that the plasma at the AFS foot-
points is denser and that the Si IV temperature is cooler
than these values. Since Rutten (2016) suggests 15, 000
to 20, 000 K for the Si IV temperature for the Eller-
man bombs (the heating of low-chromospheric to mid-
photospheric plasma), let us assume, say, 40, 000 K as
the temperature. Then, we obtain the sound speed of
−1. Therefore, there is a good chance that the
∼ 30 km s
downﬂows observed above the unipolar regions, whose

Local Heating Events in Flux Emergence

−1, are comparable to
Doppler velocity is up to 35.7 km s
or exceed the local sound speed. Although we did not
directly detect the shock fronts, considering that the
Mg II lines are not strongly Doppler-shifted (Section
3.3.2) and that the typical sound speed in the photo-
sphere is by far smaller, there may be shocks, or at least
strong compressions and condensations of the material,
which locally heat the atmosphere.

The diﬀerences of the observational characteristics be-
tween the limb-side and DC-side events, especially of
the Doppler velocities, may be due to the viewing angle:
compare Figures 9(c) and (d).

Perhaps this scenario has a relation with the transient
supersonic downﬂows and associated heating events
found above the sunspots by Kleint et al. (2014) and
Tian et al. (2014). However, their downﬂows are by far
−1, and probably are the ma-
faster, exceeding 200 km s
terial falling higher from the coronal heights such as
coronal rain, as opposed to our steady, much slower
downﬂows originated from the AFS.

heating in the unipolar regions, we cannot rule out other
possibilities such as magnetic reconnection that we
cannot resolve, or the component reconnection between
the ﬁeld lines of colliding magnetic patches of the same
polarity (see, e.g., Figure 12c of Georgoulis et al. 2002).
Therefore, it is of necessity to numerically model these
mechanisms with taking into account the radiative

transfer and examine the proposed scenarios.

respectively. All the intensities are normalized by the quiet-
Sun values. Vertical dashed lines indicate the timing of the

Three boxes show the regions corresponding to panels (b) to
(d). (b) Mixed-polarity events, where the BP may represent
the magnetic reconnection between the cancelling opposite
magnetic polarities. The ﬁeld line conﬁguration is similar to
Figure 12 of Georgoulis et al. (2002). Red and blue arrows
indicate bi-directional jets, while the green arrows present
the diﬀerent LOSs. The + and − signs show the positive
and negative polarities, respectively.
(c and d) Limb-side
and DC-side unipolar events, where the BP may be due to
the shock heating caused by the fast downﬂows along the
AFS. Orange curves represent the local heating.

APPENDIX

A. PILS OF MIXED-POLARITY EVENTS

Figure A1 summarizes the six remaining mixed-polarity events. Here, except for the two events (shown with red
arrows), the PILs are dominated by the ﬁeld lines with bald-patch conﬁgurations. Combined with the event introduced
in Section 3.3.1, one can see that ﬁve out of seven total mixed-polarity BPs (71%) reveal bald-patch PILs. The event
shown in the top middle panel of Figure A1 is separated in two patches with both “dip”-dominated and “top”-
dominated PILs (red arrows), which may also support the importance of bald-patch PILs for the mixed-polarity
events.
