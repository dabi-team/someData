two model diagnostics, Om(z) and stateﬁnder, are also applied to distinguish the two f (R)
models and ΛCDM model. Our results show that (1) The quasars sample performs very well
to place constraints on the two f (R) cosmologies, which indicates its potential to act as a
powerful complementary probe to other cosmological standard rulers. (2) The ΛCDM model,

However, there still exists some possibility that ΛCDM may not the best cosmological model

data, the information criteria indicate that the cosmological constant model is still the best
one, while the f1(R) model gets the smallest observational support. (4) The f2(R) model,
which evolves quite diﬀerent from f1(R) model at early times, still signiﬁcantly deviates from

In order to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe, which was strongly supported
by the observations of the type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) [1], a mysterious component with nega-
tive pressure was introduced as a new cosmological component dubbed as dark energy (DE).
Following this this direction, based on the cosmological principles (homogeneous, isotropic)
and Einstein’s general relativity (GR), the current standard cosmological model considers
the cosmological constant (Λ) corresponding to a modiﬁcation of the energy-momentum ten-
sor in Einstein equations, which is generally consistent with most of the observational data
including SN Ia, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [2], the baryon acoustic oscil-
lations (BAO) [3], etc. However, considering the fact that ΛCDM is still confronted with
the well-known coincidence problem and ﬁne-tuning problem, a large number of dark energy
models have been proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration [4–6]. On the other hand,
without introducing the new component in the universe, the modiﬁcation of general relativ-
ity provides another way to go. Some popular theories of modifying GR include f (R) theory
of gravity [7, 8], f (T ) gravity [9–11], Gauss-Bonnet and f (G) gravity [12]. In this paper,
we focus on the so-called f (R) gravity, the advantage of which not only lies in its ability to
explain the late-time cosmic acceleration of the universe, but also describe the large scale
structure distribution of the Universe [13, 14]. In the framework of f (R) theories of gravity,
the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian can be modiﬁed by changing the Ricci scalar R to f (R), a
diﬀerentiable function of R, on the base of which the generalized ﬁeld equation is derived by
varying the action with respect to the metric. However, since this method always leads to
fourth-order equations along with some instability problems in many interesting cases [15],

– 1 –

we consider in our analysis a diﬀerent method called Palatini approach [7, 8], which takes
the metric and the connection as two independent ﬁeld variables in the action, and varies the
action respectively with the two variables to obtain the generalized Einstein ﬁeld equation.
From the observational point of view, it is also very important to explore such f (R)
cosmological models in light of observational data, which has been broadly studied in the
literature [16–18]. There are two direct standard probes of expansion history of the Universe,
one is the standard candles providing the information of luminosity distance (DL(z)), and the
other is the standard rulers related to the so-called angular diameter distance (DA(z)). For
instance, BAO and CMB peak locations are respectively recognized as the standard rulers
[19–21], and the increasing observations of these two distance indicators have been widely used
in various cosmological studies. Other most commonly used standard rulers in cosmology
also include the strongly gravitationally lensed systems [22–26], the x-ray gas mass fraction
of galaxy clusters [27], etc. In this paper we investigate the constraints on the f (R) gravity
from the latest measurement of angle diameter distance from the recently-released VLBI
observations of the compact structure in intermediate-luminosity quasars [28, 29] combined
with the angular-diameter-distance measurements from galaxy clusters [30], which consists
of 145 data points performing as individual cosmological standard rulers in the redshift range
2.80. Compared with other standard rulers extensively used in the literature
0.023
(BAO, strong lensing systems), quasars (QSO) are observed at much higher redshits (z
3.0),
which indicates their potential to test the f (R) theory with the newly revised observations.
Previous papers have demonstrated the success of this sample in its cosmological application.
In Paper I [28], we demonstrated the existence of dark energy in the Universe with high
signiﬁcance and estimated the speed of light referring to a distant past (z = 1.70).
In
Paper II and III [29, 31], we investigated the cosmological application of this data set and
obtained stringent constraints on the parameters in various dark energy models and f (T )
gravity models. More speciﬁcally, in this paper we try to give a new approach to constraining
two viable f (R) models within the Palatini formalism: f1(R) = R

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy describe the basic theory
of f (R) gravity as well as the corresponding cosmological models. In Section 3, we describe
the methodology and observational samples for angular diameter distances.
In Section 4,
we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, and furthermore apply model
diagnostics in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are summarized in Section 6. The units
with constant speed of light c = 1 is used throughout this work.

2 The f (R) gravity in the metric formalism

In this section we ﬁrstly derive the modiﬁed Einstein ﬁeld equations in f (R) theory as well
as the new Friedman equation in f (R) cosmology, and then brieﬂy introduce the two f (R)
models in Palatini formalism to be considered in this paper.

In Palatini formalism, the modiﬁed Einstein-Hilbert action in the framework of f (R)

gravity is given by

where κ = 8πG, g is the determinant of the metric gµν , f is a diﬀerentiable function of the
Ricci scalar R, and SM is the action of matter depending on the matter ﬁeld ψ and the metric
gµν . It should be noted that the metric gµν and the aﬃne connection ˆΓρ
µν are treated as two
independent ﬁelds for the gravity action in Palatini formalism. From the aﬃne connection
ˆΓρ
µν, the expression of the generalized Ricci tensor can be written as

and the Ricci scalar is dependent on the metric and the aﬃne connection as R = gµν ˆRµν .
Varying the action (2.1) with respect to the connection ˆΓ yields the equation

where f ′(R)

conformal with the original metric gµν , the aﬃne connection ˆΓ can be written as the usual
Levi-Civita connection of the new metric hµν

ˆΓλ

From the discussion above, one can see that varying the action (2.1) with respect to

As the most commonly used parametrization in f (R), the ﬁrst model has been tested with

from the well-known Hu & Sawicki model [43], f (R) = R
1+c2(R/m2)n . Considering that
n is an integer satisfying n > 0.9, for simplicity we have set n = 1 and thus a = m2c1/c2 and
b = 1/c1 in this work. In the two f (R) models, one can easily ﬁnd that

which is equivalent to the ΛCDM model: f (R) = R
constant. Therefore, there are two independent model parameters (a, b) in the two f (R)
models, both of which can reduce to ΛCDM when b
0. We note that b can be regarded as
the deviation parameter quantifying the deviation of f (R) gravity from ΛCDM. Moreover,
for a speciﬁc f (R) model with certain value of a and b, the combination of Eq. (2.12) and
(2.9) will provide the matter density parameter Ωm, which is deﬁned as Ωm = κρm0/(3H 2
0 ).
Therefore, constraint results on the f (R) models can be shown in the (a, b) or (Ωm, b) plane,
which will be speciﬁcally presented in section 4.

3 Observational data and ﬁtting method

3.1 Quasars and galaxy clusters

It has been a long-time controversy that whether compact structure in radio sources could
provide a new type of standard ruler in the universe [44–47]. Recently, based on a 2.29 GHz
VLBI all-sky survey of 613 milliarcsecond ultra-compact radio sources [48, 49], Cao et al. [28]
presented a method to divide the full sample into diﬀerent sub-samples, according to their
optical counterparts and intrinsic luminosity. The ﬁnal results indicated that intermediate-
luminosity quasars show negligible dependence on both redshifts z and intrinsic luminosity
L, and thus represent a ﬁxed comoving-length of standard ruler. More recently, based on
a cosmological-model-independent method to calibrate the linear sizes lm of intermediate-
luminosity quasars, Cao et al. [29] investigated the cosmological application of this data set
and obtained stringent constraints on both the matter density parameter Ωm and the Hubble
constant H0, which agree well with the recent Planck results. The constraining power of the
quasar data was also studied in viable f (T ) gravity models, where T is the torsion scalar in
teleparallel gravity [31].

In our analysis, we will use the observations of 120 intermediate-level quasars covering
the redshift range 0.46 < z < 2.80, while the linear size of this standard ruler is calibrated
0.25 pc by a new cosmological-independent technique (see Cao et al. [29] for
to lm = 11.03
details and reference to the source papers). The observable in this data set is the angular
size of the compact structure in radio quasars, the theoretical counterpart of which expresses
as

±

θ(z) =

lm
DA(z)

(3.1)

where DA is the angular diameter distance at redshift z (Eq.(2.14)). In this work minimize
the χ2 objective function to derive model parameters of the f (R) theory:

QSO(z; p) =

σθ(zi)2

,

(3.2)

where p represents the model parameters in f (R) gravity, and θth(zi; p) is the theoretical
value of the angular size at redshift zi, while θobs(zi) and σθ(zi) are the observed value and
the corresponding 1σ uncertainty of angular size for each quasar, respectively. Moreover, we
have considered the intrinsic spread in linear sizes lm by adding 10% systematical uncertainty
in the observed angular sizes in computing. One should note that, in the framework of
χ2 minimization method, the additional 10% uncertainties in the observed angular sizes is
equivalent to adding an additional 10% uncertainty in the linear size, although the best-ﬁt
parameters describing the dependence of lm on the luminosity and redshift are negligibly
small [28, 29].

Moreover, the observations from Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀect (SZE) and X-ray surface
brightness from galaxy clusters also oﬀer a source of angular diameter distances. Considering
the redshift range of quasar sample used in our analysis, i.e., the lack of low-redshift quasars
at z < 0.5, we also consider 25 galaxy clusters covering the redshift range 0.023
0.784
from De Filippis et al. (2005) sample [50], in which a isothermal elliptical β model was used
to describe the clusters by combining their SZE and X-ray surface brightness observations.
As previously noted by Ref. [29], due to the the redshift coverage of high-redshift quasars
and low-redshift clusters, the combination of these two astrophysical probes could contribute

a relatively complete source of angular diameter distances. The observable in this data is the
angular diameter distance DA,obs, the theoretical counterpart DA,th is deﬁned in Eq. (2.14).
Similar to the quasars data, the χ2 function for the galaxy cluster data is given by

3.2 BAO and CMB data

Besides the individual standard rulers, observations the other two standard rulers that we
shall use in this paper for the joint cosmological analysis are the BAO and CMB data.

For CMB, we use the measurement of the shift parameter

, which is sensitive to the
distance to the decoupling epoch corresponding to the overall amplitude of the acoustic peaks.

For BAO, we turn to the latest observations of acoustic-scale distances from the 6-degree
Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) at lower redshift z = 0.106 [53], the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS-DR7) catalog combined with galaxies from 2dFGRS (at eﬀective redshift z = 0.2 and
z = 0.3) [54], while the higher-z measurement is derived from the WiggleZ galaxy survey,
which reported distances in three correlated redshift bins between 0.44 and 0.73 [55]. More
speciﬁcally, we use the measurement of distance ratio
(zBAO) = dA(z∗)/DV (zBAO) from the
BAO peak to set constraint on f (R) model parameters, where DV is the dilation scale and
dA is the co-moving angular diameter distance (diﬀerent from the angular diameter distance
DA). The expressions of the two types of distances respectively read

In this section, we present the constraint results of two f (R) models by using diﬀerent angular
diameter distance data, QSO+Cluster (individual standard rulers), BAO+CMB (statistical
standard rulers), and QSO+Cluster+BAO+CMB (combined standard rulers). The likelihood
contours with 1σ and 2σ conﬁdence levels for each f (R) model are presented in Fig. 1 and 2,
in which the left and right panels respectively illustrate the results on the (a, b) and (Ωm, b)
planes.

For the individual standard ruler data (QSO+Cluster), the best-ﬁt values of the parame-
ters in the f1(R) model are (a, b) = (16.321, 0.715) or (Ωm, b) = (0.417, 0.715). For com-
parison, ﬁtting results from BAO and CMB are also shown in Fig. 1. We remark that,
although the QSO+Cluster data can not tightly constrain the model parameters, the de-
generacy between Ωm and b obtained from these individual standard rulers is diﬀerent from
the statistical standard rulers (BAO and CMB). Therefore, the quasar data, due to the
wide redshift range of 0.46 < z < 2.80, have the potential to help break the degener-
acy between model parameters in f1(R) cosmology. This tendency could also be clearly
seen from the comparison between the plots obtained with BAO+CMB and the joint an-
gular diameter distance data of QSO+Cluster+BAO+CMB. With the combined standard
ruler data sets, the best-ﬁt value for the parameters are (a, b) = (4.669+0.842
−0.061) or
(Ωm, b) = (0.286+0.018
−0.064) within 68.3% conﬁdence level, while the constraint results
from BAO+CMB are (a, b) = (4.349+1.343
−0.108).
Therefore, the currently compiled quasar data may signiﬁcantly improve the model parame-
ters in f1(R) cosmology.

ever, in the framework of exponential f (R) gravity, the parameter b capturing the deviation

that there still exists some possibility that ΛCDM may not the best cosmological model
preferred by the current observations. In order to make a good comparison with this stan-

Working on the f2(R) model, we ﬁnd that the best ﬁts happen at (a, b) = (3.046,
or (Ωm, b) = (0.340,
0.718) with individual standard ruler data (QSO+Cluster). By
marginalizing over the parameter a, we derive the marginalized 1σ constraint on the mat-
ter density parameter Ωm = 0.340, which is well consistent with the result given by re-
cent Planck ﬁrst data release. The constraining power of the individual standard rulers
in breaking degeneracy between model parameters is more obvious, as can be seen from
the the marginalized 1σ and 2σ contours of each parameter in Fig. 2. By ﬁtting the f2(R)
model model to QSO+Cluster+BAO+CMB, we obtain (a, b) = (4.048+0.261
−0.189) or
−0.281,
(Ωm, b) = (0.287+0.017
−0.196) at the 68.3% conﬁdence level. Compared with the case
−0.016,
in the f1(R) model, the largest diﬀerence happens on the constraint of b: the deviation from
ΛCDM tends to be slightly smaller than 0, although the concordance cosmological scenario
is still included within 68.3% conﬁdence level. In order to compare our ﬁts with the results
obtained using the standard candles providing the information of luminosity distance, we
also use the latest Union2.1 compilation consisting of 580 SN Ia data [57] to place constraint
on the f2(R) model, which are speciﬁcally presented in Table IV. One can clearly see that,
due to the wider redshift range of the quasars data (0.46 < z < 2.80) compared with SN
Ia (0.015 < z < 1, 41), the current standard ruler data make a good improvement on the
constraints of the f2(R) model parameters. The recent determinations of the parameters a
and b from other independent cosmological observations are also listed in Table IV.

4.3 Model selection

Based on a likelihood method, one may employ the information criteria (IC) to assess diﬀerent
models. In order to decide which f (R) model is favored by the observational data, we perform
model comparison statistics by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [32] and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [33]. The expressions of the two information criteria
are respectively given by

AIC =

and

−

2ln

BIC =

Lmax + klnN = χ2

(4.2)
min is the minimum χ2 value, while k and N represent the total number of model
where χ2
parameters and data points. As can be clearly seen from the two information criteria, mod-
els that give a good ﬁt with fewer parameters will be more favored by observations. The
application of the BIC and AIC in a cosmological context can be found in the previous study
[24, 58].

min + klnN

In this analysis, we use the the combined standard ruler data (quasars, galaxy clusters,
BAO and CMB) for the purpose of model selection. Table V lists the value of the minimum
χ2, AIC, BIC and the corresponding IC diﬀerence of each model (f1(R), f2(R) and ΛCDM).
Note that the cosmological constant model has the lowest value of IC and the value of ∆IC is
measured with respect to this model. One will ﬁnd that, given the current individual standard
ruler data combined with the BAO and CMB data, the information criteria indicate that the
cosmological constant model is still the best one, since both the AIC and BIC values it yields
are the smallest. Concerning the ranking of the two f (R) models, AIC and BIC criteria give
very similar conclusions, which indicate that f2(R) is slight favored, while the f1(R) model
gets the smallest support from the current observations. More speciﬁcally, considering the
fact that a diﬀerence in BIC (∆BIC) of 2 is positive evidence against the model with higher
BIC [33], our ﬁndings show that f (R) cosmologies with more free parameters are penalized
by the BIC criterion. This conclusion is in accordance with the previous results derived from
other cosmological probes [24, 59].

In order to gain more insights into the above ﬁndings, in the following analysis we will
turn to other sensitive and robust diagnostics to illustrate the dynamic behavior of diﬀerent
cosmologies. The corresponding results are obtained based on the best ﬁts from the joint
analysis of standard ruler data.

where a is the scale factor. These quantities were ﬁrst propose to test both the evolution
of cosmology (i.e., the determination of transition redshift (deceleration/acceleration), which
has been proved to provide an eﬃcient way for constraining cosmological models [60]), and
then extensively applied to the investigation of the dynamical properties of dark energy (i.e.,
the possible interaction between cosmic dark sectors [61, 62]). In this section, we will perform
two diagnostics analysis based on the above two quantities, i.e., the Om(z) diagnositc and
the stateﬁnder diagnostic, to discuss the possibility of discriminating the three cosmological
models (f1(R), f2(R) and ΛCDM).

5.1 Om(z) diagnostic

The expansion rates at diﬀerent redshifts, or the Hubble parameters H(z), opened a new
chapter in using the so called Om(z) diagnostics to discriminate diﬀerent cosmological models
as well as ΛCDM model [34]. In this method, a new diagnostics is deﬁned as

Om(z) =

E2(z)

value of matter density Om(z) = Ωm, if the cosmological model of our universe is exactly the

– 11 –

ΛCDM model. Therefore, such diagnostic can be used as a cosmological probe to directly
illustrate the diﬀerence between ΛCDM and other cosmological models.

Fig. 3 shows the Om(z) parameter as a function of redshift for the two f (R) models,
with the best-ﬁtted value as well as the 1σ uncertainties derived from the combined standard
ruler data. It is obvious that the Om(z) curves of the two f (R) models will coincide with
ΛCDM at high redshifts (z > 3), which indicates that the Om(z) for the f (R) models cannot
be distinguished ΛCDM at early universe. The f (R) cosmology begins to deviate from the
ΛCDM at the redshift interval of 1.5 < z < 3, although we still cannot distinguish the two
f (R) models at this epoch. At redshifts z < 1, the two f (R) models begin to deviate with
each other: for f1(R) model, the value of Om(z) is always smaller than that in ΛCDM model,
while the deviation between f1(R) and ΛCDM gradually increase, which implies a smaller
Om(z) in the future; for f2(R) model, the other cosmological candidate proposed without
introducing dark energy in the Universe, the value of Om(z) is also smaller than Ωm when
the deviation from ΛCDM model takes place, which will increase and exceed Ωm at lower
redshifts.

5.2 Stateﬁnder diagnostic

As can be clearly seen from Eq. (5.1), the Hubble parameter H and the deceleration parameter
q are respectively related to ˙a and ¨a. Considering that H and q cannot eﬀectively diﬀerentiate
between diﬀerent cosmological models, a joint analysis still requires a new parameter related
to the higher order of time derivatives of a. In the so-called stateﬁnder diagnostic [35], the
stateﬁnder pair

is deﬁned as

f (R) models in the r

stateﬁnder parameters r and s for ΛCDM model are constants, (r, s) = (1, 0) [63].

which indicates that the parameter r is more suitable to discriminate diﬀerent cosmological

models. As can be clearly seen from Fig. 4, the curve of each cosmological model originates
from the same point (r, q) = (1, 0.5), evolves along diﬀerent trajectory, and ﬁnally converges
on the same point (r, q) = (1,
1). For f1(R), the deviation from ΛCDM is not as obvious as
that between f2(R) and ΛCDM, while the trajectory of f1(R) converges with ΛCDM earlier
than f2(R). At the present epoch, the parameters (r, q) for f1(R) and ΛCDM cannot be
distinguished from each other, while the value of r for f2(R) is lager than that of the other
two models. More interestingly, it is noteworthy that for f2(R) cosmology, we observe the
signature ﬂip from negative to positive in the value of r in the early universe, which indicates
that the f2(R) model is quite diﬀerent from f1(R) model and ΛCDM model at early times.
The evolution of stateﬁnder pair (r, s) for diﬀerent cosmological models are plotted
in Fig. 5, in which the yellow square at (r, s) = (0, 1) indicates the stateﬁnder of ΛCDM
model. It is apparent that the stateﬁnder pair of f2(R) evolves quite diﬀerent from that in
the framework of f1(R)CDM model. More importantly, as is shown in Fig. 5, the current
value of (r, q) for f1(R) is well consistent with ΛCDM, while the corresponding value for
f2(R) signiﬁcantly deviates from both of them at the present epoch. Therefore, although the
stateﬁnder pair (r, q) cannot distinguish f1(R) model and ΛCDM model from each other at
the present time, it is able to distinguish the f2(R) from both f 1CDM and ΛCDM. However,
the f (R) cosmologies are not distinguishable and can not be distinguished from ΛCDM in
the near future.

As a ﬁnal comment, one should note that the combination of standard ruler data im-
plies that, the two modiﬁed gravity models discussed in this analysis are still practically
indistinguishable from ΛCDM. Such a tendency is more obvious when the 1σ uncertainty
of the model parameters is taken into consideration (See Figs. 3-5). Therefore, the above
conclusions still need to be checked by future high-precision VLBI observations of the com-
pact structure in radio quasars [64, 65], which also highlights the importance of diﬀerent
cosmological standard rulers to provide additional observational ﬁts on alternative candidate
gravity theories.

6 Conclusions and discussions

As an important candidate gravity theory alternative to dark energy, a class of f (R) modiﬁed
gravity, which introduces a perturbation of the Ricci scalar R in the Einstein-Hilbert action,
has been extensively applied to cosmology to explain the acceleration of the universe. On
the other hand, recent observations of various cosmological standard rulers acting as distance
indicators in the Universe, have provided a lot of information concerning angular diameter
distance DA. In this paper, we focused on the recently-released VLBI observations of the
compact structure in intermediate-luminosity quasars combined with the angular-diameter-
distance measurements from galaxy clusters, which consists of 145 data points performing as
individual cosmological standard rulers in the redshift range 0.023
2.80, to investigate
observational constraints on two viable models in f (R) theories within the Palatini formalism:

degeneracy between model parameters in f (R) cosmology. More speciﬁcally, one can
clearly see that, due to the wider redshift range of the quasars data (0.46 < z < 2.80)
compared with SN Ia (0.015 < z < 1.41), the current standard ruler data make a good
improvement on the constraints of the f2(R) model parameters.

From the joint analysis of combined standard ruler data, the matter density parameter

•

– 14 –

Ωm derived from the combined standard ruler data in the f1(R) and f2(R) model are
both close to 0.30, which is consistent with that from other independent cosmological
observations. Moreover, with the assumption of a ﬂat universe and given the current
quality of the observational data, the ΛCDM model is still included within 68.3%
conﬁdence level and there is no reason to prefer any more complex model. Given the
current individual standard ruler data combined with the BAO and CMB data, the
information criteria imply that the cosmological constant model is still the best one,
while the f1(R) model gets the smallest support from the current observations.

Deviation from ΛCDM cosmology is also detected in the obtained conﬁdence level in our
analysis. More speciﬁcally, in the framework of exponential f1(R) gravity, the deviation
parameter b denoting the diﬀerence between f (R) gravity and the concordance ΛCDM
model seems to be slightly larger than 0, while for f2(R) gravity, the largest diﬀerence
happens on the constraint of b, i.e., the deviation from ΛCDM tends to be slightly
smaller than 0. Therefore, there still exists some possibility that ΛCDM may not the
best cosmological model preferred by the current observations. However, this conclusion
still needs to be checked and conﬁrmed by future more accurate observational data.

Applying the best-ﬁts from combined standard ruler data to two model diagnostics,
Om(z) and stateﬁnder, we have applied two model diagnostics to diﬀerentiate the
dynamical behavior of the f (R) models. The results from the Om(z) diagnostic show
that the Om(z) for the f (R) models cannot be distinguished ΛCDM at early universe.
As the redshift decreases, the f (R) cosmology begins to deviate from the ΛCDM at the
redshift interval of 1.5 < z < 3. On the other hand, the stateﬁnder diagnostic indicates
that in the early universe f2(R) evolves quite diﬀerent from that in the framework of
f1(R) model, both of which will ﬁnally evolve to the same state. At the present time,
f1(R) model is well consistent with ΛCDM model, while f2(R) model still signiﬁcantly
deviates from both f1(R) and ΛCDM model. However, when the 1σ uncertainty of the
model parameters is taken into consideration, these two modiﬁed gravity models are
still practically indistinguishable from ΛCDM.

Given the redshift coverage of high-redshift quasars and low-redshift clusters, the com-
bination of these two astrophysical probes could provide a relatively complete source of
angular diameter distances. From the perspective of observations, the recently released
quasar data propose a new way to probe the cosmology. Furthermore, the quasar data
used in this paper were observed at single frequency, we expect the future high-precision
observations derived at multi frequencies [64, 65] to provide more information of other
classes of modiﬁed gravity theories. From the theoretical point of view, besides the
two f (R) models which we have already extensively investigated in this paper, some
other typical examples are Lorentz violating theories [66], ghost condensation [67], and
tensor-vector-scalar theory of gravity [68].
