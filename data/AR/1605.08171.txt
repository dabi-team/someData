Abstract

The Coulomb displacement energies of the neutron-rich Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs with

mass number A = 35 − 47 are calculated within the relativistic mean ﬁeld model and the eﬀects

of level inversion on the Coulomb displacement energies of the Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs

are studied. The calculations are carried out in two cases, with and without consideration of

the possible 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 proton level inversion of the neutron-rich Ar isotopes. Results show
that the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion of the neutron-rich Ar isotopes may reduce the Coulomb

displacement energy by 0.06∼0.17 MeV for the Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs. The results may

provide a reference for experimental investigations of nuclear level inversion and a new test of the

relativistic mean ﬁeld model.

Keywords: Coulomb displacement energy; level inversion; relativistic mean ﬁeld model; Ar

isotopes.

One of the long debated problem in nuclear physics is the existence of the level inversion

and the relevant nuclear phenomena in exotic nuclei [1, 2]. The problem of nuclear level

inversion has been studied with a variety of nuclear models and much progress has been

achieved [3–12]. However, there are still many problems remaining unresolved; for instance,

what are the real causes for the nuclear level inversion? In a recently published paper [13],

we studied the possible proton 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion of the neutron-rich Ar isotopes

within the relativistic mean ﬁeld model [14–21] and investigated the possibility to probe the

level inversion using elastic electron-nucleus scattering. In addition to electron scattering,

nuclear level inversion may also lead to other physical eﬀects.

It may, for instance, lead

to the change of the Coulomb displacement energy [22–24] since the Coulomb displacement

energies between isobaric analog states are due to isospin non-conserving forces, such as the

Coulomb interaction between protons. Therefore, we would like to seek another possible

way to detect the nuclear level inversion by investigating the eﬀects of proton level inversion

on the Coulomb displacement energies of the Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs.

In the present paper, we report our calculations of Coulomb displacement energy shifts

brought about by the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 proton level inversion of the neutron-rich Ar isotopes.

Suggested by professor W. Mittig, we performed calculations on the Coulomb displacement

energies of some neutron-rich Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs with A = 35 − 47 within

the relativistic mean ﬁeld model with the NL-SH [20] and TM1/TM2 [21] parameters. The

calculations were carried out in two cases: with and without consideration of the possible

2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion of the neutron-rich Ar isotopes. The results show that the 2s1/2

and 1d3/2 level inversion may lead to a noticeable reduction of the Coulomb displacement

energy, and this may provide a reference for experimental investigations of nuclear level

inversion. In addition, the results may also provide a new test of the relativistic mean ﬁeld

theory.

I. DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD

Based on the formula

∆EC =

e
2T Z

ρexc(r)Vcore(r)d3r

(1)

2

given in Ref.

[24], where Vcore(r) is the Coulomb potential produced by the core protons
and ρexc(r) is the distribution of the N − Z excess neutrons, the Coulomb displacement

energies between the isobaric analog states and the respective nuclear ground states can be

evaluated. We ﬁrst carried out calculations on some arbitrarily chosen isobaric state pairs

with mass number ranging from A = 27 to A = 65 to test the formula and the codes, and

then performed calculations on neutron-rich Ar-K isobaric state pairs with mass number

ranging from A = 35 to A = 47.

In the calculation, the Coulomb potential ﬁeld Vcore(r) produced by the core protons and
the distribution ρexc(r) of the N − Z excess neutrons are evaluated using one of the paired

nuclei with the smaller proton number Z<. For instance, for the Ar-K pair with A = 46,

the Coulomb potential ﬁeld Vcore(r) is generated by the 18 core protons of Ar, that is, the

16 protons in 1s1/2, 2p1/2, 2p3/2, 1d5/2, 2s1/2 orbitals and the 2 protons in the 1d3/2 orbital;
the excess neutron distribution ρexc(r) is given by the N − Z = 10 neutrons with 2 of

them in 1d3/2 (or 2s1/2) orbital and 8 in 1f7/2 and higher orbitals. The Coulomb potential

ﬁeld Vcore(r) and the excess neutron distribution ρexc(r) are both calculated using the single

particle wave functions produced with the relativistic mean ﬁeld model. For comparison and

mutual veriﬁcation, two sets of force parameters, the NL-SH [20] and TM1/TM2 parameters

[21], are used, with TM1 used for the isobaric analog state pairs with A > 40 and TM2 for

those with A ≤ 40.

II. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. The arbitrarily chosen isobaric analog state pairs with A = 27 − 65

To guarantee the validity of our calculation, we ﬁrst test the method and the codes.

We have arbitrarily chosen some isobaric analog state pairs for the test.

In Table 1, we

tabulate the calculated results and the experimental ones from Ref.

[22], as well as the

deviations along with some statistical results. The ﬁrst and second columns of Table 1 are

the mass numbers and corresponding speciﬁc isobaric analog state pairs that are chosen

and calculated. The mass number ranges from A = 27 to A = 65. The numbers in the

brackets of the second column are the isospin values [22]. The symbol △EC in the third
column denotes the experimental Coulomb displacement energies [22]; the symbols △E1

C in

3

the fourth column and △E2

C in the ﬁfth column denote the calculated results of the Coulomb

TABLE I: The ﬁrst column is the mass numbers of the isobaric pairs. The third column is the

experimental Coulomb displacement energies [22], and the fourth and ﬁfth columns are the cal-

culated results with the NL-SH and TM1/TM2 parameters ( with TM1 parameters for the pairs

with A > 40 and TM2 parameters for the pairs with A ≤ 40 ). Columns six to nine are the devi-

ations between the calculated results and the experimental ones. The last column is the renewed

experimental data. The last three rows are the mean, minimum and maximum deviations.

six and seven are the absolute and relative deviations of the calculated values with NL-SH

parameters with respect to the experimental values. Columns eight and nine are the same as

columns six and seven but for the results calculated with TM1/TM2 parameters. In Table

1, the experimental data for the 56Mn-56Fe and 65Ni-65Cu pairs were obtained with both 56Fe

and 65Cu in the excited states [22]; for the other isobaric state pairs, the experimental data

4

were obtained with the paired nuclei both in the ground states [22]. The last three rows

in Table 1 are the mean, minimum and maximum deviations, respectively. For intuitive

comparison, the results are also shown in Fig. 1.

the ﬁlled triangles, the results with the TM1/TM2 parameters.

The experimental results of Ref.

[22] were obtained based on a relatively old atomic

nuclear mass data table given by Audi and Wapstra in 1995 [25]. To compare the present

results with up-to-date experimental data, we renewed the experimental results based on

the most recent atomic nuclear mass data given by Audi and Wapstra in 2012 [26]. The

renewed experimental data are evaluated with the same formula [22],

∆EC = MZ> − MZ< + ∆nH,

(2)

as is used in Ref. [22], where MZ> is the mass of the higher Z member nucleus of an analog
pair and MZ< is the mass of the lower Z member nucleus, and ∆nH is the neutron-hydrogen
mass diﬀerence of 0.782354 MeV. The renewed data are listed in the last column of Table 1

and the comparison with the calculated results is shown in Fig. 2.

Table 1, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show that the calculated Coulomb displacement energies

are in good agreement with the experimental data. It is seen from Table 1 that the largest

deviation of the results obtained with NL-SH parameters is less than 0.17 MeV and the mean

deviation is less than 0.069 MeV; the corresponding relative deviations are 2.40% and 0.91%,

respectively. For the results obtained with TM1/TM2 parameters, the largest absolute

deviation is less than 0.31 MeV and the mean deviation is 0.11 MeV; the corresponding

relative deviations are 4.94% and 1.46%. For the renewed data, it can also be easily obtained

from Table 1 that the largest deviation of the results obtained with NL-SH parameters is less

than 0.20 MeV and the mean deviation is less than 0.072 MeV; the corresponding relative

deviations are 2.42% and 0.94%, respectively. For the results obtained with TM1/TM2

parameters, the largest absolute deviation is less than 0.31 MeV and the mean deviation is

0.12 MeV; the corresponding relative deviations are 4.98% and 1.47%. The experimental

data are very well reproduced by the relativistic mean ﬁeld model with the NL-SH and

TM1/TM2 parameters. It is also found from Table 1 that the diﬀerence is very small (no

more than 0.06 MeV) between the renewed data and the data of Ref. [22].

B. The Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs

The Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs, which may be of some interests to the experimen-

talists, are calculated and discussed. The mass number of the chosen isobaric analog pairs

ranges from A = 35 to A = 47.

6

 
 
Calculations of the Ar isotopes within the relativistic mean ﬁeld model show that there

may exist the proton 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion for the Ar isotopes with A > 36 [13].

Since the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion in Ar isotopes will change the distribution of the

N −Z excess neutrons, we calculated the Coulomb displacement energies of the Ar-K isobaric

analog state pairs in two cases. In one case (Case 1), the level inversion is neglected and two

of the N − Z excess neutrons are assumed to occupy the 1d3/2 orbital and the others occupy

the 1f7/2 and higher level orbitals; in another case (Case 2), the level inversion is taken into
account and two of the N − Z excess neutrons are assumed to be in the 2s1/2 orbital and

the others in the 1f7/2 and higher level orbitals. As has been shown that the renewed data

only show very slight diﬀerence from the experimental results given in Ref. [22], so we will

not give the renewed data in the following calculations for the Ar-K isobaric analog state

pairs.

1. Case 1

In this case, the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion for the Ar isotopes with A > 36 is not
considered, i.e., the distribution ρexc(r) of the N − Z excess neutrons are evaluated with two
of the N − Z excess neutrons in the 1d3/2 orbital and the others in the 1f7/2 and higher level

orbitals. The results are listed in Table 2.

In Table 2, the experimental data are from Ref. [22]; the experimental result of 37Ar-37K

was obtained with 37Ar and 37K both in the ground states; the others were obtained with

either Ar or K nucleus in the excited states, or both of them in the excited states. The last

row in Table 2 is the results of the 47Ar-47K pair, whose experimental data are unavailable.

The results are also plotted in Fig. 3, with panel (a) plotted on the same scale as Fig. 1

for comparison and panel (b) on a smaller scale to show some details for discussion and

comparison. The plots show that the general trends of variation of the calculated results

with the two sets of parameters are very similar to that of the experimental data.

However, on a smaller scale it is seen from panel (b) that in this case the TM1/TM2

parameters produce better results for Ar-K pairs than the NL-SH parameters, especially for

those near the stability line. The results obtained with the NL-SH parameters are generally

a little larger than the experimental values.

In this case, the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion for the Ar isotopes with A > 36 is taken

into account in the calculation of the Coulomb displacement energies. The distribution

ρexc(r) of the N − Z excess neutrons are evaluated with two of the N − Z excess neutrons in

the 2s1/2 orbital and the others in the 1f7/2 and higher level orbitals. The numerical results

are given in Table 3 and plotted in Fig. 4 on the same scales as Fig. 3.

It is seen from Fig. 4 that, in this case, the results are lowered or shifted down a little

in comparison with the results of Case 1. The experimental results nearly fall between

the theoretical results obtained from the two parameter sets; the deviations between the

results obtained with the NL-SH parameters and the experimental ones are reduced, yet

the results given by the NL-SH parameters are still a little larger than the experimental

results; however, the deviations of the results given by the TM1/TM2 parameters from the

experimental ones are enlarged slightly.

To show the eﬀects of the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 state level inversion on the Coulomb displace-

ment energy, we calculated the diﬀerences of the results between Case 1 and Case 2 for

either parameter set. The results are shown in Table 4 and plotted in Fig. 5, where

The results in Table 4 show that the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 level inversion of Ar isotopes leads

a reduction to the Coulomb displacement energies by 0.06∼0.17 MeV for the Ar-K isobaric

pairs, and the largest reduction, which occurs to the Ar-K pairs near A = 41, is about 0.17

MeV. A circumstantial evidence for our result was given in Ref. [23], where the eﬀects of the

halo on the Coulomb displacement energy for the isobaric analog state of 11Li were inves-

tigated, and the halo is found to reduce the Coulomb displacement energy by 0.100∼0.200

MeV. The plots in Fig. 5 show that the trends of variation of the diﬀerences δ given by the

two sets of parameters are approximately the same.

Finally, a few remarks on the result of the 46Ar-46K pair should be made. It can be found

from panel (b) of Fig. 3 or Fig. 4 that the experimental result of the 46Ar-46K pair seems to

have a “strange behavior”; it shows a deviation, an up warp, from the gradually decreasing

trend of variation of the Coulomb displacement energies of the Ar-K pairs with the increase

of mass number. This deviation is not reproduced by either set of parameters in either cases.

This may imply either that the description of very neutron-rich Ar-K pair by the relativistic

mean ﬁeld model is not so good as that of the nuclei near the stability line or that there is a

lack of accuracy in the experimental result for the 46Ar-46K pair, since the excitation energy

for 46K given in Ref. [22] is just an approximate value (≈ 11.470 MeV).

III. SUMMARY

Within the relativistic mean ﬁeld model, the Coulomb displacement energies of the Ar-K

isobaric analog state pairs with mass number A ranging from 35 to 47 are calculated directly

with the Coulomb potential generated by the core protons and the distribution of the N − Z

excess neutrons within the relativistic mean ﬁeld model. The calculation is carried out in

two cases: In one case (Case 1), the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 state level inversion is not considered,
i.e., two of the N − Z excess neutrons are assumed to be in the 1d3/2 orbital; in another

case (Case 2), the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 state level inversion is taken into account, i.e., two of
the N − Z excess neutrons are assumed to be in the 2s1/2 orbital. The results show that

the 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 state level inversion may lead a reduction of no more than 0.17 MeV
to the Coulomb displacement energy, and the largest reduction may occur to the 40−42Ar-

40−42K pair. The results may provide a reference for experimentally studying the 2s1/2 and
1d3/2 state level inversion. In addition, the 46Ar-46K pair is also discussed for its “seemingly

strange” experimental value.
