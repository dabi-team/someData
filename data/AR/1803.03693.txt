ABSTRACT
Uncertainties in atomic models will introduce noticeable additional systematics in calculating the ﬂux of weak di-
electronic recombination (DR) satellite lines, aﬀecting the detection and ﬂux measurements of other weak spectral
lines. One important example is the Ar xvii Heβ DR, which is expected to be present in emission from the hot
intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters and could impact measurements of the ﬂux of the 3.5 keV line that has
been suggested as a secondary emission from a dark matter interaction. We perform a set of experiments using the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s electron beam ion trap (EBIT-I) and the X-Ray Spectrometer quantum
calorimeter (XRS/EBIT), to test the Ar xvii Heβ DR origin of the 3.5 keV line. We measured the X-ray emission
following resonant DR onto helium-like and lithium-like Argon using EBIT-I’s Maxwellian simulator mode at a simu-
lated electron temperature of Te=1.74 keV. The measured ﬂux of the Ar xvii Heβ DR lined is too weak to account
for the ﬂux in the 3.5 keV line assuming reasonable plasma parameters. We, therefore, rule out Ar xvii Heβ DR as
a signiﬁcant contributor to the 3.5 keV line. A comprehensive comparison between the atomic theory and the EBIT
experiment results is also provided.

1. INTRODUCTION

Since its discovery, the nature of dark matter has been
one of the prime problems of physics. A range of exotic
particles, which could constitute the dark matter con-
tent of the Universe, have been widely investigated by
ground- and space-based direct and indirect searches.
Observations of dark matter dominated objects with
space telescopes provide an avenue for indirect detec-
tion of secondary emission from dark matter interac-
tions. An intriguing detection of an emission line at
∼ 3.5 keV has been reported by Bulbul et al. (2014a,
B14a hereafter) in the stacked observations of clusters
of galaxies and in many other dark matter-dominated-
objects (Boyarsky et al. 2014, 2015; Urban et al. 2015;
Franse et al. 2016; Neronov et al. 2016; Bulbul et al.
2016; ?). The origin of the emission line is still un-
der discussion, with one proposal being that the X-rays
are produced by the secondary emission of dark mat-
ter particles (e.g. Abazajian 2017; Conlon et al. 2016).
Alternative astrophysical origins of the unidentiﬁed line
have been extensively discussed in Bu14a and Gu et al.
(2015), one of which is the possibility that it results from
an unexpectedly strong dielectronic recombination (DR)
satellite line created when He-like Ar16+ recombines to
form Li-like Ar15+. Uncertainties on the atomic calcu-
lations of weak satellite lines, such as the Ar xvii Heβ
DR transition 1s 2p 3p 2D5/2 → 1s22p 2P3/2, may intro-
duce unknown systematics on the measured ﬂux of the
3.5 keV line and provide an alternative explanation of
the origin of the line (Bulbul et al. 2014a,b, B14a, B14b
hereafter).

Measurements performed using the EBIT-I electron
beam ion trap (EBIT; Levine et al. 1988; Marrs et al.
1988; Marrs 2008; Beiersdorfer et al. 2003; Beiersdorfer
2008) located at Lawrence Livermore National Labora-
tory (LLNL) provide an avenue for testing the Ar xvii
Heβ DR origin of the 3.5 keV line and evaluation of the
atomic databases, e.g. AtomDB v2.0.2 and FAC (Fos-
ter et al. 2012). Using a unique operating mode, EBIT-
I generates a quasi-Maxwellian distribution of electron
energies (Savin et al. 2000, 2008) at electron temper-
atures similar to those found in astrophysical objects
in thermal equilibrium. Measurements using this mode
have been used to test atomic theory for highly charged
ions of iron (Gu et al. 2012) and gold (May et al. 2004,
2005). In addition, the accuracy of the Maxwellian gen-
erator has also been tested using well-known intensity
ratios from helium-like ions (Savin et al. 2000, 2008) and
hydrogen-like ions (Gu et al. 2012). Measurements us-
ing this mode include all relevant population processes
in a complete way, i.e., there is no limit to the num-
ber of transitions that are included, unlike in computer
models. We have used this mode to generate an ar-
gon plasma at kTe ∼ 1.7 keV and to measure the emis-
sion using a high-resolution quantum calorimeter, which
is similar to the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) (Kel-

ley et al. 2016) ﬂown on the Hitomi X-ray Observatory
(Takahashi et al. 2016) and which includes all line emis-
sion from K-shell transitions in highly charged argon
spanning the 3 keV to 4 keV band. These measure-
ments include emission from the Ar XVII He-α complex
Ar XVIII Ly-α, and Ar XVII He-β, γ, δ and (cid:15) lines, with
their relative intensities to the He-like Ar XVII He-α res-
onance line at 3.12 keV. These new measurements are
complementary to measurements conducted earlier us-
ing a high resolution crystal spectrometer attached to
the Princeton Large Torus (Beiersdorfer et al. 1995). In
that work, the authors measured the Kβ line of He-
like Ar16+ in the energy range of 3.54 keV to 3.71 keV
and successfully identiﬁed Ar xvi lines produced by di-
electronic recombination from Ar16+ to Ar15+ as well as
lines from electron-impact excitation, the latter not only
from He-like Ar16+, but also from lithium-like Ar15+ and
beryllium-like Ar14+. Here, we use EBIT-I to directly
measure the spectrum of highly charged argon ions in
a simulated Maxwellian plasma (see Section 2) reaching
down to 3 keV. Using the data from both the new mea-
surements and from those of Beiersdorfer et al. (1995), a
stringent test of the models used by B14a is completed.
We compare the line ratios measured by the new EBIT
measurements with the observed line ratios in XMM-
Newton and Chandra observations of stacked clusters
where the unidentiﬁed line has been observed with the
highest signiﬁcance.

This paper is organized as follows. We provide details
of the EBIT-I experiment design in Section 2. In Sec-
tion 3, we provided details of the atomic models used:
since the older version of AtomDB v2.0.2 used in B14a
cannot analyze the EBIT-I plasma, we include here a
comparison between the AtomDB versions. The anal-
ysis in Section 4 compares the EBIT-I spectrum with
the FAC and AtomDB v3.0.8 models, then explores the
eﬀects of these results on the discoveries in B14a. We
ﬁnally summarize our conclusion in Section 5. All er-
rors quoted throughout the paper correspond to 68%
single-parameter conﬁdence intervals.

2. EXPERIMENT DESIGN

The results presented here are measured using EBIT-
I’s Maxwellian simulation mode (Savin et al. 2000,
2008). In this mode, the electron beam is “swept” in a
voltage pattern that, when averaged over several cycles,
corresponds to a Maxwell-Boltzmann electron distribu-
tion at an experimentally controlled temperature. The
electron beam energy is “swept” from below threshold
for any relevant process that may contribute to the line
emission of interest, such as low-energy DR resonances,
up to electron energies ≥ 6 times the simulated temper-
ature. For example, for the ∼2 keV plasma presented
here where the focus is on K-shell emission from highly
charged argon ions and where all the relevant dielec-
tronic resonance energies are above 2 keV, the beam is
swept from 1.5 keV up to 24 keV. The electron den-

sity for this measurement is ∼ 1011 cm−3. One caveat
of the Maxwellian mode is that the plasma generated
in EBIT has a lower average charge than a plasma in
true thermal equilibrium, thus intensities of line emis-
sion from diﬀerent ions will not be representative of a
Maxwellian plasma. However, the relative intensities
of emission lines whose excited states are dominated by
processes involving a single ion, such as ratios of two He-
like lines or of a resonance line and a DR satellite from
the same parent charge state, are the same as found in
a true Maxwell-Boltzmann plasma (Savin et al. 2000,
2008; Gu et al. 2012). This is supported by the results
presented here for both He-like argon and H-like argon.
The spectra are measured using the X-Ray Spectrom-
eter (XRS)/EBIT quantum calorimeter (Porter et al.
2000, 2004) designed and built at the NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center. The XRS/EBIT is an energy-
dispersive spectrometer with an energy resolution of
∆ E ∼ 5 eV, a bandwidth that spans the range from be-
low 500 eV to about 10 keV, and a quantum eﬃciency
of 100% for photon energies up to ∼6 keV. Owing to
the fact that the XRS/EBIT calorimeter array operates
at 60 mK, it must be shielded from higher-temperature
sections of the spectrometer. This is achieved via four
aluminized polyimide blocking ﬁlters. In addition, there
is an insertable aluminized polyimide ﬁlter mounted be-
tween EBIT-I and the XRS/EBIT. This ﬁlter was used
to reduce ﬂux from low energy photons. The combined
thickness of the ﬁlters is 3824 ˚A of aluminum and 14310
˚A of polyimide. The relative X-ray transmission eﬃ-
ciency through these ﬁlters for the photon energies stud-
ied here is 3%. The XRS/EBIT viewed the trapped ions
through one of EBIT-I’s six radial ports oriented at 90◦
to the electron beam. Neutral argon gas is introduced to

the trap continuously via a diﬀerentially pumped, colli-
mated ballistic gas injector, also attached to one of the
six radial ports. Once injected, argon atoms intersect
the beam and are then ionized and trapped.

3. ATOMIC MODELING

3.1. AtomDB

The AtomDB project couples an atomic database with
a model of optically thin, collisionally ionized plasma to
produce emission spectra predictions for astrophysical
plasma. This model is known as the apec model in the
XSPEC analysis suite (Arnaud 1996), and was used in
Bu14a and Bu14b. These papers used AtomDB v2.0.2
models (Foster et al. 2012), while in this work we use
the more recent AtomDB v3.0.8. The atomic data is
largely similar between the two, but some fundamental
changes to the structure of the database and code have
made this later version more suitable to this work.

The AtomDB atomic database consists of data from
a wide range of sources for the emissivities. For Argon,
the ionization and recombination rates are taken from
Bryans et al. (2006, 2009). For each ion for Ar14+ to
Ar17+, we list the sources of other atomic data in Table
1. Note that for each process within each ion, some-
times several diﬀerent data sources are used based on
the coverage of the published data sets. Therefore, in
Table 1 we list only those most relevant to the ions and
lines observed in this work. All of the atomic data is
available online 1.

The updates to both the atomic data and the under-
lying structure of AtomDB between version 2.0.2 and

3.0.8 are minor. The changes are adjusted wavelengths
to NIST values where possible: this has little eﬀect on
this work as typical adjustments were on the 1-2 eV
range, signiﬁcantly smaller than the spectral resolution
of the instruments in B14a. The more signiﬁcant up-
date is to include representation of inner shell excitation,
and generally improve representation of non-equilibrium
plasma. This involves using published data for inner
shell ionization and ﬂuorescence yields, as well as new
Li-like electron collision data to include the eﬀect of the
inner shell excitation. In addition, the plasma calcula-
tions are reworked completely. Instead of calculating the
emission based upon the ion containing the transition
(so for the Heα line, looking at Ar16+), the emissivities
are broken up by parent ion. Thus an ion of, say, Ar16+
can give rise to lines from Ar XVI due to dielectronic
or radiative recombination, Ar XVII due to excitation
and Ar XVIII due to excitation-autoionization or direct
ionization. Since emissivity is calculated by ion, it is
possible to model the ionization balance found in the
EBIT-I’s Maxwellian simulation mode.

DR Satellite lines are included in AtomDB from Vain-
shtein & Safronova (1980). This data set includes cap-
ture from H- and He-like Ar ions, but not Li-like. Due
to the enhanced Li-like DR line presence, we have added
the 1s2s2l3l(cid:48) satellite lines to our model, using the pa-
rameters from Table VI of Beiersdorfer et al. (1995). In
addition, the 1s3l3l(cid:48) satellites from capture from He-
like ions is also not in AtomDB v3.0.8, so the data from
Table V of that paper has also been included. All of
these lines lie between 3.54 and 3.69 keV, and therefore
could be an additional source of emissivity missing from
the models in B14a. These satellite lines, calculated by
HULLAC (Bar-Shalom et al. 2001), have been veriﬁed
experimentally by Beiersdorfer et al. (1995) in similar
plasma temperatures to those expected in clusters, i.e.
kT = 2.3keV.

3.1.1. Comparison of AtomDB 3.0.8 to AtomDB 2.0.2

It is not possible to analyze the EBIT-I data with
AtomDB v2.0.2 due to the structural diﬀerences out-
lines above. We have therefore analyzed the data in
this paper with AtomDB v3.0.8, and in this section
we explore the diﬀerences between AtomDB v2.0.2 and
AtomDB v3.0.8 to show that results obtained in this
work are similar to what would have happened in B14a.
The eﬀect of changing between these two data sets
is shown in Table 2 for a Maxwellian plasma with
kT=1.74 keV(see Section 4 for the details on the tem-
perature estimate). The emissivity of the strongest lines
changes by less than 5%, so any changes due to this are
negligible compared to the factor of 2 diﬀerence between
the experiment and the AtomDB values. We shall ig-
nore any contributions from this for the remainder of
this work.

3.2. The Flexible Atomic Code (FAC)

The Flexible Atomic Code (FAC; Gu 2004, 2008) is a
comprehensive code that calculates energy levels, tran-
sition rates and cross sections. Additionally, FAC con-
tains a collisional radiative model that estimates the line
strengths for optically thin plasmas based on the atomic
physics parameters previously calculated with FAC. The
ion abundances, choice of processes to include, electron
density, and electron distribution are user input param-
eters. The electron energy distribution can be chosen
freely from pre-deﬁned functions, e.g., a Gaussian dis-
tribution for electron beams or a Maxwellian distribu-
tion for thermal plasmas, or user-deﬁned through a table
model.

Here, we used FAC to calculate the energy levels for H-
like through B-like Ar for conﬁgurations of the form: n(cid:96)
(H-like); 1s2, 1s n(cid:96), 2(cid:96) 2(cid:96)(cid:48), and 2(cid:96) n(cid:96)(cid:48) (He-like); 1s2 2(cid:96)x,
1s2 2(cid:96)x−1 n(cid:96)(cid:48), 1s 2(cid:96)y, 1s 2(cid:96)y−1 n(cid:96)(cid:48) (Li- to B-like), allow-
ing for spectator electrons up to n=5. Transition rates
and cross sections were calculated for transitions be-
tween any of these conﬁguration groups. We then used
the data to calculate the plasma model at temperatures
in the range 1.2 to 3.0 keV, including radiative decay,
collisional (de-)excitation and ionization, radiative re-
combination, dielectronic recombination, and autoion-
ization. For the relative ion abundances we used FAC’s
default charge balance at the respective temperatures.
The Maxwellian electron energy distribution for each
temperature was integrated between 50 eV and 20 keV
and an electron density of 1 × 1011 cm−3 was assumed.
We then convolved the resulting line strengths for each
transition with a Gaussian line proﬁle of 5.0 eV FWHM
to produce the ﬁnal spectrum.

To obtain the theoretical DR/Lyα line ratio, we then
summed the spectra in the range of 3250–3307 eV for
the DR lines and 3307–3340 eV for the Lyα lines such
that the unresolved DR resonance blending with the Lyα
lines are included in the line ratio. Neglecting the unre-
solved blends to Lyα would falsely result in an increase
of the ratio by between 23% at 1.2 keV and 6% at 3.0 keV
electron temperature.

4. RESULTS

The electron temperature of the EBIT-I plasma is de-
termined using the line ratio of the Ar XVIII Lyα DR
lines to their parent Ar XVIII Lyα line (Gu et al. 2012).
This method has been well tested and only relies on the
presence of hydrogenic ions. Figure 1 shows the temper-
ature dependence of this ratio given by AtomDB v3.0.8
and FAC. Before comparing the measured ratio to the-
ory, polarization eﬀects must be taken into account. As
a result of the unidirectional electron beam, electron
beam ion traps produce non-isotropic, polarized radia-
tion which depends on both electron impact energy and
transition (Beiersdorfer et al. 1996; Gu et al. 1999). This
eﬀect is reduced by the fact that electrons in the beam
have a spiral trajectory caused by their thermal velocity
when they are generated at the electron gun. In general,

Diﬀerences to Table 4 are due to the diﬀerences in charge balance between the ﬁtted model and the theoretical Maxwellian.

polarization is reduced as a function of electron impact
energy. The polarization of Lyα1 is measured to be ∼
0.1 by Nakamura et al. (2001). This result is consistent
with a more recent theory (Bostock et al. 2009). In the
case of the DR emission, a range of polarization values
are predicted owing to the fact that several transitions
of the type 1s2(cid:96) make up this feature make up this fea-
ture. The DR features consist of several transitions with
a range of polarization values, most of which are posi-
tive. Using the calculations of (Chen & Scoﬁeld 1995)
as a guide, we assign an average value of P = 0.5 to
all the H-like Ar DR satellites. Because of the depolar-
izing eﬀect of the spiraling beam and the fact that the
electron beam energy is swept across a large range for
these measurements, we make no correction for polar-
ization for this ratio and assign an uncertainty resulting
from polarization in the ratio of ±10%. This is deter-
mined by nearly the full range of polarization correction
factors, including the possibility of the DR polarization
being largely negative. This uncertainty, combined with
the statistical uncertainty of ∼ 7%, gives a ratio of the
Ar XVIII Lyα DR line to the parent line of 0.135 ±
0.016. This ratio corresponds to a plasma temperature
of 1.74 ± 0.08 keV based on the AtomDB model and
1.64±0.08 keV based on the FAC model (see Figure 1).
Using the Maxwellian temperature of kTe = 1.74 keV,
we calculate the spectra created by Ar14+ – Ar18+ us-
ing AtomDB v3.0.8. The lines are broadened with a
FWHM of 5 eV to match the observed EBIT calorime-
ter response. In a true Maxwellian plasma, such as is
expected in central region of galaxy clusters, the charge
state distribution for a kTe = 1.74 keV plasma would be
multiplied by each ion’s emissivity, i.e.

Countstot(E) = C

where C is a constant coeﬃcient incorporating the vol-
ume, number density of electrons and argon ions, and
detector eﬃciency, ε(E) is the emissivity in each energy
bin, E, and Nz1 is the fraction of argon ions in ion state
z1, where z1 is the ion charge +1.

Figure 1. AtomDB v3.0.8 and FAC predicted temperature
dependence of the Ar XVIII Lyα DR to the Ar XVIII Lyα
lines are shown. The line ratio is compared with the EBIT
measurement with its uncertainty limits (shaded cyan re-
gion). AtomDB v3.0.8 predictions show that the EBIT mea-
surements are consistent with a Maxwellian Te = 1.74 ±
0.08 keV.

studying.

For the given charge balance in the EBIT-I Maxwellian
plasma, ignoring polarization eﬀects, the ratio of He-β
DR to He-β1,2 is 0.36 ± 0.02 where the error is given
by the quadrature sum of background subtraction and
statistics. If we assume maximum polarization for He-β1
of P=0.63 (Smith et al. 1996) and for the DR satellites
of 0.4, the ratio becomes 0.4, i.e., it changes by 10%
(Smith et al. 2000). However, owing to the fact that the
beam dynamics are not well known and the polarization
was not measured in-situ, the correction for polariza-
tion is not well known. Thus we assume the maximum

malized ﬂux in each of twelve energy bands from both
the theoretical and observed EBIT spectra, each corre-
sponding to a diﬀerent line. The ﬂuxes are normalized
to the Ar XVII He-α feature ﬂux for each spectrum.
The ratios for the non-DR lines are within 10% of their
predicted values, with the exception of the weak Lyβ
feature at 3.935 keV, which is 35% stronger in the ex-
perimental data. The DR lines for both Ar XVII and
Ar XVIII are signiﬁcantly stronger in the EBIT experi-
ment than predicted by our ﬁt model, by factors of 2.4
and 1.5 respectively. This is traced to missing satellite
transitions in each band.

4.1. Eﬀect of additional DR satellite lines

In this section, we discuss the eﬀects of adding in a
range of additional DR satellite lines on our results. In
the ﬁrst case, we added the HULLAC data discussed
in Section 3.1.
Including and removing these had no
noticeable change on the ion fractions of Table 3, with
the change in each relative ion fraction being less than
1%. Where this does make a diﬀerence is the Ar xviDR
satellites in the 3.55–3.59 keV band. These signiﬁcantly
improve the ﬁt between the EBIT and theoretical data.
Figure 4 shows Ar xviXVI DR satellite lines in the
3.5–3.7 keV band, the only region with any signiﬁcant
change. The ﬂuxes of these added lines are still signiﬁ-
cantly weaker than required to account for the 3.5 keV
line ﬂux observed in clusters: they amount to one quar-
ter of the ﬂux in the 3.62 keV line, which is itself too
small. Therefore this neither explains the 3.55keV fea-
ture in B14a, nor explains the extra ﬂux in the Ar xvii
Heβ DR lines.

Guided by the lower temperature obtained from
the FAC data ﬁt than the AtomDB ﬁt (1.64 keV vs
1.74 keV), we have also investigated a range of electron
temperatures in the 1.5 to 1.8 keV range. These yield no
signiﬁcant change (< 2% diﬀerence) in the ion fractions,
and no signiﬁcant change in the resulting ﬂux ratios in
the 3.62 keV region. Additionally, adjusting the wave-
length of the DR satellite lines to match the 3.62 keV
line more closely does not lead to any signiﬁcant change
in the modeled ion fractions or line ﬂuxes in this region,

tained from the EBIT and the modeled Maxwellian plasma
obtained from AtomDB v3.0.8 in the full 3–4 keV energy
band. The normalized y-axis is normalized to the Ar XVII
resonance line. The EBIT spectrum is shifted by +5 eV to
show the diﬀerence between AtomDB v3.0.8 and EBIT spec-
tra. The emission lines from diﬀerent Ar species are marked
on the spectrum. Large discrepancies in the Ar XVIII lines
are due to the non-Maxwellian equilibrium ionization balance
in the EBIT, which is assumed in the AtomDB spectrum.

Maxwellian velocity distributions in the measurement,
we determine the ion charge states by treating each ion
as having an independent scaling factor, i.e.

and then ﬁtting the data in the 3–4 keV band to these
spectra to obtain the Cz1. The ratio of these deter-
mines the charge state distribution. We obtain best-ﬁt
ion fractions as shown in Table 3, showing a signiﬁcant
increase in the Li-like Ar fraction in the EBIT at the ex-
pense of the H-like stage compared with a Maxwellian
plasma.

In Figure 2 we show the spectrum of a 1.74 keV plasma
from AtomDB v3.0.8 and the observed EBIT spectrum,
labeling the strong lines of Ar. We stressed that the
EBIT spectrum is artiﬁcially shifted by +5 eV to show
the diﬀerence between AtomDB v3.0.8 and the mea-
sured EBIT spectra. As can be seen, there is a sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in the Lyman series line intensities as
there are a lot fewer Ar17+ ions in EBIT than predicted
for a Maxwellian charge distribution. Figure 3 compares
the spectra for four diﬀerent energy ranges between the
EBIT and the spectrum with the ﬁtted EBIT ion ratios
(e.g., 3.08 − 3.16 keV, 3.2 − 3.4 keV, 3.6 − 3.7 keV, and
3.85 − 4.1 keV). It shows that the model is generally a
good ﬁt to the observed data, in particular the Lyα lines
as well as the Heα, Heβ, and Heγ. There is a noticeable

as the line’s modeled emissivity is constrained by the
3.68 keV line.

4.2. Comparison with FAC data

In an eﬀort to identify the 3.64keV feature, which was
not in the AtomDB data, we used the FAC data already
calculated to predict this feature, as shown in Figure
5. The results of this suggest the 3.64 keV feature is
largely driven by 1s2p3[pd] → 1s22p transitions in the
Li like ion. These satellites are not included in the work
of (Vainshtein & Safronova 1980), which explains their
absence from the AtomDB v3.0.8 spectrum.

4.3. Comparison with Bulbul et al. (2014a)

One of the suggested interpretations of the 3.5 keV
line is an unexpectedly strong Ar xvii Heβ DR dielec-
tronic recombination satellite line created by recombin-
ing He-like Ar xvii at 3.62 keV. Indeed, if the Ar xvii
Heβ DR line is 30 times stronger than the predicted
strength in AtomDB v2.0.2, this would explain the ex-
cess observed in the stacked clusters (see B14a). The line

ratios and line ﬂuxes presented in this work correspond
to a Maxwellian plasma with 1.74 keV temperature that
is similar to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) tempera-
tures of cool core clusters.
In this section we ﬁt the
XMM-Newton spectra of the stacked clusters of galaxies
in B14a with the new EBIT measurements to measure
the eﬀect of atomic database changes to the detection
of the 3.5 keV line.

In the ﬁts of the B14a stacked sample (and in all other
samples), the maximum ﬂux for the Ar xvii Heβ DR line
at 3.62 keV was initially set to 1% of the Ar xvii Heα
line at 3.12 keV in the spectral ﬁts. The 3.62 keV ﬂux
was allowed to go a factor of three above these estimates
as safety margin to account for the uncertainties in the
emissivities of the weak DR lines. The upper limit cor-
responds to the highest ﬂux that Ar xvii Heβ DR can
have for the lowest ICM plasma temperature (2 keV)
observed in B14a. For instance, the observed ﬂux mea-
sured in the Ar xvii Heα line is 2.1 × 10−5 counts cm−2
s−1. The allowed ﬂux upper limit for the Ar xvii Heβ
DR line is 6.3 × 10−7 counts cm−2 s−1, which is in the

limits of the observed ratio by EBIT. Indeed, ﬁtting the
3–6 keV band of the XMM-Newton MOS spectrum of the
stacked cluster sample with the new ratios indicated by
the EBIT-I experiment, the 3.5 keV line is still detected
at a 5σ conﬁdence level with a ﬂux of 3.98±0.7 × 10−6
photons cm−2 s−1. Therefore, we rule out here that the
excess emission observed in the stacked clusters and the
Perseus cluster is due to the satellite Ar xvii Heβ DR
lines in the 3.5–3.7 keV energy band.

We present lab measurements of the Ar14+ – Ar18+

We obtain a detailed spectrum including faint di-
electronic satellites lines and compare the emissivities
with the atomic calculations in the atomic database
AtomDB v3.0.8. Our major results are as follows.

1. We ﬁnd that the EBIT-I data from a pseudo-
Maxwellian plasma of highly charged argon ions
are consistent with an ionization temperature of
Te= 1.7 keV for a plasma with a Maxwellian elec-
tron distribution. This temperature is comparable
to the plasma temperatures observed in cool-core
galaxy clusters, therefore EBIT-I Ar ﬂux measure-
ments can directly be compared to the X-ray data
in B14a.

2. The EBIT-I data are consistent with the predic-
tions of the He-like Ar lines, Heα, Heβ, and Heγ
emissivities of the model within 10%.

3. We have identiﬁed new satellite lines in the 3.5–
3.7 keV band. These additional lines, however,
are too weak to resolve the ﬂux discrepancies near
3.5 keV line as their ﬂuxes are ∼0.5% of that of
Ar XVII Heα line. These have been attributed to
the 1s2p3[pd] → 1s22p satellite lines.

4. The measured ﬂux in the Ar XVII He-β DR
line is 2.4 times higher than that predicted in
AtomDB v3.0.8. However, a factor of 3 safety
margin was allowed in B14a to account for un-
certainties in the satellite line ﬂuxes. Fitting
the XMM-Newton spectrum of the stacked clus-
ters sample with the ratios indicated by the new
EBIT measurements produces a 3.5 keV line ﬂux
of 3.98 ± 0.7 × 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1. The
unidentiﬁed line is still detected at the 5σ conﬁ-
dence level. These new EBIT measurements rule

ﬁed emission line detected in clusters of galaxies
at 3.5 keV.

The EBIT measurements of charged Ar14+ – Ar18+
ions presented in this work provide independent tests on
theoretical calculations and are essential when interpret-
ing the high resolution spectra which will be available
through XARM and Athena XIFU observations (Nandra
et al. 2013; Barret et al. 2018).
