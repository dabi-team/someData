We report the ﬁrst measurement of π0 production in neutral current (NC) interactions on argon
with average neutrino energy of <
∼ 1 GeV. We use data from the MicroBooNE detector’s 85-tonne
active volume liquid argon time projection chamber situated in Fermilab’s Booster Neutrino Beam
and exposed to 5.89 × 1020 protons on target for this measurement. Measurements of NC π0 events
are reported for two exclusive event topologies without charged pions. Those include a topology
with two photons from the decay of the π0 and one proton and a topology with two photons and
zero protons. Flux-averaged cross-sections for each exclusive topology and for their semi-inclusive
combination are extracted (eﬃciency-correcting for two-plus proton ﬁnal states), and the results are
compared to predictions from the genie, neut, and NuWro neutrino event generators. We measure
cross sections of 1.243 ± 0.185 (syst) ±0.076 (stat), 0.444 ± 0.098 ± 0.047, and 0.624 ± 0.131 ± 0.075
[10−38cm2/Ar] for the semi-inclusive NCπ0, exclusive NCπ0+1p, and exclusive NCπ0+0p processes,
respectively.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrino-nucleus cross-sections have been the subject
of intense study both experimentally and within the the-
ory community in recent years due to their role in inter-
preting neutrino oscillation measurements and searches
for other rare processes in neutrino scattering [1]. While
neutrino oscillation experiments primarily rely on mea-
suring the rate of charged current (CC) interactions, it
is also important that we build a solid understanding of
inclusive and exclusive neutral current (NC) neutrino in-
teractions.

NC neutrino interactions are of particular importance
to νe and ¯νe measurements in the energy range of a
few hundred MeV. This is especially true for detectors
that cannot perfectly diﬀerentiate between photon- and
electron-induced electromagnetic showers, and therefore
where NC π0 production followed by the subsequent de-
cay π0 → γγ can be misidentiﬁed as νe or ¯νe CC scat-
tering. Misidentiﬁcation of photons as electrons compli-
cates the interpretation of νe appearance measurements
aiming to measure subtle signals. These include ster-
ile neutrino oscillation searches with the upcoming Short
Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experimental program [2] and
CP violation measurements and mass hierarchy deter-
mination with the future Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) [3].

Furthermore, NC π0 events can contribute as back-
ground to searches for rare neutrino scattering processes
such as NC ∆ resonance production followed by ∆ radia-
tive decay, or NC coherent single-photon production at
energies below 1 GeV [4]. This is primarily a consequence

∗ microboone info@fnal.gov

of the limited geometric acceptance of some detectors,
whereby one of the photons from a π0 decay can escape
the active volume of the detector. Depending on a detec-
tor’s ability to resolve electromagnetic shower substruc-
ture, NC π0 events can further contribute as background
to searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model
(BSM), such as e+e− production predicted by a number
of BSM models [5–9].

Finally, NC measurements themselves can provide a
unique channel for probing new physics. For example,
searches for non-unitarity in the three-neutrino paradigm
or searches for active to sterile neutrino oscillations
are possible via NC rate disappearance measurements
[10, 11]. Such searches can provide complementary in-
formation to non-unitarity or light sterile neutrino oscil-
lation parameters otherwise accessible only through CC
measurements.

Using a liquid argon time projection chamber
(LArTPC) as its active detector, MicroBooNE [12]
shares the same technology and neutrino target nucleus
as the upcoming SBN and future DUNE experiments.
MicroBooNE’s 85 metric ton active volume LArTPC
is situated 468.5 m away from the proton beam tar-
get in the muon-neutrino-dominated Booster Neutrino
Beam (BNB) at Fermilab [13] which is also used by
SBN. The resulting neutrino beam has a mean energy
(cid:104)Eν(cid:105) = 0.8 GeV and is composed of 93.7% νµ, 5.8% ¯νµ,
and 0.5% νe/¯νe. MicroBooNE’s cross-section measure-
ments on argon are therefore timely and directly relevant
to these future (SBN and DUNE) programs.

We present the ﬁrst measurement of neutrino-induced
NC single-π0 (1π0) production on argon with a mean
neutrino energy in the 1 GeV regime, which is also the
highest-statistics measurement of this interaction chan-
nel on argon to date. This measurement is relevant to
the physics programs of experiments that operate in the

few-GeV regime (SBN [2], DUNE [3], NOνA [14, 15],
T2K [16], and Hyper-K [17]), especially those which share
argon as a target material. Additionally, this measure-
ment has been used to provide an indirect constraint to
the rate of NC 1π0 backgrounds in MicroBooNE’s recent
search for a single-photon excess [4]. The only previous
results for NC 1π0 scattering on argon are from the Ar-
goNeuT collaboration using the NuMI beam which has a
much higher mean neutrino beam energy of 9.6 GeV for
νµ and of 3.6 GeV for νµ [18].

The interaction ﬁnal states that are measured in this

analysis are deﬁned as

ν + A → ν + A(cid:48) + π0 + X,

(1)

where A represents the struck (argon) nucleus, A(cid:48) rep-
resents the residual nucleus, and X represents exactly
one or zero protons plus any number of neutrons, but no
other hadrons or leptons. The protons are identiﬁable
in the MicroBooNE LArTPC by their distinct ionizing
tracks while the π0 is identiﬁable through the presence
of two distinct electromagnetic showers, one for each pho-
ton from the π0 → γγ decay, with kinematic properties
such that they reconstruct to approximately the π0 in-
variant mass.

These one proton and zero proton samples are used
ﬁrst to perform a rate validation check and subsequently
in three distinct cross-section measurements. By lever-
aging the capability of LArTPCs to detect and identify
protons we perform the world’s ﬁrst exclusive NCπ0+0p
and NCπ0+1p cross-section extractions and additionally
measure the cross-section for NCπ0 interactions semi-
inclusively using both the one proton and zero proton
samples combined. Each of these cross-section extrac-
tions utilizes a distinct signal deﬁnition. The signal
deﬁnitions for the two exclusive measurements place a
threshold on true proton kinetic energy of greater than
50 MeV, while the semi-inclusive measurement allows for
any number of protons. The signal deﬁnitions for all
three measurements also require that there are no other
hadrons or leptons in the ﬁnal state (as noted above).
MeV-scale photons, which may arise from nuclear de-
excitation processes within the struck nucleus, are al-
lowed in the ﬁnal state. Finally, the signal deﬁnitions
allow for interactions of all ﬂavors of neutrinos that are
present: νµ, ¯νµ, νe, and ¯νe.

These deﬁnitions are comparable to other historical
NC π0 measurements which typically require one and
only one π0 meson and little hadronic activity in the
detector [19–28]. This diﬀers from the more inclusive
approach of the ArgoNeuT experiment motivated both
by its higher energy beam as well as the need to miti-
gate the low statistics of its data sample [18]. Making
use of the MicroBooNE LArTPC’s power in examining
hadronic ﬁnal state multiplicities and kinematic proper-
ties with high resolution, the ﬂux-averaged cross-sections
extracted in this analysis extend our understanding of
this important interaction channel. The exclusive cross-
sections reported provide new information useful for the

3

tuning of NC 1π0 production and nuclear ﬁnal state in-
teractions in neutrino-argon scattering models, while the
semi-inclusive cross-section enables a direct comparison
to the MiniBooNE measurement of NC π0 production.

II. ANALYSIS OVERVIEW

This measurement uses data corresponding to a BNB
exposure of 5.89 × 1020 protons on target (POT), col-
lected during the period 2016–2018 and referred to as
“Runs 1–3” in many of the subsequent ﬁgures. Neutrino-
argon interactions are simulated using a custom tune [29]
of the genie neutrino event generator v3.0.6 [30, 31]
(based on model set G18 10a 02 11a) adopted by the
MicroBooNE Collaboration. This tune speciﬁcally tar-
gets CC quasi-elastic (QE) and CC multi-nucleon in-
teraction models and overall has very little direct eﬀect
on this NC-focused analysis. genie v3 uses the Berger-
Sehgal [32, 33] model for resonant production of π0 and
includes improved agreement with an expanded data set
for the A-dependence of ﬁnal state interactions (FSI), up-
dated form factors [34], updated diagrams for pion pro-
duction processes [33, 35, 36], and a new tune to neutrino-
proton and neutrino-deuterium cross-section data [31].
The MicroBooNE Monte Carlo (MC) prediction further
makes use of geant4 v4 10 3 03c [37] for particle propa-
gation and re-interactions within the detector and a cus-
tom detector response model all implemented within the
LArSoft framework [38].

The MicroBooNE data and MC reconstruction chain
begins by reading out and processing the ionization
charge signals detected on the 8,192 wires that make
up the three anode planes of the MicroBooNE LArTPC.
The procedure includes noise removal [39] and signal pro-
cessing as described in [40] and [41]. Localized regions
of interest referred to as “hits” are then identiﬁed and
ﬁt to Gaussian pulses. The collection of these hits and
their characteristics such as readout time, wire chan-
nel number, and integrated charge are then used as in-
put to the Pandora pattern recognition framework for
further processing [42]. The Pandora framework clus-
ters and matches hits across three 2D projected views
of the MicroBooNE active TPC volume to form 3D re-
constructed objects. These objects are then classiﬁed as
track-like or shower-like based on a multivariate classi-
ﬁer score and aggregated into candidate neutrino inter-
actions. Pandora also reconstructs a candidate neutrino
interaction vertex based on the position and orientation
of the reconstructed tracks and showers which represents
the most likely position of the neutrino interaction.

Being a surface detector, MicroBooNE is subject to a
constant stream of high-energy cosmic rays impinging on
the detector that substantially outnumber the neutrino
interactions and form the largest background to candi-
date neutrino interactions. To incorporate the eﬀect of
cosmic-ray contamination in the simulation, cosmic ray
data recorded in situ at MicroBooNE, when the beam

is not present, are used as overlays (at the wire sig-
nal waveform level) to simulated neutrino interactions.
During the 2.3 ms that it takes to “drift” ionization
charge associated with neutrino interaction ﬁnal states
across the maximum 2.56 m drift distance, O(10) cos-
mic rays are expected to enter the detector. In order to
reduce this cosmic-ray contamination, scintillation light
recorded by the MicroBooNE photo-detector system is
matched to candidate neutrino interactions during recon-
struction and is also required to occur in time with the
1.6 µs long BNB neutrino spill.

To select a high-purity sample of BNB neutrino NC
1π0 interactions, a series of topological, pre-selection,
and boosted decision tree (BDT)-based selections are ap-
plied. This results in two mutually exclusive ﬁnal selec-
tion topologies: 2γ1p, which targets two photons and
one proton in the ﬁnal state, and 2γ0p, which targets
two photons and zero protons in the ﬁnal state. The
diﬀerent selection stages are described below, along with
the details of the systematic uncertainty evaluation.

A. Topological Selection and Pre-Selection

The event selection begins with topology-based crite-
ria for candidate neutrino interactions identiﬁed by Pan-
dora and targets two mutually exclusive topological def-
initions: (a) two showers and one track (2γ1p), and (b)
two showers and zero tracks (2γ0p). The two showers
correspond to the photons expected from π0 decay. The
presence of a track corresponds to a reconstructed pro-
ton exiting the nucleus while the zero-track case suggests
either a low-energy proton that is not reconstructed or
no charged hadrons at all exiting the nucleus.

Once events with the desired signal topologies are iden-
tiﬁed, a series of loose “pre-selection” requirements is ap-
plied to reduce obvious backgrounds or mis-reconstructed
events. These pre-selection requirements include shower
energy thresholds of 30 MeV for the leading shower and
20 MeV for the subleading shower in both topologies.
The pre-selection also requires that the reconstructed
neutrino interaction point be contained in a ﬁducial vol-
ume, deﬁned as at least 5 cm away from any TPC wall, in
order to help reduce the number of selected events with
tracks that exit the detector. For the 2γ1p topology,
the non-zero conversion distance of photons is explicitly
used by requiring that each shower has a reconstructed
start point of at least 1 cm from the reconstructed neu-
trino interaction vertex. Typically the reconstructed neu-
trino interaction vertex is identiﬁed as the start of the re-
constructed proton candidate track. In order to remove
a very small number of poorly reconstructed events in
which the candidate track is not consistent with the hy-
pothesis of originating from the candidate neutrino inter-
action vertex, a requirement is placed to ensure the track
start point is always within 10 cm of the reconstructed
neutrino interaction vertex. The eﬃciency of selecting
NC 1π0 + 0 (1)p events using these pre-selection require-

4

ments is 21.5% (19.9%). Note that the eﬃciency of the 1p
selection is lower because of the additional requirements
placed on the track reconstruction.

B. Boosted Decision Tree-Based Selection

After applying the pre-selection requirements, the
remaining signal and background are further diﬀerenti-
ated and separated using two tailored BDTs trained on
simulation. The gradient boosting algorithm XGBoost
[43] is used to train each of the BDTs. They take as
input various reconstructed kinematic, geometric, and
calorimetric variables both for the signal (deﬁned as
an NC interaction with identically one π0 in the ﬁnal
state) and for the background interactions. Because the
two tailored BDTs target diﬀerent topologies, notably
including one track in the case of 2γ1p and zero tracks in
the case of 2γ0p, the signal deﬁnitions used for the two
BDTs are slightly diﬀerent. NC π0 events with exactly
one proton with true kinetic energy above 20 MeV are
used as the training signal for the 2γ1p BDT while
NC π0 events with no protons with true kinetic energy
above 20 MeV are used as the training signal for the
2γ0p BDT. We note that the 20 MeV threshold used
in the BDT training is lower than the 50 MeV proton
kinetic energy threshold used later during cross-section
extraction, as during training we are aiming to push the
threshold as low as possible. Each BDT is trained on
ten reconstructed variables. Due to the existence of a
proton candidate track in the 2γ1p sample, these ten
variables diﬀer for each BDT. They are listed below.

Variables used in both 2γ1p and 2γ0p BDTs:

• Leading and subleading shower impact parame-
ters: The perpendicular distance between the back-
projection of the reconstructed shower and the can-
didate neutrino interaction point which is a metric
of how well each shower “points” back to the re-
constructed neutrino interaction point.

• Leading and subleading shower conversion dis-
tances: Deﬁned as the distance between the re-
constructed start of the shower and reconstructed
neutrino interaction point.

• Reconstructed energy of the leading shower.

Variables used in only the 2γ1p BDT:

• Reconstructed track length.

• Reconstructed track vertical angle: Deﬁned as the
arctangent of the track direction in the vertical
plane with respect to the beam axis.

• Distance from track end to TPC wall: Calculated
as the shortest distance to the closest TPC wall.

• Reconstructed mean energy deposition per unit

length (dE/dx) of the track.

• Ratio of dE/dx of the ﬁrst half of track to that of
the second half of the track: A metric for identi-
fying stopping proton tracks that contain a Bragg
peak.

Variables used in only the 2γ0p BDT:

• Reconstructed energy of the subleading shower.

• Leading and subleading shower geometric length
per unit energy: The ratio of each shower’s geo-
metric length to its reconstructed energy. The ge-
ometric length is an estimate of the 3D extent of
the electromagnetic shower.

• Pandora “neutrino score”: A multivariate classiﬁer
in the Pandora reconstruction suite which scores all
reconstructed neutrino candidates based on their
geometric and kinematic features as to how likely a
candidate is due to a neutrino interaction or cosmic
in origin.

• Reconstructed leading shower vertical angle: Direc-
tion in the vertical plane with respect to the beam
axis.

By construction, BDT scores lie on the interval of [0,
1]. After training, the resulting BDT score distributions,
tested on a statistically independent simulation and data
set, are shown in Fig. 1. The simulation and data points
agree across the full range of BDT classiﬁer score within
systematic and statistical uncertainties (the deﬁnition of
these systematic uncertainties is described in detail in
Sec. II C). The bimodal distribution of the 2γ1p BDT re-
sponse indicates greater separation power between signal
and background compared to that for 2γ0p because the
addition of the reconstructed track gives access to an en-
tirely separate handle on background rejection. For this
and subsequent MC simulation comparisons to data, the
simulation predictions are broken down into the following
eight categories, based on genie truth-level information:
• NC 1π0: All neutral current interactions that pro-
duce one exiting π0 regardless of incoming neu-
trino ﬂavor. This is our targeted signal selection,
and it is further split into two sub-categories, “NC
1π0 Coherent” and “NC 1π0 Non-Coherent” con-
tributions, based on their interaction types. Non-
Coherent scattering occurs when a neutrino inter-
acts with a nucleon inside the argon nucleus, poten-
tially knocking out one or more nucleons. In coher-
ent scattering the neutrino interacts with the nu-
cleus as a whole, leaving it in its ground state. This
interactions occurs with low momentum-transfer,
and as such the resulting π0 tends to be very for-
ward relative to the incoming neutrino beam.

• NC ∆ → N γ: Leading Standard Model source of
NC single-photon production below 1 GeV origi-
nating from radiative decay of the ∆(1232) baryon.

5

• CC νµ1π0: All νµ CC interactions that have one

true exiting π0.

• CC νe/νe Intrinsic: All CC νe or νe interactions
regardless of whether or not a π0 was emitted.

• BNB Other: All remaining BNB neutrino interac-
tions that take place in the active TPC volume of
MicroBooNE and are not covered by the above ﬁve
categories, such as multiple π0 events and η meson
decay. See section II F for more details.

• Dirt (Outside TPC): All BNB neutrino interac-
tions that take place outside the MicroBooNE ac-
tive TPC but have ﬁnal states that enter and inter-
act inside the active TPC detector. This can origi-
nate from scattering oﬀ liquid argon in the cryostat
vessel outside the active TPC volume or from in-
teractions in the concrete and “dirt” surrounding
the cryostat itself.

• Cosmic Data: Coincident cosmic ray interactions
that take place during a BNB spill but without any
true neutrino interaction present.

The ﬁnal NC 1π0-enriched samples are selected by
placing a requirement on the BDT score distribution that
maximizes the product of NC 1π0 signal eﬃciency and
purity. This corresponds to a threshold on the BDT
scores of > 0.854 and > 0.950 for 2γ1p and 2γ0p, respec-
tively. The ﬁnal distributions are provided and discussed
in Sec. II E.

C. Systematic Uncertainty Evaluation

Systematic uncertainties on the MC simulation pre-
diction include contributions from uncertainties in the
neutrino ﬂux, the cross-section modeling, hadron re-
interactions, detector eﬀects, and the eﬀect of ﬁnite
statistics used in the background predictions (both sim-
ulations and cosmic ray data).

The ﬂux systematic uncertainties incorporate hadron
production uncertainties where the Booster proton beam
hits the beryllium target, uncertainties on pion and nu-
cleon scattering in the target and surrounding aluminum
magnetic focusing horn of the BNB, and mismodeling of
the horn current. Following [44], these are implemented
by reweighting the ﬂux prediction according to neutrino
type, parentage, and energy, and studying the propa-
gated eﬀects on the ﬁnal event distributions.

The cross-section uncertainties incorporate modeling
uncertainties on the genie prediction [29–31], evaluated
by genie reweighting tools. The default genie uncer-
tainties on NC resonant production arising from NC
resonant vector and axial mass parameters of mV =
0.840 ± 0.084 GeV and mA = 1.120 ± 0.224 GeV, respec-
tively, were assumed. genie uses an eﬀective cascade em-
pirical model for hadronic ﬁnal-state interactions, called

fect on ﬁnal distributions. For more information on cross-
section uncertainties in MicroBooNE, please see [29].

The hadron-argon reinteraction uncertainties are as-
sociated with the propagation of hadrons through the
detector, as modeled in geant4 [37]. Both charged
pions and proton reinteractions during propagation
were considered and their impact estimated using the
geant4reweight tool [45].

The detector modeling and response uncertainties are
evaluated using MicroBooNE’s novel data-driven tech-
nique for assessing and propagating LArTPC detector-
related systematic uncertainties [46]. This approach uses
in situ measurements of distortions in the TPC wire
readout waveform signals – caused by detector eﬀects
such as electron diﬀusion, electron drift lifetime, elec-

tric ﬁeld, and the electronics response – to parameterize
these eﬀects at the TPC wire level. This provides a de-
tector model-agnostic way to study and evaluate their
eﬀects on the high level variables and, subsequently, the
ﬁnal event distributions. Additional detector systematics
corresponding to variations in the charge recombination
model, the scintillation light yield, and space charge ef-
fects [47, 48] are separately evaluated and also included.

D. Shower Energy Calibration

Electromagnetic shower reconstruction in LArTPCs
is known to be a lossy process primarily due to mis-
clustering and thresholding eﬀects. Current reconstruc-
tion algorithms often miss small,
low-energy hits in
an electromagnetic shower when clustering objects, and
some of the hits that are reconstructed may fall below the
energy threshold. On average, these eﬀects are expected
to yield shower energy losses of approximately 20% [49].
This can be seen in Fig. 2 where the reconstructed shower
energy falls systematically below the true shower energy
in simulation. By performing a linear ﬁt to the most
probable values of reconstructed shower energy in bins
of true shower energy, shown as the pink straight line
in Fig. 2, a correction factor is extracted which brings
the reconstructed values closer to expectation. This ﬁt
results in an energy correction that is applied to all re-
constructed showers,

Ecorr = (1.21 ± 0.03)Ereco + (9.88 ± 4.86) MeV,

and represents a correction of approximately 20%, as ex-
pected.

the analysis are provided in Table I, and the total eﬃ-
ciency for each selection is shown as a function of (a)
true π0 momentum and (b) true proton kinetic energy
in Fig. 3. Overall, the 1p selection is more eﬃcient and
of higher signal purity relative to the 0p selection due
to the existence of a reconstructed particle track which
greatly helps to tag the neutrino interaction point and
reject backgrounds. This track information, particularly
track calorimetry, provides an additional handle on the
neutrino interaction mode; a proton-like track is highly
indicative of an NC 1π0 interaction whereas CC interac-
tions generally have a muon track in the ﬁnal state.

2γ0p and 2γ1p selections which was subsequently cho-

After applying the BDT requirements, 1130 selected
data events remain with 634 and 496 falling into the
2γ1p and 2γ0p selections, respectively. For the 2γ1p se-
lection, the BDT score requirement eﬃciency is 85.6%
and the purity is 63.5% while for the 2γ0p selection, the
eﬃciency and purity are 58.8% and 52.9%, respectively.
The 2γ1p and 2γ0p BDT selection eﬃciencies and puri-
ties are both calculated relative to their signal deﬁnition,

direction of the two photon candidate showers as

γγ = 2Eγ1Eγ2(1 − cos θγγ),

(3)

where cos θγγ is the opening angle between the two show-
ers. For the 2γ1p case where a track has been identiﬁed
as a candidate proton, the directions of the showers and
thus the opening angle between them are calculated by
constructing the direction between the candidate neu-
trino interaction point and the shower start point. For
the 2γ0p selection, however, no such candidate track ex-
ists. Instead, the shower direction and opening angle are
entirely estimated from the geometric shape of the show-
ers themselves.

A Gaussian-plus-linear ﬁt is performed to each ob-
served distribution in data to extract the reconstructed
π0 invariant mass while taking into account the non-
π0 background contamination. For the 2γ1p event sam-
ple, this ﬁt gives a Gaussian mean of 138.9±2.1 MeV/c2
with a width of 31.7±2.4 MeV/c2. For the 2γ0p event
sample, the corresponding ﬁt gives a Gaussian mean of
143.3±3.2 MeV/c2 with a width of 47.9±4.9 MeV/c2. As
a goodness-of-ﬁt test, the resulting χ2 per degree of free-
dom is 1.20 and 1.45 for the 2γ1p and 2γ0p ﬁts, respec-
tively. These both show agreement with the expected
invariant mass of the π0 of 134.9770 ± 0.0005 MeV/c2
[50] giving conﬁdence and validation of the calorimetric
energy reconstruction of the showers. Additional distri-
butions showing the reconstructed π0 momentum as well
as the reconstructed angle of the outgoing π0 with respect
to the incoming neutrino beam are provided in Fig. 5.

Two additional reconstructed distributions of interest
are highlighted. First, the reconstructed cosine of the
center-of-mass (CM) decay angle is shown in Fig. 6. This
is deﬁned as the angle between the lab-frame π0 momen-
tum direction and the decay axis of the two daughter
photons in the CM frame,

cos θCM =

|Eγ1 − Eγ2|
|pπ0|

.

(4)

This quantity should be an isotropic ﬂat distribution for
true π0 → γγ signal events, and any deviation from

8

this can highlight regions of ineﬃciency in reconstruc-
tion or selection. As can be seen in Fig. 6, for both
2γ1p and 2γ0p selections, the distributions taper oﬀ at
high cos θCM which corresponds to increasingly asymmet-
ric π0 decays. When reconstructing asymmetric π0 de-
cay events, it is more likely that the subleading photon
shower is missed due to its low energy. Note, however,
that the observed data show the same trend as the sim-
ulation within uncertainty.

Figure 7 additionally highlights the reconstructed pho-
ton conversion distance for all showers in the ﬁnal 2γ1p
selection. Well-reconstructed showers with conversion
distances as far as 100 cm from the candidate neutrino
interaction are observed. This helps validate the assump-
tion that the reconstructed showers are indeed likely to
be true photons as O(100) MeV photons are expected to
have a mean free path in argon of ≈ 20 cm. Note that, as
the 2γ0p selection does not have any visible hadronic ac-
tivity for tagging the interaction point, the corresponding
conversion distance is signiﬁcantly harder to estimate.

Finally, Fig. 8 shows two example event displays of se-
lected events in data for both the 2γ1p and 2γ0p topolo-
gies. Each event shows two well-reconstructed showers
pointing back to a common interaction point with prop-
erties consistent with those being photons from a π0 de-
cay.

F. Background Discussion and Validation

In order to validate the background modelling in this
analysis we developed a background rich sideband selec-
tion by inverting the BDT score cuts shown in Fig. 1.
This gives us a high statistics sample of “CC1π0” and
“BNB Other” background categories with which to com-
pare to data.
In addition to inverting the BDT score
an additional cosmic rejection cut, where we require the
Pandora neutrino score to be > 0.5, is applied to provide
a higher purity of the backgrounds we wish to study.
These distributions are shown in Fig. 9a and 9b for
2γ1p and 2γ0p respectively. This is particularly useful
for 2γ1p inverted selection as the resulting spectrum is
rich in CC1π0 for higher reconstructed π0 momenta, and
richer in “BNB Other” at low momenta. For the 2γ0p
background rich sample there is still a signiﬁcant amount
of rejected NC π0 signal events, but the enhanced back-
grounds still provide additional validation. The data is
observed to be in good agreement with the prediction,
within assigned uncertainties, with a χ2/ndof of 24.61/20
and 17.49/22 for 2γ1p and 2γ0p respectively. This gives
us conﬁdence that the backgrounds and uncertainties are
suﬃciently modelled for a cross-section extraction to pro-
ceed.

We can also break down the “BNB Other” category
further in order to improve our understanding of this im-
portant background. We ﬁnd that approximately 75% of
“BNB Other” events contain true photons reconstructed,
and in case of 2γ1p 84% have true protons reconstructed.

beam ((c) and (d)) for both the 2γ1p ((a) and (c)) and 2γ0p ((b) and (d)) ﬁnal selected data. The prediction shows
agreement with the observed data within assigned uncertainties for the ranges shown, although a systematic deﬁcit
is observed in the total event rates as is discussed in Sec. III.

This indicates that despite being a background category
the BDT’s are indeed selecting events with a very high
purity of true photons and protons, as is the target of the
selection. The approximate breakdown of “BNB Other”
after applying the BDT cuts is found to be

• ≈ 25% are events in which multiple π0 are exiting
the nucleus but only 1 π0 is reconstructed correctly,

• ≈ 25% are events in which no π0 exits the nucleus
but due to baryon or charged pion re-scattering in
the argon, a π0 is subsequently created and recon-
structed,

• ≈ 25% are events in which there is no π0 and a NC
proton is reconstructed as the track with cosmic
contamination resulting in a 2γ event mimicking a
π0,

• ≈ 20% are events containing a NC η → γγ decay
event. These are generally rejected due to them
having higher energies, but a small number are
selected as they are topologically identical to the
π0 → γγ decay signal,

• ≈ 5% Miscellaneous other reconstruction failures,
representing less than 1% of total background
events.

In the case of CC1π0 we see a similar situation, with
97.3% (98.1%) of 2γ1p (2γ0p) background events having
at least 1 shower matched to a true π0 and with 78% of
tracks in the 2γ1p sample being correctly matched to a
proton. As such, the vast majority of these events have
the correct target particle content, but rather the muon
itself is missed. This primarily occurs when the muon
is incorrectly clustered into a photon electro-magnetic
shower due to close proximity, or when the muon is

muon, with the associated π0 then being reconstructed
as an isolated neutrino event.

III. NC π0 RATE VALIDATION

NC 1π0 events contribute as a dominant background to
NC single-photon production measurements carried out
or planned by MicroBooNE such as searches for NC ∆
radiative decay [4], NC coherent single-photon produc-
tion, or more rare e+e− pair production motivated in
BSM theories. In addition to using these selected events
as a calibration sample for understanding and validating
shower reconstruction performance, they are also used to
validate the observed overall rate of this process as cur-
rently modeled with genie. Assuming genie provides
a suﬃcient description of the observed data, this sample
can and has been used to provide an in situ constraint
on NC 1π0 mis-identiﬁed backgrounds, e.g. as in [4]. Al-

FIG. 7: The reconstructed conversion distance of both
photons in the 2γ1p ﬁnal selection. There are well-
reconstructed showers with conversion distances as far
as 100 cm from the candidate neutrino interaction.

ternatively, these measurements can be used to increase
our understanding of our current NC π0 modelling and
potentially motivate genie tuning.

As shown in Fig. 5, both the 2γ1p and the 2γ0p se-
lections see an overall deﬁcit in data relative to the MC
prediction. This is more pronounced in the 2γ1p selection
where the ratio of the number of selected data events to
the number of selected simulated events is 0.79. As it is
also known that the genie branching fraction of coherent
NC 1π0 production on argon is signiﬁcantly lower than
expectation extrapolated from MiniBooNE’s π0 measure-
ment on mineral oil [23], the possibility of a correction
to genie predictions on both non-coherent and coher-
ent NC 1π0 production is explicitly examined. The MC
predictions are ﬁtted to data allowing both coherent and
non-coherent NC 1π0 rates to vary. Both normalization-
only and normalization plus shape variations to the co-
herent and non-coherent rates are explored; all yield sim-
ilar conclusions. This section describes the normalization
plus shape variation ﬁt in detail.

The normalization plus shape variation ﬁt is performed
as a function of reconstructed π0 momentum for both
2γ1p and 2γ0p selections, using [0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.225,
0.3, 0.375, 0.45, 0.525, 0.6, 0.675, and 0.9] GeV/c bin lim-
its. In the ﬁt, MC predicted coherent NC 1π0 events are
scaled by a normalization factor Ncoh, and MC predicted
non-coherent NC 1π0 events are scaled on an event-by-
event basis depending on their corresponding true π0 mo-
mentum according to (a + b|(cid:126)p true
|), where the true π0
momentum is given in [GeV/c]. This linear scaling as
a function of π0 momentum was chosen because it was
the simplest implementation that was consistent with the
observed data-to-MC deﬁcit, as observed in Fig. 5a.

use of a covariance matrix including statistical and sys-
tematic uncertainties and correlations corresponding to
the scaled prediction. Flux, cross section, detector and
geant4 systematic uncertainties are included in the ﬁt
including bin-to-bin systematic correlations. As the goal
of the ﬁt is to extract the normalization and scaling pa-
rameters of the coherent and non-coherent NC 1π0 rates,
the cross-section normalization uncertainties of coherent
and non-coherent NC 1π0 are not included. Note that
the cross-section normalization uncertainties of coherent
and non-coherent NC 1π0 are only removed for the pur-
poses of this ﬁt and not for the cross section extraction
described in the following section.

The data-extracted best-ﬁt parameters correspond to

ters of the non-coherent NC 1π0 events, and Ncoh = 2.6
for the NC coherent π0 normalization factor with no en-
hancement, Ncoh = 1, being allowed within the 1σ error
bands. This best-ﬁt gives a χ2 per degree of freedom

(CV) prediction is 13.74/20 yielding a ∆χ2 between the
genie CV and the best-ﬁt point of 5.28 for 3 dof . Al-
though the goodness-of-ﬁt χ2/dof values for both scenar-
ios are acceptable due to the generally large uncertain-
ties, the momentum-dependent shift is preferred over the
genie CV at the 1.43σ level. The 1D marginalized ∆χ2
distributions in Fig. 10 also conﬁrm that the genie CV
prediction agrees with data within uncertainty. The data
and MC comparisons of the reconstructed π0 momentum
distributions scaled to the best-ﬁt parameters are pro-
vided in Fig. 11 and, compared to those corresponding
to the genie CV, show better agreement with data after
the ﬁt.

nie prediction of NC 1π0s is accurate within uncertainty.
This validates the approach of using the measured NC
1π0 event rate as a powerful in situ constraint of ge-
nie-predicted NC 1π0 backgrounds as in [4]. We stress
that while this result motivates a momentum dependent
shift in how we model our NC π0 events, we do not apply
this change to our modeling, relying instead on the fact
that the assigned uncertainty covers the observed discrep-
ancy. Future work will investigate further the possibility
of tuning genie with results such as these to obtain bet-
ter model predictions. On the other hand, it is natural to
extract a data-driven NC 1π0 cross-section on argon us-
ing these selections, and compare to a number of neutrino
event generators, including genie. This is described be-
low.

INCLUSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE NC 1π0
CROSS-SECTIONS ON ARGON

A. Methodology

The prescription for calculating the cross section is
provided in Eq. (5) where the components are deﬁned
as follows: N obs
N C1π0, Ncosmic, and Nbkg denote the num-
ber of selected data events, the number of background
events arising from cosmic rays traversing the detector,
and the number of expected beam-correlated background
events, respectively; (cid:15)N C1π0 denotes the eﬃciency of se-

(b) 2γ0p selections, as a function of reconstructed π0
momentum. Monte Carlo predictions at the central
value and at the best-ﬁt point (Ncoh = 2.6, a = 0.98,
b = −1.0 [c/GeV]) are both shown, with prediction and
corresponding systematic error evaluated at the ge-
nie central value in salmon, and at the best-ﬁt in blue.
Note that the systematic uncertainties on the plot in-
clude MC intrinsic statistical error and all the system-

each case one or zero protons is explicitly required in
the signal deﬁnition (described in detail below). Addi-
tionally, the calculation is performed using the combined
2γ(0+1)p selection to measure a semi-inclusive cross sec-
tion, NCπ0, with no requirement on the number of pro-
tons in the signal deﬁnition. Note that this semi-inclusive
measurement is eﬃciency-corrected to include 2+ proton
ﬁnal states that are not included in the ﬁnal selected
events (11% of the total number of NC π0 interactions,
per GENIE). As noted in Section II C, the simulation
is run multiple times to encompass the eﬀect of varying
underlying sources of systematic uncertainty. The cal-
culation of each cross section is performed separately in
each of these systematic “universes” to guarantee that
all correlations between components of the cross section
are handled correctly. This is done using tools from the
MINERvA Analysis Toolkit [52].

Both selections, as well as their combination, corre-
spond to approximately, but not identically, the same
POT, provided in Table II (due to diﬀerences in the com-
putational processing of the two samples). To extract the
semi-inclusive cross section from the combined 2γ(0+1)p
selection, the relevant 2γ0p distributions are scaled down
by the ratio between the POT of the 2γ1p data sample
(smaller POT) and the POT of the 2γ0p data sample
and then are added to the 2γ1p distributions. This op-
eration is performed for N obs
N C1π0, Ncosmic, Nbkg, and the
numerator of the eﬃciency.

N obs

N C1π0 and Ncosmic are measured in data and there-
fore there is no systematic uncertainty attributed to
them. These values are reported in Table II. Nbkg is
extracted from the simulation, and we note that many
of the key backgrounds in this analysis are shared with
MicroBooNE’s search for NC ∆ radiative decay [4]. The
dominant contributions to the uncertainty on the back-
ground event rate for each analysis are from FSI re-
lated to inelastic nucleon scattering, pion and nucleon
absorption, and pion charge-exchange. The axial and
vector mass parameters, mA and mV , respectively, in the
charged current resonant form factors are also sources of
signiﬁcant uncertainties; this is consistent with expec-
tation because of the large background due to charged-
current interactions in which a π0 is produced.

The eﬃciency of the selection is constructed using as
the numerator the number of signal events passing all re-
construction cuts and analysis BDTs in simulation and
as the denominator the total number of signal events pre-
ceding the application of any cuts or analysis BDTs. The
diﬀerence in signal deﬁnition between the semi-inclusive
measurement and each of the two exclusive measure-
ments is contained in the eﬃciency denominator. The
exclusive measurements and the semi-inclusive measure-
ment each use a distinct eﬃciency denominator, reﬂect-
ing the total number of simulated events truly satisfying
the corresponding signal deﬁnition. In each of the exclu-
sive measurements, the signal deﬁnition is taken to be
NC1π0 with exactly zero or one ﬁnal-state proton with a

13

kinetic energy above 50 MeV. In the semi-inclusive mea-
surement, the signal deﬁnition is taken to be NC1π0,
notably allowing for any number of protons in the ﬁ-
nal state. The eﬃciency for each analysis is reported in
Table II.

The integrated ﬂux is calculated separately for all four
neutrino species (νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe), and the sum of these
integrated ﬂuxes is used to normalize each cross section
measurement. This choice was made because of the in-
ability to identify the species of the incident neutrino
based on the neutral current ﬁnal state. The integrated
ﬂux is varied within each ﬂux systematic “universe”, and
the correlations between each varied ﬂux and the corre-
sponding variations in the predicted background and ef-
ﬁciency are taken into account when extracting the cross
sections.

The number of argon atoms used is calculated as
Ntargets = ρV NA/MAr, where V = 5.64 × 107cm3 is the
ﬁducial volume of the analysis, ρ = 1.3954 g/cm3 is the
density of argon at the temperature in the cryostat, and
MAr = 39.948 g/mol is the molar mass of argon. A 1%
uncertainty is assigned to the number of targets to reﬂect
variation in the argon density through temperature and
pressure ﬂuctuations.

B. Results and Interpretation

The calculation of each cross section from its compo-
nents follows from Eq. (5) and is summarized in Table II.
The resulting cross sections are shown in Fig. 12, com-
pared to the simulated cross sections from several neu-
trino event generators including genie, NuWro [53],
and neut [54]. NEUT and GENIE both use the Berger-
Sehgal model as their foundation for modeling pion pro-
duction in the ∆(1232) resonance region, while NuWro
implements a custom model optimized for the ∆ reso-
nance peak region. The complete details of the mod-
els used in each generator are discussed at length in
Ref. [55]. The genie curve shown is generated using
the MicroBooNE cross-section “tune” [29], which does
not modify the genie v3.0.6 central value prediction (be-
cause the tune did not adjust the NC interaction model),
but does deﬁne the uncertainty on the prediction. The
error bars on the data points include systematic error
associated with the modeling of background events that
enters into the cross-sections via background subtraction
as well as error associated with the modeling of the sig-
nal events that enters into the cross-sections via eﬃciency
correction. The shaded band around the GENIE central
value prediction shows the error associated with the pre-
diction of the signal cross section.

We observe a consistent deﬁcit in data compared to
genie for the combined semi-inclusive measurement and
for each of the individual NCπ0+1p and NCπ0+0p ex-
clusive measurements. Overall, the neut predictions
most closely match the reported measurements across
semi-inclusive and exclusive ﬁnal states. Additionally

Note that while the individual errors on the components are given here, the full uncertainty on the cross section is
calculated properly assuming full correlations.

we note that while NuWro is generally consistent with
the other generators in its semi-inclusive and exclusive
1p predictions, its exclusive 0p prediction is higher com-
pared to neut and genie predictions. The extracted
semi-inclusive NCπ0 cross section is 1.24 ± 0.19 (syst) ±
0.08 (stat) [10−38cm2/Ar] which is 26% lower than the
genie prediction of 1.68 [10−38cm2/Ar]. We calculate a
χ2 test statistic comparing our data measurement with
full uncertainties to the CV of each model prediction for
both exclusive NCπ0+0p and NCπ0+1p cross sections
simultaneously (i.e.
two degrees of freedom). The re-
sulting values are 7.6, 7.7, 2.4, and 5.1 for comparisons
against genie v3, genie v2, neut, and NuWro, respec-
tively.

The corresponding breakdown of uncertainty for each
of the measurement channels is shown in Fig. 13. In all
cases the ﬂux, genie, and statistical uncertainties are
dominant. The dominant contributions to the genie un-
certainties enter into the cross section via the background
subtraction and, as noted above, arise from the modeling
of ﬁnal-state interactions and the axial and vector mass
parameters governing CC resonant pion production.

To further understand this measurement, it is instruc-
tive to compare it to previous experimental measure-
ments of NCπ0 production. We compare our measure-
ment to that performed by MiniBooNE which operated
in the same beamline as MicroBooNE but which utilized
a diﬀerent detector material (mineral oil, CH2) as the
neutrino scattering target. In MiniBooNE’s NC π0 anal-
ysis, they measured NC interactions wherein only one
π0 and no additional mesons exited the target nucleus
(no requirement on the number or identity of outgoing
nucleons was made). A ﬁnal ﬂux-averaged cross section
of 4.76 ± 0.76 ± 0.05 [10−40cm2/nucleon] was reported
[25]. We can compare this result to our semi-inclusive re-
sult by comparing each to the same neutrino generator.
This is shown in Fig. 14 where we compare both to the
default GENIE v3.0.6 on argon and mineral oil respec-
tively. We observe that while this result on argon lies

sive NCπ0+1p, and exclusive NCπ0+0p cross sec-
tions, each compared to the corresponding genie
v3 (G18 10a 02 11) cross section and its uncertainty
(shaded red bands) as well as other contemporary neu-
trino generators. Inner error bars on data points are
statistical only; outer are statistical and systematic,
summed in quadrature.

slightly below the expected central value, both our re-
sult and MiniBooNE’s agree with GENIE v3.0.6 within
assigned uncertainties.

V. SUMMARY

In summary, we report the highest statistics measure-
ment to date of neutrino neutral current single pion
production on argon, including the ﬁrst exclusive mea-
surements of this process ever made in argon. These
cross sections are measured using the MicroBooNE detec-
tor exposed to the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beamline,

to contributions to this process from coherent and non-
coherent pion production and suggest that, given the cur-
rently analyzed MicroBooNE data statistics, the nominal
genie neutrino event generator used for MicroBooNE
Monte Carlo modeling describes the observed distribu-
tions within uncertainties. This has provided an impor-
tant validation check justifying the use of this sample as
a powerful constraint for backgrounds to single-photon
searches in MicroBooNE, e.g. in [4].

Using a total of 1,130 observed NC π0 events, a ﬂux-
averaged cross section has been extracted for neutrinos
with a mean energy of 804 MeV and has been found to
correspond to 1.243 ± 0.185 (syst) ±0.076 (stat), 0.444 ±
0.098±0.047, and 0.624±0.131±0.075 [10−38cm2/Ar] for
the semi-inclusive NCπ0, exclusive NCπ0+1p, and exclu-
sive NCπ0+0p processes compared to 1.678, 0.722, and
0.774 [10−38cm2/Ar] in the default genie prediction used
by MicroBooNE. Comparison to other generators includ-
ing neut and NuWro show reasonable agreement with
the neut predictions found to be slightly more consis-
tent with the MicroBooNE data-extracted cross-section
for all three exclusive and semi-inclusive processes.
