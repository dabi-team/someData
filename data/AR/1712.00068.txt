1. Introduction 

One of the most important radiation safety problems associated with the design and operation of 
high-power high-energy accelerators and their experiments is the release of radioactive gases into 
the atmosphere.  In particular, 41Ar with a relatively long half-life of 110 minutes is radiologically 
significant  for  off-site  doses.  One  of  the  most  challenging  examples  is  neutrino  experiments  – 
planned  (LBNF/DUNE)  [1]  and  operational  (NuMI/NOvA)  [2]  –  with  their  120-GeV  proton, 
Megawatt scale beam power on target. To predict the air activation levels for a new facility, when 
direct measurements are not yet available, a combination of calculations and measurements from 
a similar existing facility are used. As an example, one can use measurements at the NuMI beam 
line,  which  has  been  operating  at  Fermilab  for  many  years,  to  benchmark  calculations  used  to 
predict air activation at future facilities.  This paper describes measurements of the radionuclides 
production rates in the NuMI target chase and compares them with MARS15 calculations. 

Once a beam line or experimental facility starts operations, the air composition at the release points 
is analyzed and quantified to get an actual release estimate. However, before the operation of a 
beam line starts, an estimate of the levels radioactive gas emissions is needed as an input to the 
design  of  the  facility.    Contemporary  Monte  Carlo  codes  such  as  MARS15  [3]  provide  quite 
reliable predictions for a wide range of physical quantities. Benchmarking such code predictions 
against experimental data provides a very useful information on the range of reliability regarding 
the air activation calculations. This study presents such an effort to measure the production of 41Ar 
and other important isotopes in the target chase at the NuMI beam line and compare the results 
with predictions by the MARS15 code.

When performing the air activation calculations, one faces the following problems: (i) primary and 
secondary particles of various types can contribute to the air activation; (ii) a very wide energy 
range  should  be  taken  into  account  (in  our  case  spanning  14  decades,  from  120  GeV  down  to 
thermal neutron energies); (iii) light target nuclei like oxygen, nitrogen and argon still represent a 
challenge for most of the cascade and evaporation modeling codes.   

The  general-purpose  Monte  Carlo  code  MARS15  allows  modeling  of  particle  and  heavy  ion 
interactions  with  matter  from  a  multi-TeV  region  down  to  thermal  neutron  energies  as  well  as 
spatial transport in arbitrary three-dimensional heterogeneous structures. To improve the quality 
of predictions for air activation levels, two upgrades were recently performed to MARS15 physics 
models:  (i)  production  cross  sections  for  a  number  of  light  target  nuclei  and  most  important 
projectiles were corrected in a very broad energy range; (ii) in the energy range from 1 up to 200 
MeV,  a  completely  new  model  of  nuclear  interactions,  based  on  the  TENDL  library  [4],  was 
implemented for the most important projectiles.     

The experimental and simulation procedures are described in the next two sections followed by 
comparisons between results of these measurements and MARS calculations.  

2. Experimental setup and measurements 

2.1. Experimental setup and air circulation model 

Figure 1 shows a drawing of the NuMI target chase with target and horns, where the air samples 
were taken. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2.  A corresponding fragment of the MARS 
model, that shows the carbon target and the magnetic focusing horn 1 filled with air, is shown in 
Fig. 3.  Downstream of horn 1 there is another horn. The chase is surrounded by shielding, which 
altogether represents the NuMI target pile.  

Fig. 1. A schematic diagram  of the  NuMI  target  pile showing the  120-cm  long  target and two 
focusing horns. This is the volume from which the air samples were taken. More detailed info on 
the target with its supporting structures, horns etc. is provided in Ref. [2] and in Fig. 3 below. The 
AHU refers to an air handling unit for recirculating air. The distance between upstream end of the 
target and AHU is approximately 50 m.

Fig.  2.  A  schematic  drawing  of  the  sampling  and  measuring  configuration.  Activated  air  from 
NuMI target chase was circulated through the sampling containers until the concentration levels 
reached an  equilibrium. The valves shown in  the supply and  exhaust  lines were then closed  to 
isolate the samples before measuring their decay rates, “in situ,” with the two different detector 
types: a High Purity Ge detector (HPGe), and a Geiger-Mueller counter (GM). 

The activated air is circulated through the target chase by means of the target chase cooling system. 
A small amount of air continuously leaks out of the target chase air cooling loop. This leakage is 
taken into account by including an additional effective decay term, λL, which is the ratio of the air 
circulation rate and total air volume (see, e.g., [5, 6]).  For this analysis, a complete air mixing 
model [6] is used.  According to this model, an activated nucleus has the same probability of being 
removed from the region where the air activation and complete mixing occurs, no matter where it 
is  produced.  The master equation for this  model,  which describes  temporal dependence of the 
number of radionuclides in a region of interest, is the following:  

,                                                   (1) 

where Ni is the number of radionuclides of the certain type i in this region, Pi is the radionuclide 
production per proton on target (POT), νp is the properly normalized incident proton rate, and λL 
is the correction to the decay constant, λi, due to the air leak described above.

gas. The arrow represents the incident 120-GeV proton beam.  The dimensions are given in cm. 
Air filled areas are shown in cyan. 

2.2. Analytical description of radionuclides build-up and cool-down 

To  compare  activation  measurements  and  predictions,  we  will  need  to  account  for  actual 
irradiation and cooling temporal profile. Here we will introduce the formulae that are used for this 
purpose. The build-up of radioactive isotopes per unit volume produced during a period of constant 
irradiation is described by the well-known formula: 

                                        (2) 

In Eq. (2) ϕ is the flux of particles produced by projectiles with energy above the corresponding 
threshold.  In the standard methodology employed at Fermilab, this is defined as the flux of hadrons 
with kinetic energy above 30 MeV averaged over the target air volume, V.  This is usually obtained 

5 

11()/11ttbNtVePe 
 
from a MARS simulation in units of particles/cm2/proton and is then scaled to the expected number 
of protons per second.  The target density, ρ, is in units of atoms/cc and σ is the production cross 
section in cm2.  The variable λ is the isotope’s decay constant in units of s-1. 

The first three terms in Equation (2) define the normalized isotope production rate P that measures 
the number of isotopes produced per primary beam proton on target (POT). To calculate the total 
number of isotopes produced one need simply scale the result of the equation by the volume and 
beam rate. Note that if the irradiation time is large with respect to the isotope’s lifetime, it reaches 
a saturation concentration of P/λ and a saturation activity per unit volume equal to the production 
rate, P. 

The reduction during a cool-down period is simply given by the exponential decay formula: 

                                                                   (3) 

Equations (2) and (3) can be combined to determine the isotopes remaining after a sequence of 
irradiation or cool-down periods. This is done by simply adding the number of isotopes produced 
in  each  period  from  1  to  n  weighted  with  cool-down  terms  for  the  earlier  ones  (with  Tk  being 
duration of the kth period): 

                                      (4) 

The  latter  equation  allows  us  to  determine  the  isotope  production  resulting  from  arbitrarily 
complex irradiation scenarios. Of particular interest is the build-up resulting from cyclic irradiation 
with the possibility of some leakage loss during each cycle. If Nc represents the isotopes produced 
in a single cycle of length τ, and (1-f) is the fraction of the total air volume that leaks out each 
cycle then the result after n cycles is described by a geometric series: 

                              (5) 

In our case the air was exposed to two consecutive periods of steady but different beam power 
during the time prior to the measurements described. Moreover, the air circulation in the NuMI 
target chase results in a periodic exposure to beam which consists of an irradiation period while it 
passes through the target and horn regions, followed by a cool-down period while it is passing 
through the remainder of the volume. The production during the irradiation period is also cyclic 
due to the periodic structure of the beam.  

To construct the corresponding build up equation we start with isotope production while the air is 
in contact with the beam. If τp is the length of a beam pulse, and τb is the length of beam cycle then 
the isotope production from a beam pulse is obtained using equation (2):

                                                             (6) 

During the time that the air is exposed to the beam it will be irradiated with a sequence of beam 
pulses. Assuming constant beam power, we can describe the production that occurs each time the 
air passes through the target and horn region by setting Nc = Nb and τ = τb in equation (5) and 
defining τa = n τ as the time during which the air is exposed to beam in an air circulation cycle: 

                                                     (7) 

If τc is the time it takes for the air to circulate once through the entire volume, then the build-up 
over a period of time T is obtained using equation (5) again but this time we set Nc = Na and τ = 
τc. and allow for some constant leak rate f, between exposures: 

                                    (8) 

Finally,  we  use  the  latter  equation  to  combine  the  two  running  periods.  If  T1  is  the  time  spent 
running  at  beam  power  W1  and  T2  is  the  time  spent  running  at  beam  power  W2  then  the  total 
number of isotopes produced is given by the following expression: 

           (9) 

Accuracy  of  the  latter  expression  was  verified  by  means  of  comparisons  with  results  of  an 
independent  computer  modeling  of  certain  build-up  and  cool-down  sequences.  The  agreement 
between  the  modeling  results  and  Eq.  (9)  for  the  full  exposure  scenario,  described  in  the  next 
section, for the most important nuclides—11C, 13N and 41Ar— is 0.5% and better.  

2.3. Data and analysis 

Two independent activated air measurements were made on the air taken from the NuMI target 
chase.  The samples were taken after 14 hours of steady beam running at 308 kW followed by a

3.75-hour period in which the beam was steady at 243 kW.  The total volume of the air in the chase 
is about 5.07×108 cm3 and the circulation rate is 1.18×107 cm3/s.  The air volume in the target and 
horn regions, where most of the air activation takes place, is 8.23×107 cm3.  This leads to the air 
circulation period of 42.96 seconds of which 6.97 seconds are spent in the target and horn volumes 
and nearby where the air is exposed to the incident and produced secondary particles.  The leak 
rate from the total volume was measured to be 1.46×105 cm3/s, which corresponds to a 1.24% loss 
per circulation cycle. The beam pulse length and cycle time, τp and τb, are equal to 8.6×10-6 and 
1.75 seconds, respectively.   

2.3.1. High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector data 
For this measurement, a thin-walled sample container (see Fig. 2) the size of a paint can (3.91x103 
cm3), was connected to the supply and return line. It was then positioned in front of the HPGe at a 
known distance. Both the detector and the thin walled container were shielded with lead bricks. 
First a background measurement with this configuration was taken. Then a sample of the air from 
the target chase was collected, isolated by valving off the outlet and the inlet of the thin-walled 
container simultaneously. The HPGe measures the γ-rays emitted from the decay of radionuclides. 
The γ-rays from  41Ar decays produce a peak in the spectrum at 1293.64 keV whereas the other 
isotopes  commonly  produced  in  the  air,  such  as  11C,  13N  and  15O,  all  produce  a  positron  that 
annihilates to produce a γ-peak at 511 keV.  
The HPGe detector also provided an absolute measurement of the  41Ar activity.  Using various 
correction  factors  to  take  into  account  the  measurement  geometry,  decay  of  radioisotopes  and 
detector efficiency, one can get the measured normalized production rate shown in Section 4.  

2.3.2. Decay rate data 

The decay rate data was obtained by isolating a sample of activated air in a thick-walled container 
(see Fig. 2) and counting the number of radiative decays detected by a thin windowed Geiger-
Mueller  (GM)  inside  the  container,  in  short  intervals  (two  seconds  each)  over  a  period  of 
approximately  140  minutes.    The  data  was  used  to  find  a  composition  of  radionuclides  that 
provides the best fit to the compound decay curve measured.   

3. MARS15 physics model updates and calculations 

3.1. Predictive features of contemporary Monte Carlo codes 

Modern modelling tools—FLUKA  and MARS and, in  some cases, GEANT4—predict  most of 
HEP and radiation quantities quite accurately being in good agreement with experimental data. 
For example, at well-defined conditions, they predict particle production and energy deposition 
within 5-20% compared to measured data, and prompt dose and DPA within 20-30%. At the same 
time,  predictions  of  production  of  nuclides,  their  decay  and  transmutation—in  particular, 
responsible for air activation—are less certain due to:  

•  complexity of the phenomenon with energies ranging from 120 GeV to a fraction of an eV 

• 

for LBNF, 
imperfection of the models and nuclear databases in some energy intervals with data for 
some elements contradicting each other,  

•  uncertainties in geometry, air flow, irradiation/cooling profiles and exact composition of 
all the materials comprising the setup that is crucial for low-energy neutrons with resonant 
structure of cross-sections in the sub-MeV region.  

Therefore, an agreement with 30-50% for nuclide production is considered as very good.

3.2. Radionuclide production on light target nuclei at high energies and thermal neutron energies 

Initial  calculations  performed  with  the  MARS15  code  revealed  that  the  predicted  ratio  of 
production rates of  11C and  13N differs significantly from that measured at similar conditions at 
other accelerators [7, 8].  Therefore, an update to the corresponding physical model was performed 
using the approach developed at CERN specifically for the air activation modeling at high energy 
accelerators [9, 10].  In particular, the production cross sections on light target nuclei and  41Ar 
were obtained  from  available experimental data that were  analyzed,  corrected and extrapolated 
using available systematics. The update was performed for incident protons, neutrons, and charged 
pions at energies from 10 MeV up to 10 TeV, and for neutrons from 14 MeV down to 2×10-4 eV.  
Calculations, performed after the update, revealed that the ratio of production rates of 11C and 13N 
is improved and qualitatively agrees with the ratios measured at other accelerators. As an example, 
the production cross section of 13N on oxygen nuclei is shown in Fig. 4.

nuclei for incident protons. The triangles, circles and squares correspond to data from Refs. [11], 
[12] and [13], respectively. The histogram is from Ref. [9].  

3.3. Event generator improvement for 1-200 MeV projectiles 

This  development  was  motivated  by  the  poor  performance  of  intra-nuclear  cascade  and 
evaporation  models  (CEM  and  LAQGSM  [14-15]  in  the  MARS15  case)  at  projectile  energies 
below a few tens of MeV (see Fig. 5). This typically resulted in an underestimation of low-energy 
neutron  fluxes  and,  consequently,  41Ar  production.    A  new  inclusive/exclusive  nuclear  event 
generator based on the  TENDL library [4] was created and implemented in  the MARS15 base 
event generator at incident energies below 200 MeV for protons, neutrons, deuterons, tritons, 3He, 
4He and gammas as projectiles. A mix-and-match procedure was applied to smooth the transition 
to  the  CEM  and  LAQGSM  models  used  above  100  MeV.  Various  comparisons  between  the 
calculations and experimental data reveal a very good agreement (see Figs. 5-7).

secondary protons for light, medium and heavy target nuclei (projectile and ejectile energies, T 
and T´, respectively, are given in MeV).  

Implementation of the TENDL data revealed that, all else being equal, the predicted production 
rate of 41Ar in the NuMI target chase improved by about 15%, compared to the previous prediction.  
The TENDL library also provides evaluated nuclear data separately for each stable isotope. This 
is an important feature which can serve as another reason for using the library at low energies, 
because  reaction  thresholds  for  different  isotopes  of  the  same  element  can  differ  significantly. 
Therefore, dealing with evaluated nuclear data files for each isotope instead of a single file for a 
corresponding  natural  mixture  can  provide  more  accurate  results,  for  example,  on  nuclide 
production at low energies.  

3.4. Nuclide production 

Nuclide production in air regions is modelled in MARS15 in two complementary ways: 

•  Fully  analog  exclusive  simulation  of  all  nuclear  interactions  with  scoring  nuclides 
generated. Depending on the projectile energy E, the following event generators are used 
for that in the code: LAQGSM at E > 0.5 GeV; CEM at 0.1 < E < 0.5 GeV for all projectiles 
but neutrons and at 0.014 < E < 0.5 GeV for neutrons; at 0.001 < E < 0.1 GeV, TENDL for 
protons,  d,  t,  3He,  4He  and  photons,  and  CEM  for  all  other  projectiles;  MCNP-like 
algorithms for neutrons at 10-12 GeV to 0.014 GeV. 

•  Energy-dependent  hadron  fluence  folding  with  corresponding  energy-dependent  cross-
sections in the course of Monte-Carlo modeling. The cross-sections are taken from Refs. 
[9] and [10]. 

Both methods used in the same run give similar results for the important nuclides, although not all 
the nuclides exist in the database of the second method. The first approach’s outcome is noticeably 
more detailed, but requires substantially more CPU time to get statistical errors small enough for 

11 

 
 
 
all the nuclides. Therefore, the second approach was used in these calculations for scoring nuclide 
production in the air. 

3.5. Simulation sequence 

A detailed description of the relevant geometry and material properties in the NuMI target chase 
have been implemented in the MARS simulation model. The air composition from Ref. [18] shown 
in Table 1 was used. The central segment of the MARS model is shown in Fig. 3. The entire model 
was  built  using  ROOT-based  geometry  option  recently  implemented  in  MARS  code  [19].  At 
projectile energies above 8 GeV, projectile-target collisions are treated inclusively, while at lower 
energies the LAQGSM model is used. Energy cutoff applied to charged hadrons and neutrons was 
100 keV and 0.001 eV, respectively. For precise simulation of low-energy neutron collisions, the 
calculations were performed in MCNP mode [3, 20].

4. Comparison between measurements and calculations 

One can see in Table 2 the NuMI data comparison with full MARS (DeTra) calculations for 41Ar, 
11C, 13N and 15O. Nuclides 11C and 13N are produced mostly by high energy particles and they are 
easier to predict than 41Ar which is produced by low energy neutrons. Therefore, we were quite 
glad  to  obtain  a  30%  agreement  on  NuMI  air  activation  between  data  and  full  Monte-Carlo 
calculations for 11C and 13N and better than a factor of two agreement for 41Ar. The uncertainties 
related to the measurements and MARS calculations (one standard deviation) are 12% and 15%, 
respectively.

5. Conclusions 
When comparing absolute production rates of 41Ar, the MARS prediction is 1.8 times lower than 
the measurements.  Given a safety factor of 2 or 3 usually  applied to  code predictions,  such an 
underestimate  is  quite  acceptable.  Taking  into  account  the  above-mentioned  uncertainties 
associated with the measurements and MARS predictions, the agreement for the other significant 
radionuclides is good.
