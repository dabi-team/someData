Introduction

Harnessing the conﬁnement of light with wavelength-scale waveguides and cavities has enabled
the realization of table-top scale nonlinear optical phenomena in silicon-compatible photonic chips.
Recent examples show the versatility of this integrated photonics approach, such as frequency
comb generation [1, 2], quantum computation [3–8], low voltage eletro-optical modulation [9],
and optical to microwave coherent conversion [10]. One key ingredient that may also boost this
revolution is the interaction between light and mechanical degrees of freedom, enabling both
read-out and actuation of mesoscale mechanical modes in waveguides [11] and cavities [12–15],
paving the road towards the sound circuits revolution [16, 17]. Throughout the quest for better
suited cavity geometries that can host optical and mechanical waves, microdisk cavities have
proven to be a simple and eﬀective choice. Their tight radial conﬁnement of whispering gallery
optical waves and rather strong interaction with radial breathing mechanical modes lead to
high optomechanical coupling rates [18–20], which are necessary for eﬃcient device-level
functionalities [7, 21–23]. Other ingredients in the optomechanical enhancement are the cavity
or waveguide material properties. Although silicon is widespread in many optomechanical
devices [14,24–27] due to its mature fabrication, the interest in III-V materials for optomechanical
devices has increased [28–32] due to their unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties.
Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), for instance, is advantageous because of its very high photoelastic
coeﬃcient [33], which leads to large electrostrictive forces and optomechanical coupling [18, 34].
Moreover, optically active layers can be easily grown on GaAs wafers, allowing the fabrication of
light-emitting optomechanical devices [35–37].

Despite the tougher challenges in fabricating high optical quality factor in GaAs cavities,
in comparison to the more mature fabrication of silicon, both wet and dry chemistry etching
have been successfully developed. Wet etching, followed by surface passivation, resulted in
record high intrinsic optical quality factors of 6 × 106 in GaAs microdisks [38]. Nonetheless,
the fabrication of large aspect ratio features and small gaps challenge this route due to wet

 
 
 
 
 
 
etch isotropic characteristics and diﬀusion-limited etching reaction. One alternative is to use
inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) [39–42], which enables independent
control of the plasma density and ion acceleration, allowing a ﬁner control of side-wall roughness
and verticality. The diﬃculty with this technique is the low resist etch resistance that often
demands the use of hard etching mask – in general silicon nitride [43]. The need for a hard mask
not only complicates the lithography process but also requires a mask removal step.

In this work we report an optimized fabrication process for GaAs-based optomechanical
devices that combines standard dry etching chemistry with an electro-resist soft mask, yielding
high optical and mechanical quality factors. By avoiding hard masks we ease the GaAs fabrication
process and widen its potential exploration in more complex optomechanical cavity designs [26].
A complete characterization of the most important ICP-RIE parameters is included, oﬀering a
path for for the fabrication of GaAs optical microdevices. By controlling the sidewall roughness
and verticality, we produced microdisks with optical quality factor as high as Q = 2 × 105 –
among the highest reported using soft or hard-mask assisted dry etching [32, 42–45]. Moreover,
the mechanical characterization of the devices shows mechanical modes with quality factors up
to Qmec = 760 and an optomechanical vacuum coupling rate of g0 = 2π × 13.6 kHz.

2. Microfabrication process

The fabrication steps used in this work follow those of a standard top-down microfabrication
process. We start with an intrinsic GaAs/Al0.7Ga0.3As wafer (250 nm/2000 nm). These wafers
were grown over a GaAs substrate using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) (CMC Microsystems,
Canada). This technique enables control at the atomic monolayer level [46]. It uses an atomic
beam of the materials to be deposited in an ultra-high vacuum atmosphere (∼ 10−11 Torr) while
the substrate is kept at a modest temperature (400 − 800oC), when compared to other techniques,
which reduces impurity atoms diﬀusion along the deposited layer. Therefore, a high purity device
layer of GaAs is obtained, reducing imperfections in microdevices fabrication that also impact
optical and mechanical quality factors of the ﬁnal devices.

A thin layer of electroresist (ZEP520A - Zeon Chemicals) is spun (Figs. 1a)-b)) over the
MBE-deposited GaAs layer. Then, the electroresist is patterned with electron-beam lithography,
as detailed in section 2.1, yielding the microdisk shaped patterns illustrated in Fig. 1c). The next
step consists of the removal of the superﬁcial GaAs layer using ICP-RIE chlorine-based plasma
etching. Although this is a straightforward method, it possesses a large number of parameters
(chamber pressure, gases ﬂow, RF powers) that can be tuned to improve surface roughness and

control the sidewall etching angle (anisotropy). In sections 2.3 and 2.4 we explored several of
these parameters in order to understand their role in the etching process. Next, a wet release step
of the devices if performed and ﬁnalized with a surface cleaning procedure detailed in section
2.5.

2.1. Lithography parameters

The biggest challenge in using an electroresist soft mask for GaAs etching is their low etch
resistance. Here we use a positive electro-resist, ZEP520A, which has both high sensitivity and
spatial resolution, yet its etch selectivity to GaAs is high enough to withstand the dry etching
process. In this work, we used a 30 kV electron beam lithography tool (eLINE Plus from Raith
Inc.).

The sample were cleaned with hot acetone (∼ 50◦C) and hot isopropyl alcohol (∼ 70◦C), for 5
minutes, followed by a 30 seconds HF:H2O (1:10) dip to remove native oxide. The samples were
pre-baked for 5 minutes in a hot plate at 180◦C, in order to remove residual water and improve
adherence of the electroresist. Then ZEP520A is spun at 2000 rpm during 60 seconds, resulting
in an ≈ 500 nm thick resist. Thereafter, we bake the sample again at 180◦C during 2 minutes, to
evaporate solvents present in the resist.

Electron diﬀusion through the resist and scattering are known to aﬀect the angle of the
developed resist pattern edges. An exposure dose test was performed to ﬁnd the optimum doses
for our samples, as shown in Fig. 2a)-c). At higher doses, a clearly sloped edge is formed. We
choose to work with the vertical proﬁles as the patterned disks diameters are more accurate.

2.2. Reﬂow of electroresist

Minimizing the resist’s sidewall roughness is critical as it will be transferred to the GaAs layer
during the dry etching process. However, evaluating developed resist sidewall roughness through
SEM images is rather challenging. Indeed, despite the apparent sidewall smoothness, show in in
Fig. 2, the etched GaAs sidewalls still presented noticeable roughness after plasma etching, as
it is noticeable in Fig. 3a). This suggests that that further treatment of the developed resist is
required to improve sidewall roughness.

In order to reduce the sidewall roughness transferred to the GaAs we apply thermal reﬂow
of the patterned resist, which is another advantage of using ZEP 520A. This step consists in
baking the resist on a hot plate at a temperature higher than the resist softening point, allowing its
molecular redistribution and internal stress relaxation that prevent cracks. Previous results with
ZEP520A suggest a reﬂow temperature of 140 − 145oC [47], as suggested by the manufacturer.
However, this temperature is not high enough to signiﬁcantly reduce roughness, as shown in
Figs. 3a)-b). This can be attributed to a higher molecular resist weight after exposure, which

parameters were gas ﬂow Ar/Cl2 = 12/8 sccm, RF power = 150 W, ICP power = 210 W,
and chamber pressure = 4.5 mTorr. All images were taken at 20 kV using secondary electron
detector. The top resist layer was false-colored as red, the brightness contrast between the

has been reported to translate into a higher reﬂow temperatures for resists based on molecular
chain scission [47–49]. Indeed, an increase of the reﬂow temperature signiﬁcantly improves
sidewalls proﬁle, as shown in Fig. 3c)-d). This conﬁrms our hypotheses that the exposed resist
still exhibited residual roughness, despite it was hard to observe it in the SEM images shown in
Fig. 2. It is also clear from Fig. 3 that the reﬂow process impacts the angle of the patterned disk
sidewall [47]. As a consequence, angled walls are transferred to the GaAs layer.

2.3. Argon (Ar) and Chlorine (Cl2) ﬂow

A typical ICP-etching equipment allows control over several etching parameters, including
gases ﬂow, chamber pressure and plate and coil powers. In this section, we describe the role of
gases ﬂow in GaAs/AlGaAs etching with the ZEP520A masks. We ﬁxed the total gas ﬂow (20
sccm), such that changes in the gases proportion would not impact the chamber base pressure.
Diﬀerent proportions of the mixture Ar+Cl2 were used and the proﬁles obtained can be seen in
Fig. 4. Throughout these steps, we used a reﬂowed resist mask in the most suitable temperature
(2 min at 160oC) in order to isolate the etch chemistry sidewall roughness.

Fig. 4a) shows a very smooth wall achieved with a high percentage (80%) of argon in the
mixture. However, a bit of roughness is still noticeable on the resist’s upper surface, what could
reﬂect on a higher amount superﬁcial defects in the disks. This is caused by the sputtering
resulting from the presence of argon ions in the plasma and can be reduced by increasing the
proportion of chlorine in the mixture, as shown in Fig. 4b). Further increase of the chlorine ﬂow
signiﬁcantly enhances chemical reactions in the plasma, resulting in a rougher etch, as can be
seen in Figs. 4c)-d). Such roughness sets an upper limit to the chlorine proportion in the mixture.
In addition to the surface roughness of the walls, it is necessary to calibrate the etch rate of

each plasma recipe, especially to fabricate devices with tight geometrical constraints [26]. These
diﬀerent rates were obtained using an atomic force microscope, which can fully characterize
the sample topography. The measurements are performed in three steps: the topography of the
sample is obtained i) before ICP-etching, ii) after ICP-etching with the electroresist and iii) after
removing the electroresist. We can precisely measure the isolated etch rates of GaAs or AlGaAs,
and the overall etch selectivity between the resist and GaAs/AlGaAs can be calculated, as shown
in table 1. We observe a large increase in the GaAs/AlGaAs etching rate when there is more
chlorine in the plasma, with a signiﬁcantly lower resist etching rate. This indicates the possibility
of using a plasma of high percentage of chlorine combined with a ZEP520A soft mask to achieve
deep-etched [50] devices. Due to the large GaAs/AlGaAs etch rate obtained for the highest
chlorine ﬂow (4/16 Ar/Cl2), we used shorter duration time for this etch when compared to the
other gas mixtures. Contrary to the trend observed for the lower chlorine mixtures, this led to a
smaller resist etch rate. Given the etch short duration, this lower rate suggests a non-uniform
resist etch rate.

The image in a) is also shown in Fig. 3c) and Fig. 4b), for easier comparison.

2.4. Chamber pressure

Chamber pressure in ICP etching changes the ions mean free path and can signiﬁcantly modify
the chemical proﬁle of the etch process [46]. In order to evaluate the impact of this parameter on
the etch results, we fabricated microdisks using diﬀerent chamber pressures, as can be seen in
Fig. 5.

In general, changes in chamber pressure did not signiﬁcantly modify sidewall roughness of
the GaAs, but it did so for the AlGaAs. An overall selectivity between GaAs/AlGaAs and resist
higher than 3.75 was observed, as shown in the table 2, indicating the suitability of this recipe to
thicker GaAs-layer devices. We also observe a change in the sidewall angles depending on the
pressure, from a ∼ 25o angle in Fig. 5a) for Pch = 4.5 mTorr to an almost vertical wall in Fig. 5d)
for Pch = 9.0 mTorr. This degree of control of the sidewall angle could be used to manipulate the
optical mode overlap with the disk edge, which has been shown to increase the optical quality
factors [51].

We conclude this section with an optimized fabrication recipe, consisting of an lithography

= 150 W, ICP power = 210 W, Ar/Cl2 ﬂow = 12/8 sccm and Pch = 4.5 mTorr. After the etching
process, the residual resist is removed by dipping the sample for 5 minutes in trichloroethylene
(TCE), 1 minute in acetone, 1 minute in isopropyl alcohol and then blow dry with N2.

2.5. Undercut and cleaning steps

In order to ensure the mechanical degrees of freedom of the microdisk cavities, a ﬁnal wet
isotropic etching of the AlGaAs layer is performed to undercut the cavity. After the TCE cleaning
step, the disks are released using a diluted solution of HF:H2O (1:60), which is known to result
in AlF3 and Al(OH)3 residues [52]. These residues are cleaned with a dip in a H2O2 solution
(30%) for 1 minute. A ﬁnal dip in a KOH solution (20% in mass, at 80◦C) during 3 minutes is
performed to remove oxidized surface layer [52]. These ﬁnal cleaning steps are crucial to ensure
a clean sample and high optical quality factors.

The GaAs microdisks fabricated with the optimized recipe exhibit high optical and mechanical
quality factors, among the highest reported using soft or hard-mask assisted dry etching [32,42–45].
A schematic of the setup used for device characterization can be seen in Fig. 6a). A tunable
laser is sent to an optical ﬁber circuit, an 1% tap feeds a calibrated ﬁber-based Mach-Zehnder
interferometer and acetylene gas cell for frequency detuning reference and absolute frequency
reference. Light is coupled to the cavity through the evanescent ﬁeld of a tapered optical ﬁber
(≈ 2 µm diameter). The transmitted signal is split (10%) to feed a transmission monitoring slow
photodetector, and (90%) to feed a fast photodetector (≈ 800 MHz bandwidth) to monitor the
RF intensity modulation induced on light ﬁeld by the cavity mechanical modes [12]. Also, a
phase modulator is used to calibrate the optomechanical coupling following the technique by
Gorodetsky et al [53].

A typical optical transmission spectrum of a 10 µm radius microdisk fabricated with the
optimized recipe is shown in Fig. 6b) with the highest optical quality factor resonance highlighted
in red. An optical microscopy image of the corresponding device is shown in Fig. 6c). This
highest Q mode is also shown in Fig. 6d), where the ﬁtted model reveals an intrinsic optical
quality factor of Qopt = 2.03 × 105; the observed splitting is accounted for in the ﬁtting model
and is due to clockwise and counter-clockwise mode coupling. This quality factor is on pair with
those obtained through dry-etching using hard [43] or soft mask [32], yet lower than those of
passivated wet-etched disks [31].

We have also performed further analysis of the optical modes to infer their transverse mode
polarization and radial order. In the Fig. 6b), it is possible to identify a periodic pattern of the
modes, related to the free spectral range (FSR) of the transverse optical mode families. In fact, we
ﬁnd that the FSR of higher Qopt modes closely match those of TE-modes calculated with ﬁnite
element method (with material dispersion [54] included). Finally, we have statistically compared
our optimized etching recipe but with diﬀering at the resist reﬂow step. We show the results
in Fig. 6e) with the quality factors of all modes observed in the tested wavelength range. The
orange bars represent the cavity without the resist reﬂow process, showing a distribution more
localized at lower Q. On the other hand, the blue bars represent the reﬂowed device, showing
a distribution with higher Q and peak values around Qopt ∼ 2 × 105. This conﬁrms that our
optimized fabrication process consistently improved the optical quality of the GaAs microdisks.
To assess the optomechanical performance of our microdisk we analyzed the radio-frequency

with a quality factor of Qmec = 760. A phase modulator calibration tone can be seen at

used. Exciting the disk at its highest Q mode at 1563.4 nm, we were able to observe the RF
tone corresponding to the fundamental mechanical breathing mode (see inset of Fig. 7a)) at
Ωmec = 2π × 370 MHz. The corresponding mechanical quality factor Qmec = 760 is obtained by
ﬁtting the lorentzian shape shown in Fig. 7a). The signal of a calibrated phase-modulator is also
shown and was used for the calibration of the optomechanical vacuum coupling constant [53],
yielding g0 = 2π × 13.6 kHz. This coupling rate is 50% larger than one would achieve with a
similar geometry using a silicon based device, mainly caused by the large photoelastic coeﬃcients
of GaAs [33], responsible for more than 30% of the total optomechanical coupling rate in this
case.

One property of optomechanical devices is that the mechanical modes may experience a
back-action force from the optical ﬁelds. When the laser is blue-detuned with respect to the
mode, the positive feedback force can drive the mechanical system into self-sustained oscillations.
Although this is rather straightforward, semiconductor-based cavities often suﬀer from detrimental
nonlinear loss that prevents reaching this regime. For our devices, when the blue-detuned pump
power was increased to P ∼ 1 mW, the self-sustained oscillation threshold was easily reached.
A strong RF tone (> 50 dBm of signal above noise) was observed and shown in Fig. 7b). It
is also possible to see a slight red-shift of the mechanical frequency in the oscillating peak
of ≈ 3.5 MHz, which is attributed to thermal softening of GaAs [55]. This shows that disks
produced with our fabrication process can be used as mechanical oscillators, a key aspect to
investigate other optomechanical phenomena, such as nonlinear dynamics [56, 57], coherent
optical conversion [22] and classical and quantum synchronization [58,59]. Although not explored
here, achieving self-sustaining oscillation shows that optical cooling [14] is within reach of our
devices.

4. Conclusion

We have shown that it is possible to control the roughness and the sidewall proﬁle in GaAs
microdisks by fully characterizing the ICP plasma etching conditions. This process simpliﬁes
fabrication, removing the need of a hard mask and reducing the number of steps in the production
of the devices. High optical conﬁnement can be achieved, with optical quality factor as high
as 2 × 105. Further improvement in optical quality factor can be done if one performs surface
post-treatment as indicated in [31]. Comparing data and simulations, we have evidence that the
higher optical quality factor modes correspond to TE-modes, supporting our hypothesis that
improvement of the quality factors is due to the reduction in sidewall roughness. We have also
investigated the impact of resist reﬂow in our fabrication process. The observation of radial
breathing mechanical modes and excitation of self-sustaining oscillations with low optical powers
shows that GaAs devices could also be used in nonlinear optomechanics experiments.
