Abstract In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength observations of three recurring jets
on 2014 November 7. The jets originated from the same region at the edge of AR 12205
and propagated along the same coronal loop. The eruptions were generated by magnetic
reconnection, which is evidenced by continuous magnetic cancellation at the jet base. The
projected initial velocity of the jet2 is ∼402 km s−1. The accelerations in the ascending
and descending phases of jet2 are not consistent, the former is considerably larger than the
value of g⊙ at the solar surface, while the latter is lower than g⊙. There are two possible
candidates of extra forces acting on jet2 during its propagation. One is the downward gas
pressure from jet1 when it falls back and meets with jet2. The other is the viscous drag
from the surrounding plasma during the fast propagation of jet2.As a contrast, the accel-
erations of jet3 in the rising and falling phases are constant, implying that the propagation
of jet3 is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by extra forces.

1 INTRODUCTION

Jet-like motions at different scales are widespread in the solar atmosphere, including spicules
(Hollweg 1982; de Pontieu et al. 2007), coronal
jets (Shimojo et al. 1996; Cirtain et al. 2007;
Sterling et al. 2015), chromospheric jets (Nishizuka et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2021), net-
work jets (Hassler et al. 1999; Tian et al. 2014), and Hα Surges (Roy 1973; Jiang et al. 2007; Li et al.
2017). These phenomena are important to the transport of mass and energy toward the upper atmo-
sphere and solar wind (Brueckner & Bartoe 1983). Coronal jets were ﬁrst observed by the Soft X-ray
Telescope (SXT) on board the Yohkoh spacecraft (Shibata et al. 1992) and have attracted a remarkable
attention (Raouaﬁ et al. 2016; Shen 2021). With the unceasingly rapid development of solar telescopes,
the understandings of coronal jets are greatly improved. It is generally accepted that coronal jets are
powered by magnetic reconnection, which occurs in the quiet region, coronal holes, and boundary of
the active regions (ARs). One of the observational evidences of magnetic reconnection is magnetic ﬂux
cancellation between the emerging dipolar ﬂux and the ambient open ﬁelds or in converging magnetic
system (Chae et al. 1999; Chen et al. 2008, 2015; Panesar et al. 2016; Sterling et al. 2017).

Coronal jets show diverse morphology. They are originally classiﬁed into the inverse-Y type and
two-sided-loop type (Shibata et al. 1994; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995; Tian et al. 2017; Shen et al. 2019).
According to the height of magnetic reconnection, they are also classiﬁed into the Eiffel tower type, λ
type, and micro-CME type (Nistic`o et al. 2009). In addition, Moore et al. (2010) put forward the concept
of blowout jets compared with the standard jets. The blowout jets are usually produced by the eruption

of miniﬁlaments (Hong et al. 2011; Li et al. 2015; Sterling et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016). Some of the
jets are related to the fan-spine topology with the presence of a magnetic null point (Wang & Liu 2012;
Zhang et al. 2012, 2021; Joshi et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020).

Coronal

jets are not always uniform in shape and temperature during their evolution.
Patsourakos et al. (2008) ﬁrst reported helical structure in a coronal jet, which is veriﬁed to be a com-
mon feature (Nistic`o et al. 2009; Schmieder et al. 2013; Zhang & Ji 2014a; Joshi et al. 2018; Chen et al.
2021). Both hot (105-106 K) and cold components (104-105 K) are found to coexist in coronal jets,
although they are not strictly co-spatial (Alexander & Fletcher 1999; Jiang et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2007;
Nistic`o et al. 2011). Using two-dimensional MHD numerical simulations, Nishizuka et al. (2008) re-
produced the hot and cold components in jets. Intermittent, bright and compact plasmoids (blobs) in
recurring extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets were ﬁrst observed and investigated by Zhang & Ji (2014b),
which are explained as a result of tearing-mode instability in the current sheet where magnetic recon-
nection takes place. The sizes of plasmoids are extended to subarcsecond (Zhang & Ni 2019) thanks
to the high resolution of slit-jaw imager (SJI) on board the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014). Li et al. (2019) studied two coronal jets occurring during two M-class
ﬂares observed in 304 ˚A. Many vortex-like structures are identiﬁed in the upstream and downstream
regimes, which are interpreted by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a combination of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability and Raleigh-Taylor instability.

It is noted that not all jets escape the corona successfully. Some of them decelerate and fall back after
reaching the apex. For instance, Liu et al. (2009) investigated a chromospheric jet observed by Hinode
on 2007 February 9 and obtained the mean projected acceleration (-141 m s−2). Zhang & Ji (2014a)
studied a swirling EUV jet related to a C1.6 ﬂare on 2011 October 15 and calculated the mean apparent
acceleration (-97 m s−2). Sakaue et al. (2018) analyzed a solar jet associated with a C5.4 class ﬂare
observed simultaneously in Hα and soft X-ray on 2014 November 11. The apparent acceleration (-176
m s−2) and inclination angle (∼50◦) of the jet were derived. It is concluded that the actual acceleration
of the jet was consistent with the gravitational acceleration (g⊙ ≈ −274 m s−2) at the solar surface. In
most cases, the acceleration values are basically the same in the ascending and descending phases of jets.
When external forces apart from the gravity are involved, things are different. Using both spectroscopic
and stereoscopic observations, Lu et al. (2019) studied a series of recurrent jets that fell back to the solar
surface at speeds of 40−170 km s−1 on 2014 July 7. Huang et al. (2020) reported the multiwavelength
observations of a solar jet propagating along a closed coronal loop on 2015 May 4. Rapid change of
the jet’s acceleration was found when the jet moved to the apex. It is proposed that the chromosphere
evaporation at the remote footpoint propagates along the coronal loop and provides downward pressure
on the jet, which causes the drastic change of acceleration.

Recurring jets are frequently observed (e.g., Chae et al. 1999; Chifor et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2015).
In this paper, we analyze recurrent jets containing three jets (jet1, jet2, and jet3) originating from the
same base at the edge of AR 12205 on 2014 November 7. The acceleration of jet2 in the rising and
falling phases show different values due to the inﬂuence of jet1. And jet3 serves as the control group.
We describe the data analysis in Section 2. The results are represented in Section 3. Comparison with
previous works are discussed in Section 4. A brief summary is given in Section 5.

2 DATA ANALYSIS

The data used here were observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012)
and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). AIA takes full-disk EUV images in 94, 131, 171, 193, 211,
304, and 335 ˚A with a time cadence of 12 s. The photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms are
obtained from HMI with a cadence of 45 s. The level 1 data of AIA and HMI are calibrated with a spatial
resolution of 1.2′′ using the standard Solar Software (SSW) programs aia prep.pro and hmi prep.pro,
respectively.

3 RESULTS

Figure 1(a-c) show EUV images of AR 12205 observed by AIA in 211, 171, and 304 ˚A during jet2,
respectively. The dashed rectangle in panel (a) represents the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of Figure 2. The base
of the jets is within the white solid box.

In Figure 2, twelve snapshots of the AIA 304 ˚A images illustrate the temporal evolution of the
recurring jets, which belong to the blowout type due to their visibility in 304 ˚A. The jet1 appeared at
∼09:38 UT and propagated along the guiding magnetic ﬁeld as is shown in Figure 2(a-b). At ∼10:02
UT, the jet2 started to erupt, when jet1 was on its way falling down (see Figure 2(c)). The jet1 continued
to move downward along the ﬂux tube when jet2 keeps rising, until it merged into the jet2 at ∼10:10

UT (see Figure 2(d-f)). The jet2 fell back to the footpoint at ∼10:38 UT. The positions of ﬂux tube at
10:06:31 UT and 10:16:43 UT are indicated by P1 and P2 in Figure 2(d) and (g), respectively. The trans-
verse drift of the ﬂux tube may suggest that the jet2 did not follow the same path during its ascending
and descending phases.

During 10:38−14:08 UT, a few jets occurred from the jet footpoint, but with much smaller temporal
and spatial scales, which are out of the scope of this study. The jet3 appeared at ∼14:08 and reached
its apex at ∼14:20 UT, and ﬁnally fell back to the footpoint at ∼14:37 UT (see Figure 2(j-l)). It is seen
from the online animations (Fig2-1.mp4, Fig2-2.mp4) that the jets in four passbands (171, 193, 211, and
304 ˚A) were roughly cospatial and cotemporal.

In order to investigate the longitudinal motion of jet2, we draw a curved slit S1 along the axis of jet,
which is 134′′ in length and 10′′ in width (see Figure 1(a)). The time-distance diagrams of S1 in 304,
171, 193 and 211 ˚A during jet2 are displayed in Figure 3. The ascending and descending motions of jet2
are clearly illustrated by the parabolic trajectory. The solid curves C1 and C2 represent the outer and
inner boundaries of the trajectory during the ascending phase, while the curves C4 and C3 represent the
outer and inner boundaries of the trajectory during the descending phase. They are ﬁtted with a quadratic
function (Zhang & Ji 2014a):

s(t) =

a0(t − t0)2 + b0(t − t0) + c0,

(1)

where t0 = 10 : 00 UT, b0 denotes the projected initial velocity at t0, a0 denotes the projected acceler-
ation of jet2 at the plane of sky.

The results of curve ﬁtting for C1 and C2 are used to obtain the initial velocity and acceleration
during the ascending phase. The mean values of b0 and a0 in the four passbands are listed in second
and third column of Table 1. Likewise, the results of curve ﬁtting for C4 and C3 are used to obtain
the acceleration during the descending phase. The mean values of a0 in the four passbands are listed

represent the outer and inner boundaries of jet2 in the falling phase.

in the fourth column of Table 1. It is seen that the projected initial velocity of jet2 lies in the range of
360−430 km s−1 and has an average of ∼402 km s−1. The acceleration of jet2 during the rising phase,
even taking into account of projection effect, is much greater than g⊙, while the acceleration during the
falling phase is signiﬁcantly less than g⊙.

In order to explore the transverse motion of jet2, we take ﬁve narrow slits (cut0−cut4) across the
axis in Figure 1(a), which are 32′′ in length and 5′′ in width. In Figure 4, the time-slice diagrams
of cut0−cut4 in 171 ˚A illustrate the transverse motion of jet2. The diagrams of cut0−cut2 show the
transverse oscillation motion of the jet2 at the onset of eruption, and the diagram of cut3 reveals the
disappearance of the transverse motion when the jet rose to a certain height, indicating that the rotation
weakened as the jet moved upward. The apparent velocities of the transverse oscillation are 10−20 km
s−1 using a linear ﬁtting (see the solid lines). The transverse rotation of the jet during its rising phase
is similar to the event on 2011 October 15 (Zhang & Ji 2014a), which is interpreted as the impulsive
release and transfer of the accumulated magnetic helicity (Fang et al. 2014).

Between jet2 and jet3, there were small-scale and short-lived jets originating from the jet base,
which are out of the scope of this article. The time-distance diagram of S1 in 304 ˚A during jet3 is
shown in Figure 5, showing its longitudinal motion. Note that jet3 could not be clearly observed in other
passbands. Three segments (D1, D2 and D3) could be distinctly identiﬁed in the diagram, which are

where t1 = 13 : 50 UT, b1 denotes the projected initial velocity at t1, and a1 denotes the acceleration.
The results of curve ﬁtting for the three segments are listed in the Table 2. It is shown in Figure 5 that the
trajectories of the segments of jet3 can be well described with parabolic curves of constant acceleration
in the ascending and descending phases. The initial velocities with an average value of ∼250 km s−1
are lower than those of jet2. The average acceleration is ∼210 m s−2, which is lower than g⊙.

To investigate the triggering mechanism of the recurrent jets, we draw the photospheric LOS mag-
netogram observed by HMI at 10:11:43 UT in Figure 1(d). Like in Figure 1(a), the solid box signiﬁes
the area of jet base. A short slit (S2) within the box is used to investigate the magnetic ﬁeld evolution.
The time-distance diagram of S2 is displayed in Figure 6. The red, blue, purple, and green dashed lines
signify the start time of jet1, end time of jet2, start time of jet3, and end time of jet3, respectively. It
is obvious that the positive and negative polarities were continuously approaching each other during

magnetic ﬂux cancellation (Panesar et al. 2016; Sterling et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2017).

4 DISCUSSION

As mentioned in Section 1, the falling back of solar jets after rising to their apex is not uncommon.
The acceleration usually keep constant during the whole evolution, implying a free fall. Liu et al. (2009)
reported recurrent chromospheric jets on the west limb observed in Ca II passband (log T ≈ 4.0 −
4.3). The jets lasted for more than one hour with intervals of 12−14 minutes. The average projected
acceleration is ∼-141 m s−2 (see Table 3). Zhang & Ji (2014a) analyzed a swirling ﬂare-related coronal
jet occurring at the edge of AR 11314. The projected acceleration of the jet is calculated to be -97 m
s−2. Sakaue et al. (2018) studied a solar jet related to a C5.4 ﬂare. The projected acceleration (-176
m s−2) and inclination angle (∼50◦) of the jet are derived. It is found that the projected accelerations
in the previous works are lower than g⊙. The difference in values is mostly attributed to the different
inclination angles.

However, when external forces are involved, the acceleration of a jet changes. Huang et al. (2020)
reported the observation of a jet propagating along a closed coronal loop. Instant brightening is found at
the remote footpoints of the loop, which is probably heated by the nonthermal electrons, MHD waves,
and/or a conduction front generated by the magnetic reconnection associated with the jet. Extension of
brightening along the loop, which is interpreted by chromospheric evaporation, meets with the ejecta
near the loop apex and acts as a brake on the ejecta, leading to a strong deceleration (see Table 3).

In this work, we study three recurring jets originating from the same region and propagating along
the same coronal loop. The ﬁrst two jets erupted with short time interval, while the third jet occurred
independently. As jet2 rises at an initial velocity of ∼400 km s−1, it shows unwinding motion, which
implies the release and transfer of magnetic helicity. Interestingly, the accelerations in the ascending
(arise) and descending (af all) phases of jet2 are not the same (see Table 1). The mean value of arise
is larger than g⊙, suggesting that additional force is at work apart from the gravity. Considering the
short interval between jet1 and jet2 and the fact that jet1 moved downward when jet2 was moving
upward along the same ﬂux tube, jet1 may bring downward gas pressure to jet2, which act as an extra
force that decelerates jet2 (Huang et al. 2020). Moreover, the ﬂux tube was ﬁlled with hot and dense
plasma from jet1, which exerts a viscous drag force during the fast propagation of jet2 (Vrˇsnak 2001).
In contrast, the accelerations in the ascending and descending phases of jet3 are equivalent and lower
than g⊙ (see Table 2), implying that extra forces are absent during jet3. Therefore, the inconsistency
in the accelerations of jet2 is most probably caused by the inﬂuence of jet1. State-of-the-art numerical
simulations are needed to carry out a in-depth investigation of the dynamics of coronal jets (Wyper et al.
2018).

5 SUMMARY

In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength observations of three recurring jets on 2014 November 7.
The jets originated from the same region at the edge of AR 12205 and propagated along the same coro-
nal loop. The eruptions were generated by magnetic reconnection, which is evidenced by continuous
magnetic cancellation at the jet base. The projected initial velocity of the jet2 is ∼402 km s−1. The ac-

celerations in the ascending and descending phases of jet2 are not consistent, the former is considerably
larger than the value of g⊙ at the solar surface, while the latter is lower than g⊙. There are two possible
candidates of extra forces acting on jet2 during its propagation. One is the downward gas pressure from
jet1 when it falls back and meets with jet2. The other is the aerodynamic drag force during the fast
propagation of jet2. As a contrast, the accelerations of jet3 in the rising and falling phases are constant,
implying that the propagation of jet3 is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by extra forces.
