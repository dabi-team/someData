Abstract

We report on searches for neutrinos and antineutrinos from astrophysical sources performed with the Borexino
detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. Electron antineutrinos (¯νe) are detected in an organic
liquid scintillator through the inverse β-decay reaction. In the present work we set model-independent upper limits
in the energy range 1.8-16.8 MeV on neutrino ﬂuxes from unknown sources that improve our previous results, on
average, by a factor 2.5. Using the same data set, we ﬁrst obtain experimental constraints on the diﬀuse supernova ¯νe
ﬂuxes in the previously unexplored region below 8 MeV. A search for ¯νe in the solar neutrino ﬂux is also presented: the

presence of ¯νe would be a manifestation of a non-zero anomalous magnetic moment of the neutrino, making possible
its conversion to antineutrinos in the strong magnetic ﬁeld of the Sun. We obtain a limit for a solar ¯νe ﬂux of 384
cm−2s−1 (90% C.L.), assuming an undistorted solar 8B neutrinos energy spectrum, that corresponds to a transition
probability pνe→¯νe < 7.2×10−5 (90% C.L.) for E¯νe > 1.8 MeV. At lower energies, by investigating the spectral shape
of elastic scattering events, we obtain a new limit on solar 7Be-νe conversion into ¯νe of pνe→¯νe < 0.14 (90% C.L.) at
0.862 keV. Last, we investigate solar ﬂares as possible neutrino sources and obtain the strongest up-to-date limits on
the ﬂuence of neutrinos of all ﬂavor neutrino below 3–7 MeV. Assuming the neutrino ﬂux to be proportional to the
ﬂare’s intensity, we exclude an intense solar ﬂare as the cause of the observed excess of events in run 117 of the Cl-Ar
Homestake experiment.

1. Introduction

Astrophysical neutrinos cover at least 18 orders of
magnitude in energy, starting from meV (relic neutri-
nos) till PeV, the highest energy neutrinos ever detected
as of today. Alongside the detection of gravitational
waves [1], an event that has opened a new era of gravi-
tational astronomy, collecting more data on astrophysi-
cal neutrinos and discovering their possible new sources
will aﬀect the very foundations of our understanding of
the Universe. Neutrino detectors indeed start playing a
substantial role in multi-messenger astronomy [2].

So far, neutrino astronomy has accumulated a wide
range of experimental achievements, including the de-
tection of neutrinos from supernova SN1987A [3, 4, 5,
6], the detection of extragalactic neutrinos with energies
up to 2 PeV [7], and the precision spectroscopy of neu-
trinos from the Sun [8]. For some neutrino sources the
accumulation of statistics is ongoing, while others do
not have experimental conﬁrmation yet.

Borexino detector has proven its potential in the var-
ious ﬁelds of experimental neutrino astronomy. Among
the recent achievements are the precise spectral mea-
surements of neutrinos originating in diﬀerent nuclear
fusion reactions of the pp chain in the Sun [8], the best
upper limits on the neutrino and antineutrino ﬂuences of
all ﬂavors from gamma-ray bursts in the energy range
Eν < 7 MeV [9], and the best upper limits on all ﬂa-
vor neutrino ﬂuence associated with gravitational wave
events within 0.5–5.0 MeV energy range [10]. This pa-
per is aimed to explore the possible existence of tiny
antineutrino ﬂuxes associated to extraterrestrial sources,
as well as to search for possible neutrino signals time-
correlated with solar ﬂares.

A solar ﬂare is a sudden ﬂash of increased bright-
ness on the Sun: powerful ﬂares are often accompanied
by a coronal mass ejection.
If the ejection occurs in
the direction of the Earth, related particles can pene-
trate into the upper atmosphere, cause bright auroras,
and even disrupt long range radio communication. Neu-
trinos could be emitted in correlation with solar ﬂares:
the protons accelerated in the regions of magnetic re-
connection occurred during the ﬂare, may produce pions
through a number of nuclear collisions in plasma. Elec-
tron and muon neutrinos in the MeV-GeV range may
originate in the sequential decays of pions and muons
and be ejected from the Sun. The detection of neutrinos
in the solar ﬂares would provide a deeper understand-
ing of nuclear processes in the solar atmosphere. The
experimental studies began after the attempt to attribute
an excess of neutrino events observed in several runs
taken by the Homestake experiment [11, 12] to the so-

lar ﬂares. Thereafter, the search for solar ﬂare neutri-
nos in MeV energy range was pursued by Kamiokande
[13, 14], LSD [15], and SNO [16], and limits on neu-
trino ﬂuence were set.

Among the possible extraterrestrial sources of an-
tineutrinos are the supernovae explosions and the con-
version of solar νe → ¯νe in the strong solar magnetic
ﬁeld in the case of an anomalous neutrino magnetic mo-
ment.

The Diﬀuse Supernova Neutrino Background
(DSNB, sometimes referred to as supernova relic neutri-
nos) is formed by the whole of the star collapsing during
the evolution of the Universe and consists of neutrinos
and antineutrinos of all ﬂavors. The study of DSNB
energy spectra allows us to address important issues of
neutrino physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

The observed DSNB ﬂux spectrum is given by [17]:

for individual supernova, RS N(z) is the supernova rate at
the distance z to the observer, Ωm and ΩΛ are the rela-
tive densities of matter and dark energy in the Universe,
respectively. The spectrum is sensitive to particular cos-
mological model through Ωm and ΩΛ and reﬂects the ex-
pansion of the Universe through the dependence on H0.
Other impacts of DSNB studies are neutrino properties,
due to the dependence of dNν(E(cid:48)
ν)
on neutrino mass hi-
dE(cid:48)
ν
erarchy, on neutrino magnetic moment, and on the still
not-excluded non-standard interactions of neutrinos. In
recent years, several experiments searched for DSNB.
The KamLAND collaboration set an upper limit for the
diﬀuse supernova ¯νe ﬂux of 139 cm−2s−1 (90% C.L.)
in the energy range 8.3–31.8 MeV [18]. The Super-
Kamiokande set an upper bound of 2.9 ¯νe cm−2s−1 (90%
C.L.) in the energy region E ¯νe > 17.3 MeV [19]. For νe
the upper limit of 70 cm−2s−1 (90% C.L.) was inferred
by Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in the energy range
22.9–36.9 MeV [20].

Apart from DSNB, we performed a search for an-
tineutrinos in the solar neutrino ﬂux. The presence of
¯νe would be a manifestation of the anomalous mag-
netic moment of neutrino, making possible its conver-
sion to antineutrino in the magnetic ﬁeld of the Sun
due to combined eﬀects of the spin-ﬂavor precession
(SFP) and neutrino oscillations. Borexino collaboration
has published the results of a model-independent study
of solar and other unknown antineutrino ﬂuxes in 2011

3

[21]. Based on ﬁve-fold increase in statistics, this paper
presents an update on model-independent search and in-
cludes model-dependent limits on DSNB antineutrinos
and solar neutrino conversion.

The paper is structured as follows. After an
overview of the Borexino detector layout (Section 2),
the investigation for extraterrestrial ¯νe ﬂuxes is de-
tailed in Section 3: ﬁrst the events selection cuts and
the background sources are described, then we present
the results divided into three main topics: (1) model-
independent ¯νe analysis, (2) search for DSNB ¯νe and (3)
limits on the solar νe into ¯νe conversion probability. On
this last topic we present the limits obtained not only
by looking for the inverse β-decay signals but also the
¯νe elastic scattering process, below the inverse β-decay
threshold.

At last, Section 4 is devoted to the search for neu-

trino signals associated to solar ﬂares.

2. The Borexino experiment

Borexino is an unsegmented liquid scintillation de-
tector built for the spectral measurement of low–energy
solar neutrinos installed in the underground hall C of the
Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy.
The target mass is made of 278 tons of ultra–pure liquid
scintillator (pseudocumene (PC) doped with 1.5 g/l of
diphenyloxazole) and enclosed within a spherical nylon
inner vessel (IV) with a radius of 4.25 m. The detector
core is shielded from external radiation by 890 tons of
buﬀer liquid, a solution of PC and 2-5 g/l of the light
quencher dimethylphthalate. The buﬀer is divided in
two volumes by the second nylon vessel with a 5.75 m
radius, preventing inward radon diﬀusion and transfer
by convection. All these volumes are contained in a
13.7 m diameter stainless steel sphere (SSS) on which
are mounted 2212 8” photomultiplier tubes (PMT) de-
tecting the scintillation light, forming the so–called In-
ner Detector (ID). The choice of a liquid scintillator as
target is especially important to observe the low energy
neutrino events: the high light yield typical of Borexino
scintillator (∼104 photons/MeV) makes it possible to get
a good energy resolution and to set a very low energy
threshold (50 keV). The high transparency (the attenua-
tion length is close to 10 m at 430 nm) and the fast time
response (a few ns) allow for an event position recon-
struction and a good pulse shape discrimination (PID)
between alpha and beta/gamma decays.

The SSS is immersed in a water tank of 9 m ra-
dius and 16.9 m height (Outer Detector, OD), ﬁlled
with ultra–high purity water and instrumented with 208

PMTs serving as a ˇCerenkov active muon veto. The wa-
ter contained in the water tank (∼2 m, at least, around
the SSS in all directions; 2400 m3 in total) also pro-
vides good shielding with respect to gammas and neu-
trons emitted by the rocks and by the surrounding labo-
ratory environment. A more detailed description of the
Borexino detector can be found in [22]. Several calibra-
tion campaigns with radioactive sources [23] allowed a
decrease in the systematic errors of the measurements
and to optimize Geant4 based Monte Carlo (MC) sim-
ulation code [24]. The present analysis is based on two
semi-independent data acquisition systems: the primary
Borexino readout optimized for solar neutrino physics
up to a few MeV and a fast waveform digitizer system
tuned for events above 1 MeV [22]. The primary elec-
tronics of Borexino, in which all 2212 channels are read
individually, is optimized for energies up to few MeV.
The energy (E) of each event is reconstructed using the
total amount of light registered by all PMTs of the de-
tector, measured as a charge (Np.e.) in photoelectrons
(p.e.), and corrected with a position and time dependent
light collection function E= f (Np.e.; x, y, z, t). This func-
tion was constructed using MC simulations, checked
against calibration data from radioactive sources de-
ployed in diﬀerent positions inside the detector [23, 24].
The reason for the time dependence is that the num-
ber of working PMTs has been declining with time,
with a reduction of ∼35% in 10 years. A typical en-
ergy deposit of 1 MeV at the center of the detector pro-
duces a signal of about 500 photoelectrons (normalized
to 2000 PMTs), resulting in an energy resolution of
∼ 5% /

E(MeV).

√

For higher energies, up to ∼50 MeV, a system was
developed consisting of 96 fast waveform digitizers
(CAEN v896, 8 bit, thereafter FADC - Flash ADC),
each of them reading-in the signal summed from up
to 24 PMTs, with the sampling rate of 400 MHz. The
FADC DAQ energy threshold is ∼1 MeV. Starting from
December 2009, it acquires data in a new hardware con-
ﬁguration, having a separate trigger. FADC energy scale
is calibrated using the 2.22 MeV gamma peak originat-
ing from cosmogenic neutron captures on protons, as
well as by ﬁtting the spectrum of cosmogenic 12B and
Michel electrons from muons decaying inside the de-
tector. The energy resolution of the FADC system was
found to be ∼ 10% /
E(MeV). The two DAQ systems
are synchronized and merged oﬄine with a special soft-
ware utility based on a GPS time of each trigger. Advan-
tages of each system, such as higher energy resolution in
the primary DAQ or advanced software algorithms for
muon and electronics-noise tagging for energies above
1 MeV in the FADCs, were exploited in diﬀerent ways

√

4

depending on the analysis, as speciﬁed below.

2.1. Muon tagging

Despite the 3800 m.w.e. of the rock overburden, the
muon ﬂux at LNGS is still signiﬁcant (1.2 muon/m2/h).
The number of muons crossing the whole detector is
∼8600/day [25, 26] and half of them, on average, de-
posit some energy in the Inner Detector. The muons in
Borexino are identiﬁed both by the signal released in
the outer detector (Outer Detector Flag) and/or by the
space and time distributions of the emitted light in the
inner detector (Inner Detector Flag). The latter distribu-
tions are quite diﬀerent in respect to the one induced in
point-like interactions, e.g., in the low energy neutrino
ones. Due to the OD veto and the pulse shape analysis
of ID tracks, the muon background can be reduced by
a factor of 105. The standard Borexino muon identiﬁ-
cation [25, 26], including both OD veto and ID pulse-
shape muon tagging, is prone to mistakenly tag point-
like events above ∼15 MeV as muons. In this work, we
have optimized the muon cuts for energies up to 20 MeV
that covers all the present analyses, by modifying the
muon tagging based on the ID pulse-shape. In particu-
lar, the threshold values for the variables describing the
mean duration and the peak position of the light pulse
have been accurately tuned with the Borexino simula-
tion code, and further criteria have been added based
on the anisotropy variable S p [27] as well as on the re-
constructed radial position. In addition, muon tagging
based on the FADC waveform analysis was developed
and tested against the sample of muons detected by the
OD: the overeﬃciency to tag point-like events at ener-
gies up to few tens of MeV as muons was cross-checked
on a sample of Michel electrons. In all analyses, events
associated with muons have been removed.

Muons interacting with carbon nuclei in the scin-
tillator or with the surroundings materials can produce
neutrons, high energy gammas and a variety of ra-
dioactive isotopes. To strongly suppress this potential
background, the events following every tagged (and re-
moved) muon are excluded from the data sample: a 2 ms
veto is applied after muons crossing only the OD to re-
move penetrating neutrons. In addition, a veto window
after muons crossing the ID is applied, to suppress cos-
mogenic isotopes. A diﬀerent time length for this win-
dow was chosen, depending on the analysis, from 0.3 to
2 s as detailed below.

2.2. Fiducial volume deﬁnition

The shape of the IV enclosing the Borexino scin-
tillator deviates from a sphere and is changing in time,

5

because of buoyancy eﬀects caused by the diﬀerent den-
sities of the buﬀer and scintillator liquids, as well as
a consequence of a small IV leak that started approxi-
mately in April 2008. To track the evolution of the ves-
sel shape is thus crucial. The vessel is more contam-
inated with respect to the scintillator: the events orig-
inated by the radioactive contaminations of the nylon,
in particular 210Bi, 14C and 208Tl, are selected to recon-
struct the time-dependent IV shape. The procedure was
cross-checked and calibrated over several ID pictures
taken throughout the years with an internal CCD cam-
era system: the precision of the method is found to be of
the order of ±5 cm. For each analysis a Dynamical Fidu-
cial Volume (DFV) is deﬁned by considering the time-
dependent vessel shape. Antineutrinos’ study usually
allows for the choice of a shallow FV cut (25 cm from
the vessel) while the study of neutrino-scattering events
at low energies (<3 MeV) requires a stronger suppres-
sion of the external gamma background and, therefore,
a smaller and innermost FV (75 cm from the vessel).

3. The search for extraterrestrial ¯νe ﬂuxes

The possible signal due to tiny, still undisclosed, ex-
traterrestrial ¯νe ﬂuxes, such as supernovae relic neutri-
nos, can be put in evidence as an excess of events with
respect to the backgrounds and the known sources of
¯νe. A new study is presented here that beneﬁts from the
exceptional radiopurity of the Borexino detector and ex-
tends over a wide energy range, from 1.8 to 16.8 MeV.
In Sec. 3.1 we describe the data set and the events selec-
tion cuts, in Sec. 3.2 the sources of backgrounds, then
the selected events are presented (Sec. 3.3) followed by
the model independent limits for ¯νe ﬂuxes (Sec. 3.4) and
by limits that assume the ¯νe spectral shape predicted by
two diﬀerent recent models of DSNB (Sec. 3.5). Finally
in Sec. 3.6 we present the study of solar νe conversion
into ¯νe together with the corresponding upper limits for
the neutrino magnetic moment.

3.1. Dataset and events selection

Electron antineutrinos are detected in Borexino
through the reaction of Inverse Beta Decay of the free
proton (IBD):

¯νe + p → n + e+

(2)
= 1.8 MeV.
The energy threshold of this reaction is E ¯νe
The positron deposits its kinetic energy and annihilates
almost immediately, inducing a prompt signal. The light
produced in the scattering of the positron is intrinsically
indistinguishable from the light produced by two anni-
hilation gammas, such that both processes contribute to

the total light yield of the prompt signal. This visible
energy E prompt is directly correlated with the incident
antineutrino energy E ¯νe :

(3)

E prompt = E ¯νe − 0.784 MeV.
The neutron quickly thermalizes in the proton-reach
media and is captured by a proton with the mean capture
time τ = 259.7 ± 1.8 µs [26]. The capture of neutron on
a proton is accompanied by the emission of a gamma
with 2.22 MeV energy, that provides a delayed signal.
The space-time coincidence of the prompt and the de-
layed signals provides a clean signature of the ¯νe inter-
action. To select the ¯νe candidates we apply the follow-
ing criteria: the coincidences are searched for with ∆t in
the range 20–1280 µs (∼5 neutron capture time) and a
distance between the reconstructed positions ∆r < 1 m,
that accounts for the uncertainty of the spatial recon-
struction algorithm and the free path of the 2.2 MeV γ’s.
To reduce the external γ-background from radioactive
decays in the detector materials, we accept only can-
didates having the prompt event position reconstructed
inside the inner detector at distance (DIV,prompt) larger
than 25 cm with respect to the the time-varying IV sur-
face: DIV,prompt > 25 cm. The energy of the prompt
event is required to be above the value corresponding
to the IBD threshold, considering the energy resolution
(Np.e.,prompt > 408 p.e.), while for the delayed event, the
energy cut was tuned to cover the gamma peak from
neutron capture on proton (860 < Np.e.,delayed < 1300
p.e.). The lower limit is justiﬁed because photons at
the edge of the scintillator can escape, depositing only a
fraction of their total energy. A pulse shape discrimina-
tion cut is applied, requiring the Gatti parameter [28] of
the delayed events to be less than 0.015. This cut is ef-
fective to remove the time-correlated β + (α + γ) decays
of 214Bi-214Po, having a time constant close to the neu-
tron capture time. Such background was relevant only
during the detector puriﬁcations in 2010-2011 as a con-
sequence of the increased radon contamination.

Among the cosmogenic isotopes, only 8He (τ =
171.7 ms, Q = 10.7 MeV) and 9Li (τ = 257.2 ms, Q =
13.6 MeV) have decay modes with electrons and neu-
trons in the ﬁnal state, indistinguishable from the IBD.
Since the half-life of these nuclides is of the order of
200 ms, a time window of 2 s after a muon crossing
the scintillator is chosen in this analysis to eﬀectively
remove these events. Finally, to further decrease the
neutron-related backgrounds, we reject all events hav-
ing a neutron-like event 2 ms before the prompt or after
the prompt or the delayed events. The present search
for ¯νe ﬂuxes is based on the data acquired between De-
cember 2007 and October 2017 during a total live-time

of 2771 days. After the application of the selection cuts
the total live-time decreases to 2485 days (6.8 years).
The resulting eﬃciency of all cuts has been estimated
by using the Borexino MonteCarlo code to be ε=(85.0
± 1.5)%, and the total exposure for the present data set
is 1494 ± 60 tons per year (100% eﬃciency).

3.2. Backgrounds

The most relevant sources of

¯νe events below
10 MeV are the Earth’s radioactive isotopes and the nu-
clear reactors, while at higher energies the atmospheric
neutrino background dominates the energy spectrum
(see Fig.1).
In the following, we provide the details
about each of these backgrounds.

3.2.1. Geo-neutrinos

Geo-¯νe spectrum extends up to 3.26 MeV, but 238U
and 232Th chain isotopes are the only energic enough
to signiﬁcantly contribute events above the IBD thresh-
old. The largest contribution to the signal is expected
from the rocks closest to the detector, a few hundreds of
kilometers around the experimental site. Detailed mod-
els of the crust composition in the Gran Sasso area have
been developed, based on geological surveys [29]. The
prediction for the overall signal from 238U and 232Th in
the crust (local rocks + rest of the crust) is S geo(crust) =
23.4 ± 2.8 TNU (1 TNU= 1 event/year/1032 target pro-
tons with 100% eﬃciency and for IBD interactions).
In the calculation the eﬀect of neutrino oscillations has
also been included.

each energy bin (black – geo-¯νe, red – reactor ¯νe, green – atmospheric

The signal from the mantle is much more uncertain:
Earth models provide values for the total U and Th mass
in the mantle that span over more than one order of mag-
nitude and the detected signal depends on the distribu-
tion of U and Th inside the Earth. For all these reasons,

6

it is possible to construct models perfectly consistent
with the geochemical and geophysical constraints but
providing very diﬀerent geo-¯νe signals, ranging from
0.9 to 33 TNU.

Borexino has already made a comprehensive study
of geo-neutrinos [30, 31, 32] but the achieved preci-
sion on mantle ¯νe signal is still poor, S geo(Mantle) =
20.9+15.1
−10.3 TNU [32]. Since we want to quote conser-
vative limits, the minimal expected number of events
for each background is considered here. For the present
analysis we have therefore chosen the Minimal Radio-
genic Earth model, which only includes the radioactiv-
ity from the crust and that, in our case, corresponds to
the already mentioned (23.4 ± 2.8) TNU, i.e. 17.9 ± 2.1
events in our data sample.

3.2.2. Reactor antineutrinos

The spectrum of reactor ¯νe is more energetic with
respect to the one from geo-ν and is signiﬁcant till
∼10 MeV. The ¯νe ﬂux comes primarily from the beta
decays of neutron-rich fragments produced in the ﬁs-
235U, 238U, 239Pu, and 241Pu.
sion of four isotopes:
The expected ﬂuxes can be estimated from the knowl-
edge of the monthly energy production at each reac-
tor site, including the neutrino propagation eﬀects. At
present, there are about 440 nuclear power reactors in
the world, providing, nominally, a total amount of about
1200 Thermal GW, corresponding to about 400 Electri-
cal GW. With ∼200 MeV average energy released per
ﬁssion and 6 ¯νe produced along the β-decay chains of
the neutron-rich unstable ﬁssion products, a reactor with
a typical thermal power of 3 GW emits 1020 ¯νe s−1.

In the framework of the geo-¯νe study, a precise
calculation of the expected signal at the Borexino site
has been developed [33]. For each nuclear core, the
nominal thermal power and the monthly Load Factors,
i.e. the fractions of the nominal power really produced
as a function of time are detailed by the International
Agency of Atomic Energy (IAEA) [34]. IAEA provides
the electrical Load Factors, not the thermal ones and
the calculation assumes them to be identical. For each
core, the distance is calculated taking into account the
position of the Borexino detector [31] (lat = 42.4540
◦N, long = 13.5755 ◦W) and the positions of all the
cores in the world according to the database in [33]. To
propagate neutrinos we use the three mixing parame-
ters determined by NU-FIT 3.2 (2018) normal hierar-
chy [35]. The calculation of φi(E ¯νe ), the ¯νe energy spec-
trum for each fuel component (i) at the source, deserves
particular attention. The results from reactor antineu-
trino experiments Daya Bay [36], Double Chooz [37],
RENO [38], and NEOS [39] coherently show that the

7

measured IBD positron energy spectrum deviates sig-
niﬁcantly from the spectral predictions of Mueller et
al. [40]. Besides an average deﬁcit of ∼6% in the whole
spectrum (the so called ”Reactor Anomaly”), a more
pronounced peak between 4–6 MeV is visible in the en-
ergy distribution of the measured events, the so called
”5 MeV bump.” The ratio of the extracted reactor an-
tineutrino spectrum to prediction deviates from unity,
see for instance Fig.3 of ref.[36]. In order to take into
account this eﬀect, we operate in the following way:
ﬁrst we calculate the neutrino spectra corresponding to
all four isotopes according to the parameterization of
Mueller et al. [40]. Then we multiply the total spectrum
by an energy-dependent correction factor based on the
Daya Bay high precision measurement (extracted from
lower panel of Fig. 3 in [36]). By following this pro-
cedure the same correction factor is applied to all the
reactor fuel components (235U,238U,239Pu,241Pu). This
is an approximation since more likely only a few decay
branches have not correctly been accounted for in [40].
However, it can be accepted since these branches are
not yet precisely known, and we are only interested to
judge the possible impact of the reactor spectrum un-
certainty on our results. The calculated antineutrino
signals in Borexino, by applying (or not) the normal-
ization to the DayBay measurement, are shown in Fig.
2 as a function of energy. The corresponding signals
are of 79.9+1.4
−1.4 TNU, respectively, i.e.
there is a diﬀerence of ∼6%, greater than the total un-
certainty ((cid:39)2.5%) on the expected signals, as quoted in
[33]. We notice that the normalized spectra provide, on
average, lower signals because of the 6% correction and
that the ”5 MeV bump,” to some extent, compensates
this deﬁcit, making the number of events expected more
similar at energies above 4.5 MeV. Since the normalized
spectrum provides the lowest signal, in the computation
of the upper limits we have considered this option be-
ing the most conservative: this assumption means to at-
tribute 61.1 ± 1.7 events among our candidates to reac-
tor ¯νe.

−1.3 TNU and 84.8+1.5

3.2.3. Atmospheric neutrinos

The most serious background to the detection of
DSNB ﬂuxes at energies above 10 MeV is induced by
the atmospheric neutrinos, i.e., the ν’s and ¯ν’s generated
in the decay of secondary particles produced in the inter-
actions of primary cosmic rays with Earth atmosphere.
Atmospheric neutrinos may give both Charged Cur-
rent (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) interactions with
the atoms constituting the Borexino scintillator. The
most copious isotopes are 1H (6.00 × 1031/kton), 12C
(4.46 × 1031/kton), and 13C (5.00 × 1029/kton). Besides

Borexino scintillator, the resulting interaction rates are
261/year in the total IV plus buﬀer mass (1181.5 tons).
After the simulation of detector response and by apply-
ing the same selection cuts as for real data (Sec. 3.1),
9643 IBD-like events were selected out of 2.3 × 106 in-
teractions. They do correspond to 6.5 IBD-like events
in the present analysis statistics of 6.8 years and in the
equivalent ¯νe energy window 1.8–16.8 MeV.

The uncertainty on this result comes mostly from
two sources. Atmospheric ﬂuxes are assumed to be
known with ∼25% precision [42, 41]. To quantify
the uncertainty related to the interaction cross sections
we repeated the calculation by using GENIE version
2.12.10 and the rest of the simulation chain, unchanged:
the expected number of events decreased by 36%, prob-
ably as a consequence of the cross sections and intranu-
clear cascade models’ diﬀerences between GENIE ver-
sions. In order to account for other small and unknown
uncertainty sources, and assuming that these uncertain-
ties are independent, we consider a conservative uncer-
tainty of 50%.

In the light of the large uncertainty on this back-
ground source, a conservative choice would be to not
consider it at all in the upper limit calculations on
extraterrestrial ¯νe ﬂuxes. Nonetheless, since it repre-
sents the main source of background at energies above
∼10 MeV, we decided to quote both limits obtained with
and without atmospheric neutrino background.

3.2.4. Random coincidences and other non-¯νe back-

grounds

The space and time correlation of the ¯νe interactions
helps to reduce the coincidences rate of non-correlated
events. Since they are mainly due to gammas penetrat-
ing the detector from outside, the choice of the ﬁducial
volume (25 cm from the IV) is useful to guarantee an
eﬀective suppression. To quantify the fraction of per-
sisting events, we used an oﬀ-time coincidence window
of 2–20 s. The number of selected coincidences is then
scaled to the 1260 µs wide time window adopted in the
¯νe search. A correction factor has to be applied: it takes
into account the smaller loss of exposure in the case
of the ¯νe candidates search due to the fact that the 2 s
muon vetoing windows before the prompt and the de-
layed events are partially overlapped while in the case
of the random coincidence search they are not. The
correction factor is about 10%, and it was estimated by
means of a toy MC from the measured muon rate: the
total number of expected accidental coincidences after
the correction is 0.418 ± 0.006 in the whole data sam-
ple.

ing 100% eﬃciency in the period December 2007 - October 2017,

the IBD reaction itself, there are several reactions with
12C and 13C nuclei that may, in some cases, mimic the
IBD. They have the form of ν + A → ν(l) + n + · · · + A(cid:48),
where A is the target nucleus, A(cid:48) is the nuclear remnant,
l is the charged lepton produced in case of CC processes,
n is the neutron, and dots are for other produced parti-
cles like nucleons (including additional neutrons) and
mesons (mostly π and K mesons). The calculation of
the induced signal by all these processes is of course
quite a complicated task: a dedicated simulation code
was therefore developed to precisely quantify this back-
ground in Borexino.

Here we summarize the key points:

for energies
above 100 MeV, the atmospheric neutrino ﬂuxes are
taken from the HKKM2014 model [41], while below
100 MeV the ﬂuxes from the FLUKA code [42] have
been adopted. The models were chosen as the most up-
to-date and precise in respective energy regions. The
neutrino ﬂuxes averaged from all directions are con-
sidered, since the scintillation light is isotropical and it
does not provide sensitivity to the direction. We calcu-
lated the ﬂavor oscillations during neutrino propagation
through the Earth, including the matter eﬀects, with the
modiﬁed Prob3++ software [43] that comprises 1 km
wide constant-density layers according to the PREM
Earth’s model [44]. The neutrino interactions with 12C,
13C, and 1H nuclei are generated with the GENIE Neu-
trino MC code (version 3.0.0, tune G18 10b) [45]. GE-
NIE output ﬁnal state particles are used as input par-
ticles for the G4Bx2 Borexino MC [24] that allows us
to reproduce the detector response. Since the Borexino
MC chain results in output ﬁles with the same format as
real data, the same events ﬁltering code can be applied.
Taking into account the number of particles in the

8

Among the other minor non-¯νe backgrounds are
(α,n) processes: neutrons of energies up to 7.3 MeV
may be emitted by 13C(α,n)16O reactions following the
210Po decay, as investigated by KamLAND [46].
In
Borexino, due to low level of intrinsic 210Po contami-
nation, this source of background yields as few as ∼0.2
events in the present statistics that can be neglected in
the upper limit calculation, always by taking a conser-
vative approach.

3.2.5. Summary of backgrounds

ground rates.

3.3. Selected events

With the main DAQ system, 101 ¯νe candidates have
been identiﬁed, passing all selection cuts. A cross-
check in parallel was then performed for each candidate
by using the data from the FADC system that provides
a linear dynamic range to higher energies and an inde-
pendent input for pulse shape analysis. The properties
of the observed events for each energy bin and the ex-
pected backgrounds can be found in Table 2. All the
candidates have energies below 7.8 MeV, and most of
them are concentrated in the very ﬁrst energy bins (1.8–
4.8 MeV), a feature understandable on the base of the
spectral shape of the dominant backgrounds, i.e., geo-¯νe
and reactor ¯νe (see Fig. 3). An excess of the measured
events with respect to backgrounds is clearly visible in
the lowest energy bin (1.8–2.8 MeV). The reason is that
for the geo-¯νe signal, we have assumed the Minimal Ra-
diogenic Earth’s model, while this excess is likely an
indication for mantle geo-¯νe. Note that above 2.8 MeV
(close to geo-neutrino spectrum endpoint) we observe
62 candidates, while 63 ± 2 events are expected from
the backgrounds, in perfect agreement.

Figure 3: The number of measured events (black data point) is com-
pared for each energy bin with the expected backgrounds (blue – geo-
¯νe, red – reactor ¯νe, green – atmospheric ν) (Sec. 3.2).

3.4. Model-independent upper limits

The model-independent limit for electron antineu-
trino ﬂux (Φ¯νe ) in each energy bin (i) is deﬁned by the
equation:

Φ¯νe,i =

N90,i
< σ > ·ε · Np · T

(4)

where N90 is the 90% C.L. upper limit for the num-
ber of antineutrino interactions obtained by following
the Feldman-Cousins approach [47], <σ> is the mean
cross-section of Inverse Beta Decay calculated accord-
ing to [48] for each energy bin, ε=(0.850 ± 0.015) is the
average detection eﬃciency, Np = (1.32±0.06)×1031 is
the number of protons in the Borexino average ﬁducial
volume mass and T = 2485 days is the total live-time.

New Borexino limits are shown in Fig. 4. The other
limits existing in literature are quoted on the same plot.
Due to almost ﬁve-fold increase in statistics, we im-
proved our previously published limits [21] by a factor
of 2.5 on average. Below 8 MeV, Borexino limits are
the only existing, thanks to the high energy resolution,
the low intrinsic backgrounds, and the small reactor ¯νe
ﬂux at the Gran Sasso site.

Due to the large uncertainty of the prediction for
the atmospheric ¯νe signal, we show only more conser-
vative limits obtained without this background source.
Table 2 contains Borexino results obtained both with
and without taking into account atmospheric neutrino
background.

3.5. Limits on diﬀuse supernovae background

The energy spectra of the observed ¯νe events can be
compared with the expectations for the diﬀerent astro-
nomical source models to get hints about the presence

trino background. The reactor signal was normalized to the Daya Bay
measurement (Sec. 3.2.2).

sponding ﬂuxes.
In general, for the supernova core-
collapses, a unique model does not exist. The basic
ideas were established in 1930s [49], but the nature of
the shock wave revival and explosion mechanism are
still not fully understood. The main problem of the
supernovae explosion mechanism theory is an expla-
nation for the energy transfer of the gravitational en-
ergy to the stellar envelope and initiation of the outward
shock wave. The mean energy of the emitted neutrinos
from Supernova collapse depends on this mechanism
and nowadays could only be extracted from numerical
simulations.

the
In current work, we used, as references,
1d numerical simulations performed by two groups
([52],[53]). These models were chosen because they are
long-term simulations and yield a mean energy value for
neutrinos emitted during the collapse. In the case of the
model by Nakazato et al. [52], the expected DSNB ﬂux
at the Earth, as a function of the neutrino energy, is di-
rectly provided as the result of the numerical simulation
of SN core-collapse and is made available on a webpage
[52]. For the present study we have selected the predic-
tions for neutrino normal mass hierarchy, including the
oscillation eﬀects.
In the case of the Hudepohl et al.
model [53], only the average energies of ¯νe emitted dur-
ing the core-collapse are provided. We have therefore
calculated the DSNB ﬂux on the Earth, starting from
Eq. 1. The emission neutrino spectrum in our calcula-
tion is parameterized as:

(90% C.L.)) for E ¯νe > 17.3 MeV [19].

3.6. Limits on νe → ¯νe conversion in the Sun due to

spin-ﬂavor precession
The presence of antineutrinos in original neutrino
ﬂuxes can be a consequence of neutrino electromagnetic
interactions induced by the non-zero neutrino magnetic
moment (µν) (see [58] for a recent review of neu-
trino electromagnetic properties). Being roughly pro-
portional to the neutrino mass [59], µν is expected to be
non-zero at the light of oscillation paradigm with mas-
sive neutrinos. Neutrinos with anomalous µν interact-
ing with strong magnetic ﬁelds in the Sun may undergo
spin-ﬂavor precession (SFP), which changes their helic-
ity and, possibly, ﬂavor [60]. Dirac neutrinos under SFP
transit into a sterile right-handed state, while for Ma-
jorana neutrinos spin-ﬂip is equivalent to να − ¯νβ con-
version. Under the CPT conservation, this process for
Majorana neutrinos is necessarily accompanied by the
ﬂavor change, and thus, the appearance of ¯νe in the Sun
can be described as a combined eﬀect of SFP and neu-
trino oscillations in matter (MSW eﬀect):

SFP

The tightest limit on the νe − ¯νe conversion proba-
bility was obtained in the KamLAND experiment and is
equal to 5.3·10−5 (90% C.L.) [18]. In Borexino, a study
of νe − ¯νe conversion was previously performed in [21]
using ∼2 years of data acquired during Phase I. In the
following, we update our previous results using a larger
dataset.

3.6.1. Search for antineutrinos from the 8B reaction

The same IBD candidates as for the previous studies
have been used here to search for the ¯νe from the con-
version of 8B neutrinos having energies up to 16.8 MeV.
We developed separate analyses in two energy regions,
1.8–7.8 MeV (LER), and 7.8–16.8 MeV (HER).

In the HER, we used the Feldman-Cousins ap-
proach [47] to get the 90% C.L. upper limit (N90) on
the antineutrino interaction rate for this energy region.
Then the limit on the antineutrino ﬂux (Φlim) is obtained
by following the same approach as in subsection 3.4,
Eq. 4. The average IBD cross section <σ> considered
in this study is weighted over the undistorted spectrum
of 8B neutrinos.

The analysis in the LER is instead performed by
applying the spectral ﬁt procedure developed for geo-
neutrino studies [32]. The ﬁt is performed assuming

We observe that the choice of the DSNB model does

inclusion of the atmospheric neutrino background, with
a diﬀerence up to factor of 2.7 in the energy range 7.8–
16.8 MeV. Our more conservative limit for the 7.8–16.8
MeV range, Φ¯νe < 112.3 cm−2s−1 (90% C.L.) is slightly
better with respect to the one obtained by the Kam-
LAND collaboration [18] (Φ¯νe < 139 cm−2s−1 (90%
C.L.)) that indeed refers to a larger energy range (8.3–
31.8 MeV), and it is to some extent complementary

neutrinos; (2) ¯νe-like background from accidental coin-
cidences, (α, n) reactions and cosmogenic isotopes; (3)
8B antineutrino spectrum. Assuming that SFP proba-
bility is not energy dependent, the spectral shape of 8B
antineutrino coincides with the neutrino spectrum.

In the HER we expect 0.3 background events in
the region of interest, assuming the reactor background
spectrum is normalized to Daya Bay measurement [36]
and the absence of the atmospheric neutrino back-
ground. Zero events observed in this region corresponds
to N90 = 2.15, and a limit on the antineutrino ﬂux

φ¯ν(E > 7.8 MeV) < 138.0 cm−2s−1.

As the region above 7.8 MeV contains 36% of the 8B
ﬂux, the limit in the whole energy range is correspond-
ingly φ¯ν < 383.7 cm−2s−1 (90% C.L.). Taking the Stan-
dard Solar Model (SSM) values of 8B neutrino ﬂux un-
der assumptions of high (HZ) and low (LZ) solar metal-
licity [61], i.e., the abundance of heavy elements in the
Sun, one can obtain limits on the νe−¯νe conversion prob-
ability:

per limit for the number of events of N90 = 13.3, by
proﬁling the χ2 of the ﬁt result as a function of 8B an-
tineutrino interaction rate. This limit can be improved
by combining both energy regions in the ﬁt, and the ﬁnal
result is N90 = 6.1, corresponding to 2.19 events above
7.8 MeV and the conversion probability of:
νe→¯νe < 7.2 · 10−5(90% C.L.),
pHZ
νe→¯νe < 8.7 · 10−5(90% C.L.).

The limit calculated with the combined approach
appears to be weaker than that obtained from the analy-
sis of the HER only, but we conservatively consider this
result as the ﬁnal one.

3.6.2. Neutrino magnetic moment

We have estimated limits on the eﬀective magnetic
moment of solar neutrinos, assuming SFP in the solar
core and the convective zone, separately.

In the 8B neutrino production region, conversion
probability depends on the transverse component of the
strength of the toroidal solar magnetic ﬁeld. Neutrino
magnetic moment can be derived as in [62]:

µν ≤ 7.4 × 10−7 ·

(cid:33)1/2

(cid:32)

p(νe − ¯νe)
sin2 2θ12

·

µB
B⊥[kG]

.

(16)

12

Taking our ﬁnal result for the conversion probability
under the assumption of high metallicity, namely p(νe −
¯νe) < 7.2 · 10−5 (90% C.L.) and sin2 θ12 = 0.297 [35],
one can obtain

µν < 6.9 · 10−9B−1

⊥ [kG] · µB (90% C.L.).

(17)

Due to limited possibilities of magnetic ﬁeld mea-
surements in the innermost part of the Sun, only
marginal values of B in the solar core are provided
by solar physics. The most stringent observational
limits come from measurements of solar oblateness,
which could be distorted by strong magnetic ﬁelds in
the core [63, 64]. According to these investigations,
B < 7 MG. Theoretical studies of the stability of the
toroidal magnetic ﬁeld in the rotating radiative zone [65]
provide stronger constraints on the magnetic ﬁeld: B <
600 G. These estimations correspond to upper limits of
the neutrino magnetic moment between 1.14 · 10−8µB
and 1.08·10−12µB (90% C.L.). The latter is stronger than
the current limit from astrophysical observations [66],
while the former is overlaid by other measurements.

SFP can also occur in the convective zone of the Sun
via interaction with turbulent magnetic ﬁelds [67, 68,
69]. Considering the expression for the νe → ¯νe conver-
sion probability from [69] and neutrino oscillation pa-
rameters from [35], the neutrino magnetic moment can
be expressed as

µν ≤ 8.0 × 10−8 · (p(νe − ¯νe))1/2 · B−1[kG] · µB.

(18)

As the estimated strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
convective zone is of the order of 104 G [70], the corre-
sponding magnetic moment limit is µν < 3.4 · 10−11µB
at 90% C.L. This value is close to that obtained with the
Borexino analysis of solar neutrino data [71]. Similar
results can be obtained assuming low metallicity SSM.

3.6.3. Study of the conversion in Low Energy Region

At energies below the IBD threshold, ¯νe still inter-
acts via elastic scattering with electrons and thus con-
tribute to the recoil electrons spectrum. Besides the
shape distortion, the conversion of neutrino into an-
tineutrino should reduce the detected neutrino rate since
the ¯ν − e cross section is substantially smaller than that
for electron neutrinos. Therefore, by constraining solar
neutrino ﬂuxes with the SSM prediction [61], one can
gain additional sensitivity to the conversion rate. It is
worth mentioning that this detection technique is also
sensitive to spectral shape distortion due to the electro-
magnetic ν − e interaction induced by the non-zero neu-
trino magnetic moment. This fact was previously used

by Borexino in Ref. [71] to put a strong bound on µν
without assumptions on the solar magnetic ﬁeld.

The previous limit on neutrino-antineutrino conver-
sion (pνe→¯νe ) obtained by Borexino using the method de-
scribed in this section is [21]:

pronounced compared to νe’s case. Thus, Borexino is
sensitive to νe → ¯νe conversion only.

Taking into account antineutrino component due to
ν → ¯ν conversion, the observed spectra in the detector
are given by the expression7:

pνe→¯νe < 0.35 (90%C.L.)

(19)

In the present work, we improve this limit following
the recent progress of Borexino in solar neutrino detec-
tion [8].

In this study we assume MSW as the leading con-
version mechanism, and the ν → ¯ν conversion as a sub-
dominant process.

The diﬀerential cross section of neutrino elastic
scattering of electrons for all neutrino ﬂavors is given
by the expression:

where GF is the Fermi constant, me is the electron mass,
and E and T are neutrino and recoil electron kinetic en-
ergies, respectively. The coupling constants at tree level
are given by expressions:

for α = e,
for α = µ, τ,

gαR = sin2 θW

for α = e, µ, τ.

(21)

Note that νµ and ντ have the same cross section due

to equal coupling constants.

The diﬀerential cross section for antineutrinos has
the same form as (20), with gL and gR coupling con-
stants swapped. Their values for all three ﬂavors are:

gL = sin2 θW −

1
2

gR = sin2 θW .

(22)

Electron neutrinos interact with electrons by both
CC and NC, while ¯νes interact by NC only and νe has
an approximately three times larger cross section than
¯νe. Moreover, the swap of the coupling constants aﬀects
the second and the third energy-dependent terms in (20)
and, therefore, distorts the shape of the spectrum.

µ/τR ≈ g2

Both νµ/τ and ¯νµ/τ interact with electrons by NC.
Since g2
µ/τL, the shape and normalization of
the spectra are almost the same for neutrinos and an-
tineutrinos, and the eﬀect of the shape distortion is less

The same event selection criteria and spectral ﬁt pro-
cedures developed by the Borexino collaboration for
studies of solar neutrinos are used in the data analysis
(see [8, 27, 71]) . The 7Be contribution was modiﬁed to
account for the hypothetical νe → ¯νe conversion. This
spectral component provides the most sensitive probe
of the possible appearance of the ¯ν due to the signiﬁcant
7Be response changes both in the shape and the ampli-
tude. Contributions from other solar neutrino compo-
nents are less pronounced.

Solar neutrino ﬂuxes Φν are constrained in the anal-
ysis with high and low solar metallicity SSM predic-
tions [61]. Uncertainties related to the target mass de-
termination and oscillation parameters were found to be
small compared to those associated with SSM-ﬂux pre-
diction and are accounted for by using the SSM-penalty
terms.

The ﬁtting procedure consists in maximization of
the multivariate likelihood function L(pνe→¯νe , (cid:126)θ ) for a
set of pνe→¯νe values. Then the likelihood proﬁle was
analyzed to determine the upper bound for pνe→¯νe .

The statistics selected for the present study corre-
spond to data acquired from December 14, 2011 until
May 21, 2016 (1291.51 days × 71.3 tons) of ﬁducial ex-
posure, i.e., the same period already used for the direct
study of the magnetic moment of neutrino at detection
in Ref. [71]. The recent advances in understanding of
the detector response allowed the ﬁt to be performed in
the energy range 0.19 MeV < Te < 2.93 MeV, which
includes pp, 7Be, pep, and CNO electron-recoil spectra

7For clarity, we present this formula in energy units, omitting the

convolution with the energy response function of the detector

The possibility for neutrino emissions correlated
with solar ﬂares was ﬁrst advanced in the eighties by
R. Davis [11, 12] as an explanation for the excess of
events observed in several runs taken by the Homestake
Cl-Ar experiment. Homestake run 117 was taken at a
time of intense X12 ﬂare (ﬂare class X12 corresponds
to the 12 × 10−4 W/m2 intensity of the ﬂux in the X-ray
band within 1–8 Å) on June 4, 1991. Based on the num-
ber of observed extra events in that run, an allowed band
for the neutrino ﬂuence, compatible with the data, was
indicated in [16].

Here we present a search for νx and ¯νx (x = e, µ, τ)
from a variety of the solar ﬂares by looking for their
elastic scattering on electrons in the Borexino scintilla-
tor.

Information about the ﬂares is taken from the GOES
database [73]. The database provides the ﬂare’s date,
the start and end time, and the class. Assuming the neu-
trino ﬂux would be proportional to the ﬂare’s intensity,
we consider the most intense ﬂares of M and X classes,
which correspond to intensities of the photon ﬂux higher
than 10−5 W/m2 and 10−4 W/m2, respectively, in the X-
ray band within 1–8 Å.

The analysis is based on data collected between
November 2009 and October 2017. A total of 798 ﬂares
are selected during this period. The most intense (X9.3)
ﬂare event was registered on September 06, 2017.

i

The followed approach is to search for an excess
of single events above the measured background at the
time of a ﬂare. For the i-th ﬂare we choose the time
window ∆T S IG
equal to the ﬂare’s duration, according
to the database. The background is calculated in a time
window of the same length ∆T BKG
, opened before the
i
∆T S IG
. In case the previous ﬂare occurred within this
i
time window, ∆T BKG
. We
require at least 95% of Borexino’s up time for both
windows: 472 ﬂares of 798 fulﬁll this criterium, with
an overall data coverage in both Σ∆T S IG
and Σ∆T BKG
of 99.9%. The integral intensity over the 472 selected
ﬂares is 1.78 × 10−2 W/m2, i.e., factor of ∼15 larger
than intensity of the ﬂare occurred during Homestake
run 117.

For a ﬁrst study in the energy range of 1–15 MeV,
the data acquired both by the primary and the FADC
DAQ systems have been used. Events are selected by
vetoing muons and muon daughters both in the ∆T S IG
and ∆T BKG
windows: a 2 s veto is applied after muons
crossing ID, and a 2 ms veto after muons crossing OD.
Single events having energy E = 1 − 15 MeV are then
selected without any ﬁducial volume cut.

[8]. In this lower energy range, the number of triggered
PMT’s (Ndt1) in the time window 230 ns is preferred as
an energy estimator. More detailed information on the
analysis procedures and event selection could be found
in Ref. [8, 27, 71].

The resulting likelihood proﬁles for HZ- and LZ-
SSM are shown in Fig. 6. One can obtain bounds for
the fraction of pνe→¯νe for the HZ-SSM case by numerical
integration of the proﬁles in Fig. 6:

pHZ
νe→¯νe < 0.14 (90%C.L.)

and for LZ-SSM:

pLZ
νe→¯νe < 0.08 (90%C.L.)

A conservative limit is given by Eq.(26), and it pro-
vides an improvement by a factor of two with respect to
the limit in Eq.(19), previously obtained in [21].

4. Study of events correlated with solar ﬂares

Flares are caused by the restructuring of the solar
magnetic ﬁeld, which leads to the acceleration of pro-
tons and other charged particles and ions. Neutrinos
could be generated in the decays of pions, which are
abundantly produced in pp- and pα-collisions in the
ﬂare’s region.

Neutrino spectrum depends on the spectrum of
initially accelerated colliding particles and is poorly
known. Nonetheless, for various sets of input param-
eters the mean neutrino energy is expected to be around
10 MeV [72]. Production of ¯νe is suppressed with re-
spect to νe due to a higher threshold of π− generation in
pp-collisions.

i

and ∆T BKG

sis, an independent study of the data acquired by the
primary DAQ alone was performed. This study was
done for the same data-taking period and the same
∆T S IG
windows, but in the energy range
i
E = 0.25 − 15 MeV. Events were selected by applying
a dynamic ﬁducial volume cut of 145 tons (75 cm from
the shape of the IV) to suppress the external γ radioac-
tivity. The muon veto duration was chosen to be of only
0.3 s, because at energies below 3 MeV, the cosmogenic
isotopes are not the dominant background.

Figure 7 shows the energy spectrum of selected sin-
gle events measured by the FADC system within 1–
15 MeV range (red line) and by the primary DAQ sys-
tem within 0.25–15 MeV range (grey), for the inte-
. The diﬀerence between
grated time exposure Σ∆T S IG
i
this spectrum and the one measured for the Σ∆T BKG
is
shown in the inset. No statistically signiﬁcant excess of
events is observed in correlation with the selected ﬂares.
In order to obtain the ﬂuence upper limits for ﬂare-
correlated neutrinos we used the same approach as in
[9]: the ﬂuence limit for neutrinos of energy Eν is cal-
culated according to the equation:

i

Φν(Eν) = N90(Eν)
Neσeﬀ(Eν)

,

(28)

where Ne is the number of electrons in the Borexino
scintillator, that is, Ne = 9.2 · 1031 for the whole IV and
Ne = 4.8 · 1031 for the 145 tons FV. Since the scatter-
ing of monoenergetic neutrinos with energy Eν oﬀ elec-
trons leads to recoil electrons with a Compton-like con-
=
tinuous energy spectrum with maximum energy T max
ν /(me + 2Eν), σeﬀ(Eν) is the eﬀective cross section
2E2
for an interacting neutrino with energy Eν to recoil elec-
trons with energy T in the interval (Tth > 0, T max
) with
100% detection eﬃciency. This eﬀective cross section
can be expressed as:

ergy resolution of the detector, with T − = T − 3σT (T )
and T + = T + 3σT (T ). The numerator in Eq. 28,
N90(Eν), is the 90% C.L. upper limit on the number
of ﬂare-associated events per one ﬂare, due to neutri-
nos with energy Eν, calculated as N90 = (Q(0.9) ×

The procedure was repeated for neutrino energies Eν
from 0.5 to 3.5 MeV in increments of 0.1 MeV, from
3.5 to 5 MeV in increments of 0.5 MeV, and for Eν >
5 MeV in 1.0 MeV steps. In order to maximize the sig-
nal to background ratio, the lower integration limits Tth
from Eq. 29 was optimized for diﬀerent neutrino en-
ergies considering the shape of the spectrum decreas-
ing with energy (Fig. 7). The three blue lines indicated
in Fig. 7 with indices 1, 2, and 3 show the thresholds
of electron energies Tth, for which Eν was set to (1.5,
3.5) MeV, (4.0, 5.0) MeV, and (6.0, 15.0) MeV intervals,
respectively.

In order to set the ﬂuence limits for ﬂare-correlated
neutrinos (antineutrinos) of electron and (µ + τ) ﬂavors
individually, the corresponding cross section in Eq. 29
was set to σνe (σ¯νe ) and σνµ,τ (σ¯νµ,τ), respectively. The

In this paper we investigated the possible anti-
neutrino ﬂuxes from diﬀuse astrophysical sources such
as relic supernovae or the conversion of solar neutri-
nos into anti-neutrinos in the magnetic ﬁeld of the Sun.
The extreme radiopurity of the Borexino detector al-
lowed us to set new limits on diﬀuse supernova neu-
trino background for ¯νe in the previously unexplored
energy region below 8 MeV, and to get, even with very
conservative assumptions, competitive results between
7.8 and 16.8 MeV. The new search for ¯νe appearance
in solar neutrino ﬂuxes was performed both in the en-
ergy range 1.8 < E ¯νe < 16.8 MeV and 0.9 < E ¯νe <
3.3 MeV. Thanks to an almost 5-fold increase in statis-
tics, we improved previous Borexino limits on neutrino-
to-antineutrino conversion (pν→¯ν) by a factor of two. A
model-independent study was also presented.

Finally, the most stringent up-to-date limits on ﬂu-
ences for all neutrino ﬂavors from solar ﬂares below 3–
7 MeV have been set. An intense solar ﬂare was ex-
cluded as a possible source of the observed excess of
events in run 117 of the Cl-Ar Homestake experiment.

Figure 8 and Table 4 show Borexino limits obtained

[16] and an allowed band for the neutrino ﬂuence that
would have explained the Homestake run 117 excess of
events are also shown for comparison.

As of today, Borexino sets the strongest limits on
ﬂuences of all neutrino ﬂavors from the solar ﬂares be-
low 3–7 MeV. Under assumption that neutrino ﬂux is
proportional to the ﬂare’s intensity, Borexino’s data ex-
cludes an intense solar ﬂare occurred during run 117 of
the Cl-Ar Homestake experiment as a possible source of
the observed excess of events.
