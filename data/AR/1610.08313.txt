Abstract

Topological magnetic textures – like skyrmions – have become a major player in the design of next-

generation magnetic storage technology due to their stability and the control of their motion by ultra-low

current densities. A major challenge to develop this new skyrmion-based technology is to achieve the con-

trolled and deterministic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of complex setups. We demon-

strate a solution to this challenge by showing how to create skyrmions and other magnetic textures in

ferromagnetic thin ﬁlms by means of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-

Moriya interactions. This is possible by exploiting a static loss of stability arising from the interplay of

current-induced spin-transfer torque and a spatially inhomogeneous magnetization, which can be achieved,

e.g., by locally engineering the anisotropy, the magnetic ﬁeld, or other magnetic interactions. The magnetic

textures are created controllably, efﬁciently, and periodically with a period that can be tuned by the applied

current strength. We propose speciﬁc experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt

based materials, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. We show that adding chiral interactions

will not inﬂuence the basics of the generations but then inﬂuence the consequent dynamics with respect to

the stabilization of topological textures. Our ﬁndings allow for the production of skyrmions on demand in

simple ferromagnetic thin ﬁlms by homogeneous DC currents.

INTRODUCTION

Technologies based on spintronics have become integral parts of our world. Current mass-

market magnetic memory technologies primarily rely on spintronic devices that couple to the

magnetic ﬁelds created by domains, which brings inherent limits in storage density and speed. The

next-generation, high-performance magnetic memory devices rely on the ability to efﬁciently and

controllably create and manipulate magnetic textures by purely electrical means. Magnetic storage

devices based on the racetrack memory idea, where traditionally the information is encoded via

magnetic domain walls, has been proposed as a design of ultra-dense, low-cost and low-power

storage technologies.1 However, several difﬁculties arise to efﬁciently control the domain walls: i)

large current densities are needed to move them; ii) nanowires of high quality are required as edge

roughnesses will modify the shape of the domain walls or even destroy them; and iii) the spacing

between two magnetic domains can hardly be reduced below 30-40 nm.2

These challenges might be overcome by realizing racetrack memory devices based on mag-

netic skyrmions.2–5 They were observed for the ﬁrst time in 20096 and theoretically discussed

already more than 25 years ago.7–9 Since 2009 skyrmions have been detected in various bulk

materials10–12 and thin ﬁlms.13–18 They have also been shown to be stable up to room temperature,

and skyrmions occur in different sizes. Skyrmions are particularly interesting for device relevant

systems due to their special properties: i) Skyrmions are particle like and are usually repelled by

smooth boundaries, so they do not touch the edges of the sample as domain walls always do; ii)

they are topologically non-trivial and therefore more stable than other magnetic textures; iii) they

can be efﬁciently manipulated by ultra-low electric currents,19–24 much smaller than the currents

needed to move domain walls in magnetic wires; and iv) the spacing between bits could be of

the order of the skyrmion diameter, which allows for a much denser storage compared to domain

walls.2

To efﬁciently build high-performance skyrmion-based devices a reliable and controllable way

to create skyrmions is needed. So far several techniques to obtain single skyrmions have been

proposed.18,25–36 However, most of them either require specialized setups or artiﬁcially tuned

parameters. One recent example is the use of an inhomogeneous current distribution coupled

to a chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).28 This set-up provides a rather uncon-

trolled skyrmion source where the skrymion creation is a “random process” similar to bubble

creation in hydrodynamics. Furthermore, most of the theoretical studies of the dynamics32,37–49

and creation33,50,51 of these spin textures imply or assume that the presence of a twisting micro-

scopic interactions, such as DMI, is required for their creation.

Here we present a mechanism to periodically produce magnetic textures in simple thin ﬁlm

geometries by means of a homogeneous DC current and a spatially inhomogeneous magneti-

zation without requiring any standard “twisting” interactions. To propose a concrete setup we

consider an experimentally realizable pinning center, that creates the magnetic inhomogeneity,

see Fig. 1. The magnetic textures can be created efﬁciently and controllably, as illustrated in

Fig. 2. This mechanism relies physically on a local static loss of stability created by the com-

bined interaction of current-induced spin-transfer torque and the pinning center leading to a bi-

furcation into a spatio-temporal period pattern. It is similar to our recent work in one dimen-

sion leading to current induced domain wall production52, however in the two-dimensional case

the situation is far more complex. We demonstrate that it is possible to use this mechanism to

create skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs. The inclusion of DMI interactions plays no major role in

their creation process but does affect the subsequent dynamics of the magnetic textures and in

particular ultimately stabilize one member of the pair with the preferred chirality. A recent the-

oretical study focussing primarily on systems with DMI53 have also demonstrated the creation of

skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs, also verifying this in the absence of DMI.

This paper is structured as follows: First we provide a simple physical picture of the skyrmion

formation. As an example, we explicitly describe a experimental setup in which we predict that

skyrmions can be produced via a homogeneous DC current. Then we discuss our main analytical

and numerical results. In particular, we consider skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair production and their

time evolution and discuss the option of a pulse-operation mode of the device. We ﬁrst analyse

the creation process in a setup without DMI interactions and later on include chiral interactions to

study the different time evolution of the created textures. At the end we discuss our results and

allude to experiments that might have already observed the creation mechanism proposed in this

paper.

II. PHYSICAL PICTURE OF MAGNETIC TEXTURE FORMATION BY DC CURRENTS

As it follows from the analytics section described below, a DC current is able to produce mag-

netic textures once there is a magnetic inhomogeneity in the system. To study a concrete and

reproducible example, we focus on the setup illustrated in Fig. 1, consisting of a metallic ferro-

magnetic ﬁlm with a perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy where in a small region of the magnetic

ﬁlm the magnetization is tilted. In this work we realize this tilting by a change in the magne-

tocrystalline anisotropy which acts as a pinning center. We then apply a DC current in an in-plane

direction.

The physical picture of the newly introduced mechanism for topological magnetic texture for-

mation is as follows: i) when ramping up the current strength the current modiﬁes the magnetiza-

tion structure around the pinning center such that the area, where the magnetization is nonuniform,

becomes elongated; ii) the shape and size of the area of the nonuniform magnetization depends on

the strength of the current and microscopic details of the sample. However, since the current cou-

ples to the spatial gradient of the magnetization, it acts mainly on the magnetization in the nonuni-

form area, i.e., near the pinning center; iii) increasing the current density further, above a critical

current density jc, the local static magnetic texture becomes unstable and the current-induced spin-

transfer-torque pushes away the nucleated texture and effectively shed it from the pinning center;

iv) the vicinity of the pinning center is then somewhat restored to its initial state, and the process

can restart, leading to a periodic shedding process if the current is kept constant above jc. Here we

would like to stress that the current density above which the ferromagnetic ground state becomes

unstable is higher than the current densities used to obtain the shedding.52,58,59

The above statements i) can be deduced from the analytics part presented in Sec. IV, ii) are

analogous to the one dimensional case52,59, and iii) can be deduced from a more general perspec-

tive from hydrodynamic theory.60 However what remains unclear from those general arguments

is how these shedded magnetic textures look like. To this end we have performed micromag-

netic simulations and we ﬁnd that different magnetic textures can be shedded (see Supplementary

Material61). In particular, for currents slightly above jc and a small enough pinning center it is

possible to periodically shed skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs.

In the process described above, no twisting interaction is needed. The addition of DMI would

not aid or hinder the periodic creation process of magnetic textures, but will of course be necessary

in a different region of the device to insure long term stability of stored skyrmions, see Sec. V B.

5

It is important to emphasize that the newly introduced periodic texture production mechanism is

a generic and ubiquitous process: neither the directions of the anisotropies nor the details of how

it is locally altered in strength or orientation at the pinning center are crucial. However, in order

to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed generic mechanism, we have speciﬁed

an experimental setup based on CoCrPt thin ﬁlms54–57 to observe the formation of skyrmions by

uniform DC currents in common ferromagnetic materials, as shown in Fig. 1. Locally modifying

the top layer in a small region might reduce the out-of-plane anisotropy leading to an in-plane

tilting of the magnetization within this region, as a practical implementation of the required local

pinning center.

III. MODEL FOR MAGNETIZATION DYNAMICS

To describe the current-induced magnetization dynamics of the considered ferromagnetic thin
ﬁlm we use the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the unit vector ﬁeld ˆM (Ref. 62) generalized

to include spin-torque effects due to the electric current:

(∂t + vs∂x) ˆM = −γ ˆM × Beﬀ + α ˆM ×

(cid:18)

∂t +

(cid:19)

ˆM ,

vs∂x

(1)

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and α and β are the dimensionless Gilbert damping and

−M −1

non-adiabatic spin-transfer-torque parameters. The effective magnetic ﬁeld is given by Beﬀ =
s (δF [ ˆM ]/δ ˆM ), where F [ ˆM ] describes the free energy of the system and Ms is the satura-
tion magnetization. We decompose the free energy F into two parts F = F0 + Ftwist where F0

consists of isotropic exchange, anisotropy term and dipolar interactions:

F0[ ˆM ] =

Aex(∇ ˆM )2 + Π( ˆM ) −

Ms

ˆM · H d( ˆM )

(cid:21)

(2)

where Aex is the exchange constant, Π( ˆM ) describes the functional form of the anisotropy energy
and the last term describes the dipolar interactions. Ftwist describes a twisting interaction like the

DMI interaction, which we set to zero in the ﬁrst part of the numerics. Thereby we show that

such a twisting term is not crucial for the creation of the magnetic textures. In the latter part of

the numerics we do, however, explicitly consider different twisting terms. The applied uniform

DC current along the x direction enters the equation via the effective spin velocity, vs = ξj with

ξ = gP µB/(2eMs), where g is the g-factor, P is the current polarization, µB is the Bohr magneton,

e is the electron charge, and j is the current.

IV. RESULTS: ANALYTICS

In this section we demonstrate the general aspects of this new type of magnetic texture produc-

tion in thin ﬁlms. We show below that spin textures are periodically created above a critical current

jc, with a period T ∼ (j − jc)−1/2. This periodic texture production is quite general and does not

depend on the details of the microscopic Hamiltonian for a large class of magnetic systems. How-

ever, the details of the process, such as the value of the critical current jc or the prefactor of the

periodic scaling, do depend on the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian. Recently we have

analysed the same mechanism for one-dimensional nano-wires,52 where a pinning center leads to

current-induced periodic domain wall production. The one-dimensional problem is analytically

solvable including the calculation of the shape of the emerging magnetic texture of the domain

wall, whereas the situation in two dimensions is far more complex. Analytically it is still possible

to derive the shedding period based on generalized arguments as shown below. By general topol-

ogy arguments one can infer that the winding number during the creation process is conserved, but

the precise shape of the produced magnetic textures cannot be calculated analytically.

The only assumptions that enter our analytical calculations are that i) the magnetic free energy

density of the system is translationally invariant outside the pinning area, and ii) that we neglect the

non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque term. The critical scaling related to the type of instability may

be transformed by non-adiabatic corrections, but the general ﬁnding of periodic production of spin

textures by DC currents is expected to remain valid. Below we discuss the main analytical strategy

and ﬁndings, whereas a full derivation of our analytical results can be found in the Supplementary

Material.61

The critical current density is deﬁned by the instance when the magnetic texture is about to rip

off. Because the current density couples to the gradient of the magnetization via the spin-transfer

torque, the critical current density is deﬁned by the gradient of the magnetization proﬁle at the

pinning center going to zero:

∂x

ˆM c(jc; r = 0) = 0,

(3)

where ˆM c(r) is the magnetization proﬁle obtained by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equa-
tion for a current density jc. A sketch of the magnetization proﬁle for different current strengths is

shown in Fig. 3.

The period at which magnetic textures are created is derived by combining two crucial ar-
guments: one arises from the “just still static limit” (j0 (cid:46) jc) and the other one from the “just

7

FIG. 3. Schematic plot for which the local pinning direction is along the x direction, and the global pinning

direction is along the z direction, i.e., Mx(x = 0) = 1 for all current strengths. At the critical current all

derivatives at x = 0 are zero.

dynamic limit” (j (cid:38) jc). For the ﬁrst one, the crucial point to note is that at a current j0 slightly
smaller than the critical current (j0 (cid:46) jc) the magnetization proﬁle will not differ too much from
the critical one besides being shifted by a small distance x0: ˆM 0(r) ≡ ˆM c(r − x0ex) + δ ˆM .

Solving the LLG in the static limit with this ansatz yields

jc − j0 ∼ x2
0.

(4)

This equation establishes the relation between the spatial shift of the critical solution, x0, and the

current j0. As a check we note that i) for x0 = 0, j0 and the critical current jc coincide, and that

ii) the difference jc − j0 is second order in x0, as expected from perturbation theory arguments.

For currents just larger than the critical current jc, the static solutions are unstable. Therefore,

to obtain information about the dynamics of the magnetization conﬁguration, a justiﬁed ansatz for

the magnetization at an applied current j is a sum of M 0 (with a time dependent shift x0) and a

small perturbation: M (r, t) = M 0(r; x0(t)) + m(r, t). Here, M 0(r) is the static magnetization

conﬁguration for the shift x0 which can be parametrized by a current j0 using Eq. (4). For this

ansatz, the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation has a direct solution with m ≡ 0 and

∂tx0 = j − j0,

(5)

implying that the velocity of the magnetic texture is proportional to the applied current.

8

Solving Eq. (4) for j0 and inserting it in Eq. (5) yields the period of the magnetic texture

formation:

V. RESULTS: NUMERICS

T ∼ (j − jc)−1/2.

We have performed micromagnetic simulations with various setups and various conﬁgura-

tions, using both MicroMagnum63 including additional self-written software extensions as well

as MuMax3.64 For details and parameters used see the Methods Section (Sec. VIII) and for a sum-

mary table of the parameters see the Supplementary Material.61 In the ﬁrst part we focus on the

periodic texture formation, in particular on the skyrmion and anti-skyrmion creation itself and try

to isolate the mechanism to show that DMI is not important for their creation. We analyse the

shedding and the time evolution. After that we consider the shedding process in the presence of

the generalized anisotropic DMI65,66 which after the skyrmion and antiskyrmion pairs are created,

support the stabilization of the skyrmion or the antiskyrmion, depending on the details and the

signs of the entries of the DMI tensor, respectively.

In the following we will present our simulation results for a DC current which is ramped up to

a constant value above jc, where we have used the following form of the anisotropy term:

We assume that in the pinning center the anisotropy strength K p

u < Ku,
such that the corresponding effective anisotropy in the ultrathin ﬁlm limit induced by the dipolar

u is reduced, i.e., K p

interactions (Keﬀ = K − (µ0/2)M 2

s ) is positive (negative) for Ku (K p

u). This effectively leads to

a tilting of the magnetic texture into the plane within the pinning region. Since in a real material

there is always a small uniaxial anisotropy also in an in-plane direction, we have taken a small

rotational symmetry breaking term into account, tilting the magnetic texture along x direction.

This corresponds for example to the setup depicted schematically in Fig. 1.

In the Supplementary Material we present additional results: i) for simulations even without

dipolar interactions, in which a skyrmion and an antiskyrmion are energetically fully equivalent

wherefore the creation and decay process for skyrmions and antiskyrmions is fully symmetric; ii)

for the creation of different magnetic textures and iii) a pulse operation mode of the ”device”.

9

A. Numerics without DMI

A typical relaxed magnetization conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 2 (a). In the continous oper-

ation mode, a DC current above the critical one can generate a periodically spin textures. For

a large set of parameters these spin textures evolve into skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs. A typical

snapshot for the time evolution of the magnetization under a (continuous) DC current is presented

in Fig. 2 (b). To establish the topological nature of the skyrmion and antiskyrmion we have cal-

culated as a function of time the winding numbers over spatial regions indicated by the boxes in

cyan and magenta. The results presented in panel (c) clearly show a period creation of skyrmion/

antiskyrmion pairs with winding numbers ±1. The shedding frequency for the simulated material

structure with applied current density of 5 × 1012 A m−2 can be extracted from the power spec-

trum of the Fourier transformed data, ωshed ≈ 0.68 GHz corresponding to a shedding period of
approximately Tshed ≈ 1.47 ns [cf. panel (d)]. For this setup, we have used Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1,

u = 0 and ˜K p

information on the numerical part can be found in the Methods Section, Sec. VIII.

1.

Shedding of skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs

For currents less than the critical current, the magnetic texture around the pinning center elon-

gates until above the critical current it breaks off and a ﬁrst skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair is formed,

which travels along the magnetic ﬁlm. The details of the shedding process are shown in Fig. 4,

where we show the proﬁles of the pinning center up to 0.65 ns. The observation that the created

topological texture comes in a pair with opposite topological charge reﬂects the fact that during

the creation process the topological charge is conserved, with initial conﬁguration having no topo-

logical charge.

2. Time-evolution of a skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair

The skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair begins to move away from the pinning center and we observe

in our simulations that the distance between the anti-skyrmion and skyrmion increases at a rate

proportional to α as expected (with β = 0 in our simulations). The evolution of the pair has

an oscillatory character related to the fact that, in equilibrium, the individual structures are not

10

FIG. 4. Details of the shedding process of the time evolution of a skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair shown in

Fig. 2. Shown is the z component as a color code, and the arrows visualize the in-plane components. For

this setup, we use the same parameters as in Fig. 2: Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1, Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1,
Ku = 8 × 104 J m−3, Kp

u = 1 × 103 J m−3 inside the pinning area which has a radius of

stable. This is shown in detail in Fig. 5. The dynamical stabilization due to the current leads

to the global continuous precession of all spins around the z axis. This results in the skyrmion

(lower magnetic texture) oscillating continuously between N´eel and Bloch skyrmion type and

between negative and positive chirality, as discussed in Ref. 29, and to the anti-skyrmion (upper

magnetic texture) rotating its orientation counterclockwise. For the modelled setup we obtain

an oscillation frequency of fosc ≈ 1/0.34 ns ≈ 2.9 GHz being about four times faster than the

shedding frequency. This oscillatory behaviour does depend on the details of the speciﬁc sample

and therefore we do not explore it further, since it does not affect the production or control of the

texture in the considered time and length scale.

3. Decay of magnetic textures

In presence of a non-zero Gilbert damping, the created topological textures which are dynam-

ical solitons29,67, progressively decay (their radius shrinks) at a rate proportional to α. They will

ultimately collapse in a ﬁnite time due to imperfect topological protection on a lattice, unless

they reach an area with non zero chiral interaction at which place either the skyrmion or the anti-

skyrmion is meta-stable allowing for longer term storage.

11

FIG. 5. Detailed time evolution of a skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair in time steps of 0.05 ns. The skyrmion

(lower conﬁguration) oscillates continuously in time from a Bloch to a N´eel skyrmion and from positive

to negative chirality.29 Here all spins globally rotate counterclockwise in time. The same applies for the

antiskyrmion (upper conﬁguration), leading to a continous counterclockwise rotation of the red line (serving

as guide to the eye) at which the spins are pointing away from the center of the antiskyrmion. The oscillation

frequency is fosc ≈ 1/0.34 ns ≈ 2.9 GHz. The dashed yellow lines visualize the drift in opposite directions

in y direction due to opposite Magnus forces for skyrmion and antiskyrmion. For this setup, we used

the same parameters as in Fig. 2: Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1, Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1, Ku = 8 × 104 J m−3,
Kp

u = 1 × 103 J m−3 inside the pinning area which has a radius of 50 nm, and Gilbert damping

u = 0 and ˜Kp

of α = 0.05, and β = 0. Applied current is 5 × 1012 A m−2.

In the presented examples the skyrmion and anti-skyrmion do not decay at the same time. In

the presence of dipolar interactions, which do not break the rotational symmetry, a skyrmion is

energetically favored compared to the antiskyrmion, resulting in principle in a slightly larger life

time. However, the shedding process itself, the oscillation of the magnetic textures, as well as their

decay create a non-negligible amount of spin waves, which in turn inﬂuence the time evolution

of the magnetic textures in the system. Therefore, a complete understanding of a certain decay

process does depend on the history of the system. In our micromagnetic simulations we indeed

observe instances where either the skyrmion or the antiskyrmion decays ﬁrst as can be seen in

Fig. 6, where the top and bottom row are taken from the same simulation just at different times. In

the Supplementary Material61 we consider also a system without dipolar interactions where neither

skyrmion nor antiskyrmion are favoured and we observe that they decay at the same time.

12

FIG. 6. Snapshot of the time evolution of a skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair where in the upper panel a) (lower

panel b)) the antiskyrmion (skyrmion) decays faster than the skyrmion (antiskyrmion) due to interactions

with spin waves generated by previous skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs. Note that the top and bottom panel are

taken from the same simulation, but from different pairs created at different times. The event shown in panel

b) occurs about ∆t = 3 ns later. Furthermore, the two events are not fully symmetric and do depend on

the history of the system. For this setup, we used the same parameters as in Fig. 2: Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1,
Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1, Ku = 8 × 104 J m−3, Kp

u = 1 × 103 J m−3 inside the pinning

u = 0 and ˜Kp

area which has a radius of 50 nm, and Gilbert damping of α = 0.05, and β = 0. Applied current is

5 × 1012 A m−2.

B. Numerics with anisotropic DMI

The simulations presented above were intentionally performed without chiral interactions to

explore the creation mechanism. For the stabilization of chiral magnetic textures, however, an

inversion asymmetric interaction is needed. In the following, we consider the creation mechanism

in the presence of anisotropic N´eel DMI:65,66

For D1 = D2 = D, the twisting energy Ftwist describes the standard N´eel DMI68 favouring

more favourable, whereas for sign(D1/D2) = −1 an antiskyrmion like conﬁguration will have

a lower energy compared to a skyrmion like texture.65,66 Anti-skyrmions have been studied, but

during time evolution the skyrmion texture is preferred. Lower row: Time evolution for D1 = −D2 =

until recently they have often been considered as unstable objects.48 More recent works show that

anti-skyrmions can also occur as (meta-)stable states.65,66,69

Simulation results with anisotropic DMI are shown in Fig. 7. Here, skyrmion and anti-skyrmion

pairs are created as previously, however, the time evolution for the pairs is now inﬂuenced by the

DMI. In the upper (lower) row in Fig. 7 we considered a DMI with D1 = 5 × 10−4 J m−2 and

D2 = ±D1, which optimally favour a symmetric skyrmion (antiskyrmion).

VI. DISCUSSION

The process that we have described is an alternative way to controllably produce skyrmions and

also antiskyrmions periodically. Whereas the process itself is quite general given a set of simple

restrictions (a pinned magnetic inhomogeneity in the system caused by, for example, a local change

in the anisotropy), the speciﬁc values of the critical current are set by the material properties. For

the examples chosen the current densities are typical of the spin-transfer torque process. Although

this implies the need for large current densities, leading to possible Joule heating, this heating can

be mitigated experimentally by applying pulses, see Supplementary Material.61 Such heating does

not alter the general conclusions and just renormalizes some of the material-dependent parameters.

The incorporation of a twisting interaction like (anisotropic) DMI is not essential for the physics

of the skyrmion/antiskyrmion pair creation process described here. It affects the value of the crit-

14

ical current and the shape of textures generated. In addition it helps towards a stabilization for the

created (anti-)skyrmion texture in the static case. Hence, there is no contradiction with the Derrick-

Hobart theorem70,71 that states that there is no nontrivial localized static solution for skyrmion

without chiral interactions. In our process, which we believe is similar to the one obtained in

Ref. 53, dynamic skyrmions and antiskyrmions are being produced, and could be stabilized at a

later stage in regions with non zero (anisotropic) DMI.

In prior studies, several techniques to obtain single skyrmions have been proposed.18,25–31 How-

ever, most of them either require specialized setups or artiﬁcially tuned parameters. One recent

example is the use of an inhomogeneous current distribution in the presence of DMI.28 It is also

possible to create magnetic skyrmions by an electric current in a sample with a suitable kink sub-

ject to DM interactions due to the divergence of the magnetization in the corner.38 In particular,

here the authors observe an asymmetry in the current, meaning that they do not create skyrmions

when the current is ﬂowing in the opposite direction. Recent numerical simulation studies show

that a skyrmion can be created by the local injection of a spin-polarized current perpendicular

to the plane.29,72 In Ref. 29 the authors also produce skyrmions in a setup without DMI, however

they require a specialized setup with a nanocontact and the process is not connected to the periodic

shedding created by the interaction between the current and the locally modiﬁed anisotropy as we

propose here.

While these processes will be explored in the near future by experimental groups in search

for efﬁcient ways of controllably creating skyrmions, we propose a more general method that is

applicable to systems readily available to a wider group of experimentalist.

We believe that the creation process discussed here has already been observed in recent exper-

iment in variant setups, e.g. an injection of skyrmions is by DC current pulses.33–35 In Ref. 33 the

authors report a nucleation of skyrmions with a current pulse at the tip of a needle-like current

injecting electrode. Here, the Oersted ﬁeld near the tip may act as a dynamically deﬁned pinning

center similar to what we consider here. In Ref. 34, we speculate that the grains in the sample are

responsible for creating local inhomogeneities in the magnetization, i.e. induce pinning centers.

When a dc-current is applied, at those points skyrmion and anti-skyrmion pairs will be created.

Since in all of these works33–35 DMI is present in the considered systems, the antiskyrmions will

die quickly on timescales that are not in the experimental accessible range in the measurement

setup that have been reported so far.

To experimentally verify our prediction we suggest the following: i) One of the key aspects of

15

our mechanism is that it generates a periodic shedding of magnetic textures with a period that can

be tuned by current strength, when applying a dc-current. In the above mentioned experiments,

current pulses have been applied. When increasing the length of the current pulses towards having

effectively a dc-current, it might be possible to measure the current dependent period. ii) The other

key aspect in our theory is the magnetic inhomogeneity. By increase locally the inhomogeneities

at a certain point of the sample we predict that skyrmions can be produced in this region already

with lower current densities. Examples to do so would be to have a small area where the sample

is thinner or thicker. Alternatively, one can put a magnetic impurity into the system but the effect

of the magnetic impurity may be harder to control.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have demonstrated that it is possible to create magnetic textures by uniform

DC electric currents without the need of a magnetic ﬁeld or any standard “twisting” interactions

like Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya. We have shown that skyrmion and antiskyrmion pairs can be created

efﬁciently, controllably and periodically where the period can be tuned by the applied current

strength. We analytically derived, that in the limit of vanishing non-adiabatic torque, the period

T of production near the critical current has a dependence T ∼ (j − jc)−1/2, arising from quite

general grounds based on simple symmetry consideration of the governing dynamic equations. In

principle, within a pulse operation mode skyrmions can be produced on demand. This provides

a new avenue to study the creation of topological magnetic textures by electric means in simple

geometries. Adding DMI helps to stabilize magnetic skyrmions.

VIII. MICROMAGNETIC SIMULATIONS

Micromagnetic simulations were perfomed based on MicroMagnum63 including additional

self-written software extensions and MuMax3.64 In the simulations shown in this article we have

simulated a quasi-two-dimensional thin ﬁlm with lateral dimensions 2 µm × 1 µm × 1 nm con-

sisting of 1000 × 500 × 1 cells in x, y, and z direction, respectively, which corresponds to dis-

cretization length of 2 nm in x and y directions and 1 nm in z direction. For the plots shown in

this manuscript we have chosen material parameters similar to CoCrPt thin ﬁlms with perpendic-

ular magnetic anisotropy:54–57 Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1, Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1, and out-of-plane

16

anisotropy Ku = 2 × 104 J m−3 with anisotropy energy functional Π(M ) = 1 − M 2

z . The pinning
center is modeled as a cylinder along z direction with a radius of 50 nm and reduced anisotropy
Ku = 0 in z direction, but ˜K p
u = 1 × 103 J m−3 in x direction breaking the in-plane rotational

symmetry.

Before applying any DC currents we have ﬁrst relaxed the system to the ground state using

a large Gilbert damping parameter of α = 0.25. Subsequent simulations were performed with

α = 0.05, except when noted otherwise. In all simulations we have set the non-adiabatic spin-

torque parameter to zero, β = 0. We have checked that the results are independent of the grid

sizes.

text as well as additional numerical results.

I. ANALYTICS – SUPPLEMENTARY

To describe the current-induced magnetization dynamics of the considered ferromagnetic thin

ﬁlm we use the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the unit vector ﬁeld M generalized to include

spin-torque effects due to the electric current:

(∂t + vs∂x) ˆM = −γ ˆM × Beﬀ + α ˆM ×

(cid:18)

∂t +

β
α

(cid:19)

ˆM ,

vs∂x

(S1)

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and α and β are the dimensionless Gilbert damping and

−M −1

non-adiabatic spin-transfer-torque parameters. The effective magnetic ﬁeld is given by Beﬀ =
s (δF [ ˆM ]/δ ˆM ), where F [ ˆM ] describes the free energy of the system and Ms is the satu-
ration magnetization. The applied uniform DC current along the x direction enters the equation

via the effective spin velocity: vs = ξj with ξ = gP µB/(2eMs), where g is the g-factor, P is the

current polarization, µB is the Bohr magneton, e is the electron charge, and j is the current.

In the following we assume the absence of non-adiabatic spin-torque, i.e., β = 0, as it is

typically small. However, we checked numerically that including the non-adiabatic spin-torque

term does not change qualitatively the results. We will therefore use in the following

(∂t + ξj∂x) ˆM = γ ˆM ×

δF [ ˆM ]
δ ˆM

+ α ˆM × ∂t

ˆM .

(S2)

In the following we will ﬁrst describe the setup. Then we will show that a small dissipation

allows one to construct a functional which must be minimized by a static solution in the presence

of a current. Using this functional we demonstrate that above a certain current jc the static solution

is not stable. By ﬁnding the approximate form of the static magnetization conﬁguration for the

current just below jc, we derive the dynamics of the magnetization for the homogeneous DC

currents just above jc and prove the creation of periodic magnetic textures.

A. Pinning setup as boundary value problem

To describe the periodic texture formation analytically we assume the following general setup,

that includes the more precise setup we have proposed in the main text, shown in Fig. 1. We

22

consider a two-dimensional magnetic ﬁlm where the corresponding model, i.e., the magnetic free
energy F [ ˆM (r)] contains in particular exchange interactions and a uniaxial anisotropy along a

certain direction given by ea and does not explicitly depend on time. Furthermore there is a small

region in the magnetic ﬁlm where the direction of the uniaxial anisotropy is modiﬁed.

As in the main text, we will call this region of modiﬁed anisotropy a pinning center. The

direction along which the magnetization in the center of this region is pinned is along ep. Without

loss of generality we assume that the pinning center is located at the origin of our coordinate
system. We consider these two constraints as boundary conditions on the vector ﬁeld ˆM (r)

constituting the pinning problem:

ˆM (r → ∞, t) = ea,
ˆM (r = 0, t) = ep.

(S3a)

(S3b)

Note that the fact that we consider the pinning constraint as a boundary condition also allows to
consider the magnetic free energy functional F [ ˆM (r)] of the system to be translationally invariant

along the x direction.

As explained in the main text, when increasing the current strength, ﬁrst the magnetic texture

around the pinning center will deform and elongate until it ﬁnally rips off from the pinning center,

eventually forms a skrymion and antiskyrmion pair that then travels along the magnetic ﬁlm.

B. Energy considerations

Rewriting Eq. (S2) as

where

∂t(γF + jΩ) = −α

(cid:90)

(cid:0)∂t

ˆM (cid:1)2d2r,

(cid:90)

∂tΩ ≡ ξ

ˆM · (∂x

ˆM × ∂t

ˆM )d2r,

(S4)

(S5)

allows to interpret the change of the magnetic free energy F in time by two sources: i) dissipation

due to Gilbert damping and ii) work done by the current. The power supplied by the current −j∂tΩ

is linear in the applied current density j and describes the “effective electric ﬁeld” generated by

the magnetization dynamics.

To obtain a deeper understanding of the functional Ω it is instructive to consider the boundary
value problem for the magnetization conﬁguration ˆM (r, t) ≡ ˆM (x, y, t) at a ﬁxed y component,

23

and thereby mapping the problem for each y onto an effective one-dimensional model. According
to Eq. (S3a) ˆM (x → −∞, y, t) = ˆM (x → ∞, y, t) = ea allows to identify the one-dimensional
model as a closed line on the unit sphere with a corresponding y-dependent solid angle ωy. The
change of the solid angle ωy over time dt is given by dωy = dt (cid:82) ˆM · (∂x
ˆM )dx. By
comparing the deﬁnition of ∂tΩ in Eq. (S4) with the expression of the solid angle, we see that the

ˆM × ∂t

functional Ω can be interpreted as the sum of the solid angles over all y components:

(cid:90)

Ω = ξ

ωydy.

As the dissipative coefﬁcient α is positive, the value of the functional

S[ ˆM (r)] = γF + jΩ

(S6)

(S7)

appearing in Eq. (S4) is decreasing during the time evolution. In particular, on the static solution

the value of this functional must be at its minimum while satisfying the non-linear constraint
| ˆM (r)| = 1.

C.

Instability and critical current

Let’s consider a static solution ˆM 0(r) for some particular current strength j0. To analyse its
stability we expand around the solution and consider ˆM (r) = ˆM 0(r) + ˆm(r), where | ˆm| (cid:28) 1
and ˆM (r) still satisﬁes the (normalized) boundary value problem. This implies for the vector ﬁeld

ˆm the following boundary conditions:

ˆM 0(r) ⊥ ˆm,

ˆm(r → ∞) → 0,

ˆm(r = 0) = 0,

(S8)

where the last two conditions are the consequences of Eqs. (S3a) and (S3b). A static solution
ˆM 0(r) for some particular current strength j0 is stable, if the operator ˆΠ0 deﬁned by

ˆΠ0 ˆm(r) ≡

(cid:90)

d2r(cid:48)

δ2S0
δ ˆM (r)δ ˆM (r(cid:48))

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) ˆM = ˆM 0(r)

(S9)

is positive deﬁnite, i.e., has only strictly positive eigenvalues, for all functions satisfying the con-

ditions deﬁned by Eqs. (S8). Note that here the index “0” means that the functional S is evaluated

at the current density j0.

Additionally we know that both the Hamiltonian and Ω are translationally invariant. Thus, if a
static solution ˆM 0(r) at current strength j0 is an extremum of the functional S of Eq. (S7), then

24

a solution ˆM 0(r + aex) shifted by some distance a is also an extremum of the functional S with
the same extremal value for any distance a. Taking the limit a → 0 we ﬁnd that

(S10)

that the function ∂x

meaning that the ﬁeld ∂x

ˆM 0(r) is always a zero mode of our linear operator ˆΠ0. Note, however,
ˆM 0(r) is not in the deﬁned functional space, as for arbitrary currents it does
not satisfy the last of the conditions given by Eq. (S8). However, if there exists a current jc such
that the corresponding magnetization proﬁle ˆM c(r) fulﬁlls also the last condition

∂x

ˆM c(r = 0) = 0,

(S11)

then one of the eigenvalues of the operator ˆΠc is zero and the solution becomes unstable. Eq. (S11)
deﬁnes implicitly the value of the critical current jc above which the solution is no longer stable.

We note that our construction of the functional S, as well as the derivation of the critical current

jc, relies on the fact that at inﬁnity the magnetization is uniform. It is known, however, that at

currents larger than a certain current jc∗, such a uniform state becomes unstable.52,58,59. Thus, our

derivation makes sense only if jc < jc∗ which is the case as long as the pinning direction ep does

not coincide with the direction of the uniaxial anisotropy ea.

To further understand analytically the picture of the instability where at the critical current

density jc the magnetic textures change from static to dynamic, we consider in the following only

currents close the critical one. For such currents the magnetization is either static or changes

with time very slowly. More crucially, the statement of either static or very slow magnetization

changes allows to also neglect the Gilbert damping term in the analytic calculations, provided that

magnetization dynamics is deduced from the physical correct static magnetization proﬁle. Notably

it is this damping term that ensures that all spin wave solutions are decaying with time and then

allows to extract the physically correct static magnetization out of numerous static solutions of

Eq. (S2). In contrast this term is essential for the numerical solutions and all simulations were

performed including an Gilbert damping term.

D. Static solutions for currents just below the critical current

Within this subsection we derive the relation of how much a magnetic texture is shifted by an

electrical current strength just below the critical one.

25

As was shown above, at the critical current strength jc the operator ˆΠjc has a zero mode. For the
currents just below the critical current this zero mode acquires a small gap. So, for the currents just

below jc this mode can be taken into account explicitly. Hence, the magnetization conﬁguration at
a certain current j0 (cid:46) jc is just the conﬁguration ˆM c(r) – the static solution at the critical current
– shifted by some small distance x0 along the direction of the current plus a small correction:
ˆM 0(r) ≡ ˆM c(r − x0ex) + δ ˆM . Note that the distance x0 is characteristic for the applied
current strength j0. The condition of satisfying the two boundary conditions ˆM 0(0) = ˆM c(0),
i.e., δ ˆM (0) = 0, and ˆM

2
0(r) = 1 up to order x2

0 leads to:

ˆM 0(r) = ˆM c(r − x0ex) −

Thus, for each small x0 we have a speciﬁc current density j0 for which the above function is

boundary value problem and thus minimizes the functional S given by Eq. (S7), which for above

ansatz yields

S0[ ˆM 0(r)] = Sc[ ˆM 0(r)] + (j0 − jc)Ω[ ˆM 0]

The ﬁrst term on the RHS is independent of the distance x0. The third and the fourth term van-

26

As Sc[ ˆM c(r)], Ωc[ ˆM c(r)], and Ac are independent of the distance x0, minimizing Eq. (S13) with
respect to x0 while satisfying the condition that for x0 = 0 the critical current jc and j0 coincide,

then yields:

jc − j0 = x2

0Ac.

(S15)

This equation establishes the relation between the shift of the critical solution x0 and the current

j0. Note that the difference jc − j0 is indeed second order in x0.

E. Periodic texture production for currents just above the critical current

For currents just larger than the critical current jc, deﬁned by exhibiting a zero mode of the
operator ˆΠc, the static solutions are unstable. At currents j just above jc this zero mode becomes

dynamic. Therefore, to obtain information about the dynamics of the magnetization conﬁguration,

we make the following ansatz for the applied current j:

ˆM (r, t) = ˆM 0(r, t) + ˆm(r, t),

(S16)

where ˆM 0(r, t) is the static magnetization conﬁguration for the current j0, given by Eq. (S15)
with time-dependent x0. The dynamics of the zero mode means that we consider x0 to be time-

dependent. j0(t) satisﬁes Eq. (S15) at each moment of time. Furthermore, ˆm(r, t) is a small

perturbation obeying the following conditions:

ˆM 0(r, t) ⊥ ˆm(r, t),

ˆm(r → ∞, t) → 0,

ˆm(r = 0, t) = 0.

(S17)

The above ansatz we insert into the LLG equation Eq. (S2). Linearizing Eq. (S2) in m(r, t) we

obtain for α = 0:

In the last equation we have used Eq. (S12b) and the fact that ∂tx0 and the current difference is of
the order of ∂tx0 ∼ (j − j0) ∼ x2

0. Equation (S19) is an inhomogeneous linear equation for the

vector ﬁeld ˆm(r, t) which must satisfy all the conditions in Eq. (S17). For

∂tx0 = j − j0

(S20)

Eq. (S19) has a simple trivial solution, ˆm ≡ 0, satisfying all conditions given by Eqs. (S17).

Equation (S20) together with Eq. (S15) gives the dynamics of the soft mode of the magnetization

conﬁguration for the currents just above jc. To ﬁnd the period of the texture production we need to
solve Eqs. (S20) and (S15): ∂tx0 = j − jc + Acx2
j−jc+Acx2 . The major contribution to
the integral comes from Acx2 < j − jc, and the integral converges fast for larger x. In the texture

This is the period of production of the textures in magnetization conﬁguration.

II. NUMERICS – SUPPLEMENTARY

In the following we provide more simulation results. In particular we consider the theoretical

case without any “twisting” interaction, i.e., also without dipolar interactions. Then we provide

examples where different magnetic textures are shedded. At the end we show that in principle one

can use this set-up to generate skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs in a pulse-operation mode. Finally,

we provide an overview of parameters used in our simulations in Table S1 including parameters

of Refs. 24,32 for reference.

A. Without dipole-dipole interactions

As can be deduced from analytics no ”twisting” interaction is needed for the shedding process

itself, i.e., also in theoretical version without dipolar interactions a shedding process still occurs.

This we have also conﬁrmed numerically, see Fig. S1. Note that in the absence of any twisting

interactions including dipolar ﬁelds the skyrmion and the antiskyrmion conﬁguration are energet-

ically degenerate and therefore they also decay at the same time.

28

FIG. S1. Shedding of skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs without dipolar interactions. For this setup, we used an

effective uniaxial anisotropy z direction to incorporate the effects of the dipolar ﬁeld: Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1,
Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1, Ku = 2.345 × 104 J m−3, Kp

u = −5.655 × 104 J m−3 and ˜Kp

u = 1 × 103 J m−3

inside the pinning area which has a radius of 50 nm, and Gilbert damping of α = 0.05, and β = 0. Applied

current density is 5 × 1012 A m−2.

29

FIG. S2. Simluation results for the creation process in the presence of larger (anisotropic) DMI. The arrows

visualize the in-plane component of the magnetization. The yellow circle indicates the defect region with

modiﬁed anisotropy. The top (bottom) panel shows the results for D1 = ±D2 = 1 × 10−3 J m−2. The left

column shows the starting conﬁguration for the z-component around the pinning center whereas the right

column shows the time evolution corresponding to the DC current density j = 3 × 1012 A m−2. The other

parameters used for this setup are: Ms = 3 × 105 A m−1, Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1, Ku = 8 × 104 J m−3,
Kp

u = 1 × 103 J m−3 inside the pinning area which has a radius of 50 nm, and Gilbert damping

u = 0 and ˜Kp

of α = 0.05, and β = 0.

B. Shedding of different magnetic textures

Depending on the material parameters, the current strength and the size of the pinning center

also different magnetic textures can be shedded. Here we show two examples of different shedded

magnetic textures. Compared to the main text we have chosen i) a system with a larger DMI,

see Fig. S2, where the center of the shedded magnetic textures is not along the direction of the

current but determined by the interplay of current and DMI, and ii) a setup with a larger saturation

magnetization, see Fig. S3. Here we observe, aside from the skyrmion/antiskyrmion pairs, also

the shedding of other magnetic textures that look like “walls” from which then on the edges also

skyrmion and antiskyrmions rip off.

30

FIG. S3. Shown here are more complicated shedded magnetic textures. The parameters used for this simula-

tion are: Ms = 6.5 × 105 A m−1, Aex = 2 × 10−11 J m−1, Ku = 2.88 × 105 J m−3, Kp
and ˜Kp

u = 1 × 103 J m−3 inside the pinning area which has a radius of 50 nm, and Gilbert damping of

u = 1 × 105 J m−3

α = 0.25, and β = 0. Applied current density is 7 × 1012 A m−2.

C. Pulse-operation mode

Executing the device in a pulse operation mode, in principle allows to create a desired number

of skyrmions with any speciﬁc spacing pattern. A simulation result for the pulse operation in time

is shown in Fig. S4. In this simulation we have created a pinning center by adding a local magnetic

ﬁeld instead of modifying the anisotropy strength and we have used the current pulse sequence

shown in the left part of Fig. S4. Switching on the DC current, the magnetic texture around the

pinning center ﬁrst elongates until it breaks off and then starts shedding skyrmion/antiskyrmion

pairs until the shedding rate quickly reaches its nominal rate. A similar transient state occurs when

lowering the DC current below jc where the pinning center keeps shedding skyrmion/antiskyrmion

pairs until it has lost enough “momentum” and shedding stops. The duration of the transient states

depends on the details of the system. An important aspect of this mode is the lower power that it

requires. The creation process requires a substantially higher current density than the one to move

the magnetic textures. Hence, by shortening the pulses that create the skyrmion-anti-skyrmion

pairs and using a much lower current density to move them, one can minimize Joule heating.

31

FIG. S4. Skyrmion creation by DC pulse operation mode. A desired number of skyrmions can be created

by controlling the strength of the applied DC current. As shown in the last pulse, also a single skyrmion-

anti-skyrmion pair can be created. To show the clean mechanism of the pulse-operation mode, in these

simulations we have chosen a setup that reduces the effect spin waves. The particular parameters that we

have chosen are: Ms = 1.33 × 105 A m−1, Aex = 1.3 × 10−11 J m−1, Ku = 2 × 104 J m−3, and Kp

u = 0

inside the pinning area which has a radius of 25 nm, and Gilbert damping of α = 0.01, and β = 0. Pinning

of the magnetization in x direction is achieved via a local magnetic ﬁeld of H = 5 × 104 A m−1. Applied

current density is switched between 6.25 × 1012 A m−2 and 6.75 × 1012 A m−2.

TABLE S1. Overview over simulation parameters used in the main text and supplementary material. The

parameters used for the ﬁgures in the main text as well as Figs. S1 and S2 are motivated by Refs. 54–57.

In all simulations we have set β = 0. † In Fig. S1 we have incorporated the effect of the dipolar ﬁeld into

renormalized effective uniaxial anisotropies along the z direction. ‡ In Fig. S4 we have used a local magnetic

ﬁeld of 50 kA m−1 instead of an in-plane symmetry-breaking anisotropy ﬁeld to tilt the magnetization into

the x direction inside the pinning area. Here the parameters are similar to Ref. 52.
