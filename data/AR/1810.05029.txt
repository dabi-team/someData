Abstract 

The effect of temperature in high purity Ar (low oxygen partial pressure) on the oxidation and 

crystal phase evolution of c-Al0.66Ti0.33N arc-PVD coatings was investigated. High temperature 

tribology in Ar jet and adhesion behavior of the oxidized coating were addressed. The use of Ar 

protects the coating from the oxidation reactions and allowed to shed light into the details and 

paths of the nitride oxidation process. The c-Al0.66Ti0.33N nitrides were slightly oxidized in Ar even 

at high temperature (700 to 900 °C). The surface chemistry evaluation shows very thin Al- and 

Ti-based oxide layers formation after treatment at 700 °C in Ar. However, the onset formation of 

the rutile TiO2 oxide was detected only after treatment at 900 °C and was clearly found by low-

angle XRD diffraction after 1000 °C. The XPS surface analysis of the oxidized samples at 800°C 

indicated the formation of extremely thin layers mainly composed of mixed oxides (α-Al2O3 γ-

Al2O3 and rutile TiO2). The gradual changes in the chemical composition of the oxidized coatings 

observed at 900 °C clearly demonstrate the formation of gradient boundaries between Al-rich and 

Ti-rich oxy-nitride layers. After exposure at 1000 °C at least four oxides and oxi-nitrides layers 

and interlayers were found. Additionally, it is suspected that the transition oxide phases such as c-

TiO, c-Al0.54Ti2.46O0.28N4.58, α-Al2TiO5 and TiOxNy might be precursors leading to the formation

of thermodynamically stable rutile and alumina phases. Surface inspection after high temperature 

tribology in Ar jet showed formation of tensile cracks in the wear tracks and wear processes due 

to high size particle adhesion-abrasion and low size particle micro-plowing of hard nitrides, oxi-

nitrides and brittle oxide particles. Adhesion tests performed after high temperature tribology in 

Ar showed critical load decrease related to cohesive and adhesive damages at the contact point of 

the scratch track. 

Key words: arc PVD, nitride coating, Ar-treatment, oxidation, tribo-protection. 

1.  Introduction 

The mechanical strength and oxidation resistance of c-Ti(1-x)AlxN coatings relies upon its 

chemistry and microstructure. In c-Ti(1-x)AlxN nitrides, the Al-content can vary between 0.25 and 

~ 0.92 [1]. However, only nitrides with a maximum Al content of x = 0.6 can be assumed to be 

stable in a cubic structure. Slightly higher Al-content (> 0.7) can lead to the formation of h-AlN, 

negatively impacting the coating hardness [2]. Hardness improvement can be induced either by 

spinodal decomposition or grain refinement. Spinodal decomposition depends on nitride splitting 

into its single cubic nitrides [3-6]. This decomposition process is strongly conditional on the 

coating composition and the temperature of exposure [7, 8], e.g. c-Ti0.36Al0.64N starts to 

decompose at 850 °C [9]. On the other hand, grain refinement produced by Al-concentrations up 

to 0.6 has a favorable effect on hardness [9]. This improvement is mainly caused by the Hall-

Petch effect [11-13]. Other studies explain hardness decrease (or increase) as a combination of 

microstructural characteristics such as grain size effect, texture and residual stresses related to the 

coating deposition parameters [14]. 

Oxidation resistance of the ternary nitride is increased by Al-addition into the TiN [15]; either 

small amounts of Al (Ti0.6Al0.3N) or high Al-contents (Ti0.4Al0.6N) have a positive impact on the 

2 

 
 
oxidation resistance [16]. The improved oxidation performance is due to the formation of a 

protective layer (e.g. Al2O3) upon exposure to temperature and oxygen. Following the reaction, a 

dense and homogenous oxide layer forms with time, if enough Al supply is available, further 

retarding ion diffusion and diminishing coating degradation. As a consequence of hardness 

improvement and better oxidation resistance, huge impacts on the performance of coated parts, 

components and tooling has been accomplished. For instance, TiAlN coated drills achieved 269 

% more holes compared to the work reached with TiN coated tools [15]. Similar performance 

achievements have been reported elsewhere for machining processes such as turning [17] and 

milling [18]. 

Thermal treatments under controlled low oxygen partial pressures (e.g., vacuum conditions), 

temperature and time have been applied as an annealing step to investigate the age-hardening 

processes that might take place during coating service [9, 10]. Thermal treatments inducing 

hardness enhancement start at 500 °C [10], but significant hardness improvement is only reached 

after exposure to temperatures between 700 and 1000 °C [9, 10, 19, 20]. Treatments at 

temperatures higher than 1000 °C cause a decrease in hardness, which has been associated with 

the formation and growth of incoherent w-AlN [9, 10]. Particularly, nitrides with high Al 

contents (Ti0.33Al0.66N) displayed peak hardness condition after thermal treatments at 900 °C in 

comparison with nitrides containing less Al [20]. Johansson et al [20] also described the age-

hardening effects on Ti(1-x)AlxN system (for x = 0.31, 0.47, 0.67) caused by the harsh temperature 

and pressure conditions during a turning operation. In practice, conventional coated metal tools 

with Al-containing nitrides are exposed to ambient air and elevated temperatures thus providing 

the best conditions for oxidation reactions. Degradation studies of c-Ti(1-x)AlxN coatings in such 

highly oxidizing environments have been carried out in the past; for instance, arc-PVD 

Ti0.5Al0.5N coating has been severely oxidized after exposure to 850 °C/10h [21]. Pfeiler et al 

3 

 
reported full oxidation of Ti0.33Al0.67N after annealing at 900 °C/5h in air [22]. As an alternative 

to protect c-Ti(1-x)AlxN coatings from oxidation and degradation, machining operations could be 

carried out in the presence of inert gases such as N2, CO2, Ar or any mixture of these. The term 

gas-cooled machining has been coined for environmental friendly machining where a gas 

lubricant is used for machining instead of solid or liquid lubricant [23]. In addition to the positive 

environmental impact, gas cooled machining was proposed in the 30s for improving 

machinability and lubricity at the tool-workpiece-chip interface. Recently, different attempts to 

improve high speed dry machinability of titanium alloys using uncoated carbides in Ar-rich 

environments have been carried out in order to avoid the chemical reactions at the tool - chip and 

tool – workpiece [24]. It has been reported that Ar promoted wear at the cutting edge negatively 

impacting the performance of the tool and decreasing operative tool life, which was mainly due 

to poor heat transfer. In other cases, the use of argon has been successfully applied as lubri-

cooling protection of ceramic tools for dry machining of Inconel 715 [25]. To our knowledge 

,inert atmospheres have not been proposed as medium to protect c-TixAl1-xN based coatings from 

oxidation. From this perspective, it would be relevant to evaluate the degree of oxidation under 

such working conditions. For these reasons, this research was focused on investigating the crystal 

phase evolution during oxidation treatments of the arc-PVD c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings treated in 

high purity Ar at temperatures up to 1000 °C. Additionally, wear behavior and crystal phase 

transformation upon temperature of c-Al0.66Ti0.33N under argon jet was studied. 

2.  Experimental 

2.1 Coating deposition 

4 

 
 
c-Al0.66Ti0.33N hard coatings were deposited on 10 x 20 x 1 mm-alumina substrates and 1 in-

mirror polished AISI M2 steel using an arc-PVD coater from Oerlikon model Domino Mini. 

Alloy targets (100 mm Ø) of Al/Ti:0.66/0.33 at. % and 99.5 % purity from Plansee were used. 

The alumina substrates were ultrasonically cleaned, dried and mounted in a three-fold rotation 

system. Firstly, the substrates were coated with a ~ 1µm thick Ti layer, hereafter called Ti-

interlayer, to improve the adhesion of the nitride. Then, the Ti-metalized substrates were heated 

up to about 330 °C using a 9 KW heating system in the vacuum chamber. Substrates temperature 

was measured by thermocouples located near the planetary. Before the coating step, the 

substrates surface were cleaned via erosion with Ar+ ions using the AEGD (Arc Enhanced Glow 

Discharge) – Etching process. The deposition time was maintained for about 1 h applying 80 V 

bias. Upon coating, the working temperature reached ~ 430 °C. 

2.2 Isothermal treatment in Ar 

The isothermal treatments at 700, 800, 900 and 1000 °C were carried out in a thermogravimetric 

analyzer (TGA) system using high purity argon (99.997 %). The isothermal TGA experiments 

were conducted in a Setsys equipment from Setaram. The furnace chamber of the TGA was 

evacuated for 20 min and then filled with 200 ml/min of Ar. Subsequently, the Ar flow was 

changed to 20 ml/min for 10 min and, finally, heated at a ramp of 50 °C/min in Ar up to the 

selected treatment temperature. The TGA data was separately collected during the heating ramp 

and at each isothermal temperature for 5h. The obtained TGA results were normalized to the 

calculated geometric surface area of the coated Al2O3 samples (approx. 4.53 cm2). 

2.3 Coating analysis 

Roughness of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N-Al2O3 and c-Al0.66Ti0.33N-AISI M2 steel systems was measured 

by means of contact profilometry using a DektaktXT equipment from Bruker. Roughness 

5 

 
measurements were carried out using a Stylus tip with 12.5 µm radius over 2 mm distance and 

repeating the process 5 times. The crystal phase measurements prior and subsequent to the 

oxidation treatments were carried out in a SmartLab XRD diffractometer from Rigaku in PB/PSA 

mode Parallel Beam/Parallel Slit Analyzer with a grazing incidence angle (ω = 0.2°) 2θ geometry 

and Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 44 Amp) at a step size of 0.02°. The diffraction patterns were 

indexed using the Integrated X-ray powder diffraction Software PDXL from Rigaku. 

The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the as-coated and oxidized samples was 

assessed in an instrument from Physical Electronics model PHI 5000 VersaProbe II using 

monochromatic Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The spot size, the power and the X-Ray voltage 

were 100 µm, 25 W and 15 V, respectively. The depth profiling of the oxidized films was 

performed using 2 kV Ar+ ions over a 3x3 mm sputtering area and 1min erosion time. The 

surface erosion was ~ 6.25 nm/min leading to ~ 500 nm coating depth analysis. Binding energy 

values were corrected with reference to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. The Ti spectra were fitted with 

Ti2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 branches spin-orbit splitting of 5.55 eV. The peak fitting analysis was 

performed using the software AAnalyzer®. 

The initial state of the coating and the sample treated at 1000 °C were analyzed in a TEM JEM 

2200 FS+CS from JEOL applying 200 kV and an EDX Inca analyzer from Oxford. For this 

purpose, FIB-cuts of the cross-sections were previously prepared. A thin Au thin layer was 

deposited on top of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coating and then the FIB-cut was carried out using Ga+ 

ions. 

2.4 Tribological study 

Pin-on-disk wear experiments were carried out applying an argon jet (99.997 % purity) at RT, 

700, 800, & 900 °C. A commercial High Temperature Tribometer from Anton Paar, model THT 

6 

 
1000 with adapted Ar jet to the Instrument to protect the coating surface during tribology was 

used. Prior to these experiments arc-PVD c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings were deposited, following the 

deposition process mentioned in section 2.1, on mirror polished AISI M2 steel without any 

interlayer. Alumina balls of 6-mm diameter were used and a normal load of 5 N was applied at a 

linear speed of 7.37 cm/s resulting in a 3.5-mm wear track radius. Samples were heated at the 

selected temperature in Ar prior to the pin-on-disk test. Friction coefficient against distance and 

cycle number were recorded. Argon jet was applied during heating, the pin-on-disk experiments, 

and cooling after 10,000-cycles test. Arc PVD coating-AISI M2 systems were analyzed after 

tribological studies via grazing incidence XRD and optical imaging. Additionally, the 

Al0.66Ti0.33N coating samples were scratch tested after Ar-tribology in a Revetest equipment 

model RST3 from Anton Paar. Scratch tests were carried out using a Rockwell C (200 µm) 

indenter applying 1 – 35 N in 3.5 mm at 7 mm/min load gradient. 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1 Initial state of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings 

A representative cross-sectional view of the as-coated arc-PVD c-Al0.66Ti0.33N nitrides on the 

Al2O3 substrates is displayed in Fig. 1. The average thickness of the nitride layer on Al2O3 was ~ 

1.2 μm and the surface roughness of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N-Al2O3 system was Ra = 1.84 μm ± 0.46. 

These surface characteristics are due to the intrinsic roughness of the polycrystalline alumina 

plate (Ra= 1.445 μm ±0.274) . The coating thicknesses were reached in a three-fold rotation 

configuration of the planetary system at 3 rpm. The Al/Ti average atomic ratio of the as-coated 

sample was about 2/1 matching the employed target composition (66/33). The coating surface 

showed no evidence of either micro-cracks or local delamination. XRD patterns of the as-coated 

c-Al0.66Ti0.33N on the Al2O3 plates displayed the diffraction peaks of the metastable cubic nitride 

phase. The peak reflexion at 63.3° 2θ corresponds to the (220) orientation of the cubic nitride 

7 

 
phase. This peak and others close to this 2θ angle are commonly reported in the literature for 

similar coating compositions c-Ti1-xAlxN [21]. In our case, the XRD reflexion at 37.5° of the 

(111) plane of the coating is very close to the (110) plane of the substrate and the 43.45° 2θ 

corresponding to the (200) plane overlaps with the (113) plane of the alumina substrate 

(corundum JCPDS # 46-1212). The peak at 40° is related to the Ti-interlayer oriented in the (101) 

direction (Titanium JCPDS # 05-0682). No other crystalline phases such as c-TiN, c-AlN or h-

AlN were detected for as-coating conditions. 

XPS spectra of the as-coated c-Al0.66Ti0.33N system confirmed the presence of an Al-Ti-N bonds, 

see Fig. 2. The Al 2p displays two unresolved peaks (Fig. 2a), the first peak found at 73.9 eV and 

the second at 75.2 eV indicating the existence of the Al-Ti-N bonds [22, 26] and Al-Ti-O-N 

bonds [26], respectively. No Al-N bonds in the range between 74.3 and 74.7 eV [27] were 

observed. Moreover, the Ti 2p reveals mainly three species (Fig. 2b): the first doublet at 455.56 

eV and 461.36 eV correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 branchings, respectively. This is in 

agreement with the binding energy of Ti in the TiAlN structure [22, 28], and no other signals of 

Ti-N bonds were found. The second doublet at 457.27 and 462.93 eV confirms the presence of 

TiOxNy bonds [28] and, the third doublet at 459.20 and 464.86 eV is associated with Ti-O bonds 

into TiO2 [29]. All the chemical information provided by the XPS spectra is in agreement with 

the crystal phases found by XRD. Fig. 2c displays the N 1s spectrum with three components at 

396.59, 397.68 and 400.36 eV corresponding to Al-Ti-N, Al-Ti-O-N and N-C bonds [22, 26-28]. 

The last component at 400.36 eV has been related to either N-adsorbates [22, 26] or organic 

bonds N-C [26]. Furthermore, the O 1s shows two unresolved peaks at 531.19 and 532.99 eV 

indicating the presence of the O-Ti and Al-O bonds, respectively [22-27, 30]. The presence of 

oxygen-containing species has been associated with at least two contributions: residual oxygen in 

8 

 
the chamber (e.g. gases impurities, humidity, and adsorbed oxygen) that may react with the 

growing nitride [31] and the atmospheric oxygen present after deposition and cooling [32]. 

3.2 Thermal treatments of c-Al0.66Ti0.33N in pure Ar. 

Only a few TGA studies of c-Ti1-xAlxN coatings have been reported analyzing their behavior 

under inert atmospheres and/or low-oxygen partial pressures. For instance, Martin Moser et al 

[33] and Rizzo et al [22] investigated the spinodal decomposition of c-AlTiN coatings using DSC 

and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) in inert atmospheres (i.e. 99.9 % helium and 99.999 % 

argon respectively) at a heating rate of 20 °C/min and no dwelling time. In those investigations, 

the AlTiN oxidation behavior was not the central point of the research and no data was reported 

in this regard. In our study, the arc-PVD c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings were isothermally oxidized in 

99.997 % pure Ar at 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C during 5 h. At the selected heating rate of 50 

°C/min, the set point temperature was reached within ~13 to 16 min. The normalized mass-gain 

curves after oxidation are compared in Fig. 3. A very similar parabolic mass-gain was observed 

upon treatments at 700 and 800 °C up to ~ 60 min (Fig. 3a). The linear trends observed after 

plotting mass gain vs. time0.5 in Fig. 3b confirm their diffusion-controlled oxidation behavior 

(following a parabolic model) with a higher slope observed at 800 °C in comparison with 700 °C 

(kp700 = 2.64333X10-6 mg2/min.cm4) as a result of its faster oxidation rate (kp800 = 4.34893X10-6 

mg2/min.cm4). In this stage, the inward diffusion of oxygen and outward transport of the Al and 

Ti species controls the oxidation process. The linear behavior observed at 700 and 800 °C suggest 

that the thermal growth oxide is mainly controlled by single phase oxide growth [33]. 

Furthermore, purely parabolic behavior with a  kp900 = 6.57865X10-6 mg2/min.cm4) was recorded 

for the sample treated at 900 °C for times below 100 min, followed by a slight mass-gain 

decrease (Fig. 3b). The wavy nature of the TGA curve could be attributed to three main causes: 

the formation of gaseous nitrogen species being released, micro-spallation of tiny fractions of the 

9 

 
porous oxide layer and signal-noise ratio from the TGA. On the other hand, the isothermal 

treatment at 1000 °C exhibited two linear oxidation kinetics (Fig. 3a), which indicates the non-

protective nature of the oxide layer formed on the c-Ti1-xAlxN coatings. The first region, below 

30 min, with a faster mass gain and kl,t<30min = 2.18774x10-5 mg2/min.cm4 was followed by a mass 

gain decrease again indicating the non-protective nature of the oxide scale with kl,t>30min = 

6.34517x10-5 mg2/min.cm4. This oxidation behavior has been related to the absence of oxygen 

gradient in the coating [34]. In a similar way, the wavy behavior at 900 and 1000 °C could be 

also partially related to coating stress and micro-cracking followed by further oxidation reactions 

at the open surface cracks. 

The spinodal decomposition of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N is an additional phenomena that might affect 

the oxidation behavior (and mass gain) of the coating system at 800 °C and higher temperatures. 

The spinodal decomposition onset at ~ 800 °C depends on the coating composition [34]. Nitrides 

with high Al-content such as c-Al0.66Ti0.33N start to decompose into the cubic single nitrides at 

about 817 °C [19]. Consequent oxidation reactions of the single nitrides, c-TiN and c-AlN (at 

some point also h-AlN) of c-Al0.66Ti0.33N might be relevant above 900 °C considering the well-

known susceptibility to oxidation of these binary nitrides.  

In our study, the spinodal decomposition of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coating was not detected by the 

applied characterization techniques. However, the formation of the binary cubic nitrides and its 

effect on the oxidation cannot be fully ruled out and further investigations are needed to address 

these questions. 

3.3 Phase evolution of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N after Ar treatments. 

The  evolution  of  the  crystalline  phases  by  XRD  upon  thermal  treatment  of  the  c-Al0.66Ti0.33N 

coating in pure Ar is shown in Fig. 4. The peak reflection at 63.54° corresponds to the (220) plane 

10 

 
of  the  cubic  ternary  nitride  (JCPDS  #  00-080-4072),  indicating  that  the  c-Al0.66Ti0.33N  phase  is 

detected until 900 °C/5h in Ar whereas at 1000 °C/5h in Ar the peak shows a clear attenuation 

suggesting the nitride degradation, e.g., spinodal decomposition and nitride oxidation. In the XRD 

data the peaks associated to α-Al2O3 (JCPDS # 01-730-5928) are mixed contributions coming from 

the substrate and the thermally grown oxide upon treatment. Initially, a decrease in the α-Al2O3 

peaks are observed at 700°C followed by a continuous increase after 800°C. At 700 °C the cubic 

c-Al0.66Ti0.33N phase is still present and the 2θ peak = 34.6 ° appears and might be related to the 

cubic α-Al2TiO5 phase formation (JCPDS # 00-018-0068). This peak phase is better resolved after 

treatment  at  800  °C  suggesting  further  phase  increase.  Additionally,  2θ  at  ~  37°  may  indicate 

oxidation processes contributing to evolve into c-Al0.54Ti2.46O0.28N4.58 crystals (JCPDS # 00-042-

1279), which seems  to  develop  up to  900 °C and then decreased at  higher temperatures almost 

disappearing after the treatment at 1000 °C. At this temperature the peak at 2θ at 36.8° also points 

out to c-TiO phase. At 900 °C the coating exhibits the onset formation of rutile r-TiO2 displaying 

the 2θ = 27.54°, 36.1°, and 54.26° diffraction peaks corresponding to the (110), (101) and (221) 

planes,  respectively  (JCPDS  #  00-001-1292).  The  diffraction  peaks  related  to  the  rutile  r-TiO2 

phase are clearly identified after oxidation at  1000 °C/5h  in  Ar. These facts  indicate that oxide 

phases such as AlTiO-N, α-Al2TiO5 and c-TiO could be related to the intermediate species that lead 

to  the  formation  of  thermodynamically  stable  rutile  and  aluminum  oxides.  In  the  literature,  α-

Al2TiO5 and c-TiO oxides were found after annealing of similar nitrides at 900 °C/5h [35, 36] and 

1000  °C  [37].  In  summary,  the  XRD  data  display  clear  evidence  of  the  Ti-based  oxides  being 

formed at 1000 °C. However, these data do not conclusively explain the oxide evolution at 900 °C 

and  lower  temperatures.  The  XPS  data  reported  in  next  section  provide  better  insight  into  the 

oxidation processes at those temperatures. 

XPS evaluation after the treatments in Ar 

11 

 
The  chemical  composition  of  the  thermally  treated  (oxidized)  samples  was  analyzed  by  XPS. 

Surface XPS data for Al 2p, Ti 2p, N 1s and O 1s was acquired on the sample thermally treated at 

700 °C, while depth profiling data up to ~ 500 nm was recorded for samples treated at 800 °C and 

900  °C.  The  XPS  analysis  of  the  sample  thermally  treated  at  700  °C/5h  in  Ar  presented  slight 

oxidation of c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coating. Well-defined O 1s signals and no BE peaks due to N 1s or Ti 

2p were found showing the N-depletion and the formation of only aluminum oxide on the coating 

surface. This is in agreement with the observations made by McIntyre et al [38] and the theory of 

mass loss caused by N-release. 

XPS depth profiling 

The XPS depth profiles were acquired for the samples treated at 800 and 900 °C. At these 

temperatures no clear indication of coating oxidation was detected by the low-angle XRD 

analysis. Figures 5 to 8 present the XPS depth profiling analysis for the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings 

after TGA. BE of Al 2p recorded at 800 and 900 °C display the thermally grown oxide evolution 

along the coating thickness in Fig. 5. Al 2p signals at ~ 74.4 eV below ~ 92.5 nm were associated 

with Al2O3 according to Rotole and Sherwood [39]. Above ~ 246.8 nm of depth, and additional 

small peak was identified for both temperatures at higher energies, ~ 74.84 eV. This peak was 

indexed as α-Al2O3 according to the theoretical work reported by Lizarraga et al [40], where XPS 

spectra were calculated for amorphous alumina and its polymorphic phases based on first-

principles calculations. In this study, a theoretical BE shift of 0.54 eV was reported from the 

single α-Al2O3 peak corresponding to the six fold aluminum coordination number Al(VI) to the 

central fourfold aluminum coordination number Al(IV) of the Al2O3 peak. This ΔeV is in good 

agreement with the experimental shift observed in our measurements; nevertheless, variations can 

be expected either by the deviations for the stoichiometry and the XPS experimental setup. For 

12 

 
instance, the Al2O3 phase can admit nitrogen in solution and still maintain its cubic structure, 

e.g., Al2.85O3.45N0.55 JCPDS # 01-080-2171. This phase could not be confirmed by XRD in Fig. 4 

due to the overlap of its main peaks (311) and (440) with the Al2O3 phase signal coming from 

the substrate and the new Al2O3 formation from the coating as a result of the thermal 

treatments. The confirmation of Al2O3 formation by XPS, in combination with the parabolic 

oxidation behavior observed for the samples treated at 800, kp800°C

= 4.349 x 10-6 mg2/cm4 min 

below 5h, and 900 °C, kp900°C

= 6.578 x 10-6 mg2/cm4min below 100 min, suggest that the 

thermally grown oxide kinetics are mainly controlled by the growth of Al2O3 in the parabolic 

region. This, in turn, is supported by the parabolic rate constants values reported by Brumm and 

Grabke in [41] for Al2O3 growth, kp800°C

~ 1.4 x 10-6 mg2/cm4min and 

kp900°C

~ 6 x 10-6 mg2/cm4min . At the same time, an increase in the peak signal of Al-Ti-O-N 

compounds is observed as a function of the depth profile, which was associated with the c-

Al0.66Ti0.33N coating. An oxygen enrichment of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N is expected upon thermal 

treatments and even the formation of transient oxy-nitrides compounds. 

Similarly, O 1s peaks were also in good agreement with the expected BE of ~ 531.8 eV for 

Al2O3 [39] after treatments at 800 and 900°C, as shown in Fig. 6. In our study, the O 1s peaks 

displayed slight chemical shifts at the coating depth that might be associated to oxygen bonded to 

Al-Ti-N-containing species which agrees with the XRD results showed in Fig. 4 where the Al0.54 

Ti2.46 N0.28 O4.58 phase (JCPDS # 00-042-1279) was indexed at 800 and 900°C.  

Ti 2p peaks at ~ 61 and 92 nm were extremely weak and could not be resolved at 800 °C. This 

result suggests that Ti-containing species below 92.5 nm of depth are in the range of the XPS 

detection limit, i.e., from 0.1 to 1 at. %, and therefore, that a protective Al2O3 scale is still present 

after 5 h thermal treatment. This assumption was confirmed with the analysis of Fig 9.  Fig. 7a 

13 

 
shows oxidized regions located between 246 and 500 nm contain Ti-species associated to Ti-O 

(463.95 and 458.35 eV), Ti-Al-O-N (462.54 and 456.75 eV) and Ti-Al-N (460.75 and 455.14 eV) 

bonds. On the other hand, Fig. 7b displays the Ti 2p spectra of the Ti-species formed upon 5 h 

oxidation treatment at 900 °C. BE at 455 eV in the first 61.5 nm is due to the presence of Al-Ti-N 

bonds. A doublet at 462.88 and 457.28 eV associated with Ti-Al-O-N species was also observed 

with a slightly shift to higher binding energies suggesting a chemical change relative to Ti-

species at deeper regions. At ~ 92.5 nm the signals of the Ti-Al-O-N bonds were 462.2 and 456.6 

eV and remain constant at coating depths up to 500 nm. BEs at 462.2 and 456.6 eV have been 

associated to sub-stoichiometric TiOx oxides [26] or to TiOxNy bonds [25, 28]. A similar trend of 

the BEs was revealed for Ti 2p corresponding to Ti-O species.  BEs of Ti-O were ~ 459 and 

464.68 eV near the surface of the oxide scale (~ 61.7 nm), and slight shift to higher BEs was 

detected. At ~ 92.5 nm, the doublet of Ti-O bonds was found at 458 and 463.6 eV, which remain 

unchanged at the coating depth up to 500 nm. This analysis evidences that a non-continuous but 

homogenous alumina scale is obtained after 5 h oxidation at 900 °C. On the contrary, various 

oxides and oxy-nitrides such as Ti-rich oxides (TiO2, TiAlOx , Ti-Al-O-N) and Al-rich oxides 

(Al2O3, AlTiOx, AlTiON) may co-exist up to 500 nm after treatment at 900 °C. According to the 

XPS spectra of Al- and Ti-containing species, gradual transitions among oxides inside the scale 

may be expected. 

N 1s peaks after depth profiling of the oxidized coatings treated at 800° and 900 °C are shown in 

Fig. 8. Similarly to the Ti 2p signals, N 1s peaks were not observed at ~ 62.7 and 92.5 nm of 

depth after treatment at 800 °C, and only at ~ 246.8 nm of depth, Al-Ti-N and Al-Ti-N-O bonds 

were observed at ~ 397 eV [22, 26, 29]. At further depths, the intensity of the N 1s peak 

increased and starting from the near surface scale these observations represented the N-depletion 

in the coating, see Fig. 8a. Less significant N-depletion was detected on the coating treated at 900 

14 

 
°C, where BE of N 1s assigned to the Al-Ti-N becomes visible already at ~ 64 nm and along the 

whole sputtered scale thickness in the coating, Fig. 8b.  

In summary, a less protective oxide scale is observed for the coating treated a 900 °C, where a 

mixed- thermally grown oxide scale was obtained after 5 h of treatment. This can be the result of 

the lack of Al-flux to sustain the continuous growth of the Al2O3 scale and the simultaneous 

thermal decomposition of the Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings into its single nitrides and with subsequent 

N2-release. The latter could be an explanation for mass-gain loss after 225 min of oxidation 

observed in Fig. 3, in addition to the local spallation events. 

TEM evaluation after treatment in Ar at 1000 °C 

Even though the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coating withstands the thermal treatment in Ar at 1000 °C/5h, the 

partial oxidation of the nitride coating was evident after the TGA, XRD and XPS analysis. Fig. 9 

shows the cross-sectional view of the sample treated in Ar at 1000 °C/5h, where four different 

oxide layers can be clearly observed along the thermally grown oxide thickness. STEM images 

show a ~ 90-nm aluminum oxide layer formed at the top coating (zone V), only Ti-traces (less 

than 0.5 at. %) were measured in this zone. Beneath the Al2O3 layer, a porous Al-rich layer of ~ 

155 nm was found (zone IV). In this zone, the layer is based on Al-rich oxides with relatively low 

Ti contents (< 6 at. %) and clear absence of nitrogen. The porous structure of this layer can be 

related with the N2-release as a result of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coating degradation upon treatment. 

The next oxide layer (zone III) appeared at the coating depth of about 245 nm with a compact 

(Al,Ti)-rich oxide layer structure, but with considerably higher Ti-content and N-traces. At ~ 330 

nm, a Ti-rich layer with low Al-content was identified (zone II). This layer holds high amounts of 

nitrogen and about half oxygen content compared to the first three oxide layers near the top 

surface. Table I summarizes the average chemical composition in at. % of each oxidized layer of 

15 

 
the nitride coating after treatment at 1000 °C/5h in Ar. It is important to consider that the STEM 

image has roughly estimated oxides and oxi-nitrides stoichiometry based on the average chemical 

composition of the TEM-EDS analysis. 

Table II displays various AlxTi1-xN (x = 0.47, 0.5, 0.6, 0.66, 0.7) nitride compositions and thermal 

treatments conditions (gas, temperatures and times). Most of the oxidation/treatment 

investigations have been carried out in either pure oxygen or air and only Yang et al [21] reported 

oxidation results after treatment in Ar. This analysis displays that mainly α-Al2O3 and rutile and 

anatase TiO2 phase(s) are formed upon oxidation in air, this is due to the high oxygen content, 

and only few investigations have suggested the formation of complex AlxTiyOz oxides [21] under 

low-oxygen atmospheres. No further information about the oxides and transition phases and/or 

compositions was mentioned. In addition, none of them reported the presence of oxy-nitrides 

phases. Our study suggests that oxidation under low oxygen content follows a complex reaction 

pathway, probably forming intermediate species such as oxy-nitrides (Al-rich, Al + Ti-rich, Ti-

rich) and oxides (i.e. AlTiON, AlTiO, Al2TiO5) before full oxidation into α-Al2O3 (containing Ti 

traces) and rutile TiO2. 

3.4 Pin on disk tests in Ar jet of the arc PVD c-Al0.66Ti0.33N-AISI M2 system 

Friction coefficient vs. distance of the arc PVD Al0.66Ti0.33N coating as a function of temperature 

in Argon jet is shown in Fig. 10. Considering the tribological pair (α-Al2O3 ball and c-

Al0.66Ti0.33N coating), their poisons ratio (ν), E-module (E) and the applied load of 5 N, an 

estimated Hertzian contact pressure of 1.64 GPa was reached. At room temperature, a stable CoF 

= 0.2 up to 10,000 cycles was obtained. A relative short stage of asperities removal was observed 

during this test at RT and relatively low CoF values were obtained through the pin-on-disk test in 

Ar. Optical images of the coatings (Fig 11a.) indicate adhesion in the center of the wear track due 

16 

 
to plastically deformed particles that cause ploughing of the surface. Cracks result from abrasive 

wear due to the presence of particles with high hardness and induced stresses during ploughing. 

Crack opening, oriented opposite to the pin-on-disk movement indicate that cracks are caused by 

tensile stresses. Upon heating at 700 and 800 °C in Ar, Al0.66Ti0.33N reached a CoF ~ 0.6 for 

about 50 m with short stages of asperity removal; then, CoF decreased to 0.2 at 700 °C and 0.35 

at 800 °C after 10,000 cycles. Instabilities and local variations on the CoF are associated to the 

dynamical nature of the wear test. CoF decrease is related to particles being formed and removed 

inside the wear track where wear behavior might be the result of brittle and/or hard oxide layer(s) 

removal, while nitride and oxy-nitride particles present high hardness and certain plastic 

deformation resistance. 

Oxide crystals grown upon temperature and time may act as lubricant layers and might be 

partially or fully removed at some point of the wear track resulting in CoF changes. Phases such 

as TiO2 and sub-stoichiometric TiOx oxides are related to CoF decrease and increased lubricity 

[41]. The test performed at 700 °C (Fig. 11b) shows a reduction of particle adhesion on the 

surface, these are signs of micro-scratching and the main reason of cracking. Micro-plough 

identified in our tests is associated to wear caused by relatively small (generally micro-size order) 

hard particles, while cracking randomly oriented indicates fatigue and embrittlement of the 

substrate due to the high temperature. The wear track of the coating tested at 800 °C (Fig. 11c) 

showed a morphology similar to that observed at 700 °C, cracks are randomly oriented and might 

be related to steel substrate fatigue and embrittlement. However, feathery like cracks oriented 

opposite to sample rotation are observed at the track edges. These type of cracks are produced by 

tensile stresses induced in the back of the pin during rotation on the surface. Moreover, elasticity 

reduction of the system due to applied high temperature must be taken into account. Additionally 

oxidation occurred to some extent, and it is possible that the Al0.66Ti0.33N coating surface 

17 

 
becomes fragile promoting this failure mode. The coating worn at 900 °C (Fig. 11d) showed a 

rarefied surface in the wear track with a large number of small particles, presumably oxides 

adhered to the surface formed by the high temperature and tribo-corrosion, which produced 

coating micro-scratching and ploughing.  No cracking on the coating surface, associated with 

fatigue, reduced elasticity and increased fragility were observed. This is an indication that particle 

adhesion might be responsible for the stable CoF values (0.55 – 0.6) at 900 °C. Wear track 

inspection suggested high wear and abrasion as the predominant processes resulting from 

relatively high contact stresses applied on the surface (1.642 GPa). On the other hand, although 

the coating was tribo-protected with argon jet, the increased working temperature promoted 

oxidation and elasticity decrease of the coating-substrate system. These two phenomena are 

associated with brittle failure mode and surface fatigue. At 900 °C, a large amount of small 

coating particles adhered to the wear track, oxide and oxy-nitrides mixtures, maintained the CoF 

below 0.6. 

3.5 XRD evaluation after Tribology in Ar-jet 

Grazing incidence XRD analysis of the Al0.66Ti0.33N-AISI M2 steel samples after pin-on-disk 

tests are presented in Fig. 12. After test at RT, peaks of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coating are clearly 

identified and no indications of oxidation processes were found. Surface amorphization after 

samples tests at 700 and 800 °C could be related to precursor phases before forming stable 

oxides,  see 2θ values between ~ 50 and 60° in Fig. 12. First indications of Al2O3 formation (2θ = 

25.3°) and TiO2 (2θ = 54.3°) are detected after tribology at 800 °C. These oxides evolve and 

growth clearly after testing at 900 °C. 

3.6 Scratch tests after Tribology in Ar-jet 

18 

 
Critical loads of the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings after tribology in Ar jet are shown in Fig. 13. At RT 

the coating displayed cohesive failures composed of conforming cracks, typical of a hard coating 

deposited on a ductile substrate, Fig. 14a. Upon load increase, recovery spallation at the edges of 

the scratch track is observed. This is caused by the substrate elastic recovery and cohesive 

cracking of the coating. In the scratch center, signs of buckling which are characterized by 

irregularly spaced arc-like patches and partial coating delamination appeared. These defects are 

due to fragile characteristics of the nitride; however, no complete delamination of the coating was 

observed, Fig. 14. This result indicates that regardless the high contact pressure applied during 

scratch test, the coating-substrate system has beneficial synergy in terms of adhesion strength. 

Upon temperature increases, progressive reduction of cohesive critical loads (Lc1) were 

observed. This effect is characterized by buckling-type spallation of the coating, see Fig. 13. On 

the other hand, critical adhesive loads (Lc2) composed mainly of wedging-type spallation were 

observed in the scratch track, Fig. 14. Detrimental effects on adhesion and brittleness raise occur 

due to the localized formation of oxides which were detected by XRD analysis, which produce 

composition gradients, increasing surface tensions and internal stress in the coating. In addition, 

residual stress increases generated by the thermal expansion of the system, tend to affect 

interfacial coherence and reduce the fracture toughness [42, 43]. However, in the present 

adhesion tests full delamination of the oxidized coatings in argon jet was not observed. This 

indicates that despite the fragile nature of the oxide scale and the adhesive faults measured during 

scratch, the coating was still strongly bonded to the steel. 

4. Conclusions 

The c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings were deposited on polycrystalline alumina plates by applying the arc-

PVD method. In the as-coated state, the c-Al0.66Ti0.33N layer already contained a small fraction of 

oxygen. These coatings withstand the exposure to high purity Ar (99.997 %) at 700 and 800 °C, 

19 

 
showing almost no oxidation, only detected by the XPS analysis. In general, the TGA curves 

under these experimental conditions are very sensitive to changes upon the temperature treatment 

and surely affected by phenomena such as micro-crack formation and partial coating micro-

spallation due to the alumina surface roughness. The linear oxidation behavior observed at 700 

and 800 °C, suggest that oxidation reaction is mainly controlled by single phase oxide growth. 

Parabolic mass-gain was measured at temperatures below 900 °C, while linear mass-gain was 

observed at 1000 °C suggesting the oxidation process not being limited by diffusion. 

The obtained results showed that using Ar (low oxygen content) can slow down the reactions 

occurring with oxygen and shed light into the details and paths of the nitride oxidation processes. 

According to the XRD-evaluation, the nitrides were only slightly oxidized at 900 °C and more 

severely oxidized at the 1000 °C/5h treatment. XRD diffraction inspection between 700 and 900 

°C indicate that oxide species such as c-TiO, c-Al0.54Ti2.46O0.28N4.58 and α-Al2TiO5 might 

participate during coating oxidation; and at certain temperatures (~ 850° - 900 °C) the spinodal 

decomposition of the nitride coating must be considered as well. Different oxidation scenarios are 

possible considering the non-spinodal region (at 800 °C and below) where nitrides might oxidize 

without phase decomposition and the spinodal region (at 900 °C and higher) where c-

Al0.66Ti0.33N first decomposes into c-AlN (or h-AlN) + c-TiN and then these phases might 

oxidize. 

The XPS analysis of the depth profiling of the oxidized c-Al0.66Ti0.33N coatings provided 

additional insights into the oxides being formed. According to the detected BEs, the coating 

surface was already slightly oxidized at 700 °C/5h in Ar. At this temperature, the nitride 

transformed into an Al-based oxide and no other oxides were detected at the top surface. But, an 

open question is, if there is any α-alumina being formed at this temperature and time. 

20 

 
The depth profiling analysis of the coatings exposed to Ar at 800 and 900 °C indicate the co-

existence of both Ti- and Al-based oxides such as TiO2, AlTiOxNy, α –Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 in the 

scale. The c-Al0.66Ti0.33N nitride partially withstood the treatments in Ar up to 900 °C. At this 

temperature, the nitride transformed into the rutile and probably an additional AlTiON oxy-

nitride phase with low Ti-content. Interestingly, the oxide layers displayed no sharp boundary 

edges, but gradual transitions from one oxide to the next phase starting with an Al2O3-rich zone 

near the top surface, followed-by a mix-oxide region and lastly, a TiO2-rich zone at 500 nm 

coating depth. The thermal treatment at 1000 °C/5h resulted in the oxidation of about one third of 

the total coating thickness. This sample clearly showed four oxide and oxy-nitride layers; Al2O3 

at the top (probably α), succeeded by an Al-rich oxide layer with low Ti-content (< 6 at. %), then 

an (Al, Ti)-rich oxy-nitride (~ 32.4 at. % Al) containing N-traces (< 3 at. % N) and a transition 

(Ti, Al)-rich oxy-nitride layer with low Al-content (~ 7 at. % Al) at the boundary with the coating 

nitride. These findings display the complexity of the oxidation processes of c-Al0.66Ti0.33N at the 

microscopic level. 

Friction coefficient increased upon temperature increments showing relatively short stages of 

asperity removal; however, particle abrasion dominated the wear behavior during tribology tests. 

At RT, combined effects of high scratching, ploughing and adhesion due to hard particles with 

low plastic deformation was observed. As the temperature increased, a mixture of small particle 

brittle oxides, hard nitrides and oxi-nitrides are formed, which induced micro-ploughing, abrasion 

and adhesion damage. High temperature pin-on-disk tests showed high oxide/oxi-nitride adhesion 

on the coating surface preventing friction coefficient to further diminish during the stabilization 

stages. 

Adhesion tests showed a slight reduction of cohesive and adhesive critical loads after exposure to 

temperature and Ar. These changes are associated to coating degradation near the top surface due 

21 

 
to fragile top oxide layers (p.ej. rutile at 900 °C) and formation of various Al-rich and Ti-rich 

oxides/oxy-nitrides layers. At some stage, scratch load increase and penetrated into the coating 

upon load evolution, displaying the characteristic failure modes such as buckling and wedge 

spallation of the hard nitride deposited on a plastic substrate. The absence of gross spallation, or 

complete separation of the coating, that could be described as Lc3, indicate that despite the 

identified fragile failures, the coating-substrate still preserved high synergy after exposure to 

temperature in Ar.
