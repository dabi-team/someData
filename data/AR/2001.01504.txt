Abstract: This paper develops a full-state feedback controller that damps out oscillations in trafﬁc
density and trafﬁc velocity whose dynamical behavior is governed by the linearized two-class Aw-
Rascle (AR) model. Thereby, the trafﬁc is considered to be in the congested regime and subdivided
in two classes whereas each class represents vehicles with the same size and driver’s behavior. The
macroscopic second-order two-class AR model consists of four ﬁrst order hyperbolic partial differential
equations (PDEs) and introduces a concept of area occupancy to depict the mixed density of two-class
vehicles in the trafﬁc. Moreover, the linearized model equations show heterodirectional behavior with
both positive and negative characteristic speeds in the congested regime. The control objective is to
achieve convergence to a constant equilibrium in ﬁnite time. The control input is realized by ramp
metering acting at the outlet of the considered track section. The backstepping method is employed
to design full-state feedback for the 4 × 4 hyperbolic PDEs. The performance of the full-state feedback
controller is veriﬁed by simulation.

Keywords: Multi-class trafﬁc model, PDE control, Backstepping, Full state feedback controller.

1. INTRODUCTION

A common issue in everyday life is congested trafﬁc. Since
more and more people own a car, highways become more
crowded leading to a problem of growing impact. A well-
known phenomenon that occurs in congested trafﬁc is stop
and go trafﬁc. In fact, stop and go trafﬁc is characterized by
oscillations in trafﬁc density and velocity causing higher fuel
consumption and a higher risk of accidents.
Trafﬁc models can be employed to investigate stop and go traf-
ﬁc as well as developing solutions to avoid this phenomenon.
They are categorized in microscopic, mesoscopic and macro-
scopic models. Since macroscopic models describe trafﬁc as a
distributed parameter system in trafﬁc densities, ﬂows or veloc-
ities, they are more suitable to investigate density and veloc-
ity oscillations. Their model equations are governed by PDEs
in trafﬁc densities and velocities along an investigated track
section. Moreover, macroscopic trafﬁc models either capture
homogeneous trafﬁc or heterogeneous trafﬁc. Homogeneous
trafﬁc consists of vehicles whose size and driver’s behavior are
the same, whereas heterogeneous considers trafﬁc containing
different classes which are deﬁned as a group of vehicles with
the same properties, see Logghe (2003). For instance, motor-
cycles and trucks as well as tolerant and aggressive drivers
can be distinguished in heterogeneous trafﬁc yielding a dif-
ferent dynamical behavior. Notice that a macroscopic trafﬁc
model that covers heterogeneous trafﬁc and hence introduces
multiple classes of vehicles is denoted as macroscopic multi-
class trafﬁc model. First-order macroscopic multi-class trafﬁc
models, like Wong and Wong (2002), Van Lint et al. (2008), Fan
and Work (2015), and second-order models, e.g. Gupta and
Katiyar (2007), Jiang and Wu (2004), Tang et al. (2009), are

through the Baden-

distinguished in literature depending on whether a second PDE
is introduced to model the velocity dynamics of each class.
The main focus of this paper is on the extended AR model
presented in Mohan and Ramadurai (2017) which is a nonlinear
second-order multi-class trafﬁc model. Therein, the concept
of area occupancy is introduced yielding a coupling between
the vehicle classes. In this work, trafﬁc contains two classes.
Thus, the extended AR model is evaluated for two classes and
introduced as the two-class AR trafﬁc model.
Control of macroscopic trafﬁc models is addressed in previous
work. For instance, Karafyllis et al. (2018) introduces a macro-
scopic second-order trafﬁc model consisting of two PDEs and
develops a stabilizing boundary feedback law only depending
on the inlet speed. The corresponding control law is deduced
by formulating a boundary condition for the characteristic form
of the model. Furthermore, Bekiaris-Liberis and Delis (2019)
considers an Aw-Rascle-Zhang-type model describing trafﬁc
that is equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control yielding a spa-
tially distributed input. The corresponding linearized system is
unstable, but is stabilized by a feedback law that eliminates the
source term. In addition, control design for multi-class trafﬁc is
carried out in Deo et al. (2009), Liu et al. (2016) and Pasquale
et al. (2015). Whereas Deo et al. (2009) focuses on a model pre-
dictive control approach for a macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow model
extended to multi-class ﬂows, Pasquale et al. (2015) presents an
optimal control problem and numerical solution algorithm with
respect to the total emissions and total time spent for a trafﬁc
model distinguishing between two classes. Moreover, Liu et al.
(2016) develops a model predictive controller for multi-class
trafﬁc and emission models.
Trafﬁc management systems like ramp metering or variable
speed limits can be employed to damp the density and velocity
oscillations yielding evenly distributed trafﬁc on freeways, see
e.g. Yu and Krstic (2018), Yu and Krstic (2019), Zhang and

 
 
 
 
 
 
Prieur (2017). The overall goal of this work is to develop a full
state feedback controller in order to damp out trafﬁc density
and velocity oscillations in ﬁnite time. Similar to a valve at the
end of a pipe, a ramp metering system is thus assumed to be
installed at the end of the investigated track section yielding
a boundary control problem. In this work, the backstepping
technique, see e.g. Deutscher (2017), Di Meglio et al. (2013), is
employed to achieve the damping in ﬁnite time. The control
design is carried out for a heterodirectional system of 3 + 1
transport PDEs corresponding to a special case of the results
presented in Hu et al. (2015). Thereby, 3 + 1 transport PDEs
depicts three PDEs with downstream convection and one PDE
with upstream convection. The transport velocities of the trans-
port systems are addressed by the term characteristic speeds in
the following.
Contribution of this paper: this work yields the ﬁrst result
on boundary feedback control of a macroscopic second-order
multi-class trafﬁc model using backstepping. Thus, it con-
tributes to the application of a theoretical control design method
to realistic trafﬁc model. Moreover, it contributes to trafﬁc mod-
eling by investigating the characteristic speeds of the linearized
two-class AR model and identifying that only one characteristic
speed is negative in its congested regime.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the
model equations of the two-class AR model. Furthermore, it
covers the linearization around a constant equilibrium and the
analysis of the characteristic speeds for the resulting linearized
model equations. In a last step, this section presents a trans-
formation into Riemann coordinates. Afterwards, Section 3
deals with the full state feedback design. Therein, the control
objective is formulated, the desired control law is developed
and the result is summarized in a theorem. Simulation results in
order to verify the controller performance are given in Section
4, followed by concluding remarks in Section 5.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

This section presents the two class AR model that models
trafﬁc consisting of two vehicle classes and the control design
model. First, the nonlinear model equations are introduced.
Afterwards, the equations are linearized around a constant
equilibrium yielding the linearized two class AR model. In the
next step, the boundary conditions are discussed and linearized.
Finally, the signs of the characteristic speeds are investigated
and the control design model is deduced by introducing a
transformation into Riemann coordinates.

2.1 Two-class AR model

The Extended AR model in Mohan and Ramadurai (2017) is
formulated for an arbitrary amount of vehicle classes. In this
work, trafﬁc distinguishing two vehicle classes is considered
yielding the two class AR model

∂t ρ1=− ∂x(ρ1v1),

∂t (v1+p1(AO))+v1∂x(v1+p1(AO))=

Ve,1(AO) −v1

∂t ρ2=− ∂x(ρ2v2),

∂t (v2+p2(AO))+v2∂x(v2 + p2(AO))=

Ve,2(AO) −v2
τ2

,

.

The initial conditions are deﬁned as ρi(x, 0) = ρi,0(x) ∈
L ∞([0, L]) as well as vi(x, 0) = vi,0(x) ∈ L ∞([0, L]) and the
boundary conditions (10) are discussed later on. The trafﬁc
density and velocity of vehicle class i are denoted by ρi(x,t)

and vi(x,t) on the domain (x,t) ∈ (0, L) × (0, ∞), whereas L
is the length of the considered track section. In general, the
trafﬁc density is the amount of vehicles per unit length. The
four nonlinear ﬁrst-order hyperbolic PDEs (1) are coupled and
represent conservation laws. The terms on the right hand side
of (1b) and (1d) describe the adaption of the vehicles to their
desired velocity in adaption time τi. According to the simpliﬁed
deﬁnition in Mohan and Ramadurai (2017), the area occupancy
measurement is deﬁned as

AO(ρ1, ρ2) =

a1Lρ1 + a2Lρ2
W L

(2)

and thus depends on both trafﬁc densities. The parameter ai
is the surface that is occupied by one vehicle of a class.
Additionally, W is the width of the investigated track section.
Physically interpreted, AO is the percentage of road space that
is occupied if vehicles of class one are distributed with density
ρ1(x,t) and vehicles of class two are distributed with density
ρ2(x,t) along the considered track section. The trafﬁc pressure

depend on the area occupancy. The trafﬁc pressure models the
reaction to other vehicles. Qualitatively, it holds that a more
crowded freeway yields higher AO leading to a higher experi-
enced trafﬁc pressure. The equilibrium speed AO relationship
describes the desired velocities of the vehicles and is based on
the model of Greenshield Greenshields et al. (1935). Moreover,
both functions introduce three additional parameters: the free-
ﬂow velocity Vi > 0, trafﬁc pressure exponent γi > 1 and max-
imum area occupancy 0 < AO < 1. The free-ﬂow velocity Vi
represents the desired velocity without taking other vehicles
into account, the trafﬁc pressure exponent γi is a degree of
freedom to adjust the pressure function to realistic data and the
maximum area occupancy AOi is the area occupancy value that
implies whether a vehicle class is jammed, i.e. desired velocity
Ve,i(AOi) = 0. In fact, it holds that Ve,i(AO) = Vi − pi(AO).
Thus, a more crowded freeway implying higher trafﬁc pressure
yields a more reduced desired velocity. Besides, notice that
Ve,i(0) = Vi which equals to the deﬁnition of Vi.
2.2 Linearized two-class AR model

Next, the two class AR model is linearized around the constant

the steady state velocities follow, if the steady state densities
are determined. The perturbations around the steady state are
deﬁned as

(6)
and are summarized in the state vector z = ( ˜ρ1, ˜v1, ˜ρ2, ˜v2)T .
Consequently, the linearized two-class AR model is given by

where i, j = 1, 2.
Four boundary conditions are discussed in order to complete
the linearized two-class AR model. First, it is assumed that
the incoming trafﬁc ﬂow has ﬁxed densities. Moreover, the
remaining two conditions describe that the overall trafﬁc ﬂow
entering and leaving the investigated track section is constant.
Thus, the boundary conditions are given by
i , q1(0,t) + q2(0,t) = ρ ∗
1 v∗

2 +U(t).

1 + ρ ∗
Since the trafﬁc ﬂow is deﬁned as qi = ρivi, the latter conditions
lead to nonlinear equations in ρi and vi. The control input U(t)
is realized by a ramp metering at the outlet of the track section
regulating the leaving trafﬁc ﬂow similar to a valve at the end of
a pipe. Notice that U(t) describes the perturbation of the trafﬁc
ﬂow caused by the ramp. The linearized boundary conditions
then become

2.3 Free-ﬂow/congested regime analysis

Based on the steady state around which the linearization is
carried out and the parameters occurring in the PDEs, the lin-
earized two class AR model captures two fundamentally differ-
ent dynamical behaviors: either the described trafﬁc is in the
free-ﬂow regime or in the congested regime. In the free-ﬂow
regime, all characteristic speeds are positive and there is only
information propagating downstream. This behavior is clariﬁed
as homo-directional behavior because the information travels in
one direction. However, trafﬁc in the congested regime is char-
acterized by information propagating upstream, i.e. heterodi-
rectional behavior. In the following, the amount of negative
characteristic speeds in the latter regime is investigated. Notice
that stop and go trafﬁc only occurs in the congested regime,
thus analyzing the dynamical behavior in this regime is crucial
for the control design. The characteristic speeds

λi = v∗

where

are computed by calculating the eigenvalues of the Jacobian
J−1
t Jx. In fact, Zhang et al. (2006) shows that the relation

2

(cid:1)2+4β11β22ρ ∗

(13)

λ4 ≤ min{λ1, λ2} ≤ λ3 ≤ max{λ1, λ2}
(14)
holds. The characteristic speeds λ1 > 0 and λ2 > 0 are the
steady state velocities which are positive due to model validity.
Furthermore, λ3 correspond to the trafﬁc ﬂow that is caused
by the vehicles overtaking each other yielding a positive sign.
Thus, λ4 is the only characteristic speed that may be smaller

than zero. In the following, the trafﬁc captured by the linearized
two-class AR model (7) is in the congested regime, if

(8)

λ1, λ2, λ3 > 0, λ4 < 0

(15)

and the trafﬁc is in free-ﬂow regime if

λ1, λ2, λ3, λ4 > 0.
(16)
Throughout the rest of this paper, it is assumed that the steady
state densities and parameters are chosen such that (15) is
satisﬁed.

2.4 Control design model

Next, the linearized two-class model (7) with (11) is trans-
formed into Riemann coordinates yielding the control design
model. The preparation covers two goals. First, the characteris-
tic form of the PDEs is deduced. Second, the states are sorted
such that the characteristic speeds occur in ascending order and
the diagonal elements of the source term become zero in order
to keep the computations concise and increase the readability
by adapting to the notation of Hu et al. (2015). Notice that an
unique ascending order of the characteristic speeds is deﬁned
as soon as one of the steady state velocities is larger than the
other. In this work, v∗
2 is assumed and thus the ﬁrst vehicle
class corresponds to faster vehicles. The anticipated order of
characteristic speeds is then given by λ4 < 0 < λ2 < λ3 < λ1.

putations concise, the ﬁrst three coordinates are summarized in
w = (w1, w2, w3)T . This transformation is applied to the system
with decoupled partial time derivatives, i.e. the model equations
that result from multiplying (7) with J−1

(23)
Since the trafﬁc is in congested regime and thus λ4 < 0, (19a)
captures the information propagating downstream and (19b)
the information propagating upstream. The coefﬁcients ¯Ji j are
omitted here. They are bounded and do not change their sign
on the whole domain of x. As a remark, the input of the

The transformation (17) also needs to be applied to the bound-
ary conditions (11). For that reason, the boundary conditions
are formulated with the state vector z and afterwards the trans-
formation law is inserted yielding the conditions

(25b)
The matrices ¯Q0 and ¯R1 are straightforward to compute and thus
omitted due to space constraints.
In the following, (19) and (25) are considered as control design
model. The performed transformation is invertible and there-
fore the linearized two-class AR model and the control design
model have the same stability properties.

3. FULL STATE FEEDBACK CONTROL DESIGN

In the following, a full-state feedback control design for the sys-
tem of four coupled hyperbolic PDEs given by (19) with bound-
ary conditions (25) is carried out in order to achieve ﬁnite time
convergence to zero for initial conditions w j(x, 0) ∈ L ∞[0, L].
The overall goal is to damp out stop-and-go trafﬁc in the con-
gested regime and achieve convergence to the constant steady
state in a ﬁnite time. The term of stop-and-go trafﬁc refers to
oscillations of the density and velocity perturbations around
their constant equilibrium values along the highway. The full-
state feedback controller is designed by applying the backstep-
ping control design, see Hu et al. (2015). The states of the
target system are denoted as (α, β )T , where α = (α1, α2, α3)T .
The kernels of the backstepping transformation are denoted by
K(x, ξ ) = (cid:8)k1 j(x, ξ )(cid:9)
1≤ j≤3 and L11(x, ξ ). Then, the backstep-
ping transformation is deﬁned as
j = 1, 2, 3,

(K(x, ξ )w(ξ ,t)+L11(x, ξ )w4(ξ ,t))dξ .

(26b)
Notice that K(x, ξ ) and L11(x, ξ ) are deﬁned on a triangular
domain T = {0 ≤ ξ ≤ x ≤ 1}. Furthermore, the choice of the
well-posed target system is

The coefﬁcients C+(x, ξ ) ∈ R3×3 and C−(x, ξ ) ∈ R3×1 are
deﬁned on the same triangular domain T and are determined
later on. Besides, the boundary conditions of the target system
are

As shown in Theorem 3.3 of Hu et al. (2015), the kernel
equations (31) and (32) are a well-posed system of equations
and thus there exist unique solutions K(x, ξ ) and L11(x, ξ )
in L∞(T ). Furthermore, differentiating (26a) with respect to
space and time and inserting the obtained derivatives, (26b)
and (19a) in (27a) yields the expressions C−(x, ξ ) and C+(x, ξ ).
Finally, inserting (25b) and (28b) in (26b) evaluated at x = L
and formulating the result with respect to the original physical
variables, i.e. the densities and velocities of both vehicle classes
yields

In the following, the presented results are summarized in a
theorem.
Theorem 1. Consider the linearized two-class AR model (7)
and (11). Notice that the ﬁrst vehicle class is assumed to
represent faster vehicles with equilibrium speeds being higher
than the ones of the second vehicle class. Assuming that the
investigated trafﬁc is in congested regime and the initial trafﬁc
density and velocity proﬁles satisfy

˜ρ1(x, 0), ˜v1(x, 0), ˜ρ2(x, 0), ˜v2(x, 0) ∈ L ∞([0, L]),

(36)
applying the control law (33) in (11c) yields convergence of the
density and velocity perturbations to the equilibrium at zero

˜ρe,1(x) ≡ ˜ve,1(x) ≡ ˜ρe,2(x) ≡ ˜ve,2(x) ≡ 0
(37)
in ﬁnite time tF given by (30). The kernel K(x, ξ ) is the solution
of the well-posed kernel equations (32) and L11(x, ξ ) follows
according to (31).

4. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

The performance of the developed full state feedback controller
is veriﬁed by a numerical simulation of the linearized model in
the next step. All introduced parameters and the equilibrium
densities ρ ∗
2 are chosen such that λ4 < λ2 < λ3 < λ1
holds for the characteristic speeds. Hence, the trafﬁc is in
congested regime. Moreover, the initial proﬁles are given by

and represent stop-and-go trafﬁc since they describe alternating
areas of dense, slow trafﬁc and light, fast trafﬁc.
Figure 1 shows the obtained open loop simulation results of
the linearized two class AR model for density and velocity
of vehicle class 1, whereas Figure 2 depicts the results for
vehicle class 2. The initial proﬁles are highlighted with a blue
line. The densities and velocities at the outlet, i.e. ρi(L,t) and
vi(L,t), are marked in red. The ﬁgures show that the initial stop-
and-go oscillations are ampliﬁed. Furthermore, the closed loop
simulation results are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
green line indicates the ﬁnite convergence time tF ≈ 237 s. All
states converge to their equilibrium values as suggested by the
theory.

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The presented feedback control result is only a ﬁrst step of con-
trol design for multi-class trafﬁc models using backstepping.
A ﬁrst future research topic is given by the extension of the
results to trafﬁc that is subdivided in three classes, e.g. dis-
tinguishing between motorcycles, average vehicles and trucks.
The corresponding three-class AR model then consists of six
nonlinear ﬁrst order hyperbolic PDEs. Consequently, the signs
of the characteristic speeds in the congested regime and their
relation to the two-class result need to be investigated for that
case.
Typically, it is hard and expensive to measure the entire state
vector at every point along the investigated track section lead-
ing to a second future research topic: the full state feedback
controller can be extended to an output feedback controller.
Hence, the state vector is only measured at a single point and an
observer generates estimates of the state vector at the remaining
points. Afterwards, the developed control law of this work is
reformulated based on these estimates.
