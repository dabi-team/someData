ABSTRACT

We report ﬂare ribbons approach (FRA) during a multiple-ribbon M-class
ﬂare on 2015 November 4 in NOAA AR 12443, obtained by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The ﬂare consisted
of a pair of main ribbons and two pairs of secondary ribbons. The two pairs of
secondary ribbons were formed later than the appearance of main ribbons, with
respective time delays of 15 and 19 minutes. The negative-polarity main ribbon
spread outward faster than the ﬁrst secondary ribbon with the same polarity in
front of it, and thus the FRA was generated. Just before their encounter, the main
ribbon was darkening drastically and its intensity decreased by about 70 % in 2
minutes, implying the suppression of main-phase reconnection that produced two
main ribbons. The FRA caused the deﬂection of the main ribbon to the direction
of secondary ribbon with a deﬂection angle of about 60◦. Post-approach arcade
was formed about 2 minutes later and the downﬂows were detected along the new
arcade with velocities of 35−40 km s−1, indicative of the magnetic restructuring
during the process of FRA. We suggest that there are three topological domains
with footpoints outlined by the three pairs of ribbons. Close proximity of these
domains leads to deﬂection of the ribbons in agreement with the magnetic ﬁeld
topology.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares are among the most intense manifestations of energy release on the Sun. The
magnetic reconnection process in the corona produces accelerated particles, which ﬂow down

along the reconnected ﬁeld lines and generate ﬂare ribbons in the lower solar atmosphere.
The intersection of newly reconnected ﬁeld lines with the chromosphere and transition region
corresponds to ﬂare ribbons observed in Hα and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (Forbes et al.
2006; Shibata & Magara 2011). The shape, location and dynamics of ﬂare ribbons, as well
as their relationship to magnetic ﬁelds provide a signiﬁcant amount of information about the
three-dimensional (3D) magnetic conﬁguration involved in the reconnection process (Gor-
bachev et al. 1988; Savcheva et al. 2015).

Flare ribbons are widely observed to spread systematically outwards from the polarity
inversion line (PIL), which is explained by the ascending reconnection site (Fletcher et al.
2011; Schmieder et al. 2015). Moreover, ﬂare ribbons also exhibit the apparent elongation
motion along the PIL with the maximum apparent speed comparable to the local Alfv´en
speed (Qiu 2009; Li & Zhang 2009; Pontin et al. 2016; Priest & Longcope 2017). Sometimes
unidirectional brightening propagation of two ﬂare ribbons parallel to the PIL is associated
with an asymmetric ﬁlament eruption, that is the “zipper” motion (Tripathi et al. 2006; Liu
et al. 2009). Diﬀerent from the zipping brightening motion, ﬂare ribbons are also observed
to move in opposite directions parallel to the PIL (Su et al. 2007; Li & Zhang 2014). Qiu
et al. (2010, 2017) suggested that a large magnetic guide ﬁeld parallel to the reconnection
electric ﬁeld may be present during the elongation motion of ﬂare ribbons. Priest & D´emoulin
(1995), Masson et al. (2009) and Aulanier et al. (2006) proposed that 3D slipping magnetic
reconnection at a null point, separator or quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) can account for the
elongation motion. Recently, the apparent slipping motions of ﬂare loops and ribbons during
eruptive ﬂares were investigated by Li & Zhang (2014, 2015) and Dud´ık et al. (2014, 2016).
The slippage exhibited a quasi-periodic pattern with a period of 3−6 minutes and its speed
reached several tens of km s−1.

The theoretical models usually assume a very simple magnetic ﬁeld structure and gen-
erate two approximately parallel ribbons (e.g., standard ﬂare model in the review of Shibata
& Magara 2011; sheared arcade model in Somov et al. 2002). However, eruptive ﬂares gen-
erally occur in complicated multipolar active regions (ARs) and display a three or multiple
ribbon structure (Liu et al. 2015; Bamba et al. 2017). Wang et al. (2014) reported two
successive eruptive ﬂares with three ribbons parallel to the PIL and suggested that magnetic
reconnection in a fan−spine magnetic topology produced the complicated ribbons. Multiple-
ribbon ﬂares consists of two parallel ribbons and several other secondary ribbons far from
the center of the AR (Mandrini et al. 2006; Zheng et al. 2015, 2016). Zhang et al. (2014)
found that more than a half of X-class ﬂares in the 24th solar cycle were associated with
secondary ribbons and suggested multiple sets of magnetic loops were involved in the re-
connection process (Chandra et al. 2009). Direct magnetic connections between secondary
ribbons and the main ﬂare could be responsible for the brightening of the secondary ribbons.

– 3 –

These connections are either by magnetic loops (Herant et al. 1989; Maia et al. 2003) or
by a system of null points, separatrices, and QSLs at high altitude (Schrijver & Title 2011).
The brightness enhancement of secondary ribbons is generally weaker than the main central
ﬂare ribbons and appears later than the main ribbons (Zhang et al. 2014; Schmieder et al.
2015).

The observations with high temporal and spatial resolutions from the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014) allow an assessment of the low atmo-
spheric structure in unprecedented detail. In this paper, we report a multiple-ribbon ﬂare
with GOES-class M3.7 in the ﬂare productive NOAA AR 12443 on 2015 November 4. Two
pairs of secondary ribbons are successively formed after the appearance of main ribbons
and the approach between one main ribbon and a secondary ribbon residing at the same
magnetic polarity is ﬁrstly presented. To our knowledge, the observations of ﬂare ribbons
approach (FRA) have never been reported before. We will investigate the dynamic evolution
and magnetic connectivity of multiple ribbons, and focus on the details and physical process
of the FRA.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

We combine data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) and
the IRIS to investigate the multiple-ribbon ﬂare and the process of FRA. The Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the SDO provides multi-ﬁlter, near-
simultaneous full-Sun images with a resolution of ∼0′′.6 per pixel and a cadence of 12 seconds.
The observations of AIA 1600, 304, 171 and 131 ˚A channels are used in this work. The
relations of ﬂare ribbons with magnetic ﬁelds are also studied by using the full-disk line-of-
sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et
al. 2012). We concentrate on the IRIS slit-jaw images (SJIs) of 1400 ˚A with a high spatial
sampling of ∼0′′.33 per pixel and a cadence of about 12 seconds. The ﬁeld-of-view (FOV)
of the SJIs covers the central part of the ﬂaring region, and the process of FRA can be well
detected. The SJI 1400 ˚A images are dominated by Si iv line emission from the transition
region and continuum emission from the low chromosphere (Tian et al. 2014). The IRIS
slit crosses the newly formed arcade during the approach process in a large, coarse, 16-step
raster covering a FOV of 30′′×119′′ in 50 s with 2′′ step size. Each raster step takes about 3 s,
and the spectral sampling is ∼0.05 ˚A per pixel. The IRIS spectra of the Si iv λ1402.77 line
were analyzed and ﬁtted by a single-Gaussian function to obtain the Doppler shifts along
the arcade (Peter et al. 2014).

3. Results

3.1. Flux Rope Eruptions and Evolution of Multiple Ribbons

The analyzed M3.7 ﬂare on 2015 November 4 was initiated at 13:31 UT and peaked at
13:52 UT from the GOES SXR 1−8 ˚A ﬂux data (Figure 4(a)). About 10 minutes before
the ﬂare started, a ﬁlament at the north of AR 12443 was activated and showed an evident
clockwise rotation around the ﬁlament axis (Figure 1(a); see Animation 304-eruption). The
ﬁlament gradually developed into two ﬁlament structures F1 and F2 as seen from the 304 ˚A
images (Figure 1(b)). Then the ﬁlament materials of F1 and F2 moved in opposite directions
from their crossing location (white arrows in Figure 1(b)), implying the occurrence of tether-
cutting reconnection (Moore et al. 2001; Chen et al. 2016). We obtained the stack plots along
the moving directions of ﬁlament materials and then calculated the bidirectional velocities of
about 150 km s−1 and 210 km s−1 for F1 and F2. Meanwhile, two quasi-parallel ﬂare ribbons
R1 and R2 appeared underlying the eruptive ﬁlament F1. Starting from 13:32 UT, R2 at
the east appeared and propagated to southeast at a speed of about 120 km s−1 (green arrows
in Figures 1 (c)-(d)), which ﬁnally formed a hook-shaped segment with a length of about
80 Mm. In the high-temperature channel of 131 ˚A (about 11 MK), two ﬂux ropes FR1 and
FR2 were detected (Figures 1 (e)-(f); see Animation 131-eruption), with their lower parts
corresponding to the two ﬁlaments F1 and F2 (Li & Zhang 2013; Cheng et al. 2014). The
ﬂux rope FR1 exhibited an asymmetric eruption with its eastern footpoints slipping along
the hook of R2 (Figures 1 (g)-(h)) and ﬁnally delineated a “triangle-shaped ﬂag” surface.
The observations are similar to the event presented by Li & Zhang (2014) and imply the
occurrence of slipping magnetic reconnection. R1 resided at negative-polarity magnetic ﬁelds
and R2 at positive-polarity ﬁelds (Figure 1(e)).

About 15 minutes after the ﬂare onset (∼ 13:46 UT), a pair of secondary ribbons PSR1
and NSR1 appeared adjacent to two main ribbons R1 and R2 (Figures 2(a)-(b)). Later
on, the interaction between ribbons R1 and NSR1 was initiated when R1 chased up NSR1
(Figure 2(c)). The detailed analysis of the approach process is carried out in Figures 3-5.
The west cusp of ribbon R2 extended to the north and encountered the ribbon PSR1 (green
arrows in Figure 2(c)-(d)). Then R2 and PSR1 approached each other and a brightening
between the R2 and PSR1 ribbons was observed (see 13:50 UT in Animation 304-eruption).
Afterwards the brightening propagated to the north along the hook-shaped segment of R2.
Another pair of secondary ribbons PSR2 and NSR2 were detected about 4 minutes after
the appearance of PSR1 and NSR1 (Figure 2(c)). Afterwards, the intensities and widths of
PSR2 and NSR2 were both increased at 13:56 UT (Figure 2(d). The 131 ˚A observations
showed the existence of hot coronal loops connecting PSR1 and NSR1 (Figures 2(f)-(g)),
indicative of their conjugated property. Similarly, the high-temperature loops connecting

– 5 –

PSR2 and NSR2 can also be detected (red dotted curves in Figure 2(h)).

The overlay of the ﬂare ribbon time evolution over the magnetogram is displayed in
Figure 2(e). The color indicates the time of the ribbon brightness observed at SDO 1600
˚A and IRIS 1400 ˚A. The west ribbons NSR1 and NSR2 anchored at the negative-polarity
magnetic ﬁelds and the east ones at the positive-polarity ﬁelds. It shows that the generally
parallel portions of two main ribbons R1 and R2 exhibit an evident separation motion
with the high-temperature ﬂare loops connecting them. Two pairs of secondary ribbons
are formed later than the main ribbons. Each pair of secondary ribbons has corresponding
coronal loops that appear right after the formation of these ribbons. We suggest that there
are three topological domains with footpoints outlined by the three pairs of ribbons. The
approach process of ribbons R1 and NSR1 is interpreted as the interaction of two diﬀerent
topological domains.

3.2. Approach Process Between Two Ribbons

The ribbons R1, NSR1 and NSR2 at the west were clearly observed by the IRIS, and thus
the details of ﬂare ribbon interactions can be well obtained. The main ribbon R1 continually
spread towards the southwest as the ﬂare developed (Figures 3(a)-(c); see Animation 1400-
approach). At 13:46 UT, the secondary ribbon NSR1 was formed in front of R1 and was
composed of numerous slipping dot-like substructures (Figure 3(b)). Later on, the arch-
shaped ribbon NSR1 moved southward with a smaller speed than R1, resulting in the distance
between NSR1 and R1 becoming smaller and smaller. About 4 minutes later, another
secondary ribbon NSR2 appeared at the south of NSR1 (Figure 3(c)). Then the three
ribbons R1, NSR1 and NSR2 kept moving to the south. Starting from 13:51 UT, the ribbon
R1 was darkening with the intensity decrease of about 70 % when R1 moved close to NSR1
(Figure 3(d)). From then on, the ribbon R1 continually approached to NSR1 and evident
brightening appeared at the merging location (Figure 3(e)). From about 13:55 UT, the
brightening at the west was detected to propagate from the interaction location to the west
(black arrows in Figures 3(f)-(h)). The direction of brightening propagation was almost
consistent with NSR1 (Figure 3(i)). After examining the 1400 ˚A data, we suggest that the
newly formed brightening could be associated with the evolving ribbon R1 deﬂected by the
NSR1 ribbon by about 60◦ (see Figure 3(i)).

The spatio-temporal relations among the three ribbons R1, NSR1 and NSR2 were pre-
sented in Figure 4. The propagating velocity of R1 decreased from 13.1 km s−1 at 13:38 UT
to 4.8 km s−1 at 13:51 UT just before the approach (Figure 4(b)). About 15 minutes after
the ﬂare started, NSR1 appeared and propagated southward at a speed of about 1.5 km s−1

– 6 –

(Figure 4(a)). NSR2 was formed about 19 minutes after the ﬂare onset and moved in front
of NSR1 at a velocity of 4.3 km s−1. Then evident darkening process of R1 was started at
about 13:51 UT when R1 and NSR1 were very close to each other (distance of 1.2 Mm) and
the intensity decreased by 70 % in 2 minutes (Figure 4(b)). The FRA of R1 and NSR1 were
initiated at 13:53 UT (blue dash-dotted lines in Figure 4) and caused the brightening at the
interaction location. Afterwards, the ribbon R1 was deﬂected to the direction of NSR1. As
seen from the stack plot (Figure 4(c)) along slice “C−D” (blue line in Figure 3(f)), there
were two times of propagations of deﬂected R1 with their velocities reaching about 71 and
54 km s−1.

Associated with the FRA, part of the arcade was newly formed at the northeast of
the interaction location from about 13:55 UT (Figures 5(a) and (d)). Then the mass ﬂows
from the top of the arcade to its two ends appeared and a large part of the arcade could be
detected in 171 ˚A and 1400 ˚A channels (Figures 5(b) and (e)). The east end of the arcade
was located at the positive-polarity ﬁelds and the west end anchored in the negative-polarity
ﬁelds (contours in Figure 5(b)). The top part of the arcade could also be observed at 1600
˚A (Figure 5(c)), implying the lower-temperature component of the arcade. At about 13:59
UT, the arcade became more extended and its west leg was connected with the deﬂected R1
(Figure 5(f)). By plotting the space-time map of 1400 ˚A (Figure 5(g)) along slice “E−F”
(Figure 5(f)), we have inferred the speeds of downﬂows with values of 35 and 40 km s−1.
As seen from the space-time map, the arcade was formed about 2 minutes later than the
initiation of FRA (blue and white dash dotted lines), and thus we name the newly formed
arcade as post-approach arcade (PAA). The spectra of Si iv λ1402.77 line at three diﬀerent
locations (diamonds in Figures 5(e)-(f)) of PAA were displayed in Figures 5(h)-(i). At 13:57
UT, two east locations showed blueshifts of about 9 and 12 km s−1 while the west location
exhibited a redshift of 5 km s−1 (Figure 5(h)). About 2 minutes later, the blueshifts at two
east locations reached about 13 and 11 km s−1 and the redshift at the west leg increased to
8 km s−1 (Figure 5(i)).

4. Summary and Discussion

We present the IRIS and SDO observations of the approach process between one main
ribbon R1 and a secondary ribbon NSR1 with the same magnetic polarity during a multiple-
ribbon M3.7 ﬂare on 2015 November 4. The two main ribbons of the ﬂare had a portion
generally parallel to each other and also a hook-shaped segment at the east of the positive-
polarity ribbon, which propagated towards the southeast at a speed of about 120 km s−1.
Meanwhile the east footpoints of the associated ﬂux rope displayed a slipping motion along

– 7 –

the hook, delineating a “triangle-shaped ﬂag surface”. Two pairs of secondary ribbons were
formed successively at the periphery of two main ribbons in the late stage of the impulsive
phase. R1 spread outward much faster than NSR1 in front of it and the distance between
the two ribbons became smaller and smaller. R1 began to darken evidently and its intensity
decreased by 70 % in 2 minutes when it came very close to NSR1 (less than 1.2 Mm). Then
R1 approached to NSR1 and caused the deﬂection of ribbon R1 with a deﬂection angle of
about 60◦. The deﬂected R1 propagated in the direction of NSR1 at velocities of 50−70 km
s−1. A new loop structure PAA was formed during the FRA, with its west leg connecting
with the deﬂected R1. The downﬂows along the PAA had Doppler shifts of about 10 km s−1
and projected velocities of 40 km s−1 in the plan of sky.

The secondary ribbons were formed in pairs and sequentially at the periphery of main
ribbons after the ﬂare onset, with respective time delays of 15 and 19 minutes for the ﬁrst
and second pairs of secondary ribbons. The conjugate footpoints of each pair of secondary
ribbons were connected by high-temperature coronal loops. Previous studies suggested that
the initial magnetic reconnections in main ﬂare regions triggered the high-latitude null-point
reconnections in a fan-spine-like topology (Joshi et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015) or long-distance
loop-loop interactions (Maia et al. 2003; Chandra et al. 2009) and thus produced the
secondary ribbons. The secondary ribbons in our observations were composed of numerous
small-scale slipping substructures, which correspond to the footpoints of reconnected ﬁeld
lines (Li & Zhang 2015). We suggest that the ﬂux rope eruption pushes overlying loops
against the neighboring topological domain and then magnetic reconnections between the
erupting domain and its neighboring one result in the formation of the ﬁrst pair of secondary
ribbons. Later on, another topological domain is disturbed after the appearance of ribbons
PSR1 and NSR1 and generates the second pair of secondary ribbons.

Associated with the FRA of ribbons R1 and NSR1, several new observational features
have been identiﬁed. The ribbons R1 and NSR1 corresponded to the ends of reconnected
magnetic lines in two diﬀerent topological domains (Fletcher et al. 2011; Schmieder et al.
2015). Associated with the separation motion of two main ribbons, magnetic reconnection
in the center region was gradually spreading towards the border of the topological domain.
When magnetic reconnection occurred at the border of the topological domain, it encoun-
tered with another neighboring topological domain and resulted in the phenomenon of FRA.
We suggest that the interaction location corresponded to the boundary of two diﬀerent do-
mains. The close proximity of these domains caused the deﬂection of ribbon R1 with a
deﬂection angle of about 60◦. The deﬂected ribbon propagated in the direction consistent
with NSR1, in agreement with the magnetic topology of the neighboring domain. The rapid
“darkening” of R1 just before the approach implied that coronal magnetic reconnection was
suppressed at the boundary of diﬀerent magnetic systems. Furthermore, the newly formed

– 8 –

loop structure PAA indicated that magnetic restructuring was involved in the process of
FRA. The downﬂows along the PAA were simultaneously detected based on the imaging
and spectral observations, which probably corresponded to reconnection downﬂows. How-
ever, the triggering mechanism of secondary ribbons and physical process of FRA are still
In the future, more observational and simulation studies are required to
open questions.

ﬂares.

November 4 (see Animations 304-eruption and 131-eruption). The green arrow in panel (a)
denotes the clockwise rotation of the ﬁlament and the white arrows in panel (b) represent
the bidirectional ﬂows along two ﬁlaments F1 and F2. R1 and R2 are two main ﬂare ribbons,
and green arrows in panels (c)-(d) point to the propagating direction of the hooked segment
of R2. Red dotted lines in panels (e)-(f) outline the main axes of ﬂux ropes FR1 and FR2.
Blue solid lines in panel (e) show the morphologies of ribbons R1 and R2 at 13:39 UT.

Fig. 2.— Appearance of two pairs of secondary ribbons (PSR1-NSR1, PSR2-NSR2) and
their interactions with main ribbons R1 and R2 in the late phase of the ﬂare. The green and
white rectangles in panel (a) respectively denote the FOVs of the images in panels (b)-(d),
panels (f)-(h) and Figure 5. The green rectangle in panel (c) shows the FOV of Figure 3.
Panel (e) shows the SDO/HMI LOS magnetogram with an overlay of the positions of newly
brightened ribbons. The color indicates the time of the ribbon brightness from 13:40 UT to
14:00 UT in the images of 1600 ˚A and 1400 ˚A. Green lines in panel (g) show the ﬁrst pair
of secondary ribbons PSR1 and NSR1 and high-temperature loops connecting them. Red
lines in panel (h) denote the second pair of secondary ribbons PSR2 and NSR2 and their
connecting loops. Their duplications are also shown in panel (e).

Fig. 3.— Time sequence of IRIS 1400 ˚A images and SDO/HMI LOS magnetogram showing
the approach process between ribbons R1 and NSR1 (see Animation 1400-approach). Red
arrows in panels (b)-(c) represent the propagating direction of R1. Blue and red dash-dotted
lines in panel (c) outline ribbons R1 and NSR1, and are duplicated in the magnetogram of
panel (i). Blue lines “A−B” and “C−D” show the cut positions used to obtain the time-
distance plots shown in Figures 4(a) and (c). Black arrows in panels (f)-(h) denote the
propagation of deﬂected ribbon after the ribbons approach (FRA) of R1 and NSR1. The
green and blue curves in panels (g)-(h) are the brightness of deﬂected ribbon, and their
duplications are also shown in panel (i).

Fig. 4.— Panel (a): time-distance plot along slice “A−B” (blue line in Figure 3(e)) at 1400
˚A. The blue curve shows GOES SXR 1−8 ˚A ﬂux of the M3.7 ﬂare. Blue dash-dotted line
denotes the start time of FRA between R1 and NSR1. Panel (b): evolution of intensity
(black curve) and propagating velocity (blue curve) of R1. The calculated region of the
intensity and velocity is within the black curves in panel (a). Panel (c): time-distance plot
along slice “C−D” (blue line in Figure 3(f)). Red dashed lines outline the propagations of
the deﬂected ribbon.

Fig. 5.— Panels (a)-(f): multi-wavelength observations of the post-approach arcade (PAA)
during the approach process. The red and blue contours in panel (b) are the magnetic
ﬁelds at ±500 G levels at the ends of the PAA. Dashed lines in panels (e)-(f) show the slit
locations and the diamonds denote the intersections of the PAA and the slit. Dash-dotted
curve “E−F” in panel (f) shows the cut position used to obtain the time-distance plot shown
in panel (g). Panel (g): time-distance plot along slice “E−F” at 1400 ˚A. Blue and white
dash dotted lines respectively represent the start of FRA and the appearance of PAA. Panel
(h): proﬁles of the Si iv λ1402.77 line at diﬀerent locations (diamonds in panel (e)) along
the PAA. The dotted curves are the corresponding single-Gaussian ﬁtting proﬁles. Panel (i):
similar to panel (h) but for the diamond locations in panel (f).
