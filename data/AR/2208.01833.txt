ABSTRACT

We carry out a photometric search for new cataclysmic variable stars (CVs), with the goal of iden-
tiﬁcation for candidates of AR Scorpii-type binary systems. We select GAIA sources that are likely
associated with unidentiﬁed X-ray sources, and analyze the light curves taken by the Zwicky Transient
Facility, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and Lulin One-meter Telescope in Taiwan. We inves-
tigate eight sources as candidates for CVs, among which six sources are new identiﬁcations. Another
two sources have been recognized as CVs in previous studies, but no detailed investigations have been
done. We identify two eclipsing systems that are associated with an unidentiﬁed XMM-Newton or
Swift source, and one promising candidate for polar associated with an unidentiﬁed ASKA source.
Two polar candidates may locate in the so-called period gap of a CV, and the other six candidates
have an orbital period shorter than that of the period gap. Although we do not identify a promising
candidate for AR Scorpii-type binary systems, our study suggests that CV systems that have X-ray
emission and do not show frequent outbursts may have been missed in previous surveys.

1. INTRODUCTION

The cataclysmic variable star (hereafter CV) is a bi-
nary system composed of a white dwarf primary (here-
after WD) and a low-mass main-sequence star (Warner
1995). In the usual CV system, the mass is transferred
from the companion star to the WD, and it forms an
accretion disk extending down to the WD surface or ac-
cretion column on the WD’s pole, toward which the ac-
creting matter is channeled by the WD’s magnetic ﬁeld.
The former and latter systems usually belong to non-
magnetic and magnetic CV systems, respectively. A
nonmagnetic CV shows frequent outbursts due to an
instability of the accretion disk (dwarf nova). Magnetic
CVs, in which the WD’s magnetic ﬁeld is BW D > 105 G,
are divided into two types, namely, intermediate polar
(hereafter IP) and polar. In an IP system, the spin pe-
riod of the WD is diﬀerent from the orbital period of
the system. Polar has the strongest magnetic ﬁeld and
shows a spin-orbit phase synchronization. CVs are usu-

takata@hust.edu.cn

ally observed in the optical to X-ray bands, for which
emission originates from the boundary layer of the ac-
cretion disk, the companion star surface, or the WD
surface/accretion column.

Numerous eﬀorts to identify new CVs and candidates
have been made in previous works, and the number of
known CVs is rapidly increasing with recent photometric
and spectroscopic all-sky surveys (Ritter & Kolb 1998;
Coppejans et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2021; Szkody et al.
2021). The methods of conﬁrming CVs are mainly di-
vided into three types, namely, the observation of dwarf-
nova outbursts, identiﬁcation of orbital/WD spin vari-
ations in photometric light curves, and conﬁrmation
of CV-like spectral properties. The Open Cataclysmic
Variable Catalog (Jackim et al. 2020) oﬀers a vast list
of the known CVs and the CV candidates found in pre-
vious studies.

Among known WD binary systems, AR Scorpii is
one of the special classes in terms of the observed
emission properties. The emission in the radio to X-
ray bands is modulating with a spin period of WD
(∼ 117 s) and/or a beat period (∼ 118 s) between
the WD spin and orbital motion, and its broadband

spectrum is described by a nonthermal emission process
plus thermal emission from the companion star surface
(Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017; Stanway et al.
2018; Takata et al. 2018). Although there has not yet
been a direct measurement of the magnetic ﬁeld of a
WD (Garnavich et al. 2021a), the observational proper-
ties suggest a magnetic WD binary system. The emis-
sion in the optical and X-ray bands is also modulating
with the orbital period of ∼ 3.56 hr, and the shape of the
orbital light curve suggests heating of the dayside of the
companion star at a rate of Lirr ∼ 1032−33 erg s−1, most
of which is converted into emission in the IR/optical/UV
bands. The multiwavelength spectrum exhibits no fea-
tures of emission from an accretion disk in the system,
and the emission from the WD is fainter than the ob-
served optical emission, which cannot be the source of
the heating of the companion star. It is therefore sug-
gested that the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD may be the
energy source of the heating, and it is interacting with
the companion star or outﬂow matter from the com-
panion (Takata et al. 2017; Katz 2017; Lyutikov et al.
2020). AR Scorpii may be classiﬁed as an IP in the
sense that the spin period of the magnetic WD is shorter
than the orbital period. However, the X-ray luminosity
is of the order of LX ∼ 4 × 1030 erg s−1, which is two
to three orders of magnitude lower than that of typical
IPs, in which the X-ray emission originated from the ac-
cretion column on the WD. Attention has been paid to
AR Scorpii to study the origin of the magnetic ﬁeld of
the WD (Schreiber et al. 2021; Wilson et al. 2021).

An AR Scorpii-type binary system will be a new as-
trophysical laboratory for nonthermal processes, and
it may be the origin of cosmic-ray electrons. A sec-
ond AR Scorpii, however, has not yet been identiﬁed,
and the population in the galaxy has not been un-
derstood. AE Aquarii/LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9
(Pelisoli et al. 2022) are known as a magnetic WD sys-
tem in the propeller phase, and they are similar to
AR Scorpii in the sense that (i) no accretion disk is
formed and (ii) the system contains a fast-spinning
WD (Patterson 1979; Wynn et al. 1997; Pretorius et al.
2021; Garnavich et al. 2021b). On the other hand, there
is no evidence of heating of the companion star, and
the existence of the nonthermal emission extending in
broad energy bands (radio to X-ray/gamma-ray bands)
has not been established; for AE Aquarii, although ev-
idence of the nonthermal emission in X-ray and TeV
energy bands has been reported (Meintjes et al. 1994;
Terada et al. 2008), the results have not been con-
ﬁrmed by follow-up observations (Kitaguchi et al. 2014;
Aleksi´c et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016). CTCV J2056-3014
and V1460 Her also contain fast-spinning WD, and they

are classiﬁed as X-ray faint IPs (Lopes de Oliveira et al.
2020; Ashley et al. 2020). Spectroscopic studies suggest
that CTCV J2056-3014 and V1460 Her contain accre-
tion disks and hence their WDs will have a weak mag-
netic ﬁeld.

AR Scorpii has faint X-ray emission and has not shown
a dwarf-nova-type outburst. Moreover, AR Scorpii con-
tains a WD with a relatively cool surface temperature,
and does not show a deep eclipsing feature in the light
curve. Binary systems with such featureless emission
properties may have at ﬁrst glance, been missed by pre-
vious surveys, and may require a diﬀerent approach
to conﬁrm new AR Scorpii-type binary systems.
In
this study, we take the approach of ﬁnding new CVs
in unidentiﬁed X-ray sources, since the X-ray emission
as a result of the interaction between the WD’s mag-
netic ﬁeld and the companion star is a unique property
of AR Scorpii. The structure of this paper is as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes our strategy and method for
searching for new CV candidates. Section 3 presents
eight candidates including six new identiﬁcations and
two sources that have been recognized as CV candidates
but have not been listed in the current catalogs. Al-
though our new candidates will not be categorized as
a new AR Scorpii-type binary system, searching in the
unidentiﬁed X-ray sources oﬀers an alternative approach
to identifying new CV systems. In section 4, we compare
the UV and X-ray emission properties of our candidates
with those of known CVs.

2. SEARCHING METHOD

2.1. candidate selection

First, we select candidates of the WD/low-mass
main-sequence star binary systems from the GAIA
DR2 source list (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018).
In
the GAIA color-magnitude diagram, AR Scorpii,
CTCV J2056-3014 and the typical CV systems are lo-
cated between the main-sequence and the cooling se-
quence of the WD (Figure 1).
In this work, there-
fore, we limit the range of the search with a color of
0.5 < GBP −GRP < 1.5 (GBP and GRP are blue and red
magnitude deﬁned by the GAIA photometric system, re-
spectively) and a magnitude of 9 < MG < 12. We do not
limit the range of the parallax, but restrict the magni-
tude of the error with a cut parallax_over_error > 5
in the query. To obtain a clean sample, we refer to
Lindegren et al. (2018) and apply the conditions that

• phot_bp_mean_flux_over_error > 8

• phot_rp_mean_flux_over_error > 10

• astrometric_excess_noise < 1

• phot_bp_rp_excess_factor < 2.0+0.06*

power(phot_bp_mean_mag-phot_rp_mean_mag,2)

• phot_bp_rp_excess_factor > 1.0+0.015*

power(phot_bp_mean_mag-phot_rp_mean_mag,2)

• visibility_periods_used > 5.

We downloaded a catalog of the GAIA sources using
astroquery (Ginsburg et al. 2019).

We search for a possible X-ray counterpart of the se-
lected GAIA sources in (i) the ROSAT all-sky survey
bright source catalog (Voges et al. 1999), (ii) the second
Swift-XRT point-source catalog (Evans et al. 2020) and
(iii) XMM-Newton DR-10 source catalog (Webb et al.
2020). We select the GAIA sources that are located
within 10” from the center of the X-ray source, and then
we remove the sources that have been already identiﬁed
as a CV or other types of objects by checking the cata-
logs of CVs (Ritter & Kolb 2003; Coppejans et al. 2016;
Jackim et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2021; Szkody et al. 2021),
and the SIMBAD astronomical database1.

After selecting the GAIA sources that are potentially
associated with unidentiﬁed X-ray sources, we cross
match them with sources observed by the Zwicky Tran-
sient Facility DR-8 objects (hereafter ZTF, Masci et al.
2019). We select a potential candidate of CVs based on
(i) identiﬁcation of a signature of an outburst and (ii) a
periodic search with a Lomb-Scargle periodogram (here-
after LS, Lomb 1976). We download the light curves
from the Infrared Science Archive 2, and use the r-
band data to search for a periodic signal. We apply the
barycentric correction to the photon arrival time using
astropy3. We ﬁnd, on the other hand, that since the
ZTF observation for our candidates (section 3) provides
only 500 − 1000 data points during 2018-2021 observa-
tions, the data quality may not be enough to study the
detailed properties of the light curve (e.g.
identifying
eclipse feature, section 3.1).

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (hereafter
TESS, Ricker et al. 2014) provide the light curves of
the sources by monitoring for a month, and also pho-
tometric data of sources that are out of the ﬁeld of
view of ZTF. For our targets, TESS full-frame im-
ages (hereafter FFIs) provides the data taken every
10 minutes or 30 minutes, for which Nyquist frequen-
cies are FN ∼ 72 day−1 and ∼ 24 day−1, respec-
tively. We extract the light curve of the pixels around
the source region from TESS-FFIs using TESS analy-

sis tools, eleanor (Feinstein et al. 2019; Brasseur et al.
2019) and Lightkurve (Lightkurve Collaboration et al.
2018). We note that since several GAIA sources are
usually located at one pixel, TESS data alone cannot
tell us which source produces the periodic signal in a
light curve extracted from TESS-FFIs. To complement
ZTF and TESS observations, we carry out photomet-
ric observations for some of our targets with the Lulin
One-meter Telescope (hereafter LOT) in Taiwan.

2.2. LS periodogram

First, we produce an LS periodogram for each source
by taking into account the Gaussian and uncorrelated
errors that are usually provided in the archival data (or
by usual data processing). We search for a possible pe-
riodic signal in 1 day−1 < f < 50 − 150 day−1, in which
the maximum frequency depends on the time resolution
of the observation. We estimate the false alarm proba-
bility (hereafter FAP) of the signal with the methods of
Baluev (2008) and of the bootstrap (VanderPlas 2018).
For an accreting system, it is proposed to investigate
the eﬀect of the time-correlated noise on the LS peri-
odogram (VanderPlas 2018). Based on the correlated
noise model of Delisle et al. (2020), we, therefore, pro-
duce an LS periodogram with diﬀerent parameters of
the noise model (Appendix A). We ﬁnd that the LS pe-
riodogram of TESS data is insensitive to time-correlated
noise model. For ZTF data, although the noise model
can change the shape of the LS periodogram, it is less
eﬀective in the periodic signals presented in this study
(Table 1); but see section 3.1 and Appendix A for
in which one periodic signal may be

related to time-correlated noise.
fore, we present an LS periodogram created with the
time uncorrelated noise. The correlated noise model and
some results of the LS periodogram are presented in Ap-
pendix A.

3. RESULTS

We downloaded the catalog of ∼ 2×105 GAIA sources
selected based on criteria described in section 2, and
identify 29 sources that are potential counterparts of
the unidentiﬁed X-ray sources. After searching for pe-
riod signals in the light curves based on ZTF, TESS, and
LOT data, we identify seven sources as being CV can-
didates (Tables 1-3, sections 3.1-3.5), for which we can

obtain a periodic signal with at least two diﬀerent facil-
ities. Two of them have been recognized as candidates
for CVs in previous studies, but they are not listed in
the current catalogs. We also present four other sources
(Table 4, section 3.6), for which no useful ZTF data are
available, but TESS-FFI data indicates a periodic sig-
nal, and one of them is a promising candidate for polar.
LS periodograms and light curves obtained from ZTF
and TESS data for 11 candidates are presented in Fig-
ures A2-B3.

3.1. GAIA DR2 1415247906500831744

4XMM J172959.0+522948 (hereafter, 4XMMJ1729) is
an unidentiﬁed X-ray source, and its position is consis-
tent with GAIA DR2 1415247906500831744 (hereafter
G141, Figure 2). Based on the parallax measured by

GAIA, the distance to this source is ∼ 532 pc. There
is a nearby source (GAIA DR2 1415247906499736448),
whose position from our target is separated by ∼ 2′′.
Since the GAIA G-band mean magnitude of the nearby
source, ∼ 20, is larger than G141 (∼ 18.3 mag), con-
tamination will have less inﬂuence on the optical light
curve observed for our target.

Figure 2 (top right panel) shows the r-band light curve
for G141 measured by ZTF (ZTF18aampﬀv). We ﬁnd
in the ﬁgure that the target frequently repeats small
outbursts or transitions between high and low states on
a timesale of months, which may indicate an accreting
system. The amplitude is δm > 2, which is relatively
large compared to those seen in the ZTF light curves
for other candidates presented in this study. We search

with the LS periodogram (left panel of Figure 3), and
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant signal at fZT F ∼ 46.9991(9) day−1 (∼
0.021 days), where the uncertainty denotes the Fourier
resolution of the observation (namely, the inverse of the
time span covered by the observation).

The TESS observation covered the source region sev-
eral times (Table 2). The middle panel of Figure 3 shows
an LS periodogram of the light curve of the TESS data,
the sector 50 (Figure 2). The time resolution of the sec-
tor 50 is about 10 minutes, and it has the capability to
searching for a signal of fZT F ∼ 47 day−1. We ﬁnd,
however, that the LS periodogram is dominated by the
signal with ∼ 22 day−1, which is indicated with 2F0 in

the ﬁgure, its harmonics and aliasing signals. We check
the data of sector 47, which also does not show a signif-
icant periodic signal at fZT F . Since the data of sectors
17 and 24-26 were taken approximately every 30 min-
utes, they cannot be used to search for a periodic signal
of fZT F . The signal of ∼ 22 day−1 is conﬁrmed in all
data (although sector 40 also covers the source, the data
is contaminated by unusually high background emission
or noise).

To collect evidence of a binary nature, we carried
out a photometric observation with LOT (2021, Oc-
tober 4th and 5th, Table 2). The light curve clearly
shows that G141 is an eclipsing binary system (Fig-
ure 4), and the observation covered three eclipse events
that repeat at a frequency of F0 = 11 ± 4 day−1, sug-
gesting that G141 is a binary system with an orbital
period of Porb ∼ 0.09 day. With the time resolution of
∼2 minutes for the LOT data, we estimate that each
eclipse lasts ∼ 15 minutes, and the eclipse proﬁle does
not change during the observation. With the LOT data,
we unable to conﬁrm a periodic signal corresponding to
fZT F ∼ 47 day−1.

The top panel of Figure 5 shows the folded light curve
of the TESS data with a frequency of F0 ∼ 11 day−1,
and clearly shows an eclipsing feature at the orbital
phase of ∼ 0.2 in the light curve. We also ﬁnd the
secondary eclipse around the orbital phase ∼ 0.7, which
is shallower than that of the primary eclipse. This il-
lustrates that the signal of the second harmonic (F1 =
2F0 ∼ 22.296 day−1) is stronger than that of the funda-
mental signal in the LS periodogram.

4XMMJ1729 was covered by the ﬁeld of view, when
XMM-Newton observations were carried out for two
stars (HD 150798 and HD 159181) in 2002. We extract

epproc for PN of the XMM-Newton Science Analysis
Software (XMMSAS, version 19.0.1). Although the ob-
servation was carried out with a total exposure of about
20 ks, the quality of the data is insuﬃcient to measure
the spectral properties, since (i) the target is located at
the edge of the ﬁeld of view in all EPIC data and (ii) the
observation is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by background ﬂare-
like events. We create an LS periodogram for the light
curve (Figure 2) of PN data; we do not analyze MOS
data due to an insuﬃcient count rate. As can be seen in
Figure 3, the window eﬀect dominates the periodogram,
and a signiﬁcant periodic signal at fZT F ∼ 47 day−1
is not identiﬁed, although an indication may exist. Fig-
ure 5 shows the X-ray light curve folded with the orbital
period F0 = 11.148 day−1. Although a lower count rate
is observed at ∼ 0 ∼ 0.3 orbital phase, a deeper obser-
vation is required to investigate the eclipse feature in
X-ray bands.

We obtain an ∼ 5 ks Swift observation for
4XMMJ1729 (Table 3). We extract a cleaned event
ﬁle with Xselect under HEASoft ver.6-29, and ﬁt the
spectrum with Xspec ver.12.12. Since we could not

constrain the spectral model because of insuﬃcient pho-
ton counts, we ﬁt the spectrum with a single power-
law function (Table 3). Using the distance measured by
GAIA (Table 1), we estimate the luminosity in the 0.3-
10 keV band as LX = 4.5+1.9
−1.3 × 1031(d/532 pc)2 erg s−1
(hydrogen column density of NH = 1.9+5.4
−1.9 × 1021 cm−2
and photon index of Γ = 0.5+0.6

−0.5).

We have not found a signiﬁcant periodic signal with
fZT F ∼ 47 day−1 in TESS, LOT and XMM-Newton
data. In Appendix A, therefore, we carry out a further
investigation of the LS periodogram of the ZTF data
and ﬁnd the possibility that the signal is caused by the
time-correlated noise.

1RXS J185013.9+242222 has already been recognized as
a dwarf nova by previous observation of the outburst 4.
Since no detailed investigation for this source has been
carried out, we searched for possible orbital modulation
in the photometric data.

First, we searched for periodic signals in a quiescent
state in the ZTF data, but we did not ﬁnd any obvious

periodic signals (except for the window eﬀects) in the
periodogram (Figure 7). TESS observed this source in
2020 June during a stage of the small outburst (Fig-
ure 6), and the data was taken approximately every
30 minutes. We extract the light curve with 4 pixels
around the target (left panel of Figure 6). In the LS-
periodogram, we ﬁnd two strong signals at 8.88(4) day−1
(∼ 0.11 days) and 39.11(4) day−1 (∼ 0.026 days), either
of which is likely the aliasing of the sampling frequency.
Since the extracted light curves with 4 pixels contain
several sources (left panel of Figure 7), the TESS ob-
servation alone cannot support the detected signal orig-
inating from G453.

We conﬁrm the binary nature of G453 with LOT. We
carried out the observations with r-band (2021 July 3)

and g-band (2021 July 4) ﬁlters, for which one observa-
tion covered the source with an exposure of ∼ 2 − 2.5
hr (Table 2). As indicated in Figure 6, the LOT ob-
servation was also carried out during a small outburst,
which could be a re-brightening after the large outburst
happen around MJD 59300.
In the LS-periodogram
(Figure 7) and the observed light curve (Figure 8),
we conﬁrm evidence of periodic modulation at F0 =
37.3 ± 1 day−1, which is close to the TESS result.

Although we cannot ﬁrmly conclude the origin of the
periodic signal with the current photometric data, the
signal F0 is likely related to the orbital period. From
the shape of the light curve taken by LOT, we can ex-
pect that the orbital period is double the photometric
period, namely Porb ∼ 2 × 1/F0 ∼ 0.05 days; e.g. the
light curve with the r-band ﬁlter may be more consis-
tent with modulation caused by the elliptical shape of
the companion star that ﬁlls the Roche-lobe, and an in-
dication of double-peak structure with the diﬀerent peak
magnitudes in the g-bands (Figure 9).

Another possible origin of the signal F0 is the super-
hump, which is a periodic variation observed emission
from an eccentric disk after the outburst of CVs (Warner
1995). The period of the superhump is several percent
longer (or sometimes shorter) than the orbital period.
Although superhump is usually observed after a super-
outburst of CVs (Osaki 2005; Kato et al. 2014; Hameury

2020), it has also been observed at normal outburst or
re-brightening after a super-outburst (Zhao et al. 2006;
Imada et al. 2012). The ZTF light curve of G453 sug-
gests that there were several re-brightenings after the
large outburst occurred around MJD 59300, and the
LOT observation covered one of re-brightening stages.
Moreover, the previous observations for other dwarf no-
vae conﬁrm a beat signal between the orbital modula-
tion and superhump (Patterson et al. 2000; Kato et al.
2010). In the periodogram of the TESS data for G453
(middle panel of Figure 7), we notice a periodic signal
at ∼ 1.34 day−1 (∼ 0.75 day), which is conﬁrmed only
at the source region, with a signiﬁcance greater than
the 99 % conﬁdence level. This signal can be explained
by the beat signal, if the diﬀerence between the orbital
period and the superhump period is ǫ ∼ 3 − 4 % (i.e.
1.34 day−1 ∼ ǫ × 39 day−1). The TESS light curve
folded with F0 is presented in Figure B2.

(hereafter G207), 2056003803844470528 (G205), and
2162478993740496256 (G216) measured by ZTF, which
are named ZTF 18abrxtii, 18aayefwp, and 17aaapwae,
respectively. For G207 (top panel of Figure 10), for
example, a sudden drop in brightness occurred around
MJD 59050 and the source stayed in a low luminous
state for ∼ 50 day. These three GAIA sources are
selected as the optical counterparts of Swift sources.
Using the distance measured by GAIA, the X-ray lu-
minosity in the 0.3-10 keV energy band is estimated
to be LX ∼ 0.5+0.8
−0.3 × 1031(d/313 pc)2 erg s−1 for
G207, ∼ 1.4+3.4
−0.6 × 1031(d/ 595pc)2erg s−1 for G205 and
∼ 1.2+0.4
−0.3 × 1031(d/429 pc)2erg s−1 for G216, respec-
tively (Table 3).

For these three targets, we can detect signiﬁcant peri-
odic signals in the ZTF and TESS (Tables 1 and 2).
The photometric periodic signals in the ZTF light
curves are fZT F = 28.575(1) day−1 (∼ 0.035 day) for
G207, 24.595(1) day−1 (∼ 0.041 day) for G205 and
22.175(1) day−1 (∼ 0.045 day) for G216, respectively.
We also obtain consistent periodic signals in the TESS
light curves.

We carried out photometric observations for the three
sources with LOT. For G207 (Figure 11), although the
data ﬂuctuation is signiﬁcant, we ﬁnd an eclipsing fea-
ture in the light curve. Figure 11 shows that the source

became fainter around MJD 0.034 (+59475.6) and MJD

0.094 (+59475.6), and the time interval between two
epochs is consistent with an integer multiple of the pho-
tometric period of 1/fZT F ∼ 0.035 day. The orbital pe-
riod, however, will be double of the photometric period,
since the observation in left panel of Figure 11 should
cover another eclipse if the orbital period is ∼ 0.035 day.
ZTF/TESS light curves may indicate a secondary eclipse
with a shallower depth (Figure B2).

For G216 (Figure 12), the light curve indicates a pe-
riodic modulation, and the time interval between two
strong peaks is consistent with the photometric period
of 1/fZT F ∼ 0.045 day, and the LOT light curve is con-
sistent with the TESS/ZTF light curves (Figure B2).
Hence, G216 is a binary system with an orbital pe-
riod of 0.045 day. For G205, we could carry out only

The ZTF (blue) and TESS (black) light curve folded with a frequency of fZT F = 18.552 day
corresponds to MJD 59398.713391. The horizontal dotted line shows FAP=0.01 estimated with the bootstrap method.

LS-periodogram (left panel) clearly indicates a periodic
signal at F0 = 18.553(1) day−1, which is consistent with
the ﬁnding from ZTF. The folded light curve with fZT F
(right panel of Figure 14) may be described by the main
peak plus a small secondary, rather than a pure sinu-
soidal curve, although the signiﬁcance of the secondary
peak is small. In the LS-periodogram, we can see the
signals at the second harmonics (F1 = 2F0) and the
eﬀect of aliasing with the data sampling frequency of
Fs ∼ 145 day−1, namely Fb = Fs − F0 ∼ 126 day−1 and
Fb1 = Fs − F1 ∼ 108 day−1

In addition to the periodic signals related to F0 and
2F0, the periodogram shows other signals at Fu =
32.17(4) day−1 (∼ 0.031 day) and its harmonics Fu/2.
This signal clearly appears in the TESS data of the sec-

tor 40. To check which pixel of the TESS-FFIs causes
the signal, we extract the light curve of each pixel around
the sources for the observation of sector 40. We ﬁnd that
a signiﬁcant signal with Fu can be detected at one pixel
where the power of the signal with F0 becomes the max-
imum. The periodic signal with F0 can be seen in other
pixels but the power of the signal is lower than that at
the pixel where the Fu signal is found. Hence, the sig-
nal, Fu, may be related to our target, although other
optical sources located in the same pixel (right panel
of Figure 13) cannot be ruled out as the origin of the
signal. We note that LS periodogram of TESS data is
insensitive to the time-correlated noise model discussed
in Appendix A.

−1 (∼ 0.12 day), and the phase zero refers MJD 59398.713391. The TESS observation
with a frequency of fZT F = 8.6499 day
was carried out around MJD 58980-5904 during the outburst.

If the signal Fu is related to G432, then the origin
may be related to the harmonics of F0. Although the
frequency Fu = 32.17(4) day−1 cannot be described by
a simple relation with F0, the frequency Fs − Fu ∼ 6F0,
where Fs ∼ 145 day−1 is the data readout frequency, in-
dicates that the signal Fu is related to the 6th harmonic
of the fundamental frequency. It is not trivial, however,
why the modulation of the 6th harmonic is more evident
than those of the 2nd-5th harmonics. If the frequency
Fu is independent of F0, the signal would be related to
the spin of the WD. We cannot ﬁnd a signiﬁcant periodic
signal at the frequency Fu in the data of sector 14. This
may be due to a large uncertainty of each data point of
the observation or the true signal is Fs −Fu ∼ 111 day−1
(∼ 13 minutes) for which the data of sector 14 cannot
identify. If Fu and F0 are related to the WD spin and
orbital period, respectively, G432 could be a candidate
for IP due to the fact that the X-ray emission dominates
the UV emission, which is a typical property of the emis-
sion of IPs (section 4.1). A data set taken with a higher
cadence is required to identify the origin of Fu.

tailed binary information for the target in the literature,
we search for a possible periodic signal in the ZTF light
curve. After removing the data of the outburst from the
light curve, the LS-periodogram shows a signiﬁcant pe-
riodic signal at fZT F = 8.6499(8) day−1 (∼ 0.115 day).
TESS observation for the region around G452 was car-
ried out in 2020, May and June (sectors 25 and 26) dur-
ing the outburst around MJD 59000 (Figure 15). We
extracted the TESS-FFI light curve and removed a long-
term trend caused by the outburst from the light curve.
We found a periodic signal with F0 = 8.65(2) day−1,
which is consistent with the result of the ZTF obser-
vation. The right panel of Figure 15 shows the folded
light curves of the ZTF and TESS data, which can be de-
scribed by a sinusoidal modulation. As Figure 15 shows,
we also observe a shift in the TESS light curve from
the ZTF light curve, which may be due to the eﬀect
of an outburst during the TESS observation. We do
not ﬁnd another signiﬁcant periodic signal in the TESS
data, which may be consistent with a spin-orbit phase
synchronization of the polar.

3.5. GAIA DR2 4542123181914763648

3.6. Other candidates

We select GAIA DR2 4542123181914763648 (here-
after G452) as a candidate of the optical counterpart of
1RXS J172728.8+132601, for which a 2.5 ks Swift obser-
vation measures the X-ray luminosity of LX = 5.5+14
−3.2 ×
1031(d/502pc)2 erg s−1 with NH = 7.5 × 1021 cm2 (Ta-
ble 3). As the ZTF light curve (ZTF18abttrrr) shows
(left panel of Figure 15), the source repeats outbursts
on a time scale of years; the outburst happened in 2021
was alerted as a GAIA transient source, AT 2021aath
(GAIA21eni, Hodgkin et al. 2021), which was identiﬁed
as a polar type CV. Nevertheless, since there is no de-

We searched for a possible periodic signal of 29 GAIA
DR2 sources, which are potential counterparts of an
unidentiﬁed X-ray source. Table 4 presents four sources,
for which TESS-FFI data provides a periodic signal,
but no enough data points or no data are available
for ZTF observations. As we have mentioned, there
are two observational modes for TESS-FFIs, in which
the data readout time intervals are ∼ 48 day−1 and
∼ 144 day−1, respectively. As shown in Table 4, GAIA
DR2 5360633963010856448 and 5964753754945126528
were observed by two observational modes, and the

 
 
 
periodic signal F0 reported in Table 4 is identiﬁed in
both data sets. For GAIA DR2 2031371479242995584
and 1981213682883140864, on the other hand, data
from only one observational mode is available, and we
cannot discriminate between the true frequency and the
aliasing. We note that due to one pixel of the TESS ob-
servations containing several GAIA sources, we cannot
rule out that the periodic signal is related to another
source.

Among the four sources in Table 4, GAIA DR2
5964753754945126528 (hereafter G596), which shows a
periodic signal F0 ∼ 8.34 day−1 (∼ 0.120 day) in the
TESS data, is a promising candidate for a CV, and its
location is consistent with the X-ray source, AX J1654.3-
4337, which was discovered by the ASCA Galactic plane
survey (Sugizaki et al. 2001). Swift and NuSTAR ob-
servations for this source were carried out in 2020 July-
August with a total exposure of 6.7 ks and 26 ks, re-
spectively. We extract the events and spectra of the
source region with the command nupipeline under
HEASoft ver.6-29 for the NuSTAR data and the pack-
age Xselect for the Swift data.

We group the spectral bins to contain a minimum
of 20 counts in each bin, and ﬁt the spectrum using
Xspec ver.12.12 (Figure 16). We ﬁnd that the spec-
trum in the 0.2-70 keV band is well ﬁtted by the opti-
cally thin thermal plasma emission (tbabs*mekal model
in Xspec) with a temperature of kBT = 8.9+2.0
−1.5 keV and
absorption column density of NH = 2.2+0.08
−0.07×1021 cm−2
(χ2 = 164 for 188 D.O.F.). The luminosity in the
0.2-70 keV band is estimated to be LX = 6.0+0.6
−0.5 ×
1031(d/462 pc)2 erg s−1. The X-ray emission with a
plasma temperature of ∼ 10 keV suggests the emission
from an accretion column on the WD surface, indicating
a magnetic CV system. Moreover, the observed X-ray
luminosity of < 1032 erg s−1 indicates that the source
is not a typical IP, for which the X-ray luminosity is
typically > 1032 erg s−1.

Figure 17 presents the folded light curve of F0 =
8.34 day−1 extracted from the TESS-FFI data. We can
see that the shape of light curve shows a double-peak
structure. Combined with the X-ray spectral properties,
this optical emission likely originated from two magnetic
poles heated by the accretion column, and the modula-
tion is likely due to the WD spin. Since the TESS data
did not indicate other periodic signals longer than this
WD’s spin signal within 10 day, G596/AX J1654.3-4337
may be a polar, although we cannot rule out the possi-
bility of an IP. We do not ﬁnd any periodic signal in the
NuSTAR data, in which a window eﬀect of the observa-
tion dominates the LS-periodogram.

Figure 19. Distribution of UV/X-ray ﬂux ratio with the

In the ﬁgure, we can see so-called pe-
candidates.
riod gap at Porb ∼ 2 − 3 hr,
in which less CVs
have been detected (Spruit & Ritter 1983; Ritter 2010;
Katysheva & Pavlenko 2003; Garraﬀo et al. 2018). The
ﬁgure shows that the nonmagnetic systems (black-ﬁlled
circle) have been detected with a period in the range
of 0.01-1 day. Known IPs (red-ﬁlled circle) and polars
(blue ﬁlled circle), on the other hand, concentrate on the
orbital periods longer and shorter than the period gap,
respectively. We ﬁnd in the ﬁgure that the six CV can-
didates discussed in the current study are located below
the period of the gap. This will be a selection eﬀect be-
cause (i) there is a correlation between the orbital period
and GAIA G-band magnitudes, as seen in top panel of
Figure 18, and (ii) we have selected the candidates with
the condition 9 < MG < 12 of the G-bands magnitude
(Figure 1). AX J1654.3-4337 (pink diamond), which is

 
a polar candidate as discussed in section 3.6, locates in
or close to the period gap. As the bottom panel of Fig-
ure 18 shows, the X-ray luminosity of our candidate,
LX ∼ 1031−32 erg s−1 is relatively larger among the
CVs located below the period gap. This is because we
searched candidates in the X-ray source catalogs of pre-
vious surveys, which may have miss many faint X-ray
sources.

We can see in the ﬁgure that four candidates (G453,
G205, G216, and G432) have an orbital period close to or
shorter than ∼ 0.05 day, which is known as the minimum
orbital period in the standard binary evolution of CVs
(Ritter 2010). We note however that the orbital periods
of G453, G205 and G432 may be double the values in
the ﬁgure (sections 3.3 and 3.4), and hence they may
have an orbital period longer than the minimum period.
Figure 19 shows the distribution of the ﬂux ratio of
the UV band and X-ray band measured by Swift. As
can be seen in the ﬁgure, the ratio is greater than unity
for most of the nonmagnetic system, which is under-
stood by the emission from the boundary layer of the
accretion disk. For magnetic CVs, on the other hand,
the X-ray dominates the UV emission, which is a char-
acteristic of emission from the accretion column (Mukai
2017). Several sources, on the other hand, have a ratio
greater than 10, and the emission is probably dominated
by blackbody emission from the pole with a temperature
of < 50 eV.

We ﬁnd that our candidates have relatively hard spec-
trum (FUV /FX ≤ 1) and the two hardest sources (G432
and G596) are classiﬁed as candidates for magnetic
CVs. For G432, we identify two possible periodic sig-
nals (F0 = 18.5 day−1 and Fu = 32.2 or 111 day−1) in
the TESS data. With the UV/X ﬂux ratio much smaller
than unity, G432 may be a candidate of X-ray faint IP.
For G596, the properties of the optical light curve and
the X-ray spectrum are consistent with a polar, as de-
scribed in section 3.6.

In the unidentiﬁed X-ray source, we searched for new
binary candidates that show emission properties sim-
ilar to those of AR Scorpii, for which (i) no mass is
probably transferred from the companion star to the
WD, (ii) UV emission dominates the X-ray emission,
and (iii) a magnetic WD heats up the companion star.
With current photometric studies, however, we can con-
clude that these candidates do not belong to the AR
Scorpii-type binary system. For example, three candi-
dates (G141, G453 and G454) clearly show dwarf-nova-
type outbursts, suggesting the existence of a mass trans-
fer from the companion to the WD, and thus an accret-
ing system. With a large optical variation (δm ∼ 1.5),
AR Scorpii contains a WD heating up the companion

15

star. The optical curves of our candidates show a smaller
magnitude variation (δm < 1, e.g. Figure 12 for G216
and Figure 13 for G432), and do not show any clear evi-
dence of heating. G596/AX J1654.3-4337 is a promising
candidate for the magnetic system, but it is a polar,
while AR Scorpii is an IP in the sense that the spinning
period is diﬀerent from the orbital period.

Finally, we note that out of our eight candidates, six
systems have not experienced a large outburst in the last
4 years, and have been missed in the previous surveys.
Our study, therefore, will suggest that a large population
of WD binary systems with an inactive mass transfer
could be discovered in future surveys.

In summary, we searched for new CV systems as-
sociated with the unidentiﬁed X-ray sources listed in
ROSAT, Swift and XMM-Newton source catalogs. We
selected the GAIA sources with a g-band magnitude of
9 < MG < 12 and a color 0.5 < GBP − GRP < 1.5, and
identiﬁed 29 sources that are potential counterparts of
the unidentiﬁed X-ray sources. We carried out a photo-
metric study with ZTF, TESS and LOT observations,
and we constrained the orbital periods for the seven
sources (sections 3.1-3.5). Among the seven candidates,
G141 and G207 are eclipsing binary systems, and G141
shows a secondary eclipse with a shallower depth. We
identiﬁed three candidates (G141, G453 and G454), in
which a mass transfer from the companion to WD is ac-
tive, and they exhibit repeated outbursts (Figures 2, 6
and 15). For the other three candidates (G207, G205,
and G216), on the other hand, it is observed that the
source brightness suddenly drops and stays at a low lu-
minous state (Figure 10), suggesting the mass transfer
may be inactive. Based on the detection of two periodic
signals in the light curve and UV/X-ray emission prop-
erties, we can classify G141 and G432 as IP candidates,
although a spectroscopic study is required for conﬁrma-
tion. In addition to seven candidates, we conﬁrmed that
the unidentiﬁed ASKA source, AX J1654.3-4337 (G569),
is a candidate for being a polar. With the current pho-
tometric studies, we could not ﬁnd any candidate for
the AR Scorpii-type WD binary, although we selected
the GAIA sources that had a similar magnitude to AR
Scorpii. AR Scorpii still remains a n unique WD binary
system, and a more sophisticated search (e.g. an optical
survey for unidentiﬁed X-ray source with high cadence)
will be required to ﬁnd a new AR Scorpii-type binary
system.

Figure A1. LS periodograms with correlated noise models (A1) for G141 (left) and G205 (right). The results are for σexp =
1 magnitude. The dashed-dotted lines represent FAT=0.01 estimated from the method of Delisle et al. (2020).

APPENDIX

A. LS PERIODOGRAM WITH TIME-CORRELATED NOISE MODEL

We apply the time-correlated noise model based on Equation (13) of Delisle et al. (2020), and assume the covariance

matrix to follow

Ci,j = δi,jσ2

i + σ2

expe|ti−tj |/τexp,

(A1)

where σi is the diagonal matrix with the observational error bars that are usually provided in the processed data, and
σexp corresponds to the correlated noise with a time scale of τexp. We choose the amplitude of the ﬂuctuation in the
light curve to be σexp, and create the periodogram for the diﬀerent values of τexp. For each frequency, the normalized
power of the LS periodogram is calculated from (VanderPlas 2018)

z1(f ) = 1 −

ˆχ2(f )
ˆχ2
0

,

(A2)

where ˆχ2 is the minimum value of χ2(f ) = (y − ymodel)T C−1(y − ymodel), and y and ymodel are the time series of
the observation and model, respectively. In addition, ˆχ2
0 is a non-varying reference value. For each periodogram, we
scan the frequency between 1 day−1 < f < 100 day−1 and estimate FAP using the method of Delisle et al. (2020).
We can see that the LS periodogram of TESS data is insensitive to the time-correlated noise model within the current
framework.

Figure A1 shows the LS periodogram of the ZTF data with the time-correlated noise model for G141 (left panel) and
G205 (right panel). As we demonstrated in section 3.1, the possible periodic signal, fZF T ∼ 47 day−1, of G141 cannot
be conﬁrmed in the TESS/LOT data. From the left panel of Figure A1, we ﬁnd that the signal at fZF T ∼ 47 day−1
disappears from LS periodogram for τexp > 0.1 day. For G205 (right panel), on the other hand, the periodic signal
fZT F ∼ 24.6 day−1 is conﬁrmed in the TESS data, and the existence of the signal in the periodogram is insensitive to
the noise model. Although the noise model aﬀects the shape of the LS periodogram of the ZTF data, it is less eﬀective
in determining the existence of the periodic signal reported in Table 1. These results suggest that the periodic signal
fZF T ∼ 47 day−1 of G141 is likely related to the time-correlated noise.

Figure A2. Left : The LS-periodograms of ZTF data for the seven candidates listed in Table 1 with Gaussian and time
uncorrelated noise model [the ﬁrst term in Equation of (A1)]. The dashed and dotted lines are FAP=0.01 estimated by the
methods of Baluev (2008) and of the bootstrap, respectively. Right : The LS-periodograms with time correlated noise model [the
full expression of (A1)]. The results are for τexp = 1 day, and σexp = 1 mag, (for G131, G207, G205 and G216) or 0.5 magnitude
(for G453, G432 and G454). The dashed-dotted line represents FAP=0.01 estimated from the method of Delisle et al. (2020).

B. LS-PERIODOGRAMS AND FOLDED LIGHT CURVES OF ZTF AND TESS DATA

Figures B1 and B2 show LS-periodograms of the TESS data and folded light curves of ZTF/ TESS data for seven
candidates listed in Table 1. Figure B3 presents the LS-periodograms and folded light curves of TESS data for the
four candidates listed in Table 4.

C. INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL VARIABLE STAR INDEX AND VSNET-CHAT

While the article in press, we were noted that the candidates of the orbital periods for 4 sources in 7 candidates
listed in in Table 1 have been reported in the international Variable Star Index5 (VSX, for G205 and G432) and in
vsnet-chat (for G141 and G207). We summarize the information in VSX and vsnet-chat for 7 sources.

G141,4XMM J172959.0+522948 —This source is named as MGAB-V705 in VSX6 and the candidate of orbital period
∼ 0.0897008(1) day is reported in vsnet-chat 89237. This value is consistent with the value reported in Table 1.

G453, 1RXS J185013.9+242222 —As noted in main text, this source has been known as a dwarf nova by previous
observation of the outburst. This source is named as DDE 163 in VSX8

G207, 2SXPS J195230.9+372016 —This source is counterpart of ZTF 18abrxtii, which is listed in VSX9. The orbital
period ∼ 0.0699896(1) day, which is consistent with the value reported in Table 1, is mentioned in vsnet-chat 886610.

G205, 2SXPS J202600.8+333940 —This source is named as BMAM-V634 in VSX11, and the candidate of orbital period
∼0.0813141 day obtained from ZTF data (Chen et al. 2020) is consistent with our result.

G216, 2SXPS J211129.4+445923 —This source is counter part of ZTF 17aaapwae, which is listed in VSX12 as a variable
star.

G432, 2SXPS J192530.4+155424 —This source is named as DDE 182 in VSX13. The candidate of the orbital period
∼ 0.053903 day in the catalog is consistent with our result.
