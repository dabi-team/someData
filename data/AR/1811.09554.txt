ABSTRACT

A recent study using Hinode (SOT/FG) data of a sunspot revealed some unusually large penumbral
jets that often repeatedly occurred at the same locations in the penumbra, namely at the tail of a
penumbral ﬁlament or where the tails of multiple penumbral ﬁlaments converged. These locations
had obvious photospheric mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux in Na I 5896 Stokes-V images obtained with
SOT/FG. Several other recent investigations have found that extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/X-ray coronal
jets in quiet Sun regions (QRs), coronal holes (CHs) and near active regions (ARs) have obvious mixed-
polarity ﬂuxes at their base, and that magnetic ﬂux cancellation prepares and triggers a miniﬁlament
ﬂux-rope eruption that drives the jet. Typical QR, CH, and AR coronal jets are up to a hundred
times bigger than large penumbral jets, and in EUV/X-ray images show clear twisting motion in their
spires. Here, using IRIS Mg II k 2796 ˚A SJ images and spectra in the penumbrae of two sunspots
we characterize large penumbral jets. We ﬁnd redshift and blueshift next to each other across several
large penumbral jets, and interpret these as untwisting of the magnetic ﬁeld in the jet spire. Using
Hinode/SOT (FG and SP) data, we also ﬁnd mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux at the base of these jets.
Because large penumbral jets have mixed-polarity ﬁeld at their base and have twisting motion in their
spires, they might be driven the same way as QR, CH and AR coronal jets.

1. INTRODUCTION

Penumbral jets are small-scale transient events con-
tinuously occurring in sunspot penumbra, ﬁrst detected
by Katsukawa et al. (2007) in movies taken in the
chromospheric line Ca II H by Hinode (Solar Optical
Telescope/Filtergraph: SOT/FG, Kosugi et al. 2007;
Tsuneta et al. 2008; Ichimoto et al. 2008). These penum-
bral jets, also referred as microjets, are narrow (have a
width of less than 400 km), live less than a minute, and
have speeds of more than 100 km s−1 (Katsukawa et al.
2007). Penumbral jets are more clearly visible in the
limbward side of penumbra than the disk-center side

study, Tiwari et al. (2016) found penumbral jets that
were larger than microjets, and repeatedly occurred at
the tail of a penumbral ﬁlament (the “tail” is the part
of a ﬁlament that is farthest from the sunspot umbra)
or where the tails of several penumbral ﬁlaments ev-
idently converged. These jets were called as “large”
or “tail” penumbral jets. Large penumbral jets were
found to be much wider than microjets (up to 600 km
when measured using FWHM of a Gaussian ﬁt, or up
to 1500 km when measured directly from the intensity
enhancements as compared to the background i.e., us-
ing the Gaussian width), can have speeds of more than
200 km s−1, and live as long as or often longer than
microjets.

Penumbral microjets were originally proposed to form
due to component magnetic reconnection between two
inclined ﬁelds of the same magnetic polarity (Katsukawa

et al. 2007). Tiwari et al. (2016) proposed a modi-
ﬁed picture of formation of penumbral microjets based
on the recent observation of the internal structure of
penumbral ﬁlaments and spines. See Tiwari (2017) for
a recent review on sunspot structure. The penumbra is
formed entirely of “spines” and “ﬁlaments” (Tiwari et al.
2015). Spines (Lites et al. 1993; Title et al. 1993) are the
intrusions of umbral ﬁeld into the penumbra (in-between
penumbral ﬁlaments), and is thus nearly vertical ﬁeld,
the inclination of which with respect to vertical increases
with radial distance from the center of sunspots (Tiwari
et al. 2015). Penumbral ﬁlaments are elongated magne-
tized convective cells (Rempel 2012; Tiwari et al. 2013):
these have strong upﬂows (of ∼5 km s−1) near the bright
head (the “head” is the part of a ﬁlament that is near-
est to the sunspot umbra) with more nearly vertical and
strong ﬁeld (of 1.5 - 2 kG), and the upﬂow continues
along the central axis of the ﬁlament up to more than
half of its length, along the ﬁeld having strength ∼1 kG.
The tails of penumbral ﬁlaments contain strong down-
ﬂows (of ∼7 km s−1) and strong ﬁeld (of 2 - 3.5 kG);
they are dark in white light images and have opposite
polarity ﬁeld to that of heads.

In addition to the downﬂows in the ﬁlament tails, less-
intense downﬂows also occur along the edges of penum-
bral ﬁlaments, and the magnetic polarity along these
edges is often opposite to that of the head, the spine
or the umbra (see also, Joshi et al. 2011; Scharmer
et al. 2013; Ruiz Cobo & Asensio Ramos 2013; Este-
ban Pozuelo et al. 2015; Joshi et al. 2017). Observe
that, in this geometry, the ﬁeld in spines and the ﬁeld
in the sides of ﬁlaments are both in (i) close proximity
to each other and (ii) magnetically oriented in opposite
directions, and thus are prone to magnetic reconnection.
In the new picture presented by Tiwari et al. (2016),
penumbral microjets are produced by magnetic recon-
nection between the spine ﬁeld and the opposite-polarity
ﬁeld accompanied by the downﬂows in the sides of
penumbral ﬁlaments, and propagate along the spine
ﬁeld. This picture is in partial agreement with the
numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modelling of
Sakai & Smith (2008) and Magara (2010).

To validate the new picture of the formation mecha-
nism of penumbral microjets, proposed by Tiwari et al.
(2016), we need to establish one-to-one correspondence
of the locations of penumbral microjets in the chromo-
sphere to the photosphere, which is not trivial (Jurˇc´ak
& Katsukawa 2008; Tiwari et al. 2016). Advanced pro-
cessing techniques were used on diﬀerent ground and
space based data to detect the downﬂows and accom-
panying opposite-polarity magnetic ﬁeld in the sides of
penumbral ﬁlaments (Tiwari et al. 2013; van Noort et al.

2013; Ruiz Cobo & Asensio Ramos 2013; Scharmer et al.
2013; Joshi et al. 2017). Nonetheless, in a recent detailed
study, observational support for the new picture of the
formation mechanism of penumbral microjets has been
found by Esteban Pozuelo et al. (2018).

Large penumbral jets have obvious mixed-polarity
magnetic ﬁeld in the photosphere (Tiwari et al. 2016),
consistent with them being located at the tails of penum-
bral ﬁlaments, which have opposite polarity ﬁeld to that
of the spines, umbral or ﬁlament-head ﬁeld (Tiwari et al.
2013).
It was suggested by Tiwari et al. (2016) that
there might not be any fundamental diﬀerences in the
formation mechanisms of penumbral microjets and large
penumbral jets – both form due to magnetic reconnec-
tion in the (higher) photosphere leading to a ﬂux cancel-
lation at the base. The only diﬀerences might lie in their
sizes and contents of magnetic ﬂux at their bases – large
penumbral jets have larger amount of opposite-polarity
ﬂux, thus, larger jets are produced repeatedly until the
opposite-polarity ﬂux is completely cancelled, whereas
the opposite-polarity ﬁeld at the base of microjets, in
the sides of ﬁlaments, is quite narrow and small, and is
rarely visible (Tiwari et al. 2013).

Tiwari et al. (2016) found clear signatures of large
penumbral jets in the transition region (using AIA 1600,
171, 193 ˚A data), consistent with the results of Vissers
et al. (2015), who found transition region signatures of
microjets using IRIS data. Because Vissers et al. (2015)
did not diﬀerentiate between microjets and large penum-
bral jets, we suspect that they probably only studied the
largest of microjets, or perhaps some large penumbral
jets. But even the largest of the penumbral jets studied
by Tiwari et al. (2016) never showed up in the corona
(i.e., in AIA 94 ˚A images), thus whether they have any
direct contribution to coronal heating above sunspots
remains unknown.

Solar coronal jets at much larger scales (a hundred
times bigger) than large penumbral jets have been ex-
tensively studied in coronal holes (CHs), quiet regions
(QRs), and near active regions (ARs), both observa-
tionally and by numerical modelling (e.g., Shibata et al.
1992; Cirtain et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2010; Schmieder
et al. 2013; Pariat et al. 2015; Sterling et al. 2015; Che-
ung et al. 2015). These coronal jets have been found
to have helical or twisting motions in their spires, and
to occur at the locations of mixed-polarity ﬁeld in the
photosphere, often with ﬂux cancellation (Patsourakos
et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Schmieder et al. 2013; Moore
et al. 2015; Cheung et al. 2015; Panesar et al. 2016a,b;
Sterling et al. 2017; Panesar et al. 2018a).

Because large penumbral jets have been found to have
mixed-polarity ﬁeld at their base in the photosphere, in

the present work, we focus on searching for any evidence
of twisting in them, which would suggest similarities in
the origin of penumbral jets and coronal jets. Jets in
CHs, QRs and ARs are much bigger, thus, twisting in
them is often clearly discernible in EUV intensity im-
ages. However, large penumbral jets are much smaller
and it is not possible to detect twisting in direct inten-
sity images. We therefore use IRIS Mg II spectra to
search for possible blueshifts and redshifts compatible
with twisting in large penumbral jets. We also verify
the presence of mixed-polarity magnetic ﬁeld at their
base (and calculate ﬂux cancellation rates), whenever
the magnetic ﬁeld data permits.

2. DATA AND METHODS

We have selected two sunspots, both near solar disk
center, whose penumbrae were observed nearly simulta-
neously by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS: De Pontieu et al. 2014a), and the Solar Optical
Telescope (SOT: Tsuneta et al. 2008; Ichimoto et al.
2008; Suematsu et al. 2008; Shimizu et al. 2008; Lites
et al. 2013) onboard Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007). From
IRIS, we mainly focus on the Mg II line because its for-
mation can be considered nearest to that of the Ca II
line in which penumbral jets were ﬁrst detected by Kat-
sukawa et al. (2007).

Both sunspots in our study were observed by Hin-
ode (SOT): the ﬁrst one by the ﬁltergraph (FG) and
the second one by the spectropolarimeter (SP). The FG
data are from the magnetically sensitive Na I 5896 line,
and Stokes-V/I images are recorded. The SP repeat-
edly scanned about half of the penumbra of the second
sunspot (in 6301.5 and 6302.5 ˚A) in normal scan mode,
thus, having full Stokes (I, Q, U, and V) data with a
pixel size of 0.16 arcsec and a noise level of 10−3 Ic
(Ichimoto et al. 2008; Lites et al. 2013).

The FG G-band images have a pixel size of 0.22 arc-
sec, and the Na I 5896 Stokes-V/I images have a pixel
size of 0.32 arcsec. Because of a stationary bubble in
the tunable ﬁlter there is some blurring in parts of the
image, degrading the resolution and hindering detection
of mixed-polarity ﬁeld in Stokes-V/I images.

For the ﬁrst sunspot (the leading part of NOAA AR
12394) on 05 August 2015, during 11:09:21–16:06:17 UT,
IRIS ran a large coarse 8-step raster with a step cadence
of 9 s, and a raster cadence of 73 s, thus resulting in a
total of 245 rasters (OBS ID 3860109380). The exposure
time for each slit position was 8 s. Slit-jaw images in two
channels, C II 1330 ˚A and Mg II 2796 ˚A, at every 18 s
were recorded and have a pixel size of 0.33 arcsec. The
IRIS slit width is 0.33 arcsec. The spectra have a slit
step size of 2 arcsec and a pixel size of 0.33 arcsec in

the vertical (Y-) direction, due to a binning in the Y-
direction by a factor of two.

from ‘2017-09-15T23:04:42.570’

The second sunspot penumbra (the leading part
of NOAA AR 12680) was observed in September,
2017,
to ‘2017-09-
16T03:52:25.510’ (OBS ID 3624258055). IRIS scanned
medium dense 64-step rasters with the slit step size of
0.35 arcsec and the y-pixel size of 0.16 arcsec. The step
cadence is 9 s and the raster cadence is 595 s, thus, re-
sulting in 29 rasters in about ﬁve hours of observations.
The exposure time for each slit position, also for this
sunspot, is 8 s. The IRIS slit-jaw images in each of the
four IRIS channels are recorded at a cadence of 37 s and
have a pixel size of 0.16 arcsec.

All IRIS data were already calibrated to level 2, i.e.,
dark-current subtracted, ﬂat-ﬁelded, corrected for geo-
metrical distortion and wavelength calibrated.

FG data were not available during this time of obser-
vation for the second sunspot, but SP observations are
available, at a 7.5 minute cadence. SP scanned a part
of the sunspot penumbra multiple times from ‘2017-09-
15T22:48:06.937’ to ‘2017-09-16T05:48:06.531’. To align
Stokes-V scans with the IRIS Mg II images, we ﬁrst
align IRIS slit-jaw continuum intensity images of the
Mg II k line in the far red wing (2832 ˚A) (which provides
high-contrast photospheric imaging) with the continuum
intensity/G-band images obtained by SOT/SP/FG. The
FG and SP data were calibrated using FG PREP and
SP PREP routines, respectively, see Lites & Ichimoto
(2013) for details.

Due to their transient nature penumbral jets are of-
ten most clearly detected in running diﬀerence images.
Therefore we use running diﬀerence slit-jaw images to
calculate diﬀerent properties of jets, listed in Tables 1
and 2. However, depending on the timings of the image
frames involved in creating running diﬀerence images,
due to the limited slit-jaw image cadence, sometimes
jets are not best seen in running diﬀerence images. In
those cases we have used direct intensity Mg II slit-jaw
images to estimate those numbers characterizing jets.

We analyze the IRIS rasters for the Mg II k 2796 ˚A line
and create Dopplergrams by subtracting the intensities
in the blueshifted and redshifted wings of the spectral
line at ﬁxed oﬀset velocities from the rest wavelengths
e.g., in our case for better visibility of both blueshifts
and redshifts we choose ±50 km s−1 (De Pontieu et al.
2014b). To reduce any local ﬂuctuations in the Dopp-
lergrams, we averaged Dopplergrams created by inte-
grating the signal over a range of 10 km s−1 centered
around ±50 km s−1. The Dopplergrams for Mg II 2796
k line plasma provide structure and dynamics (redshift
and blueshift) of chromospheric plasma.

3. RESULTS

We created Dopplergrams of IRIS spectral rasters of
both sunspots for the Mg II k line, in which penumbral
jets are best seen. As mentioned earlier, Dopplergrams
are intensity diﬀerences at ﬁxed oﬀsets (here it is ±50
km s−1) in blue and red wings. We aim to detect any
signatures of blueshift and redshift next to each other
along the slit at the location where the slit cuts across
the jet. If the ﬁeld in the spire of large penumbral jets is
twisting, there should be signatures of it in the spectral
proﬁles and in Dopplergrams.

3.1. Sunspot penumbra from the leading spot of NOAA

AR 12394

We show in Figure 1 the full sunspot and the FOV
selected for our investigation. Note that we selected only
the northern part of the penumbra to avoid viewing the
activity in the light bridge present in the southern part
of the sunspot.

In Figure 2, we show an example large penumbral jet
in a Mg II k line slit-jaw image, and a running diﬀerence
image during the peak time of the jet. The respective

Dopplergram and spectra are displayed in panels (c) and
(d), respectively. Panels (a) and (b) are a frame from the
movie SJ Pen1.mp4, and panel (c) is a frame from the
movie Doppler Pen1.mp4. During the peak of the jet
the IRIS slit crossed the middle of the jet at an angle of
∼ 30◦ to the jet’s long dimension. In the Dopplergram,
there is a clear blueshift and redshift pattern next to
each other, along the slit, when the slit was located in
the middle of the jet during the jet’s peak time. We in-
terpret these ﬂows as the signature of twisting motion of
the magnetic ﬁeld in the spire of the large penumbral jet.
Consistent with the Dopplergram, the spectral proﬁles
at this time show obvious shifts towards the blue/red
wing of the line at respective pixels, shown in panel (d).
In Figure 3, we plot spectral proﬁles for a blueshifted
and a redshifted pixel during, before, and after the
event, along the fourth slit of raster number 241. Con-
sistent with Figure 2, a clear blueshift and redshift in
blue and red wings, respectively, are seen during the
event time as compared to the proﬁles before and after
the event. No signiﬁcant shift is seen at the line cen-
ter k3 during the peak event time with respect to the
quieter times. This might suggest that the k3 is formed
in the background atmosphere and not inside of large

middle of the jet during the jet’s peak time. (a) Mg II 2796 ˚A slit-jaw image. (b) Running diﬀerence image. The jet is outlined
by an oval shaped blue circle. Note that a part of the jet is obscured by the slit. An animation for panels (a) and (b) is available,
see “SJ Pen1.mp4”: each jet listed in Table 1 is marked in the movie by a red arrow during its peak-visibility time, with the
arrow also displayed in the nearest earlier and nearest later frames to help viewer focus on the location of the jet. (c) The
Dopplergram shows that the opposite sides of the jet have opposite (red/blue) Doppler shifts. Of the 8-slits of the 241st raster
the fourth slit caught this event. The time noted on the Dopplergram image is of the ﬁrst slit of the 8-step raster. An animation
of panel (c) is available, see “Doppler Pen1.mp4”. Jets in the Dopplergram movie are marked by white arrows. Similar to that
in the slit-jaw movie each jet location in the Dopplergram movie is marked by an arrow in three consecutive frames, the middle
frame corresponding to the peak-visibility time. In panel (d) spectra along the slit are displayed.

penumbral jets. The same is also true for the k2v and
k2r peaks.

A dominant 6 – 8 km s−1 redshift visible in the Figure
3 could be due to the inverse Evershed ﬂow (Evershed
1909). All over the penumbra such chromospheric down-
ﬂows ranging 2 – 10 km s−1 are present.

In Figure 5, we show an FG Stokes-V image in Na I
5869 ˚A line of the same FOV as IRIS. Note that the
magnetogram is blurred by a stationary bubble in the
tunable ﬁlter. Therefore in the right panel of the Figure
we augment the small FOV of interest that covers the
base of the large penumbral jet displayed in Figure 2.
The presence of mixed-polarity ﬁeld is obvious at the
base of the example large penumbral jet. This location
is also apparently where the tails of several penumbral
ﬁlaments converge.

Because of the coarseness of the IRIS rasters (2 arc-
sec steps) the probability of catching a penumbral jet
with the IRIS slit is small. Nonetheless, over the period
of our observations we did catch ﬁve additional large

penumbral jets by the IRIS slit in this sunspot penum-
bra. These jets displayed clear signature in Doppler-
grams and are listed in Table 1.

Each jet listed in Table 1 is marked by a red arrow
in the slit-jaw movie (SJ Pen1.mp4) and by a white ar-
row in the Dopplergram movie (Doppler Pen1.mp4) dur-
ing their peak-visibility time. To help viewers focus on
the locations of large penumbral jets in the slit-jaw and
Dopplergram movies, we have also added an arrow for
each large penumbral jet in the frames just before and
just after the peak-visibility time. The peak-visibility
times of these jets, with their estimated lengths, widths
(e.g., Figure 4),
lifetimes (calculated from the movie
SJ Pen1.mp4), speeds (calculated from their lengths
and lifetimes, also veriﬁed with time-distance method)
and whether they have blueshift/redshift in Doppler-
grams and have mixed-polarity ﬁeld at their base mag-
netograms, are also listed in the Table 1. FG data was
available only for the last two jets, listed in Table 1.

aLengths and widths calculated from direct intensity enhancements with respect to their background might have an uncertainty
of one to two pixels, i.e., up to 480 km.
b Uncertainty in the estimated lifetimes is less than two frames, i.e., less than 37 s.
c Based on the estimated uncertainties for lengths and lifetimes of large penumbral jets, the uncertainty in the estimated speeds
can be up to 13 km s−1. The speeds are calculated from the length and the lifetime of each of the jets. We also veriﬁed these
numbers from the speeds derived from time-distance measurements. Note that the given speed might well be diﬀerent/lower
from the actual speeds due to projection eﬀects.
dFG Stokes-V image is blurred, similar to the one shown in Figure 5.
Note— The displayed time for a penumbral jet in the slit-jaw movie (SJ Pen1.mp4) and in the Dopplergram movie
(Doppler Pen1.mp4) can be diﬀerent, as evident from the ﬁrst column in the table, because the time shown in the Dopp-
lergram movie is the time of the 1st slit position for each raster. Width and length are measured at the peak-visibility time of
the jet, which might or might not be the time of the slit position on the jet. Due to foreshortening the listed values of lengths
and speeds of the jets are their lower limits.

periphery by the slit. A few of the strong events do not
have any signatures in the Dopplergrams. We have not
included those jets in the table.

3.2. Sunspot penumbra from the leading spot of NOAA

AR 12680

In the same way as for the ﬁrst sunspot we created
Dopplergrams for this sunspot penumbra. A context
image of the sunspot is shown in Figure 6. The IRIS
raster for this sunspot penumbra is 64-step, a medium
dense raster, thus, although the raster cadence is worse,
the dense coverage leads to better spatial coverage along
penumbral jets.
In Figure 7, we display one example
large penumbral jet, see panels (a) and (b) (and movie:
SJ Pen2.mp4).
In panel (c) we plot the Dopplergram
(see movie: Doppler Pen2.mp4), and the location of the
jet is outlined with an oval. Blueshifted and redshifted
pixels next to each other across the slit can be clearly
noticed at the jet location. Because the slit was on the
jet for several consecutive steps a clear extension of the
blueshift/redshift along the jet can be noticed.

In panel (d) of Figure 7, the spectra along the slit at
one of these times (when the slit crossed the jet) are
plotted. Blueshift and redshift (line-wing broadening in
the blueshifted and redshifted pixels) are consistent with
the blueshift/redshift observed in the Dopplergram in
panel (c). We again interpret the blueshift and redshift
present next to each other across the large penumbral
jet as twisting/untwisting of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
spire of the jet.

In Figure 8, we display the line proﬁles of two pixels
across the slit – one blueshifted, one redshifted. There
are obvious blueshift and redshift present in the respec-
tive line proﬁle wings. It is important to note that al-
though there is excessive blueshift and redshift in the
pixels of corresponding proﬁles, there is a strong broad-
ening present in the line during the event. Possible ex-
planations for the strong line broadening are unresolved
motions, e.g., from turbulence, or increased opacity be-
cause of heating (due to increased temperature and den-
sity). In either case, the excessive shifts in the blue and
red wings indicate that there is twisting motion of the
magnetic ﬁeld lines that channel the jet plasma.

We looked at the base of this jet in Stokes-V maps
from the SP observations. Two image frames of the
sunspot penumbra scanned before and after the jet are
plotted in Figure 10. Clear locations of positive (mi-
nority) polarity ﬂux can be noticed just before the jet
event, and the ﬁeld disappears after the jet is over. This
is consistent with ﬂux cancellation being involved in the

Figure 4. Width and length measurements of the example
large penumbral jet shown in Figure 2. (a) Running diﬀer-
ence image with a red/black cut across width/length of the
jet. The intensity plots along these cuts (diamonds – width;
triangles – length), with their ﬁtted Gaussian (solid lines),
are shown in panel (b). The data ﬁts the Gaussian accept-
ably well. Both the width and length directly estimated from
the intensity enhancements with respect to the background
(i.e., from the Gaussian width) and by FWHM of the Gaus-
sian ﬁtted function are printed, and are also listed in Table
1. During the peak of the jet the IRIS slit was centered on
the middle of the jet, partially obscuring the jet and thereby
complicating the measurements. Thus, we measured the jet
width and length in the nearest earlier frame of the IRIS
data.

Due to the raster scan being coarse and jets being
transient, often only a part of a jet (e.g., only head
or only tail) is caught by the IRIS slit. Moreover,
the slit often did not cross the jets during their peak
times. These factors might be why some jets show only
blueshift or only redshift. Some of the large penum-
bral jets reoccur at the same locations for several min-
utes, thus, share some properties of Ellerman bombs
(Ellerman 1917; Rutten et al. 2013). However, Ellerman
bombs are mostly found outside sunspots (not inside the
sunspot penumbra); see Section 4 for a discussion on the
similarities and diﬀerences between Ellerman bombs and

large penumbral jets, and by Panesar et al. (2017, 2018a)
for EUV and X-ray coronal jets.

It is important to note that the example jet shown
in Figure 7 is a coupled jet (there are two jets occur-
ring closely enough to appear as one). The tails of
two penumbral ﬁlaments (with positive polarity mag-

netic ﬁeld) involved in the jets are seen inside the oval
outlined in the Figure 10 of Stokes-V images.

A dominant overall general downﬂow ranging 2 to 10
km s−1 is found also in this sunspot penumbra, which
again can be attributed to the chromospheric inverse
Evershed ﬂow (Evershed 1909).

aLengths and widths calculated from direct intensity enhancements might have an uncertainty of one to two pixels, i.e., up to 240 km.
b Uncertainty in the estimated lifetimes is less than two frames, i.e., less than 75 s.
c Based on the estimated uncertainties for lengths and lifetimes of large penumbral jets, uncertainty in the estimated speeds can be up to
4 km s−1. Similar to that in Table 1, the speeds are calculated from the length and the lifetime of each of the jets. We also veriﬁed these
numbers from the speeds derived from time-distance measurements. The given speeds might be diﬀerent/lower from the actual speeds
due to projection eﬀects.

dtwisting is ambiguous in this case.
e a few SP slits are missing at the jet base.
f The uncertainty in the estimated cancellation rates is on the order of a factor of two to three.
Note—The displayed time for a penumbral jet in the slit-jaw movie (SJ Pen2.mp4) and in the Dopplergram movie (Doppler Pen2.mp4)
can be diﬀerent, as evident from the ﬁrst column in the table, because the time shown in the Dopplergram movie is the time of the 1st
slit position for each raster. Due to foreshortening the listed values of lengths and speeds of the jets are their lower limits. In a few
cases when positive polarity magnetic ﬂux (at the tails of penumbral ﬁlaments) can be clearly separated and ﬂux cancellation is clearly
visible, ﬂux cancellation rates are estimated from Bz derived from the ME inversions of the SP data at CSAC/HAO.

Ten other large penumbral jets in this sunspot penum-
bra, with their diﬀerent properties i.e., lengths, widths
(see, Figure 9),
lifetimes (calculated from the movie
SJ Pen2.mp4), speeds (calculated from lengths and
lifetimes, also veriﬁed with time-distance method),
Dopplergram features, and mixed-polarity ﬁeld in their
SP Stokes-V images, are listed in Table 2. These
jets are also marked by red and white arrows in the
movies SJ Pen2.mp4 and Doppler Pen2.mp4, respec-
tively. Similar to the slit-jaw and Dopplergram movies
in the ﬁrst sunspot penumbra, also for the second
sunspot penumbra (in the movies SJ Pen2.mp4 and
Doppler Pen2.mp4) we point to each large penumbral
jet listed in Table 2 by arrows in three frames: one

during the peak-visibility time (given in Table 2), and
one each in the frames just before and just after the
peak-visibility time.

Evidently, there are several jets displaying only mostly
blueshift or only mostly redshift (e.g., the one at
01:03:46 UT in the movie Doppler Pen2.mp4,
listed
in Table 2). Among other factors, the dominant ﬂows
of one sign could be because of one sign of the shift
dominating over the other, the location of the slit (it
covering only red or only blueshifted part of a jet; it not
being perpendicular to the jet), or the jets themselves
having no twisting/untwisting motions. One explana-
tion for the dominance of one Doppler sign over the
other, even in the presence of twisting, is that there are

12

Tiwari et al.

vious mixed polarity magnetic ﬂux – moving magnetic
bipolar features. We found evidence of twist in Doppler-
grams in these jets as well. These jets could be consid-
ered closer to (large) AR coronal jets (e.g., Sterling et al.
2016), although these jets at the periphery of sunspots
are still at much smaller scales than AR coronal jets. A
detailed investigation of these jets emanating from mov-
ing magnetic features will be performed in a separate
research work.

In a movie SP StokesV.mp4, we have marked by white
circles the locations of each large penumbral jet listed in
Table 2. Note that the Stokes-V movie has only eleven
frames, one for each example large penumbral jet. Each
frame contains two maps of the penumbra, one scanned
slightly before and the other slightly after the respective
jet’s peak time.

From the Milne-Eddington (ME) inversions of SP
maps of the second sunspot, we could calculate ﬂux can-
cellation rate in four of our large penumbral jets, which
turns out to be, on average, of the order of 1018 Mx
h−1. Note that it is not possible to always isolate the
desired magnetic ﬂux polarity from the complex sur-
rounding in the sunspot penumbra for calculating the
rate of ﬂux cancellation involved in a penumbral jet for-
mation. Further, sometimes the amount of magnetic
ﬁeld is too small to be detected at given pixels due to
the noise and other artifacts in the non-converging ME
inversions. Finally, due to the limited cadence of our SP
data (7.5 minutes) the ﬂux cancellation rate can not be
accurately estimated.

4. DISCUSSION

We investigated two sunspot penumbrae, each ob-
served simultaneously by IRIS and Hinode, to ﬁnd out
whether large penumbral jets have twisting motions, and
whether the jets always have mixed-polarity magnetic
ﬁeld at their base. Note that the selected sunspots were
close to the solar disk center and therefore the visibility
of the jets is not optimal, due to foreshortening. But
the magnetograms do not have much projection eﬀect
for that very reason (e.g., Falconer et al. 2016).

We ﬁnd for large penumbral jets an average length of
3000 km, an average width of 1350 km, an average life-
time of 95 s, and an average speed of 35 km s−1. Some of
these numbers fall on the longest end of the range pro-
vided by Drews & Rouppe van der Voort (2017), who did
not diﬀerentiate between microjets and large penumbral
jets. The speeds of large penumbral jets in our sam-
ple are much smaller than that obtained for diﬀerent
penumbral jets by Katsukawa et al. (2007) and Tiwari
et al. (2016). This is likely due to the foreshortening
(projection eﬀect) due to our sunspots being located on

Figure 10. SP Stokes-V images (qualitatively equivalent to
magnetograms) displaying the base of the large penumbral
jet shown in Figure 7. The magnetic ﬁeld is given in arbitrary
units, ranging ±1, i.e, the displayed ﬁeld is symmetric about
zero. The blue oval shape is centered on the base of the jet.
The two panels (a) and (b) show Stokes-V scans starting
before and just after the jet event. The time given on the
bottom of each panel belongs to the ﬁrst spectral slit of the
SP scan of the given FOV of the sunspot penumbra. An

frames for each jet listed in Table 2.

several diﬀerent types of motions including ﬁeld-aligned
ﬂows, which can oﬀset the Dopplergrams to one color
(De Pontieu et al. 2012, 2014b).

Although the running diﬀerence images show the jets
better due to jet’s transient nature, these do not al-
ways enhance the jets due to the limited cadence of our
data. Therefore a few times while we see penumbral
jets clearly in Mg II slit-jaw images, we do not see those
jets in the running diﬀerence images so clearly. In those
cases Mg II slit-jaw intensity images, rather than their
running diﬀerence images, are used for estimating the
relevant numbers listed in Table 2.

We also found several similar large jets forming just
outside the sunspot penumbra, at the locations of ob-

the disk center. A part of the diﬀerence might also be
due to the fact that diﬀerent chromospheric lines were
used in these studies (Ca II H line is used in the most
earlier studies, whereas Mg II k line is used here).

For some time now it has been observed that many
QR, CH and AR coronal jets show twisting/untwisting
motions, and that they have mixed-polarity magnetic
ﬁeld at their base. That mixed-polarity magnetic ﬂux
often progressively cancels before and through the time
of coronal jet-onset, with recently reported ﬂux cancel-
lation rate of 1018 Mx h−1 for CHs and QR jets (Panesar
et al. 2016b, 2017, 2018a,b). AR jets have higher ﬂux
cancellation rate by an order of magnitude, however,
with increased uncertainty in its measurement (Sterling
et al. 2017). We made a crude estimate of the ﬂux can-
cellation rate in a few of our large penumbral jets, and
ﬁnd, consistently, the values of the order of 1018 Mx h−1.
It must be noted that, for each jet, we have calcu-
lated ﬂux cancellation rates based on two SP scans of
the penumbra, one starting slightly before the jet and
the other starting slightly after the jet, separated by 7.5
minute. Unless a ﬁlament is decaying, the downﬂows at
the tails keep enhancing magnetic ﬁeld there. Even if
there is a decrease in the amount of magnetic ﬁeld at
the tails of penumbral ﬁlaments during a large penum-
bral jet, exact ﬂux content involved in driving the jet is
extremely diﬃcult to accurately estimate. Moreover, be-
cause of the complex magnetic topology of the penumbra
with several small-scale magnetic structures present in
it (see, e.g., Tiwari 2017, and reference therein), the ob-
served Stokes proﬁles are often quite asymmetric, there-
fore ME inversion does not necessarily provide the most
reliable results. Further, the cadence of the observations
is not good enough to attribute the measured ﬂux can-
cellation exclusively to large penumbral jets. Clearly a
faster cadence of spectropolarimetric observations with
more sophisticated inversions (see, e.g., del Toro Iniesta
& Ruiz Cobo 2016) are needed to access accurate ﬂux
cancellation rates for penumbral jets.

By using Mg II spectra for the two sunspot penumbrae
in our study, observed with IRIS, we ﬁnd that several
large penumbral jets display blueshift and redshift, per-
pendicular to the jet direction, next to each other along
the IRIS slit. This suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld in
the spire of large penumbral jets is twisting/untwisting.
Because large penumbral jets have mixed-polarity ﬁeld
(see Tiwari et al. 2016, and this study), the ﬁnding that
they twist suggests that large penumbral jets might form
the same way as QR, CH and AR coronal jets do. Note
that, alternatively, propagating Alf´ven waves that are
generated in some other way might produce untwisting
in the jet-spire of large penumbral jets.

Penumbral microjets are proposed to form in a simi-
lar way as large penumbral jets, by reconnection in the
lower atmosphere (higher photosphere) (Tiwari et al.
2016). However, due to their small sizes and transient
nature (short lifetime), a one to one correspondence be-
tween (chromospheric) microjets and magnetic features
in the photosphere has not been established (Jurˇc´ak &
Katsukawa 2008; Tiwari et al. 2016). Nonetheless, in
a recent study, Esteban Pozuelo et al. (2018) could re-
late a number of penumbral microjets with the photo-
spheric mixed-polarity ﬁeld in the sides of penumbral
ﬁlaments. Whether microjets are too narrow to display
signatures of twisting with the current instrumentation
(e.g., whether the SST data, which have higher spa-
tial resolution than IRIS, show twisting motions in mi-
crojets) should be investigated. Therefore, whether all
jets in sunspot penumbrae show twisting motions and
whether all of them form in the same way remains to be
seen.

If large penumbral jets form the same way as coronal
jets in QRs, CHs and ARs, then these could form in the
way described by the sketch in Figure 11. Note that
the sketch describes left-handed untwisting of a large
penumbral jet. A similar setup with the internal recon-
nection starting on the other side (compared to Figure
11) of the tail, than shown in Figure 11, will result in a
penumbral jet with right-handed untwisting.

If the IRIS slit was placed along the jet then one could
argue that the observed blueshift and redshift represent
outﬂow from a reconnection site, situated in between, as
proposed by Katsukawa et al. (2007). However, because
we are looking at penumbral jets observed at a large an-
gle to the IRIS slit, the observed blueshifts and redshifts
are most probably representative of twisting motion of
the magnetic ﬁeld and plasma therein.

Although we ﬁnd clear signatures of twisting motion
of the ﬁeld in the spire of several large penumbral jets,
not all penumbral jets display clear signature of twisting.
Some of them have only redshift or only blueshift across
them, thus, indicating some large penumbral jets might
not twist. However, it is possible that we do not detect
the other component, it being relatively very weak. De
Pontieu et al. (2014b) have shown that swaying motions
or ﬁeld-aligned ﬂows of modest size can make one side
of the twist disappear (see also, De Pontieu et al. 2012).
The visibility of twisting in large penumbral jets also
depends on which part (head, middle, tail) and phase
(beginning, peak, decay) of the jet was covered by the
IRIS slit. Evidently denser IRIS scans (e.g.,
in the
second sunspot penumbra in our study, see Table 2)
increase the possibility of detecting twisting in large
penumbral jets. Large penumbral jets seem to have a

Coronal jets (in CHs, QRs and ARs) untwist resulting from the eruption of a magnetic arcade whose core is greatly sheared
and twisted and becomes a growing twisted ﬂux rope as it erupts. Each drawing sketches the magnetic ﬁeld in – or the ﬁeld’s
projection onto – a slanted cross-cut plane through the tail of a penumbral ﬁlament in which the ﬁeld direction is downward into
the plane. The cross-cut plane slants away from the viewer, away from the head of the penumbral ﬁlament, so that lines of spine
ﬁeld surrounding the penumbral ﬁlament lie in the plane. The thick black line at the base of each drawing is some level low in
the penumbral photosphere. The plus and minus signs give the polarity of the magnetic ﬂux through that level. Blue lines are
ﬁeld lines that have not yet undergone reconnection in the eruption; red lines are ﬁeld lines that have undergone reconnection in
the eruption. Drawing (a) shows the direction and form of the ﬁeld prior to the jet-eruption onset. The spine ﬁeld has positive
polarity and the ﬁeld in the tail of the penumbral ﬁlament has negative polarity. Prior, convectively slowly-driven, evolutionary
reconnection has built a sheared-core arcade over the polarity inversion line on each side of the tail, between the tail ﬁeld and
spine ﬁeld. Due to the direction of the shear of the tail ﬁeld relative to the surrounding spine ﬁeld, the evolutionary reconnection
has given the sheared-core arcade on the tail’s left side right-handed shear and twist, and has given the arcade on the right
side left-handed shear and twist. In the time between drawings (a) and (b), convection-driven ﬂux-cancellation tether-cutting
reconnection at the polarity inversion line of the left-side sheared-core arcade triggers the eruption of that arcade. Drawing (b)
shows the envelop of the erupting arcade undergoing interchange reconnection with the encountered spine ﬁeld, and shows the
legs of the erupting arcade undergoing internal tether-cutting reconnection. Red Xs mark reconnection sites and black arrows
represent magnetically-driven plasma outﬂows from the reconnection sites. Drawing (c) shows the interchange reconnection
eating into the twisted-ﬂux-rope core of the erupting arcade to open that twisted closed ﬁeld. Drawing (d) shows the twist
escaping and untwisting out along the newly opened ﬁeld in the jet. Because the twist given to the open ﬁeld is right-handed in
this case, the spin direction of the untwisting in this large penumbral jet is left-handed, clockwise viewed facing the jet outﬂow
direction.

tendency of having stronger/dominant blueshift in the
early phase and redshift in their last phase. This agrees
with the idea presented in Figure 11. However some ex-
ceptions to this picture can be noticed in the two tables
(see Tables 1 and 2).

The visibility of only redshift or only blueshift across
large penumbral jets might also depend on whether or
not they are made by the eruption of a small-scale ﬂux
rope. Several recent studies on coronal jets in QRs, CHs
and ARs have found that these have cool materials in
them, in ﬂux ropes, and are a result of miniﬁlament
eruptions (Sterling et al. 2015; Panesar et al. 2016b,
2017; Sterling et al. 2016, 2017; Panesar et al. 2018a).
Due to much smaller sizes of penumbral jets, as com-
pared to jets in QRs, CHs and ARs, whether there is an
erupting “microﬁlament” (e.g., Sterling & Moore 2016)
in these jets can not be seen. Moreover, although they
display clear twisting in EUV images, smaller jets in
CHs and QRs – jetlets – do not show any signatures of
miniﬁlament/cool materials inside them (Panesar et al.
2018b). Whether large penumbral jets come from a mi-
croﬁlament eruption remains to be seen.

We are also not aware at this point if the visibility
of blueshift/redshift in large penumbral jets varies from
one sunspot penumbra to other sunspot penumbra, de-
pending on their age, and activity level. The present
work is the ﬁrst report on the twisting motions of the
magnetic ﬁeld in large penumbral jets, and a more ex-
tensive work, both from observations and MHD simula-
tions, is needed to supplement the ﬁndings in this paper.
If penumbral jets form the way proposed by either
Katsukawa et al. (2007) or Tiwari et al. (2016), they
may or may not twist, depending on the orientation and
conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld involved in the recon-
nection. If Alfv´en waves are generated during magnetic
reconnection driving a penumbral jet, one could expect
to see twisting motions in the jet spire. Similarly, if
large penumbral jets form the way jets in QRs, CHs or
ARs do, by eruption of a miniﬁlament ﬂux rope, then
we expect that they untwist/twist during the eruption.
The fact that many of the large penumbral jets show
twisting and many do not suggests that both types of
mechanisms (convection-driven magnetic reconnection,
and small-scale ﬂux-rope eruption) could be at work in
diﬀerent penumbral jets. Further, we cannot rule out
the possibility that the observed twisting in jet spires is
caused by the propagation of Alfv´en waves generated by
convection-driven magnetic reconnection.

Esteban Pozuelo et al. (2018) found weak line-of-sight
(LOS) velocities (<5 km s−1) inside penumbral micro-
jets using Ca II data. Thus, penumbral jets might ac-
tually not be a site of strong ﬁeld-aligned ﬂows, but of

modest ﬂows.
In that case the fast apparent motion
of penumbral jets could be caused by a heating front
(generated by magnetic reconnection at photospheric
heights) moving much faster than the actual mass ﬂow.
This interpretation is similar to that of De Pontieu et al.
(2017) for network jets, which have much larger propa-
gation speeds than Doppler shifts, and are proposed to
be caused by heating fronts. Similar to large penumbral
jets, network jets also show blue/red shifts, which are
thought to be associated with twisting motions.

In the Dopplergram movies of both sunspot penum-
brae there are some additional noticeable transient sig-
nals that somewhat resemble those that we have identi-
ﬁed as large penumbral jets. For example in the movie
Doppler Pen1.mp4 the raster starting at 15:02:03 UT
displays a clear blueshift in two pixels (and a weak red-
shift in the next pixel down to the blueshifted pixels)
along the ﬁrst slit position, but no obvious jet-like ac-
tivity in the corresponding slit-jaw (and the running dif-
ference) frames can be seen in the movie SJ Pen1.mp4.
Because we do not ﬁnd any jet-like activity in the slit-
jaw images corresponding to some Doppler signals these
Doppler signals could probably be related to a diﬀerent
type of activity, and not to large penumbral jets. We
have ignored these Doppler signals in our present inves-
tigation.

Some locations of large penumbral jets remain bright
for several minutes, displaying Ellerman bomb like sig-
natures (e.g., Rutten et al. 2013). Whether large penum-
bral jets have any connection with Ellerman bombs re-
mains to be seen. The most obvious similarities between
Ellerman bombs and large penumbral jets are: (1) both
show enhancements conﬁned to the wings of the line
proﬁles (c.f. Reardon et al. 2013, and this study), (2)
both show blue/red Doppler signal (often both) at their
bases (c.f. Watanabe et al. 2011, and this study), and
(3) large penumbral jets and Ellerman bombs both form
in the (higher) photosphere (Rutten et al. 2013; Tiwari
et al. 2016). The most obvious diﬀerences are: (1) Eller-
man bombs are often found outside sunspots, whereas
penumbral jets form inside the sunspot penumbra, (2)
the average lifetime of 96 s of large penumbral jets, found
in the present study, is much shorter than the lifetime
of Ellerman bombs (average 566 s, c.f. Watanabe et al.
2011), (3) the extent/length of jets from Ellerman bomb
locations are on average three times smaller than that
of large penumbral jets, (4) the average extension and
retraction speeds of Ellerman bombs (average 8 km s−1,
c.f. Watanabe et al. 2011) are much smaller than the
average speed of large penumbral jets (36 km s−1, this
study), and (5) although large penumbral jets and Eller-
man bombs both originate in the (higher) photosphere,

Tiwari et al.

Ellerman bombs do not have transition region signa-
tures (Rutten et al. 2013), whereas large penumbral jets
do show their direct response in the transition region
(Vissers et al. 2015; Tiwari et al. 2016).

Likewise, whether moving bright penumbral dots
(Tian et al. 2014; Alpert et al. 2016; Deng et al. 2016;
Samanta et al. 2017; Young et al. 2018) have any con-
nection with large penumbral jets needs further investi-
gation.

The thermal energy produced by each large penum-
bral jet (3/2nkBT V ) can be estimated to be 1.1 × 1025
erg (for number density n = 1018 m−3, Boltzmann con-
stant kB = 1.38 × 10−23 m2 kg s−2 K −1, temperature
T = 104 K, V = 3000 km×(1350 km)2), which is about
two orders of magnitude higher than that estimated for
microjets (e.g., Katsukawa et al. 2007). Therefore di-
rect signatures of large penumbral jets in the transition
region are not surprising (Tiwari et al. 2016), and even
a direct coronal response is plausible, and should be in-
vestigated. One must be careful with this interpretation
if an energy of 1025 erg is dumped very low
however:
in the atmosphere (e.g., in the upper photosphere), it is
possible that much of the energy is lost to radiation and,
thus, may not always lead to signatures in the transition
region.

Because the changes in the energies, which are more
meaningful, can not be calculated due to penumbral jets
being transient, we make crude estimates of kinetic, po-
tential (assuming solar gravitational force of 274 m s−2)
and total magnetic (with approximated magnetic ﬁeld
B of 1 kG) energies of large penumbral jets, which come
out to be of the order of 1026, 1025 and 1029 erg, respec-
tively, requiring only of order 0.1% of the total magnetic
energy in the volume of a large penumbral jet be released
to drive the jet.

This study of two sunspot penumbrae scanned by
IRIS, one as a coarse 8-step raster, and the other as a
medium dense 64-step raster, also highlights the impor-
tance of denser and faster rasters to address such science
questions as those addressed in this research. To accu-
rately measure diﬀerent parameters, and estimate inac-
curacies in our current measurements, e.g., relating to
their lifetimes, sizes, twisting motions, blueshift/redshift
at diﬀerent parts and in diﬀerent phases of jets, a much
faster (higher-cadence) observation program is required
that we plan to perform in future.

5. CONCLUSIONS

From the IRIS spectra and slit-jaw observations of two
sunspot penumbrae we have characterized large penum-
bral jets. We ﬁnd evidence of twisting motion of mag-
netic ﬁeld in the spire of several large penumbral jets.
Hinode (SOT) observations show mixed-polarity mag-
netic ﬁeld at the base of the most of large penumbral
jets (with a crudely approximated ﬂux cancellation rate
of the order of 1018 Mx h−1). These two results, that
large penumbral jets have mixed-polarity photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld and they twist, together may be compat-
ible with a scenario in which large penumbral jets could
be made the same way as EUV/X-ray coronal jets are
made in CHs, QRs or surrounding ARs. To conﬁrm
this, higher resolution observations (e.g., from DKIST,
and the future generation solar telescopes) and sophis-
ticated MHD simulations are required to be performed
in future.
