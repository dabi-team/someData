We report ﬁrst direct experimental evidence of interspecies ion separation in direct-drive ICF experiments
performed at the OMEGA laser facility via spectrally, temporally and spatially resolved imaging x-ray-
spectroscopy data [S. C. Hsu et al., EPL 115, 65001 (2016)]. These experiments were designed based on the
expectation that interspecies ion thermo-diﬀusion would be strongest for species with large mass and charge
diﬀerence. The targets were spherical plastic shells ﬁlled with D2 and a trace amount of Ar (0.1% or 1%
by atom). Ar K-shell spectral features were observed primarily between the time of ﬁrst-shock convergence
and slightly before neutron bang time, using a time- and space-integrated spectrometer, a streaked crystal
spectrometer, and two gated multi-monochromatic x-ray imagers ﬁelded along quasi-orthogonal lines of sight.
Detailed spectroscopic analyses of spatially resolved Ar K-shell lines reveal deviation from the initial 1% Ar
gas ﬁll and show both Ar-concentration enhancement and depletion at diﬀerent times and radial positions of
the implosion. The experimental results are interpreted with radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that include
recently implemented, ﬁrst-principles models of interspecies ion diﬀusion. The experimentally inferred Ar-
atom fraction proﬁles agree reasonably with calculated proﬁles associated with the incoming and rebounding
ﬁrst shock.

INTRODUCTION

In inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) experiments, nu-
clear fusion reactions are initiated by the heating and
compressing of a fuel target, typically in the form of a
spherical plastic (or glass) shell ﬁlled with a combina-
tion of lower-Z elements such as deuterium-tritium (DT),
deuterium-helium 3 (D3He) as fusion fuels.1,2 Sometimes
a little amount of higher-Z elements like argon (Ar) or
krypton (Kr) have also been used in the core along with
the main fuel materials for diagnostic purposes because
of their proven usefulness in x-ray spectroscopy.3–9 The
target surface is irradiated either directly by laser beams
or indirectly by x-rays obtained from the inner surface
of a hohlraum, which, in turn, ablates the outer surface
material of the target and implodes the remaining shell
and fuel due to the rocket-like blow-oﬀ of the hot sur-
face material. This process is designed to create several
shocks that travel inward across the core. The implo-
sion velocity of the fuel increases until the ﬁrst shock
reﬂects oﬀ the center of the implosion. It then decreases
until the stagnation phase during which most of the nu-
clear reactions are produced. At the stagnation phase,
the temperatures and densities of the plasmas in the
hot-spot become very high (required fuel ion temper-
ature and areal density1,2 are, respectively, Ti>10 keV
and ρR>0.3 g cm−2 for achieving ignition) and may be-
gin the burn of the fusion material in the central area.

In this process, since the implosion core contains multi-
ple ion species due to the fuel combinations and possi-
ble fuel-shell mixing during the implosion, the pressure
and temperature gradients in the imploding target can
drive ion species separation10,11 via interspecies diﬀusion
(e.g., baro-, thermo-, and electro-diﬀusion) between the
ions comprising the fuel.12–15 Such a phenomenon has
been proposed to explain the deﬁcit in nuclear yield or
yield-ratio anomalies reported in several ICF experimen-
tal campaigns.16–24 However, all these campaigns relied
on comparing total yield measurements with standard
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that do not model
multi-ion-species physics. To assess the eﬀect of inter-
species ion separation in ICF implosions quantitatively,
ﬁrst-principles analytic theories for multi-ion-species dif-
fusion are developed and being implemented in standard
implosion codes.25–27 Similarly,
ion-Fokker-Planck28,29
and particle-in-cell kinetic simulations16,30,31 are also be-
ing used to study ICF implosions, particularly in kinetic
scenarios.

The highlights of this work were previously reported
in an earlier publication.32 In this paper, we provide the
details of how we extract temporally and spatially re-
solved experimental evidence of interspecies ion separa-
tion from imaging x-ray spectroscopy data. These x-ray
data are expected to be less sensitive to other poten-
tial cause of yield degradation in an ICF implosion. An-
other purpose of this work is to complement and expand
upon prior ICF experimental campaigns that relied on
yield or yield-ratio anomalies as evidence for species sep-
aration. Our experimental campaign design was guided
by the fact that interspecies thermo-diﬀusion would be

strongest for species with large mass and charge diﬀer-
ence as discussed in Kagan et al.12–14 Therefore, we chose
implosions with D2/Ar ﬁll to maximize interspecies dif-
fusion via thermo-diﬀusion in order to obtain proof of
interspecies ion separation. We chose Ar in particular
because of its proven usefulness as an x-ray spectroscopic
tracer in ICF implosions. We analyze x-ray image data
recorded by Multi-Monochromatic x-ray Imager (MMI)
instruments.4,33 The MMI data are spectrally, tempo-
rally and spatially resolved and can be processed to ob-
tain both narrow-band images and sets of space-resolved
spectra, thus far obtainable only from MMI.4 Analyses
of the space-resolved spectra/narrow-band images yield
spatial proﬁles of plasma electron temperature, electron
density, argon atom number density, deuterium atom
number density, and argon atom number fraction in the
implosion core.

The structure of this paper is as follows.

In Sec. II,
we provide details about our OMEGA direct-drive ICF
experiments. In Sec. III, Ar modeling and the codes to
generate theoretical atomic databases are discussed. Sec-
tion IV covers all the details of the analysis method and
error analysis. Similarly, in Sec. V, we show spatial pro-
ﬁles of Ar concentration obtained from xRAGE26 simula-
tions with two-ion-species transport model, and use it to
interpret experimentally inferred Ar concentration pro-
ﬁles. Finally, we summarize the paper with some ideas
to improve the current analysis method in the future.

II. EXPERIMENTS AT OMEGA

The direct-drive ICF experiments were performed on
the OMEGA laser facility34 of the Laboratory for Laser
Energetics at the University of Rochester, NY using 60
laser beams. All laser beams were conﬁgured to have

2

the same energy, and delivered a total amount of about
21.5 or 26 kJ of UV laser energy on target with a 1 ns
square pulse shape. The targets were spherical plastic
shells (outer radius ≈ 430–439 µm) of either 13-µm shell
thickness with 5-atm D2/Ar gas ﬁll or 15-µm shell thick-
ness with 3-atm D2/Ar gas ﬁll. For each thickness/ﬁll
combination, we had both 1.0% and 0.1% Ar by atom
fraction. We use data from shot 78199 as an illustrative
case in this paper. For this shot, the total laser energy
on target, outer diameter, shell thickness, D2/Ar gas ﬁll
and Ar fraction (fAr) were approximately 21 kJ, 430 µm,
13 µm, 5 atm and 1% (by atom), respectively.

The Ar x-ray signal from the core was primarily ob-
served during the deceleration phase of the implosion
and recorded with a streaked crystal x-ray spectrometer
(mounted on TIM 1, where TIM stands for “ten-inch ma-
nipulator” diagnostic port), a time- and space-integrated,
absolutely calibrated x-ray spectrometer (mounted on
TIM 2) and two gated, MMI instruments with quasi-
orthogonal views mounted on TIM 3 and TIM 4. Stan-
dard neutron diagnostics (12-m neutron time-of-ﬂight
scintillator and crogenic neutron temporal diagnostic)
and full-aperture backscatter systems were also ﬁelded.
For our case of illustration, the yield (DD-n) and burn-
weighted ion temperature were 1.35×1011 and 6.48 keV,
respectively, obtained from the 12-m neutron time-of-
ﬂight scintillator. Similarly, the neutron bang time and
burn width were 1.313 ns and 116 ps, respectively, ob-
tained from the cryogenic neutron temporal diagnostic
(cryo-NTD). The streaked crystal spectrometer recorded
temporally and spectrally resolved but spatially inte-
grated x-ray data from the core. The MMI instru-
ment consists of a pinhole array, a multi-layered mirror
(MLM), and a micro-channel-plate (MCP) framing cam-
era detector.
In particular, the framing cameras were
equipped with 4 MCPs thus providing the opportunity
for recording up to four snapshots of the implosion with
a temporal resolution of approximately 100 ps. The
pinhole array consists of around 1000 pinholes approx-
imately 10 µm in diameter with an average separation
of 115 µm, setting the spatial resolution of the instru-
ment at ≈ 10 µm.4 The MLM (consists of 300 bilayers of
tungsten and boron-carbide with an average thickness of
15 ˚A of each) reﬂects the photons coming from the pin-
holes towards the MCP according to Bragg’s law.4 The
spectral resolution power of the MMI is λ/∆λ≈150.4 The
MMI recorded spectrally resolved implosion core images
on four MCPs i.e. four frames (frame 1 is the earliest and
frame 4 is the latest in time) between 3.3-5.5 keV around
the time of the ﬁrst shock convergence. Figure 1a shows
the pie-slice diagram of the spherical target used in the
OMEGA shot 78199, and Fig. 1b shows 78199 TIM 3
Frame 2 MMI data after processing. The horizontal axis
represents the photon energy increasing from left to right
measured in units of eV, and vertical axis represents an
array of implosion core pinhole images. The MMI data
shown in Fig. 1b consist of Ar K-shell line transitions,
i.e., Ar Heβ (1s2 − 1s3p, 3680 eV), Lyβ (1s − 3p, 3940

(a)(b)eV), Lyγ (1s − 4p, 4150 eV), and x-ray continuum ra-
diation. Note that the Heγ (1s2 − 1s4p, 3875 eV) is
blended into the red wing of Lyβ. We obtained analyz-
able MMI data for several shots with initial fAr = 1%.
Shots with initial fAr = 0.1% provided weaker spectral
lines as predicted32 and not suitable for analysis. The
important steps of processing of raw MMI data include
conversion of ﬁlm density to intensity using ﬁlm calibra-
tion, artifact removal and ﬂat-ﬁelding of the data, center
determination of monochromatic core images, photon-
energy dependent intensity corrections associated with
beryllium-ﬁlter transmission, reﬂectivity of the multilay-
ered Bragg mirror, and spectral response of the MCP.4,35
The details about the MMI instrument, data processing
method, and the extractions of narrowband images and
space-resolved spectra are described elsewhere.4,5,36 For

this work, we reconstructed narrowband images of Ar
Heβ, Lyβ and Lyγ from the MMI data. Similarly, space-
resolved spectra were extracted from the annular regions
on the core images across the MMI data. The selection of
the annular regions must be consistent with the following
two requirements: (1) size larger than spatial resolution
of the MMI instrument (≈10 µm), (2) good signal-to-
noise ratio. For the data discussed in this paper, we have
found that the images can be divided into four annular re-
gions that are consistent with these requirements. These
annular regions on the core image can be considered as

3

the projection of four concentric spherical shell zones in
the implosion core. The sizes of these zones are given
by the details of the annular regions selected on the im-
age. Figure 2a shows the schematic of the spatial zones
(represented by “a”, “b”, “c” and “d”) in the implosion
core and their projections on the image plane (annular
regions are represented by “R1”, “R2”, “R3” and “R4”)
and Fig. 2b shows the space-resolved spectra extracted
from the annular regions on the spectrally-resolved core
images of the OMEGA shot 78199 TIM 3 Frame 2 data
shown in the Fig. 1b.

III. ARGON MODELING

The calculation of x-ray spectral emissions was carried
out with the Los Alamos suite of codes.37 Atomic wave
functions, oscillator strengths, and plane-wave Born col-
lisional excitation cross sections were obtained from the
fully relativistic code RATS, which is based on the work
of Sampson et al.38 The selection of ion stages and elec-
tronic conﬁgurations was informed by the temperature
and density conditions achieved in our experiments.39
Our Ar model considers all ionization states from Ne-
like Ar to the fully-stripped ion and includes 383 en-
ergy levels (ﬁne-structure), with the following maximum
number of energy levels per ion: 1 fully stripped, 16 H-
like, 77 He-like, 97 Li-like, 40 Be-like, 50 B-like, 50 C-
like, 31 N-like, 16 O-like, 4 F-like and 1 Ne-like Ar. A
key subset of the plane-wave Born excitation cross sec-
tions from RATS was superseded with the more accu-
rate distorted-wave cross sections calculated by the ACE
code.37,40 Data for collisional ionization, autoionization,
and photoionization were computed with the GIPPER
code.37,41 Monochromatic emissivity, absorption, and
scattering databases for the elements present in our
experiments were calculated from the above-described
data via a steady-state, collisional-radiative equilibrium
model implemented in the ATOMIC code.37,42,43 Finally,
the FESTR code44 draws on the ATOMIC-generated
databases to produce spectroscopic-quality x-ray outputs
by the postprocessing of hydrodynamics simulations, and
for the veriﬁcation of our analysis technique (see Sec. IV
E). Figure 3 shows ion stages, total maximum number
of ﬁne-structure levels per ion and diﬀerent atomic pro-
cesses (represented by colored arrows) included in our
model.

IV. ANALYSIS METHOD

Our analysis method to infer Ar atom number frac-
tion spatial proﬁle consists of three steps. The ﬁrst step
is to extract electron temperature (Te) and density (ne)
spatial distributions in the implosion core by using an
emissivity analysis method.7 In the second step of the
analysis, we extract spatial distributions of Ar atom num-
ber density (nAr) by using an inversion method based on

the proportionality between intensity of a line emission
and corresponding upper-level population density.45 The
ﬁnal step uses the charge quasi-neutrality constraint to
obtain the deuterium number density (nD) and Ar atom
number fraction (fAr). We describe all the steps in detail
in the following paragraphs.

A. Extraction of Te and ne

In this step, we start from the extraction of area-
normalized intensities from the annular regions in the
narrow-band images. We divide each image into four an-
nular regions that are consistent with the requirements
mentioned in the experimental section. Figure 4a shows
the continuum-subtracted Heβ, Lyβ and Lyγ narrow-
band images reconstructed from the MMI data of the
OMEGA shot 78199 TIM 3 Frame 2. The spectral ranges
used for the reconstruction of the narrow-band images are
3640-3720 eV for Heβ, 3895-3975 eV for Lyβ, and 4110-
4190 eV for the Lyγ; each has a bandwidth of 80 eV.
Figures 4b and 4c show area-normalized intensity spatial
proﬁles extracted from the annular regions on the im-
ages and corresponding Abel-inverted emissivity proﬁles
in the implosion core. We use a generalized Abel inver-
sion (assumes optically thin approximation),7 in which
the intensity of each pixel on the image plane is asso-
ciated with the line integral of emissivity along a chord
in the core. The lines Lyβ, Heβ and Lyγ are normally
considered as optically thin.7 The three necessary con-
ditions to apply Abel inversion in our intensity proﬁles
are: 1) the intensity must be zero at the outermost region
and 2) the ﬁrst derivative of the intensity with respect
to the radius should vanish at the central region, and 3)
the narrow-band images must be suﬃciently symmetric.
To achieve the ﬁrst criterion in our intensity proﬁles, we
make extrapolations of the intensities at the outermost
regions on the images. For the second criterion, if our

proﬁle is not fairly ﬂat near the central region, we re-
place the central value by the value next to it. We will
discuss the symmetry of narrow-band images later in the
paper (Sec. IV D).

The emissivity of a line emission strongly depends on
the electron temperature and density. But the emissiv-
ity ratio of Lyβ/Heβ is strongly dependent on the elec-
tron temperature and weakly dependent on the electron
density.7 We compute an array of theoretical emissiv-
ity ratios of Lyβ/Heβ as a function of electron temper-
ature at constant electron density, and use it to relate
the spatial distribution of the experimental emissivity
ratio of Lyβ/Heβ with the spatial distribution of the
electron temperature in the core.7 Theoretical emissiv-
ities are generated via the Los Alamos suite of atomic
codes explained in Sec. III. The total emissivity of a line
(deﬁned by bandwidth) used in the analysis is a superpo-
sition of many single line contributions, including reso-
nance and satellite transitions falling in the narrow-band
spectral range. To study the sensitivity of the ratio of
the theoretical emissivity (Lyβ/Heβ) on electron den-
sity, we generate an array of theoretical emissivity ra-
tios (Lyβ/Heβ) as a function of electron temperature
at four diﬀerent electron densities (5.0×1023, 8.0×1023,
1.0×1024, 2.0×1024cm−3) in our regime of interest, and
use them to extract four temperature proﬁles in the core.
The ﬁnal Te proﬁle shown in Fig. 5a is the average of the
four temperature proﬁles.

Next, we extract the spatial distribution of the elec-
tron density by using the information about the electron
temperature proﬁle as obtained above, and solving the
following equation, which relates the theoretical and ex-
perimental emissivity,7

tially averaged electron density extracted from the ﬁtting
of space-integrated spectrum, the density gradient is con-
sidered to be the solution to the above equation. If not,
the scale factor k (and the ne gradient obtained by solv-
ing Eq. (1)) is again computed with slightly higher and
lower electron densities than the spatially averaged den-
sity mentioned above until the gradient proﬁle with the
closest match between the emissivity-weighted average
and the spatially averaged electron density is obtained.
Figure 5b shows spatial proﬁles of ne obtained from all
three lines and their average.

theoretical emissivities (in absolute units). There are two
unknowns in the equation, i.e., ne and the scale factor
k. We ﬁt the experimental space-integrated spectrum
(spectral range 3600-4200 eV; which includes Lyβ, Heβ
and Lyγ) to ﬁnd the spatially averaged density condition
in the core by assuming the implosion core as a single
uniform slab in the optically thin approximation. We
then use the spatially averaged density to determine the
scale factor between the experimental and the theoreti-
cal emissivity in Eq. (1), and solve the equation to ex-
tract the ne gradient in the implosion core. Next, an
emissivity-weighted average of the electron density gra-

B. Extraction of nAr

In the second step of the analysis, we start with the
extraction of spatial distributions of upper-level popula-
tions associated with diﬀerent K-shell line emissions of
Ar ions (in arbitrary units) in the implosion core, and
use them to extract ion number densities (in absolute
units).45 To extract spatial proﬁles of upper-level pop-
ulation densities, we exploit the proportionality of the

tically thin approximation to the upper-level population
number density, the photon energy, the spontaneous ra-
diative decay of the line transition and the volume of the
emission. A system of equations is set up for the to-
tal intensities of a line in all four annular space-resolved
spectra. The solution of the equations provides the set of
the upper-level population number densities (in arbitrary
units) associated with a line emission in all four spatial
zones in the core (spatial zones are shown in the Fig. 2a),

where I4, I3, I2 and I1 are the total line intensities ob-
tained from the space-resolved spectra extracted from the
annular regions R4, R3, R2 and R1, respectively, of the
implosion core image. Aul and hνul are the spontaneous
radiative decay rate and photon energy associated with
the center of a line, which we obtained from the LANL
atomic database. “V ” are the volumes of diﬀerent spher-
ical sections (which deﬁne domains of integrations in the
core for annular regions in the image) of the implosion
core, and obtained from the MMI processing code4 and
geometry analysis. nua, nub, nuc, and nud are the upper-
level population number densities of a line in the spher-
ical zones a, b, c and d, respectively, of the implosion
core (as shown in the schematic of the implosion core
in Fig. 2a). Total line intensities are obtained from the
experimental space-resolved spectra extracted from the
annular regions of the implosion core image by numeri-
cally integrating the area under the line after continuum
subtraction. Figure 6a shows an example to illustrate
the method to obtain continuum-subtracted total inten-
sity associated with line emissions. Integrated regions are
shown as shaded. For each line, total intensities are found
from all four space-resolved spectra. The narrow-band
spectral range is always the same for a chosen spectral
line. Equation (2a) outputs the upper-level population
density in the outermost spherical zone, i.e., d as shown
in Fig. 2a. Equation (2b) uses the output of Eq. (2a) as
the input and yields the upper-level population density
in the spherical zone c. Similarly, Eq. (2c) uses the out-
puts from Eqs. (2a) and (2b) as the inputs, and yields
the upper-level population density in the spherical zone b.
Finally, the upper-level population densities produced by
Eqs. (2a), (2b) and (2c) are used as the inputs to Eq. (2d),
and which, in turn, provides the upper-level population
density in the spherical zone a, i.e., the innermost spher-
ical zone of the implosion core. The spectral ranges used
for the analysis were 3640–3720 eV, 3895–3975 eV and
4110–4190 eV for Heβ, Lyβ and Lyγ, respectively, as in

6

the narrow-band images. To account for the opacity ef-
fect on these intensities, the optically thick formula for
the emergent intensity of a slab can be integrated with
respect to photon energy to obtain an optically thick ap-
proximation to the total line intensity (Appendix B of
Ref. 45). The optically thick line intensities are smaller
than that obtained in the optically thin approximation
due to the self-absorption of the line intensities. As a ﬁrst
step towards the opacity corrections, we have approx-
imated the opacity correction in our intensities (given
by Eqs. (2a)–(2d)) by considering an eﬀective volume of
integration (eﬀective volumes are slightly smaller than
the actual volumes)45. In this manner we can approxi-
mate the eﬀect of opacity while using a procedure derived
within the optically thin approximation (Eqs. 2).

To calculate the Ar ion number density, we use the fol-
lowing relation between the upper-level population num-
ber density of a line transition, ion number density and
fractional level population of the upper-level associated
with a line transition,

nu = nArFu(Te, ne)

(3)

where Fu(Te, ne) is the fractional level population associ-
ated with the upper level of a line emission and which we
retrieve from the LANL atomic database based on the
previously determined (in step 1) ne(r) and Te(r) val-
ues. The upper-level population density in each spherical
zone in the implosion core (nu) is obtained as mentioned
above. Ar atom number densities in arbitrary units are
determined in this way from as many line emission fea-
tures as observed in the data and compared to each for
consistency. Finally, we use the known pre-ﬁll amount of
Ar (1% of Ar by atom, ≈7.45×1014 Ar atoms for shot
78199) to convert Ar atom number density in arbitrary
units into absolute units by assuming conservation of Ar
atoms in the implosion core. Fig. 6b and 6c show, respec-
tively, spatial proﬁles of upper-level population density
and ion number density extracted from Heβ, Lyβ and
Lyγ in the implosion core of OMEGA shot 78199 TIM 3
Frame 2.

C. Extraction of fAr

The ﬁnal step uses the charge quasi-neutrality con-

straint to extract deuterium number density,

ne = nArZAr(Te, ne) + nDZD(Te, ne).

(4)

In Eq. (4), everything is known except the deuterium
number density (nD). The ionization balances for Ar
and D at the given Te and ne (as determined in step 1)
are obtained from the LANL atomic database, and nAr
is obtained from the second step as described above. Fi-
nally, fAr is inferred from the following expression:

fAr =

nAr
nAr + nD

D. Symmetry analysis of narrow-band images

In order to apply the generalized Abel inversion7 in
narrow-band images, the images should be axially sym-
metric. We observe some inhomogeneities in our narrow-
band images shown in Fig. 8a. To study the eﬀect of
these inhomogeneities on the ne and Te spatial proﬁles
extracted from the images above, we divided Heβ and
Lyβ narrow-band images into three wedges of 120◦ each,
and each wedge was further divided into four radial zones.
The number of wedges and radial zones were determined
based on the spatial resolution of the MMI instrument.
We then extracted intensity, emissivity, ne and Te spatial
proﬁles for all three regions. Fig. 8a shows the narrow-
band images divided into three wedges of 120◦ each; 8b

tent with the results obtained from the complete “Annu-
lar” regions and the standard deviations across the three
wedges are similar to the error bars shown in the Figs. 5a
and 5b. These results justify our assumption of 1D spher-
ical symmetry in the analysis within the constraints of
the spatial resolution of the instrument.

E. Synthetic data analysis

To accomplish the veriﬁcation of our analysis method,
we generated synthetic Ar Heβ, Lyβ and Lyγ narrow-
band images and space-resolved spectra using the same
spectral range, ne, and Te as in the case of OMEGA shot
78199 TIM 3 Frame 2 experimental results, and then
used the same data analysis method to infer Ar atom
number fraction vs.
core radius. The synthetic data
was generated with the FESTR code in forward recon-
struction mode44 and assuming 1D spherical symmetry.
Figure 9 displays results obtained from the analysis of
synthetic narrow-band images and space-resolved spec-
tra. Figure 9a shows Ar atom number density (nAr) vs.
core radius. Similarly, 9b and 9c, respectively, show D
atom number density (nD) and Ar atom number fraction
vs. core radius. The trends of the results are similar and
diﬀerences in the values are within the error included in
the experimental data analysis. There is a little more
spread in the central values in 9a and 9c; this could be
due to the approximations of opacity corrections (i.e., use
of eﬀective volumes) to our intensities (Eqs. (2a)-(2d))
and the uncertainties considered in our analysis method.

F. Error analysis in the experimental data

The potential sources of uncertainty in experimentally
inferred Te are: 1) the resolution of the electron temper-
ature in the theoretical database (100 eV), 2) asymmetry
in the narrow-band images, and 3) theoretical emissivity
ratios of Lyβ to Heβ as a function of electron tempera-
ture computed at constant ne with the assumption that
the emissivity ratio depends strongly on electron temper-
ature but weakly on electron density. Figure 10a shows
the uncertainties in Te as a function of the core radius due
to all the sources mentioned above. The red curve shows
Te resolution in the database as a function of the core ra-
dius. The green curve shows asymmetry in Te (standard
deviation in Te) vs. core radius across the three wedges of
the narrow-band images shown in the Fig. 8a. To study
the sensitivity of the ratio of the theoretical emissivity
(Lyβ/Heβ) vs. Te on ne, we evaluated the ratio at four
diﬀerent ne values in our regime of interest (5.0×1023,
8.0×1023, 1.0×1024, 2.0×1024 cm−3). The blue curve
shows the standard deviation in Te, obtained from the
temperature spread due to the use of diﬀerent emissiv-
ity ratio tables evaluated at electron densities mentioned
above, as a function of core radius. The ﬁnal error for
the experimental Te in each spatial zone in the implosion
core is obtained based on the greatest of the uncertainties
in the above mentioned three curves.

Similarly, Fig. 10b shows uncertainties in the experi-
mental ne. The red curve shows resolution of ne in the
theoretical database as a function of implosion core ra-
dius. The green curve shows asymmetry in ne due to
the non-uniformities in the narrowband images shown in
Fig. 8a (standard deviation of ne across the three wedges

ne in the database. The tabulation errors (temperature-
density grid steps in the atomic database) can be reduced
by performing 2D interpolation. For the cases consid-
ered here, the tabulation errors (see Fig. 10) are approx-
imately similar to the other errors for the most part, and
do not alter the ﬁnal conclusions of the error analyses.

From Eq. (3), it can be seen that the total error in nAr
depends on the error propagation from nu and Fu(Te, ne).
The error in nu is determined based on the uncertainty
associated with the photon-energy integrated intensity
(total intensities in Eqs. (2a)-(2d)) because of the uncer-
tainty in the subtraction of the continuum level. To ﬁnd
the error in nu, we ﬁrst extract the intensities of a line
from each annular space-resolved spectrum several times
by re-estimating continuum levels with a slightly diﬀerent
(slightly higher or lower with each other) spectral ranges.
After plugging these intensities into Eqs. (2a)–(2d), we
obtain a set of nu values for a line in each spatial zone
in the implosion core. Then, we ﬁnd standard deviations
of nu values of a line in each spatial zone and use them

of the narrowband images). Finally, the blue curve rep-
resents the standard deviation (SD) of ne obtained from
the diﬀerences in the results from the three Ar K-shell
lines present in the MMI data. Again, the ﬁnal error for
the experimental ne in each spatial zone in the implosion
core is obtained based on the greatest of the uncertain-
ties in the above mentioned three curves. Furthermore,
we have observed that the error on ne due to the uncer-
tainty in Te is either zero or equal to the resolution of

as the ﬁnal errors in the upper-level population densities
of that line. The error in Fu(Te, ne) depends on the er-
ror propagation from Te and ne, and can be obtained by
using Eq. (6) (based on Eq. (3.14) of Ref. 46)

where the ﬁrst term represents the error associated with
the change of fractional upper-level population density
with respect to the change of electron temperature at
constant electron density, and the second term represents
the error associated with the change of fractional upper
level population with respect to the change of electron
density at constant electron temperature. The outer-
most zone shows a higher percentage error because of
the higher percentage error in the electron density in
that zone. Similarly, the error propagation formula for
nAr is given in Eq. (7a). Equation (7b) can be obtained
by plugging Eq. (3) in Eq. (7a).The ﬁnal error of nAr was
obtained by propagating errors on nu and Fu to Eq. (7b),

in ZAr and ZD due to the uncertainties in Te and ne
are very small). Equation (8b) can be obtained by plug-
ging the charge-neutrality condition given by Eq. (4) in
Eq. (8a). We calculated errors in nD extracted from all
the three lines.

Finally, the error propagation formula for fAr is given

calculated error in fAr by propagating errors on nAr and
nD to Eq. (9b). Table I summarizes all the results in-

V. COMPARISON OF MMI RESULTS WITH
HYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATIONS

Next, we performed 1D simulations of shot 78199 us-
ing xRAGE25 with a two-ion-species transport model46
to support our results obtained from the analysis method
explained in the previous section. The brief comparisons
between the experimental and simulated fAr were pre-
viously reported.32 We provide further comparisons and
interpretations of the experimental results and simula-
tions in this paper. Figure 11a shows the experimentally
inferred fAr vs. r (implosion core radius) for shot 78199
from the data recorded by two MMIs ﬁelded along quasi-
orthogonal directions, i.e., TIM 3 Frame 2 and TIM 4
Frame 1 with a trigger-time diﬀerence of approximately
40 ps. The bang time (BT) recorded by cryo-NTD for
this shot was 1.313 ns, and trigger times for TIM 4 Frame
1 and TIM 3 Frame were, respectively, 1.10 ns (red curve,
84% of BT) and 1.14 ns (blue curve, 87% of BT). Fig-
ure 11(b) shows fAr for the same shot obtained from the

1D simulations mentioned above. The red, green and
blue curves represent, respectively, spatial proﬁles of fAr
at 1.10 ns (≈ 82% of BT), 1.15 ns (≈ 85% of BT) and 1.35
ns (≈ 100% of BT); all three curves show Ar depletion
ahead of the incoming (or rebounding) shock followed
by enhancement behind the incoming (or rebounding)
shock. Furthermore, when we turned oﬀ the ion thermo-
diﬀusion in the simulation, the strongest expected con-
tributor to interspecies separation between D and Ar, in
the calculation, no signiﬁcant Ar-concentration variation
from the 1% uniform pre-ﬁll was obtained. The direction
and location of the shocks are represented by the arrows
in Figs. 11a and 1b.

While a detailed validation of the species-separation
model is beyond the scope of this work, we have found
resonable agreement between data and simulation of shot
78199. The magnitude of the peak in fAr(≈ 1.5%)
agrees well between experiment (Fig. 11a) and simulation
(Fig. 11b). The overall eﬀects of incoming/rebounding
shocks on species separation as predicted by the simula-
tion, i.e., argon depletion (equivalently, D enhancement)
in front of the incoming shock and argon enhancement
behind the incoming and rebounding shocks, are also seen
in the experimental results. Speciﬁcally, the red curve of
Fig. 11a at 1.10 ns shows lower argon concentration for r
≤ 30 µm, which we interpret to be ahead of the incom-
ing shock (presumed to be located around 40 µm at that
time). However, there is less correspondence in timing
between experiment and simulation.
In the simulation
(as shown in Fig. 11b), shock ﬂash occurs just after the
time of the green curve (≈85% of bang time in the sim-
ulation), at which time fAr ≥ 1% for r ≥ 10 µm, sug-
gesting that the incoming shock is located around 10 µm
at that time. In the experimental result (Fig. 11a), our
interpretation is that the incoming shock at 1.10 ns (red
curve at ≈ 84% of BT) is located around 40 µm. Forty
picoseconds later (blue curve at 1.14 ns, 87% of BT) our
interpretation is that the shock has just rebounded and
hence fAr > 1% at the origin. Thus, there is qualita-
tive agreement between experiment and simulation in the
time evolution of the expected behavior of fAr from ear-
lier to later in time, even though there is not exact time
correspondence in the absolute time relative to BT. One
possible explanation for the key diﬀerences between ex-
periment and simulations is that, in reality, there is more
D enhancement ahead of the shock front due to kinetic
streaming of the D ahead of the shock. This does not oc-

cur in the ﬂuid-based model of our simulation. Secondly,
our xRAGE simulations (at the moment) model binary
interspecies diﬀusion (in our case, between D and Ar in
the hot spot), and do not model the interspecies diﬀusion
across the gas-shell interface. Thus the xRAGE predic-
tions of fAr are subject to the lack of CH mixed into the
hot spot. In future work, we will be able to better assess
this diﬀerence, as there are plans to include N-species ion
diﬀusion in xRAGE, which would allow us to explicitly
model shell/gas interspecies ion diﬀusion.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have reported the details (experiments and anal-
ysis method) of
the ﬁrst direct experimental evi-
dence for interspecies ion separation in direct-drive ICF
experiments32 performed at the OMEGA laser facility,
via detailed analyses of imaging x-ray spectroscopy data.
Our targets were spherical plastic shells ﬁlled with D2
and Ar, designed to maximize interspecies ion thermo-
diﬀusion between ion species of large mass and charge
diﬀerence. Ar K-shell spectral features were observed
primarily between the time of ﬁrst-shock convergence
and slightly before the neutron bang time, using a time-
and space-integrated spectrometer, streaked crystal spec-
trometer, and two gated multi-monochromatic x-ray im-
agers (MMI) ﬁelded along quasi-orthogonal lines of sight.
The spectrally resolved MMI data were processed to ob-
tain narrow-band images and radially resolved spectra.
Our analysis method to infer Ar atom number fraction
spatial proﬁles used three steps.
In the ﬁrst step, we
extracted the electron temperature and density spatial
distribution by performing analyses of emissivity pro-
ﬁles of K-shell lines extracted from the MMI narrowband
images.7 In the second step, spatial distributions of Ar
atom number density were obtained by using a new in-
version method45 based on the annular space-resolved
spectra extracted from the MMI data. In the ﬁnal step,
we used the charge quasi-neutrality constraint to obtain
deuterium number density and Ar atom number fraction
fAr. The details of the error propagation techniques and
quantitative values for shot 78199 TIM 3 Frame 2 have
been discussed. Errors in the ﬁnal results were obtained
by propagating uncertainties from step 1 to step 3 in-
cluding all the possible sources of uncertainties in each
step. The simulations show that fAr is enhanced and

depleted, respectively, in front of and behind the ﬁrst in-
coming shock and our data agree reasonably well with
the calculated eﬀects on fAr due to the incoming and
rebounding ﬁrst shock.32

In forthcoming work, we would like to quantify the ef-
fect of shell/gas mix on our extraction of fAr by using
N -species modeling and extracting CH concentration in
the core. Similarly, we would like to quantify Ar dif-
fusion into the shell and its eﬀect on our extraction of
fAr. Also, we want to obtain argon density by absolute
photo-calibration of MMI data, and compare with the
present result that assumes conservation of argon atoms.
We were unable to observe the experimental Ar K-shell
spectral signatures late in time in the implosion (around
the time of the peak compression), and thus are unable
to report whether interspecies ion separation is observed
through bang time. In future experiments we could try
a higher-Z element other than Ar in some of our tar-
gets to observe whether species separation persists at
bang time (we believe that Ar may be completely ion-
ized at the temperature and density conditions achieved
at peak compression/neutron bang time). Nevertheless,
this ﬁrst result using x-ray spectroscopy to detect inter-
species ion separation encourages further work toward
establishing a validated capability to address its role in
yield degradation of ignition-scale ICF implosions.32 Fu-
ture work will also include use of Pareto genetic algorithm
and Levenberg-Marquardt methods47 with FESTR44 to
build an automated search and optimization technique
to extract 3D proﬁles of tracer concentration in the im-
plosion core.
