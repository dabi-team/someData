Summary

This research is motivated by discovering and underpinning genetic causes for the progression of a

bilateral eye disease, Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), of which the primary outcomes,

progression times to late-AMD, are bivariate and interval-censored due to intermittent assessment

times. We propose a novel class of copula-based semiparametric transformation models for bivari-

ate data under general interval censoring, which includes the case 1 interval censoring (current

status data) and case 2 interval censoring. Speciﬁcally, the joint likelihood is modeled through

a two-parameter Archimedean copula, which can ﬂexibly characterize the dependence between

the two margins in both tails. The marginal distributions are modeled through semiparametric

transformation models using sieves, with the proportional hazards or odds model being a special

case. We develop a computationally eﬃcient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure for

the unknown parameters, together with a generalized score test for the regression parameter(s).

For the proposed sieve estimators of ﬁnite-dimensional parameters, we establish their asymptotic

normality and eﬃciency. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the

proposed method in ﬁnite samples. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide analysis of

AMD progression using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) data, to successfully iden-

tify novel risk variants associated with the disease progression. We also produce predicted joint

and conditional progression-free probabilities, for patients with diﬀerent genetic characteristics.

1. Introduction

Bivariate time-to-event endpoints are frequently used as co-primary outcomes in biomedical and

epidemiological ﬁelds. For example, two time-to-event endpoints are often seen in clinical trials

studying the progression (or recurrence) of bilateral diseases (e.g., eye diseases) or complex dis-

eases (e.g., cancer and psychiatric disorders). The two endpoints are correlated as they come from

the same individual. Bivariate interval-censored data arise when both events are not precisely

observed due to intermittent assessment times. Therefore, the event times are only known to

belong to an interval (i.e., case 2 interval-censored). A further complication is that the event

status can be indeterminate (i.e., right-censored) for individuals who are event-free at their last

assessment time. The special case when there exists only one assessment time, leading to the

bivariate current status data (events are either left- or right-censored), can also happen for some

individuals. Therefore, the bivariate data we are interested in modeling are under general interval

censoring, which may include a mixture of left-, right- and interval-censored data.

Our motivating example of such bivariate general interval-censored data came from a large

clinical trial studying the progression of a bilateral eye disease, Age-related Macular Degeneration

(AMD), of which the two-eyes from the same patient were periodically examined for late-AMD.

The study aims to discover genetic variants that are signiﬁcantly associated with AMD pro-

gression, as well as to characterize both the joint and conditional risks of AMD progression.

For example, the joint 5-year progression-free probability for both eyes is a clinically signiﬁcant

measure to group patients into diﬀerent risk categories. Similarly, for patients who have one eye

already progressed, the conditional 5-year progression-free probability for the non-progressed eye

(given its fellow eye already progressed) is vital to both clinicians and patients. Therefore, a de-

sired statistical method needs to characterize and predict both joint and conditional risk proﬁles

and assess the covariate eﬀects on them.

There are several approaches to model bivariate interval-censored data. For example, Goggins

and Finkelstein (2000), Kim and Xue (2002), Chen and others (2007), Tong and others (2008) and

Chen and others (2013) ﬁtted various marginal models for multivariate interval-censored data. All

these approaches model the marginal distributions based on the working independence assump-

tion, and thus cannot produce joint or conditional distributions. Another popular method is based

on frailty models (for example, Oakes, 1982), which are mixed eﬀects models with a latent frailty

variable applied to the conditional hazard functions. For example, Chen and others (2009) and

Chen and others (2014) built frailty proportional hazards (PH) models with piecewise constant

baseline hazards for multivariate current status data and interval-censored data, respectively. Wen

and Chen (2013) and Wang and others (2015) developed Gamma-frailty PH models for bivariate

interval-censored data through a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation approach and

bivariate current status data through a sieve estimation approach, respectively. Recently, Zhou

and others (2017) and Zeng and others (2017) proposed frailty-based transformation models for

bivariate or multivariate interval-censored data, and obtained parameter estimates through the

sieve maximum likelihood estimation and nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation, respec-

tively. For frailty models, the covariate eﬀects are typically interpreted on the conditional level

by conditioning on the random frailty term.

The third popular approach is based on copula models (Clayton, 1978, for example). Unlike

the marginal or frailty approaches, the copula-based methods directly connect the two marginal

4

T. SUN and Y. DING

distributions through a copula function to construct the joint distribution, of which the copula

parameter determines the dependence. This unique feature makes the modeling of the margins

separable from the copula function, which is attractive from both the modeling perspective and

the interpretation purpose. Both joint and conditional distributions can be obtained from copula

models. Several copula models have been proposed in the literature. Wang and others (2008) used

sieve estimation in a copula model with PH margins for bivariate current status data. Cook and

Tolusso (2009) and Kor and others (2013) developed estimating equations for copula models with

piecewise constant baseline marginal hazards for clustered current status and interval-censored

data, respectively. Hu and others (2017) developed a semiparametric sieve approach for bivari-

ate current status data using copula framework with PH margins. To date, most copula-based

regression models only handle a speciﬁc interval censoring type and are often limited to the PH

assumption. Also, the most frequently used copula models, such as Clayton, Gumbel, and Frank,

all use only one dependence parameter, which can be lack of ﬂexibility.

Goethals and others (2008) and Wienke (2010) have discussed the connection and distinction

between copula and frailty models. For example, the Clayton copula has the same mathematical

expression as the Gamma frailty model in terms of the joint survival distribution. However, their

marginal survival functions are modeled diﬀerently. Speciﬁcally, the marginal function under the

Clayton model only involves the time and covariate eﬀects, whereas the marginal function under

the Gamma frailty model includes time and covariate eﬀects, and also the frailty parameter. As

a result, the joint distribution functions of the Clayton copula and Gamma frailty models are

not equivalent, except when the two margins are independent. More details are discussed in the

Appendix C of Supplementary Materials. In this paper, the objectives of our real study lead us to

choose copula-based models, which oﬀer a straightforward interpretation of covariate eﬀects and

dependence strength, as well as an easy generation of joint and conditional survival distributions.

We propose a class of copula-based semiparametric transformation model for bivariate data

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

subject to general interval censoring. For the copula model, we use a two-parameter copula

function that can ﬂexibly handle dependence structure on both upper and lower tails, and the

dependence strength can be quantiﬁed via Kendall’s τ . For the marginal model, we use the semi-

parametric transformation model that incorporates a variety of models including PH and PO

models. We approximate the inﬁnite-dimensional nuisance parameters using sieves with Bern-

stein polynomials and propose a novel maximum likelihood estimation procedure which is com-

putationally stable and eﬃcient. We establish the asymptotic normality and eﬃciency for the

sieve estimators of ﬁnite-dimensional model parameters. Moreover, we develop a computationally

eﬃcient generalized score test with numerical approximations of the score function and observed

Fisher information for testing a large number of covariates (e.g., millions of SNPs). Lastly, the

joint distribution can be directly obtained from our model, making it applicable to estimating

the joint and conditional progression proﬁles for patients with diﬀerent characteristics.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and the joint likelihood

function. Section 3 presents the sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure, the asymptotic

properties, and the generalized score test. Section 4 illustrates extensive simulation studies for

the estimation and testing performances of our proposed methods. We analyze the AREDS data

and present the ﬁndings in Section 5. Finally, we discuss and conclude in Section 6. Additional

simulation and analysis results, the regularity conditions, proofs and additional technical details

are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

2. Notation and Likelihood

2.1 Copula model for bivariate censored data

Assume there are n independent subjects in a study. For subject i, we observe Di = {(Lij, Rij, Zij),

j = 1, 2}, where (Lij, Rij] is the time interval that the true event time Tij lies in and Zij is the

covariate vector. When Rij = ∞, Tij is right-censored, and when Lij = 0, Tij is left-censored. We

6

T. SUN and Y. DING

deﬁne the marginal survival function for subject i margin j as Sj(tij|Zij) = pr(Tij > tij|Zij) and

the joint survival function for subject i as S(ti1, ti2|Zi1, Zi2) = pr(Ti1 > ti1, Ti2 > ti2|Zi1, Zi2).

By the Sklar’s theorem (Sklar, 1959), so long as marginal survival functions Sj are continuous,

there exists a unique function Cη that connects two marginal survival functions into the joint

survival function: S(t1, t2|Z1, Z2) = Cη(S1(t1|Z1), S2(t2|Z2)), t1, t2 (cid:62) 0. Here, the function Cη

is called a copula, which maps [0, 1]2 onto [0, 1] and its parameter η measures the dependence

between the two margins. A signature feature of the copula is that it allows the dependence to

be modeled separately from the marginal distributions (Nelsen, 2006).

One favorite copula family for bivariate censored data is the Archimedean copula family,

which usually has an explicit formula. Two frequently used Archimedean copulas are the Clayton

(Clayton, 1978) and Gumbel (Gumbel, 1960) copula models, which account for the lower or upper

tail dependence between two margins using a single parameter.

Here, we consider a more ﬂexible two-parameter Archimedean copula model (Joe, 1997), which

is formulated as

Cα,κ(u, v) = [1 + {(u−1/κ − 1)1/α + (v−1/κ − 1)1/α}α]−κ, α ∈ (0, 1], κ ∈ (0, ∞),

(2.1)

where u and v are two uniformly distributed margins. The two dependence parameters (α and

κ) account for the correlation between u and v at both upper and lower tails, and they explicitly

connect to the Kendall’s τ with τ = 1 − 2ακ/(2κ + 1). In particular, when α = 1, the two-

parameter copula (2.1) becomes the Clayton copula, and when κ → ∞, it becomes the Gumbel

copula. Thus, the two-parameter copula model provides more ﬂexibility in characterizing the

dependence than the Clayton or Gumbel copula.

2.2 Joint likelihood for bivariate data under general interval censoring

Based on the notation introduced in Section 2.1, the joint likelihood function using the two-

parameter copula model can be written as

Ln(S1, S2, α, κ | D) =

n
(cid:89)

i=1

pr(Li1 < Ti1 (cid:54) Ri1, Li2 < Ti2 (cid:54) Ri2 | Zi1, Zi2)

(cid:26)

n
(cid:89)

=

i=1

pr(Ti1 > Li1, Ti2 > Li2 | Zi1, Zi2) − pr(Ti1 > Li1, Ti2 > Ri2 | Zi1, Zi2)

−pr(Ti1 > Ri1, Ti2 > Li2 | Zi1, Zi2) + pr(Ti1 > Ri1, Ti2 > Ri2 | Zi1, Zi2)

n
(cid:89)

(cid:20)
Cα,κ{S1(Li1 | Zi1), S2(Li2 | Zi2)} − Cα,κ{S1(Li1 | Zi1), S2(Ri2 | Zi2)}

=

i=1

−Cα,κ{S1(Ri1 | Zi1), S2(Li2 | Zi2)} + Cα,κ{S1(Ri1 | Zi1), S2(Ri2 | Zi2)}

(cid:27)

(cid:21)
.

(2.2)

For a given subject i, if Tij is right-censored, then any term involving Rij becomes 0 (since Rij

is set to be ∞). Then the joint survival function for subject i reduces to either only one term (if

both Ti1 and Ti2 are right-censored) or two terms (if one Tij is right-censored). The particular

case of current status data can also ﬁt into this model frame, where either Lij is 0 (if the event

has already occurred before the examination time, which is Rij in this case) or Rij is ∞ (if the

event has not happened upon the examination time, which is Lij in this case). Therefore, the

likelihood function (2.2) can handle the general form of bivariate interval-censored data.

2.3 Semiparametric linear transformation model for marginal survival functions

We consider the semiparametric transformation models for marginal survival functions:

Sj(t | Zj) = exp[−Gj{exp(Z T

j βj)Λj(t)}], j = 1, 2,

(2.3)

where Gj(·) is a pre-speciﬁed strictly increasing function, βj is a vector of unknown regression

coeﬃcients, and Λj(·) is an unknown non-decreasing function of t. In model (2.3), the transfor-

mation function Gj(·), the regression parameter βj and the inﬁnite-dimensional parameter Λj(·)

8

T. SUN and Y. DING

are all denoted as margin-speciﬁc (indexed by j) for generality. In practice, some or all of them

can be the same for the two margins, and in that case, the corresponding index j can be dropped.

This model (2.3) contains a class of survival models. For example, when G(x) = x, the

marginal survival function follows a PH model. When G(x) = log(1 + x), the marginal function

becomes a proportional odds (PO) model. In practice, the transformation function can also be

“estimated” by the data. For example, the commonly used Box-Cox transformation G(x) =

{(1 + x)r − 1}/r, r > 0, or the logarithmic transformation G(x) = log(1 + rx)/r, r > 0, can

be assumed. The PH and PO models are special cases in both transformation classes. Then the

parameter r in G(·) can be estimated together with other parameters in the likelihood, as we will

demonstrate in our simulation studies.

3. Estimation and Inference

3.1 Sieve likelihood with Bernstein polynomials

In our likelihood function, we are interested in estimating the unknown parameter θ ∈ Θ:

Θ = {θ = (βT

1 , βT

2 , α, κ, Λ1, Λ2)T ∈ B ⊗ M ⊗ M}.

Here B = {(β = (βT

1 , βT

2 )T , α, κ) ∈ Rp × R(0,1] × R+, (cid:107)β(cid:107) + (cid:107)α(cid:107) + (cid:107)κ(cid:107) (cid:54) M } with p being the

dimension of β and M being a positive constant. We denote by M the collection of all bounded,

continuous and nondecreasing, nonnegative functions over [c, u], where 0 (cid:54) c < u < ∞. In

practice, [c, u] can be chosen as the range of all Lij and Rij.

In our log-likelihood function ln(θ; D) = log Ln(θ; D) = (cid:80)n

i=1 log L(θ; Di) = (cid:80)n

i=1 l(θ; Di),

there are ﬁnite-dimensional parameters of interest (β, α, κ) and two inﬁnite-dimensional nuisance

parameters (Λ1, Λ2), which need to be estimated simultaneously. Unlike the right-censored data,

tools like partial likelihood and martingale can not be applied to the interval-censored data due

to the absence of exact event times. Instead, following Huang and Rossini (1997), we employ the

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

9

sieve approach and form a sieve likelihood. Speciﬁcally, similar to Zhou and others (2017), we use

Bernstein polynomials to build a sieve space Θn = {θn = (βT , α, κ, Λ1n, Λ2n)T ∈ B ⊗Mn ⊗Mn}.

Here, Mn is the space deﬁned by Bernstein polynomials:

(cid:26)

Mn =

Λjn(t) =

mn(cid:88)

k=0

φjkBk(t, mn, c, u) :

mn(cid:88)

k=0

|φjk| (cid:54) Mn; 0 (cid:54) φj0 (cid:54) · · · (cid:54) φjmn ; j = 1, 2

(cid:27)

,

where Bk(t, mn, c, u) represents the Bernstein basis polynomial deﬁned as:

Bk(t, mn, c, u) =

(cid:18)mn
k

(cid:19)
(

t − c
u − c

)k(1 −

t − c
u − c

)mn−k; k = 0, ..., mn,

(3.1)

with degree mn = o(nν) for some ν ∈ (0, 1). We assume the basis polynomials Bk(t, mn, c, u) are

the same between the two margins, while the coeﬃcients φjk can be margin-speciﬁc. In practice,

one may choose mn based on model AIC values. With a pre-speciﬁed mn, we solve φjk together

with other parameters (β, α, κ). One big advantage of Bernstein polynomials is that they can

achieve the non-negativity and monotonicity properties of Λj(t) through re-parameterization

(Zhou and others, 2017). Another advantage of Bernstein polynomials is that they do not require

the speciﬁcation of interior knots, as seen from (3.1), making them ﬂexible for use.

With the sieve space deﬁned above, Λj(t) will be approximated by Λjn(t) ∈ Mn. In the next

section, we propose an estimation procedure to maximize ln(θ; D) over the sieve space Θn to

obtain the sieve maximum likelihood estimators ˆθn = ( ˆβT

n , ˆαn, ˆκn, ˆΛ1n, ˆΛ2n)T .

3.2 Estimation procedure for sieve maximum likelihood estimators ˆθn

We develop a novel sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure that is generally applicable

to any choice of Archimedean copulas and marginal models. In principle, we can obtain the sieve

maximum likelihood estimators by maximizing the joint likelihood function (2.2) in one step. Due

to the complex structure of the joint likelihood function, we recommend using a separate step to

obtain appropriate initial values for all the unknown parameters. In essence, (βj, Λjn) are ﬁrst

estimated marginally in step 1(a). Then their estimators are plugged into the joint likelihood to

10

T. SUN and Y. DING

form a pseudo-likelihood. In step 1(b), the dependence parameters (α, κ) are estimated through

maximizing the pseudo-likelihood function. Finally, using initial values from step 1(a) and 1(b),

we update all the unknown parameters simultaneously under the joint log-likelihood function in

step 2. The estimation procedure is described below:

1. Obtain initial estimates of θn:

(a) ( ˆβ(1)

jn , ˆΛ(1)

jn ) = arg max(βj ,Λjn) ljn(βj, Λjn), where ljn denotes the sieve log-likelihood

for the marginal model, j = 1, 2;

(b) (ˆα(1)

n , ˆκ(1)

n ) = arg max(α,κ) ln( ˆβ(1)

n = ( ˆβ(1)

1n , ˆβ(1)

2n ), α, κ, ˆΛ(1)

1n , ˆΛ(1)

2n ), where ˆβ(1)

jn and ˆΛ(1)

jn

are the initial estimates from (a), and ln is the joint sieve log-likelihood.

2. Simultaneously maximize the joint sieve log-likelihood to get ﬁnal estimates:

ˆθn = ( ˆβn, ˆαn, ˆκn, ˆΛ1n, ˆΛ2n) = arg max(β,α,κ,Λ1n,Λ2n) ln(β, α, κ, Λ1n, Λ2n) with initial values

( ˆβ(1)

n , ˆα(1)

n , ˆκ(1)

n , ˆΛ(1)

1n , ˆΛ(1)

2n ) obtained from step 1(a) and 1(b).

For the variance-covariance of ﬁnite-dimensional parameter estimates ( ˆβn, ˆαn, ˆκn), we invert

the observed information matrix of all parameters including the nuisance parameters (φjk) from

the last iteration of step 2 and then take the corresponding block. In section 3.3, we establish

the asymptotic normality and semiparametric eﬃciency for the ﬁnite-dimensional parameters.

However, since the asymptotic variance form is intractable, we adopt this heuristic approach,

which has been shown to work well in practice (Ding and Nan, 2011).

Some standard optimization algorithms such as the Newton-Raphson algorithm or the con-

jugate gradient algorithm can be employed to obtain the maximizers and observed information

matrix. Due to the complex structure of the joint sieve log-likelihood, instead of analytically

deriving the ﬁrst and second order derivatives, we propose to use the Richardson’s extrapolation

(Lindﬁeld and Penny, 1989) to approximate the score function and observed information ma-

trix numerically. As shown in our simulations, the proposed procedure guarantees almost 100%

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

11

convergence and the computing speed is notably improved by using initial values from step 1.

3.3 Asymptotic properties of sieve estimators

This section presents asymptotic properties of the sieve maximum likelihood estimators ˆθn with

regularity conditions and proofs being supplied in Appendix D of the Supplementary Materials.

Denote P as the true probability measure and Pn as the empirical measure for n independent

subjects. Let |v| be the Euclidean norm for a vector v. Deﬁne the supremum norm (cid:107)f (cid:107)∞ =

supt|f (t)| for a function f (t). Also deﬁne (cid:107)f (cid:107)L2(P ) = ((cid:82) |f |2dP )1/2 for a function f under the
2 = (cid:82) [{Λj(l)}2 +

probability measure P . In particular, the L2(P ) norm for Λj is deﬁned as (cid:107)Λj(cid:107)2

{Λj(r)}2]dFj(l, r), where Fj(l, r) denotes the joint cumulative distribution function of Lij and

Rij (i = 1, ..., n; j = 1, 2). Finally, we deﬁne the distance between θ1 = (βT

1 , α1, κ1, Λ11, Λ21)T ∈ Θ

and θ2 = (βT

2 , α2, κ2, Λ12, Λ22)T ∈ Θ as

d(θ1, θ2) = (|β1 − β2|2 + |α1 − α2|2 + |κ1 − κ2|2 + (cid:107)Λ11 − Λ12(cid:107)2

2 + (cid:107)Λ21 − Λ22(cid:107)2

2)1/2.

Let θ0 = (βT

0 , α0, κ0, Λ10, Λ20)T denote the true value of θ ∈ Θ. The following theorems present

the convergence rate, asymptotic normality, and eﬃciency of the sieve estimators.

Theorem 3.1 (Convergence rate) Assume that Conditions 1-2 and 4-5 in Appendix D of the

Supplementary Materials hold. Let mn = o(nν), where ν ∈ (0, 1) and q be the smoothness

parameter of Λj as deﬁned in Condition 4, then we have

d(ˆθn, θ0) = Op

(cid:0)n− min{qν/2,(1−ν)/2}(cid:1).

Theorem 3.1 states that the sieve estimator ˆθn has a polynomial convergence rate. Although

this overall convergence rate is lower than n−1/2, the following normality theorem states that the

proposed estimators of the ﬁnite-dimensional parameters (β, α, κ) are asymptotically normal and

semiparametrically eﬃcient.

12

T. SUN and Y. DING

Theorem 3.2 (Asymptotic normality and eﬃciency) Suppose Conditions 1-5 in Appendix D

hold. Deﬁne ˆbn = ( ˆβT

n , ˆαn, ˆκn)T and b0 = (βT

0 , α0, κ0)T . If 1/(2 + q) < ν < 1/2, then

n1/2(ˆbn − b0) = I −1(b0)n1/2Pnl∗(b0, Λ10, Λ20; D) + op(1) →d N {0, I −1(b0)},

where I(b0) = P l∗(b0, Λ10, Λ20; D)⊗2 and l∗(b0, Λ10, Λ20; D) is the eﬃcient score function deﬁned

in the proof. Therefore, ˆbn is asymptotically normal and eﬃcient.

3.4 Generalized score test

We now separate β into two parts: βg and βng, where βg is the parameter set of interest for

hypothesis testing and βng denotes the rest of the regression coeﬃcients. The likelihood-based

tests such as the Wald, score, and likelihood-ratio tests can be constructed to test βg, and they

are asymptotically equivalent. In our motivating study, we aim to perform a GWAS on AMD

progression, which contains testing millions of SNPs one-by-one. Therefore, computing speed is

critical. We propose to use the generalized score test. One big advantage of the score test in a

GWAS setting is, one only needs to estimate the unknown parameters once under the null model

without any SNP (i.e., βg = 0), since the non-genetic risk factors are the same no matter which

SNP is being tested. Therefore, the score test is faster as compared to the Wald and likelihood

ratio tests. Moreover, the Wald or likelihood ratio test needs to estimate parameters under each

alternative hypothesis (a total of 6 millions in our real data application), which may fail when

the estimation procedure fails to converge.

With the sieve joint likelihood, we can obtain the restricted sieve maximum likelihood estima-

tors under H0 (βg = 0 and the rest parameters are arbitrary), and then calculate the generalized

score test statistic as deﬁned in Cox and Hinkley (1979). Similar to our estimation procedure, we

also propose to use Richardson’s extrapolation to numerically approximate the ﬁrst and second

order derivatives when calculating the score test statistic.

4. Simulation study

We ﬁrst evaluated the parameter estimation of our proposed two-parameter copula sieve model

(i.e., its transformation margins are approximated by sieves) for bivariate data under general

interval censoring. Then we assessed the type-I error control, and power performance of the

proposed generalized score test. We also evaluated the accuracy in estimating the joint survival

probability using our proposed method. Finally, we evaluated the computing speed and conver-

gence rate of our proposed method.

4.1 Generating bivariate interval-censored times

The data were generated from various Archimedean copula models (i.e., Clayton, Frank, Ali–

Mikhail–Hap (AMH) and Joe) with Loglogistic margins. We ﬁrst generated bivariate true event

times Tij using the conditioning approach described in Sun and others (2019). To obtain interval-

censored data, we followed the censoring procedure in Kiani and Arasan (2012), which ﬁts the

study design of AREDS data. Explicitly, we assumed each subject was assessed for K times with

the length between two adjacent assessment times following an Exponential distribution. In the

end, for each subject i, Lij was deﬁned as the last assessment time before Tij and Rij was the ﬁrst

assessment time after Tij. The overall right-censoring rate is set to be 25%. For the dependence

strength between margins, we set Kendall’s τ at 0.2 or 0.6, indicating weak or strong dependence.

We assumed that the two event times share a common baseline distribution, for example, PO

model with Loglogistic baseline hazards function (scale λ = 1 and shape k = 2) or PH model

with Weibull baseline hazards function (scale λ = 0.1 and shape k = 2).

We included both genetic and non-genetic covariates in the simulations. Speciﬁcally, each

SNP, coded as 0 or 1 or 2, was generated from a multinomial distribution with probabilities

{(1 − p)2, 2p(1 − p), p2}, where p = 40% or 5% is the minor allele frequency (MAF). We also

included a margin-speciﬁc continuous variable, generated from N (6, 22), and a subject-speciﬁc

14

T. SUN and Y. DING

binary variable, generated from Bernoulli (p = 0.5).

Under all scenarios, the sample size was set as N = 500. For simplicity, we assumed the

same covariate eﬀects for two margins, denoted as (βng1, βng2, βg), where βng1 and βng2 are

marginal- and subject-speciﬁc non-genetic eﬀects, respectively, and βg is the SNP eﬀect. We set

βng1 = βng2 = 0.1. For estimation performance evaluation, we let βg = 0 and replicated 1,000

times. For type-I error control evaluation of testing βg = 0, we replicated 100,000 times and

evaluated at various tail levels: 0.05, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively. For power evaluation,

we replicated 1,000 times under each SNP eﬀect size, where a range of βg’s were selected to

represent weak to strong SNP eﬀects.

4.2 Simulation-I: parameter estimation

In this section, we evaluated the estimation performance of our proposed method under both

correct and misspeciﬁed settings. For the margins, we used the true linear transformation function.

We assumed the same Bernstein coeﬃcients φ1k = φ2k with degree mn = 3 (k = 0, 1, 2, 3) for

both Λ1 and Λ2. For the event time range [c, u], we chose c = 0 and set u as the largest value of

all {Lij, Rij} plus a constant.

In Table 1(a), the true model is Clayton copula with Loglogistic (PO) or Weibull (PH) mar-

gins, under Kendall’s τ = 0.6. We ﬁtted three models: the true copula model with parametric

margins (i.e., Clayton copula with Loglogistic or Weibull margins, denoted as “Clayton-PM”), a

two-parameter copula sieve model (“Copula2-S”) and a marginal sieve model (i.e., the marginal

transformation model approximated by sieves) where the variance-covariance is estimated by

the robust sandwich estimator (“Marginal-S”) (a model also used in Zhou and others, 2017).

We obtained estimation biases and 95% coverage probabilities for regression coeﬃcients and

dependence parameters. Under the two-parameter copula model, the sieve maximum likelihood

estimators are all virtually unbiased, and all empirical coverage probabilities are close to the nom-

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

15

inal level. Moreover, their standard errors are virtually the same as the standard errors under the

true parametric model, indicating our proposed method works well. For the robust marginal sieve

model, the regression coeﬃcient estimates are also unbiased with correct coverage probabilities,

but their standard errors are apparently larger.

We further evaluated the estimation performance of the proposed model on bivariate interval-

censored data generated from copula models that do not belong to the two-parameter copula

family, such as Frank copula with τ = 0.6, AMH copula with τ = 0.2 (τ is always < 1

3 for AMH

copula) and Joe copula with τ = 0.6. In Table 1(b), the regression coeﬃcient estimates from the

two-parameter copula are all unbiased with coverage probabilities close to 95%. The biases for

the τ estimates are also minimal with good coverage probabilities except in the scenario when

data were generated from a Joe copula (coverage probability = 83%). Overall, the two-parameter

copula model family demonstrates good robustness to misspeciﬁcation in copula functions.

In the real setting, the value of the transformation function parameter r is often unknown.

Therefore, we examined our methods in estimating the transformation function parameter r

together with the other parameters in our proposed model. The results are presented in the

Table 1 of Appendix A in the Supplementary Materials, which shows satisfactory estimation

performance for all parameters including the transformation parameter.

4.3 Simulation-II, generalized score test performance

We evaluated the type-I error control of our proposed generalized score test under Copula2-S.

Speciﬁcally, we tested the SNP eﬀect βg under diﬀerent dependence strengths (Kendall’s τ =

0.6, 0.2) and two diﬀerent MAFs (40%, 5%). The true model is Clayton copula with Loglogistic

margins. We included score tests of two misspeciﬁed copula models, one with misspeciﬁed margins

but correct copula (i.e., Clayton copula with Weibull margins) and the other with misspeciﬁed

copula but correct margins (i.e., Gumbel copula with Loglogistic margins). We also included

16

T. SUN and Y. DING

the score test under the correct parametric copula model (i.e., Clayton copula with Loglogistic

margins), which served as the benchmark model. Besides, we examined Wald tests from the

marginal Loglogistic model with variance-covariance either from the independence estimate (i.e.,

the naive estimate assuming two margins are independent) or the robust sandwich estimate (i.e.,

accounting for the correlation between two margins).

Table 2 shows type I errors under diﬀerent tail levels. In the top part where Kendall’s τ = 0.6,

our proposed score test controls type-I errors as well as the correct parametric model at all tail

levels and MAFs. However, type-I errors in the two misspeciﬁed copula models are inﬂated at all

scenarios, especially when margins are wrong at MAF = 40%. It is not surprising to observe the

greatest inﬂation occurs with the marginal approach under the independence assumption. After

applying the robust variance-covariance estimate, the type-I errors are controlled at MAF = 40%

but still slightly inﬂated at MAF = 5%. When Kendall’s τ = 0.2, the proposed two-parameter

model still performs as well as the correct parametric model and outperforms the other models,

although the type-I error inﬂations from other models were smaller due to the weaker dependence.

We also compared the power performance between the score test under our Copula2-S model

and score tests from two other models: the true parametric copula model and the Marginal-S

model. Figure 1 presents the power curves of these three tests over a range of SNP eﬀect sizes.

Our proposed model yields the similar power performance as the true parametric model and is

considerably more potent than the robust marginal sieve model.

4.4 Simulation-III: joint survival probability estimation performance

In addition, we evaluated the accuracy for estimating joint survival probabilities under our pro-

posed Copula2-S model. We generated data from the Clayton copula with Weibull margins, and

ﬁtted the Clayton-Weibull (“Clayton-WB”) and Copula2-S models and obtained the average es-

timated joint survival probabilities P r(T1 > t, T2 > t|Z1, Z2) on a sequence of pre-speciﬁed time

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

17

points given covariate values. The number of replications is 1, 000. In Appendix A of the Sup-

plementary Materials, Figure S1 illustrates that Copula2-S produced an almost identical joint

survival proﬁle as Clayton-WB. In addition, we quantiﬁed the estimation error between the es-

timated and true joint survival probabilities by the mean square errors (MSE) averaged over

all time points and replications, which are 0.0004 (sd = 0.0012) and 0.0003 (sd = 0.0005) for

Copula2-S and Clayton-WB, respectively, indicating the probabilities are well estimated.

4.5 Simulation-IV, convergence and computing speed

We examined the computational advantages of our proposed two-step sieve estimation procedure

as compared to the one-step estimation approach (i.e., directly maximizes the joint likelihood with

arbitrary initial values). Data were simulated from a Clayton copula with Loglogistic margins. For

1, 000 replications, the one-step procedure took 1, 260 seconds while our proposed procedure took

925 seconds, saving about 27% computing time. For convergence rate, the proposed procedure

failed in 0.1% times, whereas the one-step procedure failed in 1.6% times.

We also compared the computing speed of three likelihood-based tests on testing 1, 000 SNPs

under three models: the true Clayton model with Loglogistic margins, our proposed Copula2-S

model and the Marginal-S model. The 1,000 genetic variants were simulated from MAF = 40%.

The results are shown in Table S3 in the Appendix A from the Supplementary Materials. We

found that the score test is about 3-5 times faster than the Wald test or the likelihood ratio test

on average. Within the three score tests, although the score test under our Copula2-S model is the

slowest due to model complexity, it is still faster than the Wald test under the Marginal-S model.

Given its advantages in robustness, type-I error control, and power performance, we recommend

the proposed Copula2-S model with the score test for the large-scale testing case.

5. Real data analysis

We implemented our proposed method to analyze the AREDS data. AREDS was designed to

assess the clinical course of, and risk factors for the development and progression of AMD. DNA

samples were collected from the consenting participants and genotyped by the International AMD

Genomics Consortium (Fritsche and others, 2016). In this study, each participant was examined

every six months in the ﬁrst six years and then every year after year six. To measure the disease

progression, a severity score, scaled from one to twelve (with a more signiﬁcant value indicating

more severe AMD), was determined for each eye of each participant at every examination. The

outcome of interest is the bivariate progression time-to-late-AMD, where late-AMD is deﬁned as

the stage with severity score (cid:62) 9. Both phenotype and genotype data of AREDS are available from

the online repository dbGap (accession: phs000001.v3.p1, and phs001039.v1.p1, respectively). By

far, all the studies that analyzed the AREDS data for AMD progression treated the outcome as

right-censored (e.g., Ding and others (2017), Yan and others (2018), and Sun and others (2019)),

and some only used data from the worst eye in each subject (e.g., Seddon and others (2014)).

We analyzed 2,718 Caucasian participants, including 2,295 subjects who were free of late-

AMD in both eyes at the enrollment, i.e., time 0 (bivariate data indicated as group A), and

423 subjects who had one eye already progressed to late-AMD by enrollment (univariate data

indicated as group B). For the jth eye (free of late-AMD at time 0) of subject i, we observe Lij,

the last assessment time when the jth eye was still free of late-AMD and Rij, the ﬁrst assessment

time when the jth eye was already diagnosed as late-AMD. For the eye that did not progress

to late-AMD by the end of the study follow-up, we assigned a large number to Rij. Since there

are two groups of subjects (group A and B), we implemented a two-part model. Speciﬁcally, we

created a covariate for each eye to indicate whether its fellow eye had already progressed or not

at time 0 (i.e., 0 for both eyes of group A subjects and 1 for group B subjects). Then the joint

likelihood is the product of the copula sieve model for group A subjects and the marginal sieve

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

19

model for group B subjects. In addition, we performed a secondary sensitivity analysis using

only group A subjects and obtained similar top SNPs as from the two-part model (Table S4 of

Appendix B in the Supplementary Materials).

We included four risk factors as non-genetic covariates, including the baseline age, severity

score, smoking status, and fellow-eye progression status. We checked various combinations of

transformation functions (i.e., g(x) = x for PH model and g(x) = log(1 + x) for PO model) and

Bernstein polynomial degrees mn (from 3 to 6). We chose the model that produced the smallest

aic, which is the PO model (i.e., g(x) = log(1 + x)) with mn = 4 for both margins. The aic

results are summarized in Table S5 of Appendix B in the Supplementary Materials.

We performed GWAS on 6 million SNPs (either from exome chip or imputed) with MAF > 5%

across the 22 autosomal chromosomes and plotted their − log(p) in Figure S2 in the Appendix B

of the Supplementary Materials. As highlighted in the ﬁgure, the PLEKHA1–ARMS2–HTRA1

region on chromosome 10 and the CFH region on chromosome 1 have variants reaching the

“genome-wide” signiﬁcance level (p < 5 × 10−8). Previously, these two regions were found being

signiﬁcantly associated with AMD onset from multiple case-control studies (Fritsche and others,

2016). Moreover, we identiﬁed SNPs in a previously unrecognized ATF7IP2 region on chromo-

some 16, showing moderate to strong association with AMD progression (5×10−8 < p < 1×10−5).

As a comparison, we also ﬁtted the robust marginal sieve model (Marginal-S) and the Gamma

frailty sieve model (Frailty-S) (Zhou and others, 2017), and performed the corresponding score

tests for each SNP. Overall, their results are consistent with our Copula2-S model, but the p-

values are generally larger (as shown in Table 3). Note that the CFH region did not reach the

“genome-wide” signiﬁcance level under the Marginal-S model.

Table 3 presents the top signiﬁcant variants of the three regions denoted in Figure S2. Besides

Copula2-S, we also present score test p-values from Frailty-S and Marginal-S. The odds ratio

of an SNP was calculated by ﬁtting a Copula2-S model including this SNP and those non-

20

T. SUN and Y. DING

genetic factors. For example, rs2284665, a known AMD risk variant from HTRA1 region, has

an estimated odds ratio of 1.66 (95% CI = [1.46, 1.89]), which implies its minor allele has a

“harmful” eﬀect on AMD progression. Under this model, the estimated dependence parameters

are ˆα = 0.90 and ˆκ = 1.00, corresponding to ˆτ = 0.40, which indicates moderate dependence in

AMD progression between two eyes.

For variant rs2284665, we obtained both estimated joint and conditional survival functions

from the ﬁtted Copula2-S model. The left panel of Figure 2 plots the joint progression-free

probability contours for subjects who are smokers with the same age (= 68.6) and AMD severity

score (= 3.0 for both eyes) but diﬀerent genotypes of rs2284665. The right panel of Figure 2

plots the corresponding conditional progression-free probability of remaining years (after year 5)

for one eye, given its fellow eye has progressed by year 5. It is clearly seen that in both plots,

the three genotype groups are well separated, with the GG group having the largest progression-

free probabilities. These estimated progression-free probabilities provide valuable information to

characterize or predict the progression proﬁles for AMD patients with diﬀerent characteristics.

6. Conclusion and Discussion

We proposed a ﬂexible copula-based semiparametric transformation model for analyzing and

testing bivariate (general) interval-censored data. Unlike the approach proposed by Hu and others

(2017), which approximated the copula function by sieves, our approach kept the copula function

in its parametric form but ﬂexibly modeled the margins through semiparametric transformation

models. In this way, our method guaranteed to produce consistent estimates for both regression

and copula parameters, which then led to reliable joint distribution estimates. On the other hand,

Hu and others (2017) focused on estimating regression parameters only but with possible biased

estimates for the copula function. Our proposed method has the great advantage in computation

and it is applicable to analyze large data sets and to perform a large number of tests. All the

Copula semiparametric model for bivariate interval-censored data

21

methods have been built into an R package {CopulaCenR}, which includes a variety of copula

functions (e.g., Copula2, Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, AMH) and is available on CRAN at

https://cran.r-project.org/package=CopulaCenR. The key R codes for this article can be found

at https://github.com/yingding99/Copula2S.

Several model selection procedures have been proposed for copula-based methods. For exam-

ple, the AIC is widely used for model selection purpose in copula models. Wang and Wells (2000)

proposed a model selection procedure based on the nonparametric estimation of the bivariate joint

survival function within Archimedean copulas. For model diagnostics, Chen and others (2010)

proposed a penalized pseudo-likelihood ratio test for copula models in complete data. Recently,

Zhang and others (2016) developed a goodness-of-ﬁt test for copula models using the pseudo

in-and-out-of-sample method. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing goodness-of-ﬁt

test for copula models of bivariate interval-censored data. In our real data analysis, we used AIC

to guide the model selection for simplicity. However, a formal test for goodness-of-ﬁt is desirable,

especially for bivariate interval-censored data under the regression setting. It is worthwhile to

investigate it as a future research direction.

We applied our method to a GWAS of AMD progression and successfully identiﬁed variants

from two known AMD risk regions (CFH on chromosome 1 and PLEKHA1–ARMS2–HTRA1

on chromosome 10) being signiﬁcantly associated with AMD progression. Moreover, we also

discovered variants from a region (ATF7IP2 on chromosome 16), which has not been reported

before, showing moderate to strong association with AMD progression. On the contrary, we found

that some known AMD risk loci (e.g., rs12357257 from ARHGAP21 on chromosome 10, p = 0.12)

are not associated with AMD progression. Therefore, the variants associated with risks of having

AMD may not be necessarily associated with the disease progression; while some variants may

be only associated with AMD progression but not with the disease onset. Our work is the ﬁrst

research on AMD progression which adopts a solid statistical model that appropriately handles

22

bivariate interval-censored data. Our ﬁndings provided new insights into the genetic causes on

AMD progression, which are critical for establishing novel and reliable predictive models of AMD

progression to identify high-risk patients at an early stage accurately. Our proposed method

applies to general bilateral diseases and complex diseases with co-primary endpoints.

Table 2: Type-I error for the genetic eﬀect βg at various tail levels. Six models were compared:
independent marginal Loglogistic model (Indep-LL), robust marginal Loglogistic model (Robust-
LL), Clayton copula with Weibull margins (Clayton-W), Gumbel copula with Loglogistic margins
(Gumbel-LL), two-parameter copula with transformation margins being approximated by sieves
(Copula2-S) and the true Clayton copula and Loglogistic margins (Clayton-LL).
