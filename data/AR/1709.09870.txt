ABSTRACT
We study magnetic ﬁeld evolution in AR12371 relating its successive eruptive nature. During
the disk transit of seven days, the AR launched four sequential fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
associated with long duration M-class ﬂares. Morphological study delineates a pre-eruptive coronal
sigmoid structure above the polarity inversion line (PIL) similar to Moore et al study. Velocity ﬁeld
derived from tracked magnetograms indicates persistent shear and converging motions of polarity
regions about the PIL. While these shear motions continue, the crossed arms of two sigmoid elbows
are being brought to interaction by converging motions at the middle of PIL, initiating tether-cutting
reconnection of ﬁeld lines and the onset of CME explosion. The successive CMEs are explained
by a cyclic process of magnetic energy storage and release terming “sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid”
transformation driven by photospheric ﬂux motions. Further, the continued shear motions inject
helicity ﬂux of dominant negative sign, which contributes to core ﬁeld twist and its energy by building
a twisted ﬂux rope (FR). After a limiting value, the excess coronal helicity is expelled by bodily
ejection of the FR initiated by some instability as realized by intermittent CMEs. This AR is in
contrast to the conﬁned AR12192 with predominant negative signed larger helicity ﬂux but very
weaker (-0.02turns) normalised coronal helicity content. While predominant signed helicity ﬂux is a
requirement for CME eruption, our study suggests the magnetic ﬂux normalized helicity ﬂux as a
necessary condition accommodating the role of background ﬂux and appeals a further study of large
sample of ARs.

1. INTRODUCTION
Triggering of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have
mostly concentrated on the problem of evolution of a
magnetic ﬁeld in very tenuous highly conducting plasma
of solar corona (Forbes & Priest 1984; Lin & Forbes 2000;
Lin et al. 2003; Forbes et al. 2006). This evolution is
driven by slow (compared to the Alfven velocity) mo-
tions of the footpoints at the photosphere. When an
active region (AR) emerges, line-of-sight motions in the
early phase and horizontal (includes shear and/or con-
verging and/or proper) motions after rapid emergence
phase dominate (Liu & Schuck 2012; Vemareddy 2015).
To model the eruptive scenario of ARs under a par-
ticular evolving condition of boundary motion, numer-
ical models have been constructed, vis., emerging con-
ditions of motion (Fan & Gibson 2003, 2004; Gibson
et al. 2006; Chatterjee & Fan 2013; Archontis et al. 2014),
shear dominated motions (Antiochos et al. 1999; Amari
et al. 2003a) and converging motions (Amari et al. 2003b,
2010). All of these models are based on observationally
(e.g., Tanaka & Nakagawa 1973; Machado & Moore 1986;
Priest & Forbes 2002; Lin et al. 2003; Tian & Alexander
2008) valid physical concept that the footpoint motions
predominantly contribute to coronal helicity budget to
form a twisted ﬂux rope (FR) during or before its ejec-
tion as CME. Despite this signiﬁcant progress in the past
decade combining observational and numerical model-
ing/simulation eﬀorts, the relation between the energy
build-up process by the ﬂux motions and the initiation

vemareddy@iiap.res.in

of the eruption is still an outstanding question.

As soon as the magnetic system of the AR has reached
a state of suﬃciently adequate energy by these ﬂux
motions, its sudden release requires suitable triggering
mechanism, which has gained signiﬁcant interest in the
past decade. Several ideas have been framed for ex-
plaining the onset mechanism of the eruption (Klimchuk
2001; Forbes et al. 2006; Moore & Sterling 2006).
In-
ternal tether-cutting reconnection in a sheared core ﬁeld
of single bipolar region (Moore & Labonte 1980; Moore
et al. 2001), external tether cutting or breakout recon-
nection of overlying ﬁeld with the low lying core ﬁeld in a
quadrapolar region (Antiochos et al. 1999), ﬂux cancella-
tion (Martin et al. 1985; Martin 1989; Martens & Zwaan
2001), emergence of twisted FR from below the surface
(Leka et al. 1996), and ideal MHD kink/torus instability
(T¨or¨ok et al. 2004; Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006) are few impor-
tant mechanisms proposed to explain observed eruption
process. Due to a wide variety of dynamic processes in
complex ARs, it is diﬃcult to identify a particular trig-
gering mechanism responsible for a given eruption, how-
ever.

Some ARs show rapid succession of CMEs and ﬂares
over a time scale of minutes to hours (Gopalswamy et al.
2005). As the time scale is too small compared to typi-
cal time scale for energy build up in ARs, the rapid suc-
cession of ﬂares and CMEs therefore represents a frag-
mented energy release. The AR 9236 was reported to
produce recurrent CMEs at an average time period of
10 hour (Gopalswamy et al. 2005) and the associated
ﬂares were not long decay events (LDEs). In such cases,

studies also speculate role of preceding CME in creat-
ing the conditions for a subsequent event (Gopalswamy
et al. 2004). However, study of the same AR by Nitta
& Hudson (2001) suggested the emerging magnetic ﬂux
being responsible for repeated CMEs. In contrast, suc-
cessive CMEs also occur from source ARs in a time scale
comparable to energy build up by footpoint motions. A
best example was AR 8038 producing recurrent CMEs in
few days apart. In this decaying AR, studies report that
prolonged ﬂux cancellation by converging motions and
subsequent magnetic gradient increase about the polar-
ity inversion line (PIL) introduced energy build-up in the
AR magnetic system that being erupted to CMEs/ﬂares
(Mathew & Ambastha 2000; Li et al. 2004, 2010). An-
other recent observational report claims the formation
of four successive homologous ﬂux ropes during the evo-
lution of AR 11745 but only last event becomes CME
(Li & Zhang 2013). Further recent reports in AR 11158
suggest that the shear and rotational motions of the ob-
served ﬂuxes played signiﬁcant role in transient activity
with ﬂares and CMEs (Vemareddy et al. 2012a; Sun et al.
2012). A similar study of AR 12158 concludes that the
two successive CME eruptions being triggered by helical
kink-instability under the driving conditions of predomi-
nant sunspot rotation in a time scale of days (Vemareddy
et al. 2016).

ARs with repeated CMEs are not common and even
exist on the disk, simultaneous and uninterrupted photo-
spheric and coronal observations may not available. Be-
cause of this fact not many observational investigations of
successive eruptions from source AR appear in the liter-
ature. Therefore a general understanding on the relation
between nature of surface ﬂux motions and a particular
triggering mechanism of repeated CMEs remains still elu-
sive. Such studies deemed further understanding of the
connection between the magnetic ﬁeld evolution and the
most favoured triggering mechanism for solar eruptions.
This is the prime motivation of the present work on AR
12371 launching successive CMEs on side of the solar
disk. Further, occurrence of homologous CMEs gener-
ally refers to existence of ﬂux rope and its eruption (Li
& Zhang 2013; Vourlidas et al. 2013). Therefore, study-
ing the AR magnetic evolution will throw some light on
the ﬂux rope formation mechanism, in particular dur-
ing or before eruption that in turn decides the nature
of triggering mechanism whether resistive reconnection
related or ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabil-
ity based. These aspects of eruption process have great
importance from the point of space weather prediction.
Investigation of several such AR cases are also useful to
reveal insightful information separating from their non-
erupting counterparts (Sun et al. 2015). In Section 2, we
describe an overview of CME observations, and their ini-
tiation mechanism in Section 3. The associated magnetic
evolution is studied in Section 4 and compared with the
one in AR 12192 in Section 5. We conclude the study
with a discussion on the role of energy/helicity storage
scenario relating the eruptive nature in Section 6.

2. OVERVIEW OF CMES FROM AR 12371
The major source of observational data used in this
study is Solar Dynamics Observatory (Pesnell et al.
2012), which provides full magnetic ﬁeld measurements
and multitude of coronal observations uninterruptedly.

The region of interest is recurrently CME producing AR
12371, which was a pre-emerged region ﬁrst appeared on
the disk at 12◦N on June 16. In Figure 1, we show the
longitudinal extent of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld
of the AR, obtained from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on four diﬀerent days of four
major eruptions. For the convenience of description, we
label the polarity regions according to sign. From these
LOS magnetic ﬁeld observations, the ARs successive pas-
sage reveals presence of leading negative ﬂux (N1) with a
following negative (N2, N3) and positive (P1, P2) ﬂux re-
gions. The inner bipole (N2, N3) is seen with large shear
and converging motion with respect to (P1, P2), and its
ﬂux distribution becomes diﬀused and disintegrated in
successive days, while the leader polarity is increasingly
seperated from the following polarity. Especially, the fol-
lowing negative polarity appears with a light bridge and
splits into N2 and N3 while being in shear motion to-
wards south direction.

The whitelight CME observations are obtained from
Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO,
Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard the Solar Heliospheric
Observatory (SoHO). A summary of major eruptions
took place in this AR and their observational signatures
are given in Table 1. The CME speed is measured in
plane-of-sky and some of these quantities are taken from
LASCO CME catalog, GOES ﬂare catalog. The LASCO
observations of these four CME cases (in each row) are
depicted in Figure 2. CME1 occurred on June 18 when
AR was at 48◦ East longitude from the central meridian,
and emerged on East limb at 17:24 UT in C2 and 18:30
UT in C3 ﬁeld of view (FOV). The CME is catagorised
as fast one from kinematics of leading edge traveling at
a speed of 1305 km/s in the LASCO FOV. This CME
is deﬂected from the sun-earth line since the AR is situ-
ated well away from the disk center. CME2 occured on
June 21 when the AR is at 15◦ East from the central
meridian. It appears from 02:30 UT in C2 and 3:30 UT
in C3 FOV. It is associated with successive M2.0 (01:02
UT), M2.7(02:04 UT) GOES class ﬂares. The CME trav-
els along the sun-earth line at a speed of 1366 km/s in
LASCO FOV. Because the halo CME moves along LOS
direction, this speed very likely represents the CME lat-
eral expansion rate.

CME3 is intiated at 17:30 UT on June 22, when AR
is at 7◦ west of central meridian. It is associated with
M6.5 ﬂare occurred 17:30 UT and headed towards earth
at a projected speed of 1209 km/s. It appears in C2 from
18:30 UT and in C3 from 19:18 UT onwards. CME4 is
initated from 07:30 UT on June 25 when AR was at 42◦
East from central meridian. It is accompanied by a ma-
jor ﬂare of M7.9 triggered at 08:02 UT. Since the AR
was away from disk center, the measured travel speed,
which is 1629 km/s, is subjected to small projection ef-
fect. CME5 occured on June 24, which is relatively minor
event, preceding a C5.6 ﬂare and slow outward motion.
CME6 occured on 1st July when the AR was positioned
away from the west limb on the other side of the disk,
which is classiﬁed as fast having a speed of 1435 km/s.
For reasons of having data with less projection eﬀects,
we analyzed ﬁrst four events in the later sections. To
show the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) dimming, we plot
in the last column of Figure 2, diﬀerence images of AIA

ble dimming, has attracted a lot attention interpreting
that the two dimming regions are the footprints of an
expanding FR still connectted to the Sun and experienc-
ing signiﬁcant density depletion (Thompson et al. 1998;

Webb et al. 2000; Yurchyshyn et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007;
Attrill et al. 2008). This density depletion at the sig-
moid/FR legs causes void of EUV emitting plasma and
creates intensifying dark regions when FR takes oﬀ the

Sun. As marked by arrows, the images clearly show these
dark regions. CME2 show exact symmetric double dim-
ming pattern as lobes of the upward lifting FR. However
in the rest of the events, the dimming is on a side reﬂect-
ing the eﬀect of LOS integration of EUV emission that
the AR being at diﬀerent longitudes away from central
meridian. Although all these dimming cases do not ﬁt
with exact symmetric double dimmings, the observations
demonstrate the FR structure of the CME as we see FR
formation during a self amplifying triggering mechanism
of the CME.

3. INITIATION AND TRIGGERING MECHANISM

OF ERUPTIONS
In all the four CME cases, the initiation mechanism is
similar as they are occuring recurrently from the same
polarity inversion line (PIL) and magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture. Given two competent models of FR (Rust & Ku-
mar 1996; Roussev et al. 2003; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005) and
sheared arcade (Antiochos 1998; Antiochos et al. 1999;
Amari et al. 2003a,b, 2010), the choice is more biased
to the later because the preeruptive morphology in coro-
nal observations is not ﬁt with unambiguous FR topol-
ogy as those generic examples considered in the litera-
ture (Green et al. 2007; Gilbert et al. 2007; Zhang et al.
2012). In this context, a ﬂux rope is deﬁned as a collec-
tion of twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines spiraling around the
same axis by more than one full turn. The sheared ar-
cade is an arcade of ﬁeld lines that runs nearly parallel to
the PIL rather than crossing right over the PIL. The FR
models consider a preexisted twisted FR before eruption,
and is initiated by an ideal MHD instability. A sheared
arcade is the initial conﬁguration in the other model,
which is being build by motions parallel to PIL but oppo-
site in direction at the footpoints. Both the sheared and
twisted ﬁelds are stored energy conﬁgurations with non-
zero magnetic helicity. Sigmoids, ﬁlaments are mostly
considered as precursor features in such conﬁgurations
(Pevtsov et al. 2003; Canﬁeld et al. 1999). In this AR
12371, the preerupive conﬁguration during all CME erup-
tions is a sigmoid as revealed by coronal morphology. Fil-
ament segments are also observed in 304˚A images in some
cases. A key feature of a ﬁlament channel is that it is a re-
gion of dominant horizontal ﬁeld where the ﬁeld on either
side points in the same direction. As a result, ﬁlament
channels are interpreted as locations of strong magnetic
shear and highly non-potential magnetic ﬁelds (Mackay
et al. 2010). The observed sigmoid core is associated
with inner bipole (P1, P2; N2 N3) (inner bipole, from
here onward). As these polarities are seen with large
shear motions (See Figure 1,6) with their disappearing
ﬂux content, the build up of sheared arcade with a cen-
tral core is in evitable (Antiochos et al. 1994; Aulanier
et al. 2002; Antiochos et al. 1999; Amari et al. 2003a)
and is in accordance with the sheared arcade scenario.

In addition to this sheared PIL, the orientation, sep-
arating motion of N1 from follower polarities produce
further stress in the ﬁeld lines of large scale covering
end-to-end polarities, which we expect to build the non-
potential energy in the entire magnetic structure of the
AR. Moreover, a visual inspection of magnetograms gives
an impression of converging motion of (N2, N3) towards
(P1,P3) (see Figure 5), which besides shear motions
played prime role in building the sigmoid and subsquent

eruption. With the above two important supporting
points, we suggest the eruptions are driven by shearing
and converging motion of oppositive polarities. Impor-
tantly, the continuous shear motions also transform the
post eruption arcade (PFA) from the previous eruption
further into sheared arcade to build energy for the next
eruption. Flux convergence and cancellation have been
shown to be important for ﬁlament channel formation ac-
cording to the observations reported by Martin (1998).
Wang & Muglach (2007) argue that the ﬂux cancellation
between opposite polarity elements removes the normal
component of the ﬁeld leaving the component parallel to
the PIL which builds gradually to form the axial ﬁeld
of the ﬁlament channel. Similarly, Amari et al. (2010)
showed that ﬂux cancellation may transform a sheared
arcade into a stable or unstable FR. Mackay & van Balle-
gooijen (2006) showed that ﬂux cancellation at the PIL
between bipoles may result in the formation of a FR,
its elevation and consequence reconnection below it and
subsequent ejection.

In slowly evolving corona, the eruption of the sigmoid
is explained by initiation and trigger mechanisms. They
occur in a time scale of less than an hour or so, far less
than that of build up of the sigmoid. From similar stud-
ies of ARs (Green & Kliem 2009; Green et al. 2011; Ve-
mareddy & Mishra 2015), the mechanism that best ex-
plains the eruptions in our AR 12371 is tether cutting
model (Moore & Labonte 1980; Moore et al. 2001; Moore
& Sterling 2006). In this model, the pre-eruptive sigmoid
consists of a central shear core about PIL and two oppo-
sitely curved loops as magnetic elbows. These two elbow
arms shear past each other along the middle stretch of
the PIL. At some (can be critical) stage, these oppositely
curved elbows also appear as -sections, with a sharp in-
terface between the elbow arms, also called crossed arms,
rooted in opposite polarities about the middle section of
the PIL. When these arms are pushed further against
each other by converging motions, they begin to recon-
nect at the interface. The newly connected ﬁeld lines
exit from the reconnection site in the corona, one set es-
capes upward as twisted FR and the other is downward
release ﬁeld lines as short sheared loops low over PIL.
This process of reconnection occurs explosively. In the
following, we compare the coronal morphology to explain
the details of this triggering model in the observed CME
eruptions.

3.1. Evidence for tether-cutting reconnection
In Figure 3, we plot SDO multiwavelength observations
during the onset of the CME2. The two instrument (AIA
and HMI) observations at diﬀerent times are co-aligned
so as to map the footpoints of coronal loops in magnetic
ﬁeld observations. By the time of this eruption, the AR is
located near disk center, so coronal structure and mag-
netic ﬁeld distribution are less subjected to projection
eﬀects. Compared to previous event, positive polarity
moved down to southward and the sigmoid with two in-
verse J-section loops now, with their crossed legs in the
opposite polarity about the PIL, are more distinctly vis-
ible in AIA 94 snapshots (middle row panels). Note that
we use AIA 94 ˚A observations instead 131 ˚A as in other
events. AIA 304˚A observations show contonuous ﬁla-
ment trace (similar to FR) from N1 through PIL to P1

and is a signature of being supported by the crossings
of L1 and L2. This case is similar to that studied by
Vemareddy et al. (2012b) who considered the ﬁlament
channel as FR and interpreted role of tether-cutting re-
connection in triggering its explosion.

The AIA 94˚A images reveal the initiation of eruption
at 00:45 UT on June 21 with the brightening of loop set
L1. From then, the brightening of L1 increasingly inten-
siﬁes and the distiction between L1 and L2 disappears
by the emergent of forming continuous loop set L3 (FR).
It connects the far ends of L1 and L2 and is a signature
of internal tether-cutting reconnection at the interface of
crossed legs. The FR is seen clearly in composite images
of AIA 131/334/193 as it further develops by run-away
tether-cutting reconnection and expands in height sub-
sequently.

The AIA as well as GOES ﬂux show an interesting two
phase evolution of light curves. We plot light curves of
the AIA 94, 131, 1600, and GOES X-ray ﬂux in Figure 4.
These light curves begin increasing in intensities starting
from 00:50UT reaches a maximimum at 01:40UT and

then they decrease slightly upto 02:00 UT from where
they further increase. In the GOES scale of magnitude,
they are recognised as M2.0 ﬂare at 01:02UT and M2.7
ﬂare at 02:04 UT. We carefully studied the imagery infor-
mation in hot wavelengths and found that the observed
light curves essentially imply FR height proﬁle as soon as
it formed. In the ﬁrst phase, the forming FR L3 reaches
certain height while producing reconnection related heat-
ing in thinning current sheet under it and remains con-
ﬁned to the AR magnetic environment in the decreasing
period of the light curves. Trace of this FR is depicted
with an inverse-S curve in AIA131/193/335 composite
image panel.
Its loss of conﬁnement and full eruption
occurs only in the second phase with the burst of second
phase of internal tether-cutting reconnection (02:04 UT)
producing second set of loops pushing the earlier FR and
unleasing the explosion at 02:25 UT.

As the eruption is taken place in two phases with the
upward released FR lifting oﬀ, new bright low sheared
loops appearing below.
It is worth to mention that
the ﬁlament trace after eruption disappeared from AIA

puting these parameters, we refer to Vemareddy (2015);
Vemareddy et al. (2016); Vemareddy & D´emoulin (2017)
(also see citations therein). For this purpose, we used
HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld observations of AR patch. The
vector magnetic ﬁeld in the AR patch is deduced after a
pipelined procedure of stokes vector inversion and ambi-
guity resolution (Borrero & et al 2011; Hoeksema et al.
2014; Bobra et al. 2014). These disambiguated vector
observations of the AR patch in the native coordinate
system (latitude, longitude) are remapped to disk centre
by cylindrical equal area (CEA) projection method such
that the AR patch center matches the disk center. This
is a spherical transformation accounting the foreshorten-
ing eﬀect and the ﬁnal image of the AR patch appears
as if one is observing directly overhead (Calabretta &
Greisen 2002). The ﬁeld vectors are then transformed to
heliocentric spherical cooardinate system resulting (Br,
Bθ, Bφ) which are provided as hmi.sharp cea 720s data
product. These ﬁeld components ( Br, Bθ, Bφ) in the
Heliocentric spherical coordinate system can be approx-
imated as (Bz, -By, Bx) in the local heliographic Carte-
sian coordinate system (see appendix section in Sun
2013) when the ﬁeld of view is small, which is accept-
able for many studies in the Cartesian coordinates. Note
that Bz is essentially the radial component Br in the
remapped series which we refer as vertical component of
B. To reduce inconsistencies due to measurement errors,
we set a threshold limit of 150G for tranverse ﬁeld com-
ponents and 50 G for Bz component.

Further, any projection method (here CEA) distort
the spherical geometry at some level, basically the area,
shape, direction, distance and scale. For a typical AR
whose size is much smaller than the solar radius, the
diﬀerence that results from applying diﬀerent projection
methods is small. Liu et al. (2014) evaluated the impact
of this diﬀerence that could bring in helicity ﬂux calcu-
lation. The maximum diﬀerence they found is 0.7% at
an average of 0.36%, thus concluding the small impact
of projection method in our computations of diﬀerent
non-potential parameters.

A typical vectormagnetogram is displayed in Figure 5
(top panel). Transeverse ﬁeld vectors (arrows) are plot-
ted on Bz map. Note the sheared PIL exists only in the
inner bipolar region enclosed by cyan rectangle region.
Owing to strong shear in transeverse ﬁeld vectors, the
PIL generally spreads with intense vertical current (Jz)
distribution as shown in the bottom panel. In Figure 6,
at four representative epochs, we plot the velocity ﬁeld
derived from DAVE4VM on Bz map. The FOV covers
only inner bipolar region enclosed by a rectangle in Fig-
ure 5, because it is the region of core ﬁeld of the sigmoid
being built before all CMEs. Vectors indicate the direc-
tion of ﬂux motion within a region of polarity outlined
by contour of Bz (±130 G ). Diﬀerent features move with
diﬀerent velocity at diﬀerent epochs, where the velocity is
spread upto a maximum value of 0.8 km/s consistent with
previous studies of various tracking methods (Mathew &
Ambastha 2000; Li et al. 2004, 2010; Vemareddy et al.
2012b). We normalised magnitude of velocity vectors to
0.5 km/s such that features that move at far less veloc-
ity will be recognised. As is obvious from this plot, the
velocity ﬁeld in negative polarity is coherent with a net
organized ﬂow pattern in ﬁrst phase of evolution, which
reﬂects a net southward motion of negative polarity with

remains conﬁned to coronal environment during decreasing period
of these light curves, which then pushed up by the second phase
reconnection product and then subsquent eruption.

304˚A images and the immediate post eruption arcade
still remain sheared (last two panels in third row). A
further relaxation of PFA continues for an extended pe-
riod upto 5:00UT and becoming less sheared. As seen in
AIA 1600˚A observations, ﬂare ribbons begin appearing
only after second phase of reconnection (01:50 UT on-
wards) and become intensively bright corresponding to
peak (impulsive) phase of the ﬂare at 02:30UT (third row
panels). The ribbon morphology traces inverse-S shape
although brightening is not continuous all along inverse-S
path. Unlike standard 2D ﬂare model (CSHKP), this ob-
served ribbon morphology, instead of two ribbons paral-
lel to PIL, became a debate in several studies (Demoulin
et al. 1996). The issue leads to extension of 2D to 3D
eruptive ﬂare model, linking the legs of erupting FR with
the ﬂare ribbons (Aulanier et al. 2012). In this extended
model, the shape of erupting FR and the sigmoid identi-
ﬁes cospatial ribbon morphology with hook shaped quasi
separatrix layers. Starting from EUV sigmoid conﬁgu-
ration, its transformation through initation, CME, ﬂare
phases is known as “sigmoid to arcade” evolution.

Similarly, we analyzed the EUV observations dur-
ing the onset of CME1, CME3, CME4 for which the
morphology of plasma loops well ﬁt into tether-cutting
model. The corresponding ﬁgures are referred at ftp:

respect to positive polarity.

In the later instances this velocity pattern becomes
converging motion towards positive polarity. We can see
intruding negative polarity into positive polarity (panel
at 18T17:00 UT) and its disappearance in successive pan-
els. Chae et al. (2002, 2004) reported that submerging
opposite polarity are the sites of cancelling magnetic fea-
tures. In addition to these motions, a net northward mo-
tion in the top portion of positive polarity refers a sim-
ilar eﬀect of shearing ﬂux motions. These predominant
shearing and converging motion patterns upto June 23
are consistent with the net declining proﬁles of positive
and negative ﬂux in time. These observations evidence
the persistent shearing and converging motions about the
PIL played prime role in the cancellation of ﬂuxes and
a repeated formation of sigmoid in the corona, as stud-
ied in earlier sections (Martin 1998; Wang & Muglach

2007). Especially, this AR observations are similar to
those found in AR 8038 producing sequential CMEs in
few days apart (Li et al. 2010).

In Figure 7, the time evolution of these parameters (18-
25, June 2015) are plotted against GOES X-ray ﬂux. The
CME associated ﬂares from this AR are prominent from
the background (see Table 1) and their initial timings are
indicated by vertical dotted lines. Obviously, the proﬁle
of the net magnetic ﬂux delineates a gradual decrease in
both polarities during 18 to 23. This is consistent with
the dispersing and disappearing polarities (Figure 1,6).
In the ﬁrst ﬁve days of evolution, the positive (negative)
ﬂux decreased by 8(5) × 1021Mx, contributing to a 24%
net ﬂux decrease. The rate of this decrease (cancellation)
is signiﬁcantly more than that in AR8038 (which is 18%)
in a period of 66hrs (Li et al. 2010). It also represents
underlying faster and eﬀective converging footpoint mo-

tions launching CMEs at lesser time interval than in AR
8038.

The net current (I) from both polarities and αav show
increasing trend till June 21 followed by stable evolu-
tion upto 23 June and then show decreasing nature till
25 June. This increased I refers to increased stress in
the magnetic ﬁeld by shear/twist motions which accounts
in horizontal ﬁeld components and is a signature of AR
eruptive behaviour (Falconer et al. 2002; Schrijver 2009;
Vemareddy et al. 2015). Note that the net current in
north (south) polarity is negative (positive) (see Fig-
ure 5), implying a dominant left hand twist to the ﬁeld
in accordance with the inverse-S sigmoid morphology of
EUV observation as also interpreted in many previous
studies (e.g., Vemareddy et al. 2012a; Vemareddy 2015;
Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017). The last eruption oc-
curred under a rapidly increasing conditions of net cur-
rent, and αav as a likely case due to the intermittent
shear motions at a time scale of 4-8 hours.

The proﬁle of dH/dt

is having a value −40 ×
1037M x2s−1 in early observation period on June 18,
which then decreases to an average value of −5 ×

1037M x2s−1 in the rest of the evolution time. Many
studies found that the helicity ﬂux dominantly comes
from horizontal motions (Vemareddy et al. 2012b; Ve-
mareddy 2015) especially after the rapid emergence
phase of the AR. As the AR is already emerged, therefore
the observed proﬁle of dH/dt indicates the magnitude of
shear motions on the AR magnetic system is strong in
the ﬁrst phase than compared to later part of the evolu-
tion. This eﬀect of strong shear motion in turn aﬀects the
I, αav experiencing increased nature later. The eﬀect of
plasma motions on magnetic ﬁeld observationally recog-
nised only recently especially during unusual patterns of
sunspot rotation, and generally the time evolution proﬁle
of dH/dt correlates many non-potential parameters mea-
sured purely based on magnetic ﬁeld (Vemareddy et al.
2012b,a). In this case, we see a time delay between fast
injection of dH/dt and the subsequent increase of I and
αav, indicating relaxation of magnetic ﬁeld being driven
after plasma motions (Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017).
In Figure 8, we plot the spatial distribution of Gθ

of the AR evolution. By deﬁnition, the dH/dt is the sum-
mation over all the photospheric elementary ﬂux pairs of
their net angular rotation around each other weighted by
Bn.B
n (Berger 1988; Pariat et al. 2005). For example, if
two positive (negative) end points rotate counter clock-
wise (dH/dt > 0) then their net contribution to dH/dt
is negative and consequently the ﬁeld lines above them
become twisted in a left-handed sense. Since the exist-
ing shear motion between opposite polarities about PIL
refers to a net clock-clockwise rotation with respect to
each other, the negative H-ﬂux results at each spatial
point due to weighting factor of opposite polarity prod-
uct Bn.B
n. Here intense signal over positive polarity
signiﬁes a strong shear motion of negative polarity com-
pared to that of positive polarity. The leading polarity
shows only separation motion, so its H-ﬂux distribution
is feeble although negative in sign. Overall, the negative
ﬂux distribution is co-spatial with the sheared core of the
sigmoid. Therefore, the observed dH/dt in conjunction
with AIA observations implies that the helicity ﬂux be-
ing pumped by shear motions is utilised in the repeated
buildup of sheared core sigmoid over the PIL, which then
relaxes through intermittent explosions by formation of
FR and its eruption. We also checked the dH/dt proﬁle
calculated from DAVE (Schuck 2005) method of tracked
velocity ﬁeld of LOS magnetic ﬁeld observations, which
yields an identical evolution trend as DAVE4VM (see
also D´emoulin & Berger 2003; Vemareddy & D´emoulin
2017).

integration of helicity injection rate (H =

dH
dt ∆t ) over
the observation time interval. In the plot, we show nor-
malized helicity by average net magnetic ﬂux (Φ) over
positive and negative polarities. H/Φ2 indicates how
much the magnetic conﬁguration is twisted/sheared, be-
cause for a uniformly twisted ﬂux tube with n turns, the
helicity H is equal to nΦ2, where Φ is its axial ﬂux. From
the time evolution, the AR ﬂux system is twisted signif-
icantly upto 0.15 turns. Note that accumulated helicity
is expelled through CMEs intermittently. Previous AR
studies found a maximum twist of 0.2 turns (D´emoulin
& Pariat 2009; Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017) for highly
twisted ﬂux systems. Corresponding to dH/dt proﬁle,
the energy ﬂux injection dE/dt (a positive deﬁnite quan-
tity always) shows higher rate in the ﬁrst phase (upto
June 21) compared to later part of evolution where it
varies about a mean value of 5 × 1027ergs/s. Assum-
ing an average time of 40 hours between two CMEs,
this average energy injection is suﬃcient to store en-
ergy (7.2 × 1032ergs) required by a fast CME preceded
by M-class ﬂare. The coronal energy budget amounts to
3.9 × 1033ergs, which is a result of purely horizontal ﬂux
motions during the considered time interval. This is as
signiﬁcant as to power the sequential CMEs with M-class
ﬂares and what matters here is how it availed to ejective
eruptions rather slow conﬁned eruptions dissipating as
gradual coronal heating (Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017).

5. COMPARISION WITH THE MAGNETIC

EVOLUTION IN NON-ERUPTIVE AR 12192
Finally, we compared the magnetic evolution in AR
12371 with the largest AR 12192 in the past 24 years.

The AR 12192 crossed the visible disk from 2014 Octo-
ber 17 to 30, unusually producing more than one hun-
dred ﬂares, including 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, but
only one small CME. Being ﬂare rich but surprisingly
CME poor, the AR 12192 had drawn much attention
(Sun et al. 2015; Thalmann et al. 2015) in contrast to the
AR case here. After applying similar methodology, the
magnetic evolution of AR 12192 is plotted in Figure 9.
To be within ±45◦ longitude, we consider the evolution
for seven days between 21-27, during which four X-ﬂares
occurred as shown in the top panel. The ﬁeld distribu-
tion is largely bipolar with leading positive and following
negative ﬂux as shown in panel (a). Note that the mag-
netic evolution exhibits ﬂux emergence from mid of June
24 with increased negative signed helicity ﬂux distribu-
tion in the outer regions of main polarities.

The dH/dt varies about −70 × 1037M x2s−1 till Octo-
ber 25, which is followed by persistent decreasing trend to
zero value corresponding to the increased magnetic ﬂux
content in AR. In contrast to AR 12371 (Figure 7), the
H(t)/Φ2 is very small mounting to 0.02 turns (negative
sign) in the seven day evolution. It is smaller by a factor
8 compared to that in AR 12371, although the net dH/dt
is twice in magnitude. It indicates that the AR 12192 has
large average net ﬂux content which is not part of twisted
or shearing ﬂux system. Note that H(t)/Φ2 can also be
obtained by time integrating normalised dH/dt, which
is a measure of helicity ﬂux injection per unit ﬂux unit
time. It varies about the mean value of 0.1 × 10−5s−1
in AR 12192, 0.25 × 10−5s−1 in AR 12371. The en-
ergy ﬂux dE/dt changes about 30 × 1027 ergs/s, which
is three times larger than that in AR 12371. How-
ever, the normalised dE/dt by net average ﬂux (Φ) are
comparable, 0.25 × 106 ergs/M x/s (average over time),
0.3 × 106 ergs M x−1s−1 in AR 12371, AR 12192 respec-
tively. In total, the net dH/dt, dE/dt are larger in AR
12192 due to its supersize but the normalised coronal he-
licity infers a weakly twisted ﬂux which seems to be the
prime indicator for being CME poor. This inference is
consistent with the results of Sun et al. (2015) suggesting
the weaker non-potentiality and stronger overlying ﬁeld
in AR 12192.

6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
All four CMEs occurred from the same magnetic PIL
during disk passage of the AR12371. Under the same
evolving conditions of magnetic ﬁeld, the sheared core
about the PIL (sigmoid) forms repeatedly in several
hours apart. The observations of coronal morphology im-
plies internal tether cutting reconnection as the sugges-
tive triggering mechanism during all four CMEs, suitably
explaining the pre-cursor brightening, formation of FR
and the eventual eruption. All associated ﬂares are M-
class LDEs (> 4hrs) transforming sheared core sigmoid
to less sheared arcade. The EUV double (symmetric)
dimming, three part CME structure, and fast propaga-
tion speeds in LASCO FOV altogether characterize the
CMEs as homologous events.

Flux motions parallel to PIL in opposite direction are
very primitive to build stress in straddled potential ﬁeld
arcade (Antiochos et al. 1994). The ﬁeld lines near the
PIL become parallel to PIL (sheared core) and those
away from PIL are less sheared envelope. In such a mag-

netic structure, converging motions ignite a slow recon-
nection of ﬁeld lines at the opposite ends of PIL produc-
ing helical ﬁeld lines (Pneuman 1983; van Ballegooijen
& Martens 1989), which in turn manifest a FR. This is
a process associated with ﬂux cancellation and occurs
over several hours to even days. The dips of helical ﬁelds
accommodate the chromospheric material lifting against
gravity and explains the observed dark ﬁlament chan-
nels in EUV 304˚A images, for example in CME2 case
(Figure 3). In the FR models, weakly twisted FRs are
considered as sheared arcades, in the sense that the mag-
netic ﬁeld is dominated by the axial component (Mackay
et al. 2010), which is the case in AR 12371 before all
observed eruptions.

In case highly twisted FR forms from the sheared ar-
cade conﬁguration before the eruption by the above slow
reconnection, there can arise other instabilities like ideal-
kink instability and/or torus instability which play the
role of CME initiation. In fact, all FR models assume an
analogous AR magnetic conﬁguration with pre-formed
FR and observationally recognizing a clear FR topol-
ogy is crucial to disentangle the triggering mechanism
whether reconnection or ideal MHD instability related.
Observational studies (Green et al. 2007; Lynch et al.
2009; Vemareddy et al. 2016) suggest the FR forma-
tion/augmentation from sheared core sigmoid under the
evolving conditions of magnetic ﬂux cancellation. They
also reported the possibility of tether-cutting reconnec-
tion as a triggering mechanism of CME eruption. In our

AR12371, the post ﬂare arcade from previous eruption
becomes strong sheared core sigmoid with two opposite
J-sections by shearing and converging motions and the
FR forms only during the onset of eruption by a self-
amplifying internal tether-cutting reconnection.

The entire magnetic evolution of the AR is better ex-
plained in terms of magnetic energy storage and release
process. Coronal X-ray sigmoid is a stored energy conﬁg-
uration and the most recognized eruptive feature (Can-
ﬁeld et al. 1999; Moore et al. 2001; Green & Kliem 2009).
During the eruption, the sigmoid transforms to a pat-
tern termed “sigmoid-to-arcade indicating coronal struc-
ture changes from a highly sheared to less sheared (or
PFA) magnetic conﬁguration. This reconﬁguration re-
leases the magnetic energy that is being pre-stored in
stressed form by persistent shearing motions as the case
here. After this reconﬁguration, a restore process begins
to convert the PFA again to sheared core sigmoid the so-
called “arcade-to-sigmioid evolution. Depending on the
nature of ﬂux motions, the time scale of energy storage
varies. In AR12371, it is 31(CME1 & CME2), 40(CME2
& CME3), 60hrs (CME3 & CME4) respectively between
successive CMEs. This process of “sigmoid to arcade to
sigmoid continues in a cylce for the repeated formation of
sigmoid and its eruption, observing as successive CMEs
like this AR. Observational study by Li et al. (2010) aslo
indicated this cyclic process in action causing sequential
CMEs from AR 8038.

can also be explained in terms of magnetic helicity. In
our case, the AR coronal magnetic ﬁeld is mainly driven
by continued shear motions, which inject helicity ﬂux
of dominant negative sign (Figure 7). This sheds into
sigmoids sheared core twist and its energy by building a
twisted FR. Note that FR can also form during the onset
of eruption by tether-cutting reconnection. In the case
of pre-formed FR, ideal MHD instability can trigger the
eruption. In either of the cases the sheared core sigmoid,
being the precursor structure in all four studied cases in
AR 12371, is basic structure with a critical amount of
volume helicity. As the coronal ﬁeld can not accommo-
date indeﬁnite amount of helicity, the only way to get
rid of it is to expel into interplanetary space by a CMEs
(Low 1994; Zhang & Low 2005; Zhang 2013). It occurs by
FR bodily ejection initiated by the above said instability.
On the other hand, if the helicity injection is changing
sign over the period of AR evolution, pre-accumulated
helicity of one sign is cancelled by the opposite sign he-
licity ﬂux in later time. This cancellation of coronal he-
licity is manifested by gradual ﬁeld reconﬁguration and
dissipation of energy heating the corona (no FR). Us-
ing HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld observations of emerging
ARs, Vemareddy (2015) reported these two possibilities
of coronal magnetic ﬁeld evolution. He showed three
kinds of AR evolution with a net positive, negative, and
successive injection of positive and negative helicity ﬂux.
The ARs with a predominant sign launch CMEs at some
point of time. However, the AR with successive injection
of opposite helicity exhibits only C-class ﬂaring activity
characterised by delayed enhanced coronal emission with
respect to the time of sign change of helicity ﬂux (Ve-
mareddy & D´emoulin 2017). However, it is yet to see
this theoretical relation of coronal helicity ﬂux and the
eruptive phenomena in several emerging AR cases.

Notably, the predominant sign of helicity ﬂux over time
seems not a only requirement for an AR to be CME pro-
ductive. As shown in Figure 9, the AR 12192 is hav-
ing same sign with large injection of helicity ﬂux over
time but CME poor as a counter case to our AR 12371.
The dE/dt is comparable in both of these conﬁned and
eruptive ARs. Even being predominant sign injection, a
major diﬀerence seen is with H(t)/Φ2 indicating weakly
twisted ﬂux in AR 12192 and which seem to be the indi-
cator of eruptiveness of an AR. Note that H(t)/Φ2 is time

integrated quatity of 1
dH
dt which is helicity ﬂux injection
Φ2
per unit magnetic ﬂux per unit time. A weakly twisted
ﬂux in an AR does not represent a ﬂux rope and it is un-
likely that the magnetic evolution in AR 12192 is in fa-
vor of ﬂux rope formation. This is in agreement with the
study by Jiang et al. (2016) indicating the AR remained
in shared arcade conﬁguration without forming two-J
shape like and escaping ﬂux rope unlike in many sigmoid
ARs, including the one here. Therefore, we propose to
use normalised helicity ﬂux as a measure for AR erup-
tiveness accommodating the role of background ﬂux. Sun
et al. (2015) points that weak non-potentiality and strong
background ﬁeld as the reasons for conﬁned nature of AR
12192. In moderate size ARs, small value of H(t)/Φ2 im-
plies to large ﬂux content unrelated to sheared/twisted
part which can act as overlying ﬂux. Since an eruption
occurs either due to weak overlying ﬁeld or strong ﬂux
rope, higher value of H(t)/Φ2 likely forms a ﬂux rope
with weak overlying ﬂux. In short, a small (larger) value
of H(t)/Φ2 implies weakly (strongly) twisted AR ﬂux
system likely containining dominant overlying (ﬂux rope
related) ﬂux suppressing (favoring) the eruption. How-
ever, the upper limit of H(t)/Φ2 is yet to be evaluated
from a study of statically signiﬁcant AR cases over which
the CMEs are inevitable.

The AR 12371 is a representative for eruptive class
ARs as its couterpart AR 12192 with no CMEs. While
highlighting the favored trigger mechanism under a given
boundary ﬂux motions, our study of magnetic evolu-
tion provides clues for diﬀerentiating eruptive and non-
eruptive ARs in terms of magnetic helicity injection. To
further substantiate the observational results and inter-
pretations, we intend to study the modeling aspect of
the AR magnetic structure and the related topological
aspects.
