ABSTRACT

Solar active regions (ARs) that produce strong ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are known to have a
relatively high non-potentiality and are characterized by δ-sunspots and sheared magnetic structures. In this study,
we conduct a series of ﬂux emergence simulations from the convection zone to the corona and model four types of
active regions that have been observationally suggested to cause strong ﬂares, namely the Spot-Spot, Spot-Satellite,
Quadrupole, and Inter-AR cases. As a result, we conﬁrm that δ-spot formation is due to the complex geometry
and interaction of emerging magnetic ﬁelds, with ﬁnding that the strong-ﬁeld, high-gradient, highly-sheared polarity
inversion line (PIL) is created by the combined eﬀect of the advection, stretching, and compression of magnetic ﬁelds.
We show that free magnetic energy builds up in the form of a current sheet above the PIL. It is also revealed that
photospheric magnetic parameters that predict ﬂare eruptions reﬂect the stored free energy with high accuracy, while
CME-predicting parameters indicate the magnetic relationship between ﬂaring zones and entire ARs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Strong ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the
most catastrophic energy-releasing events in the solar
system, are known to occur in active regions (ARs) in-
cluding sunspots (Priest & Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara
2011). Numerous observations have revealed that com-
plex ARs called “δ-sunspots,” in which the umbrae of
positive and negative polarities share a common penum-
bra, tend to produce powerful ﬂare eruptions (K¨unzel
1960)1. According to statistical studies by Shi & Wang
(1994), Sammis et al. (2000), and Guo et al. (2014),
more than 80% of GOES X-class ﬂares occur in δ-spots.
In such ARs, ﬂare eruptions often occur in sheared mag-
netic structures above polarity inversion lines (PILs).
Many observers have pointed out the importance of
strong-ﬁeld, high-gradient, highly-sheared PILs (e.g.,
Hagyard et al. 1984; Tanaka 1991; Zirin & Wang 1993;
Falconer et al. 2002; Schrijver 2007). Therefore, for un-
derstanding ﬂare eruptions, it is essential to reveal the
formation of δ-spots and such sheared structures and
its relation with the evolution of entire ARs (for further
review see Wang & Liu 2015).

Recently, Toriumi et al. (2017) surveyed all ARs that
produced ≥ M5.0-class events in Solar Cycle 24 (events
within 45◦ from the disk center in 6 yr from May
2010) and classiﬁed them into four categories based
on pioneering work by Zirin & Liggett (1987): see also
Takizawa & Kitai (2015). Figure 1 summarizes the four
categories.

Spot-Spot: A complex, compact δ-spot group,

in
which a large, long sheared PIL extends across the
whole AR. A representative region is NOAA AR
11429, which produced an X5.4-class event along
the central PIL. Takasao et al. (2015) suggested
the possibility that this AR is created through
the emergence of a strongly twisted, kink unsta-
ble ﬂux tube (see also Tanaka 1991; Linton et al.
1996; Fan et al. 1999).

Spot-Satellite: A newly emerging minor bipole ap-
pears in the close vicinity of one of the preexisting
main sunspots and creates a small δ-spot with a
compact PIL between the main and satellite spots.
NOAA 12017, producing an X1.0 event, falls into
this category (Kleint et al. 2015).

Quadrupole: A δ-conﬁguration is formed by the col-
lision of opposite polarities from two emerging

siﬁcation are α (unipole), β (bipole), and γ (multiple spots with
intermixed polarity).

bipoles of comparable size. A typical example is
NOAA 11158, in which a series of strong ﬂares em-
anated from its central PIL (Schrijver et al. 2011).
Toriumi et al. (2014) and Fang & Fan (2015) sug-
gested that this AR is created by the emergence
of a single ﬂux tube that rises at two locations.

Inter-AR: Strong ﬂares produced on the PIL between
two separated, apparently independent ARs.
They show no clear δ-conﬁguration nor a clear
sheared PIL at the ﬂaring sites. The X1.2-class
ﬂare that occurred between NOAA ARs 11944 and
11943 is a representative event of this category. It
produced a very fast CME (∼ 2, 400 km s−1) that
could potentially cause a severe geomagnetic dis-
turbance (M¨ostl et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015).

The creation of non-potential structures such as δ-
spots and sheared PILs is a result of large-scale ﬂux
emergence from the solar interior and eventual sunspot
motions. In this paper, in order to investigate the forma-
tion of the four above-mentioned types of ARs that can
potentially produce ﬂares, CMEs, and perhaps Earth-
aﬀecting disturbances, we conduct a series of ﬂux emer-
gence simulations. While ﬂux emergence occurs as a
result of the dynamo mechanism acting inside the Sun
(Parker 1955), here we focus more on the complexity
and interaction of magnetic ﬂux systems rising in the
interior and the resultant formation of ARs.

Flux emergence simulations from the convection zone
have widely been used to model solar ARs in the last
two decades (e.g., Fan 2001; Archontis et al. 2004;
Cheung et al. 2010; Toriumi & Yokoyama 2011, 2012;
Rempel & Cheung 2014: for review see Cheung & Isobe
2014). In the present work, we test four diﬀerent ﬂux
emergence simulations, including those suggested previ-
ously to model δ-spots (Fan et al. 1999; Toriumi et al.
2014; Fang & Fan 2015; Takasao et al. 2015), using sim-
ilar numerical conditions, and explore, in particular, the
formation of δ-spots with sheared PILs in the surface
layer as well as the buildup of free magnetic energy in
the atmosphere.

Thanks to recent progress in accurate magnetic mea-
surements and high-performance computations, sev-
eral ﬂare and CME prediction methods have been
suggested and developed (e.g., Leka & Barnes 2003;
Schrijver 2007; Welsch et al. 2009; Fisher et al. 2012).
Bobra & Couvidat
(2015) extracted various photo-
spheric parameters from vector magnetograms (SHARP
parameters) and obtained good predictive performance
for ≥ M1.0 ﬂares using a machine learning algorithm.
In this paper, we utilize a series of numerical simula-
tions, which reproduce ﬂaring ARs with non-potential

structures (δ-spots and sheared PILs), to examine why
these photospheric parameters predict ﬂare events that
occur in the corona with higher accuracy.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we describe the numerical setup and assumed
conditions for the four simulation cases. Then, in Sec-
tion 3, the general evolution of the four cases is shown.
Sections 4 and 5 are dedicated to presenting the detailed
development of δ-spots and sheared PILs in the pho-
tosphere and the coronal energy buildup, respectively,
while Section 6 explores the prediction of ﬂares and
CMEs using photospheric parameters. We summarize
and discuss the results in Sections 7 and 8, respectively.

2. NUMERICAL SETUP

2.1. Assumptions and Basic Equations

In this paper, we investigated the emergence of buoy-
ant ﬂux tubes initially set in the convection zone. We
considered a rectangular computational domain with
three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z),
where the z-coordinate increases upward. We solved the
standard set of resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
equations:

(8)

ρT,

p =

kB
m
where ρ denotes the gas density, V velocity vector, p
pressure, B magnetic ﬁeld, c the speed of light, E elec-
tric ﬁeld, and T temperature, while U is the internal
energy per unit mass, I the unit tensor, kB the Boltz-
mann constant, m(= const.) the mean molecular mass,
and g = (0, 0, −g0) = (0, 0, −1/γ) the uniform gravita-
tional acceleration. We assumed the medium to be an
inviscid perfect gas with a speciﬁc heat ratio γ = 5/3.

To make the above equations dimensionless, we in-
troduced the following normalizing units: the pressure
scale height H0 = 170 km for length, the sound speed
Cs0 = 6.8 km s−1 for velocity, τ0 ≡ H0/Cs0 = 25 s for
time, and ρ0 = 1.4 × 10−7 g cm−3 for density, all of
which are typical values in the photosphere. The gas
pressure, temperature, and magnetic ﬁeld strength were
normalized by the combinations of the units above, i.e.,
s0 = 6.3 × 104 dyn cm−2, T0 = mC2
p0 = ρC2
s0/(γkB) =
5, 600 K, and B0 = (ρ0C2

s0)1/2 = 250 G, respectively.

We assumed an anomalous resistivity model with the

2.2. Numerical Conditions and the Reference Case

The initial background atmosphere consisted of three
regions: an adiabatically stratiﬁed convection zone, a
cool isothermal photosphere/chromosphere, and a hot
isothermal corona (see Figure 2). We assumed z/H0 = 0
to be the base height of the photosphere, and the ini-
tial temperature distribution of the convection zone
(z/H0 ≤ 0) was assumed to be

i.e., the ini-
is the adiabatic temperature gradient;
tial temperature proﬁle of the convection zone is adi-
abatic. The temperature distribution of the atmosphere
(z/H0 ≥ 0) was expressed as

where Tcor = 150T0 is the coronal temperature, zcor =
18H0 is the base of the corona, and wtr = 2H0 is the
temperature scale height of the transition region. With
the temperature proﬁle above, the initial pressure and
density proﬁles (Figure 2) were deﬁned by the equation
of static pressure balance:

where r = [(y − ytube)2 + (z − z2
dial distance from the tube axis, (ytube, ztube) the lo-
cation of the tube axis, Rtube the radius, Btube the
magnetic ﬁeld strength at the axis, and q the twist
intensity. As the Reference (typical) case, we consid-
ered (ytube/H0, ztube/H0) = (0, −30), Rtube/H0 = 3,
Btube/B0 = 30, and qH0 = −0.2. The total axial mag-
netic ﬂux amounts to Φtube/(B0H 2
0 ) = 845. These pa-
rameters indicate that the initial ﬂux tube is located at
a depth of 5.1 Mm and has a radius of 510 km; a central
ﬁeld strength of 7.5 kG (or the plasma β ≡ 8πp/B2 ∼
10), which yields an axial ﬂux of 6 × 1019 Mx; and a left-
handed twist. The magnetic pressure, pmag = B2/(8π),
along the vertical axis is shown in Figure 2. The gas
pressure inside the tube was deﬁned as pi = p(z)+ δpexc,
with the pressure excess being

and xtube and λ are the center and the length of the
buoyant section, respectively, and ǫ is a factor that sup-
presses the emergence of both ends of the tube. The
typical values are xtube/H0 = 0, λ/H0 = 8, and ǫ = 0.2.
Depending on the simulation case, some parameters
were modiﬁed as described in the next subsection.

The simulation domain was (−150, −150, −40) ≤
(x/H0, y/H0, z/H0) ≤ (150, 150, 400), resolved by a

512 × 512 × 512 grid. The grid spacings for the
x-, y-, and z-directions were ∆x/H0 = ∆y/H0 =
0.25 for (−20, −20) ≤ (x/H0, y/H0) ≤ (20, 20) and
∆z/H0 = 0.2 for −40 ≤ z/H0 ≤ 15. Outside this
range, the spacings were smoothly increased up to
∆x/H0 = ∆y/H0 = 0.8 and ∆z/H0 = 1.8. We assumed
a periodic boundary condition for the x-direction and
symmetric boundaries for both the y- and z-directions.
The simulation code we used is the same as that used
by Takasao et al. (2015), which is based on the numer-
ical scheme of V¨ogler et al. (2005): 4th-order central
diﬀerences for calculating the spatial derivatives and
the four-step Runge-Kutta scheme for calculating the
temporal derivatives. Artiﬁcial diﬀusivity, proposed by
Rempel et al. (2009), was introduced to stabilize the cal-
culation, while the ∇ · B error was reduced by the iter-
ative hyperbolic divergence cleaning technique based on
the method described in Dedner et al. (2002).

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the magnetogram at
z/H0 = 0 and magnetic ﬁeld lines for the Reference case
(movie is attached to provide detailed evolution). The
whole evolution is consistent with the previous 3D simu-
lations by, e.g., Fan (2001), Archontis et al. (2004), and
Toriumi & Yokoyama (2012): the horizontal ﬂux tube
makes an Ω-shaped arcade, which rises through the con-
vection zone and eventually penetrate the photosphere,
creating a magnetic dome in the corona with bipolar
spots in the photosphere.

2.3. Four Simulation Cases

In order to model the four types of ﬂare-productive
ARs introduced in Section 1, we tested four simulation
cases with initial conditions diﬀerent from those of the
Reference case, which are summarized in the bottom
row of Figure 1.

For the Spot-Spot case, the initial twist strength was
intensiﬁed to qH0 = −0.8, which is larger than the
critical value for the kink instability (|q|H0 = 0.33:
Linton et al. 1996). Due to the stronger initial twist,
the density deﬁcit is larger for this case (Equations (16)
and (17)) and thus the ﬂux tube starts with a faster ris-
ing speed (see, e.g., Murray et al. 2006). At the same
time, the kinking itself accelerates the ﬂux tube: When
the tube kinks, its axis is stretched, which enhances the
buoyancy and makes the rise speed faster (Fan et al.
1999).

The second case, Spot-Satellite, was modeled by in-
troducing a parasitic ﬂux tube set in a direction per-
pendicular to the main ﬂux tube. Perhaps this type
can also be produced from a single ﬂux tube that bi-
furcates. However,
in this paper, for simplicity, we
tested the two-tube scenario (main and parasitic tubes).

Numerical Simulations of Flare-productive Active Regions

The parasitic tube has parameters of Rtube/H0 = 2,
Btube/B0 = 15, and qH0 = −0.2 (directed to +y with
a left-handed twist). The tube center is located at
(x/H0, y/H0, z/H0) = (15, 0, −14) and is kept in me-
chanical balance.
In this model, a periodic boundary
condition was applied in the y-direction.

The Quadrupole ﬂux tube has two buoyant sections
along the axis and thus starts emergence at two loca-
tions. We changed the density perturbation of Equation
(17) to

δρexc = ρ(z)

(cid:19)

,(18)

(cid:21)

where xtube1/H0 = −3λ/H0 = −24 and xtube2/H0 =
3λ/H0 = 24.
Finally,

for the Inter-AR case, we set two ﬂux
tubes in parallel
in the convection zone. The two
tubes have parameters of (xtube1/H0, ytube1/H0) =
(3λ/H0, −3λ/H0) = (24, −24) and (xtube2/H0, ytube2/H0) =
(−3λ/H0, 3λ/H0) = (−24, 24).

In this work, for the purposes of comparing the sim-
ulations to observations, we refer to the emerged re-
gion as δ-spots if it is complex (qualitatively), compact
(separation of the both polarities less than, say, 20H0),
and highly sheared (shear angle of the PIL ∼ 90◦).
Note that we take these values for just a threshold
in the simulations and they are not actually measured
from observations. Also, although previous observations
found that the δ-spots often show rotational motions
and violate Hale’s polarity rule (e.g. Kurokawa 1987;
L´opez Fuentes et al. 2000, 2003), these properties are
not used as the deﬁnition here.

3. GENERAL EVOLUTION

R

Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 are the photospheric magne-
tograms and ﬁeld lines for the Spot-Spot, Spot-Satellite,
Quadrupole, and Inter-AR cases, respectively, while Fig-
ure 8 compares the apex heights, z/H0, as a function
of t/τ0 and the surface total unsigned magnetic ﬂux,
Φ =
|Bz| dx dy, since the ﬂux appears at the surface.
From these diagrams, one can observe that the most
drastic evolution is for the Spot-Spot case, i.e., the emer-
gence of a highly-twisted kink-unstable ﬂux tube. As
explained in detail in earlier works by Fan et al. (1999)
and Takasao et al. (2015), this ﬂux tube quickly devel-
ops a knotted structure in the convection zone rather
than making a simple Ω-shaped arch (see ﬁeld line ren-
dering at t/τ0 = 50), reducing its twist about the axis by
making the axis writhed. It reaches the surface around
t/τ0 = 75 with the orientation of the axis that con-

nects the two main surface polarities highly deviated
from the direction of the original ﬂux tube (see mag-
netogram at t/τ0 = 100); i.e., this AR violates Hale’s
polarity rule. Eventually, at t/τ0 = 300, the magne-
togram shows a pair of circular spots of opposite polar-
ities around (x/H0, y/H0) = (±45, ±5) with extended
tails. An elongated PIL is built in the middle of the do-
main, sandwiched by the two main sunspots. The total
magnetic ﬂux at the surface is more than 10 times the
original axial ﬂux. This is mostly because the original
ﬂux tube has a strong twist and thus a large amount
of azimuthal ﬂux in addition to the axial component,
but this is also because some ﬁeld lines wander up and
down the surface layer, which increases the total un-
signed ﬂux. Since this AR is composed of bipolar spots
with scattered patches and closely-neighboring opposite
polarities, it can be classiﬁed as a βγδ spot.

The remaining three cases show relatively gentle evo-
lutions. For the Spot-Satellite case (Figure 5), the ris-
ing Ω-shaped main tube comes into contact with the
resting parasitic tube at t/τ0 = 150 and starts push-
ing it up. From t/τ0 = 200, the surface magnetogram
shows a separation of the main bipolar spots in the x-
direction, with minor satellite spots separating along the
y-axis at x/H0 ∼ 25 (see green arrows in the magne-
togram). A compact PIL is formed between the negative
main spot and the positive satellite polarity only for a
short period when the positive polarity transits along-
side the negative spot and forms a δ-spot structure. In
the corona, ﬁeld lines of the parasitic tube (green lines in
ﬁeld line rendering) are pushed aside along the positive
x-direction by the main ﬂux tube (yellow lines). Owing
to magnetic reconnection, some green ﬁeld lines trace
the original tube in the convection zone deeper down to
both footpoints. The ﬁnal surface ﬂux is slightly larger
than twice the original axial ﬂux, probably because of
the contribution of the satellite spots (Figure 8). We
conjecture that this AR can also be a βγδ spot.

The two density-deﬁcit sections along the ﬂux tube
of the Quadrupole case create an M-shaped conﬁgu-
ration in the convection zone (Figure 6). The rising
speed in the interior is approximately the same as that
of the Spot-Satellite case. From t/τ0 = 200, the ﬂux
tube creates a pair of bipoles at the surface, and from
t/τ0 = 250, the two central polarities, tightly connected
by the dipped ﬁeld lines beneath the surface, collide
against each other,
forming a closely-packed (δ-like)
sunspot with a clearly deﬁned PIL. The ﬁeld lines show
two expanded magnetic domes in the corona. The ﬁ-
nal surface ﬂux is about four times the original axial
values (Figure 8), which indicates that the ﬂux tube
comes in and out of the surface twice. The above pro-

6

Toriumi & Takasao

cess is in good agreement with previous simulations
(Toriumi et al. 2014; Fang & Fan 2015). Probably this
AR can be categorized as βδ or βγδ.

The two ﬂux tubes of the Inter-AR case follow a sim-
ilar development process (Figure 7). However, since the
two inner polarities are not connected by the subsurface
ﬁeld lines, they have almost no contact with each other
and simply show a ﬂy-by motion. Consequently, a strong
ﬁeld-gradient PIL is not created in this case. The ﬁnal
value of the surface magnetic ﬂux is about four times
the initial axial ﬂux (Figure 8), which is again a behav-
ior similar to the Quadrupole case. The above evolution
is consistent with Case 2 of Toriumi et al. (2014). Con-
trary to the previous cases, the two ARs in this simu-
laiton should be simply regarded as β-spots.

4. FORMATION OF δ-SPOTS AND SHEARED PILS

As discussed in Section 1, sheared magnetic structures
are thought to be important for the production of strong
ﬂare events. In particular, the sheared PIL in a δ-shaped
sunspot is one of the most preferable locations for ﬂare
production. In this section, we show the detailed forma-
tion processes of δ-spots with sheared PILs for the four
simulation cases.

4.1. Spot-Spot

Figure 9 summarizes the detailed photospheric evolu-
tion of the Spot-Spot case. In this case, as the twisted
ﬂux tube emerges, a complex magnetic pattern is formed
in the surface layer and eventually an elongated PIL,
highlighted by the Y -axis, is created at the center be-
tween the sunspot pair, P1 and N1. One prominent fea-
ture here is the counter-streaming shear ﬂow along the
PIL (see V h vector), with its orientation following the
expansion of the magnetic arcades in the atmosphere.
As a result of the shear ﬂow, the horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld becomes highly inclined to the PIL direction (see
Bh vector) and the shear angle becomes almost 90◦ (see
panel (k)). Here, the shear angle is measured from the
direction of the potential ﬁeld (the direction perpendic-
ular to the PIL) and thus 90◦ is parallel to the PIL. The
length of the highly-sheared (∼ 90◦) part along the PIL
is LPIL/H0 ∼ 60.

For easy comparison of the PIL with other simulation
cases and actual observations, we introduce the diameter
of a Reference sunspot. In the Reference case in Section
2.2, the ﬁnal photospheric magnetogram at t/τ0 = 300
shows a simple bipolar pair (Figure 3). We measure the
area of this Reference spot (region with |Bz|/B0 ≥ 0.5)
and deﬁne Dspot as the diameter of the circle with an
area equivalent to the area of this spot. Then, we obtain
Dspot = 24.6, which is used as a normalizing factor for

length scale in Figures 9(k) and (l). With this value,
one can ﬁnd that the length of the highly-sheared PIL
of the Spot-Spot case is as large as LPIL/Dspot = 2.5.

One may also notice that the developed PIL has a
strong horizontal ﬁeld (see panel (i)). Moreover, this
PIL reveals an alternating pattern of positive and neg-
ative polarities (see panels (h) and (l)). These features
are highly reminiscent of the “magnetic channel” struc-
ture, which is introduced by Zirin & Wang (1993) as
one of the key characteristics of the ﬂare-producing PIL
(Kubo et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008). From the compar-
ison with numerical simulations, Kusano et al. (2012)
and Bamba et al. (2013) suggested the possibility that
small-scale ﬂux emergence at the magnetic channel in
NOAA AR 10930 triggers the series of large ﬂare erup-
tions.

4.2. Spot-Satellite

In the Spot-Satellite case, the newly emerging ﬁeld
in close proximity to the main sunspot of the opposite
polarity creates a compact sheared PIL within a δ-spot.
Figure 10 shows that the small bipole P2-N2 appears im-
mediately right of (+x-side of) the main spot N1. The
horizontal ﬂow ﬁeld and the relative motion (middle col-
umn and panel (j)) indicate that, as N1 proceeds to the
right, P2 drifts along the lower edge of (−y-side of) N1
and produces a sheared PIL. Reﬂecting the scale of the
parasitic tube and thus of the satellite spot, the length
of the highly-sheared part of the PIL at t/τ0 = 250 is
only LPIL/H0 ∼ 5 or about 20% of the typical spot di-
ameter, Dspot. Furthermore, in this case, the horizontal
ﬁeld is stronger at the PIL (see panel (f)).

The newly emerging ﬁelds at the edge of preexisting
sunspots have been reported to drive major ﬂares oc-
casionally. For example, Louis et al. (2014) found that
emerging satellite spots ahead of the leading sunspot
of NOAA AR 11515 produce a ﬁlament at the PIL,
which eventually erupts at the onset of the M5.6-class
ﬂare that develops into a CME: compare especially
their Figure 7 and Figure 10 of this paper.
Simi-
lar behaviors have been reported by, e.g., Wang et al.
(1991), Ishii et al. (1998), Schmieder et al. (1994), and
Takasaki et al. (2004), while simulations have shown
that CME eruptions can be triggered by newly emerged
ﬂux at the edges of ARs (e.g. Chen & Shibata 2000).

In this case, as the satellite polarities (P2 and N2)
move away from the main spot (N1), the δ-conﬁguration
and sheared PIL eventually disappear (see t/τ0 = 280
in Figure 10). The δ-spots are only seen in the earliest
phase of the satellite emergence.

4.3. Quadrupole

Numerical Simulations of Flare-productive Active Regions

7

Advected by horizontal ﬂows (middle column of Fig-
ure 11), the two inner sunspots of the Quadrupole case,
N1 and P2, collide with each other at the center of the
simulation domain. The distance between the two spots
show a monotonic decrease (panel (j)) and eventually
a strongly packed δ-spot is created. The highly-sheared
PIL has a length of LPIL/H0 ∼ 15, or LPIL/Dspot ∼ 0.6,
with the strongest Bz gradient (see panel (l)). The hor-
izontal ﬁeld is best enhanced at the central PIL (panel
(i)).

Sun et al. (2012) showed that the Quadrupole AR
NOAA 11158, producing the ﬁrst X-class event in Cy-
cle 24, hosts a highly-sheared PIL between the two col-
liding sunspots (Schrijver et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012;
Toriumi et al. 2013). They pointed out that the PIL
has a strong horizontal ﬁeld, which is in good agree-
ment with the PIL simulated here: compare Figure 5 of
Sun et al. (2012) and Figure 11 of this paper.

4.4. Inter-AR

The ﬁnal case, Inter-AR, does not show the clear for-
mation of a sheared PIL nor a δ-spot (Figure 12). The
two inner sunspots, N1 and P2, remain separated from
each other and simply show a ﬂy-by motion (see panel
(j)). In the central region in the photosphere, the hor-
izontal ﬁeld exhibits a slight indication of a magnetic
shear (panel (g): Y -axis). However, the shear angle and
the Bz gradient are not signiﬁcant (panels (k) and (l)).
As mentioned in Section 1, the X1.2-class ﬂare from
NOAA ARs 11944 and 11943 produced a very fast
CME. M¨ostl et al. (2015) pointed out the importance
of AR magnetic structures in controlling the eruption of
the CME. Although this ﬂare event was not from the
sheared PIL, it produced a fast CME that channeled
through the open magnetic ﬂux created between the two
closed ﬁeld systems, ARs 11944 and 11943.

4.5. Factors That Contribute to the Development of

Sheared PIL

Among the four simulation cases of ﬂare-productive
ARs, we found that the Quadrupole case produces the
highly-sheared PIL with the largest Bz gradient in a well
developed δ-spot. In order to investigate the evolution
of the sheared PIL, we take the Quadrupole case as an
example and plot the terms of the induction equation
in Figure 13. Here we show the shear component of the
photospheric horizontal ﬁeld, BY /B0, i.e., the magnetic
ﬁeld along the Y -axis in Figure 11(g), and each term of

the induction equation,

In Equation (19), we neglect the magnetic diﬀusion and
divide the compression term, −(∇ · V )BY , into the hor-
izontal and vertical components.

It is seen from Figure 13 that the shear ﬁeld BY /B0
appears at t/τ0 = 230, peaks around t/τ0 = 275, and
then gradually decays. During this period, the advec-
tion term is initially dominant (t/τ0 . 260) and, as the
advection weakens, the stretching term increases and be-
comes comparable to the advection term (260 . t/τ0 .
280). For most of the time, the two compression terms
remain negative and do not contribute to the growth
of the shear.
In the ﬁnal phase after BY attains its
peak (t/τ0 & 280), the total value becomes negative and
thus BY decreases. However, the horizontal compression
turns positive and becomes the only term that works to
sustain BY .

The above behavior can be explained in the following
manner. In the Quadrupole case, the sunspots of pos-
itive and negative polarities (N1 and P2 in Figure 11)
approach to the region center and produce a δ-like con-

ﬁguration.
closer, they transport the horizontal ﬁeld from both
sides (see the horizontal ﬁeld vector shown with red ar-
rows in Figure 11). This eﬀect enhances the advection
term in the early phase (Figure 13). Then, after the
two spots merge, they show a drifting motion (N1 to
the right and P2 to the left: yellow arrows in Figure
11), which stretches the horizontal ﬁeld along the PIL,
leading to the enhancement of the stretching term in
the later phase (Figure 13). The compression by the
two approaching spots also becomes stronger. However,
this is only true for the horizontal component (Figure
13). Since the emergence is a process of a nonlinear in-
stability, the rising ﬁeld drastically expands vertically
and ∂Vz/∂z is positive (e.g., Shibata et al. 1989). The
negative contribution of the vertical compression term
in Figure 13 reﬂects this process.

5. MAGNETIC STRUCTURES AND ENERGY

BUILDUP IN THE ATMOSPHERE

5.1. Magnetic Structures

Figure 14 summarizes the 3D magnetic ﬁeld struc-
tures for the four simulation cases. For the Spot-Spot
case, the green magnetic ﬁeld lines, each connecting the

8

Toriumi & Takasao

main spot and the extended tail, approach the center of
the domain from both sides and form an electric current
sheet between them (indicated by an isosurface in the
middle column: see Appendix A for the plotted values).
As a result, the green ﬁeld lines reconnect with each
other and create the purple and yellow ﬁeld lines. The
newly created purple ﬂux system is highly sheared and
aligned almost parallel to the photospheric PIL. How-
ever, this purple ﬂux is trapped by the overlying yellow
ﬂux that connects the two main sunspots.

In the Spot-Satellite case, as the main ﬂux tube (yel-
low) pushes up the parasitic tube (green), magnetic re-
connection occurs between the two ﬂux tubes and the
purple ﬁeld lines are formed. One may ﬁnd that, in the
subsurface layer, the purple ﬁeld lines extend to both
the main and parasitic ﬂux tubes. The current sheet
is developed between the two ﬂux systems immediately
above the sheared PIL in the photosphere. Reﬂecting
the smaller scale of the PIL (Figure 10), the purple ﬂux
is compact and very low-lying compared to the other
cases. Contrary to Spot-Spot, this purple ﬂux is located
at the edge of the AR, and is not trapped by the over-
lying ﬁelds, i.e., exposed to the outer space.

The Quadrupole and Inter-AR cases somewhat resem-
ble each other. As explained in Section 3, the two emerg-
ing ﬂux systems of the Quadrupole case (yellow and
green) originate from the common single ﬂux tube and
thus are connected beneath the surface. Consequently,
the two photospheric polarities show convergence mo-
tion and become tightly packed. Driven by this photo-
spheric motion, magnetic reconnection between the two
coronal loops occurs in the current layer with a sheet-
like shape extending in parallel with the photospheric
PIL. Eventually, the purple ﬂux system is newly cre-
ated, which short-circuits the two inner polarities.

Although the two coronal loops of the Inter-AR case
are not originally connected beneath the surface and,
consequently, the contact of the two ﬂux systems is less
vigorous, they in fact undergo magnetic reconnection in
the atmosphere since the two bipoles expand above the
surface. A vertically extending current sheet is seen in
between. The two bipoles eventually form purple ﬁeld
lines that connect the two independent ARs, which may
be related to the ﬂux rope that erupted as a fast CME
between NOAA 11944 and 11943 (M¨ostl et al. 2015).

5.2. Buildup of Magnetic Energy

In order to examine the accumulation of magnetic en-
ergy in the atmosphere, we calculate the potential mag-
netic ﬁelds from the Bz map at zp/H0 = 2 and measure

the total magnetic energy

Emag =

and free energy

(21)

∆Emag ≡ Emag − Epot.

(22)

Figure 15 compares the time evolutions of Emag, Epot,
and ∆Emag for the four cases. The time ∆t/τ0 is mea-
sured since the ﬂux appears at the photosphere. Here,
the simulation case with the largest energy is the Spot-
Spot case. Reﬂecting the large photospheric ﬂux (Figure
8), it has a total energy and free energy that are about
one order of magnitude greater than those of the other
three cases.

The free energy of the Spot-Satellite case is larger
than that of the Reference case because free energy is
stored in the current layer between the main and par-
asitic tubes in the Spot-Satellite case (see Figure 14,
Spot-Satellite). Since the current sheet lies lower in the
atmosphere, where the density is higher and the recon-
nection is less eﬀective (Section 2.1), the free energy is
not signiﬁcantly consumed and gradually increases over
time.

The free energies of the remaining two cases ex-
hibit an interesting oscillatory behavior. For exam-
ple, Quadrupole shows a big bump around ∆t/τ0 =
50, which corresponds to t/τ0 = 270. This is be-
cause, whereas the potential energy (Epot) follows the
monotonous growth of the photospheric ﬂux (Figure 8),
coronal reconnection between the two magnetic loops
occurs when the two inner polarities approach from
t/τ0 = 240 (Figure 6) and the actual magnetic energy
(Emag) starts reduction, leading to the drastic loss of the
free energy. The free energy decrease of Inter-AR after
∆t/τ0 = 40 (corresponding to t/τ0 = 260) is also due to
the coronal reconnection of the two magnetic systems,
which occurs later than in the Quadrupole case because
the two systems are signiﬁcantly separated from each
other.

The bottom panel of Figure 15 is intended to compare
the four cases under the condition that they have sim-
ilar AR scales. For each simulation case, we normalize
the free energy by the three-halves power of its total un-
signed ﬂux at the ﬁnal stage (t/τ0 = 300), Φ3/2
ﬁnal. Note
that the AR area is approximately proportional to the
total unsigned ﬂux, Φ, because the photospheric ﬁeld

Numerical Simulations of Flare-productive Active Regions

9

is almost uniquely determined by the pressure balance
between the magnetic ﬁeld and the external gas. Con-
sidering that the AR volume is roughly proportional to
the area to the 3/2, here we normalize the free magnetic
energies of the four diﬀerent cases with Φ3/2.

One can ﬁnd that, since the diﬀerence among the four
cases in the bottom panel is less prominent than that in
the middle panel, the free energy depends highly on the
photospheric total ﬂux of each AR (or equivalently area
or volume). However, as seen from the bottom panel,
even for ARs of the similar size scales, the stored free
energy may diﬀer much, up to a factor of ﬁve, depending
on the twist and geometrical conﬁguration of subsurface
emerging ﬁelds.

6. FLARE AND CME PREDICTIONS BASED ON

PHOTOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS

6.1. Flare Predictions

The prediction of ﬂares and CMEs is currently one
of the most important topics of solar-terrestrial physics.
Since the measurement of the photospheric parameters
from vector magnetic data is much easier than the re-
construction of full 3D magnetic ﬁelds, most of the cur-
rent ﬂare prediction schemes are based on such photo-
spheric parameters. After Leka & Barnes (2003) and
Barnes et al. (2007) made use of the vector magne-
togram for ﬂare prediction, Bobra & Couvidat (2015)
extracted various parameters (including those suggested
by Leka & Barnes 2003, Schrijver 2007, and Fisher et al.
2012) from the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram for each
AR (SHARP data: Bobra et al. 2014) and obtained good
predictive performance for ﬂares of ≥ M1.0-class us-
ing a machine learning algorithm. By adding ﬂare his-
tory and ultraviolet observables to the SHARP parame-
ters, Nishizuka et al. (2017) further developed ﬂare pre-
diction models with even higher performance (see also
Muranushi et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2017). The SHARP
parameters used by these authors are summarized in Ta-
ble 1. The F -score (Fisher score) in the table indicates
the scoring of the parameter given by Bobra & Couvidat
(2015).

Then, the question is as follows. Why do some of these
parameters predict the ﬂare eruptions well (indicated by
larger F -scores), while the others do not (smaller F )?
The series of numerical simulations of the present work,
which successfully reproduced a variety of complex, non-
potential conﬁgurations of ﬂare-productive ARs, is one
of the best ways to resolve this mystery. It is worth not-
ing that Guennou et al. (2017) recently examined vari-
ous photospheric parameters using simulations proposed
by Leake et al. (2013, 2014) and found that parameters
related to the PIL are the best to describe the ﬂare oc-

currence. However, their analysis was restricted by the
limited size of ARs and complexity of the simulations,
which could be compensated for by our simulations.

Considering that the ﬂare occurrence is a releasing
process of free magnetic energy stored in the atmo-
sphere, we compare the SHARP parameters in Table
1 and the stored free energy, i.e., the maximum ﬂare en-
ergy that could potentially be released, for the four sim-
ulation cases. The top six panels of Figure 16 show sam-
ples of the comparisons. In each diagram, the horizontal
axis represents a SHARP parameter in question that is
measured at the surface (zp/H0 = 2) every ∆t/τ0 = 2
after the ﬂux appears at the surface, whereas the ver-
tical axis represents the stored free magnetic energy at
each moment (∆Emag/E0, measured directly from the
3D computational domain: see Section 5.2). One can
ﬁnd that some SHARP parameters have strong propor-
tionalities with the free energy (e.g., totusjh and tot-
pod), while others do not (e.g., epsy and epsx). It is
reasonable that parameters such as totusjh (total un-
signed current helicity) show high correlations because
the free energy is stored in the form of electric current.
For each diagram, we compute the correlation coef-
ﬁcient, CC, in a log-log plot, which indicates how ac-
curately a given SHARP parameter reﬂects the stored
free energy, and show it in the bottom right of the dia-
gram. For each plot, we assume each data point to be
independent and simply derive CC from all data points,
regardless of the simulation cases. Therefore, there is
only one CC for each plot. The CC values for all 25
parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The bottom panel of Figure 16 is a scatter plot of ab-
solute correlation, |CC|, vs. F -score for all SHARP pa-
rameters. It is clearly seen that parameters with larger
F yield larger |CC|.
In other words, the SHARP pa-
rameters that are excellent in predicting the ﬂare events
can predict the free energy in the atmosphere very ac-
curately. On the other hand, the smaller-F parame-
ters have weaker to almost no correlation with the free
energy, indicating that they are incapable of predict-
ing the free energy.
It should be noted that, in each
scatter plot, the correlation is strong (weak) because all
four simulations show consistently strong (weak) corre-
lations. For example, |CC| of totpot is 0.95, which is
due to high correlations of the four cases: 0.89 (Spot-
spot), 0.85 (Spot-satellite), 0.82 (Quadrupole), and 0.98
(Inter-AR).

The above relationship between |CC| and F conﬁrms
the suggestion by Welsch et al. (2009) that parameters
strongly associated with the ﬂare activity are extensive
indicated by “E” in Table 1)
(scaling with AR size:

10

Toriumi & Takasao

because the free energy is likely stored on large scales
and non-local.

The even higher prediction rates obtained by Nishizuka et al.

(2017) are probably because, besides adding ﬂare his-
tory, they include ultraviolet observables that are sen-
sitive to chromospheric dynamics such as triggering
processes (preﬂare brightenings) before the ﬂares occur
(see, e.g., Bamba et al. 2013 for detailed observational
analysis of the ﬂare triggers). This suggests that, al-
though the SHARP parameters properly indicate the
accumulation of free energy, this is not suﬃcient to ac-
curately predict the exact occurrence of ﬂares, and we
need additional observables that represent the triggering
of the ﬂares.

6.2. CME Predictions

The rightmost column of Table 1 shows the ranking
of SHARP parameters for predicting CME eruptions,
as reported by Bobra & Ilonidis (2016). Contrary to
the ﬂare prediction case, the parameters that success-
fully predict whether a given ﬂare produces a CME are
mostly intensive (independent of AR size: indicated by
“I” in Table 1), not extensive. One can also see from this
table that they show moderate to weak negative corre-
lations (CC < 0) between the SHARP parameters and
the stored free energy. This is because these parameters
are, in most cases, normalized by the AR size or some
relevant factors. That is, the CME-predictive parame-
ters are not perfectly independent of the AR size; rather,
they have negative dependence with the AR scale.

For example, according to Bobra & Ilonidis (2016),
meangbt is one of the highest-ranking CME param-
eters, and it is the sum of the horizontal magnetic gra-
dient normalized by the SHARP patch pixels N (repre-
senting AR area):

(23)

Since the ﬂare-causing PILs tend to have a high mag-
netic gradient (Section 1), the numerator of Equation
(23) becomes larger for ﬂaring ARs. However, the nor-
malization by area cancels this trend, leading to a neg-
ative correlation with the free energy (CC = −0.530:
Figure 16) and thus a worse ﬂare prediction rate (F =
192.3). Still, this parameter yields a high CME pre-
diction performance. This may also be due to the nor-
malization eﬀect. That is, while the local ﬂaring zone
is characterized by the ﬁeld gradient (numerator), the
global scale of the AR is represented by the AR area
(denominator), and the relationship between the two
factors (their ratio) determines the CME productivity.

The above discussion is further supported by observa-
tional studies. Sun et al. (2015) investigated the ﬂare-
rich but CME-poor AR NOAA 12192 and found that
this AR has a relatively weak non-potentiality with a rel-
atively strong overlying ﬁeld and, thus, the ﬂux ropes fail
to erupt as CMEs. They concluded that CME eruption
is described by the relative measure of non-potentiality
over the restriction of the background ﬁeld. A sta-
tistical analysis by Toriumi et al. (2017) revealed that
CME-less ARs show, on average, smaller Sribbon/Sspot
(ﬂare ribbon area normalized by total sunspot area) and
|Φ|ribbon/|Φ|AR (total unsigned magnetic ﬂux in the rib-
bon normalized by the total unsigned ﬂux of the entire
AR). They argued that the magnetic relation between
the large-scale structure of an AR and the localized ﬂar-
ing domain within it is a key factor determining the
CME eruption. We shall leave the detailed numerical
investigation on the relation for future work.

7. SUMMARY

In this paper, aiming at understanding the creation
of ﬂare-productive ARs, especially the formation pro-
cesses of δ-spots and sheared PILs and the accumula-
tion of free magnetic energy, we performed ﬂux emer-
gence simulations of four typical types of ﬂaring ARs
(Zirin & Liggett 1987; Toriumi et al. 2017). The four
simulations share similar numerical conditions (tube’s
initial axial ﬁeld, background atmosphere, etc.) in or-
der that one can easily compare the results. The main
results of this study are summarized as follows.

The ﬁrst category of the four types of ARs, Spot-Spot,
is modeled by an emergence of a tightly-twisted, kink-
unstable ﬂux tube from the convection zone (Fan et al.
1999; Takasao et al. 2015). Because of the kink insta-
bility, the tube’s ascent is fastest among the four cases.
The ﬂux tube eventually produces a complex AR com-
posed of two main sunspots of both polarities with ex-
tended tails, which is probably classiﬁed as βγδ. As the
main spots develop, an elongated sheared PIL spanning
over the entire AR is created at the center, which shows
a stripe pattern of both polarities that is highly rem-
iniscent of the magnetic channel (Zirin & Wang 1993).
Owing to magnetic reconnection of the two loop sys-
tems, sheared arcade ﬁelds are newly formed above the
central PIL. Although this conﬁguration has no clear ac-
cess to the outer atmosphere, the quadrupolar structure
achieved here (main spots and extended tails) is prefer-
able for CME (e.g. Antiochos et al. 1999; Hirose et al.
2001). This AR possesses the largest unsigned ﬂux in the
photosphere with the largest free energy in the corona.
That is, even if we use the ﬂux tubes with the same axial
ﬂux, the photospheric unsigned ﬂux can diﬀer by up to

Numerical Simulations of Flare-productive Active Regions

11

one order of magnitude depending on the initial twist
and geometry.

The Spot-Satellite AR is achieved by the interaction
of main and parasitic ﬂux tubes. As the parasitic tube
appears at the photosphere in the close vicinity of the
main spot, they form tiny δ-spots at the edge of the
AR with a compact sheared PIL (βγδ spot). The newly
formed ﬁeld lines, created through magnetic reconnec-
tion between the two ﬂux tubes, are clearly exposed to
the upper atmosphere.

The Quadrupole AR is modeled by the emergence
of a single ﬂux tube that rises at two buoyant sec-
tions (Toriumi et al. 2014; Fang & Fan 2015). The two
emerging bipoles collide against each other at the center
and create a strongly packed δ-spot and a sheared PIL
with the highest Bz gradient (classiﬁed as βγ or βγδ).
The coronal free energy shows a ﬂuctuation with time,
coincident with the magnetic reconnection of the two
emerging bipoles.

The two ﬂux tubes of the Inter-AR case, placed in the
convection zone in a parallel fashion, totally separated
from each other, produce two independent ARs on the
solar surface. The two tubes, however, undergo mag-
netic reconnection in the corona as they expand in the
atmosphere, and consequently, a new ﬂux system con-
necting the two ARs is formed. Although they have no
clear sheared PIL nor a δ-spot and thus should be clas-
siﬁed as two simple β-spots, they in fact can produce
X-class ﬂares if the free energy is suﬃciently accumu-
lated, which could launch a fast CME (M¨ostl et al. 2015;
Wang et al. 2015)2.

The sheared PIL in a δ-spot is formed by the com-
bination of diﬀerent factors (Figure 13). The enhance-
ment of the sheared ﬁeld is at ﬁrst due to the advection.
As the spots of opposite polarities come closer to each
other, they transport the horizontal ﬂux to the PIL in
between. Then, the (relative) drifting motion of the
two spots stretches the horizontal ﬂux, and thus, the
shear component grows further. The horizontal com-
pression, which is the pressing motion caused by the
two approaching spots, also contributes to the intensiﬁ-
cation of the horizontal ﬂux.

Some of the SHARP parameters, the photospheric
observables obtained from vector magnetograms, are
known to predict the solar ﬂares with high accuracy
(Bobra & Couvidat 2015). From the δ-spot models of

2 Like other simulation cases, the CME-predictive SHARP pa-
rameters of the Inter-AR case show inversely correlated trends
with the free energy (see e.g. meangbt of Figure 16), which sup-
ports the possibility of CME eruptions from the Inter-AR conﬁg-
uration.

this paper, we conﬁrmed that these parameters reﬂect
the free magnetic energy stored in the corona very well.
Since the free energy is a global (non-local) value, the ex-
tensive parameters, i.e., those scaling with the AR size,
show higher prediction scores (Welsch et al. 2009). For
even better ﬂare forecast, we may need to add parame-
ters that are sensitive to the triggering of the ﬂares, such
as chromospheric brightenings (Nishizuka et al. 2017;
Muranushi et al. 2015).

On the other hand, it was also found that most of the
CME-predictive SHARP parameters (Bobra & Ilonidis
2016) do not reﬂect the coronal free energy well: they
show moderate to lower correlation with the free energy.
These parameters are the values normalized by the AR
size or some relevant factors. This indicates the im-
portance of the magnetic relation between local ﬂaring
zones (e.g. erupting ﬂux rope) and large-scale circum-
stances (e.g. overlying arcades) for CME productivity
(Sun et al. 2015; Toriumi et al. 2017).

8. DISCUSSION

From the numerical simulations, we derived the close
connections among the subsurface history of emerging
ﬂux, the free magnetic energy stored in the atmosphere,
and the various SHARP parameters measured at the
surface. For example, the ﬂare-predictive parameters
are strongly correlated with the free energy (Figure 16),
while the free energy highly depends on the types of
the emerging ﬂux (Figure 15). These relationships ob-
tained in this work provide important information such
as which parameters are suitable, not only for predict-
ing ﬂares and CMEs, but also for probing the subsurface
state of emerging ﬂux that builds up ﬂare-productive
ARs.

Although we revealed the detailed formation of δ-spots
and sheared magnetic structures, how the complexity of
subsurface emerging ﬂux is produced remained unclear.
Recently, Jaeggli & Norton (2016) found that, whereas
the fractions of all α- and β-sunspots remain constant
over solar cycles (roughly 20% and 80%, respectively),
the fraction of complex ARs, appended with γ and/or
δ, increases drastically from less than 10% at solar min-
imum to more than 30% at maximum. From this result,
they suggested the possibility that complex ARs are pro-
duced by the collision of simple ARs around the surface
layer due to the higher frequency of ﬂux emergence dur-
ing solar maximum.

This situation is more in favor of the Spot-Satellite
in which two ﬂux systems interact with each
model,
other in the subsurface region (Fan et al. 1998). Such in-
teraction may be a stochastic process, probably coupled
with convective dynamics. Therefore, we need global dy-

12

namo simulations to investigate how the emerging ﬂuxes
interact with each other and with convection cells (e.g.
Nelson et al. 2014).

Another remaining problem is that we did not observe
any ﬂare eruptions in the simulations. To follow the full
story from the emergence to eruption including free en-
ergy accumulation, current sheet formation, and recon-
nection onset (Manchester et al. 2004; Archontis et al.
2014; Leake et al. 2014), we may need to improve the
model, for example, by tracing an even longer evolu-
tion in a wider simulation domain (see Oi 2017 for
emergence-to-eruption simulation of the Quadrupole
case). Photospheric and subsurface convection may

supply magnetic shear and aﬀect long-term evolution
of magnetic conﬁguration, which should be investigated
further in future (Fang et al. 2012; Chatterjee et al.
2016).

A. VISUALIZATION OF CURRENT SHEETS

From Equation (7), we can roughly estimate the thickness of the current sheet, δ:

In the numerical simulations, the magnetic ﬁeld lines start reconnection when the current thickness becomes comparable
to the grid spacing. If we express the typical grid size as ∆ = min (∆x, ∆y, ∆z), the non-dimensional parameter

approaches unity in the core of the current layer. In Figure 14, we show the region of

Note—For descriptions and formulae of the SHARP parameters, we follow the original notations of Bobra & Couvidat (2015). In the analysis of the
simulation results of this paper, we measured each parameter at the zp/H0 = 2 plane every ∆t/τ0 = 2 after magnetic ﬂux appears at zp/H0 = 2. The
threshold for the absolute ﬁeld strength above which the total and mean values are calculated is selected to be B/B0 = 0.04 (equivalently 10 G), while
the threshold for the “strong ﬁeld” (area acr) and for measuring Schrijver (2007)’s R (r value) is B/B0 = 0.2 (500 G). F -score here is the scoring of the
parameters for predicting solar ﬂares provided by Bobra & Couvidat (2015), while CC is the correlation coeﬃcient obtained from the four simulation
cases by comparing the free magnetic energy and SHARP parameter at each moment (see top panels of Figure 16). Following Welsch et al. (2009), we
classiﬁed the parameters into extensive (E), where a given parameter increases with AR size, and intensive (I), where the parameter is independent of
AR size. The rightmost column shows the ranking of features for predicting CME eruptions, as reported by Bobra & Ilonidis (2016).
