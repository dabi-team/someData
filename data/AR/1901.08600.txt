ABSTRACT
We use integral ﬁeld spectroscopic (IFS) observations from Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrograph-North (GMOS-N) to analyse the ionised gas in the principal star-forming
region in the blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS 1415+437. The IFS data enable us to
map the weak auroral line [O iii] λ4363 at a spatial scale of ∼6.5 pc across a region
of ∼143 × 143 pc2. This in turn allows us to use the robust direct Te-method to map
the ionic and elemental abundances of nitrogen (N) along with the alpha-elements,
oxygen (O), neon (Ne), sulphur (S) and argon (Ar). We utilise these abundances to
map the relative abundances of N, Ne, S and Ar with respect to O. We segment this
predominantly photoionised region of study into elliptical annuli on the basis of the Hα
ﬂux distribution to study the variation of chemical abundances and their ratios, and
ﬁnd no signiﬁcant chemical variation. We also perform chemical abundance analysis
on the integrated spectra of the region under study and elliptical annuli within it. We
ﬁnd that the inferred abundances are in agreement with the median of the abundances
obtained from the chemical abundance maps of the principal star-forming region and
the mapped values within annuli.The ﬁnding has important implications for direct
comparison with high-redshift observations, where spatial resolution is not available,
and for a consistent approach to track chemical evolution across cosmic time.

1 INTRODUCTION

Our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Uni-
verse relies on our knowledge of the origin and distribution
of elements in the nearby and distant Universe. The study
of abundance of oxygen (O) and its distribution is impor-
tant because it is the third most abundant element in the
Universe after hydrogen and helium, and hence acts as a
good proxy to the total metal-content of a star-forming sys-
tem. The abundances of other elements and their relative
abundance with respect to oxygen tell us about the nucle-
osynthetic origin of these elements. For example, α-elements
such as neon (Ne), sulphur (S) and argon (Ar) are thought
to be produced in massive stars along with oxygen (see e.g.
Woosley & Weaver 1995), while nitrogen (N) is thought to
form in massive, as well as intermediate mass stars, though
there have been many debates on its origin (see e.g. Kumari
et al. 2018, and references therein). Various observational
studies have explored the distribution of these elements in
stars and gas within star-forming and quiescent systems

(see e.g. V´ılchez & Iglesias-P´aramo 1998; Henry & Worthey
1999; L´opez-S´anchez et al. 2007; Garc´ıa-Benito et al. 2010;
Monreal-Ibero et al. 2011; Lind et al. 2011; Berg et al. 2013;
L´opez-Hern´andez et al. 2013; Berg et al. 2015). These stud-
ies show that the distribution of chemical abundances may
vary over both small sub-galactic scales or large galactic
scales within galaxies (see e.g. Henry & Worthey 1999; Kew-
ley et al. 2010; Pilkington et al. 2012; James et al. 2015).
The abundance pattern tells us about various constituents
of chemical evolutionary models such as star-formation his-
tory, chemical enrichment, merger events, gas dynamics and
stellar-populations.

Studies of large and small-scale chemical variation have
been revolutionised with the advent of integral ﬁeld spec-
troscopy (IFS) which allows us to derive spatially-resolved
spectroscopic properties of the star-forming systems (P´erez-
Montero et al. 2011; S´anchez et al. 2012; Westmoquette et al.
2013; Kehrig et al. 2013; Ho et al. 2015; Belﬁore et al. 2017).
For example the spectrum of a star-forming galaxy, or an H
ii region, contains a plethora of emission lines. IFS enables us
to map emission lines across the star-forming galaxy, or re-
gion within a galaxy, depending on the ﬁeld-of-view (FOV)

of instruments, and therefore map the physical properties
encoded in those emission lines. This simultaneous obser-
vation in wavelength and space is key to an eﬃcient study
of the distribution of chemical abundances within a star-
forming system (James et al. 2009, 2010, 2013a,b; Lagos
et al. 2012, 2014, 2016; Kumari et al. 2018).

In this paper, we explore small-scale chemical variation
within a blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy SBS1415+437
by using IFS observations obtained from the integral ﬁeld
unit (IFU) installed on the Gemini Multi-Object Spectro-
graph (GMOS; Hook et al. (2004)). This is the ﬁrst ever
IFS study of SBS1415+437, whose general properties are
tabulated in Table 1. SBS1415+437 is a suitable target to
study the small-scale chemical abundance variation for sev-
eral reasons. The oxygen abundance derived previously from
long-slit observations of this galaxy shows that its metallic-
ity is ∼ Z(cid:12)/21 (Guseva et al. 2003; Thuan et al. 1999). Such
a low-metallicity ensures the detection of weak auroral line
such as [O iii] λ4363 with enough signal-to-noise (S/N) to
allow us to map the chemical abundance of various elements
and their ratios via the robust direct Te-method. Moreover,
this galaxy is relatively nearby (∼ 13.6 Mpc), which enables
us to map the variation on scales as small as ∼ 6.5 pc with
the high spatial sampling (0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)) of GMOS-IFU. Though this
galaxy was initially thought to be quite young with the ﬁrst
burst of star-formation occurring in the last 100 Myr (Thuan
et al. 1999), a photometric analysis has shown the presence
of asymptotic giant branch and red giant branch stars which
are at least ∼ 1 Gyr old (Aloisi et al. 2005). Being a BCD
at extremely low-metallicity, this galaxy is a local analogue
of high-redshift galaxies despite hosting older stellar pop-
ulation, and hence a study of chemical distribution within
this galaxy provides insight into the characteristic physical
processes of the high-redshift Universe.

This paper is the third in a series of spatially-resolved
analyses of star-forming regions in BCDs (see Kumari et al.
2017, 2018) where we aim to better understand the physical
and chemical properties of such systems at very small scales.
The performed analysis is in the framework of the following
three questions: (a) Is the ionised gas in a star-forming region
chemically homogeneous? (b) What is the main source of
excitation of the ionised gas in and around a star-forming
region? (c) What is the distribution in age of the population
of stars responsible for ionising the gas?

sionsal gaussian corresponding to a seeing FWHM of 0.6 arcsec
and binned to the GMOS pixel size of 0.1 arcsec.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we
present the observations along with a brief discussion of the
major steps of data-reduction. In Section 3, we present the
results and a discussion of the maps of emission line ﬂuxes,
dust attenuation, gas kinematics, electron temperature and
density, ionic and elemental abundances of various elements
and the abundance ratios and stellar properties. In this sec-
tion, we also perform a radial proﬁle analysis on the elemen-
tal abundance maps and abundance ratio maps to investi-
gate any systematic signatures of chemical inhomogeneities.
Section 4 summarises our results.

2 OBSERVATION & DATA REDUCTION

The target region of SBS1415+437 was observed with
GMOS and the IFU unit (GMOS-N IFU; Allington-Smith
et al. 2002) at Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii. The ob-
servation was taken in one-slit queue-mode in 2012 as a part
of GMOS-IFU spectroscopy programme (PI: B James) for
seven star-forming galaxies. The ﬁeld-of-view covered in this
mode of observation is 3.5(cid:48)(cid:48)× 5(cid:48)(cid:48), and is sampled by 750
hexagonal lenslets of projected diameter of 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48), of which
250 lenslets are used for background determination (see Ta-
ble 2 for information on data observation). The blue and
red regions of the optical spectrum were observed by using
gratings B600+ G5307 and R600+ G5304. A set of standard
observations of GCAL ﬂats, CuAr lamp for wavelength cal-
ibration and standard star for ﬂux calibration were taken
with each grating.

We used the standard GEMINI reduction pipeline writ-
ten in Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF)1 to
perform the basic steps of data reduction which included
bias subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁeld-correction, wavelength calibra-
tion, sky subtraction, diﬀerential atmospheric correction and

data cubes. We found that the standard pipeline did not give
satisfactory results for some procedures, for which we devel-
oped and implemented our own code (see Kumari et al. 2017,
2018). For both data cubes, we chose a spatial-sampling of
0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)which is suitable to preserve the hexagonal sampling of
the GMOS-IFU lenslets. We corrected the data cubes cor-
responding to the two gratings for a spatial-oﬀset of 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48)on
both spatial-axes, and ﬁnally converted them to the row-

stacked spectra for further analysis. We estimated the in-
strumental broadening (Full Width Half Maximum, FWHM
∼ 1.7 ˚A) for both gratings, by ﬁtting a Gaussian proﬁle to
several emission lines of the extracted row stacked spectra of
the arc lamp. We estimated the seeing FWHM of ∼0.6 arcsec
by comparing the R-band continuum image from GMOS-
IFU with the convolved and binned image of this galaxy
obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (Figure
1). The original HST Advanced Camera Surveys (ACS) im-

3 RESULTS & DISCUSSION

3.1 Observed and Intrinsic Fluxes

Figure 2 shows the HST/ACS image of SBS1415+437 taken
in the F606W (V) ﬁlter from Aloisi et al. (2005). The green
rectangular box represents the GMOS aperture (3.5(cid:48)(cid:48) × 5(cid:48)(cid:48)).
The upper-inset shows the Hα image obtained from GMOS
IFU data where we mark Region 1 and Region 2 selected on
the basis of an isophotal Hα emission. The blue parallel lines
indicate the long-slit position of the Kitt Peak 4m Mayall
Telescope observations used in the analysis of Guseva et al.
(2003, hereafter G03). Figure 3 shows the GMOS-IFU inte-
grated spectra of the entire FOV in the blue and red parts

of the optical spectrum. We have overplotted the principal
emission lines at their rest wavelengths in air.

We estimate the emission line ﬂuxes for the recombi-
nation and collisionally excited lines within the spectra by
ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles after subtracting the continuum and
absorption features in the spectral region of interest. We give
equal weight to ﬂux in each spectral pixel while ﬁtting Gaus-
sians. The ﬁtting uncertainties on the three Gaussian pa-
rameters (amplitude, centroid and FWHM) are propagated
to estimate the uncertainty in ﬂuxes. These uncertainty esti-
mates are consistent with those calculated from Monte Carlo
simulations. We have propagated these estimated uncertain-
ties in the ﬂuxes to other quantities using Monte Carlo sim-
ulations in the subsequent analysis.

Figure 4 shows the observed ﬂuxes of R-band contin-
uum, [O iii] λ4363, [O iii] λ5007, Hα, [N ii] λ6583 and [Sii]
λ6731 over the FOV. We obtained the R-band continuum by
integrating the red cube in the wavelength range of 5890–
7270 ˚A (in the rest wavelength). In all maps, white spaxels

The [O iii] λ4363 has S/N > 3 for a region extending over 143
× 143 pc2, though all pixels do not show detection (Figure 4,
upper-right panel). Note here that we could not detect the
[O ii] λλ3727,3729 doublet in our data because of the low
sensitivity of the blue wavelength end of the GMOS-IFU. In

all ﬂux maps, there are two distinct regions with elevated
ﬂuxes, represented by a quarter-ellipse and a circle, which
we refer as Region 1 and Region 2 in subsequent analysis
(also see Figure 2). We detect [O iii] λ4363 in the integrated
spectrum of Region 1, but not in Region 2, so analysis in-
volving this emission line is not performed for Region 2. The

nebular emission line colour excess E(B–V), at an electron
temperature and density of 10000 K and 100 cm−3, respec-
tively (Case B recombination). While mapping E(B-V), we
found that some spaxels away from the bright star-forming
regions have negative values of E(B–V) which is most likely
due to stochastic error and shot noise (Hong et al. 2013).
For such spaxels, we forced E(B–V) to that of the Galac-
tic Foreground (0.0077, Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). Figure
5 shows the E(B-V) map of the FOV, which varies between
0.0077–0.30 mag. The increased value of E(B–V) in Region 1
and Region 2 shows that the star-forming regions are dustier
than the rest of the FOV. The E(B–V) map obtained was
used to deredden the observed ﬂux maps3. From the inte-
grated spectrum of Region 1, we obtain a value of E(B–V)
= 0.057±0.005, which lies in the range of values found in
the literature for this region (0.08 by Thuan et al. (1999)

tively.

observed ﬂuxes of the main emission lines in the integrated
spectrum of Region 1 are presented in Table 3.

To estimate dust attenuation, we used the attenuation
curve of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC Fitzpatrick 1999)2

Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way have similar values in the
wavelength region of interest.

dereddened/intrinsic ﬂuxes for the main emission lines are
shown in Table 3.

3.2 Gas Kinematics

Figure 6 shows the maps of radial velocity (upper panel)
and velocity dispersion (lower panel) of the Hα emission
line, which we obtained from the centroid and the FWHM
of the Gaussian ﬁt to the emission line. The radial veloc-
ity map is corrected for the systemic velocity of 609 kms−1,
and the barycentric velocity of −6.9 kms−1. The velocity
dispersion map is corrected for the instrumental broaden-
ing of 1.7 ˚A which corresponds to ∼ 78 km s−1 at the rest-
wavelength of the Hα emission line.

Figure 6 (upper panel) shows that the radial velocity of
the ionised gas in the region of study varies between ∼ −14 to
19 kms−1. Thuan et al. (1999) reports a solid body rotation
for this BCD across ∼ 30(cid:48)(cid:48). Though our data clearly shows
blueshift and redshift at diﬀerent locations of the FOV, we
do not ﬁnd a deﬁnite axis of rotation. This could be because
our FOV is comparatively small (3.5(cid:48)(cid:48)× 5(cid:48)(cid:48)).

Figure 6 (bottom panel) shows that the velocity disper-
sion of the ionised gas in the region of study varies between
∼20–70 kms−1. Region 1 shows a range of values, whereas
Region 2 has a relatively low velocity dispersion. The ionised
gas to the north-east of Region 1 and north-west of Region
2 shows the highest values of velocity dispersion.

3.3 Emission line ratio diagnostics

In Figure 7, we show the classical emission line ratio diagnos-
tic diagrams ([O iii]λ5007/Hβ versus [S ii]λλ6717,6731/Hα
(left panel) and [O iii]λ5007/Hβ versus [N ii]λ6583/Hα
(right panel)), which are commonly known as BPT diagrams
(Baldwin et al. 1981). In both panels, we show the maximum
starburst line also known as the “Kewley line” as the solid
black curve, which presents a classiﬁcation based on ionisa-
tion/excitation mechanism. On the [N ii] diagnostic diagram
(Figure 7, right panel), the dashed black curve represents
the empirical line derived by Kauﬀmann et al. (2003) using
SDSS spectra of 55 757 galaxies. Our spatially-resolved line
ratios are shown by blue, green and magenta markers which
correspond to the spaxels of Region 1, Region 2 and the rest
of the FOV, respectively. We also show the line ratios ob-
tained from the integrated spectra of Region 1 and Region
2 using larger markers. In the [N ii]-BPT diagram, we ﬁnd
that both spatially-resolved and integrated data lie well be-
low and to the left of the Kewley line, as well as the empirical
line of Kauﬀmann et al. (2003), while on the [S ii]-BPT di-
agram, we ﬁnd that both spatially-resolved and integrated
data lie well below and to the left of the Kewley line. This
shows that the ionised gas in the region under study is pre-
dominantly ionised by the photons from the massive stars.
Figure 8 shows the line ratio maps of the region under
study, which we use to study the ionisation structure of the
ionised gas. As expected, we ﬁnd that the peak of emission
shows the lowest values of [N ii] λ6583/Hα (upper-left panel)
and [S ii] λλ6717,6731/Hα (upper-right panel), and highest
values of [O iii] λ5007/Hβ (lower panel). This indicates that

the more luminous regions (on Hα map) have relatively high
excitation, which is due to the presence of young and massive
stars producing harder ionising radiation. Figure 9 shows a
comparison of ACS/Solar Blind Channel (SBC) FUV (far
ultra violet) image of SBS 1415+437 in the F125LP ﬁlter
(program id: JB7H08010, PI: A Aloisi) and the emission
line ratio map [O iii]/Hβ created from GMOS data. The
contours generated from ACS/SBC image (left panel) are
over-plotted on the [O iii]/Hβ map (right panel). We ﬁnd
that there is an oﬀset between the peak of [O iii]/Hβ and
the peak of FUV image which traces the young stars, and
that the enhancement of [O iii]/Hβ is on the periphery of the
stars traced by FUV. This indicates that the enhancement
of [O iii]/Hβ ratio has resulted due to the ionisation of gas
by hot O and B stars in the surrounding regions. Note here
that the peak of Hα map is oﬀset by ∼ 58 pc with respect to
the peak of the R-band continuum indicative of the region
containing an older stellar population.

3.4 Electron temperature and density

An H ii region is a complex structure. In the following anal-
ysis, the thermal structure of a H ii region is assumed to be
approximated by a three-zone model (Garnett 1992). This

et al. (2003), respectively, showing a classiﬁcation based on excitation/ionisation mechanisms. The line ratios of the two H ii regions
are colour-coded as follows: Region 1: green pentagon, Region 2: blue circle. Smaller dark-coloured markers denote the spatially-resolved
(spaxel-by-spaxel) line-ratios and the bigger light-coloured markers in black contours denote the line-ratios obtained from the integrated
spectrum of the corresponding regions. Magenta coloured markers denote the spatially-resolved line-ratios of the regions of FOV excluding
the two H ii regions. The size of error bars varies for line ratios and the median error bars are shown in left corner of each panel.

model consists of a high-ionisation zone, a low-ionisation
zone and an intermediate-ionisation zone. The innermost
high-ionisation zone corresponds to species such as O2+,
Ne2+, Fe2+, He+ and Ar3+. The outermost low-ionisation
zone corresponds to species such as O+, N+ and S+. The
region between the two is the intermediate-ionisation zone
and corresponds to species such as Ar2+ and S2+. The elec-
tron temperature of each zone can be approximated from
the temperature of the species related to that zone.

To estimate electron temperature Te([O iii]), we use
the dereddened [O iii] line ratio, [O iii] (λ5007 +λ4959)/[O
iii]λ4363 and the calibration from P´erez-Montero (2017,
hereafter P17), which is derived assuming a ﬁve-level atom,
using collision strengths from Aggarwal & Keenan (1999).
Figure 10 (upper panel) shows the derived Te([O iii]) map.
From the integrated spectrum of Region 1, we ﬁnd Te([O
iii]) = 17100 ± 700 K, in agreement with the value found by
G03 (16490 ± 140 K).

To derive the electron density Ne, we use [S ii] doublet
ratio and Te([O iii]) derived above, along with the theo-
retical curves of the [S ii] doublet ratio versus Ne at given
temperatures. Figure 10 (lower panel) shows the Ne map,
where we ﬁnd that majority of the spaxels have Ne < 50
cm−3, indicating that the region under study lies in the low-
density regime. From the integrated spectrum of Region 1,
we ﬁnd Ne < 50 cm−3 which is in agreement with the value
(60 ± 30 cm−3) found by G03.

The temperature of low-ionisation zone Te([O ii]) is
estimated by using Ne and Te calculated above and the
density-dependent calibration given in P17. The Te([O ii])
map (Figure 11, upper-left panel) shows a mean and stan-
dard deviation of ∼15000 K and ∼1600 K, respectively. We
calculated Te([O ii]) ∼15900 ± 500 for the integrated spec-
trum of Region 1, which is higher than the value found by
G03 (14430 ± 110 K). The main diﬀerence is that G03 have
used the expression from Izotov et al. (1994), which is inde-

pendent of density. Using their expression, we ﬁnd the value
to be ∼14700 ± 300 K for the integrated spectrum Region
1, which is in good agreement with their value (G03). The
electron density should be taken into account in determin-
ing Te([O ii]) because of only a weak correlation between
Te([O ii]) and Te([O iii]) (H¨agele et al. 2006, 2008; L´opez-
Hern´andez et al. 2013).

We map Te([N ii]) (Figure 11, upper-right panel) by us-
ing the Te([O iii]) map in the calibration of P´erez-Montero
& Contini (2009), which is based on photoionisation mod-
els. The map shows a variation of 11900–16300 K. For the
integrated of spectrum Region 1, we followed same proce-
dure involving the Te([O iii]) estimated above and calcu-
lated Te([N ii]) = 14200 ± 300 K.

Though both Te([O ii]) and Te([N ii]) correspond to
temperatures of low-ionisation zones, their maps show dif-
ferent structure. This is because the recipe used to obtain
Te([O ii]) involves the use of Ne([S ii]), which results in
similar structures in Te([O ii]) and Ne([S ii]) maps, whereas
Te([N ii]) is directly obtained from Te([O iii]). For the inte-
grated spectrum of Region 1 as well, we ﬁnd that Te([N ii])
is slightly lower than Te([O ii]), even though both ions lie
in the same excitation zone of a nebula. Note here that pho-
toionisation models predicted a higher Te([O ii]) than Te([N
ii]) for the brightest knot BCD Mrk 209 (P´erez-Montero &
D´ıaz 2007). It is possible that the temperature of the two
ions Te([O ii]) and Te([N ii]) might not be the same even if
originating from the same ionisation zone.

We map the temperature of the intermediate-ionization
zone Te([S iii]) by using the empirical ﬁtting between Te([O
iii]) and Te([S iii]) given by H¨agele et al. (2006), which has a
calibration uncertainty of the order of 12%. The Te([S iii])
map (Figure 11, lower panel) shows a mean and standard
deviation of 17000 K and 2000 K, respectively. Following the
same procedure for the integrated spectrum of Region 1, we
estimated Te([S iii]) = 17100±900 K, which is higher than

reported by G03 (15380 ± 110 K), but is in agreement with
their value if we consider the large calibration uncertainty
from H¨agele et al. (2006). G03 have followed the procedure
of Garnett (1992), who assumed that Te([S iii]) = Te([Ar
iii]) and estimated Te([Ar iii]) from Te([O iii]). Using their
recipe, we get a value of Te([S iii]) = 15900 ± 600 which is
in good agreement with G03.

Table 4 summarizes the above results for the integrated
spectrum of Region 1 and the spatially-resolved data. In this
table, we report median and the uncertainty on the median
of the values on the entire map and take into account the
correlation between pixels due to resampling in forming data
cube.

3.5 Chemical Abundances

3.5.1 Ionic and Elemental Abundance

For both spatially-resolved data and the integrated spec-
trum of Region 1, we estimate the ionic abundances (O+/H+,
O2+/H+, N+/H+, S+/H+, S2+/H+, Ne2+/H+ and Ar2+/H+).
We calculate the corresponding ionisation correction factor
(ICF) for each elemental species. Diﬀerent ICF recipes ex-
ist which may or may not depend on metallicity, depending

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

on the assumptions of the photoionisation models used for
deriving ICF expressions (see e.g. Izotov et al. 2006; P´erez-
Montero et al. 2007). Such details of the ICF prescription
for each ionic species are described below. The ICFs are
combined with ionic abundances to estimate the elemental
abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neon and argon.
Table 4 presents the ionic and elemental abundances ob-
tained from the integrated spectrum of Region 1 and also
the spatially-resolved maps for which we give the median
and the uncertainty of all valid data. We ﬁnd that the in-
ferred values of the quantities for the integrated spectrum
and spatially-resolved data are in reasonable agreement with
each other. In the following points, we describe the method-
ology used to derive the chemical abundance maps shown in
Figure 12. Corresponding uncertainty maps are presented in
Figure A1.

• Oxygen abundance: The metallicity of the ionised gas is
expressed as the oxygen abundance as oxygen is the most
prominent heavy element observed in the optical spectrum.
The total oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)) is calculated
from the sum of O+/H+ and O++/H+. Generally, O+/H+ is
estimated from the oxygen doublets of [O ii] λλ3727,3729.
However, we could not detect these doublets in our data

due to the low sensitivity of GMOS-N IFU in the blue end
of the optical spectrum. Instead, we use [O ii] λλ7320,7330
to estimate O+/H+ at the low-ionisation zone temperature
Te([O ii]) by employing the formulation of Kniazev et al.
(2003). We estimated O++/H+ using the [O iii] λλ4959, 5007
at the high ionisation zone temperature Te([O iii]) using
the formulation of P17. Finally we combined O+/H+ and
O++/H+, and obtained the total metallicity. Map is shown
in Figure 12 (upper-left panel).

• Nitrogen abundance: [N ii] λ6548 is not detected with S/N
> 3, but [N ii] λ6583 is detected at suﬃcient S/N. Assuming
an intrinsic emission line ratio between the two nitrogen lines
[N ii] λ6548 = (1/2.9)[N ii] λ6583, we estimated the dered-
dened [N ii] λ6548 from the dereddened ﬂux of [N ii]λ6583.
Using the dereddened ﬂux of [N ii] lines and Te([N ii]) es-
timated in Section 3.4, we employed the formula given in
P17 to map 12 + log(N+/H+). We estimated ICF(N+) from
the abundance maps of total oxygen and singly-ionised oxy-
gen, and ﬁnally mapped 12 + log(N/H) (Figure 12, upper-
right panel).

• Sulphur abundance: We estimated singly-ionised sulphur
abundance (S+/H+) by using the dereddened [S ii] λλ6717,
6731 and Te([O ii]). The auroral line [S iii] λ6312 was used
along with Te([S iii]) to estimate S2+/H+. All of these esti-
mates were derived by using the corresponding expressions
given in P17. We estimated ICF(S+ + S2+) using the clas-
sical formula from Stasi´nska (1978), but using α = 3.27
derived by Dors et al. (2016). We ﬁnally combined ionic
abundance with the ICF correction to derive the elemental
sulphur abundance, 12 + log(S/H). Corresponding map is
shown in Figure 12 (middle-left panel).

• Neon abundance: We estimated doubly-ionised neon abun-
dance (Ne2+/H+) by using the dereddened [Ne iii] λ3869 and
Te([O iii]), and derived ICF(Ne2+) using the expressions
from P´erez-Montero et al. (2007), which is independent of
metallicity. Combining the ionic-abundance with the ICF,

pixels.

we derived the elemental neon abundance, 12 + log(Ne/H).
Map is shown in Figure 12 (lower panel).

• Argon abundance: We estimated doubly-ionised argon
abundance (Ar2+/H+) by using the dereddened [Ar iii] λ7135
and Te([S iii]) the temperature of intermediate-ionisation
zone, in the expression given in P17. We estimated the
metallicity-independent ICF(Ar2+) using expression given
in P´erez-Montero et al. (2007) to derive the elemental ar-
gon abundance, 12 + log(Ar/H). Map is shown in Figure 12
(middle-right panel).

The abundance maps of 12 + log(O/H) and 12 +
log(N/H) shows relatively high and low values, respectively
in the north-east of the peak Hα ﬂux exactly at the same lo-
cation where we ﬁnd high electron density (Figure 10, lower
panel). To check this, we estimated electron densities from
the integrated spectra of two diﬀerent regions within this
over-density region. Though their electron densities are high,

the associated uncertainties are also large, which indicates
that the region may well have the same electron density as
the majority of the pixels, i.e. Ne < 50 cm−3. So we suspect
that the abundance patterns on the maps of 12 + log(O/H)
and 12 + log(N/H) may not be real variations.

Our derived values of 12 + log(O/H), 12 +
log(O2+/H+), 12 + log(N+/H+) and Ne2+/H+ are in excel-
lent agreement with those obtained by G03. However, the
values of 12 + log(O+/H+), S+/H+, S2+/H+ and Ar2+/H+
do not agree with those from G03, since these abundance
estimates depend on the low-ionisation zone temperature
(Te ([O ii])) and the intermediate zone temperature (Te ([S
iii])), and these temperature estimates in our work are dif-
ferent from those obtained by G03 for the reasons described
in section 3.4.

In the above analysis, our derived ICFs do not match
those of G03. As such, we estimated the ICFs for data from
G03 using our adopted recipes for ICF calculation, which
now exactly match our derived ICFs. The total elemental
abundances of nitrogen, sulphur, neon and argon do not
match those derived from G03 because of the following two
diﬀerences: ﬁrstly the ionic abundances in the two works are
diﬀerent as a result of the diﬀerent electron temperatures,

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

secondly diﬀerent ICF prescriptions have been used in the
two works. This results in obvious diﬀerences in the abun-
dance ratios between our work and G03. In addition to the
ICF and ionic abundances, diﬀerence in ionic and elemen-
tal abundances might also be due to spatial eﬀects since the
GMOS-IFU FOV does not coincide exactly with the long-slit
of G03.

3.5.2 Abundance Ratios

Figure 13 shows the maps of abundance ratios, while cor-
responding uncertainty maps are presented in Figure A2.
We ﬁnd an abundance pattern in the north-east region in
the maps of S/O, Ar/O and N/O similar to that of the
electron density map. Hence, these may not be real as dis-
cussed in Section 3.5.1. The abundance ratios for the in-
tegrated spectrum and spatially-resolved maps of Region
1 agree with each other within error bars as tabulated in
Table 4. Our abundance ratio estimates are systematically
lower than those of a sample of 40 BCDs analysed by Izo-
tov & Thuan (1999). However, such low values have been
reported in the IFU studies of BCDs. One such BCD is the
interaction-induced starburst UM 462 (James et al. 2010)

dex, 0.3 dex, 0.3 dex and 0.3 dex, respectively, as estimated from the corresponding uncertainty maps given in Figure A1.

3.5.3 Variation of abundances

The high-resolution HST image shows distinct structure
throughout the region of our study (Figure 2). However,
the observed Hα emission line ﬂux map of Region 1 shows
approximately an elliptical distribution (Figure 4). No ellip-
tical distribution is obvious in any abundance maps (Figure
12) or abundance ratio maps (Figure 13), though we note
that an over-density is observed in Ne abundance map (Fig-
ure 12, bottom panel) in the region north-east of the peak
of Hα emission. In this Section, we explore the small scale
abundance variation to investigate how well-mixed the gas
is within the region of study.

We perform this analysis via three diﬀerent methods,
though we show results from only two methods. The ﬁrst two
methods are based on the segmentation of Region 1 in six el-
liptical annuli of equal widths selected on the basis of the Hα
ﬂux distribution such that each of the annuli have roughly
similar levels of ﬂux within a given annulus. The position of
the chosen elliptical annuli are shown in Figure 14, and are
marked as A, B, C, D, E and F. In the ﬁrst method, we esti-
mated abundances and abundance ratios from the emission
line ﬂuxes from the integrated spectra within each annulus,

Figure 14. Hα ﬂux map is used to separate the H ii region into
six equally-spaced segments (A, B, C, D, E, F) such that each of
them have similar overall ﬂux within each annulus. These annuli
are used for the chemical inhomogeneity investigation described
in Section 3.5.3. Please see location of Region 1 in Figure 2.

data and the associated uncertainty within annuli A, B, C, D, E, F (shown in Figure 14) of a given chemical abundance map. The error
bar corresponding to annulus F is large because of the paucity of data points in this annulus. Blue points are the observables derived
from the integrated spectra of each annulus. We also present the corresponding values of entire Region 1 (marked as “Reg1”). The black

which are reported in Table B2. In the second method, we
estimate abundances and abundance ratios within each an-
nulus from the spaxel maps instead of integrated spectra.
We study the variation of estimates from the two methods
from one annulus to another as described later. In the third
method, we simply study the variation of abundances in a
pixel with respect to its physical distance from the pixel of

peak Hα ﬂux (i.e. radial distance in elliptical coordinates).
This last method was performed to check if our method of
segmentation could aﬀect any observed trend.

Figures 15 and 16 show the variation of elemental abun-
dances and abundance ratios from one elliptical annulus to
another. The observables from the integrated spectra of each
annulus are shown as blue dots. For all maps of abundances

and abundance ratios, we estimate median and uncertainty
on the median within each annulus, and are shown as red
dots and vertical bars, respectively. The uncertainties on the
median values for each sample point take into account the
spatial correlation between adjacent spaxels arising from the
resampling used in generating the data cubes. The overall
average level of the correlation was estimated using an auto-
correlation analysis of selected regions from the spaxel map
after ﬁrst removing larger scale gradients. In practice this
provides an estimate of the factor (in this case ≈ 4) by which
the number of apparently independent spaxels in each el-
liptical annulus region should be reduced to allow for the
induced spatial correlation. The abundance and abundance
ratios of region 1 are also shown on the panels in Figures
15 and 16, as estimated from the integrated spectrum (blue
dots) and the maps (red dots) for a better visual compari-
son, and should not be considered for abundance variation
analysis. In each panel, the dashed black horizontal line indi-
cates the median (µ) of the abundances or abundance ratio
distribution of entire maps, while the two dotted black hor-
izontal lines indicate µ ± σ, where σ denoted the standard
deviation of entire maps.

Inspecting all panels in Figure 15 and 16, we ﬁnd that
the integrated spectra values and mapped values in each an-
nulus are in reasonable agreement with each other. Results of
annulus F should be interpreted with caution where uncer-
tainties on each observable are comparatively large because
of a few valid data points (∼ 2–3 depending on the map) in
this annulus (see maps in Figures 12 and 13). Though re-
sults of annulus F are not particularly informative, we have
included them in our analysis as we do not wish to discard
any detection.

No variation is found in 12 + log(O/H). There appears
to be a variation in abundances of elements (other than O)
and abundance ratios around annuli C and D, though these
variations are < 0.1 dex for each observable. Given that there
exists a region of over-density in the Ne abundance map
(Figure 12), it is possible that the physical conditions are
diﬀerent within the region of study and is supported by the
HST image which shows structures throughout this region.
Figure 17 shows a comparison of Hα images obtained with
the GMOS-IFU and HST (F658N). The corresponding con-
tinuum image (taken in the F606W ﬁlter of HST) was scaled
and subtracted from the narrow-band F658N image, to ob-
tain the continuum-subtracted Hα image (Figure 17, left
panel). The overlaid black contours are generated from this
original HST image, showing resolvable structure. To com-
pare the HST image directly with the GMOS Hα image, we
convolved it to FWHM seeing of 0.6 arcsec and rebinned to
0.1 arcsec per pixel. The resultant smoothed image (Figure
17, middle panel) has the black contours generated from the
original HST image overlaid for comparison. The processed
HST image is remarkably similar to the GMOS Hα image
(Figure 17, right panel), whose contours (white curves) also
show a smooth variation of ﬂux.

Since the region under study appears to host multiple
H ii regions, we infer that the absence of radial variation is
probably because of the eﬀects of seeing and that a consider-
able number of pixels with lower abundances in annuli A, B
and C have suppressed signatures of over-abundance should
they exist. This experiment shows that such segmentation

quarter ellipse and circle indicate Region 1 and Region 2, respec-
tively.

analysis may not be a good tool to ﬁnd localised abundance
variation, which results in averaging out such local eﬀects.
We also performed a Lillefors test of normality for test-
ing homogeneity on the maps of abundances and abundance
ratios, which was inconclusive. Peforming the Lillefors test
on the abundance and abundance ratio maps normalised by
their error maps was also inconclusive. For example, the p-
value of Lillefors test was greater than 0.05 for Ne abundance
map indicating chemical homogeneity in spite of the map ap-
parently showing some chemical inhomogeneity. Hence, we
conclude that tests of chemical inhomogeneity must account
for both the spatial information as well as the spaxel error.
The current analysis also shows the power of IFS with good
spatial-sampling, without which over-abundance in the Ne
abundance map would only have appeared as noise. Further-
more, we need to consider the eﬀects of seeing which tends
to wash out small spatial scale variation in the abundance
maps.

3.6 Stellar Properties

3.6.1 Age of stellar population

The integrated spectrum of the FOV (Figure 3) show Balmer
emission lines indicating the presence of young, hot and mas-
sive O and B stars embedded in gas, while we do not ﬁnd any
Balmer absorption lines showing that the region is mostly
composed of younger stellar population. No Wolf-Rayet fea-
tures are found in the integrated or spatially-resolved spec-
tra of SBS 1415+437, in agreement with the results of L´opez-
S´anchez & Esteban (2010).

For age-dating the current ionising population, we ﬁrst
map the equivalent width (EW) of the Hα recombination
line (Figure 18).This map shows a mean of ∼696 ˚A and
standard deviation of ∼440 ˚A. From the integrated spec-
trum of Region 1, we ﬁnd an equivalent width of ∼940 ± 10
˚A, which is in reasonable agreement with the value found by
G03 (997.9 ± 1.7 ˚A).

Next, we calculate the EW(Hα) from the evolution-
ary synthesis models of starburst99. Note here that the

for running these models are described in detail in Kumari
et al. (2017), which include the assumptions of instantaneous
starburst, Salpeter intial mass function, Geneva tracks with
stellar rotation and expanding atmosphere models. The only
diﬀerence here is on the assumption of metallicity, which
is the mean of the metallicity map (Figure 12, upper-left
panel), i.e. Z = 0.1Z(cid:12). Note here that instead of assum-
ing a constant metallicity for the entire FOV, we could use
the metallicity map where metallicity varies from spaxel to
spaxel. Howeover, the minimum metallicity of the spectra
output by Starburst99 is 0.05Z(cid:12), whereas our metallicity
map shows values < 0.05Z(cid:12). Moreover, the metallicity grid
used by Starburst99 is far too coarse to correctly reﬂect
the pixel-to-pixel variation seen in our maps. Hence, with
the current set of models, it is not possible to create an age
map varying as a function of metallicity. By comparing the
modelled EW from the evolutionary synthesis models with
the observed EW(Hα), we obtain the age map (Figure 19)
which shows a mean and standard deviation of 15 Myr and
6 Myr, respectively. We ﬁnd the age of ∼ 10 Myr for Region
1 obtained from its integrated spectrum. Our results are in
reasonable agreement with that of Thuan et al. (1999), who
reports the presence of young stellar population (∼ 5 Myr)
along with stars as old as 100 Myr in Region 1. G03 es-
timated an age of 4 Myr for Region 1 from the galactic
evolution code PEGASE, which is lower than our value of ∼
10 Myr for two reasons. Firstly the metallicity assumed by
G03 is 0.05 Z(cid:12) compared to our metallicity assumption of
0.1 Z(cid:12). Secondly, our modelling does not take into account
nebular continuum or dust-extinction which will lead to sys-
tematic uncertainties in the estimated age (Cantin et al.
2010; P´erez-Montero & D´ıaz 2007). Note also that Star-
burst99 does not take into account the binary population,
even though ∼ 50% of stars are found in binaries. Ignoring
the binary population is another source of systematic un-
certainty in the determined age. These age estimates should
be further interpreted with caution as suggested by Aloisi
et al. (2005), who report the presence of stars older than
∼ 1.3 Gyr (e.g. red giant branch stars) via a photometric
analysis involving colour-magnitude diagrams.

3.6.2 Star Formation Rate

We estimated the star-formation rate (SFR) from the dered-
dened Hα luminosity assuming solar and sub-solar metal-
licity by using the recipes of Ly et al. (2016) and Kenni-
cutt (1998), respectively assuming a Chabrier IMF. We nor-
malise the SFR map by the area of each pixel to obtain the
SFR density (SFRD) map. The SFRD map created assum-
ing sub-solar metallicity (Figure 20) shows a variation of
0.03–1.89 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2. The SFRD map created assum-
ing solar metallicity shows a variation of 0.06–3.79 M(cid:12) yr−1
kpc−2 and has the same appearance as the map at sub-solar
metallicity. SFR values on pixel-by-pixel basis should be in-
terpreted with caution because of the failure of SFR recipes
due to the stochastic sampling of the IMF at such small spa-
tial scales. For Region 1, we ﬁnd a SFR of ∼ 22.0 ± 0.3 ×
10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 assuming metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.63
, and ∼ 44.9 ± 0.5 × 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 assuming solar metal-
licity. For Region 1, we estimate a SFRD ∼ 0.7 M(cid:12) yr−1
kpc−2 from our data assuming a metallicity of 12+log(O/H)
= 7.63. For comparison, if we were to use the MMT spec-

The dashed quarter ellipse and circle indicate Region 1 and Re-
gion 2, respectively.

starburst99 models are used here considering that an in-
dividual spaxel might constitute an independent H ii region
on the basis of the following argument. Hα ﬂux map (Fig-
ure 4, middle-right panel) shows a variation of 4.0×10−17 to
1.2×10−15 erg s−1 cm−2, which corresponds to luminosities
varying between 8.9×1035 and 2.7×1037 erg s−1 and ionising
photons varying between 6.5×1047 and 2.0×1049 photons s−1.
The ionising photons on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis lie within
the range of ionising photons emitted by individual O and
B stars, i.e. 1046 – 5×1049 photons s−1 for dwarfs and 4×
1047 – 8×1049 photons s−1 for supergiants (Sternberg et al.
2003). This shows that each spaxel might host O and B stars
leading to H ii regions, though we can not discard the ef-
fects of a stochastic sampling of the initial mass function at
such small spatial scales. The parameters and assumptions

troscopic observation of Thuan et al. (1999) extracted over
a region of 1.5 arcsec × 5 arcsec, we estimate a SFRD ∼
0.5 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 assuming 12 + log(O/H) = 7.60 (Thuan
et al. 1999). Our value of SFRD agrees with that of Thuan
et al. (1999) within a factor of 2. From the Hα ﬂux value of
G03 , we estimate a SFRD ∼ 0.17 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 assuming
12 + log(O/H) = 7.61 (G03) over a region of 2 arcsec × 4.6
arcsec. The low value of SFRD obtained from the data of
G03 is due to their estimate of c(Hβ) = 0.00, which results
in a lower value of dereddened Hα ﬂux. It is also possible
that the GMOS-FOV covers brighter star-forming regions
than the long-slit data of G03.

4 SUMMARY & CONCLUSION

Using GMOS-N IFS data, we carried out a spatially-resolved
analysis of the ionised gas in a star-forming region within the
BCD SBS 1415+437 at scales of ∼6.5 pc. What follows is a
summary of our main results.

(i) The radial velocity of the ionised gas varies between −12 to
18 km s−1, with no particular axis of rotation in the central
region. The velocity dispersion varies between 20–70 km s−1.
The gas is predominantly photoionised as inferred from the
emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams.

(ii) The IFS data allows us to map the weak auroral line [O
iii] λ4363 across a region of 143 × 143 pc2 thereby enabling
us to map the electron temperature Te([O iii]) and density
Ne([S ii]) in this region. This allows us to use the direct
Te-method to map the ionic and elemental abundances of
various elements.

(iii) We map the ionic and elemental abundances of O, N, Ne,
Ar and S, and also the abundance ratios, N/O, Ne/O, S/O
and Ar/O. We also estimate these observables from the in-
tegrated spectrum of the main emission region (Region 1),
which are in reasonable agreement with the median of cor-
responding values in the maps. The oxygen abundance from
our IFS data is in agreement with that obtained from the
long-slit spectroscopy, i.e. 12 + log(O/H) = 7.63 ± 0.03.
(iv) The age map of the region under study shows a mean and
standard deviation of 15 Myr and 6Myr, respectively, as in-
ferred from a comparison of the EW(Hα) map to the val-
ues determined from the starburst99 models at a uniform
metallicity of 0.1 Z(cid:12). The SFRD is found to vary between
0.03–1.89 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 across the region of study. The
SFR of Region 1 is estimated to be ∼ 22.0 ± 0.3 × 10−3
M(cid:12)yr−1 assuming a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.63.
(v) We performed a radial proﬁle analysis on the maps of chem-
ical abundances and their ratios, where we chose elliptical
annuli of equal widths following the Hα ﬂux distribution in
the FOV. No signiﬁcant radial variation was found in either
elemental abundance maps or the abundance ratio maps,
despite the map of Ne/H exhibiting signatures of chemical
inhomogeneity

In conclusion, this study not only answers questions re-
lated to kinematics, ionisation conditions, chemical varia-
tions and stellar properties of SBS 1415+437 stated in the
beginning of the paper, but also poses further questions on
the most eﬀective way to study chemical variations at small
scales from IFS studies. We found that the radial proﬁle

analysis does not show signiﬁcant chemical variation de-
spite local enhancements in the neon abundance map. In
the current study, seeing prevented us from studying such
variations at spatial scales exploitable at the high spatial-
sampling of GMOS-IFU. There will not be such problem
with the implementation of adaptive optics in the current
IFS instruments, e.g. MUSE on the Very Large Telescope,
and space-based IFUs, e.g. the Near-Infrared Spectrograph
on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Wide
Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Above analysis shows that
a test of chemical inhomogeneity must take into account
various factors such as spaxel uncertainty, spatial informa-
tion and the eﬀects of seeing, which we will explore on a
larger sample of galaxies in an upcoming work. From this
study, we learnt that the abundances estimated from the in-
tegrated spectrum of a star-forming region is in reasonable
agreement with the average value derived from the abun-
dance maps across the star-forming region. This consistency
adds conﬁdence to our chemical abundance measurements
of star-forming systems in the high-redshift Universe, where
no spatial resolution is available, allowing us to accurately
study the chemical evolution across diﬀerent star-forming
epochs. With the long-awaited JWST, we will be able to
detect the distant and hence faint star-forming systems and
study the chemical evolution of Universe with relatively less
biases.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Figures and Tables presented in appendices are available as
supplementary material at M N RAS online.

APPENDIX A: UNCERTAINTY MAPS

Figures A1 & A2 present the uncertainty maps for abun-
dance maps (Figure 15) and abundance ratio maps (Figure
16), respectively. These maps have been obtained via Monte-
Carlo simulations.

APPENDIX B: FLUX AND ABUNDANCE
TABLES CORRESPONDING TO EACH
ANNULUS

Table B1 presents the observed and intrinsic ﬂux values from
integrated spectra of each annulus described in Section 3.5.3.
The abundances and abundance ratios within each annulus
are presented in Table B2.
