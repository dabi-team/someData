(Dated: October 7, 2020)

We report on the ﬁrst measurement of ﬂux-integrated single diﬀerential cross sections for charged-
current (CC) muon neutrino (νµ) scattering on argon with a muon and a proton in the ﬁnal state,
40Ar (νµ, µp)X. The measurement was carried out using the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermi Na-
tional Accelerator Laboratory and the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber detector
with an exposure of 4.59 × 1019 protons on target. Events are selected to enhance the contribution
of CC quasielastic (CCQE) interactions. The data are reported in terms of a total cross section as
well as single diﬀerential cross sections in ﬁnal state muon and proton kinematics. We measure the
integrated per-nucleus CCQE–like cross section (i.e. for interactions leading to a muon, one proton
and no pions above detection threshold) of (4.93 ± 0.76stat ± 1.29sys) × 10−38cm2, in good agreement
with theoretical calculations. The single diﬀerential cross sections are also in overall good agreement
with theoretical predictions, except at very forward muon scattering angles that correspond to low
momentum-transfer events.

Measurements of neutrino oscillation serve as a valu-
able tool for extracting neutrino mixing angles, mass-
squared diﬀerences, and the CP violating phase, as well
as for searching for new physics beyond the standard
model in the electroweak sector [1, 2].

Neutrinos oscillate as a function of their propagation
distance divided by their energy. In accelerator-based os-
cillation experiments, the neutrino propagation distance
is well deﬁned. However, as these experiments do not
use mono-energetic neutrino beams [3–5], the accuracy
to which they can extract neutrino oscillation parame-
ters depends on their ability to determine the individual
energy of the detected neutrinos. This requires detailed
understanding of the fundamental interactions of neutri-
nos with atomic nuclei that comprise neutrino detectors.
Understanding the interaction of neutrinos with argon
nuclei is of particular importance as a growing number
of neutrino oscillation experiments employ liquid argon
time projector chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detectors.
These include the Deep Underground Neutrino Experi-
ment (DUNE) [6–9], which aims to measure the neutrino
CP-violating phase and mass hierarchy, and the Short
Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program [10], that is search-
ing for physics beyond the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagaw–
Sakata (PMNS) matrix model of neutrino mixing.

Experimentally, the energy of interacting neutrinos is
determined from the measured momenta of particles that
are emitted following the neutrino interaction in the de-
tector. Many accelerator-based oscillation studies fo-
cus on measurements of charged-current (CC) neutrino-
nucleon quasielastic (QE) scattering interactions [11–20],
where the neutrino removes a single intact nucleon from

the nucleus without producing any additional particles.
This choice is guided by the fact that CCQE reactions
can be reasonably well approximated as two-body inter-
actions, and their experimental signature of a correlated
muon-proton pair is relatively straightforward to mea-
sure. Therefore, precise measurements of CCQE pro-
cesses are expected to allow precise reconstruction of neu-
trino energies with discovery-level accuracy [21].

A working deﬁnition for identifying CCQE interactions
in experimental measurements requires the identiﬁcation
of a neutrino interaction vertex with an outgoing lepton,
exactly one outgoing proton, and no additional particles;
We refer to these herein as “CCQE–like” events. This
deﬁnition can include contributions from non–CCQE in-
teractions that lead to the production of additional par-
ticles that are absent from the ﬁnal state due to nuclear
eﬀects such as pion absorption or have momenta that are
below the experimental detection threshold.

Existing data on neutrino CCQE–like interactions
come from experiments using various energies and tar-
get nuclei [22]. These primarily include measurements
of CCQE–like muon neutrino (νµ) cross sections for in-
teractions where a muon and no pions were detected,
with [17–20] and without [11–16] requiring the additional
detection of a proton in the ﬁnal state. While most rele-
vant for LArTPC based oscillation experiments, no mea-
surements of CCQE–like cross sections on 40Ar with the
detection of a proton in the ﬁnal state exist.

This letter presents the ﬁrst measurement of exclusive
CCQE–like neutrino-argon interaction cross-sections,
measured using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time pro-
jection chamber (LArTPC). Our data serve as the ﬁrst

study of exclusive CCQE–like diﬀerential cross sections
on 40Ar as well as a benchmark for theoretical mod-
els of νµ-40Ar interactions, which are key for performing
a precise extraction of oscillation parameters by future
LArTPC oscillation experiments.

We focus on a speciﬁc subset of CCQE–like inter-
actions, denoted here as CC1p0π, where the contribu-
tion of CCQE interactions is enhanced [23]. These in-
clude charged-current νµ-40Ar scattering events with a
detected muon and exactly one proton, with momenta
greater than 100 MeV/c and 300 MeV/c, respectively.
The measured muon-proton pairs are required to be co-
planar with small missing transverse momentum and
minimal residual activity near the interaction vertex that
is not associated with the measured muon or proton. For
these CC1p0π events we measure the ﬂux–integrated νµ-
40Ar total and diﬀerential cross sections in muon and
proton momentum and angle, and as a function of the
calorimetric measured energy and the reconstructed mo-
mentum transfer.

The measurement uses data from the MicroBooNE
LArTPC detector [24], which is the ﬁrst of a series of
LArTPCs to be used for precision oscillation measure-
ments [6–10, 25]. The MicroBooNE detector has an ac-
tive mass of 85 tons and is located along the Booster
Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab, 463 m downstream
from the target. The BNB energy spectrum extends to
2 GeV and peaks around 0.7 GeV [3].

A neutrino is detected by its interaction with an argon
nucleus in the LArTPC. The secondary charged particles
produced in the interaction travel through the liquid ar-
gon, leaving a trail of ionization electrons that drift hori-
zontally and transverse to the neutrino beam direction in
an electric ﬁeld of 273 V/cm, to a system of three anode
wire planes located 2.5 m from the cathode plane. The
Pandora tracking package [26] is used to form individual
particle tracks from the measured ionization signals. Par-
ticle momenta are determined from the measured track
length for protons and multiple Coulomb scattering pat-
tern for muons [27].

The analysis presented here is performed on data col-
lected from the BNB beam, with an exposure of 4.59 ×
1019 protons on target (POT). At nominal running con-
ditions, one neutrino interaction is expected in approxi-
mately 500 BNB beam spills. A trigger based on scintil-
lation light detected by 32 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
increases the fraction of recorded spills with a neutrino
interaction to ≈ 10%. Application of additional soft-
ware selection further rejects background events, mostly
from cosmic muons, to provide a sample that contains a
neutrino interaction in ≈ 15% of selected spills [28, 29].
CCQE-like event selection, further cosmic rejection and
neutrino-induced background rejection are described in
Ref. [23]. Muon-proton pair candidates are identiﬁed by
requiring two tracks with a common vertex and an en-
ergy deposition proﬁle consistent with a proton and a

3

muon [30]. Further cuts on the track pair opening angle
(|∆θµ,p − 90◦| < 55◦) and the muon and proton track
lengths (lµ > lp) reduce the cosmic background rate to
less than 1% [23].

The selected CC1p0π event deﬁnition includes events
with any number of protons with momenta below 300
MeV/c, neutrons at any momenta, and charged pions
with momentum lower than 70 MeV/c. The minimal
proton momentum requirement of 300 MeV/c is guided
by its stopping range in LAr and corresponds to ﬁve wire
pitches in the TPC, to ensure an eﬃcient particle identi-
ﬁcation.

To avoid contributions

from cosmic tracks, our
CC1p0π selection considers only pairs of tracks with a
fully-contained proton candidate and a fully or partially
contained muon candidate in the ﬁducial volume of the
MicroBooNE detector. The ﬁducial volume is deﬁned by
3 < x < 253 cm, -110 < y < 110 cm, and 5 < z < 1031
cm. The x axis points along the negative drift direction
with 0 cm placed at the anode plane, y points vertically
upward with 0 cm at the center of the detector, and z
points along the direction of the beam, with 0 cm at the
upstream edge of the detector. Tracks are fully contained
if both the start point and end point are within this vol-
ume and partially contained if only the start point is
within this volume.

We limit our analysis to a phase space region where the
detector response to our signal is well understood and its
eﬀective detection eﬃciency is higher than 2.5%. This
corresponds to 0.1 < pµ < 1.5 GeV/c, 0.3 < pp < 1.0
GeV/c, −0.65 < cos θµ < 0.95, and cos θp > 0.15. Ad-
ditional kinematical selections are used to enhance the
contribution of CCQE interactions in our CC1p0π sam-
ple. These include requiring that the measured muon-
proton pairs be coplanar (|∆φµ,p − 180◦| < 35◦) relative
to the beam axis, have small missing transverse momen-
tum relative to the beam direction (pT = |(cid:126)p µ
T | < 350
MeV/c), and have a small energy deposition around the
interaction vertex that is not associated with the muon
or proton tracks.

T +(cid:126)p p

After the application of the event selection require-
ment, we retain 410 CC1p0π candidate events. We es-
timate that our CC1p0π CCQE–like event selection pu-
rity equals ≈ 84% [23], with 81% of the measured events
originating from an underlying CCQE interaction as de-
ﬁned by the GENIE event generator. The eﬃciency for
detecting CC1p0π CCQE–like events, out of all gener-
ated CC1p0π with an interaction vertex within our ﬁdu-
cial volume, was estimated using our Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation and equals ≈ 20% [23]. We note that this eﬃ-
ciency includes acceptance eﬀects, as the typical LArTPC
eﬃciency for reconstructing a contained high-momentum
proton or muon track is grater than ∼ 90% [26].

We report single diﬀerential cross sections in measured
proton and muon kinematics. The diﬀerential cross sec-

tion is given by:

where, X = pµ, cos θµ, φµ, pp, cos θp, φp stands for the
kinematical variable that the cross section is diﬀerential
in and n marks the cross-section bin. In each bin n, N on

n are
the diﬀerential bin widths, and (cid:15)n is the eﬀective particle
detection eﬃciency.

n and ∆p

As the detection eﬃciency is a multidimensional func-
tion of the interaction vertex and the particle momentum
and direction, the data were binned in three-dimensional
momentum, in-plane, and out-of-place angle bins with
the eﬀective detection eﬃciency calculated for each such
bin separately and integrated over the interaction vertex
in the detector. The eﬃciency was extracted based on
simulation and is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of
reconstructed CC1p0π events to the number of true gen-
erated CC1p0π events (with a vertex inside our ﬁducial
volume) in bin n. This procedure accounts for bin mi-
gration eﬀects such that cross-sections are obtained as
a function of real (as oppose to experimentally recon-
structed) kinematical variables. The results presented
herein include the bin migration corrections, which gen-
erally have a small impact on the nominal cross-section
values as compared with the total cross-section uncer-
tainties (see supplementary materials). The proton and
muon eﬃciencies were extracted independently of each
other (rather than from a full six–fold binning), such that
when the cross-section is diﬀerential in muon kinematics
the proton kinematics is integrated over and vise-versa.
This is done due to the limited data and simulation statis-
tics and is justiﬁed since the proton and muon eﬃciencies
are largely independent in the region of interest. The ef-
fect of residual correlations is accounted for in the sys-
tematic uncertainties. We further note that the missing
transverse momentum requirement increases the sensi-
tivity of our eﬃciency corrections to the meson exchange
current (MEC) and ﬁnal state interaction (FSI) models
used in our simulations. We accounted for the model
sensitivity in our systematic studies detailed below.

The extracted cross sections are expected to be inde-
pendent of the azimuthal angle φ. However, the simple
model used to simulate the eﬀect of induced charge on
neighboring TPC wires leads to a low reconstruction ef-
ﬁciency of tracks perpendicular to the wire planes (φ ≈ 0
and φ ≈ ±π) that created an artiﬁcial φ dependence
to the cross section. We correct for this eﬀect using
an iterative procedure. We ﬁrst reweight events with
a muon track falling in the φ ≈ 0 bin and | sin θ| > 0.3

to the weighted average of the cross sections in all other
bins of φµ where | sin θ| > 0.3. Due to the coplanarity
requirement, this reweighting aﬀects the distribution of
φp ≈ ±π. We repeat the process starting from a proton
track with φp ≈ 0 until the cross section change is less
than 0.01%, typically after 5 iterations.

The integrated measured CC1p0π cross section is sum-
marized in Table I. The statistical uncertainty of our
measurement is 15.9%. The systematic uncertainty sums
to 26.2% and includes contributions from the neutrino
ﬂux prediction and POT estimation (18.7%), detector re-
sponse modeling (18.4%), imperfect proton and muon ef-
ﬁciency decoupling (5.7%), and neutrino interaction cross
section modeling (7.1%).

same beam line [13]. We account for the small distance
between MiniBooNE and MicroBooNE. Neutrino cross
section modeling uncertainties were estimated using the
GENIE framework of event reweighting [31, 32] with its
standard reweighting parameters. For both cross section
and ﬂux systematics, we use a multisim technique [33],
which consists of generating many MC replicas, each one
called a “universe”, where model parameters are varied
within their uncertainties. Each universe represents a dif-
ferent reweighting. The simultaneous reweighting of all
model parameters allows the correct treatment of their
correlations.

A diﬀerent model is followed for detector model sys-
tematic uncertainties, that are dominated by individual
detector parameters. Unisim samples [33] are generated,
where one detector parameter is varied each time by 1σ.
We then examine the impact of each parameter variation
on the extracted cross sections, by obtaining the diﬀer-
ences with respect to the central value on a bin–by–bin
basis. We note that the detection eﬃciency used for the
cross section extraction is re-evaluated for each variation
separately, including bin migration corrections. This pro-
cedure therefore accounts for the systematic uncertainty
in these corrections due to both the cross-section and de-
tector response modeling. One exception to this process
is the systematic uncertainty due to induced charge ef-
fects mentioned above that include the data-driven cor-
rection and are thus estimated separately (see supple-
mentary materials). We then deﬁne the total detector
1σ systematic uncertainty by summing in quadrature the
eﬀect of each individual variation.

A dedicated MC simulation was used to estimate possi-
ble background from events in which a neutrino interacts
outside the MicroBooNE cryostat but produce particles
that enter the TPC and pass the event selection cuts [16].
No such events were found in that study, which is also

supported by our observation that the z-vertex distribu-
tions for the measured events follows a uniform distribu-
tion (see supplementary materials).

The MC simulation used to estimate the backgrounds
and eﬀective eﬃciency contains real cosmic data over-
layed onto a neutrino interaction simulation that uses
GENIE [31, 32] to simulate both the signal events and
the beam backgrounds. See Ref. [23] for details. For
the simulated portion, the particle propagation is based
on GEANT4 [34], while the simulation of the Micro-
BooNE detector is performed in the LArSoft frame-
work [35, 36]. The beam–related background subtracted
from the CC1p0π events is simulated.

Fig. 1 shows the ﬂux integrated single diﬀerential
CC1p0π cross section as a function of the cosine of the
measured muon scattering angle. The data are compared
to several theoretical calculations and to our GENIE-
based MC prediction. The latter is the result of analyz-
ing a sample of MC events produced using our “nominal”
GENIE model and propagated through the full detector
simulation in the same way as data.

This model (GENIE v2.12.2) [31, 32] treats the nucleus
as a the Bodek-Ritchie Fermi Gas, used the Llewellyn-
Smith CCQE scattering prescription [37], and the empir-
ical MEC model [38], Rein-Sehgal resonance (RES) and
coherent scattering (COH) model [39], a data driven FSI
model denoted as “hA” [40].

In addition, theoretical predictions by several other
event generators are shown at the cross-section level (i.e
with no detector simulations) [41]. These include GE-
NIE v2.12.2 and v3.0.6 [31, 32], NuWro 19.02.1 [42], and
NEUT v5.4.0 [43] (see supplementary materials). The
agreement between the “nominal” GENIE calculation
(v2.12.2) and the MC prediction constitutes a closure

model [44] and Random Phase Approximation correc-
tion [45]. GENIE v3.0.6 also includes Coulomb correc-
tions for the outgoing muon [46]. The theoretical mod-
els implemented in these event generators include free
parameters that are typically ﬁt to data, with diﬀerent
generators using diﬀerent data sets. We also consider
the GiBUU 2019 [47] event generator which fundamen-
tally diﬀers from the others due to its use of a transport
equation approach.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, all models are in overall good
agreement with our data, except for the highest cos θµ
bin, where the measured cross section is signiﬁcantly
lower than the theoretical predictions. This discrepancy
cannot be explained by the systematic uncertainties and
is therefore indicative of an issue with the theoretical
models. Speciﬁcally, high cos θµ correspond to low mo-
mentum transfer events which were previously observed
to not be well reproduced by theory in inclusive reac-
tions [15, 16] and is now also seen in exclusive reactions.
We note that the high cos θµ bin has large beam-related
background (Bn in Eq. 1), that is estimated using the
GENIE v2.12.2 based MC simulation (see supplementary
materials).

As the diﬀerential cross sections in proton kinemat-
ics and muon momentum include contributions from all
muon scattering angles, their agreement with the theoret-
ical calculation is aﬀected by this disagreement. Fig. 2
shows this comparison between the relevant cross sec-
tions in the full available phase-space (top) and in the
case where events with cos θµ > 0.8 are excluded (bot-
tom). Removing this part of the phase-space signiﬁcantly
improves the agreement between data and theory.

Table I also lists the χ2 for the agreement of the dif-
ferent models with the data for diﬀerential cross sections
for the full available phase-space and for cos θµ < 0.8.
Systematic uncertainties and correlations were accounted
for using covariance matrices. The χ2 values reported in
the table are the simple sum of those χ2 values obtained
for each distribution separately. As can be seen GENIE
v3.0.6 is the only model that reaches a χ2/d.o.f. close to
unity for the full phase-space. It is also the closest model
to the data at the highest cos θµ bin. For all other mod-
els, the χ2/d.o.f. in the cos θµ < 0.8 sample is reduced by
a factor of ∼ 2 as compared to the full phase-space sam-
ple. GENIE v3.0.6 shows a smaller reduction in this case,
and GiBUU 2019 obtains a consistently higher χ2/d.o.f.
for both the full and limited phase-space samples.

The improved agreement with the data observed for
GENIE v3.0.6, especially for the full phase-space sam-
ple, is intriguing. Speciﬁcally, GENIE v3.0.6 and NEUT
v5.4.0 are quite similar, using the same nuclear, QE, and
MEC models, which are the most signiﬁcant processes in
our energy range. They do diﬀer in the coulomb correc-
tions that only GENIE v3.0.6 has, their free parameter
tuning process, and the implementation of RPA correc-

transfer [45]. Our data indicates that these seemingly
small diﬀerences can have a highly signiﬁcant impact, as
seen in table I.

Lastly, Fig. 3 shows the ﬂux-integrated single diﬀer-
ential cross sections as a function of calorimetric mea-
sured energy and reconstructed momentum transfer, with
and without events with cos θµ > 0.8. The former is

trino momentum. Ecal
is often used as a proxy for the
reconstructed neutrino energy.

Overall, good agreement is observed between data and
calculations for these complex variables, even for the full
event sample without the cos θµ < 0.8 requirement.

In summary, we report the ﬁrst measurement of νµ
CCQE–like diﬀerential cross sections on 40Ar for event
topologies with a single muon and a single proton de-
tected in the ﬁnal state. The data are in good agreement
with GENIE predictions, except at small muon scattering
angles that correspond to low momentum-transfer reac-
tions. This measurement conﬁrms and constrains calcu-
lations essential for the extraction of oscillation parame-
ters and highlights kinematic regimes where improvement
of theoretical models is required. The benchmarking of
exclusive CC1p0π cross sections on 40Ar presented here
suggests that measurements of CC1p0π interactions are
