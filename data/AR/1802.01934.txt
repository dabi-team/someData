An easy procedure to build up membrane-electrode assemblies for applications dedicated to miniaturized PEMFC 
using H2 or CH3OH by a two-steps atmospheric plasma process is reported. Firstly, catalyst nanoparticles are 
grafted on carbon substrates by spraying a Pt colloidal solution in the post-discharge of an RF atmospheric plasma 
torch. In the second step, the resulting decorated electrodes are covered by plasma synthesized polymeric 
membranes in the discharge of a DBD. The sulfonated polystyrene membranes are synthesized by injecting 
simultaneously styrene and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid monomers, in the presence of a carrier gas (Ar or He). 
The membranes are chemically characterized by XPS, ToF-SIMS, and FTIR (IRRAS) and their deposition rate is 
investigated by SEM. 

1. Introduction 

Fuel cells are subject to a widespread enthusiasm as they constitute an alternative to conventional batteries and accumulators, and 

allow us to bring complementary solutions to fossil energies.[1] Many studies have been conducted for several years in order to optimize 

the triple contact of the fuel cells (arrival of the gases/ionomer/catalyst) by improving the different interfaces and to reduce the price 

of the different elements constituting the cell. Plasma processes for the synthesis of the membranes and electrodes are a major asset 

because  the  microstructural  and  chemical  properties  of  the  plasma-membranes  (chemical  composition,  structure,  morphology, 

thickness,  etc.)  and  the  plasma-electrodes  are  closely  linked  to  the  deposition  conditions.  Moreover,  these  environmental-friendly 

processes could reduce the amount of noble metal for the electrodes, while preserving the same electrical performances. Also, they 

allow the synthesis of thin ion-exchange membranes in one single step, contrary to liquid phase-based methods [2–4] which require 

multiple steps, organic solvents, reactants, and long reaction times. This synthesis is especially adapted to microfuel cells supplied in 

methanol  or  hydrogen  dedicated  to  the  electronic  market  (notebooks,  cameras,  mobile  phones,  small  robots,  etc.).  Moreover,  the 

strong  adherence  of  the  plasma-membranes  onto  electrodes  constitutes  an  advantage  for  the  intimate  contact  between  the 

catalyst/membrane/arrival of the reactants where the redox reactions take place in the cell. 

The  studies  relative  to  the  synthesis  by  ‘‘Plasma  Enhanced  Chemical  Vapor  Deposition’’  (PECVD)  of  thin  ionic  membranes  from  a 

polymerizable monomer (fluorocarbon or hydrocarbon backbone monomer) mixed with sulfonation agents (trifluoromethanesulfonic 

acid, chlorosulfonic acid, sulfur dioxide, etc.) are generally carried out at low pressure in order to stabilize the species and the plasma 

discharge. [5–13] 

In our work, plasma-polymerized sulfonated polystyrene (pp-sulfonated PS) was synthesized in one single step from a mixture of styrene 

and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3-SO3H) in the discharge of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) under sub-atmospheric pressure.

In  addition  to  the  PECVD  of  the  membranes  on  usual  substrates  (as  silicon)  for  chemical  characterization,  membrane-electrode 

assemblies were performed by a two-steps plasma process. 

Firstly,  catalyst  nanoparticles  were  grafted  on  carbon  substrates  by  spraying  a  Pt  colloidal  solution  in  the  post-discharge  of  an  RF 

atmospheric  plasma  torch  (according  to  previous  papers  and  patent  from  our  team).[14–18]  This  fast  and  easy  method  allows  the 

surface activation and the surface decoration in only one step. The activation of carbon substrates due to plasma exposure is usually 

based on the grafting of oxidized species but also on the formation of structural surface defects due to ion and electron bombardment, 

which can, in turn, be functionalized.[17] This step is often carried out by means of wet chemistry techniques.[19] In other cases, the 

activation of the surface and the grafting of metal particles are combined with techniques requiring a high vacuum system (ion gun, low 

pressure  plasma,  and/or  thermal  evaporation).[20]  Secondly,  plasma-polymer  membranes  were  deposited  onto  the  Pt-plasma-

decorated electrodes directly in the DBD, operating at sub-atmospheric pressure, as described previously. 

As  the  two-steps  process  could  be  easily  combined  in  one  continuous  procedure  and  as  it  leads  to  a  strong  contact  between  the 

membrane and the catalytic phase, the perspective to constitute a financially viable alternative compared to the industrial synthesis of 

the Nafion is appealing. Moreover, the Nafion presents disadvantages as permeability of the fuel, low temperature limit and a relatively 

high thickness (a hundred of mm) which are locks for the use of the commercial membrane in miniature devices.[1,21,22] 

Working under (sub)-atmospheric pressure presents lots of advantages: it avoids the constraints linked to a costly high-vacuum system, 

and therefore enables an easy implementation of the process in a continuous production line. However, a major drawback due to the 

high  pressure  is  the  very  small  mean  free  path  of  the  reactive  species,  making  the  reaction  mechanisms  much  more  difficult  to 

understand, and therefore to control. The pp-sulfonated PS obtained by plasma copolymerization were chemically characterized by X-

ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS),  infrared  reflection  absorption  spectroscopy  (IRRAS), and  by  dynamic  and  static  time-of-flight 

secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The deposition rate was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal 

stability  and  the  ability  to  exchange  ions  (after  soaking  in  an  electrolyte  solution)  were  investigated  by  XPS.  The  carbon  substrates 

decorated by Pt nanoparticles were characterized by XPS, static ToF-SIMS, and SEM. Dynamic ToF-SIMS and SEM were used to observe 

the different interfaces of the pp-sulfonated PS deposited onto glassy carbon decorated by Pt nanoparticles. 

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Materials 

The liquid styrene (Fluka, purity: 99.5%) and the liquid trifluoromethane sulfonic acid precursors (Sigma–Aldrich, purity >98%) were 

used as received for the plasma polymerization, without any further purification. This acid being very hygroscopic, it requires a closed 

system  with  a  controlled  atmosphere.  The  Pt  nanoparticles  were  provided  by  Plasmachem.  They  were  sterically  stabilized  by 

polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and showed a size distribution of 3–4nm in diameter. Once diluted in methanol, the resulting solution was 

used for the first step of the process. 

Silicon wafers (100) from Compart Technology Ltd. were selected as flat substrates for surface characterizations and for the deposition 

rates  study  of  the  pp-sulfonated  PS.  Glassy  carbon  (non-porous) and  Carbon  Toray  Paper  (porous)  were  used  for  the  grafting  of  Pt 

Plasma Processes & Polymers, 2012, Vol. 9, Issue 11-12, 1144-1153, http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppap.201100208

catalyst and then for the membrane synthesis (membrane-electrode assembly). Glassy carbon (Sigradur K platen) was chosen to this 

end as a model for the depth profiling by dynamic SIMS. The substrates were cleaned with methanol and isooctane. The atmospheric 

plasma torch used for the grafting of the metallic nanoparticles was sustained by Ar (‘‘Air liquide’’, purity: 99.999%), mixed with oxygen 

(‘‘Air liquide’’, purity: 99.995%). The DBD for the plasma-polymer synthesis was sustained either by He (‘‘Air liquide’’, purity: 99.999%) 

or by Ar (‘‘Air liquide’’, purity: 99.999%). 

2.2. Nanoparticles Grafting 

The catalyst nanoparticles were deposited on carbon gas diffusion layers (Carbon Toray Paper) and on glassy carbon by spraying the Pt 

colloidal solution in the post-discharge of an RF atmospheric plasma torch. The plasma torch (Atomflo250DSurfX Technologies) consists 

of two closely spaced circular aluminum electrodes perforated to flush the process gas (Ar) at a flow rate of 30 L.min-1. To improve the 

grafting process on the carbon substrates, a tiny flow rate of oxygen (20mL.min-1) was mixed with the carrier gas, as already highlighted 

for the grafting of Au, Rh, and Pt nanoparticles in the Nano2hybrids project. [15]

We have carried out several configurations (variation of the angle between the substrate and the gas flow direction, injection of the 

colloidal solution out of the post-discharge, etc.). The best configuration resulted from the best compromise between a high amount of 

nanoparticles grafted and a low oxidation of the Pt nanoparticles, as illustrated in Figure 1. The substrate, parallel to the gases flow 

direction, is fixed on a rotative cylindrical stick of 10mm in diameter and placed at 2mm from the plasma torch exit. The substrates were 

activated during 2min (30 L.min–1 Ar, 20mL.min–1 O2 at 80W). Then the Pt colloidal solution was nebulized in the afterglow of the plasma 

torch during 3min (20 sprays of 0.17mL). After the 3min of Pt grafting, a termination step is operated under the same conditions without 

any spraying of platinum (during 2min).

2.3. Plasma Polymerization 

The pp-sulfonated PS thin films were deposited in one single step, in a home-built DBD. The cylindrical glass chamber has already been 

detailed in previous papers. [23,24] The schematic diagram of the reactor is presented in Figure 2. Although the system also runs under 

atmospheric pressure, the results presented in this paper were obtained at a slightly reduced pressure (2.104 Pa) but still in the same 

order of magnitude as atmospheric pressure, in order to be able to increase the inter-electrode distance and to minimize the breakdown 

voltage (according to the Paschen Law). The chamber was pumped continuously during the plasma polymerization process (dynamic 

regime) to minimize the air contamination of the growing film. The liquid styrene monomer was kept at 313K and the temperature of 

the trifluoromethane sulfonic acid was ranging from 313 to 333 K. 

Both monomers vapors were simultaneously introduced into the discharge with identical flow rates of Ar or He (1.5 L.min–1 flowing 

through each liquid vessel). The frequency was fixed at 15 kHz and the voltage was varied from 1 to 2 kV. The silicon substrates (or the 

decorated carbon substrates) were placed between the electrodes, close to the arrival of the precursors (on the right end side of the 

21cm long bottom electrode, at 9cm from its center, as shown in Figure 2).  Deposition times ranged from 5 to 10 min. After the plasma 

polymer deposition on Si wafers or on carbon electrodes loaded with Pt catalyst, the chamber was purged in order to evacuate  the 

reactive gas, then backfilled to atmospheric pressure using Ar or He. Finally, the samples were transferred to the analytical tools. 

2.4. Characterization of the Samples 

The pp-films were characterized by FTIR, XPS, and ToF-SIMS. The deposition rates were calculated by measuring the thickness (by cross-

section) of the pp-sulfonated PS films by means of a Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEG-SEM) Zeiss Leo 982. SEM 

was also used to  investigate the morphology of the plasma-polymerized films (with the addition of a gold coating of  about 5nm in 

thickness to make them conductive) and the deposited Pt. To evaluate the quality of the grafting, XPS analyses were performed on the 

carbon substrate decorated with the catalyst nanoparticles before and after ultrasonification in a methanol bath. 

XPS  analyses  were  carried  out  in  a  Physical  Electronics  PHI-5600  system  equipped  with  a  concentric  spherical  analyser  and  a  16 

channeltron plate. Spectra were acquired with the Mg anode (1 253.6 eV) operating at 300 W. The typical area of analysis is around 

800mm.  The  average  surface  concentrations  (excluding  hydrogen,  which  is  not  detected  in  XPS)  on  two  identical  samples  at  three 

different regions were computed on the Casa XPS software, after removal of a Shirley background line.  

The sensitivity coefficients used are: S=0.35, C=0.205, N=0.38,O=0.63, F=1,andPt=3.50, instead of 1.75 (corresponding to the singlet Pt 

4f7/2) as referred in the literature.[25] Indeed, in order to take into account all the platinum components and not to neglect the Pt (+4) 

and Pt (+2) components, we have considered the  whole spectral  envelope on the survey spectrum,  corresponding to the spin-orbit 

doublet (Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2). Therefore the compositions of the Pt decorated carbon substrates must be taken as indicative and are 

used only for comparison between the different plasma treatments (with/without oxygen, nature of the substrate, etc.). 

Wide survey spectra were acquired at a  93.9 eV pass-energy, with a 5 scan accumulation  (time/step: 50ms, eV/step: 0.8). The high 

resolution scans were acquired at a 23.5 eV pass-energy with an accumulation of 10 scans (time/step: 50ms, eV/step: 0.025). The high 

resolution  scans  of  C1s,  S2p,  and  Pt4f  were  decomposed  into  several  peaks  components,  with  the  same  FWHM  for  each,  through 
4

convoluting Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles with respect to a 30:70 ratio. The components assignments and binding energies were 

based on the literature. [9,26,27] 

Static positive and negative ToF-SIMS measurements were  performed with an ‘‘IONTOF V’’ spectrometer (IONTOF GmbH, Münster, 

Germany) equipped with a reflectron analyser and controlled by the SURFACELAB 6.1 software. The sample was bombarded in static 

regime at two different regions by pulsed Bi3

2+ (acceleration voltage=60 keV, primary ion current=0.01pA, total ion fluence=2.1013 Bi3

2+ 

 cm–2,  beam  diameter  0.3µm).  The  acquisition  time  was  fixed  to  1min  and  the  scan  was  confined  to  a  square  of  500*500µm2.  Cs+ 

(acceleration voltage=1 keV, primary ion current=100nA, total ion fluence=1,7.10–18 Cs+.cm–2, beam diameter = 0.3mm) was employed 

as primary source for the dynamic  ToF-SIMS measurements (erosion of 100*100µm2) on pp-sulfonated deposited on glassy carbon 

decorated with Pt nanoparticles. 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. pp-Sulfonated PS on Si Wafers 

Chemical Structure 

XPS is a very powerful technique to characterize thin polymer coatings.[28] Figure 3 presents the survey of pp sulfonated PS/DBD He 

and high resolution scans of S2p, C1s, O1s, and F1s. We have already shown that the synthesis of pp sulfonated PS revealed a relatively 

preserved  structure of the acid  precursor in the discharge  near  atmospheric pressure  in our plasma conditions.[23] All the sulfur is 

present in the sulfonic form (S2p1/2 and S2p3/2 at 169 and 170 eV, respectively) and no sulfur at lower oxidation state (such as RSO2R’ 

at 166 eV and RSOR’ at 164.5 eV) is incorporated into the films. These results differ from most of the deposits operated at low pressure, 

where the peak is often splitted.[5,8,9,22,29,30] 

Figure 3. XPS survey with insets showing narrow 

scans  corresponding  to  S2p,  C1s,  O1s,  F1s  of  pp-

sulfonated PS (He, 313 K for the both monomers, 1 

kV). 

The significant retention of the sulfonic acids groups suggests milder plasma conditions at sub-atmospheric pressure in our synthesis 

conditions. This better retention could be explained by lower mean free paths of the radicals, excited species (such as metastables), and 

charged species. Their collisions frequency is therefore higher but their energy could be too low to fragment the sulfonic groups.

In this previous paper, the XPS results showed that the content in sulfonated groups was tunable by varying the temperature of the acid 

monomer (so the acid-to-styrene ratio) or by increasing the voltage.[23] Therefore, it was  possible to produce  plasma-membranes, 

thermally stable, with a higher content in sulfonic acids groups (up to 4% at 1 kV and up to 6.6% at 2 kV) than in the Nafion 117 (for 

which sulfonated groups of around 1% is reported). The presence of sulfonic acid groups was also confirmed by FTIR and static SIMS.[23] 

The thermal stability was investigated by XPS from the point of view of the chemical composition and of the core level peak shape for 

the different elements of the membranes heated at 393 K in dry medium (stove) and at 353 K in aqueous medium (water bath). Owing 

to the similar elemental composition and the similar shape of the high resolution peaks before and after the heating (except for the 

oxygen peak after soaking in hot water, for which the OH/H2O component slightly increased), we can conclude that the thermal stability 

(from the point of view of the chemical composition) is correct. In an attempt to bring out the presence of easily accessible ionic sites, 

preliminary tests were operated by means of XPS on the pp-sulfonated PS immerged in an aqueous solution. They were soaked in NaOH 

0.1 M during 30 min to replace the H+ of the acid form by Na+ in order to check if our films have a similar behavior to ionic exchange 

membranes. Afterwards, those ones were rinsed by milli-Q water, dried, and analyzed by XPS. The emergence of the Na1s peak at 1 

075 eV and the Auger peak at 264 eV for the pp-sulfonated PS are clearly noticeable in Figure 4. The same treatment was applied to the 

non-sulfonated pp-PS in order to compare and confirm the ion exchange effect of the sulfonated polymer. The elemental composition 

of the reference (pp-PS) and pp-sulfonated PS after immersion in NaOH is given in Table 1. 

Analogous  tests  were  performed  by  Ogumi  on  pp-membranes  synthesized  at  low  pressure  from  trifluorochloroethylene  and 

trifluoromethanesulfonic acid after soaking in CsOH during 30 min. The presence of Cs was attested by Electron Probe Micro-Analysis 

(EPMA) afterwards.[6]

Table 1. XPS elemental composition of pp-PS and pp-sulfonated PS after immersion in NaOH. 

Deposition Rates 

Figure 5 shows a typical SEM cross-section image of pp-sulfonated PS synthesized onto silicon wafers. The films (few mm in thickness) 

are uniform and present a strong adhesion to the substrate whatever its nature. The deposition rates are given in Table 2. An increase 

in the deposition rate with the voltage is highlighted (360–580nm/min at 1 kV, against 825–1425nm/min at 1.5 kV) owing to an increase 

of  the  fragmentation  and  the  amount  of  activated  precursors.  Therefore,  the  polymerization  by  random  radical  recombination  is 

increased. Moreover, the films synthesized in the presence of Ar instead of He show a slightly higher deposition rate due to the more 

filamentary behavior of the Ar discharge.

Si wafers in the presence of Ar or He (313 K for the both monomers).

3.2. Nanoparticles Grafting on Carbon Substrates 

Chemical Structure 

The configuration illustrated in Figure 1 displays a good compromise between a high amount of Pt grafted and a low oxidation of the Pt 

nanoparticles. After any plasma treatment (with or without O2), Pt nanoparticles were detected by XPS on the carbon surface; the fitted 

Pt and C high resolution peaks are presented in Figure 6 and 7, respectively. 

Table 3 exhibits the elemental compositions of the metallic grafting on glassy carbon after ultrasonication and also on Carbon Toray 

Paper before and after ultrasonication. For comparison, the table indicates the composition of Carbon Toray Paper used as a substrate 

for the decoration of Pt nanoparticles in a pure argon discharge. Due to its significant porosity (78%), the amount of Pt detected on 

Carbon Toray Paper is lower than on glassy carbon. As the Carbon Toray Paper is a non-flat surface, the Pt nanoparticles are grafted 

over an indeterminate thickness, supposed to be higher than the depth probed by XPS analysis (10 nm). 

Plasma Processes & Polymers, 2012, Vol. 9, Issue 11-12, 1144-1153, http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppap.201100208

Table 3. XPS elemental composition before and after ultrasonication of the surface of glassy carbon (GC) and Carbon Toray Paper (CT) after grafting 

of Pt nanoparticles by means of the atmospheric plasma torch. 

The incorporated oxygen is mostly due to the addition of oxygen gas (20mL.min–1) into the Ar post-discharge (30 L.min–1), to the opened 

environment in which the RF torch is working and to the colloidal solution. The silicon contamination (evidenced by XPS) may be due to 

the sprayer system. The small amount of nitrogen could be due to the capping agent of the Pt nanoparticles (PVP) and to the ambient 

air. The benefit of adding oxygen in the plasma was pointed out in previous publications.[15,16] As can be seen in Table 3, the amount 

of  nanoparticles  grafted  is  lower  when  no  oxygen  was  added  (less  active  sites)  and  the  bonds  become  weaker  (the  quantity  of  Pt 

decreased after ultrasonication by a factor close to 2). 

As the amount of platinum (when oxygen is added) was similar before and after ultrasonication, a strong adhesion of the nanoparticles 

to the carbon substrates is suggested. The activation of carbon substrates was argued in the Nano2hybrids project (especially by the 

way of simulation of grafting Au on carbon nanotubes).[17,31] The nucleation takes place preferentially on ‘‘defects’’ or on active sites 

(such as oxygenated vacancies)  generated by  plasma  preactivation.  Those ones trap metallic atoms and play the role  of  nucleation 

centers. Therefore, the density of defects influences the dispersion and the concentration of metal nanoparticles grafted and allows to 

adapt  the  interfacial  properties.  Therefore,  thanks  to  the  plasma  activation,  the  distribution  of  the  oxygenated  vacancies  is  more 

homogeneous and leads to the grafting of a tunable concentration of nanoparticles.

In Figure 7a, the fitting of the Pt 4f core level (Pt4f5/2–Pt4f7/2 spin-orbit doublets with 3.3 eV energy separation) was based on a method 

suggested by Croy.[32] The fitting for our deposits showed that the Pt was mostly present under metallic state for this configuration: 

about 70% of Pt (0), about 20% of Pt (+2), and less than 10% of Pt (+4). We should mention also that we have tested other plasma-spray-

substrate configurations. Other configurations allow us to obtain more oxidized Pt. Depending on the geometry, the oxidation state of 

the platinum is tunable, which could play a role on the methanol oxidation reaction catalysis in the cell.[32] The fitting of the C1s peak 

is based on a method proposed by Swaraj.[33] The C1s high resolution scans evidenced the presence of carbon-oxygen species. As we 

can see in Figure 7b, the C spectrum was fitted in four components. C-O species are detected since during the plasma treatment, the 

sample was exposed to a strong oxidizing atmosphere including the ambient air, the injection of methanol droplets, and the addition of 

oxygen to the Ar gas. 

Figure 7. Decomposition of the Pt4f (a) and C1s (b) XPS peaks for a grafting of Pt nanoparticles on glassy carbon after ultrasonication. 

The topmost surface of glassy carbon and Carbon Toray Paper decorated by nanoparticles was characterized by static SIMS. Figure 8 

displays the positive and the negative Static SIMS spectra of glassy carbon decorated with Pt nanoparticles (in the presence of oxygen 

added in the postdischarge). The positive spectrum shows the existence of the following peaks: Pt+, PtO+, PtO2

+, PtCl2

+,, PtCl4

+, Pt2

+, 

Pt2Ox

+, Pt3

+, Pt3Ox

+, CH3NH3

+, NH4

+ (after grafting of the metallic particles), in addition to other peaks present on the surface of the native 

sample like aliphatics,CxHyO+,H2O+,Na+,Al+, Si+, CO+, NO+, K+, Ar+, and Ca+, as confirmed in the literature.[34] The chlorine (non-visible in 

XPS spectra) could originate from the synthesis method of the nanoparticles. The nitrogen compounds come from the PVP used as a 

capping agent and from the ambient air. In the negative spectrum, peaks of C–, CH–, OH–, C2H–, CN–, Cl–, CNO–, CO2H–, C4H–, SO2

– , SO3

–, 

HSO4

– (already present in the native sample) but also peaks of PO3

– , PtO–, PtO2

– , PtCl–, PtCl2

–, Pt2Ox

–, Pt3Ox

Morphology (SEM) 

The SEM pictures shown in Figure 9 correspond to the glassy carbon substrate (a) as received and (b) decorated by Pt nanoclusters by 

the means of the RF plasma torch. In Figure 9b, an increase in the roughness is observed due to the grafting of the nanoclusters, which 

appear as white dots uniformly distributed. As a high loading leads to a more important coalescence process, the structure of the deposit 

is strongly related to the loading in Pt nanoparticles at the glassy carbon surface.

3.3. pp-Sulfonated PS on Electrodes 

Chemical Structure 

The pp-sulfonated PS synthesized on Pt nanoparticles deposited on carbon substrates were chemically characterized by XPS and by 

static ToF-SIMS. As those surface characterization results were similar to the previous ones operated on silicon wafers, they have not 

been repeated here. In order to determine the bulk homogeneity of the membranes and to have access to the membrane–catalyst and 

catalyst–carbon interfaces, dynamic ToF-SIMS depth profiling has been performed. The evolution of the dynamic ToF-SIMS negative 

fragments as a function of the erosion time for the pp-sulfonated membranes on glassy carbon loaded with Pt clusters is shown in Figure 

10. 

Figure 10. (a) Evolution of the negative dynamic ToF-SIMS fragments from pp-sulfonated PS (DBD Ar, 313 K for the two monomers, 1 kV, 3 min) 

deposited on glassy carbon decorated with Pt nanoparticles versus the time of erosion; (b) zoom of (a) for the low intensity fragments. 

Figure 10 shows that the sulfonic acid groups were homogeneously grafted inside the whole membrane (fragments at m/z=157 and 183 

corresponding  to  C6H5SO3

–  and  C8H7SO3

–,  respectively).  The  non-fragmented  trifluoromethanesulfonic  acid  monomer  (m/z=149)  is 

mostly adsorbed at the ‘‘plasma-membrane’’/‘‘Pt nanoparticles’’ interface due to the two monomers injected before the breakdown of 

the  plasma  in  the  DBD  chamber  and  the  polymerization  process.  The  fluorine  coming  from  the  fragmentation  of  the 

trifluoromethanesulfonic acid follows the same trend. The polymeric film/Pt and Pt/glassy carbon interfaces are particularly visible; the 

carbon components without nitrogen decrease during the erosion of the nanoparticles and increase when the Pt nanoparticles have 

totally disappeared. The CNO– peak at m/z=42 (from the capping agent of the colloidal solution) and oxygen (after the achievement of 

a plateau in the plasma-film) increase similarly to the Pt. The oxygen bond to the Pt comes from the tiny flow of oxygen added to the 

Ar plasma, from the solution and from the open environment. 

Morphology (SEM) 

Figure  11a  shows  the  SEM  pictures  of  the  top  view  of  scratched  pp-sulfonated  PS  synthesized  on  glassy  carbon  loaded  in  metallic 

catalyst.  The  plasma-polymer  is  flat  and  homogeneous.  Figure  11b  shows  the  cross-section  of  the  same  deposit.  Pt  clusters, 

homogenously distributed and clearly visible at the interface (as confirmed by the dynamic ToF-SIMS results), appear bright (effect of 

the atomic number).

4. Conclusion 

We tried to show, in this paper, that atmospheric pressure plasma is a potential useful tool for building membrane-catalyst-electrode 

assemblies for fuel cell applications. It presents the advantage of being an easy-to-set-up process that does not require complicated 

technology or involve complex chemical reaction schemes. 

Thermally stable pp-sulfonated PS coatings have been successfully synthesized by means of a home-built DBD, in one single step, by 

‘‘copolymerization’’ of two precursors (styrene and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) injected simultaneously into the discharge. These 

coatings could play the role of ion-exchange membranes in miniaturized PEMFC, using hydrogen or methanol for portable applications. 

The complementarity of the spectroscopic techniques (XPS, FTIR, static and dynamic SIMS) showed that the sulfonic acid groups were 

well preserved in the discharge near atmospheric pressure and also grafted inside the whole polystyrene membrane. The influence of 

the parameters (temperature of the acid, voltage applied between the electrodes, nature of the carrier gas, etc.) on the amount of the 

grafted ionizable groups was monitored by XPS, which showed a higher content than in the Nafion 117 (up to4% at 1 kV and up to 6.6% 

at 2 kV versus about 1% for the Nafion). The presence of ionic sites was also pointed out by means of the Na signal followed by XPS after 

soaking the membranes in a solution of NaOH to change its form. 

In  order  to  develop  membrane-electrode  assembly  by  atmospheric  plasma,  these  films  were  also  deposited  directly  onto  carbon 

substrates decorated with platinum. We have grafted the catalyst from a platinum colloidal solution sprayed into the post-discharge of 

an RF atmospheric plasma torch on gas diffusion layers and on glassy carbon (used as a model for the depth profiling by dynamic SIMS) 

in several configurations and for different parameters. The amount of Pt grafted on carbon substrates and the oxidation states of the 

Pt can be tuned depending on the configurations. This one-step process is a promising technique to deposit nanocatalysts for fuel cells 

applications due to its easy transferability to industrial process. 

The aim of this process was to constitute electrodes that will be used afterwards as substrates for the adhesion of plasma-membranes 

as part of membrane-electrode assemblies for fuel cells. Thedifferent interfaces of themembraneelectrode assembly are clearly visible, 

detected, and characterized by depth profiling (dynamic ToF-SIMS) and SEM.
