Abstract

Recently, AutoRegressive (AR) models for the whole image generation empowered by transformers have achieved
comparable or even better performance to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unfortunately, directly applying
such AR models to edit/change local image regions, may suﬀer from the problems of missing global information,
slow inference speed, and information leakage of local guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
model – image Local Autoregressive Transformer (iLAT), to better facilitate the locally guided image synthesis. Our
iLAT learns the novel local discrete representations, by the newly proposed local autoregressive (LA) transformer of
the attention mask and convolution mechanism. Thus iLAT can eﬃciently synthesize the local image regions by key
guidance information. Our iLAT is evaluated on various locally guided image syntheses, such as pose-guided person
image synthesis and face editing. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show the eﬃcacy of our model.

1. Introduction

Generating realistic images has been attracting ubiquitous research attention of the community for a long time.
In particular, those image synthesis tasks involving persons or portrait [6, 28, 29] can be applied in a wide variety of
scenarios, such as advertising, games, and motion capture, etc. Most real-world image synthesis tasks only involve
the local generation, which means generating pixels in certain regions, while maintaining the semantic consistency,
e.g., face editing [19, 1, 40], pose guiding [36, 55, 47], and image inpainting [51, 30, 49, 53]. Unfortunately, most
works can only handle the well aligned images of ‘icon-view’ foregrounds, rather than the image synthesis of
‘non-iconic view’ foregrounds [47, 24], i.e., person instances with arbitrary poses in cluttered scenes, which is
concerned in this paper. Even worse, the global semantics tend to be distorted during the generation of previous
methods, even if subtle modiﬁcations are applied to a local image region. Critically, given the local editing/guidance
such as sketches of faces, or skeleton of bodies in the ﬁrst column of Fig. 1(A), it is imperative to design our new
algorithm for locally guided image synthesis.

Generally, several inherent problems exist in previous works for such a task. For example, despite impressive
quality of images are generated, GANs/Autoencoder(AE)-based methods [51, 47, 19, 30, 18] are inclined to synthesize
blurry local regions, as in Fig. 1(A)-row(c). Furthermore, some inspiring autoregressive (AR) methods, such as
PixelCNN [32, 41, 23] and recent transformers [8, 14], should eﬃciently model the joint image distribution (even
in very complex background [32]) for whole image generation as Fig. 1(B)-row(b). These AR models, however,
are still not ready for locally guided image synthesis, as several reasons. (1) Missing global information. As in
Fig. 1(B)-row(b), vanilla AR models take the top-to-down and left-to-right sequential generation with limited
receptive ﬁelds for the initial generating (top left corner), which are incapable of directly modeling global information.
Additionally, the sequential AR models suﬀer from exposure bias [2], which may predict future pixels conditioned
on the past ones with mistakes, due to the discrepancy between training and testing in AR. This makes small local
guidance unpredictable changes to the whole image, resulting in inconsistent semantics as in Fig. 1(A)-row(a). (2)
Slow inference speed. The AR models have to sequentially predict the pixels in the testing with notoriously slow
inference speed, especially for high-resolution image generation. Although the parallel training techniques are used
in pixelCNN [32] and transformer [14], the conditional probability sampling fails to work in the inference phase. (3)

based method in the local generation, and (B) comparison of AE, AR, and our iLAT for diﬀerent conditional image
generations. Our method is more eﬃcient for locally guided image synthesis by keeping both global semantics and
local guidance.

Information leakage of local guidance. As shown in Fig. 1(B)-row(c), the local guidance should be implemented with
speciﬁc masks to ensure the validity of the local AR learning. During the sequential training process, pixels from
masked regions may be exposed to AR models by convolutions with large kernel sizes or inappropriate attention
masks in the transformer. We call it information leakage [44, 16] of local guidance, which makes models overﬁt the
masked regions, and miss detailed local guidance as in Fig. 1(A)-row(b).

To this end, we propose a novel image Local Autoregressive Transformer (iLAT) for the task of locally guided
image synthesis. Our key idea lies in learning the local discrete representations eﬀectively. Particularly, we
tailor the receptive ﬁelds of AR models to local guidance, achieving semantically consistent and visually realistic
generation results. Furthermore, a local autoregressive (LA) transformer with the novel LA attention mask and
convolution mechanism is proposed to enable successful local generation of images with eﬃcient inference time,
without information leakage.

Formally, we propose the iLAT model with several novel components. (1) We complementarily incorporate
receptive ﬁelds of both AR and AE to ﬁt LA generation with a novel attention mask as shown in Fig. 1(B)-row(c).
In detail, local discrete representation is proposed to represent those masked regions, while the unmasked areas are
encoded with continuous image features. Thus, we achieve favorable results with both consistent global semantics
and realistic local generations. (2) Our iLAT dramatically reduces the inference time for local generation, since
only masked regions will be generated autoregressively. (3) A simple but eﬀective two-stream convolution and a
local causal attention mask mechanism are proposed for discrete image encoder and transformer respectively, with
which information leakage is prevented without detriment to the performance.

We make several contributions in this work. (1) A novel local discrete representation learning is proposed to
eﬃciently help to learn our iLAT for the local generation. (2) We propose an image local autoregressive transformer
for local image synthesis, which enjoys both semantically consistent and realistic generative results. (3) Our iLAT
only generates necessary regions autoregressively, which is much faster than vanilla AR methods during the inference.
(4) We propose a two-stream convolution and a LA attention mask to prevent both convolutions and transformer
from information leakage, thus improving the quality of generated images. Empirically, we introduce several locally
guidance tasks, including pose-guided image generation and face editing tasks; and extensive experiments are

2. Related Work

Conditional Image Synthesis. Some conditional generation models are designed to globally generate images with
pre-deﬁned styles based on user-provided references, such as poses and face sketches. These previous synthesis eﬀorts
are made on Variational auto-encoder (VAE) [10, 13], AR Model [48, 39], and AE with adversarial training [51, 49, 53].
Critically, it is very non-trivial for all these methods to generate images of locally guided image synthesis of the
non-iconic foreground. Some tentative attempts have been conducted in pose-guided synthesis [42, 47] with person
existing in non-ironic views. On the other hand, face editing methods are mostly based on adversarial AE based
inpainting [30, 51, 19] and GAN inversion based methods [53, 40, 1]. Rather than synthesizing the whole image,
our iLAT generates the local regions of images autoregressively, which not only improves the stability with the
well-optimized joint conditional distribution for large masked regions but also maintains the global semantic
information.
Autoregressive Generation. The deep AR models have achieved great success recently in the community [35,
15, 32, 9, 38]. Some well known works include PixelRNN [43], Conditional PixelCNN [32], Gated PixelCNN [32],
and WaveNet [31]. Recently, transformer based AR models [38, 5, 12] have achieved excellent results in many
machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, the common troubles of these AR models are the expensive inference time
and potential exposure bias, as AR models sequentially predict future values from the given past values. The
inconsistent receptive ﬁelds for training and testing will lead to accumulated errors and unreasonable generated
results [2]. Our iLAT is thus designed to address these limitations.
Visual Transformer. The transformer takes advantage of the self-attention module [44], and shows impressive
expressive power in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) [38, 11, 5] and vision tasks [12, 7, 25]. With costly
time and space complexity of O(n2) in transformers, Parmar et al. [34] utilize local self-attention to achieve AR
generated results. Chen et al. [8] and Kumar et al. [22] autoregressively generate pixels with simpliﬁed discrete
color palettes to save computations. But limited by the computing power, they still generate low-resolution images.
To address this, some works have exploited the discrete representation learning, e.g. dVAE [39] and VQGAN [14].
It not only reduces the sequence length of image tokens but also shares perceptually rich latent features in image
synthesis as the word embedding in NLP. However, recovering images from the discrete codebook still causes blur
and artifacts in complex scenes. Besides, vanilla convolutions of the discrete encoder may leak information among
diﬀerent discrete codebook tokens. Moreover, local conditional generation based on VQGAN [14] suﬀers from poor
semantical consistency compared with other unchanged image regions. To end these, the iLAT proposes the novel
discrete representation to improve the model capability of local image synthesis.

3. Approach

Given the conditional image Ic and target image It, our image Local Autoregressive Transformer (iLAT) aims
at producing the output image Io of semantically consistent and visually realistic. The key foreground objects
(e.g., the skeleton of body), or the regions of interest (e.g., sketches of facial regions) extracted from Ic, are applied
to guide the synthesis of output image Io. Essentially, the background and the other non-key foreground image
regions of Io should be visually similar to It. As shown in Fig. 2, our iLAT includes the branches of Two-Stream
convolutions based Vector Quantized GAN (TS-VQGAN) for the discrete representation learning and a transformer
for the AR generation with Local Autoregressive (LA) attention mask. Particularly, our iLAT ﬁrstly encodes Ic
and It, into codebook vectors zq,c and zq,t by TS-VQGAN (Sec. 3.1) without local information leakage. Then the
index of the masked vectors ˆzq,t will be predicted by the transformer autoregressively with LA attention mask
(Sec. 3.2). During the test phase, the decoder of TS-VQGAN takes the combination of ˆzq,t in masked regions and ˆz
in unmasked regions to achieve the ﬁnal result.

3.1. Local Discrete Representation Learning

We propose a novel local discrete representation learning in this section. Since it is ineﬃcient to learn the
generative transformer model through pixels directly, inspired by VQGAN [14], we incorporate the VQVAE
mechanism [33] into the proposed iLAT for the discrete representation learning. The VQVAE is consisted of an
encoder E, a decoder D, and a learnable discrete codebook Z = {zk}K
k=1, where K means the total number of
codebook vectors. Given an image I ∈ RH×W ×3, E encodes the image into latent features ˆz = E(I) ∈ Rh×w×ce,

3

Figure 2: The overview of iLAT with 3 × 3 of latent quantization. The target image It is encoded by TS-VQGAN
with a binary mask M, while conditional image Ic is directly encoded without mask. As explained in Sec.3.2,
the guided information of poses and sketches are utilized in our two tasks. For pose guidence, target pose
coordinates are encoded by a PointMLP into sequential features, which are concatenated with conditional tokens
{c[s], c0, ..., c8, cpose}. The TS-VQGAN decoder takes the combination of ˆzq,t converted from generated target
tokens {ˆt1, ˆt2, ..., ˆt7} in masked regions and directly encoded features ˆz in unmasked regions to get the ﬁnal result.

where ce indicates the channel of the encoder outputs. Then, the spatially unfolded ˆzh(cid:48)w(cid:48) ∈ Rce , (h(cid:48) ∈ h, w(cid:48) ∈ w)
are replaced with the closest codebook vectors as

z(q)
h(cid:48)w(cid:48) = arg min
zk∈Z

||ˆzh(cid:48)w(cid:48) − zk|| ∈ Rcq ,

zq = fold(z(q)

h(cid:48)w(cid:48), h(cid:48) ∈ h, w(cid:48) ∈ w) ∈ Rh×w×cq ,

(1)

where cq indicates the codebook channels. However, VQVAE will suﬀer from obscure information leakage for the
local image synthesis, if the receptive ﬁeld (kernel size) of vanilla convolution is larger than 1 × 1 as shown in
Fig. 3(a). Intuitively, each 3 × 3 convolution layer spreads the masked features to the outside border of the mask.
Furthermore, multi-convolutional based E accumulates the information leakage, which makes the model learn the
local generating with unreasonable conﬁdence, leading to model overﬁtting (see Sec. 4.3).

To this end, we present two-stream convolutions in TS-VQGAN as shown in Fig. 3(a). Since the masked
information is only leaked to a circle around the mask with each 3 × 3 convolution layer, we can just replace the
corrupt features for each layer with masked ones. Thus, the inﬂuence of information leakage will be eliminated
without hurting the integrity of both masked and unmasked features. Speciﬁcally, for the given image mask
M ∈ RH×W that 1 means masked regions, and 0 means unmasked regions, it should be resized into M(cid:48) with
max-pooling to ﬁt the feature size. The two-stream convolution converts the input feature F into the masked
feature Fm = F (cid:12) (1 − M(cid:48)), where (cid:12) is element-wise multiplication. Then, both F and Fm are convoluted with
shared weights and combined according to the leaked regions Ml, which can be obtained from the diﬀerence of
convoluted mask as

Ml = clip(conv1(M(cid:48)), 0, 1) − M(cid:48), Ml[Ml > 0] = 1,
where conv1 implemented with an all-one 3 × 3 kernel. Therefore, the output of two-stream convolution can be
written as

(2)

Fc = conv(F) (cid:12) (1 − Ml) + conv(Fm) (cid:12) Ml.
So the leaked regions are replaced with features that only depend on unmasked regions. Besides, masked features
can be further leveraged for AR learning without any limitations. Compared with VQVAE, we replace all vanilla

regions to unmasked regions. Patches with leaked information are circled with red. For (b), a 3 × 3 quantized mask
Mq is assumed as the input mask. MLA can be divided into the global sub-mask Mgs and the causal sub-mask
Mcs. Then, t[s], t3, t8 can be categorized into global pixel tokens, while others are casual tokens: t1, t2, t5, t7 are
masked tokens tm, (Mq,m = 1), and t0, t1, t4, t6 are tokens tm−1 that need to predict masked ones. The global
tokens can be attended with all tokens. And causal tokens attend to the targets with a lower triangular matrix. All

convolutions with two-stream convolutions in the encoder of TS-VQGAN. Note that the decoder D is unnecessary
to prevent information leakage at all. Since the decoding process is implemented after the AR generating of the
transformer as shown in Fig. 2.

For the VQVAE, the decoder D decodes the codebook vectors zq got from Eq.(1), and reconstructs the output
image as Io = D(zq). Although VQGAN [14] can generate more reliable textures with adversarial training, handling
complex real-world backgrounds and precise face details is still tough to the existed discrete learning methods. In
TS-VQGAN, we further ﬁnetune the model with local quantized learning, which can be written as

Io = D(zq (cid:12) Mq + ˆz (cid:12) (1 − Mq)),

(4)

where Mq ∈ Rh×w is the resized mask for quantized vectors, and ˆz is the output of the encoder. In Eq.(4), unmasked
features are directly encoded from the encoder, while masked features are replaced with the codebook vectors,
which works between AE and VQVAE. This simple trick eﬀectively maintains the ﬁdelity of the unmasked regions
and reduces the number of quantized vectors that have to be generated autoregressively, which also leads to a more
eﬃcient local AR inference. Note that the back-propagation of Eq.( 4) is implemented with the straight-through
gradient estimator [4].

3.2. Local Autoregressive Transformer Learning

From the discrete representation learning in Sec. 3.1, we can get the discrete codebook vectors zq,c, zq,t ∈ Rh×w×cq
for conditional images and target images respectively. Then the conditional and target image tokens {ci, tj}hw
i,j=1 ∈
{0, 1, ..., K − 1} can be converted from the index-based representation of zq,c, zq,t in the codebook with length
hw, where K indicates the all number of codebook vectors. For the resized target mask Mq ∈ Rh×w, the second
stage needs to learn the AR likelihood for the masked target tokens {tm} where Mq,m = 1 with conditional tokens
{ci}hw

i=1 and other unmasked target tokens {tu} where Mq,u = 0 as

(4), iLAT only needs to generate masked target tokens {tm} rather than all. Then, the negative
log likelihood (NLL) loss can be optimized as

LN LL = −Etm∼p(tm|c,tu) log p(tm|c, tu).

(6)

We use a decoder-only transformer to handle the AR likelihood. As shown in Fig. 2, two special tokens c[s], t[s] are
concatenated to {ci} and {tj} as start tokens respectively. Then, the trainable position embedding [11] is added
to the token embedding to introduce the position information to the self-attention modules. According to the
self-attention mechanism in the transformer, the attention mask is the key factor to achieve parallel training without
information leakage. As shown in Fig. 3(b), we propose a novel LA attention mask ˆMLA with four sub-masks,
which indicate condition to condition (C2C), condition to target (C2T), target to condition (T2C), and target to
target (T2T) respectively. All conditional tokens {ci}hw
i=1 can be attended by themselves and targets. So C2C and
T2C should be all-one matrices. We think that the conditional tokens are unnecessary to attend targets in advance,
so C2T is set as the all-zero matrix. Therefore, the LA attention mask ˆMLA can be written as

ˆMLA =

(cid:21)

(cid:20)1,

(7)

where MLA indicates the T2T LA mask. To leverage the AR generation and maintain the global information
simultaneously, the target tokens are divided into two groups called the global group and the causal group.
Furthermore, the causal group includes masked targets {tm}(Mq,m = 1) and {tm−1} that need to predict them,
because the labels need to be shifted to the right with one position for the AR learning. Besides, other tokens
are classiﬁed into the global group. Then, the global attention sub-mask Mgs can be attended to all tokens to
share global information and handle the semantic consistency. On the other hand, the causal attention sub-mask
Mcs constitutes the local AR generation. Note that Mgs can not attend any masked tokens to avoid information

leakage. The T2T LA mask can be got with MLA = Mgs + Mcs
Therefore, for the given feature h, the self-attention in iLAT can be written as

SelfAttention(h) = softmax(

QK T
√
d

− (1 − ˆMLA) · ∞)V,

(8)

where Q, K, V are h encoded with diﬀerent weights of d channels. We make all masked elements to −∞ before the
softmax. During the inference, all generated target tokens {ˆtm} are converted back to codebook vectors ˆzq,t. Then,
they are further combined with encoded unmasked features ˆz, and decoded with Eq.(4) as shown in Fig. 2.

To highlight the diﬀerence of our proposed mask MLA, other common attention masks are shown in Fig. 1.
The Vanilla AR mask MAR is widely used in the AR transformer [14, 8], but they fail to maintain the semantic
consistency and cause unexpected identities for the face synthesis. AE mask MAE is utilized in some attention based
image inpainting tasks [50, 49]. Although MAE enjoys good receptive ﬁelds, the masked regions are completely
corrupted in the AE, which is much more unstable to restructure a large hole. Our method is an in-between strategy
with both their superiorities mentioned above.

3.3. Implement Details for Different Tasks

Non-Iconic Posed-Guiding. The proposed TS-VQGAN is also learned with adversarial training. For the
complex non-iconic pose guiding, we ﬁnetune the pretrained open-source ImageNet based VQGAN weights with the
two-stream convolution strategy. To avoid adding too many sequences with excessive computations, we use the
coordinates of 13 target pose landmarks as the supplemental condition to the iLAT. They are encoded with 3 fully
connected layers with ReLU. As shown in Fig. 2, both the condition and the target are images, which have diﬀerent
poses in the training phase, and the same pose in the inference phase. Besides, we use the union of conditional and
target masks got by dilating the poses with diﬀerent kernel sizes according to the scenes2 to the target image.

Face Editing. In face editing, we ﬁnd that the adaptive GAN learning weight λ makes the results unstable,
so it is replaced with a ﬁxed λ = 0.1. Besides, the TS-VQGAN is simpliﬁed compared to the one used in the
pose guiding. Speciﬁcally, all attention layers among the encoder and decoder are removed. Then, all Group

Normalizations are replaced with Instance Normalization to save memory without a large performance drop. The
conditions are composed of the sketch images extracted with the XDoG [46], while the targets are face images. The
training masks for the face editing are COCO masks [24] and simulated irregular masks [51], while the test ones are
drawn manually.

4. Experiments

In this section, we present experimental results on pose-guided generation of Penn Action (PA) [52] and Synthetic
DeepFashion (SDF) [26], face editing of CelebA [27] and FFHQ [20] compared with other competitors and variants
of iLAT.
Datasets. For the pose guiding, PA dataset [52], which contains 2,326 video sequences of 15 action classes in
non-iconic views is used in this section. Each frame from the video is annotated with 13 body landmarks consisted
of 2D locations and visibility. The resolution of PA is resized into 256 × 256 during the preprocessing. We randomly
gather pairs of the same video sequence in the training phase dynamically and select 1,000 testing pairs in the
remaining videos. Besides, the SDF is synthesized with DeepFashion [26] images as foregrounds and Places2 [54]
images as backgrounds. Since only a few images of DeepFashion have related exact segmentation masks, we select
4,500/285 pairs from it for training and testing respectively. Each pair of them contains two images of the same
person with diﬀerent poses and randomly chosen backgrounds. The face editing dataset consists of Flickr-Faces-HQ
dataset (FFHQ) [20] and CelebA-HQ [27]. FFHQ is a high-quality image dataset with 70,000 human faces. We
resize them from 1024 × 1024 into 256 × 256 and use 68,000 of them for the training. The CelebA is only used for
testing in this section for the diversity. Since face editing has no paired ground truth, we randomly select 68 images
from the rest of FFHQ and all CelebA, and draw related sketches for them.
Implementation Details. Our method is implemented in PyTorch in 256 × 256 image size. For the TS-VQGAN
training, we use the Adam optimizer [21] with β1= 0.5 and β2 = 0.9. For the pose guiding, the TS-VQGAN is
ﬁnetuned from the ImageNet pretrained VQGAN [14], while it is completely retrained for FFHQ. TS-VQGAN is
trained with 150k steps without masks at ﬁrst, and then it is trained with another 150k steps with masks in batch
size 16. The initial learning rates of pose guiding and face editing are 8e-5 and 2e-4 respectively, which are decayed
by 0.5 for every 50k steps. For the transformer training, we use Adam with β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.95 with initial
learning rate 5e-5 and 0.01 weight decay. Besides, we warmup the learning rate with the ﬁrst 10k steps, then it is
linearly decayed to 0 for 300k iterations with batch size 16. During the inference, we simply use top-1 sampling for
our iLAT.
Competitors. The model proposed in [14] is abbreviated as Taming transformer (Taming) in this section. For fair
comparisons, VQGAN used in Taming is ﬁnetuned for pose guiding, and retrained for face editing with the same
steps as TS-VQGAN. For the pose guiding, we compare the proposed iLAT with other state-of-the-art methods
retrained in the PA dataset, which include PATN [56], PN-GAN [37], PoseWarp [3], MR-Net [47] and Taming [14].
As the image size of PoseWarp and MR-Net is 128 × 128, we resized the outputs for the comparison. For the face
editing, we compare the iLAT with inpainting based SC-FEGAN [19] and Taming [14]. We also test the Taming
results in our LA attention mask as Taming* (without retraining).

clearly show that our proposed method outperforms other methods in all metrics, especially for the FID, which
accords with the human perception. The good scores of iLAT indicate that the proposed iLAT can generate more
convincing and photo-realistic images on locally guided image synthesis of the non-iconic foreground. For the more
challenging SDF dataset, iLAT still achieves better results compared with Taming.

Inference Time. We also record the average inference times in PA, SDF, and FFHQ as showed in Tab. 2.
Except for the better quality of generated images over Taming as discussed above, our iLAT costs less time for the
local synthesis task according to the masking rate of the inputs. Low masking rates can achieve dramatic speedup,
e.g., face editing.

4.2. Qualitative Results

Non-Iconic Pose Guiding. Fig. 4(A) shows qualitative results in the non-iconic pose-guided image synthesis
task. Compared to other competitors, it is apparent that our method can generate more reasonable target images
both in human bodies and backgrounds, while images generated by other methods suﬀer from either wrong poses or
deformed backgrounds. Particularly, PATN collapses in most cases. PN-GAN and PoseWarp only copy the reference
images as the target ones, which fails to be guided by the given poses due to the challenging PA dataset. Moreover,
MR-Net and Taming* can indeed generate poses that are similar to the target ones, but the background details of
reference images are not transferred properly. Especially for the results in column (g), Taming fails to synthesize
complicated backgrounds, such as noisy audiences in rows 2 and 3 and the gym with various ﬁtness equipment in
row 4. Compared to others, our proposed iLAT can capture the structure of human bodies given the target poses
as well as retaining the vivid backgrounds, which demonstrate the eﬃcacy of our model in synthesizing high-quality
images in the non-iconic pose guiding. Besides, for the pose guiding with synthetic backgrounds of SDF, iLAT can
still get more reasonable and stable backgrounds and foregrounds compared with Taming as in Fig. 5(C).

Face Editing. Since there are no ground truth face editing targets, we only compared the qualitative results as
shown in Fig. 4(B) of FFHQ and CelebA. Note that the Taming results in column (c) fail to preserve the identity

For example, in rows 1, 2 and 3, the skin tones
of Taming results are diﬀerent from the original ones. And in row 4, Taming generates absolutely another person
with contrasting ages, which indicates that vanilla AR is unsuited to the local face editing. When Taming is tested
with our LA attention mask, column (d) shows that Taming* can retain the identities of persons. However, rows 1
and 2 demonstrate that Taming* fails to properly generate the target faces according to guided sketches, while in
rows 3 and 4 some generations have obvious artifacts without consistency. Besides, inpainting-based SC-FEGAN
achieves unstable results in rows 3 and 4. SC-FEGAN also strongly depends on the quality of input sketches,
while unprofessional sketches lead to unnatural results as shown in row 1. Besides, detailed textures of AE-based
SC-FEGAN are unsatisfactory too. Compared with these methods, our iLAT can always generate correct and
vivid human faces with identities retained. Furthermore, beneﬁts from the discrete representation, iLAT enjoys
robustness to the guided information.

iLAT without two-stream convolutions. Please zoom-in for details.

4.3. Further Discussions

Ablation Study. The eﬀectiveness of our proposed two-stream convolution is discussed in the ablation study.
As we can ﬁnd in Fig. 5, the woman face in row 1, (c) generated by iLAT* has residual face parts that conﬂict with
the guided sketch. Moreover, in row 2, iLAT* without two-stream convolutions leaks information from sunglasses
that lacks correct semantic features and leads to the inconsistent color of the generated face. For the pose-guided
instance shown in the second row, it is apparent that the man generated in column (c) has blurry leg positions.
However, in column (d) the complete iLAT can always generate authentic and accurate images, validating the
eﬃcacy of our designed two-stream convolutions.

Sequential Generation. Our iLAT can also be extended to guide the video generation properly. We give a
qualitative example in this section. As shown in Fig. 6, given a sequence of poses and one reference image, iLAT can
forecast a plausible motion of the person. And the results are robust for most kinds of activities in non-ironic views.

5. Conclusion

This paper proposes a transformer based AR model called iLAT to solve local image generation tasks. This method
leverages a novel LA attention mask to enlarge the receptive ﬁelds of AR, which achieves not only semantically
consistent but also realistic generative results and accelerates the inference speed of AR. Besides, a TS-VQGAN is
proposed to learn a discrete representation learning without information leakages. Such a model can get superior
performance in detail editing. Extensive experiments validate the eﬃcacy of our iLAT for local image generation.

Social Impacts

This paper exploited the image editing with transformers. Since face editing may causes some privacy issues, we
sincerely remind users to pay attention for it. Our method only focuses on technical aspects. The images used in
this paper are all open sourced.

A.1. Network Architectures

TS-VQGAN. The architecture of TS-VQGAN used in pose guiding (Penn [52] and synthesis DeepFashion [26])
is follow the VQGAN [14] with its ImageNet pretrained weights. The TS-VQGAN for face datasets (FFHQ [20]) is
simpliﬁed as in Tab. 3. The channels of codebook are 256. For the pose guiding and face editing, we set the total
codebook number as 16384 and 2048 respectively.

Transformer. We use the transformer with a ‘base’ scale [11] of channels 768, attention head numbers 12,

transformer layers 12, which is trained with dropout rate 0.1.

A.2. Supplementary Experiment Details

Masks for the Penn Action Dataset Since the Penn Action (PA) [52] dataset includes various scenes videos,
many handheld objects inﬂuence the generated results, e.g., baseball bats, golf clubs, and barbells, etc. We get the
related masks with various dilated rates according to the image scenes as shown in Fig. 7.
Synthesis for the DeepFashion and Places2 The synthesis DeepFashion [26] (SDF) is composed of DeepFashion
and Places2 [54] as foregrounds and backgrounds respectively. We show the combined results in Fig. 8.

A.3. More Experiment Results

Human Evaluation. For more comprehensive comparisons, 68 images selected from FFHQ and CelebA are
compared by 3 uncorrelated volunteers. Particularly, volunteers need to choose the best one from randomly shuﬄed
4 compared methods, which include Taming [14], Taming* (Taming with LA mask), SC-FEGAN [19], and our iLAT.
Outputs of all these methods are combined with the references. Then, they give one score to the best approach. If
all methods work roughly the same for a certain sample, it will be ignored for the ﬁnal decision. The average scores
are shown in Tab. 4.
Combining Outputs and References. Although our proposed iLAT can maintain the global semantics in most
cases, it still suﬀers from few unexpected changes in some details, e.g., facial features (Fig. 9 rows 1 and 3 (c)),
words in backgrounds (Fig. 9 row 2 (c)), and hats (Fig. 9 row 4 (c)) as shown in Fig. 9. This problem is similar
to the one in most GAN inverse based methods [1, 40]. To this end, these methods combine their outputs with
original images, and achieve the ﬁnal results. We also show the combination of our method in face dataset in Fig. 9.
We simply resize the input masks to 128×128, and resize them back to 256×256 for the smoothness. Note that
combinations of Taming and references have obvious boundaries caused by the inconsistent semantics (Fig. 9 (d)),

15

Figure 9: Comparisons of face dataset, where images in (d) are combinations of Taming and references, and images
in (e) are combinations of iLAT and references. Please zoom-in for details.

while our iLAT outputs can be seamlessly combined with the references, and achieve much better performance.
More Qualitative Results. We show more related qualitative experiment results in face dataset (Fig. 10), PA
(Fig. 11), SDF (Fig. 12), and sequential generations of pose guiding (Fig. 13).

A.4. Alternative Version of the Attention Mask

As discussed in the main paper, the proposed local autoregressive (LA) attention mask MLA enjoys both global

semantic information and local AR generation.

In contrast, we also consider another possible version for attention mask as illustrated in Fig. 14: For the tokens
that are not needed to predict any other tokens, such as {t[s], t2, t3, t5, t7, t8}, their respective ﬁelds can be further
shifted to right until the masked tokens, as the red points shown in Fig. 14. However, technically it is very hard to
implement this version processed in parallel; and thus it is impossible to eﬃciently utilize this version in our iLAT.
We will make it as the future work of extending this alternative of attention mask.
