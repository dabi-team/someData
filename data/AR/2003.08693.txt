ABSTRACT
We present the analysis of two outﬂows (S1 at –5500 km s−1 and S2 at –9700 km s−1) seen in
recent HST/COS observations of quasar SDSS J0755+2306 (z = 0.854). The outﬂows are detected as
absorption troughs from both high-ionization species, including N iii, O iii, and S iv, and very high-
ionization species, including Ar viii, Ne viii, and Na ix. The derived photoionization solutions show
that each outﬂow requires a two ionization-phase solution. For S1, troughs from S iv* and S iv allow
us to derive an electron number density, ne = 1.8×104 cm−3, and its distance from the central source
of R = 270 pc. For S2, troughs from O iii* and O iii yield ne = 1.2×103 cm−3 and R = 1600 pc.
The kinetic luminosity of S2 is > 12% of the Eddington luminosity for the quasar and therefore can
provide strong AGN feedback eﬀects. Comparison of absorption troughs from O iii and O vi in both
outﬂow systems supports the idea that for a given element, higher ionization ions have larger covering
fractions than lower ionization ones.

INTRODUCTION
Broad absorption line (BAL) outﬂows are detected as
blueshifted absorption troughs in 15 – 25 % of quasar
spectra (Tolea et al. 2002; Hewett & Foltz 2003; Reichard
et al. 2003; Trump et al. 2006; Ganguly & Brotherton
2008; Gibson et al. 2009, and references therein). These
outﬂows provide an important mechanism to carry en-
ergy, mass, and momentum out of the quasar’s central
regions (e.g., Scannapieco & Oh 2004; Ciotti, Ostriker &
Proga 2009; Ostriker et al. 2010; Hopkins & Elvis 2010;
Choi et al. 2014; Hopkins et al. 2016). Theoretical stud-
ies and simulations show that these outﬂows are related
to a variety of AGN feedback processes (see elaboration
in section 1 of Arav et al. 2019, hereafter, Paper I). To
quantify the extent that outﬂows can contribute to AGN
feedback, we need to determine their kinetic luminosity
( ˙Ek). Theoretical models predict that ˙Ek needs to be at
least 0.5 % (Hopkins & Elvis 2010) or 5 % (Scannapieco
& Oh 2004) of the Eddington luminosity (Ledd) in order
to provide strong AGN feedback.

In this paper, we analyze two outﬂows emanating from
quasar SDSS J0755+2306. The data is from a spectro-
scopic survey of ten quasars in the 500 – 1050 ˚A Extreme-
UV (EUV500) band (see Paper I). These two outﬂows
present features diﬀerent from other quasar outﬂows ob-
served in the EUV500: 1) deep absorption troughs from
doubly ionized species, e.g., C iii λ977.02 ˚A, the N iii
multiplets near 686 ˚A, 764 ˚A, and 990 ˚A, and the O iii
multiplets near 703 ˚A and 834 ˚A; 2) continuous blended
absorption that depress the ﬂux in the 1227 ˚A < λ <
1290 ˚A and 1340 ˚A < λ < 1440 ˚A observed frame re-
gions.

This paper is part of a series of publications describing

† Email: xinfeng@vt.edu

the results of HST program GO-14777, which observed
quasar outﬂows in the EUV500 using the Cosmic Origin
Spectrograph (COS).
Paper I (Arav et al. 2020) summarizes the results for
the individual objects and discusses their importance to
various aspects of quasar outﬂow research.
Paper II (Xu et al. 2020a) gives the full analysis for 4
outﬂows detected in SDSS J1042+1646, including the
largest kinetic luminosity ( ˙Ek = 1047 erg s−1) outﬂow
measured to date at R = 800 pc, and an outﬂow at
R = 15 pc.
Paper III (Miller et al. 2020a) analyzes 4 outﬂows
detected in 2MASS J1051+1247, which show remarkable
similarities, are situated at R ∼ 200 pc and have a
combined ˙Ek = 1046 erg s−1.
Paper IV (Xu et al. 2020b) presents the largest velocity
shift and acceleration measured to date in a BAL
outﬂow.
Paper V (Miller et al. 2020b) analyzes 2 outﬂows
detected in PKS 0352-0711, one outﬂow at R = 500 pc
and a second outﬂow at R = 10 pc that shows an
ionization-potential-dependent velocity shift for troughs
from diﬀerent ions.
Paper VI is this work.
Paper VII (Miller et al. 2020c) discusses the other
objects observed by program GO-14777, whose outﬂow
characteristics make the analysis more challenging.

The structure of this paper is as follows. We present
the observations and data reduction in section 2. In sec-
tion 3, we present the analysis of the spectrum for the
two outﬂow systems. We determine each outﬂow’ elec-
tron number density (ne) and distance in section 4 and
constrain their energetics in section 5. We discuss the
results and compare with other EUV500 outﬂows in sec-

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
SDSS J0755+2306 (J2000: R.A. = 07:55:14.58, decl.
= +23:06:07.13, z = 0.854) was observed by HST/COS
(Green et al. 2012) using gratings G130M and G160M
in September of 2017 as part of our HST/COS program
GO-14777 (PI: Arav). This object was observed previ-
ously in December of 2010 using the HST/COS G140L
grating in the program GO-12289 (PI: J. Howk). The
details of these observations are shown in table 1. We
reduce and process the data and errors in the same way
as described in Miller et al. (2018). We corrected for
Galactic extinction with E(B-V) = 0.045 (Schlaﬂy &
Finkbeiner 2011). For the 2017 observations, we com-
bined the two observations for each grating to increase
the signal to noise. We show the full, dereddened spec-
trum in ﬁgure 1. For regions outside the wavelength
range of the 2017 epoch data, we show the 2010 epoch
data.

Two outﬂow systems are identiﬁed: S1 has a veloc-
ity centroid (vc) at –5520 km s−1 (based on its S iv
λ809.66 trough) and S2 at –9660 km s−1 (based on its
S vi λ933.38 trough).
In ﬁgure 1, absorption troughs
associated with S1 and S2 are shaded in red and blue,
respectively. Blended regions of the two outﬂow systems
are shaded green. The unabsorbed emission model is
comprised of a power law continuum and strong emis-
sion lines ﬁtted with Gaussian proﬁles (Chamberlain et
al. 2015; Miller et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018). The Galactic
damped Lyα absorption is modeled with a Voigt proﬁle
(log(NH) = 20.4+0.15
−0.15 cm−2, e.g., Prochaska et al. 2005).
The ﬁnal, adopted emission model is shown as the solid
red line in ﬁgure 1.

3. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
3.1. Column Density Determinations
The ionic column densities (Nion) measured from the
spectra represent the ionization structure of the observed
outﬂow material. Like in all 11 outﬂows in the other
objects (see table 1 of Paper I), we observe in S1 and
S2 strong absorption troughs from very high-ionization
species, including Ar viii, Ne viii, Na ix, and Mg x. Sim-
ilar to 10 of the outﬂows in the other objects (the ex-
ception is S4 of SDSS J1042+1646, see Paper IV), we
observe in S1 and S2 absorption troughs from triply ion-
ized species, e.g., N iv, O iv, and S iv. We also observe

3.1). In the photoionization models, we investigated several pos-
sible scenarios (section 3.2).

absorption troughs from doubly ionized species in S1 and
S2, including C iii, N iii, and O iii. The only other out-
ﬂow analyzed in our EUV500 program that shows such
troughs is the –3150 km s−1 outﬂow system in Paper V.
Overall, we observe troughs in quasar SDSS J0755+2306
from ions with a larger spread of ionization potentials
(48 eV ∼ 367 eV) than in most of the other analyzed
outﬂows in our EUV500 program. The atomic data for
these transitions are shown in table 3 of Paper II.

Following the methodology in section 3 of Paper II,
we analyze the data and measure Nion as follows. Most
measured Nion use the apparent optical depth (AOD)
method. Visual inspection of the troughs between epochs
show no signiﬁcant variability. Therefore, when possible,
we use the Nion measurements from the 2017 epoch data
since it has higher signal-to-noise and spectral resolu-
tion. Most of the measured troughs are treated as lower
limits since their levels of non-black saturation are un-

The unabsorbed emission model and the ﬂux error are shown as the red and gray solid lines, respectively. We shade the signiﬁcant ionic
absorption troughs for the two outﬂow systems, S1 and S2, of the 2017 epoch in red and blue, respectively. Blended regions of the two
outﬂow systems are shaded green. Strong Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) lines (e.g., C ii λ1334.53 and C ii* λ1335.71) and geocoronal
lines (e.g., H i at 1215.67 ˚A, O i at 1302.17 ˚A, and O i* at 1304.86 ˚A, 1306.03 ˚A) are marked with black dotted lines. The Galactic damped
Lyα (at 1215.67 ˚A rest frame) is modeled by a Voigt proﬁle with log(NH) = 20.4 cm−2. The 2010 data are the blue histograms in the ﬁrst
panel. This covers an extra wavelength range from 1080 – 1135 ˚A. The 2010 data are consistent with the 2017 data in the overlapping
regions.

known without available partial covering (PC) solutions
(Borguet et al. 2012b). For absorption trough regions
with a maximum optical depth, τmax < 0.05, we consider
their AOD Nion as upper limits. In section 4, we show
that we can obtain Nion measurements for S iv and S iv*
for S1. We show the measured Nion in the third column
of table 2 and the corresponding ion and wavelength in
the ﬁrst two columns. All troughs in ﬁgure 1 that are not
listed in table 2 are severely blended, yielding unreliable
Nion measurements or limits.

For the transitions of Mg x λ624.94 and Ca vii λ624.38,
their absorption troughs are too close to be disentan-
gled (S1 around 1135 ˚A and S2 around 1120 ˚A, observed-
frame). In table 2, we report the Nion values for Mg x or
Ca vii assuming that the whole blended trough is from
Mg x or Ca vii, respectively. When determining the pho-
toionization solutions, we investigate several possible sce-
narios for the blending between Mg x and Ca vii (see sec-
tion 3.2).

For the Nion of H i

in S2, the ionic transition of
H i λ972.54 does not show consistently deep absorption
trough features near 1745 ˚A observed-frame. Therefore,
we measure the AOD Nion from the trough of H i λ972.54
and treat it as an upper limit for H i. The ionic transi-
tion of H i λ1025.72 exhibits deep absorption near 1840 –
1845 ˚A observed-frame, while the right wing is blended
with O vi λ1031.91. We assume the trough from H i
λ1025.72 is symmetric and double its blue half AOD
value for the lower limit Nion of H i. Therefore, the Nion
of H i for outﬂow S1 is constrained to the range of 15.68
to 16.15 [in units of log(cm−2)].

3.2. Photoionization Analysis
We assume the spectral energy distribution HE0238
SED (Arav et al. 2013). This SED is physically plausi-
ble since it is based on observations of quasar HE 0238–
1904 in the EUV500 band (Arav et al. 2013). Two main
parameters govern the photoionization structure of each
outﬂow: the total hydrogen column density (NH) and
the ionization parameter (UH):

UH ≡

QH
4πR2nHc

(1)

where R is the distance from the central source to the ab-
sorber, nH is the hydrogen number density, c is the speed
of light, and QH = 3.1 × 1056 s−1 is the emission rate of
hydrogen-ionizing photons (obtained by integrating the
HE0238 SED for energies above 1 Ryd). The correspond-
ing bolometric luminosity is ∼ 4.4 × 1046 erg s−1.

We start with assuming solar metallicity and compare
the measured Nion (table 2) to the model predicted Nion
from the spectra synthesis code Cloudy [version c17.00,
Ferland et al. (2017)] (top panel of ﬁgure 2). The colored
contours for individual ions show where the measured
Nion are consistent (≤ 1σ) with the modelled Nion from
Cloudy (Borguet et al. 2012a). The colored contours
with solid lines are Nion measurements, and dotted or
dashed lines are Nion upper or lower limits, respectively.
It is evident that there is no viable solution for solar
metallicity. Any solution that matches the upper limit
Nion of H i will simultaneously underpredict Nion of N iii,
S iv, and S vi by up to a factor of 5.

Figure 2. The best ﬁtting photoionization solutions for outﬂows
S1 and S2. Top: Comparison of the Cloudy modeled Nion to
the measured Nion in S1 assuming solar metallicity. Each colored
contour represents the region where the (NH, UH) model produces
consistent Nion within the errors with the observed values. Solid
lines represent Nion measurements while dotted and dashed lines
represent upper and lower Nion limits, respectively. Any solution
that matches the upper limit Nion of H i underpredicts Nion of
N iii, S iv, and S vi by up to a factor of 5. Middle and Bottom:
Under super-solar metallicity, the Nion from S1 and S2 match with
two-phase photoionization solutions (see section 3.2). The very
high- and high-ionization phase solutions are the blue and red “×”
along with their 1σ error contours (the black ellipses), respectively.
The black, blue, and red ellipses are accounting for the blending
of troughs from Mg x λ624.94 and Ca vii λ624.38 (see section 3.2).
The other Nion lower and upper limits which are not shown here
are consistent with the solutions and omitted for clarity’s sake.

One possible solution is to invoke a super-solar metal-
licity. There were outﬂow systems which have been found
to have super-solar metallicity (e.g., Gabel et al. 2006;
Arav et al. 2007, 2019). In the middle and bottom panel
of ﬁgure 2, we present the photoionization solutions as-
suming the HE0238 SED and the super-solar metallicity
described in Paper V (Z = 4.68 Z(cid:12)). As in most of the
other EUV500 outﬂows in our HST program GO-14777
(see table 1 of Paper I, except S4 in SDSS J1042+1646),
we invoke a two-phase photoionization solution for both
S1 and S2 (Arav et al. 2013). The very high-ionization
phase (VHP) and high-ionization phase (HP) solutions
are the blue and red “×” along with their 1σ error con-
tours (the black ellipses), respectively. The ratios of the
measured Nion to the model predicted Nion are given in
the fourth column of table 2. When Nion,mea is a lower
limit, we expect to have Nion,mea/Nion,model < 1 and vice
versa.

Due to the blending absorption troughs from Mg x
λ624.94 and Ca vii λ624.38 (S1 around 1135 ˚A and S2
around 1120 ˚A observed-frame, see ﬁgure 1), we present
the photoionization solutions considering three diﬀerent
blending scenarios (ﬁgure 2). 1) half the trough’s optical
depth is from the Ca viii ionic transition and the other
half is from the Mg x ionic transition black ellipses), 2)
the trough is comprised of only the ionic transition of
Ca vii λ624.38 (blue ellipses), and 3) the trough is con-
tributed from only the ionic transition of Mg x λ624.94
(red ellipses). For both S1 and S2, the blue “×” denotes
the photoionization solution with the least NH for the
very high-ionization phase.

other unknown parameter is nH, and in a highly ionized
plasma, nH ≈ 0.8ne. Here we use the density sensitive
Nion ratio from S iv*/S iv (for S1) and O iii*/O iii (for
S2) to constrain ne.

4.1. Determination of ne for S1 from S iv*/S iv
For S1, we observe absorption at the expected wave-
length locations of the S iv lines listed in table 3. How-
ever, the 744.90 ˚A, 748.39 ˚A, 750.22 ˚A, and 753.76 ˚A
troughs are severely blended with absorption troughs
from S2 (see ﬁgure 1). Therefore, the Nion from these
S iv transitions can not be reliably determined. The
657.32 ˚A, 661.40 ˚A, 809.66 ˚A, and 815.94 ˚A troughs are
not blended with other troughs from S2 or strong inter-
vening systems (see ﬁgure 3). We show the comparison
of these troughs in velocity space in ﬁgure 3.

The velocity centroids match well for these troughs as
indicated by the green solid lines, while the Nion inte-
gration ranges are the green dotted lines. The 815.94 ˚A
trough clearly has less Nion than the 809.66 ˚A trough,
which is consistent with our derived N(S iv*)/N(S iv) ra-
tio. For the AOD method, the expected optical depth (τ )
ratio of the 657.32 ˚A trough to the 809.66 ˚A trough is:

S iv, we derived [τ (v)661.40/τ (v)815.94]AOD = 9.7 and
[τ (v)661.40/τ (v)815.94]obs (cid:39) 3. Therefore, the 661.40 ˚A
trough is also non-black saturated. Thus, we use the PC
method to obtain the Nion for the S iv resonance state
(Elow = 0 cm−1) from the 657.32 ˚A and 809.66 ˚A troughs
and the excited state from the 661.40 ˚A and 815.94 ˚A
troughs. The resulting ratio of the S iv* column density

for S1. The data are shown as the black histogram. The vertical,
green solid line shows the velocity centroid of S1, while the Nion
integration range are shown as the dashed green lines (see section
4).

4. ELECTRON NUMBER DENSITY AND DISTANCES
By assuming the outﬂow is governed by photoioniza-
tion, we can solve for R from equation (1). The only

to the S iv column density,
0.54+0.20
−0.17.

In ﬁgure 4, we compare this S iv column density ratio
to those predicted by the CHIANTI database (version
7.1.3, Landi et al. 2013). The mean temperature for S iv
is 8700 K, which is based on the photoionization solution
for the HP of S1 (section 3.2). The red curve is the
model predictions from CHIANTI while the red cross is
the derived N(S iv*)/N(S iv) ratio with its uncertainties.
We ﬁnd log(ne) = 4.26+0.21
−0.20 (hereafter, ne is in units of
log(cm−3)).

Figure 5. Fits to the O iii+O iii* multiplet region for outﬂow
S2. To get the best ﬁt, we vary ne (in units of cm−3) and probe
the photoionization solution inside the 1σ error contour of the HP
in S2. The ne and the corresponding temperature predicted from
Cloudy are shown at the bottom-left corner of each panel. The
black and gray solid histograms are the normalized ﬂux and errors
from the HST/COS observations in 2017. For each subplot, the red
dashed lines represent the models of the O iii+O iii* multiplet for a
particular log(ne), while the solid black lines are the summation of
all models in this region. See section 4.2 for a detailed discussion.

1490 – 1510 ˚A observed-frame region (see ﬁgure 5). We
then do a χ2-minimization of the data and model for the
O iii+O iii* region. The red dashed lines represent the
modeled troughs of the O iii+O iii* multiplet for a par-
ticular ne, while the solid black lines are the summation
of all models in the region.

Since a single-Gaussian optical depth proﬁle (e.g.,
equation (2) of Paper II) does not ﬁt the O iii+O iii*
region well, we adopt a two-Gaussian optical depth pro-
ﬁle following Borguet et al. (2012b). The two Gaussians
have the same velocity width (σ) of 350 km s−1. The
main Gaussian contains 65% of the total Nion and has
a velocity centroid (vc) of –9660 km s−1, while the sec-
ondary Gaussian contains 35% of the total Nion with vc
= –8860 km s−1. The same two-Gaussian proﬁle also ﬁts
well the lower-velocity wing of other outﬂow troughs in
S2, e.g., from Ar viii λ713.80.

Adopting the two-Gaussian proﬁle, the best-ﬁtting
log(ne) = 3.1, where the corresponding models are shown
in the panel 2 of ﬁgure 5. The models with log(ne) = 2.6
and log(ne) = 3.9 deviate from the best-ﬁtting model by
1σ (see panel 1 and 3 of ﬁgure 5), where they clearly un-
derestimate the absorption troughs from 1500 – 1510 ˚A
and 1493 – 1498 ˚A observed-frame, respectively. Overall,
we get log(ne) = 3.1+0.8
−0.5.

By adopting the best-ﬁtting ne value and errors into

equation (1), we obtain R = 1600+2000

−1100 pc.

5. OUTFLOW ENERGETICS
By assuming each outﬂow is in the form of a thin shell,
covering a solid angle of 4πΩ around the source, moving
with a radial velocity v at a distance R from the central

Figure 4. Column density ratio of S iv* to S iv vs. electron num-
ber density, ne, for outﬂow S1. The red cross marks the ratio with
the uncertainties derived in section 4. The colored curves are the
predictions from the CHIANTI database (version 7.1.3, Landi et
al. 2013) assuming diﬀerent temperature. The mean temperature
of the S iv gas based on the photoionization solution for the HP of
S1 is 8700 K (section 3.2).

For outﬂow S1, we also observe absorption troughs
from other density sensitive transitions, e.g., O iv
λ787.71 and O iv* λ790.20 and O iii+O iii* near 833 ˚A
in the observed frame (see ﬁgure 1). Unfortunately, their
absorption troughs are either saturated or too blended to
provide useful ne constraints. However, their absorption
troughs are consistent with our best ﬁtting photoion-
ization model. Therefore, by adopting the best-ﬁt UH
and S iv-determined ne into equation (1), we obtain R =
270+100

−90 pc.

4.2. Determination of ne for S2 from O iii*/O iii
For outﬂow S2, the stronger S iv and S iv* transi-
tions at 657.32 ˚A and 661.40 ˚A do not show distinctive
troughs. However, we detect deep absorption features
at the expected wavelength location of the O iii+O iii*
multiplet (O iii λ832.93, and O iii* λλ833.75, 835.29). To
determine ne, we adopt the same analysis method from
Paper II.

To ﬁt the observed absorption features, we start with
the photoionization solution inside the 1σ contour of the
HP for S2 (the contour surrounding the red × in the bot-
tom panel of ﬁgure 2). We vary log(ne) from 2 to 8 and
overlay the model predicted O iii+O iii* troughs to the

where NH is the total hydrogen column density, mp is

Using R with the UH and NH from the best-ﬁtting pho-
toionization solutions, we present the derived ˙M and ˙Ek
values in table 4, where we assume Ω = 0.2 (see section
6.4 of Paper II).

Using SDSS data, we measure the full-width-half-
maximum of the Mg ii broad emission line and estimate
the Eddington luminosity (Ledd) with the Mg ii–based
black hole mass equation in Bahk et al. (2019). This
leads to Ledd = 1.0 × 1047 erg s−1. Therefore, outﬂows
S1 and S2 yield the ratio of kinetic luminosity to Ledd
of > 0.2% and 12 – 250%, respectively. The large range
for S2 is due to the uncertainties of its NH and ne, while
the conservative lower limit of 12% is assured. Outﬂow
S2, with ˙Ek greater than 5% of Ledd, is a good candidate
for producing strong AGN feedback (Scannapieco & Oh
2004).

6. DISCUSSION
6.1. Partial Covering and Ionization State Relationship
Outﬂows are found to only partially cover the emis-
sion source (e.g., Korista et al. 1992; Arav et al. 1999b,
2001, 2012; Hamann et al. 2001), and evidence exists to

support the idea that the covering factor (fcov) becomes
larger when the level of ionization within the outﬂow in-
creases. For example, Korista et al. (1992) reported that
the quasar 0226–1024 has an outﬂow with troughs from
multiple doublet transitions arising from ions with diﬀer-
ent ionization potentials (IP). From the atomic data in
Allen (1977), IP(O vi) = 77.41 eV > IP(C iv) = 64.49 eV
> IP(Si iv) = 45.14 eV, and Korista et al. (1992) found
that the depths of the saturated absorption troughs from
these doublets follow the same trend. Possible explana-
tions include that the outﬂows have small dense cores
covered by loose envelopes. Therefore, the low-density
envelopes with larger fcov would tend to have higher-
ionization levels than the high-density cores. However,
elemental abundances are also found to aﬀect the fcov
(Telfer et al. 1998; Arav et al. 1999a). Studying diﬀerent
ionization states from the same element eliminates the
abundance eﬀects and provide us with a direct test of
the relationship between fcov and ionization states.

Outﬂow S2 shows absorption troughs from two diﬀer-
ent ions of oxygen: the O iii (IP = 55.9 eV) multiplet
around 834 ˚A and the O vi (IP = 138.1 eV) doublet
at 1031.93 ˚A and 1037.62 ˚A (see ﬁgure 1). From our
photoionization solutions, the VHP produces a negligi-
ble amount of the Nion for O iii (< 0.1%) and almost ten
times more Nion for O vi than the HP. Therefore, O iii
and O vi are good candidates for testing the diﬀerence
in fcov between the phases. Our best ﬁtting photoion-
ization models predict that the absorption troughs from
both of them are saturated, with Nmodel/Nmea ∼ 5 and
30 for O iii and O vi, respectively (see table 2). How-
ever, the O iii doublet shows non-black saturation with
residual ﬂux ∼ 30 – 50%, while the O vi doublet has near
zero residual ﬂux (see ﬁgure 1). This directly supports
the idea that for the same element, higher-ionization ions
indeed cover a larger area of the emission source.

The O iii and O vi troughs in S1 show a similar be-
havior and support the same idea, as the saturated O iii
multiplet in S1 shows residual ﬂux ∼ 10% and the satu-
rated O vi doublet has nearly zero residual ﬂux.

6.2. The λ > 1050 ˚A Portion of the Outﬂow Spectra
Ground-based BAL quasar outﬂow (BALQSO) stud-
ies mainly cover the rest frame wavelength range of λ
> 1050 ˚A, which usually show absorption troughs from
only H i, N v, Si iv, and C iv. The widest trough with a
measurable width for S1 is the O iii multiplet near 820 ˚A
(rest frame) with ∆v = 2500 km s−1 (measured for con-
tinuous absorption below the normalized ﬂux I = 0.9).
For S2, we measure a width of 3100 km s−1 from the S vi
933.38 ˚A trough. Therefore, both of these outﬂows are
identiﬁed as broad absorption line outﬂows (BALs, see
section 6.3 of Paper II for elaboration).

From the best ﬁtting photoionization solution derived
in section 3.2, we can predict the absorption features
for the λ > 1050 ˚A rest frame region for each outﬂow
by assuming this region has the same absorption trough
In ﬁgure 6, we show
shape as in the EUV500 region.
the predicted troughs. For outﬂows S1 and S2, the pre-
dicted C iv λλ1548.19, 1550.77 absorption troughs are
saturated, blended, and have widths of 2400 km s−1 and
2600 km s−1, respectively. Therefore, they are predicted
to be BALs following the criteria of Weymann et al.

(1991).

The models also predict weak absorption troughs for
both S iv λ1062.66 and S iv* λ1072.97 with oscillator
strengths (f ) for both about 0.05, which are the main
density sensitive transitions for the λ > 1050 ˚A rest
frame region (Arav et al. 2018). However, the pre-
dicted troughs have maximum optical depths around
0.05, which make their detection unlikely with ground-
based telescopes for a couple of reasons. First, τ = 0.05
troughs are diﬃcult to detect in principle due to their
shallowness and systematic issues regarding the unab-
sorbed emission model. Second and more important,
from the ground we can detect the 1062 ˚A rest-frame
wavelength region only for quasars with redshifts z (cid:38) 2.5.
At these redshifts, the Lyα forest severely contaminates
the S iv troughs, which makes the task of identifying such
shallow trough hopeless in SDSS data and very diﬃcult
in Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-shooter observations
(the latter observations have both higher S/N and spec-
tral resolution than the SDSS data, see Arav et al. 2018;
Xu et al. 2018, 2019).

In contrast, for the same outﬂow, we have four de-
tected pairs of S iv and S iv* troughs in the EUV500
with associated f values up to 20 times larger (result-
ing in deeper troughs for the same amount of S iv Nion).
Also the availability of two uncontaminated pairs of S iv
and S iv* troughs in S1, with large f value diﬀerences,
makes the ne determination more robust and less aﬀected
by possible systematic issues. Based on these S iv and
S iv* EUV500 troughs, we were able to determine the ne,
R, and energetics for outﬂow S1 (see section 4).

We also note that the predicted P v troughs are even
shallower than the S iv λ1062.66 and S iv* λ1072.97 ones,
which explains the low detection rate of P v troughs
among BAL quasars (3.0 – 6.2%, see Capellupo et al.

2017).

7. SUMMARY
In this paper, we analyzed outﬂows seen in the recent
HST/COS spectra of quasar SDSS J0755+2306. The
main results are summarized as follows:

1. Two outﬂow systems are identiﬁed. They present
clear absorption troughs
from both high-ionization
species, e.g., N iii, O iii, O iv and S iv, and very high-
ionization species, e.g., Ar viii, Ne viii, and Na ix (see
section 2). Both outﬂows are classiﬁed as BALs from
their widest EUV500 absorption trough widths.

2. Similar to the outﬂow analysis in Papers II, III, and
V, each outﬂow system requires a two ionization-phase
solution (see section 3.2).

3. For outﬂow system 2, we derive log(ne) = 3.1 based
on the density sensitive transitions of O iii and O iii*
in the EUV500 band. The determined distance of this
outﬂow is 1600 pc and the kinetic luminosity is >12% of
Ledd (see section 4 and 5). Therefore, this outﬂow is a
good candidate for producing strong AGN feedback.

4. The absorption troughs from O iii and O vi support
the idea that high-ionization ions have a larger covering
fraction compared to lower-ionization ions (see section
6.1).
