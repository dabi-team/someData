A new α-emitting isotope 214U, produced by fusion-evaporation reaction 182W(36Ar, 4n)214U,
was identiﬁed by employing the gas-ﬁlled recoil separator SHANS and recoil-α correlation technique.
More precise α-decay properties of even-even nuclei 216,218U were also measured in reactions of 40Ar,
40Ca with 180,182,184W targets. By combining the experimental data, improved α-decay reduced
widths δ2 for the even-even Po–Pu nuclei in the vicinity of magic neutron number N = 126 were
deduced. Their systematic trends are discussed in terms of NpNn scheme in order to study the
inﬂuence of proton-neutron interaction on α decay in this region of nuclei. It is strikingly found
that the reduced widths of 214,216U are signiﬁcantly enhanced by a factor of two as compared
with the NpNn systematics for the 84 ≤ Z ≤ 90 and N < 126 even-even nuclei. The abnormal
enhancement is interpreted by the strong monopole interaction between the valence protons and
neutrons occupying the π1f7/2 and ν1f5/2 spin-orbit partner orbits, which is supported by a large-
scale shell model calculation.

Nucleon-nucleon interaction, which governs the exis-
tence of nuclear system, plays a fundamental role in
understanding of the properties of exotic nuclei far from
stability. Although the proton-proton (p-p) and neutron-
neutron (n-n) correlations are well-known to be crucial
for explaining a wealth of experimental data, the proton-
neutron (p-n) interaction has long been recognized as
one of the essential driving forces for the shell structure
evolution, the development of collectivity and the onset
In the last
of deformation in atomic nuclei
decades, thanks to the development of radioactive beam
facilities worldwide, enormous progress in the physics
of change of nuclear shell structure as a function of
proton and/or neutron numbers has been achieved in
light nuclei. However, the experimental knowledge for
the structure evolution in heavy nuclei around and below
the neutron closed shell at N = 126 remains scarce at

present [3, 11–15].

It is well known that, because of large overlap of
the radial wave functions, the attractive and short-
range interaction between valence protons and neutrons
occupying orbits with the same number of nodes and
orbital angular momenta (i.e., ∆n = ∆l = 0) becomes
stronger than those in other categories, and eventually
triggers the remarkable changes of closed shells (see [3, 4],
and references therein). For instance, the π0f7/2–ν0f5/2
interaction was shown to play an important role for
structure evolution of N = 34 isotones of Ca, Ti, Cr, and
Fe, culminating in the creation of new magic numbers
at N = 32, 34 in 52,54Ca (see Fig. 1 from Ref. [16] and
Ref. [17]). In the trans-lead nuclear region with Z > 82
and N ≤ 126, the valence protons ﬁll the 0h9/2, 1f7/2,
and 0i13/2 orbits, while the neutrons mainly occupy the
2p1/2, 1f5/2, and 2p3/2 orbits [18, 19]. Therefore, one can

ERs and/or their descendants were registered with an
eﬃciency of ∼54%. Eight side silicon detectors (SSDs)
were mounted in front of the PSSDs in an open box
geometry to measure the escaped α particles. For such
events, the total α-particle energy was reconstructed by
adding the deposited energies in PSSD and SSD. In order
to distinguish the α-decay events from the implanted
products, two multi-wire proportional counters were
installed upstream from the PSSDs. A digital data
readout system including waveform digitizers was used
for the data acquisition. Details of the detection system
and data analysis method were described in Refs. [14, 15,
40, 41].

The identiﬁcation of 214U was performed by searching
for the position-time correlated α-decay chains with the
help of known α-decay properties of its descendants.
An energy spectrum for α-decay events following the
ERs and a two-dimensional plot for the decay energy
correlation between mother and daughter nuclei (ER −
αm − αd) are shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.
The Pa, Th, and Ac isotopes were produced from
charged-particle evaporation channels. Two decay events

α-decay spectroscopy has been proven to be a powerful
tool to probe the nuclear structure in heavy nuclei [20–
23]. There are analytical
formulae to calculate the
α-decay half-lives such as the new Geiger-Nuttall law
[24, 25]. Typically, the α-decay process is described by
the two-step mechanism, involving the preformation of
α particle followed by its penetration through Coulomb
and centrifugal barriers. The α-particle preformation
probability involves all the nuclear structure information,
and can be weighed experimentally by α-decay reduced

probability |RFα(R)|2 [27, 28]. It is interesting to note
that the α-decay reduced widths of several Z ∼ N
nuclei around 100Sn (Z = N = 50) are enhanced
by at least a factor of two relative to the benchmark
nucleus 212
84 Po128 and its neighbouring Po isotopes [29–
32]. This enhancement was explained by the so-called
“superallowed α decay” [20, 33]
in relation to the
fact that the valence protons and neutrons are in the
same single-particle levels, giving rise to a strong p-n

on the absolute α-decay widths in 212Po and nearby
nuclei was usually neglected in microscopic calculation,
since the low-lying proton and neutron single-particle
states are very diﬀerent from each other in these cases
[21, 34, 35]. However, several theoretical treatments
[36–38] pointed to the particular signiﬁcance of p-n
interaction in α decay for these nuclei.

In this Letter, we report on the observation of a new
isotope 214
92 U122 and on more precise measurements for
the α-decay properties of 216,218U (N = 124, 126). In this
region of nuclei, the protons and neutrons can occupy
the π1f7/2 and ν1f5/2 spin-orbit partner orbits to a
large extent. Thus, such nuclei can provide a unique
opportunity to test the inﬂuence of p-n interaction on
α-particle clustering in heavy nuclear region.

To produce 214,216,218U nuclei, a series of experiments
were performed at the gas-ﬁlled recoil separator, SHANS
(Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and Nuclear Structure)
[39], at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou

(HIRFL), China.
reaction of 182W(36Ar, 4n)214U with a beam energy of
184 MeV and a typical beam intensity of ∼500 pnA
was used. The 182W targets with a thickness of 300-
350 µg/cm2 were prepared by sputtering the material
onto 80-µg/cm2-thick carbon foils and then covered by
10-µg/cm2-thick carbon layer. The recoiled evaporation
residues (ERs) were separated eﬃciently by SHANS
and collected by three 16-strip position-sensitive silicon
detectors (PSSDs), which were mounted side by side at
the focal plane of the separator. Each PSSD has an active
area of 50×50 mm2. Due to the shallow implantation
depth of ∼4 µm, the full-energy α particles emitted from

Rasmussen method [26], see Fig. 3(a). The uncertainties
of δ2 values are mostly due to the half-life uncertainties.
The 214,216,218U values determined in this work are shown
in column 4 of Table I and plotted by ﬁlled circles in
Fig. 3(a).

In each of the Po, Rn, Ra, and Th isotopic chains,
a sharp decrease of reduced widths at N = 126 is
well-established, indicating a notable neutron shell eﬀect
[26, 54, 55]. Our new data suggest for the ﬁrst time
that the minimum decay width for U isotopes is likely
at 218U (N = 126). This result is in contrast with
our previous work [44], where only half a value of
δ2(216U) (34+34
−11 keV) was reported. A shrinking of the δ2
enhancement between the N = 126 and N = 130 isotones
with the increasing of proton number was attributed to
a weakening of the N = 126 shell eﬀect as suggested in
Ref. [12]. The nearly constant or even decreasing values
for the most neutron-deﬁcient polonium isotopes were
explained by the conﬁguration mixing eﬀect [11, 20].

In Fig. 3(a), another important feature revealed by our
new data is that, while the decay widths at N = 122, 124,
and 126 for Po–Th isotopes increase monotonously with
increasing proton number, an unexpected sharp increase
was observed from Th to U isotopes at the same neutron
numbers. This suggests that the α-particle formation
probability is enhanced in these U isotopes.

In order to get a deeper insight into the behavior
of reduced widths, we studied the inﬂuence of the p-n
interaction upon the α-decay process in this mass region.
Given the fact that the NpNn scheme [56, 57] allows a
uniform description of structure evolution for a variety
of observables and highlights the importance of valence
p-n interaction [1, 2, 58–61], the δ2 values are plotted
against NpNn in Fig. 3(b). Here, Np and Nn are the

width calculation for 216U.

displayed in Fig. 2. The measured decay properties of
daughter products match well with the known data [42]
for 210Th, 206Ra, 202Rn, and 198Po. Based on these
measurements, the mean α-particle energy and half-
life of 214U were determined to be 8533(18) keV and
0.52+0.95
−0.21 ms, respectively, which are listed in Table I. The
uncertainties of half-life were estimated by the maximum
likelihood method described in Ref. [43]. The production
cross section for 214U was determined to be 10+14

−7 pb.

The properties of 216U, which was the lightest even-
even uranium isotope known previously, were reported
in our previous work [44] and in Refs. [45, 46]. However,
at most four decay chains from the ground state of 216U
were observed in each study, resulting in a relatively
large uncertainty of decay half-life.
In the present
investigation, the same experimental setup as for 214U
was used, but with a reaction of 180W(40Ar, 4n)216U at
a beam energy of 191 MeV. Thirteen decay chains were
assigned to the ground-state-to-ground-state (g.s.-to-g.s.)
decay of 216U. The deduced decay energy and half-life of
216gU are 8374(17) keV and 1.28+0.49
−0.28 ms, respectively.
By combining all data from the present study and from
Refs. [44–46], the averaged half-life for the ground state
of 216U was deduced to be 2.25+0.63
−0.40 ms. The results are
compared with the literature data in Table I.

In order to obtain more precise decay properties of
218U, two experiments with 182W(40Ar, 4n)218U and
184W(40Ca, α2n)218U reactions were carried out with
beam energies of 190 MeV and 206 MeV, respectively.
Totally, 76 decay chains were assigned to the decay from
the ground state of 218U, leading to the determination
of Eα = 8612(14) keV and T1/2 = 0.65+0.08
−0.07 ms. The
uncertainties of half-life were improved in comparison
with previous results [44, 47–49] (see Table I).

To study the nuclear structure evolution in the N =
126 region, the reduced widths δ2 for g.s.-to-g.s. decays
of even-even 84 ≤ Z ≤ 94 nuclei are extracted by using

Refs. [11, 12, 42, 50–53]. The values for 214,216,218U from this

numbers of valence protons and neutrons relative to the
nearest closed shells: Z = 82 for proton and N = 126
for neutron.
It is striking to see that the NpNn plot
displays a remarkable simpliﬁcation for the systematics
of decay widths in this region. In the N > 126 region,
the δ2 values increase rapidly until NpNn ≈ 20, and then
converge into a nearly constant value of ∼150 keV (except
for 222U). This “saturation” phenomenon might indicate
that the α decays in these nuclei are aﬀected only slightly
by the p-n interaction, but are dominated by the p-p and
n-n pairing interactions, as pointed out theoretically in
Refs. [21, 34, 35]. In other words, it is the strong pairing
force among the protons and neutrons occupying high-j
orbits (e.g., π0h9/2 and ν1g9/2) which leads to the large
α-particle formation probability [11].

In contrast, for the N < 126 nuclei, the δ2 values
for Po–Th isotopes show quite diﬀerent behaviors,
increasing exponentially with increasing the absolute
NpNn quantity along a relatively compact tendency
(except for 186,188Po). The increasing trend can be partly
explained by the increasing neutron and proton pairing
correlations [11] as one moves away from N = 126 and

Z = 82. More importantly, considering that the NpNn
value provides a reliable measure of interaction between
the valance protons and neutrons [1, 2], this speciﬁc
feature shown in Fig. 3(b) implies that the p-n interaction
can also play an essential role in the α-particle clustering
in this region.

The δ2 values of 214,216U, however, show striking
discrepancy with the uniﬁed trend established for 84 ≤
Z ≤ 90 and N < 126 nuclei. Regardless the relatively
large uncertainties for 214U, a signiﬁcant enhancement
by a factor of two is revealed for 214,216U as shown in
Fig. 3(b). This new feature might be related to the
possible changes of occupancy of 0h9/2 and 1f7/2 proton
Indeed, below Z = 92,
orbits approaching Z = 92.
it is expected that the 0h9/2 protons play a dominant
role, which is conﬁrmed by, e.g., the 9/2− ground states
for most of odd-A 83Bi, 85At, 87Fr, and 89Ac isotopes
[42]. The 0h9/2 orbit is expected to be highly occupied
in U (Z = 92) with an enhanced probability of proton
occupancy of the higher-lying 1f7/2 orbit. The later,
combined with the neutron occupancy of 1f5/2 orbit
around N = 118–124, might lead to a strong monopole
p-n interaction (see inset of Fig. 4(b)), which enhances
the preformation probability in α decay.

In order to verify this conjecture, we have performed

1f5/2, and 2p1/2 orbits were selected for protons and
neutrons. The single-particle energies are ﬁxed to those
of 209Bi and 207Pb. The p-p, n-n, and p-n parts of

orbits in N = 122, 124, and 126 even-Z isotones are
shown in Fig. 4(a). It can be seen that, due to the pairing
correlation eﬀect [1], the valence protons occupy mainly
the 0h9/2 orbit with the increasing occupation probability
of the 1f7/2 and 0i13/2 protons from Po to Pu isotopes.
In particular, the eﬀective proton occupation numbers
for the 1f7/2 orbit in U and Pu isotopes are almost equal
to or even higher than one.

limit,

The calculated monopole matrix elements between the
proton and neutron orbits for the Z > 82 and N ≤
126 nuclei are shown in Fig. 4(b). The calculations
demonstrate that all the p-n interactions involving 1f7/2
protons are about twice more attractive than those
involving 0h9/2 and 0i13/2 protons.
In particular, the
π1f7/2–ν1f5/2 interaction is by far the strongest one
in this region of nuclei. Therefore, the strong p-n
interactions related to the 1f7/2 protons, together with
the increased occupancy of the π1f7/2 orbit, would lead
to the enhanced α-particle formation probability in the
N = 122, 124, and 126 uranium isotopes.

In summary, a new isotope 214U was identiﬁed and
improved α-decay properties of 216,218U were measured
by employing the gas-ﬁlled recoil separator SHANS and

N < 126 and N > 126 nuclei in terms of NpNn scheme.
The behavior in the N < 126 region indicates a crucial
role played by p-n interaction in α decay. Meanwhile, it
is strikingly found that the reduced widths of 214,216U are
enhanced remarkably by a factor of two relative to the
systematic trend of N < 126 nuclei in the NpNn scheme.
This might be explained as being due to the strong
monopole interaction between the valence 1f7/2 protons
and 1f5/2 neutrons combined with increased occupancy
of the f7/2 proton orbit, which was conﬁrmed by the
large-scale shell model calculations.

As a possible outlook for the future studies in this
region, it is expected that, in view of the continuously

5

increasing proton occupancy of the 1f7/2 orbit and the
further enhancement of p-n interaction, this eﬀect might
become even stronger in the Pu isotopes. Thus, it is
extremely intriguing to extend the δ2 systematics to
higher-Z nuclei.

The authors would like to thank the accelerator
crew of HIRFL for providing the
stable beams.
