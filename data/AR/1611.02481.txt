Abstract. We report on a measurement of the attenuation length for the scintillation light
in the tonne size liquid argon target of the ArDM dark matter experiment. The data was
recorded in the ﬁrst underground operation of the experiment in single-phase operational
mode. The results were achieved by comparing the light yield spectra from 39Ar and 83mKr
to a description of the ArDM setup with a model of full light ray tracing. A relatively low
value close to 0.5 m was found for the attenuation length of the liquid argon bulk to its own
scintillation light. We interpret this result as a presence of optically active impurities in the
liquid argon which are not ﬁltered by the installed puriﬁcation systems. We also present
analyses of the argon gas employed for the ﬁlling and discuss cross sections in the vacuum
ultraviolet of various molecules in respect to purity requirements in the context of large liquid
argon installations.

The scintillation light of liquid argon (LAr), emitted in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) in
a narrow band around 127 nm, is well described by the formation and decay of argon ex-
cimers [1–4]. In this work we investigate the inﬂuence of impurities on the VUV light yield
in a tonne scale LAr target. In particular the following two processes are considered, the
non-radiative destruction of excimers states, often referred-to as (impurity) quenching, and
secondly and more important the absorption of produced VUV scintillation light during its
propagation through the LAr bulk. By ﬁrst principles both eﬀects trace back to the presence
of impurities in the argon.

Collisional quenching of excimers by impurities is a well known phenomenon in LAr,
becoming especially obvious due to the long lifetime of the triplet excimer state. The eﬀect is
determined by the two-body interaction rate which is competing with the radiative decay [5,
6], and leads to an apparent reduction of the emission time of the slow light component. As a
consequence the light pulse shape, respectively the component ratio CR 1, change accordingly.
It is possible to reconstruct the undisturbed shape from the literature value of the triplet
lifetime in a pure argon environment [7] and to determine the strength of this eﬀect. Its exact
quantitative estimation often lacks the knowledge of the collisional cross section. The eﬀect
of impurity quenching in LAr due to the varying concentrations of O2, N2 and CH4 can be
found in literature [6, 8–10].

The absorption of LAr scintillation light propagating through the bulk is strictly bound
to the presence of impurity states, since pure argon is fully transparent to its own scintillation
light. Elastic interactions of VUV photons with argon atoms, e.g. Rayleigh scattering, are
possible, but only aﬀect the direction of light propagation. The process of absorption is
quantiﬁed by a wavelength dependent cross section of molecules, which is often referred to
a molecular oscillator strength in spectroscopy. Due to the high density of the liquid argon,
impurities at low concentrations (ppb) can have notable eﬀects on the scintillation yield [11],
above all in large detectors. Only a few elements dissolved in LAr (e.g. N2 and CH4) were
systematically studied with respect to the attenuation length for LAr scintillation light [10,
12], due to experimental diﬃculties (exponential law). No information on VUV absorption
can be derived from the pulse shape study, since fast and slow components are equally
aﬀected. In measurements of light absorption a possible re-emission from the impurities has
to be considered.

The VUV cross sections of a few elements diluted in LAr were compared to their proper-
ties in the gaseous phase and found to be consistent with the room temperature results [10,
12]. A small shift and a broadening of the absorption lines was perceived in spectroscopic
studies on elements embedded in liquid or solid argon. This can be attributed to the eﬀect
of the electronic band structure of the LAr [13] and to its high density. By comparison with
the gaseous phase, the main features of the spectra were found to be reproduced surprisingly
well. One of the most intensively studied objects in dense argon are Xe atoms [1, 13, 14].
In Section 5 we discuss the extrapolation of these studies to the estimation of molecular
absorption cross sections of several molecules embedded in LAr and compare to our work.
First of all, in Section 2, we start to give an overview of the simulation framework of the
ArDM experiment which is based on a description of the optical phenomena in the experiment
by ﬁrst principles. Section 3 presents the preparation of the data, which are analysed and
compared to simulations in Section 4. In Section 6 and 7 we discuss impurity trace analyses
on the argon gas employed for ﬁlling the ArDM detector for its ﬁrst underground operation.

2 Simulation of the ArDM detector

The ArDM WIMP detector[15] consists of a 850 kg active liquid argon target constructed as a
vertical cylindrical TPC of 80 cm diameter and 110 cm in height. Scintillation light produced
in the LAr is wavelength shifted on the side reﬂectors and diﬀused to two arrays of each 12
PMTs on top and bottom, which provide a photon counting light detection system (more
details can be found in [15–17]). In 2015 ArDM was operated for the ﬁrst time at the Spanish
underground lab Laboratorio Subterr´aneo de Canfranc (LSC) with a full LAr target in the
single-phase operational mode [17].

2.1 Simulation of the physics processes

The response of the ArDM detector to particle interactions is calculated using the Geant4
toolkit [18]. All relevant particles (electrons, photons, neutrons and ions), described by a
physics list, are considered for scattering oﬀ argon atoms or nuclei, taking also into account
the subsequent physics phenomena. A custom made scintillation process was introduced for
the simulation of the light emission for electron and nuclear recoil events in liquid and gaseous
argon.

The scintillation light in gaseous and liquid argon is a result of the energy deposition
by ionising particles leading to the production of excitons and free charges. Both contribute

– 2 –

to the formation of excimers, in the ﬁrst case via the well understood process of self-trapping
of excitons, in the second via the recombination of electrons. The number of produced
singlet and triplet excimer states and hence the intensities of the fast (Ifast) and slow (Islow)
components of the emitted VUV light depend on type and energy of the incident particle
(ionisation density dependence) 2. The exploitation of this eﬀect for the discrimination of
background is particularly promising in LAr due to large diﬀerence of the lifetimes of the
two excimer states. The light pulse shape can be parameterised by a component ratio CR
deﬁned as CR = Ifast/(Ifast + Islow). Above roughly 50 keV, the observed values for CR are
about 0.25 for minimal ionising particles (electron recoils), as well as about 0.75 for nuclear
recoils and alpha particles [21, 22].

The ArDM simulation code uses the energy expenditure W = 19.5 eV [23] to calculate
the average total number (cid:104)N (cid:105) of VUV scintillation photons (of energy E = 9.68 eV) in liquid
argon for a given energy deposit Edep , i.e. (cid:104)N (cid:105) = Edep/W . The photon numbers of the fast
and slow scintillation components are generated according to Poissonian PDFs and a value
for CR, corresponding to the interaction type. The spatial position for the emission of VUV
photons is uniformly distributed along the step length of the propagating particle. The time
structure of the VUV emission is generated from a superposition of two exponential PDFs
with the time constants of the fast and slow scintillation components; for τfast a value of 7 ns
is employed [19], while for τslow the experimentally observed value of 1.23 µs is used 3. The
attenuation of the propagating VUV light is described by a simple exponential law with the
characteristic parameter λVUV, the VUV attenuation length. The wavelength shifting (WLS)
eﬃciency of the thin TPB (tetraphenyl butadiene) coatings applied to the inner detector
surfaces, is considered in the simulation by values ranging from 0.7 to 0.95, according to
the diﬀerent layer thicknesses, e.g. for the side reﬂectors and PMT coatings. The emitted
(optical) spectrum is centred around 435 nm with a FWHM of about 180 nm. Optical photons
are isotropically emitted by the WLS and are propagated through the detector by ray tracing,
applying all relevant physics processes (e.g. reﬂection, scattering, refraction, total reﬂection).
Both, the optical reﬂectivity R of the main reﬂector foil, together with the attenuation
length λVUV, are the main parameters to be varied and estimated from data by the Bayesian
ﬁtting technique described in Section 4. To cross check results the Rayleigh scattering length
l for VUV photons was varied in addition. In most part of this work a value of l = 55 cm (for
LAr scintillation light) was chosen, taken from literature [24].

2.2 Simulation of the detector components

In the simulation large emphasis was given to a detailed description of the material budgets
of the individual detector components to correctly describe particle interactions with the ex-
periment, as well as the eﬀect of radiation emitted from radioactive traces in materials on the
neutron and γ-backgrounds. The geometry of the ArDM experiment, as it is described in the
simulation, is illustrated in Fig 1, showing the inner detector components. The surrounding
main experimental dewar (not shown) containing the LAr target has a multi-layer structure
of stainless steel walls, LAr cooling layers, as well as vacuum sections. For simpliﬁcation it
is described by a single stainless steel layer of the same amount of material (of about 20 mm
thickness).

2For more details on the scintillation mechanism see e.g. [2, 19, 20]
3A value for τslow, widely used in literature, is 1.6 µs [19]

Figure 1. The simulated geometry of the ArDM experiment.

The 4 cm thick stainless steel top ﬂange of the experiment contains a number of pillars
reserved for cabling and cryogenic purposes. In the simulation the pillars are not included,
but the eﬀective amount of steel is accounted for by adjusting the thickness of the top ﬂange.
Two arrays of photomultiplier tubes (PMT), placed on the top and bottom of the main
dewar, provide the light detection for the experiment. The spherical geometry of the PMT
body is described using simple geometrical objects available in Geant4. The PMT surface
contains, going from outside to inside, the WLS layer made of TPB, a PMT glass window
and a thin photo cathode. After emission of a visible photon in the WLS material the photon
may undergo various optical boundary processes along the LAr - WLS, WLS - PMT glass,
PMT glass - PMT cathode boundaries. In the simulation a dT P B (cid:39) 10µm is used for the
thickness of the TPB layer. The optical surfaces on the LAr - WLS, WLS - PMT boundaries
are deﬁned as non-absorbing dielectric-dielectric surfaces with 100% Lambertian reﬂection
mode. Both VUV and visible photons can pass through the LAr - WLS surface, but VUV
light is fully absorbed on the WLS - PMT glass surface. No optical surface is deﬁned for

simulation the PMT cathodes are the sensitive detectors of the experiment. Optical photons
are detected with a detection probability depending on the hit position and impinging angle,
given by the manufacturer (Hamamatsu).

The ﬁeld shaper rings, mounted to vertical pillars, are arranged to generate a homoge-
neous electric drift ﬁeld in the ArDM detector. Presently the ﬁeld shaping system consists of
27 hollow stainless steel rings supported by 7 high density polyethylene pillars. In the work

– 4 –

described here no electric ﬁelds were applied for data taking and simulations.

The main and side reﬂectors, constructed from a sandwich of Tetratex (Donaldson
membranes) and a multilayer reﬂector foil (Vikuity ESR, 3M), are mounted onto the inner
sides of the ﬁeld shaper rings and are also coated with TPB. The optical boundary between
the TPB coating and the Tetratex foil is deﬁned to be dielectric and 100% Lambertian for
visible light. The value for its reﬂectivity R is roughly known from measurements in the lab
and subject to studies described in this work.

Cathode and protection grids, each about 95% transparent, are located at the bottom
of the main reﬂector, with the protection grid placed 13 cm below the cathode grid. The
interface to the LAr is deﬁned to be dielectric - metal and 100% Lambertian. The reﬂectivity
is set to a value of 50% , estimated from measurements in the lab.

2.3 Simulation of the PMT single photoelectron response

The response of the PMTs to a single photo-electron (pe) is approximated from the measured
PMT parameters by two Gaussian PDFs with σt = 3 ns for the temporal response, as well as
σph (cid:39) 0.35 · (cid:104)pe(cid:105) for pulse height ﬂuctuations; t0 is related to the arrival time of a detected
photon on the PMT cathode and (cid:104)pe(cid:105) corresponds to the mean single photo-electron charge.
The exact values for σph are taken individually for each of the 24 PMTs from a look-up table
obtained by calibration. This was done by adjusting the gains of all PMTs varying the HV
settings to have the same value for (cid:104)pe(cid:105) in all channels. The Gaussian shapes approximate
the photo-electron pulse responses closely.

Noise is generated in the ArDM simulation according to the measured dark count rates
and electronic pedestal ﬂuctuations (white noise). PMT dark counts occur randomly and
uniformly during data taking due to thermal emission of electrons from either the cathode or
one of the dynodes. The average dark count rate in the acquisition window is 0.01 pe/4µs.
Electronic white noise is simulated based on the Gaussian spread of pedestal distribution,
obtained from measurement. The signal over noise ratio for single photo-electrons is of the
order of S/N (cid:39) 40.

3 Preparation of data sets

A total of 3.3 billion triggers were recorded during ArDM Run I. About 10% of the data was
collected during calibration runs with radioactive test sources. All data was triggered under
the same conditions, a signal above ∼2 pe, in either the top, or bottom PMT array. With
the full size LAr target the trigger rate amounted to roughly 1.3 kHz, mainly due to β-decays
of 39Ar in the LAr target. About 10% of the triggers exhibit a much faster time structure
than signals created by argon scintillation light. Such events are characterised by small signal
amplitudes typical for single photon events ﬂuctuating above the 2 pe trigger level. A fraction
of those events contain higher amplitudes (up to ∼15 pe) implying other origins than thermal
emission of electrons in the photo cathodes, e.g. after-pulsing or ˇCerenkov light from the glass
of the PMT windows. These events can easily be discriminated and do not present serious
background to the data.

The analyses presented in this paper compare the measured energy spectra from two
data sets with Monte Carlo simulations. The ﬁrst set was prepared from data collected
without any calibration sources to study the 39Ar β-spectrum (endpoint 565 keV). The second
set consists of calibration data from 83mKr atoms (from a 83Rb source) injected into the gas

– 5 –

phase of the detector. The metastable atoms (mean life 1.8 h) deposit most of their de-
excitation energy (41.5 keV) via emissions of Conversion- and Auger-electrons. Technical
details about the 83mKr source installed in the ArDM setup can be found in [17]. The 39Ar
and 83mKr data sets were prepared by selecting events of the electron recoil type (ERL) and
a rough ﬁducialisation cut, as explained in the following.

Light yields are calculated by ﬁnding and summing clusters of photon signals over the
acquisition time of 4 µs. The light yields Ltop and Lbtm are calculated from the sum of all
signal clusters found in the top and bottom PMTs, respectively. The total light yield is
calculated from the sum of both, Ltot = Ltop + Lbtm. A vertical localisation parameter T T R
(top-to-total ratio) is introduced from the ratio of the top to the total yield, T T R = Ltop/Ltot.
This value is related to the vertical position of the event and used for ﬁducialisation cuts. We
also deﬁne a pulse shape parameter f 90, the ratio of the light detected in the ﬁrst 90 ns of the
event to the total yield. A cut on f 90 < 1 removes about 10% of the events, which originate
purely in noise. The ﬁnal data selection is done by the conditions 0.2 < f90 < 0.5 (f 90-cut)
and 0.2 < TTR < 0.8 (T T R-cut). In addition thresholds of 4 pe are applied for both, Ltop
and Lbtm, corresponding to a total energy threshold of about 8 keV. The remaining fraction
of events after applying these cuts amounts to 70% of the events selected by the f 90 < 1
condition, or hence 63% of the triggered data.

The same cuts are applied to the simulated data sets of pure 39Ar and 83mKr events
to evaluate the selection eﬃciencies. For each of them and each set of optical parameters,
200 k events were generated uniformly distributed over the volume of the active LAr target.
Here the f 90-cut rejects <2% of the 39Ar events and about 11% of the 83mKr events due to
larger statistical ﬂuctuations at the lower energies. About 20% of the events are removed
by the T T R-cut in both data sets. The overall selection eﬃciencies in the MC data sets are
78.5 ± 0.1% and 69.6 ± 0.1% for the 39Ar and 83mKr, respectively. γ background in the data
is not derived from simulation but parameterised by an exponential distribution (see Section
4.1).

4 Measured light yield

The light yield is determined by the response of the detector to the primary scintillation
light. It can be parametrised by a set of optical parameters of the Monte-Carlo model. The
exact values of the parameters are a priori not precisely known and need to be determined
from the data. From the large set of parameters in the model, we found that a few most
strongly aﬀect the detector response. In particular, the attenuation length λVUV of the argon
scintillation light in the liquid argon itself, and the reﬂectivity R of the reﬂector foil (in the
In a preliminary
following we refer to this parameter as “reﬂectivity”) are most critical.
analysis of Run I data a relatively small value far below 1 m was found for λVUV. Modelling
the data by a short Rayleigh scattering length could not reproduce the data. On the other
hand, a lower limit of 110 cm for the attenuation length of very pure (distilled) liquid argon
to its own scintillation light was recently found by experiment [11]. The low value observed
in our setup might be an indication for the presence of traces of impurities in the argon.
The relatively short attenuation length in our target is also aﬀecting the overall light yield,
which was found smaller than expected [17]. For future runs of ArDM it is therefore critical
to verify and understand the origin of the observed eﬀect.

In order to obtain a quantitative estimation of the VUV light attenuation length λVUV,
the measured light yields of 39Ar and 83mKr events were compared to Monte Carlo data sets,

– 6 –

in which λVUV, as well as the reﬂectivity R were scanned over the ranges of 40 - 200 cm
and 83 - 99% respectively. The estimates for both parameters describing best our data were
evaluated using a Bayesian likelihood maximisation technique described below. The Rayleigh
scattering length was kept ﬁxed at a value of 55 cm. In the simulation 39Ar beta electrons
were generated in a range of E = [3 keV, 600 keV] according to the theoretical spectrum
described by the phase space factors, the Fermi correction, as well as the ﬁrst forbidden
Gamow-Teller transitions [25–28]. 83mKr events were generated by electrons of a ﬁxed energy
of E = 41.5 keV. Events were homogeneously distributed in the liquid argon volume.

4.1 Bayesian parameter estimation method

The level of compatibility between data and simulation with a given set of parameters was
evaluated with a Bayesian method, using the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT)[29]. The BAT
framework allows to construct parametrised functional or template based models (likelihood
models) from theory or simulation, performing the numerical evaluation of the Bayes-theorem
on a data set (cid:126)D as follows,

p((cid:126)a| (cid:126)D) =

p( (cid:126)D|(cid:126)a)p((cid:126)a)
p( (cid:126)D)

,

(4.1)

where p((cid:126)a| (cid:126)D) denotes the conditional probability of the parameter set (cid:126)a given the data (cid:126)D,
p( (cid:126)D|(cid:126)a) denotes the conditional probability of the data set given a set of parameters (cid:126)a, and
ﬁnally p((cid:126)a) and p( (cid:126)D) denote the probabilities of the parameter set and that of the data,
respectively.

The conditional probability from the right-hand side of the Bayes-equation was evalu-
ated using the ArDM Monte Carlo simulation. We allowed for uniform prior probability for
each parameter value in the (λVUV, R) parameter space. In our Monte Carlo template based
likelihood model we constructed the conditional probability explicitly as,

p( (cid:126)D|(cid:126)a) =

(cid:89)

i

√

2πσ

e− (yi−f (xi;(cid:126)a))2

2σ2

(4.2)

where the product index i runs through all the data bins of the observable used for the
evaluation. In a given data bin, i, the likelihood model assumes bin entries with Gaussian
uncertainties parametrised as the discrepancy between the data bin entries, yi, and the
Monte Carlo simulation entries in the same bin, f (xi; (cid:126)a). The Monte Carlo prediction for
the number of events in bin i depends on the particular parameter set (λVUV, R), and a
linear interpolation was used to obtain the approximate distributions between the parameter
points. Light yield distributions in multiple TTR slices were used as the observable for the
evaluation. Various TTR values correspond to diﬀerent parts of the detector, and therefore
BAT performs a combined evaluation using information from diﬀerent parts of the ArDM
detector together. We also allow for an overall Monte Carlo scaling factor, A, to normalize
the events to the data.

In the case of 39Ar data analysis the likelihood model was constructed using the Geant4
39Ar simulation with an additional exponential term, with parameters B and C, for the
description of the gamma background in the high energy region. Therefore in the Bayesian
evaluation of the 39Ar data the following function was used for the light signal prediction in
bin i

f (xi; (cid:126)a) = A · gMC(xi; λVUV, R, 39Ar) + e(B+C·xi).

(4.3)

– 7 –

Here gMC(xi; λVUV, R, 39Ar) indicates the light signal prediction from the Monte Carlo sim-
ulation of 39Ar decays in bin i for the parameter values λVUV and R. A lower threshold of
200 pe was used for the 39Ar evaluation to avoid a trigger bias or problems due to low energy
backgrounds.

For the likelihood model of the 83mKr data the Geant4 83mKr simulation was used
together with the background from dedicated ArDM runs taken without Kr. The following
model was used,

f (xi; (cid:126)a) = A · gMC(xi; λVUV, R, 83mKr) + hbkg(xi),
where gMC(xi; λVUV, R, 83mKr) is the light signal prediction from Monte Carlo simulation of
83mKr, and hbkg(xi) is the contribution from ArDM Run I background runs. The background
was normalised to the data using the data acquisition time. In this case the signal dominates
the low energy region with a maximum at around 40 pe. A lower boundary of 20 pe was used
in the evaluation, which was varied for the estimation of systematic uncertainties.

(4.4)

The BAT evalution starts with a search for the global maximum of the full posterior.
Two separate algorithms were tried (Minuit MIGRAD and Simulated Annealing, see [29]
for further details) to check for the stability of the global maximum, both gave consistent
results. During the analysis ﬁrst the full parameter range of λVUV = [40 cm, 200 cm] and
R = [83%, 99%] was given to BAT. Then once the global maximum was established the
BAT ﬁt was repeated with the parameter range gradually reduced to be around the global
maximum for large statistics sampling. As an illustration of the BAT output the marginalized
posterior distribution for λVUV and R is shown from one of the 39Ar evaluations on Fig 2.
Similar results have been obtained for the 83mKr analysis. The maximum in the marginalized
distribution matches closely to the global maximum of the full posterior.

4.2 Results

The ﬁtting technique described above was applied to multiple groups of the data from ArDM
Run I. Results were found to be consistent over the entire run period spanning over more
than 6 months. The estimation of the parameters at the global maximum for the likelihood,
together with systematic uncertainties are shown in Table 1 for both, the 39Ar and 83mKr data
sets. Results agree on values of around 50 cm for the attenuation length λVUV and about 90%
for the reﬂectivity R. Systematic errors were obtained by variation of the energy threshold,
as well as the LY scale. The former, changing from 100 to 300 pe for the 39Ar, and 10 to
30 pe for the 83mKr data sets, produce uncertainties for λVUV of 10 and 5 cm, respectively.
An overall 5% error for the reﬂectivity is found. Varying the light yield scale by 10% (up

impact on R in the case of 39Ar, while in the case of 83mKr this variation impacts mainly
the reﬂectivity by about 7%. Therefore we presume an overall systematic uncertainty of 20%
for the values of λVUV and R. The stability of ﬁt results in respect to diﬀerent calibration
campaigns was cross-checked for data taken 24 hours before and after the 83mKr injections.
As mentioned above a smeared 39Ar beta spectrum and an exponential parametrisation of
the background was used for this purpose.

The generally good agreement between data and Geant4 simulations is illustrated in
Fig 3 for the 83mKr (left) and the 39Ar (right) data sets using parameters estimated at the
global maximum. The light yield spectra are shown for a single TTR slice. Data is drawn
by black dots while the Geant4 simulations are shown in red. The backgrounds which were
used in the spectral ﬁts are shown as gray shaded areas. They were derived from data taken
before and after the injection of 83mKr atoms (left), as well as the tail of the 39Ar spectrum
(exponential) above 800 pe (right).

To scrutinise the result of the short attenuation length we compare the data to simulated
39Ar and 83mKr spectra generated with a value of 200 cm for λVUV. Figure 4 shows again
the data (black dots) with solid lines representing diﬀerent stages of scaling and smearing of
the simulated spectra. From data generated in this way (blue) we scale the light yield by
an ad hoc value of 40% (green). Obviously the rescaled spectra can reproduce the average
yield, both for 83mKr and 39Ar , but distributions are much narrower than in the data. This
becomes particularly evident in the region between 500 and 800 pe for the 39Ar spectrum.
An additional ad hoc energy smearing of 30% (yellow) needs to be added to reproduce the

This exercise indicates the presence of a spatially non-uniform process causing a re-
duction and smearing of the light signal in the experiment. A short attenuation length for
VUV light traveling to a wavelength shifting surface, as well as eﬃcient transportation of
the shifted light to the PMTs, reproduce this eﬀect perfectly. We want to stress that this
observation became notable to such an extent only due to the large size of the liquid argon
target of the ArDM experiment.

In summary, the observed light yields and shapes of the 39Ar and 83mKr spectra suggest
a relatively short value of around 50 cm for the VUV attenuation length in the LAr target for
the ﬁrst data taken underground at the ArDM experiment. An hypothesis of the description
of the data with an expected value (e.g. 200 cm) for λVUV and an unrealisticly low value for
the reﬂectivity of the main reﬂector is clearly disfavoured. This result is also supported by
the analysis of the gas data which can be found elsewhere [17]. A description of the data
with a much reduced value for the Rayleigh scattering length, also does not ﬁt the data. We
interpret this result as the presence of optically active impurities in the liquid argon target
which seem not to be ﬁltered by the installed puriﬁcation systems (see Ref.[17] for details on
the puriﬁcation process).

In this section we estimate the VUV attenuation length for impurities dissolved in LAr in
dependence of a molecular absorption cross section σ and compare to our result. Later on we
evaluate cross sections of several relevant molecules in the spectral range of LAr scintillation
light. Figure 5 shows the calculated attenuation length λVUV, at a given concentration C.
The 3 diagonal lines illustrate the cases for σ = 0.01, 1 and 100 Mbarn. The attenuation
length was estimated from the total density of impurities,

where n = 2.1 · 1028 m−3 is the density of atoms of liquid argon. The horizontal dotted
line illustrates the value of 0.5 m for the attenuation length found in this work. The vertical
dotted line (1ppm) gives the upper limit for the sum of all impurities contained in the argon

pure. In particular an upper limit of 100 ppb is speciﬁed for the individual components of O2,
CnHm, CO, CO2 and H2, as well as 500 ppb for H2O and 300 ppb for N2, respectively. Water
(and oxygen) traces are ﬁltered-out by the installed puriﬁcation system, but are not explicitly
monitored. Due to its low cross section, nitrogen can be ruled out as aﬀecting strongly the
VUV absorption in LAr (see Table 2). The grey bar at λVUV = 50 cm in Fig. 5 indicates
the most probable range for impurity concentrations for this work, assuming maximal levels

Hence a photoabsorption cross section above 10 Mbarn is required to aﬀect
signiﬁcantly the VUV attenuation length in the LAr target of ArDM.

As mentioned above the Xe atom is a well studied object with respect to its oscillator
strength in a dense argon environment [1, 13, 14]. This is especially interesting for the fact
of the vicinity of its spectral lines to the emission spectrum of LAr. Very comparable results
were found for the absorption spectra of free and in argon embedded Xe atoms. E.g. the
well known atomic transitions 1S0 → 3P1 (146.9 nm) and 1S0 → 1P1 (129.7 nm) appear as
broadened and blue shifted (by 10 and 7 nm) lines for Xe atoms diluted in solid and liquid
argon host matrices respectively [1]. In the same work a similarly strong, additional absorp-
tion line at 127 nm was discovered, which was attributed to a Wanier-Mott type exciton state
formed by the interaction of the Xe with the band structure of the liquid argon. This obser-
vation was conﬁrmed in spectroscopic studies of VUV attenuation of LAr [14] and exposes
Xe as a primary candidate for absorbing LAr scintillation light. From the same work an

eﬀective cross section of 35 Mbarn was estimated from the width of the absorption spectra
around 127 nm [30], consistent with the value of about 25 Mbarn derived from spectroscopic
measurements on Xe gas [31].

Further evidence for the valid extrapolation of photoabsoprtion properties from the
gaseous phase to the one in LAr, is derived from two direct measurements of VUV absorp-
tion of LAr bulk doped with diﬀerent quantities of the absorber under investigation. The

values as grey dots together with several selected molecular VUV absorption cross sections
relevant for this work (plotted as solid and dashed lines). The data was taken from the web
site of MPI/Mainz [32]. For N2 only one data point (at 123 nm) was available and is marked
by an asterisk. The low values (and scarce data) are due to a large drop in the oscillator
strength between the ionisation edge at 14.5 eV (85 nm) and onset of the atomic lines at
around 400 nm. Figure 6 also shows the LAr emission spectrum taken from [14] plotted in
arbitrary units (grey). The spectrum follows closely a Gaussian centred around 127 nm with
a FWHM of 7.5 nm.

Based on the observed blue shift of the Xe spectrum and the the further evidence from Hg
embedded in dense argon (the 184.5 nm line was found to be shifted to 178.5 nm [33–35])
we apply a blue shift of 7 nm to all absorption spectra for the calculation of the integral,
corresponding to a small energy shift due to the band structure of LAr. We also shift the

not be calculated from spectra (due to missing data), but were taken from references [12]
and [31] respectively. Molecules with cross sections in the range of 10 Mbarn are potential
candidates for the short attenuation length found in this work.
In the following chapter
we discuss results derived from the lifetime of the slow scintillation component, as well as
measurements of the argon purity by means of trace analysers.

6 In-situ measurements on the bulk argon

The lifetime τslow of the slow scintillation component can be used as an indicator for the
presence of impurities in argon. In liquid argon the eﬀect of impurity quenching was studied
in detail for the elements O2, N2 [6, 8, 9] and CH4 [10]. Measurements done in gaseous
argon [7, 36] show evidence that quenching eﬀects of O2 and H2O are roughly equivalent.

In ArDM the slow scintillation component was continuously monitored over the period
of data taking and was stable to a level of a few percent. This was also true during the
ﬁlling of the LAr target, a strong hint for introducing the impurities together with the argon
gas. Figure 7 shows the ﬁt results for λVUV (black dots) over a period of about 100 runs
around the time when a manipulation on the gaseous recirculation system was undertaken
(arrow). A small decrease of about 1% is found in τslow (open circles) before the value

Figure 7. Run by run estimates of λVUV over a range of 100 runs (black dots, left scale). The
open circles (right scale) show the corresponding values for τslow which are aﬀected by a experimental
manipulation injecting some traces of H2O (see text).

restores again to about 1.25 µs. The decrease is presumably due to the injection of traces
of water molecules stemming from outgassing warm detector components. On the scale of
the statistical ﬂuctuations no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the value of λVUV can be observed. The
measured value of τslow ≈ 1.25 µs however is about 25% smaller than the literature value
of 1.6 µs [19] which is commonly regarded as a good estimate for the natural lifetime of the
triplet excimer state. This observation gives further evidence for the presence of impurities
in the argon and quenching the light yield by about 16% for electron like events. From
τslow = 1.25 µs found in this work and [9, 10] we estimate upper limits of 100 ppb for the
concentrations of O2, H2O and CH4 impurities, and about 1 ppm for N2 in the ArDM LAr
target of Run I.

In addition to the analyses of pulse shapes the levels of O2 and N2 in the LAr target
of ArDM were directly measured by means of two dedicated trace analysers. For oxygen
the model AMI 2001RS5 was employed, based on an electrochemical oxygen sensor ranging

about 0.5% of the full scale can be reached, i.e. 50 ppb.

The nitrogen trace in argon analyser, GOW-MAC 1200 Series6, is based on a spectral
measurement of glow discharges by means of a PMT. It has two measurement ranges: 0–
10 ppm and 0–100 ppm, with accuracies of ±0.25 ppm and ±2.5 ppm, respectively.

Prior to measurements the two analysers were calibrated using premixed gases, 10 and
100 ppm oxygen and 50 ppm nitrogen in argon. The calibrations were veriﬁed ﬂowing Ar-
5.0 grade (99.999% pure) gaseous argon, where ppm level of traces were measured for both,
oxygen and nitrogen, as expected. For each of oxygen and nitrogen, the measurements were
performed taking argon gas from two diﬀerent points in the ArDM system: (1) at the outlet
of the LAr recirculation pump, where the sampled gas was considered to be boil-oﬀ of the
liquid and (2) at the gas recirculation line, where the sampled gas was considered to be the
gas stratifying on top of the LAr target in the vapour phase. After connecting the device to
the system, gas was ﬂown for several hours through the device, which is suﬃcient to reach
the maximal sensitivity of the instruments.

All measured results were consistent with zero within the measurement sensitivities.
Considering the intrinsic sensitivities of the devices as mentioned above, and the ﬂuctuation
of the measured values, we estimate the upper limits of 0.1 and 0.5 ppm, for the oxygen and
nitrogen concentrations, respectively. The same result was found for both, the liquid and the
gaseous phase of the ArDM target.

7 Mass spectrometric measurements

In addition to the in-situ measurements a gas sample was taken for mass spectroscopical
analyses, mainly to address impurities of higher masses (>80 amu) like Kr and Xe, which
as mentioned above are known for their large cross sections to the LAr scintillation light.
This measurement was done in collaboration with the Ionizing Radiation and Dosimetry
Group of CIEMAT with a high resolution mass spectrometer evidencing diﬀerences in the
mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ionised atoms or molecules below ppb levels.

The inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) is a popular technique
used to determine the concentrations in the trace and ultra-trace range by counting the
number of atoms of the element which are detected. The sample is ionised by means of a
plasma source, and then the ion beam is transferred to a quadrupole m/z ﬁlter. A drawback of
the plasma ion source is the decomposition of many lighter molecules due to the high plasma
temperature. For this reason only spectra at the larger masses could be scanned. The isotopic
abundances are recorded from count rates at diﬀerent m/z values of the quadrupole ﬁlter. The
total concentrations of elements are ﬁnally found by summing over corresponding isotopes.
Concentrations down to the ppq range (pg/L) can be obtained (mainly limited by sample
preparation before its examination), giving both the elemental and isotopic information with
minimal measurement time (≈ minutes).

The argon analysis has been carried out introducing the gas directly in a high reso-
lution ICP-MS Element XR (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with double focusing reverse Nier-Johnson
geometry and SEM/Faraday detectors. Several runs have been undertaken. In particular
the ArDM gas, nominally of the ALPHAGAZ-2 type (N60, 99.9999% purity), was screened
and also compared to ALPHAGAZ-1 (N50, 99.999% purity) supplied by AirLiquide Spain

to CIEMAT-Madrid 7. The detector has been calibrated with standard samples of known
concentrations and the gas has been ﬂushed through the spectrometer in order to minimise
backgrounds.

Figure 8. Elements detected in the ICP mass spectral analysis for ALPHAGAZ-1 and -2. The signal
strengths were calculated from the integral over all isotopes of the elements.

Data with diﬀerent gas ﬂuxes have been taken by changing the input pressure of the gas.
The results evidenced traces of Xe and Kr in the argon with an estimated concentration of less
than 1 ppb for the ArDM gas and at least one order of magnitude more for ALPHAGAZ 1.
The only other trace evidenced, which is by far the most dominant (Fig. 8), has been identiﬁed
as Hg at the level of 10 ± 5 ppb. The Hg identiﬁcation was surprising, but is clearly established
by the relative natural abundance of diﬀerent isotopes. The Hg signal has been calibrated
with standard samples of known concentrations (Standard TraceCERT R(cid:13) from Sigma-Aldrich,
1000 mg/L Hg with 12% HNO3), and the error on the measured contamination is mainly given
by the uncertainty determining the argon ﬂux through the instrument. It has been found that
the Hg concentration is three times larger in the ArDM gas compared to ALPHAGAZ-1. A
possible explanation was given by the admixture of H2 gas in the argon production process in
order to reduce the O2 content of natural argon. The water produced in this process is later
removed by a drier system. The manufacturer conﬁrmed that the H2 used during the process
is obtained by electrolysis with Hg electrodes, so an unknown level of contamination of Hg
vapour can be assumed for the H2 gas. The higher Hg contamination found for the ArDM
gas (ALPHAGAZ-2) in respect to the ALPHAGAZ-1, could origin in the heavier treatment
of the argon with H2 gas in order to reduce the O2 contamination further.

The oscillator strength of Hg for absorption in the VUV range around 127 nm is not well
explored. Similar to N2, Hg seems to show very little optical activity in the range between the
ionisation edge ( 120 nm, probably blue shifted in LAr) and the strong UV transition around
184.5 nm (shifted to 178.5 nm in solid argon [33–35]). An unrealistic large cross section of
100 Mbarn would be required for 10 ppb Hg atoms in LAr to cause an attenuation length

exclude heavier rare gases. For Xe a cross section of about 1GBarn would be required, about
a factor 30 more than estimated by [30] (35 Mbarn).

QMS measurements at the low mass range To cross check impurity levels quoted by
the manufacturer we investigated a gas sample from the ArDM target in the laboratory by
means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer type QMS 200 M from the company PFEIFFER.
The mass spectrum was also compared to argon gas of the same nominal quality (N60) from
a local supplier. The system was baked (up to 150◦C) and pumped (below 10−9 mbar) for
several weeks. Within the sensitivity of the instrument (≈10 ppm) no abnormal activity in
the mass spectra could be observed.

8 Summary and conclusions

The study of the VUV light yield in the tonne scale LAr detector ArDM resulted in a lower
than expected value of 0.5 m for the attenuation length of the liquid argon bulk to its own
scintillation light. The result was found by means of a Bayesian variation technique and
yielded systematic uncertainties on the order of 20%. We interpret this result with the pres-
ence of optically-active trace impurities in the LAr which are not ﬁltered by the installed
puriﬁcation systems primarily designed to target O2 and H2O molecules. Based on the sev-
eral elements studied in literature, we ﬁnd evidence that optical parameters measured at
room temperature in the gaseous phase, can be transferred to a liquid argon environment.
However blue shifts (about 7 nm) of the spectra and broadenings of the lines are observed.
This allowed us to conduct a combined analysis of our result with respect to the involved
photoabsorption cross sections, the lifetime of the slow scintillation component, as well as
mass spectra taken on argon gas samples. A variety of impurity candidates could be ex-
cluded, respectively bound to upper limits in their abundance. Our data can be explained
by impurities with VUV absorption cross sections in the range of 10-100 Mbarn and concen-
trations of 10-100 ppb. Due to their small cross sections, an origin from CO2 and N2 can
primarily be excluded. Their concentrations would have to be increased by several orders
of magnitude to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the VUV attenuation length. Further on the mea-
sured lifetime of the slow scintillation component 1.25 µs constrains the concentrations of O2
and H2O to values below 100 ppb (as well as N2 to below 1 ppm). By high resolution mass
spectroscopy several heavier elements which are well known to exhibit large absorption cross
sections for LAr scintillation light could also be excluded. The concentrations measured for
Xe and Kr of ≤ 1 ppb would require cross sections in the GBarn range to aﬀect the VUV
attenuation length in the ArDM setup. CH4 is known to be present in argon gasses due to
its abundance in the atmosphere and a similar boiling point. A quantity of 100 ppb could
explain the observed value for the attenuation length, since its VUV cross section is of the
order of 10 Mbarn. The measured slow scintillation lifetime is just about compatible with
such a hypothesis [10].

Surprisingly also a small quantity of Hg (10 ± 5 ppb) was detected. Presumably Hg was
introduced as a residuum during the H2 cleaning cycle (to remove O2) in the manufacturing
process of the gas. However to aﬀect signiﬁcantly the attenuation length the cross section
and concentration of Hg are too low.

Elements which could not be excluded by this analysis are believed to be removable
with an upgraded puriﬁcation system. This is an important fact since in case of a major
presence of heavier rare gases, like e.g. Kr and Xe, the installation of a distillation system for

the LAr might have been required. A cold charcoal trap is being added to the puriﬁcation
circuit of ArDM. Cold charcoal ﬁlters are known to reduce impurity levels of elements with
condensation points above the ﬁlter temperature by several orders of magnitude. Further
tests with the upgraded system will help conﬁrm the origin of the impurities.

The results of the work presented here has pointed out that other trace elements than
the usually targeted water and oxygen molecules might aﬀect the overall performance of a
liquid argon TPC. This observation will likely have some implications on the design and
optimisation of light detection systems and/or on the liquid argon puriﬁcation systems of
future large LAr detectors, where scintillation light attenuation length in excess of meters
will be desirable.
