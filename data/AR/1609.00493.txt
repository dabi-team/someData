ABSTRACT
In view of the new recent observation and measurement of the rotating and highly-
magnetized white dwarf AR Scorpii Marsh et al. (2016), we determine bounds of its
moment of inertia, magnetic ﬁelds and radius. Moreover, we investigate the possibility
of fast rotating and/or magnetized white dwarfs to be source of detectable gravi-
tational wave (GW) emission. Numerical stellar models at diﬀerent baryon masses
are constructed. For each star conﬁguration, we compute self-consistent relativis-
tic solutions for white dwarfs endowed with poloidal magnetic ﬁelds by solving the
Einstein-Maxwell ﬁeld equations in a self-consistent way. The magnetic ﬁeld supplies
an anisotropic pressure, leading to the braking of the spherical symmetry of the star.
In this case, we compute the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution. Next, we
perform an estimate of the GW of such objects. Finally, we show that the new recent
observation and measurement pulsar white dwarf AR Scorpii, as well as other stel-
lar models, might generate gravitational wave radiation that lies in the bandwidth of
the discussed next generation of space-based GW detectors DECI-hertz interferometer
Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and Big Bang Observer (BBO).

Key words: white dwarfs– magnetic ﬁeld – rotation – gravitational waves

1 INTRODUCTION

Some white dwarfs (WD) are associated with strong mag-
netic ﬁelds. From observations, it was shown that the sur-
face magnetic ﬁeld in these stars can reach values up
to 109 G, see Terada et al. (2008); Reimers et al. (1996);
Schmidt & Smith (1995); Kemp et al.
(1970); Putney
(1995); Angel (1978). However, the internal magnetic ﬁeld
in stars is very poorly constrained by observations and can
be much stronger than the one at the surface. A virial-
theorem based estimate by equating the magnetic ﬁeld en-
ergy with the gravitational biding energy leads to an up-
per limit for the magnetic ﬁelds inside WD’s of ∼ 1013
G (Shapiro & Teukolsky 2008). On the other hand, in the
context of exploring overluminous type Ia supernovae and
the possible existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs,
diﬀerent numerical calculations suggest that white dwarfs
might have internal magnetic ﬁelds as large as 1012−16
G (Das & Mukhopadhyay 2013; Bera & Bhattacharya 2016;
Franzon & Schramm 2015).

Due to their large radius compared to neutron stars,
white dwarfs present a diﬀerent scale in their macroscopic

stellar properties, like the moment of inertia, magnetic mo-
ment, rotational frequency and quadruple moment. This, to-
gether with the fact that white dwarfs are found closer to
earth, is one of the reasons why white dwarfs are much more
understood than neutron stars.

The main motivation of this work is provided by the re-
cent binary system discovered by Marsh et al. (2016). This
system is composed of a main sequence star and a fast spin-
ning and magnetized white dwarf with a mass that lies in the
range 0.81M⊙ < Mwd ≤ 1.29M⊙. The pulsating white dwarf is
called AR Scorpii, AR Sco for short, and such a system has
never been observed orbiting a cool red dwarf star. In the
case of AR Sco, this was the ﬁrst radio pulsations detected
in any white dwarf system. In addition, due to its high mag-
netic ﬁeld combined with rotation, such type of WD’s are
called ‘white dwarf pulsar’.

The rapidly-spinning and magnetized stellar remnant
AR Sco pulses across almost the entire electromagnetic
spectrum, from X-ray to radio wavelengths. Up to now,
pulsating stars were related to neutron stars (NS), which
can be rotating and highly magnetized, emitting a beam
of electromagnetic radiation. Typically, white dwarfs rotate
with periods of days or even years. On the other hand, ac-
cording to Mereghetti et al. (2009), one of the fastest ob-
served WD possesses a spin period of 13.2 s, a value simi-

lar to the ones observed in Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGR)
and Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXP), known as magnetars
(Duncan & Thompson 1992; Thompson & Duncan 1993). A
relation between WD’s and magnetars was addressed by
Malheiro et al. (2012), where the authors speculated that
SGR’s and AXP’s with low surface magnetic ﬁeld might be
rotating magnetized white dwarfs.

As in neutron stars, the origin of magnetic ﬁelds in
white dwarfs is still under debate. While the magnetic ﬂux
conservation of a progenitor remains an attractive possibil-
ity, a likely origin of the such strong magnetic ﬁelds is a
dynamo process that operates during the envelope evolu-
tion, see Ferrario et al. (2016). Recently, observations have
shown that the formation of high magnetic white dwarfs can
be related to strong binary interactions during post-main-
sequence phases of stellar evolution (Nordhaus et al. 2011).
Whatever the origin of strong magnetic ﬁelds might
be, they eﬀect the stars in diﬀerent ways. First, mag-
netic ﬁelds aﬀect locally the microphysics of the equation
of state through the Landau quantization of the energy
levels of charged particles. However, as already shown by
Bera & Bhattacharya (2014), although equation of state of
electron degenerate matter is strongly modiﬁed due to Lan-
dau quantization, this eﬀect is negligible on the global prop-
erties of white dwarfs. In fact, we already shown that in NS’s
the contribution to the structure of the star when taking
into account the magnetic ﬁeld corrections in the equation
of state is very small, see Franzon et al. (2016a). For this
reason, we do not take into consideration a magnetic-ﬁeld-
dependent equation of state in our calculation.

Secondly, magnetic ﬁelds are sources of the grav-
itational ﬁeld equations through the Maxwell energy-
momentum tensor. As a result, they make the pres-
sure anisotropic, which requires a general treatment be-
yond the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ (TOV) solutions
(Oppenheimer & Volkoﬀ 1939; Tolman 1939). In addition,
the Lorentz force induced by magnetic ﬁelds change the
structure of white dwarfs, which, in the case of poloidal
ﬁelds, become oblate objects. This is the same eﬀect as the
one produced by rotation. In both cases, the star deforma-
tion with respect to the magnetic and/or rotation axis can
be quantiﬁed by the stellar quadrupole moment.

As predicted by Einstein (1916), gravitational waves are
generated by objects that have quadrupole moment vary-
ing in time, such as colliding black holes, collapse of stellar
cores, coalescing neutron stars, white dwarf stars, etc. Such
systems disrupt the space-time producing GW that radiate
from the source and travel at the speed of light through the
Universe, carrying information about their sources, as well
as the nature of gravity itself.

Currently, the main ground-based gravitational waves
interferometer operating is the twin Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) which sensitivity
is designed to detect GW amplitude of one part in 1021
within the frequency bandwidth in the range 30 - 7000
Hz. In the next years, a second generation of detectors,
as for example, advanced-LIGO and advanced-Virgo, will
be operating. Furthermore, the space-based gravitational
waves detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
(Danzmann et al. 1996) has been planning to be launched.
LISA operates a space-based gravitational waves detector
sensitive at frequencies between 0.03 mHz and 0.1 Hz.

The Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Ob-
servatory (DECIGO) (Seto et al. 2001; Kawamura et al.
2006) is a plan of a future Japanese space mission for observ-
ing GW’s in frequency bandwidth similar to LISA, however,
at lower gravitational waves amplitudes. This fact, as we
are going to see, makes DEGICO suitable to detect gravi-
tational waves from fast rotating and/or magnetized white
dwarfs. Meanwhile, another space-based interferometer has
been proposed as a successor to LISA, the Big Bang Ob-
server (BBO) (Phinney et al. 2003), with both frequency
bandwidth and gravitational waves amplitudes similar to the
ones of DECIGO.

With this in mind, we make use of available data of AR
Sco, as its distance from Earth, its rotation frequency and its
mass range, to perform self-consistent rotating and magne-
tized white dwarf calculations and then determine bounds of
its radius, moment of inertia, quadruple moment and mag-
netic ﬁelds. With these results, we investigate the possibility
of rotating and magnetized white dwarfs to be sources of de-
tectable GW emission.

A white dwarf is a dense conﬁguration supported by
the electron degeneracy pressure against gravitational col-
lapse. Here, we describe the stellar interior assuming that
the star is predominately composed of carbon 12C (A/Z = 2)
in an electron background, see Chandrasekhar (1931). In
fact, white dwarfs are much less compact stars than neutron
stars, being easily deformed due to magnetic ﬁelds. Another
important point is that white dwarfs can be considered the
most closest astrophysical sources of gravitational waves.

We organise the paper in the following way.In Sec. 2 we
summarise the coupled Maxwell-Einstein equations and the
hydrodynamic equations in presence of a magnetic ﬁeld in
general relativity. In Sec. 3, we describe the results concern-
ing the inﬂuence of strong magnetic ﬁelds on the structure
of white dwarfs, in particular to the AR Sco star. Sec. 4 de-
scribes the eﬀects of rotation, combined also with magnetic
ﬁelds, on the detectability of gravitational waves emitted by
rotating and/or magnetized white dwarfs. Finally in Sec. 5,
we give our conclusions.

2 WHITE DWARFS WITH AXISYMMETRIC

MAGNETIC FIELDS

We follow the numerical
technique as developed by
Bonazzola et al. (1993); Bocquet et al. (1995) to obtain
magnetized white dwarf conﬁgurations in a fully gen-
eral relativity way. Within this approach, the Einstein-
Maxwell equations are solved numerically by means of a
pseudo-spectra method for axisymmetric stellar conﬁgu-
rations within the 3+1 formalism in General Relativity.
The accuracy of solutions is controlled by a 2D general-
relativistic virial theorem (Bonazzola et al. 1993) and, for
the stars presented here, it is typically of the order of 10−5.
Recently, this formalism was applied to neutron stars by
Franzon et al. (2016a,c,b) and to study magnetized white
dwarfs by Franzon & Schramm (2015).

With the assumption of a stationary and axisymmet-
ric spacetime, the line element in spherical-like coordinates

According to Salgado et al. (1994), global quantities as

values of f (x) = f0. The macroscopic electric current relates
to f0 as jf
(e + p) f0. Therefore, for higher values of the
current function, the electric current increases and, there-
fore, the magnetic ﬁeld in the star increases proportionally.
As already shown by Bocquet et al. (1995), the current func-
tion can have a more complex structure, however the general
conclusions remain the same.

3 GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF PULSAR WHITE

DWARF AR SCORPII

Stationary and axisymmetric conﬁgurations are calculated
once the EoS is speciﬁed, together with the rotation law,
the central energy density and the current function f0. In
our case, we chose to construct uniformly rotating and/or
magnetized models at a given baryon mass by varying the
star frequency and also f0. In our ﬁrst analysis, we chose to
study stellar conﬁgurations with masses between the maxi-
mum and the minimum possible stellar masses for the white
dwarf AR Sco, i.e., MB = 1.29, 1.18, 1.00, 0.81M⊙ . Further-
more, we ﬁx the stellar frequency at n = 8.538 mHz, which
is the observed frequency of this star. In fact, our results are
general and the approach shown here can be also applied to
other systems.

of central magnetic ﬁelds, Bc, for stellar conﬁgurations at
diﬀerent ﬁxed baryon masses. The same behavior as shown
in Fig. 1 was obtained for I as a function of polar surface
ﬁelds, Bs. I increases because magnetic ﬁelds deform the
star, which becomes larger in the equatorial plane. In Fig. 1,
the purely rotating contribution to the moment of inertia of
the system is found when Bc = 0. On this same ﬁgure, the
end points on the curves correspond to maximum magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁgurations achieved within the code. At this point,
the star becomes highly magnetized and deformed, reaching
a doughnut-shaped density distribution, see Cardall et al.
(2001). However, the numeric techniques described in sec-
tion II does not handle toroidal-shape solutions, which gives
us a practical limit within this approach.

According to Fig. 1, heavier WD’s can support higher
magnetic ﬁelds in their interiors. This is also seen from ob-
servation, where the majority of observed WD’s are more
massive than non-magnetized ones, see e.g. Boshkayev et al.
(2014) and references therein. This is simply because mas-
sive stars are more dense in their interiors, and in ideal mag-
neto hydrodynamics (MHD), the magnetic ﬁeld is ’frozen’
with the ﬂuid and, therefore, it is proportional to the lo-
cal mass density of the ﬂuid (Mestel 2012). Still accord-
ing to Fig. 1, heavier WD’s have smaller moment of iner-
tia. This is due to the fact the big radii of lighter white
dwarfs signiﬁcantly contribute to the momentum of iner-
tia of stars. For example, a star with MB = 1.29 M⊙ has
a maximum moment of inertia of I = 6.83 × 1042 kg.m2. In
this case, the central magnetic ﬁeld is Bc = 0.90 × 1013 G,
with the corresponding surface magnetic ﬁeld at the pole of
Bs = 8.95 × 1011 G. On the other hand, a less massive star at
a ﬁxed baryon of MB = 0.81 M⊙ has a maximum moment of
inertia of I = 22.47×1042 kg.m2, which is found when the cen-
tral magnetic ﬁeld is Bc = 0.13 × 1013 G and Bs = 2.14 × 1011
G on the surface.

In Fig. 2 we show the spin-down luminosity L as a func-
tion of the circular equatorial radius for the same stars as
already depicted in Fig. 1. In this case, the spinning star
loses energy at a rate L = −4p 2n ˙n I (Marsh et al. 2016),
with I being the moment of inertia, which is now a func-

tion of the magnetic ﬁeld I(B). Marsh et al. (2016) reported
also a stellar maximum luminosity for AR Sco to be about
Lobs ∼ 6.3 × 1025 W, which it is represented by the dashed
and black horizontal line in Fig. 2.

For a star with MB = 1.29 M⊙, and using the AR Sco
observed values for the frequency n = 8.538 mHz and the
frequency derivative ˙n = −2.86 × 10−17 Hz s−1 (Marsh et al.
2016), we obtain a stellar maximum luminosity of L ∼ 6.4 ×
1025 W, whose value matches the experimental maximum
luminosity of AR Sco (horizontal dashed line in Fig. 2) for a
star with MB = 1.29 M⊙. Moreover, the corresponding radius
of this star is Rcirc = 4080.00 km, for a central magnetic ﬁeld
of Bc ∼ 0.90×1013 G, which is almost the maximum magnetic
ﬁeld reached at the center of a star with MB = 1.29 M⊙, see
Fig. 1.

Nevertheless, any point on a curve lying above the
horizontal line of Fig. 2 could in principle explain the ob-
served luminosity of AR Sco, and thus any mass lower than
MB = 1.29 M⊙, with even a very low magnetic ﬁeld (or even
for non-magnetized white dwarf). For example, the star
with MB = 1.18 M⊙ has a corresponding spin-down luminos-
ity of L ∼ Lobs for central and surface magnetic ﬁelds of
Bc = 1.25 × 1011 G and Bs = 9 × 109 G, respectively. This
value of Bs, as well surface ﬁelds obtained with other choices
of (lower) stellar masses, are compatible to values of surface
magnetic ﬁelds experimentally observed in white dwarfs.
Note that, a lower magnetic ﬁeld implies a much lower ra-
dius, moment of inertia and, as we will see, a lower gravi-
tational wave amplitude. According to Fig. 2, if the white
dwarf has a higher observed luminosity, lower masses stars
would be favored to explain the AR Sco data.

Magnetic ﬁelds on the stellar surface can be estimated
from observations of the star’s period and period derivative.
In this case, one considers a magnetic dipole which rotates
and emits electromagnetic radiation. As a consequence, the
star loses energy and spin down. However, one usually uses
ﬁdudial parameters that do not depend on the magnetic ﬁeld
(for example, a constant moment of inertia I) to estimate
polar surface magnetic ﬁelds through the magnetic dipole
formula. For a star at MB = 1.18 M⊙, a trivial estimate of the

magnetic ﬁeld assuming a magneto-dipole radiation losses
gives for the surface magnetic ﬁeld Bs ∼ 109 G. In this work,
as we take into consideration the eﬀect of magnetic ﬁelds on
global properties of stars, we obtain surface magnetic ﬁelds
higher than just the dipole model.

4 GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FROM WHITE

DWARFS

The Lorentz and the centrifugal forces induced by magnetic
ﬁelds and rotation make the star oblate. In this case, the stel-
lar deformation can be quantiﬁed by the stellar quadrupole
moment, Q, measured with respect to the rotational axis, for
example. According to Bonazzola & Gourgoulhon (1996),
the gravitational wave amplitude h0 of a perpendicular ro-
tator can be estimated as:

h0 =

6G
c4

W 2

d

Q,

(16)

with G being the gravitational constant, c the speed of light,
d the distance of the star, and W
the rotation velocity of the
star. For all stars considered in this work, we use a distance
d ∼116 pc (1pc = 3.08×1013 km) which is the distance of
AR Sco from Earth, see Marsh et al. (2016). Although we
are ﬁxing d, note that the closer the star, the larger the
amplitude h0.

By means of the rotating and magnetic white dwarfs
calculations as already shown in Fig. 1, we make a crude
estimate of the GW strength emitted by these objects.
This is crude because the white dwarfs as computed here
have rotation and magnetic axes aligned. In this case, even
stars strongly deformed do not emit gravitational radiation
(Bonazzola & Gourgoulhon 1996). However, an estimate of
the strength of gravitational wave emission can be deduced
if we assume that the magnetic axis and the rotation axis
are not aligned. This is a good approximation since the rota-
tional and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects do not compete in deforming
the star because of the rather slow rotation.

Fig. 3 depicts the gravitational wave amplitude h0 for
white dwarfs at MB = 0.81 M⊙ and MB = 1.29 M⊙, respectively.

Pulsar white dwarfs

MB=1.29MO•

The higher the stellar mass, the smaller the h0. This is due to
the fact that a star with MB = 0.81 M⊙ has lower density that
is spread out over a larger radius. As a result, the star easily
becomes deformed through magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects and, there-
fore, its quadrupole moment is higher than in more massive
white dwarfs. For example, a white dwarf at MB = 0.81 M⊙
possesses a maximum GW amplitude of h0 = 1.85 × 10−22,
while we obtain a maximum value of h0 = 3.82 × 10−23 for
the star MB = 1.29 M⊙. Although in a diﬀerent frequency
band, these values are only one and two order of magni-
tude lower than the ﬁrst direct detection of gravitational
waves from black hole merger, see Abbott et al. (2016).
Note that, white dwarfs with lower masses have gravita-
tional wave amplitude of about three order of magnitude
higher than slow rotating and highly magnetized neutron
stars, see Franzon et al. (2016b); Bonazzola & Gourgoulhon
(1996); Bonazzola & Marck (1994). This is related to the
scale of the quadrupole moment, which is of the order of
Q ∼ 1042 kg.m2 in magnetic white dwarfs, while this value
reduces to ∼ 1038 kg.m2 for neutron stars. In addition, the
WD’s considered here are much closer to Earth than a typ-
ical neutron star, contributing to make them good sources
for gravitational wave emission and detection.

Fig. 4 shows the baryon number density proﬁle for a
star at MB = 1.29 M⊙, but in two diﬀerent scenarios: A) rotat-
ing at a frequency of n = 8.538 mHz, but without magnetic
ﬁelds and B) rotating at the same frequency as in A), but
endowed with magnetic ﬁelds. In the case A), the deviation
from spherical symmetry is very small, with the polar ra-
dius being 0.05% smaller than the equatorial radius. On the
other hand, in the case B), the circular equatorial radius is
4080.00 km in contrast to 3288.10 km in case A). The gravi-
tational wave amplitude in case A) is h0 = 2.46×10−26, while
this value raises to h0 = 3.82 × 10−23 with magnetic ﬁelds. In
face of this, one sees that the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds in
deforming the star and, therefore, contributing strongly to
GW emission is evident. Furthermore, one sees that the de-
viations from spherical symmetry are remarkable and need
to be taken into consideration while modeling highly magne-
tized white dwarfs. As a consequence, a simple TOV solution
can not be applied in these cases.

As it was already discussed, strong magnetic ﬁelds do
increase the quadruple moment of stars. For example, a ro-
tating and non-magnetized white dwarf, case A in Fig. 4, has
a quadruple moment of Q = 6.20 × 1038 kg.m2, while its mag-
netized counterpart, case B) in Fig. 4, supports a quadrupole
moment of Q = 1.12 × 1042 kg.m2. Again, this is due to the
Lorentz force associated with the macroscopic currents that
generate the ﬁeld, which pushes the matter oﬀ-center. As a
result, the stellar equatorial radius increases and the star be-
comes much more deformed with respect to the symmetry
axis. In this case, the baryon number density, nb, reached
at the center of the star is 6.30 × 107 g/cm3, which is one
order of magnitude smaller than the baryon number den-
sity of a purely rotating white dwarf, case A), which reaches
nb = 3.12 × 108 g/cm3 at its center.

In Fig. 5, we show the frequency bandwidth of diﬀerent
space-borne gravitational wave interferometers, the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), BBO and DECIGO.
On this ﬁgure, we show also the estimate of gravitational
wave amplitude for the same stars as shown in Fig. 3. First,
a white dwarf at MB = 1.29 M⊙, purely rotating at 8.538 mHz,

(right panel). In the ﬁrst case, the ratio between the polar and
equatorial radius is rp/req = 0.99, while for the magnetized white

is represented by the letter (d), and has h0 lower than those
ones expected to be detected by BBO and DECIGO. This
star, however, has its gravitational wave amplitude raised
with the inclusion of magnetic ﬁelds, case (c), and can, po-
tentially, be detected by BBO. This behavior is similar to
the case of a white dwarf at MB = 0.81 M⊙ (red line), which
lie in the amplitude range of both BBO and DECIGO when
magnetized, case (a), not being, however, a potential candi-
date when purely rotating, case (b).

In order to investigate stellar models diﬀerent from AR
Sco, as well if purely rotating white dwarfs are able to pro-
duce detectable GW, we include in Fig. 5 calculations for
magnetized and rotating white dwarf models at ﬁxed baryon
mass of MB = 0.50 M⊙. This star rotates at diﬀerent rotation
frequencies of f = 10−5 Hz (magenta line), 10−3 Hz (orange
line) and 10−2 Hz (green line), respectively. It is interesting
to see that the higher the frequency, the smaller the range
of the GW amplitude h0. This is due to the fact that the ro-
tational frequency limits further the density of the star and,
therefore, the magnetic ﬁeld.

As can be seen from Fig. 5, the white dwarf MB =
0.50 M⊙ rotating at f = 10−2 Hz, and without magnetic ﬁelds
(green line), can clearly be in the range of detectability of
the BBO detector. In this case, the rotating white dwarf has
a GW amplitude of ∼ 7 × 10−23. In addition, if this star is
magnetized, this would lead to a maximum GW amplitude
of the order of 2×10−22, which is in the range of detectability
of both BBO and DECIGO interferometers.

In Fig. 6, we show the GW amplitude h0 as a function of
surface magnetic ﬁelds, Bs, for the star MB = 0.50 M⊙ (green
line) as depicted in Fig. 5. We chose to show Bs instead the
magnetic dipole moment or the central magnetic ﬁeld since
this is the quantity that can be observed in white dwarfs.
Note that, according to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, BBO is also able
to detect GW from stars with low magnetic ﬁelds. The re-
sults of this analysis can be generalized to other frequencies
or masses. However, as the frequency increases, the star ap-
proaches to the mass-shedding (Kepler) limit, which for the
white dwarf MB = 0.50 M⊙ is f ∼ 0.02 Hz.

It is instructive to compare the white dwarf luminosity
due to emission of electromagnetic waves (assuming vacuum

dipole emission) and the luminosity due to gravitation waves
emission. The luminosity due to emission of electromagnetic
waves of a perpendicular rotator can be written as Ldip =
(2/3)R6B2W 4, see e.g. Shapiro & Teukolsky (2008). By using
values similar to those as depicted in Fig. 6, we have for
the spin-down luminosity L ∼ 1021 W and Ldip ∼ 1021 W. On
the other hand, by using the luminosity due to gravitational
waves of a given source as shown in Kokkotas (2002), we
obtain LGW ∼ 1019 W. Therefore, the spin-down luminosity
of the star is mainly due to dipole radiation.

According to Fig. 6, the magnetic ﬁeld that corresponds
to the minimum GW amplitude, h0 ∼ 2 × 10−22, that lies in
the DECICO range of detectability, is ∼ 3.2 × 1010 G. More
importantly, this value is just one order of magnitude smaller
than surface magnetic ﬁeld already observed in white dwarfs.
Therefore, both rotating and magnetized white dwarfs could
be good candidates of future GW observation and detection
by the new generation of GW interferometers. As already

discussed, the gravitational wave amplitude h0 can be ob-
tained in the regime of slow rotation and strong magnetic
ﬁelds from Eq. 16. However, it is to be noted that in the
regime of weak magnetic ﬁelds, rotation can induce stronger
eﬀects on the structure of white dwarfs than magnetic ﬁelds.
In this case, Eq. 16 may not be valid.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we performed self-consistent and relativistic
numerical calculations of axisymmetric rotating and magne-
tized white dwarf structure by means of a pseudo-spectral
method, where the standard stress-energy tensor of a per-
fect ﬂuid and the electromagnetic ﬁeld were employed. First,
we ﬁxed the baryon stellar mass and we computed the
quadrupole moment of the conﬁguration, which was used
to estimate the gravitational wave amplitudes of potential
sources. In our case, white dwarfs can be rotating and/or
endowed with a poloidal magnetic ﬁeld.

We showed that the moment of inertia of white dwarfs
increase signiﬁcantly due to magnetic ﬁelds and depend
strongly on the stellar mass, where less massive WD’s have
higher moment of inertia, however, since they are less dense,
they reach lower magnetic ﬁelds values than massive stars.
Moreover, we gave bounds for the radius, magnetic ﬁelds,
moment of inertia and quadrupole moment of the pulsar
white dwarf AR Sco. These results relied on the assump-
tion that the observed luminosity corresponds exactly to the
spin-down power undergone by the white dwarf. Although
we have assumed this approximation in this work, we do
not expect qualitative changes in our conclusions, since ac-
cording to Fig. 2 a higher luminosity implies just a smaller
possible mass for AR Sco.

More importantly, we also found that magnetic white
dwarfs might lead to a detectable signal by the DECIGO
and BBO gravitational wave detectors. The DECIGO and
the BBO, both having the same sensitivity frequency band,
perform better than LISA in detecting GW from magnetized
white dwarfs. In addition, we saw that BBO is able to de-
tect GW even from a purely rotating white dwarf (without
magnetic ﬁelds) with MB = 0.50 M⊙ rotating at a frequency of
0.01 Hz, while DECIGO can potentially measure gravitation
radiation from the magnetic counterpart of this star.

A key fact is that the magnetic ﬁeld (for the star
MB = 0.50 M⊙) that corresponds to the minimum GW am-
plitude within the detectable range of DECIGO is close to
observed ones, what indicates that magnetized white dwarfs
are also likely sources of GW and could be detected by fu-
ture space-based gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore,
based on the GW amplitude, magnetic white dwarfs can
emit gravitational radiation so intense as in strongly mag-
netized neutron stars.

It is worth mentioning that the detection of white
dwarfs with higher frequencies (∼ 1 Hz) would make them
better candidates of gravitational wave sources, since they
would lie in the optimal band of DECIDO and BBO inter-
ferometers. Note that, we did not run out of all possible
combinations of masses, rotation and magnetic ﬁeld conﬁg-
urations. However, non-magnetized white dwarfs can reach
(Keplerian limit) frequencies at most ∼ 1.50 Hz, see e.g.
Franzon & Schramm (2015). As a consequence, we have a

natural limit when looking for white dwarfs through gravi-
tational waves emission.

It is well known that simple magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tions with purely poloidal or purely toroidal components are
unlikely to be stable (Tayler 1973; Markey & Tayler 1973;
Flowers & Ruderman 1977; Braithwaite & Nordlund 2006).
Note that the quadrupole distortion induced by toroidal
magnetic ﬁelds would contribute negatively to the total stel-
lar deformation. This is the case because poloidal magnetic
ﬁelds make the stars more oblate, while toroidal ﬁelds make
them more prolate. In this context, an estimate of the stellar
quadrupole distortion assuming both poloidal and toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld components was perfomed by Wentzel (1960);
Ostriker & Gunn (1969). Accordingly, the stellar deforma-
tion could be reduced by 50% when a mixture of poloidal
and toroidal ﬁelds of similar strength are presented in the
star. The distortion of the star scale with its quadrupole
moment as e ∼ Q (Frieben & Rezzolla 2012). Therefore, we
expect that the gravitational wave amplitude, which scale
with Q as h0 ∼ Q, should be only roughly reduced by a fac-
tor of 2 compared to those obtained in this work. In addition,
magnetized stars seem to carry an external dipole magnetic
ﬁeld as the one modeled in this work. Furthermore, even as-
suming for simplicity purely poloidal ﬁelds, we can have a
fair idea of the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength that can
be reached inside these stars and also understand the eﬀects
of strong magnetic ﬁelds both on the GW emission and on
global structure of white dwarfs.

In the future, we are going to include eﬀects due to
microphysics in our calculations as, for example, a more re-
alistic equation of state which includes electron-ion interac-
tions. Moreover, although we do not expect that our ﬁndings
are going to change qualitatively, diﬀerent particle compo-
sition of the star might lead to diﬀerent gravitational wave
amplitudes.
