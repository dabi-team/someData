Abstract. The origins of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (E (cid:38) 1019 eV) are a mystery and still
under debate in astroparticle physics. In recent years some eﬀorts were made to understand their
nature. In this contribution we consider the possibility of Some Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs)
and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) beeing white dwarf pulsars, and show that these sources
can achieve large electromagnetic potentials on their surface that accelerate particle almost at
the speed of light, with energies E ∼ 1020−21 eV. The sources SGRs/AXPs considered as highly
magnetized white dwarfs are well described in the Hillas diagram, lying close to the AR Sorpii
and AE Aquarii which are understood as white dwarf pulsars.

1. Introduction
In our previous work we have raised some issues concerning the origin of ultra-high-cosmic
rays (UHECR) [1]. We pointed out that some soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous
X-ray pulsars (AXPs) could be considered white dwarf pulsars. The idea of SGRs/AXPs as
possible sources of the highest energy cosmic rays was investigated by Arons [2], that have
considered these sources as neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic ﬁeld (B ∼ 1015 G) on their
surface, the so-called magnetars. Rotation and strong magnetic ﬁelds can induce large potential
diﬀerences [3, 4] on the star’s surface, accelerating particles with high energy and fulﬁlling the
magnetosphere with pairs of electron and positrons, which turns into a cascade of photons. More
recently Kashiyama et al. [5] have done an important work in this perspective, suggesting that
the excess of cosmic ray electron and positrons observed in PAMELA is produced in magnetized
White Dwarfs (WDs), by the same mechanism as the one of neutron star pulsars.

In fact, highly magnetized white dwarfs are able to have a large electric ﬁeld on their surface.
Recently, a great number of massive and magnetic white dwarfs (106-109 G) have been observed
[6], and in 2016 a white dwarf pulsar known as AR Scorpii has been discovered with some
minutes of period, showing radiation in a broad range of frequencies [7, 8]. Thus, these fast and
magnetized WDs can be in principle a potential source for ultra-high-energy-cosmic rays, and
in this contribution we will investigate this possibility.

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. The sources
SGRs/AXPs are typically identiﬁed with very slow rotating pulsars P ∼ (2 − 12) s, with intense
magnetic ﬁelds ∼ 1015 G [9]. Their spin-down rates ˙P ∼ (10−13 − 10−10) s/s are larger than
the ones of normal pulsars ˙P ∼ (10−15 − 10−14) s/s [10]. The magnetar’s X-ray luminosity
LX is explained by the decay of their enormous magnetic ﬁeld. These sources do not can be
understood as rotation powered neutron stars, because their rotational energy is much smaller
than X-ray luminosity. Currently there are 23 SGRs/AXPs1 that are classiﬁed as magnetars
and 6 until now only candidates [11].

2.1. SGRs/AXPs as white dwarf pulsars
It has been proposed by Malheiro, Rueda and Ruﬃni an alternative model considering
SGRs/AXPs as white dwarf pulsars [12]. As discussed in [13], the process of release energy
for dipole radiation in a white dwarf can be explained in terms of a canonical spin-powered
pulsars model, since in certain aspects they are similar (see e.g., [14, 15, 16]).
For example, if we consider a star with M = 1.4M(cid:12) and R = 106 cm, the magnetic ﬁeld at poles
is given by,

BNS

p = 3.2 × 1019(P ˙P )1/2G.

(1)

In the case of a white dwarf with M = 1.4M(cid:12) and R = 3 × 108 cm, there is a new scale for the
magnetic ﬁeld at poles,

BWD

p = 4.21 × 1014(P ˙P )1/2G.

(2)

Following the last consideration there are new values for the mass density, moment of inertia,
dipole moment and rotation energy [16, 17]. This description is supported by the observational
growth of fast, massive and highly magnetized WDs [6, 18, 19, 20].

2.2. White dwarf pulsars
This description was raised by Ostriker [21, 22]. Later, the seminal works of Usov [23, 24]
have discussed the generation of gamma rays by magnetic white dwarfs, showing that WD can
produce pairs of electron-positron e±. Zhang and Gil [25] interpreted the transient radio source,
GCRT J1745-3009, as a white dwarf pulsar with a period of 77.13 minutes. In this situation the
production of e± due curvature radiation is below of the pair-production threshold, still if the
star is assumed with a ﬁeld BWD
p = 109 G. We highlight the recent discovery, AR Scorpii (AR
Sco’s), as a pulsating white dwarf in a binary system conﬁrming the hypothesis of white dwarf
pulsar [7]. AR Sco’s has a range of mass 0.81M(cid:12) < M 1 < 1.29M(cid:12) and pulses with a period of
1.97 minutes. These pulses reﬂect the spin of a WD, slowing down on a 107 yr timescale. The
AR Sco’s broadband spectrum is characteristic of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic
electrons, possibly originate from near the white dwarf and accelerated to almost the speed of
light. These particles produce radiation from X-ray to radio wavelengths, typically of neutron
star pulsars. This rapidly rotating magnetized WD would simulate the neutron star pulsars as
pointed out by Geng et al. [26]. Another speciﬁc example is AE Aquarii, the ﬁrst white dwarf
pulsar, with a short period P = 33 s and spinning down at a rate ˙P = 5.64 × 10−14 s/s. The
rapid braking of the white dwarf and the nature of hard X-ray pulses detected with SUZAKU
space telescope [27] can be explained in terms of spin-powered pulsar mechanism [28]. Although
AE Aquarii is a binary system with orbital period 9.88 hr, pretty likely the matters’ accretion
is inhibited by the fast rotation of the white dwarf.

3. General constrains from geometry and radiation to UHECR
There are some constrains that UHECR particles should satisfy, as shown by [29]:

• geometry - the accelerated particle should need be kept inside the source while being

accelerated;

• power - the source should posses the required amount of energy to give it to accelerated

particles;

• radiation losses - the energy lost by a particle for radiation in the accelerating ﬁeld should

not exceed the energy gain;

• interaction losses - the energy lost by a particle in interactions with other particles should

not exceed the energy gain;

• emissivity - the total number (density) and power of sources should be able to provide the

observed UHECR ﬂux;

• accompanying radiation of photons, neutrinos and low-energy cosmic rays should not exceed

the observed ﬂuxes, both for a given source and for the diﬀuse background.

4. Hillas criterion
If a particle escapes from the region where it was being accelerated, it will not be unable to
gain more energy. The one in question establish a limit on maximum energy Emax acquired by
a particle passing in a medium with magnetic ﬁeld B,

Emax = ZqBRs,

(3)

where q is the electric charge of the particle, B is the magnetic ﬁeld, Rs is the size of the
accelerator and Z the atomic number of the particle (for the case of iron, Z = 26). This
equation considers the Larmour radius of the particle, RL = Emax/(ZqB) (cid:54) Rs. This is a
general geometrical criterion known as the Hillas criterion for all types of cosmic ray sources [30].
Neglecting energy losses, i.e., the accelerator is 100% eﬃcient, we see that only the parameters
Rs and B can describe the source, showing a relationship between the sources’ magnetic ﬁeld
strength and its size.

5. Particle acceleration
As we discussed above, there are a great number of magnetic white dwarfs and according
Usov [24] if the surface temperature is less than 104 K (see [31], for the thermal emission in
fast rotating, highly magnetized white dwarfs), a scale height of its atmosphere is essentially
smaller than the radius of white dwarf R and the WD will have a strong electric ﬁeld E in its
magnetosphere,

E(cid:107) = (cid:126)E · (cid:126)B/| (cid:126)B| (cid:54)= 0.
This parallel electric ﬁeld determines a charge distribution, known as Goldreich-Julian charge
density [32],

(4)

ρc =

4π

2πc

(cid:126)∇ · (cid:126)E = −

(cid:126)Ω · (cid:126)B.

(5)

Particles in that charge distribution co-rotate with the star until the distance where the linear
velocity reaches the speed of light. This region is commonly known as light cylinder, with a
radius Rl = c/Ω. Near the surface of the star, the intense electric ﬁeld tear away particles. Ultra
relativistic particles ﬂowing out, move along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines producing curvature
radiation,

Eγ =

where

rc ∼ (Rc/Ω)1/2

(7)

is the curvature radius of the ﬁeld lines. The perpendicular energy of the particle is rapidly
dissipated by synchrotron radiation. This curvature radiation interact with the magnetic ﬁeld
and produce secondary e± pairs, γ + B → e− + e+, leading to a pair creation avalanche. The
value of the Lorentz γ factor of the e± pairs produced, is given by the potential diﬀerence in the
polar cap region,

γ =

e∆V
mc2 .

(8)

Neutron star pulsars are able to produce electrons with Lorentz factors γ (cid:38) 107. There is a gap
h above the polar region, and the potential diﬀerence becomes [33]

where h is given by

6. Discussions
Using the dipole formula given in Ref.
[34] to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld, we have shown
that the magnetic ﬁelds for SGRs/AXPs as highly magnetized white dwarf are at the order of
[17, 35, 36, 37, 38],

p ∼ 109G.
This allows us to estimate the charge density in the magnetosphere, i.e., the Goldreich-Julian
density given by equation 5,

BWD

(11)

c ∼ 10−2cm−3,
ρWD
this value is 105 smaller than the ones when SGRs/AXPs are considered as neutron stars, which
have a magnetic ﬁeld B ∼ 1014−15 G. Thus, in the magnetosphere of SGRs/AXPs being white
dwarfs, there are less charged particles than the neutron stars ones.

(12)

From equation 9, we can calculate the maximum potential diﬀerence achieved on the surface

of SGRs/AXPs as white dwarfs, using Ω ∼ 1 Hz, R ∼ 3 × 103 km,

∆V ∼ 1016V.

(13)

This diﬀerence is achieved in a length of h ∼ 103 cm, and allows the particles accelerated to
reach ultra relativistic energies, larger than that of neutron star pulsars. Therefore, white dwarfs
can accelerate electrons with Lorentz factors at least γ ∼ 1010, one thousand times larger than
those accelerated by neutron star pulsars, being capable to produce curvature photons with an
energy up to ∼ 1021 eV.

Figure 1 show the Hillas plot for a maximum energy of Emax = 1020−21 eV for protons and
Emax = 1020−21 eV for iron. The sources above the green and black lines are able to accelerate
atoms of iron up to 1020 eV and 1021 eV, respectively. Similarly, the sources above the blue and
orange lines are able to accelerate protons up to 1020 eV and 1021 eV, respectively. This ﬁgure
shows that SGRs/AXPs described as WDs and the two known white dwarf pulsars are all on
the line of the Hillas plot obtained by Hillas criterion, and consistent with all the others cosmic
ray sources known in the universe. Moreover, SGRs/AXPs as magnetars (neutron star pulsars)
are out and much above this line, which is not the case for ordinary neutron star pulsars as

Figure 1. Hillas plot showing the magnetic ﬁeld strength versus size of SGRs/AXPs as NSs
(magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 1013−15 G and radius of 106 cm) and WDs (magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 108−10 G and
radius of 3×108 cm). The blue-stars and magenta-diamonds describe the SGRs/AXPs as neutron
stars and white dwarfs, respectively. Here, we are considering these cosmic ray sources for a
maximum energy of Emax = 1020−21 eV for protons (blue and orange lines) and Emax = 1020−21
eV for iron (green and black lines). The cyan-square and black-triangles represent AR Scorpius
with magnetic ﬁeld of ≈ 9 × 108 G and radius of 7 × 108 cm, and AE Aquarii with magnetic ﬁeld
of ≈ 1.5 × 108 G and radius of 6.5 × 108 cm, respectively. As we see these two sources are able to
accelerate ultra-high energy cosmic rays. It’s worth mentioning other possible sources of cosmic
rays pointed in the literature: the yellow-circle, red-pentagon and blue-hexagon are the known
radio pulsars, gamma rays-bursts (GRBs) and active Galaxy nuclei (AGNs), respectively.

we also show in Figure 1. Thus, it is quite important to obtain precision measurements of the
radius and surface magnetic ﬁeld of SGRs/AXPs with the new telescopes.

The interaction losses are minimum in the stars’ magnetosphere, considering the photon is
emitted in a cone with an angular aperture 1/γ and there is a low charged particle density.
Among all SGRs/AXPs, CXOU J010043.1 is the most distant source, located ∼ 62.4 kpc,
thus all sources are within the GZK limit, which is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of
cosmic rays coming from outside of our Galaxy (≈ 10 Mpc for protons with energy of 1019
eV) [39, 40]. Particles accelerated in these sources could be a fraction of ultra-high cosmic ray

All these ﬁndings support the plausibility of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays from SGRs/AXPs (fast and magnetic massive white dwarfs), in line with important and
recent astronomical observations of white dwarf pulsars. We encourage future observational
campaigns to verify the radius and the magnetic ﬁeld of these sources.
