The experiment of Ar+Au reactions at 30 MeV/u have been performed using the Compact Spec-
trometer for Heavy IoN Experiments (CSHINE) in phase I. The light-charged particles are measured
by the silicon stripe telescopes in coincidence with the ﬁssion fragments recorded by the parallel
plate avalanche counters. The distribution properties of the azimuth diﬀerence ∆φ and the time-
of-ﬂight diﬀerence ∆T OF of the ﬁssion fragments are presented varying the folding angles which
represents the linear momentum transfer from the projectile to the reaction system. The relative
abundance of the light charged particles in the ﬁssion events to the inclusive events is compared as
a function of the laboratory angle θlab ranging from 18◦ to 60◦ in various folding angle windows.
The angular evolution of the yield ratios of p/d and t/d in coincidence with ﬁssion fragments is
investigated. In a relative comparison, tritons are more abundantly emitted at small angles, while
protons are more abundant at large angles. The angular evolution of the neutron richness of the
light-charged particles is consistent with the results obtained in previous inclusive experiments.

INTRODUCTION

cleon mass, etc[16].

Nuclear ﬁssion is a large-amplitude collective motion
mode involving up to hundreds of nucleons. Recently the
studies on nuclear ﬁssion have been revived for its sig-
niﬁcance in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. For
instance, the competition brought by ﬁssion reduces the
possibility of the formation of superheavy elements [1]. In
the stellar environment, the abundance of the nuclides in
A ≈ 160 region is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the recycling
of the ﬁssion products [2–4]. Theoretically, statistical ﬁs-
sion has been described well by microscopical theories
and various phenomenological approaches [5–13]. Tak-
ing a few recent studies, for example, by computing the
potential energy surface in the macroscopic-microscopic
model with the Lublin-Strasbourg Drop (LSD) for the
macroscopic part and the Yukawa-folded potential for
the microscopic energy corrections, the ﬁssion fragment
mass distributions are predicted in a broad mass region
ranging from Thorium to the most superheavy elements,
showing rather good consistency with the data if avail-
able [14, 15]. Using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
approach, the reactions 238U+40Ca near the Coulomb
barrier have been investigated in terms of the inﬂuences
of various ingredients in eﬀective nuclear interaction, in-
cluding incompressibility, symmetry energy, eﬀective nu-

When the excitation energy or the angular momentum
becomes much high, as achieved in heavy-ion reactions
well above the Coulomb barrier, the ﬁssion barrier tends
to vanish. As a consequence, the ﬁssion life-time becomes
shorter by a factor of 10 to 100 and the variance of the
mass asymmetry increases signiﬁcantly (the mass asym-
metry η of the two fragments can be larger than 0.6),
compared to the statistical ﬁssion [17–21]. In addition,
the friction grows with the increasing of nuclear temper-
ature and the diﬀusion enhance the ﬁssion probability
[22–24]. So the process of fast ﬁssion is more compli-
cated and the dynamic feature of the ﬁssion process is
of signiﬁcance. Usually the transport models have been
successfully applied to describe the mass and total kinetic
energy distributions and the time scale of the ﬁssion [25–
34]. Time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory can give an
excellent qualitative and quantitative description of fast
ﬁssion starting with large deformation[35].

With the advent of advanced 4π detectors for heavy-
ion reactions at Fermi energies,
fast ﬁssion, usually
termed as dynamic ﬁssion because of its vanishing ﬁssion
barrier and short time scale, has recently been investi-
gated in various systems [36–39, 42]. In various reactions
from 25 to 50 MeV/u, the angular distribution of the ﬁs-
sion axis w.r.t. the separation direction of projectile-like

 
 
 
 
 
 
fragments (PLF) against the target-like fragments (TLF)
exhibits an alignment enhancement at very forward an-
gles [36]. Similarly, forward-backward asymmetry in the
angular distribution has been observed for the dynamic
ﬁssion events in 80Kr +48 Ca at 35 MeV/u using part of
FAZIA setup [39, 40] and in 124Sn +64 Ni at 35 MeV/u
using CHIMERA setup [37, 41]. Besides, the isospin con-
tent of the emitted IMFs in the dynamic breakup of PLF
shows a slight evolution as a function of the rotating an-
gle of the ﬁssioning PLF [39]. The short time scale of the
dynamic ﬁssion is also demonstrated by analysis of the
correlation functions of IMF-IMF pairs [42].

The topic of fast ﬁssion with the simultaneous emission
of the particles deserves further investigations because
the ﬁssioning system provides an appropriate laboratory
to probe the density behavior of nuclear symmetry en-
ergy, which is of great interest in both nuclear physics
and astrophysics [43], particularly after the discovery of
the neutron star merging event GW170817. According
to transport model simulations on Ar + Au reactions, the
occurrence of fast ﬁssion of the heavy target-like fragment
(TLF) enhances the emission of the coalescence-invariant
neutrons (CIN) in comparison to that in the events with-
out ﬁssion[44]. Such enhancement can be associated with
the presence of neck emission as shown experimentally
[38, 45]. Due to the enriched emission of neutrons, ei-
ther free or bounded in clusters, and to the accumula-
tion of the isospin eﬀect in the long-time process, the rel-
ative neutron richness of the emitted particles provides
an eﬀective probe to the symmetry energy. The experi-
mental attempt to extract the nuclear symmetry energy
parameter has been reported in inverse kinetic reactions
124Sn +64 Ni, where the dynamic ﬁssion of the heavy PLF
has been experimentally investigated by measuring the
three bodies coincidence.
It has been found that the
intermediate-mass fragments emitted from the neck re-
gion are more neutron-rich. Comparison to stochastic
mean-ﬁeld (SMF) simulations favors symmetry energy
with the slope parameter L ≈ 80 MeV [38]. Later in
Ar + Au reactions at 30 MeV/u, the angular evolution
of the neutron excess of the emitted light charged parti-
cles (LCPs) has been used to probe the symmetry energy,
yielding a softer symmetry energy L ≈ 47 ± 14 MeV at
95% conﬁdential level [46].

In this paper, we present the experimental results of
the fast ﬁssion following Ar+Au reactions at 30 MeV/u
using the Compact Spectrometer for Heavy Ion Experi-
ment (CSHINE) [47, 48]. The kinetic properties of the
ﬁssion fragments have been investigated, and the coinci-
dent light charged particles (LCPs) at midrapidity have
been measured. The angular evolution of the neutron
richness of the LCPs is discussed in diﬀerent linear mo-
mentum transfer windows. The article is arranged as
follows: Section II presents the experimental setup and
the detector performance, Section III introduces the data
analysis method on the ﬁssion events. The main results
are presented in Section IV, and Section V is the sum-
mary.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND DETECTOR
PERFORMANCE

The experiment was carried out on the Compact Spec-
trometer for Heavy IoN Experiments (CSHINE) installed
in the large chamber at the ﬁnal focal plane of the Ra-
dioactive Ion Beam Line I in Lanzhou (RIBLL1), China.
The gold target with a thickness of 1 mg/cm2 was bom-
barded by the 30 MeV/u 40Ar beam delivered by the
Heavy Ion Research Facility (HIRFL). The beam inten-
sity was about 6 nA.

The CSHINE with complete conﬁguration consists of
six silicon strip detector (SSD) telescopes and three par-
allel plate avalanche counters (PPACs) for measuring the
light charged particles and the ﬁssion fragments (FFs),
respectively [47].
In phase I, two SSD telescopes and
three PPACs were mounted for the beam experiment, as
shown in Fig. 1. The PPACs with an active area of
240 × 280 mm2 were installed at the distance of 427.5
mm to the target, delivering the position and timing in-
formation of the FFs. The PPACs were operated with
4.5 mbar isobutane at 465 V so that the LCPs and
intermediate-mass fragments (IMFs) were suppressed.
The main PPAC is concentrated at θlab = 50◦ and the
other two PPACs are placed on the other side of the
beam at θlab = 40◦ and 95◦, respectively. Each SSD tele-
scope consists of two layers of SSDs for energy loss (∆E)
measurement and one layer of CsI hodoscope with 3 × 3
units read out by photodiodes (PD) for residual energy
ECsI measurement. The ﬁrst layer of SSD is a 32-strip
one-dimensional detector with a thickness of 65 µm. The
second layer, 1500 µm in thickness, is a two-dimensional
detector with 32 strips on both sides. The strips are
all 1.9 mm wide, and the inter-strip distance is 0.1 mm.
The geometry coverage of the PPACs and the SSD tele-
scopes in the laboratory reference is presented in Fig. 2.
It is shown that the angular range of θlab = 18◦ − 60◦
is partially covered for the measurement of the charged
particles. In addition, three small silicon telescopes con-
sisting of two Si (Au) barrier detectors and a CsI unit are
placed at large angles to measure the evaporation LCPs.
The geometric parameters, including the distance from
the center of each detector to the target d, the polar an-
gle θ, the azimuth angle φ, and the sensitive area S of
the detectors of CSHINE components are listed in Table
1.

PPAC is a multi-wire chamber working in a region of
limited proportionality. The signals induced by the inci-
dent fragments on an individual wire of the anode plane,
either X or Y, are transferred through a delay line to both
ends. The time delay of the two signals X1 and X2 (Y1
and Y2) with respect to the signal collected on the cath-
ode plane, which delivers the timing information, gives
the X (Y) position of the hit in the sensitive area. Fig.
3 (b) shows a two-dimensional histogram of Y1 − Y2 vs
X1 − X2 for PPAC1 as an example. The projections to
X and Y direction are plotted in Fig. 3 (a) and (c), re-
spectively. A good performance in timing, corresponding

olution of σr = 1.35 mm can be derived from the data.
The mechanical structure and the overall performance of
the PPACs can be found in [50].

Panel (b) is a two-dimensional distribution of Y1 − Y2 versus
X1 − X2 . The projection to X1-X2 and Y1-Y2 dimensions
are shown in panel (a) and (c), respectively.

The SSD telescopes are advantageous for their high
granularity and high energy resolution. Owing the 2 mm
width strip, one obtains the angular resolution better
than 1◦ at the current geometrical positions. The ∆E1
and ∆E2 silicon strip detectors are calibrated using the
precise pulse generator and the 239Pu α source. After
the SSD calibration is done, the CsI hodoscope can be
calibrated for each individual isotope from ∆E2 − ECsI
scattering plot, where the energy deposit in CsI can be
calculated using LISE++ package [49]. The total en-
ergy resolution of the SSD telescopes is about 2% eval-
uated by the Monte-Carlo simulation studies reproduc-
ing the trend and the width of all isotope bands on the
∆E2 − ECsI plot [47]. The performance of the SSD tele-
scopes in CSHINE is summarized in Fig. 4. Panel (a)
presents the ∆E2-ECsI scattering plot of one CsI unit in
the SSD telescope 2 as an example. It is shown that the
isotopes of hydrogen and helium are clearly identiﬁed.
From the width of each band, the mass resolution of the
LCPs, ∆M/M = 1, is estimated. Since the high voltage
for the ﬁrst layer of the SSD telescopes failed for most
of the time in the experiment and caused poor particle
identiﬁcation on ∆E1 − ∆E2 plots, only the high-energy
LCPs penetrating through ∆E2 SSD were analyzed in
current studies. Fig. 4 (b) presents the energy spectra
of p, d, t, 3He, and 4He in coincidence with the FFs,
respectively. See Ref. [47] for the structural framework,
performance, and detailed analysis of the SSD telescopes.
In addition to the inclusive trigger for all detectors,
three types of coincident trigger signals are constructed
in this experiment.
i) The two-ﬁssion-fragment event
in the PPACs, ii) The two-body LCP event in the SSD
telescopes, and iii) One LCP coincided with two FFs in
PPACs. For the measurement of two FFs, while PPAC1
is served as the primary FF detector, PPAC2 or PPAC3
on the other side of the beamline provides the coincident

to good position resolution, manifests itself in the sharp
boundary for the two-dimensional distribution and the
well-separated individual peaks on the projections. The
distance of the neighboring wires is 4 mm, and there are
61 peaks and 71 peaks in Fig. 3 (a) and (c), respectively.

In the 120-hour beam experiment, the inclusive event
of at least one LCP is about 1.6 × 107 after applying a
fraction divide factor 50, the event of two ﬁssion frag-
ments is about 5 × 106, and for the event of two ﬁssion
fragments plus one light charged particle, the statistics
is about 3.64 × 105.

III. DATA ANALYSIS METHOD

In the picture of incomplete fusion, a heavy target-like
fragment (TLF) is formed by the fusion of part of the
projectile and the target nuclei. The fraction of the to-
tal momentum of the projectile transferred to the TLF
is called linear momentum transfer (LMT). With a cer-
tain probability depending on the system’s total angular
momentum, the TLF may undergo ﬁssion or fast ﬁssion
in competition with the emission residue channel. For
the ﬁssion events, Fig. 5 presents the kinetic geometry
of the TLF ﬁssion event. As shown, the origin point O is
the target nuclei in the laboratory system, the vector OO
represents the direction of the beam. The velocity vectors

In the experiment, the position and energy informa-
tion of the LCPs can be measured accurately. For the
ﬁssion fragments, however, because the start timing of
the reaction can not be measured with suﬃcient preci-
sion, the absolute time-of-ﬂight (TOF) is not available.
Only the diﬀerence of TOF between the two ﬁssion frag-
ments can be derived with sub-nanosecond timing resolu-
tion for each detector, which reaches 300 ps in the source
test [50]. Besides, the direction of the velocity vectors can
be precisely determined by the hit positions recorded by
the PPACs.

to assure
events recorded by PPAC1 with PPAC2 (marked by
PPAC1 × 2) or with PPAC3 (marked by PPAC1 × 3) are
the ﬁssion fragments (marked by FF-FF) since the two-
body correlation is possibly contaminated by the correla-
tion of the PLF with TLF (PLF-TLF) or the correlation
of the PLF with one of the ﬁssion fragments from the
TLF (PLF-FF). First, the high voltage is set that the
response of PPAC to PLF is highly suppressed, given
that the energy loss of PLF is lower than FFs by more
than one order of magnitude. Second, the geometric cov-
erage of the PPACs is out of the angular range of the
PLF. In order to verify this point, we check the angular
correlation of the two fragments in comparison with the
prediction of the improved quantum molecular dynamics
(ImQMD) transport model calculations. The details of
the ImQMD model can be found in [44]. Fig. 6 presents
the experimental correlation between the polar angles of
the two fragments on the scattering plot of |θ1 − θ2| vs
θ1 + θ2 . It is shown that the events of PPAC1 × 2 are
well separated from those of PPAC1 × 3. For compari-
son, the results of transport model simulations are dis-
played in Fig. 7 (a-c) in the form of |θ1 −θ2| as a function

reactions (b = 4 − 10 fm) are accumulated according to
the corresponding weights. The experimental coverage
of PPAC1 × 2 and PPAC1 × 3 are indicated by the red
and green dashed polygons. Panels (a), (b), and (c) rep-
resent the PLF-TLF, PLF-FF, and FF-FF correlations in
ImQMD simulations, respectively. It is shown that the
angular correlation of the PLF-TLF events is mostly out
of the experimental coverage. For the reactions undergo-
ing ﬁssion, the PLF-FF correlations are partially covered
by the PPAC1 and PPAC2 with a tiny portion, as in-
dicated by the marked area’s colorful contour compared
with the most populated area in panel (b). It indicates
that the coincident events of two heavy fragments are
dominated by the FF-FF events, as conﬁrmed in panel
(c).

Clearly, given the relative velocity ∆v12 of the FFs, the
folding angle depends on the velocity of the TLF vtl, i.e.,
the larger vtl, the smaller ΘFF. Fig. 8 presents the dis-
tribution of the folding angle ΘFF. The coincident events
of PPAC1 × 2 distribute in the range between 60◦ −120◦
with the peak situating at about 90◦, corresponding to
a larger LMT (red), while the PPAC1 × 3 events sit in
the range of 110◦ − 170◦ corresponds to a smaller LMT
(blue). The valley between the two histograms is due
to the deﬁciency caused by the gap between PPAC2 and
PPAC3.

|θ1 − θ2| vs. θ1 + θ2 of two ﬁssion fragments marked by sub-

θ1 +θ2 of two ﬁssion fragments in ImQMD calculations. Panel
(a-c) presents the results for PLF-TLF events, PLF-FF events
and FF-FF events, respectively. The polygons in the panels
indicate the experimental coverage.

Once the events with two FFs are identiﬁed, the fold-
ing angle method has been used to measure the LMT of
the reaction. As shown in Fig. 5, the folding angle ΘFF
is deﬁned as the angle (cid:54) AOC, spanned by the projection
of the velocity vectors of the FFs on the projection plane.

FIG. 8: The folding angle distribution of two-body ﬁs-
sion events. The red histogram represents the events of
PPAC1 × 2 and the blue histogram represents the PPAC1 × 3
events.

One can further check the energy spectra of LCP from
the statistic emission in the two groups of events to make
sure the experimental folding angle is a measure of the
LMT. Model independently, a larger LMT causes higher
excitation energy of the TLF, for which a larger slope
temperature parameter of the emission LCP can be ex-
pected. To check this scenario, one can simply survey the
energy spectra of evaporation particles at very large an-
gles, where only the evaporation source dominates. Fig-
ure 9 presents the energy spectra of protons recorded in
the small Si3 installed at θlab = 130◦ in coincidence with
PPAC1 × 2 (red) and PPAC1 × 3 (blue) ﬁssion events.
Because of the low statistics, ﬁner division of the ΘFF
is not achievable. The descents of the energy spectra
are ﬁtted by a logarithmic function Y = a exp (−E/Tsl)
without taking into account the kinetic energy diﬀerence
and the Coulomb barrier diﬀerence of these two groups
of event, which mainly inﬂuence the peak of the spectra.
The slope parameter Tsl = 6.2 ± 0.2 and 5.3 ± 0.2 MeV
are deduced from the ﬁtting for the two groups of events,
respectively. Evidently, the slope parameter is larger in
the group of PPAC1 × 2 events than that in PPAC1 × 3.
It is consistent with the picture that the folding angle of
the FFs reﬂects the LMT of the reaction. Namely, with
a smaller folding angle, or larger LMT, the TLF formed
in the incomplete fusion gains higher excitation energy.
In order to reconstruct the complete kinetics of the
ﬁssion of TLF, one has to measure the velocity vectors
It requires to measure both the time
of the two FFs.

With equations (1 − 3), one can readily reconstruct the
velocity of the two FFs numerically. If only the fragments
following the ﬁssion of TLF are recorded, the distribution
of both velocities will exhibit a one-component feature.
Fig. 10 presents the correlation of the velocity vf1 and
vf2 of the two FFs in laboratory for the PPAC1 × 2 ﬁs-
sion events. Panels (a-e) represents the correlations in
ﬁve windows of the folding angle ΘFF = 75◦ − 85◦, 85◦ −
95◦, 95◦−105◦, 105◦−115◦ and 115◦−125◦, respectively.
Panel (f) is the sum of all the events. Except for the low-
est ΘFF = 75◦ − 85◦ window, where two components are
seemingly presented indicating that they are originating
from diﬀerent sources, the anti-correlation is well visible
in all other windows, and the kinetic feature of the two
FFs exhibits insigniﬁcant diﬀerence. The velocity corre-
lation for the PPAC1 × 3 ﬁssion events, which are not
presented here, does not show a two-component feature.

and the distance of ﬂight of the FFs. However, the start
timing signal, which is supposed to be delivered by the
cyclotron’s radio frequency (RF) signal, was not available
in the experiment. Thus, to obtain the velocity, one relies
on the Viola’s systematics describing the velocity of the
FFs in the center of mass reference of the ﬁssioning nu-
cleus. For symmetric ﬁssion, the kinetic energy of ﬁssion
fragments is mainly supplied by the Coulomb energy at
the scission point, and the most probable velocity of each
FF is 1.2 cm/ns [51]. For the fast ﬁssion that occurred in
heavy-ion reactions at Fermi energies, recent simulations
with the ImQMD model verify that the distribution of
the relative velocity of the FFs is indeed peaked in the
vicinity of 2.4 cm/ns with a broadening less than 10%.
It shows insigniﬁcant dependence on the mass asymme-
try of the FFs [34]. Here we neglect the inﬂuence of
highly-aligned events with the ﬁssion axis sitting in par-
allel with the ﬂying direction of the TLF. These highly-
aligned events, in which the relative velocity may violate
the assumption as observed at higher beam energy[36],
are anyway out of the geometrical reach in the current
experimental setup. Following the Viola systematics, we
ﬁrst assume that relative velocity between the two FFs
is ﬁxed at 2.4 cm/ns. Under this assumption, applying
cosine theorem to the velocity vector triangle ∆OAB as
shown in Fig. 5, one writes

(a) presents the velocity vf1 of the FF in PPAC1, while
panel (b) is the velocity vf2 of the fragment measured in
PPAC2 (red) or PPAC3 (blue), respectively. For vf1, the
broadening of the distribution is 0.5 − 2.5 cm/ns in cen-
tral reactions, larger than the range 0.8 − 2 cm/ns as in
peripheral reactions. Very similarly, the width of vf2 is
larger in PPAC2 than that in PPAC3 because the former
(later) corresponds to central (peripheral) reactions, re-
spectively. It is as expected that the excitation energy of
the TLF is higher in the event group of PPAC1 × 2 cor-
responding to larger LMT, for which a wider distribution
of the velocity of the FFs is observed. In peripheral re-
actions,in addition, a part of the LMT is converted into
exciting the collective rotation of the TLF. Detailed anal-
ysis on the variance of the velocity will be discussed in
the next section.

tral (red) and peripheral (blue) reactions. Panel (a) presents
vf1 recorded in PPAC1 and panel (b) presents vf2 recorded
in PPAC2 (red) or PPAC3 (blue).

As long as the velocities of the FFs are reconstructed
using the Viola systematics, the velocity of the TLF in
the center of mass frame can be calculated if the mass
ratio of the two FFs is known. However, the momentum
conservation criteria is already used in equation (2), in
order to calculate the vtl and further LMT, one can ﬁx the
direction of (cid:126)vtl by relying on the second assumption that
the TLF undergoes symmetric ﬁssion. Fig. 12 presents
the velocity of the TLF (left) and the LMT (right), re-
spectively. Again, the red and blue curves represent the
central and peripheral reactions, where the LMT distri-
bution peaks at LMT = 0.81 and 0.27, respectively. Fig.
13 presents the correlation between the LMT and the
folding angle ΘFF. It is evident that these two quantities
are reversely correlated, i.e., the LMT decreases with in-
creasing the folding angle. This correlation exists as a
general feature without relying on the symmetric ﬁssion
assumption, although the details of the correlations may
change if this assumption is released. Nevertheless, to
minimize the eﬀect of the symmetric ﬁssion assumption,
we will use the folding angle as a measurement of the
reaction violence in the following discussions.

Finally, to eliminate the inﬂuence of the events lo-
cated at each quantity’s outer border, we impose four
loose cut conditions on the experimental data.

the planarity of the ﬁssion events. Recalling Fig 5, it
can be comprehended that the (cid:54) BOC reﬂects the devia-
tion of the projection plane from the ﬁssion plane, while
the (cid:54) DOO
denotes how much the (cid:126)vtl deviates from the
beam. If the ﬁssion of the rotating TLF occurs ideally
in the reaction plane without being recoiled by particle
emission, the two angles are zero. Fig. 14 presents the

narity is kept well. We set two cuts as (cid:54) BOC < 20◦ and
< 20◦, which help to remove some multi-body
(cid:54) DOO
events with the emission of undetected massive fragments
causing the degradation of the planarity of the two-body
ﬁssion process. Table II summarizes the cut conditions

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Fission Distributions

To view the ﬁssion distribution properties, we start
with the azimuth correlation of the two FFs. Fig. 15
presents the correlation between the azimuthal angle dif-
ference ∆φ and the folding angle ΘFF. It is clearly shown
that for the FFs from both the central and peripheral re-

PPAC1 × 3 (blue) ﬁssion events. It is shown that σ(∆φ)
decreases with the folding angle in the whole range. To
exclude the possible reason that this trend originates
from the asymmetry of the geometrical locations of the
PPACs, we restrict further the analysis on the events
with the two FFs ﬂying symmetrically to the beam di-
rection, i.e., with the condition of θ1 = θ2, where θi is
the polar angle of the ith fragment. The result is de-
picted by the black squares, where the bin width of each
ΘFF is ±3◦. This condition is applicable only for the
PPAC1 × 2 ﬁssion events because these two PPACs are
placed in approximate left-right symmetry with respect
to the beamline. It is shown clearly that σ(∆φ) decreases
with the folding angle in the same manner with the only
exceptional point on the very edge of the PPAC2. It is
concluded that the decreasing trend of σ(∆φ) as func-
tion of ΘFF is truly due to the reaction violence. Since
the post-scission particle emission changes the velocity
of the FF due recoil eﬀect, the trend suggests that in
the ﬁssion following the intermediate energy heavy-ion
reactions, there is suﬃcient excitation energy left at the
scission point depending on LMT. In the reactions with
larger LMT, more excitation energy is left and released
through the particle emission in the post-scission stage.
It is consistent with the picture of fast ﬁssion, instead of
statistic ﬁssion in which the excitation energy is nearly
depleted at the scission point.

actions, the most probable value situates at ∆φ = 180◦
following the picture that the system undergoes a binary
decay. Here we note that the ∆φ is a directly measurable
quantity relying on no assumption. In addition, the dis-
tribution of ∆φ exhibits a certain broadening which dep-
nds on the folding angle, what suggests that the emission
of LCP or IMF may change the ﬂight direction of the FF
and smear the back-to-back feature of the ﬁssion event.

diﬀerence as a function of folding angle. The red (blue) sym-
bols represent the PPAC1 × 2 (PPAC1 × 3) events, while the
black symbols represent the events in PPAC1 × 2 with an

geometrically symmetric with θ1 = θ2.

In order to further quantify the variation of the az-
imuthal diﬀerence, the standard deviation σ(∆φ) of ∆φ
is extracted in each ΘFF bin of 10◦. The results are
summarized in Fig. 16 for the PPAC1 × 2 (red) and

Next, we investigate the other directly measurable
quantity in the experiment, the TOF diﬀerence of the two
FFs. In the current scheme with Eq. (2) and the current
geometrical conﬁguration that the central detector-target
distances are the same for three PPACs, the TOF diﬀer-
ence ∆T OF between the FFs originates mainly from the
velocity diﬀerence ∆v of the FFs, which indirectly re-
ﬂects the mass asymmetry of the FFs. From Eq. (2) and

velocity (cid:104)vf (cid:105) is systematically smaller in PPAC3 because
this PPACs is located at a much larger angle and the
velocity of the FF is counteracted mainly by the recoil
TLF which is moving forward in the laboratory frame.
Panel (b) presents the standard deviation of the velocity,
and it is also clear that the broadening of the velocity of
the FFs decreases with the folding angle.

Fig. 17 presents the correlation between ∆T OF and
the folding angle ΘFF. The 1-dimensional distribution of
∆T OF is shown in the inset. Moving from small ΘFF
area to large values, the broadening of ∆T OF decreases,
showing a similar trend as ∆φ.

Fig. 18 further presents the standard deviation of the
∆T OF distribution as a function of folding angle ΘFF
for the PPAC1 × 2 (red) and PPAC1 × 3 (blue) ﬁs-
sion events. Again, to minimize the possible eﬀect of the
variation of geometric conditions, we restrict the analysis
to the events with symmetric geometry, i.e., θ1 = θ2 in
the PPAC1 × 2 ﬁssion events, as depicted by the black
squares in the ﬁgure. With this geometrically symmet-
ric condition, a non-zero TOF suggests that the masses
of the two fragments are not equal since the distance of
the two PPACs to the target is the same. The decreas-
ing trend of the black squares for the conditional events
means that the mass asymmetry of the ﬁssion fragments
decreases with increasing (decreasing) the folding angle
(LMT). Moreover,
in the overlapped region, the data
points situate on top of each other with and without the
geometrically symmetric condition, suggesting that the
geometrical asymmetry is not the main reason for the
variation of ∆T OF . The overall descent trend of ∆T OF
with ΘFF suggests that the mass asymmetry of the fast
ﬁssion increases with the LMT of the reactions. We note
that the result is independent of the assumption of Vi-
ola systematics of Eq. (3) since only the original timing
information directly from the experiment is used here.

ference ∆T OF vs the folding angle ΘFF in two-body ﬁssion

Further, we present in Fig. 19 the average (a) and
the standard deviation (b) of the reconstructed velocities
of the FFs recorded in the two PPACs as a function of
folding angle. Here Eq.
(1-3) are used. From panel
(a), it can be seen that the average velocity value (cid:104)vf (cid:105) of
the fragments measured in PPAC 1 and PPAC 2 show

tribution (a) and its standard deviation (b) as a function of

and PPAC3, respectively.

The distribution properties of σ(∆φ) and σ(∆T OF )
as a function of folding angle reﬂects part of the dy-
namic feature of fast ﬁssion that the scission point is
early reached when the excitation energy of the TLF is
still high. Thus the post-scission emission of particles
may change the direction of the FFs. In addition, due
to the incomplete de-excitation at the scission point, the
statistical ﬂuctuation enhances the variance of the masses
and the velocity of the FF. This is consistent with the

at 25 MeV/u [52]. The other important feature of fast
ﬁssion, the time scale τf , is not measured and calls for fur-
ther experimental eﬀorts in two directions: i) By securing
the ﬁrst layer of the SSD telescope to measure the whole
energy spectra, one can ﬁt the spectra by including the
post-scission source and derive the ﬁssion time constant
τf from the pre-, and post-scission particle multiplicity
in statistical decay model [53], ii) Alternatively, one can
also secure the start timing information from the RF of
the machine to measure the velocity of FFs without in-
troducing the two mentioned assumptions. Furthermore,
in this case, the rotation of the ﬁssioning system can be
reconstructed, and the τf can be derived if is given the
rotational angular velocity [54].

B. Results for Light Charged Particles

In this subsection, we investigate the emission of light-
charged particles associated with ﬁssion.
It is helpful
to compare the LCP production with and without co-
incidence with the ﬁssion fragments to infer fast-ﬁssion
particle emission characteristics. Fig. 20 (a) presents the
yield ratio of various species between exclusive events (in
coincidence with FFs) and inclusive events as a function
of emission angle in the laboratory frame. The overall
value of the ratios is in the order of a few percent since the
PPACs only cover a small part of the whole space. Nev-
ertheless, it is shown that generally, in the whole angular
range, the ratio decreases with increasing the mass of the
particle. Noticing from the phase space of the LCPs in
the experiment, it suggests that the dynamic emission of
lighter particles is relatively easier than heavier particles
in ﬁssion events. Alternatively, the dynamic emission of
heavier particles, since it may happen earlier, takes away
more excitation energy and reduces the probability of fast
ﬁssion [55].

More speciﬁcally, Fig. 20 (b) presents the double ra-
tio of t/3He (red) and d/4He (blue) between the exclusive
events and the inclusive events, respectively. For the pair
of t/3He, the mass of the two particles is the same while
the neutron richness diﬀers. The value of the double
ratio is larger than unity, indicating that tritons are rela-
tively easier to be emitted dynamically than 3He in ﬁssion
events. It is in qualitative agreement with the prediction
of the transport model simulations [44], namely, the oc-
currence of fast ﬁssion favors the emission of neutron-rich
species. For the pair of d/4He, the two particles have the
same isospin content but diﬀerent mass. As shown, with
the increasing of θlab, the double ratio of d/4He, which
is larger than unity again, exhibits an upward trend. It
suggests similarly that the events with ﬁssion favor the
production of particles with smaller masses in accordance
with the results in panel (a), particularly at large angles
corresponding to dynamic emissions.

It is of interest to look into the angular distribution
of the particle emission. Since the particle emission oc-

curs in competition with ﬁssion, the angular distribution
of the particles w.r.t.
the ﬁssion axis can be used to
characterize the deformation, and the angular momen-
tum of the ﬁssioning nuclei before scission point [5, 6].
Similarly, for the dynamic emission of the LCPs in the
fast ﬁssion induced by heavy-ion reactions, the angular
distribution of the LCPs w.r.t. the ﬁssion axis carries in-
formation of the dynamic evolution of the ﬁssion process.
In the current experiment, however, since the derivation
of the velocity of the two FFs relies on the assumptions
mentioned in Section 3, the ﬁssion axis is not precisely
determined, preventing us from discussing the angular
distribution w.r.t. the ﬁssion axis. Nevertheless, we can
simply investigate the LCP emissions as a function of the
laboratory angle θlab, which is in turn correlated with
the angle of LCPs with respect to the ﬁssion plane θfp
because the PPACs cover very limited range in azimuth.
Fig. 21 presents the distribution of θlab for the Z = 1
isotopes. The results of 3He and 4He are not shown be-
cause of the lower statistics. To view the eﬀect of the
reaction violence, we divide the folding angle into three
windows as 85◦ − 105◦, 105◦ − 135◦ and 135◦ − 165◦, rep-

angle window, the total number of events are normalized
to the same value in order to conveniently compare the
features of all ΘFF windows. Interestingly, in the small
angular regime with θlab ≈ 25◦ covered by SSD-Tel 2, the
yield of LCPs with larger folding angle (smaller LMT) is
more abundant, while in the large angular regime with
θlab ≈ 50◦ covered by SSD-Tel 1, the opposite trend is
evident. The relative diﬀerence is approximately 50% at
large angles. We note here that this diﬀerence is not
due to the threshold eﬀect because the threshold of the
two SSD telescopes is very close. It suggests that for the
events with large LMT, emissions of light particles are
increasingly enhanced at a large angle. It is consistent
with the picture that the contribution of the intermedi-
ate velocity source increases with increasing the LMT or
the violence of the collisions between the projectile and
the target.

11

gests that neutron-rich species tend to be emitted in the
forward angle region in the fast ﬁssion event. The diﬀer-
ence becomes increasingly enhanced if the folding angle
(LMT) decreases (increases). These results are consistent
with our early experimental results in the same reaction,
where the inclusive production of the light-charged par-
ticles are recorded [45, 46]. The angular evolution of
the neutron excess of the light charged particles in coin-
cidence with ﬁssion fragments provides a novel probe to
the density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy [44, 46].
Compared to the inclusive measurement, and the exclu-
sive measurement in coincidence with ﬁssion events helps
determine the event geometry so that the comparison to
the transport model is better constrained. The theoreti-
cal eﬀorts along this direction are welcomed.

V. SUMMARY

Fig. 22 (a − c) presents the isotopic yield ratio RI of
p/d and t/d as a function of θlab in the same three ΘFF
windows. It is shown that in all ΘFF windows, the ra-
tio of p/d increases with θlab while that of t/d decreases
with θlab. The opposite trend for these two ratios sug-

To summarize, the ﬁssion fragments and the coincident
light charged particles had been measured in the experi-
ment of 40Ar + 197Au reactions at 30 MeV/u. The ﬁssion
fragments are measured using PPACs, and the LCPs are
measured using SSD telescopes. Using the Viola system-

ity between the ﬁssion fragments is 2.4 cm/ns, the event
topology can be reconstructed, with the folding angle
representing the linear momentum transfer. The broad-
ening of the azimuthal diﬀerence ∆φ between the two
ﬁssion fragments increases with LMT, suggesting the in-
creasing contribution of the post-scission emission, which
smears the back-to-back feature of the two-body process.
The diﬀerence of the time-of-ﬂight between the two frag-
ments also exhibits an increasing width as a function of
LMT, suggesting that the mass distribution of the ﬁssion
fragments tends to be broadened if more momentum is
transferred to the ﬁssioning system.

The occurrence of fast ﬁssion brings some enhance-
ment of the emission of particles with smaller mass or
higher neutron richness, as demonstrated by comparing
the yield of the LCPs in the event groups with and with-
out recording the ﬁssion fragments in coincidence.
In
the events followed by fast ﬁssion, the emission of LCPs
becomes relatively more abundant in the intermediate
angles than the forward angles when the LMT increases,
indicating more contribution of the intermediate veloc-
ity source with increasing the violence of the reaction.

12

Commonly for all LMT windows, the contribution of the
neutron-rich (neutron-deﬁcient) particles is more abun-
dantly emitted at a smaller (larger) angle in the labo-
ratory frame, according to the results obtained in the
previously inclusive experiment. The exclusive measure-
ment is more beneﬁcial than future transport model sim-
ulations aiming to extract the nuclear symmetry energy.
The studies call for more attention from model simula-
tions to reveal the isospin dynamics and constrain the
nuclear symmetry energy in heavy ion-induced ﬁssion re-
actions at Fermi energies.
