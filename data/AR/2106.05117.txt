SOME VARIATIONS ON THE EXTREMAL INDEX

GLORIA BURITIC ´A, NICOLAS MEYER, THOMAS MIKOSCH,
AND OLIVIER WINTENBERGER

Abstract. We re-consider Leadbetter’s extremal index for stationary
sequences.
It has interpretation as reciprocal of the expected size of
an extremal cluster above high thresholds. We focus on heavy-tailed
time series, in particular on regularly varying stationary sequences, and
discuss recent research in extreme value theory for these models. A
regularly varying time series has multivariate regularly varying ﬁnite-
dimensional distributions. Thanks to results by Basrak and Segers [2]
we have explicit representations of the limiting cluster structure of ex-
tremes, leading to explicit expressions of the limiting point process of
exceedances and the extremal index as a summary measure of extremal
clustering. The extremal index appears in various situations which do
not seem to be directly related, like the convergence of maxima and
point processes. We consider diﬀerent representations of the extremal
index which arise from the considered context. We discuss the theory
and apply it to a regularly varying AR(1) process and the solution to
an aﬃne stochastic recurrence equation.

Some personal words by Thomas Mikosch. During my PhD studies
at the University of Leningrad 1981–1984 I met Yasha Nikitin at seminars
and workshops at LOMI (now POMI) and the university. I remember him as
a professor who had a lot of humor and a balanced personality. Later, since
the 1990s, Yasha Nikitin became a representative of Russian Probability
Theory and Mathematical Statistics with a high international reputation. I
appreciated his cosmopolitan attitude. Whenever one needed constructive
advice as regards some international scientiﬁc event (such as the European
Meeting of Statisticians) or editorial issues, he would help. He supported the
Bernoulli Society actively, as an organization which embraces all European
probabilists and statisticians.

I met Yasha at the Vilnius Conference in 2018 at the last time and, as
always, I enjoyed his warm-hearted personality. He went from us too early.
His achievements for Probability Theory and Statistics at the University of
St. Petersburg and worldwide remain alive.

1. Leadbetter’s approach to modeling the extremes of a

stationary sequence

The paper by Leadbetter [22] and the book of Leadbetter, Lindgren and
Rootz´en [23] provided a ﬁrst systematic approach to the extreme value the-
ory of dependent stationary sequences. In particular, Leadbetter introduced
mixing and anti-clustering conditions, the conditions D and D(cid:48), which are
tailored for the analysis of dependent extremal events. Moreover, [23] prop-
agated the use of the extremal index as a measure for extremal clustering.

The idea of an extremal index originates from [25, 24, 27] who discovered

that the maxima

Mn = max
t=1,...,n

Xt ,

n (cid:62) 1 ,

of numerous examples of dependent stationary sequences (Xt) with common
distribution F share the property that

P(Mn (cid:54) un) ≈ (cid:2)P(X (cid:54) un)(cid:3)n θX = (cid:0)(F (un))n(cid:1)θX ,

n → ∞ ,

for some number θX ∈ [0, 1] provided (un) is a sequence of high thresh-
olds converging suﬃciently fast to the right endpoint xF of F . Leadbetter
[22] made this notion precise as the expected size of an extremal cluster of
exceedances above high-level thresholds. Since (F (un))n is the distribution
function of the maximum of n iid random variables with common distribu-
tion F at the threshold un, the quantity θX describes the shrinking eﬀect
that the appearance of dependent extremes may have on the distribution of
Mn compared to (F (un))n.

Leadbetter deﬁned the extremal index θX as follows: assume that for

every τ ∈ (0, ∞) there exists a sequence (un(τ )) such that

n F (un(τ )) = n (1 − F (un(τ ))) → τ,

and there exists a number θX such that

P(Mn (cid:54) un(τ )) → e −τ θX ,

n → ∞ .

If such a number θX exists it belongs to the interval [0, 1] and is independent
of the choice of the sequences (un).

An immediate application is to the convergence in distribution of the
sequence (Mn). Assume that (Xt) belongs to the maximum domain of at-
traction of an extreme value distribution H, i.e., for iid copies ( (cid:101)Xt) of X1,
(cid:102)Mn = max( (cid:101)X1, . . . , (cid:101)Xn), there exist constants cn > 0, dn ∈ R such that
n ( (cid:102)Mn − dn) d→ ξ as n → ∞ and ξ has distribution H. Then if (Xt) has an
c−1
extremal index θX we have

n → ∞ ,

x ∈ suppH .

SOME VARIATIONS ON THE EXTREMAL INDEX

3

In the case of an iid sequence it is easily seen that n F (un(τ )) → τ holds if
and only if P(Mn (cid:54) un(τ )) → e −τ . Hence θX = 1. The extremal index 1 is
not exclusive to iid sequences. Indeed, in the book [23] various examples of
strictly stationary sequences are considered for which θX = 1. For example,
if (Xt) is a Gaussian stationary sequence whose autocovariance function
satisﬁes cov(X0, Xh) = o(1/ log h) as h → ∞, then θX = 1.

2. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the extremal

index

The extremal index is often interpreted as the reciprocal of the expected
size of an extremal cluster for a stationary sequence (Xt). We will give some
justiﬁcation for this interpretation.

2.1. The method of block maxima. The key is the deﬁnition of an ex-
tremal cluster in the sample X1, . . . , Xn: split the sample into kn = [n/rn]
blocks of equal length rn:
X1, . . . , Xrn
(cid:123)(cid:122)
(cid:125)
(cid:124)
Block 1

, . . . , X(kn−1) rn+1, . . . , Xkn rn
(cid:125)

, Xrn+1, . . . , X2 rn

(cid:123)(cid:122)
(cid:124)
Block 2

(cid:124)

,

(cid:123)(cid:122)
Block kn

we ignore the last block of length less than rn, and we simply call a block
an extremal cluster relative to a high threshold u = un (this means that
un ↑ xF as n → ∞) if there is at least one exceedance of this threshold in
this block. For an asymptotic theory it will be important that r = rn → ∞
such that rn is small compared to n, i.e., kn → ∞.

In view of the stationarity of (Xt) the expected cluster size of a block is

given by

(cid:104) rn(cid:88)

Obviously, θn is a number in [0, 1]. Under mild regularity conditions the limit
θ = limn→∞ θn exists, assumes values in (0, 1] and coincides with Leadbet-
ter’s extremal index θX ; see Theorem 2.3 below. For this reason, the ex-
tremal index θX is often referred to as the reciprocal of the expected extremal
cluster size above high thresholds.

2.2. Approximation of θX by θn. The following result can be found in
slightly diﬀerent forms in [9], proof of Lemma 2.8, [34, 2].

Theorem 2.3. Consider the following conditions:

(1) (Xt) is a real-valued stationary sequence whose marginal distribution F

of freedom (red dots). The values of Xt typically appear in clusters of size 3. The
process (|Xt|) has extremal index θ|X| = 1/3.

the 10% and 90% quantiles of the data. The extremes typically appear in clusters.

(2) For a sequence un ↑ xF and an integer sequence r = rn → ∞ such that

Here Ma,b = maxi=a,...,b Xi for a (cid:54) b such that Mb = Ma,b with a = 1.
(3) A mixing condition holds:

(2.2)

P(Mn (cid:54) un) − (cid:0)P(Mrn
where (un), (kn) and (rn) are as in (2).
(4) For all positive τ there exists a sequence (un) = (un(τ )) such that
n F (un) → τ and (2), (3) are satisﬁed for these sequences (un).

and lim inf n→∞ θn > 0.
2. If (1) and (4) are satisﬁed and θ = limn→∞ θn exists, then θX ∈ (0, 1]
exists and coincides with θ.

Condition (2.2) is satisﬁed for strongly mixing (Xt) with mixing rate
(αh) if one can ﬁnd integer sequences ((cid:96)n) and (rn) such that (cid:96)n/rn → 0,
rn/n → 0 and knα(cid:96)n → 0 as n → ∞. Anti-clustering conditions are common
in extreme value theory since Leadbetter introduced the D(cid:48) condition which
is much stronger than (2.1) but also easily veriﬁed on examples. The goal
of such a condition is to avoid that the stationary sequence stays above a
high threshold for too long.

Relation (2.3) is in agreement with O ’Brien’s [28] characterization of the

extremal index of (Xt) as the limit
P(M(cid:96)n

(2.4)

θX = lim
n→∞

(cid:54) un | X0 > un),

for a sequence ((cid:96)n) with (cid:96)n/n → 0, thresholds un ↑ xF such that n F (un) → 1
as n → ∞, provided a mixing condition holds. O’Brien’s condition (2.4) has
the advantage that it avoids the deﬁnition of an extremal cluster.

Remark 2.4. Relation (2.3) provides a constructive way of calculating θX :
(cid:1) exist for
if we know that the limits f (k) := limn→∞ P(cid:0)Mk (cid:54) un | X0 > un
every k (cid:62) 1 then we can try to derive θX = limk→∞ f (k). In Section 3 we
will follow this approach in the case of a regularly varying sequence.

3. Regularly varying sequences

3.1. Deﬁnition and examples. As a matter of fact, clusters of extremes
are more prominent in stationary sequences with heavy-tailed marginal dis-
tribution. To illustrate this fact, consider a stationary causal AR(1) process
which solves the diﬀerence equation Xt = ϕ Xt−1 + Zt, t ∈ Z, for an iid noise
sequence (Zt). Necessarily, ϕ ∈ (−1, 1) and, if (Zt) is iid standard normal
then (|Xt|) has extremal index θ|X| = 1 (see [23]), while for iid student noise
(Zt) with α degrees of freedom we have θ|X| = 1 − |ϕ|α; see Example 3.4
below. Thus, the smaller α (the heavier the tail) for given ϕ the closer θ|X|
to zero.

An AR(1) process with student noise is an example of a regularly varying
time series. This class of heavy-tailed processes has been studied rather
extensively in the last 15 years; see [31] for some basics about multivari-
ate regular variation, and [21] for a recent textbook treatment. This class
was considered in full generality ﬁrst by [9]: they required that the ﬁnite-
dimensional distributions of the process satisfy a multivariate regular varia-
tion condition; see [30, 31] for the deﬁnition of this notion. It is an extension

6

G. BURITICA, N. MEYER, T. MIKOSCH, AND O. WINTENBERGER

of power-law tail behavior from the univariate to the multivariate case de-
ﬁned via the vague convergence of tail measures with inﬁnite limit measures
which have the homogeneity property.

Here we will follow an alternative approach by [2] tailored for stationary
sequences, avoiding the vague convergence concept. They proved that a
real-valued stationary sequence (Xt) is regularly varying with index α > 0
in the sense of [9] if and only if there exists a sequence (Θt) and a Pareto(α)
distributed random variable Y , i.e., P(Y > y) = y−α, y > 1, such that (Θt)
and Y are independent and, for all h (cid:62) 0,

P(cid:0)x−1(Xt)|t|(cid:54)h ∈ · (cid:12)

(cid:12) |X0| > x(cid:1) w→ P(cid:0)Y (Θt)|t|(cid:54)h ∈ ·(cid:1) ,
In the latter relation x can be replaced by any sequence (an) such that
n P(|X| > an) → 1 as n → ∞. Moreover, by deﬁnition, |Θ0| = 1 a.s. The
sequence (Θt) is the spectral tail process of the regularly varying process
(Xt); it describes the propagation of a value |X0| > x for large x through
the stationary sequence (Xt) into its past and future.

x → ∞ .

Example 3.1. We consider a stationary AR(1) process given as the causal
solution to the diﬀerence equation Xt = ϕ Xt−1 + Zt, t ∈ Z, where (Zt) is iid
regularly varying with index α (e.g. Pareto(α) or student(α)). This means
that a generic element Z satisﬁes limx→∞ P(±Z > x)/P(|Z| > x) = p± for
non-negative values p± such that p+ + p− = 1, and P(|Z| > x) = L(x)x−α,
x > 0, for some slowly varying function L. Then a generic element X inherits
the regularly varying tail behavior from Z (see [10]):

P(±X > x)
P(|Z| > x)

j=0

(cid:2)p± (ϕj)α

(cid:3) = P(Θ0 = ±1)(1 − |ϕ|α) .

But even more is true: (Xt) is a regularly varying time series with spectral
tail process
Θt = ΘZ sign(ϕJ+t) |ϕ|t11(J + t (cid:62) 0) = Θ0 ϕt 11(J + t (cid:62) 0) ,
(3.1)
where P(ΘZ = ±1) = p±, ΘZ is independent of J which has distribution

t ∈ Z ,

P(J = j) = (1 − |ϕ|α) |ϕ|j α ,

j (cid:62) 0 .

In particular, the forward spectral tail process is given by Θt = Θ0 ϕt, t (cid:62) 0.

Example 3.2. We consider the unique causal solution to the aﬃne sto-
chastic recurrence equation Xt = At Xt−1 + Bt, t ∈ Z, for an iid sequence
((At, Bt))t∈Z with generic element (A, B) ∈ R2
+. We assume that the dis-
tribution of (A, B) satisﬁes the conditions of the Kesten-Goldie theory; see
[20, 13], cf.
[6] for a textbook treatment. The most important condition
in this context is the existence of a unique solution α > 0 to the equation
E[Aα] = 1 which yields the tail index α. Under these conditions for a generic
element X, there exists a positive constant c+ such that
P(X > x) ∼ c+ x−α ,

x → ∞ .

SOME VARIATIONS ON THE EXTREMAL INDEX

The forward spectral process is then given by

(Θt)t(cid:62)0 = (Πt)t(cid:62)0 , where Πt = A1 · · · At ,

while the backward spectral tail process (Θt)t(cid:54)−1 has a rather complicated
structure.

Writing St = log Πt = (cid:80)t

i=1 log Ai, t (cid:62) 1, we observe that (St) constitutes
a random walk with a negative drift. Indeed, by Jensen’s inequality we have
E[log(Aα)] < log(E[Aα]) = 0.

3.2. The extremal index. Following Remark 2.4, we will derive the ex-
tremal index θX of a stationary non-negative regularly varying sequence
(Xt) in terms of its spectral tail process. First, we observe that by virtue of
the continuous mapping theorem, as n → ∞ for k (cid:62) 1,

P(cid:0)a−1

n Mk (cid:54) 1 (cid:12)
→ P(cid:0)Y max

Here we used the fact that Y −α is U (0, 1) uniformly distributed and Θ0 = 1

From Theorem 2.3 we obtain the following result in [2].

Corollary 3.3. Consider a non-negative stationary regularly varying pro-
cess (Xt) with index α > 0. Then the following statements hold:

1. If the anti-clustering condition (2.1) holds for (un) = (x an) and some
x > 0 then the limit θ = limn→∞ θn exists, is positive and has the represen-
tations

2. If (2.1) and the mixing condition (2.2) hold for (un) = (x an) and all
x > 0 then the extremal index θX exists and coincides with θ.

The representations of θ given in (3.2) only depend on the forward spectral
process (Θt)t(cid:62)0. In Proposition 3.10 below we provide representations of the
extremal index θ|X| depending on the whole spectral tail process (Θt)t∈Z.

Example 3.4. We consider the regularly varying AR(1) process from Exam-
ple 3.1. It can be shown to satisfy the anti-clustering and mixing conditions

chastic recurrence equation under the conditions and with the notation of
Example 3.2. It can be shown to satisfy the anti-clustering and mixing con-
ditions of Theorem 2.3; see [6]. We conclude from this result that (Xt) has

is diﬃcult; see Example 3.12 for an exception.

Lemma 3.6. Consider a non-negative stationary regularly varying sequence

Proof. Write (Yt) = Y (Θt) where the Pareto(α) variable Y and the spectral
tail process (Θt) are independent. We start by showing

Since (Xt) is regularly varying we have for all x > 0 and integers k (cid:62) 1,

On the other hand, using the anti-clustering condition (2.1) for all x ∈ (0, 1],
we have for ﬁxed k, h (cid:62) 1,

and the right-hand side term εk vanishes for large k. Hence, letting h → ∞,
we obtain for all x > 0,

the terminology of the spectral tail process.

We adapt the mixing condition in [9] tailored for point process conver-
gence. It is expressed in terms of the Laplace functionals of point processes.

indeed. Relation (3.5) ensures that, if Nn

ensures that the limit processes considered are inﬁnitely divisible; cf. [19].

Remark 3.9. In view of Lemma 3.6 we know that (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)α < ∞ a.s. Hence
the spectral cluster process Q is well deﬁned.

Since the Poisson points (Γ−1/α

θ|X| plays an important role in representation (3.7). Each Poisson point
(Γi/θ|X|)−1/α stands for the radius of a circle around the origin, and the
points ( (cid:101)Qij)j∈Z are inside or on this circle. In this sense, each Poisson point
(Γi/θ|X|)−1/α creates an extremal cluster. Therefore we refer to the process
N as a cluster Poisson process.

3.3.3. Equivalent expressions for the extremal index. Based on the results
in the previous subsection we can derive equivalent expressions of θ|X| in
terms of QT ∗ and T ∗.

SOME VARIATIONS ON THE EXTREMAL INDEX

13

Proposition 3.10. Assume the conditions of Theorem 3.8. Then the ex-
tremal index θ|X| of (|Xt|) coincides with the following quantities:

E[|QT ∗|α] = P(Y |QT ∗| > 1) = P(T ∗ = 0) .

(3.8)
Here Y is a Pareto(α) random variable independent of QT ∗ and T ∗ is the
time of the largest record of (|Θt|).

Remark 3.11. We observe that

E[|QT ∗|α] = E

(cid:104) maxt∈Z |Θt|α
j∈Z |Θj|α

(cid:80)

(cid:105)

= θ|X| .

Since θ|X| = P(T ∗ = 0) the extremal index θ|X| has the intuitive interpreta-
tion as the probability that (|Θt|) assumes its largest value at time zero.

Example 3.12. We consider the regularly varying solution of an aﬃne
stochastic recurrence equation under the conditions and with the notation
of Example 3.2. An exception where the extremal index has an explicit
solution is the case log At = Nt − 0.5 for an iid standard normal sequence
(Nt). Then E[At] = 1 and the theory mentioned in Example 3.2 yields
regular variation of (Xt) with index 1. Using the expression P(T ∗ = 0) and
applying some random walk theory (such as the results in [8]), one obtains
an exact expression for θX in terms of the Riemann zeta function ζ; see
Example 3.13. A ﬁrst order approximation to this formula is given by

4. Estimation of the extremal index - a short review and a

new estimator based on the spectral cluster process

First approaches to the estimation of the extremal index are due to [17,
38]. Estimators based on exceedences of a threshold were proposed in [12,
35, 36, 33]. A modern approach to the maxima method was started in [26];
improvements and asymptotic limit theory can be found in [3, 5].

We will consider some standard estimators of θX . For the sake of argu-
ment we assume that (Xt) is a non-negative stationary process with mar-
ginal distribution F , kn = n/rn is an integer sequence such that rn → ∞,
kn → ∞, and (un) is a threshold sequence satisfying un ↑ xF .

4.1. Blocks estimator. Recall that θX has interpretation as the reciprocal
of the expected size of extremal clusters. This idea is the basis for inference
procedures from the early 1990s (see [37, 11]). Clusters are identiﬁed as
blocks of length r = rn with at least one exceedance of a high threshold
u = un. A blocks estimator (cid:98)θbl is given by the ratio of the number Kn(u)

16

G. BURITICA, N. MEYER, T. MIKOSCH, AND O. WINTENBERGER

of such clusters and the total number of exceedences Nn(u):

(4.11)

(cid:98)θbl
u (r) =

Kn(u)
Nn(u)

:=

(cid:80)kn

t=1 11(M(t−1)r+1,t r > u)
t=1 11(Xt > u)

(cid:80)n

.

This method requires the choice of block length r and threshold level u
satisfying rnF (un) → 0; if rn → ∞ does not hold at the prescribed rate
(cid:98)θbl is biased. Estimators using clusters of extreme exceedences were also
considered in [17].

A slight modiﬁcation of the blocks estimator is the disjoint blocks estima-

tor of [38]:

log(1 − Kn(u)/kn)
r log(1 − Nn(u)/n)
Assuming some weak dependence condition on (Xt), the heuristic idea be-
hind the estimator is the approximations

(cid:98)θdbl =

.

(cid:0)P(Mr (cid:54) un)(cid:1)kn ≈ P(Mn (cid:54) un) ≈ F θX n(un),

for a suitable sequence (un). Then, taking logarithms and replacing F (un)
and P(Mn > un) by their empirical estimators Nn(u)/n and Kn(u)/kn,
respectively, we obtain

θX ≈

≈

=

log P(Mn (cid:54) un)
n log F (un)
log(1 − Kn(u)/kn)
rn log(1 − Nn(u)/n)

log(1 − P(Mn > un))
n log(1 − F (un))

= (cid:98)θdbl .

Assuming that both Kn(u)/kn and Nn(u)/n converge to zero, a Taylor ex-
pansion of log(1 + x) = x(1 + o(1)) as x → 0 shows that (cid:98)θbl ≈ (cid:98)θdbl.
[38]
showed that (cid:98)θdbl has a smaller asymptotic variance than (cid:98)θbl. [33] proposed
a sliding blocks version of (cid:98)θdbl with an even smaller asymptotic variance.

4.2. Runs and intervals estimator. [38] proposed the alternative runs
(cid:54)
estimator. It is based on the limit relation (2.4): the probability P(M(cid:96)n
un | X0 > un) is replaced by a sample version for some sequence l = ln →
∞:

Clusters are considered distinct if they are separated by at least l obser-
vations not exceeding u.
In [12] a complete study of the runs estimator
and the inter-exceedence times is given. The thresholds (un) need to satisfy
rnF (un) → 1, and ln (cid:54) rn.

SOME VARIATIONS ON THE EXTREMAL INDEX

17

Consider the exceedance times:

S0(u) = 0 ,

Si(u) = min{t > Si−1(u) : Xt > un} ,
with inter-exceedance times Ti(u) = Si(u) − Si−1(u), i (cid:62) 1. The sequence
(Ti(u))i(cid:62)2 constitutes a stationary sequence. If rn F (un) → 1, [12] noticed
that (n T2(u)) converges in distribution to a limiting mixture given by (1 −
θX )110(x) + θX (1 − e −θX x), x (cid:62) 0. Calculation yields to the coeﬃcient of
variation ν of T2(u) whose square is given by
ν2 = var(T2(u))/(E[T2(u)])2 = E[T 2

2 (u)]/(E[T2(u)])2 − 1 = 2/θX − 1 ,

i (cid:62) 1 ,

leading to overdispersion ν > 0 if and only if θX < 1. Replacing the mo-
ments on the left-hand side by sample versions and adjusting the empirical
moments for bias, [12] arrived at the intervals estimator

4.3. Northrop’s estimator. Assume for the moment that (Xi) is iid and
F is continuous. Then F (X) is uniform on (0, 1). Hence for r = rn and
x > 0,

P(cid:0) − rn log F (Mr) > x(cid:1) = P(F (Mr) (cid:54) e −x/r)

= P( max

i=1,...,rn

F (Xi) (cid:54) e −x/r)

= (cid:0)P(F (X) (cid:54) e −x/r)(cid:1)r = e −x .

For a weakly dependent sequence (Xi) with marginal distribution F , assume
the existence of the extremal index for (F (Xt)) which, by monotonicity of
F , coincides with θX :
P(cid:0) − rn log F (Mr) > x(cid:1) = P( max
i=1,...,rn

F (Xi) < e −x/r) → e −θX x ,

x > 0 .

Thus the random variables (−rn log F (Mr)) are asymptotically Exp(θX )
distributed. For iid Exp(θX ) random variables the maximum likelihood es-
timator of θX is given by the reciprocal of the sample mean. These ideas
lead to Northrop’s estimators [26]. Mimicking the maximum likelihood es-
timator of iid Exp(θX ) data for a stationary sequence (Xt), one considers
the quantities −rn log F (Mt,t+r), t = 1, . . . , n − rn, and constructs sliding
or disjoint blocks estimators of θX :

Here Fn is the empirical distribution function of the data. This particular
choice of estimator of F depends on the whole sample, hence introduces
additional dependence. This fact requires an optimal choice of block length
rn for implementation.

4.4. An estimator based on the spectral cluster process. In this sub-
section we consider a stationary non-negative regularly varying process (Xt)
with index α > 0, spectral tail process (Θt) and normalizing sequence (an)
satisfying n P(X > an) → 1. Proposition 3.10 yields the alternative repre-
sentation θX = E[Qα
T ∗] where (Qt) is the spectral cluster process of (Xt).
We will construct an estimator based on this identity.

We consider sums and maxima over disjoint blocks of size r = rn = o(n):

i,r :=

which is based on large deviation results for regularly varying stationary
sequences; see for example [7]. Now we build an estimator of θX from an
empirical version of the left-hand expectation. Deﬁne the corresponding
estimator by

5. A Monte-Carlo study of the estimators

We run a short study based on 1 000 simulated processes (Xt)t=1,...,5000
for comparing the performances of some of the aforementioned estimators.
First, (Xt) is an AR(1) process with parameter ϕ = 0.2 and iid student(1)
noise, resulting in a regularly varying process with index 1 and θ|X| = 0.8.
Second, we consider the regularly varying solution of an aﬃne stochastic
recurrence equation with iid log At ∼ N (−0.5, 1), Bt ≡ 1, and θX ≈ 0.2792;
see (3.9).

Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show boxplots of the simulation study.

• (cid:98)θbl and (cid:98)θruns are functions of the block and run lengths, respectively.

u is the largest [n0.6]th upper order statistic of the sample.

• (cid:98)θslbl is a function of r. u is the rth upper order statistic of the

sample.

• (cid:98)θint is a function of x. u is the [n/x]th upper order statistic.

• (cid:98)θNsl, (cid:98)θscp are functions of r.
• For (cid:98)θscp we choose s = [n0.6/r]. The tail index α is estimated by the
Hill estimator from [14] based on [n0.8] upper order statistics of the
sample.

According to the folklore in the literature, Northrop’s estimator (cid:98)θNsl out-
performs the classical estimators (runs, blocks); it has smallest variance but
it may be diﬃcult to control its bias. Our experience with (cid:98)θscp shows that
it performs better than the other estimators as regards the bias, especially
when θX is small. The intervals estimator (cid:98)θint is preferred by practitioners
because the choice of the hyperparameter x is robust with respect to dif-
ferent values of θX . This cannot be said about the other estimators with
the exception of (cid:98)θscp. In our experiments with sample size n = 5000, the
choices x = 32 and r = 64 work well for (cid:98)θint and (cid:98)θscp, respectively. We did
not ﬁne-tune the hyperparameter s in (cid:98)θscp in our experiments.
