Abstract: 

We  investigate  positron  scattering  upon  endohedrals  and  compare  it  with  electron-
endohedral scattering. We show that the polarization of the fullerene shell considerably alters the 
polarization  potential  of  an  atom,  stuffed  inside  a  fullerene.  This  essentially  affects  both  the 
positron and electron elastic scattering phases as  well as corresponding cross-sections. Of great 
importance  is  also  the  interaction  between  the  incoming  positron  and  the  target  electrons  that 
leads  to  formation  the  virtual  positronium Ps .  We  illustrate  the  general  trend  by  concrete 
examples  of  positron  and  electron  scattering  upon  endohedrals  He@C60  and  Ar@C60,  and 
compare it to scattering upon fullerene C60. 

To obtain the presented results, we have employed new simplified approaches that permit 
to  incorporate  the  effect  of  fullerenes  polarizability  into  the  He@C60  and  Ar@C60  polarization 
potential and to take into account the virtual positronium formation. Using these approaches, we 
obtained numeric results that show strong variations in shape and magnitudes of scattering phases 
and cross-sections due to effect of endohedral polarization and  Ps  formation.

1. At first glance, the positron  e  scattering upon an endohedral one can treat similarly to 
electron  e   scattering  [1-3],  simply  by  neglecting  the  exchange  between  the  projectile  and  the 
target electrons. No doubt that the endohedral polarization that proved to be important in the low-
energy 

 [1-3] plays also an important role in 

collisions.

However, it was understood already long ago that in treating the  e

A   scattering, one has 
to  take  into  account  the  relatively  strong  interaction  between  e and  the  atomic  electrons.  This 
interaction impressively  modifies the motion of the  e e  pair in the field of the residual  ion A . 
Since the Hartree potential of A that acts upon  e is repulsive,  e  concentrates in the same areas 
as the virtually exited atomic electrons. They can form temporarily a virtual positronium  Ps [4, 5] 
that dramatically affects the  e  scattering cross-section. Our aim here is to check whether similar 
effect is of importance in low-energy elastic 

scattering.

 scattering,  two major effects  has to be  taken into  account 

simultaneously, namely the polarizability of the target endohedral and the effect of Ps  formation. 
We also have to estimate the alteration of the endohedral potential, when one goes from  e  to  e  
as a projectile.

We  discussed  already  in  [1,  2]  the  amazing  result  that  an  addition  of  a  single  relatively 
small atom inside a fullerene affects essentially the electron elastic scattering cross-section of the 
latter, in spite the fact that the presence of an additional atom inside alters negligibly the total size 
of the target system under consideration. As it has been demonstrated in [1-3] that the quantum 
 of the partial wave 
interference changes the situation impressively, so that the total phase 
l  of  an  electron  scattered  upon  endohedral  A@CN  is  with  good  accuracy  equal  to  the  sum  of 
l  of an electron upon atom A, stuffed inside the fullerene CN, and 
scattering phases 
the  CN  itself.  This  was  dubbed  as  a  phase  additivity  rule.  It  means,  counterintuitively,  that  for 
e scattering a single atom contribution is quite big as compared to the background of CN cross-
section.

In  principal,  the  polarization  potentials  are  energy-dependent  and  non-local.  We  have  an 
experience to determine  it for electron-atoms scattering  employing perturbation theory  in inter-
electron interaction and limiting ourselves by second order perturbation theory in the interaction 
of  incoming  and  target  electrons  (see  [8]  and  references  therein).  Similar  approach  is  valid  for 
positron scattering. 

We solve the equation (1) in the integral form and in energy representation, where for partial

This  approach  accounts  for  non-locality  and  energy  dependence  of  the  polarization 
interaction,  but  to  be  accurate  enough  require  inclusion  of  sufficient  number  of  diagrams’ 
sequences.  Note  that  the  phases  determined  using  equations  (1)  and  (2)  or  (5)  and  (6)  are  the 
same (see e.g. [8]). This was checked by us also pure numerically, by applying both procedures 
to the case of an empty fullerene that led to identical results.

The p-partial cross-section for both  e  and  e has a 
strong maximum at about 0.1 Ry, the absolute value for 
e   being  1.5  times  bigger  than  for  e .  The  e   cross-
section  has  a  Ramsauer-type  deep  minimum  located  a 
little  bit  higher  for  p-wave,  at  0.5  Ry,  than  for  s-wave. 
For  e such a minimum is absent. 

Fig  3  present  the phases and partial  cross sections 
of  e   and  e   low-energy  elastic  scattering  upon  Ar, 
60@Ar C . For convenience of the reader, Fig. 3 includes 
the curves that represent the collision of  e  with  C60.  It 
appeared that while for the p-wave the rule of additivity 
is valid, it does not work for the s-wave.

Positron energy (Ry)

The  absence  of  exchange  with 

target 
constituents and  lack of  the real bound states  of  e with 
considered  targets  dictates  that  the  all  scattering  phases 
for the zero projectile energy has to be equal to zero. The 
fact  that  the  s-phase  has  in  Ar  a  non-zero  value  at  low 
energy  signals  the  presence  of  a  scattering  resonance 
close to zero energy. And indeed, the s-cross section has 
a powerful maximum (up to 500), and then, at about 0.3 
Ry,  has  a  very  deep  Ramsauer  minimum.  As  for  the  p-
wave, its maximum is at about 0.15Ry and is two times 
lower than for s-wave. The role of Ar inside C60 is noticeable for both considered partial waves – 
s and p.

6.  In this Letter we present an approach that permits to study the positron scattering upon 
endohedrals A@C60. This approach permits to take into account the polarization of A and C60 as 
well as the interference of their polarizabilities. Our approach also accounts for strong positron – 
target  electron  interaction  that  leads  to  the  concept  of  virtual  positronium  formation  in  the 
scattering process. 

60@He C   and

For  two  objects,  namely 

60@Ar C ,  we  performed  numeric  calculations  that 
demonstrate a prominent role of the atom A in the formation of the scattering cross-section and a 
big difference between the positron and electron scattering. As in the case of electron scattering 
upon endohedral, we observe a big difference for the cross-sections of fullerene and endohedral. 
It means that the cross section is determined by  quantum mechanics, losing its most prominent 
feature – dependence at low scattering energy only upon the size of the target. 

The observed resonance structure of the cross-sections deserves experimental investigation, 
since it permits to shed light on the difference in potentials, by which an endohedral acts upon a 
projectile – positron or electron. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We do believe that the suggested method and presented results of concrete calculations will 
stimulate theoretical  and  experimental  research  of  low-energy  elastic  scattering  of  positrons  by 
endohedral atoms.
