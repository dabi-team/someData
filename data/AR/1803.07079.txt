Abstract: In this article we show how the resummation of infrared and collinear loga-
rithms within Soft-Collinear Eﬀective Theory (SCET) can be formulated in a way that
makes it suitable for a Monte-Carlo implementation. This is done by applying the tech-
niques developed for automated resummation using the branching formalism, which have
resulted in the general resummation approach CAESAR/ARES. This work builds a connection
between the two resummation approaches, and paves the way to automated resummation in
SCET. As a case study we consider the resummation of the thrust distribution in electron-
positron collisions at next-to-leading logarithm (NLL). However, the results presented here
are easily generalizable to more complicated observables and processes as well as to higher
orders in the logarithmic accuracy.

A well known fact of perturbation theory is the presence of logarithmic terms, sensitive to
the ratio of scales in the problem, whose power grows with the perturbative order. For most
processes of interest at high energy colliders, two powers of such logarithms (L) arise for
every power of the strong coupling constant, and the numerical size of these logarithms can
be of order L ∼ 1/αs. This makes ﬁxed order (FO) perturbation theory for such processes
ill behaved, requiring a rearrangement of the perturbative expansion, in which these large
logarithms are resummed to all orders in perturbation theory. Instead of simply counting
the powers of the strong coupling constant, where NnLO refers to a calculation satisfying
σexact/σNnLO − 1 ∼ αn+1
, one instead performs a logarithmic resummation, in which NnLL

s

implies that ln[σexact/σNnLL] ∼ αm
s Lm−n for any m ≥ n. As long as the ratio of scales
in the logarithm is large (L (cid:29) 1), this reorganization of perturbation theory provides a
sensible expansion.

In this paper we will study the 2-jet cross section at lepton colliders (equivalent con-

siderations apply to the 0-jet cross sections at hadron colliders), that we denote as

Σ(v) =

1
σB

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

dΦn

dσ
dΦn

Θ [V (Φn) < v] ,

(1.1)

where σB denotes the Born cross section and V (Φn) an observable that goes to zero in the
Born kinematics. The radiation phase space Φn has the property that in the limit v → 0
each strongly interacting particle is either inﬁnitely soft or it is collinear to either of the
two Born legs (either the directions of the 2-jets in lepton colliders or the beam directions
for hadron colliders). The resummed expression commonly takes the form

Σ(v) = σB

(cid:104)
1 + αs C(1) + α2

s C(2) + . . .

(cid:105)

exp [Lg1(αsL) + g2(αsL) + . . .] .

(1.2)

Resummation to order NkLL requires knowledge of the functions gm(αsL) with m ≤ k + 1
and the coeﬃcients C(m) with m ≤ k − 1. So for example, for NLL resummation one needs
g1(αsL) and g2(αsL), but only the leading order coeﬃcient C(0) = 1.

There are two main approaches to calculate the resummed expressions. The ﬁrst is
based on deriving a factorization theorem for the speciﬁc cross section under consideration,
and then using evolution equations to resum the logarithms of the various ingredients of
the factorization theorem. This approach was started by Collins, Soper and Sterman [1],
where the transverse momentum distribution of the vector boson in W and Z production
was studied. The development of soft-collinear eﬀective theory (SCET) [2–5] has formu-
lated this approach in the framework of eﬀective ﬁeld theories. In SCET, the interactions
between particles are already factorized at the level of the Lagrangian [4]. As long as
the measurement function can be shown to factorize [6, 7], the relevant interactions can
be separated as arising from collinear and soft particles, which do not interact with one
another directly. Once a factorization theorem for a given observable has been derived, the
important property of SCET is that in dimensional regularization each element of the fac-
torization theorem only depends on a single scale through the ratio to the renormalization
scale [2,3]. This means that all logarithmic terms can be obtained from the renormalization
(RG) group evolution of each element in the factorization theorem, resulting in analytic
results for resummed cross sections.

An alternate approach to resummation is based on the branching formalism [8,9], which
is built on the factorization properties of the QCD squared amplitudes. It relies on slicing
the radiation phase space by means of a resolution scale q0 and then describing the radiation
of particles above and below that scale separately. At lowest order this approach is the
same as what is used in a parton shower, but by not requiring to produce fully exclusive
ﬁnal states which satisfy momentum conservation, one can systematically improve the
branching formalism to any logarithmic accuracy desired. The logarithmic dependence on
the resolution scale q0 cancels for infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables, leaving only

– 2 –

a power suppressed dependence on q0, which allows one to take the limit for q0 → 0. The
key diﬀerence between the branching formalism and the resummation from factorization
is that in the factorization approach the resummation is obtained by solving a set of
diﬀerential equations (RG equations in the case of SCET), while in the branching formalism
resummation is usually performed through an all order calculation in perturbation theory
using a Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm. For suﬃciently simple observables one can rewrite
the branching formalism in terms of diﬀerential equations, reproducing the results from
the factorization approach.

Each of these two approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. The factoriza-
tion approach has the advantage that to perform resummation only requires to obtain
the desired diﬀerential RG equations that, in particular using SCET, can be obtained by
computing well deﬁned loop diagrams. On the other hand, the formalism only works for
observables for which a factorization theorem is known. While these factorization theorems
can easily be obtained for the simplest observables, for more complicated observables the
factorization formulae are not known. In fact, the most diﬃcult part to obtain resumma-
tion in SCET is often the derivation of the appropriate factorization theorem. Since the
branching formalism does not rely on a speciﬁc factorization theorem, it can be applied
to a rather wide class of observables.
In fact, one can show that for any continuously
global, recursively infrared and collinear (rIRC) safe observable [10], resummed results can
be obtained using an appropriate MC algorithm. The downside of the branching formalism
is that going to higher logarithmic accuracy requires a careful deﬁnition of the necessary
squared amplitudes and phase space constraints, making extensions to arbitrarily high ac-
curacy less systematic. Besides the formulation of resummation, the two approaches diﬀer
in a number of important aspects. For instance, while in the branching formalism the
uncertainties associated with higher-order terms are estimated by varying the renormal-
ization (and factorization in the hadronic case) and resummation scales, in SCET each of
the ingredients of the factorization theorem has a characteristic scale that can be sepa-
rately varied (commonly done through proﬁle functions [11]) to estimate the perturbative
uncertainty. Another important diﬀerence is in the way the two methods are sensitive to
non-perturbative eﬀects. While in the branching formalism this sensitivity comes from
the scale at which the running coupling is evaluated, in a factorized approach one has an
operator deﬁnition of the factorization ingredients in the non-perturbative regime.

As was shown in refs [10, 12, 13], one can reduce the requirements of the accuracy of
the ingredients in the MC algorithm by one order if one has analytic knowledge of the
resummation of any other observable that has the same double logarithmic structure as
the observable one is interested in resumming. In other words, if one wants to resum Σ(v)
for a given observable v to order NnLL, and one knows the resummmation analytically for
Σ(vs), where vs is a diﬀerent (simpler) observable that has the same double logarithmic
structure as Σ(v), then the ratio Σ(v)/Σ(vs) can be computed using a MC that only requires
ingredients at Nn−1LL accuracy. This was used in [10] to construct a completely generic
method capable of computing any IRC safe observable to NLL accuracy. The simpliﬁed
observable was chosen such that the branching formalism could be solved analytically. This
approach was later reformulated to NNLL for generic rIRC safe observables in [13, 14] and

– 3 –

to even higher orders for speciﬁc observables [15].

Both approaches can be applied to obtain high-order resummations for a multitude of
ﬁnal-state observables for scattering processes in e+e− [13,14,16–23] as well as in hadronic
collisions [15, 24–39].

By combining the two approaches with one another one keeps the advantages of each,
while removing the main obstacle. If one can ﬁnd for any observable v a simpliﬁed ob-
servable vs with a simple factorization formula, one can use SCET to obtain the analytical
resummation of this simpliﬁed observable, while using the branching formalism to relate
this analytical result to the resummed result for the more complicated observable, for which
a factorization formula might be diﬃcult or impossible to obtain. This is in spirit very
similar to the CAESAR/ARES approach, but instead of ﬁnding a simpliﬁed observable for
which the branching formalism can be solved analytically, one chooses the simpliﬁed ob-
servable such that a factorization theorem is easily derived and its resummation performed
in SCET. In fact, there is a large body of observables for which high logarithmic accuracy
is known in SCET (see references above). By combining this with the branching formalism
allows one to obtain results for all related observables to the same level of accuracy.

It is this combination of SCET results with the branching formalism that we will
address in this paper. A major part of this discussion will explain how to deal with UV
divergent phase space regions that are crucial in the SCET approach (since it is the UV
divergences from these regions that give rise to the anomalous dimensions leading to the
RG equations in SCET), but can not be present in a MC approach which has to integrate
over physical regions of phase space. We will explain this combination using the thrust
distribution (using τ = 1 − T ) as an explicit example. Although the ingredients for a
N3LL resummation are currently known [11,16,40–42] (with the sole exception of the four-
loop cusp anomalous dimension), in this paper we limit ourselves to NLL for the sake of
simplicity. However our results are easily generalizable to more complicated observables
of interest as well as to the computation of higher-order corrections. We leave this to a
forthcoming publication [43].

This paper is organized as follows: We review the resummation using the branching
formalism in Section 2 and the SCET approach to resummation in Section 3. The main
part of the paper is contained in Section 4, where we discuss how to combine the two
approaches to obtain a numerical approach to resummation in SCET. Conclusions and an
outlook to future work is presented in Section 5.

2. Review of QCD resummation in the CAESAR/ARES framework

In this section we brieﬂy review how resummation is carried out in the approach of refs. [10,
13]. We begin by discussing the basic setup of the formalism for a general observable v and
to arbitrary order in the resummation, but then restrict ourselves to the speciﬁc case of the
thrust distribution when deriving the NLL result in more detail. We consider observables
that vanish in the 2-jet limit, and when considering the thrust distribution we use τ ≡ 1−T .
At Born level, the ﬁnal state consists of two back-to-back particles along the thrust
axis with center of mass energy Q. Beyond Born level, further radiation is present and the

– 4 –

ﬁnal state consists in general of n secondary emissions, k1, . . . , kn, and of the primary quark
and antiquark which recoil against these additional emissions. We denote the value of the
observable by V (ΦB; k1, . . . , kn), where the Born phase space ΦB contains the dependence
on the two Born momenta.

In order to single out the dependence on the Born phase space, we write

Σ(v) =

(cid:90)

1
σB

dΦB Σ(ΦB; v) ,

(2.1)

and we will work with the expression Σ(ΦB; v) for most of this paper. This means that the
ΦB phase space integral needs to be performed at the end, and the ﬁnal result needs to be
divided by the Born cross section σB.

In the infrared and collinear limit, Σ(ΦB; v) receives contributions from either virtual,
or soft and/or collinear real corrections. In the following, we denote by V(ΦB) the quark
form factor at all orders (see e.g. [44]). Therefore we can write

Σ(ΦB; v) = V(ΦB)

[dki]|M (ΦB; k1, . . . , kn)|2 Θ [V (ΦB; k1, . . . , kn) < v] ,

(2.2)

i=1

where M is the matrix element for n real emissions (the case with n = 0 reduces to the
Born matrix element), and [dki] denotes the phase space for the emission ki. Each matrix
element in Eq. (2.2) receives higher-order virtual corrections, while the number of real
emissions is ﬁxed by the index of the sum. The Θ function represents the measurement
function for the observable under consideration.

2.1 The simpliﬁed observable and the transfer function

The general strategy of the CAESAR/ARES approach is to write the cross section for a rIRC
safe observable v into the cross section of a simpler observable vs which has the same
logarithmic structure as v at lowest order1, and a transfer function that accounts for the
diﬀerence between the two observables v and vs. The latter is formulated in such a way
that it can be evaluated eﬃciently using Monte Carlo methods.

As we will discuss in a little while, a good choice for such a simple observable is
vs = vmax, where the simple observable is deﬁned by taking a suitably deﬁned maximum
of the observable calculated for independent emissions. We use the following notation

Σmax(ΦB; v) ≡ Σ(ΦB; vmax)

(2.3)

from now on. A detailed deﬁnition of this observable will follow shortly.

Using some trivial manipulations, one can write

Σ(ΦB; v) = Σmax(ΦB; v)

Σmax(ΦB; δv)
Σmax(ΦB; v)

Σ(ΦB; v)
Σmax(ΦB; δv)

≡ Σmax(ΦB; v) F(ΦB; v) ,

(2.4)

1This last requirement is not, strictly speaking, necessary, although it will lead to important simpliﬁca-

tions in formulating a Monte Carlo solution.

– 5 –

where we introduced the small positive parameter δ (cid:28) 1 that is independent of the observ-
able’s value v. An important comment at this stage is in order. Eq. (2.4) is strictly valid
only for observables that admit a resummed cross section of the type (1.2). This is not
the case for observables which can vanish also in the presence of resolved emissions due to
kinematic cancellations (for instance for the transverse momentum of a color singlet in pp
collisions). In this case Eq. (2.4) takes the form of a convolution between Σmax and F. In
this article we limit ourselves to observables that behave like Eq. (1.2) in the v → 0 limit,
and leave the study of the above observables for a future publication.

The product of ratios gives the relation between the cross section of the desired ob-
servable Σ(ΦB; v) and the cross section of the simpliﬁed observable Σmax(ΦB; v), and it
accounts for the exact behavior of the observable in the presence of radiation. For this
reason it is normally referred to as multiple-emissions functions. For the sake of brevity,
we have dubbed it transfer function

F(ΦB; v) ≡

Σmax(ΦB; δv)
Σmax(ΦB; v)

Σ(ΦB; v)
Σmax(ΦB; δv)

.

(2.5)

An important property of this transfer function is that it is IRC and UV ﬁnite, and
as long as Σmax(ΦB; v) has the same LL structure as Σ(ΦB; v) (as we are assuming), its
contribution starts at NLL (as will be shown later). The small parameter δ was introduced
in order to allow for the transfer function to be easily calculable in a MC framework, as we
will discuss below. The basic idea is that in the second ratio, Σ(ΦB; v)/Σmax(ΦB; δv), the
denominator removes the unresolved emissions with V < δv, such that this ratio is IRC
ﬁnite. The resulting dependence on the resolution parameter δ is cancelled against the ﬁrst
ratio, which can be calculated analytically once Σmax is known.

The ﬁrst step in computing a resummed expression for Σ(ΦB; v) is to build an explicit
logarithmic counting for the squared matrix elements. To achieve this, one introduces the
n-particle correlated (nPC) squared matrix elements | ˜M (k1, . . . , kn)|2, which are deﬁned
recursively as

| ˜M (ka)|2 =

| ˜M (ka, kb)|2 =

|M (ΦB; ka)|2
|M (ΦB)|2 ≡ |M (ka)|2 ,
|M (ΦB; ka, kb)|2
|M (ΦB)|2

− |M (ka)|2|M (kb)|2 ,

| ˜M (ka, kb, kc)|2 =

|M (ΦB; ka, kb, kc)|2
|M (ΦB)|2

− |M (ka)|2|M (kb)|2|M (kc)|2

(2.6)

− | ˜M (ka, kb)|2|M (kc)|2 − | ˜M (ka, kc)|2|M (kb)|2 − | ˜M (kb, kc)|2|M (ka)|2
. . .

These denote the parts of the squared amplitudes with n real emissions that can not
be obtained by multiplying together squared amplitudes with less than n real emissions,
and therefore represent the fully correlated part. With these deﬁnitions, the renormalized

– 6 –

where the index j denotes the order of virtual corrections to the squared amplitude with n

between the diﬀerent blocks in the decomposition (2.7), in the sense that correlated blocks
with n particles generally start contributing at one logarithmic order higher than correlated
blocks with n − 1 particles [10, 13].

Having introduced the nPC decomposition of the squared matrix elements allows one
to precisely deﬁne the simpliﬁed observable Vmax. It is deﬁned to be the maximum value
of the full observable V calculated on the sum of momenta in each correlated block. In
equations, this becomes

where ˜V (ΦB; q) denotes the functional form of the observable on a single emission. It is
important that the content of each correlated block is treated inclusively when computing
the relative ˜V so that the above deﬁnition is collinear safe and can be extended at all
orders. It is obvious that, in general, the cross section Σmax has no physical meaning, but
it simply deﬁnes one ingredient for our resummation approach.

– 7 –

It is worth stressing that one has some freedom in choosing the form of ˜V . Conceptu-
ally, the simplest choice is to set ˜V = V evaluated on the inclusive content of each block. In
general, however, the only important feature is that it shares the same leading logarithms
with the observable we are ultimately interested in. It is therefore very useful to deﬁne the
simple observable such that the corresponding Σmax can be used for a whole class of more
complicated observables. This can be achieved, for instance, by using the soft-collinear
approximation of the full observable ˜V = Vsc instead of its full form V . This indeed, be-
sides simplifying further the computation of Σmax, guarantees that this ingredient can be
directly used for the resummation of all observables that share the same soft-collinear limit
for a single emission, which deﬁnes a much broader class than the ﬁrst deﬁnition given
above. For the sake of simplicity, however, we avoid this technical complication in the rest
of this article, and refer the interested reader to refs. [10, 13] for more details.

We now continue with the derivation of the master formula. Using Eq. (2.9) together
with Eqs. (2.7) and (2.10), Σmax(ΦB; v) can be written in terms of the nPC(j) blocks. Since
the observable acts separately on each nPC block, the expression in Eq. (2.9) can easily be
shown to exponentiate. To perform a NkLL resummation for global, rIRC-safe observables,
one needs to include nPC(j) blocks with n + j ≤ k + 1, but additional simpliﬁcations might
be made on each nPC(j) block. For example, to LL accuracy, only the 1PC(0) block is
required, and one only needs to keep the soft-collinear limit of it. Thus, one obtains

(2.13)

where R(ΦB; v) is called the radiator function, and Σ0

Using the expression for Σmax(ΦB; v) obtained just above, the ﬁrst ratio in Eq. (2.5)
can easily be computed, and we give the explicit expression when deriving the results at
NLL accuracy below.

To compute the second ratio in Eq. (2.5) we need to carefully deﬁne the notion of
resolved (unresolved) momenta, by demanding that the value Vmax evaluated on the set of
momenta is above (below) a resolution scale δv

Θδv [{ki}] ≡ Θ [Vmax(ΦB; {ki}) > δv]
Θδv [{ki}] ≡ Θ [Vmax(ΦB; {ki}) < δv] .

(2.14)

– 8 –

A key point now is to notice that for δ → 0 one can neglect the unresolved real emissions in
the observable measurement function as they are much softer and/or more collinear than
any other resolved emission in the ﬁnal state. rIRC safety then guarantees that

Θ [V (ΦB; k1, . . . , kn) < v] Θδv [{k1, . . . , kl}]

= Θ [V (ΦB; kl+1, . . . , kn) < v] Θδv [{k1, . . . , kl}] + v δp ,

(2.15)

where p is a positive and real constant, independent of v. This allows one to split the total
momentum q of each nPC block in Σ(ΦB; v) into a resolved and unresolved component
(depending on whether the value of ˜V (ΦB; q) is greater or less than δv).2
Thus, for each nPC block we use

2A second comment is in order. Once again, for observables that can vanish because of kinematic
cancellations (a primary example being the transverse momentum of a color singlet in pp collisions), our
choice of the simple observable can have issues when the above cancellations occur. A more appropriate,
and more general, prescription would be to use δV (q1) as a resolution scale, where q1 is the total four
In this case Eq. (2.4) takes the form of a convolution as

sake of simplicity, since all of the other considerations made here are fully general.

Table 1: The order at which the various nPC(j) are required for the computation of Σmax(v) and

Note that the above discussion holds to any logarithmic accuracy. To go to a given
order in the resummation of Σ(v) or Σmax(v) one needs to rewrite the full matrix element
in terms of the nPC(j) blocks, and only keep the blocks that are relevant at the desired
logarithmic order.

For the two ratios required in the transfer function Eq. (2.5), the argument of the
numerator and denominator scale with the observable v. This implies that to compute the
ratio to a given logarithmic accuracy, one needs the numerator and denominator at one
logarithmic order lower [10, 13]. To understand this fact better, let us consider the ﬁrst
ratio in Eq. (2.5) as an example. At NLL order, we can write Σmax(v) = exp[Lvg1(αsLv) +
g2(αsLv)], where Lx = ln(1/x). We ﬁnd

Σmax(δv)
Σmax(v)

= exp {Lδvg1(αsLδv) − Lvg1(αsLv) + g2(αsLδv) − g2(αsLv)}

1(αsLv)(cid:3) + . . .(cid:9) ,

(2.19)

where we have dropped all terms contributing beyond NLL. One can clearly see that the
result depends only on the LL function g1(αsLv), such that each term is only required to
LL accuracy.

Furthermore, one can perform additional kinematical expansions to simplify the ex-
pressions of the nPC(j) blocks, and we decompose each block nPC(j) by singling out its
most singular (hence leading) term [nPC(j)]sc, that is obtained by taking the soft and
collinear limit of all emissions, i.e.

nPC(j) = [nPC(j)]sc + [nPC(j)](cid:26)sc.

(2.20)

In summary, the ingredients required to a given order in logarithmic counting are sum-
marized in Table 1. In the next section we perform the calculation at NLL for the thrust
event shape.

2.2 Resumming the thrust distribution to NLL accuracy

In this section we compute all ingredients necessary to obtain Σ(ΦB; τ ) for the thrust
distribution to NLL accuracy, using Eq. (2.4). The thrust distribution is an additive

For the computation of the transfer function one only needs to keep the 1PC(0) block

To compute the second ratio of the transfer function to NLL accuracy, one uses

the usual parton shower algorithm:

2. Increase i by one

4. If τi < δτ exit the algorithm, otherwise go back to step 2

If the sum over all generated τi is less than τ , accept the event, otherwise reject it. The
value of F(τ ) is equal to the fraction of the accepted events.

∆LL(ΦB ;τi,δτ ) = r

2.3 Neglecting subleading eﬀects: the CAESAR formula

The expression for the transfer function obtained in the previous section contains eﬀects
beyond NLL. It is often useful to be able to neglect all subleading eﬀects and hence have
a pure NLL answer. This can be done through a set of simpliﬁcations that we brieﬂy
summarize below. We stress that the operations performed in the present section are not,
strictly speaking, necessary, but they can simplify considerably the numerical evaluation
of the transfer function, and allow for an analytic solution in some cases.

There are two important sources of subleading corrections in the treatment presented
in the previous section. First, since the relevant squared amplitudes in the transfer function
1PC(0) are taken in the soft-collinear limit, it is natural to also approximate the observable
V in the same limit. It is convenient to parametrize the emissions’ momenta as

i p1 + z(2)
where κt,i is a space-like four-vector κt,i = (0, (cid:126)kt,i), orthogonal to the two reference momenta
p1 and p2 that are aligned with the thrust axis (cid:126)nT

i p2 + κt,i ,

ki = z(1)

(2.33)

p1 =

Q
2

(1, (cid:126)nT ) ,

p2 =

Q
2

(1, −(cid:126)nT ) .

(2.34)

Finally, we introduce the emission’s rapidity ηi with respect to the thrust axis, which is
given by

ηi =

(2.35)

where the boundary for ηi is obtained by imposing z((cid:96))

i < 1 for any leg (cid:96) = 1, 2.

Using the additivity of thrust one ﬁnds

τi ,

with

τi ≡ Vsc(ΦB; ki) =

(2.36)

The above expression for the observable can be used in the evaluation of both the Sudakov
radiator and the transfer function, neglecting terms beyond NLL order. Starting again
from ΣNLL
max , we can evaluate the integral (2.24) by parametrizing the phase space [dq] in
terms of the transverse momentum qt and rapidity η of the emission q in the centre-of-mass
frame of the emitting dipole. For the soft-collinear contribution one ﬁnds

Using the above integrals, one can express RNLL(ΦB; v) as

(2.39)

where L = ln 1
τ and the expressions of gi have been long known [9] and are summarized in
Appendix A. The derivative of the LL radiator, required in the transfer function, is then
given by

R(cid:48)

LL(ΦB; τ ) = −αsLg(cid:48)

1(αsL) − g1(αsL) .

(2.40)

The second source of subleading corrections in the formulation of Section 2.2 has to do
with the phase space bounds of the resolved radiation. In particular, we see from Eq. (2.37)
that

which is then common to all resolved emissions. In our notation, this operation amounts

where all terms in the r.h.s. beyond the ﬁrst one are logarithmically subleading (each extra
derivative suppresses the contribution by one logarithmic order). Similarly, the ﬁrst ratio

terms necessary to cancel the δ dependence of the resolved radiation

Eq. (2.45) is purely NLL, and does not contain any correction of subleading logarithmic
nature, but still has the same general form as Eq. (2.30). The algorithm to compute it
simpliﬁes considerably:

– 14 –

1. Start with i = 0 and τ0 = τ

2. Increase i by one

3. Generate τi randomly according to (τi−1/τi)−R(cid:48)

LL(ΦB;τ ) = r, with r ∈ [0, 1]

4. If τi < δτ exit the algorithm, otherwise go back to step 2

If the sum over all generated τi is less than τ , accept the event, otherwise reject it. The value
of F(v) is equal to the fraction of the accepted events. The form of the transfer function
can be manipulated further in order to make its numerical evaluation more eﬃcient by
getting rid of the Θ function in Eq. (2.46), as shown in refs. [10, 13].

There is a second advantage of using Eq. (2.46) rather than Eq. (2.30). We notice
that the starting equation (2.30) involves the function R(cid:48) (and hence the running coupling)
evaluated at scales Qτi that can get as small as Qδτ . When δ → 0 the above scale hits the
Landau pole of the theory, which requires a prescription to deal with the non-perturbative
region (e.g. a cutoﬀ or a non-perturbative model) if this equation is implemented in a
Monte Carlo method. On the other hand, the ﬁnal equation (2.46) does not have this issue
since we expanded the arguments of the couplings about Qτ (cid:29) ΛQCD, hence avoiding the
Landau pole as long as the observable τ is suﬃciently large.

For an additive observable such as thrust considered here, further manipulations are

possible to obtain an analytic solution which reads

FNLL(ΦB; τ ) =

e−γE R(cid:48)
Γ[1 + R(cid:48)

LL(ΦB;τ )
LL(ΦB; τ )]

,

which leads to the following NLL formula for the thrust cumulative distribution

3. Review of resummation in SCET

SCET [2–5] is an eﬀective ﬁeld theory of QCD constructed to capture the long distance
physics arising from soft and collinear radiation. To describe these diﬀerent types of long
distance eﬀects requires two separate types of ﬁelds in the eﬀective theory: soft and collinear
ﬁelds. All short distance physics is integrated out of the theory, and contributes only via
short distance matching coeﬃcients.

Given that SCET has several degrees of freedom and exhibits a rich gauge structure,
a detailed derivation of it is beyond the scope of this work and we refer the reader to the
original literature [2–5] for details. One important feature, however, is that by deﬁning
the collinear ﬁelds in an appropriate way [5], the SCET Lagrangian can be written in a
way that at leading power the collinear and soft degrees of freedom can be completely
separated, giving

When cutting a propagator, we replace the denominator a of the propagator with (−2πi)δ(a).

where the soft Lagrangian is identical to the full QCD Lagrangian. In the following we are
going to use the collinear fermionic Lagrangian which can be written as

(3.2)

Here ξn denotes a collinear fermion ﬁeld after a so-called BPS [5] ﬁeld redeﬁnition, and the
derivatives Dn are covariant with respect to collinear gauge transformations and therefore
only include collinear gluons ﬁelds. Note that a single collinear fermion ﬁeld ξn can be made
invariant under collinear gauge transformations by combining it with a collinear Wilson
line Wn to deﬁne

χ = W †

nξn .

(3.3)

Operators in SCET are typically constructed out these gauge invariant ﬁelds. The Feynman
rules that are obtained from the SCET Lagrangian are given in Fig. 1.

The starting point for resummation in SCET is the derivation of a factorization theo-
rem that expresses the cross section as a combination of contributions arising from three
diﬀerent singular sectors: hard, soft and collinear. Although such a type of separation is
already performed at the level of the SCET Lagrangian [4], the observable under consid-
eration mixes the various soft and collinear modes in its deﬁnition. Therefore, in order to
derive a factorization theorem one must decompose the observable into soft and collinear

– 16 –

(p, p )r(p, p )rkpp’kpcontributions [6, 7], which can be treated separately and then combined to give the ﬁnal
value of the observable. This allows for a separation between the phase space of the soft
and collinear sectors, and therefore makes the factorization manifest. A clear complication
arises for complex observables, for which the separation between soft and collinear modes
in the measurement function can become quite cumbersome.

We express a generic factorization theorem as

Σ(v) = Hn1n2(µ) Jn1(v, . . . ; µ) ⊗ Jn2(v, . . . ; µ) ⊗ Sn1n2(v, . . . ; µ) .

(3.4)

The hard function Hn1n2 only depends on the directions ni, but is independent of the ob-
servable. The jet functions describe the evolution of the radiation collinear to the directions
ni, and the soft function describes the soft interaction between the two jet functions. The
precise deﬁnition of the jet and soft functions, as well as of the convolution ⊗ in Eq. (3.4),
depend on the deﬁnition of the observable whose value is required to be less than v in the
integrated cross section Σ(v).

In this paper we will need two types of observables. The ﬁrst is the thrust observable we
intend to resum, which is an additive observable for which the total value of the observable
is the sum over the contributions from each particle. The factorization formula for such an
additive observable takes the form [45–47]

Σ(v) = Hn1n2(µ)

The two collinear directions n1 and n2 are back to back along the thrust axis t such that
n1 = n, n2 = ¯n with n = (1, ˆt), ¯n = (1, −ˆt) and n· ¯n = 2. Suppressing the dependence of
the hard and soft function on the directions n and ¯n, we write

Σ(τ ) = H(µ)

(3.6)

We will also need an expression for the simple observable used to deﬁne Σmax in the
previous section. This is deﬁned by ﬁrst grouping the various collinear and soft emissions
separately into clusters in an infrared and collinear safe manner, computing the observable
from each cluster and taking the maximum value of those. Such an observable factorizes
in a multiplicative way, such that no convolutions are required

expression of either thrust V or the simple observable Vmax as function of the ﬁnal state
momenta in the soft and collinear approximations, respectively. For notational simplicity,
from now on we will omit the trace operation as well as the 1/Nc prefactor in the color
average of the above expressions, which will be understood in the rest of this article.

3.1 Resummation via Renormalization group equations

Once a factorization theorem has been obtained, one can use the renormalization group
equations to resum the logarithmic dependence in the various contributions to the factorized
cross sections. For this to work, it is crucial that each contribution depends kinematically
on only a single scale µF . This ensures that the logarithmic dependence in each contribution
is directly tied to the dependence on the renormalization scale, since it can only occur in
the form ln(µ/µF ). It immediately follows that each contribution is free from logarithmic
dependence if one chooses µ = µF (the initial condition), and that the logarithms can be
resummed using the RG equations.

Before we discuss this in more detail, we take a short digression and discuss a feature
of SCET that will be important later. In SCET, both the physical phase space and the
observable’s measurement function are expanded out according to the scaling of soft and
collinear modes, since it ensures that each ingredient in the factorization formula depends
on only a single scale4. Written in terms of the invariants yqg = sqg/Q2 and y¯qg = s¯qg/Q2,
the matrix element squared of the real radiation behaves as 1/(yqgy¯qg), such that diver-
gences arise both in the IR (y → 0) or UV (y → ∞) limit. To understand the consequences
of this, we investigate the phase space boundary of a single emission, which are given in
full QCD as

(cid:90)

QCD :

dyqg dy¯qg Θ[min(yqg, y¯qg, 1 − yqg − y¯qg) < τ ] Θ[0 < yij < 1] ,

(3.10)

4An exception is given by some observables which require the introduction of an additional regulator
to handle the rapidity divergences, which are classiﬁed as SCETII problems [52]. In this case soft and jet
functions will generally depend on two scales. This fact does not aﬀect the treatment we present in the rest
of this article, as our ﬁnal formulation of the resummation in Section 4 equally applies to both cases.

– 18 –

where yij denotes both yqg and y¯qg. They are shown graphically in Fig 2a). Clearly, neither
of the two Mandelstam variables can exceed the physical bound set by the total energy in
the event Q2, and therefore the phase space integration over each variable is bounded from
above.

Figure 2: The regions of phase space contributing to the various pieces. In a) we show the phase
space region of full QCD, in b) that of the soft function, and in c) and d) the region of the jet
functions.

The phase space boundary of the soft function in SCET is obtained by expanding the

full QCD phase space boundary about the limit yqg, y¯qg (cid:28) 1. This gives

(cid:90)

Soft :

dyqg dy¯qg Θ[min(yqg, y¯qg) < τ ] Θ[0 < yij] ,

(3.11)

which is shown graphically in Fig 2b). This implies that the larger of the two Mandelstam
variables yqg or y¯qg is unbounded from above, leading to a UV divergence.

The ﬁrst collinear limit is obtained by taking the limit yqg (cid:28) y¯qg ∼ 1 (the second is

the same under the replacement yqg ↔ y¯qg). This gives

(cid:90)

Coll1 :

dyqg dy¯qg Θ[min(yqg, 1 − y¯qg) < τ ] Θ[0 < y¯qg < 1] Θ[0 < yqg] .

(3.12)

The collinear regions are shown by the hatched region in Fig 2 c) and d). In this case both
variables are bounded from above, just as in the case of the full theory. However, adding the
soft and collinear regions naively, leads to a double counting of the soft-collinear region [53],
which is handled in SCET by subtracting a 0-bin region from the collinear integrals, which
is nothing but the soft limit of the collinear integral. The soft limit of the ﬁrst collinear
phase space region (with the obvious replacement to the obtain the soft limit of the second
collinear phase space region) is given by

(cid:90)

0 − bin1 :

dyqg dy¯qg Θ[0 < yqg < τ ] Θ[0 < y¯qg] ,

(3.13)

such that the integral over y¯qg is again unbounded from above, leading to a UV divergence.
Diagrammatically, the 0-bin regions are summarized by the gray region in Fig. 2 c) and d).
While UV divergences are present in SCET as just discussed, each of the terms in
the factorization formula Eq. (3.5) is IRC ﬁnite. Thus all divergences are of UV origin
and are removed by renormalization. The renormalization of the UV divergences leads to
renormalization group equations (RGE) for each component. As already discussed, each

denote by µH , µJ , and µS for the hard, jet, and soft functions respectively. At these scales
no logarithms are present to any order in perturbation theory. For the thrust observable
considered in this work, the scales are [16, 47]

µH = Q ,

√

µJ = Q

τ ,

µS = Qτ .

(3.14)

The resummation in SCET is then performed by evolving the hard, soft and jet func-
tions from their characteristic scales to a common renormalization scale µ. The evolution
is simply obtained by solving the corresponding RGE. The hard function is always multi-
plicatively renormalized, giving the following evolution equation

(3.15)

The precise form of the RGE for the soft and jet function depends on the observable under
consideration. This dependence arises from the way the observable behaves in the presence
of multiple soft or collinear emissions which make up the soft and jet functions. For
instance, in the case of thrust, each new emission contributes to the observable additively,
which implies the following non-local form for the RGEs [16, 46, 47, 54, 55]

consistency condition

γH [αs(µ)] = 2γJ [αs(µ)] + γS[αs(µ)] , .

(3.20)

An analogous condition, trivially satistﬁed, holds for the terms in the anomalous dimension
proportional to Γcusp. We write the solution to the RGEs in Eqs. (3.15), (3.16) and (3.17)

The logarithmic accuracy is determined by the perturbative order with which the anoma-
lous dimensions and boundary conditions are determined. For example, to achieve LL
accuracy, one only needs Γ(1)
cusp, while for NLL accuracy Γ(n)
cusp for n ≤ 2 and γ(1)
F . For
NkLL accuracy, one needs Γ(n)

for n ≤ k and boundary condition

F (n) with n ≤ k − 1. The numerical values for Γ(1,2)
F , which are required for NLL
resummation are given in Appendix A.

cusp and γ(1)

SCET and resummation based on factorization theorems in general is extremely pow-
erful. Since higher logarithmic accuracy is achieved simply by computing anomalous di-
mensions and boundary conditions at higher perturbative accuracy, progress in our ability
to perform ﬁxed order calculations directly leads to higher logarithmic resummation, and
some of the highest logarithmic accuracy has been achieved for several observables using
this approach. The main drawback is that only observables for which a factorization theo-
rem is known can be resummed using this approach. Deriving such a factorization theorem
is often quite complicated, and for many observables it is not known.

example of Section 2.

We start with the computation of the soft function. The diagrams contributing to
the one-loop corrections are reported in Figure 3. The virtual correction is given by a
scaleless integral, and hence vanishes in dimensional regularization, allowing us to set
(cid:15)IR = (cid:15)UV = (cid:15). Conversely, the real correction (plus its conjugate) is obtained by cutting
the gluon propagator. Using the Feynman rules given in Fig 1 this gives

Next, we compute the jet function along the n direction (analogous considerations
apply to J¯n), whose one-loop corrections are given by the diagrams of Figure 4. Virtual
corrections are again given by scaleless integrals, so the only non-vanishing contribution is
obtained by cutting through the loop in the diagrams of Figure 4. The sum of the diagrams

Since the integrals above include a contribution where the momentum kµ becomes soft
(and these eﬀects have already been included in the soft function), this soft contribution
needs to be subtracted. In SCET this procedure is called zero-bin subtraction [53], but
in this case is given by scaleless integrals and hence vanishes. Combining Eqs. (3.31)
and (3.33) (after the usual MS renormalization), performing the Laplace transform and

Now Eq. (3.40) can be inverted to thrust space. One can decide to set the scales
as in Eqs. (3.30), (3.35) and perform the Laplace transform or, rather, to ﬁrst perform
the inverse Laplace transform with symbolic µS and µJ and then set the scales to µS =

Combining all results together, setting the common renormalization scale to µ = µH =

Before moving on, we report the result for Σmax(τ ), which enters as an ingredient of the
decomposition that will be used in Section 4. The simple observable used to deﬁne Σmax(τ )
is such that its UV divergences can be renormalized in a multiplicative way in thrust space,
that is, the corresponding factorization theorem is multiplicative (see Eq. (3.7)). To the
order we are working, the resulting soft and jet functions are trivially obtained from the
Laplace space results reported above by simply evaluating them directly in thrust space,
i.e.

Smax(τ ; µ) = ˜S(u = u0/τ ; µ)
J max(τ ; µ) = ˜J(u = u0/τ ; µ) .

At higher orders the initial conditions in Laplace space are diﬀerent than they are in
thrust space, such that the Eq. (4.23) is no longer exactly correct. To obtain the correct
expression requires to perform the calculation of Smax and J max directly in thrust space
according to the factorization theorem (3.7).

3.3 Neglecting subleading logarithmic eﬀects

The exact deﬁnition of the logarithmic order in resummation is somewhat convention de-
pendent, and diﬀerent prescriptions can be found in the literature. The prescription given
in the previous section in Eq. (3.47) includes in fact various subleading logarithmic terms.
For example, the cusp anomalous dimensions at 2-loop order is only required for the con-
tribution in the ﬁrst line of Eqs. (3.16) and (3.17), while in the second line it is enough to
include the cusp anomalous dimension at 1-loop order. This implies that, instead of using
the full expression for η ≡ 2ηj + ηs in the term e−γE η/Γ(1 + η), one can perform a Taylor
expansion of this result. For example, to NNLL accuracy one has

e−γE ηNNLL

Also, in general one ﬁnds diﬀerences depending on how the RG equations are solved.
As already mentioned, performing resummation to a given order in Laplace space and then
inverting the Laplace transform, gives results that diﬀer beyond the order one is working
compared to solving the RG equations directly in thrust space. A second example is that
resumming the thrust distribution dσ/dτ (cid:48) (by setting the scales to the characteristic scales
of the distribution) and then computing Σ(τ ) by integrating over 0 < τ (cid:48) < τ yields results
that again diﬀer at higher logarithmic order from those obtained by directly resumming the
distribution Σ(τ ). For a detailed discussion of diﬀerences in logarithmic counting, see [56].
This existence of diﬀerent conventions needs to be kept in mind in the next section
when comparing the results obtained from an automated SCET resummation with the
analytical results. In particular, a consistent comparison between diﬀerent approaches can
be only performed up to formally subleading terms.

4. Automated resummation in SCET

The starting equation for the automated resummation in Section 2 was the separation of
the desired cross section Σ(v) into the product of the simpliﬁed cross section Σmax(v) and
the transfer function F(v) given in Eq. (2.5). The resummation of the simpliﬁed observable
was computed analytically, while the transfer function could be obtained numerically. In
this section we derive a similar result, but where all ingredients are deﬁned within SCET.
To simplify the discussion, we consider here a factorizable observable (such as thrust)
and perform a similar decomposition at the level of the individual soft and jet functions.
The SCET factorization theorem (3.5) for the thrust event shape that can be recast as

The goal is to compute each of the transfer functions through a MC algorithm deﬁned
uniquely in terms of either soft or collinear ﬁelds, in a way that is similar to Section 2.
We will show in Section 4.2 that in the framework of SCET one can compute each of the
transfer functions FJ (τn, τ, µ) and FS(τs, τ, µ) through a separate MC. This ensures that
all observable dependence is restricted to the numerical MC algorithm.

The computation of Eqs. (4.4) via MC methods requires that each can be obtained in
4 dimensions by recursively computing real emissions. This relies on two important facts:
First, the transfer function has to be determined entirely through the real radiation, and
second, each contribution needs to be ﬁnite in 4 dimensions. The ﬁrst fact is trivially
satisﬁed, since in the ratios ΣF (τ )/Σmax
(δτ ) the purely virtual corrections cancel exactly.
The second requirement deserves some closer investigation.

F

The IRC divergences cancel quite trivially in the ratio ΣF (τ )/Σmax

(δτ ), since the nu-
merator and denominator include the same unresolved real radiation (for rIRC safe observ-
ables). However, as we discussed in Section 3.1 and contrary to full QCD, in the standard

F

– 28 –

formulation of SCET real radiation is UV divergent. The resulting UV divergences of the
real radiation appear both in the soft and in the jet functions and they cancel entirely
only in their combination to give the physical cross section. The existence of the above
divergences is a feature of the eﬀective theory formulation in which the UV bounds of the
theory are completely integrated out into Wilson coeﬃcients. This guarantees that each of
the soft and jet functions only depends on a single characteristic scale, which allows for the
resummation of the dominant logarithmic terms via RG equations. In the usual formula-
tion of SCET the UV divergences from the real radiation are regulated using dimensional
regularization, and they constitute a crucial contribution to the anomalous dimensions
which resummation is based on. However, the presence of the additional UV divergences
prohibits a MC formulation of the problem that requires the phase-space integrals of the
real radiation to be computable in 4 dimensions.

We solve this problem by introducing an explicit UV regulator for real phase space
integrals into SCET. In this formulation of SCET, the UV divergences from virtual dia-
grams are regulated in dimensional regularization, just as before, while those from the real
radiation are regulated with an alternative regulator, which can be chosen to be either a
physical cutoﬀ or an analytic regulator. This will give rise to a diﬀerent RG structure in
SCET, resulting in diﬀerent logarithmic structures for the soft and jet functions individ-
ually. However, when soft and jet functions are combined into physical observables, one
reproduces the same result as in the standard SCET formulation. By introducing such a
regulator, we make sure that the UV divergences in the real radiation are now regulated in 4
dimensions, hence allowing for a formulation of the resummation through a MC algorithm.
In Section 4.1 we discuss the standard resummation in SCET in the presence of this new
UV regulator for real-emission phase space integrals. We perform an explicit computation
of the relevant soft and jet functions at one loop, and we show how the resummation
can be performed through RG evolution. In Section 4.2 we show how to formulate a MC
solution to the corresponding RG equations. We brieﬂy comment on the extension to other
observables in the conclusions, while the detailed generalization will be treated in a future
publication. An alternative interpretation of the results presented in this section in the
context of SCET is reported in Appendix C, where we comment on the structure of the
theory when a IRC regulator δτ is included.

4.1 SCET with a UV regulator for real radiation

In this section we perform the calculation of the one-loop soft and jet functions by using
an additional UV regulator for the phase-space integrals of the real radiation. This can be
compared directly with Section 3.2, where the same calculations were performed without
the additional UV regulator. The infrared and collinear divergences, as well as the UV
divergences of the virtual corrections, are regularized by conventional dimensional regular-
ization as before. One has some freedom in choosing the form of the UV regulator. In
what follows we employ a cutoﬀ Λ on the light-cone components of the emissions’ momenta
which is assumed to be larger than any other scale in the problem, which implies

Λ ≥ Q .

(4.6)

– 29 –

This mimics what happens in the full theory where the upper bound is set by the center-
of-mass energy of the reaction. As a cross check, we have performed the calculations shown
below using the exponential regulator proposed in Ref. [57], and found analogous results.
As we will see, introducing this new regulator moves UV divergences between the soft
and the jet functions, but of course does not aﬀect the result after soft and jet functions
have been combined into the total cross section. Since the UV divergences determine the
RG equations, and therefore the logarithmic structure, this also implies that logarithmic
contributions are moved between the soft and the jet functions. That is of course not a
problem, since the separation into the logarithms of contributions from the various ingre-
dients of the factorization theorem is to some extent arbitrary. Even in standard SCET
one can move contributions between the diﬀerent ingredients by changing the choice of the
common renormalization scale µ.

4.1.1 The soft and jet functions at one loop

Consider the soft function of the factorization theorem given in Eq. (3.5) or Eq. (3.7). As
before, the virtual contribution (plus its conjugate) is given by

S(V)
bare(τs; µ) = −2g2

s CF n · ¯nµ2(cid:15)

(cid:90) ddk
(2π)d

k2 δ(τs) = 0 .

(4.7)

This integral is scaleless and therefore vanishes, hence setting (cid:15)UV = (cid:15)IR.

The real contribution to the soft function is obtained by cutting the gluon propagator
and imposing that the contribution to thrust from the real emission is smaller than τs.
This gives (remember that we impose k+, k− < Λ)

Sbare(τs; µ, Λ) = δ(τs) + 2g2

Next, we consider the jet function along the direction nµ. The virtual contribution is
again scaleless (also for the zero-bin subtraction) and thus vanishes, so the only non-zero
contribution is obtained from the real radiation. The collinear diagrams are unaﬀected by
the extra UV regulator, since their integrals are cut oﬀ by the scale Q. Thus, we ﬁnd the
same result as in Eq. (3.34), which we repeat here for convenience

(4.14)

By combining the soft function Eq. (4.9) and two jet functions (Eq. (4.13) plus the
analogous contribution for the direction ¯nµ) one sees that the dependence on the cutoﬀ Λ
cancels, and that the result coincides with the usual SCET result obtained in pure dimen-
sional regularization. The new regularization scheme that we have introduced, therefore,
only changes the expression of the soft and jet function while leaving their combination in
the physical cross section unchanged.

One can now proceed to write the RG equations for the soft and jet function. Since
there are now two scales characterizing the UV structure of the theory, one needs to write

– 31 –

two separate evolution equations for each subprocess, the ﬁrst of which describes the evolu-
tion in the dimensional regularization scale µ and the second one describes the dependence
on the UV cutoﬀ Λ. This is in spirit similar to what happens in SCETII problems [52]
where a rapidity regulator is introduced to regularize the additional UV divergence of the
real radiation [53, 57–61]. In fact, the same conclusions that follow would apply in that
case. One ﬁnds for the soft and jet functions5

with F = S, J .

(4.16)

From the system of equations (4.15) one can easily see that the Λ dependence cancels in
the combination of the soft and two jet functions at a given µ.

One can now solve the RG equations by evolving the jet and soft functions simulta-
neously from their characteristic scales in µ and Λ to a common scale. Since the order of
taking the derivatives with respect to ln µ and ln Λ commutes, this evolution is independent
of the path chosen in the 2-dimensional µ − Λ plane. We can therefore write the evolution
kernels relating the soft and jet functions at the characteristic scales µF and ΛF to the
common scales µ and Λ as

From Eq. (4.20) we observe that the evolution of the jet function now starts at NLL.
All double logarithms are entirely contained in the soft function, contrary to the case of

standard SCET, where both the soft and jet function contained double logarithmic terms
when evolved to the hard scale. However, as shown in Appendix B once the soft and
jet functions are combined into a physical cross section, the logarithmic terms in the two
formulations of SCET agree to all orders in perturbation theory, and one reproduces again
the result given in Eq. (3.46). The logarithmic structure of the soft and jet radiation in
this formulation of SCET reproduce exactly the physical structure in full QCD, allowing
us to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the two formulations. Notably, this
makes it possible to formulate the resummation in SCET via a Monte-Carlo approach, as
it will be described in the next section.

4.2 Monte-Carlo resummation of the transfer functions at NLL

Using the decomposition in Eqs. (4.1) and (4.4), we ﬁrst consider the soft transfer function.
We start from the deﬁnition of the thrust soft function as the following expectation value

S(τs, µ) =

(cid:88)

|k(cid:105)

|(cid:104)k|Yn ¯Y¯n|0(cid:105)|2δ(τs − Vsoft(pn, p¯n)),

(4.22)

|k(cid:105) = |k1(cid:105)
where |k(cid:105) denotes a generic state with a ﬁxed number of soft particles, e.g.
for a single real emission, |k(cid:105) = |k1, k2(cid:105) for two real emissions and so on. In Eq. (4.22),
Vsoft(pn, p¯n) denotes the expression of thrust in the soft limit, and pn (p¯n) denotes the sum
of the momenta of the soft particles in the n (¯n) hemisphere. Our goal is to use Eq. (4.22)
such that the soft transfer function FS(τ, τs, µ) required in Eq. (4.5) can be computed via
a MC algorithm.

The ﬁrst ingredient to evaluate Eq. (4.3) for the soft function is Σmax

. To the order we
are working, the result for Σmax both for soft (jet) function is trivially obtained from the
Laplace space results reported in the previous section by simply evaluating the soft (jet)
function with the Λ regulator directly in thrust space, i.e.

S

Smax(τ ; µ, Λ) = ˜S(u = u0/τ ; µ, Λ)
J max(τ ; µ, Λ) = ˜J(u = u0/τ ; µ, Λ) .

(4.23)

At higher orders the initial conditions in Laplace space are diﬀerent than they are in thrust
space, such that the Eq. (4.23) is no longer exactly correct. To obtain the correct expression
requires to perform the calculation of Smax and J max directly in thrust space according to
the factorization theorem (3.7) with the additional UV regulator Λ. Eq. (4.23) leads to

S

S

(δτ, µ)/Σmax

The ﬁrst ingredient is the ratio Σmax
(τ, µ), which is obtained using Eq. (4.24).
Since the leading logarithms cancel in the ratio of the Σmax
(δτ ) and Σmax
(τ ), one needs
the resummed expression only to LL, which is given by Eq. (4.24) where only the one-loop
cusp anomalous dimension is considered.
The second ratio ΣS(τs)/Σmax

(δτ ) can be now computed numerically, as it is both IRC
and UV ﬁnite. Indeed, the UV ﬁniteness is guaranteed by the presence of the cutoﬀ Λ in
the real radiation, while the IRC ﬁniteness is due to the rIRC safety of the observable that
ensures that the radiation below the resolution scale δτ cancels out completely in the ratio.
To achieve this, we introduce the decomposition for the squared amplitude in Eq. (4.22),
similar to what was done in Section 2

S

S

|MS(k1)|2 = |(cid:104)k1|Yn ¯Y¯n|0(cid:105)|2,

| ˜MS(k1, k2)|2 = |(cid:104)k1, k2|Yn ¯Y¯n|0(cid:105)|2 − |MS(k1)|2|MS(k2)|2,

| ˜MS(k1, k2, k3)|2 = |(cid:104)k1, k2, k3|Yn ¯Y¯n|0(cid:105)|2 − | ˜MS(k1, k2)|2|MS(k3)|2 − | ˜MS(k3, k1)|2|MS(k2)|2

− | ˜MS(k2, k3)|2|MS(k1)|2 − |MS(k1)|2|MS(k2)|2|MS(k3)|2,

. . .

(4.26)

We recall that the reason for the above decomposition is that squared amplitudes ˜MS with n
correlated real emissions start contributing at Nn−1LL to the evolution of the soft function
for all rIRC safe observables. Using SCET with a UV regulator for the real emissions, as
discussed in Section 4.1, these are now in clear correspondence with the QCD counterparts
discussed in Section 2. Just as before, each of the squared amplitudes in the r.h.s. of
Eq. (4.26) admits a perturbative expansion in powers of αs due to virtual corrections

The notation nPCS in Eq. (4.26) denotes the soft n-particle correlated blocks. In order to
compute the transfer function to NLL accuracy, we only require the 1PC(0)
S block, or in
other words the squared amplitude |MS(k1)|2 at tree level.

Putting all this together one ﬁnds

which can be evaluated with the same MC algorithm described in Section 2.2.

Next we consider the jet function. As for the soft function, the expression for Σmax

is immediately obtained from the results of Section 4.1.1 [see Eq. (4.23)]

(4.29)

The computation of the jet transfer function is trivial at NLL order. As we have seen in
Section 4.1.1, the jet function is only single logarithmic once the additional UV regulator
Λ has been introduced, since the only kinematic region of phase space giving rise to large

– 34 –

J

logarithms is of hard-collinear origin. Given that the collinear sensitivity is the same in
ΣJ (v) and Σmax
(v), the resulting logarithmic dependence due to the phase space bounds
cancels in their ratio, and the only logarithmic sensitivity in the jet transfer function
comes from the running coupling constant. This implies that each additional emission is
suppressed by an additional power of αs, such that only a ﬁnite number of emissions need
to be taken into account at a given order NkLL. In particular, to NLL accuracy, the jet
transfer function does not contribute for the reasons stated above, and one has the trivial
result

F NLL
Jn

(τn, τ, Q) = Θ[τn > 0] .

(4.30)

We can now combine the result for the two jet functions just computed with the NLL

Using the same steps as in Section 2, one can neglect terms that only contribute to

4. If τi < δτ exit the algorithm, otherwise go back to step 2

If the sum over all generated τi are less than τ , accept the event, otherwise reject it. The
value of F NLL

(τ, τ, Q) is equal to the fraction of the accepted events.

One can compare the result obtained in Eq. (4.31) using the MC algorithm above
to determine the transfer function F NLL
(τ, τ, Q) to the analytical expression, given in
Eq. (3.46). We show this comparison in Figure. 5, where we observe a perfect agreement
between the two predictions.

Figure 5: The left ﬁgure shows the thrust cross section at NLL obtained with the Monte-Carlo
algorithm given in the text (crosses in the plot). The analytic result is reported as a solid line
for comparison. The right plot reports the comparison between numerical and analytical solutions
for the soft transfer function at the same order. The numerical results have been obtained with
ln(δ) = −20.

Although the extension to the general case is beyond the scope of this article, we do
want to mention that it is possible to apply the above method to a more complicated
observable than thrust.
In general, if one is able to ﬁnd an SCET Lagrangian for the
simple observable and deﬁne Σmax which by deﬁnition contains the same LL as the full
observable v, then the resummation for v can be obtained by means of a transfer function
that is deﬁned in terms of the ﬁelds of the same Lagrangian, and can be computed via
Monte Carlo methods.

5. Conclusions and Outlook

In this work we have shown how to formulate a numerical approach to resummation in
SCET using the example of NLL resummation of the thrust distribution. This was achieved
by combining the automated CAESAR/ARES approach to resummation with the factorization
of the long distance degrees of freedom in SCET.

that a process independent hard function (H) multiplies the convolution over jet (J) and
soft (S) functions

Σ(τ ) = H J ⊗ J ⊗ S .

(5.1)

The jet and soft functions describe the long distance physics of the process and therefore
contain all observable dependence. Each of the factorization ingredients depend on only
a single scale, and logarithms can be resummed by solving RG equations for each of the
factorization ingredients separately. This general approach makes resummation relatively
straightforward once the appropriate factorization formula has been obtained, and simply
requires the computation of anomalous dimensions at a given order in perturbation theory.
In the numerical approach introduced in this paper, we identify a simpliﬁed observable,
which has the same leading logarithmic structure as the thrust distribution, and for which a
factorization theorem can be built in SCET. This simpliﬁed (max) observable is constructed
such that it has a very simple multiplicative factorization theorem, which is just the product
of the same hard function (H) multiplied by jet (J max) and soft (Smax) functions

Σmax(τ ) = H J max J max Smax .

(5.2)

Due to this simple multiplicative form of the factorization theorem, resummation is achieved
in a straightforward manner by solving multiplicative renormalization group equations. The
ratio between the full and simpliﬁed jet and soft functions deﬁnes a transfer function

FF ≡

F
F max ,

(5.3)

where F = J, S. The main result of this work was to show how to compute this transfer
function by performing the phase space integration over real emission diagrams to all orders
in perturbation theory. To NLL accuracy, this was shown to result in a rather simple
expression, which can be numerically implemented into a straightforward MC algorithm.
In order to compute the phase space integrals numerically, we needed to ensure that
they are ﬁnite in 4 dimensions. This is not the case in regular SCET, where the multipole
expansion of the phase space limits of the soft function (and the 0-bin of the jet functions)
leads to UV divergences in the real integration. In order to overcome this, we introduced
an additional regulator to control the UV divergences in the soft real phase space integra-
tions. While this modiﬁes the UV structure of the theory, and requires to perform the RG
evolution in two diﬀerent variables, we showed that the results obtained in SCET with and
without this extra regulator are in fact equivalent.

While we have focused for simplicity only on the NLL resummation of the thrust
distribution, our results are very general and are readily extended to higher orders in
resummation accuracy and to more general observables as long as one can ﬁnd a simple
observable that has the same LL as the full observable, and it is factorizable in SCET.
Using the general deﬁnition of Σmax given in this article, this is an almost trivial task
In the approach discussed in this paper, the degrees of freedom
for most observables.

– 37 –

required, and hence the eﬀective Lagrangian, are determined by the simple observable
which can be resummed analytically through a factorization theorem. The required transfer
function, that relates the simple observable to the desired observable, can then be computed
numerically using the Feynman rules of the above Lagrangian. Moreover, owing to the fact
that the UV limit is now separately regularized, SCETII problems can be formulated exactly
on the same footing as SCETI ones.

Higher-logarithmic accuracy can be obtained in a relatively straightforward manner
by keeping subleading terms in the expansions performed in this work. Furthermore,
the numerical approach to resummation in SCET applies even to observables for which a
factorization theorem is not known. This opens the door to a systematic resummation for
a wide class of observables by combining the analytical power of SCET with numerical MC
integrations, which can be automated in an algorithmic way. The details of the general
formulation are discussed in a forthcoming paper [43].

Here we have chosen the common renormalization scale to be µ = µH , such that we need
to include the RG evolution of the jet function from µJ to µH (given by the ﬁrst line) and
the RG evolution of the soft function from µS to µH (given by the second line). Taking
the inverse Laplace transform and dropping the matching coeﬃcients, one reproduces the
result given in Eq. (3.46).

In SCET with an explicit regulator for the UV divergences in real radiation one ﬁnds

ΛJ = ΛH = Q .

(B.4)

(B.5)

In the evolution Kernels ˜U (Λ)
F (u; µH , ΛH , µF , ΛF ) one has to evolve both µ and Λ from
their characteristic scale to the corresponding hard scale. Since the derivatives in Λ and µ
commute, one can choose any path in this 2-dimensional evolution, and we choose here to
ﬁrst evolve in Λ from ΛF to ΛH holding µ ﬁxed at µF , and then evolve in µ from µF to
µH holding Λ ﬁxed at ΛH . This allows us to write

˜US(u; µH , ΛH , µS, ΛS) ≡ ˜U (µ)
˜UJ (u; µH , ΛH , µJ , ΛJ ) ≡ ˜U (µ)

C. RGE of the thrust soft function with a IRC resolution scale

In this appendix we wish to comment more on the logarithmic structure of the decompo-
sition (4.5) for the resummed cross section. It is instructive to consider the soft function
as a case study, although the same conclusions apply to the two jet functions. We express
the soft function as in Eq. (4.3), namely

S(τs; µ) =

dΣS(τs)
dτs

ΣS(τs, µ) ≡ Σmax

S

(τ, µ)FS(τs, τ, µ) = Σmax

(C.1)

S

In this paper we have shown how Σmax
is computed analytically, while the transfer function
FS is obtained via MC methods. The latter task requires the introduction of an explicit UV
regulator in the theory, which led to the results in Section 4.2. The goal of this appendix
is to study how the decomposition (C.1) modiﬁes the soft function’s RGE if it were used
in the standard SCET formulation, i.e. without the Λ cutoﬀ. This is a useful exercise to
understand from a diﬀerent viewpoint the method proposed in this article.

We start by simplifying, without lost of generality, Eq. (C.1) by getting rid of the
(τ, µ) factor and recast it as

Σmax

S(τs; µ) = Σmax

The full soft function for thrust in momentum space fulﬁlls the non-local RGE [see Eqs. (3.16)
and (3.17)]

(C.3)

where the precise observable dependence (in particular its additive nature) is reﬂected in
the second term in the right-hand-side of the above equation, that essentially shows how an
extra real emission modiﬁes the existing value of the observable (i.e. in an additive way).

– 41 –

Now we study how the RGE is modiﬁed by the introduction of the IR resolution scale
(δτ, µ), which fulﬁlls the following local RG

δτs. We ﬁrst consider the contribution Σmax
equation in momentum space [see Eqs. (3.19) and (4.23)]

(C.4)

which can be easily solved by setting the initial conditions at µ = δτ Q.

Next we consider the remaining ratio Σ(cid:48)

S(τs, µ)/Σmax

(δτ, µ) which, by means of Eqs. (C.3)

and (C.4), fulﬁlls the non-local RGE

(C.8)

Thus, the decomposition of (C.1) allowed us to separate the initial evolution equation into
a local piece (C.4) and a non-local piece (C.8). The precise deﬁnition of the non-local
piece depends on the form of the observable, and the result given here holds for an additive
observable. The decomposition of Eq. (C.1) allows to separate the RGE into a local piece,
which is independent of the deﬁnition of the observable and can therefore easily be solved
analytically, and a purely non-local piece, which contains all the observable dependence.

While we have discussed how to compute the non-local piece via a MC algorithm, for
an additive observable it can easily be calculated analytically, as we now show. We take
the Laplace transform L of the ratio deﬁned as

with u0 = e−γE . The above anomalous dimension can be easily obtained from an explicit
calculation of the soft function by ﬁxing the thrust value to τs, while requiring that it be
larger than δτ . The solution to Eq. (C.10) reads

where

The solution in momentum space can be obtained by performing the inverse Laplace trans-
form which, at NLL, yields

order we set γs = 0)

S(τs; µ) = exp

By writing the logarithm in the exponential function as ln δτ Q

µ(cid:48) = ln τsQ
