Abstract  In  the  present  work,  a  thin  film  was  deposited  on  quartz  substrate  by  reactive  RF 
magnetron  sputtering  of  high  purity  (99.999%)  aluminium  target  using  ultra-high  pure  (Ar  +  N2) 
gas mixture. The percentage ratio of Ar and N2 in the gas mixture was 95% and 5%, respectively. 
Chemical characterization using  x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  (XPS) and energy-dispersive x-
ray  (EDX)  spectroscopy  reveals  that  in  the  presence  of  dilute  nitrogen,  Al  prefers  to  react  with 
residual oxygen to  form  Al2O3 while the nitrogen is  incorporated in  it.  The stoichiometry of bulk 
film is Al2N0.38O3.1. Magnetic and electrical properties measurement shows that the film exhibits n-
type dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) property at 300K. The film has low electrical resistivity 
of  6.3  Ω-cm  and  high  carrier  mobility  of  5.7×106  cm2V-1s-1  at  300K.  A  density  functional  theory 
(DFT) calculation was performed to investigate the origin of observed magnetism in the film. From 
first-principles  calculation  based  on  DFT,  it  is  found  that  for  thermodynamic  stability  dilute 
nitrogen  incorporated  in  Al2O3  preferred  to  sit  at  the  interstitial  site,  which  is  responsible  for 
observed  magnetic  property.  Present  study  reported  here  provides  a  new  insight  to  prepare  rarely 
observed n-type DMS at room temperature by incorporating nitrogen interstitials in Al2O3, which is 
desirable for potential application in the field of spintronics.

1.  Introduction- 

For the emerging field of spintronics, it is essential to develop semiconductors with ferromagnetically 
polarized carriers at room temperature (RT) such that the spin along with charge of the carriers can 
be coupled with an external magnetic field to  control functionalities of devices.[1] Dilute magnetic 
semiconductors  (DMS)  are  one  of    the  promising  candidates  to  the  emerging  field  of  spintronics. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among  many,  one  of  the  desirable  candidates  for  application  as  DMS  is  aluminium  nitride  (AlN). 
Few  studies  have  been  carried  out  to  investigate  RT  ferromagnetism  in  AlN  by  incorporating 
magnetic or nonmagnetic elements  [2,3]. However, no  clear picture  about  origin of magnetism has 
emerged yet. Various possible reasons for the origin of ferromagnetism are reported in the literature, 
which includes aluminium vacancies as well as nitrogen vacancies. [4,5]. Furthermore, when AlN is 
deposited using reactive sputtering of the aluminium target with a mixture of Ar and N2 gas, there is 
always  a  possibility  of  the  presence  of  residual  oxygen,  which  also  reacts  with  the  aluminium  and 
results  in  the  formation  of  AlNO  alloy  in  the  film.  It  is  expected  that  AlNO  alloy  should  have 
properties between pure AlN and Al2O3 i.e. exhibit high-temperature transmittance, high resistivity, 
variable refractive indices, and high bandgap energy depending upon oxygen and nitrogen content in 
the film [6]. The amount of oxygen present in the film depends on various factors like Ar:N2 ratio, 
purity of Ar and N2 gases, base vacuum, process pressure, etc. and in practice, it is almost impossible 
to get rid of oxygen entirely in the film. In literature, it is reported that the concentration of oxygen in 
the  film  decreases  with  increasing  nitrogen  ratio  in  Ar:N2  gas  mixture  used  for  reactive  sputtering 
during  deposition  [7].  Therefore,  the  film  will  consists  of  higher  oxygen  concentration  when 
deposited in a dilute nitrogen environment. In literature systematic investigation has been carried out 
to understand the effect  of oxygen on microstructure, chemical,  optical and electronic properties of 
AlN  deposited  at  higher  nitrogen  concentrations  (50%)  [7].  However,  no  such  studies  have  been 
carried out on films deposited in dilute nitrogen environment (~  10%).  Furthermore, the effect of 
oxygen concentration on magnetic properties of AlN film has not been reported so far. Present work 
is motivated by the idea to study the effect of residual oxygen on microstructure, chemical, electronic 
and  magnetic  properties  of  AlN  film  during  reactive  sputter  deposition  in  a  dilute  nitrogen 
environment. 

2. Experimental details 

A  thin  film  was  deposited  at  room  temperature  on  quartz  substrate  by  reactive  RF  magnetron 
sputtering of high purity (99.999%) aluminium target using ultra-high pure (Ar + N2) gas mixture. 
The  percentage  ratio  of  Ar  and  N2  in  the  gas  mixture  was  95%  and  5%,  respectively.  The  base 
pressure in the deposition chamber was 1.210-6 mbar. The process pressure during the deposition 
of the film was kept at 3.510-2 mbar. The substrate to target distance was fixed at 75 mm. The film 
was  deposited  for  60  min.  The  substrate  was  rotated  at  a  speed  of  10  rpm  during  deposition  to 
obtain a homogeneous film. The RF power of the magnetron sputter gun was fixed at 200W during 
the deposition of the film. The thickness of the deposited film is 37 nm measured using a surface 
profilometer. 

Microstructural characterization of the as-deposited film was carried out by Grazing Incident X-
Ray Diffraction (GIXRD) measurement at  a fixed incident  angle of 0.3  degree using M/S Bruker 
D8 Discover instrument  with  4.5 kW Cu Kα rotating anode as  an X-ray source. To determine the 
surface  chemical  composition  of  the  as-deposited  film,  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS) 
measurement was carried out in commercial monochromatic XPS instrument (M/S SPECS Surface 
Nano Analysis GmbH, Germany). The XPS data has been recorded using a monochromatic X-ray 
source  of  aluminium  with  Kα  =  1486.61  eV  operated  at  13  kV  and  100W.  XPS  data  had  been 
acquired after pre sputtering the film surface for 5 min using 500 eV Ar+ ions. The charge corrected 
XPS spectra after Shirley background subtraction were fitted with Gaussian Lorentzian line shapes. 
To  determine  the  chemical  composition  of  bulk  thin  film,  EDX  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in 
Helios NanoLab™ 600i instrument (M/s FEI Quanta, Switzerland) equipped with an EDS detector 

 
from  EDAX/AMETEK.  Resistivity  and  Hall  measurements  were  carried  out  using  the  four-probe 
method  in  a  commercial  15T  cryogen-free  measurement  system  (CFMS  15)  from  M/s  Cryogenic 
Ltd., UK. Four contacts were made in the film following Van der Pauw geometry using copper wire 
and highly conductive silver paste. Keithley DC source meter (model 2400) was used as a current 
source.  Keithley  nano  voltmeter  (model  2182A)  was  used  to  measure  the  corresponding  drop  in 
voltage. Resistivity measurement was carried out at fixed current 1×10-7 A. Hall measurement was 
carried  out  at  300K  using  1×10-6  A  fixed  current  and  sweeping  the  applied  magnetic  field 
perpendicular  to  film  surface  between  ±4T.  Magnetic  measurement  of  the  film  was  carried  out 
using  commercial  SQUID-VSM  MPMS  system  from  M/s  Quantum  Design,  USA.  For  magnetic 
measurement, the magnetic moment (m) of the bare quartz substrate is first measured at 300K as a 
function  of  the  applied  magnetic  field  (H)  by  sweeping  the  field  in  the  range  between  ±  5T.  The 
magnetic field was applied parallel to the film surface. The measured m(H) graph of the bare quartz 
substrate exhibits a diamagnetic signal. After that film is deposited in the same quartz substrate and 
m(H) was measured again for the film plus substrate at 300K in similar steps used to measure bare 
quartz  substrate.  Finally,  the  m(H)  of  the  bare  film  is  obtained  by  subtracting  the  corresponding 
moment  of  the  bare  quartz  substrate.  In  order  to  avoid  magnetic  contamination  non-magnetic 
tweezer was used to handle the sample. 

3.  Results and Discussion 

3.1 Structural characterization 

Microstructural  characterization  of  the  as-deposited  film  carried  out  by  GIXRD  measurement  is 
shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  GIXRD  graph  shows  no  clear  Bragg  peak  indicating  that  the  film  is 
amorphous in nature. 

3.2 Chemical characterization 

To find the chemical composition close to the surface of the film XPS measurement was carried out 
on as-deposited film after 5 min pre-sputtering with the Ar ion. The fitted XPS spectra of Al 2p, N 
1s, and O 1s are shown  in  Fig.  2  (a), (b)  and (c), respectively. N 1s spectrum is  well fitted with 
three  peaks  corresponding  to  N+1,  N+2,  and  N+3  oxidation  states.  The  absence  of  a  peak 
corresponding to the N-3 oxidation state ruled out the presence of AlN in the film. Similarly, both Al 
2p and O 1s spectra get fitted using only two prominent peaks corresponding to Al2O3 and Al-O-N, 
which again confirms the absence of AlN in the film.  The relative concentration of Al, N, and O at 
film surface was obtained using fitted peak area of Al 2p, N 1s and O 1s spectra, respectively after 
normalization with relative sensitivity factor (RSF) { RSFAl2p = 0.11, RSFO1s = 0.63, RSFN1s = 
0.38} [8]. The Al, N, and O concentration obtained at the film surface is approximately 41%, 1%, 
and 58% respectively. Hence, the film surface has a chemical stoichiometry of Al2N0.05 O2.8, which 
is  very  close  to  Al2O3  with  dilute  nitrogen  incorporated  in  it.  Furthermore,  Energy  Dispersive  X-
Ray [EDX] analysis was carried out  to  determine the composition  of the bulk  thin film,  which is 
shown  in  Fig.  2(d).  The  relative  concentration  of  Al,  N  &  O  in  bulk  film  obtained  from  EDX  is 
approximately  37%,  7%,  and  57%  respectively  and  hence  the  stoichiometry  of  bulk  film  is 
Al2N0.38O3.1, which is also very close to the stoichiometry of the film at the surface obtained from 
XPS. Thus, from XPS and EDX analysis it is concluded that the whole film consists of Al2O3 with 
dilute nitrogen incorporated in it. The amount of nitrogen incorporated in Al2O3 in the bulk film is 
higher (~7%) than that at close to the surface (~1%). 

 
 
In an earlier microstructure study of AlNxOy thin films, it was observed that when the concentration 
ratio of non-metallic to metallic elements (CN+O/CAl) is equal to 0.85 or more, the system becomes 
amorphous [9]. In the present case, the ratio of CN+O/CAl in the film varies between 1.4 to 1.7 from 
the  surface  to  bulk,  which  explains  the  reason  for  the  amorphous  nature  of  film  confirmed  from 
GIXRD measurement.     

3.3 Electrical transport measurement 

The sheet resistance of the film was measured as a function of temperature (T) using the Van der 
Pauw four-probe method [10]. The sheet resistivity ρs was calculated using the following expression

Where RS is the sheet resistance, Rʹ & Rʺ is resistance measured in horizontal and vertical direction 
respectively, f (Rʹ/Rʺ) is Van der Pauw correction factor and t is the thickness of the deposited film. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  3(a)  resistivity  of  the  film  increases  with  decreasing  temperature  indicating  the 
semiconducting nature. At room temperature (300K), the film exhibits low electrical resistivity of 
6.3 Ω-cm [9]. Furthermore, hall measurement was carried out at 300K. The variation in hall voltage 
(VH) as a function of the external applied field (B) is shown in Fig. 3(b). The slope between VH & B 
is negative indicating electrons as majority carriers and film behaves as n-type semiconductors. The 
majority carrier concentration was calculated from the slope using the following expression: 

                                                    𝒏𝒔 = ⁡

Where I is applied current and q is charge of the electron. The majority carrier concentration in the 
film  at  300K  calculated  using  equation  (3)  is  (1.7  ±  0.04)1011  cm-3,  which  is  several  orders  of 
magnitude  less  than  that  observed  in  the  conventional  semiconductors.  The  low  carrier 
concentration can be attributed due to dilute nitrogen sites incorporated in Al2O3 responsible for n-
type majority carriers. 
The mobility (μ) of the majority carriers at 300K is calculated using the following expression. 

                                                       𝝁 = ⁡

Where 𝛾  is  the  conductivity  of  thin-film  (𝛾  =  1/ρs),  q  is  a  charge  of  the  electron  and  ns  is  the 
concentration of majority carrier. The majority carrier mobility in the film at 300K calculated using 
equation (4) is 5.7106 cm2V-1s-1, which is very high. 
In summary, from transport measurement it is concluded that film behaves as n-type semiconductor 
exhibiting low resistivity and very high carrier mobility at 300K. 

3.4 Magnetic measurement 

The magnetic moment (m) of the film as a function of the applied magnetic field (H) was measured at 
300K.  In  Fig.  4(a)  the  m(H)  data  plot  for  the  bare  film  is  shown  after  subtracting  the  contribution 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from  the  quartz  substrate,  which  exhibits  ferromagnetic  hysteresis  loop  superimposed  on  a 
paramagnetic signal. Measurement of m(H) on the bare quartz substrate was carried out before  film 
deposition,  which  is  also  shown  in  Fig.  4(a).  For  clarity,  zoomed  m(H)  plot  at  low  field  region  is 
shown in inset . 
Contribution  of the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop  (FM) was separated from  the paramagnetic (PM) 
part by fitting the experimentally measured m(H) data plot using the following equation (5) [11]:

FM  is  saturation  magnetization,  Hci  is  intrinsic  coercivity  and  MR

Where  MS
FM  is  remanence  of  the 
FM  part,  while  χ  is  the  susceptibility  of  PM  part  and  M(H)  is  the  magnetization  of  the  film 
measured as a function of the applied magnetic field. The magnetic moment (m) was converted into 
magnetization (M) by dividing it with film volume. The fitted M(H) graph is shown in Fig. 4(b) and 
its inset show the fitting quality at low magnetic field. The fitted parameters are tabulated in Table 
1. It can be seen from Table 1 that the susceptibility χ of the PM part is 6.9  10-2. The saturation 
magnetization (MS
FM) of FM part is 1.14 x 104 JT-1m-3 (≈ 11emu/cc) and 7  
102 JT-1m-3 (≈ 0.7 emu/cc), respectively. The important point that can be observed in Table 1 is that 
the intrinsic coercivity (Hci) and Stoner-Wohlfarth number (MS
FM ) of FM part is (49 ± 6) Oe 
and  (0.07  ±  0.007)  respectively,  which  is  very  small.  Therefore,  the  film  can  be  considered 
consisting of non-interacting superparamagnetic (SPM) particles, which contributes to the FM part. 
Following  Chantrell  et  al.  [12,13]  for  dispersion  of  non-interacting  SPM  particles  throughout  the 
film, the magnetization can be expressed as,

as given below [12,13],

The first quadrant of the RT-MH graph fitted using equation (7) is shown in Fig. 4(c). The adj.R2 
which  defines  the  quality  of  fitting  was  0.99998  (close  to  1)  showing  a  very  good  fit.  The 
parameters  obtained  after  fitting  is  tabulated  in  Table  2.  It  can  be  seen  in  Table  2  that  the  bulk 
saturation magnetization (MSB) of SPM particles contributing to the FM part is 21.1104 JT-1m-3 (≈ 
211  emu/cc).  However,  the  magnetic  volume  packing  fraction  (ε)  obtained  by  (MS/MSB)  is  only 
0.057,  which  indicates  that  the  SPM  particles  occupy  only  5.7%  of  total  film  volume.  The  total 
magnetic volume (VMag) of SPM particles is 1.851013 nm3, while the total film volume is 32.61013 
nm3. Furthermore, the LND plot of the number of SPM particles as a function of  particle volume 
obtained  using  equation  (8)  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(d).  The  mode  of  the  LND  plot  is  45  nm3.  The 
median and standard deviation of the LND plot is also given in Table 2, which is 667 nm3 and 1.2, 
respectively. The LND plot is highly asymmetric and there is a large deviation observed between 
median and mode value indicating random volume distribution of SPM particles in the film. 
The magnetic measurement results described above confirms the presence of magnetic moment in 
the film at 300K. In the majority of the film, the magnetic moments are isolated and non-interacting 
contributing to the PM part. However, in a small volume fraction of the film (~ 5.7%), the magnetic 
moments are close enough to interact with each other in a short-range (~ volume 45 nm3) forming 
non-interacting SPM particles, which contributes to FM part. 

4. Theoretical simulation 

The next question, which needs to be addressed, is the origin of the observed magnetic moment in 
the  film.  From  XPS  and  EDX  results  it  is  observed  that  the  stoichiometry  of  the  film  consists  of 
Al2O3  with  dilute  nitrogen  incorporated  in  it.  Hence,  the  following  two  possibilities  can  be 
considered responsible for an observed magnetic moment in the film:  1) presence of pristine Al2O3 
and 2) the presence of one extra nitrogen sitting at the interstitial site in Al2O3 i.e., (Al2O3)1N.  

In  order  to  further  investigate,  the  density  of  state  (DOS)  and  band  structure  was  theoretically 
simulated using first-principles calculations based on DFT on supercell (space group R3c[167]) of 
size  2×1×1  of  Al2O3  and  (Al2O3)1N,  respectively.  A  small  supercell  has  been  chosen  for 
computation since the deposited film is amorphous (confirmed from GIXRD) indicating the absence 
of long-range ordering. The spin polarised calculation is performed using the CASTEP (Cambridge 
Sequential  Total  Energy  Package)  program  code  in  Materials  Studio  software  (version  7.0)  [14]. 
Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew-Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) form was used 
as  an  exchange-correlation  function  [15].    Self-consistent  field  calculation  (Tolerance  -  5.0×10-7 
eV/atom)  was  employed  in  a  plane  wave  basis.  The  norm-conserving  pseudopotential  is  used  to 
describe  the  electron-ion  interaction  with  cut-off  energy  of  830  eV.  A  (3×7×7)  Monkhorst-  pack 
mesh is used for the generation of the Brillouin zone during geometry optimization in the supercell. 
The structure is fully relaxed by geometrical optimization calculation by the motion of the atomic 
position and lattice parameter with the convergence threshold of the remanent Hellmann-Feynman 
force  of  0.001  eV/Å.  Finally,  on  the  relaxed  structure,  the  density  of  state  (DOS)  and  bandgap 
calculation  were  performed.  Furthermore,  the  spin-polarized  molecular  dynamics  simulation  was 
carried out on optimized (2×1×1) supercell of (Al2O3)1N.  

The optimized supercell of Al2O3 and (Al2O3)1N used for calculation is shown in Fig. 5 (a) and 
(b),  respectively.  The  ground  state  energy  obtained  for  the  optimized  supercell  of  Al2O3  and 
(Al2O3)1N is -5673.12 eV & -5935.89 eV, respectively. It can be noticed that the ground state energy 
of (Al2O3)1N is lower than Al2O3 indicating that (Al2O3)1N is  thermodynamically more stable than 
Al2O3.  Therefore,  the  nitrogen  incorporated  in  Al2O3  will  prefer  to  sit  at  the  interstitial  site. 

 
 
Simulated spin-resolved DOS and band structure along high symmetry point in the Brillouin zone 
for optimized supercell of Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d), respectively. In the case of Al2O3 
large  direct  bandgap  of  7.06  eV  is  observed,  which  is  very  close  to  that  reported  in  the  literature 
[16]. In Fig. 5(c) it can be observed that there is symmetry in both spins up and spin down states 
and hence the net magnetic moment for Al2O3 is 0 µB. Thus, Al2O3 is non-magnetic and could not 
contribute to the magnetic moment observed in the film.  

Simulated spin-resolved DOS and band structure for optimized supercell of (Al2O3)1N are shown in 
Fig. 5 (e) and (f), respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 5(e), there is an asymmetry in spin up and 
spin  down  states  with  a  net  magnetic  moment  of  1  µB.  Therefore,  it  is  concluded  that  (Al2O3)1N 
mainly contributes to the magnetic moment observed in the film. Furthermore, from Fig. 5(c)  and 
Fig. 5(e)  it can be noticed that in case of (Al2O3)1N, i.e., inserting one nitrogen at the interstitial site 
in  Al2O3  results  in  the  creation  of  some  new  spin-down  states  near  to  the  Fermi  level,  which  is 
absent  in  Al2O3.  Hence,  there  is  also  a  possibility  of  spin-polarized  transport  in  (Al2O3)1N.  The 
simulated band structure of optimized (Al2O3)1N supercell has an indirect bandgap of 1.72 eV and 
4.1  eV  for  spin  down  and  spins  up  sates,  respectively  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  5(f)  .  The  indirect 
bandgap observed in (Al2O3)1N might be also useful for application in the field of optoelectronics 
and photonics and needs to be explored further, which is beyond the scope of the present work. 

Spin-polarized molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been also carried out on an optimized 
(Al2O3)1N  supercell  to  examine  whether  the  net  magnetic  moment  also  sustains  at  RT.  The 
molecular  dynamics  simulation  is  performed  with  Nose-Hoover  thermostat  at  300K  and  the 
simulation time was kept as 0.5 ps. The fluctuation in the temperature during simulation steps and 
the corresponding changes in the magnetic moment are shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), respectively. 
The system sustains an average magnetic moment of ~ 1µB at 300K during the simulation time of 
0.5 ps. The structure  remains  unaffected  after  MD simulation  due to  the larger binding energy  of 
Al-Al  and  Al-O  bonds  compared  to  thermal  energy  at  300K.  Thus,  MD  simulation  confirms  that 
(Al2O3)1N sustains a magnetic moment at room temperature. 

In summary, from theoretical simulation, it is confirmed that for thermodynamic stability the dilute 
nitrogen incorporated in Al2O3 prefers to sit at the interstitial sites. The nitrogen interstitial sites in 
Al2O3 induce a net magnetic moment, which sustains at 300K.  

5. Conclusions 

Residual oxygen plays a significant role during the deposition of AlN film using reactive sputtering 
of  the  aluminium  target  in  a  dilute  nitrogen  environment.  In  the  presence  of  dilute  nitrogen  Al 
prefers  to  react  with  residual  oxygen  to  form  Al2O3  while  the  nitrogen  is  incorporated  in  it.  For 
thermodynamic stability, nitrogen prefers to sit at interstitial sites in Al2O3. The nitrogen interstitial 
sites at Al2O3 induce magnetic moment in the film, which sustains at 300K. The nitrogen interstitial 
sites  are  also  responsible  for  n-type  majority  carriers.  Furthermore,  inserting  one  nitrogen  at  the 
interstitial site in Al2O3 results in the creation of some new spin-down states near to the Fermi level, 
which is absent in Al2O3. Hence, there is also a possibility of spin-polarized transport in (Al2O3)1N. 
The film exhibits rarely observed n-type Dilute Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS) property at room 
temperature (RT) desirable for potential application in the field of spintronics.
