Abstract. An experiment on the study of the 246Fm spontaneous ﬁssion was conducted using the SHELS
separator. The isotope was synthesized in the complete fusion reaction of 40Ar beam ions and 208Pb target
nuclei. The neutron yields of 246Fm spontaneous ﬁssion (ν = 3.79 ± 0.30, σ2
ν = 2.1) were obtained using
the SFiNx detector system. The multiplicity distribution of emitted prompt neutrons was restored using
the Tikhonov method of statistical regularisation (νr = 3.79 ± 0.20, σ2
νr = 2.8). The spontaneous ﬁssion
branching ratio (bSF = 0.061 ± 0.005) and the half-life (T1/2 = 1.50+0.08
−0.07 s) of the isotope were determined.
The experimental data were compared with scission point model predictions. Excellent convergence was
observed in the average number of neutrons per spontaneous ﬁssion process. However, the forms of the
experimental and model prompt neutron multiplicity distributions diﬀer signiﬁcantly.

1 Introduction

Spontaneous ﬁssion is a common decay mode for heavy
atomic nuclei and deﬁnes the limits of existence of chem-
ical elements in this region. The mass and energy distri-
butions of ﬁssion fragments and prompt neutron yields
are important characteristics describing this process. How-
ever, the study of the properties of the heaviest nuclei is
complicated by their short lifetimes and small formation
cross-sections, which requires the use of advanced experi-
mental methods.

Data on prompt neutron yields from spontaneous ﬁs-
sion were accumulated earlier for many isotopes with Z <
100, mainly in oﬄine experiments. For fermium (Z = 100),
such data were obtained both for neutron-rich isotopes
254,256,257Fm [1, 2, 3] and neutron-deﬁcient ones (online
experiments) 244,246Fm [4, 5]. The 246Fm prompt γ-ray
spectroscopy was performed at the University of Jyv¨asjyl¨a
[6] and is the lowest cross-section reaction where this was
possible for such heavy nuclei. The 246Fm prompt neutron

yields are the most poorly known because only 108 [5] ﬁs-
sion events were obtained. Therefore, the purpose of the
present work was to repeat the synthesis of 246Fm in or-
der to obtain more statistics and reﬁne its prompt neutron
yield data.

2 Experiment

An experiment aimed at studying the spontaneous ﬁssion
properties of the 246Fm isotope was carried out at FLNR
JINR using the SHELS separator [7] and the SFiNx de-
tection system [8] (Fig. 1). The system includes 116 3He-
neutron counters that allow registering multiple prompt
neutrons emitted in the spontaneous ﬁssion process of the
nucleus, as well as an assembly («well» like) of double-
sided Si detectors with a 128×128-strip focal-plane detec-
tor and 8 tunnel 16×16-strip detectors for ﬁssion-fragment
and α-particle registration (Fig. 2). The high granularity
of the SFiNx neutron detector makes it possible to register
multiple neutron events with a negligible probability that

for in the time interval 30 ms – 15.4 s following the regis-
tration of the implanted reaction products.

A total of 235 246Fm spontaneous ﬁssions were found
during data analysis, and only 2 events (in the interval 0 –
30 ms) were assigned to the spontaneous ﬁssion of 244Fm.
The 246Fm half-life was obtained as T1/2 = 1.50+0.08
−0.07 s
from the time distribution shown in Fig. 3. The value is
in good agreement with the previously-measured values of
1.54±0.04 s [10], 1.3±0.2 s [5] and 1.6±0.2 s [6].

To determine the spontaneous ﬁssion branching ra-
tio, α particles were searched for in the time interval 30
ms – 15.4 s from the recoil implantation signal (Fig. 4).
After background subtraction, 1809 α-decays were found
in the energy range 8190 – 8260 keV. The spontaneous
ﬁssion branching ratio was obtained as bSF = 0.061 ±
0.005, which agrees with the previously published values
of 0.068±0.006 [10] and 0.05±0.03 [5].

Prompt neutrons emitted in the spontaneous ﬁssion of
fermium were searched for in the time interval 0 – 128
µs from the moment of the ﬁssion-fragment registration.
The neutron time distribution in the coincidence window
is shown in Fig. 5. A total of 488 prompt neutrons from
235 246Fm spontaneous ﬁssion events were registered.

The prompt neutron multiplicity for 246Fm extracted
from the data is shown in Fig. 6. Taking into account the
detector eﬃciency, the characteristics of the multiplicity
distribution of the emitted neutrons were obtained: the
mean as ν = 3.79 ± 0.30 and the variance as σ2
ν = 2.1.
The obtained ν value agrees well with 3.55±0.50 already
measured in Ref. [5].

The true form of the neutron multiplicity distribution
was restored using Tikhonov’s method of statistical reg-
ularization [12]. The reconstruction results are shown in
Fig. 6 and in the table 1.

a single 3He-counter will detect several neutrons simulta-
neously within the coincidence time window [8]. The neu-
tron registration eﬃciency, measured with a 248Cm source,
is (54.8±0.1)%, and the average neutron lifetime in the
array is 18.4±0.2 µs. The detection eﬃciency of the focal-
plane Si detector for α-particles emitted by implanted nu-
clei is ∼50% and 100% for at least one of the two ﬁssion
fragments.

The complete fusion reaction of 40Ar16+ ions from the
U-400 cyclotron with a 208Pb target nuclei was used to
synthesize 246Fm. The PbS target thickness was 450 µg/cm2
(the 208Pb isotope enrichment was over 99%), and a 1.5
µm thick titanium backing was used. The ion beam energy
was 183±3 MeV and it was chosen close to the maximum
of the excitation function of the 2n-evaporation channel [5,
9, 6]. The total number of beam ions that passed through
the target and then stopped in a faraday cup was about
1.7×1018.

Since 206Pb impurities in the target (< 1%) can lead
to the production of the spontaneously ﬁssile 244Fm with
T1/2 ∼ 3 ms, ﬁssion fragments from 246Fm were searched

tection and the spontaneous ﬁssion of 246Fm.

For the reconstructed distribution, the average number

of neutrons is 3.79±0.20 and the variance is 2.8.

An additional search was made for neutron events in
the time interval 200 – 328 µs from the 246Fm sponta-
neous ﬁssion registration for background estimation. The
interval duration was equal to the duration of the 246Fm
prompt neutrons search. The choice of the lower boundary
of the search interval was based on the average neutron
lifetime in the detector and set to eliminate the detection
of fermium prompt neutrons. Only 5 background neutrons
were detected (see Fig. 5) for 235 246Fm spontaneous ﬁs-
sion events. The inﬂuence of the background was insignif-
icant in comparison with the level of statistical errors ob-
tained in the experiment (the background to signal ratio
is about 1% whereas the relative statistical error is about
8%).

3 Model

The theoretical calculations of neutron multiplicity distri-
butions were carried out with the improved scission point
model [13]. The model assumes that the observed charac-
teristics of the ﬁssion process are formed at the scission
point, where the ﬁssile nucleus can be represented as a
superposition of systems consisting of two adjoining frag-
ments (A1, Z1, β1) and (A2, Z2, β2). Assuming statistical
equilibrium, the probability of realization of various bi-
nary conﬁgurations G(Ai, Zi, βi, i = 1, 2) is determined by
the potential energy as a function of masses Ai, charges
Zi, deformations βi of the fragments [14] and excitation
energy U (cid:63). For a particular scission conﬁguration with

4

ﬁxed charge and mass numbers of the fragments, the po-
tential energy as a function of the deformation parameters
β1 and β2 can have one or several minima depending on
the interplay of the macroscopic liquid-drop energy and
microscopic shell eﬀects. Calculations show that for the
nuclei considered in this paper, the potential energy min-
imum occurs at deformations βi (cid:38) 2. For such large de-
formations, the pocket in the interaction potential of the
fragments disappears, and the system becomes unstable.
Thus, the ﬁssile nucleus reaches strongly deformed conﬁg-
urations with fewer probabilities than it follows from the
assumption of statistical equilibrium. To account for this
eﬀect, the probabilities G(Ai, Zi, βi) are multiplied by a
factor

In this work, for all nuclei, the parameter values β0 = 1.7
and s = 0.08 were used.

For each system with given masses, charges, and de-
formations of the fragments, the probability of n neutrons
being emitted is calculated as

where Ui and U d
i , (i = 1, 2) are the excitation energy
of the i-th fragment available at the scission point and
its deformation energy with respect to its ground state,
respectively. The quantity Pi(x, Ui + U d
i ) determines the
probability that exactly x neutrons will be emitted from
the i-th fragment [15]. The probability that the excitation
energy at the scission point will be distributed between
the fragments as U1 and U2, U1 + U2 = U (cid:63), is given by
the function

F (U1) ∼ ρ(a1, U1)ρ(a2, U2 = U (cid:63) − U1),

(3)

where the level densities ρ of the fragments are taken in
the form of a Fermi gas distribution with the level den-
sity parameters ai = Ai/12 [16]. After separation, it is
assumed that the deformation energy of the fragment is
converted into its excitation energy.

Within the framework of this model, the distributions
of prompt neutron multiplicities for 252Cf and 248Cm were
calculated (Fig. 7). One can observe a reasonable agree-
ment between the model predictions and experimental
data for both the average neutron numbers and the shape
of the distributions (table 2).

In Fig. 9, the calculation results are presented for 246Fm.
The calculated average number of neutrons in the sponta-
neous ﬁssion process is 3.77, which agrees very well with
the value measured in this experiment 3.79±0.30. How-
ever, the calculated distribution for 246Fm is narrower
than the experimental one (the numerical parameters of
the distributions are given in table 2). The discrepancies
between the theoretical and experimental distributions ex-
ceed the values of statistical errors.

(top) and 248Cm (bottom). Symbols: triangles – calculations
within the scission point model; squares – data from [17]; stars

A comparison of the theoretical distributions for 252Cf,
248Cm, and 246Fm show that for the latter there is a
strong suppression of low multiplicity events. To under-
stand this, a comparative analysis of the corresponding
potential energy surfaces has been conducted (Fig. 8). We
observed that for the most probable scission conﬁgurations
of 252Cf and 248Cm, the potential energy as a function of
the fragment’s deformation has two minima; a more com-
pact one (β1 ≈ 1.7, β2 ≈ 1.3) and a strongly deformed
one (β1 ≈ 1.7, β2 (cid:38) 2). The compact minimum leads to
larger total kinetic energy of the fragments and a smaller
number of emitted neutrons. In the statistical equilibrium
assumption, the probability of realization of diﬀerent de-
formations is split into two sizeable parts corresponding to
these two minima. The use of the factor from equation (1)
which accounts for deviations from statistical equilibrium
increases the role of the compact minimum.

However, in the case of 246Fm, the compact minimum
in the potential energy as a function of deformation is ab-
sent. The probability distribution taken in the statistical
equilibrium approach is fully concentrated in the region of
large deformation. The compact systems related to a small
number of emitted neutrons are realized with negligible

a result, the true shape of the emitted neutron multiplicity
distribution was obtained with the best precision.

Today there is no complete model of nuclear ﬁssion
that could describe all the characteristics of the ﬁssion
process for each speciﬁc nucleus. For the development of
theoretical approaches, it is important to obtain new ex-
perimental data, especially for short-lived nuclei in the
Z ≥ 100 region. In this paper, we have used an improved
scission point model [13], which made it possible to pre-
dict prompt neutron multiplicity distributions for 252Cf,
248Cm, and 246Fm nuclei. The model perfectly describes
the average number of neutrons in the ﬁssion processes
of all the listed nuclei as well as the shapes of the neu-
tron multiplicity distributions for 252Cf and 248Cm. For
246Fm the width of the calculated distribution is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than that of the experimental distribution.
The latter indicates that a more sophisticated way to ac-

probabilities. This cannot be signiﬁcantly corrected by the
factor from equation (1). Therefore, we can conclude that
a more accurate account for the non-equilibrium eﬀects is
needed for 246Fm. This work is currently in progress.

4 Сonclusions

As a result of the experiment, the emission probabilities
of 246Fm prompt neutrons of diﬀerent multiplicities were
measured with the best accuracy (Fig. 9). The most accu-
rate value of the average number of neutrons per sponta-
neous ﬁssion decay of 246Fm is obtained ν = 3.79 ± 0.30.
Since the neutron detection eﬃciency of the SFiNx [8]
is (54.8±0.1)% and the collected statistics is small (235
spontaneous ﬁssion events with 488 prompt neutrons in
total), in order to obtain the true form of the prompt
neutron multiplicity distribution, the use of the statistical
regularization method is necessary. This procedure was
successfully made for 246Fm prompt neutrons data and as
