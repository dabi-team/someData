Observation of a Large-scale Anisotropy in the
Arrival Directions of Cosmic Rays above 8×1018 eV

The Pierre Auger Collaboration*†

22 September 2017

Abstract

Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach the highest energies ob-
served in nature. Clues to their origin come from studying the distribution of their arrival di-
rections. Using 3×104 cosmic rays above 8×1018 electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger
Observatory from a total exposure of 76,800 square kilometers steradian year, we report an
anisotropy in the arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at more than the 5.2σ level of
signiﬁcance, can be described by a dipole with an amplitude of 6.5+1.3
−0.9% towards right ascen-
sion αd = 100 ± 10 degrees and declination δd = −24+12
−13 degrees. That direction indicates an
extragalactic origin for these ultra-high energy particles.

Particles with energies ranging from below 109 eV up to beyond 1020 eV, known as cosmic
rays, constantly hit the Earth’s atmosphere. The ﬂux of these particles steeply decreases as their
energy increases; for energies above 10 EeV (1 EeV ≡ 1018 eV), the ﬂux is about one particle per
km2 per year. The existence of cosmic rays with such ultra-high energies has been known for
more than 50 years [1, 2], but the sites and mechanisms of their production remain a mystery. In-
formation about their origin can be obtained from the study of the energy spectrum and the mass
composition of cosmic rays. However, the most direct evidence of the location of the progeni-
tors is expected to come from studies of the distribution of their arrival directions. Indications
of possible hot spots in arrival directions for cosmic rays with energy above 50 EeV have been
reported by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Collaborations [3, 4], but the statistical signif-
icance of these results is low. We report the observation, signiﬁcant at a level of more than 5.2σ,
of a large-scale anisotropy in arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 EeV.

Above 1014 eV, cosmic rays entering the atmosphere create cascades of particles (called ex-
tensive air-showers) that are sufﬁciently large to reach the ground. At 10 EeV, an extensive air-
shower (hereafter shower) contains ∼1010 particles spread over an area of ∼20 km2 in a thin
disc moving close to the speed of light. The showers contain an electromagnetic component
(electrons, positrons and photons) and a muonic component that can be sampled using arrays
of particle detectors. Charged particles in the shower also excite nitrogen molecules in the air,
producing ﬂuorescence light that can be observed with telescopes during clear nights.

The Pierre Auger Observatory, located near the city of Malarg ¨ue, Argentina, at latitude 35.2◦S,
is designed to detect showers produced by primary cosmic rays above 0.1 EeV. It is a hybrid
system, a combination of an array of particle detectors and a set of telescopes used to detect the
ﬂuorescence light. Our analysis is based on data gathered from 1600 water-Cherenkov detectors
deployed over an area of 3000 km2 on a hexagonal grid with 1500-m spacing. Each detector
contains 12 tonnes of ultrapure water in a cylindrical container, 1.2 m deep and 10 m2 in area,
viewed by three 9-inch photomultipliers. A full description of the observatory, together with
details of the methods used to reconstruct the arrival directions and energies of events, has been
published [5].

It is difﬁcult to locate the sources of cosmic rays, as they are charged particles and thus interact
with the magnetic ﬁelds in our galaxy and the intergalactic medium that lies between the sources
and Earth. They undergo angular deﬂections with amplitude proportional to their atomic num-
ber Z, to the integral along the trajectory of the magnetic ﬁeld (orthogonal to the direction of
propagation), and to the inverse of their energy E. At E ≈ 10 EeV, the best estimates for the mass
of the particles [6] lead to a mean value for Z between 1.7 and 5. The exact number derived is
dependent on extrapolations of hadronic physics, which are poorly understood because they lie
well beyond the observations made at the Large Hadron Collider. Magnetic ﬁelds are not well
constrained by data, but if we adopt recent models of the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld [7,8], typical val-
ues of the deﬂections of particles crossing the Galaxy are a few tens of degrees for E/Z = 10 EeV,
depending on the direction considered [9]. Extragalactic magnetic ﬁelds may also be relevant
for cosmic rays propagating through intergalactic space [10]. However, even if particles from
individual sources are strongly deﬂected, it remains possible that anisotropies in the distribution
of their arrival directions will be detectable on large angular scales, provided the sources have
a nonuniform spatial distribution or, in the case of a single dominant source, if the cosmic-ray
propagation is diffusive [11–14].

Searches for large-scale anisotropies are conventionally made by looking for nonuniformities
in the distribution of events in right ascension [15,16] because, for arrays of detectors that operate
with close to 100% efﬁciency, the total exposure as a function of this angle is almost constant. The
nonuniformity of the detected cosmic-ray ﬂux in declination (ﬁg. S1) imprints a characteristic
nonuniformity in the distribution of azimuth angles in the local coordinate system of the array.
From this distribution it becomes possible to obtain information on the three components of a
dipolar model.

Event observations, selection, and calibration

We analyzed data recorded at the Pierre Auger Observatory between 1 January 2004 and 31
August 2016, from a total exposure of about 76,800 km2 sr year. The 1.2-m depth of the water-
Cherenkov detectors enabled us to record events at a useful rate out to large values of the zenith
angle, θ. We selected events with θ < 80◦ enabling the declination range −90◦ < δ < 45◦ to be
explored, thus covering 85% of the sky. We adopted 4 EeV as the threshold for selection; above
that energy, showers falling anywhere on the array are detected with 100% efﬁciency [17]. The
arrival directions of cosmic rays were determined from the relative arrival times of the shower
front at each of the triggered detectors; the angular resolution was better than 1◦ at the energies
considered here [5].

Two methods of reconstruction have been used for showers with zenith angles above and be-
low 60◦ [17, 18]. These have to account for the effects of the geomagnetic ﬁeld [17, 19] and, in the
case of showers with θ < 60◦, also for atmospheric effects [20] because systematic modulations
to the rates could otherwise be induced (see supplementary materials). The energy estimators
for both data sets were calibrated using events detected simultaneously by the water-Cherenkov
detectors and the ﬂuorescence telescopes, with a quasi-calorimetric determination of the energy
coming from the ﬂuorescence measurements. The statistical uncertainty in the energy determi-
nation is 16% above 4 EeV and 12% above 10 EeV, whereas the systematic uncertainty on the
absolute energy scale, common to both data sets, is 14% [21]. Evidence that the analyses of the
events with θ < 60◦ and of those with 60◦ < θ < 80◦ are consistent with each other comes from
the energy spectra determined for the two angular bands. The spectra agree within the statistical
uncertainties over the energy range of interest [22].

We consider events in two energy ranges, 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV and E ≥ 8 EeV, as adopted in
previous analyses (e.g., [23–25]). The bin limits follow those chosen previously in [26, 27]. The
median energies for these bins are 5.0 EeV and 11.5 EeV, respectively. In earlier work [23–25], the
event selection required that the station with the highest signal be surrounded by six operational
detectors—a demanding condition. The number of triggered stations is greater than four for
99.2% of all events above 4 EeV and for 99.9% of events above 8 EeV, making it possible to use

2

events with only ﬁve active detectors around the one with the largest signal. With this more
relaxed condition, the effective exposure is increased by 18.5%, and the total number of events
increases correspondingly from 95,917 to 113,888. The reconstruction accuracy for the additional
events is sufﬁcient for our analysis (see supplementary materials and ﬁg. S4).

Rayleigh analysis in right ascension

A standard approach for studying the large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of cosmic
rays is to perform a harmonic analysis in right ascension, α. The ﬁrst-harmonic Fourier compo-
nents are given by

aα =

N

N
∑
i=1

wi cos αi,

bα =

N

N
∑
i=1

wi sin αi.

(1)

The sums run over all N detected events, each with right ascension αi, with the normalization
factor N = ∑N
i=1 wi. The weights, wi, are introduced to account for small nonuniformities in
the exposure of the array in right ascension and for the effects of a tilt of the array towards the
southeast (see supplementary materials). The average tilt between vertical and the normal to
the plane on which the detectors are deployed is 0.2◦, so that the effective area of the array is
slightly larger for showers arriving from the downhill direction. This introduces a harmonic
dependence in azimuth of amplitude 0.3% × tan θ to the exposure. The effective aperture of the
array is determined every minute. Because the exposure has been accumulated over more than
12 years, the total aperture is modulated by less than ∼0.6% as the zenith of the observatory
moves in right ascension. Events are weighted by the inverse of the relative exposure to correct
these effects (ﬁg. S2).

The amplitude rα and phase ϕα of the ﬁrst harmonic of the modulation are obtained from

Table 1 shows the harmonic amplitudes and phases for both energy ranges. The statistical un-
2/N ; the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase
certainties in the Fourier amplitudes are
correspond to the 68% conﬁdence level of the marginalized probability distribution functions.
The rightmost column shows the probabilities that amplitudes larger than those observed could
arise by chance from ﬂuctuations in an isotropic distribution. These probabilities are calculated
as P(rα) = exp(−N r2
α/4) [28]. For the lower energy bin (4 EeV < E < 8 EeV), the result is con-
sistent with isotropy, with a bound on the harmonic amplitude of <1.2% at the 95% conﬁdence
level. For the events with E ≥ 8 EeV, the amplitude of the ﬁrst harmonic is 4.7+0.8
−0.7%, which
has a probability of arising by chance of 2.6×10−8, equivalent to a two-sided Gaussian signiﬁ-
cance of 5.6σ. The evolution of the signiﬁcance of this signal with time is shown in ﬁg. S3; the
dipole became more signiﬁcant as the exposure increased. Allowing for a penalization factor of
2 to account for the fact that two energy bins were explored, the signiﬁcance is reduced to 5.4σ.
Further penalization for the four additional lower energy bins examined in [23] has a similarly
mild impact on the signiﬁcance, which falls to 5.2σ. The maximum of the modulation is at right
ascension of 100◦ ± 10◦. The maximum of the modulation for the 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV bin, at
80◦ ± 60◦, is compatible with the one determined in the higher-energy bin, although it has high
uncertainty and the amplitude is not statistically signiﬁcant. Table S1 shows that results obtained
under the stricter trigger condition and for the additional events gained after relaxing the trigger
are entirely consistent with each other.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the normalized rate of events above 8 EeV as a function
of right ascension. The sinusoidal function corresponds to the ﬁrst harmonic; the distribution is
compatible with a dipolar modulation: χ2/n = 10.5/10 for the ﬁrst-harmonic curve and χ2/n =
45/12 for a constant function (where n is the number of degrees of freedom, equal to the number
of points in the plot minus the number of parameters of the ﬁt).

tion to better display the large-scale features, is shown in Fig. 2.

Reconstruction of the three-dimensional dipole

In the presence of a three-dimensional dipole, the Rayleigh analysis in right ascension is sensitive
only to its component orthogonal to the rotation axis of Earth, d⊥. A dipole component in the
direction of the rotation axis of Earth, dz, induces no modulation of the ﬂux in right ascension,
but does so in the azimuthal distribution of the directions of arrival at the array. A non-vanishing
value of dz leads to a sinusoidal modulation in azimuth with a maximum toward the northern or
the southern direction.

To recover the three-dimensional dipole, we combine the ﬁrst-harmonic analysis in right as-
cension with a similar one in the azimuthal angle ϕ, measured counterclockwise from the east.
The relevant component, bϕ, is given by an expression analogous to that in Eq. 1, but in terms of
the azimuth of the arrival direction of the shower rather than in terms of the right ascension. The
results are bϕ = −0.013 ± 0.005 in the 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV bin and bϕ = −0.014 ± 0.008 in the
E ≥ 8 EeV bin. The probabilities that larger or equal absolute values for bϕ arise from an isotropic
distribution are 0.8% and 8%, respectively.

The parameters describing the direction of the three-dimensional dipole are summarized in
Table 2. For 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV, the dipole amplitude is d = 2.5+1.0
−0.7%, pointing close to the celes-
tial south pole, at (αd, δd) = (80◦, −75◦), although the amplitude is not statistically signiﬁcant.
For energies above 8 EeV, the total dipole amplitude is d = 6.5+1.3
−0.9%, pointing toward (αd, δd) =
(100◦, −24◦). In Galactic coordinates, the direction of this dipole is ((cid:96), b) = (233◦, −13◦). This
dipolar pattern is clearly seen in the ﬂux map in Fig. 2. To establish whether the departures from
a perfect dipole are just statistical ﬂuctuations or indicate the presence of additional structures at
smaller angular scales would require at least twice as many events.

The anisotropy we have found should be seen in the context of related results at lower energies.
Above a few PeV, the steepening of the cosmic ray energy spectrum has been interpreted as being
due to efﬁcient escape of particles from the Galaxy and/or because of the inability of the sources
to accelerate cosmic rays beyond a maximum value of E/Z. The origin of the particles remains
unknown. Although supernova remnants are often discussed as sources, evidence has been re-
ported for a source in the Galactic center capable of accelerating particles to PeV energies [31].
Diffusive escape from the Galaxy is expected to lead to a dipolar component with a maximum
near the Galactic center direction [32]. This is compatible with results obtained in the 1015 to
1018 eV range [15,16,23,24,33], which provide values for the phase in right ascension close to that
of the Galactic center, αGC = 266◦.

Models proposing a Galactic origin up to the highest observed energies [34, 35] are in increas-
ing tension with observations. If the Galactic sources postulated to accelerate cosmic rays above
EeV energies, such as short gamma-ray bursts or hypernovae, were distributed in the disk of the
Galaxy, a dipolar component of anisotropy is predicted with an amplitude that exceeds existing
bounds at EeV energies [24, 33]. In this sense, the constraint obtained here on the dipole ampli-
tude (Table 2) for 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV further disfavors a predominantly Galactic origin. This
tension could be alleviated if cosmic rays at a few EeV were dominated by heavy nuclei such as
iron, but this would be in disagreement with the lighter composition inferred observationally at
these energies [6]. The maximum of the ﬂux might be expected to lie close to the Galactic center
region, whereas the direction of the three-dimensional dipole determined above 8 EeV lies ∼125◦
from the Galactic center. This suggests that the anisotropy observed above 8 EeV is better ex-
plained in terms of an extragalactic origin. Above 40 EeV, where the propagation should become
less diffusive, there are no indications of anisotropies associated with either the Galactic center
or the Galactic plane [36].

There have been many efforts to interpret the properties of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays
in terms of extragalactic sources. Because of Liouville’s theorem, the distribution of cosmic
rays must be anisotropic outside of the Galaxy for an anisotropy to be observed at Earth. An
anisotropy cannot arise through deﬂections of an originally isotropic ﬂux by a magnetic ﬁeld.
One prediction of anisotropy comes from the Compton-Getting effect [37], which results from
the proper motion of the Earth in the rest frame of cosmic-ray sources, but the amplitude is ex-
pected to be only 0.6% [38], well below what has been observed. Other studies have predicted
larger anisotropies. These assume that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays originate from an inhomo-
geneous distribution of sources [13, 14, 39], or that they arise from a dominant source and then
diffuse through intergalactic magnetic ﬁelds [11–14]. The resulting dipole amplitudes are pre-
dicted to grow with energy, reaching 5 to 20% at 10 EeV. These amplitudes depend on the cosmic-
ray composition as well as the details of the source distribution. On average, the predictions are
smaller for larger source densities or for more isotropically distributed sources. If the sources
were distributed like galaxies, the distribution of which has a signiﬁcant dipolar component [40],
a dipolar cosmic-ray anisotropy would be expected in a direction similar to that of the dipole
associated with the galaxies. This effect would be due to the excess of cosmic-ray sources in this
direction and is different from the Compton-Getting effect due to the Earth’s motion with respect
to the rest frame of cosmic rays. For the infrared-detected galaxies in the 2MRS catalogue [40], the
ﬂux-weighted dipole points in Galactic coordinates in the direction ((cid:96), b = (251◦, 38◦). In this co-
ordinate system, the dipole we detect for cosmic rays above 8 EeV is in the direction (233◦, −13◦),
about 55◦ away from that of the 2MRS dipole.

For an extragalactic origin, the Galactic magnetic ﬁelds modify the direction of the dipole
observed at Earth relative to its direction outside the Galaxy. For illustration, Fig. 3 shows a map
of the ﬂux above 8 EeV in which the direction of the cosmic-ray dipole is shown along with the
direction towards the 2MRS dipole. The arrows in the plot indicate how a dipolar distribution
of cosmic rays, in the same direction as the 2MRS dipole outside the Galaxy, would be affected
by the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld [8]. The tips of the arrows indicate the direction of the dipole of
the ﬂux arriving at Earth, assuming common values of E/Z = 5 EeV or 2 EeV. Given the inferred

average values for Z ∼ 1.7 to 5 at 10 EeV, these represent typical values of E/Z for the cosmic
rays contributing to the observed dipole. The agreement between the directions of the dipoles
is improved by adopting these assumptions about the charge composition and the deﬂections
in the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld. For these directions, the deﬂections within the Galaxy will also
lead to a lowering of the amplitude of the dipole to about 90% and 70% of the original value, for
E/Z = 5 EeV and 2 EeV, respectively. The lower amplitude in the 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV bin might
also be the result of stronger magnetic deﬂections at lower energies.

Our ﬁndings constitute the observation of an anisotropy in the arrival direction of cosmic rays
with energies above 8 EeV. The anisotropy can be well represented by a dipole with an amplitude
of 6.5+1.3
−0.9% in the direction of right ascension αd = 100 ± 10◦ and declination δd = −24+12
. By
−13
comparing our results with phenomenological predictions, we ﬁnd that the magnitude and di-
rection of the anisotropy support the hypothesis of an extragalactic origin for the highest-energy
cosmic rays, rather than sources within the Galaxy.

Materials and Methods

Event weights

The Fourier harmonic analysis we perform accounts for modulations in the exposure (of instru-
mental origin) as well as the effects due to the tilt of the surface detector array. To achieve this
each event is weighted by a factor

(cid:104)

wi =

(1 + sin θtilt tan θi cos (ϕi − ϕtilt)) ∆Ncell(α0
i )

(cid:105)−1

,

(S1)

where θi and φi are the zenith and azimuth angles of the events and α0
i is the right ascension
directly above the array at the time the i-th event was detected. The term enclosed by the round
brackets accounts for the effects of the slight tilt of the array. The average inclination from the
vertical is θtilt ≈ 0.2◦, in the direction φtilt ≈ −30◦, i.e. 30◦ South of the Easterly direction. The tilt
term affects only the Fourier analysis in azimuth, and thus the dipole component dz. The second
term in Eq. (S1), ∆Ncell(α0), allows for the fact that the effective aperture of the observatory is not
uniform in sidereal time. This factor corresponds to the relative number of detector cells, i.e. the
active detectors surrounded by at least ﬁve other active detectors, present when the right ascen-
sion of the zenith of the observatory equals α0 within binning accuracy. It is obtained by adding
the number of cells over the whole period of observations, with dead times due to power failures
or to communication or acquisition problems discarded. The total number of cells within each
α0 bin is normalized to the average value [22]. ∆Ncell(α0) is plotted in Fig. S2 with a bin width
of 1◦. This term affects only the Fourier analysis in right ascension, and thus the dipole compo-
nent d⊥. After more than 12 years of continuous operation of the observatory the normalized
number of cells shows variations that are smaller than ±0.6%. If the effects of the modulation
in the number of cells were not taken into account through the weights, a spurious contribution
to d⊥ of amplitude 0.05% in the direction α ≈ 145◦ would be induced. This contribution is an
order of magnitude smaller than the statistical uncertainty in the determination of this dipole
component, having then a marginal effect. If the effects of the tilt were not taken into account,
a spurious contribution to dz of −0.4% would be induced. Had we not introduced weighting to
the Fourier analysis we would have obtained: for 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV, a total dipole amplitude

Energy reconstruction

Two methods of reconstruction have been used for showers with zenith angles above and below
60◦ [16, 17]. The energy estimator used for showers with θ < 60◦ is the signal reconstructed at
1000 m from the shower core. This signal is corrected for atmospheric effects [18] that would
otherwise introduce systematic modulations to the rates as a function of time of day or season.
This could result in spurious inﬂuences on the distribution in sidereal time (a time scale that
is based on the Earth’s rate of rotation measured relative to the ﬁxed stars rather than the Sun,
corresponding to 366.25 cycles/year) and hence could be a source of systematic effects for the
anisotropies inferred. The atmospheric effects arise from the dependences of the longitudinal
and lateral attenuation of the electromagnetic component of air showers on atmospheric condi-
tions, in particular temperature and pressure. If not corrected, these could cause a modulation
of the rates of up to ±1.7% in solar time. The energy estimator is also corrected for geomagnetic
effects [19] as otherwise a systematic modulation of amplitude ∼0.7% would be induced in the
azimuthal distributions.

The particles arriving at the ground in showers with θ > 60◦ are predominantly muons. As
the atmospheric thickness traversed by a shower is proportional to sec θ, at those zenith angles

the electromagnetic component is almost completely absorbed so that atmospheric effects are
negligible. For these large angles the energy estimator is based on the muon content relative
to that in a simulated proton-shower of 10 EeV, with the geomagnetic deﬂections of muons ac-
counted for in the reconstruction of these events [17].

After applying the corrections to those events with θ < 60◦, the amplitude of modulation in
solar time (365.25 cycles/year) for the whole data set (with θ < 80◦ and E > 4 EeV) is reduced
to 0.5 ± 0.4%. This is obtained from the ﬁrst harmonic Fourier analysis of the arrival times as
a function of the hour of the day. The residual effect in right ascension, after averaging over
more than 12 years, is less than one part in a thousand. As a further check, the amplitude of
modulation at the anti-sidereal frequency (364.25 cycles/year) is 0.5 ± 0.4%, consistent with the
absence of residual systematic effects. The results of the solar and anti-sidereal amplitudes in
the two separate energy bins are also consistent with the absence of systematic effects, being, for
4 EeV < E < 8 EeV of 0.6 ± 0.5% in solar and of 0.4 ± 0.5% in anti-sidereal, while for E > 8 EeV
they are 0.7 ± 0.8% in solar and of 1.1 ± 0.8% in anti-sidereal.

Accuracy of the reconstruction of events obtained with relaxed trigger

Taking events passing the stricter cuts (with six active detectors surrounding the one with the
highest signal) and re-analyzing them after removing one of the six detectors, we ﬁnd that for
E ≥ 8 EeV (4 EeV < E < 8 EeV) the difference between the reconstructed directions has an
average of 0.3◦ (0.4◦), with 90% of the events having an angular difference smaller than 0.7◦
(1.2◦). The energy estimates differ on average by only 0.2% (0.3%), with a dispersion of ∼5%
(8%). These differences are well below the experimental uncertainties of these two parameters.
The distribution of the differences in arrival directions and reconstructed energies between the
original event satisfying the strict trigger and those with a missing detector around the one with
the highest signal are shown in ﬁg. S4. Events passing the stricter cut from two years of data
(2013 and 2014) were analyzed, leading to a total of artiﬁcial events passing the relaxed trigger of
65,000 for 4 EeV < E < 8 EeV and 27,000 for E ≥ 8,EeV.
