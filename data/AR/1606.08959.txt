First order density wave like transitions in surface doped Na2IrO3

(Dated: May 13, 2018)

We demonstrate that the surface of the honeycomb lattice iridate Na2IrO3 is extremely tunable by
plasma etching. We have succeeded in turning the surface of Na2IrO3 metallic by Ar plasma etching
which leads to the removal of Na from the surface. The surface structure does not change in this
process as revealed by grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). The sheet resistance
Rs can be reduced by several orders of magnitude by varying the etching duration. Temperature
dependent Rs(T ) for the metallic samples show signatures of spin or charge density wave transitions
with abrupt changes in Rs. Thermal hysteresis between cooling and warming measurements across
the transition indicates a ﬁrst order transition. For the most metallic sample Rs(T ) data at low
temperatures follow a T 2 behaviour suggesting normal Fermi liquid behaviour.

Doped Mott insulators can show exotic physics like
high temperature superconductivity1,2, heavy Fermion
behaviour3,4, or other correlated electron behaviour5.
Some aspects of the low energy physics of the high tem-
perature Cuprate superconductors can be understood
within a half ﬁlled single band Hubbard model1,6. Re-
cently many iridate materials have been found to show
Mott insulating behavior where the low energy physics
can also be described by a half ﬁlled single band model7–9.
It has been suggested that doped iridate Mott insula-
tors could be avenues to search for high temperature
superconductivity10. Sr2IrO4 is a specially attractive
material because it has the same crystal structure as
11, and many of its magnetic properties are sim-
La2CuO4
ilar to the cuprates11,12. Electron doping of Sr2IrO4 has
been successfully achieved by creating oxygen deﬁcient
13. While these samples be-
single crystals Sr2IrO4−x
come metallic and show signiﬁcant changes in their mag-
netic properties, no superconductivity has thus far been
observed13. Recently in situ surface electron doping by
potassium deposition has also been achieved and it was
found that Fermi arcs, pseudogap, and a low tempera-
ture d-wave gap exist for these samples demonstrating
properties in complete analogy with the cuprates14–16.
The more traditional signatures of superconductivity like
zero resistance state and the Meissner eﬀect have still
not been observed for doped Sr2IrO4. Nevertheless, the
strong dependence of electronic and magnetic properties
of Sr2IrO4 with small doping suggests that properties of
iridates could be highly tunable.

Recently, the family of layered honeycomb lattice iri-
dates A2IrO3(A = Na, Li) has garnered a lot of atten-
tion. In these materials spin-orbit entangled eﬀective mo-
ments Jef f = 1/2 sit on a honeycomb lattice leading to
novel magnetic properties8,17–20. Na2IrO3 which is elec-
trically insulating with a band gap of 350 meV 21 shows
frustrated magnetism as evidenced by a long range mag-
netic ordering temperature TN = 15 K which is much re-
duced compared to the Weiss temperature θ = −120 K18.
There is now direct evidence of dominant bond direc-
tional exchange interactions in Na2IrO3 suggesting that
Kitaev like exchanges maybe dominant in this system22.

spin-triplet

Unconventional

superconductivity and
topological superconductivity have been predicted to
emerge with doping in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model
on the honeycomb lattice23–27. Additionally, spin and
charge density wave, spin/charge bond-order, and elec-
tronic dimerization instabilities have been predicted with
varying doping26. The honeycomb lattice ruthenates and
iridates are already close to coupled structural, magnetic,
and orbital instabilities as evidenced by Ru-Ru dimer-
28 and in A2IrO3 (A =Li, Na) under
ization in Li2RuO3
small pressures29.

In this work we report the discovery that the surface
of Na2IrO3 crystals turns metallic when we expose it to
high energy Ar Plasma. With varying exposure times (0–
30 minutes) we can enhance the conductivity by several
orders of magnitude and go from an insulating surface
to a metallic one. The samples etched for 5 minutes re-
main insulating although the charge gap is reduced. The
10 minute etched samples show behaviour between that
of insulators and metals with a weak increase in resis-
tance on cooling below 300 K before becoming temper-
ature independent below about 200 K and having ﬁnite
values as T → 0. The metallic Na2IrO3 samples obtained
for larger than 10 minutes plasma etching show exotic
ﬁrst order phase transitions reminiscent of spin/charge
density wave (S/CDW) or structural transitions. Specif-
ically the 20 minute sample shows an abrupt increase in
the sheet resistance Rs at To = 220 K while cooling. This
DW-like transition occurs at 230 K while warming. Sur-
prisingly, the magnitude of the increase in Rs at To is
magnetic ﬁeld dependent suggesting that spin degrees of
freedom are involved. For the most metallic 30 minute
sample, around T = 95 K we observe a step-transition
below which Rs falls by more than an order of magni-
tude. This is also a ﬁrst order transition as we observe
a hysteresis of ≈ 10 K between the cooling and warming
data. For the 30 minute etched samples the Rs(T ) data
below T = 10 K could be ﬁt to a T 2 behavior which sug-
gests normal Fermi liquid behavior. These S/CDW-like
transitions on doping Na2IrO3 are consistent with recent
predictions26.

The single crystalline Na2IrO3 were synthesized as de-

scribed elsewhere18. The surface of the plate-like crys-
tals were modiﬁed by bombarding a freshly cleaved sur-
face with high energy Argon (Ar) plasma for varying
amounts of time ranging from 0 to 40 minutes. The de-
tails of the parameters used for this plasma treatment is
given in Table I. The surface structure of the crystals be-
fore and after the plasma treatment was measured using
grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS).
The chemical composition of the sample surface before
and after the plasma treatment was checked using en-
ergy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis with a JEOL scan-
ning electron microscope (SEM). The electrical transport
was measured using a Quantum Design physical prop-
erty measurement system in the temperature range 2 K
to 305 K.

Before we present our results we would like to note the
following points. The etched surfaces degrade in lab at-
mosphere. The changes in the transport properties on
etching are thus temporary and revert back to their orig-
inal behaviour after exposure of the etched surface to lab
atmosphere. The time taken for the etched surfaces to
degrade and revert back to insulating behaviour is about
1–2 days for the samples etched for 10 minutes. This
time gets shorter for longer etching times. The samples
etched for 40 minutes degrade in about an hour. The
transport of the crystal surface opposite to the etched
surface does not change and remains highly insulating.
Additionally, if a fresh surface was exposed by cleaving oﬀ
the etched surface, it showed insulating behaviour simi-
lar to undoped Na2IrO3. These observations suggest that
varying depths of the Na2IrO3 are aﬀected with varying
etching times and most likely only a small depth close to
the top surface is modiﬁed.

We have looked at the surface structure of Na2IrO3
using grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering
(GISAXS) measurements before and after the etching.
The depth D probed in GISAXS measurements is given
as D = d Sinθ, where d is the attenuation length for
this compound at the given x-ray energy, and θ is the
incidence angle measured from the surface. We estimate
D ≈ 20 nm with d ≈ 1.25 × 103 cm at X-ray energy
15 keV and θ = 0.1o. Representative GISAXS patterns
of two samples before and after the plasma etching are
shown in Fig 1.
It is known through scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy (STM) measurements that the surface
structure of Na2IrO3 is diﬀerent from the bulk due to
surface reconstruction30. Nevertheless, a comparison of
the GISAXS patterns before and after the plasma treat-

ment suggests that the overall surface structure does not
change after etching. The most signiﬁcant change is for
the peak at high angles (33–34o) which shifts to slightly
smaller angles after etching suggesting that the cell pa-
rameter contributing to this peak increases. However,
there is no systematic evolution of the peak position with
etching time. For all etched samples, the peak position is
approximately the same and smaller (in angle) than the
corresponding peak in the unexposed Na2IrO3 surface by
≈ 0.5o.

Chemical analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy
on several spots of the crystals before and after the
plasma etching gave the average chemical composition
given in the Table II. From these results it is clear that
Na is progressively being removed with increasing etch-
ing times. Therefore, the plasma etching leads to hole
doping (of the surface at least).

Since the thickness of the surface layer aﬀected by the
etching is unknown and most likely depends on the etch-
ing time, we present electrical transport as sheet resis-
tance Rs given in the units Ω/sq. A sheet resistance of
1Ω/sq means that a square sheet will have a resistance
of 1Ω regardless of the size of the square.

Transport for the sample etched for 40 minutes could
not be measured as the sample surface degraded within
an hour before contacts could be made and cured. The

samples are shown on a semi-log scale in Fig. 2 to high-
light the change in Rs by several orders of magnitude
with increasing etching times. The sample exposed for
5 minutes remains insulating although the band gap re-
duces to ≈ 1400 K compared to ≈ 3600 K for Na2IrO3
estimated from a ﬁt (not shown) of the Rs(T ) data to an
activated Arrhenius behaviour.

Figure 3 shows the Rs(T ) data for two single crystals
etched for 10 minutes. While the Rs values for the two
samples are diﬀerent by about an order of magnitude or
less, the qualitative T dependence is very similar with an
increase on cooling from T = 300 K, a broad maximum
reached around 150–200 K, after which the Rs is very
weakly T dependent. For the sample with the lower re-
sistance, the behaviour below the maximum is actually
metallic.

Figure 4 (a) shows the zero magnetic ﬁeld Rs(T ) data
measured while cooling the sample exposed for 20 min-
utes. Resistance increases on cooling below 300 K and
reaches a maximum around 240 K. At To ≈ 220 K, there

the resistivity. Below To, metallic behavior is recovered
down to 20 K below which there is a slight increase in
Rs(T ). The step-like increase in Rs(T ) at To is similar to
the behavior observed for charge density wave transitions
where the increase in Rs results from a partial loss of den-
sity of states due to the opening up of a gap at the Fermi
surface33. The transition at To is ﬁrst-order as indicated
by the hysteresis of about 10 K between the cooling and
warming curves shown in Fig. 4 (a) inset. The transition
is broadened out in the warming curve. This behaviour
was observed in repeated measurements and is intrinsic.
An additional feature which is not observed in conven-
tional CDW systems is the magnetic ﬁeld dependence.

ing in various magnetic ﬁelds H. Above To there is no H
dependence and all data fall on top of each other. How-

nitude of Rs(T ) on the application of ﬁeld although the
qualitative behaviour remains the same. The magnitude
of the step-like increase in Rs(To) also increases with H
as seen in Fig. 4 (b) inset.

Figures 5 (a) and (b) show the Rs(T ) data, measured
while cooling, for two crystals exposed for 30 minutes.
While the details are diﬀerent, the qualitative behaviour
for these two samples is the same. On cooling one ﬁnds an
increase in Rs(T ), a maximum around 250–275 K, metal-
lic behaviour down to To ≈ 95 K where an abrupt step-
like decrease in Rs(T ) by more than an order of magni-
tude occurs signalling a density wave-like transition. This
metal-to-metal transition is ﬁrst order in nature as seen
from the thermal hysteresis of about 10 K between warm-
ing and cooling measurements shown in Fig. 5 (a) inset I.

The lowest temperature Rs(T ) data follow an approxi-
mately T 2 behaviour expected for a Fermi liquid metal.
This is shown in Fig. 5 (a) inset II and Fig. 5 (b) inset,
where the solid curve through the data are ﬁts to a T 2
dependence. Unlike for the 20 minute sample, there is
no magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the resistivity for the
30 minute sample as seen in Fig. 5 (a) inset III which
shows the Rs(T ) data between 2 K and 150 K in a mag-
netic ﬁeld of 1 T and 9 T.
Summary and Discussion: We have shown that the sur-
face of Na2IrO3 crystals are highly tunable using plasma
etching. We were able to change the surface conductivity
by several orders of magnitude by varying the plasma ex-
posure time. Speciﬁcally we studied samples irradiated
for times t = 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes. GISAXS measure-
ments showed that the surface structure does not change
after the etching and EDS chemical analysis revealed
that Na was being progressively removed on increasing
the etching time. The samples etched for 10 minutes
showed unusual transport behavior with an increase in
resistivity Rs on cooling from 300 K down to 150–200 K
below which Rs(T ) became almost T -independent (see
Fig. 3). This behavior is consistent with that expected for
topological insulators where at low temperatures surface
conductivity starts contributing after the bulk becomes
suﬃciently insulating.
It must be noted that topologi-
cal insulating state has been predicted for Na2IrO3 un-
der certain conditions31,32. Whether this behaviour in
doped Na2IrO3 has any topological properties will have
to be explored in more detailed surface sensitive studies
in future.

The samples etched for 20 and 30 minutes show bad-
metal behavior at high temperature with large values
(∼ Ω) and with an increasing Rs(T ) with decreasing
T . The Rs(T ) passes over a maximum around 250 K
and turns metallic for lower temperatures. For the
20(30) minute samples, we observe abrupt step-like in-
crease(decrease) in Rs(T ) at To ≈ 220(95) K. These are
ﬁrst-order transitions as revealed by a 10 K thermal hys-
teresis. These signatures in electrical transport are rem-
iniscent of spin or charge density wave transitions33–44.
Usually, at a charge density wave transition, a periodic
lattice distortion is accompanied by a (partial) gapping
of the Fermi surface. This leads to an increased resis-
tance below the CDW transition33,34,37,39. This is con-
sistent with the feature observed at ≈ 220 K for the
20 minute etched sample. However, a drop in resistiv-
ity, as seen at ≈ 95 K for the 30 minute etched sample,
is hard to explain as arising from a CDW transition with
a gapping mechanism. Nevertheless, prominent exam-
ples of this behaviour are known to exist. For example,
the resistivity for 2H- TaS2 at the CDW transition at
75 K40, for 4H-TaS2 at the CDW transition at 22 K41,
and for Er5Ir4Si10 at the CDW transition at 55 K42, drop
abruptly. The mechanism leading to the drop in resistiv-
ity at the CDW transition not understood fully although
it was speculated in the case of Er5Ir4Si10 that the lat-
tice modulation led to a band structure which led to en-

hanced conductivity42. The CDW transitions accompa-
nied by periodic lattice distortions in all these materials
have been veriﬁed and demonstrated through electron
diﬀraction measurements.

The magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the two proposed
density wave-like transitions are also diﬀerent. While
the resistance at and below the transition at 220 K for
the 20 minute sample is ﬁeld dependent, there is no ef-
fect of the ﬁeld on the resistance of the 30 minute etched
sample across the transition at 95 K. There are again
examples of both kind of behaviours observed for well
established spin and charge density wave materials and
the details of the electronic structure, electron-phonon
coupling, and DW instability mechanism govern whether
a ﬁeld will have any eﬀect on the transport properties
or not. For example, the resistance at and below the
lower CDW transition in NbSe3 is strongly enhanced by
a magnetic ﬁeld and even the transition temperature is
increased by a small amount35. This has been suggested
to happen because the magnetic ﬁeld improves the imper-
fect nesting which already existed at zero ﬁeld. The im-
proved nesting in an applied ﬁeld leads to a larger portion
of the Fermi surface becoming gapped and hence leads
to a larger resistance below the CDW transition35. On
the other hand, in the 1-dimensional organic conductor
TTF-TCNQ, the resistance at and below the 58 K CDW
transition and indeed the transition temperature itself is

suppressed on the application of a magnetic ﬁeld43. This
can be understood in terms of the competition of the Zee-
man splitting of the nested bands in a ﬁeld and the CDW
gap in analogy to the breaking of Cooper pairs in BCS
superconductivity45. Similar suppression of CDW with
magnetic ﬁeld has been reported for another 1-D organic
conductor Per2[Au(mnt)2]46. Additionally, there could
be magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects at a CDW transition if there is
a coupled SDW state occurring simultaneously. This is
seen at the SDW transition in metallic Chromium44.

Thus, the transport anomalies observed for doped
Na2IrO3 are consistent with spin or charge density wave
transitions. Remarkably, such spin and charge density
waves, spin/charge bond-order, and structural instabili-
ties have been predicted for the doped Kitaev-Heisenberg
26. Further experimental
model relevant for Na2IrO3
work and in particular surface sensitive probes like STM
would be useful to reveal the nature and origin of the
remarkable features seen in doped Na2IrO3.
