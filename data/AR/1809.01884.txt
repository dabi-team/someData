ABSTRACT
We present detailed optical photo-polarimetric observations of the recently-discovered
white dwarf pulsar AR Scorpii. Our extensive dataset reveals that the polarized emis-
sion is remarkably stable and repeatable with spin, beat and orbital modulations. This
has enabled us to construct a simple geometrical model which assumes that all of the
optically polarized emission emanates from two diametrically opposed synchrotron
emission regions on the white dwarf magnetosphere. We suggest that the observed
polarimetric modulations occur as a result of an enhanced injection of relativistic elec-
trons into the magnetosphere of the white dwarf as it sweeps past the M-dwarf. This
leads to an increase in synchrotron emission as the injected electrons accelerate towards
each magnetic mirror point close to the magnetic poles of the white dwarf. Whilst this
scenario reproduces the detailed polarimetric modulations, other suggested scenarios
involving emission sites locked in the white dwarf rotating frame are not ruled out.
For example, pulsar-like particle acceleration as a result of either electric potentials
between the white dwarf and the light cylinder or a striped relativistic magnetohydro-
dynamic wind, outside the light cylinder. Previous conclusions that argued that the
observed strong optical beat modulations require that the optical polarization arises
predominantly from or near the M-dwarf are inconsistent with our observations.

1 INTRODUCTION

The discovery of pulsar-like behaviour in the close binary
system AR Scorpii (hereafter AR Sco) has ﬁrmly demon-
strated that white dwarfs can exhibit many of the same char-
acteristics as neutron star pulsars. Marsh et al. (2016) were
the ﬁrst to discover highly pulsed (up to 90% pulse fraction)
non-thermal emission from the spinning white dwarf in AR
Sco, over a wavelength range extending from radio to the
ultraviolet. These pulsations are seen predominantly at the
118 s beat period between the 117 s spin period and the 3.6
h orbital period of the binary. Perhaps the most intriguing
aspect was that Marsh et al. (2016) concluded that the bulk
of the luminosity of the system was a result of spin-down
power of the white dwarf, for which they measured a spin-
down of (cid:219)P = 3.92×10−13 s s−1. However a recent reevaluation
(Potter & Buckley 2018) of the spin ephemeris shows that
the proposed spin-down ephemeris derived by Marsh et al.
(2016) is inconsistent with newer and higher cadence obser-
vations over a 2 year timebase, which formally requires no

(cid:219)P term. This implies that the spin-evolution of the white
dwarf is still an open question, in particular what the actual
value of spin-down power is.

The overall spectral energy distribution of AR Sco was
shown by Marsh et al. (2016) to be dominated by two non-
thermal power law (Sν ∝ να) components, although the ther-
mal contribution from the M5 companion is also evident.
From radio to infrared frequencies (ν ≤ 1012 − 1013 Hz) the
power law slope is α ∼ 1.3, typical of self absorbed syn-
chrotron emission, while for higher optical to X-ray frequen-
cies (ν ≥ few × 1014 Hz), α ∼ −0.2 (Marsh et al. 2016; Geng
et al. 2016). However, the highest frequency (X-ray) con-
straint was quite loose, based only a short Swift ToO obser-
vation. More recent observations of AR Sco have extended
the wavelength range and/or time coverage and sensitivity.
X-ray observations with XMM-Newton, reported by Takata
et al. (2017), shows both orbital and beat variations and an
X-ray spectrum characterized by a hot multi-temperature
thermal plasma (kT ∼ 1 − 8 keV, Takata et al. (2017)). Mar-
cote et al. (2017) and Stanway et al (2018) have presented
results of radio observations of AR Sco, namely high reso-
lution interferometry and time resolved eVLA observations,

respectively. The source was unresolved in the former ob-
servation, while strong modulations of the radio ﬂux on the
orbital and beat periods were reported for the latter. Long
cadence optical photometry, utilizing Kepler data, has been
reported in Littleﬁeld et al. (2017).

The strong spin modulated emission due to the white
dwarf plus the dominant non-thermal nature of the SED
led to the initial conclusions that magnetic interactions were
powering the emission in AR Sco (Marsh et al. 2016; Geng et
al. 2016; Katz 2017), in many respects resembling the emis-
sion from pulsars. Further evidence of pulsar behaviour fol-
lowed from photopolarimetric observations by Buckley et al.
(2017), who detected spin and beat modulated linear polar-
ization as high as 40%. They interpreted the characteristics
of the polarized and non-polarized emission in terms of syn-
chrotron emission from two diﬀerent regions, one associated
with the rotating white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld and the other
as a result of MHD interactions with the M-dwarf compan-
ion. A number of models have now been suggested to explain
the observed behaviour of AR Sco (Marsh et al. 2016; Geng
et al. 2016; Katz 2017; Buckley et al. 2017; Takata et al.
2017, 2018), based on some kind of white dwarf−red dwarf
interaction, resulting in emission from the surface or coronal
loops of the companion star, its magnetosphere or possibly
through an associated bow shock (Geng et al. 2016; Katz
2017).

The eVLA results reported in Stanway et al (2018)
showed strong beat-phase pulsations at 9 GHz, decreasing
in strength with decreasing frequency. Unlike the optical po-
larized emission (Buckley et al. 2017), the radio emission
shows only weak linear polarization but very strong circular
polarization, reaching ∼30%. Stanway et al (2018) postulate
the existence of a non-relativistic cyclotron emission compo-
nent, dominating at radio frequencies, which given the likely
magnetic ﬁeld strength of the emission region, arises in the
vicinity of the M-dwarf.

In this paper we present new extensive optical polari-
metric results from ∼65 h of observations over a period of
two consecutive years. We derive a high quality high resolu-
tion periodogram for the polarimetric variations which, al-
though appearing to be quite complex, is entirely explained
by the presence of just two basic periodicities, namely the
spin frequency (ω) and the orbital frequency (Ω), together
with the sideband frequencies (ν = m.ω ± n.Ω, where m, n
are integers), their aliases and harmonics. We present a sim-
ple geometric model based on synchrotron emission in the
magnetosphere of the white dwarf which can qualitatively
explain the polarized emission as a function of orbital, spin
and beat phase.

2 OBSERVATIONS

In Table 1 we show a log of all the observations of AR
Sco which were made with the HI-speed Photo-POlarimeter
(HIPPO; Potter et al. (2010)) on the 1.9-m telescope of the
South African Astronomical Observatory. We have already
reported on the high speed photometry results obtained dur-
ing this observing campaign (Potter & Buckley 2018). This
paper can be consulted for details of the instrument and
observational setup. In summary, HIPPO was operated in
“all-stokes” mode, simultaneously measuring all four Stokes

0.1 s. These data were then binned to a time resolution of
10 s before undertaking further analysis.

Several polarized and non-polarized standard stars (Hsu
& Breger 1982; Bastien et al. 1988) were observed in order
to calculate the position angle oﬀsets, instrumental polariza-
tion and eﬃciency factors. Photometric calibrations were not
carried out; photometry is given as total counts. Background
sky polarization measurements were taken at frequent inter-
vals during the observations.

3 THE PHOTO-POLARIMETRY

In Fig. 1 we present an example of one of our observations,
namely on the night of 2016 May 27 taken with the clear ﬁl-
ter. The top and bottom panels show, respectively, the simul-
taneous photometry (presented in Potter & Buckley (2018))
and linearly polarized counts. In both plots of Fig. 1 we see
both the low frequency high amplitude orbital modulation,
covering ∼2 cycles, plus the strong beat and spin pulses at
a period of ∼2 minutes and the ﬁrst harmonic at half this
period. We also show in the ﬁgure insets expanded sections
of the observations, which present spin/beat modulations in
more detail. Both the photometry and polarimetry are con-
sistent with the results reported by Marsh et al. (2016) and
Buckley et al. (2017), respectively, although those data do
not cover entire orbital cycles.

In Potter & Buckley (2018) we presented a method to
graphically demonstrate how the beat and spin variations
are modulated on the orbital period. In Fig.2 we show a very
similar plot to one presented in that paper, but extended to
show the details of the spin and beat modulated polarization
behaviour. In summary, these are in the form of a 2D colour
coded image of the pulse proﬁles, where the details of how
they were derived are presented in Potter & Buckley (2018).
We refer to these henceforth as “dynamic pulse proﬁles”. The
top two panels in Fig. 2, which show the photometric obser-
vations, are a reproduction of Figure 2 of Potter & Buckley
(2018) and are included here to allow easy comparison be-
tween the total ﬂux and the polarized ﬂux behaviour. These
dynamic pulse proﬁle images are extremely stable over time

Figure 1. An example dataset, speciﬁcally the ∼6.8 hours, clear ﬁltered photo-polarimetric observations of 27 May 2016. Top and
bottom panels are the photometry and total linear counts respectively. The spin and beat pulses can clearly be seen in the insets which
correspond to ∼30 minute expanded views, indicated by the grey regions.

and show exactly the same morphology from one orbital cy-
cle to another, even if separated by over 1 year. Therefore in
order to improve the signal to noise of these images, we have
combined all of our white-light (“clear”) observations, which
is by far the largest dataset, to produce the ﬁnal version of
Fig. 2.

The dynamic pulse proﬁles show that the double-peaked
spin and beat pulses evolve in amplitude over the orbital
cycle peaking at ∼0.4−0.5 in orbital phase and signiﬁcantly
reduced at orbital phase ∼0. There also appears to be a sec-
ond set of double pulses (spin and beat) between orbital
phases ∼0.6−1.0. The spin and beat pulses also appear not
to be stable in phase, i.e. the spin and beat pulses appear
to drift later and earlier respectively as a function of orbital
phase, giving the diagonal appearance. The ”slopes” of the
diagonal pulses in the spin/beat-orbit phase-space is consis-
tent with cross ”contamination” between the spin and beat
frequencies.

The second two panels of Fig. 2 show the simultaneous
linearly polarized ﬂux. These were constructed by phase-
fold binning in the same manner as the photometric ﬂux.
The linear polarization displays similar double peaked-spin
and beat amplitude variations to the photometry. In par-
ticular the amplitude of the peaks are strongest around or-
bital phases ∼0.2−0.5 and the spin and beat pulses appear
to drift later and earlier respectively as a function of orbital
phase, giving the diagonal appearance. However, the linear
pulses also appear to be doubled compared to the photomet-

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2017)

ric pulses. e.g. the main photometric spin pulse centered on
orbital/spin phase ∼0.35/0.15 appears diagonally split into
two at the corresponding location in the linear polarization
image. The second smaller photometric peak centered on or-
bital/spin phase ∼0.4/0.65 is similarly diagonally split into
two linear polarization peaks.

The beat pulses are likewise split, but more in the ver-
tical (orbital) direction. A close inspection of the orbit-beat
phase linear polarization image one can see a “darker” di-
agonal band running from the top left to the bottom right
and passing through the center of the fainter of the “split”
peaks. A less obvious parallel band dark band can be seen
passing through the center of the brighter split peak. These
darker bands are indicative of a minimum non-zero amount
of polarized ﬂux at these phases.

The third row of panels in Fig. 2 show the simultane-
ous circularly polarized ﬂux also phase-folded and binned
in the same manner as the photometry and linear polariza-
tion. The amount of circular polarization is at a much lower
level than the linear polarization. Individual light curves
(not shown) show only occasional seemingly random excur-
sions of circular polarization, peaking at values of ∼3 per-
cent. The co-adding of the multiple data sets reveals that
there are regions in the orbit, spin/beat phase space where
circular polarization is preferentially seen. Speciﬁcally, posi-
tive and negative circular polarization (red and blue regions
regions respectively) appear to have maximum values cen-
tered on the orbital/spin phases ∼0.4/0.65 and ∼0.4/0.15

respectively. These coincide with the maximum peaks in the
photometry and the centers on the “split” linear polariza-
tion peaks. Comparing the left and right third panels also
reveals that the orbit, beat image has the diagonal structures
of similar orientation to those present in the photometry and
linear polarization. However, in comparison, the orbit, spin
circular polarization structures appear to be more vertically
orientated suggesting that the circular polarization is spin
dominated.

The bottom two panels of Fig. 2 show the simultane-
ous position angle of linear polarization, also phase-folded
and binned in the same manner as the photometry, linear
and circular polarization of Fig. 2. The colour coding rep-
resents position angle. The orbit-spin image shows vertical
features consistent with spin dominated position angle vari-
ations, i.e. lines of constant position angle run along lines of
constant spin phase. The position angle appears to rotate
twice through 180 degrees over the course of one spin cycle.
The orbit-beat image (right panel of Fig. 2) conﬁrms the spin
dominance of position angle by exhibiting diagonal lines of
constant angle: these would otherwise appear vertical if the
position angle varied at the beat period.

4 FOURIER ANALYSIS

We subjected the entire time series of linearly polarized ﬂux
to a Fourier analysis and present the amplitude spectrum of
this data in Fig. 3. All of the peaks in the amplitude spec-
trum were able to be identiﬁed with the known periodicities.
Multiple harmonics of the spin (ω) and beat (ω−Ω) frequen-
cies are clearly identiﬁed as well as the spin−orbit sideband
combinations of the spin and orbital frequencies, which are
expected to occur at frequencies ν = m.ω ± n.Ω, where m &
n are integers. We see that the spectrum is heavily aliased
due to daily, weekly, monthly and yearly gaps in the dataset
and is very similar to the photometric amplitude spectra
presented in Potter & Buckley (2018) for the total intensity,
I.

Potter & Buckley (2018) described a technique of
searching all the amplitudes of the spin, orbit and sidebands
variations and harmonics as a function of spin and orbit fre-
quency parameter space in order to decide which are the
most likely periods. Despite there being several aliases, not
all of them have corresponding amplitude peaks at the var-
ious spin/orbit/sideband frequencies and harmonics, result-
ing in a reduced “summed amplitude”. See Potter & Buck-
ley (2018) for further details and how it was applied to the
photometric observations. This technique allows all possi-
ble information on the periodicities, based on the identiﬁ-
cation of the two fundamental ω and Ω frequencies, their
sidebands and harmonics, to be combined to produce the
highest signal-to-noise and best resolution period peak in
the combined amplitude spectrum. The frequency resolu-
tion is then deﬁned by the highest frequency signal present
in the data set, which is the 4th harmonic of the spin or beat
periods.

In Fig. 4 we show the results of the technique applied
to our linear polarization data. The tallest peak is consis-
tent with the tallest photometric peak from Potter & Buck-
ley (2018), occurring at the beat frequency. There are other
smaller but comparable peaks located at the ∼1 year aliases,

Figure 2. Dynamic pulse proﬁle images showing how the spin
and beat modulations of total intensity and polarization param-
eters change with orbital phase. These represent the averaged
phase-folded data from 14, 25, 26, 27 May 2016 and 27, 28 March
2017, showing (from top to bottom), total ﬂux, linearly polarized
ﬂux, circularly polarized ﬂux and position angle of the linear po-
larization vector. The linearly polarized ﬂux has been normalised,
while circularly polarized ﬂux has not. See text for description of
labeled rectangles.

however Potter & Buckley (2018) have shown that these are
signiﬁcantly reduced in the similar photometric analysis that
consisted of a longer dataset. Furthermore we ﬁnd that the
polarimetry does not require a spin-derivative to correctly
phase our datasets over the 2 year time base as was found
for the photometry (Potter & Buckley 2018).

5 THE SPIN MODULATED POLARIZATION

In order to extract the weaker spin modulated linear po-
larization signal (e.g. see Buckley et al. (2017)), we pre-
whitened our polarimetric time series to remove the eﬀects of
the stronger beat modulation. This was done by a non-linear
least squares ﬁt of multiple sinusoids ﬁxed at the sideband
frequencies and their harmonics, determined in the previ-
ous section. Only the amplitudes and phases were allowed
to vary in the ﬁtting procedure.

In Fig. 5 we show the results of the pre-whitening, in the

the black curves are magniﬁed views centered on the spin and beat
frequencies and the spin harmonics, re-scaled in frequency space
with respect to the spin fundamental (e.g. the frequencies cen-
tered on 2ω were divided by 2, etc). Individual peaks represent
the 1 cycle/year aliases. These rescaled amplitude peaks (includ-
ing others identiﬁed in Fig. 3 but not plotted here) were then
summed to produce the red curve. All spectra have been ver-
tically displaced to aid visualization. The vertical black dashed
line indicates the location of the spin and beat harmonics using
the center of the tallest peak in the summed red spectrum. It
also coincides with the photometric spin frequency determined in
(Potter & Buckley 2018).

synchrotron emission source(s) in the binary frame. We at-
tempted a few models that placed the synchrotron emission
source ﬁxed in the binary frame e.g. on the irradiated face
of the secondary star or a bow shock. We were unable to
reproduce the morphology of the polarimetric modulations
using such emission sites. Speciﬁcally we could not construct
a model that reproduces the detailed linear polarized struc-
tures labeled as regions a1, a2, b1 and b2 in Fig. 2., the ori-
entation of the circular polarized structures and also, very
importantly, the position angle dependence. We would ex-
pect to see more vertical structures in the beat dynamic
pulse proﬁles if the emission regions were located at or near
the secondary star.

Finally we considered scenarios where the emission re-
gions are locked in the white dwarf rotating frame. One such
scenario involves relativistic electrons accelerating from the
vicinity of the secondary star towards the white dwarf. Buck-
ley et al. (2017) and Takata et al. (2017) have suggested that
magnetic interaction on the surface of the companion star
heats its stellar surface. Furthermore, Takata et al. (2017)
proposed that this interaction produces an outﬂow of elec-
trons with relativistic energies. The electrons are injected
and trapped in closed magnetic ﬁeld lines of the white dwarf.
Most of the relativistic electrons are captured by ﬁeld lines
from the magnetic pole that happens to point towards the
secondary as it sweeps past it, giving rise to bright syn-
chrotron emission. However, some electrons ﬂow in the op-
posite direction, along the same magnetic ﬁeld lines, towards
the opposite magnetic pole which also produces polarized

ﬂux obtained with HIPPO in 2016 and 2017. The panels show
the amplitude spectrum centered on regions around the orbital,
beat, spin and sideband frequencies, plus their harmonics. The
blue lines indicate the spin frequency and its harmonics while
the solid red lines indicate the beat frequency and its harmonics.
The dashed red lines indicate other sideband frequencies. One day
aliases are indicated by the vertical grey bars, while the ∼15 day
aliases are also visible, particularly in the top panel, as separated
black period peaks. The amplitude spectrum also contains ∼1 year
aliasing, which are unresolved in this ﬁgure, but are plainly seen
in high resolution plots, like in Fig.4.

same manner as shown in Fig. 2. Removal of the sideband
frequencies, predominantly the ω − Ω beat frequency, en-
hances the spin modulation at all orbital phases, albeit at a
lower relative level in the range φor b = 0.6−1.2. The bottom
panels show the orbitally average pre-whitened linear polar-
ization intensity curves, for both the spin and beat periods.
The spin folded curve reveals structures that are stable over
the orbital phase implying emission region(s) ﬁxed in the
white dwarf rotating frame.

6 PROPOSED MODEL

We consider a simple model, based on geometrical compo-
nents only, in order to explain the spin, beat and orbital
modulations of the polarized emission which is understood
to be of synchrotron in origin e.g. Marsh et al. (2016), Geng
et al. (2016), Buckley et al. (2017), Katz (2017), Takata
et al. (2017). The characteristics of our model for the po-
larized emission ultimately depends on the location of the

phase before and after pre-whitening. The top two panels are the
un-pre-whitened data, as in the 2nd panels of Fig. 2. For the
middle two panels the data was pre-whitened by the beat period
and its various harmonics. The bottom two panels show all the
data binned on the spin and beat period, summed over all orbital
phases.

synchrotron emission, but at at a lower level. Takata et al.
(2017) reasoned that the relativistic electrons do not reach
the surface of the white dwarf but instead emit synchrotron
emission as they reach magnetic mirror points on approach
to the white dwarf. These electrons are reﬂected and may
end up being re-captured by the secondary star or acceler-
ating back towards the opposite magnetic pole.

The synchrotron emission from accelerating electrons
trapped on magnetic ﬁled lines is depicted in the upper
schematic of Fig. 6. The synchrotron emission is “beamed”
in the direction of motion of the relativistic electrons, result-
ing in total intensity as well as linear and circular polarized
pulses as the white dwarf rotates (Fig. 6, lower schematic).
The beaming pattern for the linearly polarized emission
from relativistic electrons takes on a double peaked pro-
ﬁle, whereas the the circularly polarized emission is beamed
along the direction of the relativistic electrons. The amount
by which the emission is beamed depends on the Lorentz
factor (γ) of the relativistic electrons. Observationally, other
factors, such as the system inclination and the angle of the
dipole magnetic ﬁeld relative to the spin axis of the white
dwarf, will determine the observed characteristics of the
pulse proﬁle. As we will now explain, the critical feature
of the model is that the synchrotron emission region(s) are
locked and rotate with the spinning white dwarf.

For the simple model described above, after some ex-
perimentation we chose an inclination of 60o and a dipole
oﬀset angle of 40o. We settled on a synchrotron emission
proﬁle with a “beaming angle” of 45o, i.e. the peak in linear
polarization is seen at 45o from the magnetic ﬁeld direction,
indicated as ∼ 1/γ (albeit not to scale) in Fig.6. These pa-
rameters were iteratively chosen by hand in order to approx-
imately match the pulse proﬁle widths and separations as
seen in the observations. A more detailed exploration of the
parameter space through model ﬁtting is beyond the scope
of this work and we stress that the values chosen here are
by no means a unique solution, i.e. the model pulse widths
and their separations can be adjusted by tweaking any of
the three parameters described above, but the underlining
geometrical components and resulting emissions remain the
same.

Fig. 7 shows how a data set, produced by our simple
model for a single rotating synchrotron source (i.e. not in a
binary), would appear when phase-fold-binned in the same
manner as in Fig. 2. The left panels show that the spin-
pulses trace a vertical unchanging proﬁle as a function of
time (where Orbital Phase is a proxy for time in this single-
star case). The right hand panels show how these pulses
appear when folded on the beat frequency. As expected they
take on a diagonal appearance because the spin-modulated
pulses appear slightly earlier in beat-phase as a function of
time.

We next took into consideration the right-hand pan-
els of Fig. 2. (ﬁrst and second panels), which indicate that
the brightest pulses occur in the beat-phase range ∼0.9−0.1
(labeled as region a1). We adjusted our model such that
the total synchrotron intensity increases during those beat-
phases. This is depicted in Fig. 8 where the synchrotron
emission is intensiﬁed as the corresponding magnetic pole
(pole a) passes through the thick green area. However, from
the observer’s perspective, these pulses will appear brighter
during orbital phases ∼0.2−0.45 only, because of the beam-

Note that region
(a1) in the beat dynamic pulse-proﬁle transposes to region
(a1) in the spin dynamic pulse-proﬁle.

A possible astrophysical scenario for the increased
brightness is discussed later. Suﬃce to say that the beat-
phase dependency is a function of the angle between the WD
magnetic poles and the M-dwarf. Therefore it is as a result of
some astrophysical mechanism within the binary frame and
not observer viewing angle. We suggest that the magnetic
poles receive an enhanced injection of relativistic electrons
as they sweep past the M-dwarf, as suggested by Takata et
al. (2017). This subsequently results in an increase in syn-
chrotron emission as the electrons reach a magnetic mirror
point close to a magnetic pole of the WD. The beat-phase
range in which the increased emission occurs is indicted by
the green arc-like region in Fig. 8.

Fig. 9. shows the phase-folded-binned model data, with
the beat-phase constraint. Our model is now closer to recre-
ating some of the main features of the observations seen in
Fig. 2. Speciﬁcally within region (a1): the diagonal appear-
ances of the brighter intensity pulses in the spin and beat
dynamic pulse proﬁles (top 2 panels in Figs. 2 and 9), the
vertical separation of the double linear pulses in the beat
dynamic pulse proﬁle (2nd right panel of Figs. 2 and 9), the
diagonal separation of the double linear pulses in the spin
dynamic pulse proﬁle (2nd left panel of Figs. 2 and 9), the
diagonal and vertical regions of the negative (blue) circular
polarization in the beat and spin dynamic pulse proﬁles re-
spectively (3rd panels of Figs. 2 and 9). In our model the
peak in negative circular polarization occurs when pole (a)
is most pointing away from the observer during spin-phase
∼0.1-0.2, i.e. when the synchrotron beaming is most pointing
towards the observer.

So far we have considered the emission from a single
synchrotron emission region associated with one magnetic
pole only. As already indicated by Marsh et al. (2016) and
Buckley et al. (2017), Pulsar-like particle acceleration, the
observations are consistent with optical emission from two
synchrotron emission regions. Therefore we have added a
second, fainter, synchrotron emission region, associated with
the second magnetic pole (pole b) which is diametrically op-
posite the ﬁrst pole, as depicted in Fig. 8. Similar to the ﬁrst
pole we added the constraint of increasing the intensity of its
emission when the magnetic pole sweeps through the region
in the binary frame indicated by the same thick green area
in Fig. 8. This occurs over the beat-phase interval ∼0.3−0.55
(as deﬁned by the position of pole (a) in the binary frame)
and results in the emission region (b1) in Fig. 2.

Fig. 10 shows the beamed polarized emission from our
two synchrotron emission regions displayed as dynamical
pulse proﬁles in the same manner as the previous ﬁgures.
The addition of the second region has eﬀectively duplicated
a fainter version of the double pulsed emissions from the
ﬁrst region but with an oﬀset consistent with being diamet-
rically opposite. The peak of positive circular polarization
coincides with when the magnetic pole (b) is most pointing
away from the observer during spin-phase ∼0.65, i.e. when
the beamed emission is most pointing towards the observer.
However the positive circular emission is most enhanced
when pole (b) passes through the green region at beat phase
∼0.3−0.55 and most pointing towards the observer at orbital
phases∼0.2−0.45 (see 3rd panels of Figs 2 and 9).

Note that we have artiﬁcially adjusted the relative to-
tal intensities of the two synchrotron emission regions in
order to match the observations. Intrinsically the beamed
intensities of both synchrotron emission regions could be
roughly equal. However a combination of system inclination
and dipole oﬀset angle will result in one pole preferentially
beamed in the direction of the observer.

The bottom two panels of Fig. 10 show the model po-
sition angle of linear polarization, also phase-fold-binned in
the same manner as the total ﬂux, linear and circular po-
larized ﬂux. The spin-dynamic pulse proﬁle shows vertical
features consistent with spin dominated position angle vari-
ations as seen in the observations (Fig. 2), i.e. lines of con-
stant position angle have a constant spin phase. The position
angle appears to rotate twice through 180 degrees over the
course of one spin cycle, irrespective of orbital phase, as one
expects from the two emission regions. The beat dynamic
pulse-proﬁle conﬁrms the spin dominance of position angle
by exhibiting diagonal lies of constant position angle.

From Fig. 2. we have identiﬁed additional pulses not yet
accounted for in the model and are labeled as regions (a2)
and (b2). These pulses are seen during orbital phases ∼ 0.6-
1.1. We ﬁnd that the simplest explanation for the pulses is
that they are associated with additional beamed emission
from the smaller fraction of electrons that have ﬂowed in
the opposite direction along the same magnetic ﬁeld lines,
towards the opposite magnetic pole. For example, in Fig. 8.
the beamed emission (associated with region a1) is depicted
by the green lobe and is best viewed during orbital phases
∼ 0.2 − 0.45, as already discussed above. We have also added
beamed emission from the opposite magnetic pole, indicated
by the fainter green lobe near pole (b). As can be seen from
Fig. 8, the associated beamed emission is best viewed at
orbital phases ∼ 0.7-0.95 and is associated with region (b2)
in Fig. 2. Eﬀectively each magnetic pole, labeled as (a) and
(b), receives two injections of relativistic electrons. Injection
(1) occurs when the magnetic pole sweeps past the secondary
and injection (2) when it is diametrically opposite.

Therefore, similar to above, region (b1) in Fig. 2. is as
a result of pole (b) passing through the green enhancement
region where the beamed emission is from the ﬁrst magnetic
mirror point. Some relativistic electrons will also travel to
the opposite magnetic pole, this time associated with pole
(a) where the emission appears in region (a2) in Fig. 2.

Furthermore, a close inspection of the beat dynamic
pulse-proﬁle (Fig. 2. 2nd, right panel) reveals a diagonal nar-
row “dark” band running from the bottom right to the top
left, linking regions (b1) and (b2). This transposes to the
vertical band, centered on spin phase ∼0.65, in the corre-
sponding spin dynamic pulse-proﬁle and is understood as
the linear intensity dip between the linear pulses (see Fig.
6). We have not emulated the second electron injection in
our model, but it is clear from Fig. 10 that the underlin-
ing pulse emissions (and dark, narrow bands) are consistent
with this scenario.

Outside of the electron enhancement region (thick green
region in Fig. 8), a minimal level of emission is expected to
continue as electrons are trapped between the magnetic mir-
ror points. In particular, looking at Fig 8., our model pre-
dicts that during beat phase ranges ∼0.1−0.3 and ∼0.6−0.85,
neither magnetic pole is passing through the enhancement
region. This is veriﬁed in the observations which show dark

vertical bands (especially the linear ﬂux) during those phases
in the beat-pulse dynamic proﬁle (Fig. 2, second right panel).
These are transposed to the diagonal dark bands in the cor-
responding spin-pulse dynamic proﬁle (Fig. 2, second left
panel).

We have have shown that the scenario of electrons in-
jected from the secondary star into the magnetosphere of
the white dwarf would be consistent with our geometrical
model. However this does not preclude other scenarios in
which the synchrotron emission region(s) are ﬁxed and ro-
tate with the magnetosphere of the white dwarf. For ex-
ample, as noted by Buckley et al. (2017), pulsar-like par-
ticle acceleration can occur as a result of ∼ 1012V electric
potentials between the white dwarf and the light cylinder.
They also argue that striped relativistic magnetohydrody-
namic wind, outside the light cylinder, may also be present
which will also result in pulsar-like particle acceleration. As
long as the emission sites are ﬁxed in the white dwarf ro-
tating frame then these scenarios could also be consistent
with the observations. Our model depicted in Fig. 8. used
an enhanced injection of electrons from the secondary to
re-produce the detailed spin, beat and orbital modulations.
The orbital phase range at which the maximum amplitude
of the polarized pulses are observed is also consistent with
this scenario. The other scenarios would resemble something
similar to Fig. 11 and would require some other astrophysi-
cal mechanism to produce the detailed polarimetric modula-
tions. The fact that AR Sco is a binary system suggests that
the secondary star somehow inﬂuences the electric potentials
responsible for particle acceleration.

7 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

7.1 Spin, Beat and Orbital polarimetric

modulations

We present ∼65 hours of high-speed photo-polarimetric ob-
servations, spread over two successive observing seasons, of
the recently discovered white dwarf pulsar AR Scorpii. Our
observations conﬁrm the highly-polarized emission originally
reported by Buckley et al. (2017), from data with only par-
tial orbital coverage. It also shows deﬁnite detection of circu-
lar polarization, of both polarities, at a level of ∼ ±3 percent,
albeit only brieﬂy at spin phase 0.1 and 0.6. Our extensive
dataset covers multiple full orbits on several occasions over
almost two years. The observations reveal that the polarized
emission from AR Sco is remarkably repeatable between our
datasets. Speciﬁcally, the amplitudes of the polarized spin
and beat pulses are clearly modulated as a function of or-
bital phase. The corresponding Fourier analysis reveals am-
plitudes at the orbital frequency and multiple combinations
of the spin and beat pulses and their harmonics.

7.2 Geometrical synchrotron model

We present a model to explain the modulations of the po-
larized emission. The model assumes that all the polarized
emission emanates from two diametrically opposed magnetic
poles from the spinning white dwarf (WD). The amplitude of

the two spin pulses are modulated as a function of the rela-
tive angle between the magnetic poles and the secondary
star. Consequently the observer will measure larger spin
pulses at certain orbital phases leading to spin, beat and
orbital modulations. This model is not only consistent with
the observed polarized spin and beat intensities, but also re-
produces the position angle variations as a function of spin
and beat phase.

As pointed out by Geng et al. (2016), the number of
particles required to emit the observed pulsed optical emis-
sion is signiﬁcantly larger than can be supplied by the
WD itself. However, Takata et al. (2017) discuss a possi-
ble MHD scenario for modulating the synchrotron emission.
They argue that magnetic dissipation/reconnection on the
M-type star surface, as previously advocated in Buckley et
al. (2017), heats up the plasma to a temperature of several
keV. This leads to the acceleration of the electrons to rela-
tivistic speeds, some of which are trapped in the WD’s closed
magnetic ﬁeld lines. The observed pulsed component is then
explained by the synchrotron emissions from electrons ap-
proaching the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point, which also evolves
with orbital phase owing to the eﬀect of the viewing geome-
try. Our model is consistent with this scenario and, in addi-
tion, can account for a second group of fainter pulses due to
emission emanating from a smaller fraction of injected elec-
trons reaching the mirror point for the opposite magnetic
pole of the WD.

Whilst this scenario reproduces the detailed polarimet-
ric modulations, other scenarios involving emission sites
locked in the white dwarf rotating frame are also a possi-

bility. These would require some other astrophysical mecha-
nism to drive the detailed modulations. In may be possible
that both the white dwarf and the M-dwarf are sources of
charged particles which are accelerated and therefore multi-
ple mechanisms are contributing to the total polarization.

7.3 Radio emissions

As discussed in the introduction, Stanway et al (2018)
argued that unlike the optical emission, the radio emis-
sion shows weak linear polarization but very strong circu-
lar polarization and infer the probable existence of a non-
relativistic cyclotron emission component, which dominates
at low radio frequencies. Given the required lower magnetic
ﬁelds, this likely arises from or near the M-dwarf and is
therefore not co-located with the optical synchrotron emis-
sion.

7.4 UV and X-ray emissions

Takata et al. (2018) reported that the UV/X-ray emission
observed with (XMM-Newton) also shows orbital, beat and

the superior conjunction of the M-dwarf star’s orbit. These
properties are naturally explained by the emission from the
M-dwarf star and is consistent with a magnetic dissipa-
tion/reconnection process on the M-dwarf star’s surface that
heats up the plasma to several keV, which also accelerates
the electrons to relativistic speeds.
