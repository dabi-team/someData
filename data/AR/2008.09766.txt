ABSTRACT
The ﬁrst identiﬁcation of the argonium ion (ArH+) towards the Crab Nebula supernova remnant was pro-
claimed by the Herschel in the sub-millimeter and far-infrared domain. Very recently the discovery of the
hydro-helium cation (HeH+) in the planetary nebula (NGC 7027) has been reported by using the SOFIA. Ele-
mental abundance of neon is much more higher than that of the argon. However, the presence of neonium ions
(NeH+) is yet to be conﬁrmed in space. Though the hydroxyl radicals (−OH) are very abundant either in neutral
or in the cationic form, hydroxyl cations of such noble gases (i.e., ArOH+, NeOH+, and HeOH+) are yet to be
identiﬁed in space. Here, we employ a spectral synthesis code to examine the chemical evolution of the hydride
and hydroxyl cations of the various isotopes of Ar, Ne, and He in the Crab Nebula ﬁlament and calculate their
line emissivity and intrinsic line surface brightness. We successfully explain the observed surface brightness
of two transitions of ArH+ (617 and 1234 GHz), one transition of OH+ (971 GHz), and one transition of H2
(2.12 µm). We also explain the observed surface brightness ratios between various molecular and atomic tran-
sitions. We ﬁnd that our model reproduces the overall observed features when a hydrogen number density of
∼ (104 − 106) cm−3 and a cosmic-ray ionization rate per H2 of ∼ (10−11 − 10−10) s−1 are chosen. We discuss the
possibility of detecting some hydride and hydroxyl cations in the Crab and diﬀuse cloud environment. Some
transitions of these molecules are highlighted for future astronomical detection.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Crab Nebula, henceforth the Crab (M1 = NGC
1952) is the freely expanding remnant of the historical core-
collapse supernova of A.D. 1054 (SN1054) which contains
both atomic and molecular hydrogen, electrons, and a region
of enhanced ionized argon emission. The updated distance to
the Crab pulsar from the Sun is 3.37 kpc (Fraser & Boubert
2019) than previously obtained (2 kpc, Trimble 1968) with
RA and DEC 05h34m31.935s and +22◦0(cid:48)52(cid:48)(cid:48).19 respectively
(Kaplan et al. 2008). The Crab lies about 200 pc away from
the Galactic plane in a region of low density and it is too
young to be contaminated by the interstellar or circumstellar
material.

Hydrogen atoms are widespread in the universe. It is thus
no surprise that the hydrogenated species are ubiquitous. The

huge abundances of the molecular hydrogen could be ex-
plained by considering the physisorption process of interstel-
lar grains (Biham et al. 2001; Chakrabarti et al. 2006a,b). Nu-
merous strong H2 (2.12 µm) emitting knots have been iden-
tiﬁed in the Crab (Loh et al. 2010, 2011). Though the ki-
netic gas temperature around the knots of the Crab is around
∼ 2000−3000 K, Gomez et al. (2012) found that the cold and
hot component of the dust temperature can be ∼ 28 and 63 K,
respectively. Richardson et al. (2013) modeled emission fea-
tures of H2 in this environment. Due to the presence of strong
radiation in the Crab, electrons are highly abundant and can
readily convert H atoms into H−, which eventually react with
H atoms again to form the H2 molecules. Though there can
be some physicorption as well as chemisorption (Cazaux &
Tielens 2004) pathways as well which may lead to the H2
formation, the majority of the H2 molecules were formed on
the cleanest knot (knot 51) of the Crab by H + H− reaction
(Richardson et al. 2013).

Argon is the third most abundant species in the Earth’s at-
mosphere. However, instead of the most common isotope

of argon (36Ar, mainly produced by the stellar nucleosyn-
thesis in supernovae), in the Earth’s atmosphere, 40Ar iso-
tope is more common (mainly produced from the decay of
potassium-40 in the Earth’s crust). In the Earth’s atmosphere,
the isotopic ratio of 40Ar/38Ar/36Ar is 1584/1.00/5.30 (Lee
the ratio obtained in the
et al. 2006).
Jupiter family comet, 67P/C-G by ROSETTA mission using
ROSINA mass spectrometer instrument was similar (they ob-
tained an isotopic ratio of about 36Ar/38Ar ∼ 5.4 ± 1.4). In
the Solar wind, the isotopic ratio of 40Ar/38Ar/36Ar have been
measured to be 0.00/1.00/5.50 (Meshik et al. 2007), whereas
in the interstellar medium (ISM), 36Ar isotope is found to be
the most abundant (∼ 84.6%) followed by 38Ar (∼ 15.4%)
and traces of 40Ar (∼ 0.025%) (Wieler 2002).
In line to
this fact, Barlow et al. (2013) predicted 36ArH+ with com-
paratively higher abundance than 40ArH+ or 38ArH+. Using
the data from the Spectral and Photometric Image REceiver
(SPIRE) on the Herschel satellite, they reported J = 1→0
(617.5 GHz) and J = 2→1 (1234.6 GHz) emission of 36ArH+
along with the strongest ﬁne structure component of the OH+
ion (971.8 GHz) towards the Crab. They predicted the lim-
its of the abundance ratios to be 36ArH+/38ArH+ > 2 and
36ArH+/40ArH+ > 4 − 5. They also derived the abundance of
argonium ion.

Hydrogen related ions of the noble gas species are very
useful tracers of physical conditions (Hamilton et al. 2016).
The argonium ion can be used as a unique tracer of H2 (by
anti-correlation) as well as atomic gas (correlation) in spe-
ciﬁc environments (Barlow et al. 2013; Schilke et al. 2014).
Moreover, it would also be a good tracer of the almost purely
atomic diﬀuse ISM in the Milky Way (Neufeld & Wolﬁre
36Ar is mainly produced during the core collapse

of supernova events by the explosive nucleosynthesis reac-
tions in massive stars. Excitations of molecules in the Crab
mainly occur due to the collision with electrons in the re-
gion with density of about ∼ 102 cm−3. Schilke et al. (2014)
assigned the J = 1←0 transition of both the isotopologues
of ArH+ (36ArH+ and 38ArH+) in absorption with HIFI on
board of the Herschel satellite towards numerous prominent
continuum sources. For example, they identiﬁed both the iso-
topologues (36ArH+ and 38ArH+) in Sagittarius B2(M) and
only the primary isotopologue (36ArH+) towards Sgr B2(N),
W51e, W49N, W31C, and G34.26+0.15. M¨uller et al. (2015)
also detected 36ArH+ and 38ArH+ in absorption of a fore-
ground galaxy at z = 0.89 along two diﬀerent lines of
sight toward PKS 1830 − 211 with band 7 of the Atacama
Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) interferom-
eter. Hamilton et al. (2016) described excitation of ArH+ in
the Crab by collisions with electrons through radiative trans-
fer calculations and found that the ratio of the 2 → 1 and
1 → 0 emission is consistent with the ArH+ column den-
sity of 1.7 × 1012 cm−2. Priestley et al. (2017) performed

combined photo-ionization and photodissociation modeling
of ArH+ and OH+ emission of the Crab ﬁlament subjected
to the synchrotron radiation and a high ﬂux of charged par-
ticles. Their model was able to successfully reproduce the
observation of Barlow et al. (2013) while they considered to-
tal hydrogen densities between 1900 and 2 × 104 cm−3.

Neon is much more abundant than argon. Though the Her-
schel survey covers the transition J = 1 → 0 of NeH+ at
1039.3 GHz, no NeH+ transition has yet been reported. He-
lium is the second most abundant species (after hydrogen) in
the universe having abundance 1/10 relative to hydrogen nu-
clei. Since argon, neon, helium are the noble gases, they do
not normally form stable molecules, but they can form stable
ions. After a few hundred thousand years of Big Bang, when
the universe cools suﬃciently below 4000 K, helium was the
ﬁrst neutral atom produced in the universe due to its highest
ionization potential, and so it can be neutral at higher tem-
peratures than hydrogen. Shortly after the ﬁrst helium atom
formation, the ﬁrst chemical bond in the universe formed
through the radiative association reaction between the neutral
He atom and a proton. They formed HeH+ with the emission
of a photon. Due to this fact, HeH+ is considered as the ﬁrst
molecular ion formed in the universe and its bond is consid-
ered as the ﬁrst chemical bond of the universe (Lepp et al.
2002; Galli & Palla 2013).

The helium hydride ion, HeH+ was ﬁrst identiﬁed in the
laboratory nearly 100 years ago (Hogness & Lunn 1925), and
its existence was speculated in the ISM ﬁrst in 1970s (Black
1978). Despite these early measurements and predictions,
recently for the ﬁrst time HeH+ has been detected in space.
G¨usten et al. (2019) reported the ﬁrst astrophysical identiﬁ-
cation of HeH+ based on advances in terahertz spectroscopy
and high-altitude observation using the German REceiver for
Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies (GREAT) facility on the
Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).
They identiﬁed HeH+ by its rotational ground-state transition
at a wavelength of 149.137 µm (2010.184 GHz) in the young
and dense planetary nebula, NGC 7027, which is located in
the constellation of Cygnus. Very recently, Neufeld et al.
(2020) identiﬁed the rovibrational transitions (v = 1 - 0 P(1)
at 3.51629 µm and v = 1 - 0 P(2) at 3.60776 µm) of HeH+ in
emission. They observed these transitions toward the same
planetary nebula NGC 7027 using the iSHELL spectrograph
on NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Maunakea
and conﬁrmed the early discovery reported by G¨usten et al.
(2019).

Zicler et al. (2017) considered HeH+

n clusters to compute
the abundances of HeH+, HeH+
3 ions. They did
Potential Energy Surface scan and found HeH+
3 as the most
favorable cluster to study. They also calculated reaction rate
constants for the formation of HeH+
3 ion using two diﬀerent
reaction channels. Priestley et al. (2017) have done chemi-

cal modeling by considering various Ar and He related ions.
They predicted HeH+ emission above detection thresholds.
They also pointed out that the formation time-scale for this
molecule is much longer than the age of the Crab.

Our present manuscript attempts to model the chemistry
of various hydride and hydroxyl cations of argon (ArH+ and
ArOH+), neon (NeH+ and NeOH+), and helium (HeH+ and
HeOH+) along with their various isotopologues (36Ar, 38Ar,
40Ar, 20Ne, and 22Ne) for the condition suitable in the Crab
environment and ﬁnd out a favorable parameter space which
can explain the observational features. In Section 2, we have
discussed the adopted physical conditions. In Section 3, a de-
tail discussion is made regarding the adopted chemical path-
ways and their rates are presented. The chemical modeling
results are discussed in Section 4 and ﬁnally, in Section 5, we
make concluding remarks.

2. PHYSICAL CONDITIONS

Since the physical and chemical processes are interrelated,
it is essential to use suitable physical conditions to constrain
the chemical abundances of the noble gas species considered
in this work. Here, we modeled a single Crab Nebula ﬁla-
ment by using the Cloudy code (version 17.02, last described
by Ferland et al. 2017). Cloudy is a spectral synthesis code
which is designed to simulate matter under a broad range of
interstellar conditions. It is provided for the general use un-
der an open-source, https://www.nublado.org. Here, we have
constructed two models: Model A and Model B to explain
various aspects of the Crab.

Earlier Owen & Barlow (2015) modeled the properties
of dust and gas densities by ﬁtting the predicted spectral
energy distribution (SED) to the multi-wavelength observa-
tions. Based on their results, here, we used amorphous car-
bon grain to mimic the dust pertaining inside the Crab. For
the amorphous carbon grain model, we used the optical con-
stants from Zubko et al. (1996) and adopted a mass density of
1.85 g cm−3. We modiﬁed the default grain size distribution
of Cloudy and assumed that it will maintain a power law dis-
tribution n(a) ∝ a−α with α = 2.7, amin = 0.005 µm, and amax
= 0.5 µm following the clumpy model VI of Owen & Barlow
(2015). We used a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio ( Md
= 0.027;
Mg
Owen & Barlow 2015) suitable for the Crab. In the Cloudy
code, the extinction-to-gas ratio AV /N(H) is self consistently
calculated based on the dust-to-gas mass ratio. We obtained
an extinction-to-gas ratio of AV /N(H) ∼ 2.094 × 10−20 mag
cm2. Priestley et al. (2017) used a similar dust-to-gas mass
ratio in their model but they kept their extinction-to-gas ra-
tio AV /N(H) at the standard interstellar value (6.289 × 10−22
mag cm2) which is about two order of magnitude lower than
the (more realistic) value used here. We assumed that our
object is located 2.5 pc away from the central source (i.e.,
inner radius, rin = 2.5 pc) and the thickness (dr) of our shell

ered rin >> dr, in principle, a plane-parallel geometry can be
assumed. We included the extensive model of H2 molecule
described by Shaw et al. (2005) in our model calculations.
We considered a detailed treatment of the physics of PAHs,
including photoelectric heating and collisional processes.

We adopted a SED shape mentioned in Hester (2008) and
considered the luminosity (L) of the central object 1.3 × 1038

central source, the intensity of the external radiation ﬁeld

is shown in Figure 1a. The Galactic background radiation
ﬁeld proposed by Bertoldi & Draine (1996) is also included
to modify our SED. This radiation ﬁeld is only deﬁned over a
narrow wavelength range. The strength of this radiation ﬁeld
was 31 Draine unit (i.e., 31× the interstellar radiation ﬁeld in
Draine’s units ≈ 31 × 2.7 × 10−3 erg s−1 cm−2, Draine 1978).
Resulting SED with the inclusion of the Galactic background
radiation ﬁeld is shown in Figure 1b. We digitally extracted
(using https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) the output X-ray spec-
trum (i.e., Figure 1) of Priestley et al. (2017) and included an
X-ray ﬂux of 0.35 erg cm−2 s−1 from 0.1 to 100 Å in our
SED (Figure 1c). The shape and intensity of the ﬁnal SED
used in case of the Crab is shown in Figure 1c. All the pa-
rameters discussed here are considered as the input physical
parameters of our Model A.

Richardson et al. (2013) studied the nature of the H2 emit-
ting gas in the Crab knot 51. They mentioned that David-
son’s SED (Davidson & Fesen 1985) is a reasonable ﬁt to re-
produce observations. In Figure 2, we have shown the SED
of Davidson & Fesen (1985) (solid curve) for modelling the
ionizing particle model following Richardson et al. (2013)
(Model B). Additionally, we have considered a SED shown
in Figure 2 for diﬀuse ISM case (dashed curve). Detail about
this SED and modeling results are discussed in Section 4.1.
All the relevant physical properties considered here are
summarized in Table 1 and the gas phase elemental abun-
dances are listed in Table 2. Table 1 and 2 contain in-
put parameters for the two models; Model A and Model
B. In Model A, we have considered the physical parame-
ters from Priestley et al. (2017) and initial elemental abun-
dances from the clumpy model VI of Owen & Barlow
In Model B, we have considered the initial ele-

mental abundances and physical input parameters for the
ionizing particle model which were considered by Richard-
son et al. (2013) to explain the nature of H2 emitting gas
in the Crab Knot 51 ﬁlamentary region. Some major dif-
ferences between the physical parameters of Model A and
Model B is that Model A is a constant density model whereas
in Model B, we have considered a dense core (nH(core) ∼
105.25 cm−3) by introducing a varying density proﬁle and
the grain type in both the models are diﬀerent. The re-
sults obtained with Model B are reported in the Appendix
Section C. For the initial isotopic ratio of argon and neon,
we have used 36Ar/38Ar/40Ar = 84.5946/15.3808/0.0246 and
20Ne/21Ne/22Ne = 92.9431/0.2228/6.8341 respectively, fol-
lowing Wieler (2002).

(7500−15000 K; Davidson & Fesen 1985) for the ionized gas
and measured excitation temperature of the H2 (2000 − 3000
K; Loh et al. 2011) in the Crab region is much higher than
that of these energy levels. If the region where ArH+ tran-
sitions were observed has the density of the colliding part-
ner exceeding the critical density and temperature > 100 K,
the level populations would be in Boltzmann equilibrium and
yield a 2−1/1−0 ratio of ∼ 30. Since the observed ratio is of
∼ 2, it is expected that the density of the colliding partner is
much lower than their critical densities. Barlow et al. (2013)
also attributed this diﬀerence to the density of the collisional
partners below the critical density of ArH+ rotational levels.
They used a radiative transfer model to ﬁnd out the densities
of H2 and e− from the observational ratio. They obtained a
critical density of electrons ∼ 104 cm−3 and H2 ∼ 108 cm−3.
ArH+ favors regions where H2/H is small. If there might
be any signiﬁcant H2 density, then the reactive collision with
ArH+ may be high enough to aﬀect the excitation. By includ-
ing the reactive collision rate with H2, it might be possible to
use the comparison between models and observed ﬂuxes to
place a limit on the H2/H ratio in the emitting region. How-
ever, with the public version of RADEX, it is not possible
to include this feature. Moreover, around the region, where
ArH+ was identiﬁed in the Crab, abundance of H atoms and
electrons is > 104−5 times higher than that of the H2 (see Fig-
ure 16 of Priestley et al. (2017) and Figure 9 and Figure C3 in
the latter part of this manuscript). This suggests that a non-
reactive collision might be the primary source of excitation
of ArH+ in the Crab ﬁlamentary region.

Barlow et al. (2013) used MADEX code (Cernicharo 2012)
where they used H2 and electron as the collision partner.

Due to the unavailability of the collisional rate parameters,
they used the collisional de-excitation rate of SiH+ + He and
CH+ + e− in place of the interaction of H2 and e− with ArH+
respectively. Since the electron-impact rate coeﬃcient for the
dipolar transitions is roughly 104−5 larger than the neutrals (H
and H2), Hamilton et al. (2016) used electron as the only col-
liding partner. Since reactive collisions are not implemented
in the public version of the RADEX, we considered only the
non-reactive collisions into account. We assumed that due
to the low abundance of H2 in the region of ArH+ forma-
tion and high electron-impact rate, reactive collision with H2
will have minimal eﬀect in this condition. Here, we con-
sider 3 colliders; H, H2, and electron in RADEX. Collisional
rates with H and H2 are scaled (Sch¨oier et al. 2005) from
the available collisional rates of ArH+ − He obtained from
Garc´ıa-V´azquez et al. (2019) and collisional rates with elec-
trons are taken from Hamilton et al. (2016).

Here, we used the RADEX code (van der Tak et al. 2007)
for non-LTE computation to explain the observational results.
We prepared this collisional data ﬁle by using the spectro-
scopical parameters available in the JPL (Pickett 1991) or
CDMS (M¨uller et al. 2001, 2005) database and included the
electron impact excitation rates from Hamilton et al. (2016).
Collisional data ﬁles for the other hydride/hydroxyl cations
were mostly unavailable in the Cloudy code as well. We
used our approximated data ﬁles for the calculation of the
surface brightness/emissivity discussed in the later part of
this manuscript. We considered Figure 1c as the input of
the background radiation ﬁeld in the radiative transfer cal-

personal.sron.nl/∼vdtak/radex/index.shtml. This ﬁle contains
three columns. First column is the wavenumber (cm−1), sec-
ond is the intensity (in units of Jy/nsr) and third is the dilution
factor. The dilution factor varies between 0 to 1. Here, for
the estimation, we have used an average dilution factor 0.5.
We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant diﬀerence while considering a
diﬀerent dilution factor in our calculations.

We have drawn a parameter space with a wide range of H
density (1−108 cm−3), H2 density (10−2 −104 cm−3), electron
number density (1 − 106 cm−3), and excitation temperature
(10 − 3000 K). Figure 3 shows the surface brightness ratio
between 2 → 1 and 1 → 0 transitions of 36ArH+. For this
computation, we considered the column density of 36ArH+
∼ 1.7 × 1012 cm−2 as obtained from Hamilton et al. (2016),
and a line width (FWHM) 5 km/s. For the left four pan-
els we considered H2 density 1 cm−3 and temperature ﬁxed
at 10 K, 100 K, 1000 K, and 3000 K respectively. Some
contours near the observed surface brightness ratio (∼ 2) are
highlighted in all the panels. The top left panel of Figure 3
shows that at 10 K, surface brightness ratio between these
two transitions is ∼ 0. This is because the excitation temper-
ature is below the up-state energy of these two transitions.
For the higher temperature, energy levels are gradually pop-
ulated and the ratio increases. The left four panels of Figure
3 depict that the observed ratio is obtained with an electron
density of 1000 − 3000 cm−3 when the number density of
H atoms is < 106−7 cm−3 and the temperature is beyond the
up-state energy of 2 → 1 and 1 → 0. For the case with tem-
perature 100 K, when H density is below ∼ 107 cm−3, the
observed ratio is obtained with an electron density ∼ 1000
cm−3. For nH ∼ 107 cm−3, the observed ratio is obtained with
ne = 1 − 1000 cm−3. As we gradually increase the tempera-
ture, the observed ratio is obtained at lower H density (for
example at 1000 K it is ∼ few times ×106 cm−3) and a little
higher electron density range (1 − 2000 cm−3). If the temper-
ature is further increased from here (i.e., at 3000 K), a very
small decrease of nH and little increase in ne range is required
to reproduce the observed ratio. For the higher temperature
(∼ 3000 K) and higher electron density (> 105), the high-
est value of the ratio ∼ 30 is achieved. This value is also
obtained when the H density is around 108 cm−3. Thus the
critical density of electrons and hydrogen atoms are 105 cm−3
and 108 cm−3 respectively. In the right four panels of Figure
3, we kept the temperature ﬁxed at 2700 K and H2 density
ﬁxed at 10−2 cm−3, 1 cm−3, 102 cm−3 and 104 cm−3 respec-
tively. All the four panels give a similar result which implies
that the excitation is independent of the H2 collision. The
left four panels of Figure 3 remain unchanged when H2 is
omitted as a collider. The right four panels show that it is in-
dependent of the collision of H2 when an H2 density is < 104
cm−3. However, the reactive collisions with H2 may show the
diﬀerences which are not considered here due to the limita-

tion of the public version of the RADEX code. In brief, we
found that it is only the non-reactive collision with electrons
which can successfully explain the excitation of the ArH+
when temperature is beyond the up-state energy of these
two levels discussed here. Loh et al. (2012) estimated the
electron number density and total hydrogen number density
(n(H+) + n(H) + 2n(H2)) in the ﬁlaments and knots around
1400−2500 cm−3 and 14000−25000 cm−3 respectively. Bar-
low et al. (2013) estimated the electron number density of ∼
few times 100 cm−3. Our results shown in the left four panels
of Figure 3 require ne of ∼ 2000 − 3000 cm−3 to reproduce
the observed ratio around the measured excitation tempera-
ture of H2. Only the non-reactive collision with electrons can
explain the ArH+ excitation in the crab.

3. CHEMICAL PATHWAYS
Following the reaction network of ArH+ presented in
Priestley et al. (2017), here, we prepared similar pathways
for the formation and destruction of NeH+ and HeH+. Ad-
ditionally, we prepared the pathways for the formation and
destruction of the hydroxyl cations of these noble gas species
(ArOH+, NeOH+, and HeOH+) under similar environments.
In Table 3, we have listed the reaction network adopted here
to study the chemical evolution of the related hydride and
hydroxyl cations along with the corresponding used rate co-
eﬃcients. Enlisted rate coeﬃcients are either estimated or
taken from the literature as mentioned in the footnote. In the
following subsections, we present an extensive discussion for
the preparation or adaptation of the rate coeﬃcients of vari-
ous kind of reactions considered. We used the reaction rates
of UMIST as the default for the other reactions. For the H2
formation on grains, we have used the modiﬁed “Jura rate”
(Sternberg & Neufeld 1999) for Model A. The default “Jura
rate” of H2 formation is 3×10−17 cm3 s−1 (Jura 1975). In case
of Model B, chemical pathways are the same as discussed
above except the H2 formation rate through grain catalysis.
This rate is taken from Cazaux & Tielens (2002) as it was
considered by Richardson et al. (2013).

3.1. Cosmic-ray ionization rate
The cosmic-ray ionization rate aﬀects the chemical and
ionization state of the gas. The Cloudy code was devel-
oped to deal with various astrophysical environments. This
code actually deals with the cosmic-ray density. It automat-
ically converts the given cosmic-ray ionization rates into the
cosmic-ray density internally. It considers cosmic-ray ion-
ization rate as 2 × 10−16 s−1 per H (ζ(cid:48)
H) and 4.6 × 10−16
s−1 per H2 (ζ(cid:48)
) by default. Thus, the default rate per H2
H2
(ζ(cid:48)
H). The factor
H2
2.3 instead of 2 in the relation arises due to the contribution
of the ionization produced by the secondary ionizations by
supra-thermal electrons knocked oﬀ in the primary ioniza-
tion. Here, we used the cosmic-ray ionization rate per H2 as

) is 2.3 times higher than that of H (ζ(cid:48)

= ζ0 = 1.3×10−17 s−1 (Cloudy code scales it with respect
ζH2
to ζ(cid:48)
H to consider the cosmic-ray density) as our standard rate
and varied the rate (in between ζ0 and 108ζ0) with respect
to it. This means our standard ζH = 5.65 × 10−18 s−1. In
Table 3, reaction number 1 (CR) of Ar chemistry represents
the cosmic-ray ionization rate by ζH and reaction number 2
(CRPHOT) by ζH2. For the similar cosmic-ray ionization re-
actions with He and Ne chemistry, we considered the same
leading coeﬃcient as used for Ar chemistry in Schilke et al.
(2014) and Priestley et al. (2017). In Cloudy, the direct ion-
ization by cosmic-rays is automatically considered for all the
ionization stages and all the elements.

3.2. Ion-neutral reaction rate
Rate coeﬃcients of the ion-neutral (IN) reaction of the
Ar related species were already discussed in Priestley et al.
(2017). In constructing the reaction network with He and Ne,
either we assumed the same rate constants as used for the IN
reactions of Ar or used some educated guess. We also in-
cluded the reaction pathways and rate constants from G¨usten
et al. (2019), Neufeld et al. (2020), and Orient (1977). In
Table 3, the IN rates are given in reaction numbers 3 − 10,
14 − 24 for Ar, 3 − 10, 14 − 25 for Ne, and 3 − 10, 14 for
He chemistry. Reaction numbers 14 − 24 of Ar, 14 − 25 of
Ne chemistry were not considered in Priestley et al. (2017).
However, these pathways are included in the Cloudy default
network and thus we used it.

T

For reaction 3 (Ar + H2

+ → ArH+ + H) of Ar, we con-
sidered a rate coeﬃcient of 10−9 cm3 s−1 following Priest-
ley et al. (2017). We also used quantum-chemical calcu-
lations (DFT B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory) with
the Gaussian 09 suite of program (Frisch et al. 2013) and
found that this reaction is highly exothermic. Similar cal-
+ → NeH+ + H) and
culations for NeH+ formation (Ne + H2
+ → HeH+ + H) show highly en-
HeH+ formation (He + H2
dothermic nature. Neufeld et al. (2020) considered a rate co-
) cm3 s−1 for the HeH+ for-
eﬃcient ∼ 3 × 10−10exp( −6717 K
mation by this reaction. We noticed that the endothermicity
of NeH+ formation by this reaction is smaller than that of the
endothermicity of HeH+. Since no reference was available
+ → NeH+ + H, we scaled the HeH+ formation
for Ne + H2
rate here and used ∼ 2.58 × 10−10exp( −6717 K
) cm3 s−1 in our
network.

In case of reaction 4 (X + H3

+ → XH+ + H2) of Ar, an en-
dothermic value of about 6400 K was used by Priestley et al.
(2017). We used the same empirical relation for the reaction
+ and He/Ne. From our quantum-chemical calcu-
between H3
lations, we obtained an endothermic value of about 6019 K,
27456 K, and 29110 K for reaction 4 of the Ar, Ne, and He
related pathways respectively and used these values for the
computation of the rate constant of reaction 4 shown in Table
3.

nNeufeld et al. (2020) and references therein.

We calculated the reaction enthalpies for the reaction num-
ber 5 − 10 of Table 3 and found all reactions are exothermic.

Rate constants of some of these reactions for Ar were already

10

Das et al.

given in Priestley et al. (2017) and we used the same. For
the estimation of the rate constant for Ne, we derived a scal-
ing factor depending on our computed exothermicity values.
Since the reaction 5a of He chemistry network was not con-
sidered by the earlier studies (G¨usten et al. 2019; Neufeld
et al. 2020), we are not considering this reaction here. We
considered two other routes of the Ne and He chemistry hav-
ing possible product channels: 5(b) X+ + H2 → X + H + H+,
and 5(c) X+ + H2 → X + H+
2 . In the case of X=Ne, the chan-
nel 5(b) is considered because the ionization potential of Ne
(21.56 eV) is greater than the sum of the ionization potential
of H and the dissociation energy of H2, i.e. (13.60 + 4.48)
eV = 18.08 eV. In the UMIST network, we found that similar
reaction channels (5b and 5c) were available for the X=He
chemistry network. By calculating the reaction enthalpies
and comparing it between the reactions 5b and 5c of Ne and
He network, we again obtained scaling factors to estimate
the rate coeﬃcients of reactions 5b and 5c of Ne chemistry
network.

For the rate coeﬃcient for the destruction of ArH+ with H2,
we considered the same one used in Priestley et al. (2017).
For the destruction of HeH+ by H2 (i.e., reaction number 6
of He chemistry), we used the rate coeﬃcient measured by
Orient (1977). For the NeH+ destruction by H2, we used the
similar scaling technique as mentioned earlier. We prepared
the IN reaction network of He according to the very recent
work by Neufeld et al. (2020). For the sake of complete-
ness, they updated the reaction network developed by G¨usten
et al. (2019) and added several formation and destruction re-
actions related to He. We included the HeH+ destruction by
H (reaction 14 of He network) with a constant rate coeﬃcient
1.7 × 10−9 cm3s−1.

3.3. Radiative association

Recently, Theis & Fortenberry (2016) studied the for-
mation of ArOH+ and NeOH+ quantum-chemically. They
considered three channels for the formation of NeOH+ (by
Ne+ + OH, NeO + H+, and NeH+ + O) and three channels
for the formation of ArOH+ (by Ar+ + OH, ArO + H+, and
ArH+ + O). According to their relative energy calculations,
ArOH+ remains in an energy state lower than the total rel-
ative energy of their reactants and products (see Figure 2
of Theis & Fortenberry (2016)), whereas NeOH+ leads to a
likely spontaneous dissociation into Ne and OH+ (see Figure
1 of Theis & Fortenberry (2016)). Since the reactants have
higher energy, some energy is released during its formation.
These reactions could be treated as radiative association re-
actions (reaction numbers 11-13 of Table 3). We calculated
the rate constant of these reactions by using the method de-
scribed below (Bates 1983):

K = 1 × 10−21Ar

(6E0 + N − 2)3N−7
(3N − 7)!

cm3s−1.

(1)

This temperature-independent semi-empirical relation pro-
vided by Bates (1983) requires the association energy (E0)
in eV, numbers of nuclei (N) in the complex, and transition
probability (Ar) in s−1, which is taken as 100, as suggested by
Bates (1983). Calculated rates for reactions 11 − 13 are noted
in Table 3. But this is to be noted that this semi-empirical re-
lation provided by Bates (1983) is temperature-independent
and estimated at ∼ 30 K. Here, we are dealing with Crab
knots where the temperature is much higher. Keeping this in
mind, additionally, we considered an upper limit (10−10 cm3
s−1) of these reactions. Although Theis & Fortenberry (2016)
did not consider the reaction between X (= Ar, Ne, and He)
and OH+ for the formation of XOH+, we considered reaction
number 11 of each network since we found it exothermic.

We adopted a value of 1.44 × 10−16 cm3 s−1 as the rate co-
eﬃcient of the HeH+ formation reaction (He related reaction
number 15 i.e., He+ + H → HeH+ + hν). G¨usten et al. (2019)
neglected He + H+ → HeH+ +hν (reaction 16 of He related
reactions) in the planetary nebula environment which dom-
inates HeH+ formation in the early universe. But Neufeld
et al. (2020) considered the same formation of HeH+ by the
radiative association reaction using a temperature dependent
rate 5.6 × 10−21( T
104K )−1.25 cm3 s−1. Here also, we used the
same rate coeﬃcient for reaction 16 of He network.

3.4. X-ray ionization rate

X-ray photo-ionization including inner-shell

ionization
and Auger cascades, collisional ionization by secondary elec-
trons coming from inner shell photo-ionization are fully
treated in Cloudy for all the basic elements without any spe-
cial action being required. However, the physical conditions
adopted here demand a chemical network which considers
the eﬀect of X-ray ionization into account. We need to con-
sider the three types of X-ray induced reactions namely (a)
ionization by direct X-rays (ζXR), (b) secondary ionization
by X-rays (ζXRPHOT ), and (c) electron impact X-ray ioniza-
tion (ζXRS EC). The X-ray can mainly ionize the heavy ele-
ments by removing the K-shell electron. The vacancy created
by the removal of K-shell electron is then ﬁlled by Auger
transitions. During this process, other electrons and X-ray
photons are emitted by the ion, resulting in multiply ionized
species. X-ray ionization is a very important means to dic-
tate the chemistry around the Crab environment. Here, we
computed various X-ray ionization rate adopting the method
used in Meijerink & Spaans (2005). Though these calculated
rates are directly not used in the Cloudy model, it will be very
useful to build the noble gas related pathways from scratch.
Please see the Appendix Section A of this paper for a detailed
process for the estimation of the X-ray ionization rate.

3.5. Electronic and dissociative recombination

Hydride and hydroxyl cations of Noble gas in the Crab nebula

11

We have considered the Electronic Recombination (ER) re-
actions of all the Noble gas atomic ions (X+, X++ for X =Ar,
Ne, He) and Dissociative Recombination (DR) reactions of
all the Noble gas molecular ions (XH+, XOH+ for X =Ar,
Ne, He). The ER reactions with numbers 29-30 for Ar, 30-31
for Ne, and 21-22 for He are treated automatically in Cloudy
to make sure that they correctly balance the inverse photo-
ionization processes, so we did not include it again. We en-
listed it in Table 3 for the sake of completeness. Priestley
et al. (2017) considered a temperature dependent rate coeﬃ-
cient for ER of Ar+ (Schilke et al. 2014) and Ar++ (Shull &
van Steenberg 1982).

For the DR of ArH+, Priestley et al. (2017) considered
a typical rate of about 10−9 cm3 s−1 for their initial model
following Schilke et al. (2014) and a reduced rate of 10−11
cm3 s−1 for their ﬁnal models. Abdoulanziz et al. (2018)
have presented the cross-sections for dissociative recombina-
tion (DR) and electron-impact vibrational excitation of ArH+
at electron energies appropriate for the interstellar environ-
ment and found very low values of the DR rate coeﬃcients
at temperatures below 1000 K, which leads to the conclusion
that the collisions with H2 molecules and the photodissoci-
ation are the only signiﬁcant ArH+ destruction mechanisms
in the ISM. Here, we considered a temperature-independent
rate constant of 10−11 cm3 s−1, similar to the ﬁnal mod-
els of Priestley et al. (2017) for the DR of ArH+.
In ad-
dition, we assumed the same rate constant 10−11 is valid
for the DR of ArOH+, NeH+, and NeOH+. For HeH+, we
used the very recently updated temperature dependent rate
of 4.3 × 10−10(T/104 K)−0.5 cm3 s−1 following Neufeld et al.
(2020). For HeOH+, we considered the same DR rate as it
was considered for HeH+.

3.6. Photodissociation

We have considered the Photodissociation (PH) reactions
of the hydride and hydroxyl cations. Rate coeﬃcients of
these reactions (except PH reaction of HeH+; i.e., He chem-
istry reaction number 25) were considered to be the same as
it was considered for the PH reaction of ArH+ (Priestley et al.
2017; Roueﬀ et al. 2014). Priestley et al. (2017) did not con-
sider the PH reaction of HeH+ because their input SED has
negligible ﬂux beyond the Lyman limit relevant for the cross-
section given by Roberge & Dalgarno (1982). G¨usten et al.
(2019) also neglected as the reaction progresses very slowly.
We consider PH reaction of HeH+ according to Neufeld et al.
(2020) which is automatically controlled in Cloudy default
network.

Note— For the initial isotopic ratio of argon and neon, we
have used 36Ar/38Ar/40Ar = 84.5946/15.3808/0.0246
and 20Ne/21Ne/22Ne = 92.9431/0.2228/6.8341 respec-
tively, following Wieler (2002).

Based on this network, we studied the chemical evolution of
the hydride and hydroxyl cations of Ar, Ne, and He. Schilke
et al. (2014) assigned absorption lines of ArH+ to the previ-
ously unidentiﬁed absorption lines. Though we mainly focus
here on the Crab environment, it will be very useful to ﬁrst
check our model with the model described in Schilke et al.
(2014) and Priestley et al. (2017) for the diﬀuse ISM. It will
be also useful to look at the predicted abundances of other
hydride and hydroxyl cations in diﬀuse cloud conditions as
well.

4.1. Diﬀuse Interstellar Medium

Here, we assumed the cloud with initial number density of
total hydrogen nuclei (nH) as 50 cm−3 and a primary cosmic-
ray ionization rate for atomic hydrogen as ζH = 2 × 10−16 s−1
(Schilke et al. 2014). We considered the default ISM elemen-
tal abundances of Cloudy which are shown in Table 4. The
unextinguished local interstellar radiation ﬁeld is generated
with the keyword Table ISM in Cloudy. We used the mean In-
terstellar Radiation Field (ISRF) (Draine 1978) of 1 Draine
unit and the resultant shape of the incident SED is further
modiﬁed by including the extinction due to photoelectric ab-
sorption by a cold neutral slab with column density of N(H)
= 1020 cm−2 (Figure 2). Using the default ISM grain, the
H2 grain formation rate of 3 × 10−17 cm3s−1 (Jura 1975) and
by considering the default PAH treatment in Cloudy, we ob-
tained an extinction-to-gas ratio as AV /N(H) = 5.412 × 10−22
mag cm2 for this region.

Figure 4 shows the abundances of some of the important
species considered in our network as a function of the visual
extinction, AV . Throughout the region, the cloud remains in
atomic form and the H2 fractional abundance varies in be-
tween 2 × 10−5 and 10−1. The electron temperature varies
in the range 25 − 50 K and electron fractional abundance re-

species. NeH+ also follows the similar behavior of ArH+
and a strong anti-correlation with H2 is observed. We obtain
a peak fractional abundance of NeH+ ∼ 5 × 10−8. Table 4
shows a higher initial elemental abundance of Ne than that
= 43.6). This is also reﬂected in the obtained peak
of Ar ( Ne
Ar
abundance ratio between NeH+ and ArH+ (∼ 38). However,
the much higher initial elemental abundance of He than that
of the Ar and Ne is not reﬂected in the obtained abundance of
HeH+. The obtained HeH+ fractional abundance is smaller
(peak abundance 5 × 10−11) than ArH+ and NeH+. This is
because ArH+ and NeH+ formation by X+ + H2 → XH+ + H
(reactions number 5 of Ar and 5a of Ne chemistry network)
is considered which is avoided in the case of HeH+ formation
here.

Theis et al. (2015) questioned the formation of NeH+ by
reaction 5a. They also found that the possible product of
+
+ (Ne+ + H2 → Ne + H2
this reaction would be Ne and H2
i.e., reaction 5(c) of the Ne chemistry network). Here for
the diﬀuse cloud model, we found that the major amount of
NeH+ is forming by the reaction between Ne+ and H2 (re-
action 5a) and the abundance of NeH+ is higher than that
of the ArH+. But NeH+ is yet to be identiﬁed in the dif-
fuse region. This also suggests an overestimation of NeH+
abundance in our model. In order to check the eﬀect of re-
action 5a, we have considered a case by switching oﬀ this
reaction (unless otherwise stated, this reaction is on by de-
fault in all the cases reported in this manuscript). In this case,
we found that the abundance of NeH+ signiﬁcantly dropped
and consistent with its absence in the observed spectra (hav-
ing a peak fractional abundance of ∼ 3 × 10−11). Major
formation of NeH+ in this case happens by the reaction 14
(HeH+ + Ne → NeH+ + He) of Ne chemistry network. How-
ever, in this case, also, we have seen the anti-correlation be-
tween NeH+ and H2.

According to the recent work by Theis & Fortenberry
(2016), the hydroxyl cations of noble gas are the most stable
small noble gas molecules analyzed, besides their respective
hydride diatomic cation cousins. So, we included them in
our network and plotted them here to show the comparison
between them. When reaction 5a of Ne chemistry network
is on, abundance proﬁle of ArOH+ and NeOH+ follows the
ArH+ and NeH+ abundance proﬁle because of their major
formation by ArH+ + O and NeH+ + O (reaction 13 of Ar
and Ne chemistry network) respectively. The abundance pro-
ﬁle of HeOH+ follows the abundance proﬁle of OH due to the
major formation of HeOH+ by He+ and OH. When reaction
5a of Ne chemistry network is oﬀ, we found a similar abun-
dance proﬁle of NeOH+ with HeOH+. Figure 4 also shows
the abundances of ArOH+, NeOH+, and HeOH+ by consid-
ering the upper limit of their formation rate by radiative as-
sociation reactions (∼ 10−10 cm3 s−1 see Section 3.3 for the
justiﬁcation). A noticeable production of hydroxyl ions were

Figure 4. Variation of abundances for simple species with diﬀuse

variation of isotopic abundances for noble gas species is shown. The
abundances of 36ArOH+, 20NeOH+, and HeOH+ by considering the
upper limit of their formation rate by radiative association reactions
(∼ 10−10 cm3 s−1) are noted [XOH+ (10−10)]. The abundance pro-
ﬁles of 20NeH+ and 20NeOH+ are also shown when reaction 5a of

mains roughly invariant at ∼ 10−3. Peak abundance of ArH+
is around 1.3 × 10−9, decreasing with increasing AV deep in-
side the ﬁlament. ArH+ is a unique tracer of the atomic gas,
having H2 fractional abundance of 10−4 − 10−3 (Schilke et al.
2014). We ﬁnd a very similar result here. Deep inside the ﬁl-
ament, where the H2 density is suﬃciently increased, a strong
anti-correlation is present between ArH+ and H2. The abun-
dance proﬁle of ArH+ shows a strong anti-correlation with
OH+ and H2O+. It implies that while ArH+ traces the region
with lower H2/H region, OH+ and H2O+ favours the higher
H2/H region. The obtained abundances of Ar+ and ArH+
match those measured by Schilke et al. (2014) and present
a similar variation with AV . For similar conditions, Priest-
ley et al. (2017) found a slightly lower abundance of these

because in the CDMS/JPL database corresponding spec-
tral information was absent. For the initial isotopic ra-
tio of argon and neon, we have used 36Ar/38Ar/40Ar =
84.5946/15.3808/0.0246 and 20Ne/22Ne = 13.6 respectively
(Wieler 2002). We found that the peak fractional abundance
of 38ArH+, 40ArH+, and 22NeH+ is 2.2×10−10, 3.8×10−13 and
4.5 × 109 respectively. This yields a ratio of the peak abun-
dance of 36ArH+/38ArH+/40ArH+ = 84.5946/14.32/0.0247
and 20NeH+/22NeH+ = 11.11/1.0 (reaction 5a of Ne chem-
istry network is considered here). Since no fractionation re-
actions were considered in this work, initial elemental abun-
dances were roughly reﬂected in the abundances of their re-
spective hydride ions.

4.2. The Crab Nebula Filament

Physical conditions suitable for the Crab environment are
already presented in Section 2. Figure 5 shows the variation
of the abundances of diﬀerent ionization states of the primary
isotope of the noble gas ions (X = 36Ar, 20Ne, and He) as a
function of the visual extinction (AV ) for Model A. For this
case, we considered the initial model of the Crab with to-
tal hydrogen nuclei density nH = 1900 cm−3 and cosmic-ray
ionization rate per H2 ζ = ζ0 = 1.3 × 10−17 s−1. This ζ value
is too low for a supernova remnant, more realistic values will
be explored in following sections. Here, we used this value
because it is the standard value used in chemical models of
molecular clouds and used in the initial model of Priestley
et al. (2017). In the three blocks of Figure 5, we have shown
three noble gas Ar, Ne, and He related species. We ﬁnd that

the reaction number 1 − 2 of all the reaction sets of Table
3 and reaction number 27 − 28 of Ar, 28 − 29 of Ne, and
19 − 20 of He are responsible for producing X+ from X. X+
further converts into X++ by the direct X-ray ionization. X++
further can be produced directly from X by the direct X-ray
ionization. In all the blocks of Figure 5, we obtain higher
abundance of X+ compared to X++. Here, we use the ini-
tial elemental abundance of 36Ar, 20Ne and He as 1.0 × 10−5,
4.9 × 10−3 and 1.85, respectively, with respect to total hydro-
gen nuclei in all forms (see Table 2). This initial elemental
abundance ratio between the noble gases is not maintained
after they have formed their respective hydride ions. If they
were following their initial abundances, then the abundance
of the ArH+ would have been of ∼ 105 times lower than that
of the HeH+ ion.
Instead, from Figure 5, we obtain peak
abundance of ArH+, NeH+ (when Ne reaction 5a is oﬀ) and
HeH+ in a similar range. The reason behind this is due to
(i) the lower ionization potential of 36Ar (15.76 eV) com-
pared to 20Ne (21.5645 eV) and He (24.5874 eV), (ii) high
proton aﬃnity of Ar (3.85 eV) compared to Ne (2.08 eV)
and He (1.85 eV) (Jolly 1984) and (iii) the reaction pathways
adopted.

In the early universe, HeH+ formation was dominated by
the reaction between He and H+. Due to their high ioniza-
tion potential, helium ions (He+ and He+2) recombined with
electrons to produce the neutral helium ﬁrst. Neutral helium
was indeed the ﬁrst neutral atom of the universe.
In such
metal-free situation, He then reacted with H+ to form the
ﬁrst chemical bond of the universe (He + H+ → HeH+ + hν)
and thus the ﬁrst molecule, HeH+. Recently, G¨usten et al.
(2019) identiﬁed the pure rotational (J = 1 − 0) transi-
tion of HeH+ in the planetary nebula NGC 7027. But
the formation of HeH+ in the planetary environment pro-
gresses in a very diﬀerent manner. Looking at the en-
vironment of NGC 7027 and its age, they neglected the
HeH+ formation by He + H+
2 → HeH+ + H as well as with
He + H+ → HeH+ + hν (reaction number 3 and 16 respec-
tively of the He network of Table 3). Neufeld et al. (2020)
considered reaction 3 and 16 of He chemistry in their net-
work. Here, we used their adopted rate in our simulation.
Additionally, we also considered He+ + H → HeH+ + hν (re-
action number 15) following G¨usten et al. (2019). The re-
+ (reaction 4) was considered by
action between Ar and H3
Priestley et al. (2017) in their model. We examined XH+
formation by this reaction quantum-chemically (discussed in
Section 3.2). We found an endothermicity value ≈ 6019 K for
the formation of ArH+ by reaction 4 and for the formation of
HeH+ and NeH+, the obtained endothermicity value is ∼ 5
times higher than that of the ArH+. It depicts that the forma-
tion of HeH+ and NeH+ by reaction 4 is only possible at high
temperature (> 1000 K). The consideration of very diﬀer-
ent chemical pathways for the formation of ArH+ compared

to the HeH+ and NeH+ thus played a signiﬁcant role for the
mismatch between the initial elemental ratio considered and
the ratio obtained after the formation of their hydride ions.

The obtained abundance proﬁle and value of 36ArH+
(shown in Figure 5) is similar to that in Figure 3 of Priest-
ley et al. (2017). The lower limit of the detected OH+ tran-
sition in the Crab can be used to set the lower observational
limit for the noble gas-ions modeled here. To show the com-
parison between the OH+ abundance and other noble gas-
related species, we have shown the abundance of OH+ in all
the panels of Figure 5. We obtained a lower peak abundance
of OH+ than Priestley et al. (2017). This is indeed required
because Barlow et al. (2013) observed the ArH+ transition
to be signiﬁcantly stronger than that of the OH+. Figure 5
shows that ArH+ is always more abundant than OH+ and it is
equal around AV = 1 mag.

By considering the same physical condition considered in
case of Figure 5, abundance variation for some of the im-
portant species are shown in Figure 6. The left panel shows
the abundance variation of H, H2, C, C+, CO, OH, and OH+
and the right panel shows simple ions of H (H+, H2
+, and
+), electrons, and the variation of electron temperature.
H3
The left panel shows that most of the hydrogen is in atomic
form and thus the cloud remains entirely atomic. In the outer
part (AV < 1 mag) of the cloud, carbon remains in ion-
ized form (C+), but it converts into the neutral form inside
(AV > 1 mag) the cloud. Since the cloud is mostly in dif-
fuse atomic form, the CO fractional abundance is ∼ 10−10.
Figure 6 shows that the abundance of H2 is increasing deep
inside the cloud and Figure 5 shows that the abundance of
ArH+ is also increasing towards deep inside the cloud. Thus
the anti-correlation which has been seen between the abun-
dance proﬁle of ArH+ and H2 in Figure 4 is not reﬂected here.
This might be due to the consideration of completely dif-
ferent physical-chemical condition between these two cases.
The right panel shows that H+ is very abundant and elec-
tron abundance varies within few times 10−1 (i.e., electron
number density ∼ few times 102 cm−3 for nH = 1900 cm−3),
which matches with that of the predicted electron number
density in the knot of the Crab (Barlow et al. 2013). In this
eﬀort, it is thus essential to ﬁnd out the physical conditions
which can possibly explain most of the observational results
of Barlow et al. (2013).

cm−2, and HeOH+ = 4.34 × 105 cm−2.

4.2.1. Comparison with observations: Model A

To ﬁnd out a suitable favourable zone in explaining the ob-
served features, we varied the physical parameters (nH and
ζ). Our parameter space consists of a density (nH) variation
of about 103 − 107 cm−3 and ζ/ζ0 (ζ0 = 1.3 × 10−17 s−1) vari-
ation of about 1 − 108. Figure 7 shows the absolute surface
brightness variation of various transitions with a wide range
of parameter space for Model A. In Table 6, we have summa-
rized the observed surface brightness of the two transitions of
ArH+ (2 → 1 and 1 → 0), 308 µm (971 GHz, J = 2 → 1, F
= 5/2 → 3/2 ) transition of OH+, and 2.12 µm transition of
H2 (Barlow et al. 2013; Loh et al. 2011). We obtain a reason-
able match of the absolute surface brightness of these transi-
tions with the observation when a high value of ζ
∼ 106−108
ζ0
and nH ∼ 104 − 105.3 cm−3 were considered. In the Appendix
(Figure C1 in Section C) , we show the variation of abso-
lute surface brightness of these transitions with respect to the
variation of a wide range of parameter space (varying ζ
and
ζ0
the core density nH(core)) by considering Model B. Moreover,
in Table 6, we have listed the results obtained from Model
B in explaining the observed absolute surface brightness of
these transitions.

Figure 8 shows the surface brightness ratio of several tran-
sitions for a wide range of parameter space for Model A. Ob-
servational results for this surface brightness ratio are sum-

marized in Table 7. The observed ratio of ∼ 1 − 17 (obtained
by taking the minimum and maximum values from the ob-
served two transitions of ArH+) between the two transitions
of ArH+, and the ratio between these two ArH+ transitions
with respect to OH+ 971 GHz transition were best repro-
duced when we considered ζ
∼ 107 with nH = 104−6 cm−3.
ζ0
Since the transitions of CO were not detected, it is expected
that the surface brightness ratio of the various transitions of
CO with respect to the OH+ 971 GHz transition would be
< 1. We also have obtained a lower surface brightness ratio
between all the transitions of CO and the 971 GHz transi-
tion of OH+. One of the major drawbacks of our Model A is
that we are unable to reproduce the lack of [C i] emissions as
found by Barlow et al. (2013). This mismatch is due to the
high abundance of neutral carbon [C i] in comparison to OH+
in our Model A. However, our model can successfully ex-
plain the lack of CO emission, 158 µm transition of C+ [C ii]
and relative line strengths between [O i] and [C ii]. Similarly,
the results obtained with Model B are shown in Figure C2 of
Appendix Section C and the best suitable zone is highlighted
in Table 7. With Model B, we are able to successfully explain
most of the observed features. Even the lack of [C i] emission
is also well explained by this model.

From Figures 7-8 and Tables 6-7, it is very diﬃcult to ar-
rive at the best suitable parameter for nH and ζ
which can
ζ0
reproduce all the observational results simultaneously. How-

ever, from Model A, we have two favorable matching zones
at nH ∼ 104−5 cm−3 and ζ
∼ 106−7 and for Model B, we
ζ0
found that the value used by Richardson et al. (2013) for their
ionizing particle model nH(core) ∼ 105−6 cm−3 and ζ
∼ 106−7)
ζ0
is favourable. So, in general, in terms of the absolute intrin-
sic surface brightness and surface brightness ratio, we ﬁnd
our favorable parameter space with nH ∼ 104−6 and higher
ζ
ζ0

= 106−7.
In between the favourable zone of Model A, we further
consider nH = 2.00 × 104 cm−3 and ζ = 9.07 × 106ζ0 as
Model A1 to suitably match the absolute surface brightness
of the two transitions of 36ArH+ (242 and 485 µm) and 308
µm transition of OH+ simultaneously and nH = 3.16 × 104
cm−3 and ζ = 4.55 × 106ζ0 as Model A2 to suitably match
the absolute surface brightness of H2 2.12 µm separately. Un-
less otherwise stated, the Model A1 is always used in all the
cases reported throughout this manuscript. Figure 9 shows
the abundance variation of the simple species, along with the
density of electrons and electron temperature of the Crab. It
is clear from the ﬁgure that the temperature of the Crab re-
gion is 4000 K and electron abundance is > 0.1, which is in
line with the observation of Barlow et al. (2013). A suitably
high fractional abundance of H2 (∼ 10−6) is observed which
is capable of explaining the H2 surface brightness in the knots
of the Crab. Additionally, we show the abundances of H+
2 and
H+
3 . In Figure 10a, the abundances of Ar related species along
with their isotopologues are shown, whereas in Figure 10b,
the abundances of He and Ne (and its isotopologues) related
species are shown. We did not consider any fractionation
reaction between the isotopologues of Ar and Ne. Due to
this reason, the elemental abundance ratio is reﬂected in the
molecular abundances of various isotopologues. OH+ had
been identiﬁed in the emitting knots of the Crab. So, the
observability of the species may be compared with respect
to the OH+ abundance. Both the panels of Figure 10 show
the OH+ abundance to understand the fate of other chem-
ical species for the future identiﬁcation in the Crab emit-
ting knots. Figure 10ab clearly depicts that the abundance
of 36ArH+, 20NeH+ (even in the absence of reaction 5a, we
obtained a comparable abundance of 20NeH+ with OH+; see
Figure 10b), and HeH+ are higher than that of the OH+ and
thus 20NeH+ and HeH+ could have been observed in the Crab
emitting knots. However, even with the upper limit of the
rate coeﬃcient, we always obtained a lower abundance of
hydroxyl ions (36ArOH+, 20NeOH+, and HeOH+) compared
to OH+.

Similarly, the abundance proﬁles obtained with Model B
are shown in the Appendix Section C (see Figures C3 and
C4). It is interesting to note that for this case, we have ob-
tained much higher electron temperature (> 10000 K) which
can yield a better estimation for the various atomic transitions
listed in Table 8.

The emissivity of some of the prominent transitions which
are falling in between the frequency regime of Herschel’s
SPIRE and Photodetecting Array Camera and Spectrometer
(PACS), and SOFIA are shown in Figure 11 for Model A1.
Barlow et al. (2013) found that the 2 − 1 and 1 − 0 transitions
of 36ArH+ were signiﬁcantly stronger than that of the OH+.
From Figure 11, we ﬁnd that in most of the region, the 971
GHz (308 µm) transition of OH+ (strongest transition of OH+
in such a condition) is stronger than that of the 1−0 transition
(617 GHz/485 µm) and weaker than the 2−1 transition (1234
GHz/242 µm) of ArH+. This is partly consistent with the ob-
servation of Barlow et al. (2013). Barlow et al. (2013) also
found the J = 2 − 1 transition (1234 GHz/242 µm) stronger
than the J = 1−0 (617 GHz/485 µm). We ﬁnd the same trend
in Figure 11. Barlow et al. (2013) detected only the 971 GHz
(308 µm) transition, which was comparable to the J = 1 − 0
(617 GHz/485 µm) transition of 36ArH+. From our model,
we can see that the 1 − 0 transition of 36ArH+ is comparable
to the 971 GHz transition of OH+ deep inside the ﬁlament.
The emissivity of the XOH+ (X = Ar, Ne, and He) transitions
which are falling in between the 29 − 1409 GHz region are
shown in Figure 12. These transitions could be very useful
for the future astronomical detection of these species around
similar environments, where strong OH+ emission had al-
ready been identiﬁed.

In Table 9, we have listed the strongest transitions which
are falling in the observed range of Herschel’s SPIRE and
PACS spectrometer and also within the range of SOFIA,
ALMA, Very Large Array (VLA), Institute for Radio As-
tronomy in the Millimeter Range (IRAM) 30m, and Northern
Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Optical depth of all
these transitions are also noted. For this calculation, we used
the RADEX program by considering only electrons as col-
liding partners. We consider ne = 103 cm−3 and temperature
2700 K. The radiation ﬁeld shown in Figure 1c is consid-
ered as the background radiation ﬁeld. Total column den-
sity of the species are also noted from the calculation with
nH = 2.00 × 104 cm−3 and ζ/ζ0 = 9.07 × 106 (Model A1).
Similarly, the emissivity obtained with Model B is shown in
Figure C5 and C6.

Barlow et al. (2013) obtained a surface brightness of ∼
(2.2 − 9.9) × 10−7 erg/cm2/s/sr for the 1 → 0 transition of
36ArH+ (617 GHz/485 µm) whereas our best-ﬁtted Model A
(i.e., Model A1) ﬁnds ∼ 2.84×10−7 erg/cm2/s/sr. For the 2 →
1 transition of 36ArH+, Barlow et al. (2013) obtained a sur-
face brightness of ∼ (1.0 − 3.8) × 10−6 erg/cm2/s/sr, whereas
our best-ﬁtted model ﬁnds ∼ 1.29 × 10−6 erg/cm2/s/sr. Priest-
ley et al. (2017) checked the detectability of these transi-
tions based on the observed surface brightness of the 971
GHz (308 µm) transition of OH+. Barlow et al. (2013) ob-
tained the surface brightness of the 971 GHz transition of
∼ (3.4 − 10.3) × 10−7 erg/cm2/s/sr whereas our best-ﬁtted

26

Das et al.

model ﬁnds it ∼ 6.17×10−7 erg/cm2/s/sr. Thus, our best-ﬁtted
model (Model A1) always predicts a comparable or stronger
surface brightness of 36ArH+ transitions (242 and 485 µm) in
comparison to the 308 µm transition of OH+ which is con-
sistent with the results. Now to examine the detectability of
the other transitions of 36ArH+ and for other hydride ions
along with their isotopic forms considered in this study, we
check three criteria for each transition: (i) whether the sur-
face brightness of that transition is comparable or stronger
to the observed surface brightness of the 308 µm transition
of OH+, (ii) the presence of atmospheric transmission (cal-
culated by the ATRAN program of Lord 1992) at the height
of ∼ 41000 ft (i.e., at the height of SOFIA), and (iii) opti-
cal depth of that transition. With the ground-based telescope,
transitions falling in between 30−650 µm are heavily aﬀected
by the atmospheric transmission. For example at the ALMA
site, the amount of precipitable water vapor is typically 1.0
mm that falls below 0.25 mm up to 5% of the time. All the
transitions of 36ArH+ reported in this paper are falling in this
range (69-486 µm) and thus it is diﬃcult to observe these
transitions with any ground-based telescope. However, with
a space-based telescope, it is possible to detect some more
transitions of this species.

To clearly show the detectability of these transitions, in
Figure 13a, we show the surface brightness of these transi-
tions obtained from our best-ﬁtted Model A1 along with the
observed 308 µm transition of OH+. Table 9 clearly shows
that all these transitions have optical depth < 1. Figure 13a
shows that the ﬁrst ﬁve transitions are stronger relative to
the observed 917 GHz (308 µm) transition of OH+. Among
them, 617 GHz (485 µm) and 1234 GHz (242 µm) transitions
were already observed by Herschel which is not operational
any longer. Among the other three transitions of 36ArH+, we
can see that the 2465 GHz (121 µm) and 3078 GHz (97 µm)
are heavily aﬀected by the atmospheric transmission and thus
diﬃcult to observe. But the 3 → 2 transition at 1850 GHz
(162 µm) is away from atmospheric absorption features and
falls in the range of the LFA receiver of the modular het-
erodyne instrument GREAT of SOFIA. However, with the
SOFIA instrument time estimator, we found a long integra-
tion time required for this transition. We expect that with
Herschel the chance of detection would have been higher.

A similar analysis was carried out for 20NeH+ and HeH+.
When we considered Ne+ + H2 → NeH+ + H (reaction 5a)
for the formation NeH+, we obtained a higher abundance of
20NeH+ and called it an upper limit. In the absence of this
reaction, we obtained a lower limit of NeH+ formation. With
the upper limit of its formation, Table 9 shows that 1039 GHz
(288 µm), 2076 GHz (144 µm), and 3110 GHz (96 µm) tran-
sitions have an optical depth > 1. For the other four transi-
tions, it is < 1. Figure 13b shows that the other four tran-
sitions at 4137 GHz (72 µm), 5157 GHz (58 µm), 6167 (48

µm), and 7166 GHz (42 µm) are showing a comparatively
stronger surface brightness than that of the observed 308 µm
transition of OH+. With the lower limit of its formation, Ta-
ble 9 shows that the 7166 GHz (42 µm) transition is below
and the 6167 GHz (48 µm) transition is comparable to the
observed 308 µm transition of OH+. However, the optical
depths of the 2076 GHz and 3110 GHz transitions are found
to be < 1 with the lower limit. But the 2076 GHz transi-
tion is very much aﬀected by the atmospheric transmission
as shown in Figure 13b, which questions its detectability.

In the case of HeH+, we found that the optical depths of all
the transitions are < 1. But, Figure 13c shows that only three
transitions are showing stronger surface brightness compared
to the 308 µm transition of OH+. Among them, the 2010
GHz (149 µm) transition is heavily aﬀected by atmospheric
transmission. The other two transitions at 4008 GHz (75 µm)
and 5984 GHz (50 µm) are free from atmospheric features
and produce a strong surface brightness. Table 9 depicts that
even with the upper limit of the formation, the surface bright-
ness of all the transitions of XOH+ (X = 36Ar, 20Ne, and He)
is less than the surface brightness of the 308 µm transition of
OH+, so their chance of detection in the Crab environment is
very diﬃcult and thus we did not carry out any similar anal-
ysis for them.

4.2.2. Comparison with observations: Model B

In Table 8, we have compared our obtained values with
the observational (Loh et al. 2011, 2012; Gomez et al. 2012;
Richardson et al. 2013; Priestley et al. 2017) as well as
with the previous modeling results (Richardson et al. 2013).
Though in Model B we have used similar parameters as it
was used in Richardson et al. (2013), we obtained a very lit-
tle diﬀerence. This small diﬀerence is due to the changes
in the associative detachment reactions between the Cloudy
version 10.00 (Ferland et al. 1998) (used in Richardson et al.
2013) and version 17.02 (used in this work). In case of Model
A, we did not obtain any transition of Sulfur (S) and Iron
(Fe) because for this case, we did not consider any initial el-
emental abundance for these two elements (see Table 2). For
Model A, we have considered nH = 2.00 × 104 cm−3 and
ζ/ζ0 = 9.07 × 106 (Model A1) and nH = 3.16 × 104 cm−3 and
ζ/ζ0 = 4.55×106 (Model A2), whereas for Model B, we have
considered the ionizing particle model of Richardson et al.
(2013), which yields a core density nH(core) = 105.25 cm−3
and ζ
= 7.06 × 106. The striking diﬀerences between Model
ζ0
A and Model B is the consideration of very high abundance
of He and a dust to gas ratio of 0.027 in Model A, whereas
in Model B, by considering the initial elemental abundance
pointed out in Table 2, we obtained (from the Cloudy output)
a dust-to-gas mass ratio ∼ 8 times lower than that of Model
A. In Table 10, we have provided H2 vibrational lines surface
brightness relative to the 1-0 S(1) line for Knot 51 for both of

Hydride and hydroxyl cations of Noble gas in the Crab nebula

27

our Model A and Model B and compared with the observed
values (Loh et al. 2012). We found that our Model A1 is able
to reproduce the observed line strength ratio except the 2-1
S(X) (X = 1, 2, 3) lines, whereas our Model A2 and Model B
are eﬃcient enough to reproduce the 2-1 S(X) lines. All the
results obtained with Model B are shown in the Appendix
Section C (see Figures C1-C6).

4.3. Time scales of molecule formation

Richardson et al. (2013) and Priestley et al. (2017) men-
tioned that the steady-state chemistry might not be applica-
ble because of the H2 formation time scale and mass-loss rate
of the Crab knot. Richardson et al. (2013) used cloudy ver-
sion 10 for their study and Priestley et al. (2017) used UCL
PDR code (Bell et al. 2005, 2006; Bayet et al. 2011) for their
study. Here, we used Cloudy version 17.02. Presently, to
check whether the computation is time steady or not, we ran
our model with the ‘age’ command available in the Cloudy
code. This command checks whether the micro-physics is
time steady or not. We found that both of our best-ﬁtted mod-
els show that the longest time scale is below the age of the
Cloud (for the best-ﬁtted case of Model A, it is ∼ 9 years and
for Model B it is ∼ 134 years). Thus, we are not overestimat-
ing the abundance of H2 by considering the radiative attach-
ment of H and then associative detachment reaction. Since a
time-dependent simulation is out of scope for this paper, we
discuss here the time scale of their formation relevant to the
environment of the Crab.

4.3.1. ArH+
ArH+ is mainly formed by the reaction between Ar+ and
H2 (Priestley et al. (2017) also reported similar observation)
with a rate coeﬃcient ∼ 10−9 cm3 s−1. This yields a time
∼ 109 sec ∼ 30 years (suﬃciently smaller than the age of
the Crab) by considering H2 density ∼ 1 cm−3. Our best-
ﬁtted zone is also within the limit of the observed surface
brightness of H2. In the observed region, we have H2 number
density < 1 cm−3. This rules out the overestimation of the
formation of ArH+ considered here. Our obtained intrinsic
absolute line surface brightness and line surface brightness
ratio match the observations.

4.3.2. NeH+
In the case of NeH+ formation, if we include the reaction
between Ne+ and H2 (Ne chemistry reaction 5a, see Table 3)
in our network, that is controlling the formation. By consid-
ering an H2 number density ∼ 1 cm−3, the formation time
scale is well within the age of the Crab as discussed in the
context of ArH+. However, in the absence of this pathway,
we found that its formation depends on the HeH+ + Ne route
(Ne chemistry reaction 14). The rate coeﬃcient for the reac-
tion is ∼ 10−9 cm3 s−1. Since the number density of Ne is ∼ 1

cm−3, it is very fast. However, its formation depends on the
HeH+ which is produced by a comparatively slower process
than ArH+.

4.3.3. HeH+

In the best-ﬁtted model, the dominant pathway for the for-
mation of HeH+ is the reaction between He+ and H. Priestley
et al. (2017) also found this pathway as the dominant one in
their network. The rate coeﬃcient used for this reaction is
∼ 1.44 × 10−16 cm3 s−1 (G¨usten et al. (2019) found the best
ﬁt with a rate constant ∼ 6 × 10−16 cm3 s−1). By considering
the H density ∼ 103 − 105 cm−3 used here, the time scale
for the formation of HeH+ seems to be much slower (∼ 103
years by considering the lowest He+ abundance) than that of
the ArH+. However, it is possible to form HeH+ within the
lifetime of the Crab. Recent observation of HeH+ in NGC
7027 (age of ∼ 600 years) by G¨usten et al. (2019) might be a
strong reason to look for HeH+ in the Crab.

Looking at the formation time scales of the hydride ions, it
is quite possible that all these molecules will be likely spotted
in the ﬁlamentary region of the Crab.

4.3.4. ArOH+, NeOH+, and HeOH+

These three noble gas hydroxyl cations are mainly formed
in our network by the radiative association reactions (see Sec-
tion 3.3). The rate coeﬃcients of these reactions are calcu-
lated by using a temperature independent semi-empirical for-
mula proposed by Bates (1983). This yielded a very slow
rate of formation and thus very unlikely to be formed in
the Crab environment. However, the formula provided by
Bates (1983) to calculate the rate coeﬃcients is temperature-
independent and was approximated for the temperature of
∼ 30 K. In the condition relevant to the Crab (temperature
∼ 2000 − 3000 K) this semi-empirical relation might under-
estimate the rate. To have an educated estimation of their for-
mation, we considered an upper limit of these rates (∼ 10−10
cm3 s−1). In case of ArOH+ and NeOH+ formation, the dom-
inant pathway in our network is the reaction between ArH+
and O and NeH+ and O respectively (reaction 13, see Ta-
ble 3). For HeOH+ formation, the reaction between He+ and
OH dominates (reaction 12 of He chemistry network). Due
to this reason, ArOH+ and NeOH+ abundance proﬁles follow
the ArH+ and NeH+ abundance proﬁles respectively, whereas
HeOH+ roughly follows the abundance proﬁle of OH. We
noticed that only with the upper limit of the formation, abun-
dances of these species are signiﬁcant. Otherwise, the for-
mation time scale is much slower and thus very unlikely to
be formed in the Crab environment. But the pathways pro-
posed here are very useful to study their formation in the
other sources where they have a much longer time for their
formation.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The detection of ArH+ ions in the Crab ﬁlament inspired us
to study the presence of other hydride and hydroxyl cations in
the same environment. Moreover, to check the detectability
of other noble gas hydride and hydroxyl cations, we modeled
a Crab ﬁlament using the spectral synthesis code, Cloudy. A
wide range of parameter space was used to suitably explain
the observational aspects. We have checked that under the
conditions of the Crab Nebula using steady-state chemistry
is justiﬁed for our best-ﬁtted models. Our ﬁndings are high-
lighted below:

• We prepared a realistic chemical network to study the
chemical evolution of the hydride and hydroxyl cations
of the various isotopes of Ar, Ne, and He. We did not
consider any fractionation reactions between the iso-
topologues. We found that the abundances of 36ArH+,
20NeH+, and HeH+ are comparable to the abundance
of OH+ in the Crab ﬁlament. Considering the up-
per limit of the formation rate, we obtained a rea-
sonably high abundances of 36ArOH+, 20NeOH+, and
HeOH+. However, using the realistic rates of these
reactions, we obtained very low abundances of these
hydroxyl ions. It is thus important to accurately mea-
sure/estimate these rates.

• In the diﬀuse ISM, we found that the XH+ (X=Ar,
Ne, and He) fractional abundance is reasonably high
and could have been identiﬁed. For example, we
found peak fractional abundance ∼ 1.3 × 10−9 for
36ArH+.
20NeH+ seems to be also highly abun-
dant (peak abundance ∼ 5 × 10−8) when reaction 5a
(Ne+ + H2 → NeH+ + H) of Ne chemistry is consid-
ered. However, its peak fractional abundance signiﬁ-
cantly drops (∼ 3 × 10−11) in absence of this pathway.
We obtained the peak fractional abundance of HeH+
∼ 3 × 10−11.

• We found that a high value of cosmic-ray ionization
rate ( ζ
∼ 106−7) with a total hydrogen density few
ζ0
times 104−6 cm−3 can successfully reproduce the abso-
lute surface brightness of the two transitions of 36ArH+
(242 and 485 µm), 308 µm transition of OH+, and 2.12
µm transition of H2.

• With the favourable values of nH and ζ/ζ0, we are able
to successfully explain the observed surface brightness
ratio between (a) 2 − 1 and 1 − 0 transition of 36ArH+,
(b) two transitions (2 − 1 and 1 − 0) of 36ArH+ and the
308 µm transition of OH+, and (c) various transitions
of CO with respect to the 308 µm transition of OH+.
Our best suitable case can explain the surface bright-
ness ratio obtained by Priestley et al. (2017) between

the transitions (a) HeH+ and 146 µm of [O i], and (b)
3 − 2 and 2 − 1 of HeH+. It can also explain the surface
brightness ratio between the transitions (a) 63 µm and
146 µm of [O i], and (b) 146 µm of [O i] and 158 µm
of [C ii] observed by Gomez et al. (2012) using Her-
schel PACS and ISO Long Wavelength Spectrometer
(LWS) ﬂuxes for infrared ﬁne structure emission lines.
However, our Model A always overproduces the sur-
face brightness of [C i] and even around the low AV re-
gion, we have the fractional abundance of CO and OH
∼ 10−11 − 10−9. Major reason for this is the obtained
electron temperature (∼ 4000 K) with Model A. We
found that our Model B requires a much higher elec-
tron temperature (> 10000 K) to explain most of the
observed features in the Crab ﬁlamentary region.

• The optical depth of the most probable transitions of
the XH+ and XOH+ (where X=Ar, Ne, and He) were
calculated for the Crab. Analyzing the obtained results,
we noticed that the 485 µm, 242 µm, and 162 µm tran-
sitions of 36ArH+; 96 µm, 72µm, 58µm, and 48 µm
transitions of 20NeH+; and 75 µm and 50 µm transi-
tions of HeH+ are most likely to be identiﬁed with a
space based observation. However, the fate of detect-
ing XOH+ in the similar environment with the similar
facility is very diﬃcult.

• We calculated the ground vibrational and equilibrium
values of rotational constants and asymmetrically re-
duced quartic centrifugal distortion constants for var-
ious isotopologues of ArOH+ and NeOH+, and com-
pared with the theoretically calculated values of Theis
& Fortenberry (2016). We also provided these con-
stants for HeOH+ which was not available till date.
Moreover, we provided the catalog ﬁles as per JPL
style for various isotopologues of ArOH+ and NeOH+
(with both the ground vibrational and equilibrium ro-
tational constants of Theis & Fortenberry 2016), and
HeOH+ (with our calculated ground vibrational and
equilibrium values) which might enable their future as-
tronomical detection in other sources.

APPENDIX

A. X-RAY IONIZATION

A.0.1. Direct X-ray ionization

In Table 3, we have pointed out the direct X-ray ionization
rates in reaction number 25-26 for Ar, 26-27 for Ne, and
17-18 for He. Rate constants are computed by the method
discussed in the following.

We used the direct (or primary) ionization rate of species i

at a certain depth z into the ﬁlament as:

ζXR = ζi,prim =

(cid:90) Emax

Emin

σi(E)

F(E, z)
E

dE s−1 ,

(A1)

where the integration bound is the spectral range of the emit-
ted energy ([Emin,Emax]=[1,10] keV (Meijerink & Spaans
2005) for the entire X-ray rate calculations). The ionization
cross section σi(E) at energy E is calculated by using the
eqn. A2 and A3 and the parameters provided in Table A1.
Verner & Yakovlev (1995) used a ﬁtting procedure proposed
by Kamrukov et al. (1983) for partial photo-ionization cross
section σnl(E) for diﬀerent atoms and ions:

σi(E) = σnl(E) = σ0F(y), y = E/E0,

, Q = 5.5 + l − 0.5P,

(A3)
where n is the principle quantum number of the shell,
l = 0, 1, 2 (or s, p, d) is the sub shell orbital quantum number,
E is the photon energy in eV, σ0=σ0(nl, Z, N), E0=E0(nl, Z,
N), yw, ya, and P are the ﬁtting parameters given in Table
A1 (Z and N are the atomic number and number of electrons
respectively). Verner & Yakovlev (1995) noticed that F(y) is
a “nearly universal” function for all species (Z, N) at a ﬁxed
shell nl.

A.0.2. Secondary X-ray ionization

Part of the kinetic energy of fast photoelectrons is lost by
ionizations. These secondary ionizations are far more impor-
tant for H, H2, and He than direct ionization. The energy
carried away by the fast photo electrons and Auger electrons
are very eﬃcient in ionizing the other species. For example,
these electrons can readily ionize H, He, and H2 and decay
back to ground state by the removal of UV photons. These
photons can trigger the induced chemistry and are very im-
portant for the chemical network. The secondary ionization
rate per hydrogen molecule at depth z into the ﬁlament can
be calculated using:

ζH2,XRPHOT = ζi,sec =

(cid:90) Emax

σpa(E)F(E, z)

Emin

E
Wx(H2)

dE s−1,

(A6)
where x(H2) is the fractional abundance of H2 with respect to
total hydrogen nuclei and W is the mean energy per ion pair.
For our calculations, we considered x(H2) ∼ 2 × 10−4, which
means that most of hydrogen is in atomic form. Dalgarno
et al. (1999) calculated W for pure ionized H-He and H2-He
mixtures for E between 30 eV and 1 keV and parameterized
W as

W = W0(1 + Cxα),
(A7)
where x = 0.1 is considered as the ionization fraction and W0
is the value for neutral gas. W0, C, and α are given in Table
4 of Dalgarno et al. (1999). We took those values (W0=48.6
eV, C=9.13, and α=0.807) only for pure He gas for 1 keV.
Following Meijerink & Spaans (2005), we integrated over
the range 1 − 10 keV and W goes to a limiting value (42.69
eV). We considered the parameters for the 1 keV electron to
determine the electron energy deposition, since these param-
eters do not change for higher energies. The X-ray photo-
ionization rate then simpliﬁes to,

The ﬂux F(E,z) in eqn. A1 at depth z into the ﬁlament is

given by:

ζH2,XRPHOT = ζi,sec =

1keV
W(1keV)x(H2)

(A8)

(cid:1),

F(E, z) = F(E, z = 0)exp(cid:0) − σpa(E)NH
where NH ∼ 4.77 × 1021 cm−2 is considered as the total col-
umn density of hydrogen nuclei and F(E, z = 0) = 0.35 erg
cm−2 s−1 is considered as the ﬂux at the surface of the cloud.
The photoelectric absorption cross section per hydrogen nu-
cleus, σpa used in eqn. A4 is given by:

(A4)

σpa(E) =

(cid:88)

i

Ai(total)σi(E),

(A5)

where Ai(total) is the total (gas and dust) elemental abun-
dances used.

(cid:90) Emax

Emin

σpa(E)F(E, z)dE s−1 .

The photon energy absorbed per hydrogen nucleus HX is
given by

(cid:90) Emax

HX =

σpa(E)F(E, z)dE.

(A9)

Emin
Hence, the X-ray photo-ionization rate is given by,

ζH2,XRPHOT = ζi,sec =

1keV
W(1keV)x(H2)

HX s−1.

(A10)

Following Priestley et al. (2017), we multiplied ζH2,XRPHOT
by 0.8

1−ω , where ω is the grain albedo (∼ 0.5).

sional rates, we considered the same collisional rates for all
these hydroxyl ions that were provided by Hamilton et al.
(2016) for the ArH+. We considered their transitions further
for the modeling. However, looking at the transitions of the
ﬁrst 12 levels, for the case of ArOH+, we obtained the high-
est frequency at 318 GHz and for NeOH+ at 437 GHz. These
frequencies are not in the range of SPIRE or PACS. How-
ever, these transitions are falling within the observed range of
ALMA, IRAM 30m, and NOEMA. In case of HeOH+, most
of the frequencies arising are falling within the range of Her-
schel SPIRE, SOFIA, ALMA, IRAM 30m, and NOEMA.

B. SPECTROSCOPIC INFORMATION
Spectroscopic information of ArH+, NeH+, and HeH+ is
already available in the CDMS catalog. However, NeH+ and
HeH+ are yet to be identiﬁed in the Crab environment. The
1 → 0 (2010.18 GHz) and 2 → 1 (4008.73 GHz) transitions
of HeH+ are falling in the range of SOFIA and PACS instru-
ment of Herschel. The 1 → 0 of NeH+ (1039.25 GHz) is
well within the range of SPIRE instrument of Herschel and
SOFIA whereas the 2 → 1 transition of NeH+ (2076.57 GHz)
is falling in the PACS and SOFIA limit. We prepared the col-
lisional data ﬁles for NeH+ and HeH+ to study the observ-
ability of the transitions of the hydride ions. For the prepara-
tion of the collisional data ﬁle, we considered that electrons
are the only colliding partners. We used the electron impact
excitation of HeH+ from Hamilton et al. (2016) for this col-
lisional data ﬁle. For NeH+, no collisional rates were avail-
able, and thus we approximated the collisional rates of NeH+
by considering the collisional rates of ArH+ − e−.

One of the aims of this paper is to study the emission line of
hydroxyl ions of the noble gases. Recently, Theis & Forten-
berry (2016) calculated rotational constants for the various
isotopologues of ArOH+ and NeOH+. However, the spectro-
scopic information of the HeOH+ is not yet available. Here,
we have carried out quantum-chemical calculation by using
Gaussian 09 program to ﬁnd out these rotational parame-
ters. We computed the rotational constants and asymmet-
rically reduced quartic centrifugal distortion constants with
DFT B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory which are use-
ful to provide the spectral information in the THz domain.
Obtained ground vibrational and equilibrium values of the
rotational constants and asymmetrically reduced quartic cen-
trifugal distortion constants along with the ground vibra-
tional and equilibrium values calculated by Theis & Forten-
berry (2016) for comparison are given in Table B1. More-
over, we used SPCAT (Pickett 1991) program to ﬁnd out
the rotational transitions of these species, which are falling
in between the THz domain. We have supplied the ob-
tained spectral information ﬁles as the supplementary mate-
rials with this paper. As per the JPL catalog style, we re-
named the cat ﬁles of 36ArOH+ as c053009.cat, 38ArOH+
20NeOH+ as
as c055003.cat,
22NeOH+ as c039007.cat, and HeOH+ as
c037006.cat,
c021003.cat. For the preparation of the spectral information
for ArOH+ and NeOH+, we used both the ground vibrational
and equilibrium values of rotational constants calculated by
Theis & Fortenberry (2016), whereas, in the case of HeOH+,
we used our calculated parameters. For the preparation of the
collisional data ﬁle, we considered the interaction between
their ﬁrst 11 levels. This upper limit of the level is because of
the absence of collisional rates of ArH+ for the upper levels
(Hamilton et al. 2016). Since for the case of hydroxyl ions,
we do not have any ﬁrst-hand approximation for the colli-

C. MODEL B

For the modeling of the Crab H2 emitting knot, we fol-
low the ionizing particle model of Richardson et al. (2013)
as Model B. The adopted physical parameters and the gas
phase elemental abundances with respect to total hydrogen
nuclei in all forms are summerized in Tables 1 and 2 for the
Model B. For detail information please see the Sections 2
and 4.2.2. The results obtained using Model B are shown in
Figures C1-C6.
