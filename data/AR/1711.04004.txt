Abstract. Potassium-40 (40K) is a background in many rare-event searches and may well play
a role in interpreting results from the DAMA dark-matter search. The electron-capture decay of
40K to the ground state of 40Ar has never been measured and contributes an unknown amount
of background. The KDK (potassium decay) collaboration will measure this branching ratio
using a 40K source, an X-ray detector, and the Modular Total Absorption Spectrometer at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory.

1. Introduction
Many lines of evidence suggest that most of the matter in the universe is dark, and possibly made
of some new type of exotic particle [1] . Experiments have been seeking dark-matter particles for
close to three decades. The DAMA collaboration claims to have discovered them based on an
annual modulation in the spectra observed in NaI detectors [2], but this claim is controversial,
as it is in strong tension with a number of experiments that use diﬀerent techniques and target
materials [3]. In addition, DAMA has not provided a background model for its claim, and disputes
external attempts to do so [4, 5]. It has recently been pointed out that an unmeasured decay of
40K could strongly constrain the dark-matter interpretation of the DAMA claim [5]. 40K decays
to 40Ar by electron capture [6], emitting X-rays and Auger electrons having energy close to 3 keV,
within the signal region for dark matter. Most of these decays (EC*), with a branching ratio of
BR∗ = (10.55±0.11)%, are to an excited state of 40Ar, which returns to ground state by emitting
a 1.46 MeV γ thereby allowing one to tag the low-energy quanta. However, direct decays to the
ground state (EC) are expected as well, with no means to tag the low-energy emissions. These
direct decays are expected to be 50 times less frequent than those to the excited state. Untagged

 
 
 
 
 
 
low-energy emissions from 40K constrain the time-independent portion of the signal claimed by
DAMA, and therefore its modulation fraction, which itself must be consistent with astrophysical
distributions. The KDK (potassium decay) collaboration proposes to measure this classical, but
rare, branching ratio, which is the only known unique third forbidden electron-capture transition.

2. Experimental setup
In KDK, measuring ζ = BR/BR∗, the ratio of the EC and EC* branching ratios, will involve
the setup illustrated in Fig. 1:

• a 40K source,
• a small, sensitive detector to trigger on the X-rays from electron captures of all types (to

ground state: EC, to excited state: EC*),

• a large surrounding veto to tag 1.46 MeV γs and distinguish between EC and EC* decays.

Our baseline design employs a source (discussed in Sec. 3) that is separate from the X-ray
detector.

experiment.

Setup of the KDK

For the X-ray detector, the requirements are a threshold well below 3 keV, a surface area
comparable to the ∼ 1 cm2 of the source, and a limited amount of matter to reduce parasitic
scattering of high-energy γs. Although oﬀ-the-shelf large-area avalanche-photodiodes (APDs) of
type S1315 from Radiation Monitoring Devices have been used initially (Fig. 2), they are being
replaced by custom silicon drift-detectors with a better resolution of 170 eV FWHM at 6 keV [7]
(Fig.3).

The veto has stringent eﬃciency requirements. Given that a single EC is expected for 50 EC*,
to ensure that there is no more than one mis-tagged EC* for each true EC, the veto eﬃciency
must be at least 98%. In other words, for each X-ray from EC* that triggers the X-ray detector,
the detection eﬃciency of the related 1.46 MeV γ must be at least 98%, including geometry,
absorption of the veto, and electronics. This implies that the veto must cover nearly a full solid
angle around the source and X-ray detector. In addition, given that the attenuation length of
1.46 MeV γs is relatively long (i.e. 5.7 cm in NaI [8]), the veto must be quite thick (i.e.
in
NaI, to ensure that a γ has a 99% chance of interacting, the thickness must be at least 26 cm).
The Modular Total Absorption Spectrometer (MTAS) [9, 10, 11] at Oak Ridge satisﬁes these
requirements.
It is a ∼ 1 Ton array of NaI(Tl) scintillators with a hole through the center
where the 40K source and X-ray detector will be placed. Its eﬃciency is of the correct order of

magnitude for the purpose of KDK, and will be determined precisely following the procedure in
Sec. 3.

Moreover, the collaboration has prepared a set of mechanical interfaces between the various

subsystems. Design constraints include:

• centring the source in MTAS, to maximize detection eﬃciency of γs
• minimizing distance between X-ray detector and source, to maximize detection eﬃciency of
X-rays (to the ﬁrst order, this ensures the experiment can be carried out with a reasonable
exposure)

• minimizing material near the source, to avoid parasitic scattering of γ rays
• cooling the X-ray detector to a temperature of the order of -20 C to reduce its noise
• keeping the source and X-ray detector in a vacuum to allow the detector to be cooled without

condensation

These constraints have been met using a thin-walled vacuum insert which houses the source and
X-ray detector, and slides into the opening in MTAS.

Lastly, KDK is also investigating an alternative to the separate source and X-ray detector.
KSr2I5 (KSI) is a recently-developed scintillator [12] with a density of 4.39 g/cm3, and an
excellent light yield of 95 photons/keV at 662 keV. This makes KSI an integrated source/detector
solution whose advantages include high 40K activity (6.56 Bq/cm3), and full absorption of all
low-energy emissions from electron capture. System will be triggered on a coincidence between
two photomultipliers on the KSI, then a signal will be sought in MTAS.

3. Eﬃciency and sources
To measure the ratio of branching ratios ζ = BR/BR∗ with a relative precision of 10%, the
eﬃciency of MTAS must be determined to a precision of 0.2%. This will be achieved using
radioactive isotopes with decay schemes similar to those of 40K, but with well-known branching
ratios. The ﬁrst such isotope is 54Mn [6].
It decays by electron capture, emitting ∼ 5 keV
atomic radiation, to an excited state of 54Cr, which relaxes by emitting an 835 keV γ, with an
overwhelming branching ratio of (99.9997 ± 0.0003)%. Data from a week-long 54Mn calibration
are presented in Fig. 2. Another isotope, with a more complicated decay scheme, but higher
energy γs (1115 keV) is 65Zn [6]. Results from both isotopes are being analyzed. Geant 4 Monte-
Carlo simulations will be used to extrapolate the tagging eﬃciencies at 835 keV and 1115 keV to
the 1460 keV relevant for 40K.

From the standpoint of the 40K source, the design goal is for it to contain ∼ 1018 atoms of
40K. The activity is equivalent to two bananas [13]. The geometry will be a disk of area ∼ 1 cm2,
and thickness of the order of 10 µm to allow suﬃcient activity while limiting self-absorption of
the 3 keV X-rays. Two approaches have been followed. In the ﬁrst, we carried out ion-beam
implantation of 40K on a thin carbon substrate. It was found that the number of 40K ions that
could be implanted was very limited due to self-sputtering, preventing the source from reaching
the required activity. A more promising approach is to use thermal deposition of 40K-enriched
KCl on a substrate. Tests with natural KCl indicate a mass-transfer eﬃciency of 30–50%. We
have demonstrated the production of the ﬁrst 40K source obtained by thermal deposition of 3%
enriched KCl. The source has about 3×1017 40K atoms in a KCl ﬁlm of about 9 µm thickness. Its
3 keV X-rays from EC* in coincidence with 1.46 MeV gammas have been observed, as illustrated
in Fig. 2. Work is proceeding to produce a stronger source starting from more-highly enriched
KCl material.

Lastly, all the calibration and 40K sources are manufactured in the same geometry and on

identical substrates to facilitate comparison.

the APD X-ray detector, ordinates are those in the MTAS tagger. Vertical smear represents
partial energy deposits (eg Compton interactions) in MTAS. Horizontal smear is attributed to
superﬁcial interactions in the APD (low energies) and to inhomogeneous response in plane of
APD (high energies). Right: APD spectrum of 3 keV X-rays in coincidence with 1.46 MeV γs

4. Blinding strategy
To avoid introducing conscious or unconscious biases into our analysis, we have adopted a blinding
strategy for KDK. It will be of "hidden signal box" type [14]. Here, the signal box represents
X-rays that are not coincident with γs. All cuts will be developed on the coincident X-rays and
γs. The energy width of the coincident X-ray line will be used to set the width of the signal box.
Backgrounds in the signal region will be estimated from those adjacent to it. Once these steps
have been completed, the signal box will be opened and a likelihood analysis carried out on the
data. Should an error be found in the analysis after unblinding, we will report both the blinded
result and the corrected one.

5. Conclusions and outlook
KDK will measure the branching ratio of the electron capture decay of 40K to the ground state of
40Ar. This result will help interpret the longstanding DAMA claim for discovery of dark matter.
It will be of interest to the host of experiments about to test DAMA with NaI detectors (including
ANAIS [15], COSINE [16], COSINUS [17], PICO-LON [18] and SABRE [19]), and rare-event
searches in general since 40K is a common background. Moreover, 40K may radioactively heat

the cores of planets, including Earth [20], and a precise measurement of the EC branching ratio
will be valuable to geochronology and 40K-40Ar dating [21].

The main infrastructure of KDK, including the MTAS tagger and interfaces, is in place. First
eﬃciency measurements have been performed using various radioactive sources and an APD as
X-ray detector, and are being analyzed. X-rays have been observed in coincidence with γ rays
from a ﬁrst 40K source, while preserving the uncoincident X-rays as blind. A stronger 40K source
is being prepared. Moreover, new silicon drift-detectors are being commissioned; they oﬀer an
energy resolution improved by nearly an order of magnitude compared to the APDs, insurance
against possible backgrounds including β− decays of 40K. Lastly, KSI scintillator may provide
an additional tool for this measurement.
