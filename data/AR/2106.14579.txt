ABSTRACT

Coronal loop observations have existed for many decades yet the precise shape of these fundamental coronal
structures is still widely debated since the discovery that they appear to undergo negligible expansion between
their footpoints and apex. In this work a selection of eight EUV loops and their twenty-two sub-element strands
are studied from the second successful ﬂight of NASA’s High resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C 2.1). Four of the
loops correspond to open fan structures with the other four considered to be magnetically closed loops. Width
analysis is performed on the loops and their sub-resolution strands using our method of ﬁtting multiple Gaussian
proﬁles to cross-sectional intensity slices. It is found that whilst the magnetically closed loops and their sub-
element strands do not expand along their observable length, open fan structures may expand an additional
150 % of their initial width. Following recent work, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between peak intensity
and loop/strand width are found to be predominantly positively correlated for the loops (
88 %) and their
sub-element strands (
80 %). These results align with the hypothesis of Klimchuk & DeForest that loops and
– for the ﬁrst time – their sub-element strands have approximately circular cross-sectional proﬁles.

1. INTRODUCTION

It has long been shown that coronal loops may have uni-
form cross sectional widths along their observable length
(Klimchuk et al. 1992; Klimchuk 2000; Watko & Klimchuk
2000) where the cross-sectional proﬁle is roughly circular.
This behaviour is contrary to what one would expect; that is,
ﬂux tubes and thus coronal loops are expected to expand with
height to maintain the pressure balance between the internal
and external loop plasma due to gravitational stratiﬁcation
and decreasing magnetic ﬁeld strength. This perceived circu-
lar cross-section may be explained by locally twisted ﬂux
tubes (Klimchuk et al. 2000; L´opez Fuentez & Klimchuk
2006) which have been demonstrated to undergo less expan-
sion than untwisted structures (McClymont & Mikic 1994).
(2013) of-
fer an explanation for the perceived lack of expansion in
loop observations that one would expect – the loops may
have non-circular cross sections such as an ellipse. As
noted by Klimchuk & DeForest (2020),
if the expansion
occurs preferentially along the line of sight, i.e.
radially,
rather than in the image plane, then no contradiction occurs.
Malanushenko & Schrijver (2013) propose that because the
coronal plasma is optically thin, loops expanding along the

The ﬁndings of Malanushenko & Schrijver

line of sight will be brighter in the image plane, which causes
a selection bias as the brightness will decrease less rapidly as
a function of height due to the increasing line of sight depth
towards the apex. Whilst it is possible that the cross-sectional
aspect ratio may change along a loop’s length, it is also pos-
sible that the aspect ratio remains ﬁxed and merely rotates
around a central axis, such as a twisting ribbon/rubber band
(McCarthy et al. 2021). However, if that were the case then
a loop would experience localised brightening and dimming
along its length. That is, if we consider the twisting of an
oval cross section, then there is more (less) material along
the line of sight when the semi-minor (major) cross-sectional
axis is lined preferentially with the observer, which leads to
brighter (dimmer) intensity in the 2D projection of observa-
tional data due to the increased (decreased) plasma along the
line of sight.
To test

this hypothesis, Klimchuk & DeForest (2020)
analyse the relationship between peak intensity and cross-
sectional width of twenty coronal loops within the 193 ˚A
High Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C; Kobayashi et al.
2014) data-set whose lengths are < 60 Mm. They ﬁnd that
these two properties were either positively correlated or un-
correlated but not negatively correlated, suggesting the cross

sections of the loops could be approximately circular. More
recently, McCarthy et al. (2021) utilised observations from
two vantage points with 171 ˚A data from both Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory’s (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and Solar Terrestrial Relation Ob-
servatory’s (STEREO) Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI;
Howard et al. 2008). From their sample of 151 loops, they
identiﬁed thirteen as being suitable for width analysis. Util-
ising diameter-diameter measurements and peak intensity vs.
loop width graphs, McCarthy et al. (2021) deduce that four
of the thirteen loops may be elliptical with the remaining nine
loops being approximately circular in shape. However, the
diameter-diameter measurements are unlikely to be reliable
given the lower resolution of EUVI, especially when AIA
has been shown to be incapable of resolving – or in some
instances detecting – narrower loops (Williams et al. 2020a).
As is discussed in Klimchuk (2000), the lack of cross-
sectional expansion in loop observations have important im-
plications for coronal heating models. The ﬁrst is that en-
ergy may be deposited in an axial symmetric manner at
the same spatial scales as the diameter of monolithic coro-
nal loops/strands (full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) .
200 km; Williams et al. 2020a,b). Alternatively, the energy
deposited within strands and loops occur at spatial scales
much smaller than the diameters of these structures – per-
haps on spatial scales as small as 15 km (Peter et al. 2013) –
and is then transported orthogonal to the loop abscissa in an
axisymmetric manner. One popular mechanism for the latter
scenario is the nanoﬂare heating model (Parker 1983, 1988)
whereby ﬁeld lines become braided and undergo small-scale
magnetic reconnection due to photospheric motion at the
footpoints.

In light of recent Hi-C ﬁndings indicating that mono-
lithic loops may have approximately circular cross sec-
tions that exhibit no expansion along their observable length
(Klimchuk & DeForest 2020), this paper employs the meth-
ods used in previous studies (§ 2) to examine the spatial
scales along the loop envelope (Williams et al. 2020a) and
individual loop sub-element strands (Williams et al. 2020b)
of eight distinct coronal structures.
In § 3, the relation-
ship between loop width and their peak intensities are ex-
plored to classify whether their cross sections may be ap-
proximately circular (Klimchuk & DeForest 2020) or oval
such as a twisted ribbon (Malanushenko & Schrijver 2013;
McCarthy et al. 2021). For the ﬁrst time, this study also
extends this analysis to the sub-element strands contained
within coronal loops and a discussion of these results in
the context of current literature and the authors’ concluding
remarks are presented in § 4.

2. DATA PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS METHOD
On 29th May 2018 at 18:54 UT, Hi-C 2.1 was successfully
relaunched from the White Sands Missile Range, NM, USA,
4.4′
capturing high-resolution data (2k
ﬁeld of view) of target active region AR 12712 in EUV emis-
sion of wavelength 172 ˚A (dominated by Fe IX emission
0.8 MK) with a plate scale of 0.129′′. During the ﬂight
≈
Hi-C 2.1 captured 78 images with a 2s exposure time and a
4.4s cadence between 18:56 and 19:02 UT. Full details on the
Hi-C 2.1 instrument can be found in Rachmeler et al. (2019).

2.1. Data-set Extraction and Background Subtraction

The basis of the sample data-set investigated here include a
number of subsets from the ten higher-emission cross-section
slices analysed by Williams et al. (2020a) plus nine other ad-
ditional slices from within the Hi-C 2.1 ﬁeld of view (see Fig-
ure 1 where all data-set locations are indicated). In each case
the resulting emission proﬁle across the structures would in-
dicate sub-structure strands that are not fully resolved.

≈

Following the method outlined in (Williams et al. 2020a),
the Hi-C 2.1 data-set under consideration is time-averaged
60 s that is free from spacecraft jitter1. Each
over a period
cross-section normal to each strand is taken to be 3-pixels
deep and the background emission is then subtracted. As
outlined in Figure 2 of Williams et al. (2020b), this back-
ground subtraction is performed by ﬁrstly ﬁnding all the lo-
cal minima of a slice, and interpolating through these val-
ues using a cubic spline (Yi et al. 2015) to obtain a global
trend (dashed blue line). The global trend is then sub-
tracted from the intensity proﬁle along the slice, leaving be-
hind the background subtracted coronal strands (similar to
Aschwanden & Schrijver 2011; Williams et al. 2020a). Due
to the large number of counts detected by Hi-C 2.1 the Pois-
son error associated with these isolated coronal strands is
minimal.

2.2. Gaussian Fitting and FWHM Measurements

The analysis method is based on the assumption that at rest,
an isolated coronal strand element has an observed emission
proﬁle across its width and normal to the strand axis that is
approximately Gaussian. It is important to note that as indi-
cated by Pontin et al. (2017), instantaneously coronal strands
may not necessarily have a clear Gaussian cross-section. On
the other hand, (Klimchuk & DeForest 2020) have shown
from Hi-C observations that coronal strands are likely to
have Gaussian cross-sections. The data samples are time-
60 s (the ﬁrst 11 Hi-C 2.1 frames) to average
averaged over

≈

1 A consequence of the instability experienced during the Hi-C 2.1 ﬂight
is that ghosting of the mesh could not be avoided (Rachmeler et al. 2019).
This leads to the diamond patterns across the entire Hi-C 2.1 ﬁeld-of-view,
which are exaggerated when the data is enhanced with MGN (Figure 1).

out variations over short timescales, which helps address this
issue. Whilst no obvious signs of motion within the struc-
tures analysed are noticed in this 60 s window, the authors
acknowledge that as indicated by Morton & McLaughlin
(2013), small amplitude oscillations could be present which
would lead to the measured widths being broader than the
structural width due to the time integration performed.

The observed Hi-C 2.1 intensity proﬁle of a cross-sectional
slice is reproduced by simultaneously ﬁtting Gaussian pro-
ﬁles, the number of which is determined by the Akaike Infor-
mation Criterion (Akaike 1974, AIC) along with a corrective
term (AICc) for small sample sizes. This is fully described in
the Appendix of Williams et al. (2020b). Subsequently, the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian proﬁle
is measured to provide an estimate of the possible width of
the sub-structures likely present within the Hi-C 2.1 data.

Thus, the method employed to ﬁt Gaussian proﬁles to the
observed Hi-C 2.1 intensity is as follows. Firstly, the follow-
ing expression for a Gaussian function, YG is used:

YG = A exp

,

(cid:19)

(1)

whereby x is position along the cross-section slice, A and
xp are the amplitude and location of the peak, and W is the

≈

Gaussian RMS width. This can be related to the FWHM by:
FWHM = 2 √2 ln 2 W
2.35 W .
An estimate is made on the number of structures, N that
could be present within the intensity proﬁle along with their
approximate location, width, and amplitude. Summing the
YG values for N number of Gaussian curves at each pixel
yields the model ﬁt:

f (x) =

YG(i) (x) .

The closeness of the ﬁt at each pixel, χ2 (x) is then deter-
mined by measuring the deviation of the ﬁt from the original
intensity:

where y (x) and σ (x) are the observed Hi-C 2.1 intensity and
Poisson error at each pixel. The overall closeness of ﬁt is then
χ2 (x), which is then reduced to its smallest value
taken as
by simultaneously adjusting the free parameters A, xp, and
W for the N Gaussian curves in f (x). The minimisation of
χ2 (x) is performed by using the non-linear least-squares

curve ﬁtting method, MPFIT 2 (Markwardt 2009) which is
based on the MINPACK-1 FORTRAN library (Mor´e 1978).
The one-σ uncertainties returned from MPFIT are only ac-
curate if the shape of the likelihood surface is well approx-
imated by a parabolic function. Whether ﬁtting multiple
Gaussian proﬁles to each slice satisﬁes this condition or not
would require analysis beyond the scope of this study, how-
ever, the one-σ uncertainties do provide a lower-bound of the
FWHM errors.

To determine the appropriate number of Gaussian proﬁles,
N , within a given slice, the AIC model selection is employed.
This is done by ﬁrstly generating several candidate models,
where the number of Gaussian curves differs in each model.
The non-linear least-squares curve ﬁtting method is then em-
ployed for each candidate model and ﬁnally the AICc is then
computed. The model with the smallest AICc value is then
selected as the preferred model for that Hi-C 2.1 slice. Once
the number of Gaussian proﬁles contained within a Hi-C 2.1
slice is determined, the strand width(s) are taken as the Gaus-
sian FWHM value(s).

Klimchuk & DeForest (2020) states that this type of analy-
sis is sensitive to background subtraction, and as such we ﬁnd
the number of Gaussian proﬁles ﬁtted to a Hi-C 2.1 slice can
be inﬂuenced by unwanted features such as other loops cross-
ing in-front/behind the loop(s) or underlying moss regions.
Whilst concerted efforts are made to avoid these regions,
this is not always possible, and these unwanted “overlaps” of
coronal structures result in differing numbers of sub-element
strands being ﬁtted by the AICc method compared to slices
either side of the “overlaps”. Consequently, as this study
aims to measure the changes in structural width and emis-
sion measure not only along loop segments but also along
sub-element strands that may reside within these structures,
a consistent number of Gaussian proﬁles is required to be ﬁt-
ted for the analysed portion of the loop(s). It is reasonable to
assume the number of sub-element strands along a loop seg-
ment would be consistent and thus the cross-sectional slices
where the number of Gaussian proﬁles determined by the
AICc model selection do not match the modal value are likely
to be contaminated with other coronal features along the line
of sight. With this in mind, the sub-element strands are only
analysed for the cross-sectional slices where the number of
Gaussian proﬁles matches the modal value of Gaussian’s for
the whole loop segment in question. A consequence of this
conservative approach to ﬁtting sub-element strands is that it
is not always possible to analyse the structures along the en-
tire loop segment. However, measuring the width of the loop-
envelope has no such constraints, and the method employed

in Williams et al. (2020a) is adopted with the improved back-
ground subtraction discussed in Williams et al. (2020b).

3. RESULTS & ANALYSIS

A total of eight loops are selected from the Hi-C 2.1 ﬁeld-
of-view (FOV, Figure 1) that are relatively free from emis-
sion of surrounding coronal structures. From the selection of
Hi-C 2.1 loops chosen for this study, loops A, B, C, and E
are from open fan regions3 whilst loops D, F, G, and H are
magnetically closed structures. In the analysis that follows,
the orientation of loops D, F, and G are north-to-south (i.e.
position 0 is at the top of the close-up images of Figure 1)
whereas the other loops are orientated south-to-north such
that the segments of the structures are traced away from their
nearest footpoint. The AICc determined modal number of
sub-element strands within loops A, D, E, G, and H is three,
whilst loops B and C contain four strands, and Loop F has
only two.

As can be seen in the FOV image, selecting a segment of a
coronal loop that is isolated from surrounding coronal struc-
tures and the ghosting of the CCD mesh cells is a non-trivial
task due to the abundance of loop-like structures and the un-
derlying moss in AR 12712. Focusing on the close-up images
of loops A - H in Figure 1 reveals that even the best-case loop
segments we have selected here are not completely isolated
from other coronal features or the mesh cell ghosting. For ex-
ample, it is not possible to examine a longer portion of loop
A as the segment analysed (denoted by the dashed line) is en-
closed on both ends by the ghosting of a mesh cell. Similarly,
despite loop D having a high contrast compared to the sur-
rounding corona in the Multi-scale Gaussian Normalisation-
enhanced images (Morgan & Druckm¨uller 2014), there are
several structures that intersect the loop and thus affect the
background subtraction.

3.1. Width Analysis

In Figures 2 and 3 the top panels labelled B1 – B6 and
H1 – H16 show the Hi-C 2.1 cross-sectional intensity (blue),
the AICc determined best-ﬁt (red), and the Gaussian proﬁles
(grey) that generate the ﬁt. The intensity of these panels are
normalised with respect to the maximum peak intensity of
the loop segment being considered. The same ﬁgures for
the other six loops are shown in the Appendix (Figures 6 –
11). In all these plots for loops A – H it is possible to follow
the individual strands from one cross-sectional slice to the
next along the loop segments analysed. As with previous
results using this method (Williams et al. 2020b), the AICc
determined ﬁts closely match the observed Hi-C 2.1 cross-
sectional proﬁles in most instances, with some minor excep-

expectation that these loops are fan structures and not large, closed loops.

south-to-north orientation in Figure 1.

to reduce the deviance between the generated ﬁts and the Hi-
C 2.1 emission by adding further Gaussian proﬁles, however,
in doing so the curve ﬁtting model would no longer be sup-
ported by the AICc model selection method and would in-
crease the likelihood of over-ﬁtting the data along the length
of the loop segments analysed.

The bottom panels of Figures 2 and 3 show the variation
in loop (black) and strand (cyan, magenta, green, orange)
widths as a function of loop position. The error bars for
the loop width indicate a Hi-C 2.1 pixel width (93.525 km)
whereas the error bars of the strands are the one-σ errors re-
turned from MPFIT. From the eight loops considered, six of
them show no signs of signiﬁcant expansion, whereas the two
loops that do (B and E) are open fan structures and may be
expected to expand. Curiously, A and C are also open fan
structures yet their widths remain largely constant along the
segments analysed. It could be the case that these structures
have undergone expansion closer to the footpoints as with
loops B and E, however, this cannot be veriﬁed in this data-
set with our current methods.

Figure 4 shows the separation between the peak intensity
of neighbouring sub-element strands as a function of loop po-
sition for the loops A – H. Increasing loop position for loops
A, B, C, D, and H (E, F, and G) correspond to south-to-north
(north-to-south) orientation in Figure 1. Focusing upon the
six loops that show no obvious expansion, their sub-element
strands also exhibit no expansion (Figures 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11)
or separation between adjacent strands (Figure 4). Of these
loops, only loops C and F show initial and ﬁnal widths that
are above the observational error of two Hi-C 2.1 pixel widths
(187.05 km). For loop C, this level of expansion is insignif-
icant (80 km above 2 Hi-C 2.1 pixels), and the close prox-
imity of a loop to the east whose intensity increases when
tracing the structure in a south-to-north orientation (Figure 1)
may effect the background subtraction performed on loop C,
which would account for the decreased width seen from loop
position 14 Mm onward in Figure 7. For loop F, the width is
predominantly the same along the loop segment until a sud-
den decrease is seen in the ﬁnal three cross-sectional slices
(Figure 10). As can be seen in the cross-sectional slices and
from the visual reference in Figure 1, the loop intensity de-
creases relative to the surrounding loop bundle and thus the
magnitude of the loop intensity relative to the background
emission that is subtracted decreases, which may contribute
to the contraction in loop width indicated in Table 1.

To quantify the total expansion (Γtot) of each loop/strand,
the ﬁnal and initial widths of the segment analysed are calcu-
lated as the ratio

Γtot =

The expansion rate (Γrate) is then simply expressed as

that increasing Loop Position for loops A, B, C, D, and H (E, F,

Employing this on loops B and E, it can be seen that they
expand a total of

rates (Γrate) along their lengths of 4.2 % and 6.8 % per Mm,
respectively (Table 1). For Loop B, the widths of strands 1
and 2 remain within two pixel widths and as such do not con-
tribute to the expansion of Loop B, whilst strands 3 and 4

mains roughly constant, strands 2 and 3, and strands 3 and 4
spread apart along the loop segment under consideration. If
we consider the ﬁndings of McClymont & Mikic (1994) that
a twisted structure exhibits less expansion than an untwisted
structure, then it may be that strands 1 and 2 are twisted struc-
tures whilst strands 3 and 4 are subjected to less twist and
thus expand with height.

result of sub-element strands both expanding and separating
from each other simultaneously.

3.2. Intensity vs. Width

Following the work of Klimchuk & DeForest (2020), this
section investigates the relationship between the peak inten-
sity and width of the selected loops and, for the ﬁrst time,
extends this analysis to their sub-element strands. As is dis-
cussed in Klimchuk & DeForest (2020), a negative correla-
tion between width and intensity may indicate that a loop has
an elliptical cross-section whereas if there is no or positive
correlation, the cross-section is likely to be roughly circular.
Figure 5 top (bottom) shows the peak intensity of the loops
(strands) as a function of FWHM. From visual inspection it
can be seen that the peak intensities of loops B, C, and E ap-
pear strongly correlated to the widths of the structures whilst
the remaining loops have weaker correlations where it is not
possible to accurately determine whether the structures are
positively or negatively correlated. As for the peak intensity
of all the strands, they appear to predominantly be positively
correlated to their widths – albeit to varying degrees with the
strands of loop B showcasing the strongest correlation.

To quantify whether the peak intensity of cross-sectional
slices along a segment of a loop/strand is positively or neg-
atively correlated to the FWHM, the Pearson correlation co-
efﬁcient is determined, the results of which are presented in
Table 1. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, P is deﬁned as

P =

cov (FWHM, I)
σFWHM σI

,

(4)

where cov (W, I) is the covariance of FWHM and intensity,
whilst the denominator is the product of their standard devi-

Figure 5. Top: Peak intensities are plotted against their widths
for loops A – H. Bottom: Peak intensities of the strands contained
within loops A – H are plotted against their widths. No distinction
is made here about individual strands but rather the strands as a col-
lective for each loop, i.e. strands 1 – 3 of loop A are all plotted as
black asterisks, strands 1 – 3 of loop B are plotted as red asterisks,
strands 1 – 4 of loop C are plotted as blue asterisks, etc.

ations. If a structure has a positive (negative) Pearson corre-
lation then as the width increases the intensity increases (de-
creases). The coefﬁcient magnitude varies between -1 and
1 with values of P
0 corresponding to uncorrelated data,
whilst values of -1 and 1 correspond to perfectly correlated
data.

≈

From Table 1, it is found that all the peak intensities of
the four open fan loops are positively correlated to their
width, with loops B, C, and E being strongly correlated whilst
loop A displays weak-to-moderate positive correlation. The
weaker correlation of loop A is likely due to the fact that
the structure exhibits minimal variation in the peak intensity
and its width along the segment analysed, and so deducing
a relationship between the two is more difﬁcult. As for the
sub-element strands within the four open fan structures, a to-
tal of three strands are negatively correlated (loop A, strands

1, 3 and loop B, strand 1), with the remaining eleven all ex-
hibiting strong positive Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. This
indicates that as the structures broaden, peak intensities in-
crease for open fan loops and their sub-element strands.

As for the magnetically closed structures, three of the four
loops (D, F, and G) are positively correlated whilst loop H
is negatively correlated. All four loops have modest Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient magnitudes that are weaker than all the
open fan loops bar loop A. Peculiarly, all the Pearson coefﬁ-
cients bar one of the sub-element strands are positively cor-
related for the magnetically closed structures despite the fact
that loop H is negatively correlated. The other strand (loop
G, strand 3), whilst having a negative Pearson coefﬁcient, the

absolute magnitude is such that the strand exhibits no linear
correlation and thus is considered to be uncorrelated.

Focusing on loop H, the loop width broadens as one trav-
els along loop position (Figure 3 bottom) whilst the peak in-
tensity of the cross-sectional slices decreases (Figure 3 H1 –
H16). Thus, there should be a negative correlation between
the intensity and width for the loop. If we now consider the
sub-element strands, such as strand 2 say, it can be seen that
as the peak intensity ﬂuctuates, the FWHM remains rela-
tively constant along the analysed segment whilst the spac-
ing between strands 1 and 2 (2 and 3) increases (decreases)
(Figure 4) as the loop expands, i.e.
the strands spread out
(overlap more) along the integrated line-of-sight. All these

10

WILLIAMS, WALSH, AND MORGAN (2021)

factors together may explain a weak positive Pearson corre-
lation coefﬁcient for the strands of loop H despite the loop
being negatively correlated.

As is noted in Klimchuk & DeForest (2020), if a loop or
strand were to be non-circular (such as an oval) and twisted,
there would be an inverse relationship between the intensity
and width. That is, the loop would have a higher (lower)
peak intensity at narrower (broader) loop widths if relatively
constant density and temperature are assumed. The major-
ity of our results for open fan and closed loops, along with
Klimchuk & DeForest (2020), and nine of the thirteen struc-
tures analysed by McCarthy et al. (2021) indicate that the re-
lationship between intensity and width may be positively cor-
related and thus their cross sections are approximately circu-
lar. However, it is worth noting that one magnetically closed
loop, and three open fan strands of this study along with four
loops analysed by McCarthy et al. (2021) do support the idea
that some loops and sub-element strands may be non-circular.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Employing the analysis methods of Williams et al. (2020a,b),

this article investigates the relationship between width and
peak intensity of eight relatively isolated coronal loops
and extends this for the ﬁrst time to sub-element strands
within the Hi-C 2.1 data. These loops and strands are traced
along segments 10 – 30 Mm in length, which are of com-
parable length to the loops analysed with the data from
the ﬁrst Hi-C mission (Klimchuk & DeForest 2020) but are
some 20 – 50 Mm shorter than those in the recent study by
McCarthy et al. (2021).

The population of the eight loops analysed is evenly split
between open fan (loops A, B, C, and E) and magnetically
closed (loops D, F, G, and H) structures and are thus treated
independently from each other in our width expansion analy-
sis. The segments analysed for loops B and E reside near the
visible footpoints (Figure 1) of the open fan structures and
thus undergo signiﬁcant expansion whereby their widths in-
crease an additional 80 % and 150 % (see Total Expansion,
Table 1) of their initial value. Conversely, the segments anal-
ysed for loops A and C (Figures 6 and 7) show minimal width
variation along their length. These results suggest that open
fan loops may expand rapidly near their footpoints and af-
ter which their cross-sectional width may remain relatively
constant. With that said, a more comprehensive data-set is
required from future high resolution missions to conﬁrm this
as current and archival data lack the resolving power to accu-
rately quantify the expansion seen with Hi-C 2.1.

As with previous loop width studies (Klimchuk et al. 1992;
Klimchuk 2000, 2015; L´opez Fuentez & Klimchuk 2006),
the magnetically closed structures analysed in this article ex-
hibit little expansion with three of the four loops showing
< 6 % (108 km; < 1.2 Hi-C 2.1 pixels) expansion (Table 1)

along the analysed segments. Similarly, the width and sepa-
ration distance of the sub-element strands of these loops re-
main largely constant along the loop portions under consid-
eration in this study. One caveat to this is that loop D can be
seen to expand and contract periodically.

As discussed by Klimchuk & DeForest (2020), the largest
error in coronal loop width analysis is a direct result of per-
forming background subtraction due to the relative magni-
tudes of the loop and line-of-sight emission that is removed.
Close inspection of the FOV image (Figure 1) reveals mul-
tiple structures intersecting/crossing loop D, which makes it
more difﬁcult to employ a consistent background removal
along the loop segment. As such, these variations in loop
width are likely to be the caused by background subtraction
due to the crossing of multiple structures along the line-
of-sight rather than because the loop is a twisted structure
of non-circular cross-section (Malanushenko & Schrijver
2013).

Generalising the data-set as a whole, the expansion of
loops can be quantiﬁed by the sub-element strands broad-
ening and separating from each other simultaneously along
the segments considered which leads to the increasing cross-
sectional loop widths seen in loops B and E. Similarly, the
lack of expansion seen in the other six structures is caused by
strands whose widths and separation remain relatively con-
stant along the loop segments analysed.

≈

Upon exploring the relationship between loop width and
this article ﬁnds that seven of the eight
peak intensity,
loops analysed (
88 %) are positively correlated, with the
other loop being negatively correlated. These results match
previous ﬁndings (West et al. 2014; Kucera et al. 2019;
Klimchuk & DeForest 2020) with Klimchuk & DeForest
(2020) being a notable comparison due to their work also
examining loops of similar lengths to the ones in this study
with Hi-C, albeit with the 193 ˚A data-set. As such, our re-
sults support the Klimchuk & DeForest (2020) hypothesis
that loops are more likely to exhibit circular cross sections
rather than elliptical ones (Malanushenko & Schrijver 2013;
McCarthy et al. 2021), which would be the case if the peak
intensities and widths of the cross sectional slices were neg-
atively correlated. As for the coronal strands, we obtain a
similar outcome with 20 strands (80 %) showing positive
correlation, 3 strands (12 %) showing negative correlation
and 2 strands (8 %) being uncorrelated.

The ﬁndings presented in this article for magnetically
closed coronal loops and their sub-element strands sup-
port the discussion of Klimchuk (2000) and Williams et al.
(2020a,b) in regards to coronal heating. That is, whatever
mechanism is responsible for the coronal heating, theoreti-
cal models may need to reproduce monolithic strands whose
cross-sections (i) have widths at the same order of an AIA
435 km), and (ii) are approximately circular along
pixel (

their length. These implications for coronal heating are con-
tingent on coronal loops being compact structures that are
subjected to twist.
In particular, ﬁtting multiple nearly-
cylindrical Gaussian-shaped strands relies heavily on the
assumption that curvilinear features in the Hi-C 2.1 image
plane do indeed correspond to compact structures in three
dimensions. Whilst this assumption is plausible, other expla-
nations may be equally valid in explaining the cross-sectional
proﬁles observed. As is discussed in McCarthy et al. (2021),
monolithic loops when viewed from a single vantage point
– such as AIA or in this study Hi-C 2.1 – may in fact be
loops with non-ﬁxed aspect ratios and/or exhibit anisotropic
expansion. They may also be the result of projection effects
of complicated bright manifolds in the corona, or some other
complex density enhancement. Thus, further three dimen-
sional analysis is required to conﬁrm whether coronal loops
are possibly well represented by a collection of sub-element
strands.

As with the West et al. (2014) (11 loops), Klimchuk & DeForest

(2020) (20 loops) and McCarthy et al. (2021) (13 loops)
studies, this analysis is on a small sample size – largely
due to the difﬁculty in tracing isolated segments of coro-
nal loops within the Hi-C 2.1 data – and as suggested by
(2013) may be subject to se-
Malanushenko & Schrijver
lection bias. Further high resolution data is required, such
as from Solar Orbiter’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI;
0.1′′ pixel-1 at 0.28 AU) instrument, to explore the re-
≈
lationship between intensity and width in the hope of un-
derstanding the fundamental geometry of these important
structures in the quest for solving the coronal heating prob-
lem.

APPENDIX

A. FITTING CORONAL LOOP SUB-ELEMENTS

In this appendix, the additional ﬁgures discussed in § 3 are presented. In Figure 6, the top panels (A1 – A20) show the nor-
malised Hi-C 2.1 intensity slice (blue) and the Gaussian proﬁles (grey) that are used to generate the ﬁt (red). The cross-sectional
proﬁles are each normalised to the maximum intensity of the loop segment. The bottom panel shows the cross-sectional width
of the loop (black) and the sub-element strands (cyan, magenta, green) as a function of position along the loop segment. The
1 Hi-C 2.1 pixel whilst the error bars of the sub-element strand widths are the one - σ
error bars for the loop widths indicate
errors returned from the curve-ﬁtting method. The same plots are shown for loops C (Figure 7), D (Figure 8), E (Figure 9), F
(Figure 10), and G (Figure 11). As can be seen from these ﬁgures, magnetically closed loops, D, F, and G, and open fan loops A
and C show little variance in the cross-sectional loop width vs. length, whilst open fan loop E undergoes signiﬁcant expansion.
