Using a three-dimensional semiclassical method, we theoretically investigate frustrated double
ionization (FDI) of Ar atoms subjected to strong laser ﬁelds. The double-hump photoelectron
momentum distribution generated from FDI observed in a recent experiment [S. Larimian et al.,
Phys. Rev. Research 2, 013021 (2020)] is reproduced by our simulation. We conﬁrm that the
observed spectrum is due to recollision. The laser intensity dependence of FDI is investigated. We
reveal that the doubly excited sates of Ar atoms and excited states of Ar+ are the dominant pathways
for producing FDI at relatively low and high intensities, respectively. Our work demonstrates that
at modest intensities, FDI is a general strong-ﬁeld physical process accompanied with nonsequential
double ionization and it is an important consequence of recollision.

I.

INTRODUCTION

When exposed to a strong laser ﬁeld, the outermost
electron of atoms or molecules can be ionized through
tunneling. The electron is then accelerated and pos-
sibly driven back by the oscillating laser electric ﬁeld
to recollide with its parent ion [1], resulting in vari-
ous strong-ﬁeld phenomena such as above-threshold ion-
ization (ATI) plateau [2], high-order harmonic genera-
tion (HHG) [3, 4], and nonsequential double ionization
(NSDI) [5]. Alternatively, due to the presence of the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the ion, the electron may also be cap-
tured into an Rydberg state after the end of the laser
pulse, leading to excited atoms or molecules [6–13]. This
is known as frustrated tunneling ionization (FTI) [7].
The capture of electrons into Rydberg states was also
found when strong ﬁeld double ionization (DI) occurs
[14, 15], which can be referred to frustrated double ion-
ization (FDI). It has been mainly observed in atomic
fragments produced by Coulomb explosion of molecules
and also dimers [15–20], which can be explained as neu-
tralization during dissociative ionization process [21, 22].
Taking FDI of hydrogen molecules for example [15, 22],
two electrons tunnel ionize sequentially and one of them
may be captured by one of the protons when the molec-
ular ions fragment, leading to the formation of a highly
excited neutral hydrogen atom and a proton. Experi-
mentally, the capture process is identiﬁed by measuring
the kinetic energies of the excited neutral fragments af-
ter molecular dissociative ionization. Unfortunately, this
method is not applicable for atomic targets since atomic

∗ H.Kang@gsi.de

FDI happens without dissociation and the products are
excited ions rather than excited neutral fragments. Con-
sequently, there is a lack of experimental and theoretical
studies on atomic FDI.

Very recently, FDI of Ar atoms was experimentally
identiﬁed by measuring the dc-ﬁeld ionized electrons from
the excited singly charged ions (Ar+
∗), the photoelec-
trons, and the corresponding doubly charged ions in co-
incidence (Ar2+) [23]. The measured photoelectron mo-
mentum distributions corresponding to an FDI event dis-
play a clear transition from a double-hump to a single-
hump structure as the laser intensity is increased, quite
similar to DI. The observation suggests that the phys-
ical mechanism of FDI diﬀers for diﬀerent intensity re-
gions where NSDI or sequential double ionization (SDI)
dominate, respectively. For SDI occurring at high inten-
sities, the two electrons are ionized independently. The
narrow single-hump structure for FDI at such high inten-
sities, which has a width close to that for single ioniza-
tion, strongly suggests that the trapped electrons mainly
arise from the second ionization step. For modest intensi-
ties, where NSDI dominates, it has been speculated that
the electron-electron interaction during recollision causes
the double-hump momentum spectrum for FDI [23]. Yet,
how exactly recollision results in such a spectrum remains
unclear.

In this paper, we theoretically study FDI of Ar atoms
using a semiclassical model. The main purpose of the
current work is to oﬀer a transparent physical picture
of FDI at modest intensities where NSDI dominates. We
calculate the ratio of FDI to single ionization (SI) and the
ratio of FDI to DI as functions of laser intensity. Our cal-
culation reproduces the experimental double-hump pho-
toelectron momentum distribution of FDI as reported in

 
 
 
 
 
 
[23]. We conﬁrm that recollision is responsible for this
structure and further show that how recollision leads to
diﬀerent photoelectron momentum distributions for FDI
at diﬀerent intensities. By analyzing the electron tra-
jectories, we ﬁnd that the dominant pathways for FDI
at relatively low and high intensities are doubly excited
states of Ar and excited states of Ar+, respectively. This
work indicates that FDI is a general strong-ﬁeld process
accompanied with NSDI and it is another important con-
sequence of recollision.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we intro-
duce the semiclassical model. Section III shows our main
results. Finally, we present our conclusion in Sec. IV.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

A well-established three-dimensional

semiclassical
model (see, e.g., [24, 25]) is employed to describe FDI
and NSDI. In this model, we consider the interaction of
a two-active-electron atom with a linearly polarized laser
ﬁeld:

tude of the laser electric ﬁeld. The pulse envelope func-
tion f (t) is a constant equal to 1 for the ﬁrst ten laser
cycles and then reduced to zero with a three-cycle ramp
in the form of cos2.

Following the same procedure as used in previous
studies [26–28], the outermost electron e1 is assumed
to be ionized by quantum tunneling through the ﬁeld-
suppressed atomic potential. The tunneling process can
be described by the Schr¨odinger equation in parabolic co-
ordinates (atomic units are used throughout this paper)

where Ip1 is the ﬁrst ionization potential of atoms. Eq.
(2) describes the tunneling process for an electron with
energy of Ip1/4 within an eﬀective potential U (η) =
Eη/8. Thus, the tunnel exit point η0 is
−
determined by solving the equation U (η) = Ip1/4. The
corresponding initial positions of e1 are x0 = y0 = 0,
z0 =
η0/2. The initial longitudinal velocity is assumed
to be zero and a nonzero initial velocity perpendicular to
the laser polarization direction is introduced [30]. The
corresponding initial velocities are thus vx0 = v
cos θ,
sin θ, and vz0 = 0, where θ is the angle be-
vy0 = v
tween the transverse velocity v
and the x-axis. For the
bound electron e2, its initial conditions are determined
by assuming this electron in the ground state of singly
charged ions and the corresponding positions and mo-
menta are depicted by a microcanonical distribution [31].

As shown in Fig. 1(a), diﬀerent groups of electron tra-
jectories can be identiﬁed, depending on the ﬁnal energies
of the two electrons. Here we choose Ar as the target.
DI events are identiﬁed when the ﬁnal energies of both
electrons are larger than zero. FDI events are identiﬁed
when one electron has positive ﬁnal energy and the other
is captured into highly excited Rydberg states Ar+

the end of the laser pulse. Depending on which electron
is recaptured, FDI events can be distinguished into FDI1

Figure 2(a) shows the calculated ratio of FDI to SI
and the ratio of DI to SI as functions of laser inten-
sity. The intensity-dependent ratio of DI to SI ex-
hibits a pronounced knee structure, which is a charac-
teristic feature of NSDI [34–38].
Interestingly, the ra-
tio of FDI to SI shows a similar dependence on the in-
tensity. The intensity-dependent ratio of FDI to DI is
shown in Fig. 2(b). For comparison, we also calculate
FTI events, which are identiﬁed when Ee1,ﬁnal < 0 and
Ip2, where Ip2 is the second ionization poten-
Ee2,ﬁnal =
tial of Ar. We ﬁnd that both the calculated ratios of FTI
to SI and FDI to DI decrease with the increase of inten-
sity. Most FTI events are contributed by directly ionized
trajectories rather than recollision trajectories because
recollision tends to increase the drift momentum of e1
[8, 39]. As the intensity is increased, the directly ionized
e1 obtains larger momentum and the distance between
e1 and the ionic core becomes larger. Correspondingly,
its kinetic energy becomes larger and the Coulomb at-
traction between e1 and the core becomes weaker. As a
result, it is harder for e1 to be captured and the ratio of
FTI to SI decreases as the intensity is increased. In our

in our calculation. When the intensity is increased, the
returning energy of e1 becomes larger and both the ener-
gies of e1 and e2 right after recollision thus become larger.
Hence, it is harder for any one of the two electrons to be
captured at the end of the laser pulse and the ratio of
FDI to DI decreases.

1013 W/cm2 and 3.1

In order to understand the dependence of FDI on in-
tensity, we investigate the energy distributions of the two
1014 W/cm2, re-
electrons at 4
spectively. Figures 3(a)-3(c) display the electron-electron
energy distributions of both DI and FDI events around
the recollision time (denoted as tr) when the two elec-
1013 W/cm2. Right
trons are closest to each other for 4
before tr, the returning energy of e1 has a cutoﬀ of 0.33
a.u., which is slightly larger than 3.17Up (Up is the pon-
deromotive energy) due to the existence of the tunneling
exit and the Coulomb potential. The energy of e2 is
around -1.02 a.u. (
Ip2). At tr, e1 transfers some en-
ergy to e2. We ﬁnd that doubly excited states (DESs) of
Ar are largely populated shortly after tr and the binding
energy of e1 is close to that of e2 [Fig. 3(c)], which is
consistent with previous studies of NSDI [40]. As e1 and
e2 share the energy evenly during recollision and experi-
ence the same laser electric ﬁeld afterwards, one would
expect no preference for each electron with higher ﬁnal
energy than the other one. Hence, the probabilities of
FDI1 and FDI2 are close to each other, as shown in Fig.
2(c).

−

As seen in Fig. 4(a), the energy of e1 shortly after rec-
ollision is larger than zero for most DI and FDI events
1014 W/cm2, which indicates that the DESs are
at 3.1
no longer the main pathways for producing DI and FDI

NSDI of Ar proceeds mainly via recollision impact ion-
ization (RII) [41]. Despite the formation of Ar+
∗, the
excited electron e2 is ionized quickly after recollision. It
has been recently shown that, both theoretically [28] and
experimentally [42], there exists a time delay lasting for
a small fraction of T between tr and double ionization
time for RII. Here we show that a signiﬁcant time de-
lay between tr and t′ occurs for both FDI and DI events
[Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)], where t′ is the instant when both
the energies of e1 and e2 are larger than zero for the ﬁrst
time for FDI events [see Fig. 1(b)] and the double ion-
ization time for DI events. In accordance with Ref. [28],
the time delay distribution shows three pronounced peaks
for DI events [Fig. 5(b)]. As for FDI events, our calcu-
lation reveals ﬁve pronounced peaks, denoted as P1
P5
in Fig. 5(a).
In the following, we will show that this
time delay distribution is the key to understand the ra-
tio of FDI1(FDI2) to FDI at high intensities shown in
Fig. 2(c).

∼

Firstly, we discuss the mechanism of FDI events corre-
sponding to the ﬁrst peak (P1) in Fig. 5(a). The sum en-
Ip2,
ergy of the two electrons right after recollision is Er1 −
where Er1 is the returning energy of e1. We have found
that the energy of e2 right after recollision is close to zero

electrons can thus be expressed as

respectively, where pr(tr) is the residual momentum of
e1 right after recollision and pd is the drift momentum
obtained from the laser ﬁeld subsequently. In Fig. 5(c)
we show the probability distribution of tr for P1 and cor-
responding distribution of the sum of pr(tr) and pd(tr),
predicted by the simple-man theory [43]. One can ﬁnd
that tr is mainly distributed from 0.5T to 0.75T where
the sum of pr(tr) and pd(tr) is close to zero, indicating
that pr(tr) is cancelled out by pd(tr). According to Eq.
(6), Ee1,ﬁnal is thus close to zero. As shown in Fig. 5(d),
the probability distribution of t′ is similar to that of tr
and the vector potential A(t′) is nonzero for most tra-
jectories. Consequently, for P1, e1 is more likely to be
captured after the end of the laser pulse, leading to FDI1.
P5 in Fig.
5(a), the energy of e1 is larger than zero while the energy
of e2 is slightly smaller than zero right after tr, which is
similar to Fig. 4(a). As shown in Fig. 5(e), pr(tr) and
pd(tr) do not cancel each other out for multiple returning
trajectories, which contribute to FDI signiﬁcantly. Con-
sequently, the ﬁnal energy of e1 can be quite large for
most FDI events. As for e2, it stays in the excited state
of Ar+ until t′. Figure 5(f) displays the corresponding
probability distribution of t′. One can ﬁnd that the dis-
tribution peaks around n+1
2 T (n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) where the
vector potential A(t′) is close to zero. This is diﬀerent
from the case for P1. Therefore, e2 tends to be captured
after the end of the laser pulse [Eq. (7)], leading to FDI2.
Due to much more contribution of P2
P5 as compared
with P1 [Fig. 5(a)], the probability of FDI2 is larger than
that of FDI1, as shown in Fig. 2(c).

To compare with the experiment, we further calcu-
late the photoelectron momentum distribution for FDI
1014 W/cm2. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the pho-
at 3.1
toelectron momentum distribution for FDI1 displays a
double-hump structure. For the calculation of FDI2, two
additional “shoulders” around pz =
2 a.u. can be seen.
For FDI2, the photoelectron (e1) has the ﬁnal momentum
approximately equal to pr(tr) + pd(tr), which is close to
zero for the ﬁrst-return-collision trajectories [Fig. 5(e)],
leading to the shallow dip around pz = 0 a.u. shown in
Fig. 6(a). The sum of pr(tr) and pd(tr) is much larger for
even-order-return-collision trajectories [Fig. 5(e)], lead-
2 a.u.
ing to the shoulder-like structures around pz =
For FDI1, e1 is captured at the end of the laser pulse.
The momentum of e2 right after recollision is close to
zero. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the distribution of t′ peaks

Figure 6(b) compares the calculated photoelectron mo-
mentum distribution for FDI (the sum of FDI1 and FDI2)
and the experimental result in Ref. [23]. The calculation
is in good agreement with the experiment, conﬁrming
above analysis based on the recollision picture. The cal-
culated probabilities for
> 2 a.u. are higher than
pz
|
the experiment. This can be partially attributed to the
intensity volume eﬀect in the experiment, which is not
included in our calculation.

|

Finally, we show the calculated photoelectron momen-
tum distributions for FDI at diﬀerent intensities in Fig.
7. The intensity dependence can be understood as fol-
lows. For FDI2 events, with the decrease of the intensity,
pr(tr) becomes smaller than pd(tr) so that the ﬁnal mo-
menta of the photoelectrons (e1) are no longer close to
zero. This suppresses the FDI2 events around pz = 0
a.u. As a result, the dip of the electron momentum dis-
tribution for FDI becomes more pronounced. When the
intensity is further decreased to the regime where the
DESs of Ar are the dominant pathways leading to FDI
1013 W/cm2), the two electrons stay in the DESs
(I
for a while and one of them is then ionized around the
maximum of the laser ﬁeld where the vector potential is
close to zero. Therefore, the ﬁnal momenta of the pho-
toelectrons peak around zero, leading to a single-hump
distribution with a much narrower width. The predicted
intensity-dependent photoelectron momentum distribu-
tions can be testiﬁed by further experiments.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we theoretically investigate intensity de-
pendence of FDI process of Ar atoms. The calculated
ratio of FDI to SI as a function of intensity shows a pro-
nounced knee structure and the ratio of FDI to DI de-

single-hump structure. For the relatively high intensity
regime, the excited states of Ar+ are the dominant path-
ways leading to FDI. The probability of FDI2 is signif-
icantly higher than that of FDI1 and the photoelectron
momentum distribution exhibits the double-hump struc-
ture, which is in good agreement with the recent exper-
imental result [23]. Our work conﬁrms that this obser-
vation is due to recollision and explains that how recolli-
sion results in diﬀerent photoelectron momentum distri-
butions for diﬀerent intensities. This work demonstrates
that FDI generally exists as a companion with strong-
ﬁeld NSDI process and oﬀers intuitive physical insights
into FDI of atoms.
