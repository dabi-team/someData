ABSTRACT

We establish the largest eruptive/conﬁned ﬂare database to date and ana-
lyze 322 ﬂares of GOES class M1.0 and larger that occurred during 2010−2019,
i.e., almost spanning the entire solar cycle 24. We ﬁnd that the total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR) of active regions (ARs) is a key parameter in governing the
eruptive character of large ﬂares, with the proportion of eruptive ﬂares exhibit-
ing a strong anti-correlation with ΦAR. This means that an AR containing a
large magnetic ﬂux has a lower probability for the large ﬂares it produces to be
associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME). This ﬁnding is supported by the
high positive correlation we obtained between the critical decay index height and
ΦAR, implying that ARs with a larger ΦAR have a stronger magnetic conﬁnement.
Moreover, the conﬁned ﬂares originating from ARs larger than 1.0×1023 Mx have
several characteristics in common: stable ﬁlament, slipping magnetic reconnec-
tion and strongly sheared post-ﬂare loops. Our ﬁndings reveal new relations
between the magnetic ﬂux of ARs and the occurrence of CMEs in association
with large ﬂares. These relations obtained here provide quantitative criteria for
forecasting CMEs and adverse space weather, and have also important implica-
tions for “superﬂares” on solar-type stars and stellar CMEs. The link of database

Introduction

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most energetic phenomena in our
solar system and are the dominant contributors to adverse space weather at Earth (Gosling
et al. 1991; Green et al. 2018). They originate from the rapid release of free magnetic energy
stored in the sheared or twisted magnetic ﬁelds of active regions (ARs) through magnetic
reconnection (Forbes 2000; Shibata & Magara 2011). Magnetic reconnection is believed to
be a fundamental process in magnetized plasma systems throughout the Universe where
magnetic energy is stored over relatively long times to be released suddenly in bursts of
various forms (thermal, kinetic, and high-energy particle) (Priest & Forbes 2000; Su et al.
2013). Flares associated with a CME are usually referred to as eruptive events, while ﬂares
that are not accompanied by a CME are called conﬁned or “CME-less” events (Svestka 1986;
Moore et al. 2001). The association rate of ﬂares and CMEs has revealed that most small
ﬂares occur without a CME, whereas for large ﬂares (M-class, X-class) the CME-association
is steeply increasing, and reaches 100% for the biggest events (Andrews 2003; Yashiro et
al. 2006). The broad variety of strong space weather eﬀects is mostly due to the CME
rather than the ﬂare itself. Our understanding of the physical mechanism of ﬂares and their
relationship with CMEs is important to forecast space weather in the near-Earth environment
(Forbes 2000; Shibata & Magara 2011). Meanwhile, the solar ﬂare-CME paradigm might
be applied to magnetic activities in other stars, which is vital for the question of exoplanet
habitability and the evolution of stellar mass loss and rotation (Khodachenko et al. 2007;
Lammer et al. 2007).

Substantial observational studies have revealed that a ﬂare would be conﬁned if the
strapping magnetic ﬁeld overlying the ﬂaring region is too strong or does not decrease suﬃ-
ciently fast with height (Green et al. 2002; Wang & Zhang 2007; Cheng et al. 2011; Yang et
al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015; Thalmann et al. 2015). To quantify the decline of the strapping
ﬁeld with height, the decay index has been used (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Fan & Gibson 2007;
Zuccarello et al. 2015), i.e., n=–d lnBhor/d lnh, with Bhor denoting the horizontal ﬁeld and h
the height in the corona. The torus instability of a magnetic ﬂux rope occurs when the decay
index n reaches a critical value ncrit≈1.5 (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Fan & Gibson 2007). Re-
cent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations showed that the overlying ﬁeld lines form
a conﬁning cage and a weaker magnetic cage would produce a more energetic eruption with

– 3 –

a CME (Amari et al. 2018). Another important factor that governs the eruptive character
of solar ﬂares is the non-potentiality of ARs. Statistical studies have shown that ﬂare and
CME productivity are correlated with magnetic shear, electric current, magnetic free energy,
etc (Hagyard & Rabin 1986; Falconer et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2016a). It is suggested that AR
eruptivity is related to the relative value of magnetic non-potentiality over the restriction of
the background ﬁeld (Sun et al. 2015).

In this paper, we derive important quantitative relations between the magnetic prop-
erties of ARs and the eruptive character of large solar ﬂares, based on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) observations during the period of solar cycle 24. A
total of 322 ﬂares (170 eruptive and 152 conﬁned) of Geostationary Operational Environ-
mental Satellite (GOES ) class M1.0 and larger that occurred within 45◦ from the central
meridian, from June 2010 until June 2019, are selected. About 51% (155 of 301) of the
M-class ﬂares are eruptive and the percentage increases up to ∼71% (15 of 21) for X-class
ﬂares, similar to the previous results (Yashiro et al. 2006). To our knowledge, the erup-
tive/conﬁned ﬂare sample established in this study is by far the largest one in the era of
SDO. We show that total unsigned magnetic ﬂux of ARs (ΦAR) is a decisive parameter in
governing the eruptive character of ﬂares, and the proportion of eruptive ﬂares exhibits a
strong anti-correlation with ΦAR. This ﬁnding is further supported by the high correlation
obtained between ΦAR and the critical height for torus instability.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In Sections 2 and 3, we describe the
data analysis and show the statistical results, respectively. Section 4 presents the detailed
analysis for six events as typical examples. Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss
the implications in Section 5.

2. Data Analysis

2.1. Event Sample

The SDO satellite has already provided a rich database since its launch in February 2010.
Until now, its observation period lasts about 10 years and almost spans the entire solar cycle
24. Thus it is a good opportunity to carry out statistical analysis about the ﬂare-CME
mechanism based on the SDO observations. Firstly, we examined a database RibbonDB
presented by Kazachenko et al. (2017) and selected all 302 ﬂare events larger than M1.0
that occurred within 45◦ from the central meridian, from June 2010 until April 2016. To
extend the time period, we checked for the GOES soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂare catalog to search
for ﬂare events from May 2016 to June 2019 and found 20 ﬂares of GOES class M1.0 and

– 4 –

greater. A total of 322 ﬂare events are involved in our database over a nine-year period (see
Table FlareM1.0). Secondly, for each ﬂare, its CME association was determined by checking
the CME catalog1 (Gopalswamy et al. 2009) of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO)/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). We regarded a ﬂare as
eruptive if the CME onset time was within 90 min of the ﬂare start time and the position angle
of the CME agreed with the quadrant on the Sun where the ﬂare occurred. Moreover, we also
inspected the observations of the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO;
Kaiser et al. 2008; Howard et al. 2008) to check from a diﬀerent viewing angle if there is an
associated CME. For the events diﬃcult to determine the classiﬁcation, e.g., there are two
ﬂares within a short time or the CME is too weak to be identiﬁed, we then checked the EUV
observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board
the SDO and identiﬁed the coronal EUV wave manually. If a global coronal EUV wave was
associated with the ﬂare, the ﬂare was classiﬁed as eruptive. Out of these 322 ﬂares, 170
(∼53%) events were eruptive (155 M- and 15 X-) and 152 (∼47%) were conﬁned (146 M-
and 6 X-).

2.2. Data and Methods

We investigated the relations between the AR parameters (unsigned AR magnetic ﬂux
ΦAR and AR area) and the eruptive character of large solar ﬂares. The AR parameters in
RibbonDB catalog (Kazachenko et al. 2017) are calculated based on the full-disk Helio-
seismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) vector magnetogram data series
(hmi.B_720s) before the ﬂare onset time. To avoid noisy magnetic ﬁelds, only pixels that
host a normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld |Bn|>100 G are considered. For the ﬂare
events that are not included in the RibbonDB catalog, we use the available vector magne-
tograms (hmi.sharp_cea_720s) from Space-Weather HMI AR Patches (Bobra et al. 2014)
before the ﬂare onset. The magnetograms were re-mapped using a cylindrical equal area
projection with a pixel size of ∼0′′.5 and presented as (Br, Bθ, Bφ) in heliocentric spherical
coordinates corresponding to (Bz, -By, Bx) in heliographic coordinates (Sun 2013). Simi-
larly, to calculate the AR magnetic ﬂux and AR area, we consider all pixels of |Br|>100
G. Moreover, RibbonDB catalog (Kazachenko et al. 2017) also includes the parameters
of ﬂare ribbons such as the ﬂare ribbon reconnection ﬂux Φribbon, the cumulative ﬂare rib-
bon area Sribbon, the ratio of the AR magnetic ﬂux involved in the ﬂare reconnection Rf lux
(Φribbon/ΦAR) and the area ratio RS (Sribbon/SAR). In this work, we also use these parameters
of 302 ﬂare events larger than M1.0 and investigate their distributions and correlations in

eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares.

The role of the background coronal ﬁelds in conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares was estimated
by calculating the decay index n above the ARs. In order to extrapolate the 3D magnetic ﬁeld
in the entire AR volume, we use the Fourier transformation method (Alissandrakis 1981) to
extrapolate the potential ﬁeld. The method yields the local potential ﬁeld with a resolution
around 0.72 Mm, same as the resolution of the boundary condition. The boundary condition
is the normal component of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld from Space-Weather HMI AR
Patches (Bobra et al. 2014) observed prior to the ﬂare start. From the extrapolated ﬁeld, the
mean value of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld, <Bhor>, as a function of height is obtained along
the main polarity inversion line (PIL) and an average decay index, <n>, is then derived.
Here, the main PIL was identiﬁed as zero Gauss contour in the bottom vertical magnetic
ﬁeld (Br) image from the extrapolated potential ﬁelds (Bokenkamp 2007; Vasantharaju et
al. 2018). To analyze the structure and dynamics of typical ﬂare examples, we used the
E(UV) observations from the AIA, with a resolution of ∼0′′.6 per pixel and a cadence of
12(24) s. Five channels of AIA 1600, 304, 171, 94 and 131 ˚A were mainly applied to analyze
the appearances of the ﬂares. The full-disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld data from the
HMI are also used to present the ARs producing the typical ﬂare examples.

3. Statistical Results

3.1. Magnetic Properties of ARs and Eruptive Character of Solar Flares

Figure 1(a) shows the scatter plot of the ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux versus ΦAR. Blue (red)
circles are the eruptive (conﬁned) ﬂares. Obviously, when ΦAR is small enough, the ﬂares
tend to be eruptive (Area A in Figure 1(a)). About 92% (36 of 39) of events occurring
in ARs with ΦAR smaller than 3.0×1022 Mx are eruptive. An overwhelming majority of
ﬂares that are hosted by ARs with a large magnetic ﬂux do not generate CMEs (Area C
in Figure 1(a)). The proportion of conﬁned ﬂares of GOES class ≥M1 is ∼93% (26 of 28)
corresponding to the AR with ΦAR larger than 1.0×1023 Mx. We examined two special
eruptive events (M4.0-class ﬂare on 24 October 2014 in Figure 10 and X1.8-class event on
20 December 2014) in Area C of Figure 1(a) and found that they either were located at the
edge of the AR or caused a sympathetic eruption of a nearby quiescent ﬁlament. If the AR
has a moderate magnetic ﬂux (larger than 3.0×1022 Mx and smaller than 1.0×1023 Mx), the
likelihood of eruptive and conﬁned events appears to be almost equal (132 eruptive ﬂares
and 126 conﬁned events of 258 in Area B of Figure 1(a)). The scatter plot of the ﬂare peak
X-ray ﬂux versus total AR area shows a similar trend (Figure 1(b)). All ﬂares in ARs with
an area smaller than 5.0×1019 cm2 are eruptive (Area A in Figure 1(b)) and all ﬂares in ARs

– 6 –

larger than 3.0×1020 cm2 are conﬁned (Area C in Figure 1(b)).

Figures 1(c)-(d) display the histograms for conﬁned and eruptive events. There are
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in distributions of AR magnetic ﬂux and AR area between the conﬁned
and eruptive cases. The conﬁned events have larger AR magnetic ﬂux and AR area. The
averages of the log values of ΦAR (indicated by vertical dotted lines) are 6.3×1022 Mx and
4.4×1022 Mx for conﬁned and eruptive cases, respectively. The log-mean values of AR
area for the conﬁned and eruptive events are 1.5×1020 cm2 and 1.2×1020 cm2, respectively.
Based on the the number distributions of AR magnetic ﬂux and AR area between the
conﬁned and eruptive cases, we display the relations of the proportions of eruptive ﬂares PE
(PE=NE/(NE+NC), NE and NC are numbers of eruptive and conﬁned events, respectively)
with ΦAR and AR area in Figures 1(e)-(f). It can be seen that PE decreases with ΦAR. The
proportion PE has a strong anti-correlation with ΦAR at the Spearman rank order correlation
coeﬃcient rs of −0.97. The Spearman rank correlation provides a measure of the monotonic
relationship between two variables. The linear ﬁtting to the scatter plot provides the relation
of

PE=(-0.75±0.06)log|ΦAR|+(17.53±1.27), (1)

where ΦAR is in units of [Mx].

Similarly, the proportion PE shows a strong anti-correlation with AR area (rs=−0.95),

and provides the relation of

PE=(-0.76±0.09)logSAR+(15.70±1.86), (2)

where SAR is in units of [cm2].

3.2. Role of the Background Coronal Fields

We investigate the role of the background coronal ﬁelds by calculating the decay index
n above the ARs. Figure 2 shows four examples including one eruptive ﬂare in Area A of
Figure 1(a) and three conﬁned ﬂares in Area C of Figure 1(a). Black asterisks denote the
<Bhor> versus h proﬁles and blue diamonds are the <n> versus h proﬁles. The error bars
mark the corresponding standard deviation. The critical height for torus instability hcrit
corresponds to the height where <n> reaches a value of 1.5 (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Fan &
Gibson 2007). Clearly, the hcrit value of AR 11305 (∼ 17 Mm) with a small magnetic ﬂux is
lower than those of three other ARs (36−60 Mm) with larger magnetic ﬂuxes, which means
that the constraining ﬁeld above AR 11305 producing an eruptive ﬂare decays more rapidly
than other ARs with conﬁned ﬂares, and therefore a perturbation in the lower corona may

– 7 –

cause the CME seed to erupt out more easily (Wang & Zhang 2007; Liu et al. 2018).

Following the procedure described above, we estimated the critical decay index heights
hcrit for 82 events (including all the events in Areas A and C of Figure 1(a) and 15 ﬂares
in Area B of Figure 1(a)). Figure 3(a) shows the scatter plot of hcrit versus ΦAR. It can be
seen that hcrit increases with ΦAR. This indicates that ARs with a larger magnetic ﬂux tend
to have stronger constraining ﬁeld. The critical decay index height has a strong correlation
with AR magnetic ﬂux at the Spearman rank order correlation coeﬃcient rs of 0.86. The
linear ﬁtting to the scatter plot provides the relation of

hcrit=(38.31±2.37)log|ΦAR|+(−834.53±53.92), (3)

where hcrit and ΦAR are in units of [Mm] and [Mx], respectively.

Using this equation, an ΦAR value of 3.0×1022 Mx yields a hcrit of ∼27 Mm (left vertical
and bottom horizontal lines in Figure 3(a)) and 1.0×1023 Mx corresponds to hcrit of about
47 Mm (right vertical and top horizontal lines in Figure 3(a)). In Figure 3(b), we plot the
ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux versus hcrit. All ﬂares ≥M1 (28 events) with a hcrit value smaller than
27 Mm are eruptive (Area A in Figure 3(b)), and about 95% (20 of 21) of events with hcrit
larger than 47 Mm are conﬁned (Area C in Figure 3(b)). The results of Figures 1 and 3
suggest that stronger strapping ﬁelds over the ARs with a larger magnetic ﬂux play the
major role in conﬁning the eruption.

3.3. Relations of Flare Reconnection Flux with Flare Peak X-Ray Flux

Figure 4 shows the scatter plots of ﬂare ribbon reconnection ﬂux and cumulative ﬂare
ribbon area versus ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux. We ﬁnd that ﬂare reconnection ﬂux Φribbon correlates
with ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux FSXR at a moderate rank order correlation coeﬃcient rs of 0.51
for all the ﬂares (Figure 4(a)). By ﬁtting the data, we obtained their empirical relationship

log|Φribbon|=(0.51±0.04)logFSXR+(24.02±0.17), (4)

where Φribbon and FSXR are in units of [Mx] and [W/m2], respectively.

The rank order correlation coeﬃcient rs for the subset of eruptive ﬂares (rs=0.58) is
larger than rs for the conﬁned ﬂares (rs=0.42). The corresponding ﬁtting parameters for the
subsets of conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares show no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

The ribbon area and ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux (Figure 4(b)) also show a moderate correlation

with a rank order correlation coeﬃcient rs of 0.58 and their relation is

logSribbon=(0.49±0.03)logFSXR+(21.12±0.14), (5)

– 8 –

where Sribbon and FSXR are in units of [cm2] and [W/m2], respectively.

Similarly, there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the ﬁtting parameters when considering

conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares separately.

3.4. Flare Reconnection Flux Ratio and Area Ratio in Conﬁned and Eruptive

Flares

In Figures 5(a)-(b), we display the histograms of ﬂare reconnection ﬂux ratio Rf lux
(Φribbon/ΦAR) and ribbon area ratio RS (Sribbon/SAR) for conﬁned and eruptive events. It
can be seen that the distributions of both Rf lux and RS show evident diﬀerences, with Rf lux
and RS for conﬁned events smaller than those for eruptive ﬂares. Rf lux ranges between
1% and 41% for eruptive ﬂares and ranges between 1% and 21% for conﬁned events. The
proportion of eruptive ﬂares reaches ∼89% (39 of 44) corresponding to the ﬂux ratio Rf lux
higher than 15%. The log averages of ﬂux ratio Rf lux are 6.3% for conﬁned and 9.5% for
eruptive events. Similarly, the conﬁned ﬂares have the smaller area ratio RS (1%−18%) than
eruptive events (1%−30%). The log-mean values of area ratio RS are 4.0% for conﬁned and
6.1% for eruptive cases.

4. Appearances of Typical Flare Examples

4.1. Two Conﬁned Flares Within ARs of Large Magnetic Flux

We investigate the dynamic evolution of conﬁned ﬂares originating from ARs with a
large magnetic ﬂux (≥ 1.0×1023 Mx), including 26 events from 5 diﬀerent ARs (ARs 11339,
11520, 11967, 12192 and 12242). After examining the AIA observations of these conﬁned
ﬂares, we ﬁnd that they have common characteristics: slipping reconnection, strong shear,
and a stable ﬁlament. Here, two conﬁned events from ARs 11520 and 12242 are taken as
examples to analyze the ﬂare dynamics and magnetic topological structures in detail.

On 10 July 2012, a conﬁned M1.7 ﬂare occurred in the sigmoidal region of AR 11520
with ΦAR of 1.24×1023 Mx. The ﬂare was initiated at 04:58 UT and the GOES SXR ﬂux
peaked at 05:14 UT. Before the ﬂare started, a ﬁlament was located along the PIL at the
ﬂaring region (left panel in Figure 6(a)). It did not show any rise process during the ﬂare
and was stably present after the ﬂare (right panel in Figure 6(a)). The comparison of the 304
˚A image with the HMI LOS magnetogram showed that the ﬂare consisted of two positive-
polarity ribbons PR1-PR2 and two negative-polarity ribbons NR1-NR2 (middle panel in

– 9 –

Figure 6(a)). Ribbons PR1 and NR1 were located at two ends of the ﬁlament and PR2 and
NR2 at both sides of the main body (axis) of the ﬁlament. High-temperature ﬂare loops at
94 ˚A displayed notable dynamic evolution (Figure 6(b)). To display the ﬁne structures of the
EUV images, the 94 ˚A ﬁlter channel data have been processed using the multi-scale Gaussian
normalization (MGN) method (Morgan & Druckm¨uller 2014). At the start of the ﬂare, two
sets of loop bundles L1 (connecting PR2-NR1) and L2 (connecting PR1-NR2) overlying the
stable ﬁlament became bright. Starting from about 05:10 UT, a group of brightened short
loops L3 were formed connecting PR2 and NR2, and meanwhile another longer loop bundles
L4 linking PR1-NR1 can be discerned. During the ﬂare, the north parts of loop bundles
L2 and L3 exhibited apparent bidirectional slipping motions along ribbon NR2. Finally,
strongly sheared post-ﬂare loops (PFLs) appeared above the non-eruptive ﬁlament. Based
on the dynamic evolution of ﬂare loops and their relations with ﬂare ribbons, we suggest
that slipping magnetic reconnection (Priest & D´emoulin 1995; Aulanier et al. 2006) between
loop bundles L1 and L2 occurred and led to the formation of L3 and L4. We estimated the
inclination angles θ of PFLs with respect to the PIL, corresponding to the angle between
the tangents of the PFL and PIL at their intersection (left panel in Figure 6(c)). The
complementary angle of θ has been referred to as the shear angle in previous studies (Su et
al. 2007; Aulanier et al. 2012). We derive small θ values, ranging from 10◦ to 30◦, indicative
of a high non-potentiality in the form of a strong shear. Then more high-temperature PFLs
gradually cooled down and formed PFLs overlying the stable ﬁlament at 171 ˚A (Figure 6(c)).

Using the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld observed by SDO/HMI at 04:24 UT, we
make a nonlinear force-free (NLFFF) extrapolation by applying the optimization method
(Wheatland et al. 2000; Wiegelmann 2004) and obtain the 3D coronal magnetic ﬁelds.
There are two sets of sheared magnetic systems (MS1 and MS2 in Figure 7(a)) overlying
a twisted ﬂux rope (FR) prior to the ﬂare onset. By comparing the AIA observations
with the extrapolation results, we suggest that the two magnetic systems MS1 and MS2
approximately correspond to two sets of loop bundles L1 and L2 (Figure 6(b)) and the ﬂux
rope FR bears a good resemblance to the observed non-eruptive ﬁlament (Figure 6(a)). Based
on the extrapolated 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld, we calculated the squashing factor Q (Liu
et al. 2016b) which deﬁnes the locations of the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) (D´emoulin
et al. 1996; Titov et al. 2002). As seen from the distribution of Q (Figure 7(b)), the
observed ﬂare ribbons are roughly matching the locations of high Q values, implying that
magnetic reconnection involved in the ﬂare probably occurs in regions of very strong magnetic
connectivity gradients, i.e., QSLs.

Figure 8 shows another conﬁned M1.3-class ﬂare on 19 December 2014 in AR 12242,
which has a large ΦAR of ∼ 1.11×1023 Mx. The ﬂare was initiated at 09:31 UT and peaked
at 09:44 UT. It occurred at the northwest of AR 12242 and a ﬁlament was present along

– 10 –

the PIL at the ﬂaring region (Figure 8(a)). During the ﬂare process, the mainbody of the
ﬁlament did not show any rise phase except for the mild activation at its south part. After
the ﬂare, the ﬁlament remained stabilized, similar to the ﬁlament in the conﬁned M1.7-class
ﬂare in AR 11520 (Figure 6(a)). Two quasi-parallel ﬂare ribbons were distinguished from
AIA 304 ˚A images, including ribbon PR in the leading positive-polarity sunspot and the
negative-polarity ribbon NR. As shown from the high-temperature 131 ˚A observations, the
ﬂare loops were composed of two sets of magnetic systems S1 and S2 overlying the non-
eruptive ﬁlament, displaying a clear “X-shape” structure (Figure 8(b)). The south ends of
systems S1 and S2 were anchored in ribbon PR and their north ends in ribbon NR. During
the ﬂare evolution, S1 and S2 exhibited apparent slipping motions along ribbons PR and
In the gradual phase of the ﬂare, low-
NR, and more ﬂare loops successively appeared.
temperature PFLs were formed as best observed in the AIA 171 ˚A channel (Figure 8(c)).
Similarly, the early formed PFLs also displayed an “X-shape” structure. We estimated the
inclination angles θ of PFLs with respect to the PIL and found θ values in the range of
20◦−28◦. The small θ values imply that the PFLs are strongly sheared and have a higher
non-potentiality.

The apparent slipping motions of the ﬁne structures within ﬂare ribbons are further
displayed in Figure 9. Ribbon PR was composed of numerous bright dot-like substructures,
corresponding to the footpoints of high-temperature ﬂare loops. These substructures exhib-
ited apparent slipping motions in opposite directions (Figure 9(a)). We followed the trails of
3 diﬀerent substructures within ribbon PR. From 09:33:10 UT, the bright knot “1” slipped
toward the east with a displacement of about 3.8 Mm in 110 s (with a velocity of ∼30 km
s−1). Meanwhile, another bright knot “2” displayed a rapid slipping motion in the opposite
direction at a velocity of ∼130 km s−1. At 09:34:58 UT, the bright knot “3” at the middle
part of PR underwent a fast slippage towards the northeast. In order to analyze the slipping
motions of the substructures, we create a stack plot (Figure 9(c)) along slice “C-D” in the
AIA 131 ˚A images (blue curve in Figure 9(a)). As seen from the stack plot, the slipping
motions along ribbon PR were in both directions with speeds of 20−150 km s−1. Figure
9(b) shows the stack plot of the other ribbon NR along slice “A-B” (green dash-dotted curve
in Figure 8(b)). Similarly, the slippage along ribbon NR was bi-directional with apparent
speeds of 20−30 km s−1, smaller than those of ribbon PR.

4.2. One Special Eruptive Event Within an AR of Large Magnetic Flux

A large majority of ﬂares (26 of 28 events) originating from ARs of ΦAR ≥ 1.0×1023
Mx are conﬁned, however there are two special eruptive ﬂares among the 28 events. One

– 11 –

event is M4.0 ﬂare on 24 October 2014 and the other is X1.8 event on 20 December 2014.
The X1.8 ﬂare caused a sympathetic eruption of a nearby quiescent ﬁlament and generated
a CME. Figure 10 displays the appearance of the eruptive M4.0 ﬂare on 24 October 2014.
The ﬂare was initiated at 07:37 UT and peaked at 07:48 UT. It was located at the southeast
of AR 12192, far away from the main PIL of the AR. The ﬂare was triggered by a blow-out
jet as seen in AIA 304 and 131 ˚A images, and produced a CME at 08:12 UT observed by
LASCO/C2. It was suggested that the eruptive ﬂare on the southern border of the AR was
close to neighboring open ﬁeld regions (Thalmann et al. 2015) and thus the jet successfully
escaped from the solar surface and formed a CME.

4.3. One Eruptive Flare Within an AR of Small Magnetic Flux

About 92% events occurring in ARs with ΦAR smaller than 3.0×1022 Mx are eruptive.
Here, we present an eruptive M3.9 event on 02 October 2011 as an example (Figure 11).
The ﬂare originated from AR 11305 (N09◦, W12◦) with a smaller ΦAR of ∼ 1.67×1022. It
started at 00:37 UT and reached its peak at 00:50 UT. A high-temperature ﬂux rope erupted
towards the southwest in 131 ˚A image. The angle of separation between SDO and STEREO
B on 02 Oct 2011 was around 97◦. An erupting CME bubble can be observed at the west
limb in STEREO B /EUVI 195 ˚A image. Starting from about 01:05 UT, an Earth-directed
CME was observed by the COR1 coronagraph aboard STEREO B.

4.4. One Eruptive and One Conﬁned Flares Within the same AR of Medium

Magnetic Flux

When ΦAR is between 3.0×1022 and 1.0×1023 Mx, almost one half of ﬂares are conﬁned.
Here, we show two examples from the same AR 11429 on 06 March 2012. At 07:52 UT, an
eruptive M1.0-class ﬂare occurred in AR 11429 with ΦAR of about 6.78×1022 Mx measured
before the ﬂare onset (Figure 12). A reverse-S shaped ﬁlament was located along the PIL.
During the ﬂare, the middle part of the ﬁlament erupted and caused a CME. The AR was
emerging persistently and the magnetic ﬂux increased to ∼ 7.96×1022 Mx at 12:00 UT. Then
another conﬁned M2.1-class ﬂare occurred at 12:23 UT and peaked at 12:41 UT (Figure 13).
The ﬁlament in the AR did not erupt except for the activation at the north part. A ﬂux
rope was illuminated and started to rise at 12:26 UT as observed in 131 ˚A images. The rise
lasted for about 10 min and ceased at 12:37 UT. Then the ﬂux rope seemed to stay at a
certain height and faded away gradually. The eruption of the ﬂux rope failed and did not
generate any CME.

5. Summary and Discussion

In this work, we established the extensive database of eruptive/conﬁned large ﬂares in
the SDO era (a total of 322 events including 170 eruptive and 152 conﬁned cases). The mor-
phological properties of ﬂaring ARs and the ﬂare ribbons, and their statistical relationships
have been investigated. Our study delivered the following main results.

1. We ﬁnd that the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux ΦAR of ARs plays an important role
in governing the eruptive character of ﬂares, and the proportion of eruptive ﬂares exhibits a
strong anti-correlation with ΦAR (rs=-0.97). About 93% ﬂares originating from ARs with an
unsigned magnetic ﬂux larger than 1.0×1023 Mx are conﬁned, i.e., are not associated with a
CME. About 92% events occurring in ARs with ΦAR smaller than 3.0×1022 Mx are eruptive.

2. We also ﬁnd a very high positive correlation (rs=0.86) empirical relation between
critical decay index height hcrit and ΦAR. This implies that ARs with a large magnetic ﬂux
have a strong magnetic cage, which conﬁnes the eruption. This is the ﬁrst time that such
a fundamental relation between the total AR ﬂux and the conﬁnement properties for large
ﬂares is derived.

3. We ﬁnd that the ﬂare ribbon reconnection ﬂux and ﬂare ribbon area are correlated
with the peak X-ray ﬂux. There are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the ﬁtting parameters
when considering conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares separately. These ﬁndings are consistent with
previous studies (Veronig & Polanec 2015; Kazachenko et al. 2017; Tschernitz et al. 2018),
while the obtained correlation coeﬃcients between ﬂare reconnection ﬂux Φribbon and ﬂare
peak X-ray ﬂux FSXR are diﬀerent, probably due to diﬀerent ranges of ﬂare classes in diﬀerent
statistical studies.

4. The ratio of the AR magnetic ﬂux that is involved in the ﬂare reconnection process
ranges between 1% and 41% for eruptive ﬂares and between 1% and 21% for conﬁned events.
Similarly, the conﬁned ﬂares have the smaller area ratio RS (1%−18%) than eruptive events
(1%−30%).

5. By analyzing the dynamic evolution of 26 conﬁned ﬂares occurring in ARs with
ΦAR≥1.0×1023 Mx, we ﬁnd that these ﬂares have several characteristics in common: stable
ﬁlament, slipping magnetic reconnection and strongly sheared PFLs, belonging to “type I”
ﬂares as proposed in our previous work (Li et al. 2019).

Our results show that the magnetic ﬂux of ARs is a key parameter in determining
the eruptive character of large solar ﬂares, and the proportion of eruptive ﬂares exhibits a
strong anti-correlation with ΦAR. The relation was ﬁrst found in our work and has never
been revealed before. This means that the association rate of ﬂares and CMEs is decreasing

– 13 –

with the increasing magnetic ﬂux of ARs. This ﬁnding is further supported by the high
correlation obtained between ΦAR and the critical height for torus instability. The ARs
seem to be classiﬁed into three situations according to their diﬀerent magnetic properties:
strong conﬁnement (ΦAR≥1.0×1023 Mx or hcrit≥47 Mm), moderate conﬁnement (3.0×1022
<ΦAR<1.0×1023 Mx or 27<hcrit<47 Mm) and weak conﬁnement (ΦAR≤3.0×1022 Mx or
hcrit≤27 Mm). The values we use to discriminate between classes, 3.0×1022 Mx and 1.0×1023
Mx, are arbitrary. In the case of strong conﬁnement, the ﬂare energy and associated magnetic
reconﬁgurations are insuﬃcient to break through the overlying ﬁeld even if it is an X-class
ﬂare (e.g. AR 12192), thus tend to generate conﬁned ﬂares (Guo et al. 2010; Sarkar &
Srivastava 2018; Jing et al. 2018; Duan et al. 2019). On the contrary, if the constraining
eﬀect of the background ﬁeld is so small, small disturbance in the lower corona can result in
the generation of a CME, which explains the high proportion of eruptive ﬂares originating
from ARs with a small magnetic ﬂux. When the conﬁnement of overlying magnetic cage is
moderate, almost one half of ﬂares are conﬁned (Area B in Figure 1(a), also see two examples
in Figures 12-13). This indicates that the overlying conﬁnement and AR non-potentiality
(Falconer et al. 2002; Nindos & Andrews 2004) may jointly determine the class of the
ﬂare in the moderate-conﬁnement environment. Previous statistical studies have shown that
conﬁned ﬂares are often located much closer to the AR centers where the strapping ﬁeld
is higher, whereas eruptive ﬂares occur at the periphery of an AR (Wang & Zhang 2007;
Baumgartner et al. 2018).

Moreover, it is also found that the ﬂux ratio Rf lux and area ratio RS for conﬁned ﬂares
are signiﬁcantly smaller than those for eruptive events. This result is similar to the statistical
result of Toriumi et al. (2017), who showed the parameter of the ribbon area normalized
by the sunspot area determines whether a given ﬂare is eruptive or not. They suggested
that the relative structural relation between the ﬂaring region and the entire AR controls
the CME productivity.

Our ﬁndings reveal a new relation between the magnetic ﬂux of ARs and the occurrence
of CMEs in association with large ﬂares. They also have important implications for stellar
CMEs and the recently detected “superﬂares” on solar-type stars (Maehara et al. 2012;
Lynch et al. 2019). In order to produce a large ﬂare, the magnetic ﬂux of the source AR
has to be large (Aulanier et al. 2013; Shibata et al. 2013; Tschernitz et al. 2018). The
historical observational data shows that the largest magnetic ﬂux of ﬂaring ARs is up to
a few times 1023 Mx (Zhang et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2011; Schrijver et al. 2012). In the
present study, between 1% and 41% of the magnetic ﬂux of the source AR for eruptive ﬂares
and between 1% and 21% of ΦAR for conﬁned events are involved in the ﬂare reconnection
process. If we assume that the maximum percentage of 40% of the magnetic ﬂux contained
in the AR contributing to the ﬂare reconnection process (Kazachenko et al. 2017; Tschernitz

– 14 –

et al. 2018), a total reconnection ﬂux of ∼ 1.0×1023 Mx can be obtained for an AR with
ΦAR of 2.3×1023 Mx (the maximum magnetic ﬂux in our sample). According to the relation
between the ﬂare ribbon reconnection ﬂux and the peak X-ray ﬂux (Equation 4 and Figure
4), a ﬂare of GOES class ∼ X100 could be powered.

Our results are interesting in two aspects: for the solar case, as it means that for the
strongest space weather eﬀects (which are predominantly due to the CME rather than the
ﬂare), we can not simply extrapolate that the space weather eﬀects will be increasingly
stronger for ﬂares produced by large ARs present on the Sun. Second, it has implications for
the stellar case: we may speculate that in case of the much larger ARs (stellar spots) that
are needed to produce the reported “superﬂares” on solar-type stars, the ﬂares are probably
mostly conﬁned, as they will be associated with a very strong overlying AR strapping ﬁeld.
This may provide an explanation why the detection of stellar CMEs is rare (Drake et al.
2013; Odert et al. 2017; Moschou et al. 2019; Argiroﬃ et al. 2019), and implies that the
solar-stellar connection between ﬂare rates and CME rates may be fundamentally non-linear
and actually “breaking” when we come to the very large events (Drake et al. 2013; Odert et
al. 2017).

The conﬁned ﬂares from ARs with ΦAR≥1.0×1023 Mx are characterized by slipping
reconnection, strong shear, and a stable ﬁlament. They belong to “type I” conﬁned ﬂares
proposed by Li et al. (2019), who classiﬁed conﬁned ﬂares into two types based on their
diﬀerent dynamic properties and magnetic conﬁgurations. Similar to the appearance of con-
ﬁned ﬂares in AR 12192 (Li et al. 2019), the ﬁlaments in ARs 11339, 11520 (Figures 6-7),
11967 and 12242 (Figures 8-9) were all stably present and seemed not to be involved in
the ﬂare evolution. The footpoints of high-temperature ﬂare loops exhibited apparent slip-
ping motions in both directions along ﬂare ribbons (Figure 9), which implies the occurrence
of slipping magnetic reconnection overlying the non-eruptive ﬁlaments (Li & Zhang 2015;
Dud´ık et al. 2016; L¨orinˇc´ık et al. 2019; Shen et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2019). We suggest that
slipping ﬂare loops along the two directions correspond to two diﬀerent magnetic systems,
and the continuous slipping magnetic reconnection between two magnetic systems causes
the exchange of their magnetic connectivity and apparent bi-directional slipping motions of
reconnecting ﬁeld lines. Moreover, the PFLs observed in the gradual phase of the ﬂares
were strongly sheared, indicating a high non-potentiality. These observational characteris-
tics of “type I” conﬁned ﬂares are inconsistent with the 2D standard CSHKP ﬂare model
(Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), which suggests
that the reconnection is associated with the ﬁlament/ﬂux rope eruption and occurs at a
current sheet below the erupting ﬁlament. Our observations have revealed several diﬀerent
features. First, the ﬁlament/ﬂux rope seemed to be neither disturbed nor erupting during
or after the ﬂare. Second, the reconnection site is more likely along the QSLs between two

– 15 –

magnetic systems overlying non-eruptive ﬁlaments. In summary, the signatures of “type I”
conﬁned ﬂares in ARs with a large magnetic ﬂux pose a challenge to the 2D classical ﬂare
model and need to establish 3D MHD models.
