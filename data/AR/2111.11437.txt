DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS
AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS

YINGJIN BI

Abstract. In this paper, we study extension groups of modules over a preprojective algebra
using the Auslander-Reiten translation of the quiver associated with it. More precisely, based
on the recent work given by Aizenbud and Lapid, we give a description of extension groups
of a preprojective algebra in terms of the AR translation and nilpotent matrices. As a
result, we calculate the extension group of a sort of so-called determinantal modules, which
is an analogue of quantum minors in quantum coordinate rings. In particular, we give an
equivalent combinatorial condition when the product of two quantum minors (up to q-power
rescaling) belongs to the dual canonical basis of quantum coordinate rings in the Dynkin
case. More generally, we can check the quasicommuting condition for any two quantum
cluster monomials with the seeds of quantum minors.

1. Introduction

The present paper attempts to establish a bridge between the representation theory of a
Dynkin quiver Q and the modules over the corresponding preprojective algebra ΛQ using
Auslander-Reiten theory. The motivation of the paper stems from the cluster structure on
quantum coordinate rings Aq(n(w)) for an element w ∈ W in the Weyl group (see [11] for
more details). In [11] C.Geiß, B.Leclerc and J.Schr¨oer gave this quantum cluster structure
via a module category Cw on the preprojective algebra ΛQ. The key notion in their works
is a sort of so-called determinantal modules over ΛQ, this notion is an analogue of quantum
minors in Aq(n(w)). Recall that quantum minors in Aq(n(w)) belong to the dual canonical
basis B∗(w) of Aq(n(w)). Therefore, our approach can apply to some problems concerning
the dual canonical bases. In particular, this allows us to describe the quasicommuting prop-
erty of quantum cluster monomials with the seeds of quantum minors.

Before discussing the above statement, let us ﬁrst recall some well-known conjectures on
dual canonical bases. For two dual canonical bases b1 and b2 in B∗(w), there are a lot of
conjectures about their product b1b2: For instance, Leclerc proposed [19, Conjecture 1 and
Conjecture 2] or Berenstein and Zelevinsky proposed [4, Conjecture 1.7]. In this paper we
focus on the following problem:

Problem 1. For a Dynkin quiver Q, let w0 be the unique Weyl group element with maximal
length, and the reduced expression associate with it is given by the Coxeter element CQ adapted
with Q (see (2.3)). Let b1 and b2 be two dual canonical bases in B∗ of quantum coordinate
ring Aq(n(w0)) = Aq(n). We write λ1 and λ2 for the indexing of b1 and b2 respectively.
(In this paper, we just consider the Konstant partitions as the indexing set of dual canonical
bases).

Describe the condition b1b2 ∈ qZB∗ in terms of the combinatorial conditions of (λ1, λ2)
In [4], Berenstein and Zelevinsky conjecture that b1b2 ∈ qZB∗ if and only if b1b2 = qnb2b1
for some integer n. However, Leclerc gave a counter example to this conjecture, and then
proposed the notion of real dual canonical bases, e,t, b2 ∈ qZB∗ and [19, Conjecture 1 and
Conjecture 2].

Classiﬁcation of the real dual canonical bases is a diﬃcult open problem until now. The
well-known example is a sort of so-called quantum minors, which play an important role
in the cluster structure on Aq(n(w)). Recently, Lapid and Minguez [15] classify in type A
the real dual canonical bases satisfying a so-called regular condition. Even if we assume
that b1, b2 are real dual canonical bases, Problem 1 is still diﬃcult to answer (see [19]).
In [12] Kang, Kashiwara, Kim and Oh introduce the R-matrix on the category of modules

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS3

over quiver Hecke algebras (or over quantum aﬃne algebras) and then describe the condition
b1b2 ∈ qZB∗ in terms of the denominators of R-matrices. However, ﬁnding out the meaning
of this denominator is also a diﬃcult problem (see [8]).

There are some results on this problem. In type An, for an integer pair (k, j), there exists
a special Wely element w that gives rise to an isomorphism between Aq(n(w)) and quan-
tum coordinate ring Aq(M at(k, j)) of the space of k × j-matrices (see [11, Section 12.4] for
In this case, if b1, b2 are the quantum minors, the condition b1b2 ∈ qZB∗
more detail).
is equivalent to the quasicommuting property: e,t b1b2 = qnb2b1 for some integer n. In
[18] Leclerc and Zelevinsky introduce a combinatorial notion of weak separation to describe
the quasicommuting property for any two quantum minors b1, b2, and then there are some
progress on quasicommuting property of any two quantum minors, such as, Scott’s work [26]
and the recent work by Oh, Postnikov and Speyer [22]. In the general case, there is no related
results on this problem.

In this paper, we consider the case when b1 and b2 are quantum minors in Aq(n) and then
give an equivalent combinatorial conditions of the Konstant partitions (λ1, λ2) to describe
the condition b1b2 ∈ qZB∗. More generally, we can check the quasicommuting condition for
any two quantum cluster monomials with the seeds of quantum minors. We remark that
the quantum minors are dependent on the choice of the reduced expression of w0. In our
concerning case, this reduced expression is given by the Coxeter element CQ.

Let us explain this more explicitly. The quantum minors correspond to the so-called
determinantal modules over the preprojective algebra ΛQ (see [11]). The Konstant partitions
corresponding to determinantal modules are a sort of special partition: They can be regarded
as a sequence of Auslander-Reiten translation τ orbit of an indecomposable representation of
Q in our concerning case. Surprisingly, they are similar to the objects in the cluster category
given by the derived category of representations of Q (see [3]).

Unlike their approaches, we interpret a as a nilpotent r × r matrix where r is the number of

posable. This allows us consider the map ra,b as a Lie bracket of a, b on the matrix space

makes the map ra,b more easier to calculate. Because we just consider the decomposition of

Since any indecomposable representation Mi corresponds to a positive root λi ∈ R+ by
Gabriel’s Theorem. Hence, any representation M gives rise to a root sequence (λ1, λ2, · · · , λr)
such that λi ≥ λj for any i < j, and M = ⊕iMλi. We call this sort root sequences for Kon-
stant Partitions and denote by KP(α) the set of Konstant partitions for α. Therefore, the
map ra,b is uniquely determinated by the Konstant partitions λ, κ associated with modules
N respectively. That means we should ﬁnd a combinatorial condition on the pair (λ, κ)

Where τ = CQ is the Coxeter element that adapted with the orientation of Q. This implies
that the Auslander-Reiten translation of Mβ subjects to τ Mβ = Mτ β, where Mβ refers to the
indecomposable representation corresponding to the root β.

Let α and β be two roots, set

R(α, β) = {r ∈ Z | HomQ(τ rMα, Mβ) 6= 0}

We show that R(α, β) is of a segment of integers and calculate this set using a condition of
the Coxeter element, (see Proposition (3.11) for more detail). For simplicity, we denote by
lu[a, b] the number of the set [0, u] ∩ [a, b] and by lc
u[a, b] the number of the complement of
the set [0, u] ∩ [a, b] in [0, u]. we always write lu[a, b] for the set or the number of this set if
there is no confusion. For example, we write lu[a, b] ∩ lc

u[c, d] for the set

[a, b] ∩ [c, d]c ∩ [0, u]

or the number of its elements

|[a, b] ∩ [c, d]c ∩ [0, u]|

where [c, d]c is the complement of [c, d]. In what follows, we write Mλ for the representation
associated with the Konstant partition λ and
Mλ for the module (Mλ, a) such that a is the
dual of M in the sense of (2.7). For simplicity, we always write [Mλ, Mκ] (resp: [Mλ, τ Mκ])
for dim HomQ(Mλ, Mκ) (resp: dim HomQ(Mλ, τ Mκ)).

Theorem 1.2. Let λ = (τ uβa, · · · , τ βa, βa) and κ = (τ vβb, · · · , τ βb, βb) for some roots βa, βb
and some integers u, v. Put

(1.3)

R(βa, βb) = [s, t]

and

dλ,κ = u − v − 1

We get the following equations
[Mλ, Mκ] − [Mλ, τ Mκ] = lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc
Here lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ] means the number of set

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

[u − t, u − s] ∩ [dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]c ∩ [0, u]

and

dim Ker ra,b =

lv[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1] ∩ [v − u + 1, v]

(

if u ≥ v
if u < v

In particular, ra,b is surjective if and only if

(1) if u ≥ v

lv[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1]

=lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

(2) if u < v

lv[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1] ∩ [v − u + 1, v]

=lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

This theorem seems strange to most readers. This precisely shows that the map ra,b is
too diﬃcult to calculate in general. Otherwise, Lapid and Minguez don’t need a so-called
randomized algorithm. Here are some corollary to interpret some well-known results.

Corollary 1.3 ([10]). For any τ -orbit Konstant partition λ we have that

Remark 1.6. If we consider λ = (τ uβ, · · · , β) as the Konstant partition associated with
quantum minor D(a, b) such that β = βa and τ uβ = βb. The ﬁrst corollary means D(a, b)2 ∈

for some integer n. Here ν and µ are Weyl elements such that β = ν(αia) and µ = τ uν. The
condition β = τ kθa and α = τ kθb for some integer k means ναib = α.

The third corollary is an interpretation of the following formula. [11, Proposition 5.5]

Since Dynkin quivers are bipartite orientations, e,t I = I0 ∪ I1, we have that w0 = ch/2

(1.7)

i = [i1i2 · · · ini1 · · · in · · · i1 · · · in · · · ik]

We remark that i is adapted to Q. We always write τ for the Coxeter element CQ.

Here is our main theorem.

Theorem 1.7. Let D(b, d) and D(k, l) be two quantum minors induced from the above word i,
let us write λ(b, d) = (τ uβb = βd, · · · , βb) and λ(k, l) = (τ vβk = βl, · · · , βk) for the Konstant
partitions for D(b, d) and D(k, l), respectively. Set
(1.8) R(βb, βk) = [s, t], R(βk, βb) = [s′, t′], and d(b,d),(k,l) = u − v − 1, d(k,l),(b,d) = v − u − 1

we have

D(b, d)D(k, l) ∈ qZB∗

if and only if they satisfy the following condition

(1) if u = v

lu[s, t] = lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[−1 − t, −1 − s] − lc

and

lu[s′, t′] = lu[u − t′, u − s′] ∩ lc

u[−1 − t′, −1 − s′] − lc

u[u − t′, u − s′] ∩ lu[−1 − t′, −1 − s′]

and

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS7

This theorem looks like quite strange. We remark that the right side of these formulas
is of the symmetric form. The left side of these formulas represents the replacement of
(D(b, d), D(k, l)). This phenomena is similar with the R-matrices RD(b,d),D(k,l) in the sense
of [12]. The advantage of this theorem is to make it feasible to calculate all quantum minor
pairs (D(b, d), D(k, l)).

More generally, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 1.8. Let a = (a1, a2, · · · , ar) and b = (b1, b2, · · · , bt) be two tuples of positive
integers, and let Z1 = X a and Z2 = Y b be two quantum cluster monomials in Aq(n) with
respect to the clusters (X1, X2, · · · , Xr) and (Y1, Y2, · · · , Yr) respectively such that all Xi and
Yj are quantum minors. The following holds
Z1Z2 ∈ qZB∗

(equivalently Z1Z2 = qnZ2Z1 for some n ∈ Z)

(1.9)

if and only if for any pair (ai, bj) such that ai 6= 0 and bj 6= 0, we have the quantum minors
Xi, Yj satisﬁes the condition in Theorem 1.7.
As an application, we give another equivalent combinatorial condition when Ext1
Mκ) =
Λ(
0 for any two ladder multisegments λ, κ. In [14, Lemma 6.21], Lapid and Minguez give an
equivalent combinatorial condition when Ext1
Mκ) = 0 for any two ladder multiseg-
Λ(
ments λ, κ. Although our condition seems like more diﬃcult, this condition makes it feasible
to check Ext1
Λ(

Mκ) = 0 for any two ladder multisegments λ, κ (see Section (4.6)).

Let us brieﬂy explain the structure of this paper. In Section (2), we give the deﬁnition of dual
representations of Q. Although this notion is known by related experts, we give a precise
interpretation of this notion by the automorphism groups’ action on the extension groups.
In Section (3), we calculate the map ra,b using the results in Section (2).
In Section (4),
we recall the cluster category over preprojective algebras and prove some well-known results
about determinantal modules using our approach in Section (3). In Section (5), we review
the cluster structure on the quantum coordinate ring and show an equivalent combinatorial
condition when the product of any two quantum minors is in the dual canonical bases (up to
q-power rescaling).

Notions and conventions. In this paper, a quiver Q = (I, Ω) consists of a set of vertices I
and a set of arrows Ω. Denote by n the number of vertices if there is no danger of confusion.
For an arrow h one denotes by s(h) and t(h) its source and target, respectively. For our
purposes, we assume that Q is of Dynkin type. The quiver Q gives rise to a symmetric
matrix CQ, simply write C, by

(1.10)

ai,j =

−♯{h : i → j} − ♯{h : j → i}

if i = j
otherwise

We write αi for its simple root. Let Q = Z[αi]i∈I be its root lattice. The matrix C induces a
bilinear form on Q, we write (−, −) for it. We denote by Q+ ⊂ Q the subset N[αi]i∈I of Q.

It is well known that (α, β) = hα, βi + hβ, αi. We write ωi for the fundamental weights and
let P + = N[ωi]i∈I be dominant weights. We write W for its Weyl group generated by simple
reﬂections si associated with simple roots αi for any i ∈ I. Denote by R+ the set of positive
roots.

Let us ﬁx an orientation of Q such that the indexing set of I satisfying

2. Representation theory of Dynkin quivers

In this section, we brieﬂy review some basic facts on the representation theory of Dynkin
quivers. We will construct some maps related to representation space Eα, and deﬁne dual
representations of Q in the sense of Lusztig’s nilpotent varieties.

Fix a Dynkin quiver Q. Let M = (V, x) be a representation of Q where V is an I-graded
vector space and x = (xh)h∈Ω is a tuple of matrices xh : Vs(h) → Vt(h) for all arrows h ∈ Ω.
We sometimes write the matrices x for the representation M if there is no danger of confusion.
i∈I dim(Vi)αi ∈ Q+.
For a representation M = (V, x), we write dimM for its dimension
Given two representations M, N of Q, we denote by HomQ(M, N ) the vector space of Q-
morphisms between M and N and write [M, N ] (resp: [M, N ]1) for dim HomQ(M, N ) (resp:
dim Ext1

Q(M, N )). One has

P

For any vertex i ∈ I, we associate it with the indecomposable projective (resp:
injective)
representation Pi (resp: Ii), and the head (resp: socle) of Pi (resp: Ii) is the simple module
Si.

2.1. Representations of Dynkin quivers. In this section we review some relation between
root system and representations of Dynkin quiver Q. Let w ∈ W be element of the Wely
group W . A reduced expression of w = sim · · · si2si1 gives rise to a word i = [i1i2 · · · im]. This
yields a set of roots as follows:

(2.2)

αi1; si1(αi2); · · · si1si2 · · · sik−1(αik ); · · · si1si2 · · · sim−1(αim)

Let us denote them by βk = si1si2 · · · sik−1(αik ) for 1 ≤ k ≤ m and give them an ordering so
that βl < βk if l < k. we write w = w0 for the unique element in W with maximal length
and C = si1si2 · · · sn for the Coxeter element of W . Denote by h the Coxeter number.

From an orientation of Q given by (1.12), one deﬁnes a Coxeter element CQ = si1si2 · · · sin.
It is easy to see that i1 is a source and in is a sink. Since Dynkin quivers are bipartite
h−1
orientations,e,t I = I0 ∪ I1, we have that w0 = C h/2
2
Q C1 where C1
is the I1 part of CQ if h is odd. It gives rise to a word of w0 as

Q if h is even or w0 = C

(2.3)

i = [i1i2 · · · ini1 · · · in · · · i1 · · · in · · · ik]

It is easy to see i is adapted to Q.
For any k ∈ [1, r] where r is the length of w0, let us consider βk and set the following subset
of R+:

βk = {βj | ij = ik}

Theorem 2.1. [Gabriel’s Theorem] If Q is a Dynkin quiver, then the map M 7→ dimM gives
rise to a bijection between the set of isomorphic classes of indecomposable representations and
the set of positive roots R+.

We denote by Mβ the module corresponding to the root β. If the order of positive roots is
given as in 2.2 for the word 2.3, one has

(2.7)

HomQ(Mβa, Mβb) = Ext1

Q(Mβb, Mβa) = 0

for βa < βb

We sometimes write [βk, βl] (resp: [βk, βl]1) for dim Hom(Mβk , Mβl) (resp: dim Ext1
for simplicity.

Q(Mβk , Mβl))

Since any representation M with dimM = α can be decomposed as a direct sum of indecom-
posable representations, we associate each M with a sequence of roots λ = (λ1, λ2, · · · , λr)
such that M ∼= ⊕r
k=1Mλi and for any k ∈ [1, s] such that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λs. Therefore, one
can deﬁne the Konstant partition λ by

λ = (λ1, λ2, · · · , λs)
where λk ∈ R+ such that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λs. Denote by KP(α) the set of Konstant partitions
s
satisfying
i=1 λi = α. It is straight to see that the set of Gα-orbits in Eα (isomorphic classes
of representations of Q with dimension vector α) coincides with KP(α) (see (1.13)).

There is an ordering on representations with dimension α (up to isomorphism) given by
M ≤ N if ON ⊂ OM where M, N ∈ Eα, ON is the Gα-orbit of N , and OM is the Zariski
closure of orbit OM . Therefore, we deﬁne an ordering on KP(α) so that λ′ ≤ λ if their
associated representations satisfying Mλ′ ≤ Mλ. That is:
λ′ ≤ λ ⇐⇒ OMλ ⊂ OMλ′

(2.8)

P

Following [7], we have

(2.9)

λ′ ≤ λ =⇒ [Mλ′, Mλ′ ]1 ≤ [Mλ, Mλ]1

2.2. An example of An. Let us consider the type An, we denote by [1, n] the set of integers
k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. We ﬁx an orientation of An as follows:

(2.10)

1 −→ 2 −→ · · · −→ n

The Coxeter element CQ is given by τ = CQ := si1si2 · · · sin. It induces a reduced expression
of w0 as follows.

w0 = s1s2s3 · · · sns1s2 · · · sns1 · · · sn · · ·

Thus, we obtain a word

(2.11)

{1, 2, · · · , n, 1, 2, · · · , n, · · · , 1, 2, · · · , n, · · · }
It is well-known that the set R+ of positive roots is identiﬁed with the set of segments

[a, b] such that a ≤ b. It is easy to check

(2.12)

τ ([k, l]) = CQ([k, l]) = [k + 1, l + 1] if l ≤ n − 1

The ordering of R+ is given by the following lemma.

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS11

Lemma 2.2. The ordering of segments as in (2.2) is given by

[i, j] < [k, l] if i < k or i = k and j < l

Proof. By the deﬁnition (2.5), we obtain

θk = [1, k]

for k ∈ [1, n]

For any i such that k + i ≤ n, it follows by 2.12 that τ iθk = [i + 1, k + i]. The ordering of R+
in (2.2) and the word (2.11) implies that τ iθk < τ jθl if and only if i < j or i = j and k < l.
(cid:3)
Namely, [i + 1, i + k] < [j + 1, j + l] if and only if i < j or i = j and i + k < j + l.

The Gabriel’s Theorem (2.1) implies that any indecomposable representations of An is of
αi. We list some properties of indecomposable

the form M [a, b] such that dimM [a, b] =

representations.

(2.13)

a≤i≤b
P
[M [i, j], M [k, l]] = 1 if and only if k ≤ i ≤ l ≤ j
[M [k, l], M [i, j]]1 = 1 if and only if k + 1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1 ≤ j.

Moreover, for each [M [k, l], M [i, j]]1 = 1, we have the following short exact sequence

(2.14)

0 → M [i, j] → M [i, l] ⊕ M [k, j] → M [k, l] → 0

where we formally set M [i, j] = 0 if i < 1 or j > n or j < i.

For each representation M of An, one can decompose every representation

M ∼= M [a1, b1] ⊕ M [a2, b2] ⊕ M [am, bm]
for some m ≥ 1. We arrange this tuple ([a1, b1], [a2, b2], · · · [am, bm]) such that [ak, bk] ≥
It follows that for any
[ak+1, bk+1] for any k ∈ [1, m − 1], which is called multisegment.
α ∈ Q+, the set of the Konstant partitions KP(α) is identiﬁed with the set of multisegments
([a1, b1], · · · , [am, bm]) such that

m
i=1[ak, bm] = α.

It is straightforward to see any two roots α = [a, b], β = [c, d] with the same length: e,t.
b − a = d − c, have the relation α = β[k] for some integer k. This means that any two
segments α = [a, b], β = [c, d] are in the same τ -orbit: e,t. α = τ kβ for some k ∈ Z, if and
only if their length are same. It implies that β[j,k] = {βk, βk[−1], · · · , βj[1], βj }.

Let us consider the EndQ(M )-action on HomΩ(V, W ) by η · f = (ηhfs(h)). This action
gives rise to an EndQ(M )-action on Ext1
Q(M, N ). In order to see that it is a well-deﬁned
action, we should check that for any η ∈ Im px,y and f ∈ EndQ(M ), we have η · f ∈ Im px,y.
Considering η = (gt(h)xh − yhgs(h))h∈Ω for g ∈ HomI (V, W ) and the following equation,

η · f =(gt(h)xhfs(h) − yhgs(h)fs(h))h∈Ω
=(gt(h)ft(h)xh − yhgs(h)fs(h))h∈Ω
=px,y(gf )

by xhfs(h) = ft(h)xh for any f ∈ EndQ(M )

we obtain our conclusion. That is, ¯η · f = (ηhfs(h))h∈Ω for an element η of e−1
that Ext1
via g · ¯η = (gt(h)ηh)h∈Ω for an element η of e−1

Q(M, N ) is a module of EndQ(M )op. Similarly, Ext1

x,y(¯η). It follows
Q(M, N ) is a module of EndQ(N )

x,y(¯η).

2.4. The action of automorphism groups on extension spaces. Let us ﬁx a repre-
sentation M = (V, x) with dimension α ∈ Q+. Let us consider its self-extension group
Ext1
Q(M, M ). The left EndQ(M )-module structure and the right EndQ(M )-module struc-
ture on Ext1

Q(M, M ) as above gives rise to a well-deﬁned action on Ext1

Q(M, M ) via

f ⋆′ ¯η = (ft(h)ηhfs(h))

for some η ∈ e−1

x,x(¯η).

We denote by AutQ(M ) the isomorphism group of M in EndQ(M ), which is an open
subvariety of EndQ(M ) in the Zariski topology, as it is deﬁned by the equation that the
determinants of elements of EndQ(M ) is not equal to zero. We deﬁne an AutQ(M ) action
on Ext1
s(h))h∈Ω. If we consider AutQ(M ) as a subset of Gα,

Q(M, M ) by g ⋆ η = (gt(h)ηhg−1

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS13

the discussion as before implies that this action is compatible with the Gα on Eα when we
consider η ∈ Ext1

Q(M, M ) as an element in Eα by the formula (2.15). In other words,

(2.18)

g ⋆ ¯η = g · η ∀η ∈ HomΩ(V, V ) and ∀g ∈ AutQ(M )

We denote by Oη the AutQ(M )-orbit of η ∈ Ext1

Q(M, M )
is a quotient space of HomΩ(V, V ), this is not easy to understand these orbits. Therefore,
we consider the dual spaces of HomΩ(V, V )∗. Let us review some basic facts on the functor
Homk(−, k) on the space Homk(Vi, Wj) for some i, j ∈ I. Fix a basis (e1, e2, · · · , er) of Vi
and a basis (f1, f2, · · · , ft) of Wj. It is well known that

Considering the formula (2.30) and replacing N by M , we obtain a representation ηt ∈ E∗
α
for any η ∈ Eα. The Gα-action is compatible with respect to the transport of matrices. It
follows that η ≤ η′ if and only if ηt ≤ η′t.

For an element η ∈ D Ext1

Q(M, M ), set

NGα(η) =

g ∈ Gα | g · η ∈ D Ext1

Q(M, M )

It is easy to see that AutQ(M ) is a subgroup of NGα(η). Let us denoted by B the quotient
variety NGα(η)/ AutQ(M ). It follows that
Oη ∩ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) = ⊔g∈BOg·η

(2.31)

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

and each of orbit with the same dimension. Since AutQ(M )-action on D Ext1
Q(M, M ) is com-
patible with Gα-action on Eα. Let ZAutQ(M )(η) be the center of η with respect to AutQ(M ),
namely,

and let ZGα(η) be the center of η with respect to Gα, that is,

ZAutQ(M )(η) = {g ∈ AutQ(M ) | g · η = η}

ZGα(η) = {g ∈ Gα | g · η = η}

It is easy to see that ZAutQ(M )(η) = ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ).
ZGα(η).

It induces an decomposition of

(2.32)

ZGα(η) =

(ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))g

where D is the quotient ZGα(η)/ZAutQ(M )(η).

Let g′ ∈ B and consider

Gg∈D

ZGα(g′ · η) =

g ∈ Gα | gg′ · η = η

This implies that gg′ ∈ ZGα(η) for all g ∈ ZGα(g′ · η). That is: ZGα(g′ · η) = ZGα(η)g′. The
equation 2.32 leads to

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

(2.33)

ZGα(g′ · η) =

(ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))gg′

Let h ∈ (ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))gg′ and h ∈ ZAutQ(M )(g′ · η). Since

Gg∈D

ZAutQ(M )(g′ · η) = ZGα(g′ · η) ∩ AutQ(M )
we see that h ∈ AutQ(M ) and h(gg′)−1 ∈ AutQ(M ). It implies that gg′ ∈ AutQ(M ). We
claim that there exists only one g ∈ D such that gg′ ∈ AutQ(M ). Otherwise, let g1, g2 be two
diﬀerent elements such that g1g′, g2g′ ∈ AutQ(M ). The decomposition 2.33 has two disjoint
union of (ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M )). Multiplying the decomposition 2.33 by g′−1, we obtain

(ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))g′−1 = (ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))g1 = (ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))g2
Because the map induced by multiplication of g′−1 is an isomorphism between ZGα(g′ · η)
and ZGα(η). This leads to a contradiction of the disjoint decomposition (2.32).

16

YINGJIN.BI

Therefore, there exits a unique element g such that

(ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))gg′ ∩ ZAutQ(M )(g′ · η) 6= ∅

The fact gg′ ∈ AutQ(M ) and the disjoint decomposition 2.33 implies that

ZAutQ(M )(g′ · η) = (ZGα(η) ∩ AutQ(M ))gg′ = ZAutQ(M )(η)gg′

As a corollary, we obtain

(2.34)

dim ZAutQ(M )(g′ · η) = dim ZAutQ(M )(η)

for all g′ ∈ B

The formula dim Oη = dim AutQ(M ) − dim ZAutQ(M )(η) implies that for any g ∈ B,

dim Oη = dim Og·η

Since OM ∩D Ext1
to the set of the irreducible components of OM ∩ D Ext1
B is a ﬁnite set.

Q(M, M ) is a quasi-aﬃne variety over C, the decomposition 2.31 corresponds
Q(M, M ). In particular, we see that

Lemma 2.3. Let η, η′ ∈ Eα and suppose η ≤ η′ as in 2.8. (2.15) implies that they induce ele-
ments in Ext1
Q(M, M ) via the action (2.18).
We have

Q(M, M ). Consider their AutQ(M )-orbits in Ext1

Oη′ ⊂ Og·η

for some g ∈ Gα.
Proof. By the above discussions, it is enough to show that Oη′t ⊂ Ogηt in D Ext1
for some g ∈ Gα. Note that Oηt ∩ D Ext1
D Ext1

Q(M, M ). Since AutQ(M ) is a subgroup of Gα and Oη′t ⊂ Oηt by 2.8, we get

Q(M, M )
Q(M, M ), denoted by Y , is a closed subset of

On the other hand, since Oηt ∩ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) is an open and dense subset of Y and 2.31

Oη′t ⊂ Oη′t ∩ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) ⊂ Y

Oηt ∩ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) =

Og·ηt

[g∈B

It implies that Y ⊂ ∪g∈BOg·ηt, as B is a ﬁnite set. It leads to that there exists a g ∈ Gα
(cid:3)
such that η′t ∈ Og·ηt. Hence, Oη′t ⊂ Og·ηt.
Proposition 2.4. Under the above assumption, Ext1
Q(M, M ) admits an open AutQ(M )-orbit
if and only if there exists an element η ∈ D Ext1
Q(M, M ) with the minimal dimension [η, η]1
and NGα(η) is an irreducible variety, where η ∈ Eα is considered as a representation of Q
with dimension vector α.

Proof. If Ext1
Q(M, M ) admits an open AutQ(M )-orbit Oη. Since there is only Oη with the
maximal dimension, it follows by (2.31) that B = e and then NGα(η) = AutQ(M ). This
implies that NGα(η) is an irreducible variety.

Because Oη ∩ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) is an open dense subset of D Ext1

D Ext1

Q(M, M ) ⊂ Oη, this means for any element η′ ∈ D Ext1

Q(M, M ), we get that
Q(M, M ), we have Oη′ ⊂ Oη.

Hence, we obtain η ≤ η′ for any η ∈ D Ext1
any η′ ∈ D Ext1

Q(M, M ).

Q(M, M ). 2.9 implies that [η, η]1 ≤ [η′, η′]1 for

On the other hand, if [η, η]1 is of the minimal with respect to any η′ ∈ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) by 2.9. Recall that B is a ﬁnite

then Oη is of maximal dimension for all η′ ∈ D Ext1
set, the following decomposition

NGα(η) = ⊔g∈B AutQ(M )g

implies that the set of irreducible components of NGα(η) is identiﬁed with B. Since NGα(η)
is irreducible, we obtain B = {e} and then AutQ(M ) = NGα(η). The decomposition (2.31)
(cid:3)
implies that Oη ∩ D Ext1

Q(M, M ) = Oη is an open dense subvariety of D Ext1

Q(M, M ).

Remark 2.5. This proposition is useful, as we always ﬁnd the element η ∈ D Ext1
Q(M, M )
with minimal [η, η]1 for any representation M of Q. The problem of the open AutQ(M )-orbit
in Ext1
Q(M, M ) turns out to be checking the irreducible property of the variety NGα(η).

Proposition 2.6. Ext1
Q(M, M ) such that [η, EndQ(M )] = Ext1

Q(M, M ) | [η, η]1 ≤ [η′, η′] ∀η′ ∈ D Ext1

3. Auslander-Reiten Theory

In this section, we will recall the Auslander-Reiten theory for Dynkin quivers. As we
discussed before, the AutQ(M ) action on the extension space Ext1

Proposition 3.1. The following propositions are not only true in the Dynkin cases.

(1) In acyclic cases, we have τ M = ΦCQM , where ΦCQ refers the reﬂection functor 2.6

CQ(dimV ) as an element in Q+.

3.2. Representations and root system. In this section, we will give an interpretation of
the condition [Mβ, Mα] = 1 in terms of the relation between roots β and α. This seems like an
interesting link. This relation become more interesting when we consider the AR translation
τ . Due to Proposition (3.1), in what follows, we denote by τ the Coxeter element CQ in
Section (2.1).

Lemma 3.4. Suppose that α < β ∈ R+. If [Mβ, Mα] = [β, α] = 0, then we have α + β ∈ R+
or (α, β) = 0. Moreover, we have 0 → Mβ → Mα+β → Mα → 0 when α + β ∈ R+.
Proof. If [β, α] = 0, it implies that hβ, αi = [β, α] − [β, α]1 = 0 by formula (2.7). On the other
hand, we have hα, βi = [α, β] − [α, β]1 = −[α, β]1 by formula (2.7). If −[α, β]1 = 0, it implies
that (α, β) = 0. If −[α, β]1 6= 0, then the fact that [α, β]1 ≤ 1 for any roots α, β implies that
−[α, β]1 = −1. Hence, we obtain (α, β) = −1. It follows that sβ(α) = α − (α, β)β = α + β ∈
R+.

Take a nonzero extension E ∈ Ext1

Q(Mα, Mβ), The [7, Lemma 4.1] implies that E <

Mα ⊕ Mβ. It is easy to see by 2.9 and [Mα, Mα]1 = [Mβ, Mβ]1 = 0 that

[E, E]1 < [Mα ⊕ Mβ, Mα ⊕ Mβ]1 = 1

This implies that E is a rigid representation with dimension vector α + β; e,t.Ext1
Q(E, E) = 0.
Since the indecomposable representation Mα+β associated with root α + β is also a rigid
representation and any rigid representations with same dimension vector are isomorphic, we
see that E ∼= Mα+β ∈ Ext1

Q(Mα, Mβ). Namely, we get the following short exact sequence:

0 → Mβ → Mα+β → Mα → 0

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.5. Let α < β ∈ R+. There are four cases as follows:

(1) [β, α] = [β, τ α] = 1;
(2) α + β ∈ R+ if and only if [β, α] = 0 and [β, τ α] = 1

(3) β − α ∈ R if and only if [β, α] = 1 and [β, τ α] = 0
(4) [β, α] = [β, τ α] = 0.

Proof. It is straight to see cases (1), (4). The relation (2.7) implies that

It follows from (2.1) and Proposition (3.1) that

[α, β] = [β, α]1 = 0

and

Therefore, we obtain

hα, βi = −[α, β]1 = −[β, τ α]

hβ, αi = [β, α]

(α, β) = hα, βi + hβ, αi = [β, α] − [β, τ α]
In the case (2), the condition (α, β) = −1 is equivalent to sα(β) = β − (α, β)α = β + α in
R+. This condition coincides with [β, α] = 0 and [β, τ α] = 1, as [β, α] ≤ 1 and [β, τ α] ≤ 1.

Similarly, in the case (3). (α, β) = 1 coincides with the condition [β, α] = 1 and [β, τ α] = 0,
(cid:3)

it is equivalent to sα(β) = β − (α, β)α = β − α ∈ R.

Lemma 3.6. For two roots θa > θb as in (2.5).

(1) If there exists a path ib → ia, we have [θa, θb] = 1 and [θa, τ θb] = 0; and θa − θb ∈ R+.

In particular, θa − θb > θa > θb

(2) If there exists no path ib → ia, we have [θa, θb] = 0 and [θa, τ θb] = 0, and (θa, θb) = 0.

Proof. Recall that θk = si1si2 · · · sik−1(αik ) for k = a, b. It is easy to see by the ordering on
I that ia and ib are the sinks of the support of θa and θb respectively. The relation θa > θb
implies a > b. Let us put w = sib · · · sia−1 and write θa = si1si2 · · · sib−1wαia .

If w(αia ) =

k>b nkαik + nbαib for nb > 0, this means there exists a path ρ : ib → ia.
Because for any k < a the condition that αik is in the support sik (αia) = αia − (αik , αia )αik
coincides with (αik , αia ) 6= 0. Recall that the symmetric bilinear form is given by 1.10, this
means there is an arrow h : ik → ia, as k < a. By induction, we see that nb 6= 0 if and only
if there exists a path ρ : ib → ia.

the reﬂection sθb(θa) = θa − nbθb implies that θa − θb ∈ R+. The relation τ θb > θa implies by
2.7 that [θa, τ θb] = 0. Since (θa − θb) + θb = θa, the convex property of the ordering of roots
implies that

θa − θb > θa > θb

We will discuss the relation between Auslander-Reiten translations and the support of roots.
for a root β =
k∈[t,s] nkαik such that nk > 0 for all k ∈ [t, s], we denote by soc β (resp: hd β)
the set of sink (resp: source) vertices in the support of β, such as s (resp: t). It is easy to
see that the simple representation Sis (resp: Sit) is a socle (resp: head) of the corresponding
representation Mβ (recall that ik → il then k < l). We explain that why the maximal point
s corresponds to the socle of representation Mβ: Because we consider the representation
Mβ as a right module over the quiver algebra kQ. For instance, for each vertex i ∈ I, the
irreducible projective module Pi is given by eikQ where ei is the idempotent element for i,
and the injective representation Ii is deﬁned by (kQei)∗, the hd Pi = i satisﬁes j ≥ i for
∀j ∈ supp Pi and soc Ii = i satisﬁes j ≤ i for ∀j ∈ supp Ii
Lemma 3.7. Under the above assumption, for any k such that τ kβ ∈ R+, we have

(3.10)

hd τ kβ ≥ hd β and soc τ kβ ≥ soc β

Here we say that S ≤ T if for any u ∈ S there exists an element v ∈ T such that u ≤ v.

Proof. For simplicity, it is enough to prove the case when k = 1. Recall that ik ∈ soc β if and
only if [Sik , Mβ] 6= 0 and ik ∈ hd β if and only if [Mβ, Sik ] 6= 0.

Let us ﬁrst consider the simple representations Sik for all non-source vertices of Q. From

the AR-exact sequence for Sik

0 → Sik → ⊕βMβ → τ −1Sik → 0
Since [Sik , Mβ] 6= 0 for all Mβ in the second term of this sequence, we see that ik ∈ soc Mβ
and then supp β ⊂ [1, k] by deﬁnition soc β for all Mβ in the second term of this sequence.
It is easy to see by the above short exact sequence that supp τ −1Sik ⊂ [1, k].

Let us take ik ∈ hd τ β and consider the following equation by Proposition 3.1

(3.11)

[τ Mβ, Sik ] = [Mβ, τ −1Sik ]

Let β =
∅ that [τ Mβ, Sik ] = 0. It leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we get hd τ β ≥ hd β.

0 → τ Sik → ⊕βMβ → Sik → 0

Similarly, we obtain supp τ Sik ⊂ [k, n].

Let us take ik ∈ soc τ −1β and consider the following equation by Proposition 3.1

[Sik , τ −1Mβ] = [τ Sik , Mβ]

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS23

Let β =
that [Sik , τ −1Mβ] = 0. This means soc τ −1β ≤ soc β. Namely, soc β ≤ soc τ β.

j∈[t,s] njαij . If k > s, then supp τ Sik ⊂ [k, n]. It follows by the fact [t, s] ∩ [1, k] = ∅

P

Therefore, we obtain

(3.13)

hd τ β ≥ hd β and soc τ β ≥ soc β

We remark that if ik ∈ hd β (resp: ik ∈ soc β) such that ik is a source (resp: sink) of Q, this
formula follows from the AR-sequence

and hd τ Mβ ≥ hd E ≥ hd Mβ and soc τ Mβ ≥ soc E ≥ soc Mβ

0 → τ Mβ → E → Mβ → 0

Next, we will show that for any two roots α, β, we have

(3.14)

R(α, β) =

k ∈ Z≥0 | [τ kα, β] = 1

Where τ b+1α + β ∈ R+. We prove this using the classiﬁcation of the root pair (α, β). Let us

Lemma 3.8. Let Mβ be the indecomposable representation of Q for the root β. Let us set
nβ = max{k ∈ N | [τ kβ, β] = 1} = min{k ∈ N | [τ kβ, β] = 0} − 1

(3.15)

We have

This formula means

k ∈ Z≥0 | [τ kβ, β] = 1

τ nβ+1β + β ∈ R+
= [0, nβ]

Proof. For simplicity, we just consider the case β = θa for all a ∈ I, as [τ kβ, τ β] = [τ k−1β, β]
(cid:9)
(cid:8)
and any β = τ uθa for some n ∈ N, a ∈ I.

We ﬁrst show that

k ∈ Z≥0 | [τ kθa, θa] = 1

= [0, na]

This means there exists no n′ such that [τ n′
take s < na such that [τ sθa, θa] = [τ s+1θa, τ θa] = 0 and [τ s+1θa, θa] = 1.

θa, θa] = 0 and [τ n′+1θa, θa] = 1. Otherwise, we

It follows by Proposition (3.5) that α = τ s+1θa −θa ∈ R. This implies that (τ s+1θa, θa) > 0

by

α = sθa(τ s+1θa) = τ s+1θa − (τ s+1θa, θa)θa

Let w = si1si2 · · · sia−1 and θa = w(αia ). Recall that τ = si1si2 · · · sin. We see that

τa := w−1τ w = siasia−1 · · · si1sin · · · sia−1
(3.16)
gives rise to a quiver Qa such that ia is a source of Qa and τa is a coxeter element adapted
with Qa.
Since

This means γ := τ s+1

a αia − αia ∈ R. It is easy to see that γ ∈ R+, otherwise,

for nk ≥ 0 implies that nk = 0 for all ik ∈ I. This is a contradiction. The ordering of positive
roots by 2.2 implies that τ s+1
a αia >a αia. Here >a refers to the ordering of R+ induced
by the Coxeter element τa as in Section 2.1. The convex property of this ordering leads to
γ >a τ s+1

a αia >a αia, as γ + αia = τ s+1

a αia.

By Lemma (3.4), we obtain

0 → Mγ → τ s+1

a Sia → Sia → 0

Note that Mγ is a representation of Qb rather than that of Q. Therefore, we have
hd τ s+1

a Sia = hd Sia

By Lemma (3.7), we have

This implies that there exists a surjective map: τ s

a Sia → Sia → 0. This means

ia = hd Sia ≤a hd τ s

a Sia ≤a hd τ s+1

a Sia = ia

[τ s

a Sia, Sia] = [τ s+1

a Sia, τaSia] = 1

Following Proposition (3.5), we get τ s+1

a αia − αia /∈ R. This means

w(τ s+1

a αia − αia) = τ s+1θa − θa /∈ R

This leads to a contradiction.

On the other hand, the equation τ mβ +β ∈ R+ implies by Proposition (3.5) that [τ mβ, β] = 0
(cid:3)
and [τ m−1β, β] = [τ mβ, τ β] = 1. By equation (3.15), we have that m = nβ + 1.
Lemma 3.9. Let n > a > b and θa, θb as in (2.5). Set
(3.17)

R(a, b) = {r ∈ N | [τ rθa, θb] = 1}
Then we have R(a, b) = ∅ if [θa, θb] = 0; In the case when [θa, θb] = 1 we have R(a, b) = [0, t]
such that τ t+1θa + θb ∈ R+.
Proof. Let us consider the Coxeter element τb := w−1
b CQwb, where wb = si1si2 · · · sib−1. It
can be expressed as sibsib+1 · · · sinsi1 · · · sib−1. Denote by Qb the orientation induced from this
Coxeter element τb. It is easy to see that ib is a source of Qb, it implies that Sib is an injective
representation of Qb.

First, we consider the case [θa, θb] = 0. Set u = sib · · · sia−1, we see that
(3.18)

θa = wbuαia and θb = wαib
It follows by Lemma (3.6) that there is no path from ib to ia. On the other hand, soc θa = ia
and soc θb = ib. Since the reﬂection functor Φi preserves the dimension of Hom-space [θa, θb],
we see that

(3.19)
This means that Sib is not a head of Muαia of Qb. In particular, by the form of

[θa, θb] = [uαia, αib] = 0

a

uαia =

nkαik

Xk>bb

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS25

we see that ib <b hd uαia, here we denote by <b the ordering of I given by the Coxeter
element τb. It follows by Lemma (3.7) that for any k such that τ k

b uαia ∈ R+

hd τ k

b Muαia ≥b hd Muαia >b Sib

This means [τ k

b Muαia , Sib] = 0 for any k > 0. Applying the reﬂection functor Φwb to this

equation, we obtain by (3.18),

for all k ∈ N.

[τ k

b uαia , αib] = [τ kθa, θb] = 0

Next, we suppose that there is a path from ib to ia. This means

a

uαia =

nkαik + nbαib

Xk>b

It follows that ib ∈ hd uαia.
Since [τ rθa, θb] = [τ r

b uαia, αib], we get

(3.20)

[τ rθa, θb] = 1 if and only if ib ∈ hd τ r

b uαia

It implies by Lemma (3.7) and hd uαia = ib that if [τ s+1
for all k ∈ [0, s]. It follows by 3.20 that

b

uαia, αib] = 1 then [τ k

b uαia, αib] = 1

[τ sθa, θb] = 1 =⇒ [τ kθa, θb] = 1 ∀k ∈ [0, s − 1]

This means R(a, b) = [0, t]. Proposition (3.5) (2) yields that τ t+1θa + θb ∈ R+.

Lemma 3.10. Let θa < θb. Set

R(a, b) = {r ∈ N | [τ rθa, θb] = 1}

We have R(a, b) = 0 if [τ θa, θb] = 0, or R(a, b) = [1, s] such that τ s+1θa + θb ∈ R+.

Proof. Replacing (θa, θb) in the above lemma with (τ θa, θb), we obtain this conclusion.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Therefore, we obtain the following proposition.

Proposition 3.11. Let θa, θb be two roots as in (2.5). Set

R(a, b) = {r ∈ N | HomQ(τ rMθa, Mθb) 6= 0}
Here Mθa and Mθb refers to the indecomposable representations for θa and θb , respectively.

(1) If a = b, we have R(a, a) = [0, s] such that C s+1
(2) If a > b, we have R(a, b) = ∅ if there exists no path from ib to ia. Otherwise, we have

Q θa + θa ∈ R+;

R(a, b) = [0, s] such that C s+1

Q θa + θb ∈ R+;

(3) If a < b, we have R(a, b) = ∅ if there exists no path from ia to ib. Otherwise, we have

R(a, b) = [1, s] such that C s+1

Q θa + θb ∈ R+.

Let us denote na,b by the maximal number s in R(a, b).

We denote by | α | the length of α. In other words, | α |= b − a if α = [a, b]

Let α and β be two roots such that | α |=| β |= m, we have

[M (α), M (β)]1 6= 0 if and only if α = β[−k] such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m.
Let us prove this. Let us write β as [i, i + m − 1] and α as [i − k, i + m − k − 1] for some

integer k. The equation 2.7 implies that [M (α), M (β)]1 6= 0 is equivalent to

i − k + 1 ≤ i ≤ i + m − k ≤ i + m − 1

This means 1 ≤ k ≤ m.
If | α |= m and | β |= n such that m > n, let α = [a, b] and β = [c, d], we have

(3.21)

and

(3.22)

R(α, β) = {k ∈ Z | [[a + k, b + k], [c, d]] = 1} = [c − a, d − a]

R(β, α) = {k ∈ Z | [[c + k, d + k], [a, b]] = 1} = [d − b, d − a]

The formula (2.13) leads to that [[a + k, b + k], [c, d]] = 1 if and only if c ≤ a + k ≤ d ≤ b + k.
It is easy to see that R(α, β) = [c − a, d − a]. On the other hand, R(β, α) = [d − b, d − a].

We remark that the relation ∆ = [a, b] ≺ ∆′ = [c, d] in the sense of [17] coincides with the
condition [M [a, b], M [c, d]]1 = 1. By Proposition (3.5) and Proposition 3.1 (2), that means
there are two cases for this relation:

(1) [M [a, b], M [c, d]] = 1 and [M [c, d], M [a + 1, b + 1]] = 1;
(2) [a, b] ∪ [c, d] = [a, d].

3.3. AR-orbits Konstant partitions. In this section, we will consider a sort of special
Konstant partitions: τ -orbit Konstant partition. This notion is from the quantum minors
D(p, q) in the quantum nilpotent coordinate ring Aq(n), where p, q are positive integers such
that p < q. In our cases, the Konstant partitions for these D(p, q) are the sequences with the
following form

(3.23)

(τ rβ, τ r−1βp, · · · , β)
for some r ∈ N and β ∈ R+ such that τ rβ ∈ R+. On the other hand, In [3] Buan, Marsh,
Reineke, Reiten and Todorov constructed the cluster category using the τ -quotient of the
derived category of representations of Q. Therefore, it is important to consider τ -orbit
Konstant partitions. However, this notion is new as for as we know.

Example 3.13. The τ -orbit Konstant partitions are of the form multisegments

λ = ([a + r, b + r], · · · , [a + 1, b + 1], [a, b])

3.4. The map ra,b. Recall the map ra,b in Lemma (3.3). This map plays an important role in
the following sections. This map is used to calculate the Ext1
N over
Λ(
ΛQ (see [1, Proposition 9.1]). Here we just focus on the case of τ -orbit Konstant partitions.
In fact, it is impossible to describe the map ra,b in all cases, even in the case of An with usual

orientation (see [16, Section 2.4]).

Fix a representation M = (V, x) of Q such that dimV = α ∈ Q+, let a ∈ HomQ(M, τ M ).
Let us consider the Konstant partition λ = (λ1, λ2, · · · , λr) ∈ KP(α) associated with M . As
λi > λj if i < j, we have by the equation 2.7 that

Π : HomQ(M, M ) ∼=

HomQ(Mλi, Mλj )

(3.24)

Mi≤j
f 7→ (fi,j)
Where fi,j is the composition of the embedding Mλi → M , f : M → M , and the projection
M → Mλj . Similarly, we have

(3.25)

HomQ(M, τ M ) ∼=

HomQ(Mλi, τ Mλj )

Mi<j
a 7→ (ai,j)

Note that HomQ(Mλi, τ Mλi ) = D Ext1
element a ∈ HomQ(M, τ M ) turns out to be a nilpotent matrix

Q(Mλi , Mλi) = 0 by Proposition 3.1. Therefore, any

a ∈ Matr×r

Let N, K be another two presentations of Q and κ = (κ1, κ2, · · · , κt) and µ = (µ1, µ2, · · · , µk)
be their corresponding Konstant partitions, respectively. It is easy to see by the deﬁnition
that the composition of the following map

HomQ(M, N ) × HomQ(N, K) → HomQ(M, K)

(f, g) 7→ gf

is identiﬁed with the composition of matrices as follow.

HomQ(M, N ) × HomQ(N, K) → HomQ(M, K)

((fi,j), (gi,j)) 7→ (

fi,pgp,j)

t

This mean by the isomorphism Π as in 3.25, we obtain

(3.26)

Π(gf ) = Π(f )Π(g)

Xp=1

If we write N = (W, y) and take an element of b ∈ HomQ(N, τ N ), under this identity, the

map ra,b becomes the following map

(3.27)

Matr×t → Matr×t
f 7→ af − f b

Remark 3.14. Here we assume that there exist no projective indecomposable representations
Pi in the direct summand of M or N . One of the reasons is that we only focus determinantal
modules over the preprojective algebra ΛQ. If there is a projective indecomposable repre-
sentation Pi in the direct summand of a module M , then its corresponding determinantal
M is exactly an injective (and projective ) module over ΛQ. Therefore, we obtain

Lemma 3.15. Let a = (ai,j)i,j∈[1,r] and b = (bi,j)i,j∈[1,t] be two nilpotent matrices such that
ai,i+1 = bj,j+1 = 1 for all i ∈ [1, r] and j ∈ [1, t], and ai,j = bi,j = 0 if i ≥ j. Consider the
subspace Z(a, b) of M atr×t consisting of elements f = (fi,j)i∈[1,r];j∈[1,t] satisfying the equation
af − f b = 0

We have dim Z(a, b) = min{r, t}

Proof. Let us deﬁne the map ra,b : M atr×s → M atr×s by sending f to af − f b. Consider the
condition

ra,b(f ) = af − f b = 0
We consider the composition of matrices as the composition of maps. Let us consider the
paths from i to j. There are two kinds of paths:

and

ai,d→ d

fd,j→ j

fi,s→ s

bs,j→ j

Hence, for a pair (i, j), we have

We remark that here fd,j satisﬁes d ≥ i + 1 and fi,s satisﬁes s < j. Let us ﬁrst show fr,1 = 0.

We will show that

(3.28)

fr,j = 0

except fr,t

by induction on j. Let us assume that fr,k = 0 for any k < j and consider the pair (r, j).
The above equation becomes

We have fr,j = 0, as bj,j+1 = 1.

Similarly, Let us consider the pair (i, 1) for any 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1, we will show that fi,1 = 0

except f1,1 by the induction on i. Let us suppose that fd,1 = 0 for all d > i and consider

we will show that fi,j = 0 if i > j except (r, t). We prove this by induction on d = i − j.
As we discussed before, for d = r − 1 we have fr,1 = 0. Let us assume that fi′,j′ = 0 for all
i′ > j′ and i′ − j′ > i − j, and then consider

The equation d−j ≥ i+1−j > i−j and i−s ≥ i−(j −1) > i−j leads to fd,j = 0 and fi,s = 0
by our assumption. This means ra,b(f )i−1,j = ai−1,ifi,j − fi−1,j−1bj−1,j = fi,j − fi−1,j−1 = 0,
as ai−1,i = bi−1,j−1 = 1. Hence, we obtain fi,j = fi−j+1,1 by repeating the relation
fi,j = fi−1,j−1. However, the relation i > j leads to i − j + 1 > 1, and then implies by
fi,1 = 0 for all i > 1 that fi,j = fi−j+1,1 = 0

Therefore, we get that

Next, we will show that fi,i = fj,j for any i, j ∈ min{s, t}. It is enough to check fi,i =

fi+1,i+1 for all i < min{s, t}. Let us consider

ra,b(f )i,i+1 =ai,i+1fi+1,i+1 − fi,ibi,i+1

=fi+1,i+1 − fi,i = 0

Let us give a tuple (f1,i)i∈[1,t]. We will show that this tuple gives rise to a unique solution of
the equation ra,b(f ) = 0. As above, we see fi,i = f1,1 for all i ≤ min{r, t}. Let k ≤ t − 1, we
will show that fi,i+k is determined by f1,i for i ≤ k. In other words,

fi,i+k ∈ hf1,1, f1,2, · · · f1,k+1i

30

YINGJIN.BI

where hf1,1, f1,2, · · · f1,ki is the subspace generated by f1,1, · · · , f1,k. We show this by induc-
tion on k, we have seen that f1,1 = fi,i for all i ≤ min{s, t}. Let us assume that

fi,i+l ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,l+1i

for any l < k

and then consider

i+k+1

ra,b(f )i,i+k+1 =

Xd>i+1

Xs=i

Since i + k + 1 − d < k and s − i < k, then by our assumption, we get

fd,i+k+1, fi,s ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki

for any d, s in the above equation

Thus, ra,b(f )i,i+k+1 = 0 implies that

fi+1,i+1+k = fi,i+k + bi

where bi ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki.
That means

It implies that fi,i+k = f1,k+1 + ci where ci ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki.

fi,i+k ∈ hf1,1, f1,2, · · · f1,k+1i for any i such that i + k ≤ t

Let us calculate the dimension of Z(a, b). Combining our claims, we have
(1) fr,j = 0 except fr,t;
(2) fi,j = 0 for all i > j;
(3) fi,i+k ∈ hf1,1, · · · f1,ti
If r ≥ t, The condition (1) follows from the condition (2). This means that the tuple

(f1,i)i∈[1,t] is a basis of the equation ra,b(f ) = 0.

If r < t, the condition (1) implies that fr,k = 0 for k ∈ [r, t − 1]. Thus fr,r = 0 leads to
f1,1 = 0. Based on our proof of the condition (3), we see that f1,j = 0 for j ∈ [1, t − r]. Thus,
(cid:3)
(f1,i)i∈[t−r+1,t] is a basis of the equation ra,b(f ) = 0.

Theorem 3.16. Let λ = (λ1, λ2, · · · , λr) ∈ KP(α) and κ = (κ1, κ2, · · · , κt) ∈ KP(β) be two
τ -orbit Konstant partitions. Let a ∈ HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ) and b ∈ HomQ(Mκ, τ Mκ) such that
ai,j = bk,l = 1 if [λi, τ λj] = [κk, τ κk] = 1. Set

Let us consider the map

[p, q] = {k | [λ1.κk] = 1}

ra,b : HomQ(Mλ, Mκ) → HomQ(Mλ, τ Mκ)

We have

(3.29)

dim Ker ra,b =

♯[p, q] if r ≥ t
♯[t − r + 1, t] ∩ [p, q] if r < t

(

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS31

In particular, ra,b is surjective if and only if

(3.30)

[Mλ, Mκ] − [Mλ, τ Mκ] =

♯[p, q] if r ≥ t
♯[t − r + 1, t] ∩ [p, q] if r < t

(

Proof. It is easy to see by the fact λi = τ λi+1 and κk = τ κk+1 that [λi, τ λi+1] = [κk, τ κk+1] =
1 for any i, k. Hence, a, b satisfy the assumption in Lemma (3.15). By Proposition 3.11 and
the deﬁnition of τ -orbit Konstant partitions 3.23, we have {k |
[λ1.κk] = 1} is a segment
[p, q] for some integers p, q.

In the case r ≥ t, Following the above Lemma, we have that (f1,k)k∈[1,t] is a basis for the
equation ra,b = 0. On the other hand, f1,k 6= 0 if and only if k ∈ [p, q]. Hence, we obtain
dim Ker ra,b = ♯[1, t] ∩ [p, q]. Similarly, in the case r < t, we have that (f1,k)k∈[t−r+1,t] is a
(cid:3)
basis for the equation ra,b = 0, then dim Ker ra,b = ♯[t − r + 1, t] ∩ [p, q].

Remark 3.17. We remark that the dimension of kernel of ra,b is uniquely determined by
the number r, t and the root λ1 and κ1. The segment [p, q] in the above theorem can be
calculated using Proposition 3.11.

For simplicity, we denote by lu[a, b] the number of the set [0, u] ∩ [a, b] and by lc

u[a, b] the
number of the complement of the set [0, u] ∩ [a, b] in [0, u]. we always write lu[a, b] for the set
or the number of this set if there is no confusion. For example, we write lu[a, b] ∩ lc
u[c, d] for
the set

[a, b] ∩ [c, d]c ∩ [0, u]

or the number of its elements

|[a, b] ∩ [c, d]c ∩ [0, u]|

where [c, d]c is the complement of [c, d].

For any two roots βa and βb, by Proposition 3.11, we have that

(3.31)

R(βa, βb) =

k ∈ Z | [τ kβa, βb] = 1

is a segment of integers.

Theorem 3.18. Let λ = (τ uβa, · · · , τ βa, βa) and κ = (τ vβb, · · · , τ βb, βb), and put

(3.32)

R(βa, βb) = [s, t]

and

dλ,κ = u − v − 1

we have
[Mλ, Mκ] − [Mλ, τ Mκ] = lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

In particular, ra,b is surjective if and only if

(1) if u ≥ v

Proof. For any i ∈ [0, u], let us set

and

Γi =

j ∈ [0, v] | [τ u−iβa, τ v−j βb] = 1

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

τ Γi =

j ∈ [0, v] | [τ u−iβa, τ v−j+1βb] = 1

j ∈ [0, v] | [τ u−iβa, τ v−(j−1)βb] = 1

(cid:8)

(cid:9)
It is easy to see that we have j + 1 ∈ τ Γi if j ∈ Γi and j 6= v. On the other hand, k − 1 ∈ Γi
if k ∈ τ Γi and k 6= 0. It is easy to see that v ∈ Γi is equivalent to the condition u − i ∈ [s, t].
In other words,

(3.33)
v ∈ Γi ⇐⇒ i ∈ lu[u − t, u − s]
Meanwhile, 0 ∈ τ Γi is equivalent to [τ u−iβa, τ v+1βb] = 1. The Proposition 3.1 implies that
this is identiﬁed with the relation [τ u−i−v−1βa, βb] = 1. Namely, u − v − 1 − i ∈ [s, t]. Hence,
we have

(3.34)

0 ∈ τ Γi ⇐⇒ i ∈ lu[u − v − 1 − t, u − v − 1 − s]

There are four cases:

(1) v ∈ Γi and 0 ∈ τ Γi; then Γi = τ Γi = [0, v], as 1 ∈ τ Γi and v − 1 ∈ Γi;
(2) v ∈ Γi and 0 /∈ τ Γi; then Γi = [a, v] and τ Γi = [a + 1, v] for some a ≥ 0;
(3) v /∈ Γi and 0 ∈ τ Γi; then Γi = [0, b] and τ Γi = [0, b + 1] for some b < v;
(4) v /∈ Γi and 0 /∈ τ Γi; then Γi = [a, b] and τ Γi = [a + 1, b + 1] for some a ≥ 0 and b < v.

Therefore, It follows by 3.33, 3.34, and dλ,κ = u − v − 1 that

[Mλ, Mκ] − [Mλ, τ Mκ]

(3.35)

=♯ {i ∈ [0, u] | v ∈ Γi and 0 /∈ τ Γi} − ♯ {i ∈ [0, u] | v /∈ Γi and 0 ∈ τ Γi}
=lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc
Let us consider the segment [p, q] in Theorem (3.16).

(3.36)

Since

[p, q] =

j ∈ [0, v] | [τ uβa, τ v−j βb] = 1

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

[τ uβa, τ v−j βb] = [τ u−v+jβa, βb]

This means j ∈ [p, q] if and only if u − v + j ∈ [s, t]. Hence, we obtain

(3.37)

[p, q] = [s + v − u, t + v − u] ∩ [0, v] = lv[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1]

Therefore, ra,b is surjective if and only if

(1) if u ≥ v

lv[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1]

=lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

(2) if u < v

lv[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1] ∩ [v − u + 1, v]

=lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

4. Representation theory of preprojective algebras

In this section, we brieﬂy recall some basic notions of preprojective algebras. The goal of
this section is to interpret the properties of modules of preprojective algebras in terms of the
results we obtained before. Thus, the conclusions in this section may be well known in other
papers. We just try to give a new viewpoint to consider these problems.

Let us consider a quiver Q and its opposite quiver Qop. One deﬁnes an algebra ΛQ as a

quotient algebra of k(Q ∪ Qop) by the ideal I which is generated by

for any i ∈ I. We simply denote by Λ

¯hh − h′ ¯h′

Xs(h)=i,t(h′)=i

Next we will recall the notion of rigid modules over Λ. We call the module T a rigid
module if Ext1
Λ(T, T ) = 0. One denotes by AT its endmorphism ring EndΛ(T ) and denote
by ΓT the Gabriel’s quiver of AT . More precisely, the set of vertices of ΓT is [1, r], where r is
the number of indecomposable direct summands of T ; the number of arrows between i and j
is dim ExtAT (Si, Sj). One deﬁnes the antisymmetric matrix

BT = (bi,j)i∈[1,r],j∈[1,n−r] by

(4.4)

bi,j = ♯{arrows i → j in ΓT } − ♯{arrows j → i in ΓT }

e

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let T be a rigid module in Cw. We call T a cluster titling module if
Ext1

Λ(T, X) = 0 implies X ∈ add(T ).

We give some properties of the category Cw as follows.

Proposition 4.3. [11] Let T be a basic cluster tilting module in Cw, one has

Vi is a cluster titling object;

Reinten quiver of Q. More precisely, we will study the Gabriel’s quiver Γi of the algebra
EndΛ(

Vi).

Let Ii be indecomposable injective representations of Q with dimension vector γi for i ∈ I.
The set of indecomposable representations equals {τ kIi | C kγi ∈ R+}. The AR-sequence of
indecomposable representations gives rise to a quiver structure ΓQ of R+. In other words,
τ kIi → τ lIj if there exists an irreducible morphism f : τ kIi → τ lIj. The Auslander-Reiten
sequences are given by

0 → τ k+1Ii →

τ lIj → τ kIi → 0

M(j,l)∼(i,k)

where (j, l) ∼ (i, k) refers to τ lIj such that there exist arrows from τ lIj to τ kIi.

Recall that Section (2.1), a reduced expression i = [i1i2 · · · im] of w0, which is adapted to
Q, gives rise to an ordering on R+ by equation (2.2). In [23] Oh deﬁnes a quiver structure
Υi on R+ as follows.

(4.5)

βk → βl if k > l such that ik ∼ il and there is no k > j > l such that ij ∈ {ik, il}

By [2], we have Υi = ΓQ.

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS35

Recall that the word i as in 2.3 and notations in 2.4.
kmin = min {j < k | ij = ik}.

One deﬁnes a tuple of Konstant partitions

for any k ∈ [1, r], we denote by

β(i) = (β[1min,1], β[2min,2], · · · , β[mmin,m])
We deﬁne a quiver Qi by for any k > l we have β[kmin,k] → β[lmin,l] if and only if there is an
arrow βk → βl in the AR quiver ΓQ or β[kmin,k] → β[kmin,k+].

Following [11, section 9.4] or [5], we deﬁne a quiver Γi as follows. The vertex set of Γi is
equal to [1, m]. For 1 ≤ s < t ≤ m such that is 6= it, there is an arrow s → t if is ∼ it and
s < t < s+ ≤ t+. These are called ordinary arrows. Furthermore, for each s ∈ [1, m], there
is an arrow s → s− if s− > 0. These are horizontal arrows.
Proposition 4.4 ([9, Theorem 1]). Under the above assumption, we have Qop

i = Γi.

Proof. In [9], Geiß, Leclerc and Schr¨oer showed this proposition. Here we will give another
proof. We consider the ordinary arrows and horizontal arrows of Γi respectively. Let us
consider the ordinary arrows: It is easy to see from the word 2.3 that there are n − 1 diﬀerent
letters between k and k+ if k+ 6= ∅. Let h : is → it be an ordinary arrow. The assumption
s < t < s+ ≤ t+ implies that there exits on k such that s < k < t and ik ∈ {is, it}. The
relation is ∼ it implies by 4.5 that βt → βs. This means the subquiver consisting of ordinary
arrows is the opposite quiver of Υi. By [2], we have Υi = ΓQ.

As Qi is obtained from the Auslander-Reiten quiver ΓQ by adding arrows β[kmin,k] →
β[kmin,k+]. It is easy to see that these arrows are exactly the opposite of the horizontal arrows.
Based on our observation, we see that Qop
(cid:3)

i = Γi.

Remark 4.5. The reason we here mention this quiver Γi is that this data will give rise to a
quantum cluster structure on Aq(n(w)) for w ∈ W , (see Section (5.4) or [11] for more details).

4.3. Ringel’s interpretation of the cluster category. In what follows, we assume that
w = w0 and i is (2.3). In the Dynkin case, it is well known that

Cw0

∼= ΛQ − mod

In [24] Ringel gave an interpretation of the category ΛQ − mod via Auslander-Reiten theory
of Q. More precisely, We deﬁne a category DQ by: its objects consist of a pair (M, a) where
M is a representation of Q and a ∈ HomQ(M, τ M ); the morphisms from (M, a) to (N, b)
are the morphisms f in HomQ(M, N ) such that bf = τ (f )a. By Lemma (3.3), we have
HomDQ((M, a), (N, b)) = ker ra,b = HomQ(M, N ) ∩ HomQop(a, b).

Recall that a module

M = (V, x, a) of Λ where x ∈ HomΩ(V, V ) and a ∈ HomΩop(V, V )
x,x(a) = 0, (see 2.30). The Lemma 3.2 implies that there exists a unique element
x,x(f ). Therefore, we can consider a as an element of

such that p∗
f ∈ HomQ(M, τ M ) such that a = e∗
HomQ(M, τ M ) via e∗

f

x,x. This proves that DQ ∼= ΛQ − mod.
There is a canonical functor Ψ : DQ → kQ − mod by sending (M, a) to M .

Deﬁnition 4.6. Let M be a representation of Q. We deﬁne M τ +
indecomposable representation Mβ of Q. Similarly, we deﬁne M τ −

β = ⊕k∈Nτ kMβ for an

β = ⊕k∈Nτ −kMβ.

Next, Let us deﬁne the following category:

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let us deﬁne Dw0 by the category consisting of representations M of Q such
that

0 → T ′ → T → M → 0
where T ′, T ∈ add(Vi). It is easy to see Dw0 = kQ − mod.

Following [24], we have the following Theorem:

Theorem 4.8. There is a functor Ψw : ΛQ − mod → kQ − mod by sending
M = (V, x). Moreover, the following conditions hold:

M = (V, x, a) to

T = (T, T ∗) is a rigid module over ΛQ if and only if Ext1

Let us consider T in

Therefore, it is easy to see that

AutΛ(

Gα-action to AutQ(T ) is given by

e

g · (T, T ∗) = (T, g · T ∗) for all g ∈ AutQ(T )

Therefore, we see that the center of T ∗ in AutQ(T ) is identiﬁed with

On the other hand, if Ext1

α at M ′ = (V, a) ∈ Eα is equal to HomQop(M ′, τ M ′).

Lemma 4.10. [24] The ﬁber of the canonical map π : Λα → Eα at M = (V, x) ∈ Eα is

a,a([x, f ])

[x, f ] is Lie bracket on Homk(V, V )

assume that the word i as (2.3). Following Section (4.1) and Section (4.3), we will calculate
the extension groups of the determinantal modules
V [c, d]. In Section (4.3), we
see that the Konstant partitions corresponding to determinantal modules are of the form

For a τ -orbit Konstant partition λ = (τ uβ, · · · , β), let us recall the notion of the dual module
M ∗
Mλ by 2.7, it is an element of a ∈ HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ) such that dim Oa is maximal with
respect to all a′ ∈ HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ). By 3.25, we see that any element of HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ)
are nilpotent matrices in Mat(u+1)×(u+1).

f

Recall that the GLu+1-orbits of nilpotent matrices are classiﬁed by the blocks of Jor-
dan matrices.
the nilpotent matrices with maximal dimensional GLu+1-orbits are called
It
regular nilpotent matrices, namely, ai,i+1 = 1 for all i and aij = 0 for any i > j.
is well known that the center ZGLu+1(a) of a regular matrix a is contained in the center
ZGLu+1(a′) of each nilpotent element a′ ∈ HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ). Since AutQ(Mλ) is regarded
as a subgroup of GLu+1, then ZAutQ(Mλ)(a) = AutQ(Mλ) ∩ ZGLu+1(a). This implies by
dim Oa = dim AutQ(Mλ) − dim ZAutQ(Mλ)(a) that the elements of HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ) with
maximal dimension of AutQ(Mλ) are precisely the regular nilpotent matrices if there is a
regular nilpotent matrix in HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ).

Lemma 2.3 implies that any regular element of HomQ(Mλ, τ Mλ) has the same dimension

of AutQ(Mλ)-orbit. Therefore, we can take a = M ∗

λ as

ai,j 6= 0 if HomQ(τ u−iMλ, τ τ u−jMλ) 6= 0

we see the following theorem.

This implies lc

u[1 − nβ, 1] = [0, u]. On the other hand,

In order to show that rλ,λ is surjective, we just prove the following formula:

it is straight to see this equation.

We have

dim ker rλ,τ λ = lu[s − dλ,τ λ − 1, t − dλ,τ λ − 1] = lu[1, nβ + 1]

On the other hand, this implies

lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] = lu[−nβ − 2, −2] = ∅ and lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] = [0, u].

lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

If u − nβ − 1 ≥ 0, this term is equal to

♯[u − nβ − 1, u − 1] = nβ + 1 = lu[1, nβ + 1] = ker rλ.τ λ

It implies that rλ,τ λ is surjective.

If u − nβ − 1 < 0, this term is equal to

This follows that rλ,τ λ is surjective

♯[0, u − 1] = u = lu[1, nβ + 1] = [1, u]

Let us consider rτ λ,λ. It is easy to see that

If u ≥ nβ, then lu[u − nβ + 1, u + 1] = [u − nβ + 1, u], lc
then (4.23) is equal to

u[u − nβ + 1, u + 1] ∩ [0]

u[u − nβ + 1, u + 1] = [0, u − nβ], and

♯[u − nβ + 1, u] ∩ [1, u] − [0, u − nβ] ∩ [0] = nβ − 1

On the other hand, u ≥ nβ implies that dim ker rτ λ,λ = lu[−1, nβ − 1] = nβ. This means
(4.24)

dim ker rτ λ,λ = nβ > [Mτ λ,λ, Mτ λ,λ] − [Mτ λ,λ, Mτ λ,τ λ] = nβ − 1

That is: coker rτ λ,λ = 1.

Let us consider tha case u ≤ nβ − 1. lu[u − nβ + 1, u + 1] = [0, u], lc

u[u − nβ + 1, u + 1] = ∅,

and then (4.23) is equal to

♯[0, u] ∩ [1, u] = ♯[1, u] = u

The relation u ≤ nβ − 1 implies that
(4.25)

dim ker rτ λ,λ = lu[−1, nβ − 1] = [0, u] = u + 1 > u

This implies that coker rτ λ,λ = 1.

Considering the above discussion, we see that rλ,τ λ is surjective and the dimension of

cokernel of rτ λ,λ is equal to 1. It follows by Proposition (4.13) that

Following [11, Lemma 5.2], we have
Corollary 4.17. Given two τ -orbit Konstant partition λ = (τ uβ, · · · , β) and κ = (τ uα, · · · , α)

Proof. We assume that β > α. Let us consider the map rλ,κ. It is easy to see by Proposi-
tion (3.11) that

dλ,κ = −1 and [s, t] = [0, na,b]

dim ker rλ,κ = lu[s − dλ,κ − 1, t − dλ,κ − 1] = lu[0, na,b]

This implies that

Since

lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] = lu[−1 − na,b, −1] = ∅

we see that lc
implies that [Mλ, Mκ] − [Mλ, τ Mκ] equals

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] = [0, u]. On the other hand, lu[u − t, u − s] = lu[u − na,b, u]

u[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dλ,κ − t, dλ,κ − s]

lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc
=lu[u − na,b, u] ∩ [0, u]
=lu[u − na,b, u]

It is easy to see that ♯[u − na,b, u] ∩ [0, u] = ♯[0, na,b] ∩ [0, u]. It follows by Theorem (3.18)
that rλ,κ is surjective.

Let us consider rκ,λ, Since

It is easy to see that

dκ,λ = −1 and [s, t] = [1, nb,a],

dim ker rκ,λ = lu[s − dκ,λ − 1, t − dκ,λ − 1] = lu[1, nb,a]

The equation

lu[dκ,λ − t, dκ,λ − s] = lu[−1 − nb,a, −2] = ∅

u[dκ,λ − t, dκ,λ − s] = [0, u]. On the other hand, lu[u − t, u − s] = lu[u − nb,a, u − 1]

implies that lc
implies that [Mκ, Mλ] − [Mκ, τ Mλ] is equal to
lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[dκ,λ − t, dκ,λ − s] − lc

(4.27)

=lu[u − nb,a, u − 1] ∩ [0, u]

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[dκ,λ − t, dκ,λ − s]

If u ≥ nb,a, then lu[u − nb,a, u − 1] ∩ [0, u] = ♯[u − nb,a, u − 1] = nb,a. On the other hand,
u ≥ nb,a implies that dim ker rκ,λ = lu[1, nb,a] = nb,a = [Mκ, Mλ] − [Mκ, τ Mλ].

If u ≤ nb,a, then lu[u − nb,a, u − 1] ∩ [0, u] = ♯[0, u − 1] = u. On the other hand, u ≤ nb,a

implies by 4.27 that

dim ker rκ,λ = lu[1, nb,a] = ♯[1, u] = u = [Mκ, Mλ] − [Mκ, τ Mλ]

It follows that the module

Mλ = (Mλ, a) satisfying ai,i+1 = 1 for any i ∈ [1, r − 1]. Let κ

Recall the proof of Lemma 3.15, for any (i, i + k), we have

fi,i+k = f1,k+1 + ci

f

where ci ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki.
If there exists an i such that [[ai, bi], [ci+k, di+k]] = 0, then
fi,i+k = 0. The above equation implies that f1,k+1 ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki. Hence, for any j 6= i, the
equation fj,j+k = f1,k+1 + cj where cj ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki implies that fj,j+k ∈ hf1,1, · · · , f1,ki.
Hence, we set

(4.29)

T (λ, κ) = {k ∈ [1, t] | [[ai, bi], [ci+k−1, di+k−1]] 6= 0 for all i ∈ [1, r]}
The above discussion implies that for any k /∈ T (λ, κ) the f1,k belongs to the subspace
generated by f1,1, f1,2, · · · , f1,k−1. Therefore, it follows by Theorem (3.16) that

(4.30)

dim Ker rλ,κ =

♯T (λ, κ) if r ≥ t
♯[t − r + 1, t] ∩ T (λ, κ) if r < t

(

We remark that this doesn’t happen in the case of τ -orbit Konstant partitions, as

[λi, κi+k] = [τ u−iλi, τ u−iκi+k] = [λ1, κk]

Following [14, Section 6.3], let us set

Xλ,κ = {(i, j) ∈ [1, r] × [1, t] | [[ai, bi], [cj + 1, dj + 1]] = 1}
Yλ,κ = {(i, j) ∈ [1, r] × [1, t] | [[ai, bi], [cj , dj]] = 1}

DETERMINANTAL MODULES OVER PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRAS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNKIN QUIVERS45

We remark that the notion of Xλ,κ and Yλ,κ in [14, Section 6.3] uses the relation [ai, bi] ≺
[cj, dj]. Therefore, ra,b is surjective if and only if

(4.31)

♯Yλ,κ − ♯Xλ,κ =

♯T (λ, κ) if r ≥ t
♯[t − r + 1, t] ∩ T (λ, κ) if r < t

(

By Proposition (3.5), there are four cases for any pair (i, j):

[[ai, bi], [cj , dj]] = 1 and [[ai, bi], [cj + 1, dj + 1]] = 1;
[[ai, bi], [cj , dj]] = 0 and [[ai, bi], [cj + 1, dj + 1]] = 0
[[ai, bi], [cj , dj]] = 0 and [[ai, bi], [cj + 1, dj + 1]] = 1;
[[ai, bi], [cj , dj]] = 1 and [[ai, bi], [cj + 1, dj + 1]] = 0

We don’t need consider the ﬁrst two cases, as they don’t change the number ♯Yλ,κ − ♯Xλ,κ.
Therefore, we just consider the last two case. Namely, [cj, dj] ∪ [ai, bi] = [cj, bi] and [ai, bi] −
[cj, dj] ∈ R. The ﬁrst relation means that dj + 1 = ai; the second relation means ai = cj, bi ≥
dj or ai > cj, bi = dj.

Therefore, we obtain

♯Yλ,κ − ♯Xλ,κ

=♯ {(i, j) | ai = cj, bi ≥ dj or ai > cj, bi = dj} − ♯ {(i, j) | ai = dj + 1}

Therefore, Theorem (3.16) implies that ra,b is surjective if and only if

♯ {(i, j) | ai = cj, bi ≥ dj or ai > cj, bi = dj} − ♯ {(i, j) | ai = dj + 1}

In this section we will brieﬂy recall some basic notions of quantum groups. Recall Cartan
matrix CQ associated with a quiver Q (see 1.10). Let us denote by P ∨ the coweight lattice.
one deﬁnes a quantum group Uq(g) as an algebra over Q(q) generated by ei ; fi ; qh where

for any α ∈ Q. It is easy to see that Uq(g)0 is generated by qh for all h ∈ P ∨. We remark
that here we use q for all i ∈ I rather than qi, as in Dynkin cases qi = q for all i ∈ I. We
have the root decomposition as follows.

5.1. Quantum groups. Here is a list of operations on Uq(n):
(1) (bar involution): ei = ei; q = q−1; (Anti-involution) e∗
(2) Set the product on Uq(n) ⊗ Uq(n) by

i = ei and (xy)∗ = y∗x∗.

(x1 ⊗ y1)(x2 ⊗ y2) = q−(wt(x2),wt(y1))x1x2 ⊗ y1y2

(3) r : Uq(n) → Uq(n) ⊗ Uq(n) is a algebraic map given by r(ei) = 1 ⊗ ei + ei ⊗ 1. We call

it twist coproduct.

(4) (Lusztig’s bilinear form) Set (−, −)L : Uq(n)α × Uq(n)α → Q(q) by

• (1, 1)L = 1; (ei; ej)L = δi,j
• (xy, z)L = (x ⊗ y, r(z))L; (z, xy)L = (r(z), x ⊗ y)L.

Canonical bases. Following [21], we review the canonical bases B of Uq(n). For a α ∈ Q+
let Qα be the semisimple category generated by Lusztig’s sheaves Li for i ∈ hIiα. Denote by
Pα the subset of Qα consisting of simple perverse sheaves in Qα, (see [21] or [25] for these
notions). Here is a key theorem in quantum groups.
Theorem 5.1. [[21];[25]] There is an isomorphism between K0(Qα) ∼= Uq(n)α for any α ∈
def.
Q+. Under the Induction and Restriction functors on K0(Q)
= ⊕α∈Q+K0(Qα), one obtains
an algebraic isomorphism Φ : K0(Q) ∼= Uq(n). We call b ∈ Uq(n)α a canonical base if
b = Φ(IC) for some IC ∈ Pα. Denote by B the set of canonical bases.

Remark 5.2. In the Dynkin case, Pα is exactly the set of simple perverse sheaves IC(λ) where
λ runs over all the Konstant partitions KP(α). This means we can index canonical bases
using Konstant partitions. In what follows, we denote by bλ the canonical base associated
with λ ∈ KP(α) for an element α ∈ Q+.

5.2. Quantum unipotent groups. Following [20] and [13], we deﬁne

Deﬁnition 5.3. Set

Aq(n) = {u ∈ Uq(n) | (u, v)K ∈ A for all v ∈ Uq(n).}

and

We call B∗ the set of dual canonical bases. We remark that Aq(n) can be considered as a
quantum coordinate ring of nilpotent subgroup N with Lie algebra n, (see [11]).

(cid:9)

Here is the list of properties of Aq(n) and B∗.
(1) There is an isomorphism as follows.

(2) σ(b∗) = b∗ for any b∗ ∈ B∗.

Let us recall the quantum nilpotent groups. Give a Weyl element w ∈ W and ﬁx a reduced
expression of w as in Section (2.1), let us consider the roots R(w) associated with w. For any
β ∈ R(w) one deﬁnes the root base F (β) ∈ Uq(n)β as in [13, Section 4.3]. We remark that
here we consider the positive part of Uq(g) rather than the negative part as in that paper.
One sets

KP(α)w = {λ ∈ KP(α) | λi ∈ R(w) for all λi}
For any Konstant partition λ = (λ1, λ2, · · · , λr) ∈ KP(α)w we deﬁne F (λ) = F (λ1) · · · F (λr).

Deﬁnition 5.4. [21, Proposition 40.2.1]; or[11] Deﬁne Uq(n(w)) by an algebra generated by
root bases F (β) for all β ∈ R(w). The set of F (λ) for all λ ∈ KP(α) form a basis of this
algebra, which is called PBW basis. Deﬁne

Let us recall the notion of unipotent quantum minors du(ωi),v(ωi) where ωi refers to the

si(ωj) = ωj if i 6= j).

(2) For the word (2.3), we have the Konstant partition λ(b, d) for D(b, d) is

(βd, βd− , · · · , βk, · · · , βb)

where βk run over the root of the form si1si2 · · · sil−1(αil) such that il = id and
b ≤ l ≤ d. It follows by 2.4 that

for some integer u, which is a τ -orbit Konstant partition.

λ(b, d) = (τ uβb = βa, · · · , βb)

l(b, d) = l(λ(b, d)). In other words, l(b, d) = u + 1 if λ(b, d) = (τ uβb = βd, · · · , βb). Following

Theorem 5.7. Let D(b, d) and D(k, l) be two quantum minors induced from the word (2.3).
Let us write λ(b, d) = (τ uβb = βd, · · · , βb) and λ(k, l) = (τ vβk = βl, · · · , βk). Set
(5.10) R(βb, βk) = [s, t], R(βk, βb) = [s′, t′], and d(b,d),(k,l) = u − v − 1, d(k,l),(b,d) = v − u − 1
we have D(b, d)D(k, l) is a dual canonical base in Aq(n(w)) (up to q-power scaling) if and
only if they satisfy the following condition

(1) if u = v

lu[s, t] = lu[u − t, u − s] ∩ lc

u[−1 − t, −1 − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[−1 − t, −1 − s]

and

lu[s′, t′] = lu[u − t′, u − s′] ∩ lc
(2) if u 6= v and we assume that u > v,

u[−1 − t′, −1 − s′] − lc

u[u − t′, u − s′] ∩ lu[−1 − t′, −1 − s′]

lv[s − d(b,d),(k,l) − 1, t − d(b,d),(k,l) − 1]

and

u[d(b,d),(k,l) − t, d(b,d),(k,l) − s] − lc

u[u − t, u − s] ∩ lu[d(b,d),(k,l) − t, d(b,d),(k,l) − s]

lu[s′ − d(k,l),(b,d) − 1, t′ − d(k,l),(b,d) − 1] ∩ [u − v + 1, u]
v[d(k,l),(b,d) − t′, d(k,l),(b,d) − s′] − lc

v[v − t′, v − s′] ∩ lv[d(k,l),(b,d) − t′, d(k,l),(b,d) − s′]

More generally, let Z1 and Z2 be two quantum cluster monomials in Aq(n) with respect to
a cluster (X1, X2, · · · , Xr) and (Y1, Y2, · · · , Yr) respectively such that each Xi and Yj are
quantum minors. Using this theorem, one can check the following condition

Z1Z2 = qnZ2Z1

Theorem 5.8. Let a = (a1, a2, · · · , ar) and b = (b1, b2, · · · , bt) be two tuples of positive
integers, and let Z1 = X a and Z2 = Y b be two quantum cluster monomials in Aq(n) with
respect to the clusters (X1, X2, · · · , Xr) and (Y1, Y2, · · · , Yr) such that all Xi and Yj are
