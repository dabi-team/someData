Abstract

The advancement of Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector technology oﬀers us
diﬀerent kinds of detectors with good spatial resolution and high rate ca-
pability and the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector is one of them.
Typically GEM is made up of a thin polyimide foil having a thickness of 50
micrometers with 5 micrometers copper cladding on top and bottom sides.
The presence of polyimide changes the gain of the detector under the inﬂu-
ence of external radiation and the phenomenon is referred to as the charging
up eﬀect. The charging up eﬀect is investigated with a double mask triple
GEM detector prototype with Ar/CO2 gas mixture in 70/30 ratio under con-
tinuous irradiation from a strong Fe55 X-ray source. The detailed method
of measurements and the test results are presented in this article.

1 Introduction

Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is one of the most advanced detectors of the
Micro Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) group [1, 2]. GEM is widely used in
many High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments as a tracking device because
of its good position resolution due to its micro pattern structure [3, 4, 5, 6].

The high rate handling capability of the GEM detector makes it a suitable
candidate for the experiments where large particle ﬂux is expected [7]. GEM
is made up of a thin Kapton foil of thickness 50 µm with 5 µm copper
cladding on sides of the foil. A large number of holes are etched on the
Kapton using the photolithographic technique [8].

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the Charging up eﬀect inside a GEM
hole. EP olarised indicates the electric ﬁeld generated due to the dielectric
polarisation. EExternal indicates the electric ﬁeld generated due to the ex-
ternal high voltage and EInternal indicates the electric ﬁeld generated due to
the accumulation of the charges on the kapton wall.

The holes in a standard GEM foil have an outer and inner diameter of
70 µm and 50 µm respectively. The distance between the centers of two
neighboring holes, that is the pitch, is 140 µm. To create an electric ﬁeld
inside the holes, an external high voltage (HV) is applied between the copper
layers. The holes in the GEM foil act as the multiplication region for the
incoming electrons. As shown in Fig. 1 usually voltage is applied in such
a way that the top of the GEM foil is at negative potential compared to
the bottom plane and the electrons move downwards. The electrode placed
above the top layer of GEM foil is called the drift electrode or drift plane and
the gap between the drift plane and top of the GEM foil is called the drift
region. An incoming charged particle produces primary electrons mainly in
the drift region. These primary electrons are focussed towards the GEM
holes by the electric ﬁeld. The high electric ﬁeld inside the holes enforces
the electrons to multiply by an avalanche. Several GEM layers can be used
in cascade mode to attain high gain without increasing the biasing voltage
and consequently the discharge probability of the chamber [9, 10].

The presence of the Kapton foil inside the active part of the detector
changes its behavior when exposed to external radiation. Due to the high
electric ﬁeld (∼ kV /cm) inside the GEM holes, the incoming electrons get
suﬃcient kinetic energy to start an avalanche of further ionization. Due to
the dielectric properties of the polyimide (Kapton), they get polarised by
the external electric ﬁeld. During this multiplication process, the electrons
and ions may diﬀuse to the polyimide surface and due to the polarisation
of the polyimide by the external HV, the ions or electrons can be captured

2

on the wall of the Kapton foil. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Due to the high resistivity of the Kapton, the charges remain there for a
rather long time. As a result of suﬃcient accumulation of charge on the
wall, the electric ﬁeld conﬁguration inside the hole changes dynamically
and this phenomenon is known as the charging up eﬀect. The accumulated
charges on the surface of the Kapton foil increase the ﬁeld inside the holes
and as a result, the gain of the chamber increases with time. Many studies
have reported that the charging up eﬀect is responsible for a time-dependent
change in gain, which asymptotically reaches a constant value [11, 12, 13, 14].
In this article, a systematic investigation of the charging up process with
diﬀerent irradiation rates in a triple GEM detector prototype built using
double mask foils operated with Ar/CO2 gas mixture in the 70/30 volume
ratio is reported. A strong Fe55 source is used to irradiate as well as to record
the 5.9 keV X-ray spectra from the chamber. The details of the detector
setup are described in Sec. 2 and the results are discussed in Sec. 3.

2 Detector description and experimental setup

In this study, a triple GEM detector prototype, consisting of 10 cm × 10 cm
double mask GEM foils, obtained from CERN is used. The drift, transfer,
and induction gaps of the chamber are kept at 3 mm, 2 mm, and 2 mm
respectively (3-2-2-2 conﬁguration).

Figure 2: Schematic of the HV distribution of the triple GEM chamber.
The drift gap, transfer gap and induction gaps are kept at 3 mm, 2 mm,
and 2 mm respectively.

The HV to the drift plane and individual GEM planes are applied through
a voltage dividing resistor chain. 10 MΩ protection resistors are applied to
the drift plane and top of each GEM foil. A schematic of the resistor chain
and diﬀerent gaps of the chamber is shown in Fig, 2. The readout of the
chamber is made up of nine pads of dimension 9 mm × 9 mm each. The

and a single input is fed to a charge sensitive preampliﬁer (VV50-2) [15].
The gain of the preampliﬁer is 2 mV/fC with a shaping time of 300 ns.
A NIM based data acquisition system is used to process the signals from
the preampliﬁer. The output signal from the preampliﬁer is fed to a linear
Fan-in-Fan-out (linear FIFO) module. One analog signal from the linear
FIFO is put to a Single Channel Analyser (SCA) to measure the rate of the
incident particle. The SCA is operated in integral mode and the lower level
in the SCA is used as the threshold to the signal. The threshold is set at
0.1 V to reject the noise. The discriminated signal from the SCA, which is
TTL in nature, is put to a TTL-NIM adapter and the output NIM signal is
counted using a NIM scaler. The count rate of the detector in Hz is then
calculated. Another output of the linear FIFO is fed to a Multi-Channel
Analyser (MCA) to obtain the energy spectra. A schematic representation
of the electronics set-up is shown in Fig. 3.

Pre-mixed Ar/CO2 gas in a 70/30 volume ratio is used for the whole
study. A constant gas ﬂow rate of 3.5 l/hr is maintained using a V¨ogtlin gas
ﬂow meter. Perspex, aluminium and G-10 collimators having diﬀerent hole
diameters are used to irradiate the chamber with diﬀerent X-ray ﬂux com-
ing from the Fe55 source. The ambient temperature, pressure, and relative
humidity are monitored continuously using a data logger, built-in house [16].

3 Results

The 5.9 keV peak of the Fe55 energy spectrum obtained from the MCA is
ﬁtted with a Gaussian distribution to obtain the gain of the chamber. A
typical Fe55 energy spectrum at - 4.2 kV is shown in Fig. 4. The applied

the drift ﬁeld, transfer ﬁeld, and induction ﬁeld of 2.3 kV/cm, 3.5 kV/cm,
and 3.5 kV/cm respectively.

Figure 4: Typical Fe55 spectra obtained at a HV of - 4.2 kV and irradiated
with 10 kHz X-ray on 50 mm2 area . The Main peak is ﬁtted with a Gaussian
distribution (red line) to calculate the gain of the chamber.

The amount of the input charge is calculated by assuming the full energy
deposition of the 5.9 keV X-ray in the 3 mm drift gap of the chamber. The
number of primary electrons for Ar/CO2 in the 70/30 ratio is 212. The ratio
of the output charge to the input charge gives the gain of the chamber. The
details of the gain calculation and long-term behavior of the chamber were
reported earlier [17, 19]. The variation of the gain as a function of time
for three diﬀerent rates of the incoming X-rays, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 90 kHz
respectively along with the ratio of ambient temperature (T) to pressure (p)
are shown in the top (a), middle (b) and bottom (c) plot of Fig. 5. Using
collimators, X-rays of rates 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 90 kHz are made to fall on
13 mm2, 50 mm2 and 28 mm2 area of the chamber, which implies particle
ﬂux of 0.08 kHz/mm2, 0.2 kHz/mm2 and 3.2 kHz/mm2 respectively. All the
measurements are carried out at an HV of - 4.2 kV.

Since it is well known that the gain of any gaseous detector depends on
temperature and pressure [20], that is why the variation in T/p is plotted
along with the gain as a function of time. The HV is kept OFF for 180
minutes, 60 minutes, and 8 minutes before the measurement is started with
1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 90 kHz X-ray rates respectively. In all three cases, the
data taking starts immediately after the HV is switched ON and the source
is placed on the active area of the detector. The energy spectra are stored
at an interval of 10 minutes for 1 kHz and 10 kHz rates and 3 minutes for

The same Fe55 source is used to irradiate
the chamber as well as to obtain the spectra. From Fig. 5, it is evident
that the gain decreases for the ﬁrst few minutes and then increases for a few
hours of operation and reaches a saturation asymptotically. The decrease in
the initial gain may be due to the loss of the primary electrons(/ions) which
are stuck on the polarised dielectric (Kapton) surface. Since the polarisation
of the dielectric medium itself takes some ﬁnite time that is why whenever
the HV and irradiation started simultaneously, an initial decrease in gain is
observed. Afterward, the gain increases sharply for the ﬁrst few hours due
to the lensing eﬀect created by the accumulated charges on the wall of the
Kapton foil because this eﬀect increases the electric ﬁeld strength inside the
GEM hole. The absolute gain values after saturation are not the same for
all the cases due to the diﬀerent source positions. The variation in gain over
the active area of the particular chamber is reported earlier [18] and it was
found that there was a variation of ∼10% (RMS). For all the measurements,
the gain shows a saturation followed by an initial increase. The gain is
normalised further to eliminate the T/p dependence on the gain. For the
T/p normalisation, data obtained after ∼360 minutes of operation (i.e. the
saturated gain value) is used where only the T/p eﬀect is dominant on the
gain variation. The method of normalisation is discussed in Ref [17]. The
normalised gain is ﬁtted with an exponential function of the form [21]

G = p0(1 − p1e(−t/p2))

(1)

where G is the normalised gain, p0 & p1 are the constants, t is the measure-
ment time in hours, and p2 is the time constant of the charging-up eﬀect,
taking analogy from the charging up mechanism of any RC network [22].

The ﬁtted normalised gain is shown in Fig. 6 for the 1 kHz (top),
10 kHz (middle) and 90 kHz (bottom) X-ray irradiation rates. For the
ﬁtting, the ﬁrst ∼20 minutes are excluded because that includes both the
eﬀect of dielectric polarisation and charging up. After that, the charging
up eﬀect is dominant and is ﬁtted with equation 1 to get an idea about
the time constant of the charging up eﬀect. In Fig. 5 (b), a small change is
visible in the trend of increasing gain from 1-2 hours along the time axis and
that is due to the two opposite eﬀects namely charging-up and T/p varia-
tion. The charging-up process will tend to increase the gain and decrease in
T/p will tend to reduce the gain. As a result of these two competing pro-
cesses, the slope of the curve changes, and that is also reﬂected in Fig. 6 (b).
This competing eﬀect between the charging-up and T/p is distinct in Fig. 7
where 1 kHz X-rays irradiation 13 mm2 area of the GEM chamber. For this
measurement, the high voltage is switched ON, the source is placed on the
detector, and data-taking is started. Before that, the HV is kept OFF for ∼
60 minutes. The ﬁrst three points in Fig. 7 (a) show a decreasing trend in
the gain which is a combined eﬀect of T/p and dielectric polarisation. After

crease in the gain. That is due to the two competing processes, the eﬀect of
the decreasing T/p and charging-up on the gain is anti-correlated. Then af-
ter ∼1.5 hr, the gain increases because of the charging-up and T/p variation.
The corresponding normalised gain variation is shown in Fig. 7 (b).

To identify whether the decrease in the gain at the ﬁrst few minutes is
due to dielectric polarisation or not, a diﬀerent measurement is performed
by keeping the HV ON for ∼24 hours before the ﬁrst measurement. The HV
is kept at - 4.1 kV which corresponds to ∆V ∼ 382 V across each GEM foil
and drift ﬁeld, transfer ﬁeld, and induction ﬁeld of 2.3 kV/cm, 3.4 kV/cm
and 3.4 kV/cm respectively. The chamber is irradiated with 1 kHz X-ray
falling on 13 mm2 area of the chamber. Once the source is placed, the mea-
surement is started immediately. The variation of gain, T/p, and normalised
gain is shown as a function of time in Fig. 8 (a) and (b) respectively. The
data is stored at an interval of 10 minutes. It is evident from the plot that
there is no decrease in gain is observed at the beginning.

Since the charging-up process is due to the accumulation of the charges
on the GEM holes therefore the charging-up process depends on the ﬂux
of incident radiation. More the ﬂux of the incident particle faster will be
the charging-up eﬀect and the same behavior also appears from this study.
From Fig. 6, for 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 90 kHz operations, the time constant of
the charging-up eﬀect is found to be 2.376 + 0.02 hours, 1.524 + 0.008 and
1.395 + 0.004 hours respectively. The time constant of charging-up eﬀect
obtained from Fig. 7 (b), agrees well with 6 (a). From Fig. 8 (b), the time
constant of the charging-up eﬀect is found to be 3.294 + 0.018 for 1 kHz
X-ray. The time constant of charging-up eﬀect obtained from 8 (b) can not
be compared with Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. 7 (b) because the HV is diﬀerent. The
residual voltage dependence on the charging-up eﬀect is also seen in Ref [21].

4 Summary and Outlook

The charging-up eﬀect of a double mask triple GEM prototype is studied
using diﬀerent irradiation rates from a Fe55 X-ray source. The chamber is
operated with Ar/CO2 gas mixture in a 70/30 volume ratio. The HV is
kept OFF for a few minutes to several hours before starting the respective
measurements. The data is stored just after the HV is ON and the source
is placed on the chamber to see the eﬀect of dielectric polarisation on the
gain of the chamber. It is observed that the gain initially decreases and then
increases to reach a saturation value. To ensure the decrease in the gain of
the chamber during the ﬁrst few minutes is due to dielectric polarisation,
a diﬀerent set of measurements is performed where the HV is kept ON for
∼24 hours before the data taking. No initial decrease in gain is observed in
that case as shown in Fig. 8 because the dielectric (i.e. Kapton) is already

11

polarised due to the application of HV beforehand. With diﬀerent particle
ﬂuxes, the time constant of the charging up eﬀect is investigated. It is found
that the charging-up time decreases with increasing particle ﬂux. Though
the time constant value is decreasing with increasing particle ﬂux, the exact
scaling of the time constant with particle ﬂux is not possible because we are
observing an overall eﬀect due to the three GEM foils and it is very diﬃcult
to disentangle the eﬀects of each GEM foil on the ﬁnal results. Also since
the charging up time depends on the GEM hole geometry, properties of the
Kapton foil, charge density in the GEM holes, etc, therefore we can only
conclude that the time constant of the charging up eﬀect decreases with
increasing particle ﬂux. The two competing eﬀects of T/p variation and
charging-up on the gain the chamber is studied by recording the 5.9 keV
Fe55 X-ray spectra and as expected it is coming to be anti-correlated as
shown in Fig. 7. The dependence of the charging-up process on the gain
of the detector, electric ﬁeld strengths of diﬀerent layers, used gas mixture,
and also on the diﬀerent kinds of GEM foils is under investigation.
