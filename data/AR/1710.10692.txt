Abstract: In this text, we establish the risk model based on AR(1) series and propose the basic model
which has a dependent structure under intensity of claim number. Considering some properties of the
risk model, we take advantage of newton iteration method to ﬁgure out the adjustment coeﬃcient and
estimate the exponential upper bound of ruin probability. This is signiﬁcant to reﬁne the research of ruin
theory. As a result, our theory will help develop insurance industry stably.

1 Introduction

[2]

The ruin probability was born in the last century, dating back to the doctoral dissertation which was
proposed by a Sweden actuary in 1903. Basically, his work laid the foundation of our modern random
model towards the non-life ﬁeld. Nevertheless, the results made by Lundberg were not correspond
to strict standard in Mathematics, as a result, statisticians, mathematicians and employees in ﬁnancial
industry, including many stake holders have been working on ﬁguring out a more speciﬁc model which
is much more suitable and precise in a modern circumstance throughout history. With the guidance of
classical risk model, people have achieved many precious results, from the theory made by Lundberg
, who applied strict mathematical tool to ﬁgure out the initial value of θ(0), which has been
to Cramer
1+θ . Also, the inequation φ(u) ≤ e−Ru which corresponds to the Lundberg inequality
proved to be Φ(0) = 1
and Lundberg-Cramer inequation is one of the achievements. Every coin has two sides and this is not
an exception as well. Classical model like this is far too complex, ideal and unsuitable for the modern
situation which is ﬂexible and changeable. It ˛a´rs too numerous to mention one by one as modern risk
researched into the condition when premiums depend on claims and
theories spring up quickly. Wang
estimated the ruin probability under
put forward the exponential upper bound of ruin probability. Fu
proposed a risk model
the condition of renewal risk model depending on time series. Meanwhile, Bao
in speciﬁc ﬁeld where is a Poisson process. Also, Joe
researched into one model of applying
the Copula function into the risk process of Erlang, and ﬁnally achieved the integral diﬀerential equation
of the ﬁnal ruin probability. Lee
takes advantage of several models in time series (AR(p) model, MA(q)
model, ARMA(p, q) model and so on), analyzing ruin probability from three main areas: collecting
quantities every unit time, claiming quantities and interests. Additionally, Chen
discussed the ﬁnal ruin
probability where compound-Poisson distribution is applied in constant interest , achieving the visible
answer of ﬁnal ruin probability where several settlement of claims are under the exponential distribution

formula for the ﬁnite-time ruin probability of a nonstandard risk model with a constant interest rate. Cai

probabilities are derived by a renewal recursive technique and the rates of interest are assumed to have a

independent strong subexponential claim sizes and widely lower orthant dependent inter-occurrence
times. Lefevre

The eﬀects of timing of payments and interest on the ruin problems in the models are studied. The
rates of interest are assumed to have an autoregressive structure. Fu

renewal risk model, in which the claim sizes and inter-arrival times form a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random pairs, with each pair obeying a dependence structure. Li

sense of minimizing the asymptotic ruin probability. Yao

which dependent structures of the payments and the interest force are considered. Hansjorg Albrecher

In the classical model, the number of claims, which is deﬁned as N, is an integer. The quantitative
analysis of current insurance industry is always based on the assumption that the claims form a sequence
of independent identically distributed random variables, and they have nothing to do with time. However
the assumption is not in the line of actual. In fact, a claim in a speciﬁc insurance policy will be inﬂuenced
by the previous claims to some extent, so there is a great dependence between them. Taking the Northeast
China Region as an example, during the winter, there are lots of similar accidents occurring because of
slippery roads. Meanwhile, the increase of the number of accidents will lead to the increase of the number
of insurance in the next phase, and it will directly inﬂuence the claim of the next phase. Based on this,
we introduce the claim intensity that has dependent structures, which is deﬁned as Λt in the risk model.
Since the number of claims increases constantly over time, we deﬁne that the number of claims as Nt,
obeying to the Poisson distribution with the intensity parameters, Λt + t. Because AR(1) series reﬂect
dependency and stability, and it considers the inﬂuence of random factors and the close relationship with
time. Therefore, we deﬁne that the intensity parameters, Λt, obeying to the AR(1), {Nt, t = 1, 2, · · ·} and

2

{Xi, i = 1, 2, · · ·} are independent. This makes the claim of insurance companies more reasonable and
eﬀective. What’s more, it promotes stable and healthy development of insurance industry in China. The
following is the basic deﬁnition and derivation of the model.

We will make the number of claims(N(t)) for the stochastic process which will be changed over time.
The number of claims of current phase will not only under the inﬂuence of various factors of current phase
but also be inﬂuenced by the previous phase. Based on this, there is a strong dependence. Furthermore,
the dependency of number of claims is reﬂected in the intensity of claim number. Therefore, we will
introduce the intensity of claim number which has a high dependence, deﬁned as Λt, to our model.

lnΛt = αln(Λt−1) + εt, t = 1, 2, · · ·,

among them εt is white noise series, and

εt ∼ N(µ, σ2),

which is the risk model we are about to establish. Let Nt be a Poisson counting process with parameter
Λt + t and it represents the number of claims in time period (0, t]. Parameter Λt obeys AR(1) model.
{Nt, t = 1, 2, · · ·} and {Xi, i = 1, 2, · · ·} are independent. Xi denotes the i-th claim size and it obeys an

The above is the risk model we established based on AR(1) series.

2 Properties of the Model and Parameter Estimation

2.1 Properties of the Model

In order to estimate the parameters of the model by using the method of moment estimation, we ﬁrst
study the properties of the model parameters. Then we ﬁgure out the expectation, the variance and
the third-order origin moment of the St which represents the total claims. First of all, we calculate the
expectation of St.

Since {Nt, t = 1, 2, · · ·} and the amount of the claims {Xi, i = 1, 2, · · ·} are independent, we have

E(St) = E[E(St | Nt)] = E(Nt) E(Xi) = E[E(Nt | Λt)] E(Xi).

For Nt obeys the poisson distribution with parameter Λt + t, we have E(Nt | Λt) = Λt + t. Thus,

E(St) = E[Λt + t] E(Xi).

Let lnΛt = Yt, we have Λt = eYt, where lnΛt = Yt obeys AR(1) which is a wide stationary sequence, namely

According to the property of the wide stationary time series, we have

Yt = α Yt−1 + εt, α ∈ (−1, 1), t = 1, 2, · · ·,

E(Yt) =

µ
1 − α

, Var(Yt) =

σ2
1 − α2

, ∀t = 1, 2, · · ·.

(3)

2.1 Properties of the Model

Therefore, E[Λt] = E[eYt] , where Yt ∼ N(
expectation E[Λt], we get

µ

1−α , σ2

1−α2 ), ∀t = 1, 2, ··· Furthermore, we calculate the mathematical

E[Λt] = E[eYt] = e

µ/(1−α)+σ2/2(1−α2).

Finally we obtain the expectation of St

E(St) = E[Λt + t] E(Xi) = [e

µ/(1−α)+σ2/2(1−α2) + t]E(Xi).

(4)

Secondly, we calculate the variance of St. Note that

Var(St) = E[Nt]Var(Xi) + E2(Xi)Var[Nt].
Derived from the foregoing E[Nt] = E[E(Nt | Λt)] = E[Λt + t] = eµ/(1−α)+σ2/2(1−α2) + t, further we calculate
the variance of Nt .

Var[Nt] = E[Var(Nt | Λt)] + Var[E(Nt | Λt)] = E[Λt + t] + Var[Λt] = t + E[Λt] + Var[Λt],

In this way, the calculation of the variance of the number of claims is transformed into the calculation of
the expectation and the variance of Λt. For

we can further calculate second-order origin moment of Λt.

Var[Λt] = E[Λ2

t ] − E2[Λt],

E[Λ2

t ] = E[(eYt)2] = E[e2Yt],

In addition, εt follows normal distribution (see (3)), and the normal distribution is additive. We can get
that 2Yt follows normal distribution,

Therefore,

so that the variance of St is

2Yt ∼ N(

2µ
1 − α

, 4σ2
1 − α2 ),

E[Λ2

t ] = E[e2Yt] = e2µ/(1−α)+2σ2/(1−α2).

Var(St) = [Var(Xi) + E2(Xi)] [e

2µ
1−α + 2σ2

1−α2 ].

(5)

Finally we calculate the third-order moment of St. First of all, we derive the moment generating

function of St. Note that

MSt(r) = E[eSt·r] = E[e

ΣNt
i=1Xi·r] = E[E(e
= E{[Mx(r)]Nt} = E[eNt·lnMx(r)] = MNt[lnMx(r)].

ΣNt
i=1Xi·r|Nt)] = E[ΠNt

i=1E(eXi·r)]

(6)

In this way, for the sake of the moment generating function of the St, we ﬁrst derive the moment generating
function of Nt,

MNt(r) = E[eNt·r] = E[E(eNt·r|Λt)] = E[e(Λt+t)(er−1)]

= et(er−1)E[e

Λt(er−1)] = et(er−1)MΛt(er − 1).

(7)

In order to further ﬁgure out the moment generating function of Nt, secondly, we derive the moment
generating function of Λt, that is

MΛt(r) = E[erΛt] = E[ereYt ],

(8)

where Yt ∼ N(

µ

1−α , σ2

1−α2 ). We substitute (8) into (7), it follows that

MNt(r) = et(er−1)E[e(er−1)eYt ].

(9)

By applying (9) to (6), we have

MSt(r) = et(Mx(r)−1)E[e(elnMx (r)−1)eYt ] = et(Mx(r)−1)E[e(Mx(r)−1)Λt].

where Mx(r) = 1

We ﬁgure out the parameters of the AR(1) series by the method of moment estimation. Through the
observed data of the total claims which are S1, S2, · · ·, Sn, the ﬁrst origin moment, the second origin
moment and the third order moments of the sample data are further obtained, which are recorded as

Therefore, we can get the estimation the parameters of α, µ and σ2 .

3 Adjustment Coeﬃcient and Ruin Probability of the Dependent

Model

In the classical model, the calculation of ruin probability is often diﬃcult, therefore we calculate the upper
bound of the ruin probability. This upper bound often depends on the adjustment coeﬃcient. First we
calculate the adjustment coeﬃcient of the surplus model. Since

U(t) = u + ct − St,
where U(t) represents surplus process, c represents premium income of the unit time, u is the initial
surplus. Because the {St, t = 1, 2 · ··} is an independent increment process, {U(t), t = 1, 2 · ··} is an
independent increment process. Let Ft = σ{Us; s ≤ t}, we have
] = e
−r·c·(t+1)e(t+1)[Mx(r)−1],

−r{u+c(t+1)−St+1}

−rU(t+1)|Ft] = E[e

−r·c·(t+1)E(erSt+1 )

−ruE[e

−rue

(13)

Based on the thought of the deﬁnition of R, in order to make the {e−rU(T), t > 0} a martingale, there must
be E[e−rU(t+1)|Ft] = e−rUt. That is E[e−rU(t+1)] = E[e−rUt]. By (13), we need to have e−rct · et[Mx(r)−1] = 1, ∀t > 0.
Therefore, we deﬁne the positive solution of

et[Mx(r)−1] = erct

(14)

is the adjustment coeﬃcient.

hence we get R,

It is easy to know that the adjustment coeﬃcient R is the solution of equation rc = Mx(r) − 1 = 1
R = c − θ

In the current insurance industry, c always needs to satisfy the condition which is

c > e

Thus c > θ.

According to the upper section of the adjustment factor, we consider the calculation of ruin probability.

We give the conclusion of ruin probability by Thm3.1.

Theorem 3.1 Consider the risk model( see (2)) with hypothesis Nt ∼ Pois(Λt + t), the exponential upper bound of
ruin probability is ψ(u) ≤ e−RuE[eΛt[Mx(R)−1]].

Proof: Note that

E[e

−rU(t)] = E[e

−rU(t)|T ≤ t]P{T ≤ t} + E[e

−rU(t)|T > t]P{T > t} > E[e

−rU(t)|T ≤ t]P{T ≤ t},

where T represents the time of ruin. Since

−rU(t) = −ru − rct + rSt,

we have

E[e

−rU(t)] = E[e

We know that R is the solution of et[Mx(r)−1] = erct. Then we put R into (16) leads to

E[e

−RU(t)] = E[e

−Ru−Rct+RSt] = e

−RuE[e

Λt(Mx(r)−1)].

First of all, notice that

E[e(St−ST)·r | T] = E[e

Xi·r | T] = E[ΠNt−T

i=1 eXi·r | T]

Then,

E[eNt−T·r|T] = E[e(Λt−ΛT+t−T)(er−1)|T].

(15)

(16)

6

In this way, we get

Note that,

Hence,

E[e(St−ST)·r | T] = E[e(Λt−ΛT+t−T)(Mx(r)−1) | T].

U(t) = U(T) + U(t) − U(T) = U(T) + c(t − T) − [St − ST],
−rU(t) = −rU(T) − rc(t − T) + r[St − ST].

E[e

−rU(t)|T ≤ t] = E[E[e
= E[E[e
= E[E[e
= E[e

−rU(t) | T] | T ≤ t]
−rU(T)−rc(t−T)+r[St−ST] | T] | T ≤ t]
−rU(T)e

−rc(t−T)e(t−T)[Mx(r)−1]e(Λt−ΛT)[Mx(r)−1] | T] | T ≤ t]

−rU(T)e
We put R which is the solution of the et[Mx(r)−1] = erct into the equation, it follows that,

−rc(t−T)e(t−T)[Mx(r)−1]e(Λt−ΛT)[Mx(r)−1] | T ≤ t].

E[e

−rU(t)|T ≤ t] = E[e

−RU(T)e(Λt−ΛT)[Mx(R)−1]|T ≤ t].

(17)

We multiply (17) by P{T ≤ t}. Letting t → +∞ yeilds P{T ≤ t} → ψ(u), therefore

E[e

−rU(t)|T ≤ t]P{T ≤ t} = E[e

−RU(T)e(Λt−ΛT)[Mx(R)−1]|T < ∞]ψ(u).

Thus (15) simpliﬁes to

e−RuE[eΛt[Mx(R)−1]]
E[e−RU(T)e(Λt−ΛT)[Mx(R)−1]|T < ∞]
for all u ≥ 0. As T ≤ t, NT ≤ Nt. Hence, E[NT] ≤ E[Nt], namely ΛT ≤ Λt.

ψ(u) ≤

,

For

Mx(R) − 1 =

1
1 − c−θ
c

− 1 = c
θ

− 1 > 0.

In this case, we have(Λt − ΛT)[Mx(R) − 1] ≥ 0.

Further, when R is the solution of equation(14) and T < ∞ , U(T) < 0. We have E[e−RU(T)e(Λt−ΛT)[Mx(R)−1]|T < ∞] ≥

1. Meanwhile, note that Λt follows model(1) and it is a stationary series, therefore E[eΛt[Mx(R)−1]] is a con-
stant and we can obtain it through (10). We get

ψ(u) ≤ e

−RuE[e

Λt[Mx(R)−1]]

(18)

which ﬁnally leads to the assertion. (cid:3)

4 Numerical Simulation

To check up the accuracy of our model using moment estimation method, we use AR(1) series for example
and select θ = 0.5, true-value α = 0.6 , µ = 0.8 and σ2 = 0.4 as parameters. Assuming that the initial
value lnΛ0 = µ
1−α = 2, in the environment of MATLAB , we try to do simulation towards α, σ and µ by
trying ﬁve turns, twenty turns and ﬁfty turns and ﬁgure out the average value. The results of simulation
are as follows in table 1. (where t-v represents truth value and para represents parameter) As we can see
from the table 1, the accuracy made by parameter estimation diﬀers from each other according to sample
capacity. It seems perfect towards the simulation of α and σ , the mean square error is less than 0.001, the
error upon parameter µ is less than 0.01 as well, which reﬂects the excellent simulating eﬀect. With the
increasement of samples, the deviation of estimation becomes smaller, which demonstrates the results are
consistent. Concluded, we ensure the veracity of parameter α, σ µ ﬁnally.
