Abstract

⊙

Nuclear weak rates in stellar environments are obtained by taking into account recent advances
in shell-model studies of spin-dependent excitation modes in nuclei including Gamow-Teller (GT)
and spin-dipole transitions. They are applied to nuclear weak processes in stars such as cooling and
heating of the cores of stars and nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The important roles of accurate
weak rates for the study of astrophysical processes are pointed out in the following cases. (1) The
electron-capture (e-capture) and β-decay rates in sd-shell are evaluated with the USDB Hamilto-
nian and used to study the evolution of O-Ne-Mg cores in stars with 8-10 M
. The important
roles of the A =23 and 25 pairs of nuclei for the cooling of the cores by nuclear Urca processes are
investigated. (2) They are also used to study heating of the O-Ne-Mg core by double e-captures on
20Ne in later stages of the evolution. Especially, the e-capture rates for a second-forbidden transi-
tion in 20Ne are evaluated with the multipole expansion method by Walecka as well as the method
of Behrens-B¨uhring. Possible important roles of the transition in heating the O-Ne-Mg cores and
implications on the ﬁnal fate of the cores (core-collapse or thermonuclear explosion) are discussed.
(3) The weak rates in pf -shell nuclei are evaluated with a new Hamiltonian, GXPF1J, and applied
to nucleosynthesis of iron-group elements in Type Ia supernova explosions. The over-production
problem of neutron-rich iron isotopes compared with the solar abundances, which remained for
the rates according to Fuller, Fowler and Newman, is much improved, and the over-production is
now reduced to be within a factor of two. (4) The weak rates for nuclei with two-major shells
are evaluated. For sd-pf shell in the island of inversion, the weak rates for the A=31 pair of
nuclei, which are important for nuclear Urca processes in neutron-star crusts, are evaluated with
the eﬀective interaction obtained by the extended Kuo-Krenciglowa (EKK) method. Neutron-rich
nuclei with and near neutron number (N ) of 50 are important for core-collapse processes in su-
pernova explosions. The transition strengths and e-capture rates in 78Ni are evaluated with a new
shell-model Hamiltonian for the pf -sdg shell, and compared with those obtained by the random-
phase-approximation (RPA) and an eﬀective rate formula. (5) β-decay rates and half-lives of N
=126 isotones, the waiting point nuclei for r-process nucleosynthesis, are evaluated by shell-model
calculations with both the GT and ﬁrst-forbidden transitions. The important roles of the forbid-
den transitions are pointed out for the isotones with larger proton number (Z). The half-lives
are found to be shorter than those obtained by standard models such as the ﬁnite-range droplet
model (FRDM) by M¨oller. (6) Neutrino-nucleus reaction cross sections on 13C, 16O and 40Ar are
obtained with new shell-model Hamiltonians. Implications on nucleosynthesis, neutrino detection,
neutrino oscillations and neutrino mass hierarchy are discussed.

Introduction

Due to the recent progress in the studies of both experimental and theoretical aspects of nuclear physics,
more accurate evaluations of nuclear weak rates have become feasible, and transition rates important
for astrophysical processes have been updated and accumulated. A number of new exotic nuclei have
been produced at radio-active beam (RIB) factories in the world, and the number of nuclides amounted
up to more than three thousands until now. The shell structure is found to change toward driplines,
with disappearance of traditional magic numbers and appearance of new magic numbers. These shell
evolutions have been studied based on monopole components of nucleon-nucleon interactions [1, 2]. The
important roles of various parts of nuclear forces, such as central, tensor, spin-orbit and three-nucleon
interactions, for the shell evolution have been also clariﬁed.

Electron-capture (e-capture) and β-decay rates in stellar environments as well as neutrino-induced
reaction cross sections have been updated with the use of new shell-model Hamiltonians constructed
on the basis of the developments mentioned above. Spin-dependent transitions play dominant roles in
the weak rates and cross sections. The leading contributions come from the Gamow-Teller (GT) and
spin-dipole (SD) transitions. In the present review, we discuss recent progress in the reﬁnement of the
weak rates and cross sections, and its important implications for astrophysical processes.

We discuss the precise evaluations of e-capture and β-decay rates and their applications to the stellar
evolution and nucleosynthesis in stars. Up to now, many studies have been done to obtain the weak
rates in various regions of nuclides since the pioneering work by Fuller, Fowler and Newman [3], where
allowed Fermi and GT transitions were taken into account. The weak rates were then reﬁned and
tabulated by using shell-model calculations combined with available experimental data for sd-shell [4]
and pf -shell nuclei [5]. For heavier nuclei in the pf g/sdg-shell (A = 65 -112), the rates were obtained
by the shell model Monte Carlo (SMMC) approach combined with random phase approximation (RPA)
including both allowed and forbidden transitions [6].

Here, we further reﬁne the weak rates for sd-shell and pf -shell nuclei induced by GT transitions
by using new shell-model Hamiltonians. The obtained rates for sd-shell nuclei are used to study the
evolution of O-Ne-Mg cores in stars with 8-10 M
. Cooling of the core by nuclear Urca processes and
heating of the core by double e-capture processes in the evolution are investigated. In particular, we
discuss the weak rates induced by a second-forbidden transition in 20Ne, which can be important for
heating the core in the late stage of the evolution and its ﬁnal fate, either core-collapse or thermonuclear
explosion.

⊙

The rates for pf -shell nuclei are reﬁned and applied to nucleosynthesis of iron-group elements in
Type Ia supernova (SN) explosions. The over-production of neutron-rich isotopes compared with the
solar abundances is shown to be suppressed when using the improved rates.

We then extend our study to nuclides where two-major shells are concerned. The weak rates for
sd-pf -shell nuclei in the island of inversion relevant to nuclear Urca processes in neutron star crusts will
be evaluated with a new eﬀective interaction derived from an extended G-matrix method applicable
to two-major shells. The weak rates in neutron-rich pf -g-shell nuclei with neutron magicity at N=50,
which are important for gravitational core-collapse processes, will also be evaluated by shell-model
calculations at Z=28 with full pf -sdg shell model space. Spin-dipole transition strengths and e-capture
rates in 78Ni are investigated. Improvements in the method of calculation and extension of the model
space are shown to be important for accurate evaluations of the rates.

The β-decay rates and half-lives of waiting-point nuclei at N=126, important for r-process nucle-
osynthesis, are studied by including both GT and ﬁrst-forbidden (spin-dipole) transitions. Half-lives
consistent with recent experimental data but short compared to those obtained by the standard FRDM
method are obtained.

As the treatment of forbidden transitions is rather complex and not easy to access for primers,
formulae for the ﬁrst and second-forbidden transitions by the multipole expansion method of Walecka

2

as well as of Behrens-B¨uhring are explained.

Finally, we discuss neutrino-induced reactions on carbon isotopes, as well as on 16O and 40Ar,
at reactor, solar and supernova neutrino energies. The cross sections reﬁned by recent shell-model
calculations are important for neutrino detection by recent carbon-based scintillators, water Cerenkov
detectors and liquid argon time projection chambers, as well as for nucleosynthesis in SN and study of
neutrino properties such as their mass hierarchy.

Astrophysical topics treated here are not inclusive, and more or less related to the weak rates
discussed in this work. More emphasis is put on the role of nuclear physics in obtaining the weak rates.
In Sect. 2, we discuss e-capture and β-decay rates for sd-shell nuclei and evolution of high-density
O-Ne-Mg cores. The weak rates for pf -shell nuclei and nucleosynthesis of iron-group elements in Type
Ia SN explosions are discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, the weak rates for cross-shell nuclei in sd-pf and
pf -g shells are studied. β-decay rates for isotones with N = 126 are investigated in Sect. 5. In Sect.
6, we discuss neutrino-nucleus reactions relevant to neutrino detection, nucleosynthesis and study of
neutrino mass hierarchy. Summary is given in Sect. 7.

2 Weak Rates for sd-Shell Nuclei and Evolution of High-

Density O-Ne-Mg Cores

2.1 Evolution of 8-10 Solar Mass Stars

The evolution and ﬁnal fate of stars depend on their initial masses MI. Stars with MI = 0.5-8 M
form
electron degenerate C-O cores after helium burning and end as C-O white dwarfs. Stars more massive
form O-Ne-Mg cores after carbon burning. The O-Ne-Mg core is mostly composed of 16O
than 8 M
and 20Ne, with minor amounts of 23Na, 24Mg, 25Mg and 27Al. Stars with MI > 10 M
form Fe cores
⊙
and later explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSN). Stars with MI = 8-10 M
can end up in various
ways such as (1) O-Ne-Mg white dwarfs, (2) e-capture SN explosion with neutron star (NS) remnants
[7, 8, 9, 10], or (3) thermonuclear explosion with O-Ne-Fe white dwarf remnants [11].

In cases (2) and (3), as the O-Ne-Mg cores evolve, the density and temperature in the central region
increase and the chemical potential (Fermi energy) of electrons reaches the threshold energy of e-capture
on various nuclei in stars. The e-capture process, on one hand, leads to the contraction of the core
due to the loss of the pressure of degenerate electrons. The energy production associated with the
e-capture, on the other hand, increases the temperature and induces explosive oxygen burning. During
the evolution, the densities and temperatures of the core are of the order 108
9 K,
−
respectively.

As the density increases, the e-capture process is favored because of larger chemical potential of
electrons, while the β-decay process is hindered because of smaller phase space of the decaying electrons.
For a particular nuclear pair, X and Y, a condition becomes fulﬁlled at a certain density such that both

occur simultaneously. In such a case, both the emitted neutrinos and anti-neutrinos take away energy
from the star, which leads to an eﬃcient cooling of the core. This cooling mechanism is called the nuclear
8-10 M
Urca process. The fate of the stars with MI ∼
is determined by the competing processes of
contraction and cooling or heating induced by e-capture and β-decay processes. Theoretical predictions
of the fate also depend on the treatment of convection and Coulomb eﬀects [12, 13, 10, 14].

⊙

As the O-Ne-Mg core evolves and the density of the core increases, e-captures on nuclei are triggered
in order of their Q-values. For the even mass number components of the core, as energies of even-even

Figure 1: β-decay Q-values for sd-shell nuclei. (a) Odd and (b) even mass number cases are
shown separately.

nuclei are lowered by pairing eﬀects, e-captures on even-even nuclei have larger magnitude of Q-values
than odd mass number cases in general. The e-captures on odd mass number nuclei, therefore, take
place ﬁrst and the cooling of the core by nuclear Urca processes occurs. The e-captures on even mass
number components of the core are triggered later at higher densities. Successive e-captures on the
odd-odd daughter nuclei occur immediately after the ﬁrst e-captures because of small magnitude of
Q-values due to the pairing eﬀects, thus leading to double e-capture processes on even mass number
components. The core is heated by γ emission from excited states of daughter nuclei in these processes.
The Q-value of the weak process determines the density at which the process is triggered. β-decay
Q-values for (a) odd mass number (A = 17-31) and (b) even mass number (A =18-30) sd-shell nuclei are
shown in Fig. 1. Solid and dashed lines in Fig. 1(b) denote odd-odd and even-even nuclei, respectively.
We see that the Q-values are small especially for odd mass number nuclear pairs with A = 23, 25
and 27, that is, for (X, Y) = (23Na, 23Ne), (25Mg, 25Na) and (27Al, 27Mg). The Q-values are 4.376 MeV,
3.835 MeV and 2.610 MeV, respectively, for the A = 23, 25 and 27 pairs. Among even mass number
nuclei, e-captures on 20Ne and 24Mg, which are components of the O-Ne-Mg core, are important. The
Q-values of the pairs of A =24 and 20, for (X, Y) = (24Mg, 24Na) and (20Ne, 20F), are 5.516 MeV and
7.024 MeV, respectively. Q-values of the successive e-captures on 24Na and 20F are -2.470 MeV and
-3.814 MeV, respectively.

Here, we deﬁne ’Urca density’ as that density where both the e-capture and β-decay processes take
place simultaneously almost independent of the temperature. The cooling timescale, which depends on
the e-capture and β-decay rates, needs to be shorter than the crossing timescale, which is related to the
time the core evolves in the density range where the Urca process is active [15]. The Urca density is
estimated to be log10(ρYe)
8.8 -9.0 for the A=23 and 25 pairs. In case of the A=27 pair, the transitions
between the ground states are forbidden ones, and the Urca cooling eﬀect is negligible [15]. Nuclear
Urca processes occur for the 25Mg-25Na pair and then for the 23Na-23Ne pair. The cooling of the core
by the Urca process for the pairs with A=23 and 25 will be discussed in Sect. 2.3.

Electron-captures on 24Mg and 20Ne are triggered at higher densities given by log10(ρYe)

9.3 and
9.5, respectively. In the later stage of the evolution of the O-Ne-Mg core, double e-capture reactions
on 24Mg and 20Ne, namely 24Mg (e−, νe) 24Na (e−, νe) 24Ne and 20Ne (e−, νe) 20F (e−, νe) 20O, become
important for the heating of the core.

≈

The e-capture reaction, 20Ne (0+, g.s.) (e−, νe) 20F (2+, g.s.) is a second-forbidden transition. The
transition was pointed out to be rather important at densities of log10 (ρYe) = 9.2-9.6 and temperatures
of log10 (T )
8.8 [16]. Recently, it was argued that the heating of the O-Ne-Mg core might lead to
thermonuclear expansion of the star instead of e-capture SN explosion, because of the contributions
from the second-forbidden transition [11]. We will discuss this issue in Sect. 2.5.

2.2 Electron-Capture and β-Decay Rates in sd-Shell

In this subsection, electron-capture and β-decay rates for sd-shell nuclei in stellar environments are
updated by shell-model calculations with the use of USDB Hamiltonian [17]. The weak rates for sd-
shell nuclei (A = 17 -39) obtained with the USD Hamiltonian [18, 19] were tabulated in Ref. [4]. The
USDB is an updated version of the USD improved by taking into account recent data of neutron-rich

5

nuclei. While neutron-rich oxygen and ﬂuorine isotopes were overbound for the USD, the new version
is free from this problem.

The e-capture rates at high densities and temperatures are evaluated as [3, 5, 20]

Transitions from the excited states of the parent nucleus are taken into account by the partition
function Wi, as they can become important for high temperatures and low excitation energies. Because
of the factors Se(ω) and 1
ij, respectively, the e-capture (β-decay)
rates increase (decrease) as the density and the electron chemical potential increase. The neutrino-
energy-loss rates and γ-ray heating rates are also evaluated. The rates are evaluated for log10(ρYe) =
8.0 -11.0 in ﬁne steps of 0.02 and log10T = 8.0 -9.65 (7.0 -8.0) in steps of 0.05 (0.20).

The e-capture and β-decay rates for the (23Na, 23Ne) and (25Mg, 25Na) pairs are shown in Figs. 2
and 3, respectively. Here the Coulomb corrections are taken into account [21, 22, 23]. The Coulomb
corrections aﬀect the thermodynamic properties of a high density plasma. The interaction of ions in a
uniform electron background leads to corrections to the equation of state of matter, and modiﬁes the
chemical potential of the ions. The corrections to the chemical potential have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the
abundance distributions of nuclei in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE), as well as on the conductive
thermonuclear ﬂames and the neutralization rate of matter in NSE in massive white dwarfs near the
Chandrasekhar point [24].

The Coulomb eﬀects on the weak rates are mainly caused by the modiﬁcation of the threshold

energy,

−
where µC (Z) is the Coulomb chemical potential of the nucleus with charge number Z [25, 26, 27]. The
threshold energy is enhanced for e-capture processes, and the e-capture (β-decay) rates are reduced
(enhanced) by the Coulomb eﬀects.

peratures log10T = 8.0-9.2 in steps of 0.2. Electron-capture rates (solid curves) increase with
density, while β-decay rates (dashed curves) decrease with density. (b) Comparison of the
cases with and without the Coulomb eﬀects at log10T =8.7.

Another correction to the rates comes from the reduction of the electron chemical potential. The
amount of the reduction is evaluated by using the dielectric function obtained by relativistic random
phase approximation (RPA) [28]. This correction also leads to a slight reduction (enhancement) of
e-capture (β-decay) rates.

Eﬀects of the Coulomb eﬀects on the rates are shown in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b) for the A=23 and A=25
pairs, respectively, at log10T = 8.7 in comparison with the case without the Coulomb eﬀects. Here,
the quenching of the axial-vector coupling constant is taken to be gef f
A /gA = 0.764 [29]. Transitions
from the states with excitation energies up to Ex = 2 MeV are taken into account. For the A=23
g.s., 5/2+, 7/2+ and 1/2+ states of 23Na are included for the
pair (23Na, 23Ne), transitions from 3/2+
e-capture reactions, while the 5/2+
g.s. and 1/2+ states of 23Ne are taken into account for the β-decays.
The Urca density is found at log10(ρYe) = 8.96 and 8.92 for the case with and without the Coulomb
eﬀects, respectively. The dependence on the temperature is quite small. The Urca density is shifted
upwards by ∆log10(ρYe) = 0.04 by the Coulomb eﬀects.

For the (25Mg, 25Na) pair, the Urca density is also found at log10(ρYe) = 8.81 (8.77) for the case
2 states in 25Mg

g.s., 1/2+, 3/2+, 7/2+ and 5/2+

with (without) the Coulomb eﬀects. Transitions from 5/2+
and 5/2+

g.s., 3/2+ and 1/2+ states of 25Na are included.

In case of the A=27 pair (27Al, 27Mg), the GT transition does not occur between the ground states,
as the ground states of 27Al and 27Mg are 5/2+ and 1/2+, respectively. An evaluation of the weak rates
including the second-forbidden transition has been done in Ref. [15].

Now, we comment on the diﬀerence of the GT strengths between the USDB and USD cases. The
GT strengths in 23Na and 25Mg are more spread for USDB compared to USD, and larger strengths
remain more in the higher excitation energy region for the USDB case[23]. However, when available
experimental data of B(GT) and energies are taken into account as in Ref. [4], the diﬀerences in the
calculated rates become quite small.

Besides the (23Na, 23Ne) and (25Mg, 25Na) pairs, Urca processes can occur for (24Mg, 24Na), (21Ne,
9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.8 and 9.9,

21F), (25Na, 25Ne), (23Ne, 23F), and (27Mg, 27Na) pairs at log10(ρYe)
respectively, for the case without the Coulomb eﬀects.

nuclei with A =17-28, evaluated with the Coulomb eﬀects by the USDB Hamiltonian, have been tabu-
lated in Ref. [23] for densities log10(ρYe) = 8.0-11.0 in steps of 0.02 and temperatures log10T = 8.0 -9.65
(7.0-8.0) in steps of 0.05 (0.20). Experimental B(GT) and excitation energies available [19, 30, 31, 32]
are taken into account here. Note that the rates in the table of Ref. [4] were evaluated without the
Coulomb eﬀects, and were given only at log10(ρYe) = 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. On the other hand, as the
rates in Ref. [4] have been obtained with larger number of excited nuclear states than in the present
calculation, they may be more suitable for use at higher densities and temperatures where Si burning
occurs.

Here, we comment on our choice of ﬁne meshes with steps of 0.02 in log10(ρYe) and 0.05 in log10T .
It is not possible to get an accurate rate by interpolation procedures with a sparse grid of densities.
It is true that a procedure using eﬀective log f t values proposed by Ref. [33] works well for certain
cases where the change of the rates by orders of magnitude comes mainly from the phase space factor
while the remaining parts, including the nuclear transition strength, do not change drastically. When
the transitions between the ground states are forbidden or transitions from excited states give essential
contributions, this method becomes invalid, for example for the pairs (27Al, 27Mg) and (20Ne, 20F). As
will be shown in the next subsection, the use of ﬁne grids works well for the calculation of the cooling
of the O-Ne-Mg core. Instead of using tabulated rates with ﬁne grids of density and temperature, an
alternative way is to use analytic expressions for the rates as in Ref. [16]. Such a ’on the ﬂy’ approach
was recently implemented in the stellar evaluation code MESA [34] including an extension to forbidden
transitions [15].

2.3 Cooling of the O-Ne-Mg Core by Nuclear Urca Processes

Now we show how the cooling of the O-Ne-Mg core is realized by the Urca processes in the nuclear pairs
with A=23 (23Na, 23Ne) and A=25 (25Mg, 25Na). The time evolution of the central temperature in the
8.8M

star is shown in Fig. 4.

The star forms an electron-degenerate O-Ne-Mg core after C burning in the central region and,
during t = 0 to 4 yr, its central density increases from log10 ρc = 9.0 to 9.4. Two distinct drops of the
temperature due to A=25 Urca cooling up to around log10ρc = 9.1, and due to A=23 Urca cooling,
between log10ρc =9.15 and 9.25, can be seen. When the temperature drops take place, the abundances
of 25Mg and 23Na also drop due to the e-captures, eventually dominating over β-decays.
After the Urca cooling, double e-captures on 24Mg and 20Ne occur inside the 8.8M

leads to heating of the core and ignition of oxygen deﬂagration, resulting in an e-capture SN (ECSN).
If the contraction of the core is fast enough, it will collapse, otherwise thermonuclear explosion may
occur. The ﬁnal fate, collapse or explosion, is determined by the competition between the contraction
of the core due to e-captures on post-deﬂagration material and the energy release by the propagation
of the deﬂagration ﬂames. This subject is discussed in Sect.2.5.

to be suppressed just at the density, where the energy production becomes positive. In the case of the
β-decay transition, < Eprod > is suppressed by neutrino emissions below the Urca density. When it
becomes negative at the Urca density, the energy loss begins to increase monotonically with increasing

2.4 Weak Rates for the Forbidden Transitions 20Ne (0+

↔

The weak rates for A=20 pairs, (20Ne, 20F) and (20F, 20O), were evaluated in Refs. [23, 36, 16]. In the
case of the (20Ne, 20F) pair, the transitions between the ground states are forbidden and the main GT
contributions come from transitions between 20Ne (0+
g.s.) and 20F (1+, 1.057 MeV) and those between
20Ne (2+, 1.634 MeV) and 20F (2+
g.s.). The rates were obtained in Ref. [36] by assuming only GT
transitions. The eﬀects from the second forbidden transition between the ground states were also
estimated in Refs. [16, 23] by assuming that the transition is an allowed GT one, with the strength
determined to reproduce log ft = 10.5, which was the experimental lower limit for the β-decay, 20F
(2+
g.s.) [30]. However, the strengths for forbidden transitions generally depend on the
lepton energies, contrary to the case of allowed transitions. Recently, a new log ft value for the β-decay
was measured: log = 10.89

Here, we evaluate the weak rates for forbidden transitions in proper ways by using the multipole
expansion method of Walecka [38] as well as the method of Behrens-B¨uhring [39]. Electrons are treated
as plane waves in the method of Walecka, while in the method of Behrens-B¨uhring electrons are treated
as distorted waves in a Coulomb potential, and coupling terms between the transition operators and the
Coulomb wave functions are taken into account. The latter method is more accurate, but its formulae
are rather complex for primers. We start from the method of Walecka, which is easier to handle, and
compare it with that of Behrens-B¨uhring, clarifying their diﬀerences.

In the case of ﬁrst-forbidden transitions, the axial Coulomb and longitudinal multipoles contribute
for 0− and 2−, and axial electric and vector magnetic quadrupoles additionally contribute for 2−. For
1−, there are contributions from the Coulomb, longitudinal and electric dipoles from the weak vector
current, and the axial magnetic dipole from the weak axial-vector current.

For second-forbidden transitions, 0+

2+, the transition matrix elements of the Coulomb, longi-
tudinal and electric transverse operators from the weak vector current, as well as the axial magnetic
operator from the weak axial-vector current with multipolarity J = 2 contribute to the rates.

In the multipole expansion method of Ref. [38], leptons are treated as plane waves and eﬀects of
Coulomb interaction between the electron and the nucleus are taken into account by the Fermi function.
However, in forbidden transitions, the Coulomb distortion of electron wave functions needs a more
careful treatment. This has been done with explicit inclusion of Coulomb wave functions [39, 50, 51].

especially in the low electron energy region. The diﬀerence between the Behrens-B¨uhring (BB) and
the Walecka methods is insigniﬁcant. The e-capture rates obtained with the CVC are also found to
be enhanced compared to those without the CVC relation by an order of magnitude at log10(ρYe)
≥
9.6. The diﬀerence between the BB and the Walecka methods with the CVC relation is rather small.
The rates obtained with the GT prescription with log f t =10.5, which was adopted in Ref. [16], are
close to the rates obtained with the CVC at log10ρYe < 9.6, while they become smaller beyond log10ρYe
=9.6. Note that the optimum log ft value for a constant shape factor determined from likelihood ﬁt to
the experimental β-decay spectrum is equal to 10.46 (see Table III of Ref. [52]). The e-capture rates
have been also evaluated in Refs. [37, 52] by the method of Behrens-B¨uhring (BB) with the use of the
CVC relation for the transverse E2 matrix element. The calculated rates at log10T =8.6 are shown in
20Ne (2+,
Fig. 6(b). In Ref. [52], the experimental strength of B(E2) for the transition 20Ne (0+
10.273 MeV) has been used for the evaluation of the matrix element x in Eq. (16). This results in
a reduction of x by about 27% compared with the calculated value. Except for this point, the rates
obtained in Refs. [37, 52] are essentially the same as those denoted by USDB (BB, CVC) in Fig. 6. They
are close to each other as we see from Fig. 6(b). The rates in Ref. [53] correspond to those denoted by
USDB obtained without the CVC relation.

2.5 Heating of the O-Ne-Mg Core by Double Electron-Capture Processes

and Evolution toward Electron-capture Supernovae

In this subsection, we discuss the eﬀects of the forbidden transition in the e-capture processes on 20Ne
on the evolution of the ﬁnal stages of the high-density electron-degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores. When the
core is compressed and the core mass becomes close to the Chandrasekhar mass, the core undergoes
exothermic electron captures on 24Mg and 20Ne, that release enough energy to cause thermonuclear
ignition of oxygen fusion and an oxygen-burning deﬂagration. The ﬁnal fate of the core, whether
collapse or explosion, is determined by the competition between the energy release by the propagating
oxygen deﬂagration wave and the reduction of the degeneracy pressure due to electron captures on
the post-deﬂagration material in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). As the energy release by double
electron captures in A=20 and 24 nuclei is about 3 MeV and 0.5 MeV per a capture, respectively, heating
of the core due to γ emissions succeeding the reactions, 20Ne (e−, νe) 20F (e−, νe) 20O, is important in
the ﬁnal stage of the evolution of the core.

Here we discuss the heating of O-Ne-Mg core by double e-capture reactions on 20Ne in late stages
of star evolution. The averaged energy production and averaged energy loss by neutrino emissions
for e-capture reactions on 20Ne and subsequent e-capture processes on 20F are shown in Fig. 9 for
temperatures log10T =8.6 and 9.0. The energy production for e-capture on 20Ne is negative up to
log10ρYe =9.5 (9.6) at log10T = 8.6 (9.0), while it is positive on 20F beyond log10ρYe ≈
9.1 (9.2) at
log10T =8.6 (9.0). For log10T =8.6, the contributions from the second-forbidden transition become
important at log10ρYe =9.3-9.6 and enhance the energy production (see Fig. 6 of Ref. [16] also for the
case without the forbidden transition). Their eﬀects on the averaged energy production and energy loss
by ν emissions are quite similar in amount among the cases USDB with CVC, USDB without CVC,
and BB with CVC, as shown in Fig. 9 (a). The net energy production for the double e-captures on
20Ne and 20F becomes positive at log10ρYe =9.3 (9.4) at log10T =8.6 (9.0).

The oxygen ignition occurs in the central region of the core, within

100 km from the center, initiated
by heating due to e-capture on 20Ne. Here, ignition is deﬁned as the stage where the nuclear energy
generation exceeds the thermal neutrino losses. The central density at the oxygen ignition is denoted as

when the time scale of temperature rise gets shorter than the dynamical time scale. The central density
when the oxygen deﬂagration starts is denoted as ρc,def . Note that at the oxygen ignition, the heating
8 s, which is 8-9 orders of magnitude larger
timescale by local oxygen burning is estimated to be
than the dynamical timescale [54], and the thermonuclear runaway of the local oxygen burning does
not take place yet. Thus ρc,def is not the same as ρc,ign, usually it is higher than ρc,ign.

∼

Further evolution of the core depends on the competition between the nuclear energy release by
the oxygen deﬂagration and the reduction of the degeneracy pressure by e-capture in the NSE ash [55,
56, 11, 57]. Recent multidimensional simulations of the oxygen deﬂagration show that the competition
depends sensitively on the value of ρc,def . If ρc,def is higher than a certain critical density ρcr, the core
collapses to form a neutron star (NS) due to e-capture [58, 59, 60], while if ρc,def < ρcr thermonuclear
energy release dominates to induce partial explosion of the core [11].

For ρcr, the values log10(ρcr/g cm−

the second-forbidden transition for the e-capture on 20Ne (denoted as USDB in Figs. 6 and 7) have
been used. The core evolves through complicated processes of mass accretion, heating by e-capture,
cooling by Urca processes, and Ye change.
It has been investigated how the location of the oxygen
ignition (center or oﬀ-center) and the Ye distribution depend on the input physics and the treatment
of the semiconvection and convection. There are two extreme criteria for the convective stability, the
Schwarzschild criterion and the Ledoux criterion [68, 69]. The Schwarzschild criterion is given as

When the Schwarzschild criterion for the convective stability is applied, the oxygen ignition takes

in future by improving the stellar evolution modeling.

In case of thermonuclear explosions, the oxygen deﬂagration results in a partial disruption of the O-
Ne-Mg core with an O-Ne-Fe WD left behind [11]. The turbulent mixing by the ﬂame allows the ejecta
to consist of both Fe-peak elements and O-Ne-rich fuel. Ejecta can be rich in neutron-rich isotopes
such as 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, 60Fe and 66Zn, which are overproduced relative to their solar abundances [70].
A substantial enrichment was reported for 54Cr and 50Ti with 54Cr/52Cr and 50Ti/48Ti ratios ranging
from 1.2 to 56 and from 1.1 to 455 times the solar values, respectively, in the presolar oxide grains from
the Orguil CI meteorite [71]. The enrichment of 54Cr and 50Ti obtained in ejecta in the thermonuclear
explosion simulation [11] is found to be consistent with the most extreme grain, 237, among the enriched
grains.

Using the solar abundance distribution as constraint, an upper limit of the frequency of thermonu-
clear e-capture SN explosion (ECSNe) has been estimated to be
1-3 % of the frequency of core-collapse
SN explosion for the metalicity range Z =0.004-0.00 [70]. This probability is similar to or one order
of magnitude smaller than the following estimates for ECSNe. The ECSNe rate was predicted to be
2-5% [73] for Z =0.02-0.0001 from stellar evolution simulations. The
3-21% [72] (see [73] also) and
diﬀerence at lower Z comes from the metalicity scaling of the mass-loss rate taken in [72]. A narrow
initial mass range for ECSNe, at most 0.2 M
, obtained in [73] leads to a lower ECSNe rate,

for the rate [74]. The ECSNe rate was estimated to be

nucleosynthesis analysis of elements from Zn to Zr, 48Ca and 60Fe [75, 76]. It is not easy to ﬁnd clear
evidence for thermonuclear ECSN (tECSN) or collapsing ECSN (cECSN). In tECSN, O-Ne-Fe WD is
expected to be formed as a remnant.
Information on its mass-radius relation could assign O-Ne-Fe

3 Electron-Capture Rates for pf -Shell Nuclei and Nucleosyn-

thesis of Iron-Group Elements

3.1 Type Ia Supernova Explosion

In this section, we discuss important roles played by e-capture rates in pf -shell nuclei for the nucleosyn-
thesis of iron-group elements in Type Ia supernova explosions (SNe). Type Ia supernovae are thought
to result from accreting C-O white dwarfs (WDs) in close binaries.

When the WD reaches a certain critical condition, thermonuclear burning initiated in the electron-
degenerate core results in a violent explosion of the whole star. The subsequent nucleosynthesis results
in an abundance of Fe-peak elements and intermediate-mass elements such as Ca, S, Si, Mg and O.
The ejection of these elements into the interstellar medium (ISM) contributes to the galactic chemical
enrichment. Electron-captures reduce the electron mole fraction Ye, and enhance the abundance of
neutron-rich Fe-peak elements. The detailed abundance ratios with respect to 56Fe (or 56Ni) depend
on the central densities of the WDs and the nature of ﬂame propagation triggered by thermonuclear
burning.

There are two types of models for Type Ia SNe. The ﬁrst is the typical case of accretion from a non-
degenerate companion star, where the WD mass approaches the Chandrasekhar mass, inducing a SN
Ia. This is known as the single-degenerate progenitor model. The other case is the double-degenerate
model, where two WDs merge to produce a SN Ia. The central densities (ρc) of the exploding WDs
3
108 g cm−
are diﬀerent in the two cases: ρc > 109 g cm−
in the double-degenerate model. In case of the single-degenerate model with high central densities, a
signiﬁcant amount of Fe-group elements are synthesized as a result of e-capture reactions. On the other
hand, in case of the double-degenerate model with lower central densities, less amount of stable Ni
isotopes is produced due to little e-capture processes. It is thus important to accurately evaluate the
e-capture rates relevant for nucleosynthesis in Type Ia SNe to constrain the explosion conditions and
the explosion models.

3.2 Electron-Capture Rates in pf -Shell

In Ref.
[3] (hereafter referred as FFN), e-capture rates were obtained based on simple shell-model
calculations as well as using available experimental GT strengths. It was noticed that an overproduction
problem of iron-group elements relative to the solar abundances in Type Ia SNe occurs when the FFN
rates are used [79]. Evaluations of the rates have been improved by large-scale shell-model calculations
(LSSM). It was found that the FFN e-capture rates overestimate the rates of the LSSM calculations in
many cases [80]. The e-capture rates in pf -shell nuclei are obtained by LSSM calculations with the use
of KB3 Hamiltonians [2], and they are tabulated for a wide range of nuclei [5] for the KBF Hamiltonian
[81]. The KBF rates are generally used as standards for nucleosynthesis calculations.

Here, we use a new shell-model Hamiltonian for pf -shell, GXPF1J [82], for the evaluation of the weak
rates. The GXPF1J is a modiﬁed version of the original GXPF1 Hamiltonian [83]. New experimental
data of neutron-rich Ca, Ti, and Cr isotopes are taken into account, and the peak position of the
magnetic dipole (M1) strength in 48Ca is reproduced. The experimental B(M1) strength in 48Ca is
reproduced by reducing the calculated one with the quenching of the spin g factor, gef f
0.02.
The KBF and KB3G [84], the most recent version of KB3’s, give energies for the 1+ state in 48Ca
about 1 MeV below the experimental one. The M1 strength is split into two states for KB3G. The M1

with the GXPF1J are found to be more fragmented with remaining tails at high excitation energies,
compared to those of the KB3G [86, 87]. This is true also for the GT+ strengths in 58Ni, 60Ni and 62Ni
[20].

Now we discuss the GT strength in 56Ni, as experimental data from (p, n) reactions are available and
56Ni is produced in large amounts in the inner part of the WDs. The e-capture rates on 56Ni aﬀects the
production yield of 58Ni, which was known to be over-produced by several times the solar abundance,
if the FFN rates are used. Suppression of the rates, which leads to less neutron-rich environment with
higher Ye, can ﬁx this over-production problem. Optical light curves in Type Ia SNe are dominated
by photons produced in the radiative decay of 56Ni through 56Co to 56Fe. The maximal luminosity is
determined by the amount of 56Ni. Photon emissions from 56Co and 56Fe are important for the light
curve at later times. More accurate evaluation of the e-capture rates on 56Ni is thus important to ﬁx
these issues. Moreover, one of the most noticeable diﬀerences in the strength distribution among shell-
model Hamiltonians is seen in the case of 56Ni. Values for B(GT) obtained by shell-model calculations
with GXPF1J, KBF and KB3G, as well as the experimental data, are shown in Fig. 12 (a).

The GT strength has two peaks for the GXPF1J, consistent with the experimental data. However,
this structure is not seen for the KBF and KB3G. The strength from the 2+ state at 2.70 MeV is also
shown for the GXPF1J case. The integrated GT strengths up to a certain excitation energy (Ex) of
56Cu are compared in Fig. 12(b). Their diﬀerence becomes noticeable at Ex > 3 MeV, while it is small
in the region corresponding to electron chemical potential less than 1.5 MeV.

The e-capture rates for 56Ni evaluated with the GXPF1J, KBF and KB3G are shown as a function
of temperature and density (ρYe) in Fig. 13(a). The ratios of the rates for GXPF1J and KB3G relative
to those of KBF are also shown in Fig. 13(b) at T9= 0.1 and 5. The KB3G gives the highest rates

overall at high temperatures and densities, as expected from the diﬀerence in the fragmentation of the
GT strengths. The diﬀerence between the KBF and the GXPF1J is as small as 10-20% in most cases
and decreases at high temperatures.

Here, we comment on possible eﬀects of the contributions from excited states of parent nuclei.
Excited states with Ex < 2 MeV are taken into account in the present calculations. In case of 56Ni, the
2+ state is located at Ex = 2.70 MeV, and its contribution to the e-capture rates is insigniﬁcant. For
58Ni and 60Ni, 2+ states are at Ex = 1.45 and 1.33 MeV, respectively, and contribute to the rates to
108
some extent at low densities [20]. In particular for 60Ni, the eﬀects become non-negligible at ρYe ≤
g cm−

3 because of a large negative Q value for the e-capture process, Q = -3.34 MeV.

As for other pf -shell nuclei, the ratios of the e-capture rates of GXPF1J to those of KBF are
compared for 11 iron-group nuclei considered in Ref. [90]. The ratios, λGXP /λKBF , for T9 =3 and ρYe
=107 g cm−
3, are found to be within the range of 0.4-2.4, which shows that the e-capture rates for
GXPF1J and KBF are close to each other within a factor of 2.5. The ratios, λGXP /λKB3G are 0.6-4.0
for the 11 nuclei [90], which shows that λKB3G deviates from λGXP more strongly than λKBF .

3.3 Nucleosynthesis of Iron-Group Elements in Type Ia SNe

The updated e-capture rates with the use of the GXPF1J are applied to study nucleosynthesis of iron-
group elements in Type Ia SNe. In single-degenerate models, thermonuclear burning propagates outward
as a subsonic ﬂame front known as a deﬂagration wave. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the ﬂame front
cause the enhancement of the burning in the surface area. In some cases, the deﬂagration is strong
enough to undergo a deﬂagration to detonation transition. The deﬂagration models and the delayed-
detonation models [79] are used for the supernova explosions. Nuclear reaction network calculations are
done for the central trajectories in the W7 deﬂagration and the WDD2 delayed-detonation explosion

are obtained for GXPF1J and KBF.

The double ratios R are obtained for the W7 and WDD2 models with the GXPF1J [89]. Notable
overabundance of 58Ni compared to the production of lighter Z nuclei is noticed for the W7 explosion
model. For the WDD2 model, the double abundance ratios for Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn isotopes are in
good agreement with the solar abundance within a factor of two as shown in Fig. 14(a). Overproduction
factors for nucleosynthesis of neutron-excess isotopes such as 58Ni, 54Cr and 54Fe, noticed for the case
with the FFN rates, are now found to be reduced to within a satisfactory range for the WDD2 model.
Similar results are obtained with the KBF for the WDD2 model [91]. The diﬀerence of the ratios
between GXPF1J and KBF is as small as 2% ans 4% for the WDD2 and W7 models, respectively.

Various SNe models can be distinguished by using observational constraints on nucleosynthesis of
iron-group elements, as the diﬀerence in the central densities of the WDs leads to diﬀerent elemental
and isotopic ratios in Type Ia SNe. The two types of explosion models are found to be consistent
with the observational constraints, in spite of their uncertainties. One set of observations is consistent
with the double-degenerate merger models for low central densities, while the other set favors the
single-degenerate models for higher central densities (see Ref. [92] for more details).

We now discuss the Coulomb (screening) eﬀects on the e-capture rates in pf -shell nuclei. The eﬀects
are evaluated in the same way as for the sd-shell nuclei explained in Sect.2.2. The weak rates including
the screening eﬀects are found to be reduced by about up to 20-40% compared to those without the
screening eﬀects, at the densities and temperatures shown in Fig. 13(a). The abundance yields of the
iron-group elements produced in Type Ia SNe with and without the screening eﬀects are compared
in Fig. 14(b) for the WDD2 model [93]. Here, thermonuclear electron screening eﬀects based on Ref.
[94] are included for both cases. The abundances of neutron-rich isotopes, such as 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr,
58Fe, 64Ni and 67,70Zn, are found to be smaller by 10-30% for the case including the screening eﬀects

contributions of Type Ia SNe to the solar abundances of these nuclei can be as high as 50

therefore important to take into account the screening eﬀects in discussing the origin of these nuclei.

4 Weak Rates for Two-Major-Shell Nuclei

4.1 Weak Rates in the Island of Inversion

Study of weak nuclear rates have been done mainly for nuclei in one-major shell by taking into account
the contributions from Gamow-Teller transitions. Here we extend our study to nuclei that involve
two-major shells and forbidden transitions. It has been pointed out that nuclear Urca processes are
3. Nuclear pairs
important in neutron star crusts [95], where the density is as high as 3-6
that can contribute to the neutrino cooling are mostly in the regions between the closed neutron and
proton shells, where nuclei are signiﬁcantly deformed. Therefore, two-major shells are involved in some
of these nuclei, for example, which belong to the island of inversion. In this section, the weak rates
for nuclei in the island of inversion, important for the Urca processes, are investigated by shell-model
calculations including the sd-pf shells.

Large sd-pf shell admixtures are found in neutron-rich Ne, Na and Mg isotopes near N=20. Lowering
of 2+
1 states and enhancement of E2 transition strengths show evidence for the breaking of the magicity

by the SDPF-M Hamiltonian [97] with sd-pf -shell conﬁgurations. Important contributions from 2p-2h
components are found in 30Ne and 32Mg.

density can not be clearly assigned for the weak rates in the case of SDPF-M, as the transition from the
g.s of 31Al (5/2+) to the g.s. of 31Mg is forbidden. This shortcoming can be improved for the eﬀective
interaction, EEdf1 [98], constructed from a chiral eﬀective ﬁeld nucleon-nucleon interaction at N3LO
using the extended Kuo-Krenciglowa (EKK) method [98] and from the Fujita-Miyazawa three-nucleon
forces [99]. The EKK method can properly treat in-medium ˆQ-box calculations in two-major shells
without divergence problems [100, 101], which occurred in the degenerate treatment of the orbits in
diﬀerent major shells. Energy levels of 31Mg are found to be well reproduced. The ground state proves
to be a positive parity state, 1/2+, and a low lying 3/2+ state is found at Ex =0.052 MeV close to
the experimental value of 0.050 MeV. More important roles of p-h excitations are noticed compared
to the conventional SDPF-M case. The 4p-4h components are found to be as important as the 2p-2h
components in 32Mg.

The weak rates are evaluated with the EEdf1 in the sd-pf shell, and they prove to be close to those
obtained by taking into account the experimental data as shown in Fig. 15(a) for the e-capture rates
on 31Al. Here, the GT transitions 31Al (5/2+, g.s.)
31Mg
(1/2+, g.s.) are taken into account. For the EKK approach, the Urca density can be assigned to be
log10(ρYe) =10.14 as shown in Fig. 15(b), thus leading to the nuclear Urca process for the A=31 pair,
and an appreciable cooling is expected to occur. An extension to other nuclei such as the A=33 nuclear
pair, (33Al, 33Mg), would be interesting.

4.2 Weak Rates for pf -sdg-Shell Nuclei

The e-capture rates in neutron-rich nuclei along and near N=50 are important for deleptonization
in stellar core-collapse processes [103], where evaluations of forbidden transitions in the pf -sdg shells
become crucial. When the electron-to-baryon ratio Ye rapidly changes from
0.28, nuclei
with mass A >65 dominate the evolution. Neutron-rich nuclei with the N=50 closed neutron shell
contribute most to the deleptonization. The weak rates for these nuclei are usually evaluated by RPA
or QRPA methods [104, 105, 106, 41, 107, 108], shell-model Monte-Carlo [109], or by using an eﬀective
rate formula with two parameters, the GT strength and the energy shift.
The eﬀective e-capture rate is given by the following formula [103],

=4.6, and the eﬀective energy diﬀerence parameter between ﬁnal and initial excited states is taken to
be ∆E =2.5 MeV [111].

Experimental studies of GT+ strength in nuclei with N=50 have been done for 86Kr and 88Sr by (t,
3He) reactions. The GT+ strength was found to be quite small due to Pauli-blocking of the N=50 core.
In 86Kr, a quite small GT strength up to Ex (86Br) = 5 Mev was obtained; 0.108+0.0631/-0.108 [112].
In 88Sr, no GT strength was found up to Ex (88Rb) = 8 MeV, and the strength amounted to 0.1
0.05
below Ex = 10 MeV.

±

However, the blocking of GT+ strength by the N=50 shell gap is found to be overcome in high tem-
peratures at T > 1010 K. Recently, thermal QRPA calculations based on thermoﬁeld dynamics (TFD)
formalism have been applied to neutron-rich N=50 nuclei [113]. Thermal quasiparticles are deﬁned with
respect to the thermal vacuum in the BCS approximation, and thermal phonons are constructed as lin-
ear superpositions of proton-neutron thermal two-quasiparticles. The e-capture processes are treated
as charge-exchange transitions from the thermal vacuum to the one-phonon states. In the TFD formal-
ism, both excitation and de-excitation processes at ﬁnite temperatures are naturally taken into account

1 MeV,
[107]. The GT+ strength is shifted toward lower excitation energies at high temperatures
and the contributions from the GT transitions are found to become larger than those from ﬁrst forbid-
den transitions in e-capture cross sections on 78Ni at log10(ρYe)
10. Similar unblocking of the GT+
strength across the Z=40 proton and N=50 neutron shell gaps is found also for the e-captures on 82Ge,
86Kr and 88Sr [114]. Correlations beyond thermal QRPA are shown to be important for further shift of
the GT+ strength to lower energy and enhancement of the e-capture rates in nuclei around 78Ni [115].
Electron-capture rates for neutron-rich nuclei around N =50 obtained by ﬁnite-temperature QRPA
calculations are also found to be enhanced compared with those of large-scale shell-model calculations
[116].

strengths and the rates are evaluated by shell-model calculations including pf -sdg shells, and compared
to the rates obtained by RPA. The shell-model calculations are performed with the use of the modiﬁed
A3DA interaction [117], which was originally constructed for pf -g9/2d5/2 conﬁgurations. Here, up to

g9/2d5/2 space, it was not possible to include the forbidden transitions in a satisfactory way. The
calculated sum of the strengths exhausts only 0.4%, 8% and 19% of the sum values, respectively. As
the contributions from the GT transitions from the ground state of 78Ni are quite small, they are not
included here. Inclusion of the shift of the GT+ strength in the ﬁnite-temperature formalism is beyond
the scope of the present study. Though the rates without the GT contributions are not realistic for core-
collapse processes at log10(ρYe) <11, contributions from the spin-dipole transitions become dominant at

of RPA calculations and the eﬀective rate formula in such a high-density region.

Electron-capture rates on 78Ni are evaluated by the multipole expansion formulae of Eqs. (10) and

temperatures T = (1-5)
operators are taken into account for 0− and 2− transitions, and also those of the axial electric and
vector magnetic operators for 2−. For 1− transition, the Coulomb, longitudinal and transverse electric
operators as well as the axial magnetic operator are taken into account.

Calculated results are shown in Fig. 16(b), and they are compared with those of an RPA calculation
with the SGII interaction [119]. Here, only the contributions of the transitions from the ground state
are considered. The same Q-value as for the shell-model is used for the RPA calculation. Here, the free
value gA = -1.26 is assumed for the axial-vector coupling constant.. Rates obtained by the shell-model
are larger than RPA results by about 30-80%, as we see from Fig. 16(b).

Cumulative sums of the spin-dipole (SD) and electric-dipole (E1) strengths are shown in Fig. 17 for
the shell-model amd RPA calculations. The shell-model SD strengths are shifted toward lower energy
region compared with the RPA in case of excitations of the 0− and 1− states, while the summed strength
by the RPA exceeds the shell-model result at Ex ≥
3 MeV for the 2− states. As for the E1 strength,
the shell-model results are larger than the RPA results at Ex > 2 MeV. In both cases, the dominant
contributions come from 1− states. These behaviors of the SD and E1 strengths lead to larger e-capture
rates for the shell-model than for the RPA.

When we compare the rates calculated in RPA with those obtained by the eﬀective rate formula,
Eq. (29), the ratios λef f /λRP A are found to be about 2 at lower temperatures and become close to 1
at T9 =50, except for the case of log10(ρYe) =12.0, where the ratio is 0.4-0.8. The shell-model rates are
rather close to those of the eﬀective rate formula. The energy shift parameter ∆E =2.5 MeV taken
in the eﬀective rate formula is close to the energy of the peak position of the sum of the SD strengths
in the shell-model calculations, as seen from Fig. 16(a), while the peak for the RPA is around Ex = 3
MeV as indicated by Fig. 17.

~r term in the axial longitudinal multipole. With these values of q, the shell-model rates are found
to be reduced about by 40% as shown in Fig. 16(c). Experimental information on the quenching of gA
for the SD transitions is not enough to determine a deﬁnite value for q. An eﬀective spin g factor gef f

strength in 48Ca obtained by backward electron scattering experiments [123]. This may suggest that it
is more reasonable to assume that strengths of SD transitions with λπ = 1− and 2− are also quenched
similar to the GT transition.

β-Decay Rates for N =126 Isotones for r-Process Nucleosyn-
thesis

The origin of elements heavier than iron is still one of the important open questions in physics.
It
has been known for more than half a century that about half of the elements heavier than iron are

32

produced via rapid neutron capture (the r-process) [124, 125, 126]. Recent studies conﬁrm that r-
process nucleosynthesis is the most promising answer to the question. However, the sites of the r-
process are still under controversy though there are several candidates such as magnetohydrodynamic-
jet (MHDJ) CCSN [127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133] and binary neutron star mergers (NSM) [134,
135]. In particular, much attention is paid to NSMs since the observation of a binary NSM through
a gravitational wave event (GW170817) and its associated short gamma-ray burst (GRB17087A) [136]
and electromagnetic emission, kilonova (AT2017gfo) [137, 138]. Neutrino-driven wind (νDW) CCSN
can be one of the candidates for weak r-process producing the elements with A
40) if an
appropriate condition for Ye, Ye < 0.5, is satisﬁed [139, 140]. However, recent core-collapse supernova
simulations show that the diﬀerence between averaged energies of νe and ¯νe gives a too small neutron
excess, yielding Ye > 0.5, which excludes νDW CCSN as an r-process site [141, 142]. Note that lower
n + e+ reaction results in less production of neutrons. Even the appearance
¯νe energy in the ¯νe + p
of a spherically symmetric νDW was not found in a recent long-term 3D supernova simulation [143].

Abundances of the elements produced in the r-process depend sensitively on various nuclear inputs
such as masses, neutron capture rates, ﬁssion yields, and β-decay rates especially at the waiting point
nuclei [144, 145, 146, 91]. Among them, the masses aﬀect the abundances most [147]. When β-decay
half-lives are changed by 1/10-10 times, the abundances can vary, that is, increase or decrease by an
order or more of magnitude [147]. The abundances depend also on astrophysical conditions; electron-
to-baryon number ratio Ye, the entropy and temperature of the explosion environment, and neutrino
processes [148, 149, 150, 91].

Here, we focus on β-decay rates and half-lives of nuclei at the waiting points and study their eﬀects
on the r-process nucleosynthesis. Studies of the β-decays of isotones with N=82 and N=126 have been
done by various methods including the shell model [151, 152, 153], QRPA/ﬁnite-range-droplet model
(FRDM) [104, 105], QRPA/ETFSI [154], HFB+QRPA [155], QRPA [156] and CQRPA [157]. The
half-lives obtained by these methods are found to be consistent to each other for N = 82 isotones. For
the case of N =126 isotones, on the contrary, the calculated half-lives vary stronger than for N=82
[91]. Moreover, experimental data for the masses, spectra and β-decays in this region of nuclei are quite
rare. The region near the waiting point nuclei at N=126 is therefore called the ′blank spot′ region.
First-forbidden (FF) transitions become important in addition to the GT transitions for the case of
N=126 isotones. Shell-model calculations have been done by including the contributions from both the
GT and FF transitions [152, 153].

The β-decay rates λ are obtained from the shape factors in Eqs. (32)-(35), and the half-life is given

by t1/2 = ln2
λ .

Half-lives of the isotones with Z =64-78 have been evaluated by shell-model calculations with the
use of a modiﬁed G-matrix [158, 159]. A closed N=126 shell conﬁgurations is assumed for the parent
nucleus. For neutrons the 0h9/2, 1f5/2,7/2, 2p1/2,3/2 and 0i13/2 orbits outside N=82 core are taken as
the model space, and a transition of a neutron to proton 1g7/2, 1d3/2,5/2, 2s1/2 and 0h11/2 hole orbits is
considered. The shell-model calculations are carried out with a certain truncation of the model space
and quenching of axial- and vector-coupling constants (see Ref. [160, 152] for the details). Calculated
half-lives are shown in Fig. 18, and compared with another shell-model result as well as those of FRDM
and GT2-KTUY. The half-lives obtained by the two shell-model calculations are consistent with each
other and agree very well with the results of GT2-KTUY, and are found to be short compared with
standard values of FRDM [104, 105]. The contributions from the FF transitions, mainly the νi13/2 →
πh11/2 transition, become more important for larger Z, and dominant at Z >72. They are crucial at
Z >75 to get reasonable half-lives compatible with the observation. The calculated half-life for Z=78
(204Pt), t1/2 = 38.3 s, is found to be fairly consistent with the experimental vale; 16+6/-5 s [161].
There are no even-odd staggerings in the shell-model half-lives, in contrast to the FRDM ones. This
comes from the monotonical dependence of the phase space factors on Z. The diﬀerence between the
Q-value and the mean energy of the strength decreases monotonically as Z increases. In another QRPA

almost all odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei on the neutron-rich side of stability are obtained by QRPA

are found for N=126 isotones, while predicted half-lives are longer by several times to one order of
magnitude compared with the present shell-model evaluations.

delayed neutron emission probabilities have been done with a relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB)
and proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-RPRPA) in a wide range
of neutron-rich nuclei [166]. Shorter half-lives, as compared to the FRDM/QRPA model, and important
roles of FF transitions are found for heavy nuclei in the region around N=126. The shorter half-lives
are shown to slightly shift the position of the third peak of the r-process nucleosynthesis abundances

of 197,198Os and 198Ir [170] as well as 194,196Os [171], produced by MNT reaction at KISS, are performed
to clarify the structure of these nuclei.

β-delayed neutron emission is important as additional neutrons are added to the r-process, and aﬀects
the the ﬁnal abundance pattern by modifyig the decay path back to stability and neutron ﬂux after
the freeze-out. While there are theoretical studies with the shell-model [153], FRDM/QRPA [104, 105],
QRPA [157] and relativistic HFB+QRPA [166], the calculated values of the branching ratios for one-
and two-neutron emissions (P1n and P2n) are rather scattered. Recently a systematic measurement
of the one- and multi-neutron emission probabilties in neutron-rich nuclei started at RIKEN, using a
high-eﬃciency array of 3He neutron countors (BRIKEN) [172], though there had been a number of
experimental works [173, 174, 175, 176]. For example β-delayed one- and two-neutron branching ratios
(P1n and P2n) have been measured in the r-process nuclei 86,87Ga at RIBF, RIKEN [177, 172]. An
extension of the present shell-model study on half-lives of N =126 isotones to nuclei in the ′blank spot′
region and evaluation of neutron emission probabilities is a challenging future problem.

6 Neutrino-Nucleus Reactions relevant to Nucleosynthesis and

Neutrino Detection

6.1

ν-Nucleus Reactions on 12C and 56Fe

In this section, we discuss ν-nucleus reactions relevant to nucleosynthesis in SNe and ν-detection. ν-
induced reaction cross sections measured in laboratory experiments are rather scarce, only on 12C and
56Fe up to now [178, 179, 180, 181]. We have updated ν-nucleus reaction cross sections based on recent
shell-model Hamiltonians for the p-shell and pf -shell. Both charged- and neutral-current reaction cross
sections in 12C induced by decay-at-rest (DAR) ν are successfully described by using GT and spin-dipole
(SD) transition strengths obtained by the SFO Hamiltonian for p-shell [182]. Especially, the exclusive
reaction cross sections 12C (νe, e−) 12N (1+, g.s.) induced by the GT transition [178] are quite well
reproduced by the SFO [183] at Eν = 35-55 MeV, as shown in Fig. 4 in Ref. [87]. Cross sections induced
by in-ﬂight νµ are also well described by RPA calculations [184].

In case of 56Fe, the charged-current inclusive cross sections for 56Fe (νe, e−) 56Co induced by DAR
ν are described well by hybrid models of shell-model and RPA [185]. Shell-model calculations with
GXPF1J and KB3G Hamiltonians are carried out for 0+ and 1+, while the RPA method is adopted
for other multipoles. Various evaluations of the charged-current cross section on 56Fe, such as RPA,
QRPA and hybrid models, are found to give cross sections consistent with the experimental data [186].

6.2 Nucleosynthesis by ν-Process

There are a few elements such as 7Li, 11B, 19F, 138La and 180Ta, which can not be produced by either
In pioneering work by Ref. [188], these elements are shown to be synthesized by
s- nor r-processes.

ν-process, where charged- and neutral-current reactions on nuclei play important roles [188]. ν-induced
reaction cross sections for these nuclei were updated in Ref. [189]. The use of accurate ν-induced
cross sections, including partial cross sections of particle emission channels, is important for reliable
predictions of the production yields of the elements. Here, branching ratios for each excited level
are calculated for decay channels involving single and multi-particle emissions by the Hauser-Feshbach
statistical model [190]. The production yields of the elements are also sensitive to the neutrino spectra.
This aspect should be carefully examined for a quantitative estimate.

Here, we ﬁrst discuss light-element nucleosynthesis using the cross sections obtained from shell-model
calculations with the SFO [183]. Light elements, 7Li and 11B, are produced through neutral-current
reactions (ν, ν′p) and (ν, ν′n) on 4He and 12C, respectively.
11B is produced through 12C (ν, ν’p)
11B and 12C (ν, ν’n) 11C followed by β−-decay. 7Li is produced through 4He (ν, ν’p) 3H followed by
α-capture, and 4He (ν, ν’n) 3He followed by α-capture and successive e-capture on 7Be. Most 7Li nuclei
are produced in the He-layer in SN explosions (SNe), while 11B nuclei are produced mainly in the O/Ne,
O/C and He layers. The production yields of 7Li and 11B, evaluated with the recent updated ν-induced
cross sections, are found to be enhanced compared to those of Woosley [182, 191]. When the energy
spectra of SN neutrinos are taken to be the Fermi distributions with temperatures at 3.2, 5.0 and 6
MeV for νe, ¯νe and νµ,τ , respectively, the enhancement factor for 7Li and 11B is about 15% [191]. The
temperature for νµ,τ was assumed to be higher before [188]; T(νµ,τ ) = 8 MeV. Recent studies on galactic
chemical evolution (GCE) with SNe support lower temperature of 6 MeV [192, 193].

Evolutions of luminosities and average energies of neutrinos in SNe after core bounce are studied
by numerical simulations for a variety of progenitor stellar masses, 13-50M

Dirac distributions up to Eν ∼
30 MeV, but have high energy tails originating in the accretion phase,
where the low density outer region has high temperature due to shock heating. Mean energies of emitted
neutrinos until 20 s after the core bounce are evaluated, and they are found to have a hierarchy, < Eνe >

4 MeV for the solar metalicity. The
eﬀects of this low temperature, T¯νe = Tνµ,τ = 4 MeV, on neutrino nucleosynthesis are investigated in
Ref. [195]. The production yields of 7Li and 11B, as well as its ratio 7Li/11B, are found to be considerably
reduced compared with those for the standard case, T¯νe = 5 MeV and Tνµ,τ = 6 MeV.

The eﬀects of the time-dependence of ν luminosities and ν energies on nucleosynthesis are investi-
gated in Refs. [196] by taking into account all the phases of SNe, that is, burst, accretion and cooling
phases. The burst and accretion phases, which give rise to high energy tails in the ν spectra, are
important for the prediction of production yields of elements, in particular, for the case of 138La and
180Ta. The use of time-dependent neutrino energies increases the production yields of the elements.
The assumption of constant neutrino energies averaged only in the cooling phase, as often used in pre-
vious literatures [188, 189], leads to a rather noticeable diﬀerence in the yields [196]. Inclusion of the
time-dependence for low neutrino energies leads to a slight reduction of the yields of 138La and 180Ta by
10-20%, compared to the case of neutrino spectra with higher energies as used here [196]. Considerable
reductions, obtained for the low neutrino energy spectra, remain for the yields of 7Li and 11B when the
time-dependence is taken into account.

11B can be produced also from ν-induced reactions on 16O; 16O (ν, ν’αp) 11B and 16O (νe, e− αp)
11C ( , e− ¯νe) 11B. As the cross sections for 16O (ν, ν’αp) 11B amount to be about 10% of those of 12C (ν,
ν′p) 11B, the production of 11B from 16O through αp emission channel is not negligible. The production
yields of 11B and 11C in SNe from progenitors with mass of 20M
are estimated to be enhanced about
⊙
by 16% and 8%, respectively, by the inclusion of multi-particle emission channels in 16O [197].

The element 19F is produced through 20Ne (ν, ν′p) 19F and 20Ne (¯νe, e+n) 19F. The magnitude of

36

the Q-value of the reaction 20Ne ( ¯νe, e+) 20F is

production from 20F is Sn = 6.601 MeV. The summed energy
+ Sn = 13.625 MeV is rather close
to the threshold energy for proton production from 20Ne, Sp = 12.84 MeV. Therefore, the (¯νe, e+n)
reaction on 20Ne can also contribute to the production of 19F, as the diﬀerence between the temperatures
for ¯νe and νµ,τ is small now.

138La and 180Ta are produced mainly by charged-current reactions 138Ba (νe, e−) 138La and 180Hf

The ground state (g.s.) of 180Ta (1+) is unstable and undergoes β-decay with a half-life of 8.15 hr,
and naturally abundant 180Ta is actually a metastable 9− isomer state at 77.1 keV with a half-life of
1015 yr. The g.s. (1+) and the isomer stae (9−) can couple via excitations of states at intermediate
≥
energies in astrophysical environments with ﬁnite temperature. In Refs. [199, 200], the g.s. and isomer
bands are treated as independent nuclear species, which are in thermal equilibrium amomg themselves
separately. The two bands are assumed to be weakly connected by a few linking transitions. The time
dependence of the population probabilities of the two bands is obtained by coupling them to each other
with a time-dependent temperature of exponential form, T = T0 exp(-t/τ ). The population of the
isomer band decreases with decreasing temperature. In the low-temperature freeze-out region (T9 <
0.44), the two bands are decoupled and the isomer population ratio becomes Pm/(Pm +Pg.s.) = 0.39. A
similar branching ratio has been estimated in Ref. [201]. The over-production problem of 180Ta is thus
solved with this branching ratio.

Besides the nuclei discussed above, 55Mn, 59Co, 92Nb and 98Tc can be produced via ν-process. The
production yields of Mn and Co produced in complete Si burning are aﬀected by neutrino processes
In addition to the reaction 54Fe (p, γ) 55Co, the neutral-current reaction 56Ni (ν, ν’p) 55Co
[202].
produces 55Co. 55Mn is produced through successive e-capture processes 55Co (e−, νe) 55Fe (e−, νe)
55Mn. As we discussed in Sect. 3, the GT strength in 56Ni has a two-peak structure with appreciable
high-energy tail. The proton emission channel opens at Ex = 10.1 MeV when the transition to the 1/2+
(2.92 MeV) state of 55Co begins to contribute to the cross section by emitting s-wave protons. The
calculated strength above Ex = 10.1 MeV amounts to be 62% of the total GT strength for the GXPF1J
Hamiltonian. Thus the cross section for 56Ni (ν, ν′p) 55Co is enhanced for the GXPF1J compared with
conventional cross sections obtained by HW02 [188] and KB3G, which leads to the enhancement of the
production yield of 55Mn compared with those for other Hamiltonians [203]. The calculated values of the
yields obtained in a SNe model of a population III star with M =15M
are found to be consistent with
-3 [204]. The proton knocked
the abundances observed in extremely metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]
out from 56Ni by the ν-induced reaction enhances the production yield of 59Co through the reaction
chain 58Ni (p, γ) 59Cu (e−, νe) 59Ni (e−, νe) 59Co, though the neutrino processes are not suﬃcient to
explain the observed data.

The isotope 98Tc with a half-life of 4.2

solar system formation. Production of 98Tc by ν-process in SNe has been investigated with QRPA
by taking into account both charged- and neutral-current reactions [209]. The dominant contribution
comes from the 98Mo (νe, e−) 98Tc reaction. The charged-current reactions induced by ¯νe, 99Ru (¯νe,
e+n) 98Tc and 100Ru (¯νe, e+2n) 98Tc, can contribute about 20% of the total production of 98Tc. The
calculated production yield of 98Tc is lower than the one which corresponds to the measured upper

limit of 98Tc/98Ru < 6
nuclear chronometer could be used to evaluate a much more precise value of the duration time from the
last core-collpase SN until the formation of the solar system. Finally, we comment that the production
yields of 92Nb and 98Tc are reduced by about 40% and 20%, respectively, remaining in the same order
of magnitude, if neutrino spectra with low temperatures, T¯νe = Tνµ,τ = 4 MeV, are used [195].

In proton-rich environment of SNe with Ye >0.5, which occurs during a few seconds after core bounce
[211], the α rich freeze-out of such proton-rich matter leads to the production of α nuclei such as 56Ni
with some extra protons. Subsequent proton captures induce rapid-proton capture process, proceeding
along the proton-rich region and producing light p-process nuclides such as 64Zn [212, 213]. However, the
process to heavier nuclides is suppressed by the increasing Coulomb barrier of the produced elements,
so-called waiting point nuclei such as 64Ge and 68Se. In the presence of intense ν ﬂuxes, ¯νe-capture on

The 64Ge (n, p) 64Ga reaction permits the matter ﬂow to continue to heavier nuclei with A > 64 via
subsequent proton capture up to the mass region A
80-100 [214, 215, 216]. Heavy p-nuclei such as
92,94Mo and 96,98Ru are produced by this rapid p-process. This nucleosynthesis process in proton-rich
environment is called the νp process.

6.3 Eﬀects of Neutrino Oscillations on Nucleosynthesis

We now discuss the eﬀects of ν ﬂavor oscillations on nucleosynthesis. In SN explosions, the Mikheev-
Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) matter resonance ν oscillations [217, 218] become important in case of the
normal (inverted) mass hierarchy for neutrinos (anti-neutrinos). The resonance condition for the MSW

temperature inherited from νµ and ντ . A part of ¯νe in the He layer is converted to ¯νµ and ¯ντ . This can
be expressed as [219]

N(νe) = P N 0(νe) + (1

In the case of an inverted mass hierarchy with sin2θ13 > 10−

3, ¯νµ and ¯ντ are converted to ¯νe near
the O/C layer, and most ¯νe in the He layer are those converted from ¯νµ and ¯ντ . A part of νe in the He
layer is converted to νµ and ντ . This is the case for (P, ¯P ) = (0.32, 0) in Eq.(37). When the adiabatic
condition is not satisﬁed, that is, sin2θ13 < 10−
3, considerable ﬂavor changes do not occur in the O/C
layer for both normal and inverted hierarchies.

In the case of a normal hierarchy, increase of the rates of charged-current reactions, 4He (νe, e−p)
3He and 12C (νe, e−p) 11C, induced by more energetic νe in the He/C layer, leads to more production
yields of 7Li and 11B through 4He (α, γ) 7Li and 11C ( , e+νe) 11B.

The dependence of the abundance ratio 7Li/11B on the mixing angle θ13 and the mass hierarchies

11B and 7Li isotopes have been discovered in SiC X-grains of Marchison Meteorite [225]. No signiﬁ-
cant enhancement of the ratio 7Li/11B is found for the SN grains. A statistical analysis of the meteorite
data was done with the Bayesian method, and the inverted mass hierarchy was found to be more pre-
ferred with a probability of 74% [226]. On the contrary, recent accelerator experiments at T2K and
NOvA suggest that a normal hierarchy is favored [227, 228]. The mass hierarchy can be sensitive to
the choice of neutrino spectra. The yield ratio 7Li/11B is found to be signiﬁcantly reduced when the
spectra with lower energies [195] are used. Further study on the sensitivity to the neutrino energies as
well as their time dependence during SNe might be needed before drawing a deﬁnite conclusion.

ν
Besides the MSW oscillation, collective oscillations of neutrino ﬂavors are induced by the ν
scatterings in a suﬃciently dense neutrino gas, such as the atmosphere above a proto-neutron star.
Some ideal cases including mean-ﬁeld approximations have been studied [229, 230, 231, 232, 233], and
applied to the r-process nucleosynthesis in a SN [234, 235] and black hole accretion disc [236].

Collective ν oscillations aﬀect the neutrino spectra in SNe. Bimodal instabilities lead to swapping
and splitting of the neutrino spectra [237, 238]. In case of inverted hierarchy for the two-ﬂavor mixing,
νe and νx swap each other at Eν > Esplit, resulting in more energetic νe. The ratio 7Li/11B is then
enhanced also for the inverted hierarchy. When both collective and MSW oscillations are taken into
account, the dependence of the ratio 7Li/11B on the mass hierarchy can be smaller and may lead to less
probability for the inverted hierarchy.

Eﬀects of collective ν ﬂavor and MSW oscillation on supernova nucleosynthesis are studied by taking
into account the time-dependent neutrino spectra and electron density proﬁles [239]. The ν oscillations
are shown to aﬀect the production of 138La and 180Ta as well as light nuclei such as 7Li and 11B, but
have little impact on the νp-process nucleosynthesis.

The abundances of 7Li, 11B, 92Nb, 98Tc, 138La and 180Ta produced by ν-process in a core-collapse
SN explosion are evaluated by taking into account both collective and MSW neutrino oscillations [240].
Time dependent neutrino spectra are obtained by considering the ν self-interaction near the neutrino
sphere and the MSW eﬀect in the outer layers. Abundances of 7Li and the heavy isotopes 92Nb, 98Tc
and 138La are reduced by a factor of 1.5-2.0 by the ν self-interaction, while 11B is relatively insensitive
to the ν self-interaction. The abundance ratio, 138La/11B, is found to be sensitive to the neutrino
mas hierarchy, and the normal mass hierarchy is more likely to be consistent with the solar meteoric
abundances. The ratio 7Li/11B remains higher for normal hierarchy by a factor of 1.24 when both the ν
self-interaction and MSW eﬀects are included. Note that results are rather sensitive to initial neutrino
parameters such as luminosities. Here, luminosities for νe and ¯νe are larger than those for heavy-ﬂavor
ν.

The eﬀects of collective neutrino oscillations on νp process nucleosynthesis in proton-rich ν-driven
winds have been studied by combining three-ﬂavor multiangle simulations with nucleosynthesis network
calculations [241]. Here, ﬂuxes for νe and ¯νe are assumed to be more abundant than those of heavy
ﬂavor neutrinos at the neutrino sphere, in contrast to the case of the supernova model in Ref. [239]. In
the early phase of ν-driven wind, blowing at 0.6 s after core bounce, oscillation eﬀects are prominent in
inverted mass hierarchy and p-nuclei are synthesized up to 106,108Cd. In the later wind trajectory at 1.1
10-104 times in normal mass
s after core bounce, abundances of p-nuclei are increased remarkably by
hierarchy, reaching heavier p-nuclei such as 124,126Xe and 130Ba. The averaged overproduction factor of

the collective oscillations, though the results depend on initial neutrino parameters and hydrodynamic
quantities such as wind velocities. The eﬀects of multi-azimuthal-angle instability [242, 243, 244], caused
by the violation of axial symmetry, on ν and νp processes are left for future study.

6.4 Neutrino-Nucleus Reactions for ν Detection

10 MeV. As the threshold energy for ν-induced reactions on 12C is

Recently, ν-induced reaction cross sections that are important for neutrino detection have been updated,
for example, for 13C, 16O and 40Ar. 13C is an attractive target for detection of very low energy neutrinos,
Eν ≤
13 MeV, neutrinos with
energy less than 13 MeV can interact only with the 13C isotope in natural carbon or carbon-based
scintillators. Natural isotope abundance of 13C is 1.07%, and ν-13C interactions are non-negligible in

reactor ¯ν (E¯ν < 8 MeV). Cross sections for charged- and neutral-current reactions to low-lying negative
and positive parity states of 13N and 13C have been updated [251] with the use of the SFO Hamiltonian
for p-sd shell, which proved to be quite successful in ν-12C reactions. Cross sections for GT transitions
are compared with those obtained by the Cohen-Kurath (CK) Hamiltonian for p-shell. A moderate
quenching for the axial-vector coupling constant gef f
A /gA =0.95 is enough, in contrary to the CK case,
which needs a substantial quenching factor of 0.69.

∼

An extension of the study to SN ν energy region is carried out for 13C [252]. The partial cross sections
for various γ and particle emission channels are obtained by using the Hauser-Feshbach model. In the
charged-current reaction 13C (νe, e−) 13N, the proton emission becomes dominant above the particle-
emission threshold energy. This partial cross section can be observed if the scintillator is capable of
pulse-shape discrimination. The reaction to the ground state of 13N is the second dominant channel,
while the neutron emission cross section is quite small.

In the neutral-current reaction, γ and neutron emission channels give large contributions to the
total cross section except for the elastic coherent scattering. Neutrons are detectable via the 2.2 MeV
photons emitted from thermal proton capture reaction, n + p
d + γ, and can provide a useful signal.
Note that neutron emission cross sections are much larger for the neutral-current reaction on 13C with
the threshold energy of Eth = 4.95 MeV compared to the reaction on 12C (Eth =18.72 MeV) by about
103-101 at Eν = 22-40 MeV.

→

One-neutron emission leading to 12C (0+, g.s.) is the dominant channel among the one-neutron
knock-out, while the channel leading to 12C (2+, 4.44 MeV) followed by γ (4.44 MeV) emission (Eth =

40

9.4 MeV) gives a contribution smaller by an order of magnitude or more at Eν < 30 MeV. Short-baseline
reactor neutrino experiments identiﬁed a shape distortion in 5-7 MeV range in the measured ν spectrum
[253], which appears as an excess over the predicted spectra. A beyond the Standard Model solution
to resolve this issue was proposed [254]: non-standard neutrino interactions induce the reaction 13C (¯ν,
¯ν′n) 12C (2+) followed by a prompt 4.44 MeV photon emission. The produced neutrons would then be
captured by protons, yielding scintillation light. It was proposed that this scintillation light along with
the prompt photon would mimic the spectral distortion around 5 MeV. The cross section obtained by
the Standard Model here would help to assess further investigation of such processes. The Standard
Model cross section is too small to be compatible with the solution proposed above.

Now, we discuss elastic coherent cross sections. The coherent scattering induced by the weak neutral
current is an important tool to test the standard model such as the value of the Weinberg angle, as
well as the possibility for non-standard weak neutrino-nucleon interactions. It is also a background for
detection of dark matter by neutrino scattering. Here, we focus more on nuclear physics aspects. The
coherent scattering can be a good probe of neutron density distributions in nuclei [255].

Event rates for the coherent elastic scatterings on 13C and 12C induced by DAR neutrinos are

estimated for one-year ν-ﬂuxes of 3
neutrinos, νµ, νe and ¯νµ, are taken into account. Experiments on natural carbon with 1.07% mixture of
13C and 13C-enriched target would give the event rates for each carbon isotopes separately. The event
rates for 13C and 12C as well as their diﬀerence are shown in Fig. 19. The diﬀerence of the event rates
between 13C and 12C is large enough to distinguish one-extra neutron in 13C. Cumulative sum of the
event numbers amounts to be about 11000, 16000, 18000 and 19000 up to the nuclear recoil energy

to distinguish the radius of neutron distribution in the nucleus to the accuracy of 0.1 fm. When the
radius of proton distribution in the nucleus is measured by electron scattering, the neutron skin of the
nucleus can be obtained and gives a crucial information on the equation of state of nuclear matter.

CRPA [262] except at low neutrino energy below 30 MeV. Partial cross sections for various particle
and γ emission channels are evaluated with the branching ratios to each excited states obtained by
the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. For (νe, e−X) and (ν, ν′X) reactions, the proton emission
channel gives the dominant contributions, while for (¯νe, e+X) reaction the neutron emission channel
and the transition to the ground state of 16N give the dominant contributions. The cross sections for αp
emission channels are found to be rather large in the shell-model calculations, in contrast to the case of

This point was discussed in Sect.6.2.

A possible signal for supernova νµ and ντ neutrinos in water Cerenkov detectors induced by neutral-
current reactions on 16O has been suggested [263]. Photons with energies between 5 and 10 MeV,
generated by (ν, ν′pγ) and (ν, ν′nγ) reactions on 16O, are shown to constitute a signal for a unique
identiﬁcation of the SN neutrinos. The yields of such γ events are evaluated by using the CRPA cross
sections, and a few hundred events are estimated to be detected in Super-Kamiokande for a SN at 10
kpc distance.

Event spectra of ν-16O charged-current reactions at Super-Kamiokande (SK) are evaluated for a
future SN neutrino burst [264]. The evaluations of the spectra as functions of electron or positron
energy are performed with and without the MSW ν-oscillations for an ordinary SN model with (M, Z)
= (20M
, 0.004). Here, M is
the progenitor mass and Z is the metallicity, and time-integrated ν spectra obtained in SN explosion
simulations are used [194]. The expected event numbers of 16O (νe, e−) X and 16O (¯νe, e+) X reactions
are estimated for a SN at a distance of 10 kpc with the use of the shell-model cross sections. The
event numbers increase with the ν-oscillation in the (νe, e−) and (¯νe, e+) channels, respectively, for the
normal and inverted mass hierarchy case for the ordinary SN model. In case of the black-hole forming
model, the impact of the ν-oscillation is found to be smaller as the total energy of heavy-ﬂavor neutrinos
is much less than the one carried by νe and ¯νe. In the case of (¯νe, e+), the inverse β-decay channel
has a large cross section and becomes the main background for the (¯νe, e+n) channel. The spectral
investigation of ν-16O charged-current events is challenging even in SK-Gd.

Liquid argon detectors have excellent potentialities to detect core-collapse supernova neutrinos,
especially by the 40Ar (νe, e−) 40K∗ reaction with tagging photons from excited states of 40K. A liquid
argon time projection chamber (TPC), proposed by ICARUS Collaborations [265], can provide three-
dimensional full particle track reconstruction with good energy resolution. Direct measurements of the
charged-current reaction cross sections on 40Ar are accessible by using a liquid argon TPC detector and
a spallation neutron source for neutrinos [266].

Gamow-Teller strength in 40Ar is studied by shell-model calculations [267] with monopole-based
universal interaction (VMU) [268, 269], which includes tensor components from π+ρ-meson exchanges.

The reaction cross sections for multipoles other than 0+ and 1+ are obtained by RPA. Their contri-

The cross section by the present hybrid model is enhanced by about 20-40% compared to Ref.

at Eν = 20-40 MeV, where the GT contributions dominate.

Exclusive cross sections for γ emission and various particle emission channels in 40Ar (νe, e−) 40K∗ are
evaluated by using the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model [274]. Two de-excitation modes, γ emission
and single neutron emission, are found to be dominant at Eν < 100 MeV. Tagging events involving
neutron emission could substantially improve energy reconstruction of supernova νe.

7 Summary

In this work, nuclear weak rates in stellar environments are obtained based on recent advances in shell-
model studies of both stable and unstable nuclei. Dominant contributions to the weak rates come from
spin-dependent transitions such as GT transition strengths, whose evaluations become more precise
owing to new shell-model Hamiltonians that can describe spin degree’s of freedom in nuclei quite well
with proper account of spin-dependent interactions. The weak rates, e-capture and β-decay rates, as
well as ν-nucleus reaction cross sections are thus improved and used to study evolution of stars and
nucleosynthesis in SN explosion (SNe).

The e-capture and β-decay rates in the sd-shell are evaluated with the use of the USDB Hamiltonian
[22, 23], and applied to study cooling and heating of the O-Ne-Mg cores in stars with 8-10 M
. The
e-capture rates increase while the β-decay rates decrease as the density increases. There is thus a
density where both rates coincide. When this density is almost independent of the temperature, it can
be assigned as the ’Urca density’ where the cooling becomes most eﬃcient by emitting both neutrinos
and anti-neutrinos. The nuclear Urca processes are found to be important for nuclear pairs with A=23
and 25, (23Na, 23Ne) and (25Mg, 25Na) pairs [22, 23]. Once the Urca processes are ignited in the core,
ﬁrst by the A=25 pair then by the A=23 pair, cooling of the O-Ne-Mg core proceeds by emitting νe
and ¯νe.

⊙

In later stage of the evolution, double e-captures on 24Mg and 20Ne occur and the core is heated by
the emitted γ’s [16]. There is a competition between the contraction of the core caused by e-captures
as Ye increases, and the heating of the core toward thermonuclear explosion. The standard scenario
is that the core contraction continues, and there occurs ECSNe and a NS is formed. Recently, it
was pointed out that the e-capture reaction 20Ne (e−, νe) 20F (2+
1 ) induced by the second-forbidden
transition may have important eﬀects on the ﬁnal fate of the core, i.e., whether thermonuclear explosion
or core collapse occurs [37]. We ﬁnd that the e-capture rates in 20Ne are considerably enhanced by the
second-forbidden transition at densities log10(ρYe) = 9.4-9.7 and temperatures log10T
8.8 [53, 52].
The multipole expansion method of Walecka [38, 40] and the Behrens-B¨uhring method [39] are used
to evaluate the weak rates for the second-forbidden transition. The relation between the two methods
is explained and diﬀerences in the calculated rates are shown. When the CVC relation is used for the
evaluation of the transverse E2 matrix element, the diﬀerence in the calculated rates is insigniﬁcant.
The diﬀerence becomes large at log10(ρYe)

9.6 for the case without the use of the CVC relation.

≤

The inclusion of the second-forbidden transition in 20Ne leads to an oxygen ignition, where the
energy production and neutrino energy loss become equal, earlier than in the usual case without the
second-forbidden contributions. The oxygen deﬂagration occurs at a certain density and temperature
somewhat higher than for the case of the oxygen ignition due to the convection eﬀects. Starting from
the deﬂagration, explosion-collapse bifurcations are examined by multi-dimensional simulations, and
the critical density ρcrt for the bifurcation is obtained [54]. If the central density at the deﬂagration
ρc,def is lower (higher) than the critical density ρcrt, thermonuclear (collapsing) ECSNe takes place. By
taking into account semiconvection and convection eﬀects, the value for ρc,def is estimated to be higher
than ρcrt. Thus, the core is likely to collapse with a remnant NS [54, 62]. Note that in Ref. [54] use
was made of the rates calculated in Ref. [53]. When the eﬀects of the convection are assumed to be
small, and ρc,def is taken to be close to the density at the oxygen ignition, the opposite conclusion is
drawn: thermonuclear ECSNe is more likely to occur with a remnant O-Ne-Fe WD [70, 37]. Further
investigation to clarify the transition from the oxygen ignition till the deﬂagration is necessary in future.
Nuclear weak rates in pf -shell are updated by shell-model calculations with the use of the GXPF1J
Hamiltonian, which can describe the GT strengths in Ni and Fe isotopes quite well [20]. In particular,
the experimental GT strength in 56Ni is well reproduced by GXPF1J [88]. Much amount of Ni and Fe
nuclides are produced in the last stage of the stars, that is, in supernova explosions. Precise evaluations
of the e-capture rates in pf -shell nuclei are important for the study of nucleosynthesis of iron-group

≈

nuclei in SNe. Here, the single-degenerate progenitor model is used for Type Ia SNe. Synthesis of
elements is evaluated by taking into account production yields of nuclides by SNe and galactic chemical
evolution (GCE). There was an overproduction problem of neutron-rich iron-group nuclei in Type Ia
SNe, when previous FFN e-capture rates [3] obtained by simple shell-model calculations were used.
In this case, the production yields of neutron-rich nuclei, such as 58Ni, 54Cr and 54Fe, exceed the solar
abundances by more than several times [79]. Once more accurate e-capture rates, obtained by improved
shell-model calculations, are employed, this overproduction is found to be considerably suppressed [89].
The production yields of these neutron-rich isotopes are now close to the solar abundances within a factor
of two. The screening eﬀects on the weak rates are also investigated. Their eﬀects on the production
yields of iron-group elements in Type Ia SNe are rather minor, as small as 10-30%. The e-capture
and β-decay rates, as well as neutrino energy-loss and gamma-energy production rates, evaluated by
the GXPF1J with and without the screening eﬀects are tabulated [93], so that they can be used for
astrophysical applications.

We also discuss the weak rates for nuclei that concern two-major shells, such as sd-pf and pf -sdg
shells. Some nuclear pairs in two-major shells are found to be important for the nuclear Urca processes
in neutron star crusts using QRPA evaluations [95]. The nuclear pair (31Mg, 31Al) is such an example
in the island of inversion. While the ground state of 31Mg is 1/2+, it was predicted to be 7/2− by the
sd-pf shell model Hamiltonian, SDPF-M, which was successful in describing spectroscopic properties of
even nuclei in the island of inversion [97]. Then, the g.s. to g.s. transitions become forbidden and the
Urca process does not occur. This situation is improved by using an eﬀective interaction in sd-pf shell
obtained by the extended Kuo-Krenciglowa (EKK) method [98, 100], which is free from the divergence
problem in G-matrix calculations in two-major shells [101]. Thus the transitions between the low-lying
states of 31Mg and 31Al are of GT-type, which leads to cooling by the nuclear Urca process [102].

The weak rates for isotones with N=50 were pointed out to be important for the core-collapse pro-
cesses in SNe [103]. The e-capture rates for nuclei at and around N=50 region are usually evaluated
with the RPA and QRPA methods. The spin-dipole transitions were found to give important contri-
butions. The full pf -sdg model space is necessary to evaluate spin-dipole transitions in nuclei with
N=50 in shell-model calculations. The spin-dipole strengths and e-capture rates for 78Ni are evaluated
by the shell-model with the use of a pf -sdg shell Hamiltonian, and compared with RPA calculations
and the eﬀective rate formula [118]. The rates obtained in the shell-model are enhanced compared
with those of the RPA by 30-80%, while they are found to be rather close to those obtained by the
eﬀective rate formula. The dependence of the results on the quenching of the axial-vector coupling
constant gA is also investigated. Comparison of the multipole expansion method of Walecka with the
Behrens-B¨uhring method is made, and the diﬀerence in the rates is found to be about 20%. Recently,
the thermal QRPA method, as well as the method including correlations beyond QRPA, were applied to
obtain the e-capture rates in neutron-rich N=50 nuclei, and unblocking of the GT transition strength
was found at high temperatures [113, 114, 115]. These eﬀects are not taken into account in this work.
More than half of the elements heavier than iron are produced by rapid neutron capture process
(r-process), but the sites of the r-process are still under controversy. Though the r-process is sensitive to
various nuclear physics inputs, here β-decay half-lives at the waiting point nuclei are studied by shell-
model calculations [153, 152]. In particular, focus is put on the half-lives of the isotones with N =126.
In case of N=126, the contributions from the ﬁrst-forbidden transitions are important in addition to
the GT transitions, in contrast to the cases of N =50 and 82. Calculated half-lives are short compared
with those obtained by the FRDM [104, 105], which are conventionally used as the standard values.
According to the measurements at RIBF, RIKEN, an overestimation of the half-lives predicted by the
FRDM is also found in neutron-rich nuclides in the A=110 region [165]. Eﬀects of the shorter half-lives
obtained in the shell-model on r-process nucleosynthesis are investigated in Refs. [160, 167]. Study of
neutron-rich nuclei around N=126, called ′blank spot′ nuclei, is in progress by multinucleon transfer
reactions [168, 169, 170, 171]. Another important nuclear physics input, the β-delayed neutron emission

46

probability, is also under investigation in several facilities of the world [172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177].

Neutrino-nucleus reaction cross sections relevant to nucleosynthesis and neutrino detection are up-
dated with the use of new shell-model Hamiltonians. Neutrino-induced reactions on 12C and 56Fe at
DAR energies are now well described by the SFO in the p-sd shell [182] and by the GXPF1J in the
pf -shell [186], respectively. The hybrid model combined with RPA for higher multipolarities is used for
56Fe and other pf -shell nuclei. Important roles of neutral-current ν-processes in producing 7Li and 11B
in SNe are pointed out [182]. Production yields of 7Li and 11B evaluated with the updated cross sec-
15 % compared with previous calculations [188]. 138La and 190Ta are produced
tions are enhanced by
mainly by charged-current reactions on 138Ba and 180Hf, respectively [198]. The coupling between the
unstable ground state (1+) and the metastable isomer state (9−) of 180Ta in astrophysical environments
at ﬁnite temperatures solves the overproduction problem of 180Ta, constrained by the measured GT
transition strength [199, 200]. Production of 55Mn, 59Co, 92Nb and 98Tc via ν-process is also examined.
Flavor dependence and hierarchy of average ν energies and ν luminosities produced in SNe as well as
their time dependence following the burst, accretion and cooling phases are important issues to obtain
precise production yields of the elements [194, 195, 196].

∼

Eﬀects of ν oscillations on nucleosynthesis in SNe are also investigated. The MSW matter oscillations
occur for normal ν-mass hierarchy. In the case of normal hierarchy, increase of the rates of charged-
current reactions on 4He and 12C induced by more energetic νe leads to higher production yields of 7Li
and 11B. The abundance ratio 7Li/11B is found to be enhanced for the normal mass hierarchy [191].
The inverted hierarchy is found to be more favorable according to a statistical analysis of the meteoric
data in SiC X-grains [226]. On the contrary, recent accelerator experiments at T2K and NOvA suggest
a normal hierarchy [227, 228]. As the production yields of 7Li and 11B are sensitive to the choice
of neutrino energy spectra and their time-dependence [195, 196], one should be careful for drawing a
deﬁnite conclusion. Element synthesis by ν-process in CCSNe has been studied by taking into account
both the MSW oscillations and the collective ν oscillations induced by ν-ν self interactions [239, 240].
The abundance ratio 138La/11B is found to be sensitive to the mass hierarchy, and the normal hierarchy
is more likely to be consistent with the solar meteorite abundances [240]. The ratio 7Li/11B remains
higher for normal hierarchy [240]. Eﬀects of the collective oscillations on νp-process nucleosynthesis are
also studied. The production of p-nuclei is found to be enhanced by the collective oscillations, which
depend sensitively on initial ν parameters and hydrodynamical quantities in SNe [241].

Nuclei such as 13C, 16O and 40Ar are attractive targets for the detection of SN and reactor neutrinos.
Neutrino-induced reaction cross sections on 13C in various γ and particle emission channels are evaluated
by the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model with the use of the SFO, which proved to be successful in 12C.
The 13C target is useful for detection of neutrinos with energies lower than 10 MeV, that is, reactor
neutrinos, since the threshold energy for ν-12C reaction is as high as 15 MeV [251]. As for 16O, the
partial cross sections for the various channels are evaluated with a modiﬁed version of the SFO, which
can well describe the spin-dipole strengths in 16O [197]. Properties of SN neutrinos and ν oscillations
can be studied by the measurement of γ’s as well as emitted neutrons. Event spectra of ν-16O charged-
current reactions at Super-Kamiokande are evaluated for a future SN neutrino burst with and without
the MSW ν-oscillation eﬀects [264]. Liquid argon detectors have a powerful potential to detect CCSN
neutrinos. Charged-current reaction cross sections for 40Ar (νe, e−) 40K∗ are updated by a new shell-
model Hamiltonian, which can describe well the experimental GT strength in 40Ar obtained by (p, n)
reaction [267].

Coherent elastic ν-nucleus scattering became accessible recently using a CsI scintillator [259]. While
the coherent scattering can be used to test the standard model, it can be a good probe of neutron
distributions in nuclei. Comparing cross sections and event numbers of the coherent scattering on 12C
and 13C, one can distinguish the eﬀect of one extra neutron in 13C [252]. Coherent elastic scattering
would be able to distinguish the radius of the neutron distributions in nuclei to the accuracy of 0.1 fm.
We have shown that the reﬁnements of the weak rates and cross sections have important impacts

47

on the study of various astrophysical processes. For nuclei around N=50, inclusion of transitions from
excited states is needed for high temperature astrophysical conditions of CCSNe, and its shell-model
study is a challenge for future. In the region of nuclei around N =126, an extension of the shell-model
calculations to various nuclei, such as in the ′blank spot′ region, and evaluation of neutron emission
probabilities is also an interesting challenge. Further progress in the evaluation of the rates in various
nuclear regions as well as in more extreme astrophysical environments would open up new advances in
nuclear astrophysics.
