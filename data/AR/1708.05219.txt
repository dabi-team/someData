Abstract 

We  report  on  the  superconducting  properties  of  molybdenum  nitride  thin  films  grown  by  reactive  DC 

sputtering at room temperature with a N2:Ar mixture. Thin films grown using 5 % N2 concentration display Tc 

= 8 K, which is gradually reduced and abruptly disappears for 40 % N2 concentration. This suppression can be 

associated with changes in the nitrogen stoichiometry from Mo2N to MoN. Our results provide an effective 

and  simple  path  to  prepare Mo2Nx  thin  films  with  tunable  Tc,  which  is  relevant  for  the  investigation  of  the 

fundamental properties and for technological applications.

1. Introduction 

Transition–metal nitrides (TMN) display a wide range of electronic and mechanical properties which are 

promising for technological applications. Superconducting TMN are potential candidates in a wide range 

of cryogenic devices like tunnel junctions [1] and electromagnetic radiation detectors [2]. The Mo nitrides 
present  several  superconducting  crystalline  phases:  g -Mo2N  (cubic)  with  Tc  ~  5  K  [3], b -Mo2N  (tetragonal) 
with Tc ~ 5 K [4] and d -MoN (hexagonal) with Tc ~ 12 K [5]. Different methods have been used in the growth 

of Mo nitride thin films, such as reactive sputtering [6,7], pulsed laser deposition [8], thermal nitration [9] and 
chemical routes [10]. A distinctive feature of g -Mo2N thin films is the influence of the disorder on Tc, which 

ranges from 4.5 K  to around 8 K for epitaxial and polycristalline thin films, respectively [11,12].  

In this letter, we show that the Tc in g -Mo2Nx thin films (grown by DC sputtering at room temperature) can be 

tuned  by  modifying  the  N2:Ar  mixture  used  during  the  sputtering  process.  Tc  in  thin  films  can  be  modified 

from 8 K to temperatures below 3 K by increasing the N2 partial pressure in the N2:Ar mixture from 5% to 

40%  of  the  total  pressure.  This  modification  can  be  associated  with  changes  in  the  nitrogen  stoichiometry 

from Mo2N to MoN.  

 
 
2. Material and methods 

2 

Mo2Nx films were deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering, starting from a pure Mo target in a N2:Ar 

gas mixture with N2 partial pressure going from 5% to 70% of the mixture’s 5 mTorr pressure. Films were 

grown on top of an 8 nm thick AlN buffer layer (grown with 20% N2 partial pressure), introduced to avoid 

any chemical reaction between the Mo and the native SiO2 layer of the Si wafers. During deposition the target 

to substrate distance was ~ 5.5 cm. The target power was 100 W (AlN) and 50 W (Mo-N). Ultra-high purity 

Ar (99.999%) and N2 (99.999%) were used as gas sources. The residual pressure of the chamber was less than 
10−6 Torr. No intentional heating of the substrate was used. Wherever used, the notation [MoNY%] indicates a 

Mo-N film grown with Y% N2 partial pressure. 

X-ray  (XRD)  difracction  data  were  obtained  using  a  Panalytical  Empyrean  equipment.  The  chemical 

composition  and  thicknesses  of  the  films  were  analyzed  by  Rutherford  Backscattering  Spectroscopy  (RBS) 
with  a  TANDEM  accelerator  using  a  2  MeV  4He2+  ion  beam.  RBS  spectrums  were  simulated  with  the 

SIMNRA code.  Surface composition analysis was performed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 

(XPS)  using  a  standard  Al/Mg  twin-anode,  X-ray  gun  and  a  hemispherical  electrostatic  electron  energy 

analyzer. The electrical transport measurements were performed using the standard four point configuration.  

3. Results and discussion 

XRD for thin films grown with N2/Ar mixtures £

 40 % show the 200 reflection corresponding to the cubic g -

Mo2N  structure  (see  Fig.  1a).  The  peak  is  systematically  sifted  to  smaller  angles  for  higher  N2  partial 

pressure,  which  indicates  a  larger  lattice  parameter  (see  Table  1).  The  microstructure  of  the  films  displays 

columnar  nanometric  grains  (diameter  smaller  than  10  nm)  textured  along  the  (100)  axis  [13].  No  X-ray 

reflections  were  identified  for  N2/Ar  mixtures  >  40%,  that  could  indicate  a  change  in  the  structure  of  the 

films.  For  Mo-N  films  grown  with  different  N2  partial  pressures,  the  electrical  resistivity  increases  with  T 
between 10 K and 300 K. The residual resistance ratio (RRR = R300K/R10K, with R the sample resistance) is in 

the  range  0.96-0.6,  systematically  decreasing  for  higher  N2  partial  pressures  (see  Table  I).  This  indicates  a 

very short mean free path l due to structural disorder (grain boundaries and chemical impurities). Figure 1b 

shows  the  dependence  of  Tc  with  the  N2  partial  pressure.  The  inset  in  Fig.  1b  shows  the  temperature 

dependence of the normalized resistance at T < 10 K for the superconducting films. The results show that for 

[MoN5%],  Tc  is  close  to  8  K  and  it  systematically  decreases  until  disappearing  for  [MoN40%],  The 

superconducting transition is sharp for all samples. Considering that all the analyzed films are thicker than 40 

nm, no contribution of their dimension on the Tc is expected [13].  

In order to understand the influence of the N2:Ar mix on the stoichiometry of the films, we have analyzed the 

chemical composition by RBS (see inset Fig. 1c). The drop in Tc can be correlated with changes in the Mo/N 

chemical  composition  (see  Fig.  1c).  The  RBS  results  show  that  for  [MoN5%]  the  stoichiometry  is  close  to 
Mo2N and it systematically decreases to MoN at [MoN40%]. MoN stoichiometry is expected for d -MoN [10].

The absence of Tc for N2/Ar> 40% could be attributed to an increment in the disorder and no crystallization of 
the hexagonal d -MoN. It is important to note that epitaxial g -Mo2N films with RRR ≈ 50 display Tc = 4.5 K  
[11] and polycrystalline g -Mo2N films with RRR < 1 display Tc = 8 K [11]. In addition, the Tc in [MoN5%] 
annealed up to 973 K decreases from 8 K to ≈ 5 K, which is close to the value reported for epitaxial films 

[11].  This  indicates  that  for  Mo-N  thin  films  grown  at  room  temperature  the  stoichiometry  is  a  relevant 

parameter  for  Tc.  On  the  other  hand,  increasing  the  N2  partial  pressure  affects  the  sputtering  rate,  which 
decreases from ≈ 22 nm / min for [MoN5%] to ≈ 10 nm/min for [MoN70%] (see Fig. 1d).  

XPS measurements were performed to obtain information of the chemical composition of the Mo-N films and 

the oxidation state of the Mo. The photoelectron peaks Mo3d, O1s, C1s and N1s were measured in detail. An 

overlapping of the N1s and Mo3p peaks was observed. The Mo3d binding energy region for each MoN film is 

shown  in  Figs.  2a-d.  The  spectra  were  fitted  using  a  Voight  function  for  each  peak  plus  a  Shirley-type 

background. The total fitted intensities along with the experimental ones are shown in each spectrum. In the 

[MoN10%]  and  [MoN20%]  Mo3d  spectra,  up  to  three  components  were  identified:  a  low  binding  energy 
d <4) associated with the compound Mo2N [14]), 
component at 228.5 eV (which could be ascribed to Mo
an  intermediate  component  at  ≈  230  eV  (which  could  be  attributed  to  Mo4+  associated  to  MoO2  impurities 
[15]),  and  a  high  binding  energy  component  at  232.7  eV  (ascribed  to  the  presence  of  Mo6+  due  to  the 

d + (2£

formation  of  MoO3  in  the  surface  [16,15]).  The  doublet  associated  to  the  presence  of    MoO3  can  be 

completely removed after a sputtering process, which indicates its surface nature [13]. The Mo3d spectra at 
d +. In the [MoN35%] and [MoN50%], Mo3d spectra display 

[MoN10%] and [MoN20%] are dominated by Mo

a new component at 229.1eV, which can be ascribed to MoN [17]. This new component shifts the envelope of 

the Mo3d5/2 peak to higher binding energy, as observed by Wang et al. [14]. 

Figure  3  shows  Hc2(T)  with  the  magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  the  surface  for  [MoN5%],  [MoN10%], 

[MoN20%] and [MoN30%]. Inset Fig. 3 shows typical resistivity vs. temperature curves for different applied 

magnetic fields (H) in [MoN30%]. The temperature dependence of 

2cH can be analyzed by the Werthamer-

Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model developed for dirty one-band superconductors [18], which predicts

with  a

supercurrents  circulating  around  the  vortex  cores.  The  results  show  that,  independently  of  Tc,  all  the  films

present Hc2(0) around 12 T (see Fig. 3 and Table I). This value is close to the one expected from the Pauli 
limit Hp≈ 1.84 Tc [20] and corresponds to a coherence length of x  (0) ≈ 5.2 nm.  

4. Conclusions  

In summary, nanocrystalline superconducting Mo2Nx thin films with RRR < 1 have been successively grown 

at room temperature by reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The Tc of the films can be tuned from 8 K to below 

3 K by modifying the reactive N2:Ar composition. The drop in Tc can be attributed to changes in the Mo/N 
stoichiometry in the films. Thin films with Tc > 6 K display Hc2 (0) ≈ 12 T and x  (0) = 5.2 nm.
