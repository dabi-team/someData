We  report  that  annealing  in  low-oxygen-partial-pressure  (low-pO2)  ambient  is  effective  in 

reducing the interface state density (DIT) at a SiC (0001)/SiO2 interface near the conduction 

band edge (EC) of SiC. The DIT value at EC − 0.2 eV estimated by a high (1 MHz)-low method 

is  6.2×1012  eV-1cm-2  in  as-oxidized  sample,  which  is  reduced  to  2.4×1012  eV-1cm-2  by 

subsequent  annealing  in  O2  (0.001%)  at  1500◦C,  without  interface  nitridation.  Although 

annealing in pure Ar induces leakage current in the oxide, low-pO2 annealing (pO2 = 0.001 - 

0.1 %) does not degrade the oxide dielectric property (breakdown field ~ 10.4 MVcm-1).

Silicon carbide (SiC) is a suitable material for power device applications, owing to its superior 

physical properties, such as wide bandgap, high critical electric field, and high thermal conductivity.1,2) 

A unique advantage of SiC over other compound semiconductors is that it can be thermally oxidized 

to  give  high-quality  silicon  dioxide  (SiO2).2)  Thus,  SiC  metal-oxide-semiconductor  field  effect 

transistors  (MOSFETs)  have  attracted  much  attention  for  low-loss  and  fast  power  switches.  SiC 

MOSFETs  have,  however,  suffered  from  the  low  channel  mobility  due  to  the  high  interface  state 

density (DIT, ~ 1013 eV-1 cm-2) of SiC/SiO2 systems.2-7)   

Although  the  physical  origin  of  the  interface  states  remains  uncertain,  several  methods  were 

found to passivate the defect levels. For instance, post-oxidation annealing in nitric oxide (NO)8,9) or 

nitrous  oxide  (N2O)10,11)  (interface  nitridation)  or  in  a  gas mixture  of  phosphoryl  chloride  (POCl3), 

oxygen  (O2),  and  nitrogen  (N2)12)  (POCl3  annealing)  is  effective  in  reducing  the  DIT  near  the 

conduction band edge (EC) of SiC. However, since these methods rely on the incorporation of foreign 

atoms (nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P)), generation of extrinsic defects at the interface and in the oxide 

have been pointed out as a problem. By interface nitridation, generation of very fast interface states13) 

and oxide hole traps14) was indicated, and for POCl3 annealing, generation of electron and hole traps 

in the oxide15) was suggested. 

2 

 
It is more desirable if high-quality interface can be obtained without introducing foreign atoms 

into the interface and oxide. In recent years, ultrahigh-temperature oxidation (~ 1400 - 1600◦C),16) thin 

(~ 15 nm) oxidation with rapid cooling (> 600◦C/min),17) and post-oxidation argon (Ar) annealing18) 

have  been  reported  to  be  effective  in  reducing  the  interface  states,  without  introduction  of  foreign 

atoms. In this study, we demonstrate that the DIT reduction by the post-oxidation Ar annealing is not 

the effect of “pure” thermal annealing but the effect of unintentional very-low-oxygen-partial-pressure 

(pO2) annealing. 

Samples employed in this study were n-type SiC (0001) MOS capacitors (donor concentration 

(ND): ~ 1016 cm-3). Oxides were formed by dry oxidation at 1300◦C for 30 min followed by annealing 

in either pure Ar or Ar containing very small amount of oxygen (O2) (0.001 - 0.1%; low-pO2) at 1300 

-  1500◦C  for  1  min.  In  the  case  of  pure-Ar  annealing, Ar was  purified  so  that  the  concentration  of 

contained  oxygen  was  below  100  ppt.  For  low-pO2  annealing,  the  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  was 

strictly controlled by supplying a gas directly from a gas cylinder containing the mixture gas of Ar and 

O2. The low-pO2 annealing was performed in an induction heating furnace with a fast cooling rate (> 

600  ◦C/min),  in  order  to  minimize  the  additional  oxidation  during  the  cooling  phase.  The  oxide 

thicknesses were about 51 - 58 nm and the gate electrodes were aluminum (Al) (diameter: 0.5 - 1 mm). 

3 

 
All of the measurements were conducted at room temperature. 

Figure  1  shows  the  current  density-electric  field  (J-E)  characteristics  of  the  prepared  MOS 

capacitors. Here, the oxide electric field, EOX, was estimated by EOX = V/tOX, where V and tOX are the 

applied  voltage  and  the  oxide  thickness,  respectively.  We  see  that  the  as-oxidized  and  low-pO2-

annealed  samples  exhibit  typical  J-E  characteristics  with  Fowler-Nordheim  (F-N)  tunneling 

current2,19)  at  a  sufficiently  high  oxide  field  (>  7  MVcm-1).  In  contrast,  a  high  leakage  current  is 

observed even at a very low field (< 0.2 MVcm-1) in the case of pure-Ar-annealed sample. 

In  order  to  clarify  the  origin  of  the leakage  current,  secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry  (SIMS) 

measurements  were  performed.  Figure  2  depicts  the  depth  profiles  of  carbon  concentration  in  the 

SiC/SiO2 samples acquired by SIMS. After annealing in pure Ar, a high concentration of carbon atoms 

(> 1020 cm-3) is detected in the oxide, as reported in Ref. 6. Note that such a pure Ar ambient cannot 

be realized simply by introducing Ar immediately after the oxidation process, since residual oxygen 

remains in the oxidation furnace. In our case, we excluded the effect of oxygen by performing the Ar 

annealing in a leak-tight resistive heating furnace which is different from the oxidation furnace. In the 

case of low-pO2-annealed sample, the carbon concentration in the oxide is close to the detection limit 

(~ 1018 cm-3). Thus, carbon atoms are ejected from the interface during the annealing, and they remain 

4 

 
in the oxide in the case of pure Ar annealing, which leads to the severe degradation of oxide dielectric 

property (Fig.1). In the case of low-pO2 annealing, slight oxygen (0.001 - 0.1%) removes the ejected 

carbon atoms by oxidizing them into gas species such as CO or CO2, leading to the suppression of the 

leakage current (Fig.1). 

Figures 3 (a) and (b) show the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of the MOS capacitors; 

annealed in the temperature range of 1300 - 1500◦C in (a) O2 (0.001%) and in (b) O2 (0.1%). Both the 

frequency dispersion and C-V stretch-out are reduced by the low-pO2 annealing, which is indicative of 

reduction  of  DIT  near  EC. The  effective  fixed  charge  densities  estimated  from the  flat-band  voltage 

shift  were  2.4×1012  cm-2  (negative)  and  1.2×1012  cm-2  (positive)  in  the as-oxidized  sample  and  the 

sample annealed in O2 (0.001%) at 1500◦C, respectively.   

Energy distributions of DIT extracted by a high (1 MHz)-low method19) are compared in Fig.4. In 

the case of annealing in O2 (0.001%), the DIT is effectively reduced by increasing the temperature, and 

takes its minimum values (e.g. 2.4×1012 eV-1cm-2 at EC − 0.2 eV) after annealing at 1500◦C. For O2 

(0.1%) annealing, in contrast, the DIT at EC − 0.2 eV increases from 4.9×1012 eV-1cm-2 to 6.3×1012 eV-

1cm-2 by increasing the temperature from 1300◦C to 1500◦C. The oxide thicknesses of the as-oxidized 

and low-pO2-annealed samples determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry are summarized in Fig.5. We 

5 

 
see that the oxide thickness hardly changes (< 1 nm) with the annealing in O2 (0.001%), whereas, the 

thickness increases by about 6 nm with annealing in O2 (0.1%) at 1500◦C. Such results indicate that 

the DIT is determined by the balance of the removal and creation of the interface defects during the 

low-pO2  annealing,  and  that  it is  important  to  avoid  excessive  oxidation  of  SiC  during  the low-pO2 

annealing to suppress additional defect generation. Note that, in SiC MOS systems, it is known that 

the incorporation of impurities, such as boron (B),20) P,12) and sodium (Na),21) in a high concentration 

of about 1020 - 1021 cm-3 leads to remarkable reduction of DIT.12,20,21) From SIMS measurements, we 

confirmed that the concentration of B, P, and Na atoms near the SiC/SiO2 interface is at least below 

2×1016  cm-3  after  the  low-pO2  annealing, indicating  that the  observed  DIT  reduction  by  the  low-pO2 

annealing (Fig.4) is not due to the impurity contamination.   

We indicated that a high density of positive fixed charge (1.2×1012 cm-2) resides in the sample 

annealed in O2 (0.001%) at 1500◦C. It should be noted that, it is difficult to estimate the real positive 

fixed charge density simply from the flat-band voltage shift in the case of as-oxidized sample, since 

electrons  trapped  at  the  acceptor-like  interface  states  act  as  “effective”  negative  charge  and 

compensates the positive charge. Thus, the positive charge may even reside in the as-oxidized sample 

and may become apparent by the low-pO2 annealing owing to the reduction of acceptor-like interface 

6 

 
states (Fig.4). 

        Here, we discuss the possible atomistic configurations of the major interface defects in SiC/SiO2 

systems. It has widely been believed that the carbon byproducts at (or near) the interface are the origin 

of interface states in SiC MOS structures,2,6,16,17,22-27) since carbon is one of the host atoms of SiC. We 

confirmed  that  a  high  concentration  of  carbon  atoms  is  ejected  from  the  interface  by  the  pure Ar 

annealing (Fig.2), which also suggests that the interface defects are related to carbon species. A result 

of  density-functional  calculations indicates  that,  among  the  various  forms  of  carbon  atoms  that are 

frequently observed at a SiC/SiO2 interface during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations28), ethylene-

like  structure  (SiO>C=C<SiO)  creates  defect  levels  near the  EC  of  SiC.23)  Si2>C=C<Si2  defect24-27) 

and Si2>C=O defect24) are also possible candidates, since they also create defect levels near the EC. It 

is also suggested that oxygen helps the dissociation of interface carbon defects by reducing the energy 

of the structure after the dissociation by terminating the Si dangling bonds at the interface.23) Thus, the 

low-pO2  annealing  may  reduce  the  DIT  near  EC  (Fig.4)  by  dissociating  the  carbon  defects  while 

preventing the additional generation of carbon defects caused by excessive oxidation of SiC. 

        In  conclusion,  we  found  that  low-pO2  annealing  is  effective  in  reducing  the  DIT  at  a  SiC 

(0001)/SiO2 interface  without introduction of  foreign atoms. For annealing in O2 (0.001%), the DIT 

7 

 
decreased  by  increasing  the  temperature  up  to  1500◦C,  whereas,  for  O2  (0.1%)  annealing,  the  DIT 

increased by increasing the temperature from 1300◦C to 1500◦C. The oxide thickness hardly changed 

(<  1 nm)  with  the  annealing  in  O2  (0.001%),  whereas  the  thickness  increased  by  about  6  nm  with 

annealing in O2 (0.1%) at 1500◦C. Thus, during the low-pO2 annealing, it is of importance to remove 

the interface defects by oxidizing them, while preventing the excessive oxidation of SiC to minimize 

additional defect creation. In the case of pure Ar annealing, carbon atoms are ejected from the interface, 

and they remain in the oxide, which leads to the severe degradation of oxide dielectric property. In 

low-pO2 annealing, however, slight oxygen (0.001 - 0.1%) removes these carbon atoms by oxidizing 

them into gas species such as CO or CO2, leading to the suppression of the leakage current.
