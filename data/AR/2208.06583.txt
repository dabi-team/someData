Double universality of the transition in the supercritical state

Universality aids consistent understanding of physical properties. This includes understanding the
states of matter where a theory predicts how a property of a phase (solid, liquid, gas) changes with
temperature or pressure. Here, we show that the matter above the critical point has a remarkable
double universality not limited by pressure and temperature. The ﬁrst universality is the transition
between the liquidlike and gaslike states seen in the crossover of the speciﬁc heat on the dynamical
length scale in deeply supercritical state and characterised by a ﬁxed inversion point. The second
universality is the operation of this eﬀect in many supercritical ﬂuids, including N2, CO2, Pb, H20
and Ar. Despite the diﬀerences in structure and chemical bonding in these ﬂuids, the transition
has the same ﬁxed inversion point deep in the supercritical state. This provides new understanding
of the supercritical state previously considered to be a featureless area on the phase diagram and
a theoretical guide for improved and more eﬃcient deployment of supercritical ﬂuids in green and
environmental applications.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Our view of the phase diagram of ordinary matter is
dominated by the three states of solid, liquid, and gas,
and the ﬁrst order phase transition lines between them
which branch out from the triple point. Of these phase
transitions, two possess coexistence lines which are ﬁ-
nite in length, including the solid-gas sublimation line
and the liquid-gas boiling line terminating at the critical
point. The matter above the critical point, the supercrit-
ical matter, was not thought of as a distinct state of mat-
ter, instead seen as a homogeneous state intermediate to
liquids and gases and lacking transitions. In particular,
distinction between liquidlike and gaslike states within
this region was thought to be impossible [1, 2]. Critical
anomalies such as the heat capacity maxima do not per-
sist far beyond the critical point and furthermore depend
on the path taken on the phase diagram [3, 4]. Under-
standing both the supercritical and liquid states involves
several fundamental problems related to dynamical disor-
der and strong inter-molecular interactions [1, 4–8]. Yet
such understanding is believed to enhance the deploy-
ment of supercritical ﬂuids in important green and envi-
ronmental applications [2, 9–13].

The Frenkel line separates two qualitatively dynamical
regimes of particle motion: combined oscillatory and dif-
fusive motion below the line and purely diﬀusive above
the line [14]. Practically, the line is calculated from either
the dynamical criterion based on the minima of velocity
autocorrelation function or the thermodynamic criterion
based on the disappearance of transverse modes. This
separation of the supercritical state into two diﬀerent
states involves a physical model. It is interesting to ask
whether this separation can also be done in a way which
is model-free? A related question is whether the separa-
tion involves universality across all supercritical systems
in terms of suitably identiﬁed physical parameters?

Here, we show that deeply supercritical state has
a clearly identiﬁable transition between liquidlike and
gaslike states seen in the dependence of the speciﬁc heat

cV on the dynamical length λd which is doubly-universal.
The ﬁrst universality is a ﬁxed path-independent inver-
sion point of the cV (λd) crossover, seen as the change
of the sign of the derivative of cV with respect to λd.
The second universality is that the location of the in-
version point is similar in all simulated ﬂuids, includ-
ing supercritical N2, CO2, Pb, Ar and to some extent
in H2O. Supercritical water has an anomaly, displaying
similarities but also diﬀerences to the other systems in
which the universal transition is identiﬁed. The inversion
point therefore constitutes a system-independent, path-
independent, and an unambiguous separation between
two physically distinct supercritical states.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Speciﬁc heat and dynamical length

Using molecular dynamics simulations (see the “Meth-
ods” section for detail), we have simulated several ﬂuids
with diﬀerent structure and chemical bonding in order
to ascertain the eﬀect in a wide range of systems. We
simulate molecular (N2, CO2), metallic (Pb), hydrogen-
bonded network ﬂuid (H2O) and noble Ar. Supercrit-
ical CO2 and H2O are particularly important from the
industrial point of view due to their deployment in ex-
tracting, cleaning, dissolving, environmental and green
energy applications [2, 11–13]. We simulate these ﬂu-
ids along several isobars, isotherms, and isochores in the
deep supercritical state.

We zero in on the dependence of the speciﬁc heat cV
on the dynamical length λd = cτ , where τ is liquid relax-
ation time [15] (for details of calculation and interpreta-
tion of τ , see the Methods section) and c is the transverse
speed of sound. The speciﬁc heat, cV (heat capacity per
atom), is an obvious important choice of a thermody-
namic quantity because it reﬂects the degrees of freedom
in the system. The role of the dynamical length λd is
that it sets the upper range of wavelengths of transverse

kB = 1.

phonons in the liquidlike regime of supercritical dynamics
below the Frenkel line (FL) [14]. Details of this mech-
anism are given in the Methods section. In the gaslike
dynamics above the FL, λd corresponds to the particle
mean free path and sets the wavelength of the remaining
longitudinal mode. This way, λd governs the phase space
available to phonons in the system. Since the energy of
these phonons contributes to liquid cV [4–8], we predict
a unique universal relationship between cV and λd in the
supercritical state.

We show the calculated plots of cV on λd in nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, lead and water in Figs. 1-4. We set
kB = 1 everywhere in the paper. The variation of cV and
λd shown in these Figures corresponds to a very wide
range of pressure and temperature. To illustrate this,
we also plot several representative paths simulated on
the pressure and temperature phase diagram using the
argon data [16] in Fig. 5 and the corresponding plot cV
vs λd in Fig. 6.

The dependence of cV on λd across all simulated paths
nearly collapses onto a group of “c”-shaped curves, which
we refer to as the main sequence. The main sequence is
“c”-shaped and has an inversion point corresponding to
the change of the sign of the derivative of cv with respect
to λd.

The origin of the inversion point is as follows. The
dynamical length always has a minimum as a function
of temperature when crossing from liquidlike to gaslike
regimes of particle dynamics. Recall that this crossover
is related to the dynamical crossover at the Frenkel line
(FL) [14]. In the liquidlike regime below the FL, parti-
cle dynamics combines oscillatory motion around quasi-

the supercritical state up to 20 times the critical pressure and

the main sequence but with path dependence remaining. The
diﬀerent paths exhibit the same qualitative behaviour and
share an inversion point of cV ≈ 2.0 and λd ≈ 1 ˚A.

equilibrium positions and ﬂow-enabling diﬀusive jumps
between these positions [15].
In this regime, τ and
λd = cτ decrease with temperature. In the gaslike regime
above the FL, the oscillatory component of particle mo-
tion is lost, leaving the diﬀusive jumps only [14]. In this
regime, λd becomes the particle mean free path which
increases with temperature (see the Methods section for
more details). The inversion point is therefore related

supercritical water along 8 phase diagram paths spanning the
supercritical state up to 15 times the critical temperature and
500 times the critical pressure, showing signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in behaviour between diﬀerent phase diagram paths including
the location of the inversion point in cV and λd.

FIG. 6: Speciﬁc cV as a function of the dynamical length,
λd = cτ across 9 paths spanning the supercritical state of ar-
gon up to 300 times the critical temperature and 8000 times
the critical pressure. The data are from Ref. [16]. All these
paths collapse onto the main sequence curve, thereby un-
dergoing a uniﬁed dynamic-thermodynamic transition at the
path-independent inversion point cV ≈ 1.9 and λd = 1 ˚A.

comitantly, particle dynamics can be viewed as the mo-
tion with the particle mean free path approximately equal
to the interatomic separation.

The value of cV of about 2 in monatomic argon and
lead is important too. cV = 2 corresponds to the loss
of the contributions from the two transverse phonon
(cid:1) and the
branches, with only the kinetic part (cid:0)cV = 3
potential part of the longitudinal mode (cid:0)cV = 1
(cid:1) remain-
ing. Since this loss corresponds to the disappearance of
the oscillatory component of particle motion, cV = 2 is
taken as a thermodynamic criterion of the FL [8, 14].
Phonon anharmonicity can change this result by a rela-
tively small amount [8], and the disappearance of trans-
verse modes corresponds to cV = 2 approximately. The
inversion point in nitrogen and carbon dioxide corre-
sponds to cV = 2.8−2.9 (in molecular systems, cV is heat
capacity per molecule) due to the additional rotational
term contributing 1 to cV . Subtracting 1 from calculated
cV , we arrive at cV = 1.8 − 1.9 as in monatomic ﬂuids.

We note that the c-plot is not limited in pressure and
temperature as long as the system remains chemically
unaltered (the same proviso as for the melting line), ex-
tending to the entire supercritical state of matter.

All phase diagram paths of diﬀerent types in argon,
nitrogen and carbon dioxide collapse onto the main se-
quence curve. As discussed in the next section in more
detail, cV (λd) along diﬀerent phase diagram paths fol-
lows the same “c”-shape of the main sequence in lead
but moderate path dependence remains far from the in-
version point. This could be related to the electronic
contribution (not accounted for in the theory based on

and temperature points for argon. Also labelled are the state
points where the transition at the inversion point takes place.

and melting lines are shown.

to the transition between liquidlike and gaslike particle
dynamics.

The values of λd and cV at the inversion point are phys-
ically signiﬁcant. The value of λd = 1 ˚A corresponds to
the ultraviolet cutoﬀ, approximately equal to the short-
est length scale in the condensed matter system: the in-
teratomic separation set by the length of the chemical
bond. When λd matches this lengthscale, the ﬂuid stops
supporting all transverse phonons simply because the
modes with shorter wavelength are non-existent. Con-

tential in classical MD simulations.

Water, however, shows a diﬀerent behavior in Figure
4. This is not unexpected, given that water possesses
many anomalies which continue to inspire enquiry and
research [17, 18]. Water’s supercritical state is little un-
derstood despite extensive exploitation in industrial and
environmental applications [2, 11–13]. The speciﬁc heat
of liquid water at the melting point at atmospheric pres-
sure is almost twice as high as that of ice and is related
to large “conﬁgurational” contribution to the liquid heat
capacity. This contribution is related to water-speciﬁc
hydrogen-bonded network undergoing the coordination
change from 4 to 6, with the associated contribution to
entropy and speciﬁc heat [19]. This eﬀect precludes the
description of water’s heat capacity using phonons only
as discussed earlier. Although diﬀerent paths still result
in the c-shaped curves, we see signiﬁcant path depen-
dence in Fig. 4. cV at the inversion point varies in the
range of about 5-6 per molecule. This higher cV can be
understood as a result of the additional conﬁgurational
term in water mentioned earlier as well as the rotational
term. Nevertheless, the inversion points corresponds to
λd close to 1 ˚A as in previous ﬂuids.

B. Path dependence

The universality of the inversion point and “c”-shaped
main sequence curves observed in the previous section
is best taken in the context of the path dependence of
cV as a function of parameters other than the dynam-
ical length λd. In this study we performed simulations
along isobars, isotherms, and isochores. The dynamical
parameter τ , the relaxation time introduced in the main
article, provides a way to compare cV vs τ along diﬀer-
ent paths. In Fig. 7 we observe substantial path depen-
dence of cV (τ ) which manifests in several diﬀerent ways.
The ﬁrst is that diﬀerent paths, particularly isochores,
have diﬀerent shapes from one another. The second is
that these curves do not coincide at the values of cV or
τ . Third, there is no ﬁxed inversion point. This is to
be contrasted to the main sequence curves seen in Fig-
ures 1-4 and 6, wherein all phase diagram paths share a
cross-system universal ﬁxed inversion point at the min-
imal value of about λd = 1 ˚A and cV = 2 (cV = 2 in
monatomic ﬂuids or appropriately modiﬁed cV in molec-
ular ﬂuids).

which path on the phase diagram is chosen: there is no
ﬁxed inversion point, and all curves are far away from
each other. This variation is removed once we plot cV vs
λd = cτ as seen in Figures 1-4 and 6.

Similarly to λd, τ is a dynamical parameter. However
the stark path dependence of cV (τ ) emphasises that the
c-transition is not a consequence of simply reducing cV
to dynamics, but that the introduction of the special new
dynamical parameter λd = cτ is necessary to achieve a
ﬁxed inversion point, data collapse and observe double
universality discussed in the next section.

We observe that although there is a moderate path
dependence of cV (λd) for lead in Figure 3, this path de-
pendence of cV (τ ) in Figure 7 is much more profound.
Hence in cases where the cV (λd) plot does not achieve
the full data collapse, it brings the paths signiﬁcantly
closer together.

C. Double universality

We now come to the main ﬁnding of this work related
to double universality of the c-transition. The ﬁrst uni-
versality is that for each system, the c-transition plot
has an inversion point which is ﬁxed and corresponds to
about λd = 1 ˚A and cV = 2 (cV = 2 for monatomic
systems or appropriately modiﬁed cV in molecular sys-
tems) for all paths on the phase diagram, including iso-
bars, isochores and isotherms, spanning orders of magni-
tude of temperature and pressure. This inversion point
provides an unambiguous, theory-independent and path-
independent, transition between liquidlike and gaslike
states in the sense discussed earlier. The second univer-
sality is that this behavior is generic on the supercritical
phase diagram and is the same for all ﬂuids simulated.

We now analyse our four systems (which excludes wa-
ter) on the same set of axes.
In order to compare,
we must remove the rotational degrees of freedom from
the heat capacity of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, which
amounts to subtracting 1 from cV as mentioned earlier.
This inter-system plot is presented in Fig. 8a.

The four ﬂuids exhibit qualitatively similar main se-
quence curves: the “c”-shape is present in all curves, and
the divergent liquidlike branches converge into almost the
same gaslike branch. This plot exhibits what we are call-
ing “double universality”: the function cV (λd) across not
only diﬀerent phase diagram paths but also across diﬀer-
ent ﬂuids converges at the universal inversion point of
cV ≈ 2, λd ≈ 1 ˚A. This inversion point therefore consti-
tutes a system independent, path independent, and un-
ambiguous model-free separation between liquidlike and
gaslike states in the supercritical state.

To draw the analogy with ordinary phase transitions,
we recall the behaviour of liquid and gas densities on the
coexistence line as the critical point is approached, de-
picted in Fig. 8b. The experimental relationship between
reduced density and reduced temperature of the coexist-

5

ing liquids and gases is system-independent for several
small noble and molecular elements near the critical point
[20]. In this plot, the speciﬁc microscopic details of dif-
ferent systems are often irrelevant to the qualitative be-
haviour near a phase transition, and the transition falls
into a universality class determined by system symme-
tries and dimensionality [21].

The plots in Fig. 8a depict the relationship between a
thermodynamic quantity, cV , and a dynamical quantity,
λd. It is in this sense that we consider the c-transition
to represent a dynamical-thermodynamic transition. The
system independence of the main sequence for simple ﬂu-
ids is further suggestive of a universal transition oper-
ating in the supercritical state. The ﬁxed point of this
dynamical-thermodynamic transition approximately cor-
responds to (λd = 1 ˚A, cV = 2).

We also note that the “c”-transition is not observed in
proximity to the critical point. The critical anomalies,
caused by diverging correlation lengths, present in this
region disrupt the relationship between the dynamical
length and the heat capacity in all systems studied here.
As mentioned earlier, the inversion point is far above the
critical.

Finally, the universal inversion point and the related
dynamical transition at the FL corresponds to the solu-
bility maxima (known as “ridges”) and optimal extract-
ing and dissolving abilities of supercritical ﬂuids [14].
This importantly addresses the widely-held belief that
improved and more eﬃcient deployment of supercritical
ﬂuids will beneﬁt from better theoretical understanding
of the supercritical state [2, 9, 10]. Our current results
therefore give a universal way to locate the inversion
point where the performance of a supercritical ﬂuid is
optimised, improving the supercritical technologies.

III. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the supercritical state has a re-
markable double universality. First, the transition be-
tween the liquidlike and gaslike states is characterised by
ﬁxed inversion point and near path-independence. Sec-
ond, this eﬀect universally applies to many supercritical
ﬂuids. This provides new understanding of the supercrit-
ical state of matter and a theoretical guide for improved
deployment of supercritical ﬂuids in green and environ-
mental applications.

For argon and nitrogen, we use the

nitrogen, we use a rigid two-site Lennard-Jones poten-

including the equation of state, high pressure and tem-
perature behaviour, and structure. The electrostatic in-
teractions were evaluated using the smooth particle mesh
Ewald method in the MD simulations of carbon dioxide
and water. The potentials for water and carbon dioxide
are rigid body potentials. Simulations of lead were per-
formed using an embedded atom model (EAM) potential
[28], which has been used to calculate the properties of
molten lead at temperatures up to 25000 K and 280 GPa,
which include the range discussed here.

Systems are simulated along several isobars, isotherms,
and isochores in the deep supercritical state, with all
paths but named exceptions being far from the critical
point and Widom line [3] of their respective phase dia-
grams. Equilibration was performed in the NPT ensem-
ble with the Langevin thermostat in order to generate
the mean densities along the isobars and isotherms. For
argon, system sizes between 500 and 108000 atoms were
used with no discrepancy in calculated quantities, consis-
tent with the earlier ascertained insensitivity of viscosity
to system size [29]. System sizes of 512 molecules were
used for water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide simulations,
and 5120 atoms for lead. The timestep used was 1 fs for
water and carbon dioxide and 0.5 fs for lead, which con-
served total energy under the Velocity-Verlet integrator
in the NVE ensemble to one part in 105. Conﬁgurations
at the target densities on all paths were then generated,
which were then equilibrated with the NVT ensemble
for 50 ps. Following this equilibration, we generated 20
independent initial conditions for each state point us-
ing seeded velocities, and each of these initial conditions
were run for 1 ns in the NVE ensemble during which all
properties were calculated. We calculated cV in the NVE
ensemble as [30]:

B. Theory: speciﬁc heat and dynamical length

In this section, we explain the physical origin of the
inter-relationship between the speciﬁc heat and the dy-
namical length in the supercritical state. The speciﬁc
heat, cV , is an obvious important choice of a thermody-
namic quantity because it reﬂects the degrees of freedom
in the system. The dynamical length and its role are
discussed below.

The choice of the dynamical parameter is informed by
the Maxwell-Frenkel viscoelastic theory [15, 34]. A liquid
has a combined response to shear stress:

where s is the shear strain, σ is the shear stress, η is the

stress relaxes according to:

Frenkel related this time to the average time between
molecular rearrangements. This relationship is backed up
by experiments and modelling [35, 36] and has become
an accepted view [37].

Using Eq. (4), the Navier-Stokes equation can be gen-
eralised to include the elastic response of the liquid, yield-

which sets the shortest wavevector for propagating trans-
verse phonons and corresponds to the gap in the phonon

Here, we work in terms of the “dynamical length” fea-

turing in Eq. (9), λd:

λd = cτ

(10)

λd sets the propagation range, or mean free path of
transverse phonons, in the liquidlike regime below the
FL [14]. This is seen from Eq. (8) which gives the decay
factor exp (cid:0)− t
(cid:1). Since τ sets the time over which the
shear stress decays in the liquid as discussed earlier or,
in other words, the lifetime of transverse phonons, cτ is a
measure of their mean free path. This implies no phonons
with wavelengths longer than the propagation range and
is consistent with Eq. (9).

FL [14], λd corresponds to the mean free path of particle
motion, lFP [15].
Indeed, the shear modulus in a ﬂuid
with no interactions is G∞ = nT [31], where n is the
concentration. Meanwhile, the gaslike viscosity is [39]
η = 1
3 ρvthlFP, where vth is the thermal velocity and lFP
is the particle mean free path. Noting that 1
2 nT ,
we ﬁnd τ = η
= lFP
. The dynamical length in the
vth
G∞
gaslike state is λd = cτ = vthτ (since the speed of sound
in the liquidlike state below the FL, c, approximately
becomes thermal velocity of particles in the gaslike state
above the FL, vth), and λd = lFP.

th = 3

2 ρv2

We can now see the role played by the dynamical length
in the liquidlike and gaslike regimes of the supercritical
state. kg in Eq. (9) increases with temperature because
τ decreases, and the dynamical length in (10) becomes
shorter. This reduces the phase space available for trans-
verse phonons [8]. When τ approaches its shortest value
comparable to the Debye vibration period τD, kg ap-
proaches the Brillouin zone boundary because cτD = a,
where a is the interatomic separation. At this point,
all transverse modes disappear, corresponding to cV = 2
(this value is equal to the kinetic term 3
2 and the potential
energy of the remaining longitudinal mode 1
2 [8]). On fur-
ther temperature increase, the system crosses over to the
gaslike regime where the phonon phase space continues
to reduce, albeit now for longitudinal phonons. In partic-
ular, the longitudinal phonons with wavelengths shorter
than lFP disappear because lFP sets the shortest wave-
length in the system. The associated potential energy of
the longitudinal phonons reduces, eventually resulting in
cv = 3
2 as in the ideal gas [8]. Since the phonon energy
contributes to liquid cV [4–8], we see that λd directly
aﬀects cV because it governs the phonon states in the
system.
