Abstract. Despite the remarkable development of parametric modeling methods for ar-
chitectural design, a significant problem still exists, which is the lack of knowledge and 
skill  regarding  the  professional  implementation  of  parametric  design  in  architectural 
modeling. Considering the numerous advantages of digital/parametric modeling in rapid 
prototyping and simulation most instructors encourage students to use digital modeling 
even from the early stages of design; however, an appropriate context to learn the basics 
of digital design thinking is rarely provided in architectural pedagogy. This  paper pre-
sents an educational tool, specifically an Augmented Reality (AR) intervention, to help 
students understand the fundamental concepts of parametric modeling before diving into 
complex parametric modeling platforms. The goal of the AR intervention is to illustrate 
geometric  transformation  and  the  associated  math  functions  so  that  students  learn  the 
mathematical  logic  behind  the  algorithmic  thinking of  parametric  modeling.  We  have 
developed BRICKxAR_T, an educational AR prototype, that intends to  help students 
learn geometric transformations in an immersive spatial AR environment. A LEGO set 
is used within the AR intervention as a physical manipulative to support physical inter-
action and improve spatial skill through body gesture.

Introduction 

The superficial knowledge that architectural students have in “digital design think-
ing” can cause them to adopt excessive trial-and-error approaches when using paramet-
ric modeling software, which leads to them not taking full advantages of what the soft-
ware has to offer [1]. Most students are exposed to parametric modeling software with-
out having the fundamental knowledge of computational design concepts including var-
iables (as the properties of the geometry), parameters (as the members of the function 
family),  and  functions  (as  the  math  operations).  Understanding  geometric  transfor-
mation  as  one  of  the  essential  components  in  parametric  modeling  and  learning  the 
associated  math  functions  would  allow  students  to  improve  their  knowledge  of  the

mathematical  logic  behind  digital  design  modeling  and  utilize  parametric  modeling 
software more efficiently and professionally [2]. However, studies have confirmed the 
difficulty of learning geometric transformations and the related math concepts through 
common  traditional  methods  [3][4].  Despite  the  close  relationship  between  spatial 
thinking and math problem solving, much of mathematics is still taught in a number 
sense - a collection of mathematical rules and procedures - in many educational sys-
tems, and geometry courses often focus on shape attributes rather than spatial reasoning 
[5]. Spatial methods can be useful for solving mathematical problems when diagrams, 
drawings, graphs and conceptualization are applicable  [5]. Based on APOS (Action-
Process-Objects-Schema) theory [6], students with only an action conception in math 
knowledge are more likely to use a trial-and-error technique to find function outputs 
instead of conducting an analysis and in-advance prediction to solve a problem. Such 
superficial techniques could cause architectural students to face difficulty in properly 
analyzing and understanding the logical algorithmic process behind sophisticated par-
ametric geometry modeling. Modeling software may not provide a competent context 
to educate the fundamentals, specifically due to the extraneous cognitive load that GUIs 
(Graphical User Interfaces) impose on learners [7]. On the other hand, physical model 
interaction has shown significant impact on spatial visualization and reduction of ex-
traneous cognitive load [8][9]. Hence, due to the close relationship between spatial rea-
soning and mathematics, physical interaction could affect learning math concepts pos-
itively.  
Augmented Reality (AR) as a mediator tool with the ability to superimpose abstract 
information over the physical environment provides a spatial intervention that  could 
support embodied learning and virtual augmentation. We have developed an AR edu-
cational prototype for teaching the fundamentals of parametric modeling including ge-
ometric  transformations  and  the  associated  math  functions  using  graphical  elements 
(e.g., arrows, tags, highlighting). The prototype, named as BRICKxAR_T is developed 
on top of the prior work - an AR instruction tool for LEGO assembly [10]. We have 
developed  BRICKxAR_T  as  a  Rotation/Translation/Scale  (RTS)  puzzle  game  for 
teaching geometric transformations and the associated math functions within the con-
structionist learning environment. A tangible LEGO model is employed as a physical 
manipulative to support physical interactions.

Background 

2.1 

Physical interaction in education 

In various areas of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts/Architecture, 
and Mathematics), the effect of physical models on cognitive learning and spatial abil-
ities has been explored. The studies suggest that physical activities increase the crea-
tivity of students in design ideation [8][11], reduce the extraneous cognitive load in the 
creative design process [12], promote students’ spatial skill in understanding scale re-
lations between geometries [13], and improve interaction and communication in a col-
laborative working environment [14]. Physical interaction supports embodied spatial 

3 

awareness and helps students in mental visualization skills [15]. Psychological studies 
argue that physical interaction facilitates the epistemic behavior of  students, enables 
them  to  form  embodied  abstract  metaphors  to  internalize  the  data,  and  helps  them 
strengthen  memory  retrieval  [16].  Multiple  research  projects  have  studied  the  ad-
vantage that physical models have over textbooks or computer-based 3D models [9][8], 
revealing the impact of physical model/interaction on spatial cognition and understand-
ing of complex spatial relations. The results of a study exploring the impact of Tangible 
User Interface (TUI) versus Graphical User Interface (GUI)  found that TUI provides 
more epistemic actions for designers, promotes spatial cognition, and stimulates design 
creativity, while GUI restricts designers to only following the design briefs and causes 
less exploration and discovery between design and solution spaces [8].  

2.2  Digital and parametric modeling in architectural education 

Digital modeling is an essential tool for effective design generation and design ex-
ploration. Digital modeling brings a new paradigm of design thinking named “digital 
design thinking.” Parametric design and its ability to generate multiple design alterna-
tives through anchoring design parameters is one of the most innovative achievements 
of digital modeling. However, during the digital design thinking process, students need 
to internalize an understanding of parametric design elements (variables, parameters, 
and math functions) and algorithmic analytical thinking in order to successfully take 
the full advantage of a parametric design process. Although the current visual program-
ming platforms in parametric modeling may not require in-depth knowledge of com-
puter language syntax, they urge for a proper understanding of input data (design vari-
ables), data structure, function components (parameters and equations), and output data 
for an efficient process and valid results. The importance of spatial transformations and 
their mathematics - linear algebra including vectors and matrices - for design profes-
sionals who wish to utilize and develop efficient computational techniques has been 
emphasized  clearly  in  “Essential  Mathematics  for  Computational  Design”  by  Rajaa 
Issa, 2010 [2], a textbook used widely in courses of parametric modeling and in learning 
of the modeling tools Rhino/Grasshopper. 

2.3  AR in education 

AR  applications  have  been  studied  in  many  educational  fields,  such  as  physics, 
mathematics, chemistry, and biomedical sciences, to enhance learning, especially in the 
situations where students cannot feasibly achieve real-world experiences [17][18]. In 
these experiments AR is used as an instrument to embody the interpretation of artifacts 
or abstractions in the physical world to ease the learning process. The intrinsic capabil-
ity of AR to automatically align the perspective view with the user's relative position 
provides a context for viewing the digital model from any arbitrary, natural perspective 
without mentally translating 2D to 3D [19]. Hence, the automatic natural perspective 
alignment could reduce the extraneous cognitive load that may impose through inter-
preting 3D models from 2D desktops. A couple of studies have investigated the appli-
cations of AR in learning geometry and related mathematics and demonstrated positive 

4 

impact of AR intervention in geometry perception [20]–[22]. The results of the study 
done by Dünser et al. (2006) showed insignificant, yet positive, impacts from AR in-
tervention on learning geometry and math [20]. Part of the reason for the insignificant 
impact might be due to user’s interaction with the digital model, which was realized 
through pencils and panels instead of direct interaction. GeoGebra AR [22] is another 
AR educational tool for learning geometry and algebra based on the widely used Geo-
Gebra application. GeoGebra AR has a limitation of anchoring virtual geometric mod-
els to only physical surfaces instead of arbitrary 3D physical objects (in contrast with 
BRICKxAR_T  that  enables  physical-virtual  model  registration,  tracking,  and  inter-
play). Studies show that AR can enhance teaching quality and contribute to architec-
tural design [23][24], improve the understanding of building science through immersive 
visualization of building information [25]–[27], advance the understanding of design 
sustainability  and  performance-based  design  [28]–[30],  and  encourage  collaboration 
and  engagement  among  Architecture/Engineering/Construction  (AEC)  students  [31] 
[26]. The overall results from studies in literature confirm that students’ learning effec-
tiveness  improves  when  the  related  information  is  situated  spatially  and  temporally 
close to the real-world experiment.  
Most studies in literature have investigated AR’s impact in the architectural industry, 
design ideation, collaboration, and communication. To the best of authors’ knowledge, 
no research has studied the educational impact of an AR intervention in improving the 
learning of geometric transformations and allied math concepts in order to enhance ar-
chitecture students' understanding of parametric and digital thinking. 

3  Methodology 

In this paper, we present an educational AR application to augment abstract, mathemat-
ical information found in geometric transformations into a physical environment. The 
prototype  is developed  to  support  three  levels  of  ‘motion, mapping  and  function’  in 
order to create a “network of learning path” for progressive learning of transformation 
conceptions [32]: 

•  Motions: AR supports physical actions (using LEGO model as a physical ma-
nipulative) to enable embodied learning through a spatial learning experiment. 
•  Mappings:  AR  supports  visualizing  the  transformation  mapping  process 
through demonstration of the transformation image (physical model) and pre-
images (virtual models) with input and output variables (points, lines and sur-
faces),  and  transformation  parameters  (rotation  axis,  distance,  and  angle) 
through displaying of arcs, lines, and notions. 

•  Functions: AR supports augmentation of mathematical functions of transfor-
mation matrices and their multiplications through spatiotemporal alignment of 
information and physical actions to enhance students understanding of geo-
metric transformations as mathematical functions.  

Figure 1 describes the framework of the developed prototype. The AR App is developed 
for iOS device  using the Unity game engine, Apple’s ARKit, C#  programming, and 

Xcode.  The last section of the framework, i.e. Deploying, is in the process and will be 
added in a future study.

Prototype 

We  have  developed  a  primary  prototype  for  an  RTS  (Rotation,  Translation,  and 
Scale)  puzzle  game  in  an  AR  environment.  The  prototype  is  presented  in  Research 
Symposium  2020,  College  of  Architecture,  Texas  A&M,  and  is  publicly  visible  at 
YouTube [33]. In this prototype, the three levels of geometric transformations, i.e. “mo-
tion,  mapping,  and  function,”  are  realized  by  visualizing  pre-images  and  images  of 
transformations in the AR environment and displaying the associated math functions 
that are dynamically aligned with transformations conducted in the integrated physical 
and AR environment. Graphical information such as dimension lines, rotation arcs, co-
ordinate  systems, and notations are displayed in the AR environment in real-time to 
assist users in visualizing math concepts and tracking the transformations matched with 
the users’ perspective in the physical environment. Two rows of matrices displayed in 
AR demonstrate the math functions associated with the geometric transformations con-
ducted in the physical and AR environment. The matrices are the common 4×4 trans-
formation matrices that could represent all types of linear transformations such as rota-
tion, translation, scale, reflection, and shear [5], as well as perspective transformation. 
Figure 2 shows the transformation matrices used in this prototype, including translation, 
rotation, and scale. The blue highlighted region of the 4×4 transformation matrix (col-
umn  1-3  and row  1-3)  would  be  filled by  any of  the  3×3 matrices  of  rotation/scale, 
while the translation vector will fill the orange region (column 4 and row 1-3). The 
result of the combination of transformations will be conducted through matrix multi-
plication accordingly. 

 
6 

Fig. 2. Transformation matrices 

In BRICKxAR_T, the first row of matrices shows a transformation matrix and associ-
ated mathematical functions (i.e.  linear algebraic  operation of  matrix multiplication) 
applied on the physical model in the physical environment in real-time. The second row 
corresponds to the transformations of the digital model in the AR environment. In the 
beginning, both matrices are identity matrices, while a digital wireframe model superi  
mposes the physical LEGO model using marker registration (Figure 3. Left). When the 
user starts to play with the physical model and apply actions on the model, for example, 
move or rotate the model, the wireframe model stays in the primary position represent-
ing  the  pre-image  of  the  transformation. The  tracking  graphics  (i.e.,  dimension  line, 
rotation arc, and notations) appear to represent the mapping relation between the pre-
image (wireframe model) and the image (physical model). At the same time, the user 
can observe the mathematical functions of the applied transformations where numbers 
match the notations displayed on dimension line and rotation arc (Figure 3. Right) for 
developing an intuitive understanding of the transformations. This approach generates 
a meaningful context for abstract mathematical functions aligned with the studies that 
reveal the benefits of contextualization in presenting mathematics content [34][35].

Later, students can apply transformations on the virtual model for matching the trans-
formations of the physical model through interacting with the members of the function

family using sliders: for example, touching x, y, and z of the translation vector or tap-
ping the transformation logo to apply rotation and scale through modifying the values 
of the selected parameters. Figure 4 shows the parameters corresponding to the trans-
lation operation. The colors of the translation vector parameters match with the associ-
ated coordinate system to visually help students in matching the math information to 
the action.  

Fig. 4. Interacting with parameters of the matrix function to transform the virtual model. 

To apply other transformations, i.e., rotation and scale, students can tap on the trans-
formation logo displayed on the screen. Each time the logo is tapped, the associated 
transformation matrix and the corresponding slider to change  the  selected parameter 
(i.e., rotation angle or scale factor) appear on the screen. For rotation, the corresponding 
rotation axis and plane are graphically highlighted as well as the color of the logo that 
get matched with the corresponding rotation axis. These graphical representations in-
tend to catch students’ visual attention. Figure 5 shows the graphical information and 
associated  matrices  for  rotation  around  x-  and  y-axis,  and  Figure  6  shows  the  same 
information for rotation around z-axis and 3D scale. The three coordinate systems in 
the figures belong to the physical model (image), the original position of the model 
(pre-image) and the digital model respectively. The last two coordinates are overlapped 
in figures 5 to 7.

In addition, the spatial mapping concept can be visualized using a set of representative 
points on the pre-image and their corresponding mapped points on the image (Figure 
7).  

Fig. 7. Visualize mapping operation between pre-image and image using mapped points on the 
models or in the space. 

In this phase, the students can play with multiple parameters such as translation axes 
(x, y, and z), rotation axes (x, y, and z), and the scale factor, and trace the associated 
math matrices corresponding to the wireframe model, i.e., the second row of matrices 
in green color. The task assigned to this part is to practice the AR registration (physical 
and virtual model alignment) method that is normally done automatically by the AR 
technology using the camera and motion sensors on the AR device. Students need to 
modify function parameters to implement the correct transformations so that the two 
models (virtual and physical) align again. In order to exactly match the two models, 
students need to compose the transformation matrix of the virtual model (second row) 
so it matches with the transformation matrix of the physical model (first row) in the 
transformed position. The original position of the LEGO model (the primary pre-image) 

 
 
 
 
 
is displayed with a world coordinate system in this prototype where the model is regis-
tered in the beginning. Figure 8 shows from a third-person view a student playing with 
BRICKxAR_T using an iPad with AR enabled.

Discussion: 

The  AR-enabled  RTS  prototypes  intend  to  support  architecture  students  learning 
parametric modeling, specifically geometric transformations and allied, essential math-
ematical concepts [3]. During the RTS tasks, spatial relations help students intuitively 
understand the math concepts behind geometric transformations. Some examples of the 
relations between spatial reasoning and math in the RTS tasks are described as follows: 
•  The spatial rotation in different directions (clockwise or counterclockwise) is 
associated with and displayed through the - and + signs in math. The arc graph-
ically visualizes the rotation quantity with the corresponding degree notation.  

 
 
 
 
 
10 

•  The measuring line graphically demonstrates the distance between the images 
of the transformations (pre-image and image). The distance notation also nu-
merically matches with the physical distance. For example, when the distance 
is doubled, the measuring line and the distance notation demonstrate a doubled 
value.  

•  The transformation matrices numerically match with the graphical infor-

mation of the transformation dynamically displayed through lines and arcs. 
The linear algebraic equations corresponding to matrix multiplication also 
numerically match with the graphical information of the corresponding trans-
formations. 

We  expect  that  providing  a  spatial  context  for  mathematical  information  associated 
with geometric transformations will positively help students in spatial cognition asso-
ciated with geometric transformations and mathematics. We hope that such spatial con-
textualization help students understand math subjects such as matrices as an integrated 
procedure with spatial motions rather than solely numbers and equations. This positive 
effect may be most pronounced in students with medium and low spatial skills because 
this intervention may help them in constructing visual imagery of transformation ma-
trices that could lead to understanding the math concepts more effectively in an intuitive 
way. Ultimately, we anticipate that this intervention may boost students’ understanding 
of parametric modeling methods and use of the software tools accordingly.

Conclusion and Future work 

In  this  paper,  we  have  presented  an  AR  educational  prototype,  named 
BRICKxAR_T, to improve learning fundamentals of parametric modeling. The goal of 
the BRICKxAR_T is to assist students in learning geometric transformations and their 
associated math functions as one of the essential components of parametric modeling. 
In this paper, we broke down the geometric transformation process into three levels of 
‘motion, mapping, and function’ to help students understand the mathematical func-
tions behind transformation actions. The AR educational prototype is designed to help 
students learn about digital modeling components named as variables, parameters, and 
functions through a transformation puzzle game.  We believe that learning the funda-
mentals of parametric modeling and understanding the mathematical reasoning behind 
“digital design thinking” in an intuitive way may positively impact students in the pro-
fessional use of parametric modeling methods for architectural design. We are going to 
evaluate the impact of BRICKxAR_T on students’ spatial and math skill learning in 
future studies upon approved IRB (number: IRB2020-1213M). We are going to hold 
workshops conduct user studies to compare experimental and control groups, using AR 
and non-AR learning methods, respectively. We expect that contextualizing math func-
tions in a spatial and physical scenario and visualizing the related information and no-
tations may help students improve their understanding of geometric transformations as 
mappings and functions rather than motions. Also, we believe that BRICKxAR_T may 
reduce  the  mental  load  in  learning  geometric  transformations  and  increase  students’ 
motivation in learning the targeted subject. In future studies, we are going to conduct 

11 

multiple tests and surveys, including Purdue Visualization of Rotations Test [36], math 
tests on transformation matrices, NASA_TLX survey [37], and motivation surveys [38] 
to assess our claims.
