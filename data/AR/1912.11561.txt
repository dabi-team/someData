ABSTRACT
Close detached binaries were theoretically predicted to evolve into contact by three
subtypes of case A binary evolution: case AD, AR, and AS, which correspond to the
formation of contact during dynamic-, thermal-, and nuclear-timescale mass transfer
phase, respectively. It is unclear, however, what is the diﬀerence between contact
binaries in these subtypes, and whether all of these subtypes can account for the
formation of observed W UMa binaries. Using Eggleton’s stellar evolution code with
the nonconservative assumption, I obtained the low-mass contact binaries produced
by case AD, AR, and AS at the moment of contact, and their parameter spaces. The
results support that the progenitors of low-mass contact binaries are detached binaries
with orbital periods shorter than ∼ 2 − 5 d, and their borderlines depend strongly on
the primary mass. In addition, the period-colour relations for case AR and AS can be
in better agreement with that for observed W UMa candidates, but case AD shows a
signiﬁcantly worse agreement. Moreover, case AR and AS can produce a short-period
limit (corresponding to a low-mass limit) at almost any age, e.g. from young age
(∼ 0.2 Gyr) to old age (∼ 13 Gyr), agreeing with observed W UMa binaries in star
clusters, but no such limit occurs for case AD at any age. These results support that
case AR and AS, as opposed to case AD, can lead to W UMa binaries (including young
W UMa binaries).

1 INTRODUCTION

Low-mass contact binaries have a peanut shape where
two stars ﬁll their respective Roche lobes. Low-mass con-
tact binaries are important in understanding the forma-
tion and evolution of close binaries, because they con-
tain the least amounts of angular momentum among all
binaries without compact components (black holes, neu-
tron stars, or white dwarfs). Mass and energy can be
transferred between two stars in low-mass contact bina-
ries (Li, Han & Zhang 2004a,b; Yakut & Eggleton 2005;
Jiang et al. 2009; Kouzuma 2018), and therefore they at-
tract special attention as laboratories to study these physi-
cal processes in close binaries. Low-mass contact binaries are
the progenitors of the only stellar merger (V1309 Sco) ob-
served before (Tylenda et al. 2011), which make them an
important source to understand binary merger (Webbink
1976; Hut 1980; Jiang et al. 2010; St¸epie´n 2011). As an im-

portant part of blue straggler population (Rucinski 1998,
2000), low-mass contact binaries contain the information
on the dominant formation mechanism of blue stragglers,
because low-mass contact binaries were observed in both
blue-straggler sequences in globular clusters (Ferraro et al.
2009; Dalessandro et al. 2013), which suggests that binary
evolution can contribute to both blue-straggler sequences
(Jiang et al. 2017). Moreover, the absolute magnitudes of
low-mass contact binaries are related to their orbital pe-
riods and colours,
implying that they can be used as a
distance tracer to investigate Galaxy structure (Rucinski
1994; Chen, de Grijs & Deng 2016; Mateo & Rucinski 2017;
Chen et al. 2018).

The most well-known observable counterpart of low-
mass contact binary is W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type
eclipsing binary. Their deﬁning feature is the sinusoidal-
like light curve with equal-depth minima. This suggests
that two components have similar temperatures, although
they may have very diﬀerent masses revealed by spectro-
scopic observation. W UMa binaries are the most numerous

eclipsing binaries, and have been detected in any properly
observed stellar system, for example, the ﬁeld, open clus-
ters (e.g. Rucinski 1998; Sriram, Kiron & Vivekananda Rao
2009; Luo 2015; Chen et al. 2016), globular clusters (e.g.
Rucinski 2000; Li et al. 2017). Tens of thousands of can-
didates have been discovered from surveys, e.g. All Sky Au-
tomated Survey (Pojmanski, Pilecki & Szczygiel 2005), the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (Rucinski 1996),
Super Wide Angle Search for Planets (Norton et al. 2011),
Kepler space mission (Prˇsa et al. 2011; Slawson et al. 2011)
, and Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (Drake et al.
2014a,b, 2017). Their spatial frequency relative to FGK type
main-sequence stars is ∼ 0.2% in the solar neighborhood es-
tablished from the Hipparcos and ASAS samples (Rucinski
2002, 2006), while their frequency was found to be very
high in open clusters (Rucinski 1994) and globular clusters
(Rucinski 2000). Recently, Chen et al. (2018) had compiled
a catalog of 55,603 contact binary candidates, and found
that their luminosity function may be diﬀerent in diﬀerent
environments of the Galaxy.

(2003);

The origin of W UMa binaries is one of the most
fundamental questions, because detailed knowledge of their
origin is required by many unsolved problems in the inves-
tigation of W UMa binaries, such as their over-luminosity
of the secondaries (Lucy 1968), their short-period limit
(Rucinski 1992; St¸epie´n 2006; Jiang et al. 2012), and
their
structure and evolution (K¨ahler 2002a,b, 2004;
Li, Han & Zhang 2004a,b, 2005). At present, the detached-
binary channel is one of the popular formation channels.
Various studies and discussions have been emerged since
1960s, e.g. Huang (1966); Roxburgh (1966); Webbink
(1976); van’t Veer (1979); Vilhu (1982); St¸epie´n (1995);
Webbink
Tutukov, Dryomova and Svechnikov
(2004); Jiang, Han & Li (2014). In this channel, a close
binary may evolve into semi-detached phase by evolutionary
expansion of the components (Webbink 1977a) and angular
momentum loss (Vilhu 1982), and subsequently evolves
into contact when the accretor star ﬁlls its Roche lobe
in response to mass transfer. Another main formation
mechanism of W UMa binaries is ﬁssion process, which
can produce a W UMa binary directly at the end of
the pre-main-sequence contraction (Roxburgh 1966), and
therefore can explain young (<0.5 Gyr) W UMa binaries
(Bilir et al. 2005). However, it is still unclear which is the
dominant formation mechanism of young W UMa binaries,
because the detached-binary channel can also produce such
young W UMa binaries (Jiang, Han & Li 2014).

In the detached-binary channel, the progenitors of W
UMa binaries (sometimes referred to as ”precontact bina-
ries”) are usually detached or semidetached binaries with
EA- or EB-type light curves (unequal eclipse depths). They
may be chromospherically very active and may exhibit even
the ﬂares. Many close binaries have been observed with
the determination of fundamental stellar parameters (e.g.
Yakut & Eggleton 2005; Matson et al. 2017), and stellar ac-
tivities have also been detected in many close binaries (e.g.
Balona 2015; Gao et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Luo et al.
2019). Some close binaries were observed as progenitors of
W UMa binaries (e.g. Ka lu˙zny 1990; Maceroni & Rucinski
1999; Samec et al. 2013). At present, many observational
studies mainly focused on detached binaries with periods
shorter than 1d as the progenitors of W UMa binaries. How-

ever, theoretical predictions suggested that the progenitors
of W UMa binaries may have an upper-period limit much
longer than 1 d, e.g. ∼ 2 − 4 d (Vilhu 1982; St¸epie´n 2011;
Jiang, Han & Li 2014). In addition, the mass ratio may be
another important parameter to determine whether or not a
detached binary is the progenitors of W UMa binaries, but
the mass-ratio range of the progenitors still remains unclear.
It should be noted that even after low-mass close bina-
ries evolve into contact, there is a long-standing challenge
of how these contact binaries evolve. Lucy (1976) and Flan-
nery (1976) predicted that contact binaries undergo ther-
mal relaxation oscillations (TRO) about a state of marginal
contact (see also Webbink 1976, 1977a,b; Sarna & Fedorova
1989; Yakut & Eggleton 2005). Each oscillation includes a
contact phase and a semi-detached (non-contact) phase, and
this periodic evolution process is driven by mass and energy
transfer between two components. In the contact phase, en-
ergy transfer is from the massive component to the less mas-
sive component, which leads to mass transfer in the oppo-
site direction. Mass transfer from the less massive compo-
nent to the more massive component will drive the evolution
from contact to semi-detached phase. In the semi-detached
phase, the more massive components transfer mass to the
less massive component, driving the system back into a con-
tact phase. This model can successfully explain observed
properties of W UMa binaries, e.g. the observed light curves.
Previous studies (Eggleton 2000; Nelson & Eggleton
2001; Eggleton 2006) indicated that three evolutionary
routes of case A binary evolution can bring low-mass de-
tached binaries into contact with two main-sequence com-
ponents. They evolve into contact during the dynamical-
timescale mass transfer phase (dynamic RLOF, case AD),
during the thermal-timescale mass transfer phase (rapid to
contact, case AR), or during the nuclear-timescale mass
transfer phase (slow to contact, case AS), respectively.
Nelson & Eggleton (2001) presented the initial parameter
spaces of these subtypes with conservative assumption of to-
tal mass and orbital angular momentum, but they suggested
that the nonconservative assumption is needed to be inves-
tigated because the conservative theoretical models were a
worse agreement with the observed cool Algols. Moreover,
diﬀerent evolutionary routes of pre-contact phase may prob-
ably produce a contact binary with diﬀerent nature. For ex-
ample, Nelson & Eggleton (2001) suggested that case AR
may produce a W UMa type binaries, while case AD is likely
to lead to a binary merger after a short-timescale phase
(contact or common envelope phase). Based on this sug-
gestion, Jiang et al. (2012) proposed dynamic mass transfer
instability to explain the short-period limit of W UMa bi-
naries. However, additional evidence is needed to support
this suggestion about the relations between W UMa bina-
ries and three subtypes of case AD, AR, and AS. Many fac-
tors are also still poorly known for three subtypes with the
nonconservative assumption, such as their initial parameter
space and their timescales of pre-contact phase. Therefore,
more detailed work with the nonconservative assumption
also needs to fully investigate these three subtypes.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the formation
of low-mass contact binaries from detached binaries through
case AD, AS, and AR with the nonconservative assumption,
and to investigate their possible connections with W UMa
binaries. The outline of this paper is as follows. The binary

the binary evolutionary results are presented. The discussion
and conclusions are given in Sect. 4 and Sect. 5.

2 BINARY EVOLUTION CALCULATIONS

To determine whether a detached binary can evolve into
contact when two components are still MS stars,
it is
necessary to perform detailed binary evolution calculations.
Eggleton’s stellar evolution code (Programme EV, private
communication 2003)1 is employed in this paper. This
code was originally developed by Eggleton (1971, 1972,
1973), which have been updated over the last four decades
(Han, Podsiadlowski & Eggleton 1994; Pols et al. 1995;
Nelson & Eggleton
2001; Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton
2002; Yakut & Eggleton 2005; Eldridge, Izzard & Tout
2008). This version of code includes the models of the non-
conservative eﬀects, e.g. dynamo-driven mass loss, magnetic
braking, and tidal friction to the evolution of stars with
cool convective envelopes (Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton
2002; Yakut & Eggleton 2005; Eggleton 2006, 2010).

In this version of the EV code, there are two diﬀer-
ent modes for calculating the evolution of binaries: normal
(non-TWIN) mode and TWIN mode. In the normal mode,
the stellar equations for the mass donor (the primary) are
ﬁrst solved, and its mass-transfer history is stored. Then,
this history is used as input for a subsequent calculation
of the evolution of the mass gainer (the secondary). This
mode has been used to compute Case A binary evolution
with conservative assumption (Nelson & Eggleton 2001). In
the TWIN mode developed by P. P. Eggleton in April 2002,
the stellar equations of both stars in a binary are solved si-
multaneously. Therefore, this mode can be used to model
heat transfer between two stars (Yakut & Eggleton 2005)
and non-conservative mass transfer in massive close binaries
(de Mink, Pols & Hilditch 2007). To study three subtypes
of case AD, AR, and AS with the nonconservative assump-
tion, the TWIN mode is used in this work to solve both
stars simultaneously. This is because the orbit of the pri-
mary will be varying due to the nonconservative eﬀects on
the secondary, if both stars are subject to the nonconser-
vative eﬀects of dynamo-driven mass loss, magnetic brak-
ing, and tidal friction (Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton 2002;
Yakut & Eggleton 2005; Eggleton 2006, 2010).

The calculation of mass-transfer rate between two stars
in the TWIN mode is also diﬀerent from that in the normal
mode. In the normal mode, the mass-transfer rate for one
star ﬁlling its Roche lobe is only treated as a function of its
stellar radius and its Roche lobe radius (Nelson & Eggleton
2001). However, an alternative way of computing mass-
transfer rate is needed when both stars are solved simul-
taneously. Therefore, mass-transfer rate between two stars
in the TWIN mode is treated as a function of the surface
potentials and the Roche surface potentials for both stars.
The direction of mass transfer depends on the potential dif-
ference between stellar surfaces of two stars, and the mass-
transfer rate is computed by the integral of a function of the

potential diﬀerence between the surface of each layer and
the Roche-lobe surface for all layers outside the Roche lobe
(more details see de Mink, Pols & Hilditch 2007).

The evolutionary tracks were calculated with diﬀerent
initial primary masses M10, mass ratio q0 = M10/M20 > 1,
and orbital periods P0 at the metallicity of Z = 0.02.These
initial parameters are at equal logarithmic intervals,

log M10 = −0.35, −0.3, ..., 0.6,

log(q0) = 0.05, 0.10, ..., 1.0,

log(P0/PZAMS) = 0.05, 0.10, ...,

where PZAMS is an approximation of the orbital period
where the primary ﬁlls its Roche lobe on zero-age main se-
quence for a system with equal masses (Nelson & Eggleton
2001). The range of the primary masses is chosen from 0.45
to 4 M⊙ to focus on the formation of low-mass contact bi-
naries. Many low-mass binaries with primary mass <0.9 M⊙
may reach RLOF with the nonconservative assumption, al-
though they can not reach RLOF in 20 Gyr with conservative
assumption (Nelson & Eggleton 2001). The upper limits of
the initial orbital period are chosen to cover case AD, AR,
and AS binary evolution for diﬀerent primary mass.

In the calculations of these binaries, both stars in a
binary start to evolve simultaneously from zero-age main
sequence. When the main-sequence primary ﬁlls its Roche
lobe (classiﬁed as case A), its matter will be transferred to
the secondary. If the mass transfer of a binary accelerates to
ÛM > M/tdyn), this bi-
the dynamic timescale rapidly (e.g.
nary would be expected to experience dynamic RLOF and
is classiﬁed as case AD in this work, following the classiﬁ-
cation of Eggleton (2000) and Nelson & Eggleton (2001). A
binary is classiﬁed as case AR (rapid evolution to contact)
when the secondary ﬁlls rapidly its Roche lobe as a result of
mass accretion during thermal-timescale (tKH) mass trans-
fer phase (AR, M/tdyn > ÛM > M/tKH). If a binary evolves
into contact not during the thermal-timescale mass trans-
fer phase, but during the following nuclear-timescale mass
transfer phase ( ÛM < M/tKH), it is classiﬁed as case AS (slow
evolution to contact).

In this paper, the mass-transfer rates and thermal
timescales of the binaries are determined in the calculation
of binary evolution, and their dynamic timescales are as-
sumed to be less than one-tenth of the thermal timescale
given by Nelson & Eggleton (2001). To compare with the
results given by Nelson & Eggleton (2001), these binaries
are calculated to evolve to 20 Gyr unless the code experi-
ences convergence problems, thus making the evolutionary
calculations stop. The evolutionary calculation of a binary
also stops at the moment when it is classiﬁed as case AD,
AR, or AS, because this paper only focused on the formation
of contact binaries, not their evolution.

3 BINARY EVOLUTION RESULTS

3.1 The initial parameter spaces of case AD, AR,

and AS

The initial parameter space is important for investigating
case AD, AR, and AS, but is still poorly known. In Fig. 1, the
initial parameters were mapped in the orbital period-mass
ratio plane (for a range of primary masses), which lead to a
contact binary through case AD, AR, and AS. It can be seen
that contact binaries from these three subtypes have diﬀer-
ent initial parameter spaces and the initial primary mass
has a strong inﬂuence on the initial parameter spaces of
case AD, AR, and AS. With the decrease of primary mass,
the parameter space of case AD becomes larger. In contrast,
the parameter spaces of case AR and AS become smaller,
and disappear ﬁnally, although the upper limits of the pe-
riod for case AR and AS increases from P0 = 2 d at 3.98 M⊙

to P0 = 5 d at 1.0 M⊙. For the same primary mass, case AD
occurs in the binaries with larger q0, while case AR and AS
occur in the binaries with smaller q0. This initial parameters
space can be used to estimate the outcome of a detached bi-
nary, or to ﬁnd the progenitors of contact binaries for case
AD, AR, and AS. If the parameters of a detached binary are
located in these regions, a low-mass contact binary is then
expected to be produced by case AD, AR, or AS in future.

has played a critical role in the testing of models of W
UMa systems ever since (Li, Han & Zhang 2004a,b). Based
on a recent catalog of W UMa binaries candidates compiled
by Chen et al. (2018), the possible connections were inves-
tigated between W UMa binaries and three subtypes (case
AD, AR, and AS). Figure 2 shows these observed candidates
of W UMa binaries and the low-mass contact binaries from
case AD, AR, and AS in the plane of log(P −Teﬀ). The eﬀec-
tive temperatures of these observed candidates were taken
by cross-matching with the A, F, G, and K type star catalog
from the LAMOST DR5 data (Cui et al. 2012; Deng et al.
2012; Luo et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2012) using a 2′′angular
radius. Traditional contact binary models assumed energy
transfer between two stars to explain their nearly equal tem-
peratures. Following Jiang, Han & Li (2014), the eﬀective
temperatures of low-mass contact binaries produced by case
AD, AR, and AS can be corrected for this energy transfer
according to T 4 = (R2
2T 4
2), where R1, R2, T1,
and T2 are the radii and the eﬀective temperatures of the
primary and the secondary at the moment that the binary
systems evolve into contact.

As shown in Fig. 2, the low-mass contact binaries with
longer orbital period have higher temperature in case AD,
AR, and AS, which is in agreement with the observed trend
of W UMa binaries candidates. However, there is a disagree-
ment between case AD and the observed W UMa candidates.
Case AD can not cover the observed W UMa candidates with
logP < −0.5, and case AD has much higher temperature than
observed systems with the same orbital period. Case AD also
shows a clearly ﬂat distribution for logP > −0.5, which is also
not consistent with observed distribution. Case AR and AS
are in much better agreement with the observed sample than
case AD. They cover the observed W UMa candidates with
logP < −0.5, and are much closer to the observed sample
for logP > −0.5. Therefore, the period-eﬀective temperature
(or colour) relations for case AR and AS can be in better
agreement with that for observed W UMa candidates, but
case AD shows a signiﬁcantly worse agreement.

3.2.2 The short-period limits and the pre-contact
timescales for case AD, AR, and AS

The short-period limit (also corresponding to a low-mass
limit) is one of the most important characteristics of W
UMa binaries (Rucinski 1992), which can further constrain
the possible connections between three subtypes and W
UMa binaries. Figure 3 shows the mass of the more mas-
sive component, the total mass, and the orbital period of
low-mass contact binaries when they evolve into contact
through case AD, AR, and AS, and the age presents the pre-
contact timescales (the timescales from a detached-binary
formation to contact). As shown in this ﬁgure, all three
subtypes can produce low-mass contact binaries in a wide
range of age from 0.1 Gyr to 15 Gyr , and this agrees with
the previous suggestion that the formation of contact bina-
ries from detached binaries occur at any age (Li et al. 2007;
Jiang, Han & Li 2014). However, their distributions of the
mass of the more massive component and the total mass
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent as shown in the upper and middle
panels of Fig. 3. Case AR and AS show the existence of a low-
mass limit (the dashed lines in Fig. 3), while case AD does
not show such a low-mass limit. These low-mass limits exist
in case AR and AS at almost any age, although they decrease
with age. These low-mass limits were compared with the
observed W UMa sample with well-determined parameters
compiled by Yıldız & Do˘gan (2013) from Yakut & Eggleton
(2005); Gazeas et al. (2005, 2006); Zo la et al. (2005, 2010).
The minimum values of the observed W UMa sample are
0.56 M⊙ and 0.76 M⊙ for the primary mass and total mass,
respectively. These values seem to agree with the low-mass
limits for case AR and AS, although there is no information
about the age of these observed W UMa samples.

It should be noted that star clusters can oﬀer informa-
tion on the age of W UMa sample observed in star clusters,
because the age of observed W UMa sample is the same as
the cluster age. Bukowiecki et al. (2012) collected W UMa
binaries observed in star clusters and listed their orbital pe-
riods and ages, and their sample can be used to investi-
gate the possible connections between three subtypes and

with low-mass contact binaries produced by case AD, AR,
and AS in lower panels of Fig. 3. It can be seen that case AR

a short-period limit at any age, similar to a low-mass limit
as shown in the upper and middle panels of Fig. 3, while
there is no such a short-period limit for case AD at any age.
The most interesting result is that observed W UMa sam-
ples in clusters also show a short-period limit at a diﬀerent
age, agreeing with that predicted by case AR and AS. The
existence of a short-period limit of W UMa binaries at a
diﬀerent age provides another strong evidence that case AR
and AS, as opposed to case AD, can lead to W UMa binaries
(including very young W UMa binaries).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison with the models of
Nelson & Eggleton (2001)

Nelson & Eggleton (2001) constructed the data cubes with

diﬀerent metallicities, and diﬀerent assumptions about mass
loss and angular moment loss for Z = 0.02. They presented
the conservative data cube at Z = 0.02 with primary masses
0.8-50 M⊙ and showed the initial-parameter region of eight
subtypes of case A evolution in this data cube. This work
only focused on three subtypes (case AD, AR, and AS) for
the low-mass binaries (primary masses between 0.45 and
4 M⊙) with the nonconservative assumption that both mass
loss and angular momentum loss from the system. Compar-
ison with their contours with conservative assumption, the
main diﬀerence is that the ranges of initial orbital period of
case AD, AR, and AS in this work are much larger than that
in their contours, because the nonconservative assumption
that mass and angular momentum loss can shrink the orbits
of detached binaries with longer initial orbital period, mak-
ing them evolve into contact. For the primary mass of 1 M⊙ ,
as an example, detached binaries with P0 < 0.5 d can evolve

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2015)

into contact through case AD, AR, or AS with conservative
assumption, while those with P0 < 5.5 d can evolve into con-
tact through case AD, AR, or AS with the nonconservative
assumption. In addition, the contours in this paper include
the binary system with much less primary mass, and show
that case AD may be the only subtype where detached bi-
naries evolve into contact, which agrees with the suggestion
given by Jiang et al. (2012).

4.2 Comparison with the models of
Yakut & Eggleton (2005)

Yakut & Eggleton (2005) investigated the evolution of close
binaries with conservative and non-conservative assump-
tions. They pointed out that the boundary between cases
AR and AS depends not just on initial mass ratio and ini-
tial orbital period, but also on the initial mass of the pri-
mary. This agrees with the results in this paper, which show
the initial primary mass has a strong inﬂuence on the ini-
tial parameter spaces of case AD, AR, and AS as shown
in Fig 1. They also suggested that the nonconservative ef-
fects may reduce the range of case AS, but increase that of
case AR. The initial-parameter spaces of cases AD, AR, and
AS shown in this paper also agrees with their suggestion.
In their non-conservative evolutionary models, both com-
ponents were solved simultaneously, and this paper adopted
the same way (the TWIN mode of the EV code) to calculate
the evolution of binaries with the non-conservative assump-
tion. Therefore, the code used in this paper can show the
same evolutionary tracks of binary in the log R vs. M plane
as that of the binary shown in their Fig. 5(a). The main dif-
ference between their paper and this paper is that this paper
considered the binaries with the primaries less massive than
0.8 M⊙, and focused on comparing low-mass contact binaries
produced by case AD, AR, and AS.

or due to thermal instability when the primary attempts to
cross the Hertzsprung gap (Webbink 1976). Therefore, case
AD, AR, and AS may be progenitors of poorly understood
stellar merger, blue stragglers, and FK Com stars.

4.4 The origin of W UMa binaries

The origin of W UMa binaries is still a matter of debate, and
they can be originated during pre-main sequence phase (e.g.
ﬁssion process, Roxburgh 1966; Bilir et al. 2005), or dur-
ing main-sequence phase (e.g. the detached-binary channel,
Vilhu 1982; Bradstreet & Guinan 1994; Jiang, Han & Li
2014). Their ages have been used to distinguish two chan-
nels. For example, W UMa found in old (∼ 10 Gyr) and
intermediate-age (∼ 5 Gyr) clusters support the detached-
binary channel, because their ages are much larger than
their contact lifetime. However, it is diﬃcult to distinguish
the origin of young (∼ 0.5 Gyr) W UMa binaries based on
their age, because young W UMa binaries can be produced
by both channels (Roxburgh 1966; Bilir et al. 2005; Vilhu
1982; Jiang, Han & Li 2014). The results in this paper show
that case AR and AS can produce a short-period limit (cor-
responding to a lower mass limit) at almost any age, agreeing
with the observation that the short-period limit of W UMa
binaries exist in a diﬀerent age (from ∼ 0.3 Gyr to ∼ 10 Gyr)
cluster, even including young (∼ 0.3 − 1 Gyr) clusters. There-
fore, the short-period limit may be another important prop-
erty to distinguish the origin of W UMa binaries, although
it is still unclear whether ﬁssion process can also explain the
existence of the short-period limit of W UMa binaries at
young age.

4.3 Connections between W UMa binaries and

case AD, AR, and AS

4.5 The progenitors of W UMa binaries

Although case AD, AR, and AS can lead detached binaries
to contact when both components are still main-sequence
stars, it is still unclear what are their consequences, and
whether they can produce W UMa binaries (observational
counterparts of low-mass contact binaries). This work has
investigated the possible connections between W UMa bina-
ries and case AD, AR, and AS. The results in this paper show
that low-mass contact binaries produced by case AR and AS
have a reasonable agreement with observed W UMa bina-
ries in the orbital period-eﬀective temperature diagram and
the age-mass(or orbital period) diagram, while the agree-
ment is much poorer for case AD. This helps to support
the suggestion that case AD will lead to a merger of two
components on a quite short timescale through a common-
envelope phase, while case AR and AS may lead to a rela-
tively long-lived contact situation observed as W UMa bi-
naries (Nelson & Eggleton 2001; Eggleton 2010; Jiang et al.
2012). However, it should be noted that W UMa binaries are
also expected to ultimately coalesce into single stars due to
Darwin instability when the spin angular momentum of the
system is more than a third of its orbital angular momentum
(Hut 1980; Rasio 1995; Li & Zhang 2006; Jiang et al. 2010),

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2015)

The typical progenitors of the detached-binary channel are
close binaries with initial orbital periods shorter than a cer-
tain critical value, e.g. the upper-period limit (Vilhu 1982;
St¸epie´n 2011; Jiang, Han & Li 2014). Identiﬁcation of these
progenitors would be used to study and support this chan-
nel. The results in this paper show that the mass ratio also
has an important inﬂuence on identifying potential progen-
itors of W UMa binaries. Only the binaries with small mass
ratio (i.e., equal masses) will experience case AR or AS evo-
lution to form a W UMa binary, for example, V506 Oph
(q = M1/M2 ∼ 1.01, Torres et al. 2019). Even if some bina-
ries with large mass ratio (i.e., unequal masses) have a pe-
riod shorter than the upper-period limit, they will fail to pro-
duce a long-lived W UMa binaries due to case AD evolution,
e.g. WY Cnc (P ∼ 0.83, q ∼ 2.61, Heckert et al. 1998; Chen
2013), CSTAR 036162 (P ∼ 0.87d, q ∼ 2.82, Liu et al. 2018).
However, they may be the best candidates of the common-
envelope merger, and can also be used to constrain adiabatic
mass-loss models in binaries (Ge et al. 2010). Therefore, the
parameter spaces of case AD, AR, and AS can be expedi-
ently used to distinguish the progenitors of W UMa binaries
or the common-envelope merger.

4.6 The following evolution of low-mass contact

binaries

At present, this work studied only the formation of low-mass
contact binaries from case AS and AR. Their following evo-
lution and structure are still far from full understanding.
The most diﬃcult problem is the process of energy transfer
between two components, which roughly equalizes the sur-
face temperatures of two stars with diﬀerent masses. This
process has been supported by total observational luminos-
ity of W UMa binaries equal to their total nuclear lumi-
nosity (Mochnacki 1981; Webbink 2003; Jiang et al. 2009).
Some physical model for this energy-transfer process has
been developed (K¨ahler 2002a,b, 2004; Li, Han & Zhang
2004a,b, 2005; Yakut & Eggleton 2005). Diﬀerential rota-
tion observed in the Sun has been suggested to be a new
mechanism for the energy transfer between two compo-
nents (Yakut & Eggleton 2005; Eggleton 2010). The energy-
transfer rate is found to be related to the luminosity ratio
or mass ratio (Csizmadia & Klagyivik 2004; Li et al. 2008;
Jiang et al. 2009), and has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the struc-
ture and evolution of contact binaries (Li, Han & Zhang
2004a; Jiang et al. 2009). However, it is not considered that
low-mass contact binaries may be originated diﬀerently by
case AR or AS at present, and it is unclear whether low-
mass contact binaries produced by case AR and AS have
same energy-transfer mechanism, or same energy-transfer
rate. More theoretical work is obviously needed to investi-
gate the following evolution of low-mass contact formed from
case AR and AS with considering energy-transfer process.

5 CONCLUSIONS

By performing detailed binary evolution calculations for low-
mass close binaries with the nonconservative assumption,
three subtypes (AR, AS, and AD) of binary evolution chan-
nels were investigated, which may lead to contact while both
components are still main-sequence stars. The results in this
paper showed that the initial-parameter spaces of three sub-
types strongly depend on the initial mass of the primary.
Both the low-mass contact and their progenitors show a low-
mass limit for case AR and AS, but not for case AD. The
distributions of these low-mass contact binaries in period-
eﬀective temperature and the age-mass (or period) diagrams
support the view that case AR and AS may form a W UMa
binary, while case AD may lead to a binary-merger event
through a rapid, unstable contact phase (or called ” a com-
mon envelope phase”), instead of a stable contact binary.
In future investigations, the structure and evolution of low-
mass contact binaries produced by case AR and AS will be
studied, which will help us to understand W UMa systems.
The properties of case AD can also be used to ﬁnd the ob-
served candidate of the common-envelope merger.
