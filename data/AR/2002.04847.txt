Abstract

The aim of the NA61/SHINE strong interaction programme is to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting
matter. The main physics goals are the study of the onset of deconﬁnement and the search for the critical point of strongly
interacting matter. These goals are pursued by performing a beam momentum (13A – 150/158A GeV/c) and system size
(p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) scan. This contribution presents new results from NA61/SHINE on
ﬂuctuations and correlations which include in particular quantum correlations, as well as multiplicity and net-charge
ﬂuctuations, proton density ﬂuctuations and anisotropic collective ﬂow. Obtained results are compared with other
experiments and with model predictions.

Keywords: critical point, onset of deconﬁnement, ﬂuctuations, intermitency, femtoscopy, ﬂow

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE [1, 2] at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is a ﬁxed-target experiment pursuing

a rich physics program including measurements for strong interactions, neutrino, and cosmic ray physics.

The strong interactions program focuses on search for the critical point (CP) and study of the onset
of deconﬁnement (OD) of strongly interacting matter. NA61/SHINE is the ﬁrst experiment to perform a
two-dimensional scan, in beam momentum (13A – 150/158A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be,
Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) of colliding nuclei.

2. Search for the critical point

The expected signal of a critical point is a non-monotonic dependence of various ﬂuctuation/correlation
measures in such a scan. A speciﬁc property of the CP - the increase in the correlation length - makes ﬂuctu-
ations its basic signal. Special interest is devoted to ﬂuctuations of conserved charges (electric, strangeness
or baryon number) [3, 4].

In order to compare ﬂuctuations in systems of diﬀerent sizes one should use intensive quantities, i.e.
quantities insensitive to system volume. Such quantities are constructed by division of cumulants κi of the
measured distribution (up to fourth order), where i is the order of the cumulant. For second, third and fourth
order cumulants intensive quantities are deﬁned as: κ2/κ1, κ3/κ2 and κ4/κ2.

Figure 1 shows the system size dependence of third and fourth order cumulant ratio of net-electric
charge at 150/158A GeV/c. Measured data are in agreement with EPOS 1.99 model [5, 6] predictions. More
detailed examination of system size dependence of the same quantities for negatively and positively charged
hadrons (Fig. 2) shows very diﬀerent system size dependence. Moreover, none of the measured quantities
of h+ and h− are reproduced by the EPOS 1.99 model. This disagreement indicates that we do not fully
understand the underling physics how ﬂuctuations are induced. Thus, more detailed studies are needed.

In search of CP a possible tool is proton intermittency which should follow power-law ﬂuctuations near
CP. It can be checked by studying the scaling behaviour of 2nd factorial moments F2(M) with the cell size
or, equivalently, with the number of cells in (px,py) space of protons at mid-rapidity (see Refs. [7, 8, 9]).
For experimental data a non-critical background must be subtracted with mixed events. After subtraction,
the second factorial moments ∆F2(M) should scale according to power-law for M >> 1 with resulting
critical exponent φ2 comparable to theoretical predictions [10]. Figure 3 shows ∆F2(M) in semi-central
Ar+Sc interactions at 150A GeV/c. The diﬀerence between left and right side of the ﬁgure is the considered
statistics. Left hand side shows results released in 2018 [11]. These results indicate positive values of ∆F2
which may be connected with the CP. Right hand side shows the same results but with higher statistics (208k

events vs 143k events) where ∆F2 signal is weaker.

At the CP, the spatial correlation function becomes a power-law ∼ r−(d−2+η), where d represents the
number of dimensions. One can predict a critical exponent η (related to spatial correlations) for the QCD
universality class, which is the 3D-Ising model for QCD [12, 13]. The predicted value of η at the CP is
0.03631 [14]. For the random ﬁeld 3D Ising η = 0.50 ± 0.05 [15]. In the HBT analysis the momentum
correlation function C(q) of produced particles is directly related to the normalized source distribution S (r)
via C(q) = 1 + (| ˜S |)2, where ˜S is the Fourier transformation of S (r). The data analysis was done by using a
Levy distributed source function [16]. Since, it leads to the same power-law tails, the Levy exponent α was
assumed to be identical to the spatial correlation exponent η [17]. In the vicinity of the critical point, very
low α values (around 0.5) may be expected and this can be measured by investigating the Bose-Einstein
correlation function C(q) = 1 + λe−(qR)α. Figure 4 (left) shows measured values of α parameter for pion pairs
(π−π−, π+π+ and π−π− + π+π+) in 20% most central Be+Be collisions at 150A GeV/c.

All measured combinations indicate 1 < α < 2 which is far from the CP value. In addition to the CP,
α values lower then 2 can be caused by anomalous diﬀusion, QCD fractal structured jet fragmentation, and
also to some extend by the averaging over broad event class (e.g. centrality) [18, 19, 20, 21].

3. Bulk matter properties

Spatial asymmetry of the initial energy density in the overlaping region of the colliding relativistic nuclei
is converted, via interactions between produced particles, to the asymmetry of momentum distribution of

particles in the ﬁnal state. The resulting asymmetry encodes important information about the transport prop-
erties of the QCD matter created during the collision. Asymmetry is usually quantiﬁed with the coeﬃcients
vn in a Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles relative to the reaction
plane. The NA61/SHINE has an unique way to estimate the reaction plane with the Projectile Spectator
Detector (for details see Refs. [22, 23]).

The energy dependency of ﬂow coeﬃcients is of particular importance. At the SPS energies it is expected
that the slope of proton directed ﬂow at mid-rapidity, dv1/dy, changes its sign [24, 25, 26]. Directed ﬂow of
π− for Pb+Pb collisions at diﬀerent energies is presented in Fig. 4 (right). The NA49 results [22] for 40A
GeV/c were obtained using spectator plane estimated with Veto calorimeter (VCAL). Directed ﬂow of π−,
in particular the pT dependence where v1 changes its sign, shows collision energy dependence.

4. Summary

Numerous experimental results show no indications of the CP in Be+Be collisions at 150A GeV/c. En-
larged statistics of Ar+Sc interactions has not improved the signiﬁcance of the proton intermitency signal,
making it inconclusive. In order to qualitatively measure the CP signal, the background phenomena should
be studied in details. Measured system size dependences of multiplicity ﬂuctuations show clear disagree-
ment with model predictions.

The measured directed ﬂow of pions shows energy dependence, with the slope of negatively charged

pions changing sign at diﬀerent collision centralities in Pb+Pb collisions (for details see Ref. [23]).
