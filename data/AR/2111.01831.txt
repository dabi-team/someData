Photocatalytic water splitting has greatly stimulated as an ideal technique for producing hy-
drogen (H2) fuel by employing two renewable sources, i.e., water and solar energy. Here, we have
adopted a facile hydrothermal approach for the successful synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
incorporated Fe/MgO nanocomposites followed by thermal treatment at inert atmosphere to inves-
tigate their ability for photodegradation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting.
Transmission Electron Microscopy images of Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposite ensured the distribution
of Fe/MgO nanoparticles throughout rGO sheets. Notably, all rGO supported nanocomposites, espe-
cially the one, thermally treated at 500 ◦C at Argon (Ar) atmosphere has demonstrated signiﬁcantly
higher photocatalytic eﬃciency towards the photodegradation of a toxic textile dye, rhodamine B,
than pristine MgO and commercially available Degussa P25 titania nanoparticles as well as other
composites. Under solar irradiation, Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite exhibited 86% degradation
of rhodamine B dye and generated almost four times higher H2 via photocatalytic water splitting
compared to commercially available P25 titania nanoparticles. This promising photocatalytic ability
of the Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite can be attributed to the improved morphological and sur-
face features due to heat treatment at inert atmosphere as well as escalated charge carrier separation
with increased light absorption capacity imputed to rGO incorporation.

INTRODUCTION

With the industrial revolution and an increase in
the world population, the consistent growth in energy
consumption, coupled with high pollution levels, has
sparked tremendous research interest in alternative and
renewable energy fuels [1–4]. Solar energy is consid-
ered as a potential alternative energy source due to its
abundance and sustainability. The eﬃcient conversion
of solar energy into chemical fuel is the ultimate chal-
lenge in confronting the energy crisis of today’s world.
Nowadays, the production of H2 through photocatalytic
water splitting [5, 6] using solar energy is gaining sin-
cere attention in the scientiﬁc community because they
are simple, eﬃcient and have signiﬁcant potential for
future development [7–10]. Owing to its low cost and
environmentally friendly nature, hydrogen has emerged
as the most feasible substitute for traditional fossil fuels
as a green and eﬃcient energy source with high stor-
age capacity [11–15]. Though at present, renewable
energy contributes only ∼5% of commercial hydrogen
production mainly through water electrolysis [16], the
remaining ∼95% hydrogen is primarily generated from
fossil fuels [17] which is neither cost-eﬀective nor eco-
friendly. Therefore, the development of eﬃcient and
cost-eﬀective photocatalysts using renewable sources re-

mains challenging. On the other hand, photodegra-
dation using photocatalysts for environmental reme-
diation has been recognized as an eﬀective approach
for converting hazardous industrial contaminants into
non-toxic byproducts [18–20]. In this context, several
quantiﬁed photocatalysts, including TiO2, ZnO, CdS,
SrTiO3, CdS/TiO2/Pt, and TiO2/Ag2O, have been
widely used [21–26]. Unfortunately, these existing pho-
tocatalysts suﬀer from limitations such as large band
gap and quick recombination of e– - h+ pairs, limiting
their photocatalytic performance and solar energy uti-
lization eﬃciency.

Magnesium oxide (MgO) with high surface reac-
tivity, extensive absorption capacity, and ease of pro-
duction has been used recently for various applications,
including catalysis, ceramics, waste-water remediation,
anti-bacterial agents, and so on [27–29]. However, due
to its large band gap energy and fast charge carrier
recombination, bare MgO has negligibly lower photo-
catalytic performance [30]. These issues were resolved
by adding low concentrations of transition metal ions
at the conducting MgO interface, which prevents the
formation of recombination centers for photo-generated
e– - h+ pairs [31]. Among transition metal ions, iron
(Fe) has a high transition ability and can trap mul-
tiple types of electron-hole pairs [32–34]. Thus incor-
porating Fe on MgO may improve the separation of
the maximum number of electrons and holes, thereby
avoiding recombination [35]. In recent years, graphene,

tured sp2 -hybridized carbon atoms, has sparked sig-
niﬁcant research interest in various energy adaptation
applications as well as in the ﬁeld of photocatalysis [36–
38]. The importance of graphene is attributed to its ex-
cellent charge carrier mobility, electrical conductivity,
high speciﬁc surface area and superior chemical stabil-
ity [39, 40]. Graphene has two oxidative derivatives,
between which reduced graphene oxide (rGO) demon-
strates enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to
graphene oxide (GO) when they are being tailored as
supporting material to make a composite with pho-
tocatalysts [41, 42]. The oxygen components over a
pure GO surface may give a reverse action against its
high electron conductivity, turning GO into an insula-
tor [43, 44]. Several attempts have been adopted to
synthesize pure graphene by reducing oxygen epoxy;
among them, thermal treatment at inert atmosphere
has been considered to be quite promising for produc-
ing high strength reduced graphene oxide by eliminating
oxygen-containing functional groups from the surface of
GO [45]. Besides, thermal treatments may signiﬁcantly
modify the properties of photocatalysts since they have
a notable impact on the physicochemical characteristics
of the respective materials [46, 47].

Motivated by manifestations mentioned above, in
this investigation, a simple hydrothermal route has been
adopted for the synthesis of rGO supported Fe/MgO
nanocomposites followed by heat treatment at diﬀer-
ent temperatures at Argon (Ar) atmosphere. Several
extensive studies have been carried out to synthesize
nanoscale MgO powders using diﬀerent synthesis tech-
niques, such as solid state, sol-gel, chemical precipi-
tation method, etc [48–50]. Among various methods,
the hydrothermal technique is regarded as one of the
most successful approaches to obtain the desired struc-
tures with high phase purity and uniform size distri-
bution with an additional advantage of being low cost
for
[51]. According to our acknowledgement, here,
the ﬁrst time, we report the application of hydrother-
mally synthesized Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposite photo-
catalysts on wastewater remediation and generation of
H2 through water splitting. Furthermore, the inﬂuence
of heat treatment on the structure, morphology as well
as the catalytic properties of Fe/MgO-rGO nanocom-
posites has also been explored. The photocatalytic per-
formance of widely used Degussa titania (P25) nanopar-
ticles has also been studied under similar experimental
conditions for comparative analysis.
It has been ob-
served that Fe/MgO-rGO after heat treatment at 500
◦C at Ar atmosphere demonstrated higher potential in
H2 production via solar driven water splitting compared
to other synthesized nanocomposites and P25 nanopar-
ticles. In most of the previous investigations [52, 53],
the photocatalytic performance of rGO based compos-
ites have been observed to be improved either by ad-
dition of H2O2 doses in dye and photocatalyst mix-

ture, or by enhancing the power of light irradiation
and controlling the pH of the solution, etc. However,
in this investigation, Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocompos-
ite has demonstrated satisfactory performance in RhB
degradation and H2 evolution without using any ad-
ditional reagents or external energy input and in neu-
tral pH condition. We anticipate that this unique prop-
erty might distinguish our synthesized composite from
those reported by others. Finally, a plausible reaction
mechanism for the profound photocatalytic activities of
Fe/MgO-rGO(500) has been suggested.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Materials

The chemical reagents used were analytical grade
Manganese nitrate hexahydrate [Mg(NO3)3.6H2O],
Ferric nitrate nonahydrate [Fe(NO3)3.9H2O], Graphite
ﬂakes, Sodium nitrate [NaNO3], Sodium hydroxide
[NaOH], Potassium permanganate [KMnO4], Sulfuric
acid [H2SO4], Hydrochloric acid [HCl] and Hydrogen
peroxide [H2O2]. All the reagents were manufactured
by Sigma-Aldrich, Germany.

B. Sample preparation

1. Synthesis of Fe/MgO nanocomposites

Fe/MgO nanocomposites were synthesized by adopt-
ing a facile and low-cost hydrothermal technique [51].
The ﬁrst step was the synthesis of MgO nanoparticles,
for which 1 mmol Mg(NO3)3.6H2O were dissolved in 50
ml of 5M NaOH solution and magnetically stirred for
about 4 hours to form a homogeneous mixture. The
solution was then transferred into a Teﬂon-lined au-
toclave and heated at 180 ◦C for 12 hours. The sus-
pension was allowed to cool down to room temperature
naturally. Afterwards, the ﬁnal products were washed
several times with deionized water and ethanol followed
by centrifugation, and dried in the oven for 10 hours at
100 ◦C. In the next step for incorporating Fe on MgO
nanoparticles, 1 mmol Mg(NO3)3.6H2O and 0.03 mmol
Fe(NO3)3.9H2O were dissolved in 50 ml of 5M NaOH
solution and the rest of the procedure was similar to
that described earlier. After the hydrothermal process,
both MgO and Fe/MgO were treated at various temper-
atures at Ar atmosphere for further characterization.

2. Synthesis of Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposites

Initially, 1 mmol Mg(NO3)3.6H2O and 0.03 mmol
Fe(NO3)3.9H2O were dissolved in 50 ml of 5M NaOH
solution and stirred for 4 hours to get suspension I.
In the next step, graphite oxide, prepared by modiﬁed
Hummer’s method [54], was sonicated for 2 hours in DI
water to obtain graphene oxide (GO). Then 10 mg of
GO was dispersed in 10 ml DI water to make suspen-
sion II . The suspension I and II were combined and
stirred for an additional 1 hour. The mixture was then
transferred into a Teﬂon-lined autoclave and heated at
180 ◦C for 12 hours. The hydrothermally synthesized
products were washed and dried, and we have obtained
the ﬁnal composites after heat treatment of the dried
products at 400 and 500 ◦C at Ar atmosphere. A
schematic representation of the synthesis process has
been depicted in Fig. 1.

tailed analysis of the experimentally acquired XRD data
using FullProf Suite Software [51]. The surface mor-
phology were investigated from ﬁeld emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) imaging along with the
energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis using a scan-
ning electron microscope (XL30SFEG; Philips, Nether-
lands) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Talos F200X; Thermo ﬁsher scientiﬁc, USA) at an
operating voltage of 200 kV. With an aim to observe
the optical properties, the absorption spectra of the
as-synthesized samples were investigated in the range
of 200–600 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer
(UV-2600; Shimadzu, Japan). Steady-state photolumi-
nescence (PL) analysis was carried out using a Spec-
tro Fluorophotometer (RF-6000; Shimadzu, Japan) to
study the rate of photoinduced electron-hole recombi-
nation during the photocatalytic process [2].

C. Characterization techniques

The Crystalline structure and phase purity of the
samples were characterized by the powder X-ray diﬀrac-
tion (XRD) spectra using a diﬀractometer (PANalyti-
cal Empyrean, UK; Cu-Kα,λ = 1.5418 Å). Additionally,
the Rietveld reﬁnement approach was conducted for de-

The photocatalytic performance of the synthesized
nanocomposites was assessed by monitoring the degra-
dation of rhodamine B (RhB) dye in DI (deionized)
water solution without the presence of any sacriﬁcial
agents. A 500W Xe lamp (Hamamatsu Photonics,
Japan) having irradiance value of 100 mW cm-2 was

This can be attributed to the absence of any chemically
reducing agent during hydrothermal preparation.

The Rietveld reﬁnement method was used for
detailed structural analysis of the samples after heat
treatment at Ar atmosphere. Fig.
2(a), (b), (c),
and (d) display the Rietveld reﬁned powder XRD
patterns of synthesized materials after heat treatment
at Ar atmosphere. MgO and Fe/MgO nanoparticles
heated at 500 ◦C are represented by MgO(500) and
Fe/MgO(500),
and Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposites
heated at 400, and 500 ◦C are represented by Fe/MgO-
rGO(400) and Fe/MgO-rGO(500), respectively.
It
is conﬁrmed that following the heat treatment at
500 ◦C at Ar atmosphere, the synthesized hexagonal
structured Mg(OH)2 was converted into cubic MgO
which is consistent with a previous investigation [56].

used as a solar simulator [11]. For each trial, 80 mg
of photocatalyst powder was dissolved in 15 mg/L of
RhB solution. Prior to irradiation, the solution was
magnetically stirred in the dark for 60 minutes to at-
tain an adsorption equilibrium of RhB on the surface
of the photocatalysts. After the lamp was turned on,
4 ml of the solutions were extracted at 1 hour inter-
vals and centrifuged to ﬁlter out the catalyst particles.
The absorbance of the solution at a speciﬁc wavelength
was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer to in-
vestigate the changes in RhB concentration caused by
solar irradiation. The photodegradation process was re-
peated four times under identical experimental proce-
dures to check the stability and reusability of the pho-
tocatalysts.

E. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiment was
conducted in a slurry type reactor, where 20 mg of pho-
tocatalyst were mixed with 30 ml DI water and kept
under magnetic stirring before being illuminated by a
500W Hg-Xe lamp. Meanwhile, the system was purged
with argon gas for 30 minutes to ensure an inert atmo-
sphere for the splitting process. The evolved hydrogen
(H2) was extracted at one-hour intervals under illumi-
nation, then analyzed and quantiﬁed using the GC (Shi-
madzu, Japan) device equipped with the thermal con-
ductance detector (TCD) and gas analyzer. The GC
programming was reverse polarized in order to attain
hydrogen peaks in the upward direction to allow a com-
parative analysis with the peak intensities of the various
gases produced [11].

mosphere

Moreover, it can be observed that all samples display

characteristics diﬀraction peaks

indexed at

(200), (220), (311) and (222) planes which are in good
accordance with cubic MgO with Fm-3m space group
(JCPDS card no. 1-75-447 [57]). Fig. 2(a) and (b)
show that due to the incorporation of Fe in MgO(500)
nanoparticles, the peak positions remained the same,
which suggested that Fe did not alter MgO crystal
structure and was suitably deposited on the surfaces of
MgO [35]. Though the presence of an additional iron
oxide phase α-Fe2O3 was observed in Fe/MgO(500)
samples (Fig. 2(b)) due to iron substitution, which was
eliminated when GO was added into the sample and
heated at inert atmosphere as shown in Fig. 2(c) [31].

Comparing the XRD patterns of ESI Fig.
S1(c) and Fig. 2(c), the formation of Fe/MgO-rGO
is assured at 400 ◦C temperature with an absence of
GO peak indicating the total reduction of GO. This
is consistent with the reduction mechanism of GO by
thermal deoxygenation, in which an increase in tem-
perature facilitates the removal of oxygen-containing
functional groups from GO [58, 59]. This also explains
the disappearance of α-Fe2O3 phase due to GO substi-
tution. With the increased temperature at Ar atmo-
sphere, slightly decreased peak broadening as well as
an increase in peak intensities was observed (Fig. 2(c)
and (d)). This decreasing trend of peak broadening in-
dicates the increase in particle size, suggesting agglom-
eration at a higher temperature [60, 61].

Table 1 presents diﬀerent structural parameters
along with constituent phases for as-synthesized sam-
ples. Notably, the calculated lattice parameters are
well consistent with the values reported in the litera-
ture [62]. The lattice parameters and volume corre-
sponding to the MgO phase remain almost unaltered
throughout the synthesis process, which conﬁrmed that
the crystal structure was not distorted. The reﬁned and
observed XRD patterns for the cubic MgO phase are in
reasonable agreement according to the ﬁtting parame-
ters (Rwp, Rp, RExp and χ2) and atomic coordinates
(ESI Table S1).

2. Surface morphology

The FESEM image in Fig. 3(a) demonstrates ran-
domly aggregated, thin, crumpled sheets like structure
of GO [55]. In Fe/Mg(OH)2-GO samples, without heat
treatment (ESI Fig. S2(a)), numerous Fe/Mg(OH)2
hexagons with diﬀerent particle sizes were predomi-
nately observed to be grown and randomly distributed
on the GO surface. Fig. 3(b), (c), and (d) represent
the FESEM images of Fe/MgO sample heated at 500
◦C and Fe/MgO-rGO samples heated at 400 and 500
◦C at Ar atmosphere, respectively. It can be seen that
for Fe/MgO-rGO(400) sample, the surface are not ho-
mogeneous, and the particles growth is not up to the

5

mark, which can be ascribed to the fact that hexago-
nal Fe/Mg(OH)2 did not completely transformed into
cubic Fe/MgO at lower heating temperature (400 ◦C).
However, due to graphene incorporation, a large num-
ber of Fe/MgO nanocrystallites nucleate and grow into
ﬁne seed particles at the early stage of hydrothermal
treatment; with time, this is followed by the growth
of Fe/MgO nuclei [63, 64]. Surprisingly, when compos-
ites are formed with rGO, such consumption of ﬁner
seed particles that lead to the growth of nuclei is inter-
rupted due to steric blockage of seed particle transporta-
tion caused by the interpenetrating graphene networks
[65]. However, for Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposite at 500
◦C temperature, the particle size distribution seems to
be more homogeneous than the samples treated at 400
◦C. For a further increase in temperature to 600 ◦C,
resulted in a signiﬁcant amount of agglomeration [66],
as can be observed in ESI Fig. S2(b). This result im-
plies that 500 ◦C is the optimized Ar atmosphere re-
quired to form Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposites with a
higher degree of uniformity in shape and size. To get
further insight into the morphology of the rGO sup-
ported Fe/MgO nanocomposite at 500 ◦C, TEM imag-
ing was performed at various magniﬁcations (Fig. 4).
The TEM image, Fig. 4(a) clearly demonstrated the
distribution of Fe/MgO nanoparticles on rGO sheets.
The higher magniﬁcation images, Fig. 4(b) and (c) con-
ﬁrmed the presence of graphene sheets.
In Fig. 4(d)
we have observed bright concentric rings in the selected
area electron diﬀraction (SAED) pattern, which implied
the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized nanocom-
posite.

3. Elemental composition

The compositions of the synthesized samples were
identiﬁed utilizing EDX analysis. The experimental de-
tails in ESI Fig. S3 show that the desired elements C,
Mg, O and Fe are present in the synthesized samples,
and no additional element was found. The EDX spectra
were taken at three distinct positions, and the average
atomic ratios of Mg, Fe, O and C were observed to be
very close to nominal composition within the instru-
mental accuracy.

B. Optical characterization

1. Optical band gap

The optical properties of all the synthesized samples
were studied using UV-visible diﬀuse reﬂectance spec-
troscopy (DRS) in the wavelength range of 200–600
nm. Fig. 5(a) demonstrates the room temperature

UV-visible absorption spectra of pure MgO, Fe/MgO
nanoparticles and Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposites after
heat treatment at diﬀerent reaction temperatures. All
the samples exhibited continuous absorption across the
UV region, at the same time, the addition of rGO
showed an increase in the optical absorption compared
to pure MgO and Fe/MgO samples, indicating higher
light absorption ability of the synthesized nanocompos-
ites. Moreover, MgO nanoparticles exhibit a prominent
absorption peak at 286 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(a). In
contrast all Fe-incorporated samples show a blue shift

in the absorption peak, which can be attributed to the
formation of donor energy levels in the actual band gap
of MgO.

The optical band gap Eg of the samples were cal-

culated using Tauc’s relation [11]

where hν, A and Eg denote the energy of the photon,
proportionality constant and optical band gap, respec-
tively and F(R) is a parameter calculated from DRS

Figure 4. TEM images (a-c), and SAED pattern (d) of Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite

by Kubelka–Munk function [51]. From Fig. 5(b), the
band gap energy was determined by extrapolating the
straight-line portion to the abscissa at zero absorption
co-eﬃcient. The band gap of MgO is found to be 3.9 eV
which has been reduced to 3.3 eV when Fe was incorpo-
rated into MgO. Incorporation of rGO suppressed the
crystal growth, resulting in smaller particle size and the
band gap energy of Fe/MgO-rGO(400) nanocomposite
was reduced to 2.78 eV [55]. As the temperature rises
from 400 to 500 ◦C, there is an increase in band gap
from 2.78 to 3.0 eV due to quantum conﬁnement eﬀect
[67]. Another reason is that extremely high tempera-
ture promotes the generation of strong bonds between
the crystallites, leading to the agglomeration of particles
[68]. Interatomic bonds are tightened and high energy
is required to break a bond, and move an electron to
the conduction band.

2. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra at steady-state

A photocatalyst must possess the ability to inhibit
the electron-hole pair recombination eﬃciently. To
study this property, we have conducted the PL analysis
of our samples for an excitation wavelength of 200 nm as
represented in ESI Fig. S4. The optical band gaps from
the position of the PL peaks are observed to be 3.40,
2.69 and 3.03 eV for Fe/MgO(500), Fe/MgO-rGO(400)
and Fe/MgO-rGO(500) samples, respectively. These
values are in accordance with the band gaps obtained
from UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 5(b)). Notably, the
peak intensity of both rGO supported samples are lower
than Fe/MgO samples, which suggests that the separa-
tion of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can be facil-
itated through rGO incorporation. This result is also
consistent with our previous band gap estimation by
DRS, where the band gaps of all rGO assisted nanocom-
posites are smaller than those of Fe/MgO.

Moreover, for Fe/MgO-rGO(500), the peak in-
tensity is lowest as compared to other samples, which
imply the successful separation and transfer of photo-
generated charge carriers. As a result, the photocat-
alytic activity of this nanocomposite under solar irradi-
ation increases by inhibiting electron-hole pair recom-
bination [69]. The outcome of our experiment is also in
good agreement with previous reports, where PL emis-
sion is observed to be quenched due to rGO substitution
[70, 71]

C. Photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B
(RhB) dye

To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the as-
synthesized materials, at ﬁrst, a blank test was con-
ducted without any catalyst. RhB did not show sig-
niﬁcant degradation for four hours indicating the self-
degradation ability of RhB is extremely low. After that,
the catalyst samples were blended with RhB solution
and kept in the dark under constant magnetic stirring
in order to achieve adsorption equilibrium. In Fig. 6(a)
and (b), we have presented the time-dependent UV-
visible absorbance spectra of RhB at one-hour inter-
vals in the presence of Fe/MgO-rGO(400) and Fe/MgO-
rGO(500) photocatalysts. The decrease in absorbance
peak as irradiation time extends, indicates the decom-
position of RhB under solar irradiation.
It was ob-
served that incorporation of rGO, and heat treatment
has resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement in degrada-
tion eﬃciency of the nanocomposites and the maximum
degradation of RhB was observed at 500 ◦C at Ar at-

mosphere. This result may be attributed to the rela-
tionship between the stability of the crystal structure
and the eﬀectiveness of reduced graphene oxide for so-
lar light absorption [68].

The degradation eﬃciency as well as degradation

rate were calculated by using the following equation

Photocatalytic degradation(%) =

C0 – C
C0

× 100 (2)

Fig.
6(c) demonstrates the degradation characteris-
tics of RhB as a function of solar irradiation time
in the presence of as-synthesized MgO, Fe/MgO(500),
Fe/MgO-rGO(400) and Fe/MgO-rGO(500) photocata-
lysts as well as commercially available Degussa TiO2
(P25) nanoparticles for comparison. C0 and C repre-
sent the primary and retained concentrations of RhB in
the solution, respectively. The degradation eﬃciency
of pure MgO, Fe/MgO(500), Fe/MgO-rGO(400) and
Fe/MgO-rGO (500) was ∼25% , ∼42%, ∼80% and
∼86%, respectively. The photodegradation curve of
commercial titania (P25) was also plotted in Fig. 6(c)
for comparison. Interestingly, the degradation percent-
age of all the samples except MgO is higher compared
to P25. The large band gap and quick charge carrier
recombination might be responsible for this poor degra-
dation eﬃciency of MgO. Due to the presence of Fe on
MgO, the band gap was reduced, the active surface of
MgO was increased, and the RhB dye degradation ef-
ﬁciency was enhanced accordingly [33, 34]. Moreover,
for comparison we have also evaluated the photodegra-
dation ability of Fe2O3, Fe2O3-MgO, and Fe2O3-rGO
samples for comparison. It was observed that under four
hours of solar irradiation, the degradation eﬃciency was

∼38%, ∼43%, and ∼52% for the respective samples,
which was signiﬁcantly lower than that of Fe/MgO-rGO
nanocomposites. The synthesis procedure of the above-
mentioned samples and the experimental ﬁndings of the

photodegradation experiments have been attached in
the supplementary (ESI Fig. S5). From these obser-
vations, it can be elucidated that the inclusion of rGO
in Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposite signiﬁcantly improved

10

their photocatalytic performance. The highest photo-
catalytic degradation eﬃciency of ∼86% was observed
for Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposite, which was heated at
500 ◦C at Ar atmosphere. We think that at optimum
temperature of 500 ◦C maximum number of oxides were
removed from GO and resulted in the successful mi-
gration of electrons from the conduction band (CB) of
Fe/MgO to rGO [72]. This migration inhibited electron-
hole pair recombination and resulted in an outstand-
ing photocatalytic performance of Fe/MgO-rGO(500)
nanocomposite [73]. In addition, from the FTIR anal-
ysis of Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite we can ob-
serve peaks at 1450 and 3390 cm-1, indexed to –OH and
H–O–H vibration bonds, respectively (ESI Fig. S6).
These oxygen-containing groups have an eﬀective role
in the photocatalytic activity of catalysts by generating
more hydroxyl radicals to facilitate the photocatalytic
process [72, 74].

We have incorporated the Pseudo ﬁrst-order
kinetics model to quantitatively study the kinetics
of the photocatalytic degradation using the following
equation[6]:

ln(C0/C) = kt

(3)

6(d),

Where C0 and C represent the same as previously
stated, and k (min -1) is the pseudo-ﬁrst order rate
constant of photodegradation. The rate constant was
calculated by using a linear ﬁt to the plot of ln(C0/C)
versus irradiation time. Based on the results from
Fig.
the highest degradation rate was ob-
served for Fe/MgO-rGO(500) with a rate constant of
k=7.072×10-3 min-1, which is 2.86 times higher than
that of Fe/MgO (k=2.479×10-3 min-1). Considering
the degradation eﬃciency and rate constant, Fe/MgO-
rGO(500) can be regarded as a superior solar light
driven photocatalyst to be used for environmental reme-
diation purpose. The mechanism behind this profound
performance of Fe/MgO-rGO(500) has been discussed
subsequently.

Furthermore, to study the role of

light with
diﬀerent wavelengths, the photodegradation ability of
Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite was also evaluated
using a UV cut-oﬀ ﬁlter (λ ≥ 420 nm) where the eﬃ-
ciency was obtained to be only ∼64% (Fig. 6(e)) which
is lower than that obtained under UV-visible irradia-
tion. This result justiﬁes our ﬁndings from optical char-
acterizations, where continuous absorption across the
UV region was exhibited by Fe/MgO-rGO composites.

1. Photostability of Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite

The stability and re-usability of

the Fe/MgO-
rGO(500) nanocomposite has been checked, employ-
ing a recyclability test to validate their applicability

Figure 7. Amount of H2 evolved via water splitting with
respect to irradiation time

in practical ﬁelds [51]. It has been observed from Fig.
6(f) that after four consecutive photo-degradation cy-
cles, the change in dye degradation eﬃciency of the cat-
alyst was trivial, which could be related to the loss in
material during the recovery process. The outcome of
this study anticipates the prospect of this material for
repeated application in waste-water management and
other photocatalytic purposes.

D. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation

We have evaluated the eﬃciency of the synthesized
photocatalysts as a worthy candidate for hydrogen gen-
eration via water splitting under solar irradiation [11].
Fig. 7 demonstrates the amount of H2 gas produced by
our synthesized catalysts as a function of solar irradi-
ation time. For comparison, the hydrogen generation
under identical conditions by titania P25 nanoparticles
was also included. The hydrogen production of com-
mercially available P25 nanoparticles was observed to
be ∼445 μmol g-1. As shown in Fig. 7, Fe/MgO pho-
tocatalyst’s hydrogen evolution is slightly higher than
that of P25 nanoparticles. Notably, the rate of hydro-
gen production increased signiﬁcantly when rGO was
introduced into Fe/MgO, and it was observed that the
total amount of H2 evolved under 4 hours of solar irradi-
ation were ∼1517 and ∼1741 μmol g-1 for the Fe/MgO-
rGO(400) and Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposites, re-
spectively.

It is well established that Photocatalytic H2 gener-
ation mainly includes three basic steps:
(1) absorp-
tion of photons by the photocatalyst to form electron-
hole pairs; (2) separation and migration of the photo-

induced charges to diﬀerent photocatalyst sites; and
(3) reduction of water to evolve H2 on the surface of
the photocatalyst by the photo-generated electrons. In
our case, Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite absorbed a
signiﬁcant amount of photons to produce electron-hole
pairs due to its narrow band gap and graphene, with its
high work function (4.42 eV) and superior conductiv-
ity, played the crucial role by accepting photo-generated
electrons and rapidly migrating these electrons through
its 2D plane to reactive sites, which resulted in a signif-
icant amount of H2 evolution [75, 76]. For further in-
sight, a comparative analysis between our experimental
ﬁndings and some previous related investigations has
been presented in Table 2. Noticeably, our Fe/MgO-
rGO(500) nanocomposite exhibited a comparatively in-
creased H2 evolution rate (HER) than other rGO sup-
ported and MgO based nanocomposites. Additionally,
in most cases, various sacriﬁcial reagents were used as
electron donors to enhance H2 generation rate. How-
ever, in this present investigation, we have obtained a
notable result on solar hydrogen generation by water
splitting without any additional reagent.

E. Photocatalytic mechanism

In order to gain a better perspective of the profound
photocatalytic performance of Fe/MgO-rGO nanocom-
posites, a plausible mechanism for the photodegrada-
tion of RhB under solar illumination is proposed with
the help of a schematic illustration (Fig. 8). The band
edge positions were calculated using the Mulliken elec-
tronegativity method using the following equations [80]

ECB = χ – Ec –

1
2

Eg

EVB = ECB + Eg

(4)

(5)

where ECB and EVB are conduction and valence band
edge potentials with respect to Normal Hydrogen Elec-
trode (NHE) ; χ is the absolute electronegativity, ex-
pressed as the geometric mean of the absolute elec-
tronegativity of the constituent atoms; Eg is the band
gap of the sample and Ec is the energy of free electrons
on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV). It is well established
that, along with optical band gap, CBM (conduction
band minimum) and VBM (valance band maximum)
play crucial roles in catalyzing the redox reactions in the
electrolyte system. Eﬃcient photocatalytic degradation
ability of the nanocomposites can be better understood
by analyzing the redox reactions in the electrolyte sys-
tem that govern the degradation of RhB dye. For suc-
cessful degradation of RhB under solar irradiation two
redox reactions are particularly important. First, the

11

photogenerated electron can react with the surface ad-
sorbed oxygen (redox potential: -0.16 eV vs. NHE) to
form ·O–
radicals, which will further react with RhB to
2
cause degradation. Second, the photogenerated holes
can react with the OH– radicals, ionized from the water
molecules to produce ·OH (redox potential: 2.38 eV vs.
NHE). This ·OH can further oxidize the RhB molecules.
Therefore, a photocatalyst needs to possess a CBM<-
0.16 eV to drive the frst reaction and VBM>2.38 eV to
drive the second one eﬃciently [55].

CBM and VBM for MgO has been determined to be
-1.24 and 2.66 eV, respectively, which imply that MgO
can perform the redox reactions of RhB degradation
since it has fulﬁlled the above mentioned criteria. How-
ever, lower absorption of photons due to the large value
of optical band gap in MgO, resulted in poor photo-
catalytic activity. Introduction of iron Fe3+ ions into
the MgO surface, eﬀectively leads to band gap nar-
rowing, creating a sub level above the valance band
(VB) of MgO. Under solar illumination, electrons in
the VB of MgO can ﬁrstly transfer to Fe intermedi-
ate band through absorbing photons with longer wave-
length, and these electrons then transfer from interme-
diate band to conduction band (CB) leaving holes in the
VB. Moreover, the Fe3+ ions can be reduced to Fe2+
ions by the photogenerated electrons during the photo-
catalysis, which greatly improves the charge separation
with increased lifetime of excited electrons and holes
[81, 82]. Fe2+ ions are relatively unstable when com-
pared to Fe3+ ions, which have half-ﬁlled 3d5 orbital.
Therefore, the trapped charges can easily release from
Fe2+ ions and then migrate to the surface to initiate
the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, Fe2+ ions can
be oxidized to Fe3+ ions by transferring electrons to
absorbed molecular oxygen in the reaction solution, re-
sulting in the formation of reactive superoxide radicals
(·O–
2

) which can further degrade RhB [82].

The Fe/MgO nanoparticles are supposed to be
well attached to the rGO sheets as can be seen in the
TEM images. Due to its excellent electron conductivity,
graphene can greatly promote interfacial charge transfer
and signiﬁcantly improve the photoactivity of Fe/MgO-
graphene nanocomposites. Furthermore, due to the π–π
conjugated interactions between the RhB molecules and
the graphene rings, graphene sheets have an exceptional
ability to adsorb dye molecules in the aqueous medium
[7]. Besides, density-functional theory (DFT) calcula-
tions revealed that the work function (WF) of graphene
is 4.42 eV, indicating the redox potential of rGO/rGO·–
is (-0.08 eV versus NHE) more positive than the CB po-
tential of Fe/MgO (-1.24 eV versus NHE) [83, 84]. This
will result in a thermodynamically convenient transfer
of photogenerated electrons from the CB of Fe/MgO
to the rGO surface, giving the electrons more oppor-
tunities to interact with reactants and participate in
photocatalytic reactions. The photo generated electron

in rGO could react with adsorbed O2 to form ·O–
radi-
2
cals. The majority of ·O–
radicals will be involved in the
2
degradation of RhB molecules, while others may react
with H2O to produce ·OH radicals. Consequently, the
produced ·O–
and ·OH radicals, as well as photogener-
2
ated electrons and holes will react with dye molecules
and degrade it into non-toxic byproducts.

The tentative mechanism can be summarized as

follows

our rGO supported nanocomposites fulﬁl both require-
ments eﬃciently. Therefore, the photogenerated holes
from the nanocomposite with suﬃcient potential can
react with the water molecules and produce H+ along
with O2 and the photogenerated electrons evolve H2 gas
by reducing H+.

Fe/MgO + hν → Fe(e–)/MgO(h+)

Fe3+ + e– → Fe2+

Fe2+ + O2 → Fe3+ + ·O–

A similar model can be suggested for understand-
ing the mechanism behind the superior ability of
Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite for solar H2 produc-
tion through water splitting (ESI Fig. S7). For success-
ful water splitting reaction to take place, CBM potential
of the photocatalyst needs to be lower than the proton
reduction potential (0 eV vs NHE) whereas the VBM
potential needs to be greater than the oxidation poten-
tial of hydroxyl ion (1.23 eV vs NHE) [55]. Notably,

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that incorporation of a poten-
tial electron acceptor and reservoir rGO is an excellent
choice of material to maintain e– and h+ pairs sepa-
rated for a long period by suppression of charge carrier
recombination. This also resulted in an improved opti-
cal absorption and reduction in band gap, all of which
contributed to enhance the photocatalytic performance
of the Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposites as compared to
MgO and widely used P25 nanoparticles. Notably,
the hydrogen production capability via water splitting
of the synthesized nanocomposites, particularly ther-
mally treated Fe/MgO-rGO at 500 ◦C is signiﬁcantly
higher compared to that of MgO, Fe/MgO, commercial
widely used P25 nanoparticles as well as other related
rGO based composites. Based on the current ﬁndings,
the synthesized nanocomposites can be considered as a
promising candidate for numerous photocatalytic appli-
cations such as puriﬁcation of water by removing harm-
ful pollutants, solar water disinfection, and carbon-free
hydrogen production via renewable sources like water
and solar energy. Our ﬁndings with profound insights
into the kinetics of charge transfer may pave the way
for researchers to construct and optimize new graphene-
based nanocomposite photocatalysts to fulﬁll the mod-
ern technological requirements in environmental and
energy-related applications.
