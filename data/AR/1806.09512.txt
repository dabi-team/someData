(Dated: September 3, 2018)

We present a global analysis of the inclusive quasielastic electron scattering data with a super-
scaling approach with relativistic eﬀective mass. The SuSAM* model exploits the approximation
of factorization of the scaling function f ∗(ψ∗) out of the cross section under quasifree conditions.
Our approach is based on the relativistic mean ﬁeld theory of nuclear matter where a relativistic
eﬀective mass for the nucleon encodes the dynamics of nucleons moving in presence of scalar and
vector potentials. Both the scaling variable ψ∗ and the single nucleon cross sections include the
eﬀective mass as a parameter to be ﬁtted to the data alongside the Fermi momentum kF . Sev-
eral methods to extract the scaling function and its uncertainty from the data are proposed and
compared. The model predictions for the quasielastic cross section and the theoretical error bands
are presented and discussed for nuclei along the periodic table from A = 2 to A = 238: 2H, 3H,
3He, 4He, 12C, 6Li, 9Be, 24Mg, 59Ni, 89Y, 119Sn, 181Ta, 186W, 197Au, 16O, 27Al, 40Ca, 48Ca, 56Fe,
208Pb, and 238U. We ﬁnd that more than 9000 of the total ∼ 20000 data fall within the quasielastic
theoretical bands. Predictions for 48Ti and 40Ar are also provided for the kinematics of interest to
neutrino experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Inclusive electron scattering is a powerful tool to study
the quasielastic response of nuclei, which arises in the
region of energy-momentum transfer, (ω, q), dominated
by direct knockout of bound nucleons. These reactions
have experienced a revival due to the recent neutrino
oscillation experiments, which need precise modeling of
neutrino scattering from nuclei at intermediate energies
[1–5]. The recent measurements of CC neutrino and an-
tineutrino cross sections [6–12] have allowed to test the
current models as applied to neutrino scattering. Sys-
tematic diﬀerences between the theoretical predictions of
the neutrino and antineutrino data from diﬀerent groups
have been found [13–21]. Work is in progress to conciliate
the models, trying to ﬁnd the origin of their diﬀerences
and to reduce the systematic errors.

However, in the neutrino experiments the incident en-
ergy cannot be ﬁxed, and the measurements are cross
sections averages weighted by some known neutrino ﬂux.
Therefore the detailed diﬀerences between models of the
quasielastic response of nuclei should be further inves-
tigated through the corresponding predictions for (e, e′)
data. Despite the progress achieved with nuclear mod-

els based on ﬁrst principles [22], the nuclear shell model
[23], or the spectral function theory [24, 25], the high en-
ergies and momenta for the kinematics of interest q ∼ 1
GeV/c require important relativistic corrections [26, 27]
that are not easy to implement in models of ﬁnite nuclei.
Other fundamental requirements like gauge invariance or
oﬀ-shell extrapolations of the currents can also generate
theoretical ambiguities and discrepancies in the results.
Moreover reaction mechanisms modifying the impulse ap-
proximation, such as ﬁnal-state interactions, short-range
correlations, meson-exchange currents, pion emission and
inelastic excitations, make not easy to construct a sensi-
ble model providing a complete description of the whole
set of (e, e′) data at the full range of kinematics.

Relativity not only plays a role in the kinematics and
in the current operator, but also in the dynamics. In a
fully relativistic mean ﬁeld model [28] the scalar and vec-
tor relativistic potentials enlarge the lower components
of the (Dirac) nucleon wave functions in the medium
[29], and this produces a notable enhancement of the
transverse response function. This genuine relativistic
dynamical eﬀect does not appear in semi-relativistic ap-
proximations based in two-components (Pauli) spinors
[27]. Thus, the so called enhancement of the transverse
response [15, 30] cannot be attributed fully to multi-
nucleon processes with meson-exchange currents but also,
and signiﬁcantly, to relativity. This shows that the sep-
aration of 1p-1h and 2p-2h channels in inclusive scatter-
ing is in fact ambiguous and model-dependent. Another
example of ambiguity due to the medium in the chan-

 
 
 
 
 
 
nel expansion appears is the ∆ peak, which usually is
attributed to pion emission with an intermediate ∆ res-
onance, but the ∆ is dressed in the medium and part of
its width is produced by decay into the 2p-1h channel
[31–33] without pions.

Scaling studies are promising phenomenological alter-
In the su-
natives to study the nuclear response [34].
perscaling approach (SuSA) [35–38] the longitudinal re-
sponse function is divided by a single-nucleon structure
function and plotted against a scaling variable ψ′, which
is proportional to the minimum initial momentum of the
nucleons ejected by given momentum and energy transfer
(q, ω). The scaling variable ψ′ is made dimensionless by
using units of the Fermi momentum kF and takes into
account the separation energy by subtraction of a pa-
rameter ǫB to the energy transfer ω. The data, scaled
in this way for diﬀerent kinematics and nuclear species,
are found to collapse into a universal longitudinal scal-
ing function fL(ψ′). The corresponding transverse scal-
ing function fT (ψ′) could not be directly extracted from
the data because the transverse response in contaminated
from non-quasielastic processes explicitly breaking scal-
ing such as pion emission and multinucleon emission orig-
inated mainly by meson exchange currents. In the SuSA
approach it was assumed that fT = fL [38] and this al-
lowed to construct a simple model to predict neutrino
cross sections from the (e, e′) data.

Even with the appropriate relativistic corrections in
the kinematics and currents [27] most of the nuclear mod-
els give fT ≃ fL in the impulse approximation. There-
fore these models —SuSA included— cannot describe
the (e, e′) data without additional transverse enhance-
ment mechanisms. However, including relativity in the
dynamics one naturally ﬁnds an enhancement fT > fL,
going into the right direction for the conciliation with
data. This is the case of the relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF)
model of ﬁnite nuclei [28], which is based on the Dirac-
Hartree theory of ref. [39].

The key ingredient to perform the upgrade SuSA-v2
[40] was to include nuclear eﬀects theoretically-inspired
by the RMF. SuSA-v2 uses an enhanced transverse scal-
ing function fT diﬀerent from fL. The new transverse
scaling function was ﬁtted to (e, e′) cross section data in
a model including also 2p-2h MEC and inelastic contri-
butions [41]. An additional dependence of fT (ψ′) on the
momentum transfer q was needed to reproduce the data.
Therefore the SuSA-v2 results violate scaling, although
the model keeps the word ’scaling’ by tradition.

In recent work we have revisited the scaling approach
by introducing a new scaling function f ∗(ψ∗) including
dynamical relativistic eﬀects [42–44] through the intro-
duction of an eﬀective mass into its deﬁnition. The re-
sulting superscaling approach with relativistic eﬀective
mass (SuSAM*) model describes a large amount of the
electron data lying inside a phenomenological quasielastic
band, and it has been extended recently to the neutrino
and antineutrino sector [45] with success and a fair agree-
ment with the data. SuSAM* was ﬁrst developed from

2

the set of 12C data [42, 43] and later applied to other
nuclei in [44].

The novel point of view of SuSAM* stems from the ob-
servation that a large subset of (e, e′) data collapse into
a thick band which can be parameterized as a QE cen-
tral value f ∗(ψ∗) plus/minus a theoretical uncertainty.
This phenomenological QE scaling band emerges as the
set of selected data which can be considered approxi-
mately quasielastic except for interaction eﬀects which
break scaling just by a little amount. The success to de-
scribe the cross section data with only one scaling func-
tion is due to the the proved good properties of the rel-
ativistic mean ﬁeld, which already includes by construc-
tion the transverse response enhancement [46–48]. More-
over, the new phenomenological scaling function approx-
imately encloses the universal scaling function of the rel-
ativistic Fermi gas

fRFG(ψ∗) =

(1 − ψ∗2)θ(1 − ψ∗2)

(1)

This is so because the mean ﬁeld theory of nuclear
matter already provides a reasonable description of
the quasielastic response function [46–48]. The phe-
nomenological SuSAM* scaling function diﬀers from this
parabolic shape and it can be parameterized as a sum of
two Gaussians. An additional advantage of the SuSAM*
is that it keeps gauge invariance. The original SuSA vio-
lates this fundamental symmetry because it introduces an
energy shift to account for separation energy, and hence
initial and ﬁnal states have a diﬀerent mass, presumably
modifying the vertex function.
In our case the energy
shift is accounted for by the eﬀective mass, typically of
M ∗ = m∗
M /mN ∼ 0.8 for medium-size nuclei.

The goal of the present work is two-fold. First, to per-
form a global simultaneous ﬁt of the SuSAM* parameters
to all the available data on the (e, e′) database compiled
[49–51]. Second, to present in a comprehensive
in refs.
way the model description of the cross section for all the
nuclei included in the ﬁt. We also analyze in more de-
tail several nuclei, and compare the various prescriptions
used to extract the scaling function. Finally we examine
the predictions of our model to new (e, e′) measurements
for the nuclei 48Ti [52] and 40Ar, at present of interest
for current neutrino experiments.

The scheme of the paper is as follows. In Sect. II we
present the formalism for the (e, e′) cross section. In sect.
III we present the results for the the SuSAM* scaling
function. In Sect. IV we present the predictions for the
cross sections of the diﬀerent nuclei. In Sect. V we draw
our conclusions.

scattering and the relativistic mean ﬁeld model of nu-

III. THE SUSAM* APPROACH

In the SuSAM* approach the cross section is computed
by using Eqs. (2,5), but replacing the RFG scaling func-
tion by a phenomenological one f ∗(ψ∗) extracted from
the experimental data.

This can be done in several ways with a careful analysis
of the scaling properties of (e, e′) cross section data. We
carried out such analyses in refs. [42–44].

FIG. 1: Phenomenological scaling function bands compared
to the (e, e′) data scaled with the best parameters of the global
ﬁt and selected with the density criterion. The corresponding
scaling function band C (in pink) is compared to the band B
of ref. [44] (in green). The data are selected from [49–51]

In this work we extend those studies starting with
∼ 20000 experimental (e, e′) cross section data for 21
nuclei: 2H, 3H, 3He, 4He, 12C, 6Li, 9Be, 24Mg, 59Ni, 89Y,
119Sn, 181Ta, 186W, 197Au, 16O, 27Al, 40Ca, 48Ca, 56Fe,
208Pb, and 238U. For every datum we compute the corre-
sponding experimental scaling function f ∗
exp by dividing
the experimental cross section by the single nucleon func-
tion introduced in the last section.

From the experimental kinematics we also compute the
corresponding value of the scaling variable ψ∗. When
we plot f ∗ versus ψ∗ one observes that a subset of data
are concentrated around a band, but the scaling is not
perfect. One then tries to change the values of the pa-
rameters M ∗ and kF up to ﬁnd the best scaling possible.
The analysis has been developed in several stages that
we describe next. For completeness, we summarize with
some details what we did in the past works [42–44], while
we will explain in depth those aspects of the ﬁts that were
not accounted for previously. The goals of this section
are:

1. To show the self consistency of the extraction of the

scaling function,

2. to check that the diﬀerent methods produce similar

results for the SuSAM* parameters, and

3. to perform a global ﬁt of the parameters and scaling

function simultaneously.

A. The scaling function

We started with the 12C data, by tuning the parame-
ters M ∗ and kF until one ﬁnds the best scaling possible.

5

This was reached in [42] for M ∗ = 0.8 and kF = 225
MeV/c. By applying a density criterion, a data cloud
around the RFG scaling function was selected. Accord-
ing with the criterion we selected those scaled data sur-
rounded by more than 25 data inside a circle of radius
r = 0.1 in the f ∗(ψ∗) graph. These selected data deﬁned
a “QE” region as a thick band which we parameterized
as a combination of two Gaussian functions [43]

The parameters of this band A are given in Tab. I.

Starting with band A we applied in ref.

[44] several
methods to obtain the relativistic eﬀective mass and the
Fermi momentum of all the nuclei from the periodic ta-
ble, for which (e, e′) data existed in our data base, taken
from [49, 50]. With these values of (kF , M ∗) parameters
we veriﬁed that all these nuclei approximately scale sim-
ilarly to the 12C ones. These parameters are shown in
columns 2–7 of table II. For this work we have revised
the analysis of [44] for the nuclei 2H and 3He, which have
been updated in Tab. II.

The procedure required to obtain ﬁrst kF and M ∗ for
all the nuclei from a visual ﬁt (columns 2–3 of Tab. II),
providing a good qualitative scaling of the experimental
data. With these parameters we scaled the data for the
twelve main nuclei of the data base. Then, we proceeded
to a more precise determination of the phenomenological
scaling function by discarding those kinematics where the
energy transfer at the QE peak is lower than ∼ 80 − 100
MeV, and also those of high energy were the QE peak is
indistinguishable due to inelastic dominance.

With this set of data a density criterion was newly ap-
plied, obtaining a new SuSAM* phenomenological band.
In [44] that scaling band was parameterized as the sum
of two Gaussians, modiﬁed to improve the low energy
region by applying a Fermi function.

The parameters of this scaling function are given in Table
I. They are labeled as ’band B’. We provide the param-
eters of the lower (min), and upper (max) limits of the
boundary, deﬁning the uncertainty band. The central pa-
rameters correspond to the best ﬁt to the selected data.
Band B is shown as the green band in Fig. 1. This is
compared to the band C that is obtained in the global
ﬁt explained below. Both bands are similar around the
quasielastic region, and therefore they are interchange-
able in cross section calculations. Band B is the one used
in the SuSAM* model of next section to compute the QE
cross sections of nuclei.

Note that the scaling band shown in Fig. 1 is well
deﬁned only in the quasielastic region −1 < ψ∗ < 1,
while we cannot describe in detail the left tail of the
cross section, corresponding to ψ∗ < −1, and related
to higher momentum components produced mainly by
nucleon-nucleon short range correlations [55, 56], which

yond of the scope of the present work.

B. The parameters kF and M ∗

We recall that band B was obtained in the last sub-
section from the scaling of data using a visual ﬁt of the
parameters kF and M ∗. For consistency it is pertinent
to recompute those parameters with a more quantitative
procedure, which we describe next. This will allow us
also to obtain in return an estimate of their uncertain-
ties. We can proceed in two diﬀerent ways, which ulti-
mately produce similar results for the parameters. The
ﬁrst is to maximize the number of points inside band B.
The resulting parameters are given in columns 4 and 5 of
table II. The second method is to minimize a χ2 function
computed from the distances of the data to the center
of the band for each nucleus, divided by the total error,
taking into account the band width

were we have added in quadrature in the denominator the
experimental and theoretical errors. The parameters re-
sulting from minimization of this χ2 are given in columns
6 and 7 of table II.

Note that the number of points N ′

QE = NQE included
in the sum has been selected by leaving only the points
that are clearly around the QE peak. These numbers

of points are presented in the tenth column of Table II,
together with the total number of points before the se-
lection, which are shown in the eleventh column of the
same table. The same data set used in the χ2 minimiza-
tion has been used in the maximization of the number of
points inside the band. However in the case of the nuclei
2H and 3He, revised in the present work, we have to in-
clude in the χ2 only those points with −1 < ψ∗ < 1 to
obtain reasonable results. Therefore, for these two nuclei
N ′
QE < NQE. For nine of the nuclei the number of exper-
imental data is not large enough to obtain a reasonable
ﬁt, and those are hence not appearing in columns 4, 5 of
table II.

The values of the parameters kF and M ∗ obtained by
these quantitative ﬁts are similar between them, and are
also similar to the ones used in the visual ﬁt from which
band B was obtained. The agreement between the pa-
rameters obtained with diﬀerent ﬁts faithfully points to
the steadiness and robustness of the present scaling ap-
proach for this purpose.

Besides, these methods allow to compute estimations
of the theoretical errors in the parameters. The proce-
dure is illustrated in the color maps of Figs. 2 and 3 for
six selected nuclei.

In Fig. 2 we show the no. of data inside band B di-
vided by the maximum, Nband/Nmax as a function of M ∗
and kF . We show the cloud where Nband/Nmax changes
between 0.9 and 1. This means that changing the pa-
rameters around the position of the maximum inside the
cloud the no. of data that get out of band B is less than
10% of the maximum Nmax. Note that for some nuclei

FIG. 3: Color maps of the χ2 of the QE data with the phenomenological band, divided by χ2
min, as a function of the eﬀective
mass M ∗ and Fermi momentum kF for diﬀerent nuclei. The region with χ2 above 10% of the minimum is shown in white. The
region with χ2 below 10% of the minimum is ﬁtted by a ellipse. The σ − ω model of ref. [47] is shown as comparison.

there is more than one maximum. In that case we dis-
play in Tab. II the values closer to the σ − ω theory of
the Walecka model [47] , also shown in the ﬁgure. Note
that maximizing the number of points inside the band is
a discretized procedure and as consequence the shapes of
the clouds deviate from a regular elliptic shape and this
does not allow to parameterize the error in a systematic
way.

The χ2 minimization method shown in Fig. 3 is more
appropriate to this end. In the ﬁgure we show the cloud
in parameter space where the χ2 values divided by the
minimum χ2
min are in the range 1.0–1.1. The resulting
10%-change clouds are more elliptic shaped and smaller
than the clouds of ﬁg. 2. With these plots we are able to
parameterize the cloud shapes using ellipses with three
constants, a, b, θ:

kF (s) = (kF )c

+300MeV/c[a cos θ sin(s) + b sin θ cos(s)] (25)
(26)
c − a sin θ sin(s) + b cos θ cos(s)

M ∗(s) = M ∗

Where s is the parameter of the ellipse. The ellipse pa-
rameters encode the errors in kF , M ∗ ( 10% conﬁdence
interval) and they are given in table III. Note that the
centers of the ellipses are not exactly at the minimum χ2
position because we are just interested in a rough esti-
mation of the error and therefore we compute the ellipses
with a ﬁnite variation of 10% in the χ2 value.

Notice that the maximum of the number of points in-
side the band does not coincide with the minimum of χ2.
This is so because a set of points inside the band can

occupy diﬀerent positions resulting in diﬀerent values of
the χ2. Thus, the value of χ2 is not directly related to
Nband, although some correlations can be found between
these two functions. The correlations between Nband and
χ2 depend on the particular nucleus, and the selected set
of quasielastic data entering in the ﬁt. This correlation
is shown in Fig. 4 for six of the nuclei. In the ﬁgure we
display the values of χ2 versus Nband for diﬀerent values
of kF , M ∗ around the extreme regions shown in Figs.
2, 3. The correlation between χ2 and Nband is stronger
when Nband increases and χ2 decreases. But we clearly
observe that the maxima of Nband do not minimize χ2,
but they are close to do it.

C. The global ﬁt

One of the goals of the present paper is to validate the
universality of the the scaling function by investigating
the self consistency of the extraction method by an al-
ternative way. In order to guarantee that the procedure
is independent on a particular nuclear species, we have
developed a global approach where the scaling function is
not given a priori. Instead we ﬁt at the same time all the
parameters of the model, including the scaling function
f ∗(ψ∗), and the Fermi momentum and eﬀective mass of
all the nuclei simultaneously. This global ﬁt maximizes
the number of QE data points, f ∗
exp(ψ∗), falling inside a
band around a scaling function, which we parameterize
as a modiﬁed combination of Gaussians with eight pa-

rameters, as given in Eq. (23). We apply the downhill
simplex method with ﬁfty parameters (the Fermi mo-
menta and eﬀective mass of 21 nuclei, M ∗, kF , plus the
eight parameters of the scaling function). The “scaling”
band used in the ﬁt has a constant width. It is deﬁned by
the limits f ∗(ψ∗) ± 0.1, i.e., for each datum and for each
set of parameters we accept the datum inside the band if
|f ∗(ψ∗)exp − f ∗(ψ∗)| < 0.1. We start with ’good’ initial
parameters obtained in one of the previous separate ﬁts.
The result of this ﬁt is shown in the top panel of ﬁg. 5.
The values of kF and M ∗ are given in columns 8 and 9 of
table II. The parameters of the scaling function are given
in table I as the central part of band C.

This global ﬁt only allows to obtain the central part
of the scaling function but not the width of the band,
which for the ﬁt purposes has been ﬁxed to a reasonable
value chosen as ±0.1, because in the previous analyses we
have seen that this is the observed order of magnitude.
To ﬁnish the extraction of the phenomenological band
we therefore apply again a density criterion to select the
true QE data to all the QE data scaled with the global
parameters. We then obtain the set of true “scaling”
QE data shown in ﬁg. 1. There are 4230 points in that
ﬁgure, which are a 70% of all the points entering in the
ﬁt. These points clearly deﬁne a band which is again
parameterized in the same way as before as in Eq. (23)
and the parameters are given in table 1 as band C. This
band is shown in pink in Fig. 1. We can see that the
result of this global ﬁt is very similar to band B obtained
by partial ﬁts. These results enforce the self consistency
hypothesis and the universality of the scaling function

obtained.

To gain a perspective of the quality of the results we
show in the middle panel of Fig. 5 all the data points
(not only the QE ones) for all the nuclei scaled with the
parameters of the global ﬁt. Clearly a large fraction of
data collapse into a dark shadow which resembles to our
previously determined bands. In the bottom panel of ﬁg-
ure 5 the same points are compared to the global scaling
function and band C. In fact the number of points that
collapse inside band C in ﬁg. 5 is more than 9000 of the
total ∼ 20000 data.

IV. CROSS SECTION RESULTS

In this section we use the phenomenological scaling
function of Eq. (23) and the parameters corresponding
to band B of table I, to compute the (e, e′) cross sec-
tion, using the Fermi momenta and eﬀective masses of
columns 6 and 7 of table II. The SuSAM* model pre-
dicts a central cross section inside a theoretical uncer-
tainty band. The width of the cross section band is re-
lated to the width of our parameterized scaling function
for band B. Note that in the cross section the absolute
value of the band width depends on the kinematics and
on the nuclear species. This is because the cross section
is obtained from the scaling function by multiplication
by a kinematical-dependent function. Our cross section
results are here compared to experimental data for the
21 nuclei included in our ﬁt. This comparison with the
SuSAM* model has only been done before for the case of

12C [43] and 16O [45]. We also make comparisons with
the new data for 48Ti and 12C performed in a recent
experiment at JLab [52] and provide predictions for the
40Ar nucleus corresponding to the kinematics of interest
for the JLab experiment, that plans to extract the Argon
spectral function.

The present results have also been studied by using
bands A and C and parameters kF , M ∗ from the diﬀerent
ﬁts described in the last section. The global behavior of

9

the result and the conclusions of this work are roughly
preserved by using any of the three parameterized scaling
functions and bands.

In ﬁgs. 6–17 we show the predictions of our model
for the (e, e′) cross section compared to selected experi-
mental data for each nucleus in the database, from 2H to
238U. The global description is quite acceptable given the
simplicity of the SuSAM* model. A large subset of data
fall inside the uncertainty band. In fact, most of the data
used to perform the ﬁt are inside our prediction bands
by construction. The data that lie outside our prediction
bands are typically those in the inelastic or deep region
and those corresponding to low momentum transfer, and
therefore breaking ψ∗-scaling because they fall outside
the quasielastic region deﬁned in ﬁg. 1. Alternatively,
intermediate energy QE data falling outside our bands
may indicate the existence of nuclear eﬀects beyond the
impulse approximation such as meson-exchange currents
(MEC) or breaking the factorization approximation, like
strong ﬁnal state interactions.

In what follows we discuss in some detail the cross
section description for every single nucleus considered in
our study.

A. The nucleus 2H

The lighter nucleus considered in the ﬁt corresponds to
2H, shown in Fig. 6. We use the χ2 ﬁt values from Tab. II
for the Fermi momentum, kF = 82 MeV/c, and eﬀective
mass M ∗ = 1. The fact that the SuSAM* —based on the
Fermi gas equations— reproduces a large fraction of deu-
terium data could seem shocking. But what our results
reﬂect is that the deuterium quasielastic cross section is
compatible with a momentum distribution of moderate
extension, kF ∼ 82 MeV/c. This behavior dominates
around the quasielastic region −1 < ψ∗ < 1, while we
in general sub-estimate the left tail of the cross section,
corresponding to ψ∗ < −1, and is related to PN short
range correlations.

B. The nuclei 3H, and 3He

The A = 3 light nuclei analyzed, 3H and 3He, are
shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. They are even
better described than 2H, with slightly diﬀerent Fermi
momenta, kF = 136 and 130 MeV/c for H and He,
respectively. The eﬀective mass takes the same value
M ∗ = 0.98 for both nuclei. The value of the Fermi mo-
mentum diﬀer from the other ﬁts, see tab. II, ranging
between 120–140 MeV/c. All these values of kF give
qualitatively similar predictions for the cross section, be-
cause the cross section dependence on kF is mild in a
small momentum interval. The dependence on M ∗ is
found to be stronger. However note that the diﬀerences
between the adjusted parameters for these nuclei can also

them.

C. The nucleus 4He

E. The nuclei 6Li , 9Be , 24Mg , 59Ni , 89Y , 119Sn ,
181Ta , 186W, and 197Au

The 4He nucleus is the nucleus with more quasielas-
tic data in the database, and is one with the better
scaling properties. Selected cross section predictions are
shown in Fig. 9, computed with kF = 180 MeV/c and
M ∗ = 0.86, although equally good results can be ob-
tained with kF = 160 MeV/c and M ∗ = 0.9. Comparing
with the cases A = 2, 3 we clearly see that the Fermi
momentum increases with A, and the eﬀective mass de-
creases with A. The QE cross section description is quite
good for many kinematics. It is remarkable that, given
its simplicity, for intermediate energy the SuSAM* model
seems to be as good as the more recent ab initio calcula-
tions [57] with relativistic corrections. In our view, this
is so because the main dynamical ingredients of the QE
processes are embedded into our model via the connec-
tion between relativity and eﬀective mass.

For these nuclei there are only a few set of kinemat-
ics available in the database, usually ∼ 20–40 QE data
points only. Therefore it is not possible to determine the
parameters with high precision by maximizing the num-
ber of points inside the band, because there are many ar-
rangements of the data points compatible with the the-
oretical band. For this same reason the χ2 ﬁt to each
nuclei usually provides a good description of the exper-
imental data for intermediate energy kinematics, where
the scaling approach works better. This is shown in Fig.
11 with the parameters kF and M ∗ taken from columns 6
and 7 of table II. The QE data from Li to Au all fall with
our band and are in general well described by the cen-
tral value, with the exception of Mg and Au, which are
slightly underestimated and overestimated at the peak
position, respectively.

D. The nucleus 12C

F. The nucleus 16O

Results for 12C are shown in Fig. 10. We use kF = 217
MeV/c and M ∗ = 0.8. Note that the SuSAM* model
was ﬁrst introduced in Ref.
[43], where a comparison
with all 12C data was provided using band A of Tab. I
and kF = 225 MeV/c. This value of the Fermi momen-
tum was obtained with a visual ﬁt. In this work we have
upgraded this description using band B, which incorpo-
rates a better description for low energy. But in general
both descriptions are globally of the same quality around
the QE peak. This nucleus is, together with 4He, one of
the better described nuclei taking into account the high
number of data existing in the data base, ∼ 2800 each of

There are only a limited number of kinematics avail-
able for 16O. However they are enough for performing all
the ﬁts, with a good global description of data. We ob-
tain kF = 250 MeV/c in the χ2 ﬁt and M ∗ = 0.79. In
the global and visual ﬁt the Fermi momentum is more
similar to that of 12C. The comparison of band B with
the experimental (e, e′) cross section was shown in Fig.
1 of ref.
[45], where the SuSAM* parameters were ﬁrst
extracted for this nucleus, in order to aply the SuSAM*
model to neutrino scattering on water, of interest for the
recent T2K experiment [12]. More experimental kine-
matics for the (e, e′) reaction on 16O would be needed to

G. The nucleus 27Al

A number of ∼ 100 QE-like data are available for 27Al
in the data base. We show three kinematic sets in Fig.
12. This allows to extract kF = 249 MeV/c and M ∗ =
0.8 in the χ2 ﬁt. Even with so limited number of data,

it is also possible to extract these values by maximizing
the number of points inside the band, obtaining similar
values kF = 258 MeV/c, and M ∗ = 0.78. In the global ﬁt
the Fermi momentum is slightly reduced to 233 MeV/c,
similar to the visual ﬁt value.

dant electron scattering experimental data for interme-
diate energy and this allows a precise determination of
kF ∼ 240 MeV/c and M ∗ ∼ 0.7. Cross section results
for this nucleus are shown in Fig. 15. A fair description
of the data is obtained for incident energies ǫ < 2 GeV.

J. The nucleus 208Pb

For heavy nuclei the SuSAM* description is still pos-
sible even if the model is based on the factorization of
a single nucleon cross section, which is expected to be
violated by a strong ﬁnal-state interaction (FSI) on nu-
clei such as 208Pb, shown in Fig. 16. An indication
is that the value of χ2/NQE, given in the last column
of Table II, is bigger than one for all the heavy nuclei

with abundant number of data. In particular, for lead,
χ2/NQE = 1.223. This ﬁt provides a Fermi momentum
kF = 233 MeV/c, similar to the values obtained for other
medium/light nuclei, and eﬀective mass M ∗ = 0.56. The
other ﬁts performed give rather similar numbers for these
parameters. We have tried to include Coulomb correc-
tions for this nucleus in terms of an eﬀective momentum,
but the results actually worsen. Additional eﬀects be-
yond the impulse approximation mainly meson exchange
currents, are expected to be specially important for this
nucleus, and should be investigated in more depth in the
future.

K. The nucleus 238U

Results for the heaviest nucleus analyzed, 238U, are
shown in Fig. 17. Even if the number of existent QE data
is not so big as for lead, the description of this nucleus is
the worst of all the nuclei analyzed. The χ2/NQE = 1.74
is the largest appearing in the last column of Table II, and
the Fermi momentum obtained in the ﬁt is surprisingly
low kF = 219 MeV/c, compared to lighter nuclei. More-
over in the global ﬁt a very diﬀerent value is obtained

kF = 255 MeV/c, closer to the expected value of nuclear
matter. This again indicates that for heavy nuclei strong
eﬀects breaking the impulse approximation and the su-
perscaling hypothesis should play an important role in
the QE regime.

L. M ∗ uncertainty

from where

In the previous results we have assumed that the eﬀec-
tive mass is a constant parameter, which is determined
by the position of the QE peak. While our parameter-
ization of the scaling function in general describes well
the position of the QE peak, we observe deviations for
some kinematics. In fact it is observed that for large Q2
the QE peaks shows a shift to high energy. This is ob-
served in particular, for 4He when ω > 300 MeV. One
could try to improve the description by using a diﬀerent
’optimal’ eﬀective mass for each kinematics. In ﬁgure 18
we show this ’optimal’ eﬀective mass computed for eight
nuclei for each experimental kinematical set. Each set is
deﬁned by ﬁxed incident electron energy and scattering
angle. This eﬀective mass is plotted as a function of ω
at the QE peak. The optimal eﬀective mass has been
computed from the maximum of the experimental cross
section by imposing the quasielastic condition

ω =

(27)

M ∗ =

(28)

This allows us to estimate a theoretical uncertainty
in the eﬀective mass obtained from the SuSAM* bands
by this method, shown as the blue circles deﬁning the
borders of the green uncertainty band in Fig. 18. The
circles in Fig. 18 have been obtained for each experimen-
tal kinematics from our cross section prediction by the
method displayed for example in ﬁg. 19 for a kinematics
in 48Ca. The used method is as follows. We ﬁrst draw
the horizontal segment crossing the maximum of the cen-
tral cross section. Then, we compute the two points Pu
and Pd at the upper border of the band. These points are
an estimation of the minimum and maximum ω position
of the theoretical QE peak allowed by our band. From
these two ωu and ωd we compute the up, M ∗
u, and down,
M ∗
d , values of the eﬀective mass by Eq. (28). This gives
us the two values of the ’optimal’ eﬀective mass shown in
the bottom panel of Fig. 19, each one at a diﬀerent ω po-
sition, ωu and ωd, respectively. Repeating this procedure
for each experimental kinematics, we have obtained the
blue circles in Fig. 18. Finally, to obtain the green bands

FIG. 19: Relativistic eﬀective mass M ∗ computed from the

mental bands for M ∗ have been obtained from the SuSAM*

computing the lower and upper limits for the eﬀective mass

deﬁning our estimation of the eﬀective mass uncertainty
by this procedure, we ﬁt the borders of the band to the
resulting points using the parameterization

neutrino experiments. In the electron scattering experi-
ment the cross section of 12C for the same kinematics was
also measured for calibration. These data are compared
with the SuSAM* model in Fig. 20. In the upper panels
we show our predictions using the parameter values from
the previous ﬁt, i.e., kF ∼ 217 MeV/c for A = 12 and
kF ∼ 240 MeV/c for A = 48, and M ∗ = 0.8 for both
nuclei. We observe that our central prediction is slightly
shifted towards high energy transfer with respect to the
data for both nuclei. This means that for this particular
kinematics a higher value for the eﬀective mass is favored.
In fact the 12C data are better described using M ∗ = 0.9,
and 48Ti needs M ∗ = 0.85 (see lower panels of Fig. 20).
This is related again to the fact that the RMF model
with a constant eﬀective mass starts to fail for high mo-
mentum transfer, favoring an energy dependence of the
eﬀective mass, as mentioned in the previous subsection.
The values of Fermi momenta are similar to those used
in the analysis performed in [52] for this kinematics.

To ﬁnish we show in the last column of Fig. 20 our pre-
dictions for the 40Ar(e, e′) quasielastic cross section for
the same kinematics, of interest for the new experiments
being performed at JLab [52, 58, 59]. For argon we show
our band prediction for kF = 240 MeV/c and for two
possible values of the eﬀective mass for this kinematics,
M ∗ = 0.8 and 0.85. The knowledge of the experimen-
tal cross section for this kinematics would be useful in
our formalism to extract the precise value of the eﬀec-
tive mass, needed to describe the neutrino cross section
for the same kinematics. Note that, although a previous
experiment on Ar [60, 61] there exist, the momentum
transfer is too low for a reasonable simultaneous extrac-
tion of the eﬀective mass and the Fermi momentum with
our formalism.

An estimation of the uncertainty in M ∗ can be obtained

The values of the parameters Au,d, Bu,d and ∆M ∗ are
given in table IV. Their values ammount roughly ∼ 0.1
except for deuterium. The uncertainties in the eﬀective
mass are larger for heavier nuclei.

M. Predictions for 48Ti and 40Ar

In ref.

[52] the ﬁrst measurement of the 48Ti(e, e′)
cross section at Jeﬀerson Lab was reported. The beam
energy is E = 2.222 GeV and electron scattering angle
θ = 15.541 deg. over a broad range of energy transfer.
The purpose of this experiment was to obtain accurate
quasielastic cross section data for the nuclei Ti (Z = 22)
and Ar (N = 22) to extract information needed for the

In this paper we have analyzed the world data of inclu-
sive quasielastic electron scattering within the SuSAM*
model. This is a novel scaling approach based on the
relativistic mean ﬁeld model of nuclear matter instead
of the more usual non-interacting relativistic Fermi gas.
The new scaling variable ψ∗ thus incorporates dynami-
cal ingredients through the relativistic eﬀective mass M ∗
which emerges from the scalar and vector potentials in
the Walecka model. We have applied several methods to
obtain a phenomenological scaling function f ∗(ψ∗) from
the inclusive (e, e′) reaction data. Our procedure is to
start from a scaling function extracted from 12C data as
initial guess, and use it to extract the eﬀective mass and
Fermi momentum of the remaining nuclei. In this work
we have checked that this method is consistent with per-
forming a global ﬁt of the scaling function and all the
parameters kF , M ∗ over the full database for 21 nuclei.
Thus, superscaling has been shown to be valid for a
large body of the (e, e′) data, because the experimental
scaling function f ∗(ψ∗) collapses into a thick band that

FIG. 20: Inclusive (e, e′) cross sections of 12C, 48Ti and 40Ar for the kinematics ǫ = 2222 MeV, θ = 15.541o, of the recent JLab
experiment [52], compared to the SuSAM* model as a function of energy transfer.

here has been parameterized with combinations of simple
Gaussian functions. This unique function allows to de-
scribe the intermediate energy QE cross section for light
to heavy nuclei, from 2H to 238U, with tabulated values
of kF and M ∗. Our ﬁt has also allowed to estimate the
error in the extracted parameters ∆kF ∼ 10 MeV/c and
∆M ∗ ∼ 0.1.

Three similar parameterizations, A, B, C, of the phe-
nomenological scaling function f ∗(ψ∗) and uncertainty
band have been tabulated. With these we have presented
a systematic analysis of the predicted QE cross sections
and uncertainties compared to the data. We observe that
the uncertainty band thickness depends on the kinemat-
ics. More than 9000 data of the total 20000 data are
found to be ’quasielastic’ as they fall inside the uncer-
tainty band. The present results have been shown using
band B, but they have also been studied by using bands
A and C and parameters kF , M ∗ from the diﬀerent ﬁts.
The global results and the conclusions of this work are
preserved against these alternative parameterizations.

Our model provides one of the best global descriptions
of QE data with a single nuclear model. The success is
due not only because its parameters have been obtained
by ﬁtting the inclusive cross section directly. One crucial

reason for the good results is because our model con-
tains by construction the enhancement of the transverse
components of the electromagnetic current. This is due
to the dynamical enhancement of the lower components
of the Dirac spinors by eﬀect of the relativistic eﬀective
mass in nuclei, which is lighter than in free space.

Our model only requires the assumptions of gauge in-
variance, relativity and scaling, which determines the val-
ues of the relativistic eﬀective mass and the Fermi mo-
mentum. The model is blind to the sorts of nuclear ef-
fects involved in the quasielastic interaction, which are
encoded into the scaling function f ∗(ψ∗) and its uncer-
tainty band. Whatever nuclear eﬀect which breaks the
impulse approximation or the factorization of the cross
section on which scaling is based, is included only on the
average. These may include MEC and FSI as more di-
rect candidates, but also short range correlations, which
should be more important for negative values of the scal-
ing variable ψ∗ < −1, out of the range of the ﬁt made
here. These very same eﬀects probably give rise to many
of the experimental data falling outside our bands. In fu-
ture work we expect to reduce the band thickness adding
to the scaling model a contribution from MEC in the 2p-
2h channel, which explicitly accounts for speciﬁc scaling

 
 
 
 
violations.

Our scaling function parameterization also provides a
simple test for theoretical studies, which should fall inside
the SuSAM* uncertainty band. The universality of the
scaling function allows this model to be extended to pro-
vide tight constraints in quasielastic neutrino scattering
for a wide variety of targets. In particular we have pro-
vided predictions for the (e, e′) cross section of Argon, of
interest to current and upcoming neutrino experiments.
