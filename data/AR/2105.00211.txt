ABSTRACT

This paper describes an Autoregressive Partially-hidden Markov model (ARPHMM) for fault de-
tection and prognostics of equipments based on sensors’ data. It is a particular dynamic Bayesian
network that allows to represent the dynamics of a system by means of a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) and an autoregressive (AR) process. The Markov chain assumes that the system is switching
back and forth between internal states while the AR process ensures a temporal coherence on sensor
measurements. A sound learning procedure of standard ARHMM based on maximum likelihood
allows to iteratively estimate all parameters simultaneously. This paper suggests a modiﬁcation of the
learning procedure considering that one may have prior knowledge about the structure which becomes
partially hidden. The integration of the prior is based on the Theory of Weighted Distributions
which is compatible with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm in the sense that the convergence
properties are still satisﬁed. We show how to apply this model to estimate the remaining useful life
based on health indicators. The autoregressive parameters can indeed be used for prediction while
the latent structure can be used to get information about the degradation level. The interest of the
proposed method for prognostics and health assessment is demonstrated on CMAPSS datasets.

1 AR-Markov modelling for prognostics

Autoregressive (AR) models have been shown to be appropriate for time-series modelling in various ﬁelds such
as econometric [1] and climate forecasting [2]. In condition monitoring, it is generally used for fault detection by
establishing an AR model using healthy conditions under various loads and using this model on the observed data
recorded in in-service conditions in order to trend the residual signals. Such approaches does not make use of analytical
description of faults or collection of typical fault patterns [3, 4]. Such a method has been used for gear monitoring by
[5], and [6] used a similar approach together with a logit model to determine the probability of failure of an elevator
door motion system. [7] suggested to use a pole representation of an AR process to detect bearings faults. [8] compared
ARIMA (AR with integrated moving average) with two other models for battery prognostics.

In structural safety, AR models were used by [9, 10] to identify structural dynamic characteristics of system subjected
to ambient excitations. [11] suggested to use an ARMA to characterize and reconstruct fatigue loads for prognostics
application on mechanical components. The authors proposed to adapt the parameters of this model by Bayesian
updating to accommodate variability in loading and data sparsity.

[12] were interested in the modelling of switching autoregressive dynamics from multivariate vital sign time series
in order to stratify mortality risks of intensive care units patients receiving particular treatments. In this biomedical
application, the authors made use of a combination of an AR process and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) called
ARHMM. Such a model is able to cope with multistate non-stationary systems which are generally encountered in
PHM applications.

ARHMM were also used for wind turbine monitoring by [13] where the authors were interested in the statistical
representation of wind time series. They made use of a hidden Markov chain which represents the weather types
and allows to switch between several autoregressive models that describe the time evolution of the wind speed. Such
switching models are particular well suited for PHM applications to represent the dynamical behavior of complex
systems [14, 15].

Initially proposed for speech recognition [16], an ARHMM is a particular dynamic Bayesian network that draws beneﬁts
of an AR model and HMM. A standard and sound learning procedure of this model based on maximum likelihood
(ML) allows parameters to be estimated iteratively and simultaneously. This paper suggests to use ARHMM for fault
detection and prognostics of equipments based on sensors’ data. A modiﬁcation of the learning procedure is also
proposed to enable one to add prior knowledge on the latent structure. This modiﬁcation allows, in some way, to
decrease the attachment of the model to the data that can be observed in practice in various probabilistic models learned
with the ML approach.

Following previous work on the integration of prior on latent variables for fault detection [17, 18, 19, 20], the objective
is to enable the users of probabilistic models to represent two kinds of knowledge [21, 22]:

• Generic knowledge about the data generating process and corresponding to random uncertainty. It pertains to
a population of observables such as historical facts, laws of physics, statistical and common sense knowledge.
• Speciﬁc knowledge, also called relative knowledge or factual evidence, is about a given realization of the data.

It pertains to a particular situation and is related to a domain or a discipline.

Speciﬁc knowledge is of key importance for PHM applications. It is not necessarily related to statistics and is generally
partial because the observation process is imperfect due to lack of knowledge. It generally aims at improving skills of a
method trained by generic knowledge.

The integration of the prior suggested in this paper for ARHMM is based on the Theory of Weighted Distributions
(TWD) [23] which is compatible with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in the sense that the convergence
properties are still satisﬁed. It makes use of concepts initially developed by [17, 22] based on Dempster-Shafer’s theory
of belief functions and of [24] using the TWD to include prior in EM-based learning procedures.

The resulting model is called Autoregressive Partially-Hidden Markov Model (ARPHMM) and is described in the next
section. It is then shown to be well suited for remaining useful life (RUL) based on health indicators with an illlustration
on CMAPSS datasets [25, 26].

2 Markov switching model with soft prior: General formulation

A measurement at time t, xt is mathematically represented as a weighted sum of the previous measurements plus an
error term, where the weights are deﬁned conditionally to each state:

xt = −

∆
(cid:88)

δ=1

rδ(yt)xt−δ + εεεt(yt), 1 ≤ t ≤ T

(1)

The noise term

εεεt(yt) ∼ N (0, ΣΣΣyt)
is assumed to be a Gaussian with zero mean and a covariance matrix ΣΣΣyt automatically adjusted for each hidden state
given the data in the learning phase. The AR coefﬁcients for the i-th state are denoted as rδ(yt = i) where δ = 1 . . . ∆
is the time lag. The set of AR coefﬁcients is given by:

(cid:16)

Bi =

r1(i), . . . , rδ(i), . . . , r∆(i)

(cid:17)

(2)

The switching between internal states is governed by a stochastic process taking the form of a Markov chain and
depicted in Figure 1. It is represented by a transition matrix A with elements aij = p(yt = j|yt−1 = i) (probability of
going into state j at time t given the state was i at t−1). The prior probability of the chain is denoted as ΠΠΠ = [π1 . . . πK],
where πi is the probability to be in state i at time t = 1.

2.1

Incorporating prior knowledge on latent variables

The problem is to estimate the parameters

λ = (A, π, Bi, ΣΣΣi), 1 ≤ i ≤ K

(3)

in presence of uncertain and imprecise prior information about the hidden variables.

The prior is supposed to take the form of distributions over possible internal states given AE signals and represent users’
beliefs before some evidence is taken into account. For practical use, we assume the prior to be uncertain and imprecise
so that we can cover different learning paradigms: Unsupervised learning (health states Y are supposed hidden),
supervised learning (states corresponds to class fully known), semi-supervised learning (combination of both previous
cases) and partially-supervised learning were some health states can be known and accompanied by a conﬁdence degree
W = [w1; . . . ; wt; . . . ; wT ], with wt = [wt(1), . . . , wt(i), . . . , wt(K)] and wt(i) ≥ 0. This is the most general case:

• When wt(i) = 1 for a given state i and wt(j) = 0, j (cid:54)= i then the supervised case is recovered;

• When ∀t, ∀i, wt(i) = 0, then the unsupervised case is recovered.

In order to estimate the parameters of an ARPHMM in a sound manner when some prior knowledge W about the
hidden states is available, we suggest an approach using the TWD described by Patil [23] and we derive the optimal
solution in terms of maximum likelihood. It follows a similar reasoning to [24, 27] and has connections with [22].

2.2

Inference and learning in ARPHMM

The parameters (Eq. 3) are optimized by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning procedure [28]. In the E-step,
we evaluate the expectation of the hidden variables given the data; In the M-step, the auxiliary function Q has to be
maximized in order to ensure that the likelihood will increase at each iteration, where Q (at iteration q) given by:

Q(λ, λ(q)) = E

λ(q)[log(L(λ; Z)|X]

(cid:88)

=

p(Y |X, λ(q)) log L(λ; Z)

(4)

Y

with Z = (X, Y ). This expression requires to express the complete-data likelihood function which, for an ARPHMM,
is given by:

L(λ; Z) = p(y1; ΠΠΠ)

p(yt|yt−1; A)

t=2

p(xt|yt; r∆(yt), ΣΣΣ(yt))

(cid:89)

t=1

(5)

Using the Theory of Weighted Distributions (WDT) and for any positive weights W, Eq. 4 can be modiﬁed as follows:

Q(λ, λ(q)) = E
λ(q) [log L(λ; z)|x, w]
(cid:80)
y w(y)p(y|x, λ(q)) log L(λ; z)
Eλ[w(y)]

=

(6)

This adaptation of EM for the ARHMM allows one to easily incorporate prior beliefs about the hidden states in a sound
manner since EM still converges thanks to the normalisation.

We can expand the expression of Q, derive the expression with respect to the parameters to get the parameters at
iteration q + 1 of the modiﬁed EM. For the Markov chain, we have:

2.3 ARPHMM for health assessment and prognostics

Health assessment can be performed by inferring the hidden state at the current time t. As in standard HMM, it is made
possible by either a forward or a forward-backward passes or applying the Viterbi algorithm. The speciﬁcity of the
proposed approach is to be able to exploit prior on the latent structure.

The remaining useful life can be estimated by a direct propagation computed, for instance, by a similarity-based
approach. The principle is to look for a training instance in the historical data that is similar to the currently observed
data and to consider that the latter would evolve in the same way [29]. The computation of the similarity is however of
key importance [29, 27].

Likelihood-based approaches does not always generalize well to unobserved (quite different) cases. This could be a
limitation for health assessment and prognostics on real systems. Bayesian approaches have been used for tackling such
problems in PHM, mostly during the prediction phase or for RUL estimation (for instance to update noise characteristics)
and speciﬁcally to integrate prior on models’ parameters [30, 31].

The Theory of Weighted Distributions used in this paper plays a similar role to the Bayesian approach but speciﬁcally on
the latent variables. Its interest holds particularly in the possibility to be used in MLE-based learning which represents a
learning paradigm that is widely used in PHM-related publications. The use of prior on latent variables’ conﬁguration
allows to condition some areas of the feature space which is expected to make those ML-based models more speciﬁc.

Practically, the ARPHMM can be used for health assessment and prognostics as follows:

• Learning for prognostics: Build an ARPHMM by considering the RUL as output in the AR process. Consider
various parameterizations of the prior (w) if the internal states have no meaning. The learning procedure thus
estimates the mapping between the RUL and the data conditioned on the prior.

• Health assessment on testing data: Apply the forward-backward propagations and ﬁnd the most probable state,
or the Viterbi algorithm. If no prior is available during inference, then wt,i = 1. If some prior information are
available, then it can be used in the propagations (Eq. 12b).

• RUL estimation: For the testing phase, ﬁnd the likeliest model by applying the forward pass together with
either the prior used for training (by assuming that the initial wear of both training and testing data are similar)
or an external prior if available. Then deduce the RUL by merging the closest instances.

Note that RUL estimation could also be performed by sampling the underlying state-space model (Eq. 1) which is not
studied in this paper and let for future work.

Illustration on turbofan datasets

3.1 Datasets description

The turbofan datasets were generated using the CMAPSS simulation environment that represents an engine model of
the 90,000 lb thrust class [25, 26]. The authors used a number of editable input parameters to specify operational proﬁle,
closed-loop controllers, environmental conditions. Some efﬁciency parameters were modiﬁed to simulate various
degradations in different sections of the engine system. Selected fault injection parameters were varied to simulate
continuous degradation trends.

The datasets generated possess unique characteristics that make them very useful and suitable for developing classi-
ﬁcation and prognostics algorithms: Multi-dimensional response from a complex non-linear system, high levels of
noise, effects of faults and operational conditions, and plenty of units simulated with high variability. Benchmarking of
prognostics algorithms on those datasets has been proposed and discussed in [32].

Figure 2 (taken from [27]) depicts one of the sensor measurements from a healthy situation to failure, as well as the
evolution of those values in each of the six operating conditions (for instance landing, take-off, cruse and so on).

Figure 3 illustrates the health indicators (computed as suggested [27] and inspired from [33]) for all training data in
each dataset. Dataset #1 is made of 100 training instances with an unique operating condition (OC) and unique fault
mode, dataset #2 with 260 training instances, six OCs and one fault mode, dataset #3 with 100 training instances, one
OC and two fault modes, and dataset #4 with 248 training instances made of six OCs and two fault modes.

In the present paper, the 100 training instances of the turbofan dataset #1 were used for learning and the ﬁrst 15
testing for testing and comparison is made with RULCLIPPER algorithm [27] (available at the following web page:
https://github.com/emmanuelramasso, with the ensemble-approach described in Table 7 of the latter publication). It
is also compared to the Summation Wavelet Extreme Learning Machine (SWELM) algorithm proposed in [34].

3.2 Prior information on the latent variables of the ARPHMM

The ARPHMMs were trained using the health indicators shown in Figure 3a (and available at the aforementionned web
page) as inputs and using the associated RUL as output. The real internal states of the turbofan are unknown but we
insert some prior about some macroscopic latent variables by considering artiﬁcial ﬁnite degradation levels described in
[35] (also available on the web page). Those levels, estimated by this method, are illustrated in Figure 4 for the 100
training data.

The number of states for each training instance was thus equal to the number of states provided by the artiﬁcial
degradation levels (3), and the number of regressors was equal to 7 for all instances (about a quarter of the shorter

to the prior on latent variables which will be performed in future work.

The comparison between the estimated RUL and the ground truth provided at NASA PCOE was made using the
timeliness function as described in [26] and with the mean average percentage error (MAPE) which is possible since
the RULs are available for dataset #1.

(a) Vacuous knowledge (only the instance is provided).

(b) Rough knowledge on states.

Figure 5: Training instance 1, and different qualitative degradation levels used for training.

(c) Detailed knowledge on states.

Results are gathered in Table 1. Compared to RULCLIPPER, which provided the best results on dataset #1 with few
parameters [32], the ARPHMM provides quite similar results in term of MAPE but less in term of timeliness. This
result is encouraging since no optimization was performed for the number of states nor the number of regressors. The
accuracy is around 80% when considering the interval [−13, 10] around the ground truth with a false positive rate
around 67% corresponding to early predictions.

ARPHMM provides better results on average compared to SWELM on those samples. However, one can observe that
the fusion of elements using a simple average of RUL estimates allows to get better results than RULCLIPPER for
those particular 15 instances.

The comparison can not be generalized when compared to RULCLIPPER since it has demonstrated robustness with
few parameters on all turbofan datasets (with OC and two fault modes) using full testing datasets as well as on the
PHM data challenge. However, the results go in favor of developing ensemble approaches made of complementary and
advanced prognostics algorithms. This is all the more true than algorithms’ parameterizations play an important role on
the robustness which may be criticial for in-service use.

3.3 Behavior of the proposed model

Figure 5 illustrates the use of different hidden structure for learning the evolution of the ﬁrst training instance in the
dataset: K=3 states without (Fig. 5a) and with prior (Fig. 5b), and K=10 states (Fig. 5c). The training instance and the
states are then used to learn one model, which is applied on the fourth training instance of the dataset (used as a testing
instance).

Figure 6 is the application of this model for direct RUL estimation at each time step and for the testing instance. It can
be observed that the model seems to provide better results on this new instance when more states are added.

Finally, Figure 7 illustrates the impact of the quality of the prior. This case may correspond to a situation where new but
partial knowledge is available and has to be integrated during prognostics (for instance information on the operating
conditions). The quality is varied using a random sampling of the uncertainty on states as proposed in [17] (code
available at the aforementionned web page). The sampling process is governed by a parameter ρ ∈ [0, 1] such that
ρ = 0 corresponds to the supervised (full quality) case, ρ = 1 to the unsupervised case (no prior), and intermediary
values correspond to noisy prior, all the more noisy than ρ increases.

Figure 6: RUL estimation with different conﬁgurations on the hidden structure.

It can be observed that for K = 3, the RUL estimation is highly dependent on the prior. Besides, the uncertainty can be
quantiﬁed with different values of ρ. Uncertainty is much higher is the elbow part of the degradation, while it is quite
low for the beginning (since all data have similar evolution) and for the end (when converging to the solution). For
K = 10, the RUL estimation is more accurate and does not depend on the prior.

(a) K=3.

(b) K=10.

Those ﬁgures also remind prognostics approaches based on multi-modelling such as [36] and [37]. As for multimodels,
the hidden structure in an ARPHMM allows to evaluate the active feature space, while, for each state, the evolution of
the time-series is approximated. However, in addition to quantifying the uncertainty on states for each new measurement,
the ARPHMM additionally quantiﬁes the likelihood associated to a model which makes model selection possible.

4 Conclusion and perspectives

In this paper, we investigate the use of uncertain prior on the latent structure of dynamic Bayesian network for
prognostics, and in particular an autoregressive partially hidden Markov model. More experiments are needed to
validate the approach but results obtained on some instances of CMAPSS datasets are encouraging when compared to
other approaches from the literature. This model is being improved to include uncertain future operating conditions on
the latent structure.
