Double Coronal X-ray and Microwave Sources Associated With A
Magnetic Breakout Solar Eruption

ABSTRACT

Double coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources are believed to be critical obser-
vational evidence of bi-directional energy release through magnetic reconnection
in a large-scale current sheet in solar ﬂares. Here we present a study on dou-
ble coronal sources observed in both HXR and microwave regimes, revealing
new characteristics distinct from earlier reports. This event is associated with a
footpoint-occulted X1.3-class ﬂare (25 April 2014, starting at 00:17 UT) and a
coronal mass ejection that are likely triggered by the magnetic breakout process,
with the lower source extending upward from the top of the partially-occulted
ﬂare loops and the upper source co-incident with rapidly squeezing-in side lobes
(at a speed of ∼250 km s−1 on both sides). The upper source can be identiﬁed at
energies as high as 70-100 keV. The X-ray upper source is characterized by ﬂux
curves diﬀerent from the lower source, a weak energy dependence of projected
centroid altitude above 20 keV, a shorter duration and a HXR photon spectrum
slightly-harder than those of the lower source. In addition, the microwave emis-
sion at 34 GHz also exhibits a similar double source structure and the microwave
spectra at both sources are in line with gyro-synchrotron emission given by non-
thermal energetic electrons. These observations, especially the co-incidence of
the very-fast squeezing-in motion of side lobes and the upper source, indicate
that the upper source is associated with (possibly caused by) this fast motion of
arcades. This sheds new lights on the origin of the corona double-source structure
observed in both HXRs and microwaves.

Introduction

During solar ﬂares, a signiﬁcant amount of magnetic energy is released to accelerate
electrons (and other particles) through magnetic reconnection in the corona. The accelerated
electrons stream down and bombard the lower chromospheric atmosphere to emit hard X-
rays (HXRs), as imaged by instruments such as the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002), while the intrinsic acceleration site in the corona remains
much more diﬃcult to detect due to its relatively faint emissivity and the limited dynamic
range of the instrument (see the reviews by Krucker et al. 2008, Fletcher et al. 2011, White
et al. 2011). Despite these limitations, major steps toward a full understanding of coronal
sources have been achieved.

Masuda et al. (1994) discovered with the Yohkoh satellite a HXR coronal source at
energy level of 33−53 keV, located above the soft X-rays (SXRs) loop top source. This and
followup studies (e.g., Tomczak 2001; Petrosian et al. 2002) found that the coronal X-ray
sources at higher energies appear at higher altitudes. This has been interpreted with the
standard picture of solar ﬂares (e.g., Priest & Forbes 2002), in which higher ﬂare loops are
ﬁlled with newly reconnected and heated plasmas and energetic electrons of harder spectra,
while lower loops are cooler of previously heated plasmas with energetic electrons of softer
spectra. The Masuda-type above-the-SXR-loop-top HXR source (or simply referred to as
the above-the-loop-top source) is regarded as the extreme of this trend (see, e.g., Liu et al.
2013).

Sui & Holman (2003) discovered a second HXR coronal source lying above the loop-
top source. The combination of the two coronal sources, when present simultaneously, are
referred to as the double-source structure. They and a series of following studies (e.g., Sui
et al. 2004; Veronig et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2008; 2013; Chen & Petrosian 2012) found some
peculiar characteristics of this structure, such as energy-dependent centroid locations with
the sources getting closer at higher energies (or temperatures), similar temporal variations
of HXR ﬂuxes, and close energy spectral indices of the two sources. These observations have
been taken as major evidence supporting the existence of a reconnecting current sheet (lying
in between the two sources) that acts as the expected bidirectional energy release site of
solar ﬂares.

It should be noted that clear observational examples of double coronal X-ray sources
are rare and usually require limb occultation of bright footpoint sources, due to the relative
faintness of coronal sources and the limited dynamic range of present HXR imaging instru-
ments. These occulted events provide a major source of our knowledge on coronal sources
(see the review on this topic by Krucker et al., 2008).

Solar ﬂares are closely related to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). One leading theory
of the CME initiation is the so-called magnetic breakout (Antiochos et al. 1999, Antiochos
1998), through which the coronal conﬁnement restraining the eruption can be released via
the breakout reconnection occurring high in the corona, within a multi-polar magnetic con-
ﬁguration. The breakout reconnection sets in between two sets of constraining ﬁeld lines,
including the large-scale overlying ﬁeld lines of the coronal background and the lower arcade
of loops that is immediately above the energized core ﬂux system. The core ﬂux consists
of a set of sheared or twisted ﬁeld lines, representative of the magnetic driver or energy
source of the eruption. The breakout process can be separated into four evolutionary stages
according to previous numerical simulations (e.g., Lynch et al. 2004, 2008, 2009; MacNeice
et al. 2004; Devore & Antiochos 2008; Karpen et al. 2012): the initial energy storage process
occurring within the central core ﬂux, the breakout reconnection process as just elaborated,
the impulsive eruption process during which the ﬂare starts impulsively and the core ﬂux
takes oﬀ and expands outward while pushing aside nearby side lobes, and the restoration
stage which involves the so-called anti-breakout reconnection in the aftermath of the CME
evacuation (e.g., Lynch et al., 2008). The anti-breakout reconnection sets in between side
lobes to restore the pre-eruption magnetic breakout conﬁguration, after the central arcade
is restored through the primary ﬂaring reconnection.

Observational tests of the breakout model have been published by many authors (e.g.,
Aulanier et al. 2000; Gary & Moore 2004; Harra et al. 2005; Mandrini et al. 2006; Aurass
et al 2011, 2013; Shen et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2013). Most studies focus on disk events
so as to examine the magnetic conﬁguration. Chen et al. (2016) present a breakout event
observed from a novel limb perspective (on April 25 2014, the same event investigated here),
revealing many features analogous to simulations. In their study, the presence of breakout
reconnection is supported by the overall remarkably-analogous-to-simulation conﬁguration
as viewed from the hot passbands (131 and 94 ˚A) of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012). New clues are also found, such as the presence of heated and slowly-evolving X-shaped
morphology with pairs of cusp-like structures, the sequential brightening of loops around this
X feature, among other details.

Of particular interest here is the presence of double coronal HXR sources during the
impulsive stage of the event. The double sources exhibit as the simultaneous presence of
two coronal sources, one lower and one upper, in X-ray images from RHESSI. The lower
source is a typical one that is immediately above the partially-occulted ﬂaring loops while
the upper source is co-incident with the re-approaching side lobes upon the rapid evacua-
tion of the ejecta. Note that the pre-eruption breakout reconnection is not accompanied
by any considerable enhancement of X-ray and microwave emission, indicating insuﬃcient

– 4 –

energetic electrons accelerated during that earlier process. The upper X-ray source, of major
interest here, is observed during the impulsive stage above the site of the earlier breakout
reconnection. Chen et al. (2016) presented a preliminary analysis and found that the upper
source reaches an energy level of 70-100 keV. To further explore its nature, in this study we
examine the spatially-resolved X-ray imaging spectra, the energy dependence of the source
centroid separation, ﬂux variation, as well as the simultaneous microwave sources recorded
by the Nobeyama Radioheliogram (NoRH; Nakajima et al. 1994; Takano et al. 1997) at 17
and 34 GHz.

2. Event Overview

The complete evolutionary process of the breakout event has been described in Chen et
al. (2016). The event was originated from NOAA AR 12035 on the backside of the Sun (the
southwestern quadrant) with the accompanying ﬂare starting at 00:17 UT on 25 April 2014.
The eruption is observed by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser
et al. 2008) B also as a backside event and STEREO-A as a disk event on the southeastern
quadrant, with a 5-minute cadence at 195 ˚A and a 10-minute cadence at 304 ˚A. According to
STEREO-A, the center of the ﬂare ribbons is located at S20E60, ∼7◦ behind the limb from
the SDO-Earth perspective, corresponding to an occultation height of ∼5 Mm (7”). Thus,
a signiﬁcant part of the ﬂare emission is occulted by the limb. This is why we can observe
the faint coronal emission with RHESSI in spite of its limited dynamic range. Note that
the STEREO images are largely saturated with large bright regions over the AR during the
impulsive stage of the X-1.3 ﬂare of study. Thus, although these data are valuable at inferring
the overall morphology of the eruption from diﬀerent perspectives, like the occultation height
as described above, they are not helpful to our study on the origin of HXR emission that
lasts only a few minutes.

In Figure 1, we show the AIA images in its hot passbands of 131 and 94 ˚A during the
impulsive stage. According to Chen et al. (2016), the pre-impulsive stage of the event is char-
acterized by an at-least 40-minute-long breakout reconnection process occurring across an
X-shape structure at a height of 70” above the solar limb. The subsequent outward eruption
of the core ﬂux (black arrow) transforms the reconnecting structure into an extended-curved
transverse structure of a high temperature (yellow arrows), presumably a current sheet. Dur-
ing this impulsive stage, the two side lobes (red arrows) are pushed aside. Around 00:20 UT
when the bright CME core rises to a height of 50”, the side lobes start to move towards each
other. This forms a spearhead-like morphology in the distance-time maps along the three
slices (S1-S3, see Figure 1c) that capture the dynamics of the lobe-approaching region. The

– 5 –

speeds of the loop at the upper side along the slices vary from 220-270 km s−1, comparable
with those measured at the lower side. This gives an approaching (or squeezing-in) speed of
loops about twice the above value.

Note that approaching coronal structures during a solar ﬂare are frequently observed.
Measurements of their speeds have been used to infer the reconnection inﬂow speed. For
example, Lin et al. (2005) deduced that the average reconnection inﬂow velocities near the
presumed current sheet over diﬀerent time intervals ranged from 10.5 to 106 km s−1, Hara
et al. (2011) deduced a ﬂow into the presumed reconnection region (the loop
top) with a Doppler velocity of 20 km s−1, and Su et al. (2013) obtained apparent
inﬂow velocities of ∼50 km s−1 from the south and ∼20 km s−1 from the north side of the
reconnection site. These values are considerably less than those measured here. This rapid
squeezing-in motion even results in an inverted-pear like shape of the rear of the ejecta and a
second clear X-shaped structure high in the corona (∼40”−50” above the limb). This newly-
formed X-shaped structure, considerably lower than the earlier X structure of the pre-ﬂare
triggering breakout reconnection, is coincident and co-spatial with the upper HXR coronal
source (the focus of this study).

3. HXR and microwave data analysis on the breakout double-source event

The new X-shape morphology and rapid squeezing-in motion are observed during the
impulsive stage, lasting for ∼2 minutes. After 00:22 UT, both features disappear from
the AIA images. During this 2-minute interval, RHESSI recorded a HXR double-source
structure. Before examining the spatially-resolved HXR images, we ﬁrst check the integrated
light curves at diﬀerent energy bands as shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the 6-12 and
12-25 keV curves rise gradually from the start of the plot (00:18 UT), basically following the
rising trend of the two GOES SXR curves, while inconsistent with their derivatives. This
suggests that these low-energy ﬂuxes are dominated by thermal emission. On the other hand,
the high energy curves (25-50 and 50-100 keV) present impulsive increases just before 00:20
UT, neither following the GOES curves nor their derivatives. This fact, being inconsistent
with the well-known Neupert eﬀect (Neupert 1968), may be attributed to the occultation
of the footpoint HXR emissions that are the cause of heating the SXR-emitting ﬂare loops,
while here the coronal HXR sources have no contribution to the earlier rising SXR emission.
Note that the above phenomenon is also reported by Eﬀenberger et al.
(2016) in their
independent study of the same event.

In Figure 1a, we overplotted the ﬂux contours of the spatially-resolved HXR data. We
see that, as brieﬂy discussed by Chen et al. (2016), the upper source reaches an energy level

– 6 –

of 70-100 keV, and the lower sources concentrate around 10” above the limb, while the upper
sources are around 50”. The two sources are spatially separated by ∼40”. The lower source
extends upward from the ﬂare loop top, and the upper source is co-spatial with the above-
described X morphology. As seen from Figure 3, before 00:21:24 UT, the centroid distances
of the lower source increase in general with increasing energy (below 50 keV). At higher
energy (50-100 keV), the lower source (00:20:12 − 00:21:16 UT) descends considerably. For
the upper source, the energy dependence of the source centroids is not signiﬁcant below 20
keV, while above 20 keV the upper source presents a weak ﬁrst-rising-then-descending trend
with increasing energy. Note that these distance measurements suﬀer from projection eﬀects.
The inferred energy dependence may be diﬀerent if observed from a diﬀerent perspective.

In Figure 4a-4b we plot the light curves within energy bands of 12-25, 25-50, and 50-100
keV for both sources. The areas used for the plots are drawn in Figure 5a (see circles 1
and 2, and the circles 3 and 4 represent the areas used to calculate the background X-ray
ﬂuxes). We see that the lower-source 12-25 keV curve start to increase around 00:19 UT,
nearly 1 minute earlier than those of the upper source, the 25-50 and 50-100 keV curves
of both sources rise almost simultaneously. Two minutes later the upper source declines
rapidly while the lower source continues to be at a relatively high level. This indicates that
the upper source is more transient. We highlight that the presence of the upper source at
25-50 and 50-100 keV bands is co-temporal and co-spatial with the side-lobe squeezing-in
motion observed from 00:20-00:22 UT (see Figure 1c).

In the centroid distance plot of Figure 3, we integrate the 1-minute RHESSI data to
get enough photon counts within relatively ﬁne energy bands. To investigate the temporal
behavior of the double sources, we consider a shorter interval (20 s) of integration yet using
wider energy bands as a tradeoﬀ. The results are shown in Figure 4c. We see that the lower
sources are around 5-15” at 00:21 UT with the 50-100 keV source being higher untill 00:22
UT. After 00:22 UT, the lower sources manifest a slow rising trend reaching ∼10-20” at 00:25
UT. For the upper source the centroid altitudes at higher energy tend to be slightly higher
initially, at the following two intervals the centroid altitudes present a converging trend at
∼50” above the solar limb.

Note that we tried three methods, including the PIXON (Metcalf et al. 1996), CLEAN
(Hurford et al. 2002), and VIS FWDFIT (Forward-ﬁt algorithm based on visibilities) al-
gorithms (available in the RHESSI software) to reconstruct RHESSI images, and found
consistent results (see Aschwanden et al. (2004) for a comparative study with diﬀerent al-
gorithms). For the above source centroid measurements, we mainly use PIXON, while doing
imaging spectroscopy we use the three methods for a consistency check.

As seen from Figure 5, the obtained three sets of spectral ﬁts, each consisting of a

– 7 –

thermal and a broken power-law component (the spectral index of the pre-break lower-
energy part is taken to be −2), present a spectral index (post-break) of the upper source
slightly smaller by ∼0.5 than that of the lower source. This hardening trend can be clearly
seen from the reconstructed photon spectral data from various methods. Both sources are
power-law dominated above ∼15 keV. The residuals (blue for the upper and red for the
lower source) ﬂuctuate around zero with an amplitude of ∼2σ. The CLEAN method yields
in-general smaller residuals (< 1σ above 10 keV) than the other two methods. Since we are
mainly concerned with the relatively harder spectra of the upper source above 20 keV, the
residuals of the spectral ﬁts are in an acceptable range.

The event is also observed by the NoRH at 17 and 34 GHz with synthesized images and
the Nobeyama RadioPolarimeter (NoRP; Torii et al. 1979) from 1-35 GHz with integrated
ﬂux densities. The TB contours at the two frequencies have been overplotted onto the 94 ˚A
images in Figure 1b, from which we see that the 34 GHz contours present a well-deﬁned
double source structure that is largely coincident with the double HXR sources, while the
17 GHz data show an elongated feature possibly due to the coarser angular resolution (∼10”
at 17 GHz versus ∼5” at 35 GHz).

The evolutionary sequence of NoRH sources is shown in Figure 6 with an accompanying
movie. Note that the NoRH microwave data presented here have a much higher temporal
resolution (1s) than the HXR imaging. This allows more source information to be revealed.
Initially at ∼00:20 UT, only weak emissions (TB ≤ 105 K) are observed. The 17 GHz loop-
top source increases its TB rapidly to a level of 107 K within 40s. Then, the 34 GHz loop-top
source also increases to the same level of TB, while in the upper source region the TBs at
both frequencies are much lower (< 106 K). In general, the 17 GHz source is brighter than
its 34 GHz counterpart. After 00:20:30 UT, the 34 GHz loop-top source starts to present
an extended structure. ∼10 s later, an isolated source appears above the 34 GHz loop-top
source, most evident around 00:21 UT. The isolated source fades away after 00:21:30 UT.
Later, both 34-17 GHz sources maintain a bright localized loop-top source. Through this
process, the 17 GHz loop-top source shows corresponding elongation towards the 34 GHz
upper source, yet without an isolated upper source structure.

In Figure 4d, we have plotted the TB proﬁles averaged within the areas selected for the
17-34 GHz sources (see Figure 6, white curves). The microwave proﬁles are consistent with
their HXR counterparts (25-50 and 50-100 keV), especially during the rising phase. After
the impulsive rise, the lower sources present a double-hump feature. This is diﬀerent from
the upper source that declines rapidly to the pre-eruption level in ∼2 minutes.

To determine the nature of the microwave emission and its connection to the HXR
emission, we examine the deduced microwave spectra. The spatially-unresolved NoRP data

– 8 –

can be used to measure the peak (or turn-over) frequency of the total spectrum (see Figure
7a), which is important to determine the optical thickness of NoRH sources. We see that
the turn-over frequency during this period is always < 10 GHz. This turn-over frequency is
mainly relevant to the loop top source due to its dominance of emission. Considering that
the upper source is located much higher in the corona with a general weaker magnetic ﬁeld
strength, it is expected that the turn-over frequency of the upper source is even lower (Dulk,
1985). This indicates that the 17-34 GHz data reported here are optically-thin.

The NoRH TB spectral index (α) map can be deduced with the measured Tbs at 17-
34 GHz (see Figure 6 and the online movie). Values of α along the line S4 (shown in Figure 6c)
are presented in Figure 7b. We see that during the presence of the upper source, α decreases
to a value ranging from −3 to −4, a typical index for optically-thin gyro-synchrotron emission
(e.g., Dulk et al. 1985; White et al. 2011; Narukage et al. 2014), from ∼2 for the lower
source and from ∼0 for the upper source. This indicates that emissions from both sources
include a signiﬁcant non-thermal contribution.

The upper HXR source reported here is likely attributed to thin-target bremsstrahlung
emission since coronal plasmas are much less dense than chromospheric plasmas of the thick-
target footpoint sources (see Krucker et al., 2008, 2010, 2014 for relevant discussions). We
then infer the electron energy spectral index (δ) using the thin-target approximation with
δ = γ − 0.5 (Brown 1971; Lin 1974; White et al. 2011), and get δ = 3.6-3.8 (∼3.1-3.3)
for the lower (upper) source with the three methods. On the other hand, with the non-
thermal optically-thin gyro-synchrotron mechanism for the microwave upper source with the
TB spectral index α ∼ −3.5, we deduce the electron energy spectra to be ∼3 using the Dulk
approximation (Dulk 1985). The obtained HXR and microwave energy spectral indices of
electrons for the upper source are close to each other indicating that both the HXR and
microwave upper sources are generated by the same population of energetic electrons. Note
that the above analysis of the electron energy spectra is preliminary and model-dependent.

The above discussion on HXR and microwave emission mechanisms helps in understand-
ing why the 34 GHz upper source has a brightness temperature (∼ 105 − 106 K) much lower
than that of the lower source, and why the 34 GHz appears to be displaced (by ∼ 10′′) away
from the source centroid of the counterpart HXR source (see Figure 6). These observations
may be due to the very diﬀerent dependence of HXR and microwave radiation on coronal
parameters. The bremstrahlung HXR emissivity is highly dependent on the electron number
density while the gyro-synchrotron microwave emission is proportional to a high power of
(thus very sensitive to the change of) the magnetic ﬁeld strength (e.g., Dulk 1985).

To summarize this section, we ﬁnd that (1) the double sources, observed in both the
HXR and microwave (34 GHz) regimes, are co-incident with the rapid re-approaching motion

– 9 –

of side lobes and the presence of the resultant X-shape morphology; (2) the projected centroid
distances of the upper source present a weak energy dependence above 20 keV; (3) the upper
source is more transient lasting for 1-2 minutes while the lower source is much longer in
duration, and their ﬂux curves follow the almost-simultaneous rising trend while the upper-
source curve declines much sooner; (4) the HXR upper source presents a spectrum with the
power-law spectral index being slightly harder (by ∼0.5) than that of the lower source, while
in microwaves both sources present a typical non-thermal gyro-synchrotron emission with Tb
spectral index ranging from −3 to −4.

4. Summary and discussion

We investigated the ﬂux and spectral characteristics of a coronal double source structure
observed in X-rays and microwaves during a foot-point occulted X-1.3 ﬂare. The event has
been regarded as a clear example of magnetic breakout observed from a limb perspective,
during which the breakout reconnection high in the corona removes the magnetic conﬁnement
of overlying arcades on the lower energized central core ﬂux and paves the way for the
eruption. The double sources, observed in HXRs by RHESSI and at 34 GHz by NoRH,
appear during the impulsive stage of the event when the ejecta moves outward to a certain
height and the side lobes that were previously pushed aside now start to move towards each
other (or squeeze-in) at a very fast pace (∼220-270 km s−1 on one side). We suggest that
this fast approaching motion of magnetic loops plays an important role in generating the
upper HXR and microwave coronal source.

The approaching motion of side lobes can eﬀectively squeeze the ﬁeld lines on the two
sides of the tail of the ejecta along which the presumed vertical current sheet is located.
This results in “additional” inward pressure that may have signiﬁcantly enhanced the rate of
reconnection (driven by the very-fast inﬂows) and thus the electron acceleration at the wake
of the ejecta. In addition, pre-accelerated electrons (released by the on-going ﬂare process)
may be present as seed particles available for further acceleration around the upper source.
This presents a fast squeezing-in picture for the origin of the localised upper coronal source,
and explains why the upper source is ∼ 40′′ away from the lower source (among events with
the largest double-source separation distance ever reported) with a power-law spectral index
harder (by ∼0.5) than that of the lower source.

In this scenario, the upper source is associated with the squeezing-in motion of the side
It is not necessarily located at the upper tip of the reconnecting current sheet
arcades.
and related to the bidirectional energy release of reconnection across the large-scale current
sheet, as usually assumed (e.g., Sui & Holman 2003; Sui et al., 2004). In addition, earlier

– 10 –

studies found puzzling that the upper coronal source can remain stationary in location for
a few minutes before it vanishes or moves outwards. Sui et al. (2004) tentatively attributed
this observation to the formation and development of the current sheet during the early
impulsive stage of the eruption, yet no further support was provided. In our scenario, the
upper source depends on the rapid approaching motion of side lobes. The motion occurs
within a relatively localized area, so does the resultant upper source.

Note that the essential element of the above scenario, i.e., the squeezing-in motion
of arcades along the tail of the ejecta, may take place as long as the eruption originates
from a multi-polar conﬁguration, where surrounding arcades are ﬁrst pushed aside by the
ejecta and then bounce backwards rapidly. This may result in enhanced pressure towards
the tail of the ejecta (likely with a developing current sheet) and eﬃcient reconnection and
electron acceleration therein, regardless of the exact triggering process of the eruption (being
a magnetic breakout or not). Thus, the proposed scenario for the upper source is mainly
related to the global magnetic conﬁguration rather than the exact triggering mechanism.
Further studies are required to see whether more events are in line with this scenario.

According to numerical simulations of magnetic breakout (Lynch et al., 2008), anti-
breakout reconnection of side lobes sets in after central arcade is completely recovered
through the primary ﬂaring reconnection. From the AIA data, during the impulsive stage
(from 00:20-00:22 UT) coronal structures between the approaching side lobes brighten dif-
fusively (see the online move provided in Chen et al. 2016). This makes it not possible
to separate the anti-breakout reconnection from the primary ﬂaring reconnection with the
observations available here. We tentatively suggest that both may have contributed to the
generation of the upper HXR source.

For the pre-eruption breakout reconnection (i.e., the triggering process), we did not ob-
serve any X-ray and radio signatures of eﬃcient particle acceleration. This is consistent with
the deduction that the triggering breakout reconnection mainly converts magnetic energy
into plasma thermal energy (Chen et al. 2016). During the impulsive stage, the pre-ﬂare X
structure across which the triggering breakout reconnection takes place deforms into a large-
scale transversely-curved thin structure with a high temperature (see the yellow arrows in
Figure 1). The structure has been suggested to be a transverse current sheet straddling the
ejecta (see Chen et al. 2016). During its outward expansion, the structure keeps its shape
and does not manifest some usual reconnection-induced behavior, such as the presence of
magnetic islands, strong bidirectional ﬂows, or some kind of morphology collapse, nor are
there any co-spatial X-ray or microwave sources. This indicates that the structure does not
experience fast reconnection and particles there are not eﬃciently accelerated.

Aurass et al.

(2013) presented an observational report on metric radio evidence of

– 11 –

breakout reconnection during the impulsive stage of the ﬂare occurring on 2003 November
3, on the basis of X-ray and radio-metric imaging and spectral data. Although their study
was conducted in the SOHO era with less dynamical details and temperature coverage, the
two studies together show that various reconnection processes associated with the breakout
eruption can produce radio signatures at both microwave (at higher frequency and thus lower
altitude) and metric (at lower frequency and thus higher altitude) wavelengths.

In an independent study, Eﬀenberger et al. (2016) investigated HXR emission of the
same event using the RHESSI data. They also performed an imaging spectroscopy study of
the double HXR sources and found that the upper source has a slightly harder power-law
spectral index. This allows them to speculate that there exists eﬀective electron acceleration
in that part of the loop (co-spatial with the upper source). This is consistent with our result
although the two studies have selected diﬀerent time intervals of RHESSI data, diﬀerent
regions for the imaging spectroscopy, and diﬀerent ﬁtting methods.

Double coronal sources associated with approaching loops were reported earlier during
the impulsive phase of a C2.3 conﬁned ﬂare (Su et al. 2013). In their event, clear reconnection
signatures of inﬂowing cool loops (at a speed of 20 (50) km s−1 on the south (north) side)
and newly formed, out-ﬂowing hot loops are observed. The X-ray energy of those coronal
sources hardly reaches up to 20 keV, and the X-ray spectra can be well ﬁtted with two
isothermal components. This indicates that their coronal sources are likely thermal in nature.
Here, our event is associated with a major X-class ﬂare and a fast CME, the X-ray energy
in both coronal sources reach up to 70 - 100 keV indicating the presence of nonthermal
energetic electrons. The upper source studied here is also co-incident in time and location
with approaching loops, yet the process is in the aftermath of a successful eruption, and the
approaching speed is ∼5-10 times faster than those reported by Su et al. (2003). In addition,
the side lobes of our event consist of high-temperature plasmas as inferred from the AIA
data. This, again, presents our fast squeezing-in picture (driven by rapidly-approaching side
lobes, with enhanced reconnection rate) for the origin of the upper coronal source.

images, overlaid by (a) RHESSI contours and (b) the 17-34 GHz microwave TB contours,
with levels given by percentages of the maximum HXR ﬂux for corresponding energy band
and the microwave TB maxima. (c) distance-time maps for slices S1-S3 (the starting point is
marked by a short dash). Dashed lines in (c) represent linear ﬁts to estimate velocities, with
errors given by a ∼4 pixel (1.74 Mm) uncertainty of distance measurement. RHESSI images
are reconstructed using the PIXON algorithm and detectors 3, 5, 7-9. The black arrow in (a)
points at the bright ejecta, the yellow and red arrows in (b) point at the expanding current
sheet and the pair of side lobes, respectively.

Fig. 5.— (a) Hard X-ray images given by the PIXON method to indicate the selected areas
used to obtain the X-ray ﬂuxes and imaging spectroscopy for the upper-lower (2-1) sources,
and the corresponding background ﬂuxes (4-3). (b-d) X-ray spectra and spectral ﬁts of the
double sources deduced with the three algorithms within selected areas. The spectral ﬁts are
given by a thermal (dotted) plus a broken power-law (dashed) model. The spectral index
of the lower portion of the power-law component is taken to be −2. Error bars (for the
PIXON- and CLEAN- processed data) are given by the integration of data uncertainties of
each pixel in the region of interest. For PIXON, the 2-D error map is determined with the
RHESSI software (his calc image error.pro); for CLEAN, the RMS of the residual map is
used to represent the uncertainty. For the VIS FWDFIT method, the error bars are given
by 1/3 of the maximal ﬂuxes outside the selected source areas. Residuals of the ﬁt to the
spatially integrated spectra, normalized to the 1σ uncertainty of the measured ﬂux at each
energy band, are shown.
