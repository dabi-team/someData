TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS VIA
DYNKIN DIAGRAM AUTOMORPHISMS: II

SE-JIN OH†, UHI RINN SUH‡

Abstract. As a continuation of the paper [24], we ﬁnd a combinatorial interpretation
of Dorey’s rule for type Cn via twisted Auslander-Reiten quivers (AR-quivers) of type
Dn+1, which are combinatorial AR-quivers related to certain Dynkin diagram automor-
phisms. Combinatorial properties of twisted AR-quivers are useful to understand not only
Dorey’s rule but also other notions in the representation theory of the quantum aﬃne alge-
bra U ′
n ) such as denominator formulas. In addition, unlike twisted adapted classes of
type A2n−1 in [24], we show twisted AR-quivers of type Dn+1 consist of the cluster point
called twisted adapted cluster point. Hence, by introducing new combinatorial objects called
twisted Dynkin quivers of type Dn+1, we give one to one correspondences between twisted
Coxeter elements, twisted adapted classes and twisted AR-quivers.

1. Introduction

In [8], Dorey described relations between three-point couplings in the simply-laced aﬃne
Toda ﬁeld theories (ATFTs) and Lie theories. More precisely, simply-laced ATFTs on un-
twisted aﬃne Lie algebras are related to the same type of Lie algebras and simply-laced
ATFTs on twisted aﬃne Lie algebras are related to non-simply laced Lie algebras obtained
by corresponding Dynkin diagram automorphisms.

Generally, in ATFTs, quantum aﬃne algebras appear as quantum symmetry groups and
the fundamental representations of quantum aﬃne algebras correspond to the quantum par-
ticles in the theories [5]. In particular, the Dorey’s rule was interpreted by Chari-Pressley
[7] in the language of representations of quantum aﬃne algebras. For type An and Dn, they
used representations associated to Coxeter elements and, for type Bn and Cn, they used rep-
resentations associated to twisted Coxeter elements ([25]) of type A2n−1 and Dn+1. Recently,
the ﬁrst author [20, 21] found combinatorial interpretation of Dorey’s rule for type An and
Dn using Auslader-Reiten quivers ([2]) and, in [24], we generalized his work for type Bn using
twisted Auslander-Reiten quivers (AR-quivers). In this paper, we introduce and investigate
twisted AR-quivers of type Dn+1 to ﬁnd a combinatorial statement of Dorey’s rule for type
Cn.

A twisted AR-quiver is in the center of this paper and it is a generalization of an AR-quiver
which gives an answer to Question 1.1. For any given Dynkin quiver Q of ﬁnite type ADEn,
the AR-quiver ΓQ can be understood as a realization of the convex partial order ≺Q on the
set of positive roots Φ+ ([4]): For α, β ∈ Φ+ ,

α ≺Q β ⇔ there is a path from β to α in ΓQ.
The set of all AR-quivers ΓQ has one to one correspondences with the set of convex partial
orders ≺Q, Dynkin quivers Q, Coxeter elements φQ and classes [Q] of reduced expressions of
the longest element w0 ∈ W adapted to Q whose cardinalities are 2n−1. Moreover, the set of
[Q]’s can be grouped into the adapted cluster point [[Q]]; that is

For a Weyl group W of ﬁnite type, a combinatorial AR-quiver Υ[ ew] associated to a class of
w] of w ∈ W was introduced in [23] as a generalization of AR-quiver in
reduced expressions [
the sense that Υ[ ew] is a realization of the partial order ≺[ ew] on Φ(w) = {α ∈ Φ+|w−1α ∈ −Φ+}
(see Remark 2.17 for the deﬁnition of ≺[ ew]).

Since Dorey’s rules for type Cn are described via twisted Coxeter elements of Dn+1, we

reach to the following natural question.

Question 1.1. Is there any non-adapted cluster point which is associated to twisted Coxeter
elements? For the cluster point, can we generalize the correspondences in (1.1)?

Twisted Coxeter elements of type Dn+1 depend on the automorphisms (1.2) and (1.3) of
Dynkin diagrams. In Section 7 and Appendix A, we give an aﬃrmative answer to Question
1.1 for the both types of twisted Coxeter elements associated to (1.2) and (1.3).

In Section 3, we construct a commutation class of reduced expressions [

{Υ[Q←]}

Here, Υ[Q←] is a twisted AR-quiver equipped with a coordinate system. Remark that

for the twisted adapted classes of A2n−1 type, (1.4) is not true.

Another goal of this paper is answering to the following question.

Question 1.2. Is there a combinatorial way to ﬁnd labels of twisted AR-quiver Υ[Q←]?

In [20, 21], the ﬁrst named author showed a purely combinatorial way to ﬁnd labels of ΓQ
in Φ+. Analogous to the adapted cases, in Section 4 and 5, we describe purely combinatorial
ways to ﬁnd labels of Υ[Q←]. In order to do this, we introduce new quivers with coordinate
systems, called folded AR-quivers

Υ[Q←].

An interesting result in Section 4 is that each twisted adapted class [Q←] of Dn+1 is
closely related to the adapted class [Q] where Q is the associated Dynkin quiver of type An.
Υ[Q←] of Dn+1 can be obtained by gluing two copies of AR

On the other hand, in Section 5, we introduce another method to ﬁnd labels of twisted
Υ[Q←] using swings (see Deﬁnition 5.7 for swings.) This result implies a folded
Υ[Q←] of type Dn+1 has similar properties with a full subquiver of Γ[Q] of type

Finally, using the combinatorial properties of folded AR-quivers, we give answers to the

following question.

Question 1.3. Are there applications of twisted and folded AR-quivers to the representation
theory of U ′

Υ[Q←]?

In [22], using the properties of ΓQ discovered in [20, 21], the ﬁrst named author introduced
generalized distances gdist[ ew0] of a sequence of positive root lattice elements, radiuses rds[ ew0]
of roots and socles soc[ ew0] of pairs in Φ+ associated to any [

2. Backgrounds

2.1. Foldable r-cluster point and related reduced expressions. In this subsection,
we recall the deﬁnition of foldable r-cluster points of type ADE and related notions and
properties. For more detail, see [24].

n and nwX

Let In = {1, 2, · · · , n} be the index set of Dynkin diagram ∆X

n of ﬁnite type Xn. Denote
by W X
0 the Weyl group and the longest element. The Weyl group W X
n is generated
by simple reﬂections { si | i ∈ In }. We sometimes omit the type and the rank if there is no
danger of confusion.

For w ∈ W , let i1, i2, · · · , il be indices satisfying w = si1si2 · · · sil. If there is no sequence
j1, j1, · · · , jl′ of indices such that w = sj1sj2 · · · sjl′ and l′ < l then we say l is the length of w
and denote by ℓ(w). The sequences i := i1 i2 · · · il (resp. si1 si2 · · · sil) is a reduced word (resp.
reduced expression) of w. We often abuse the notation i , instead of the reduced expression
si1 si2 · · · sil. Also, note that we denote by i 0 a reduced word of the longest element w0 ∈ W
and by ℓ the length of w0.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let i and j be reduced expressions of w ∈ W . If j can be obtained by
applying commutation relations, sisj = sjsi, to i then we say i and j are commutation
equivalent and denote i ∼ j . The commutation class of i is denoted by [i ].

It can be easily shown that if j ∼ i and i is a reduced expression of w then j is also a
reduced word of w ∈ W . Now, if w = w0, there is another way to ﬁnd reduced expressions
from a given reduced expression i 0 by Proposition 2.2. (See [23], for example.)
Proposition 2.2. Let ∗ : I → I, i 7→ i∗, be the involution induced by w0 on I (See [6]). For a
reduced word i0 = i1 i2 · · · iℓ of w0, two other words i′
ℓ i1 i2 · · · iℓ−1
are also reduced words of w0. Moreover, we have [i0] 6= [i′

0 = i2 i3 · · · iℓi∗
0], [i′′
0].

1 and i′′

0 = i∗

Deﬁnition 2.3. [23] Let i 0 be a reduced expression of w0.
0 ∈ [i 0] (resp. i ′′

(1) If there is a reduced expression i ′

0 ∈ [i 0]) such that i ′

0 = i i2 i3 · · · iℓ

(resp. i ′′

0 = i1 i2 i3 · · · iℓ−1 i) then the index i is called a sink (resp. source) of [i 0].

(2) The right and left reﬂection functors ri for i ∈ I are deﬁned as follows:

[i 0] ri =

(cid:26)

[ i2 i3 · · · iℓ i∗

[i 0]

if i = i1 is a sink of [i 0] and i1 i2 · · · iℓ ∈ [i 0],

if i = il is a source of [i 0] and i1 i2 · · · iℓ ∈ [i 0],
otherwise.

ri [i 0] =

(cid:26)

For a sequence of indices i := j1 j2 · · · jt, we denote by [i 0] ri := [i 0] rj1rj2 · · · rjt and
ri [i 0] := rjtrjt−1 · · · rj1 [i 0].

0] can be obtained by applying reﬂection functors to [i 0] then we say [i 0] and [i ′

0]. The family of commutation classes

are reﬂection equivalent and denote [i 0] r∼ [i ′

(3) If [i ′

[[i 0]] := { [i ′

0] | [i 0] r∼ [i ′

0] }

is called an r-cluster point.

By the deﬁnition of reﬂection functors, we can see that if [i 0] r∼ [i ′

0] for i 0 = i1 i2 · · · iℓ and

for any i ∈ I. Hence we consider the following notion introduced in [24].

Deﬁnition 2.4. [24]

(1) Let ∨ : I → I be an automorphism such that i 7→ i∨. We say ∨ is compatible with

the involution ∗ if i and i∗ are in the same orbit class ¯i determined by ∨.

(2) Let ∨ be an automorphism on I compatible with ∗ and i 0 = i1 i2 · · · iℓ be a reduced
expression of w0. Denote by I = {¯i | i ∈ I } the set of orbits determined by ∨. Then
the ∨-Coxeter composition is

C[i 0] := (C∨

[i 0]( ¯j1), C∨

[i 0]( ¯j2), · · · , C∨

[i 0]( ¯jp)),

p = |I|,

where the smallest representative of ¯jr is less than that of ¯js if and only if r < s and

[i 0](¯k) := | { is | is ∈ ¯k, 1 ≤ s ≤ ℓ } |.
C∨
Due to the compatibility of ∨ in Deﬁnition 2.4, if [i 0] and [i ′

0] are in the same r-cluster
point then they have the same ∨-Coxeter composition. Hence we can denote the ∨-Coxeter
composition associated to [i 0] by C∨

[[i 0]].

Deﬁnition 2.5. [24, Deﬁnition 1.11] For a given automorphism ∨, the r-cluster point [[i 0]]
is said to be ∨-foldable if

[[i 0]]( ¯jr) = C∨
C∨

[[i 0]]( ¯js)

for any ¯jr, ¯js ∈ I.
Convention 2.6. If there is no danger of confusion, we identify the index ¯js in ¯I with s ∈ Z.
Hence the sum (resp. subtraction) ¯js + ¯jr (resp. ¯js − ¯jr) is considered as that in Z so that it
is s + r (resp. s − r) and, similarly, ¯js ± t := s ± t for any t ∈ Z.

In this paper, we deals with ∨-foldable cluster points for ∨ in (1.2). The following remark

shows the ∨-Coxeter composition of such cluster points.

Remark 2.7. Let ∨ be deﬁned in (1.2). If [[i 0]] is ∨-foldable, then

[[i 0]] = (n + 1, . . . , n + 1

(2.2)

Now let us recall another important notion called a twisted Coxeter element (resp. a triply
twisted Coxeter element). Let σ ∈ GL(CΦ) be a linear transformation of ﬁnite order which
preserves the set of simple roots Π ⊂ Φ and consider W σ ⊂ GL(CΦ). Note that the Weyl
group W acts on W σ by conjugations.

Deﬁnition 2.8.
(1) Let Π :=

k
t=1 Πit, where Πit are orbits by the automorphism σ. Take sit ∈ Πit for
t = 1, · · · , k and consider the element w = siτ (1)siτ (2) · · · siτ (k) ∈ W for a permutation
τ ∈ Sk. Then the element wσ ∈ W σ is called a σ-Coxeter element.

F

(2) If σ in (1) is ∨ in (1.2) then σ-Coxeter element is also called a twisted Coxeter element

of type Dn+1.

(3) If σ in (1) is ∨ in (1.3) then σ-Coxeter element is also called a triply twisted Coxeter

element of type D4.

(4) If σ is the identity map, a σ-Coxeter element is called a Coxeter element.

We remark some properties which are useful in the following sections.

Remark 2.9. Note that w in (1) of Deﬁnition 2.8 is fully commutative, i.e. reduced expres-
sions of w consist of the unique commutation class.

Proposition 2.10. [24, Proposition 2.6] The number of twisted Coxeter elements associated
to (1.2) is 2n.

2.2. (Combinatorial) Auslander-Reiten quivers. For type ADE, there are one-to-one
correspondences between the set of commutation classes of adapted reduced expressions of w0,
Dynkin quivers, Coxeter elements and Auslander-Reiten quivers. In this section, we recall
the correspondences and introduce the notion of combinatorial Auslander-Reiten quivers,
which is a generalization of Auslander-Reiten quivers in a combinatorial aspect. Details can
be found in [2, 3, 10, 20, 22, 23].

Let ∆ be a Dynkin diagram of type ADEn and Q be a Dynkin quiver, which is obtained
by assigning direction to every edge in ∆. The set of positive roots is denoted by Φ+ and
Π = {αi | i ∈ I} is the set of simple roots. Gabriel theorem (Theorem 2.11) and the
construction of Auslander-Reiten quiver (Deﬁnition 2.14) shows the relation between quiver
representations and positive roots.

Theorem 2.11 (Gabriel’s theorem). [10] There is the bijection between the set IndQ of
isomorphism classes of ﬁnite dimensional indecomposable modules over the path algebra CQ
and Φ+ which takes a class to the corresponding dimension vector.

Deﬁnition 2.12.

(1) An index i ∈ I is called a sink (resp. source) of Q if there is no

arrow exiting from (resp. entering to) the vertex i.

(2) Denote by siQ or i Q the quiver obtained by reversing every arrow connecting i and

another vertex if i is a sink or a source. Otherwise, we let siQ = i Q = Q.

(3) Let i = i1 i2 · · · iℓ(w) be a reduced expression of w. We say i is adapted to the Dynkin

quiver Q if ik is a sink of ik−1ik−2 · · · i2i1Q for k = 1, · · · , ℓ(w).

For adapted reduced expressions of w0, there are well-known facts which is stated below.

Theorem 2.13.

(1) There is the natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of commutation classes
of adapted reduced expressions of w0 and the set of Dynkin quivers. Hence we denote
by [Q] the class of reduced expressions of w0 which are adapted to the quiver Q.
(2) There exists a unique Coxeter element φQ which is adapted to Q. Conversely, any

Coxeter element is adapted to some Dynkin quiver Q.

Hence there are canonical one-to-one correspondences between rank 2n−1 sets:

(2.3)

{[Q]} o

/ {φQ} o

/ {Q}

Note that there exists a unique cluster point consisting of all adapted classes [Q]. we call it
the adapted cluster point and denote by [[Q]].

Deﬁnition 2.14. For a Dynkin quiver Q of ﬁnite type ADE, let us take a reduced word i 0
in [Q]. The quiver ΓQ = (Γ0
(1) each vertex in Γ0
(2) an arrow [M] → [M ′] in Γ1

Q) is called the Auslander-Reiten quiver (AR-quiver) if

Q corresponds to an isomorphism class [M] in IndQ,

Q represents an irreducible morphism M → M ′.

Q, Γ1

By Gabriel’s theorem, every vertex of an AR-quiver can be labeled by a positive root and
there is a well-known combinatorial construction of an AR-quiver. In order to introduce its
simpler construction and properties, let us consider the subset

Φ(w) := { β ∈ Φ+ | w−1(β) ∈ −Φ+ } = { βi

k | βi

k = si1si2 · · · sik−1(αik ), k = 1, · · · , ℓ(w) }.

Note that |Φ(w)| = ℓ(w) and Φ(w0) = Φ+.

supp(α) := { αk | mk 6= 0, k ∈ I }.

P

i∈I miαi ∈ Φ+, the support of α is

Also, if αk ∈ supp(α) then we say αk is a support of α.

Deﬁnition 2.16. For any γ ∈ Φ+, the multiplicity of γ, denoted by m(γ) is the positive
integer deﬁned as follows:

If m(γ) = 1, we say that γ is multiplicity free.

m(γ) = max{ mi |

Remark 2.17. Let i be a reduced word of w. The total order <i on Φ(w) is deﬁned by

k <i βi
βi

l if and only if k < l.

Then <i is convex, i.e., if α, β, α + β ∈ Φ+ and α <i β then α <i α + β <i β. Using the
convex total orders <i , the convex partial order ≺[i] can be deﬁned as follows:

α ≺[i ] β ⇔ α <i ′ β for any i ′ ∈ [i ].

If i 0 is adapted to Q then we denote ≺[i 0] by ≺Q and ≺Q is closely related to the AR-quiver.

Deﬁnition 2.18. A combinatorial way to construct the AR-quiver ΓQ with a Coxeter element
φQ is given as follows ([12, §2.2]):

(1) Let us denote φQ = si1si2 · · · sin and consider a height function ξ : I → Z satisfying
φQ : Φ(φQ) →

ξ(i) = ξ(j) + 1 if there is an arrow from j to i in Q. Take the injection

then there is an arrow (i, p) → (j, q).

Note that if

φQ(α) = (i, p) for α ∈ Φ+, then we say that i is the residue of α with respect to
φQ(β) = (i, p)

By the following theorem, a combinatorial AR-quiver can be understood as a generalization
of an AR-quiver which proposes the generalization of Proposition 2.20. (See [23].) Also, we
have a simple algorithm to get Υ[i 0] ri from Υ[i 0] for a sink i of [i 0].
Algorithm 2.23.

(A′1) Remove the vertex v0 of Υ[i0] in the i-th residue which does not

have arrows exiting from v0 and remove every arrow entering into v0.

(A′2) Add a vertex v1 in the i∗-th residue and add arrows from v1 to a vertex v such that
(i) v is in the j-th residue for an adjacent vertex j to i∗ in ∆, (ii) v′ ≺[i0] v for any
other vertex v′ in the i∗-th or j-th residue.

(A′3) The label of v1 is αi. For the other vertices, substitute the label α by si(α).

(1) The construction of Υi0 does depend only on its commutation class [i0] and hence Υ[i0]

is well-deﬁned.

(2) α ≺[i0] β if and only if there exists a path from β to α in Υ[i0].
(3) By deﬁning the notion, standard tableaux of shape Υ[i0], every reduced word i′

0 ∈ [i0]
corresponds to a standard tableau of shape Υ[i0] and can be obtained by reading residues
in a way compatible with the tableaux.

(4) When [i0] = [Q], Υ[Q] is isomorphic to ΓQ as quivers.

3. Twisted adapted cluster point of type Dn+1

3.1. Twisted adapted cluster point and twisted Coxeter element. In this section, we
denote by ∆, W and Φ+ the Dynkin diagram, the Weyl group and the set of positive roots
of type Dn+1. Also, we let ∨ be the automorphism in (1.2). By identifying αi = εi − εi+1
(1 ≤ i ≤ n) and αn+1 = εn + εn+1, positive roots in Φ+ can be denoted as follows:
Φ+

Dn+1 = {ha1, −a2i, hb1, b2i, hc, n + 1i |1 ≤ a1 < a2 ≤ n + 1, 1 ≤ b1 < b2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ c ≤ n}

In order to distinguish positive roots of type Dm and Am, we use the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.1.

(1) For ha, bi ∈ Φ+
respectively.

Dm, we denote a and b by the ﬁrst and second summands of α = ha, bi,

(2) For β = [a, b] ∈ Φ+

Am, we denote a and b by the ﬁrst and second components of β,

respectively. If β = αa then we write β as [a].

Consider the twisted Coxeter element (s1s2 · · · sn)∨ of Dn+1. In this subsection, we denote

(3) [[i 0]] is the r-cluster point of i 0.

We can check that i 0 is a reduced expression of w0 by direct computations.

Remark 3.2. By the deﬁnition of ∨, if we denote

p−2

βi 0
p,q =

(s1 s2 · · · sn)k∨(s1s2 · · · sq−1)(p−1)∨(αq(p−1)∨) for p ∈ {1, · · · , n + 1}, q = {1, · · · , n}

Deﬁnition 3.4.

(1) The cluster point [[i 0]] is called the twisted adapted cluster point of type Dn+1.

Proof. Suppose i1 i2 · · · in is a Coxeter element of An. Then both [i1 i2 · · · in]∨ and
[(i1 i2 · · · in)∨]∨ are twisted Coxeter elements of Dn+1. Hence we proved the proposition. (cid:3)

Theorem 3.10.

(1) There is the natural one-to-one correspondence between twisted Coxeter elements and

twisted adapted classes of type Dn+1.

(2) Since the number of adapted classes of type An is 2n−1, the number of classes in the

twisted adapted cluster point of type Dn+1 is 2n.

Remark 3.11. In the twisted adapted cluster point of type A2n+1 [24], there are some classes
which are not associated to twisted Coxeter elements. The number of twisted adapted classes
of type A2n+1 is 22n and the number of twisted Coxeter element of type A2n+1 is 3n−1 · 4.
Hence Theorem 3.10 is a special property for the type Dn+1 case.

4. Twisted and folded AR-quivers and their labeling via AR-quivers of

type An

4.1. AR-quivers of type An. In this subsection, we brieﬂy review the combinatorial prop-
erties of AR-quiver for a Dynkin quiver Q of type An, which were studied in [20].

Deﬁnition 4.1. [20, Deﬁnition 1.6] Fix any class [j 0] of w0 of any ﬁnite type.

(a) A path in Υ[j 0] is N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) if it is a concatenation of upward

arrows (resp. downward arrows).

(b) An N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) path ρ is maximal if there is no longer N-sectional

(resp. S-sectional) path containing ρ.

(c) For a sectional path ρ, the length of ρ is the number of all arrows in ρ.

Proposition 4.2. [23, Proposition 4.5] Fix any class [j0] of w0 of type An. Let ρ be an
N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) path in Υ[j0]. Then every positive roots contained in ρ has the
same ﬁrst (resp. second) component.

Theorem 4.3. [20, Corollary 1.12] Fix any Dynkin quiver Q of type An. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
the AR quiver ΓQ contains a maximal N-sectional path of length n − i once and exactly once
whose vertices share i as the ﬁrst component. At the same time, ΓQ contains a maximal
S-sectional path of length i − 1 once and exactly once whose vertices share i as the second
component.

Thus, for any AR-quiver ΓQ of type An, we say that an N-sectional path ρ is the maximal
N-sectional path of length k (0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1) if all positive roots contained in ρ have n − k as
ﬁrst components. Similarly, we can deﬁne a notion of the maximal S-sectional path of length
k (0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1) whose positive roots contain k + 1 as second components. Note that, in
this paper, we only need maximal sectional paths (see Section 5).

Lemma 4.4. [14, Lemma 3.2.3] For any Dynkin quiver Q of type ADm, the positions of
simple roots inside of ΓQ are on the boundary of ΓQ; that is, either

(i) αi is a sink or a source of ΓQ, or

(ii) residue of αi is

1 or n
1, n or n + 1

(

if Q is of type An,
if Q is of type Dn+1.

Furthermore,

(a) all sinks and sources of ΓQ have their labels as simple roots,
(b) i is a sink (resp. source) of Q if and only if αi is a sink (resp. source) of ΓQ

4.2. Twisted and folded AR-quivers of type Dn+1. In this subsection, we describe a
coordinate to a combinatorial AR-quiver of a twisted adapted class. For the purpose, we
denote by i 0 = Πn

k=0(i1 i2 · · · in)k∨ a reduced expression in a twisted adapted class.

Deﬁnition 4.5. If [i 0] is a twisted adapted class then the combinatorial AR-quiver Υ[i 0] is
called a twisted AR-quiver.

Let us denote the twisted Coxeter element of [i 0] by φ[i 0]∨ = (si1 · · · sin)∨ and

algorithm for the twisted Auslander-Reiten quiver Υ[i 0] with the coordinate system as follows:

Remark 4.7. The above algorithm is well-deﬁned by (3.4) and

for each β ∈ Φ+ and [i 0] of w0, the residue i of β with respect to [i 0] is

In the sense of [24, Section 7], we introduce the folded Auslander-Reiten quiver

Υ[i 0] of a

twisted adapted class [i 0]:

(1) In the folded AR-quiver, we assign folded coordinate (¯i, p, (−1)δi,n+1) ∈ I × Z × {±1}
φ[i 0](β) = (i, p).
(2) There is an arrow from (¯i, p, (−1)δi,n+1) → (¯j, q, (−1)δj,n+1) if and only if there is an

for the positive root β such that

b

arrow (i, p) → (j, q) in Υ[i 0].

e

b

In

Υ[i 0], we often omit the third coordinate and use only the ﬁrst and second coordinates,
(¯i, p). It is not hard to see that the set of coordinates which are assigned to positive roots is
¯I := { (¯i, ξ(¯i) − 2t ) | t = 0, 1, · · · , n }.
(4.2)
Also, there is an arrow (¯i, p) → (¯j, q) for (¯i, p), (¯j, q) ∈ ¯I if and only if there are i ∈ ¯i and
j ∈ ¯j such that |¯i − ¯j| = 1 and q = p + 1. We call i the folded residue of β with respect to [i0]
when β is located at (i, p) in

Υ[i 0].

Proof. Note that if jt1 = n (resp. jt1 = n+1), then jt = n+1 (resp. jt = n). By Theorem 2.24
and Remark 4.10, the assertion comes from the compatible readings of (i) j 0 inside of 1ΓQ
ﬁrst, and then (ii) 1ΓQ \j 0 inside of 1ΓQ. Here, all vertices in the n-th and the n+1-th-resides
(cid:3)
have to be read as n.

Remark 4.12. In the above proposition, we can assume that j 0 is a reduced expression in
[i 0] with the largest t without any loss of generality. By Theorem 2.24 and Theorem 4.3,
such j 0 can be obtained by the following way:

(4.3)

(i) Read the residues of all vertices in the right part of the length n−1 S-sectional
path ρ inside 1ΓQ. (ii) Read residues on the path ρ. (iii) Read the remained.

(See the labeled vertices in (4.4).) We denote by ΥR
vertices in (i) and (ii) in (4.3)

[i 0] the full subquiver consisting of the

Corollary 4.13. Let i0, j0, Q and t be in Proposition 4.11 and jt1 = n (resp. jt1 = n+1). The
subquiver ΥR

Moreover, labels in ΥR
Q. Precisely, correspondences between
Q and ΥR
the labels of ΓR

[i0] direct follow from those in ΓR
[i0] are as follows:

(cid:26)

hi, −j − 1i
hi, −n − 1i (resp. hi, n + 1i)

if i, j 6= n
if j = n.

Proof. If jt1 = n, our assertion directly follows from Proposition 4.11. If jt1 = n + 1, our
(cid:3)
assertion can be obtained by swapping the roles of αn and αn+1.

Remark 4.15. By taking reﬂection with respect to x-axis to 2ΓQ∗, one can easily check that
2ΓQ∗ is isomorphic to ΓQ as quivers. Then the S-sectional path (resp. N-sectional path)
in 2ΓQ∗ of length k corresponds to the N-sectional path (resp. S-sectional path) in 1ΓQ of
length k.

Recall that there is an involution ∗ on the index set I D

Since sip(αip) = −αip, we have si1si2 · · · sip(αip) = −βi 0

Proposition 4.16. Let [i0] be a twisted adapted class. For j′
0 = j1j2 · · · jN ∈ [i0], suppose
t1 and t are the largest integer and second largest integers such that jt1, jt ∈ ¯n. Let jt1 = n
(resp. jt1 = n + 1). Consider the Dynkin quiver Q of An satisfying pDn+1
([i0]) = [Q] and
Qrev, the Dynkin quiver which is obtained by reversing every arrow in Q. Then there is a
reduced expression k0 ∈ [Qrev] of An starting with jNjN−1 · · · jt+1 (resp. (jNjN−1 · · · jt+1)∨ ).
Proof. Consider [i ′

Convention 4.25. Now, we ﬁx the height function ξ in Algorithm 4.6 such that
ξ(1) − 2 × aQ

(4.9)

1 + 1 = 0.

Note that the ρ (resp. ρ′) in (4.3) (resp. (4.7)) is the rightmost (resp. leftmost) S-sectional
(resp. N-sectional) path of length n − 1 in Υ[i 0]. Furthermore, by [20, Remark 1.14], (4.9)
implies that

vertices in ρ′ are (1, −1) and ρ starts at (1, 1).

Equivalently, we can say

in

Υ[i 0], vertices in ρ′ are (¯r, −r) and vertices ρ are (¯r, r).

Now, with the above convention, we can summarize the previous results on the labeling

Υ[i 0] in this subsection as follows:

b

Proposition 4.26. For a twisted adapted class [i0], we can label the vertices whose coordi-
nates in

Υ[i0] are

{(¯i, j), (¯i, k) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, j ≤ −i, k ≥ i}
by using the labels of ΓQ. In particular, the set of coordinates of

Φ+|n+1i := {hi, n + 1i , hi, −n − 1i | 1 ≤ i ≤ n }

in

Υ[i0] is {(¯i, −i), (¯i, i) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

Proof. Note the following:

b
(4.11)

In ΓQ, ρ in Remark 4.12 and ρ′ in Remark 4.17 correspond to S-sectional path of
length n − 1 whose second component is n, simultaneously.
Then our assertion follows from Corollary 4.13 and Corollary 4.19.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.27. If the coordinate in
is (n + 1 − i, −n − 1 + i). On the other hand, if the coordinate in
then the coordinate of hj, −n − 1i is (n + 1 − i, n + 1 − i).

Υ[i0] of hj, n + 1i is (¯i, i) then the coordinate of hj, −n − 1i
Υ[i0] of hj, n + 1i is (¯i, −i)

b

Proof. It follows from the fact that if the vertices with coordinates (i, i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are
determined by the ΓQ then the vertices with coordinates (i, −i) 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are also obtained
(cid:3)
by the map (vertices in i-th residue)7→ (vertices in n + 1 − i-th residue) on ΓQ.

b

Deﬁnition 4.28. For any γ ∈ Φ+, the folded multiplicity of γ, denoted by m(γ) is a positive
integer deﬁned as follows:

If m(γ) = 1, we say that γ is folded multiplicity free.

From now on, we shall label the vertices which are not covered by Proposition 4.26. By

the observation (4.11), the number of such vertices is

• each vertex in ΥC
• ΥC

[i 0] is contained in two sectional paths of length n − 1,

[i 0] is surrounded by ρ in Remark 4.12 and ρ′ in Remark 4.17.

Thus, as the set of vertices, we have
Υ[i 0] = ΥL

Proposition 4.30. Let β1 and β2 be positive roots of Φ+|n+1i such that whose twisted coor-
dinates are (i1, −i1) and (i2, i2) for 1 ≤ i1, i2 ≤ n − 1. If i1 + i2 ≤ n then the label with the
coordinate (i1 + i2, −i1 + i2) in

Υ[i0] is β1 + β2.

Proof. Suppose the vertex whose coordinate is (i1 + i2, −i1 + i2) in
Υ[i 0] has a residue less
than n. In order to see the case when the third coordinate of (i1 + i2, −i1 + i2) is 1, let V be
the set of vertices which can be described as follows: V = ∪i1

Vt = {(i2 + t, i2 − t), (i2 + t − 1, i2 − t − 1), · · · , (t, −t)}, for t = 1, · · · , i1.

Hence there is a compatible reading of Υ[i ′

the intersection of ρ′ and the S-sectional path containing v, our assertion follows.

Let us denote by

ν[i 0] : 1ΓQ ⊔ 2ΓQ∗ → Υ[i 0],
the map between the sets of vertices. Recall Remark 4.15 for the isomorphism of quivers
1ΓQ ≃ 2ΓQ∗ ≃ ΓQ.

If we denote the coordinate of hi, −n − 1i and hj, n + 1i in
the coordinate of hi, ji and hj, −n − 1i are (i1 + i2, i1 − i2) and (n + 1 − i2, n + 1 − i2). Then,
by taking proper height function of type An, we have
(a) coordinates of [i, n] and [j, n] in ΓQ are (i1, i1) and (n + 1 − i2, n + 1 − i2),
(b) the root α with the coordinate (i1 + i2, i1 − i2) in ΓQ satisﬁes that α + [j, n] = [i, n], i.e.,

b

α = [i, j − 1].

Here (b) follows by the additive property of AR-quiver. For the remaining cases. we can
(cid:3)
apply the similar arguments.

By summing up results in this section, we get the following algorithm for labeling twisted

and folded AR-quiver of type Dn+1 by using the labels of ΓQ of type An.

Algorithm 4.34. Let Q be the Dynkin quiver of type An such that pDn+1

An

([i0]) = [Q]

(i) Let us consider take 1ΓQ as ΓQ with the labeling Φ+

An and take 2ΓQ∗ by turning 1ΓQ

upside down.

(ii) Put 2ΓQ∗ at the left of 1ΓQ in a canonical way.
(iii) Take ρ the unique S-sectional path of length n − 1 in 1ΓQ and take ρ′ the unique N-
sectional path of length n − 1 in 2ΓQ∗. Then their labels are the same as {[i, n] | 1 ≤
i ≤ n}

(iv) Change all labels right to ρ or left to ρ′ from [a, b] to ha, −b − 1i.
(v) Change the duplicated labels {[i, n] | 1 ≤ i ≤ n} in ρ ⊔ ρ′ as follows:

1ΓQ ∋ [i, n] 7−→

hi, −n − 1i
hi, n + 1i

(

if n appears in φ[i0],
if n + 1 appears in φ[i0],

2ΓQ∗ ∋ [i, n] 7−→

hi, −n − 1i
hi, n + 1i

(

if n + 1 appears in φ[i0],
if n appears in φ[i0].

(vi) Change all labels surrounded by ρ and ρ′ from [a, b] to ha, b + 1i.

The resulting quiver is the folded AR-quiver

Υ[i0].

Remark 4.35. From the above algorithm, one can notice that

b

[i 0] and α ∈ ΥR

(i) for any β ∈ ΥL
(ii) there exists a path from β to α in ΓQ if and only if there exists a path from β′ to α′
in 1ΓQ (resp. 2ΓQ∗), where β′ and α′ correspond to labels β and α obtained from the
algorithm.

[i 0], there exists a path from β to α inside Υ[i 0],

From Algorithm 4.34, we have also an interesting phenomena as follows:

Corollary 4.36. Assume that we have γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π. Then γ is folded multiplicity non-free if
and only if γ is contained in ΥC

[i0].

24

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

Corollary 4.37. Let (¯i, k) be the coordinate of ha, bi in
ha, −bi satisﬁes

Υ[i0]. Then the coordinate (¯j, k′) of

j = n + 1 − i and |k − k′| = n + 1.

b

Υ[i 0] = 1ΓQ ⊔ 2ΓQ∗
Proof. Corollary 4.27 shows it is true when m = 0. Now by the fact that
and Corollary 4.27, we can see that the label of (¯i, j) ∈ 1ΓQ is hk1, k2i then the label of
(cid:3)
(n + 1 − i, n + 1 + j) ∈ 2ΓQ is hk1, −k2i .

Remark 4.39. We have another algorithm to get labels of twisted AR-quivers without using

5. Labeling of a twisted AR-quiver using only its shape

As in the last section, we ﬁx the height function of a folded AR-quiver

Υ[i 0] by letting
hi, ±n + 1i have the coordinate (¯j, ±j). Note that we can naturally deﬁne the notion of the
sectional path for twisted AR-quivers and folded AR-quivers of type Dn. Now we shall extend
the notion of the sectional path for our purpose:
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let us ﬁx m ∈ Z.

b

(1) An N ext

m -sectional quiver is the subquiver of

Υ[i 0] consisting of the following set of

vertices { (i, −i + 2m + 2(n + 1)m′) | 0 ≤ i ≤ n, m′ ∈ Z} ∩

Υ[i 0].

Υ[i 0].

{ (i, i + 2m − (2n + 2)) | 0 ≤ i ≤ n} ∩

Υ[i 0].

ciated to the same m.

(a) N ext

Example 5.2. In Example 4.38, we can observe properties of the notions in Deﬁnition 5.1:
−1 -sectional quiver is union of N−1-sectional path and N4-sectional path which are
disconnected. Here, N−1-sectional path consists of {h1, −2i} and N4-sectional path
consists of {h2, −3i, h2, −4i, h2, 5i}. On the other hand, the N ext
-sectional quiver is
connected and coincides with ρ′ consisting of {h2, −5i, h1, −5i, h3, −5i, h4, −5i}.

(b) Sext

-sectional quiver is union of S2-sectional path and S−3-sectional path which are
disconnected. Here, S2-sectional path consists of {h1, −3i, h2, −3i} and S−3-sectional
path consists of {h3, −5i, h3, 4i}. On the other hand, the Sext
−1 -sectional quiver is con-
nected and coincides with S−1-sectional path consisting of {h2, −5i, h2, 4i, h2, 3i, h1, 2i}.

The sectional paths have the following propositions.

Proposition 5.3.
(1) Each N ext

residues ¯1, ¯2, · · · , ¯n.

m -sectional (resp. Sext

m -sectional) quiver consists of n vertices with distinct

(2) If m1 ≡ m2 (mod n + 1) then N ext

m1 -sectional quiver (resp. Sext

m1 -sectional quiver)

coincides with N ext

m2 -sectional quiver (resp. Sext

m2 -sectional quiver).

(3) If m1 6≡ m2 (mod n + 1) the N ext

m1 -sectional quiver and the Sext

m2 -sectional quiver have

a unique intersection.
(4) For each m, one of the N ext
m -sectional quiver and Sext
m -sectional quiver is connected.
(5) If hk1, k2i is in the Nm-sectional (resp. Sm-sectional) path then hk1, −k2i is in the

m -sectional (resp. N ext
Sext

m -sectional) quiver.

Proof. (1), (2) and (3) are not hard to prove so that we only give a proof of (4) and (5).
By the observations in the previous section, we know that h1, n + 1i and h1, −n − 1i have
coordinates (¯i, ±i) and (¯j, ±j) with i + j = n + 1. Recall the facts in [20, Corollary 1.15]:
(a) In an AR-quiver ΓQ of type An, [1, n] is located at the intersection of the S-sectional

path of length n − 1 and the N-sectional path of length n − 1.

(b) In an AR-quiver ΓQ of type An, there are exactly two sectional path of length n − 1.

b

Since folded AR-quiver

quivers 1ΓQ and 2ΓQ∗ of type An, we conclude that every N ext
m = 0, 1, · · · , i and every Sext
Then our fourth assertion follows from the fact that i + j = n + 1.

Υ[i 0] of Dn+1 can be understood as the disjoint union of AR-
m -sectional path associated to
m -sectional path associated to m = 0, 1, · · · , j is connected.

For (5), recall that (¯i, j) and (n + 1 − i, n + 1 + j) are in the N ext
m -sectional (resp. Sext
m -
sectional) quiver and Sext
m -sectional (resp. N ext
m -sectional) quiver, respectively, for m = (i +
(cid:3)
j)/2 (resp. m = (j − i)/2). By Corollary 4.37, we proved the corollary.
Proposition 5.4. For each m ∈ Z, the m-snake has a positive integer p such that every
vertex in m-snake has a summand p or −p.
Proof. Let us take a connected N ext
N ext
with the label hj, ±(n + 1)i . Recall the two following facts:
(a) vertices in an N-sectional path of An share the ﬁrst component (Theorem 4.3). Thus
Υ[i 0] for i′ < i share j as the ﬁrst summand.

m -sectional quiver associated m 6≡ 0 (mod n+1). Then the
-sectional. Suppose (¯i, i) is the vertex

m -sectional quiver has an intersection with the Sext

(¯i′, 2i − i′) in 1ΓQ ⊂

(b) Proposition 4.30 shows that (¯i′, 2i − i′) for i′ > i has j as its summand.
Hence we proved for the N-sectional path N 1 contained in N ext

vertices in N ext

m share j as their ﬁrst summand.

m -sectional quiver is connected, then all

Now we assume that N ext

m -sectional quiver is not connected. We claim that

m -sectional quiver is not connected (equivalently the length of N 1 is k less than

N ext
n − 1), the connected component N 1 is contained in 1ΓQ.
If N1 is not contained in 1ΓQ, then it contains a vertex in ΥC
[i 0] which yields a contradiction
to the ﬁrst observation in (4.12). By Theorem 4.3 and Algorithm 4.34, the summand j is

TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS: II

27

the same as n − k, in this case. By (1) in Proposition 5.3, the other N-sectional path N 2 of
N ext
m -sectional quiver is of length n − 2 − k. By Theorem 4.3, Remark 4.15 and Algorithm
4.34, every vertex in N 2 has −(n + 1 − k) as it second summand and N 2 is contained in 2ΓQ∗.
Hence we proved our assertion for N ext

m -sectional quiver. As a summary,

(i) If N ext
(ii) If N ext

m -sectional quiver is connected, every vertex in it has p as its summand,
m -sectional quiver is not connected, N ext

m -sectional quiver is decomposed into two
m whose vertices share p as their ﬁrst summand and

connected N-sectional paths, N 1
N 2

m whose vertices share −p as their second summand.

The assertion restricted to Sext

m -sectional quiver follows from (5) in Proposition 5.3. More

m -sectional quiver is connected, then N ext

(1) Since every vertex in the N-sectional path of length n − 1 in ΓQ is of the form [a, n],

the assertion (1) follows from Remark 4.15 and (iii) in Algorithm 4.34.

(2) Since every vertex in the S-sectional path of length n − 1 in ΓQ is of the form [1, b],

the assertion (2) hold by the same reason of (1).
(3) This assertion follows from Theorem 4.3.

(cid:3)

Now we can rename the notions in Deﬁnition 5.1 by considering the above results:

Deﬁnition 5.7.

(1) An m-snake is renamed as a [p]-snake if every vertex of the snake has p or −p as a

summand.

(2) An N ext

m -sectional (resp. Sext

m -sectional) quiver is renamed as the N ext[±p]-sectional

(resp. Sext[±p]-sectional) quiver if every vertex of it has p or −p as a summand.
(3) An Xm-sectional path is renamed as the X[p]-sectional (resp. X[−p]-sectional) path

if every vertex of it has p (resp. −p) as a summand. Here X = N or S.

(4) An m-swing is renamed as the [p]-swing (resp.

[−p]-swing) if it is the union of the
N[p]-sectional path (resp. N[−p]-sectional path) and the S[p]-sectional path (resp.
S[−p]-sectional path)

We sometimes call the N ext[±p]-sectional quiver or Sext[±p]-sectional quiver by an extended

p-sectional quiver.

Theorem 5.8. For the folded AR-quiver
and only if α is in the [p]-snake.

Υ[i0], a root α ∈ Φ+ has p or −p as a summand if

Proof. Note that the number of roots with p or −p as a summand is the same as 2n which is
also the number of vertices in the m-snake for any m ∈ Z. Thus our assertion follows from
(cid:3)
Proposition 5.4.

Corollary 5.9.

(1) For p ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n + 1}, a root α ∈ Φ+ has p (resp. −p) as its summand if and only

if α is in the [p]-swing (resp. [−p]-swing).

(2) The root ha, bi is the intersection of the [a]-swing and the [b]-swing.

Proof. It is an immediate consequence from the fact that [p]-snake is the union of [p]-swing
(cid:3)
and [−p]-swing.

Corollary 5.10. Let

Υ[i0] be the folded AR-quiver and let p ∈ I \ {n + 1}.

(1) For any (¯n, k) and (¯n, k + 2) in
(2) If a sectional path has a vertex in the ¯n-th residue then it is not the N[−p] nor the
S[−p]-sectional path, i.e. it is either N[p], S[p], N[±(n + 1)] or S[±(n + 1)]-sectional
path.

Υ[i0], these two vertices are in the same swing.

in same m-snake for some m. Note that all vertices with ¯n-th residue are contained in ΥC

Now we can characterize the [p]-snake for p = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 as follows:

Let {X, Y } = {N, S}.

(5.1)

• (p 6= n + 1 and 1) [p]-snake consists of one X-sectional path of length n − 1
and two sectional Y -paths Y 1 of length k contained in 1ΓQ and Y 2 of length l
contained in 2ΓQ∗ such that k + l = n−2. If Y = S then k = p −2, every vertex
in S1 has −p as its second summand and the remained vertices in [p]-snake have
p as their common summand. If Y = N, then k = p − 2, every vertex in N 2
has −p as its second summand and the remained vertices in [p]-snake have p
as their common summand.

• (p = n + 1) [n + 1]-snake consists of an N-sectional path (= N0-sectional path)
and an S-sectional path (= Sn+1-sectional path) of length n − 1 such that the
N-sectional path is located at the right of the S-sectional path.

• (p = 1) [n + 1]-snake consists of an N-sectional path and an S-sectional path
of length n − 1 such that the S-sectional path is located at the right of the
N-sectional path.

Proof. (i) is obvious. So here we give proofs for (ii) and (iii). Let α be on the N[ǫ1 · a1]
and S[ǫ2 · a2]-sectional paths and β be on the N[ε1 · b1] and S[ε2 · b2]-sectional paths, where
ǫ1, ǫ2, ε1, ε2 are 1 or −1. It is obvious that a1 6= b1 and a2 6= b2. Observe that the N ext[±a1]-
sectional (resp. N ext[±b1]-sectional) quiver and the Sext[±b2]-sectional (resp. Sext[±a2]-
sectional) quiver have an intersection γ (resp. η). By (3) in Proposition 5.3, we have a1 6= b2
and b1 6= a2. Hence a1, b1, a2 and b2 are distinct. Now, by Proposition 5.4 and Corollary 5.5,
γ has ǫ1 · a1 and ε2 · b2 as its summands and η has ǫ2 · a2 and ε1 · b1 as its summands, which
(cid:3)
implies α + β = γ + η.

Proposition 6.2. Let us take three vertices in the ﬁrst and second residues of twisted AR-
quiver Υ[i0] such that :

Then we have α + β = η.

Proof. It follows from the additive property of adapted AR-quiver of type An if three vertices
are induced from 1ΓQ (resp. 2ΓQ∗) in Algorithm 4.34. Otherwise, α = ha1, ±(n + 1)i and
(cid:3)
β = hb1, ±(−n − 1)i. Then we know η = α + β by Proposition 4.30.

Then we have α + β = η + γ = µ + ν.

Proof. By Algorithm 4.34, we can see that summands of α and β lie in {1, 2, · · · , n + 1} ∪
{−n − 1}. More precisely, if α (resp. β) has negative summand (−n − 1) then it is shared by
every element in the N[−n − 1] (resp. S[−n − 1])-sectional path. Let α be on the N[ǫ · a1]
and S[a2]-sectional paths and β be on the N[b1] and S[ε · b2]-sectional paths. By Corollary
5.10, we know that

• η in on the N[a2]-sectional and the S[b1]-sectional paths,
• γ is on the N ext[±a1]-sectional and Sext[±b2]-sectional quivers.

Since α and γ (resp. β and γ) are in the same connected component of N ext[±a1]-sectional
(resp. Sext[±b2]-sectional) quiver, γ is on the N[ǫ · a1] and S[ε · b2]-sectional quivers. Since γ
and η have ǫ · a1, a2, b1 and ε · b2 as their summands, we conclude that

Now, by Proposition 6.1, our assertion follows.

α + β = η + γ.

By Proposition 6.1, Proposition 6.2 and Proposition 6.3, we obtain the twisted additive

property of Υ[i 0], which is stated as follows:

Theorem 6.4 (Twisted additive property of Dn+1). Let α and β be two roots in Φ+ whose
folded coordinates are (¯i, p − 2|¯i|) and (¯i, p) in the folded AR-quiver
Υ[i0]. Here |¯i| denotes the
number of indices in the orbit ¯i. Then

α + β =

γ,

b

where J ⊂ Φ+ consists of γ which are on paths from α to β and have coordinates (¯j, p−2|¯i|−1)
for ¯j ∈ ¯I.

Xγ∈J

Remark 6.5. For adapted classes of type ADEn and twisted adapted classes of type A2n+1,
additive properties can be understand as analogous properties of Theorem 6.4.

(1) In order to see the cases for adapted classes, we can consider ordinary Coxeter elements
are associated to the identity map on I. Then the order of every orbit |¯i| = 1. (Note
that the identity map on I is not compatible with the involution ∗). Observe that, in
(2.4), the coordinates of β and φQ(β) are (i, p) and (i, p−2) = (i, p−2|¯i|), respectively.
Hence, for α = φQ(β), the additive property (2.4) can be rewritten as follows:

α + β =

γ,

Xγ∈J
where J ⊂ Φ+ consists of γ which are on paths from α to β and have coordinates
(j, p − 2|¯i|−1) = (j, p − 1) for j ∈ I.

(2) In [24, Proposition 7.7], we proved the analogous statement holds for twisted adapted

classes of type A2n+1.

Example 6.6. See the last quiver in Example 4.38. Then the twisted additive property can
be checked in this quiver. For example,

h2, 4i + h3, 5i = h4, 5i + h2, 3i ,

h2, −5i + h4, 5i = h2, 4i ,

h1, 3i + h2, 5i = h3, 5i + h1, 2i .

7. Twisted Dynkin quiver and Reflection functors

Recall the diagram (2.6). For the twisted adapted classes, we introduced the twisted AR-
quivers, the twisted Coxeter elements and the twisted adapted classes. Hence the only thing
we want to generalize in (2.6) is a Dynkin quiver Q.

Deﬁnition 7.1. A twisted Dynkin quiver of Dn+1 is obtained by giving an orientation to
each edge in one of the following diagrams:

We denote by Q←n a Dynkin quiver obtained from the diagram (7.1) and by Q←n+1 a Dynkin
quiver obtained from the diagram (7.2).

Remark 7.2. Considering the number of indices to each vertex, the diagrams in the above
deﬁnition can be understood as the Dynkin diagram of type Cn.

Remark 7.4. Deﬁnition 7.1 is natural in the sense that (1.2) is related to the folding oper-
ation letting n and n + 1 be overlapped.

Deﬁnition 7.5.

(1) We say i 6= n, n + 1 is a sink (resp. source) of Q←n or Q←n+1 if every arrow connecting

i and another vertex j is entering into (resp. exiting out of) i.

(2) We say i = n is a sink (resp. source) of Q←n if there is the arrow from n − 1 to

n

to n − 1). Similarly, i = n + 1 is a sink (resp. source) of Q←n+1 if

Deﬁnition 7.6. For i ∈ In+1, the reﬂection function ri on Q←n (resp. Q←n+1) is deﬁned as
follows.

• If i 6= n, n + 1 and i is a sink or a source in Q←n (resp. Q←n+1) then i Q←n (resp.
i Q←n+1) is obtained by reversing all the arrows entering in to or exiting out of i.
• If i 6= n, n+ 1 and i is neither a sink nor a source then i Q←n = Q←n (resp. i Q←n+1 =

Q←n+1).

• If i = n (resp. i = n + 1) then i Q←n (resp. i Q←n+1) is obtained by (i) substituting
⊙ (resp. ⊗) by ⊗ (resp. ⊙) and (ii) reversing the arrow entering into or exiting out
of i.

• If i = n + 1 (resp. i = n) then iQ←n = Q←n (resp. iQ←n+1 = Q←n+1).

Now we can associate a reduced expression to a twisted Dynkin quiver.

Deﬁnition 7.7. Let i = i1 i2 · · · , iℓ(w) be a reduced word of w ∈ W D
to Q←n (resp. Q←n+1) if

n+1. We say i is adapted

ik is a sink of ik−1ik−2 · · · i2i1 Q←n (resp. ik−1ik−2 · · · i2i1 Q←n+1)

for k = 1, 2, · · · , ℓ(w).

The following proposition shows the interesting relations between twisted Dynkin quivers

and reduced expressions.

Proposition 7.8.

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

(1) There is the canonical one-to-one correspondence between the set of twisted Coxeter
elements and the set of twisted Dynkin quivers. Thus we can deﬁne φQ←n and φQ←n+1
in a natural way.

(2) Let us denote φ[[Q←]] := { φQ←n, φQ←n+1 | Q←n and Q←n+1 are twisted Dynkin quivers }.

Then

φ[[Q←]] = { φ[i0] | [i0] is a twisted adapted class }.

(3) If [i0] is a twisted adapted class of reduced expressions with twisted Coxeter element

φQ←n (resp. φQ←n+1) then i0 is adapted to Q←n (resp. Q←n+1).

Proof. (1) follows by Proposition 3.5. (2) follows from the correspondence between twisted
Coxeter elements and twisted Dynkin quivers proved in (1) and the correspondence between
twisted Coxeter elements and classes of twisted adapted classes. Finally, (3) follows from the
facts that

(i) if i1 i2 is adapted to φQ←n (resp. φQ←n+1) and [i1 i2] = [i2 i1] then i2 i1 is also adapted to

φQ←n (resp. φQ←n+1),

is adapted to Q←n (resp. Q←n+1).

(cid:3)

Using Proposition 7.8, let us introduce simpler notations:

Deﬁnition 7.9. We denote by [[Q←]] the twisted adapted cluster point of Dn+1 and denote
[Q←n+1]) the class of reduced expressions adapted to Q←n (resp. Q←n+1).
by [Q←n] (resp.
Also, we denote by i 0 ∈ [Q←] when i 0 is twisted adapted and denote by Q← the twisted
Dynkin quiver.

With the notion of sinks and sources of Q←, we have an analogue of Lemma 4.4 for folded

AR-quiver:

Lemma 7.10. For any folded AR-quiver, positions of simple roots inside of
boundary of

Υ[Q←]; that is, either

Υ[Q←] are on the

Furthermore,

(a) all sinks and sources of
(b) i is a sink (resp. source) of Q← if and only if αi is a sink (resp. source) of

We give a proposition about relations between Q← and Υ[Q←] without proof.

Proposition 7.12.
(1) The subquiver consisting of { (i, ξ(¯i)) | i = 1, · · · , n } of Υ[Q←] is isomorphic to Q←, where

ξ is the height function on ¯I.

(2) Using Q← and φQ←, we can recover Υ[Q←].
(3) If i ∈ In+1 is a sink of Q← then i Q← is associated twisted Dynkin quiver to Υ[Q←] · ri;
i.e. Υ[iQ←] = Υ[Q←] · ri. Here Υ[Q←] · ri is the twisted AR-quiver associated to ri[Q←].

Now we described the reﬂection functor ri on [Q←] (equivalently, the map obtaining Υ[iQ←]

from Υ[Q←]) in a combinatorial way:

Algorithm 7.13. Let h∨ = 2n + 2 be a dual Coxeter number of Dn+1, an index i be a sink
of Q← ∈ [[Q←]] and ∗ be the involution of Dn+1 such that w0(αi) = −αi∗.

(D1) Remove the vertex (i, ξ(¯i)) and the arrows entering into the vertex.
(D2) Add the vertex (i∗, ξ(¯i) − h∨) and the arrows to all vertices whose coordinates are
( j , ξ(¯i) − h∨ + 1 ) ∈ Υ[i0] where j is an index adjacent to i∗ in the Dynkin diagram
∆D

(D3) Label the vertex (i∗, ξ(¯i) − h∨) with αi and change the labels β to si(β) for all β ∈

n+1.

Υ[Q←] \ {αi}.

Deﬁnition 8.8. [22, Deﬁnition 1.19] For a non-simple positive root γ ∈ Φ+\Π, the [j0]-radius
of γ, denoted by rds[j 0](γ), is the integer deﬁned as follows:
rds[j 0](γ) = max(gdist[j 0](p) | γ ≺b

[j 0] p).

Deﬁnition 8.9. [22, Deﬁnition 1.21] For a pair p, the [j0]-socle of p, denoted by soc[j 0](p), is
a [j 0]-simple sequence s such that

if such s exists uniquely.

8.2. Distances and radius for twisted adapted cluster points. Before we investigate
twisted adapted cluster points, we recall the following theorem which is about adapted cluster
points.

Theorem 8.10. [21, 22] Let Q be any Dynkin quiver of type ADm.

(1) For any pair (α, β) ∈ (Φ+)2, we have gdist[Q](α, β) ≤ max{m(γ) | γ = α, β }.
(2) For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π, we have

rds[Q](γ) = m(γ).

(3) For any p, soc[Q](p) is well-deﬁned.

In this section we prove the following theorem:

Theorem 8.11. Take any [Q←] ∈ [[Q←]] of type Dn+1.

(1) For any pair (α, β) ∈ (Φ+)2, we have gdist[Q←](α, β) ≤ max{m(γ) | γ = α, β } = 2.
(2) For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π,

(8.2)

rds[Q←](γ) = m(γ).

(3) For any p, soc[Q←](p) is well-deﬁned.

Proposition 8.12. Let γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π and γ ∈ ΥL

[Q←] ∪ ΥR
rds[Q←](γ) = m(γ) = 1.

[Q←]. Then

[Q←] ∪ ΥR

Proof. Note that γ ∈ ΥL
[Q←] is (folded) multiplicity free by Lemma 4.36. Thus any
pairs p = (α, β) and p′ = (α′, β′) with wt(p) = wt(p′) = γ consist of multiplicity free positive
roots α, α′, β and β′. By replacing αn+1 to αn, we can consider γ, α, α′, β and β′ as
positive roots of type An. Assume that γ ∈ ΥR
[Q←]. By the convexity of ≺[Q←], α and α′ are
also contained in ΥR
[Q←]. Then our assertion follows from Algorithm 4.34 and the fact that
rds[Q](γ) = 1 ([22, Theorem 4.15]) for Q = pDn+1
[Q←], we
(cid:3)
can apply the same argument.

Proposition 8.13. For γ ∈ ΥC

[Q←], we have

rds[Q←](γ) = m(γ) = 2.

TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS: II

39

Proof. Note that γ ∈ ΥC

[Q←] is not folded multiplicity free by Lemma 4.36. Thus
for some 1 ≤ a < b 6= n + 1.

γ = ha, bi

We have γ = ha, n + 1i + hb, −n − 1i = ha, −n − 1i + hb, n + 1i . Vertices ha, −n − 1i and
hb, −n − 1i are connected by a sectional path which is induced from the path between [a, n]
and [b, n] in ΓQ for Q = pDn+1
([Q←]). Also, we can apply the same argument for the pair
consisting of ha, n + 1i and hb, n + 1i. Hence ha, −n − 1i and hb, −n − 1i (resp. ha, n + 1i
and hb, n + 1i) are always comparable with respect to ≺[Q←] and

An

ha, −n − 1i ≺[Q←] (resp. ≻[Q←]) hb, −n − 1i ⇐⇒ ha, n + 1i ≺[Q←] (resp. ≻[Q←]) hb, n + 1i .

Thus we proved (ha, n + 1i , hb, −n − 1i) and (ha, −n − 1i , hb, n + 1i) are comparable with
respect to ≺b

[Q←] and hence rds[Q←](γ) ≥ 2 by the convexity of ≺[Q←].

Conversely, let us show that rds[Q←](γ) ≤ 2. Suppose not. Then there are c and d such

that

(1) |c| 6= |d| > b,
(2) p

1

= (ha, ci , hb, −ci) and p

= (ha, di , hb, −di) are comparable with respect to ≺[Q←].

Here we assume further that

(i) c 6= d > 0, (ii) p

≻b

[Q←] p

1

and (iii) ha, ci ≻[Q←] hb, −ci,

since other cases can be proved similarly. By (ii) and (iii), we have

ha, ci ≻[Q←] ha, di , hb, −di ≻[Q←] hb, −ci .

Hence the convexity of ≺[Q←] tells that two roots hb, −di and hb, −ci should be in ΥR
[Q←].
Moreover, the assumption ha, ci ≻[Q←] ha, di , hb, −di ≻[Q←] hb, −ci implies that we can ﬁnd
one of the following rectangles (not necessarily squares) in 1ΓQ with vertices [a, d−1], [a, c−1],
[b, d − 1] and [b, c − 1]:

[b, c − 1]

[b, d − 1]

[a, c − 1]

[a, d − 1]

[b, c − 1]

[a, d − 1]

In both cases, Algorithm 4.34 and (ii) in Remark 4.35 tell that

• ha, −ci and ha, −di are contained in ΥR
• there exists a path ha, di → ha, ci in 2ΓQ∗ ⊂ Υ[Q←].

Hence p

The ﬁrst step for Theorem 8.11. From the above three lemmas, the second assertion of
Theorem 8.11 follows. Furthermore, the ﬁrst and the third assertions for α + β ∈ Φ+ also
(cid:3)
hold.

Proof. It follows from [22, Theorem 4.15] and Algorithm 4.34.

(cid:3)

Proposition 8.15. If two positive roots α and β are in ΥC

[Q←] then
gdist[Q←](α, β) ≤ max{m(α), m(β)} = 2.

Proof. Note that

• every vertex in ΥC
• if α ≺[Q←] γ ≺[Q←] β then γ ∈ ΥC

[Q←] has αn and αn+1 as its support,
[Q←].

Since we are only interested in sequences with the same weight as α + β, any sequence whose
sum in α + β should be a pair. Thus it is enough to consider increasing sequences of pairs
with weight wt(p)

Suppose α and β are not in the same sectional. Let α = ha1, a2i and β = hb1, b2i for
distinct a1, a2, b1, b2 ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}. A pair (α′, β′) with same weight as p has a1, a2, b1 and
b2 as summands of α′ or β′. Hence it is enough to consider intersections of swings containing
α or β.

Now, the pair p = (α, β) should be one of (α0, β0), (α1, β1) and (α2, β2) and we have

gdist[Q←](αi, βi) = i

If α and β are in the same sectional path, there is no other pair whose weight is the same
(cid:3)

as α + β by Theorem 5.8 and the deﬁnition of ≺b

[Q←].

Lemma 8.16. Let α be in ΥC
no sequence m such that

[Q←] and β be in ΥR

[Q←] or ΥL

[Q←]. If α + β 6∈ Φ+ then there is

• the weight of m is same as α + β,
• m ≺b
[Q←] (α, β),
• m is not a pair.

Proof. Consider β ∈ ΥR
[Q←] and denote α = ha1, a2i and β = hb1, b2i . Note that b2 ∈
{−2, −3, · · · , −n − 1} ∪ {n + 1}. If |b2| < a1, the proposition directly follows from the

TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS: II

41

convexity of ≺[Q←]. Hence we only consider the case when |b2| ≥ a1. Also, we note that it is
enough to show when m is a triple.

Let us assume that |b2| > a1. Suppose there is a triple m = (γ, δ, η) where (α, β) ≻b

[Q←] m
and the weight is same as that of α+β. The set of summands of γ, δ and η is {a1, a2, b1, b2, c, −c}
for c ∈ {2, · · · , n + 1}\{a1, a2, b1, b2}. Without loss of generality, let γ have c as a summand
and let δ have −c as a summand.

(Case I) If the N-sectional path passing α and the S-sectional path passing β have an
intersection then the [c]-snake in Υ[Q←] looks like one of [c]-snake(1) and [c]-snake(2) in the

[c]-snake(2)

If the [c]-snake is of the form of [c]-snake(1) then there is no root having c as a summand
between α and β. On the other hand, if the [c]-snake is of the form of [c]-snake(2) then there
is no root having −c as a summand between α and β. Hence, in any case, we cannot ﬁnd
both γ and δ.

(Case II) Suppose N-sectional path passing α and S-sectional path passing β do not have
an intersection. This assumption implies |a2| ≥ |b2|, so that there is no root having a2 and
b2 as summands. In this case,

• α is the intersection between N[a2]-sectional path and S[a1]-sectional path.
• β is the intersection between N[b1]-sectional path and S[b2]-sectional path.

Also, from the fact that β ≺[Q←] γ, δ ≺[Q←] α, we can see that

• N[c]-sectional path and S[−c]-sectional path should be in between N[a2]-sectional

path and S[b2]-sectional path.

• (γ, δ) = (ha1, ci , hb1, −ci) or (ha1, −ci , hb1, ci).

However, since |a2| ≥ |b2|, there is no root of the form ha2, b2i . Hence α + β − γ − δ = η 6∈ Φ+,
which is a contradiction.

For the case |b2| = a1, we omit the proof since it can be proved similarly. Moreover, the
(cid:3)

same argument works when β ∈ ΥL

[Q←].

Proposition 8.17. Let α be in ΥC

[Q←] and β be in ΥR

[Q←] or ΥL

[Q←]. If α + β 6∈ Φ+ then

gdist[Q←](α, β) ≤ max{m(α), m(β)} = m(α) = 2.

Proof. By Lemma 8.16, it is enough to consider pairs p whose weight are same as that of
α + β. Now, we can apply the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 8.15 which was
(cid:3)
described in (8.4).

42

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

Proposition 8.18. Let α be in one of ΥL
then

[Q←] and ΥR

[Q←], and β be in the other. If α + β 6∈ Φ+

gdist[Q←](α, β) ≤ max{m(α), m(β)} = 1.

Proof. Note that α, β are (folded) multiplicity free and hence can be identiﬁed with corre-
sponding positive roots in Φ+
An in a natural way. Without loss of generality, assume that
[Q←] and β ∈ ΥR
α ∈ ΥL
[Q←]. Let us denote α = ha1, −a2i and β = hb1, −b2i. Then the
followings are true.

• If b1 − 1 > a2 or a1 − 1 > b2 then there is no other pair with the same weight and

hence gdist[Q←](α, β) = 0 ([22, (4.2)]).
• If b1 = −a2 or a1 = −b2 then α + β ∈ Φ+.
• If |a2| = |b2| = n + 1 then α + β 6∈ Φ+ implies a1 = b1. In this case, one can check

that gdist[Q←](α, β) = 0.

For the other cases, there exists another pair {γ, η} such that

α + β = γ + η 6∈ Φ+.

Note that such a pair {γ, η} is unique. There is a square in the AR-quiver ΓQ for Q =
pDn+1
([Q←]) which is one of the followings (Theorem 4.3 and [20, Proposition 4.12]):

[Q←] and (ii) η (resp. γ) is in ΥR

Here η = ha1, −b2i and γ = hb1, −a2i by Theorem 4.3 and they are also (folded) multiplicity

[Q←] to any vertex in
ΥR
[Q←]) . For the ﬁrst case, we get the path
α → γ → η → β by Algorithm 4.34 and the assumption of our assertion. For the second
case, we get the path γ → α → β → η by the same reason. Hence we get gdist[Q←](α, β) = 1
and gdist[Q←](α, β) = 0, respectively. For a non-pair sequence m such that wt(m) = α + β,
it cannot be m ≺[Q←] (α, β) by the convexity of ≺[Q←]. The remained cases can be proved
(cid:3)
by applying the similar argument.

Proof. Let us assume that α ≻[Q←] β. Then q > p. Depending on whether there exists an
intersection of the S-sectional path passing α and the N-sectional path passing β in
Υ[Q←],
we classify the type of the pair (α, β):

and the N-sectional path passing β.

• (α, β) is Type II if there exists an intersection between the two sectional paths.

the following properties:

More precisely, we can compute the coordinates as follows.

(8.6)

η = (η0, η1) = ((i + j + p − q)/2, i − j + p + q),
µ = (µ0, µ1) = (n + 1 + (i − j + p − q)/2, η1 + j − n − 1),
ν = (ν0, ν1) = (n + 1 + (j − i + p − q)/2, η1 + i − n − 1),
γ = (γ0, γ1) = (2n + 2 − (i + j − p + q)/2, µ1 + ν1 − η1).

44

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

Now we note that η0, µ0, ν0, γ0 depend only on i, j and |p − q|. Moreover, by Proposition
8.15, Proposition 8.17 and Proposition 8.18, we have
(8.7)

gdist[Q←](α, β) = 2 if η0 ≥ 0 and γ0 < n + 1;
gdist[Q←](α, β) = 1 if (i) (η0, γ0) 6∈ (Z≥0, Z<n+1), (ii) ( µ0, ν0 ) ∈ Z>0 × Z≥0 ∪ Z≥0 × Z>0;
gdist[Q←](α, β) = 0 otherwise.

(Type II) In this case, we have the following picture. As in (Type I), η is not necessarily
Υ[Q←]. However, γ′ is in

Υ[Q←].

(8.10)

γ′ = (γ′

1) = ((i + j − p + q)/2, p + q − η1)

gdist[Q←](α, β) = 1 if η0 ≥ 0;
gdist[Q←](α, β) = 0 otherwise .

Since γ0, η0, µ0, ν0 and γ′

0 depend only on i, j and |p−q| and by (8.7) and (8.10). Moreover,
the assumption 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n implies i = ¯i and j = ¯j. Hence we conclude that gdist[Q←](α, β)
only depends on ¯i, ¯j and |p − q|.
(cid:3)
Remark 8.21. Let α, β be positive roots of Dn+1 and the coordinates (¯i, p) and (¯j, q) of α
and β in

Υ[Q←] satisfy i ≥ j and q > p.

If (α, β) is of (Type I) in the proof of Theorem 8.20 then the pair (α, β) has the form of
(I − 1) ∼ (I − 8) in (8.11) or (8.12). Note that the layer n + 1 in (8.11) and (8.12) is induced
from the new coordinate introduced in the proof of Theorem 8.20.

(resp. µ0 = 0). The picture (ii) is of (Type II) in Theorem 8.20 and it implies η0 = 0.

gdist[Q←](α, β) using (8.5) and (8.8) by the following facts.

(1) gdist[Q←](α, β) = 2 if and only if γ, η, µ, ν in (8.5) are all in

9. Distance polynomial and Folded distance polynomial

In this section, we brieﬂy review the distance polynomials deﬁned on the adapted cluster
point [[Q]] of type ADEm, which was studied in [22]. Then we introduce and study the folded
distance polynomials as in [24], which are well-deﬁned on the twisted adapted cluster point
[[Q←]] of type Dn+1. The folded distance polynomials have an interesting relation with the
quantum aﬃne algebra of type C (1)
n . This section can be understood as a twisted analogue
of [22, Section 6].
In this section, we refer to and follow [22, Section 6] and [15] instead
of introducing the notions for quantum aﬃne algebras, their integrable representations and
denominator formulas.

Let us take a base ﬁeld k the algebraic closure of C(q) in ∪m>0C((q1/m)).

Deﬁnition 9.1. [22, Deﬁnition 6.11] For a Dynkin quiver Q, indices k, l ∈ I and an integer

A pair (α, β) is contained in ΦQ(k, l)[t] if α ≺Q β or β ≺Q α and

{

φQ(β)} = {(k, a), (l, b)}

We denoted by Qrev the quiver obtained by reversing all arrows of Q and Q∗ the quiver

obtained from Q by replacing vertices i of Q with i∗ (see (4.5) for ∗ of type Dn+1).

Deﬁnition 9.3. [22, Deﬁnition 6.15] For k, l ∈ I and a Dynkin quiver Q, we deﬁne a

Appendix A. Triply twisted Dynkin quiver

a unique ∨2-foldable cluster [j 0] for ∨ in (1.3):

i 0 =

In this appendix, we will introduce a triply twisted Dynkin quivers which can be analogues

of twisted Dynkin quivers in Section 7.

Deﬁnition A.1. A ∨-triply twisted Dynkin quiver Q←
quiver Q←

(i,j,k) (resp. ∨2-triply twisted Dynkin
(i′,j′,k′)) of D4 is obtained by giving an orientation to each edge to following diagrams:

.

◦

where {i, i∨ = j, i2∨ = k} = {1, 3, 4} = {i′, i′2∨ = j′, i′4∨ = k′}.

Then we can complete analogues of (7.3) for ∨ and ∨2 by applying the similar arguments

in Section 7:

• For each triply twisted adapted class [i ′

unique expression i ′

0 in [i ′

• For each triply twisted adapted class [i ′

(i,j,k) or Q←
