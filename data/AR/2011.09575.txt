Abstract Due to their characteristic temperature and density, loop structures
in active regions (ARs) can be seen bright in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft
X-ray images. The semiempirical determination of the three-dimensional (3D)
distribution of basic physical parameters (electronic density and temperature,
and magnetic ﬁeld) is a key constraint for coronal heating models. In this work
we develop a technique for the study of EUV bright loops based on diﬀerential
emission measure (DEM) analysis and we ﬁrst apply it to AR structures observed
by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). The 3D structure and intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld of

the observed EUV loops are modelled using force-free ﬁeld extrapolations based
on magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on
board SDO. In this work we report the results obtained for several bright loops
identiﬁed in diﬀerent ARs. Our analysis indicates that the mean and width of
the temperature distributions are nearly invariant along the loop lengths. For a
particular loop we study its temporal evolution and ﬁnd that these characteristics
remain approximately constant for most of its life time. The appearance and
disappearance of this loop occurs at time-scales much shorter than its life time of
≈ 2.5 hours. The results of this analysis are compared with numerical simulations
using the zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic model, Enthalpy-Based Thermal
Evolution of Loops (EBTEL). We study two alternative heating scenarios: ﬁrst,
we apply a constant heating rate assuming loops in quasi-static equilibrium,
and second, we heat the loops using impulsive events or nanoﬂares. We ﬁnd that
all the observed loops are overdense with respect to a quasi-static equilibrium
solution and that the nanoﬂare heating better reproduces the observed densities
and temperatures.

1. Introduction

The solar corona is a highly inhomogeneous plasma structured by the magnetic
ﬁeld. It is formed by magnetic ﬂux tubes where the plasma is conﬁned. These
building blocks of the solar corona are called loops. In active regions (ARs),
where the magnetic ﬁeld is very intense, some loops are visible in extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray images, due to their characteristic temperature
and density.

AR loops are usually classiﬁed as warm and hot (Reale, 2014). While the
hot loops, observed in soft X-ray images, are located in the AR core and have
temperatures above 2 MK, warm loops are observed in the EUV range, are
located in the AR periphery, and have temperatures between 1.0 to 1.5 MK. A
third category is that of cool loops below 1.0 MK.

The ﬁrst studies of AR loops using soft X-ray observations from Skylab showed
that hot loops are consistent with static or quasi-static equilibrium (Rosner,
Tucker, and Vaiana, 1978). Later studies based on high spatial and temporal
resolution observations in the EUV range, as those provided by the Transition
Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) showed that warm loops are typically
not consistent with quasi-static equilibrium. Their characteristic density and
scale height are larger than those predicted by static equilibrium conditions
for their respective temperatures (Aschwanden, Schrijver, and Alexander, 2001;
Winebarger, Warren, and Mariska, 2003).

Diﬀerent mechanisms were proposed to explain overdensity in warm loops.
One plausible scenario contemplates quasi-steady heating concentrated at the
loop footpoints (near the chromospheric base). This kind of mechanism can
reproduce the observed densities and temperatures, but the loop evolves to a

SOLA: ms_fanuevo_v3.tex; 20 November 2020; 1:31; p. 2

3D Resconstruction of Loop Density and Temperature

thermal non-equilibrium producing important asymmetries in the density distri-
bution along it (Lionello et al., 2013; Klimchuk, Karpen, and Antiochos, 2010).
In another scenario the loop is heated by an impulsive mechanism along its
coronal part (e.g. in the form of nanoﬂares). This mechanism also reproduces
the observed densities and temperatures, but the predicted temporal evolution
of the loop results more dynamic than actually observed (Klimchuk, 2015). This
discrepancy can be explained if the loop is made of unresolved strands that
evolve independently (see e.g. L´opez Fuentes, Klimchuk, and Mandrini 2007).

In this article, we select and analyse a series of active region (AR) loops
observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al. 2012) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell, Thompson, and Cham-
berlin 2012). We develop a diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) technique to
analyse EUV images and reconstruct the electron temperature and density along
the observed loops. We use linear force-free ﬁeld (LFFF) extrapolations of the
AR magnetic ﬁeld to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the ob-
served loops. As boundary condition for the extrapolations we use magnetograms
obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012)
on board SDO. For a particular loop we also study the temporal evolution of
the obtained plasma parameters.

We study the consistency of the evolution of the analysed loops with the two
scenarios mentioned before: quasi-static equilibrium with a constant heating
along them and nanoﬂare heating, we compare our results with the electron
density and temperature values predicted by a hydrodynamic (HD) model. To
this end, we use the code Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL)
(Klimchuk, Patsourakos, and Cargill, 2008), whose input parameters are the
heating rate function and the loop length.

In Section 2, we describe the loop selection, DEM analysis, and magnetic
ﬁeld modelling. In Section 3, we present our results and we study the temporal
evolution of one of the analysed loops. In Section 4, we describe the EBTEL
hydrodynamic model and compare our results with the solutions of the model.
Finally, we discuss and conclude in Section 5.

2. Methodology

2.1. EUV Data and Loop Selection

Using images provided by the AIA telescope on board the SDO spacecraft,
we select as target for this study several loops observed at the periphery of
various ARs. We choose images in which the target loops are observed at their
maximum brightness, determined by inspection of image time-series of each AR.
The selection criterion is that a signiﬁcant portion, or the totality of the loop,
should be visible in the EUV images. To visually select the loops we use the 171
˚A AIA channel, corroborating that they are also visible in other channels (e.g.
131 and 193 ˚A). Table 1 lists all the loops selected for our study, indicating the
AR to which the loop belongs and the date and time of the image where it has
been identiﬁed.

To perform a diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) analysis to reconstruct the
loop density and temperature, we select locations uniformly distributed along
the loop, covering most of its observed length. As an example, the left panel of
Figure 1 shows the 171 ˚A AIA image of AR NOAA 11130 used to identify loop
number 1 (see Table 1). The black dots over the loop are the spatial locations
where we perform the DEM analysis. The magenta line corresponds to the ﬁeld
line from the LFFF model that best ﬁts the loop (see Section 2.3). As another
example, the right panel of Figure 1 shows the 171 ˚A AIA image used to identify
loop number 6 (AR NOAA 11670) in a similar fashion to the left panel.

2.2. DEM Analysis at Selected Loop Locations

To obtain the intrinsic intensity of the loops selected for analysis, we subtract
the background intensity following the method developed by Aschwanden et al.
(2013). For each target loop, sample data points (black dots in Figure 1) are
selected by careful visual inspection. Those dots are then ﬁtted with a polyno-
mial function to determine the main axis of the loop. A bi-linear interpolation
scheme is then applied to the image data along and around the main axis of
the loop in order to produce a stretched-out image of the loop. This is done for
the images provided by the six analysed AIA channels. Examples of stretched-
out images for loops 1 and 6 are shown in the left panels of Figures 2 and 3,
respectively. As indicated in the images, the main axis of the loop is called s, and
the perpendicular (cross-sectional) axis in the plane of the sky is called x. At
each location si, the intensity of data points Ik,i(x) along axis x (with x having
units of pixels), for each channel k, are measured and ﬁtted to a parametric

model, the Gaussian function represents the steep transverse intensity variation

The ﬁtting given by Equation 1 is carried out in two steps. The parameters

the intrinsic emission of the bright loop. The extremes of the segment along x
are selected by careful visual inspection point by point along each loop. The

then estimated at each pixel x as

We use the 171 ˚A channel to identify the EUV loops, as they exhibit strong
emission close to ≈ 1 MK. The method described above is ﬁrst applied to this
image so that the parameters corresponding to the intrinsic cross-sectional loop
intensity for this channel are found at each location si, namely I (0)
171,i, xi,0 and
σi,0.

For the other channels, the ﬁrst step of the ﬁtting method is applied to deter-
mine the linear function for the background emission, i.e. to ﬁnd parameters I (1)
k,i
and I (2)
k,i . Equation 2 is then used to ﬁnd the EUV bright loop intrinsic intensity
data points I (loop)
(x) for each channel. We then estimate the total intrinsic
(background subtracted) intensity of the loop in channel k at each location si
as the integral

(3)

Note that the integral is performed over the range of pixels x where the signal-
to-noise (S/N) ratio of the EUV intensity is largest.

As the EUV loops are best visible in the 171 ˚A channel, the centroid and
width of the EUV bright loop for all other channels are set to the values found
for 171 ˚A, i.e. x0,i and σ0,i, respectively. Finally, the amplitude of the Gaussian
model of the EUV loop intrinsic intensity is estimated as

k,i = I (0)
I (0)

171,i

(4)

The motivation for the choice of Equation 4, is that, assuming a coronal ﬁlling
factor of order one, the amplitude-to-area ratio of the Gaussian model is set
uniform for all channels.

The right panels of Figure 2 and 3 show the cross-sectional intensity proﬁles
(in black colour) and the corresponding Gaussian and linear (drawn as a stair-
case like curve) ﬁts in orange and black colour, respectively, at selected points
along the main axis of loops number 1 and 6.

As a measure of the (dimensionless) fractional uncertainty of the intrinsic
intensity ∆(I (0)
k,i due to the ﬁt and background subtraction procedure,
we compute the diﬀerence between the observed and modelled total intrinsic
intensity, Sk and Smod

where the modelled total intrinsic intensity Smod
is computed using Equation 3
but replacing Ik,i(x) by I mod
in the integrand. In points where the ﬁt is nearly
perfect this measure tends to zero. In points where the ﬁt is highly unrepresen-
tative of the observed intensity proﬁle this measure can be as high as the order
of one.

After the background emission subtraction method is applied, the intrinsic
intensities I (0)
k,i for all channels k are used to perform a DEM analysis at each
location si of each loop. Applied to image pixels, DEM techniques allow de-
termination of the temperature distribution function, DEM(T ). This function
measures the amount of plasma at temperature T that is along the line-of-
sight (LOS) associated to the pixel. Applied to the intrinsic intensities, this
DEM function measures the distribution of the emitting plasma located only at
the observed bright loop. In this work, we use the parametric DEM technique
developed by Nuevo et al. (2015), adapted for the speciﬁc study of bright AR
loops. While the DEM function can be obtained using Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods (Kashyap and Drake, 1998) or regularised inversion
techniques (Hannah and Kontar, 2012) for spectroscopic data, the parametric
modelling of the DEM is more adequate when narrow-band images are used as
input, because it gives simple and computationally eﬃcient solutions. However,
recent works have shown improvements of MCMC DEM modelling applied to
AIA narrow-band images using the six channels simultaneously (Schmelz, Chris-
tian, and Chastain, 2016; Schmelz et al., 2015). Here, we use the 131, 171, and
193 ˚A AIA channels, where the studied loops exhibit a larger S/N ratio.

The intrinsic intensity amplitude I (0)

k,i determined at each analysed location,
of each channel can be written in terms of the DEM(T ) function at that location
as

(cid:90)

I (0)
k,i =

dT TRFk(T ) DEMi(T ) ,

(6)

where TRFk(T ) is the temperature response function, TRF, of channel k. We
compute the TRFs of AIA channels using the plasma emission model CHIANTI
7.1 (Landi et al., 2013). For the calculation of the model we use the abundance
set sun coronal 2012 schmelz.abund (Schmelz et al., 2012) and the ionization
equilibrium calculation set chianti.ioneq (Bryans, Landi, and Savin, 2009).

We model the DEM as a Gaussian function with three free parameters: am-
plitude, centroid, and width, and we obtain the solution ﬁnding the values of
the parameters that best reproduce the intensities I (0)
k,i .

Once the DEM is determined at each location si, the emission measure, EM,
and the mean electron temperature across the loop section, Tm, can be computed
by taking its zeroth and ﬁrst moments,

Assuming a circular cross-section, the diameter of the loop at each location si

function in Equation 1, di = 2
Other methods can be used to estimate the diameter of the loop. For example,
L´opez Fuentes, Klimchuk, and D´emoulin (2006) used the relation between the
standard deviation of the cross-section intensity proﬁle and the radius of the
loop (after background subtraction). In that work, the authors showed that both
methods lead to similar loop-width values.

The electron density at each location si can be obtained from the EMi and
the diameter di of the loop using the following expression (Aschwanden et al.,
2013):

Ne,i =

(9)

where f is the ﬁlling factor, i.e. the fraction of the observed volume occupied
by the emitting plasma. In this work we assume f = 1, so the values of the
reconstructed electron density are a lower limit. As an example, if f = 0.75, the
values of the reconstructed electron density increase by around 15%.

The second moment of the DEM is the standard deviation of the thermal

distribution described by the DEM.

2.3. Magnetic Field Modeling

To obtain the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the observed loop, we model
the magnetic ﬁeld using the LFFF approximation, given by

∇ × B = α B ,

(11)

where α is a constant that is the free parameter of the model. We compute
the model using the discrete fast-Fourier transform method discussed by Alis-
sandrakis (1981) and its implementation, including the transformation of co-
ordinates from the local AR frames to the observed ones, by Mandrini et al.
(1996) and D´emoulin et al. (1997). Since the magnetic conﬁgurations of all the
extrapolated ARs have a low shear, a LFFF model is good enough to represent
the analysed loops.

We use as boundary condition the line-of-sight magnetogram obtained with
HMI closest in time to the 171 ˚A AIA image from which each target loop is
identiﬁed. In the top panels of Figure 1, we show in red the projection on the
image of the magnetic ﬁeld line of the corresponding LFFF model that better

matches the shape of the selected EUV bright loop. In the bottom panels of the
same ﬁgure we depict the modelled ﬁeld lines using another point of view to
illustrate their 3D geometry.

We set the value of α that best matches the observed loop following the
procedure discussed by Green et al. (2002). This procedure lets us assign the
approximate 3D coordinates to the sample locations where the DEM analysis is
performed (black dots in Figure 1).

3. Results

3.1. Reconstructed Plasma Parameters of the Loops

Combination of the density and temperature values, determined from the DEM
analysis, with the geometry of the loops, reconstructed using LFFF extrapola-
tions, provide a description of the 3D distributions of the physical parameters
of the loops. For example, Figures 4 and 5 show the variation with the distance
s along the loop (measured from the photosphere) of the reconstructed electron
density, Ne, mean temperature, Tm, and magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, for loops
number 1 and 6, respectively.

Figure 3. Same as Figure 2 for loop number 6.

Figures 4 and 5 display error bars for the electron density and mean tem-
perature, which depend on the uncertainty of the intensities used for the DEM
analysis. The dominating sources of uncertainty are the radiometric calibration
of the AIA ﬁlters, and the ﬁt and background subtraction procedure described
in Section 2.2. The absolute radiometric calibration uncertainty is of the order
of 25% and the relative calibration uncertainty among the diﬀerent channels is
of the order of 10% (Boerner et al., 2014). The uncertainty introduced by the ﬁt
and background subtraction procedure is estimated in this work using Equation
5.

To estimate the error bars of Ne and Tm, ∆Ne and ∆Tm, we perform an
“error box” analysis, considering simultaneously both sources of uncertainty in a
similar fashion to the method described in detail in Nuevo et al. (2015). Treating
uncertainties as independent, we vary the observed trios of EUV intensities
used for the DEM analysis, either increasing or decreasing each of the three
observed values, considering all possible combinations. In this way, 23 = 8 DEM
analysis are performed at each sample point of every loop. As a result, at each
point of every loop eight possible values of the electron density and temperature
are obtained. The error bar in density (or temperature) is estimated using the
corresponding maximum and minimum values.

For each analysed loop, we characterise the results of the DEM analysis
computing the average value (cid:104)q(cid:105) and standard deviation StDev(q) of each DEM
product q = Ne, Tm, and WT . Table 2 summarizes the results for all 13 target
loops. For all loops, the (cid:104)Ne(cid:105) values are within the range 0.5 − 2.5 ×109 cm−3,
while the (cid:104)Tm(cid:105) values are in the range 1.0 − 1.5 MK. These values are consistent

with the characteristic ones obtained in previous studies of bright EUV loops ob-
served in ARs (Aschwanden and Boerner, 2011; Aschwanden et al., 2013). Also,
for all loops studied in this work, the cross-sectional DEM average temperature
Tm does not vary signiﬁcantly along their main axis, with the DEM temperature
standard deviation in the range 0.05 − 0.2(cid:104)Tm(cid:105).

Column 6 of Table 2 shows the loop-averaged ratio between the thermal
width, WT , and the mean temperature Tm. Column 7 shows the loop-averaged
ratio between the temperature uncertainty ∆Tm and Tm. Comparing (cid:104)WT /Tm(cid:105)
with (cid:104)∆Tm/Tm(cid:105), we consider that the studied loops are not isothermal, globally
speaking, but multithermal structures. However, as this thermal width holds all
along our loops, we can assure that their temperature, which is an average on
the cross-sectional thermal distribution, does not substantially vary along the
loop.

3.2. Temporal Evolution of Loop Parameters: A Case Study

To study the temporal evolution of the computed plasma parameters we take
loop number 1 as case study. We analyse the loop over a period of two hours and
an a half (19:16 to 21:46 UT) from the ﬁrst to the last AIA 171 ˚A images in which
it is clearly identiﬁable. For each observation time we reconstruct the density
and temperature proﬁles using the technique described in Section 2.2. Before
19:16 UT and after 21:46 UT the loop is very diﬀuse, so that the fractional
uncertainty introduced by the ﬁt and background subtraction procedure is of

order one. Figure 6 shows the loop-averaged values of the 171 ˚A intensity, electron
density, and temperature at each time. For each data point, the bar indicates
the standard deviation of the values along the loop at that time. In the top
panel the orange dots are the 171 ˚A intensities without background subtraction
and the blue dots are the values with background subtraction. We ﬁnd that the
background emission at each location along the loop accounts for 70 − 90 % of
the measured total intensity.

For this loop, density and temperature do not vary in time in a signiﬁcant
way within the standard deviation values. The results for the rest of the loops
in our set are similar. This suggests that all the analysed loops detected in the
AIA 171 ˚A channel are at their mid-lifetime period (i.e. not rising nor decaying
in intensity) and therefore the obtained parameters are typical of these loops.

4. Comparison of the Results with HD Models

4.1. Constant Heating

To characterise the thermodynamic state of the observed loops, we use the results
of the DEM analysis to constrain hydrodynamic (HD) numerical simulations of
the loops. We compute equilibrium solutions of the zero-dimensional (0D) HD
model Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL), developed by
Klimchuk, Patsourakos, and Cargill (2008). The EBTEL model provides the
temporal evolution of the plasma parameters averaged along the loop. This
model divides the loop in two segments, one corresponding to the corona and the
other to the transition region (TR). It also assumes that the loop is symmetric
with a uniform cross-section. Integrating the energy balance equation between
the coronal base of the loop and its apex, the following expression is obtained

E Λ ((cid:104)Te(cid:105)E) is the radiative loss ﬂux in units of [erg cm−2 s−1]
where φR,E = (cid:104)Ne(cid:105)2
and Λ ((cid:104)Te(cid:105)E) is the radiative loss function. The ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand
side of Equation 12 are the enthalpy and conductive ﬂux at the coronal base,
respectively. The quantities (cid:104)P (cid:105)E, (cid:104)Ne(cid:105)E, and (cid:104)Te(cid:105)E are the loop-averaged values
of the pressure, density, and temperature, respectively. The quantity EH is the
heating rate in units of [erg cm−3 s−1], assumed here to be uniform along the
loop and constant in time, and L is the length of the loop. Integrating the energy
balance equation in the transition region, a similar equation can be derived.

The energy balance equations of the corona and the TR can be combined to

solve the temporal evolution of (cid:104)P (cid:105)E, (cid:104)Ne(cid:105)E, and (cid:104)Te(cid:105)E.

In our simulations the free parameters of the EBTEL model are the length of
the loop, L, and the constant heating rate, EH . For each of the thirteen studied
loops we found the value of EH for an equilibrium solution of the EBTEL model
with the loop length L obtained from the LFFF model (column 6 of Table 2) and
the loop-averaged temperature value from the DEM analysis, speciﬁcally from
column 4 of Table 2. The last column of Table 3 shows the ratio between the

a loop-averaged quantity, namely, the 171 ˚A intensity (top panel), the DEM electron density
(middle panel), and the DEM mean temperature (bottom panel). In the top panel, the intensity
is shown before and after background subtraction in orange and blue colours, respectively. In
the middle and bottom panels blue colour is used as derived from the DEM analysis based
on the background subtracted intensities. At each time, the error bars indicate the standard
deviation of all measured values along the loop.

loop-averaged density value, (cid:104)Ne(cid:105), of the DEM analysis (column 3 in Table 2)
and the loop-averaged density predicted by EBTEL assuming a constant heating
rate, (cid:104)Ne(cid:105)Econst .

The average density values obtained with the DEM analysis are 5 to 150 times
larger than those predicted by the equilibrium solution of the EBTEL model.
These results strongly suggest that the studied loops are overdense as is the case
for warm loops studied in other works (Aschwanden, Schrijver, and Alexander,
2001; Winebarger, Warren, and Mariska, 2003).

One of the main diﬀerences between warm and hot loops is the dominant
cooling mechanism at their respective characteristic temperatures. While warm
loops are primarily cooled by radiative losses, hot loops are mainly cooled by
thermal conduction. L´opez Fuentes, Klimchuk, and Mandrini (2007) derived the
following scaling laws for the characteristic times associated to the processes of
radiative and thermal conduction cooling:

where κ0 is the Spitzer thermal conductivity coeﬃcient and kB is the Boltzmann
constant. To estimate the characteristic cooling time of each loop, the values of
Ne and Te, determined by the DEM analysis, and the loop length L are used.

Figure 7 shows a scatter plot of the ratio of cooling times versus temperature
for all the data points along the thirteen studied loops. The values of the ratio
τrad/τcond in Figure 7 can be directly compared with those shown in Figure
6 of L´opez Fuentes, Klimchuk, and Mandrini (2007). This comparison shows
that the characteristic cooling times obtained in this work are similar to those
found in previous loop observations done with TRACE (Winebarger, Warren,
and Mariska, 2003). Indeed, the mean value and standard deviation of τrad/τcond
for the AIA loops studied here are ≈ −1.5 and ≈ 0.5, respectively, while for the
loops studied with TRACE (Winebarger, Warren, and Mariska, 2003) they are
≈ −1.2 and ≈ 0.7, respectively.

Using Equations 13 and 14 we can also compute the characteristic cooling
times of the analysed loops, deﬁned as τcool = [1/τcond + 1/τrad]−1. The compu-
tation of this quantity for the loops in our set gives typical values of around 40
min. Notice that this is much shorter than the observed lifetime (≈ 2.5 hours)
of the loop studied in Section 3.2.

4.2. Impulsive Heating by Nanoﬂares

The results of the previous section indicate that the analysed loops are overdense
with respect to equilibrium solutions. As discussed in Section 1 these high densi-
ties can be expected if the loop plasma evolves in a highly dynamic scenario, as it
would be the case if it is heated by short impulsive events or nanoﬂares (see e.g.
Cargill, 1994). In the classical nanoﬂare model (Parker, 1988) coronal loops are

assumed to be formed by subresolution magnetic strands that are individually
heated by reconnection events. Observed loops are then the resolution-level man-
ifestation of sets of individual strands evolving more or less independently. The
apparently uniform evolution of the loop analysed in Section 3.2 is consistent
with this scenario. The sum of the radiation produced by several strands evolving
impulsively may contribute to the collective appearance of a quasi-static loop.

To explore this possibility, we use EBTEL to model the evolution of individual
strands heated by nanoﬂares. If we consider that an observed loop is the collective
manifestation of a set of strands, we can assume that at each instant of time the
mean thermal properties of the loop approximately coincide with the temporal
average of a typical individual strand. Thus, using EBTEL to model the evolution
of an individual strand heated by nanoﬂares we can compare its average coronal
temperature and density with the thermal properties of the observed loops,
as derived from the DEM analysis. The aim is to show the plausibility of the
nanoﬂare model to explain the high densities observed.

As in Section 4.1, the EBTEL inputs are the loop length and the heating
rate, not set constant in this case. The nanoﬂares are modelled with triangu-
lar functions of duration τ , with values in the range 50 − 250 s, and a total
volumetric energy in the range 5 − 20 erg cm−3. Since in the nanoﬂare model
the energy input proceeds from the photospheric motions that inject magnetic
energy via reconnection between neighbouring strands, τ is bounded by the solar
granulation characteristic time (≈ 300 s). Considering a typical subresolution
magnetic strand, with a circular cross-section of 100 km diameter and 100 Mm
length, the total injected energy lies in the nanoﬂare range ≈ 10−25 − 10−24 erg.

SOLA: ms_fanuevo_v3.tex; 20 November 2020; 1:31; p. 17

F.A. Nuevo et al.

Since our objective is to model a standard nanoﬂare in a typical strand, we
trigger the test nanoﬂare starting from initial conditions that can be considered
as characteristic during the evolution. Running a sequence of identical nanoﬂares
separated by a given time interval, we ﬁnd that after the third nanoﬂare all
following events exhibit identical evolution. We then use a sequence of three
consecutive nanoﬂares separated by a time interval τnf and we use the third one
as the test nanoﬂare. The ﬁrst two nanoﬂares are used to create standard initial
conditions for the strand. According to the criterion used to classify nanoﬂare
frequencies as high, intermediate or low, by L´opez Fuentes and Klimchuk (2015),
if the lapse between consecutive nanoﬂares is such that the temperature is
between 14% and 67% of its maximum value, the nanoﬂare frequency is con-
sidered intermediate. The nanoﬂare frequency in our simulations is deﬁned by
the time interval τnf . We set it by forcing that the temperature of the strand
does not decrease more than an 86% of its maximum value. Thus, the loop is not
signiﬁcantly cooled before the occurrence of the next nanoﬂare and we obtain
frequency values in the intermediate range.

To perform the DEM parametric technique we have used a set of EUV ﬁlters
with speciﬁc temperature sensitivity ranges. Inspecting the response functions
of the AIA channels (see Lemen et al., 2012, their Figure 13), we consider
the maximum response to be in the temperature range 0.03 – 2.27 MK. To be
observable by the three AIA channels, the range of temperatures of the coro-
nal plasma must signiﬁcantly overlap this range. Therefore, we let the third
nanoﬂare (the last one) to cool down over a time lapse tevol, until the loop reaches
temperatures within that range. Then, we compute the mean temperature and
density of the plasma during the time it remains in that range. We consider
that the temperature values determined from the DEM analysis represent the
average plasma conditions normally present in the analysed loops when they are
detected in the AIA channels.

The top panel of Figure 8 shows the temporal evolution of the heating power
of the test nanoﬂare indicating its duration, τ , and the evolution time, tevol.
The middle and bottom panels show the temporal evolution of the coronal mean
temperature and density over time. We compute the time-average temperature
and density along the time the plasma is in the temperature range 0.03 – 2.27
MK, indicated by a pink shaded area in the middle and bottom panels of the
ﬁgure.

We apply the procedure discussed above to the loops analysed in the previous
sections. We vary the model parameters in order to reproduce the thermal prop-
erties of the diﬀerent observed loops. Table 3 shows the EBTEL parameters used
for the diﬀerent cases: loop length, L; nanoﬂare energy, Enf ; nanoﬂare duration,
τ ; waiting time between heating events to prepare the initial conditions for the
test nanoﬂare, τnf ; and the evolution time, tevol, for the time averaging of the
plasma parameters. The last three columns of the table show a comparison of the
DEM results with the average density and temperature obtained with EBTEL,
using constant and impulsive heating. The results indicate that the model based
on nanoﬂare heating is more consistent with the observations. It can be seen that
longer loops need longer integration times and more energy input than shorter
ones in order to reproduce their plasma properties.

bottom panels show, respectively, the evolution of the strand averaged coronal-temperature
and density due to the nanoﬂare. The pink shaded areas indicate the plasma temperature and
density within the response range of the used AIA channels.

For each analysed loop, Figure 9 shows the loop-averaged temperature (top

the EBTEL model (squares). In the top panel, green and blue areas represent
the standard deviation, σ, of the DEM electron temperature and the DEM
thermal width ,WT , respectively. In the bottom panel, pink areas indicate the
standard deviation of the DEM electron density. The squares correspond to the
time-average plasma properties obtained with EBTEL using variable heating.
In both panels, the error bars represent the standard deviation of the EBTEL
values during the temporal evolution of the simulation. Note that in most cases
the standard deviation of the temperature from the EBTEL model is of the
same order or larger than WT of the DEM analysis indicating that the model
reproduces the degree of multithermality obtained from the observations with
the DEM technique. In the case of density, we also indicate with violet bullets
the time-average density obtained with EBTEL using a constant heating rate.

In most cases we ﬁnd that the loop-averaged plasma properties obtained from
the DEM analysis and with the EBTEL model, using impulsive heating, are
consistent. In the case of the density we observe a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
both heating scenarios. Constant heating produces densities one or two orders
of magnitude smaller than those obtained with heating by nanoﬂares. Then, we
conclude that the second scenario, heating by impulsive events, better reproduces
the plasma properties of the loops analysed here.

5. Conclusions

We identify and analyse 13 AR coronal loops observed with SDO/AIA around
the time of their maximum brightness. We develop and apply a technique that
reconstructs the electron density and temperature distribution along the loops.
We combine parametric DEM analysis, including background subtraction, with
LFFF extrapolations of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld to determine the 3D
geometry of the loops. Other existing DEM methods that work with multi-
channel EUV image sets (see e.g. Cheung et al. 2015, or Del Zanna and Mason
2018, for a review of EUV diagnostic methods) are designed to produce 2D DEM
maps.

Figure 9. Comparison of loop-averaged temperature (upper panel) and density (lower panel)
obtained with the parametric DEM method and the mean temperature and density obtained
with EBTEL. In the top panels, stars indicate the loop-averaged temperature derived from the
DEM. Green and blue areas represent, respectively, the standard deviation and temperature
width distribution from the DEM analysis. Blue squares correspond to the time-averaged
temperatures obtained with the EBTEL model using impulsive heating. Error bars indicate the
standard deviation of the modelled temperatures during the plasma evolution within the AIA
response range. The lower panel shows, in pink, the same corresponding means and averages
for the density. Violet bullets represent the time-averaged density obtained with EBTEL using
a constant heating rate.

The procedure developed in this work is designed to speciﬁcally study EUV
bright loops, enabling the background subtraction in a practical and intuitive
way. This procedure provides the intrinsic emission of the loop, from which
we can derive the local DEM at each point along a bright loop. Combined
with 3D magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations, the method allows reconstructing the 3D
distribution of the electron density and temperature along EUV bright loops.
It is worth to note that the background emission can contribute with as much
as 70 % of the total observed intensity at a pixel of a EUV bright loop (see,
e.g., L´opez Fuentes, Klimchuk, and D´emoulin 2006, Aschwanden and Boerner
2011). Since we are just interested in the intrinsic loop emission and not in DEM
distributions over larger active region areas, we consider that the method used
here is more appropriate for this kind of analysis.

In this work we use a LFFF model to extrapolate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld.
A non-linear force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model, which provides a better representa-
tion of small-scale highly twisted structures, can be also used with our method.
However, in all the examples we have studied, loops are of intermediate scale-size
and very low twist. Under these conditions, LFFF and NLFFF models provide
very similar results (see, e.g, Mandrini et al. 2014) with the advantage that a
LFFF extrapolation is computationally much less demanding and much faster.

The latter is particularly convenient since our aim is to model a single particular
observed loop, and to do so we need to run several models with diﬀerent α values
until we obtain the best match between a computed ﬁeld line and the observed
structure.

We obtain error estimations, ∆Tm, based on the eﬀect of the background
subtraction on the density and temperature. As an indicator of the temperature
inhomogeneity of the loops (i.e. their multithermality) we consider the width,
WT , of the thermal distribution associated to the DEM. We ﬁnd that WT is
systematically larger than ∆Tm and conclude that the studied loops are multi-
thermal; This suggests that the loops are formed by strands or sub-loops with
diﬀerent temperatures. We also ﬁnd that the mean of the temperature distribu-
tion on each analysed loop point, Tm, does not vary signiﬁcantly along the loop,
being its standard deviation 5 − 20% of its mean, (cid:104)Tm(cid:105). Furthermore, (cid:104)Tm(cid:105) is
comparable to WT , whose mean is 0.32 MK for all the analysed loop points.
This implies that the temperature variation along each loop and among loops is
comparable to the thermal amplitude associated to the DEM distribution.

For one of the loops in our set, observed in AR 11130, we perform a temporal
evolution analysis by applying the DEM parametric method on all the AIA
images along the time during which the loop is observable, i.e. for all images
in which the loop intrinsic intensity is high enough to distinguish it from the
background. Once again, we ﬁnd that the density and temperature do not vary
substantially in time. The reconstructed values of Ne and Te along the loop
evolution are similar to the instantaneous values obtained for the rest of the
loops in our set. This suggests that all loops have been observed at a similar
stage of their evolution, which is their mid lifetime, and that the obtained Ne
and Te values are typical of EUV loops observed with SDO/AIA.

It is of course not surprising that these loops are in the temperature range
in which the AIA channels have their maximum response; however, what makes
them interesting regarding the structure and dynamics of the solar corona is their
apparent spatial coherence along times that are longer than the characteristic
cooling times. The question arises if the loops are constantly heated at these
temperatures during their evolution or if they are the manifestation of processes
involving broader temperature ranges, i.e. if they represent the cooling phase of
structures evolving from hotter temperatures.

In order to test the previous possibilities, we compare our results with the
hydrodynamic model EBTEL (Klimchuk, Patsourakos, and Cargill, 2008). First,
we consider that the loops are in quasi-static equilibrium and apply a constant
heating producing temperatures consistent with our observations. We ﬁnd that
in this case the predicted densities are too low compared with the observations.
As we discussed in Section 1, previous studies have shown that EUV loops
are overdense with respect to quasi-static equilibrium solutions (Aschwanden,
Schrijver, and Alexander, 2001; Winebarger, Warren, and Mariska, 2003). This
overdensity can be explained if the heating mechanism is impulsive. However, im-
pulsive heating at the footpoints predicts loops in thermal non-equilibrium with
important density asymmetries and temperature gradients (Klimchuk, Karpen,
and Antiochos, 2010; Lionello et al., 2013). This is not the case of the loops stud-
ied here. It has been proposed that multithermal and overdense loops would be

SOLA: ms_fanuevo_v3.tex; 20 November 2020; 1:31; p. 22

3D Resconstruction of Loop Density and Temperature

more consistent with impulsive heating along the coronal part of the loop (e.g. in
the form of nanoﬂares, see Klimchuk 2015). To test this possibility we model, for
each of the observed loops, the evolution of single strands heated by nanoﬂares.
We ﬁnd densities and temperatures that reproduce the observed values. We
conclude that this heating scenario explains fairly well all the characteristics of
the plasma in the observed loops: density values, temperature distributions, and
temporal evolution.
