ABSTRACT
We explore the possibility that the recently discovered white dwarf pulsar AR Sco ac-
quired its high spin and magnetic ﬁeld due to repeated episodes of accretion and spin-
down. An accreting white dwarf can lead to a larger mass and consequently a smaller
radius thus causing an enhanced rotation period and magnetic ﬁeld. This spinning mag-
netic white dwarf temporarily can inhibit accretion, spin down, and, eventually, the
accretion can start again due to the shrinking of the binary period by gravitational ra-
diation. A repeat of the above cycle can eventually lead to a high magnetic ﬁeld white
dwarf, recently postulated to be the reason for over-luminous type Ia supernovae. We
also point out that these high magnetic ﬁeld spinning white dwarfs are attractive sites
for gravitational radiation.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, we had shown that the mass-radius (M −R) relation
of Chandrasekhar has to be suitably modiﬁed in the case of
highly magnetised white dwarfs, namely B-WDs, leading to
signiﬁcantly higher mass limit for white dwarfs. By means
of both analytical calculations and numerical modelling, we
carried out a systematic study of how a strong magnetic ﬁeld
aﬀects the structure and properties of the underlying white
dwarf in a variety of ways. We progressed from constructing
simplistic to more rigorous and self-consistent models (see,
e.g., Das & Mukhopadhyay 2013; Das, Mukhopadhyay & Rao
2013; Subramanian & Mukhopadhyay 2015; Mukhopadhyay
& Rao 2016). After our initiation, other independent groups
also examined the implications of high magnetic ﬁelds for the
mass-radius relation of white dwarfs (e.g. Liu, Zhang & Wen
2014; Bera & Bhattacharya 2016; Belyaev et al. 2015; Franzon
& Schramm 2015).

The prime motivation of the B-WD model was to ex-
plain the peculiar over-luminous type Ia supernovae (Das
& Mukhopadhyay 2015). The question, however, remained
about the mechanism by which white dwarfs can attain high
magnetic ﬁelds. The related question is to explore the obser-
vational consequences of the existence of a large number of
B-WDs and proto-B-WDs. Since an increase in the mass of
white dwarf leads to a decrease in its radius, the mechanism
of accretion leading to an increase in its magnetic ﬁeld by ﬂux
freezing, and hence leading to B-WDs, was also qualitatively
explored to explain some other observed phenomena. They
are soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray
pulsars (AXPs), particularly the ones exhibiting high X-ray
luminosities (Mukhopadhyay & Rao 2016) which posit prob-

lem on the neutron star based model (see, e.g., Mereghetti
2012), and some white dwarf pulsars e.g. GCRT J1745-3009
(Zhang & Harding 2000; Mukhopadhyay & Rao 2016).

The recent discovery of a rotating magnetised white
dwarf (Marsh et al. 2016) in AR Scorpii (AR Sco) demon-
strates that some white dwarfs do acquire high magnetic
ﬁeld and high spin period. The evolutionary scenario of AR
Sco, though not fully explored (see, however, Beskrovnaya &
Ikhsanov 2016) in the literature, could involve the scenario
envisaged for the generation of high magnetic ﬁeld in B-WDs
(accretion resulting in smaller radius). In this paper, we ex-
plore this possibility and point out that AR Sco appears to
be a very suitable candidate to be a seed B-WD.

In the next section, we discuss the M − R relations of
moderately magnetised B-WDs, with surface (and central)
magnetic ﬁelds similar to those inferred for AR Sco. Subse-
quently, in §3 we will discuss the possible time evolution of
AR Sco and how being in a M − R trajectory of moderately
magnetised white dwarfs, it is expected to switch to a M − R
trajectory of B-WDs. We will also comment on the possible
emission and detection of gravitational waves from it and in
general B-WDs in §4, apart from the fact that the glitches
and outbursts seen in SGRs/AXPs can be explained in the
B-WD premises. Finally we end with a conclusion in §5.

2 MODERATELY MAGNETIZED WHITE

DWARFS: PULSAR AR SCO

AR Sco has been shown to be a rotating magnetised white
dwarf (Marsh et al. 2016). This is argued based on various
properties of it, e.g. increasing optical ﬂux detected in radio,

higher spin-down power compared to electromagnetic radia-
tion, no obvious sign of accretion, broadband spectrum char-
acteristic of synchrotron radiation requiring relativistic elec-
trons etc. The underlying white dwarf/cool star binary sys-
tem emits radiation from X-ray to radio, which is pulsating
in brightness on a period P = 1.97 min and period derivative
˙P ∼ 4 × 10−13 sec sec−1. The maximum and mean luminosi-
ties of AR Sco are ∼ 6.3 × 1032 erg s−1 and ∼ 1.7 × 1032
erg s−1 respectively. The mass M of the white dwarf inferred
to be in the range 0.8 − 1.29M⊙, where M⊙ is the mass of
Sun. For the corresponding radius R = 7000 − 3200 km, the
spin-down power turns out to be L ˙ν ∼ 1.5 × 1032−33 erg s−1,
which is adequate to explain its luminosity mentioned above.
However, a neutron star based model with its typical mass
and radius, L ˙ν turns out to be much smaller ∼ 1028 erg s−1,
which rules it out to be a spinning down neutron star. In the
framework of an accreting compact object (which indeed does
not have any sign in it), a neutron star requires the accretion
rate ˙M ∼ 10−14M⊙Yr−1, while a white dwarf needs to have a
much higher rate ˙M ∼ 1.3×10−11M⊙Yr−1 which is very high
to see the Doppler-broadband emission lines from accretion,
but AR Sco shows features from M-star.

q

Keeping all the features in mind, AR Sco is conﬁrmed
to be a white dwarf rather than a neutron star, which quali-
ﬁes it to be the ﬁrst ever detected white dwarf radio pulsar.
Its surface magnetic ﬁeld can be estimated by assuming the
standard dipole radiation from rotating magnetised compact
objects (e.g. Mukhopadhyay & Rao 2016, see §3 for details)
5c3M P ˙P /4π2R4 sin2 α ∼ 6 × 108−9 G with the
as Bs ∼
angle between the spin and magnetic axes α = 90 degree,
where c is the speed of light. However, for smaller α, which
cannot be ruled out (see, e.g., Tong & Xu 2012), Bs could ex-
ceed 1011 G. As a range of mass is inferred for AR Sco from
observation which corresponds to a range of radius, a range
of Bs is inferred. Hence, central ﬁeld Bc could even be 1014
G. Such Bs and Bc could inﬂuence stellar structure due to
the eﬀect of magnetic pressure, however are small enough to
practically aﬀect electron-degenerate matter. Hence, Chan-
drasekhar’s equation of state (Chandrasekhar 1935) would
suﬃce.

In the presence of stronger magnetic ﬁelds, even for
Bc ∼ 1014 G as is expected in AR Sco, white dwarfs’ struc-
ture and M − R relation may deviate from that of Chan-
drasekhar’s theory. In fact, such white dwarfs (and B-WDs)
need not necessarily be spherical, depending on the ﬁeld val-
ues. Such B-WDs were explored in past by us and other
groups (Das & Mukhopadhyay 2015; Franzon & Schramm
2015; Bera & Bhattacharya 2016), when the focus was mainly
to investigate how massive B-WDs could be in the presence
of various kinds of ﬁelds. For the present purpose, when ﬁeld
magnitudes are rather restricted from observational inference,
we construct M − R relations of B-WDs based on publicly
available LORENE code1 (Bocquet et al. 1995; Bonazzola
et al. 1993). By construction, LORENE describes compact

stars, in the general relativistic framework, having purely
poloidal ﬁelds. Such B-WDs could be oblate, depending on
ﬁeld strength, with a smaller equatorial radius (Re) compared
to their weakly magnetic counterparts (see, e.g., Subrama-
nian & Mukhopadhyay 2015), unlike toroidally dominated B-
WDs which are prolate spheroids. Their mass is also restricted
to ∼ 2M⊙, unlike their toroidally dominated counterparts
(Das & Mukhopadhyay 2015; Subramanian & Mukhopad-
hyay 2015). However, such massive B-WDs are possible for
Bc & 3 × 1014 G. As mentioned above, ﬁelds in AR Sco are
smaller.

Figure 1 describes the M − R relation obtained by
LORENE keeping the ﬁeld restriction in AR Sco in mind. We
also choose the star to be rotating with period 1.95 min, as is
for the white dwarf in AR Sco. In order to obtain a solution,
hence M and R, by LORENE, ﬁrst we assign a central den-
sity (ρc) and a certain parameterisation of the magnetic ﬁelds
(and hence current), namely “charge function”. Each M − R
curve’s the sequence of top-most to bottom-most points fol-
low the sequence of increasing ρc for a given charge function.
Now with the change of charge function, we obtain the family
of M − R relation, shown in Fig. 1. For a given charge func-
tion, increasing ρc corresponds to increasing Bs and Bc for
self-consistency2, as given in Fig. 1 caption. The readers inter-
ested to understand more details are referred to the LORENE
manual. As seen in Fig. 1, generally M decreases as ρc de-
creases along with increasing R for low (or non) magnetic
white dwarfs, which bring them in the very similar trend, ex-
cept for the top two curves. The maximum ρc, for complete-
ness, is chosen to be 2×1011 g cm−3 which leads to a unstable
zone in the M − R curve where M further decreases with in-
creasing ρc. Upto ρc ∼ 2 × 1010 g cm−3, however, the M − R
curve remains stable. The chosen minimum ρc is 6.3 × 106
g cm−3, except for top two curves where they are 2 × 107 g
cm−3 (top but one) and 1.3 × 108 g cm−3 (top-most). For
Bs > 2 × 1012, i.e. for top two curves, the trend changes. This
is because at lower densities, gravitational power decreases
rendering a bigger size of white dwarfs which however would
be massive due to the additional eﬀects of stronger magnetic
pressure unlike the nonmagnetic (low magnetic) cases. For
Bs < 1011 G and Bc < 1012 G, M − R relations are practi-
cally same as of non-magnetic white dwarfs.

However, Fig. 1 shows that in the mass range 0.8 −
1.29M⊙, the increase in radius due to such stronger ﬁelds
could be at most a factor of 1.6 only which would render
about a factor of 2.6 increase only in L ˙ν . Hence, apparently
the ﬁelds in AR Sco seem not to be playing any practical role
in determining its mass and radius currently, which eventu-
ally controls its observed luminosity. Nevertheless, note im-
portantly that all the inferences are based on LORENE with
purely poloidal ﬁeld geometry, which need not be the general
conﬁguration.

would change for the very high ﬁeld stars.

of mass in a CV and in the following we sketch a tentative
scheme of repeated episodes of mass accretion as a reason for
the high magnetic ﬁeld and spin rate in AR Sco. This mecha-
nism can quite possibly lead to a B-WD. An accretion driven
scenario for the spin-up of AR Sco has been considered by
Beskrovnaya & Ikhsanov (2016) and here we present a com-
prehensive picture of the increase of mass, spin, and magnetic
ﬁled in white dwarfs, which might eventually lead to a B-WD.
It is important to note the observational evidence for transi-
tions between rotation/spin-powered and accretion-powered
phases in a binary millisecond pulsar (Papitto et al. 2013) —
further strongly motivating us to explore similar possibility
in the case of a white dwarf pulsar.

We assume that AR Sco actually was a binary which ac-
cretes mass from its companion. As a result of mass gain, its
gravitational power might have increased rendering decreas-
ing radius and from the ﬂux freezing increasing of its any
initial magnetic ﬁelds. On the other hand, due to the conser-
vation of angular momentum, its angular velocity and hence
spin frequency varies with the change of mass and radius,
whether decreasing or increasing, that depends on the trend
of moment of inertia (i.e. M R2), as depicted in Fig. 2 (will be
discussed below). In addition, at some point, accretion might
also have been inhibited temporarily due to appreciable in-
crease in ﬁelds creating signiﬁcant outward force to oppose
infall (this also could be due to its entering in the propeller
phase, see, e.g., Ghosh 1995). As a result, it would behave
as a spin-powered pulsar (we interchangeably use the phrase
rotation-powered and spin-powered) with increasing spin pe-
riod Ps and with time Ps turns out to be what we see today.
After & 108 Yr (as veriﬁed in §3, Fig. 4), due to con-
tinuous radio emission, its angular velocity as well as ﬁelds
would decay signiﬁcantly (as is the case for a rotating dipole,
see, e.g., Jackson 1999) and eventually radiation would stop.
However, at this stage it would start accreting again. More-
over, because of the shrinkage in the binary system resulting
from gravitational wave emission, the white dwarf by this
time would acquire stronger gravitational power to accrete
matter from the companion more eﬃciently. A simple esti-
mate (Bertschinger & Taylor 2015) argues that the time ∆t
taken for the decrease of separation between white dwarf of
mass M1 and its companion of mass M2 from r1 to r2 is given
by

∆t =

where G is Newton’s gravitation constant. Therefore, for
M1 = 4 × 1033 gm, M2 = 2 × 1033 gm, r1 = 5 × 105 km
and r2 = 105 km, ∆t turns out to be below 108 Yr and hence
signiﬁcant binary shrinkage is justiﬁed during the repeated
episodes of mass accretion and spin-powered phases. However,
such a white dwarf (might turn out to be a B-WD candidate)
would also radiate gravitational wave due to its non-spherical
shape as a consequence of magnetic eﬀects and spinning na-
ture (as will be discussed more quantitatively in §4).

Hence, after restarting accretion, the whole cycle de-
scribed above would repeat again and again rendering much

3 POSSIBLE EVOLUTION OF AR SCO

The present high values of magnetic ﬁeld and spin rate of
AR Sco could be either due to their high natal values or due
to an increase in these values during its binary evolution.
Since, as a class, white dwarfs are not known to have high
spin and magnetic ﬁelds at their birth (unlike neutron stars),
most likely, AR Sco acquired its present values of magnetic
ﬁeld and spin during its binary evolution. The class of objects
with white dwarf as a primary and a late type low mass star
as a secondary is known as cataclysmic variables (CV) (see
Warner 1995, for a review) and, in Das, Mukhopadhyay &
Rao 2013, we have postulated the concept of a white dwarf
increasing its mass and magnetic ﬁeld by accretion, eventu-
ally leading to a B-WD. There are, indeed, evidences to sug-
gest that white dwarfs in CV conﬁguration have signiﬁcantly
higher magnetic ﬁelds than detached binaries (Liebert et al.
2015) and that white dwarfs in CVs are more massive than the
expected canonical values (Zorotovic, Schreiber & G¨ansicke
2011). The single degenerate scenario of the production of
type Ia supernova postulates the rapid accretion of matter
onto a white dwarf (Whelan & Iben 1973).

The detailed investigation of the process of accretion and
the increase of mass in CVs, however, faces several diﬃcul-
ties like accretion leading to nova eruptions (thus decreasing
the white dwarf mass) and the accumulated shells erupting
and getting ejected. Detailed calculations show that thermal-
timescale mass transfers are not eﬀective in increasing the
masses of white dwarfs in CVs (see, e.g., Liu & Li 2016). The
discovery of a fast rotating and high magnetic ﬁeld white
dwarf in AR Sco opens up the possibility of episodic increase

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

4

stronger ﬁelds eventually. Note that once the binary shrinkage
takes place signiﬁcantly, the decay phase of angular velocity
and magnetic ﬁelds gets abolished and frequency and ﬁelds
both would start increasing uninterruptedly, until the com-
panion is exhausted. As a consequence, the underlying white
dwarf would not follow the theory of non-magnetic white
dwarfs and would cross the Chandrasekhar’s limit. Eventu-
ally, it would deviate from Chandrasekhar’s M − R trajec-
tory to B-WD’s trajectory, as demonstrated earlier by Das,
Mukhopadhyay & Rao (2013).

Based on a toy model, the above speculative proposition
can be examined. There are two phases: accretion-powered
and rotation-powered. There are three conservation laws con-
trolling the accretion-powered phase: linear and angular mo-
menta conservation and conservation of magnetic ﬂux, around
the stellar surface, which could be closer to the inner edge of
accretion disc depending on the ﬁeld strength, given by

lΩ(t)2R(t) =

GM (t)
R(t)2 ,
I(t)Ω(t) = constant,
Bs(t)R(t)2 = constant,

(2)

where l takes care of inequality due to dominance of grav-
itational force over the centrifugal force in general (so that
terms with pressure and magnetic ﬁelds are parameterized in
l; larger the value of l, stronger the eﬀects of pressure and
ﬁelds over rotation assumed), I is the moment of inertia of
star and Ω is the angular velocity of the star which includes
the additional contribution acquired due to accretion as well.
Solving equations in (2) simultaneously, we obtain the time
evolution of radius (or mass), magnetic ﬁeld and angular ve-
locity during accretion. Accretion stops when

If the magnetic ﬁeld is of dipole nature,

˙Ω ∝ Ω3 for a
ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld (see, e.g., Mukhopadhyay & Rao 2016),
where over-dot implies time derivative. Generalizing it, for the
present purpose we assume ˙Ω = kΩn with k being constant.
Therefore, during the phase of spin-powered pulsar (when ac-
cretion inhibits, even temporarily), without having explicit
knowledge of ﬁeld geometry, time evolution of angular veloc-
ity and surface magnetic ﬁeld are given by

where Ω0 is the angular velocity at the beginning of spin-
powered phase (when accretion just stops) at time t = t0. k
is ﬁxed in order to constrain Bs at t = t0, at the beginning of
ﬁrst spin-powered phase, which is known from the evolution
of ﬁelds in the preceding accretion-powered phase. Note that
n = m = 3 corresponds to dipole ﬁeld, hence m represents
the deviation from dipolar ﬁeld particularly for n = 3.

Figure 2 shows a couple of sample possible evolutions of
angular velocity and magnetic ﬁeld with mass. Note that the
mass of star is varying with time (shown in Fig. 4 below) and
hence considered in the horizontal axis to describe the evolu-
˙M in all the accretion-powered phases is chosen to be
tion.
10−8M⊙Yr−1, which is slightly higher than that of a typical
intermediate polar, but an order of magnitude lower ˙M would
also suﬃce our purpose. Other parameters, mentioned in the
Fig. 2 caption, are some of their typical representative val-
ues. In both the cases, initial larger Ω with accretion is seen
to be dropped signiﬁcantly during spin-powered phase (when
accretion stops and hence no change of mass), followed by a
phase of its increasing trend. The case with solid line shows a
few such phases/cycles with dip: they are determined by the
choice of n and m. Similar trend is seen in surface magnetic
ﬁeld proﬁles with a sharp increasing trend (with value ∼ 1011
G) at the last cycle. This corresponds to the increase of Bc
as well leading to a B-WD. At the end of evolution, it could
be left out as a super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf and/or a
SGR/AXP candidate with a higher spin frequency. Of course,
they are just representative samples and they may depend on
many other factors and hence they apparently do not match
exactly with what is expected to happen in AR Sco itself.

Figure 3 shows how the M − R trajectory with the in-
crease of ﬁelds could deviate from Chandrasekhar’s to B-
WD’s ending with an eventual larger limiting mass. This
is similar to what was argued earlier (Das, Mukhopadhyay
& Rao 2013) in the presence of even stronger ﬁelds. With
the increase of mass due to accretion, radius decreases which
leads to the increase of magnetic ﬁelds assuming conservation
of magnetic ﬂux. Increasing magnetic ﬁelds however creates
increasing outward pressure which is able to oppose stronger
gravitational ﬁeld even at lower density. This eventually leads
to massive super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs even below
ρc = 2 × 1010 gm cm−3. Figure 4 conﬁrms that the above
mentioned increase of mass ∆M , with ˙M ∼ 10−8M⊙ Yr−1,
would complete in ∼ 109 Yr, which is quite legitimate given
the current age of Universe. It is clear by comparing Fig. 4
with Fig. 2 that the dip of Ω and Bs in the latter corresponds
to the sharp increase of t in the former, as in the spin-powered
phase there is no change of mass.

As indicated in Fig. 2 qualitatively, repeating the cycles
described above will reveal lower and lower Ps apart from
higher and higher ﬁelds, ending up forming a fast spinning
B-WD, which might behave as a SGR/AXP. For quantitative
estimates, one should explore more rigorous model. Indeed,
several SGRs/AXPs have been argued to be fast spinning
B-WDs and those sources are successfully explained without
invoking extraordinarily high unobserved yet magnetic ﬁelds
(Mukhopadhyay & Rao 2016). As B-WDs are expected to be
about 100 pc away, many AR Sco like objects are expected to
be seen in future astronomical missions like Square Kilometer
Array (SKA).

STAR-QUAKE

Neutron stars are already proposed to be the candidates of
continuous gravitational wave signal due to their quadrupo-
lar nature. Such a signal is possible to emit by a tri-axial
compact star rotating around a principle axis of inertia due
to its quadrupole moment characterized by the amplitude

As rotating B-WDs are ellipsoid and could rotate faster
than their standard counter-parts, they also could be plausi-
ble candidates for continuous gravitational wave signal (see
also Heyl 2000; Franzon & Schramm 2017). A B-WD with
mass ∼ 2M⊙, polar radius ∼ 700 km, Ps ∼ 1 sec (Subrama-
nian & Mukhopadhyay 2015), ǫ ∼ 5 × 10−4 and at ∼ 100 pc
away from us would produce h0 ∼ 10−22, which is within the
sensitivity of the Einstein@Home search for early Laser Inter-
ferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) S5 data
(Palomba et al. 2013). However, a ﬁrm conﬁrmation of gravi-
tational wave emission can be provided by detectors more sen-
sitive in their frequency range like Deci-hertz Interferometer
Gravitational wave Observatory or Big Bang Observer (DE-
CIGO/BBO) (Yagi & Seto 2011). In fact, if the B-WD’s polar
radius is ∼ 2000 km with Ps ∼ 10 sec and other parameters
intact, even DECIGO/BBO can detect it with h0 ∼ 10−23.
Nevertheless, high magnetic ﬁeld rotating white dwarfs ap-
proaching B-WDs would be common and it is possible that
such white dwarfs of radius ∼ 7000 km, Ps ∼ 20 sec and
d ∼ 10 pc will have a h0 & 10−22 which is detectable by
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) (Moore, Cole &

realised based on rigorous theory.

Also if observed spin-down is totally due to gravitational
wave emission, the absolute upper limit of signal is (Palomba

slightly lower compared to that of AR Sco).

After signiﬁcant accretion, the gravitational power may
dominate the centrifugal eﬀects of the core signiﬁcantly to
pull it to a less oblate shape due to signiﬁcant decrease in ra-
dius, thereby stressing it. The release of such stresses would
lead to a sudden decrease in the moment of inertia and, cor-
respondingly, by the conservation of angular momentum it
would suddenly rotate fast such that

For a 2M⊙ B-WD with R ∼ 1000 km, ∆EG ∼ 5×1051∆Ps/Ps
and ∆Erot ∼ −1.6 × 1051∆Ps/P 3
s , hence rotational en-
ergy could be explained by available gravitational energy,
particularly for Ps ∼ 1 sec, and observed ﬂares/gaint-
ﬂares/outbursts in SGRs/AXPs of energy 1043 − 1046 ergs
could be explained as star quakes.

5 CONCLUSION

The idea of B-WD is in the literature for quite sometime
(see also Ostriker & Hartwick 1968), however without any
direct proof of their existence. The major motivation of in-
troducing B-WD by us was to explain peculiar over-luminous
type Ia supernovae. Later on, other sources like SGRs/AXPs,
a white dwarf pulsar were also explained under the B-WD
premise. Nevertheless, there is no direct observational evi-
dence for them yet. Of course, due to the small size, they
were speculated to be of low luminosity (Das & Mukhopad-
hyay 2014). Also, as total gravitational force of B-WDs does
not appear to change signiﬁcantly (for similar radius, there
may be about 50% increase of mass), in the presence of high
magnetic ﬁeld, thermal pressure and hence luminosity may be
decreased (which however needs to be checked in a rigorous
calculation).

We have explored the possibility of AR Sco being the
seed of B-WD. Although observed data of AR Sco currently
at hand do not seem to violate Chandrasekhar’s theory, we
have shown that weak magnetic ﬁelds in the underlying white
dwarf may enhance during accretion, which may deviate it
from Chandrasekhar’s M − R trajectory and leading to a
spinning B-WD in the life-time of Universe. This is however
an exploratory study based on a simple model, which should
be re-investigated in detail in future.

We have also touched upon the issue of gravitational
wave possibly emitted from B-WDs. While LISA appears to
be very appropriate to detect them, even LIGO S5 may do so.
All in all, the present work is the ﬁrst attempt to unfold the is-
sue of direct observational evidences of B-WDs. Although not
evident yet, it indicates a plausible path and future prospect
of their direct detection.
