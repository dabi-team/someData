ABSTRACT

Aims. The catalog of Stars With ExoplanETs (SWEET-Cat) was originally introduced in 2013. Since then many more exoplanets have
been conﬁrmed, increasing signiﬁcantly the number of host stars listed there. A crucial step toward a comprehensive understanding
of these new worlds is the precise and homogeneous characterization of their host stars. Better spectroscopic stellar parameters along
with new results from Gaia eDR3 provide updated and precise parameters for the discovered planets. A new version of the catalog,
whose homogeneity in the derivation of the parameters is key to unraveling star–planet connections, is available to the community.
Methods. We made use of high-resolution spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or collected through public
archives. The spectroscopic stellar parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES
and MOOG (ARES+MOOG) as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. We re-derived parameters for the stars in the catalog using
better quality spectra and/or using the most recent versions of the codes. Moreover, the new SWEET-Cat table can now be more
easily combined with the planet properties listed both at the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive to
perform statistical analyses of exoplanets. We also made use of the recent GAIA eDR3 parallaxes and respective photometry to derive
consistent and accurate surface gravity values for the host stars.
Results. We increased the number of stars with homogeneous parameters by more than 40% (from 645 to 928). We reviewed and up-
dated the metallicity distributions of stars hosting planets with diﬀerent mass regimes comparing the low-mass planets (< 30M⊕) with
the high-mass planets. The new data strengthen previous results showing the possible trend in the metallicity-period-mass diagram
for low-mass planets.

1. Introduction

Studies of planetary systems have grown immensely in recent
decades following the ﬁrst detections of exoplanets orbiting
solar-type stars (e.g., Mayor & Queloz 1995) and the thousands
of exoplanets detected since. More interesting than the fantas-
tic increase rate of discoveries is the surprising vast diversity of
exoplanets present in the Galaxy, revealed by dedicated search
surveys using the radial-velocity (RV) and transit techniques.

These discoveries provide crucial constraints for the exhaus-
tive understanding of planet formation and evolution, based ini-
tially on our knowledge of the Solar System alone (e.g., Ehren-
reich et al. 2020; Lillo-Box et al. 2020; Armstrong et al. 2020).
The reasonable assumption that the same source material
forms the planets and host star(s) within a given planetary system
has led researchers to focus on a quest for possible correlations

between the characteristics of the host stars and the presence of
their planets. One of the ﬁrst observational results to become evi-
dent in this regard was that massive Jupiter-like planets are much
more frequent around metal-rich stars (e.g., Santos et al. 2004;
Valenti & Fischer 2005). Later on, with further discoveries of
lower mass planets, this planet–metallicity correlation was found
to be nonexistent for small or low-mass planets (e.g., Sousa et al.
2008; Ghezzi et al. 2010; Schlaufman & Laughlin 2011; Buch-
have et al. 2012; Buchhave & Latham 2015; Kutra et al. 2020).
Several works have focused on other aspects, such as plane-
tary system architectures (Adibekyan 2019; Dawson & Johnson
2018), and planet frequency, and its dependence on other stellar
parameters like the stellar mass (e.g., Mortier et al. 2013). These
are a small representation of the statistical studies performed fo-
cusing on the potential correlations between the star’s proprieties
and its hosted planets. Detailed knowledge of the nature of indi-

vidual stars is crucial for the thorough understanding of plane-
tary systems currently being characterized by CHEOPS (Benz
et al. 2021) and ESPRESSO (Pepe et al. 2021), and for prepar-
ing the selection of targets for future missions such as ARIEL
(Tinetti et al. 2018; Brucalassi et al. 2021), and PLATO (Rauer
et al. 2014). SWEET-Cat is a catalog with homogeneous spec-
troscopic parameters for planet hosts, with near-full complete-
ness for the RV detected planets; it was introduced by Santos
et al. (2013). To increase the sample of stellar hosts with homo-
geneous spectroscopic parameters, our group has continuously
worked on SWEET-Cat, releasing several updates to the com-
munity (e.g., Sousa et al. 2015b; Andreasen et al. 2017; Sousa
et al. 2018).

This work presents a signiﬁcant upgrade to SWEET-Cat1.
It consists of the addition of 283 new planet hosts, the inclu-
sion of new data relevant for the characterization of the planet-
host stars, the inclusion of the link to the NASA archive exo-
planet database2 (Akeson et al. 2013), in addition to the already
existing link to the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia3 (Schnei-
der et al. 2011), and the rederivation of spectroscopic parame-
ters from better quality or recent spectra using the latest updated
codes developed by our group. The following sections describe
all the work performed for the new version of SWEET-Cat. Sec-
tion 2 describes the spectroscopic data compilation for the cat-
alog. Section 3 presents how the spectroscopic parameters are
derived, and compares the latest parameters with our older re-
sults and others in the literature. We also describe how we use
the GAIA eDR3 to estimate accurate surface gravities for our
planet-host stars. In Section 4 we present the new catalog con-
tents and how we use the coordinates to link our catalog with
the exoplanet.eu and the NASA archive. In Section 5 we review
and update planet–star correlations discussed previously in the
literature. Finally, in Section 6 we present the summary of our
work.

2. Spectroscopic data

2.1. Selection of host stars for SWEET-Cat

We kept the same constraints of previous catalog versions to
include the planet host stars in SWEET-Cat. First, we search
for the conﬁrmed planets in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclope-
dia and selected only the detected by Radial Velocity, Primary
Transit, and Astrometry methods. Second, we cross-match their
host stars with the stars in SWEET-Cat and include the missing
hosts, while removing the stars that no longer had a planet con-
ﬁrmed status. The same procedure is performed with the NASA
exoplanet archive to add the conﬁrmed host stars missing in the
Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia. We include the database source
in the information of all host stars (see Section 4 for details).

2.2. Spectra from public archival data

The ESO archive4 is the main source of reduced spectral public
data for SWEET-Cat. We used the astroquery.eso5 submodule
to search for the required data in the ESO archive. We note that
a small fraction of the spectra belonging to our UVES programs

had private status at the moment of compilation (106.20ZM.001,
105.203J.001, 0103.C-0027, 0102.C-0226, 0101.C-0049).

The compilation of data prioritizes high-resolution and high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra for each host star. We selected
the data from the FEROS, HARPS, and UVES spectrographs,
all with R > 400006. In most cases we downloaded more than
one spectrum per star to achieve a higher S/N by combining
them. We avoided very low S/N spectra (S/N<15) due to low-
quality individual exposures that could add relatively low signal
compared with the noise. We also did not select very high S/N
spectra (e.g., S/N>550 for HARPS, S/N>1000 for UVES7) ei-
ther due to the likely saturation of the individual exposures. The
total number of ﬁles downloaded varies per star to reach a max-
imum S/N of about 2000 for the ﬁnal combined spectrum, and
a minimum of 20 for a ﬁnal single-exposure spectrum. We note
that the cited S/N values are from photon counts and that the
real S/N should depend on other noise sources (e.g., background
subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding), although they should not diﬀer much
for the ﬁnal combined spectrum. We obtain the ﬁnal combined
spectrum for each star for a given instrument and conﬁguration
by shifting all spectra to the same wavelength reference before
the ﬂux combination, using a cross-correlation function with the
highest S/N individual spectrum taken as the mask.

We keep track of the search parameters used for the data in
the archive (e.g., S/N cuts) and the list of the individual spectra
used for the ﬁnal combined spectrum. Moreover, we keep ﬁgures

query.eso at the time of the compilation of the data.

the archives. We plan to provide such spectra in a future update
of SWEET-Cat.

Since this is a signiﬁcant amount of data the selection of
spectra and their combination is an automatic process. However,
there is a human validation to certify the quality of the end prod-
ucts. The main problems identiﬁed during the validation include
the following:

i) incorrect identiﬁcation of the star: some stars are very close
in the sky. For example, stars in the Kepler ﬁeld and close in
binaries can be easily mismatched when searching the archival
data. We identify mismatches by cross-checking the lists of spec-
tra used for each star. if we ﬁnd a ﬁle used for two or more stars,
we discard that spectrum and redo the combination process with
the updated list.

ii) data reduction process: some individual spectra in the ﬁg-
ures show unexpected ﬂux variations and/or strange behavior in
the continuum (e.g., ripples or strong spikes). These likely in-
dicate a problem with the reduction of the archival spectra. We
discard these spectra and redo the combination process.

iii) radial velocity correction: some spectra were not prop-
erly shifted in radial velocity before the spectral combination by
looking at the ﬁgures. We identify the ﬁles and apply the cross-
correlation function with diﬀerent parameters to correct the is-
sue. If that fails, we discard the ﬁles and redo the combination
process.

We searched for spectra in other archives for the host stars
of SWEET-Cat. In particular, archives where we could do
the search and download automatically. We used custom-made
python scripts to search for and download spectra from the SO-
PHIE8, ESPADONS9, and HARPS-N10 spectrographs archival
data. We combined these data in the same way as for the ESO
spectral data.

We show the S/N distribution of the combined spectra and
the dependence between the GAIA magnitude and the S/N in Fig
1. The peak at S/N ∼ 2000 arises because we stop the stacking
of spectra once we reach this value.

2.3. Legacy spectral data

We keep the combined spectra from previous versions of
SWEET-Cat for some host stars (75 spectra). They either are
of better quality than the ones we combined automatically or are
from a public archive of instruments not searched in this version
(e.g., FIES). Also, we constrained the compilation of new data to
host stars with temperatures above 4200K since we do not plan
to use our methodology on cooler stars.

2.4. Spectra format

The spectra compilation followed the basic procedure described
in Sousa et al. (2018). We store the combined spectra in ﬁts ﬁles.
In the ﬁts header, in addition to the essential keywords, we added
the search parameters, the GAIA DR2 id11, the search box area,
the date related to the data search, and the respective combi-
nations. Moreover, we include the list with the reduced frames
used for the combined spectra and their S/N information from

11 At the time of the combination of spectra the GAIA DR2 was an
identiﬁer in Simbad (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/), while the GAIA eDR3
was not.

3. Stellar parameters

3.1. Spectroscopic parameters
We carried out the spectroscopic analysis with ARES+MOOG
for the new spectroscopic data and the legacy data (for details
see Sousa 2014). We re-derived the homogeneous parameters
already in SWEET-Cat for several host stars, given that we ei-
ther collected higher quality data or decided to apply the latest
version of the codes described previously. The spectral analy-
sis relies on the excitation and ionization balance of iron abun-
dance. The ARES code12 (Sousa et al. 2007, 2015a) automati-
cally measures the equivalent widths of the absorption lines. The
MOOG code (Sneden 1973) is used for the element abundances
assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and using a
grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 plane-parallel model atmospheres (Ku-
rucz 1993). We applied this method in our previous spectro-
scopic studies of planet hosts (e.g., Sousa et al. 2008, 2011a;
Mortier et al. 2013; Sousa et al. 2015b; Andreasen et al. 2017;
Sousa et al. 2018). We used the same line list introduced in Sousa
et al. (2008), except for the stars with eﬀective temperature be-
low 5200K where we used the line list provided in Tsantaki et al.
(2013).

The atomic data, in particular the oscillator strengths (log gf
values), were re-calibrated to match the solar abundances as in
our previous works, but in this case, we used the 2019 version of
MOOG. The log gf values slightly diﬀer, most likely due to nu-
merical diﬀerences between the code compilations or versions.
We collected combined spectra from two or more instru-
ments or conﬁgurations for several host stars, and hence they
have more than one set of converged parameters. The results
from spectra from diﬀerent instruments are generally consistent
within the errors (see Fig. 3 in Sousa et al. 2008 for typical dis-
persion of parameters for the same stars with our methodology
using spectra from diﬀerent instruments). We include only one
set of converged parameters per star in SWEET-Cat. The selec-
tion of such a set of parameters relies on the results of the spec-
troscopic analysis. The errors associated with the parameters are
decisive since they are related to the quality of the spectra (S/N
and resolution). If the errors are similar, we select the set of pa-
rameters from the higher resolution spectra. In Figure 2 we show
the comparison between the parameters derived in this work and
the values previously listed in SWEET-Cat or literature values.

In previous versions of SWEET-Cat 645 host stars had ho-
mogeneous parameters. The new and old parameters are consis-
tent, regarding eﬀective temperature and [Fe/H]; the mean dif-
ferences are only -5±64 K and 0.01±0.06 dex, respectively. We
derived homogeneous parameters for 278 new stars in SWEET-
Cat. Consistency between our values and the literature values
(mainly gathered from the discovery paper) is not as good; for ef-
fective temperature and [Fe/H] the mean diﬀerences are 62±181
K and 0.05±0.14 dex, respectively. There are signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences between the parameters for some host stars, even when
they were already in SWEET-Cat. The use of higher quality
spectra for the new parameters can explain the majority of these
discrepancies. We exemplify other reasons with the following
two stars. For HAT-P-23, we had parameters from a lower S/N
spectrum using a synthesis method, but since we recovered a

higher quality spectrum and the star has a reasonable low vsini,
we now used the standard ARES+MOOG methodology. For
HIP75458, there was an undetected typo for the listed eﬀective
temperature in SWEET-Cat. Finally, these comparisons identi-
ﬁed mismatches in the spectrum source. For example, we got a
completely diﬀerent set of parameters for HD98219 using the
new UVES spectra compiled from the ESO archive. We then re-
alized that the downloaded spectra belonged to TYC 6649-793-
1, and therefore we kept the values from the FEROS legacy spec-
trum used in previous works for HD98219.

3.2. Use of GAIA eDR3

We matched the stars listed in SWEET-Cat with the GAIA ID
in DR2 and eDR3 using their coordinates and the VizieR cat-
alogs (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2021). We checked the
magnitudes and astrometry data to conﬁrm that we selected the
correct star. While most stars in SWEET-Cat have the same ID
as for GAIA DR2, there are GAIA IDs that appear to change
between the data releases. The correct GAIA ID identiﬁcation
was not straightforward in some cases because of the presence
of other stars with similar magnitudes in the searched ﬁeld of
view. The GAIA IDs make it easier for SWEET-Cat users to
combine the spectroscopic data with the GAIA astrometry. For
each target with a GAIA ID, we proceed to the extraction of its
parallax from eDR3. Parallax was one of the columns present in
the SWEET-Cat table, but not necessarily updated for the whole
sample. GAIA parallaxes should be taken with caution for very
bright stars as they may have additional systematic errors due
to calibration issues (Drimmel et al. 2019). We included in the
SWEET-Cat table the parallax listed in Simbad, if available, with
the respective ﬂag for the very bright host stars with no GAIA
data. We have also included in SWEET-Cat the relevant columns
for stellar characterization from GAIA photometry, such as the
G magnitude (Gmag), the red and the blue passband magnitudes

(RPmag and BPmag), and the mean ﬂux for the G band (FG).
We included a photometric activity index based on the GAIA

which is the relative error on the G mean ﬂux, where oGmag is
the number of observations (CCD transits) that contributed to the
G mean ﬂux and mean ﬂux error (eFG).

3.3. Precise surface gravity from GAIA parallax

We recall that the spectroscopic stellar surface gravities derived
by our method are the least constrained parameters in our anal-
ysis (e.g., Tsantaki et al. 2019). The reason behind this was ad-
dressed in our past works and is related to the small number of
ionized iron lines available in the optical spectrum that we can
measure. We introduced some corrections to improve the surface
gravity estimations (e.g., Mortier et al. 2014). An alternative is
to estimate the trigonometric surface gravity, as we did in the
past (e.g., Santos et al. 2004; Sousa et al. 2008; Tsantaki et al.
2013; Delgado Mena et al. 2017), using the following expres-
sion derived from the luminosity-radius-temperature relation for
stars:

laxes (orange circles) are in better agreement with the model tracks than
the spectroscopic values (gray crosses) for the dwarf stars.

where MG is the absolute GAIA magnitude, Te f f is the eﬀective

the IAU resolution 2015 B2), and BCG(Te f f ) is a temperature-
dependent bolometric correction provided in the GAIA docu-
mentation (equation 8.9 and Table 8.3, Andrae et al. 2018). In-
stead of a simple inversion of the GAIA parallax to provide a
distance, we preferred to include the geometric distance and an
error directly taken from the maximum of the asymmetric uncer-
tainty measures (16th and 84th percentiles) reported in Bailer-
Jones et al. (2021).

3.4. Precise surface gravity from GAIA parallax

To estimate the trigonometric surface gravity, we need the stellar
mass. As in previous works, we used the stellar mass calibration
in Torres et al. (2010), and for estimates between 0.7 and 1.3M(cid:12)
we used the correction in Santos et al. (2013). However, this Tor-
res et al. (2010) calibration requires spectroscopic parameters of
the star as input, including the surface gravity. Therefore, we per-
formed an iterative process to converge simultaneously for the
best estimates of the stellar mass and the trigonometric surface
gravity. The procedure consists of the following steps:

1. The spectroscopic surface gravity is used as an initial value;
2. The surface gravity, together with the Te f f and the [Fe/H],
is then used to compute the stellar mass from the Torres et al.
(2010) calibration;

3. The stellar mass is used to re-derive a new trigonometric sur-

face gravity;

4. If the new surface gravity is within 0.01 dex of the previous
value, we stop this process. Otherwise, we go back to step 1
with the new surface gravity value for the next iteration.

13 https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR2/, in particular
chapter 8.3.3 authored by Orlagh Creevey and Christophe Ordenovic.

We applied the same methodology for the trigonometric sur-
face gravity and the ﬁnal stellar mass errors as in previous works
(see Santos et al. 2013; Sousa et al. 2018). We used a Monte
Carlo approach taking 10 000 random values from the Gaussian
distributions of the input parameters considering their uncertain-
ties. We estimated the errors from the standard deviation of the
stellar mass and the trigonometric surface gravity distributions in
the ﬁnal iteration. A potential ﬂaw in this iterative procedure can
be the lack of interaction with the other spectroscopic param-
eters (eﬀective temperature and [Fe/H]) since they are also in-
puts for the mass estimation. However, from our experience with
ARES+MOOG, we know that there is low interdependence of
these parameters and in particular with the surface gravity (this
is consistent with other equivalent-width methods using MOOG
as discussed in Torres et al. 2012 and Mortier et al. 2014). Us-
ing a subsample of the planet-hosts in SWEET-Cat, we show
in Figure A.1 the small diﬀerences that we ﬁnd for the eﬀec-
tive temperature and metallicity when constraining the surface
gravity with the trigonometric value for the spectroscopic anal-
ysis. Hence, the spectroscopic eﬀective temperature and metal-
licity are well constrained and do not change signiﬁcantly with
the potential change of the surface gravity. Figure 3 shows the
SWEET-Cat stars in the log g – Teﬀ diagram, along with solar
metallicity CESAM stellar model tracks for main-sequence to
post-main-sequence stars with masses ranging from 0.8 to 2.4
M(cid:12) (Marques et al. 2008). The trigonometric surface gravities
agree better with the theoretical tracks than with the spectroscop-
ically derived values, especially for cool dwarf stars.

3.5. Correction for the spectroscopic surface gravity

We can correct our spectroscopic surface gravity if we take the
trigonometric surface gravity as the true value of the stellar sur-
face gravity. The diﬀerence between the trigonometric and spec-
troscopic surface gravity values depends on the eﬀective tem-
perature of the stars for dwarf stars. We show this diﬀerence as
a function of eﬀective temperature for dwarf stars (logg > 4.0)
in Figure 4. Considering the trend seen in Figure 4, we use a
weighted linear ﬁt to get a corrected spectroscopic surface grav-

This linear relation, although not applicable to all the catalog
stars, is not that far from those reported in Tsantaki et al. (2013),
Mortier et al. (2014), and Delgado Mena et al. (2017).

Although we trust that the derived spectroscopic surface
gravity does not aﬀect the rest of the spectroscopic parameters by
ARES+MOOG, the corrected loggs values can aid in the identi-
ﬁcation of the evolutionary status of the star by providing con-
straints for its age. Accurate surface gravities may be also rele-
vant for the chemical abundances that rely on few spectral lines
with a strong dependence on log g.

4.1. SWEET-Cat planet-host statistics

Table 1 presents the updated numbers of host stars in SWEET-
Cat. The main reason for a relatively small number of stars with
spectra (and therefore homogeneous parameters14) is that a con-
siderable number of the planet-hosts come from the detections
provided by the Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010). These are
faint stars and are usually not followed up by RV surveys since
it is observationally costly to collect high-quality high-resolution
spectra for them. For bright stars the spectroscopic stellar param-
eters are fundamental to get precise bulk stellar parameters. The
stellar mass and radius are crucial to obtain reliable planetary-
mass measurements from RV surveys and reliable planetary ra-
dius measurements from precise transit observations (e.g., Hoyer
et al. 2021; Leleu et al. 2021). The percentage of stars with spec-
tra and homogeneous parameters increases for bright stars listed
in SWEET-Cat. With the work presented in this paper, consider-
ing the addition of 283 new stars with homogeneous parameters,
we have ∼88% and ∼76% completeness for stars with G<9 and
G<12, respectively. Completeness represents the number of host
stars with homogeneous spectroscopic parameters relative to the
total number of stars listed in SWEET-Cat. We signiﬁcantly in-
crease the number of homogeneous parameters for planet host
stars with this update. However, the continuous increase of new
host stars in the catalog keeps the percentage for bright stars
almost the same. In Table 1 we can also see that there is still
a subset of bright planet-host stars (233 stars, about ∼25% of
the bright FGK stars) for which we did not ﬁnd, at the time of
the compilation of this data, high-quality public data at the time
of the search for this work. These will be the focus of the next
SWEET-Cat update.

troscopic parameters in SWEET-Cat. This ﬂag was called “source” in
the old table.

We add new parameters in the updated version of SWEET-Cat15,
and their descriptions are in Table B.1. In the web page version
of the catalog only a fraction of these columns are present for
visualization reasons, but all columns are in the table available
for download at the website. On the new website the commu-
nity can ﬁnd additional content: a Python notebook example on
how to use the new SWEET-Cat table and a gallery with updated
ﬁgures of the population of the planet-host stars and the correla-
tions found between the planets and hosts stars.

4.3. Link to exoplanet catalogs

The match of SWEET-Cat host star parameters with the proper-
ties of their exoplanets in online databases is quite useful for the
statistical exploration of the data. However, given that we only
control the SWEET-Cat table, the continuous match with exter-
nal databases is not always straightforward. At ﬁrst SWEET-Cat
kept entries for the conﬁrmed planet-hosts in exoplanet.eu ex-
clusively, and we did the matching with the names of the plan-
ets that inherit it from the host star. This approach turned out
to be problematic: some planets names either changed regularly
(Keppler objects of interest to Kepler denominations is a typi-
cal example) or were not consistent within the planetary system
(e.g., K2-50 with K2-50b and EPIC201833600 c listed in exo-
planet.eu). Therefore, we now rely on the host coordinates ob-
tained from the Simbad database, and we compare them against
the coordinates listed in exoplanets.eu and the NASA exoplanet
archive. The updated SWEET-Cat table has the planet coordi-
nates listed in both the exoplanet.eu and the NASA archive exo-
planets database to facilitate any matching. By adding the planet
coordinates in both databases, we can match the objects even if
the coordinates are incorrect (e.g., due to typos) in the planet
databases. We provide a python script example on the website to
show the capabilities to explore SWEET-Cat and the properties
of the exoplanets statistically.

5. Exoplanets and their host stars: Review of

star–planet relations

5.1. Revisiting the planet frequency–stellar metallicity

correlation

The strong correlation between the presence of planets and the
stellar metallicity observed for the host stars is the ﬁrst observa-
tional constraint for planet formation theories. It became evident
soon after the ﬁrst discoveries of exoplanets (e.g., Gonzalez &
Laws 2000; Santos et al. 2001, 2004; Fischer & Valenti 2005).
However, these ﬁrst detections suﬀered a strong observational
bias: the most massive and hotter planets are easier to be discov-
ered. The improvement in the precision of the detection methods
allowed the discovery of lighter and cooler planets, increasing
the planetary system sample to study the planet-metallicity cor-
relation. In particular, the planet–metallicity correlation seemed
not to be present even for the very ﬁrst detected low-mass exo-
planets, or to be at least diﬀerent from the positive correlation
observed for giant planets (e.g., Udry et al. 2006; Sousa et al.
2008; Ghezzi et al. 2010; Sousa et al. 2011a; Buchhave et al.
2012). Wang & Fischer (2015) suggested the possibility of a uni-
versal planet–metallicity correlation for all planets, but it could
be related to a higher planet frequency and a lower detectabil-
ity of low-mass planets (see also Zhu et al. 2016). Today the

planet–metallicity correlations seem to be well established in
the exoplanet community, but the detection of additional low-
mass planets with precise masses can aid in the understanding of
these correlations in diﬀerent regimes. SWEET-Cat is a perfect
test bench for these studies due to its homogeneous nature (e.g.,
Adibekyan 2019) using the previous version of SWEET-Cat.

We present the metallicity distributions for two diﬀerent pop-
ulations classiﬁed according to their masses: low-mass planets
(LMP, <30 M⊕: 231 planets) and low-mass planet hosts (LMPH:
99 planet hosts), and high-mass planets (HMP, >30 M⊕: 889
planets) and high-mass planet hosts (HMPH: 771 planet hosts)
with homogeneous parameters from SWEET-Cat in Figure 5. We
kept 30 M⊕ as the split reference value of the samples of exo-
planets to match the location of the gap in the planet mass distri-
bution in Mayor et al. (2011) and to be consistent with our pre-
vious works (e.g., Sousa et al. 2011b, 2018). Figure 5 is an up-
dated version of Figure 4 in Sousa et al. (2018). In the top panel
we plot the metallicity distribution for all planets, and therefore
the stellar metallicity is repeated more than once for the multi-
planetary systems. In the bottom panel we plot the metallicity
distribution for the most massive planet in each system only.
For comparison, we include the metallicity distribution of solar
neighborhood stars from both the HARPS and CORALIE vol-
ume limited-based samples (discussed in Sousa et al. 2011a) (see
also Udry et al. 2000; Santos et al. 2004; Sousa et al. 2008). The
positive metallicity correlation for massive planets continues to
hold, even with the inclusion of new planetary systems in the dis-
tribution. We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test to quan-

tify the similarities of the three populations studied here. Table 2
contains the statistics for the comparisons. The K-S test results
conﬁrm that it is unlikely that the LMPH and HMPH popula-
tions belong to the same stellar sample and cannot rule out that
the LMPH and solar neighborhood populations may belong to
the same population. However, in the bottom right panel of Fig-
ure 5 there is a slight shift of the LMPH CDF toward metal-rich
values compared with the CDF of the neighborhood stars. We
did not observe this shift in Sousa et al. (2018, Figure 4), where
the CDFs were indistinguishable from each other. This behav-
ior may be linked to the slight planet–metallicity correlation for
low-mass stars discussed in Sousa et al. (2019) and later in this
paper in section 5.3.

5.2. Hot vs. cold Jupiters

The increased precision of the detection methods allows the dis-
covery of lower mass planets, but the course of time works in
our favor to constrain the frequency of Jupiter-like planets found
at long periods. We focus now on the massive planets, with
masses above one-quarter of a Jupiter mass (>0.25 MJ, equiv-
alent to ∼80 M⊕), and split them between hot and cold HMPs
using a period cut at 40 days. We also discarded planets with
masses above 4 MJ, as in Santos et al. (2017), to avoid over-
lap with possible brown dwarfs (most values are the minimum
mass msini). The 40-day split value of the sample of HMPs fol-
lows from the double-peaked period distribution in Figure 7. We

of massive planets in Figure 6. Although both groups are metal-
rich compared with that of ﬁeld dwarfs, contributing both similar
to the metal-rich nature of stars hosting HMPs, there are some

diﬀerences in the proﬁle of their distribution. The K-S test to
quantify the similarities is presented in Table 2 and indicates a
low probability that both populations belong to the same sam-
ple of stars. In particular, cold HMPs are more frequent around
metal-poor stars than hot HMPs. Known hot-HMP hosts exhibit
metallicities higher than -0.4 dex, while the metallicity distribu-
tion of cold-HMP hosts reaches lower values ([Fe/H]∼-0.7 dex).
These results agree with the period-metallicity correlation (see
Adibekyan et al. 2013; Beaugé & Nesvorný 2013; Mulders et al.
2016; Wilson et al. 2018; van der Marel & Mulders 2021). The
mean metallicity diﬀerence between hot and cold HMPs is 0.09

served in Mulders et al. (2016) and Wilson et al. (2018). The
value discrepancy may be related to the use of diﬀerent samples
of stars, and/or the split selection of the HMP. In Mulders et al.
(2016) and Wilson et al. (2018) the planet sample contains both
the most and the less massive planets, while we isolate them in
a speciﬁc range of masses (0.25 - 4 MJ). These works propose
possible explanations to explain this metallicity enrichment for
short-period planet hosts: dust sublimation, which can correlate
with metallicity (e.g., Muzerolle et al. 2003); the planet migra-
tion mechanism and its dependence on metallicity, where planets
around higher metallicity stars are “trapped” closer to the host
stars while migrating inward (e.g., Plavchan & Bilinski 2013);
rocky planet ingestion in the host star, forced by the migration of
the short-period giant planets (e.g., Mack et al. 2014); and mi-
gration by planet-planet interactions (Dawson & Murray-Clay
2013). Wilson et al. (2018) address all of these and other pos-
sibilities, but it is still unclear which is responsible for this ob-
servational result. We also cannot rule out that several of these
mechanisms can work simultaneously at some stages of the evo-
lution of the systems. In the bottom panel of Figure 6, we show
the distribution of planetary mass for both cool and hot HMPs.
Hot Jupiters are a distinct population from the cool Jupiters, ex-
hibiting a right-skewed mass distribution with a median close
to the Jupiter mass. The cold HMPs show a ﬂat distribution be-
tween 0.25 - 2 MJ, skewing toward the right for masses higher
than 2 MJ. However, we must keep in mind that it is more diﬃ-
cult to detect planets at long periods, and therefore we might be
missing the detection of planets with masses lower than or simi-

lar to that of Jupiter at long periods. As suggested by Santos et al.
(2017), diﬀerent formation mechanisms acting for these popula-
tions can explain the discrepancies in mass distribution. For ex-
ample, many of these more massive bodies may have formed as
low-mass stars do (e.g., Luhman 2012). Adibekyan (2019) sug-
gests that planets of the same mass can form through diﬀerent
channels depending on the mass of the star–disk (i.e., environ-
mental conditions can aﬀect planet formation). Another possible
explanation for the mass distribution diﬀerence may be related to
an in situ formation hypothesis that may preferentially produce
lower mass hot Jupiters. In this scenario, a massive planet close
to the star will have fewer local solids and less gas to accrete,
setting by default an upper mass limit related to the local disk
structure (e.g., Batygin et al. 2016). Migration can also explain
this discrepancy if we consider that a more massive body can
open deep gaps in the disk, decreasing the migration eﬃciency
(Masset & Papaloizou 2003). In addition, the evaporation of gas
giants close to the star may remove enough material to decrease
their initial mass value. For a review of hot Jupiters, see Dawson
& Johnson (2018) and references therein.

5.3. Stellar mass and planetary mass

The relation between the occurrence rate of planets and stellar
mass is a statistical result from exoplanetary surveys that en-
riches our understanding of planet formation (e.g., Fulton & Pe-
tigura 2018; Lozovsky et al. 2021; Neil & Rogers 2018; Yang

Article number, page 9 of 14

A&A proofs: manuscript no. SWEETCat_v2_lang

et al. 2020). Because SWEET-Cat is a catalog of host stars only,
it is impossible to estimate the occurrence rates of planets and
their dependence on stellar parameters. However, SWEET-Cat
data can be used to check if the mass distributions of stars host-
ing diﬀerent planet types agree with the results related to occur-
rence rates. We focus these analyses on the hosts with trigono-
metric surface gravities above 4.00 dex (dwarf stars) since we
rely on the Torres et al. (2010) calibration. As we do in Sec-
tion 5.1., we split the sample into low-mass planet hosts LMPHs
and high-mass planet hosts HMPHs, and we show their distri-
butions in the top panels of Figure 8. The LMPHs present, on
average, lower masses than the HMPHs. The LMPH and HMPH
distributions have averages of 0.89 ± 0.16 M(cid:12) and 1.06 ± 0.21
M(cid:12), respectively. The K-S test indicates a very low probability
(1.95e-12) that the samples are drawn from the same distribu-
tion. The mass distributions of LMPHs and HMPHs in SWEET-
Cat agree with surveys results that indicate that the occurrence
rate of sub-Neptunes increases as stellar mass decreases (e.g.,
Mulders et al. 2015, with spectral type as a proxy for stellar
mass). However, low-mass or small planets are harder to detect
around massive dwarf stars, especially at large distances, and we
may be missing them. This observational bias could therefore
play a role in the shape of the sub-Neptune distribution. If we
now focus only on the HMPHs and classify them by the type of
planet they have (cold or hot), we see a marginal diﬀerence in
their respective stellar mass distributions (bottom panels of Fig-
ure 8). The stars with cold and hot HMPs have a mean mass of
1.02 ± 0.16 M(cid:12) and 1.12 ± 0.22 M(cid:12), respectively. The K-S test
assigns a low probability (6.02e-7) that these samples are drawn
from the same distribution. Interestingly, the mass distribution
of the hosts of hot HMPs is slightly double-peaked, and up to ∼
0.9 M(cid:12), both distributions are similar. Once again, observation
biases may play a role in what we see since massive long-period
planets are easier to detect around low-mass host stars.

5.4. Metallicity-period-mass diagram for low-mass planets

In Sousa et al. (2019), we suggested a hint for a correlation
in the metallicity-period-mass diagram for low-mass exoplanets
(<30 M⊕), where low-mass exoplanets have increased masses
for longer periods at higher metallicities. However, the observa-
tional bias from RV surveys where the massive planets are easier
to discover at long periods could explain the correlation. The
sample studied in Sousa et al. (2019) contained 84 exoplanets
with homogeneous metallicities and mass determination with a
relative precision within 20%, and we concluded that the ob-
served correlation was tighter than the expected one from the
observational detection bias.

Figure 9 shows the metallicity-period-mass diagram for the
updated SWEET-Cat sample (equivalent to Figure 2 in Sousa
et al. 2019). With the new homogeneous parameters introduced
in this work, we increase the low-mass planet sample with pre-
cise masses (within 20%) to 131 planets (an increase of 56%).
We did a new 3D plane ﬁt with the new low-mass planet sample,
including the errors of all variables (see Appendix A of Sousa
et al. 2019). We found the following metallicity-period-mass re-
lation:

Mp = (4.9 ± 0.2) + (13.4 ± 0.4) ∗ [Fe/H] + (5.3 ± 0.2) ∗ log(P). (5)

This relation, although close to the one presented before,
shows a slightly stronger dependence on both metallicity and
the period. To assess the observational bias in this relation we

compare these dependencies with the values extracted from the
Monte Carlo simulations done in Section 3.2 in Sousa et al.
(2019); the expected observational bias correlation would pro-
duce a metallicity slope (m1) of 1.20 ± 8.43 [M⊕/dex] and a
period slope (m2) of 3.21 ± 1.38 [M⊕/dex]. From these respec-
tive distributions the metallicity-mass correlation (m1) due to the
observational bias is weak, but with high uncertainty.

Our metallicity-mass correlation (13.4 [M⊕/dex]) is outside
the 1σ standard deviation, making it unlikely to retrieve this
value by chance under our assumptions. For the period corre-
lation (m2) the expected correlation due to observational bias is
high, but more precise when compared with m1. The value for
m2, 5.3 [M⊕/dex] obtained with the updated observational data
is still close, but also now it appears to be outside 1σ in compar-
ison with the previous results.

Compared with previous results, the increased number of
low-mass exoplanets strengthens the linear correlations of planet
mass with metallicity and period. However, we still cannot ex-
clude the possibility that the observation bias can explain the
correlations found.

6. Summary

We presented a signiﬁcant update of SWEET-Cat where 283
planet host stars have new precise and homogeneous spectro-
scopic parameters using spectra that we collected from diﬀer-
ent sources. We reviewed nearly all spectroscopic parameters
using new combined spectra and recent versions of the codes
used in our spectroscopic analysis. We also updated SWEET-
Cat with relevant columns for the stellar characterization, most
of them related to GAIA eDR3. We used the GAIA parallaxes
and photometry to estimate accurate trigonometric surface grav-
ities to include them in SWEET-Cat. We also reviewed planet–
host metallicity correlations with a speciﬁc focus on the diﬀer-
ences between stars hosting low-mass planets and stars hosting
massive ones. The well-established correlation for stars hosting
giant planets continues to hold, while with the increased number
of low-mass planet detections, we were able to better character-
ize the planet–metallicity correlation for the low-mass regime.
We found that stars hosting low-mass planets have a similar dis-
tribution to the stars in the solar neighborhood, but that slightly

S. G. Sousa et al.: SWEET-Cat 2.0: The Cat just got SWEETer

higher metallicities were favored. We showed the metallicity dis-
tributions for massive planets, splitting them between hot and
cool according to their period. We found diﬀerences between
these distributions that are consistent with results in the litera-
ture. Finally, we reviewed the metallicity-period-mass correla-
tion for the low-mass planets. The correlation became slightly
tighter with the inclusion of new planets, although it is still un-
clear if the reason behind it is the RV observational bias.

We will continue working on SWEET-Cat in the following
years to provide the community with a data set relevant for sta-
tistical studies of exoplanets. There is still a signiﬁcant number
of relatively bright planet-hosts listed without homogeneous pa-
rameters. We will provide spectroscopic parameters once high-
quality spectra are available. Furthermore, we have plans to in-
clude homogeneous element abundances for the stars with the
highest quality spectra, make the spectra available for download
on the website, and include more robust determinations of stellar
masses, radii, and ages from stellar modeling.

Appendix A: Spectroscopic parameters using the

trigonometric surface gravity

Figure A.1 shows the eﬀective temperatures and metallicities
derived by the standard analysis against the same parameters
using trigonometric surface gravities. We used a subsample of
150 planet-host stars randomly selected from the whole homo-
geneous sample in SWEET-Cat. From these stars, 117 hosts
converged results in a single run of the spectroscopic analy-
sis ARES+MOOG when constraining the surface gravity. These
constrained parameters are the ones used in Figure A.1. As ex-
pected, the eﬀective temperatures and metallicities show small
changes using the constrained surface gravity. The mean diﬀer-
ences between the eﬀective temperatures and the metallicity val-
ues are -20 ± 76 K and 0 ± 0.06 dex, respectively. These values
were derived even with the presence of a few outliers noticeable
in the ﬁgure. These are stars with a low S/N spectrum or stars
cold enough to make diﬃcult the derivation of reliable param-
eters (e.g., Tsantaki et al. 2013). In the bottom panel of Figure
A.1 is shown the dependence of the diﬀerences on the changes
in the surface gravity. There are evident trends in these plots,
but they show little dependence on the diﬀerences in the sur-
face gravity derived in the ARES+MOOG. The above is com-
patible with Figures 4 and 5 of Mortier et al. (2014), even when
that sample includes evolved stars. Therefore, the unconstrained
spectroscopic analysis ARES+MOOG derives reliable and con-
sistent eﬀective temperatures and metallicities, even in the cases
where we have less accurate spectroscopic surface gravities.
