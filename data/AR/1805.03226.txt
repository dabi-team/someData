ABSTRACT: To elucidate the role of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an additive in the standard carbonate-based electrolyte for Li-ion 
batteries, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed during electrochemical cycling on silicon anodes was analyzed with a combination of 
solution  and  solid-state  NMR  techniques,  including  dynamic  nuclear  polarization.  To  facilitate  characterization  via  1D  and  2D  NMR,  we 
synthesized 13C-enriched FEC, ultimately allowing a detailed structural assignment of the organic SEI. We find that the soluble PEO-like line-
ar oligomeric electrolyte breakdown products that are observed after cycling in the standard ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolyte are 
suppressed in the presence of 10 vol % FEC additive.  FEC is first defluorinated to form soluble vinylene carbonate and vinoxyl species, which 
react to form both soluble and insoluble branched ethylene-oxide based polymers.  No evidence for branched polymers are observed in the 
absence of FEC. 

INTRODUCTION 

The formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the elec-
trode  surface  is  critical  for  the  cycle  life  of  lithium  ion  batteries 
(LIBs). Stable SEI formation on the anode is particularly important, 
because current LIBs operate outside the stable voltage window of 
the organic carbonate based liquid electrolyte (<1.3 - 0.8 V vs. Li).1 
Without such a SEI, continuous breakdown of the electrolyte pro-
ceeds  uninhibited  upon  further  cycling,  which  irreversibly  con-
sumes the Li source and leads to capacity fading.2,3 Although elec-
trolytes have been optimized so that they form a stable SEI on the 
commercial  graphite  anode,  preventing  significant  capacity  fade 
even  after  extended  cycling,  problems  remain  for  next  generation, 
higher-capacity anodes such as Si, Sn and Li metal.4 Optimizing the 
SEI  that  forms  on  Si  is  particularly  important  because  Si  anodes 
offer a theoretical capacity (3579 mAh/g) that is nearly an order of 
magnitude  greater  than  that  of  graphite  (372 mAh/g).4  Unfortu-
nately,  the  lithiation  and  delithiation  of  Si  electrodes  is  accompa-
nied  by  a  large  volume  expansion  (~300%,  for  the  formation  of 
Li3.75Si)5,  which  leads  to  continuous  exposure  of  fresh  Si  surface 
during  cycling,  and  results  in  uncontrolled  SEI  growth  and  poor 
cycling performance.6   The mechanisms and reactions involved in 
SEI formation on Si differ from those on the graphite, because the 
soluble and insoluble decomposition products can con

Scheme  1.  Structures  of  ethylene  carbonate  (EC),  fluoroeth-

tinue to react largely unimpeded at lower voltages (due to exposed 
fresh lithium silicide surfaces) and over multiple cycles.  In an effort 
to  stabilize  the  SEI  on  Si,  sacrificial  electrolyte  additives  are  com-
monly used to improve the cycle life.8 Among the numerous possi-
ble  electrolyte  additives,  fluoroethylene  carbonate  (FEC)  is  the 
most widely used one and has been shown to improve the capacity 
retention  of  Si9,  Li  anodes10  and  a  series  of  cathode  materials.11,12 
However,  the  mechanisms  by  which  these  additives  modify  the 
nature of the SEI are not well understood due to the inherent diffi-
culties  associated  with  characterizing  disordered  interfacial  struc-
tures.  Characterization  of  the  few  nanometer-thick  SEI  layer  is 
further  convoluted  by  the  fact  that  the  material  is  usually  air-
sensitive and amorphous, the former presenting challenges in sam-
ple  preparation  and  the  latter  with  structural  assignment  with,  for 

 
 
 
example,  diffraction-based  techniques.  Despite  these  difficulties, 
electrolyte breakdown products in the presence of FEC have been 
characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and modeling approach-
es to provide insight into the chemical composition of the SEI on 
Si. For instance, Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy 
suggested  that  FEC  likely  transforms  to  vinylene  carbonate  (VC) 
through  HF  elimination  and  subsequently  polymerizes  to  form 
poly(VC)-type species.13 In contrast, Nakai et al. studied the reduc-
tion  of  EC-free,  FEC-based  electrolyte  on  Si  by  X-ray  photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS) and flight–secondary ion mass spectrom-
etry (ToF-SIMS)   and found evidence for oxygen-deficient species 
such  as  polyene.11  The  presence  of  low-oxygen  content  polyenes 
was  further  supported  by  energy-dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy 
(EDS)12 and on-line electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS)13 
performed during the reduction of FEC on Si. An FEC decomposi-
tion  intermediate,  the  vinoxyl  radical  (HC(=O)CH2),  was  pro-
posed by Balbuena and co-workers17 through ab initio calculations, 
and  was  later  experimentally  detected  by  Shkrob  et  al.  using  elec-
tron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.18 The vinoxyl radical is 
formed  via  a  one-electron  reduction  of  FEC,  resulting  in  the  for-
17,18. The vinoxyl radi-
mation of LiF and the concurrent loss of CO2
cal can then react further with EC or FEC to form oligomers of the 
form HC(=O)CH2OR17,18 and is believed to initiate the polymeri-
zation that eventually results in a highly cross-linked network.18  

During  cycling,  the  Si  surface  can  be  modified  by  reacting  with 
electrolyte.  XPS  study  by  Philippe  et  al.  suggested  that  Si  can  be 
oxidized  during  cycling,  forming  lithium  silicate  and  fluorosilicate 
in the presence of LiPF6.16 Nakai et al. suggested that FEC can pro-
tect the Si surface against electrolyte oxidation, probably due to the 
formation  of  a  passivation  layer  on  Si  surface.14  A  recent  detailed 
XPS study by Schroder et al. concluded that the reduction of FEC 
leads to the formation of a kinetically stable SEI comprising a more 
dense layer of lithium fluoride and lithium oxide near the Si surface, 
which improve lithiation kinetics.20 

Michan et al. used solid-state NMR (ssNMR) to analyze the pre-
cipitate formed by chemically reducing FEC with lithium naphtha-
lenide and proposed a structure for the resulting polymeric species 
(Scheme 1, poly(VC)).7 A 13C NMR resonance at 100 ppm, which 
had not been previously observed in the decomposition products of 
EC,  was  assigned  to  an  acetal  carbon  (a  protonated  carbon  envi-
ronment adjacent to two oxygen groups), and represents a poten-
tial  cross-linking  unit  in  poly(VC).  Of  note,  acetal  carbons  were 
observed in pioneering NMR studies of the SEI formed on graphite 
by  Leifer  et  al.21  However,  some  of  the  resonances  in  Michan(cid:1)s 
study  were  partially  obscured  by  the  presence  of  excess  lithium 
naphthalenide  in  the  precipitate  which  complicated  further  analy-
sis.  Perhaps  more  importantly,  the  chemically  induced  FEC-
polymer  may  differ  from  the  organic  SEI  generated  through  elec-
trochemical reduction, necessitating further studies on SEI decom-
position  products  formed  in  battery  materials  over  the  course  of 
cycling.  

Here, we use a combination of solution and solid-state NMR to 
characterize and  rationalize the formation of  both  the  soluble  and 
insoluble  FEC  decomposition  products  in  the  SEI  on silicon  nan-
owires (SiNWs). The SiNWs were chosen as they can be studied in 
the absence of binder to simplify the analysis. SiNWs were subject-
ed to a constant current for long-term cycling to electrochemically 
generate  sufficient  SEI  for  structural  characterization.  In  order  to 
overcome  the  inherently  low  sensitivity  of  NMR,  we  synthesized 
uniformly  labeled  13C3 FEC  and  performed  ssNMR  experiments 

with dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancement to provide 
a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  organic  SEI.    Our 
results  clearly  show  that  chemically  distinct  intermediates  are 
formed in both the soluble and insoluble SEI products upon addi-
tion  of  FEC  that  may  be  responsible  for  increased  stability  in  the 
presence of this additive.  

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 

Synthesis of  13C3-fluoroethylene carbonate.13C3 FEC was synthesized 
from  13C3  EC  via  chlorination  of  EC  and  subsequent  fluorination  using 
standard  Schlenk  techniques  under  N2-atmosphere.13C3  EC  (200 mg, 
2.27 mmol, 1.00 eq.) was suspended in 5 mL of carbon tetrachloride. Sulfu-
ryl  chloride  (0.19 mL,  2.38 mmol,  1.05 eq.)  and  azobisisobutyronitrile 
(AIBN)  (15 mg,  0.91 mmol,  0.04 eq.)  were  added  and  the  further  AIBN 
was added twice every 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was left stirring at 
65 °C for 16 h before the solvent was removed in vacuo and the liquid resi-
due  was  purified  by  column  purification  (silica  100:1,  dichloromethane, 
Rf = 0.50).  13C3-Chloroethylene carbonate (180 mg, 1.47 mmol, 65%) was 
received as a clear colorless liquid.  

Anhydrous  potassium  fluoride  (2.50 g,  43.0 mmol,  29.3 eq.)  was  sus-
pended  in  7 mL  of  acetonitrile  abs.  and  13C3-chloroethylene  carbonate 
(180 mg,  1.47 mmol,  1.00 eq.),  dissolved  in  3 mL  acetonitrile  abs.,  was 
added.  The  mixture  was  stirred  at  75 °C  for  16 h,  filtered,  and  the  solid 
residue was washed with 10 mL of acetonitrile. The filtrates were combined 
and  the  solvent  was  removed  in  vacuo.  The  dark  liquid  was  purified  by 
column  purification  (silica  100:1,  dichloromethane,  Rf = 0.45).  13C3  FEC 
(40 mg, 0.38 mmol, 26 %) was separated as a clear colorless liquid.  

Synthesis of silicon nanowires. Silicon nanowires were synthesized by 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as previously described22. Briefly, 50 nm 
gold was thermal-sputtered onto 20 µm-thick stainless steel (SUS304, Agar 
Scientific)  foil.  The  gold-coated  stainless  steel  foil  was  cut  into  1×1  cm2 
substrates, which were transferred into the CVD chamber. The substrates 
were  heated  in  1  mBar  of  argon  atmosphere  at  510-530  °C  for  10  min  to 
anneal the gold catalyst. After annealing, a mixture of argon and silane gases 
(Ar / SiH4= 100 sccm / 20 sccm) was introduced. The growth was carried 
out  in  15 mBar  at  510 – 530 ˚C  for  15  min.  The  substrates  were  weighed 
before and after CVD growth to determine the mass of SiNWs. The aver-
age mass loading of SiNWs was around 0.5-0.8 mg/cm2. 

Electrolyte  preparation  and  coin  cell  assembly.  The  five  different 
electrolyte  formulations  used  here  are  listed  in  Table  1.  The  LP30  +  13C3 
EC enrichment of electrolytes was prepared by mixing 13C3 EC with a non-
labeled EC/DMC in a 1:1:2 v/v/v ratio, then dissolving the LiPF6 salt into 
the solvent to achieve a final concentration of 1 M. The LP30 + FEC and 
LP30  +  13C3  FEC  electrolytes  were  prepared  by  either  adding  0.5  mL  of 
FEC or 13C3 FEC into 5 ml of commercial LP30 electrolyte. All the electro-
lytes were stored in aluminum bottles.

SiNWs electrodes were then assembled into Li-half 2032 coin cells using 
the  five  electrolytes.  Porous  glass  fiber  mats  (Whatman  GF/B,  B  1 mm 
thick) were used as separators and around 10 drops (~ 0.2 mL) of electro-
lyte were used for each cell. All the assembling procedures were carried out 
in an Ar filled glovebox (H2O < 0.1ppm, O2 < 0.1ppm). The coin cells were 
discharged/charged  at  constant  current  (C/30,  120  mA/g)  between 

 
 
 
0.001 V – 2 V regions for 1st and 30th cycles using a Biologic VSP or MPG-2. 
Approximately  50  days  were  needed  to  complete  30  cycles.  The  slow  cy-
cling  protocol  ensures  that  the  electrolyte  solvents  are  being  held  at  low 
voltage for sufficiently long time for extensive SEI formation. The electro-
chemical results obtained for the enriched electrolyte were similar to those 
of  the  non-enriched  electrolyte:  the  cycling  performance  is  mainly  influ-
enced by the presence of FEC.  

Solution  NMR.  After the SiNW coin cells finished the 1st and 30th cy-
cles,  the  cells  were  disassembled  in  an  Ar  filled  glovebox.  The  glass  fiber 
separators  were  extracted  and  soaked  in  0.75 mL  DMSO-d6  for  2-3 min. 
The solution was then transferred to an airtight J-Young tube. Spectra were 
recorded on a 500 MHz Bruker Avance III HD, with a DCH (carbon ob-
serve)  cryoprobe  or  Bruker  AVANCE  400  equipped  with  a  BBO  probe. 
Detailed information about the pulse program can be found in SI.  1H and 
13C NMR spectra were internally referenced to DMSO-d6 at 2.50 ppm and 
39.51 ppm, respectively.  

Solid-state  NMR.  After  cell  disassembling,  the  SiNW  electrodes  were 
dried under vacuum overnight (~16-20 h) to remove the DMC and FEC; 
this  procedure  also  removes  most  of  the  EC.23  Note  that  the  electrodes 
were not rinsed. After drying, the SiNW electrodes were scratched from the 
substrate and packed into rotors for ex-situ multinuclear ssNMR measure-
ment.  

1H-13C cross polarization (CP) of LP30 +13C3 EC sample was performed 
on  a  Bruker  Avance  III  700  (16.4 T)  spectrometer  using  a  3.2  mm  HXY 
probe at MAS frequency of 20 kHz, with CP contact time of 1 ms. RF nuta-
tion  frequency  were  (1H)  92.5 kHz  (50 – 100 % linearly  ramped  during 
CP24),  (13C)  82.5 kHz,  and  SPINAL-6425  1H  decoupling  at  80 kHz. 
3482 scans separated by a 3 s recycle interval were acquired over 3 h. The 
LP30  +13C3  FEC  sample  was  measured  on  a  Bruker  Avance  III  HD  500 
(11.7 T) spectrometer using a 2.5 mm HX probe at MAS frequency of 10 
kHz,  with  CP  contact  time  of  2  ms  and  SPINAL-64  1H  decoupling  at 
80 kHz.  24576  scans  separated  by  a  3  s  recycle  delay  were  acquired  over 
20.5 h. The experimental parameters are summarized in Table S2.  1H and 
13C, shifts were externally referenced to adamantane at 1.87 and 38.6 ppm 
(of CH2 group), respectively.  

DNP NMR. The cycled SiNW samples were sealed under Ar and trans-
ferred to the Nottingham DNP MAS NMR Facility in three layers of sealed 
plastic  bag.  The  samples  were  then  quickly  pumped  into  the  N2-filled 
glovebox. Since the SiNWs were in the delithiated state, we assumed that 
there was no reaction between N2 and the electrodes material.  The sample 
was diluted with pre-dried KBr power by mixing homogeneously in a mor-
tar.  Then,  a  minimum  amount  of  radical  solution  (4 mM  TEKPol  in  1,2-
dichlorobenzene,  DCB)26,27  was  added  to  wet  the  powder.  The  resulting 
paste-like  samples  were  packed  into  the  center  of  3.2  mm  sapphire  MAS 
rotors  and  sealed  with  a  PTFE  film.  The  rotor  was  capped  with  a  Vespel 
drive cap and quickly inserted into the pre-cooled DNP NMR probehead 
for measurement. The sample mass, dilution ratio of KBr, and the volume 
of the radical solution are listed in Table S1. 

All DNP NMR experiments were performed on a 14.09 T AVANCE III 
HD  spectrometer,  corresponding  to  1H  Larmor  frequency  of  600  MHz, 
with  a  395  GHz  gyrotron  microwave  (MW)  source  and  using  a  3.2  mm 
triple resonance wide-bore probe. All experiments were performed at 12.5 
kHz  MAS  frequency.  A  microwave  source  power  of  11  W  (at  the  source, 

equivalent to 110 mA collector current) was used for  1H-13C DNP experi-
ments. All MW on/off experiments were performed with a train of satura-
tion pulses prior to a longitudinal relaxation delay followed by signal excita-
tion. The characteristic build up time of the enhanced  1H polarization was 
measured via a saturation recovery experiment. The 1H enhancement ratios 
with microwave on and off are listed in Table S1.  1H-13C CP experiments 
were performed with 90 – 100 % ramp on the 1H channel and 100 kHz 1H 
decoupling  using  swept-frequency  two-pulse  phase  modulation  (SWf  -
TPPM)  sequence28.  The  relaxation  delay  in  the  CP  experiments  varied 
between  4 - 7  s,  with  a  CP  contact  time  of  2  ms.  1H  chemical  shifts  were 
referenced externally to the 1H and 13C (of CH2 group) resonances of ada-
mantane  set  at  1.8  and  38.6  ppm,  respectively.  Note  for  the  LP30  +13C3 
FEC  sample,  only  1 mg  was  used  for  measurement.  The  small  sample 
amount is due to the small quantity of the 13C3 FEC that was obtained from 
the synthesis. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  

Electrochemistry. The electrochemical performance of SiNWs 
cycled in LP30 and LP30 + FEC electrolytes is shown in Figure 1. 
In  Figure  1a,  discharge/charge  (lithiaton/delithiation)  capacities 
on  the  order  of  the  theoretical  capacity  of  Si  (3579 mAh/g)  were 
obtained  for  both  LP30  and  LP30  +  FEC  electrolytes  during  the 
first  two  cycles.  However,  over  long-term  cycling,  obvious  devia-
tions are observed between LP30 and LP30 + FEC samples. At the 
30th  cycle,  the  LP30  sample  exhibits  only  55%  capacity  retention 
whereas, the LP30 + FEC sample retains 89% of the initial charge 
capacity (Figure 1b).  

The  voltage  profile  of  SiNWs  cycled  in  LP30  and  LP30 + FEC 
during  the  first  two  cycles  are  similar  (Figure  1a,  left),  indicating 
that  both  systems  undergo  similar  structural  transformations  dur-
ing  the  initial  discharge/charge  cycles.  During  the  first  discharge, 
the voltage quickly drops from the open circuit voltage (OCV) to 
0.2 V with a small lithiation capacity, suggesting little SEI formation 
on  the  SiNWs  from  OCV  to  0.2  V.    The  dQ/dV  plot  (Figure  1a, 
right) reveals the reduction process of FEC at 1.2 V and the reduc-
tion  of  EC  at  0.8V  during  the  1st  cycle.  A  flat  discharge  profile  is 
then  observed  at  approximately  0.1  V,  which  corresponds  to  the 
conversion  of  crystalline  Si  to  amorphous  lithium  silicide  (a-
LixSi).29  Further  lithiation  results  in  the  formation  of  crystalline 
 (c-Li15Si4), which is manifested as a characteristic process at 
Li15Si4
approximately 0.4 V in the charge voltage curve. The 0.4 V process 
corresponds  to  the  delithiation  of  c-Li15Si4  and  the  formation  of 
amorphous  silicon  (a-Si).30  The  c-Li15Si4  phase  is  highly  reactive 
and  induces  severe  electrolyte  decomposition.31  For  the  second 
discharge,  the  SiNWs  show  a  voltage  profile  characteristic  of  a-Si.

Soluble  degradation  products  as  measured  by  solution 
NMR. Electrolytes from cells after the 1st and 30th cycles were com-
pared  with  pristine  electrolytes  using  1H  solution  NMR  spectros-
copy  (Figure  2)  and  a  series  of  two  dimensional  (2D)  correlation 
experiments.  Several  new  1H  NMR  signals  were  detected  in  the 
cycled LP30 electrolyte between 3 - 5 ppm (Figure 2a) that are not 
present  in  the  FEC-containing  samples  (Figure  2b,c)  indicating 
that very different soluble breakdown products are formed.  In the 
LP30  samples,  these  include  an  intense  singlet  at  4.30 ppm  that 
appears  after  the  1st  cycle  (yellow  shading)  and  several  multiplets 
(blue  shading,  labeled  from  a-d)  at  4.19,  3.62,  3.52  and  3.4 –  3.1 
ppm.  

The singlet at 4.30 ppm is assigned to lithium ethylene dicarbonate 
(LEDC),33  which  is  supported  by  2D  1H-13C  heteronuclear  single 
quantum  correlation  (HSQC)  and  1H-13C  heteronuclear  multiple 
bond correlation (HMBC) experiments performed on cycled LP30 
electrolytes  extracted  from  Li  symmetric  cells  (Figure  S3,  experi-
mental details described in SI) as well as previously reported DFT 
shift calculations.34 LEDC is a decomposition product of EC, which 
is formed via a ring-opening reduction of EC, followed by a dimeri-
zation and the elimination of ethylene gas (Scheme 2.1).35 Interest-
ingly, LEDC disappears by the 30th cycle, suggesting that LEDC is a 
metastable species that decomposes upon further cycling. Decom-
position  of  LEDC  is  consistent  with  theoretical  predictions  that 
indicate that LEDC is thermodynamically unstable on contact with 
the lithiated silicides.36,37  

The multiplets labeled a-d are assigned to oligomers comprising 
different 
i.e.,  R-
linear  polyethylene  oxide  (PEO)  species, 
OCH2CH2O- /R’-OCH3 groups.  Similar PEO species or oligomers 
have been previously detected by mass spectroscopies.38–40 We find 
that  these  oligomers  are  extremely  sensitive  to  trace  amounts  of 
water, with noticeable changes in 1H NMR peak positions as well as 
the emergence of new signals as moisture permeates the nominally 
airtight NMR tube (Figure S2).    

The 1H NMR spectra of the LP30 + FEC electrolyte after 30 cy-
cles  exhibits  three  distinct  new  sets  of  resonances  in  the  9.5 -
 9.7 ppm region (three singlets), a singlet at 7.77 ppm, and a cluster 
of multiplets at approximately 5.0 - 6.2 ppm (Figure 2b, shaded red 
and  labeled  x,  y,  and  z,  respectively),  which  are  all  absent  in  the 
LP30  sample  (see  Figure S1  for  the  expanded  1H  NMR  spectra). 
These three sets of resonances are also observed in the cycled LP30 
+ 13C3 FEC with further splitting of the peaks resulting from the 13C 
labeling. Assignment of the species present in the FEC-containing 
samples  was  facilitated  by  a  combination  of  2D  correlation  NMR 
spectroscopy  and  J-coupling  pattern  analysis  of  the  13C-labeled 
sample  (vide  infra).  By  contrast,  the  1D  1H  NMR  spectra  of  the 
LP30 sample only shows a small singlet at 8.42 ppm in this spectral 
region after 30 cycles, which can be assigned to lithium formate on 
the  basis  of  its  unique  chemical  shift.41  Lithium  formate  can  form 
via  reduction  of  CO2  and  proton  abstraction  from  other  organic 
molecules in solution (Scheme 2.3).34 The resonances seen in 5-10 
ppm region in 1H NMR indicate

x  Li+  à  a-LixSi,  where  x  is  approximately  2.5  and  3.5  for  the  pro-
cesses  at  0.25  V  and  0.1  V,  respectively).22  On  the  30th  cycle,  the 
voltage  profiles  of  the  SiNWs  cycled  in  LP30  or  LP30 + FEC  di-
verge (Figure 1a). Here, the SiNWs cycled in the presence of FEC 
maintain a voltage profile that is similar to that of the second cycle. 
In contrast, the onset of lithiation in the 30th cycle of the SiNWs is 
lower in LP30 than LP30+FEC sample as seen more clearly in the 
dQ/dV  plot  (Figure 1a,  30th  cycle),  suggesting  a  larger  internal 
resistance inside the cell. This can be attributed to the formation of 
a  more  resistive  SEI  and  increased  electrode  tortuousity,  which 
limits  Li  ion  diffusion  through  the  bulk  of  the  electrode  and  ulti-
mately  decreases  lithiation  capacity  unless  extremely  low  currents 
are used.23,32  

The  coulombic  efficiency  (CE,  defined  as  delithiation  capacity 
versus  lithiation  capacity)  of  SiNWs  in  LP30  and  LP30 + FEC  is 
compared in Figure 1c. During the first five cycles, the FEC sample 
shows a slightly lower CE than the LP30 sample, which may be due 
to the preferential decomposition of FEC over EC. From cycles 5 -
 30, the average CE of LP30 + FEC is 96.2%, which is an improve-

that  distinct  chemical  species  are  formed  in  the  presence  of  the 
FEC additive that are not formed in LP30 alone. 

In addition to chemical composition, 1H NMR data also provide 
information  on  the  relative  populations  of  electrolyte  breakdown 
products.  In  Figure  2,  the  1H  NMR  resonances  in  the  5 –10 ppm 
region  are  magnified  by  a  factor  of  33,  over  the  3 – 5 ppm  region. 
The  intense  peaks  of  the  degradation  product  seen  in  the  LP30 
sample  (peaks  a-d  in  Figure  2a)  in  the  latter  region  suggest  that 
more  soluble  oligomers  are  present  in  the  electrolyte.  In  contrast, 
the  1H  NMR  peak  intensities  associated  with  the  decomposition 
products found in the LP30 + FEC sample are significantly weaker 
than  those  in  the  LP30  sample,  suggesting  less  soluble  SEI  are 
formed in the presence of FEC. 

Two-dimensional  (2D)  correlation  NMR  spectroscopy  experi-
ments were then performed with  13C3 FEC, in order to carry out a 
more in-depth characterization of the structure of the decomposi-
tion  products,  13C3  FEC  being  synthesized  as  described  in  the  ex-
perimental section using a modification of a published route.42 The 
HSQC  spectrum  of  the  LP30  +  13C3 FEC  samples  (Figure  3a) 
shows  two  cross  peaks  between  the  1H  NMR  signal  at  9.53,  9.34 
ppm and the 13C NMR signals at 188.5, 195.7 ppm, which are con-
sistent with a terminal aldehyde/vinoxyl species, HC(=O)-R.  The 
HMBC spectrum (Figure S7) shows that there are multiple vinoxyl 
oligomers, with the HC(=O) groups being bound to ethylene oxide 
(-CH2O-)  carbons  with  13C  chemical  shifts  of  either  68.3,  71.9  or 
73.8 ppm (all these  13C shifts are consistent with a formula such as 
HC(=O)CH2OR).  The  carbon  connectivity  of  this  structure  is 
further  supported  by  13C-13C  correlation  spectroscopy  (COSY, 
Figure 3b), which shows a cross peak between the vinoxyl carbons 
at 204.0 ppm and the ethyleneoxide carbons (-CH2O-) around 68-
73 ppm (see Table S3 for a summary of all 2D correlation peaks).  

In addition to the vinoxyl species, other soluble components are 
also  observed  in  the  2D  NMR  spectra.  According  to  the  HSQC 
spectrum in Figure 3a, the  1H NMR peak at 7.77 ppm (y) belongs 
to a proton directly bound to a sp2 hybridized carbon (as indicated 
by  the  13C  chemical  shift  of  132.9  ppm).  In  addition,  the  corre-
sponding 1H-13C HMBC spectrum (Figure S7) shows that the pro-
ton giving rise to y is also 2 – 3 bonds away from a carbonate group, 
since a 13C cross peak is observed at 153.8 ppm. Thus y likely origi-
nates from a highly symmetric decomposition product of FEC, e.g., 
either  vinylene  carbonate  (VC)  or  lithium  vinyl  dicarbonate 
(LVDC),  both  of  which  contain 
fragment 
OCH=CHR.  Note  that  in  the  non-labeled  sample  (or  under  13C 
decoupling), a singlet at 7.77 ppm is observed, whereas in the  13C3 
FEC sample, a distinct pattern of multiplets is observed (Figure 2b 
and 2c, region y). Of note, the splitting pattern observed in the 13C 
labeled  sample  contains  further  information  that  allows  us  to  un-
ravel the environments that give rise to the peaks in region y.

perimental 1H NMR spectrum in region y of the cycled LP30 +13C3 
FEC sample is compared with the simulated  13C2 VC spectrum as 
shown in Figure 4. In order to simulate the proton-splitting pattern 
of  13C2  VC,  we  first  extracted  various  J  coupling  constants  (1JCH, 
2JCH,  1JCC,  3JHH,  3JCH)  from  the  1H  NMR  spectrum  of  natural  abun-
dance  VC,  which  is  also  associated  with  a  1H  shift  of  7.77  ppm 
(Figure  S9).  The  experimental  J  coupling  constants  are  listed  on

inset  of  Figure  4a.  These  J  coupling  constants  were  then  used  to 
simulate the 1H NMR spectrum of 13C2 VC, by considering the four 
spin system, AA’XX’ (Figure 4b).  Here, we simplified the simula-
tion by omitting  3JCH and, as a result, neglected the coupling to the 
carbonate  group  even  though  this  sample  originated  from  13C3- 
labeled FEC.  (We note that in an AA’XX’ system, each proton (A) 
is coupled to a different carbon (X), which gives second-order mul-
tiplets  because  1JCH is  different  from  2JCH).  The  appearance  of  the 
spectrum is defined by the four coupling constants (1JCH,  2JCH,  1JCC 
and 3JHH). 

The peak position and its intensity can be calculated as described 
by Pople.43–45 A least squares minimization was carried out to adjust 
the  J  coupling  constants  in  order  to  match  the  experimental  pat-
tern. Figure 4b shows the simulated 13C2 VC pattern with the corre-
sponding  J  coupling  constants.  The  simulation  provides  an  excel-
lent  match  to  the  experimental  spectrum  with  the  exception  that 
the  3JCH  coupling  (9.1  Hz)  is  omitted  since  we  only  considered  a 
four spin system; including this would lead to the observed 9.1 Hz 
splitting  of  all  of  the  peaks.  In  contrast,  LVDC,  which  contains

the molecule, will have a more complex JCH multiplet pattern:  4JCH 
(<10 Hz),46 in addition to  3JCH couplings will exist, leading to addi-
tional splitting of the 1H signals (a doublet of doublets).  Therefore, 
we can assign region y to VC and not LVDC.  LVDC is also exclud-
ed  on  the  basis  of  the  measured  3JHH value  (1.5  Hz),  this  coupling 
constant  likely  arising  from  a  cis  conformation  (as  in  VC)  rather 
than a trans one, which would be associated with a larger  3JHH val-

 Assignment  of  Branched  Oligomers  and  Vinoxyl  Species:  
The  third  region,  labeled  z,  in  the  1H  NMR  of  the  cycled  LP30  + 
13C3 FEC sample shows multiplets at 6.07, 5.88, 5.78, and 5.20 ppm 
(which  are  labeled  as  z1,  z2,  z3  and  z4  in  Figure  3a).  From  the 
peaks observed in the HSQC spectrum, the  1H resonances z1 and 
z2  are  connected  to  carbon  resonances  at  99.1  and  100.6  ppm, 
respectively. These resonance can be assigned to a protonated car-
bon with two oxygen groups attached (-CH(OR)2) on the basis of 
its  chemical  shift  (and  its  similarity  to  the  shifts  found  in  polysac-
charides  with  similar  local  environments48).  In  the  13C-13C  COSY 
(Figure 3b) the branched carbons at 100.3 and 98.8 ppm are direct-
ly bound to the ethylene oxide carbon at 70.2 ppm (Figure S8 for 
details),  suggesting  a  motif  structure:  ROCH2CH(OR)2.  This  key 
observation is indicative of the formation of branched oligomers in 
the FEC-  

 
(RT)  using  conventional  ssNMR  and  the  spectra  acquired  with 
DNP NMR at 100 K. All DNP spectra show intense DCB solvent 
peaks  between  120 - 140  ppm  with  the  corresponding  spinning 
sidebands at 40-55 ppm (Figure 5) due to the addition of the DNP 
biradical solution (4 mM TEKPol in DCB).  Apart from these sol-
vent peaks, there is no obvious difference in the species detected via 
ssNMR and DNP NMR, suggesting that the biradical solution has 
not  

altered the chemical structure of the SEI. Moreover, the sensitivity 
provided by low temperature DNP is obvious - the room tempera-
ture (RT) spectrum of the LP30 + 13C3 FEC sample took approxi-
mately  20 h,  whereas,  under  DNP  conditions  (100  K),  a  similar 
signal-to-noise  ratio  spectrum  was  achieved  within 1.3  h  –  and  al-

tion (HETCOR) experiments (Figure 6). 

LP30: The 13C NMR spectrum of LP30 containing 25 vol % en-
riched  EC  (LP30  +  13C3  EC,  Figure  5a)  is  dominated  by  a  broad 
peak at 68 ppm with a shoulder at 61 ppm. In addition, a semicar-
bonate resonance at 160 ppm is observed.  The shoulder at 61 ppm 
becomes  sharper  in  the  spectrum  acquired  with  DNP  at  100  K, 
likely due to reduced dynamics of the organic SEI species at lower 
temperatures,  as  observed  in  our  previous  DNP  experiments  per-
formed  on  graphene  electrodes.49  The  broad  13C  resonance  at  68 
ppm  (labeled  C1)  is  correlated  to  a  proton  at  4.5  ppm  in  the 
HETCOR  (Figure  6a),  allowing  C1  to  be  assigned  to  either  the 
carbon  in  ethylene  oxide  (-CH2CH2O-)  or  to  residual  EC.  The 
shoulder  at  61  ppm  in  the  13C  ssNMR  spectrum  (labeled  C2) 
shows  a  one-bond  correlation  to  a  proton  resonance  at  approxi-
mately 3.75 ppm, and is assigned to an ethylene oxide carbon with a 
terminal  alcohol  (RCH2OH).34  Three  other  local  maxima  are  ob-
served in the HETCOR spectra between C1 and C2 (numbered 3, 
4 and 5 in Figure S13), the different shifts possibly being a result of 
different PEO chain lengths and/or a variation in terminal groups 
of polyethylene oxide. The intensity of aliphatic carbons in both the 
conventional  and  DNP  13C  NMR  spectra  is  low,  which  suggests 
that  the  SEI  formed  here  primarily  consists  of  polyethylene  oxide 
that contains few aliphatic units. 

LP30  +  FEC: Similar carbon environments at 68 ppm and 160 
ppm  are  observed  in  the  spectrum  of  LP30  with  10  vol  %  of  13C-
enriched  FEC  (LP30  +13C3  FEC,  Figure  5b),  along  with  two  new 
peaks:  a  13C  resonance  at  103  ppm  that  is  present  in  both  the 
ssNMR and DNP, as well as a weak resonance at approximately 34 
ppm that is much more clearly resolved in the DNP spectrum. The 
main  peak  at  68  ppm  has  a  different  peakshape  compared  to  that 
observed  in  the  LP30  +  13C3  EC  spectrum,  and  no  shoulder  at  61 
ppm  is  observed.    The  signal  at  68  ppm  in  the  RT  spectrum  is 
broadened near the baseline, possibly indicating that two peaks are 
superimposed in this region. We hypothesize that the sharp peak at 
68 ppm is due to residual EC.  The broader component of the peak 
as well as the 13C resonance at 68 ppm is consistent with a distribu-
tion  of  different  ethylene  oxide  environments  (-CH2CH2O-).34  In 
contrast  to  the  LP30 + 13C3  EC  sample,  the  SEI  signal  at  68  ppm 
becomes  broader  when  measured  at  100  K  (Figure  5b).    Here, 
spectral broadening may be a result of sample

containing electrolyte,which appears after prolonged cycling.  

Similarly, structural assignments for 1H NMR at z3 and z4 can be 
made.  1H  resonance  at  z3  is  connected  to  a  13C  resonance  at  65.8 
ppm  in  the  HSQC  spectrum  and  the  protons  are  2-3  bonds  away 
from  carbons  with  13C  resonances  at  66.4  and  153.2  ppm  in  the 
HMBC spectrum. These resonances can be assigned to a branched 
carbon  near  a  carbonate  group  and  two  ethylene  oxide  groups 
(ROCOOCH(CH2OR’)2) based on the their chemical shifts. The 
proton with  1H resonance at z4 is bound to a carbon at 66.7 ppm. 
In HMBC, z4 is further bonded to 13C at 68.2 and 203.3 ppm. The 
chemical structure of z4 can be assigned to the methylene units in 
the  vinoxyl  species  (HC(=O)CH2OCH2R),  which  confirms  the 
identification of the vinoxyl species in region x (see Table S3 for a 
summary of all the correlation peaks in solution NMR spectra and 
possible assignments for the LP30+13C3 FEC sample).

close to 100 ppm.48 

The HETCOR spectrum of the FEC-containing sample (Figure 
6b) has three extra peaks at 103, 75-85, and 34 ppm, labeled A, B, 
and D, respectively, which are absent in the LP30 + 13C3 EC sample. 
The  broad  peak,  B,  is  correlated  to  a  1H  peak  at  around  4.5-5.0 
ppm.  At  least  four  components  (B1  –  B4)  can  be  resolved,  which 
are  assigned  to  branched  ethylene  oxide  units  (-CHRO-;  see 
Scheme 3) with different substituting groups or chain lengths. The 
13C resonance at 34 ppm (peak D) is correlated a  1H resonance at 
1.3 ppm, and is assigned to RCH2R’ units.  Both the aliphatic units 
(peak D) and the series of resonances round 80 ppm (peak B) are 
only  present  in  the  FEC  containing  sample  and  imply  that  the 
structure that originates from FEC is more complex than a simple 
linear ethylene oxide polymer.   

In  the  HETCOR  spectrum,  the  peak  at  103  ppm  (peak  A)  is 
bound to protons that resonate between 4.2 - 5.2 ppm, and can be 
assigned to a protonated carbonate bound to two oxygens based on 
prior DFT shift calculations of proposed cross-linked VC polymers7 
(see  Scheme  3).  This  unique  chemical  shift  is  consistent  with 
branched structures and was observed in the spectrum of chemical-
ly reduced FEC.7 The peak at 103 ppm is not due to residual FEC 
as no FEC was detected by 19F ssNMR (Figure S10).  Interestingly, 
similar  resonances  were  also  detected  in  solution  NMR  of  cycled 
LP30  +  FEC  electrolyte  (resonance  z1  and  z2:  the  proton  at  5.78 
ppm is bonded to a carbon at 100 ppm in HSQC, Figure 3a), sug-
gesting that these might be the precursors that eventually form the 
insoluble,  higher  molecular  weight  SEI  polymers  as  will  be  dis-
cussed  later.  Similar  cross-linking  units  are  present  as  glycosidic 

DISCUSSION 

Different  electrolytes  with  13C3  enriched  EC  and/or  13C3  en-
riched  FEC  were  cycled  in  SiNW  half-cells  to  study  the  organic 
electrolyte  degradation  products.  FEC-containing  electrolytes  dis-
play  an  obvious  improvement  on  the  cycle  life  of  Si  anode  com-
pared  to  electrolytes  that  do  not  contain  FEC.  The  SiNWs  cells 
were stopped at the delithiated state after the 1st and 30th cycle for 
ex-situ  NMR  analysis.  The  cycled  electrolytes  were  examined  by 
solution  NMR  and  the  electrodes  by  solid-state  and  DNP  NMR 
spectroscopies.  Both  soluble  and  insoluble  chemical  structures 
detected  in  LP30  samples  with  and  without  FEC  are  listed  in 
Schemes 2-3 along with possible formation reactions.  

For  the  LP30  sample,  soluble  products  such  as  LEDC,  lithium 
formate and PEO-type oligomers are detected in the cycled electro-
lyte and their respective formation pathways are shown in Scheme 
2. The insoluble SEI that forms from LP30 mainly consists of eth-
ylene oxides (-CH2CH2O-), ethylene oxides with hydroxide termi-
nal  units  (RCH2OH)  and  carbonate  (-OCOO-)  units.  The  pres-
ence  of  these  ethylene  oxide  species  is  consistent  with  the  PEO-
type  and  lithium  alkyl  carbonate  polymers  formed  from  EC  that 
were reported by Shkrob.52  

Previous  works  on  EC  decomposition53–55  suggest  that  EC  can 
undergo  one-electron  ring-opening  reduction  to  form  a  lithium 
alkyl  carbonate  anion  radical  (Scheme  2.1).  The  radical  can  then 
dimerize  and  form  LEDC  with  concurrent  loss  of  ethylene  gas,

detected by GC-MS (Scheme 2.1).58 To form oligomer or polymers, 
the alkyl carbonate radical anion can elongate the chain via a nucle-
ophilic attack on the EC. Alternatively, it can lose CO2, forming an 
ethylene  oxide  radical  anion  (CH2CH2O-).56  This  radical  anion 
can  also  attack  EC  to  initiate  anionic  polymerization  (Scheme 
2.2).56 In either case, the resulting polymer will primarily consist of 
linear  carbonates  and  ethylene  oxide  units  which  are  consistent 
with  the  ssNMR  data  in  this  study  as  well  as  those  published  in 
previous  report.23  During  these  processes,  lithium  formate  can  be 
formed by the reduction of CO2, resulting in a lithium carbon diox-
ide  radical  with  subsequent  hydrogen  abstraction  from  other  spe-
cies in the solution (Scheme 2.3).7   

Short-chain  lithium  alkyl  carbonates  such  as  LEDC  are  highly 
soluble  and  thus  are  unable  to  protect  the  Si  anode,  as  they  are 
easily  detected  in  the  cycled  electrolyte.  LEDC  is  only  transiently 
detected in the 1st cycle electrolyte and not in the long-term cycled 
electrolyte, confirming its instability.36 Significant amounts of PEO-
type  oligomers  are  present  in  the  electrolyte  after  prolonged  cy-
cling, which suggests that the SEI derived from LP30 is highly solu-
ble.  The  existence  of  these  soluble  degradation  products  also  sug-
gest that they are unable to adhere to the Si surface and thus pre-
vent  further  electrolyte  decomposition.    The  instability  of  the  SEI 
formed  from  LP30  contributes  to  the  irreversible  consumption  of 
lithium and it agrees well with the capacity fading observed in the 
electrochemistry of the LP30 sample (Figure 1b). 

The insoluble polymeric SEI formed from LP30 contains similar 
chemical  units  to  those  detected  in  the  solution  NMR.  Note  that 
significant  amounts  of  hydroxide-terminated  groups  (RCH2OH) 
are detected in the ssNMR of the LP30 sample, which is consistent 
with previous study.23 Hydroxide terminal units can be formed via 
protonation of the alkoxide (RCH2O-) or by the hydrolysis of lithi-
um alkyl carbonate (Scheme 2.4).54,57 Although the 13C CP NMR is 
not quantitative, the long contact time used in the experiments here 
(1-2 ms) ensures a homogenized  1H polarization transfer through-
out  the  molecule,  allowing  a  semi-quantitative  comparison.  The 
higher percentage of hydroxide-terminated carbon versus ethylene 
oxide  carbon  in  the  LP30  sample  suggests  a  higher  population  of 
polymers  with  shorter  chain  lengths  compared  to  highly  polymer-
ized  PEO  species.  Such  short-chain  polymers/oligomers  are  likely 
to  be  chemically  similar  to  the  oligomers  detected  in  the  cycled 
electrolyte  (peak  a-d  in  Figure  1a).  These  short-chain  polymers 
derived from EC do not appear to be able to form a stable SEI on 
the Si anode and help to prevent further electrolyte breakdown.  

Very different chemical motifs were detected in the solution and 
solid-state  NMR  of  the  FEC-containing  sample  (Scheme  3,  top). 
Specifically, minor amounts of vinoxyl species, VC, and a possible 
cross-linking  site  are  present  as  the  soluble  products  in  the  cycled 
electrolyte.  Note  that  PEO-type  oligomers  were  not  detected  by 
solution  NMR  in  the  FEC  sample.  The  absence  of  soluble  PEO-
type  species  suggests  that  FEC  can  effectively  suppress  the  for-
mation of soluble oligomers formed in the LP30 sample.  

Vinoxyl species are present in both the 1st and 30th cycle, indicat-
ing that they form during the initial stage of FEC decomposition. In 
contrast,  VC  and  branched  oligomers  are  only  found  in  the  30th 
cycle of the FEC-containing sample. We speculate that VC may be 
highly  reactive  and  thus,  rapidly  being  consumed  to  form  other 
species  in  the  initial  formation  cycles.  However,  after  long-term 
cycling,  a  stable  SEI  forms  and  VC  begins  to  accumulate  in  the 
electrolyte. The conversion of FEC to VC that we observed is also 

consistent  with  the  mechanistic  studied  performed  by  Balbuena 
and  co-workers  using  density  functional  theory  and  ab  initio  mo-
lecular  dynamics  simulations  methods.59  The  branched  soluble 
oligomers detected in the cycled electrolyte appear to be similar to 
the  species  present  in  the  insoluble  portion  of  the  SEI,  but  with 
shorter chain lengths (i.e. lower molecular weight species and high-
er  solubility;  they  therefore  saturate  in  the  electrolyte  and  likely 
prevent further SEI dissolution). The soluble components may also 
serve as precursor for the insoluble SEI polymers. Another possibil-
ity is that the chemical structures of the soluble oligomers are dif-
ferent  from  the  insoluble  polymer  as  they  are  formed  by  different 
reactions.  Certain  pathways  lead  to  short-chain  oligomers,  while 
other reactions form insoluble polymer.  

The  insoluble  SEI  products  formed  from  the  FEC-containing 
sample  are  consistent  with  ethylene  oxides  and  carbonate  species 
along  with  the  minor  structural  features  as  follows:  acetal  carbons 
(with  13C  chemical  shift  at  103  ppm),  branched  ethylene  oxides 
(with 13C chemical shift at 75-85 ppm), and aliphatic carbons (with 
13C chemical shift at 34 ppm), which are shaded in red, yellow and 
green,  respectively  (Scheme  3,  top).  The  observation  of  ethylene 
oxides  and  carbonate  species  is  consistent  with  prior  NMR,7 
XPS14,15 and FTIR studies10. 

Scheme  3  summarizes  the  possible  reduction  reactions  of  FEC, 
which  are  based  on  the  species  detected  in  this  study  and  prior 
experimental  and  theoretical  work.  First,  FEC  is  defluorinated, 
forming  an  EC  radical  (denoted  as  radical  A)  and  LiF  (Scheme 
3.1),  as  proposed  by  Nie.35  As  fluorinated  carbon  species  are  not 
detected by solution or solid-state NMR (Figure S10), we suggest 
that  FEC  defluorinates  prior  to  further  reaction.  At  this  stage,  the 
formed  EC  radical  can  abstract  hydrogen  from  other  species  in 
solution and convert back to EC.  Alternatively, the EC radicals can 
disproportionate  to  form  VC  and  EC.  Experiments  using  mass 
spectrometry  in  conjunction  with  additional  NMR  to  compare 
decomposition  products  using  unlabeled  and  13C-labeled  EC  and 
FEC are currently underway in our laboratory to determine which 
reaction pathway is occurring and will be reported in a future study. 
If the EC radicals disproportionate to form VC and EC in the LP30 
+  13C3  FEC  sample,  the  13C3-labeled  EC  that  is  generated  can  be 
reduced as suggested in Scheme 2 and subsequently contribute to 
the PEO-type signal that is detected in 13C ssNMR (Figure 5a).  

Radical A is identical to the radical that results from EC via H ab-
straction. However, although its existence has been proposed, such 
cyclic  EC  radicals  have  not  been  experimentally  observed  in  the 
absence  of  FEC  or  VC,  even  under  cryogenic  conditions  (77  K) 
during the irradiation of EC.52 The inability of EC to form such an 
EC radical may be one explanation for the difference in the decom-
position products seen with EC and FEC. Once formed, radical A 
can lose hydrogen to form VC, otherwise, radical A can lose CO2, 
forming the vinoxyl radicals as shown in Scheme 3.1. 

Due  to  resonance,  there  are  two  forms  of  the  vinoxyl  radicals: 
one with the radical center on the carbon (CH(=O)CH2, radical 
B)  and  the  other  with  the  radical  center  on  the  oxygen 
(OCH=CH2, radical C). While the vinoxyl radicals have not been 
directly detected in this work, such radicals have been observed in a 
radiolysis  experiment  on  FEC  and  were  proposed  to  initiate  the 
formation  of  highly  cross-linked  polymer.18  Because  our  NMR 
results  only  revealed  stable  vinoxyl  species  instead  of  unstable 
vinoxyl  radicals,  we  now  propose  possible  reaction  schemes  that 
result in the formation of vinoxyl species as well as some branched 

 
units  with  predicted  chemical  shifts  similar  to  those  observed  ex-
perimentally  (Scheme  3.2 - 3.8).  Vinoxyl  species  can,  for  example, 
be formed by the vinoxyl radicals (either B or C) attacking the sp2 
hybridized carbon in VC. When radical B reacts with VC (Scheme 
3.2),  it  can  form  a  structure  that  contains  an  aldehyde  terminal 
group, an aliphatic carbon, and a branched ethylene oxide (shaded 
in  blue,  green  and  yellow,  respectively,  with  corresponding  NMR 
parameters  given).  If  VC  reacts  with  radical  C  (Scheme  3.3),  the 
radical  will  be  transformed  into  a  stabilized  carbon  radical,  which 
has a branched acetal carbon (shaded in red) and an alkene termi-
nation. These newly formed radicals (in the form of RCH R’) can 
abstract  H  from  other  species  in  solution  to  stabilize  themselves 
(forming RCH2R’). Alternatively, these secondary radicals can then 
further react with the vinyl group in VC to form poly(VC).7,37,58  

Note  that  neither  alkene  units  (13C  shifts  at  120-140  ppm)  nor 
aldehyde  carbon  (13C  shift  at  200  ppm)  are  observed  by  ssNMR. 
We hypothesize that such terminations can be consumed by further 
reacting with the vinoxyl radical and resulting in chain elongation.60 
Such terminal groups would be present in very low quantities and 
therefore,  below  the  detection  limit  of  ssNMR.  Furthermore,  de-
composition  products  that  contain  alkene  terminal  units  can  un-
dergo reactions similar to that of VC (Scheme 3.4 and 3.5), form-
ing a mixture of polymer products that is consistent with the cross-
linked species detected in this study.  

Interestingly, the chemical structures observed in solution can be 
rationalized  by  considering  the  radical  attack  of  the  aldehyde  ter-
minal group. When radical B reacts with a molecular with an alde-
hyde  group  (Scheme  3.6),  a  new  radical  containing  the  vinoxyl 
units (CH(=O)CH2OR, shaded in blue) is formed. When the sec-
ondary radical formed from Scheme 3.5 attacks an aldehyde group 
(Scheme  3.7),  a  cross-link  containing  the  acetal  carbon  forms 
(ROCH2CH(OR)2,  shaded  in  red).  These  two  chemical  units  are 
consistent  with  the  soluble  products  identified  by  solution  NMR 
(Figure  3).  We  speculate  that  the  radical  attack  on  the  aldehyde 
group  will  lead  to  oligomers  that  have  short-chain  lengths  and  re-
main solubilized. In contrast, radical attack on the alkene terminal 
group is more likely to form higher molecular-weight polymers that 
are incorporated into the insoluble portion of the SEI. 

The  reduced  EC  intermediate  (alkyl  carbonate  anion  radical) 
can also react with the alkene carbon as illustrated in Scheme 3.8. 
The anion radical (RCH2) that forms from reduced EC can attack 
the  alkene  group  and  graft  the  PEO  chain  to  the  decomposition 
products of FEC. If it occurs, this reaction also consumes the anion 
radicals  and  reduces  the  possibility  of  anionic  polymerization  of 
EC. In Scheme 3.8, RCH2R’ (shaded in green) could, in principle, 
originate  from  the  decomposition  of  EC.  To  determine  whether 
this  reaction  takes  place,  13C  CP  NMR  of  the  SiNWs  cycled  in 
LP30  + 13C3 EC + FEC  (see  Table  1  for  electrolyte  formulation) 
was  performed.  The  resulting  13C  CP  NMR  spectrum  shows  an 
extra set of resonances that span the range of 15 – 40 ppm (Figure 
S11). The presence of additional  13C NMR peaks in the region of 
15 – 40 ppm strongly suggests that EC contributes to the formation 
of the aliphatic carbon signal and is consistent with the mechanism 
proposed in Scheme 3.8.  

Although  alkene  termination  is  not  directly  observed  in  solid-
state  NMR,  we  speculate  that  sp2  carbon/alkene  termination  is 
necessary to create the cross-linked polymer, and may play an im-
portant  role  in  capacity  retention  in  general.  Recent  reports  indi-
cate that novel additives, such as methylene ethylene carbonate that 

contain sp2 hybridized carbons show promise for increasing capaci-
ty  retention  in  LIBs.61,62  The  SEI  formed  in  the  presence  of  FEC 
clearly  shows  cross-linked  species,  whereas  the  SEI  formed  in  the 
standard  EC/DMC  electrolyte  mainly  contains  linear  PEO-type 
polymers, providing a molecular rationale for the observed increase 
in  capacity  retention  in  LIBs  when  FEC  additive  is  used.  Similar 
cross-linking units are also present as glycosidic linkages in natural 
polysaccharides,  (which  exhibit  similar  13C  resonances  at  approxi-
mately 100 ppm48) many of which have been successfully demon-
strated  as  a  binder  for  Si  to  improve  capacity  retention,  further 
suggesting  that  this  structural  motif  may  impart  stability  to  the 
SEI.63–65  

The  mechanical  properties  of  the  branched  polymer  derived 
from  FEC  may  be  more  elastic,  which  can  accommodate  the  vol-
ume expansion that occurs in Si during cycling. Additional experi-
ments  are  required  to  determine  whether  the  polymers  formed 
from  FEC  differ  in  their  Li  ion  conductivity  than  the  linear  PEO-
like species formed from EC and whether the reduced overpoten-
tials seen on cycling in the presence of FEC are due to a thinner SEI 
or to improved Li transport.   

CONCLUSION 

Organic species in the SEI on SiNWs were characterized by solu-
tion and solid-state NMR to understand the role of FEC as an elec-
trolyte  additive  in  performance  enhancement  in  LIBs.  After  long-
term  cycling,  the  standard  EC/DMC  electrolyte  decomposes  and 
forms  a  variety  of  soluble  oligomers  in  addition  to  the  transient 
formation  of  LEDC.  The  addition  of  FEC  into  the  electrolyte  al-
lows the formation of a stable SEI and suppresses the decomposi-
tion of EC/DMC, resulting in increased coulombic efficiency after 
the first few cycles.  The 1H and 13C NMR spectra provide compel-
ling evidence for the defluorination of FEC to form soluble vinoxyl 
species  (HCOCH2OR)  and  VC.  Importantly,  we  emphasize  that 
we  have  conclusively  shown  that  FEC  converts  to  VC  instead  of 
LVDC by 1H NMR using 13C-labeled FEC. Oligomers with charac-
teristic peaks that can be assigned to protonated carbons bonded to 
two  adjacent  oxygen  groups  due  to  cross-linking  units  were  also 
identified. These oligomeric precursors presumably react further to 
form  insoluble  polymeric  species  in  the  SEI,  with  similar  cross-
linking  groups.    Neither  these  cross-linking  units  nor  the  vinoxyl 
species are observed in the absence of the FEC additive.   

The vinoxyl species are signatures for the formation of the vinox-
yl radicals that are believed to initiate the polymerization that even-
tually results in a highly cross-linked network.18  While the study of 
Shkrob et al. focused on the reduction products of FEC alone,18 we 
too,  detect  similar  vinoxyl  species  and  cross-linking  motifs  when 
FEC is used as an additive in EC-containing electrolytes. Based on 
our  NMR  results,  we  find  that  the  stepwise  elimination  of  CO2 
results  in  a  polymeric  species  that  contains  a  mixture  of  aliphatic 
units (13C shifts at 34 ppm) and cross-linking motifs (13C shifts at 
103  ppm)  similar  to  poly(VC),  with  several  regions  of  PEO-type 
structures. Overall, FEC breakdown products (e.g. increased popu-
lation  of  cross-linking  moieties)  lead  to  a  suppression  of  soluble, 
linear  PEO-type  polymeric  products  that  occur  in  the  standard 
cycled LP30 electrolyte. 

We speculate that the formation of cross-linked polymers is key 
to the higher stability of SEI formed on Si in the presence of FEC, 
motivating  studies  with  additives  that  may  promote  cross-linking. 
Further insight into the molecular nature of the SEI and the param-

 
eters  that  impart  stability  offer  the  opportunity  to  tailor  the  SEI 
chemistry to maximize performance in LIBs.
