We report on the fabrication of conducting interfaces between LaAlO3 and
SrTiO3 by 90◦ oﬀ-axis sputtering in an Ar atmosphere. At a growth pressure
of 0.04 mbar the interface is metallic, with a carrier density of the order of
1013 cm−2 at 3 K. By increasing the growth pressure, we observe an increase
of the out-of-plane lattice constants of the LaAlO3 ﬁlms while the in-plane
lattice constants do not change. Also, the low-temperature sheet resistance
increases with increasing growth pressure, leading to an insulating interface
when the growth pressure reaches 0.10 mbar. We attribute the structural
variations to an increase of the La/Al ratio, which also explains the transition
from metallic behavior to insulating behavior of the interfaces. Our research
emphasizes the key role of the cation stoichiometry of LaAlO3 in the formation
of the conducting interface, and also the control which is furnished by the Ar
pressure in the growth process.

The discovery of a high mobility conducting interface between LaAlO3 (LAO) and
SrTiO3 (STO) has given rise to numerous investigations1. This two-dimensional electron
system (2DES) exhibits multiple intriguing physical properties, such as superconductivity2,
magnetism3–5, and gate tunable insulator to metal6 and insulator to superconductor
transitions7. However, the origin of the 2DES in still under debate. Proposed explanations
basically fall into two classes, intrinsic charge transfer and extrinsic defects mechanisms.
The intrinsic mechanism considers the polar discontinuity between the polar LAO and the
nonpolar STO, which leads to a charge transfer above a critical thickness of LAO ﬁlms8.
The extrinsic mechanisms involve defects formed at the interface during the ﬁlm deposition
process, such as oxygen vacancies in the STO substrate9–11 and cation intermixing at the
interface12,13.

Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is by far the most commonly used growth method to
prepare LAO/STO interfaces. During the PLD process,high energy particle bombardment
could introduce the above defects into the interface, which makes it diﬃcult to understand
the roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms13. Other growth techniques bring new
insights here. Warusawithana et al. 14 studied the LAO/STO system by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). The interesting outcome is that interfacial conductivity was only observed
in Al-rich samples (La/Al ≤ 0.97). Further density functional calculations demonstrated
the diﬀerent roles of defects in the charge transfer mechanism.
In Al-rich samples, Al
can ﬁll La vacancies without changing the net charge of the (001) planes. The electronic
reconstruction can still transfer electrons to the interface. In La-rich sample, however, La
can not substitute for Al, resulting in the formation of Al2O3-vacancy complexes which
prohibits the charge transfer.

Sputtering also has been used. High-pressure (1 mbar) on-axis sputtering yielded LAO
ﬁlms with a La/Al ratio of 1.1,and insulating interfaces15. 90◦ oﬀ-axis sputtering has been
shown to be capable of growing epitaxial and smooth ﬁlms with conducting interfaces16.
Sputtering is widely used in industry, which can also facilitate the device applications of
LAO/STO interfaces. In this work, we show the growth of high quality epitaxial LAO ﬁlms
by 90◦ oﬀ-axis sputtering. The La/Al ratio is tuned by varying the growth pressure. As a
consequence, we observe strong but controlled variations in the interfacial conductivity.

LAO ﬁlms were grown on TiO2-terminated STO (001) substrates.

the TiO2 termination, the substrates were etched by buﬀered HF for 30 s and annealed
at 980 ◦C in ﬂowing oxygen (150 sccm) for 1 h17.
In the sputtering system, the working

proper choice of growth pressure is strongly dependent on the working distances. A 2-inch
single crystal LAO wafer was used as the sputtering target. The growth temperature was
800 ◦C and the RF power was 50 W. Five samples were grown at various Ar pressures
from 0.04 mbar to 0.10 mbar (see Table I). In the following the samples will be referred to
with their growth pressure. The target was pre-sputtered for at least 15 min in order to
stabilize an oxygen background partial pressure produced by the target16. After deposition,
the samples were in situ annealed in 1 mbar oxygen at 600 ◦C for 1 h to remove the oxygen
vacancies in the STO substrates. The samples were then cooled down to room temperature
in the same oxygen atmosphere at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. The deposition rate decreases from
4.27 ˚A/min at 0.04 mbar to 3.20 ˚A/min at 0.10 mbar. Two reference samples were prepared
to test the eﬀectiveness of the oxygen annealing treatment. One sample is a bare STO
substrate heated up to the growth temperature without ﬁlm deposition. The other sample
is an amorphous LAO/STO sample grown at room temperature at 0.08 mbar. Both samples
were highly conductive, which indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies18,19. The samples
then underwent the above oxygen annealing treatment and were found to be insulating.

Surface topologies were measured by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
epitaxial quality of the interface was characterized by scanning transmission electron mi-
croscopy (STEM). Film thicknesses and lattice constants were determined by high-resolution
X-ray diﬀraction (HRXRD). Magnetrotransport properties were measured with a Quantum
Design physical property measurement system (PPMS) by sweeping the magnetic ﬁeld be-
tween ± 9 T. The measurements were performed in the van der Pauw geometry. Ohmic
contacts were formed by wedge bonding Al wire directly to the sample surface.

Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) show the AFM topographic images of samples 004 and 010.
An atomically ﬂat surface with clear step-and-terrace structure can be observed. The inset
shows the step height which corresponds to the STO (001) interplanar distance (≈ 3.905 ˚A).
The epitaxial quality of the ﬁlms was further characterized by high-angle annular dark
ﬁeld STEM (HAADF-STEM). As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), atomically sharp
interfaces between the ﬁlm and the substrate are clearly visible. Fig. 2(c) shows the
STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis of samples 004 and 010.
This concentration proﬁle is obtained by integration of the EELS intensity of the La-M4,5
and Ti-L2,3 edges during a spectrum image unit cell by unit cell in the growth direction.
The proﬁle is normalized by the maximum of intensity and cation vacancies are neglected.
Identical intermixing (4 unit cells) was observed for both samples. This demonstrates that
interdiﬀusion is a phenomenon that is not inﬂuenced by the growth pressure of the ﬁlm.

diﬀraction peak of samples 004 and 010. The ﬁlms are coherently strained to the substrate,
which means that in-plane lattice constant (aLAO) is 3.905 ˚A. Fig. 3(c) shows the θ-2θ scans.
The dashed lines are the positions of LAO (002) diﬀraction peaks. It can be seen that as
the growth pressure increases, the LAO peak shifts to lower angle, which corresponds to an
increase of the out-of-plane lattice constant (cLAO)20. By ﬁtting the interference fringes,
we extract cLAO as well as the ﬁlm thickness (tLAO). Table I summarizes the estimated
values for aLAO, cLAO and tLAO of the samples.
It has been reported that the increase
of cLAO is due to the increase of the La/Al ratio in LAO ﬁlms. The relationship between
them was systematically studied by Qiao et al. 20. Thus, we extract the La/Al ratios of our
samples by interpolating our data points using their published results. The interpolated
La/Al ratios are listed in Table I. As the growth pressure increases from 0.04 mbar to 0.10
mbar, the La/Al ratio increases from 0.88 to 1.00.

Fig. 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the sheet resistance (Rs) for samples
grown at various Ar pressures. Samples 004, 006 and 008 show similar metallic behav-
ior from 300 K to 3 K. The interfacial conductivity changes dramatically as the growth
pressure further increases. For sample 009, Rs decreases from 1.4 × 105 Ω/(cid:3) at 300 K to

010, Rs decreases from 3.5 × 105 Ω/(cid:3) at 300 K to 1.6 × 105 Ω/(cid:3) at 100 K and abruptly
changes to insulating state afterwards. The temperature dependence of the carrier density
(ns) and the Hall mobility (µH) for the metallic samples are shown in Fig. 4(b). ns and
µH were determined by ns = 1/eRH and µH = RH/Rs, where e and RH are the electron
charge and the Hall coeﬃcient, respectively. ns and µH are approximately 1 × 1013 cm−2
and 2.6 × 102 cm2/Vs, respectively, at 3 K, which is consistent with reported results of
LAO/STO interfaces grown by sputtering16 and PLD9,21.

Our experimental results help to gain some insight in the role of extrinsic defects induced
by the PLD process. First, as is well known, oxygen vacancies can lead to conductivity in
either bare STO substrates18 or LAO/STO interfaces19,21,22. Our samples were grown in a
reducing atmosphere, thus there is a large amount of oxygen vacancies in STO without post
oxygen annealing. The behavior of our reference samples indicates that the post oxygen
annealing treatment is eﬃcient enough to remove the oxygen vacancies in the STO substrate
created during the ﬁlm deposition.

Second, it has been reported that La-doped STO shows metallic behavior23. At the
LAO/STO interface, La/Sr intermixing could be induced in two ways. One way is simply
by the PLD process itself, during which the STO substrate is bombarded by particles
with kinetic energies around several tens of eV13. In our oﬀ-axis sputtering deposition, we
use relatively high Ar pressures (0.04-0.10 mbar), which correspond to mean free paths of

several millimeters. The direct distance between the center of the target and the substrate
is about 87.5 mm. The ejected particles would undergo multiple scatterings to slow down
their speed before they deposit on the substrate. In our case, the chance of introducing
La/Sr intermixing by high energy particle bombarding should be low. The other way is
the dipole compensation mechanism proposed by Nakagawa et al. 8, where a compensating
dipole is produced by La/Sr intermixing to reduce the interface dipole energy. We observed
identical intermixing in samples 004 and 010. However, intermixing should not be the origin
of conductivity otherwise the two samples would show similar conducting behavior. We
therefore conclude that oxygen vacancies or cation intermixing may exist at our LAO/STO
interfaces, however, their contributions to the conductivity are negligible.

In our experiments, all the LAO ﬁlms are epitaxially strained to STO substrates. In-
creasing the growth pressure only increases the La/Al ratio, which we believe is due to light
Al being scattered more easily at higher pressures15. The dramatic change in the transport
properties is related to the change of cation stoichiometry of the LAO ﬁlms. Thus our re-
sults agree with the cation stoichiometry mechanism proposed by Warusawithana et al. 14.
For the LAO/STO samples grown by PLD, it has been reported that a slight variation
in growth parameters modiﬁes the cation stoichiometry of LAO24–26, also resulting in a
dramatic change in the interfacial conductivity. However, the cation stoichiometry is not
checked on a routine basis. It might explain the fact that samples from diﬀerent PLD groups
are often hardly comparable, although similar growth parameters are used.

In conclusion, high quality epitaxial LAO ﬁlms were grown on STO (001) substrates by
90◦ oﬀ-axis sputtering. While increasing the growth pressure, little structural variations
have been observed, except for an increase of the out-of-plane lattice constant, which in-
dicates an increase of the La/Al ratio. Metallic conducting interfaces were only found in
Al-rich samples. Our results emphasize that cation stoichiometry in LAO ﬁlms plays an
important role in the formation of interfacial conductivity at the LAO/STO interfaces.
