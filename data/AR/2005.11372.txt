ABSTRACT
We present a reassessment of the radial abundance gradients of C, N, O, Ne, S, Cl and
Ar in the Milky Way using deep spectra of 33 H ii regions gathered from the literature,
covering Galactocentric distances from 6 to 17 kpc. The distances of the objects have
been revised using Gaia parallaxes. We recalculate the physical conditions and ionic
abundances in an homogeneous way using updated atomic data. All the objects have
direct determination of the electron temperature, permitting to derive their precise
ionic abundances. We analyze and compare diﬀerent ICF schemes for each element in
order to obtain the most conﬁdent total abundances. Due to the revised distances, our
results do not support previous claims about a possible ﬂattening of the O/H gradient
in the inner Galactic disk. We ﬁnd that the Galactic N/O gradient is rather ﬂat, in
contrast to what has been found in other spiral galaxies. The slope of the gradients of
some elements is sensitive to the ICF scheme used, especially in the case of Ne. The
dispersion around the ﬁt for the gradients of C, N, O, S, Cl and Ar is of the order of
the typical uncertainties in the determination of the abundances, implying the absence
of signiﬁcant inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of the ionized gas phase of
the ISM. We ﬁnd ﬂat gradients of log(S/O) and log(Cl/O) and very shallow or ﬂat
ones for log(Ne/O) and log(Ar/O), consistent with a lockstep evolution of Ne, S, Cl
and Ar with respect to O.

1 INTRODUCTION

Stellar interiors are the factories where a large fraction of
metals with Z<30 are formed in the Universe. H ii regions,
in particular Galactic regions, are excellent places to study
the chemical abundances of metals such as C, N, O, Ne, S,
Cl and Ar.

O is the third most abundant element in the Universe,
and is usually taken as a proxy of the metallicity in pho-
toionized nebulae. O is almost entirely produced by massive
stars (MS, M(cid:38)8 M(cid:12)) and later ejected to the interstellar
medium (ISM) by type II supernovae explosions in short
time scales. On the other hand, C and N present a much
more complicated origin as they can be produced by dif-
ferent mechanisms in diﬀerent stellar mass ranges (Garnett
1990; Chiappini et al. 2003; Clayton 2003; Carigi et al. 2005).

tion models to reproduce the observed behavior of negative
C/O ratio gradients in the Galaxy; in the model that bet-
ter reproduced the observations, the fraction of C produced
by massive stars and low-to-intermediate mass stars (LIMS,
M(cid:46)8 M(cid:12)) is dependent on time and on the Galactocentric
distance. This model also predicted that, at the present time
in the solar vicinity, half of the C in the ISM has been pro-
duced by MS and half by LIMS. For N, the behaviour is
even more complicated as this element can have diﬀerent
origins: the main channel of N production is as a product
of the CNO cycle, being formed at the expense of C and
O already present in the star (secondary origin). However,
it can also have a primary origin, both in asymptotic gi-
ant branch (AGB) stars through eﬃcient nuclear burning
at the base of the convective envelope (hot bottom burn-
ing) in intermediate-mass stars (3.5 M(cid:12) (cid:46) M (cid:46) 8 M(cid:12), see
Karakas & Lugaro 2016, and references therein), or in MS
through stellar rotation (Meynet & Maeder 2002). There-

fore, the study of N/O and C/O ratios can provide precious
constraints to the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

Ne, S and Ar, are produced via the alpha process in
MS and ejected to the ISM along with O in core-collapse su-
pernovae explosions. Therefore their abundance ratios with
respect to O are, in principle, expected to be constant (e.g.
Croxall et al. 2016; Esteban et al. 2020; Berg et al. 2020). A
similar behaviour is expected for Cl, which is produced by
single particle – proton or neutron – capture by a S or Ar
isotope (see Esteban et al. 2015).

Among the diﬀerent sources of uncertainty in chemi-
cal abundance determinations, ionization correction factors
(ICFs) play a critical role for most of the elements observed
in the spectra of photoionized regions (e. g. Peimbert et al.
2017; Delgado-Inglada et al. 2019). ICFs take into account
the contribution of unseen ions, and can be calculated both
by using ionization potential similarities between observed
and unseen ions (Peimbert & Costero 1969; Peimbert &
Torres-Peimbert 1977) or making photoionization models
grids of complete extragalactic H ii regions, which in prin-
ciple should be more reliable as they include the physics
that drives the spatial distribution of ions in photoionized
nebulae. Some remarkable examples of this last approach
can be found in Stasi´nska (1978); Izotov et al. (2006); Dors
et al. (2016) and Berg et al. (2020). Finally, our group has
also made an empirical approach for speciﬁc elements in our
Galaxy, such as Cl and N, based on observations of Galactic
H ii regions that do not need ICF correction (Esteban et al.
2015; Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas 2018).

The local metallicity, parameterized by the O/H ratio,
is directly related to the star formation rate that, in spi-
ral galaxies, is correlated with the total surface density (e.g.
Vila-Costas & Edmunds 1992; Henry & Worthey 1999; Ca-
rigi et al. 2019). Moreover, the absolute value of the O/H
ratio at a given point of the disc of a spiral galaxy may be
an indicator of the upper mass limit of the initial mass func-
tion of the whole galaxy Carigi et al. (2019). Since the earlier
works by Guesten & Mezger (1982), Lacey & Fall (1985) or
Goetz & Koeppen (1992), most chemical evolution models
in the literature (see Moll´a 2014, and references therein) ex-
plain the existence of radial abundance gradients in the discs
of spiral galaxies by the combined eﬀect of radial variations
of the star formation rate and the gas infall. As Henry et al.
(2010) discuss, the density threshold of star formation (e.g.
Marcon-Uchida et al. 2010) and the timescale for disc for-
mation (e.g. Fu et al. 2009) can regulate the shape of the
abundance gradient, in the sense that radial changes of any
of both quantities can vary the slope of the radial O/H gra-
dients. Therefore, a better determination of the shape of the
gradients and the absolute value of the chemical abundances
at a given Galactocentric radius will help to constrain essen-
tial basic parameters of chemical evolution models.

The studies of radial abundance gradients in the Milky
Way from H ii regions data have focused mainly on O and N.
Since the canonical work by Shaver et al. (1983), the Galac-
tic radial O abundance gradient has been extensively studied
in the last two decades (e. g. Deharveng et al. 2000; Esteban
et al. 2005; Quireza et al. 2006; Rudolph et al. 2006; Balser
et al. 2011; Esteban et al. 2013, 2017; Fern´andez-Mart´ın
et al. 2017). Most of these studies have remarkably con-
sistent slopes of the O gradient (between −0.040 dex kpc−1
and −0.060 dex kpc−1), even taking into account the dif-

ferent methodologies and wavelength coverage of the data.
The most recent value reported in the literature for the ra-
dial O abundance gradient in our Galaxy is the one reported
by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018), who computed a slope
of −0.042 dex kpc−1. Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) also
studied the radial gradient of N/H using a sample of very
low-ionization H ii regions, allowing them to avoid the use
of an ICF for most of their sample. These authors compared
also diﬀerent ICF schemes for N and presented values of the
slopes for N/H and N/O ratios in comparison with objects
without an ICF scheme. They did not ﬁnd large diﬀerences
or trends between the objects using an ICF scheme and those
ones without using it, and reported a radial N gradient with
a slope of −0.047 dex kpc−1 and an almost ﬂat, within the
uncertainties, N/O gradient, in agreement with what found
by Shaver et al. (1983). However, other authors have found
an enhancement of the N/O ratio in the inner part of the
Galactic disc although without strong evidence for an overall
linear radial gradient of this quantity (Simpson et al. 1995;
Rudolph et al. 2006). Given the uncertainty of the ICF, the
diverse methodologies used in the literature to compute the
N abundances, and the diﬀerent wavelength and Galacto-
centric distance ranges covered, it is diﬃcult to arise to ﬁrm
conclusions on the behaviour of the N/O ratio in our Galaxy.
Regarding C in the Milky Way, Esteban et al. (2005)
and Esteban et al. (2013) computed the radial C/H and C/O
gradients from recombination lines and obtained negative
slopes for both ratios, which were consistent with C yields
that increase with metallicity owing to stellar winds in MS
and decrease with metallicity owing to stellar winds in LIMS
(Carigi et al. 2005).

Radial gradients of α-elements (Ne, S and Ar; we also
include Cl in this group as argued before) from H ii region
data are relatively scarce in the literature although some
studies have reported radial gradients for one or several α-
elements using either optical or IR spectra (e. g. Shaver et al.
1983; Mart´ın-Hern´andez et al. 2002; Esteban et al. 2015;
Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al. 2017). In general, the results ob-
tained by all these authors for Ne, S and Ar are consistent
with ﬂat radial α/O gradients; however the dispersion at a
given Galactocentric distance is generally large, which can
be attributed to uncertainties in the assumed ICF schemes
or to the methodologies adopted for physical conditions and
chemical abundance computations (i. e. obtained from obser-
vations using diﬀerent wavelength ranges that do not cover
the same volume of the nebula). However, from deep, high-
resolution spectra, these dispersion can be signiﬁcantly re-
duced. Esteban et al. (2015), using published data for a sam-
ple of nine H ii regions, reported for the ﬁrst time the radial
gradients for Cl/H and Cl/O ratios without using any ICF
scheme for Cl. These authors found a slope of −0.043 dex
kpc−1 for the Cl/H radial gradient, in agreement with what
found from planetary nebulae (PNe) (Henry et al. 2004). On
the other hand, Esteban et al. (2015) reported a ﬂat slope
value of −0.001 dex kpc−1 for Cl/O, indicating a lockstep
evolution of both elements.

The relatively large amount of deep, high-quality spec-
tra of Galactic H ii regions collected by our group in the
last years by using modern high-sensitivity spectrographs
attached to large (8-10m) ground-based telescopes and cov-
ering a wide range of Galactocentric distances (e. g. Esteban
et al. 2004; Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007; Es-

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

teban et al. 2013, 2017; Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas 2018) have
allowed us to develop detailed analysis of the physical condi-
tions and chemical abundance patterns of diﬀerent elements
using both collisional excitation lines (CELs) and, in several
cases, recombination lines (RLs, used to compute C/H and
C/O ratios, see Esteban et al. 2005, 2013). In these studies,
we have signiﬁcantly reduced the scatter previously found in
abundance gradients of O, C and N at a given Galactocentric
distance by minimizing the observational uncertainties (Ro-
dr´ıguez 2017; Garc´ıa-Rojas 2020b). Special eﬀorts have been
devoted in the last years in the detection of the temperature-
sensitive auroral lines such as [N ii] λ5755 and/or [O iii]
λ4363 in objects in the inner and outer Galactic disc (Es-
teban et al. 2017; Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al. 2017; Esteban &
Garc´ıa-Rojas 2018); this is a challenge owing to a one or a
combination of several factors: the intrinsic faintness of the
object, the relatively low ionization degree of the gas, the
high extinction by dust and, in the case of the inner objects,
their relatively high metallicity.

In this work, we have collected a large sample of high-
quality medium-to-high resolution optical spectra of Galac-
tic H ii regions and present a re-analysis of the elemental
abundances of C, N, O, Ne, S, Cl and Ar by using diﬀerent
ICF schemes proposed for H ii regions, and studying eﬀects
of the temperature structure in the nebula with the aim of
improving the computation of radial abundance gradients of
these elements that can be used to better constrain chem-
ical evolution models of the Milky Way. The structure of
this paper is as follows. In § 2 we describe the sample of
spectra that were collected from the literature and present a
reassessment of the distances of the objects using Gaia par-
allaxes of the second data release (DR2) (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018). In § 3, we present the values of physical con-
ditions, electron density and temperature and computations
of ionic abundances. In § 4 we discuss the results obtained
by using diﬀerent ICF schemes for our sample. In § 5 we
present the radial abundance gradients of the diﬀerent ele-
ments and a comparison with results for other objects and
galaxies. Finally, in § 6 we summarize our main conclusions.

2 SAMPLE

The sample comprises 33 Galactic H ii regions with high or
intermediate-resolution spectra from Esteban et al. (2004,
2013, 2017); Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018); Garc´ıa-Rojas
et al. (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2014) and Fern´andez-Mart´ın
et al. (2017). These are, to our knowledge, the highest signal-
to-noise ratio spectra for each individual H ii region of our
sample. This is the meaning we give to the term ”deep” spec-
trum in the present paper. In Table 1, we list the objects of
our sample and the references of their original spectroscop-
ical data.

Esteban et al. (2017) and Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas
(2018) give the Galactocentric distance, RG, of most of the
sample objects (all except IC 5146, Sh 2-132 and Sh 2-156).
Those authors adopted the mean values of kinematic and
stellar distances given in diﬀerent published references and
an uncertainty corresponding to their standard deviation.
M´endez-Delgado et al. (2020) have made a revision of the
distances taking into account new determinations based on
Gaia DR2 parallaxes (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). After

a detailed discussion for each nebulae and considering the
uncertainties, M´endez-Delgado et al. (2020) adopt the RG
values obtained from Gaia data for objects with heliocentric
distances smaller than 5 kpc and the values given by Este-
ban et al. (2017) and Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) for the
rest except for few particular cases. Since our sample include
more objects than the one studied by M´endez-Delgado et al.
(2020) and in the sake of homogeneity, we have applied the
same methodology to revise the distances of the objects that
are not included in M´endez-Delgado et al.

In the case of IC 5146, Sh 2-61, Sh 2-132, Sh 2-156, Sh 2-
175, Sh 2-219, Sh 2-235, Sh 2-237, Sh 2-257, Sh 2-271, Sh 2-
285 and Sh 2-297, which are located at heliocentric distances
smaller than 5 kpc, we have adopted the distance based on
parallaxes from Gaia DR2 data taken from the database of
Bailer-Jones et al. (2018). For Sh 2-90 and Sh 2-266, with
heliocentric distances about or larger than 5 kpc, we as-
sumed the distances quoted by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas
(2018), which have lower uncertainties and are based on sev-
eral diﬀerent but consistent kinematical and photometrical
distances. We describe the details for each object below.

IC 5146. Avedisova & Kondratenko (1984) found that
this nebulae is ionized by the star BD+46 3474, the brightest
star of the region. We use the RG obtained from its Gaia
DR2 parallax, which is consistent with the photometrical
distances determined by Herbig & Dahm (2002) and Harvey
et al. (2008)

Sh 2-61. Hunter & Massey (1990) report 4 stars as the
ionizing sources of the nebula. We determine the mean dis-
tance corresponding to the Gaia DR2 parallaxes of those 4
sources, which is marginally consistent with to the one given
by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) – RG = 5.7± 0.3 kpc –
within the errors.

Sh 2-90. Samal et al. (2014) identiﬁed 4 stars as the most
probable ionizing sources of this H ii region. Two of the stars
give anomalously large parallaxes probably because they are
very close to a ﬁeld star. The other two stars give distances
with very large uncertainties but in complete agreement with
the one given by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018). We adopt
the RG given by these last authors for the object.

Sh 2-132. We have obtained the Gaia DR2 parallaxes
for 11 stars that Harten et al. (1978) consider associated
with the H ii region. The RG assumed for this object is the
weighted average of the individual distances of that group
of stars.

Sh 2-156. We have determined and adopted the RG of
the nebula from the Gaia DR2 parallax for the O7 star that
Lynds & Oneil (1983) consider the ionizing source of the
nebula. The rest of stars located inside a circle of 10 arcsec
radius around the star show very similar parallaxes.

Sh 2-175. This nebula is ionized by a single star,
LS I +64 26. We use the distance obtained from its Gaia
DR2 parallax.

Sh 2-219. The ionization source of this H ii region is the
star LS V +47 24. Its Gaia DR2 parallax give a RG in agree-
ment with that reported by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018).
Sh 2-235. Camargo et al. (2011) found that the star
BD+35 1201 is its main ionizing source. We have assumed
the distance derived from the Gaia DR2 parallax for that
star.

Sh 2-237. We analyzed the Gaia DR2 data of 10 of the
stars identiﬁed by Pandey et al. (2013) as members of the

tent distances, which are very similar and more precise than
the distance reported by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018).
We adopted the mean distance obtained from the parallaxes
of the stars associated to the nebula.

Sh 2-257. Ojha et al. (2011) proposed that HD 253327 is
the ionizing star of the nebula, but its associated Gaia DR2
source indicates that its heliocentric distance is a factor of
ten lower than in several previous studies. However, Ojha
et al. (2011) and other authors agree on that Sh 2-257 be-
longs to the same molecular complex as Sh 2-254, Sh 2-255,
Sh 2-256 and Sh 2-258 and all of them should be located
at the same distance. We have adopted the distance deter-
mined from the Gaia parallax of LS 19, the ionizing star
of Sh 2-255, the one with the best data, as representative
of Sh 2-257. This is in complete agreement with the mean
value of photometrical and kinematical RG determinations
given in Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) for this object.

kpc derived from that parallax is consistent with that given
by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018), based on the kinemat-
ical data of Russeil et al. (2007) and photometrical mea-
surements by Mehner et al. (2016). We assume the distance
given by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) as representative
of Sh 2-266.

Sh 2-270. The Gaia DR2 parallax of the ionizing star
of this nebula identiﬁed by Neckel & Staude (1984) is very
uncertain, giving a RG = 11.9+2.5
kpc. The spectrophoto-

metrical determination obtained by Foster & Brunt (2015)
and the kinematical one by Russeil et al. (2007) give con-
siderably larger distances. We adopted the mean of these
last values, which is the one assumed by Esteban & Garc´ıa-
Rojas (2018) for this object. The larger value of the distance
makes the O/H ratio of Sh 2-270 more consistent with the
expected according to the radial abundance gradient.

3 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND IONIC

ABUNDANCES

3.1 Electron temperature and density

We have used the Python package PyNeb version 1.1.5
(Luridiana et al. 2015) to determine the physical conditions
and chemical abundances in a homogeneous way using the
line intensities compiled from the literature. To minimize the
eﬀects of atomic data on the computation of nebular abun-
dances (Juan de Dios & Rodr´ıguez 2017) we have carefully
selected the atomic data set used in this work, which is listed
in Table 2. The electron density, ne, was calculated using the
[O ii] λ3729/λ3726 and/or [S ii] λ6717/λ6731 line intensity ra-
tios. For objects where it was possible to measure both den-
sities we used their mean value in our calculations. In most
of the nebulae we obtain low densities, ne < 100 cm−3, we as-
sumed ne = 100 cm−3 for them (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
We have used a two-zone scheme characterized by Te([N ii])
and Te([O iii]) derived from the [N ii] (λ6548 + λ6584)/λ5755
and [O iii] (λ4959 + λ5007)/λ4363 line intensity ratios, re-
spectively. The intensity of [N ii] λ5755 may have a possible
contribution from the recombination of N2+ (Rubin 1986;
Stasi´nska 2005; Liu et al. 2000). We have not considered
such contribution owing that it has been proven to be small
in the H ii regions in our sample (see for example, Garc´ıa-
Rojas et al. 2006; Esteban et al. 2017; Esteban & Garc´ıa-
Rojas 2018), and because this correction is rather uncertain.
We have used the temperature relation proposed by Es-
teban et al. (2009, their equation 3) to estimate Te([O iii])
from Te([N ii]) when the auroral λ4363 line is not detected.
For IC 5146, we have done the calculations separately for
the spectra of apertures 2, 3 and 4 observed by Garc´ıa-
Rojas et al. (2014). These authors consider such apertures
as representative of the main volume of the nebula. Our ﬁ-
nal values for the physical conditions and ionic abundances
of IC 5146 are the weighted average ones obtained for those
apertures. The ﬁnal results for ne([O ii]), ne([S ii]), Te([N ii])
and Te([O iii]) for each nebulae are included in Table 1.

3.2 Ionic abundances

For our calculations, we have adopted Te([N ii]) as repre-
sentative of the N+, O+, S+ and Cl+ emitting regions and
Te([O iii]) for the C2+, O2+, Ne2+, Cl3+ and Ar3+ ones. Fol-
lowing the recommendation of Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al.
(2019), we also adopted Te([N ii]) to calculate the Cl2+ abun-
dance and the mean value of Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]) to cal-
culate S2+ and Ar2+ abundances.

We calculated C2+/H+ abundances using the intensity
of the pure recombination C ii λ4267 line for a sample of
11 H ii regions. We used the eﬀective recombination coeﬃ-
cients of Davey et al. (2000) for C ii and Storey & Hum-
mer (1995) for H i and Te([O iii]) as representative of the
C2+ zone. The ionic abundance of N+ were calculated using
λλ6548, 6584 for the total sample. For oxygen, we calculate
the ionic abundances of O+, O2+ using the line intensities
of [O ii] λλ3726, 3729 and [O iii] λλ4959, 5007, respectively,
for all the objects of our sample. For Sh 2-209, we used the
line intensities of [O ii] λλ7320,7330 to calculate O+ abun-
dance since the λλ3726, 3729 lines could not be measured in
the spectrum due to the faintness and high extinction coeﬃ-
cient of this nebula. In Table 3 we include the values of C2+,

star, which lies in the centre of the nebula. We adopt the
distance based on Gaia DR2 data for that star (source
3331937432404833792) as representative of the object.

Sh 2-285. Moﬀat et al. (1979) and Rolleston et al. (1994)
identiﬁed the two ionizing stars of this H ii region. The dis-
tances of both stars determined from their Gaia DR2 paral-
laxes are similar but with very diﬀerent degree of accuracy.
We adopt the distance of the star with the lowest uncer-
tainty.

Sh 2-297. Mallick et al. (2012) identiﬁed the ionizing
star of the H ii region. We have adopted the distance derived
from the Gaia DR2 parallax of that star for the nebula.

In Table 1, we include the ﬁnal adopted RG for our
sample of Galactic H ii region. The objects cover a rather
wide range of RG from 6.15 to 17.0 kpc. Our revision of dis-
tances considering Gaia DR2 parallaxes provides a slightly
narrower range of RG in comparison with that obtained by
Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018), that was from 5.1 to 17 kpc.
It is important to note that the revision of the distances af-
fect especially to those objects located nearer the Galactic
Centre. In fact, all the nebulae with RG smaller than 8 kpc
show now larger values of RG. This is an interesting system-
atic eﬀect that merits to be further investigated but, un-
fortunately, is out of the scope of the present paper. Fig. 1
shows the spatial distribution of the 33 H ii regions onto the
Galactic plane.

N+, O+ and O2+ abundances and the degree of ionization
measured as O2+/(O+ + O2+) = O2+ for each object.

The Ne2+ abundances were calculated for 15 regions
with measurements of [Ne iii] λλ3869, 3967 lines. For Sh 2-
83, Sh 2-100, Sh 2-128, Sh 2-156 and Sh 2-212, we only used
the line intensity of [Ne iii] λ3869 to calculate the Ne2+/H+
ratio, since the [Ne iii] λ3967 line is blended with H7 in the
spectra of these objects.

The S+ and S2+ abundances were calculated for 33
and 23 Galactic H ii regions, respectively. We used the [S ii]
λλ6717, 6731 lines to calculate S+/H+. For S2+/H+, we used
the [S iii] λ6312 line as well as [S iii] λλ9069, 9532 lines in
the spectra where the wavelength coverage was wide enough
to include them. However, the [S iii] λ9069, 9532 lines can
be aﬀected by strong telluric emission and absorption fea-
tures (Stevenson 1994; Noll et al. 2012). We discarded to

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

use these lines in the targets where they are reported as
aﬀected by telluric emission/absorption in the original ref-
erence. For the remaining objects, we inspected whether the
observed intensity ratio I([S iii] λ9532)/I([S iii] λ9069) devi-
ated ±20% from the theoretical value of 2.47 (as computed
using the atomic data adopted in this work); we discarded
the [S iii] λ9069 line when the ratio was larger than the theo-
retical one and we discarded [S iii] λ9531 line when the ratio
was lower. Following these criteria, we have used the [S iii]
λ9069 line to estimate the S2+/H+ ratio in IC 5146, M8, Sh 2-
132, Sh 2-156 and NGC 3576, and [S iii] λ9532 in the cases
of NGC 3603 and Sh 2-298. We used both [S iii] red lines for
the rest of the regions for which we measure those lines. The
[S iii] λ6312 line, which is very sensitive to the electron tem-
perature and much fainter than the [S iii] λλ9069, 9532 lines,
was only considered when it was the only [S iii] line available
in the spectra.

We have calculated the Cl2+ abundances for 25 Galactic
H ii regions by using the intensities of [Cl iii] λλ5518, 5538
lines. For nine of those objects, it was also possible to derive
the Cl3+ and/or Cl+ abundances using the faint [Cl iv] λ8046
and/or [Cl ii] λ9139 lines, respectively (see Esteban et al.
2015).

We calculated the Ar2+ abundances using the [Ar iii]
λλ7135, 7751 lines for a sample of 26 H ii regions. For 10 of
them we could also calculate the Ar3+ abundance using the
[Ar iv] λ4711 and/or [Ar iv] λ4740 lines. In Table 4, we show
our results for the abundances of the observed ionic species
of Ne, S, Cl and Ar.

The uncertainties associated with each value of ne, Te
and the ionic abundances were calculated using Monte Carlo
simulations, generating 500 random values for each line in-
tensity ratio assuming a Gaussian distribution with a sigma
equal to the associated uncertainty.

4 A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF ICF

SCHEMES AND TOTAL ABUNDANCES

We determined the total O abundance by adding the con-
tribution of O+ and O2+, O/H = O+/H+ + O2+/H+. IC
5146, Sh 2-175, Sh 2-270 and Sh 2-288 do not show measur-
able [O iii] lines due to their very low degree of ionization.
For those objects we assume that O/H ≈ O+/H+ following
Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018). For the rest of the chemical
elements, we have to use ICFs to derive their total abun-
dances. The use of reliable ICFs is essential to properly esti-
mate the contribution of unobserved ions in H ii regions and
other ionized nebulae. The total abundance of a particular
element, X, can be derived as X/H = Xi+/H+× ICF, where
Xi+/H+ is the ionic abundance calculated from the observed
emission lines. The uncertainty quoted for total abundances
include – apart from the error of the ionic abundances – the
contribution due to the uncertainties associated with the
ICFs, which is not a common procedure in most works. We
use error propagation to estimate the uncertainty associated
with the abundance determinations made with the diﬀerent
ICF schemes where the value of such uncertainty is not pro-
vided, and the analytical expressions of ADIS20 to derive
the errors implied for their ICFs.

For the total N abundance, we have used two ICF
schemes, the most common one based on the similarity of

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

The abundance gradients in the Milky Way

ionization potentials of N+ and O+, N/O (cid:39) N+/O+ (Peim-
bert & Costero 1969) and the new ICF by Amayo et al.
(2020, hereinafter ADIS20) (see § 4.2.2). For objects of very
low degree of ionization where we do not detect [O iii] lines,
we assume that N/H ≈ N+/H+ (Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas
2018).

To calculate the total abundances of C, Ne, S, Cl and
Ar, we have analysed diﬀerent published ICF schemes based
on the ionization potentials of given ions, photoionization
models or observational data (e.g. Peimbert & Costero 1969;
Izotov et al. 2006; Esteban et al. 2015). We have also used
the new set of ICFs based on photoionization models of giant
extragalactic H ii regions by ADIS20 and the ICF for Cl of
Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (in preparation) derived from an
empirical relation obtained making use of very deep spectra
of Galactic and Magellanic Clouds H ii regions.

4.1 Ionization correction factors for H ii regions in

the literature

In what follows we are going to brieﬂy describe diﬀerent ICF
schemes available in the literature, whose results applied to
our sample will be discussed in § 4.2. As we pointed out in
§ 1, in this paper we test three types of ICF schemes: based
on ionization potential similarities, empirical ICFs based on
observations of both Galactic and extragalactic H ii regions,
and ICFs based on photoionization models of integrated H ii
regions; these last sets of ICFs are, in principle, better suited
for correcting elemental abundances in extragalactic objects,
where the majority of the volume of the ionized nebula is
observed. In Galactic H ii regions, which have large angular
extensions, the spectra usually cover a small volume of the
nebula. Therefore, some of the available ICF schemes could
introduce a bias in the calculations of the total abundances
if the observed volume is not representative of the whole
ionization structure of the nebula. In our sample, we have
two diﬀerent sets of observations: i) longslit spectra cover-
ing a relatively large volume on each nebula, for which it
would seem appropriate to consider that the whole ioniza-
tion structure is being observed, and ii) echelle spectra, that
only cover a small volume of the nebula. In Fig. 2 we plot
the Cl and Ar abundances obtained by applying the ICFs by
Izotov et al. (2006) in results based on longslit spectra (open
symbols) or echelle spectra (ﬁlled symbols) of our sample of
Galactic H ii regions. Those ICFs are based on photoioniza-
tion models of extragalactic H ii regions. In the case of Cl,
in Fig. 2 we also plot nebulae for which Cl/H has been com-
puted by simply adding the observed ionic abundances (gray
symbols). In that plot, we can see that apart from a possible
metallicity dependence that can aﬀect any kind of observa-
tion (more apparent in the case of Cl/O), the behaviour of
the abundance ratios obtained from echelle or longslit spec-
tra is basically the same. A similar behaviour is also found
for the S/O ratio.

For C, Garnett et al. (1999) proposed an ICF(C2+)
scheme based on a grid of photoionization models of extra-
galactic H ii regions built by Garnett et al. (1995) to correct
for the presence of C+. Recently, Berg et al. (2019) created
analytic functions for diﬀerent metallicities of the ICF for
C based on a set of photoionization models customized to
match the properties of their sample. These functions de-
pend on the ionization parameter, that is also ﬁtted as a

function of the log([O iii] λ5007/[O ii] λ3727) ratio. Unfor-
tunately, the expressions were optimized for low-metallicity
objects (Z from 0.05 to 0.4 Z (cid:12), that corresponds to O/H
ratios between 7.5 and 8.0 in the usual logarithmic scale).
In this paper we have used their expression for Z = 0.4 Z(cid:12),
which is only slightly lower than the average metallicity of
our sample.

Peimbert & Costero (1969) proposed ICFs for N, S and
Ne based on the similarity of ionization potentials of dif-
ferent ions. These authors proposed the following ICFs for
these elements: N/O = N+/O+, Ne/O = Ne2+/O2+ and S/O
= (S+ + S2+)/O+.

Dors et al. (2013) proposed an ICF(Ne2+) based on pho-
toionization models of extragalactic H ii regions. They pro-
vided an analytical expression (their Eq. 14) to be applied
for optical data. P´erez-Montero et al. (2007) calculated ICF
schemes for Ne and Ar using a grid of photoionization mod-
els that cover diﬀerent physical properties of extragalactic
H ii regions. Both ICF schemes depend on the ionization
degree of the nebula, given as O2+/O.

Stasi´nska (1978) used photoinization models to compute
ICF(S++S2+). This ICF depends on the ionization degree, as
given by O+/O, and of an α parameter which they proposed
to have a value of 3. Dors et al. (2016) also used a grid of

photoionization models of H ii regions and propose the same
expression for the ICF(S++S2+) than Stasi´nska (1978), but
with α = 3.27 ± 0.01. They recommend the use of this ICF
for H ii regions with O+/O > 0.2, being its application less
suitable for higher ionization degrees.

Izotov et al. (2006) provided a set of ICFs based on the
grid of photoionization models by Stasi´nska & Izotov (2003)
for Ne, S, Cl and Ar among other elements. Those ICFs
depend on the metallicity and the ionization degree as given
by ω = O2+/O or υ = O+/O. They proposed 3 diﬀerent ICF
ﬁts for each element depending on the metallicity: low (12 +
log O/H ≤ 7.2), high (12 + log O/H ≥ 8.2) and intermediate
metallicity (7.2 < 12 + log O/H < 8.2) that in practice should
be considered for linear interpolation with low-metallicity
ﬁts when 7.2 < 12 + log O/H < 7.6, and with high-metallicity
ﬁts when 7.6 < 12 + log O/H < 8.2. Regarding the ICF
schemes we are interested in, the ICF(Ne2+) is valid for the
whole ω and υ ranges, while ICF(Cl2+), ICF(S+ + S2+),
ICF(Ar2+) and ICF(Ar2+ + Ar3+) are restricted for values
of υ ≤ 0.8.

For Cl, Esteban et al. (2015) proposed an empirical ICF
based on observational data of Galactic H ii regions. This
ICF is valid only for the range covered by that sample, 1 <

ionizing continua typical of extremely low-ionization objects
are not normally taken into account in these grids, as the
stellar cluster ionizing these regions can never reach the ex-
tremely soft ionizing radiation ﬁeld provided by the early-
type B stars or late-type O stars ionizing some of the ob-
jects in our sample. In fact, a large fraction of our sample
(∼27% objects) show ionization degrees O2+/(O++O2+) ≤
0.1. Therefore, we expect some limitations of the ICFs based
on photoionization models when trying to reproduce the
properties of these very low ionization nebulae. In the follow-
ing section, we present a detailed analysis of the suitability
of the diﬀerent ICF schemes described above in the deter-
mination of the total abundances of our sample of Galactic
H ii regions. We have studied the behaviour of the abun-
dance ratios of C/O, N/O, Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O as a
function of O/H using the available ICF schemes to decide
which is the most appropriate for each element. As we have
taken into account the validity ranges provided for each ICF,
the number of objects studied can diﬀer within the diﬀerent
combinations of element/ICF. One of the criteria used to
analyze the suitability of the diﬀerent ICFs is the compar-
ison of the average abundance ratios of the elements with
respect to O obtained for the nebulae with the solar value.
However, it must be reminded that to make such compari-
son appropriately, the nebular ratios should be corrected for
the fraction of atoms of the given element embedded in dust
grains.

Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009) estimated that the fraction
of O embedded in dust grains in the Orion Nebula should
be about 0.12 dex. Peimbert & Peimbert (2010) proposed
that, in H ii regions, the depletion of O increases with in-
creasing O/H, from about 0.08 dex in the metal poorest ob-
jects, to about 0.12 dex in metal-rich ones. We consider that
0.10 dex is a good representative value for our sample. C is
also expected to be depleted in dust, especially in polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and graphite. The C abundance in
the gas and dust phases of the diﬀuse interstellar medium
is something very poorly understood (e.g. Soﬁa et al. 2011;
Jenkins 2014). However, Esteban et al. (1998) estimated a
dust depletion factor for C of ∼0.10 dex in the Orion Neb-
ula, similar to that of O. In their study of C abundances in
low metallicity star-forming regions, Esteban et al. (2014)
conclude that nebular C/O ratios can be directly compared
with solar or stellar abundances without correction.

Gail & Sedlmayr (1986) and Jenkins (2014) indicate
that N is not expected to be a major constituent of dust
grains, due to its inclusion in the highly stable gas form of
N2. Therefore, nebular N/O ratios should only be corrected
for dust depletion in O. Following Esteban et al. (2014), we
recommend to subtract ∼0.1 dex to the log(N/O) values ob-
tained for H ii regions when comparing with the solar ratio.
The cases of Ne and Ar pose no problem at all, because they
are noble gases and they are no part of molecules in the in-
terstellar gas. As in the case of the N/O ratio, we should
subtract 0.1 dex to the measured Ne/O and Ar/O ratios in
H ii regions to compare with the solar ratios. Finally, in the
cases of S and Cl the situation is more complicated. Custom-
arily, S has been considered not to be depleted in dust grains
(e.g. Soﬁa et al. 1994) but some authors have questioned this
assumption (e.g. Jenkins 2009). The Cl abundance is diﬃcult
to calculate in diﬀuse and dense interstellar clouds and its
observed trend is rather irregular (Jenkins 2009). Therefore,

O/H for a sample of Galactic H ii regions. The empty symbols
show regions observed with longslit spectra and ﬁlled symbols
regions observed with echelle spectra. The gray symbols in panel
(a) shows regions where Cl abundance has been computed without
using an ICF; they are connected with a solid line with points
corresponding to Cl abundance computed using an ICF for the
same region. The Cl/O and Ar/O total abundances are calculated
using the ICF scheme by Izotov et al. (2006).

O/O2+ < 7. The uncertainty associate to the ICF(Cl2+/H+)
is 0.03 dex.

ADIS20 have used a grid of photoionization models
available in the Mexican Million Models database (3MdB
Morisset 2009) under the “BOND” reference (Vale Asari
et al. 2016) to propose a new set of ICFs for C, N, Ne, S, Cl
and Ar. Their ﬁnal grid was selected by applying several ﬁl-
ters to resemble the properties of a large observational sam-
ple of extragalactic H ii regions. Such ICF schemes depend
on the ionization degree given by ω = O2+/O. They also
provide parametric formulas to calculate the uncertainty as-
sociated to the ICF of each element. These ICFs are, in
principle, valid for all ionization degrees but, as it is com-
mented below, results obtained from this ICF scheme for
objects with ω (cid:46) 0.1 should be taken with caution.

Finally, we analyze the empirical ICF of Dom´ınguez-
Guzm´an et al. (in preparation) for Cl based on deep ob-
servations of H ii regions of the Milky Way and Magellanic
Clouds. This ICF(Cl2+/O+) also depends of the ionization
degree given by log([O iii] λ5007/[O ii] λ3727). This ICF is
valid for the whole range of ionization degree of our sample.
ICFs derived from photoionization model grids are
aimed to cover a wide range of the parameter space of prop-
erties of extragalactic H ii regions; unfortunately, very soft

the fraction of S and Cl depleted in dust grains in the ISM
and in H ii regions in particular is actually unknown. Taking
into account this, and being conservative, we will consider
an additional uncertainty of 0.1 dex when comparing the
nebular and solar S/O and Cl/O ratios.

4.2 Selecting a set of ICF schemes for Galactic

H ii regions

We have carried out a detailed analysis of diﬀerent ICFs for
C, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar to select the most appropriate one
to calculate the total abundances for our sample of Galactic
H ii regions. In principle, as O, Ne, S and Ar are α-elements,
the behaviour of Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O ratios versus O/H is
expected to be ﬂat. A similar behaviour is expected for Cl
because it is produced by single-particle capture by a isotope
of S or Ar (see Esteban et al. 2015). We have computed the
average abundance ratio and its dispersion implied by the
diﬀerent ICFs for our sample of Galactic H ii regions ana-
lyzing the possible dependencies with the ionization degree
and the temperature structure (Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al.
2019). For C and N, we also use the C/O, N/O versus O/H
relation to analyze the dispersion implied for the most used
ICFs of these elements and the new ICFs by Berg et al.
(2019) and ADIS20. Finally, we compare our results with
the recommended solar values of Lodders (2019) based on
photospheric computations (C, N and O), meteoric results
(S and Cl) or a combination of solar wind determinations
and other considerations (Ne and Ar). We adopt the so-
lar 12+log(O/H) of 8.73±0.04 as recommended by Lodders
(2019).

In Table. 5, we include a summary of the diﬀerent refer-
ences for the ICFs analyzed here as well as the average value
and standard deviation computed for C/O, N/O, Ne/O,
S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O ratios in each case. Bold numbers in-
dicate the ﬁnal adopted value of each abundance ratio. In
the last row of Table. 5 we include the solar values for the
diﬀerent abundance ratios compiled by Lodders (2019) for
comparison.

4.2.1 Carbon

The total C abundances of the objects have been calculated
from the C2+/H+ ratio determined using the C ii λ4267 re-
combination line (hereafter RL) and applying an ICF. Ionic
abundances derived from RLs have the advantage of being
almost independent of Te (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006; Pe-
imbert et al. 2017), however they are always larger than the
ionic abundances derived from CELs of the same ion. This
is the well known abundance discrepancy problem and its
origin is still under debate (e.g. Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2007;
Esteban et al. 2018). Only two of our sample objects have
determinations of their C2+ abundances obtained from UV
CELs, the Orion Nebula (Walter et al. 1992) and M8 (Peim-
bert et al. 1993). The small diﬀerence between the RG values
of these objects and the large uncertainty related to the C/H
ratio of M8 (due to its rather low ionization degree), make it
unnecessary to perform any analysis based on C abundances
determined from CELs.

For all of the nebulae having C2+/H+ ratios – except
Sh 2-152 – we have also determined the O2+ abundance ob-
tained from O ii RLs. We have compiled the O2+/H+ and

Figure 3. The C/O abundance ratio as a function of O/H for
a sample of 11 Galactic H ii regions. The diﬀerent symbols show
our calculations using the ICFs of Garnett et al. 1999 (G99, black
dots), Berg et al. (2019) (B19, purple diamonds) and ADIS20
(green triangles). The dashed line and the gray band shows the
average value and the dispersion of log(C/O) implied by the ICF
of Berg et al. (2019). The empty symbols identiﬁes Sh 2-152, for
which O2+ could not be measured from RLs, (see Sec. 3.2).

O/H ratios calculated using RLs from Esteban et al. (2005),
Esteban et al. (2013) and Esteban et al. (2017) and the phys-
ical conditions calculated in § 3.2. In the case of Sh 2-152,
we have estimated its corresponding O/H(RLs) assuming the
average value of the diﬀerence O/H(RLs) − O/H(CELs) = 0.19
± 0.05 dex determined for the rest of the objects. Once we
have the O/H ratio of the nebulae determined from RLs, we
can calculate their C/O ratio free of the eﬀect of the abun-
dance discrepancy. Following the procedure outlined before,
we calculate C abundances for 11 H ii regions of our sample.
We analyze the dispersion implied by the ICFs of Garnett
et al. (1999), Berg et al. (2019) and ADIS20, using the C/O
versus O/H relation calculated using RLs for deriving C and
O abundances. We have used the O2+ and O+ abundances
determined from CELs to calculate the ionization degree ow-
ing to the dependence of the ICFs on this parameter. Table 3
also includes the O2+ ionic abundances determined from RLs
that have been used to derive C/O.

Fig. 3 shows the C/O abundance ratio as a function
of O/H for the sample of 11 Galactic H ii regions with C
and O RL measurements for the diﬀerent ICF schemes ana-
lyzed here; results using the scheme by Garnett et al. (1999)
are shown as black dots, those by Berg et al. (2019) are
plotted as purple diamonds and those computed using the
scheme by ADIS20 as green triangles. Sh 2-152 is identiﬁed in
Fig. 3 with empty symbols because, as commented before,
the value of O/H (RLs) has been estimated indirectly be-
cause no O ii RLs are detected in this object. In general the
diﬀerent ICF schemes provide similar dispersion of 0.12-0.14
dex in the C/O versus O/H relation. ICF schemes of Berg
et al. (2019) and ADIS20 provide very similar average values

(see Table 5). However, the ICF of Garnett et al. (1999) al-
though shows a dispersion similar to the other schemes, gives
a substantially larger average log(C/O) of −1.00 ± 0.13. We
should also note that M8, M16, and M20 show much larger
values of C/O using the ICF by Garnett et al. (1999) than
using the other schemes. Additionally, all the ICF schemes
provide a high (C/O (cid:38) 1) ratio for M17 (see Table 3).

In previous works, Esteban et al. (2005) and Esteban
et al. (2013) reported C abundances for eight H ii regions
from this sample using the ICF scheme of Garnett et al.
(1999). Our estimates of the C/O ratio for M16 and M20
are higher by 0.11 dex, respectively than those reported by
Esteban et al. (2005) using the same ICF, while the rest of
the sample show diﬀerences lower than 0.06 dex (see also
Esteban et al. 2013). On the other hand, the ICFs of Berg
et al. (2019) and ADIS20 show results that are very consis-
tent between them, providing small abundance diﬀerences
for C/H and C/O ratios for this sample. A similar result
was recently reported by Esteban et al. (2020) using H ii
regions of the nearby spiral galaxies M101 and M31.

We have adopted the C/H and C/O ratios obtained
using the ICF scheme of Berg et al. (2019) for our sample
objects, and these are the values included in Tables 6 and 7,
respectively. This scheme gives values very similar to the one
proposed by ADIS20, although slightly higher dispersions.
We decided not to adopt the values obtained with the ICF
scheme by ADIS20 because it is still not published at the
moment of the writing of this paper and an interested reader
could not reproduce our results. We report an average value
of log(C/O) = −0.27±0.14 (dashed line in panel (a) of Fig. 3)
for this sample. Such value is in excellent agreement with the
solar value reported by Lodders (2019) of −0.26 ± 0.09. As it
has been discussed in § 4.1, no correction for dust depletion
is needed to compare the nebular and solar C/O ratios.

H ii regions. For 12 of them, we calculate N/H and N/O

without using an ICF, as the faintness or even absence of
nebular [O iii] lines in their spectra makes the expected con-
tribution of the N2+/H+ ratio smaller than the uncertainty
of the N+ abundance (Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas 2018). In
columns 8 and 11 of Table 3, we show the N/H and N/O
ratios computed without using an ICF. For the rest of the
sample, we consider two ICF schemes, the ﬁrst is the most
common one that assumes the relation N/O = N+/O+ (Pe-
imbert & Costero 1969). We also use the new ICF(N+/O+)
proposed by ADIS20 for comparison. In columns 6, 7, 9 and
10 of Table 3 we show the results for N/H and N/O ra-
tios using both ICF schemes. A particular case is that of
Sh 2-212, which shows an extremely low value of log(N/O) ≈
−1.57 ± 0.14 dex. From the ﬂuxes reported in Esteban et al.
(2017), Sh 2-212 shows [N ii] λ6583/λ6548 ∼ 4.8, which is
much higher than the theoretical value, and indicates some
problem in line measurements, probably in [N ii] λ6548 line;
however the extremely low N/O ratio remains whatever com-
bination of [N ii] lines used to compute Te and N+/H+ ratio.
Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al. (2017) report log(N/O) = −1.16 for
this object, more consistent to the expected value. We do
not have a clear explanation for this odd result from our
spectrum of Sh 2-212, in any case, we discarded the N/O
value obtained for this region in the determination of our
average values.

In Fig. 4, we show the N/O abundance ratio as a func-
tion of O/H for our sample of Galactic H ii regions. Panels
(a) and (b) show the results for the ICFs analyzed here.
Empty stars are those regions of our sample whose N abun-
dances were calculated without using an ICF. In panel (a)
of Fig. 4, we can see that N/O ratios obtained with the
ICF scheme of Peimbert & Costero (1969) are systematically
slightly lower than those determined without an ICF. Este-
ban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) found a similar result when using
other ICFs schemes for N, as those of Izotov et al. (2006) or
Mathis & Rosa (1991). However, panel (b) of Fig. 4 shows
that the log(N/O) values obtained using the ICF of ADIS20
are more consistent with those determined without ICF. An-
other important aspect we have to remark in Fig. 4 is the
lack of any clear trend in the distribution of N/O ratios with

respect to O/H in the range of 8.00–8.60 in 12+log(O/H), as
it is usually observed in other spiral galaxies (e.g., Esteban
et al. 2020), where we see an increase of the N/O ratio at
high O/H ratios due to the secondary production of N (see
e. g. Matteucci 2014). We will discuss this issue in § 5.3.

The red dashed line in both panels of Fig. 4 shows the
average log(N/O) but only considering the data points cal-
culated using the ICF represented in each panel. We have
found average values of log(N/O) of −0.90 and −0.81 using
the ICF of Peimbert & Costero (1969) and ADIS20, respec-
tively, with a dispersion of 0.11 dex in both cases. These
values are consistent with the solar log(N/O) of −0.88 ±
0.14 recommended by Lodders (2019) within the errors. On
the other hand, the average log(N/O) for the objects whose
N abundance has been obtained without an ICF is −0.76 ±
0.09. As stated in § 4.1, we should subtract 0.1 dex from
the average nebular log(N/O) in order to compare it with
the solar value. We can see that removing 0.1 dex to the av-
erage log(N/O) values obtained for the non-ICF sample or
the ICF by ADIS20 we obtain a consistent comparison with
the solar ratio. The opposite situation is obtained with the
average log(N/O) determined with the ICF of Peimbert &
Costero (1969), since solar and nebular N/O ratios become
inconsistent.

4.2.3 Neon

For this element, we have analyzed the ICFs proposed by
Peimbert & Costero (1969), Stasi´nska (1978), Izotov et al.
(2006), P´erez-Montero et al. (2007), Dors et al. (2013) and
ADIS20. We have discarded M20 when we apply the ICF
of Stasi´nska (1978) because it is out of the range of valid-
ity of this ICF. On the other hand, we have removed the
results of Sh 2-298 and Sh 2-156 from the analysis since the

values of the Ne/O ratios for these nebulae are considerably
much higher and lower, respectively than for the rest of the
objects. The high spectral resolution of Sh 2-298 spectra re-
ported by Esteban et al. (2017) allows us to discard any
blend between the [Ne iii] λλ3869, 3967 lines and other ones,
so the quoted line intensities should be conﬁdent. The ex-
planation of the abnormally large Ne/H ratio determined for
Sh 2-298 may come from the fact that the ionizing source of
this ring nebula is a hot Wolf-Rayet star (HD56925) of the
WN4 sequence (although no overabundances have been pre-
viously reported in the nebula, see Esteban et al. 1989). The
ionizing continua coming from a WN4 star is much harder
than that considered as ionizing sources of models of normal
H ii regions. Therefore, the ionization balance for this nebula
may not be well covered by the parameter space of the pho-
toionization models used to elaborate the ICF schemes; this
should be specially important for ions with high ionization
potentials (IP), like Ne2+ with an IP=40.96 eV and ICFs
could be overestimating the contribution of lower ioniza-
tion stages as Ne+. In the case of Sh 2-156 Fern´andez-Mart´ın
et al. (observed by 2017), we have to take into account that
the nebula shows one of the lowest ionization degrees of all
the sample objects with detected [Ne iii] lines and the lowest
Ne2+/H+ ratio of the whole sample. Considering the large
and uncertain extinction coeﬃcient c(Hβ) = 1.57 ± 0.11 of
the object, and the faintness of λ3869 line (the [Ne iii] λ3967
line is not usable because of blending with H7 λ3970), it
seems likely that the intensity ratio of λ3869 line quoted by
Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al. (2017) may be inaccurate.

Fig. 5 shows the Ne/O abundance ratio as a function
of O/H for our sample of objects. For a better comparison
between the Ne/O ratios, we divided the plot in two panels,
(a) and (b), that show our calculations using the diﬀerent
ICFs for Ne using the same scale in each plot. The solid line
shows the solar Ne/O ratio (Lodders 2019) and the dashed

the mean and dispersion values of the data using the ICF of Peimbert & Costero (1969).

line in panel (a) shows the average value of Ne/O obtained
with the ICF of Peimbert & Costero (1969).

In Table 5 we show the average values and the standard
deviation obtained with each ICF in the Ne/O versus O/H
diagram. Our results show a similar scatter (between 0.15
and 0.19 dex) using the ICFs of Peimbert & Costero (1969),
Izotov et al. (2006) and ADIS20, and these results are shown
in panel (a) of Fig. 5. The average values of log(Ne/O) using
these ICFs range from −0.69 to −0.79. In Fig. 5, we note an
apparent slight dependence on metallicity in our sample im-
plied by the use of the ICFs of Peimbert & Costero (1969),
Izotov et al. (2006) and ADIS20. In principle, that depen-
dence might be due to the ionization degree since in regions
of low ionization the dispersion of Ne2+/O2+ is considerably
enhanced (Kennicutt et al. 2003; Izotov et al. 2006; P´erez-
Montero et al. 2007; Croxall et al. 2016; Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an
et al. 2019). In Panel (b) of Fig. 5, we present the results ob-
tained by using the ICFs of Stasi´nska (1978), P´erez-Montero
et al. (2007) and Dors et al. (2013), which show dispersions
between 0.27 and 0.39 dex, much larger than those obtained
with the ICFs included in panel (a). The results derived
using the ICF by Stasi´nska (1978) seem to show a strong
dependence with metallicity.

In this work, we have adopted the ICF proposed by Pe-
imbert & Costero (1969) to obtain our ﬁnal Ne/H and Ne/O
ratios because it shows a good general behaviour in the Ne/O
versus O/H relation and the smallest dispersion. Using that
ICF, we have computed the Ne abundance in 13 H ii regions
of our sample (all the objects included in Table 4 except
Sh 2-156 and Sh 2-298). The average value of log(Ne/O) =
−0.71±0.15, is marginally in agreement within the uncertain-
ties with the solar value of log(Ne/O) = −0.58 ± 0.12 given
by Lodders (2019), although this relative consistency breaks
if we consider a decrease of 0.1 dex in log(Ne/O) to account
for depletion of O onto dust grains. In any case, it should be

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

consider that solar Ne abundance is very uncertain (Lodders
2019). In fact, there is still a debate on its value owing to
the diﬃculties found in reconciling helioseismological mea-
surements with the most recent photospheric abundances of
light elements such as C, N, O, and Ne, which are needed to
properly estimate the depth of the convection zone (known
as the “solar modeling problem”, see Drake & Testa 2005;
Buldgen et al. 2019, and references therein). Measurements
of the Ne/O ratio in solar-like stars point to values much
larger than the adopted one (Drake & Testa 2005). This
would led to a much better agreement with helioseismology
measurements but also to a higher disagreement with our
adopted nebular Ne/O ratio. In Tables 6 and 7 we include
the Ne/H and Ne/O ratios implied by the ICF of Peimbert
& Costero (1969) for each object, respectively.

4.2.4 Sulfur

We have considered the ICFs by Peimbert & Costero (1969),
Stasi´nska (1978), Izotov et al. (2006), Dors et al. (2016) and
ADIS20 and the ionic abundances of S+ and S2+ given in Ta-
ble 4 to determine the S/H and S/O abundance ratios. As
the ICFs by Izotov et al. (2006) and Dors et al. (2016) are
restricted to a given validity range, the number of objects
for which we can apply with these ICFs is somewhat reduced
from the group of objects with S+ and S2+ abundances avail-
able. We have obtained an extremely low value of the S/O
ratio for Sh 2-212, independently of the ICF used, ranging
from −1.94 to −2.11. This behaviour is very similar to what
found in the N/O ratio in this region, and it is clear that the
main drivers of the low abundances are not the ICFs but the
extremely low ionic abundances obtained for N+ and S+. We
have discarded ﬂux calibration problems in the wavelength
region where [N ii] and [S ii] lines lie because the extinction
derived with Hα is in agreement with that derived from Hδ,

and the total O/H ratio derived for this object is completely
consistent with the assumed distance, which is very reliable
(see § 2). Under this considerations, Sh 2-212 is a clear out-
lier and hence, we have discarded the S/O ratio obtained for
this region in the computation of the average values.

In Fig. 6 we show the S/O ratio as a function of O/H
for our sample of Galactic H ii regions for the diﬀerent ICF
schemes considered for S. We have divided the ﬁgure in three
panels for the sake of clarity. Panel (a) of Fig. 6 shows the
results for the ICF of Izotov et al. (2006) (orange squares)
and ADIS20 (green triangles) for a sample of 14 and 16
objects, respectively. The red dashed line shows the average
value of log(S/O) using the ICF of Dors et al. (2016). Empty
stars correspond to H ii regions of very low ionization degree
(O2+/(O++O2+) ≤ 0.03: IC 5146, Sh 2-235, Sh 2-257 and
Sh 2-271) where we measure [S iii] lines. In these objects,
we expect that S3+ should be absent and we can assume:
S/H = (S+ + S2+)/H+. Therefore, an ICF is not needed for
determining their S abundance. These four objects are not
considered for the calculation of the average and dispersion
of the S/O values determined from each ICF scheme. Panel
(b) shows the S/O abundance ratios implied by the ICFs

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

of Stasi´nska (1978) (cyan pentagons) and Dors et al. (2016)
(brown down-triangles) and panel (c) shows our calculations
using the ICFs of Peimbert & Costero (1969) (blue circles).

The ICF scheme proposed by Peimbert & Costero
(1969) provides the largest dispersion (0.30 dex) in the S/O
versus O/H diagram, while the dispersions are much lower
for the other ICFs, ranging from 0.08 to 0.12 dex. The ICFs
of Stasi´nska (1978) and Dors et al. (2016) show the lowest
dispersion (0.08 dex). In Table 5 we include the average val-
ues of log(S/O) using the diﬀerent ICF schemes, which range
from −1.23 to −1.59. Using the ICFs of Stasi´nska (1978) or
Dors et al. (2016) we obtain an average value of log(S/O)
of −1.57 ± 0.08, in excellent agreement with the solar abun-
dance reported by Lodders (2019) of −1.58 ± 0.08 dex (see
Table 5).

As we have stated in § 3.2 we have adopted the average
value of Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]) to calculate the S2+ abun-
dance rather than using the most widely accepted Te([O iii]).
We checked the eﬀect of this scheme in the dispersion of S/O
abundances and found that, for example, using the ICF of
ADIS20 the dispersion slightly improves from 0.11 dex to
0.09 dex using this new temperature structure scheme. In

16 K. Z. Arellano-C´ordova et al.

the following we adopt the S/H and S/O ratios determined
using the ICF of Dors et al. (2016) as representative for the
objects. This ICF gives the average S/O ratio closer to the
solar one as well as the smallest dispersion. In Tables 6 and 7
we show the S/H and S/O ratios of 17 nebulae, respectively,
which include the objects where an ICF was not used and
for which the ICF of Dors et al. (2016) was used, excluding
Sh 2-212.

is consistent with the value obtained with the objects for
which we do not apply an ICF. In panel (b) of Fig. 7, the
red dashed line and grey band represent the average value
and the dispersion of the Cl/O ratio obtained using the ICF
by Esteban et al. (2015), respectively. In Tables 6 and 7 we
show the Cl/H and Cl/O ratios of 19 nebulae, respectively,
which include the objects where an ICF was not used and
for which the ICF of Esteban et al. (2015) was used.

4.2.5 Chlorine
We calculate the Cl2+ abundances for a sample of 25 Galac-
tic H ii regions. We also obtain Cl+ and Cl3+ for ﬁve of the
objects (M17, M42, NGC 2579, NGC 3576 and NGC 3603)
permitting to determine the Cl/H ratios simply adding their
Cl+/H+, Cl2+/H+ and Cl3+/H+ abundances. For M8, M16,
M20 and Sh 2-311, with O2+/(O++O2+) ≤ 0.26, we calculate
the Cl abundance as Cl/H = Cl+/H+ + Cl2+/H+ since the
contribution of Cl3+ is expected to be negligible (Esteban
et al. 2015). Therefore, for those two groups of nebulae, 9 in
total, we calculate the Cl abundances without using an ICF,
in the same way as Esteban et al. (2015) did. In Table 4,
we present the results for Cl+, Cl2+ and Cl3+ abundances
(columns 5, 6 and 7). For the remaining 16 Galactic H ii
regions having only Cl2+ abundance computations, we have
used four diﬀerent ICF schemes to calculate their Cl/H and
Cl/O ratios: the one proposed by Izotov et al. (2006), the
analytical ICF proposed by Esteban et al. (2015) and the
new ICFs proposed by ADIS20, and Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et
al. (in preparation). Some of those ICFs are restricted to
given validity ranges, which depend on the ionization de-
gree of the nebulae (see § 4). Those H ii regions outside the
validity ranges were discarded from the analysis.

Fig. 7 shows the Cl/O abundance ratio as a function of
O/H. Panels (a) and (b) show the results for the diﬀerent
ICFs used to calculate Cl/O. The symbols identify the ICFs
implied in this analysis. The black solid line shows the solar
value of log(Cl/O) = −3.50±0.09 by Lodders (2019). In panel
(b) the empty stars correspond to the Galactic H ii regions
for which we have not used an ICF. We do not include this
last group of nebulae for calculating the mean and dispersion
of the Cl/O ratio.

In Fig. 7 we can see that the number of objects used
with the diﬀerent ICF schemes are not the same. In partic-
ular, the ICF of Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (in preparation)
and ADIS20 are used for the whole sample where Cl2+ lines
are detected, while the validity ranges for the rest of the ICFs
limit the number of objects, ranging from 8 to 9 H ii regions.
Regarding the dispersion, the ICF of Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et
al. gives a value of 0.11 dex; the ones obtained with Izotov
et al. (2006) and Esteban et al. (2015) are between 0.08 and
0.10 dex but the ICF by ADIS20 gives a signiﬁcantly higher
dispersion of 0.44 dex, which is mainly produced by the very
low-ionization objects of our sample, for which ICFs based
on photoionization models of giant H ii regions may be in-
adequate (see § 4.1). We ﬁnd average values of log(Cl/O)
ranging from −3.09 to −3.56, all determinations except that
obtained with ADIS20 are in good agreement with the solar
value of log(Cl/O) = −3.50 ± 0.09 recommended by Lod-
ders (2019). We have selected the ICF proposed by Esteban
et al. (2015) as representative for the Cl abundances as it
provides a reasonable dispersion and its average Cl/O ratio

4.2.6 Argon
We have computed the Ar2+ abundances in 26 Galactic H ii
regions of our sample and Ar3+ abundances in 10 of them. In
Table 4, we present the Ar2+ and Ar3+ abundances for this
sample (columns 8-9). For this element, we have compared
the results obtained using three diﬀerent ICF schemes: the
ones by Izotov et al. (2006), P´erez-Montero et al. (2007)
and ADIS20. As for other elements, the validity ranges of
the ICFs have been also considered, reducing the number
of objects in some cases (see below). It is worth mentioning
that, similarly to other ions, we have used the mean value
between Te([O iii]) and Te([N ii]) as representative for Ar2+
as recommend by Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019) due to
the application of such temperature reduces the dispersion
in the Ar/O versus O/H diagram for all the ICF schemes.

Fig. 8 shows the Ar/O abundance ratio as a function
of O/H for our sample of Galactic H ii regions. Panels (a)
and (b) show the values obtained using the ICF of Izotov
et al. (2006) (orange squares), ADIS20 (green triangles) and
P´erez-Montero et al. (2007) (black down-triangles), respec-
tively. The red dashed line represents the average value of
our sample using the ICF of Izotov et al. (2006) and the
black solid line the solar value of log(Ar/O) = −2.23 ± 0.12
by (Lodders 2019). We ﬁnd a dispersion of 0.11 dex and 0.14
dex using the ICFs by Izotov et al. (2006) and ADIS20 for
15 and 26 objects, respectively. The results using the ICFs of
P´erez-Montero et al. (2007) provides the largest dispersion,
of 0.29 dex, but this is because those authors do not provide
a validity range for their ICF. The objects with log(Ar/O)
≤ −2.7 in Panel (b) of Fig. 8 depart considerably from the
rest of the sample. They are Sh 2-219, Sh 2-237, Sh 2-257,
Sh 2-271 and Sh 2-297, H ii regions with very low ionization
degree. These objects were excluded in panel (a) because
they are outside the validity ranges of the ICF by Izotov
et al. (2006). We have recomputed the dispersion implied by
the ICF of P´erez-Montero et al. (2007) discarding these low-
ionization nebulae, obtaining a signiﬁcantly lower dispersion
(0.10 dex), of the same order of the values obtained with the
other ICFs.

In Table 5 we include the average and dispersion val-
ues of Ar/O obtained with each ICF scheme used, ﬁnding
average log(Ar/O) values that range from −2.27 to −2.36,
all in good agreement with the solar value of log(Ar/O) =
−2.23 ± 0.12 reported by Lodders (2019). However, Ar is a
noble gas and we expect a log(O/H) about 0.10 dex less in
the ionized gas due to depletion onto dust grains (see § 4.1),
therefore, we should subtract that amount to the nebular
Ar/O to compare with the solar ratio. Doing so, we can see
that – as also happens with Ne/O – the agreement with the
solar Ar/O would become worse, calling into question our
assumptions for the fraction of O depleted onto dust. Our
ﬁnal adopted Ar abundances are those obtained using the

of Esteban et al. (2015). The empty stars show the Cl/O ratios of objects for which the Cl abundance has been determined without the

5 RADIAL ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS

We have performed least-squares linear ﬁts to RG – or the
fractional galactocentric distance with respect to the disc
eﬀective radius, RG/Re – of the abundances of the diﬀer-
ent elements for the sample objects collected in Tables 6
and 7. We have taken into account the uncertainties in the

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

abundances and RG using Monte Carlo simulations follow-
ing the procedure of Esteban et al. (2017) and Esteban &
Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018). Table 8 lists the parameters of the ra-
dial distributions of the abundance of each element as well
as of their abundance ratio with respect to O. For each el-
ement we give the slope and intercept of the ﬁts and the
dispersion of the individual observational data around the
ﬁt. For some elements we have included two determinations
of the gradients attending to the reasons outlined in each
case.

5.1 C, N and O abundance gradients

The most recent determination of the radial O abundance
gradient from Galactic H ii regions is by Esteban & Garc´ıa-
Rojas (2018), which is based on the same sample of objects
as the present work. As it is commented in § 2, our revi-
sion of distances considering Gaia DR2 parallaxes provides
a range of RG from 6.15 to 17 kpc for the sample, slightly dif-
ferent than the range considered by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas
(2018). In Table 8 we can see that the slope of the radial O
gradient with the new set of distances and a recalculation
of physical conditions and abundances is of −0.037 ± 0.009
dex kpc−1 consistent with the value of −0.041 ± 0.006 dex
kpc−1 obtained by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018). Fig. 9,
shows the radial distribution of the O/H ratio of the sample
objects and the corresponding radial gradient. In general,
the values of the slope of the Galactic O abundance gradi-
ent determined in other recent studies based on optical or
infrared spectra of H ii regions are fairly similar. These val-
ues are between −0.040 and −0.060 dex kpc−1 for objects
covering a wide range of Galactocentric distances (Dehar-
veng et al. 2000; Rudolph et al. 2006; Quireza et al. 2006;
Balser et al. 2011; Esteban et al. 2015; Fern´andez-Mart´ın
et al. 2017; Esteban et al. 2017). The scatter around the ﬁt
for some of those determinations are about 0.16-0.20 dex or
even higher (Rudolph et al. 2006; Quireza et al. 2006). It
was claimed that such high dispersion could be real and not
due to observational issues, implying that the gas is not well
mixed. In this work, we have calculated a dispersion around
the O abundance gradient of 0.07 dex, a value slightly larger
than the one calculated by Esteban et al. (2017) or Esteban
& Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) of 0.05 dex, but consistent with the
typical uncertainties of the O/H determinations in individ-
ual objects (see Table 3). This result strongly suggest that
O is rather well mixed in the Galactic ISM and discards the
presence of signiﬁcant azimuthal variations or gradients, at
least in the quadrant of the Milky Way covered with the op-
tical spectroscopical data used in this paper (see Fig. 1). On
the other hand, Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) reported an
apparent break of the O/H gradient for the objects located

at RG ≤ 8 kpc implied by a ﬂatter or even slightly positive
slope of the gradient in the inner Galactic disc. Chemical
evolution models by Carigi et al. (2019) reproduce that ap-
parent inner ﬂattening with an inside-out quenching of star
formation rate in the 3−5 kpc range starting about 9 Gyr
ago. However, the use of new determinations of Galacto-
centric distances at RG < 8 kpc discussed in §2 (see also
Mendez-Delgado et al. 2020) makes the possible presence
of such break in the gradient less evident. In fact, a single
data point, the comparatively lower O/H ratio of Sh 2-61 –
the H ii region of the sample with the smallest RG – is the
only one that really contribute to the visual impression of
a possible break. In this sense, more deep spectroscopic ob-
servations of H ii regions at RG < 8 kpc will provide a better
constrain of the true behavior of the O abundance gradient
in the inner part of the Galactic disc. This project is un-
derway and the results will be presented in a future paper
(Arellano-C´ordova et al., in preparation).

In Fig. 9, we have also included a quadratic ﬁt to
the 12+log(O/H) versus RG distribution, which function is
12+log(O/H) = 8.64 − 0.009 × RG − 0.0014 × R2
G. In the
ﬁgure, we can see that the quadratic ﬁt does not seem to im-
prove the functional ﬁtting of the data with respect to the
simpler linear one. This is further supported by the fact that
the dispersion of the data around the quadratic ﬁt is about
0.07 dex, the same value we obtain in the case of the linear
ﬁt. In any case, the parabolic curve gives a slightly ﬂatter
gradient in the inner zones (RG < 8 kpc) and a steeper one in
the external disc past 14 kpc. Henry et al. (2010) and Carigi
et al. (2019) also give quadratic ﬁts to the O/H gradient of
the Milky Way. The ﬁtting parameters obtained by Henry
et al. (2010), who include a large sample of data for H ii re-
gions and PNe, are fairly similar. The quadratic ﬁt obtained
by Carigi et al. (2019) for their sample of H ii region abun-
dances determined from CELs using the direct method (the
same used here, their equation 2), is similar for the external
zones, but ﬂatter in the inner Galaxy because they use the
data by Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) who, as it has been

commented before, do not use revised distances using Gaia
DR2 parallaxes.

In Fig. 9, we can see that the solar O/H ratio recom-
mended by Lodders (2019) is 0.25 dex above the line rep-
resenting the O/H gradient. This is an odd result, because
one would expect the solar photospheric O/H ratio to be
lower than the present-day one because the Sun was formed
about 4.6 Gyr ago. Chemical evolution models of the Milky
Way by Carigi et al. (2005) estimates the O/H ratio in the
solar vicinity has increased about 0.13 dex since the Sun
was formed. However, this abundance diﬀerence due to age
might be somewhat altered if Sun have migrated away from
the RG where it was formed (e.g. Wielen et al. 1996; Porte-
gies Zwart 2009). Recent dynamical evolution models of the
Milky Way (Martinez-Medina et al. 2017) predict that the
chemical eﬀect may be negligible, because the displacement
seems not signiﬁcant, 7.7 ± 1.4 kpc at 1σ for the RG cor-
responding to the solar birthplace. To make things more
tangled, the aforementioned increase in the local O/H ratio
since the formation of the Sun is not consistent with the O
abundances determined for young B-stars of the Orion OB
1 association and other zones of the solar vicinity, which are
8.76 ± 0.03 and 8.77 ± 0.05, respectively (Nieva & Sim´on-
D´ıaz 2011; Nieva & Przybilla 2012), consistent within the
errors with the solar value of 8.73 recommended by Lodders
(2019).

In agreement with Carigi et al. (2019), we think that the
oﬀset of about 0.25 dex between the nebular and solar abun-
dances may be explained by the combination of two eﬀects:
(a) the presence of some O depleted onto dust grains in the
H ii regions (in § 4.1 we stated that this might account for
0.1 dex) and (b) the eﬀect of abundance discrepancy, that
would mean that the abundances determined from CELs are
lower than true ones (see § 4.2.1), better represented by the
abundances determined from RLs. Considering the results
of several previous papers on Galactic H ii regions (Este-
ban et al. 2004, 2013; Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2004, 2005, 2007,

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

2006), we estimate that the average abundance discrepancy
for O/H is about 0.20 dex. As we can see, the eﬀects (a) and
(b) point out in the same direction, and therefore they con-
tribute to make the nebular O/H abundances about 0.3 dex
lower than true ones. Considering the discussion above, the
combination of (a), (b) and the abundance diﬀerence due
to age (although rather uncertain) can explain the observed
0.25 dex oﬀset.

Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 10 show the distributions of
the N/H and N/O ratios of the H ii regions included in Ta-
ble 3 (with the exception of Sh 2-212, see § 4.2.2) as a func-
tion of their RG, respectively. The N abundances have been
calculated using the ICF proposed by Peimbert & Costero
(1969), except for those objects where – following Esteban
& Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) and due to their very low ionization
degree – their N/H ratio was derived without using an ICF
(empty stars in Fig. 10). For the whole sample, We obtain
a slope of −0.049 ± 0.007 dex kpc−1 for the N abundance
gradient and −0.011 ± 0.006 dex kpc−1 for the N/O one (see
also Table 8). Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) determine the
N/H gradient using three diﬀerent ICFs schemes (Peimbert
& Costero 1969; Mathis & Rosa 1991; Izotov et al. 2006)
ﬁnding slopes between −0.047 and −0.050 and typical uncer-
tainties of about ±0.008, in agreement one each other and
with our results. The same agreement is also applicable for
the slope of the N/O gradient. Considering only the objects
whose N/H ratio was derived without using an ICF, our
slopes for N/H and N/O gradients are −0.057 ± 0.016 dex
kpc−1 and −0.014 ± 0.010 dex kpc−1, respectively (the pa-
rameters of this ﬁt are also included in Table 8). In Fig. 10,
we can see that the solar N/H ratio recommended by Lod-
ders (2019) is 0.19 dex above the line representing the N/H
gradient. Since no signiﬁcant dust depletion is expected for
N (see § 4.1), this might be explained by the eﬀects of the
abundance discrepancy. As we made in the case of O, con-
sidering previous published results for Galactic H ii regions
and assuming that the abundance discrepancy is produced

by temperature ﬂuctuations, the expected underestimation
of the N/H ratio should be about 0.20 dex, in quite agree-
ment with the observed oﬀset. In the case of the N/O ratio,
the oﬀset between the recommended solar value and the gra-
dient line is −0.06 dex and the depletion of O atoms onto
dust grains can successfully account for it since temperature
ﬂuctuations are not expected to appreciably aﬀect the N/O
ratio.

The slope of the N/O gradient is slightly negative and
even almost ﬂat within the uncertainties. This behaviour is
consistent with some previous determinations based on op-
tical spectra of H ii regions (Shaver et al. 1983; Esteban &
Garc´ıa-Rojas 2018) but not with others based on FIR spec-
tra. Contrary to what happens in the optical, [N iii] lines are
the only N lines observable in the FIR range and an ICF to
correct for the presence of unseen N+ is needed to derive the
total N abundance in this case. Simpson et al. (1995) and
Rudolph et al. (2006) obtained a clearly negative gradient
or a step ﬁt with two levels of N/O, indicating a substan-
tial enhancement of the N/O ratio in the inner part of the
Galactic disc. As it was discussed by Esteban & Garc´ıa-
Rojas (2018), an almost ﬂat N/O gradient is an odd result;
however, M31 shows a similar behaviour. The only determi-
nations of the N/O gradient based on the measurement of
Te in H ii regions of M31 also obtain rather ﬂat slopes (Zu-
rita & Bresolin 2012; Esteban et al. 2020), with an average
N/O ratio similar to the Galactic value. This result would
indicate that the bulk of N should have a primary origin in

these two galaxies. Diﬀerent extensive studies using strong-
line methods for estimating abundances indicate that the
vast majority of spiral galaxies show a negative radial N/O
gradient (e.g. Pilyugin et al. 2004; P´erez-Montero et al. 2016;
Belﬁore et al. 2017). However, P´erez-Montero et al. (2016)
using spectra of H ii regions of a sample of 350 spiral galax-
ies from the CALIFA survey, ﬁnd that about 4-10% of them
display a ﬂat or positive N/O gradient. Those authors do
not ﬁnd diﬀerences in the average integrated properties of
the subset of galaxies with ﬂat or inverted N/O gradient
and their whole sample, concluding the absence of special
features that could explain this odd behavior. Although the
origin of the observed trend between the N/O and O/H ra-
tios is a controversial issue (e.g. McCall et al. 1985; Thuan
et al. 1995; Henry et al. 2000; Izotov et al. 2006; Vincenzo
et al. 2016; Vincenzo & Kobayashi 2018), the presence of a
ﬂat N/O versus O/H trend in a galactic disc has a diﬃcult –
and perhaps non-unique – explanation. One possibility has
been proposed by Vincenzo & Kobayashi (2018), who per-
formed hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of galaxies
using the stellar yield set by Kobayashi et al. (2011), ﬁnd-
ing almost ﬂat trends in N/O versus O/H diagrams when
ignoring the contribution of failed supernovae. On the other
hand, Vincenzo et al. (2016) highlight the importance of the
star-formation eﬃciency (SFE) in regulating the value of the
N/O ratio for a given O abundance. A lower SFE results in
a lower production of oxygen per unit time by massive stars,
decreasing the O/H ratio of the corresponding regions. As
the N enrichment should be delayed with respect to O, the
N/O ratio will increase. Therefore, radial changes of SFE
along the galactic discs may – in principle – produce the
observed behavior.

Fig. 11 shows the C/H and C/O ratios for 11 H ii re-
gions as a function of their RG using – as it was stated in
§ 4.2.1 – the ICF proposed by Berg et al. (2019). We have
made a least-square linear ﬁt to the data obtaining slopes
of −0.072 ± 0.018 dex kpc−1 for C/H and −0.037 ± 0.016 dex
kpc−1 for C/O. Using the ICF by Garnett et al. (1999),
Esteban et al. (2005) derived the gradients of C/H and
C/O ratios using eight Galactic H ii regions that form part
of our own sample. These authors obtained a slope of =
−0.103 ± 0.018 dex kpc−1 and = −0.058 ± 0.018 dex kpc−1 for
the radial gradient of C/H and C/O, respectively, which are
steeper than the ones we calculate. Fig. 11 also shows the
comparison between the gradients for C/H and C/O ratios
determined in this work and the ones obtained by Esteban
et al. (2005). As we already discussed in § 4.2.1, the main
diﬀerence between the C/H ratios obtained by Esteban et al.
(2005) and our estimates is the ICF scheme used. Our new
estimates of the C/H and C/O ratios show similar scatter
around the computed gradients of of 0.10-0.11 dex, which
is only marginally larger than the typical observational un-
certainty of each magnitude (about ±0.08 dex). It is easy to
note that the value of the slope in both panels of Fig. 11
is rather dependent on the position of the H ii region M17,
which is located at the smallest RG and shows the highest
C/H and C/O ratios. In Fig. 11 it is evident that the solar
C/H and C/O ratios recommended by Lodders (2019) coin-
cide with the nebular values predicted by the gradients at
the RG of the Sun. This behaviour can be explained attend-
ing to two reasons. Firstly, as it was stated in § 3.2, the C/H
ratio has been determined from RLs (as well as the C/O ra-

Panel (a) of Fig. 12 shows the radial distribution of
Ne/H ratios and the computed radial gradient. We obtain a
slope of −0.047 ± 0.011 dex kpc−1 for this gradient, with a
dispersion around the ﬁt of 0.17 dex, which is steeper but
marginally consistent with our O/H gradient within the er-
rors. However, the Ne/H gradient we obtain using the ICF
scheme by ADIS20 gives a slope almost identical to that
of O/H (see Table 8). Mart´ın-Hern´andez et al. (2002) re-
ported the Ne abundance gradient based on observations
in the IR wavelengths for a sample of 25 H ii regions cov-
ering RG between 0 and 15 kpc. Those authors reported a
slope of −0.039 ± 0.009 dex kpc−1, which is also consistent
with our determinations using optical data. However, the
intercept of our gradient is 0.3–0.4 dex lower than the value
obtained by Mart´ın-Hern´andez et al. (2002) using IR data.
Oﬀsets between IR and optical data have also been reported
in other abundances and abundance ratios, such as the S/H
and N/O ratios (Rudolph et al. 2006). Other determinations
of the Galactic Ne/H gradient from IR data are from Simp-
son & Rubin (1990) and Simpson et al. (1995), who obtain
a signiﬁcantly steeper slope of ≈ −0.083 dex kpc−1.

The radial distribution of S/H ratios and the corre-
sponding gradient are shown in panel (b) of Fig. 12. We
obtain a slope of −0.035 ± 0.006 dex kpc−1 (very similar to
the one we obtain with the ICF of ADIS20, as can be seen in
Table 8), which is consistent with the one of −0.041 ± 0.014
dex kpc−1 estimated by Rudolph et al. (2006) using FIR
lines and also very similar to the slope of our O/H gradient.
We report a dispersion around the S/H gradient of 0.10 dex,
somewhat larger than the individual observational uncer-
tainties. Recently, Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al. (2017) reported
a slope of −0.108 ± 0.006 dex kpc−1 using optical spectra for
H ii regions located at RG between 5 and 17 kpc. That value
of the slope is considerably much steeper than our determi-
nation and other previous estimates from the literature (e.g.
Shaver et al. 1983; Simpson et al. 1995; Aﬄerbach et al.
1997; Rudolph et al. 2006). Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018)
observed some H ii regions with a very low ionization degree
– O2+/O < 0.03 – but measurable [S iii] 6312 or 9069 ˚A lines.
For such nebulae is possible to assume that S/H ≈ S+/H+ +
S2+/H+, since the contribution of S3+/H+ in those objects is
expected to be negligible. The objects with such properties
are IC 5146, Sh 2-235, Sh 2-257 and Sh 2-271, whose total
abundances of S/H range from 6.70 to 7.01 but, unfortu-
nately, cover a rather narrow range of RG – between 9.3 and
11.7 kpc – and no conﬁdent gradient can be estimated with
so small baseline. Inspecting tables 3 and 4 we can see that
there is a sizable group of low-ionization degree H ii regions
that lack of determination of their S2+/H+ ratios. This is
because the rather faint auroral [S iii] 6312 ˚A line could not
be detected in those objects. We plan to obtain additional
optical spectra covering the bright nebular [S iii] 9069, 9532
˚A lines of that group of nebulae for trying to increase the
number of objects with S/H ratios determined without ICF
and estimate a more precise gradient for this element.

Panel (c) of Fig. 12 shows the radial distribution of Cl/H
for 18 H ii regions of our sample. The empty stars indicate
those regions whose Cl/H ratio has been derived without
using an ICF scheme and were previously studied by Es-
teban et al. (2015) (see also Arellano-C´ordova, Esteban &
Garc´ıa-Rojas 2019). We obtain a slope of −0.030 ± 0.007 dex
kpc−1 and a scatter around the ﬁt of 0.11 dex (see Table 8).

tio, because the O abundance used to derive that magnitude
has also been determined from RLs), and the abundance dis-
crepancy would not aﬀect the abundances and their ratios.
Secondly, from what was discussed in § 4.1, we expect that
dust depletion onto dust grains aﬀects O/H and C/H ratios
in a similar way.

5.2 Ne, S, Cl and Ar abundance gradients

In Fig. 12, we present the radial distributions and gradients
for Ne, S, Cl and Ar abundances as well as for the Ne/O,
S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O abundance ratios for our sample of
Galactic H ii regions based on the total abundances shown
in Table 6. We have identiﬁed with empty stars those neb-
ulae in which the total abundance of a given element was
calculated without using an ICF scheme. As in the elements
discussed in § 5.1, we performed a least-squares linear ﬁt
to compute the gradients taking into account the uncertain-
ties in both axes using Monte Carlo simulations. Note that
our total abundance determinations include the uncertain-
ties of the ICF. The computed gradients are represented as
red solid lines in the diﬀerent panels of Fig. 12. The solar
symbols indicate the solar abundance for each element – or
their abundance ratios with respect to O – recommended by
Lodders (2019). Table 5 includes the adopted solar Ne/O,
S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O abundance ratios (Lodders 2019).

regions in the Milky Way. The empty stars in some of the panels represent objects where the S or Cl abundances have been determined
without using an ICF scheme. The solar symbol at 8.2 kpc indicate the solar abundances recommended by Lodders (2019). The red
solid lines indicate the least-squares linear ﬁts to the data. The gray band represents the dispersion of the individual observational data
around the ﬁt, see Table 5.

This slope is ﬂatter than the value of −0.043 ± 0.012 dex
kpc−1 reported by Esteban et al. (2015) considering only
the 9 objects for which Cl abundance was determined with-
out using an ICF scheme. This discrepancy is mainly due to
our procedure to calculate the Cl2+/H+ ratio (see § 4.2.1).
Note that the radial gradient of Cl/H determined in this
study includes a number of objects with direct determina-
tions of abundances considerably larger than any other pre-
vious work.

Panel (d) of Fig. 12 shows the radial abundance gradi-
ent of Ar/H as a function of RG for 15 H ii regions, those for
which we can apply the ICF by Izotov et al. (2006). We ob-
tained a slope of −0.049 ± 0.005 and a dispersion around the
ﬁt of 0.11 dex. The slope we found applying the ICF scheme
by ADIS20 is almost the same, −0.046 ± 0.013. Previous de-
terminations of the Ar/H gradient obtained steeper slopes,
as those by Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al. (2017) of −0.074 ± 0.006
dex kpc−1, or by Shaver et al. (1983) of −0.060 ± 0.015 dex
kpc−1. However, Mart´ın-Hern´andez et al. (2002) using IR

lines of H ii regions located at RG in the range 0-13 kpc, re-
ported a slope of −0.045±0.011 dex kpc−1, in good agreement
with our results.

In all the left panels (a-d) of Fig. 12, we can see that
the solar abundances recommended by Lodders (2019) are
always above he nebular values predicted by our gradients
at the RG of the Sun. The value of the oﬀset is 0.35, 0.22,
0.24 and 0.26 dex for Ne/H, S/H, Cl/H and Ar/H, respec-
tively. As it has been discussed in the cases of the O and
N gradients, those oﬀsets can be explained by the eﬀect of
the abundance discrepancy (and temperature ﬂuctuations if
both phenomena are related) when determining abundances
from CELs. Considering the results of several previous pa-
pers for Galactic H ii regions (Esteban et al. 2004, 2013;
Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2004, 2005, 2007, 2006), we estimate that
the average underestimation factor of the Ne/H, S/H, Cl/H
and Ar/H ratios when temperature ﬂuctuations are consid-
ered is quite similar and about 0.20 dex, in reasonable agree-
ment with the observed oﬀsets.

We have also determined the gradients of Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O
and Ar/O abundance ratios as a function of RG. These gra-
dients are shown through the right-hand panels (e-h) of
Fig. 12. The parameters of our least-squares linear ﬁts are
listed in Table 8 in columns 8 to 10. O, Ne, S and Ar are con-
sidered α-elements, which are synthesized in massive stars by
α-particle capture. Therefore, their abundances should vary
in lockstep and the abundance ratio of Ne, S and Ar with re-
spect to O should be constant. In Table 8, we can note that
our slope of the log(S/O) gradient is ﬂat, but in the cases
of log(Ne/O) and log(Ar/O) are slightly negative. However,
the slope we obtain for log(Ne/O) with the ICF scheme by
ADIS20 is almost perfectly ﬂat, and that of log(Ar/O) be-
comes actually nearly ﬂat. As it has been discussed in § 4.2,
part of the trends of the abundance ratios are modulated by
the ICF scheme and the Te structure assumed. This suggest
that the set of ICFs by ADIS20 seems to better reproduce
the behaviour of the abundances of the ionic species of Ne
and Ar in our H ii regions.

Cl is an element of the group of halogens, which also
includes F, Br and I. Its most common isotopes are 35Cl
and 37Cl and both are expected to be produced during oxy-
gen burning in stars (Woosley & Weaver 1995; Pagel 1997).
Clayton (2003) indicates that 35Cl can be produced by pro-
ton capture by a 34S nucleus, since 37Cl is produced by ra-
dioactive decay of 37Ar, which is formed by neutron capture
by 36Ar. As we can see, Cl is produced by single proton or
neutron captures by isotopes of α-elements and, therefore,
we also expect a lockstep evolution of O and Cl and a con-
stant log(Cl/O) ratio across the Milky Way disc. Our result
is entirely consistent with a ﬂat gradient within the errors
and also with the previous determination by Esteban et al.
(2015). Those authors reported a slope of −0.001 ± 0.014 dex
kpc−1 for log(Cl/O) with their sample of 9 H ii regions with-
out using an ICF scheme.

As it has been discussed in § 4.1 and can be noted in
Table 5 and Fig. 12, the average values of the abundance
ratios of Ne, S, Cl and Ar with respect to O obtained with
our adopted ICFs are in good agreement with the solar ones
compiled by Lodders (2019) within the uncertainties (the
diﬀerences are smaller than 0.04 dex except in the case of
Ne/O, whose diﬀerence is 0.1 dex). Our abundance ratios
are also fairly consistent with the values obtained by Este-
ban et al. (2020) from deep spectra of H ii regions of the
nearby massive spiral galaxies M31 and M101. Especially in
the cases of S/O and Cl/O although Esteban et al. (2020)
use the ICF scheme by Izotov et al. (2006). However, as it
is also discussed in § 4.1, the nebular Ne/O, Ar/O, and per-
haps S/O and Cl/O ratios should be aﬀected by diﬀerential
depletion factors when comparing with solar abundance ra-
tios. In the case of the nebular Ar/O, we have to subtract
0.1 dex to compare with the solar values, however, this is not
supported by our results. For Ne/O the expected behaviour
is similar to Ar/O, however, the Ne solar abundance is quite
uncertain and still debatable (see § 4.2.3). In the cases of
S/O and Cl/O, due to the unknown depletion factors of S
and Cl, the amount to be subtracted to the nebular ratio
may be between 0 and 0.1 dex, however, panels (f) and (g)
of Fig. 12 suggest that the correction for depletion, if any,
should be small.

and some spiral galaxies

PNe provide crucial information about the nucleosynthesis
and chemical evolution of diﬀerent elements. It is thought
that PNe progenitors do not synthesize O and other α-
elements as Ne, S or Ar and, in principle, they can be con-
sidered as probes of the chemical composition of the ISM
at the moment of the birth of the progenitors. Therefore,
they can be used as tracers of the temporal evolution of
the abundance gradients of the Galaxy. However, the recent
results by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2015) indicate the produc-
tion of O in C-rich PNe at near-solar metallicties that can
increase the O/H ratio up to 0.3 dex. This result calls into
question the suitability of O in PNe as tracer of the ISM
composition. Other critical problems in the determination
of the abundance gradients from PNe data is the large un-
certainties in the distances of these objects (Frew et al. 2016;
Stanghellini & Haywood 2018; Pe˜na & Flores-Dur´an 2019;
Garc´ıa-Rojas 2020a), the diﬀerent range of ages of their pro-
genitors and the radial migration along the lifetime of the
progenitors. Most of the determinations of the Galactic O/H
gradient based on data of young PNe – with ages between
1 and 4 Gyr – provide slopes which tend to be ﬂatter than
our value (Liu et al. 2004; Maciel et al. 2015; Stanghellini
& Haywood 2018; Pe˜na & Flores-Dur´an 2019), with typical
values in the range between −0.019 and −0.048 dex kpc−1
for RG between 0 and 16 kpc. This behaviour has led some
authors to propose the steeping of the O gradient with time
(e.g. Stanghellini & Haywood 2018). However, other authors
as Henry et al. (2004) or Maciel & Costa (2013) claim that
the time variation of the O/H gradient may be masked by
the aforementioned uncertainties related to the abundance
and gradient determination with PNe. As α-elements, Ne, S
and Ar should have abundance gradients similar to that of
O/H, but as it has been discussed in § 4.2, their value may
be aﬀected by the ICF scheme used. For Ne and Ar, Pe˜na
& Flores-Dur´an (2019) reported a slope of −0.026 ± 0.014
dex kpc−1 and −0.010 ± 0.006 dex kpc−1, respectively, for a
sample of young PNe, which are ﬂatter than our slopes for
these elements in H ii regions. Henry et al. (2004) studied a
large sample of PNe providing the radial gradients for the
diﬀerent elements studied here but for a sample of objects
covering progenitors of a wide range of ages. Those authors
reported values of the slope for the gradients of Ne, S, Cl
and Ar abundances fairly similar to ours, from −0.030 to
−0.048 dex kpc−1. On the other hand, the results obtained
by Stanghellini & Haywood (2018) for their compilation of
PNe data from the literature show slopes of Ne and Ar which
are somewhat ﬂatter than ours, −0.018 to −0.030 dex kpc−1,
respectively. As we can see, the comparison with available
data from PNe does not give conclusive evidence of a time
variation of the abundance gradients in the Milky Way.

Cepheids are also important tracers of the chemical
composition of the ISM, further, their RG is well-determined
– they are considered standard candles – and the chemi-
cal abundances of a large number of elements can be esti-
mated (Andrievsky et al. 2002b). These stars are relatively
young, younger than the PNe progenitors but older than
H ii regions. The diﬀerent gradients of O/H obtained from
Cepheids show a wide range of variation, from −0.023 to
−0.080 dex kpc−1 (see the compilation by Moll´a et al. 2019,

24 K. Z. Arellano-C´ordova et al.

and references therein). A recent analysis of results of a large
sample of Galactic Cepheids – with O/H ratios with average
uncertainties of about 0.12 dex – obtains a slope for the O/H
gradient of −0.055 ± 0.003 dex kpc−1, somewhat steeper than
ours (Maciel & Andrievsky 2019). Measurements of C/H ra-
tios in Cepheids give slopes of the gradient between −0.055
dex kpc−1 and −0.080 dex kpc−1 (Andrievsky et al. 2002a;
Luck & Lambert 2011; Luck 2014), which are quite in agree-
ment with our result for H ii regions. Also, we obtain con-
sistent results with the slopes of the N/H gradient derived
by Luck & Lambert (2011) and Luck (2014) from Cepheids,
which values are between −0.046 dex kpc−1 and −0.051 dex
kpc−1. In the case of the S abundance gradient, our value of
the slope is in agreement with the one of −0.051 dex kpc−1
reported by Andrievsky et al. (2002a) but not with that ob-
tained with Luck (2014), who report a slope of −0.093 dex
kpc−1, signiﬁcantly steeper than our result.

As H ii regions, young OB stars can also be tracers of
the present-day chemical composition of the ISM. The slopes
of the gradients of N/H, O/H and S/H obtained by Daﬂon &
Cunha (2004) are consistent with our determinations within
the uncertainties, but not in the case of C/H. For this ele-
ment, Daﬂon & Cunha (2004) obtain a signiﬁcantly ﬂatter
slope of −0.037 ± 0.010 dex kpc−1. In contrast, our result
for C/H is consistent with the gradient derived by Rolleston
et al. (2000) for OB stars, who reported a slope of −0.070
dex kpc−1.

Finally, we compare the Galactic gradients of Table 8
with those ones obtained for other nearby spiral galaxies. To
make that comparison appropriately, we have recalculated
the Galactic gradients using the fractional Galactocentric
distance with respect to the disc eﬀective radius – RG/Re
– of the H ii regions. The convenience of this normalization
compared to RG/R25 is discussed in Esteban et al. (2020).
The corresponding slopes of such re-normalization are shown
in columns 4 and 9 of Table 8. The eﬀective radius, Re, con-
tains the half of the total light emitted by the system (e.g.
S´anchez et al. 2012; Moll´a et al. 2019; Esteban et al. 2020).
We have considered the value of Re = 4.55 kpc adopted by
Esteban et al. (2020) for the Milky Way, which is obtained
applying the relation Re = 1.678 × Rd (S´anchez et al. 2014) to
the value of the scale length, Rd, obtained by Licquia et al.
(2016) (see more details in Esteban et al. 2020). In Table 9
we include the slopes of the O/H, C/H, S/H and N/O gradi-
ents with respect to RG/Re for the Milky Way – our results
– and recent determinations for the following spiral galax-
ies: M33 and NGC 300 (Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016),
M101 and M31 (Esteban et al. 2020) and four galaxies of
the CHAOS project: NGC 628, NGC 3184, NGC 5194 and
M101 (Berg et al. 2020). All these determinations from the
literature have been selected because they are based on deep
spectroscopy of H ii regions which abundances are based on
the direct method (Te-sensitive method). In the table, we
also give the morphological type, Re and the absolute B-
band magnitude (MB) of the galaxies. The values of Re have
been taken from Esteban et al. (2020) and Berg et al. (2020).
From Table 8, we can see that the slope of the O/H gra-
dient of the diﬀerent galaxies is rather similar, with a range
between −0.07 and −0.24 dex (RG/Re)−1, with an average
value of −0.15 ± 0.05 dex (RG/Re)−1. The galaxy with the
ﬂattest O/H gradient, NGC 5194, may be aﬀected by inter-
actions with its companion, NGC 5195, resulting in radial

migration and mixing of the gas (see discussion in Croxall
et al. 2015). Removing that galaxy – the only interacting
one of the sample – the average slope is slightly modiﬁed to
−0.17±0.04 dex (RG/Re)−1. We do not ﬁnd any correlation of
the value of the slope with MB or the morphological type of
the galaxy. The average slope of this small sample of galaxies
is steeper than the characteristic slope obtained from large
surveys using strong-line methods for estimating the O/H
ratio. In fact, S´anchez-Menguiano et al. (2016), using the
O3N2 calibrator, obtain an average slope of −0.075 ± 0.016
dex (RG/Re)−1 for a sample of 122 face-on galaxies of the
CALIFA survey, while S´anchez-Menguiano et al. (2018) for
a sample of 102 spiral galaxies observed with MUSE and
using the same calibrator, obtain a characteristic slope of
−0.10 ± 0.03 dex (RG/Re)−1.

The slope of the C/H gradient is very similar for the
galaxies included in Table 8 except in the case of M31. How-
ever, the value for this galaxy is rather uncertain because it
is based on only two H ii regions and other reasons outlined
in Esteban et al. (2020). It is remarkable that the slope is
the same, −0.33 dex (RG/Re)−1, in the Milky Way, M33 and
M101, precisely those galaxies whose C/H gradient is deter-
mined with more objects and having better determinations
of individual C abundances. The slopes of the S/H gradients
do not show large variations, the mean value of the sample of
Table 8 is −0.23±0.07 dex (RG/Re)−1, somewhat steeper than
the O/H one, although this is not the case for the Milky Way,
where we ﬁnd the same slopes for both α-elements. The slope
of the N/O gradient shows a comparatively larger variation
than the other ones included in Table 8. The mean slope
of N/O is −0.21 ± 0.10 dex (RG/Re)−1. The object with the
ﬂattest slope is the Milky Way. Removing it, the mean slope
of N/O becomes slightly steeper −0.24 ± 0.08 dex (RG/Re)−1.
In § 5.1 we discussed about the infrequency of ﬂat N/O gra-
dients in galaxies and its possible explanations.

In their comparison between the abundances of M31 and
M101 and other galaxies including the Milky way, Esteban
et al. (2020) ﬁnd that the H ii regions of the Milky Way show
O, C and N abundances larger than other galaxies for the
same RG/Re ratio. This fact is conﬁrmed with our new results
and indicates that the Milky Way seems to have an average
metallicity at Re larger than other more massive and lumi-
nous galaxies as M31 or M101, in contradiction with what
we would expect from the mass-metallicity relation. Este-
ban et al. (2020) proposed that this odd behavior might be
solved if the true Re is about two times larger than the most
recent determinations. This seems also a likely possibility at-
tending to other reasons collected in Esteban et al. (2020).
The adoption of a larger Re for the Milky Way would not
aﬀect the values of the slopes we obtain for the gradients.

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We compile deep spectroscopical data for a sample of 33
Galactic H ii regions from the literature to carry out a re-
analysis of the radial abundance gradients of C, N, O, Ne,
S, Cl and Ar of the Milky Way. The physical conditions and
chemical abundances of the nebulae have been calculated in
a homogeneous way using an updated and carefully selected
set of atomic data. All the nebulae have direct determina-
tions of Te, permitting to derive their precise ionic abun-

dances. We have made a revision of the RG of the objects
using Gaia parallaxes of the second data release, DR2 (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2018; Bailer-Jones et al. 2018). The sam-
ple covers a range of RG from 6 to 17 kpc. Apart from O, we
can determine the total abundances of N, Cl and S without
using an ICF for several nebulae, being the number of ob-
jects relatively large in the cases of N and Cl. We compare
the suitability of diﬀerent ICF schemes for the determination
of the total abundances of the elements studied here taking
into account: (a) the dispersion of the distribution of abun-
dance ratios with respect to O (i.e. N/O, Ne/O, etc) versus
the O/H ratio; (b) the comparison of the average values of
those abundance ratios with the solar ones and (c) the com-
parison with abundances determined without ICF. We have
selected the results of particular diﬀerent ICF schemes as
the ﬁnal adopted total abundances of the diﬀerent elements.
Since the results of the recent ICF scheme by ADIS20 pro-
vides robust (or the most robust in some cases) results for
most elements (C, N, Ne, S and Ar) we decide not to use
them because the scheme is not published at the moment
of the writing of this paper. In any case, the abundances
obtained with the ﬁnally selected ICFs have similar level of
conﬁdence. For α-elements (we include also Cl because it
is a byproduct of α-elements), for which we expect a con-
stant abundance ratio with respect to O, we obtain the fol-
lowing average values: log(Ne/O) = −0.71 ± 0.15, log(S/O)
= −1.58 ± 0.08, log(Cl/O) = −3.48 ± 0.10 and log(Ar/O) =
−2.27 ± 0.11, similar to the ratios obtained very recently for
M31 or M101 and fairly consistent with the solar values.
This last result does not support the presence of a sizable
fraction of O depleted onto dust grains in the ionized gas of
H ii regions. The ICF by Berg et al. (2019) gives an average
log(C/O) = −0.27 ± 0.14, entirely consistent with the solar
value. In the case of log(N/O), the average ratio obtained
for objects whose N abundances has been derived without an
ICF (−0.76±0.09) is somewhat higher than the one obtained
using an ICF (−0.90 ± 0.11, more consistent with the solar
value). Only the ﬁrst case is consistent with the claimed 0.10
dex depletion of O in H ii regions.

We have made a reassessment of the radial abundance
gradients for the diﬀerent elements in our Galaxy. Our new
gradient of O (with a slope of −0.037 ± 0.009 dex kpc−1)
is in agreement with the most recent determinations, but
our revised RG based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes produce a

MNRAS 000, 1–28 (2020)

systematic shift of the values of the innermost objects to-
wards larger RG. This implies that the possible ﬂattening
of the gradient at RG < 7-8 kpc suggested by Esteban &
Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) might be a spurious eﬀect due to incor-
rect previous determinations of RG. Moreover, we have found
that a quadratic ﬁt to the radial O/H distribution does not
improve the ﬁtting, and that a linear gradient seems suﬃ-
cient to represent the data. The slope of the N/H gradient
is similar to that of O/H, implying a rather ﬂat gradient
of log(N/O) (with a slope of −0.011 ± 0.006 dex kpc−1), a
result which is consistent with previous determinations for
the Milky Way and M31 but rather uncommon in other spi-
ral galaxies. The dispersion around the ﬁt for the O and
N gradients (when no-ICF correction is made for N) is of
0.07 dex, not substantially larger than the typical uncer-
tainties of individual abundance determinations, implying
that the gas of the ISM is well-mixed, discarding the exis-
tence of signiﬁcant azimuthal gradients, at least in the ob-
served quadrant of the Milky Way. On the other hand, we
ﬁnd slopes ranging from −0.030 to −0.049 dex kpc−1 for Ne,
S, Cl and Ar abundance gradients, with actually ﬂat slopes
for log(S/O) and log(Cl/O) and relatively ﬂat for log(Ne/O)
and log(Ar/O), although this behaviour varies with the ICF
scheme used. For example, using the ICF scheme by ADIS20,
the log(Ne/O) gradient becomes ﬂat, and the log(Ar/O) also
ﬂattens. Note that our new determination for the Cl abun-
dance gradient includes a signiﬁcant larger number of ob-
jects than previous determinations. We also highlight that
the dispersion around the ﬁt of the S, Cl and Ar gradients
are about 0.11 dex, again of the order of the observational
errors considering the additional uncertainty associated with
the ICFs. This result further reinforces the absence of sig-
niﬁcant inhomogeneities in the ISM gas across the Galactic
disc. In the case of Ne, the dispersion is much higher, of
0.17-0.19 dex, mainly due to the intrinsic uncertainties of
the ICF schemes for this element. We determine the C gra-
dient with a sample of 11 H ii regions with measurements of
C2+ and O2+ RLs. The value of the slope is −0.072 ± 0.018
dex kpc−1, much steeper than the gradients of the rest of el-
ements. We ﬁnd that for all the elements whose abundance
has been derived from the intensity of CELs (all except C),
the solar abundance ratios are always above the nebular ones
predicted by our gradients at the RG of the Sun by factors
between 0.2 and 0.3 dex. These oﬀsets may be produced by

26 K. Z. Arellano-C´ordova et al.

the abundance discrepancy (perhaps related to temperature
ﬂuctuations), implying that nebular abundances determined
from CELs may be lower than the true ones, perhaps better
represented by the abundances determined from RLs.

In general, the slopes of our gradients are consistent
with those obtained from data of other kinds of objects
(PNe, young OB stars and Cepheids). However, the large
dispersion of the slope values obtained for those objects by
the diﬀerent research groups does not give conclusive results
about the possible temporal evolution of the gradients.

Finally, we compare the Galactic radial gradients of the
O/H, N/H, S/H and N/O ratios normalized to Re with those
of other nearby spiral galaxies with direct determination of
abundances of their H ii regions. We ﬁnd that the slope of
the O abundance gradient is very similar to that of other
non-interacting spirals, with a mean slope of −0.17±0.04 dex
(RG/Re)−1, independently of their MB or morphological type.
However, this mean value of the slope is steeper than the
characteristic one obtained in large surveys that use strong-
line methods for estimating the O/H ratio for large samples
of spirals. Those surveys ﬁnd slope values between −0.075
and −0.10 dex (RG/Re)−1. It is remarkable that the slope of
the C abundance gradient we ﬁnd for the Milky Way, −0.33
dex (RG/Re)−1, is exactly the same that Esteban et al. (2020)
obtain for M33 and M101, precisely the external galaxies
with better determinations of nebular C/H ratios. The slope
of the N/O gradient shows a relatively large variation, from
−0.05 to −0.36 dex (RG/Re)−1, being the Milky Way precisely
the galaxy with the ﬂattest slope of the N/O gradient. Our
results conﬁrm the ﬁndings of Esteban et al. (2020), who
reported that the H ii regions of the Milky Way show larger
O, C and N abundances than other galaxies for the same
RG/Re ratio. This odd behavior might be solved if the true
Re is about two times larger than commonly accepted.
