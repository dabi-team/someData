ABSTRACT
Solar active region (AR) 12673 produced 4 X-class, 27 M-class, and numerous lower class ﬂares
during its passage across the visible solar disk in September 2017. Our study is to answer the questions
why this AR was so ﬂare-productive and how the X9.3 ﬂare, the largest one of the last decade, took
place. We ﬁnd that there was a sunspot in the initial several days, and then two bipolar regions
emerged nearby it successively. Due to the standing of the pre-existing sunspot, the movement of the
bipoles was blocked, while the pre-existing sunspot maintained its quasi-circular shaped umbra only
with the disappearance of a part of penumbra. Thus, the bipolar patches were signiﬁcantly distorted,
and the opposite polarities formed two semi-circular shaped structures. After that, two sequences of
new bipolar regions emerged within the narrow semi-circular zone, and the bipolar patches separated
along the curved channel. The new bipoles sheared and interacted with the previous ones, forming
a complex topological system, during which numerous ﬂares occurred. At the highly sheared region,
a great deal of free energy was accumulated. On September 6, one negative patch near the polarity
inversion line began to rapidly rotate and shear with the surrounding positive ﬁelds, and consequently
the X9.3 ﬂare erupted. Our results reveal that the block-induced complex structures built the ﬂare-
productive AR and the X9.3 ﬂare was triggered by an erupting ﬁlament due to the kink instability.
To better illustrate this process, a block-induced eruption model is proposed for the ﬁrst time.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar ﬂares are powerful energy release phenomena on
the Sun, and magnetic reconnection is deemed to be
the most eﬀective mechanism of the rapid energy release
(e.g., Sturrock 1966; Masuda et al. 1994; Yang et al.
2014). Magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation were
found to be favorable for ﬂare occurrence and coronal
mass ejection (CME) onset (Wang & Shi 1993; Zirin &
Wang 1993; Schmieder et al. 1997; Chen & Shibata 2000;
Zhang et al. 2001; Sterling et al. 2010; Louis et al. 2015).
Eruptions can be triggered through the reconnection be-
tween the emerging ﬂux and the pre-existing ﬂux. In a
statistical study of 77 X-class and M-class ﬂares by Burt-
seva & Petrie (2013), the results revealed the importance
of ﬂux cancellation in triggering the ﬂares. At the po-
larity inversion lines (PILs), the magnetic gradients are
steep and the horizontal ﬁelds are highly sheared. Since
the stressed magnetic ﬁelds contain a great deal of free
energy, large ﬂares tend to take place in the vicinity of the
PILs (Sun et al. 2012; Song et al. 2013). The rapid shear
ﬂows in the photosphere are thought to play an crucial
role in the buildup of free energy to power solar ﬂares
(Harvey & Harvey 1976; Meunier & Kosovichev 2003;
Yang et al. 2004). In a study of Shimizu et al. (2014),
strong ﬂows along the ﬂaring PIL of an X5.4 ﬂare were
observed before and after the ﬂare, which were argued

to shear the magnetic ﬁelds and increase the free energy
to power the major ﬂare. Besides the photospheric shear
ﬂows, sunspot rotation is also an important mechanism
for triggering major ﬂares (Brown et al. 2003; Zhang et
al. 2007; Yan et al. 2009; Vemareddy et al. 2016).

Solar active region (AR) 12673 erupted with a series
of ﬂares, including 4 X-class and 27 M-class, from Sept.
4 to Sept. 10, 2017. The X9.3 ﬂare on Sept. 6 is the
largest one in Solar Cycle 24. One may be interested in
the questions: (1) Why was this AR so ﬂare-productive?
(2) How did the X9.3 ﬂare occur? The present paper is
dedicated to answering these two questions.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer
et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO ; Pesnell et al. 2012) provides
the full-disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms and in-
tensity maps with the pixel size of 0′′.5 and the cadence of
45 seconds. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) on board the SDO observes the Sun
in ten (E)UV channels with the spatial sampling of 0′′.6
pixel−1 and the cadence of (12)24 seconds. We use the
HMI LOS magnetograms and intensity maps and AIA
multi-wavelength images from Sept. 1 to Sept. 10 with
a 15 min cadence, the data on Sept. 6 with a 3 min
cadence, and the two hour data around the X9.3 ﬂare
with full cadence. All of them are calibrated to Level
2 using the standard routine under the Solar Software
package. Then the data from Sept. 1 to Sept. 7 are dif-
ferentially rotated to the reference time of 20:00 UT on
Sept. 3. In addition, we also employ the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES ) data with
the 1 min cadence to examine the variation of soft X-ray
1-8 ˚A ﬂux.

Yang et al.

SDO /HMI also measures the full-disk vector magnetic
ﬁelds with the spatial sampling of 0.′′5 pixel−1, and the
inverted vector magnetograms using VFISV inversion
code (Borrero et al. 2011) have a cadence of 12 min.
We adopt two full-disk disambiguated magnetograms ob-
served at 12:00 UT on Sept. 3 and at 09:48 UT on
Sept. 6. Then the vector magnetic ﬁeld at each pixel
in the image plane is transformed to the heliographic
components with the formulae given by Gary & Hag-
yard (1990). Moreover, we perform the geometric map-
ping of the magnetograms into the heliographic coordi-
nates. Based on the photospheric vector magnetograms,
we reconstruct the coronal structures using the nonlin-
ear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) modeling (Wheatland et al.
2000; Wiegelmann 2004). Before the extrapolation, the
magnetograms are preprocessed to best suit the force-free
conditions (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). The extrapolation
is performed in the cubic box of 512×512×256 uniformly
spaced grid points with ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 0.′′5. AR
12673 is located at the center of the photospheric bound-
ary. Furthermore, we use the code developed by Liu et al.
(2016) to calculate the squashing factor Q (D´emoulin et
al. 1996; Titov et al. 2002) and twist number Tw (Berger
& Prior 2006) of the reconstructed magnetic ﬁeld.

3. RESULTS
Beginning on Sept. 4, AR 12673 erupted a series of
ﬂares during its passage across the visible solar disk. Ta-
ble 1 shows the information of all the 4 X-class and 27
M-class ﬂares1 in AR 12673. For each ﬂare, the mean
duration is determined from the start to end time of the
ﬂare. The average duration of the X-class ﬂares is about
32 min, longer than that (26 min) of the M-class ﬂares.
Among these ﬂares, the X9.3 ﬂare occurred on Sept. 6
is the largest one since 2005.

In the initial two days of Sept., there was only one
sunspot with positive polarity within AR 12673 (see
Figure 1(a)). Then one bipolar region (labeled with
“Bipole A”) emerged at the south-east of the pre-existing
spot (panel (b)), followed by the successive emergence of
another bipolar region (“Bipole B”) at the north-east
(panel (c)). The negative polarity patches of the bipoles
moved east-ward and the positive ones moved west-ward
(see Movie1). Due to the standing of the pre-existing
spot, the west-ward motion of the positive patches was
blocked. During this process, the pre-existing spot main-
tained its quasi-circle shape with its location almost no
dramatic change. However, the left part of the penumbra
disappeared due to the conﬂict with the nearby moving
patches, as denoted by the arrows in panels (a) and (d).
Thus, the bipoles were signiﬁcantly distorted and elon-
gated around the pre-existing spot, and their positive and
negative polarities formed two semi-circular structures
(panel (d)). After that, two sequences of new bipolar re-
gions (labeled with “Bipole C” and “Bipole D”) emerged
within the narrow zone between the semi-circular struc-
tures (panel (e)). The newly emerging bipolar patches
separated along the curved path of the narrow zone, and
sheared with each other and also with the previously
emerged bipoles (from panel (e) to panel (f)).

structures of the AR exhibited in the observed vector
magnetogram were relatively simple (Figure 2(a1)). The
extrapolated coronal ﬁeld lines show that most loops con-
nect the positive ﬁelds on the west with the negative
ﬁelds on the east (panel (a2)). The extrapolated lines
are well consistent with the observed loops in the AIA
171 ˚A image (panel (a3)). However, the AR magnetic
topologies on Sept. 6 were quite complex. The vector
magnetogram in panel (b1) reveals that the magnetic
gradient between the negative patch of bipole “D” (la-
beled in Figure 1) and the encountering positive ﬁelds is
very steep, and the magnetic ﬁelds nearby the curved PIL
are highly sheared. From the extrapolated data (panel
(b2)), we can see that, there is a ﬂux rope structure out-
lined by the red ﬁeld lines above the PIL. The blue ﬁeld
lines in panel (b2) connect the opposite polarity patches
of bipoles “C” and “D” (labeled in Figure 1), respec-
tively, which coincide with the loop structures in AIA
171 ˚A image (panel (b3)). Moreover, the distribution of
the magnetic free energy calculated with the vector ﬁeld
observation at 09:48 UT on Sept. 6 is displayed in panel
(c1).
It is clear that the high free energy area (bright
region in panel (c1)) is located along the PIL of the op-
posite polarities. Along the cut marked by the green line,
we examine the Tw and Q distribution above the sheared
ﬁeld. In the Tw map, there is an ellipse region (outlined
by the green dotted curve in panel (c2)) with the high
twist number. The high Tw region is consistent with the
ﬂux rope outlined by the red lines in panel (b2). The
edge of the high twist region coincides with the high Q
as shown in panel (c3). For a magnetic ﬂux rope, the

Fig. 1.— Sequence of HMI intensity maps displaying the evolution of AR 12673. The green curves and “+” symbols mark the umbral
boundary and intensity centroid of the pre-existing spot, respectively. The blue and red contours represent the LOS magnetic ﬁelds at
+800 G and -800 G, respectively, among which the bold ones outline the newly emerging bipolar patches. The arrows in panels (a) and
(d) denote the penumbra which disappeared due to the conﬂict with the nearby moving patches. The box in panel (f) outlines the FOV of
Figures 3(b)-(e3).
An animation (Movie1.mp4) of this ﬁgure is available.

ﬁeld lines wrapping around the central axis have a simi-
lar connectivity, indicating that there indeed exists a ﬂux
rope along the PIL.

The photospheric ﬂow went on shearing the magnetic
ﬁelds near the PIL, as displayed in Figures 3(a1)-(a3) and
the associated Movie2. The large negative patch moved
north-west (indicated by the red arrow in panel (a1)),
and continuously sheared with the surrounding positive
ﬁelds. Two areas with rapid shearing motion are out-
lined by two green rectangles. The negative patch in-
truded into the positive one and split it into two parts
(from panels (a2)-(a3)). In the HMI intensity map (panel
(b)), the orientation from the intensity centroid (marked
by the red “+”) of the negative patch to that (marked
by the blue “+”) of the positive patch increased anti-
clockwise, due to the shearing motion. In addition, the
negative patch itself also rotated anti-clockwise, as de-
noted by the green curve with arrow (see Movie2). Dur-
ing this process, the X9.3 ﬂare took place, as revealed by
the variation of GOES soft X-ray ﬂux (see the inserted
white curve in panel (b)). When the ﬂare occurred, a
white light ﬂare with two ribbons can be identiﬁed in
the HMI intensity map, which is more prominent in the
intensity diﬀerence image (panel (c)). The two ribbons
were also observed in AIA 1600 ˚A image (panel (d)).
Moreover, an erupting ﬁlament was captured by AIA in
multi-wavelengths, such as 1600 ˚A, 304 ˚A, 131 ˚A, and
94 ˚A (see Movie3). Panels (e1)-(e3) show the ﬁlament
eruption in 304 ˚A. The ﬁlament (outlined by the dotted
curve in panel (e1)) was mainly located along the PIL
at 11:52:53 UT just before the occurrence of the X9.3

ﬂare, and then it was brightened during its rising motion
(panel (e2)). At 11:56:08 UT, the ﬁlament appeared as a
kink shaped structure, as indicated by the knotted curve
in panel (e3).

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
Using the HMI and AIA data, we have studied AR
12673 which erupted 31 X- and M-class ﬂares and nu-
merous lower class ones, including the largest one in So-
lar Cycle 24. We ﬁnd that two bipolar regions emerged
successively nearby the only one pre-existing spot. The
movement of the emerging patches was blocked by
the pre-existing spot and consequently distorted and
elongated, forming two semi-circular shaped structures.
Then within the semi-circular narrow region, two se-
quences of new bipoles emerged and separated along the
curved channel. The new bipoles sheared and interacted
with the surrounding ﬁelds, during which numerous ﬂares
occurred. At the PIL between the newly emerging neg-
ative ﬁelds and the surrounding positive ones, the mag-
netic ﬁelds were highly sheared, resulting in the accumu-
lation of magnetic free energy. The extrapolated coronal
ﬁelds and the calculation of the Tw and Q reveal that
there existed a ﬂux rope along the PIL. One negative
patch began to rapidly rotate and move forward, increas-
ing the shear at the PIL, and then the X9.3 ﬂare took
place. At the early stage of the ﬂare, an erupting ﬁla-
ment was observed to rise in multi-wavelength UV and
EUV images, and the ﬁlament presented a kink motion
during its eruption.

At the initial emerging stage of ARs, the magnetic
topologies are relatively simple, close to potential ﬁelds.

“C” and bipole “D” (labeled in Figure 1), respectively, and the red ﬁeld lines indicate a ﬂux rope along the PIL. In panels (c2) and (c3),
the green dotted curves outline the general shape of the ﬂux rope.

However, the photospheric ﬂows can greatly shear the
magnetic ﬁelds and make them highly non-potential.
The free energy will be stored in the non-potential ﬁeld
and can be used to power solar ﬂares, and CMEs (Schri-
jver et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2015).
In the present
study, AR 12673 evolved from a simple spot to a com-
plex system accompanied by numerous ﬂares. We sketch
a cartoon model to illustrate the formation of the com-
plex structures, as shown in Figure 4. At ﬁrst, there
only existed one sunspot (represented by the right-most
ellipse in panel (a)), and subsequently two pairs of bipo-
lar regions “A” and “B” successively emerged at its left.
Then the movement of the bipolar ﬁelds was blocked

by the pre-existing spot, and the distorted shape of the
bipoles looks like a crescent shape (panel (b)). Within
the narrow zone, bipolar regions “C” and “D” began to
emerge and separate along the semi-circular curve, and
the elongated ﬁeld lines together with the surrounding
lines formed a complex system, responsible for the con-
sequent occurrence of the ﬂares. However, besides the
bipole-blocking process, the magnetic ﬂux emergence and
cancellation may also play an important role in creating
the ﬂare-producing conditions in this AR, similar to the
previous studies (e.g., Zirin & Wang 1993; Zhang et al.
2001; Louis et al. 2015). We can see that a great deal
of magnetic ﬂux (bipoles “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D” shown

Fig. 3.— Panels (a1)-(a3): HMI LOS magnetograms with contours of ±300 G showing the rapid shearing motion around the X9.3 ﬂare.
The red arrow in panel (a1) denotes the moving direction of the negative patch, and the rectangles outline two areas with rapid shearing
motion. Panels (b) and (c): HMI intensity map at 11:53:04 UT on Sept. 6 and the intensity diﬀerence map from that of 3.5 min later
overlaid with the LOS magnetic ﬁeld contours. The red and blue “+” symbols in panel (b) mark the intensity centroids of two opposite
polarity patches, and the green curve with arrow denotes the rotation of the negative patch. The inserted white curve displays the GOES
soft-X-ray ﬂux variation of the X9.3 ﬂare. Panel (d): AIA 1600 ˚A image showing the erupting ﬁlament and the associated two ribbons.
Panels (e1)-(e3): Sequence of AIA 304 ˚A images showing the eruption process of the ﬁlament.

in Figure 1) emerged continuously to the east of the pre-
existing sunspot. Consequently, ﬂux cancellation among
these bipoles took place at some interaction areas (see
Movie1), which may contribute to the ﬂare-productivity.
For two-ribbon ﬂares and CMEs, Amari et al. (2000)
proposed a model
in which twisted ﬂux ropes repre-
senting the magnetic structures of ﬁlaments play a cru-
cial role. The erupting ﬂux ropes stretch the overlying
loops, and the reconnection takes place between the anti-
directed lines below, resulting in solar ﬂares (Shibata et
al. 1995; Lin & Forbes 2000). The ﬂux rope in this study
was located above the strong PIL shown in Figure 2, and
its two ends were anchored in the negative (on the left of
the PIL; the negative patch of bipole “D”) and positive

(right; merged from the positive ﬁelds of bipoles “C”,
“A”, and “B”, instead of “D”) polarities. The opposite
polarity patches on the two sides of the PIL were not ini-
tially connected, and their connection was formed during
the following interactions. Therefore, the ﬂux rope seems
to not emerge from below. For the formation of ﬂux
ropes, the shearing motion and rotation of sunspots are
found to play an important role (e.g., Yan et al. 2015). In
addition, magnetic diﬀusion/ﬂux-cancellation processes
at the PIL were crucial for the formation of this ﬂux rope,
e.g., illustrated by the tether-cutting model (Moore et al.
2001). As proposed by Moore et al. (2001), the sheared
magnetic arcades reconnect at their inner legs, and then
a longer twisted ﬂux rope can be formed over the PIL.

Fig. 4.— Cartoon model illustrating the block-induced eruption. In panel (a), the right-most patch represents the pre-existing spot with
the positive polarity, and the two pairs of patches at its left side connecting with ﬁeld lines are two emerging bipoles “A” and “B”. In
panel (b), the patches connecting with blue lines are two newly emerging bipoles “C” and “D” in the narrow zone between the oppositive
polarities of bipoles “A+B”. In panel (c), the braiding red and green lines form a ﬂux rope and the blue lines represent the overlying loops.
In panel (d), the red cross symbols mark the reconnection sites between the anti-directed ﬁeld lines of the stretched overlying loops due to
the ﬁlament eruption.

There are some diﬀerent mechanisms for the onset of
ﬁlament eruptions, such as magnetic breakout (Antio-
chos et al. 1999), tether-cutting (Moore et al. 2001),
kink instability (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005), and torus insta-
bility (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006). Based on the observations,
we ﬁnd that the X9.3 ﬂare on Sept. 6 was triggered by
an erupting ﬁlament due to the kink instability (Figures
3(e1)-(e3)). For a twisted ﬂux rope, the threshold value
of kink instability is mainly about |Tw|=1.75 (Torok &
Kleim 2003). The force-free model for the time 6 Sept.
09:48 UT shows the existence of the ﬂux rope above the
strong PIL (see Figure 2). The average Tw of the in-
ner part of the ﬂux rope is about −1.5, and that of the
outer part is about −1.2. After that, the rapid shearing
motion and rotation of the related magnetic structures
were observed, as shown in Figure 3 (also the associated
animation). Consequently, the twist number of the ﬂux
rope continuously increased, and ultimately reached or
even exceeded the threshold of the kink instability. This
process can be illustrated in Figures 4(c)-(d). Due to the
shearing motion of opposite polarities, a great deal of free
energy was accumulated at the PIL region. Meanwhile,
twisted ﬂux rope can be created along the highly sheared
PIL. In Figure 4(c), the braiding red and green lines
represent a ﬂux rope, corresponding to that in Figure

2. Because of the continuous shearing motion displayed
in Figures 3(a1)-(a3), the twist of the ﬂux rope conse-
quently increased. Eventually, the ﬁlament was kink un-
stable and erupted. In Figure 3(e3), the kink knot of the
ﬁlament during the eruption is the most important ob-
servational character of the kink instability. The rising
ﬁlament stretched the overlying loops (blue lines in Fig-
ure 4(d)), and then the stretched ﬁeld lines reconnected
at the sites marked by the red symbols, thus triggering
the solar ﬂare.

In the previous studies, there are mainly three types
of mechanisms for triggering major ﬂares: (1) ﬂux emer-
gence and cancellation, (2) shearing motions, and (3)
sunspot rotation. The block-induced eruption model pro-
posed in this Letter can be considered to be the fourth
mechanism. Diﬀerent from the former three ones, in our
model, there exists a standing spot which blocks the hor-
izontal movement of newly emerging patches, resulting in
the formation of complex sheared structures. Using this
model, we can answer the two questions raised in the ﬁrst
part of this paper: the block-induced complex structures
built the ﬂare-productive AR 12673 and the X9.3 ﬂare
was triggered by an erupting ﬁlament due to the kink
instability.
