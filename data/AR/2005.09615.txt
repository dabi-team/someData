ABSTRACT

This paper presents the atmospheric characterisation of three large, gaseous planets: WASP-127 b,
WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b. We analysed spectroscopic data obtained with the G141 grism (1.088 -
1.68 µm) of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the
Iraclis pipeline and the TauREx3 retrieval code, both of which are publicly available. For WASP-
127 b, which is the least dense planet discovered so far and is located in the short-period Neptune
desert, our retrieval results found strong water absorption corresponding to an abundance of log(H2O)
−1.05, and absorption compatible with an iron hydride abundance of log(FeH)=−5.25+0.88
= -2.71+0.78
−1.10, with
an extended cloudy atmosphere. We also detected water vapour in the atmospheres of WASP-79 b and
WASP-62 b, with best-ﬁt models indicating the presence of iron hydride, too. We used the Atmospheric
Detectability Index (ADI) as well as Bayesian log evidence to quantify the strength of the detection
and compared our results to the hot Jupiter population study by Tsiaras et al. (2018). While all
the planets studied here are suitable targets for characterisation with upcoming facilities such as the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel, WASP-127 b is of particular interest due to its low

migration.

1. INTRODUCTION

The currently-known exoplanet population displays a
wide range of masses, radii, and orbits. Although many
planets have been detected and it is thought that they
are common in our Galaxy (Howard 2013; Batalha et al.
2013; Cassan et al. 2012; Dressing & Charbonneau 2013;
Wright et al. 2012), our current knowledge of their at-
mospheric characteristics is still very limited. Examin-
ing the atmospheres of exoplanets further unveils their
planetary properties, with their study made possible
by various methods, including transit spectroscopy (e.g.
Tinetti et al. 2007; Swain et al. 2008). Facilities such as
the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Tele-
scope, as well as some ground-based observatories, have
provided constraints on these properties for a limited
number of targets and, in some cases, have identiﬁed
the key molecules present in their atmospheres while
also detecting the presence of clouds and probing their
thermal structure (e.g. Brogi et al. 2012; Majeau et al.
2012; Stevenson et al. 2014; Sing et al. 2016; Fu et al.
2017; Tsiaras et al. 2018; Hoeijmakers et al. 2018; Pin-
has et al. 2019; Tsiaras et al. 2019; Ehrenreich et al.
2020; Edwards et al. 2020a).

This paper presents the analysis of data from Hubble’s
public archive for the exoplanets WASP-127 b (Lam
et al. 2017), WASP-79 b (Smalley et al. 2012) and
WASP-62 b (Hellier et al. 2012). They are all inﬂated,
with low eccentricities and short orbital periods around
bright stars. Table 1 presents the stellar and planetary
parameters for each of these targets.

WASP-127 b is an ideal target for spectroscopic stud-
ies, given its unusually low density (with a super-Jupiter
radius and a sub-Saturn mass). It is located in the short-
period Neptune desert, where it is expected that plan-
ets might not survive photo-evaporation (Owen & Lai
2018; Mazeh et al. 2016). However, photo-evaporation is
strongly case-dependent and this planet receives a rela-
tively low extreme ultraviolet ﬂux (Chen, G. et al. 2018).
Potential explanations for its inﬂation include tidal heat-
ing, enhanced atmospheric opacity, Ohmic heating, and
re-inﬂation by the host star during inward migration
(Leconte et al. 2010; Batygin & Stevenson 2010; Baty-
gin et al. 2011; Rauscher & Menou 2013; Lithwick & Wu
2014). Both WASP-62 b and WASP-79 b are believed to
have an evaporating atmosphere, with mass loss rates
estimated at ≈ 11 g·s−1 (Bourrier et al. 2015). WASP-
79 b, which has a polar orbit, was originally detected

through an aberration in the radial velocity due to the
Rossiter McLaughlin eﬀect (Addison et al. 2013).

All spectral data presented herein were acquired with
the G141 grism (1.088 - 1.68 µm) of the HST/WFC3
camera and details regarding each observation can be
found in Table 2. In Section 2, we detail how the data
were reduced with the Iraclis pipeline (Tsiaras et al.
2016b),
following the approach described by Tsiaras
et al. (2018), and summarised here. In Section 2.3, we
describe the TauREx retrieval code used to analyse the
reduced spectra (Waldmann et al. 2015a,b; Al-Refaie
et al. 2019), along with the initial parameters and priors
used. Our results can be found in Section 3, followed by
a discussion on our ﬁndings and the implications they
hold for future missions, including simulations of data
from Ariel and JWST.

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1. HST Observations

Data reduction and calibration were performed using
Iraclis, software developed in Tsiaras et al. (2016b)
and available on GitHub1; it has been used to extract
HST spectra in multiple studies, including Tsiaras et al.
(2016c, 2018, 2019). We used the Mikulski Archive for
Space Telescopes2 to assess the spectroscopic observa-
tional data of WASP-127 b, WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b
and information about the observations can be found
in Table 2. The WASP-127 b proposal was led by Jes-
sica Spake while David Sing was the PI for the obser-
vations of WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b. Although more
data is available from additional instruments, we have
restricted our study to HST/WFC3 data, in order to
maintain consistency in comparing the analysis of the
planets.

2.2. Data Analysis

The planets in this paper were analysed to be com-
parable to the thirty planets studied in Tsiaras et al.
(2018). We followed the same methodology as sum-
marised below; diﬀerences between our studies are
stated explicitly.

Our analysis began with raw spatially scanned spec-
troscopic images, with data reduction and correction

steps performed in the following order: zero-read sub-
traction; reference pixel correction; non-linearity cor-
rection; dark current subtraction; gain conversion; sky
background subtraction; calibration; ﬂat-ﬁeld correc-
tion; bad pixels and cosmic ray correction.

Following the reduction process, the ﬂux was ex-
tracted from the spatially scanned spectroscopic images
to create the ﬁnal transit light-curves per wavelength
band. We considered one broadband (white) light-curve
covering the whole wavelength range in which the G141
grism is sensitive (1.088 - 1.68 µm) and spectral light-
curves with a resolving power of 70 at 1.4 µm. When
extracting the spectral light-curves, Iraclis accounts
for the geometric distortions induced by the tilt of the
detector in the WFC3 infrared channel. The bands of
the spectral light-curves are selected such that the SNR
is approximately uniform across the planetary spectrum.
We extracted our ﬁnal light-curves from the diﬀerential,
non-destructive reads. Prior to light curve ﬁtting, we
chose to discard the ﬁrst HST orbit of each visit, as
these exhibit much stronger hooks than subsequent or-
bits.

Our white light-curves were ﬁt using literature values
and the only free parameters, other than the coeﬃcients
for Hubble systematics, were the planet-to-star radius

ratio and the transit mid time. This is motivated by the
gaps in the observations, caused by Earth obscuration,
which often means the ingress and egress of the transit
is missed, limiting our ability to reﬁne the semi-major
axis to star radius ratio and the inclination planet’s or-
bit. The limb-darkening coeﬃcients were selected from
the quadratic formula by Claret (2000), using the stel-
lar parameters in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the raw white
light-curve, the detrended white light-curve, and the ﬁt-
ting residuals for WASP-127 b while Figure 2 shows the
ﬁts of spectral light-curves for each wavelength bin. Sim-
ilar plots for WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b are shown in
Figures 3 and 4.

2.3. Atmospheric characterisation

The reduced spectra obtained using Iraclis were there-
after ﬁtted using the publicly available3 Bayesian atmo-
spheric retrieval framework TauREx 3 (Al-Refaie et al.
2019). TauREx uses the nested sampling code Multinest
(Feroz et al. 2009) to explore the likelihood space of at-
mospheric parameters and features highly accurate line
lists from the ExoMol project (Tennyson et al. 2016),

along with those from HITRAN and HITEMP (Roth-
man et al. 1987; Rothman et al. 2010). In our retrieval
analysis, we used 750 live points and an evidence toler-
ance of 0.5. Several molecular opacities have been tested
to model the spectra of the observations; in this publi-
cation, we considered ﬁve trace gases: H2O (Polyan-
sky et al. 2018), CH4 (Yurchenko & Tennyson 2014),
CO(Li et al. 2015), CO2 (Rothman et al. 2010), NH3
(Yurchenko et al. 2011) and FeH (Dulick et al. 2003). In
the wavelength range covered by G141, water vapour is
the dominant spectral feature, but these other molecules
can present detectable signals, particularly FeH (Ten-
nyson & Yurchenko 2018). Clouds are ﬁtted assuming a
grey opacity model.

2.3.1. General setup

In this study we use the plane-parallel approximation
to model the atmospheres, with pressures ranging from
10−2 to 106 Pa, uniformly sampled in log-space with 100
atmospheric layers. We included the Rayleigh scattering
and the collision induced absorption (CIA) of H2–H2 and
H2–He (Abel et al. 2011; Fletcher et al. 2018; Abel et al.
2012). A summary of the ﬁtted retrieval parameters is
given in Table 1. For consistency, the same parameter
bounds have been applied for all three planets. Constant
molecular abundance proﬁles were used, and allowed to
vary freely between 10−12 and 10−1 in volume mixing
ratio. The planetary radius was set to vary in our models
between 0.5 Rref and 1.5 Rref , where Rref the reference
radius from the literature for each planet, as shown in
Table 1. This is assumed to be equivalent to the radius
at 106 Pa pressure.

transmission spectra where, for clarity, an oﬀset has been

ﬁt model plotted. Right: residuals from the ﬁtting with
values for the Chi-squared (χ2), the standard deviation of the
residuals with respect to the photon noise (¯σ) and the auto-
correlation (AC). The mean ¯σ for each of the three planets
is between 1.02 and 1.25 times the photon noise.

The cloud top pressure ranged from 10−2 to 106 Pa,
in log-uniform scale. We consider a cloud top pressure
of 106 Pa to be a cloud-free atmosphere; the grey cloud
model used for this study corresponds to a fully opaque
layer below the cloud top pressure.

An isothermal atmosphere was assumed and the plan-
etary temperature, Tp, set to vary from 400 to 2500 K;
this is to accommodate the wide range in equilibrium
temperatures between our three planets, which are be-
tween 1400 K and 1750 K as shown in Table 1.

2.4. Atmospheric Detectability Index - ADI

For quantifying the detection signiﬁcance of an atmo-
sphere, we use the Atmospheric Detection Index (ADI)
from Tsiaras et al. (2018), positively deﬁned as the

Bayes Factor between the nominal atmospheric model
and the ﬂat-line model (i.e. a model representing a fully
cloudy atmosphere). For the ﬂat line model, the only
free parameters are the planet radius and temperature,
along with the cloud pressure. The nominal model then
includes Rayleigh scattering and the collision induced
absorption of H2–H2 and H2–He, as well as molecular
opacities. If an atmosphere is detected at 3 σ and 5 σ
level, the corresponding ADI will be above 3 and 11,
respectively. An ADI below 3 suggests the atmospheric
detection is not signiﬁcant, indicating the spectral fea-
ture amplitudes are insuﬃcient given the uncertainty of
the data.

To quantify the detection of particular species, we
computed the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of the
Bayesian evidences of diﬀerent models. We follow the
formalism by Kass & Raftery (1995) for model selection
signiﬁcance as well as translate the Bayes factor to the
more traditional σ signiﬁcance nomenclature following
(Benneke & Seager 2012).

2.5. Ephemeris Reﬁnement

Accurate knowledge of exoplanet transit times is fun-
damental for atmospheric studies. To ensure the planets
studied here can be observed in the future, we used our
HST white light curve mid times, along with data from
TESS (Ricker et al. 2014), to update the ephemeris of
each planet. TESS data is publicly available through the
MAST archive and we used the pipeline from Edwards
et al. (2020b) to download, clean and ﬁt the 2 minute
cadence data. WASP-127 b had been studied in Sector
9; WASP-79 b in Sectors 4 and 5; and WASP-62 b in Sec-
tors 1-4 and 6-13. After excluding bad data, we recov-
ered 4, 12 and 60 transits for WASP-127 b, WASP-79 b
and WASP 62b respectively. These were ﬁtted individu-
ally with the planet-to-star radius ratio Rp/Rs, reduced
semi-major axis (a/Rs), inclination (i) and transit mid
time (Tmid) as free parameters. Finally, we ﬁtted a lin-
ear period (P) to these mid times and selected the up-
dated transit mid time (T0) such that the co-variance
between T0 and P was minimised. Mid times were con-
verted to BJDT DB using the tool from Eastman et al.
(2010).

3. RESULTS

Each planet’s retrieval produced results consistent
with the signiﬁcant presence of water vapour, with
opaque clouds in two of the three planets. While we
did attempt to retrieve the carbon-based molecules, CO,
CO2, and CH4, only their upper value could be con-
strained as they lack strong absorption features in the
G141 wavelength range. In each case our best-ﬁt solu-

tion also indicates the presence of FeH, with abundances
of log(FeH) between -3.04 and -5.25.

The relatively high water abundances retrieved (10−2-
10−3) for these three planets can be suggestive of metal-
licities in the super-solar regime (Madhusudhan 2012;
Pinhas et al. 2018; Charnay et al. 2018). However, there
are known degeneracies between the the cloud pres-
sure, 106 Pa radius and water abundance retrieved from
WFC3 data (Griﬃth 2014; Heng & Kitzmann 2017).
Additionally, due to the restrictions of the WFC3 wave-
length ranges, these observations are not generally sen-
sitive to the main carbon bearing species and arguments

of high metallicities are usually based on retrieved water
abundances alone, assuming that half of the oxygen is in
H2O as expected for a solar C/O ratio at high tempera-
tures (Madhusudhan 2012). Hence, observations cover-
ing longer wavelength ranges are needed to further con-
strain the C/O ratios of these planets, to fully under-
stand their metallicity.

Our ﬁndings are shown in Table 3, with Figure 5 show-
casing all three retrieved spectra with the corresponding
contributions for each opacity source in Figure 6. For
WASP-127 b, the posteriors are shown in Figure 7, with
equivalent results for WASP-79 b in Figure 8 for WASP-
62 b in Figure 9.

3.1. WASP-127 b

As expected given the low density, we retrieved a
statistically signiﬁcant atmosphere around WASP-127 b
with a strong detection of water and opaque clouds. The
retrieved radius is 1.16+0.04
−0.04 RJ at a pressure of 10 bar,
which is smaller than stated in previous studies (1.37
RJ , Chen, G. et al. (2018)). However, our analysis is
best ﬁt with high altitude opaque clouds (log(Pclouds) =
1.85+0.97
−0.66 Pa), which corresponds to approximately 1.37
RJ , thus explaining this diﬀerence between the retrieved
radius and the radius in the literature.

In terms of chemistry, our best ﬁt solution indicates
signiﬁcant amounts of water at log(H2O)= -2.71+0.78
−1.05,
and constraints on FeH. FeH produces the ﬂat absorp-
tion between 1.2 and 1.3 µm, whilst deepening the slope
in the longer wavelengths (around 1.5 - 1.6 µm). We
also note a correlation between the amount of these two
molecules, the radius and the cloud pressure. For less
H2O and FeH, the model requires deeper clouds, but a
higher base planet radius. In particular, the abundance
of FeH can vary from 10−4 to 10−7, depending the com-
plementary contribution of clouds.

The posteriors for FeH are, however, always distinct;
clouds cannot be used to completely replace the ad-
ditional visible absorption provided by FeH. A lower
metallicity, and larger radius, could be consistent with
current data, but is not the best-ﬁt solution. Given the
posterior distribution, we don’t ﬁnd a clear correlation
between the radius and the water abundance.

3.2. WASP-79 b

For WASP-79 b, we get very similar results to those
of WASP-127 b, with the exception of the cloud deck.
Following our baseline approach, we ﬁnd a large abun-
dance of water at log(H2O)= -2.43+0.57
−0.76 and well deﬁned
constraints on the abundance of FeH with log(FeH)=
-4.42+0.91
−1.18. The clouds, however, do not impact the

pressure (Pclouds >103 Pa). This means that either the
planet possesses a clear atmosphere, or that the clouds

are located below the visible pressure, at which the at-
mosphere is opaque due to molecular or collision in-
duced absorption. We do not detect signatures of CH4,
CO, or CO2. The retrieved temperature of ∼1000 K is
lower than the calculated equilibrium temperature for
this type of planet; this was also found in Sotzen et al.
(2019) and is discussed further in Section 4.

3.3. WASP-62 b

−1.27 and log(FeH)=-3.04+2.18

The recovered spectrum of WASP-62 b was ﬂatter
than the two other planets. However, we found that
the data was best explained by the presence of H2O and
FeH and, for this retrieval, the recovered abundances are
log(H2O)=-2.03+0.52
−2.27. These
results stem from detections in the lower-wavelength
spectrum, below 1.5 µm, which guides the retrieval to-
wards non-fully opaque sources, such as clouds and high-
radius solutions. Again, the retrieved temperature is
lower than the expected 1475 K equilibrium tempera-
ture, which is indicative of a large day-night tempera-
ture contrast and/or eﬃcient cooling mechanisms. Our
analysis indicates that clouds are likely to be present,
but the quality of our data means that we cannot com-
pletely rule out a clear atmosphere.

The retrieved abundances are very high, but we note
that the posteriors allow for a wide range of abundances
and present interesting correlations; such as, the lower
the abundance of H2O and FeH are, the higher in the
atmosphere the clouds are located. There is also a nega-
tive correlation between the molecular abundances and
the temperature and, from the posterior distributions,
we see that the data is consistent with abundances of
order of 10−4 in H2O and FeH.

Finally, we note that given the low spectral variations
in this spectrum, the retrieval may lack a scale height
constraint, which would provide a relevant baseline in
predicting the molecular abundances and temperature
more accurately.

3.4. Ephemeris Reﬁnement

We found that the observed HST and TESS tran-
sits were consistent with literature ephemeris within 1σ.
Nevertheless, we reﬁned the period and reference mid
transit time for each planet. The updated ephemeris
is given in Table 3 while the ﬁtting for the TESS data
can be seen in the ﬁgures of the appendix. The transit
depth and errors of the WFC3 for the 3 planets are pre-
sented in Table 4. The observed minus calculated plots
are given in Figure 10 and all transit mid times used
for the ﬁtting are listed in two Tables in the Appendix.
These have been uploaded to ExoClock4, an initiative
to ensure transiting planets are regularly followed-up,
keeping their ephemeris up-to-date for the ESA Ariel
mission (Tinetti et al. 2018).

4. DISCUSSION

Initially our baseline model did not include FeH, but
these models struggled to ﬁt the data, forcing solutions
to lower temperatures and nonphysical values in order to
account for the opacity sources at shorter wavelengths
with a grey cloud deck. FeH has strong absorption fea-
tures in the visible and near-infrared, and can be ex-
pected at the temperatures of these planets (Tennyson
& Yurchenko 2018; Madhusudhan et al. 2016); hence

we propose it as the possible absorber to suit our spec-
tral features and explore our justiﬁcations for FeH over
molecules with similar spectral signatures, such as TiO
or VO, in this discussion. FeH was not included in the
analysis of Tsiaras et al. (2018) and thus, for the hotter
planets in that study, retrievals with FeH may alter the
retrieved atmospheric characteristics.

Theoretical equilibrium chemistry models predict FeH
(Sharp & Burrows 2007; Woitke et al. 2018) to be stable

in the gas phase at the temperatures and pressures con-
sistent with the planetary atmospheres considered here.
FeH has previously been observed in L and M brown
dwarfs at 1800 K (Visscher et al. 2010).
In cooler T
dwarfs, it has been shown to appear where brown dwarfs
have temperatures below 1350 K (Burgasser et al. 2002),
with some additional studies (Cushing et al. 2008) con-
ﬁrming FeH detection in dwarfs with temperatures of
1000 K. The latter of these detections is at temperatures

comparable to the retrieved temperatures the planets
here.

A recent study from Ehrenreich et al. (2020) found
atomic iron (Fe) in the day-side of the planet WASP-
76 b, and not in the terminator, concluding that Fe is
condensing on the night-side, then falling into deeper
layers of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the results in
Pluriel et al. (2020) and Caldas et al. (2019) have inves-
tigated how the 3D structure of the atmosphere biases

the abundances retrieved with typical retrieval codes,
since there is a chemical dichotomy between the day-
and night-side that is not considered in a 1D treatment
of transit geometry.

We therefore identify three possible scenarios for the

detection of FeH in these planets:

• FeH is orginating from the day-side where the tem-
perature is much higher, and leaks in the night-

processes (Heng et al. 2011).

et al. 2019; Pluriel et al. 2020).

• Atmospheric retrieval studies involve temperature
bias due to 3D eﬀects, and we retrieve indeed a
cooler temperature than expected; we discuss this
in Section 4.1.

• A 3D eﬀect is in play and we retrieve the FeH in
the day-side inﬂated region of the limb (Caldas

Table 5 contains the log evidence of several retrievals
for each planet.
In all cases, the addition of FeH in-
creases the goodness of ﬁt, while also raising the re-
trieved temperature. We note that all models included
clouds. By comparing the log evidence of the models
with only H2O and the models with H2O and FeH, we

cates strong to decisive evidence in favour of models
containing FeH (Kass & Raftery 1995; Benneke & Sea-
ger 2012; Changeat et al. 2019).

While we postulate that our evidence holds for FeH,
it is possible that we detect another, yet unidentiﬁed
opacity source with absorption characteristics similar to
those of FeH over the WFC3 passband. For instance,
similar absorption features can be produced with metal
oxides such as TiO, VO and YO. However, we do not
expect the presence of these molecules in these plan-
ets due to the planets’ low equilibrium temperatures.
TiO and VO have condensation temperatures of over
∼2000K (Lodders 2002; Hubeny et al. 2003; Fortney
et al. 2008); the highest equilibrium temperature fea-
tured of these three planets is WASP-79b’s 1716K, as
referenced in Table 1, thus rendering it less likely that
the spectral features are due to TiO and VO compared
to FeH. Ultimately, this further exempliﬁes the need for
longer wavelength coverage with JWST or Ariel to con-
ﬁrm the nature of observed absorption in the future.

Retrieved Temperature [K] Equilibrium Temperature [K]

For each planet, we have calculated the ADI and found
signiﬁcant evidence of atmospheric features for all three.
Given the water detection on all three planets, our re-
sults support the conclusions drawn by Tsiaras et al.
(2018); inﬂated, hot Jupiter-like planets do not neces-
sarily destroy water in their upper atmospheres.

4.1. Retrieved temperature

For the three planets considered, the temperature re-
trieved is notably lower than the equilibrium tempera-
ture. In Figure 11, we present a plot analysing the tem-
peratures retrieved for other planets, particularly giving
attention to the population paper we based our study
on, Tsiaras et al. (2018).
Indeed, retrieved tempera-
tures are typically lower than the equilibrium ones, and
we derived a best ﬁt of this.

One of the key assumptions leading to this eﬀect
is that the equilibrium temperature is usually calcu-
lated for the planet day-side and considering a planetary
albedo of zero. Considering an albedo greater than zero
necessarily implies a loss of energy, and therefore a lower
equilibrium temperature.

Furthermore, the region probed during transit eclipse
observations is the terminator region: a mix between
the day- and the night-side. The temperature diﬀerence
observed may indicate a bias in the retrievals, which
consider exclusively a 1D geometry of the atmospheres.
This bias has been pointed out by several studies, espe-
cially Caldas et al. (2019); MacDonald et al. (2020) and
Pluriel et al. (2020).

Figure 11. Correlation between the retrieved temperature
and the equilibrium temperature for the planets studied in
Tsiaras et al. (2018). We observe a global trend that the re-
trieved temperature is lower than the calculated equilibrium
temperature, and derived a best-ﬁt for this trend. WASP-
127b, WASP-79b and WASP-62b have been added; we can
see that they follow this trend as well.

4.2. WASP-127 b

We used ExoREM (Exoplanet Radiative-convective
Equilibrium Model; Baudino et al. (2015); Charnay
et al. (2018)), a self-consistent simulation software for
brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets, to calculate the
mean temperature proﬁle and the expected abundances
of WASP-127 b assuming a solar composition.

14

Figure 12. [

Contribution function] Typical contribution function of our
retrievals. We can see the eﬀect of the H2O lines. The raise
in sensitivity at ≈ 104 Pa is due to the opaque cloud.

The model suggests signiﬁcant abundances of H2O,
CO and Na; though, as stated previously, the WFC3
coverage means our data set is only sensitive to H2O.

From Figure 12, we can see that our retrieval is sen-
sitive at pressures between ≈ 104 and 102 Pa. Figure
13 indicates the retrieved abundances of WASP-127 b
are compatible with a solar composition in this pressure
range. The mean retrieved abundance of FeH is higher
than expected values; however, the error spans three or-
ders of magnitude, allowing for more physical solutions,
as discussed at the beginning of this section.

As displayed in Figure 14, the retrieved tempera-
ture of WASP-127 b is compatible with the calculated
mean temperature proﬁle within our pressure sensitiv-
ity range. We can also see that the calculated tempera-
ture proﬁle crosses the condensation curves of MnS and
Cr between 104 and 103 Pa. We could therefore expect
clouds composed of these species to form at these pres-
sures.

Low and high resolution spectra of WASP-127 b have
been collected with ground-based instruments. Palle
et al. (2017) obtained low resolution spectroscopy with
the Andalucia Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera
(ALFOSC) spectrograph mounted on the Nordic Opti-
cal Telescope (NOT), covering the spectral range 0.45 -
0.85 µm. A slope was detected in the optical wavelength
spectrum, interpreted as Rayleigh scattering and poten-
tially Na. They also attribute the trend to TiO/VO with
low signiﬁcance. Chen, G. et al. (2018) observed with
the OSIRIS spectrograph, mounted on the Gran Tele-
scopio Canarias (GTC) telescope, covering the range

by Exo-REM, assuming chemical non-equilibrium for C, N
and O bearing species, an eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 108
cm2.s−1, and a metallicity of 3 times solar (Lodders 2019).
We have included TiO and VO to the Exo-REM run but
found their predicted abundances to be negligible (< 10−14).

Spitzer data from IRAC 1 and 2, also concluded that

in a best-ﬁt solution detecting H2O, CO2, Na and K;

Hence, our independent data reduction and analysis
of the water content in the atmosphere of WASP-127 b
is consistent with these studies. We do not attempt a
joint retrieval with this data due to the potential in-
compatibility between the data sets from diﬀerent in-
struments as highlighted in Yip et al. (2019). Given
that the planet lies within the short-period Neptunian
desert and has large atmospheric features, it will be an
intriguing target for further characterisation.

4.3. WASP-79 b

Sotzen et al. (2019) utilised the same WFC3 data
set, along with observations from ground-based facil-
ities, TESS and Spitzer, to study the atmosphere of
WASP-79 b. Their retrieval results indicates the pres-
ence of H2O, Na and FeH. Our retrieved water abun-
dance is consistent with that from Sotzen et al. (2019);
(2.20 <log(H2O) <1.55).

In our retrievals without FeH as an opacity source,
our solution is driven to low temperatures; Sotzen et al.
(2019) encountered a similar predicament when at-
tempting to ﬁt a chemical equilibrium model to the
data. Here, by adding FeH as a retrieval parameter, our
recovered temperature increases to 996 K+249
−228, which
more readily agrees with what is expected for the ter-
minator region.

While the temperature is still cooler than expected, we
note the degeneracy with the 10 bar radius. Our analy-
sis of purely the HST/WFC3 data also favours the pres-
ence of H2O and FeH. Na does not have features within
the WFC3 spectral range, and we do not attempt the
addition of other data for the aforementioned reasons.

4.4. WASP-62 b

WASP-62 b has demonstrably similar bulk charac-
teristics to HD 209458 b; both planets have roughly
the same radius and eﬀective temperature, although
HD 209458 b is ≈ 20% more massive than WASP-62 b
(Bonomo et al. 2017). Given their similarities, we may
expect them to exhibit a similar atmospheric chemistry
and structure. HD 209458b has been extensively anal-
ysed in the literature, with 3D simulations (Showman
et al. 2009) and cloud analysis (Sing et al. 2016), making
it ideal to interpret the results on WASP-62 b. We ob-
serve a cloud deck located at ≈ 2.5 × 103 Pa. This cloud
deck could be explained by the condensation of MgSiO3
in the atmosphere, as was the case with HD 209458 b
(Sing et al. 2016).

Using the models of Showman et al. (2009) and Caldas
et al. (2019), we may expect the temperature at the ter-

15

minator to be close to ≈ 1350 K. This is somewhat hot-
ter than the 891+211
−164 K retrieved in our standard setup
(2.2σ). However, as seen in the posterior plot in Figure
9, there is a strong correlation between the tempera-
ture, the planet radius and the cloud pressure; so the
data remains consistent with the expected temperature.

4.5. Future Characterisation

Upcoming ground and space-based telescopes such
as the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT,
Brandl et al. 2018), the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT,
Skidmore et al. 2018), the Giant Magellan Telescope
(GMT, Fanson et al. 2018), the James Webb Space Tele-
scope (JWST, Greene et al. 2016)), Twinkle (Edwards
et al. 2018) and Ariel (Tinetti et al. 2018) will char-
acterise the atmospheres of a large population of exo-
planets via transit and eclipse spectroscopy at visible
and infrared wavelengths. These missions will move the
exoplanet ﬁeld from an era of detection into one of char-
acterisation, allowing for the identiﬁcation of the molec-
ular species present and their chemical proﬁle, insights
into the atmospheric temperature proﬁle and the detec-
tion and characterisation of clouds (e.g. Rocchetto et al.
2016; Rodler 2018; Changeat et al. 2019).

Ariel has been selected as ESA’s M4 mission adop-
tion candidate for launch in 2028 and is designed for the
characterisation of a large and diverse population of exo-
planetary atmospheres to provide insights into planetary
formation and evolution within our Galaxy. Ariel will
provide simultaneous photometry and spectroscopy over
0.5 - 7.8 µm. Each of the planets studied here is an excel-
lent target for atmospheric studies with Ariel (Edwards
et al. 2019) and we use ArielRad (Mugnai et al. 2020) to
simulate observations of this forthcoming mission. For
each of the planets we take the best-ﬁt solution from
the Hubble WFC3 analysis to model Ariel observations
at the native resolution of its instruments. Figure 15
highlights the increased wavelength coverage and data
quality that will be achieved with Ariel, allowing for a
deeper understanding of each of these worlds. WASP-
79 b is part of the JWST Early release Science (ERS)
program and will be observed by JWST with several dif-
ferent instruments (Bean et al. 2018). Here we simulate
JWST observations for these planets, assuming NIRISS
GR700XD and NIRSpec G395H are used. Again, the in-
crease in data quality is easily discernible and, although
it is not a dedicated exoplanet mission, JWST promises
to provide exquisite data for atmospheric characterisa-
tion.

5. CONCLUSION

We have presented the analysis of data from Hub-
ble’s WFC3 G141 grism for three planets. By using

Figure 15. Simulated Ariel and JWST observations of the best-ﬁt solutions retrieved in this work. For Ariel, WASP-127 b is
for a single observation while WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b have 3 stacked transits each. The transit depths have been oﬀset to
show the diﬀerence in the size of the atmospheric features between the planets. We note that, according to the work of Edwards
et al. (2019), WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b may be more suited to study with Ariel via emission spectroscopy. JWST simulations
have been performed using ExoWebb (Edwards et al. 2020) for a single transit with NIRISS GR700XD as well as an observation
with NIRSpec G395H.

the Iraclis pipeline and ﬁtting the resultant spectra
with TauREx, we have characterised the atmospheres
of WASP-127 b, WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b, recovering
best ﬁt models which favour the presence of H2O and
FeH in each case. This was performed during the ARES
Summer School, using software and data publicly avail-
able to the community in order to allow for reproducible
results.

The properties of WASP-127 b, particularly its ex-
tended atmosphere with clouds and large spectral fea-
tures; the resultant high atmospheric detectability; and

its unusually low density; make it an ideal target for
further characterisation with the next generation of fa-
cilities. Large spectral features were also detected in
WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b, with clouds in the atmo-
sphere of the latter.

None of the three planets studied have strong features
in their spectra that can be linked to NH3, CH4, CO, or
CO2. This is expected, given their spectroscopic lines
do not have major bands in this wavelength range com-
pared to the H2O and FeH lines and higher quality data,
with a broader spectral coverage, is required to improve

constraints on the atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless,
studying the atmospheric composition of these planets
has extended the catalogue of hot Jupiters studied with
WFC3 from those by Tsiaras et al. (2018). The ADI
introduced therein has been utilised eﬀectively in this
paper to estimate the signiﬁcance of these atmospheric
observations. This was done in order to unify the sta-
tistical results between our study and that of further
populations studies, which remain fundamental tools in
understanding the nature and evolutionary history of
planets.

This work was realised as part of ARES, the Ariel
Retrieval Exoplanet School, in Biarritz in 2019. The
school was organised by Jean-Philippe Beaulieu with
the ﬁnancial support of CNES. The publicly available
observations presented here were taken as part of pro-
posals 14619 and 14767, led by Jessica Spake and David
Sing respectively. These were obtained from the Hubble
Archive which is part of the Mikulski Archive for Space
Telescopes. We are thankful to those who operate this
archive, and public nature of which increases scientiﬁc
productivity and accessibility (Peek et al. 2019).
