We study the contribution to the primordial curvature perturbation on observational scales gen-
erated by the reheating ﬁeld in massless preheating. To do so we use lattice simulations and a recent
extension to the δN formalism. The work demonstrates the functionality of these techniques for
calculating the observational signatures of models in which non-perturbative reheating involves a
light scalar ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Inﬂation is the favoured theory for the production
of primordial perturbations which seed anisotropies ob-
served in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
These perturbations are constrained to be close to scale
invariant and close to Gaussian [1, 2], with tight bounds
on the spectral index, the tensor to scalar ratio, and
the local non-Gaussianity parameter f loc
It is there-
nl .
fore imperative that we are able to accurately calculate
the statistics of perturbations produced by diﬀerent mod-
els of the early universe to confront them with obser-
vations. For simple models the procedure to do this is
well understood, but if more than one ﬁeld is light at
the end of inﬂation, perturbations produced by inﬂation
evolve during the reheating phase which follows. This
is both a problem and potentially an opportunity, since
it makes model predictions sensitive to this complicated
and poorly constrained phase of evolution. In this paper,
for the ﬁrst time we calculate the statistics of the curva-
ture perturbation on observational scales directly using
lattice simulations of reheating.

During reheating, particles may be produced rapidly
due to non-perturbative reheating processes, often called
preheating [3] [4] [5] [6]. If particles are produced in a
ﬁeld that is light during inﬂation, this process can alter
the statistics of the primordial curvature perturbation ζ
over observable scales [7, 8]. This is because the rate of
particle production is sensitive to the initial conditions of
the reheating ﬁeld, which are modulated over such scales.
The simplest example is massless preheating, in which
particles are produced by parametric resonance of a light
reheating ﬁeld, and which serves as a testing ground of
methods to calculate the statistics of ζ after inﬂation. It
is the focus of this paper.

There are two main problems for calculating ζ after
massless preheating. First, as a non-perturbative process

involving the excitation of the inhomogeneous subhorizon
modes of the ﬁelds, it must be studied using lattice sim-
ulations. Second, since these simulations typically only
capture the dynamics of a patch of the universe expo-
nentially smaller than observable universe, and because
the average evolution of such a patch can be very sen-
sitive to initial conditions in a highly non-linear way,
widely used methods such as the standard δN formal-
ism cannot be used without modiﬁcation. These issues
have been discussed at length in a number of publications
[7–10][11][12]. In our own earlier work on the issue [13],
we discussed the use of a non-perturbative approach to
δN to address these issues, which is described below. In
this current work, we implement this method to calculate
the statistics of ζ after massless preheating directly from
lattice simulations.

II. NON-PERTURBATIVE δN FORMALISM

The δN formalism [14–18] employs the separate uni-
verse assumption to calculate the observable statistical
properties of ζ produced by scalar ﬁeld models of the
early universe. It typically assumes that the number of
e-folds, N , undergone by a patch of the universe coarse-
grained on observable scales is a function of the ﬁeld’s
initial conditions coarse-grained on those scales, and that
this function can be well described by the leading terms
in a Taylor expansion. This is used to relate the statis-
tics of ﬁeld perturbations, at some initial time on a ﬂat
hypersurface, to the statistics of ζ at some ﬁnal time.

In [13], we discussed how to proceed if the evolution of
a given patch of the universe is highly sensitive to initial
conditions and a Taylor expansion of the N function is
not a good approximation, as is the case for massless pre-
heating. This begins with the deﬁnition of the ensemble
average of any n-point correlation function in real space.
By working in real space there is no implicit assumption
about coarse-graining at the outset and the method can
therefore utilise simulations of only small regions of the
universe as long as they do not interact with one an-
other, and hence obey the separate universe assumption.
In principle the full n-point function can be evaluated

 
 
 
 
 
 
directly, but this is often challenging to do.

Alternatively, one can employ an expansion which does
not assume a Taylor expansion of the e-fold function, but
instead a Taylor expansion in the correlation between the
ﬁeld’s value at separated spatial positions
[12, 13, 19].
We showed [13] that this approach leads to expressions
for the correlation functions of ζ which take the same
form as those of the usual δN formalism but with non-
perturbative δN coeﬃcients instead of the usual deriva-
tives of N . We observed that in many cases our method
showed noticeable improvement over standard δN expan-
sion, and argued that it is ideally suited to use with
lattice simulations, but we also showed that even this
improved expansion can break down, and that whether
this happens needs to be examined on a case by case ba-
sis. Our method is broadly equivalent to the results of
Suyama and Yokoyama [12], where massless preheating
was also analysed, but where only an analytical approx-
imation to the results of lattice simulations was used.

In the present work we therefore implement the non-
perturbative δN formalism together with lattice simu-
lations to directly study massless preheating. Since we
are primarily interested in the contribution to ζ from the
reheating ﬁeld, we will assume this ﬁeld is uncorrelated
to the inﬂaton before the start of the lattice simulations,
and will therefore employ the non-perturbative expan-
sion formalism including only one ﬁeld. In this case the
contribution to the two point function of ζ from this ﬁeld,
denoted χ, at leading and sub-leading order in the corre-
lation expansion is given explicitly by

(cid:104)ζ(x1)ζ(x2)(cid:105) = ˜N 2

, ˜Nχχ =

(cid:104)δχ2(N (χ) − ¯N )(cid:105)
(cid:104)δχ2(cid:105)2

In these expressions for the coeﬃcients, the angle brack-
ets denote an ensemble average with χ drawn from a
single variate Gaussian distribution with mean value ¯χ
and variance Σ = (cid:104)δχ(x)δχ(x)(cid:105), and Σ(r12) is the two
point function of ﬁeld perturbations at separated spatial
positions, Σ(r12) = (cid:104)δχ(x1)δχ(x2)(cid:105). This is evaluated
at the initial time before reheating, while the two point
function of ζ is evaluated at the ﬁnal time after reheating.
We use the sub-leading term above as a necessary test
of the validity of the expansion, and assume that only
in cases where the sub-leading term is sub-dominant can
we trust our expansion method to calculate Ppre with
reasonable accuracy.

We also calculate the local non-Gaussianity using the
leading order expression for the three point function of ζ
in the correlation expansion

where φ is the inﬂaton ﬁeld and χ the reheating ﬁeld,
with dimensionless coupling constants g and λ. The ﬁrst
term in Eq. (4) drives inﬂation while the second term is
responsible for particle creation by parametric resonance
after inﬂation ends, when oscillations of the inﬂaton lead
to an oscillating mass for the χ ﬁeld. For small coupling
ratios , g2/λ, required to excite the ﬁrst resonance band
3λφ
of the system, the masses of the two ﬁelds, mφ =
and mχ = gφ, are comparable during inﬂation, and hence
the χ ﬁeld is light.
This model

is unlikely to be compatible with cur-
rent observations, but still serves as a convenient test-
ing ground for our methods.
It is conformally invari-
ant meaning that the expansion of the universe can be
re-scaled away simplifying lattice simulations. During
inﬂation, χ is approximately zero and the behaviour of
the model is the same as the standard single ﬁeld λ
4 φ4
chaotic inﬂation model. We can therefore estimate the
value of the φ ﬁeld when inﬂation ends by assuming only
φ drives inﬂation and setting the ﬁrst slow-roll parameter
(cid:15)v = 1

pl(V,φ/V )2 to 1. We obtain φend ≈ 2.83Mpl.

A. Expressions for Pinf and Ppre

We now begin the process of calculating the impact of
reheating on ζ using the formalism outlined above. First
let us note that we can immediately estimate the contri-
bution to ζ from the inﬂaton, φ, under our assumption
that it is uncorrelated to the reheating ﬁeld. Assum-
ing the observational pivot scale corresponds to modes
which crossed the horizon 55 e-folds before the end of
inﬂation, the ﬁeld value corresponding to this scale is
φ(cid:63) ≈ 21.17Mpl . This value can then be employed in the
standard expression for the power spectrum of ζ

On the other hand, to calculate the contribution of the
χ ﬁeld we must employ the non-perturbative δN formal-
ism. The eﬀective mass of the χ ﬁeld is gφ, and we must
begin the δN formalism before this ﬁeld becomes heavy.
We therefore set initial conditions for χ and its statis-
tics at the time just before χ becomes massive, i.e., when
g2φ2
ini ∼ 1. This is shortly before the end of inﬂa-
tion. At this point we assume again that χ can be taken
to be a spectator ﬁeld uncoupled to the inﬂaton, and
therefore has a variance within our observable universe
about some background value, ¯χ, of approximately

One then ﬁnds the amplitude of power spectrum of ζ

(7)

We recall that if our expansion is a good approximation,
the k dependence of the spectrum is inherited from the
spectrum of χ ﬂuctuations at the initial time, which we
take to be close to scale invariant. The value of ¯χ is
determined by the behaviour of the system prior to the
observable number of e-folds, and for the purpose of our
study we take it to be a free parameter, with the restric-
tion that it must be much greater than the variance of χ
for consistency. To evaluate ˜Nχ and ˜Nχχ using Eq. (2)
requires the use of lattice simulations which we now dis-
cuss.

B. Simulations

The δN formalism requires that we record the number
of e-folds that occur between given initial conditions and
some ﬁnal value for the density of the universe ρend after
reheating has occurred and the system has become adia-
batic. In the case of preheating, this has to be done using
lattice ﬁeld theory simulations. This has been done for
massless preheating in Refs. [7, 8, 10].

In this study, in contrast with previous works, we eval-
uate ˜Nχ and ˜Nχχ directly, rather than using some pre-
generated or approximated N (χ) function. To do so we
use the HLattice code [23] to simulate small patches of
the universe (of order the horizon size at the end of in-
ﬂation) from the end of inﬂation until after preheating,
and employ a Monte Carlo approach to calculate ˜Nχ and
˜Nχχ. We describe this process in more detail below. We
choose HLattice because its symplectic integrator allows
for an extremely accurate calculation of the number of e-
folds. It has previously been used to calculate the change
in e-folds due to reheating in Ref. [10].

1. Monte Carlo Method

After ﬁxing the parameters of the massless preheating
potential, we calculate the energy scale and the value of φ
at the time at which χ becomes massive. At this time the
value of the χ ﬁeld is drawn from a Gaussian distribution
with mean value ¯χ, and variance given by Eq. (6). As dis-
cussed above the mean value, ¯χ, can be treated as a free
parameter provided it is much greater than the variance.
Using these values of φ and χ, HLattice then evolves the
background scalar ﬁeld equations until the end of inﬂa-
tion before beginning a lattice simulation. For the lattice
simulation, HLattice treats the initial homogeneous ﬁeld
values as external inputs and takes the average value of
the ﬁelds in the lattice patch to be given by the back-
ground scalar ﬁeld values at the end of inﬂation. The

3

ﬁelds are also given an inhomogeneous (over the lattice)
random Gaussian vacuum ﬂuctuations which average to
zero.

We modify Hlattice to stop the simulation once some
ﬁnal value of the density ρ = ρend has been passed. We
choose a value more than 5 e-folds after inﬂation ends.
Finally, we use a ﬁtting function to calculate log a as a
function of log ρ over a short range around ρend and use
this ﬁt to calculate an accurate value for N at ρend. One
issue we ﬁnd, as was also reported in Bond et al. [10], is
that since reheating is not fully complete after preheat-
ing, the equation of state ω = p/ρ oscillates around the
radiation dominated value of 1/3 after preheating, indi-
cating that the system is not yet fully radiation domi-
nated and adiabatic. If the system were to be adiabatic,
the diﬀerence in N between two diﬀerent patches with
diﬀerent initial conditions and measured at the same suc-
cessive values of ρ would become a constant (i.e., ζ would
become conserved). Instead we ﬁnd that this quantity is
In order to remedy this problem we follow
oscillating.
[10] and average the result over many oscillations. This
is then taken to be our Nend, and we use this value of N
to evaluate the quantity inside the angle brackets on the
right hand side of Eq. (2). By repeatedly drawing new
values of χ, and repeating the procedure, we can calculate
the averages in Eq. (2). The answer should converge as
the number of draws increases. We ﬁnd this does indeed
occur with O(104) draws needed, and we use this number
to generate our results. When we come to present our re-
sults we further use resampling to estimate their error.
Due to the large number of runs required, we run our
simulations on Queen Mary’s Apocrita HPC facility [24].
For our simulations, we choose a resolution of 323 with
comoving box size 20/H, and choose the LATTICEEASY
discretization scheme within HLattice, which is suitable
because we are ignoring metric perturbations (for more
details, see [23]).

2. Checks

To verify the code is working as intended before gen-
erating results for our study, we ﬁrst reproduced the plot
given in [10], where Nend was plotted against χ ﬁxed at
the end of inﬂation (not at a time just before χ becomes
massive like we will consider for our purposes – a simi-
lar plot for the initial conditions we use can be seen in
Fig. 1). The plot is highly featured with many spikes
generated by the chaotic behaviour of the system, and
shows clearly the necessity of using the non-perturbative
δN method. Moreover, we check that our results are
insensitive to the period over which we average the os-
cillations caused by the oscillating equation of state at
the end of pre-heating. Finally, we also check that N is
eﬀectively unchanged when χini is varied for values of the
coupling ratio g2/λ for which the homogeneous mode is
outside a resonance band of the system. We do this for
g2/λ = 1 and 3.

4

function looks for λ = 10−14. The three coloured lines
superimposed on the plot are centred on three of our
choices for ¯χ, and indicate the 3σ range around this value.
Fig. 2 indicates the results are highly sensitive to the
initial ¯χ, and this can be understood by considering Fig. 1
which shows that the form of the N functions sampled
when drawing χ from a Gaussian distribution changes
dramatically depending on the value of ¯χ.

As we have described, the method we have outlined
relies on an expansion in the probability distribution for
ﬁeld values at separated positions in real space. The cri-
terion we use for the validity of the expansion requires
that the leading term in Eq. (1) is dominant over the
sub-leading one. This criterion is scale dependent and
gets worse for shorter scales. Here, we consider the cri-
terion for scales which exited 5 e-folds after the largest
observable scale exits the horizon, which roughly corre-
sponds to the shortest scale observed on the CMB. The
power spectrum resulting from the sub-leading term on
this scale is given by the dashed line in Fig. 2 (see for ex-
ample Ref. [25] for a calculation of the power spectrum
associated with this term). We ﬁnd that the expansion
is valid for most of the parameter range we study, but
breaks down in the regions on the plot where the magni-
tude of the power spectrum as calculated using the lead-
ing term drops towards zero. These regions are also ac-
companied by large looking error bars on our logarithmic
plots. In these regions, producing more accurate results
would require the fully non-perturbative formulae for Pζ,
as described (and performed) in Ref. [13].

The contribution to the curvature perturbation ζ from
preheating is sub-dominant compared with the inﬂaton
contribution Pinf , and therefore not observable in the
spectrum. This is similar to the results of [12], though we
ﬁnd that the preheating ﬁeld’s contribution is at least an
order of magnitude larger than that calculated there – re-
inforcing the importance of working directly with lattice
simulations. However, because the inﬂaton contribution
is highly Gaussian, it is interesting to see whether the pre-
heating contribution could be observed through its non-
Gaussianity. To do this, we calculate the conventional
non-Gaussianity parameter fNL from the expression

fNL ≈

where we have assumed that ﬁeld ﬂuctuations before re-
heating are Gaussian, and the inﬂationary contribution
to ζ is Gaussian. The results are presented in Fig. 3.
We can see that although fNL is generally small, it be-
comes signiﬁcantly larger than typical single ﬁeld value
for certain values of ¯χ, making it potentially observable.
This suggests that it may also be possible to achieve an
observable contribution to fNL in more realistic models.

FIG. 1: The value of δN for λ = 10−14, and for diﬀerent
initial ﬁeld values, χini, in Planck units. The three coloured
lines (red, blue and magenta) span the range of values that
χini takes, i.e., ¯χi±3σ for ¯χ1 = 5×10−6Mpl, ¯χ2 = 6×10−6Mpl
and ¯χ3 = 7 × 10−6Mpl. Note that here, our χini is the value
the ﬁeld takes just before it becomes massive.

C. Results

We now present some results for a number of diﬀer-
ent parameter choices, presenting both the inﬂationary
contribution and the contribution from preheating under
the assumptions made above.

1. Case 1 : λ = 1.8 × 10−13

We begin by taking λ = 1.8 × 10−13, with g2/λ = 2.
This value of λ leads to a contribution to the power spec-
trum of Pinf = 2.10 × 10−9 from the inﬂaton ﬁeld, in
agreement with observations. The model is still not a
realistic theory of inﬂation because the predicted tensor-
to-scalar ratio is too high to be compatible with observa-
tions [2]. There may be ways of curing this, for example
by having a non-minimal coupling between the inﬂaton
and spacetime curvature, but we will not attempt to do
that.

ini/(12M 2

pl) ≈ g2φ4

Recalling the discussion below Eq. (5) and using
H 2
ini ≈ λφ4
implies that
Hini = 3.22 × 10−6Mpl. From Eq. (6), we then ﬁnd
(cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) = 1.44 × 10−11M 2
pl, which provides the square of
the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution from
which we draw the initial values of χ.

ini/(24M 2

pl),

For the mean of the distribution, ¯χ, we choose ¯χi =
(i) × 10−5Mpl where i runs from 2 to 9, and run 104 sim-
ulations for each. Since the data drawn for these values
overlap, we are also able to reweight the data to calcu-
late results for mean values in between the initial choices.
Finally, by resampling the data using the so-called boot-
strap approach, we can determine the approximate one
sigma error on our results.

The results together with uncertainties are shown in
Fig. 2. The horizontal line shows the amplitude Pinf
of the perturbations generated by the inﬂaton ﬁeld. In
Fig. 1 for illustrative purposes we also show how the N (χ)

10−810−710−610−5χini−2024681012δN=ln(aend/aref)*105λ=10−141235

We choose λ = 10−14, again with g2/λ = 2. This
value of λ leads to an inﬂaton contribution to the power
spectrum of Pinf = 1.19 × 10−10, and Hubble rate Hini =
7.59 × 10−7Mpl. The χ ﬁeld variance is (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) = 8.028 ×
10−13M 2
pl. For the mean value ¯χ, we choose ¯χi = (i) ×
10−6Mpl where i runs from 5 to 12, and proceed as in
Case 1.

As shown in Fig. 2, the preheating contribution to ζ is
sub-dominant to that produced by the inﬂaton ﬁeld, and
therefore this case does not produce suﬃcient curvature
perturbations to be compatible with observations. The
non-Gaussianity parameter fNL is larger than in Case 1,
as shown in Fig. 3. Once again we ﬁnd that the expansion
method fails in the regions where the power spectrum is
most suppressed and the error bars appear largest.

3. Case 3 : λ = 10−16

For smaller values of λ, Pinf is of course even smaller,
and it is expected that Ppre will be too. It is however
interesting to explore such cases for the following reason.
If the regular δN formalism was applicable one would ex-
pect both contributions to ζ to scale in proportion to the
energy scale at horizon crossing, but there is no guarantee
this will happen in the non-perturbative case.

For λ = 10−16 one ﬁnds Pinf = 1.19 × 10−12, Hini =
7.59 × 10−8Mpl and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) = 8.028 × 10−15M 2
pl. For
this case we choose representative examples ¯χi = (i) ×
10−7Mpl where i runs from 5 to 12, and our results are
also presented in Fig. 2. Once again Ppre is smaller than
Pinf , but we see that in this case it is suppressed by a
smaller factor. Again for interest we can calculate fNL,
and present the results in Fig. 3.

4. Case 4 : λ = 10−18

Finally we consider g2/λ = 2 and λ = 10−18. In this
case we have Pinf = 1.19 × 10−14, Hini = 7.59 × 10−9Mpl
and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) = 8.028 × 10−17M 2
pl . We pick ¯χi = (i) ×
10−8Mpl where i runs from 5 to 12. Results are shown in
Fig. 2 and 3 for the amplitude of the power spectrum and
interestingly we now ﬁnd that the preheating contribu-
tion, Ppre, is greater than the inﬂationary contribution.

5. Discussion

√

It is interesting to note that in all cases the typical
value of Ppre is very similar. This can be understood by
noting that here we have taken a range of ¯χ that is scaled
in proportion to 1/
λ in each case, as is the square root
of the variance of χ at the initial time. Moreover for this
particular system, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect of reducing λ is
to shift the pattern of spikes seen in Fig. 1 to lower values
λ, but are otherwise very
of χ roughly in proportion to

2. Case 2 : λ = 10−14

As an alternative to Case 1, we also consider cases in
which the inﬂaton contribution is below the observational
value amplitude. We calculate the contribution from the
preheating ﬁeld to see whether it can be larger than the
inﬂaton contribution, and whether it could account for

This is a consequence of the conformal invariance
of the system. Since all elements of the calculation that
go into evaluating Eq. (1) scale in the same way, the an-
swer is largely unchanged. This is in stark contrast with
the contribution to ζ from the inﬂation. Nevertheless,
the resulting amplitude Ppre is smaller than the observed
value, and therefore this mechanism cannot account for
the observed curvature perturbations.

In cases where the expansion method can be trusted,
the spectral index of the preheating contribution is inher-
ited directly from the spectrum of the isocurvature ﬂuc-
tuations at the initial time, but given the lack of compat-
ibility with observations we don’t pursue its calculation
further.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The main purpose of this work was to show that
through lattice simulations it is possible to calculate the
power spectrum and bispectrum of the primordial curva-
ture on observational scales when a preheating ﬁeld plays
a signiﬁcant role. We have demonstrated this explicitly
by considering the massless preheating model. We found
in all the cases we looked at, that even when the ho-
mogeneous mode is within the strong resonance regime
(when g2/λ ≈ 2), the contribution from the preheating
ﬁeld to the power spectrum is much lower than the ob-
served value. We did ﬁnd however that it could dominate
over the inﬂaton contribution because it remains roughly
constant as the energy scale is lowered, in contrast to the
contribution from the inﬂation. This is in stark contrast
to the expected behaviour for a contribution produced
during inﬂation. We also found that it is highly sensi-
tive to the mean value of the reheating ﬁeld, and that it
is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that found
in earlier analytical studies. These ﬁndings indicate the
importance of calculating this contribution on a case by
case and model by model basis. Finally, we also exper-
imented with reducing the ratio g2/λ, which gradually
moves the homogeneous mode out of the preheating res-
onance band, and as expected the contribution of the
reheating ﬁeld to the curvature perturbation decreased
further in these cases.

For the value of λ for which the inﬂaton contribution
to the curvature perturbation provides the observed am-
plitude, we found that the preheating ﬁeld leads to a sub-
dominant contribution to the power spectrum, but can
provide the dominant contribution to the bispectrum for
some range of initial conditions.

It is worth contrasting our study with earlier ones. In
contrast to early work [7–10], which we otherwise follow
closely, we do not rely on a Taylor expansion in δN , but
instead compute the statistics of the curvature pertur-
bations on large scales using an expansion in powers of
the ﬁeld correlator. Our methods and aims are very sim-
ilar to those of [12], but that work did not work directly
with simulation data, but rather the previously generated
function in the work of Ref. [10].

Our study relied on an expansion of the full non-
perturbative δN formalism described in Ref. [13], and
we found that this was valid except in cases where the
leading contribution dropped oﬀ signiﬁcantly. It would
be possible to do better using the fully non-perturbative
method as described in that work, but this would require
us to run many more simulations. Moreover we assumed
that the inﬂaton contribution and the preheating ﬁeld’s
contribution to ζ were uncorrelated, and we could treat
the preheating ﬁeld as a light Gaussian spectator right
up to the point it becomes massive. In general, one can
do better than these approximations either analytically
or by using codes such as that described in Ref. [26].
In the present case to go beyond what we have done is
not warranted, given that it would be very unlikely to
change the incompatibility of the scenario with observa-
tions. Nevertheless for more realistic models, for example
that of Ref. [9], one might need to turn to these methods
to confront models that need to be studied with lattice
simulations with observations. The present work, how-
ever, establishes the feasibility of doing this.
