ABSTRACT
Accreting magnetic white dwarfs oÔ¨Äer an opportunity to understand the interplay between spin-up and spin-down torques in
binary systems. Monitoring of the white dwarf spin may reveal whether the white dwarf spin is currently in a state of near-
equilibrium, or of uni-directional evolution towards longer or shorter periods, reÔ¨Çecting the recent history of the system and
providing constraints for evolutionary models. This makes the monitoring of the spin history of magnetic white dwarfs of high
interest. In this paper we report the results of a campaign of follow-up optical photometry to detect and track the 39 sec white
dwarf spin pulses recently discovered in Hubble Space Telescope data of the cataclysmic variable V1460 Her. We Ô¨Ånd the spin
pulsations to be present in ùëî-band photometry at a typical amplitude of 0.4 %. Under favourable observing conditions, the spin
signal is detectable using 2-meter class telescopes. We measured pulse-arrival times for all our observations, which allowed us
to derive a precise ephemeris for the white dwarf spin. We have also derived an orbital modulation correction that can be applied
to the measurements. With our limited baseline of just over four years, we detect no evidence yet for spin-up or spin-down of the
white dwarf, obtaining a lower limit of |ùëÉ/ (cid:164)ùëÉ| > 4 √ó 107 years, which is already 4 to 8 times longer than the timescales measured
in two other cataclysmic variable systems containing rapidly rotating white dwarfs, AE Aqr and AR Sco.

1 INTRODUCTION

The spin rates of accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variable
binary stars are determined by competing mechanisms which add
or extract angular momentum. On the one hand, accreting material
of high speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum drives the white dwarf to spin
faster. The concentrated internal structures of white dwarfs, together
with their shrinkage in response to increased mass, means that only
‚àº 0.1 M(cid:12) of added matter is needed in principle to bring a white
dwarf close to its few second maximal breakup spin rate (Livio &
Pringle 1998). However, there are no systems known to be very close
to this limit, presumably because white dwarfs can also lose angular
momentum in three ways. First, white dwarfs accreting hydrogen-
rich material undergo thermonuclear runaways once 1 √ó 10‚àí6 M(cid:12) to
1 √ó 10‚àí4 M(cid:12) of matter has accumulated, causing their envelopes to
expand (Paczynski & Zytkow 1978; Wolf et al. 2013). Core-envelope
coupling during these phases can be expected to slow the white

dwarfs‚Äô spin rates (Livio & Pringle 1998). Second, magnetic white
dwarfs couple through their Ô¨Åelds to the accretion disc or to the binary
companion, causing their spin rates to slow. In the limit of very strong
Ô¨Åelds their spins lock to the binary orbit, as seen in the polar class
of accreting white dwarfs, also known as AM Her stars (Joss et al.
1979; Campbell 1983). A third possible mechanism is through tides,
which are likely to be important for ultra-compact orbits and during
double white dwarf mergers (Fuller & Lai 2012).

Magnetic white dwarfs are of particular interest because they re-
veal their spin periods through photometric variations induced by
spots, which result from accretion rate asymmetries caused by their
Ô¨Åelds. This allows the measurement of extremely precise spin pe-
riods to reveal the competing eÔ¨Äects of accretion versus magnetic
drag on a year by year basis (Patterson 1984). This plays out in the
intermediate polar (IP) class of system. IPs have spin periods of order
minutes to tens of minutes (Patterson 1994). These are rates much
slower than breakup, but faster than their binary periods, reÔ¨Çecting
a quasi-equilibrium between spin-up and magnetic drag that is con-

tinuously adjusting to a Ô¨Çuctuating accretion rate (Patterson 1984;
Kennedy et al. 2016; LittleÔ¨Åeld et al. 2020)

2015; Parsons et al. 2021). Importantly, it sidesteps the problem of
spinning up a highly magnetic white dwarf.

Not all systems exist in quasi-equilibrium. One of the Ô¨Årst recog-
nised cataclysmic variables, AE Aquarii, shows remarkable Ô¨Çaring
behaviour that is thought to be driven by magnetically-propelled ma-
terial exiting the system (Wynn et al. 1997). AE Aqr was unique in
this behaviour amongst the thousands of known systems until the
recent discovery of LAMOST-J024048.51+195226.9 (Thorstensen
2020; Garnavich et al. 2021a). The white dwarf in AE Aqr has a spin
period of 33 sec (Patterson 1979) and is spinning down on a short
107 yr timescale (de Jager et al. 1994) and it is thought that little or
no accretion takes place. Instead the system is now in a spin-powered
state which powers not just the Ô¨Çares, but also a broad synchrotron
spectrum extending to radio frequencies (Bookbinder & Lamb 1987).
AE Aqr is not in equilibrium, but is instead being observed in what
appears to be a relatively brief evolutionary phase compared to the
several billion year lifetimes of cataclysmic variables. A similar, pos-
sibly more advanced, state has been reached by the system AR Sco,
which, like AE Aqr, is also a strong synchrotron source (Marsh et al.
2016). The white dwarf in AR Sco, whose spin period is 118 sec,
is spinning down on a timescale of 5 √ó 106 yr (Stiller et al. 2018;
Gaibor et al. 2020), and in this case the system appears to be entirely
detached (Marsh et al. 2016; Garnavich et al. 2021b), with no accre-
tion and no evidence for propeller-induced Ô¨Çaring activity (LittleÔ¨Åeld
et al. 2017).

It is not yet clear how systems like AE Aqr and AR Sco achieved
their current states. Although their magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths have
not been directly measured, the absence of accretion discs and the
rates of spin down have led to estimates ranging from 50 MG to
200 MG (Ikhsanov 1998; Katz 2017). White dwarfs with Ô¨Åelds this
high are hard to spin up to the short periods seen in AE Aqr and
AR Sco, because very high accretion rates are needed to compress
the magnetosphere down to a radius at which the Keplerian orbital
period in the disc is this short. While there are signs of a high rate of
accretion in AE Aqr‚Äôs recent past (Schenker et al. 2002), there is no
similar evidence in the case of AR Sco. Perhaps the Ô¨Åeld estimates
are simply far too large (Lyutikov et al. 2020), but that would still
leave an open question of why these two systems in particular have
lost their discs.

A radically diÔ¨Äerent hypothesis for AR Sco has been recently
put forward by Schreiber et al. (2021). They proposed that the white
dwarf in AR Sco only became magnetic as a result of a crystallisation-
and rotation-driven dynamo, similar to the mechanism thought to be
at work in planets and low-mass stars. In their model, which was
derived from an explanation for white dwarf magnetism initially put
forward by Isern et al. (2017), the carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a
post common envelope binary with a main sequence star is originally
non-magnetic. As the system evolves towards shorter orbital periods,
the white dwarf cools and the companion evolves towards a Roche-
lobe Ô¨Ålling star. When that happens, the binary becomes a cataclysmic
variable, and accretion spins up the white dwarf, whose core might
be crystallising. If that is the case, conditions for a dynamo ‚Äì strong
density stratiÔ¨Åcation and convection ‚Äì are met, generating a magnetic
Ô¨Åeld. If the Ô¨Åeld is strong enough, the disc may be disrupted and
connection with the secondary star Ô¨Åeld will provide a synchronising
torque on the white dwarf spin. Again, if the Ô¨Åeld is strong enough,
the rapid transfer of spin angular momentum into the orbit may cause
the binary to detach and mass transfer to cease. AR Sco might be
an example of such a system. This provides a natural explanation
for the high incidence of magnetism amongst cataclysmic variable
stars (36%, Pala et al. 2020), together with a near total absence of
magnetism amongst their progenitor systems (Liebert et al. 2005,

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì8 (2021)

Schreiber et al. (2021)‚Äôs hypothesis makes accreting white dwarfs
of short spin period of very high interest, as they could be systems
whose Ô¨Åelds have only recently emerged, and they might now be
in a state of rapid spin down. Whether this is the case, or whether
they are in fact in a state of quasi-equilibrium, possible for relatively
weak Ô¨Åelds at short spin periods, can only be established through
observation.

One such short period white dwarf has been recently-discovered
in V1460 Her (Ashley et al. 2020). V1460 Her is an eclipsing cat-
aclysmic variable with a 4.99 h orbital period and an over-luminous
K5-type donor star. It is the third fastest spinning white dwarf
known amongst the cataclysmic variables, with a spin period of
38.875(5) sec (Ashley et al. 2020). Amongst cataclysmic variable
stars, only the white dwarfs in AE Aqr (33 sec) and CTCV J2056-
3014 (29.6 sec, Lopes de Oliveira et al. 2020) spin faster, although
the X-ray binary HD 49798 contains a ùëÉspin = 13 sec compact com-
ponent that might be a white dwarf (Israel et al. 1997; Mereghetti
et al. 2011). An evolved companion is another unusual characteristic
among CVs that is shared by V1460 Her and AE Aqr. Only 5 ¬± 3% of
CVs are found to have evolved companions (Pala et al. 2020), which
is at odds with the theoretical prediction of 30% (Schenker et al.
2002).

Since discovering the rapid pulsations betraying the presence of the
white dwarf spin in V1460 Her‚Äôs HST UV data (Ashley et al. 2020),
we have obtained multiple epochs of high-speed optical photometry
in an eÔ¨Äort to detect and monitor the spin. In this paper we present
the results of this campaign aimed at establishing the spin history of
the magnetic white dwarf V1460 Her since its recent discovery.

2 OBSERVATIONS

Our follow-up observations of V1460 Her were carried out at the
2.0-m Liverpool Telescope (LT), the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Tele-
scope (NOT), the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT), the
Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope
(TNT). The details of our observing runs are shown in Table 1.

At the LT, we used the optical wide-Ô¨Åeld camera IO:O with a 2x2
binning to reduce the readout time. Observations were taken with the
Sloan ùëî Ô¨Ålter. Given a rather slow readout time of 18 sec, we chose
exposure times of 10‚Äì12 sec to avoid too much loss of signal, even
though the resulting cadence of 28.6‚Äì30.6 sec was sub-Nyquist for
the spin signal in V1460 Her.

The WHT runs used the QHY CMOS detector at prime focus with
a windowed conÔ¨Åguration aimed at minimising readout time. For the
two initial runs in February 2021, the Astronomik B Ô¨Ålter, which
has a similar throughput to Sloan ùëî, was used. For the following two
runs, in May 2021, the Sloan ùëî Ô¨Ålter was used. The exposure time
was set to 5 sec, which resulted on a cadence of 7.8 sec accounting
for the readout time of 2.8 sec.

At the TNT, the high-speed camera ULTRASPEC (Dhillon et al.
2014) was employed, with a ùëî Ô¨Ålter and exposure time varying be-
tween 4.8 and 9.6 sec depending on the observing conditions, with
only 15 msec lost between exposures.

NOT observations were executed with ALFOSC, a multimode
imager/spectrograph. We used a subwindow binned by a factor of two
yielding a 2 sec dead time. A ùëî Ô¨Ålter was used, except for observations
starting on 2020-05-30, which used a ùëà Ô¨Ålter. The exposure time for
both g and ùëà band data was 3 sec.

The Caltech HIgh-speed Multi-color camERA (CHIMERA, Hard-

ing et al. 2016) provided data from the 200-inch Hale telescope at
Palomar observatory. The ùëî Ô¨Ålter was used in the blue channel. In
the red, the K-type star companion dominates the light, diluting the
signal from the white dwarf. Therefore, only the blue channel data are
used here. The CCD was operated using the 0.1 MHz conventional
ampliÔ¨Åer with 1 second exposures with 2x2 binning, and used frame
transfer to eÔ¨Äectively eliminate time lost due to reading out between
exposures.

All our observations were bias subtracted and Ô¨Çat-Ô¨Åeld corrected.
Observation times were corrected to Barycentric Julian Date (BJD)
in the Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) reference system. For
each image, diÔ¨Äerential aperture photometry was carried out. We
have used a variable aperture size, set to scale with the seeing mea-
sured from a point-spread function (PSF) Ô¨Åt, to accommodate varia-
tions in the atmospheric conditions. We chose as our main compar-
ison Gaia EDR3 1382561212513336064, a nearby star with similar
colour to V1460 Her and, in particular, showing low astrometric ex-
cess noise and Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE) in Gaia,
which are proxies for variability (Belokurov et al. 2020). For one
of our TNT observations, using this comparison star yielded poor
results. In this case, we have used instead a brighter comparison star,
TYC 3068-855-1. Using this bright comparison is not possible for
most of our observations, as it is often saturated. For the NOT runs,
SDSS J162123.10+441241.6 was used as the comparison star.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Detection of the pulsations

We computed the amplitude spectrum for each separate run, follow-
ing subtraction of a spline to remove orbital-related variations. Data
taken while the white dwarf was eclipsed were masked. An example
of this procedure is shown in Fig. 1, and the amplitude spectra of
all runs is shown in Fig. 2. The spin pulsation signal was always de-
tected in our WHT runs, and is clear in our CHIMERA run as well. It
is also detected in the three ùëî-band NOT observations, though with
high uncertainty for one of them (due to bright Moon conditions),
but not in the ùëà-band run. For the TNT runs, the signal is detected
in all but three runs, which were aÔ¨Äected by detector pickup noise
and/or poor observing conditions (clouds and/or bright Moon). In
the case of the Liverpool Telescope observations, detection is only
marginally possible owing to the slow detector readout time along
with the consequent sub-Nyquist sampling and loss of signal. We
detected the signal with an uncertainty smaller than 30% in only one
of our Ô¨Åve LT runs.

3.2 Measurement of pulse times

We measured a single time and uncertainty for each discrete run
representing the time of peak Ô¨Çux ùëá0 by Ô¨Åtting a cosine with a period
Ô¨Åxed to Ashley et al. (2020)‚Äôs measurement (see Fig. 1 inset), but
with an arbitrary zeropoint in time. The Ô¨Åts were carried out to the
spline-subtracted data described in Section 3.1. The zeropoint times
from such measurements are uncertain by arbitrary oÔ¨Äsets of integer
multiples of the period. However, any error in the period used for
the Ô¨Åt will be ampliÔ¨Åed if oÔ¨Äsets are chosen that move the selected
time far from the data upon which it is based. Therefore we selected
values close to the mid-time of each dataset in every case. Runs of a
length signiÔ¨Åcant compared to the 4.99 h orbital period were split into
sub-sections in order to be sensitive to possible orbital modulation,
which is expected if the periodic signal contains orbital side-bands

the data shown in black was used for Ô¨Åtting a spline, shown as a red dashed
line. The spline-subtracted data is shown in the middle panel. The amplitude
spectrum of these data is shown in the bottom panel, with the spin period

spline-subtracted data (in grey) folded on the spin period, with the cosine Ô¨Åt

as is often the case in IPs (e.g. Kennedy et al. 2016; Patterson et al.
2020). Table 2 shows the measured times, along with cycle number
counts whose derivation we detail in the next section. Uncertainties
are given by the standard deviation after a thousand bootstrapping
iterations, in which data points were sampled allowing for repeated
values and then reÔ¨Åtted.

3.3 Fixing the cycle counts

We calculated integer pulse cycle numbers for all data over a Ô¨Ånely-
spaced grid covering two dimensions representing adopted spin pe-
riod and spin phase oÔ¨Äset, the two unknowns of the problem. We
searched over a set of periods centred on the previously determined
period of 38.875(5) sec from Ashley et al. (2020), extending over
an interval of ¬±5ùúé on either side, where ùúé is Ashley et al. (2020)‚Äôs
uncertainty estimate. The phase oÔ¨Äset grid extended from 0 to 1, i.e.
over an entire cycle. Any given period/phase oÔ¨Äset pair within the
grid leads to a set of integer cycle counts which can then be used
to Ô¨Åt a linear ephemeris to the data from which a ùúí2 value results.
For any Ô¨Åxed period, it is important to optimise over the phase oÔ¨Äset

one panel is shown for a few runs, each panel corresponding to one of the time intervals.

since it is not known in advance and it can result in cycle numbers
Ô¨Çipping by plus or minus a cycle, hence our use of a 2D search grid.
Fig. 3 shows the resulting ùúí2 as a function of period, after selection
of the minimum ùúí2 over all phase oÔ¨Äsets for each period.

This is the stage at which one can tell if the observations are suf-
Ô¨Åcient to Ô¨Åx the cycle counts uniquely. If they are not, there will be
multiple aliases with similar minimum ùúí2 values. Any with com-
parable values of ùúí2 need to be regarded as potential candidate
periods, with more data being required to distinguish between them.
We Ô¨Ånd that the second deepest minimum has a ùúí2 more than 300
larger than our favoured period (see Fig. 3), and still > 100 after
scaling uncertainties to give reduced ùúí2 = 1. This is comfortably
above the threshold diÔ¨Äerence of 10 found to yield reliable periods
by Morales-Rueda et al. (2003) in their study of sdB orbital peri-
ods1. This absence of any competing aliases shows that there is only
one viable period and that the cycle counts are uniquely determined.
The location of the best period within less than 2ùúé of Ashley et al.
(2020)‚Äôs favoured value is further support of the proposed solution.
In order to deÔ¨Åne the epoch of cycle number 0, we performed a
linear ephemeris Ô¨Åt for diÔ¨Äerent ùëá0 values, separated by an integer
number of cycles and spanning the time interval of our observations.

1 The reasoning is that the probability of a period is dominated by the term
exp(‚àíùúí2/2), therefore a diÔ¨Äerence of more than 10 implies that the second-
best alias is at least exp(5) (cid:39) 150 times less probable than the best.

We monitored the resulting covariance between ùëá0 and period in
order to Ô¨Ånd the location of the minimum. We elected the value
that minimised this covariance as ùëá0. This results in the following
ephemeris for the time of maximum brightness:

where E is the cycle number. The time scale is TDB, corrected to
the barycentre of the solar system, expressed as a ModiÔ¨Åed Julian
Day number (MJD = JD-2400000.5). Uncertainties were determined
from a thousand Monte-Carlo runs of the linear ephemeris Ô¨Åt, re-
sampling the derived times of maxima each time according to their
uncertainties.

3.4 Modulation with orbital period

In order to identify whether the spin signal presents any orbital
modulation, we have calculated the orbital phase for each of our
measurements using the orbital ephemeris derived by Ashley et al.
(2020). We have subtracted the calculated (C) cycle count from the
observed (O) value for each epoch to inspect the O-C diagram for
any hints of dependence on the orbital phase. The top panel of Fig. 4
shows the result for all our observing runs. The highly variable size
of the errorbars, which are strongly dependent on the instrument
and observing conditions, make it hard to achieve any conclusion
regarding orbital modulation.

To minimise the eÔ¨Äect of observing conditions and remove the

eÔ¨Äect of diÔ¨Äerent instruments, we have repeated the same exercise
for a single WHT run with a duration of 7.3 hours. Given the high
quality of the WHT data, the spin period can often be detected
within a short time interval. To optimise the number of detections
for this run, our procedure was to start with a small chunk of data
spanning Ô¨Åve minutes, and compute the value of ùëá0 as described in
Section 3.2. If the obtained value had an uncertainty smaller than
3% of the spin period, it was accepted; otherwise the time interval
was increased by two minutes. This was repeated iteratively until
the desired uncertainty was achieved, or the time interval reached an
hour. Once a value was accepted, the same procedure was repeated for
the next chunk of data, starting with the Ô¨Årst value after the previous
time interval, i.e. we allowed for no overlap between the data ranges
used for each detection. The result is shown in the bottom panel of
Fig. 4. With this more homogeneous dataset, the orbital modulation
becomes clear.

We can therefore estimate a correction to derived ùëá0 values depend-
ing on the orbital phase in order to remove any eÔ¨Äects of modulation.
This modulation is not solely the result of the white dwarf orbital
motion, which can explain at most ‚àº 1.8 sec out of the observed range
of ‚àº 7 sec, but is likely largely caused by the eÔ¨Äect of beat signals
slightly shifting the period peak. As shown in Fig. 4, we calculate
the modulation correction by Ô¨Åtting a sinusoidal curve to the WHT
data. We obtained:
ùëá0corr = 3.40(43) sec √ó sin[2ùúãùúëorb + 1.25(6)]
(2)
where ùúëorb is the orbital phase of each measurement, and the phase
constant shown is in radians. Uncertainties were obtained by boot-
strapping. We note that this correction is not applied for the times
shown in Table 2. Applying this correction, we have re-derived our
ephemeris, obtaining:

BMJD(TDB) = 58888.0183511(17) + 0.0004498988053(12)ùê∏. (3)

Similarly, we can also investigate any orbital modulation of the
spin amplitude. Fig. 5 shows the estimated pulse amplitude as a
function of orbital phase. Unlike the pulse times, the amplitudes
show no dependence on the orbital phase, and the observed scatter is
consistent with a Gaussian distribution according to a normality test.

3.5 The long-term spin behaviour of the white dwarf

With a baseline of only just over four years, and with essentially just
three observing "seasons" in place, it is early days to constrain the
spin evolution of the white dwarf in V1460 Her. However, already
we have some sensitivity to the short evolutionary timescales seen in
the systems AE Aqr and AR Sco discussed in the introduction.

After applying the correction given by Eq. 2 to our derived pulse
times, we have inspected the O-C diagram as a function of cycle
number as shown in Fig. 6. We show for comparison the expected
O-C behaviour for a spin-down of ùëÉ/ (cid:164)ùëÉ = 5 √ó 106 yr (as estimated for
AR Sco, Stiller et al. 2018), and for 107 yr (that of AE Aqr, de Jager
et al. 1994). From our current dataset, there does not seem to be any
indication of spin variability for V1460 Her, at least in timescales
comparable to the these two similar systems. The O-C measurements
are instead scattered around zero (see Fig. 6).

In order to place a lower limit on the evolutionary timescale of the
spin period, we performed a quadratic Ô¨Åt to the ephemeris, corrected
for the orbital modulation, using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
method, implemented with emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013).
As expected, the quadratic term is poorly constrained and consistent
with zero. Adopting the 1% percentile as the lower limit, we obtain
|ùëÉ/ (cid:164)ùëÉ| > 4 √ó 107 yr. With the detection of the optical pulsations and

an ephemeris secure over a timescale of years, it should be possible
to improve upon this limit rapidly in the future since any quadratic
signal grows with the square of the baseline. However, this timescale,
which is longer than is seen in either AE Aqr or AR Sco, suggests
that V1460 Her may be in a state of quasi-equilibrium as opposed to
a short-lived state of spin down.

4 SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

We have detected the spin pulsations of V1460 Her in the optical for
the Ô¨Årst time. This is particularly important for long-term monitoring
of the spin, as optical detection implies that observations can be
carried out with ground-based telescopes. Our data shows that the
spin can be detected even for 2-meter class telescopes like the TNT,
provided that the observing conditions are favourable.

We have executed 35 observing runs over more than one year.
Combining our observations with the HST data from Ashley et al.
(2020), we obtained a total of 44 detections of the spin with timing
uncertainty better than 30%, given that some runs allowed for more
than one measurement. This allowed for a much more precise estimate
of the ephemeris (Eq. 1) compared to the values of Ashley et al.
(2020).

We have also identiÔ¨Åed an orbital modulation of the pulse arrival

same for AE Aqr (ùëÉ/ (cid:164)ùëÉ = 1 √ó 107 yr). Although sparsely sampled in the Ô¨Årst

times. Modelling this eÔ¨Äect, we have derived a correction (Eq. 2,
which we applied to our derived times to present improved ephemeris
(Eq. 3), and to investigate the long-term behaviour of the spin fre-
quency. Although we believe we see signs of modulation of the pulse
phase with orbital period, we note that the amplitude of the correction
is less than 0.1 spin cycles, so our conclusions are not qualitatively
aÔ¨Äected even if we apply no correction.

With the current baseline of just over four years, albeit sparsely
sampled at the start, we Ô¨Ånd no evidence for any change in the spin
period of V1460 Her, and place a lower limit on the timescale of
spin period changes of |ùëÉ/ (cid:164)ùëÉ| > 4 √ó 107 years. This suggests that
V1460 Her could currently be in a state of quasi-equilibrium caused
by a balance between accretion spin-up, and spin-down triggered by
magnetic torque. Measuring the spin variability in accreting fast-
spinning white dwarfs can ultimately enable us to probe the origin
of magnetic Ô¨Åelds in cataclysmic variables (Schreiber et al. 2021),
providing constraints on the evolution of interacting compact bina-
ries. Therefore, following the main result of this work that the spin
pulsations can be detected in the optical, we encourage continuous
monitoring of this system in order to conÔ¨Årm the quasi-equilibrium
behaviour, or possibly measure the spin change with a longer baseline
than presented here.
