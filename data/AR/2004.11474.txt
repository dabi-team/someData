ABSTRACT

We develop a model of the white dwarf (WD) - red dwarf (RD) binaries AR

Sco and AE Aqr as systems in a transient propeller stage of highly asynchronous

intermediate polars. The WDs are relatively weakly magnetized with magnetic

ﬁeld of ∼ 106 G. We explain the salient observed features of the systems due to

the magnetospheric interaction of two stars. Currently, the WD’s spin-down is

determined by the mass loading of the WD’s magnetosphere from the RD’s at a

mild rate of

˙MW D ∼ 10−11M(cid:12)/yr. Typical loading distance is determined by the

ionization of the RD’s wind by the WD’s UV ﬂux. The WD was previously spun

up by a period of high accretion rate from the RD via Roche lobe overﬂow with

˙M ∼ 10−9M(cid:12)/yr, acting for as short a period as tens of thousands of years. The

non-thermal X-ray and optical synchrotron emitting particles originate in recon-

nection events in the magnetosphere of the WD due to the interaction with the

ﬂow from the RD. In the case of AR Sco, the reconnection events produce signals

at the WD’s rotation and beat periods - this modulation is due to the changing

relative orientation of the companions’ magnetic moments and resulting variable

reconnection conditions. Radio emission is produced in the magnetosphere of

the RD, we hypothesize, in a way that it is physically similar to the Io-induced

Jovian decametric radiation.

1.

Introduction

Cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are interacting binary systems where a low-mass

donor star transfers mass to a white dwarf (WD) (Warner 2003). CVs can lead to a variety

of astrophysical phenomena that range from powerful thermonuclear explosions, to the

generation of non-thermal radio and high energy emission, and emission of low frequency

– 3 –

gravitational waves that may be detectable by the LISA mission (Toloza et al. 2019). Such

systems are formed when the more massive component in a stellar binary expands towards

the end of its stellar life and engulfs its companion; this brief and dynamically violent

common envelope phase shrinks the orbital separation, and results in a radically diﬀerent

evolution compared to single star evolution. In the resulting compact binary, gas ﬂows from

the donor star to the WD. The accretion of this gas onto the WD results in variability over

a range of timescales, from seconds to months.

A magnetized WD (mWD) adds another dimension to the mass exchange as the ﬁeld

can directly channel material to the vicinity of the mWD magnetic poles, speeding the

release of gravitational energy and generating strong non-thermal emission. CVs can then

be divided into magnetic and non-magnetic CVs, with the former further divided into

polars and intermediate polars. These systems were identiﬁed by the linear or circular

polarization of their optical light that varied with the binary orbital period, as found in the

prototypical system, AM Her (Warner 1995). Polars host strong B ∼7-230 MG magnetic

ﬁelds and are readily detectable by their strong, soft X-ray emission (Beuermann 1999;

Ferrario et al. 2015). The prototype for intermediate polar (IP) systems was DQ Her, and

later, AE Aqr, which exhibit multiple optical and perhaps X-ray periods, although these

pulsations are unpolarized, or only weakly polarized. IPs are bright, hard X-ray sources

(Barlow et al. 2006). The strong magnetic moments in polars cause synchronous rotation

with the binary orbital period. IPs have weaker magnetic ﬁelds of B ∼1-10 MG, which do

not lead to synchronous rotation, and as a result, the white dwarf primaries in these systems

rotate more quickly than the system orbital periods. The non-thermal radio emission from

magnetic CVs suggests that they may be divided into quiescent, weakly polarized, emitters

of mildly relativistic synchrotron, or gyrosynchrotron, radiation and more powerful sources

that exhibit highly circularly polarized radio emission driven by the electron cyclotron

maser (ECM) (Barrett et al. 2017).

– 4 –

There are two exceptional IPs, AR Sco and AE Aqr, where the spin of the WD is

extremely rapid compared with the system orbital period. These extreme asynchronous

polars have exceptional observational properties that have not been well explained from the

standard model of polars. Understanding the properties of these exceptional systems is the

main goal of the present work.

Most importantly, both AR Sco and AE Aqr show high levels of non-thermal emission

extending from radio to optical and X-rays. AR Sco, dubbed a “white dwarf pulsar”, shows

modulations on the WD’s spin and spin-orbital beat frequencies (see Marsh et al. 2016;

Buckley et al. 2017; Katz 2017; Takata et al. 2018; Stanway et al. 2018; Garnavich et al.

2019). In contrast, no isolated white dwarf produces pulsed radio emission (Wickramasinghe

& Ferrario 2000; Barrett et al. 2017).

AR Sco is arguably the most peculiar CV. On the one hand, the system appears similar

to a CV system in that it hosts an M4 dwarf secondary that orbits a WD primary. However,

additional observed properties defy classiﬁcation: (i) its spectral energy distribution (SED)

is dominated by a modulated non-thermal component with power L = 0.6 − 3.6 × 1032 erg

s−1; (ii) The WD is spinning down at a rate ˙P = 4 × 10−13; for a typical moment of inertia

of a WD the corresponding spindown luminosity Lsd is few ×1033 erg s−1. This exceeds

the emitted power by a factor ∼ 10; (iii) There is bright variable optical emission at the

beat of the WD and orbital periods; (iv) Optical emission is highly linear polarized at 40%,

modulated both on the harmonic of the spin and beat period; (v) X-ray luminosity is fairly

low, consistent mostly with thermal bremsstrahlung. (Weak high energy emission excludes

accretion as a driving mechanism.) (vi) WD mass is limited to 0.8M(cid:12) < MW D < 1.29M(cid:12);

(vii) There is variable high frequency (ν ∼ 10 GHz) radio emission from the RD that

exhibits strong orbital modulation while the low frequency (ν ∼ 1.5 GHz) emission is

relatively steady (importantly, there is no modulation in radio at the WD’s spin period -

– 5 –

this excludes the WD’s magnetosphere as the locus of radio emission).

The properties of the system imply that (i) the spin-down time τsd = Ω/ ˙Ω ≈ 107yr is

much smaller that the age of the WD inferred from it’s surface temperature ∼ 109 yrs; (ii)

the short spin period of the WD requires a previous accretion stage to be spun up; (iii) low

X-ray luminosity excludes accretion as an energy source; (iv) the WD light cylinder, which

has a radius of 6 × 1011 cm, is ∼ 10 times the orbital separation of the two stars. (v) The

RD is nearly Roche lobe-ﬁlling; it is also tidally locked.

In this paper we ﬁrst concentrate on the AR Sco system, and later on, §5, apply the

results to AE Aqr.

2. Models of the torque on the WD that do not work

Somewhat unconventionally, let us ﬁrst provide a critique of the current models of AR

Sco. First we will discuss what does not work, and later in §3 describe a model that is able

to explain the salient features of the system.

2.1. Not a WD pulsar

It is clear that the system involves interaction of the stars’ magnetospheres (or

wind-magnetosphere or wind-wind interaction). No isolated WDs come close to having the

parameters of AR Sco (e.g., spin-down power). In this sense, it is diﬀerent from radio

pulsars, which produce coherent radio emission in isolation. No isolated WD produces radio

emission, whether pulsed or steady (e.g., Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000). In the case

of AR Sco (and AE Aqr) it is clear that it is the interaction of the magnetosphere of the

primary with that of the secondary that accelerates the emitting particles, even though

– 6 –

ultimately it’s the rotational energy of the primary that gets converted into radiation. The

fact that only binary WDs, such as AR Sco and AE Aqr, produce radio emission may be

explained by the necessary evolutionary channel: WDs need to be spun up by accretion in

order to produce suﬃcient electric potential. Also, radio emission from AR Sco need not be

coherent.

The biggest challenge in understanding the system, in our view, is to reconcile large

present spin-down rates and the requirement of previous spin-up of the WD. Qualitatively,

the large current spin-down (seems) to imply large magnetic ﬁelds, while the need to

previously spin-up the WD requires small magnetic ﬁelds. The magnetic ﬁeld on the WD

should be low, as we argue next.

First, the vacuum dipole formula for WD spin-down is inapplicable: astrophysical

plasmas always have enough charges available to screen parallel electric ﬁeld (only in rare

localized circumstances like gaps in the magnetospheres of neutron star do some mild E(cid:107)

appears (Goldreich & Julian 1969; Sturrock 1971; Fawley et al. 1977)). This is especially

true since the WD’s light cylinder radius is much larger than the separation of the stars -

the RD produces a dense wind that would make the vacuum approach for WD spin-down

invalid.

Second, the possibility of a pulsar-like spin-down also does not work for AR Sco. Pulsar

spin-down (though qualitatively similar to the vacuum dipole case, but physically highly

diﬀerent) was also suggested (e.g.,

Ikhsanov 1998; Ikhsanov & Biermann 2006; Ikhsanov

& Beskrovnaya 2008, 2012). The idea is that the WD generates pair-dominated pulsar-like

wind (hence the term “White Dwarf Pulsar”, Buckley et al. 2017). Pulsars generate large

electric potential drops along magnetic ﬁeld lines that lead to vacuum breakdown, pair

creations (Rees & Gunn 1974; Fawley et al. 1977). These processes are accompanied by

abundant γ-ray production. Pulsars are bright γ-ray sources (Abdo et al. 2013). It is

– 7 –

possible that WDs can also break vacuum (Usov 1988). There is a clear prediction for

this model: production of high energy emission that accompanies pair production. The
available potential in AR Sco, Φ ∼ (cid:112)Lsd/c ∼ 1014 eV matches the weakest γ-ray pulsars.

For example, one of the brightest γ-ray pulsar, Geminga, is located at 250 pc (about 2.5

times further than AR Sco) and has spin-down power of 3.2 × 1034 erg s−1 (about ten times

higher). Although some γ-ray pulsars do have smaller spin-down powers than AR Sco

(Abdo et al. 2013), we disfavor this possibility, as no γ-ray emission is seen (Kaplan et al.

2019), and the X-ray emission is very weak (Li et al. 2016).

In addition to the theoretical problems outlined above, both the vacuum dipole

and pulsar spin-down formulae presented earlier yield extraordinary high magnetic ﬁeld

estimates for a WD (e.g., Katz 2017):

This is an exceptionally high magnetic ﬁeld for a WD.

A high magnetic ﬁeld on the WD is also inconsistent with the requirement that during

the preceding accretion state, the WD was spun up. Assuming that during the high

accretion rate stage all of the mass lost by the secondary accretes onto the WD, and using

the corotation condition at the edge of the magnetosphere

Using estimate (1) for the magnetic ﬁeld evaluates to 1.6 × 10−2M(cid:12)yr−1 which is unrealistic

2.2. Not WD’s magnetosphere - RD star interaction

Stellar winds created by the outﬂow of plasma along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines

are ubiquitous among stars and stellar remnants such as WDs. In the particular case of

a WD-RD binary the winds from both stars are magnetically driven. Depending on the

location of the critical (Alfv´en ) points in the winds, one can identify several cases: (i)

wind-wind interaction (both Alfv´en points inside the Roche lobes), (ii) magnetosphere-wind

interaction (one Alfv´en point is outside the Roche lobe); (iii) direct magnetospheric

interactions (both Alfv´en points beyond the Roche lobe); (iv) if one of the winds is very

weak, one can also envision direct wind-star and magnetosphere interactions.

For a radius of RRD ∼ 2.5 × 1010cm, the ratio of the RD’s radius to the separation is

RRD/a = 0.31. For the mass ratio q ≈ 0.4 (the emission measurements lead to the limit of

q > 0.35, Marsh) and using

(4)

for the size of the Roche lobe with q = 0.4 (Eggleton 1983), the size of the RD’s Roche lobe

is similar to it’s radius - the RD is nearly Roche lobe-ﬁlling.

Katz (2017) suggest that the interaction between the corotating WD magnetosphere

and the RD leads to higher spin-down rate of the WD. On basic grounds, if a star with

surface magnetic ﬁeld BW D and angular velocity ΩW D interacts with a particularly resistive

object of size Rint located at distance dint, the spin-down power can be estimated as

(this is a magnetic stress, assuming that the tangential component of the magnetic ﬁeld is

The corresponding required accretion rate during spin-up (3) is still unrealistically high,

˙M ≈ 10−4M(cid:12) yr−1.

2.3. Not WD’s magnetosphere - RD’s magnetosphere interaction

One possibility to increase the interaction size is through magnetic interaction of the

two magnetospheres or interaction of the WD’s magnetosphere with the extended wind of

the RD. In order to aﬀect the WD spin-down the balance between the interacting WD’s

and RD’s ﬂows should be inside the WD’s Alfven radius. The interaction is either between

the solidly rotating WD’s magnetosphere and the RD’s wind, or directly between two

magnetospheres. Here we discuss a case of direct magnetospheric interaction, Fig. 1. As

we discuss below, the magnetically interacting magnetospheres cannot explain the WD’s

spin-down. Yet, this process is important for the generation of emission, §4.

Assume that the stars have surface magnetic ﬁelds BW D and BRD. For the given radii,

RW D and RRD the force balance between two magnetospheres occurs at distance rint from

the RD given by

M dwarfs can have surface magnetic ﬁelds ∼ 103 G; as a result, the RD’s magnetosphere

can extend beyond its Roche lobe. For a WD with surface magnetic ﬁeld of 106 G the

plane containing the orbital momentum and the line connecting two stars) of the interacting

magnetic ﬁeld of the WD and the RD. The hashed line indicates the location of the recon-

nection region, where ﬁeld lines connect the surfaces of two stars. Orbital plane is horizontal,

the magnetic moment of the WD is in the orbital plane, pointing at the moment towards the

RD; the RD’s magnetic moment is along the orbits’ normal (pointing up); in the picture the

magnetic moment of the RD is 5 times that of the WD. The structure of the magnetosphere

is north-south asymmetric: in half a period of the WD’s rotation the asymmetry will reverse.

Note: object sizes and distances are not to scale.

balance between the magnetic ﬁelds will be at a distance ∼ 6.7 × 1010 cm - way inside

the WD’s Roche lobe. Only for a very low magnetic ﬁeld of the RD and extremely high

magnetic ﬁeld of the WD, so that BW D/BRD ≥ 106, will the balance between magnetic

pressures be inside the RD’s Roche lobe. Thus, the interaction between magnetospheres of

the companions will generally be within the WD’s Roche lobe.

At the balance point, the local magnetic ﬁeld is

The necessary ˙M , Eq. (3), is still too high,

˙M ∼ 3 × 10−5M(cid:12) yr−1.

Thus we conclude that magnetospheric interaction, the most eﬃcient of the scenarios

considered, cannot accommodate the requirements of large current spin-down and

eﬃcient spin-up during the accretion stage. Importantly, the magnetically interacting

magnetospheres cannot explain the WD’s spin-down, §2.3, yet this process is important for

the generation of emission, as we will describe further in §4.

Below, in §3, we demonstrate that the WD’s spin-down can be easily explained due to

mass loading of the RD’s wind onto the corotating WD’s magnetosphere.

3. The model of the WD’s torque: mass loading from the RD

In §2.1 we demonstrated that arguments in favor of high magnetic ﬁelds are untenable.

We concluded then that the WD’s spin-down is due to the interaction with a companion.

The key point then is to understand the WD-RD interaction and how it aﬀects the WD

spin-down and production of radiation. In this Section we discuss a model that can satisfy

both the condition of large current spin-down, and the requirement of the low magnetic

ﬁeld from the spin-up conditions, as shown in Fig. 2.

3.1. Magnetic ﬁeld of the WD must be low

We can estimate the WD’s magnetic ﬁeld using the condition that for a given mass

loss rate from the RD,

˙MRD, accretion onto the WD spins up the latter. Using (3) with

– 13 –

Fig. 2.— Cartoon of the model. The corotating magnetosphere of the WD extends beyond

the WD’s Roche lobe and interacts with the wind/magnetosphere of the red dwarf. The

red dwarf loses mass through the L1 point. The partially ionized accretion stream loads the

magnetosphere of the WD, providing large torque on the WD as it is ejected in the propeller

regime. Previously, when the mass loss rate from the RD was high, the WD was spun-up in

the accretor regime. Nonthermal particles are accelerated in the reconnection region between

the RD’s accretion ﬂow and the WD’s magnetosphere, producing optical and X-ray emission

near the WD and radio emission near the RD.

for the maximal accretion rate of

et al. 2011). Thus, the WD’s magnetic ﬁeld must be suﬃciently low to allow spin-up.

3.2. Mass loading from spherical RD wind?

Let us ﬁrst discuss a toy model with mass loading from a spherical RD wind. This

simple approach will allow us to make estimates of the main parameters of the system. As

we discuss below, §3.3.3, the actual mass loading occurs via Roche lobe overﬂow.

Assume that mass loading of the WD’s magnetosphere occurs at radius rA ≈ vA/Ω
with rate ˙MW D. In the propeller regime (the current state) the loaded material is ejected

with velocity ∼ rAΩW D. The system is governed by the following set of conditions

Thus, in order to account for the large spindown of the WD, the spherical accretion

requires a very large mass loss rate from a RD. In the following, we develop model of WD’s

mass loading through Roche lobe overﬂow and ensuing ionization.

3.3. Mass transfer via Roche lobe overﬂow

The atmospheres of RDs are relatively cold and dense; they are expected to be partially

ionized. If the neutral-ion collision rate in the RD’s wind is not high (this is far from

certain; see Garnavich et al. 2019), then the neutrals from the RD wind will stream freely

onto the magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD. They will be exposed to the UV radiation from

the surface of the WD that will lead to ionization. As the neutrals get ionized they will

couple to the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD, and will be centrifugally expelled from the system.

Below we give order-of-magnitude estimates for the eﬃciency of ionization, leaving a more

detailed analysis to a subsequent paper.

Next we discuss the RD-WD interaction that explains the key features of the WD’s

spin-down due to loading of the WD’s magnetosphere by the partially ionized RD’ wind.

We envision two possible scenarios: accretion onto the WD from a spherical wind from RD,

§3.2, and accretion via a tightly conﬁned matter stream caused by the Roche lobe overﬂow,

§3.3.3.

– 16 –

3.3.1. The temperature of the WD

The ionization eﬃciency of the WD’s radiation depends sensitively on its surface

temperature. Marsh et al. (2016) reported a surface temperature of TW D = 9750 K,

although it may be as high as TW D ≈ 12000 K, as we describe below based on the analysis

of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. This diﬀerence has important implications for the

ionization processes in the wind, §3.3.2.

To constrain the WD’s eﬀective temperature, we downloaded a grid of the Koester

(2010) WD atmospheric models spanning a wide range of eﬀective temperatures. We

assumed a surface gravity of log(g) = 8.5. We then scaled the spectra to the Gaia distance

of AR Sco (d=117 pc), assuming a WD radius of 7,000 km. Finally, we plotted the scaled

spectra and compared them against the HST /Cosmic Origins Spectrograph(COS) spectrum

(Marsh et al. 2016), Fig. 3.. We found that for TW D (cid:38) 13, 000 K, the WD’s photospheric

contribution would be detectable in the HST spectrum, so we adopt this as a upper limit

for the WD’s eﬀective temperature.

A limitation of this approach is that the Koester (2010) models neglect magnetic

eﬀects. Given the unknown magnetic ﬁeld strength of the WD, Zeeman splitting could

have a signiﬁcant impact on the WD’s photospheric lines. Higher signal-to-noise ratio UV

spectra obtained around orbital phases when the system its faintest would provide more

stringent limits on the WD properties.

– 17 –

Fig. 3.— A comparison between the averaged HST /COS spectrum of AR Sco (grey line)

and Koester (2010) WD models scaled to the Gaia distance. The observed spectrum is a

sum of the WD contribution, the varying synchrotron radiation from the interaction, and line

emission from the irradiated face of the secondary. The six colored lines represent WD models

for log(g) = 8.5 and diﬀer only in their eﬀective temperatures. The temperatures range

from 10,000 K (blue line) to 15,000 K (brown line) in increments of 1,000 K. Models with

temperatures higher than 13,000 K predict that the photospheric contribution of the WD

would be detectable, establishing an upper limit of TW D ≤ 13000 K for the WD temperature.

As noted in the text, the Koester (2010) spectra neglect magnetic eﬀects.

In the previous estimation we neglect the absorption of ionizing photons by neutrals.

Nevertheless, the secondary photons can ionize the matter in the stellar wind, the mass ﬂux

(24)

So, if rA ≥ rio,max in the spherically symmetric case the WD magnetosphere loading rate

depends on ionizing photon production rate only.

Thus, we can estimate the mass loading rate using two diﬀerent methods: Eq. (17)

and Eq. (24). The required WD’s temperature is then TW D = 12000 K. In contrast, Marsh

et al. (2016) estimated TW D ≤ 9750 K; this supplies ∼ 1/30 of the required UV photon

production rate. A new series of observations by HST at “oﬀ the peak” orbital phases

could clarify this problem.

In conclusion, we expect that the WD’s radiation can ionize hydrogen in the outer

parts of the RD’s corona, and in the surrounding area. On the other hand, if the mass ﬂow

from the RD is large, it can screen the ionizing radiation, so that the neutral component of

the RD’s ﬂow can penetrate the WD’s magnetosphere.

3.3.3. Mass transfer rates via Roche lobe overﬂow

Next we discuss a more realistic scenario based on mass transfer via Roche lobe

overﬂow.

In this case the main mass transfer process takes place through the ﬁrst

Lagrangian point L1. As a result, the wind mass loss rate from the RD can be much smaller

than for the spherical wind case discussed in the previous subsection §3.2. As a result, for

– 20 –

smaller “eﬀective” (isotropic-equivalent) mass loss rates, the radiation from the WD can

ionize the photosphere of RD. Still the matter ﬂowing through the L1 point can contain

neutral components.

In this case Eqns. (15) and (16) give

˙MW D ≈ ηsρsvAr2

˙MW D ≈ ξ ˙MRD,stream

here ρs is density of the stream, ηs is a constant order of 1 which take into account the

magnetosphere.

The rA and correspondingly vA are the same in Eq. (26) and Eq. (17), so the ﬂow rate

should be the same. Following the analysis in §3.2 we can estimate the magnetosphere mass

loading rate due to ionization of neutrals ﬂowing through the L1 point and the ionizing

photons number as

˙MW D ≈

(27)

In the case of the ﬂow from L1 point, the ionization photons ﬂux should be in 1/ηs if

compared to the spherical wind case.

The source of the UV photons can be both the WD as well as the nonthermal

synchrotron radiation from the interaction region. We hypothesize that in the latter case,

a self-regulating quasi-periodic system evolves through the following ionization states: 1)

– 21 –

“Plunging”: no nonthermal emission: the stream goes deeply into magnetosphere where it

starts to be ionized; 2) “photoionization”: strong interactions between the ionized matter

stream and magnetosphere produce nonthermal radiation which starts to ionize matter

in the stream; and 3) ”quenching”: the strongly ionized stream stops penetrating and

interacting with the WD magnetosphere, leading to suppression of nonthermal emission and

returning the system to phase 1. So, the system will oscillate around the equilibrium state.

4. Emission model: acceleration at reconnection between interacting

magnetospheres

4.1. Acceleration at reconnection

Interaction of the magnetic ﬁelds between the WD’s and the RD’s magnetospheres

will lead to reconnection. Particles will be heated and accelerated in the reconnection

events. The reconnecting magnetic ﬁelds connect back to the WD and to the RD, where the

accelerated particles will produce synchrotron/cyclotron emission within the corresponding

magnetospheres. The synchrotron origin of optical emission at the WD is consistent with

the highly linearly polarized optical signal, showing the polarization rotation (Buckley et al.

2017; du Plessis et al. 2019), similar to the rotating vector model in pulsars (Radhakrishnan

& Cooke 1969), see §4.2. The cyclotron origin of the radio emission in the RD is discussed

in §4.3.

The reconnection events are expected to produce signal at the beat frequency between

the WD’s spin and the orbital motion: as the ﬁeld lines from diﬀerent magnetic poles of

the WD sweep by the MD, the polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld in the wind changes every

half a period. Depending on the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld of the MD, reconnection

between the wind and MD’s magnetic ﬁeld occurs every period.

– 22 –

The reconnection between the WD’s wind and MD’s magnetosphere should proceed in

a somewhat typical fashion. The two plasma components have diﬀerent plasma properties:

very light WD’s magnetosphere and relatively heavy RD’s magnetosphere. Hence we expect

diﬀerent properties (density and temperature) on the two sides of any reconnection point.

In the frame of our model we expect strong deformation of the WD’s magnetosphere

due to interaction with stellar wind at the Alfvenic radius. Therefore, the plasma beta,

β = 8πp/B2

int ≈ 1. Reconnection in such plasmas proceeds in speciﬁc, unusual (from

the classical point of view) regimes (e.g., Lyutikov et al. 2017a,b). Particles can be,

under very extreme conditions, quickly accelerated up to the maximal available potential.

The maximal Lorentz factor of particles can be then estimated as a potential across the

reconnection region of size ∼ rA, magnetic ﬁeld Bint = BWD(rA/RWD)−3 ∼ 200 G and

velocity of incoming magnetic ﬁeld lines ΩrA (so that electric ﬁeld E ∼ (ΩrA/c)Bint)

γmax ≈

Φ ≈ rA

eΦ

(28)

here we substitute values from Eq. 26. This is a very high Lorentz factor, but this is the

upper estimate. As we demonstrate below, Eq. (32), the Lorentz factor of the electrons

accelerated towards the WD need to be ∼ 10−3 of the maximum possible value.

On the RD side the reconnection will be analogous to the solar magnetosphere, where

particles are heated and produce UV and soft X-ray emission; this explains the X-ray

emission from AR Sco. Non-relativistic exhaust jets that propagate with the local Alfv´en

velocity couple to the neutral component in the MD atmosphere/corona and generate

Hα features observed by Garnavich et al. (2019). Particles are also accelerated to mildly

relativistic energies and produce radio emission both in the interaction region and within

the RD corona.

rareﬁed WD magnetosphere.

4.2. Optical and X-ray emission: magnetosphere of the WD

We expect that in reconnection events particles are accelerated to power-law

distributions. In the highly variable magnetic ﬁeld of the WD’s magnetosphere particles

accelerated in the interaction region will be propagating downward, increasing their emitted

synchrotron frequency, while losing energy to synchrotron emission (and reﬂected due to

magnetic bottling). It is a fairly complicated problem how to calculate synchrotron emission

from a stream of particles propagating with the magnetospheres: (i) the basic cyclotron

frequency ωB changes with radius; (ii) in a collision-less plasma the particles’ pitch angles

change with radius due to conservation of the ﬁrst adiabatic invariant; (iii) the number of

particles that reach a given radius changes due to the bottling eﬀect; (iv) particle pitch

angles evolves due to radiative losses (e.g., Lyutikov & Thompson 2005). We leave a

more detailed consideration to subsequent paper. Here we just provide order–of-magnitude

estimates. In what follows we employ a concept that starting from the emission region with

a pre-deﬁned magnetic ﬁeld, for a given emission frequency and radiated power there are

optimal parameters to produce emission subject to the above constraints.

As an order-of-magnitude estimate, we assume that emission is dominated by particles

with the synchrotron cooling time of the order of c/rem (lower energy particles do no emit

eﬃciently since power ∝ γ2, while higher energy particles do not probe high magnetic

ﬁelds). To produce synchrotron emission at a frequency ω and overall power Ls ∼ 1032 erg

s−1 we need the number of particles Np emitting typically at distance rem to be such that:

Thus, relativistic particles in the WD magnetosphere emit optical emission at ≈ 10RW D.

The amount of mass participating in the optical emission ∼ mpNp ≈ 5 × 1010 g, is fairly
small. The magnetic ﬁeld in the optical emission region evaluates to Bem ≈ 2500ω−3/7

Takata et al. (2018) reported observations of AR Sco in the X-ray range with luminosity

For ωX ≈ 1019 rad s−1. The spectrum of the accelerated particles corresponds to f ∝ γ−p

with p ≈ 2. All very reasonable numbers.

The inverse Compton scattering of electrons with Lorentz factors given in (32) on the

WD’s photons with (cid:15)W D ∼ 1 eV would produce similar frequencies, (cid:15)IC ∼ γ2

em(cid:15)W D ∼ 104 eV.

The electrons with the maximum Lorentz factor (28) would produce IC emission in the

TeV range. Unfortunately, a magnetic energy density UB ≈ B2

em/8π ∼ 107 is much higher

than the soft photon energy density Uph ∼ Lo/4πcr2

em ∼ 30, so for the leptonic model, the

high energy emission can be estimated as LHE ∼ LoUph/UB ∼ 1026 erg/s. For a distance

∼100 pc we expect the observed ﬂux to be FHE ∼ 10−16 erg/s cm2.

In conclusion, optical and X-ray emission from the system originates due to synchrotron

emission of particles accelerated in reconnection events. Synchrotron cooling determines

the typical location and luminosity.

4.3. Radio emission

The radio emissions from AR Sco paint a murky picture of the underlying physical

processes that cause them. Marsh et al. (2016) found that AR Sco was a source

of broadband, pulsed, <10% circularly polarized radio emission at high brightness

temperatures (TB ∼ 1012 − 1014 K) for reasonable size estimates of the emitting region.

Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the system detected non-thermal

emissions that were 0 to -27% circularly polarized on timescales of ∼10 min at 1.5 GHz,

but only 0 to -8% at 5 and 9 GHz (Stanway et al. 2018). The measured linear polarization

fractions were small, totaling 0-3%, and therefore much smaller than the degree of linear

polarization measured at optical wavelengths. This small linear polarization fraction cannot

be explained by synchrotron radio emission from the WD magnetosphere alone, again

– 27 –

suggesting that AR Sco is not a “WD pulsar.”

We note that the observed properties of AR Sco bear many similarities to Jovian

radio emission, as predicted by Willes & Wu (2004) in their work on the ECM-generated

radio emissions anticipated to be found from planets that may orbit a WD. In our own

solar system, Jupiter is a bright radio source of decametric emission (DAM), see review by

Melrose (2017). DAM is nearly 100% circularly or elliptically polarized, and beamed in

a hollow cone perpendicular to the source magnetic ﬁeld, which indicates an ECM origin

(Zarka 1998). DAM emission is also driven by the binary interaction of magnetospheres -

in this case of Jupiter’s magnetosphere with Io (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1969). In this

example, the emission is produced by the electrons accelerated by Io’s generated inductive

electric ﬁeld. Many of these observed properties qualitatively resemble the radio emission

in AR Sco, which the present model also suggests is caused by the binary interaction of

magnetospheres.

An alternative explanation for AR Sco’s radio emissions is gyrosynchrotron radiation.

The standard ﬂare scenario on the Sun and other main sequence stars is that reconnection

in their magnetospheres accelerate electrons that emit mildly relativistic gyrosynchrotron

radiation at radio wavelengths, and hard X-rays via bremsstrahlung when they interact with

the denser layers of the corona (Bastian et al. 1998). This non-thermal emission mechanism

extends to red dwarfs of spectral types as late as M9. These “ultracool dwarfs” are sources

of quiescent, non-bursty, radio emissions at 2-8 GHz with circular polarization fractions

<35% that have been the subject of extensive plasma physics modeling eﬀorts (Metodieva

et al. 2017; Zic et al. 2019). Within the AR Sco system, low circular polarization fractions,

coupled with larger potential source region sizes imply the operation of an incoherent

emission process such as gyrosynchrotron radiation.

In addition to polarization fraction and brightness temperature measurements, another

– 28 –

means to distinguish between these two emission mechanisms is to leverage the G¨udel-Benz

relationship, which relates the thermalized X-ray luminosity generated by magnetic

reconnection in stellar ﬂares to the nonthermal, incoherent, gyrosynchrotron radio emission

that results from particle acceleration (for a review, see Benz & G¨udel (2010)). This

relationship is given by

LX
LR

∼ 1015.5±0.5 [Hz],

(34)

where LX is the X-ray luminosity and LR is the radio luminosity, usually computed as

νLν. Marsh et al. (2016) measured an X-ray luminosity of LX ≈ 4.9 × 1030 erg s−1 using

Swift/X-ray Telescope (XRT), which corresponds to a G¨udel-Benz relationship peak radio

luminosity νLν ∼ 4.9 × 1015 erg s−1.

In contrast to this low expected radio luminosity, Marsh et al. (2016) measured a

peak radio ﬂux density of Fν,peak ∼ 15 mJy at 9 GHz with the Australian Telescope

Compact Array (ATCA), which corresponds to a peak radio luminosity of νLν ∼ 2.3 × 1027

erg s−1. This is far in excess of the radio emission generated by typical stellar ﬂaring.

The combination of moderate circular polarization fractions coupled with a greater-than-

expected radio luminosity given the X-ray activity within the system indicates that both

gyrosynchrotron and ECM processes must be present, caused by the complex interactions

of the two magnetospheres.

Unlike X-ray and optical electrons which are accelerated to relativistic energies within

the WD magnetosphere, the radio electrons are not cooling eﬃciently, hence estimates

(29) are not applicable. The relatively large circular polarization fractions imply mildly

relativistic electrons at most. The frequency of 9 GHz can then be used to estimate the

magnetic ﬁeld on the RD: BRD ∼ 3 × 102γ2

0.5 G, where we assume mildly relativistic

electrons. The number of radio emitting electrons then estimates to

Nr ≈

RD

≈ 7 × 1035γ2

(35)

– 29 –

We note that if ECM emission is present within the RD magnetosphere, there should

exist a deﬁnite cutoﬀ frequency, νcf beyond which radio emission is not detected that

denotes the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength in the emitting region. The presence of this

spectral feature would enable the direct calculation of the magnetic ﬁeld strength and place

constraints on the emitting plasma density (e.g., Route & Wolszczan 2012).

Additional insight can be gained through analysis of the radio ﬂux variation within

the AR Sco system on timescales on the order of an orbital period. In Figure 4 of Stanway

et al. (2018), the radio emissions from 1-10 GHz create a sinusoidal envelope with peak

ﬂux density Fν,peak ∼ 12 mJy occurring near φorb ∼ 0.5, which corresponds to the WD

being closest to the Earth. Although the radio ﬂux density decreases to Fν ∼ 5 mJy

at φorb ∼ 0, it does not disappear entirely. This simple fact enables us to estimate that

the RD contributes ∼40% of the system’s radio emission, while the remaining ∼60%

is generated by the reconnection emission model described in §4. Similarly, the orbital

modulation of the circular polarization fraction presents clues as to the location where

cyclotron emission may arise. This fraction is maximal near φorb ∼ −0.1, when the

observing geometry favors an unobstructed view of the RD hemisphere nearest the WD and

the magnetospheric interaction region. Thus, these considerations support our model of

magnetospheric interactions causing the nonthermal acceleration of electrons, which in the

RD magnetosphere, result in additional cyclotron emission superimposed on intrinsic RD

stellar ﬂaring.

5. AE Aqr system and other polars

AE Aqr (Patterson 1979; Wynn et al. 1997; de Jager et al. 1994) is the most rapidly

rotating white dwarf known (Prot = 33.08 s); it is also the most strongly asynchronous

object (Porb = 9.88 hr) in the DQ Herculis class. AE Aqr is classiﬁed as a DQ Herculis-type

– 30 –

cataclysmic variable, comprising a magnetized white dwarf primary and a K5 dwarf

secondary. AE Aqr is characterized by coherent pulsations and quasi-periodic oscillations

(QPOs) in the optical, UV, and soft X-ray wavelength bands. Although early work

suggested that it is a source of 0.35-2.4 TeV γ-rays, later results from MAGIC and the

FERMI Large Area Telescope (LAT) failed to conﬁrm these purported detections (Meintjes

et al. 1992; Aleksi´c et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016). In addition, AE Aqr displays violent ﬂaring

activity at optical, soft X-ray, and radio wavelengths.

We note in particular how the radio emission from AE Aqr diﬀers from that found

from AR Sco. Non-simultaneous, VLA observations of AE Aqr at 1.4, 4.9, 15, and 22.5

GHz revealed radio emission that varied on timescales of ∼5 min, with greater variability

detected at higher frequencies (Bookbinder & Lamb 1987; Bastian et al. 1988). No circular

polarization was detected to within instrumental uncertainty ((cid:46)15%) and the spectral

index was found to vary from α ∼ −1 to 1.5. These results led Bookbinder & Lamb (1987)

to suggest that synchrotron radiation from a mildly relativistic population of electrons

(γ ∼ 3) caused the radio emission, with the WD acting as an injector of electrons that are

conﬁned within the magnetic bottle of the secondary’s strong magnetic ﬁeld. Alternatively,

Bastian et al. (1988) argued that the radio emission represented the superposition of almost

continually occurring synchrotron ﬂares.

Let us apply the model to the AE Aqr. From (2) the required accretion rate during the

spin-up stage is

˙M = 4π

W DΩ7/3

(GMW D)5/3 =






10−7B2

W D,6

for AR Sco

10−6B2

W D,6

for AE Aqr

(36)

Thus, smaller

˙M is required for AE Aqr during the high stage; equivalently, its magnetic

ﬁeld can be somewhat higher. Our conclusion about the properties of AE Aqr are, generally,

in agreement with those reached by Blinova et al. (2019).

– 31 –

Thus, the model places AR Sco (and AE Aqr) within a short-lived phase of IPs, with

a very IP-like magnetic ﬁeld strength. The AR Sco stage is short, ∼ 106 − 107 yrs. Since,

typically, the IP phase lasts ∼ 109 years, several transitions to such a state can occur during

the system’s lifetime.

What distinguishes AR Sco and AE Aqr from other intermediate polars? IPs typically

have magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 107 G and are accreting. We suggest: (i) AR Sco and AE Aqr

have smaller magnetic ﬁelds: the equilibrium spin is inversely proportional to the surface

magnetic ﬁeld (for a given ˙M ) - from (2) Ω ∝ ˙M 3/7B−6/7

W D . Thus, small WD surface ﬁelds

allow for faster equilibrium spin during the spin-up stage (low magnetic ﬁeld in AE Aqr

was also proposed by Warner 2004); (ii) currently AR Sco and AE Aqr are in a propeller

regime due to their low accretion rates.

The present model also can be related to the “hibernating intermediate polar” model of

Warner (2002), which proposes that the mass lost by the WD during a nova will cause the

secondary to detach from its Roche lobe. The mass-transfer rate then drops to extremely

low levels for very long periods of time. But before the system enters hibernation, there

is a brief interval of enhanced mass transfer, caused by the irradiation of the secondary.

Thus, various states of the system would involve: (i) high ˙M , accretion, spin-up; (ii) nova

explosion, ejection of material; (iii) on Kelvin time scales the companion relaxes to a new

detached state, and becomes a hibernating intermediate polar with very small

˙M .

6. Discussion

We develop a model of the highly asynchronous intermediate polars AR Sco and AE

Aqr. The magnetic ﬁelds of the WDs are relatively weak, ∼ 107 G. They are currently

in a transient propeller stage. The weak magnetic ﬁelds allowed a system to be in the

– 32 –

accretor state during previous high mass transfer stage. As the WDs are spinning down

quickly, each will eventually be in a double synchronous state like AM Herculis (Joss

et al. 1979). The propeller stage in AR Sco does not even involve formation of the disk,

but direct magnetospheric interaction with the companion. The fast spin-down of the

WDs is determined by loading of the RD’s material and ensuing expulsion from the WDs’

magnetospheres in a transient propeller regime. If the mass accretion rate remains small,

as it is now, each system will become synchronous and eventually will start accreting (this

regime was studied numerically by Zhilkin et al. 2012; Isakova et al. 2019; Zhilkin et al.

2019). But if

˙M increases, they will enter the earlier accretor regime.

In both systems, the mass loading of the WD’s magnetosphere by the partially ionized

RD’s stream is strongly aﬀected by the ionizing radiation from the WD. It leads to eﬃcient

loading of the WD’s magnetosphere needed to explain the high spin-down rate. The

ionization conditions, we hypothesize, are what make the AR Sco and AE Aqr diﬀerent:

in our model the ionization of the RD’s ﬂow by the WD is important, this diﬀerence in

temperatures might aﬀect the ﬂow dynamics, as discussed at the end of Section 3.2.

We envision that most of the observed properties are determined by the direct

interaction of the stars’ magnetospheres. This requires that the Alfv´en points in the

corresponding winds are further way from the stars than the L1 point. This is easily

achieved for the RD, since it is almost Roche lobe ﬁlling; in the case of WD it is required

the the Alfv´en velocity in the magnetosphere is larger that vA ≥ (aΩW D) ≈ 0.1c. The

magnetospheric/wind interaction of two stars is not responsible for the WD’s spin-down:

it leads to the generation of the observed nonthermal emission by particles accelerated in

reconnection events.

Finally, we point out that conventional models of spin and orbital evolution may have

to be corrected in the case of AR Sco and AE Aqr. Interaction of the WD’s and RD’s

– 33 –

magnetospheres also lead to a torque on the RD (Paczy´nski 1967; Verbunt & Zwaan 1981).

Changing the spin of the RD, combined with the spin-orbital tidal synchronization, and the

corresponding loss of the orbital angular momentum and the size of the RD’s Roche lobe,

will lead to changes in the mass accretion rate. Using (12), we can estimate the mutual

torque as

˙J = −

1
4

µW DµRD
a3

= 1033erg

(37)

for the parameters of AR Sco. This is the torque exerted on the RD due to magnetospheric

interaction with the WD. This comes close to the general relativistic torque, which for the

parameters of AR Sco, evaluates to 1034 erg. (In fact, Eq. (37) underestimates the torque,

since it is applied at rint < a.) We leave consideration of these eﬀects to a subsequent paper.
