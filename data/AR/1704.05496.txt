ABSTRACT

We investigate the coronal and interplanetary evolution of a coronal mass ejection (CME) launched on 2010 Septem-
ber 4 from a source region linking two active regions (ARs) 11101 and 11103, using extreme ultraviolet imaging,
magnetogram, white-light and in situ observations from SDO, STEREO, SOHO, VEX and Wind. A potential-ﬁeld
source-surface model is employed to examine the conﬁguration of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the source
region. The graduated cylindrical shell model and a triangulation method are applied to determine the kinematics of
the CME in the corona and interplanetary space. From the remote sensing and in situ observations we obtain some key
results: (1) the CME was deﬂected in both the eastward and southward directions in the low corona by the magnetic
pressure from the two ARs and possibly interacted with another ejection, which caused that the CME arrived at VEX
that was longitudinally distant from the source region; (2) although VEX was closer to the Sun, the observed and
derived CME arrival times at VEX are not earlier than those at Wind, which suggests the importance of determining
both the frontal shape and propagation direction of the CME in interplanetary space; (3) the ICME was compressed
in the radial direction while the longitudinal transverse size was extended.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large expulsions of plasma and rapid releases of magnetic ﬁeld energy from the
solar atmosphere. They are called interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) when propagating in interplanetary space, which are
one of the major disturbances in the solar wind. ICMEs are also signiﬁcant factors inducing geomagnetic activities
when they impact the Earth. From the low corona to interplanetary space, a CME may experience non-radial motion,
interact with other CMEs and be deformed due to the interaction with the ambient solar wind, involving plenty of
physical processes.

The conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the source region as well as the interaction with other structures
in the solar wind are important for estimating the propagation direction of a CME and thus crucial for space weather
forecasting. Previous coronagraph observations suggested that latitudinal deﬂections of CMEs were controlled by
the background coronal magnetic ﬁeld and the overall ﬂow near solar minimum (MacQueen et al. 1986), which was
conﬁrmed by the result that CMEs near solar minimum were systematically deﬂected toward lower latitudes while
CMEs during solar maximum could deviate toward either the pole or equator (e.g., Cremades & Bothmer 2004;
Kilpua et al. 2009). Some CMEs were found to be deﬂected toward the weak magnetic ﬁeld region associated with
the streamer belt or the heliospheric current sheet (e.g., Xie et al. 2009; Kay et al. 2013; Liewer et al. 2015), while Xie
et al. (2009) reported that fast CMEs could be deﬂected away from the streamer belt. The coronal hole with strong
open magnetic ﬁeld is one important factor that can divert a CME (e.g., Gopalswamy et al. 2004, 2005, 2009; Xie
et al. 2009; Panasenco et al. 2013). M¨ostl et al. (2015) and Wang et al. (2015) found that the strong magnetic ﬁeld
of a sunspot in an active region (AR) and the conﬁgurations of the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the source region play
a signiﬁcant role in channeling the CME. Deﬂection of CMEs in the corona is likely to occur within a few solar radii
from the Sun (e.g., Isavnin et al. 2014; Kay et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015), while CME-CME interaction may change
the propagation direction of a CME in interplanetary space (e.g., Gopalswamy et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2012, 2014; Lugaz
et al. 2012).

A plethora of eﬀorts have been made to understand the morphology of the CME in the corona and interplanetary
space, which is crucial to determine the arrival time of the CME at a planet. Thernisien et al. (2006, 2009) presented
the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model employing a croissant-like empirical ﬂux-rope structure to describe the
morphology of the CME near the Sun. A compact structure was used to derive CME kinematics (e.g., Sheeley et al.
1999). A circle attached to the Sun, called the harmonic mean method, was also applied to determine the kinematics
in the inner heliosphere (e.g., Lugaz et al. 2009). A self-similar expansion (SSE) geometry with an expanding circle
in the ecliptic plane was adopted to describe the CME front (Lugaz et al. 2010; Davies et al. 2012; M¨ostl & Davies
2013). M¨ostl et al. (2015) and Rollett et al. (2016) introduced an elliptical shape with a constant angular width to
forecast CME arrival time and speed based on single-viewpoint imaging observations. The readers are directed to Liu
et al. (2010b) for discussions of some of the geometries. However, a CME could be deformed by interacting with the
ambient solar wind (e.g., Riley et al. 2003; Odstrcil et al. 2004; Manchester et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2006; Savani et al.
2010), as well as structures in the solar wind (e.g., Lugaz et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2012, 2015; Kataoka et al. 2015). These
interactions can alter their plasma and magnetic ﬁeld characteristics as well as morphologies in interplanetary space.
In this manuscript we investigate the coronal and interplanetary evolution of a CME launched from a source region
linking two ARs. The eruption may occur as a result of magnetic coupling of the two ARs, but it is diﬀerent from
the cases of sympathetic eruptions (e.g., Schrijver & Title 2011; Jin et al. 2016). The remote sensing and in situ
observations from SDO, STEREO, SOHO, VEX and Wind are used in this study. The positions of the spacecraft and
planets during the event are indicated in Figure 1. STEREO A was ∼81◦ ahead of the Earth and was ∼20◦ west of
the source region (∼W62◦), and STEREO B was ∼74◦ behind the Earth. VEX (Venus) was ∼0.73 au from the Sun
and ∼31◦ east of the Earth. The spacecraft are at positions that are advantageous for investigating the kinematics
and the structure of the CME. The study illustrates how the magnetic ﬁeld of the two ARs on one side of the source
region change the motion of the CME near the Sun. The multi-spacecraft in situ measurements and remote sensing
observations place constraints on the structure and the kinematics of the CME, and demonstrate how the frontal shape
and propagation direction determine the arrival time of the CME. Furthermore, multiple spacecraft at longitudinally
separated positions reveal the longitudinal transverse size of the ICME, which is important for understanding the
structure and distortion of the ICME in the solar wind. The evolution of the CME in the corona and interplanetary
space is presented in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. We conclude and discuss the results in Section 4. The results of
this work shed light on the kinematics and morphological evolution of the CME in the inner heliosphere as well as
space weather forecasting.

2. EVOLUTION IN THE CORONA

The CME was launched around 14:30 UT on 2010 September 4 in the rising phase of solar cycle 24, associated
with two roughly straight ﬂare ribbons on the eastern edges of two ARs 11101 (W67◦N11◦) and 11103 (W69◦N26◦),
as shown in the right panel of Figure 2. Figure 2 displays the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and magnetograms
about the source region from SDO and STEREO A. In the magnetograms, the white (dark) regions represent the
positive (negative) magnetic ﬁeld regions, and the locations of ARs 11103, 11101 and 11102 are marked with “A”, “B”
and “C”, respectively. According to the EUV observations of SDO/AIA (Lemen et al. 2012) and STEREO A/EUVI
(Howard et al. 2008), the ribbons became visible at wavelength 304 ˚A at about 14:16 UT and separated eastward and
westward, respectively. From the SDO/HMI (Schou et al. 2012) magnetogram overlaid with the intensity contour of
the AIA 304 ˚A image, the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to the eastern ribbon is positive and the magnetic ﬁeld for
the western ribbon is negative. The neutral line between the two ribbons is along the meridian and at a longitude of
∼W62◦ (∼77◦ in Carrington longitudes). Viewing from the viewpoint of STEREO A, a potential-ﬁeld source-surface
(PFSS) model reveals an overlying loop structure above the two ﬂare ribbons as shown in the lower right panel of
Figure 2. The associated loop brightening during the eruption was also observed at wavelength 195 ˚A by STEREO
A/EUVI (not shown here). A hot channel, which is considered as an erupting ﬂux rope (e.g., Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng
et al. 2014), is not observed in the EUV images. However, an eruption with a two-ribbon ﬂare and loop brightening
is considered evidence of an erupting ﬂux rope (e.g., Amari et al. 2000; Qiu et al. 2004). In our case, an erupting ﬂux
rope could be inferred from the ﬂare ribbons and the loop brightening, which was lying over the neutral line between
the two ribbons. The erupting ﬂux rope probably was of low twist because the magnetic ﬁeld near the neutral line
was relatively weak and not strongly sheared. As can be inferred from the combined EUV and HMI observations in
the upper right panel of Figure 2, the erupting ﬂux rope likely extended from the positive polarity region of AR 11103
(marked with “A”) in the north to the negative polarity region of AR 11101 (marked with “B”) in the south. The
source region of the CME was expected to be between the two ribbons and adjacent to the eastern edges of the two
ARs. ARs 11103 and 11101 are separated by ∼15◦ in latitudes but may be connected through the erupting ﬂux rope
that is under the PFFS model revealed loop structure. The maximum magnitude of the HMI measured magnetic ﬁeld
in AR 11101 is about 2100 gauss, and the one in AR 11103 is about 1600 gauss. M¨ostl et al. (2015) and Wang et al.
(2015) reported that the strong magnetic ﬁeld (over 3000 gauss) of a nearby sunspot could change the propagation
direction of the CME near the Sun. In our case, although the magnetic ﬁeld is not so high, the asymmetric magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration close to the source region may also interfere the motion of the CME in the corona.

Figure 3 shows the magnetic energy density distribution surrounding the CME source region at heights of 1.75 and
2.25 R(cid:12). The magnetic energy density wB is calculated from wB = B2/2µ0, where the magnetic ﬁeld B is from
the PFSS extrapolation and µ0 is the vacuum permeability. In Figure 3, the two vertical dashed lines indicate the
approximate positions of the two ribbons, and the source region is between them. For the sake of simplicity, we use
contours of the magnetic energy density to infer the general direction of the gradient descent. As displayed in the upper
panel of Figure 3, the contour reveals that the gradient descent of the magnetic energy density near the source region
is generally eastward at the height of 1.75 R(cid:12). As shown in the lower panel of the ﬁgure, the gradient descent near the
source region at the height of 2.25 R(cid:12) has a southward component. ARs 11103, 11101 and 11102 marked with diamond
symbols in Figure 3 are generally in the regions of higher magnetic energy density on the west side of the source region.
This implies that ARs 11103, 11101 and possibly 11102 caused an asymmetric magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration near the
source region. Previous studies suggested that an asymmetric conﬁguration of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld could deﬂect
a CME toward the weak magnetic ﬁeld region (e.g., MacQueen et al. 1986; Kilpua et al. 2009; Kay et al. 2015; Wang
et al. 2015). We use the GCS model developed by Thernisien et al. (2006, 2009) to investigate the propagation direction
near the Sun, and ﬁnd that the propagation direction of the CME at 6.15 R(cid:12) (marked with a square in Figure 3)
is in the southeast of the source region, which is consistent with the general direction of the gradient descent of the
magnetic energy density. The GCS modeling will be detailed in the text below.

The GCS model can determine the height, direction and other parameters of the CME in the corona based on the
coronagraph observations from STEREO/SECCHI (Howard et al. 2008) and SOHO/LASCO (Domingo et al. 1995).
Two coronagraphs are on board each STEREO spacecraft (Kaiser et al. 2008), of which COR1 has a ﬁeld of view
(FOV) of 1.5–4 R(cid:12) and COR2 has a FOV of 2.5–15 R(cid:12) (Howard et al. 2008). Coronagraph C2 on board SOHO has
a FOV of 1.5–6 R(cid:12) and C3 has a FOV of 3–30 R(cid:12) (Domingo et al. 1995). Multi-spacecraft coronagraph observations
from three viewpoints place strong constraints on the parameters of the GCS model. The CME appeared in the
FOV of STEREO B /COR1 at 15:05 UT, SOHO/C2 (from position angle PA ∼270◦) at 15:12 UT, and STEREO

4

A/COR1 at 15:37 UT. Running diﬀerence coronagraph images from SOHO, STEREO A and B as shown in Figure 4
are used to ﬁt the GCS model parameters of the CME. In every two rows of Figure 4, two sets of identical running
diﬀerence images are presented, where the GCS modeled CME (green grids) are superimposed on the second set of
images. In the running diﬀerence images of the top two rows of the ﬁgure, we see that the CME was about to enter the
FOV of STEREO A/COR1 at 15:25 UT when it was clearly observed by STEREO B /COR1 and SOHO/C2. This
strongly restricts the CME propagation direction at that moment with the GCS model, because an underestimated
angle between the Sun-Earth line and the propagation direction will bring the modeled CME (the green grids) into
the FOV of STEREO A/COR1 then. In the middle two rows of Figure 4, the running diﬀerence image of SOHO/C2
shows a loop-like structure in the northwest of the CME. This structure may be a substructure of the CME, and it is
not ﬁtted during the GCS model. However, the possibility that the loop-like structure is of another CME cannot be
excluded. The front of the CME was distorted and the southern part moved faster than the part above the ecliptic
plane as displayed in the images of the bottom two rows of Figure 4. The distortion cannot be ﬁtted by changing the
tilt-angle parameter of the GCS model. Only the part of the CME front near and above the ecliptic plane is ﬁtted
by the GCS model when the distortion is signiﬁcant. The distortion may be caused by a streamer interacting with
the southern part of the CME from the behind, which can be seen in STEREO/COR2 white-light observations (not
shown here). At each time, tilt-angle, aspect-ratio, half-angle and latitude parameters of the GCS model are ﬁxed
while only the longitude and height parameters are ﬁtted.

The ﬁtted parameters of the GCS model and their corresponding times are given in Table 1. The propagation
direction of the CME at height 3.00 R(cid:12) obtained from the GCS model was 60.◦4 west of the Sun-Earth line.
It
was close to the longitude (∼W62◦) of the source region estimated from the EUV and HMI observations. The angle
between the propagation direction and the Sun-Earth line decreased remarkably to 48.◦1 when the CME height reached
6.15 R(cid:12), and then gradually changed to 45.◦8 when the height was 17.57 R(cid:12). During the whole GCS process, the
tilt-angle parameter is set to 90◦ that is consistent with the observed meridian-aligned ﬂare ribbons. The constant tilt
angle shows that the CME did not apparently rotate near the Sun. The other three parameters are slightly adjusted
according to the data times, and the changes of aspect ratio and half angle could be explained by the expansion of the
ﬂux rope. Zuccarello et al. (2012) reported that a CME could be deﬂected latitudinally about 15◦ toward the equator
within ∼3.5 R(cid:12). The roughly constant latitude (around 0◦) in Table 1 indicates that the CME in our manuscript had
been diverted over 10◦ southward from the location of source region (∼W62◦N15◦ as indicated with the two vertical
lines in Figure 3) before reaching the height of 3 R(cid:12). The GCS modeling results also show that the CME was deﬂected
over 10◦ eastward at the height of 6.15 R(cid:12). The CME propagation direction at 6.15 R(cid:12) is roughly in the southeast
of the source region, which is near the regions of lower magnetic energy density as shown in Figure 3. The deﬂection
direction of the CME in the low corona is roughly consistent with the distribution of the magnetic energy density.
The direction variation of the CME revealed by the GCS model is minor above 6.15 R(cid:12) as shown in Table 1, which is
consistent with that the rate of CME deﬂection caused by the coronal magnetic ﬁeld is more signiﬁcant within a few
solar radii (e.g., Isavnin et al. 2014; Kay et al. 2015).

3. PROPERTIES IN INTERPLANETARY SPACE

The interplanetary kinematics of the CME is derived through a geometric triangulation technique initially proposed
by Liu et al. (2010a) based on stereoscopic wide-angle imaging observations from STEREO. The triangulation method
ﬁrst utilizes a Fixed β (Fβ) geometry for the CME front, which assumes a relatively compact structure (Sheeley et al.
1999; Kahler & Webb 2007) simultaneously observed by two separated spacecraft. Later, Lugaz et al. (2010) and Liu
et al. (2010b) incorporated a harmonic mean (HM) approximation, which assumes that the CME front is a sphere
attached to the Sun and tangent to the lines of sight of the two spacecraft. The triangulation concept has proved
to work well in acquiring CME interplanetary kinematics and in connecting remote sensing observations with in situ
signatures (e.g., Liu et al. 2010a,b, 2013, 2016; Lugaz et al. 2010; M¨ostl et al. 2010; Harrison et al. 2012; Davies et al.
2013; Hu et al. 2016). The triangulation technique with Fβ and HM approximations is detailed and discussed in Liu
et al. (2010b, 2013, 2016).

The elongations and times as inputs of the triangulation method are from the observations of STEREO COR2, HI1
and HI2. The angular FOV is 0.◦7–4◦ around the Sun for COR2, 20◦ × 20◦ centered at 14◦ from the center of the Sun
for HI1, and 70◦ in diameter centered at 53.◦7 for HI2 (Howard et al. 2008). The left panel of Figure 5 depicts the
running diﬀerence images of the CME in interplanetary space taken by HI1 and HI2 of STEREO A and B . The feature
near the northern edge of the CME in the HI1 images might be the substructure of the CME that is also observed by

5

SOHO/C2. We cannot rule out the possibility that the feature is of another CME. The northern front of the CME was
distorted and the southern part of the front was advancing the other part. Through stacking the running diﬀerence
intensities of COR2, HI1, and HI2 within a slit along the ecliptic plane, we construct two time-elongation maps (J-
maps, e.g., Sheeley et al. 1999) for the CME as shown in the right panel of Figure 5. The red curves in the maps
represent the elongation angles of the CME front near the ecliptic plane observed from the viewpoints of STEREO A
and B , respectively. STEREO A tracked the CME out to ∼50◦ while STEREO B followed the CME out to ∼40◦, as
indicated by the red curves. The elongations and times are extracted and used as inputs of the triangulation method.
The CME kinematics along the ecliptic plane derived from the Fβ and HM triangulations will be compared with the
in situ observations. The trajectories of the CME derived from the triangulation with the Fβ and HM approximations,
as well as the positions of the spacecraft in the ecliptic plane during the event are displayed in Figure 1. The black
diamonds and red crosses in Figure 1 represent the trajectory of the CME apex in the ecliptic plane derived from the
Fβ and HM triangulations, respectively. The green and blue circles represent the sizes of the HM assumed spherical
front when the CME arrives at Wind and VEX , respectively. The arrows indicate the directions of the apex when the
CME arrives the two spacecraft.

The propagation direction, height and speed of the CME in the ecliptic plane derived from the triangulation method
and the kinematics in the corona obtained from the GCS model are presented in Figure 6. In the top panel of the
ﬁgure, the derived propagation direction is given in degrees from the Sun-Earth line. The direction angle acquired
from the HM triangulation is roughly twice the one from the Fβ triangulation and more variational, which is noticed
in previous studies (Lugaz et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2013, 2016). Near the Sun the longitude is overestimated by the HM
approximation which is probably a result of the overestimated CME size as discussed in Liu et al. (2013, 2016). Both
the GCS model and the Fβ triangulation reveal that the CME was propagating to the east of the source region, and
the direction changed dramatically toward the east in the low corona. The direction angles from the GCS model are
between those from the Fβ and HM approximations. The direction angles from the GCS model are closer to those
from the Fβ approximation at lower heights, and have a trend to approach to those from the HM approximation
at larger heights. The CME was deﬂected from about 60◦ to about 50◦ west of the Sun-Earth line below ∼6 R(cid:12).
The diﬀerence between the propagation directions before and after the data gap in the top panel of Figure 6 implies
that the CME may continue to turn eastward in interplanetary space. The ﬁnal propagation direction angle before
reaching the Earth is likely around 20◦ west of the Sun-Earth line, to which both the Fβ and HM triangulations seem
to converge. Given these variations in the propagation direction, the CME possibly arrived at Venus (VEX ) that was
longitudinally ∼90◦ distant from the source region (see the text below). There were other ejections launched near
AR 11103 and 11102 on September 4, which were all on the west side of the CME of interest. One of these ejections
may interact with the CME, which is likely to be the reason for the direction change of the CME in interplanetary
space. As shown in the middle and bottom panels of Figure 6, the GCS model and the triangulation method give
consistent distances and speeds of the CME below ∼20 R(cid:12). The distances and speeds from the Fβ approximation
slightly deviate from those from the HM approximation beyond ∼130 R(cid:12), which is probably due to the limitation of
the geometric assumption for the Fβ approximation at larger distances as discussed in Liu et al. (2013, 2016). Below
∼30 R(cid:12), the CME was gradually accelerated to about 600 km s−1. Due to the data gap we cannot tell if there is a
deceleration process, but the speeds beyond ∼60 R(cid:12) do not show much variation (∼620 km s−1 for Fβ approximation
and ∼530 km s−1 for HM approximation as marked in Figure 1).

Figure 7 shows the solar wind magnetic ﬁeld measurements from the VEX magnetometer (Zhang et al. 2006),
where the ICME (with an interval of ∼7.5 hr from 11:04 UT to 18:33 UT on September 8) is reported by Good &
Forsyth (2016). The high ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld at lower altitudes was probably caused by the induced
magnetosphere of Venus. VEX was at a distance of ∼0.73 au with a longitude of ∼−31◦ that was over 90◦ away from
the source region. The distance data range of the CME derived from the observed elongations using the triangulation
method is not large enough to estimate the arrival times of the CME front at VEX and Wind . Assuming a ﬁxed
propagation direction (∼17◦ from the Sun-Earth line for Fβ and ∼24◦ for HM) outside the data range, we use a linear
ﬁt of the distances determined by the triangulations to estimate the arrival times of the CME at VEX and Wind .
The HM triangulation suggests that the eastern ﬂank of the CME (the eastern part of the blue circle attached to the
Sun in Figure 1) arrived at VEX around 15:53 UT on September 8, about 5 hr later than the start time of the ICME
observed at VEX , with a radial speed at VEX of ∼310 km s−1. Assuming that the compact structure for the Fβ
approximation is the dominant apex and the CME front is also a circle attached to the Sun like the HM approximation,
we estimate the arrival time at VEX , using the Fβ derived directions and distances, to be 20:52 UT on September 7,

6

about 14 hr earlier than the observed ICME start time. The HM triangulation has well predicted the arrival times of
ICMEs in comparison to the in situ observed start times of the ICMEs (e.g., Liu et al. 2010b, 2016). In our case, the
small diﬀerence between the HM triangulation derived arrival times and the ICME start time suggests that the VEX
observed ICME shown in Figure 7 is the interplanetary counterpart of the CME of interest.

The associated in situ measurements at Wind during the event are displayed in Figure 8. Two ICME-like structures
are indicated with “I1” and “I2” in the ﬁgure, one of which may be associated with the CME of interest. Although the
alpha-to-proton density ratio is below the threshold for a typical ICME (e.g., Richardson & Cane 2004; Liu et al. 2005),
the duration of structure I1 (∼6 hr from 19:42 UT on September 7 to 1:39 UT on September 8) can be determined by
a combination of the increase of the alpha-to-proton density ratio, the low proton temperature (Richardson & Cane
1995) and the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle. Structure I2 has an interval of ∼15.5 hr (from 10:15 UT on September 8 to 1:52
UT on September 9), whose trailing edge may be ambiguous. The HM approximation determines the arrival time
of the CME at Wind to around 03:23 UT on September 8 and the estimated radial speed is ∼490 km s−1. The Fβ
approximation gives an arrival time around 18:17 UT on September 7. The HM estimated arrival time is ∼8 hr later
than the start time of structure I1, and is ∼7 hr earlier than the start time of I2. The Fβ estimated arrival time is ∼1
hr earlier than the start time of I1, and is ∼16 hr earlier than the start time of I2. Given the small diﬀerence between
the estimated and observed arrival times, it is diﬃcult to determine which of the two ICME-like structures (I1 and
I2) is associated with the CME of interest. There was a brief structure (from 12:18 UT to 16:26 UT on September 9)
after structure I2, which is likely irrelevant to the CME of interest because of its late start time.

Figure 9 shows the in situ measurements at STEREO A during the event. On September 7 STEREO A observed a
shock leading an ICME with the arrival time of 8:29 UT. The ICME interval is from around 13:00 UT on September
7 to around 9:45 UT on September 8, which is determined from the combination of the low-temperature region and
magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle. Both the shock arrival time and the ICME start time are over 80 (60) hr earlier than the Fβ
(HM) estimated arrival time. Although the triangulation assumed shape may deviate from the real geometry of the
CME, the large diﬀerence between the estimated and observed arrival times can hardly associate the STEREO A
observed ICME with the CME of interest. This is also consistent with the statement in the ICME catalog of Good &
Forsyth (2016) that no in situ ICME signatures observed at STEREO A were likely to be associated with the ICME
at VEX in Figure 7. A couple of ejections were launched from source regions longitudinally close to STEREO A on
September 4. The STEREO A observed ICME might be associated with one of these ejections, which might interact
with the CME of interest and caused the latter to continue turning eastward in interplanetary space.

The HM approximation estimated arrival times of the CME at VEX and Wind are generally consistent with the
observed, even though the ICME at Wind cannot be uniquely associated with the CME of interest. This seems to
suggest that the assumed spherical geometry is applicable to the eastern part of the CME front in this case. The in
situ measurements and the triangulation method both reveal that the arrival time of the CME at Venus (VEX ) is
not earlier than that at the Earth (Wind ), although the Sun-Venus distance (∼0.73 au) was less than the Sun-Earth
distance. This is exactly what is shown in Figure 1: the expanding eastern ﬂank of the assumed CME circle touches
VEX after the front reaches Wind . Therefore the arrival times of the CME at the two spacecraft with diﬀerent
heliocentric distances can be determined by the joint eﬀect of the propagation direction and the assumed expanding
circular shape. However, it is unclear whether the assumed shape could describe the geometry of the western part of
the CME because of the lack of consistent in situ measurement of the western part. Assuming that the CME front
is symmetric with respect to the ﬁnal propagation direction, we estimate the longitudinal angular width of the CME
front to be probably no less than 100◦ given that the angular distance between VEX and the propagation direction
is ∼50◦. Let the semi-perimeter of the circle (the leading edge of the ﬂux rope) in the HM approximation represent
the longitudinal transverse size, and we estimate the size to be about 1.7 au when the CME arrived at Wind. The
radial widths of structures I1 and I2 at Wind (as indicated in Figure 8), obtained from the HM estimated radial speeds
multiplied by the durations, are ∼0.07 au and ∼0.18 au, respectively. Both the radial widths of structures I1 and I2
are far less than the transverse size ∼1.7 au. Note that the ﬂux rope is generally perpendicular to the ecliptic plane
as can be seen from Section 2, so the transverse size is approximately equal to the transverse size of the cross section
of the ﬂux rope in the ecliptic plane. This result suggests that the ICME structure was extremely compressed in the
radial direction and extended in the longitudinal direction in interplanetary space.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

We have investigated a CME launched on 2010 September 4 from a source region connecting AR 11101 and AR
11103, based on EUV, magnetogram, white-light and in situ observations from SDO, STEREO, SOHO, VEX and
Wind. The PFSS model is used to examine the magnetic ﬁeld environment near the source region. The GCS model
and the triangulation method are applied to analyze the kinematics and structure in the corona and interplanetary
space. Below we summarize the results and discuss their crucial implications for understanding: 1) how the propagation
direction of the CME in the low corona is changed by the asymmetric magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration caused by the ARs
on one side of the source region; 2) the determination of both the CME frontal shape and the propagation direction
in space weather forecasting; and 3) the deformation of the ICME structure.

1. The CME was deﬂected in the low corona by the magnetic pressure from the two nearby ARs in the west,
and possibly interacted with another CME in interplanetary space. The erupting ﬂux rope originated from the
positive and negative polarity regions belonging to the two diﬀerent ARs. With all the sunspots on the west side,
the source region was adjacent to the eastern edges of the two ARs, which caused an asymmetric magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration on the two sides of the eruption and resulted in a deﬂection of the CME in the low corona. The
deﬂection direction revealed by the GCS model is consistent with the general direction of the gradient descent of
the magnetic energy density derived from the PFSS model. This suggests that a CME originated from the edge
of an AR is likely to be deﬂected toward a non-radial motion due to the asymmetric background magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration. This is similar to the case of M¨ostl et al. (2015) and Wang et al. (2015) where the strong magnetic
ﬁeld on one side of the CME source region changed the propagation direction of the CME. However, a CME-CME
interaction is possibly involved in the change of propagation direction. Given that there were other ejections with
close launch times and source regions to those of the CME of interest, the CME possibly interacted with one of
these ejections during the propagation. The deﬂection and interaction may be the reason that caused the CME
to reach VEX that was longitudinally distant from the source region. CME-CME interaction is not unusual
and may change the propagation direction and 1-au property of a CME (e.g., Gopalswamy et al. 2001; Lugaz
et al. 2009, 2012; Liu et al. 2012, 2014, 2015). This illustrates the necessity of considering both the background
magnetic ﬁeld condition and successive eruptions near the source region in determining the propagation direction
of a CME.

2. It is important to determine both the frontal shape and the propagation direction of the CME in interplanetary
space for space weather forecasting. Although the associated ICME at Wind cannot be uniquely identiﬁed from
the two plausible structures, the HM triangulation with a circular geometry in the ecliptic plane can give arrival
times that are less than 8 hr diﬀerent from observed at VEX and Wind . Both the observed and the triangulation
estimated arrival times of the CME at VEX (∼0.73 au) are not earlier than those at Wind (∼1 au), although
VEX was closer to the Sun than Wind. These results suggest that the simple expanding sphere attached to the
Sun may describe the shape of the eastern CME front in the inner heliosphere. However, the spherical shape is
only consistent with in situ measurements at two points, and there is no consistent observations of the western
part of the CME. The real geometry of the CME front is not strongly constrained. Furthermore, the CME could
be distorted to a complex geometry so that it arrived at VEX later. Also note that the HM triangulation gives
a misleading propagation direction near the Sun and large variations in the propagation direction. The CME
touched VEX with its eastern ﬂank in this case, and the ﬂank of a CME could also trigger a geomagnetic storm
as reported by M¨ostl et al. (2010). This indicates the importance of determining both the CME frontal shape
and propagation direction in forecasting geomagnetic activity.

3. The structure of the CME in interplanetary space was compressed radially and extended longitudinally, leading
to a large transverse size of the ﬂux-rope cross section in the ecliptic plane. Estimate of the transverse size
and deformation of the ICME structure in the inner heliosphere could be helpful to improve our knowledge of
the interaction between the ICME and the solar wind as well as space weather forecasting. For example, the
transverse size can increase the contact area of the interaction between an ICME and the solar wind and the
probability of arriving at the Earth, while the deformation could alter the interplanetary plasma and magnetic
ﬁeld properties of an ICME near the Earth. Observations from the Solar Orbiter (M¨uller et al. 2013) out of the
ecliptic plane can be of great advantage to study the kinematics and geometric evolution of CMEs, as well as
their interactions with other structures in the solar wind.
