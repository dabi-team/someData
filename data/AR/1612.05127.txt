GRAPH PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE OF PROPERTY (AR)

NICOLAI STAMMEIER

Abstract. We discuss the internal structure of graph products of right LCM semi-
groups and prove that there is an abundance of examples without property (AR).
Thereby we provide the ﬁrst examples of right LCM semigroups lacking this seemingly
common feature. The results are particularly sharp for right-angled Artin monoids.

1. Introduction

The starting point of a number of recent breakthroughs in the theory of semigroup
C ∗-algebras is the seminal work [Li12, Li13], in which a universal C ∗-algebra C ∗(S) is
associated to every left cancellative monoid S. In the last years, a particular line of
research focused on left cancellative monoids for which the intersection of two principal
right ideals is either empty, or another principal right ideal again. Such monoids are
called right LCM semigroups, and they form an intriguing and tractable class of examples
in between positive cones in quasi-lattice ordered groups and general left cancellative
monoids, see [BLS17, Lemma 3.3 and Corollary 3.6] for details.

Inspired by the treatment of the quasi-lattice ordered case in [CL07], a boundary
quotient Q(S) of C ∗(S) was introduced for right LCM semigroups S in [BRRW14]. Soon
thereafter, Starling provided an in-depth analysis of Q(S) in [Star15], relying on major
advances in the understanding of the connections between inverse semigroups, groupoids,
and C ∗-algebras stemming from [EP17, EP16, Ste16]. In [BS16], it was shown that the
boundary quotient has a more accessible presentation if the right LCM semigroup has
the so-called accurate reﬁnement property, henceforth abbreviated property (AR). This
property is an analogue of 0-dimensionality for topological spaces in the context of
semigroups, and is enjoyed by various examples, see [BS16, Section 2 and Corollary 3.11].
The presence of property (AR) was found to be useful in the construction of a bound-
ary quotient diagram for right LCM semigroups in the spirit of [BaHLR12], see [Sta].
This diagram sets the grounds for a unifying approach to the study of equilibrium states
on C ∗-algebras in [ABLS], where remarkable results on the structure of KMS-states on
C ∗(S) were obtained for right LCM semigroups satisfying an admissibility condition
which implies property (AR), see Subsection 2.1. Working with abstract right LCM
semigroups as opposed to explicit classes of examples allowed for a uniﬁcation of the in-
spiring case studies [LR10, BaHLR12, LRR11, LRRW14, CaHR16], and also for coverage
of a substantial amount of new examples, most notably, algebraic dynamical systems.
Moreover, the techniques in [BS16, Sta, ABLS] raise several questions on the structure
of right LCM semigroups, perhaps most notably:

(a) Are there right LCM semigroups without property (AR)?

(b) Which right LCM semigroups are admissible?
The aim of the present work is to investigate in how far graph products of right LCM
semigroups as considered in [VdC01, FK09] provide answers to these two questions. In
addition, we also address structural aspects related to the distinguished subsemigroups
S∗, Sc and Sci. We apply our results to the classical case of right-angled Artin monoids
A+
Γ given by an undirected graph Γ since many graph related phenomena can already
be witnessed here. Indeed, the explicit presentation of the boundary quotient in [CL07,
Corollary 8.5] involving only the vertex sets of the ﬁnite coconnected components of
the graph Γ may be regarded as an indication for a particularly accessible structure of
foundation sets. Another motivation comes from the elegant solution to the isomorphism
problem for C ∗(A+

Γ ), see [ELR16].

Since property (AR) is known for various kinds of right LCM semigroups, we were
struck by surprise to ﬁnd that a right-angled Artin monoid A+
Γ has property (AR) if and
only if all of its ﬁnitely generated direct summands are free, see Corollary 4.6. In terms
of the Γ, this means that all ﬁnite coconnected components Γi do not contain any edges.
The result follows from more general graph product considerations in Corollary 4.5 that
rely on Theorem 4.3, where we show that graph products over inﬁnite coconnected
graphs have no foundation set other than the obvious ones containing an invertible
element, while the analogous statement holds in the ﬁnite case for accurate foundation
sets.

The characterisation of property (AR) for right-angled Artin monoids A+

Γ in Corol-
lary 4.6 allows us to determine when A+
Γ is admissible in the sense of [ABLS]. It turns
out that admissibility and the existence of a generalised scale coincide for right-angled
Artin monoids, see Corollary 4.9 and Corollary 4.10. If existent, the generalised scale on
A+
Γ is unique and arises as the product of the unique generalised scales on its non-abelian
direct summands A+

Γi, see Proposition 4.8 and Corollary 4.9.

Thus we are lead to the conclusion that graph products of right LCM semigroups
mostly lack property (AR), and are therefore not admissible in the sense of [ABLS].
While this rules out the possibility of applying [ABLS] to graph products of right LCM
semigroups in great generality, we obtain a fairly detailed description of the behaviour
of graph products with respect to the subsemigroups Sc and Sci, see Theorem 3.4.
These result show that the graph product represents a useful tool to construct new, and
potentially very interesting examples of right LCM semigroups that are well-behaved
to some degree, but demand more sophisticated techniques then those applicable to
right LCM semigroups that have property (AR) or even a generalised scale. That is
why we feel that this work might stimulate further research in the direction of inverse
semigroups and groupoids related to (right LCM) semigroups and their C ∗-algebras.

2. Preliminaries

Here we provide the prerequisites we shall need concerning right LCM semigroups

and graph products.

2.1. Right LCM semigroups. A left cancellative semigroup S is called right LCM if
the intersection of two principal right ideals in S is either empty or a principal right

GRAPH PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE OF PROPERTY (AR)

ideal. For s, t ∈ S, we say that s and t are orthogonal and write s ⊥ t if sS ∩ tS = ∅.
Unless speciﬁed otherwise, we will always assume that a right LCM semigroup S has an
identity, i.e. S is a monoid.

Let us ﬁrst discuss property (AR). A ﬁnite subset F ⊂ S is called a foundation set for
S if for every s ∈ S there is f ∈ F such that f 6⊥ s, see [BRRW14, Section 5]. A subset
F ⊂ S is accurate if f ⊥ f ′ for all f, f ′ ∈ F, f 6= f ′, see [BS16, Deﬁnition 2.1]. If F, F ′
are foundation sets such that F ′ ⊂ F S, then F ′ is called a reﬁnement of F . We then
say that S has the accurate reﬁnement property, or property (AR), if every foundation
set for S has an accurate reﬁnement, see [BS16, Deﬁnition 2.3].

For a right LCM semigroup S, its subgroup of invertible elements shall be denoted
by S∗. This subgroup lies inside the core subsemigroup Sc := {a ∈ S | a 6⊥ s for all s ∈
S}, which was ﬁrst considered for right LCM semigroups in [Star15], but stems from
[CL07, Deﬁnition 5.4]. We remark that Sc is again a right LCM semigroup. Furthermore,
it induces an equivalence relation s ∼ t :⇔ sa = tb for some a, b ∈ Sc called the core
relation. In contrast to Sc, we also consider the subsemigroup Sci of core irreducible
elements, that is, the collection of all elements s ∈ S \ Sc for which every factorization
s = ta with t ∈ S, a ∈ Sc satisﬁes a ∈ S∗. While Sci does not have an identity by
construction, its unitisation S1

ci := Sci ∪ {1} and S′

ci := Sci ∪ S∗ do.

A right LCM semigroup S is called core factorable if S = S1

ciSc. We say that Sci ⊂ S is
∩-closed if sS ∩ tS = rS implies r ∈ Sci whenever s, t ∈ Sci. To provide some indication
why this property is of interest, let us mention that Sci ⊂ S is ∩-closed if and only if S′
ci
is right LCM and its inclusion into S is a homomorphism of right LCM semigroups, i.e. it
preserves intersections of principal right ideals, see [ABLS, Proposition 3.3]. Finally, a
nontrivial homomorphism N : S → N× is called a generalised scale if |N −1(n)/∼| = n
and every minimal complete set of representatives for N −1(n)/∼ forms an accurate
foundation set for S for all n ∈ N(S). Every generalised scale N satisﬁes ker N = Sc
by [ABLS, Proposition 3.6(i)], and the existence of a generalised scale entails vital
information on the structure of S. For instance, it implies that the right LCM semigroup
has property (AR), see [ABLS, Proposition 3.6(v)].

Finally, we recall from [ABLS, Deﬁnition 3.1] that a right LCM semigroup S is called
admissible, if it is core factorable, Sci ⊂ S is ∩-closed, and S admits a generalised scale
N such that N(S) ⊂ N× is freely generated by its irreducible elements.

2.2. Graph products. Within this work, a graph will mean a countable, undirected
graph Γ = (V, E) without loops or multiple edges. The concept of a graph product of
groups emerged in [Gre90] as a generalization of graph groups, and has been transferred
to the setting of monoids in [VdC01]: For a graph Γ = (V, E) and a family of monoids
(Sv)v∈V , the graph product is the monoid SΓ obtained as the quotient of the direct sum
Lv∈V Sv by the congruence generated by the relation (st, ts) if s ∈ Sv, t ∈ Sw with
(v, w) ∈ E, see [VdC01, Section 2] and [FK09, Section 1]. Given a graph Γ, its right-
Γ is the graph product with Sv = N for all v ∈ V . These monoids
angled Artin monoid A+
have also been studied under the names of graph monoids, free partially commutative
monoids, and trace monoids, see for instance [Die90]. If one switches the vertex monoids
from the natural numbers to the integers, the resulting graph product is the right-angled
Artin group AΓ associated to Γ, see [Cha07] for more.

4

NICOLAI STAMMEIER

It was shown in [CL02] that the graph product is well-behaved with respect to quasi-
lattice orders. Invoking a characterization of the right LCM property via the inverse hull
semigroup, Fountain and Kambites showed that this can be generalised to right LCM
semigroups, see [FK09, Theorem 2.6], where we note that we can move back and forth
between right cancellative, left LCM semigroups (used in [FK09]) and left cancellative,
right LCM semigroups by passing to the opposite semigroup.

According to [FK09, Theorem 1.1], which is an adaptation of the corresponding result
in [Gre90], every element s in a graph product SΓ is represented by an essentially unique
reduced expression sv(1)sv(2) · · · sv(n), that is, sv(k) ∈ Sv(k), v(k) 6= v(k + 1), and whenever
there are 1 ≤ k < m ≤ n such that v(k) = v(m), then there exists k < ℓ < m such
that (v(k), v(ℓ)) /∈ E. The analogous result had been proven in the quasi-lattice ordered
case before, see [CL02, Theorem 2]. The reduced expression is unique in the sense that
any two reduced expressions for the same element are shuﬄe equivalent, i.e. we can
move from one to the other by a ﬁnte number of switches of neighbouring factors whose
vertices are adjacent in Γ. Thus there exists a subadditive function ℓ : SΓ → N that
assigns the length of any reduced expression to the element in question.

A graph Γ is said to be coconnected if there exists no partition V = V1 ⊔ V2 with
Vi 6= ∅ and V1 × V2 ⊂ E. Equivalently, Γ is coconnected if the opposite graph Γopp :=
(V, V × V \ (E ∪ {(v, v) | v ∈ V })) is connected. The decomposition of Γ into its
coconnected components is the initial step in the analysis of SΓ, see for instance [ELR16],
where the synonym co-irreducible is used. Every graph Γ has a unique decomposition
into coconnected components, which we denote by (Γi)i∈I with Γi = (Vi, Ei). The
original graph can be recovered from (Γi)i∈I as V = Fi∈I Vi and E = {(v, w) ∈ V × V |
(v, w) ∈ Ei or w /∈ Vi ∋ v for some i ∈ I}.
It follows from this observation that
SΓ coincides with the direct sum Li∈I SΓi over the graph products obtained from its
coconnected components.

A vertex v ∈ V is called isolated if v does not emit any edge, and universal if v is
connected to every other vertex in Γ. We note that the only coconnected graph with
a universal vertex v is V = {v}, and that any graph containing an isolated edge is
necessarily coconnected. For convenience, we let Vu denote the set of universal vertices,
and I2 := {i ∈ I | |Vi| ≥ 2}.

We will make use of the following notion of a blocking path, that is actually a path

in the opposite graph.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Γ = (V, E) be a graph and C ⊂ V . A blocking path for C is a ﬁnite
sequence of vertices w(1), . . . , w(n) ∈ V such that

(a) w(1) /∈ C, (w(k), w(k + 1)) /∈ E for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, and
(b) for every u ∈ C there exists 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that (w(k), u) /∈ E.

It turns out that blocking paths are almost always available whenever the graph is
coconnected, and we will frequently make use of this elementary observation in the
course of this work.

Lemma 2.2. If Γ is a coconnected graph with at least two vertices, then every ﬁnite
proper subset C of V admits a blocking path ending in any prescribed vertex.

Proof. Let C = {v(1), . . . , v(m)} ⊂ V be ﬁnite and proper, that is, V \C 6= ∅. If (v, u) ∈
E for all v ∈ C, u ∈ V \ C, then we would get a contradiction to Γ being coconnected.

Thus there exists w(1) ∈ V \ C such that (v(k), w(1)) /∈ E for some 1 ≤ k ≤ m.
Without loss of generality, we can assume k = 1. Since Γ is coconnected, we can choose
w′(k) ∈ V for 2 ≤ k ≤ m such that (v(k), w′(k)) /∈ E. Again by coconnectedness, there
exists a ﬁnite path w(1), . . . , w(n) in Γopp that visits every w′(k), 2 ≤ k ≤ n. This is a
blocking path for C, and since Γopp is connected, we can attach to this blocking path a
path leading to any prescribed vertex without loosing the blocking property for C. (cid:3)

Remark 2.3. Let Γ = (V, E) be a graph and (Sv)v∈V a family of right LCM semi-
groups. Suppose w(1), . . . , w(n) is a blocking path for some nonempty C, and we can
choose sn, tn ∈ Sw(n) \ S∗
w(n). Then for all s0, t0 whose reduced expressions only contain
parts from vertex semigroups of vertices in C, and all sk, tk ∈ Sw(k), 1 ≤ k < n, we
have ℓ(s0s1 · · · sn) = ℓ(s0) + n and s0s1 · · · sn ⊥ t0t1 · · · tn, unless sk = tk for 0 ≤ k <
n and sn 6⊥ tn. Thus blocking paths allow for the construction of shuﬄe inert elements
in graph products, which turns out to be quite useful.

3. The internal structure of graph products

In this section we show that many of the properties of SΓ that are of interest to
us, e.g. in connection with [ABLS], can be understood from a study of the corre-
sponding graph products for the coconnected components (Γi)i∈I of Γ. The reason
is SΓ = Li∈I SΓi and the following list of straightforward observations, where we write
s = ⊕i∈I si for s ∈ Li∈I Si:
Proposition 3.1. Let (Si)i∈I be a family of right LCM semigroups. Then S := Li∈I Si
has the following features:
(i) S∗ = Li∈I S∗
(ii) s, t ∈ S are core related if and only if si and ti are core related in Si for all i ∈ I.
(iii) The following statements hold for S if and only if their analogues hold for all Si:
S is core factorable, Sci ⊂ S is ∩-closed, α : Sc y S/∼, a.[s] := [as] is faithful,
and S has ﬁnite propagation.

i , Sc = Li∈I(Si)c, and S′

ci = Li∈I(Si)′

ci.

(iv) The action α : Sc y S/∼, a.[s] := [as] is almost free if and only if one of the

following conditions holds:
(a) Si is left reversible for all i ∈ I, that is, S = Sc so that S/ ∼ is a singleton.
(b) There exists a unique i ∈ I such that Si is not left reversible, αi : (Si)c y

Si/∼ is almost free, and Sj is left reversible for all j ∈ I \ {i}.

In view of the direct sum decomposition for graph products over the coconnected
components, we need to understand the behaviour of the graph product in the case of
a coconnected graph with at least two vertices. To do this, we will need to consider a
variant of the action α for S∗, i.e. α∗ : S∗ y S/S∗, x.[s] := [xs]. Also, we will assume
that all vertex semigroups Sv, v ∈ V are nontrivial in order to avoid pathological cases.
For instance, if Γ is the union of a complete graph and an isolated vertex v, and Sv
is trivial, then the graph product will be the direct sum of the right LCM semigroups
attached to the vertices of the complete graph, even though the original graph was larger
and coconnected.

Theorem 3.2. If Γ = (V, E) is coconnected, |V | ≥ 2, and (Sv)v∈V is a family of
nontrivial right LCM semigroups, then the following assertions hold:

v )v∈V to SΓ (resulting from the universal property) is bijective, so that S∗

u is trivial for all u ∈ U.
Proof. For (i), let sv(1)sv(2) · · · sv(n) be a reduced expression for s ∈ SΓ. Clearly, s is
invertible in SΓ if and only if sv(k) ∈ S∗
v(k) for all k. The homomorphism from the graph
product of (S∗
Γ is
the graph product with respect to Γ and (S∗
v )v∈V . Now assume that there is 1 ≤ m ≤ n
such that sv(k) ∈ S∗
v(m). Since Γ is coconnected,
there is w ∈ V with w 6= v(m) and (v(m), w) /∈ E. For every t ∈ Sw \ {1}, we
thus have sv(m)sv(m+1) · · · sv(n) ⊥ tsv(m)sv(m+1) · · · sv(n). By left cancellation, this yields
s ⊥ sv(1)sv(2) · · · sv(m−1)tsv(m)sv(m+1) · · · sv(n), so that s /∈ (SΓ)c. This proves (SΓ)c = S∗
Γ,
and the claims (SΓ)ci = SΓ \ S∗

Γ, (ii), and (iii) are immediate consequences of this.

v(k) for 1 ≤ k < m but sv(m) /∈ S∗

v . Every x ∈ S∗

For (iv), we note that α is not faithful if Sv is a group for all v ∈ V because then
SΓ/∼ is a singleton while S∗
Γ = SΓ is nontrivial. So let us assume that there exists v ∈ V
with Sv 6= S∗
Γ \ {1} has a reduced expression xu(1)xu(2) · · · xu(m) with
xu(k) ∈ S∗
u(k) \ {1}. Since Γ is coconnected and |V | ≥ 2, there exists a blocking path
w(1), . . . , w(n) for {u(m)} with w(n) = v, see Lemma 2.2. Choose sw(k) ∈ Sw(k) \ {1} for
1 ≤ k < n and sw(n) ∈ Sw(n) \ S∗
w(n). Then s := sw(1)sw(2) · · · sw(n) ∈ SΓ satisﬁes xu(m)s ⊥
s. If 1 ≤ k ≤ m − 1 satisﬁes (u(k), u(ℓ)) ∈ E for all k < ℓ ≤ m, then (u(k), u(m)) ∈ E
in particular implies u(k) 6= v(1). For the same reason, (u(k), v(1)) ∈ E implies u(k) 6=
v(2), and so on. Thus xu(1)xu(2) · · · xu(m)sw(1)sw(2) · · · sw(n) is a reduced expression for xs
and we conclude that orthogonality is not destroyed by xu(1)xu(2) · · · xu(m−1), i.e. xs ⊥ s.
In particular, [xs] 6= [s] and therefore α is faithful.

To prove (v), we ﬁrst observe that (a) is necessary for α to be almost free: If v ∈ V is
isolated, then [xs] = [s] for x ∈ S∗
v \ {1} and [s] ∈ SΓ implies s ∈ Sv. Suppose next that
(b) does not hold, i.e. there exists a connected component U ⊂ V of Γ with |U| ≥ 2
such that there are u, v ∈ U with Sv 6= S∗
u 6= {1}. If u = v, then we can pick
w ∈ U \ {v} with (v, w) ∈ E. If there is x ∈ S∗
w 6= {1}, then [xs] = [sx] = [s] for all
s ∈ Sv, and since Sv /S∗
v is inﬁnite, α fails to be almost free for x. On the other hand,
Sw is nontrivial, so S∗
w is inﬁnite, and then almost freeness
fails for every x ∈ S∗

w = {1} implies that Sw/S∗

v and S∗

v 6= {1}.

Now suppose u 6= v. As U is connected, we can ﬁnd a path v(0) := u, v(1), . . . , v(n) :=
v from u to v inside U, i.e. (v(k), v(k + 1)) ∈ E for all 0 ≤ k < n. Then there exists
0 ≤ k < n such that S∗
v(k+1), and we can apply the above
argument to deduce that α is not almost free. We have thus proven that almost freeness
of α implies (a) and (b).

v(k) 6= {1} and Sv(k+1) 6= S∗

Conversely, assume that (a) and (b) hold. If SΓ is a group, then there is nothing to
show, so we may suppose that SΓ 6= S∗
Γ \ {1} be presented by a reduced
expression xu(1)xu(2) · · · xu(m) with xu(k) ∈ S∗
Γ with reduced
expression sv(1) · · · sv(n), sv(k) ∈ Sv(k). Let 1 ≤ j ≤ n be the smallest number such that

u(k) \ {1}. Fix s ∈ SΓ \ S∗

Γ. Let x ∈ S∗

GRAPH PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE OF PROPERTY (AR)

7

sv(j) /∈ S∗
v(j). By (b), j is invariant under shuﬄing and we know that v(j) does not
belong to the connected component of any u(k) that emits an edge. Therefore, xs ⊥ s
and then [xs] 6= [s], unless j = m = 1 and u(1) = v(1) = v for some isolated vertex
In this case, (a) says that there are only ﬁnitely many ﬁxed points for x in
v ∈ V .
(cid:3)
Sv /S∗
Remark 3.3. The graph product SΓ for a coconnected graph Γ with |V | ≥ 2 has ﬁnite
propagation if S∗

v . Thus α is almost free if (and only if) (a) and (b) hold.

v is a ﬁnite group for all v ∈ V .

Let us now summarise what Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 imply for graph products

of right LCM semigroups.

Theorem 3.4. Let Γ = (V, E) be a graph and (Sv)v∈V a family of nontrivial right LCM
semigroups. Then:

Γ = Lv∈Vu S∗

v ⊕ Li∈I2 S∗
Γi.

(i) S∗
(ii) (SΓ)c = Lv∈Vu(Sv)c ⊕ Li∈I2 S∗
Γi.
(iii) (SΓ)′
ci = Lv∈Vu(Sv)′
ci ⊕ Li∈I2 SΓi.
(iv) Two elements s, t ∈ SΓ are core related if and only if sv ∼v tv for all v ∈ Vu and

si ∈ tiS∗

Γi for all i ∈ I2.

(v) SΓ is core factorable if and only if Sv is core factorable for every v ∈ Vu.
(vi) (SΓ)ci ⊂ SΓ is ∩-closed if and only if (Sv)ci ⊂ Sv is ∩-closed for every v ∈ Vu.
(vii) The action α : (SΓ)c y SΓ/∼ is faithful if and only if αv : (Sv)c y Sv/∼ is faithful
for every v ∈ Vu, and for every i ∈ I2 there exists w ∈ Vi such that Sw is not a
group.

(viii) The action α : (SΓ)c y SΓ/∼ is almost free if and only if one of the following

conditions holds:
(a) (Sv)c = {1} for all v ∈ Vu and S∗
(b) (Sv)c 6= {1} for a unique v ∈ Vu with αv : (Sv)c → Sv/∼ almost free, while

w = {1} for all w ∈ V \ Vu.

Sw = (Sw)c for all w ∈ Vu \ {v} and Sw′ = S∗
6= {1} for a unique i ∈ I2 with αi : S∗
(c) S∗
Γi
Sw = (Sw)c for all w ∈ Vu and SΓj = S∗

Γj for all j ∈ I2 \ {i}.

w′ for all w′ ∈ V \ Vu.
Γi → SΓi/∼ almost free, while

(ix) SΓ has ﬁnite propagation if Sv has ﬁnite propagation for every v ∈ Vu and S∗

w is

a ﬁnite group for all w ∈ V \ Vu.

The conditions for almost freeness in Theorem 3.4 correspond to (SΓ)c = {1}, (SΓ)c =
∼== SΓi/∼, respectively. Hence they are quite restrictive, and we
(Sv)c, and SΓ/∼
view this as an indication that ﬁnite propagation might be much more useful for graph
products than almost freeness of α, see [ABLS, Theorem 4.2(2)] for details.

When applied to right-angled Artin monoids, Theorem 3.4 takes a simpler form:

Corollary 3.5. For a graph Γ = (V, E), the right-angled Artin monid A+

Γ satisﬁes:

4. The absence of property (AR)

In this section, we will prove that for many graph products of right LCM semigroups
SΓ, the only accurate foundation sets are given by elements of S∗
Γ. In particular, we
obtain the an abundance of right LCM semigroups that lack property (AR). Again, the
starting point is a basic observation for direct sums of right LCM semigroups, which
allows us to boil the analysis down to the coconnected case:

Proposition 4.1. Let (Si)i∈I be a family of right LCM semigroups.
property (AR), then Si has property (AR) for all i ∈ I.
Proof. Fix i ∈ I and let S := Li∈I Si. Every foundation set F for Si is a foundation set
for S. Suppose that F has an accurate reﬁnement Fa in S. For s ∈ SΓ, we let s = si + ˆsi
with si ∈ Si and ˆsi ∈ Lj∈I\{i} Sj. If s ∈ Fa, then {fi ∈ Si | f ∈ Fa : ˆfi 6⊥ ˆsi} is an
(cid:3)
accurate reﬁnement for F inside Si.
Corollary 4.2. If a graph product SΓ has property (AR), then SΓi has property (AR)
for each coconnected component Γi of Γ.

If Li∈I Si has

Theorem 4.3. Let Γ = (V, E) be a coconnected graph with at least two vertices and
suppose (Sv)v∈V is a family of nontrivial right LCM semigroups.

(i) If Γ is inﬁnite, then every foundation set for SΓ contains an invertible element.

In particular, SΓ has property (AR) and C ∗(SΓ) = Q(SΓ).

(ii) If Γ is ﬁnite and E 6= ∅, then the accurate foundation sets for SΓ correspond
Γ. In particular, SΓ has property (AR) if and only if SΓ does not admit a

to S∗
foundation set without invertible elements.

Proof. Both (i) and (ii) hold for trivial reasons if SΓ is a group, so we can assume that
there exists w ∈ V with Sw 6= S∗
w. Let F ⊂ SΓ be a ﬁnite subset without invertible
elements. For every f ∈ F , we choose a reduced expression f = fv(1) · · · fv(mf ) with
mf ∈ N× and fv(k) ∈ Sv(k).

Suppose ﬁrst that Γ is inﬁnite. As f ∈ SΓ \ S∗

Γ, there is a least 1 ≤ kf ≤ mf such that
fv(kf ) /∈ S∗
v(kf ). Then C := {v ∈ V | fv(k) ∈ Sv for some f ∈ F, 1 ≤ k ≤ kf }. Then C is
a ﬁnite set of vertices so that Lemma 2.2 grants us a blocking path w(1), . . . , w(n) for
C ending in w. If we choose any sk ∈ Sw(k) \ {1} for 1 ≤ k < n and sn ∈ Sw \ S∗
w, then
s1 · · · sn ⊥ f for all f ∈ F as s1 · · · sn ⊥ fv(1) · · · fv(kf ) by construction, see Remark 2.3.
Therefore F is not a foundation set. We conclude that every foundation set for SΓ
contains an invertible element x, which clearly gives an accurate reﬁnement {x}. So
SΓ has property (AR), but if the only accurate foundation sets come from invertible
elements, then the boundary relation Pf ∈F ef SΓ = 1 becomes trivial so that C ∗(S) =
Q(S).

Now let Γ be ﬁnite, E 6= ∅, and assume F to be accurate as well. We need to show
that F is not a foundation set. Without loss of generality, we can require that fv(mf ) is
not invertible for all f ∈ F because invertible ends do not play a role when it comes to
intersections of right ideals. Since F does not contain any invertibles, we have ℓ(f ) ≥ 1
for all f ∈ F . Let L := maxf ∈F ℓ(F ), and choose f ∈ F with ℓ(f ) = L. Then we have
f = stv for some v ∈ V, tv ∈ Sv \ {1}, and s ∈ SΓ with ℓ(s) = L − 1. We will ﬁrst show
that v is isolated, and then use this together with E 6= ∅ to conclude that F cannot be
a foundation set.

GRAPH PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE OF PROPERTY (AR)

If (v, u) ∈ E for some u ∈ V , we employ Lemma 2.2 to obtain a blocking path

w(1), . . . , w(n) for C := {u} ∪ Nu, and set w(0) := u. Next, choose bk ∈ Sw(k) \ S∗
w(k)
for each 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and let r ∈ Su \ {1}. It then follows that srb ⊥ f for b := b1 · · · bn.
Moreover, we have ℓ(srb) ≥ m + 1. This could be assumed by extending the path
w(0), . . . , w(n) in Γopp, but actually holds true in any case. It then follows that whenever
f ′ ∈ F satisﬁes f ′
6⊥ f 6= f ′ so that
6⊥ srb, we have srb ∈ f ′SΓ. If sr ∈ f ′Γ, then f ′
F would not be accurate. The blocking path then forces f ′ = srb1 · · · bk for some
1 ≤ k ≤ n. However, we then get f ′ ⊥ sr′b for every r′ ∈ Su \ {r}. Since Su is a left
cancellative semigroup that is not a group, it is inﬁnite. Thus there is r ∈ Su \ {1} such
that srb ⊥ f ′ for all f ′ ∈ F .

We deduce from this that F cannot be a foundation set if there exists f ∈ F with
ℓ(f ) = L that does not end in a part from an isolated vertex. In particular, if Γ does
not have any isolated vertices, no accurate ﬁnite subset F without invertible elements
is a foundation set. Now suppose Γ has an isolated vertex ˜v, and let

F ′ := {f ∈ F | fv(k) ∈ Sv for some k ⇒ v is not isolated.},

that is, the subset of F consisting of those elements whose reduced expressions do not
contain any part coming from an isolated vertex. As E 6= ∅ and the vertex semigroups
are all nontrivial, the ﬁnite accurate set F ′ is also non-empty.
Suppose ﬁrst that there is ˜f ∈ F ′ with ˜f ∈ Sv \ S∗

v for some v ∈ V . Since F ′ is
accurate and (v, u) ∈ E for some u ∈ V , we have s /∈ f ′SΓ for all s ∈ Su and f ′ ∈ F ′.
Thus we get str ⊥ f ′ for all f ′ ∈ F ′ whenever s ∈ Su, t ∈ S˜v, and r ∈ Sw \ S∗
w, compare
Remark 2.3. For f ∈ F \ F ′, we have strtr ⊥ f unless f ∈ strtSΓ because ˜v is isolated
and r is not invertible. Since F is ﬁnite while Sw \ S∗
w is inﬁnite, we conclude that there
are s ∈ Su, t ∈ S˜v, and r ∈ Sw \ S∗
w such that strtr ⊥ f for all f ∈ F . So F is not a
foundation set.

On the other hand, if we have ℓ(f ) ≥ 2 for every f ∈ F ′, we pick a vertex v that
emits an edge. Then s /∈ f SΓ for all s ∈ Sv, f ∈ F ′, and thus str ⊥ f for all f ∈ F ′
whenever s ∈ Sv, t ∈ S˜v, and r ∈ Sw \ S∗
w. As in the previous case, there are s, t, r such
that strtr ⊥ f for all f ∈ F , and thus F is not a foundation set.

Finally, if F is a foundation set for SΓ with F ∩ S∗

F satisﬁes F ′ ∩ S∗
every foundation set F with x ∈ F ∩ S∗

Γ = ∅, then every reﬁnement F ′ of
Γ = ∅ as well, and thus can never be accurate. On the other hand,
(cid:3)

Γ has an accurate reﬁnement {x}.

We point out that the assumptions in Theorem 4.3 are modest means to avoid the
somewhat pathological cases: SΓ = Sv, the free product SΓ = ∗v∈V Sv, and the graph
product of groups.

Remark 4.4. By Theorem 4.3 (i), foundation sets of SΓ are governed by parts from
the ﬁnite coconnected components in the following sense: Let F be a foundation set
for SΓ such that no propert subset of F is a foundation set. If s = sv(1) · · · sv(n) ∈ F
with sv(k) ∈ Sv(k), then sv(k) /∈ S∗
v(k) implies that v(k) ∈ Vi for some ﬁnite coconnected
component Γi = (Vi, Ei) of Γ.

Corollary 4.5. Let Γ be a graph and (Sv)v∈V a family of nontrivial right LCM semi-
groups. If there is i ∈ I2 for which Γi = (Vi, Ei) is ﬁnite with Ei 6= ∅, Sv is not a group

for some v ∈ Vi, and there exists a foundation set F for SΓi without invertible elements,
then SΓ does not have property (AR).

Proof. The claim follows from combining Theorem 4.3 with Corollary 4.2.

(cid:3)

The previous results apply nicely to right-angled Artin monoids.

Corollary 4.6. For graph Γ, the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) Every ﬁnite coconnected component Γi of Γ is edge-free.
(2) Every ﬁnitely generated direct summand of A+
(3) The right-angled Artin monoid A+

Γ is free.
Γ has property (AR).

Γ with F ⊂ Lv∈Vu Sv ⊕ Li∈I2:|Vi|<∞ A+

Proof. The equivalence of (1) and (2) is clear from the direct sum description of A+
Γ in
Subsection 2.2. From Remark 4.4 we infer that it suﬃces to obtain accurate reﬁnements
of foundation sets F for A+
Γi. But if (2) holds,
then the latter is just a direct sum of ﬁnitely generated free monoids, and clearly admits
accurate reﬁnements. So (2) implies (3). Finally, if (3) is valid and Γi = (Vi, Ei) is a
coconnected component of Γ with 2 ≤ |Vi| < ∞, then {av | v ∈ Vi} is a foundation set
Γi without invertible elements, so Corollary 4.5 forces Ei = ∅, that is, (1) holds. (cid:3)
for A+
By Corollary 4.6, there exist countably many mutually non-isomorphic, ﬁnitely gen-
erated right LCM semigroups without property (AR). As a ﬁnal part of this section, we
address the existence of a generalised scale for right-angled Artin monoids associated
to ﬁnite graphs. The existence of a generalised scale turned out to be relevant for a
standardised approach to study KMS-states on the semigroup C ∗-algebra C ∗(A+
Γ ), see
[ABLS]. We ﬁrst note that free monoids have a generalised scale only if they are ﬁnitely
generated and nonabelian, in which case it is unique:
Proposition 4.7. The free monoid F+
generalised scale N : F+
of w ∈ F+
m.

m in 2 ≤ m < ∞ generators admits a unique
m → N× given by N(w) = mℓ(w), where ℓ denotes the word length

Proof. The map N is a generalised scale. On the other hand, let ˜N be a generalised
m = ha1, . . . , ami, and ﬁx 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Then ˜N (ai) > 1 as ai is not part of
scale on F+
m)c = {1}. By deﬁnition of ˜N and since ∼ is trivial, the set ˜N −1( ˜N (ai)) is an accurate
(F+
m of cardinality ˜N(ai) that contains ai. If there was 1 ≤ j ≤ m, j 6= i
foundation set for F+
such that ˜N (aj) 6= ˜N(ai), then the foundation set property would give a w ∈ ˜N −1( ˜N (ai))
m. As this forces ˜N (w) ≥ ˜N (ai) ˜N (aj) > ˜N (ai) = ˜N(w), we arrive
such that w ∈ ajaiF+
at a contradiction. Thus ˜N (aj) = ˜N(ai) for all j 6= i. But as {a1, . . . , am} is an accurate
(cid:3)
m, we conclude that ˜N (ai) = m for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m.

Proof. As M = Sc = ker N for any generalised scale N on S, see [ABLS, Proposi-
tion 3.6(i)], we can focus on (F+
mi is the free monoid in mi generators,
which we denote by ai,1, . . . , ai,mi. The strategy is to prove that
(a) any generalised scale N on S restricts to Ni on F+
mi, and
(b) the homomorphism N : S → N× arising from (Ni)i∈I is a generalised scale if and

mi)i∈I. Recall that F+

only if m is rationally independent.

For (a), suppose S admits a generalised scale N and ﬁx i ∈ I, 1 ≤ k ≤ mi. Then
N(ai,k) > 1 and there are w1, . . . , wN (ai,k)−1 ∈ S such that {ai,k, w1, . . . , wN (ai,k)−1}
is an accurate foundation set for S contained in N −1(N(ai,k)). Let us decompose wℓ
as wℓ = ˆwℓ ⊕ ˇwℓ ∈ F+
mj (cid:1). Then {ai,k, ˆw1, . . . , ˆwN (ai,k)−1} is a
foundation set for F+
mi with ai,k ⊥ ˆwℓ and N( ˆwℓ) ≤ N(ai,k) for all ℓ. This forces
{ai,k, ˆw1, . . . , ˆwN (ai,k)−1} ⊃ {ai,1, . . . , ai,mi}, and thus N(ai,ℓ) ≤ N(ai,k) for all 1 ≤ ℓ ≤
mi, just like in the proof of Proposition 4.7. As k was arbitrary, we deduce N(ai,k) =
mi = Ni(ai,k) for all i, k.

mi ⊕ (cid:0)Mn ⊕ Lj∈I\{i}

F+

In view of (a), the question behing the main claim becomes: Under which condition
is the homomorphism N : S → N× arising from the family of generalised scales (Ni)i∈I
itself a generalised scale? If m is rationally independent, then every k ∈ N(S) has a
factorization k = Qi∈I mki

i with uniquely determined ki ∈ N. This implies that

N −1(k) = {t ⊕ L

mi with ℓi(wi) = ki}.

N, k 6= k′ such that K := Qi∈I mki

Therefore, |N −1(k)/∼| = k, and any transversal of N −1(k)/∼ is an accurate foundation
set for S, that is, N is a generalised scale. On the other hand, if there are k, k′ ∈
k′
i , then both k and k′ yield a set of
i = Qi∈I m
i
Li∈I
K mutually orthogonal elements s1, . . . , sK ∈ S and t1, . . . , tK ∈ S, respectively, with
N(sj) = K = N(tj) for all j. Since there is i ∈ I with ki 6= k′
i, the i-th components
of sj and tj′ have diﬀerent length for all j, j′. Thus sj 6∼ tj′ for all j, j′, and we get
(cid:3)
|N −1(K)/∼| ≥ 2K. Therefore N is not a generalised scale in this case.

We can now state our conclusions for right-angled Artin monoids.

Corollary 4.9. For every graph Γ, the right-angled Artin monoid A+
Γ admits a gener-
alised scale N if and only if Vu 6= V , all coconnected components Γi = (Vi, Ei) are ﬁnite
and edge-free, and Li∈I2|Vi| is rationally independent. In this case, N is unique.

Proof. The condition Vu 6= V is equivalent to saying that A+
So if all coconnected components Γi = (Vi, Ei) are ﬁnite and edge-free, then A+

Γ is non-abelian, i.e.I2 6= ∅.

Conversely, suppose A+

Γ admits a generalised scale N. Since N is a nontrivial ho-
N, we need to have Vu 6= V so that the set I2 is
momorphism with ker N = Lv∈Vu
non-empty. Moreover, A+
Γ has property (AR) by [ABLS, Proposition 3.6], so Corol-
lary 4.6 implies that all ﬁnite coconnected components Γi of Γ are edge-free. If there
was an inﬁnite coconnected component Γi = (Vi, Ei), then 1 < N(av) < ∞ for all v ∈ Vi,
and the deﬁning property of a generalised scale would yield an accurate foundation set
