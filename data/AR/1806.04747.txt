Abstract

A ring R is said to be of stable range 1.5 if for each a, b ∈ R and 0 6= c ∈ R
satisfying aR+ bR+ cR = R there exists r ∈ R such that (a+ br)R+ cR = R.
Let R be a commutative domain in which all ﬁnitely generated ideals are
principal, and let R be of stable range 1.5. Then each matrix A over R is
reduced to Smith’s canonical form by transformations P AQ in which P and
Q are invertible and at least one of them can be chosen to be a product
of elementary matrices. We generalize Helmer’s theorem about the greatest
common divisor of entries of A over R.

1. Introduction and main results

The problem of ﬁnding canonical forms of a matrix up to equivalency is
classical. The rings over which matrices are equivalent to certain diagonal
matrices have been studied extensively. In the present paper we investigate
such question for some classes of commutative Bezout domains.

The matrix diag(d1, d2, . . .) means a (possibly rectangular) matrix having
d1, d2, . . . on main diagonal and zeros elsewhere (by the main diagonal we
mean the one beginning at the upper left corner). We use the following

notations of commutative rings: (a1, . . . , an) denotes the greatest common
divisor of elements a1, . . . , an and a|b means that a is a divisor of b. The set
of all matrices of size n × m over a ring R is denoted by Rn×m.

An associative (not necessary commutative) ring R is called an elemen-
tary divisor ring (introduced by I. Kaplansky in [12]) if every (not necessary
square) matrix A over R admits a diagonal reduction, that is, there exist
invertible matrices P and Q over the ring R such that

P AQ = diag(ϕ1, . . . , ϕk, 0, . . . , 0) = Φ,

(1)

in which each element ϕi is a total divisor of ϕi+1 for i = 1, . . . , k − 1 (i.e.

Rϕi+1R ⊆ ϕiR ∩ Rϕi,

which is equivalent to ϕi|ϕi+1 when R is commutative). The matrix Φ is
called the Smith normal form and ϕ1, . . . , ϕk are the invariant factors of
the matrix A. Examples of such rings are the ring of integers Z (see [20]),
Euclidean rings and principal ideal rings (see [11, 22]).

A ring R is a Bezout ring if each of its ﬁnitely generated ideals is principal.
Each matrix from R1×n and Rn×1 over an elementary divisor ring R admits
a diagonal reduction. This is equivalent to the condition that each ﬁnitely
generated ideal in R is principal. Hence an elementary divisor ring is a Be-
zout ring. Gilman and Henriksen constructed an example of a commutative
Bezout ring which is not an elementary divisor ring (see [6, Example 4.11,
p. 382]). This raises the problem whether an arbitrary commutative Bezout
domain is an elementary divisor ring. Euclidean rings and principal ideal
rings satisfy the ascending chain condition on ideals. However Helmer [9]
showed that this condition can be replaced by the less restrictive hypothesis
that R is adequate.

A commutative Bezout domain R is adequate if for a, b ∈ R with a 6= 0,
there exist r, s ∈ R such that a = rs, in which (r, b) = 1 and if s′ is a non-
unit divisor of s, then (s′, b) 6= 1. Commutative principal ideal domains and
commutative regular rings with identity are adequate rings; see [7, Theorem
11, p. 365] (see also [5]).

The proof of the fact that an adequate ring is an elementary divisor ring
(see [9, Theorem 3, p. 234]) was based on [9, Theorem 1, p. 228] which says
that if A ∈ Rn×m has maximal rank over an adequate ring R, then there
is a row u = [1, u2, . . ., un] ∈ R1×n such that the g.c.d. of the entries of uA
and the g.c.d. of entries of the matrix A coincide. It means that there is an

invertible matrix U =

such that g.c.d. of entries of the matrix A

and g.c.d. of the elements of the ﬁrst row of matrix UA coincide. This result
was generalized for matrices with rank greater then one by Petrychkovych in
[15, Lemma 3.1,p. 71].

Deep studies of the theory of elementary divisor rings increasingly suggest
that methods of pure ring theory are insuﬃcient. Promising studies were
based on the concept of stable range of rings, introduced by Bass [2] as an
important K-theory invariant.

According to [3, Property (7.2)n, p. 106] (see also the deﬁnition after
Lemma 1 in [21]), the stable range of a ring R is the smallest positive integer
n such that the following condition holds:

(∗)n

for each a1, . . . , an+1 ∈ R satisfying a1R + · · · + an+1R = R

there exist b1, . . . , bn ∈ R for which

(a1 + an+1b1)R + · · · + (an + an+1bn)R = R.

If such n does not exist, then the stable range of R is inﬁnity.

The concept of the stable range of a ring turned out to be useful in the
study of elementary divisor rings. In particular, Zabavsky [23, Theorem 1,
p. 666] proves that each elementary divisor ring has stable range ≤ 2. His
survey [24] contains results on the problem when a commutative Bezout
domain is an elementary divisor ring.

We say that associative ring R has stable range 1.5 if for each a, b ∈ R

and 0 6= c ∈ R satisfying aR + bR + cR = R there exists r ∈ R with

(a + br)R + cR = R.

This notion was introduced by the second author [18] and studied in [16, 19].
Commutative principal ideal domains, adequate rings (see [14, Prorositions
3.15 and 3.14] and [1, Proposition 4]), rings of 2 × 2 matrices over rings listed
before (see [18, Theorem 5, p. 856]) has stable range 1.5.

Evidently each ring with stable range 1.5 has Bass stable range 2. The
converse is not always true. For instance, the subring Z + xQ[[x]] of the ring
of formal power series Q[[x]] over the ﬁeld of rational numbers Q (see [10,
Example 1, p. 160]) has stable range 2 but not 1.5 (see [17, Example 1.1,
p. 22]). This shows that the rings of stable range 1.5 are between the rings
of stable range 1 and 2, respectively.

3

Note that the notion of stable range 1.5 is closely related to the concept
of almost stable range 1, introduced by McGovern [14]. A ring R has almost
stable range 1 if each proper homomorphic image of R has stable range 1. In
such rings if aR + bR + cR = R, where c does not belong to the Jacobson
radical J(R) of R, then there exists r ∈ R (see [14, Theorem 3.6]) such that

(a + br)R + cR = R.

In commutative rings of almost stable range 1 the condition c /∈ J(R) can be
replaced to c 6= 0 (see [1, Proposition 4]). Using this result and [14, Theorem
3.7] we conclude that each commutative Bezout domain of stable range 1.5
is an elementary divisor ring.

Several authors deﬁne and study rings of idempotent stable range [4, 14],
rings of unit stable range [8], rings of neat stable range [25], and rings of
square stable range [13].

Our ﬁrst result is a generalization of Helmer’s result [9, Theorem 1].

Theorem 1. If R is a commutative Bezout domain, then the following con-
ditions are equivalent:

(i) R has stable range 1.5;

(ii) for each A ∈ Rn×m with rank(A) > 1, there exists u = [1, u2, . . ., un] ∈
R1×n such that uA = [b1, b2, . . ., bm], in which (b1, b2, . . . , bm) coincides
with the g.c.d. of entries of the matrix A.

The following example shows that the condition rank(A) > 1 in Theorem
7 0 ] ∈ Z2×2 and u = [1, u2] ∈ Z1×2. Then

1(ii) is essential. Indeed, let A := [ 5 0
uA = [5 + 7u2, 0]. The g.c.d. of entries of matrix A is equal to 1. But

(5 + 7u2, 0) = 5 + 7u2 6= ±1

for any u2 ∈ Z. However the ring Z has stable range 1.5.

Matrices P and Q satisfying equality (1) are called transforming matrices
of the matrix A. The set of all transforming matrices P and Q are denoted
by Tl(A) and Tr(A), respectively. An elementary matrix is a matrix which
is obtained from the identity matrix by elementary transformations.

Theorem 2. Let R be a commutative Bezout domain of stable range 1.5.
If A = [aij] ∈ Rn×m with rank(A) > 1, then both of the sets Tl(A), Tr(A)
contain an elementary matrices.

2. Proofs

If A, B are matrices such that A = UBV for some invertible matrices
U and V , then we say A ∼ B. We use the following result proved in [18,
Property 6, p. 50].

Lemma 1. Let R be a commutative Bezout domain of stable range 1.5. Let
a1, . . . , an be a collection of relatively prime elements in R and 0 6= ψ ∈ R.
Then there exist u1, . . . , un ∈ R such that

(i) u1a1 + · · · + unan = 1;

(ii) (u1, . . . , uk) = (ψ, uk) = 1 for each ﬁxed 2 ≤ k ≤ n.

Proof of Theorem 1. (i) =⇒ (ii). Let A ∈ Rn×m has rank greater than 1.
Without loss of generality, assume that m ≥ n. A ring R is an elementary
divisor ring. Therefore the equation (1) holds for some invertible P and Q.
Since rank(A) > 1, we have k ≥ 2 in (1). Consider

in which Is (s ≥ 1) is the identity s × s matrix and I0 is an empty matrix.
It is easy to check that

Φ′ := (UP )A(QV ) = diag(ϕk, ϕ2, ϕ3, . . . , ϕk−1, ϕ1, 0, . . . , 0).
If P1 := (UP ) det(UP )−1 and Q1 := (QV ) det(UP ), then P1AQ1 = Φ′ and

Moreover (see [18, Property 3, p. 48])

[s11, s12, . . . , s1n] = [1, t2, . . . , tn]P
for some t2, . . . , tn ∈ R. The equality P1AQ1 = Φ′ implies AQ1 = P −1
and so by (3) we have

= (s11ϕk, s12ϕ2, . . . , s1.k−1ϕk−1, s1kϕ1, 0, . . . , 0)
∼ (ϕ1, 0, . . ., 0),

so (1, t2, . . ., tn)A ∼ (ϕ1, 0, . . ., 0), in which ϕ1 is the g.c.d. of entries of A.

(i) ⇐= (ii). Let A := [ a c

b 0 ] ∈ R2×2, where a, b ∈ R, 0 6= c ∈ R, and

(a, b, c) = 1. There is [1, r] ∈ R1×2 such that [1, r]A = [b1, b2], where

(b1, b2) = (a, b, c) = 1.

Hence (a + br, c) = 1 and so R has stable range 1.5.
Proof of Theorem 2. By Theorem 1, there exists u = [1, u2, . . ., un] ∈ R1×n
such that uA = [b1, . . ., bn], in which ϕ1 := (b1, . . . , bm) is equal to the g.c.d.
of entries of A. Thus ϕ1 is the ﬁrst invariant factor of A (see (1)). Clearly

(F ∈ R(n−2)×(m−2)).

Continuing this process we obtain that there exist P ∈ GLn(R) and Q ∈
GLm(R) such that P AQ = diag(ϕ1, . . . , ϕk) in which P is a product of
elementary matrices.

Taking AT instead of A and applying the same reduction, we construct
”new” matrices P and Q such that Φ := P AT Q is the Smith canonical
matrix and P is a product of elementary matrices. Since Φ is symmetric,
Φ = ΦT = QT AP T , where P T is a product of elementary matrices.

Note that from Theorem 2 does not imply that in (1) both of P and Q

are elementary.
