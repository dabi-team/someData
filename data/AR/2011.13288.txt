(Dated: March 19, 2021)

Mass measurements of the nuclides 69As, 70,71Se and 71Br, produced via fragmentation of a 124Xe
primary beam at the FRS at GSI, have been performed with the multiple-reﬂection time-of-ﬂight
mass spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS) of the FRS Ion Catcher with an unprecedented mass resolving
power of almost 1,000,000. Such high resolving power is the only way to achieve accurate results and
resolve overlapping peaks of short-lived exotic nuclei, whose total number of accumulated events is
always limited. For the nuclide 69As, this is the ﬁrst direct mass measurement. A mass uncertainty
of 22 keV was achieved with only 10 events. For the nuclide 70Se, a mass uncertainty of 2.6 keV
was obtained, corresponding to a relative accuracy of δm/m = 4.0×10−8, with less than 500 events.
The masses of the nuclides 71Se and 71Br have been measured with an uncertainty of 23 and 16
keV, respectively. Our results for the nuclides 70,71Se and 71Br are in good agreement with the 2016
Atomic Mass Evaluation, and our result for the nuclide 69As resolves the discrepancy between the
previous indirect measurements. We measured also the mass of the molecule 14N15N40Ar (A=69)
with a relative accuracy of δm/m = 1.7×10−8, the highest yet achieved with an MR-TOF-MS.
Our results show that the measured restrengthening of the proton-neutron interaction (δVpn) for
odd-odd nuclei along the N=Z line above Z=29 (recently extended to Z=37) is hardly evident at
the N-Z=2 line, and not evident at the N-Z=4 line. Nevertheless, detailed structure of δVpn along
the N-Z=2 and N-Z=4 lines, conﬁrmed by our mass measurements, may provide a hint regarding
the ongoing ≈500 keV discrepancy in the mass value of the nuclide 70Br, which prevents including
it in the world average of F t-value for superallowed 0+ → 0+ β decays. The reported work sets the
stage for mass measurements with the FRS Ion Catcher of nuclei at and beyond the N=Z line in
the same region of the nuclear chart, including the nuclide 70Br.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear masses are key properties of atomic nuclei, as
they are a measure of the nuclear binding energy, which
reﬂects the details of nuclear structure and forces between
the nucleons. The extension of nuclear mass measure-
ments towards rare, short-lived nuclei far from the valley
of stability is important for widening nuclear structure
models to all regions of the nuclear chart [1, 2] and for
astrophysical nucleosynthesis calculations [3].

Nuclear masses of nuclei around the N=Z line pro-
vide crucial input for determining the path of the rapid
proton-capture (rp-) process that takes place in Type-I
X-ray bursts and steady-state nuclear burning in rapidly
accreting neutron stars [4, 5].

Experimental masses of numerous odd-odd N=Z nu-
clei, which decay via super-allowed 0+ → 0+ β+-
transitions, determine QEC values for these transitions.
These values, together with the half-lives and decay
branching ratios, formulate the F t-values that in turn
test the unitarity of the CKM matrix, a fundamental
principle of the Standard Model [6, 7].

However, the F t-value of 70Br that is derived from its
precise half-life and decay branching ratio [8] and only
direct mass measurement (Penning trap [9]) deviates by
approximately 12σ from the world average. Since the
measurements of Ref.
[8] are accurate enough and not
under dispute, the source of this discrepancy must lie
[9]
in its mass value. The mass measurement of Ref.
diﬀers by approximately 500 keV from that obtained via
positron end-point energy [10], which gives a consistent
F t-value, but with a large uncertainty.

Actually, the Penning trap result was derived from
measuring the mass of the 70mBr isomer (t1/2 = 2.2
s) and subtracting its known excitation energy, because
the cycle time employed in the measurement [9] was
much longer compared to the half-life of the nuclide 70Br
((78.42 ± 0.51) ms [8]). Therefore, the Penning trap
measurement of Ref.
[9] is not included in the current
F t value world average, and a new direct mass measure-
ment of the nuclide 70Br is called for in Ref. [6, 7].

In this article, we focus on insights that can be de-
rived from accurate mass measurements on the interac-
tion strength between the last proton and the last neu-
tron of intermediate-mass nuclei towards the N=Z line.
By ’last’ we refer to the nucleons that occupy the highest
energy orbitals in the nucleus. This interaction strength,
denoted as δVpn, can be deduced from the double dif-
ference of binding energies (obtained directly from mass
measurements) of the nucleus of interest and its neigh-
bors. For odd-odd nuclei with N neutrons and Z protons,
whose binding energy is B(N, Z), the expression is [11]:

of Mines), Dhanbad, Jharkhand 826004, India

2

δVpn(N, Z) =[B(N, Z) − B(N − 1, Z)]

−[B(N, Z − 1) − B(N − 1, Z − 1)]. (1)

Assuming that the nuclear core remains essentially un-
changed in the four nuclei of Eq. 1, such a double dif-
ference largely cancels out the p-p and n-n pairing in-
teractions and the mean ﬁeld component of the binding
energy, isolating the empirical p-n interaction strength
[12–15]. Moreover, δVpn can be used as a sensitive ﬁlter
to study anomalies on the mass surface [16].

It has been predicted that δVpn depends on the spatial
overlap of wave functions of the last neutron and proton
[17]. This prediction seems to be corroborated by exper-
imental data around doubly-magic nuclei [18, 19], and
especially by the dramatic increase of δVpn at N=Z nu-
clei, which is attributed to the manifestation of Wigner’s
SU(4) isospin and spin symmetry [11].

Due to the relation to the overlap of the wave func-
tions, it is expected that for N=Z nuclei (and in general),
δVpn will decrease with increasing Z. This is because of
three cumulative reasons. First, as Z increases, the nu-
clear radii increase, the average distance between the last
proton and neutron increases, and their mutual interac-
tion strength decreases even for nucleons occupying the
same orbitals. Second, as Z increases, the Coulomb force
causes the proton and neutron single-particle energies to
diﬀer even when they are in the same orbital [17]. Third,
the spin-orbit term in the nuclear mean-ﬁeld potential
increases with mass, gradually breaking the spin part of
Wigner’s SU(4) symmetry [11]. The decrease with Z has
been observed experimentally for all measured even-even
nuclei [17] and odd-odd nuclei up to Z=29 [20].

The authors of Ref. [20] note that from Z=29 onwards,
’there is an indication of a trend toward the restrength-
ening of δVpn’. We submit that based on a newer direct
mass measurement of 65As [21] and a very recent indi-
rect mass measurement of 73Rb [22], this restrengthening
trend may be conﬁrmed, as shown in 1, which depicts the
experimental data for N=Z odd-odd nuclei from Z=29 to
Z=37.

For the nuclide 74Rb, we included in Fig. 1 both the
δVpn that is extracted from the AME16 [23] mass value
of 73Rb and that from Ref.
[22], to show how the 2020
measurement emphasizes the restrengthening trend. For
the nuclide 70Br, we included in Fig. 1 both the AME16
value that is based on the Penning trap measurement of
[9], and the older indirect measurement based on positron
endpoint energy [10], due to the approximate 500 keV
discrepancy described above.

The diﬀerent values for the nuclide 70Br give system-
atically diﬀerent local trends of δVpn, either peaking at
this nuclide [10] or ﬂattening out [9] before continuing
to increase towards the nuclide 74Rb. A new mass mea-
surement of the nuclide 70Br and heavier nuclides in the
N≤Z region should resolve the question which is the cor-
rect trend.

74Rb. Black points are experimental data or AME16 [23] evaluations based on experimental data. The red point for the nuclide
74Rb is the AME16 evaluation based on systematics. Hoﬀ 20 refers to [22] and Davids 80 refers to [10].

For the mass measurement of such nuclei, which are
mostly very short-lived (10’s of ms) and with low pro-
duction cross sections, an optimal device is the multiple-
reﬂection time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer (MR-TOF-
MS) [24], which is sensitive even to nuclei that are pro-
duced at rates as low as a few events per hour or day
[25, 26]. The MR-TOF-MS has a unique combination of
performance parameters: fast (cycle times of a few mil-
liseconds), accurate (relative mass-measurement uncer-
tainty down to the 10−8 level), sensitive (only a few de-
tected ions per nucleus are required for accurate mass de-
termination), non-scanning (simultaneous measurement
of many diﬀerent nuclei) and can be used to spatially
resolve isobars and even isomers [26–28].

In this work, we present accurate MR-TOF-MS mass
measurements of the nuclides 69As, 70,71Se and 71Br, all
near the N=Z line. These results help to conﬁrm trends
of δVpn as a function of Z for odd-odd N-Z=2 and N-Z=4
nuclides in the region Z=29-37, which may provide hints
on the expected N=Z δVpn behavior around the nuclide
70Br.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The nuclei presented in this work were produced and
spatially separated at relativistic energies via projectile
fragmentation at the Fragment Separator (FRS) at GSI
[29], and delivered to the FRS Ion Catcher [30] where the
ions were slowed down and thermalized in a gas-ﬁlled
Cryogenic Stopping Cell (CSC) [31–33]. Subsequently,
the ions were extracted and transported via a Radio Fre-
quency Quadrupole (RFQ) beam-line [34, 35] to an MR-
TOF-MS [36, 37], to perform mass measurements and ion
counting [28] with mass resolving powers at full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of almost 1,000,000. We previ-
ously reached a resolving power above 1,000,000 for sta-
ble 133Cs ions with our MR-TOF-MS [38, 39], and this is

the ﬁrst time we approach this value with unstable ions.
The production mechanism was fragmentation of a
124Xe primary beam impinging on a Be target of 4009
mg/cm2 thickness at 982 MeV/u, with intensities up to
3×109 ions per spill and a typical spill length of 2.5 sec-
onds. The FRS was set up in achromatic mode from the
target to the mid focal plane by using a wedge shaped
aluminum degrader (141 mrad, 4005 mg/cm2) at the fo-
cal plane F1. At the mid focal plane a secondary reaction
target was installed. From the mid to the ﬁnal focus the
FRS was set to a dispersive mode. A new degrader sys-
tem, including a variable angle degrader, was used at
the ﬁnal focal plane to range-bunch the ions. The mea-
sured range distribution after range bunching was about
50 mg/cm2 [40]. All nuclides in this work were measured
with the same FRS setting, and only the degrader thick-
ness in the ﬁnal focal plane was changed. In addition to
their accurate mass measurement in the MR-TOF-MS,
the ions were also identiﬁed by the FRS particle ID sys-
tem.

This enabled the parallel operation of two independent
experiments with the same secondary beam - proton de-
caying nuclei were investigated with the EXPERT setup
(see, e.g., [41]) installed after the secondary reaction tar-
get at the mid focal plane, and the longer-living nuclei
that are described in this work were studied at the FRS
Ion Catcher at the ﬁnal focus of the FRS.

The CSC temperature during the experiment was 130
K, higher than the standard working temperature (∼85
K), since the CSC had to be warmed up for repair just
prior to the experiment, and the available cooling time
was not suﬃcient for reaching the standard temperature.
The potential impact of a higher CSC temperature is an
increase of the amount and variety of contaminants in
the buﬀer gas, most of which are frozen at the standard
working temperature. Nevertheless, the total amount of
contaminants in our acquired mass spectra was small,
and their overall eﬀect on our results was minute and

under control. The CSC was operated with an areal den-
sity of 3.3 mg/cm2 and a mean extraction time of about
80 ms.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

We analyzed the data according to the procedure
presented in [28]. Here we emphasize the parts that
were particularly important for this work. The drifts of
the time-of-ﬂight data during the experiment were cor-
rected by performing a time-resolved calibration using a
well-known mass. The peak shape was obtained from
a high-count reference and used for ﬁtting the ion-of-
interest. The analytical function describing the peaks is
the Hyper-EMG [42], and a weighted maximum likeli-
hood estimate (wMLE) was used to ﬁt this function to
the un-binned data. All measured nuclei in this work
were measured as singly-charged positive ions.

The relationship between time-of-ﬂight and mass-to-

charge is deﬁned in equation 2,

m
q

=

c(texp − t0)2
(1 + Nitb)2

(2)

where b = lit/ltfs (lit is the path length for one turn in
the analyzer and ltfs is the path length from the injection
trap to the detector), c = 2Ueﬀ /l2
tfs (Ueﬀ is the eﬀective
voltage), texp is the total measured time-of-ﬂight that
takes into account a time delay between the start signal
and the real start of the ions (t0), and Nit is the number
of turns in the analyzer (see [28] for a more detailed de-
scription). The parameter t0 was common for all the data
analyzed in the context of this work and was determined
to be 274 ± 2 ns.

Mass values were obtained using calibrant ions that
made the same and diﬀerent turn numbers with respect
to the ion-of-interest. We used four stable molecules that
were present in the spectrum and underwent three dif-
ferent turn numbers in the analyzer, and whose relative
mass accuracy δm/m is in the 10−11 level (much better
than the accuracy that we expect for the unstable nu-
clei of interest): 12C5
1H10 (A=70) performing 847 turns,
12C5
1H9 (A=69) performing 853 turns, and 14N15N40Ar
(A=69) and 12C19F3 (A=69) each performing 854 turns.
We always used 12C19F3 (the most abundant peak in the
spectrum) together with two other molecules to perform
the calibration for the mass measurement of the fourth
molecule.

1H10 (A=70) and 12C5

12C5
(A=69) for the same-turn accuracy test, with b) 12C5
and 14N15N40Ar (A=69) to measure 12C5
12C5

In practice, we used 12C19F3 (A=69) together with a)
1H9 to measure 14N15N40Ar
1H10
1H9, and with c)
1H10.
The measurement with the same-turn calibration of
14N15N40Ar (A=69) showed a deviation from literature
of (0.6 ± 1.1) keV, which represents a relative mass uncer-
tainty 1.7×10−8. For the multi-turn calibration, the mea-

1H9 and 14N15N40Ar (A=69) to measure 12C5

1H10 and 12C5

surement of 12C5
1H9 resulted in a deviation
from literature of (-1.2 ± 2.9) keV (δm/m of 4.4×10−8)
and (0.9 ± 2.9) keV (δm/m of 4.5 ×10−8), respectively,
with only about 300 events for each molecule.

The above analyses of the molecular masses show that
both of our calibration procedures (same-turn and multi-
turn) provide accuracy in the low 10−8 level. We have
reached in the past relative uncertainties of 6.0×10−8
with our system, but then it was achieved with approxi-
mately 6000 events [28]. The relative mass uncertainty of
1.7 ×10−8 achieved for 14N15N40Ar (A=69) in this work
is the most accurate measurement yet performed with
an MR-TOF-MS, due to our unprecedented mass resolv-
ing power of almost 1,000,000 FWHM. The uncertainty
evaluation of the molecules and unstable nuclides of this
work include all the systematic contributions that were
presented in Ref. [28].

IV. RESULTS

A. Mass Measurement of the nuclide 69As

The mass of the nuclide 69As has been previously mea-
sured only indirectly, via the endpoint energy of its β+
decay [43, 44] and the endpoint energy of its mother nu-
cleus (the nuclide 69Se) β+ decay [44]. The values from
these three measurements (with uncertainties of 50 keV)
present some inconsistency with each other, but never-
theless the value at AME16 is a weighted average of them,
with a minor weight from the β+ decay of the nuclide 69Se
[45], and an overall uncertainty of 30 keV [23].

In this work, we performed the ﬁrst direct mass mea-
surement of the nuclide 69As. The acquired data with
the MR-TOF-MS contained only 10 events, highlighting
the sensitivity of our system, as can be seen in the left
side of Fig. 2. The total time-of-ﬂight for this measure-
ment was about 23.1 ms and the 69As ions performed 901
turns inside the analyzer.

Calibration was obtained with the molecular isobar
12C19F3 (A=69), which performed the same number of
turns as the 69As ion. Some of these molecules are pro-
duced by ionization in the CSC and others from the elec-
tron impact source of the MR-TOF-MS (fragment of the
molecule C3F8).

The 10 events of the nuclide 69As were acquired in
40 minutes. When setting the degrader thickness in the
FRS ﬁnal focal plane to stop A=70 nuclides in CSC, we
measured also the A=69 region for about 5 hours and
did not observe any events in the mass region of the nu-
clide 69As. This provided conﬁdence that the acquired
10 events are all 69As nuclides. Nevertheless, presence of
unknown contamination in the peak could not be com-
pletely ruled out, and was thus taken into account in
the uncertainty evaluation, according to the procedure
described in Ref. [28].

Due to the low number of events, the mass uncertainty
of the nuclide 69As is dominated by statistics and a minor

5

contribution from possible unknown contamination, be-
cause of the relatively low amount of unidentiﬁed peaks
in the entire mass spectrum [28]. Its overall value is 22
keV, corresponding to a relative accuracy of δm/m =
2.8×10−7.

The mass-excess value and uncertainty of the nuclide
69As from this work are given in Table I and are compared
to the AME16 value and previous indirect measurements
in Fig. 3. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that our result resolves
the discrepancy between the previous indirect mass mea-
surements of the nuclide 69As.

given in AME16 [23] in Fig. 3. It can be seen in Fig. 3
that our result is consistent with previous high accuracy
measurements and has a precision similar to the best one.
Our relative uncertainty for the nuclide 70Se is similar
to the best relative uncertainty recorded so far for an
unstable nucleus by an MR-TOF-MS, δm/m = 3.5×10−8
for 65Ga in GARIS-II at RIKEN [50]. Notice that our
level of uncertainty was obtained with almost a factor
of 40 less events due to the much higher mass resolving
power in our MR-TOF-MS.

B. Mass Measurement of the nuclide 70Se

The mass of the nuclide 70Se has been previously mea-
sured both indirectly and directly. The direct measure-
ments have been performed with time-of-ﬂight (GANIL
[46, 47]), Penning traps (ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE/CERN
[48] and LEBIT at NSCL [9]) and isochronous mass mea-
surements (ESR at GSI [49]). The AME16 [23] mass
value and uncertainty (1.6 keV) are based mainly on the
results from Ref. [9]. The more recent Penning trap re-
sult is consistent with [9] but with a larger uncertainty
(17 keV) [48]. The isochronous measurement result [49]
has a large uncertainty (70 keV) and deviates by 2σ from
the measurements with the Penning traps. The direct
time-of-ﬂight results are with even larger uncertainties,
130 keV [46] and 460 keV [47], and both are consistent
with the Penning trap measurements.

In this work we performed the ﬁrst mass measurement
of the nuclide 70Se with an MR-TOF-MS. The total num-
ber of accumulated events is 485 with 2 diﬀerent turn
numbers (848 and 895) with a total TOF of about 21.9
and 23.1 ms, respectively.

In the data sets where the 70Se ion underwent 848
turns, an isobaric molecule 13C19F3 (A=70) undergo-
ing also 848 turns (produced partially in the CSC and
partially from the electron impact source in the MR-
TOF-MS) was used as a calibrant. In the measurement
with 895 turns the ion of interest performed a diﬀerent
number of turns than the calibrant. Therefore, an ac-
curate multi-turn calibration was performed by the de-
termination of the parameter c (see Eq. 2) using other
singly charged species performing diﬀerent turn numbers,
1H9
namely: 12C5
(A=69) performing 853 turns and 14N15N40Ar (A=69)
and 12C19F3 (A=69) performing 854 turns.

1H10 (A=70) performing 847 turns, 12C5

The parameter b (see Eq.2) was determined in
the diﬀerent measurements from 12C19F3 (A=69) or
14N15N40Ar (A=69) performing 854 turns. Following the
procedure described in [28], an uncertainty of 2.6 keV was
obtained, which corresponds to a relative accuracy δm/m
of 4.0×10−8. A sample spectrum containing 256 counts
is shown in Fig. 2.

The mass-excess value and uncertainty of the nuclide
70Se from this work are given in Table I and are com-
pared together with previous measurements to the value

C. Mass Measurement of the nuclide 71Se

The mass of the nuclide 71Se has been previously mea-
sured both indirectly and directly. The direct measure-
ments have been performed with time-of-ﬂight (GANIL
[46, 47]), Penning trap (ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE/CERN
[48]) and isochronous mass measurements (ESR at GSI
[49]). The AME16 [23] mass value and uncertainty (2.8
keV) are based mainly on the results from Ref. [48]. The
isochronous measurement result [49] has a large uncer-
tainty (70 keV) and deviates by 1.3σ from the Penning
trap measurements. The direct time-of-ﬂight results have
even larger uncertainties, 112 keV [46] and 317 keV [47],
and both are consistent with the Penning trap measure-
ments (see Fig. 3 for a comparison with AME16).

The mass of the nuclide 71Se was measured with only
7 counts. The ions underwent 895 turns in about 23.1
ms. There was no same-turn calibration possible and the
measurement was performed calculating the parameter
c (see Eq. 2) from the multi-turn calibration used with
70Se and using 13C19F3 (A=70) as a precision calibrant,
which performed 6 turns more than 71Se (901 turns). The
uncertainty achieved was 23 keV or a relative mass accu-
racy δm/m of 3.4×10−7, where the main contributions
are statistical error and a non-perfect correction of the
TOF drifts.

D. Mass Measurement of the nuclide 71Br

Due to its closest location to the N=Z line, the mass
of the nuclide 71Br has been previously measured only
twice, by time-of-ﬂight (GANIL [46]) and a Penning trap
(LEBIT at NSCL [9]). The AME16 mass value and un-
certainty (5.4 keV) are based solely on the results of Ref.
[9]. The time-of-ﬂight result has a much larger uncer-
tainty, 570 keV [46], which is consistent with the value
from Ref. [9]. The comparison can be seen in Fig. 3.

The measurement of the nuclide 71Br included a total
of 19 counts. The ions underwent 895 turns in about 23.1
ms. This nuclide was measured together with the nuclide
71Se and the same calibration procedure was performed.
The mass is in good agreement with the one presented
in AME16 and presents an uncertainty of 16 keV or a
relative mass accuracy δm/m of 2.5×10−7.

V. DISCUSSION

values.

The proton-neutron interaction strength for N=Z nu-
clei, δVpn(N=Z), is expected to decrease with increasing
mass (see Section I [11, 17]) whereas recent mass mea-
surements show a restrengthening of this parameter in
the range Z=29-37, as depicted in Fig. 1. This could be
explained by various physical phenomena, including the
amount of overlap between wave functions of valence pro-
tons and neutrons [17–19], the growth of deformation in
nuclei [14, 52], and the manifestation of Wigner’s SU(4)
symmetry at N=Z nuclei [11].

In order to discern which interpretation may be behind
the surprising trend in δVpn(N=Z), we applied the mea-
sured masses of this work and corresponding data from
AME16 [23] and primary literature [43, 44] to calculate
the quantity δVpn for N-Z=2 and N-Z=4 nuclides in the
proton number range Z=29-37. The results are shown in
Fig. 4.

From comparing Fig. 4 to Fig. 1, it is observed that
δVpn(N=Z) is much higher (up to a factor of almost 3)
than the values for N-Z=2 and N-Z=4, as expected [11].
Our new direct measurement of the nuclide 69As conﬁrms
an essentially monotonic increase of δVpn staggering as
a function of Z, as one moves away from N=Z towards
N-Z=2 and N-Z=4. It is thus evident that the signiﬁcant
restrengthening of δVpn (approximately 1200 keV, see
Fig. 1) is a sole characteristic of the N=Z nuclei. The
N-Z=2 net increase is only about 200 keV in the same
range, and at N-Z=4 there is staggering that ends with
a net decrease of approximately 100 keV in the overall
range.

in Section I, Wigner’s spin-isospin SU(4) symmetry is
known to be broken in heavier nuclei [11, 17]. Never-
theless, it has been proposed that protons and neutrons
occupying the pf-shell above the magic number 28
exhibit a pseudo-SU(4) symmetry [53], which follows
from the combined invariance in pseudospin and isospin.
Pseudospin is deﬁned for the pf-shell orbitals as a
reduction by one unit of angular momentum, so they
behave as pseudo sd-shell orbitals. Therefore, their
pseudospin-orbit

The pseudo-SU(4) scheme has been used for a qual-
itative understanding of the observed Gamow-Teller β-
decay of pf-shell nuclei [53]. The authors of Ref.
[53]
stated that pseudo-SU(4) could be tested via the trend
of δVpn(N=Z) values in the pf-shell. However, the needed
mass measurements were lacking at that time. The ex-
perimental information that is presented here emphasizes
the unique behavior of the N=Z nuclei in the pf-shell and
can contribute to the test of the pseudo-SU(4) concept.
It is interesting to study also the detailed structure
of δVpn as a function of Z for the N-Z=2 and N-Z=4
nuclei. The accurate measurements reveal the staggering
and overall increase in δVpn from the Cu (Z=29) isotopes
to the Br (Z=35) isotopes, and show the beginning of
a decrease at the Rb (Z=37) isotopes. Since the δVpn
values beyond the closed shell 28 seem to be inﬂuenced
by the shell correction and by deformation changes in the
four neighboring nuclei, these results may provide input
to detailed calculations of nuclear deformation [16].

Some detailed aspects of the δVpn trends of N-Z=4,
N-Z=2 and N=Z nuclei may be similar. The most strik-
ing feature in the N-Z=4 and N-Z=2 trends may be the
maximal value of δVpn at the Br isotopes. If one assumes
that this structure is maintained also at N=Z, then Fig.
1 indicates that the ’correct’ value for the mass of the
nuclide 70Br is closer to the indirect mass measurement
[10] rather than the more recent Penning trap measure-
ment [9]. Such a suggested ’peak’ at the nuclide 70Br
may be connected to the observed transition from spher-
ical to deformed nuclear shapes along the N=Z line at
Z=35 [54]. Recall that the indirect mass result of 70Br
[10] also leads to a F t-value that is consistent with the
world average [6].

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we present the mass measurement of four
very-neutron-deﬁcient nuclides with the MR-TOF-MS at
the FRS Ion Catcher at GSI, with an unprecedented mass
resolving power of almost 1,000,000. This is a very im-
portant milestone for mass measurements of rare short-
lived nuclides, since high resolving power is the only way
to achieve the required uncertainties and resolve over-
lapping peaks when the number of accumulated events
is inherently limited. We performed the ﬁrst direct mass

measurement of the nuclide 69As, and the ﬁrst MR-TOF-
MS mass measurements of the nuclides 70,71Se and 71Br.
We carried out these measurements simultaneously
with another experiment that used the same secondary
beam to study proton decaying nuclei at the mid-focal
plane of the FRS. This is an important demonstration of
eﬃcient use of rare ion beams that are currently in great
demand at large accelerator facilities.

For the nuclide 70Se, we reached a relative mass uncer-
tainty of δm/m = 4.0×10−8 with less than 500 events,
similar to the best ever measurement of an unstable nu-
cleus with an MR-TOF-MS [50]. For the other three
nuclides, we reached a relative mass uncertainty of about
2 × 10−7 with less than 20 events. All our results are in
good agreement with the AME16 values.

We measured the mass of the molecule 14N15N40Ar
(A=69) with a relative accuracy of δm/m = 1.7×10−8,
the highest yet achieved with an MR-TOF-MS.

Our ﬁrst direct measurement of the nuclide 69As has a
better uncertainty than both previous indirect measure-
ments and the AME16 evaluation. Therefore, our results
signiﬁcantly increase the conﬁdence in all four AME16
values, and the consequential conclusions of the nuclear
structure and astrophysics models that rely on them.

Our results impact (the nuclide 69As) and conﬁrm (the
nuclides 70,71Se, 71Br) interesting trends in the proton-
neutron interaction strength δVpn for N-Z=2 and N-Z=4
in the Z=29-37 range, which singled out the N=Z nuclei
in this region as exhibiting the restrengthening of δVpn
with increasing Z, in contrast with the expected behav-
ior. Further, the maximal δVpn value at the Br isotopes
with N-Z=2 and N-Z=4 may indicate that the indirect
mass measurement [10] of the nuclide 70Br may be more
consistent with the regional δVpn trend than the Penning

trap measurement [9]. This gives another important in-
centive to re-measure the mass of this nuclide, in addition
to the apparent deviation of its QEC from the value that
is consistent with the F t world average [6, 7]. From the
technical point of view, the high accuracy achieved in the
measurements of this work with a small number of events
ensure that the MR-TOF-MS at the FRS Ion Catcher at
GSI is ready for accurate measurements of the masses
of rare N≤Z nuclides in the A≈70 region. In particular,
our mass measurement of the nuclide 71Br shows that our
system is able to extract the specially reactive element
bromine, and thus our path to measure the nuclide 70Br
and heavier N=Z nuclides is open and will be realized.
