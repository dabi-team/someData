Abstract

Using results of our exact description of the spinless fermion motion in a nonho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B = B(0, 0, 1/cosh2( x−x0
)) we study a gas of these
particles moving in this ﬁeld. For lower densities ν < νc(B, δ) the corresponding
total energy is lower than that of the uniform ﬁeld state. Thus when the density
of anyons decreases a transition from the uniform statistical ﬁeld state to the
nonhomogeneous ﬁeld state is predicted.

Non-Abelian anyons and topological quantum computation has recently emerged
as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quan-
tum computer [1]. Strongly correlated quantum systems can exhibit behavior
called topological order which is characterized by non-local correlations that
depend on the system topology. Such systems can exhibit phenomena such as
quasi-particles with anyonic statistics and have been proposed as candidates for
naturally fault-tolerant quantum computation. Despite these remarkable prop-
erties, anyons have not been observed in the year 2008 directly [2]. Recently
it was presented an experimental emulation of creating anyonic excitations in
a superconducting circuit that consists of four qubits, achieved by dynamically
generating the ground and excited states of the toric code model, i.e., four-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The anyonic braiding is implemented via
single-qubit rotations: a phase shift of
related to braiding, the hallmark of
Abelian 1/2 anyons, has been observed through a Ramsey-type interference
measurement [3].

Neverthless it is interesting to study spinless fermion motion in a nonhomo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld B = B(0, 0, 1/cosh2( x−x0
)) of these particles moving in
this ﬁeld. For lower densities ν < νc(B, δ) the corresponding total energy is
lower than that of the uniform ﬁeld state. Thus when the density of anyons
decreases a transition from the uniform statistical ﬁeld state to the nonhomoge-
neous ﬁeld state is predicted. When the density of anyons present in this system
decreases a transition from the uniform statistical ﬁeld state to the nonhomo-
geneous ﬁeld state is predicted. This may forward our observation possibilities
to observe anyon properties.

δ

An homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B = ( 0, 0, B) strongly inﬂuences states of
charged fermions moving in an x-y plane perpendicular to the ﬁeld direction.
Landau energy levels and their degeneracy characterize this motion, [4]. A gas
of free spinless fermions has its total energy ET (B, ν) larger or equal to its total
energy ET (0, ν) = 2πtN ν2 in the zero ﬁeld:

a is a characteristic length of the system, its value is of the order of a lattice
constant value. The energy level degeneracy occurs only if a number of Landau
levels is completely ﬁlled (e.i. if for some n νn = ν). Recently it was shown in [5]
that in the presence of a periodic lattice potential the ground state energy of a
gas of spinless fermions in an uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the ﬁlled
lowest Landau level is lower than that in zero ﬁeld. This problem was studied

further in context of commensurate ﬂux phases, [6].
If a nonhomogeneity of
the ﬁeld is introduced by a local ﬁeld intensity decrease then competition of two
tendencies is expected to occur: a decrease of the single fermion energy level due
to decreased value of the ﬁeld and a decrease of the every energy level degeneracy
due to larger spacing between centers of neighboring orbits within the region
of smaller ﬁelds. Spectrum of 2d Bloch electrons in a periodic magnetic ﬁeld
was studied in [7]. Using semiclassical methods authors of this later paper
investigated the case where the magnetic unit cell is commensurate with the
lattice unit cell. Their work is in some sense extension of previous studies of free
electrons in periodic magnetic ﬁeld [8] to the lattice case. Our aim in this paper
is to present results of our study of the motion of a spinless fermion gas bounded
to the square LxL in a nonhomogeneous static magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to this plane. We neglect the lattice periodic potential inﬂuence on the gas
energy spectrum in this paper. We consider in more details the limit in which
nonhomogeneity disappears and a uniform ﬁeld appears. In diﬀerence to [7], [8]
and [9] we do not consider a periodic magnetic ﬁeld. Recently, [10], an exact
description of motion of the quantum spinless fermion in a nonhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld described by the vector potential A = (0, Bδtanh( x−x0
), 0) was
found. We use these results in this paper to study the stability of the statistical
uniform anyon state with respect to a nonuniform ﬁeld state. Firstly using the
single fermion energy from [10] we ﬁnd a total energy of a gas of spinless fermions
moving in our nonhomogeneous ﬁeld. Then we compare this energy with the
total energy of the same gas moving in the uniform ﬁeld with the same intensity
B. We have found that at low densities ν < νc(B, δ) the nonhomogeneous ﬁeld
state of the anyon gas is preferred. Occurence of such a kind of instability has
consequences for interpretation of recent experiments [11] searching for the T-
and P- symmetry breaking phenomena due to presence of particles with exotic
statistics - anyons.

δ

In the case of motion of a quantum spinless fermion in a nonhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld described by the vector potential A = (0, Bδtanh( x−x0
), 0) the
energy spectrum of the motion in the x-direction is splitted, see in [10], into
a discrete and a continuous parts for general values of the ﬁeld B and of the
nonhomogeneity parameter δ. We take x0 = 0 in the following, thus ﬁeld has
its maximum intensity at x = 0. Let us consider the limit of strong ﬁelds (F
≡
2π Φ
Bδ2) in which case a linear type nonhomogeneity is
localized near the two edges x =
L/2, if δ >> a keeping L ﬁnite. In this limit
it is suﬃcient to take into account the lowest energy levels of the spectrum. The
eigenvalues of the energy corresponding to this part of the spectrum are given
by, see in [10] :

Here DL ≡
hc N is the Landau level degeneracy as it is given in the case
of the uniform ﬁeld. The form of the degeneracy Dn given above holds for all
orders of F. However, the large F expansion in (2) limits its validity to the
region of system parameters given by the inequality below (3). This inequality
follows from the usual, [12], boundary conditions: periodicity in the y-direction
perpendicular to the x-axis and limits on the position of the orbit center in the
x-direction to the region <
L/2, +L/2 > . The orbit center x-coordinate xc is
given, [10], by

tanh(xc/δ) = ( −

Note that this relation also reﬂects the fact that closed particle orbits of their
motion in our magnetic ﬁeld do exist only in the limited region of system param-
momentum such that tanh function above is note larger
eters and of the py −
(or smaller) than 1 (than -1).

Straightforward calculations of the ground state energy ET (B, δ, ν) for spin-
less fermion gas with density ν in the limit of strong but nonhomogeneous ﬁelds
speciﬁed by B, δ lead to the modiﬁcation of (1). We have found that the energy

When only the lowest energy level n = 0 is ﬁlled partially we ﬁnd from (4)

lowest energy level n = 0 corresponds with the density ν given by:

ν1

L

(7)

It follows from (7) that there is a decrease of the number of n = 0 states with
respect to the uniform ﬁeld case. In this later case the density at which the
Φ
n = 0 state is ﬁlled is given by ν1 ≡
Φ0 . Moreover in our limit of large but still
nonhomogeneous ﬁelds the quantity ν1 satisﬁes the inequality given above (2).
Let us now compare total energies of our gas at a given density ν between the
n = 0 state in the uniform ﬁeld B and the n = 0 state in the nonhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld B with a ﬁnite parameter δ. We obtain from (1) and (6) that
their total energy diﬀerence is given by:

It follows from (8) that in this range of densities and of system parameters values
the nonhomogeneous ﬁeld state has lower energy than that in the homogeneous
ﬁeld.

Let us now increase the gas density ν to the value ν1. The lowest energy level
of the uniform ﬁeld state becomes ﬁlled. Let us assume that the nonhomogeneity
parameter δ is large enough and such that the following inequalities hold:

Then the n = 0 level of the nonhomogeneous ﬁeld case is ﬁlled completely and
the n = 1 level of the same case only partially. Let us compare energies of the
uniform ﬁeld state and of the nonhomogeneous state for the density ν1 = ν. We
obtain for the diﬀerence of the total energies of both states::

This quantity is positive for macroscopically nonvanishing density ν. Decrease
of the single fermion energy due to the nonhomogeneity is overcompensated by
the decrease of the number of particles in the n = 0 nonhomogeneous ﬁeld level
and by their increase in the n = 1 level. The gap between energies of these two
levels is

¯h2
mδ2 + O(1/F ),

¯hω

−

the increase of the number of particles in the n = 1 level increases substantially
the total energy of the system. Thus the uniform ﬁeld state becomes preferred
at higher particle densities. Qualitatively the same type of conclusions holds for
higher densities ν and higher level numbers n.

We conclude that the nonhomogeneous ﬁeld state of our gas of spinless
fermions is preferred with respect to the uniform ﬁeld state of the same gas
for densities ν less or equal to a critical value νc(B, δ) deﬁned as

νc(B, δ)

tanh( L

For higher densities ν > νc(B, δ) the later state is preferred.

One may ask at which value of the nonhomogeneity parameter δ the energy
ET (B, δ, ν)
diﬀerence (8) takes the largest value. The diﬀerence ET (B, ν)
from (8) becomes larger when ( L
δ )2 is increasing quantity, e.i. when δ
decreases with respect to the the length L. There exists a critical value of δ given
L/ln(πN ν1),. It is that limiting value of δ for which the inequality below
by δc ≡
(3) becomes equality. Below δc the degeneracy of every energy level becomes n-
dependent [10] as it follows from py dependence of nmax given in the beggining
of this paper. It is possible to ﬁnd that

The density ν in (8) is for the n = 0 state now from the region:

−

≥

ν > 0.

We have found that for such more localized nonhomogeneity of the ﬁeld for
which δ is smaller, δ < δc, the energy diﬀerence depends on (L/2δ) in the same
way as in (8). The maximum value of this diﬀerence for the ﬁlled lowest level
n = 0 of the nonhomogeneous ﬁeld state is obtained for δ = a(3/2πν1)1/2 as:

ET (B, ν)

−

ET (B, δ, ν) = (4t√N /3)ν√πν1/6.

The gas density corresponding to this value is found to be ν = (√6
−
2
3 )pν1/πN . This density corresponds to nonzero linear density of particles,
Nf /√N . Thus we conclude that in our type of the nonhomogeneous ﬁeld the
energy diﬀerence (8) is maximized for small densities of particles. One can say
that it is an edge eﬀect which leads to the maximum of the considered energy
diﬀerence.

Let us discuss shortly consequences of our results obtained above for the
anyon gas physics. According to [9] and [13] anyons may be described as spin-
less fermions moving in the statistical ﬁeld generated by the statistical potential
Ai acting on the i-th anyon and given by:
ρ)(¯hc/e)z x Σj6=i(ri

is a result of the averaging of the potential Ai given above over some stationary
conﬁgurations of anyons which are diﬀerent from those which lead to the uniform
statistical ﬁeld. Such a modulated form of the average potential may results
from Ai when fermions are non- homogeneously distributed within the plane.
From our results described above for the gas of spinless fermions moving in
our nonhomogeneous ﬁeld it follows that for the anyon densities ν such that

holds ( where ν, L, δ are ﬁxed parameters ) the uniform statistical ﬁeld state
is unstable with respect to the state with nonhomogeneous statistical ﬁeld de-
scribed by our potential. Our comparison of the total energies between the non-
homogeneous ﬁeld state and the uniform ﬁeld state as given above shows that
the former is preferred at zero temperature. This instability eﬀect of the uniform
statistical ﬁeld state is larger for smaller densities. However it is present also
for macroscopically nonvanishing density of particles. For densities of anyons ν
the uniform statistical ﬁeld state is preferred for anyons.
higher than ν1
It is however not clear from our results whether our nonhomogeneous ﬁeld is the
most stable nonhomogeneous ﬁeld state of anyons at lower densities of particles.
In our calculations we may consider the characteristic length L to be either the
linear dimension of the sample either it may be a characteristic length of a do-
main within the sample. In the later case the whole sample is expected to be
covered by similar domains. From (8) it follows that the most preferred value
of the nonhomogeneity parameter δ is that value for which ν = νc(B, δ) when
the enrgy diﬀerence between both considered states becomes maximized.

Thus we see that our results are directly related to the physics of anyons.
Experimental evidence for presence of these new physical phenomena in real
materials is controversial nowadays. There exists some positive evidence for
observation of broken T- and/or P- symmetry in superconductors based on
oxidic layers, [11]. Some of these experimental results are interpreted, however,
as a negative evidence or there is no their clear interpretation. Our results
presented here may contribute to better understanding why there exists variety
of diﬀerent results obtained under diﬀerent physical conditions and in diﬀerent
samples in cited above experiments. If the statistical ﬁeld varies in the sample
then also measured physical quantities such as the optical axis rotation angle
will vary within the CuO2 plane in cuprate perovskites as it may be found f.e.
from the results of analysis in [14] of rotation of polarized light reﬂected from
T- and P- violating phases. According to results presented in this paper in
those samples in which higher densities of charge carriers occur the uniform
statistical ﬁeld anyon state may be realized. In those samples where the density
of anyons is below some critical value νc the anyon statistical ﬁeld becomes
spatially modulated. Whether this modulation is described by the statistical
ﬁeld considered in our calculations remains an open problem. Here we have
shown only that such a transition exists, from our results we are not able to say
which type of ﬁeld modulation represents the true ground state of anyons. We
may expect that some other than our modulation may lead to energetically (
we consider T=0 ) more preferred anyon state.

Results of this paper point to principal possibility that a phase transition
between anyon states: uniform statistical ﬁeld state and modulated statistical

10

ﬁeld state occurs when the carrier density is decreased. Such a phase transition
may be experimentally observed under appropriate conditions. Physical prop-
erties of modulated states as well as their response to external signals probing
their nature should be established in other to improve our understanding of the
experimental situation in search of broken T-/P- symmetries due to presence of
anyons. It is known, [15], that dynamic response of fermions in continuum as
well as on the lattice in a magnetic ﬁeld may be calculated. This task is beyond
the scope of this paper.
