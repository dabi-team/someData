Abstract. We show an analogy at high curvature between a f (R) = R + aRn−1 + bR2
theory and the α-Attractors. We calculate the expressions of the parameters a, b and n as
functions of α and the predictions of the model f (R) = R+aRn−1 +bR2 on the scalar spectral
index ns and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We ﬁnd that the power law correction Rn−1 allows
for a production of gravitational waves enhanced with respect to the one in the Starobinsky
model, while maintaining a viable prediction on ns. We numerically reconstruct the full
α-Attractors class of models testing the goodness of our high-energy approximation f (R) =
R + aRn−1 + bR2. Moreover, we also investigate the case of a single power law f (R) = γR2−δ
theory, with γ and δ free parameters. We calculate analytically the predictions of this model
on the scalar spectral index ns and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and the values of δ which are
allowed from the current observational results. We ﬁnd that −0.015 < δ < 0.016, conﬁrming
once again the excellent agreement between the Starobinsky model and observation.

After almost 40 years, the inﬂationary theory [1–4] has become an important piece of our un-
derstanding of the primordial universe, given its ability to solve some of the puzzles plaguing
the standard cosmological model (e.g. the ﬂatness and the horizon problems) and given its
ability to make predictions on the primordial power spectrum, which can be tested through
observation of the cosmic background radiation (CMB) [5, 6]. Since the ﬁrst inﬂationary
solution, proposed by Starobinsky in Ref. [1], see also [7, 8], many other proposals have been
put forward.1 These have been classiﬁed and statistically analysed in many works, see e.g.
Refs. [9–14], and the result is that data favour the simplest category of inﬂationary models:
single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation, with a plateau potential. The typical representative of this
class of models is the Starobinsky model [1], which can be expressed within the framework
of f (R) theories [15] as the following quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action:

f (R) = R +

R2
6M 2 ,

(1.1)

where M is an arbitrary energy scale, typically M ∼ 1013 GeV [16]. As any f (R), the model
(1.1) also can be transformed in a scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame and, through a
conformal transformation, to a minimally coupled (to the conformally transformed metric)
canonical scalar ﬁeld.

The predictions of the Starobinsky model on the fundamental inﬂationary parameters,

i.e. the scalar spectral index ns and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r are:

ns − 1 = −

2
N

,

r =

12
N 2 ,

(1.2)

at the leading order of powers of 1/N , where N is the number of e-folds and whose typical
value is N (cid:38) 60, which is required in order to solve the ﬂatness and the horizon problems
[17]. Choosing N = 60 in Eq. (1.2) we get

ns = 0.967 ,

r = 3.33 × 10−3 .

(1.3)

1In Ref. [9] 193 single-ﬁeld inﬂationary models are analysed.

– 1 –

These predictions are in very good agreement with the latest Planck results [6]:

ns = 0.968 ± 0.006 ,

r < 0.11 ,

(1.4)

the former constraint being at 68% conﬁdence level (CL) and the latter at 95% CL. The
looseness of the second constraint is due to our current inability to detect the B-mode of
CMB polarisation, which carries crucial information about the primordial gravitational wave
background and thus, through its spectrum, on the energy scale of Inﬂation.

The looseness of the constraint on r might be threatening to the primacy of the Starobin-
sky model in the panorama of all the inﬂationary, single-ﬁeld, models of Inﬂation for if, for
example, a suﬃciently large r was eventually detected then the Starobinsky model would be
ruled out. In this sense it is interesting to explore new theoretical scenarios which do not
pin the value of r alongside with that of ns, as it happens for the Starobinsky model, cf.
Eq. (1.2).

As an example of these scenarios, recently a new class of inﬂationary models dubbed
α-Attractors has been proposed in Refs. [18–20]. These provide the following predictions on
the inﬂationary parameters:

ns = 1 −

2
N

,

r =

12α
N 2 ,

(1.5)

where α > 0 and, as in Eq. (1.2), the leading order only in the expansion in powers of 1/N has
been retained. Remarkably, the predictions in the above Eq. (1.5) are very similar to those
in Eq. (1.2) of the Starobinsky model, so that the excellent agreement with observation as
for the parameter ns is maintained while being there freedom to tune the gravitational wave
production through the parameter α. When the latter is unity, one recovers the Starobinsky
model, whereas when α → ∞ one recovers the inﬂationary paradigm of a non-interacting,
massive canonical scalar ﬁeld [18].

The α-Attractors theories are most naturally formulated in the context of Supergravity
with logarithmic K¨ahler potential. In this sense, a comparison with the Starobinsky model
would be more direct and clearer if we had an f (R) theory which could provide the same
predictions as in Eq. (1.5). In particular, we address the following question: how should we
modify the Starobinsky model in the f (R) framework in order to have a larger production
of gravitational waves? Therefore, we reconstruct a f (R) theory which could mimic the
α-Attractors scalar potential, given in Eq. (2.10), in the following way. From the latter
we obtain a diﬀerential equation for f (R), cf. Eq. (2.11), already found in Ref. [21], and
which provides the corresponding f (R) theory. Unfortunately, this equation can be solved
analytically in order to obtain an explicit form of f (R) only for very speciﬁc values of α,
as done in Ref. [21]. Therefore, we analyse its asymptotic behaviour for high energies and
show that a solution of the type f (R) = R + aRn−1 + bR2, i.e. a power law extension of
the Starobinsky model, does exist. Motivated by this asymptotic solution, we study in more
detail the model f (R) = R + aRn−1 + bR2 calculating its predictions on the inﬂationary
parameters ns and r. We ﬁnd that the parameters a, b and n can all be related to one single
parameter β and that the model is viable for −0.02 < β < 0.8. The parameter β is related
to the α of the α-Attractors by β = 1 − 1/
α. In the appendix we address again Eq. (2.11)
solving it numerically and showing the goodness of our asymptotic approximation.

√

Moreover, motivated by Ref. [22] we also study in more detail the model f (R) = γR2−δ,
calculating analytically its predictions on the inﬂationary parameters ns and r. We ﬁnd that

– 2 –

the f (R) = γR2−δ models are viable for −0.015 < δ < 0.016 and do not share with the
α-Attractors the ability of moving vertically in the plane ns vs r.

It must be said that the above-proposed corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action are
valid only for Inﬂation, thus on very large energy scales, since it has been shown in [23]
that corrections of the type R1+(cid:15) require 0 ≤ (cid:15) ≤ 7.2 × 10−19, from the Mercury perihelion
precession observations.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we brieﬂy emphasise the importance of f (R)
theories, and especially of the Starobinsky model, in the context of Inﬂation via a simpliﬁed
dynamical system analysis, and we introduce the α-Attractors class of models. Then, from
the α-Attractors potential we derive the diﬀerential equation for f (R), cf. Eq. (2.11), which
allows to put in correspondence a f (R) theory with the α-Attractors. In Sec. 3 we analyse
in detail the model f (R) = R + aRn−1 + bR2 and show its predictions on the inﬂationary
parameters. In Sec. 4 we address in detail the model f (R) = γR2−δ and show the analytic
derivation of its prediction on the inﬂationary parameters. Finally, in Sec. 5 we present our
conclusions. In the Appendix A we numerically analyse in detail Eq. (2.11).

Throughout the paper we use G = c = 1 units.

f (R) theory, Starobinsky model and Inﬂation

We start this section by brieﬂy reviewing how an f (R) theory is able to provide a viable
inﬂationary model. Let’s start with the following action:

S =

(cid:90)

M 2
Pl
2

√

d4x

−gf (R) ,

(2.1)

where MPl is the Planck mass. Following e.g. Ref. [24], see also Ref. [25], one can show
that the above f (R) action (2.1) is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert one with a minimally
coupled (to the conformally transformed metric) canonical scalar ﬁeld χ, deﬁned as follows:

χ =

and subject to the following potential:

U =

M 2
Pl
2(df /dR)2

(cid:18)

R

df
dR

(cid:19)

− f

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

At this point one can already see why the Starobinsky model [26] f (R) = R + R2/(6M 2) is
special. Assume for example a R + γRn theory, with n > 0 and where γ is some energy scale
at which the correction becomes relevant. At high energy scales γRn (cid:29) R, where we expect
Inﬂation to take place, the potential U becomes:

U =

M 2

Pl(n − 1)
2γn2

R2−n .

(2.4)

The Starobinsky case n = 2 then provides a plateau, which is the ideal situation for a slow-
roll inﬂationary phase to take place. If n > 2 the potential initially increases and then goes
to zero asymptotically, which might be bad from the point of view of Inﬂation because the
slow-rolling scalar ﬁeld would need to overcome a potential barrier. For n < 2 the potential
grows unbound, but still there is the possibility for it to satisfy the slow-roll conditions. See
Refs. [27–29].

2.1 Dynamical system perspective

Let us analyse the above-described asymptotic behaviours from a dynamical system perspec-
tive. Assume a spatially ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric:

ds2 = −dt2 + a(t)2δijdxidxj .

(2.5)

It is not diﬃcult to cast the evolution equations of f (R) gravity in absence of matter as the
following dynamical system:

(cid:40)

6Hf (cid:48)(cid:48) ˙R = Rf (cid:48) − f − 6f (cid:48)H 2
6 ˙H = R − 12H 2

,

(2.6)

where H ≡ ˙a/a, the dot denotes derivation with respect to the cosmic time and the prime
denotes derivation with respect to R. Note that the second equation of system (2.6) is the
very deﬁnition of R for metric (2.5) and we have assumed f (cid:48)(cid:48) and H diﬀerent from zero.

In order to have an inﬂationary phase for large R (larger than a certain scale M 2), we
need ˙H ≈ 0. From the second equation of system (2.6) this implies R ≈ 12H 2 and thus
˙R ≈ 0. This happens if, from the ﬁrst equation of system (2.6), one has:

f (cid:48)
f

≈

2
R

,

or

Rf (cid:48)/2 − f

6Hf (cid:48)(cid:48) ∼ 0 .

The ﬁrst condition leads us to

f (R) ∼ R2 ,

(2.7)

(2.8)

which is the Starobinsky R2 correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The second condition
tells us that 6Hf (cid:48)(cid:48) must grow more rapidly than Rf (cid:48)/2 − f for large R. This can be achieved
via a Rn correction with n > 2, but then the problem that we have mentioned earlier appears:
the scalar ﬁeld has to climb a potential barrier in order for Inﬂation to end. Recently,
an investigation of the inﬂationary dynamics generated by an inﬂaton ﬁeld climbing up a
potential has been investigated in Refs. [30, 31], where the authors present viable scenarios.
Another recent interesting proposal is Ref. [32] where a logarithmic correction to the Einstein-
Hilbert action is investigated. In this case, the divergence is linear since the R term dominates
but the presence of the logarithmic correction produces a plateau at intermediate energies
where Inﬂation might take place.

The potential (2.3) for the Starobinsky model can be computed exactly and has the

following form:

U (χ) =

(2.9)

This potential presents a plateau for high values of the inﬂation ﬁeld, as shown in Figs. 1.

2.2 The α-Attractors: E-models

The subclass of α-Attractors called E-Models [20] is described by the following scalar ﬁeld
potential:

behavior of the above potential for diﬀerent choices of α.

– 4 –

Applying the deﬁnitions given in Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) to the E-Models potential of

Eq. (2.10), it is not diﬃcult to obtain the following diﬀerential equation for f (R):

where we have deﬁned

Rf (cid:48) − f =

3M 2
2(1 − β)2

(cid:16)

f (cid:48) − f

(cid:48)β(cid:17)2

,

β ≡ 1 −

1
√
α

.

(2.11)

(2.12)

Note that, since α > 0, then β < 1. When α = 1, i.e. β = 0, one can easily check that the
Starobinsky model is solution of Eq. (2.11). When α → ∞, i.e. β → 1, it is easy to see that
from Eq. (2.10) we get a χ2 potential and the corresponding f (R) theory can be found by
solving the equation:

Rf (cid:48) − f =

M 2f (cid:48)2 ln2(f (cid:48)) .

(2.13)

3
2

Finally, note that f = R turns Eq. (2.11) into a identity. Therefore, Eq. (2.11) can be seen
as an equation which determines the correction to the usual Einstein-Hilbert action which is
able to reproduce the inﬂationary dynamics of the α-Attractors E-models.

Unfortunately, Eq. (2.11) cannot be solved analytically for a generic α and we analyse it
numerically in the appendix. On the other hand, if there exists a f (R) theory reconstructing
the same inﬂationary dynamics as the α-Attractors, then at high energies the former must
behave as the Starobinsky model, i.e. f (R) ∝ R2, because the α-Attractors potential displays
a plateau at high energies and, in the framework of f (R) theories, this is realized only by a
f (R) ∝ R2 correction.

Let us show this explicitly, assuming a f (R) = γRn theory, where γ > 0 is an arbitrary

energy scale and n > 1, and substituting it into Eq. (2.11):

2(n − 1)(1 − β)2
3M 2γn2

R2−n =

(cid:104)

1 − (γn)β−1R(β−1)(n−1)(cid:105)2

.

(2.14)

Since β < 1 and n > 1, the exponent (β − 1)(n − 1) is negative. Therefore, in the limit

γRn−1 → ∞, we get from Eq. (2.14):

2(n − 1)(1 − β)2
3M 2γn2

R2−n → 1 .

(2.15)

In order to satisfy this limit, n must be equal to 2. This result conﬁrms that the asymptotic
behavior of a f (R) theory which aims to reproduce the α-Attractors dynamics must go as
R2 for large R. We then propose this ansatz:

f (R) = R + aRn + bR2 ,

(2.16)

where a > 0 and b > 0 are arbitrary energy scales and n > 1. Let’s substitute Eq. (2.16) into
Eq. (2.11):

a(n − 1)Rn + bR2
(1 + anRn−1 + 2bR)2 =

3M 2
2(1 − β)2

(cid:104)

1 − (1 + anRn−1 + 2bR)β−1(cid:105)2

,

(2.17)

and consider the high energy limits:

aRn−1 (cid:29) 1 ,

and bR (cid:29) 1 .

(2.18)

– 5 –

If n < 2, the dominant contributions in Eq. (2.17) are those proportional to R2 and we get
from them:

b =

(1 − β)2
6M 2

.

(2.19)

For β = 0 we then recover the correct form of the coeﬃcient in Eq. (1.1) for the Starobinsky
model. One can check that in Eq. (2.17) the next-to-leading power in n, being n < 2, is
n itself, whereas the next-to-leading power in β, being β < 1, is β + 1. Therefore, we can
approximate Eq. (2.17) as follows:

a(n − 1)Rn + bR2 ∼

3M 2
2(1 − β)2

(cid:104)

4b2R2 + a2n2R2(n−1) + 4banRn − 2(2bR)β+1(cid:105)

. (2.20)

We equate the sub-dominant powers and their respective coeﬃcients, obtaining:

n = β + 1

a = (2b)β .

(2.21)

When β = 0, the aRn contribution of Eq. (2.16) is thus reincorporated into the usual Einstein-
Hilbert term of the action and we are left with the Starobinsky model. The comparison
between powers that we have just done in Eq. (2.17) allows us to reconstruct the α-Attractors
at high energies as a polynomial correction to the Starobinsky model, cf. Eq. (2.16):

f (R) = R +

(cid:21)β

(cid:20) (1 − β)2
3M 2

Rβ+1 +

(1 − β)2
6M 2 R2 .

(2.22)

This is just an approximation because the other sub-leading powers do not compensate, being
indeed Eq. (2.16) not a solution of Eq. (2.11).

If n ≥ 2 in Eq. (2.17), one can easily check that the equation can be balanced only if
n = 2. This is expected because, as we have already commented earlier, in order to provide
a scalar potential with a plateau at high energies, a f (R) theory must go asymptotically as
R2.

2.3 The α-Attractors: T-models

There exists another subclass of the α-Attractors named T-Models. The potential charac-
terising these models is the following:

UT (χ) = 3M 2M 2

Plα tanh2

(cid:18)

√

χ
6αMPl

(cid:19)

,

(2.23)

i.e. based on the plateau-like behavior of the hyperbolic tangent for large values of the ﬁeld.
Indeed, the above potential recovers the E-models potential, and therefore the Starobinsky
one when α = 1, only for large values of the ﬁeld. In Fig. 1 we display the evolution of the
E-models and T-models for some values of α including α = 1, i.e. the Starobinsky model.

In the large α limit, by performing a Taylor-series expansion, it is easy to see that
the T-models potential (2.23) coincides with the one of the chaotic inﬂation model with a
quadratic potential [18], as for the E-models.

As we did in the previous subsection, using the deﬁnitions given in Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3)
for the T-Model potential of Eq. (2.23), we can obtain a diﬀerential equation which allows
to reconstruct a corresponding f (R):

f (cid:48)2

(cid:2)1 − f (cid:48)(β−1)(cid:3)2
(cid:2)1 + f (cid:48)(β−1)(cid:3)2 =

(1 − β)2
6M 2

(Rf (cid:48) − f ) .

because they reproduce the Starobinsky model and the chaotic inﬂation model [33, 34].

In the limit of large ﬁelds, i.e. f (cid:48)β−1 → 0,2 the above equation becomes similar to Eq. (2.11).
Therefore, the same asymptotic analysis which led us to justify the ansatz given in Eq. (2.22)
applies.

3 A power law extension of the Starobinsky model

Motivated by the result of the previous section, here we address in detail the model given
by Eq. (2.22), i.e. a power law extension of the Starobinsky model. In this case it is not
possible to ﬁnd a closed, analytic form for the potential of Eq. (2.3) as function of the ﬁeld
χ of Eq. (2.2). In Refs. [35, 36] the authors show that the following potential (written here
in our notation):

This expression suggests the use of the dimensionless variable R/3M 2. Indeed, one can easily
show that also the potential (2.3) is a function of R/3M 2, since:

sponding to Eq. (2.22).

For single ﬁeld inﬂationary models, the above runnings are of the order of αs ∼ 10−3 and βs ∼
10−5
[37, 38]. Discriminating among αs and βs of diﬀerent models is still an experimental
challenge, however it might be possible to use αs to this purpose in forthcoming Stage-4 CMB
experiments, see e.g. Ref. [39]. In Fig. 2 we display the evolution of ns and r as functions of
β, showing a good agreement with the observational constraints for a range 0 < β (cid:46) 0.8. The
latter value corresponds to a R1.8 correction to the Starobinsky model. In Fig. 2 we also plot
the runnings as functions of β and, ﬁnally, in Fig. 3 we display the prediction of the model
investigated in this section on the r vs ns plane by varying β in the interval −0.02 < β < 0.8
(corresponding to 0.96 < α < 25) and comparing this evolution with the contour regions
allowed from the Planck data [6]. As one can appreciate, the polynomial correction to R2
allows larger values of r. In particular, it seems that diminishing the number of e-folds could
allow to even larger values of r.

4 Study of the single power law f (R) inﬂationary model

In this section we address, for completeness, the case of a single power-law f (R):

f (R) = R +

R2−δ
(6M 2)1−δ ,

(4.1)

and compute its predictions on the inﬂationary parameters. This kind of model has already
been investigated in Ref. [22], in order to test the robustness of the Starobinsky model and
assess how much precise data have to be in order to detect deviations from the case δ = 0.
We present a similar analysis in next section, providing analytic results for the inﬂationary
parameters ns and r as functions of the number of e-folds N and the new parameter δ.

Starting from Eq. (4.1), we can determine the following potential for the scalar ﬁeld χ:

It is straightforward to see that for δ = 0 we recover the Starobinsky model given in Eq. (2.9).
For large ﬁelds, the above potential behaves as:

where again, for δ = 0, we recover the plateau typical of the Starobinsky model. In Fig. 4
we show the behaviour of U (χ) of the model (4.2) for diﬀerent values of δ and of (2.10) for
diﬀerent values of α, compared with the Starobinsky model.

Figure 4. Upper panel. Evolution of the potential (2.10) for α = 1.1 (dashed line) and α = 1.2 (dotted
line) compared with the Starobinsky case (solid line). Lower panel. Evolution of the potential (4.2)
for δ = 0.05 (upper dashed line) and δ = −0.05 (lower dotted line) compared with the Starobinsky
case (solid line).

As expected, from Fig. 4 one can see that the α-Attractors potential seems to preserve
the plateau at high energies, whereas the δ-model displays an important change in the steep-
ness of the potential. This statement can be made more quantitative by calculating the slow
roll parameters from Eq. (4.2). One has for (cid:15)U :

i.e. there is no plateau if δ > 0, as we expected from observing Fig. 4 and from the analysis
performed earlier in Sec. 2. Moreover, since (cid:15)U (cid:28) 1 in order to have an inﬂationary phase,
then δ (cid:28) 1.

The value of the ﬁeld at which inﬂation ends is given by (cid:15)U (χf ) ≈ 1, which in our case

As we can see, diﬀerently from the α-Attractors case, the δ correction interferes also with the
scalar spectral index, through the combination N δ. In Fig. 5 we display the numerical results
for the evolution of ns and r as functions of δ, by ﬁxing the number of e-folds N = 55 and
N = 60. For completeness, in the same ﬁgure we also calculate the nonvanishing runnings
αs = dns/d log k and βs = dαs/d log k.

In Fig. 6 we display the δ model in the r vs ns plane, again choosing N = 55 and
N = 60. When N = 55, the variation of the δ parameter is −0.004 < δ < 0.011 for 1σ,
and −0.011 < δ < 0.022 for 2σ. When N = 60, it is −0.008 < δ < 0.006 for 1σ, and
−0.015 < δ < 0.016 for 2σ. This ﬁgure is very similar to the ﬁrst panel of Fig. 4 of Ref. [22].
Diﬀerently from the α-Attractors case, the δ model move in the “wrong” direction in

the r vs ns, i.e. they move mostly horizontally.

5 Discussion and conclusions

Motivated by the good agreement between the cosmological parameters ns and r provided
by the α-Attractors theory and recent observations, we derive a diﬀerential equation for a
f (R) theory from the scalar potentials of α-Attractors, cf. Eq. (2.11), in order to ﬁnd a
f (R) theory compatible with this class of models. Since this diﬀerential equation cannot
be solved analytically for any choice α, we make an asymptotic analysis at high energies,
where Inﬂation is expected to take place, and show that the ansatz (2.22) represents a viable
solution to the diﬀerential equation (2.11) at the leading and sub-leading order in the limit
R → ∞.

Then, we investigate the predictions on the inﬂationary parameters provided by the
power law extension of the Starobinsky model and show that they are in very good agreement
with observation, allowing for a greater production of gravitational waves, i.e. a larger r,
than in the Starobinsky model.

– 12 –

We also made a detailed analysis of the model f (R) = γR2−δ and found a mostly
horizontal movement of the predictions of the model in the r–ns plane, indicating that the
missing of the R2 term in the action alters drastically the behaviour of the inﬂationary
evolution.

The reconstruction here performed of the α-Attractors models is conﬁned to a f (R)
model. A future investigation in this sense could start from a more general extension of GR,
such as the Horndeski theory [40].

A Detailed investigation of the diﬀerential equation (2.11)

In this appendix we investigate in greater detail Eq. (2.11), which we report here:

Rf (cid:48) − f =

3M 2
2(1 − β)2

(cid:16)

f (cid:48) − f

(cid:48)β(cid:17)2

.

(A.1)

First of all, we deﬁne f (R) ≡ R +F (R), i.e. we postulate the presence of the Einstein-Hilbert
term and focus our attention just on its correction. Equation (A.1) thus becomes:

RF (cid:48) − F =

3M 2

2(1 − β)2 (1 + F (cid:48))2 (cid:104)

1 − (1 + F (cid:48))β−1(cid:105)2

.

(A.2)

Next, we normalise R and F to 3M 2/2 and deﬁne γ ≡ β − 1 = −1/

√

α < 0, thus obtaining:3

RF (cid:48) − F =

(1 + F (cid:48))2
γ2

(cid:2)1 − (1 + F (cid:48))γ(cid:3)2 .

(A.3)

Deriving this equation with respect to R, it is not diﬃcult to obtain:

2 (F (cid:48) + 1) [(F (cid:48) + 1)γ − 1] [(γ + 1) (F (cid:48) + 1)γ − 1]
γ2

F (cid:48)(cid:48) = RF (cid:48)(cid:48) .

(A.4)

Now, this equation is satisﬁed if F (cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 but then it would give a linear solution for F (R)
in which we are not interested since we have already stipulated that f (R) ≡ R + F (R).
Therefore, we assume that F (cid:48)(cid:48) > 0, and the above equation gives us:

R =

2 (F (cid:48) + 1) [(F (cid:48) + 1)γ − 1] [(γ + 1) (F (cid:48) + 1)γ − 1]
γ2

.

For γ = −1, one can easily recover the Starobinsky case, since:

R = 2F (cid:48) ⇒ F =

R2

numerical-solution-to-a-nonlinear-ordinary-differential-equation, obtaining very useful help.

– 13 –

and restoring the normalisation by 3M 2/2 one obtains Eq. (1.1).

Equation (A.5) gives us a constraint on the expression of F (cid:48)(R) which we must take
into account when solving (A.3) in order to select the correct initial condition and exclude
the linear solution. Note that F (cid:48) = 0 implies from Eq. (A.5) that R = 0 and then, from
Eq. (A.3), that F = 0. We have thus that F (0) = F (cid:48)(0) = 0, as desired.

The strategy in order to numerically obtain a solution F (R) is the following. We choose
an initial, small but non vanishing Ri ≡ (cid:15); determine F (cid:48)((cid:15)) from Eq. (A.5); determine the
initial condition F ((cid:15)) from Eq. (A.3); solve either Eq. (A.3) or Eq. (A.5). A simpler way is
to use the fact that F (cid:48)(R) → 0 for R → 0. Then, for a suﬃciently small (cid:15), keeping the lowest
order in F (cid:48)((cid:15)) in Eqs. (A.5) and (A.3), we get:

(cid:15) ∼ 2F (cid:48)((cid:15)) ,

F ((cid:15)) =

(cid:15)2
4

,

(A.7)

which is indeed the Starobinsky case found in Eq. (A.6), revealing thereby that the Starobin-
sky model is a low curvature approximation of the α-Attractors. This can be also seen by
taking the low χ limit of Eq. (2.10). We can also prove that the Starobinsky model is a high
curvature approximation of the α-Attractors, since F (cid:48)(cid:48) > 0 and γ < 0. Then, for R → ∞ we
get from Eq. (A.5):

R ∼

2F (cid:48)
γ2 ,

for R → ∞ , ⇒ F ∼

γ2
4

R2 ,

for R → ∞ .

(A.8)

Being γ = β − 1, restoring the 3M 2/2 normalisation, one easily recover our approximation
(2.22). Indeed, the plots in the upper panel of Fig. 7 suggest that the Starobinsky model
is also a high curvature approximation of the α-Attractors (of course, with diﬀerent energy
scales depending on the parameter α). This fact is somehow expected, since both the theories
are characterised by a plateau potential at high energies.

In Fig. 8 we also display the goodness of our approximation (2.22) in the case α = 4.
