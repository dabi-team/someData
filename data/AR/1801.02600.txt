We revisit the question of how to calculate correlations of the curvature perturbation, ζ, using
the δN formalism when one cannot employ a truncated Taylor expansion of N . This problem
arises when one uses lattice simulations to probe the eﬀects of isocurvature modes on models of
reheating. Working in real space, we use an expansion in the cross-correlation between ﬁelds at
diﬀerent positions, and present simple expressions for observables such as the power spectrum and
the reduced bispectrum, fNL. These take the same form as those of the usual δN expressions,
but with the derivatives of N replaced by non-perturbative δN coeﬃcients. We test the validity
of this expansion and, when compared to others in the literature, argue that our expressions are
particularly well suited for use with simulations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Inﬂation has been extremely successful in explaining
the generation of the primordial perturbations seeding
the structures of our universe, but the microphysics of in-
ﬂation remains unknown. The simplest model consistent
with existing observational data is to assume that inﬂa-
ton ﬂuctuations are solely responsible for the observed
curvature perturbations. Although such a scenario is the
simplest, it is quite possible that more complicated sce-
narios involving additional ﬁelds, as exempliﬁed by the
curvaton model [1, 2] and the modulated reheating model
[3, 4], are actually realized. To test diﬀerent inﬂation-
ary theories against observations, one must calculate the
precise form of the correlation functions of the primor-
dial curvature perturbation, ζ. One technique used to
do this is the separate universe approximation combined
with the δN formalism [5–9] . In this approach, ζ is given
by the perturbation in the local e-folding number

ζ(x) = δN (x) = N ((cid:126)χ(x)) − ¯N ,

(1)

where N is the number of e-folds between an initial ﬂat
hypersurface at some early time (such as horizon cross-
ing) and a ﬁnal uniform density hypersurface at some
later time (such as the end of inﬂation or after reheat-
ing), and ¯N = (cid:104)N (cid:105). Throughout, angle brackets indicate
an ensemble average. We consider n ﬁelds labeled, χI ,
where I runs from 1 to n, and for convenience we intro-
duce the vector, (cid:126)χ, where each element represents one of
the n ﬁelds.

N is calculated by assuming that locally the universe
can be approximated as a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
spacetime, and hence is a function of the local ﬁeld values

on the initial ﬂat hypersurface. Standard practice is to
approximate δN by making a Taylor expansion in the ini-
tial ﬁeld values and keeping only a small number of terms.
In some cases, however, N depends very sensitively on
the initial ﬁeld values, and a truncated Taylor expansion
is not a good approximation. Such cases include those in
which a light ﬁeld in addition to the inﬂaton inﬂuences
the dynamics of non-perturbative reheating [10–13]. In
this paper we return to the issue of how to deal with
such cases. As we will see, an alternative expansion is
sometimes possible.

Although the primary motivation for our work is the
interpretation of the results of lattice simulations, here
we study the question generally. Our approach employs
many of the key ideas contained in the work of Suyama
and Yokoyama [14], and our results are broadly equiv-
alent to theirs. In that work, however, a key step was
to make a Fourier transform of the N function (treated
as a function of a single ﬁeld value). This is useful for
analytic manipulations, but leads to expressions for the
correlation functions that are less useful if an exact form
for N is unknown, or, as can be the case for lattice sim-
ulations, it is not eﬃcient even to calculate the form of
the N function explicitly. The expressions we arrive at
are more applicable in this setting, lending themselves to
a Monte Carlo approach, a point we return to later. Our
methods are more closely related to the work of Bethke,
Figueroa and Rajantie [15, 16] who considered the power
spectrum of gravitational waves from massless preheat-
ing, though depart from both these earlier studies by
considering n ﬁelds whose initial probability distribution
need not be precisely Gaussian. We perform explicit cal-
culations only for the two and three-point functions of
ζ, but the method extends trivially to higher point func-
tions. For other related work with a diﬀerent approach
to ours, see [17] and [18] where the authors develop and
apply a non-perturbative formulation of δN by incorpo-
rating the stochastic corrections to N .

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In

 
 
 
 
 
 
section II, we develop and describe the non-perturbative
δN formalism. Our main results are presented in sec-
tion II C 3. We then apply this formalism in section III
to both analytic and non-analytic examples and make
useful comparisons to regular δN formalism. Finally, we
conclude in section IV.

and when we discuss correlations of ζ we always mean
those at the ﬁnal time. Finally we also note that taking
α(k1, k2, k3) to be zero (along with higher order cumu-
lants) is a good approximation for canonical theories with
the ﬁeld statistics evaluated at horizon crossing, but not
otherwise.

δN without a Taylor expansion

A. Regular δN

1. Preliminaries and notation

In the standard δN approach, to calculate the correla-
tions of ζ in Fourier space one ﬁrst assumes that the sta-
tistical distribution of ﬁeld space perturbations is known
on the initial ﬂat hypersurface. The ﬁeld perturbations,
δχI = χI − ¯χI , are taken to be close to Gaussian with
the power spectrum deﬁned as

(cid:104)δχI
k1

δχJ
k2

(cid:105) = (2π)3ΣIJ (k)δ3(k1 + k2) .

(2)

Higher order cumulants are either taken to be completely
negligible, or are included in the formalism, order by or-
der, considering ﬁrst the three-point function on the ini-
tial hypersurface,

δχK
k3

δχJ
k2

(cid:104)δχI
k1

(cid:105) = (2π)3αIJK(k1, k2, k3)δ3(k1 + k2 + k3) ,
(3)
and then successive higher order cumulants. To utilise
Eq. (1), one ﬁrst makes a Taylor expansion of the N
function in terms of δχI (x), such that to second order

δN (x) = N,I δχI(x) +

(cid:16)

N,IJ

δχI(x)δχJ(x)−δχI δχJ

(cid:17)

,

(4)
where δχI δχJ = (cid:104)δχI (x)δχJ (x)(cid:105). One then considers the
Fourier transform of Eq. (4), and forms the desired corre-
lation of ζ(k), typically keeping only the leading terms.
Finally, applying a Wick expansion, and using Eq. (2)
and any non-zero higher order cumulants, one produces
an expression for the Fourier space correlations of ζ at
the ﬁnal time in terms of the correlations of the ﬁelds
at the early time. For example, the two and three-point
functions of ζ, deﬁned in terms of the power spectrum
Pζ and bispectrum Bζ are given by

(cid:104)ζk1ζk2 (cid:105) ≡ (2π)3Pζ(k1)δ3(k1 + k2)

= (2π)3N,I N,J ΣIJ (k1)δ3(k1 + k2)

(5)

(cid:104)ζk1 ζk2ζk3 (cid:105) ≡ (2π)3Bζ(k1, k2, k3)δ3(k1 + k2 + k3)

= (2π)3(cid:104)

N,I N,J N,KαIJK(k1, k2, k3)
+ (cid:0)N,I N,J N,KLΣIK(k1)ΣJL(k2)
+ cyclic(cid:1)(cid:105)

δ3(k1 + k2 + k3) .

We will now consider how to proceed if N is not well
approximated by a Taylor expansion.
In this case, it
proves convenient to stay in real space and calculate the
correlations of ζ there, including information from all
scales, and only then to Fourier transform the correlation
(for each of the spatial coordinates which appear) to cal-
culate the Fourier space correlations over observational
scales or equivalently to coarse-grain the correlations over
these scales. This procedure is most convenient because
N is a function of the ﬁelds which are in turn a function
of spatial position. One could attempt to treat N ((cid:126)χ(x))
as a function of x and Fourier transform it directly, but
given that it is a non-linear function of the ﬁelds, the
result would not be a simple function of the Fourier coef-
ﬁcients of the ﬁelds, (cid:126)χ(k), which are the objects we have
information about.

For later convenience, therefore, let us introduce some
notation for the statistics of the ﬁeld space perturbations
in real space as

(cid:104)δχI (x1)δχJ (x2)(cid:105) = ΣIJ (r12) ,

(7)

where r12 = |x1 − x2|, and

(cid:104)δχI (x1)δχJ (x2)δχK(x3)(cid:105) = αIJK(r12, r23, r31) .

(8)

In an abuse of notation we use the same symbol for the
correlations as for the related objects in Fourier space
(deﬁned in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3)), but it will always be
clear from the context which we mean. We further deﬁne
the shorthand notation

(cid:104)δχI (x1)δχJ (x1)(cid:105) = ΣIJ

(9)

(cid:104)δχI (x1)δχJ (x1)δχK(x1)(cid:105) = αIJK ,
since when evaluated at the same spatial position the
correlations are no longer functions of space.

(10)

Finally, we introduce more short hand notation such
that the evaluation of a function at a given spatial posi-
tion is denoted using a subscript, for example ζ1 = ζ(x1),
1 = χI (x1) and N1 = N ((cid:126)χ(x1)). This is helpful to keep
χI
our expressions to a manageable size when we are con-
sidering many spatial positions in one expression.

We note that here and throughout when we discuss corre-
lations of ﬁelds we always mean those at the initial time,

When ζ cannot be written in terms of an expansion in
δχI (x), one cannot write the correlations of ζ in terms

(6)

2. A non-perturbative expression

of a ﬁnite number of correlations of the ﬁeld perturba-
tions.
Instead one must fall back on the deﬁnition of
the ensemble average, and write the m-point function,
(cid:104)ζ(x1)...ζ(xm)(cid:105), in terms of the full n × m joint probabil-
ity distribution for the n ﬁelds evaluated at the m spatial
positions. This is given as

(cid:104)ζ1...ζm(cid:105) = (cid:104)(N1 − ¯N )...(Nm − ¯N )(cid:105)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

d(cid:126)χ1 ...

d(cid:126)χm(N1 − ¯N )...(Nm − ¯N )

× P((cid:126)χ1, ..., (cid:126)χm) ,

(11)

where P is the joint probability distribution for the m×n
variables χI
i , and we have used the subscript notation de-
ﬁned at the end of the previous subsection. The integral
is over all the ﬁelds evaluated at the m distinct spatial
positions. If N is a simple function, and if P can be taken
to be Gaussian, which is often a very good approxima-
tion, then it is possible to evaluate Eq. (11) analytically.
More generally it is possible to evaluate it numerically.
We will see examples of both for the single ﬁeld case in
section (III).

Although not presented explicitly there, Eq. (11) in
the single ﬁeld case is the starting point for the work of
Suyama and Yokoyama [14]. In that work the focus is on
extracting analytic results for the moments of ζ when an
analytic form for N is known. They proceed by assuming
that the probability distribution is exactly Gaussian, and
by considering the Fourier transform of the N (χ) func-
tion (when N is treated as function of χ). In this case
general expressions for the correlations of N are known
in terms of the Fourier coeﬃcients of N and the variance
of χ (these are given in Eq. (9) of Ref [14]), and they
proceed to work directly with these expressions in their
paper. In our work we work directly with Eq. (11). This
more direct route still allows Eq. (11) to be evaluated an-
alytically for speciﬁc forms of the N (χ) function, but also
allows us to introduce additional ﬁelds, to expand the dis-
tribution, and to consider non-Gaussian initial conditions
in a straightforward manner.

C. Expansions of the probability distribution

While it is possible to work directly with Eq. (11), it
is rather cumbersome in practice, especially if it needs to
be integrated numerically or if the probability distribu-
tion, P, cannot be taken to be Gaussian. Moreover, if a
numerical evaluation is needed the process becomes par-
ticularly involved when the correlations are converted to
Fourier space, to calculate observable quantities such as
the power spectrum and bispectrum on observable scales.
In this case one must Fourier transform the real space
correlations in each of the m spatial coordinates that ap-
pear, which requires that the integral, Eq. (11), is eval-
uated ﬁrst at a suﬃcient number of points in real space
and then transformed to Fourier space.

1. Two expansions

3

Thankfully, for many applications there is still an ap-
proximate method available even when N cannot be Tay-
lor expanded. Rather than expanding the N function,
the idea is to employ, instead, expansions of the distri-
bution P.

First P is expanded around a Gaussian distribution
employing a Gauss-Hermite expansion. In the inﬂation-
ary context a Gauss-Hermite expansion for the distribu-
tion of ﬁeld perturbations was used by Mulryne et al.
[19], and is justiﬁed since the ﬁeld perturbations pro-
duced by inﬂation are very close to Gaussian [20–27]
(even for levels of non-Gaussianity far in excess of ob-
servational bounds).

[15, 16].

Next this distribution is expanded in the cross corre-
lation between ﬁelds evaluated at diﬀerent spatial po-
sitions, ΣIJ (rij) with i (cid:54)= j, around the distribution
for the ﬁeld perturbations evaluated at the same spa-
tial position, i.e, we assume that ΣIJ (rij) < ΣIJ (recall
ΣIJ ≡ ΣIJ (0)). This expansion has been utilised pre-
viously by Suyama and Yokoyama [14] and by Bethke
et al.
It is at least partially justiﬁed if the
power spectrum for the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations δχI (k1) is close
to scale invariant, since then for two positions, x1 and
x2, separated by a distance close to the size of the ob-
servable universe we ﬁnd that ΣIJ (r12) is roughly two
orders of magnitude smaller than ΣIJ . We will always
be interested either in real space correlations of ζ coarse-
grained on these large observationally relevant scales, or
equivalently in the Fourier space correlations for small
wavenumbers. See, however, § II C 6 for caveats and a
more detailed discussion.

2. An interlude on our expansions

Let us begin in the abstract, before moving to the in-
ﬂationary context, and consider the distribution for a set
of close to Gaussian coupled variables yα denoted by the
vector y. This is given by the Gauss-Hermite expansion,

(cid:32)

P(y)=PG (y)

1+

A−1

α(cid:15) A−1

βη A−1
6

γµ α(cid:15)ηµHαβγ(z)

(cid:33)

+ ...

,(12)

where the subscript G indicates a multivariate Gaussian
distribution with covariance matrix Σαβ ≡ (cid:104)δyαδyβ(cid:105) =
Aα(cid:15)Aβ(cid:15), and where ααβγ ≡ (cid:104)δyαδyβδyγ(cid:105). Where δyα =
yα − ¯yα and z is the vector with elements A−1
αβ δyβ. The
functions in the expansion are products of Hermite poly-
nomials deﬁned by a generalised version of Rodrigues’
formula, such that Hαβγ = −∂n/∂zα∂zβ∂zγ exp(−z2).
We will only need the result that Hαβγ(z) = δyαδyβδyγ
if α (cid:54)= β (cid:54)= γ. A multivariate Gauss-Hermite expansion
around a Gaussian distribution has been employed else-
where in the cosmological literature for various purposes
(see, for example, [19, 28–35]).

Now let us consider the second expansion we will need
to make. We note that if any of the elements of the vari-
ance matrix Σαβ are small in the sense that we can ne-
glect terms involving their square, it is possible to make
a Taylor expansion of the distribution, Eq. (12), in this
element. For our purposes to make use of such an expan-
sion, we will only need the following results

3. Calculating correlations of ζ using the expansions

4

Finally, we can use these expansions in the context at
hand. We assume that the distribution which appears in
Eq. (11) for the m × n independent variables, χI
i , is both
close to Gaussian, so that the Gauss-Hermite expansion
can be employed, and moreover that the n × m variate
Gaussian which appears in this expansion can be further
expanded in the cross-correlations ΣIJ (rij) where rij (cid:54)=
0. Specialising to the two-point function and employing
Eq. (11) with both expansions, one ﬁnds that at leading
order

(cid:90)

d(cid:126)χ1PG ((cid:126)χ1)δχK

1 (N1 − ¯N ) ×

(cid:90)

d(cid:126)χ2PG ((cid:126)χ2)δχM

2 (N2 − ¯N ) (15)

where Σ−1
IJ is the inverse of ΣIJ , which for clarity we re-
call is the covariance matrix of ﬁeld perturbations evalu-
ated at the same point in real space. This leading term
comes from the ﬁrst order term in the cross-correlation
Taylor expansion, which is calculated from Eq. (13).
There is no contribution from the zeroth order term be-
cause one needs at least one δχi to accompany each Ni
function so that the expectation of a given term isn’t zero.
Note that the Gaussian probability distribution which
appears twice on the right hand side of this expression
is the n dimensional distribution for ﬁelds evaluated at
only a single position, and we have retained both the sub-
scripts 1 and 2 only for clarity as to how the expression
arises. We can write Eq. (15) as

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105) ≈ ˜NI ˜NJ ΣIJ (r12),

(16)

where we have deﬁned

(cid:90)

˜NI = Σ−1
IJ

d(cid:126)χ1 PG ((cid:126)χ1)N1δχJ
1 ,

(17)

which is analogous to the ﬁrst derivative of N used in
Eq. (4). The spatial position indicated by the subscript
1 is of course arbitrary.

Following the same procedure for the three-point func-
tion one ﬁnds that we must keep two terms at leading
order, one involves the α term from the Gauss-Hermite
expansion, and the second is second order in the cross-
correlation expansion and arises from the term given in
Eq. (14). These are the ﬁrst terms to contribute since
again we need at least one δχi to accompany each of the
three Ni functions in the three-point function so that the

expectation value of a given term is not zero. One ﬁnds

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2ζ3(cid:105) ≈ ˜NI ˜NJ ˜NKαIJK(r12, r23, r31)

(19)

analogous to the second derivative of N used in Eq. (4).

Using these expressions, and accounting for only the
second term of Eq. (18), the local contribution to the
reduced bispectrum fNL, takes the famous form

6
5

fNL =

˜NI ˜NIJ ˜NJ
( ˜NK ˜NK)2

.

(20)

It is important to note that Eqs. (16) and (18) com-
bined with the deﬁnition of ˜NI and ˜NIJ represent a sig-
niﬁcant simpliﬁcation, since the spatial dependence of the
two-point function of ζ is deﬁned entirely through that
of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. This is an important advantage,
particularly if the correlation of ζ is to be evaluated nu-
merically, since otherwise the numerics would need to be
repeated for many values of r12, while in this case ˜NI
and ˜NIJ need only be evaluated once. This allows us
to pass immediately to Fourier space, and to write the

power spectrum and bispectrum of ζ as

Pζ(k) ≈ ˜NI ˜NJ ΣIJ (k)

(21)

Bζ(k1, k2, k3) ≈ ˜NI ˜NJ ˜NKαIJK(k1, k2, k3)

+ (cid:0) ˜NI ˜NJ ˜NKLΣIK(k1)ΣJL(k2)

+ cyclic (cid:1).

(22)

4. Further simpliﬁcations for typical applications

A further simpliﬁcation occurs if we assume that the
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are uncorrelated such that ΣIJ is di-
agonal. The simplest case is if all ﬁelds have the same
variance, such that

ΣIJ = δIJ Pχ

(23)

which is a good approximation at horizon crossing during
inﬂation. More generally the covariance matrix might be
diagonal but with diﬀerent entries, such that

ΣIJ = δIJ PχI

(24)

where no summation is implied. This would be the case
in a model with one inﬂaton ﬁeld and a set of ﬁelds that
were purely isocurvature modes during inﬂation. In this
case one ﬁnds ˜NI simpliﬁes to

˜NI =

(26)

and ˜NIJ simpliﬁes to

because in this case, the covariance matrix is diagonal,
PG((cid:126)χ1) = (cid:81)
1), where subscript UG now stands
for a univariate Gaussian.

5. A Monte Carlo approach

In the paper, the examples we consider will be of
cases where there is a known N function, either an an-
alytic one, or one that has been calculated numerically.
When we utilise the simpliﬁed expressions given above,
we will therefore use the known N function and integrate
Eqs. (26) and (28), either analytically or using numerical
methods. However, a major motivation of our work is to
allow the future study of cases in which it may not be
desirable to ﬁrst calculate N as a function of the initial

5

ﬁeld values. We defer doing this to future work, but it is
worth laying out a case for the suitability of our expres-
It may be that the N function
sions for this purpose.
is highly featured, such as in the case of massless pre-
heating [10, 11, 13, 36–38], and that ﬁrst calculating the
function accurately may not be the most eﬃcient path
to accurately evaluating ˜NI and ˜NIJ . Instead one might
choose to adopt a Monte Carlo approach, in which val-
ues of the initial ﬁeld(s) χI are drawn from a Gaussian
distribution, and for each draw N is evaluated numeri-
cally. ˜NI , for example, is then calculated by evaluating
δχI N for each draw, and the values summed and divided
by the number of draws. The convergence of the result
can be monitored. This was the approach adopted in the
gravitational wave case by Bethke et al.
In
contrast to previous work [14], our expressions are ideal
for this purpose.

[15, 16].

6. Limitations

Subsections II C 3 and II C 4 represent the main results
of our paper. In section III we will see them in practice,
and test their validity. First, however, let us consider
what we expect to be their limitations in terms of the
approximations we have employed.

The ﬁrst limitation stems from the fact that we expand
the probability distribution in the cross correlations be-
tween distinct spatial positions, and then integrate to
calculate the correlations of ζ. This means that the re-
sulting expansion is not guaranteed to be a good one (in
the sense that it will converge), even if the expansion
of the probability distribution does converge. So while
Σ(rij) (cid:28) Σ is suﬃcient for the probability expansion to
be valid, this is not suﬃcient for the correlations calcu-
lated from it to converge. This eﬀectively means that we
have to test the validity of our expressions on a case by
case basis.

The second related issue comes from the fact that even
if the series does converge, there is no guarantee that the
leading term in the cross correlations is suﬃcient. An
extreme example follows from the fact that it is possible
for the “leading” term we quote above to be zero. For
the two-point function this occurs when the N function
is symmetric in one of ﬁelds (about ¯χ) – an even function
in the single ﬁeld case. In this case, considering Eq. (26)
for a single ﬁeld, we see that (cid:104)δχN (χ)(cid:105)G = 0. Although
realistic functions of N will never be fully even or fully
odd, this issue should be borne in mind.

In both cases one thing that can be done is to check
that the sub-leading term is subdominant to the leading
term. Although not proof of convergence this is a simple
way to check that the method is working as intended.
For example, in the single ﬁeld case where the sourcing
scalar ﬁeld is Gaussian, the leading and subleading terms

can be written explicitly as

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105) =

+

(cid:104)δχN (χ)(cid:105)2

(cid:104)δχ2(cid:105)2 Σ(r12)
(cid:104)δχ2(N (χ) − ¯N )(cid:105)2
2(cid:104)δχ2(cid:105)4

Σ(r12)2 + ...

(29)

where ¯N = (cid:104)N (cid:105) and one can compare the magnitude of
the two terms for a given model.

An alternative approach would be to evaluate the full
expression, Eq. (11) (specialising, for example, to the
two-point function) which always remains valid, and com-
pare with the results of the expansion method. To do so
for a full range of r12 would of course negate the advan-
tage of using the expansion in the ﬁrst place, but one
could do so for a single representative value of r12. In
the next section when we study simple examples numer-
ically we will evaluate the full expression over a range of
r12, but we note that in more complex cases this may not
be feasible.

III. EXAMPLES

Let us now see our expressions in practice.

In this
paper we restrict ourselves to cases in which we already
have an N ((cid:126)χ) function calculated, deferring the Monte
Carlo type applications discussed in section II C 5 to fu-
ture work.

In addition to a speciﬁc N function, for concrete ap-
plications, we must also specify the statistics of the ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations δχI (x).
In order to do so, at this point
we specialise to uncoupled Gaussian perturbations, with
scale invariant power spectrum, such that

ΣIJ (k) = δIJ P0
k3 ,

(30)

where P0 is a constant. Moreover, in the examples we
present we will mainly assume that only the perturba-
tions from one ﬁeld contribute signiﬁcantly to ζ, and
therefore we can further specialise to N being a function
of just a single ﬁeld.

With our convention for the Fourier Transform

δχ(x) =

(cid:90)

1
(2π)3

d3keik.xδχk ,

(31)

it follows that

(cid:90)

(cid:90) qmax

(2π)3

d3kPχ(k) =

Σ = (cid:104)δχ2(x)(cid:105) =

(32)
where ∼ L−1 is an IR and qmax a UV cutoﬀ. In this case,
the IR cutoﬀ is just the size of the observable universe,
in other words, the scale over which ¯χ is deﬁned.
This gives

P0
2π2

L−1

,

for the two-point function of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations evaluated
at the same spatial position. Physically, the IR cutoﬀ
must be close to the size of the observable universe so
that the average of δχ(x) within the observable universe
is zero – to be consistent with our initial deﬁnition of
δχ(x) = χ(x) − ¯χ.

Next, consider the correlation of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

at two separated positions. In this case one ﬁnds

(cid:104)δχ(x1)δχ(x2)(cid:105) =

(35)

It is in this cross correlation that the expansion of sec-
tion II C 2 was made. We also deﬁne the cross-correlation
normalised to the variance as

(cid:104)δχ(x1)δχ(x2)(cid:105)

(36)

which we require to be small for the expansion of the
probability distribution to be valid.

For a purely scale invariant spectrum and for distances
max), the

much longer than the UV cutoﬀ (i.e., r12 (cid:29) q−1

N∗
[16], where N∗ ≈ 60 is the number of e-folds before the
end of inﬂation that perturbations corresponding to the
largest observable scales left the horizon. For observable
scales, therefore, ξ(r12) ≈ 1
60 = 0.017. This ratio is not
suﬃciently small that we can have complete conﬁdence in
the expansion method, especially recalling also the limi-
tations mentioned in section II C 6. We expect, however,
that it will likely be suﬃciently accurate in many cases.

A. Analytic examples

The next step is to specify the N (χ) function. To
begin with, for simplicity and in order to highlight some
issues, we follow Ref. [14] and choose the simple analytic
functions studied there.

1. Sine function

First we consider a sine function
N (χ) = B sin (cid:0) χ
λ

(cid:1)

(37)

(cid:104)δχ2(x)(cid:105) =

P0
2π2 ln(qmaxL) ,

(33)

We compute the two-point function of the curvature per-
turbation, (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105), for this example in several ways.

First, we directly integrate the fully non-perturbative
expression for (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105) which arises from Eq. (11); this
makes use of the joint probability distribution for χ1 and
χ2. Because of the simple form of the analytical func-
tion we have taken for N , the resulting integration is
easily tractable analytically, and we denote the result by
(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full.

In section II C 3, we presented Eq. (16) as the result of
our expansion method, and later presented a simpliﬁed
expression for ˜NI in Eq. (26). The second way in which
we compute (an approximation to) (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105) is therefore to
employ these formulae, leading to

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Exp = (cid:104)δχN (cid:105)2 Σ(r12)
(cid:104)δχ2(cid:105)2 .

Taking ¯χ = 0 one ﬁnds

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full = B2e− (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)

λ2 sinh

(cid:32)

(39)

and to leading order

ﬁeld perturbations, Σ, using Σ = σ2, and doing so we
ﬁnd

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full = A2

and to leading and subleading order, from Eq. (29), we

(43)

which also follows from expanding Eq. (42).

The ratio of the subleading term to the leading term

(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Exp = B2e− (cid:104)χ2(cid:105)

(cid:104)χ2(cid:105)

which also follows from expanding Eq. (39).

is

.

This example is useful, because it highlights, as was
also noted in Ref. [14], the possible limitation of our ex-
pansion methods discussed in section II C 6. In this case,
for (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Exp to be a good approximation to (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full, it
is insuﬃcient for only ξ(r12) (cid:28) 1. We have to impose a
more stringent condition, namely ξ(r12)(cid:104)χ2(cid:105) = Σ(r12) (cid:28)
λ2. One should note that this is still a signiﬁcant im-
provement over the standard δN method of making a
Taylor expansion of the N function reviewed in section
II A. λ is a measure of the width of a feature in the N
function, and the requirement for standard δN to work is
that Σ (cid:28) λ2, while for our expansion method only that
Σ(r12) (cid:28) λ2 is required, which as we have seen is two
orders of magnitude less stringent.

2. Gaussian function

For our second analytic example, we consider the N (χ)

function to be an un-normalised Gaussian

N (χ) = A

e

√

−(χ−m1)2
2σ2
1

2πσ1

(41)

where A, m1 and σ1 are constants deﬁning the ampli-
tude, position of the peak and width of the function. In
Ref. [14] the authors used a sum of normal distributions
with diﬀerent amplitudes and widths to represent the
spiky N (χ) function that arises in massless preheating
[10, 11, 13].

Without loss of generality we can take ¯χ = 0. Here we
denote the variance of the probability distribution of the

1σ4/(−m2

We wish to understand when this is small, and hence
when our expansion method can be trusted. Assum-
ing σ1 ≤ σ (the N function is of a similar width or
narrower than the distribution of ﬁeld perturbations),
the condition required for the ratio to be small becomes
Σ(r12) (cid:28) m2
1 + σ2)2. For ﬁxed σ, there is then
both a lower and an upper limit on m1 in order for this
condition to be satisﬁed. This makes sense since if m1
is too small, which in this case means m1 (cid:28) σ the N
function becomes close to even. While if m1 (cid:29) σ the N
function is sampled only by the tail of the probability dis-
tribution, and one would not expect the expansion to be
be accurate. A representative case is m1 ∼ O(σ), lead-
ing to Σ(r12) (cid:28) σ2, which is the condition we assumed
to make our original expansion.

1σ4

The other case is where σ1 ≥ σ. In this case the dis-
tribution is now narrower than the N function, and the
1)2.
ratio implies we must have Σ(r12) (cid:28) m2
In this case the ratio can also be satisﬁed as long as m1
is not too small or too large, which in this case means
neither m1 (cid:28) σ nor m1 (cid:29) σ. In the representative case
of m1 ∼ O(σ1), the condition reduces to Σ(r12) (cid:28) σ2
1,
which is weak given that σ1 > σ. We would expect stan-
dard δN to work in the case (σ (cid:28) σ1), but here, as for
the sinusoidal case, we have relaxed that criteria.

1/(−m2

1 +σ2

3. Lessons

It is also important to note that in all the cases above,
the expansion fails because the leading contribution to

the two-point function of ζ itself becomes very small. In
the second example, if the N function was made up of a
series of spikes (as is the case where the result of massless
pre-heating is parametrised), even if the expansion failed
for some members of the series, the overall value for the
leading term would be dominated by members of the se-
ries for which m1 does not fall outside the allowed range,
leading to an accurate overall result. This also gives us
hope that for a realistic N function, calculated, for ex-
ample, from lattice simulations the expansion method we
advocate will be accurate.

It seems therefore that there are two regimes in which
the method has a good chance of working. One either
requires that Σ(r12)1/2 is smaller than the scale on which
the N function is structured, or that Σ1/2, is much larger
than the scale on which the N function is structured (and
so the structure is averaged over, assuming the average
is not close to zero). In intermediate cases the method
seems to fail. Overall, however, the message of these two
analytic examples is that it is crucial to check for the
validity of the approximation on a case by case basis.

B. A Non-analytic example

Next we turn to a more realistic example. Although
almost all the analysis of the curvaton scenario is based
on the assumption of a perturbative curvaton decay, it
is possible for the curvaton to decay through a non-
perturbative process analogous to inﬂationary preheating
[39, 40]. For our example, we consider the N (χ) function
presented in Fig. 3 of Ref. [12], which was generated from
a resonant curvaton decay scenario using classical lattice
ﬁeld theory simulations [37, 41]. The system consists of
three ﬁelds: an inﬂaton, curvaton and a third light ﬁeld,
χ. The curvaton ﬁeld decays into particles of χ via para-
metric resonance [42–44]. The authors considered only
the contribution of perturbations from the χ ﬁeld to ζ,
and so N is a function only of this ﬁeld. In order to per-
form the integrations necessary to study this model, we
construct an interpolating function to approximate N (χ)
given the data points presented in Ref. [12]. We present
the data points and the interpolating function in Fig. 1.
In this section we will again compute the two-point
function of the curvature perturbation in real space,
(cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full, from Eq. (11) as described above, and then
using our expansion method (retaining only the leading
term) we will calculate (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Exp. This time both must be
computed numerically, and this means we have to ﬁx the
various parameters which enter the expression presented
at the start of section III, in particular, the IR cutoﬀ
L−1 and the UV cutoﬀ qmax. We do so by assuming that
perturbations which exited the horizon 60 e-folds before
the end of inﬂation correspond to the largest observable
scales today. We associate the largest observable scale
today with L, and include in the calculation all shorter
modes which exit the horizon until the end of inﬂation.
Taking the scale of the shortest modes to be rmin, it then

the interpolating function and the solid red line represents a
quadratic ﬁt to the data points. We will use the interpolating
function for our regular δN analysis.

.

deﬁned as qmax = 2π
rmin

We will also compute the power spectrum in Fourier
space, and the methods we use for this are discussed in
the next subsection. Since the scales constrained by CMB
anisotropy data correspond to the modes which exited
during roughly 4 e-folds of inﬂation, when presenting our
results the range of k values we will interested in range
from 2π
L , i.e., from the horizon size today down
to about e4 times smaller than the horizon size.

L to e4 × 2π

In addition to the full and expanded expressions, we
will also plot the results for the power spectrum that
one attains from the regular δN method, calculating the
derivatives of N locally at our choice of the value of ¯χ. Fi-
nally using our expansion method, we will also calculate
the reduced bispectrum fNL for this model, comparing
with the results which would be obtained from regular
δN .

1. The Power Spectrum

Our expansion method, Eq. (16) allows us to pass di-
rectly to Fourier space and to write the power spectrum
as Pζ(k)Exp ≈ ˜NI ˜NJ ΣIJ (k) where ΣIJ (k) = δIJ P0
k3 .
However,
if one wishes to work with the fully non-
perturbative (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full, one needs to Fourier transform
the real space two-point function of ζ. The route we take
to achieving this is as follows. First we deﬁne

F [ (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full ] = (cid:104)ζk1 ζk2 (cid:105)Full

= (2π)3δ3(k1 + k2)Pζ(k1)Full .

FIG. 2: Case 1: Correlation function of ζ(χ) for one realiza-
tion with ¯χ = 0.001 and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) ≈ 7×10−15 on a Log-Log plot.
The exact correlation function (‘Full’) is calculated from Eq.
(11). The approximated correlation function (‘Expanded’) is
given by Eq. (16). As expected, the approximated correlation
function becomes progressively worse on shorter scales.

FIG. 4: Case 2: Here, we plot the correlation function of ζ(χ)
for one realization with ¯χ = 0.0009998 and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) ≈ 7×10−15
on a Log-Log plot.

FIG. 3: Case 1: Log-Log plots of the power spectrum of ζ,
calculated using the full, expansion and regular δN methods
respectively.

Then given that the two-point function is always some
function of r12 = |r1 − r2|, we deﬁne (cid:104)ζ1ζ2(cid:105)Full = A(r12)
and note

F [A(r12)] =

(cid:90) ∞

FIG. 5: Case 2: Log-Log plots of the power spectrum of ζ,

To evaluate the power spectrum, therefore, one possi-
bility is to ﬁrst use the N (χ) function to calculate A(r12)
for a range of values of r12, and then to perform this one
dimensional integration. Rather than sampling A(r12)
at all positions needed by an integration algorithm, one

ζ(χ) for one realization with ¯χ = 0.001 and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) ≈ 6×10−14.
The approximated correlation function is worse in this case
because the shorter tail distribution ‘sees’ less of the mapping.

could ﬁt A(r12) with an interpolating function. A prob-
lem that arises, however, is that the integral is sensitive
to the value of the integrand even for r12 (cid:29) L. A second
issue is that the integrand is highly oscillatory. These
issues meant we couldn’t get accurate results using this
strategy. An alternative is to evaluate instead Eq. (47),
using a fast (discrete) Fourier transform. Although this
is eﬀectively a three dimensional integral, the speed of
the algorithm involved means it is more tractable than
integrating Eq. (48). To avoid aliasing, we must sam-
ple A(r12) with a small enough uniform intervals such
that the sampling frequency is at least twice the highest
frequency contained in the signal. In this case, the high-
est frequency that we’re interested in is e4 × 2π
L and we
always ensure this criteria is easily met. We must also
ensure that the lowest frequency sampled is at least an
order of magnitude smaller than 2π
L . Even when these
constraints are met, the results of the Fourier transform
will have a number of spurious points. In order to present
a clean plot, therefore, we ﬁt the data in log space to a
polynomial. Finally we plot this ﬁtted function. As a test
that we are sampling the correct range and the method
is working, we ﬁrst applied it to a sampled version of
Eq. (34), to ensure we recovered Eq. (30) with precision.

2. Three cases

We perform our analysis for three cases and present our
analysis of the two-point function and the power spec-
trum in Figs. 2-7. The cases we consider are

1. ¯χ = 0.001 and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) ≈ 7×10−15

2. ¯χ = 0.0009998 and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) ≈ 7×10−15

3. ¯χ = 0.001 and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105) ≈ 6×10−14

For the power spectrum, we plot Pζ(k)/Pζpivot against
k/kpivot. We arbitrarily choose kpivot = 2π
L . We also ﬁx
Pζpivot to be PζFull|k=kpivot for all three (‘Full’, ‘Expanded’,
‘Regular δN’) methods for easy comparison; otherwise all
three lines will lie on top of each other initially as dividing
by each of their corresponding pivot value of Pζ will force
them to start at the same point.

In all cases we see that the expansion method is a
much better approximation to the fully non-perturbative
method than regular δN , and in two of the cases does
a good job at recovering the amplitude and initial scale
In the third case
dependence of the power spectrum.
however, we can see the method is breaking down even
for the largest scales.

In all three cases, we see that the ‘Expanded’ power
spectrum either matches or is smaller that the ‘Full’
power spectrum on all scales while the ‘Regular’ power
spectrum can be smaller or larger than the ‘Full’ answer,
depending on the value of ¯χ and (cid:104)δχ2(cid:105).

FIG. 7: Case 3: Log-Log plots of the power spectrum of ζ,
calculated using the full, expansion and regular δN methods
respectively. The eﬀect of the shorter tail distribution is also
reﬂected in the diﬀerence between the ‘Full’ and ‘Expanded’
power spectra.

3. The Reduced Bispectrum

First, we calculate the reduced bispectrum using reg-
ular δN . For case 1, fNL is O(1010), fNL is negative
and O(107) for case 2 and ﬁnally, fNL is O(1010) for case
3. Using Eq. (20), i.e., using the expansion method we
can also calculate the reduced bispectrum in each case.
We ﬁnd that fNL is enormous for all three cases: fNL
is O(109), O(108) and O(1010) for case 1, 2 and 3 re-
spectively. This is to be expected since in all cases the
higher order terms in the non-perturbative δN expansion
are relatively large (since by eye one can see the full line

deviate from the expanded line plotted using only the
leading term).

However, we also ﬁnd that the amplitude of the curva-
ture perturbation for these speciﬁc examples is too small
to explain the observed amplitude: O(10−20) , O(10−19)
and O(10−20) for case 1, 2 and 3 respectively. It is likely
this can be altered by changing (cid:104)δχδχ(cid:105). But given the
N (χ) function we began with, we are limited to assum-
ing (cid:104)δχδχ(cid:105)1/2 is much smaller than the range of χ over
which the N function has been calculated. Ultimately
(cid:104)δχδχ(cid:105)1/2 is ﬁxed by the energy scale of inﬂation, but un-
like in the usual approach we can’t account for the eﬀect
of changing this energy scale after calculating the deriva-
tives of N , because the non-perturbative nature of the
calculation means the non-perturbation δN coeﬃcients
are aﬀected by (cid:104)δχδχ(cid:105)1/2.

In terms of the parameters we are working with, there-
fore, in order to agree with observation we would require
that the total curvature perturbation is a mixture of the
subdominant component that we have and another dom-
inant component. Taking the observed amplitude to be
10−9 [45] and taking the dominant component to be the
standard adiabatic Gaussian perturbation from the inﬂa-
ton, this mixture dilutes the non-Gaussianity of the to-
tal curvature perturbation and as a result, fNL becomes
O(10−13), O(10−12) and O(10−12) for case 1, 2 and 3
respectively (assuming the inﬂaton contribution is com-
pletely Gaussian) which is far below the observational
sensitivity [46].

IV. CONCLUSION

In the regular δN formalism, the mapping between
the curvature perturbation ζ and the scalar ﬁeld(s) ﬂuc-
tuations is approximated by a Taylor expansion in the
ﬁelds. This standard technique fails in some cases. Ex-
amples include the massless preheating model and the
non-perturbative curvaton decay model we revisited in
the examples section of this work. In this work, we dis-
cuss how to calculate correlation functions of ζ when the
mapping is an arbitrary function of the scalar ﬁeld(s)
without making a Taylor expansion. This entails inte-
grating the full probability distribution of the ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations against copies of the N function relating e-folds
to initial ﬁeld values (‘Non-perturbative δN formalism’).
We discuss how to calculate results using a ‘Full’ (not ap-
proximated) implementation of this formalism, but show
that this can be convoluted in practice. For observation-

11

ally relevant scales the task can be made simpler using
an expansion method. This leads to a set of expressions
for observable quantities in terms of non-perturbative δN
coeﬃcients analogous to the usual δN coeﬃcients (‘Ex-
panded’). We argue that the validity of the expansion
method must be tested on a case by case basis and sug-
gest ways to do this, but show that at least in the realistic
example we consider it leads to a marked improvement
over regular δN , and can approximate well the full result.
Our results are closely related to the work of Suyama
and Yokoyama [14] and Bethke et al.
([15], [16]), but
we diverge from their work in a number of ways. First
we show how to incorporate the perturbations from n
ﬁelds whose initial probability distribution need not be
precisely Gaussian, and we present our expressions in an
alternative way to those authors, which is more suitable
for numerical analysis. The expressions are, as we discuss
in section II C 4, particularly well suited to settings in
which a Monte Carlo approach can be advantageous. We
intend to employ our results in this setting in forthcoming
work, directly utilising lattice simulations.

It might seem odd at ﬁrst that we can use the separate
universe approach and information from lattice simula-
tions, which simulate only very short scales, to infer in-
formation about perturbations on observable scales. This
works, however, because the non-pertubative method
works in real space initially, and at ﬁrst calculates quanti-
ties such as (cid:104)ζ(x)ζ(y)(cid:105) without coarse-graining. As long
as the simulations are of regions larger than the horizon
during reheating, therefore, there is then no barrier to us-
ing this method together with δN to calculate (cid:104)ζ(x)ζ(y)(cid:105).
This is not directly observable, since it includes infor-
mation about all scales which aren’t observable. After
calculating it, however, we can take its Fourier trans-
form and consider the Fourier modes over the range of
observable scales (or equivalently coarse-grain the real
space result on these scales) to compare with observa-
tions. The method we present, therefore, represents a
unique opportunity to extract for the ﬁrst time observ-
able predictions for the curvature perturbation directly
from lattice simulations.
