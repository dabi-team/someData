ABSTRACT

We report a detailed study of the pre-eruption activities that led to the occurrence of an M9.0
ﬂare/CME event on 2012 October 20 in NOAA AR 11598. This includes the study of the preceding
conﬁned C2.4 ﬂare that occurred on the same AR ∼25 minutes earlier. We observed that the M9.0
ﬂare occurred as a consequence of two distinct triggering events well separated in time. The ﬁrst
triggering episode occurred as early as ∼20 minutes before the onset of the M9.0 ﬂare, evidenced by
the destabilization and rise of a pre-existing ﬁlament to a new position of equilibrium at a higher coronal
altitude during the decay phase of the C2.4 ﬂare. This brought the system to a magnetic conﬁguration
where the establishment of the second triggering event was favorable. The second triggering episode
occurred ∼17 minutes later, during the early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare, evidenced by the further rise
of the ﬁlament and successful ejection. The second trigger is followed by a ﬂare precursor phase,
characterized by non-thermal emission and the sequential formation of a hot channel as shown by
the SDO/AIA DEM (diﬀerential emission measure) maps, the RHESSI X-ray images and spectra.
These observations are suggestive of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration that can explain
the precursor phase and can be directly related to the formation of the hot channel. We discuss on
the triggering mechanisms, their implications during the early and precursor phases and highlight the
importance of early activities and preceding small conﬁned ﬂares to understand the initiation of large
eruptive ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are powerful magnetically-driven events
on the Sun that lead to the release of large amounts
of energy in the form of particle acceleration and elec-
tromagnetic radiation (e.g. Fletcher et al. 2011). They
are often associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
and aﬀect space weather conditions (for reviews see
Priest & Forbes 2002; Fletcher et al. 2011; Benz 2017).
Solar ﬂares can be triggered by the destabilization of
ﬁlaments, i.e. dense clouds of relatively cool plasma
(∼8000 K), sustained against gravity by dipped or
twisted (helical) magnetic ﬁelds above the Sun’s surface.
The latter helical structures, that are formed when the

magnetic ﬁeld winds about a central axis, are termed as
(magnetic) ﬂux ropes (e.g., Cheng et al. 2017).

The pre-CME magnetic structure in the solar atmo-
sphere is still an open issue. A ﬂux rope may exist in
the solar atmosphere already prior to the ﬂare/CME
onset, or it may be formed during the eruption (for re-
views see, e.g., Forbes 2000; Chen 2011; Song et al. 2014;
Cheng et al. 2017). Flux rope formation during erup-
tion is expected from the standard model of eruptive
ﬂares (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1996; Hirayama 1974;
Kopp & Pneuman 1976), as poloidal ﬂux is built around
a rising core ﬁeld (either a sheared arcade or ﬂux rope),
due to magnetic reconnection of the embedding arcade
ﬁeld in a thin current sheet below the core ﬁeld. Pre-
existing ﬂux ropes have been suggested to play a key role
in the initiation and evolution of eruptive ﬂares (T¨or¨ok
& Kliem 2005; Cheng et al. 2013a). Cheng et al. (2011)
presented observational evidence of pre-CME ﬂux rope

formation in the low corona, associated with coherent
structures of hot plasma (termed “hot ﬂux ropes”; see
also Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2013b). Nindos et al.
(2015) provided statistical evidence that about half of
all eruptive ﬂares may involve a hot ﬂux rope. These
are observed in hot EUV channels (such as AIA 131 ˚A)
and soft X-rays. For a fraction of such events, conﬁned
(CME-less) ﬂare activity was found capable of produc-
ing and sustaining a coronal ﬂux rope prior to eruptive
ﬂares (e.g., Patsourakos et al. 2013; Joshi et al. 2014;
Cheng et al. 2014; Joshi et al. 2016).

As summarized recently by Green et al. (2018) (see
Table 1 therein), there are several mechanisms that can
trigger a solar eruption, i.e., that are capable of desta-
bilizing a coronal system so that it may no longer re-
main in a stable equilibrium. Such mechanisms include
(1) tether-cutting reconnection (Moore & Roumeliotis
1992; Moore et al. 2001; Aulanier et al. 2010), in which
the destabilization occurs due to reconnection below the
ﬁlament initiated by the photospheric motions; and (2)
magnetic breakout (Antiochos 1998; Karpen et al. 2012),
in which, destabilization occurs due to magnetic recon-
nection high above the ﬁlament, which reduces the ten-
sion of the overlying ﬁelds and, thus, permitting the
ﬁlament ejection. The location of the enhanced coronal
X-ray emission with respect to the ﬁlament channel may
shed light on the triggering mechanism behind the asso-
ciated mass ejection (e.g. Moore & Sterling 2006; Chifor
et al. 2007). Precursor X-ray emission below a rising ﬁl-
ament may be observational evidence for tether-cutting
reconnection (e.g. Moore et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2009;
Chen et al. 2014; Joshi et al. 2017). Enhanced coronal
X-ray emission above the ﬁlament may be indicative for
a magnetic breakout scenario (e.g., Aulanier et al. 2000;
Ji et al. 2003; Joshi et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2016).

Studies of the early stages of a solar ﬂare can not
only provide information of the triggering mechanism
that led to the ﬂare, but also give a more robust under-
standing of the physical processes that occur before the
ejection and contribute to its occurrence. Relating pre-
ﬂare physical processes with the main energy release can
help to achieve a holistic understanding of why and how
solar ﬂares occur. Activity during the early phase of
eruptive solar ﬂares often involves heating (e.g., F´arn´ık
et al. 1996; Veronig et al. 2002; Gou et al. 2017), the
activation and rise of a ﬁlament (e.g. Joshi et al. 2013;
Chen et al. 2014), or ﬂows of hot plasma along coronal
loops during the precursor phase (e.g. Liu et al. 2015;
Hernandez-Perez et al. 2017). Also, plasma heating as
well as electron acceleration may be observed for the pre-
dominantly thermal pre-ﬂare X-ray corona (e.g., Chifor

et al. 2007; Joshi et al. 2011; Kushwaha et al. 2015; Joshi
et al. 2016).

In our paper, we present a study of the physical pro-
cesses that occurred prior to the eruptive M9.0 ﬂare on
2012 October 20 (peak time: 18:14 UT), with the aim of
understanding the physical processes that brought the
ﬂaring magnetic conﬁguration to a state in which an
ejection was favorable. This includes the study of the
early phase of the ﬂare and the conﬁned C2.4 ﬂare that
occurred in the same AR. We provide direct observations
of the activation of a low-lying ﬁlament during the de-
cay phase of the C2.4 ﬂare, as well as of the heating and
elevation of the ﬁlament during the early phase of the
M9.0 ﬂare. The fact that the source region of the ﬂares
was located behind the solar limb, provided an ideal
setting to study the coronal evolution with high sensi-
tivity. We discuss the importance of the developments
in the course and aftermath of the preceding conﬁned
ﬂare that resulted in the establishment of a hot channel,
the eruptive M9.0 ﬂare and the release of a CME.

2. DATA AND METHODS

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), observes the ultraviolet (UV)
and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission of the solar at-
mosphere, with a spatial resolution of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)2. We studied
the chromosphere, transition region and the quiet corona
using AIA 304 and 171 ˚A ﬁltergrams (sensing plasma at
about 50000 K and 0.6 MK respectively). Coronal and
hot ﬂare plasma is studied using AIA 193 ˚A (sensing
plasma at about 1 MK and 20 MK) and 131 ˚A (sensing
plasma at about 0.4 and 10 MK). All images were co-
registered and co-aligned using standard IDL SolarSoft
procedures.

AIA images were processed by the noise adaptive
fuzzy equalization method (NAFE; Druckm¨uller 2013)
to enhance visibility of ﬁne structures and their changes.
In this method, two free parameters, γ and w, are used
to control the brightness and level of enhancement of
the ﬁnal (processed) image, respectively. For a de-
tailed mathematical explanation of these parameters see
Druckm¨uller (2013). For all EUV channels, we chose
γ = 2.6 and w = 0.25. For the UV channels, γ = 2.2
and w = 0.2. The unprocessed ﬁltergrams acquired in
the individual AIA channels have diﬀerent dynamical
ranges. Thus, the scaling parameters which determines
the minimum and maximum intensity values of input
and output images were set diﬀerently for all AIA chan-
nels. However, they were kept constant for the whole
data set at each particular wavelength.

This event was also observed at 195 ˚A by the Ex-
treme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004)
on the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric
Investigation (SECCHI; Howard et al. 2008) instrument
suite, onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observa-
tory (STEREO; Kaiser et al. 2008). The event occurred
on the western limb from Earth view, i.e. was visible
on-disk for STEREO-B (ST-B).

X-ray imaging and spectroscopy studies were per-
formed with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectro-
scopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002). RHESSI ob-
serves X-rays and gamma-rays at energies ranging from
3 keV to 17 MeV with a time cadence of 4 seconds. It
has a spatial resolution as high as 2(cid:48)(cid:48) and a spectral
resolution of ∼1 keV. For the reconstruction of X-ray
images in this study, we used the CLEAN algorithm
(Hurford et al. 2002) using the front detectors 3–9, ex-
cluding 4. For the spectral analysis we used only data
from the front segment of detector 6, as its spectrum
most closely resembles the mean spectrum based on the
measurements of all detectors, for the ∼4–100 keV en-
ergy band and an integration time of 28 s. The spectral
ﬁtting was computed using a combined model that in-
cludes one or more isothermal models and a thick-target
non-thermal emission model (Brown 1971; Holman et al.
2003).

In order to study the thermal evolution of the ﬂare
plasma, we also calculated the Diﬀerential Emission
Measure (DEM) maps for the early phase of the M9.0
ﬂare, using the Sparse inversion method (Cheung et al.
2015), with the new settings proposed by Su et al.
(2018).

3. RESULTS

3.1. Event Overview

On 2012 October 20, AR NOAA 11598 produced four
ﬂares on the Eastern limb of the Sun: a C1.8 ﬂare
(GOES SXR peak time 14:44 UT), a C2.4 ﬂare (peak
time 17:38 UT), an M9.0 ﬂare (peak time 18:14 UT)
and a C2.7 ﬂare (peak time 20:09 UT). All were con-
ﬁned events, except for the M9.0 ﬂare, which had a slow
CME associated, with a projected speed of ∼320 km s−1
(Gopalswamy et al. 2009). In this paper, we mainly con-
centrate on the activity that led to the eruptive M9.0
ﬂare peaking at 18:14 UT (SOL20121020T18:14). This
includes a detailed study of the early phase of the M9.0
ﬂare, as well as of the preceding conﬁned C2.4 ﬂare
(SOL20121020T17:38) and how the two ﬂare events are
related to each other.

The top panel of Fig. 1 shows the RHESSI X-ray count
rates at diﬀerent energy bands constructed using the
front segments of detectors 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, along

with the GOES 1–8 ˚A SXR ﬂux. The bottom panels
show the coronal EUV emission for selected times in AIA
304, 193 and 131 ˚A images. An animation1 is attached
to this image showing the evolution of the ﬂare in co-
temporal maps at 304, 193 and 131 ˚A for the ﬁeld of
view (FOV) represented in the ﬁgure (animation 1).

RHESSI data covered part of the decay phase of the
conﬁned C2.4 ﬂare and the full evolution of the eruptive
M9.0 ﬂare. Note that between ∼17:46 and ∼18:08 UT,
RHESSI observed continuously in attenuator state A0.
Therefore, the data during that time span are of high
sensitivity. The early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare terminates
with the sudden X-ray enhancement at 18:07:30 UT.
The rest of the impulsive phase is characterized by two
HXR bursts in the 25–50 and 50–100 keV energy bands
peaking at around 18:10 and 18:12 UT (see Fig. 1).

AIA images reveal the presence of a dark ﬁlament (see
white arrow in Fig 1). Prior observations to the C2.4
ﬂare do not show signatures of this ﬁlament. There-
fore, in order to ﬁnd out whether or not the ﬁlament
was present prior to the C2.4 ﬂare, we have explored
STEREO-B (ST-B) EUVI observations. On that day,
ST-B was separated by 126◦ in longitude from Earth,
thus viewing the event on disk. Fig. 2 shows on-disk
images of the AR by ST-B at 195 ˚A. It can be observed
that the ﬁlament was already present prior to the con-
ﬁned C2.4 ﬂare. Further observations also showed that
it was also present prior to the C1.8 ﬂare observed ﬁrst
in the series of events.

For a thorough characterization of the initiation and
early phases of the eruptive M9.0 ﬂare, and how it
leads to its impulsive phase, we separate the descrip-
tion in three parts. In Section 3.2 we study the conﬁned
C2.4 ﬂare and present observations of the most plausi-
ble mechanism responsible for the initiation of the rise
of the ﬁlament. In Section 3.3 we study the early phase
of the M9.0 ﬂare, and give observational evidence of a
slow quasi-static rise of the ﬁlament preceded by a pre-
cursor phase, signatures of particle acceleration and the
formation of a hot channel. In Section 3.4 we present a
description of the impulsive phase of the M9.0 ﬂareand

the ﬁlament activation.

at a stable height for ∼10 minutesthereby becoming part
of the early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare, where transient
brightenings are observed to occur beneath the ﬁlament
while the ﬁlament is at this new (higher) equilibrium
(see Fig. 3(h,i)).

3.3. Early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare

Fig. 4(d) shows a composite time-distance plot for slit
2 (see slit 2 represented in Fig. 4(c)) for the early and
impulsive phases of the M9.0 ﬂare (see shaded area in
Fig. 4(b)). During the early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare,
the ﬁlament can be observed to undergo a slow quasi-
static rise with a projected velocity of ∼5 km/s (see
Fig. 4(d) and animations 1 and 2). Transient brighten-
ings that occur below the ﬁlament during the rise are
also observed, indicating that the corona is undergoing
small-scale structural changes (for comparison see also
Fig. 3(i)).

Subsequent to this phase of slow rise, an acceleration
of the elevating structure takes place, and a faster rise
with a projected velocity of ∼25 km/s is observed, co-
temporal with a precursor phase, i.e., SXR activity in
the form of two distinct episodes of ﬂux enhancement
in the 6–12 and 12–25 keV RHESSI count rates (see
the precursor phase delimited by the dotted lines in
Fig. 4(b,d)). In order to study the X-ray emission dur-
ing the early and impulsive phases, Fig. 5 shows a time
sequence of AIA 304, 193 and 131 ˚A images and their
corresponding RHESSI spectra. RHESSI contours lev-
els at 60, 70, 80 and 90% of the maximum emission are
plotted for 3–8 (red), 8–20 (blue) and 20–50 keV (green)
energy bands on top of the AIA 193 ˚A images.

Two thermal X-ray sources in the energy range of 3–
8 keV are ﬁrstly observed (see images at 18:00:07 and
18:03:43 UT in Fig. 5). This represents hot X-ray emit-
ting plasma in coronal loops before the M9.0 ﬂare (see
also EM maps for hot plasma at 6–12 MK in Fig. 7). At
the ﬁrst peak of the SXR precursor phase (see third col-
umn in Fig. 5), the ﬁlament brightened (best observed
in AIA 131 ˚A). The RHESSI X-ray emission at 3–8 keV
is more compact and comes from below the ﬁlament.
More energetic X-ray emission in the range of 8–20 keV
appear, located to the north and south of the 3–8 keV
source.

For a better overview of the X-ray sources at this time,
Fig. 6 shows the zoomed AIA images at 304, 193 and
131 ˚A at the time of the ﬁrst precursor. The 8–20 keV
emission originates close to the observable ends of the
ﬁlament, where it starts to brighten (see corresponding
image at 131 ˚A). AIA 1600 ˚A observations do not show
signatures of foot points at this time and therefore they
are occulted behind the limb. Hence, we identify the

M9.0 ﬂare. An animation is attached to this ﬁgure (an-
imation 2) showing the composite sequence for the two
ﬂares. During the course of the conﬁned C2.4 ﬂare, a
ﬂare loop arcade is observed to form (see Fig. 3(a,b)).
Overlying the forming loop arcade, bundles of large-
scale coronal loops (labeled “[1]” and “[2]”) are observed
to approach each other (best observed in AIA 171 ˚A).
This converging motion of the loops is co-temporal with
an increase of hot emission high in the corona as ob-
served in AIA 131 ˚A (compare Fig. 3(a,b)). This sug-
gests localized heating, most likely due to reconnection,
high in the corona. Fig. 4(a) shows a composite time-
distance plot during the two events for slit 1 (represented
by the white dashed line in Fig. 4(c)), for comparison,
Fig. 4(b) shows the RHESSI count rates and GOES ﬂux
as depicted in Fig. 1. The time-distance plot reveals
that loops overlying the post-reconnected arcades con-
verge (see cool converging loops observed in AIA 304
and 171 ˚A marked with white dashed lines in Fig. 4(a))
toward a hot emission region (in green) indicative of
heating. This suggests ongoing reconnection high above
the post-ﬂare loops of the C2.4 ﬂare.

During the decay phase of the C2.4 ﬂare, the post-ﬂare
loops are observed to cool down as is e.g. evidenced by
the decaying hot 131 ˚A emission and cool 193 and 171 ˚A
emission (see Fig. 3(d–i) and animation 1). This cooling
is co-temporal with the occurrence of transient bright-
enings and structural changes, as well as the rise of the
ﬁlament ∼20 minutes before its ejection (see Fig. 3(d,e)
and animation 2). This is followed by a slow rise of the
ﬁlament and its temporary stabilization at a higher al-
titude (see Fig. 3(f,g)). The signatures of heating in the
higher corona remain present during the ascent of the ﬁl-
ament, indicative of ongoing reconnection overlying the
ﬁlament (see also Fig. 4(a)). The ﬁlament is maintained

emission in the 8–20 keV energy range to originate from
the legs of the ﬁlament. The spectral analysis reveals the
thermal nature of the 3–8 keV source with T ∼10 MK,
and also the existence of non-thermal emission at ener-
gies (cid:38)12 keV, indicative of plasma heating and particle
acceleration during the early phase (see Fig. 5).

The subsequent X-ray emission during the early phase
is characterized by two compact sources located below
the ﬁlament with the exception of the 8–20 keV source
at the time of the second precursor (i.e. 18:05:07 UT, see
Fig. 5), found to be located at the the southern leg of
the elevating ﬁlament, which has become brighter at this
time (compare Fig. 2(d) with the ﬁfth AIA 131 ˚A image
in Fig. 5) indicative of heating. The twisted morphol-
ogy of the structure comprising the elevating ﬁlament
starts to become observable at this time (see the inset
in Fig. 5). This twisted nature indicates that this struc-
ture may be a ﬂux rope (e.g. Cheng et al. 2013a). This
will be discussed in Sect. 3.5. The strongest emission of
the X-ray sources is located beneath the rising ﬁlament,
where a newly reconnected arcade is being formed (see
Fig. 5). The spectra show that the non-thermal power-
law spectra become ﬂatter, due to electrons accelerated
to higher energies. The temperature of the plasma as
measured from the thermal ﬁtting is also observed to
increase.

3.4. Ejection and impulsive phase of the M9.0 ﬂare

At the beginning of the impulsive phase (see images
at 18:08:43 UT in Fig. 5), the ﬁlament has considerably
risen and a newly detected HXR source in the 20–50 keV
energy range appears, co-spatial with those at 3–8 and
8–20 keV. The maximum emission of the X-ray sources
comes from the location where the reconnected arcade
is being formed (compare images at 193 and 131 ˚A at
18:08:43 UT in Fig. 5). Further X-ray observations re-
veal emission in the 3–50 keV energy range coming from
this location until the end of the impulsive phase (i.e.
∼18:15 UT).

We emphasize that the fast rise of the ﬁlament is co-
temporal with a steep increase of the HXR (25–50 keV)
emission (see Fig. 4(b,c)). The projected velocity of the
ejection during the impulsive phase is ∼200 km s−1.
The overarching coronal loops interact with the erupt-
ing structure (see eruption front in Fig. 4(a,d)), and the
overarching ﬁelds are displaced in northward direction
(see animation 2). A post-reconnection loop arcade be-
comes visible in the low corona co-spatial with HXR
emission. After the ejection, the pre-ﬂare conﬁguration
of the overarching loops is restored and they are ob-
served to oscillate (see Fig. 4(a)). These oscillations
have been identiﬁed as kink oscillations (Nakariakov

et al. 1999; Goddard et al. 2016). The HXR curve un-
dergoes further rise peaking at ∼18:12:30 UT, which co-
incides with the epoch when the large-scale loops reach
their minimum height (see dashed lines in Fig. 4(b,d)).
Fig. 1(h) shows the late magnetic structure left by this
ﬂare, the post-ﬂare loops are visible in the low corona
together with the very hot overarching coronal loops vis-
ible in hotter channels (see animation 2 for a composite
view of the decay phase of the M9.0 ﬂare).

3.5. Analysis of ﬁlament activation and hot channel

formation

Motivated by the fact that the ﬁlament underwent a
pre-heating phase before its ejection (see last image in
AIA 131 in Fig. 5), we present in this section EUV and
DEM analyses using the AIA EUV images of the early
phase of the event with the aim of determining precisely
when and how the heating of the ﬁlament occurred.

Fig. 4(e–h) shows a sequence of composite images
of the solar corona, as observed in the three wave-
bands 304 ˚A (blue), 171 ˚A (pink) and 131 ˚A (green).
Corresponding times are indicated by black arrows [1–
4] in Fig. 4(b). These still images are representative
of the early and impulsive phases. The sequence re-
veals the formation and evolution of a hot channel (in
green), in agreement with the ﬁndings in Zhang et al.
(2012). The sequential heating suggests that the hot
channel was formed as a consequence of the heating
of a pre-existing structure within the ﬂux rope. The
black and white crosses represent the apex of the hot
channel at 18:05:12 UT and 18:08:34 UT respectively.
The black and white squares represent the apex of the
post-ﬂare loop left by the C2.4 ﬂare at 18:08:34 UT and
18:00:10 UT respectively.

Based on the comparison of Fig. 4(e,f), the hot chan-
nel must have formed around 18:05 UT, i.e., ∼2 minutes
before the impulsive onset of the M9.0 ﬂare. In the sub-
sequent intervals (i.e. during the precursor phase and
early impulsive phase), the hot ﬁlament channel rose in
altitude (by ∼5 arcsec; compare the black and white
crosses in Fig. 4(f,g) marking the apparent apex of the
ﬂux rope structure). Noteworthy is the rise of the post-
ﬂare loops left by the C2.4 ﬂare, which also rose in alti-
tude with the rising hot channel (by ∼3 arcsec; compare
the black and white squares in Fig. 4(g,h)). Animation
2 shows the interaction of the overlying post-ﬂare loops
left by the C2.4 ﬂare and the elevating structure, co-
temporal with the sudden increase in the RHESSI HXRs
(compare with Fig. 4(b)).

Exploration of the formation mechanisms of hot chan-
nels is fundamental in the understanding of the initia-
tion processes of CMEs and ﬂares. To understand the

formation of the hot ﬂux rope in detail, we performed
a DEM analysis and present EM and weighted temper-
ature maps in Fig. 7, covering the early and early im-
pulsive phases of the M9.0 ﬂare. The EM maps are
shown for two temperature ranges, 1–2 MK (top row
panels) and at 6–12 MK (second row panels). RHESSI
X-ray emission at the time of the ﬁrst SXR precursor
(i.e. ∼18:04:30 UT) is displayed on top of the 6–12 MK
EM map at 18:06:08 UT. Contours are drawn for the 3–
8 keV (in red) and for 8–20 keV (in blue) energy band, at
70 and 90% of the maximum emission. The attached on-
line animation (animation 3) clearly depicts the heating
of the ﬁlament during the early ﬂare phase. At the time
when the two non-thermal X-ray sources appeared co-
spatial with the legs of the ﬂux rope (i.e. ∼18:04 UT),
the 6–12 MK EM map does not show signiﬁcant en-
hancement from those locations. This indicates slow
heating at the time where the non-thermal sources were
found.

At ∼18:06:08 UT the ﬁlament started to rise and
heat. The weighted T-maps reveal that ﬁrst the legs of
the ﬁlament channel heat up and subsequently its apex
(compare weighted T-maps at 6–12 MK at 18:06:08 and
18:08:20 UT).

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We present detailed analyses of ﬂare activity observed
above the solar limb essential to understand the ac-
tivation and ejection of a pre-existing ﬁlament, which
led to an eruptive M9.0 ﬂare (SOL20121020T18:14) in
NOAA 11598. The pre-CME activities include plasma
heating and particle acceleration, as well as plasma mo-
tions in and around the pre-existing ﬁlament. Notewor-
thy, we were also able to image the sequential formation
of an associated hot channnel, indicative of a hot ﬂux
rope.

The ﬁrst distinct physical signature of early activity,
that set a favorable conﬁguration for an ejection, oc-
curred during the decay phase of the preceding conﬁned
C2.4 ﬂare, ∼20 minutes before the eruption. This was
the rise of the low-lying ﬁlament to a higher position of
equilibrium (see Fig. 3(d–i)). The phase of activation
and ascent of the ﬁlament during which it moves to a
stable height prior to its subsequent successful eruption
has been observed in earlier studies (e.g. Patsourakos
et al. 2013; Joshi et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014; Joshi
et al. 2016). High above the ﬁlament, we evidenced sig-
natures for coronal magnetic reconnection in the form of
heating above the ﬁlament and in addition, converging
motions of coronal loops toward the probable reconnec-
tion region (Fig. 4(a)). This reconnection of high coronal
loops above the ﬁlament results in the reorganization of

coronal ﬁelds and reduces the tension of the overlying
loops, aﬀecting the force equilibrium of the low-lying
magnetic structure and facilitating its slow expansion,
therefore causing its destabilization (Chen et al. 2016).
Furthermore, SXR emission in the range of 3–8 keV,
was found to be co-spatial with the hot emission pro-
duced during the course of the C2.4 ﬂare (see Fig. 5),
representative of hot X-ray emitting plasma in coronal
loops.

During the early phase of the eruptive M9.0 ﬂare (see
Fig. 4(d)), we observed a slow quasi-static rise of the ﬁl-
ament with a projected speed of ∼5 km/s, at the time of
its activation, co-temporal with EUV brightenings below
the ﬁlament (compare with Fig. 3(h,i)), indicative of re-
sistive processes. SXR precursors, indicative of the time
scale and strength of episodic small-scale energy release
(similar to what was reported by, e.g., Liu et al. (2009)
(see Fig.1a therein)), were observed co-temporal with an
increase in the projected velocity of the rise of the ﬁla-
ment (compare Fig. 4(b,d)). This can be explained by
the slow expansion of the ﬁlament, that causes internal
reconnection, which also promotes the further expan-
sion of the system (Sterling & Moore 2001; Joshi et al.
2016). In fact, the synthesis of X-ray and EUV obser-
vations during the precursor phase (see Fig. 5 and 6)
provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection oc-
curred within the core region of the ﬂaring environment,
below the apex of a quasi-stationary low-lying ﬂux rope
as well as close to its two end points (Fig. 6). This
points toward the small-scale localized magnetic recon-
nection, taking place in the core ﬁelds (Moore & Roume-
liotis 1992; Moore et al. 2001). The slight yet distinct
non-thermal component of the X-ray emission observed
during this phase implies the acceleration of particles
resulting from these reconnection events.

The slow quasi-static rise of the ﬁlament was followed
by an increase in the upward velocity of the ﬁlament
(see Fig. 4(d)), indicating that an additional triggering
episode took place, further destabilizing the system and
causing its ejection. The X-ray sources detected below
the ascending ﬂux rope, co-spatial with the locations
where the low-lying post-reconnected loops formed, are
indicative of resistive processes at this location. The sec-
ond triggering episode could therefore be explained as a
combination of (1) an ideal instability, supported by the
continuous quasi-static rise of the magnetic structure,
and (2) tether-cutting reconnection, supported by the
observation of X-ray sources below the rising magnetic
structure already during the precursor phase.

The fast rise of the magnetic structure is co-temporal
with the steep increase in the HXR (25–50 keV) emis-
sion (compare Fig. 4(b,d)). Two processes can ener-

gize the CME, (1) the large-scale Lorentz force acting
on the ﬂux rope, and/or (2) the dissipative process of
reconnection Cheng et al. (2017). The outward contri-
bution of the newly reconnected ﬁelds below the rising
ﬂux rope provide additional poloidal ﬂux increasing the
hoop force and contributing to the ﬂux rope acceler-
ation (Vrˇsnak 2016). As shown in the simulations by
Chen et al. (2007), the two processes often occur syn-
chronously and provide positive feedback to each other.
Thus, they are often not separable through present ob-
servations.

AIA DEM analysis revealed the formation of a hot
channel as a sequential heating of a pre-existing loop
within the ﬂux rope. Hot channels were ﬁrst reported
in (Zhang et al. 2012), and have been regarded as evi-
dence of magnetic ﬂux ropes. Our observations show two
main diﬀerences with respect to their observations: 1.
the earliest signature of the hot channel was observed
as early as ∼2 minutes before the SXR onset instead
of ∼6 minutes. This was evidenced by two localized
EUV enhancements at the location of the legs of the
ﬁlament co-spatial with two non-thermal sources (see
Fig. 6). This shows that hot channels can be formed
its formation
very close in time to their ejection; 2.
occurred along with the slow rise of the ﬂux rope.The
temperature of the isothermal plasma as measured from
the thermal ﬁtting is also observed to increase.

Based on these results, we conclude that 1. a ﬁrst
triggering episode occurred during the decay phase of
the C2.4 ﬂare as a consequence of magnetic reconnection
of coronal loops overlying the ﬁlament. This reduced the
tension of the overlying ﬁelds, leading to the rise of the
ﬁlament to a higher position where no stable equilibrium
existed (Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Forbes & Priest 1995;

Lin & Forbes 2000), 2. after the quasi-static rise of
the ﬁlament during the early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare,
a second triggering episode occurredmost probably as
a combination of an ideal instability and tether-cutting
reconnection.

In summary, we show that the major eruption oc-
curred as a consequence of two distinct triggering
episodes separated in time by ∼17 minutes. The ﬁrst
trigger occurred as early as ∼20 minutes before the
onset, i.e. when the ﬁlament was destabilized during
the preceding conﬁned C-class ﬂare. This left the mag-
netic conﬁguration in a state where equilibrium was no
longer possible, leading to a subsequent quasi-static rise
of the ﬁlament during the early phase of the M9.0 ﬂare
until a second triggering episode occurred ∼3 minutes
before the onset. Our work highlights the importance
in extending ﬂare studies by also considering preceding
(possibly conﬁned) ﬂare events during the early phase
of eruptive ﬂares, in order to understand the initiation
of large ﬂares and their associated fast eruptions.
