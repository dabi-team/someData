ABELIAN QUOTIENTS ARISING FROM EXTRIANGULATED
CATEGORIES VIA MORPHISM CATEGORIES

ZENGQIANG LIN

Abstract. We investigate abelian quotients arising from extriangulated cate-
gories via morphism categories, which is a uniﬁed treatment for both exact cat-
egories and triangulated categories. Let (C, E, s) be an extriangulated category
with enough projectives P and M be a full subcategory of C containing P. We
show that certain quotient category of s-def(M), the category of s-deﬂations
f : M1 → M2 with M1, M2 ∈ M, is abelian. Our main theorem has two appli-
cations. If M = C, we obtain that certain ideal quotient category s-tri(C)/R2
is equivalent to the category of ﬁnitely presented modules mod-C/[P], where
s-tri(C) is the category of all s-triangles. If M is a rigid subcategory, we show
that ML/[M] ∼
= (mod-(M/[P])op)op, where
ML (resp. ΩM) is the full subcategory of C of objects X admitting an s-

with M1, M2 ∈ M (resp. M ∈ M and P ∈ P).

1. introduction

In representation theory, there are a few quotient categories admitting natural
abelian structures. For both triangulated categories and exact categories, cluster-
tilting subcategories provide a way to construct abelian quotient categories. Let C
be a triangulated category and T be a cluster-tilting subcategory of C, then the
quotient C/[T ] is abelian; related works see [1, 8, 9]. The version of exact categories
see [2]. Submodule categories provide another way to construct abelian quotient
categories. Certain quotients of submodule categories are realized as categories of
ﬁnitely presented modules over stable Auslander algebras [16, 3]. More generally,
some quotients of categories of short exact sequences in exact categories are abelian,
related works see [4, 10]. For triangulated version, certain quotients of categories
of triangles are abelian [14].

Recently, Nakaoka and Palu introduced the notion of extriangulated categories
[15], which is a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated
categories. They pointed out that the notion is a convenient setup for writing
down proofs which apply to both exact categories and triangulated categories. For
recent developments on extriangulated categories we refer to [6, 11, 12, 13, 17] etc.
In this paper, we focus our attention onto the abelian quotients arising from
extriangulated categories via morphism categories, which is a uniﬁed treatment of

abelian quotients for both exact categories and triangulated categories. Our ap-
proach to abelian quotients is based on identifying quotients of morphism categories
as certain module categories.

Let (C, E, s) be an extriangulated category and M be a full subcategory of C. We
denote by Mor(M) the morphism category of M and by s-def(M) (resp. s-inf(M))
the full subcategory of Mor(M) consisting of s-deﬂations (resp. s-inﬂations). The
full subcategory of s-def(M) consisting of split epimorphisms (resp. split monomor-
phisms) is denoted by s-epi(M) (resp. s-mono(M)). We denote by sp-epi(M) (resp.
si-mono(M)) the full subcategory of s-def(M) consisting of (M 1−→ M ) ⊕ (P → M ′)
(resp. (M 1−→ M ) ⊕ (M ′ → I)) with P ∈ P (resp. I ∈ I).

Our main theorem is the following (Theorem 3.2), which generalizes [10, Theorem

3.9].

Theorem 1.1. Let C be an extriangulated category and M be a full subcategory of
C.

(1) If C has enough projectives P and M contains P, then s-def(M)/[s-epi(M)] ∼=

mod-M/[P] and s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op.

(2) If C has enough injectives I and M contains I, then s-inf(M)/[s-mono(M)] ∼=

(mod-(M/[I])op)op and s-inf(M)/[si-mono(M)] ∼= mod-M/[I].

Theorem 1.1 has two interesting applications. We will investigate two special
cases when M = C and when M is rigid, that is, E(M, M ′) = 0 for any M, M ′ ∈ M.
For the ﬁrst case, we denote by s-tri(C) the category of all s-triangles, where

the objects are the s-triangles X• = ( X1
) and the mor-
phisms from X• to Y• are the triples ϕ• = (ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3) such that the following

is a morphism of s-triangles. Let X• and Y• be two s-triangles, we denote by
R2(X•, Y•) the class of morphisms ϕ• : X• → Y• such that ϕ3 factors through g2.
It is easy to see that R2 is an ideal of s-tri(C), moreover, the following three quotient
categories s-tri(C)/R2, s-def(C)/[s-epi(C)] and s-inf(C)/[s-mono(C)] are equivalent.

), we deﬁne the con-
travariant defect δ∗ and the covariant defect δ∗ by the following exact sequence of
functors

−−−−−→ C(−, X3) → δ∗ → 0,
C(f1,−)
−−−−−→ C(X1, −) → δ∗ → 0.

Our ﬁrst application of Theorem 1.1 is the following (Theorem 4.1, Proposition
4.3 and Theorem 4.8), which generalizes [10, Theorem 4.1, Theorem 4.8, Theorem
5.1].

Theorem 1.2. Let C be an extriangulated category.

(1) The quotient s-tri(C)/R2 is abelian.
(2) If C has enough projectives P, then we have the following equivalence

F : s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= mod-C/[P], δ 7→ δ∗.

(3) If C has enough injectives I, then we have the following equivalence

G : s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= (mod-(C/[I])op)op, δ 7→ δ∗.
We point out that the abelian quotient s-tri(C)/R2 admits nice properties. We
describe the projectives, injectives and simple objects in s-tri(C)/R2; see Propo-
sition 4.4 and Proposition 4.6. In particular, if C has enough projectives P and
enough injectives I, then there is a duality between mod-C/[P] and mod-(C/[I])op,
which is used to derive Auslander-Reiten duality and defect formula for extriangu-
lated categories; see Proposition 4.9.

For describing the second application, we ﬁrst give some notations. Let C′ and
C′′ be two full subcategories of C. We denote by Cocone(C′, C′′) (resp. Cone(C′, C′′))
/❴❴❴
the subcategory of objects X admitting an s-triangle X
/ X
(resp. C′

/ C′
) with C′ ∈ C′ and C′′ ∈ C′′.

/❴❴❴

/ C′′

/ C′′

Let M be a rigid subcategory of C. For convenience we let ML = Cocone(M, M)
and MR = Cone(M, M).
If C has enough projectives P and enough injectives
I, then we let ΩM=Cocone(P, M) and ΣM=Cone(M, I). It turns out that the
quotient categories s-def(M)/[s-epi(M)] and s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)] can be realized
as subquotient categories of C.

Our second application of Theorem 1.1 is the following (Theorem 5.4), which

generalizes [2, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.4] and [7, Proposition 6.2].

Theorem 1.3. Let C be an extriangulated category and M be a rigid subcategory
of C.

(1) If C has enough projectives P and M contains P, then ML/[M] ∼= mod-(M/[P])

and ML/[ΩM] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op.

and MR/[ΣM] ∼= mod-(M/[I]).

(2) If C has enough injectives I and M contains I, then MR/[M] ∼= (mod-(M/[I])op)op

In particular, if M is a cluster tilting subcategory of C, then ML = MR = C.

Thus we have the following result (Corollary 5.7).

Corollary 1.4. Let C be an extriangulated category with enough projectives P and
enough injectives I. If M is a cluster tilting subcategory of C, then

(1) C/[M] ∼= mod-(M/[P]) ∼= (mod-(M/[I])op)op.
(2) C/[ΩM] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op.
(3) C/[ΣM] ∼= mod-(M/[I]).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we make some preliminaries on
morphism categories and extriangulated categories. In Section 3 we prove Theorem
1.1. In Section 4 we provide the ﬁrst application. In Section 5 we provide the second
application.

2. definitions and preliminaries

In this section, we ﬁrst give some facts on morphism categories, then recall the
deﬁnitions and basic properties on extriangulated categories from [15], [11] and [6].

2.1. Morphism categories. Let C be an additive category. The morphism cat-
egory of C is the category Mor(C) deﬁned by the following data. The objects of
Mor(C) are all the morphisms f : X → Y in C. The morphisms from f : X → Y to
f ′ : X ′ → Y ′ are pairs (a, b) where a : X → X ′ and b : Y → Y ′ such that bf = f ′a.
The composition of morphisms is componentwise. For two objects f : X → Y

and f ′ : X ′ → Y ′ in Mor(C), we deﬁne R(f, f ′) (resp. R′(f, f ′)) to be the set of
morphisms (a, b) such that there is some morphism p : Y → X ′ such that f ′p = b
(resp. pf = a). Then R and R′ are ideals of Mor(C). We denote by s-epi(C) (resp.
s-mono(C)) the full subcategory of Mor(C) consisting of split epimorphisms (resp.
split monomorphisms).

Recall that a right C-module is a contravariantly additive functor F : C → Ab,
where Ab is the category of abelian groups. A C-module F is called ﬁnitely presented
if there exists an exact sequence C(−, X) → C(−, Y ) → F → 0. We denote by mod-
C the category of ﬁnitely presented C-modules, and by proj-C (resp. inj-C) the full
subcategory of mod-C consisting of projectives (resp. injectives).

The following result was proved in [10, Lemma 3.1] and [10, Proposition 3.3].

Lemma 2.1. Let C be an additive category, then
(1) Mor(C)/R ∼= Mor(C)/[s-epi(C)] ∼= mod-C.
(2) Mor(C)/R′ ∼= Mor(C)/[s-mono(C)] ∼= (mod-Cop)op.

2.2. Extriangulated categories. Let C be an additive category equipped with
an additive bifunctor E : Cop × C → Ab. For any pair of objects A, C ∈ C, an
object δ ∈ E(C, A) is called an E-extension. For any morphism a ∈ C(A, A′) and
c ∈ C(C′, C), we denote the E-extension E(C, a)(δ) ∈ E(C, A′) by a∗δ and denote
the E-extension E(c, A)(δ) ∈ E(C′, A) by c∗δ. Let δ ∈ E(C, A) and δ′ ∈ E(C′, A′)
be two E-extensions. A morphism (a, c) : δ → δ′ of E-extensions is a pair of
morphisms a ∈ C(A, A′) and c ∈ C(C, C′) such that a∗δ = c∗δ′.

Let A, C ∈ C be any pair of objects. Two sequences of morphisms in C

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let E : Cop ×C → Ab be an additive bifunctor. A correspondence s

is called a realization of E if it associates an equivalence class s(δ) = [A

to any E-extension δ ∈ E(C, A) and associates a commutative diagram

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let (C, E, s) be an extriangulated category.

(1) An object P ∈ C is called projective if for any s-deﬂation y : B → C and any
morphism c : P → C, there exists a morphism b : P → B such that yb = c. The
full subcategory of projectives is denoted by P.

(2) We say that C has enough projectives if for any object C ∈ C there exists an

Example 2.6. [15, Example 3.26] (1) Let C be an exact category, then C is an
extriangulated category with E(−, −) = Ext1
C(−, −). In particular, if C is an exact
category with enough projectives, then C is an extriangulated category with enough
projectives.

(2) Let C be a triangulated category with shift functor [1], then C is an extrian-
gulated category with E(−, −) = C(−, −[1]). Moreover, C has enough projectives.
In this case, P consists of zero objects.

The following lemmas will be used frequently later.

(2) If h : X → Z is a morphism in C and g : Y → Z is an s-deﬂation such
that gf = h in Mor-C/[P], then there exists an object P ∈ P and two morphisms

Proof. (1) The ﬁrst assertion follows from [15, Corollary 3.16] or the dual of Lemma
2.8. The second assertion is clear.

(2) Since gf = h, there is an object P ∈ P and two morphisms u : X → P and
w : P → Z such that gf − h = wu. Since g : Y → Z is an s-deﬂation, there exists

a morphism v : P → Y such that w = gv. Therefore, g(f − vu) = h.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1
Throughout this paper, we assume that (C, E, s) is an extriangulated category.
Let M be a full subcategory of C. We denote by s-def(M) (resp. s-inf(M)) the
full subcategory of Mor(M) consisting of s-deﬂations (resp. s-inﬂations). Recall
that the full subcategory of s-def(M) consisting of split epimorphisms (resp. split
monomorphisms) is denoted by s-epi(M) (resp. s-mono(M)). We denote by sp-
epi(M) (resp. si-mono(M)) the full subcategory of s-def(M) consisting of (M 1−→
M ) ⊕ (P → M ′) (resp. (M 1−→ M ) ⊕ (M ′ → I)) with P ∈ P (resp. I ∈ I).

M be a full subcategory of C containing P. Assume that the following

(1) The following statements are equivalent.

(a) The morphism b factors through f ′ in M/[P].
(b) The morphism b factors through f ′.
(c) The morphism (a, b) factors through some object in s-epi(M).

(2) The following statements are equivalent.

(a) The morphism a factors through f in M/[P].
(b) The morphism (a, b) factors through some object in sp-epi(M).

Proof. (1) Since (b)⇔(c) follows from Lemma 2.1 and (b)⇒(a) is clear, we only
1 such that f ′p = b.
prove (a)⇒(b). Suppose that there is a morphism p : M2 → M ′
By Lemma 2.11, there exists an object P ∈ P and two morphisms u : M2 → P and
v : P → M ′

1 such that f ′(p − vu) = b. Thus b factors through f ′.
(2) (a)⇒(b). Suppose that there is a morphism p : M2 → M ′
1 such that pf = a.
Since C has enough projectives, there is an s-deﬂation a1 : P → M ′
1 with P ∈ P.
It is easy to see that a − pf factors through a1. We assume that a − pf = a1a2
where a2 : M1 → P . Since (b − f ′p)f = f ′a − f ′pf = f ′a1a2, we have the following

Theorem 3.2. Let C be an extriangulated category and M be a full subcategory of
C.

(1) If C has enough projectives P and M contains P, then s-def(M)/[s-epi(M)] ∼=

mod-M/[P] and s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op.

(2) If C has enough injectives I and M contains I, then s-inf(M)/[s-mono(M)] ∼=

(mod-(M/[I])op)op and s-inf(M)/[si-mono(M)] ∼= mod-M/[I].

Proof. Since (2) is dual to (1), we only prove (1).

Deﬁne a functor

F : s-def(M) → Mor(M/[P]),

(M1

f
−→ M2) 7→ (M1

f
−→ M2).

For any object f : M1 → M2 in Mor(M/[P]), by Lemma 2.11 there is an object
P ∈ P and an s-deﬂation (f, −π) : M1 ⊕ P → M2 such that (f, −π) ∼= f . Therefore,
F (f, −π) ∼= f and F is dense.

Assume that f : M1 → M2 and f ′ : M ′

2 are objects in s-def(M) and (a, b)
is a morphism in Mor(M/[P]) from f to f ′. Then bf = f ′a. By Lemma 2.11, there
exists an object Q ∈ P and two morphisms u : M1 → Q and v : Q → M ′
1 such that
f ′(a − vu) = bf . Thus, F (a − vu, b) = (a, b) and the functor F is full.

1 → M ′

The functor F induces a full and dense functor

F : s-def(M) → Mor(M/[P])/R.
e
By Lemma 3.1(1), we have s-def(M)/[s-epi(C)] ∼= Mor(M/[P])/R. It follows that
s-def(M)/[s-epi(M)] ∼= mod-M/[P] by Lemma 2.1(1).

The functor F induces a full and dense functor

F : s-def(M) → Mor(M/[P])/R′.
b
By Lemma 3.1(2), we have s-def(M)/[sp-epi(C)] ∼= Mor(M/[P])/R′. It follows that
s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op by Lemma 2.1(2).

(1) If C has enough projectives P, then s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= mod-C/[P].
(2) If C has enough injectives I, then s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= (mod-(C/[I])op)op.

Proof. (1) We have s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= s-def(C)/[s-epi(C)] by Lemma 3.1. Thus s-tri(C)/R2 ∼=
mod-C/[P] follows from Theorem 3.2(1).

and δ∗ = C/[I](X, −).

The following result gives an explanation of [6, Theorem 4.1].

Theorem 4.8. Let C be an extriangulated category with enough projectives P and
enough injectives I.

(1) We have the following equivalences

s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= mod-C/[P] ∼= (mod-(C/[I])op)op.
Moreover, the equivalence F : s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= mod-C/[P] is given by δ 7→ δ∗ and the
equivalence G : s-tri(C)/R2 ∼= (mod-(C/[I])op)op is given by δ 7→ δ∗.

(2) The abelian category mod-C/[P] has enough projectives and enough injectives.
Moreover, each projective object is of the form C/[P](−, X), and each injective
object is of the form E(−, X).

(3) The abelian category mod-(C/[I])op has enough projectives and enough injec-
tives. Moreover, each projective object is of the form C/[I](X, −), and each injective
object is of the form E(X, −).

Proof. (1) The ﬁrst assertion follows from Theorem 4.1. Assume that

δ = ( X1

is an s-triangle. Recall that F (δ) = Coker(C/[P](−, f2)) and δ∗ = Coker(C(−, f2)).
Since δ∗(P) = 0, we can view δ∗ as a ﬁnitely presented C/[P]-module. Thus F (δ) =
δ∗. Similarly, we have G(δ) = δ∗.

(2) and (3) follows from (1), Proposition 4.4 and Example 4.7.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.9. Let C be an extriangulated category with enough projectives P and
enough injectives I. Then there is a duality

Φ : mod-C/[P] → mod-(C/[I])op,

δ∗ 7→ δ∗.

Moreover, by restrictions, we obtain the following two dualities

C/[P](−, X) 7→ E(X, −).
Φ : proj-C/[P] → inj-(C/[I])op,
Φ : inj-C/[P] → proj-(C/[I])op, E(−, X) 7→ C/[I](X, −).

Proof. It is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.8.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.10. ([6, Proposition 4.9]) Let C be an extriangulated category with
enough projectives P and enough injectives I.

(1) There is an isomorphism between C/[P](Y, X) and the group of natural trans-

formations from E(X, −) to E(Y, −).

(2) There is an isomorphism between C/[I](X, Y ) and the group of natural trans-

formations from E(−, X) to E(−, Y ).

Now we have the following Auslander-Reiten duality and defect formula for ex-

triangulated categories.

Proposition 4.11. Let C be an Ext-ﬁnite extriangulated category with enough pro-
jectives P and enough injectives I. Assume that either C/[P] or C/[I] is a dualizing
k-variety. Then there is an equivalence τ : C/[P] ∼= C/[I] satisfying the following
properties:

(1) DE(−, X) ∼= C/[P](τ −1X, −), DE(X, −) ∼= C/[I](−, τ X).
(2) Dδ∗ = δ∗τ −1, Dδ∗ = δ∗τ for each s-triangle δ.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that C/[I] is a dualizing k-variety.
The composition of Φ : mod-C/[P] → mod-(C/[I])op and D : mod-(C/[I])op →
mod-C/[I] deﬁnes an equivalence

Θ : mod-C/[P] Φ−→ mod-(C/[I])op D

−→ mod-C/[I].

It follows that Θ(C/[P](−, X)) = DE(X, −) ∼= C/[I](−, Y ) for some Y ∈ C. There-
fore, there is an equivalence τ : C/[P] ∼= C/[I] mapping X to Y . The equivalence
: mod-C/[P] ∼= mod-C/[I], F 7→ F τ −1, such that
τ induces an equivalence τ −1
∗ . Assume that δ is an s-triangle, then DΦ(δ∗) = Dδ∗. On the other
DΦ = τ −1
hand, τ −1
∗ (δ∗) = δ∗τ −1. Hence, we have Dδ∗ = δ∗τ −1. It follows that Dδ∗ = δ∗τ .
If δ = IX , then by Example 4.7 we have δ∗ = E(−, X) and δ∗ = C/I(X, −). There-
fore, we have DE(−, X) ∼= C/[I](X, τ −) ∼= C/[P](τ −1X, −) since Dδ∗ = δ∗τ .

5. Application to rigid subcategories

In this section, we will investigate the second application of Theorem 3.2 in the
case when M is a rigid subcategory of C, that is, E(M, M ′) = 0 for any objects
M, M ′ ∈ M.

Let C′ and C′′ be two full subcategories of C. We denote by Cocone(C′, C′′) the full
/❴❴❴
subcategory of C of objects X admitting an s-triangle X
with C′ ∈ C′ and C′′ ∈ C′′. We denote by Cone(C′, C′′) the full subcategory of
objects X admitting an s-triangle C′
with C′ ∈ C′ and
C′′ ∈ C′′.

For convenience we let ML = Cocone(M, M) and MR = Cone(M, M). If C has
enough projectives P, then we let ΩM=Cocone(P, M). If C has enough injectives
I, then we let ΣM=Cone(M, I).

Hence, k is a left M-approximation of X.

Lemma 5.3. Let C be an extriangulated category with enough projectives P and
M be a rigid subcategory of C containing P. Then

(1) s-def(M)/[s-epi(M)] ∼= ML/[M].
(2) s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)] ∼= ML/[ΩM].

morphism g : X → X ′ is not unique in general. Assume that g′ : X → X ′ is another
morphism such that (g′, a, b) is a morphism of s-triangles. Then (g − g′, 0, 0) is also
a morphism of s-triangles. Lemma 2.7 implies that g − g′ factors through k, that
is, g − g′ factors through M1 ∈ M. It follows that g = g′ in ML/[M].

Therefore, the assignment X 7→ (M1
functor G : ML → s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)].

It is easy to see that G is full and dense. Lemma 5.2(2) implies that G induces
(cid:3)

an equivalence ML/[ΩM] ∼= s-def(M)/[sp-epi(M)].

Theorem 5.4. Let C be an extriangulated category and M be a rigid subcategory
of C.

(1) If C has enough projectives P and M contains P, then ML/[M] ∼= mod-(M/[P])

and ML/[ΩM] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op.

(2) If C has enough injectives I and M contains I, then MR/[M] ∼= (mod-(M/[I])op)op

and MR/[ΣM] ∼= mod-(M/[I]).
Proof. We only prove (1). It follows from Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.3.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.5. ([11, Deﬁnition 5.3]) Let C be an extriangulated category with
enough projectives and enough injectives. A full subcategory M is called n-cluster
tilting for some integer n ≥ 2, if it satisﬁes the following conditions.

(1) M is functorially ﬁnite in C.
(2) X ∈ M if and only if Ei(X, M) = 0 for i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 1}.
(3) X ∈ M if and only if Ei(M, X) = 0 for i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 1}.

In particular, a 2-cluster tilting subcategory of C is simply called cluster tilting

subcategory.

Assume that M is an n-cluster tilting subcategory. Deﬁne

⊥n−2M = {X ∈ C|Ei(X, M) = 0, i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 2}}
and M⊥n−2 = {X ∈ C|Ei(M, X) = 0, i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 2}}.
Proposition 5.6. Let M be an n-cluster tilting subcategory of an extriangulated
category C, then ML =⊥n−2 M and MR = M⊥n−2.

/ C δ
Proof. We only prove the ﬁrst equation. Let X ∈⊥n−2 M and X x
be an s-triangle with I ∈ I. Assume that f : X → M is a left M-approximation
of X. By Lemma 2.8, we have the following morphism of s-triangles

is an s-triangle. We claim that C′ ∈ M,
such that X
thus X ∈ ML. In fact, for each M ′ ∈ M, by Lemma 2.10 we have the following
exact sequence
C(C′, M ′) → C(M ⊕ I, M ′) → C(X, M ′) → E(C′, M ′) → E(M ⊕ I, M ′) → E(X, M ′)
→ · · · → Ei(M ⊕ I, M ′) → Ei(X, M ′) → Ei+1(C′, M ′) → Ei+1(M ⊕ I, M ′) → · · · .
Since Ei(M ⊕ I, M ′) = Ei+1(M ⊕ I, M ′) = 0, we get Ei(X, M ′) ∼= Ei+1(C′, M ′) for
i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 2}. Thus, as X ∈⊥n−2 M, Ei(C′, M ′) = 0 if 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Noting
that f : X → M is a left M-approximation, we have E(C′, M ′) = 0. Therefore
C′ ∈ M.

Suppose that X ∈ ML. There exists an s-triangle X

/ M1
with M1, M2 ∈ M. For any M ∈ M, we have an exact sequence
0 = Ei(M1, M ) → Ei(X, M ) → Ei+1(M2, M ) = 0

for i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 2}. Therefore, X ∈⊥n−2 M.

Corollary 5.7. Let C be an extriangulated category with enough projectives P and
enough injectives I. If M is a cluster tilting subcategory of C, then

(1) C/[M] ∼= mod-(M/[P]) ∼= (mod-(M/[I])op)op.
(2) C/[ΩM] ∼= (mod-(M/[P])op)op.
(3) C/[ΣM] ∼= mod-(M/[I]).

Remark 5.8. Let M be a cluster tilting subcategory of an extriangulated cate-
gory C. Then the quotient category C/[M] is abelian can follows from the theory
of cotorsion pairs on extriangulated categories or that of one-sided triangulated
categories; see [11, Theorem 3.2] and [5, Theorem 3.3].
