The  in-depth  oxygen  diffusion  into  a  low  density  polyethylene  film  is  performed  in  the  post-discharge  of  an 
atmospheric plasma torch, supplied in argon as carrier gas and with or without oxygen as reactive gas. The chemical 
and structural properties of the polymer surface and bulk are studied in terms of plasma parameters (treatment 
time,  power,  and  reactive  gas  flow  rate).  A  good  correlation  between  XPS  and  Fourier  transform  infrared 
spectroscopy analyses is demonstrated. The penetration depth of oxygen into the bulk of the polymer is investigated 
by angle resolved-XPS and time-of-flight SIMS. It is shown that, depending on the plasma conditions, oxygen could 
penetrate up to 20–40nm into the low density polyethylene during the atmospheric plasma treatment. 

1. Introduction 

For specific application, a polymer cannot be selected by only considering its bulk properties because its surface state usually plays a 

vital role. Low density polyethylene (LDPE), widely used in food packaging industry, presents no specific chemical functionality on its 

surface. It can therefore be modified to enhance its adhesion properties so as to subsequently deposit barrier layers dedicated to the 

food packaging. The surface activation could be accompanied by a slight etching process, which improves the surface roughness, hence 

increasing its hydrophilicity and furthermore the adhesion of the subsequent layer.[1]  

Plasma treatment is known as a very effective way to enhance the hydrophilicity of a polymer surface by only modifying the outermost 

atomic layers without affecting its intrinsic bulk properties.[2,3] Etching, cleaning, crosslinking, and grafting are the main interactions 

that  may  occur  on  polymer  surfaces.[4]  Low  pressure  and  atmospheric  pressure  plasmas  have  found  widespread  use  for  the 

pretreatment  of  polymers  in  industrial  applications.  Plasmas,  such  as  dielectric  barrier  discharges  (DBD)  and  radio  frequency  (RF) 

discharges, gain much interest as processing techniques for the activation or the modification of polymer surfaces, even if they present 

some inconvenients.[5–7] Chen  et al.[8]  described not only the  activation but also the  deterioration of the polytetrafluoroethylene 

(PTFE) surface after its exposure to an RF plasma powered at 100W during 100 s. However, no or minor damage was noticed when the 

films were treated in the remote afterglow in the same plasma conditions. The damage of poly(vinyl chloride) surface treated in an RF 

discharge[9] or in DBD discharge[10] was evidenced.  

Many studies[11–13] underlined that a DBD treatment induced a surface oxidation of polyethylene (PE). Gilliam et al.[14] reported the 

treatment of LDPE in a low-temperature cascade arc plasma for a flow rate of 500–3000 sccm with an RF power set at 8W and a pressure 

of 50 mTorr. They underlined that a water contact angle (WCA) of 40° was reached (94° before treatment) after 20 s of argon plasma 

treatment while adding a reactive gas as oxygen resulted in greater damage of the LDPE surface. These authors demonstrated that the 

film was modified not only on the topmost surface layers but also in the bulk.

Plasma discharges, rich in active species (ions, electrons, and radicals), usually lead to a strong damage of the polymer surface. On the 

contrary, the post-discharge is much less aggressive in that most of the electrons and ions are neutralized upstream. As the radicals 

present a longer lifetime than those of the charged species, they can travel through the post-discharge and reach the polymer surface. 

Plasma surface modification of polymers is well known with an emphasis on the replacement of C–H bonds by polar, oxygen containing 

new groups. However, much less has been reported so far on polymer bulk modification induced by plasma and in particular on the 

oxygen diffusion toward the bulk. The modified depth has been determined to be typically comprised between 50 and 500 Å.[15] In the 

case of high density, PE and LDPE films modified in an Ar+ plasma discharge for exposure times varied from 0 to 400 s, with a power of 

1.7W, Svorcik et al.[16] showed by RBS method that the diffusion depth of the incorporated oxygen lay 25 nm beneath the sample 

surface in both polymer types after 250 s of treatment. 

Our article is focused on the activation of LDPE surfaces induced by the flowing post-discharge of an atmospheric RF plasma torch. The 

post-discharge is supposed to modify the surface and bulk of the polymer without damaging the topmost surface layer. The novelty of 

this work lies on the characterization of the oxygen diffusion depth by using angle-resolved (AR)-XPS and time-of-flight (ToF-SIMS) as 

complementary  techniques.  Other  results  obtained  from  WCA  measurements  and  Fourier  transform  infrared  (FTIR)  spectroscopy 

consolidate the conclusions provided by AR-XPS and ToF-SIMS.  

2. Experimental details 

2.1. Materials 

The LDPE polymer films used for this study were provided by PackOplast. They were 37% crystalline and presented a thickness of 40 

μm. For each series of experiments, three LDPE films were used so as to evaluate the uncertainties.  

2.2. Configuration: plasma torch and parameter conditions 

The polymer was treated using an AtomfloTM-250D plasma source from SurfX Technologies LLC.[7,17] The source was connected to a 

gas  supply  and  an  RF  power  generator  with  a  matching  network  operating  at  27.12  MHz.  According  to  the  specifications  of  the 

manufacturer, the power could be tuned between 60 and 90 W, the carrier gas could only be argon for flow rates ranging between 20 

and 40 L.min–1, whereas the reactive gas could only be oxygen for flow rate comprised between 0 and 25 mL.min–1. In our case, the 

argon flow rate was fixed at 30 L.min–1 for all the experiments. The treatment was achieved with a source-to-substrate distance (gap) 

of 9 mm.  

2.3. Water contact angle measurements 

The wettability modifications of the polymer surfaces were followed by dynamic WCA measurements by means of a Krüss DSA 100 

(Drop  Shape  Analysis  system,  Krüss  Gmbh,  Germany).  These  measurements  were  performed  in  an  air-conditioned  room,  and  the

working liquid was milli-Q water. Advancing and receding  angles were measured by  depositing a drop of 5 μL on the surface,  then 

increasing its volume to 15 μL, finally decreasing it. The reported advancing WCA was the maximum angles observed during the drop 

growth. The values of the receding WCA were those measured just before the contact surface reduction, i.e., the last measurements 

(from 5 to 7) before the distortion of the drop. Each advancing WCA presented in this article is an average of over five drops deposited, 

with a maximum error estimated to 3°.  

2.4. SEM 

Scanning electron microscopy was performed using a 200 CX Jeol microscope at 200 kV. As the samples were insulating materials, a thin 

layer (~10 nm) of gold was deposited onto their surface in order to compensate the charge effect. 

2.5. XPS 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed with a PHI 5600 photoelectron spectrometer system with a Mg Kα 

X-ray source (1253.6 eV) operating at 300W. For each spectrum, 10 accumulations were acquired, and the pass energies were 93.90 eV 

for the wide spectra and 23.5 eV for high resolution spectra. All spectra were referenced to the C 1s peak of the carbon atom at 285.0 

eV. The detection angle with respect to the surface was 45°. The surface analysis was carried out directly after the plasma treatment. 

High resolution XPS analyses were performed on the C 1s peak. The elemental composition was calculated after removal of a Shirley 

background and using the sensitivity coefficients provided by the manufacturer’s handbook: SC=0.205 and SO=0.63.[18] The FWHM was 

set to 1.5 eV for all spectra components. For the AR-XPS measurements, the detection angle with respect to the surface was varied for 

the following several values: 18°, 25°, 35°, 45°, 55°, 65°, 75°, 85°, and 90°. The angular acceptance and the number of angular channels 

were 60° and 120°, respectively. The distance between two lines was 5°. The data were acquired with the AugerScan software (RBD 

Instruments, Incorporation, USA) and the peak fittings were achieved with the Casa XPS software (Casa Software Ltd, USA).  

2.6. Fourier transform infrared in attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy 

The composition changes of the polymer surfaces were analyzed by ATR infrared spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra were determined by 

means  of  a  Nicolet  5700  FTIR  spectrometer  (Thermo  Electron  Corporation,  MA,  USA)  equipped  with  an  MCT  (mercury  cadmium 

telluride) detector cooled by liquid nitrogen, using a diamond/zinc selenide crystal. To ensure reproducible contact between the crystal 

faces and the polymer, the same pressure was applied to the crystal holder by means of a calibrated torque screw driver. Sixty-four 

scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1 were carried out for the untreated and each one of the plasma-treated samples. 

The infrared beam, in ATR spectroscopy, passes through the ATR crystal and penetrates the sample as an evanescent wave. According 

to [19,20], the penetration depth of the ketone CO stretching vibration (between 1720 and 1740cm–1) can be estimated at 1180 nm. 

The peak fitting was realized with the PeakFit software (Systat Software, Inc., IL, USA).

2.7. ToF-SIMS 

Depth profiling experiments were accomplished with a ToF-SIMS IV instrument from ION-TOF GmbH (Münster, Germany) equipped 

with two ion guns for analysis and etching. The analysis was performed using a pulsed 15 keV Ga+ ion gun, whereas the etching was 

achieved using Cs+ ions at the energy of 750 eV. 

The analysis was rastered over a 61.5 × 61.5 μm2 area centered inside the etching crater rastered over a 300 × 300 μm2 area. The incident 

angle  for  both  beams  was  45°.  A  non-interlaced  mode  was  used  in  order  to  limit  the  Ga+  influence  and  consequently,  to  reduce 

significantly the ion-induced damage. SIMS depth profiles were performed exclusively in negative ion polarity. An electron flood gun 

was used for charge compensation during all depth profiles. The spectrum normalization, achieved for all the results presented in this 

work, refers to the normalization of each spectrum in the depth profile to its own total secondary ion intensity in the m/z = 0–60 range 

for  the  negative  ion  mode.  This  normalization  method  was  used  to  facilitate  the  measurement  of  sputtering  rates  from  the  depth 

profiles. 

Because of its too large thickness (40 μm), sputtering an entire LDPE film would require too much time for evaluating the etching depth 

related to the etching time. In addition, for specific experimental conditions (Cs+ energy, current, and raster size), the heterogeneous 

crater resulting from the erosion makes the  depth measurement almost impossible  by  profilometry technique. As an alternative, a 

thinner LDPE film was achieved by using polymer granules, from INEOS-Belgium, with a density of 0,933 g.cm–3 and a molecular weight 

of 240 000 g.mol–1. They were ground to obtain a powder of LDPE, which was dissolved in hot (about 150 °C) decalin (99%, Sigma–

Aldrich) for 3 h. Then, the solution was deposited on a clean Si(100) for the spin coating process. By varying polymer concentration, spin 

speed and temperature, the thickness of the polymer films could be controlled to obtain thin LDPE film. The LDPE layer thickness was 

estimated  simply  by  scratching  the  layer  and  measuring  the  step  height  with  a  profilometer.  An  average  thickness  of  120nm  was 

measured by repeating this procedure several times. This film was then sputtered and analyzed by ToF-SIMS. The sputtering yield was 

calculated on the basis of the fluence of the Cs+ ions (3.0 × 1017 ions cm–2) and the sputtering time. The etching rate was estimated to 

82 Å.min–1, hence permitting the estimation of the oxygen diffusion into the treated LDPE. 

2.8. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) 

Optical emission spectroscopy was performed with a SpectraPro® 2500i from Acton research, Princeton instruments, Acton MA, USA 

equipped with a CCD camera (Princeton digital camera with 400 × 1340 pixels). For any OES measurement presented in this article, an 

LDPE sample was always placed under the plasma torch to a distance of 9mm, and the optical fiber was placed perpendicularly to the 

plasma torch and the sample. The data were collected with the software WinSpect32 (Princeton instruments, Acton MA, USA). A total 

of 1800 grooves/mm grating blazed at 500 nm (linear dispersion of 0.846mm at a wavelength of 579 nm) was employed to acquire 

spectra in the visible/near infrared range. The exposure time was fixed to 25ms, and 50 accumulations were achieved for each spectrum 

acquired.

3. Results 

3.1. Discharge treatment versus post-discharge treatment 

In order to evidence the advantage of using a post-discharge rather than other plasma sources, the treatment of LDPE was also achieved 

in a DBD under similar conditions (60W of power, 30 s of treatment, atmospheric pressure, circular electrodes with 40mm of diameter 

and  alumina  dielectric  with  2mm  of  thickness).  Figure  1  shows  (a)  SEM  micrographs  of  untreated  LDPE,  (b)  LDPE  treated  by  post-

discharge, and (c) LDPE treated  by DBD. The first image (a) is dominated by irregular protrusions  on the surface, which can also be 

observed on the image of the film treated by the plasma torch (b), thus evidencing that the plasma treatment did not induce a significant 

modification  or  strong  damage  of  the  LDPE  surface.  On  the  contrary,  the  topography  of  the  image  (c)  shows  the  appearance  of 

microscale protrusions due to a strong surface etching, attributed to the DBD. A similar behavior was observed when the PE film surface 

was modified by DBD in the air.[11] 

Figure 1. SEM micrographs of (a) untreated LDPE; (b) LDPE treated 60 s in the post-discharge; and (c) LDPE treated 30 s by DBD. 

3.2. Wettability and morphology of the surface 

As expected from the state of art [12], the plasma torch treatment causes a decrease in the hydrophobic character of the LDPE films, 

the films treated by Ar–O2 plasma being even more hydrophilic. Figure 2a illustrates the variation of the advancing WCAs of the LDPE 

films versus the treatment time in the range of 0–300 s for several plasma powers. It can be observed that the contact angle of the 

untreated LPDE sample (94.2°) decreases after an Ar or Ar-O2 post-discharge treatment. For an exposure of 30 s to the Ar post-discharge 

powered at 60 W, the contact angle decreases from 94° to 56° (Fig. 2a) instead of 47° for a sample treated under plasma containing 

oxygen (25 mL.min–1) (Fig. 2b). For a treatment time of 30 s, the results of WCA confirm that a saturation of the hydrophilic groups is 

reached on the LDPE surface.  Comparable  behaviors were observed for LDPE treated with  other  plasma configurations and  plasma 

gases.[21–24] Similar contact angles (i.e., 45°–60°) were reported for high density polyethylene (HDPE) treated with a DBD operating in 

air.[12] Figure 2b shows also a progressive increase in the hydrophilic character of the surface for treatment times higher than 30 s. The 

presence of oxygen mixed with the carrier gas allows a decrease in the WCA of at least 10°, whatever the value of the O2 flow rate 

(5, 15, or 25 mL.min–1).

and (b) the treatment time with different oxygen flow rates at 60W of plasma power. 

3.3. Modification of the outermost LDPE surface 

The modification of the surface chemistry was investigated by XPS. The wide XPS spectrum of native LDPE surface shows an O 1s peak 

(4.7%)  revealing  a  slight  oxidation  of  the  surface  due  to  the  manufacturing  process  of  LDPE.  An  increase  in  the  oxygen  surface 

concentration is detected on the spectrum of the treated film. 

Figure 3a,b,d illustrates the chemical composition ratio O/C of the top surface of LDPE with different treatment times, plasma powers, 

and oxygen flow rates. The increase of the O/C ratio indicates that more oxygen is grafted on the surface of the film with the increasing 

time of treatment (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b shows that the O/C ratio increases slowly with the increasing power. This increase is not in linear 

dependence with the cosine of static WCA, as shown in Fig. 3c. Vandencasteele et al.[25] showed the linear dependence between the 

cosine of WCA and the percentage of fluorine detected on the PTFE surface. The nonlinearity, observed in our case, could be explained 

by an oxygen diffusion toward the bulk, because the analysis depth of the XPS is around 5–10nm or by a smooth etching process that 

occurs on the surface of the polymer. Figure 3d shows the increase in the O/C ratio with as a function of the oxygen flow rate. This 

increase may come from an increase in the oxygen concentration onto the surface and in particular in the bulk close to the topmost 

surface layers.

WCA in terms of O/C ratio for different plasma powers; and

3.4. Chemical and structural modifications of the bulk 

Plasma surface modifications are confined only to a few tens of nanometers below the surface. FTIR spectroscopy in ATR mode is among 

the  methods  that  can  be  used  to  analyze  the  bulk,  i.e.,  few  hundreds  of  nanometers.[26]  The  spectra  are  normalized  with  the 

hydrocarbon stretching vibration line at 2916 cm–1 to compare the intensities of these lines with the spectra of different samples. Band 

assignments (taken from literature) are listed in Table 1. 

Table 1. Fourier transform infrared spectral mode assignment for low density polyethylene[11,25,26] 

Figure 4 shows the FTIR spectra of the untreated and plasma-treated LDPE. The absorption peaks at 2916 (no. 7), 2848 (no. 6), 1472 and 

1464  (no.  3)  cm–1  are  attributed  to  the  methylene  asymmetry  stretch  vibration,  methylene  symmetry  stretch  vibration,  methylene 

symmetry rocking vibration, and methylene asymmetry changing angle vibration, respectively (cf. Table 1).

3 between 1500 and 1400cm–1; (c) around 1780-1600 cm–1; and (d) the peak fitting of peaks 4 and 5 (d). 

Because of treatment, an additional peak (Figs. 4c,d) appears at 1737 cm–1, which corresponds to the C O (no. 5) stretching vibration, 

and the band at 1640 cm–1 corresponds to the COO (no. 4) asymmetrical stretching. For all samples, a weak shoulder is observed in the 

range 1350–1300 cm–1, which can be attributed to COO– (no. 2). The ν(O–H) vibrations are observed at 3400 cm–1 (no. 8) related to 

hydroxyl,  carboxyl,  and  peroxide  groups,  and  the  ν(C–O)  lines  are  observed  at  1090  cm–1  (no  .1),  which  can  be  interpreted  as  the 

appearance of hydroxyl, carboxyl, ether, ester, and peroxide groups. 

The  peak  fitting  of  the  FTIR  spectrum  between  1500  and  1400  cm–1  (Fig.  4b)  shows  two  additional  peaks  at  1454  and  1440  cm–1, 

corresponding to carbonyl groups (aldehyde or ketone). The C–OH and C O functional groups are generated on the LDPE surface, which 

was also confirmed by the XPS results. 

The  effects  of  the  treatment  time,  plasma  power,  and  oxygen  flow  rate  on  the  surface/bulk  polymer  oxidation  are  compared  by 

evaluating the integrated area of the peak at 1737 cm–1. This peak can reveal an in-depth oxidation profile because the penetration 

depth of the ketone vibration C O at 1737 cm–1 is 1180 nm. The variations of the integrated area of this C O peak are therefore depicted 

in Fig. 5 in terms of the plasma parameters (treatment time, power, and oxygen flow rate).

The integrated area of the C O vibration increases with the treatment  time and reaches a plateau after 60 s of treatment (Fig. 5a). 

However, this peak increases linearly with the power or the oxygen flow rate, as introduced in Fig. 5b,c, thus suggesting a significant 

oxygen diffusion into the bulk. The C O vibration intensity variations complement the results of the O/C ratio calculated from the XPS 

analysis,  because  the  analysis  depth  of  the  ATR-FTIR  can  reach  ~1  μm,  whereas  it  is  only  ~5–10nm  in  the  case  of  XPS.  The  oxygen 

diffusion through the bulk is discussed in the next section in order to estimate as accurately as possible its penetration depth and the 

underlying mechanisms. 

Figure 5. Variation of the integrated area of the peak C O at 1737 cm–1, taken from FTIR analysis, as a function of (a) the treatment time; (b) the 

plasma power; and (c) the oxygen flow rate. The conditions of treatment are the same of those on Fig. 3a,b,d. 

3.5. Study of the oxygen diffusion by ToF-SIMS 

The diffusion of oxygen into the LDPE surface during the post-discharge treatment was studied by ToF-SIMS depth profiling. 

Polyatomic projectiles such as C60

+ are widely used to perform depth profiling of organic layers. However, the sputtering of a polymer 

surface by C60

+ ions is challenging as it can be crosslinked during the analysis. In this case, the ion signal recorded during the erosion 

drops is mostly because of cross-linking reactions, involving the formation of free radicals under the ion bombardment with a deposition 

of carbon into the matrix of the polymer.[27] 

For these reasons, ToF-SIMS depth profiling was achieved with Cs+ ions rather than C60

+ or even Ar+ ions. The Cs+ ions are commonly 

used to achieve the elemental depth profiling of metal and semiconductor layers. Although less common, the feasibility of Cs+ ions for 

depth profiling polymers has been recently demonstrated.[28,29] It is thought that the chemical reactivity of caesium plays a dominant 

role. The caesium implantation during depth profiling strongly enhances the negative ionization of the sputtered ions. Moreover, the 

implanted caesium prevents the cross-linking reactions in the polymer. Figure 6 shows a typical negative ion spectrum of an LDPE film 

(i) treated by an Ar–O2 post-discharge powered at 60W during 30 s with ΦO2 = 25mL.min–1 and (ii) sputtered by Cs+ ions on a depth of 

10 nm. The m/z peaks at 13, 17, 27, 41, 43, and 45 relative to the CH–, OH–, C2H3

–, C2HO–, C2H3O–, and CHO2

– ions are characteristics of 

the modifications between untreated and treated LDPE samples.

The ToF-SIMS spectra presented in Fig. 7 were recorded for an untreated film and a film treated by a pure Ar post-discharge, powered 

at 60W for 30 s. In each case, the surface was probed 10 and 30 nm in-depth from the surface, after the sputtering induced by the Cs+ 

ions. The spectra of the untreated LDPE (Fig. 7a,b) show hydrocarbon peaks (as C2H2

–, C3H3

–, and others) that are so much elevated that 

most of them appear saturated while the oxygenated peaks are present at lower intensity. In comparison, these oxygenated peaks from 

the treated LDPE (Fig. 7c,d) are higher than in the previous case. For example, the intensity of the C2HO– ions at 10 nm increases from 

the untreated LDPE film (Fig. 7a) to the treated film (Fig. 7c), whereas the same intensity slightly decreases from Fig. 7b to Fig.7d for an 

in-depth of 40 nm. The increase in the intensity of oxygenated ions on a depth of 10 nm confirms the oxygen diffusion during the LDPE 

plasma  treatment.  The  high  intensity  of  CHO2

–  (carboxylic  ion)  in  both  spectra  of  the  treated  film  (Fig.  7c,d)  is  correlated  with  the 

increasing  intensity  of  the  carboxylic  groups  shown  on  the  FTIR  spectra  (Fig.  4c).  By  comparing  the  depth  profiling  curves  of  the 

untreated and treated films, the oxygen diffusion depth could be assessed thanks to the oxygenated fragments. 

For the sake of clarity and for the comparison with O/C XPS ratio, the overall oxygen content could be presented by the OH–/CH– ratio 

shown in Fig. 8 versus the sputtering depth. Figure 8 shows the OH–/CH– intensity values ratio as a function of the sputtering depth in 

the case of several LDPE films treated by an Ar post-discharge for (i) several treatment times (5, 10, 30, and 60 s), (ii) three plasma 

powers (60, 70, and 85 W), and (c) different oxygen flow rates (5, 15, and 25 mL.min–1). Whatever the graph, the OH–/CH– ratio increases 

rapidly in the first few nanometers of the profile and reaches a plateau for the films treated during a time shorter than 60 s (Fig. 8a) or 

with a power of 60W (Fig. 8b). In the other cases, the intensity increases rapidly to reach a maximum, immediately followed by a slow 

decrease until a plateau that is also reached by the other profiles.

treatment time; (b) the plasma power; and (c) the reactive oxygen flow. 

In Fig. 8a, the trend of the OH–/CH– ratio in the case of the untreated film is quite similar with those of the treated films (5, 10, and 30 

s). A different observation applies to Fig. 8b,c. Therefore, the OH–/CH– ratio measured in this case corresponds only to the background 

signal  already  observed  on  the  untreated  LDPE  films,  thus  indicating  that  a  low  oxygen  concentration  was  already  present  in  the 

untreated polymer. We notice that the oxygen diffuses slightly into the bulk if the films are treated in less than 60 s, or at a plasma 

power of 60 W, or with an oxygen flow rate as low as 5mL.min–1. However, for LDPE films treated during 60 s (Fig. 8a) or for a power of 

70 and 85W (Fig. 8b) or with oxygen flow rates higher than 5mL.min–1 (Fig. 8c), the OH–/CH– ratio for a sputtering depth comprised

between 0 and 40nm remains quite elevated, followed by gradual decrease down to the level reached on the other profiles after 20–

40nm  of  depth.  As  a  consequence,  if  the  conditions  time  >30  s,  power  >60  W,  O2  flow  rate  >5mL.min–1  are  respected,  the  oxygen 

diffusion  becomes  more  significant  into  the  bulk.  The  oxygen  penetration  depth,  and  thus  the  oxygen  gas  diffusion  effect,  can  be 

estimated to about 40nm below the surface. 

3.6. Study of the oxygen diffusion by AR-XPS 

Because the difference in the signal intensities is not clear for the situations where the films were treated on short times (5, 10, or 30 s) 

or for a weak plasma power (60 W), the oxygen penetration depth was estimated on the first in-depth nanometers by AR-XPS. For 

plasma-treated  polymer  samples,  the  modification  depth  is  typically  of  several  hundreds  of  angstrom  and  was  studied  by  surface-

sensitive techniques such as AR-XPS.[30] AR-XPS was performed on the untreated and several treated LDPE surfaces for different times. 

The estimated electron inelastic mean free path in the LDPE between 700 and 800 eV (kinetic energy of O1s) is comprised between 2.4 

and 2.6nm[31] Table 2 represents the calculated analysis depths (nanometer)[32,33] by considering that the intensity on the top surface 

(with TOA equal to 18°) is the reference intensity, because the XPS analyzer limits are 15° and 90°. 

The variation of the oxygen concentration in terms of the analysis depth (z) for the LDPE films treated at 60W and without adding oxygen 

gas is shown in Fig. 9. This figure clearly shows that the oxygen diffusion into the bulk of the polymer is dependent on the treatment 

time. The oxygen penetration depth is estimated to 8, 9, 10, and higher than 10 nm for the films treated during 5, 10, 30, and 60 s, 

respectively. We consider that there is no diffusion of oxygen atoms in the case of the untreated films, but the [O] remains almost low 

and constant whatever the TAO used. 

These results relative to the oxygen penetration depth are complementary to those obtained using ToF-SIMS profiles (Fig. 8a) and clearly 

evidence that oxygen diffuses into LDPE even on short treatment times (5, 10, or 30 s).

3.7. Plasma diagnostics 

Optical emission spectroscopy was used in order to determine the species that could be involved in the plasma surface modification 

depending on the oxygen flow rate. Figure 10 represents the intensities of the optical emission lines and bands of the following species 

as a function of the oxygen flow rate: O (777 nm), Ar (772 nm), N2 (337 nm), OH (310 nm), and NO (279 nm). The emission band of N2 is 

observed  whatever  the  oxygen  flow  rate,  hence  suggesting  a  reaction  between  the  flowing  gas  of  the  post-discharge  and  the 

surrounding air. As no N line was detected by OES, the production of the NO species could be explained according to the following 

reactions: 

In the post-discharge, N2 could be dissociated by colliding with Ar* species, as suggested in reaction (3) and evidenced in a previous 

work.[39] This reaction would result into the  production of  nitrogen atoms that could either recombine  with O atoms according to 

reaction (1) or – in a less extent– collide with O2 molecules according to reaction (2) to form the NO species. Another reaction responsible 

for the production of the NO species would be the recombination of N2(B3Πg) and O2 into NO molecules, as stated by reaction (4). In Fig. 

10, the increase in O and NO intensities as a function of the oxygen flow rate is consistent with these assumptions. 

The decrease in the OH band is balanced by the increase in the O singlet line suggesting a consumption of OH by hydrogen to produce 

atomic  oxygen  (Reaction  5),  even  if  the  species  (H  or  H2)  involving  in  this  reaction  which  is  taking  place  in  the  discharge  were  not 

detectable by OES. Figure 10 shows also the intensity of Ar singlet (14.7 eV of upper energy level) line slightly decreasing with the oxygen 

flow rate, because the molar fraction of the reactive gas is much smaller than the argon. 

4. Discussion 

The treatment of LDPE with an argon plasma torch induces a decrease in the WCA (40–50°) compared with the untreated film. The fact 

that the hydrophilicity of a treated film is better in the case of an Ar-O2 post-discharge (plateau = 40°) than for a pure Ar post-discharge 

(plateau = 50°), could be attributed to a slight etching of the surface topography in the first case. During the treatment, the free radical 

sites produced on the polymer surface can react with the surrounding polymer molecules and the plasma-phase species. Morajev et 

al.[40] reported that the main species present in the afterglow of argon and oxygen plasma torch were the ground-state O atoms, ozone, 

metastable molecules (O2(1Δg), O2(1Σg

+)), oxygen radicals (O(1D)), ions (OH–), free electrons, and UV radiations. The authors[40] asserted 

the production of 1.2±0.4*1017 cm–3 of ground-state oxygen atoms. Figure 10 confirms the presence of O atoms in this study and their 

increase with the oxygen flow rate. These species especially the oxygen atoms can react with the polymer chains to produce radicals on 

the polymer surface. 

The  collisions  between  the  excited  argon  metastable  species  and  the  O2  molecules  result  in  an  energy  transfer  to  the  reactive  gas 

molecules. The chemical reactions between a polymer surface and an argon post-discharge can involve the abstraction of hydrogen

atoms and the subsequent formation of carbon radicals.[41] An oxygen atom (10.74 eV of upper energy level) can easily abstract an H 

atom and therefore break a C–C bond (bond dissociation energies of C–H and C–C: 4.25 and 3.8 eV, respectively). 

Even if the emission of the NO species remains low whatever the oxygen flow rate, it cannot be considered as negligible because some 

nitrogen functions ([N1s] ~ 1.5% for TOA = 15° only) were grafted onto the LDPE surface, as explained in the literature.[42] This proves 

that the nitrogen grafting concerns the first layer of the film and probably does not diffuse deeper as the oxygen. In the case of a PTFE 

treatment  with  a  plasma  torch  supplied  in  helium,  Dufour[43]  et  al.  found  no  interaction  between  the  post-discharge  and  the 

surrounding air provided a gap lower than 2 mm. 

The increase in the hydrophilicity and in the O/C ratio of the LDPE films plotted in Figs. 2 and 3 as a function of the oxygen flow rate, 

the treatment time, and the plasma power may result from the increase in the atomic oxygen concentration in the post-discharge. Once 

the surface reached the plateau, this hydrophilicity is no more enhanced by increasing the treatment time, the RF power, or the O2 flow 

rate. A similar effect was observed on PET, even if in that case, the initial situation was characterized by an enrichment of oxygen in the 

topmost surface layers.[44] In our work, the surface of the films starts to be saturated in oxygenated groups either for a long treatment 

time or with a high power or with an elevated oxygen flow rate. This surface saturation, evidenced by a WCA and O/C ratio results, is 

gradually followed by oxygen diffusion as a function of the treatment time. The AR-XPS and ToF-SIMS measurements shown in Figs. 8 

and 9 are complementary and assess a diffusion of oxygen on a depth comprised between 2 and 40 nm, depending  on the plasma 

conditions. 

The following steps, from the first microseconds to the end of the treatment, can be summarized as presented in Fig. 11: the activation 

of the surface by oxygen atoms, the surface saturation, and the oxygen diffusion. On the one hand, as the hydrophilicity of the surface 

reaches a plateau (50° or 40° in an Ar or in an Ar-O2 post-discharge), the top surface (first layer of LDPE) could be saturated after 30 s of 

treatment by oxygen groups until the oxygen atoms diffuse into the bulk to reach the second monolayer (a). On the other hand, there 

is no evidence, by technical surface analysis, that oxygen atoms saturate the first monolayer of the LDPE surface. This suggests also that 

oxygen atoms could diffuse toward the monolayers from the first microseconds of the plasma treatment (b). This behavior needs more 

critical investigation because a smooth etching process could occur during the plasma treatment. The analysis of the first monolayer of 

a treated LDPE and the smooth etching process is intended in the framework of a future study.

The variation of the oxygen penetration depth in terms of the plasma parameters is represented in Fig. 12. For a film treated with a 

pure Ar post-discharge (plasma power = 60W) during 60 s, this depth could be evaluated to about 27nm (Fig. 12a), whereas with an Ar-

O2 post-discharge (oxygen flow rate = 25mL.min–1) during 30 s, this depth could be evaluated to 40nm (Fig. 12c). The modification depth 

can be estimated between 10 and 40nm depending on the plasma parameters and the nature of the LDPE polymer. For instance, a spin-

coated HDPE deposited on silicon substrate, treated 2000 s at low pressure in Ar plasma,[45] presents a modification depth turning 

around 50nm below the surface. Because LDPE presents more ramifications in its structure than HDPE, the chains are less cross-linked, 

hence, a lower intensity of the Van der Waals intermolecular forces. This nature and the fact that the LDPE is more amorphous (63%) 

permits the oxygen species to penetrate deeper in the bulk of the LDPE after tens of seconds of the plasma treatment. The ToF-SIMS 

results clearly showed that, compared with the untreated PE films, the plasma treatment induced an increase in the OH–/CH– ratio, 

which is very consistent with the XPS and FTIR results.

terms  of  (a)  the  treatment  time  (s);  (b)  the  plasma 

power (W) without oxygen gas for a treatment time 

of 30 s; and (c) the oxygen flow rate for a treatment 

time of 30 s and a power of 60 W. 

5. Conclusion 

This article describes the oxygen diffusion into LDPE films induced either by an Ar or an Ar-O2 post-discharge. The wettability of the 

surface film reaches a plateau (around 50°) when the treatment time is equal to 120 s and a plateau (around 40°) when the oxygen flow 

rate is higher than 5mL.min–1. This plateau, suggesting a saturation of the oxygen content on the surface, is  followed by an oxygen 

diffusion toward the bulk. The oxygen diffusion was also confirmed by FTIR analysis. On the basis of the ToF-SIMS profiles and the AR-

XPS measurements, the oxygen depth penetration was estimated from 1 to 40 nm, depending on the plasma parameters. The atomic 

oxygen and NO  species  detected by OES are the main reactive species  that could be  responsible for the surface activation and the 

oxygen diffusion.
