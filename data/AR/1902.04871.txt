ABSTRACT
The largest magnetic storm in solar cycle 24 was caused by a fast coronal mass ejection
(CME) that was related to a small C9.1 ﬂare that occurred on 15 March 2015 in solar
active region (AR) NOAA 12297. The purpose of this study is to understand the
onset mechanism of the geo-eﬀective huge solar eruption. We focused on the C2.4
ﬂare that occurred prior to the C9.1 ﬂare of the ﬁlament eruption. The magnetic ﬁeld
structure in the AR was complicated: there were several ﬁlaments including the one
that erupted and caused the CME. We hence carefully investigated the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld, brightenings observed in the solar atmosphere, and the three-dimensional
coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolated from nonlinear force-free ﬁeld modeling, using data
from Hinode and Solar Dynamics Observatory. We found three intriguing points :
(1) There was a compact but noticeably highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld structure that
is represented by a small ﬁlament in the C2.4 ﬂaring region, where a tiny precursor
brightening was observed before the C2.4 ﬂare. (2) The C2.4 ﬂaring region is located in
the vicinity of a foot point of the closed ﬁeld that prohibits the ﬁlament from erupting.
(3) The ﬁlament shows a sudden eruption after the C2.4 ﬂare and accompanying small
ﬁlament eruption. From our analysis, we suggest that a small magnetic disturbance
that was represented by the tiny precursor brightening at the time of the C2.4 ﬂare is
related to the trigger of the huge ﬁlament eruption.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar eruptions, such as ﬂares, coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), and ﬁlament eruptions, are
the biggest explosions in the solar system. They
are driven by magnetic energy stored in the
solar corona. Sunspot evolution and/or pho-
tospheric motions often form a twisted mag-
netic ﬂux rope, which erupts into interplane-
tary space with a ﬂare and CME. The mag-
netic ﬂux rope is sometimes represented by a
ﬁlament (e.g. Labrosse et al. 2010; Mackay et
al. 2010), which is dense and cool plasma resid-
ing in the hot corona. Recent high resolution
Hα observations show the twisted structure of
ﬂux ropes (e.g. Wang et al. 2015; Xue et al.
2016). The magnetic ﬂux rope can disturb the
space environment around the Earth when it
reaches the Earth having a south-oriented mag-
netic ﬁeld. A CME, which contains the mag-
netic ﬂux rope, reaches the Earth within 3-4
days, but it can take approximately 14 hours
at the shortest (Knipp et al. 2018). Therefore,
it is important to understand the onset mecha-
nism(s) of solar ﬂux rope eruption not only from
the solar physics perspective but also for space
weather forecast.

There are many observational and numerical
studies that attempt to reveal the onset mech-
anism(s) of solar ﬂux rope eruptions. For in-
stance, several models are proposed on the ba-
sis of ideal or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) models. Those models emphasize dif-
ferent aspects of the mechanism of solar erup-
tions: formation of magnetic ﬂux rope through
magnetic reconnection and evolution of the ﬂux
rope to eruption by the MHD instability. The
torus instability (e.g. Bateman 1978; Kliem &
T¨or¨ok 2006; T¨or¨ok, & Kliem 2007; D´emoulin &
Aulanier 2010; Olmedo, & Zhang 2010; Kliem et

al. 2014), helical kink instability (e.g. Gerrard
et al. 2001; T¨or¨ok et al. 2004; Fan & Gibson
2003; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005), tether-cutting re-
connection (Moore et al. 2001; Moore & Sterling
2006; Ishiguro, & Kusano 2017), and magnetic
break-out (Antiochos et al. 1999; Karpen et al.
2012) have been proposed as physical processes
leading to solar eruptions so far. However, it is
still not clear what triggers an initiation of the
solar ﬂux rope eruption.

It is statistically known that the incidence of
ﬂux rope eruption, which is represented by a
CME and/or ﬁlament eruption, correlates with
the X-ray peak ﬂux of the corresponding ﬂare
(Yashiro et al. 2006). Huge numbers of studies
relate the onset processes of ﬂux rope eruption
to large ﬂares (e.g. Inoue et al. 2015; Woods et
al. 2017; Bamba et al. 2013, 2017a,b; Zuccarello
et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2017). However, not only
large ﬂares but also small ﬂares relate to ﬂux
rope eruption (e.g. Louis et al. 2015; Dud´ık et
al. 2017), and even small ﬂares can have a geo-
eﬀective impact.

AR NOAA 12297 appeared on the southeast
solar limb on March 6, 2015, and produced large
numbers of ﬂares during its disk passage. The
largest ﬂare in terms of GOES1 soft X-ray class
was the X2.1 ﬂare on March 11. In the present
study, we focused on the sequential C2.4 and
C9.1 ﬂares that occurred on March 15, when
the AR was located at S22◦ W25◦. The C-class
ﬂares seem to relate to a fast CME that became
one of the causes of the largest magnetic storm
so far during solar cycle 24, which occurred on
March 17, 2015, with a minimum Dst index of
-223 nT (e.g., Liu et al. 2015; Kataoka et al.
2015).

The Role of a Tiny Brightening for Huge Geo-effective Solar Eruption

In this study, we aim to answer the question:
why such a huge solar eruption occurred asso-
ciated with a small C-class ﬂare? In order to
answer the question, we analyzed the dynam-
ics of the ﬁlament before and after its eruption
using extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images. More-
over, we investigated the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld structures close to a foot point of the closed
ﬁeld that prohibited the ﬁlament erupting. We
compared the results from the data analysis
with the extrapolated three-dimensional coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld structures obtained from a
nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model. As
a result, we identiﬁed a tiny brightening that
played an important role in triggering the huge
geo-eﬀective ﬁlament eruption.

The paper is organized in the following man-
ner. We ﬁrst review the C-class ﬂares and
source AR, which we focused on in this study,
and describe the data sets, analysis methods,
and the NLFFF modeling in Section 2. Then
we report the results from the data analysis in
Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the onset pro-
cess of the huge ﬁlament eruption by comparing
the analysis results and the NLFFF modeling.
Finally, we summarize the present study in Sec-
tion 5.

2. DATA ANALYSIS AND MODELING

We used Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO;
Pesnell et al. 2012) data to investigate the
temporal changes of the erupting ﬁlament and
surrounding global features in the photosphere
and chromosphere and to extrapolate three-
dimensional coronal magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover,
we analyzed Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007) data to
precisely investigate the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld and evolution of chromospheric brighten-
ings.

2.1. Solar Dynamics Observatory

We employed data obtained by SDO to inves-
tigate the global structure containing multiple
ﬁlament channels around the AR. The Atmo-

spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) images the solar atmosphere in 10 wave-
lengths. The spatial sampling and spatial res-
olution were 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel and 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively.
We analyzed AIA/304 ˚A(He II line) and 93
˚A(Fe XII and Fe XXIV lines) images 2. The
former is sensitive to emission from the chro-
mosphere and transition region (log T ∼ 4.7)
and the latter is sensitive to the corona and hot
ﬂare plasma (log T ∼ 6.2, 7.3). The data cover-
age in our analysis was from 18 UT on March 14
to 06 UT on March 15, 2015, and the cadence
was 12 seconds. AIA images were calibrated by
applying the aia prep procedure of the Solar
Soft-Ware (SSW) package, and we investigated
the topological change of the erupting ﬁlament.
In addition, we analyzed vector magne-
tograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) in the
Fe I line (6173 ˚A). The vector magnetograms
have been released as SHARP (Spaceweather
HMI Active Region Patch; Bobra et al. 2014)
data series 3, in which the magnetic ﬁeld has
been derived assuming the Milne-Eddington
atmosphere and remapped to a Lambert Cylin-
drical Equal-area (CEA) projection. The 180◦
ambiguity in the horizontal component was re-
solved using a minimum energy method (Met-
calf 1994). The spatial sampling and spatial res-
olution were 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel and 0.9(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively.
We used a single SHARP image taken at 00 UT
on March 15, 2015, for our NLFFF modeling
(see Section 2.3 for details). Moreover, we ex-
tracted an HMI vector magnetogram at 00 UT
on March 15 for a larger region than the SHARP
ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) around the AR in order to
extrapolate the three-dimensional (3D) coronal
magnetic ﬁeld (see 2.3 for details). We cut out
a region centered around 195◦ Carrington Lon-

gitude and 20◦ latitude south from the solar
equator. We ﬁrst converted the magnetic ﬁeld
vector data in CCD coordinates (Bx, By, Bz)
4 to those in the spherical coordinate system
(Br, Bθ, Bφ). Then we projected the local or-
thogonal vector components onto the 800 × 800
pixel CEA map 5 with 0.03◦ × 0.03◦ heliocentric
angle resolution at the map center.

2.2. Hinode

We analyzed chromospheric images obtained
by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT;
Tsuneta et al. 2008) in the Ca II H line (3968
˚A). The data covered 12 hours from 18 UT on
March 14 to 06 UT on March 15, 2015, with 1
minute cadence and a 183(cid:48)(cid:48) × 108(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV. Con-
tinuum images in G-band (CH I line, 4305 ˚A)
were also taken every 10 minutes with the same
FOV. The spatial sampling was 0.108(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel
by 2 × 2 summing and the spatial resolution
was approximately 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48) for both wavelengths.
We calibrated the Ca and G-band images by
dark-current subtraction and ﬂat ﬁelding us-
ing the fg prep procedure in the SSW pack-
age. Then we reduced spatial ﬂuctuations by
cross-correlating two consecutive images in the
respective wavelengths.

The Spectro-Polarimetor (SP; Lites et al.
2013) obtained the full polarization states
(Stokes-I, Q, U, and V) in the Fe I lines (6301.5
and 6302.5 ˚A) with a sampling of 21.6 m˚A.
The data were observed using the Fast Map-
ping mode observation,
in which the spatial
sampling was 0.32(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel and the spatial res-
olution was approximately 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48) along the slit.
The SP scanning was performed from 00:11 UT
to 00:43 UT on March 15, 2015, and covered on
FOV of 164(cid:48)(cid:48) × 164(cid:48)(cid:48). We calibrated the SP scan

data using the sp prep procedure in the SSW
package (Lites & Ichimoto 2013), and vector
magnetic ﬁelds were derived from the calibrated
Stokes proﬁles on the assumption of the Milne-
Eddington atmosphere adopting the inversion
code MIKSY (Yokoyama et al., private com-
munication). The 180◦ ambiguity was resolved
using the minimum-energy code “ME0” (Leka et
al. 2009a,b, 2012) based on the minimum energy
method of Metcalf (1994). Then we spatially
co-aligned the SP vector magnetogram and Ca-
line images by cross-correlating the Stokes-I and
G-band images. From the co-alignment images,
we investigated the spatial and temporal corre-
lation between chromospheric brightenings and
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld.

2.3. Nonlinear Force-Free Field Modeling

We brieﬂy review the modeling of the 3D coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld using an NLFFF approxima-
tion (e.g., Wiegelmann & Sakurai 2012). We
employ the MHD relaxation method developed
in Inoue et al. (2014); Inoue (2016). The bot-
tom boundary is ﬁxed with the vector magnetic
ﬁelds (Bx, By, Bz) in the photosphere, observed
at 00 UT on March 15, 2015, by SDO/HMI.
We then solve the MHD equations in 3D space
starting with a potential ﬁeld which is extrapo-
lated from the Bz component in the photosphere
(Sakurai 1982). Note that pressure and gravity
are neglected here because the low β approxima-
tion is well satisﬁed in the solar corona (Gary
2001). Therefore, we solve the MHD equations
simpliﬁed in the zero β approximation. The ba-
sic equations are as follows,

where ρ is plasma density, B is the magnetic
ﬂux density, v is the velocity, J is the electric
current density, and φ is a convenient potential
to remove errors derived from ∇ · B (Dedner
et al. 2002), respectively. The pseudo density
is assumed to be proportional to |B| in order
to ease the relaxation by equalizing the Alfven
speed in space. ν is a viscosity ﬁxed as 1.0 ×
10−3, and the coeﬃcients c2
p in Equation (5)
are also ﬁxed with the constant values, 0.04 and
0.1, respectively. The initial density condition
is given by ρ = |B| and velocity is set to zero in
all space. The resistivity is given by η = η0 +
η1|J×B||v|/|B| where η0 = 5.0×10−5 and η1 =
1.0×10−3 in non-dimensional units. The second
term is introduced to accelerate relaxation to
the force free ﬁeld, particularly in weak ﬁeld
regions. At the boundaries, all of velocities are
ﬁxed to zero and the magnetic ﬁelds are ﬁxed to
potential ﬁelds except at the bottom boundary.
Details are described in Inoue et al. (2014).

The numerical box covers 216 × 216 ×
151.2(M m3) which is given as 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.7
in non-dimensional units. The region is divided
into 300 × 300 × 210 grids which is a result of
the 2 × 2 binning process of the original vec-
tor magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere taken by
SDO/HMI.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Overview of the C-class Flares and

Filament Eruption

First, we review the evolution steps from the
C2.4 ﬂare to the huge ﬁlament eruption, using
SDO data. Figure 1 shows the GOES soft X-ray
light curve covering the time of the C2.4 and
C9.1 ﬂares. The onset time of the C2.4/C9.1
ﬂare was 00:34 UT/01:15 UT on March 15,
2015, as indicated by the vertical solid/broken
lines. There were multiple ﬁlament structures
close by AR 12297 as seen in the SDO/AIA 304
˚Aimage of Figure 2(a). The erupting ﬁlament
F1 and the other two ﬁlaments F2 and F3 are

all rooted in the AR. Panel (b) shows the ra-
dial component of the SDO/HMI magnetogram
with the same FOV as panel (a). The C9.1 ﬂare
occurred in association with the eruption of F1,
and was a long duration event (LDE), while the
preceding C2.4 ﬂare was a relatively impulsive
event as seen in Figure 1. The C2.4 ﬂare oc-
curred in the northern PIL of a satellite spot
(SS) which is highlighted by the white arrow in
panel (b).

The temporal variation of ﬁlaments F1, F2,
and F3 related to the C2.4 and C9.1 ﬂares is
shown in the AIA 304 ˚A images of Figure 3 and
Movie 16. Panel (a) is a snapshot before the
C2.4 ﬂare. There is a small ﬁlament in addi-
tion to the large ﬁlaments F1, F2, and F3 as
indicated by the white arrow. The small ﬁla-
ment exists on the PIL which is located in the
north of the SS in Figure 2(b). The ﬂare rib-
bons of the C2.4 ﬂare appear as indicated by
the black arrows in panel (b), and the southern
ribbon is located over the PIL where the small
ﬁlament is located. The small ﬁlament erupts
around 00:38 UT in association with the C2.4
ﬂare as illustrated by the blue arrow in panel
(c). Wang et al. (2016) investigated the de-
tailed temporal evolution of the small ﬁlament
eruption using AIA 304 ˚A and 171 ˚A images
and RHESSI7. According to their analysis, the
small ﬁlament eruption is composed of a hot X-
ray jet and surge-like eruption and is analogous
to the process proposed by Sterling et al. (2015).
We found that F1 is drastically disturbed from
00:40 UT and it erupted southwestward (panel
(d)) while the small ﬁlament eruption attenuate.
The two ﬂare ribbons of the C9.1 ﬂare gradu-
ally appeared from 01:12 UT corresponding to
the huge F1 eruption as indicated by the black
arrows in panel (e). The ribbons and post ﬂare

arcade remained for more than 6 hours as the
GOES soft X-ray light curve in Figure 1 gradu-
ally decayed. Incidentally, F3 dynamically rose
upward corresponding to the F1 eruption and
showed a helical loop structure as indicated by
the black arrow in panel (f), but it failed to
erupt. F2 stayed static and did not erupt with
the C2.4 or 9.1 ﬂares or the F1 eruption.

distribution of the angles in panel (d). Red and
blue indicate the shear angles in the range ±
180◦. The black lines and green cross show the
PIL and location of PB, which are the same
as in panel (c). Obviously there are highly
sheared ﬁelds (approximately 60◦ to 90◦ clock-
wise) along the ﬂaring PIL on which the precur-
sor brightening was seen.

3.2. Detailed Observation of the C2.4 Flare

3.3. Magnetic Topology Related to Erupting

It is inferred from the overview of the SDO
analysis in the previous section (Section 3.1)
that the onset of the C2.4, C9.1, and the huge
ﬁlament eruption is sequential. Hence we study
the details of the C2.4 ﬂare, that seems to be
related to the cause that triggers the sequential
ﬂares and eruption, using the Hinode data. Fig-
ure 4(a, b) are chromospheric images before and
just after the C2.4 ﬂare onset, respectively. A
tiny brightening that is labeled PB by the white
arrow in panel (a) is the last precursor brighten-
ing that was observed in the 20 minutes period
from 23:10 UT (i.e. from 24 minutes before the
C2.4 ﬂare onset). Then the initial ﬂare ribbons
of the C2.4 ﬂare appeared as in panel (b); the
separated two positive ribbons are labeled PR1
and PR2, and the negative ribbon is labeled NR.
The ribbons are also seen in Figure 3(b) but
PR1 and NR are now clearly identiﬁed thanks
to the high spatial resolution of Hinode. The
red cross in panel (b) marks the location of PB
in panel (a). The ribbons PR1, PR2, and NR
were distributed with a circular shape on both
sides of the location where PB was observed.

The background grayscale in panel (c) indi-
cates the opposite polarities in the radial com-
ponent of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The
green lines show the PILs and white/black ar-
rows indicate the ﬁeld strength and orientation
of the horizontal magnetic ﬁelds. PB was seen
on the PIL located in the north of the SS, and
the location is marked by the red cross. We
calculated the magnetic shear angles relative to
the potential ﬁeld in this region and show the

Filament and C2.4 Flare

We derived the coronal magnetic ﬁeld using
the NLFFF extrapolation around the C2.4 ﬂar-
ing PIL, where the precursor brightening was
seen and magnetic shear was strong as seen in
Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld, the distribution of the electric current den-
sity |J |, and the magnetic twist TW estimated
from 1/4π (cid:82) ∇ × (cid:126)B · (cid:126)B/| (cid:126)B2|dl, where dl is a line
element. There is locally but strongly twisted
ﬁeld (green tubes), which is located north of the
SS and is rooted at both sides of the C2.4 ﬂar-
ing PIL inside the white rectangle in panel (a).
Strong current concentrates on the C2.4 ﬂaring
region, although the electric current over the
major PIL in the following spot dominates on
the whole region, as can be seen in panel (b).
The magnetic twist in the C2.4 ﬂaring region,
marked by the white rectangles in panels (a, b),
is seen in panels (c-1, c-2). The red colored
strong twist (TW ∼ 1.0) is distributed on both
sides of the C2.4 ﬂaring PIL, i.e., at the foot
points of the local twisted magnetic ﬁeld (green
tubes). Therefore, the northern PIL of the SS
has locally highly twisted ﬁeld with strong elec-
tric currents, and was more likely to ﬂare.

We next investigated the relationship between
the C2.4 ﬂaring site and C9.1 erupting ﬁlament
F1 on large-scales. The green tubes in Fig-
ure 6 show the closed magnetic ﬁeld overly-
ing F1. The background images are AIA 304
˚A (panel a) and the radial component of the
SHARP vector magnetogram in panel (b), re-
spectively. The three ﬁlament structures that

The Role of a Tiny Brightening for Huge Geo-effective Solar Eruption

are labeled in Figures 2 and 3 are marked by
the white arrows in panel (a). The green-colored
closed ﬁeld lines are overlying F1, i.e., the closed
ﬁelds prohibit F1 from erupting. Panel (c) is a
bird’s-eye view from the direction of the blue
arrow in panel (b).
It shows that one side of
the foot points of the closed ﬁelds are rooted in
the positive polarity region to the north of the
C2.4 ﬂaring region. The foot point is close to
the highly twisted compact ﬁeld over the C2.4
ﬂaring PIL shown in Figure 5(a). The other
foot point of the closed ﬁelds is connected with
both the SS and the weak negative polarity re-
gion in the south of the AR. Moreover, we dis-
played in panel (d) a vertical cross-section of
the decay index n that is located on the dashed
line in panel (b). The decay index n is deﬁned
as n = −d ln | Bp,h | /d ln | z | (Kliem & T¨or¨ok
2006). Here, Bp,h and z are the horizontal com-
ponent of the potential magnetic ﬁeld calculated
from the observed Bz (radial component of HMI
SHARP data) and the height, respectively. Ob-
viously, only a part of the closed ﬁelds reaches
the isosurface of n = 1.5, which is indicated by
the black line in panel (d) and corresponds to
the critical value for the torus instability (e.g.
Zuccarello et al. 2015). This suggests that the
ﬁlament that is trapped by the closed ﬁeld is
stable with respect to the torus instability.

3.4. Behavior of the Erupting Filament

We investigated the temporal variation of the
erupting ﬁlament F1 through 24 hours to the
C9.1 eruption onset. Figure 7 shows time-slice
plots of F1 in SDO/AIA 193 ˚A. We cut the
erupting ﬁlament along the white vertical line
in panel (a), which is roughly along the green-
colored closed ﬁeld in Figure 6. The time-slice
plots along the line-cut in (a) are panels (b-1)
and (b-2), respectively.

Panel (b-1) shows 24 hours of the evolution
of F1. F1, which is marked by the white arrow,
gradually moves downward in the image (south-
ward in panel (a)) in the 12 hour period from 00

UT on March 14. Note that downward move-
ment in the image means movement away from
the AR on the Sun because the AR and ﬁla-
ments are located in the southwest hemisphere.
A bright feature around 12 UT on March 14 is
related to an eruption of F2 with a C2.6 ﬂare
(11:44 UT onset) followed by a ﬁrst CME (Wang
et al. 2016). According to the Hα observation in
Chandra et al. (2017), the ﬁlaments F1 and F3,
which are labeled in Figure 3(a) in the present
paper, were originally one huge ﬁlament. This
F2 eruption disturbed the huge ﬁlament, and
the huge ﬁlament appeared divided into F1 and
F3, as can be seen in Figure 3(a). The distur-
bances from F1 last until around 18:30 UT, then
F1 moves downward in a step-like motion as can
be seen in panel (b-1).

Panel (b-2) focus onto the time period from
20 UT on March 14 to 03 UT on March 15, i.e.,
from 4.5 hours before the C2.4 ﬂare onset to af-
ter the C9.1 eruption. The onset times of the
C2.4 and C9.1 ﬂares are indicated by the blue
and green vertical lines, respectively. The white
vertical broken lines indicate the start and end
times of the precursor brightening, which is la-
beled as PB in Figure 4. It is noteworthy that
F1 move downward very slowly but become un-
stable just after the PB was observed. The C2.4
ﬂare occurred following the PB and F1 distur-
bance, then F1 erupted.

4. DISCUSSION

The time series of observational facts derived

from our data analysis is summarized below.

1. The closed ﬁeld that roots the positive po-
larity region in the north of the SS holds
ﬁlament F1 while there is compact but
highly twisted ﬁeld over the north PIL of
the SS.

2. The tiny brightening PB appeared on the
north PIL of the SS, then the ﬁlament F1
is disturbed afterwards.

Bamba et al.

3. The C2.4 ﬂare, which shows circular
shaped ribbons, occurs and the small ﬁla-
ment that existed on the northern PIL of
SS erupts.

4. The ﬁlament F1 is drastically disturbed
and erupts. Huge C9.1 ﬂare ribbons are
observed in the south of the AR and grad-
ually enhance.

The F1 eruption related to the C9.1 event was
accompanied by a fast CME that caused the
largest magnetic storm in solar cycle 24. Here,
we discuss the onset process of the huge geo-
eﬀective solar eruption.

The torus instability is one candidate to ex-
plain an initiation of the CME. Note that, in
order to drive the instability, the axis of the
magnetic ﬂux needs to reach a region where the
decay index value satisﬁes n > 1.5 (Zuccarello
et al. 2016). Therefore, other driving processes
(e.g., kink instability, duble-arc sustainability
(Ishiguro, & Kusano 2017)) are also important
to push the ﬂux rope to a region where it be-
comes unstable to the torus instability. In our
NLFFF modeling result in Figure 6, the ﬂux
rope sustaining ﬁlament F1 is inferred to be
stable to the torus instability, at least, at 00
UT on March 15 because the green colored ﬁeld
lines strapping down the ﬂux rope pass through
a region where the decay index value satisﬁes
n ∼ 1.5. On the other hand, F1 gradually
rises upward as shown in Figure 7, which con-
verts to a quick ascension just after the C2.4
ﬂare. Therefore, the C2.4 ﬂare might accelerate
the instability of F1. Figure 6 shows that the
C2.4 ﬂare was observed in the region where the
closed ﬁeld lines in green, which strap down F1,
are rooted. Therefore the C2.4 ﬂare might play
a role in disturbing and initiating the eruption
of F1. Several studies (e.g. Olmedo, & Zhang
2010; Myers et al. 2015) reported that the crit-
ical decay index value strongly depends on the
shape or boundary state of a ﬂux rope, conse-
quently, the ﬂux rope becomes unstable to the

torus instability even though its axis does not
reach a region where n > 1.5 is satisﬁed. There-
fore, the C2.4 ﬂare might accelerate the torus
instability.

We further propose that the precursor bright-
ening (PB) that was seen just before the C2.4
ﬂare is possibly related to a trigger of the F1
eruption. This is inferred from the fact that the
precursor brightening PB was observed on the
C2.4 ﬂaring PIL located between the C2.4 ﬂare
ribbons, and become F1 was disturbed from just
after PB was observed (Figures 4 and 7). Thus,
it is inferred that a small-scale magnetic ﬁeld
disturbance caused the PB in Figure 4. This
disturbance triggered magnetic reconnection of
the locally twisted ﬁeld seen in Figure 5 and the
C2.4 ﬂare occurred in association with the small
ﬁlament eruption of Figure 3 (b) (e.g. Chen &
Shibata 2000; Green et al. 2011; Bamba et al.
2013; Sterling et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016).
From these results, we suggest that emerging
magnetic ﬂux (Chen & Shibata 2000) or mag-
netic ﬂux cancellation (Green et al. 2011) cause
the tiny precursor brightening PB. It is diﬃ-
cult to identify what magnetic disturbance is
suitable to cause the tiny brightening PB be-
cause the spatial scale is smaller than the spa-
tial resolution of SDO/HMI and AIA. However,
our analysis results support the scenario that
the sequential huge eruption started from a tiny
brightening at the foot point independent from
the C9.1 eruption.

5. SUMMARY

In this study, we aimed to understand the on-
set mechanism of the huge ﬁlament eruption
which caused the largest magnetic storm, the
so-called “St Patrick’s day storm”, in solar cycle
24. We focused on the C2.4 ﬂare that occurred
approximately 45 minutes prior to the C9.1 ﬂare
onset corresponding to the huge ﬁlament erup-
tion. Using Hinode/SOT, SDO/HMI and AIA,
and NLFFF modeling, we investigated the be-
havior of the erupting ﬁlament and characteris-

tics of the photospheric/coronal magnetic ﬁeld
and chromospheric brightening before/after the
C2.4 ﬂare.

We found a tiny precursor brightening that
was observed on the PIL at the C2.4 ﬂaring
site. There was highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld
structure locally in the region over the precur-
sor brightening which is seen as a small ﬁla-
ment. The C2.4 ﬂaring site, where the twisted
ﬁeld (i.e. the small ﬁlament) and the precur-
sor brightening were observed, was a foot point
of the closed magnetic ﬁeld that sustained the
erupting ﬁlament. From a comparison between
the observational results and NLFFF modeling,
it is suggested that the tiny precursor bright-
ening is the proxy of a small-scale magnetic
disturbance that triggered the sequential erup-
tion from the small ﬁlament to the ﬁlament that
caused the geomagnetic storm.

It would be no surprise if the erupting ﬁlament
had erupted at some point without any “trig-
ger”, because it gradually rose upward from at
least 24 hours before the C9.1 eruption onset.
However, the ﬁlament was stable with respect to
the torus mode at least until 00 UT on March
15, just before the C2.4 ﬂare onset according
to our NLFFF modeling. Our observational re-
sults showed us that the erupting ﬁlament is
destabilized after the precursor brightening was
observed, then it erupts subsequent to the C2.4
ﬂare and small ﬁlament eruption.

Therefore, in the present study, we suggest
that the tiny magnetic disturbance, which
caused the precursor brightening,
the C2.4
ﬂare, and accompanying small ﬁlament erup-
tion, destabilized the closed ﬁeld that prohib-
ited the ﬁlament F1 from erupting. This trig-
gers the huge ﬁlament eruption which was the
source of the largest magnetic storm in solar
cycle 24, the so-called “St Patrick’s day storm”.
