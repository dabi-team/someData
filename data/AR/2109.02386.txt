Abstract:-  Augmented  Reality,  or  simply  AR,  is  the 
incorporation  of  information  in  digital  format  that 
includes  live  footage  of  a  certain  user's  real-time 
environment.  Also  now,  various  universities  are  using 
Augmented  Reality.  Applying  the  technology  in  the 
education  sector  can  result  in  having  a  smart  campus. 
In line with that, this paper will discuss how Augmented 
Reality is being used now in different learning areas.

According to Rouse as cited in [1], Augmented Reality 
or  simply  AR  is  the  integration  of  information  in  digital 
time 
format  which 
environment  of  a  certain  user.  In  an  augmentation  of  live 
videos,  integrating  a  video  picture  to  digital  environment 
involves  identification  of  an  object  replicated  from  the 
physical  world  features and  will  be  captured  as any  format 
that  will  be  considered as  a  video  picture  which  will mean 
that  increasing  the  responsiveness  of  the  generated  video 
picture  to  the  state  needed  to  control  the  object  from  the 
physical world itself [2] In an augmented reality system, the 
integrated  digital  information  can  only  be  seen  using  a 
medium  like  phone  cameras  but  it  will  not  be  seen  in  the 
real  world.  These  digital  information  can  be  represented  in 
different forms like a stack of virtual cubes or manipulating 
a non-real object in many ways possible [3].  

Another kind of integration that Augmented Reality is 
normally  defined  for  is  it  can  indicate  a  supplemental 
information  to  a  user.  This  supplemental  information  are 
considered optional and may not affect the actual user of the 
system  itself.  The  method  being  used  by  an  Augmented 
Reality  System  to  provide  these  supplemental  information 
are  the  following:  Tracking  the  user's  point  of  view, 
Capturing  a  camera  field  of  perspective  and  Obtaining 
additional  data  in  the  field  of  perspective  captured  for  at 
least  one  object  [4].  One  perfect  example  of 
this 
supplemental  information  which  obtains  additional  data  in 
the field of perspective captured for at least one object is if 
the user’s interest is in vehicle, the system should present an 
augmented  reality  replica  of  a  vehicle  and  cover  the  user’s 
environment based on the point of interest [5].

AUGMENTED REALITY FOR EDUCATION 

(AR)  apps  have 

Augmented  Reality 

received 
increasing  attention  over  the  previous  two  decades.  In  the 
1990s, AR was first used for apps linked to pilot education 
as well as for training of Air Force [6]. AR generates fresh 
world  experiences  with  its  data  layering  over  3D  space, 
suggesting that  AR  should  be  embraced  over  the next  2–3 
years  to  give  fresh  possibilities  for  teaching,  learning, 
study,  or  creative  investigation  according  to  the  2011 
Horizon  Report  [7].  AR  uses  virtual  objects  or  data  that 
overlap physical objects or environments to create a mixed 
reality  in  which  virtual  objects  and  actual  environments 
coexist  in  a  meaningful  manner  to  increase  learning 
experiences.  Azuma  as  cited  by  [6],  stated  that  the 
mentioned virtual objects is appearing in coexistence as the 
same  space  as  the  objects  that  is  located  in the real  world. 
AR  is  now  a  common  technology  commonly  used  in 
instructional environments in the education sector [8].  

the  most  significant  factors  for 

AR  has  also  become  a  major  study  focus  in  latest 
years.  One  of 
the 
widespread use of AR technology is that it no longer needs 
costly  hardware  and  advanced  machinery  such  as  head 
mounted screens [6]. According to Chiang, Yang & Hwang 
as  cited  by  [6],  Augmented  Reality  is  widely  used  now  in 
the K-12 level in the education industry. Ferrer-Torregrosa 
et  al.,  (2015)  stated  that  Augmented  Reality  is  also  being 
used  now  by  different  universities.  The  application  of  the 
technology in the education sector can lead to have a smart 
campus. Smart campuses are designed to benefit professors 
and  students,  handle  the  resources  available  and  improve 
the experience of the users with proactive services [10].

As  highlighted  in  the  Horizon  report,  Augmented 
Reality (AR) is acknowledged as one of the most significant 
innovations in  greater and K-12  education  technology  [12]. 
Augmented  reality  is  gradually  becoming  integrated  as  an 
emerging  technology  in  the  region  of  inclusive  education 
that adapts learning in equal footing through exploration and 
experience  by  all  [13].  Johnson  (as  cited  by  Saltan,  2017) 
stated that AR is anticipated to be widely adopted in higher

education for two to three years and in K-12 for four to five 
years.  It  is  essential  to  explore  how  teachers  and  scientists 
incorporate  AR  into  teaching-learning  procedures  if  this  is 
the  present  state  of  the  art  for  the  use  of  AR  in  education. 
MUVEs and AR became visible in the early 2000s and their

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

Fig 1:- Overview of Research Methodology 

The  searching procedure  started  by  selecting the topic 
to be reviewed. In this case the topic is  Augmented Reality 
for  Education.  The  topic  selected  will  explore  the  different 
sectors  in  Education  that  is  using  Augmented  Reality  as  a 
tool  for  teaching  and  learning.  After  identifying  the  topic, 
the next step is to go to google scholar. In this part the study 
will be filtered depending on the importance of each study. 
Another  filter  that  needs  to  be  added  is  the  year  when  the 
publication  was  published.  It  is  very  safe  to  say  that  five 
years interval will still make a certain publication still valid. 
Once  the  filtering has  been  set, it is now  time  to  select the 
relevant  document  that  will  build  up  the  foundation  of  the 
review. After knowing the foundation and the outline where 
the documents will be discussed, the DOI will be used to be 
able  to  get  the  full  copy  of  the  documents.  Once  the  full 
study  has  been  acquired,  it  is  now  time  to  review  all 
documents.  During  the  review  process,  this  is  the  time  to 
filter  which  documents  is  needed  to  support  the  selected 
topic.  Take  down  notes  and  get  all  the  helpful  information 
for the citation. Once the important facts has been gathered 
and the studies has been filtered, it is now time to write the 
review.

Initially,  Arabic  language  teaching  can  no  longer 
depend  exclusively  on  traditional learning techniques  such 
as note-taking  and lecturing,  which are  still  predominantly 
preferred  among  Arabic  lecturers  as  Zainuddin  &  Sahrir 
(2016)  stated.  Early  evaluation  and  observation  by  the 
scientists  means  that  the  absence  of  usage  in  instructional 
digital  advancements  for  learning  as  well  as  teaching 
Arabic  has hindered  the  memorization  process  of  teaching 
Arabic  vocabulary  in  the  classroom.  Ismail  (as  cited  by

C.  Augmented Reality for ICT Education.  

In  instructional  environments,  computer  techniques 
were  implemented  and  made  learning  more  flexible  and 
intuitive.  Augmented  reality  (AR)  has  attracted  great 
government  attention  among  these  techniques  because  it 
offers  a  fresh  teaching  view  by  enabling  learners  to 
visualize  complicated  spatial  relationships  and  abstract 
ideas [22]. Research have shown that, owing to a number of 
factors,  many  Malaysian  non-technical  learners  have  low 
motivation  in  studying  ICT  courses,  such  as  absence  of 
teaching practice and efficient teaching apps. In the outlook 
of  such  issue,  the  research  teams  conducted  a  quasi-
experimental  analysis  to  examine  the  adverse  effect  of  a 
new  application  for  mobile  augmented  reality  learning 
(MARLA) on the motivation of learners to learn a topic of 
an ICT course at the university [23].  

The  analysis  showed  more  motivation  for  masculine 
learners  than  for  their  inverse  counterparts.  In  addition, 
there  was  an  impact  of  interaction  between  gender  and 
method  of  learning,  with  male  learners  achieving  distinct 
motivation levels depending on technique of learning. Such 
a mobile learning instrument may possibly be used to assist 
non-technical  undergraduates  learn  more  in  a  motivated 
manner,  but  their  achievement  will  depend  on  adequate 
planning  and  execution  by  considering  the  demographic 
background of the learners.  

Another  study  under  the  ICT  education  sector  has  a 
goal  in  exploring  if  the  integration  of  AR  methods  would 
facilitate  application  for  changing  the  style  as  well  as 
analyzing  a  distinct  outcome  in  educating  the  learners 
which uses blended learning approach based on online and 
AR  [24].  It  was  found  that  technology  instructional

D.  Augmented Reality for Science Education.  

Education Professionals must tackle several problems 
intrinsic  in  the  training  of  science  fields  such  as  physics–
costly  or  inadequate  laboratory  equipment,  mistake  of 
equipment,  difficulty  in  simulating  certain  experimental 
circumstances  [25].  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  can  be  a 
successful  approach  to  tackling  these  problems.  A  study 
about  magnetic  field  instruction  has  been  conducted  in 
relation  to  the  aforementioned  problems.  Results  of  the 
analysis demonstratesd that the movement-sensing software 
based on AR can enhance the learning attitude and learning 
result  of  the  learners.  This  research  offers  a  case  for 
applying AR technology to secondary education in physics 
[25].  

In learning about health science, medical anatomy and 
neurosurgical  it  is  also  very  helpful  to  use  Augmented 
Reality  as  a  learning  tool.  In  an  environment  where 
required  structure  needs  to  be  examined  from  all  angles, 
anatomical learning is best performed using a tool that will 
show this angles [26]. Augmented Reality is one of the best 
tool to show angles as the developer can easily manipulate 
how the augmented object will rotate and show. Compared 
to  traditional  pedagogical  schemes,  VR  and  AR  have  the 
ability  to  produce  improved  teaching  environments.  3D 
learning  environments  can  increase  the  motivation 
/ 
engagement  of  learners,  improve  the  representation  of 
spatial information, improve learning contextualization and 
create  superior  technical  skills.  Over  the  previous  several 
centuries,  neurosurgical  has  experienced  a  technological 
revolution,  from  trephination  to  image-guided  navigation. 
Advances  in  Virtual  Reality  (VR)  and  Augmented  Reality 
(AR)  are  some  of  the  latest  ways  of  integrating  into 
neurosurgical exercise and resident education [27]. 

that  AR 

Studies  have  shown 

technology  can 
significantly improve the results of education. For example, 
AR  enables  learners  participate  in  real-world  genuine 
explorations  such  as  marine  life  explorations  that  not 
everyone  has  been  able  to  achieve  [28].  Marine  schooling 
includes  problems  that  are  wealthy  and  multifaceted. 
Raising awareness of marine settings and problems requires 
fresh teaching materials to be developed.  

In  line  with  that,  a  digital  game-based  learning  was 
tailored for primary school learners to design an innovative 
marine  learning  program  incorporating  augmented  reality 
(AR) technology [29]. The results of using this technology 
are  the  following:  (1)  learners  were  extremely  confident 
and  satisfactorily  viewed  the  learning  operations  ;  (2) 
learners obtained target goal for understanding ; and (3) the 
innovative 
teaching  program  specifically  helps  small 
academic  achievements  and  enhance  learning  efficiency. 
Another great application of Augmented Reality in science 
is  an  AR-based  simulation  scheme  for  a  cooperative 
investigation-based  teaching  activity  in  a  science  course 
and  discovered  that  AR-based  simulation  could  involve 
learners  more  deeply  in  the  investigatory  project  activity 
than traditional simulation could [30].

With,  it  can  easily  be  inferred  that  from  the  birth  of 
AR  it  is  already  related  to  Mathematics.  AR  makes 
mathematical  ideas  simpler  to  comprehend  because  it 
provides  better  visualization  and  interaction.  We  can 
therefore  conclude  that  three-dimensional  techniques,  such 
as AR, improve mathematics teaching and learning. At the 
same time as the imperative to better comprehend the use of 
mobile  devices  for  learning  mathematics  in  many  nations, 
there  is  a  powerful  political  will  to  enhance  teaching  and 
learning  process  in  mathematics  education  to  support 
innovation  that  drives  economic  growth  and  create  the 
capacity  of  tomorrow's  workers  for  future  work  markets 
[44].

CONCLUSION 

teaching 

improved  settings 

Research has  shown  that  AR  can  be  more  efficient  in 
supporting 
in 
than  other 
technology. If content is represented as 3D learners, objects 
can  be  manipulated  and  information  handled  interactively 
(El  Sayed,  Zayed,  &  Sharawy  as  cited  by  Buchner  & 
Zumbach, 2018).  Rapid  technological  evolution has altered 
the face of education, particularly when technology has been 
coupled  with  appropriate  pedagogical  foundations.  This 
combination  has  developed  fresh  possibilities  to  enhance 
teaching and learning experience quality [46]. 

Based  on  the  findings,  Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a 
technological strategy that offers apps that enable learners to 
communicate with the actual globe through virtual data, and 
Game-Based Learning (GBL) is a pedagogical strategy that 
promotes the use of learning games to sum up all preceding 
discussions.  Combining  the  two  process  will  definitely 
result  to  a  new  system  that  will  give  a  big  impact  in  the 
education industry [22].
