Normal incidence 1 keV Ar+ ion bombardment leads to amorphization and ultrasmoothing of Ge at
room temperature, but at elevated temperatures the Ge surface remains crystalline and is unstable
to the formation of self-organized nanoscale patterns of ordered pyramid-shaped pits. The physical
phenomenon distinguishing the high temperature patterning from room temperature ultrasmoothing
is believed to be a surface instability due to the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier for diﬀusing vacancies and
adatoms, which is not present on the amorphous material. This real-time GISAXS study compares

relatively small in height, the average kinetics can be explained by a linear theory. The linear
theory coeﬃcients, indicating surface stability or instability, were extracted for both experiments.
A comparison between the two measurements allows estimation of the contribution of the Ehrlich-
Schwoebel barrier to the self-organized formation of ordered nanoscale patterns on crystalline Ge
surfaces.

Elemental semiconductor surfaces bombarded by a
broad ion beam at normal incidence are ultrasmoothed
[1, 2] at room temperature. For high polar angle ion
bombardment, self-organized nanoscale ripple patterns
are observed at room temperature [3–6]. However, the
surface is amorphized, and the pattern formation is due
to instabilities related to the curvature dependence of
sputter erosion [7, 8], and to impact-induced mass redis-
tribution [9], both of which occur together with a sta-
bilizing process or processes such as surface diﬀusion or

ing normal-incidence ion bombardment above the cor-
responding recrystallation temperature, ordered, faceted
patterns are known to form spontaneously along crys-
tal directions on elemental or compound semiconductors
[11, 12]. The crystalline pattern formation at elevated
temperatures is believed to be due mainly due to the
surface instability caused by the Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES)
barrier [12].

In this work, we use real-time experiments with sample
temperatures above and below the recrystalliation tem-
perature of Ge to quantitatively measure the ES barrier’s
contribution to the self-organized pattern formation dur-
ing 1 keV Ar+ bombardment of Ge. The high temper-
ature sample, which was initially ﬂat, was bombarded
at a temperature of 300◦C, leading to self-organized pat-
tern formation of ordered pyramid-shaped pits with four-
fold symmetry. On the other hand, normal incidence

ion bombardment of a Ge surface at room temperature
smooths it. This hinders X-ray studies by reducing the
scattering intensities from the surface. Therefore, to
achieve suﬃcient scattering intensities, the room tem-
perature experiment was conducted by normal-incidence
bombardment of a pre-patterned Ge sample.

For the experiment, 500 µm thick n-doped (Sb)
Ge(001) wafers were cut into 1 × 1 cm2 pieces and
cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and methanol.
Samples were ﬁrmly aﬃxed to a stage by spot welding
Ta strips at the two opposite corners. The water-cooled
sample stage base supported a heater which in turn was
directly beneath a thermocouple and the sample. For the
high temperature bombardment experiment, the sample
temperature was kept at 300◦C. Additionally, the sample
stage was electrically isolated except for a wire leading
out to an ampere meter in order to measure ion ﬂux. The
sample holder was mounted in a custom UHV chamber
with mica X-ray windows and a base pressure of 5 ×
10−6 Torr. For both experiments, samples were bom-
barded with a broad beam of 1 keV Ar+ ions, which was
generated by a 3-cm graphite-grid ion source from Veeco
Instruments Inc. placed at 0◦ ion incidence angle (θ).
The ion beam ﬂux was measured to be 1 × 1015 ions
cm−2s−1 at the operating chamber pressure of 2 × 10−4
Torr. The ﬁnal ﬂuences were 1.1 × 1017 ions cm−2 for the
room temperature smoothing and 2.4 × 1018 ions cm−2
for the high temperature patterning.

Real-time X-ray scattering experiments were per-
formed at the Coherent Hard X-ray (CHX) beamline at
the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) of

FIG. 1. A schematic diagram of the GISAXS experiment.
The ion source is placed at the polar angle θ = 0◦, which
produces amorphization and ultrasmoothing at low sample
temperature and self-organized crystalline patterning at high
sample temperature. Ge(001) is positioned so that the X-ray
incident angle αi is slightly above the critical angle of total
external reﬂection. The scattering intensity is recorded as a
function of the exit angles αi and ψ using a 2D detector.

of the scattering pattern due to the self-organized formation

9.65 keV was selected with a ﬂux of approximately 5 ×
1011 photon s−1 and beam dimensions 10 × 10 µm2. Ex-
periments used an Eiger-X 4M detector (Dectris) with
75 µm pixel size, which was located 10.3 m from the
sample. The incident X-ray angle αi was 0.39◦, which
is slightly above the critical angle of total external re-
ﬂection for Germanium of 0.25◦. The scattered intensity
was recorded as a function of the exit angle αf and ψ
using the 2D detector, as shown in Fig. 1. The change in
X-ray wavevector q can be calculated from those angles:

Since qx is small, the horizontal component q|| (parallel
to the surface) can be approximated as simply qy and the
vertical component as qz (perpendicular to the surface).
In the analysis of this paper, we will primarily be inter-
ested in the scattering along the Yoneda wing, which is
particularly sensitive to surface structure. Example scat-
tering patterns recorded on the area detector are shown
in Fig. 2.

where v0 is the constant erosion rate of the ﬂat Ge sur-
face, ν∇2h is the curvature dependent sputter rate, jion
is the surface current resulting from the ballistic mass
redistribution, and jdiﬀ represents the surface current
due to diﬀusion. κ is the isotropic Herring-Mullins (HM)
surface diﬀusion. σ is the non-linear conserved Kadar-
Parisi- Zhang coeﬃcient. jdiﬀ , which has the ES bar-
rier coeﬃcient (cid:15) and the parameter δ (the angle of the
facets are given by θ = ±arctan((cid:112)1/δ)), represents the
anisotropic current that incorporates both the anisotropy
of the ES barrier itself and step edge diﬀusion. The last
term η (x, y, t) is stochastic noise.

When slopes are small, such as in the early stages of
patterning of an initially-ﬂat sample or in the slightly
later stages of smoothing an initially patterned surface,
the nonlinear terms of Eq. 2 can be neglected and the
equation reduces to a linear form, which is then Fourier
transformed [6, 8]:

A post facto AFM image conﬁrms the formation of or-
dered faceted patterns on the high temperature sample
as seen in Fig. 3. To explain the patterning phenomenon,
Ou et al. used the following continuum equation [12] in
their simulations, which well reproduced the experimen-
tal observations of ordered pyramidal pit patterns on Ge:

where ˜h (q, t) is the Fourier transform of the surface
height h (x, y, t), R (q) is the ampliﬁcation factor or dis-
persion relation, and ˜η (q, t) is the Fourier transform of
a stochastic noise. The ampliﬁcation factor can be de-
termined experimentally by measuring the q-averaged
height-height structure factor evolution [6, 13]:

(cid:104)η (r, t) η (r(cid:48), t)(cid:105) = n δ(r − r(cid:48))δ(t − t(cid:48)). The ampliﬁca-
tion factor diﬀerentiates surface stability or instability; a
positive R(q) drives exponential ampliﬁcation of modes
of wavevector q resulting in surface instability, while a
negative R(q) damps ﬂuctuations and stabilizes modes
of wavevector q.

To determine R(q), the q-averaged intensities were
ﬁrst computed by averaging 10 detector pixels in the q||
direction (∆q|| = ±0.004 nm−1) and 70 pixels in the qz
direction (∆qz = ±0.028 nm−1). The temporal evolution
of the scattered intensity from each wavenumber bin was
then ﬁtted with a function of the form I(q||, t) = ae2Rt+b,
as in Eq. 4, with a, b and R being independent ﬁt pa-
rameters for each q|| bin. The time scales over which
the linear theory is valid diﬀer from one q|| bin to an-
other since structural evolution happens faster at smaller

each wavenumber of interest, χ2 was computed to de-
termine optimum time scales over which the ﬁts were
performed. Near the peak wavenumber, there is an ex-
ponential growth, indicating surface instability. On the
other hand, the measured R(q||) for room temperature
bombardment are all negative, showing surface stability
at all wavenumbers.

The ampliﬁcation factor is usually taken to have a

form[6]:

R(q||) = −Sy q2

where Sy is a coeﬃcient of curvature-dependent surface
evolution, incorporating the curvature-dependent sputter
erosion (the ν term in Eq. 2), lateral mass redistribution
(the ∇jion term), and, in the case of a crystalline surface,
the linear part of the ES term (cid:15). The coeﬃcient B (the κ
term in the case of high temperature patterning accord-
ing to Eq. 2) is a measure of surface diﬀusion and/or
surface conﬁned viscous ﬂow.

slightly larger period of the patterns.

For the room temperature smoothing experiment, the
pre-patterned Ge sample was bombarded beforehand and
had well-developed faceted patterns with four-fold sym-
metry, similar to the ﬁnal result of the high-temperature
experiment as shown in Fig. 3. After 10 seconds of bom-
bardment, amorphization had occurred and decrease in
x-ray intensity indicates that the large nanoscale struc-
tures had been signiﬁcantly suppressed. Then, the scat-
tering intensities from the pre-patterned sample started
to decay at exponential rates, which were well ﬁtted by

the linear theory model, yielding R(q||). The measured
R(q||) values in the room temperature experiment were
then ﬁtted with Eq. 5 as shown in Fig. 5(b).

The results for the two samples are tabulated in Ta-
ble I. The room temperature curvature-dependent term
y = 2.25 ± 0.13 nm2s−1 has opposite sign compared
SRT
to SHT
. This diﬀerence in sign is expected due to the
y
instability in the high temperature experiment leading to
the formation of patterns versus the surface stability and
smoothing in the room temperature experiment.

As noted above, the Sy coeﬃcient in Eq. 5 includes
curvature dependent sputtering ν, lateral mass redistri-
bution, in the high temperature patterning case, it also
includes surface instability due to the presence of the
ES barrier term. Since the incident ion and most recoil
energies are far above thermal energies, we expect that
contributions from sputter erosion and lateral mass redis-
tribution are relatively independent of temperature, even
through the change in bombarded material from amor-
phous to crystalline with increasing temperature. How-
ever the ES barrier term only exists in the high tem-
perature patterning case. Therefore, subtraction of the
curvature-dependent term measured at the room temper-
ature smoothing SRT
from the curvature-dependent term

Turning to the smoothening term B, high wavenum-
bers play an important role since it multiplies q4

the case for Sy which multiplies q2

mined reliably by R(q||) values at low wavenumbers. The

contrast, BHT has a relatively small uncertainty due to
a wider range of accessible wavenumbers.

In the room temperature experiment, BRT is be-
lieved to be due primarily to ion-induced surface vis-
cous ﬂow[10].
It is generally believed that ion-induced
diﬀusion and any thermal relaxation are much smaller
at room temperature. Because the surface remains crys-
talline during high temperature nanopatterning BHT , on
the other hand, is presumably due to surface diﬀusion,
which could be a combination of thermal and/or ion-
induced. As far as we know, there is no compelling ratio-
nale suggesting that a pure ion-induced surface diﬀusion
should be much larger on a crystalline surface than on an
amorphous surface. Therefore it appears that the large
value of BHT relative to BRT is because of thermal re-
laxation processes.

In summary,

the ES barrier contribution to the
curvature-dependent patterning of Ge was determined
by subtracting the measured curvature-dependent term
for room temperature smoothing from that of high tem-
perature patterning. Compared to the erosive and lat-
eral mass redistribution contributions to the curvature-
dependent term, the magnitude of the ES barrier term
is considerably larger in magnitude. Within the context
of the continuum equation Eq. 2, the ES barrier con-
tribution (cid:15) is primarily responsible for the instability of
the crystalline Ge surface. Development of a theoret-
ical formalism linking the measured ES barrier kinetic
term to the size of the ES barrier energy in the self-
organized ion beam nanopatterning would be a very in-
teresting direction of future research and allow compari-

son with the existing ES barrier measurement in Ge(001)
homoepitaxy[19].
