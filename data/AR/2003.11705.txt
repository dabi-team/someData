The radioactive noble gas radon-222 (222Rn, or Rn) produced in the uranium series is a crucial
background source in many underground experiments. We have estimated the adsorption prop-
erty of Rn with Activated Carbon Fibers (ACFs) in air (Air), argon (Ar), and xenon (Xe) gas. In
this study, we evaluated six ACFs, named A-7, A-10, A-15, A-20, A-25, and S-25, provided from
UNITIKA Ltd. We measured intrinsic radioactivity of these ACF samples, and found A-20’s
radioactivity of the uranium series is < 5.5 mBq/kg with 90% conﬁdence level. In Air and Ar
gas, we found ACF A-15 has the adsorption eﬃciency of 1/10000 reduction at maximum before
saturation of Rn adsorption, and more than 97% adsorption eﬃciency after the saturation. In
Xe gas, we found ACF A-20 has the best Rn adsorption ability among tested ACFs. We also
found S-25, A-25, and A-15 have similar Rn adsorption performance.

Introduction

1.1 Xenon for underground experiment and radon background

Xenon (Xe) is one of the attractive materials in the ﬁeld of a particle physics experiment.
Since Xe has no long-lived radioactive isotopes of its own, Xe is intrinsically radio-pure,
except for the double beta decay (136Xe) and double electron capture (124Xe) nuclide [1, 2].
Because of its nuclear properties (such as spin, atomic mass number) as well as its ease of

scalability, Xe is widely used as a target of direct dark matter searches [3–6] and a source
of double beta decay searches [7–10] in underground experiments. Recently, other decay
processes of Xe atom, such as neutrino-less double electron capture (0νECEC) or neutrino-
less quadruple beta decay (0ν4β−), are proposed to theoretically explain lepton number
violation [11–13].

In these rare event search experiments, radioactive impurities in liquid or gas Xe are severe
background sources. In particular, the noble gas radon-222 (222Rn, or Rn) is continuously
produced from the decay of radium-226 (226Ra) in the detector material. Because of its long
decay time (about 3.8 days), the produced Rn enters into the sensitive volume of the detector

and results in generating mimic signals below the multi-MeV region. Therefore, the removal
of Rn in Xe is an essential technique to improve the sensitivity of such experiments [14, 15].

There are two strategies to reduce Rn in the detector: one is a careful material screen-
ing before detector construction and the other is Rn removal during the observation phase

with the detector. Before constructing the detector, radio impurity of materials should be
measured with a screening device such as a high-purity germanium detector, an inductively

coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), or any other special screening systems [16–22].

Once the detector is constructed, the Rn emanation from any type of material is basically

ﬁxed. Therefore, emanating Rn should be removed through the puriﬁcation process. Several
studies for the Rn removal in Xe gas have been conducted, for example, the development

of the distillation column and the single-column adsorption using an activated charcoal [23–
25]. Both Rn removal techniques have merits and demerits. In the case of adsorption, a

separation between Xe and Rn by using an adsorbent is challenging because both elements
are noble gases and have similar molecule sizes. Therefore, it is important to use appropriate
adsorbent for the selective adsorption of Rn in Xe.

1.2 Activated carbon ﬁber

An activated charcoal is an eﬀective adsorbent for various impurities by physical process
based on the van-del-Waals forces and polarizability of the atoms [26]. For example, an

activated charcoal has an excellent ability to remove Rn from argon (Ar) [27]. However,

2

when the molecule sizes of the inert gas and Rn are similar, such as Xe, both Rn and Xe are
tended to be adsorbed by an adsorbent. Therefore, the average pore size of the adsorbent

should be selected carefully. Another valuable property is an eﬀective surface area of the
adsorbent. Larger surface areas allow increasing the adsorption eﬃciency. Furthermore, since

Rn emanation from the adsorbent itself ultimately limits the Rn removal ability, it is required
to reduce the amount of internal radioactive impurities in the adsorbent.

Activated carbon ﬁber (ACF) has been commercially available since the 1990s [28]. ACF
is a major adsorbent because it has a large surface area and good adsorption property. The
general adsorption properties of ACF have been reported in various papers [29–32]. However,

its application to adsorb Rn in Xe gas has not been reported yet.

For this study, several kinds of ACFs are specially provided from UNITIKA Ltd1. Figure 1
shows a picture of a typical ACF provided from UNITIKA Ltd. The provided ACFs are
named A-7, A-10, A-15, A-20, A-25 and S-25. Among them, A-25 and S-25 are test products,

and others are commercial products. For the selective Rn adsorption, the pore parameters
are essential. Such basic properties of these ACFs are summarized in Table 1.

The purpose of this report is to provide basic performances on Rn adsorption of these
ACFs in Xe in various conditions. This report consists ﬁve sections, including this introduc-
tion. In Section 2, we describe the radioactive impurities of those ACFs and compare their

radioactivity with other activated charcoals reported in the earlier studies. In Section 3, we
describe the measurement system designed to evaluate the Rn adsorption eﬃciency of the

ACFs. Then, we present the performance of this system using puriﬁed air (Air), Ar gas, and

show the comparisons of the adsorption eﬃciency among those ACFs. In the last section, we
summarize this study.

2 Radioactive impurity measurements

As explained in Section 1, the radon emanation from an adsorbent limits the Rn adsorp-
tion ability. Therefore low-intrinsic radioactivity of 226Ra (or uranium series) is required for
an adsorbent. We measured the intrinsic radioactive contamination of the provided ACFs

with high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) in Kamioka Observatory, the Institute for
Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR), the University of Tokyo and in Kavli Institute for the Physics
and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU), the University of Tokyo. For this evaluation, we

measured four ACFs, which are A-10, A-15, A-20, and A-25. We put those ACFs into an
EVOH (Ethylene-vinylalcohol copolymer) plastic bag in order to keep emanated Rn from the

samples, then the measurements are carried out for about 10 days after reaching radiation
equilibrium. This HPGe assay method is reported in Ref. [33].

The results of the measurements are summarized in Table 2 as well as the other
measurements of activated charcoals by the XMASS collaboration [25] and the XENON

collaboration [34]. For these ACFs, we could not observe any signiﬁcant gamma-ray line
over the background spectrum in the measurements in Table 22. Therefore, we have esti-
mated the upper limits. The obtained upper limit of A-20 is < 5.5 mBq/kg for the uranium
series. Comparing the radioactivity of the uranium series with other reports [25, 34], A-20

2 However, we observed 63 ± 9 mBq/kg of 228Th (half life is 1.9 years) only in the A-20 sample. We think
it would be a contamination in the preparation process of this A-20 sample, and this contamination will not
aﬀect 222Rn assays.

ments of activated charcoals are also shown. The measurement device is a high-purity
germanium detector (HPGe) or proportional counter (PC). For the HPGe measurements,
lead-214 (214Pb) and bismuth-214 (214Bi) are used for the estimation of uranium series, and
actinium-228 (228Ac) is used for the estimation of thorium series. The upper limit values are
90% conﬁdence level.

3 Experimental setup

3.1 Test measurements with puriﬁed air and argon

As a ﬁrst step, we evaluated the Rn adsorption performance of ACF in puriﬁed Air and in
puriﬁed Ar. We used G1 grade puriﬁed gases (impurities are less than 0.3 ppm) provided from
TAIYO NIPPON SANSO CORPORATION [35]. Since the molecular sizes of nitrogen (N2),
oxygen (O2) and Ar are relatively small compared with that of Rn, the adsorption of the Rn
in puriﬁed Air or Ar is expected to be eﬃcient. To date, adsorption techniques of Rn in Air or
N2 with activated charcoals have been established among underground experiments [36–40].
In order to perform the test measurements with Air or Ar, we have constructed a test

bench at Kobe University, Japan. The test bench is based on the measurement system
developed in Ref. [27]. The test bench for this study consists of a high-sensitivity 80-L Rn

measures radioisotopes inside the sample also.

detector [36, 41], a gas mass ﬂow controller (HORIBA STEC, SEC-Z512MGX, hereafter
MFC), a gas circulation pump (ENOMOTO Micro Pump Mfg. Co. Ltd., MX-808ST-S),

a dew point gauge (VAISALA, DMT152), a pressure gauge (Swagelok, PGU-50-MC01-L-
4FSF), ﬁlters (NIPPON SEISEN Co. Ltd., NASclean GF-T001 and GF-D03N), a refrigerator

with a cold trap, and a Rn source (PYLON, RNC). The radioactivity of this source is
78.3 Bq (226Ra). This refrigerator is equipped with a box-shaped cold trap [27]. A schematic
view of this test bench corresponds to the system shown in Figure 3 in Section 3.2 without

the main trap in that ﬁgure.

The principal techniques of the 80-L Rn detector are the electrostatic collection of the
positively charged daughter nuclei of 222Rn [42, 43] and the deposit energy measurement of
their α decays on a PIN photodiode [36, 41, 44–47]. The 80-L Rn detector can measure a
few mBq/m3 level of Rn concentration in the circulation gas. The details of the 80-L Rn
detector can be found in Ref. [36, 41].

Here are typical operations before the test measurements with this test bench. For the

measurements in this section, we put 4.75 g of ACF A-15 into the box-shaped trap. After
preparation of the ACF sample in a box-shaped trap, we baked the trap at +85◦C under
vacuum with a turbo molecular pump. After the vacuum pressure became less than 1.0 ×
10−1 Pa, we stopped the baking, then started cooling down of the box-shaped trap to −105◦C.
In parallel, the test bench was ﬁlled with puriﬁed Air or Ar. When we changed the gas in

the system, the entire system was evacuated before ﬁlling, except for the Rn source. The
Rn source was purged with the new gas in advance. The typical pressure of the gas in the
system is at atmospheric pressure (around 0.10 MPa in absolute pressure, or ±0.000 MPa
in gauge pressure). It is noted in this report that we use gauge pressure values to express

the inner gas pressure of the test bench if it is not speciﬁed. The gas was circulated with the
circulation pump after ﬁlling.

There are three steps after the preparation of the cold trap and the circulation gas. The

ﬁrst phase is the injection of Rn into the circulation gas from the Rn source. The second
phase is the adsorption of Rn with the cooled box-shaped trap. The third phase is the release
of Rn from the trap by heating the trap to the normal temperature (between +15◦C and
+25◦C). During these phases, the ﬂow rate of the circulation gas was kept at the same ﬂow
rate with the MFC in the system. The 80-L Rn detector was also continuously monitoring

the Rn concentration in the circulation gas, during these phases. The observed number of
polonium-214 (214Po) events from the 80-L Rn detector was summarized every 10 minutes,
then the observed count rate is converted into the Rn concentration with the calibration
factor in Ref. [36, 41]. Therefore, we obtained Rn concentration in the circulation gas every

10 minutes.

Fig. 2 The left side (right side) plot shows measurements with puriﬁed Air (Ar). The
upper (lower) panel shows the Rn concentration (Rn adsorption eﬃciency) as a function of
time. In the top panel, the colored data points show the diﬀerent phases of the measurements,

where green, blue, and red show the Rn concentration in the injection phase, in the adsorption
phase, and the release phase, respectively. The orange (pink) line in the upper panel shows
the Rn decay curves for expected (remaining) Rn concentrations.

Figure 2 shows the results of these test measurements. For the test measurement with
Air, we injected Rn at 15:51 on December 7th, 2016. The gas circulation rate was 0.90 SLM

(liter per minute at standard temperature and pressure) and then we started the adsorption
phase from 10:52 on December 8th. The Rn concentration dropped soon after starting the
adsorption phase and it took about 24 hours to reach the lowest value. At the moment, the

Rn adsorption eﬃciency reached a maximum of nearly 100% with the reduction factor of
104.

In general, further adsorption is not expected when all pore sites are ﬁlled with gas
molecules. Under such situation, adsorbed Rn is eventually released from ACF by collision

with other molecules in circulation gas. Consequently, some of Rn returns into the circula-
tion gas again because of such saturation. This situation is called break-through. The Rn

concentration in the system ultimately reaches the equilibrium state between the adsorption
and the release.

In the measurements with Air or Ar, the Rn concentration gradually increased to about
∼10 Bq/m3 level after reaching the lowest value, and this can be explained as the reason
above. During this phase, the Rn adsorption eﬃciency ﬁnally becomes 97.9 ± 0.1%. After
starting the release phase at 14:39 on December 11th, the Rn concentration immediately

increased and then reached to the originally expected level.

For the test measurement with Ar, we have evaluated the Rn adsorption eﬃciency
with the same procedure with the gas circulation rate at 1.3 SLM. The result is shown
in Figure 2 (right). Its Rn adsorption eﬃciency is determined to be 98.3 ± 0.1% as summa-
rized in Table 3. Though the adsorption eﬃciency of Air and Ar measurements are similar,

the break-through time of Ar looks shorter than that of Air. This would be due to the dif-
ference of the gas ﬂow rates of these tests. From these test measurements, we demonstrated
that this system can precisely measure the Rn adsorption eﬃciency of ACF in both Air and

Ar. In addition to this, we found that ACF A-15 showed a good Rn adsorption eﬃciency.

3.2 Measurement system for Xe gas

For the measurements using Xe gas, we added a new refrigerator with a larger cold
trap to increase the amount of the ACF sample. A schematic diagram of the full system is
shown in Figure 3. The gas in the system was circulated by the circulation pump. The Rn

concentration in the circulation gas was measured with the 80-L Rn detector. The pressure,
temperature, and dew point were monitored continuously during the measurement.

In this system, two cold traps (main trap and box-shaped trap) were used. The main

trap is a U-shaped electro-polished stainless steel pipe, and can typically hold 10–20 g of
an ACF sample. The main trap is used to hold the ACF sample to estimate Rn adsorption
eﬃciency, and its volume is 122 cm3. The temperature of the ACF sample was controlled by
the refrigerator for the main trap. Photographs of the main trap are shown in Figure 4. The

box-shaped trap is used to control humidity in the circulation gas for the measurements with
Xe. In the actual measurement with Xe gas, the box-shaped trap was always kept at −70◦C
to keep low humidity conditions. We tested this box-shaped trap in Xe gas, then conﬁrmed

the eﬀect from the box-shaped trap was negligible in Xe gas.

In order to prevent possible contamination of carbon ﬁbers from the ACF sample into
the measurement system, thin-layer metal membrane ﬁlters (0.0025 µm and 0.3 µm) are

installed at the inlet and outlet of the cold traps.

Fig. 3

Experimental setup of the full test bench. The Rn detector was upgraded to an

80-L detector from the system in Ref. [27]. Then, a new refrigerator and a new larger cold
trap (main trap) were newly added for the measurements with Xe gas. The arrows show the
direction of the circulation gas ﬂow.

3.3 Measurement method

Here is a typical measurement method with the main trap. Before the measurements, we
put an ACF sample into the main trap. Then we evacuated the main trap with baking at
+180◦C. After the vacuum pressure became less than 1.0 × 10−1 Pa in absolute pressure,
we stopped the baking, and then put the main trap into the cooling system. Finally, the

measurement system was ﬁlled with Xe gas. The typical circulation gas pressure was at
atmospheric pressure, but it was reduced down to −0.071 MPa in the case of the pressure
dependence measurement described in Section 4.3. The Xe gas was circulated with the pump
after ﬁlling at 0.14–1.4 SLM.

The three steps (injection, adsorption, and release phases) are same as the test measure-

ment described in Section 3.1, but the temperature condition was changed for the main trap.
All the temperature setting of the main refrigerator during the adsorption phase are −95◦C.
The typical temperature setting during the release phase is normal temperature. In some
measurements, the temperature at the beginning of the release phase was set at +180◦C to
increase release speed. In each step, the measurement continues until the count rate of the

Rn detector becomes stable. The adsorption phase was started by switching the inlet and

outlet valves of the main trap from by-pass mode to through-trap mode. Using the 80-L Rn
detector, the Rn concentration in the circulation gas was continuously monitored.

3.4 Data analysis

In order to measure the Rn adsorption eﬃciency in the circulation gas, we have per-

formed the following analysis procedure. At ﬁrst, the Rn concentration in the circulation
gas is determined by the ﬁtting with the Rn decay curve, deﬁned as C0e−λt + C1 [Bq/m3],
where λ is the decay constant of 222Rn, t is elapsed time, C0 and C1 are parameters to
be ﬁtted. Applying this equation to the data before the adsorption phase, the expected Rn
concentration without Rn adsorption (Cexpected) at t = 0 is obtained as C0 + C1 [Bq/m3].
When this equation is applied to the data during the adsorption phase, the remaining Rn
concentration after Rn adsorption by the cold trap (Cremaining) at t = 0 is obtained, as well.
The expected ﬁtted line is compared with the data after the release phase, in order to check
the consistency of the Cexpected value.

Then, we compare the remaining Rn concentration with the expected Rn concentration

as follows;

R =

Cexpected − Cremaining
Cexpected

× 100.0 [%].

(1)

In this report, we use the R [%] as the Rn adsorption eﬃciency.

Fig. 5

An example of the measurements with Xe gas with ACF A-25. The Xe gas
pressure before the adsorption phase, Xe gas pressure before the release phase, and ﬂow
rate in left (right) are −0.071 MPa (−0.071 MPa), −0.076 MPa (−0.075 MPa) and
0.41 SLM (0.14 SLM), respectively. The plot and color deﬁnitions are the same as Figure 2.
The black open circles in the right-upper plot is Rn concentration obtained from 218Po
counts.

3.5 A typical measurement in Xe gas and systematic uncertainty

Figure 5 shows an example of the measurements with Xe gas. In these measurements,
ACF A-25 was used in Xe circulation gas at −0.071 MPa, and we observed a clear drop of the
Rn concentration during the adsorption phase. The Rn concentration drops in 0.41 SLM and

0.14 SLM ﬂow rate measurements are very similar at around 60%. An apparent oscillation
of the Rn concentration in the adsorption phase is observed in the 0.14 SLM ﬂow rate

measurement. This behavior is similar to Ref. [25].

We also observed a pressure diﬀerence between the adsorption phase and other phases.
The pressure drop during the adsorption phase was due to the adsorption of both Xe and

Rn by the ACF. This pressure diﬀerence suggests an actual Rn adsorption eﬃciency might
be lower than observed R deﬁned in Section 3.4. Therefore we have evaluated the amount

of the pressure diﬀerence as a systematic uncertainty on the Rn adsorption eﬃciency.

In the case of the 0.41 SLM measurement, the pressure diﬀerence was 0.0050 MPa and the

absolute pressure before the adsorption phase was 0.0303 MPa. Based on this diﬀerence, we
assigned the systematic error of −16.5% on the absorption eﬃciency. Typical gauge pressure
values of the circulation gas were ±0.000 MPa in the adsorption phase and +0.005 MPa
in other phases, except for the pressure dependence measurement. This pressure diﬀerence
corresponds to −5.0% systematic uncertainty, typically.

11

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The accuracy of the pressure of the circulation gas has around ±0.001 MPa uncertainty,
since the pressure gauge is an analog type. Because of this accuracy, we assigned a few %

level of uncertainty on the Rn adsorption eﬃciency. This systematic uncertainty ranges from
−3.0% to −1.0% depending on the pressure inside the system (−3.0% for the lowest case of
−0.07 MPa and −1.0% for atmospheric pressure). This uncertainty will reduce or enhance the
uncertainty on the Rn adsorption eﬃciency from the pressure drop. We estimated maximum
enhancement as a systematic error source.

In the very similar condition measurements, the observed Rn adsorption eﬃciency was
slightly diﬀerent within about a few %. Therefore, we assigned systematic uncertainty from
reproducibility as ±2.0%.

The assigned systematic uncertainties in this study are summarized in Table 4.

The observed Rn adsorption eﬃciency values in Xe of the 0.41 SLM and 0.14 SLM ﬂow
rate measurements were 60.8 ± 0.3(stat.)+2.0
−13.6(syst.)%,
respectively. The uncertainty from the pressure drop in the adsorption phase is estimated

−16.9(syst.)%, and 58.5 ± 0.3(stat.)+2.0

with actual pressure drop in each measurement.

In preceding studies [25, 34], the velocity ratio (or retention time ratio) of Rn to Xe in
the adsorbent is estimated as a Rn trap performance of the test system. We also estimate

the velocity ratio from the measurement in Fig. 5 right. In this measurement, we have
observed retention time of Rn (TRn in Ref. [25]) in the main trap as 10 ± 2 hours, using
the 218Po data, then the velocity ratio becomes vRn/vXe = (1.4 ± 0.2) × 10−3 (at −95◦C).
The corresponding ratios in the preceding studies are vRn/vXe = (0.96 ± 0.10) × 10−3 (at
−85◦C) [25] and vRn/vXe = (0.65 ± 0.11) × 10−3 (at −70◦C) [34]. This means velocity of Rn
in the adsorbent column in our test bench (= main trap) is faster than others. The main
reason of this diﬀerence would be due to the diﬀerence of the density of the adsorbent in the

column. From the information in Ref. [25], the adsorbent density in the column is estimated
as about 358 kg/m3. On the other hand, that from our system is 98 kg/m3, since we could
not pack ﬁbers into the U-shaped column very eﬃciently.

12

Then, using this velocity ratio, we also estimate the two component Henry’s constant
of the adsorbent ˜H which is introduced in Ref. [34]. In the report, they obtained ˜H =
(1.94 ± 0.24) × 10−3 mol/(Pa kg) (at −70◦C, −0.080 MPa Xe). From our measurement, we
obtained ˜H = (5.0 ± 1.0) × 10−3 mol/(Pa kg) (at −95◦C, −0.071 MPa Xe). Though the
conditions of the measurement are diﬀerent, our adsorbent shows comparable adsorption
performance with the preceding work.

4 Result

In this section, we describe the measurement results of the Rn adsorption eﬃciency in Xe
gas. As a ﬁrst step, we evaluated a possible ﬂow rate dependence of the Rn adsorption eﬃ-
ciency using ACF A-25. Then, its Rn concentration dependence and circulation gas pressure

dependence was evaluated with A-25. After presenting the results from these dependence
measurement, we discuss the Rn adsorption eﬃciency among the six ACFs provided by the

company.

4.1 Flow rate dependence

At ﬁrst, we evaluated the ﬂow rate dependence of the Rn adsorption eﬃciency using
10.50 g of A-25. The experimental procedure is the same as the typical measurement

explained in Section 3.3, but we changed the circulation gas ﬂow rate using MFC. We also
kept the Rn source connected during this measurement in order to maintain the same Rn

concentration level. Therefore, the diﬀerence should be only the ﬂow rate of the circulation
gas. Typical Rn concentration and circulation gas pressure are 103 Bq/m3 and atmospheric
pressure, respectively.

The obtained results are summarized in Table 5. Here, the systematic errors are obtained

uncertainty would be only reproducibility (±2.0%), since the pressure drops are very similar
in these measurements.

Fig. 6

The left side (right side) plot shows Rn adsorption eﬃciency (Rn adsorption
amount) as a function of the Rn concentration just before the adsorption phase. The black
points are observed R, and the blue bars are statistical and systematical errors, added

in quadrature. The red dashed line in the right side plot is a ﬁtting with a straight line
((Rn adsorption amount) = (0.025 ± 0.001) × (Rn concentration)). We used 10.50 g of A-
25 in these measurements. The circulation gas pressure of all the data points is atmospheric
pressure. The ﬂow rate of the circulation gas is ﬁxed at 1.4 SLM. The temperature setting
of the main refrigerator during the adsorption phase is ﬁxed at −95◦C.

Among these diﬀerent ﬂow rate measurements, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed.

Therefore, we found no signiﬁcant ﬂow rate dependence of measured Rn adsorption eﬃciency
in the test bench in between 0.14 and 1.4 SLM ﬂow rate.

4.2 Rn concentration dependence

As explained in Section 3.1, further adsorption is not expected when all pore sites are

ﬁlled with gas molecules. Therefore, the Rn adsorption eﬃciency may depend on the Rn
concentration of the circulation gas. In order to evaluate this dependence, we measured the

Rn adsorption eﬃciency under the diﬀerent Rn concentrations in the circulation gas. In these
measurements, 10.50 g of A-25 was used. Typical ﬂow rate and circulation gas pressure are

1.4 SLM and atmospheric pressure, respectively.

Figure 6 shows the measurement results. From Fig. 6 right, the absorbed Rn amount
looks generally proportional to the Rn concentration. Since the Rn concentration corre-

sponds to the partial pressure of Rn gas, this measurement may indicate Henry’s law in Rn
adsorption [34].

However, from Fig. 6 left, the Rn adsorption eﬃciency looks increasing in the region
below 50 Bq/m3. This dependence suggests that a high Rn absorption eﬃciency is expected

10.50 g of A-25 was used. The Rn concentration of all the data points are above 80 Bq/m3.

others. The temperature setting of the main refrigerator during the adsorption phase is ﬁxed
at −95◦C.

in the real experiments which search for rare physics events because the Rn concentration

level in such experiments is much less than this Rn concentration level. In the region of
50–300 Bq/m3, the Rn concentration dependence of the Rn adsorption eﬃciency is about
±3%, and this is similar as or slightly smaller than the systematic uncertainty of the Rn
adsorption eﬃciency estimated in Section 3.5.

4.3 Pressure dependence

In general, an adsorption on porous depends on both the temperature and the amount

of the adsorbed gas molecules. Therefore, the adsorption may depend on the circulation
gas pressure inside the system. In order to evaluate the dependence on the circulation gas
pressure, we measured the Rn adsorption eﬃciency of A-25 under the diﬀerent circula-

tion gas pressure. For this measurement, we decreased the circulation gas pressure down to
−0.071 MPa, at ﬁrst. Then, we added Xe gas (with some amount of Rn) into the system
to increase the inner gas pressure. Figure 7 shows the result of these measurements. In this
estimation, only the data points in which Rn concentration is more than 80 Bq/m3 was
selected to reduce the Rn concentration dependence of the Rn adsorption eﬃciency.

15

 
 
 
We found an apparent increase in the Rn adsorption eﬃciency when the circulation gas

pressure is low.

4.4 Comparison among ACF types

We have compared the Rn adsorption eﬃciency among diﬀerent ACF types. In this

comparison, the measurement data were selected as follows. The circulation gas pressure is
atmospheric pressure for all the data to eliminate pressure dependence of the Rn adsorption
eﬃciency. The ﬂow rate is between 0.14 SLM and 1.4 SLM, in which no dependence on the

Rn adsorption eﬃciency was observed. In this comparison, we normalized the Rn adsorption
eﬃciency values by weight, to the typical weight of ACF sample in the main trap (= 12 g),

since the amount of the ACF samples are diﬀerent. We could not adjust the Rn concentra-
tion level in each measurement, though we observed the Rn concentration dependence in
the region below 50 Bq/m3. Therefore, this comparison was done as a function of the Rn
concentration.

Figure 8 shows a summary of this comparison. In Figure 8, several A-25 measurements

are shown as a reference in diﬀerent Rn concentration regions. Table 6 summarizes numerical

information for typical data points shown in Figure 8. In Figure 9, the same measuremts
are shown using normalized Rn adsorption amount. In these comparison plots, the dominant

uncertainty is the pressure drop eﬀect in the lower error bars. Since it comes from the
interpretation of the pressure drop phenomenon, the uncertainties are taken into account

among all data points. Therefore the relative uncertainties among data points would be
about twice larger than the upper error bars.

Then, comparing each ACF type to A-25 in a similar Rn concentration area, the nor-

malized Rn adsorption eﬃciency (and amount) values of A-7, and A-10 are lower than that
of A-25. On the other hand, A-15, A-20, and S-25 show similar eﬃciency (and amount)

values as that of A-25. Among these measurements, A-20 shows a slightly higher eﬃciency
(and amount) value than A-25, though they are consistent within uncertainty. The observed
eﬃciency value of A-20 was (33.6+2.1
−6.4) % (12 g of A-20, in atmospheric pressure Xe and
442.8 ± 0.8 Bq/m3 Rn).

Among A-7, A-10, A-15, and A-20, the adsorption performance looks increasing in this

order. From Table 1, speciﬁc surface area, pore volume, and meso pore volume ratio are also
increasing in the same order. Since kinetic diameters (Lennard-Jones parameter σ) of Air, Ar,

Xe, and Rn gas molecules are estimated as 0.352–0.369 nm, 0.340–0.346 nm, 0.392–0.410 nm,
and 0.417–0.421 nm, respectively [48–50], and typical range of van-der-Waals interaction is

about 1 nm, the relevant pore size on the adsorption would be around 1–2 nm. Therefore, the

meso pores (2–50 nm) would not aﬀect directly on the adsorption process while the increase

of speciﬁc surface area and pore volume would be eﬀective in this comparison.

About A-25 and S-25, the speciﬁc surface area and pore volume are larger than A-20, but

the measured adsorption performance looks not improved. A possible reason would be the
average pore diameter are too large to adsorb Xe atom, since the intensity of van-der-Waals

force is inversely proportional to the cube of distance.

5 Conclusion

We have carried out Rn adsorption measurements with ACFs using a newly developed test
bench at Kobe University, Japan. The radioactivity of the ACFs provided from UNITIKA
Ltd. was lower or comparable to that of the activated charcoals used in previous researches.

The measured radioactivity of A-20 for the uranium series was < 5.5 mBq/kg with 90%
conﬁdence level. In Air and Ar gas, ACF A-15 demonstrated an excellent adsorption eﬃciency

of 1/10000 reduction at maximum before the saturation of Rn adsorption, and more than
97% adsorption eﬃciency after the saturation. In Xe gas, the adsorption eﬃciency values are

lower than that in Air or Ar gas. We carried out a set of measurements on Rn adsorption

18

 
 
 
 
in Xe gas under various conditions, then estimated ACF’s basic performance of ﬂow rate,
concentration, and pressure dependence of the Rn adsorption ability in Xe gas. We also

observed some diﬀerence on Rn adsorption ability from diﬀerent ACF types. Among the
tested ACFs, A-20 has the best Rn adsorption ability. The observed Rn adsorption eﬃciency
was (33.6+2.1
−6.4) % (12 g of A-20, in atmospheric pressure Xe and 442.8 ± 0.8 Bq/m3 Rn). S-25,
A-25, and A-15 also show similar adsorption performance.
