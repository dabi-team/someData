Abstract—Guaranteeing fresh and reliable information for
augmented reality (AR) services is a key challenge to enable
a real-time experience and sustain a high quality of physical
experience (QoPE) for the users. In this paper, a terahertz (THz)
cellular network is used to exchange rate-hungry AR content.
For this network, guaranteeing an instantaneous low peak age
of information (PAoI) is necessary to overcome the uncertainty
stemming from the THz channel. In particular, a novel economic
concept, namely, the risk of ruin is proposed to examine the
probability of occurrence of rare, but extremely high PAoI that
can jeopardize the operation of the AR service. To assess the
severity of these hazards, the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of the PAoI is derived for two different scheduling policies.
This CDF is then used to ﬁnd the probability of maximum severity
of ruin PAoI. Furthermore, to provide long term insights about
the AR content’s age, the average PAoI of the overall system is also
derived. Simulation results show that an increase in the number
of users will positively impact the PAoI in both the expected and
worst-case scenarios. Meanwhile, an increase in the bandwidth
reduces the average PAoI but leads to a decline in the severity
of ruin performance. The results also show that a system with
preemptive last come ﬁrst served (LCFS) queues of limited size
buffers have a better ruin performance (12 % increase in the
probability of guaranteeing a less severe PAoI while increasing the
number of users), whereas ﬁrst come ﬁrst served (FCFS) queues
of limited buffers lead to a better average PAoI performance
(45 % lower PAoI as we increase the bandwidth).

I. INTRODUCTION

The emergence of wireless eXtended reality (XR) will yield
a radical paradigm shift from conventional network designs
aiming to fulﬁll a quality-of-service (QoS),
towards ones
targeting a new concept dubbed quality of physical experience
(QoPE) [1]. To maintain a high QoPE, the wireless network
should be capable of soliciting its users’ ﬁve senses. XR
encompasses augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and
mixed reality (MR) as shown in Fig. 1, whose applications
will offer a wide range of experiences with different goals.
On the virtual end of the spectrum, VR’s main goal is to
fully immerse the user in a virtual experience, whereas AR
aims to supplement reality with virtual objects. Henceforth, to
ensure immersion, XR services necessitate visual and haptic
requirements that are translated onto a wireless downlink
at high-rate and high-reliability low latency communications
(HRLLC) as investigated in [2]. Clearly,
to exchange XR
content at high rate on the downlink and uplink, it is natural

to adopt frequency bands beyond millimeter wave (mmWave),
making the communication at terahertz (THz) band necessary.
Nevertheless, an HRLLC downlink in AR would be serving
outdated requests if it is not supplemented with a call for fresh
information at the uplink. The freshness of this uplink informa-
tion determines the timeliness of AR requests to the server that
generates the AR experiences. Since AR will be used in critical
applications (e.g. Google Glass is expected to be heavily de-
ployed by numerous industries ranging from manufacturing all
the way to surgical operations [3]) a single disruption caused by
an extreme event, such as highly outdated/delayed uplink data
or an unusual trafﬁc pattern, can lead to substantial hazards. For
instance, an obsolete AR request in a biological lab translates
into a biohazard that poses threats to the lives of individuals or
the security of property. Thus, apart from disrupting the user’s
QoPE, outdated information in an AR network will lead to
tremendous faults and great risks. To address this challenge,
the freshness of information can be quantiﬁed by the concept of
age of information (AoI). For wireless AR users, AoI depends
on both the generation and transmission of AR content while
capturing the receiver information freshness. Moreover, given
that THz frequencies are necessary to transmit rate-hungry AR
content, it is imperative to understand whether an AR wireless
network over THz can sustain an instantaneous low AoI to
provide the user the promised QoPE.

A. Prior Works

The concept of AoI has recently seen a surge in literature
such as in [4]–[6]. In [4], the optimal control of information
updates from a source node to a destination was studied.
The work in [5] studied the problem of minimizing non-
uniform status packet sizes for IoT monitoring systems. The
authors in [6] examined the AoI timeliness metric through a
variety of queuing systems. Meanwhile, the concept of peak
age of information (PAoI) has been studied in [7]–[9]. In [7],

the authors characterized the average age and the PAoI for
different scheduling policies. The authors in [8] investigated the
expected PAoI expressions under different scheduling policies.
The work in [9] studies the tradeoff between frequency of status
updates and queuing delay. However, these works [4]–[9] do
not examine the behavior of AoI in providing fresh information
to critical and stringent XR applications. In fact, the works
in [4]–[9] do not examine the instantaneous aging process
necessary to deliver a real-time AR experience, thus, they do
not shed light on extreme events with a high AoI. Such events
lead to substantial risks in critical AR applications and require
a study of the risk of ruin, i.e., the likelihood of hazardous
damages caused by exceeding the PAoI measure. Such an
analysis is fundamentally important for a better understanding
of the uncertain THz channel.

The main contribution of this paper is a ruin-aware novel
performance analysis in terms of achievable average peak
AoI, worst-case AoI, and reliability for a cellular network
operating at THz frequencies and servicing AR users. The
is to assess how and when a THz network
ultimate goal
can deliver minimal peak AoI,
in terms of the THz data
rate, depending on the adopted network queuing policies. In
particular, we introduce a model for a wireless AR service
that is deployed using THz operated reconﬁgurable intelligent
surfaces (RISs). In the studied model, each AR user sends
a request
to an RIS with mobile edge computing (MEC)
capabilities, to solicit new AR content. Given the stringent
QoPE requirements of AR services and the uncertainty of the
THz channel, it is fundamental to examine the expected and
the “ruin” PAoI, which captures the worst-case information
obsoleteness. Subsequently, to guarantee that the PAoI does not
violate the QoPE we derive the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of the maximum severity of ruin, i.e., the distribution
characterizing the severity of PAoI exceedances. Moreover, we
derive the average PAoI to provide long term insights about
the AR response. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work
that analyzes the ruin oriented PAoI achieved by AR services
over a THz cellular network. Simulation results show that an
increase in the number of users positively impacts the PAoI
both in the expected and worst-case, while an increase in the
bandwidth reduces the average PAoI but leads to a decline in
the severity of ruin performance.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system
model and problem formulation are presented in Section II.
The ruin-oriented peak AoI analysis is performed in Section III.
Section IV presents the simulation results. Finally conclusions
are drawn in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

Consider the uplink1 of an RIS-based wireless network
in a conﬁned indoor area, servicing a set U of U mobile
wireless AR users via a set B of B RISs acting as THz
operated base stations (BSs). In particular, RISs are a scaled-up

scheme and is outside of the scope of this chapter

version of massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)
that supplement existing walls and structures with wireless
capabilities. Thus, RISs increase the likelihood of a near-
ﬁeld communications through a line-of-sight (LoS) path that
is fundamental for reliable THz communications2. Moreover,
the AR users are mobile and may change their locations and
orientations at any point in time. We consider continuous time
slots indexed by t with ﬁxed duration τ . Each RIS is a BS,
that is provided with a feeder (antenna) with a corresponding
transmit power denoted by p. Hence,
the transmitted data
is encoded onto the phases of the signals reﬂected from
different reconﬁgurable meta-surfaces that compose the RIS
[11]. Henceforth, if the RIS consists of N meta-surfaces whose
reﬂection phase can be optimized independently, then an N -
stream virtual MIMO system can be realized by using a single
radio frequency (RF) active chain [11]. We assume that the
RF source is close enough to the RIS surface so that the
transmission between each pair of RF source and RIS is not
affected by fading [11].

A. Wireless Capacity

We consider an arbitrary AR user u in U that is at a constant
distance dub from its respective RIS b. Moreover, as a byprod-
uct of directional beamforming, propagation differences, and
RIS deployment, the considered network will be noise limited.
Furthermore, deploying RISs enables the desired channel to
become a LoS channel [12]. Subsequently, to guarantee a LoS
link for every AR user, we assume that the RIS-AR user
association is performed by a centralized controller [13]. In
particular, the electromagnetic response of the N meta-surface
elements is programmed by generating input signals that tune
varactors and change the phase of the reﬂected signal [14].
Let Θub,t = [θubn,t]N ×1 be the phase shift vector of RIS b ,
with respect to user equipment (UE) u, at time slot t, where
θubn,t ∈ Θ, n is the index corresponding to the meta-surface
of each RIS, and Θ = {−π + 2kπ
K−1 |k = 0, 1, ..., K − 1}.
K is the number of possible phase shifts per meta-surface
element. Thus, the random channel gain between AR UE u at
time slot t is given by [2]: hub,t = (cid:0)
(cid:1)2(cid:0)e−k(f )dub,t(cid:1)2
,
where k(f ) is the overall molecular absorption coefﬁcient of
the medium at the THz band, and f is the operating frequency.
Let ψubn,t be the phase shift vector between AR UE u and
the metasurface n of RIS b at time t. Since the coherence
bandwidth at THz is inherently large due to the delay spread
and temporal broadening effects as shown in [15] and [16],
we can assume that
the rate shows an invariant behavior
across the THz bandwidth for all the distances considered.
Hence, for a given reﬂection phase shift vector, θub,t, the
transmission rate from AR UE u to RIS b will be (under a
an approximate average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) value across the THz band):

existing walls and structures at a close proximity of the users.

association is equal to ψubn,t, thus maximizing the rate rub,t,
as shown in [11].

Furthermore, the rate of AR content transmission over the
THz link between AR user u and RIS b, assuming a constant
image size M , is given by: rub,t = Rub,t
M .

B. Age of Information

t , where U B
t

The AoI is a key performance metric to quantify the
freshness of the status information update at
the receiver
deﬁned as the time elapsed since the most recent AR content
update delivered at the MEC server. By deﬁnition, the AoI
at the receiver at the beginning of time slot t is given by:
Aub,t = t − U B
is the time stamp of the freshest
AR content update that was delivered to the RIS before t.
Moreover, while the use of average AoI as a freshness metric
might guarantee a good performance on the long run, for real-
time applications such as AR, it is necessary to examine the
instantaneous aging of information, so as to, capture real-time
disruptions to the AR experience. Subsequently, our interest
lies in evaluating the distribution of the PAoI and its worst-case
performance. In [18], the authors have shown that the AoI is
minimized when the queuing follows a last come ﬁrst served
(LCFS) scheme in contrast to an FCFS scheme, also, an LCFS
with preemption performed better than an LCFS scheduling
without preemption. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is true for
queuing schemes with one source, or when all the transmitters
are sending out status updates about the same situation. In
other words, the freshest update among all sources is always
the most desirable update to the receiver. Also, this analysis
was solely based on average AoI values and overlooked the
instantaneous performance.

In our model, while one user is immersed into one AR
session and needs to convey its freshest information to the
MEC server, another AR user might be undergoing the same
process. On the one hand, we need to ensure a fair scheduling
among users and deliver every request freshly to the server,
thus, doing so with an FCFS queue allows this process. On
the other hand, in case the user needs to urgently deliver a
new request, it would be best for the server to ignore the
previous requests coming from that user and respond to the
most recent one. For example, in a manufacturing plant, if
an AR user commits a fault and needs an urgent AR content
assistance in solving the situation, an LCFS queuing policy
would be the most appropriate for this situation. Otherwise,
not only outdated information will be sent, but risk-inducing
outdated information will be sent to the AR user. Therefore, to
scrutinize this problem, we propose to split the queuing system
into two as shown in Fig. 2. Splitting the queuing system

Fig. 2: Illustrative example of our queuing model

allows us to diagnose the complex scheduling situation and
to characterize the freshness of the information as a function
of fair and priority scheduling policies. Here, similar to [6] and
[19], we assume that the AR update arrivals are modeled as a
independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Poisson point
process (PPP) with temporal mean rate rub = E [rub,t]. These
AR updates are processed and halted in limited sized M/M/1/x
queues (x is the buffer size) and then sent to a common FCFS
queue, where a new AR content is generated as a response
to the status update. Such limited sized queues that provide
halting allow us to inject a sense of prioritization to users
without leading to an unfair scheduling policy as in with a
complete LCFS queue, i.e., priority only when necessary.

According to Burke’s Theorem [20], when the service rate
is larger than the arrival rate for an M/M/1 queue, then the
departure process at steady state is a Poisson process with
the same arrival rate. Hence, the arrival of requests to QC
also follows a Poisson process with rate λC = (cid:80)U
u=1 µu,
where µU is the service rate of each limited buffer sized
queue. We also assume that the computing follows a Markovian
process and thus, Qc is an M/M/1 queue with service rate
µC. Next, we will analyze two types of limited sized queues
with different dynamics and buffers. Given the risks pertaining
to outdated AR requests, we use a ﬁnancial concept,
the
risk of ruin, deﬁned as an insurer’s likelihood of losing an
investment capital [21] and apply it to critical AR requests
to characterize the likelihood of hazardous damages based on
the aging process. In particular, we derive the ruin of going
above a PAoI threshold set for this network and the CDF of
maximum severity of ruin. We then compare this ruin-oriented
result performance to the average PAoI performance.
III. RUIN-ORIENTED PEAK AOI ANALYSIS
In this section, we examine the instantaneous PAoI and use
it to derive the probability of ruin of PAoI. Furthermore, we
evaluate the average PAoI pertaining to the overall queuing
system and compare its performance to the worst-case PAoI,
hence shedding light on the complimentarity of their insights
and necessity of both average and tail analyses.
A. Instantaneous and Ruin AoI

Here, we analyze the performance of the peak AoI of AR
generated content at THz frequency with respect to a limited
size FCFS M/M/1/2 queue and an LCFS M/M/1/2* queue,
which allows preemption only in waiting, i.e., once an AR
content is sent to the computing queue it cannot be preempted.
These two types will be evaluated based on the ruin of peak

AoI and its maximum severity.

Hereinafter, the term reliability is deﬁned as the ability of
the THz network to maintain low PAoI. Moreover, analyzing
the reliability of the network in terms of PAoI needs to
be performed instantaneously and needs to account for the
extreme events that will violate the QoPE target performance.
In the light of this, we propose a novel notion of ruin-based
reliability analysis developed using notions from the powerful
actuarial sciences and economics framework [21]–[23]. From
economics, the probability of ruin in ﬁnite time is deﬁned as:

Ψ(u, t) = Pr(U (s) < 0

for some s, 0 < s ≤ t),

where U (s) = u + ct − S(s), u is the insurer’s surplus
time 0 and c is the insurer’s rate of premium income
at
per unit time, which we assume to be received continuously.
Thus, Ψ(u, t) is the probability that the insurer’s surplus falls
below zero at some time in the future, i.e., the claims outgo
exceeds the initial surplus plus premium income. This is a
probability of ruin in continuous time, we can similarly deﬁne a
discrete time ultimate ruin probability. Moreover, the insurer’s
surplus in the ﬁnancial domain, translates onto reliability in
a wireless network. Moreover, a duality exists between the
queuing dynamics of an M/G/1 queue and the risk of ruin as
shown in [22]. Elaborating on this duality, we can deﬁne the
system reliability in terms of PAoI and let Ψ(u, t) characterize
its CDF. Subsequently, we will ﬁnd this distribution and use
it to derive the maximum severity of ruin for each one of the
scheduling schemes considered.

rub+µu

We ﬁrst evaluate the probability distribution function (PDF)
of the peak AoI for both scheduling conﬁgurations. To do
so, we deﬁne P (ν) = µu
as the steady state probability
as the system is empty, this probability is used to compute
the peak AoI PDF, whose conditional is given by: Φ(a|ν) =
Φ(τ |ν) ∗ Φ(y|ν), where a denotes the value of peak AoI , τ is
the time spent in the system, and y is the interdeparture time.
Thus, knowing the conditional PDFs from [7], we can write
the marginal PDF by using Bayes’ theorem as follows:

ΦF (a) = ΦF (a|ν)P (ν) + ΦF (a|¯ν)P (¯ν),

Following a similar procedure for the M/M/1/2* queue, the
peak AoI PDF of each queue is given by:

ΦL(a) = ΦL(a|ν)P (ν) + ΦL(a|¯ν)P (¯ν),

Henceforth, to examine the worst-case scenario, i.e., the great-
est AoI peak, we consider the maximum severity of ruin given
the one-to-one relation between any M/G/1 system and a
ruin probability.3 Thus, the ruin characterization of system
reliability allows us to capture the effect of extreme events
on the immersive real-time response. In other words,
the
maximum severity of ruin characterizes the severity of the
worst peak QoPE of the AR user. Next, we derive the CDF of
the maximum severity of PAoI ruin.
Theorem 1. The CDF characterizing the maximum severity of
PAoI, for a PAoI threshold of z is given by:

JF (z) = P r (MF ≤ z|a < ∞) =

JL(z) = P r (ML ≤ z|a < ∞) =

ΨF (a) − ΨF (a + z)
ΨF (a)(1 − ΨF (z))
ΨL(a) − ΨL(a + z)
ΨL(a)(1 − ΨL(z))

, (3)

. (4)

where ΨF (a) is the CDF of PAoI over M/M/1/2 FCFS queues
scheduling policies, ΨL(a) is the CDF of PAoI over M/M/1/2*
LCFS queues scheduling policies, MF = sup {AF (t)|a < ∞},
ML = sup {AL(t)|a < ∞}, AF (t) is the peak AoI experienced
at time t over M/M/1/2 FCFS queues scheduling policies, and
AL(t) is the peak AoI experienced at time t over M/M/1/2*
LCFS queues scheduling policies. Thus, MF and ML are the
worst-case peak AoI for each case.
Proof: See Appendix A

This result allows us to tractably assess the conditions during
which worst-case PAoIs will not exceed a worst-case threshold
z. The CDFs of both scheduling policies is a function of
the THz data rate and the queuing service rate. As long as
the maximum severity of ruin PAoI is maintained below z, a
reliable, real-time response will be provided to the AR user
and the QoPE will not be violated in extreme events.
B. Average Peak AoI

In addition to the severity of ruin computed for the limited
buffer size queues, we evaluate the average end-to-end (E2E)
peak AoI of our system. Given that Qc is an M/M/1 queue,
the average peak AoI can be given by [24]: ˆAc = 1

pertaining to a fair non extreme scenario. Moreover, here we
also consider the computing queue in the aging process to
provide us with the E2E aging peak. Next, in our simulation
results, we compare the two suggested schemes and contrast
the differences in their behavior from an expected and worst-
case viewpoint.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
For our simulations, we consider the following parameters:
T0 = 300 K, p = 1 W, M = 10 Mbits, f = 1 THz,
W = 10 GHz, K(f ) = 0.0016 m−1 with 1% of water vapor
molecules as in [25] and we have chosen µi = 5 packets/s
µc = 100 packets/s these values are chosen to comply with
existing AR processing units such as the GEFORCE RTX 2080
Ti [26]. The RISs are deployed over the 4 walls of an indoor
area modeled as a square of size 50 m × 50 m.

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the effect of the density of users
on the freshness of information. We can see in Fig. 3 that the
peak average AoI monotonically decreases with the number of
users in the area. This is due to the fact that more packets are
arriving simultaneously bringing fresher information into the
network’s server. In contrast to a typical E2E delay analysis,
an increase in the number of users would degrade the E2E
delay, while it improves the age as shown here. Moreover, the
FCFS M/M/1/2 queue’s average PAoI is 35 % lower than the
LCFS M/M/1/2* queue for all densities. The gap between the
two schemes increases as the number of users increases.

Moreover, in Fig. 4, we evaluate the distribution of worst-
case peak AoI below a threshold, where the threshold is
set to z = 3. This threshold was set based on the range
of average PAoI to contrast ruin behaviors to the expected
one. Here, the number of users also positively impacts the
performance, as the probability of the worst-case peak AoI
below z, is increasing with the number of users. Thus, as
the density of users increases, the worst-case performance is
further guaranteed to be below z = 3. Nevertheless, even
though the LCFS M/M/1/2* queue had a higher average peak
AoI, it is shown here that it performs 12 % better in terms of
worst-case performance, and thus provides fresher information
during extreme and dynamic events when the number of users
increases. In particular, LCFS allow AR users to deliver their
more urgent requests while preempting their previous requests.

Fig. 4: Probability of worst-case peak AoI below z = 3 versus
number of users.
This is especially useful during extreme events, that might
delay urgent requests given that is incurring more latency to
process the previous requests, and leading LCFS M/M/1/2*
queue will alleviate this issue.

Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the prominent effect of the bandwidth
on the freshness of information, for U = 15 users. We can see
in Fig. 5 that the peak average AoI monotonically decreases
with a higher bandwidth, this also corresponds to the fact
that a higher number packets is arriving per unit time, thus
ensuring information at the network’s server. In here, the FCFS
M/M/1/2 queue’s average peak AoI is 45 % lower than the
LCFS M/M/1/2* queue for all values of the bandwidth. The gap
between the two schemes increases as the bandwidth increases.
Moreover, in Fig.6 we evaluate the distribution of worst-
case peak AoI, where the threshold is set to z = 3. Here,
and in contrast to the scenario of users density, the increase
in bandwidth negatively impacts the ruin performance, i.e., the
probability of a worst-case peak AoI below z, is decreasing as
the bandwidth increases. Clearly, a higher bandwidth changes
the frequency range of THz, thus, implying complications in
terms of molecular absorption effect and range of operation,
ﬁnally leading to extreme events with negative impact. Hence-
forth, increasing the bandwidth will increase the data rate and
improve the performance of peak AoI on average but will shift
the worst-case peak AoI to higher values. Here also, similarly
to the density of the users, the LCFS behaves better in terms
of extreme events, but worse in terms of average peak AoI
performance.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the AoI of AR services
in a THz cellular network employing RISs as its BSs. We
have performed a novel ruin-aware performance analysis that
scrutinizes the PAoI during extreme events. After deriving the
PAoI CDFs, we have used it to ﬁnd the CDF of the maximum
severity of ruin for different scheduling policies. Moreover, we
have also derived the average PAoI for our considered model
and compared the ruin performance analysis to the average
PAoI and contrasted the differences in the behavior. While
introducing LCFS preempting limited sized queues improved
the ruin performance, FCFS limited sized queues improved the
average PAoI performance.

APPENDIX

Proof: Given that the maximum severity of ruin is a
function of the CDF of ruin, we ﬁrst need to integrate the
results in (1) and (2). After some mathematical manipulations,
we obtain the CDFs for the FCFS M/M/1/2 queue and the
LCFS M/M/1/2* respectively:

ϕF (a) = 1 −

Moreover, given that the AR updates are i.i.d., the CDF of the
AoI at the end of all limited buffer sized queues is given by:

ΨF (a) = (ϕF (a))u ,

ΨL(a) = (ϕL(a))u .

(9)

Hence, the distribution of the maximum severity of ruin in
each case can be given according to its deﬁnition in [21] by
the result in (3) and (4) in Theorem 1.
