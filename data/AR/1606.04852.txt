Abstract:

Discrepancies between the measured and simulated gain in Thick Micropatterned gaseous

detectors (MPGD), namely THGEM, have been observed by several groups. In order to
simulate the electron avalanches and the gain the community relies on the calculations per-
formed in Garﬁeld++, known to produce diﬀerences of 2 orders of magnitude in comparison
to the experimental data for thick MPGDs.

In this work, simulations performed for Ne/5%CH4, Ar/5%CH4 and Ar/30%CO2 mix-
tures shows that Garﬁeld++ is able to perfectly describe the experimental data if Penning
eﬀect is included in the simulation. The comparison between the number of excitations
which may lead to a Penning transfer, is shown for THGEM and GEM, explaining the less
pronounced gain discrepancies observed in GEM.

The main software tool used for the gas gain simulation in Micropatterned Gaseous Detec-
tors (MPGDs) is Garﬁeld++ [1], a powerful toolkit for the detailed simulation of gaseous
detectors and the physical processes occurring on it. It uses Monte Carlo microscopic tech-
nique to track electrons in gases on a molecular level, retrieving information about each
excited atom: the (x,y,z) position, the time of production and the excitation level [2]. The
main drawback of using Garﬁeld++ for gain simulations in Thick Gas Electron Multiplier
(THGEM) [3] has been the lower gain obtained when compared with the experimental data,
reaching up to 2 orders of magnitude less for measured gains of about 105 (see Figure 1).
Such discrepancies were generally assumed to be related with the electric ﬁeld calculation
by the ﬁnite-elements software or the charging-up of the insulator foils. However, recent
results in simulations [4, 5] and experimental data [6] of charging-up in GEM and THGEM
have showed that the gain variation due to the insulator charging-up is in the order of a
few tens of %, not explaining the 2 orders of magnitude diﬀerence. In this work, due to the
long calculation time and complexity, charging-up eﬀects were not considered.

One of the input parameters allowed by Garﬁeld++ is the Penning fractions for the gas
mixtures, an option which is not often used by users since the data on Penning fractions is
sparse and not reliable. The Penning eﬀect occurs in gas mixtures when the energy of an
excited atom is higher than the ionization potential of the admixture gas (quencher). If a
collision between them occurs, energy transfers are possible resulting in an extra electron
[7]. Recently, very detailed and exhaustive studies have been carried out in Penning transfer
namely in argon and neon mixtures [7–9].

Our hypothesis is that the Garﬁeld++ gain deﬁcit is due to the non-inclusion of Penning
eﬀect in the calculations performed by users. In this work we will evaluate Garﬁeld++’s
performance in the thick MPGDs gain calculations by including/excluding the Penning
eﬀect and comparing them to experimental data.

2 Method

In this work a 0.4 mm thickness (t) THGEM was simulated. The hole diameter (d) was
set to 3 mm with a 0.1 mm rim (rim) and a 0.7 mm pitch (p) being the unitary cell shown
in Figure 1. Garﬁeld++’s input electric ﬁelds were calculated using Elmer [12], a ﬁnite
elements electrostatics calculation software, while Gmsh [10, 11], was used as mesh generator
for Elmer.

Figure 1. Unitary cell used for the THGEM gain calculations. t = 0.4 mm, p = 0.7 mm, d = 0.3 mm,
rim = 0.1 mm.

Calculations in Ne/5%CH4, Ar/5%CH4 and Ar/30%CO2 were performed with and
without the inclusion of Penning transfers. Every time the Penning transfers were con-
sidered, its rates were set to r = 0.4, r = 0.18 [8] and r = 0.57 [7] respectively to the above
listed mixtures.

Two other MPGDs were simulated: the Thick WELL (THWELL) [13, 14] (thick-
ness = 0.4 mm, hole diameter = 0.5 mm, rim = 0.1 mm and pitch = 1.0 mm) in Ne/5%CH4
and a regular GEM (thickness = 0.05 mm, biconical hole diameter = 0.07/0.05 mm, rim = 0.08 mm
and pitch = 0.140 mm) in Ar/30%CO2. In this case, the Garﬁeld++’s input electric ﬁelds
were calculated by ANSYS® [15].

For all the cases, the drift and induction regions were set to 5 mm and 2 mm, with

electric ﬁelds set to 500V/cm and 2000 V/cm, respectively.

Gas pressure and temperature were considered to be at 760 Torr and 20 °C. For each
condition 1000 events were calculated. The gain was assumed to be the average number of
electrons produced in the gas per drift electron, i.e., the absolute gain.

3 Results and discussion

Figure 2(a) shows the results of Garﬁeld++’s gain calculations for a 0.4 mm THGEM
operating in Ne/5%CH4, Ar/5%CH4 and Ar/30%CO2 when Penning transfers are not con-
sidered. For comparison, experimental data for the same THGEM geometry is also shown.

The previously described eﬀect, i.e., the lower calculated gain relatively to the experi-
mental data, is clearly observed. The discrepancies increase with the gain, reaching 2 orders
of magnitude when the experimental gains approach 105.

data adapted from [16, 17] while dots are the simulated data. (a) Penning transfers not considered.
(b) Penning transfers considered. Error bars are not visible as they are smaller than the dot size.

Calculations for the same gas mixtures were also performed considering Penning trans-
fers. For Ar/5%CH4 a transfer rate r = 0.18 taken from [8] was used while for Ar/30%CO2
a value of r = 0.57 was set [7]. The value used for Ne/5%CH4 is empirical due to the lack of
data and was chosen by performing preliminary tests. The results are plotted in Figure 2(b).
Comparing the data of Figure 2(a) with that of Figure 2(b) we can observe an im-
provement of the agreement between experimental and simulated data. For Ar/5%CH4 we
can observe a good match showing that Garﬁeld++ is able to describe the THGEM gain
in this mixture. For Ar/30%CO2the simulated gain is in good agreement with the experi-
mental one until it reaches a value of 500. After that value the simulation results slightly
diverge from the experimental data presenting a deviation by a factor of 2 when the gain
reaches 2·104. Such diﬀerence is explained in [7] as being due to photon feedback (electrons
extracted from the cathode or CO2 ionization by the scintillation photons), which was not
included in the simulation.
In the case of Ne/5%CH4 we can observe a small deviation
between the calculations and the experimental data both for low and high gains. The fact
that for low gains the calculations present higher values let us consider that maybe, the
r = 0.4 value could be an overestimation. By other side, when considering the methodology
in ref [17] we may think that this measurement can have not enough precision (at low gains)
for a good estimation on the Penning transfer rates. When looking at high gains we can
observe a slightly lower values for calculations relatively to the experimental values. In this
case there are two possibilities: or the Penning rate is underestimated, or the most probable
in our opinion: photon feedback process should be considered, as described in ref [19]. We

A precise
work should be done in order to get a concise value.

In order to conﬁrm that the gain discrepancy is not caused by the choice of ﬁnite element
software or multiplier structure, the same calculations were carried out for a THWELL mul-
tiplier and using ANSYS® software. The results are presented in Figure 3 for a Ne/5%CH4
mixture with and without considering Penning transfers. The diﬀerence between the exper-
imental and calculated data when no Penning transfers are considered is clearly observed.
However, when a Penning transfer
rate of r = 0.4 is included, the experimental data is
in good agreement with the simulation, showing that Garﬁeld++ is able to perform gain
calculations in thick multipliers, accurately modelling the experimental results.

simulated data. Error bars are not visible as they are smaller than the dot size.

Figure 4(a) shows Garﬁeld++ gain calculations for GEM and THGEM in a mixture of
Ar/30%CO2, excluding (closed dots) and including (open dots) the Penning transfers. As
can be observed, in GEMs the Penning eﬀect in the gain discrepancies is less pronounced.
In order to understand this eﬀect we have at look to Garﬁeld++ results keeping in mind
that the extra ionization in the gas comes from the excited argon atoms that transfer the
energy to CO2 ionizing it. The result is shown in Figure 4(b), where we have observed a
higher number of excitations in THGEM than in GEM, explaining why the diﬀerences in
gain is lower in GEM than in THGEM when Penning transfers are not considered.

4 Conclusions

Experimental gain measurements in THGEM and THWELL were successfully modelled by
using Garﬁeld++, taking into consideration the Penning transfer rates in the simulation.
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were not observed in the results when using diﬀerent ﬁnite elements
software in the calculation of electric ﬁelds, thereby excluding this cause for the mismatch
between experimental and simulated data.

the dot size.

A Penning transfer rate of r = 0.4 was estimated for a Ne/5%CH4, however, for this

case a more detailed study should be performed.

We have also observed a stronger eﬀect of the Penning transfers in THGEM than in
GEM. This fact is due to the higher ratio of excitations in THGEM than in GEM. In any
case, for correct assessment of the MPGD gains, Penning transfer rates should always be
considered.
