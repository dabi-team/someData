ABSTRACT
In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of subarcsecond blobs in
In AR 12149, a C5.5 circular-ribbon ﬂare occurred at ∼04:55 UT on
coronal jets.
2014 August 24, which consisted of a discrete circular ribbon and a short inner ribbon
inside. Two jets (jet1 and jet2) were related to the ﬂare. Jet1 appeared ﬁrst and
experienced untwisting motion during its early propagation along a closed coronal loop.
Jet2 appeared 6 minutes later and propagated upward along another closed loop. During
its initial phase, a big plasmoid was ejected out of jet2 at a speed of ∼150 km s−1.
After the ﬂare peak time (05:02 UT), multiple bright and compact blobs appeared in
the lower part of jet2, which were observed by the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) on board
the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The blobs observed by SJI in 1330 ˚A have
sizes of 0.′′45−1.′′35, nearly 84% of which are subarcsecond (<1′′). The mean value
and standard deviation of the sizes are 0.′′78 and 0.′′19, respectively. The velocities
of the blobs range from 10 to more than 220 km s−1, some of which decelerate and
disappear during the upward propagation. Three of the blobs had their counterparts in
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft. The velocities are almost
identical in ultraviolet (UV) and EUV wavelengths. We propose that the blobs observed
in 1330 ˚A are the cool component (∼0.025 MK), while the blobs observed in EUV are
the hot component of several MK. In jet1, only one blob was present with a size of
∼1′′and a velocity of ∼40 km s−1. We conclude that the blobs are created by the
tearing-mode instability of the current sheet at the base or inside the coronal jets.
Our results have important implication for uncovering the ﬁne structures of coronal
jets and understanding the relationship between the blobs observed in UV and EUV
wavelengths.

1. INTRODUCTION

Jet-like eruptions are prevalent in the solar
atmosphere, such as spicules (De Pontieu et al.
2007), Hα surges (Canﬁeld et al. 1996), chro-
mospheric jets (Tian et al. 2014), and coronal
jets (Shibata et al. 1992). Coronal
jets are
transient collimated outﬂows of hot plasma
in the solar corona, which are associated with
ﬂares or microﬂares at the base (Raouaﬁ et al.
2016). Coronal jets are observed in the extreme-
ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) wave-
lengths (Shimojo et al. 1996; Innes et al. 2016;
Zhang et al. 2017). According to the diﬀerent
morphology of jets, they are previously classi-
ﬁed into the anemone jets (Yokoyama & Shibata
1996) and two-sided jets (Tian et al. 2017;
Zheng et al. 2018). The temperatures of the jet
main body are a few MK (Shimojo & Shibata
2000), while the temperatures of the jet base can
reach up to tens of MK (Bain & Fletcher 2009).
The electron densities of jets are 0.7−4.0×109
cm−3 with a mean value of 1.7×109 cm−3.
The apparent widths and heights of jets are
5−100 Mm and 10−400 Mm, respectively. The
velocities are 10−1000 km s−1 with a mean
value of 200 km s−1 (Shimojo & Shibata 2000).
The magnetic ﬁeld strength of the jets are a
few Gauss (Pucci et al. 2013). The lifetimes
of jets range from 10 to 70 minutes, with a
median value of 20−40 minutes (Nistic`o et al.
jets tend to reoccur from
2009).
the same region, which are called homolo-
gous jets (Madjarska 2011; Madjarska et al.
2012; Huang et al. 2012; Mulay et al. 2017).
Apart from the radial motion, they occasion-
ally experience swirling or untwisting motion
(Zhang & Ji 2014a).

Coronal

It is generally accepted that coronal jets result
from impulsive release of magnetic free energy
via magnetic reconnection. Numerical simula-
tions and observations suggest that several trig-
gering mechanisms of jets are at work, such as
magnetic ﬂux emergence (Yokoyama & Shibata

1995; Moreno-Insertis et al. 2008), magnetic
cancellation (Chifor et al. 2008; Panesar et al.
2016), mini-ﬁlament eruption (Sterling et al.
2015; Hong et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2017; Wyper et al.
2018), and photospheric rotation (Pariat et al.
2009). Moore et al. (2010) classiﬁed the coro-
nal jets into two types, the standard type and
blowout type. The standard jets origin from
magnetic reconnection between the emerging
magnetic ﬁeld and the preexisiting coronal ﬁeld
(Pucci et al. 2013), while the blowout jets come
from the miniﬁlament eruptions (Li et al. 2015;
Shen et al. 2017).

tearing-mode instability (TMI)

The generation of magnetic islands (or called
plasmoids) in a thin current sheet as a re-
sult of
(or
called plasmoid instability) has been pre-
dicted in theory (Furth et al. 1963; Biskamp
2000) and extensively investigated in numeri-
cal simulations (e.g., Bhattacharjee et al. 2009;
Shen et al. 2011; Mei et al. 2012; Ni et al.
2012a). The creation and cascade of mag-
netic islands facilitate the magnetic recon-
nection rate and speed up the diﬀusion of
magnetic energy (Bhattacharjee et al. 2009;
Huang & Bhattacharjee 2010; Ni et al. 2015).
Numerical simulations and theoretical analy-
sis have proven that plasmoid instability sets
in when the Lundquist number (S) exceeds the
critical value (Sc = 103−104) (Bhattacharjee et al.
2009; Huang & Bhattacharjee 2010, 2012; Ni et al.
2010, 2012b, 2013; Comisso et al. 2016; Huang et al.
2017).
Above the solar photosphere,
Lundquist number is usually 106−1014 (Priest & Forbes
2000). Therefore, plasmoid instability is ex-
pected to occur frequently in the solar erup-
tions, which are related to magnetic recon-
nection (Karpen et al. 2012). Discrete and
intermittent plasmoids are observed in the
long current sheet behind coronal mass ejec-
tions (CMEs) (e.g., Ohyama & Shibata 1998;
Ko et al. 2003; Asai et al. 2004; Lin et al.
2005; Takasao et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2013;

Kumar & Cho 2013; Cheng et al. 2018). In the
chromospheric anemone jets, recurring plas-
moids with a size of ∼0.1 Mm are reported by
Singh et al. (2012) and excellently reproduced
by the numerical simulations (Yang et al. 2013).
Recently, intermittent plasmoids are detected in
ultraviolet (UV) bursts (Rouppe van der Voort et al.
2017). The highly dynamic features (≤0.′′2)
have line of sight velocities of ∼40 km s−1 and a
lifetime of orders of seconds. The plasmoid cas-
cading theory and numerical simulations indi-
cate that the high-order plasmoids with a length
scale of ion inertial length of ∼1 m can appear
in the reconnection process (Shibata & Tanuma
2001; Ni et al. 2015; Ni & Lukin 2018). How-
ever, the smaller plasmoids with a length scale
of 0.′′1 have not been observed due to the limited
spatial resolutions and time cadences of solar
telescopes.

Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014),
Zhang & Zhang (2017) investigated the bidi-
rectionally moving blobs that originate from
the junction between the spire and the arc-base
of a jet. However, the relationship between the
blobs observed in UV and EUV wavelengths is
not fully addressed. In this paper, we report our
multiwavelength observations of the subarcsec-
ond blobs in coronal jets associated with a C5.5
circular-ribbon ﬂare (CRF) on 2014 August 24.
As its name implies, the ribbons of CRFs have
circular or quasi-circular shapes (Zhang et al.
2015, 2016b,c; Li et al. 2018). The paper is
structured as follows. Data analysis is described
in Section 2. Results are shown in Section 3.
In Section 4, we compare our ﬁndings with
previous works.
In Section 5, we give a brief
summary of the results and draw a conclusion.

boundary.
(2016a) reported the observations of multiple
blobs embedded in recurring jets propagating
along a large-scale closed loop in the quiet re-
gion. The bright and compact features have
a size of 1.5−3 Mm, temperature of 1.8−3.1
MK, electron density of 1.7−2.8×109 cm−3, a
lifetime of 24−60 s, and a velocity of 120−450
km s−1. The authors proposed that the blobs
are plasmoids created by TMI of the current
sheet and propagate along the jets, which is
justiﬁed by state-of-the-art 3D numerical sim-
ulations (Wyper et al. 2016). Ni et al. (2017)
explored in detail the blob formation and ejec-
tion in coronal jets. It is found that, in addition
to TMI, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI)
can also create blob-like vortex features in coro-
nal jets when the plasma beta is relatively high
(Zhao et al. 2018).

2. INSTRUMENTS AND DATA ANALYSIS

The C5.5 ﬂare taking place in NOAA AR
12149 (N10E44) was observed by the Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) spacecraft. AIA
takes full-disk images in UV (1600 and 1700 ˚A)
and EUV (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335
˚A) wavelengths. The AIA level 1 data were
calibrated using the standard Solar Software
(SSW ) programs aia prep.pro. Compared with
AIA, the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of the Slit-Jaw
Imager (SJI) on board IRIS is much smaller,
being 126′′×129′′. SJI observed the ﬂare and
jets in 1330 ˚A, which includes two C II lines at
1335 ˚A and 1336 ˚A formed in the upper chromo-
sphere (T ≈ 0.025 MK). The IRIS /SJI level 2
data were directly used and coaligned with the
AIA images using the cross correlation method.
SXR ﬂuxes of the ﬂare in 0.5−4 ˚A and 1−8 ˚A
were recorded by the GOES spacecraft. The
observational parameters, including the instru-
ment, wavelength, time cadence, and pixel size
are summarized in Table 1.

3. RESULTS

3.1. C5.5 ﬂare and double jets

Figure 1 shows the GOES SXR light curves
of the C5.5 ﬂare. It is clear that the SXR ﬂuxes
increase very slowly during 04:30−04:55 UT. In
the impulsive phase, the ﬂuxes rise rapidly to
the peak values around 05:02 UT, which is fol-
lowed by a gradual decay phase until ∼05:25
UT. The lifetime of the ﬂare is ∼30 minutes.

In Figure 2, the evolution of the ﬂare is illus-
trated by eight snapshots of the AIA images in
193 ˚A (see also the online movie CRF193.mov ).
In the preﬂare phase before 04:55 UT, there
was no signiﬁcant brightening in AR 12149 (see
panel (a)). At the very beginning of the im-
pulsive phase, a twisted jet (jet1) spurted out

of the AR (see panel (b)). About four minutes
later, the jet (jet1) rotated and propagated fur-
ther and higher along a closed coronal loop in
the northeast direction. Meanwhile, the EUV
intensities of the ﬂare ribbons at the jet base,
including the circular ribbon (CR) and inner
ribbon (IR), reached their maxima (see panel
(c)). The diameter of CR is ∼1′. The short
and bright IR is surrounded by the thin and
fragmented CR, implying a magnetic null point
(B = 0) above the CRF and the correspond-
ing fan-spine topology (e.g., Zhang et al. 2012,
2015). Interestingly, a second slender jet (jet2)
appeared and propagated northwards near the
ﬂare peak time (see panel (d)). Like jet1, jet2
propagated along a large-scale closed coronal
loop (see panel (e)). Afterwards, jet1 and jet2
darkened and disappeared sequentially till 05:15
UT (see panel (g)). The post-ﬂare loops (PFLs)
cooled down and faded out gradually in the de-
cay phase (see panel (h)).

In Figure 3, the evolution of the ﬂare is il-
lustrated by eight snapshots of the IRIS /SJI
images in 1330 ˚A (see also the online movie
CRF1330.mov ). Due to the limited FOV of
SJI, only the eastern part of CR and lower part
of the jets are visible (see panel (c)). Like
in EUV wavelengths, IR is the brightest fea-
ture surrounded by the CR. Interestingly, re-
mote brightening (RB) appeared east to the
CR, which is enclosed by a small circle (see
panel (c)). EUV observations indicate that the
RB and CRF is connected by a closed coronal
loop along which jet1 propagates. Owing to the
higher resolution of IRIS, the double jets (jet1
and jet2) show more details than those in EUV
wavelengths.

3.2. Blobs in jet2

Figure 4 demonstrates twelve closeups of jet2
in 1330 ˚A during 05:02−05:08 UT. The FOV
(25′′×50′′) is signiﬁed by the white rectangle
in Figure 3(f). The most prominent features
are the tiny, bright, and compact blobs pointed

by the white arrows (see also the online movie
blob.mov ). At any time, there are multiple
blobs moving upward. Some disappeared within
a short period of time and new blobs appeared.
Three blobs (blob2, blob3, and blob4) with
larger sizes are identiﬁed and tracked by follow-
ing the gravitational centers of the blobs, which
are deﬁned as the intensity-weighted average
heights. The temporal evolutions of the heights
are displayed with green, cyan, and magenta
lines in Figure 5. Blob2 and blob3 moved so fast
that they left the FOV of SJI after 05:03:00 UT.
The velocities of blob2 and blob3 are 222±30
and 121±20 km s−1 in the FOV of SJI. Blob4
was formed at a relatively lower altitude and
moved slower than blob2 and blob3. Therefore,
we can track blob4 for a longer time. The tem-
poral evolution of the velocity of blob4 is plotted
with a red line in Figure 5. It is clear that the
velocity decreased quickly from the initial value
of ∼130 km s−1 to 20−40 km s−1 in the later
phase.

Interestingly, we found multiple blobs in jet2
observed by AIA. The EUV images around
05:02:45 UT are displayed in Figure 6.
In
each panel, four bright and compact blobs could
be recognized and labeled with blob1, blob2,
blob3, and blob4. The diameters of the blobs
(∼4.′′14, ∼2.′′86, ∼2.′′23, and ∼2.′′80) are close
to the sizes reported in previous literatures
(Zhang & Ji 2014b; Zhang et al. 2016a).

In order to track the propagations of the
blobs, twelve closeups of jet2 in 171 ˚A during
05:02−05:05 UT are displayed in Figure 7. It is
evident that blob1 was created at the highest al-
titude and moved upward at a speed of 180±18
km s−1. Probably due to the higher tempera-
ture and absence of cool plasmas, the formation
and propagation of blob1 were not captured by
SJI. Compared with blob1, blob2 was created
at a lower altitude and propagated at a faster
speed of 211±8 km s−1. The lifetime of blob2 is
close to 2 minutes in EUV wavelengths. In pan-

els (c) and (e), we superpose the intensity con-
tours of the 1330 ˚A images at 05:02:39 UT and
05:02:57 UT with white lines. It is found that
blob2 observed in 1330 ˚A and 171 ˚A are cospa-
tial. In other words, blob2 observed in 1330 ˚A
had its counterpart in 171 ˚A. Blob3 was cre-
ated around 05:02:47 UT at an altitude slightly
higher than blob2 and propagated upward at
a speed of 113±12 km s−1. The intensity of
blob3 decreased too quickly to be recognized af-
ter 05:03:23 UT. Blob4 was formed at the lowest
altitude. The velocity decreased from ∼127 km
s−1 before 05:02:35 UT to ∼42 km s−1 after-
wards. In panel (e), like blob2, blob3 and blob4
observed in 1330 ˚A had their counterparts in
171 ˚A. Combing with Figure 5, we can conclude
that the velocities of the blobs observed in UV
and EUV wavelengths are almost identical. The
coincident presence of blobs in UV and EUV
wavelengths indicate that the blobs are multi-
thermal, with their temperatures ranging from
0.025 MK to several MK. We have checked the
movie of jets in 94 ˚A and failed to ﬁnd clear
signature of blobs, which means that the tem-
perature of the blobs are lower than the peak
temperature (∼6.3 MK) of 94 ˚A.

The sizes of the blobs are deﬁned as the full
widths at half-maximum (FWHM) of the inten-
sity variation curve along the cuts across the
blobs. We measured the widths of all blobs in
jet2 observed by IRIS manually and draw a his-
togram of the widths in Figure 8. The widths
range from 0.′′45 to 1.′′35, with a mean value
of 0.′′78 and standard deviation of 0.′′19.
It is
clear that most of the blobs (∼84%) in jet2 are
subarcsecond (<1′′) and only 16% have widths
greater than 1′′. The sizes of blobs observed
by IRIS are signiﬁcantly smaller than those ob-
served by SDO (Zhang & Ji 2014b; Zhang et al.
2016a; Shen et al. 2017).

3.3. Blob in jet1

Considering the plentiful blobs in jet2, one
may also expect a large number of blobs in jet1.

peared at ∼05:03:35 UT and propagated up-
ward at a speed of 39±12 km s−1 before dis-
appearing at ∼05:04:47 UT. Figure 9 shows the
EUV images observed by AIA around 05:04:09
UT, where blob* in jet1 is pointed by the white
arrows. The big diﬀerence between the veloci-
ties of blob* and the blobs in jet2 is probably
due to the diﬀerent environments and velocities
of reconnection outﬂow of the jets. In Table 2,
we list the widths and velocities of the blobs
observed in 1330 ˚A and 171 ˚A.

4. DISCUSSION

In the 2D standard ﬂare model, when a ﬁla-
ment or ﬂux rope losses equilibrium and erupts
into the interplanetary space, a thin current
sheet forms between the cusp-shaped PFLs
and CME (Lin et al. 2004).
The hot and
bright current sheet has been frequently ob-
served and substantially investigated in EUV
and white light wavelengths (e.g., Lin et al.
Observations of
2005; Seaton et al. 2017).

blob2 (green), blob3 (cyan), and blob4 (magenta)

velocity of blob4 is plotted with a red line.

We checked carefully the UV and EUV images
of the jets, only to ﬁnd one blob observed by
IRIS and AIA. In Figure 4(d)-(g), the orange
arrows point to the blob in jet1, which is la-
beled with blob*. The width and velocity of
the blob are 1′′±0.′′2 and 41±11 km s−1.

An open question about the blobs in var-
ious scales
is that how are they created.
It has been predicted that a current sheet
may experience TMI when it is thin enough
(Furth et al. 1963). Most of the authors at-
tribute the observations of blobs to TMI in a
current sheet (e.g., Ohyama & Shibata 1998;
Kliem et al. 2000; Asai et al. 2004; Karlick´y
2004; Kumar & Cho 2013). The creation, frag-
mentation, and coalescence of plasmoids in a
current sheet have been well reproduced in mul-
tidimensional numerical simulations (Ni et al.
2012a,b; Nishizuka & Shibata 2013; Yang et al.
2013; Ni et al. 2015; Wyper et al. 2016). Based
on the numerical simulations of the jet forma-
tion due to the magnetic reconnection between
the newly emerging ﬂux and the previous coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld, Ni et al. (2017) proposed
that there are two possible mechanisms of the
blobs. One is TMI and the other is KHI. In
this paper, we prefer that the tiny blobs are
created by TMI for two reasons. On the one
hand, there is no obvious swirling or vortex mo-
tion of the blobs as a result of velocity shear
in jet2. On the other hand, the lower part of
jet2 is very close to the CRF (see Figure 3).
A magnetic null point may exist where electric
current can accumulate (Thurgood et al. 2017).
In Figure 10, six snapshots of jet2 observed by
AIA and SJI during 05:00−05:02 UT are dis-
played. At the very beginning of jet2, a “huge”
plasmoid is ejected upward at a speed of ∼150
km s−1, which is followed by the formation and
ejection of multiple blobs as described above.
This is a miniature version of plasmoid erup-
tion and the underlying current sheet in the
standard ﬂare model (e.g., Shibata et al. 1995;
Lin et al. 2004; Nishizuka & Shibata 2013).

Some blobs (e.g., blob1) are ﬁrstly seen at
locations far away from the ﬂaring site or cusp
of the jets. These remote blobs could be as-
sociated with the shocks as interpreted by
In the numerical sim-
Huang et al. (2018b).

are found in the current sheet with tem-
perature of 2.5 MK and electron density of

ulations of Ni et al. (2017), the bright point
pointed by the white arrows are caused by
the fast reconnection outﬂows associated with
shocks (see their Fig. 4(a)). It is also pointed
out that the cusp region at the base of a jet
is not the unique region where magnetic recon-
nections take place. Magnetic reconnection and
plasmoid instability also take place inside the
jet above the cusp region. Hence, the blobs
which are ﬁrstly seen at locations far away from
the ﬂaring site or cusp region are possibly cre-
ated by the plasmoid instability inside the frag-
mented current sheets along the jet.

In Figure 8, the sizes of the blobs in jet2 ob-
served by IRIS /SJI are 0.′′45−1.′′35, with a mean
value of 0.′′78 and a standard deviation of 0.′′19.
For the three blobs (blob2, blob3, and blob4)
that are visible in both UV and EUV wave-
lengths, the sizes in 1330 ˚A are signiﬁcantly
smaller than those in 171 ˚A (see Table 2). The
diﬀerence is not caused by the resolution of the
instruments since it is beyond the uncertainty
brought in by the resolutions. One possible rea-
son of the diﬀerence is that diﬀerent compo-
nents of the same blob are separately observed
by SJI in 1330 ˚A and by AIA in 171 ˚A. Since
the formation temperature of 1330 ˚A is ∼0.025
MK, the blobs observed in 1330 ˚A represent the
cool component of plasmoids. The blobs ob-
served in EUV wavelengths represent the hot
component. This is in agreement with the pre-
vious numerical simulations of TMI in a current
sheet (Ni et al. 2016). The simulations indicate
that the plasmas inside the plasmoids can be
heated from 4200 K to >105 K during the mag-
netic reconnection near the temperature mini-
mum region, and the plasmoids are composed
of multithermal plasmas. In our study, we pro-
pose that the blobs in jet1 and jet2 are plas-
moids ejected upward along the jets and some
of them are heated to 105−106 K so that they
can be detected in EUV wavelengths. Ni et al.
(2017) found that the blobs both inside the cur-

rent sheet and along the jet are multithermal
and have diﬀerent sizes in diﬀerent wavelengths.
Figures 6 and 7 reveal that only a few of the
blobs created at the base of jet2 can been ob-
served in EUV wavelengths. The EUV ﬂux Fi
at a certain passband (e.g., 171 ˚A) can be ex-
pressed as

Fi =

Z

Ri(T ) × DEM(T )dT ≈ Ri(Tmax)n2

eH,

(1)
where Ri(T ) is the temperature response func-
tion of passband i, DEM(T ) stands for the dif-
ferential emission measure, Tmax is the elec-
tron temperature where the response reaches
the maximum, ne is the electron number den-
sity, and H is the integral line-of-sight depth
(Cheng et al. 2012). Therefore, the intensities
of blobs depend on both density and tempera-
ture of plasmas. The EUV intensities of blobs
should be high enough to be detected.
If the
blobs have very low density or temperature as
a result of insuﬃcient Joule heating, the inten-
sities will be too weak to be detected.

The kinematics of blob4 is interesting. As
is shown in Figure 5, blob4 decelerated from
∼130 km s−1 at 05:02:20 UT to ∼20 km s−1
at 05:03:20 UT. The deceleration is estimated
to be ∼1.8 km s−2, which is much larger than
the gravitational acceleration on the solar sur-
face. There are two possible reasons. The ﬁrst
explanation is that the ﬂux tubes holding the
blobs might be braiding, so that the curvature
decelerates the plasma blobs on the plane of sky.
The original idea of braiding ﬂux tubes where
electric current accumulates in the corona was
proposed by Parker (1983) and investigated in
numerical simulations by Pontin et al. (2017).
Owing to the extraordinarily high resolutions of
spacecrafts, direct observations of braiding ﬁne
structures are reported by Cirtain et al. (2013)
and Huang et al. (2018a). The second explana-
tion is that the plasmoids in the current sheet
might collide and coalesce. As is revealed in the

12

Zhang & Ni

previous numerical simulations (e.g., Ni et al.
2015, 2016, 2017), TMI in the current sheets
always result in many reconnection X-points,
bidirectional ﬂows, and plasmoids with diﬀer-
ent sizes and velocities adjacent to the X-points.
The collision and coalescence between these
blobs may result in rapid deceleration of the ris-
ing blobs.

5. SUMMARY

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength
observations of subarcsecond blobs on 2014 Au-
gust 24. The main results are summarized as
follows:

1. In AR 12149, a C5.5 CRF occurred at
∼04:55 UT, which consisted of a discrete
circular ribbon with a diameter of ∼1′ and
a short inner ribbon inside. Two jets (jet1
and jet2) were related to the ﬂare. Jet1
appeared ﬁrst and underwent untwisting
motion during its early propagation along
a large-scale, closed coronal loop. Jet2
appeared 6 minutes later and propagated
upward along another closed loop. Dur-
ing its initial phase (05:00−05:02 UT), a
big plasmoid was ejected out of jet2 at a
speed of ∼150 km s−1.

2. After the ﬂare peak time (05:02 UT), mul-
tiple bright and compact blobs appeared
in the lower part of jet2, which were ob-
served by IRIS /SJI in 1330 ˚A. The sizes
of the blobs are 0.′′45−1.′′35, with a mean
value of 0.′′78 and a standard deviation of
0.′′19. Nearly 84% of the blobs are subarc-
second, and only 16% are larger than 1′′.
The velocities of the blobs range from ten
to more than 220 km s−1, some of which
decelerate and disappear during the up-
ward propagation. The formation of blobs
ended around 05:08 UT.

3. Three of the blobs (blob2, blob3, and
blob4) in jet2 had their counterparts in

EUV wavelengths observed by AIA, and
the velocities are almost equal in UV and
EUV wavelengths. We suppose that the
blobs observed in 1330 ˚A are the cool com-
ponent (∼0.025 MK), while the blobs ob-
served in EUV are the hot component of
several MK. In jet1, only one blob was
clearly observed, with a size of 1′′±0.′′2 and
a velocity of ∼40 km s−1.

4. We conclude that the blobs are created by
TMI of the current sheet at the base or in-
side the coronal jets. Beneﬁting from the
unprecedented spatial resolution of IRIS,
our results are important to uncover the
ﬁne structures of coronal jets and address
the relationship between the jets observed
in UV and EUV wavelengths. They will
not only impose constraint on the theo-
retical models of coronal jets, but have
implication for magnetic reconnection as
well. Additional case studies and numeri-
cal simulations are fairly in demand to ﬁg-
ure out the cause and properties of blobs.
