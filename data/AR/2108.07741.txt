ABSTRACT
Magnetic helicity (MH) is a measure of twist and shear of magnetic ﬁeld. MH is
injected in the active region (AR) corona through photospheric footpoint motions
causing twisted and sheared magnetic ﬁelds. From the conservation property of the
helicity, it was conjectured that an already twisted ﬂux rope (FR) with continuous
injection of MH inevitably erupts to remove the excess accumulated coronal helic-
ity. Therefore, understanding the nature and evolution of the photospheric helicity
ﬂux transfer is crucial to reveal the intensity of the ﬂare/CME activity. Using the
time-sequence vector-magnetograms of Helioseismic Magnetic Imager, we study the
evolution of MH injection in emerging AR 12257. The photospheric ﬂux motions in
this AR inject positive helicity in the ﬁrst 2.5 days followed by negative helicity later.
This successive injection of opposite helicity is consistent with the sign of mean force-
free twist parameter (αav), orientation of magnetic-tongues. Also, the extrapolated
AR magnetic structure exhibits transformation of global-shear without a twisted FR
in the core of the AR. No CMEs are launched from this AR but C-class ﬂaring activity
is observed predominantly in the second half of the evolution period. The ARs with
sign reversal of the MH injection are not favorable to twisted FR formation with ex-
cess coronal helicity and therefore are important to identify CME-less ARs readily. A
possible scenario in these ARs is that when one sign of helicity ﬂux is replaced by op-
posite sign, the magnetic ﬁeld of diﬀerent connectivity with opposite shear undergoes
reconnection at diﬀerent scales giving rise to both intermittent ﬂares and enhanced
coronal heating.

INTRODUCTION

The large-scale activity of the sun, i.e. ﬂares and coronal
mass ejections (CMEs), is believed to occur by release of the
magnetic energy which was pre-stored in the slowly evolving
magnetic ﬁeld of the active regions (ARs). The evolution of
the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld is driven by the slow motions
of the footpoints. These motions are dominated by vertical
plasma motions in the early phase of the AR emergence and
later on dominated by horizontal motions. These motions
include in various ways shear, twist, converging, and diver-
gent motions. They induce the foot point motions of coronal
ﬂux tubes, which imply a transfer of magnetic energy, shear
and twist in the coronal magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Kusano et al.
2002; Priest & Forbes 2002; Tian et al. 2008).

The amount of twist and shear of the magnetic ﬁeld
is quantiﬁed by a physical parameter called magnetic he-

licity (Moﬀatt 1978). The magnetic helicity is conserved in
an ideal MHD process and changes very slowly in a resis-
tive process (Taylor 1974; Berger 1984; Pariat et al. 2015).
Using this conservation property, the photospheric ﬂux of
relative magnetic helicity was employed to estimate the ac-
cumulation of the coronal helicity budget by photospheric
foot point motions (Chae 2001; D´emoulin et al. 2002b; Pariat
et al. 2005; Tian & Alexander 2008; Liu & Schuck 2012; Ve-
mareddy 2015). Early studies focused on the long term injec-
tion by diﬀerential rotation (DeVore 2000; D´emoulin et al.
2002a) as well as on the impulsive large variations of the
helicity injection during M and X-class ﬂares (Moon et al.
2002). A statistical study was also carried out to relate the
variation of the helicity injection rate and its accumulation
with the ﬂare productivity (LaBonte et al. 2007; Park et al.
2010).

Present understanding of eruptive activity links the ori-
gin and existence of the twisted ﬂux rope without which
large scale CME eruption beyond 10 R(cid:12) is not possible

(Vourlidas et al. 2013). Recent observations of the ARs re-
veal ﬂaring activity without the associated CMEs, which
require a diﬀerent physical mechanism than CME produc-
ing ARs. From this perspective, the connection of the helic-
ity ﬂux evolution with a distinct activity had advanced our
understanding recently. Using time-sequence high-resolution
vector magnetic ﬁeld observations of the ARs, (Vemareddy
2015) ﬁrst discussed the global time-proﬁle of the helicity
ﬂux injection and its relevance to CMEs. In this report, he
presented three kinds of emerging ARs with helicity ﬂux in-
jection positive/negative and a changing sign over the time-
evolution. The ARs with positive/negative helicity ﬂux in-
jection were found to launch CMEs at some point in time,
whereas the AR with sign-changing helicity ﬂux injection
launched no-CMEs except C-class ﬂares. Further such stud-
ies reported that the ARs with a predominant sign of he-
licity injection are the source regions of the CMEs (e.g.,
Vemareddy 2017, 2019b; Dhakal et al. 2020). These studies
inferred that the magnetic ﬂux rope is built up by the line-
tied photospheric motions which inject the magnetic helicity
continuously.

From the basic conservation property of the helicity,
Zhang & Low (2005) proposed that an already formed
twisted ﬂux rope (twisted ﬂux) with continuous injection
of magnetic helicity inevitably erupts in order to remove the
excess accumulated helicity. Given this idea implies to the
existence of helicity upper bound in the AR which is still at
a conjecture level. Further this Low’s proposal of helicity up-
per bound was investigated in a theoretical study by Zhang
& Flyer (2008) which suggested that a coronal magnetic ﬁeld
may erupt into a CME when the applicable helicity bound
falls below the already accumulated helicity as the result of a
slowly changing boundary condition. Their calculations also
showed that a monotonic accumulation of magnetic helicity
can lead to the formation of a magnetic ﬂux rope applicable
to kink instability.

Towards the above Low’s conjecture of helicity upper
bound, numerical simulations have also been performed.
Zuccarello et al. (2018) used MHD simulations to evaluate
the accumulation of relative magnetic helicity under the dif-
ferent boundary ﬂows. Their study suggested the existence
of a threshold in a quantity deﬁned by the ratio between
the non-potential magnetic helicity and the total relative
magnetic helicity, which remained same at the onset of the
eruptions in all simulation runs. This ratio was also indica-
tive to be eruptive potential in the AR magnetic ﬁeld con-
structed from non-linear force-free ﬁeld model based on ob-
served photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld (Moraitis et al.
2019; Thalmann et al. 2019).

In the above context, therefore, the nature of the helic-
ity injection with a predominant sign is the key to reach the
state of the excess coronal helicity accumulation and then
the CME eruption from the AR. On the other hand, very
few ARs are seen with helicity injection whose dominant sign
is changing in time (Yamamoto & Sakurai 2009; Liu et al.
2014; Vemareddy 2015). In that case, the helicity accumu-
lation in the ﬁrst part of evolution is possibly canceled by
the later part. In an emerging AR 11928, the helicity ﬂux
was found to change sign from positive to negative over its
evolution (Vemareddy 2015; Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017).
CMEs were not launched from this AR except the C-class
ﬂaring activity. To the best of our knowledge, this was the

ﬁrst study citing a counter example to the eruptive ARs with
predominant sign helicity injection. Such reports provide ob-
servational proof of conservation property of the helicity and
will shed more light on the threshold levels of helicity bud-
get in the ARs. In this letter, we report another AR case of
changing sign of helicity injection over time and the scenario
of coronal magnetic ﬁeld evolution. Observational data used
are brieﬂy described in Section 2, results are presented in
Section 3 and a summarized discussion is given in Section 4.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

The AR 12257 appeared on January 6, 2015 near the solar
disk center of E16oN 7o inside an old decaying AR. Its mag-
netic ﬁeld emerged continuously at least until January 10,
while later on it was too close to the solar limb to moni-
tor the ﬁeld evolution (it reached the limb on January 14).
It had a leading negative polarity as the majority of the
ARs located in the northern hemisphere in solar cycle 24.
The full evolution of the AR was captured by space-borne
Solar Dynamics Observatory as it gives uninterrupted high-
cadence full-disk observations of EUV as well as magnetic

ﬁeld. We used the vector magnetic ﬁeld (B) observations
of the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al.
2012) at a cadence of 12-minute for ﬁve days since the AR
emergence. Details of deriving vector magnetic ﬁelds from
the full-disk ﬁltergrams can be referred to in Bobra et al.
(2014), Hoeksema et al. (2014). Figure 1 displays represen-
tative vector magnetograms of the AR during the emerging
phase, which delineates opposite magnetic patches growing
both in size and distance. To note, the AR does not have a
closed compact polarity inversion line (PIL) as the opposite
polarities separate with their emergence. This contrasts with
eruptive ARs, e.g., 11158, 11429, 12673 which have intense
ﬂares/CMEs (Vemareddy et al. 2012b; Vemareddy 2019a).
The evolution of the vertical component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld, Bz, is characterized by a continuous emergence
of bipolar ﬁeld (Figure 1 and associated movie). This emer-
gence started on January 6, 2015 and continues until the
AR was too close to the western limb to identify the evo-
lution. The distribution of Bz in both magnetic polarities
has extensions so that the magnetogram resembles the yin-
yang pattern. These extensions are called magnetic tongues
(L´opez Fuentes et al. 2000; Luoni et al. 2011) which present
typically in emerging bipolar ARs. They can be understood
as the signature of the azimuthal (poloidal) ﬁeld component
of an emerging ﬂux rope. The orientation of the tongues
(which is same as the orientation of the PIL) with respect
to the line joining the center of the two polarities (dashed
line in Figure 1) indicates the sign of magnetic helicity in
the emerging ﬂux rope (Poisson et al. 2016). The evolution
of the magnetic tongue pattern in this AR indicates that the
emerging ﬁeld has positive, then negative magnetic helicity
(Figure 1).

tem. This is related to the change in the magnetic tongue
pattern described in the previous section. More quantita-
tively, the ﬂux of helicity in Equation (1) can be rewritten
with the horizontal (tangential) photospheric velocity u of
the elementary magnetic ﬂux tube deﬁned as (D´emoulin &
Berger 2003)

Then Equation (1) is simpliﬁed by replacing Vt by u
and with vn = 0. This formulation shows that the evo-
lution of the Bn magnetogram allows to derive the helic-
ity ﬂux from the magnetic polarity motion (u). This links
the evolution of the magnetic tongues to the magnetic he-
licity injection. Next, since there is more negative helicity
injected later on, the accumulated helicity in the corona (
H(t) = (cid:82) t
dt dt(cid:48) ) also turns sign from positive to nega-
tive by the end of January 9.

t(cid:48)=0

dH

In contrast, the energy ﬂux dE/dt (Figure 2c), is always
positive (except marginally at the beginning). It ﬁrst grows
before declining after 2 days of emergence. dE/dt is of the
order of 1027 erg/s. This implies that the coronal magnetic
energy content becomes 1032 erg by January 8. Only a frac-
tion of this energy, the one in excess of the potential ﬁeld
energy computed from the same Bn magnetogram, is avail-
able to power the activity. From the GOES and EUV data
analysis, the AR produced only C-class ﬂares (Figure 3c).

In Figure 3a, we plot the helicity ﬂux normalized by
the mean magnetic ﬂux of the magnetic polarities (Φ =
dt /Φ2(t), mea-
(Φ+ + |Φ−|)/2). This normalized quantity, dH
sures the helicity ﬂux per unit ﬂux. This allows to compare
the helicity ﬂux among ARs having diﬀerent Φ magnitude.
dt /Φ2| stays below 0.8 × 10−6 s−1 which is modest for
| dH
an AR. We also normalize the accumulated helicity by Φ2
value. H(t)/Φ2(t) reaches 0.03 turn and then changes sign
to -0.02 turn. This is a modest input by a comparison with
AR 12371, which produces 4 eruptions, since this value was
found to be 0.15 turn (Vemareddy 2017).

We next compute the mean force-free twist parameter
αav = (cid:82) Jn sign(Bn) dS/ (cid:82) |Bn| dS. αav measures the non-
potentiality of the AR magnetic ﬁeld, with α being constant
along any ﬁeld line of a force-free ﬁeld. αav also evolves from
positive to negative values with a change of sign at the be-
ginning of January 8 (Figure 3b). This is another indication
that the coronal ﬁeld changed helicity sign, as the signs of
magnetic and current helicity, then of αav, are typically ex-
pected in coronal conﬁgurations (Russell et al. 2019).

Finally, we derived the light curves of the EUV emission
of the AR in AIA 94 and 171 ˚A. For this purpose, we use AIA
observations of the AR at 3 minute cadence. The EUV ﬂux
in ARs is typically proportional to the magnetic ﬂux (e.g.
D´emoulin 2004). Since the AR has a increasing magnetic
ﬂux, we normalized the light curves with the mean magnetic
ﬂux of the opposite polarities and plotted them in Figure 3c.
Two ﬂares are registered in AIA 94 on January 6 which are
not identiﬁed by the GOES X-ray ﬂux. Next, during the
period of dH/dt < 0, on January 9 and 10, ﬁve C-class
ﬂares occurred (the largest is a C9.6 on 09/08:04 UT). By
a careful inspection, we noted that none of these ﬂares are
associated with CMEs visible in LASCO C2 ﬁeld of view.

The change of sign of the photospheric magnetic helic-
ity ﬂux with time has implications on the global magnetic

conﬁguration of the AR. In order to realize the change in the
magnetic conﬁguration, we modelled the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld of the AR by non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) ex-
trapolation technique (Wheatland et al. 2000; Wiegelmann
2004; Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010). The photospheric vec-
tor magnetic observations B are employed as lower bound-
ary conditions and are embedded in an extended region by
padding with null array. The ﬁnal computations are carried
out in a Cartesian grid of 400 × 400 × 256 corresponding to
a physical volume of 292 × 292 × 187 Mm3.

In Figure 4, the rendered magnetic structure at diﬀer-
ent times is compared with the coronal plasma loops present
in the images of AIA 94 and 171 ˚A. Plasma emission in 94
˚A waveband captures compact loops of the AR, whereas
the 171 ˚A waveband shows higher lying loops together gives
a more global picture of the AR magnetic structure. The
modelled magnetic structure, to a great extent, resembles
the morphology of plasma loops in AIA passbands. On Jan-
uary 6-7, the core of the AR is formed by an arcade of coro-
nal loops with a positive magnetic shear (as deduced from
their crossing angle with the PIL). This is coherent with the

ﬁeld line orientations and with αav (Figure 3b). In between
the end of January 7 and the beginning of January 8, the
observed coronal loops have no marked shear, and the ex-
trapolated ﬁeld is nearly potential (second row of Figure 4),
in agreement with the low value of αav. By mid January
8, the coronal arcade in the core of the AR has a marked
negative shear, and this is observed later on. This is again
in agreement of the computed ﬁeld lines, dH/dt, and αav.

Having 3D magnetic ﬁeld of the AR corona, we can also
estimate the relative helicity with respect a reference ﬁeld
Bp which is having the same normal ﬁeld component as that
of the magnetic ﬁeld being evaluated (Berger & Field 1984)

where A and Ap are vector potentials of B and Bp respec-

(DeVore 2000; Valori et al. 2016). The HR is estimated to
be [0.40, 1.01, -2.43, -3.17]×1042 Mx2 respectively for the
observations on Jan 7, 8, 9 and 10. To some approximation,

the ﬁrst two values are consistent with the values derived
from time integration of dH/dt, but the third value is way
diﬀerent in sign itself. Two approaches diﬀer in the values
because the later lacks information on the coronal helicity
that was injected through the photospheric surface and par-
ticularly in this case the sign change in dH/dt adds to the
problem of estimating coronal helicity from time-integration
approach.

The above coronal evolution is also consistent with the
injection of magnetic helicity shown in Figure 2b as follows.
There is a clear decrease of the mean helicity ﬂux at the
beginning of January 8 which is due to the emergence of
some negative helicity, while the total ﬂux is still positive.
This is associated to the retraction of the tongues indicat-
ing positive helicity and the tongues increasingly become
reverse orientation. Since the magnetic ﬂux, which succeeds
to cross the photosphere, typically expands in the corona in
numerical simulations, in agreement with observations, the
corona has to respond to the changing boundary condition

MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2021)

under the scenario of quasi-static evolution (Vemareddy &
Wiegelmann 2014). As a result, the coronal magnetic struc-
ture at each time is close to an equilibrium corresponding to
the evolution of the observed boundary ﬁeld.

The above photospheric and coronal observations, in
agreement with the NLFFF extrapolation, provide a clear
description of this unusual AR evolution where opposite
magnetic helicities are successively injected by a continuous
emergence of a bipolar magnetic ﬁeld. Since the presence of
ﬁnite magnetic helicity limits the available free energy well
above the potential ﬁeld energy, the presence of opposite
magnetic helicities is a favorable condition for the coronal
ﬁeld to be able to release more magnetic energy, for a given
initial and potential energies. Indeed, a possible enhanced
ﬂaring activity was suggested to be a result of cancellation
of helicity of the oppositely sheared ﬁeld as shown by nu-
merical simulations of (Kusano et al. 2004).

Moreover, this AR also does not develop a sigmoidal

(Green & Kliem 2009; Green et al. 2011; Savcheva et al.

of a ﬂux rope, as found in MHD simulations (Amari et al.

2003; Aulanier et al. 2010), is not eﬃcient enough. Indeed,
the studied AR has intense magnetic ﬁeld of opposite mag-

continuous emergence, with separation of the polarities, pre-
vent ﬂux cancellation to occur at the PIL in this emerging

phase. In the context of previous observations and numerical
simulations, this observed evolution do not favor the forma-
tion of a coronal ﬂux rope which is indeed not found with
the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld.

4 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We studied an uncommon AR with photospheric motions
generating successive injection of opposite sign of magnetic
helicity within a continuous process of magnetic emergence.
The origins of this sign change lies in the sub-photospheric
formation of this coherent magnetic structure having oppo-
site magnetic helicities. These are challenging observations
for dynamo models. A proxy of the helicity injection is the
most easily seen in longitudinal magnetograms with a yin-
yang pattern of the bipolar ﬁeld, or polarity elongations
called magnetic tongues. While in most emerging bipolar
ARs, the magnetic tongues indicate injection of magnetic
helicity of a given sign, in the studied AR, the yin-yang pat-
tern reverse its orientation during the emergence, indicating
a change of helicity sign injection. This reversal is conﬁrmed
by the computation of the magnetic helicity ﬂux. This is also
coherent with the evolution of the mean force-free parame-
ter, α, and of the observed shear of coronal loops.

Earlier studies reported a tendency that mixed signs of
helicity ﬂux is found in ﬂare-producing ARs, whereas CME
producing regions have injection of a predominant sign (ei-
ther positive or negative) helicity ﬂux (Moon et al. 2002;
Romano et al. 2011; Vemareddy et al. 2012b,a). Based on
these kinds of observations, Kusano et al. (2003) suggested
that coexistence of positive and negative helicities are impor-
tant for the onset of ﬂares and further proposed a numerical
model to convert a sheared ﬁeld to shear-free by magnetic
reconnection of oppositely sheared magnetic ﬁelds. In the
studied AR, a similar evolution is present with dH/dt chang-
ing sign from positive to negative. The origins of this sign
change lies in the distribution of dH/dt. A dominant sign of
positive (negative) dH/dt is due to a large fraction of the
magnetogram injecting positive helicity ﬂux for a given foot
point motions. When the initial positive H-ﬂux is replaced
gradually by negative H-ﬂux in the later part of the evolu-
tion, the loop system in the AR also transforms shear from
positive to negative sign. In this process, current sheet forms
between opposite sheared ﬁeld. Then reconnection of those
ﬁeld lines gives rise to intermittent ﬂares of any magnitude
depending on the local shear distribution, as observed in
this AR. It is also very likely that the reconnection between
the opposite helicities occurs continuously in the interacting
magnetic ﬁelds with diﬀerent connectivities, then the slow
heating causes enhanced EUV emission. Therefore, the re-
connection between opposite sheared ﬁeld is intermittent to
a large scale and gradual to a small scale ﬁeld. Based on the
observations in AR 11928, Vemareddy & D´emoulin (2017)
suggested that the cancellation of the helicity during the evo-
lution leads to relaxation of the sheared ﬁeld by magnetic
reconnection causing small-scale ﬂares and coronal heating.
From the helicity accumulation scenario, ARs with
change of dH/dt sign may not favor the twisted ﬂux rope

Zhang & Flyer (2008) revealed that the magnitude of the
helicity upper bound of force-free ﬁelds is non-trivially de-
pendent on the boundary condition. Their study indicated
that the dipolar ﬁeld had a helicity (helicity value normal-
ized by the square of the respective surface poloidal ﬂux
equivalent to H(t)/Φ2(t)) upper bound of 0.35 which is com-
parable to the observational estimations of ? and the recent
emerging active regions with CME occurrences reported in
Vemareddy (2015). Importantly, for the multipolar bound-
ary condition Zhang & Flyer (2008) found a helicity upper
bound 10 times smaller than those with a dipolar bound-
ary condition. The present studied AR 12257 is having an
overall bipolar conﬁguration with H(t)/Φ2 well below 0.035
turns (See Figure 3a). Another such example AR 11928 of
opposite sign dH/dt also have this value 0.07 which is far
below the theoretical upper bound (Vemareddy & D´emoulin
2017). Therefore, the ARs with reversal of the helicity ﬂux
are arguably with coronal helicity below the upper bound
and are very important to identify CME-less (but conﬁned
ﬂare productive) ARs readily.

Further, we would point that the theoretical estima-
tions of helicity upper bound are still debated because sev-
eral eruptive ARs were not diﬀerentiable from their counter-
parts with that value (LaBonte et al. 2007; D´emoulin 2007;
D´emoulin & Pariat 2009). It remains to be explored further
for the precise value of the helicity upper bound, by assess-
ing the ARs of eruptive and non-eruptive behavior based on
the statistical value together with the twisted ﬂux in the
magnetic structure. In the case of not having an idea of this
limit, we can directly probe the twisted ﬂux, as the key in-
formation, in the AR magnetic structure.

Even continuous injection of dH/dt may not ensure oc-
currence of a CME. While accumulation of magnetic helicity
of a given sign leads to the helicity upper bound but it is not
a suﬃcient condition. Such ARs have also been observed re-
cently. The AR 12192 is one such example which is ﬂare pro-
ductive with large X-class ﬂares none of them are associated
with CMEs (Sun et al. 2015; Vemareddy 2017). The dH/dt
evolution in 12192 is a positive sign during its entire evolu-
tion. However, the extrapolated ﬁeld does not show the pres-
ence of a twisted ﬂux rope. So the eruptive nature of an AR
is decided by two factors, 1) continuous injection of a given
sign of helicity by the AR magnetic ﬁeld, 2) formation and
existence of twisted ﬂux rope. Vemareddy (2019b) showed
that dH/dt/Φ2 for CME-less AR has a smaller (factor ten)
helicity injection rate than the CME producing ARs, which
needs to be veriﬁed in larger sample of ARs. From the point
of space-weather, the characteristics of helicity ﬂux evolu-
tion in ARs is very much important to assess the problem of
coronal helicity threshold for the eruptivity of the magnetic
ﬁeld.
