ABSTRACT
We present a study of the BAL outﬂows seen in quasar SDSS J1042+1646 (z = 0.978) in the rest-frame
500 – 1050 ˚A (EUV500) region. The results are based on the analysis of recent Hubble Space Tele-
scope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations. Five outﬂow systems are identiﬁed, where in total
they include ∼70 outﬂow troughs from ionic transitions. These include the ﬁrst non-solar detections
from transitions of O v*, Ne v*, Ar vi, Ca vi, Ca vii, and Ca viii. The appearance of very high-
ionization species (e.g., Ne viii, Na ix, and Mg x) in all outﬂows necessitates at least two-ionization
phases for the observed outﬂows. We develop an interactive Synthetic Spectral Simulation method to
ﬁt the multitude of observed troughs. Detections of density sensitive troughs (e.g., S iv* λ657.32 ˚A
and the O v* multiplet) allow us to determine the distance of the outﬂows (R) as well as their ener-
getics. Two of the outﬂows are at R (cid:39) 800 pc and one is at R (cid:39) 15 pc. One of the outﬂows has the
highest kinetic luminosity on record ( ˙Ek = 5×1046 erg s−1), which is 20% of its Eddington luminosity.
Such a large ratio suggests that this outﬂow can provide the energy needed for active galactic nucleus
feedback mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION
Quasar absorption outﬂows are identiﬁed by blue-
shifted troughs that appear in quasar spectra (e.g., Hall
et al. 2002; Arav et al. 2013; Grier et al. 2015; Leighly
et al. 2018; Hamann et al. 2019). These outﬂows are
believed to play a major role in various active galactic
nucleus (AGN) feedback mechanisms (see elaboration in
section 1 of Arav et al. 2019, submitted to ApJS, here-
after Paper I). Observations and analyses show that these
outﬂows can have enough kinetic energy to be major con-
tributors to AGN feedback (e.g., Moe, et al. 2009; Dunn
et al. 2010; Borguet et al. 2013; Arav et al. 2013; Cham-
berlain & Arav 2015; Xu et al. 2019a). To assess how
eﬀective outﬂows are at contributing to AGN feedback,
theoretical models compare the kinetic luminosity of the
outﬂow ( ˙Ek) to the Eddington luminosity of the central
black hole (LEdd). These models predict that an Ed-
dington ratio, i.e., ΓEdd ≡ ˙Ek/LEdd, of at least 0.5 – 5%
is required for strong AGN feedback eﬀects (Hopkins &
Elvis 2010; Scannapieco & Oh 2004, respectively).

Broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) are ob-
served in (cid:39) 20% of the optically selected quasar pop-
ulation (e.g., Hall et al. 2002; Tolea et al. 2002; Hewett
& Foltz 2003; Reichard et al. 2003; Trump et al. 2006;
Ganguly & Brotherton 2008; Gibson et al. 2009, and
references therein). The majority of observed BALQ-
SOs only show absorption troughs from high-ionization
species, e.g., C iv, N v, Si iv (and H i), and are designated
as HiBALs. There are more than 10,000 ground-based
spectra of such outﬂows. However, almost all of these
cover rest-frame wavelengths longer than 1050 ˚A (Arav
et al. 2013). For these wavelengths, it is very rare to ﬁnd

diagnostic troughs that allow distance measurements of
the outﬂow from the central source (R) (e.g., Hamann
1998; Borguet et al. 2012b, 2013; Capellupo et al. 2014,
2017; Arav et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019a). Furthermore,
the λrest > 1050 ˚A cannot probe the very-high ioniza-
tion phase (VHP, probed by troughs from Ne viii, Mg x,
Si xii, and higher-ionization species). The VHP has been
shown to carry more than 90% of the outﬂow’s total hy-
drogen column density (NH) both in X-ray spectra of
Seyfert outﬂows (e.g., Behar et al. 2017) as well as in
quasar outﬂows where troughs from the above species
were covered (Arav et al. 2013; Finn et al. 2014). These
two parameters (R and NH) are the key to determining
˙Ek (see equation (5)) and, therefore, the possible contri-
bution of the outﬂow to AGN feedback.

The 500 –1050 ˚A rest-frame region (hereafter EUV500)
contains 10 times more measurable absorption features
in a quasar outﬂow (Arav et al. 2013). Some of these
have been observed and reported, including transitions
from N iv, O iv, O iv*, O v, O vi, Ne iv, Ne v, Ne vi,
Ne viii, Na ix, Mg x, Al xi, Si xii, S v, Ar vii, and Ar viii
(see table 3 for details of the speciﬁc transitions; Korista
et al. 1992; Telfer et al. 1998, 2002; Arav et al. 2001;
Muzahid et al. 2013; Finn et al. 2014). These include
troughs from the very-high ionization phase, which can
be used to determine NH (Arav et al. 2013), and troughs
from more than 10 excited state transitions, which can
be used to determine the electron number density (ne)
of an outﬂow and therefore R (e.g., Hamann et al. 2001;
Borguet et al. 2012a; Xu et al. 2018, 2019a). Here we
report the ﬁrst non-solar detection of troughs from O v*,
Ne v*, Ar vi, Ca vi, Ca vii, and Ca viii (see table 3 for
details).

We carried out a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)

program GO 14777 (PI: Arav), which targeted a sample
of 10 quasars (see selection criteria in Arav et al. 2019,
submitted) and observed the EUV500 with the Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph (COS). Using HST is necessary
since observing the EUV500 with ground-based tele-
scopes requires objects with redshift, z (cid:38) 3. At these
redshifts, the contamination from the Lyα forest is
severe, which does not allow for adequate measurements
of EUV500 troughs and, in most cases, not even their
detections. Therefore, the EUV500 is only practicably
accessible with the HST by observing bright quasars at
0.5 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 2 (Korista et al. 1992; Arav et al. 1999; Telfer
et al. 2002; Arav et al. 2001, 2013; Finn et al. 2014).

This paper is part of a series of publications describing
the results of HST program GO-14777, which observed
quasar outﬂows in the EUV500 using the COS.
Paper I (Arav et al. 2020) summarizes the results for
the individual objects and discusses their importance to
various aspects of quasar outﬂow research.
Paper II is this work.
Paper III (Miller et al. 2020a) analyzes 4 outﬂows
detected in 2MASS J1051+1247, which show remarkable
similarities, are situated at R ∼ 200 pc and have a
combined ˙Ek = 1046 erg s−1.
Paper IV (Xu et al. 2020b) presents the largest velocity
shift and acceleration measured to date in a BAL
outﬂow.
Paper V (Miller et al. 2020b) analyzes 2 outﬂows
detected in PKS 0352-0711, one outﬂow at R = 500 pc
and a second outﬂow at R = 10 pc that shows an
ionization potential-dependent velocity shift for troughs
from diﬀerent ions.
Paper VI (Xu et al. 2020c) analyzes 2 outﬂows detected
in SDSS 0755+2306, including one at R = 1600 pc with
˙Ek = 1046 – 1047 erg s−1.
Paper VII (Miller et al. 2020c) discusses the other
objects observed by program GO-14777, whose outﬂow
characteristics make the analysis more challenging.

In this paper, we describe the analysis of outﬂows seen
in quasar SDSS J1042+1646. The structure of the pa-
per is as follows. In section 2, we discuss the details of
the observations and data reductions. In section 3, we
introduce our spectral analysis method. We present the
analysis of each outﬂow system in section 4, where the
photoionization solutions and ne are determined. In sec-
tion 5, we determine the distances and energetics for the
outﬂows, and discuss these results in section 6. We sum-
marize the paper in section 7. We adopt a cosmology
with H0 = 69.6 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.286, and ΩΛ
= 0.714, and we use Ned Wright’s Javascript Cosmology
Calculator website (Wright 2006).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
SDSS J1042+1646 (J2000: R.A. = 10:42:44.24, decl. =
+16:46:56.14, z = 0.978 ) was observed with HST/COS
(Green et al. 2012) in November 2017 as part of our
HST/COS program GO 14777 (PI: Arav). We used
the G130M and G160M gratings, which have a resolving
power of λ/δλ (cid:39) 12,000 – 17,000 and 14,000 – 19,000,
respectively (Fox, et al. 2018). Our G130M observa-
tions cover the wavelength range of 1132 – 1472 ˚A and

the G160M ones cover 1383 – 1801 ˚A in the observed-
frame. This object was observed previously in June 2011
using HST/COS G140L in program GO 12289 (PI: J.
Howk). The COS G140L has a wider spectral coverage,
1100 – 2000 ˚A and lower resolving power ∼ 1500 – 4000.
There is a spectral gap in the G140L grating from around
1153 ˚A to 1185 ˚A. We show the details of both datasets
in table 1.

We reduced the SDSS J1042+1646 data and estimated
the errors following the same procedure described in
Miller et al. (2018). For the 2017 observations, we
combined the two observations for each grating. We
corrected for Galactic extinction with E(B-V) = 0.022
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). We show the full, dered-
dened spectrum in ﬁgure 1.

3. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
3.1. Unabsorbed Emission Model
We model the unabsorbed emission of the two diﬀerent
epochs separately following the approach of Chamberlain
& Arav (2015); Miller et al. (2018); Xu et al. (2018). The
models include two components: 1) a continuum which
is represented by a power law; 2) strong emission lines
such as O v and Ne viii, which are ﬁtted with one or
more Gaussian proﬁles. The adopted emission model for
the 2017 epoch is shown as the solid red line in ﬁgure 1.

3.2. Identifying Outﬂow Systems
The COS EUV500 spectrum of SDSS J1042+1646
shows a variety of absorption features due to the inter-
stellar medium (ISM) within our galaxy, intervening Lyα
forest systems, and quasar outﬂow absorption features
at diﬀerent velocities. We identify ﬁve kinematically dis-
tinct outﬂow systems (S1 – S4, where S1 has two compo-
nents: S1a and S1b, see table 2). The full, dereddened

The unabsorbed emission model and the ﬂux error are shown as the red and gray solid lines, respectively. We label the important ionic
absorption troughs in order of increasing velocity oﬀset for all 5 outﬂow systems (see section 4) with purple (S1a and S1b), orange (S2),
green (S3), and blue (S4) vertical dashed lines. Strong Galactic ISM lines (e.g., Si ii at 1260.42 ˚A) and geocoronal lines (e.g., H i at
1215.67 ˚A, O i at 1302.17 ˚A, and O i* at 1304.86 ˚A, 1306.03 ˚A) are marked with gray dotted lines under the spectrum.

Figure 1 (Continued). In the last panel, we show the 2011 data in the blue histogram, which covers an extra range from 1800 – 2000 ˚A.
In other regions, the 2011 data are consistent with the 2017 data except for the highest velocity outﬂow (S4, marked by blue dashed lines),
which we discuss elsewhere (Paper IV).

outﬂow systems with colored dashed lines (system 1a and
1b are merged for simplicity, see section 4.1).

3.3. Synthetic Spectral Simulation
The main method to analyze AGN outﬂows involves
the following steps: 1) identifying outﬂow systems at
distinct velocities; 2) measuring ionic column densities
(Nion) of their absorption troughs using three standard
methods, i.e., Apparent Optical Depth (AOD), Partial
Covering (PC), and Power Law (PL); and 3) compar-
ing these Nion with the predictions from photoionization
models to determine the physical properties for each out-
ﬂow (e.g., Hamann et al. 2001; Arav et al. 2001, 2012,
2018; Borguet et al. 2012a, 2013; Chamberlain & Arav

6

2015; Xu et al. 2019a). The AOD method assumes that
at every velocity the outﬂow completely and homoge-
neously covers the emission source (see, e.g., Savage &
Sembach 1991). The PC method assumes a constant
optical depth over a fraction of the emission source for
every velocity (see, e.g., Edmonds et al. 2011). The
PL method assumes the outﬂow at each velocity com-
pletely covers the emission source but has a varying op-
tical depth across the source in the form of a power law
(see, e.g., Arav et al. 2005).

For most of the previous works, the diagnostic absorp-
tion lines were within the λrest > 1050 ˚A. The above
method works well in this range since there is a rela-
tively small number of absorption troughs (mainly Lyα,
C iv, N v, Si iv, and in rare cases P v, and S iv). Blend-
ing of these absorption troughs between diﬀerent outﬂow
systems is minimal to moderate in most of the cases.

This analysis method is inadequate for the EUV500
band since the EUV500 band includes outﬂow troughs
from ∼ 70 individual transitions. The atomic properties
for these detected transitions are shown in table 3 and
the ionic transitions observed in SDSS J1042+1646 are
marked in red. With more troughs and multiple outﬂow
systems, trough blending is more severe than in the λrest
> 1050 ˚A range, especially when the absorption troughs
are wide [e.g., see the panel 2 in ﬁgure 1 (Continued)].
Therefore, it is diﬃcult to measure Nion directly for most
of the observed troughs in the EUV500. Similarly, it is
impractical to measure upper limits for all possible tran-
sitions (∼ 850 are within the wavelength range covered
in these data alone).

For these reasons, we developed a Synthetic Spectral
Simulation (SSS) method, which allows us to ﬁt the mul-
titude of troughs and determine the photoionization so-
lutions more eﬃciently and accurately. While SSS may
appear to be superﬁcially similar to the spectral synthesis
code SimBAL (Leighly et al. 2018), these two methods
are philosophically quite diﬀerent and to date have been
applied to diﬀerent rest-wavelength bands. The main
analyzing steps of SSS are:

(1) Instead of directly measuring Nion of each ab-
sorption trough, we only measure the uncontaminated
absorption troughs. For doublet transitions which are
not heavily saturated, we obtain Nion measurements
using the PC method as described in Arav et al. (2008).
For saturated transitions, we use the AOD Nion and
treat them as lower limits. For singlet transitions with a
maximum optical depth, τmax, greater than 0.5, we treat
the AOD Nion as lower limits. For absorption troughs
with τmax < 0.05, we determine the AOD Nion as upper
limits. For singlet transitions with 0.05 < τmax < 0.5
and where the outﬂow shows other absorption troughs
with τ > 2 from ionic transitions with similar ionization,
we treat the singlets’ AOD Nion as measurements since
they are minimally aﬀected by saturation eﬀects (<
10%).

(2) We then use these Nion as a basis to determine
a preliminary photoionization solution (PI1). Photoion-
ized plasma in an AGN outﬂow is characterized by the
total hydrogen column density, NH, and the ionization

parameter, UH, where

UH =

QH
4πR2nHc

(1)

QH is the source emission rate of hydrogen ionizing pho-
tons, R is the distance of the outﬂow from the central
source, nH is the hydrogen number density (for a highly
ionized plasma, nH (cid:39) 0.8 ne), and c is the speed of light.
We run the spectral synthesis code Cloudy [version
c17.00, Ferland et al. (2017)] to generate grids of pho-
toionization simulations. We assume a spectral energy
distribution (SED) and a metallicity (e.g., Arav et al.
2013, and see elaboration in section 4.1.2). We vary
log(UH) between -3.0 and 3.0, and log(NH) between 17.0
to 24.0 [hereafter, log(Nion) is in units of log(cm−2)] in
steps of 0.05 dex. At each grid point, Cloudy predicts
the Nion for all ions in its database.

For each unblended absorption trough from a given
ionic transition, we ﬁt their optical depth proﬁle in ve-
locity space by a Gaussian proﬁle as:

τ (v) =

A
√

2π

σ

× exp(

(v − vc)2

where τ (v) is the optical depth proﬁle of the absorption
trough, v is the velocity, A is the scaling factor, σ is
the velocity dispersion and vc is the velocity centroid of
the Gaussian proﬁle.
is the maximum τ of the
2π
trough from the model. For each outﬂow system, we
ﬁnd the best vc and σ by ﬁtting the detected unblended
absorption troughs.

A

For each ion, A in equation (2) is scaled according to
the predicted value of Nion based on PI1 (e.g., Savage &
Sembach 1991; Edmonds et al. 2011):

(3)

where N (v ) is the velocity distribution of Nion (cm−2
km−1 s), f is the oscillator strength of the correspond-
ing ionic transition, and λ is the rest wavelength of the
transition.

(3) We assume that all troughs in a given outﬂow sys-
tem can be modeled using a Gaussian τ (v) function (see
equation 2) with the same vc and σ determined from
the unblended absorption troughs of each outﬂow sys-
tem. We vary A to match the Nion predicted from PI1,
creating a full, AOD optical depth model for the entire
observed spectrum. This model is then used to produce
a synthetic spectrum which we overlay on top of the
data. Since PI1 has a minimal number of constraints
(no constraints from blended troughs and maybe a few
upper limits), there could be predicted troughs that con-
ﬂict with the data. Therefore, we ﬁrst look for predicted
troughs that violate the τmax upper limit threshold (dis-
cussed in step (1) above) within the continuum portion
of the data so that we can measure additional upper lim-
its. For example, PI1 for S1a did not include the up-
per limit from O iii. Inspection of the continuum region
around the O iii 833, O iii* 834, and O iii* 835 transi-

corresponding error for the 2017 epoch, respectively. We label the ﬁve outﬂow systems of the 2017 epoch and plot our models for them in
magenta (S1a), purple (S1b), blue (S2), green (S3), and orange (S4) dashed curves (see section 3.2 for details). The solid red lines are the
full SSS model by adding these ﬁve outﬂow systems. Strong Galactic ISM lines are shown in gray solid lines and marked with “ISM” at
the bottom of the plot. Similarly, we mark the known intervening systems by “Int.” and plot them as the gray dotted lines.

tions marked in Figure 1 showed predicted troughs from
PI1 that were not supported by the data (τmax exceeded
0.05 for the strongest transitions at those wavelengths).
Additional models are then created using UH and NH val-
ues that are on the boundary of the 1σ contour for PI1
and inspected to ensure that all upper limits are found.
(4) A new photoionization solution, PI2, is determined
for each outﬂow including any newly measured upper
limits, and another synthetic spectrum is created. As an
example, for S1a this resulted in a decrease in NH by 0.1
dex and an increase in UH by 0.03 dex for the high ioniza-
tion phase (compared to PI1) and no change in the very-
high ionization phase (see section 4.1.2). The blended
troughs are then inspected for regions where none of the
outﬂows have predicted troughs that can account for the
observed absorption (none were found in these data). For
such instances, the 1σ contour of PI2 is probed for all
outﬂows like what was done is step (3), and if only one
outﬂow trough is found that can match the absorption,
a new lower limit (or in rare cases involving doublets, a
measurement) can be made.

(5) A ﬁnal solution (PI) is then created from all mea-
surements and limits. As a ﬁnal check, the unblended
troughs yielding the measurements that produced PI1
are visually inspected to ensure that there are not any
contaminating troughs that would make the measure-
ments unreliable. As an example of the ﬁnal results, we
show the overall ﬁt to the data (see ﬁgure 2), where we
use the SSS solutions derived in section 4.1 – 4.3. The
colored dashed lines are for diﬀerent outﬂow systems,
while the solid red lines are the overall model achieved
by summing all outﬂow systems.

(6) To determine R, we use troughs from density sen-
sitive transitions to obtain ne (e.g., Hamann et al. 2001;
Korista et al. 2008; Borguet et al. 2012a; Arav et al. 2013;

Xu et al. 2019a). We vary the ne of the outﬂow systems
to ﬁt the troughs of transitions from excited states (see
section 4.2.3 as an example).

Overall, the SSS is a three-dimensional model
in
the parameter space of UH, NH, and ne. The detailed
analysis for each outﬂow system is shown step by step
in section 4, and we discuss the strengths and caveats of
this method in section 6.

4. ANALYSIS OF EACH OUTFLOW SYSTEM
In the ﬁve outﬂow systems, we observed strong ab-
sorption troughs from 1) high-ionization species, such as
N iv, O iii, O iv, O v, and Ca vi, which have compara-
ble ionization potential (IP) to the ionic transitions seen
in HiBALs, e.g., C iv, S iv and N v, from IP (cid:39) 45 –
100 eV. 2) very high-ionization species including Ar viii,
Ne viii, Na ix, and Mg x, with IP (cid:39) 100 – 500 eV. 3)
transitions from excited states, e.g., O iv*, O v*, and
S iv*, which are used to determine the ne of the outﬂows.
In our HST/COS spectra, we do not observe absorp-
tion troughs from any low-ionization species, which have
IP smaller than O iii (IP = 54.93 eV). Moreover, SDSS
J1042+1646 was observed in 2006 by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) in 1930 – 4600 ˚A rest-frame. We
found no absorption troughs from the low-ionization ion
transitions of Mg ii λλ2796.35, 2803.53 (IP = 15.03 eV).
Therefore, none of the outﬂows make SDSS J1042+1646
a low-ionization BALQSO (Voit et al. 1993).

The absorption troughs from outﬂow S1, S2, and S3 are
consistent with no trough variability between the 2011
and 2017 epochs. However, S4 shows a velocity shift of
–1550 km s−1 between the two epochs. The remarkable
behavior of S4 is described in Paper IV. In this paper, we
take into account the blending of troughs from S4, which
helps the analysis of the other three outﬂow systems.

Here, we report the detailed analyses of S1, S2, and S3.
The Nion for the 2017 epoch are presented in table 4. For
each system, the measured column densities (Nion,mea)
summed over all observed energy states are reported in
the third column. The ratios of measured to the mod-
eled column densities (i.e., Nion,mea/Nion,model) from the
SSS method are reported in the fourth column. When
we have Nion,mea as a lower limit, we expect Nion,model
> Nion,mea, therefore, Nion,mea/Nion,model < 1 and vice
versa.

nated/measurable rest wavelengths.

–7000 km s−1 to –4000 km s−1 show double-minima
features, which are most apparent in the Na ix-b, Ar vii
and Ar viii-b [hereafter, the “-b” or “-r” suﬃx stands
for the shorter (bluer) or longer (redder) wavelength
component of doublet transitions, respectively]. Since
these two features appear at the same velocity in several
troughs, we divide S1 into two components, 1a and 1b,
which are centered at -4950 km s−1 and -5750 km s−1,
respectively. For each individual
ion, we report the
measured Nion for the 2017 epoch in table 4.

The Nion measurements used for the initial UH and
NH solution are from the Na ix and Ar viii doublet
transitions, and they are determined in the following
ways: 1) For the Na ix doublets in component 1b, we
assume each trough is symmetric since the troughs are
well ﬁtted with Gaussian proﬁles (see ﬁgures 2 & 3)
and solve for Nion by using the PC equations on the
unblended high-velocity wing. We then double the
value to obtain the measurement. 2) Similarly, for the
Ar viii doublet in components 1a and 1b, the Ar viii-r
is contaminated by 2 intervening systems. Therefore,
the unblended half of the troughs are used to solve
the PC equations. Then, we double the values for the
Nion measurements. 3) The Na ix-r in component 1a
is blended with the Ar viii-b trough from S2.
If no
other information is available, we treat AOD Nion value
derived from the Na ix-b as a lower limit. However,
the Ar viii doublet of component 1a is not saturated
and is deeper than the Na ix-b absorption, while Ar viii
and Na ix have similar IPs. Therefore, we can safely
treat the AOD Nion value derived from the Na ix-b as a
measurement.

Given the signal-to-noise (S/N) of the data and diﬀer-

9

ionized species would be strong enough to be detected in
our spectrum. Indeed, the troughs from N iii are consis-
tent with no absorption.

The other ionic transitions are either saturated or un-
detected. Therefore, the AOD Nion for these two types
are treated as lower and upper limits, respectively.

Figure 3. Comparison between the data and SSS models for the
absorption troughs in components 1a and 1b of S1, where their
velocity centers are marked by the red and blue dashed lines at
-4950 km s−1 and -5750 km s−1, respectively. The normalized
spectrum is shown in green for the 2011 epoch and purple for the
2017 one. The best-ﬁtting SSS models for components 1a and 1b
are shown as red and blue dotted lines while the combined full
model for each region is shown as the black solid lines. We mark
the blue or red component of a doublet by adding a letter ”b” or
”r” after its ion label. In the Na ix-r panel, the absorption from
Ar viii-b of outﬂow S2 is shown as the orange solid line. Strong
intervening systems are modelled by narrow Gaussian proﬁles and
are added to the full model, i.e., at v ∼ -6600 km s−1 in the Na ix-
b and Na ix-r region; v ∼ -4950 and -5200 km s−1 in the Ar viii-r
region; v ∼ -4600, -6350, and -6600 km s−1 in the Ca vi region.

ent spectral resolution of the observations, the absorption
troughs are consistent with no variation between the two
epochs for most of the ions. An exception is the low-
velocity wing of the Ar viii-r absorption trough. How-
ever, the entire Ar viii-b troughs are consistent with no
variations between the 2011 and 2017 epochs. Therefore,
the deviation in Ar viii-r is not intrinsic to the outﬂow
system and may be due to calibration issues.

Ca vi has three transitions at 629.60 ˚A, 633.84 ˚A, and
641.90 ˚A, where their f ratios are almost 1:2:3, respec-
tively. Ca vi λ629.60 and λ633.84 are not measurable,
since the former coincides with the strong O v λ629.73
and the latter is blended with two intervening systems.
However, we observed shallow absorption troughs from
Ca vi λ641.90, i.e, τmax < 0.2. Therefore, the AOD Nion
derived will be close to the actual Nion value (see elabo-
rations in section 2.9 Leighly et al. (2011) and 5.4 of Arav
et al. (2013)). Thus, we treat the AOD Nion from the
absorption trough of Ca vi λ641.90 as a measurement.
Similarly, for S iv λ657.32, we are able to measure the
AOD Nion of it for both component 1a and 1b. We treat
them as Nion measurements since they have τmax < 0.3.
The strongest two observable transitions from O iii are
at 702.34 ˚A and 832.93 ˚A, and both are consistent with
no absorption. We get an upper limit on Nion for O iii
from the AOD measurement of the stronger f transition
at 702.34 ˚A. Since oxygen is the most abundant metal,
the non-detection of O iii hints that none of the doubly

4.1.2. SSS Models and Photoionization Solutions
After we determined Nion for unblended troughs, we
follow the SSS method in section 3.3 to get the best-
ﬁtting photoionization model for all observed troughs.
To account for systematics in the unabsorbed emission
model, the adopted Nion lower limits assume lower er-
rors of 20%, and Nion upper limits assume upper errors
of 20%. We assume solar metallicity (Grevesse et al.
2010) and the HE0238 SED (Arav et al. 2013). This
SED is based on observations of quasar HE0238–1904
in a similar rest-frame wavelength range to our object
(Arav et al. 2013). For the observed data (570–1000 ˚A
rest-frame), the ratio of the HE0238 SED with the SDSS
J1042+1646 continuum is constant to within ±10%. The

S v, and Ar v, and the lower limits from Ne viii, Mg x,
and Ca viii are consistent with this two phase solution
and omitted for clarity’s sake.

Similarly, component 1b (see the bottom panel of ﬁgure
−0.21 and log(UH) =

phase solutions to former studies in section 6.1.

−0.16, and a HP at log(NH) = 20.52+0.36

4.1.3. Determinations of ne From S iv and S iv*
The most robust way for determining the distance,
R, from the ionizing source of an absorption outﬂow is
to use the troughs from ionic excited states. The ratio
between the Nion from excited and ground states, e.g.,
N(S iv*)/N(S iv), yields ne for an outﬂow, and combined
with the value of UH, R can be determined (See equation
(1). e.g., Borguet et al. 2013; Chamberlain et al. 2015;
Arav et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018, 2019a).

For component 1a, we observed the absorption troughs
from the strongest S iv transition at 657.32 ˚A and the
corresponding excited state at 661.40 ˚A both with oscil-
lator strengths, f ∼ 1.18. For the 2017 data, we show
our best-ﬁtting SSS model for the S iv region in ﬁgure 5.
We clearly have a deeper feature in the S iv λ657.32 re-
gion than in the S iv* λ661.40 region for component 1a.
This yields log[N(S iv)] = 14.19+0.10
−0.13 and log[N(S iv*)]
= 13.35+0.11
−0.12. Following the same method described
in section 2 of Xu et al. (2019a), we derive log(ne) =
3.68+0.18
−0.25 for component 1a [hereafter, log(ne) is in units
of log(cm−3)].

Similarly, for component 1b, the absorption trough
from S iv λ657.32 shows a deeper feature than S iv*
λ661.40, while the latter cannot be much deeper than
the current modeling due to the ﬂux level on the two
shoulders (see ﬁgure 5). We get log[N(S iv)] = 13.93+0.14
−0.13
and log[N(S iv*)] = 13.21+0.10
−0.13. This leads to log(ne)
= 3.78+0.23
−0.26, which is consistent with the ne result for
component 1a within the errors. This strengthens the
possibility that both outﬂows originate from the same
absorber. After we determine ne for the outﬂows, R can
be derived (see section 5).

4.2. Outﬂow System 2 (v = –7500 km s−1)
S2 also shows absorption troughs from both high- and
very high-ionization species. Moreover, S2 has deep ab-
sorption troughs near its expected O v* multiplet region.
We begin by determining the Nion and constructing the
photoionization solutions. Following that, we model the
O v* regions and derive the constraints for ne and R.

4.2.1. Kinematics and Nion Determinations
We show the strong absorption troughs for S2 in ﬁgure
6, where the 2011 and 2017 epochs are shown in green
and purple colors, respectively. The data is consistent
with no variability between the 2011 and 2017 epochs.
We report the measured Nion in table 4 and discuss them
in detail here.

Similar to S1, we adopt the PC method and get Nion
measurements from the unblended and well-separated
Na ix and Ar viii doublets. The Ne viii and Mg x
doublet troughs are black at their deepest points, so

1a and 1b from S1. The purple and gray solid histograms are
the normalized ﬂux and errors for the 2017 epoch, respectively.
The red and blue lines are for component 1a and component 1b,
respectively. Based on our best-ﬁtting photoionization solution, we
show the predicted absorption troughs of S iv λ657.32 and S iv*
λ661.40 in red and blue dashed lines. The full absorption model
is shown as the solid black line, while strong intervening systems
are marked with black dashed lines. We increase and decrease
the optical depth such that the change in ﬂux at the centers of
the Gaussian proﬁles equal the noise level at that wavelength and
adopt them as the lower and upper bounds in ﬁtting the troughs,
respectively. These bounds are shown in green dashed lines.

best-ﬁtting model is shown as the black solid lines in ﬁg-
ure 3. Absorption troughs from components 1a and 1b
are plotted separately as blue and red dotted lines. The
ratios of measured Nion to the model predicted Nion are
presented in the 4th column in table 4.

Arav et al. (2013) demonstrated that detections of both
the very high-ionization troughs (e.g., Ne viii and Mg x)
and high-ionization troughs (e.g., O iv) in the same out-
ﬂow state two ionization phases for the absorber. We ﬁnd
the same situation in all of the outﬂow systems discussed
here. Figure 4 shows the models’ corresponding pho-
toionization solution. For component 1a (see top panel of
ﬁgure 4), the very high-ionization phase (VHP) is marked
as the red cross and is mainly constrained by the Nion
measurements of Na ix and Ar viii. However, this VHP
underestimates the observed N(S iv) by over a factor of
1000. Moreover, if we shift this VHP vertically up to
match the N(S iv) curve at log(NH) = 22.78, the solu-
tion will overpredict the N(Ar viii) by a factor of 13 and
N(Ca vi) by a factor of 22. Therefore, a pure VHP solu-
tion is unable to produce all of the observed Nion. The
high-ionization phase (HP) is marked by the blue cross
and produces the observed N(S iv) and is constrained
by the Nion upper limit of O iii. However, this HP pro-
duces negligible amounts of the observed N(Ar viii) and
N(Na ix). Therefore, we invoke a two-phase ionization
solution. The very high-ionization phase (VHP) has
log(NH) = 22.37+0.19
−0.09, and the
high-ionization phase (HP) has log(NH) = 20.39+0.40
−0.58 and
−0.30. The Nion upper limits from N iii,
log(UH) = –0.98+0.17

−0.12, and log(UH) = 0.42+0.16

their AOD Nion from the red component are taken
as lower limits. For the Ca vi triplet, the absorption
trough from Ca vi at 629.60 ˚A and 633.84 ˚A are blended
with the Galactic Lyα region, while the Ca vi λ641.90
shows similar but shallower trough features as the
Na ix doublet. After modeling out the contamination of
intervening systems (i.e., at v = –7050, –7320, –7720 km
s−1) by narrow Gaussian proﬁles, the AOD Nion value
from the Ca vi λ641.90 is treated as a measurement.
The absorption troughs from other ion transitions are
either lower or upper limits and are reported in table
4. The lack of detection from O iii and lower IP ions
demonstrates that this is not a low-ionization BALQSO.

4.2.2. SSS Models and Photoionization Solutions

We present the best-ﬁtting SSS model as the black solid
line in ﬁgure 6 for each trough and the corresponding
photoionization solution in ﬁgure 7. Similar to S1, all of
the observed troughs are well ﬁtted by a two-phase pho-
toionization solution. The VHP is constrained mainly
by the Nion measurements from Na ix and Ar viii, and is
supported by the Nion from Ca vi. This yields log(NH)
= 22.40+0.12
−0.06. The HP is con-
strained by the upper limit from S iv, measurement of
Ca vi, and the lower limits from O iv and N iv. This
yields log(NH) = 20.79+0.32
−0.34, and log(UH) = –0.60+0.17
−0.14.
Other ions from S2 that are not shown in ﬁgure 7 are
consistent with the solutions.

−0.10 and log(UH) = 0.4+0.12

4.2.3. Determination of ne From the O v* Multiplet
The O v* transitions near 760 ˚A are the isoelectronic
sequence of the C iii* transitions near 1175 ˚A, which are
sensitive to a wide range of ne (Gabel et al. 2005; Borguet
et al. 2012b; Arav, et al. 2015; Leighly et al. 2018). Our
HST program shows the ﬁrst clear detection of O v* ab-
sorption troughs in an AGN outﬂow,
in both quasar
SDSS J1042+1646 and PKS 0352-0711 (Paper V). For
the O v* multiplet, there are six (J – J
) components of
the 2s2p3PJ – 2p2 3PJ (cid:48) multiplet between 758.7 ˚A and
762.0 ˚A (Doyle et al. 1983; Keenan et al. 1994). However,
they are very rare to be observed in either emission or
absorption. Previously, the only extra-terrestrial detec-
tions of O v* were in solar spectra. The O v* multiplet
has been resolved as emission lines by the Harvard S-055
EUV spectrometer onboard Skylab (Doyle et al. 1983;
Keenan et al. 1994) and more recently by the Solar Ultra-
violet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on
board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
(O’Shea et al. 2000).

(cid:48)

In the upper panel of ﬁgure 8, the ratio of each J
level’s population to that of the ground state is plot-
ted as a function of ne. In the bottom panel, we show
the population ratios between diﬀerent J levels versus ne.
When log(ne) < 5, the level population of O v*J=0, i.e.,
n(O v*J=0), dominates, and n(O v*J=1) and n(O v*J=2)
keep increasing as ne grows in this region. In the log(ne)
range between 5 and 9, n(O v*J=2) > n(O v*J=0) >
n(O v*J=1). n(O v*J=0) is populated quickly for high
ne, and ﬁnally reachs equilibrium at log(ne) > 12, where
n(O v*J=2) > n(O v*J=1) > n(O v*J=0).

We observed signiﬁcant absorption troughs at the ex-
pected locations of the O v* transitions. The best-ﬁtting

troughs in S2. The velocity center for this system is marked as the
black dashed line at –7500 km s−1. The normalized spectrum is
shown in green for the 2011 epoch and purple for the 2017 one.
The best-ﬁtting model for S2 is shown in black solid lines. For the
Ne viii and Mg x doublets, both the data and model are consistent
with signiﬁcant saturation. For Ca vi λ641.90, we show the model
for Ca vi and the intervening systems as the orange solid and gray
dotted lines, respectively. For Mg x λ609.79, we show the model for
Mg x as an orange solid line, where contaminating troughs of O iv
λ608.40 from S1b (the Gaussian centered at v = –6600 km s−1)
and S2 (the Gaussian centered at v = –8200 km s−1) are shown as
gray dotted lines. See section 4.2.1 for details.

and errors for the 2017 epoch. For each subplot, the red dashed
lines represent the models of the O v* multiplet for a particular ne,
while the black solid lines are the summation of all models in this
region. The sharp features at ∼1466.5 ˚A, 1469.0 ˚A and 1470.0 ˚A
are intervening systems. We label the four panels as 1 – 4 at
the bottom-right corner. See section 4.2.3 for a detailed discussion.

the model overestimates the data (see panel 4). We get
the best ﬁt when log(ne) = 5.8. Therefore, log(ne) =
5.8+0.5
−0.3.
Besides O v*, we observed troughs from other density
sensitive transitions. However, they are either situated
in a saturated region (Ne v* λ572.33 and O iv* λ790.20),
or too weak to form a signiﬁcant trough (S iv* λ661.40
and the corresponding S iv at 657.32 ˚A). From the best-
ﬁtting photoionization solution model with the above-
determined ne, we are able to predict absorption troughs
that are consistent with the data in the expected regions
of these transitions.

4.3. Outﬂow System 3 (v = –9940 km s−1)
S3 also shows absorption troughs from both high- and
very high-ionization species. We show the data and the
best-ﬁtting SSS models in ﬁgure 10. For the O iv + Mg x-
b region, the blue dotted lines are for the O iv λ608.340
and O iv* λ609.83 troughs while the red dotted line is for
the Mg x λ609.79 trough. For the Ca vii + Mg x-r region,
the cyan and red dotted lines are for the Ca vii λ624.28
and Mg x λ624.94 troughs, respectively. These two re-
gions fall in the gap of the HST/COS G140L grating in
the 2011 epoch. For the Ar viii-r and Ar vi region, their
modeled troughs are shown as orange dotted lines. The
Ar viii-r trough is consistent with the shallow observed
absorption and is contaminated by the Ar viii λ700.24
trough from S1a (centered at -10,600 km s−1 in the top-
right panel of ﬁgure 10). Therefore, the AOD Nion from
the Ar viii-r trough is treated as an upper limit. The
higher velocity wing of the Ar vi λ754.93 trough is con-
taminated by the Ne viii λ780.32 trough from S4, while
S4 shows variability between the 2011 and 2017 epochs.
We discuss this varibility in Paper IV.

We report the measured Nion in table 4 and the best-
ﬁtting photoinoization solution from the SSS model in

tions for the 3PJ levels of the 2s2p term of O+4 are plotted as a

dotted lines, respectively. We show the temperature dependence of
n(O v*)/n(O v) by presenting three diﬀerent temperature curves.

photoionzation solution from SSS model predicts that the
total log[N(O v)] = 17.02 cm−2, with the ratio of contri-
butions from the HP and VHP as ∼ 1:2. The Cloudy pre-
dicted temperature for the HP and VHP are around Tlow
= 21,000 K and Thigh = 44,000 K, respectively. Due to
the strong temperature dependence of n(O v*)/n(O v),
the VHP produces 20 times more N(O v*)/N(O v) com-
pared to the HP. Overall, most (∼97.5%) of the O v*
observed in the spectrum is from the VHP.

In order to ﬁt the observed O v* region, we adopt the
model predicted value for N(O v) and temperature Thigh.
We vary log(ne) from 5 to 13, in steps of 0.1 dex and show
some of the ﬁts to this range in ﬁgure 9. The black and
gray histograms are the normalized ﬂux and error for the
2017 epoch, respectively. The red dashed lines are the
models for the O v* multiplet with the corresponding J
values. The vertical line below each J value indicates
the relative f of the line. We note that there are several
“contaminations” from intervening systems at 1466.5 ˚A,
1469.0 ˚A and 1470.0 ˚A.

Despite all of the intervening systems, we can still es-
timate ne as shown in ﬁgure 9. The lower limit is deter-
mined at log(ne) = 5.5, where the model clearly under-
estimates the data by more than 1σ (see panel 1 and 2).
The upper limit is determined to be log(ne) = 6.3, where

Using the ne determination for each outﬂow system,
we can solve equation (1) for R. We then determine the
mass ﬂow rate ( ˙M ) and the kinetic luminosity ( ˙Ek) by
assuming the outﬂow is in the form of a thin and partially
ﬁlled shell (see elaboration in Borguet et al. 2012a):

where Ω is the global covering factor, i.e., the portion
of the full solid angle covered by the outﬂow (for SDSS
J1042+1646, we use Ω = 0.2, see discussion in section
6.3), µ = 1.4 is the mean atomic mass per proton, mp is
the proton mass, and v is the velocity of the outﬂow.

Since the Mg ii emission region for SDSS J1042+1646
is observed by SDSS, we follow the Mg ii–based black-
hole mass estimators (calibrated with Hβ reverberation
measurement, see sequation (7) and table (4) in Bahk et
al. 2019) to derive a black hole mass of 109.3 and corre-
sponding Eddington luminosity, LEdd = 1047.4 erg s−1.
We then calculate the ratio of the outﬂow’s kinetic lumi-
nosity to the LEdd, i.e., ΓEdd ≡ ˙Ek/LEdd.

In table 5, we show all the physical parameters for the
outﬂows we extracted from the data.
In the ﬁrst part
of the table 5, we show the derived photoionization solu-
tions, ne, fV (volume ﬁlling factor, see section 6.1.2), and
the energetics for the four outﬂows analyzed in section
4. We show the “shading eﬀect” results in the second
part of the table (see section 6.2). Finally, we compare
our derived physical parameters to two other energetic
outﬂows in the third part of the table (see discussion in
section 6.3).

6. DISCUSSION
6.1. The Two-phase Outﬂows
6.1.1. Prevalence of Outﬂows with a VHP

Two ionization phase outﬂows have been reported and
discussed in detail for quasar HE0238–1904 (see section
8 in Arav et al. 2013). Their lower ionization phase (sim-
ilar to HP in this paper) was mainly constrained by the
Nion from H i and O iv, while the higher-ionization phase
(similar to VHP in this paper) was constrained by the
Nion from O vi, Mg x, and Ne viii. Similarly, all of the
outﬂows analyzed here (S1a, S1b, S2, and S3) as well
as the 8 EUV500 outﬂows reported in three additional
quasars (see Paper I), necessitate an HP and a VHP. All
of these outﬂows show O iv troughs and therefore should
have C iv 1549 ˚A troughs. Thus, these outﬂows would
be classiﬁed as HiBALs if observed in rest-frame wave-
lengths, λrest > 1050 ˚A (see section 4.5 in Paper I). The
existence of a VHP in all outﬂows from these quasars
suggests that all HiBALs have VHPs, which is not prac-
ticably accessible with ground-based telescopes (see sec-
tion 1). The selection criteria of the EUV500 sample do
not aﬀect the extrapolation of these results to the gen-
eral HiBAL outﬂow population (see section 4.1 in Paper
1). As shown in table 1 of Paper I (for all 13 outﬂows
described in Paper II – VI), the VHP has 6 – 100 times
higher NH than the HP, which indicates that the VHP
also carries the bulk of the material in the outﬂows.

Figure 10. Comparison of the data with the SSS models for the
absorption troughs in S3. The velocity center for this system is the
black dashed line at –9940 km s−1. The normalized spectrum is
shown in green for the 2011 epoch and purple for the 2017 one. The
best-ﬁtting SSS models combining all outﬂow systems are shown
as black solid lines. See section 4.3 for details.

Figure 11. The best-ﬁtting photoionization solution for S3. All
patterns and labels are the same as ﬁgure 4.

ﬁgure 11. All observed outﬂow absorption troughs are
well ﬁtted by a two-phase ionization model. The ob-
served amount N(Ca vii) originates from both the HP
and VHP, with a ratio of ∼ 1:3, respectively. Therefore,
Ca vii gives constraints to both phases. The HP yields
log(NH) = 20.69+0.34
−0.31. This
solution is constrained by the O iv and Ar vi troughs,
as well as the Ca vii trough. The VHP gives log(NH)
= 21.54+0.17
−0.07. This solution is
constrained mainly by the measured Nion of the Mg x
doublet and Ca vii, and the upper limit of Ar viii. Com-
paring between the 2011 and 2017 epochs, the troughs of
S3 show no variations.

−0.28 and log(UH) = –0.67+0.21

−0.18 and log(UH) = 0.09+0.08

We do not observe measurable absorption troughs from
density diagnostic transitions for S3. Therefore, the ne
of S3 is undetermined.

6.1.2. Volume Filling Factor

Kinematic similarities (both velocity and width cen-
troid) between troughs from the HP and the VHP sug-
gest that these two phases are co-spatial. For each phase
(HP or VHP), the volume is proportional to NH/nH, and
the nH ratio between the HP and the VHP is given by
UH,V HP /UH,HP . Therefore, the volume ﬁlling factor be-
tween the two phases is deﬁned as (see section 8.1 in Arav
et al. 2013):

fV ≡

VHP
VV HP

=

NH,HP
NH,V HP

×

UH,HP
UH,V HP

(6)

where V is the volume of the outﬂows, and the sub-
scripts HP and VHP denotes the high-ionization phase
and very high-ionization phase, respectively. For the out-
ﬂows in quasar HE0238–1904, the VHP has log(UH) 2 –
3 dexes higher and log(NH) 2 – 2.5 dexes higher than
the HP. Therefore, the HP is inferred to have log (fV ) ∼
–4 to –6 compared to the VHP. Thus, Arav et al. (2013)
reached the conclusion that the VHP carries much more
material than the HP and is closer to the situation seen
in X-ray warm absorbers (e.g., Netzer et al. 2003; Gabel
et al. 2005). We show the fV values for the outﬂows in
SDSS J1042+1646 in table 5.

6.1.3. Comparisons with Warm Absorbers

In our case, two ionization-phase solutions are suﬃ-
cient for ﬁtting all the observed outﬂow features, but it
does not exclude more ionization phases. As shown in X-
ray warm absorber studies, AGN outﬂows can span up
to 5 orders of magnitude in ionization parameter, i.e.,
–1 < log(ξ) < 4 (Steenbrugge et al. 2003; Costantini
et al. 2007; Holczer et al. 2007; McKernan et al. 2007;
Behar 2009), where ξ is the X-ray ionization parame-
ter and for the HE0238 SED, log(UH) = log(ξ) – 1.3.
Moreover, studies in X-ray invoked a continuous distri-
bution of NH as a function of ξ (Holczer et al. 2007).
The observed absorption features in SDSS J1042+1646
are well ﬁtted with just two ionization phases. How-
ever, future sensitive X-ray spectroscopy with observa-
tories such as Athena (Barcons et al. 2017) may reveal
additional higher-ionization phases and/or the necessity
of a continuous distribution of NH as a function of UH.

6.2. “Shading Eﬀect” of Diﬀerent Outﬂow Systems
Since we have multiple outﬂow systems along the line
of sight at diﬀerent distances, the inner outﬂows would
absorb photons from the central AGN and could change
the SED incident on the outer outﬂows. This is called the
“Shading Eﬀect” (Sun et al. 2017) and here we quantify
its eﬀect on our derived photoionization solutions. We
show our results when the outﬂow is directly exposed to
the HE0238 SED in the ﬁrst part of table 5. Outﬂow
S2 has a smaller R compared to the other systems, and
its high NH could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the SED seen by
other outﬂows. Therefore, we test the shading covered
by S2 here and compare it to the original results using
the unshaded HE0238 SED.

Our model predicts that S2 has two ionization phases.
We input the HE0238 SED and calculate the transmit-
ted SED after passing through S2’s VHP and HP to get
SEDTran.VHP and SEDTran.HP, respectively. We show

15

Figure 12. Comparison of the transmitted SEDs (in blue solid
lines) to HE0238 SED (in black solid lines). Top: We show the
transmitted SED emerging from the very high- and high-ionization
phase of outﬂow S2 as blue and red lines, respectively. Bottom:
We show the transmitted SED emerging from the high-ionization
phase of outﬂow S2 when it is illuminated by SEDTran.VHP.
In
both plots, we indicate the location of the ionization potentials of
the main species by the vertical dotted lines. See detailed discus-
sions in section 6.2.

these two transmitted SEDs in the top panel of ﬁgure
12 as blue and red lines, respectively. The unshaded
HE0238 SED is plotted as the solid black line. The
SEDTran.VHP shows a reduction of ﬂux ∼ 0.3 dex near
the He ii edge; and further reduction of ﬂux ∼ 1 dex from
100 eV to 1 keV, which is mainly caused by metal absorp-
tions. The SEDTran.HP has a minimal reduction while the
largest change is ∼ 0.1 dex near the He ii edge. To check
the total “Shading Eﬀect”, we test the scenario where
SEDTran.VHP is incident on the HP of S2. As shown in
the bottom panel of ﬁgure 12, considering the shading
from both phases (purple lines) only aﬀects the SED by
an additional 10% compared to the SEDTran.VHP (blue
lines in the top panel).

We use these transmitted SEDs as the input SEDs to
generate new grids of models with Cloudy. Based on
these models and the same method reported in section
4, we ﬁnd new photoionization solutions for the shaded
systems S1a, S1b, and S3. We then calculate new QH
values using the transmitted SEDs and calculate the out-
ﬂows’ R, and energetics accordingly [see equations (1),
(4), (5)]. We compare these solutions to the un-shaded
results in table 5, where the second part of the table is

16

for the photoionization solutions from SEDTran.VHP. We
ﬁnd that when considering the “Shading Eﬀect” with the
SEDTran.VHP, we get a larger log(UH) by ∼ 0.3 – 1.0 dex
and a larger log(NH) by ∼ 0.1 – 0.5 dex. This is because
the shading of S2 decreases the amount of hydrogen ion-
izing photons, so a higher UH is needed to keep a similar
ionization state as the unshaded case. The new UH and
˙M and
NH values lead to a decrease of ∼ 0.1 dex in R,
˙Ek.
6.3. AGN Feedback Eﬀects and Global Covering Factor
As shown in section 1, signiﬁcant AGN feedback typi-
cally requires high ˙Ek, where ΓEdd is at least 0.5 (Hop-
kins & Elvis 2010) or 5% (Scannapieco & Oh 2004).
˙M and ˙Ek are linearly
Equations (4) and (5) show that
dependent on the solid angle subtended by the outﬂows
around the source (4πΩ). Since there are no direct spec-
troscopic determinations for Ω, the common approach is
to use the detection frequency of outﬂows in surveys as
a proxy. In SDSS J1042+1646, the most energetic out-
˙M and ˙Ek are
ﬂow is S1b. Based on our analysis results,
given by:

˙M (cid:39) Ω × 8600 M(cid:12) yr−1

(7)

˙Ek (cid:39) Ω × 2.5 × 1047 erg s−1
(8)
Multiple surveys have been done to ﬁnd that C iv
BALs appear in approximately 20% of all quasars (e.g.,
Hewett & Foltz 2003; Dai et al. 2008, 2012; Gibson et al.
2009; Allen et al. 2011). The outﬂows reported here are
consistent with C iv BALs since we observed absorption
troughs from O iv λ787.71 which has a similar IP to C iv
λ1548.19. Moreover, the populations of C iv and O iv are
similar over a broad range of UH (see ﬁgure 12 in Muza-
hid et al. 2013). Also, using the classiﬁcation scheme in
Paper I and the widths of their Ne viii absorption trough
widths in table 2, all of the outﬂows here are BALs ex-
cept for S3 which is a mini-BAL. Therefore, Ω of these
outﬂows should be similar to that assumed for C iv BAL
outﬂows. Thus, we adopt an Ω = 0.2 and this lead to
˙M = 4300 M(cid:12) yr−1 and ˙Ek = 1046.7 erg s−1 for outﬂow
S1b. These are the largest ˙M and ˙Ek reported for quasar
outﬂows to date.

The former records are ˙M ∼ 3500 M(cid:12) yr−1(Maiolino
et al. 2012) and ˙Ek ∼ 1045.9 erg s−1 (Chamberlain et
al. 2015). Moreover, S1b has a ˙Ek ∼ 20% of its LEdd.
With this high ΓEdd, S1b can be the dominate sources
of energy for AGN feedback in the host galaxy of SDSS
J1042+1646 (Scannapieco & Oh 2004).

˙M = 2800+200

Similarly, for component 1a, this yields R = 840+500
−300
pc,
−0.1 erg
s−1. Combining S1a and S1b, outﬂow S1 has an ˙Ek close
to 1047.0 erg s−1 and ΓEdd close to 30%.

−800 M(cid:12) yr−1 and log( ˙Ek) = 46.4+0.1

6.4. Eﬀects of the Super Solar Metallicity
AGN outﬂows can exhibit super solar metallicity
(SSM) (e.g., Arav et al. 2007; Gabel et al. 2006). Paper
V discusses the quantitative eﬀects of SSM on the in-
ferred parameters for outﬂows observed in the EUV500.

Unlike the case shown in Paper V, the photoionization
solutions of S1, S2, and S3 in SDSS J1042+1646 are con-
sistent with solar metallicity. To estimate the eﬀects of
possible SSM on S1, S2, and S3, we follow approach from
Paper V and compute the analysis results for two metal-
licity values: solar (Z(cid:12)) and 4.7 times solar (4.7Z(cid:12)). For
outﬂow system 1 and 2, the results based on 4.7Z(cid:12) leads
to a decrease of distance by up to 30% and decreases of
˙M and ˙Ek by up to a factor of 6. However, the good-
ness of the ﬁt (determined by their χ2) for all models
is comparable, so the ﬁts cannot provide a metallicity
constraint.

7. SUMMARY
In this paper, we presented the analysis of HST/COS
spectra for the quasar outﬂows seen in SDSS J1042+1646
in the EUV500 (500 – 1050 ˚A rest-frame) region. The
results are summarized as follows:

1. A total of ﬁve outﬂow systems are identiﬁed (S1
– S4, where S1 has two components: S1a and S1b).
From these outﬂows, we observed absorption troughs
from both high-ionization species, e.g., O iv, and S iv,
and very high-ionization species, e.g., Ar viii, Ne viii,
Na ix, and Mg x. Four out of the ﬁve outﬂows are de-
ﬁned as BAL outﬂows while the other (S3) is a mini-BAL
outﬂow (see section 3.2).

2. We developed the Synthetic Spectral Simula-
tion method to eﬃciently ﬁt the multitude of observed
troughs with a three-dimensional model grid in the pa-
rameter space of UH, NH, and ne. This method is
especially powerful when handling blended absorption
troughs from many EUV500 species (>70), and inter-
vening absorption troughs (see section 3.3).

3. The appearance of the very high-ionization species
necessitates at least two-ionization phase solutions for
the observed outﬂows. Combining with previous studies,
we suggest that all HiBALs have very high-ionization
phases, which are almost exclusively accessible with
EUV500 observations from HST (see section 4).

4. With determining ne from density sensitive transi-
tions, we found the distances and energetics for 3 out of
˙Ek close to 1047.0
the 5 outﬂows. Outﬂow system 1 has
erg s−1, which is the most energetic outﬂow observed
in quasars to date. Moreover, this leads to an ˙Ek/LEdd
close to 30%, which makes it a good candidate for being
the agent of quasar-mode AGN feedback (see section 5).
5. When we take into account the attenuation of ion-
izing ﬂux by interior outﬂow systems, we ﬁnd a decrease
of ∼ 0.1 dex in R,

˙M and ˙Ek (see section 6.2).
