Time-dependent coupled-cluster method with time-varying orbital functions, called time-dependent optimized coupled-
cluster (TD-OCC) method, is formulated for multielectron dynamics in an intense laser ﬁeld. We have successfully
derived equations of motion for CC amplitudes and orthonormal orbital functions based on the real action functional,
and implemented the method including double excitations (TD-OCCD) and double and triple excitations (TD-OCCDT)
within the optimized active orbitals. The present method is size extensive and gauge invariant, a polynomial cost-scaling
alternative to the time-dependent multiconﬁguration self-consistent-ﬁeld method. The ﬁrst application of the TD-OCC
method to intense-laser driven correlated electron dynamics in Ar atom is reported.

INTRODUCTION

The strong-ﬁeld physics and ultrafast science are rapidly
progressing towards a world-changing goal to directly mea-
sure and control the electron motion in matters.1–5 Reliable
theoretical and computational methods are indispensable to
understand and predict strong-ﬁeld and ultrafast phenomena,
which frequently involve both bound excitations and ioniza-
tions, where dynamical electron correlation plays a key role.
One of the most advanced methods to describe such
electron dynamics is the multiconﬁguration time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) method,6–9 and more generally the
time-dependent multiconﬁguration self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-
MCSCF) method.10,11 In TD-MCSCF, the electronic wave-
function is given by the conﬁguration-interaction (CI) ex-
pansion, ΨCI(t) =
I CI(t)ΦI(t), and both CI coefﬁci-
ets {CI(t)} and occupied spin-orbital functions {ψp(t)} con-
stituting the Slater determinants {ΦI(t)} are propagated in
time.
(Hereafter spin-orbital functions are simply referred
to as orbitals. See, e.g, Refs. 12–15 for TDCI methods us-
ing ﬁxed orbitals, and Ref. 11 for a broad review of ab ini-
tio wavefunction-based methods for multielectron dynamics.)
Though powerful, the full CI-based MCTDHF method suf-
fers from the factorial scaling of the computational cost with
respect to the number of electrons, which restricts its applica-
bility to the systems of moderate size.

(cid:80)

The time-dependent complete-active-space self-consistent-
ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF) method16 signiﬁcantly reduces the cost
by ﬂexibly classifying occupied orbitals into frozen-core,
dynamical-core, and active orbitals as deﬁned in Fig. 1. More
approximate and thus less demanding models have been ac-
tively investigated,17–20 which rely on the truncaed CI expan-
sion within the active orbitals given, e.g, as

implementations19,21–28 have proved a great utility of these
methods, all the methods based on a truncated-CI expansion
share a common drawback of not being size extensive.29,30

Therefore one naturally seeks an alternative to Eq. (1),
where the truncated CI is replaced with the size-extensize

was recently put forward by Kvaal37, who, based on Arpo-
nen’s seminal work,38 developed a time-dependent coupled-
cluster method using time-varying biorthonormal orbitals,
called orbital-adapted time-dependent coupled-cluster (OAT-

DCC) method, and applied it to the collision problem in a
one-dimensional model Hamiltonian. This method, however,
has a difﬁculty in obtaining the ground state of the system, re-
quired as an initial state of simulations, and has not yet been
applied to real three-dimensional or time-dependent Hamil-
tonian. We also notice recent investigations on the time-
dependent coupled-cluster methods using ﬁxed orbitals.39,40
Their primary focus, however, has been placed on retrieving
spectral information rather than the time-domain electron dy-
namics itself.

In this communication we report our successful formulation
and implementation of the time-dependent coupled-cluster
method using time-varying orthonormal orbitals, called time-
dependent optimized coupled-cluster (TD-OCC) method, and
present its ﬁrst application to electron dynamics of Ar atom
subject to an intense laser ﬁeld. The Hartree atomic units are
used throughout unless otherwise noted.

(20)

that is, with single amplitudes ˆT1 and ˆΛ1 omitted. The same
form has been adopted in the ground-state OCC methods33–35
and OATDCC method. We have also tried to retain single
amplitudes ( ˆT = ˆT1 + ˆT2 + · · · , ˆΛ = ˆΛ1 + ˆΛ2 + · · · )
and apply TDVP of the previous section. However, the re-
sultant EOMs were stable neither in real time nor imaginary
time propagation.43 A similar difﬁculty has been reported for
the stationary OCC method,33 which is in essence due to the
similar physical roles played by single excitations and hole-
particle rotations.

the direct consequece of relying on the real action functional
with orthonormal orbitals.

TD-OCC METHOD

In order to derive a working equation for the hole-particle
rotations {X a

one has to specify a particular ansatz of the CC Lagrangian,

a The overlap, one-electron, and two-electron repulsion integrals over
gaussian basis functions are generated using Gaussian09 program
(Ref. 44), and used to propagate EOMs in imaginary time in the
orthonormalized gaussian basis, with a convergence threshold of 10-15
Hartree of energy difference in subsequent time steps.

A special simpliﬁcation arises when only double amplitudes
are included, in which case Eq. (22) and the last two terms of
Eq. (23) vanish, and ˆX needs not be included in Eqs. (13) and
(14).

In summary, the TD-OCC EOMs consist of Eq. (13) for
ˆT2, ˆT3, · · · , Eq. (14) for ˆΛ2, ˆΛ3 · · · , and Eq. (15) for orbitals,
with {X a
i } obtained by solving Eq. (21). The present TD-
OCC method is, as the name suggests, a direct time-dependent
extension of the stationary OCC method33–35.

FEASIBILITY OF IMAGINARY RELAXATION METHOD

We have implemented the TD-OCC method with double
excitations (TD-OCCD) and double and triple excitations
(TD-OCCDT) for atom-centered gaussian basis functions and
the atomic Hamiltonian with ﬁnite-element discrete variable
representation (FEDVR) basis25,28. These codes share the
same implementation for the basis-independent procedures
[Eqs. (13), (14), (17)-(19), (21)-(23)].

It turns out, in contrast to the OATDCC method, that the
imaginary-time relaxation is feasible for the TD-OCC method
to obtain the ground state, which is quite convenient when
using grids or locally-supported basis like FEDVR to ex-
pand orbitals. This is conﬁrmed in table I, which compares
the total energies of the ground state of BH molecule with
double-ζ plus polarization (DZP) basis45 obtained by imagi-
nary time propagation with results of corresponding stationary
methods35. The OCC and CASSCF methods correlate all six
electrons among six active orbitals. The agreement of OCCD

ods predicted qualitatively similar spectra, with a minimum
at 53 eV (≈ 34th order, indicated with an arrow) close to
the Cooper minimum of photoionization spectrum,47 which
was experimentally observed.48 The TDHF method, however,
failed to reproduce ﬁne structures of the TD-CASSCF spec-
trum especially at higher plateau as seen in the inset of Fig. 2.
The description is largely improved by TD-OCCD, and the
TD-OCCDT spectrum well reproduces the TD-CASSCF one
in virtually all details.

We also compare the probabilities of ﬁnding one [Fig. 3 (a)]
and two [Fig. 3 (b)] electron(s) outside a sphere of radius
R0 = 20, which measure the single and double ionization
probabilities, respectively. These probabilites are much more
sensitive to the description of correlated motions of elec-
trons than HHG, which hinders a correct description with
TDHF. The rapid converngence of TD-OCC results to the TD-
CASSCF ones for such nonperturbatively nonlinear processes
strongly promises the TD-OCC method to be a vital tool to
investigate correlated high-ﬁeld phenomena.

SUMMARY

We have successfully formulated a new time-dependent
coupled-cluster method called TD-OCC method, and imple-
mented the ﬁrst two, and the most important, series of approx-
imations, TD-OCCD and TD-OCCDT. The present method is
size extensive and gauge invariant, a polynomial cost-scaling
alternative to the TD-MCSCF method.
It would open new
possibilities of high-accuracy ﬁrst-principle investigations of

clearly demonstrates our correct implementation and the fea-
sibility of the imaginary-time method.

INITIAL APPLICATIONS

Finally we report our initial application of the TD-OCC
method to Ar atom in a strong laser ﬁeld. We used the spher-
ical FEDVR basis given as the product Ylm(θ, φ)fk(r) of
spherical harmonics Ylm with l ≤ lmax and the FEDVR ba-
sis fk(r), which divides the range of radial coordinate 0 <
r < Rmax into ﬁnite elements of length 4 (with several ﬁner
elements near the nuclei), each supporting 23 local DVR func-
tions. We ﬁrst obtained the ground states of TDHF, TD-OCC,
and TD-CASSCF methods by the imaginary time relaxation.
For the latter two methods, the Ne core was kept frozen at HF
orbitals and eight valence electrons were correlated among 13
optimized active orbitals, with their initial characters being
3s3p3d4p4s. Starting from the ground states, we then simu-
lated the electron dynamics of Ar atom subject to a linearly
polarized (in the z direction) laser pulse with a wavelength of
800 nm, a peak intensity of 6×1014 W/cm2, and a foot-to-foot
pulse duration of three optical cycles with a sin2-shaped enve-
lope, within the dipole approximation in the velocity gauge.
The EOMs are propageted using the fourth-order exponen-
tial Runge-Kutta method.46 The Ne core was frozen in all the
methods and 13 active orbitals were propagated in TD-OCC
and TD-CASSCF methods. The basis parameters were cal-
ibrated to achieve convergence with Rmax = 240 (with the
absorbing boundary25) and lmax = 63.
