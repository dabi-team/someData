Key Points:

• We examine MAVEN NGIMS neutral data for evidence of sputtering due to ion pre-

cipitation

• The data is converted to Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates so location indicates solar

wind direction

• Density changes in MSE coordinates are suggestive of an eﬀect but need more data to

Abstract
The Martian upper atmosphere is known to vary diurnally and seasonally due to changing
amounts of solar radiation. However, in the upper thermosphere and exosphere, the neu-
trals are also subject to ion precipitation. This can increase the temperature in the region
of precipitation, resulting in density changes that might be seen in in situ data [Fang et al.,
2013]. Therefore, we examine neutral density data from the MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion
Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) in Mars-Solar-Electric (MSE) coordinates, where location is
determined by the direction of the solar wind convective electric ﬁeld, resulting in a hemi-
spherical asymmetry in the ion precipitation. By examining densities in MSE coordinates
[Hara et al., 2017] we are able to look for a detectable eﬀect in the region where ion pre-
cipitation is more likely. Using the NGIMS neutral data and Key Parameters in situ solar
wind data from February 2015 to August 2017 we look for asymmetries by constructing aver-
age density maps in Mars-Solar-Orbital (MSO) and MSE coordinates near the exobase. The
NGIMS densities for O, Ar, and CO2 from 180-220 km altitude for each orbit are averaged
and then binned by location in MSO coordinates and transformed to MSE coordinates. The
resulting MSE map exhibits a small density increase in the southern hemisphere, where one
would expect to see enhanced precipitation. Although suggestive, the change is not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant, so that the eﬀect of ion precipitation, thought to be an important driver in
the evolution of Mars’ atmosphere remains elusive.

1 Introduction

The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission seeks to both under-
stand the structure of Mars’ current atmosphere and ascertain how much of this atmosphere
has been lost to space over time, known as atmospheric escape [Jakosky et al., 2015]. The
Sun, and subsequently the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that ﬂows oﬀ of the Sun,
can aﬀect the atmosphere and drive escape in several ways. For example, the interplanetary
magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) carried in the solar wind will pick up ions in the ionosphere, which can
then be lost by ﬂowing down the magnetospheric tail [Curry et al., 2015]. However, while
many of the ions picked up by the IMF are accelerated away from the planet, some reen-
ter the atmosphere in a process known as pick-up ion precipitation [Johnson and Luhmann,
1998]. The precipitating ions can then collide with and transfer energy to the neutral atmo-
sphere. Non-thermal collisions can result in sputtering, a splashing out eﬀect on the neutrals
which has been suggested to be responsible for much of early neutral atmospheric escape
[Leblanc and Johnson, 2002]. However, it is now estimated to be a very small part of the
present escape rate and as such is diﬃcult to directly detect in MAVEN data [Leblanc et al.,
2015]. Since the energy transfer from precipitating ion and neutral collisions can raise the
temperature of the atmosphere, and hence the scale height, leading to an increase in den-
sity, here we use the changes in the average density in the exobase region as a proxy for the
pick-up ion heating. Precipitation is an ongoing process even during quiet solar conditions
[Leblanc et al., 2015; Hara et al., 2017], so in this paper we look at average densities at a
given altitude range to see if there is at present an eﬀect from precipitation.

The neutral densities in this paper were obtained by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass

Spectrometer (NGIMS) on MAVEN, a quadrupole mass spectrometer that measures in situ
densities every orbit. NGIMS provides a unique opportunity to study upper atmospheric
composition, as it has now measured densities between the nominal altitudes of approxi-
mately 150-350 km for over a full Martian year. This provides a large dataset for analysis of
the neutral densities in the altitude regime where the atmosphere transitions from collisional
to ballistic and neutral escape becomes more likely. Since ion precipitation is correlated with
the direction of the solar wind convective electric ﬁeld, it is more likely when the ﬁeld is
directed towards the planet [Brain et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2013; Hara et al., 2017]. Thus
examining neutral densities in a frame of reference dependent on the direction of said elec-
tric ﬁeld, the Mars-Solar-Electric Field coordinates (MSE), can help in trying to understand
how and if ions driven by the solar wind can contribute to neutral escape. We also use Mars-
Solar-Orbital (MSO) coordinates, which are useful for both atmospheric data and data taken

farther from the planet, such as in the upstream solar wind, unlike geodetic coordinates, as a
control comparison.

In MSE coordinates, the ’southern’ latitudes indicate the electric ﬁeld is pointed to-
wards the planet, while ’northern’ latitudes indicate the electric ﬁeld is pointed away from
the planet. Therefore precipitation predominately occurs in the southern MSE, or -E hemi-
sphere, whereas ions ﬂow out in the northern MSE latitudes or +E hemisphere. Transform-
ing the neutral data to this coordinate system allows us to examine the eﬀect on the neutrals
of the potential presence of ion precipitation. We do this by comparing measured densities
where precipitation is occurring with densities where precipitating ions are probably not pro-
viding additional energy to the neutral atmosphere.

We calculate average densities for oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide between 180 and
220 km, then map these averages in MSO coordinates. We then use the upstream solar wind
proton ﬂow velocity and IMF vectors to calculate the solar wind convective electric ﬁeld di-
rection and use this to ﬁnd MSE coordinates. As such, we will presume that changes in den-
sity in this altitude range between the northern and southern hemispheres are most likely
due to the transfer of energy from precipitating ions in the southern -E hemisphere. The ab-
sence of a clear eﬀect would suggest that ion precipitation is not aﬀecting the neutrals. We
also look at the data for diﬀerent solar longitudes, to compare with global circulation mod-
els of the neutral atmosphere in order to ascertain if there is a seasonal eﬀect. While we do
not see any clear diﬀerence between seasonal densities in the data and previous model results
(e.g. Bougher et al. [2015]), we do see a suggestion that average neutral densities are slightly
higher in areas where precipitation likely occurs. Although the evidence is not statistically
signiﬁcant, it is suggestive and could become clearer with additional data.

2 Methods

This study uses the publicly available NGIMS level 2, version 7, revision 3 data from
February 2015 to August 2017, slightly more than a full Martian year, for a total of 3828 or-
bits. NGIMS is a quadrupole mass spectrometer that measures in situ ion and neutral counts
for a range of 2-150 amu with 1 amu resolution every orbit. Both ion and neutrals counts are
measured by NGIMS in channels for mass-to-charge ratio in a 2.6 s cadence [Benna and El-
rod, 2017]. The counts from each mass channel are converted to abundances in particles per
cubic centimeter vs. altitude, time, latitude, and longitude of the measurement in the instru-
ments level 2 data ﬁles.

MSO coordinates refer to a Mars-ﬁxed solar-pointing coordinate system, with the X
vector pointing towards the Sun, the Y vector anti-parallel to the direction of the orbit, and
the Z vector completing the orthogonal system [Vignes et al., 2000]. In the MSE coordi-
nate system, the X unit vector maintains the same direction, but the XZ plane is deﬁned by
the direction of the positive solar electric ﬁeld, with the Z unit vector chosen to be along the
electric ﬁeld direction and orthogonal to the X and Y vectors. To deﬁne MSE coordinates,
we use the Key Parameters (KP) version 12, revision 1 dataset, which includes data from the
Particles and Fields instrument package onboard MAVEN [Dunn, 2015]. The Solar Wind
Ion Analyzer (SWIA) provides the proton ﬂow velocity vector, while the magnetometer pro-
vides the IMF vector, giving us the background convection electric ﬁeld from (cid:174)E = −(cid:174)v × (cid:174)B.
However, due to its precessing orbit, MAVEN does not always sample the solar wind directly
when its apoapsis is on the night side of the planet, so we remove those orbits from our study
by examining the proton ﬂow velocities and magnetic ﬁeld signatures in the KP data, as has
been done previously [Halekas et al., 2017]. Both proton ﬂow velocities and magnetic ﬁeld
vectors are chosen to be the average values above 4000 km, to ensure that we are using solar
wind values rather than those in the ionosphere.

To look at changes in average neutral density near the exobase for a variety of solar
wind conditions, we compare densities for species O, Ar, and CO2 in the 180-220 km altitude
range. This is generally at or just above the region where the atmosphere transitions from
being dominated by collisions to becoming ballistic. By looking at this altitude range, we
can examine neutrals that might be heated by incident particle ﬂux to suﬃcient temperatures

to aﬀect the escape rate from the planet’s gravity well. Ar was chosen because it is chem-
ically inert, meaning it does not undergo photochemical processes, while O and CO2 were
chosen due to their dominance at the altitudes of interest. For each orbit we average the mea-
sured densities for each species over altitudes 180-220 km. These averages are then separated
into location bins of 5 degrees latitude and longitude in MSO and MSE coordinates, then the
mean is found for each bin to produce the average density maps. This eﬀectively normalizes
the data by data density, reducing any bias due to multiple observations in the same location.
Data is also split by solar longitude to examine seasonal neutral density variations outside of
those expected from GCM models [Bougher et al., 2014]. While we do not directly compute
temperature, neutral heating can be inferred from higher average densities, as an increase in
temperature will increase the scale height and hence we will see higher densities at a given
altitude.

3 Results

in the text: X pointing out from the plane towards the sun. Color indicates the log of the species density, with
panels indicating density for O, Ar, and CO2, respectively. Dayside, with noon at 0◦, is uniformly higher
density than the nightside (midnight at 180◦), although the magnitude of the diﬀerence varies with species.

Figure 1 shows the binned densities as described in 2 in MSO coordinates. We ob-

serve, as expected, a distinct diﬀerence in density between dayside, the center of the ﬁgure,
and nightside. For all three species, the density from subsolar point to antisolar point (or the
data closest to those points) decreases by a signiﬁcant amount. However, the highest density
for O is not exactly in the noon region, as would be expected from atmospheric models in
this altitude region [Bougher et al., 2014]. For Ar and CO2, the diﬀerence between nightside
and dayside at these altitudes is quite clear and is close to two orders of magnitude. This, not
surprisingly, is consistent with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in average temperature due primarily
to the eﬀect of UV heating. The density gradient across the terminators (±90◦) is relatively
steep, dropping approximately an order of magnitude for argon and carbon dioxide across
50◦ longitude. The density on the dayside and nightside is similar for the lighter species O
due to ballistic transport and atmospheric winds. There are several places where the MSO
paths cross, but do not have the same densities (for example, 0◦ longitude, −50◦ latitude).
This is due to changes in solar longitude between the passes.

planet in the negative Z plane (positive and negative latitudes, respectively). Here, unlike in ﬁgure 1, dayside

is on the left side of the plot and nightside is on the right sides.

Figure 2 shows the same data as ﬁgure 1 but plotted in MSE coordinates. The MSE
coordinates oﬀer much higher spatial coverage than MSO, due to MAVEN retracing simi-
lar paths in MSO coordinates. While there are more ﬁlled bins, the number of orbits per bin
on average is lower in ﬁgure 2. The MSE coordinates for a particular region in MSO coor-
dinates change frequently due to the transient nature of the solar wind and the ﬂapping of
the IMF. The highly variable Z coordinate in MSE gives much more latitudinal coverage re-
sulting in the near azimuthal symmetry. Because of the higher coverage, the general trends
observed in MSO coordinates for Ar and CO2 are easily seen: the dayside is higher density
at this altitude than the nightside. However, any ﬁner structure with respect to terminator or
high latitude changes in density is lost because MSE coordinates are largely independent of
geographic coordinates. The gap in the subsolar region is due to MAVEN not sampling the
solar wind when its periapsis is at low solar zenith angles. At those times, its apoapsis is in
the magnetotail or magnetosheath and so those data points are excluded, as the coordinate
transformation will not be valid. The MSE coordinates give the densities an artiﬁcial oval or
circular shape due to the rotation of the MSO coordinates with the solar wind electric ﬁeld
vector. So the circular spread represents rotation of similar locations in MSO for a variety of
solar wind and IMF directions.

Previous papers have shown the presence of an ion polar plume at the north MSE pole

[Dong et al., 2015] as a signiﬁcant source of ion escape. Because ions escaping from be-
low the exobase can also heat this region of the atmosphere, such a feature would appear
as a density enhancement in the northern MSE hemisphere. Additionally, ion precipitation
into the atmosphere has been shown to be more common on the dayside hemisphere, speciﬁ-
cally in the -E hemisphere [Brain et al., 2015; Hara et al., 2017], where the solar electric ﬁeld
points towards the planet. If this had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the neutrals it would appear as
an enhancement in the southern MSE hemisphere. Although the data density is not high, no
such enhancements are obvious in ﬁgure 2. Although it is possible that this would be more
evident with additional data, these data suggest the eﬀect of the incident plasma either does
not, on average, signiﬁcantly heat the neutrals in this altitude region or that the eﬀect is uni-
formly distributed. The eﬀect of the ions might be clearer if it was possible to have useful
solar wind data when MAVEN’s periapsis is on the dayside, thus providing data in the subso-
lar MSE coordinates region. Currently, the near noon dayside coverage is poorer than that on
the nightside.

To pursue this further, in ﬁgure 3 we bin the MSE density data for the Martian north-
ern hemisphere spring and southern hemisphere fall, i.e. solar longitude less than 90◦. Even
though the data is even more sparse, for spring the coverage is best near the terminators
and in the anti-solar region. We see the same general trends as in the entire dataset: day-
side hemispheric densities are higher than the nightside densities for Ar and CO2. However,
there is a suggestion that O seems to be higher density near 100◦ longitude, which would be
interesting as it matches model predictions quite well (e.g. Bougher et al. [2014]). This sug-
gests that longitudinal trends in the density at this altitude are visible for the diﬀerent species
in MSE coordinates and that the enhancement is not an artifact of the data processing. The
same local enhancement is roughly visible in Ar and CO2, which again would match global
circulation models. However, any seasonal changes beyond those present in models for the
neutral atmosphere near the exobase are not evident with the present data set.

Figure 4 shows the MSE binned data for northern summer and southern winter, which

is also sparse. During this solar longitude, Mars is near its apoapsis. Again, overall longi-
tudinal trends correspond roughly with those predicted by models. However, diurnal diﬀer-
ences for O and CO2 are higher than predicted [Bougher et al., 2014]. Speciﬁcally, the day-
side for O is about an order of magnitude higher in density than the nightside in this altitude
regime, contrary to what is seen in Mars global circulation models at similar altitudes. It is
unclear why this might be the case; since this seems to be in both the +E and -E hemispheres,
it is unlikely the precipitation is warming the dayside enough to increase the density by an
order of magnitude. Therefore, it may be due to the coordinate transformation changing what
the normal seasonal trends would look like. Unsurprisingly, the diurnal change in density is
highest for this season.

binned and averaged as described in the text. See ﬁgure 2 for a description of the ﬁgure.

While data coverage is slightly diﬀerent in ﬁgure 5 for the fall equinox, the overall den-

sity trends are similar to ﬁgure 3 at the spring equinox. The same high density region near
100◦ and 250◦ longitude for O is somewhat visible, although it is not as concentrated in a
particular latitude region, indicating the variable solar wind conditions changing the MSE
coordinates. CO2 and Ar densities are again as expected by GCM models.

Because the start of the MAVEN mission was in Martian winter and the dataset used in
this paper is slightly over a full Martian year, ﬁgure 6 is the only one of the four that contains
data from more than one Martian year. Figure 6 shows data from northern winter, which is
also the season closest to solar periapse and is typically dusty, which can warm or "puﬀ up"
the atmosphere. This season diﬀers most from that predicted by GCM models, which predict
that for O the nightside should be an order of magnitude higher density than the dayside at
these altitudes, which we do not see here. Instead, both hemispheres are nearly equal in den-
sity. Likewise, Ar and CO2 are lower density on the nightside than would be expected. As
mentioned above, the atmosphere close to periapsis can be quite dusty, which can change at-
mospheric temperatures and densities. GCM models typically use a dust average, usually for
a weakly dusty season [Bougher et al., 2014]. Thus is it likely that the diﬀerence between the
data and model can be accounted for by dust, for while there has not been a global dust storm

in some years, there are generally multiple large dust storms during this season every Martian
year.

In table 1, we have split the MSE density data into dayside positive and negative E ﬁeld

direction (i.e. latitude) and nightside positive and negative E ﬁeld direction, then taken the
mean for each group. This shows that for all three species, regardless of solar zenith angle,
the -E hemisphere is slightly higher in density than the +E hemisphere. Therefore it is pos-
sible that ion precipitation is adding energy to the neutral atmosphere in the -E hemisphere,
hence raising the temperature and expanding the atmosphere. However, the standard devia-
tion for these averages is large, up to 50 percent of the average density value, due to the data
being from an entire hemisphere and thus varying widely in density. As a result, the diﬀer-
ences between the ±E hemispheres are not individually statistically signiﬁcant, but are con-
sistent for all three species, as is the magnitude of the change, suggesting that precipitation
might be aﬀecting the neutrals on a global scale.

4 Discussion

Both diurnal and seasonal local time variations in density near the exobase are easily

visible in the MSE coordinates and show the expected changes. Seasonal variations are more
complex, since they also depend on geographic latitude, not just solar longitude. However,
the data shown in MSE coordinates is consistent with those studies in which the data is ex-
amined in geodetic coordinates. The orbital distance of Mars from the Sun, of course, also
plays a role as it is highly eccentric aﬀecting the solar insolation and, hence, the atmospheric
structure. Comparing ﬁgure 4 and ﬁgure 6 shows densities at solar apoapse are lower than
those near periapse as expected [Bougher et al., 2014, 2015].

By deﬁnition, MSE coordinates provide information about the eﬀect of ion ﬂow in var-

ious regions. Because models have demonstrated that ion precipitation can transfer energy
and increase neutral temperatures [Fang et al., 2013; Michael and Johnson, 2005], which in
turn causes an increased scale height, comparing densities at the same altitude could be a
proxy for the upper atmosphere heating rate. This is reﬂected the seasonal eﬀect and higher
average dayside densities at ﬁxed altitude seen in ﬁgures 1 and 2 for Ar and CO2 [Valleille
et al., 2009; Mahaﬀy et al., 2015; Lillis et al., 2015]. Therefore, the slightly higher densities

seen in the -E hemisphere in table 1 suggests it is on average, slightly warmer than the +E
hemisphere for both day and night.

Consistent with other studies using MAVEN data, atmospheric heating by incident

plasma ions is found to be a small eﬀect during the period examined. Our analysis suggests
that heating of the neutrals on entering (-E hemisphere) slightly dominates heating on exit-
ing (+E hemisphere). Since the change in density from MSE north to south in the altitude
region studied is within one standard deviation of the mean, it is not statistically signiﬁcant.
However, the observed few percent diﬀerence is consistent with recent models of ion pre-
cipitation and sputtering [Fang et al., 2013; Leblanc et al., 2017]. Due to the expected size
of the density change and the lack of coverage on the dayside, it is not obvious in the global
density maps (e.g. ﬁgure 2). To further evaluate its importance will require data at times of
high solar activity, as well as data at lower solar zenith angles, which is not possible without
independent solar wind measurements made simultaneously with the density measurements.
Although there is a suggestion of an eﬀect, the role of pick-up ion precipitation, thought to be
critical in the evolution of the Martian atmosphere, remains elusive.
