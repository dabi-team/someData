ABSTRACT

We present the analysis of physical conditions, chemical composition and kinematic properties of two bow shocks —HH 529 II
and HH 529 III— of the fully photoionized Herbig-Haro object HH 529 in the Orion Nebula. The data were obtained with the
Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the 8.2m Very Large Telescope and 20 years of Hubble Space Telescope imaging.
We separate the emission of the high-velocity components of HH 529 II and III from the nebular one, determining 𝑛e and 𝑇e in
all components through multiple diagnostics, including some based on recombination lines (RLs). We derive ionic abundances
of several ions, based on collisionally excited lines (CELs) and RLs. We ﬁnd a good agreement between the predictions of the
temperature ﬂuctuation paradigm (𝑡2) and the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) in the main emission of the Orion Nebula.
However, 𝑡2 can not account for the higher ADF found in HH 529 II and III. We estimate a 6% of Fe in the gas-phase of the Orion
Nebula, while this value increases to 14% in HH 529 II and between 10% and 25% in HH 529 III. We ﬁnd that such increase is
probably due to the destruction of dust grains in the bow shocks. We ﬁnd an overabundance of C, O, Ne, S, Cl and Ar of about
0.1 dex in HH 529 II-III that might be related to the inclusion of H-deﬁcient material from the source of the HH 529 ﬂow. We
determine the proper motions of HH 529 ﬁnding multiple discrete features. We estimate a ﬂow angle with respect to the sky
plane of 58 ± 4◦ for HH 529.

1 INTRODUCTION

Herbig-Haro (HH) objects are small emission nebulae associated
with outﬂows from young stars interacting with the surrounding en-
vironment (Schwartz 1983). Since their discovery by George Herbig
and Guillermo Haro (Herbig 1950, 1951, 1952; Haro 1952, 1953)
a multitude of them have been discovered and studied. Through the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), multiple velocity features associated
with HH objects have been observed in the Orion Nebula with un-
precedented detail. There are several works dedicated to determine
the nature and physical properties of many outﬂows from stars in the
Orion Nebula (see Bally et al. 2000; Bally & Reipurth 2001; O’Dell
& Henney 2008; O’Dell et al. 2015, and references therein). These
have revealed that the Orion Nebula is a complex environment with
multiple gas interactions. These high velocity systems cover a wide
range of velocities with noticeable diﬀerences in the conditions of
their emitting gas.

Through the radiation ﬁeld of the massive stars of the Orion Neb-
ula, HH objects can be photoionized under conditions where the

shock between the ambient gas and the HH merely serves to cre-
ate a dense blob where we can determine the physical conditions
and chemical abundances using the standard methods developed to
study ionized nebulae (Reipurth & Bally 2001). Moderate velocity
(𝑣 < 100 km s−1) shocks in H II regions are predicted to be strongly
radiative, showing only a thin high-𝑇e cooling zone immediately be-
hind the shock, which contributes little to the total emission (Henney
2002). The bulk of the shocked gas returns to thermal equilibrium
at the same 𝑇e as the ambient gas, hence the combined front (shock
plus cooling zone) can be considered isothermal. However, there are
few works in the literature dedicated to analyse the chemical com-
position of photoionized HH objects, isolating their emission from
that of the nebula in which they are immersed. Using high-spectral
resolution spectroscopy, Blagrave et al. (2006) and Mesa-Delgado
et al. (2009) were able to separate the emission of HH 529 III+II
and HH 202 S, respectively, from the main emission of the Orion
Nebula. This permitted the analysis of the chemical composition of
the ionized gas under the peculiar physical conditions of the HHs
and the eﬀects of their interaction with the surrounding nebular gas,
such as the chemical eﬀects of dust destruction.

As Mesa-Delgado et al. (2008) showed through long slit spectra,

there are important spatial variations in the physical conditions of the
Orion Nebula due to the presence of HH objects. These variations
also aﬀect some chemical properties of the gas. For example, these
authors found an increase in the discrepancy between the abundances
obtained from recombination lines (RLs) and collisionally excited
lines (CELs) for the same heavy element at the locations of HH
objects. Therefore, it is important to investigate the physical and
chemical inﬂuence that HH objects exert on the gas of ionized nebula
and test our knowledge of photoionized regions by analysing objects
with complex conditions.

This work aims to be the ﬁrst in a series devoted to the analysis
of photoionized HHs in the Orion Nebula using very high resolution
spectroscopy from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph
(UVES) (D’Odorico et al. 2000) attached to the UT2 (Kueyen) of
the Very Large Telescope (VLT). This paper is dedicated to two bow
shocks associated with HH 529: HH 529 II and HH 529 III. HH 529
consists of a series of shocks ﬂowing toward the east in the central
region of the Orion Nebula. It is divided into three main shocks des-

ignated as HH 529 I, HH 529 II and HH 529 III, numbered from west
to east (O’Dell & Henney 2008). We spatially separate the emission
from HH 529 II and HH 529 III and isolate the blueshifted high-
velocity emission of the gas of the shock from the nebular one. We
analyse our high-spectral resolution observations that cover a wide
spectral range (3100-10400 Å) through 4 spatial cuts, obtaining 7 1D
spectra: 4 corresponding to the main emission of the Orion Nebula,
one for HH 529 II, another one for HH 529 III and one additional
1D spectrum corresponding to the sum of all the 1D spectra. This
last spectrum simulates a single low-spectral resolution longslit ob-
servation, including the mixing of the HH emission with that of the
nebular gas, summing up the emission of all the velocity components
for each emission line. In this paper we analyse the physical condi-
tions, chemical composition and kinematic properties of HH 529 II
and HH 529 III as well as the Orion Nebula in several small and
nearby areas.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the
observations and the reduction process for the spectroscopic data,

HH 529 in the plane of the sky. In Section 3 we describe the emission
line measurements, identiﬁcations and the reddening correction as
well as a comparison between our observations and those from Bla-
grave et al. (2006) over the common spectral range (3500-7500 Å).
In Section 4 we derive the physical conditions of the gas through-
out diﬀerent methods, using CELs, RLs and continuum emission.
In Section 5 we derive ionic abundances using both RLs and CELs.
In Section 6 we describe the temperature ﬂuctuations paradigm and
estimate values of 𝑡2, based on the diﬀerent temperature diagnostics.
In Section 7 we discuss the abundance discrepancy (AD) between
ionic abundances derived with CELs and RLs. In Section 8 we anal-
yse the total abundances obtained from RLs and CELs, in the second
case both with and without the assumption of the existence of tem-
perature ﬂuctuations (𝑡2 > 0 and 𝑡2 = 0, respectively). We also
discuss the increase in the gaseous Fe abundance due to dust de-
struction in HH 529 II and HH 529 III. In Section 9 we describe the
radial velocity structure of each component, both the nebular and the
high-velocity ones. We also derive the electron temperature from the
thermal broadening of the line proﬁles. In Sections 10 and 11 we
calculate the proper motions of HH 529 and discuss some physical
properties of the shock, such as the pre-shock density. Finally, in
Section 12 we summarize our main conclusions. In the appendix,
some extra information, tables and ﬁgures are attached as supporting
material.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The observations were made under photometric conditions during
the night of November 28 and 29, 2013 using UVES in the UT2
of the Very large Telescope (VLT) in Cerro Paranal, Chile. The slit
position was centred at the coordinates RA(J2000)=05ℎ35𝑚16𝑠.80,
DEC(J2000)=−05◦23(cid:48)57.48(cid:48)(cid:48), with a slit length of 10 arcsec in the
blue arm and 12 arcsec in the red arm in order to give an adequate
interorder separation. Table 1 shows the main parameters of UVES
observations. The slit width was set to 1 arcsec, which provides an
eﬀective spectral resolution 𝜆/Δ𝜆 ≈ 40000 (6.5 km s−1). To perform
the ﬂux calibration of the data, three exposures of 150s of the standard
star GD71 (Moehler et al. 2014a,b) were taken under similar condi-
tions of seeing and airmass than the science observations during the
same night. The spatial coverage of the slit is shown in Fig. 1.

Our observations cover the spectral range between 3100-10420 Å,
using two standard dichroic settings of UVES. Dichroic #1 setting
split the light in two wavelengths ranges: from 3100 to 3885 Å
in the blue arm and from 4785 to 6805 Å in the red one, while
the dichroic #2 setting covers from 3750 to 4995 Å in the blue
arm and from 6700 to 10420 Å in the red one. However, in our
high resolution and wide spectral range observations, there are some
observational gaps. The red arm use two CCDs, and due to their
physical separation, spectral ranges 5773–5833 Å and 8540–8650
Å could not be observed. Additionally there are some narrow gaps
that could not be observed in the redmost part of the red arm in the
dichroic #2 setting because the spectral orders could not ﬁt entirely
within the CCD. These ranges are ∼ 8911–8913 Å, 9042–9046 Å,
9178–9182 Å, 9317–9323 Å, 9460–9469 Å, 9608–9619 Å, 9760–
9774 Å, 9918–9935 Å, 10080–10100 Å and 10248–10271 Å.

We reduced the spectra using a combination of tasks from the pub-
lic ESO UVES pipeline (Ballester et al. 2000) under the gasgano
graphic user interface, and tasks built by ourselves based on IRAF1

(Tody 1993) and several python packages. Firstly, we used IRAF taks
FIXPIX and IMCOMBINE to mask known bad pixels in our images
and to combine all the images with the same exposure time. Then, we
used the ESO UVES pipeline for bias subtraction, background sub-
traction, aperture extraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding and wavelength calibration.
As a product, we obtained a 2D science spectrum for each arm in
each dichroic setting without ﬂux calibration. We followed the same
procedure for GD 71 but extracting both a 2D and a 1D spectrum.
The 2D spectrum of the calibration star helps us to note the presence
of faint sky lines which are also present in the science spectra.

One crucial step of the data reduction is to perform adequate cuts
in the spatial direction of the slit to extract 1D spectra. We chose
these spatial cuts in order to study in detail each observed velocity
component and trying to maximise the shock/nebular emission ratio.
We relied on the [Fe III] 𝜆4658 line, which is relatively bright in the
high-velocity components, to delimit the cuts. In the bi-dimensional
spectrum shown in Fig. 2 for some representative lines, we show that
the seeing conditions permit us to spatially separate HH 529 II from
HH 529 III. HH 529 II has a “ball shape” while HH 529 III presents
an elongated distribution along the spectral axis. This is related to
the morphology of the outﬂow system of HH 529 (ﬁrstly identiﬁed
by Bally et al. 2000). This system shows three prominent bright
arcs, identiﬁed by the numbers I, II and III, being numbered by their
position from west to east (O’Dell & Henney 2008). However, the
system is more complex than just three homogeneous arcs as we will
analyse in Section 10. The length covered by each cut in the spatial
direction is 1.23 arcsec, 4.43 arcsec, 2.46 arcsec and 1.23 arcsec for
cuts 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The numbering of the cuts has been
deﬁned from west to east. The high-velocity component of cut 3
corresponds to HH 529 III, while that of cut 2 is HH 529 II. We have
also deﬁned an additional 1D spectrum, labelled as “combined cuts”.
This was created by adding the ﬂux of the lines in all the velocity
components when they were detected at least in the nebular emission
of all cuts. The spectrum of the combined cuts is useful for analysing
the eﬀect that a non-resolved shock component would have in the
properties of a low-resolution spectrum. We used the Python-based
Astropy package (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013; Price-Whelan
et al. 2018) to obtain 1D spectra for each cut, doing the conversion
between the diﬀerent pixel scale of the CCDs in the blue and the
red arm. Each spatial cut covers an area larger than the seeing size
during the observations, as is shown in Table 1. We used the IRAF
tasks STANDARD, SENSFUNC and CALIBRATE to perform the

For the determination of the proper motion of HH 529, we take
advantage of the 20 years of archival 𝐻𝑆𝑇 imaging that is now
available. We employ three epochs of observations, as detailed in
Table 2. All data were downloaded from the Barbara A. Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescopes2.

3 LINE INTENSITIES AND REDDENING

We used the SPLOT task from IRAF to measure line intensities and
estimate their uncertainties. We applied a double Gaussian proﬁle
ﬁt for the nebular and the high-velocity component, delimiting the
continuum by eye. The error estimations are carried out by SPLOT
by Monte-Carlo simulations around a gaussian sigma deﬁned as the
average rms measured on the continuum on both sides of each line
with 100 iterations. The error estimates are one sigma estimates. We
also consider an error of the absolute ﬂux calibration of 2%, added
quadratically. In case of evident line blending, we applied as many
Gaussians as necessary to properly reproduce the line proﬁle. As
was mentioned in Section 2, the observed wavelength range (3100–
10420 Å) was covered in 4 sections (two dichroic settings splitting
the light into two spectrograph arms). Between each section, there
is an overlapping zone from where we used the most intense lines
to normalize the entire spectrum with respect to H𝛽. The measured

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

ﬂux of H i 𝜆3835, [O iii] 𝜆4959 and [S ii] 𝜆6731 lines were used to
normalize the spectra from the blue arm of dichroic #1, the red arm
of dichroic #1 and the red arm of dichroic #2 settings respectively
(H𝛽 is in the blue arm of dichroic #2 setting). This normalization
eliminates the diﬀerences in ﬂux between each part of the spectrum
due to the diﬀerent pixel scale between the blue and the red arms.

The emission lines were corrected for reddening using Eq. (1),
where 𝑓 (𝜆) is the adopted extinction curve from Blagrave et al.
(2007), normalized to H𝛽. We calculate the reddening coeﬃcient,
c(H𝛽), by using the ratios of H𝜀, H𝛿, H𝛾 and H𝛼 Balmer lines and
the P12, P11, P10, P9 Paschen lines with respect to H𝛽 and the
emissivity coeﬃcients of Storey & Hummer (1995).

The ﬁnal adopted c(H𝛽) value is the weighted average value obtained
from the aforementioned Balmer and Paschen lines and is shown in
Table 3 for each component. The selected H I lines are free of line-
blending or telluric absorptions that may aﬀect the determination of
c(H𝛽). Despite the existence of further isolated and bright Balmer
and Paschen lines in the spectra, we did not use them since their
emission depart from the case B values. This behaviour was reported
previously in the Orion Nebula (Mesa-Delgado et al. 2009), the
Magellanic Clouds (Domínguez-Guzmán et al. 2019) and in several
planetary nebulae (PNe, see Rodríguez 2020).

Blagrave et al. (2006) (hereinafter BMB06) observed a zone of
the Orion Nebula that includes HH 529 II+III using the 4m Blanco
telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, covering

the 3500-7500Å spectral region. Fig. 3 shows a comparison be-
tween their reddening corrected nebular spectrum and ours (from
cut 2). For the comparison, we have excluded lines ﬂagged with
notes of “Avg”, “blend” or “small FWHM” in Table 1 of BMB06,
due to their uncertain ﬂuxes. For example, [Ne III] 𝜆3967.46 line,
marked with an “Avg”, is inconsistent with the measured intensity of
[Ne III]𝜆3868.75, since their observed ratio is 2.02, quite far from
the theoretical one of 3.29 (McLaughlin et al. 2011). A least squares
linear ﬁt of the data represented in Fig. 3 yields the relationship
𝑦 = 1.00 (±0.01) x+0.05 (±0.02), indicating that the BMB06’s spec-
trum (𝑦 values) presents systematically larger (by a factor of ∼ 1.12)
line ratios (relative to H𝛽) than ours (𝑥 values). This is very noticeable
in the spectral region of the high-level Balmer lines (3660-3720Å),
where this diﬀerence can reach up to 50%. This may be due to the
relative weakness of these lines, coupled with the abrupt change in
the continuum level due to the closeness to the Balmer discontinuity.
In Table D1, we compare our values of some selected reddening-
corrected Balmer line ratios with those obtained by BMB06. The
Balmer line ratios with respect to H𝛽 obtained by BMB06 for both
components diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the theoretical values. However,
this does not seem to be the case when we use ratios of Balmer lines
excluding H𝛽. An underestimation of around 10% in the ﬂux of H𝛽
in the BMB06’s spectrum explains the systematic trend observed in
Fig. 3. We do not compare the high-velocity component of BMB06
with our data of HH 529 II and HH 529 III since their slit position
and spatial coverage is slightly diﬀerent than ours.

Fig. 4 shows the [O III] 𝜆4958.91 line proﬁle in the diﬀerent cuts.
As can be seen, the reddest component of each proﬁle (corresponding
to the nebular component) shows practically the same shape in all
cuts except in cut 3, where the line is broadened by the presence
of a larger velocity dispersion in the high-velocity component. The
complexity of the velocity components of HH 529 is discussed in
more detail in Section 10.

Line identiﬁcations were consistently made by adopting the the-
oretical wavelengths of Peter Van Hoof’s latest Atomic Line List
v2.05b21 3 (Van Hoof 2018) for all ions except for Cl III, Cl IV and
Ne III due to some inconsistencies found (see Section 9 for a detailed
discussion). The number of lines we have identiﬁed in our spectra
is very large. Line identiﬁcations and observed and dereddened ﬂux
line ratios are presented in 4 online tables, one for each analysed cut.
Tables of cut 2 and cut 3 contain, in addition to the observed nebular
component, the spectra of HH 529 II and HH 529 III, respectively.
These tables contain, for each measured line, the identiﬁed rest-frame
wavelength (𝜆0), the identiﬁed ion, the observed wavelength (𝜆), the
radial velocity with respect to 𝜆0 (𝑣𝑟 ), the full width at half maximum
(FWHM), the observed ﬂux relative to F(H𝛽)=100 (F(𝜆)/F(H𝛽)), the
reddening corrected intensity relative to I(H𝛽)=100 (I(𝜆)/I(H𝛽)), the
estimated error of the reddening corrected intensity and some notes.
In the nebular components, 514, 633, 579 and 522 lines were mea-
sured in cuts 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. For HH 529 II and HH 529 III,

4 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS

The estimation of the physical conditions and chemical abundances
in the diﬀerent components analyzed in this work are based on their
photoionization equilibrium state. However, since HH 529 II and
HH 529 III are produced by the interaction of high-velocity ﬂows
within the photoionized gas of the Orion Nebula, some contribu-
tion of the shock in the energy balance of the ionized gas may be
expected. In Sec. 11, we demonstrate that the shock contribution in
the observed optical spectra of the high-velocity components is very
small and, therefore, the physical conditions and ionic abundances
of these objects can be determined by means of the usual tools for
analyzing ionized nebulae.

4.1 Physical conditions based on CELs

We use PyNeb (version 1.1.10) (Luridiana et al. 2015) and the up-
dated atomic dataset listed in Table D3 to calculate physical condi-
tions based on the intensity ratios of CELs from diﬀerent ions.

The ﬁrst step was to test all the intensity ratios of CELs that can
serve as a temperature or density diagnostic using the PyNeb task
getCrossTemDen. This task uses two line ratios at the same time: one
as density diagnostic and the other one for temperature, giving their
convergence to a pair 𝑛e, 𝑇e as a result. We tried all possible permuta-
tions for all the available diagnostics in all components from all cuts.
We only discarded the use of lines strongly aﬀected by blends, tel-
luric emissions and/or absorptions or reﬂections in the optical system
of the spectrograph. We did not consider the 𝑛e diagnostic based on
[N I] 𝜆𝜆5198/5200 owing to a signiﬁcant ﬂuorescent contribution
in the Orion Nebula (Ferland et al. 2012).

Diagnostics based on [Ni III] 𝜆1/𝜆2, where 𝜆1, 𝜆2
∈
[6000, 6534, 6682, 6797, 6946, 7890] do not give any useful phys-
information since they either did not converge or showed
ical
convergences at values highly discordant with the other diag-
nostics. This will be discussed in Section C. Another inter-
esting diagnostics are based on [Fe III] 𝜆1/𝜆2, where 𝜆1, 𝜆2 ∈
[4658, 4702, 4734, 4881, 5011, 4925, 4987, 5271]. With the excep-
tion of [Fe III] 4658/4702, all the diagnostics converge in a fairly
wide range of physical conditions. This is due to the ambivalence
and/or high dependence of these ratios on both density and temper-
ature. This will be discussed in Section 4.2.

After the initial exploration, we deﬁne the ratios we consider good
indicators of electron density and temperature. Then we use Monte
Carlo simulations with 1000 points to estimate uncertainties in the
physical conditions given by the getCrossTemDen task of PyNeb.
For example, using [O III]𝜆4363/𝜆𝜆4959+5007 as a temperature in-
dicator and the following density diagnostics: [Cl III]𝜆5538/𝜆5518,

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

[Fe III]𝜆4658/𝜆4702, [O II]𝜆3726/𝜆3729, [S II]𝜆6731/𝜆6716 and
[Ar IV]𝜆4740/𝜆4711, we estimate the convergence in 𝑇e and 𝑛e and
their uncertainties in every case. Analogously, we use the rest of 𝑇e-
diagnostics. The central value of 𝑇e or 𝑛e corresponds to the median
of the Monte Carlo distribution and the errors are represented by the
deviations to 84th and 16th percentiles, corresponding to ±1𝜎 in the
case of a Gaussian. After this procedure, all diagnostics (either 𝑇e or
𝑛e), will have a result for each cross-comparison.

For the nebular components on each cut, we deﬁne the representa-
tive 𝑛e as the weighted mean4 in each cross-comparison with all the
the temperature indicators. In the case of high-velocity components,
the treatment is more complex since all the density diagnostics based
on CELs reveal considerably higher densities than in the nebular
components, reaching values at or above the critical densities of the
atomic levels involved in some diagnostics as shown in Table D5. At
densities of 104 − 106 cm−3, diagnostics based on [Fe III] lines are
more reliable than other classic ones such as [O II] 𝜆3726/𝜆3729 or
[S II] 𝜆6731/𝜆6716. In addition, dust destruction processes release
gaseous Fe in the shock front that should favor the larger contri-
bution of the emission of [Fe III] lines of the post-shock gas and,
therefore, the derived physical conditions would be biased to those of
the post-shock zones. We adopted a maximum-likelihood method to
determine the density from [Fe III] lines for the high-velocity com-
ponents. This procedure and its interpretation is described in detail
in Section 4.2.

Finally, using the adopted representative 𝑛e, we calculate 𝑇e with
the available diagnostics using the getTemDen task of PyNeb. As-
suming the scheme of two ionization zones, we deﬁne 𝑻e(high) as
the weighted mean 𝑇e obtained from [Ar III]𝜆5192/𝜆𝜆7136+7751,

4 The weights were deﬁned as the inverse of the square of the error associated
to each density diagnostic.

[O III]𝜆4363/𝜆𝜆4959+5007 and [S III]𝜆6312/𝜆𝜆9069+9531 line ra-
tios. Similarly, we deﬁne 𝑻e(low) based on the resulting 𝑇e ob-
tained from [S II]𝜆𝜆4069+76/𝜆𝜆 6716+31, [N II]𝜆5755/𝜆6584 and
[O II]𝜆𝜆3726+29/𝜆𝜆7319+20+30+31 line ratios.

We note that in the nebular component of all cuts the observed
[S III] 𝜆9531/𝜆9069 line intensity ratio does not agree with the the-
oretical value. This is owing to strong telluric absorptions that af-
fect the [S III] 𝜆9069 line that, on the other hand, do not aﬀect the
blueshifted lines of the high velocity components. After an inspec-
tion in the 2D spectra of the calibration star and in the science object,
we concluded that [S III] 𝜆9531 is not aﬀected by telluric absorp-
tions or emissions at the earth velocities at which the observations
were taken. In the nebular component of all cuts, we assumed the
theoretical ratio 𝐼([S III] 9531)/𝐼([S III] 9069) = 2.47 obtained from
the atomic data given in Table D3 to estimate 𝑇e([S III]).

Plasma diagnostic plots shown in Fig. D1, indicate that the re-
sulting values of each diagnostic are consistent with each other. The
numerical values in each case are presented in Table 4.

4.2 Physical conditions based on [Fe III] lines.

As mentioned in Section 4.1, density diagnostics based on diﬀerent
[Fe III] line intensity ratios give apparently discordant results. This
is mainly due to the ambivalence in the density dependence of some
observed intensity ratios and/or due to their high dependence on
𝑇e as well as on 𝑛e. These two scenarios are exempliﬁed in Fig. 5
for [Fe III] 𝜆4881/𝜆4658 and 𝜆5271/𝜆4658 line ratios, upper and
middle panels, respectively. 𝜆4881/𝜆4658 has a broad maximum
around 𝑛e ∼ 2 × 104 cm−3, so only becomes an accurate density
diagnostic for 𝑛e < 5 × 103 cm−3 or 𝑛e > 105 cm−3. In the case
of 𝜆5271/𝜆4658, the 𝑇e dependence is always important except for
some narrow density ranges between ∼102 cm−3 and ∼103 cm −3
and between ∼105 cm−3 and ∼106 cm −3. For the expected densities
in the diﬀerent components observed in this work (𝑛e between ∼103
cm−3 and ∼105 cm −3), these diagnostics are not very enlightening
on their own. On the other hand, for 103 cm−3 < 𝑛e < 106 cm−3,
𝜆4658/𝜆4702 (see bottom panel of Fig. 5) varies monotonically with
𝑛e and is insensitive to 𝑇e. Thus, it is the most reliable diagnostic in
our case.

We consider that the option to determine the physical conditions
based on the observed intensity ratios of [Fe III] lines is using a
maximum-likelihood process. This method is based on a 𝜒2 mini-
mization by testing a wide range of parameters. The value of 𝜒2 is
deﬁned in Eq. (2), as the sum of the quadratic diﬀerences between
the abundance of ion X𝑖 (in this case Fe2+) determined with each
emission line included in the procedure and the weighted average of
the abundance deﬁned in Eq. (3).

This self-consistent procedure gives the physical parameters that

on the variables that aﬀect the line ﬂuxes, otherwise a spurious
contribution appears, and can change the resulting parameters that
minimize 𝜒2. For example, undetected blends in the studied lines
can result in incorrect density and/or temperature determinations.

We have considered several aspects to choose the set of [Fe III]
lines that should be included in the maximum-likelihood process. We
discard lines with evident line blending or contamination by telluric
emission or ghosts. To test unnoticed line blends or inaccuracies in

ﬂux estimations, we use ratios of observed lines that should depend
only on transition probabilities and not on physical conditions. The
results are shown in Table D6. As can be seen, there are some devia-
tions between the theoretical and the observed values in the cases of
[Fe III] 𝜆4667/𝜆4734, 𝜆4778/𝜆4667, 𝜆4607/𝜆4702, 𝜆4607/𝜆4770
and 𝜆4881/𝜆4987 due to the contamination of [Fe III] 𝜆4667 by a
ghost, by the blend of [Fe III] 𝜆4607 with N II 𝜆4607.15 and by the
blend of [Fe III] 𝜆4987.29 with N II 𝜆4987.38. On the other hand, we
detect that 𝜆4778 line is 35% wider than the rest of the [Fe III] bright
lines in HH 529 II, although, this is not observed in HH 529 III. This
suggests that, due to the higher signal to noise ratio in the cut 2 spec-
trum, a line blend with an emission feature is detected in HH 529 II
while for HH 529 III it remains below the detection level. The line
ratio with the largest deviation is [Fe III] 𝜆5011/𝜆4085. This could
be mainly due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the [Fe III] 𝜆4085
line. However, [Fe III] 𝜆5011 is located close to [O III] 𝜆5007, which
presents broad wings in its line proﬁle that aﬀects the shape of the
continuum close to [Fe III] 𝜆5011 and perhaps the measurement of its
line ﬂux. The presence of bright lines aﬀecting the continuum shape
in areas close to relatively weak [Fe III] lines may also contribute
to some diﬀerences between the observed and predicted line ratios
shown in Table D6. This problem is reduced by using the brightest
line of each ratio in the maximum-likelihood process.

We select the following [Fe III] lines for the maximum-likelihood
process: 𝜆𝜆4658.17, 4701.64, 4734.00, 4881.07 and 5270.57. This
selection includes the brightest [Fe III] lines that are free of blends
or telluric emissions and/or absorptions. Moreover, these lines lie
in a relatively small spectral range and hence, uncertainties in the
reddening correction would have a negligible eﬀect. This allows us
to restrict the parameter space to electron density and temperature
to test 𝜒2. Studies of the primordial helium abundance have used
similar maximum-likelihood procedures to calculate the He+ abun-
dance and have found that this procedure can lead to degeneracies
in the ﬁtted parameters and 𝜒2 (see Olive & Skillman 2004; Aver
et al. 2011, and references therein). Because of this, it is important
to have an overview of the behavior of 𝜒2 in the complete parameter
space. In Fig. 6 we present the convergence of 𝜒2 in the 𝑛e − 𝑇e
space for both high-velocity and nebular components of cut 2. As
it can be seen, 𝜒2 falls into a single minimum in each case, corre-
sponding to 𝑇e = 8500 ± 1050 K and 𝑛e = 11880 ± 1860 cm−3 for
HH 529 II and 𝑇e = 8450 ± 730 K and 𝑛e = 9430 ± 1010 cm−3 for
the nebular component. The 𝑇e and 𝑛e values obtained for the rest of
cuts using this approach are presented in Table 4. The convergence
to the resulting 𝑛e is consistent with the diagnostic based on [Fe III]
𝜆4658/𝜆4702 ratio but with a smaller uncertainty due to the applica-
tion of the 𝜒2 maximum-likelihood procedure. It is notable that in all
cases, [Fe III] lines give 𝑛e values higher than the usual diagnostics
based on CELs such as [S II] 𝜆6731/𝜆6716 or [O II] 𝜆3726/𝜆3729.
The largest diﬀerence is found in the high-velocity components, in
particular in HH 529 III. In the case of nebular components, the
low dependence on density of some ratios such as 𝜆4734/𝜆4658,
𝜆4658/𝜆4702 or 𝜆4734/𝜆4702 at density values smaller than ∼ 103
cm−3, gives more weight to the higher-density zones within the line
of sight. On the other hand, in the high-velocity components, the
larger diﬀerences suggest the presence of high densities in the range
of 104 −105 cm−3, where the usual density diagnostics, such as [S II]
𝜆6731/𝜆6716 or [O II] 𝜆3726/𝜆3729, are uncertain, being well above
the critical densities, as is shown in Table D5. In addition, as found
in HH 202 (Mesa-Delgado et al. 2009; Espíritu et al. 2017) and in
this work (see Section 8.1.3), the gaseous Fe abundance is higher in
the high-velocity components due to the dust destruction where the
Fe is commonly depleted, thus, the ﬂux of [Fe III] lines increase in

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

the shock front, where the gas is being compressed. Therefore, the
𝑛e determinations based on [Fe III] lines will be biased to the higher
values of the density at the head of the shock although the volume of
gas integrated in the high-velocity components include not only the
denser gas of the head but also some contribution of the jet beam gas
behind since it is fully photoionized and ﬂowing towards the observer
(see Section 11).

The results indicate a closer similarity between 𝑇e([Fe III]) and
𝑇e(high), contrary to what the ionization potential of Fe2+ would
suggest, closer to N+ than to O2+, which are ions representative of the
low and high ionization zones, respectively. In the case of the nebular
components, the fact that the [Fe III] density diagnostics give more
weight to the high-density zones in the line of sight, as we mentioned
previously, may bias the results towards lower temperatures, which
are not representative for all the Fe2+. On the other hand, in the high-
velocity components, this indicates that in the shock front, where
further dust destruction and incorporation of Fe into the gas phase
is expected, the high-ionization gas dominates over the remaining
low-ionization one, which may be ﬂowing behind of the shock front.
This suggests that the optimal temperature to calculate the Fe2+
abundance in the high-velocity components is 𝑇e(high). Estimates
of Fe2+ abundances based on both 𝑇e(low) and 𝑇e(high) will be
discussed separately in Section 8.1.3.

4.3 Physical conditions based on RLs.

4.3.1 Physical conditions based on O II RLs

To estimate physical conditions based on O II RLs, we use the eﬀec-
tive recombination coeﬃcients from Storey et al. (2017). These coef-
ﬁcients fully account the dependence on electron density and temper-
ature of the population distribution among the ground levels of O II.
We follow a similar maximum-likelihood procedure as described in
Section 4.2 to derive the physical conditions. For this case, we chose
the observed lines from multiplet 1 and 𝜆𝜆4089.29, 4275.55 from 3d-
4f transitions, due to the following reasons: (1) lines from multiplet 1
are the brightest O II RLs and are comparatively less aﬀected by line
blending or instrumental reﬂections as is illustrated in Fig. 7 for cut 2.
(2) The line ratios within multiplet 1 deviate from the local thermo-
dynamic equilibrium (LTE) values for 𝑛e ≤ 105 cm−3 (Storey et al.
2017), providing a density diagnostic. (3) O II 𝜆𝜆4089.29, 4275.55
RLs corresponding to 3d-4f transitions depend slightly stronger on
𝑇e than the lines from multiplet 1 and their ratio with O II 𝜆4649.13
is practically insensitive to 𝑛e, since the population of the levels
that arise these lines depend on the population of the same 3𝑃2
ground level (Storey et al. 2017), giving a 𝑇e diagnostic. Neverthe-
less, 𝜆𝜆4089.29, 4275.55 are relatively weak and we expect com-
paratively larger uncertainties in the 𝑇e determinations than using
diagnostics based on CELs.

Fig. 8 shows 𝜒2-maps in the space of 𝑇e and 𝑛e for both com-
ponents of cut 2. As it can be seen, HH 529 II has a temperature
degeneracy. This is not surprising, due to the fact that multiplet
1 is rather independent of 𝑇e and the weak line 𝜆4275.55 is the
only one that can break the degeneracy in this component since O II
𝜆4089.29 is blended with a ghost feature (see Section A). However,
it is clear that the density dependence is well limited within a range
of 3000-3700 cm−3. Fixing the temperature to the adopted one for
the high ionization zone using CELs, we obtain 𝑛e = 3490 ± 340
cm−3 for HH 529 II. On the other hand, since we were able to use
the O II 𝜆4089.29 together with 𝜆4275.55 in the nebular component
of cut 2, we have a convergence within a more limited interval of
values. The physical conditions that minimizes 𝜒2 in this case are

their use minimizes observational errors. Second, they are produced
in transitions between singlet levels, ensuring that they are free of
signiﬁcant self-absorption eﬀects. We have explored the temperature
dependence of other intensity ratios of He I 𝜆7281 with respect to
other relevant singlet lines (𝜆𝜆4388, 4922, 4438, 3614, 3965 and
5016) using the recombination coeﬃcients of Porter et al. (2012,
2013). Intensity ratios of transitions coming from 51D, 41D, 31D
levels to 21P show the the strongest dependence on 𝑇e (see Fig. D4).
21P is the same lower level of the transition producing the He I
𝜆7281 line, which comes from the 31S level. On the other hand,
comparatively, the 𝐼(He I 𝜆7281)/𝐼(He I 𝜆6678) ratio has the weak-
est 𝑛e dependence, in agreement with the conclusion of Zhang et al.
(2005), despite using diﬀerent recombination coeﬃcients.

Fig. D5 shows that the 𝑇e dependence of 𝐼(He I 𝜆7281)/𝐼(He I
𝜆6678) ratio is practically linear in the interval 5000 K ≤ 𝑇e(K) ≤
10000 K. The deviation between the determination of 𝑇e(He I) using
a linear ﬁt (as in Eq. (4)) and a more complex interpolation of the
recombination coeﬃcients of Porter et al. (2012, 2013) is always
smaller than 35 K. At 𝑇e > 10000 K, any linear ﬁt will fail for almost
all 𝑛e values except for the lowest ones (𝑛e ≤ 100 cm−3). In these
cases, a more complex treatment is necessary to estimate 𝑇e(He I).
The linear ﬁt (slope and intercept) varies signiﬁcantly in the lower
density ranges, and tends to remain almost constant for densities 𝑛e ≥
10000 cm−3.

In Table D7, we present the slope and intercept values given by
Eq. (4) for a density range representative for H II regions and some
PNe. The resulting 𝑇e(He I), using the average values obtained with
𝐼 (𝜆7281)/𝐼 (𝜆6678), 𝐼 (𝜆7281)/𝐼 (𝜆4922) and 𝐼 (𝜆7281)/𝐼 (𝜆4388)
ratios, are all consistent with each other and are included in Table 4
for all components.

4.4 Electron temperature determinations from nebular

continuum.

Thanks to the high signal-to-noise ratio of our spectra, we can obtain
a good determination of the Balmer and Paschen discontinuities of
the nebular continuum in the spectrum obtained adding all the cuts
(see Fig. 9). We used Eq. (5), taken from Liu et al. (2001) for He2+/H+
= 0 to estimate 𝑇e(H I)Balmer. This formula is based on theoretical

Figure 7. Section of the spectrum of the spatial cut 2 covering the spectral
range 4620-4680Å. Several couples of O II lines from multiplet 1 are present,
showing the quality of the spectra of HH 529 II and the nebular component.
Emissions marked with a G are ghosts (see Section A).

𝑛e = 4390 ± 400 cm−3 and 𝑇e = 9350 ± 1090 K. This result is com-
patible with 𝑇e([O III]) within the uncertainties, indicating that the
emission of CELs and RLs of O2+ comes basically from the same
gas (see Section 8.3).

In Table 4, we can see that the density values obtained from O II
lines are similar to those obtained from other diagnostics in the
nebular components but lower in the high-velocity ones. This may be
because, although formally the population of the 3𝑃𝐽 levels from O2+
do not reach the statistical equilibrium until densities of ∼ 105 cm−3,
the density dependence becomes rather weak from values above ∼
104 cm−3, as it is shown in Fig. 4 from Storey et al. (2017). Therefore,
the values obtained by this diagnostic may not be representative of
the shock front, where the density is expected to be higher than
104 cm−3 but from a lower density component ﬂowing in the jet
beam. A gas component with a density around ∼ 103 cm−3 has
larger deviations from LTE in the populations of the levels from
which multiplet 1 arise. This might bias the results to lower values.
However, this discrepancy may have a diﬀerent origin, which requires
further investigation.

4.3.2 Electron temperature from He I recombination line ratios

Following the procedure used by Zhang et al. (2005) for PNe, we have
used the 𝐼(He I 𝜆7281)/𝐼(He I 𝜆6678) ratio for deriving 𝑇e (He I) in
our spectra. The use of those particular lines have several advan-
tages. First, 𝜆7281 and 𝜆6678 are among the brightest He I RLs and

Figure 8. The same as in Fig. 6 but using O II lines. In this case, there is an evident 𝑇e degeneracy in HH 529 II (left panel) because that the temperature-dependent
O II RL 𝜆4089.29 cannot be measured in its spectrum. A clear convergence can be seen in the nebular component (right panel). The uncertainties are somewhat
large owing to the relative weakness of the temperature-dependent O II lines (𝜆𝜆4089.23, 4275.55).

taken from Fang & Liu (2011) to estimate 𝑇e(H I)Paschen using the
measured Paschen discontinuty and the intensity of H I 𝜆8862.78

The estimation of the temperature requires a precise ﬁt to the con-
tinuum emission at both sides of 3646 Å and 8204 Å, the approximate
wavelengths of the Balmer and Paschen discontinuities, respectively,
since both estimations are very sensitive to changes in the jump
value. We do not determine 𝑇e(H I)Balmer and 𝑇e(H I)Paschen in the
remaining cuts because of the much larger noise level of the contin-
uum in their spectra. However, using the spectrum of the combined
cuts has the drawback of mixing the emission of the nebular and the
high-velocity components in the continuum. In any case, as Bohigas
(2015) suggests, the total 𝑇e(H I) would be the weighted average of
the individual values of the mixed components, where the weight
would be the H+ mass of each component. Thus, given that the high-
velocity component should contain a much smaller mass, we can
assume that the contribution of the high-velocity component to the
continuum should be small, not aﬀecting the 𝑇e(H I) determination
in a substantial manner.

Fig. 9 shows the discontinuities and the ﬁtted Balmer and Paschen
continua in the normalized and reddening corrected spectrum. The
best ﬁt is achieved with BJ/I𝐻 𝛽 = 0.532 ± 0.036 and PJ/I𝐻 𝛽 =
0.031 ± 0.002.

5 CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES

5.1 Ionic abundances from CELs

We determine the ionic abundances based on the observed CELs us-
ing the PyNeb routines and the transition probabilities and collision
strengths given in Table D3. Abundances for O+, N+, S+, Ni2+ and

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

Cl+ were derived using the 𝑛e and 𝑇e(low) adopted for each com-
ponent of each cut, while abundances for O2+, Ne2+, Cl3+, Fe3+,
Ar2+ and Ar3+ rely on the adopted 𝑇e(high). S2+ and Cl2+ abun-
dances were derived using 𝑇e([S III]) (see Section B). In the case of
Fe2+, estimations of its abundance are presented using both 𝑇e(high)
and 𝑇e(low) (see Table D8 and Table D9). This will be analysed in
Section 8.1.3. General results are presented in Table 5.

5.2 Ionic abundances from RLs

5.2.1 He+ abundance

To estimate the He+ abundance, we use the ﬂux of some of the most
intense He I lines: 𝜆𝜆3188, 3614, 3889, 3965, 4026, 4388, 4438,
4471, 4713, 4922, 5016, 5876, 6678, 7065, 7281. He I 𝜆𝜆4121, 5048
lines were discarded because they are contaminated by ghost lines
(see Section A). The 15 selected lines correspond to both singlet and
triplet conﬁgurations, as it is shown in Fig. D4. The ﬂuxes of triplet
lines are aﬀected by the metastability of the 23S level. The compara-
tively much longer lifetime of 23S means that transitions to this level
can become optically thick, altering the ﬂux ratios predicted by re-
combination theory for some He I lines. For example, self-absorption
of He I 𝜆3188 photons can increase the ﬂux of He I 𝜆𝜆3889, 5876
and 7065 lines at the expense of He I 𝜆3188, which ﬂux decreases
accordingly. On the other hand, self-absorption of the He I 𝜆3889 line
is also important and increase the ﬂux of He I 𝜆7065 at the expense
of He I 𝜆3889. However, the sum of the ﬂuxes of He I 𝜆𝜆3188, 3889,
4713, 5876, and 7065 lines should remain independent of the optical
depth (parameterized by 𝜏3889 or 𝜏3188, Porter et al. 2007).

In Table D13, we show the He+ abundances determined using
the ﬂuxes of He I 𝜆𝜆3188, 3889, 4713, 5876, and 7065 lines and
the values of 𝑛e and 𝑇e(He I) corresponding to each component of
each cut. In the same table, we also include the He+ abundance
obtained from the sum of the ﬂuxes of all the individual lines of
the table and re-distributing them assuming 𝜏3188 = 𝜏3889 = 0. In
Table D14 we show the He+ abundances determined from singlet
lines and those triplet ones that are expected to be less aﬀected
by self-absorption (see Table 2 from Benjamin et al. 2002). Tables
D13 and D14 show a good agreement between the average values
of He+/H+ ratios included in Table D14 (the last row) and those
obtained summing the ﬂuxes of the lines included in Table D13.
This last table also shows that the self-absorption eﬀects are less
important in the high-velocity components than in the nebular one.

This is noticeable in the lower dispersion of the abundances obtained
with individual lines in the high-velocity components. As discussed
in Osterbrock & Ferland (2006, see their ﬁgure 4.5) if the nebula
has ionized zones at diﬀerent velocities, the self-absorption eﬀects
can be reduced due to the Doppler shift between the emitting and
absorbing zones. For example, the eﬀect of self-absorption in the
intense He I 𝜆5876 line is notable in the nebular component, giving
He+ abundances about 0.05 dex higher than the sum value. In this
sense, the common procedure of using a ﬂux-weighted average of
He I 𝜆5876 and other bright optical He I lines (as 𝜆4471 and 𝜆6678)
for obtaining the mean He+ abundance would provide rather an upper
limit of it.

Another interesting fact that can be noted in Table D14 is that
the He+ abundance determined from the He I 𝜆5016 line is lower
than the values obtained from other lines in the high-velocity com-
ponents. An abnormally low ﬂux of this line was noted by Esteban
et al. (2004), and this was attributed to self-absorption eﬀects in
the singlet conﬁguration of He I. Porter et al. (2007) discussed this,
proposing that the most likely explanation is a deviation from case
B of the He I 𝜆𝜆 537.0 and 522.0 lines, that go to the ground level,

partially escaping before being reabsorbed. This is probably the case
in the high-velocity components where any kind of self-absorption
of photons emitted by the “static” nebular gas should be reduced.
The adopted He+/H+ values are presented in Table 6.

5.2.2 O2+ abundance
In Table D15, we present the O2+ abundance obtained from RLs
of O II. We use 𝑇e(high) and the values of 𝑛e obtained from O II
(see section 4.3.1) and [Fe III] lines for the nebular and high-velocity
components, respectively. We used the recombination coeﬃcients
calculated by Storey et al. (2017) that consider the distribution of
population among the O2+ levels with some improvements over sim-
ilar estimates from Bastin & Storey (2006). Previous references (as
Storey 1994) assumed that the O2+ levels are populated according to
their statistical weight, which is not suitable for densities below the
critical one.

In Table D15, we also present the weighted average abundance
for each multiplet. In the last row of Table D15 we give the O2+
abundance obtained averaging the values obtained for multiplets 1,

No emission from HH 529 II is observed, only the nebular component is
noticeable. These lines are produced from transitions of quintet levels (Grandi
1975a) and arise purely by recombination. Due to high spectral resolution and
the earth motion during the observations, these lines are free of blending with
sky lines.

2, 10, 20 and 3𝑑 − 4 𝑓 transitions. These multiplets and transitions
give consistent values and were also considered by Esteban et al.
(2004) for determining their mean values. However, we decided to
consider only the abundance obtained from multiplet 1 as represen-
tative of the O2+ abundance, as we show in Table 6. This is because,
although it gives values consistent with the average of the other afore-
mentioned multiplets and transitions, the inclusion of multiplets with
fainter lines increases the formal uncertainties of the ﬁnal mean O2+
abundance.

5.2.3 Determination of the abundance of other heavy elements

based on RLs.

Due to the high quality of our deep spectra, we were able to deter-
mine abundances of other heavy element ions such as O+, C2+ and
Ne2+ based on the ﬂuxes of RLs and the recombination coeﬃcients
presented in Table D4.

O+ abundances were obtained from the lines of multiplet 1 of O I
𝜆𝜆 7771.94, 7774.17 and 7775.39 together with the adopted density
and temperature of the low ionization zone for each component of
each cut. Due to the high spectral resolution of our data, these O I
lines are not blended with telluric emission features, as is shown
in Fig 10. We do not detect the lines of multiplet 1 of O I in the
high-velocity components. In these cases, we have estimated upper
limits of their intensity and corresponding abundances considering
an hypothetical line with a ﬂux of 3 𝜎 of the rms of the adjacent
continuum. The resulting O+ abundances and the estimated upper
limits for the high-velocity components are shown in Table 6.

For C2+ and Ne2+, we adopt the temperature of the high ioniza-
tion zone for each component of each cut. C II RLs from diﬀerent
transitions were considered to derive C2+ abundances, as is shown
in Table D16. Multiplet 6 of C II present two lines at 4267.00 and
4267.18+4267.26 Å resolved at our spectral resolution, as shown in
Fig. 11. In general, lines from all multiplets of C II considered give
consistent values of C2+ abundances. RLs from multiplet 1 of Ne II
were used to calculate the Ne2+ abundance. Although they are rather
faint lines (see Fig. 12), the Ne2+ abundances derived from Ne II 𝜆𝜆
3694.21 and 3766.26 lines for each component of cut 2 are consistent
with each other. In addition, the Ne2+ abundance we derive for the
nebular component in cuts 2 and 3 is in good agreement with that
obtained by Esteban et al. (2004, see their Table 11).

6 TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS
We followed the 𝑡2-paradigm postulated by Peimbert (1967), by using
Eq. (10) from Peimbert & Costero (1969) and Eq. (10) from Peim-
bert et al. (2004), together with the measured 𝑇e(H I) and 𝑇e([O III])
in order to estimate 𝑡2 (Peimbert 2003; Esteban et al. 2004; García-
Rojas et al. 2004, 2005, 2007). Implicitly, this approach assumes
that 𝑡2 (H+) ≈ 𝑡2 (O2+) and 𝑇0 (H+) ≈ 𝑇0 (O2+). The same procedure
has been followed with eqs. (13) and (14) from Peimbert & Costero
(1969), together with the measured 𝑇e([S III]) and 𝑇e([N II]), respec-
tively, in order to estimate representative values of 𝑡2 for diﬀerent
ionization zones (Peimbert & Costero 1969; Esteban et al. 1998).
The analogous procedure has been used with Eq. (11) from Zhang
et al. (2005), to use the 𝑡2 dependence of the measured 𝑇e(He I). In
Table (7), we show the 𝑡2 and 𝑇0 values obtained for each combina-
tion. We have to emphasize the excellent agreement between using
𝑇e(H I) and 𝑇e(He I) together with the 𝑇e diagnostics based on CEL
ratios.

However, the above procedure may not be entirely accurate. From
the deﬁnition of 𝑇0 and 𝑡2 – eqs. (9) and (12) from Peimbert (1967) –
it is clear that these quantities depend on the integrated volume of gas.
Thus, since each ion X𝑖+ will have its own Strömgren sphere, each one
will have a representative 𝑡2 (X𝑖+) and 𝑇0 (X𝑖+). Considering another
ion, Y𝑖+, the assumption 𝑡2 (X𝑖+) ≈ 𝑡2 (Y𝑖+) will be only correct
if X𝑖+ and Y𝑖+ occupy the same nebular volume. Based on a set
of Cloudy photoionization models with diﬀerent input parameters,
Kingdon & Ferland (1995) derived 𝑡2 in two manners: as 𝑡2
str from
the formal deﬁnition and the 𝑡2
obtained from the comparison of
𝑇e(H I) and 𝑇e([O III]). They found that generally 𝑡2

is its high

Assuming the two ionization zones scheme for H II regions, a bet-
ter approximation to 𝑡2 can be obtained using eqs. (7) and (10) from
Peimbert et al. (2002). Then we need to estimate the fraction of O+
in the total O abundance. For the spectrum of the combined cuts, this
value varies from 0.36 to 0.23 according to whether the abundances
are determined from RLs or CELs, respectively. A reasonable ap-
proximation is to take the average value ∼ 0.3. On the other hand,
He+ should be present in both, the O+ and O2+ zones. Although there
may be coexistence of He0 and H+, the volume that He0 occupies
should be small at the ionization conditions of the observed area of
the Orion Nebula and it can be assumed that the volume containing
H+ and He+ should be approximately the same. This assumption is
reinforced by the fact that the parameter 𝜂 = (O+/O2+)(S2+/S+)
(Vilchez & Pagel 1988), which is a measure of the radiation hard-
ness and is anticorrelated with the 𝑇eﬀ of the ionizing source, has
a value of log(𝜂) = 0.74 for the “combined cuts” spectrum. Pagel
et al. (1992) showed that for log(𝜂) < 0.9, the amount of He0 is
negligible for a large variety of photoionization models. Therefore,
we can assume 𝑇0 (H+) ≈ 𝑇0 (He+) and 𝑡2 (H+) ≈ 𝑡2 (He+). Based
on the previous discussion, we use the 𝑇0 − 𝑡2 dependence of the
measured 𝑇e(H I) and 𝑇e(He I), for the “combined cuts” spectrum,
obtaining 𝑡2 (H+) ≈ 0.036 and 𝑇0 (H+) ≈ 8000 K. Using these val-
ues in Eq. (10) from Peimbert et al. (2002) and assuming that the
volume occupied by O+ and N+ is the same, and that to ﬁrst or-
der, 𝑇e ([O III])
≈ 0.85, we obtain 𝑇0 (O2+) ≈ 7580 and
𝑇0 (N+) ≈ 8950. Then, we estimate 𝑡2
high = 𝑡2 (O2+) ≈ 0.025 and
low = 𝑡2 (N+) ≈ 0.050.
𝑡2
The remarkably good agreement between these values and those
presented in Table 7 reinforces the suitability of the temperature
ﬂuctuations paradigm to describe the results in the “combined cuts”
spectrum. Considering the numerical values obtained, we adopt the
average values 𝑡2
inter = 0.051 ± 0.009 and
𝑡2
low = 0.064 ± 0.011, where the uncertainties correspond to the
standard deviation of the average. Unfortunately, 𝑇e(H I) based on
the Balmer and Paschen discontinuities can not be calculated for
the individual components of the diﬀerent cuts, and the estimations

high = 0.021 ± 0.003, 𝑡2

𝑇e ([N II]) ≈

of 𝑡2 must rely exclusively on the calculated 𝑇e(He I) . However,
calculations similar to those used to obtain the values presented
in Table 7 for the individual components of each cut show similar
results. These values are presented in Table D17. Considering the
higher uncertainty of the estimated 𝑡2 based on 𝑇e(He I) without
using 𝑇e(H I), we adopt the values of the “combined cuts” spectrum
as representative for the other components of each cut.

Following the same scheme described in Section 5.1, we recalcu-
late the ionic abundances assuming temperature ﬂuctuations and the
results are shown in Table 8.

7 THE ABUNDANCE DISCREPANCY FACTOR

A major problem in the analysis of photoionized regions is the dis-
crepancy between the chemical abundances derived from RLs and
CELs, known as the abundance discrepancy (AD) problem. The rel-
atively weak RLs, give systematically higher abundances than CELs.
This diﬀerence is commonly quantiﬁed through the abundance dis-
crepancy factor (ADF, Liu et al. 2000), deﬁned here as:

ADF (cid:16)X𝑖 (cid:17)

= log

RLs

(cid:33)

.

(7)

(cid:32) 𝑛 (cid:0)X𝑖 (cid:1)
𝑛 (cid:0)X𝑖 (cid:1)

CELs

There is an extensive collection of works dedicated to this prob-
lem in the literature (see Torres-Peimbert et al. 1980; Liu et al. 2001;
Stasińska et al. 2007; García-Rojas & Esteban 2007; Tsamis et al.
2011; Nicholls et al. 2012; Gómez-Llanos & Morisset 2020, and ref-
erences therein). Although there is no deﬁnitive solution, there are
several hypotheses to explain the AD. For example, temperature ﬂuc-
tuations (see Section 6), which would primarily aﬀect abundances
based on CELs, underestimating the real values; semi-ionized gas
clumps, overestimating abundances based on RLs and underestimat-
ing those of CELs; chemical inhomogeneities with diﬀerent physical
conditions, aﬀecting both estimates depending on each speciﬁc case
and so on. It is even possible that the AD is the result of the sum
of various phenomena aﬀecting each nebula in a diﬀerent degree.
Using a set of deep spectra of Galactic H II regions, García-Rojas
& Esteban (2007) found that the ADF is fairly constant around a
factor 2, showing no trend with ionization degree, 𝑇e or the eﬀec-

tive temperature of the ionizing stars. They found that temperature
ﬂuctuations is the most likely explanation for the AD in H II regions.
In Table 9, we present the ADF obtained from O+, O2+, Ne2+ and
C2+ abundances determined from RLs and CELs for each compo-
nent. The abundances based on CELs do not consider temperature
ﬂuctuations. In the case of C2+, the value of the abundance from CELs
have been taken from the UV observations reported by Walter et al.
(1992). We have considered the mean value of their positions number
5 and 7, which are the nearest to our slit and give 12+log(C2+/H+)
= 7.835. We do not estimate the ADF(C2+) for the high-velocity
component since the UV CELs values can only be compared with
the nebular component. We emphasize that the estimated value of
𝑡2 comes from the comparison of diﬀerent temperature diagnostics
and the formalism described in Section 6. Therefore 𝑡2 > 0, does
not necessarily mean ADF > 0, unless the measured value of 𝑡2 is
compatible with this.

From Table 9, it is remarkable that the ADF is slightly diﬀerent
for each ion and higher in the high-velocity components. Compar-
ing the values included in Table D15 and Table 8, we can see that
using the value of 𝑡2 adopted for each ionization zone of the nebu-
lar components, the O2+ abundances based on CELs become fairly
consistent with those determined from RLs. In the case of the O+
abundances, although the CELs abundances obtained with 𝑡2 > 0
do not agree completely with those obtained from RLs, they become
clearly more similar. Deﬁnitively, this is not the case for the Ne2+
abundances, in which values determined from CELs and RLs still
do not agree even considering 𝑡2 > 0. The results obtained for O2+
and O+ suggest that the temperature ﬂuctuation paradigm may be
capable of explaining the ADF, at least for these ions, the ones with
the best abundance determinations based on RLs. Among diﬀerent
scenarios, the existence of H-deﬁcient clumps has been advocated as
a possible cause of the very high ADF values found in some PNe (e.g
Péquignot et al. 2002). Since the heating of ionized gas is mainly due
by photoionization of H and He and the cooling by the emission of
CELs of metallic ions, this scenario implies signiﬁcant lower tem-

peratures in the clumps (Péquignot et al. 2002). As we mentioned
in Section 4.3.1, the 𝑇e(O II) determined for the nebular component
of cut 2 (which must be representative of the other nebular compo-
nents) is consistent with 𝑇e([O III]) within the uncertainties, which
rules out the aforementioned scenario in the nebular components
analysed in this work. The situation seems to be diﬀerent for the
high-velocity components. Assuming 𝑡2 > 0, the ionic abundances
obtained from CELs do not increase enough to match the values ob-
tained from RLs. For example, in the case of HH 529 II, considering
the adopted value 𝑡2 = 0.021, the ADF(O2+) is reduced from 0.29
to 0.11 but is not zero. Even if we consider the value of 𝑡2 = 0.025
from Table D17, the ADF(O2+) would be 0.08. A similar situation
is found in HH 529 III, where for 𝑡2 = 0.021 the ADF(O2+) is 0.20
while considering 𝑡2 = 0.030 the ADF(O2+) would be 0.12. Since
we do not ﬁnd evidence of higher temperature ﬂuctuations than those
previously commented, these results suggest the presence of another
physical process apart (or in addition) to the classic description of
temperature inhomogeneities to explain the ADF. A similar result
was found by Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009) in the case of HH 202 S
(see their Sec 5.5). For the high-velocity components, the presence
of a H-deﬁcient material can not be discarded as we will discuss in
Section 8.3.

8 TOTAL ABUNDANCES

We have to use ionization correction factors (ICFs) to estimate the
contribution of unseen ions to the total abundance of some elements.
Following the detailed analysis of Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020),
we have used the ICF schemes for C, N, Ne and Ar adopted by
those authors, which are shown in Table 10. In the case of S, He,
Fe and Ni, we use the ICFs from Stasińska (1978), Kunth & Sargent
(1983), Rodríguez & Rubin (2005) and Delgado-Inglada et al. (2016),
respectively. Results of total abundances based on CELs are presented
in Table 11 and in Table 12, for the cases of 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 >

0, respectively. Total abundances based on RLs are presented in
Table 13. In this case, we do not expect signiﬁcant changes in the
total abundances within the temperature ﬂuctuation paradigm due to
the low dependence of RLs on temperature. The ICFs are generally
based on the degree of ionization indicated by the abundance ratio
of O ions. For consistency, in the case of abundances based on
CELs, we use the degree of ionization determined also with CELs.
An analogous procedure is applied for abundances determined from
RLs.

8.1 Total abundances with CELs

8.1.1 Oxygen, Chlorine and Argon

The total abundances of O, Cl and Ar were obtained by adding the
ionic abundances of the observed ions. Although in HH 529 III we
could not estimate the Cl+ abundance, its calculated upper limit
shows that its contribution is negligible. It should be noted that,
in the case of Ar, the ICF model of Izotov et al. (2006) indicates
that the contribution of Ar+/H+ to the total Ar abundance is also
negligible in all the analysed components. The Cl/O and Ar/O ratios
are consistent with the solar values recommended by Lodders (2019)
within the uncertainties, whether we use abundances determined
from CELs considering 𝑡2 = 0 or 𝑡2 > 0. In addition, there are no
appreciable diﬀerences between the Cl/O and Ar/O ratios determined
in the nebular and the high-velocity components.

8.1.2 Nitrogen, Neon and Sulfur

The total abundances of N, Ne and S depend strongly on the adopted
ICF values. The schemes used for these elements are indicated in Ta-
ble 10. The estimated fraction N/N+ can reach values between 4 and
16 for the nebular and the high-velocity components, respectively.
This indicates that the ICF values are rather uncertain at the high
degree of ionization of the high-velocity components. However, in
the nebular ones, the average value of log(N/O) = −0.86 ± 0.02 is in
very good agreement with the suggested solar value of −0.88 ± 0.14
(Lodders 2019), while in the case of 𝑡2 > 0, log(N/O) = −0.98±0.02

is still consistent within the relatively large uncertainties of the solar
abundance ratio.

Rubin et al. (2011) determined the Ne/H ratio of the Orion Nebula
from FIR spectra taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope, that per-
mitted to detect ﬁne-structure [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines, avoiding the
use of ICFs. They obtain 12+log(Ne/H) = 8.01±0.01, which is con-
sistent with the Ne/H values we obtained for the nebular component
assuming 𝑡2 > 0. It is important to remark that the intensity of FIR
CELs has a very small dependence on 𝑇e. Therefore, the agreement
between the Ne/H ratios obtained from FIR CELs and optical ones
assuming 𝑡2 > 0 supports the temperature ﬂuctuations paradigm for
describing the spectral properties of the nebula.

The Ne/O and S/O ratios are rather similar in the nebular and high-
velocity components. The average values of log(Ne/O) are −0.64 ±
0.02 and −0.61 ± 0.02 for 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0, respectively, which
are consistent with the solar value of −0.58 ± 0.12 (Lodders 2019)
within the uncertainties. In the case of S/O, the average values of
log(S/O) for 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0 are −1.50 ± 0.05 and −1.63 ± 0.05,
respectively, while the solar value is −1.58 ± 0.08 (Lodders 2019).

8.1.3 Nickel and Iron

Ni/H abundances are estimated using the ICF scheme derived by
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2016) and are presented in Table 11 and
Table 12 for 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0, respectively. The estimation of this
abundance is rather uncertain as discussed in Section C.

In the case of Fe, considering the absence of He II lines in our spec-
tra, we do not expect to have Fe4+ in the nebula and therefore Fe/H =
Fe+/H++Fe2+/H++Fe3+/H+. We have determined the abundance of
Fe2+ and Fe3+ in all the components of each cut except in HH 529 III,
where we could only estimate an upper limit to Fe3+/H+. In the high-
velocity components, the absence of usually relatively intense [Fe II]
lines as 𝜆𝜆4287, 5158 and 5262, together with the high ionization
degree of the gas, indicates a negligible contribution of Fe+ to the to-
tal abundance. Thus, in these cases Fe/H=Fe2+/H++Fe3+/H+. In the
nebular components, although a large number of [Fe II] lines have
been detected, their emission is mainly produced by ﬂuorescence
(Rodríguez 1999; Verner et al. 2000) and most of the observed lines
will not provide reliable estimates of Fe+ abundance. Unfortunately,
[Fe II] 𝜆8617, a line almost insensitive to ﬂuorescence (Lucy 1995;
Baldwin et al. 1996) can not be observed due to the physical gap of
the CCDs in the Red Arm of UVES. However, previous studies with
direct estimations of Fe+ in the Orion Nebula as Rodríguez (2002)
or Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009), obtain Fe+/Fe+2 ratios between 0.05
and 0.27. Considering the approximation Fe/H = Fe2+/H++Fe3+/H+,
the neglected Fe+/H+ ratio would contribute to Fe/H up to 0.06
dex in the worst case (calculating Fe+2/H+ with 𝑇e (high) and as-
suming Fe+/Fe+2 = 0.27). This maximum contribution is within the
range of uncertainties associated with the sum of Fe2+ and Fe3+

abundances and therefore, it seems reasonable to consider Fe/H ≈
Fe2+/H++Fe3+/H+ for the nebular component as well.

Rodríguez & Rubin (2005) proposed two ICFs for Fe, one derived
from photoionization models and other based on observations with
detection of [Fe III] and [Fe IV] lines. The values of Fe/H obtained
using both ICFs are discrepant, perhaps due to errors in the atomic
data of the ions involved. The true total Fe abundance is expected to be
in between the values obtained from both ICFs (Rodríguez & Rubin
2005; Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014). We use the aforementioned ICFs
only for HH 529 III and we give its Fe/H ratio as the interval of values
obtained from both ICFs, as it is shown in Table 11 and Table 12.

In HH 529 II, the abundances of Fe/H and Fe/O are higher than in
the nebular components independently of whether the temperature
𝑇e(low) or 𝑇e(high) is considered to derive Fe2+/H+. The same be-
havior is observed in HH 529 III for 𝑡2 = 0, although the uncertainty
in Fe/H do not allow us to be conclusive in the case of 𝑡2 > 0. How-
ever, as is discussed in Section 4.2, the representative temperature to
derive Fe2+/H+ in HH 529 II and HH 529 III is likely to be 𝑇e(high)
while in the nebular components is 𝑇e(low).

Considering the discussion above, the average log(Fe/O) value
in the nebular components is −2.53 ± 0.02 while for HH 529 II
it is −2.14 ± 0.08, both values computed assuming 𝑡2 = 0. This
represents an increase of the gaseous Fe abundance by a factor of
2.45 in HH 529 II. The same increase is observed when considering
𝑡2 > 0. For HH 529 III the increase is between 1.78 and 4.37.
Taking the solar value of log(Fe/O) = −1.28 ± 0.08 recommended
by Lodders (2019), we ﬁnd that only 6% of the total Fe is in gaseous
phase in the nebular component, while this fraction increases to 14%
in HH 529 II and between 10% and 25% in HH 529 III. In the case
of HH 202 S, Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009) found that the gaseous
phase fraction is around 44%. The evidence of dust destruction on
HH shocks is also present in non-photoionized objects (see Hartigan
et al. 2020, and references therein). This is shown by the relative
enhancement of the Fe emission lines with respect to the emission of
other non-depleted elements in areas where shock waves are present.
These results are consistent with theoretical studies predicting that
fast shocks are eﬀective at destroying dust grains (see Jones et al.
1994; Mouri & Taniguchi 2000, and references therein). However, it
is possible to have partial depletion of Fe in jets (Antoniucci et al.
2014). An evidence of surviving dust is the detection of thermal
emission of dust at 11.7 𝜇m coincident with HH 529 II and III as
well as HH 202 S (Smith et al. 2005). A key factor is to explore
correlations between the Fe abundance and some properties of the
HH objects, such as their velocity, density or distance to the ionizing
source.

8.2 Total abundances with RLs

8.2.1 Helium

Considering the absence of an ionization front in HH 529 II and
HH 529 III because of the non-detection of emission lines of neutral
elements in their spectra, it is likely that the He0/H+ ratio should be
negligible in the high-velocity components and, therefore, we can
assume He/H = He+/H+. In the nebular components, we estimate
the fraction of neutral helium within the ionized zone making use
of the ICF scheme by Kunth & Sargent (1983), obtaining that the
He0/He fraction is approximately 10%. This value is consistent with
the other ICF schemes tested by Méndez-Delgado et al. (2020) for the
Orion Nebula. In Table 13, we can see that the He/H ratios obtained
for all the cuts are in complete agreement.

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

8.2.2 Oxygen

The total O abundances based on RLs are determined directly from
O/H = O+/H+ + O2+/H+. In the high-velocity components, the
estimated upper limits to the O+ abundances indicate that this ion
can contribute up to 0.05 to the total O abundance. Thus, for these
high-velocity components the O abundance is assumed to be equal
to the ionic abundance of O2+.

8.2.3 Carbon and Neon

In the case of the high-velocity components, due to the high degree
of ionization estimated from the ionic O abundances based on RLs,
we expect to have small or negligible contributions of the ions once
ionized from Ne and C to their total abundances. For the nebular
components, we use the same ICFs schemes of Peimbert & Cos-
tero (1969) and Berg et al. (2019) for Ne and C, respectively, using
ionic abundances based on RLs exclusively. It is important to note
that this last ICF has been optimized for low-metallicy objects (up
to 12+log(O/H)=8.0). However, Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020) have
shown that its use for higher metallicity objects provides consis-
tent results. For comparison, in Table 13, we present the C/H ratio
obtained using the ICF proposed by Amayo et al. (in prep, private
communication), whose scheme is optimized for a wider range of
metallicities, including the solar one.

The resulting log(Ne/O) values based on RLs are −0.44 ± 0.03 and
−0.23±0.10 for the nebular components and HH 529 II, respectively.
This indicates an overestimation of the Ne abundance based on RLs
in HH 529 II, since it is signiﬁcantly larger than the solar one. In
the case of C, we obtain log(C/O) = −0.20 ± 0.02 using the ICF
of Berg et al. (2019) and −0.26 ± 0.02 using the scheme of Amayo
et al. (in prep) in the nebular components. This last value is more
consistent with the recommended solar value of −0.26 ± 0.09 by
Lodders (2019). The log(C/O) value for HH 529 II is −0.37 ± 0.08
while for HH 529 III is −0.28 ± 0.12.

8.3 A slight higher metallicity in the high-velocity components?

An interesting result of our analysis is that the metal abundances are
higher in the high-velocity components, HH 529 II and HH 529 III,
than in the nebular ones. In the case of the O abundance, that diﬀer-
ence can reach up to 0.14 dex, regardless if abundances are calcu-
lated with CELs or RLs. Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009) estimated that
0.12 ± 0.03 dex of log(O/H) is depleted into dust grains in the Orion
Nebula. In principle one may explain the 0.14 dex increase of O/H
in the HH objects as produced by dust destruction, and that all the O
locked in grains has been released to the gas phase. Nevertheless, the
Ar/O, Ne/O, S/O and Cl/O ratios remain almost the same in all com-
ponents. Since Ar and Ne are noble gases, they can not be depleted
into dust grains and, therefore, lower abundance ratios would be ex-
pected if dust destruction is increasing the gaseous O abundance.
In addition to this, considering that the O trapped onto dust grains
is in olivine (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, pyroxene (Mg, Fe)SiO3 or oxides like
Fe2O3, then the gaseous O must grow in proportion to the release of
elements like Fe to the gas phase. Considering this, Mesa-Delgado
et al. (2009) estimated that 0.06 dex of log(O/H) can be attributed to
dust destruction in HH 202 S. As we mention in Section 8.1.3, the
proportion of gaseous Fe present in in HH 529 II and HH 529 III
is lower than in HH 202 S, and therefore, the expected increase of
log(O/H) in the two bow shocks of HH 529 should be consequently
less than 0.06 dex.

BMB06 also report a higher O abundance in HH 529 with respect

to the nebular one. The diﬀerence they obtained was slightly larger
than ours, of around 0.2 dex. This value is conﬁrmed in the later
reanalysis of BMB06 data carried out by Simón-Díaz & Stasińska
(2011). However, as we discussed in Section 3, part of the larger
diﬀerence found by BMB06 with respect to our O/H ratio may be
due to their underestimation of I(H𝛽), as we illustrate in Table D1.

Assuming that the abundance diﬀerence between the kinematical
components is real, one possible explanation is that the bulk of the
material of the HH objects comes from H-deﬁcient material expelled
by the source of the gas ﬂow. As we mentioned in Section 7, an H-
deﬁcient ionized gas should be colder than one with normal chemical

composition but this in not observed (see Table 4). This may be
because the possible over-metallicity is actually small, which might
not signiﬁcantly alter the temperature. The origin of the H-deﬁcent
material may be in the evaporation of protoplanetary discs around
newly formed stars (Yuan et al. 2011), a probable scenario for the
origin of HH 529. In this sense, it is a well-known fact that HH 529
is a source of IR emission (Robberto et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2005),
emitting strongly at 10𝜇m and 11.7𝜇m. Smith et al. (2005) show
that the 11.7𝜇m radiation arises from thermal dust emission and is
visible both behind the leading bow shock and within the jet body of
HH 529 (see their Fig. 7). After analysing diﬀerent scenarios, Smith

J. E. Méndez-Delgado et al.

et al. (2005) conclude that the dust may be entrained from the origin of
the jet, which implies that at least part of the ejected material comes
from a radius larger than the sublimation radius in the accretion
disc of the source. Some of this material may originally come from
H-deﬁcient solids. However, the mechanism of expulsion of this H-
deﬁcient material and its interaction with the ambient gas requires a
deeper analysis of solid body destruction in new formed stars, an idea
further explored in planetary nebulae (Henney & Stasińska 2010).
Tsamis et al. (2011) obtained deep optical integral ﬁeld spectroscopy
of the LV2 proplyd in The Orion Nebula, determining, for the ﬁrst
time, the chemical composition in this kind of objects. They ﬁnd that
the abundances of O, C and Ne in the ionized gas of the proplyd are
between 0.11 and 0.52 dex higher than in the rest of the nebula. This
result is somehow qualitatively consistent with the overmetallicity we
ﬁnd for the bow-shocks of HH 529, supporting the possibility that
the entrained material of the HH objects may come from the source
of the gas ﬂow. However, the abundance pattern found for LV2 is not
conﬁrmed in the proplyd HST 10, where the chemical composition is
not substantially diﬀerent from the nebular gas (Tsamis et al. 2013).
Finally, we should keep in mind that the apparently larger metal-
licity of the HH objects may be simply produced by the atomic data
used for the analysis. As Juan de Dios & Rodríguez (2017) have
discussed, uncertainties in the atomic data may be more important
for high-density objects (densities above 104 cm−3) because there is
less possibility to check them observationally. Subsequent analysis
of new photoionized HH objects, whose analysis we are carrying out,
can shed further light on this issue.

9 KINEMATICAL ANALYSIS FROM UVES DATA

We calculate the radial velocity of each line in the heliocentric frame-
work by comparing its observed wavelength (after applying the radial
velocity correction) with its theoretical wavelength in air. All the the-
oretical values have been taken from the Atomic Line List v2.05b21
(Van Hoof 2018). Wavelengths from this compilation list are mainly
calculated from the theoretical energy diﬀerence between the levels
connected by the transition. The exception are the hydrogenic lines,
which include a weighted average of all the ﬁne structure compo-
nents.

We detect some evident inaccuracies in the theoretical wavelengths
of [Cl III], [Cl IV] and [Ne III] in the Atomic Line List v2.05b21. This
conclusion is based on the discrepant velocities that those lines show
with respect to the rest of lines in the high-velocity components,
that show fairly similar velocities independently of the ionization
state of the ions and elements (see Section 9.1). For example, in the
case of [Ne III] 𝜆𝜆3869, 3967, the Atomic Line List v2.05b21 gives
𝜆𝜆3869.07±0.09 and 3967.79±0.10 based on the works of Persson
et al. (1991) and Feuchtgruber et al. (1997). These wavelengths give
velocities about −20 km s−1 displaced with respect to the mean ve-
locity obtained for the rest of the lines. In this case, we decided to
adopt the wavelengths 𝜆𝜆3868.75 and 3967.46 obtained by Bowen
(1955) from high-resolution spectroscopy of nebulae. The [Cl III]
and [Cl IV] lines show a similar problem; in this case, we adopt the
reference wavelengths used by Esteban et al. (2004) that give con-
sistent velocities. The wavelengths adopted for [S III] lines deserve
special attention. The values given by the Atomic Line List v2.05b21
are 𝜆𝜆6312.1±0.36, 8829.4±0.49, 9068.6±0.52 and 9530.6±0.57,
taken from the work by Kaufman & Martin (1993). There is a small
(but noticeable at our spectral resolution) discrepancy in the ve-
locity obtained for [S III] 𝜆6312 and the rest of the lines of about
10 km s−1. Assuming the velocities measured for the H I lines of

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

HH 529 II, our best estimation of the rest wavelengths of the observed
[S III] lines are: 𝜆𝜆6312.07±0.01, 8829.70±0.01, 9068.93±0.04 and
9530.98±0.01.

9.1 Radial velocity structure

In Table D18, we present the average velocity and full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of each ion observed in the nebular component
of cut 2 and in HH 529 II and III. The behaviour of the nebular
component of cut 2 is representative of what is observed in the
nebular components of the other cuts. In each column, we include in
parentheses the number of lines of each kind whose values have been
averaged. In this analysis, we discard lines with known blends and
those aﬀected by ghosts or by telluric emissions/absorptions. For O I,
O II, C II and Ne II lines, we include only those used in Section 5.2 for
abundance determinations, which are the lines that are assumed to be
produced by pure recombination and are most probably not aﬀected
by ﬂuorescence. In the special case of [S III] lines we consider only
the 𝜆6312 line, due to the aforementioned evident inaccuracies in the
theoretical wavelengths of the rest of the [S III] lines. Fig. 13 shows
the heliocentric velocity as a function of ionization potential relation
for the data collected in Table D18.

From the upper left panel of Fig. 13, it is clear that the nebular
component presents a pattern consistent with the “blister” model for
the Huygens Region of the Orion Nebula (O’Dell 2001; Ferland 2001;
O’Dell et al. 2020, and references therein). The basic idea is that a
layer of gas of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) facing the direction
towards the Sun is ionized by 𝜃1 Ori C, which is located in the
foreground of OMC. As the gas gets ionized, it is accelerated towards
the observer. Velocities of [O I], [C I], and [N I] are similar to the
average velocity of the molecules in the OMC of ∼ 28 km s−1 (Goudis
1982; O’Dell 2018, and references therein), then a rapid drop in the
observed velocity (which means an increase in velocity compared to
the OMC’s systemic velocity) of the ions whose ionization potential
are between 6.77 and 13.6 eV is observed as well as a constant
velocity after 13.6 eV. This behaviour has been observed in previous
works (Kaler 1967; Fehrenbach 1977; O’Dell & Wen 1992; Esteban
& Peimbert 1999).

In the lower panels of Fig. 13, we present the observed radial veloc-
ity of the ions as a function of their ionization potential for the high-
velocity components: HH 529 II (lower left panel) and HH 529 III
(lower right panel). Contrary to what the nebular components show,
all the ions of the high-velocity components show a fairly constant
radial velocity, independently of their ionization potential. Moreover,
the high-velocity components do not show emission lines of neutral
ions. These features are consistent with the scenario of a fully ionized
slab of gas moving at a diﬀerent velocity with respect to the rest of
the nebular gas.

In the upper right panel of Fig. 13, we present the diﬀerence
between the radial velocity pattern of the nebular component and
HH 529 II (the subtraction of the upper and lower left panels of
Fig. 13) rescaled using the average radial velocity of 51 H I lines
in HH 529 II, whose rest-frame reference wavelengths 𝜆0 are the
best determined among all the ions. Doing that subtraction, we can
see that the dispersion of the data points represented initially in the
upper left panel decreases substantially. This fact indicates that the
dispersion is not due to errors associated with the determination of
the wavelength of the lines or to a complex velocity structure, but
to inaccuracies in the adopted rest-frame reference wavelengths or
possibly in the wavelength calibration. By eliminating the aforemen-
tioned dispersion, we can demonstrate that the acceleration of the gas
in the Orion Nebula is constant for ionization potential between 6.77

and 13.6 eV, becoming zero for energies above, reaching a constant
velocity of 16.4 ± 0.8 km s−1.

There is a diﬀerence of 5.18 ± 1.25 km s−1 between the radial
velocities of HH 529 II and III. This is due to the presence of unre-
solved lower velocity components in HH 529 III, as it is shown in
Fig. 14, which also contribute to increase the dispersion in the radial
velocity structure of this component.

The radial velocities of the selected O I, O II and Ne II lines are
practically the same as those of [O II], [O III] and [Ne III] CELs,
respectively, in the nebular component. This reinforces the assump-
tion that they are produced by pure recombination. For example, lets
consider the O I RLs from multiplet 1, which come from quintuplet
levels. If these lines were produced by ﬂuorescence, they would be
emitted in neutral and partially ionized zones of the nebula and should
show a radial velocity similar to the systematic one of the OMC. In
fact, O I lines from transitions between triplet levels (such as multiplet
4 𝜆𝜆8446.25, 8446.36, 8446.76) are displaced around ∼ 10 km s−1
with respect to the velocity of the aforementioned multiplet 1, clearly
indicating the diﬀerent nature of both multiplets, with the lines of
multiplet 4 originating in starlight excitation (Grandi 1975b).

9.2 Electron temperature from thermal broadening of the line

The observed line widths are the result of several physical processes.
Apart from the instrumental width, 𝜎ins, the main contributors are
the thermal width, 𝜎th, the ﬁne structure broadening, 𝜎fs and the non-
thermal contribution, 𝜎nt, which includes eﬀects such as turbulence
and any other additional broadening process. Following García-Díaz
et al. (2008, hereinafter GHLD08, see their equation 2), we use
Eq. (8) to express the relationship commented above.

of the observed widths of H I and [O III] lines. The instrumental width
aﬀects the same for both kinds of lines and should be cancelled in the
fs (H I) = 10.233 (km s−1)2, ﬁnding
subtraction. GHLD08 estimated 𝜎2
that 𝜎2
nt (H I) is not
strictly equal to 𝜎2
nt ([O III]), since the nebular volume occupied by
both ions is diﬀerent. GHLD08 deﬁne 𝑓 as the fraction of the volume
of H+ occupied by O2+ and (1- 𝑓 ) the fraction ﬁlled by O+ and other
ions with lower degree of ionization, as N+. We assume the average
value (cid:104) 𝑓 (cid:105) = 0.76 estimated by GHLD08 for the Orion Nebula. Using
equations 7 to 10 from GHLD08, we obtain 𝑇e = 8340 ± 410 k for the
nebular component. In the case of the high-velocity components, we
assume 𝑓 = 1.0, obtaining 𝑇e = 8670 ± 50 K and 𝑇e = 10470 ± 790
K for HH 529 II and HH 529 III, respectively.

The resulting 𝑇e values in the nebular component of cut 2 and
HH 529 II are in remarkably good agreement with 𝑇e([O III]) from
CEL ratios as shown in Table 4. In the case of HH 529 III, the large
diﬀerence between the values obtained from both methods may be
due to the contamination by several unresolved velocity components,
as it is shown in Fig. 14 and discussed in Section 10, that broadens
the lines, providing overestimated temperatures.

10 PROPER MOTIONS OF HH 529 II AND III

The plane-of-sky motions of the bow shocks in HH 529 have been
previously reported in Table 3 of O’Dell & Henney (2008) and in
sec 3.3.1.3 of O’Dell et al. (2015). However, the reported tangen-
tial velocities are very disparate, so we have re-measured the proper
motions, using HST imaging over 20 years as described in Sec-
tion 2. The 1995 and 2015 images were aligned to the 2005 ACS
image using Astrodrizzle5 and rebinned to the ACS pixel scale of
0.05 arcsec. The 2005 image itself has been aligned to the abso-
lute astrometric reference of 2MASS, as painstakingly described in
sec 3.3 of Robberto et al. (2013). Proper motions are estimated for the
two intervals, 1995–2005 and 2005–2015, using the Fourier Local
Correlation Tracking (FLCT) method (Welsch et al. 2004; Fisher &
Welsch 2008)6 with a kernel width of 10 pixels (0.5 arcsec). For an
assumed distance of 417 pc, a shift of 1 pixel in 10 years corresponds
to approximately 10 km s−1. A potential disadvantage of using the
ACS data in this study is that the F658N ACS ﬁlter is relatively
broad and includes both H𝛼 𝜆6563 and [N II] 𝜆6583, whereas the
WFPC2 and WFC3 F656N ﬁlters are narrower and more eﬀectively
isolate 𝜆6563. Ionization gradients in the nebula can therefore con-
tribute to diﬀerences in the images obtained, which would obscure
the signal due to the gas motions. However, the degree of ionization
in HH 529 III and II is so high that this turns out not to be an issue
in this object. Results are presented in Table 14 and Figure 14.

We ﬁnd that HH 529 III consists of at least two distinct moving
structures. The large outer curved bow, which we call III a, is rela-
tively smooth, spanning about 7 arcsec in its brightest part, but with
fainter wings (best visible on the ratio image) that extend farther. We
cover the bright part of the bow with 5 sample ellipses: a1 to a5,
where a3 seems to be the apex of the bow but a2 is the one that falls
in the UVES slit. Roughly 0.7 arcsec to the east of III a is a smaller,
knottier bow, which we call III b and cover with 3 sample ellipses:
b1, b2 and b3. The brightest knot is b2, but it is the b1 sample that
falls in the UVES slit. HH 529 II is found to consist of three distinct
bows with separations of order 1 arcsec, which we call II a, II b, and
II c, with II a and II b falling in the UVES slit.

Considering the OMC reference frame (28 ± 2 km s−1, Goudis
1982), we obtain 𝑣tot values of 62.68 ± 3.30 km s−1 and 67.01 ± 3.09
km s−1 for HH 529 III and HH 529 II, respectively. To obtain those
numbers we have used the weighted average tangential motion of
35±5 km s−1, calculated with components a, b, a2 and b1 of HH 529
(see Fig. 14) and the radial velocities shown in Table D18). On the
other hand, using the ratio between the average tangential and radial
velocities and considering a systematic uncertainty of ∼ 2 kms−1
between the OMC and the stellar source, we estimate a ﬂow angle
of 58 ± 4◦ for HH 529. This value is in agreement with the result
of O’Dell & Henney (2008) (∼54◦) but discrepant with the value
obtained by O’Dell et al. (2015) (∼83◦).

Further internal shocks may form inside the outﬂow if its velocity
varies with time (Raga et al. 1990). It is important to investigate the
degree to which direct excitation by the shocks might be aﬀecting
our emission line analysis.

In this section, we ﬁrst calculate the heating and compression
expected behind a shock wave and then we use results of non-
equilibrium Cloudy simulations to predict the relative contributions
of the post-shock cooling zone and the equilibrium photoionized
shell to the emission line spectrum of the knots.

estimate Ms = 5.31 ± 0.28 and Ms = 5.68 ± 0.27 for HH 529 III
and HH 529 II, respectively, on the assumption that both are external
working surfaces. By using the estimated densities of the HH objects
as post-shock densities, 𝑛2, in Eq. (11), we can estimate a value for
the pre-shock densities, 𝑛0. In the case of HH 529 III, we obtain
𝑛0 = 1070 ± 310 cm−3, a value that is consistent with photoionized
areas of the Orion Nebula outside the Huygens region, where the
density decreases radially (Mesa-Delgado et al. 2008). This would
place HH 529 III in the foreground of the main ionization front.
For HH 529 II, the pre-shock density, 𝑛0 = 370 ± 70 cm−3, would
indicate that the impact with the ambient gas is taking place in a more
external zone from where HH 529 III does, being located farther from
the main ionization front (and closer to the observer). However, this
scenario seems unlikely.

Considering the complex velocity structure of HH 529 II+III (see
Fig. 14), that HH 529 III is almost a factor 3 denser than HH 529 II,
that both objects present similar velocities (in the frame of reference
of the OMC) and ionization degree, it is likely that HH 529 II is rather
an internal working surface of the jet beam (Masciadri & Raga 2001).
In this case, the relevant Ms would be subsantially smaller than 5.68.
This internal shock may be due to temporal velocity variations in the
jet from the common source of HH 529 (possibly located at the star
COUP 666, O’Dell et al. 2015).

The absence of [O I] CELs (see Fig. 2) and the weakness of lines
of low ionization potential ions (e.g. [O II] or [N II]) demonstrate
that HH 529 II and HH 529 III are fully photoionized objects and
do not contain a trapped ionization front (Masciadri & Raga 2001),
contrary to what was found by Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009) in the case
of HH 202 S. Therefore, the entire jet beam should be observable
in optical emission lines, contrary to partially ionized or neutral HH
objects, where only limited regions can be observed in the optical
(Raga et al. 2000a,b). Since HH 529 is ﬂowing at an angle of ∼ 58◦
with reference to the plane of the sky, the observed spectra of the
HH objects should integrate both the compressed gas at the leading
working surface and the gas of the jet beam behind. Which of these
dominates the total emission depends on the relative densities of

motions of the shocked gas.

is the temperature, 𝑚H is the hydrogen mass and 𝜇 is the mean
atomic mass per particle. Assuming that all He is singly ionized with
𝑦 = He/H = 0.087 (Table 13) yields 𝜇 ≈ (1 + 4𝑦)/(2 + 2𝑦) ≈ 0.62,
which combined with 𝑇0 = 8480 K (Table 4) implies an adiabatic
sound speed of ∼ 13.7 km s−1.

The case of a magnetized shock is considerably more complicated
(Bazer & Ericson 1959), but the principle eﬀect is that the compo-
nent of the magnetic ﬁeld, 𝐵, parallel to the shock front provides
extra pressure support (magnetic cushioning) in the post-shock gas
(Hartigan et al. 1994; Hartigan & Wright 2015). An approximate way
to account for this is to replace the sound speed in the above equa-
tions by the fast magnetosonic speed: 𝑉fast = (𝑐2
A)1/2, where
𝑉A = 𝐵/(4𝜋𝜌)1/2 is the Alfvén speed. The ambient gas inside an H II
region is expected to have a low Alfvén speed of 𝑉A ≈ 2 km s−1 (cid:28) 𝑐s
(Arthur et al. 2011) so that the magnetic cushioning will be negligi-
ble in shocks propagating in the ambient medium. On the other hand,
the Alfvén speed in the jet itself (Hansen et al. 2015; Pudritz & Ray
2019) may be suﬃciently high so as to limit the compression behind
shocks driven into the jet.

the jet and the ambient medium (Hartigan 1989). In the case of
HH 529 III, it is possible that the two components, a and b, resolved
by HST (see Fig. 14) represent respectively the bowshock (shocked
ambient medium) and Mach disk (shocked jet). However, these are
unresolved in our slit spectra.

11.2 Shock emission versus shell emission

In order to estimate the shock contribution to the line emission from
the working surface, we are going to consider the high-temperature
radiative relaxation layer (cooling zone) that lies immediately behind
the shock.

The post-shock gas in the working surface will be accelerated
away from the jet axis by lateral pressure gradients, ﬂowing sideways
out of the working surface at the isothermal sound speed through a
“Mach ring” (Falle & Raga 1993), with radius approximately equal
to that of the jet, 𝑟jet. In a steady state, the outward mass ﬂux through
the Mach ring must be equal to the inward mass ﬂux through the
shock, while the isothermal Bernoulli equation shows that the den-
sity at the Mach ring is 𝑒−1/2 𝜌ws, where 𝜌ws is the density of the
working surface. This yields the thickness of the working surface as
𝐻 = 1
2 𝑒1/2𝑟jet/Ms. We assume that 𝑟jet = 2 mpc, which is half the
observed lateral extent of the HH 529 II knots7. The thickness of
the cooling zone, 𝑑cool is approximately the immediate post-shock
velocity multiplied by the cooling time. This implies that, in our case,
𝑑cool/𝐻 ≈ 0.1, being thin compared with the total thickness of the
working surface.

The contribution of this thin cooling zone should be equal to the

kinetic energy ﬂux through the shock:

whereas the radiative ﬂux from the cooled equilibrium gas in the
working surface is

𝐹2 = 𝑛2

2Λ0𝐻 erg cm−2 s−1,

(13)

where Λ0 is the cooling coeﬃcient of the equilibrium gas. Assuming
Λ0 = 2.5 × 10−24 erg cm3 s−1(Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), the ratio
of Eq. 12 and Eq. 13 is then:

We ﬁnd that 𝐹1/𝐹2 ≈ 0.1 for HH 529 III, whereas for HH 529 II,
assuming that HH 529 II moves at 20 km s−1 with respect to the
internal velocity of the jet beam, 𝐹1/𝐹2 ≈ 0.03. However, it should
be noted that, the 𝐹1/𝐹2 value found for HH 529 III is rather an upper
limit to the real contribution of the cooling area since we have used
the total velocity with respect to the OMC to deﬁne the Mach number,
while a shock within the photoionized gas of the Orion Nebula must
consider its internal velocity structure, which moves radially towards
the observer (see Sec. 9.1), as well as partially does HH 529. In
addition to this, although HH 529 III is observed as a prominent
arch, the possibility that it is preceded by other shocks cannot be
ruled out. As recent analyzes have shown, there is at least one high
ionization shock to the east of HH 529 III that may be related to
the gas ﬂow of HH 529 (Labeled as “East Shock” in O’Dell et al.
2015), in which case it would imply a lower Mach number than the
one used.

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

From an observational point of view, the spectrum of HH 529 III
𝐼 ( [O III] 𝜆5007)/𝐼 (H𝛽) = 0.69
have logarithmic values of
and 𝐼 ( [N II] 𝜆6584)/𝐼 (H𝛼) = −1.34, while HH 529 II have
𝐼 ( [O III] 𝜆5007)/𝐼 (H𝛽) = 0.69 and 𝐼 ( [N II] 𝜆6584)/𝐼 (H𝛼) =
−1.60. These values are in complete agreement with those expected
in star-forming regions, as shown by the curve derived by Kauﬀ-
mann et al. (2003) in their Eq. (1), based in photoionization models.
Furthermore, the values of log(𝐼 ( [S II] 𝜆6716 + 31)/𝐼 (H𝛼)) in both
components are ∼ −2.45, also consistent with the typical values of
ionized nebulae and very far from the range of values observed in
objects ionized by shock energy (between -0.5 and 0.5), such as su-
pernova remnants and non-photoionized HH-objects (Canto 1981;
Riera et al. 1989).

Finally, a value of 𝐹1/𝐹2 ≈ 0.1 in HH 529 III (i.e. a Mach number
∼ 5) would imply a post-shock temperature as high as 70 000 K (see
Eq. 9) in the thin cooling zone. At such high-temperature, the gas
emits predominantly at far-ultraviolet (FUV) wavelengths, via lines
such as C III] 𝜆1909 and C IV 𝜆1549, whereas most of the optical
lines studied in this paper are minor coolants in such conditions.
Therefore, even in this extreme case, the optical spectra analyzed in
this work would have a contribution probably much smaller than a
factor of 0.1.

We have calculated time-dependent photoionized shock models
using the Cloudy plasma physics code (Ferland et al. 2013, 2017)
in order to investigate this, taking the [O III] 𝜆5007 line as a typical
example. We ﬁnd that for gas in photoionization equilibrium with the
radiation ﬁeld from the Trapezium stars, a fraction 𝑓5007 = 0.33 of
the total radiative cooling is due to this line. For the cooling zones
behind low-velocity shocks, this fraction initially increases slightly
with shock velocity, reaching a maximum value 𝑓5007 = 0.37 for
𝑉s ≈ 20 km s−1, but subsequently declines, falling to 𝑓5007 = 0.11
for 𝑉s ≈ 70 km s−1 as the FUV lines take over the majority of the
cooling. The 5007-emission-weighted average temperature of the
cooling zone saturates at 𝑇 ≈ 16 000 K for 𝑉s > 50 km s−1, indicating
that the conditions in the post-shock [O III] emission zone become
insensitive to the shock velocity. For recombination lines such as
H𝛼, the emissivity declines with increasing temperature, so that the
contribution of the post-shock zone to the total emission is negligible.
On the other hand, for some weak lines we would expect a relatively
larger shock-excited contribution. For instance, an auroral line such
as [O III] 𝜆4363 has an excitation temperature that is roughly double
that of 𝜆5007, so will be relatively enhanced in the cooling zone.
However, in both high-velocity components, 𝑇e ([O III]) is consistent
with the values of the Orion Nebula, which implies that there are
no signiﬁcant eﬀects. Although in our case, all the indicators used
show that the shock contribution in the observed optical spectra of
HH 529 II and HH 529 III is negligible, the detailed eﬀects of post-
shock cooling on an optical spectrum clearly deserves a deeper study.

12 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have observed two of the bow shocks of the photoionized Herbig-
Haro object HH 529: HH 529 II and HH 529 III, inside the Orion
Nebula, under photometric conditions with the UVES echelle spec-
trograph at VLT. Our observations have an eﬀective spectral resolu-
tion of ∼ 6.5 km s−1 and cover a spectral range of 3100-10420Å. We
deﬁned 4 spatial cuts in our 10 arcsecs-long slit to separate HH 529 II
from HH 529 III. Our spatial and spectral resolution permitted us to
resolve the blueshifted high-velocity components of HH 529 II and
III from the nebular emission of the Orion Nebula. Thus, we analysed
6 1D spectra: 4 of the nebular emission and one of each bow shock.

We measured up to 633 emission lines in the Orion Nebula and 376
and 245 in the cases of HH 529 II and III, respectively. We deﬁned
an additional spectrum labeled as “combined cuts” with the sum of
all components to study the impact of the HH objects in a single
low-spectral resolution longslit observation. We also take advantage
of the 20 years of archival 𝐻𝑆𝑇 imaging to analyse proper motions
of HH 529 and their physical impact.

Considering the absence of emission lines of neutral elements such
as [O I] and the rather faint emission from low ionization ions such as
[O II] in HH 529 II and III, we conclude that they are fully photoion-
ized and present a high ionization degree. We analyze the inﬂuence
of the shock energy in our spectra of HH 529 II and HH 529 III
and all evidences indicate a certainly minor contribution, present-
ing values consistent with normal H II regions. We analysed 5 den-
sity diagnostics based on CEL ratios. We found a mean value of
𝑛e ≈ 6000 ± 1000 cm−3 for the nebular components. We obtain
𝑛e = 11880 ± 1860 cm−3 and 𝑛e = 30200 ± 8080 cm−3 for HH 529 II
and III, respectively, concluding that at so high values, the density
diagnostics based on [Fe III] lines are more suitable than the usual
ones. We determined the density of each component using the RLs
of multiplet 1 of O II, ﬁnding that it does not diﬀer from the one
derived from CELs in the nebular components. However, the results
based on O II RLs are inconsistent with other diagnostics in the case
of HH 529 II and III.

Using CEL ratios, we study 6 𝑇e-diagnostics. We derive mean val-
ues of 𝑇e(low) ≈ 10000 ± 200 K and 𝑇e(high) ≈ 8500 ± 150 K for
the temperature of the low and high ionization degree zones, respec-
tively, in the nebular components. For HH 529 II we obtain 𝑇e(low) =
10150+570
K and 𝑇e(high) = 8270 ± 110 K. For HH 529 III, we de-
−510
rive 𝑇e(low) = 11040+920
K and 𝑇e(high) = 8630 ± 120 K. These
−970
results indicate that the temperature are very similar in the nebular
and the high-velocity components, although there is a slight increase
in temperature in the shock front (HH 529 III). For the nebular com-
ponent of cut 2, we were able to estimate 𝑇e from O II RLs, obtaining
𝑇e (O II) = 9350 ± 1090. The good agreement between 𝑇e (O II) and
𝑛e (O II) with the physical conditions obtained with CELs in the neb-
ular components demonstrate that the emission of CELs and RLs of
O2+ come basically from the same gas, ruling out the possibility of
cold clumps dominating the emission in RLs. For all components,
we derive 𝑇e(He I) from He I RL ratios while in the “combined cuts”
spectra we were also able to derive 𝑇e(H I) using both the Balmer and
the Paschen discontinuities of the nebular continuum. In all the de-
rived physical conditions, we found no signiﬁcant deviation between
the results of the “combined cuts” spectrum and the individual nebu-
lar ones. We conclude that the emission of HH 529 II and HH 529 III
do not alter the physical conditions and abundances derived from low
spectral resolution spectra in areas of size of the order or larger than
10 arcsecs.

For HH 529 II, we obtained ADF(O2+) = 0.29 ± 0.10 dex and
ADF(Ne2+) = 0.79 ± 0.09 dex while for HH 529 III we obtained

HH 529 II and III in the Orion Nebula

ADF(O2+) = 0.36 ± 0.11 dex. The 𝑡2 values we obtained are capable
of account for the ADF(O2+) in the nebular components but not in
the ones corresponding to HH 529 II and III, where larger 𝑡2 values
would be needed to reproduce their ADF(O2+).

We estimate the total abundances of O, Cl, Ar and Fe without
ICFs in the nebular components. In the cases of HH 529 II and III, in
addition to the aforementioned elements (except Fe in HH 529 III),
we were also able to estimate the total abundances of He and C with-
out using an ICF. By using the Solar value of Fe/O as reference, we
estimate that 6% of the total Fe is in gaseous phase in the nebular
components while in HH 529 II this fraction reaches 14% and be-
tween 10% and 25% in HH 529 III. This increase should be due to
destruction of dust grains in the shock fronts. We found a slight over-
abundance of heavy elements (around 0.12 dex) in the high-velocity
components that can not be entirely due to dust destruction processes
since it aﬀects also the noble gases. We speculate that its possible
origin may lie in the inclusion of H-deﬁcient gas entrained after the
evaporation of material in the outer part of the protoplanetary disc
of the source of HH 529.

We found a constant value of the radial velocity of the emission
lines, irrespective of the ionization potential of the observed ions
in HH 529 II (𝑣𝑟 = −29.08 ± 0.36 km s−1) and HH 529 III (𝑣𝑟 =
−23.90 ± 0.89 km s−1). In the nebular emission of the Orion Nebula,
we demonstrate that the velocity varies linearly with the ionization
potential for ions with ionization potential between 6.77 and 13.6
eV, reaching a constant velocity of 16.4 ± 0.8 km s−1 for ionization
potentials greater than 13.6. From the thermal broadening of the
line proﬁles, we derived 𝑇e = 8340 ± 410, 𝑇e = 8670 ± 50 and
𝑇e = 10470 ± 50 for the nebular components, HH 529 II and III,
respectively. The determination for HH 529 III is anomalously large
due to the contamination by unresolved velocity components.

We determined the proper motions of HH 529 II and III by using
HST imaging over 20 years. We found several discrete features iden-
tiﬁed in the bow shocks. We estimated an average tangential velocity
of 35 ± 5 km s−1 for the HH 529 II-III system. We also estimate a
ﬂow angle with respect to the sky plane of 58 ± 4◦. Several indicators
evidence that HH 529 II corresponds to an internal working surface
of the jet beam.

ionization planetary nebulae (PNe) as NGC 3918 (García-Rojas et al.
2015).

Several authors used the 𝐼(O II 𝜆4649.13)/𝐼(O II 𝜆4089.29) ratio to
derive 𝑇e based on its theoretical dependence on 𝑇e and insensitivity
to 𝑛e (see e. g. García-Rojas & Esteban 2007; Fang & Liu 2013;
McNabb et al. 2013; Wesson et al. 2018). Nevertheless, Peimbert &
Peimbert (2013) discourages its use, due (among other reasons) to the
possible contamination of O II 𝜆4089.29 by the Si IV 𝜆4088.86 line,
which would lead to underestimating 𝑇e. The authors consider that
Si IV 𝜆4088.86 has been detected in 2 H II regions observed with
UVES echelle spectrograph at VLT telescope: the Orion Nebula
(Esteban et al. 2004) and 30 Doradus (Peimbert 2003). Although it
is a real possibility that a line like Si IV 𝜆4088.86 may be detected
in an H II region, much of the ﬂux attributed to this line is actually
due to an observational artifact of UVES spectrum.

Fig. D2 shows the echelle orders extracted in an UVES blue arm
spectrum using dichroic #2 (Δ𝜆 = 3750 − 4995). Optical reﬂections
produced by the dichroic #2 in the blue arm can be noted as vertical
lines crossing the echelle orders. These artifacts are negligible with
the exception of those produced by the most intense lines: [O III]
𝜆4959, H𝛽 and [O III] 𝜆5007. The last of those lines does not enter
in any complete echelle order in this arm, but it is partially observed
at the edge of the CCD, together with its associated high-velocity
component. As a consequence 4 main sources of “ghost lines” can
be noticed. The third of them (from left to right), aﬀects exactly the
𝜆4089.07 position in the echelle order number 11 (bottom up) in our
observations. Approximately at this wavelength we expect to have
the high velocity component of O II 𝜆4089.29 in cuts 2 and 3, but it
must be free of emission from HH 529 II and III in cut 4. Fig. D6
shows the emission around 𝜆4089.29 in the spectra of cut 4, a pretty
similar image than the Fig. 2 from Peimbert & Peimbert (2013).

In our spectra, an hypothetical Si IV 𝜆4088.86 line should be
observed at 𝜆4089.08, considering the kinematical structure of the
nebular component and the high ionization potential of the line (see
Section 9.1). This means that in case of being detected, the Si IV
𝜆4088.86 line would be indistinguishable from the ghost line at
𝜆4089.07. We have measured the intensity of ghost lines coming
from the same source than 𝜆4089.07 along the echelle orders but
excluding those ones which are blended with other nebular lines.
Fig. D3 shows the decreasing trend of the intensity of ghost emission
with respect to its source from higher to lower orders, as well as
a least squares ﬁt to predict ghost emission in order 11, where the
emission feature at 𝜆4089.07 lies. The predicted ghost emission in
𝜆4089.07 is 𝐹 (𝜆)
𝐹 (H𝛽) = 0.007 while the rms of the noise associated
with the continuum in cut 4 around 𝜆4089.07 represents a possible
contribution of 𝐹 (rms)
𝐹 (H𝛽) = 0.004. On the other hand, the measured
ﬂux of 𝜆4089.07 is 𝐹 (𝜆)
𝐹 (H𝛽) = 0.012. Thus, the emission observed
at 𝜆4089.07 is consistent with purely ghost emission. This ghost
emission aﬀects in a similar way the spectra of the Orion Nebula
and 30 Dor analysed by Esteban et al. (2004) and Peimbert (2003),
respectively.

The main drawback of the 𝑇e diagnostic based on the 𝐼(O II
𝜆4649.13)/𝐼(O II 𝜆4089.29) ratio in H II regions is that 𝜆4089.29
is rather weak, providing uncertain 𝑇e values. Therefore, this diag-
nostic will only be useful when the O II lines are well measured,
or when the object shows signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the 𝑇e of
the zone where the O II lines are formed and the rest of the nebula
(Wesson et al. 2018). Finally, although Si IV lines are expected to be
rather faint in normal H II regions, this may not be the case in high-

MNRAS 000, 1–27 (2021)

APPENDIX B: CL2+ AND CL ABUNDANCES
Domínguez-Guzmán et al. (2019) have proposed the use of 𝑇e([N II])
to determine the Cl2+ abundance in a sample of 37 Galactic and ex-
tragalactic H II regions, including the Orion Nebula (using the data
of Esteban et al. 2004). They argue that 𝑇e([N II]) reduces the dis-
persion of the Cl/O ratio and remove trends in the Cl/O versus O/H
relation. However, in a detailed study of each speciﬁc object, the
optimal temperature to adopt can diﬀer from what statistically would
be the best choice. Considering the IP of 23.8 eV of Cl2+, in between
of those of N+ (14.5 eV) and O2+ (35.1 eV), we expect that a 𝑇e rep-
resentative of an intermediate ionization zone as 𝑇e([S III]) should be
more appropriate for determining the Cl2+ abundance. The relation-
ship of 𝑇e([S III]) with 𝑇e([N II]) and 𝑇e([O III]) may depend on the
ionization degree of the gas (Berg et al. 2020). In our spectra, we are
able to calculate the total Cl abundance because we measure CELs
of all the ionization species of Cl that are expected to be present in
the Orion Nebula. We test the resulting Cl abundance considering
three diﬀerent temperatures: 𝑇e(low), 𝑇e([S III]) and 𝑇e(high) for de-
riving the Cl2+/H+ ratio. In Table D10, we present the Cl2+ and Cl
abundances as well as their corresponding log(Cl/O) values using
the three aforementioned temperatures.

Using 𝑇e(low), we obtain a log(Cl/O) value in the high-velocity
components about 0.1 dex lower with respect to the value found in
the nebular ones of the diﬀerent cuts. This suggests that 𝑇e(low)
is slightly underestimating the Cl/H ratio, although within the un-
certainties. Conversely, the Cl/O ratio becomes more consistent
when using 𝑇e([S III]) or 𝑇e(high) to estimate the Cl2+ abundance.
We obtain a mean log(Cl/O) value of −3.63 ± 0.04, −3.42 ± 0.03
and −3.50 ± 0.03 when adopting 𝑇e(low), 𝑇e(high) or 𝑇e([S III])
to calculate the Cl2+ abundance, respectively. The log(Cl/O) value
obtained using 𝑇e([S III]) is the one closest to the solar value of
−3.50 ± 0.09 recommended by Lodders (2019). Therefore, we ﬁnally
adopt 𝑇e([S III]) to estimate the Cl2+ abundance.

APPENDIX C: NI2+ ABUNDANCE
The ﬁrst estimation of the Ni abundance in an H II region was made
by Osterbrock et al. (1992) for the Orion Nebula. They used esti-
mates of the atomic data of Ni ions, considering [Ni II] and [Ni III]
lines. Since then, the number of Ni abundance determinations in ion-
ized nebulae is still very limited, both for PNe (Zhang & Liu 2006;
García-Rojas et al. 2013; Delgado-Inglada et al. 2016) and H II re-
gions (Mesa-Delgado et al. 2009; Delgado-Inglada et al. 2016). There
is a considerable amount of [Ni II] and [Ni III] lines in our spectra.
However, [Ni II] lines are aﬀected by ﬂuorescence (Lucy 1995) and
their use to calculate the abundance of Ni+ is restricted to some
particular cases as low-excitation nebulae (Zhang & Liu 2006). On
the other hand, [Ni III] lines are, in principle, not aﬀected by ﬂuores-
cence eﬀects and can be used to derive Ni2+ abundances. From all the
detected [Ni III] lines, we chose [Ni III] 𝜆𝜆6000, 6534, 6682, 6797,
6946 and 7890 because they are not aﬀected by blends or telluric
absorption.

As we commented in Section 4, all tested diagnostics based on
[Ni III] lines fail to provide reliable values of physical conditions, in-
dicating inaccuracies between the observed lines and the theoretical
predictions. Delgado-Inglada et al. (2016) studied the Fe/Ni ratio in

eight PNe and three H II regions, including the Orion Nebula. They
used diﬀerent datasets for these last objects, including the high spec-
tral resolution ones from Esteban et al. (2004) and Mesa-Delgado
et al. (2009) (which incluides HH 202 S), and some previously un-
published observations covering approximately the same area as the
Position 1 of Esteban et al. (1998) and the brightest part of the Orion
Bar. We have compared our data with some observed ﬂux ratios
compiled by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2016) looking for possible un-
detected line blends or observational inaccuracies. For convenience,
we have compared the predicted and observed ﬂux ratios of [Ni III]
𝜆𝜆6000, 6534 and 6946 lines that arise from the same atomic level
and therefore we expect that their intensity ratios should be constant.
In Table D11, we compare the observed ﬂux ratios and the predicted
ones using the atomic data of Ni2+ by Bautista (2001). As Table D11
shows, the [Ni III] 𝜆6534/𝜆6000 and 𝜆6946/𝜆6000 intensity ratios
are not inconsistent with the predicted ones. The most discrepant
case is HH 529 II, although it is the component with the greatest
dispersion. The intensity ratios based on the data sets with smaller
dispersion seems to indicate a systematic value of 𝜆6534/𝜆6000∼ 1.6
and 𝜆6534/𝜆6000∼ 0.30 which is compatible with an overestimation
of the ﬂux of the [Ni III] 𝜆6000 line. However, we discard the pres-
ence of sky emission aﬀecting this line. Beside to this, we do not ﬁnd
strong candidates of unusual lines in the literature or in the Atomic
Line List v2.05b21 with a wavelength diﬀerence below to 0.15 Å (a
conservative limit for an appropriate deblending of Gaussian proﬁles
at our spectral resolution). In addition, as can be seen in Table D12,
we ﬁnd an inconsistent pattern of Ni2+ abundances in all cuts and
components for the six selected lines, with diﬀerences up to 0.8 dex.
This may be a problem of the currently available atomic data of Ni2+,
which could not be accurate enough for deriving conﬁdent values of
its ionic abundances. Therefore, our Ni2+/H+ abundances must be
interpreted with care, since they may include unknown uncertainties.
