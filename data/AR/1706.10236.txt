We study collisions between neutral, deuterated ammonia molecules (ND3) stored in a 50 cm
diameter synchrotron and argon atoms in co-propagating supersonic beams. The advantages of
using a synchrotron in collision studies are twofold: (i) By storing ammonia molecules many round-
trips, the sensitivity to collisions is greatly enhanced; (ii) The collision partners move in the same
direction as the stored molecules, resulting in low collision energies. We tune the collision energy
in three diﬀerent ways: by varying the velocity of the stored ammonia packets, by varying the
temperature of the pulsed valve that releases the argon atoms, and by varying the timing between
the supersonic argon beam and the stored ammonia packets. These give consistent results. We
determine the relative, total, integrated cross-section for ND3 + Ar collisions in the energy range of
40–140 cm−1, with a resolution of 5–10 cm−1 and an uncertainty of 7–15%. Our measurements are
in good agreement with theoretical scattering calculations.

The crossed molecular beam technique, pioneered by
Dudley R. Herschbach and Yuan T. Lee, has yielded a
detailed understanding of how molecules interact and re-
act [1, 2]. Until recently, these crossed molecular beam
studies were limited by the velocities of the molecu-
lar beams to collision energies above a few 100 cm−1
(1 cm−1 (cid:39) 1.4 K). Over the last years, however, a number
of ingenious methods [3–5] have been developed to study
collisions in the cold regime. These advances are im-
portant for several reasons. Firstly, the temperatures of
interstellar clouds are typically between 10–100 K; colli-
sion data of simple molecules at low temperatures is thus
highly relevant for understanding the chemistry in these
clouds [6]. Furthermore, quantum eﬀects become impor-
tant at low temperatures where few partial waves con-
tribute and the de Broglie wavelength associated with the
relative velocity becomes comparable to or larger than
the intermolecular distances. Of particular interest are
resonances of the collision cross-section as a function of
collision energy [7–10]. The position and shape of these
resonances are very sensitive to the exact shape of the
PES and thus serve as precise tests of our understanding
of intermolecular forces.

The ability to control the velocity of molecules using
time-varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds has allowed col-
lision experiments at low collision energies [11, 12]. Re-
cently, inelastic collisions between Stark-decelerated NO
molecules and rare gas atoms have been studied with
ion imaging techniques, revealing interesting quantum
mechanical features such as Fraunhofer diﬀraction [13]
and resonance ﬁngerprints in the state-to-state diﬀeren-

tial cross-sections [14].

Another method uses cryogenically cooled beams un-
der a small (and variable) crossing angle. In recent exper-
iments, scattering resonances were observed in collisions
between O2 or CO and H2 molecules at energies between
5 and 30 K [15]. Even lower temperatures can be ob-
tained by using magnetic or electric guides to merge two
molecular beams into a single beam [16–18]. This tech-
nique has been used to observe orbiting resonances in
the Penning ionization reaction of argon and molecular
hydrogen with metastable helium [16, 19].

In a diﬀerent approach, trapped ions at millikelvin
temperatures are monitored while slow, velocity selected,
beams of molecules pass through the trap to study reac-
tive ion-molecule collisions [20, 21]. The ions are stored
for a long time and their number can be accurately deter-
mined, which allows the study of reactions with rates as
small as one per minute. In a similar fashion, collisions of
slow beams of ammonia with magnetically trapped OH
molecules were observed [22].

Here, we study collisions between neutral ammonia
molecules stored in a synchrotron and beams of argon
atoms. Using a synchrotron for collision studies oﬀers
two advantages: Firstly, the collision partners move in
the same direction as the stored molecules, resulting in
a small relative velocity and thus a low collision energy.
Secondly, the sensitivity to collisions is enhanced by stor-
ing the ammonia molecules for many round-trips. Our
approach thus combines the low collision energies ob-
tained in experiments that use merged molecular beams
[16–18] with the high sensitivity of experiments that

Figure 1: Schematic view of the synchrotron and beamline. Supersonic beams from a cooled Even-Lavie valve intersect the
synchrotron a quarter round-trip down-stream from the injection point. The argon beam is displaced from the equilibrium orbit
by a distance ∆x. The packets of argon (shown in green) are timed such that the probe packets (shown in red) encounter an
argon packet on every round-trip, while reference packets (shown in blue) provide a simultaneous measurement of background
loss. Bottom: time-of-ﬂight measurements of an argon beam at the two detection zones (black) and a packet of ammonia after

monitor trap loss [20–22].

The synchrotron used in our experiment is shown
schematically in Fig. 1. It consists of 40 electric hexapoles
arranged in a circle with a diameter of 0.5 m, to which
voltages of up to ±5 kV are applied. With these settings,
we store packets of ND3 molecules in the low-ﬁeld seek-
ing sublevel of the J=1, K=1 rovibrational ground state
with velocities in the range of 100–150 m/s. At any time
during the experiment, 14 packets of ammonia molecules
are held by the synchrotron. Each packet of this train is
stored for up to 1.2 s, while at a 10 Hz rate new packets
are being injected in front of the train and packets at the
back of the train are being detected. In order to allow
packets emerging from a Stark decelerator (not shown) to
enter the ring, 4 hexapoles are temporarily switched oﬀ.
In the detection zone, a quarter ring downstream from
the injection point, molecules are ionized via the (cid:101)B-state
using light around 317 nm and pushed towards an ion
detector by temporarily switching 2 hexapoles to the ap-
propriate voltages. More details on the synchrotron and
injection beamline can be found in Zieger et al. [23–25].

When the vacuum system is kept under vacuum for
many weeks, the pressure reaches 5×10−9 mbar. Under
these conditions the 1/e-lifetime of the stored packets
is 3.2 s, determined equally by collisions with the back-
ground gas and black-body-radiation-induced transitions
to non-trappable states [23]. In the current experiment
the pressure is typically 2×10−8 mbar, resulting in a life-
time of 1.0 s. A typical time-of-ﬂight proﬁle of a packet
that has been stored for 90 round-trips is shown in red
in Fig. 1.

The stored packets of ammonia molecules are made to
collide with beams of argon atoms released by a pulsed
Even-Lavie valve [26], which can be operated at temper-
atures between −150 and +30◦C. The pulsed valve is
operated at 160 Hz, two times the cyclotron frequency of
the stored ammonia packets, such that every tenth ND3
packet will encounter a fresh Ar packet every round-trip.
We will refer to these packets as probe packets. Pack-
ets that do not encounter the argon beam, referred to
as reference packets, provide a simultaneous measure-
ment of background loss. Note that packets directly be-
fore or after the probe packets may have some overlap
with the argon beam. Collisions between stored ammo-
nia molecules and argon atoms will (almost always) cause
ammonia molecules to be lost from the trap as the lon-
gitudinal and transverse trap depths (≤1.1 mK [25]) are
much smaller than the collision energies. The argon beam
is displaced from the equilibrium orbit of the stored am-
monia molecules by about 1.6 mm such that it intersects
the path of the ammonia molecules twice. This simpliﬁes
the analysis (vide infra).

As shown in Fig. 1, the relative intensities of the
Ar beams are monitored at two positions:
480 mm
downstream from the valve and inside the detection
zone of the synchrotron, 1250 mm downstream from the
valve. The argon atoms are detected by 3+1 Reso-
nantly Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) via
the 3s23p5(2P1/2)4s-state [27] using a pulsed UV-laser
running at 314 nm. The arrival time distributions mea-
sured at the two detection zones are used to derive the
longitudinal velocity distributions. The black curves in

Fig. 2 shows the number of ammonia molecules in
the probe beam (red squares) and reference beam (blue
squares) as a function of storage time. In this particu-
lar experiment hydrogen molecules are used as collision
partner. The solid lines show the result of ﬁts to the data
using the expression n = n0 e k·RT , with n the number of
detected ions per shot, RT the number of round-trips
the packets have made before being detected, and k the
loss-rate. For the reference packets we ﬁnd a loss-rate of
1.40% per round-trip, corresponding to a lifetime of 1.0 s.
For the probe packets, we ﬁnd a loss-rate of 2.66% per
round-trip, which implies that collisions with the super-
sonic beam induce an additional loss-rate of 1.26% per
round-trip.

The orange data points in the lower panel of Fig. 2
show the loss-rate due to collisions calculated from the
number of
ions detected in the probe and reference
beams at speciﬁc round-trip numbers, using kcol =
− ln(nprobe/nref )/RT . The error bars reﬂect the sta-
tistical spread of the ion signal. The uncertainty of
kcol decreases dramatically during the ﬁrst round-trips
and reaches an optimum after ∼70 round-trips, at which
point only 14% of molecules in the probe beam remain.
When the storage time is increased further, the uncer-
tainty of the measured probe beam intensity becomes
the limiting factor and the uncertainty of kcol increases.
The orange dash-dotted lines show the expected statis-
tical uncertainty, assuming the number of detected ions
is governed by Poisson statistics, which is in good agree-
ment with the experimental results. Note that the devi-
ations from a perfect exponential decay of the probe and
reference signals observed in the upper panel of Fig. 2
are absent in the extracted loss-rate shown in the lower
panel. This is a crucial feature of our method: ﬂuctu-
ations due to, for instance, intensity and/or wavelength
drifts of the laser, temperature variations of the valve, or
collective oscillations of the packet inside the synchrotron
are common to the reference and probe signals and are
divided out.

Of critical importance is the delay between the trigger
of the valve that releases the argon atoms and the arrival
time of the ND3 probe packet in the detection zone. This
delay determines whether the ammonia molecules collide
with atoms located more in the leading or trailing end
of the argon packet, or, in fact, whether they collide at
all. Furthermore, as the ﬂight time from the valve to the
synchrotron is much larger than the opening time of the
valve, there is a strong correlation between the position
of the argon atoms and their velocity. Hence, the de-
lay determines the velocity of the argon atoms that are
encountered by the ammonia beam. Note that in our
experiments, the relative velocities are such that ammo-
nia molecules only see part (20–30%) of the argon packet

3

during the time they spend in the collision zone.

The loss-rates of ND3 molecules (with velocities of
121.1 m/s and 138.8 m/s) due to collisions with argon
atoms (with velocities around 570, 524, 475, and 422 m/s)
were measured as a function of the aforementioned delay.
Each data point is the result of 2,400 shots–corresponding
to a measurement time of 4 minutes. To be robust against
possible drifts of the Ar beam density, the data were
taken while toggling between the two ammonia speeds
after every data point and picking the timings from a list
in a random order. The results for an ammonia veloc-
ity of 121.1 m/s are shown in panels a–d in Fig. 3. Each
measurement can be seen to feature two peaks, resulting
from the fact that the argon beam intersects the syn-
chrotron at two distinct locations. These peaks become
less well resolved as the argon packets become slower and
concomitantly longer.

Additional data were taken at three speciﬁc timings
for both ammonia velocities. These data are shown as
the colored symbols in Fig. 3. Each of these is the result
of 21,600 shots, corresponding to a measurement time of
36 minutes per point. To detect and correct for possi-
ble drifts of the Ar beam density, we cycled nine times
through the six diﬀerent conﬁgurations. No signiﬁcant
drifts were detected.

The solid curves in Fig. 3 show results of a simulation
of our experiment. The simulation uses as input (i) the
longitudinal position and velocity distributions of the ar-

loss-rate due to collisions can be determined at each number

tistical uncertainty based on the number of detected ions per

gon beams taken from the time-of-ﬂight proﬁles at two
locations, (ii) the shape and size of the cross-section of
the argon beams taken from measurements where the
height of the laser beam was scanned, from measure-
ments where the position of the valve was scanned, and
from the geometry of our beam machine, (iii) the horizon-
tal displacement of the argon beam from the equilibrium
orbit determined from the time diﬀerence between the
maxima in the measured loss-rates, and (iv) the veloc-
ity and equilibrium radius of the synchronous molecule
taken from simulations of the synchrotron [25]. For each
combination of valve temperature and ammonia veloc-
ity, the simulated curves are scaled vertically to ﬁt the
black data points in Fig. 3. As seen from the ﬁgure, the
simulations describe the measurements very well, which
conﬁrms that we have an excellent understanding of the
experiment.

The scaling factors obtained by ﬁtting the simula-
tions to the measurements are the products of the col-
lision cross-sections and the absolute column densities
of the argon beams at the corresponding valve tempera-
tures. Hence, by dividing the scaling factors by the rel-
ative column densities of the argon beams, derived from
time-of-ﬂight measurements in the detection zone of the
synchrotron, we obtain the relative total cross-sections.
These are shown as the black data points in Fig. 4. The
blue, red, and gray points in Fig. 4 are found by scal-

ing the simulations to the data points measured at the
front, center, and back of the argon packet (the coloured
points shown in Fig. 3). The vertical error bars rep-
resent the statistical uncertainties of the measurements,
ranging from 7 to 15%, while the horizontal error bars
represent the spread in collision energy, retrieved from
the simulations, and range from 5 to 10 cm−1. The data
taken in the fast part of the beam (the blue datapoints)
have the best energy resolution. The data points taken
by averaging over the entire velocity distribution have
smaller uncertainties but their energy resolution is worse.
The collision cross-sections determined from the diﬀerent
data sets agree with each other within their combined er-
rors, although the cross-sections retrieved from colliding
ammonia molecules with the fast part of the argon beam
(blue data points) appear to be systematically smaller
than the cross-sections retrieved from colliding ammonia
molecules with the slow or center part of the argon beam.
The line depicted in Fig. 4 is the result of theoretical
calculations described in [28], convoluted with a normal
distribution with a standard deviation of 5 cm−1. The
measurements are collectively ﬁt to this calculation with
a single global scaling factor that represents the density
of the argon beam at T = −150◦C, which is found to be
4.1×1010 cm−3. Although the ND3 + Ar collision cross-
section in this energy range does not show spectacular
features, the shallow minimum around 70 cm−1 predicted

In conclusion, we have performed collision experiments
between argon atoms in a supersonic beam and ND3
molecules stored in a synchrotron. Our measurements
demonstrate that storing molecules for many round-
trips increases the sensitivity dramatically, while co-
propagating beams allow low collision energies to be stud-
ied, hence providing a robust and general method to mea-
sure the total cross-section for low energy collisions. Our
method has a number of additional features that make
it attractive: (i) By comparing packets that are simul-
taneously stored in the synchrotron, the measurements
are independent of the ammonia intensity and immune to
variations of the background pressure in the synchrotron.
(ii) As the probe packets interact with many argon pack-
ets, shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations of the argon beam are aver-
aged out. By toggling between diﬀerent ammonia veloci-
ties and timings every 4 minutes, slow drifts of the argon
beam intensity are eliminated. The collision energy is
currently limited by the large diﬀerence between the ve-
locity of the stored molecules and the velocities in the su-
personic beam. Lower collision energy could be reached
by using molecules from cryostatically cooled beams as
collision partner [29] and/or by using a larger synchrotron
which would be able to store ammonia molecules at a
higher velocity.
Ideally, a synchrotron would be used
that can store molecules directly from a supersonic beam
without deceleration. Furthermore, one would like to
store beams both clockwise and anticlockwise in the syn-
chrotron, which makes it possible to perform calibration
measurements at high energy. Note that if the veloci-
ties of the beams are more similar, the energy resolution
will also be improved [30]. Collision studies with para-
magnetic atoms and molecules could be performed in a
magnetic synchrotron [31].
