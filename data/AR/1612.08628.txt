2 .

In the ﬁnal section of [CL2] we compared our study of the distribution of sieve functions in arithmetic
bands to the classical results on the distribution in arithmetic progressions, which deal mostly with the
overcoming of the so-called level 1/2. In fact, our present results, insofar they generalize our previous ones,
already go beyond level 1/2.

Here we discuss the possibility of going beyond 1/2 + θ/2 in the present contest of the sieve functions in
arithmetic bands, namely by taking Q > √N 1+δH for a certain small and ﬁxed δ > 0, so that N 1+εH/Q =
o(Q), provided δ > ε. Indeed, in section 3 we exhibit a particular sieve function whose behavior in arithmetic
bands conﬁrms the optimality of such level.

2. Length inertia in arithmetic bands.
In [CL1] we studied the so-called length inertia property for weighted Selberg integrals (see [CL2] for the
link between such integrals and the distribution of a sieve function in arithmetic bands). Such a property
permits transfer of non-trivial bounds in short intervals of length h, say, to similar bounds in longer intervals
of length H =
). Here we show that a length inertia property holds also
for the distribution of a sieve function in arithmetic bands. Indeed, we have

If Q > √N 1+δH for a certain δ > 0, then N 1+εH/Q = o(Q) once ε < δ, that yields the desired conclusion.

4. Concluding remarks.
Sieve functions are ubiquitous in analytic number theory. Besides the truncated divisor sum ΛR (see [G]),
that is a linear combination of sieve functions of range R (see [CL2] for our remarks on ΛR), we quote the
so-called restricted divisor function

τQ(n)

def

= (1Q ∗

1)(n) =

1,

Xd|n,d≤Q

N. We refer the reader to [T] for results on
whose Eratosthenes transform is the indicator 1Q of [1, Q]
the distribution of τQ in short arithmetic progressions. Here we wish to stress that in [T] one ﬁnds also
conjectures and average results concerning the distribution in arithmetic bands of the more complicated
function

∩

τQ,R(n)

def

= (1Q ∗

1R)(n) =

1Q(d)1R(t).

X(d,t)

dt=n

Such an essentially bounded function is linked to the pair correlation problem for fractional parts of the
R (compare also [S]). While in [T], Conjecture 1.2, it is pursued
quadratic function αk2, with k
the research of an upper bound for

N and α

, with (r, q) = 1,

Xa≤H Xn≡ar (q)

under suitable conditions on H, Q, R, here our Theorem leads to an asymptotic formula for the inverse
Eratosthenes transform of τQ,R in arithmetic bands, namely for

Xa≤H Xn≡ar (q)

(τQ,R ∗

µ)(n).

4

In [CL3] we established an asymptotic inequality for the exponential sum associated to the localized divisor
functions, a family of functions including the aforementioned τQ, τQ,R, and the standard divisor function dk,
k
2 (recall that dk(n) is the number of ways to write n as a product of k positive integers). The particular
instance of such an inequality for dk is

≥

dk(n)e(nα)

≪k,ε (N q)ε(N/q + q + N 1−1/k),

Xn∼N

∈

[a/q

1/q2, a/q + 1/q2], with (a, q) = 1, q > 1. Somehow, this can be regarded as being analogous
for all α
to the inequality which follows by combining (1) with (2). Such a circumstance is remarkable even in view of
the fact that any dk falls short of being a sieve function, with a sort of Eratosthenes transform which turns
out to be the sum of dk−1 plus some restricted divisor functions (see the last section of [CL1]).

−

Finally, since the function proposed in section 3 seems to be rather artiﬁcial in that it depends on a
(Q, 2Q], an intriguing open question to ask is how many standard sieve functions

ﬁxed modulus q
might support the optimality of the level accomplished by our Theorem and the results of [CL2].
