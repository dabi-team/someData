Abstract For the ﬁrst time, a small dual-phase (liq-
uid/gas) xenon time projection chamber was equipped
with a top array of silicon photomultipliers for light
and charge readout. Here we describe the instrument
in detail, as well as the data processing and the event
position reconstruction algorithms. We obtain a spatial
resolution of ∼ 1.5 mm in the horizontal plane. To char-
acterise the detector performance, we show calibration
data with internal 83mKr and 37Ar sources, and we de-
tail the production of the latter as well as its introduc-
tion into the system. We ﬁnally compare the observed
light and charge yields down to electronic recoil energies
of 2.82 keV to predictions based on NEST v2.0.

1 Introduction

Detectors that use liquid xenon are widely employed in
the ﬁeld of astroparticle physics. In particular, dual-
phase (liquid/gas) time projection chambers (TPCs)
are used for direct dark matter detection, searches for
the neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe, as well as
other rare event searches [1, 2].

A deﬁning requirement to observe a rare interac-
tion is an ultra-low background rate, to maximise the
signal-to-background ratio and thus the sensitivity to
a given search channel. This is achieved via the reduc-
tion of the radioactivity levels of detector materials, the
deﬁnition of central detector regions via ﬁducialisation
to beneﬁt from the self-shielding power of liquid xenon,
and the distinction between single and multiple interac-
tions. The latter rely on precise position reconstruction
capabilities of the interaction sites.

In a dual-phase TPC, particle interactions are de-
tected by observing prompt scintillation light (S1) and

a delayed (S2) signal caused by ionisation electrons,
drifted and extracted into the gaseous phase where they
produce electroluminescence. Both S1 and S2 signals
are observed by photosensors. The depth of an interac-
tion is given by the drift time between S1 and S2, while
the (x, y)-position is derived from the light distribution
in the photosensor plane placed in the gas phase above
the liquid.

Many past dark matter searches based on liquid
xenon TPCs [3–5] and experiments under construc-
tion [6, 7] employ VUV-sensitive photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs) which have been optimised for low levels of ra-
dioactivity and are up to 3 inches in diameter [3, 8–10].
However, they are among the dominant sources of elec-
tronic (ER) and nuclear recoil (NR) backgrounds, and
they limit the (x, y)-position resolution, which is cor-
related to their size. Next-generation detectors such as
DARWIN [11] and nEXO [12, 13] aim to reduce the
backgrounds further, and consider the use of silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs) for one or both photosensor
planes.

Motivated by these future experiments, and by
our previous studies of VUV-sensitive SiPM arrays in
single-phase detectors [14], we have built and charac-
terised the ﬁrst dual-phase xenon TPC equipped with
a top photosensor array containing 16 SiPM channels
read out individually. The new detector is based on our
previously described Xurich II TPC [15], with several
modiﬁcations as detailed below. The calibration of the
detector, i.e. the determination of its charge and light
response parameters was performed with two sources,
83mKr and 37Ar, which allow us to investigate ER in-
teractions at low energies.

This article is structured as follows: We describe the
detector in Section 2 and the 37Ar calibration source
in Section 3. We detail the data taking and process-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

ing tools in Section 4, and show the analysis of data
acquired with both internal calibration sources in Sec-
tion 5. We present and discuss the results in Section 6,
and summarise the main ﬁndings, addressing some chal-
lenges facing future detectors in Section 7.

2 The Xurich II detector with SiPM readout

The current TPC is an upgrade of the Xurich II de-
tector operated at the University of Zurich (UZH) and
described in [15]. The upgrade focuses on two aspects:
the replacement of the top PMT with an array of
SiPMs and their read-out electronics, and the design
of a stand-alone setup to introduce the gaseous 37Ar
calibration source into the xenon recirculation loop.

The detector is placed inside a vacuum-insulated
stainless steel vessel which is coupled to a liquid ni-
trogen bath via a copper cold ﬁnger. The TPC drift re-
gion is deﬁned by a 31 mm×31 mm (diameter × height)
polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) cylindrical shell with a
cathode mesh at the bottom and a gate mesh at the top,
shown in Figure 1. The anode is placed 4 mm above the
gate. The liquid surface was kept in the middle of the
two top electrodes, at ∼ 2 mm above the gate for the
presented data, optimised for S2 ampliﬁcation. Seven
copper ﬁeld-shaping rings, separated by PTFE spacers
and connected via a resistor chain, ensure a uniform
drift ﬁeld, which is maintained between the negatively
biased cathode and the gate at ground potential. By
varying the cathode voltage, we can acquire data at
diﬀerent drift ﬁelds. For the 83mKr source, we acquired
data in the range 194 − 968 V/cm while we probed the
interval 80 − 968 V/cm for 37Ar. The electron extrac-
tion ﬁeld is created between the gate and the positively
biased anode and was kept constant at 10 kV/cm by
setting the anode to a nominal voltage of +4 kV.

The xenon is continuously puriﬁed of electronega-
tive impurities by circulating the gas phase through
a hot metal getter, an integral part of the gas han-
dling system. The gas system features a source cham-
ber which allows for the introduction of 83mKr from
the decay of 83Rb with T1/2 = 86.2(1) d [15, 16]. With
an additional gas mixing setup, described in Section 3,
that can be connected in parallel to the 83Rb source
chamber, we also deploy a gaseous 37Ar source.

The S1 and S2 signals are detected by a 2-inch di-
ameter PMT (R6041-06 MOD, Hamamatsu Photon-
ics), placed in the liquid phase at the bottom of the
TPC, and sixteen 6 × 6 mm2 VUV4 SiPMs (2 × 2 ar-
ray of S13371, Hamamatsu Photonics) placed in the gas
phase. To install the SiPMs in the TPC, a PTFE holder
which exactly replaced the area occupied by the former

Fig. 1 Rendering of the upgraded Xurich II TPC. The ac-
tive liquid xenon (LXe) is contained within a PTFE cylinder
and surrounded by copper ﬁeld-shaping rings. A 2-inch PMT
is placed in the liquid, and an array of 16 SiPMs is placed in
the gaseous phase at the top. For the sake of visualisation,
two ﬁeld-shaping rings have been cut. Legend: 1 – PCB with
×10 preampliﬁer, 2 – SiPM array, 3 – Anode and gate mesh,

top PMT was designed and built. The SiPMs were ar-
ranged in the holder to maximise the light collection
eﬃciency (LCE) as studied in MC simulations [17]. The
distance from the surface of the SiPMs to the anode is
5 mm, optimised to obtain good position resolution.

The new conﬁguration of the TPC requires 17 read-
out channels, 15 more than in the previous design. To
handle this number of cables in the small detector,
we installed a new CF-40 feedthrough for 20 double-
shielded coaxial signal cables (RG 196) for the pho-
tosensors and 7 Kapton® insulated wires for voltage
biasing. To independently read out the 16 SiPM chan-
nels, a printed circuit board (PCB) was designed. Each
SiPM, on its cathode side, is connected in series with
a 10 kΩ resistor to the bias voltage to limit the cur-
rent and avoid possible damage to the device. On its
anode side, each SiPM is grounded with a 50 Ω resistor
and coupled to a custom-made ×10 voltage ampliﬁer
circuit [17]. The main component of the circuit is the
ultra-low noise, non-inverting voltage feedback opera-
tional ampliﬁer OPA847 from Texas Instruments. This
ampliﬁer has a nominal gain of 20 when connected to
an open circuit at the output and is able to reduce the

electronic pick-up noise to a negligible level. It operates
from direct current to 250 MHz and has a 50 Ω output
impedance that matches the input impedance of the
ADC. These two resistances form a voltage divider at
the ampliﬁer output. Because of this loading eﬀect, the
eﬀective ﬁnal signal ampliﬁcation with a 50 Ω load from
the ADC is tenfold. The heat dissipation of the entire
ampliﬁer board is ∼ 3 W, whereas it was negligible for
the former 2-inch PMT base. This additional heat load
can safely be handled by the cooling system of the de-
tector. Located in the warmer gas phase at ∼ 190 K, the
SiPMs have shown an error-weighted mean dark count
rate of (8.05±0.03) Hz/mm2 at a bias voltage of 51.5 V,
which is consistent with the temperature behaviour we
reported [14]. The dark count rate is the uncorrelated
noise rate above a threshold of 0.5 photoelectrons (PE)
in scintillation-free data acquired with nitrogen gas in
the TPC under very similar thermodynamic conditions
to those observed when using xenon.

3 The 37Ar calibration source

The 37Ar isotope decays with T1/2 = 35.01(2) d via
electron capture into stable 37Cl, with a Q-value of
813.9(2) keV [18]. Depending on the inner atomic shell
from which the electron is captured, 2.82 keV, 0.27 keV
and 0.0175 keV X-rays and Auger electrons are re-
leased (K-, L-, and M-shell, respectively, see Table 1 for
the corresponding branching ratios). These oﬀer mono-

of four fused quartz ampules, made at the glassblow-
ing facility at UZH and ﬁlled with natural argon 6.0
(purity ≥ 99.9999 %) at a pressure of 0.8 bar or 0.9 bar,
corresponding to 2.3 mg and 2.7 mg respectively, were
each activated for an irradiation time of 3.75 hours.
Analytically, we expect an initial 37Ar activity between
19 − 22 kBq per ampule. The use of natural argon gives
rise to the activation of two other relevant isotopes:
39Ar from 38Ar and 41Ar from 40Ar. Of less relevance
are 43Ar from 42Ar, of which only traces are present in
natural argon, and 42Ar itself from secondary activation
of 41Ar.

As the natural abundance of 38Ar is more than ﬁve
times lower and its cross section for thermal neutrons
is more than six times lower, we expect to have pro-
duced 39Ar with an activity lower than 0.23 Bq per am-
pule. It decays with a half-life of 268 y into its stable
daughter 39K solely via beta decay with an endpoint of
565 keV [23].

The high abundance of 99.6 % of 40Ar yields a high
activity of 41Ar shortly after the irradiation. This re-
quired that the activation happened in two steps with
a cool down time in between. 41Ar decays into stable
41K with a half-life of 109.6 min [24]. Hence, its activ-
ity decreased below 1 Bq after 2 days and was negligi-
ble after ∼ 160 days when the source was introduced
into the detector. Similarly, if 43Ar (T1/2 = 5.4 min)
had been produced, it would have been negligible after
a short time as the subsequent decay of its daughter
isotope 43K into stable 43Ca takes place with a half-
life of 22.3 h [25]. The secondary activation of 41Ar to
42Ar (T1/2 = 32.9 y), which decays via 42K into stable
42Ca [26], is negligible as well since the initial activity
can be calculated to be ∼ 50 µBq.

energetic lines with uniformly distributed events in the
TPC that can be used for calibrations down to low ER
energies [20–22].

3.1 Source production

The 37Ar source was produced by thermal neutron ac-
tivation, where the process 36Ar + n → 37Ar + γ with
a capture cross section of ∼ 5 b was exploited. We used
natural argon gas with a 0.334 % 36Ar abundance. The
activation took place between the 4th and 7th Decem-
ber 2018 at the Swiss Spallation Source (SINQ) at Paul
Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen (Switzerland), provid-
ing a thermal neutron ﬂux of ∼ 1013 cm−2s−1. A total

To introduce the 37Ar source into the TPC, the quartz
ampules must be placed and broken inside the gas sys-
tem. We designed and built a dedicated system that
contains a mixing chamber and an ampule breaking
mechanism similar to the one described in [27] and de-
ployed in XENON1T at the end of its lifetime [28]. We
refer to Figure 2 for a schematic view.

The fragile ampule is ﬁrmly held in place by
a custom-made holder welded onto a CF-40 blank
mounted on one of the sides of a CF-Tee. By actuating
a guillotine through a vacuum bellow, the neck of the
ampule can be cut oﬀ in vacuum. Opening a valve to the
evacuated mixing volume transfers ∼ 94 % of the argon
through a ﬁlter. After isolating the ampule chamber
again, xenon from a gas bottle can be added until the

tem and the added 37Ar setup (framed with a dashed line).
The gas recirculation path to introduce the source into the
xenon ﬂow is indicated in red.

TPC working pressure of ∼ 2 bar is reached. Bypass-
ing the recirculation ﬂow through the mixing chamber
and integrating the ﬂow, the introduced 37Ar activity
can be estimated. The argon gas of multiple ampules
can be injected by stopping the recirculation, isolating
the TPC and recuperating the xenon/argon mixture
remaining in the gas system into a cold trap cooled
by liquid nitrogen. The gas system can be pumped af-
ter inserting a new ampule from a port on the mixing
chamber (cf. Figure 2). The use of the cold trap en-
sures that the amount of xenon and, hence, the pres-
sure and liquid level remain unchanged during ampule
changes. For the data described in the subsequent sec-
tions, three ampules with an estimated total activity of
2.7 kBq were broken mid-May 2019 to release the acti-
vated argon into the xenon.

4 Data toolkit

4.1 Data acquisition

The signal sizes are energy dependent, thus deploying
diﬀerent calibration sources requires an adjustment of
the settings in the data acquisition (DAQ). The S1 sig-
nals of the 37Ar lines, for instance, are much smaller
than those of the 83mKr lines and can even be missed
by the trigger or absent in the waveform. At the high
end in signal size, the PMT channel could, if not lim-
ited in voltage, saturate the electronics with S2 signals
from 83mKr. Below, we discuss the DAQ settings and
the deployed hardware in detail.

The raw data is digitised by three 8-channel
CAEN V1724 modules connected in daisy chain, each
with a 100 MHz sampling rate (10 ns samples) and
14-bit resolution at 2.25 V dynamic range. The pre-
ampliﬁed SiPM signals are fed directly to the Flash
ADCs. The PMT signal is attenuated by a factor of
10 for the 83mKr data, while not attenuated for 37Ar,
then sent to the digitisers. After passing through a
CAEN 625 fan-in/fan-out module the trigger is gener-
ated by a CAEN N840 leading edge discriminator based
on the PMT signal. For 83mKr, we require the attenu-
ated PMT signal to exceed 2 mV, which corresponds
to a peak with integrated charge of > 15 − 21 PE. For
37Ar, we trigger on 7 mV of the raw PMT signal corre-
sponding to > 4 − 5 PE. Only for the data at 80 V/cm
drift ﬁeld we use 6 mV. The event window for the 83mKr
data was chosen to be 40 µs with 30 µs post-trigger time,
which is suﬃciently large to contain the S2 even for the
lowest ﬁeld of 194 V/cm when triggered on the S1. Trig-
gers on 83mKr S2 signals are expected to be rare and are
removed in the analysis phase to avoid a bias of events
towards the upper half of the TPC. For 37Ar, the event
window was chosen to be 60 µs with the trigger placed
in the middle at 30 µs to contain the entire waveform,
regardless of whether the trigger was issued by an S1
or S2. The maximum drift time at the lowest applied
ﬁeld of 80 V/cm inside the TPC volume is ∼ 22 µs.

Depending on the user settings, entire waveforms
can be written to disk or, to save memory, only the sam-
ples exceeding a certain threshold (henceforth referred
to as “good” as distinguished from “skipped”) by means
of Zero Length Encoding (ZLE), as shown in Figure 3.
The ﬁrst half of the 83mKr data was taken without ZLE
while the rest, including the 37Ar data, was acquired
with ZLE. The ZLE threshold for 83mKr, which only
comes into play if a trigger is issued, was chosen to
be 15 bins (∼ 2.06 mV at ADC input) for the PMT
channel and 10 bins (∼ 1.37 mV at ADC input) for the
SiPM channels. To catch the S1s of 37Ar at the single

PE level, we have chosen 20 bins (∼ 2.75 mV at ADC
input) for the PMT channel and 6 bins (∼ 0.82 mV
at ADC input) for the SiPM channels as ZLE thresh-
olds. These values were determined empirically and, in
the case of 37Ar, set just above the baseline. In addi-
tion to the over-threshold samples, a certain number of
backward- and forward-samples can be speciﬁed to in-
clude the rise and the tail of the peak. To keep timing
information, the counts of good samples and skipped
samples are recorded as so-called control words [29].
We recorded 150 (200) backward-samples and 150 (100)
forward-samples for 83mKr (37Ar).

4.2 Data processing

The data processing consists of three stages. The ﬁrst
is devoted to event alignment and merging of the data
ﬁles from the three ADC modules into one. The second
stage is the main raw data processing of the waveforms
on an event-by-event basis. It retrieves basic informa-
tion about the peaks in the individual channels, identi-
ﬁes pulses as coincidences of these peaks and classiﬁes
their pulse type (S1/S2/noise). The third step is the
post-processing tailored to the analysis phase: events
are built by combining S1s and S2s based on measured
charges and physical drift times. Geometry or drift time
related corrections are applied later in the analysis, as
detailed in Section 5.

4.2.1 Pre-processing

The ﬁrst stage ensures the correct matching of the
events recorded by the three ADC modules by means
of a comparison of the trigger time tag changes among
triggers. Misalignment among the modules can be
caused by an incorrectly propagated busy state. How-
ever, an eﬃcient oﬄine realigning-algorithm typically
restores 99.9 % of the raw events. Once all the events
are aligned, events of one dataset are merged into one
ROOT ﬁle.

4.2.2 Main processing

Prior to the actual processing, in the ZLE case, the
waveforms are reconstructed from the control words.
The second stage starts with the baseline calculation
of the raw waveforms and the inversion of the negative
PMT signal. In the ZLE case, we account for baseline
shifts by calculating the baseline for each good-region
individually, shown in Figure 3. The threshold for peak-
detection (not to be confused with the ZLE threshold
for the DAQ) was chosen to be two standard deviations

5

of the baseline distribution around zero. The peak in-
tegration limits are dynamically deﬁned based on the
variation of the baseline. Integration windows smaller
than 3 samples are discarded for noise suppression.

The processor can, to a certain extent, distinguish
multiple peaks that overlap. This is necessary to resolve
the event topology of 83mKr with two S2 signals arriving
shortly after one another (see Section 5.2) and is helpful
to separate afterpulses from the main peak. To reduce
the sensitivity to random ﬂuctuations, the method re-
quires over-threshold regions of at least 6 samples. We
split two peaks based on their moving average of or-
der of 4 samples (order 2 samples for over-threshold
regions ≤ 25 samples) whenever both have fallen be-
low half of their individual maximum value. Thus, for a
Gaussian-shaped peak almost 90% of its charge is inte-
grated when cut on one side. The moving average limits
the algorithm to a minimum peak separation of 40 ns or
20 ns, respectively. This time-scale is suﬃciently short
to split even close S1 signals eﬃciently and is irrele-
vant for S2 signals for which the requirement of the
contained charge dominates.

After a peak is found, separated from others and
its integration window ﬁxed, the peak properties are
extracted. The area is determined from the summed bin
content of each sample, the peak position is deﬁned as
the position of the maximum sample. We also determine
the width of the peak which serves as discriminator
for the S1 and S2 identiﬁcation. S1 and S2 signals are
distinguished by width-based ﬁlters, where the ﬁlters at
the i-th bin are deﬁned as:

S1i :=

i+ w1
2(cid:88)

j=i− w1
2

Aj

and S2i :=

i+ w2
2(cid:88)

j=i− w2
2

Aj −S1i

. (1)

Aj is the baseline-subtracted signal at the j-th bin and
w1, w2 are the two widths. While a maximum summa-
tion width of w1 = 20 samples contains the entire S1,
w2 was chosen to be maximum 100 samples. The sums
are bounded by the peak integration window to guaran-
tee that it is not summed over a distinct close-by peak.
Both ﬁlters are evaluated at i being the centre of the
full width at half maximum of the peak to account for
their asymmetric shape. The S2 ﬁlter will be zero for
an isolated S1-like signal and much larger for an S2. We
choose the ratio S2/S1 as discriminator and identify a
peak with S2 if this ratio is > 0.2, i.e. if > 20 % more
charge is contained within w2 than within w1. This re-
veals the importance of good S1 splitting as we rely on
the fact that S1s are contained inside w1.

For the event building stage, it is essential to form
physical pulses from the detected peaks. We deﬁne a
pulse as a set of peaks of at least two channels in time

Fig. 3 Recorded SiPM waveform of a 83mKr event acquired with ZLE. For visualisation, we present the relevant region of
the 40 µs DAQ window of an event from a SiPM channel located at an outer corner of the array that exhibits small S2 signals
for events in the horizontal center of the TPC. The peaks are located in two good-regions surrounded by 150 backward- and
forward-samples with skipped-regions in between. The integration windows are shaded and enclosed by lines. The baseline,
from which the threshold is deﬁned, is calculated individually for each good-region. While for disjointed good-regions, like
here, it is based on the ﬁrst half of the backward-samples, for two consecutive good-regions, the baseline is calculated within
the [60, 90] % interval between the two adjacent over-threshold regions. The S2 signals are overlaid with the moving average on
which the splitting algorithm is based. While it splits the two S2s because they have both fallen below half of their individual
maximum value, it is insensitive to the visible ﬂuctuations of the S2 light. The widths w1, w2 used for the ﬁlters are limited
to the integration window and, hence, are equal for the S1 signals. In the zoom, it is visible that over-threshold regions below
3 samples are not integrated.

coincidence. The coincidence window is diﬀerent for S1
and S2 signals and set based on the classiﬁcation of the
PMT peak.

4.2.3 Post-processing

The post-processing script creates high-level variables
based on the described output. It selects the two
highest-charge S1s and S2s of an event with the corre-
sponding peak properties from those pulses in which the
PMT was involved. In addition, it stores the photosen-
sor gains, reconstructs the (x, y)-position of each event
and calculates the drift times from the delay between
the S1 and S2 signals. We require a positive drift time,
i.e. the S1 must happen before the corresponding S2
and their distance must not exceed a maximum value.
To reduce the contribution of high-energetic events and
ensure correct S1/S2 pairing, we remove saturated sig-
nals just below the maximum input voltage of the lim-
iting fan-in/fan-out module of 1.6 V at 11600 ADC bins
or higher. The calculation of higher-level variables and
the conversion from ADC bins to PE are performed at
the analysis stage.

4.3 Photosensor gain calibration

The gain of the photosensors was monitored and cali-
brated about once a week with light from an external
blue LED as described in [15]. The gain values are cal-
culated following the model-independent approach pro-
posed in [30]. For the bottom PMT, the measured gain
during the 37Ar data taking phase is (3.76 ± 0.06) × 106
at an operating voltage of 940 V. The gain of the SiPMs
is found to be uniform across the array and stable dur-
ing the entire data taking. The average gain of the 16
SiPM readout channels over the data-taking period is
(3.12 ± 0.01) × 107 at a bias voltage of 51.5 V includ-
ing the tenfold ampliﬁcation of the pre-ampliﬁer. The
given uncertainties correspond to the standard devia-
tion of the time averaged gains. The stability of the
averaged SiPM gain is shown in Figure 4.

4.4 Position reconstruction and ﬁducial volume

The top photosensor array allows for the reconstruc-
tion of the (x, y)-position of interactions. We use a sim-
ple centre-of-gravity algorithm to determine the (x, y)-

7

because of the solid angle seen by the individual pho-
tosensors. Using a data-driven approach, we correct
for this eﬀect by comparing the positions of the spots
visible in the (x, y)-distribution with the known gate
mesh junctions. In Figure 5, left, we show the (x, y)-
distribution from 37Ar data overlaid by the drawing of
the meshes. The spots occur due to focusing of drifting
electrons to the high-ﬁeld regions around the junctions
of the grounded hexagonal gate mesh. This limits the
accuracy of the (x, y) event position reconstruction to
roughly half the distance between the junctions, which
is ∼ 1.5 mm.

Up to a radius of ∼ 10 mm from the TPC centre, the
correction function is fairly linear, i.e. the correction can
be performed with a scaling factor, whereas for larger
radii it diverges. This can be described by a projection
of a sphere onto a plane as:

dTPC ·

2 − 1

π · arccos
rmap

(cid:17)

map + y2
x2

map is the mapped radius of
where rmap =
the interaction site with rmap,max being the boundary
of the TPC after the mapping and dTPC = 31 mm the
true diameter of the TPC. The linear region of this
projection deﬁnes our radial ﬁducial volume cut to be
r < 10 mm. The z-position of an interaction is obtained
from the time diﬀerence between the S1 and S2 signals.
We extract the electron drift speed for a given electric
ﬁeld from the clearly visible position of the cathode and
the gate in the drift time histogram and their spatial
separation. The procedure, together with a drift speed
measurement at diﬀerent ﬁelds in Xurich II, are de-
tailed in [15]. The drift speeds that we ﬁnd here are in
agreement with this former measurement and are in the
range 1.5 − 2.0 mm/µs.

To avoid high and potentially non-uniform electric
ﬁeld regions around the electrodes, we select only events
within z ∈ [−29, −2] mm, where 0 mm is the position of
the gate and −31 mm is the position of the cathode. The
ﬁducial region deﬁned by these boundaries is shown in
Figure 5 and contains a xenon mass of ∼ 24.5 g.

5 Data analysis

Fig. 4 Error-weighted mean gain (tenfold ampliﬁed) of the
16 SiPM channels over the entire data taking period in 2019.
We measured (3.12 ± 0.01) × 107. The ±1σ and ±2σ uncer-
tainty bands around the mean are shown in red. Data with
83mKr (37Ar) was acquired before (after) the time-axis break.

position of an event from the light distribution among
the photosensors caused by the largest S2 signal. We
denote the physical position of the i-th SiPM in the ar-
ray by (X, Y )i, with the origin of the coordinate system
being the centre-of-gravity of the array. We then obtain
the (uncorrected) event position in x from a geometry-
and gain-weighted sum of the integrated S2 charge of
each sensor1,

where the normalisation Qtot
S2/gi is the to-
tal collected S2 charge in the top array with the gain gi
of the i-th SiPM channel. While this approach neglects
the fact that the light intensity follows an inverse-square
law with the distance from the light production site, we
ﬁnd that the algorithm is an adequate choice for our
small-scale TPC and leads to excellent reconstruction
in the TPC centre. Because of the square arrangement
of the SiPMs and the nature of the centre-of-gravity ap-
proach, the resulting positions will not represent the ac-
tual circular cross-section of the TPC. In fact, while the
reconstruction in the TPC centre is very good, events
at the TPC boundary feature a square-shaped bias. For
this reason, the square is scaled down to unit side length
with a constant, xscal = x/c, and then mapped onto a
unit circle that is scaled back,

While these mapped positions are centred around the
origin of the coordinate system due to the gain cor-
rection in Equation 2, they still feature a radial bias

1The reconstruction is performed analogously for the y-
position.

In this section, we describe the data selection, the ap-
plied quality cuts and the signal corrections. We require
correctly paired S1 and S2 events for both calibration
sources. The focus is on the 37Ar source, since it is a
rather new approach to calibrate the low-energy region,
while calibrations with 83mKr are well established. In
this work, we show 37Ar data from the K-shell capture,
with a line at 2.82 keV only.

5.1 Energy calibration with 37Ar

5.1.1 Data selection and quality cuts

The data used for the calibration was taken between
late-May and early-July 2019 while the campaign for
the half-life measurement lasted until mid-October
2019.

As described at the end of Section 4.2, the post-
processing accounts for physical drift times and removes
saturated signals. Because of the low 37Ar signal rate in
the detector volume, O(10 Hz), we expect a negligible
pile-up rate for a DAQ window of 60 µs. This includes
pile-up with background events with a rate of the same
order of magnitude. Furthermore, we select only single
S2s, for we do not expect multiple scatters from a sin-
gle 37Ar decay. To ensure correct S1 and S2 matching,
we require the S2 signal to contain more charge than
the S1. In addition, we apply the ﬁducial volume cut
described in Section 4.4 to remove wall and gas events,
regions with an inhomogeneous electric ﬁeld, and those
outside of the linear region of the (x, y)-position recon-
struction algorithm. To eﬃciently remove events in the
gas phase that yield a large S2 in the top array com-
pared to the total S2, we apply a so-called area fraction
top cut shown in Figure 6, left. To remove the lower
energy lines from the analysis, we apply a cut on the
energy, namely in the centre of the 5σ boundaries of the
L-and the K-shell populations in the total S1+S2 space.
Since accidental coincidences have by deﬁnition a ran-

dom drift time, they can be eﬃciently removed with a
cut on a variable with a strong drift time dependence.
The longitudinal diﬀusion of the electron cloud during
the drift leads to such a dependence of the S2 width, as
shown in Figure 6, right. This distribution follows an
empirical function with three parameters:

S2width(tdrift) = P0 + P1 · tdrift +

(cid:112)

P2 · tdrift

.

(5)

Here, the width corresponds to the full width at tenth
maximum. The upper and lower cuts are deﬁned as fol-
lows: the histogram is sliced in drift time bins, and the
ﬁt is performed through the 97.7 % and 2.3 % quantiles
of those bins. We thus select the ±2σ region around the
mean. For 37Ar data, 5.6 % of the recorded events that
generate an S2 signal pass all data quality cuts.

5.1.2 Corrections

As a result of the recombination of the drifting free
electrons with electronegative impurities in LXe, the
S2 charge degrades with drift time. The free electron
lifetime τe, deﬁned as the decay constant in an expo-
nential decay law, is a measure of the LXe purity. Being
a property of the LXe, the drift time dependence of the
S2 signal of any channel can be used to correct for this
systematic eﬀect. We base our correction on the bottom
PMT as it collects more S2 light than the top array. To
this end, we ﬁt the 50 % quantiles of the 2-dimensional

9

(a) Area fraction top cut to remove gas events with a
fraction of 0.3−0.5 . Besides the K-shell population on the
right we also select parts of the L-shell population below
600 PE S2b and the single photoelectron region that are
both mostly located in S2-only space. These are removed
by an energy cut.

(b) S2 width cut to remove accidental coincidences and
remaining gas events (see text). The drift region deﬁned

S2b2 versus drift time histogram with an exponentially
decreasing function (see Figure 7, left). We thus obtain
the corrected S2 charge by multiplying with its inverse,
i.e. we scale according to the S2 at zero drift time:

cS2 = S2 · exp (tdrift/τe)

.

(6)

The stable detector conditions during the time in which
the calibration data was taken resulted in an electron
lifetime of 85 − 187 µs without showing any abrupt
changes. While we correct for the electron lifetime on a
daily basis, in Figure 7, left, we show for simplicity the
combined data at 968 V/cm drift ﬁeld with an averaged
electron life time. The LCE depends on the geometry
and the optical properties of the TPC. In particular, the
collected S1 light varies with the depth of the event. We
use a data-driven approach and ﬁt the 50 % quantiles of
the 2-dimensional S1b versus drift time histogram with
a 4th order polynomial, as shown in Figure 7, right.
The corrected signal cS1b is obtained by scaling around
the drift time corresponding to the centre of the TPC.
Thanks to the excellent single photoelectron resolution
of SiPMs, the S1t histogram features a band-like struc-
ture, as visible in Figure 8. Since the small light sig-
nal seen by the SiPMs does not show any drift time
dependency within a single band, no data-based drift-
time dependent correction could be performed for S1t.
Because of this discreteness, we would need to know
which events changed to the next lower band after a
certain drift time. However, these bands help us to ﬁx
the charge scale in PE. To that end, Gaussian ﬁts on

the seven lowest bands are performed in the S1t his-
togram and then linearly mapped onto the expected
charge in PE. Figure 8 shows the corrected result. All
the described corrections are performed on data within
the ﬁducial volume only. For simplicity, we do not apply
(x, y)-dependent corrections.

5.2 Energy calibration with 83mKr

A common technique for the energy calibration of a
xenon dual-phase TPC is to introduce 83mKr into the
system [4, 31–33]. This source with T1/2 = 1.83(2) h
oﬀers a homogeneous distribution of events in the target
volume with a line at 32.15 keV followed by a line at
9.41 keV with T1/2 = 155.1(12) ns for the intermediate
state [16].

5.2.1 Data selection and quality cuts

The selection of 83mKr events is performed by exploit-
ing the double-S1 and double-S2 signal topology as a
result of the intermediate 9.41 keV level. In the follow-
ing, we only consider split S1 and S2-pairs and not the
combined 41.56 keV line. That is, in the PMT channel,
we require exactly two S1s with S2s and the S1s must
contain less charge than their paired S2s. In a next step,
a cut on the delay time of the PMT signals is applied.
We expect 83mKr events to have the same positive de-
lay ∆t between the two S1 signals as between the two
S2 signals and select ±2σ around the centred mean in
the ∆tS1 − ∆tS2 histogram. As for 37Ar, we use the
ﬁducial volume cut from Section 4.4, an area fraction

6 Results and Discussion

After applying the described corrections, we show in
Figure 9 the localised populations from the 2.82 keV
line of 37Ar (left) together with the two lines of 83mKr
(right) in total S2 versus total S1 space. The anti-
correlation between ionisation and scintillation signals
is evident, however less pronounced at the low energy
of 37Ar due to the small S1 signals.

From the mean of the 37Ar distribution, we de-
duce a light yield of (4.985 ± 0.003) PE/keV and a
charge yield of (1504.0 ± 0.2) PE/keV for 2.82 keV at
968 V/cm drift ﬁeld. For 83mKr, at the same drift ﬁeld,
we obtain a light yield of (7.941 ± 0.003) PE/keV and
a charge yield of (702.0 ± 0.3) PE/keV at 9.4 keV, and
(6.284 ± 0.002) PE/keV and (1080.1 ± 0.3) PE/keV, re-
spectively at 32.1 keV. The uncertainties reﬂect the sta-
tistical errors on the mean of the yields. The discus-
sion of the systematics, in particular the limitation of
the 83mKr charge yield precision, follows below. In Fig-
ure 10, we present the 2.82 keV population of 37Ar for
the S2 light of the top array only. From the comparison
with Figure 9 (left), we deduce that 23.5% of the total
detected S2 light is collected by the SiPMs.

Calculating the total

light and charge yield for
data at diﬀerent drift ﬁelds yields the so-called Doke
plot [34], shown in Figure 11. The light and charge yield
measurements of the three lines from 37Ar and 83mKr
feature a clear anti-correlated linear dependence. The
37Ar points are less spread than those from 83mKr be-
cause the drift ﬁeld dependence of the ionisation and
scintillation yield decreases rapidly below ∼ 10 keV ER
energy [35]. The errors include statistical uncertainties,

gle photoelectron band structure.

top cut, an energy cut to separate the lines, as well as
the S2 width cut. For 83mKr data, 1.9 % of the recorded
events that generate an S2 signal pass all data quality
cuts.

5.2.2 Corrections

We apply the same corrections on the 83mKr lines as
described above for 37Ar. Due to the higher energy of
the source, and thus the higher S1 signal seen by the
top SiPMs, we are able to correct S1t with a 4th or-
der polynomial showing qualitatively the opposite drift
time dependency compared to the S1b signal (cf. Fig-
ure 7, right).

as well as systematic uncertainties of the PMT gain and
of the peak-splitting method described in Section 4.2.
The condition on the contained charge explains the
systematic bias of the 32.15 keV points towards lower
charge yield and is the origin of the asymmetric verti-
cal error bars assigned to 83mKr. However, this is not
relevant for the light yield as the S1 delay time is suﬃ-
ciently long to provide complete S1 separation for any
split S2 signal.

The detector-speciﬁc gains g1 and g2 are deﬁned as

g1 := S1/Nγ

and g2 := S2/Ne−

,

where Nγ is the total number of photons produced
by de-excitation or recombination and Ne− is the to-
tal number of electrons producing the S2 signal. With

nals at diﬀerent drift ﬁelds in the range 80 − 968 V/cm for

intersections yield the detector-speciﬁc gains g1 and g2 from

where we substituted the number of quanta for the
deﬁnitions in Equation 7. From the axis intersections
of the linear regression in Figure 11, we obtain g1 =
(0.150 ± 0.014) PE/γ and g2 = (36.9 ± 2.1) PE/e−. The
combined energy resolution σ/E from S1 and S2 signals
of the 2.82 keV 37Ar line is (17.2 ± 0.1) % at 968 V/cm
and stays constant down to 600 V/cm. Below this value,
the resolution degrades slowly to (18.0 ± 0.1) % at the

12

lowest measured ﬁeld. The resolution at the highest
energy of 32.15 keV is (5.80 ± 0.01) % which is con-
sistent with the one we previously measured with the
TPC with two PMTs [15]. The yields of all lines at
968 V/cm are compared to the Noble Element Simula-
tion Technique (NEST) v2.0 [37] model predictions in
Figure 12. Both charge and light yield at 2.82 keV and
32.15 keV agree well with the gamma model. In addi-
tion, we show the predictions for the two lines of 83mKr.
While we see good agreement at 32.15 keV, we ﬁnd a
lower charge yield than predicted at 9.41 keV. Due to
anti-correlation, the light yield at the latter energy is
higher than predicted but consistent with NEST v2.0
83mKr within the error.

Fig. 12 Comparison of the obtained charge (blue) and light
(red) yields from 37Ar and 83mKr lines at 968 V/cm to the
NEST v2.0 gamma and 83mKr model. The uncertainty bands
reﬂect the intrinsic systematics of the gamma model.

Data with the 37Ar source was acquired over a pe-
riod of more than 4 half-lives. Selecting the data as
described in Section 5 in daily slices, we show in Fig-
ure 13 the evolution of the activity of the 2.82 keV
line. For simplicity, we assume that all the systemat-
ics and applied cuts are stable over the time of the
measurement. The exponential ﬁt yields a half-life of
(35.7 ± 0.4) d, where the most recent literature value is
(35.011 ± 0.019) d from a weighted average of four mea-
surements [18]. The given error is the error of the decay
parameter of the least squares ﬁt and does not include
systematic uncertainties. However, within the scope of
this work, we can be conﬁdent that we indeed selected
events from 37Ar decays.

For 83mKr, exponential ﬁts of the S1 and S2 delay
histograms yield (161 ± 5) ns for the half-life of the in-
termediate state, in agreement with the literature value
stated in Section 5.2.

37Ar over more than 4 half-lives with a one-day binning start-
ing from the time at which the ﬁrst ampule was broken. The
ﬁt was performed on 968 V/cm data only, because at other
drift ﬁelds the data features systematic deviations caused by
the varying eﬃciency of the applied data-driven cuts and cor-
rections. The errors on the individual data points are Poisson-
like. We obtain a half-life of (35.7 ± 0.4) d.

7 Summary

In this work, we have presented for the ﬁrst time a dual-
phase xenon TPC equipped with SiPMs in the top pho-
tosensor array. We operated the detector under stable
conditions for more than one year and have demon-
strated its performance with data from internal 83mKr
and 37Ar calibration sources. Based on the centre of
gravity of ionisation signals detected by the SiPM top
array, we have reconstructed the (x, y)-position with
a resolution of 1.5 mm within the ﬁducial radius. The
low energy threshold of the detector and its energy
resolution have allowed for an S1 and S2 analysis of
the 2.82 keV line of 37Ar. The light and charge yields
were compared with NEST v2.0 predictions, and pro-
vide valuable input for the software. Ongoing studies in-
clude an S2-only analysis of the clearly visible 0.27 keV
line and an attempt to look for the lower energetic M-
shell capture at 17.5 eV. Our study has demonstrated
that SiPMs are indeed a promising alternative to PMTs
in small detectors. The scaleability to much larger ar-
rays, such as required by the DARWIN multi-ton liq-
uid xenon detector [11] is under investigation. A ma-
jor challenge, apart from reducing the dark count rate,
is the readout and the signal pre-ampliﬁcation. The
main shortcoming of the described ampliﬁer board for
16 channels is its heat dissipation of ∼ 3 W. To that
end, we are currently investigating the lowest allowable
pre-ampliﬁcation factor and testing various low-power
pre-ampliﬁers at cryogenic temperatures.
