ABSTRACT

Aims. We study the impact of Post-Newtonian correction terms on the energetic interaction between a gravitational wave (GW)-
emitting supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary system and incoming stars via three-body scattering experiments.
Methods. We use the AR-chain code to simulate with high accuracy the interactions between stars and an SMBH binary at separations
of ∼ 1000 Rsch. For all of the interactions, we investigate in detail the energy balance of the three-body systems, using both Newtonian
and Post-Newtonian expressions for the SMBH binary orbital energy, taking into account the GW emission by the binary.
Results. We ﬁnd that at these separations, purely Newtonian treatment of the binary orbital energy is insuﬃcient to properly account
for the SMBH binary orbital evolution. Instead, along with GW emission, even terms in the PN-corrections must be included in order
to describe the energy change of the binary during the stellar interaction.

1. Introduction

Supermassive black hole (hereafter SMBH) mergers are promis-
ing candidates for gravitational wave (GW) detections with the
LISA mission (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017) and the pulsar timing
arrays (Reardon et al. 2016; Desvignes et al. 2016; Arzouma-
nian et al. 2016; Verbiest et al. 2016). It is expected that fol-
lowing galactic mergers, the SMBHs which reside in the cen-
ter of each galaxy form binary systems which would eventually
coalesce, emitting a burst of GWs. Begelman et al. (1980) fa-
mously described the three main phases of an SMBH merger.
In the ﬁrst phase, dynamical friction drives the evolution of the
binary, bringing it close enough to form a binary system. In the
second phase, known as the hardening phase, the SMBH sepa-
ration is at parsec scales. At these separations, dynamical fric-
tion is no longer eﬀective and instead individual three-body in-
teractions of stars with the SMBH binary drive its evolution in
a process known as stellar hardening (Yu 2002). Finally, when
the binary separation is at milliparsec scales, GW emission ef-
fectively carries away energy and angular momentum from the
binary, bringing it to coalescence.

During the hardening phase of a SMBH binary merger, the
main mechanism of energy loss for the binary is via energetic
stellar interactions, during which incoming stars on radial orbits
are able to extract energy from the binary with the gravitational
slingshot eﬀect. In order for the energy extracted from the bi-
nary to be signiﬁcant enough to measurably contribute to the
hardening, the star needs to experience very close interactions
with the binary (with the closest approach distance on the order
of the binary semi-major axis, rp (cid:46) 3abh, Yu (2002)). The proper
treatment of this physical process in simulations is of crucial im-

portance since this is the primary method of bringing the black
holes close enough in order to reach coalescence. However, it
may be problematic and cumbersome to include in galactic-scale
simulations, due to the very high spatial resolution which is nec-
essary to properly resolve all of the close interactions (compared
to galactic scales which are orders of magnitude larger). There-
fore, treatment of these interactions with direct integration might
be out of reach for studies that do not have access to large and
eﬃcient computational resources. Instead, they may use semi-
analytical estimates of hardening rates which can then be used to
model the evolution of SMBH binaries without actually resolv-
ing the encounters themselves (see e.g. Sesana & Khan 2015).

On the other hand, direct N-body codes are able to calculate
forces during the encounters up to a high degree of accuracy,
but are often unable to accurately analyze the individual encoun-
ters between the stellar and BH particles, due to resolution con-
straints and exceptionally high computational cost. Therefore,
they are usually unable to give precise estimates of the speciﬁc
energy changes in a single encounter, instead focusing on cumu-
lative eﬀects from many interactions.

Instead, 3-body scattering experiments provide a computa-
tionally eﬃcient way to study the nature of these interactions in a
multitude of diﬀerent conﬁgurations and scenarios and to inves-
tigate these eﬀects for diﬀerent masses of the binary members
and orbital conﬁgurations (e.g., Bonetti et al. 2020; Rasskazov
& Kocsis 2019; Sesana et al. 2008, 2006; Quinlan 1996). They
can be especially useful as a precursor to N-body runs, as a way
to gain insight into the cumulative, as well as average energy
changes from stellar encounters, without the presence of other
physical eﬀects from the galactic environment which may af-
fect the result, such as gravitational torques from overdensities

in the distribution, two-body relaxation eﬀects and the gravita-
tional impact of the system itself.

In numerical simulations, the GW emission of the binary, as
well as other relativistic eﬀects are reproduced by adding Post-
Newtonian (PN) corrections up to a certain order to the binary
equations of motion (see Blanchet 2014; Will 2011, for reviews
on the topic). While this approach is standard practice, it is still
not fully understood if the introduction of Post-Newtonian terms
in the equations of motion will aﬀect the star-binary energy ex-
change, and if so, if the eﬀect would be measurable. This is es-
pecially interesting to consider during the phase of the merger
when gravitational wave emission becomes comparable to the
binding energy gained from stellar interactions. During this tran-
sitional period, both stellar hardening and PN terms induce secu-
lar, as well as periodic changes in the orbital motion of the binary
and the interplay between these two eﬀects in N-body studies has
not yet been thoroughly explored in the literature.

Therefore, in this work we present the results of a number of
three-body scattering experiments, performed using the highly
accurate AR-chain integration method (Mikkola & Merritt 2006,
2008). The goal of these experiments was to provide valuable
insight into the energy exchange at a time when the PN eﬀects
are non-negligible, enabling an overview of dominant terms in
the energy balance when the binary is at ∼ 1000 Rsch separations
(Rsch is the Schwarzschild radius of the combined mass m =
m1 + m2 of the SMBH binary).

The text is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the
simulation parameters and describe the inital setup of the code.
Section 3 contains our results. Speciﬁcally, in Section 3.1 we
brieﬂy describe the merger rate detected in the runs. In Section
3.2 we present our main ﬁndings and discuss the relevance of
PN terms in this phase of the merger. In Section 4 we summarize
and discuss our ﬁndings. Finally, in Appendix A, we present the
derivation of the condition employed for the initial velocity of
the stellar particles.

2. Numerical description, initial conditions and

setup

The three-body simulations were performed with the regularized
AR-chain code (Mikkola & Merritt 2006, 2008), featuring two
SMBH particles and a single stellar particle. The code includes
PN corrections to the equations of motion up to order 2.5PN, in
order to account for GW emission. Each simulation run consists
of three particles, two SMBH particles situated near the centre
of mass of the system and a stellar particle, starting as a dis-
tant third body. Since the interactions between the particles are
regularized to avoid singularities when R → 0, we used no grav-
itational softening between the star and the black holes, as well
as between the black holes themselves, allowing for arbitrarily
close approaches.

The masses, positions and velocities of the black holes were
obtained using the system from Khan et al. (2016) at diﬀerent
times of the original simulation. In that work, a massive galaxy
merger at redshift z ∼ 3.5 was identiﬁed and followed using the
Argo cosmological simulation (Feldmann & Mayer 2015; Fiac-
coni et al. 2015). At a time which we refer to as the initial time
tini, a static particle-splitting procedure was performed in order
to increase the particle number, and two SMBH particles with
masses m1 = 3 × 108M(cid:12) and m2 = 8 × 107M(cid:12) were introduced
at the local minima of the gravitational potential of the galactic
cores. The system was evolved further using the GASOLINE
code (Wadsley et al. 2004) and during the ﬁnal stages of the

merger, the galaxy merger remnant had a gas fraction of only
5%. At time tPN = tini + 21.5 Myr, the remaining gas particles
were turned into star particles, a spherical region of 5 kpc around
the most massive SMBH was extracted, the softening was fur-
ther reduced, and the PN terms were turned on. At this stage, the
separation between the black holes was ∼ 300 pc. This system
was then further evolved using the direct N-body code ϕ-GPU
(Berczik et al. 2011). Integration was continued until the merger
of the SMBH particles was induced by the PN corrections (up
to order 3.5) in the equations of motion. For more details on the
simulation setup, we refer the reader to Khan et al. (2016). For
more details on the properties of the system, we refer the reader
to Avramov et al. (2021).

For the scattering simulations we used the same N-body units
as in the original simulation (see Table 1 for the parameters).
We performed two diﬀerent sets of scattering experiments, cor-
responding to diﬀerent times of the original N-body run. The
ﬁrst set of runs is initialized when the binary semi-major axis is
a0 = 4.6 × 10−2 pc, corresponding to a separation of 1277 Rsch.
This separation corresponds to time t1 = tPN + 7.75 Myr of the
original run. At this point in time, we expect the gravitational
wave emission to be measurable, but not dominant with respect
to stellar hardening. The second set of runs is initialized when
the binary semi-major axis is a0 = 3.15 × 10−2 pc, correspond-
ing to a separation of 874 Rsch and time t2 = tPN + 9.3 Myr in
the original run. At this point in time we expect gravitational
wave emission to be dominant with respect to stellar hardening.
The stellar particle is assigned a mass several orders of magni-
tude smaller than the mass of the less massive black hole, and
is positioned at a large initial distance from the binary system
D0 = 100 pc. Every stellar particle is assigned the same mass
value of 91, 800 M(cid:12).

A simulation run is ended if the stellar particle becomes un-
bound. A stellar particle is considered unbound if its total energy
becomes positive, E∗ > 0, and if it reaches a distance R > 2D0
from the center of mass. Both of these conditions need to be
met in order to stop the run. Otherwise, a run is stopped if the
star does not experience large energy changes over a suﬃciently
large timescale at tmax, or if there is a merger event between the
star particle and the black hole binary. After each encounter, the
system is reset, the binary is given the same initial conditions
and orbital parameters as before, and the next stellar particle is
generated.

The initial conditions for stellar particles are calculated in
such a way so that the stellar particles are distributed spherically-
symmetric around the SMBH binary. Using standard random
number generation, stars are distributed evenly in space on a
spherical shell surrounding the binary with a radius R = D0. For
the initial velocities, a unit vector is drawn from an isotropic dis-
tribution, which determines the angle α between the radius vec-
tor and the velocity vector of the stellar particle. In order to make
sure that our encounters experience strong interactions with the
black hole binary, we need to carefully choose the magnitude
of the initial velocity of the stellar particles. We are interested in
particles which have closest approaches comparable to the initial
semi-major axis a0 of the binary:

rp < 2a0,

(1)

where rp is the pericenter distance in the two-body Keplerian
approximation of the star-SMBH binary system. From this con-
dition, we can obtain an equivalent condition for the velocity am-
plitude Vi of the stellar particle in terms of the escape velocity
of the star Vesc =

The full derivation of this condition is given in Appendix A. The

The ﬁrst set of runs, corresponding to initial time t1, con-
sisted of 1000 scattering experiments with output generated at a
timestep of ∆t = 1550 yr. The second set of runs consisted of
2000 encounters in total, and the output frequency was lowered
since snapshots were generated at the timestep of ∆t = 15500 yr.
The sample size for the second set of runs was increased by a
factor of two in order to investigate if the results are aﬀected by
the low number statistics. It is important to note that the output
frequency for both sets of runs is several orders of magnitude
lower than the output frequency needed to actually resolve the
orbit of the binary, which has an initial period P0 of 50 yr and
27 yr, respectively (see Table 1). This means that while the time
resolution of the output data is signiﬁcantly increased with re-
spect to the original study, it is still insuﬃcient to resolve the
energetic encounter itself during post-processing.

3. Results

3.1. Merger rate

Previously described parameter values are set up in such a way
that is expected to be ideal for highly eﬀective energy exchange
between the stellar and SMBH particles. This is in large part due
to the fact that the initial velocity condition given by Eq. 2 guar-
antees close approaches to the binary. Normally, the value of the
softening determines the closest possible approach between the
particles. Since the softening in the AR-chain is set to zero for
all particles, this artiﬁcial limit is not present and allows for arbi-
trarily close interactions between all particles. However, this can
also lead to merger events, which should be excluded from any
energy exchange analysis. An interaction between a stellar and
black hole particle is registered as a merger when their separation
becomes smaller than four times the Schwarzschild radius of the
black hole involved in the interaction. The merger rates obtained
from the simulations for the cases of t1 and t2 are 2.01% and 2%,
respectively. These events are therefore excluded from further
analysis, since in reality they would result in direct plunges of
stars into one of the black holes.

3.2. Energy balance

In this section, we will analyze in detail the energy balance of
the system by examining the diﬀerent energy terms which con-
stitute the total energy of the three-body system for each run and
investigate the impact of PN terms to the results.

The equations of motion of the two black hole particles have
been corrected for Post-Newtonian eﬀects up to order 2.5PN, ac-
cording to the formulas found in Blanchet & Iyer (2003). How-
ever, it is important to note that the treatment of stellar parti-
cles remains strictly Newtonian. The only dissipative term in the
equations of motion of the black holes is the 2.5PN term, corre-
sponding to the GW radiation-reaction term (Peters & Mathews
1963; Peters 1964), while the other PN terms (namely 1PN and
2PN) are conservative and maintain the conservation of energy
of the SMBH binary. The simulation employs black holes with-
out spin, so the 1.5PN term is equal to zero. Because of this, we

expect the 2.5PN term to be the only one to eﬀectively take away
net energy from the system.

The relative energy error of our simulation runs is in the
range of 10−13–10−9, several orders of magnitude smaller than
the values of the energy components of the system. Therefore,
we expect that when corrected for the 2.5PN term, the total en-
ergy of the simulated 3-body system is conserved to a high de-
gree, and the energy exchange is well resolved. Let us now pro-
vide an overview of all the energy components. We will assume
the binary center of mass is at rest at the origin and treat the
binary as a single massive body when computing the potential
exerted by the binary on the star. These are justiﬁed approxima-
tions, since the initial (D0) and ﬁnal distance of the star (> 2D0)
is much larger than the binary orbital separation, and the mass of
the stellar particle is more than 4000 times smaller than the mass
of the SMBH binary.

Without taking into account non-dissipative PN terms, the
energy change (ﬁnal – initial values) of the black holes is given
by

−∆ENewt = ∆E∗ + EGW,

(3)

where EBH = ENewt is the total Newtonian energy of the bi-
nary deﬁned as the sum of its potential and kinetic energy, E∗
is the total energy of the star and EGW = ∆E2.5PN is the energy
emitted by gravitational radiation during the simulation. Equa-
tion 3 tells us that we expect that the binding energy change of
the binary corresponds to a high degree of accuracy to the sum
of the energy change of the star particle and the energy emit-
ted by gravitational radiation. The instantaneous energy emitted
via gravitational waves EGW corresponds to the time derivative
of the radiation-reaction term and is calculated using the energy
balance correction in the quadrupole approximation (Blanchet &
Iyer 2003)

v2,

(4)

where µ is the reduced binary mass µ = (m1m2)/(m1 + m2),
r and v are the relative distance and velocity of the SMBHs.
The corresponding GW emission is then cross-checked with the
orbit-averaged formulas from Peters & Mathews (1963); Peters
(1964).

The left panels of Fig. 1 show the energy balance of all en-
counters according to Eq. 3 for the two sets of simulations. The
black line corresponds to an ideal situation with no missing en-
ergy, when the energy change of the binary is exactly equal to the
stellar energy changes. The color coding corresponds to Newto-
nian orbital eccentricity changes of the SMBH binary, calculated
using the Runge-Lenz vector. If Eq. 3 can be used, all points
should fall onto the one-to-one black line. However, the plots
show that there is an energy discrepancy for each individual run,
as shown by the vertical distance of the points from the black
line. The color coding shows that the value of the energy dis-
crepancy is correlated to the eccentricity change of the binary.
Positive changes in eccentricity lead mostly to a negative dis-
crepancy in the energy balance, and vice-versa.

The same energy discrepancy is noticeable when looking at
the cumulatively summed terms of all of the interactions. An
overview of the cumulatively summed diﬀerent energy terms for
both sets of simulation runs can be seen in Figure 2 (left pan-
els), as a function of speciﬁc energy change of the stars. If Eq.
3 is satisﬁed, the blue and dashed magenta line, as well as the

red and green, dashed lines should match to a very high degree
of accuracy. Then, we would expect that the energy diﬀerence
between all terms (gray dash-dotted line) remains at zero at all
energies. However, we notice from the ﬁgure that this is not the
case. In both simulation sets, there is a non-negligible energy
discrepancy denoted by the gray dash-dotted line, which repre-
sents energy not accounted for by the energy balance equation.
In the case of t1, the cumulative sum of the energy discrepancies
is positive, while when t2 the summed energy discrepancies are
negative. This energy discrepancy is at the same order of mag-
nitude as the other energy terms and therefore not negligible. As
previously noted, the energy error of the simulation is a few or-
ders of magnitude smaller than any value of the energy terms,
and therefore cannot be responsible for the energy discrepancy.

3.3. Post-Newtonian energy correction

The presence of the energy discrepancy points to the fact that
strictly Newtonian deﬁnitions of the binary orbital energy may
be insuﬃcient to account for the energy evolution of the system.
As previously described, the even PN terms are non-dissipative
and we did not previously include them in the equation denoting
the energy changes (Eq. 3), since they do not carry away energy
from the system. Instead, the 1PN and 2PN terms are connected
to correction terms for the energy of the binary. For eccentric
orbits they depend on the orbital phase of the binary, which leads
to a dominating oscillatory contribution when calculating energy
diﬀerences (before and after the interaction). The long-term drift
due to these terms is much smaller, leading to corrections of the
order of ∼ Rsch/r.

If the equations of motion are corrected up to the 2PN term,
the energy of the binary EBH is fully conserved. However, since
the equations of motion also include the dissipative 2.5PN term,
this energy is conserved only in the sense that its time deriva-
tive computed through the fully PN-corrected equations of mo-
tion is exactly equal to the eﬀect of the 2.5PN term (Blanchet &
Iyer 2003). This leads to the ﬁnal expression for stellar energy
change:
∆E∗ = −∆ENewt − ∆E1PN − EGW.

On the right side of Fig. 1 we present again the energy changes
after the run, but using the updated energy balance equation Eq.
7. We immediately notice that the energy discrepancies seen in
the left side of the plot come from omitting the E1PN correction
term, and after the correction we obtain much better energy con-
servation, with all points falling almost exactly on the black line.
At the later time, there are still small discrepancies for some en-
counters visible, which would disappear, when the 2PN correc-
tions are also taken into account.

On the right side of Fig. 2 we can see the updated cumula-
tive energy term plots which include the correction for the lead-
ing order 1PN energy term to the energy balance. The ﬁrst order
correction is clearly suﬃcient to successfully resolve the energy
discrepancy for t1 when the separation between the black holes is
≈ 1300 Rsch. This is shown by the gray dash-dotted line which is
now consistently at zero for all encounters, proving that Eq. 7 is
suﬃcient to properly account for all of the energy changes in the
runs. At the later time t2 with a binary separation of ≈ 900 Rsch
the contribution of the 2PN term to the energy of the binary starts
to be visible. We can conclude that the energy discrepancy is re-
solved by the inclusion of the PN correction to the orbital energy
relation of the binary. When the separation between the black
holes exceeds 1000 Rsch, the leading 1PN corrections are suﬃ-
cient for our SMBH binary case. Below this separation the con-
tribution of the 2PN energy correction term also need to be taken
into account to derive the binary orbital energy changes.

4. Summary and conclusions

In this work we have described two sets of three-body simula-
tions that were performed using the highly accurate AR-chain
regularization integration method (Mikkola & Merritt 2006,
2008). The goal of the simulations was to explore the interaction
and study the energy exchange between a stellar particle and an
SMBH binary in the ﬁnal phase of the merger with the star act-
ing as an incoming third body. More speciﬁcally, we aimed to
analyze the energy balance of individual interactions and inves-
tigate the eﬀect of Post-Newtonian terms on the binary evolution
when the semi-major axis of the black hole orbit is ≈ 1300Rsch
in the case of the ﬁrst set, and when the separation is ≈ 900Rsch,
in the case of the second simulation set.

The energy balance analysis showed that there is a signiﬁcant
error in the energy balance of the system when the Newtonian
deﬁnition of binary orbital energy is used. The detected energy
discrepancy was comparable to the other energy changes of the
system and was orders of magnitude larger than the energy er-
ror of the code. The introduction of the 1PN term to the energy
deﬁnition has proven suﬃcient to account for all energy discrep-
ancies for separations larger than 1000Rsch. For this reason, the
orbital energy of the binary must be modiﬁed by at least the lead-
ing PN order to properly account for all energy changes in the
system. The Newtonian approximation is shown to fail even in

Avramov et al.: Impact of Post-Newtonian eﬀects on massive black hole binary evolution

the regime when GW emission is not the dominant eﬀect driving
the binary evolution. Alternatively, a quasi-Keplerian deﬁnition
of orbital elements can be used to avoid the issue. The 1PN term
(Eq. 5), while not eﬀectively carrying away energy from the sys-
tem, does produce variations in the energy and the binary orbital
parameters. The oscillations of the PN correction terms during
the periodical motion of the SMBHs depend on the mass ratio
and the eccentricity. Fig. 1 shows that the sign of the 1PN en-
ergy term is correlated with the Newtonian eccentricity change
of the SMBH binary orbit. This is likely correlated to the fact
that while PN dynamics admit the conservation of angular mo-
mentum, the magnitude of the vector r×u is no longer conserved
(Will 2011), resulting in the observed changes in the eccentricity.

In the ﬁrst step we draw the angle α from an isotropic distri-
bution by deﬁning a unit vector for the velocity. We generate a
randomly oriented normalized velocity vector ˆu to ﬁnd the carte-
sian components:

vx = vt cos(φ),
vy = vt sin(φ),
vz = R3,

(A.9)
(A.10)

where R3 ∈ [−1, +1] is a randomly generated number. The

quantities vt and φ were calculated using

(A.14)

With the angle α calculated, we can substitute the above re-
lation in Eq. A.7 in order to obtain Vmax. Then, we choose a ran-
dom value R5 ∈ [0, +1] to calculate Vi = R5 Vmax and multiply
the obtained velocity amplitude with the already generated unit
velocity vector ˆu

Vi = ±Vi ˆu.

(A.15)

The sign is chosen such that the star is moving towards the
SMBH binary in order to save computation time.

Appendix A: Initial velocity condition

The closest approach of the stellar particle to the binary (its peri-
center distance rp) depends on its initial velocity amplitude Vi.
Therefore, in order to make sure that our encounters experience
strong interactions with the black hole binary, we need to care-
fully choose the initial velocity of the stellar particles. We are
interested in the particles which have closest approaches compa-
rable to the initial semi-major axis of the binary:

rp < 2a0.

(A.1)

Since the SMBH binary is usually deeply embedded in the
galaxy, we are interested in a large range of initial velocities of
the stars exceeding the escape velocity of the isolated SMBH
binary. We do not start with a physical distribution function, but
use a simpliﬁed model instead.

Since the stellar particle starts at a large distance compared
to the separation of the SMBH binary and we are only interested
in a rough estimate of the pericenter distance, we replace the
binary by a single object with mass m at the centre of mass posi-
tion. With the standard procedure for a two-body system, we can
use energy and angular momentum conservation of the relative
motion of a particle with reduced mass µ in a ﬁxed point-mass
potential of the total mass M = m + m∗. Speciﬁc energy and
anglular momentum are given by

where α is the initial angle between vectors Vi and ri and

where we have expressed velocity in terms of the escape veloc-
ity needed for the star to be ejected from the system, Vesc =
√
2M/D0. The last expression corresponds to Eq. 2 and is use-
ful only for angles with |sin α| > 2a0/D0. For smaller angles all
stars come close to the SMBH binary. Since the critical angle is
very small, we do not need to apply an absolute maximum for
the initial velocity.
