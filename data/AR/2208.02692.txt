ABSTRACT

Context. B-type supergiants are versatile tools to address a number of highly-relevant astrophysical topics, ranging from stellar
atmospheres over stellar and galactic evolution to the characterisation of interstellar sightlines and to the cosmic distance scale.
Aims. A hybrid non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) approach – involving line-blanketed model atmospheres computed under
the assumption of LTE in combination with line formation calculations that account for deviations from LTE – is tested for quantitative
analyses of B-type supergiants of mass up to about 30 M(cid:12), characterising a sample of 14 Galactic objects in a comprehensive way.
Methods. Hydrostatic plane-parallel atmospheric structures and synthetic spectra computed with Kurucz’s Atlas12 code together
with the non-LTE line-formation codes Detail/Surface are compared to results from full non-LTE calculations with Tlusty, and
the eﬀects of turbulent pressure on the models are investigated. High-resolution spectra at signal-to-noise ratio > 130 are analysed for
atmospheric parameters, using Stark-broadened hydrogen lines and multiple metal ionisation equilibria, and for elemental abundances.
Fundamental stellar parameters are derived by considering stellar evolution tracks and Gaia early data release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes.
Interstellar reddening and the reddening law along the sight lines towards the target stars are determined by matching model spectral
energy distributions to observed ones.
Results. Our hybrid non-LTE approach turns out to be equivalent to hydrostatic full non-LTE modelling for the deeper photospheric
layers of the B-type supergiants under consideration, where most lines of the optical spectrum are formed. Turbulent pressure can
become relevant for microturbulent velocities larger than 10 km s−1. The changes in the atmospheric density structure aﬀect many di-
agnostic lines, implying systematic changes in atmospheric parameters, for instance an increase in surface gravities by up to 0.05 dex.
A high precision and accuracy is achieved for all derived parameters by bringing multiple indicators to agreement simultaneously.
Eﬀective temperatures are determined to 2-3% uncertainty, surface gravities to better than 0.07 dex, masses to about 5%, radii to about
10%, luminosities to better than 25%, and spectroscopic distances to 10% uncertainty typically. Abundances for chemical species that
are accessible from the optical spectra (He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe) are derived with uncertainties of 0.05 to 0.10 dex
(1σ standard deviations). The observed spectra are reproduced well by the model spectra. The derived N/C versus N/O ratios tightly
follow the predictions from Geneva stellar evolution models that account for rotation, and spectroscopic and Gaia EDR3 distances are
closely matched. Finally, the methodology is tested for analyses of intermediate-resolution spectra of extragalactic B-type supergiants.

1. Introduction

Massive stars are drivers of the evolution of galaxies as they are
crucial contributors to the energy and momentum budget of the
interstellar medium (ISM), and they are sources of nucleosyn-
thesis products (e.g. Matteucci 2008). This is because of their
ionising radiation, their strong stellar winds, and ﬁnal fate in su-
pernova explosions and – under certain circumstances – as γ-
ray bursts. Multiple facets of the evolution of single and binary
massive stars are largely understood, though many details have
yet to be resolved (e.g. Maeder & Meynet 2012; Langer 2012;
Sana et al. 2012), with several independent grids of evolution-
ary models being available (e.g. Brott et al. 2011; Ekström et al.
2012; Limongi & Chieﬃ 2018; Szécsi et al. 2022). Improve-
ments in our understanding of galactic and massive star evolu-
tion are driven by observational constraints, either qualitatively
by consideration of new aspects, or quantitatively by a reduction
in observational uncertainties (which is of interest here).

The evolution of massive stars in the upper Hertzsprung-Rus-
sell diagram (HRD) splits overall into two domains, connected to
the Humphreys-Davidson limit (Humphreys & Davidson 1979).

Stars more massive than ∼40 M(cid:12) remain blue objects through-
out their entire life because strong stellar winds and probably
pulsational instabilities lead to the loss of their envelopes. These
early and mid-O dwarfs and giants on the main sequence (MS)
evolve into early B-type hypergiants (e.g. Clark et al. 2012; Her-
rero et al. 2022) and supergiants of luminosity class Ia, which
constitute one of the more frequently populated regions of post-
MS evolution in the HRD (e.g. Castro et al. 2014). In this evolu-
tionary stage, they belong to the visually brightest stars in star-
forming galaxies in addition to their high energy output at UV
wavelengths and they are likely to become luminous blue vari-
ables (LBVs) at more advanced evolutionary stages, and ﬁnally
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Realistic quantitative spectroscopy of
these objects requires hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere mod-
els that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equi-
librium (non-LTE) and metal-line blanketing (Hillier & Miller
1998; Pauldrach et al. 2001; Gräfener et al. 2002; Puls et al.
2005).

The less massive stars (i.e. M (cid:46) 30 M(cid:12)) with bolometric mag-
nitudes larger than about −9.5 to −10 mag evolve into red super-
giants (RSGs) with extended hydrogen-rich envelopes at least

once during their lifetime. They become B-type supergiants of
luminosity classes Ib and Iab and at the lower limit of the mas-
sive star regime at ∼8-9 M(cid:12) also bright giants (luminosity class
II) when they evolve from late-O and early-B dwarfs on the MS
on their way towards the RSG stage. Alternatively, some B-type
supergiants may be post-RSG objects like Sk −69◦ 202, the pre-
cursor of SN 1987A (West et al. 1987), with possible evolution-
ary channels provided by binary (Podsiadlowski 1992) as well as
single star evolution (Hirschi et al. 2004). Such objects should be
rare. While signatures of mass-loss are still present in the spec-
tra of these lower-luminosity B-type supergiants, in the optical
part of the spectrum they are restricted to a few spectral lines
like Hα. The photospheric spectrum on the other hand is formed
under conditions close to hydrostatic equilibrium, so that hy-
drostatic line-blanketed non-LTE model atmospheres (Hubeny
& Lanz 1995) may be employed for their quantitative analysis.
This was conﬁrmed by a comparison of hydrostatic and hydro-
dynamic non-LTE model atmospheres for luminous early B-type
supergiants by Dufton et al. (2005).

Galactic B-type supergiants have been investigated for a long
time, starting with the early work on the B1 Ib star ζ Per by
Cayrel (1958) based on photographic plate spectra and the stud-
ies of Dufton (1972, 1979) using improved LTE model atmo-
spheres. The advent of spectroscopy with CCD detectors facil-
itated the ﬁrst spectral atlas of Galactic B-type supergiants to
be obtained at optical wavelengths and spectral line behaviours
to be investigated qualitatively over the entire spectral type
(Lennon et al. 1992, 1993). This dataset was later employed
for the ﬁrst larger-scale investigation of atmospheric parameters
and the chemical abundances of B-type supergiants, employing
plane-parallel and hydrostatic non-LTE atmospheres composed
of hydrogen and helium, plus subsequent line-formation compu-
tations for the metals (McErlean et al. 1999). A main focus were
abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen as tracers for the
presence of CN(O)-processed material in the atmospheres, mod-
iﬁed from initial standard values due to evolutionary processes.
The Lennon et al. spectra were also utilised to derive stellar wind
parameters for Galactic B-type supergiants by Kudritzki et al.
(1999) to constrain the wind momentum-luminosity relationship
(Puls et al. 1996) for distance measurements of this kind of ob-
ject, employing hydrodynamical H+He model atmospheres in
non-LTE. About the same time some B-type supergiants were
employed in the derivation of Galactic abundance gradients, us-
ing a diﬀerential pure LTE analysis (Smartt et al. 2001b).

Studies with sophisticated line-blanketed non-LTE model at-
mospheres followed, concentrating on the derivation of atmo-
spheric, stellar wind, and fundamental parameters, often em-
ploying observational data of higher resolving power and wider
wavelength coverage than in the earlier work (Crowther et al.
2006; Lefever et al. 2007; Markova & Puls 2008; Searle et al.
2008; Haucke et al. 2018). Elemental abundances were dis-
cussed in some of these works, focusing again on carbon, nitro-
gen, and oxygen as tracers for mixing of the atmospheric layers
with nuclear-processed material from the stellar core. Models
predict very tight correlations for the surface CNO abundances
independent of single or binary star evolution (Przybilla et al.
2010; Maeder et al. 2014). More comprehensive chemical in-
formation (C, N, O, Mg, and Si) was derived by use of line-
blanketed hydrostatic non-LTE model atmospheres for B-type
supergiants in Galactic open clusters by Hunter et al. (2009),
while Fraser et al. (2010) studied atmospheric parameters, ni-
trogen abundances, and rotational and macroturbulent velocities
based on high-resolution spectra. Similar work with an extended
observational database was later conducted by Simón-Díaz et al.

(2017). On the cool end of the B-type supergiants and towards
the early A-type supergiants a sample of objects was analysed
by Firnstein & Przybilla (2012), using techniques very similar to
those employed in the present work (Przybilla et al. 2006a).

The enormous luminosities of B-type supergiants makes
their spectroscopy feasible at distances beyond the Milky Way.
Objects in the Magellanic Clouds were therefore intensely stud-
ied, concentrating initially on the more metal-poor Small Mag-
ellanic Cloud (SMC, Trundle et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2005; Dufton
et al. 2005), where surface enrichments with nuclear-processed
matter due to rotational mixing were predicted to be stronger
(e.g. Maeder & Meynet 2001; Georgy et al. 2013). Only later
was attention turned towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC,
Hunter et al. 2009; McEvoy et al. 2015; Urbaneja et al. 2017).

Even earlier, ﬁrst studies of B-type supergiants were under-
taken for more distant galaxies of the Local Group, based on
intermediate-resolution spectra and aiming at the determination
of stellar parameters and elemental abundances. Work on M31,
based on the McErlean et al. (1999) approach or LTE techniques
(Smartt et al. 2001a; Trundle et al. 2002) and on NGC6822
(Muschielok et al. 1999) was followed by studies of M33 super-
giants using hydrodynamical non-LTE atmospheres (Urbaneja
et al. 2005b; U et al. 2009), aiming at the derivation of abun-
dance and metallicity gradients, and distances. Metallicities and
distances (derived via application of the Flux-weighted Gravity-
Luminosity Relationship, FGLR, Kudritzki et al. 2003, 2008)
were also the focus of studies of the Local Group dwarf irregu-
lar galaxies IC1613 (Bresolin et al. 2007; Berger et al. 2018) and
WLM (Bresolin et al. 2006; Urbaneja et al. 2008).

B-type supergiants in galaxies beyond the Local Group
have also been studied, investigating not only stellar parame-
ters, metallicities and metallicity gradients, but also interstel-
lar reddening in these galaxies, distances, and the galaxy mass-
metallicity relationship (e.g. Lequeux et al. 1979; Tremonti et al.
2004; Maiolino et al. 2008), which is a key to the study of galaxy
evolution. Objects in NGC300 (Bresolin et al. 2002, 2004; Ur-
baneja et al. 2003, 2005a) and NGC55 (Castro et al. 2012; Ku-
dritzki et al. 2016) in the Sculptor ﬁlament of galaxies were in-
vestigated, and in NGC3109 (Evans et al. 2007; Hosek et al.
2014), a member of the nearby Antlia-Sextans group. At even
larger distances of about 3.5, 4.5, and 6.5 Mpc, respectively, B-
type supergiants were analysed in the grand design spiral galaxy
M81 (Kudritzki et al. 2012), in the barred spiral galaxy M83
(Bresolin et al. 2016), and in the ﬁeld spiral galaxy NGC3621
(Kudritzki et al. 2014), all based on spectra obtained with 8-
10 m-class telescopes.

In addition to their usefulness for stellar studies, B-type su-
pergiants are frequently employed as background stars for stud-
ies of diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIBs) because they facilitate
sight lines to be covered to large distances and provide continu-
ous spectra with relatively few intrinsic stellar spectral features.
B-type supergiants are therefore not only employed to cover in-
terstellar sight lines in the Milky Way (e.g. Cox et al. 2017;
Ebenbichler et al. 2022), but also as tracers of DIBs in other
galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds (Cox et al. 2006, 2007)
and M31 (Cordiner et al. 2008, 2011).

Overall, B-type supergiants show enormous potential as ver-
satile tools to address multiple astrophysical topics of high rele-
vance. The present paper addresses the quantitative spectroscopy
of B-type supergiants based on a hybrid non-LTE approach
– combining hydrostatic line-blanketed LTE atmospheres with
subsequent non-LTE line formation –, applying state-of-the-art
model atoms. The paper is organised as follows: observations
and the data reduction are summarised in Sect. 2. The hybrid

spectrum is given in Appendix A.

2. Observations and data reduction

High-resolution spectra of 14 Galactic B-type supergiants at
high signal-to-noise ratio S /N constitute the observational basis
for the present work. The spectral range B1.5 to B8 at luminos-
ity classes II, Ib, Iab, and Ia is covered, extending previous work
on late B and early A-type supergiants of similar masses and
luminosities (Przybilla et al. 2006a; Schiller & Przybilla 2008;
Firnstein & Przybilla 2012) towards higher temperatures. Basic
information on the star sample and the observing log are sum-
marised in Table 1. An internal ID number is given, the Henry-
Draper catalogue designation, the spectral type, and an OB as-
sociation or open cluster membership is indicated. Spectral type
information from the SIMBAD database1 is summarised, as well
as from a re-determination in the present work, based on anchor
points of the Morgan-Keenan system and Walborn’s B-type stan-
dards (Gray & Corbally 2009). The luminosity class determina-
tion was based on Balmer line appearance, in particular concen-
trating on Hα. Moreover, photometric data in the Johnson sys-
tem are given in Table 1, the V magnitude and the B − V and
U − B colours. The observing log provides the date of observa-
tion, exposure times, and the S /N of the ﬁnal spectrum, mea-
sured around 5585 Å.

The raw spectra were obtained with two instruments. Objects
in the northern hemisphere were observed with the Fibre Optics
Echelle Cassegrain Spectrograph (FOCES, Pfeiﬀer et al. 1998)
on the Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope in two observing runs in 2001

and 2005. The spectra cover a wavelength range from 3860 to
9580 Å at a resolving power R = λ/∆λ ≈ 40 000, with 2 pixels
covering a ∆λ resolution element. A median ﬁlter was applied to
the raw images to remove eﬀects of bad pixels and cosmics in
an initial step. Then, the FOCES semi-automatic pipeline (Pfeif-
fer et al. 1998) was employed for the data reduction, performing
subtraction of bias and dark current, ﬂatﬁelding, wavelength cal-
ibration using Th-Ar exposures, and rectiﬁcation and merging of
the echelle orders. A major advantage of the FOCES design was
that the order tilt was much more homogeneous than in similar
spectrographs. This facilitated a more robust continuum rectiﬁ-
cation than is usually feasible, even in the case of broad features
like the hydrogen Balmer lines, which can span more than one
echelle order (for a discussion see Korn 2002). Two objects had
multiple exposures taken consecutively that were combined to
increase the S /N of the ﬁnal spectrum.

Objects of the southern hemisphere were observed with the
Fiberfed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS, Kaufer
et al. 1999) on the European Southern Observatory (ESO)/Max-
Planck Society 2.2 m telescope in La Silla, Chile. FEROS pro-
vides a resolving power of R ≈ 48 000, with a 2.2-pixel reso-
lution element. The reduced Phase 3 spectra were downloaded
from the ESO Science Portal2. Continuum normalisation was
achieved by division by a spline function to carefully selected
continuum windows. Only the ∼3800 to 9000 Å range of the full
wavelength coverage of FEROS satisﬁed our quality criteria for
the quantitative analysis.

Examples of the analysed spectra can be seen in Fig. 1, to
demonstrate the data quality achieved for the present work. The
ﬁgure focuses on three diagnostic wavelength regions: the win-
dow around Hδ with Si ii and Si iv lines plus several He i and
O ii lines, among others, the region of the Si iii triplet plus nu-
merous O ii lines and on the wind-aﬀected Hα line with the ad-
jacent strong C ii doublet. We note how the density of spectral
lines increases towards the earlier spectral types. We also note
that objects at luminosity class Ib show nearly symmetric Hα
absorption, that is a negligible stellar wind, while the wind gives

For several of the stars of our sample, IUE data was either
unavailable or inconsistent with the optical and infrared pho-
tometry (possibly because of a misalignment of the aperture).
In these cases photometric measurements by the Astronomical
Netherlands Satellite (ANS, Wesselius et al. 1982) or from the
Belgian/UK Ultraviolet Sky Survey Telescope (S2/68, Thomp-
son et al. 1995) on board the European Space Research Organi-
sation (ESRO) TD1 satellite were used.

rise to pronounced Hα emission at luminosity class Ia, while Hδ
is essentially symmetric at the luminosities covered here.

Besides the optical spectra, additional archival photometric
data and UV spectrophotometry were collected to establish the
objects’ spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For all analysed
objects, optical photometry in the Johnson U, B, and V bands
by Mermilliod (1997) was adopted, J, H, and K magnitudes
from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al.
2006) and W1 to W4 IR-photometric data from the Wide-ﬁeld
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission, from the ALLWISE
data release (Cutri et al. 2021). For a thorough comparison in
the ultraviolet wavelength range, spectrophotometry taken by the
International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) were preferred in our
analysis. The designation and observation date for each IUE-
spectrum used in the analysis are given in Table 2. For both
short-wavelength (SW, λλ1150-1978 Å) and long-wavelength
data (LW, λλ1851-3347 Å) low-resolution spectrophotometry
taken with the large aperture was favoured; in cases where only
high-resolution data were available, the spectra were artiﬁcially
degraded in resolution for the analysis. Whenever possible, SW
and LW data observed close in time were employed.

3. Model atmospheres and spectrum synthesis

Our methodology for the analysis of B-type supergiants is based
on a hybrid non-LTE approach of calculating static, plane-
parallel line-blanketed LTE model atmospheres, which serve as
the basis of non-LTE line formation computations. The basic ap-
proach was outlined by Przybilla et al. (2006a) where its po-
tential to accurately reproduce all relevant spectral features of
late B- and early A-type (BA-type) supergiants was shown. This
methodology was validated in a direct comparison with full non-
LTE hydrodynamic line-blanketed model atmospheres (Nieva &
Simón-Díaz 2011) and was used to derive high-precision atmo-
spheric and fundamental stellar parameters and abundances for
many chemical species in early B-type MS stars (Nieva & Przy-
billa 2012, 2014; Irrgang et al. 2014). Moreover, the hybrid ap-
proach is applicable to analyses of a wide range of other B-type
stars, such as subdwarf B-stars (Przybilla et al. 2006b; Schaﬀen-
roth et al. 2021), MS Bp (Przybilla et al. 2008b), He-strong stars
(Przybilla et al. 2016, 2021), and supergiant extreme helium stars
(Kupfer et al. 2017). In the following, we therefore brieﬂy recap
the basic principles and the model codes and will concentrate on
new aspects relevant for the present work.

3.1. Models and programmes

The LTE line-blanketed model atmospheres used in this work
were calculated with the Atlas12 code (Kurucz 2005), which
assumes plane-parallel geometry, a stationary and hydrostatic
stratiﬁcation, and chemical homogeneity. In contrast to the previ-
ous version Atlas9 (Kurucz 1993, which is still required to pro-
vide converged starting models) it does not rely on pretabulated
opacity distribution functions (ODFs), but evaluates the opacities
via opacity sampling (OS). The code thus facilitates model at-
mospheres to be calculated for freely speciﬁed input abundances
and microturbulent velocities, including the turbulent pressure in
the hydrostatic equation for a self-consistent solution.

The LTE model atmospheres were then used to compute non-
LTE level population densities via an updated and extended ver-
sion of Detail (Giddings 1981) by solving the coupled radiative
transfer and statistical equillibrium equations adopting an accel-
erated lambda iteration scheme by Rybicki & Hummer (1991),
and considering line blocking based on the Kurucz’ OS scheme.
State-of-the-art model atoms were employed, as summarised in
Table 3. There, for each chemical species the considered ions are
listed, the number of explicit terms (+ superlevels) and radiative
bound-bound transitions, and references. All model atoms are
completed by the ground term of the next higher ionisation stage
not indicated here.

While most of the model atoms were used previously in other
studies, a new model atom for O ii was employed in the present
work for the ﬁrst time. We describe it brieﬂy. Level energies
were adopted from Martin et al. (1993) and combined into 176
LS-coupled terms up to principal quantum number n = 8 and the
levels for n = 9 combined into two superlevels, one each for the
doublet and quartet spin systems. Oscillator strengths and pho-
toionisation cross-sections were for the most part adopted from
the Opacity Project (OP, e.g. Seaton et al. 1994), with several
improved data taken from Wiese et al. (1996), and supplemented
by Kurucz’ recently computed oscillator strengths3 for missing
transitions. Electron impact-excitation data for a large number
of transitions were available from the ab-initio calculations of
Tayal (2007) and Mao et al. (2020). Missing data were provided
by use of Van Regemorter’s formula (van Regemorter 1962) for
radiatively permitted or Allen’s formula (Allen 1973) for for-

bidden transitions. All collisional ionisation data were provided
via the Seaton formula (Seaton 1962) using OP photoionisation
threshold cross-sections or hydrogenic values.

Finally, synthetic spectra based on the non-LTE population
numbers were calculated using an updated and extended version
of Surface (Butler & Giddings 1985), employing reﬁned ﬁne-
structure transition data and line-broadening theories. Oscillator
strengths from Wiese et al. (1996) and Kurucz were replaced
by data computed based on the multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock
method by Froese Fischer & Tachiev (2004) for O ii (as for other
elements and ions, also accounting for data from Froese Fischer
et al. 2006), which was decisive in achieving the close match
with observations. For both Detail and Surface an occupation
probability formalism (Hummer & Mihalas 1988) – as realised
by Hubeny et al. (1994) – was considered for hydrogen, in order
to facilitate a better modelling of the series limits.

Grids of synthetic spectra were calculated with Atlas12, De-
tail, and Surface – abbreviated as Ads in the following – for
the entire parameter space of B-type supergiants. For the pri-
mary analysis of Balmer-lines and ionisation equilibria of all
metals, eﬀective temperatures Teﬀ were varied from 11 000 to
23 000 K in steps of 500 to 700 K, logarithmic surface gravi-
ties log g from 1.70 to 3.70 (in cgs-units) in steps of 0.2 dex,
and elemental abundances in steps of 0.2 dex, centred on cosmic
abundance standard values (Nieva & Przybilla 2012; Przybilla
et al. 2008a, 2013). For nitrogen, much higher values up to 1 dex
above standard were covered because of the expected enrich-
ment. Microturbulent velocities ξ were varied with increments
of 4 km s−1 initially and reﬁned later to as low as 1 km s−1. The
analysis was carried out – depending on the convergence of the
model atmospheres – on grids ranging from 0 up to 16 km s−1 in
microturbulence, that is subsonic velocities.

We employed the Spectral Plotting and Analysis Suite (Spas,
Hirsch 2009) to compare the synthetic and observed spectra. The
programme allows instrumental, (radial-tangential) macroturbu-

lent and rotational broadening to be applied ﬂexibly to the mod-
els and can be used to interpolate to the actual parameters with
bi-cubic splines and ﬁt up to three diﬀerent parameters on the
pre-calculated grid. To achieve this task, the programme employs
the downhill simplex algorithm (Nelder & Mead 1965) to ﬁnd
minima in the χ2-landscape.

3.2. Comparison with full non-LTE models
Non-LTE eﬀects gain in importance for more intense radiation
ﬁelds (i.e. with increasing Teﬀ) and reduced collision rates (i.e.
with decreasing particle density). The atmospheric structures of
B-type supergiants are therefore likely to be subject to non-LTE
eﬀects. Our hybrid non-LTE approach will only be successful if
solutions from full non-LTE modelling can be closely recovered.
A comparison of a full non-LTE model atmosphere for so-
lar metallicity (Grevesse & Sauval 1998) as adopted from the
BSTAR grid (Lanz & Hubeny 2007) that was computed using
the Tlusty code (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) with an Atlas12 struc-
ture is shown in Fig. 2, for model parameters Teﬀ = 20 000 K,
log g = 2.50, and ξ = 10 km s−1. The temperature T and electron
density ne stratiﬁcation as a function of Rosseland optical depth
τR is shown. Line-formation depths for some of the strongest
diagnostic spectral features in the optical spectrum are also indi-
cated, with the bulk of the metal lines being formed towards the
inner boundary of this region. We want to note that the metal-
licity of the Atlas12 model (computed explicitly for abundances
according to Grevesse & Sauval 1998) was reduced by 0.2 dex
in order to account empirically for non-LTE eﬀects on the line
blanketing. At the same metallicity, supergiant atmospheres in
LTE and non-LTE show diﬀerent temperature gradients because
of the diﬀerent amount of backwarming because of line blan-
keting and blocking. Empirically, a reduction of metallicity of
LTE atmospheres by 0.2 dex can compensate this diﬀerences
(see Fig. 2). The necessity for such an adjustment also follows
on observational grounds. In order to reproduce the observed
spectral lines, the real temperature gradient in the stellar atmo-
sphere has to be matched by the model, as the diﬀerent formation
depths from line cores to the wings near the continuum-forming

layers of the entire ensemble of the lines map the temperature
(and density) structure in the atmosphere in detail. Achieving a
match between observation and model as shown in the ﬁgures in
Appendix A requires the reproduction of the actual atmospheric
structure by the model. To reproduce the observed SEDs, in par-
ticular for the cases where IUE spectrophotometry is available,
also requires the reduction of the overall Atlas atmosphere’s
metallicity. Otherwise the line absorption in the UV is stronger
than observed. Thus, the empirical metallicity adjustment mim-
ics non-LTE eﬀects on the line opacity. The eﬀect of a reduction
of metallicity by 0.2 dex in the LTE model can be applied glob-
ally to supergiant models covering the range of eﬀective temper-
atures investigated here, and only diminishes for models towards
the main sequence. It can even be extended to early B-type su-
pergiants as tested for a model with Teﬀ = 27 000 K, log g = 3.00,
and ξ = 10 km s−1. In all cases the agreement of the adapted At-
las12 stratiﬁcations with the Tlusty structures is good through-
out the photospheric line-formation depths, with diﬀerences less
than 2% in T and 8% in ne and only starts to deviate more for
log τR < −2, where eﬀects of the mass outﬂow would start to lead
to departures from hydrostatic equilibrium in a real B-type su-
pergiant atmosphere anyway.

The comparison of the Tlusty and Detail non-LTE SEDs for
the above parameters is shown in Fig. 3. The agreement long-
ward of the Lyman limit is excellent overall, with the diﬀerences
amounting to only a few percent. Also the hydrogen series lim-
its (see the insets in Fig. 3) resemble each other closely because
the same occupation probability formalism is employed in both
codes. Larger diﬀerences occur at wavelengths below the Lyman
limit, and in particular below the He i ionisation limit (locations
indicated in Fig. 3), where Tlusty predicts (signiﬁcantly) higher
ionising ﬂuxes. The atmospheric layers that emit this extreme-
ultraviolet radiation are located in the outermost regions of the
model atmosphere. Consequently the diﬀerences are not rele-
vant for the photospheric lines investigated here. Moreover, as
these layers are not in hydrostatic equilibrium in real B-type su-
pergiant atmospheres, the predictive power of both models pre-
sented here is limited and would be better investigated with hy-
drodynamical stellar atmosphere models.

calculated with Ads (blue lines) and Tlusty/Synspec (black lines). The dotted blue lines correspond to a model computed with Surface only on an
Atlas12 atmospheric structure, i.e. representing an LTE solution using otherwise the same input data as in the Ads non-LTE model.

A further comparison of proﬁles for a selection of diagnostic
hydrogen Balmer and He i lines as calculated by Tlusty/Synspec
and Ads for the above atmospheric parameters is shown in
Fig. 4. The match between the two non-LTE synthetic spectra
for these two chemical species is excellent except for some ﬁne
details. These concern the line cores of the Balmer lines, with
the diﬀerences diminishing towards the higher series members,
and some of the forbidden components of the He i lines, which
are explained by the use of diﬀerent broadening tables. How-
ever, the corresponding LTE model shows much weaker lines
throughout, with the equivalent widths diﬀering by factors of up
to two to three. Overall, the diﬀerences increase towards the red.
Pure LTE modelling is inapplicable for quantitative analyses of
B-type supergiants.

In particular, the panels in Fig. 4 that show the Balmer lines
cover a wider wavelength range and also depict spectral lines
from other chemical species. In most cases the diﬀerences be-
tween the two models are large. However, a straightforward
comparison of these should not be made, because – in contrast
to H and He, with their rather well-established atomic input data
– most of the diﬀerences stem from the diﬀerent atomic data
used and the diﬀerent assumptions made in the construction of
the model atoms that were used in the two approaches. A de-

tailed discussion of these aspects for the case of OB-type main-
sequence stars was presented by Przybilla et al. (2011), which
we do not repeat here. The basic conclusion is that the ability of
diﬀerent models to reproduce observations in a consistent way is
decisive.

3.3. Turbulent pressure
The Atlas12 code allows the eﬀects of turbulent motions with
velocity (cid:51)turb (i.e. the microturbulent velocity) on the model at-
mosphere computations to be taken into account. An additional
turbulent pressure Pturb term is considered in the hydrostatic
equilibrium equation in the form of

Pturb =

ρ(cid:51)2
turb
2

,

(1)

where ρ is the atmospheric density. This additional term in-
creases in importance for stars approaching the Eddington limit
because of the diminishing rôle of the gas pressure, and for in-
creasing (cid:51)turb. Since it is possible to enable and disable turbulent
pressure in the model speciﬁcation of Atlas12, we can directly
compare the eﬀects of this term on the atmospheric structure and
the synthetic spectra, while keeping all other parameters ﬁxed.

This impacts the atmospheric parameter and abundance determi-
nation to some small, but systematic, degree. Turbulent pressure
is therefore considered in all analyses in the present work.

4. Spectral analysis

4.1. Atmospheric parameter and abundance determination

The basic atmospheric parameters were determined via an anal-
ysis of the spectral features of multiple ionisation stages of seven
diﬀerent chemical species (C, N, O, Ne, Al, Si, and Fe) as well
as the analysis of the neutral helium lines and the Balmer lines of
hydrogen. These parameters, eﬀective temperature Teﬀ, surface
gravity log g, helium number fraction y, microturbulent veloc-
ity ξ, projected rotational velocity (cid:51) sin i, macroturbulence ζ as
well as the elemental abundances ε (X) = log (X/H) + 12, were
derived on the basis of spectrum synthesis, aiming at the re-
production of the detailed line proﬁles of features spanning the
entire observed visual to near-infrared spectra. An iterative ap-
proach was employed to overcome ambiguities because of strong
correlations, until all parameters were constrained in a consistent
way and a single global solution for the synthetic spectrum was
found that matches closely the entire observed spectrum.

4.1.1. Effective temperature and surface gravity

In order to begin the analysis, an initial guess on the ba-
sis of spectral type and the shape and strength of the Balmer
lines suﬃces for an estimation to within ∆Teﬀ < 1500 K and
∆ log g < 0.4 dex. Ambiguities in these two parameters arise due
to their counteracting nature: in the regime of B-type super-
giants, the Balmer lines grow weaker with Teﬀ as hydrogen is
increasingly ionised, while increasing in strength with surface
gravity due to the pressure broadening. Hence, multiple com-
binations of Teﬀ and log g ﬁt the observations. This means that
Balmer line ﬁtting alone is insuﬃcient for a thorough analysis.
The problem is solved by independently constraining Teﬀ and
log g using multiple ionisation equilibria of the studied elements,
that is requiring that lines from the diﬀerent ionisation stages
of a chemical element are reproduced at the same elemental
abundance value (within the mutual uncertainties). Table 4 sum-
marises which ionisation balances were employed for the anal-
ysis of the sample stars, sorted from highest to lowest Teﬀ. Dots
indicate that lines from the respective ionisation stage were anal-
ysed, the blue boxes then frame the achieved ionisation balance.
Some combinations were useful throughout the entire Teﬀ-range,
for example O i/ii or Si ii/iii, while other ionisation stages appear
only towards the highest Teﬀ-values, like C iii, Ne ii or Si iv and
others such as N i, Al ii or Fe ii are no longer visible. Four to
seven ionisation balances were matched simultaneously per star,
with the tightest constraints occurring if three consecutive ion-
isation stages could be employed, as in the case of Si ii/iii/iv.
Overall, ionisation balances are more sensitive to Teﬀ-variations,
while the Balmer lines are more sensitive to log g-variations. The
ﬁnally adopted values of eﬀective temperature and surface grav-
ity, and their uncertainties, were then calculated as the arithmetic
mean and standard deviation of the values implied by the indi-
vidual indicators. In most of the sample objects, Hα (see Fig. 1
for examples) had to be excluded from the analysis because of
line asymmetries or the occurrence of emission due to the stel-
lar wind. In the most luminous stars, Hβ, Hγ, and even Hδ may
show signs of inﬂuence from the stellar wind and they were also
omitted from the ﬁtting process.

Upper panel: temperature stratiﬁcation, lower panel: electron density as
a function of the logarithmic Rosseland optical depth. Displayed are At-
las12 stratiﬁcations computed with (full line) and without considering
turbulent pressure (dashed line) for Teﬀ = 18 600 K and log g = 2.45, i.e.
the atmospheric parameters for HD 14818.

As a test, we chose the sample star HD 14818, at Teﬀ = 18 600 K,
log g = 2.45, and a derived high luminosity, log L/L(cid:12) = 5.41. We
expected to ﬁnd a maximised impact on the model atmospheric
structure because of its large ξ = 14 km s−1.

Figure 5 visualises the run of temperature T (upper panel)
and the logarithmic electron density ne (lower panel) as a func-
tion of log-scale Rosseland optical depth τR in the model at-
mosphere of HD 14818 for the two cases of turbulent pressure
switched on and oﬀ, respectively. While the temperature hardly
changes, with a maximum diﬀerence of about 50 K (being higher
in the model with turbulent pressure), the electron density is no-
ticeably lower for log τR < 0 when turbulent pressure is consid-
ered because of the more extended atmosphere. Here, the abso-
lute diﬀerence is about 0.12 dex in log ne at log τR = −1.

Figure 6 shows the eﬀects of the models with and without
turbulent pressure for otherwise identical parameters on various
spectral line proﬁles. It can be seen that for the ﬁtted lines of
hydrogen (Hδ and Hε) the decreased density in the atmospheres
with turbulent pressure corresponds to reduced pressure broad-
ening of the Balmer line wings. Conversely, the model without
turbulent pressure appears like a model with increased pressure
broadening corresponding to the eﬀect of an increase in surface
gravity of about ∆ log g ≈ 0.05 dex. A systematic eﬀect can also
be detected in lines of helium and some metallic lines (Si ii, C ii,
and S ii) which mostly show enhanced line strength for models
without turbulent pressure (the exception being the sulphur line
at 4253 Å). The eﬀect stems from a shift in the ionisation bal-
ance, yielding a higher degree of ionisation in the model that ac-
counts for microturbulent pressure. This amounts to a reduction
of equivalent widths of individual Si ii lines by ∼15 to 25% for
the example of HD 14818 (the equivalent width of Si ii λ4130 Å
in Fig. 6 is e.g. reduced by 16%), while the lines of the main ion-
isation stage Si iii remain essentially unchanged, and Si iv lines
experience a slight strengthening by <5% in equivalent width.

4.1.2. Helium abundance

In the ﬁrst step of the iterative procedure, the helium number
density was set to the cosmic value of y = 0.089 (Nieva & Przy-
billa 2012) in order to derive a satisfactory estimate for eﬀective
temperature and surface gravity. With these values, ﬁtting of the
weakest helium lines permitted a reﬁned abundance estimate for
helium with relative uncertainties between δy (cid:66) ∆y/y ≈ 5–15%
to be derived. Stronger lines were generally excluded from the
analysis, as they are less sensitive to abundance changes. Con-
straining the helium abundance is of importance not only per se.
It strongly inﬂuences the molecular weight of the atmospheric
elemental mixture and thereby changes the density and pressure
stratiﬁcation of the atmosphere, leading to changes in the derived
surface gravity of up to ∆ log g = 0.05 dex. Further changes of the
helium abundance in the following steps of the iteration scheme
(i.e. after correcting Teﬀ, log g, and ξ) were considered, but were
found to lie within the uncertainties of the ﬁrst determination.

Turbulent ﬂows of matter on scales smaller than unit optical-
depth can inﬂuence the shape and strength of spectral lines. They
are parameterised as an ad-hoc microturbulence broadening pa-
rameter ξ (measured in km s−1) in addition to thermal broaden-
ing. Since this microturbulent velocity directly inﬂuences the
broadening and therefore also the strength of the ﬁtted metal
lines, an incorrect value will lead to oﬀsets in ionisation bal-
ances and consequently to inaccurate estimates of eﬀective tem-
perature. In fact, because of the pressure of the turbulent matter
ﬂows, microturbulence can also change the density structure of
the atmosphere noticeably (see Sect. 3.3), aﬀecting the surface
gravity determination.

The appropriate value for ξ can be found by enforcing the
criterion that the abundances derived from various spectral lines
of a given element are independent of the strength of the spectral
lines. For the analysis of our sample, we measured the equiva-
lent widths Wλ of several trustworthy lines of N i/ii and Si ii/iii/iv
as auxiliary quantities by direct integration of the observed spec-
tral lines and compared their ﬁtted abundances (from spectrum
synthesis) for multiple values of ξ. This procedure is shown in
Fig. 7: as ξ increases, the equivalent widths of the strong lines
are aﬀected more markedly by microturbulent broadening such
that the abundance values necessary to ﬁt them are reduced. The
correct value for ξ is found when the ﬁtted individual line abun-
dances of a given element no longer correlate with their Wλ and
the line-to-line abundance scatter is minimised. Uncertainties of
the equivalent widths are of the order of the symbol size. In
the given sample plot, the determinations are consistent with a
microturbulent velocity of ξ ≈ 14 km s−1. The value so derived
was then checked for consistency with multiple lines of C ii and
Mg ii in later steps of the atmospheric parameter iteration, and
with Fe ii/iii lines in a further inspection. Corrections of ∆ξ ≈ 1–
2 km s−1 to the initial value were implied with respect to the ini-
tial value in some cases, such that a ﬁnal value was obtained,
fully consistent with the available indicators from several chem-
ical species and ions.

a function of equivalent width for varying values of microturbulence, as indicated. The blue lines depict the best linear ﬁt to the data.

4.1.4. Projected rotational velocity and macroturbulence

Since the parameters of projected rotational velocity (cid:51) sin i and
macroturbulent velocity ζ do not aﬀect the model atmosphere
structure nor inﬂuence the line formation, their derivation is not
related to time-expensive grid calculations. By convolution of
the synthetic spectrum with the corresponding rotational and
macroturbulent broadening functions (realised here by a radial-
tangential model, Gray 1975) and by ﬁtting weak metal lines of
the observed spectra, we can ﬁnd well-ﬁtting values to within
about 10% uncertainty for both (cid:51) sin i and ζ. As has been pointed
out in previous studies, multiple values of a pair of these param-
eters can lead to a similarly satisfactory ﬁt to individual lines
(e.g. Ryans et al. 2002; Firnstein & Przybilla 2012; Simón-Díaz
& Herrero 2014). However, this ambiguity of solutions may be
minimised using suited line blends, see for example Fig. 11 of
Przybilla et al. (2006a) or Fig. 5 of Firnstein & Przybilla (2012).
The existence of non-rotational broadening in B-type super-
giants is well established. Physically, surface motions due to a
sub-surface convection zone and stellar pulsations, among oth-
ers, are the phenomena that are subsumed by the macroturbu-
lence parameter (Simón-Díaz et al. 2017).

4.1.5. Elemental abundances

Having derived a consistent solution for all primary atmospheric
parameters, abundances of all investigated elements and ions
were once more determined in a last step in order to allow a
consistent ﬁt of a single synthetic spectrum to the observed spec-
trum to be made. The ﬁnal abundances of the individual elements
were then computed as the arithmetic mean of the entire sample
of ﬁtted lines and the respective uncertainty as the 1σ standard
deviation. For the speciﬁcation of the abundance of an element
X, the customary logarithmic scale normalised to 12 was chosen,
such that ε(X) = log(X/H) + 12.

A selected sub-sample of lines in one of the analysed spec-
tra is shown in Fig. 8 compared to the best-ﬁtting model. The

simultaneous reproduction of the Balmer lines, the helium and
metal lines of diﬀerent ionisation stages regardless of individual
strength demonstrates the consistency of the derived solution.

4.2. Stellar mass and age

The derivation of the spectroscopically accessible atmospheric
parameters (in conjunction with the photometric data) allowed
the determination of stellar masses. Eﬀective temperature and
surface gravity alone suﬃce to derive the initial, or zero-age
main-sequence stellar mass MZAMS. For this, we deﬁne the spec-
troscopic luminosity L as

L /L(cid:12) =

(Langer & Kudritzki 2014), where the values for the solar ef-
fective temperature and surface gravity are Teﬀ,(cid:12) = 5777 K and
log g(cid:12) = 4.44. Figure 9 shows the sample stars in a ’spectro-
scopic’ Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (sHRD) with tracks of stel-
lar evolution models according to Ekström et al. (2012) tracing
the spectroscopic luminosity as a function of log-scale eﬀective
temperature. Interpolating on this grid of rotating models, we
derived MZAMS. Under the assumption of a normal, single-star,
red-ward evolution in the HRD we then interpolated the model
tracks in eﬀective temperature to estimate the objects’ current
masses Mevol in their respective evolved state. Depending on the
initial mass of the objects, the evolved stars lost more than 2 M(cid:12)
through their stellar wind at the high mass limit of the sample
and negligibly little (< 0.05 M(cid:12)) for the least massive objects.
From a comparison of rotating versus non-rotating models, it is
apparent that the derived masses depend on the initial rotational
velocity. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that values of Mevol – as derived
from non-rotating models – are larger by up to 7 M(cid:12) at the high
mass limit and about 1 M(cid:12) larger at the lower mass limit of our
sample. The initial rotational velocities of the sample stars on the
ZAMS are unknown. However, mass loss (and therefore angu-
lar momentum loss) and the expansion to supergiant dimensions

lead to a strong reduction of the rotational velocities, for example
from about 300 km s−1 on the ZAMS to about 50 km s−1 for the
rotating models of Ekström et al. (2012) at the boundary spanned
by the stars ID#2 to #10 to #12 in Fig. 9. As our sample stars
show (cid:51) sin i-values between about 20 to 50 km s−1 one would ex-
pect them to stem from stars with about average rotation on the
ZAMS, and we can exclude initially very slow rotators with con-
ﬁdence, as they would be seen near zero (cid:51) sin i at the supergiant
stage. We note, however, that the predictive power of the stel-
lar evolution models needs to be treated with caution because of
remaining uncertainties of the models. We therefore would like
to stress that our results were obtained under the stated assump-
tions, and some small-scale systematic errors are likely to be
present in the fundamental stellar parameters, but these cannot
be quantiﬁed at the current time.

Ages of the stars were derived from interpolation in the
isochrones for the (rotating) stellar evolution models of Ekström
et al. (2012). Again, a normal red-ward evolution as single stars
was assumed for the sample objects.

= mV − AV the dereddened Johnson V magnitude in
of M(cid:12), mV0
mag, and log g the logarithmic surface gravity in cgs units. Equa-
tion 3 utilises the Vega ﬂux calibration according to Heber et al.
(1984) and provides distances in units of pc.

We have to stress once more that our Mevol-values were de-
rived under the assumption of the overall applicability of the evo-
lution tracks for rotating stars by Ekström et al. (2012). As we
have argued in Sect. 4.2, the true initial rotational velocities of
the sample stars are unknown, therefore some additional system-
atic uncertainty applies to the spectroscopic distances according
to Eqn. 3 that may either increase or decrease the derived value.
These spectroscopic distances dspec may be compared to dis-
tances dGaia derived from Gaia early data release 3 (EDR3) paral-
laxes (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2021). One potential issue
is a mismatch of the Gaia distance with the spectroscopic dis-
tance because of a biased evolutionary mass, however the eﬀects
are only of order ∝ M1/2
evol. Alternatively, this can uncover poten-
tially undetected problems with the spectroscopic analysis. For
instance, widely diverging estimations of distances can hint at
an incorrect value for the surface gravity as this parameter con-
tributes most of the uncertainty to the equation. It can, however,
also uncover an unusual evolutionary development of an object
in question (see Sect. 5.5). Gaia EDR3 parallaxes may also be af-
fected by bias, such as increased uncertainties for the ﬁve bright-
est supergiants of the sample with Gaia G magnitude smaller
than 6, or for objects with a large renormalised unit weight er-
ror (RUWE), like HD 51309 (ID#9), HD 125288 (ID#12), and
HD 164353 (ID#14), which have a RUWE of about 2 – all other
objects have RUWE-values around 1.

4.5. Bolometric correction, luminosity and radius

For the calculation of the bolometric correction B.C., we deﬁned
the bolometric magnitude mbol for each star as the direct inte-
gration of its Atlas9 model SED over all wavelengths, with the
integration constant chosen such that a solar Atlas9 model sat-
isﬁes Mbol,(cid:12) = 4.74 (see Bessell et al. 1998). The B.C. was then
calculated as the diﬀerence between mbol and the synthetic mV .
In order to determine the stellar luminosity L, the absolute V-
band magnitude MV was calculated from the observed apparent
magnitude mV (Mermilliod 1997) utilising the derived spectro-
scopic distances dspec (Sect. 4.4), as well as the total-to-selective
extinction RV , and colour excess E(B − V) (Sect. 4.3) in the dis-
tance modulus. Correction of MV by B.C. yielded the absolute
bolometric magnitude Mbol, from which L was derived using the
above value for Mbol,(cid:12). The eﬀective temperature and luminosity
were ﬁnally utilised to determine the stellar radius R by applica-
tion of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Fig. 9. Sample objects located in the spectroscopic HRD, spectro-
scopic luminosity versus log-scale eﬀective temperature, with 1σ error
bars. Stellar evolution tracks (Ekström et al. 2012, for (cid:51)rot = 0.4(cid:51)crit and
Z = 0.014) ranging in ZAMS-masses from 9 to 32 M(cid:12) are indicated in
alternating colours of blue and black. The dashed lines depict the corre-
sponding tracks for non-rotating models. Numbers denote the internal
sample star IDs.

cording to the mean extinction law of Fitzpatrick (1999). The
ﬂux of the observed magnitudes was calibrated with zero-points
and ﬂuxes according to the SVO Filter Proﬁle Sevice5 (Ro-
drigo et al. 2012; Rodrigo & Solano 2020). Models were then
ﬁtted for the two-parameter solution by Fitzpatrick (1999) –
total-to-selective extinction RV = AV /E (B − V) and colour ex-
cess E (B − V) – in order to match the observations. The visual
extinction AV is then simply the product of the two parame-
ters. A diﬀerent approach had to be employed for HD 183143
because of a highly anomalous reddening law, see Ebenbichler
et al. (2022) for details.

This method of examining the SED of our ﬁnal solution gen-
erally worked very well and produced a high-precision charac-
terisation of the interstellar medium along the sight lines towards
the sample objects. In addition to being consistent with small un-
certainties (see Sect. 5.6) the method can detect unusual features
in the extinction curve, such as excess radiation in the WISE pass
bands, hinting at black body radiation contributions to the stel-
lar SED. Speciﬁcally, this process can detect anormalies in the
composition of the interstellar medium along these sight lines,
as in the case of HD 183143 mentioned above.

Notes. Uncertainties are 1σ-values, except where noted otherwise. (a) Gaia Collaboration et al. (2016, 2021) - distances and uncertainties corre-
spond to ’photogeometric distances’ and associated 14th and 86th conﬁdence percentiles (Bailer-Jones et al. 2021).

5.1. Atmospheric and fundamental stellar parameters

For the eﬀective temperature and surface gravity, the uncertain-
ties roughly match the values derived in previous work analysing
BA-type supergiants with a similar analysis approach as em-
ployed here (Firnstein & Przybilla 2012), with δTeﬀ ≈ 1–3% and
∆ log g ≈ 0.05 dex. Abundances of helium were ﬁtted with un-
certainties of δy ≈ 5–15% owing to the line-to-line scatter from
the weakest He i features analysed, that is those most sensitive to
abundance variations.

The uncertainty of the microturbulent velocity is generally
limited by the size of the grid used during the ﬁtting process.
Though observed values of ξ were in some cases inspected on
scales of 1 km s−1, a conservative estimate of ∆ξ ≈ 2 km s−1 is
adopted throughout. Projected rotational velocities show relative
uncertainties amounting to typically δ(cid:51) sin(i) ≈ 10–15% owing to
the degeneracy in the joint derivation with macroturbulent veloc-
ities. For the macroturbulence ζ the uncertainties were estimated
at a value of 5 km s−1.

A similar but weaker ambiguity in deduced values is gen-
erally present in the estimation of total-to-selective extinction
parameter and colour excess. The ﬁtting procedure described in
Sect. 4.3 produces error margins of the order of ∆RV ≈ 0.1 and
∆E(B−V) ≈ 0.03 mag. Although the exact margins in this deriva-
tion depend on the available data (in particular in the UV-range)
these values generally represent the typical uncertainties for the
entire sample. For the derivation of the B.C. no detailed analysis
of uncertainties was conducted, though variation of parameters
in input models hinted at an uncertainty range of ∆B.C. ≈ 0.04–
0.06 mag for both hotter and cooler sample stars.

The parameter of evolved mass Mevol was derived using the
ZAMS mass estimates, tracing their mass loss in evolution tracks
by Ekström et al. (2012), see Sect. 5.7, such that the uncer-
tainties of the evolved masses are assumed to be identical to
the ZAMS mass uncertainty of about δMZAMS = δMevol ≈ 5%.
Radii of sample objects show relative errors of about δR ≈ 10%,
stemming largely from the associated uncertainty in luminos-
ity, which amounts to typically ∆ log L/L(cid:12) ≈ 0.1 dex. The dis-
tances derived in this work show consistent relative uncertainties
of δdspec ≈ 10%, matching the sample mean relative diﬀerence
between the deduced values and those derived from parallactic
distances by the Gaia mission (see Sect. 5.5). The fundamen-
tal parameters can be expected to be subject to a small amount
of additional systematic error because a set of stellar evolution
models for a particular rotational velocity were adopted, see the
discussion in Sect. 4.2.

5.2. Comparison with previous analyses

Many of our sample stars were analysed in previous studies that
employed full non-LTE model atmospheres. For comparison,
data from the following studies were considered:
i) Markova & Puls (2008) employed Fastwind for their anal-
yses. They utilised hydrogen, helium, and Si ii/iii/iv lines to
derive temperature, surface gravity, and microturbulence itera-
tively. The derivation of projected rotational velocities was based
on the analysis of the shape of the Fourier transform (FT) of ab-
sorption lines (Gray 1975; Simón-Díaz & Herrero 2007). Two
objects are in common.

(2017, blue), Markova & Puls (2008, red), and Searle et al. (2008, green). In cases in which an object is present in two or multiple studies the
values are depicted by diamonds and connected with dotted lines. The symbols for HD 183143 and HD 119646 are marked by open symbols. For
better visibility, the mean uncertainties are indicated in the lower right corner.

ii) Searle et al. (2008) used the stellar atmosphere codes Tlusty
and Cmfgen (Hillier & Miller 1998). To estimate the tempera-
ture, the diagnostic silicon lines of Si iv 4089 and Si iii 4552–
4574 Å were used in supergiants of spectral types B0 to B2 and
Si ii 4128–4130 and Si iii 4552–4574 Å for B2.5 to B5 super-
giants. The luminosity was then constrained by inferred values
of the absolute visual magnitude MV and corrected if necessary.
Surface gravity log g was determined by ﬁtting Hγ and Hδ. The
microturbulent velocity was determined by analysing the Si iii
triplet lines. Three objects are in common.
iii) Fraser et al. (2010) used the hydrostatic line-blanketed non-
LTE codes Tlusty and Synspec (Hubeny 1988; Hubeny & Lanz
1995) that consider plane-parallel geometry. Eﬀective tempera-
tures were estimated on the basis of silicon ionisation equilibria
and surface gravities from a ﬁt of the Hγ and Hδ lines. For the de-
termination of microturbulence they relied solely on the analysis
of the Si iii triplet at 4552–4574 Å and projected rotational veloc-
ities were derived using the FT method. Six objects are shared.

iv) Simón-Díaz et al. (2017) used the hydrodynamic line-
blanketed non-LTE code Fastwind (Santolaya-Rey et al. 1997;
Puls et al. 2005) that accounts for spherical geometry, follow-
ing the spectroscopic analysis strategy described by Castro et al.
(2012). They analysed Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, multiple lines of He i, as well
as the silicon multiplets Si ii 4128-4130 Å, Si iii 4552–4574 Å,
and Si iv 4116 Å to derive Teﬀ and log g. For the derivation of
projected rotational velocities they used the iacob-broad tool
(Simón-Díaz & Herrero 2014) on lines of O, Si, Mg, and C, de-
pending on the spectral type of the star. Eight objects are com-
mon to the present work.

Furthermore, a sample of 25 O9.5–B3 Galactic supergiants
were analysed by Crowther et al. (2006) based on Cmfgen mod-
els. We do not compare with this paper since it has only one
object (HD 14818) in common with the present work.

Figure 10, panel a, shows a comparison of the eﬀective tem-
peratures from the literature T lit
eﬀ with those derived here. An
overall good correlation is found with a mean relative diﬀerence

eﬀ,i of less than 1%, and a stan-
dard deviation of 5%. Two objects, HD 119646 and HD 183143
(marked with open symbols), diﬀer by ∼12% in literature ver-
sus present-work Teﬀ with both higher and lower values realised.
Some objects are present in two or more of the cited studies, in
which case the objects are depicted as diamonds. For such ob-
jects the values never scatter by more than about 1000 K.

The comparison of surface gravities is shown graphically in
Fig. 10, panel b. Again, values occurring in more than one study
are depicted as diamonds, but in this comparison, some objects
show a larger scatter among the various studies. For HD 164353
estimates range from log g = 2.46 in Simón-Díaz et al. (2017),
log g = 2.50 in Fraser et al. (2010) to log g = 2.75 in Searle
et al. (2008); for HD 191243 Simón-Díaz et al. (2017) derive
log g = 2.45, while Markova & Puls (2008) ﬁnds log g = 2.61 and
Searle et al. (2008) again give the largest value of log g = 2.75,
that is diﬀerences up to a factor of 2. Treating the literature val-
ues as one complete comparison set, a systematic oﬀset towards
higher log g values in the present work may be noticed. One may
speculate that this trend may be due to the inclusion of Pturb in
our analysis, resulting in a systematic increase of log g. However,
we have demonstrated that the eﬀect of this term in the model is
limited to ∼0.05 dex even in objects with large microturbulent
velocities close to the Eddington limit (see Sect. 3.3). In light
of the large uncertainties of the literature values, small number
statistics, and general diﬀerences between the trends in the dif-
ferent comparison studies, we cannot draw deﬁnite conclusions
on the origin of these diﬀerences.

Figure 10, panel c shows the comparison of microturbulent
velocities. Both the correlation of literature and present values,
as well as the agreement between literature values of diﬀerent
studies is poor. In the case of HD 191243, a maximum diﬀerence
of ∆ξ = 13 km s−1 is found between Markova & Puls (2008) and
our work on the one hand and Searle et al. (2008) on the other.
Overall, our assessments of microturbulent velocity are system-
atically lower by ∼10 km s−1 than the literature values, with the
exception of Markova & Puls (2008). While our microturbulent
velocities remain subsonic, literature values are often found to be
supersonic. Such systematically lower microturbulent velocities
were also found in previous work on B-type main-sequence stars
(Nieva & Przybilla 2012), where a broad variety of microturbu-
lence indicators were employed versus the usual reliance on the
Si iii 4552–4574 Å triplet alone. We note that microturbulence
velocities were not provided by Simón-Díaz et al. (2017).

Finally, a comparison of projected rotational velocities is
shown in Figure 10, panel d. Good agreement is achieved overall,
though there are some small-scale diﬀerences between the com-
pared works. Values by Simón-Díaz et al. (2017) agree very well
with ours, showing little to no oﬀset and small scatter, while val-
ues derived in this work are systematically larger by ∼4 km s−1
in comparison with data of Fraser et al. (2010). The only sig-
niﬁcant outlier is the (cid:51) sin i-value of HD 191243 in the work by
Markova & Puls (2008), which is likely a statistical outlier, given
the good accordance of the corresponding value in Simón-Díaz
et al. (2017).

5.3. Elemental abundances and stellar metallicity

The mean abundances of all the metal species studied here
(which constitute the ten most abundant elements besides hydro-
gen and helium) along with their uncertainties and the number of
analysed lines are summarised in Table 6. In addition, the result-
ing metallicities of the sample stars are shown. For a conserva-
tive estimate of the error margins the 1σ sample standard devi-
ation of individual line abundances was chosen, as tests on sin-
gle line statistical uncertainty resulted in unreasonably low mar-
gins. In general, these statistical uncertainties range from ∼0.05–
0.10 dex, and rarely exceed the latter value. The number of lines
analysed per species and object is at least two in very few cases
and usually much larger. Standard errors of the mean therefore
amount to typically 0.02–0.03 dex for the elemental abundances
in each star. Metal mass fractions Z (’metallicities’) of the sam-
ple stars were calculated from the available metal abundances
and are indicated in the last column of Table 6. As these cover
the ten most abundant metal species these should be representa-
tive for the sum of all metals.

The systematic uncertainties depend primarily on the quality
of the respective model atoms and on the uncertainties in eﬀec-
tive temperatures, surface gravities, and microturbulent veloci-
ties, see for example the discussions by Przybilla et al. (2000,
2001a,b) and Przybilla & Butler (2001). Given the experience
gained in these works, we expect the systematic uncertainties of
the elemental abundances to amount to ∼0.1 dex.

The derivation of abundances for all chemical species that
show spectral lines in the optical allowed global synthetic spec-
tra to be calculated, that is one model spectrum based on the
derived atmospheric parameters and abundances per star. This
also includes the blended features that were excluded from the
chemical analysis. As can be expected from the small abundance
uncertainties, the reproduction of the observed spectra by the
global synthetic spectrum is excellent overall, as shown for the
exemplary case of HD 164353 in Appendix A, Figs. A.1 to A.8.
Apart from some occasional very weak features, for instance of
S ii where the model atom would need to be extended to include
more energy levels, all important stellar spectral lines are in-
cluded in the spectrum synthesis. Noticeable omissions are sev-
eral interstellar (’IS’) atomic features, such as the Ca H and K
lines, the Na D lines, a K i resonance line6, the diﬀuse interstel-
lar bands (DIBs), and the telluric absorption features typically
due to O2 and H2O bands that occur with increasing frequency
towards the near-IR. Some residual problems remain for a few
stellar lines, for example the mismatch of the Hα Doppler core,
which is likely caused by the (weak) stellar wind in this object
and not accounted for by the present modelling approach. The
widths of the two strongest He i lines λ5875 and 6678 Å are not
perfectly matched. It would certainly be worthwhile to investi-
gate this further as the widths of all other helium lines are re-
produced well, but this is beyond the scope of the present paper.
A few metal lines also show somewhat larger deviations, such
as the C ii λ6578/82 Å doublet, which may hint at the possibil-
ity that the model atom may need to be improved with respect
to these lines. However, in view of the overall solution these are
minor details, the few discrepant features were not considered
for the analysis.

6 Only the K i λ7698.9 Å line is clearly visible in this case, while the
other ﬁne-structure component K i λ7664.9 Å overlaps with a saturated
telluric O2 line (see e.g. Kimeswenger et al. 2021), which depends on
the radial velocity of the target star.

abundance standard values (Nieva & Przybilla 2012). Objects from
the present work (open symbols), B-type main-sequence stars (Nieva
& Przybilla 2012, black triangles), and BA-type supergiants (Przybilla
et al. 2010, black dots) are compared to predictions from stellar evolu-
tion models. Solid lines: 15 M(cid:12), Ωrot = 0.95 Ωcrit model by Georgy et al.
(2013); dashed lines: 15 M(cid:12), Ωrot = 0.568 Ωcrit model by Ekström et al.
(2012); dotted lines: 25 M(cid:12), Ωrot = 0.568 Ωcrit model by Ekström et al.
(2012). For all tracks, a metallicity of Z = 0.014 was assumed. Abun-
dances in the models were normalised with respect to their initial model
values.

Previous work on abundances of early B-type stars in the so-
lar neighbourhood (distances out to ∼400 pc from the Sun) has
found chemical homogeneity, establishing a present-day cosmic
abundance standard (CAS, Nieva & Przybilla 2012; Przybilla
et al. 2013), see Table 6. Such a comparison of abundances be-
tween the present sample stars and the CAS is inappropriate here
because of the widely diﬀerent distances of the sample objects
from the Galactic centre (see Sect. 5.5), for example ∼7 kpc for
HD 184943 versus ∼13 kpc for HD 25914. For the same rea-
son, an important test to verify the independence of abundances
of atmospheric parameters such as Teﬀ and log g that could be
made by Nieva & Przybilla (2012), cannot be repeated here. We
note, however, that the supergiants closest to the Sun in the sam-
ple, HD 125288 and HD 164353, are consistent with the CAS
values within the mutual uncertainties, but they show overall
larger abundances. In particular the surface abundances of ni-
trogen show clear indication of mixing of the atmospheres with
CN-processed material from the stellar cores.

5.4. Signatures of mixing with CNO-processed material
Diﬀerent physical mechanisms can lead to mixing of CNO-
cycled matter from the stellar core to the surface of rotating
stars. Examples are meridional circulation or shear mixing due to
diﬀerential rotation (e.g Maeder & Meynet 2012; Langer 2012)
further modiﬁed by the presence of magnetic ﬁelds. As a conse-
quence, ratios of the surface carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen mass
fractions, and the helium mass fractions are expected to appear in
relatively narrow regions in diagnostic diagrams (Przybilla et al.
2010; Maeder et al. 2014) as shown in Fig. 11. All ratios were
normalised to the initial values so as to make the comparison to
the evolution tracks easier – the observations were normalised

relative to CAS abundances (see Table 6, Yini = 0.276), the mod-
els to their respective (solar) initial values.

As the N/C versus N/O plot shows little dependence on the
initial stellar masses, rotation velocities, and nature of the mixing
processes up to relative enrichment of N/O by a factor of about
four, it constitutes an ideal quality test for observational results
(Maeder et al. 2014). The CNO signatures of the present sample
supergiants closely follow both the path predicted by models and
the observational data of Przybilla et al. (2010) and Nieva &
Przybilla (2012). This gives conﬁdence that systematic errors in
the present atmospheric parameters are indeed small.

The star HD 159110 (ID #13) appears at CAS initial val-
ues for CNO abundances, while other objects like HD 119646
(ID #11) and HD 51309 (ID #9), and other stars up to
(N/O)/(N/O)ini (cid:46) 3 exhibit CNO abundances found for stars
with mixing signatures on the main sequence. The majority of
the sample stars is noticeably enriched in CN-processed matter,
though the enrichment does not reach the high values observed
for some of the more evolved BA-type supergiants.

The helium abundances follow overall the predicted path
with most objects showing values consistent with the initial he-
lium abundance within 1σ uncertainties. We note that objects
ID#9, #11, and in particular #13 seem to deviate from initial he-
lium values where they are expected to show no modiﬁcation.
This is true when only statistical uncertainties are considered,
which are displayed in Fig. 11. However, potential systematic
errors also need to be considered and we emphasise that the oﬀ-
set of ID#13 from the initial value corresponds to only 0.02 dex.
Such diﬀerences are much smaller than the symbol sizes in the
upper panel of Fig. 11, stressing the enormous changes in mostly
nitrogen (and to a lesser extent carbon and oxygen) abundances
versus the enrichment of helium which is diﬃcult to determine.

The highest helium enrichment found in our sample stars is
about 15% above the initial value. This is diﬀerent to the BA-
type supergiants, which show larger enhancement values. We
note that diﬀerent helium lines were analysed by Przybilla et al.
(2010), as many of the stars are cooler than the present sample
stars. However, investigation of the cause of these diﬀerences is
beyond the scope of the present paper.

5.5. Spectroscopic distances

The spectroscopic distances derived in this work depend on sev-
eral parameters deduced both from the quantitative spectral anal-
ysis and inferred from fundamental parameters on the basis of
stellar evolution models, spectral synthesis codes, and photomet-
ric data (see Eqn. 3). As already mentioned in brief in Sect. 4.4,
the comparison with independent distance estimations (e.g. Gaia
EDR3) can provide valuable insight into systematic problems
in the derivation of important parameters for the entire sam-
ple. It can, however, also highlight individual sample objects
that may have undergone exceptional evolutionary pathways.
Binarity (with and without associated mass transfer) and post-
asymptotic giant branch evolutionary histories can leave signa-
tures detectable in this approach. Regardless as to whether the
star has evolved ’normally’ or not, it may be stated that the pri-
mary sources of uncertainty are evolutionary mass Mevol and sur-
face gravity log g, so that potential oﬀsets in distances most prob-
ably stem from systematically biased parameters.

Figure 12 shows a direct comparison (upper panel) and rela-
tive diﬀerence (lower panel) of our spectroscopic distances dspec
and distances dGaia derived from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. Specif-
ically, dGaia is the ’photogeometric’ Bayesian estimation of dis-
tance by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), which in addition to Gaia

Article number, page 17 of 31

A&A proofs: manuscript no. Bsupergiants

EDR3 parallaxes also takes into account the objects colour and
apparent magnitude to achieve yet higher accuracy. In the di-
rect comparison, we see a good agreement of the two distance
determinations for the individual objects. The relative diﬀer-
ences display a small mean oﬀset of µs = −6% with a sample
standard deviation of σs = 12%, showing the excellent agree-
ment between the distances. Even though most objects lie within
about 2.5 kpc from the Sun, the relationship does not seem to
degrade noticeably at larger distances, as can be seen for the
cases of HD 184943 (ID #6, dspec = 4 kpc) and HD 25914 (ID #3,
dspec = 6 kpc). Two of our sample stars, HD 7902 (ID #1) and
HD 183143 (ID #5), depart somewhat from the mean relation-
ship. While we cannot oﬀer a robust explanation for the discrep-
ancy in distance of either of these objects, we note that both
are evolved stars towards the upper mass limit of our sample.
Small scale systematic errors in mass estimates, as discussed in
Sect. 4.2, are maximised in this region. For ID#1 a mass reduced
by 1 M(cid:12) would be suﬃcient to reach agreement within the mu-
tual 1σ-uncertainties of the two distances. Maximum systematic
eﬀects would be needed for ID#5 in this picture, requiring an
initially non-rotating single star, but at the same time it is one
of the two stars with the largest CNO mixing signature in the
sample. This could possibly be interpreted in terms of a binary
history. However, a further discussion of this is not warranted by
the information available. Considering the oﬀset µs of the rela-
tive diﬀerences is of the order of −0.5σs, we may conclude that
the line of regression is compatible with an oﬀset of zero. It may
on the other hand reﬂect some unaccounted low-scale system-
atics, which, however, have no signiﬁcant impact on the basic
conclusions of the present work.

The distribution of the sample stars in the Galactic disk is
depicted in Fig. 13. The sample objects span Galactocentric dis-
tances in the range of Rg = 7-13 kpc (calculated for a distance of
the Sun to the Galactic centre of 8.178 kpc, Gravity Collabora-
tion et al. 2019), while the range of elevations above and below
the Galactic plane is fairly small, typically within 200 pc. Only
our outermost supergiant, HD 25914 (ID#3), is located ∼0.4 kpc
above the Galactic plane. While the arrangement of the objects
along the spiral arms is not immediately obvious, a closer inspec-
tion using the spiral arm delineation by Xu et al. (2021) shows
that stars with IDs #10, 11, and 13 are located in the Carina-
Sagittarius Arm, #6, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 14 in the Local Arm, #1,
2, and 4 are associated with the Perseus Arm and #3 is situ-
ated in the Outer Arm. Star #5 lies in the Sagittarius-Carina arm
if dGaia is adopted, and otherwise between that and the Local
Arm if dspec is considered.

5.6. Sight lines – reddening law

For the high-precision determination of the interstellar sight
lines to the sample objects, the model Atlas9-SEDs were ﬁt-
ted to photometric observations in various bands as well as to
UV spectrophotometry from the IUE-satellite. Figure 14 exem-
plarily summarises the result of this ﬁtting process for three out
of the 14 sample stars to give an impression of the quality of the
ﬁts, ordered from top to bottom by increasing values of colour
excess E(B − V). For most objects suﬃcient constraining obser-
vations were suitable for comparison and resulted in very small
associated uncertainties in both RV and E(B − V). Values for
RV vary between 2.9 and 3.6, mostly concentrating around the
typical ISM value of 3.1, and reddening values vary typically
between 0.1 and 0.8, see Table 5 for a summary of the results.
The peculiar case of HD 183143 was already brieﬂy discussed
in Sect. 4.3.

Atlas9-SEDs, normalised in V and reddened according to values from
Table 5 (blue lines) are compared to IUE spectrophotometry (grey lines)
and photometric data in various wavelength bands: ANS (circles), TD1
(diamonds), Johnson (squares), 2MASS (triangles), and ALLWISE data
(hexagons). Data with bad quality ﬂags were removed. For better vis-
ibility, the SEDs and photometry of HD 164353 and HD 7902 were
shifted by +1 and −1 dex, respectively.

5.7. Evolutionary status

The evolutionary status of the sample stars can be derived by
comparison to stellar evolution tracks. Two complementary di-
agnostic diagrams may be employed for this, the spectroscopic
HRD (sHRD, log(L /L(cid:12)) versus log Teﬀ, introduced by Langer
& Kudritzki 2014) and the HRD (log L/L(cid:12) versus log Teﬀ). The
sHRD is based only on observed atmospheric parameters (like
the Kiel diagram – log g versus log Teﬀ –, not shown here), while
the HRD requires knowledge of the distance and corrections for
interstellar extinction to be taken into account. Both were de-
rived in the present work and we give preference to spectroscopic
distances. The positions of the sample stars in both diagrams
with respect to evolutionary tracks for rotating stars by Ekström
et al. (2012) are shown in Fig. 15. We note the very similar po-
sitions of the sample stars relative to the evolution tracks. This
is consistent with them likely being post-main-sequence objects
with ZAMS masses between about 9 to 30 M(cid:12) on the ﬁrst cross-
ing of the HRD towards the red supergiant phase (star #13 is a
potential exception, it may alternatively be in the last stages of
core H-burning, depending on its detailed properties). They are
located on the cool side of the bi-stability jump for stellar winds
(e.g. Lamers et al. 1995) and are slowly rotating, with (cid:51) sin i in
the range of about 20 to 50 km s−1, as expected for such B-type
supergiants (see e.g. Vink et al. 2010). Evolutionary ages vary
between about 7 Myr for the most massive to about 29 Myr for
the least massive sample objects, as inferred from isochrones in-
dicated in the upper panel of Fig. 15. We emphasise again that
the masses and ages are derived assuming that the particular ro-
tation rates in evolution models and isochrones are representa-
tive on average for the sample. Systematic shifts in mass and age
result if the initial rotational velocities had other values, but we
expect them to be covered by our uncertainties in most cases.

We note that the sample stars show a variety of metallicities
(see Table 6) because of their diﬀerent positions in the Galactic
disk. The most metal-poor star in the present work is HD 25914

at Z = 0.011 in the Outer Arm, while several objects reach super-
CAS metallicities in the inner Milky Way, up to Z = 0.020, that
is the variations reach up to about 20% below and 40% above
the CAS value. Moreover, the chemical composition of the sam-
ple stars varies from (scaled) solar, as implemented by Ekström
et al. (2012) for the Z = 0.014 models, to the bracketing analo-
gous Z =0.006 (Eggenberger et al. 2021) and Z = 0.020 models
(Yusof et al. 2022). The net eﬀects are a more eﬃcient trans-
port of angular momentum and CNO-processed material with
decreasing metallicity and a higher mass-loss with increasing
metallicity. However, we do not see the resulting diﬀerences as
critical for the present work in terms of parameters deduced from
the comparison such as ZAMS or evolutionary masses. The evo-
lutionary tracks remain similar throughout the metallicity range
(see e.g. Yusof et al. 2022, their Fig. 5), such that the resulting
systematics are expected to lie within our uncertainties.

The number of sample stars is too low to investigate the ef-
fects responsible for the mixing of the surface layers with CNO-
processed material from the core systematically. Two ﬁndings
are in line with the general picture of rotational mixing: the two
stars with CNO signatures closest to the pristine values (#11,
#13) are closest to the terminal-age main sequence, towards
lower masses, and the stars showing the highest processing (#5,
#6, and #8) are the most evolved (i.e. showing the coolest tem-
peratures) and tend to be among the most massive sample stars.
On the other hand, star #3 – the most massive and most metal-
poor object of the sample – shows only a milder degree of chemi-
cal mixing, which may be the consequence of an initially slower
rotation than average. The issue has to be revisited based on a
much larger sample of objects.

6. Test for extragalactic applications at intermediate

spectral resolution

High-resolution spectroscopy of B-type supergiants as presented
here can be conducted in galaxies beyond the Magellanic Clouds
only at the cost of long exposure times of the order of hours on
large telescopes (e.g. Urbaneja et al. 2011). Fortunately, many of
the stronger diagnostic lines are isolated, so that intermediate-
resolution spectroscopy (R (cid:39) 1000–5000) suﬃces to allow quan-
titative analyses, at the loss of only the weaker spectral lines.
This also opens up the possibility of employing multi-object
spectroscopy, in particular when investigating galaxies beyond
the Local Group, providing multiplexing of the order a few
tens to hundreds of objects to be observed simultaneously. This
comprises various successful techniques that have been imple-
mented already as multi-slit spectroscopy (e.g. with the FOcal
Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2, FORS2, on the ESO
Very Large Telescope VLT, e.g. Kudritzki et al. 2016), multi-
ﬁbre spectroscopy (with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fi-
bre Spectroscopic Telescope, LAMOST, e.g. Liu et al. 2022) or
integral-ﬁeld spectroscopy (as with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer, MUSE, on the VLT, e.g. González-Torà et al. 2022).

Isolated spectral lines of H, He, C, N, O, Mg, and Si, or pure
blends thereof, are strong enough to allow atmospheric parame-
ters and individual elemental abundances to be constrained even
at intermediate spectral resolution. The blue spectral region from
the Balmer jump to about 5000 Å is particularly useful for anal-
yses, preferentially towards the earlier B spectral types, as they
show stronger and a larger number of metal lines, see Fig. 1.
The comparison of the ﬁnal synthetic spectrum and the observed
spectrum for the hottest of the sample stars in two extended blue
spectral windows is shown in Fig. 16. The same comparison,

however for an artiﬁcially downgraded R = 1000 reachable with
FORS2, is shown in the lower subpanels, where a S /N = 50 is
simulated for the observation. Excellent agreement is achieved
in both cases, except for some small details. Moreover, modiﬁed
models by ±1000 K in Teﬀ and ±0.3 dex in metal abundances
are also shown in the intermediate-resolution case. This shows
that a simultaneous evaluation of all the spectral features, both
the atmospheric parameters (log g is constrained by the response
of the Balmer lines, not shown here) as well as the elemen-
tal abundances can be performed using χ2 minimisation tech-
niques in the multi-parameter space, with uncertainties that are
only slightly larger than in the high-resolution case: ∆Teﬀ in the
range of about 300-1000 K, ∆ log g of about 0.10 dex, and ele-
mental abundances in the range of about 0.10 to 0.15 dex. We
note in particular that the ionisation equilibria Si ii/iii(/iv), and
in the case that red wavelengths are also covered O i/ii, remain
available at intermediate resolution. The microturbulent veloc-
ity can best be constrained from the rather numerous Si ii/iii and
O i/ii lines (in contrast to the minimalistic approach of concen-
trating only on the Si iii triplet 4552-4574 Å, e.g. Hunter et al.
2007).

We conclude that the present hybrid non-LTE spectrum syn-
thesis technique based on reliable model atoms allows for com-
prehensive quantitative analyses of B-type supergiants on the ba-
sis of intermediate-resolution spectra. This opens up the prospect
of B-type supergiants as versatile tools to address a number of

highly-relevant astrophysical topics in the context of extragalac-
tic stellar astronomy.

Even with available instrumentation on the current genera-
tion of 8-10m telescopes, a wide range of detailed studies, in
particular concerning galactic evolution (galactic abundance gra-
dients, the galaxy mass-metallicity relationship, e.g. Urbaneja
et al. 2005a; Kudritzki et al. 2012, 2014; Castro et al. 2012) and
the cosmic distance scale (via application of the FGLR, e.g. Ur-
baneja et al. 2017), can be addressed by investigating supergiants
in galaxies in the ﬁeld and in the nearby galaxy groups. With
the advent of the Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), the step
to investigate supergiants in galaxies in the nearby Virgo and
Fornax galaxy clusters will become feasible, allowing environ-
mental eﬀects to be studied. However, as adaptive optics tech-
niques will be required to reach the full potential of the ELTs
in terms of spatial resolution, spectroscopic observations will

have to concentrate on redder wavelength regions, at least ini-
tially. For example, the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Op-
tical and Near-infrared Integral ﬁeld spectrograph (HARMONI,
Thatte et al. 2021) on the ESO ELT will cover wavelengths be-
yond 4700 Å and the multi-object spectrograph MOSAIC (Ham-
mer et al. 2021) beyond 4500 Å. The information content will be
lower than at bluer wavelengths, but suitable spectral lines for
analyses are present, see the ﬁgures in Appendix A. Important
for the scientiﬁc return will be to achieve wide wavelength cov-
erage.

7. Summary and conclusions

A hybrid non-LTE spectrum synthesis approach for quantitative
analyses of luminous B-type supergiants with masses up to about
30 M(cid:12) was presented, where most spectral lines are formed in a

photosphere that is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the stellar wind.
It was shown that practically the entire observed optical to near-
IR high-resolution spectra can be reliably reproduced, including
the dozen chemical elements with the highest abundances. The
modelling was thoroughly tested for 14 sample objects spanning
a Teﬀ-range from about 12 000 to 20 000 K (i.e. spectral types
B8 to B1.5) and luminosity classes II, Ib, Iab, and Ia. The present
work helps to connect the region of late O- and early B-type stars
on the main-sequence with luminosity classes V to III (Nieva &
Przybilla 2012, 2014) and the cooler BA-type supergiants (Przy-
billa et al. 2006a; Firnstein & Przybilla 2012), which will allow
stellar evolution to be tracked observationally throughout the hot
regime of the HRD in a homogeneous manner.

Due to the highly interactive and iterative nature of the ap-
proach, the time required to carry out the analysis procedure for
a comprehensive solution of one sample object amounts to typi-
cally 2 weeks for experienced users. For a demonstration of the
applicability of a method and a ﬁrst application, this is an ac-
ceptable time investment. But, obviously, a combination of the
models with faster, more automatised state-of-the-art analysis
techniques (see e.g. Sect. 3.8 of Simón-Díaz 2020) is required
for future larger-scale applications.

It has been shown that the atmospheric parameters of B-type
supergiants can be determined with high precision and accu-
racy using the hybrid non-LTE approach. The eﬀects of turbulent
pressure were taken into account for the ﬁrst time for B-type su-
pergiants, and they lead to (small) systematic shifts in the atmo-
spheric parameters. Eﬀective temperatures can be constrained to
2-3% uncertainty, surface gravities to better than 0.07 dex un-
certainty, and elemental abundances with uncertainties of 0.05
to 0.10 dex (statistical 1σ-scatter) and about 0.1 dex (systematic
error). Classical LTE analyses that can be partly successful for
the analysis of main-sequence stars at similar Teﬀ cannot be ex-
pected to yield any meaningful results for supergiant analyses
(Fig. 4 gives an impression of the diﬀerences).

Precise and accurate atmospheric parameters also allow an
improved characterisation of the interstellar reddening and the
reddening law along the sight lines towards the supergiants to be
made. The importance of B-type supergiants in this context lies
in their large luminosities, so that sight lines to very distant parts
of the Milky Way may become traceable in the era of large spec-
troscopic surveys (e.g. Xiang et al. 2022). A comparison with
stellar evolution models then also allows the fundamental pa-
rameters to be determined. In particular future Gaia data releases
will help to further reduce the uncertainties for Galactic super-
giants by providing stronger astro- and photometric constraints
to cross-check resulting spectroscopic solutions.

Most of the sample stars show signatures of the surface lay-
ers having experienced (rotational) mixing with CNO-processed
material from the core, and the positions of the stars in the HRD
are consistent with hydrogen shell-burning being active but core
He-burning probably having not yet ignited (which happens for
the investigated mass range earliest at log Teﬀ (cid:39) 4.1, and cooler,
according to the models of Ekström et al. 2012). Unlike main-
sequence early B-type stars in the solar neighbourhood (Nieva &
Przybilla 2012), the B-supergiant sample does not show chem-
ical homogeneity for the heavier elements. However, this is not
unexpected, as the objects cover a wider range of Galactocen-
tric distances, that is they will be subject to Galactic abundance
gradients (e.g. Méndez-Delgado et al. 2022).

Finally, it was shown that the full spectrum synthesis ap-
proach makes applications to intermediate-resolution spectra
possible, with only slightly increased error margins. Extragalac-
tic samples of B- and A-type supergiants below the ∼30 M(cid:12)

limit can therefore be analysed homogeneously in the future.
A major step for such applications will be reached once multi-
object spectrographs on ELTs become available. Quantitative
spectroscopy of supergiants in the star-forming galaxies of the
Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters can then commence, allowing
galaxy evolution in the diﬀerent environments to be studied – in
the ﬁeld, in groups, and in clusters – in more detail than currently
feasible on the basis of gaseous nebulae.

D. Weßmayer et al.: Quantitative spectroscopy of B-type supergiants

Appendix A: Example of a global model ﬁt

The following ﬁgures show a comparison of the spectrum of
HD 164353 as observed with FEROS and the best ﬁtting global
synthetic spectrum. The model was computed with the codes At-
las12/Detail/Surface on basis of atmospheric parameters and
elemental abundances for the star as summarised in Tables 5
and 6, respectively. The diagnostic stellar lines are identiﬁed in
Figs. A.1 to A.8. A few interstellar (’IS’) lines – the Ca H+K,
Na D and K i resonance lines – and several diﬀuse interstel-
lar bands (DIBs) are also identiﬁed, but they are missing in the
model. Numerous sharp unmodelled features redwards of about
5870 Å are of telluric origin, due to H2O or from the O2 A-, B-
and γ-bands.
