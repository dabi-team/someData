Abstract: 

Tunable metasurfaces provide a compact and efficient strategy for optical components 

that require active wavefront shaping.  Varifocal metalens is one of the most important 

applications.  However,  the  existing  tunable  metalens  rarely  serves  broadband 

wavelengths restricting their applications in broadband imaging and color display due 

to chromatic aberration. Herein, we demonstrate an electrically tunable polarization-

multiplexed varifocal  achromatic dielectric metalens integrated with twisted nematic 

liquid  crystals  (TNLCs)  in  the  visible  region.  The  phase  profiles  at  different 

wavelengths  under  two  orthogonal  polarization  channels  are  customized  by  the 

particle  swarm  optimization  algorithm  and  optimally  matched  with  the  metaunits 

database  to  achieve  polarization-multiplexed  dispersion  manipulation  including 

achromatic performance. By combining the broadband linear polarization conversion 

ability  of  TNLC,  the  tunability  of  varifocal  achromatic  metalens  is  realized  by 

applying  different  voltages.  Further,  the  electrically  tunable  customized  dispersion-

manipulated  metalens  and  switchable  color  metaholograms  are  demonstrated.  The 

proposed devices will accelerate the application of  metasurfaces  in  broadband  zoom 

imaging, AR/VR displays, and spectral detection.

Introduction  

Metasurfaces  are  planar  optical  elements  composed  of  scatterers  with 

subwavelength  sizes  arranged  on  a  two-dimensional  plane.  By  adjusting  the  shape, 

size, position and orientation of the scatterers, almost arbitrary control of the phase[1], 

amplitude[2],  polarization[3]  and  frequency[4]  of  light  can  be  achieved.  With  such 

ability of multi-parameter modulation, large-volume single-function refractive optical 

elements  can  be  designed  into  ultrathin  and  multifunctional  elements[5].  Various 

metasurface-based  devices  have  been  demonstrated,  such  as  metalenses[6,  7], 

metaholograms[8-10],  vectorial  beam  generators[11,  12],  structural  color[4,  13]  and 

nonlinear  optical  metasurfaces[14,  15].  Due  to  the  strong  demand  for  integrated  and 

miniature  optical  components  in  zoom  imaging,  optical  displays  and  light  detection 

and ranging (LiDAR) systems, actively tunable metasurfaces have attracted extensive 

attention and research[16]. Various tuning mechanisms have been proposed, such as the 

use of phase-change materials[17, 18], mechanical actuation[19, 20], free carrier effects[21, 

22],  chemical 

reactions[23]  and 

surrounding  environment  manipulation[24-26]. 

Particularly, liquid crystals (LCs) are widely used to implement tunable metasurfaces 

due to their unique birefringence properties and mature control mechanisms[25, 27]. 

Varifocal  metalens  is  one  of  the  important  applications  of  tunable  metasurfaces 

and is  expected to  replace bulky  refractive  optical  elements. However,  most  tunable 

metalenses  operate  at  a  single  wavelength,  and  dispersion  limits  their  practical 

applications in fields such as broadband imaging and color displays[26, 28]. Dispersion 

is a fundamental property of materials, which causes chromatic aberration in imaging. 

 
The  conventional  dispersion  manipulation  requires  the  superposition  of  several 

components[29],  resulting  in  a  bulky  and  complex  system.  The  units  of  metasurfaces 

have a higher degree of design freedom[30-32], which opens up the possibility of using 

a  single  lightweight  metasurfaces  to  control  dispersion.  So  far,  some  strategies  for 

multi-wavelength  or broadband  metasurfaces have been proved by using multi-layer 

metasurfaces[33],  interleaved  structures[34]  and  phase  compensation[35,  36].  The  phase 

compensation  method  can  achieve  achromatic  performance  with  a  non-interleaved 

metaunit, but it rarely combines with other parameters (e.g., polarization) to achieve 

multi-channel  dispersion  manipulation.  In  addition,  the  method  of  combining 

dispersion manipulation with existing tunable mechanisms is still to be explored.  

In  this  work,  we  demonstrate  an  electrically  tunable  polarization-multiplexed 

achromatic dielectric metalens (TPAM) integrated with twisted nematic liquid crystals 

(TNLCs)  in  the  visible  region.  Vertical  stacking  of  metalens  and  TNLCs  offers  a 

simpler device preparation process and control mechanisms. A single non-interleaved 

rectangular composite structure is used as a metaunit and its phase response database 

is constructed to provide diverse phase dispersion. The phase profile of the metalens 

is  optimized  by  the  particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO)  algorithm  to  minimize 

matching  error  in  phase  compensation.  This  makes  it  possible  to  obtain  better 

matching results with less structural data, which greatly saves computing power. With 

the  broadband  linear  polarization  conversion  ability  of  TNLC,  the  zooming  of 

polarization-multiplexed  achromatic  metalens  can  be  realized  by  applying  different 

voltages. Finally, we show the electrically tunable customized dispersion-manipulated 

 
metalens and switchable color metaholograms to further demonstrate that our design 

is promising for spectral imaging and color display. 

Results and Discussion 

Figure 1 shows the schematic of the proposed TPAM. The main structures of the 

device  are  vertically  stacked  metalens  and  TNLCs.  The  building  blocks  of  upper 

metalens  are  high-aspect-ratio  birefringent  titanium  dioxide  (TiO2)  nanostructures 

(height  of  1000  nm  and  minimum  width  of  60  nm)  with  different  cross-sectional 

shapes.  The  underlying  TNLC  cell  is  composed  of  two  orthogonally  oriented 

photoalignment  layers  with  TNLC  molecules  in  between.  When  there  is  no  applied 

electric  field,  the  linearly  polarized  light  that  is  vertically  incident  and  whose 

polarization direction is parallel to the direction of the first photoalignment layer will 

deflect  90¬∞  along  the  twisting  direction  of  the  LC  molecules  during  the  process  of 

passing through the TNLC cell. When a voltage higher than the threshold voltage is 

applied  to  the  TNLC,  the  long  axes  of  the  LC  molecules  start  to  incline  in  the 

direction  of  the  electric  field.  When  the  applied  voltage  is  large  enough,  except  the 

molecules  close  to  the  photoalignment  layers  are  anchored,  the  long  axes  of  other 

molecules  will  tend  to  be  rearranged  in  the  direction  parallel  to  the  electric  field, 

resulting  in  the  disappearance  of  the  polarization  conversion  of  the  LC  molecules. 

Since  this  optical  rotation  of  LC  is  independent  of  wavelength,  the  TNLC  cell  can 

work  in  a  broadband  range.  Therefore,  the  TPAM  can  achieve  zoom  imaging  by 

applying different  voltages.  The designed  TPAM based on  the  LC  electric drive has 

the  characteristics  of  ultrathin  and  tunable  focal  length,  which  can  be  applied  in 

 
compact and lightweight imaging devices. 

Figure  1.  Schematic  of  the  electrically  tunable  polarization-multiplexed  achromatic 

dielectric  metalens  (TPAM).  The  TPAM  is  integrated  by  twisted  nematic  liquid  crystals 

(TNLCs)  with  all-dielectric  metalens.  The  upper  metalens  is  constructed  of  high-ratio 

birefringent TiO2 nanostructures with different cross-sectional shapes. The underlying layer is 

a  thin  TNLC  cell  containing  two  orthogonally  oriented  photoalignment  layers  for  the  pre-

alignment of LC molecules. By applying different voltages to the TNLC cell, the orientation of 

LC  molecules  is  adjusted  to  realize  the  conversion  of  linearly  polarized  light.  Achromatic 

zoom imaging at different voltages is experimentally demonstrated. 

To  achieve  polarization-multiplexed  dispersion  manipulation,  it  is  necessary  to 

BiasV1f = f2P1:10Vf = f11:2Image 
 
design  independent  phase  profiles  at  all  design  wavelengths  under  different 

polarizations.  Each  birefringent  metaunit  should  provide  a  polarization-multiplexed 

phase response at a specific location in the metalens to satisfy the phase requirements 

for all design wavelengths. The phase response can be expressed as ùúëùë¢ =

2ùúã

ùúÜ

ùëõùëíùëìùëìùêª by 

the waveguiding effect[37], where ùëõùëíùëìùëì is the effective refractive index related with the 

intrinsic refractive index and cross-section shape of the metaunit, ùúÜ is the wavelength 

and ùêª is the height of the metaunit. The phase response under different polarizations 

ùë•,ùë¶ can be modulated by adjusting and the size of metaunits parallel to the incident 

ùúëùë¢

polarization.  It can be seen that for the metaunit with a determined shape, the phase 

response is positively correlated with the wavenumber (

2ùúã

ùúÜ

) and the exact relationship 

is  determined  by  the  effective  refractive  index.  For  a  conventional  converging 

spherical  metalens  with  focal  length  ùëì ,  its  phase  profile  has  to  follow[38] ùúëùëö1 =

‚àí

2ùúã

ùúÜ

(‚àöùëü2 + ùëì2 ‚àí ùëì),  where ùúÜ is  the  design  wavelength,  and ùëü is  the  radial  distance 

from the metalens center. Figure 2a depicts the required spatial phase profiles (phase 

dispersion)  of  the  metalens  for  three  design  wavelengths.  Obviously,  the  required 

phase  response  ùúëùëö1  at  selected  locations  is  inversely  related  to  the  wavenumber, 

which  cannot  be  achieved  with  the  metaunits,  as  shown  in  the  inset  of  Figure  2a. 

Therefore,  the  achromatic  metalens  schemes  in  the  previous  works[36, 39] are  to  shift 

the phase profile upward and intersect at reference position ùëü0, as shown in Figure 2b. 

The  phase  profile  can  be  expressed  as ùúëùëö2 = ‚àí

2ùúã

ùúÜ

(‚àöùëü2 + ùëì2 ‚àí ‚àöùëü0

2 + ùëì2).  In  this 

case, the phase dispersion transforms into a positive correlation at a location smaller 

than ùëü0 ,  thus  providing  the  possibility  of  phase  compensation  through  metaunits. 

 
However,  since  the  introduction  of ùëü0 establishes  a  fixed  linear  relationship  between 

phase  and  wavenumber,  it  can  only  approximate  linearly  to  phase  dispersion  of  the 

metaunit, as shown in the inset of Figure 2b. Moreover, since the choice of metaunit 

database  is  limited,  it  will  introduce  a  larger  matching  error  for  polarization-

multiplexed  achromatic  metalens.  Therefore,  to  achieve  a  better  match  between  the 

dispersion  of  metalens  and  the  nonlinear  dispersion  of  metaunits,  we  adopted  an 

optimized method to construct the phase profile of metalens, as shown in Figure 2c. 

The phase profile we constructed can be expressed as  

ùúëùëö3 = ‚àí

2ùúã

ùúÜ

(‚àöùëü2 + ùëì2 ‚àí ‚àöùëüŒª

2 + ùëì2) 

(1) 

the ùëüùúÜ we chose here is a wavelength-dependent value, and the specific value can be 

obtained by the PSO algorithm. When the x- and y-polarization are multiplexed, the 

matching  error  between  the  response  phase  of  the  metaunit  and  the  phase  profile  of 

the lens at N design wavelengths can be expressed as 

ùë•,ùë¶
ùê∏ùëüùëüùëúùëü = ‚àë ‚àë |ùúëùëö3

ùëñ (ùúÜùëò)|

(2) 

Through  the  iterative  optimization  of  the  PSO  algorithm,  the  metaunits  with  the 

smallest matching error are found to construct a metalens. In this way, the constructed 

metalens  phase  dispersion  is  close  to  that  of  the  metaunit,  as  shown  in  the  inset  of 

Figure 2c. Figure 2d shows the matching results of phase dispersion in the above three 

phase profile construction methods and metaunit phase dispersion under phase folding 

to 0-2œÄ. The phase profile of each design wavelength is shifted by different amounts 

at  the  same  focal  point,  meaning  that  we  can  construct  arbitrary  dispersion 

manipulation  of  the  metalens  to  accurately  match  metaunit  dispersion  under  dual-

 
 
 
 
polarization channels. 

The  phase  dispersion  of  metaunit  is  highly  correlated  with  their  cross-sectional 

shape, providing a new degree of freedom for dispersion manipulation of metalens. In 

order to obtain the required phase compensation under orthogonal linear polarization,  

considering  the  reliability  and  simplicity  of  fabrication,  four  types  of  TiO2 

nanostructures  with  rectangular  composite  cross-sectional  were  employed  as  the 

building blocks of metalens to achieve polarization sensitivity, as shown in Figure 2e. 

TiO2  is  a  kind  of  dielectric  material  with  a  high  refractive  index  in  the  visible 

range, which can achieve  a  larger  range  of  dispersion  at  a  lower  nanometer  scale. 

Figure  2f  and  2g  show  the  phase  response  database  of  the  nanostructures  with 

different parameters under x- and y-polarization, respectively. Details of the metaunit 

phase  response  simulation  can  be  found  in  Supporting  Information  Section  1.  Each 

yellow dot represents the phase response of a specifically designed nanostructure, and 

the red dots represent the required phase of metalens constructed according to Eq. (1), 

with coordinates corresponding to the folded realized phase at 450, 532 and 635 nm. 

Only  three  wavelengths  are  considered  here  to  simplify  the  design.  All  of  the  data 

points form a cloud of dots that scatter across the 2ùúã √ó 2ùúã √ó 2ùúã phase space. Folding 

the phase to 0-2œÄ simplifies the phase space and avoids the one-to-one relationship of 

the unfolded phase.  Figure 2h and 2i show the projection of the metaunit phase and 

the  required  metalens  phase  at  coordinates  532  nm  and  635  nm  under  x-  and  y-

polarization,  respectively.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  required  phase  constructed  by  the 

previous  achromatic  metalens  scheme  cannot  all  find  the  corresponding  metaunit 

 
phase to match, as shown in the upper panels of Figure 2h and 2i. This is because the 

constructed  database  is  limited  and  cannot  fill  the  entire  phase  space.  After 

constructing the phase using Eq. (1) and optimizing ùëüùúÜ at different wavelengths using 

the  PSO  algorithm,  virtually  all  required  metalens  phases  can  be  matched  with  a 

specific metaunit, as shown in the lower panels of Figure 2h and 2i. Figure 2j and 2k 

show  the  matching  results  in  the  radius  dimension  for  different  wavelengths  of  the 

metalens with a radius of 20 Œºm under x- and  y-polarization, respectively. The solid 

line  is  the  constructed  wavefront  phase  profiles  and  the  dots  are  the  phase  of  the 

matched  metaunits.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  matched  metaunits  can  approximately 

realize the constructed phase of the polarization-multiplexed achromatic metalens.

Figure  3a  shows  the  detailed  working  principle  of  the  TPAM.  The  proposed 

TPAM  device‚Äôs  architecture consists of  ultrathin  metalens  with LC  molecules 

confined to a  glass  cavity.  The  metalens  is  constructed  by  high-aspect-ratio  TiO2 

nanofins on a quartz substrate. The two ends of the TNLC cell are the ITO electrodes 

and the orthogonally oriented photoalignment layers. LC molecules are arranged in a 

twisted  manner  due  to  the  anchoring  effect  of  the  photoalignment  layer.  When  the 

 
input  voltage  is  0V,  the  TNLC  cell  converts  linear  y-polarization  to  x-polarization. 

When  a  higher  voltage  is  input  at  about  5V,  the  TNLC  cell  did  not  have  any 

polarization conversion. Therefore, the TPAM device produces a tunable modulation 

performance  under  the  same  incident  light  polarization  conditions.  To  prove  the 

concept,  we prepared a  sample for  tunable  achromatic zoom imaging.  The designed 

electrically tunable dual-polarization channels achromatic metalens (40 Œºm diameter) 

has  a  focal  length  of  50  Œºm  under  x-polarization  and  100  Œºm  under  y-polarization, 

and  the  resulting  NAs  are  0.371  and  0.196,  respectively.  The  device  is  mainly 

prepared by electron-beam lithography (EBL), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and LC 

packaging.  Details  of  the  fabrication  processes  and  parameters  can  be  found  in 

Supporting Information Section 2.  The top-view and oblique-view scanning electron 

microscope (SEM) images of the fabricated metalens are shown in Figure 3b and 3c. 

Figure 3d shows the picture of the TPAM device with electrode leads. The fabricated 

TPAM  device  was  measured  using  the  optical  experimental  setup  in  Supporting 

Information  Section  3  to  characterize  the  focusing  and  imaging  performance.  The 

focal point spread functions at six wavelengths along the propagation direction (z-axis) 

were measured with 1 Œºm resolution (Figure 3e and f). The focal spot profiles and the 

normalized intensity profiles for each wavelength are shown in Figure 3e and f. The 

focal point becomes larger as the focal length increases or the wavelength increases. It 

can  be  seen  that  although  the  tunable  varifocal  achromatic  metalens  is  designed  at 

discrete  three  wavelengths,  it  can  still  achieve  achromatic  performance  from  450  to 

650 nm.  The emergence of the secondary focus  is  due to  some matching  errors  and 

 
processing errors.

height (FWHM) at the focus plane divided by the whole intensity at the focus plane.

The orange line is the focal length of the device when 0V is applied, and the blue line 

is  the  focal  length  of  the  device  when  5V  is  applied.  The  shift  of  the  focus  in  the 

experiment  is  due  to  the  processing  error.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  designed  TPAM 

device achieves achromatic focusing while also having high focusing efficiency in the 

operation band. This is due to the small matching error and the high transmission of 

TiO2 throughout the visible. To demonstrate the performance of achromatic imaging, 

we fabricated a dual-polarization channels chromatic metalens using the same method 

and  compared  its  imaging  performance  with  the  designed  TPAM  device.  The 

chromatic metalens (sample details can be found in Supporting Information Section 4) 

was designed for red light (Œª = 635 nm) with the same diameter and focal length as 

our achromatic sample. Figure 4c and d show the imaging performance of a standard 

1951 United States Air Force (USAF) resolution target from the achromatic metalens 

and chromatic metalens illuminated by a halogen light source at various wavelengths 

and  white  light  illumination  at  0V  and  5V,  respectively.  The  optical  experimental 

setup is shown in Supporting Information Section 3 and the achromatic zoom imaging 

process is shown in Supporting Video. In the measurements, the target and the image 

plane  were  respectively  set  as  a  fixed  plane  for  all  the  wavelengths  to  evaluate  the 

achromatic  performance  of  the  TPAM  device.  It  can  be  seen  that  due  to  the  strong 

chromatic effect, the line edges in the image taken with the chromatic metalens appear 

in multiple colors, resulting in blurred image features. The color difference is mainly 

from  the  efficiency  variation  of  the  fabricated  chromatic  metalens.  In  contrast,  the 

image taken with the TPAM device exhibits clear line features, showing the chromatic 

 
effect is completely eliminated.

In order to further demonstrate the practicality of the optimized metalens scheme 

for  dispersion  manipulation,  we  designed  and  fabricated  a  metalens  device  with 

customized  dispersion  relationships.  When  y-polarized  light  is  incident,  this  device

at  each  wavelength  for  the  desired  focus,  where  the  optimized  metalens  scheme 

provides  great  freedom  to  design  each  wavefront.  The  designed  customized 

dispersion-manipulated metalens has a diameter of 40 Œºm and a focal length at 0V of 

60 Œºm at 450 nm, 80 Œºm at 532 nm, 100 Œºm at 635 nm and a focal length at 5V of 100 

Œºm  at  450  nm,  80  Œºm  at  532  nm,  60  Œºm  at  635  nm.  Figure  5a  and  b  show  the 

measured intensity distribution along the propagation direction, focal spot profiles and 

normalized  intensity  profiles  for  the  customized  dispersion-manipulated  metalens  at 

three  incident  wavelengths  under  different  voltages.  Figure  5c  shows  the  measured 

focal  length  at  designed  wavelengths.  The  orange  line  is  the  focal  length  of  the 

positive  dispersion  when  0V  is  applied,  and  the  blue  line  is  the  focal  length  of  the 

negative  dispersion  when  5V  is  applied.  The  black  line  is  the  negative  dispersion 

reference curve for the measured chromatic metalens. It can be seen that the designed 

metalens  achieve  good  focus  at  each  wavelength  with  significantly  different 

chromatic  aberrations.  Further,  we  demonstrated  the  electrically  switchable  dual-

polarization  channels  color  metaholograms  operating  at  450,  532,  and  635  nm  with 

the  method  of  phase  matching.  The  phase  profiles  of  the  target  image  at  different 

wavelengths  were  retrieved  by  the  Gerchberg-Saxton  algorithm.  The  target  images 

were  well  reconstructed  and  switched  at  different  voltages,  although  the  contrast  is 

reduced due to phase matching errors and processing errors.

The  proposed  dispersion  manipulation  scheme  can  use  optimization  algorithms 

such as the PSO algorithm and genetic algorithm to optimize the phase profile of each 

wavelength  under  different  polarization.  This  makes  it  possible  to  obtain  better 

matching  results  with  less  structural  data.  The  number  of  designed  discrete 

wavelengths can be increased to obtain better achromatic results, but this will increase 

computational complexity. The customized dispersion manipulation capability can be

applied  in  various  applications  such  as  AR/VR  displays  and  spectral  detection.  A 

continuous  zoom  metalens  can  also  be  achieved  through  a  more  refined  design[40]. 

Due to the large degree of freedom of metasurfaces in polarization control, combined 

with the polarization control function of liquid crystals, more tunable devices can be 

realized[41, 42]. 

Conclusion 

In  summary,  we  proposed  a  tunable  broadband  metalens  design  strategy  in  the 

visible region. The vertically stacked integration of metalens and TNLCs provides a 

simpler device fabrication process and control mechanism. The phase profiles of the 

achromatic  metalens  at  each  designed  wavelength  are  optimized  by  the  PSO 

algorithm to minimize matching errors in phase compensation. With this scheme, the 

polarization-multiplexed  achromatic  metalens  composed  of  a  series  of  TiO2 

nanostructures with a high aspect ratio achieves zoom imaging in the range of 450nm 

to  650nm.  Further,  the  electrically  customized  dispersion-manipulated  metalens  and 

switchable  color metaholograms  are demonstrated. The proposed scheme provides a 

great degree of freedom to realize various types of customized dispersion modulation 

and tunable modulation for applications such as AR/VR displays and spectral imaging. 

In  addition,  it  provides  a  new  idea  for  the  realization  of  tunable  broadband 

metasurfaces.
