Background: Large argon-based neutrino detectors, such as those planned for the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment, have the potential to provide unique sensitivity to low-energy (few to tens of MeV) electron neutrinos
produced by core-collapse supernovae. Despite their importance for neutrino energy reconstruction, nuclear de-
excitations following charged-current νe absorption on 40Ar have never been studied in detail at supernova energies.
Purpose: I develop a model of nuclear de-excitations that occur following the 40Ar(νe, e−)40K
reaction. This
model is applied to the calculation of exclusive cross sections.
Methods: A simple expression for the inclusive diﬀerential cross section is derived under the allowed approx-
imation. Nuclear de-excitations are described using a combination of measured γ-ray decay schemes and the
Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. All calculations are carried out using a novel Monte Carlo event generator
called MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields).
Results: Various total and diﬀerential cross sections are presented. Two de-excitation modes, one involving only
γ-rays and the other including single neutron emission, are found to be dominant at few tens-of-MeV energies.
Conclusions: Nuclear de-excitations have a strong impact on the achievable energy resolution for supernova νe
detection in liquid argon. Tagging events involving neutron emission, though diﬃcult, could substantially improve
energy reconstruction. Given a suitable calculation of the inclusive cross section, the MARLEY nuclear de-excitation
model may readily be applied to other scattering processes.

INTRODUCTION

Core-collapse supernovae are exceptionally intense
sources of tens-of-MeV neutrinos and antineutrinos of
In a typical supernova, about 1058 neutri-
all ﬂavors.
nos are released in a burst lasting tens of seconds. Al-
though the ﬁrst observation of supernova neutrinos by
the Kamiokande-II [1], Baksan [2], and Irvine-Michigan-
Brookhaven [3] detectors in 1987 yielded a total of only
two dozen events, the scientiﬁc impact of this dataset has
been tremendous, leading to numerous publications on a
wide variety of subjects [4–9].
In the years since ﬁrst
detection, a worldwide network of large neutrino experi-
ments, most built primarily for other applications, stands
ready to perform a second, high-statistics measurement if
a core-collapse supernova should occur within the galaxy
[10]. Due to the slow rate of galactic core-collapse su-
pernovae (estimated to be about 1.6 per century [11]),
the prospect of such a measurement represents a rare
but valuable opportunity to shed light on the details of
core-collapse and nucleosynthesis, study neutrinos under
extreme conditions, search for evidence of physics beyond
the Standard Model, and explore many other topics [12–
14].

A full realization of the physics potential of the next
galactic core-collapse supernova will require a simultane-
ous measurement of neutrinos of all ﬂavors. While de-
tectors based on water and hydrocarbon scintillator will
primarily detect ¯νe via inverse beta decay (IBD)

which dominates the expected signal at supernova ener-
gies.

Within the decade,

the Deep Underground Neu-
trino Experiment (DUNE) will begin operating four
ten-kiloton liquid argon time projection chambers
(LArTPCs) with the primary goals of studying long-
baseline oscillations of accelerator neutrinos, searching
for proton decay, and measuring the νe ﬂux from a galac-
tic core-collapse supernova if one should occur during the
lifetime of the experiment [17]. Initial studies of the sen-
sitivity of DUNE to supernova neutrinos, performed by
the collaboration itself [15] and by smaller groups (e.g.,
ref. [18]) show promise, and the potential exists for mea-
surements by DUNE of other low-energy neutrinos, no-
tably those produced by the Sun [19].

In addition to DUNE, three sub-kiloton LArTPCs,
SBND [20, 21], MicroBooNE [22], and ICARUS [23], are
currently operating or being installed in the Booster Neu-
trino Beam at Fermilab. A joint eﬀort between the three
experimental collaborations, known as the Short Baseline
Neutrino (SBN) program [24, 25], will perform precision
measurements of neutrino oscillations. In addition to this
primary mission, the SBN detectors will pursue a vari-
ety of other physics measurements and are expected to
be sensitive to supernova neutrinos. To ensure that data
from a core-collapse supernova would be fully recorded
over the ten-second burst, the MicroBooNE collaboration
operates a ﬁrst-of-its-kind continuous readout stream and

 
 
 
 
 
 
has demonstrated its capabilities via reconstruction of
Michel electrons produced by decays of cosmic muons
[26].

While much remains to be done to fully exploit the low-
energy capabilities of LArTPCs, a ﬁrst demonstration
by the ArgoNeuT [27] experiment of reconstruction of
MeV-scale activity due to accelerator-neutrino-induced
neutrons and de-excitation γ-rays achieved a detection
threshold of around 200–300 keV [28]. These encour-
aging initial results have prompted further experimental
work by MicroBooNE [29] and multiple simulation-based
studies considering the implications for reconstruction of
both high- and low-energy physics events [30, 31].

In future analyses of supernova neutrino data, the
event-by-event reconstructed neutrino energy obtained
by each detector will be of primary interest. For IBD
events in water or scintillator, because only a single
hadronic ﬁnal state (a free neutron) is accessible at tens-
of-MeV energies, a measurement of the outgoing positron
energy is suﬃcient to reconstruct the antineutrino energy
with high accuracy. Due to the use of a complex nu-
clear target (argon) in LArTPCs, however, various nu-
clear transitions may occur in response to CC νe absorp-
tion, and thus a one-to-one mapping (up to nuclear re-
coil) between the neutrino and electron energies no longer
exists.

To fully reconstruct the neutrino energy in the argon
case, the reaction Q-value, i.e., the energy imparted to
the nuclear transition, must be inferred by detecting the
nuclear de-excitation products. For transitions to bound
nuclear energy levels, the neutrino energy is in princi-
ple fully recoverable by measuring the energies of all de-
excitation γ-rays in addition to the primary electron. For
transitions to unbound nuclear states, a model is needed
to correct for missing energy associated with undetected
nuclear fragments. In practice, an experimental analysis
that attempts to isolate the simpler bound transitions
will also need a detailed de-excitation model in order to
estimate the purity of the event selection.

With the exception of a recent ﬁrst measurement [32] of
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, experimen-
tal data have not yet been obtained for neutrino-argon
cross sections in the supernova energy regime. Further-
more, only a few measurements with limited precision
are available for low-energy inelastic neutrino scattering
on any nuclear target [33, table 3]. Despite this, a sub-
stantial literature exists for theoretical calculations of the
40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗ process. A review through 2018 is pro-
vided in ref. [34, sec. 7.1], with a notable recent addi-
tion being two publications [35, 36] which employ a Con-
tinuum Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) model
to study this cross section above the nucleon emission
threshold.

While highly useful for providing competing estimates
of event rates in DUNE and other argon-based detec-
tors, all published calculations for this cross section to
date share the limitation of being fully inclusive, i.e.,
predictions are made that consider only the kinematics

2

of the outgoing electron. At very low neutrino energies,
where only transitions to bound nuclear states are pos-
sible, this is not problematic: measured de-excitation γ-
ray branching ratios exist for many levels of the daughter
40K nucleus, and missing data may be addressed using
straightforward theoretical estimates. However, above
about 15–20 MeV, kinematic access to unbound nuclear
states becomes appreciable, and a detailed treatment of
the competition between various de-excitation channels
(including emission of both γ-rays and nuclear fragments)
is needed.

Although such a treatment has not previously been
provided for 40Ar, detailed modeling of nuclear de-
excitations induced by low-energy neutrino interactions
has been pursued for a number of other nuclei [37–42].
A universal assumption made by all of these calculations
(as well as the present work) is that of compound nu-
cleus formation:
following the primary interaction, the
nucleus is left in a thermally-equilibrated excited state
that decays independently of the details of its formation
process. While further work is needed to fully investigate
the adequacy of this assumption for low-energy neutrino-
nucleus reactions, both theoretical calculations [43, 44]
and electron scattering data [45] suggest that compound
processes dominate over the direct nucleon knock-out im-
portant at higher energies.

In this paper, I present the ﬁrst calculations at tens-of-
MeV energies for cross sections for exclusive ﬁnal states
of the reaction 40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗, emphasizing the role of
nuclear de-excitation processes. In section II, I develop a
simple model for the inclusive diﬀerential cross section,
relying on approximations that work best at low momen-
tum transfers. The derivation in section II fully deter-
mines the cross section up to the values of two (Fermi
and Gamow-Teller) nuclear matrix elements, B(F) and
B(GT), which are considered in section III. While rele-
vant neutrino scattering data are currently unavailable,
the needed values of these matrix elements at low ex-
citation energies may be extracted from measurements
of related processes. I supplement these measurements
with the results of a theoretical calculation at high exci-
tation energies to obtain a full treatment of the inclusive
cross section. In section IV, I describe a detailed model
of nuclear de-excitations that can be used together with
the inclusive cross section to obtain predictions for exclu-
sive ﬁnal states. In section V, I present example results
calculated using the models developed in the previous
sections.

To enable practical calculations that have already
helped to inform studies of DUNE’s sensitivity to super-
nova neutrinos [15], all of the physics models described
herein have been implemented in a new Monte Carlo
event generator called MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction
Low Energy Yields). All results shown in this work may
be reproduced using version 1.2.0 of MARLEY [46], which
is publicly available as an open-source software project
[47]. Documentation of the technical details of MARLEY
and usage instructions are available in ref. [48].

Due to the compound nucleus assumption, the MARLEY
de-excitation model may easily be used in the future to
provide exclusive predictions for a more reﬁned calcula-
tion of the inclusive CC νe absorption cross section for
40Ar. A similar approach to modeling de-excitations for
other reaction modes and target nuclei is likewise possi-
ble, and I welcome potential collaboration on this topic.
Prospects for improving MARLEY predictions beyond the
proof-of-concept reported here are brieﬂy considered in
section VI.

the slow-nucleon limit (in which the momentum of the
initial struck nucleon is neglected compared to its mass).

ﬁnal states.

B. Coulomb corrections

[49] is typically used, e.g., in refs. [35, 50, 51].

Under this approach, the Coulomb correction factor
FC that appears in eqs. (4), (23) and (24) is calculated
using either the Fermi function [52, 53] or the modiﬁed
eﬀective momentum approximation (MEMA) [49]. Since
the former is known to overestimate Coulomb corrections
at high lepton energies while the latter does the same at
low energies, the smaller of the two alternatives is always
chosen. This amounts to deﬁning the Coulomb correction
factor as

Final-state interactions (FSIs) of the outgoing charged
lepton with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus have a signif-

allows the use of expressions for FFermi and FMEMA which
are derived in the rest frame of the ﬁnal nucleus. I opt
instead for Lorentz-invariant forms of the correction fac-

Despite sustained community interest and a concrete
proposal by the CAPTAIN experiment [55] to perform
direct measurements, no experimental data for tens-of-
MeV charged-current νe scattering on argon are currently
available. However, in recent decades, three separate ex-
periments have obtained values of the allowed matrix el-
ements B(F) and B(GT) by considering related physics
processes.

The ﬁrst two experiments were performed in the late
1990s by separate teams working at the Gesellschaft f¨ur
Schwerionenforschung (Society for Heavy Ion Research)
in Darmstadt, Germany [56] and the Grand Acc´el´erateur
National d’Ions Lourds (Large Heavy Ion National Ac-
celerator) in Caen, France [57]. Both sought to study
CC νe absorption on 40Ar by measuring beta decays of
its mirror nucleus 40Ti:

40Ti

→

40Sc∗ + e+ + νe .

(35)

In the limit of perfect isospin symmetry, the matrix ele-
ment describing a 40Ti beta decay transition to a speciﬁc
40Sc level is equal to the matrix element accessing the
level’s isobaric analog in 40K via CC νe scattering on
40Ar. The main diﬃculties in applying this technique to
neutrino cross sections are (1) the beta decay Q-value
limits the maximum excitation energy that may be stud-
ied, and (2) energy levels in the beta decay daughter
nucleus (40Sc) must be matched to their analogs in the
ﬁnal-state nucleus for neutrino scattering (40K).

The third experiment [58], performed about a decade
later at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, ex-
tracted B(GT) values from measurements of (p,n) scat-
tering on 40Ar. The extraction technique relied on the ob-
servation, ﬁrst put forward in 1980 [59] and subsequently
reﬁned [60–62], that the (p,n) cross section at very for-
ward angles (θ
0◦) for proton energies around 100 MeV
is approximately proportional to the allowed matrix ele-
ments B(F) and B(GT). While subject to some unique
diﬃculties of its own (see, e.g., ref. [63, sec. 4.2]), this
approach overcomes key limitations of 40Ti beta decay:
transitions to excited levels of 40K may be studied di-
rectly at energies higher than the mirror beta decay Q-
value.

A. Re-evaluation of existing measurements

It should be noted that, as originally presented [49], the
MEMA also involves modifying the value of the momen-
. Since
tum transfer used to evaluate the amplitude
the cross section treatment presented here involves use of
the long-wavelength limit q
0, however, I neglect this

Reasonable attempts were made in the original publi-
cations describing these measurements to assign the ex-
tracted matrix elements to known 40K levels satisfying
the spin-parity selection rules in eqs. (21)–(22). That is,
the 40K isobaric analog state accessed via a Fermi transi-
tion must have J π = 0+, while GT transitions may only
populate levels with J π = 1+. However, in light of new
40K level data that became available in 2017 [64], I re-

Level energies (keV) and spin-parity assignments re-

This scaling was done because the deﬁnition of B(GT)

weak coupling constant gA. The speciﬁc value gA = 1.26
was chosen for consistency with the one assumed in the
experimental analysis.

by the two 40Ti beta decay experiments mentioned pre-
viously. Excitation energies of analog states in 40K, rep-
resented on the horizontal axis, are chosen to match the
assignments made in table I. The vertical axis is inverted
for the second dataset to facilitate comparisons. Rough
consistency is seen between the two measurements, al-
though the results reported by Liu et al. involve several
more nuclear levels.

Figure 2 uses a similar format to individually com-
pare each beta decay measurement to the GT strengths
extracted from (p,n) scattering. Substantially more frag-
mentation of the strength is seen in the beta decay data,
and there are areas of signiﬁcant tension. For instance,
the two experimental methods disagree on whether the
GT strength to the 40K level at 2.3 MeV is larger or
smaller than the strength to the level at 2.7 MeV.

Diﬀerences between the beta decay and (p,n) data were
examined in detail by Karako¸c et al. in 2014 [67]. Based
on a combination of theoretical calculations and a cur-

scattering by Bhattacharya et al. [58].

rently unpublished 40Ar(h, t)40K measurement, the au-
thors argued that the (p,n) data should be preferred over
the 40Ti beta decay data for calculations of CC νe absorp-
tion cross sections on argon. Rather than attempt to ad-
judicate between the conﬂicting datasets, I have opted
to allow each of the three measurements to be used as a
source of B(GT) values in MARLEY cross-section calcula-
tions.

B. Extension to higher excitation energies

Beyond the maximum excitation energy of about
8 MeV probed by the experiments mentioned in the pre-
vious section, the presence of additional Gamow-Teller
strength is predicted by the model-independent Ikeda
sum rule [68]. This rule states that the summed GT
strength S−GT (S+
GT) over all possible nuclear ﬁnal states
for CC νe (¯νe) absorption satisﬁes the relation

e This level is the isobaric analog of the 40Ar ground state.

where Ni = 22 (Zi = 18) is the neutron (proton) num-
ber of the initial 40Ar nucleus. Equation (36) implies
a minimum possible value of S−GT = 12 g2
19 for
the integrated GT strength associated with the reaction
40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗. Comparing this value to the measured
total GT strengths listed in the ﬁnal row of table I re-
veals that the majority of the expected GT strength for
CC νe absorption on 40Ar is unmeasured and associated
with transitions to high-lying, nucleon-unbound states of
40K.

A ≈

To supplement the experimental measurements with
an estimate of the remainder of the GT strength, I rely on
a Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA)
calculation by Cheoun, Ha, and Kajino [69]. To avoid
double-counting, theoretical GT matrix elements are in-
cluded with the experimental ones only for excitation
energies at which the integrated QRPA GT strength ex-
ceeds the experimental total.

IV. NUCLEAR DE-EXCITATION MODEL

8

To model nuclear de-excitations following CC νe ab-
sorption on 40Ar, I rely on the observation that, due
to the selection rules in eqs. (21) and (22), each nu-
clear ﬁnal state accessed by the neutrino interaction has
a well-deﬁned excitation energy, spin, and parity. Dis-
tinct treatments are used for bound and unbound nuclear
states, with the latter being those for which the excita-
tion energy exceeds the separation energy for at least
4. Sep-
one nuclear fragment with mass number A
aration energies are computed in MARLEY using atomic
and particle mass data from refs. [70, 71]. Untabulated
atomic masses are estimated using the liquid drop model
of Myers and Swiatecki [72, 73]. The full de-excitation
cascade is treated as a sequence of binary decays while
neglecting the possibility of ﬁssion and emission of heavy
nucleon clusters (A

C. Adopted matrix elements

A. Bound states: discrete level data

Figure 3 presents three complete sets of allowed
40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗ nuclear matrix elements prepared as in-
put for MARLEY based on the measurements and QRPA
prediction discussed above. The experimental B(GT)
values are shown as green, red, or blue bars depending
on the dataset. The theoretical QRPA B(GT) values are
shown in violet.

In addition to extracting GT strengths, both beta de-
cay experiments measured values of the Fermi matrix el-
ement B(F). Under the approximation that isospin is a
good quantum number, this matrix element is expected
to have the value

B(F) = g2

V (Ni −
and to connect the ground state of 40Ar to a single 0+
isobaric analog state in 40K, which has been identiﬁed as
the level with excitation energy Ex = 4.3837 MeV. Since
the experimental data are fully consistent with these ex-
pectations, I adopt the value B(F) = 4 for this transition
in all three sets of MARLEY matrix elements. The known
Fermi transition is represented in each panel of Figure 3
by a white bar with horizontal hatch marks. Transitions
to all other nuclear levels are assumed to proceed via the
Gamow-Teller operator.

Although the diﬀerences become important at neu-
trino energies near threshold, the observables predicted
in this paper are largely insensitive to the choice be-
tween the three sets of MARLEY matrix elements for the
40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗ reaction. For deﬁniteness, all MARLEY
calculations shown in this work (see section V) are ob-
tained using the ve40ArCC Bhattacharya1998.react in-
put ﬁle, which contains the matrix elements shown in the
middle panel of ﬁg. 3.

De-excitations of bound nuclear states are handled in
MARLEY using a set of nuclear structure data ﬁles orig-
inally prepared for use with version 1.6 of the TALYS
[74–76] nuclear reaction code.1 These in turn are based
on the level schemes included in version 3 of the Ref-
erence Input Parameter Library (RIPL-3) [78]. For a
large number of nuclei, the ﬁles provide tables of discrete
nuclear energy levels including their excitation energies,
spin-parities, and de-excitation γ-ray branching ratios.
Missing experimental measurements of these quantities
are supplemented by theoretical estimates. Although in-
ternal conversion coeﬃcients are provided in the TALYS
data ﬁles, this process is neglected in MARLEY 1.2.0. In
the unusual case where discrete level data are not avail-
able for a particular nuclide, γ-ray emission is simulated
in the same manner as for unbound nuclear states.

The TALYS structure data ﬁles are used with minor
reformatting for all nuclides except 40K. To ensure con-
sistency with the level assignments made in section III A,
I prepared an original decay scheme for 40K using the
experimental data in ref. [64], the TALYS 1.6 structure
ﬁle, and (where needed) estimated γ-ray branching ra-
tios computed using the strength function deﬁned in sec-
tion IV B 3.

1 The current release of TALYS is version 1.95. However, begin-
ning with TALYS 1.8, some nuclear levels for nuclei with an odd
mass number (e.g., 39K) appear in the structure data ﬁles with
an unphysical integer spin (as opposed to a half-integer spin).
This bug, which remains unﬁxed [77], has prevented updates to
the data ﬁles distributed with MARLEY.

legend heading. The QRPA B(GT) strengths (violet) were calculated by Cheoun et al. [69]. Citations for the
experimental B(GT) strengths are given in the captions for ﬁgs. 1 and 2.

B. Unbound states: statistical emission

The MARLEY approach to modeling de-excitations of
unbound nuclear states rests on the assumption of com-
pound nucleus formation: the neutrino interaction leaves
the nucleus in a state of thermal equilibrium which de-
excites independently of the manner in which it was
formed. The number of open decay channels is taken to
be large enough that competition between them can be
modeled statistically. That is, transitions to individual
nuclear ﬁnal states can be neglected in favor of averag-
ing over many states of approximately the same energy

[79]. This last assumption is not strictly true for excita-
tion energies slightly above the lowest fragment emission
threshold. In such cases it is adopted as an approxima-
tion.

Compound nucleus modeling is a key ingredient in nu-
clear reaction codes designed to compute nucleon-nucleus
and nucleus-nucleus cross sections, such as TALYS,
EMPIRE [80], CCONE [81], and CoH3 [82]. The treat-
ment in MARLEY uses the Hauser-Feshbach formalism [83]
common to these other codes.

2. Fragment transmission coeﬃcients

Here the initial (ﬁnal) nucleus has excitation energy Ex
(E(cid:48)x), total spin J (J (cid:48)), and parity Π (Π(cid:48)); s, (cid:96), and j are
the spin, orbital, and total angular momentum quantum
numbers of the emitted fragment; ρi (ρf ) is the density
of nuclear levels in the vicinity of the initial (ﬁnal) state;
ε is the total kinetic energy of the ﬁnal particles in the
rest frame of the initial nucleus; and Eγ is the energy
of the emitted γ-ray. For decays involving emission of
a fragment with parity πa, the value of Π(cid:48) is ﬁxed by
conservation of parity:

Π(cid:48) = (

1)(cid:96) πa Π .

−

(40)

The possible γ-ray transitions are labeled by their multi-
1 and by whether they are electric (X = E)
polarity λ
or magnetic (X = M) in nature. These two alternatives
are distinguished based on the multipolarity and the nu-
clear parity:

≥

The transmission coeﬃcients T(cid:96)j and TXλ quantify
how likely each decay mode is to occur. The methods
used to compute them are described in sections IV B 2
and IV B 3. For practical calculations, the inﬁnite sums
that appear in eqs. (38) and (39) must be truncated.
Because the value of T(cid:96)j (TXλ) falls oﬀ rapidly with in-
creasing (cid:96) (λ), terms beyond (cid:96) = λ = 5 are neglected.

The HFSM is often communicated in terms of nuclear
scattering cross sections instead of decay widths. To aid
the reader in connecting the expressions given here with
more standard presentations (see, e.g., refs. [84, 85]), a
brief derivation of eq. (38) is provided in appendix A.

The fragment transmission coeﬃcients T(cid:96)j used in
eq. (38) are computed by solving the radial Schr¨odinger

sions in eqs. (51) and (52) may be derived from eqs. (38)
and (39) by treating ρf as a delta function centered on
the nuclear level of interest.

To compute γ-ray strength functions in this work, I adopt
the Standard Lorentzian model from RIPL-3 [78], which
is based on early studies by Brink [88] and Axel [89]. This
model assumes that γ-ray emissions of type Xλ occur via
de-excitation of the corresponding giant multipole reso-
nance, which is parameterized in terms of its centroid
excitation energy EX(cid:96), width ΓX(cid:96), and peak cross sec-
tion σX(cid:96). The strength function is evaluated according

4. Transitions to discrete nuclear levels

The diﬀerential decay widths given in eqs. (38)
and (39) are appropriate for use at high excitation en-
ergies E(cid:48)x where the nuclear levels may be modeled as a
continuum. When a discrete level scheme is available for
the ﬁnal-state nuclide, MARLEY uses the excitation energy

In the continuum, the ﬁnal level density ρf is computed
according to the Back-shifted Fermi gas model (BFM)
described in appendix B. The initial level density ρi is
evaluated according to the BFM at all excitation ener-
gies. However, since the overall factor involving ρi can-
cels out in the evaluation of decay branching ratios, the
speciﬁc model chosen for ρi does not have any impact on
the simulation results.

V. RESULTS

In this section, the MARLEY 1.2.0 implementation of
the theoretical models described above is used to ob-
tain predictions of total and diﬀerential cross sections
for the reaction 40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗. Because MARLEY cal-
culates the four-momentum of every ﬁnal-state particle
for every event, various additional distributions may be
studied beyond those presented in this work.

A.

Inclusive cross section

Figure 4 shows MARLEY predictions of the total cross
section for inclusive charged-current νe absorption on
40Ar. The important role played by the Coulomb cor-
rections discussed in section II B is illustrated by the dif-
ferent curves in the plot. The default MARLEY approach

black line gives the cross section calculated using the de-
fault approach, while the dotted cyan and dashed red
lines give, respectively, the corresponding cross sections
obtained when the Fermi function and MEMA are used
unconditionally. Applying either correction leads to an
enhancement of the total cross section over the uncor-
rected result, which is drawn as the blue dash-dotted line.
The relationships between the diﬀerent approaches to
Coulomb corrections in the present calculation are qual-
itatively similar to those seen previously using a CRPA
model [35], but there are some details that are diﬀer-
ent, e.g., the cross sections calculated using the Fermi
function and the MEMA intersect at a neutrino energy
between 50–60 MeV, about 10 MeV lower than in the
CRPA result.

B. Exclusive cross sections

Figure 5 presents the ﬁrst calculation at supernova en-
ergies of total cross sections for exclusive ﬁnal states in
the reaction 40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗. Each exclusive channel is
labeled in terms of its hadronic content, but zero or more
de-excitation γ-rays are allowed even when not explicitly
listed. Below a neutrino energy of about 10 MeV, only
transitions to bound nuclear levels are energetically pos-
sible. These de-excite via γ-ray emission. Single neutron
emission becomes appreciable around 15 MeV. Although
the proton (7.58 MeV) and alpha particle (6.44 MeV)
separation energies for 40K are comparable to the neu-
tron separation energy (7.80 MeV), the Coulomb barrier
experienced by these charged particles suppresses their
emission relative to neutrons.

Throughout the remainder of this paper, calculations

trino energy Eν is expressed in terms of the mean energy

νe spectrum, which I denote by SNT . I also consider four
instantaneous spectra estimated using ﬁg. 1 of ref. [92].
These are labeled SN1 through SN4 in chronological or-
der. Table III gives the values of the spectral parameters
and the approximate elapsed time since the start of the
supernova for each of these conﬁgurations.

The second source of low-energy electron neutrinos

considered in this work is the decay

Experimental facilities which generate large numbers of
stopped muons, such as the Spallation Neutron Source
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, provide a valuable
opportunity to study tens-of-MeV neutrino interactions
using a terrestrial source [94].

and the integrals in eqs. (57) and (58) are over the en-
tire neutrino spectrum. Here σL is the inclusive total
cross section for transitions to a particular 40K nuclear
level L and RL(f ) is the branching ratio for the ﬁnal
state f when the de-excitation cascade begins at the
level L. The sum in eq. (57) runs over all energetically-
accessible nuclear levels. All quantities in eq. (57) are
calculated analytically except for RL(f ), which is esti-
mated using Monte Carlo simulations of de-excitations

uncertainty associated with each entry in table IV never
exceeds 10% and is typically much smaller.

C. Electron angle and energy distributions

Figure 6 shows ﬂux-averaged diﬀerential cross sections
predicted by MARLEY for the laboratory-frame scattering
cosine of the outgoing electron. The upper panel shows
the total result (solid black) for the SNT νe spectrum to-
gether with the separate contributions arising from Fermi
(dashed blue) and Gamow-Teller (dotted red) transitions.
The lower panel presents the same quantities for the
µDAR νe spectrum. Competition between the two linear
components of the cross section gives rise to a total an-
gular distribution that is nearly ﬂat in both cases, with
SNT being slightly forward and µDAR slightly backward.
A recent theoretical study [36] has pointed out that
forbidden nuclear transitions, which are neglected in the
present calculation, have an increasingly strong eﬀect
on the electron angular distribution as the neutrino en-
ergy grows beyond a few tens of MeV. Deviations from
the linear behavior shown in ﬁg. 6 signal the breakdown
of the allowed approximation used by MARLEY. A future
measurement of the 40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗ angular diﬀerential
cross section will thus provide a powerful constraint on
the nuclear modeling needed to predict the relative con-
tributions of the allowed and forbidden transitions.

Figure 7 shows the ﬂux-averaged diﬀerential cross sec-
tion with respect to the kinetic energy of the outgoing
electron. The inclusive prediction for the SNT (µDAR)
spectrum is shown by the solid black line in the upper
(lower) panel, with the other line styles used to repre-
sent individual contributions from four exclusive ﬁnal
states. While the cross sections for both spectra are
dominated by de-excitation modes involving only γ-rays
(loosely dotted blue) or single neutron emission (densely

dotted red), the contribution of the latter is much more
pronounced for the µDAR case. The small cross sections
for single proton and single α emission are also notice-
ably enhanced as one moves from the SNT spectrum to
the µDAR spectrum.

A useful property of the excess binding energy is that
only a few discrete values of this variable are likely to
occur at supernova energies. A future analysis of super-
nova neutrino data may therefore attempt to correct for
nonzero values of (cid:15)bind by tagging events in which a nu-
cleon or a heavy fragment was emitted from the struck
nucleus.

Beyond the binding energy contributions, the other
terms in eq. (64) vary in the degree to which they may
be reconstructed by a detector. In a liquid argon time
projection chamber (LArTPC), the primary electron will
produce a cm-scale ionization track which may be used
to determine its energy and direction. De-excitation γ-
rays will produce isolated small energy depositions within
several tens of cm of the interaction vertex, primarily via
Compton scattering on atomic electrons. Reconstruction
of both of these features for supernova neutrino interac-
tions is considered in ref. [31], with the conclusion that
the energy associated with each can largely be recovered

Neu-
tron tagging and calorimetry, on the other hand, were
found to be far more challenging.

Low-energy charged nuclear fragments, such as pro-
tons and alpha particles, may also produce observable
ionizations in a LArTPC. A key challenge for identifying
the activity induced by these particles is that, at the en-
ergies relevant for supernova neutrinos, charged hadrons
will produce mm-scale or smaller ionization tracks. These
will likely be diﬃcult to distinguish from the longer track
produced by the primary electron. However, if events
involving charged nuclear fragment emission can be suc-
cessfully tagged, perhaps by identifying unusually large
charge deposits near the start of the primary electron
track, then at least some of the charged hadron kinetic
energy may be recoverable.

To assess the relative importance of the various terms
on the right-hand side of eq. (64), I deﬁne several ob-
servables, all of which may be interpreted as a recon-
structed neutrino energy Ereco
under diﬀerent, often
quite optimistic, assumptions. The simplest reconstruc-
tion method involves adding the outgoing electron’s total
energy to the minimum possible change in binding energy
for CC νe absorption on 40Ar:

ν

Ereco

e ≡

Emin

bind + Ee .

(70)

This estimate of the neutrino energy may be reﬁned by
adding the summed energies of all de-excitation γ-rays

Ereco

e+γ ≡

(71)

and further reﬁned by adding the summed kinetic ener-
gies of all ﬁnal-state charged hadrons

Ereco

vis ≡

Ereco

e+γ +

Tch .

(72)

I call the last of these variables the visible energy while
recognizing that low-energy neutrons may nevertheless
produce some observable signals in a LArTPC.

Finally, I consider three possible strategies for imple-
menting a binding energy correction via tagging of ﬁnal-
state nuclear fragments. All three involve conditionally
adding one or more terms to the expression for the visible
energy above. Under the assumption that de-excitation
neutrons may be successfully tagged, I deﬁne the recon-
structed neutrino energy

En

Ereco

vis + δn (cid:15)1n

(73)

in which the symbol δn is deﬁned to be unity when a
MARLEY event contains at least one ﬁnal-state neutron
and zero otherwise. Similarly, under the assumption that
charged nuclear fragment emission may be successfully
identiﬁed, I deﬁne

17

charged nuclear fragment in the ﬁnal state and zero when
it does not. In an ideal scenario in which both of these
tagging techniques are reliable, a still more reﬁned esti-
mate of the neutrino energy may be obtained via

Figure 8 shows the MARLEY prediction for ﬂux-averaged
diﬀerential sections with respect to each of these observ-
ables. The top (bottom) panel of the ﬁgure presents re-
sults for the SNT (µDAR) energy spectrum deﬁned ear-
lier. A solid black line is used to draw the diﬀerential
cross section with respect to the true neutrino energy,
while the other line styles represent the various methods
for reconstructing it. The Ereco
result is not shown in
vis
the top panel since it is diﬃcult to distinguish from the
Ereco

e+γ one on the scale of the plot.
For both spectra studied, the agreement between the
reconstructed and true neutrino energy distributions im-
proves most dramatically as one moves from using only
the primary electron (Ereco
, thin dashed green) to using
both the electron and the de-excitation γ-rays (Ereco
e+γ ,
densely dotted brown) in the reconstruction. Although
inclusion of information about charged hadrons is also
seen to be helpful, the next most important improvement
comes from the inclusion of binding energy corrections
related to neutron tagging (En
tag, thick dashed violet).
Due to the higher mean energy of the µDAR spectrum,
nuclear fragment emission becomes more important rela-
tive to SNT , and the impact of the tagging-based binding
energy corrections on neutrino energy reconstruction be-
comes more pronounced.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Due to the potential for DUNE to obtain a once-in-a-
lifetime large-statistics measurement of supernova elec-
tron neutrinos, achieving a detailed understanding of
tens-of-MeV neutrino-argon interactions is an investment
that may yield a high scientiﬁc return. This paper ex-
pands the ability to model these interactions by provid-
ing a ﬁrst calculation of exclusive cross sections for the
40Ar(νe, e−)40K∗ reaction at supernova energies. The im-
plementation of the models underlying this calculation
in the MARLEY event generator enables studies of neu-
trino energy reconstruction to be carried out easily. The
simple approach pursued in section V D reveals the sub-
stantial role that measuring the energies of de-excitation
γ-rays and (though diﬃcult) neutron tagging may play
in optimizing supernova νe energy resolution in a future
analysis by DUNE. Further insights are available by using
MARLEY in conjunction with a realistic detector simulation
[15, 31].

Two major approximations adopted in MARLEY 1.2.0
constitute limitations on the present study that should
be revisited in future research. The ﬁrst of these is the
allowed approximation invoked during derivation of the
inclusive diﬀerential cross section in section II A. In a

which fell into the neutrino energy bin b of interest.

The vertical line seen around 4 MeV for the Ereco
curve (thin dashed green) corresponds to the MARLEY en-
ergy threshold for CC νe absorption. Because the third-
forbidden transition between the ground states of 40Ar
(J π = 0+) and 40K (J π = 4−) is neglected under the al-
lowed approximation, MARLEY predicts a ﬁnite resolution
for Ereco

even at threshold.

more detailed calculation of this cross section, the factor
eiq
x(n) that appears in the nuclear matrix element from
·
eq. (8) is expanded in a series of multipoles [95] that de-
pend on the spherical Bessel function jJ (
rn), where
|
rn is the magnitude of x(n) and J is the multipole order.
Terms representing forbidden nuclear transitions (J > 0)
0 limit imposed by the allowed ap-
vanish in the
proximation, but their contribution to the cross section
becomes increasingly important as the momentum trans-
fer grows. Since the centroid energy of the multipole gi-
1/3 MeV
ant resonances grows with J roughly like 41 J A−
[96], the inclusion of forbidden transitions should enhance
neutrino scattering to high-lying unbound nuclear states
which de-excite primarily via fragment emission. The
degree to which this observation aﬀects the present re-
sults may be studied in the future by combining a more
detailed calculation of the inclusive diﬀerential cross sec-
tion with the MARLEY de-excitation model.

The second major approximation used in this work,
which is shared by nearly all calculations of exclusive
cross sections for tens-of-MeV neutrino-nucleus scatter-
ing, is the compound nucleus assumption discussed in
section IV B. Further investigation, both theoretical and
experimental, will be needed to clarify the degree to
which direct knock-out and pre-equilibrium processes
may safely be neglected in models of low-energy neutrino-
nucleus reactions. A key question is how the transition
between the compound nucleus picture, which is stan-
dard for low-energy neutrinos, and the intranuclear cas-
cade picture, which is commonly used in models of ac-
celerator neutrino interactions, should be handled as a
function of neutrino energy.

Although the current discussion has focused specif-
ically on the description of nuclear de-excitations fol-
lowing CC νe absorption on 40Ar, the model presented
in section IV is suﬃciently general that it may be ap-
plied unaltered in a variety of other contexts. A natu-
ral next step is the use of MARLEY together with an in-
clusive description of inelastic neutral-current scattering
on argon, a process for which de-excitations provide the
only experimental observables apart from nuclear recoil.
While measurements of tens-of-MeV neutrino-argon in-
elastic cross sections must be pursued to meet the needs
of the DUNE supernova neutrino program, more immedi-
ate opportunities for confronting MARLEY with data may
become available if the code is used to obtain predictions
for other nuclei. Near-future measurements that could
provide a detailed test of MARLEY include studies of CC
νe absorption on carbon by JSNS2 [33] and neutrino-
induced neutron production on lead, iron, and copper
by COHERENT [97]. Measurements of exclusive cross
sections and decay rates for processes that are closely re-
lated to neutrino interactions, such as electron-nucleus
scattering [45] and muon capture [98, 99], may also pro-
vide helpful model constraints. Finally, the capabilities
of MARLEY may prove useful in simulating nuclear de-
excitations induced by processes beyond the Standard
Model, including nucleon decay [100, 101] and the ab-

sorption of fermionic dark matter [102, 103].

Appendix A: Decay width for fragment emission

In this appendix, I give a brief derivation of the ex-
pression in eq. (38) for the nuclear fragment emission
diﬀerential decay width of a compound nucleus. A simi-
lar approach can be used to obtain the result in eq. (39)
for γ-ray emission. The argument presented here is a
modern version of one originally given by Weisskopf in
ref. [79].

Consider the decay process i

a + f in which a com-
pound nucleus i emits a fragment a to become a ﬁnal-
state nucleus f . Adopt the same notation as in sec-
tion IV B 1: the initial (ﬁnal) nucleus has spin J (J (cid:48)),
parity Π (Π(cid:48)), and mass M (M (cid:48)). The emitted frag-
ment has spin s, orbital (total) angular momentum (cid:96) (j),
three-momentum magnitude k , mass ma, and parity πa.
Denote the initial nuclear excitation energy by Ex, and
let the ﬁnal nuclear excitation energy lie on the small in-
terval [E(cid:48)x, E(cid:48)x + dE(cid:48)x]. The symbol ρi (ρf ) denotes the
spin-parity dependent level density (see appendix B 2) in
the vicinity of Ex (E(cid:48)x) for the initial (ﬁnal) nucleus.

Within an arbitrary volume V and in the rest frame of
the initial nucleus, the number of states na+f that may
be populated by the decay is given by

The nuclear level density model used in the present

Back-shifted Fermi gas Model (BFM), which is based on
the work of Koning, Hilaire, and Goriely [73]. The “back
shift” used by this model, which accounts for nucleon
pairing eﬀects, involves replacing the nuclear excitation
energy Ex by an eﬀective value U deﬁned by

Although a constant value for the level density param-

functional form [104] recommended by RIPL-3 to correct
for the damping of shell eﬀects at high excitation ener-

Here δW (Z, A) is the shell correction energy, ˜a(A) is the
asymptotic value of aLD at high excitation energies, and

γ is a damping parameter that represents how quickly
aLD(Ex, Z, A) approaches ˜a(A). The values of these three
parameters are given by the relations

diction for the nuclear mass excess using the liquid drop
model [78, p. 3164] [72, 106].

This work uses the global “BFM eﬀective” values of the
empirical parameters α, β, δ, and γ0 obtained in ref. [73]
using ﬁts to nuclear level data:

J and parity Π near excitation energy Ex may be written

3. Parity dependence

Most level density calculations assume equipartition of

parity, i.e.,

(B18)

I adopt this assumption in agreement with RIPL-3.
However, I note that more sophisticated treatments of
π(Ex, J, Π) have been proposed (see, e.g., ref. [108]).

For the statistical model calculations reported here and
implemented in MARLEY, the global nuclear optical poten-

The volume (V ), surface (D), and spin-orbit (SO)
terms of the optical potential are functions that may be
expressed as the product of an energy-dependent well

depth and an energy-independent radial part:

Tables 10 and 11 from ref. [86] list the parameters needed
to calculate the well depths for a nucleon projectile.

2. Complex projectiles

To compute the nuclear optical potential for complex
projectiles (A > 1), MARLEY implements a superposition
model based on a recommendation by Madland [110]. It
is equivalent to the default treatment used by TALYS.
Under this approach, the radial optical model param-
eters for a projectile with mass number A and proton
(neutron) number Z (N ) are computed by weighting the
corresponding parameters for individual nucleons:

rV =

aV =

N rn

V + Z rp
A

V

N an

V + Z ap
A

V

rD, rSO likewise

(C19)

aD, aSO likewise.

(C20)

The Coulomb radius parameter rC remains unchanged
from the nucleon case. The well depths are evaluated

according to the relations

VV (εlab) =N V n

V (εlab/A) + Z V p

V (εlab/A)

WV ,WD likewise

VSO(εlab) =

SO(εlab) + V p
V n

SO(εlab)

2A

WSO likewise

23

In the expressions above, the superscript n (p) denotes
the value of the corresponding quantity for an individual
neutron (proton), e.g., V n
SO(εlab) is the spin-orbit well
depth for a neutron projectile.
