Abstract. Axions are among the best motivated dark matter candidates. Their production
in the early Universe by the vacuum misalignment mechanism gives rise to isocurvature per-
turbations, which are constrained by cosmic microwave background measurements. In this
paper, we compute the axion isocurvature power spectrum using spectral expansion in the
stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama formalism, which captures non-linear eﬀects in the axion
dynamics. In contrast to most of the existing literature, we focus on high inﬂationary Hub-
ble rates of order 1013 GeV, and demonstrate that there is a signiﬁcant window in which
axions can account for all or part of the dark matter abundance without violating the isocur-
vature bounds or tensor mode bounds. Crucially, we ﬁnd that the isocurvature spectrum
is dominated by non-perturbative contributions in a large part of this window. Therefore
the commonly used linear approximation is not reliable in this region, making the stochastic
approach essential.

Axions [1, 2] are hypothetical particles which arise as pseudo-Goldstone bosons when the
Peccei-Quinn symmetry [3, 4] is spontaneously broken as a solution to the strong CP problem.
As stable, neutral particles they are a natural candidate for cold dark matter (CDM), and
a lot of theoretical work has been done in the past few decades on both conventional QCD
axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) [5–7]. In this paper we assume that the Peccei-Quinn
symmetry undergoes phase transition during inﬂation, producing axions through the vacuum
misalignment mechanism (see e.g. Ref. [8–11]), where the coherent oscillations of the axion
ﬁeld in the post-inﬂationary epoch account for the axion CDM particle production.

Quantum ﬂuctuations in the axion ﬁeld during the inﬂationary epoch introduce an
isocurvature component to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [6, 12–16], which is
heavily constrained by current observations [17]. Most of the existing work has focussed on
the “anthropic window” [15] at low inﬂationary Hubble rates, H (cid:46) 108 GeV, where the ax-

focus on the “classic window” identiﬁed in Ref. [15] at H ∼ 1013 GeV, which has received
less attention in the context of isocurvature perturbations. As we will see, the usual linear
or perturbative techniques are not fully applicable in this case, and instead, we will use the
stochastic approach [18, 19].

In the stochastic approach, the dynamics of the axion ﬁeld on super-horizon scales is
described by a stochastic Langevin equation. It has been applied to axions before, e.g., in
Refs. [20, 21], where it was used to compute the one-point probability distribution of the
ﬁeld. In this paper, we go beyond that by using the spectral expansion method [19, 22–24],
which allows the numerical determination of the exact asymptotic long-distance behaviour
of any correlation function in de Sitter spacetime within the stochastic approximation. This
allows us to compute the isocurvature power spectrum without having to rely on linear or
perturbative assumption.

This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the axion dark matter
model and the stochastic approach. In Section 3, we present the results of our calculations

and the observational constraints that follow from them. We then discuss our ﬁndings and
present our conclusions in Section 4.

2 Stochastic approach for the axion

2.1 Axion dark matter

Let us consider an axion ﬁeld a with cosine potential

(cid:20)

V (a) = V0

1 − cos

(cid:19)(cid:21)
,

(cid:18) a
Fa

(2.1)

where Fa is the decay constant of the axion, and V0 is a constant which is related to the axion
mass ma through V0 = F 2

a. The axion ﬁeld a(x) can be written as

a m2

a(x) = Faφ(x),

(2.2)

where φ(x) is a dimensionless phase angle.

We will consider both a general axion scenario, in which the particles are often referred
to as ALPs and in which V0 and Fa are free parameters, and the speciﬁc case of the QCD
axion, in which the potential is generated by non-perturbative QCD eﬀects, so that

V0 (cid:39) Λ4

QCD,

(2.3)

where ΛQCD ∼ 250 MeV is the QCD breaking scale. Although it is common to use the term
axion to refer to only QCD axions, we use is cover both cases for simplicity.

As stable, electrically neutral scalar particles, axions are a candidate for dark matter.
We will focus on the scenario in which they are produced by the vacuum misalignment mech-
anism [8–11]: During inﬂation, quantum ﬂuctuations drive the axion ﬁeld away from its
vacuum state so that when inﬂation ends, the phase angle φ has a non-zero value, known
as the vacuum misalignment angle. Eventually the axion ﬁeld starts to oscillate about its
vacuum state, and these oscillations can be interpreted as dark matter particles. The energy
density ρ of these particles depends on the amplitude of the oscillations, which is determined
by the vacuum misalignment angle.

If the potential was purely harmonic, the axion ﬁeld would simply undergo damped
harmonic oscillations, and the produced dark matter density would be simply proportional
to the potential energy,

ρharm(φ) ∝

V0φ2.

(2.4)

However, for the cosine potential (2.1) the dependence is more complicated [25], which is easy
to see by considering a misalignment angle φ ≈ π, which is close to the top of the potential
barrier.
In that case the ﬁeld will initially roll very slowly away from the maximum, and
during this time the energy density remains approximately constant. The ﬁnal energy density
is therefore much higher than what the harmonic approximation would predict. Including this
eﬀect, the ﬁnal energy density can be approximated by [7, 26]

ρ(φ) ∝ V0f (φ),

(2.5)

where we have introduced the dimensionless anharmonic function f (φ).

The correlation length of the misalignment angle φ depends greatly on the parameters.
We will discuss this in more detail in Section 3, but as a rule of thumb, if H (cid:28) Fa then
the correlation length is many Hubble lengths. In that case, the misalignment angle φ can
be considered to be uniform across the whole Universe, with a random value that cannot
be predicted. The dark matter density parameter ΩDM would be determined by it through
Eq. (2.5), and one can ask how likely it is to agree with the observed dark matter density
parameter [27],

ΩDM h2 (cid:39) 0.12 .
This leads to anthropic considerations, and therefore this is often called the "anthropic win-
dow" [6, 15]. This is the case most existing literature on isocurvature perturbations has
focused on.

(2.6)

In contrast, we consider the opposite case H (cid:38) Fa, in which the currently observable
Universe consists of a large number of patches between which the misalignment angle φ was
uncorrelated. Locally in each post-inﬂationary Hubble volume, Eq. (2.5) is still valid, but
observations should be compared with its average value

ΩDM h2 = 0.12 × 2(cid:104)f (φ)(cid:105)

(cid:18)

Fa

,

(2.7)

where the expectation value (cid:104)f (φ)(cid:105) is the average over the equilibrium distribution of the ﬁeld
at the end of inﬂation. Because Eq. (2.5) is not a linear function, this is not the same as the
dark matter density parameter computed using the average misalignment angle.

The position-dependence of the misalignment angle also means that the produced dark
matter density will be diﬀerent in diﬀerent parts of the Universe, which corresponds to isocur-
vature perturbations and can be potentially observed through measurements of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. The local isocurvature perturbation S((cid:126)x) is given
by the relative ﬂuctuation of the dark matter density ρ,

S((cid:126)x) =

ρ((cid:126)x) − (cid:104)ρ(cid:105)
(cid:104)ρ(cid:105)

.

(2.8)

CMB observations place an upper bound on the power spectrum PS of this quantity, given
by the Fourier transform of the correlation function

GS((cid:126)x) ≡ (cid:104)S(0)S((cid:126)x)(cid:105) =

This places constraints on axion dark matter models. The isocurvature power spectrum
predicted by axion dark matter scenarios has been studied in the literature, but usually in
the harmonic approximation. In what follows, we compute it non-perturbatively using the
stochastic approach.

2.2 The stochastic method

In de Sitter spacetime, which is a good approximation for spacetime geometry during inﬂation,
quantum ﬂuctuations of any light scalar ﬁeld are ampliﬁed by the expansion of space. On
superhorizon scales, it can therefore be considered as a classical ﬁeld. However, as comoving
quantum modes leave the horizon, they contribute to this classical ﬁeld, giving rise to a
stochastic noise term. Therefore the superhorizon dynamics of the scalar ﬁeld is described by
a stochastic classical Langevin equation [18, 19],

˙φ = −

and ξ is a Gaussian stochastic white noise term, which satisﬁes

δ(t − t(cid:48)).

(2.13)

(2.14)

Here H is the Hubble rate during inﬂation, which we assume to be constant. The absence of
primordial tensor modes in CMB observations implies the upper bound [17]

H (cid:46) 6.1 × 1013 GeV.

(2.15)

The time evolution of the probability distribution P (φ; t) then satisﬁes the Fokker-Planck

Using this, it is possible to calculate the expectation value (cid:104)f (φ)(cid:105) in Eq. (2.7) as

(cid:90)

(cid:104)f (φ)(cid:105) =

dφ Peq(φ)f (φ).

(2.23)

The spectral expansion also makes it possible to compute correlation functions, such as
Eq. (2.9). The correlator of any function f (φ) between two diﬀerent times t1 and t2 is given
by [19, 23]

(cid:10)f (cid:0)φ(t1)(cid:1)f (cid:0)φ(t2)(cid:1)(cid:11) =

(2.24)

(2.25)

For the isocurvature power spectrum (2.9) we need the spatial equal-time correlator, which
can be obtained using de Sitter invariance [19, 23] as

Λn.

Figure 1. The “potential” W (φ) entering the Schrödinger type eigenvalue equation (2.30) for α = 1.
The blue curve shows the full function, while the orange curve shows the harmonic approximation.

It is important to note that this equation, and therefore the spectrum, depends only on α.

Equation (2.30) has the form of the Schrödinger equation with “potential” W (φ) =
v(cid:48)(φ)2 − v(cid:48)(cid:48)(φ), shown in Fig. 1 for α = 1. It has a minimum at φ = 0, which is also the
minimum of the axion potential V (φ), and if α > 3/8π2, it has also another higher minimum
at φ = ±π, which is a maximum of the axion potential.

Because φ is assumed to be a phase angle, the eigenfunctions ψn have to be periodic.
Therefore Eq. (2.18) is deﬁned over the range −π < φ ≤ π, with periodic boundary conditions.
The equation has reﬂection symmetry φ → −φ, which means that the eigenfunctions can be
divided into even and odd parity. Furthermore, in general, the eigenvalue equation (2.18) has
the form of the Schrödinger equation in supersymmetric quantum mechanics [28, 29]. The
supersymmetry transformation

ψ → ˜ψ = ψ(cid:48) + v(cid:48)ψ

(2.32)

maps eigenfunctions of the original potential V (φ) to those of the ﬂipped potential −V (φ)
with the same eigenvalue. In the case of Eq. (2.1), this sign ﬂip can be cancelled by shifting
the ﬁeld φ → φ + π, and therefore the supersymmetry transformation is actually a map
to a diﬀerent eigenfunction in the same theory. Because the supersymmetry transformation
changes the parity, the spectrum consists of degenerate pairs of odd and even eigenfunctions,
i.e., Λ2n = Λ2n−1 for all n > 0. With correction terms for the axion potential, this shift
symmetry is broken and the eigenspectrum loses its degeneracy.

2.4 Harmonic approximation

For comparison with the full stochastic treatment for the axion, we ﬁrst consider the harmonic
approximation, in which the axion potential (2.1) has the quadratic form. We use

for the potential, and the quadratic energy density (2.4), which corresponds to

V (φ) =

.

(2.33)

(2.34)

This corresponds to the free ﬁeld approximation, and therefore the calculations could be done
directly in quantum ﬁeld theory without the use of the stochastic approximation. However,

we use the stochastic approximation, because it works well as long as the axion mass is not
much higher than the Hubble rate and because it allows a direct comparison with the full
stochastic results. Then following the steps in Section 2.3 to ﬁnd the eigenvalue equation for
the quadratic potential (2.33), we get the harmonic eigenvalue equation,

3 Results

3.1 Parameters

The full parameter space of the general axion model is three-dimensional, consisting of the
axion decay constant Fa, the inﬂationary Hubble rate H, and the dimensionless parameter α
deﬁned in Eq. (2.31). We focus on the case in which axions give a dominant contribution to
the dark matter density, and therefore Eqs. (2.5), (2.6) and (2.7) allow us to determine the
required value of Fa,

state ψ0 centred at φ = 0. The parity of the eigenfunction with respect to φ = 0 corresponds to its
number.

The right-hand side, which can be computed using Eq. (2.23), depends monotonically on α
as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore we are left with a two-dimensional parameter space (Fa, H).

In the harmonic approximation, Eq. (3.1) gives the relation Fa ∝ α6/7. This would mean
that for any value of Fa it would be possible to ﬁnd α that gives the correct dark matter
density. However, this is actually not true.
In the full case, the highest possible value of
(cid:104)f (φ)(cid:105) is approximately 4.386, reached at α = 0. This means that, as shown in Fig. 2, axions
can only be the dominant dark matter component if

Fa (cid:38) 7.8 × 1010 GeV.

(3.2)

In the speciﬁc case of the QCD axion, Eq. (2.3) gives another relation between the
parameters. For the Hubble rates that we are interested in, this corresponds simply to the
limit α → 0, and therefore one needs Fa ≈ 7.8 × 1010 GeV to get the dominant dark matter
contribution from QCD axions.

3.2 Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues

We found the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the full case (2.30) numerically using Math-
ematica. The ﬁrst ﬁve eigenfunctions for α = 1 are represented in Figure 3, with ψ1 and
ψ2 being degenerate, and likewise for ψ3 and ψ4. These eigenfunctions enter the spectral
coeﬃcients (2.25), and therefore determine the axion density correlator.

From Fig. 3 we observe that the ground state ψ0 is centred at the minimum of the axion
potential (2.1), as would be expected since the most likely location of the axion is at rest at
the bottom of the potential. However, the higher order eigenfunctions at each degeneracy
level are centred on diﬀerent symmetry points (φ = 0 and φ = ±π), and one is always even
and one is odd w.r.t φ = 0. The states localised around φ = 0, which is the minimum of the
potential (2.1), can be thought of as perturbative states, and are indeed well approximated
by the harmonic approximation (2.35) when α is suﬃciently large. In contrast, the states
localised around φ = π do not have a counterpart in the harmonic spectrum, and correspond
physically to non-perturbative states. However, it should be noted that they can still be
approximated by a harmonic expansion about φ = ±π.

As our density function f (φ) deﬁned in Eq. (2.5) is even, only even eigenfunctions con-
tribute to the spectral expansion (2.26) of the axion density correlator. Because the lowest

even excited state, ψ2, is non-perturbative, this means that non-perturbative contributions
are crucial for the correlation function (2.9), and the standard linear or perturbative approx-
imations are not reliable.

The behaviour of the lowest even eigenvalues βn and the corresponding spectral coeﬃ-
cients fn as functions of α is shown in Fig. 4. For large α, the eigenvalues increase linearly
with α, in good agreement with the harmonic approximation (2.36).
Interestingly this is
true even for the lowest eigenvalue β2 which corresponds to a non-perturbative state and
should therefore not be present in the harmonic approximation. In spite of this β2 is well
approximated by βharm
. This agreement of eigenvalues is a consequence of supersymme-
try: The supersymmetry transformation (2.32), combined with a shift of φ, maps ψ2 to ψ1,
which is well approximated by ψharm
. The next even state, ψ4, is perturbative, and is well
approximated by the harmonic eigenfunction ψharm

2
For smaller α, the eigenvalues βn are no longer well approximated by the harmonic
approximation, and instead of vanishing in the limit α → 0 as the harmonic approximation
(2.36) predicts, they reach non-zero values. In particular, one ﬁnds that

as expected.

β2 =

(3.3)

and more generally βn ≥ 1/8π2 for all even n.

From Fig. 4, one can also observe that the spectral coeﬃcient f2 becomes very small
when α increases. This happens because the spectral coeﬃcients fn depend on the overlap
of the ground state ψ0 with the excited state ψn. The perturbative states centred around
the minimum will naturally have a higher spectral coeﬃcient (provided that they have the
correct parity), while the contribution from non-perturbative states such as ψ2 will depend
strongly on the value of α and decreases when α becomes large. Using the analogy with the
Schrödinger equation, this can be thought of as a tunnelling problem. With higher α, the

the coeﬃcient f2 becomes exponentially small.

In contrast, the spectral coeﬃcient f4 of the perturbative state ψ4 behaves as f harm
at
large α and therefore only decreases as 1/α. On the other hand, it is worth noting that it
changes sign at α ≈ 0.12, and therefore it has a small value in the neighbourhood of that
point.

When H (cid:28) Fa, the exponent in Eq. (3.4) is small, but the sine factor suppresses the
amplitude, and therefore for suﬃciently low H, the isocurvature constraint is satisﬁed. This
corresponds to the conventional “anthropic” stochastic axion region discussed in Refs. [6, 15].
On the other hand, for H (cid:29) Fa the exponent will always become large and negative because
β2 > 1/8π2 as discussed in Section 3.2, and therefore the isocurvature amplitude becomes
smaller again. This is the “classic window” discussed brieﬂy in Ref. [6, 15], and it is the region
we focus on. In this window, the currently observable Universe consists of a large number of
regions between which the axion ﬁeld is uncorrelated, and therefore the expectation value (cid:104)f (cid:105)
in Eq. (3.4) can be identiﬁed with the equilibrium expectation value.

We computed the isocurvature spectrum (3.4) as a function of the two free parameters H
and Fa using the numerically evaluated eigenvalues βn and eigenfunctions ψn, and compared
the result with the observational bound (2.11). As expected, the isocurvature spectrum has
its maximum values as a function of H between the anthropic and classic windows, and
therefore it constrains H from below within the classic window. Other constraints arise from
dark matter abundance (3.2) and from tensor modes (2.15). The allowed region is shown in
Fig. 5. The speciﬁc case of the QCD axion corresponds to the lower edge of the white region.
Overall, the triangular shape of the allowed region agrees approximately with existing
literature [6, 15]. However, the lower left corner has a non-trivial shape where the allowed
region is slightly narrower for Fa (cid:38) 5 × 1012 GeV than the harmonic approximation suggests,
and slightly wider for lower values of Fa. This is because of the non-linear features captured by
the stochastic calculation, speciﬁcally the behaviour of the eigenvalues and spectral coeﬃcients
shown in Fig. 4.

For high Fa (corresponding to high α), the harmonic approximation works well. Be-
cause the spectral coeﬃcient f2 is exponentially small, the dominant term in the sum (3.4)
corresponds to ψ4, which is a perturbative state well approximated by ψharm
. However, as
illustrated in Fig. 6, when we move down to Fa ≈ 4 × 1012 GeV, the spectral coeﬃcient f2
becomes so large that the non-perturbative state ψ2 becomes dominant. This contribution
is not included in the conventional linear approximation, which therefore underestimates the
isocurvature amplitude. As a result, the allowed region is smaller than the earlier calculations
suggested.

Figure 5. Allowed parameter space (white) for the inﬂationary Hubble parameter H and the axion
decay constant Fa in the “classic window”. In the brown region, the tensor mode amplitude would be
too high to be compatible with observations. In the black region, the dark matter density would be
too low. In the blue region, the isocurvature amplitude is too high. The blue dashed line shows the
bound obtained using the harmonic approximation, whereas the solid blue line corresponds to the full
stochastic calculation. The x-axis shows the inﬂationary Hubble rate, the left y-axis shows the decay
constant Fa, while the right y-axis gives the corresponding value of α = V0/H 4.

Further down, at Fa ≈ 9 × 1011 GeV, the contribution from ψ4 vanishes temporarily
when f4 changes sign. This gives rise to a spike in the blue curve in Fig. 6, but because
the contribution from ψ4 is already subdominant at those values of Fa, this feature is not
observationally relevant. At around the same values, the harmonic approximation also fails
to describe the eigenvalues β2 and β4 which instead approach constant values as discussed in
Section 3.2. This means that the isocurvature spectrum is suppressed relative to the harmonic
approximation, and as a consequence the allowed region is larger than what standard linear
calculations indicate.

4 Conclusions

In this work, we have used spectral expansions within the stochastic approximation to com-
pute the spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in an axion dark matter model with a cosine
potential. We focused on the “classic window” at high Hubble rates H (cid:38) 1012 GeV and found,
in line with earlier literature, that there is a window of parameters that are compatible with

the observed dark matter abundance and the observational constraints on the isocurvature
and tensor mode perturbations.

In particular, we found that for axion decay constants in the range 8 × 1010 GeV (cid:46) Fa (cid:46)
5 × 1012 GeV, the isocurvature spectrum is dominated by a non-perturbative contribution
and therefore cannot be correctly calculated using standard linear or perturbative techniques.
In this range of parameters, the leading term in the spectral expansion does not correspond
to small perturbative oscillations of the axion ﬁeld, but instead to transitions between the
minima of the periodic axion potential. In the upper end of the range, this gives an additional
contribution to the isocurvature spectrum on top of the perturbative contribution, and there-
fore the constraints are stronger than the perturbative calculation suggests. At lower values
of Fa, it is no longer possible to identify the terms in the spectral expansion with perturbative
and non-perturbative contributions, and the whole spectrum is more suppressed. Therefore
in this region, the constraints are weaker than the perturbative calculation suggests.

Our analysis highlights some interesting features in the behaviour of the theory within
the stochastic approximation. Because the theory is invariant under sign change of the poten-
tial, the spectrum consists of degenerate pairs of eigenfunctions which have opposite parity
and are related to each other by a supersymmetry transformation. When Fa is suﬃciently
large, one of the eigenfunctions corresponds to a perturbative and the other one to a non-
perturbative state. This means that there is a one-to-one mapping between perturbative
and non-perturbative contributions and that, in principle, it would be possible to compute
non-perturbative eﬀects using perturbative techniques. In our treatment, this follows as a
consequence of the stochastic approximation, but it would be interesting to see whether, and
to what extent, this correspondence extends to the full quantum ﬁeld theory.

Finally, we made several simplifying assumptions in our calculations, in particular ap-
proximating the inﬂationary spacetime with the de Sitter spacetime, ignoring any eﬀects of
post-inﬂationary evolution or topological defects such as axion strings, assuming a simple

eﬀects are likely to aﬀect the precise numerical values of the bounds, but at a qualitative level
the approximations should all be sound. In particular, the conclusion that non-perturbative
eﬀects are crucial for the isocurvature bound on the inﬂationary Hubble rate in the classic
axion window should therefore be valid, but more work is needed to take those eﬀects fully
into account.
