Abstract: 

 The main purpose of this research is to move the robotic arm (5DoF) in real-time, based on the

surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals, as obtained from the wireless Myo gesture armband 

to distinguish seven hand movements. The sEMG signals are biomedical signals that estimate and 

record  the  electrical  signals  produced  in  muscles  through  their  contraction  and  relaxation, 

representing neuromuscular activities. Therefore, controlling the robotic arm  via the muscles of 

the human arm using sEMG signals is considered to be one of the most significant methods. The 

wireless  Myo  gesture  armband  is  used  to  record  sEMG  signals  from  the  forearm.  In  order  to 

analyze these signals, the pattern recognition system is  employed, which consists of three main 

parts:  segmentation,  feature  extraction,  and  classification.  Overlap  technique  is  chosen  for 

segmenting part of the signal. Six time domain features (MAV, WL, RMS, AR, ZC, and SSC) are 

extracted  from  each  segment. The  classifiers  (SVM,  LDA,  and  KNN)  are  employed  to  enable 

comparison between them in order to obtain optimum accuracy of the system. The results show 

that the SVM achieves higher system accuracy at 96.57 %, compared to LDA reaching 96.01 %, 

and 92.67 % accuracy achieved by KNN.

Introduction  

The electrical signal produced through contraction or relaxation of muscles which are ruled by the 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nervous  system  are  called  Electromyography  (EMG)  signals.  This  signal  depends  on  the 

physiological and anatomical characteristic of muscles and is considered to be a complex signal. 

The surface electromyography (sEMG) are EMG signals that collect the electrical signals of the 

muscle activity through placing the electrodes on the surface of the skin. Fig. 1 shows the surface 

electromyography (sEMG) signals that start with the low amplitude, which changes with muscle 

contraction activity [1]. 

Detection of sEMG signals are useful and improve important methodologies in many applications. 

Such applications are becoming increasingly in demand, in spheres such as biomedical engineering 

[2], the robotics arm and automation control systems [3,4]. 

The measurements and precise representations of the sEMG signals depend on the characteristics 

of the electrodes and their relationship with the skin of the forearm or shoulder, and are affected 

by the amplifier design, and the transition of the sEMG signals from analogue to digital format [5]. 

A raw sEMG signal has the maximum voltage of (0-2) mV, and a range of frequency approximately 

between (0-1000) Hz, but the important frequency that contains useful information lies between 

(20-500) Hz [6]. The sEMG signals can be acquired by positioning surface electrodes on the arm 

or the shoulder.  

There are two main types of the electrodes that acquire sEMG signals: needle electrodes (inside 

the  skin)  and  surface  electrodes,  with  no  significant  variance  between  them  [7]. There  are  two 

types of surface electrodes: wired like Myoware muscle sensor or wireless such as Myo gesture 

control armband. They differ in features, the most important of which is  the sampling rate. All 

these types of electrodes are considered as data acquisition equipment. 

Data  acquisition  represents  the  first  stage  in  detecting  sEMG  signals  and  recording  them, 

processing them through removing noise and unwanted parts of the signal.

The pattern recognition represents the backbone of sEMG signals analysis and processing. In order 

to  move the assisting devices, such as  robotic arms or prosthetic limbs,  the pattern recognition 

system is mostly used to obtain gestures of muscle activity. A pattern recognition system consists 

of three main stages: segmentation, feature extraction selection, and classification [7–9].  

In the segmentation stage, the sEMG signals are segmented into slices (windows) or time-slots to 

extract  features  for  each  window,  during  the  muscles’  activity.  Two  very  important  points  in 

segmentation are the length  of segment  and segment schema; these  need to  be specified  as the 

accuracy is affected by them.  

The features extraction stage  is  when  suitable features  are selected  to  extract  information  from 

each  window  of  the  sEMG  signals.  The  features  of  sEMG  signals  can  be  categorized  by  time 

domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency transform. Time domain (TD) features extraction 

is  easy  to  implement  and  does  not  require  a  high  computational  cost.  TD  features,  such  as 

waveform length (WL), mean absolute value (MAV), autoregressive coefficients (AR), slope sign 

changes (SSC), and zero crossings (ZC) are extracted from data related to amplitude and frequency 

of the raw sEMG signals. In contrast, frequency domain (FD) features are extracted widely using 

power  spectral  density  (PSD).  The  FD  features  include  median  frequency,  mean  power,  peak 

frequency, maximum amplitude and variance of the central frequency. The Time-Frequency (TF) 

transform like wavelet transform (WT) and short time Fourier transform (STFT). The TF features 

require higher computational cost and are more complex compared to TD features [10,11].  

In  the  classification  stage,  the  appropriate  classifier  algorithm  is  chosen  for  the  system.  The 

classifier  will  determine  the  intended  movement  depending  on  the  feature-class  set  previously 

defined. The classifiers are applied to distinguish different sets of the features. Many techniques 

are  used  for  the  classification  purpose,  including  well-known  algorithms,  such  as  linear 

4 

 
discriminant  analysis  (LDA),  support  vector  machines  (SVM),  k-nearest  neighbour  (KNN), 

multilayer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural networks (ANN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and 

fuzzy logic (FL) [12].  

Researchers and practitioners focus on analysing and processing the sEMG signals to improve the 

efficiency of information acquired from sEMG signals using different methods. The researchers in 

[6] reviewed the effect of the electrodes’ positions on the efficiency of sEMG signals and selected 

the best locations and placement for them. Researchers in [13] compared the effect of using Myo 

gesture armband and Myoware electrodes for data acquisition on accuracy of gestures, although 

Myo armband has bandwidth limitation. Studies abound in the field of sEMG pattern recognition 

systems.  Whereas  the  studies  in  [14,15]  competed  to  find  a  combination  of  features  with 

classification  related  to  muscles,  to  obtain  better  accuracy  for  the  system,  the  authors  in  [11] 

compared the time domain and frequency domain features. Additionally, the researchers in [16] 

designed  their  own  classification  through  fuzzy  approach,  whilst  [17]  used  a  neural  network 

approach and [18] used both neuro-fuzzy classifiers. 

The aim of this study is  to use Myo gesture control armband as data acquisition of raw sEMG 

signals rather than Myoware muscle sensor to move the robotic arm (5DoF) in real-time mode, 

despite its limitation in bandwidth. Overlapped scheme segmentation and MAV, RMS, WL, AR, 

ZC, and SSC as features extraction, were selected for analysis and processing of raw sEMG signals. 

This paper also compared three types of classifiers, LDA, KNN, and SVM, to distinguish seven 

arm movements (wrist right, wrist left, wrist up, wrist down, fist, rest hand and open hand). Finally, 

the accuracy of the system for each classifier is computed.   

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the background of data acquisition 

and  pattern  recognition  system.  Section  3  explains  the  suggested  methodology  to  control  the 

5 

 
movement of the robotic arm. The experiments in offline mode and online mode are presented in 

Section 4. Section 5 explores the simulation results and comparison of the different classifiers. 

Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 6. 

Theoretical Background  

The Myo gesture control armband is a wireless wearable technology designed by Thalmic Labs in 

2014 with five gestures of hand. It has three parts: gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer. 

Each part contains the three axes of x, y, z, and all these parts represent the inertial measurement 

unit (IMU). The Myo gesture armband contains two batteries in different locations; each battery 

has  a  capacity  of  260  mAh  and  an  operating  voltage  range  of  1.7  to  3.3  volts.  The  sampling 

frequency of Myo gesture control armband is 200 Hz. It is used for medical purposes, automation 

systems applications, and to control the robotic arm. Moreover, this product is supported by SDK 

kit, which enables communication between the Myo gesture armband and other applications, such 

as MathWorks’ MATLAB[19,20]. 

In the segmentation section, there are many approaches used to cut off the sEMG signals, such as 

the adjacent scheme and overlap scheme. The scheme used in this paper is an overlapping scheme. 

This type of segmentation divides the sEMG signals into equal time slot windows which overlap 

with each other. Fig. 2 explains slotted windows and how they overlap. Classification decision (D) 

in overlap technique can be calculated as: 

                                              𝐷 =

𝑇𝑛𝑒𝑤 + 𝜏 

 (1) 

where  𝑇𝑎  represents  the  analysis  window  length,  𝑇𝑛𝑒𝑤  represents  window  increment  and  τ 

represents processing time [10,12]. 

Furthermore, in this research, six features are extracted for each window: RMS, MAV, SSC, ZC, 

AR, and WL. All of them are time domain features. In the following, the symbols 𝒇𝒌 and N are the 

6 

 
sEMG signals in each segment, and the number of samples of the sEMG signals, respectively. The 

informative data that each feature represents is as follows [10,14]: 

1-  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS):  It  has  frequency  related  features,  which  represent  the square 

root of the mean square of the segment. The mathematical representation of RMS is: 

                                               RMS =√1

2-  Mean  Absolute  Value  (MAV):  It  has  amplitude  related  features,  which  represent  the 

calculation of the mean absolute value of the segment. The mathematical representation of MAV 

is:

3-  Slope Sign Changes (SSC): It has frequency related features, which detect changes in the 

slope  sign  of  the  sEMG  signal  and  count  them. The  mathematical  representation  of  SSC  is  as 

follows: 

                                               SSC = ∑

𝑛−1

|(𝑓𝑘 − 𝑓𝑘−1

)(𝑓𝑘  −   𝑓𝑘+1)|  

        (4)          

4-  Waveform Length (WL): It has amplitude related features, which represent the cumulative 

length of the sEMG waveform over the time segment. The mathematical representation of WL is 

as follows: 

WL =  ∑

𝑁−1
𝑘=1

 |𝑓𝑘+1 −  𝑓𝑘|

                                                  (5)  

5-  Zero Crossings (ZC): It has frequency related features, which represent counts of how much 

signal amplitude cross the zero amplitude over time segment. It is measuring the frequency shift 

and  shows  the  number  of  signal  sign  variations.  The  mathematical  representation  of  ZC  is  as 

follows: 

ZC=∑

𝑁−1
𝑘=1

𝑠𝑛𝑔(𝑓𝑘 𝑓𝑘+1

𝑠𝑛𝑔(𝑥) =   {

1      if 𝑥  ≥  1  
0     otherwise

where α is threshold. 

6-  Auto Regression (AR): This represents the linear combination of previous windows plus the 

error term. The mathematical representation of AR is as follows: 

  𝑥𝑛 = ∑

𝑝
𝑘=1

 𝑎𝑘 𝑓𝑛−𝑘 +

𝑒𝑛 

                                                  (7) 

where n = 0, 1... N-1, 𝑎𝑘 is the AR model coefficient, 𝑝  is the AR model’s order, 𝑒𝑛 is the residual 

white noise. 

Finally,  the  present  study  adopts  three  types  of  well-known  classifier  algorithms,  which  are: 

support  vector  machines  (SVM),  linear  discriminant  analysis  (LDA),  and  K-nearest  neighbour 

(KNN). The basic concept of SVM is to find a hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes and 

determines the data on which class area exists. In contrast, KNN depends on the class of (k) point 

neighbours to determine the class of the data. The LDA model estimates the mean and variance of 

data for each class. 

The key point of the successful system is how to choose the appropriate features to support the 

classifier. The accuracy of the system depends on the number of correct predictions of the classifier 

divided by the number of total predictions, measured in percentage [10].

Methodology and Hardware Components 
The system which was designed consists of three main parts: data acquisition, pattern recognition 

algorithm, and the output; the latter will be discussed in detail later. Fig. 3 shows all parts of the 

proposed system. 

 Data Acquisition and Synchronization  

The Myo gesture control armband is used as data acquisition equipment for recording the training 

8 

 
  
 
and  testing  set  of  sEMG  signals.  It  uses  wireless  sEMG  electrodes  (sensors)  that  surround  the 

forearm and detect the electrical signals of muscle activities. It is a commercially ready product 

that is suitable for recording sEMG signals and the spatial data related to the trend and motion of 

the user’s forearm.  

It consists of eight sEMG steel medical sensors, which are stainless (each sensor represents one 

channel). It has advantages over other sEMG sensors because no cables are required, the hands 

can be freely moved, it is easy to wear, relatively cheap, small in size, and lightweight, weighing 

only 93 g.  

The  Myo  armband  has  two  LEDs;  each  LED  indicates  a  specific  situation.  The  status  LED 

indicates a Myo gesture armband connected to a computer via Bluetooth  and appears in  a blue 

colour. This colour changes to orange when the Myo armband is charged. The logo LED indicates 

established  communication  between  Myo  gesture  armband  and  another  application,  such  as 

MathWorks’ MATLAB. If the LED flashes, it indicates that there is no established connection. In 

this case, the Myo armband moves a little for reconnection. For people whose hands are not too 

large,  the  flex,  the  adjustable  band,  is  used  to  reduce  the  size  of  Myo  gesture  armband.  Fig.  4 

presents the parts of Myo gesture control armband. 

To  begin,  the  installation  of  the  Myo  connection  package  is  made  on  a  PC  to  guarantee  the 

connection between Myo gesture armband and a computer via Bluetooth. The TDM64-GCC-4.9.2, 

MinGW-w64-4.9.2, and Myo-SDK-win-0.9.0 packages are installed to establish the connection 

between  Myo  gesture  armband  and  MATLAB  R2017. After  completing  all  necessary  package 

installations, the synchronization between Myo armband and MATLAB R2017 is a necessary step 

before recording sEMG signals. The electrodes (sensors) of the Myo gesture armband senses and 

records the sEMG signals. 

9 

 
Seven recorded gestures for each training set and testing set are made. Each gesture repeats four 

times and holds for five seconds. Further, each set starts and ends with a rest hand gesture, thus 

the length of each set is 145 seconds. Fig. 5 shows the eight channels of the raw sEMG signals that 

are recorded by Myo gesture armband. 

Usually, the collected sEMG signals contain many types of noises due to ambient noise, motion 

artefact, inherent noise in electronics equipment, and inherent instability of signal. The ambient 

noise is originated due to radiation of electromagnetic devices, while the motion artefact noise is 

caused  by  the  interface  between  the  electrode  and  the  skin.  The  noise  generated  by  electronic 

devices, as a result, is called the inherent noise. The inherent instability of signal occurs due to the 

effects of the sEMG signals caused by motor units firing rate for muscles. When using the Myo 

gesture  armband,  practically  the  noise  ratio  in  sEMG  signals  is  low,  which  does  not  affect  the 

sEMG data. This feature considers one importance of features in Myo armband. The sEMG signals 

voltage are very small in nature, about (0-2) mV. The Myo gesture armband amplifies the sEMG 

signals so that they can be easily handled. 

 Pattern recognition system 

The pattern recognition system consists of three stages, as illustrated in Fig. 3. It is used to analyse 

and process the sEMG signals to distinguish seven hand gestures which are: wrist right, wrist left, 

wrist up, wrist down, fist, open hand, and rest hand, as shown in Fig. 6. 

 Segmentation 

The overlap segmentation technique is used in this study. The window length of sEMG signals 

plays an important role in classification accuracy and the delay time to process sEMG signals in 

real-time. When the window length is relatively small, the classification accuracy will be lower, 

because  the  information  is  more  distorted.  As  a  consequence,  it  is  difficult  to  extract  useful 

10 

 
information  from  each  window.  In contrast, if the window length  gradually increases, the time 

delay  will  also  increase,  as  well  as  the  classification  accuracy,  to  a  certain  extent,  until  the 

continuation in the increase no longer affects the accuracy of the system. Therefore, the trade-off 

between the accuracy and delay time should be balanced to guarantee a high accuracy and low 

delay time. 

In  this  work,  practically  selected  window  size  (win  size  =  51  samples)  and  window  increment 

(win_inc = 25 samples) were used for the training set and testing set. 

Feature Extraction 

After segmentation of the sEMG signals into windows of equal size, the types of features to be 

extracted from each window of sEMG signals  were selected, according to those considered the 

most important in guaranteeing a high accuracy of separation gestures. The information cannot be 

obtained for features from individual samples of sEMG signals.  

In this paper, the time domain features (MAV, RMS, WL, AR, ZC, and SSC) are selected for ease 

of implementation and no need for high computational resources. These six features were extracted 

from each window for each channel of the sEMG signals; as a result, the features matrix would be 

formed. The number of the rows of the matrix represents the total number of windows of the sEMG 

data, while the number of the columns represents the total number of the features for all channels. 

Tables 1, 2 and 3 explain the feature effectiveness in each channel for each type of classifier. The 

less effective features are preferably deleted to decrease computational time, especially in  real-

time. The SSC feature has less effect on the classification accuracy, as shown in Tables 1, 2, and 

3, and was therefore removed from real-time implementation. 

 Classification 

Three types of classifiers are used in the system: SVM, LDA, and KNN with k = 3 for comparison 

11 

 
to  obtain  the  highest  system  accuracy  among  them.  The  prediction  of  the  classifier  would  be 

applied in the next stage as commands for the controller of the robotic arm. If any channel has low 

efficiency and has little effect on the overall accuracy of the system, it can be removed to gain 

higher speed computational time, especially in real-time mode, as in the case of channels 2 and 5. 

Fig. 7 shows the results of applying all selected features extracted with each type of classifier for 

each channel of sEMG signals. 

System modes  

The system works in two modes: offline mode and online mode (real-time). The offline mode is 

developed for calculating system accuracy and improving system performance, whilst the online 

mode is used for moving the robotic arm in real time. These two modes have been implemented 

through the MATLAB R2017 program. 

 Offline mode 

The Myo gesture armband should be worn on the forearm in the same manner, every time it is used 

to record the training and testing set, so as to guarantee the placements of its sensors in the same 

position. In order to avoid random readings, this point must be considered during data recording. 

In this study, the Myo armband is worn on the right forearm so that the status LED is on the sole 

of the forearm and towards the fingers of the hand, as shown in Fig. 8. 

Myo gesture armband was used in this study to collect raw sEMG signals from all channels, during 

muscle contraction activity. The information acquired or collected by Myo armband is transmitted 

to the computer via Bluetooth for analysis and processing using MATLAB R2017. The duration 

of the recording of the training set is 145 seconds, and the same duration for recording the testing 

set. The window size in both the training and testing set is 51 samples with 25 overlapping samples. 

12 

 
 
The number of features extracted for each set for all channels is 56, which equals the number of 

Myo channels (eight channels) multiplied by the number of features (six features: RMS, MAV, 

SSC, ZC, WL, and AR with order = 2) per window (segment). 

Three vectors are calculated for each set; the first vector of the training set is a feature training 

vector composed of six features extracted from each window for each channel. The second vector 

is a class training vector representing movements of the training set. The third vector is an index 

training vector representing the index of starting the movement in the set. A good synchronization 

between class training vector and index training vector improves movement classification accuracy. 

For the best synchronization, the programmable model was developed in the MATLAB R2017 to 

improve the accuracy of the system.  

Additionally, the vectors feature testing, class testing, and index testing, calculated from the testing 

set using the same procedure applied to the training set. The classifier will compare feature testing 

with  feature  training  in  order  to  expect  the  predicted  class  of  movements. The  accuracy  of  the 

system is calculated as equation (8), where the number of correct predictions is the correct output 

from the compression of predictions class with class testing, while the total prediction is all the 

expected movements from the classifier. The accuracy of the system using this procedure with the 

KNN classifier was 92.67 %, while it was 96.01 % with LDA classifier, and 96.57 % with SVM 

classifier. 

 Online mode 

In  the  real-time  mode,  the  Aideepen  ROT3U  5DOF  aluminium  robotic  arm,  Due  Arduino 

microcontroller,  HP  laptop  computer,  and  Myo  gesture  armband  comprise  the  hardware 

components of the system. The Aideepen ROT3U robotic arm has a rotation angle of 180 degrees, 

a height of 42cm (holder closed), clamp maximum opening of 4.5cm, and widest distance of the 

13 

 
holder of 10cm. It consists of five servo motors type MG 996R; each servo motor has an operating 

voltage of 4.8 V to 7.2 V, with running current of 500 mA – 900 mA (6 V), operating speed: 0.17 

s/60º (4.8 V), 0.14 s/60º (6 V), and torque: 9.4 kgf·cm (4.8 V), 11 kgf·cm (6 V). Due Arduino 

specifications are: operating voltage: 3.3V, digital I/O pins: 54 (of which 12 provide PWM output), 

analogue input pins: 12, DC current for 5V pin: 800 mA, flash memory: 512 KB all available for 

the user applications, SRAM: 96 KB (two banks: 64KB and 32KB), and clock speed: 84 MHz. HP 

laptop computer specifications are: processor: Core i5 – 2.3 GHz, RAM: 8 GB. Fig. 9 shows the 

Due Arduino and robotic arm. 

To move the robotic arm as a human arm movement, the Myo armband records the sEMG signals 

and transmits them to the computer via Bluetooth. The pattern recognition analyses these signals 

and processes it through MATLAB R2017 software to distinguish these movements. The output 

of pattern recognition is a vector of predicted movement; each value in this vector represents one 

gesture. To guarantee a smooth movement of the robotic arm, the majority vote is applied to this 

vector. Majority vote produces final movements that have been predicted most frequently by the 

classifier. Due Arduino receives one of the predictions each time to move the robotic arm, as a 

final result illustrated in Fig. 10. 

The  response  time  of  robotic  arm  movement  as  a  result  of  moving  human  arm  gesture  is  an 

important factor in the success measurement of the system. In order to improve the system response, 

delay time should be reduced. There are many types of delay time in the system, such as Bluetooth 

transfer delay, computational time of pattern recognition, and Arduino processing time. Bluetooth 

transfer delay could not be reduced, because it is a standard protocol used by the manufacturing 

company of Myo gesture armband. The computational time of pattern recognition can be reduced 

depending on offline mode results; therefore, it is possible to delete factors that do not significantly 

14 

 
affect accuracy, such as channels 2 and 5 and the SSC feature, as illustrated in Tables 1, 2, and 3 

and Fig. 7, respectively. 

The clock speed of Arduino (microcontroller) plays an important role in processing time; therefore, 

to improve the response time of the system, it is better to select a high clock speed for Arduino. 

Early experiments used UNO Arduino, which has a clock speed of 16 MHz. Then it was replaced 

by DUE Arduino that has a clock speed of 84 MHz to reduce delay time and also to improve the 

response time of the robotic arm. In this mode, the testing set acquired from the Myo armband is 

directly cut off into segments and the features testing is calculated for these segments. Furthermore, 

in the classification stage, the classifier expects the predicted vector, by comparing feature testing 

with  feature  training,  as  previously  defined. Then  the  majority  vote  is  applied  and  passes  each 

value from it to Arduino, which is connected by serial port with the computer to move the robotic 

arm. Fig. 10 represents the circuit diagram of all parts of the proposed system and how to connect 

them. 

Results and Discussion  
This section will discuss the results of the experiments and the factors that affect the accuracy of 

the  system. The  influential  factors  are  the  length  of  the  window,  type  of  features  selected  and 

classifier, the position of electrodes or sensors on the forearm (Myo armband wearing style), and 

the number of channels that are used in the Myo gesture armband. 

Experiment one: effect of window length on system accuracy 

The length of the sEMG signal segment affects the accuracy of classification and the delay time 

of the system, as explained previously in the segmentation section. In this experiment the window 

size changes from 25 to 120 samples; during the duration between (25-100) samples, the accuracy 

of  classification  increases  significantly,  but  during  the  duration  between  (100-120)  samples, 

increasing window size does not lead to a noticeable increase in accuracy. The best results were 

15 

 
obtained when the window size is 51 samples, taking into consideration the real-time constraint 

that should not exceed 300ms for the best response time in online mode. This is shown in Fig. 11, 

which is obtained from deploying 6 selected features extracted with SVM classifier. 

 Experiment two: effect of extracting feature selection on system accuracy 

Selection  of  features  is  very  important  to  extract  information  from  sEMG  signals  because  the 

classifier can distinguish between movements based on extracted information of these features. In 

this experiment, the accuracy of the system was 96.57 %, 96.01, and 92.67 % for SVM, LDA, and 

KNN  respectively,  for  six  features  extracted  and  eight  channels.  By  observing  offline  results 

(Tables 1, 2, and 3), the WL feature had a high effect on the accuracy of the system, but the SSC 

feature  had  little  effect  on  the  system’s  accuracy;  therefore,  this  feature  can  be  removed  from 

feature vector set to reduce computational cost in order to reduce processing time. Thus, the online 

mode depended on five features: AR, ZC, WL, RMS, and MAV. Table 4 explains the accuracy of 

the system before and after removal of the SSC feature. 

 Experiment three: effect of position of electrodes on system accuracy 

The Myo gesture armband is a bracelet shape. Each time the Myo armband is worn differently, the 

sensor location changes, thus  the accuracy  of the system also changes.  Consequently, the  Myo 

armband should be worn consistently in the same way when recording sEMG signals in the offline 

mode and in real-time to ensure that positions of electrodes do not change. The Myo armband was 

worn in several different styles to obtain the best accuracy. The results show that wearing the Myo 

armband as in Fig. 8 in the offline experiment section achieved the best accuracy. 

Experiment four: effect of number of channels on system accuracy 

Some of the Myo armband sensors will be positioned on muscles that have a little electrical activity 

16 

 
 
which will impact on the value of information collected from that sensor. Therefore, by observing 

offline results, it was apparent that channels 2 and 5 had the poorest impact on the accuracy of the 

system. Therefore,  to  minimize the  computational  cost,  these  can  be  removed  from  the  pattern 

recognition system. Thus, in online mode, six channels instead of eight channels are considered. 

Table 5 shows the impact of channels 2 and 5 on the system accuracy.  

In  summation,  this  paper’s  proposed  real-time  robotic  arm  control  depends  on  sEMG  signals 

collected by Myo gestures armband model based on six channels (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8) and uses 

overlap segmentation technique with the window size of 51 samples and 25 overlapping samples. 

The  five  features  which  were  extracted  from  each  segment  are WL, AR,  ZC,  MAV,  and  RMS. 

SVM  classifier  was  deployed  and  the  Due Arduino  connected  with  (5DoF)  robotic  arm.  The 

response time was satisfied with the proposed model with an accuracy of over 95 %. Table 6 lists 

the final results of the proposed model. The results of this study were compared with other studies’ 

results, as shown in Table 7. In this comparison, the movement types and the style of Myo armband 

wear differ. 

Conclusion 

A  new  model  proposed  in  this  paper  to  move  the  robotic  arm  (5DoF)  in  real-time  depends  on 

recognizing human forearm gestures as based on sEMG signals collected by wireless Myo gesture 

armband. The model is  composed of three stages:  signal  acquisition, signal  pattern recognition 

system, and controlling the robotic arm. The following conclusions are obtained: 

  Using  a wearable  wireless  Myo  gesture armband adds flexibility and free movement  with  a 

good signal to the system. 

17 

 
  Window  size  in  segmentation  affects  delay  time  and  system  accuracy.  There  is  an  inverse 

relationship between window size and time delay and a fairly direct relationship between it and 

system accuracy. 

  The  set  of  feature  extraction  of  time  domain  (WL,  AR,  MAV,  RMS,  and  ZC)  produced 

satisfactory system results for accuracy and time response. 

  The SSC time domain feature has little effect on system accuracy while the WL feature has the 

highest effect. 

  An  SVM  classifier  shows  good  accuracy  (95.27  %)  in  the  sEMG  signal  analysis  with  time 

domain feature extraction. LDA, on the other hand, has less accuracy (94.53 %) and KNN has 

the least accuracy (89.43 %). 

  The  comparison  in  Table  7  displays  the  converged  results.  It  proves  that  all  of  the  factors 

mentioned  during  this  study  have  a  clear  effect  on  the  ratio  of  the  accuracy  of  the  system, 

including the length of the window, the number and type of features extracted, and the number 

of movements classified. 

For future research in this field, a recommendation would be to adopt one of the control design 

methods in [21,22] to add more smoothness to the robotic arm movement.
