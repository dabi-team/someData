ABSTRACT

Context. Along several sight lines within the Milky Way ArH+ has been ubiquitously detected with only one detection in extragalactic
environments, namely along two sight lines in the redshift z = 0.89 absorber towards the lensed blazar PKS 1830-211. Being formed
in predominantly atomic gas by reactions between Ar+, which were initially ionised by cosmic rays and molecular hydrogen, ArH+
has been shown to be an excellent tracer of atomic gas as well as the impinging cosmic-ray ionisation rates.
Aims. In this work, we attempt to extend the observations of ArH+ in extragalactic sources to examine its use as a tracer of the atomic
interstellar medium (ISM) in these galaxies.
Methods. We report the detection of ArH+ towards two luminous nearby galaxies, NGC 253 and NGC 4945, and the non-detection
towards Arp 220 observed using the SEPIA660 receiver on the APEX 12 m telescope. In addition, the two sidebands of this receiver
= 11,0 − 10,1 transitions of another atomic gas tracer p-H2O+ at 607.227 GHz with the ArH+ line,
allowed us to observe the NKa Kc
simultaneously. We modelled the optically thin spectra of both species and compared their observed line proﬁles with that of other
well-known atomic gas tracers such as OH+ and o-H2O+ and diﬀuse and dense molecular gas tracers HF and CO, respectively.
Results. Assuming that the observed absorption from the ArH+, OH+, and H2O+ molecules are aﬀected by the same ﬂux of cosmic
rays, we investigate the properties of the diﬀerent cloud layers. Based on a steady-state analysis of the chemistry of these three species
and using statistical equilibrium calculations, we estimate the molecular fraction traced by ArH+ to be ∼ 10−3 and ﬁnd that ArH+
resides in gas volumes with low electron densities. We further study the ortho-to-para ratio of H2O+ and ﬁnd that the derived ratios
do not signiﬁcantly deviate from the equilibrium value of three with spin temperatures greater than 15 and 24 K.

1. Introduction

Over the duration of its operation, from 2009–2013, the Her-
schel Space Observatory (HSO) enabled observations of the fun-
damental rotational transitions of a variety of molecular hy-
drides and hydride ions, several of them being newly discov-
ered. Many of these transitions cannot be observed from the
ground at all because these high frequency lines lie in parts of
the sub-millimetre (sub-mm) and far-infrared (FIR) wavelength
range that are blocked by absorption in the Earth’s atmosphere.
One of the many highlights of the Herschel mission, and a real
surprise, has been the fortuitous detection of the J = 1 − 0 and
J = 2 − 1 transitions of argonium, ArH+ , in emission towards
the Crab Nebula by Barlow et al. (2013). Following it, Schilke
et al. (2014) were able to successfully assign, previously uniden-
tiﬁed absorption features near 617 GHz to ArH+, along the lines-
of-sight (LOS) towards ﬁve star-forming regions. It turned out
that, fortunately, the J = 1 − 0 transition of ArH+ lies at a wave-
length that is accessible with ground-based telescopes at high
mountain sites under exceptional weather conditions, and Ja-
cob et al. (2020) were recently able to detect ArH+ towards
seven more sight lines in the inner Galaxy using the Atacama
Pathﬁnder Experiment (APEX) 12 m sub-mm telescope. All of
these observations conﬁrm, as ﬁrst discussed by Schilke et al.
(2014), that the ArH+ molecular ion exclusively probes diﬀuse
atomic material and that it is ubiquitously present in the Milky

Way. This raises questions on the existence and nature of ArH+
in extragalactic sources.

Towards external galaxies, both the ArH+ J = 1 − 0 and
J = 2 − 1 lines have remained undetected in single side band ob-
servations covering their corresponding line frequencies, which
were carried out using the Herschel Spectral and Photometric
Imaging REceiver (SPIRE, Griﬃn et al. 2010) on board the
HSO. The apparent non-detection of these lines is likely caused
by a combination of eﬀects including smearing by the spectrom-
eter which results in unresolved spectral line proﬁles alongside
eﬀects of blending from nearby lines (such as HCN-v2 (7-6) at
623.3635 GHz and H2O 22,0–21,1 at 1228.79 GHz). In addition,
the ringing noise introduced by uncertainties in the ﬁtting and
subtraction of strong lines in the SPIRE FTS spectra using sinc
functions can aﬀect the line proﬁles of the underlying weak ab-
sorption. It is for these reasons that ArH+ has remained unde-
tected in observations of extragalactic sources other than PKS
1830−211. Therefore, very little is known about the nature and
abundance of ArH+ outside of the Milky Way. To date, there ex-
ists only a single detection of ArH+ in extragalactic space, which
was carried out by Müller et al. (2015). Using the Atacama Large
Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA, Wootten & Thomp-
son 2009), these authors were able to detect the J = 1 − 0 tran-
sitions of 36ArH+ and 38ArH+ through the intermediate redshift

gravitational lens-magniﬁed blazar, PKS 1830−211 along two
diﬀerent sight lines.

Primarily residing in atomic gas with molecular hydrogen
fH2 , between 10−2 and 10−4 (Schilke et al. 2014;
fractions,
Neufeld & Wolﬁre 2016; Jacob et al. 2020), the abundance of
ArH+ is sensitive to the X-ray and cosmic-ray ﬂuxes that per-
meate the surrounding media as its formation is initiated by
the reaction between H2 and atomic argon ionised by either X-
rays and/or cosmic-ray particles. Therefore, observations of the
ground state transitions of ArH+ provide a unique tool for prob-
ing atomic gas and estimating ionisation rates. Regions perme-
ated by a high ﬂux of cosmic-rays can be heated by them to high
gas temperatures, which in turn can strongly inﬂuence the initial
conditions of star-formation and the initial mass function (IMF,
Papadopoulos et al. 2011).

In this paper we present our search for ArH+ towards three
luminous galaxies, Arp 220, NGC 253 and NGC 4945, using
the SEPIA660 receiver on the APEX 12 m telescope. Both sys-
tems have been extensively studied over a wide range of wave-
lengths. In particular, a plethora of molecules have been ob-
served towards these sources, including common hydrides and
their cations, for example, OH, OH+, H2O, H2O+ (González-
Alfonso et al. 2013; van der Tak et al. 2016; González-Alfonso
et al. 2018). Arp 220 is the archetypical ultra-luminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG). A merging system, it hosts two compact nu-
clei (Baan & Haschick 1995; Rodríguez-Rico et al. 2005) that
are surrounded by an immense amount of gas and dust (Scov-
ille et al. 1997; Engel et al. 2011) with dust temperatures be-
tween 90 and 160 K (Sakamoto et al. 2008) and a luminosity of
0.2–1 × 1012 L(cid:12). Notably, the intense starburst activity within the
dense interstellar medium (ISM) of its nuclear regions causes
stars to form at a rate of up to 50–100 M(cid:12) yr−1 (Smith et al.
1998), which is > 50 times that in the disk of the Milky Way
galaxy today (Robitaille & Whitney 2010) and ∼ 1000 times that
in its central molecular zone (Immer et al. 2012). NGC 253 is a
barred prototypical starburst galaxy part of the Sculptor group,
with an infrared luminosity of 1.7 × 1010 L(cid:12) (Radovich et al.
2001). Its strong nuclear starburst, drives a ∼ 100 pc-scale molec-
ular gas outﬂow/wind as seen, for example in observations of
CO (Bolatto et al. 2013a). It has been suggested that at the cen-
tre of this barred spiral a weak AGN coexists with the strong
starburst, an issue that is still under debate (for example see,
Müller-Sánchez et al. 2010; Gutiérrez et al. 2020). NGC 4945
is an infrared-bright galaxy with a Seyfert nucleus, signifying
an accreting supermassive black hole, in the Centaurus group
with a luminosity of 2.4 × 1010 L(cid:12) (Brock et al. 1988). It is the
brightest Seyfert 2 galaxy and hosts a deeply enshrouded AGN
at its centre which is revealed by X-ray emission in the 100-keV
sky (Iwasawa et al. 1993). The AGN is surrounded by a strongly
absorbing, inclined circumnuclear starburst ring with a radius of
∼ 50 pc (Chou et al. 2007). With comparable star-formation rates
of a few times M(cid:12)yr−1 (Bolatto et al. 2013a; Bendo et al. 2016)
the similarities (or lack thereof) in the abundances and gas prop-
erties traced by ArH+ in these sources will shed light on their
nuclear environments.

The observations are described in Sect. 2, followed by a qual-
itative and quantitative analysis of the data and a discussion of
the results in Sects. 3 and 4. Finally, in Sect. 5 we discuss our
main ﬁndings and summarise our results.

2. Observations

Using the Swedish-ESO PI (SEPIA660) receiver (Belitsky et al.
2018; Hesper et al. 2018) of the APEX 12 m sub-mm telescope,

Article number, page 2 of 16

we were able to carry out observations of the J = 1 − 0 tran-
sition of 36ArH+ (hereafter ArH+) between 2019 July and Au-
gust (Project Id: M9519C_103). The SEPIA660 receiver is a two
sideband (2SB), dual polarisation receiver that covers a band-
width of 8 GHz, per sideband, with a sideband rejection level
>15 dB. The observations were carried out in wobbler switching
mode, using a secondary wobbler throw of 180(cid:48)(cid:48) in azimuth at
a rate of 1.5 Hz. Combined with the atmospheric stability at the
high APEX site, this observing method allows reliable recovery
of the sources’ continuum levels. Properties of our source sam-
ple are summarised in Table 1.

We tuned the upper sideband (USB) to a frequency of
618.5 GHz to cover the ArH+ J = 1 − 0 transition at a rest fre-
quency of 617.525 GHz. This allowed us to simultaneously ob-
= 110 − 101, J = 3/2 − 1/2, and J = 3/2 − 3/2
serve the NKaKc
transitions of p-H2O+ at 604.678 and 607.227 GHz in the lower
sideband (LSB), centred at a frequency of 606.5 GHz. The USB
also covers an atmospheric absorption feature close to 620 GHz,
however falls just short of covering the corresponding J = 1 − 0
transition of 38ArH+ at 616.648 GHz. Our observations were car-
ried out under excellent weather conditions, with precipitable
water vapour (PWV) levels between 0.25 and 0.41 mm, corre-
sponding to an atmospheric transmission better than or compa-
rable to 0.5 in both sidebands and a mean system temperature of
1874 K, at 617 GHz. On average we spent a total (on+oﬀ) ob-
serving time of 4.6 hours towards each source. The typical half
power beam-width (HPBW) is 10.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 at 617 GHz. The HPBW
at this frequency corresponds 0.15 kpc and 0.19 kpc at the dis-
tances towards NGC 253 and NGC 4945, respectively. There-
fore, the beam probes only the nucleus and foreground disk gas
of these two galaxies. We converted the spectra into main-beam
brightness temperature scales by using an antenna forward ef-
ﬁciency, Feﬀ, of 0.95 and a main-beam eﬃciency, Beﬀ, of 0.41
(determined from observations of Mars). As a backend we used
an evolved version of the MPIfR built Fast Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (XFFTS, Klein et al. 2012) which provided, over
the entire 2×8 GHz bandwidth, a generic spectral resolution of
61 kHz (corresponding to 30 m s−1 at 617 GHz). The calibrated
spectra, smoothed to a velocity resolution appropriate for our
sources (∆υ ∼ 4.5 km s−1), were subsequently processed using
the GILDAS/CLASS software1 and ﬁrst order polynomial base-
lines were removed. Our search for ArH+ and p-H2O+ towards
Arp 220 was unsuccessful and we do not detect any lines in the
sideband down to a noise level of 5 mK at a spectral resolution
of 4.5 km s−1. Therefore, we do not include Arp 220 in our anal-
ysis but quote a 3σ upper limit of 15 mK for the ArH+ J = 1 − 0
and both p-H2O+ transitions in this source. The non-detection
of ArH+ towards Arp 220 might be because this system’s X-ray
emission is not capable of ionising Ar or a combined eﬀect of
sensitivity and the low continuum level.

In addition to the results of the ArH+ and p-H2O+ ob-
servations newly presented in this work, we use complemen-
tary archival HIFI/Herschel data of other well known tracers of
atomic gas, namely, OH+ and o-H2O+, which were acquired as
a part of the Herschel EXtraGALactic (HEXGAL) guaranteed
time key project (PI: R. Güsten), published by van der Tak et al.
(2016) and also of the diﬀuse molecular gas tracer HF observed
by Monje et al. (2014). The HIFI HPBWs at the frequencies of
the OH+, o-H2O+, and HF transitions studied in the above works
are comparable to one another at 22(cid:48)(cid:48), 20(cid:48)(cid:48), and 17(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively.

The spectrum of the N, J = 1, 2 − 0, 1 OH+ transitions near
971 GHz towards NGC 253, observed under the HEXGAL
project (presented by van der Tak et al. 2016) is saturated over
almost the entire range of heliocentric velocities associated with
the central parts of the galaxy, between 185 and 235 km s−1.
This makes the subsequent determination of OH+ column den-
sities from the observed spectrum extremely diﬃcult. There-
fore, in this work, towards NGC 253 we instead use observa-
tions of the N, J = 1, 1 − 0, 1 transitions of OH+ near 1033 GHz
observed in 2010 July using the now decommissioned dual-
channel 1.05 THz receiver on the APEX 12 m telescope (Leinz
et al. 2010). The observations were carried out under excellent
weather conditions with PWV between 0.15 and 0.25 mm. The
fast Fourier Transform spectrometer (FFTS, Klein et al. 2006)
provided a spectral resolution of ∼ 0.053 km s−1 (183 kHz) over
a 2.4 GHz bandwidth for the 1.05 THz channel which was later
smoothed to a velocity resolution of 4.5 km s−1. The spectra
were calibrated on main-beam temperature scale using a main-
beam eﬃciency of (∼ 21 ± 7)% as determined from observations
of Uranus. The observed spectrum shows a narrow absorption
feature at 320 km s−1 which likely arises from blending with
contaminant species along the sight line. In order to conﬁrm
the association of this feature to a species other than OH+ we
cross-checked the 1033 GHz OH+ spectrum along the LOS to-
wards the extensively studied Galactic source, Sgr B2 (M), ob-
served under the HEXOS Herschel guaranteed time key project
(Bergin et al. 2010). From this comparison we assign this ab-
sorption feature near 1032.783 GHz as being likely associated
with the 13CH2CHCN (2110,11–209,12) transition. In addition we
also observe a weaker absorption feature near 12 km s−1 which
potentially arises from the high-lying (379,29–376,32) transition of
C2H5CN at 1033.868 GHz. Furthermore the high excitation lines
of similar complex organic molecules (COMs) found in ALMA
Band 6 and 7 observations towards NGC 253 by Mangum et al.
(2019) makes it likely that the OH+ spectrum at 1033 GHz is
contaminated by the high-lying transitions of these species.

We also compare the line proﬁles of the ArH+ line with those
of the HI 21 cm line and subsequently determine the ArH+ abun-
dances. For this we use archival interferometric data of HI ab-
sorption and emission for NGC 253 and NGC 4945, observed us-
ing the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) with beam
sizes of 4.(cid:48)(cid:48)9 × 10.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 and 7.(cid:48)(cid:48)9 × 9.(cid:48)(cid:48)4, respectively. The HI column
densities were determined as described in Winkel et al. (2017),
by combining the absorption proﬁles with emission line data.
The results of this HI analysis, resulting in determinations of the
optical depth, spin temperatures, and HI column densities along
with the corresponding HI emission and absorption spectra is
given in Appendix A. In addition we also present CO J = (1 − 0)
emission spectra towards NGC 253 and NGC 4945, previously
published in Houghton et al. (1997) and Curran et al. (2001),

respectively, for comparison2. In both cases the spectra were ob-
tained using the Swedish–ESO 15 m Sub-millimetre Telescope
(SEST) at La Silla, Chile with a beam size of 43(cid:48)(cid:48) at 115 GHz.
The spectroscopic parameters of all the lines described above are
summarised in Table 2.
We analysed the stability of the quoted continuum levels at
617 GHz across scans (or time) and found the ﬂuctuations to lie
within 14%. This is illustrated in Fig B.1 and is not surprising
as the observations were carried out using a wobbling secondary
with a fast switching rate which guaranteed the removal of any
drifts that may arise due to atmospheric instabilities. Further-
more, we ﬁnd the 617 GHz continuum ﬂux to be well correlated
with the continuum ﬂux at 870 µm observed using the Large
APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) at the APEX telescope
presented in Weiß et al. (2008) which leads us to conclude that
the continuum levels used are fairly reliable.

3. Results

3.1. Spectral line proﬁles

The calibrated and baseline-subtracted spectra towards NGC 253
and NGC 4945 are presented in Figure 1. In the following para-
graphs we qualitatively discuss the observed ArH+ and p-H2O+
features and compare them to spectra of OH+, o-H2O+, HF, CO,
and HI. As mentioned above, our tuning setup simultaneously
covers both the J = 3/2 − 1/2 as well as the J = 3/2 − 3/2
ﬁne structure transitions from the (11,0 − 10,1) level of p-H2O+
at 604.684 and 607.225 GHz. However, towards both NGC 253
and NGC 4945, we do not detect the J = 3/2 − 1/2 ﬁne struc-
ture transition near 604 GHz above a noise level of ∼3 and 7 mK
at a spectral resolution of 4.5 km s−1, respectively. Therefore
this transition is not discussed any further in the text. For both
NGC 253 and NGC 4945, we assume molecular source sizes of
∼20(cid:48)(cid:48), which were previously determined by Wang et al. (2004);
Aladro et al. (2015); Pérez-Beaupuits et al. (2018) and references
therein, using molecular emission maps of abundant species like
CO. The beam sizes of all the species studied here with the ex-
ception of CO (see Table 2) are either smaller than or comparable
to this source size.

3.1.1. NGC 253
The ArH+ line proﬁle towards NGC 253 displays blueshifted ab-
sorption with respect to the systemic velocity of the source at
243 km s−1, covering a velocity range from ∼ 90 to 270 km s−1
and centred at a velocity of 210 (±3.7) km s−1. For compari-
son, other species like OH+, o-H2O+ and HF all show spectra

Notes. The spectroscopic data are taken from the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS, Müller et al. 2005). The H2O+ frequen-
cies were actually reﬁned considering astronomical observations (see Appendix A of Muller et al. 2016), for which the upper level energies are
given with respect to the ground state of p-H2O+ (NKa Kc
= 10,1). For the rest frequencies, the numbers in parentheses give the uncertainty in the

with P-Cygni proﬁles with the absorption seen at comparable
blueshifted velocities. The corresponding HI proﬁle shows an
asymmetric absorption component, centred at a blueshifted ve-
locity of ∼ 200 km s−1. The velocity shift observed in the HI
spectrum has been interpreted as evidence for a rotating nu-
clear disk of cold gas in this galaxy (Koribalski et al. 1995).
The P-Cygni proﬁle observed towards the molecular ions stud-
ied here and HF, characterises the radial motion of the gas, which
is indicative of outﬂows from the central region. The gas asso-
ciated with the outﬂow component near 360 km s−1 is unsur-
prisingly not traced by ArH+ and shows stronger emission in
CO (particularly in its higher J-transitions) relative to the gas
near 180 km s−1. Previous studies have determined the outﬂow
component to be kinematically distinct from the surrounding
gas and is associated with the so-called western-superbubble lo-
cated north-west of the central starburst region (Sakamoto et al.
2006) while the gas at 180 km s−1 is co-located with the cen-
tral disk (Krieger et al. 2019). Such an asymmetric emission
is revealed by Hα observations whose emission is dominant on
the approaching side of the outﬂow as reported by Bolatto et al.

Towards NGC 4945, the ArH+ line displays an asymmetric ab-
sorption proﬁle between 455–715 km s−1, similar to what is ob-
served in the spectra of OH+, o-H2O+ and HF lines. As discussed
in Monje et al. (2014), van der Tak et al. (2016) and references
therein, there are at least two velocity components, however un-
like the other molecules and molecular ions, the broader compo-
nent in ArH+ is centred at 510 km s−1 and the narrower one at
605 km s−1 while for the other species the broader component is
the redshifted absorption feature.

Article number, page 4 of 16

In the p-H2O+, o-H2O+, OH+3, and HF spectra, the two ab-
sorption components are observed to be almost symmetric about
the galaxy’s systemic velocity at 585 km s−1 (Chou et al. 2007).
This may indicate that the observed absorption arises from non-
circular motions associated with the galaxy’s bar. A similar ab-
sorption dip is seen in the emission line proﬁles of lines from
higher density gas tracers like HCN, HCO+, CN (Henkel et al.
1990), H2CO (Gardner & Whiteoak 1974) and also from CO
(Whiteoak et al. 1990) near 640 km s−1. It likely traces fore-
ground molecular gas that is moving towards the nucleus.

The HI absorption spectrum against the nuclear continuum
of the source, also displays a similar proﬁle with two absorption
components with dips at ∼540 and ∼620 km s−1. The observed
shift in the centres of both the ArH+ absorption components in
comparison to that of the other molecules, suggests that ArH+
does not trace the same layers of infalling molecular gas as the
other molecules and molecular ions but rather traces mostly or
exclusively atomic gas layers, as expected.

3.1.3. PKS 1830−211
As discussed in Sect. 1, the J = 1 − 0 transition of ArH+ was ﬁrst
detected in extragalactic environments by Müller et al. (2015)
towards the intermediate redshift (z = 0.8858) lensing galaxy lo-
cated in front of the blazar, PKS 1830−211. These authors study
absorption spectra extracted from two separate lines-of-sight to-
wards two magniﬁed images located on the south-west (SW) and
north-east (NE) sides of its nucleus. Owing to diﬀerences in the
nature of the continuum between PKS 1830−211’s absorber and
the sources studied here, a direct comparison of the spectral line
proﬁles with those discussed in our study is not straightforward.
While the background continuum for NGC 253 and NGC 4945
arise from the galaxies themselves, that for the sight lines stud-

result of image band contamination from the CH3OH Jk = 94 − 83 E2
line near 959.8 GHz (Xu & Lovas 1997).

A. Jacob et al.: ArH+ and H2O+ absorption towards luminous nearby galaxies

ied towards foreground lensing galaxy in front of PKS 1830−211
arises from the distant quasar. Therefore, unlike the case for the
nearby galaxies the spatial resolution for the latter is set by the
small size of the background continuum emission (which is a
few parsec in the plane of the z = 0.8858 galaxy) but nonethe-
less we brieﬂy describe the properties of the ArH+ spectra ob-
served towards both sight lines studied by Müller et al. (2015).
The spectrum along the SW magniﬁed image comprises of a sin-
gle component with a line width of ∼ 57 km s−1 and a weaker
but broader blueshifted component, a feature that is also seen in
the 607 GHz and 634 GHz p-H2O+ spectra. However, the spec-
tral line proﬁle of ArH+ towards the NE image shows multiple
narrow absorption features spanning 200 km s−1 which is com-
parable to the spread over which absorption from other diﬀuse
gas tracers is seen in this direction, namely CH+, HF, OH+ and
H2O+ (Muller et al. 2016, 2017).

3.2. Column densities

The line proﬁles can be expressed in terms of the optical depth,
τ, using the radiative transfer equation, which for the particular
case of absorption spectroscopy is given by Tb = Tce−τ, where
Tb and Tc are the line, and the background continuum brightness
temperatures, respectively. For NGC 253, we compute optical
depths for the absorption proﬁle obtained after subtracting the
emission component. The emission component is modelled by
ﬁtting a Gaussian proﬁle centred at the systemic velocity of the
source. We ﬁtted the optical depth proﬁle on heliocentric veloc-
ity scales, that is to say τ versus. υhelio, using the Wiener ﬁlter
ﬁtting technique as described in Jacob et al. (2019). This ﬁtting
procedure ﬁrst ﬁts the spectrum using the Wiener ﬁlter kernel
by minimising the mean square error between the model (Tce−τ)
and observations. For species like OH+ and o-H2O+, whose rota-
tional transitions further undergo hyperﬁne structure (HFS) split-
ting, this algorithm additionally deconvolves the HFS from the
observed spectrum using the relative spectroscopic weights of
the diﬀerent HFS components. When ﬁtting lines that do not
exhibit HFS, the procedure simply assumes that there is only
a single HFS component whose frequency corresponds to that of
the ﬁne-structure transition itself. Other than the observed spec-
trum and the spectroscopic parameters of the line to be ﬁt, the
only other input parameter required by the Wiener ﬁlter tech-
nique is the spectral noise, which is assumed to be independent
of the observed signal. However, the Wiener ﬁlter faces singular-
ities in portions of the spectrum in which the observed line pro-
ﬁles saturate or the line-to-continuum ratio tends to zero. This is
the case for the OH+ spectrum towards NGC 253, which shows
saturated absorption at blueshifted velocities between 185 and
235 km s−1 (see Fig. 1). Therefore, as discussed in Sect. 2 we
instead model the 1033 GHz transition of OH+. Prior to per-
forming HFS deconvolution we remove contributions from the
13CH2CHCN contamination using the WEEDS package in the
GILDAS software.

The resulting optical depth proﬁles (τdecon versus. υhelio) are
used to derive column densities as follows, assuming that the
foreground absorption covers the background continuum source
entirely:

For a given species, all the spectroscopic terms in Eq. 1 namely,
the upper level energy, Eu, the upper level degeneracy, gu, and
the Einstein A coeﬃcient, AE, all remain constant, except for

the partition function, Q, which itself is a function of the rota-
tion temperature, Trot. Under conditions of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE), Trot is equal to the excitation temperature,
Tex. The excitation of the molecules is straightforward as most
of the particles are expected to occupy the ground state level,
owing to the large Einstein A coeﬃcients of all the lines in-
volved, resulting in high critical densities of the order of a few
107 cm−3 (see Table 2 for the Einstein A coeﬃcients). Therefore,
assuming a complete ground state occupation, we can approxi-
mate the excitation temperature to be less than the energy of the
upper level above the ground and equal to the radiation temper-
ature of the cosmic microwave background (TCMB = 2.73 K).
Similar assumptions for the excitation temperatures have been
made by van der Tak et al. (2016) in their analysis. Since,
TCMB < Tex < Eu/kB, the column densities derived for the dif-
ferent species studied here strictly represent only lower limits.
Unlike those of other species, the CO column densities are de-
termined from the integrated intensities of their respective emis-
sion line proﬁles, for an excitation temperature of 20 K, as was
assumed by Houghton et al. (1997) and Curran et al. (2001). Fur-
thermore, the derived column densities are corrected to a ﬁrst
order for beam dilution eﬀects, using the beam ﬁlling factor,
bﬀ, following bﬀ = (cid:104)(cid:16)

where, θs, and θb represent

the molecular source size and the beam size, respectively. The
column density proﬁles hence derived per velocity channel are

tegrating between 55 and 295 km s−1 for NGC 253, and 445 and
725 km s−1 for NGC 4945, are summarised in Table 3. Using the
column densities we determine from our spectra of the 607 GHz
p-H2O+ line, we predict, assuming conditions of LTE at 2.73 K,
integrated intensities of 1.3 and 2.9 K km s−1 for the 604 GHz
transition of p-H2O+, values that are lower than our 3σ upper
limits of 2.1 and 5.2 K km s−1 towards NGC 253 and NGC 4945,
respectively.

3.3. Cosmic-ray ionisation rates

Cosmic-rays represent the dominant source of heating and ion-
isation in the inner parts of molecular clouds that are not pene-
trated by UV photons, making them an important driver for ion-
molecular reactions, including those responsible for the forma-
tion of ArH+ (Roach & Kuntz 1970):

CR

−−→ Ar+ +e− H2−−→ ArH+ +H

(∆E = 1.436 eV) .

Hence, as a key ingredient in the ensuing chemistry, the abun-
dance of ArH+ is sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionisation rate,
ζp(H), and to the molecular fraction, fH2 , of the gas probed. The
cosmic-ray ionisation rates in both NGC 253 and NGC 4945
have previously been determined by analysing the steady-state
chemistry of oxygen-bearing ions like OH+ and H2O+ by van
der Tak et al. (2016). Following the steady-state analysis pre-
sented by these authors and Indriolo et al. (2015), we derive
revised cosmic-ray ionisation rates by including contributions
from p-H2O+. The value of NH used in our calculations is given
by N(HI) + 2×N(H2), where N(H2) is obtained by using N(HF)
as a surrogate for molecular hydrogen, where the abundance of
HF in dense gas is assumed to be 5×10−10 (Emprechtinger et al.
2012). From the column density proﬁles presented in Fig. 2, it is
clear that the total hydrogen content along the studied sight lines
are dominated by dense molecular gas with pockets or bubbles
of diﬀuse clouds as suggested by van der Tak et al. (2016). In-
cluding contributions from p-H2O+ we derive mean cosmic-ray

display their HFS deconvolved spectra. The vertical dashed black lines mark the systemic velocity of NGC 253 and NGC 4945 at 240 km s−1 and
563 km s−1, respectively. The 971 GHz OH+ line proﬁle towards NGC 253 is saturated at blueshifted velocities while the 1033 GHz OH+ spectrum
is potentially contaminated by the 13CH2CHCN (2110,11–209,12) line at 1032.783 GHz (ﬁt shown by the dark blue curve). Also marked here in blue
is contamination from the C2H5CN (379,29–376,32) line at 1033.868 GHz. The 971 GHz OH+ spectrum towards NGC 4945 is contaminated by the
CH3OH Jk = 94,6 − 8,53 E line near 959.900 GHz originating from the image sideband (marked in blue).

and NGC 4945, respectively, values that are not far from those
derived by van der Tak et al. (2016). The derived cosmic-ray
ionisation rates represent only lower limits because of uncertain-
ties in the derived column densities, particularly in that of the
HI and OH+ absorption proﬁles. In addition other assumptions
made in this calculation, such as the values of the gas density
(nH = 35 cm−3), the electron fraction (xe = 1.5 × 10−4) and the
OH+ formation eﬃciency parameter ((cid:15) = 7%) are poorly con-
strained in these sources. The general impact of the uncertain-
ties associated with the assumptions made in such an analysis,

on the derived cosmic-ray ionisation rates of Galactic sources
is discussed in more detail in Schilke et al. (2010) and Indriolo
et al. (2015).

3.4. Gas properties

The cosmic-ray ionisation rates discussed in the previous sec-
tion, ζp(H), describe only the total number of primary ionisations
per hydrogen atom, per second. In contrast, the total cosmic-ray
ionisation rate, ζt, includes contributions from both primary ion-

isation by cosmic-rays as well as ionisation by secondary elec-
trons (resulting from the former). As discussed by Neufeld &
Wolﬁre (2017), the exact relation between the two rates is de-
pendent on the molecular fraction and fractional ionisation, but
for the typical conditions of diﬀuse clouds the two are roughly
related as ζp(H) = ζt/1.5. Therefore not only do cosmic-rays
play an important role in heating the gas, they also increase the
electron abundance.

In the following sections we evaluate the impact of cosmic-
ray ionisation and heating through the physical properties traced
by ArH+. We estimate the molecular fraction characteristic of
the gas traced by ArH+ and explore the impact of collisional
excitation by electrons on the observed ArH+ abundance.

3.4.1. Molecular fraction
Under the assumption that the cloud volumes containing ArH+
are exposed to the same cosmic-ray ionisation ﬂux as those
traced by both OH+ and H2O+, we can derive the molecular frac-
tion, fH2 , of the gas probed by ArH+, using the ArH+ abundances
(with respect to HI) derived from observations as a constraint.
We ﬁrst present the relation between ζp(H), X(ArH+) and fH2 by
analysing the steady-state ion-molecular chemistry of ArH+ as
discussed in Schilke et al. (2014). ArH+ is destroyed primarily
via proton transfer reactions with H2 or atomic oxygen, and pho-
todissociation:
ArH+ + H2 → Ar + H+
3 ;
ArH+ + O → Ar + OH+ ;
ArH+ + hν → Ar+ + H ;

k5 = 8 × 10−10 cm3s−1
k6 = 8 × 10−10 cm3s−1
k7 = 1.0 × 10−11χUV fA s−1 .

The photodissociation rate of ArH+ was estimated by Alekseyev
et al. (2007) to be ∼ 1.0 × 10−11 fA s−1 for an unshielded cloud
model that is uniformly surrounded by the standard Draine UV
interstellar radiation ﬁeld. The attenuation factor, fA, is given by
an exponential integral and is a function of visual extinction, Av.
For a cloud model with Av = 0.3, Schilke et al. (2014) derived
values for fA between 0.30 and 0.56 that increase as you move
outwards from the centre of the cloud. For our analysis, we use
0.43 for fA, which lies mid-way through the computed range of
values.

We further assume an atomic oxygen abundance (relative to
H nuclei) of 3.9 × 10−4 (Cartledge et al. 2004) and an argon
abundance close to this element’s solar abundance of 3.2 × 10−6
(Lodders 2008). Observations by van der Tak et al. (2016) sug-
gest that the dense and diﬀuse gas phases are well mixed in the
galaxies under consideration here, a notion based on the simi-
larities between the observed proﬁles of OH+ and H2O+ lines
to those of H2O and HI lines. Therefore, akin to these authors,
who derived the cosmic-ray ionisation rates for NGC 253 and
NGC 4945 by analysing the steady-state chemistry of OH+ and
H2O+, we assume a gas density, n(H), of 35 cm−3 (Indriolo et al.
2015) for the OH+–H2O+ absorbing clouds in our analysis. Us-
ing these values, the cosmic-ray ionisation rate can be approxi-

Using Eq. 4, the molecular fractions of the gas probed by ArH+
are found to be a few times 10−3 towards both sources, values
that are comparable to what is derived along the NE line-of-sight
towards PKS 1830−211 (which amongst the two sight lines stud-
ied by Müller et al. (2015) has been shown to probe more diﬀuse
and atomic environments (Koopmans & de Bruyn 2005)) with
X(ArH+) = 2.8 × 10−9 and ζp(H) = 3 × 10−15 s−1. The molecu-
lar gas fraction hence derived, per velocity channel over velocity
intervals most relevant to the sources studied (as discussed in
Table 3) is displayed in Fig. 3. Towards both sources we ﬁnd
the ArH+ bearing clouds to host abundances between 10−11 and
10−10 and trace molecular gas fractions between 3×10−4 and a
few times 10−2. In comparison, OH+, whose abundance is almost
two orders of magnitude higher than that of ArH+, mainly traces
gas with molecular fractions of the order of a few times 10−1
whereas Muller et al. (2016) derived fH2 values for OH+-bearing
gas that varies between 0.01 and 0.07 towards both sight lines in
their study. Therefore, the diﬀerent atomic gas tracers may not
be spatially co-existent. Furthermore, the transition from atomic
to molecular gas is illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 3 through
the distribution of the molecular gas fractions traced by ArH+-
, OH+-, and CO-bearing gas volumes. The molecular fractions
in this analysis are computed using Eq. 4, Eq. 12 of Indriolo
et al. (2015) and by assuming a CO-to-H2 conversion factor
of 2×1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 as recommended by Bolatto et al.
(2013b), albeit with a factor of 2 uncertainty. By combining pre-
vious estimates of the cosmic-ray ionisation rates derived for
Arp 220, of ζp(H)>10−13 s−1 (González-Alfonso et al. 2013; van
der Tak et al. 2016), with our upper limit for the ArH+ abun-
dance of 2.5×10−11 (determined by integrating the 3σ detection
limit quoted in Sect. 2 over a line width of 743 km s−1 (Mirabel
1982) and N(H2) = 1 × 1024 cm−2 (Downes & Eckart 2007)), we
are unable to derive reasonable values for the molecular fraction
traced by ArH+.

3.4.2. Excitation by electrons
In this section we explore the eﬀects of collisional excitation
of ArH+ by electrons. We expect ArH+ to reside in cloud lay-
ers with electron fractions, xe of ≥ 10−5–10−4, making them
competitive collision partners to atomic hydrogen in such cloud
environments. Moreover, the destruction of ArH+ via dissocia-
tive recombination reactions with electrons have, alongside pho-
todisocciation pathways, been shown to have small to negligible

impacts on the ArH+ abundances in astrophysical environments
(Alekseyev et al. 2007; Mitchell et al. 2005; Abdoulanziz et al.
2018), making electron-impact excitation eﬀects of signiﬁcant
importance for ArH+. In order to explore this and to evaluate the
validity of our assumptions for the electron density and excita-
tion temperature, we performed non-LTE radiative transfer cal-
culations using the statistical equilibrium radiative transfer code
RADEX (van der Tak et al. 2007). The models were run for a
uniform sphere geometry (with the oﬄine version of RADEX,
which allows a choice of input geometries) under the large veloc-
ity gradient (LVG) approximation. Based on the escape probabil-
ity formalism, the code computes level populations, line inten-
sities, excitation temperatures, and optical depths as a function
of the physical conditions (kinetic temperature and density) and
radiative transfer parameters (column density and line width)
speciﬁed as inputs. The models were run using rate coeﬃcients
recently computed by Hamilton et al. (2016) for collisions be-
tween ArH+ and electrons as well as those between ArH+ and
atomic hydrogen computed by Dagdigian (2018).

By constraining the models using the ArH+ column densities
as determined in Sect. 3.2, we model the excitation temperature
of the observed 617 GHz ArH+ line as a function of the electron
density and gas temperature, Tkin. The models are run across a
100×100 grid, with xe values between 10−6, and 10−1 and gas
temperatures between 10 and 3000 K. Furthermore, the total gas
density, nH, approximated by the sum of the electron and atomic
gas densities in the models, is ﬁxed to values of 35, 100 and
1000 cm−3. The modelled results are visualised in Fig. 4. Simi-
lar to Dagdigian (2018), we ﬁnd the excitation temperature for
the models with total gas densities ﬁxed at 100 and 1000 cm−3
to be greater than our assumed value of Tex at 2.73 K, across
the entire xe parameter space, with values of Tex only slightly
higher than 2.73 for xe (cid:47) 10−3, beyond which the value of the
excitation temperature increases quite rapidly. While the gen-
eral trend for those models with a total gas density of 35 cm−3
(equal to the gas densities assumed in Sect. 3.3 to compute the

cosmic-ray ionisation rates) is similar to those with higher gas
densities, that is, 100 and 1000 cm−3, the ArH+ excitation tem-
perature over the assumed electron fraction (≈ 1.5 × 10−4 see
Sect. 3.3) remains very close to a value of 2.73 K. This im-
plies electron densities of ∼ 5.3 × 10−3, consistent with the low
electron abundances expected in gas volumes bearing OH+, a
species formed in cloud environments similar to those that con-
tain ArH+. Low electron densities are prerequisites for the for-
mation of detectable amounts of OH+, whose formation pathway
via H+
3 and atomic oxygen competes with the dissociative re-
combination of H+
3 with electrons. Observationally however, the
range of electron densities is poorly constrained with a possible
upper limit set by assuming the electron densities to be consis-
tent with the photoionisation of neutral carbon.

Using the same physical conditions as used to model the
ArH+ 1 − 0 transition, we model the 2 − 1 transition of ArH+
near 1234.602 GHz. The results are displayed in Fig. 5. For all
the models the excitation temperature for the 2 − 1 line is higher,
between ∼ 8 and 18 K, while the optical depths are extremely
low, of the order of a few 10−6 for total gas densities of 35 cm−3
and only an order of magnitude higher for models with total gas
densities of 1000 cm−3. Therefore, as discussed by Dagdigian
(2018) given the low optical depths reproduced by the models,
it is highly unlikely that the 2 − 1 transition of ArH+ can be
observed in interstellar gas; so far it has only been detected (in
emission) in the extreme circumnebular environment of the Crab
(Barlow et al. 2013; Priestley et al. 2017).

The H2O+ molecular ion exists in two symmetric states, o- and
p-H2O+, that have opposing parities due to the interaction be-
tween the magnetic moment of the unpaired electron and pro-
tons. Studying the ratio of molecules in these two states which
is reﬂected by the spin temperature, can provide insight into the
formation pathway and thermodynamic properties of the gas. In

Figures 6 and 7 display the distribution of the derived column
densities per velocity intervals (corresponding to the spacing of
the velocity channel bins) for o- and p-H2O+, the OPR and the
nuclear spin temperature. The OPRs determined for NGC 253
are quite large, with a mean value of roughly 7.0±3.1, whereas,
the mean value derived towards NGC 4945 is 3.5±1.2. The de-
rived OPRs are consistent with the equilibrium value of three
within the quoted error bars and correspond to nuclear spin tem-
peratures between 15 and 24 K.

The very large values found for NGC 253 for LSR veloci-
ties > 150 km s−1 can be partly attributed to the uncertainties re-
sulting from modelling the emission component observed in the
P-Cygni proﬁles of its o- and p-H2O+ spectra. Theoretical stud-
ies carried out by Tanaka et al. (2013) on the ortho-to-para ex-
change reactions of H2O+ reveal quite low reaction rates, which
implies that the OPR of H2O+ does not signiﬁcantly deviate from
the equilibrium value of three, particularly at low temperatures,
lower than the values we ﬁnd for NGC 253. In diﬀuse regions
aﬀected by X-rays and/or cosmic-rays, the chemistry leading to
H2O+ is initiated by the charge transfer between ionised hydro-
gen and oxygen atoms to form O+, which is subsequently fol-
lowed by reactions with H2 to ﬁrst form OH+ and then H2O+. Al-
ternatively, in regions with higher molecular fractions, both OH+
as well as H2O+ can be formed via reactions between H+
3 and
oxygen atoms (Hollenbach et al. 2012, and references therein).
Lastly, H3O+ can also be formed from hydrogen abstraction re-
actions of H2O+ in denser environments. If the exchange reac-
tion is faster than other competing reactions then the observed
upper limits of the OPR, point to gas kinetic temperatures that
are greater than ∼20 K.

Since the diﬀuse and dense gas volumes along the sight lines
towards the galaxies under study here are well mixed, the OPR
of parent species such as H+
3 , H2, and H2O, from which H2O+
originates, may impact the observed OPR of H2O+ see for ex-
ample the studies on the OPR of H2 presented by Flower et al.
2006. Destruction reactions of both the ortho- and para- forms of
H+
3 via dissociative recombination have been experimentally in-
vestigated by Glosík et al. (2010), who observe a preferential re-
combination of this molecule’s para-state compared to that of its
ortho-state, which can also lead to OPRs >3. Recently, Novotný
et al. (2019) found a similar dependence on the rotational state,
for the dissociative recombination of HeH+ ions. However, a bet-
ter understanding of the OPR of H2O+ requires a detailed un-
derstanding (not only) of what fraction of the observed H2O+ is
formed along each of the diﬀerent chemical pathways towards its
formation, alongside the eﬃciency with which either H2O+ state
(ortho or para) is formed in both quiescent and turbulent and/or
shocked regions, but also the destruction of this ionic species
which occurs primarily via dissociative recombination and hy-
drogen abstraction reactions with H2. In Appendix C we brieﬂy
evaluate deviations in the observed OPR of H2O+ from the orig-
inal OPR at formation, by carrying out a steady-state analysis of
H2O+ chemistry.

Furthermore, investigating the inﬂuence of cosmic-ray ioni-
sation on the OPR of H2O+ for star-forming regions within the
Milky Way, Jacob et al. (2020) ﬁnd that the OPR of H2O+ ther-
malises to the equilibrium value of three with increasing rates
of cosmic-ray ionisation up to a value of ∼ 2 × 10−16 s−1, beyond
which there exists no credible correlation. The correlation be-
tween cosmic-ray ionisation rates and OPRs suggests that the
higher abundances of atomic hydrogen in regions exposed to
higher cosmic-ray ﬂuxes are able to eﬃciently drive the proton-
exchange reaction causing a change in the OPR. Putting the cur-
rent results into context, we ﬁnd the data points for both studied

the following paragraphs we determine the ortho-to-para ratio
(OPR) of H2O+ and derive the nuclear spin temperature.

Unlike for H2O, the lowest energy state of H2O+ corresponds
to the lowest rotational energy level of its ortho state. This is
a result of the molecule’s C2(cid:51) symmetry and 2B1 ground state
conﬁguration. The ﬁne structure levels of the o-H2O+ spin state,
with a nuclear spin, I, of 1, further undergo HFS splitting while,
p-H2O+ (with I = 0), does not. The lowest rotational energy
= 11,1 − 00,0, lies at an energy
level of the ortho spin state, NKaKc
level which is 30.1 K lower energy than that of the lowest p-
H2O+ level, 11,0 − 10,1. Under the assumption that the rotational
temperature is close to TCMB = 2.73 K, one would expect that
most of the ions occupy either one of the H2O+ ground state
levels. Similar to H2 and H2O, H2O+ is expected to exhibit an
OPR of at least 3:1 (Townes & Schawlow 1975). Typically, the
conversion between the ortho and para states of H2O+ occurs via
gas phase reactions with atomic hydrogen, as follows:
p-H2O+ + H (cid:10) o-H2O+ + H
(5)
while H2O+ energetically reacts with molecular hydrogen to
yield H3O+.
Moderately coupled via collisions, the OPR between the two
spin states of H2O+ is given by,

OPR ≡

Qortho
Qpara

exp (−∆E/Tns) ,

(6)

where Qortho and Qpara represent the partition functions of the
respective spin isomers, ∆E is the energy diﬀerence between
them, ∆E = −30.1 K and Tns is the nuclear spin temperature.
The value of ∆E is expressed as a negative quantity because, as
discussed above, the lowest ortho state has a lower energy than
the lowest para state. As discussed in Appendix A of Schilke
et al. (2010), at low temperatures, the partition functions of the
two states are governed by the degeneracy of their lowest ﬁne-
structure and HFS levels. Having the same quantum numbers
and upper level degeneracies, the ratio of the partition functions
approaches unity as the rotational temperature tends to 0 K.

near three within the uncertainties. Given the uncertainties in the
column densities derived from both the HI and the OH+ line pro-
ﬁles, which are used to compute the cosmic-ray ionisation rates,
we represent the cosmic-ray ionisation rates as lower limits. In
analogy to the Milky Way, we would expect the cosmic-ray ion-
isation rates to be higher towards the centres of these galaxies,
however in contrast, we derive values closer to the canonical val-
ues derived towards the disk of the Milky Way (Indriolo et al.
2015; Jacob et al. 2020), outside of the central molecular zone.

4. Discussion
The gas properties of the ArH+ bearing cloud volumes that we
have derived in Sect. 3.4 towards the nearby galaxies studied in
this work are comparable to those found by Schilke et al. (2014)
and Jacob et al. (2020) for clouds along the LOS towards star
forming regions in the disk of the Milky Way. Furthermore, the
cosmic-ray ionisation rates derived towards both NGC 253 and
NGC 4945 in Sect. 3.3 are comparable to the average cosmic-
ray ionisation rate derived towards the disk of the Milky Way, of
(2.3±0.3)×10−16 s−1 (Indriolo et al. 2015; Jacob et al. 2020). The
molecular gas traced by HF has an almost two orders of mag-

tion whether ArH+ is a probe of diﬀuse atomic gas with a very
small molecular fraction (see Sect. 3.4). However, as previously
discussed by van der Tak et al. (2016), who observed OH+ and
H2O+, other well-known tracers of (predominantly) atomic gas,
towards both NGC 253 and NGC 4945, the presence of gas with
low fH2 may suggest an inhomogeneous ISM with local pock-
ets of diﬀuse clouds mixed with denser material. Perhaps, the
marginally lower cosmic-ray ionisation rates that we ﬁnd for the
galaxies studied here, in comparison to the Milky Way, may be a
result of the larger volumes of dense gas present along the LOS.
We note, however, that values for the cosmic-ray ionisation rate
estimated for the nuclear regions of ULIRGs like NGC 4418 and
Mrk 231, which harbour much more extreme star bursts than
NGC 253 and NGC 4945, are almost three orders of magnitude
higher with a lower-limit of ζp(H) > 10−13 s−1 (González-Alfonso
et al. 2013, 2018), similar to values derived towards the Milky
Way’s Galactic centre region, indicative of higher levels of ener-
getic phenomena present at the centres of these galaxies in com-
parison to their disks. This is also the case towards the diﬀuse
atomic gas rich lines-of-sight studied towards PKS 1830−211,
who derived column densities for atomic gas tracers such as
ArH+ (Müller et al. 2015), p-H2O+, and OH+ (Muller et al. 2016)
that are roughly an order of magnitude greater than those that
we derived towards NGC 253 and NGC 4945 while the column
density values for molecular gas tracers such as HF are compa-
rable between both studies (see Table 2 of Muller et al. 2016).
This results in cosmic-ray ionisation rates of ∼ 2 × 10−14 s−1 and
s∼ 3 × 10−15 s−1 for the SW and NE lines-of-sight, respectively.
In addition, while we quote LOS averaged values for
the cosmic-ray ionisation rates towards both NGC 253 and
NGC 4945 using the steady-state analysis of OH+ and H2O+,
their interpretation is not trivial as the cosmic-ray ionisation rate

suggesting that most of the gas, by volume, along the LOS to-

is likely to vary spatially, across these galaxies. This variation is
best demonstrated by observations towards diﬀerent molecular
cloud sight lines within the Milky Way by Indriolo et al. (2015)
and Jacob et al. (2020) and reﬂects the proximity of the stud-
ied molecular clouds to the nearest supernova remnants, which
are likely sites for particle acceleration amongst other propaga-
tion eﬀects. Therefore we expect the cosmic-ray ionisation rates
determined from compact regions of star-formation like the cen-
tral molecular zones of the galaxies studied here, to be orders
of magnitude greater. In general with star-formation rates higher
than that of the Milky Way by almost two orders of magnitude,
one would anticipate higher cosmic-ray ionisation rates towards
both NGC 253 and NGC 4945 since the injection of cosmic-
rays is governed by star-formation and accelerated by associ-
ated shocks like supernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles.
Observationally, higher rates of cosmic-ray ionisation have been
estimated towards the centre of NGC 253 through the detection
of gamma-rays at TeV energies using ground based Cherenkov
telescopes (Acero et al. 2009). Exhibiting both starburst and
AGN activities the nuclear environment of NGC 4945 is more
complex, as a signiﬁcant portion of the injected cosmic-ray en-
ergy is used in the production of pions and γ-rays. Wojaczy´nski
& Nied´zwiecki (2017) have shown that Seyfert galaxies like
NGC 4945 have larger γ-ray luminosity’s than the calorimet-
ric limit which sets the total energy of cosmic-rays used for the
production of pions assuming that each supernova explosion in-
jects 1050 ergs of cosmic-ray energy while that of starbursts like
NGC 253 is 50 % lower.

Moreover, while ionisation by cosmic-rays plays an impor-
tant role in heating the gas in the nuclear environment of galaxies
(Bradford et al. 2003), heating by X-rays (Usero et al. 2004) and
by stellar UV radiation (in widespread photodissociation regions
(PDRs) Hollenbach & Tielens 1997), dynamical shock heating
(García-Burillo et al. 2001) to a name a few, can all be promi-
nent sources of heating in these regions and it is not possible to
discriminate between their contributions merely by an analysis
such as ours.

5. Conclusions

Well established as a tracer for purely atomic gas, outside of the
Milky Way the noble gas species ArH+ had only been detected
towards the intermediate redshift z = 0.89 gravitational lens sys-
tem PKS 1830−211. In this work we extend the notion that ArH+
is an ubiquitous tracer of diﬀuse atomic gas towards external
galaxies by presenting observations of its J = 1 − 0 transition.

We present the detection of ArH+ in absorption towards two
nearby galaxies, NGC 253 and NGC 4945 and the non-detection
towards Arp 220. In addition to ArH+ we also report the detec-
tion of the J = 3/2 − 1/2 transition of p-H2O+ at 607 GHz to-
wards the former. We compare the observed proﬁles of ArH+
and p-H2O+ lines with those of the HI 21 cm line and lines
from the well known atomic gas tracers OH+ and o-H2O+ and
the molecular gas tracer, HF. Using the cosmic-ray ionisation
rates derived by analysing the steady-state chemistry of OH+
and H2O+ and by assuming that the cloud populations bear-
ing ArH+ are exposed to the same cosmic-ray ionisation rates,
we derive the molecular fraction of the gas traced by ArH+ to-
wards both galaxies to be between10−3 and ∼ 10−2. This is con-
sistent with estimates made within the Milky Way by Schilke
et al. (2014); Neufeld & Wolﬁre (2016); Jacob et al. (2020).
From the detection of p-H2O+ we estimate the H2O+ OPR of
7.0 and 3.5 towards NGC 253 and NGC 4945, and subsequently
derive values for the nuclear-spin temperature that are greater

than 15 and 24 K, respectively. The variation in the H2O+ OPR
with cosmic-ray ionisation rates follows the trend displayed by
sight line components towards star-forming regions within the
Milky Way other than those towards the Galactic centre. This is
likely because our observations are not sensitive to spatial vari-
ations along the sight lines studied and only probe the average
properties.

In order to comment on the ubiquity and chemistry of ArH+
and its possible role in probing the energetics of extragalactic
sources, the searches for ArH+ need to be extended to a wider
source sample. Since its chemistry and properties are widely
studied, alongside that of OH+ and o-H2O+, it may be promising
to search for ArH+ towards a range of extragalactic sources host-
ing various levels of nuclear activity, which was a selection crite-
rion for the Herschel EXtraGALactic (HEXGAL) survey which
was aimed at studying the physical and chemical composition of
the ISM in galactic nuclei using HIFI spectroscopy.

A. Jacob et al.: ArH+ and H2O+ absorption towards luminous nearby galaxies

Appendix A: HI analysis

cont

In this appendix we discuss the HI 21 cm line analysis. The HI
absorption (Ton) and emission spectra (Toﬀ), along with derived
quantities such as the optical depth, spin temperature and col-
umn density are presented in Figs. A.1 and A.2 for NGC 253
and NGC 4945, respectively. The solid black curve in the top
panel of these ﬁgures, represents the continuum normalised on-
source absorption proﬁles (T on,obs/T sou,obs
) smoothed to the reso-
lution of the emission line data. The oﬀ-source spectrum is taken
from a position next to the source of interest (well outside of the
beam width). Similar to the Milky Way disk, the HI data towards
these galaxies are subject to strong spatial ﬂuctuations and us-
ing a single oﬀ position would be error prone. Therefore, fol-
lowing Winkel et al. (2017), a spatial ﬁltering technique using
a ring (or doughnut-shaped) kernel was applied to obtain an in-
terpolated brightness temperature, as shown in the second panel
(black curve). For comparison, in the panel displaying spin tem-
peratures (computed for regions with τ > 0.01), we also plot
the brightness temperature in blue and lastly, the column den-
sity panel also displays the uncorrected column density proﬁle,
N∗
HI. The blue and grey shaded regions indicate the 1σ (68% per-
centile) and 3σ (99.7% percentile) conﬁdence intervals, respec-
tively. A detailed description is presented in Winkel et al. (2017).
As a caveat in this analysis, we mention here that this ﬁltering
technique may not be what is best suited to describe the often
observed, ‘butterﬂy’-shaped distribution of gas in these external
galaxies and a proper treatment of the same, would require the
use of a tilted ring model. In the on-source HI absorption proﬁle
towards NGC 253, we note the appearance of an emission fea-
ture between 5 and 40 km s−1, which is merely an artefact arising
from the post-processing (cleaning) of the data or is caused by
HI emission from the disk of the galaxy.

Appendix B: Continuum level uncertainties

We now brieﬂy assess the reliability of the absolute calibration
of the continuum brightness temperatures used in our analysis
that were derived from the sub-mm spectra of the ArH+ and p-
H2O+ lines taken with the APEX telescope. In Fig. B.1, for both
NGC 253 and NGC 4945, we plot the continuum brightness
temperatures measured for all individual scans versus the time
over velocity intervals used to determine the continuum level and
baseline. The scatter across the diﬀerent scans displayed is found
to lie between 11 and 17% for the two sources with an average
value of 14%, thereby yielding a fairly stable continuum level.

Appendix C: Steady-state chemistry of H2O+
As discussed in Gerin et al. (2013), the relationship between the
initial OPR of the H2O+ ions when formed, OPR0, with that
which is observed, depends upon the relative rates of these pro-
cesses. We adapt the steady-state analysis of H2Cl+ presented
in Neufeld et al. (2015) but for H2O+, to estimate the relative
importance of the diﬀerent reactions in thermalising the OPR.
Hence, the OPR of H2O+ is given by,

Fig. A.1. From top to bottom: HI absorption and emission spectra, opti-
cal depth, spin temperature, and HI column density towards NGC 253.

OPR =

kpo = kopOPRLTE(H2O+), the above equation can be re-written
as

where kpo and kop are the rate coeﬃcients for the forward and
backward reactions in (5) and kdr and kha are the reaction rates
for the dissociative recombination and hydrogen abstraction re-
actions, respectively. Assuming a detailed balance, such that

OPR = xOPRLTE + (1 − x)OPR0 ,

eﬃcient for the proton exchange reaction (5), kop, has not been

Using values for nH, nH2 , and ne as discussed in Sects. 3.3 and
3.4 and kop = 4.15 × 10−10 cm s−3, we estimate x to be 0.74. This
implies that, for values of kop > 4.15 × 10−10 cm s−3, x → 1 and
that the OPR is close to the values at LTE. On the contrary, if
kop > 4.15 × 10−10 cm s−3 then x → 0 implying that the OPR is
close to OPR0. Given the many uncertainties involved in this cal-
culation we can only conclude that the OPR derived using Eq. 6
merely represents a limit.

which k = 4.15 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 (Honvault et al. 2011). While
the rate coeﬃcient for the dissociative recombination reaction is
