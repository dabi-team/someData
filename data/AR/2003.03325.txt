ABSTRACT

Within the coronae of stars, abundances of those elements with low ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP) often differ
from their photospheric values. The coronae of the Sun and solar-type stars mostly show enhancements of low-
FIP elements (the FIP effect) while more active stars such as M-dwarfs have coronae generally characterized
by the inverse-FIP effect (I-FIP). Here we observe patches of I-FIP effect solar plasma in AR 12673, a highly
complex βγδ active region. We argue that the umbrae of coalescing sunspots and more speciﬁcally strong
light bridges within the umbrae, are preferential locations for observing I-FIP effect plasma. Furthermore, the
magnetic complexity of the active region and major episodes of fast ﬂux emergence also lead to repetitive and
intense ﬂares. The induced evaporation of the chromospheric plasma in ﬂare ribbons crossing umbrae enables
the observation of four localized patches of I-FIP effect plasma in the corona of AR 12673. These observations
can be interpreted in the context of the ponderomotive force fractionation model which predicts that plasma with
I-FIP effect composition is created by the refraction of waves coming from below the chromosphere. We propose
that the waves generating the I-FIP effect plasma in solar active regions are generated by sub-photospheric
reconnection of coalescing ﬂux systems. Although we only glimpse signatures of I-FIP effect fractionation
produced by this interaction in patches on the Sun, on highly active M-stars it may be the dominant process.

1. INTRODUCTION

Recent spectroscopic observations of the Sun have shown
how the elemental composition of the solar atmosphere
varies in space and time. The variability of composition
appears to be intrinsically linked to the distribution and evo-
lution of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld on all scales (e.g. Brooks
et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2018). More generally, the overall
composition of a star’s corona depends on the ﬁrst ionization
potential (FIP) of the main elements comprising the corona.
In solar-type stars, low-FIP elements are observed to be over-
abundant relative to their photospheric abundances, while
high-FIP elements maintain their photospheric abundances
(the FIP effect; e.g. Laming et al. 1995; Wood & Linsky

2010; Testa et al. 2015; Laming 2015; Brooks et al. 2017).
In cooler, more active stars such as M-dwarfs, low-FIP/high-
FIP elements are under-/over-abundant in the corona com-
pared to the photosphere (the inverse FIP or I-FIP effect;
Laming 2015; Brooks 2018). Wood & Linsky (2010) and
Wood et al. (2018) ﬁrst established an almost linear rela-
tionship between stellar composition and spectral type F to
M in the X-ray spectra of moderately active stars (X-ray lu-
minosity <1029 ergs s−1).
In addition, a dependence has
been found of coronal composition on stellar magnetic activ-
ity, with high-activity stars having I-FIP-effect coronae and
low-activity stars like our Sun having FIP effect dominated
coronae (Audard et al. 2003; Garc´ıa-Alvarez et al. 2009;
Testa et al. 2015).

BAKER ET AL.

One plasma fractionation model that is able to account for
the FIP and I-FIP effects observed in stars is the pondero-
motive force model (Laming 2015). The model invokes the
ponderomotive force exerted by Alfv´en waves giving rise to
ion–neutral separation in the chromosphere of the Sun and
other stars. Fractionation takes place in the chromosphere
where the temperature and density gradients are high and
temperatures are such that low-FIP elements are mainly ion-
ized and high-FIP elements remain neutral. The direction
of the ponderomotive force determines whether low-FIP el-
ements become enhanced or depleted in the corona. Down-
ward propagating Alfv´en waves generated by magnetic re-
connection in the corona are mostly reﬂected back into the
corona at the high density gradient in the chromosphere,
creating an upward-directed ponderomotive force acting on
the ions (Laming 2017). When the plasma is observed in
the corona, the low-FIP elements are over-abundant relative
to the photosphere. An inverse FIP effect is created when
upward-traveling waves undergoing reﬂection or refraction
back downwards produce a downward-directed ponderomo-
tive force acting on the ions in the chromosphere. Such
upward-propagating waves can be generated, for instance, by
magneto-acoustic waves originating from below the chromo-
sphere that are mode converted to fast mode waves at the
plasma β = 1 boundary. As a consequence of the down-
ward ponderomotive force, the plasma is then depleted of
low-FIP elements (Laming 2015; Brooks 2018). In this ar-
ticle, we present observations that suggest a more speciﬁc
origin for the waves producing the I-FIP effect, namely a sub-
photospheric one.

Though the Sun’s corona is dominated by the FIP effect
(Laming et al. 1995; Brooks et al. 2015, 2017), recent spec-
tral scans taken by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
(Culhane et al. 2007) on board the Hinode spacecraft (Ko-
sugi et al. 2007) have shown highly localized regions of I-FIP
effect plasma near sunspots in ﬂare spectra (Doschek et al.
2015; Doschek & Warren 2016, 2017). Doschek & War-
ren (2017) proposed that the FIP effect ‘shuts down’ near
sunspots where p-modes are suppressed, leading to areas of
photospheric, weak I-FIP, or I-FIP effect plasma, while the
rest of the active region has coronal composition.

At low spatial resolution, solar coronal abundances in
ﬂares have been previously analyzed and shown to be very
different from quiescent conditions (e.g. Sylwester et al.
1984; Feldman & Widing 1990; Warren 2014), having a ten-
dency to be close to photospheric values. Composition stud-
ies of stellar ﬂares provide strong indications of a similar
effect, i.e.
that the elemental abundances tend to approach
photospheric values both on FIP-effect and I-FIP-effect dom-
inated stars (e.g. Nordon & Behar 2008; Laming & Hwang
2009). Recently, Katsuda et al. (2020) reported the I-FIP ef-
fect in four large X-class ﬂares (X17.0, X5.4, X6.2 from AR

10808 and X9.0 from AR 10930) derived from Earth albedo
X-ray spectra from the imaging spectrometer on board the
Suzaku astronomical satellite.

Baker et al. (2019) analyzed in detail Hinode/EIS obser-
vations of plasma composition during the decay phase of an
M-class ﬂare in AR 11429. Patches of I-FIP effect plasma
appeared in a highly sheared emerging ﬂux region above
sunspot umbrae 10 min after the ﬂare peak and disappeared
40 min later. The authors proposed that sub-chromospheric
reconnection of highly sheared coalescing strands of the
same polarity magnetic ﬁeld played a key role in the creation
of I-FIP effect plasma within the highly complex magnetic
ﬁeld of the active region. During episodes of strong emer-
gence, ﬂux approached and interacted with pre-existing mag-
netic ﬁeld, forcing the coalescence of the smaller ﬂux frag-
ments into growing, coherent umbrae surrounded by com-
mon penumbrae in two of the sunspots. The convergence
of magnetic ﬁeld in the location of the coalescing umbrae
is highly suggestive of the presence of sub-chromospheric
magnetic reconnection. Reconnection that occurs below the
region of plasma fractionation in the chromosphere generates
a fast-mode wave ﬂux in the direction required by the pon-
deromotive force fractionation model to produce I-FIP effect
plasma (Laming 2015). The fractionated plasma is then evap-
orated into the corona by ﬂaring and observed by Hinode/EIS
when ﬂare ribbons cross the coalescing umbra.

In this paper, magnetic ﬁeld and continuum observations of
the most unusual and complex magnetic ﬁeld of AR 12673
are combined with Hinode/EIS scans to investigate the pres-
ence of I-FIP effect plasma. We conﬁrm the ﬁndings of Baker
et al. (2019) and provide evidence in support of the genera-
tion of I-FIP effect plasma by sub-photospheric reconnection
in coalescing sunspot umbrae with strong light bridges (LBs).
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the
magnetic ﬁeld evolution, Section 3 details the Hinode/EIS
observations, Section 4 provides our analysis and interpreta-
tion of the observations of anomalous plasma composition in
the context of the ponderomotive force fractionation model,
and in Section 5 we present our conclusions.

2. MAGNETIC FIELD EVOLUTION OF AR 12673

AR 12673 was visible on the Sun from 2017 August 28
to September 10.
Its magnetic ﬁeld evolved into one of
the most complex structures observed during solar cycle
24 (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2020). The sunspot group’s
Mount Wilson magnetic classiﬁcation was βγδ, the total un-
signed ﬂux exceeded 5×1022 Mx and the projected whole
spot area peaked on September 6 at ∼2,100 MSH (mil-
lionths of a solar hemisphere; from the Debrecen Photohe-
liographic Database: http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/DPD/
2017/index.html). Overall activity included 4 X-, 27 M-, and
55 C-class ﬂares, making AR 12673 the most ﬂare produc-

tive of solar cycle 24. Several signiﬁcant coronal mass ejec-
tions (CMEs) were launched during its disk passage (Red-
mon et al. 2018). Furthermore, this ‘monster’ active region
exhibited highly unusual characteristics and extreme behav-
ior including the fastest ﬂux emergence ever recorded (Sun
& Norton 2017), the strongest transverse (Wang et al. 2018)
and coronal magnetic ﬁelds (Anﬁnogentov et al. 2019).

Figure 1 shows selected co-temporal radial magnetic ﬁeld
and continuum images from the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Scherrer et al. 2012). The
data are from the Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch
(SHARP; Bobra et al. 2014) pipeline. The enclosed movie of
the ﬁgure is entitled Fig1 movie.mp4. A full account of the
structure and evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld leading to the
ﬁrst direct evidence of sub-photospheric reconnection is pro-
vided in van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2020). The main features
are summarized here using the same notation.

AR 12673 was formed from the emergence and subsequent
interaction of three ﬂux systems labeled in Figure 1: a long-
lived, stable positive spot P0; an arcade system formed of
n1–p1 and n2–p2; and the main ﬂux system composed of N3–
P3 and N4–P4 (the arcade/main ﬂux systems are labeled in
gray/black in Figure 1). Early on September 2, bipole n1–p1
emerged to the south-east of pre-existing P0. Bipole n2–p2
followed one day later and emerged to the north-east of P0.
Very quickly the two bipoles formed a coherent arcade sys-
tem with a C-shaped magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL),
as the fast moving emerging ﬂux wrapped around the well-
anchored P0. On September 3, the main ﬁeld comprising
bipoles N3–P3 and N4–P4 emerged in a dominantly N–S di-
rection underneath the E–W oriented arcade system repre-
sented by n1–p1 and n2–p2. At the location where the main
system emerged into the arcade system lying above it, an M-
shaped ﬂux tube was present. It was formed by a concave-up
U-loop (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2000) between N4 and P3
and two lobes of concave-down Ω loops, P3–N3 in the north
and P4–N4 in the south (Fan et al. 2003; Toriumi et al. 2014).
Key aspects of the active region’s magnetic ﬁeld evolution
occurred in the time period of September 4–6 leading up to
the times of the X2.2 and X9.3 ﬂares. First, during the on-
going emergence of the constituent bipoles of the three ﬂux
systems, strands of same polarity magnetic ﬁeld coalesced
to form coherent sunspot umbrae in the active region core to
the east of P0 (at p2 and N4) and at its periphery to the north
and south-west at n2 and p1, respectively. These were also
the locations where signiﬁcant LBs formed between merg-
ing umbral ﬂux strands. Coalescence was driven by espe-
cially strong and fast episodes of ﬂux emergence on Septem-
ber 4–6 (see Fig1 movie.mp4). Second, early on September
6, the north-western part of N4 detached and began moving
northward. This detached polarity penetrated the ‘wall’ of

opposite polarity ﬁeld along P3–p2 (Figure 1, middle pan-
els), then it broke in two pieces. One piece, N4u, mostly ro-
tated counter-clockwise around P3 indicating that it was still
bound by the U-loop anchorage (Figure 1, bottom panels).
The other piece, N4f , moved rapidly northward, then west-
ward in the direction of N3. On September 7, the main ﬂux
system –at least temporarily– ceased its emergence into the
E–W arcade ﬂux system thereby removing the major driver
of the unusual and extreme magnetic ﬁeld evolution in AR
12673.

3. OBSERVATIONS OF AR 12673

In this analysis, we focus on the three day period encom-
passing the largest ﬂare of solar cycle 24, the X9.3 ﬂare
that peaked at ∼11:53 UT on September 6. Figure 2 shows
the GOES 1–8 ˚A soft X-ray light curve from 00:00 UT on
September 5 – 00:00 UT on September 8 when Hinode/EIS
was observing AR 12673 employing a multitude of stud-
ies and scanning modes. However, not all studies contain
suitable emission lines from high- and low-FIP elements for
measuring plasma composition. The basic details of the stud-
ies used here are provided in Table 1. The times of the
Hinode/EIS composition observations are indicated by the
dashed red lines plotted with the GOES soft X-ray curve in
Figure 2.

The studies listed in Table 1 contain the high-FIP Ar XIV
194.40 ˚A (FIP = 15.76 eV) and low-FIP Ca XIV 193.87 ˚A
(FIP = 6.11 eV) emission lines. The two ions have sim-
ilar contribution functions therefore their intensity ratio is
suitable to determine (I)FIP levels within the AR (Feldman
et al. 2009).
In line with Doschek et al. (2015), Doschek
& Warren (2016, 2017) and Baker et al. (2019), we use the
following log10 abundance values relative to log10H = 12:

BAKER ET AL.

Figure 1. SDO/HMI SHARP radial magnetic ﬁeld, Br, and 6173 ˚A continuum images (Bobra et al. 2014) during the evolution in AR 12673.
Middle and lower panels correspond to the times of when Hinode/EIS observed I-FIP effect plasma (Figures 3, 4, 5). Major components of
the ﬂux systems are labeled in each image: arcade ﬁeld n1–p1 and n2–p2 (labels in gray); main ﬁeld N3–P3 and N4–P4 (labels in black), and
pre-existing, well anchored spot P0. The U-loop is formed in between N4–P3 as well as N4u–P3 (bottom panels). Near the end of the emergence
phase, polarities N4u and N4f detached from the north part of N4. Note that n and N notations are used for negative, p and P notations for
positive polarity umbrae. Red/blue corresponds to positive/negative Br in the magnetograms. See the included movie Fig1 movie.mp4 of this
ﬁgure. For ease of comparison between ﬁgures, black arrows are used to show the distances from the center of the major polarities. At 16:46
UT on September 6, the vertical arrow is ∼50(cid:48)(cid:48) in length between the centers of P0 and P4. The horizontal arrow is ∼30(cid:48)(cid:48) in length from the
centers of P0 and N4. The center of P0 is X = 590(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = -242(cid:48)(cid:48). This convention is repeated for all ﬁgures with maps.

Ca = 6.93 (Feldman 1992) and 6.33 (Caffau et al. 2011) for
the corona and photosphere, respectively; Ar = 6.5 (Lodders
2008) is the same for the corona and the photosphere. Calcu-
lations of the contribution functions using these abundances
were performed with the software included in the CHIANTI
Atomic Database, version 8.0 (Dere et al. 1997; Del Zanna
et al. 2015). Based on the intensity ratio of the contribution
functions of high-FIP Ar XIV and low-FIP Ca XIV, values >1
indicate the I-FIP effect, = 1 is photospheric plasma, and <1
is FIP effect or typical solar coronal plasma. The estimated
uncertainty of the ratio is ±0.28 assuming an intensity error
of 20%. Considering the uncertainties, in the text and ﬁgures
we refer to ratio values ≥ 1.3 as I-FIP effect plasma.

Though Ar XIV and Ca XIV have similar contribution func-
tions, it is not immediately apparent what, if any, temperature
effects ﬂaring might have on the uncertainties of the I-FIP
effect measurements as large ﬂares can have much higher
densities (N) at high temperatures (T) (e.g. Watanabe et al.
2010; Graham et al. 2011; Sim˜oes et al. 2015) compared to
non-ﬂaring active regions (Doschek et al. 2007; Tripathi et al.
2008). The Ar XIV/Ca XIV ratio can vary by a factor ∼4 in
the log10 T = 6.6–6.9 range (with T in K, see e.g. Doschek &
Warren 2017; Baker et al. 2019).

We derived the mean temperatures and densities for all
strong I-FIP effect regions corresponding to Table 2 where
the appropriate diagnostic line pairs were included in the EIS

Spectroscopic data were reduced using standard routines
available in the Hinode/EIS section of Solar Software (SSW;
Freeland & Handy 1998). Three Gaussians were ﬁt to the Ar
XIV 194.40 ˚A emission line to remove two unidentiﬁed lines
in its blue wing. The Ca XIV 193.87 ˚A line was also ﬁt with
three Gaussians to separate the line from nearby Fe X 193.72
˚A, Ni XVI 194.05 ˚A, and 194.10 ˚A lines (Brown et al. 2008;
Doschek et al. 2015; Baker et al. 2019).

All Hinode/EIS maps and SDO/HMI line-of-sight magne-
tograms were co-registered in a two step process. First, the
aia prep.pro routine located in the SDO branch of SSW was
used to align HMI and AIA data. The routine takes into ac-
count differences in the plate scales and roll angles between
the two instruments. Second, either the Fe XII 195.12 ˚A or
186.88 ˚A EIS intensity maps were aligned by eye with the co-
temporal AIA 193 ˚A passband images. The EIS Fe XII emis-
sion lines and AIA 193 ˚A broadband imager sample plasma
at similar temperatures so that the same coronal structures are
identiﬁable in each image making alignment straightforward
between Hinode/EIS and SDO. To help the reader to track
different features in the ﬁgures, we have added arrows to in-
dicate the central positions of major polarities and the dis-
tances between them. A vertical arrow shows the positions
and distance of the P0–P4 centers (∼50(cid:48)(cid:48)) and a horizontal
arrow shows the same for P0–N4 (∼30(cid:48)(cid:48)).

Figure 2, lower panel, shows a sample Ar XIV/Ca XIV
ratio map with/without SDO/HMI contours of ±500 G
(white/magenta for positive/negative polarities) at 19:56 UT
on September 6. Four regions of interest based on the mag-
netic ﬂux systems described in Section 2 are labeled as fol-
lows: n2 in the spatially extended magnetic ﬁeld to the north;
N4u which detached northward from N4; p2 located on the
east side of the large positive sunspot P0; and p1 along the
extended positive polarity to the south. Similar ratio maps
with the corresponding Ar XIV 194.40 ˚A and Ca XIV 193.87
˚A intensity maps are displayed in Figures 3 and 4.

Hinode/EIS observed AR 12673 at 02:35 UT on Septem-
ber 6 during a relatively quiet period (Figure 3, top panel).
The core of the active region is predominantly composed of
typical coronal plasma. FIP effect levels range from ∼0.3 to
0.5 using the high-FIP Ar XIV/low-FIP Ca XIV ratio, which
is equivalent to the conventional solar low-FIP/high-FIP ra-
tio of 2.0–3.3. Localized regions at p2 and N4 show weak
indications of I-FIP effect plasma. Both patches of I-FIP ef-
fect plasma evolve to photospheric composition within ∼25
min (at 02:59 UT) and the patch associated with N4 returns
to coronal plasma within ∼50 min (at 03:23 UT) when Hin-
ode/EIS composition observations ended.

EIS composition observations resumed at 16:13 UT dur-
ing the extended decay phase of the X9.3 ﬂare, just after the
peak of an M2.5 ﬂare at 15:56 UT (see the GOES soft X-ray
light curve in Figure 2). At this time plasma of photospheric

in this study. The thicker lines represent a series of nearby obser-
vations. Bottom panels: Hinode/EIS Ar XIV/Ca XIV ratio map at

ties (right). The color bar scale shows the FIP effect as blue/green,
photospheric composition as orange, I-FIP effect as yellow. (P0 is

studies (e.g. Ar XIV 187.9/194.4 ˚A and Fe XIII 203.8/202.0
˚A). For raster times from 19:29–20:14 UT, we were only
able to obtain temperature measurements. Log10 N were in
the range 10.2–11.1 (with N in cm−3) and the log10 T were
6.6–6.7. These compare to values in FIP effect regions of
log10 N = 8.9–9.9 and log10 T = 6.2–6.4, respectively.

Higher density in the I-FIP effect regions lowers the the-
oretical ratio, so high observed I-FIP effect values of Ar
XIV/Ca XIV become more extreme in the abundance differ-
ences that they imply. Furthermore, the temperatures fall
within the range that is considered to be plausible for the for-
mation temperatures of Ar XIV and Ca XIV (Doschek & War-
ren 2017). It is very difﬁcult to disentangle the density and
temperature effects caused by the ﬂaring but the increase in
density combined with the fact that the temperature does not
exceed log10 T = 6.7 suggests that the density and tempera-
ture effects are unlikely to substantially affect the estimated
uncertainty of ±0.28. The results may be very different for
measurements made during the peak phase of large ﬂares but
this is not the case here as the rasters were timed during the
decay phases of the ﬂares on September 6.

composition was present in the southern part of n2 and at
N4u. Thirty minutes later, the plasma at N4u had evolved to
I-FIP effect plasma while weak I-FIP patches appeared at p2
(Figure 3, bottom panel). I-FIP effect plasma was observed
at these locations until the Hinode/EIS observing sequence
ended at 17:07 UT

The data shown in Figure 4 were obtained when Hin-
ode/EIS was operating in its autonomous observing mode. A
ﬂare response study was triggered by an M1.4 ﬂare at 19:29

the active region (see the FOVs shown in white in Figure 4).
All regions deﬁned in Figure 2 have patches of I-FIP effect

plasma from 19:29–20:14 UT except for p2 where the plasma

gion had returned to FIP effect composition in the Ar XIV/Ca
XIV ratio maps. Approximately 13.5 hr later, a C5.4 ﬂare
triggered a series of Hinode/EIS observations from 21:35 to
22:19 UT. Figure 5, bottom panel, shows a representative

sample at 21:35 UT. I-FIP effect plasma was no longer visi-
ble within the active region. Only remnant patches of photo-
spheric composition remained in the vicinity of N4u. Coro-
nal composition was observed everywhere else including at
p2 where patches of I-FIP effect plasma were present on the
previous day.

4. DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION

In this study, we have analyzed the evolution of plasma
composition in AR 12673 on 2017 September 5–7. Hin-
ode/EIS detected highly localized patches of I-FIP effect
plasma embedded within the characteristic FIP effect plasma
of the active region core (e.g. Del Zanna & Mason 2014;
Baker et al. 2015). I-FIP effect plasma was present ∼8 hours
before the X9.3 class ﬂare at 12:02 UT on September 6 and
also during the long decay phase extending to ∼20:00 UT.
The plasma composition of AR 12673 had returned to FIP
effect when Hinode/EIS observed it ∼13 hr later.

4.1. I-FIP Effect Plasma Observed at the Locations of

Sub-photospheric Reconnection

A notable feature of the evolution of the highly complex
magnetic ﬁeld of AR 12673 is the coalescence of same polar-
ity magnetic ﬁeld strands in a number of locations through-
out the active region. From the time of its emergence on
September 3, the positive polarity strands of the E–W ori-

ented arcade system merged together east of P0 until a coher-
ent umbra was evident at p2 in the continuum images early on
September 4 (see Fig1 movie.mp4). A train of positive um-
brae approaching from the north continued to coalesce with
the already coherent p2 umbra for the next ∼2 days before
the structure began to fragment on September 7.

The main N–S oriented ﬂux system emerged after the ar-
cade system later on September 3 when the opposite polar-
ities rapidly separated, N4 moving in a northward direction
and P4 progressing to the south-southwest. Right from the
start, there was a continuous inﬂux of new strands of neg-
ative polarity coalescing at N4 for the same time period as
with p2. Co-temporal emergence of P4 with N4 forced posi-
tive ﬁeld in the vicinity of p1 to amalgamate into the sunspot
in the southwest of the active region. The process of sunspot
coalescence driven by strong ﬂux emergence of same polar-
ity ﬁeld was repeated in n2 when N4u broke away from the
main N4 umbra. It pushed into the negative ﬁeld at n2 and
then rotated around P3.

I-FIP effect plasma was observed within the coalescing
umbrae at p2, N4, P4–p1, and N4u–n2. The patches can be
located more precisely within the umbrae where strong LBs
formed during the merging and coalescence of the sunspots.
So-called strong LBs appear between magnetic ﬁeld strands
of the same polarity during the early stages of the AR’s de-
velopment rather than during sunspot decay which is more

commonly associated with faint LBs (e.g. Felipe et al. 2016,
and references therein). Red arrows indicate the locations of
strong LBs within N4, p2, and p1 in the HMI continuum im-
ages from September 6 in Figure 6 (top panels). Contours of
I-FIP effect plasma are overplotted on zoomed images of the
LBs. The I-FIP effect plasma is precisely located at the LBs
within the coalescing umbrae of the respective regions.

Once major ﬂux emergence paused in the core of the AR
late on September 6, the LBs were either no longer visible
(N4) or they became part of the fragmentation process in the
sunspot during its decay phase (p2). On the southern edge
of the AR, the LB at p1 remained prominent for at least an-
other day as ﬂux emergence was still ongoing, driving P4
into p1 and forcing coalescence of the sunspot. The evolu-
tion of the LBs can be viewed in the HMI continuum images
of Fig1 movie.mp4.

Coalescing sunspot umbrae are preferential sites for sub-
chromospheric reconnection to take place especially dur-
ing the early development of highly complex active re-
gions. Major ﬂux emergence episodes push ﬂux tubes of
the same polarity against each others. From their different
sub-photospheric evolution, these ﬂux tubes are expected to
typically have a ﬁnite angle between them. Then, component
magnetic reconnection is expected to be present between the
coalescing ﬂux tubes (see Figure 7a).

locations of strong light bridges at N4, p1, and p2 regions deﬁned in Figure 2. Insets are zoomed images of the light bridges overplotted with
red contours of I-FIP effect = 1.3. The I-FIP effect plasma is precisely at the locations of the strong light bridges. Bottom panel: SDO/AIA
1600 ˚A images overplotted with blue I-FIP effect plasma contours of ≥ 1.3. Contours have been derotated from the times of the Hinode/EIS
rasters. (P0 is located at X = 610(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = -241(cid:48)(cid:48) at 19:38 UT and at X = 608(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = -241(cid:48)(cid:48) at 19:25 UT).

There is a plausible alternative scenario of internal recon-
nection within an individual ﬂux tube in the case of N4u. The
ﬂux tube may have been deformed as it rotated around P3,
creating magnetic shear, beginning at around the time of the
X2.2 ﬂare and continuing during the early decay phase of the
X9.3 ﬂare. This evolution is shown from early on September
6 in the movie linked to Figure 1. Signiﬁcant deformation of
the N4u ﬂux tube may generate internal current sheets where
sub-photospheric reconnection could take place. Either sce-
nario or a combination of them is plausible at N4u, however
internal reconnection does not appear to be a likely cause of
reconnection at p2, N4, and p1 which showed little evidence
of magnetic shear in their formation.

4.2. Revealing I-FIP effect plasma with Flare Energy Input

Successive episodes of major ﬂux emergence and its in-
teraction with a pre-existing, well-anchored sunspot resulted
in the formation of the highly complex magnetic structure
of AR 12673. Continual interaction gave rise to signiﬁcant
ﬂare productivity (e.g. Yang et al. 2017; Verma 2018; Ro-
mano et al. 2018, 2019; Toriumi & Wang 2019), indicating
the occurrence of magnetic reconnection in the solar corona.

Figure 7. (a) Two ﬂux systems with a non-zero component of anti-parallel ﬁeld between them are pushed together and reconnect below the
photosphere. In the case of the general scenario shown in (b), reconnection generates sound waves that mode convert into magneto-acoustic
waves at the β = 1 layer. These waves are refracted/reﬂected in the chromosphere, leading to a downward oriented ponderomotive force which
depletes the low-FIP ions from the chromosphere. The general scenario is consistent with Baker et al. (2019). In the speciﬁc light bridge
scenario (c) proposed in Section 4.4, sub-photospheric reconnection launches incompressible (shear) Alfv´en waves along the magnetic ﬁeld
lines at the edges of the light bridge. No mode conversion takes place but the rest of the scenario in (b) remains.

ﬂare loops, the coronal counterpart of the ribbons. Major
ﬂaring occurred in the vicinity of the U-loop conﬁguration
introduced in Section 2 (Yang et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2018).

During the rise phase of the X9.3 ﬂare, two ribbons be-
gan to develop on either side of the C-shaped PIL within
the active region core involving mainly P3–p2–P4 and N4u–
N4. The ribbons then extended into N4f and N3 soon after
the eruption of the magnetic ﬂux rope/CME coinciding with
the ﬂare peak at 12:02 UT (Mitra et al. 2018). The overly-
ing post-ﬂare loop arcade rooted in the two ﬂare ribbons re-
mained visible in the SDO/AIA coronal passbands through-
out the extended decay phase of the ﬂare until the early hours
of September 7.

Ribbons associated with the M2.5 and M1.4 ﬂares (peak-
ing at 15:56 and 19:30 UT, respectively) also appeared along
the PIL, tracing parts of the X9.3 ribbon ‘tracks’ at p2–P3 and
N3–N4u–N4f . The ribbons are clearly evident in SDO/AIA
1600 ˚A images at 15:55 and 19:25 UT in the bottom panel of
Figure 6. Blue contours of I-FIP effect plasma (ratio ≥ 1.3)
are overplotted on the images and have been derotated from
the times of the Hinode/EIS raster times given in the ﬁgure.
Contours located at p2 and N4u lie directly along the ribbons
of both ﬂares as does the n2 contour associated with the M2.5
ﬂare. There are no obvious ﬂare ribbons extending to P4 in
the AIA 1600 ˚A image at 15:55 UT, however, the I-FIP effect
contours correspond to the footpoints of the post-ﬂare arcade
at 16:43 UT (not shown).

4.3. Comparison of ARs 11429 and 12673

The Hinode/EIS observations of plasma composition in
AR 12673 are globally comparable to those of AR 11429
(Baker et al. 2019). Distinct patches of I-FIP effect plasma
were located at coalescing sunspot umbrae during ﬂaring ac-
tivity. The patches were observed when and where ﬂare rib-
bons crossed the umbrae.

In the case of AR 11429, two compact patches of I-FIP ef-
fect plasma appeared and disappeared within one hour during
the decay phase of a single, isolated M-class ﬂare. Though
the scenarios are very similar, the scales are different for AR
12673 in that four patches were present for time scales of
hours not minutes over the merging umbrae of four instead of
two sunspots. Furthermore, soft X-ray emission was signiﬁ-
cantly elevated for hours leading up to the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare
and continued at very high levels for over 16 hrs after the
X9.3 ﬂare peak (Figure 2) compared to less than two hours
during the M-class ﬂare in AR 11429. The two M-class ﬂares
that occurred during the extended decay phase of the larger
of the two X ﬂares added additional heating sources. This
does not necessarily mean that an increase in ﬂaring activity
directly produces more I-FIP effect plasma since more ﬂar-
ing would only allow us to observe more I-FIP effect plasma
regions via chromospheric evaporation if they are present.

However, more globally, an increase of magnetic complex-
ity can induce more reconnection below the fractionation re-
gion (in the chromosphere) and in the corona implying both
the creation of more I-FIP effect plasma and more ﬂares.
Then, we expect a generic correlation between the complex-

PLASMA COMPOSITION IN AR12673

11

ity and emergence rate of the magnetic ﬁeld, the amount of
I-FIP effect plasma, and the ﬂaring activity level.

Another common feature to both active regions is the oc-
currence of patches of I-FIP effect plasma at LBs within the
coalescing umbrae. After noticing the precise location of the
patches at the strong LBs during the formation stages of the
same polarity sunspot umbrae, we re-examined the contin-
uum movie of AR 11429 and indeed, patches of I-FIP effect
plasma were also found under similar circumstances at strong
LBs.

4.4. Why is I-FIP effect plasma observed at light bridges?

Baker et al. (2019) proposed that transient patches of
I-FIP effect plasma observed in AR 11429 were created
by increased fast mode wave ﬂux that was generated by
sub-chromospheric/-photospheric reconnection of coalesc-
ing umbrae (Figure 7b). Fast mode waves coming from be-
low the fractionation region of the chromosphere and un-
dergoing a total internal reﬂection mean that the pondero-
motive force is directed downward so that low-FIP elements
are depleted from the chromospheric plasma (Laming 2015).
Sunspot umbrae are preferential locations to observe I-FIP
effect plasma. They are where the magnetic ﬁeld is strongest
therefore the plasma β = 1 layer is lower in the photosphere
(Avrett et al. 2015) so that the fast mode wave ﬂux from
below is enhanced. The vertical ﬁeld of the umbrae is also
where the downward-directed ponderomotive acceleration is
likely to be the strongest as the plasma upﬂow must be along
the magnetic ﬁeld, making the ﬁeld-aligned ponderomotive
force most relevant.

nection was likely to be an ongoing process.
signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence was the main driver of sunspot
coalescence. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of Baker
et al. (2019). The classical scenario is forced magnetic re-
connection between two independent ﬂux tubes where there
is some angle between the same polarity strands that are
pushed together by convective motions (Figure 7a), leading
to the formation of MHD waves in the process. AR 12673
is an extreme case of the forced reconnection scenario due to
the amount and complexity of the emerging magnetic ﬁeld.
There is essentially a rescaling due to energy input. Finally,
I-FIP effect plasma was not observed within the AR after ma-
jor ﬂux emergence of the main ﬂux system ceased.

Previously, we have argued in Baker et al. (2019) that fast
mode waves cause the I-FIP effect, mainly because of the
ease, relative to Alfv´en waves, of achieving the required de-
gree of reﬂection to produce I-FIP rather than FIP effect frac-
tionation. Fast mode waves (sound waves) produced below
the β = 1 layer by reconnection mode convert where β = 1
to continue as fast modes (now magneto-acoustic waves) in

the β < 1 chromosphere, where they refract/reﬂect exerting
a downward ponderomotive force on the ions (Figure 7b).
The mode conversion is essential, and increases with increas-
ing angle between the magnetic ﬁeld direction and the wave
vector. While this might produce some selectivity in where
I-FIP can be produced, upward propagating sound waves are
less likely to mode convert and produce I-FIP in the vertical
magnetic ﬁeld, and it is still less obvious why I-FIP should
be restricted to the LBs, as observed in AR 11429 and AR
12673.

We propose in the following a slightly more reﬁned sce-
nario, which consists of two interlinked parts: the ﬁrst ingre-
dient is the geometry of the sub-photospheric reconnection
that creates the train of waves responsible for the I-FIP effect
fractionation; the second one is the nature of waves such that
they remain associated with a speciﬁc bundle of ﬁeld lines,
emerging at a very speciﬁc location, and only there.

LBs are very particular areas within an active region where
pockets of relatively unmagnetized plasma are trapped within
two merging ﬂux systems of the same strong polarity, form-
ing a sunspot. The sub-photospheric forces that merge the
two ﬂux systems may eventually be able to squeeze out the
unmagnetized plasma and lead to a structure that looks like
a single-polarity spot in white light images and line of sight
magnetograms. Therefore, LBs are the photospheric trace
of the merging plane between two ﬂux systems that, gen-
erally, extend down in the convection zone, at least deeper
than the vertical extension of the unmagnetized plasma vol-
ume that supports the LB. At the sub-photospheric location
where the two ﬂux systems are pushed together by the high-
β plasma it is conceivable that component ﬁeld reconnection
between nearly parallel ﬂux bundles of the same sign occurs
(Figure 7a). This is the main assumption of this scenario. If
this is true, then the numerical simulations by Kigure et al.
(2010) provide crucial information, namely that in a high-
β plasma environment, the reconnection between nearly-
parallel ﬂux systems would mostly generate incompressible
(shear) Alfv´en waves. Applying this result in our hypo-
thetical scenario (Figure 7c), the sub-photospheric reconnec-
tion process would then launch incompressible Alfv´en waves
along the ﬁeld lines of the ﬂanks of the reconnecting ﬂux sys-
tems that surrounds the LB. Since Alfv´en waves must prop-
agate along ﬁeld lines, as they travel upward, these waves
would then eventually emerge at the sides of the LB, irre-
spective of how deep the LB extends below the photosphere.
Furthermore, the magnetic ﬁeld right above a LB was ob-
served recently by Felipe et al. (2016) using high resolution
measurements from the GREGOR telescope (Schmidt et al.
2012). The authors conclude that the ﬁeld at the side of the
LB stretches up along its two sides and converges above the
LB, forming a cusp-shape across it, with the mainly horizon-
tal LB ﬁeld being conﬁned below the cusp. Following the

12

BAKER ET AL.

cusp lines, the shear Alfv´en waves of sub-photospheric origin
would reach the chromosphere, where they could provide the
energy, and the correct direction of travel, for the pondero-
motive I-FIP effect fractionation in a very localized volume,
namely right above the LB. Hence, if the above scenario is
correct, the observations of I-FIP effect fractionated plasma
should be located between the merging sunspot’s fragments,
i.e. at the LB, which is indeed what is observed.

The above scenario is highly speculative. Getting sufﬁ-
cient reﬂection of Alfv´en waves to cause I-FIP rather than
FIP effect fractionation probably requires more wave inter-
action physics in the chromospheric model, as Alfv´en waves
likely reﬂect off sound waves, shocks or other density inho-
mogeneities. This can be modeled analytically, but will re-
quire both numerical testing and observational conﬁrmation.
The numerical testing is needed to conﬁrm that upwards trav-
eling shear Alfv´en waves from below the photosphere can re-
ﬂect efﬁciently and drive the I-FIP effect fractionation. The
observational veriﬁcation entails a multi-line spectropolari-
metric study of LBs to verify the presence of such waves
at the sides of the LB. On the other hand, such a scenario
assumes sub-photospheric reconnection between the merg-
ing ﬂux systems that drives the formation of an observed LB
and therefore determines the observed localization of I-FIP
effect plasma on the basis of the properties of reconnection
between nearly-parallel ﬂux systems. As mentioned above,
such a localization at LBs is more difﬁcult to explain with
compressible waves which can travel across ﬁeld lines.

5. CONCLUSIONS

I-FIP effect plasma has been detected in only eight ac-
tive regions (Doschek et al. 2015; Doschek & Warren 2016,
2017),but it is not yet clear how widespread the phenomenon
is. Observational constraints are likely to play a role in limit-
ing the number of I-FIP effect plasma detections. It requires
the right composition lines in the employed study, the correct
target selection, and pointing at the speciﬁc ﬂaring locations
within the target active region during the time of ﬂaring ac-
tivity.

A signiﬁcant fraction of the I-FIP effect plasma observa-
tions were obtained while Hinode/EIS was operating in its
ﬂaretrigger mode. This is an observing strategy to catch
ﬂares, and the response study is initiated only at or near
the ﬂare peak time. Itremains to be seen whether a differ-
ent observing strategy, dedicated to observing I-FIP effect
events, would be more successful at capturing the evolution
of plasma composition before and during the ﬂare rise phase.
Notwithstanding these limitations, observations of AR
11429 and AR 12673 show that they share common char-
acteristics in their magnetic conﬁguration which distinguish
them as potential candidates for the detection of I-FIP effect
plasma. Both active regions were large (> 500 MSH) and

magnetically complex (βγδ) with ongoing major ﬂux emer-
gence of sheared/twisted ﬁeld which violently interacted
with pre-existing ﬁeld.

Our interpretation of the Hinode/EIS observations of I-FIP
effect plasma in AR 12673 is consistent with the pondero-
motive fractionation model. Ongoing sub-chromospheric or
sub-photospheric reconnection at multiple sunspot umbrae is
likely to increase the wave ﬂux from below the chromosphere
thereby providing favorable circumstances for the accumula-
tion of I-FIP effect plasma in more locations and on longer
time scales than for AR 11429.

Flaring and evaporation of chromospheric material are es-
sential parts of this scenario. Along ﬂare ribbons at the foot-
points of newly formed loops, which rarely traverse coa-
lescing umbrae, the expected chromospheric composition is
close to photospheric. The Sun-as-a-star (Warren 2014) and
stellar (Audard et al. 2003; Garc´ıa-Alvarez et al. 2009; Testa
et al. 2015) observations during ﬂares are consistent with this
since they indicate that the overall elemental composition is
getting close to photospheric value. The presence of bright I-
FIP patches shifts the overall composition of FIP-effect dom-
inated coronae even more towards photospheric or indeed to
I-FIP effect values (e.g. Katsuda et al. 2020).

Do we need ‘monster’ active regions to produce I-FIP ef-
fect coronal composition? So far the evidence is pointing that
way, but the picture is clouded by observational constraints.
What is likely to be a requirement is a strong wave ﬂux
from below the chromospheric fractionation region. There
is a considerable fraction, ∼30%, of the total released en-
ergy of Alfv´en waves generated in high plasma–β recon-
nection events (Kigure et al. 2010), so that I-FIP effect is
expected to occur more often than what has been observed
so far if sub-photospheric reconnection occurs frequently be-
tween the multiple thin ﬂux tubes present in emerging ARs.
Based on the observations of AR 12673, we propose a sce-
nario where shear Alfv´en waves originating below the pho-
tosphere and traveling upward can localize the I-FIP effect
plasma at strong light bridges at coalescing umbrae.

Active region complexity is highly correlated with activity
(see e.g. Toriumi & Wang 2019, and references therein) so
there is a temptation to associate the presence of localized
regions of I-FIP effect plasma in so-called monster active re-
gions on the Sun with more active M-dwarf stars contain-
ing very large/strong starspots (e.g. Berdyugina 2005; Rein-
ers 2012) and whose coronae are dominated by I-FIP effect
plasma. It is expected to be a matter of the scale of waves
generated by magnetic reconnection in sub-fractionation lay-
ers of stars. X-ray ﬂux is a function of overall heating in a
star’s atmosphere (e.g. Wood et al. 2018) which in turn gov-
erns the elements that are ionized on that star. The presence
of strong and highly complex magnetic ﬁeld provides addi-
tional heating and MHD waves that determine the direction

and strength of the ponderomotive force and therefore the de-
gree and direction of plasma fractionation, whether I-FIP or
FIP effect, on stars of spectral types F–M.

The ﬁlling factor of spot umbrae on the photosphere of a
star is likely to be a signiﬁcant factor in determining the ex-
tent to which I-FIP effect plasma ﬁlls the star’s corona. On
the Sun, strong magnetic ﬁelds are found in the small local-
ized areas of sunspots covering a small fraction of the surface
(< 0.5%, Hathaway 2015) hence we may observe very small
patches of I-FIP effect plasma. On the more active M-dwarfs,
starspots can cover up to 2 orders of magnitude more of a
star’s photosphere (e.g. Jackson & Jeffries 2013; Tregloan-
Reed & Unda-Sanzana 2019), which may explain why their
coronae are dominated by I-FIP effect plasma.

The recognition that stellar coronal composition has a de-
pendence on magnetic activity (Audard et al. 2003; Garc´ıa-
Alvarez et al. 2009; Testa et al. 2015) is in line with our re-
sults of resolved I-FIP generation on the Sun in a FIP-effect
dominated low-activity star. The I-FIP patches are closely
related to strong magnetic ﬁeld concentrations and made ob-
servable in the corona by ﬂaring.

We thank the referee for their helpful suggestions to im-
prove the clarity of the manuscript. The authors are very
grateful to Konkoly Observatory, Budapest, Hungary, for
hosting two workshops on Elemental Composition in Solar
and Stellar Atmospheres (IFIPWS-1, 13-15 Feb, 2017 and
IFIPWS-2, 27 Feb-1 Mar, 2018) and acknowledge the ﬁnan-

cial support from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences un-
der grant NKSZ 2018 2. The workshops have fostered col-
laboration by exploiting synergies in solar and stellar mag-
netic activity studies and exchanging experience and knowl-
edge in both research ﬁelds. Hinode is a Japanese mis-
sion developed and launched by ISAS/JAXA, collaborating
with NAOJ as a domestic partner, and NASA and STFC
(UK) as international partners. Scientiﬁc operation of Hin-
ode is performed by the Hinode science team organized at
ISAS/JAXA. This team mainly consists of scientists from in-
stitutes in the partner countries. Support for the post-launch
operation is provided by JAXA and NAOJ (Japan), STFC
(UK), NASA, ESA, and NSC (Norway). SDO data were ob-
tained courtesy of NASA/SDO and the AIA and HMI science
teams. D.B. is funded under STFC consolidated grant num-
ber ST/S000240/1 and L.v.D.G. is partially funded under the
same grant. The work of D.H.B. was performed under con-
tract to the Naval Research Laboratory and was funded by
the NASA Hinode program. GV acknowledges the support
from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and in-
novation programme under grant agreement No 824135 and
of the STFC grant number ST/T000317/1 J.M.L. was sup-
ported by the NASA HGI (80HQTR19T0029), NASA HSR
(NNH16AC391), and LARS (NNH17AE601) programs, the
Chandra GO program and by Basic Research Funds of the
Chief of Naval Research. DML is grateful to the Science
Technology and Facilities Council for the award of an Ernest
