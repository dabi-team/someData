ABSTRACT
High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve the origin of the faint unidenti-
3.5 keV emission line reported in several low-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as
ﬁed E
galaxies and clusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomi ﬁrst-light observation of the
Perseus cluster. The emission line expected for Perseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large clus-
ter sample under the dark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data. However, the
previously reported 3.5 keV ﬂux from Perseus was anomalously high compared to the sample-based prediction.
We ﬁnd no unidentiﬁed line at the reported high ﬂux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncer-
tainties for this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% signiﬁcance for a broad dark-matter line and
at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do not ﬁnd anomalously high ﬂuxes of the nearby faint K line or
the Ar satellite line that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. We do ﬁnd a hint of a
broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions of S xvi (E
3.44 keV rest-frame) — a possible signature
of charge exchange in the molecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentiﬁed line. While
its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely to explain the MOS signal. A conﬁrmation of
this interesting feature has to wait for a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.

1. INTRODUCTION
The nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the fundamental
unsolved problems in physics and astronomy. Direct particle
searches in laboratories as well as searches for electromag-
netic signal from celestial objects have been conducted with
no unambiguous detection so far. X-ray observations of DM
concentrations, such as galaxies and clusters, provide a probe
for a particular DM candidate, a sterile neutrino, which is pre-
dicted to decay and emit an X-ray line (Dodelson & Widrow
1994; Abazajian et al. 2001). Early searches that provided
upper limits on line ﬂux (and thus the particle decay rate) as
a function of line energy (which gives the particle mass) are

reviewed, e.g., in Abazajian et al. (2012) and Boyarsky et al.
(2012).

A possible detection was reported by Bulbul et al. (2014,

hereafter B14), who found an unidentiﬁed line at E
≈
3.55 keV in the stacked spectrum of a large sample of galaxy
clusters using XMM-Newton EPIC MOS and pn. Within their
sample was the Perseus cluster (its central region), whose sig-
nal was particularly strong. B14 also reported a detection
from Perseus with Chandra at the same energy. Boyarsky
et al. (2014) reported an XMM detection in the outer region
of Perseus. Urban et al. (2015) and Franse et al. (2016, here-
after F16) detected the line in several regions of Perseus with
Suzaku; however, Tamura et al. (2015) did not detect it in
the same Suzaku data. The 3.5 keV line was also reported
from other objects, such as the Galactic Center (Boyarsky et

al. 2015) and M31 (Boyarsky et al. 2014). Other sensitive
searches did not detect a signiﬁcant line signal (e.g., from the
Milky Way halo, Sekiya et al. 2016; Draco dwarf, Ruchayskiy
et al. 2016; stacked Suzaku clusters, Bulbul et al. 2016). Some
of the nondetections were inconsistent with other detections
under the decaying DM hypothesis (in which the line ﬂux
must be proportional to the projected DM mass), most sig-
niﬁcantly, in a sample of galaxies (Anderson et al. 2015). We
also note here that the signal from Perseus reported by XMM,
Chandra and Suzaku was higher than expected given the sig-
nal from the rest of the cluster sample (B14). Astrophysical
explanations of the reported line, in addition to those consid-
ered by B14, have also been proposed; a critical review can be
found in F16. An extensive review of the recent observations
is given, e.g., by Iakubovskyi (2015).

As recognized in all previous studies, the above line de-
tections were near the capability for CCD detectors — for a
1
100 eV resolution, the line reported from clusters with a
∼
∼
eV equivalent width (EW) is a 1% bump above the continuum,
easily aﬀected by errors in modeling the nearby atomic lines
and in instrument calibration. A conﬁrmation with a much
better spectral resolution was considered essential. Hitomi,
launched in February 2016 and lost in March (Takahashi et al.
2014, 2016) after having returned a groundbreaking spectrum
of the Perseus cluster (Hitomi Collaboration 2016, hereafter
H16), oﬀered us such a possibility. We present results from
this dataset below.

We use h = 0.7, Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7 cosmology. The
cluster heliocentric redshift (average for member galaxies) is
0.0179 (Strubble & Rood 1999) and the redshift in the CMB
frame is 0.01737, which gives dL = 75.4 Mpc and a scale of
21.2 kpc per 1′. We use the 68% (1σ) conﬁdence level for
errors unless stated otherwise.

2. DATA
The Perseus cluster was the ﬁrst-light target for Hitomi, ob-
served early in the instrument activation phase with the Soft
X-ray Spectrometer (SXS; Kelley et al. 2016). SXS is an array
of 35 calorimeter pixels with a 4.9 eV FWHM energy resolu-
3′ ﬁeld of view (FOV) at the focus
tion (H16), covering a 3′ ×
of a Soft X-Ray Telescope (SXT; Soong et al. 2016). To max-
imize statistics, here we coadd the 230 ks Perseus dataset used
in H16 and a later 45 ks pointing for a total exposure of 275
ks. The former dataset is a combination of observations 2 on
1′
2016 February 24-25 and 3 on March 3-5, both pointed
away from the cluster center, while the latter (observation 4
on March 6-7) is on-center. The earliest observation 1 was
pointed away from the core and is not included.

∼

For these observations, SXS was still protected from possi-
ble contaminants by the closed gate valve (GV) window. It in-
cludes a Be ﬁlter that absorbs soft X-ray photons. At E = 3.5
keV, the GV window transmission is 1/4 of that in the normal
operation mode, yielding the number of photons equivalent to
about 70 ks of normal observations.

3. ANALYSIS
To fully utilize the SXS high energy resolution, accurate
calibration of gain (the conversion from the amplitude of the
detected signal to photon energy) for each of its 35 pixels
is essential. Unfortunately, the individual pixel gains were
changing during the early part of the mission, and a contem-
poraneous gain calibration for the SXS array as planned for
later operations was not available. The procedure that we de-
vised to calibrate the Perseus data is described in H16. For

some of the analysis in H16, an additional scale factor was ap-
plied to force the bright 6.7 keV Fe Heα line from the cluster
to appear at the same energy in every pixel. This additional
step removes the true gas velocity gradient across the clus-
ter along with any residual gain errors. Since DM does not
move with the gas, this would also broaden a DM emission
line. However, as reported in H16, the gas velocity diﬀerence
1, much less than
across the Perseus core is around 150 km s−
the expected width of the DM line that we will try to detect.
We use the energy-aligned data in this work, but have con-
ﬁrmed that our results are essentially the same with or without
this ﬁnal energy-scale alignment. We do not report the best-ﬁt
redshift below because we simply recover the value used for
energy alignment.

We used the Be layer thickness (270

10 µm) calibrated
using Crab and G21.5–0.9 spectra taken after the Perseus ob-
servation.2 This diﬀers from the instrument response used in
H16 and results in a more reliable slope of the spectrum in the
3–7 keV band.

±

The detector energy response (RMF) was generated using
the observed energy resolution of the individual pixels. Its un-
certainty is discussed in H16 and is negligible for this work.
We bin the spectrum by 2 eV (which is close to optimal bin-
ning, Kaastra & Bleeker 2016) and ﬁt using the C statistic
(Cash 1979). The number of counts per 2 eV bin is around
200 in this band, i.e., the statistics is nearly a Gaussian distri-
bution with σ = √N. The instrumental background is negli-
gible.

3.1. Systematic uncertainties
The SXT has a 1.2′ angular resolution (half-power diame-
3′
ter). For our analysis of the spectrum from the whole 3′ ×
FOV, we do not attempt to account for PSF scattering in and
out of the FOV, and use the instrument response for an on-axis
point source. We estimate the eﬀect of this simpliﬁcation on
the model normalization to be

±
A more insidious eﬀect may be caused by uncertainty in
modeling the SXT eﬀective area (Kurashima et al. 2016). The
SXT reﬂectivity around the Au M edges was measured on
the ground and combined with values from Henke (1993) for
other energies. The ground measurements show
1% sys-
tematic deviations from Henke, one of which is in the 3.43–
3.68 keV interval above the Au M1 edge — at our energies
of interest. Given the ﬁnite accuracy of the ground measure-
ments, we consider the possibility that the Henke values are
more accurate. To quantify the eﬀect of this uncertainty, be-
low we will derive some of the results using both the default
area curve (which uses the Hitomi mirror measured reﬂectiv-
ities) and one in which the Henke values were used above the
Au M1 edge. Similar deviations may be seen at other Au M
edges, but the next one (M2 at 3.15 keV) is well outside our
interval of interest and we will not consider it.

text). Prominent atomic lines seen in the model (identiﬁed using AtomDB) are marked, along with the interesting Ar xvii satellite line (B14) that’s too faint to be
seen in the model. Brackets show 90% conﬁdence intervals on the unidentiﬁed 3.5 keV line energy for the most-restrictive XMM MOS stacked-clusters sample

et al. 2005), which agrees with that derived in the X-ray by
Chandra (Schmidt et al. 2002) and XMM (Churazov et al.

component from the AGN in NGC 1275 (Fabian et al. 2015).
The SXS broad-band eﬀective area calibration is not yet good
enough for ﬁtting multiple continuum components reliably.
Therefore, to derive a spectral shape for the AGN component,
we extracted the AGN spectrum from the oﬀ-center Chan-
dra Perseus observations (those where the point-like AGN
is not aﬀected by pileup) and obtained a power-law photon
Eα) and an absorption

ﬁts and leave further discussion of the AGN spectrum for fu-
ture work. Its contribution to the 3–4 keV ﬂux is 15% and it
does not aﬀect our results.

statistic of 603 (χ2 = 611) for 619 d.o.f. If the power-law
component is omitted, the temperature changes to 3.70

The parameters obtained from a ﬁt in this narrow inter-
val are qualitatively similar to those from a broader 3–7 keV

band with the power-law slope ﬁxed at
kT = 3.84
0.02 keV (though with a considerably higher
abundance, 0.68

closeness of the best-ﬁt temperatures, even though they are
statistically inconsistent, suggests that the shape of the eﬀec-
tive area curve over the 3–7 keV band is reasonably correct.
Importantly for this work, the continuum model at the energy
of interest (3.5 keV) diﬀers by only 1% between the above
ﬁts. We further checked its robustness by ﬁtting a simple
power law in the interval 3.30-3.75 keV between the bright
Ar and Ca lines, excluding intervals with all the weak model
lines between, and obtained a continuum ﬂux only 0.4% dif-
ferent from our default bapec model. As a further check, we
also compared the best-ﬁt normalization of our bapec model to
that from Chandra for the same region of the cluster, exclud-
10% below Chandra’s,

and the simpliﬁed accounting for the PSF.

We start checking the consistency of the MOS-derived 3.5
keV emission line with the SXS spectrum by adding a Gaus-
sian line with this ﬂux at a range of energies to the SXS model.
We consider an astrophysical line broadened by turbulence or
a wider line expected from the DM decay. If the astrophysical
line comes from an element whose lines are seen in this range,
1. Added
thermal broadening would correspond to 100 km s−
1, this
in quadrature with turbulent broadening of 180 km s−
results in an intrinsic Gaussian σ = 2.4 eV at these energies
(in addition to the instrumental σ = 2.1 eV, or 4.9 eV FWHM,
1
modeled by the RMF). For a DM line, we try 1300 km s−
(σ = 15 eV), which is the l.o.s. velocity dispersion of the clus-
ter galaxies (Kent & Sargent 1983). An arbitrary intermediate
1 corresponds to a lower dispersion in the
case of 800 km s−
region of the cD galaxy projected onto the cluster dispersion.
The additional broadening for a putative DM line caused by
our energy alignment (
3) is negligible for such widths, and it
would not apply to the narrow line originating in the gas.

measurement of B14, that of the XMM MOS stacked-cluster
sample, and for the XMM MOS spectum of the Perseus re-
gion covered by Hitomi. For a quantitative comparison, we
extracted a MOS 1+2 spectrum from a circular region approx-
imating the SXS FOV (both oﬀset and solid angle) in observa-
tions 2 and 3 that give most of the exposure, ignoring a small
oﬀset for observation 4. We then modeled the 3.5 keV line in
that spectrum reproducing the procedure in B14. In particu-
lar, we ﬁt the MOS spectrum in the 2.4–6 keV band using a
line-free single-temperature apec model and a set of Gaussian
lines at energies of the known atomic lines (with energies al-
lowed to vary slightly), in order to model the continuum and
lines in as model-independent a way as possible given a CCD
detector. The faint atomic lines near the energy of interest
that could not be directly detected by the CCD, namely, K
xviii Heα at 3.51 keV (rest-frame) and Ar xvii Heβ satellite
at 3.62 keV, were constrained in the ﬁt using the bright lines
of S xv Heα (2.46 keV rest) and S xvi Lyα (2.62 keV), which
are good temperature diagnostics. The measured S xv and

HITOMI CONSTRAINTS ON THE 3.5 KEV LINE IN PERSEUS

Figure 2 shows the value of ∆C (which has the same inter-
pretation and normalization as ∆χ2) for the addition of a line
at the best-ﬁt MOS ﬂux, compared to the best-ﬁt SXS line
ﬂux at that energy (allowing for negative line ﬂux to avoid
distorting the probability distribution, as advised by Protassov
et al. 2002). For the broad line, we also show ∆C for a ref-
erence model with zero line ﬂux rather than the best-ﬁt SXS
ﬂux. B14’s most restrictive 90% MOS energy interval for the
stacked sample is shown, since we are assuming that this is a
DM line and it has the same energy in all objects. For narrow
and broad lines, the best-ﬁt XMM MOS ﬂux value is inconsis-
tent with the SXS spectrum; the weakest constraint is for the
broad line and the discrepancy is at least ∆C = 12. Using only
observations 2+3 (excluding the better-centered, but short ob-
servation 4) reduced ∆C for the broad line compared to the
zero-ﬂux model by about 4, commensurate with the reduction
in the number of photons. The eﬀective area uncertainty de-
scribed in
3.1 is illustrated by error bars for the broad line;
the alternative area curve reduces the model values at these
energies slightly, thereby reducing the signiﬁcance of the ex-
clusion of the XMM ﬂux to at least ∆C = 9. Its eﬀect on the
narrower lines is weaker.

§

4.2.1. The statistical question
To interpret the above ∆C (or ∆χ2) in terms of a conﬁdence
level for the line exclusion, we should note that the statisti-
cal question we are asking — what is the conﬁdence level of
excluding the previously-detected line — is diﬀerent from a
blind line search employed for detecting the line. If a spectral
line is detected in a blind search and it corresponds, e.g., to
a 3σ deviation, one has to estimate the probability of a false
detection under the hypothesis of no line, caused by a pos-
itive random ﬂuctuation. Because a +3σ deviation appear-
ing at any spectral bin would be detected as a line, such a
probability is the probability of a +3σ deviation in one bin
times the number of bins where the line could be found within
the searched interval (the “look-elsewhere” eﬀect, e.g., Gross
& Vitells 2010; this factor was applied in B14). However,
here we must estimate the probability of a null hypothesis in
which the line exists and we falsely reject it because of a ran-
3σ
dom negative deviation at the position of the line. While
deviations can appear at any spectral bin, only one of them,
that happens in the bin with the line, would result in false
rejection, while all others would be dismissed as mere ran-
dom deviations. Thus, even though we do not know where
within the XMM interval the line is, the probability of false
3σ deviation in one bin —
rejection is the probability of a
there is no look-elsewhere eﬀect in our statistical problem. A
∆C = 9 or ∆χ2 = 9 corresponds to the standard one-parameter
99.9% conﬁdence level. Because ∆C is not
1
constant across the interval in Fig. 2, we can take its minimum
for a conservative limit for rejecting a certain line ﬂux.

The above ∆C gives only the Hitomi statistical constraint
and does not take into account the fact that the XMM SXS-
FOV detection itself is only 3σ signiﬁcant (and thus cannot
be ruled out with a > 3σ signiﬁcance). To answer a narrower
question of how inconsistent the Hitomi and XMM MOS re-
sults for the same region are, we ran a simple Monte-Carlo
simulation with the line energy and ﬂux randomly drawn from
the XMM one-parameter intervals assuming Gaussian distri-
butions, and the Hitomi line ﬂux at that energy randomly
drawn using the Hitomi statistical uncertainty. For a broad

The Crab spectrum (shown binned to 32 eV, which roughly
corresponds to the expected DM line width) has 1.5 times
more counts at these energies than the Perseus spectrum, and
has suﬃcient statistics to exclude any eﬀective area artifact
around 3.5 keV of much more than 1% (the size of the error-
bars). The area systematic uncertainty (
3.1), shown in the
lower panel of Fig. 4, is also a smaller (1%) eﬀect. The ﬁne
structure of the Au M1 edge (same panel), measured with high
energy resolution during ground calibration, occurs on energy
scales smaller than the “dip”.

§

We have also checked if this dip may be caused by some
time-dependent instrumental eﬀect. For this, we divided the
full Perseus dataset into the early and late subsets — obser-
vations 2 and 3+4, respectively, separated by a week (
2).
Results from these subsets for the broadened line, analogous
to those shown by red line in Fig. 3 for the full exposure, are
shown in Fig. 5. The dip appears in the early subset but not
2σ apart at
in the late one. However, the subsets are only
3.5 keV, so the statistics are insuﬃcient to determine if this
is a systematic time-dependent change. The Crab observa-
tion (Fig. 4) was performed later than our late subset and thus
does not help in ruling out a transient instrumental artifact in
earlier data; however, we can not think of a physical expla-
nation for such eﬀect. Given the available data, we have to

conclude that the dip is most likely an unfortunate statistical
ﬂuctuation, and base our results on the whole dataset in order
to avoid statistical biases.

4.3.1. A possible excess at 3.44 keV (rest frame)

−

The only positive deviation in Fig. 3 is a broad excess above
the best-ﬁt thermal model at E = 3.38
3.39 keV (observed).
The statistical signiﬁcance of this feature is only 1.5σ and it
would not be worth mentioning, if not for the fact that it is
located at the energy of the high-n to n = 1 transitions of
S xvi. Excess ﬂux in these transitions can be interpreted as
a signature of charge exchange between heavy nuclei com-
ing in contact with neutral gas — possibly the molecular neb-
ula observed in the Perseus core. These particular transitions
were proposed as a possible explanation for the 3.5 keV line in
clusters by Gu et al. (2015). A detection of charge exchange
in the ICM would be of great astrophysical importance, but it
should be conﬁrmed with other elements (to be addressed in
future work) and eventually with a longer exposure.

5. DISCUSSION
Our analysis of the Hitomi spectrum of the Perseus cluster
core reveals no unidentiﬁed emission line around the energy
reported by B14. It is inconsistent with the presence of a line
at the ﬂux reported by B14 using XMM MOS (as rederived for
the approximate SXS FOV). Taking into account the uncer-
tainties of the XMM MOS measurement in this region, which
itself is only 3σ signiﬁcant, the inconsistency with Hitomi for
a broad line (that would be emitted by DM) is at the 99% con-
ﬁdence level, and 99.7% for a narrow line from the ICM. The
broad line exclusion level is 97% if we force the SXS line
ﬂux to be zero, assuming in eﬀect that the mild “dip” in the
residuals (
4.3) is not statistical as we concluded, but some
instrumental artifact present only in Perseus and not in other

§

HITOMI CONSTRAINTS ON THE 3.5 KEV LINE IN PERSEUS

SXS data. We note here that F16, using Suzaku data for a
similar Perseus region, reported a line ﬂux and its uncertainty
similar to that from the XMM SXS-FOV measurement, but
given the lack of consensus between diﬀerent Suzaku analy-
ses (cf. Tamura et al.), we leave a comparison with Suzaku for
a later work.

We can exclude one of the 3.5 keV line astrophysical ex-
planations proposed by B14 — namely, anomalously bright
K xviii Heα or Ar xvii Heβ satellite lines. These lines are not
signiﬁcantly detected in the SXS spectrum, their ﬂuxes are
consistent with expectations and below the MOS 3.5 keV ﬂux.
If we consider a slightly wider energy range (Fig. 3), there is
a hint of a broad excess emission feature of the right ampli-
3.44
tude (though at very low statistical signiﬁcance) at E
keV rest-frame, where charge exchange on S xvi has been
predicted (Gu et al. 2015). However, the energy of this fea-
ture is 2.6σ (100 eV) away from the best-ﬁt energy for the
MOS SXS-FOV detection, and even more inconsistent with
the MOS stacked-cluster sample, though it is consistent with
the pn detections (B14). If conﬁrmed with better statistics, it
is an interesting feature in itself.

≈

Given Hitomi’s much greater spectral resolution, it is likely
that the inconsistency with XMM that we reported here is at-
tributable to a systematic error in the XMM result. Possible
causes will be examined in a future work, using the new ac-
curate knowledge of the ﬂuxes of all the nearby atomic lines
from Hitomi, as well as Suzaku and Chandra spectra and mod-
els. One possible reason, mentioned among the Caveats in
B14, is that with a CCD resolution, a spurious
1% dip in the
eﬀective area curve is all that is needed to produce a false line-
like residual of the observed amplitude (see Fig. 7 in B14).
This is an obvious problem for detections in a single object or
in local objects, even when diﬀerent instruments with similar
low-resolution detectors are used. Such systematic eﬀects can
be minimized by stacking objects at diﬀerent redshifts. In the
cluster sample of B14, the 3.5 keV rest-frame energy spans a
1.2 keV interval of detector energies, which should smear out
any such instrument features. Thus this systematic error will
be much smaller in the stacked-sample signal.

∼

As noted in B14 and subsequent works, the reported line
in Perseus, and especially in its core, was much brighter than
expected from the signal in the larger cluster sample, scaled
by mass under the decaying-DM hypothesis. Assuming that

−

the high Perseus line ﬂux is an artifact but the stacked-sample
signal is real, we can evaluate the corresponding expected
ﬂux from the SXS FOV. To estimate the projected dark mat-
ter mass within this region, we use a total mass proﬁle from
Simionescu et al. (2011) and one from the Vikhlinin et al.
(2006) M
T scaling relation (the former was used in Ur-
ban et al. and the latter in B14), correcting them for the 14%
baryon fraction. The projected DM mass within the SXS FOV

The right vertical axis in Fig. 3 shows the sterile neutrino
decay rate that corresponds to the line ﬂux on the left axis, us-
ing the median projected DM mass estimate. The Hitomi 3σ
upper limits on Γ are, unfortunately, much higher than many
earlier constraints (see, e.g., B14). This is because of the high
X-ray brightness of the ICM in the Perseus core, the short
exposure (combined with the GV attenuation), and the small
SXS FOV.

Our results from this relatively short observation illustrate
the dramatic improvement in sensitivity for narrow features
from that of CCD detectors. However, as expected, the im-
provement for a putative cluster DM line, which would have a
width of 30–35 eV (FWHM), is less signiﬁcant. The short
Hitomi observation excluded the anomalously bright signal
reported from the Perseus core. However, to test the much
weaker stacked-sample detection (provided it withstands the
reevaluation of the systematic uncertainties after the Hitomi
result) will require the photon statistics comparable to that of
the CCD stacking studies, or looking at objects where the line
is easier to detect. Among clusters, such objects would be
non-cool-core systems, in which the line EW should be an or-
der of magnitude higher for the same line ﬂux because of the
lower ICM background. A DM line would be narrower, giving
a calorimeter a greater leverage, in systems with low velocity
dispersion, such as dwarf spheroidals and the Milky Way. Of
course, distinguishing a DM line from an astrophysical one
would require resolving the line, which only a calorimeter can
do.
