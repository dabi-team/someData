Abstract
Venus’s past climate evolution is uncertain. General circulation model simulations permit a habitable climate as
late as ∼0.7 Ga, and there is suggestive—albeit inconclusive—evidence for previous liquid water from surface
geomorphology and mineralogy. However, it is unclear whether a habitable past can be reconciled with Venus’s
inferred atmospheric evolution. In particular, the lack of leftover atmospheric oxygen argues against recent water
loss. Here, we apply a fully coupled model of Venus’s atmospheric–interior–climate evolution from post-accretion
magma ocean to present. The model self-consistently tracks C-, H-, and O-bearing volatiles and surface climate
through the entirety of Venus’s history. Atmospheric escape, mantle convection, melt production, outgassing, deep
water cycling, and carbon cycling are explicitly coupled to climate and redox evolution. Plate tectonic and stagnant
lid histories are considered. Using this coupled model, we conclude that both a habitable Venusian past and one
where Venus never possessed liquid surface water can be reconciled with known constraints. Speciﬁcally, either
scenario can reproduce bulk atmospheric composition, inferred surface heat ﬂow, and observed 40Ar and 4He.
Moreover, the model suggests that Venus could have been habitable with a ∼100 m global ocean as late as 1 Ga,
without violating any known constraints. In fact,
if diffusion-limited water loss is throttled by a cool,
CO2-dominated upper atmosphere, then a habitable past is tentatively favored by our model. This escape throttling
makes it difﬁcult to simultaneously recover negligible water vapor and ∼90 bar CO2 in the modern atmosphere
without temporarily sequestering carbon in the interior via silicate weathering to enhance H escape.

1. Introduction
Despite decades of study, Venus’s past remains enigmatic.
Models of planetary formation suggest that early Venus ought
to have been endowed with a water inventory comparable to
that of Earth (Raymond et al. 2006, 2007), and elevated D/H
ratios in the modern atmosphere are indicative of past water
loss (Donahue et al. 1982). But whether Venus’s surface was
ever habitable is a subject of ongoing debate. Understanding
past conditions on Venus may enable more robust interpreta-
tions of terrestrial exoplanet observations (Kane et al. 2019;
Lustig-Yaeger et al. 2019b). Moreover, purported detections of
phosphine in Venus’s atmosphere and its possible biological
origin (Bains et al. 2021; Greaves et al. 2021), while
controversial (Encrenaz et al. 2020; Snellen et al. 2020; Akins
et al. 2021; Villanueva et al. 2021), similarly highlight the need
to better understand Venusian history, as does recent reanalysis
of Pioneer Mass Spectrometer data that are suggestive of
previously unknown chemical disequilibria in Venus’s middle
atmosphere (Mogul et al. 2021).

Models of Venusian climate evolution are conﬂicted on
whether Venus experienced transient surface habitability early in

its history. Kasting (1988) used a radiative-convective climate
model to show that the insolation received by early Venus lies
close to the runaway greenhouse threshold. Consequently,
whether early Venus possessed liquid surface water or has always
been in a runaway greenhouse state depends on cloud feedbacks.
This result has been borne out by models coupling surface climate
to magma ocean evolution, which show that Venus sits on the
threshold between long-lived magma ocean (never habitable) and
a brief initial magma ocean followed by ocean condensation
(Hamano et al. 2013). Cloud-free, 1D radiative-convective models
tend to predict a low runaway greenhouse threshold, thereby
suggesting that Venus has always been in a runaway greenhouse
state since formation (Goldblatt et al. 2013; Ramirez et al. 2014).
However, 3D GCM models have revealed that cloud feedbacks,
speciﬁcally high reﬂectivity caused by slow rotation and enhanced
dayside cloudiness, could have maintained temperate conditions
on Venus until 0.7 Ga (Way et al. 2016). Subsequent GCM
modeling showed that these cloud feedbacks could have even
maintained habitable surface conditions until today (Way & Del
Genio 2020). In this view,
the transition from habitable to
uninhabitable surface conditions was not necessarily caused by
insolation increases triggering a runaway greenhouse, but instead
by massive CO2 outgassing coincident with resurfacing around
0.7 Ga (Way & Del Genio 2020). In addition to insolation
changes and interior evolution forcings, orbital and tidal
interactions may have also contributed to Venus’s atmospheric
evolution (Innanen et al. 1998; Barnes et al. 2013; Kane et al.
2020).

The plausibility of past habitable climates depends on
whether these scenarios can be reconciled with Venusian
atmospheric evolution as constrained by observed composition
and the history of atmospheric escape. Crucially, Venus’s
modern atmosphere contains virtually no molecular oxygen,
with a <3 ppm upper limit above ∼60 km (Mills 1999). This
lack of oxygen must be reconciled with atmospheric water loss
large amounts of hydrogen would
since the escape of
seemingly predict signiﬁcant “leftover” oxygen accumulation.
Kasting & Pollack (1983) established that the hydrodynamic
loss of H is a viable mechanism for extensive early atmospheric
this may have contributed to observed D/H
loss and that
fractionation. Zahnle & Kasting (1986) modeled this hydro-
dynamic loss in more detail and concluded that a large amount
of oxygen could have been dragged off to space given the high
X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) of the early Sun. Subsequent
modeling of hydrodynamic H and O loss by Chasseﬁère (1996)
downgraded these O drag ﬂuxes and showed that,
in the
absence of other substantial oxygen sinks, the initial water
inventory could not have exceeded 0.45 Earth oceans without
avoiding substantial atmospheric oxygen accumulation (the
modern Venusian atmosphere has essentially no O2).

In light of this constraint, Gillmann et al. (2009) proposed a
self-consistent scenario for early hydrodynamic H loss. Starting
inventory of <5 terrestrial oceans, oxygen
with an initial
produced by early H loss may have been sequestered in an
early magma ocean, thereby avoiding later buildup. Vigorous
H escape during this initial magma ocean phase can also
reproduce observed Ar and Ne isotope ratios. Loss of water
would eventually trigger the solidiﬁcation of the magma ocean,
leaving behind small amounts of H and O, which could
plausibly be lost to space and consumed by surface sinks,
respectively (Gillmann et al. 2009). Such a scenario precludes
large surface oceans following magma ocean solidiﬁcation but
is agnostic on subsequent surface habitability with small water
reservoirs (Chasseﬁère et al. 2012). Broadly speaking, how-
ever, a Venus that has been in a runaway greenhouse state since
lack of
formation is easier to reconcile with the current
atmospheric oxygen. This is because recent water loss means
less solar XUV ﬂux to drive O drag, and thus larger interior
sinks are required to mop up atmospheric oxygen (e.g.,
Lammer et al. 2018).

Isotopes and trace gases have also been used to constrain
Venus’s atmospheric evolution. While observed D/H enhance-
ment is suggestive of water loss (Donahue et al. 1982), this is a
highly degenerate constraint. Vigorous hydrodynamic escape or
impact-induced atmospheric loss may not yield any isotopic
fractionation, and so observed D/H ratios provide a lower limit on
loss (Kasting & Pollack 1983; Zahnle et al. 1988).
water
Moreover, it may be possible to explain the observed D/H ratio as
a steady-state balance between recent water loss and resupply as
inventory
opposed to the remnant
(Grinspoon 1987), although the former requires a contemporary
water source more D/H-rich than comets (Grinspoon 1993).
in D/H fractionation by nonthermal escape
Uncertainties
processes and variation in D/H with altitude (Marcq et al.
2018) also complicate water
loss interpretations. Observed
isotopic ratios of 36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne seem to favor a rapid
accretion (Lammer et al. 2020), but these constraints are consistent
with a number of early escape scenarios and are largely agnostic
on subsequent habitability.

Venusian geomorphology and mineralogy may also provide
insights into climate evolution. The scarcity of craters and
apparent lack of crater modiﬁcation revealed by radar imagery
imply an average surface age <1 Gyr and have been
conventionally interpreted as reﬂecting a recent resurfacing
event (Schaber et al. 1992; Strom et al. 1994), although
equilibrium resurfacing cannot be excluded (Bjonnes et al.
2012). Indeed, ∼80% of craters have radar-dark ﬂoors, which
have been interpreted as postimpact lava ﬂows (Herrick &
Rumpf 2011), which suggests that some combination of
continuous, local resurfacing and regional lava ﬂows could
explain the crater distribution without recourse to catastrophic
resurfacing (O’Rourke et al. 2014). Resurfacing, whether by
catastrophic event or gradual crustal turnover, means that most
geologic records of Venus’s early history have been erased.
However, some surface regions, such as the highly deformed
tessera terrain, are conjectured to predate resurfacing (Hansen
& López 2010). This is of interest for past climate because
some tessera regions also have low-emissivity surfaces
attributed to felsic crust (Gilmore et al. 2015, 2017). Venera
13 elemental abundance measurements are also suggestive of
elevated K2O, felsic crust (McKenzie et al. 1992). The presence
of felsic crust is signiﬁcant because it may indicate past surface
water, although felsic crust formation can also be formed by
differentiation of anhydrous basaltic melts (Gilmore et al.
2015). Moreover, detections of felsic crust are not deﬁnitive
(Wroblewski et al. 2019). The tessera terrain show signs of
erosion (Byrne et al. 2021), potentially due to past ﬂuvial
processes (Khawja et al. 2020). The observed erosion features
could also be aeolian (Byrne et al. 2021), however, and so
neither mineralogical nor geomorphological observations
necessarily require a past hydrosphere.

Coupled atmospheric-interior models constrained by modern
atmospheric composition and surface conditions may also be
into Venus’s past evolution. Early
used to provide insight
conceptual models highlighted possible feedbacks between
surface climate and melt production (Phillips et al. 2001).
Driscoll & Bercovici (2013) used a carbon cycle box model
with a gray atmosphere to illustrate the divergent climate
histories of Venus and Earth. Sophisticated 2D and 3D mantle
convection models have also been applied to elucidate
feedbacks between tectonics,
resurfacing, outgassing, and
atmospheric evolution (Noack et al. 2012; Gillmann &
Tackley 2014). Gillmann et al. (2020) added late accretion
impact scenarios to a coupled atmosphere-interior evolution
model to determine how the modern atmosphere could be
recovered. They found that late accretion materials must have
been relatively volatile poor and that the total mass delivered
during late accretion is limited by the inefﬁcient oxygen loss
during the later stages of Venus’s evolution.

None of these coupled atmospheric-interior models expli-
citly explore the possibility of previous liquid surface water and
consistency with atmospheric redox evolution, however. Here,
we apply a coupled model of Venus’s evolution from post-
accretion magma ocean to the present, with the goal of
determining whether a habitable past is consistent with all
known atmospheric and surface constraints. Radiative-con-
vective climate, atmospheric escape, parameterized mantle
convection, and melt production/outgassing models are
coupled to track ﬂuxes of H-, C-, and O-bearing species
between the atmosphere and the interior and to constrain the
evolution of any surface liquid water inventory. The possibility

Figure 1. Schematic of the PACMAN geochemical evolution model applied to Venus. The redox budget, thermal-climate evolution, and volatile budget of Venus are
modeled from initial magma ocean (left) through to temperate geochemical cycling (right). Oxygen ﬂuxes are shown by green arrows, energy ﬂuxes by black arrows,
carbon ﬂuxes by orange arrows, and water ﬂuxes by blue arrows. Note that the net loss of H to space effectively adds oxygen to the atmosphere. During the magma
ocean phase, the radius of solidiﬁcation, rs, begins at the core–mantle boundary and moves toward the surface as internal heat is dissipated. The rate at which this
occurs is controlled by radiogenic heat production, qr, convective heat ﬂow from the mantle to the surface, qmantle, and heat ﬂow from the core, Qcore. This internal heat
ﬂow balances the difference between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and incoming absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR). The oxygen fugacity of the mantle, fO2,
and the water and carbon content of mantle and surface reservoirs are tracked throughout. Both plate tectonics and stagnant lid modes are permitted, and 40Ar (purple
arrow) and 4He (beige arrows) atmospheric accumulation is explicitly modeled. This schematic is an adapted and updated version from Krissansen-Totton
et al. (2021).

of subduction returning carbonates, hydrous minerals, or
oxidized crust to the mantle during temperate periods early in
Venus’s evolution is included. Moreover, we explicitly model
the redox evolution of the mantle and atmosphere from magma
ocean onward to evaluate whether habitable and nonhabitable
scenarios are consistent with the current lack of oxygen in the
modern atmosphere.

2. Methods

In this study, the Planetary Atmosphere, Crust, and MANtle
(PACMAN) geochemical evolution model is used to study
Venus.4 The model is adapted from Krissansen-Totton et al.
(2021) and is qualitatively summarized in Figure 1. The reader
is referred to this paper for the full description of the PACMAN
model. Here we summarize the key features necessary for
interpreting results. Modiﬁcations to the model for application
to Venus are also described below and in Appendix A.

Planetary evolution is divided into an initial magma ocean
phase and a subsequent solid-mantle phase. Post-core forma-
tion Venus is initialized with a fully molten mantle and some
endowment of volatiles, a radionuclide inventory (238U, 235U,
232Th, 40K), and an initial mantle oxygen fugacity (Figure 1,
left). The magma ocean freezes from the core upward, and H,
C, and O are partitioned between dissolved melt phases,
crystalline phases, and the atmosphere by assuming chemical
equilibrium. Heat ﬂow from the interior is calculated using
1D convective parameterization, with temperature-dependent
magma ocean viscosity.

Planetary oxidation may occur from the loss of hydrogen to
space (less oxygen drag); free oxygen produced via H escape is
dissolved in the melt and may be transferred to the solid mantle
as the magma ocean solidiﬁes (Schaefer et al. 2016). We
parameterized atmospheric escape as either diffusion limited or
XUV limited, depending on the composition of the mesosphere
and the stellar XUV ﬂux. During XUV-driven escape of a
steam-dominated atmosphere, the hydrodynamic escape of H
may drag along O (and even CO2) following Odert et al.
(2018). In contrast, if the upper atmosphere is mostly dry, then
the escape of H will be limited by the diffusion of hydrogen
through the background noncondensable atmosphere, and
neither O nor CO2 can escape. While only thermal escape is
considered in the nominal model, we also perform sensitivity
tests that include the nonthermal escape of oxygen ions over
Venus’s history (Kulikov et al. 2006; Persson et al. 2020).

A radiative-convective climate model

is used to self-
consistently calculate surface temperature, outgoing longwave
radiation (OLR), absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR),
the
water vapor proﬁle, and surface liquid water inventory (if any)
during both the magma ocean phase and subsequent temperate
evolution. OLR is a function of the surface H2O, CO2, and
background N2 inventories and is calculated using the publicly
available correlated-k radiative transfer code of Marcq et al.
(2017). This code uses DISORT (Stamnes et al. 1988) with
four-stream longwave radiative transfer. Correlated-k coefﬁ-
cients are calculated from the high-resolution molecular
absorption spectra computed with kspectrum (Eymet et al.
2016), H2O–H2O continuum absorption is taken from Clough
et al. (2005), and CO2–CO2 continuum absorption from ﬁts to
Venus observations (Bézard et al. 2011). H2O–CO2 continuum

Krissansen-Totton, Fortney, & Nimmo

opacity is not considered and is likely negligible compared
to H2O–H2O and CO2–CO2 continuum absorption (Ma &
Tipping 1992). The runaway greenhouse limit calculated using
the code of Marcq et al. (2017) closely agrees with line-by-line
calculations in Goldblatt et al. (2013). To obtain OLR in the
presence of condensable water vapor, a dry adiabat to moist
adiabat
to isothermal atmospheric structure is assumed
(Kasting 1988). While opacity sources are accurately quanti-
ﬁed, atmospheric chemistry and cloud feedbacks under high
pressure and/or steam-dominated atmospheres are challenging
to model (e.g., Goldblatt et al. 2013; Marcq et al. 2017; Bierson
& Zhang 2020; Boukrouche et al. 2021), especially for
transition states between temperate and runaway greenhouse
states. The atmospheric model outputs in this study should thus
be taken as best estimates rather
than rigorous climate
calculations. In nominal calculations, the temperature of the
isothermal upper atmosphere is randomly sampled from 180 to
220 K (see below), but in subsequent sensitivity tests upper
atmosphere temperature is allowed to vary as a function of
pCO2 (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2013).

Loss of water to space and dissipation of internal heat from
accretion and radionuclides eventually cause Venus’s surface
temperature to drop below the solidus. When this occurs, the
magma ocean phase is complete, and the model transitions to
solid-state mantle convection with temperate geochemical
cycling (Figure 1, right). During solid-state evolution, the only
source of oxygen remains atmospheric H escape. However,
there are now numerous crustal sinks for oxygen, including
both subaerial and submarine outgassing of reduced species
(e.g., H2, CO, CH4), water-rock reactions that generate H2, and
dry crustal oxidation. The sizes of these oxygen sinks are self-
consistently calculated from the planetary interior evolution
and mantle volatile content: outgassing ﬂuxes are calculated
using the melt-gas equilibrium outgassing model of Wogan
et al. (2020). Sulfur species are ignored in our nominal model
because,
for Earth-like bulk abundances, outgassing of
S-bearing gases only modestly increases total oxygen sinks
(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2021). Outgassing ﬂuxes depend on
mantle oxygen fugacity, degassing overburden pressure, the
volatile content of the mantle, speciﬁcally H2O and CO2
content, the rate at which melt is produced, and the tectonic
regime (see below). Dry and wet crustal sinks for oxygen
similarly depend on crustal production rates.

To estimate crustal production rates, both plate tectonics
(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2021) and stagnant lid regimes (Foley
& Smye 2018) are explicitly modeled. For full generality, we
assume a transition from plate tectonics to stagnant lid anytime
from 0.05 to 4 Gyr after magma ocean solidiﬁcation (randomly
sampled). This covers both end-member cases for Venus’s
tectonic evolution and ensures a stagnant lid regime for at least
the last ∼ 0.5 Gyr. During plate tectonics, outgassing ﬂuxes
depend on the product of crustal depth, spreading rate, and total
lid, outgassing ﬂuxes are
ridge length. During stagnant
controlled by the upwelling ﬂux of melt beneath the rigid lid,
as determined by a characteristic convection velocity and
convection cell
lithospheric and
length. The evolution of
crustal thickness is modeled following Foley & Smye (2018).
The thermal evolution of
the mantle during solid-state
evolution is calculated as follows: heat production from
radionuclides and heat ﬂow from the metallic core is balanced
by convective and advective transport to the surface. Core heat
ﬂow is imposed and is assumed to be at the upper limit of what

is consistent with the
absence of a modern dynamo
(Nimmo 2002; Driscoll & Bercovici 2014). Appendix A
provides further details on internal evolution and tectonic
parameterizations.

Silicate weathering (Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018) and the
deep hydrological cycle (Schaefer & Sasselov 2015) are also
explicitly modeled because climate and surface volatile
inventories control crustal oxygen sinks and atmospheric
escape processes. Carbon is added to the atmosphere via
magmatic outgassing (described above) and—if surface liquid
water exists—is returned via continental and seaﬂoor weath-
ering, whose relative contributions depend on climate and the
total surface water inventory.

2.1. Treatment of Volatiles

The model tracks C-, H-, and O-bearing species, as well as
Fe3+/Fe2+ speciation in the interior. Speciﬁcally, surface and
mantle inventories of CO2, H2O, and O2 are explicitly
calculated. While our outgassing model self-consistently calcu-
lates outgassing ﬂuxes of CO2, H2O, CO, H2, and CH4 from
melt properties (Wogan et al. 2020) and H2 ﬂuxes from
serpentinization, all outgassed reductants (CO, H2, CH4) are
assumed to instantaneously deplete atmospheric oxygen. In the
absence of atmospheric O2, all H from H-bearing reductants is
assumed to be rapidly lost to space, therefore net oxidizing the
planet; H escape via outgassed H2 and CH4 will be rapid
because, unlike H2O, these species are not cold trapped. The
limitations of our climate module and absence of a photo-
chemical model mean that we cannot simulate the time evolution
of more reducing bulk atmospheres (i.e., CO–H2 dominated). An
oxidized atmosphere is a common assumption in Venus
evolution models (e.g., Driscoll & Bercovici 2013; Gillmann
& Tackley 2014; Gillmann et al. 2020), but
the possible
limitations of this assumption are explored in Section 4, and
sensitivity tests are presented. During melt production, volatiles
are partitioned between solid and melt phases using a constant

dent graphite-saturated partitioning for carbon (see Text G in
Krissansen-Totton et al. 2021, which follows Ortenzi et al.

a constant N2 background partial pressure in all model runs:
1 bar is assumed in the nominal model, but sensitivity tests for
0.5–3 bar N2 partial pressures are also presented.

2.2. Monte Carlo Calculations and Unknown Parameters

There are many unknown parameters and initial conditions
in the model, including temperature-dependent mantle viscos-
ities, efﬁciencies of XUV-driven escape, uncertain early Sun
XUV ﬂuxes, carbon cycle feedbacks, deep hydrological cycle
dependencies,
tectonic regime transition time, and albedo
parameterizations. We adopted a Monte Carlo approach, where
we ran the model thousands of times uniformly sampling all
24 unknown parameters. Parameter ranges for key variables
are shown in Table A1. Unknown parameters that are
particularly important for Venus’s evolution include the dry
crustal oxidation efﬁciency, fdry−oxid, which is the fraction of
Fe2+ in newly produced crust
is oxidized to Fe3+ in
the presence of an oxidizing atmosphere via nonaqueous
reactions. This parameter is sampled uniformly in log space
from 10−4 to 10% and includes a range of physical processes,
including the diffusion of oxygen into extrusive lava ﬂows

(Gillmann et al. 2009), direct oxidation of small grain erosion
products (Arvidson et al. 1992), and other gas–solid redox
reactions (Zolotov 2019), including aerosol oxidation follow-
ing explosive volcanism (Warren & Kite 2021). We endow
Venus with anywhere from 2% to 200% Earth oceans by mass,
and ∼40–600 bar CO2 (extending these ranges to larger initial
inventories does not recover modern Venus constraints). Initial
free O (2 × 1021–6 × 1021 kg) is chosen to recover an Earth-
like modern mantle oxygen fugacity, but sensitivity tests are
considered with more reducing mantles. Parameter ranges for
mantle viscosity span three orders of magnitude and were
chosen to broadly represent silicate mantles of Earth-sized
planets (Krissansen-Totton et al. 2021), and as noted above, the
transition time from plate tectonics to stagnant lid is sampled
from ∼ 4.5 to 0.5 Ga for full generality (Table A1). Parameter
ranges governing carbon cycle and deep hydrological cycle
feedbacks were derived from Earth values (Krissansen-Totton
et al. 2021).
Another

is planetary albedo. To
calculate ASR over a wide range of temperatures, we adopted
the albedo parameterization described in Pluriel et al. (2019),
which deﬁnes a temperate state albedo and a runaway
greenhouse state albedo. Rather than explicitly model complex
cloud feedbacks, the albedo of the temperate state is a free
parameter ranging from 0.2 to 0.7. Although we are not
explicitly modeling cloud feedbacks, this agnostic approach
allows us to test to what extent cloud feedbacks maintaining
habitability are consistent with Venus’s thermal, geochemical,
and atmospheric evolution.

important parameter

In addition to tracking C-, H-, and O-bearing species, the
Venus model calculates the accumulation of atmospheric 40Ar
and 4He. 40Ar is a decay product of 40K and is released into the
atmosphere when K- and Ar-bearing mantle rock is melted and
brought to the surface. Since 40Ar is not removed from the
atmosphere once degassed, the total inventory is a measure of
cumulative magmatic activity over a planet’s history (Pollack
& Black 1982; Kaula 1999; O’Rourke & Korenaga 2015).
Similarly, 4He is a decay product of uranium and thorium that
is released during outgassing, but unlike 40Ar, 4He is lost to
space on 108 yr timescales (Krasnopolsky & Gladstone 2005).
The atmospheric inventory of 4He is therefore a measure of
more recent magmatic activity (Chasseﬁere et al. 1986; Namiki
& Solomon 1998; Fedorov et al. 2011). Including 40Ar and 4He
in our model provides an additional way for testing for self-
consistency against
the observed Venusian atmosphere and
enables us to determine whether a habitable or nonhabitable
Venusian past better predicts the modern atmosphere.

3. Results

The coupled model was run 10,000 times randomly sampling
all 24 unknown parameters, and the time evolution of each
model run spans from post-accretionary magma ocean to the
present day. We focus on only those model runs that could
reproduce modern Venus atmospheric composition (Arney et al.
2014), as deﬁned by 40–200 bar pCO2, <∼0.2 mbar pO2
(<1015 kg), and <∼3 mbar pH2O (<2 × 1016 kg). We do not
limits
require strict consistency with observed O2 upper
(Mills 1999) because we omit photochemistry. In any case,
modifying these acceptance thresholds does not change any of
our qualitative conclusions.

Of the 10,000 model runs, about 10% successfully recover
modern Venus as deﬁned by these atmospheric criteria.

Moreover,
these Venus reproductions fall neatly into two
categories: those where Venus was never habitable, and those
where Venus experienced an epoch of surface habitability
before returning to runaway greenhouse.

Figure 2 shows all model runs that successfully reproduce the
modern Venusian atmosphere and where Venus was never
habitable (i.e., no surface liquid water). Figure 2(a) shows the
thermal evolution of the mantle and the surface from magma
ocean to today, where mantle potential
temperature is the
temperature a parcel of mantle would have if it ascended to the
surface adiabatically. Figure 2(b) shows the evolution of the
magma ocean radius of solidiﬁcation. Consistent with previous
studies (Hamano et al. 2013), we ﬁnd that the duration of the
magma ocean depends on planetary albedo and initial water
abundance. Figure 2(c) shows the coupled evolution of atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen. Note the catastrophic
degassing of water during magma ocean solidiﬁcation and the
subsequent gradual loss of water to space. Water dissociation
and the subsequent escape of hydrogen leave behind molecular
oxygen, which is then consumed by crustal sinks. Figure 2(d)
conﬁrms that liquid water never condenses on the surface in any
model runs. Figure 2(e) shows the planetary energy budget,
including ASR, OLR, heat ﬂow from the interior (qm), and the
runaway greenhouse limit for reference. The onset/end of a
runaway greenhouse state occurs when the absorbed shortwave
crosses the runaway greenhouse threshold. The model success-
the modern heat ﬂow, around
fully recovers estimates of
20 mW m−2 (Nimmo & McKenzie 1998).

Figures 2(g) and (j) show the evolution of melt production
respectively. By deﬁnition, both melt
and crustal depth,
production and crustal depth assume positive values only after
magma ocean solidiﬁcation is complete. The modern crustal
depth is broadly consistent with estimates from the literature
ranging from 20 to 60 km (Smrekar 1994; Simons et al. 1997;
Nimmo & McKenzie 1998), although our crustal thickness may
overestimate the modern crust since we are ignoring foundering
below the basalt−eclogite transition (O’Rourke & Korenaga
2012). The abrupt transition in crustal thickness marks the
change from a plate tectonics regime to stagnant lid regime.

Figure 2(h) shows the evolution of mantle redox state
relative to the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) buffer, and
Figure 2(i) shows the redox budget of the atmosphere. The net
ﬂux in Figure 2(i) dictates the evolution of atmospheric oxygen
in Figure 2(c). Hydrogen escape (minus oxygen drag) is a
source of oxygen, whereas the oxidation of newly produced
crust (“dry crustal”) is a sink. Note that in this scenario there is
no oxygen consumption via water−rock reactions because
water never condenses on the surface. Additionally, both water
and carbon outgassing are negligible (Figure 2(f)) because,
even though melt production is high (Figure 2(g)), the mantle is
left relatively desiccated after the magma ocean phase. This,
combined with the high pressures of a thick CO2-dominated
atmosphere, means that what few mantle volatiles remain tend
to partition into the melt and do not degas into the atmosphere
(Figure 2(f)). Volatile quantities in the solid mantle as a
fraction of total mantle and surface volatile reservoirs are
plotted in Figure 2(l). The sensitivity of our results to retention
of volatiles during magma ocean solidiﬁcation is explored
below, and we ﬁnd that greater retention of volatiles in the
mantle does not qualitatively change this scenario. Finally, we
note that these model runs also reproduce the observed 40Ar
abundance in the atmosphere and make 4He abundance

values, and shaded regions denote 95% conﬁdence intervals. The time evolution spans from post-accretionary magma ocean to the present day (4.5 × 109 yr). Panel
(a) shows the evolution of mantle potential temperature (blue) and surface temperature (red) over the last 4.5 Gyr. The initial magma ocean (panel (b)) persists from
anywhere between a few thousand years to millions of years, depending on initial volatile endowments and planetary albedo. Water catastrophically degasses from the
magma ocean and is subsequently lost to space via hydrodynamic escape (panels (c) and (f)). In these never-habitable model runs, the absorbed shortwave radiation
never drops below the runaway greenhouse limit (panel (e)), and so liquid water never condenses on the surface (panel (d)). Atmospheric oxygen may be produced via
escape during the steam-dominated atmosphere (panel (c)), but this oxygen is drawn down by geological sinks (panel (i)). Volatile cycling is controlled by the rate at
which fresh crust is produced (panels (g) and (h)). While melt production continues throughout Venus’s history, outgassing is negligible because the mantle is left
desiccated after the magma ocean and high pressures ensure that volatiles are retained in partial melts (panel (f)). Panel (l) shows water and carbon dioxide in the solid
interior as a fraction of total interior and surface reservoirs. The model successfully recovers modern atmospheric 40Ar (panel (k)), modern heat ﬂow (panel (e)),

sufﬁciently such that OLR drops below the runaway green-
house limit (Figure 3(e)), atmospheric water vapor condenses
out of the atmosphere (Figure 3(c)) and onto the surface
(Figure 3(d)). Globally averaged ocean depths of a few hundred
meters are typical, although there are several model runs with
oceans around 1 km deep (Figure 3(d)). While conditions are
right for surface liquid water, carbon cycle feedbacks are active
(Figure 3(f)). Speciﬁcally,
the silicate weathering feedback
removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Figure 3(c)) and
sequesters it in the interior (Figure 3(l)). During this habitable
phase, both carbon dioxide and water are returned to the mantle
via subduction (plate tectonics) or slab delamination (stagnant
lid), which allows for continuous outgassing (Figure 3(f)). On
long timescales, outgassing and weathering carbon ﬂuxes are
balanced.

Eventually, since a constant albedo is assumed, the secular
increase in solar luminosity triggers a transition back into
runaway greenhouse. When ASR once again exceeds the
runaway greenhouse limit (Figure 3(e)), all surface liquid water
is converted to water vapor (Figure 3(d)). Atmospheric carbon
dioxide also begins to rise because weathering reactions cease
while the outgassing of carbon dioxide may continue. Note that

The duration of surface habitability in Figure 3 ranges from

and oxygen late in Venus’s evolution (see discussion).

depth (Figure 3(j)) are comparable to the nonhabitable
scenarios, as are atmospheric 40Ar (Figure 3(k)) and 4He
(Figure 3(l)) evolutions. While oxygen is still being produced
from net water loss throughout Venus’s history, it is ultimately
removed via a combination of crustal and outgassing sinks
(Figure 3(i)), leading to an oxygen-free modern atmosphere
(Figure 3(c)).

values, and shaded regions denote 95% conﬁdence intervals. The time evolution spans from post-accretionary magma ocean to the present day (4.5 × 109 yr). Panel
(a) shows the evolution of mantle potential temperature (blue) and surface temperature (red) over the last 4.5 Gyr. The initial magma ocean (panel (b)) persists from
anywhere between a few thousand years to a few million years, depending on initial volatiles, consistent with previous studies (Hamano et al. 2013). The magma
ocean ends when Venus’s interior cools such that heat ﬂow from the interior drops below the runaway greenhouse limit (panel (e)). When this occurs, atmospheric
water vapor (panel (c)) condenses onto the surface, producing a global ocean a few hundred meters deep (panel (d)). A temperate carbon cycle also commences (panel
(f)), where volatile cycling is controlled by the rate at which fresh crust is produced (panels (g) and (h)). Oxygen production is low for most of Venus’s temperate
history because H escape is diffusion limited through a dry upper atmosphere (panel (i)). Eventually, increasing solar luminosity triggers a transition back into
runaway greenhouse (panel (e)). When this occurs, surface oceans vaporize (panel (d)), weathering reactions cease (panel (f)), and outgassing returns carbon dioxide to
the atmosphere (panel (c)). Panel (l) shows water and carbon dioxide in the solid interior as a fraction of total interior and surface reservoirs. The model successfully

3.1. Parameters Controlling Venus’s Geochemical Evolution

and were never habitable

Next, we consider which variables control whether modern
Venusian conditions are recovered, and why only some model
runs permit a habitable past. Figure 4 shows circles represent-
ing a sample of individual model runs. Magenta circles are the
model outputs in Figure 2 that recover the modern Venusian
(“never-habitable
atmosphere
Venus”); yellow circles are the model outputs in Figure 3 that
recover the modern Venusian atmosphere and were transiently
habitable (“habitable Venus”). Cyan circles show other model
runs that do not recover modern atmospheric CO2, H2O, and
O2 abundances (“failed Venus”). Bold axes show input values
such as initial conditions and other parameter choices, whereas
nonbold axes show output values such as ﬁnal atmospheric
abundances after 4.5 Gyr of evolution. Figure 4(a) shows ﬁnal
atmospheric oxygen after 4.5 Gyr as a function of the efﬁciency
of dry crustal oxidation. Note that both never-habitable and
transient-habitable Venus scenarios typically require a rela-
tively efﬁcient crustal sink for oxygen, whereby >0.1% of iron
in newly produced crust is oxidized. Less efﬁcient crustal sinks
leave behind too much atmospheric oxygen.

Figure 4(b) shows the spread of bond albedo values for all
model runs. As expected, all successful model runs that were
transiently habitable (yellow) have a bond albedo >0.4. These

7

transiently habitable outputs could represent a scenario
described in Way & Del Genio (2020), where high albedos
due to cloudiness at the substellar point (enabled by Venus’s
slow rotation) can maintain a temperate surface. There is a
negative correlation between albedo and initial water
for
habitable scenarios. This is because higher albedos imply
longer periods of transient habitability, and it is more difﬁcult
to remove the leftover water when Venus reenters runaway
the solar XUV ﬂux diminishes
greenhouse late since
exponentially with time. This is also reﬂected in Figure 4(f),
which shows the relationship between albedo and maximum
ocean depth. Deep (∼1 km) oceans are only permitted for low
bond albedos since this enables earlier and more vigorous water
loss while solar XUV ﬂuxes are high.

Figure 4(c) shows what initial water and carbon dioxide
inventories are required to reproduce modern Venus condi-
tions, compared to the full range sampled in our model. These
results suggest that Venus must have formed with, at most, a
few Earth oceans worth of water to be desiccated today
(although note that we neglect
from nonthermal
processes such as impact-induced loss). Figure 4(c) also
suggests that Venus’s initial endowment of carbon was
comparable to the modern atmospheric reservoir. Figure 4(d)
shows the ﬁnal water and carbon dioxide evolution of all model
runs after 4.5 Gyr of evolution. The broad parameterizations in

successfully recovered the modern Venusian atmosphere and were never habitable (Figure 2), yellow circles represent model runs that successfully recovered the
modern Venusian atmosphere and were habitable in the past (Figure 3), and cyan circles represent other model runs that did not recover modern atmospheric
composition (either too much modern water vapor or molecular oxygen, or too little CO2). Bold axes represent independent variables (initial conditions or input
parameters), and nonbold axes represent model outputs. Panel (a) shows the ﬁnal atmospheric oxygen after 4.5 Gyr as a function of the dry crustal oxidation
efﬁciency; the modern low-oxygen atmosphere implies relatively efﬁcient crustal oxidation over much of Venus’s history. Panel (b) shows the assumed bond albedo
compared to initial water inventory; transient habitable requires an average albedo exceeding 0.4. Panel (c) shows initial water inventories and initial carbon dioxide
inventories, panel (d) shows ﬁnal atmospheric CO2 inventories and ﬁnal atmospheric water inventories, panel (e) shows ﬁnal atmospheric oxygen as a function of
upper atmosphere temperature, panel (f) shows peak ocean depth as a function of albedo, panel (g) shows ﬁnal atmospheric oxygen as a function of initial mantle
redox, and panels (h) and (i) show the relationships between initial water inventory, solar XUV saturation time, and initial radiogenic inventory.

our model permit a number of evolutionary scenarios that do
not recover modern Venus, e.g., planets for which not all water
is lost and (high-albedo) planets that remain habitable after
4.5 Gyr with most CO2 sequestered in the mantle (Figure 4(d)).
Figures 4(g), (h), and (i) show that results are relatively
insensitive to initial mantle redox state, the XUV saturation
the early Sun, and the radionuclide inventory,
time of
respectively. However,
it should be noted that very low
radionuclide inventories (<0.75 that of Earth) are disfavored
for habitable Venus owing to the need for comparatively large
and recent oxygen sinks, which are driven by melt production
rates. The lack of any XUV evolution dependence is
attributable to the most important, late stages of atmospheric
loss being diffusion limited rather than XUV limited (see next

section). A broader range of initial mantle redox conditions are
also considered below.

3.2. Radiative Cooling of the Upper Atmosphere Favors a
Habitable Past Climate
Figure 4(e) shows ﬁnal atmospheric oxygen after 4.5 Gyr
as a function of upper atmosphere temperature. Both habitable
and nonhabitable past climates are favored when average
upper atmosphere temperature exceeds ∼190 K. However,
the atmosphere of modern Venus between the cloud deck
and the homopause typically reaches cooler temperatures,
around 150–180 K (Pätzold et al. 2007; Mahieux et al.
2015). This is due, in part, to strong radiative cooling from
carbon dioxide (e.g., Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2013;

Figure 5. Transient habitability is required to recover modern Venus conditions if strong radiative cooling of the upper atmosphere throttles H escape. Nominal
calculations were repeated except that the upper atmosphere temperature responds to CO2 mixing ratio, as described in the text. All model outputs that recover modern
Venus conditions are plotted. The lines are median values, and shaded regions denote 95% conﬁdence intervals. Panels are the same as in Figure 3. A period of
transient habitability (panels (a) and (d)) allows pCO2 to be sequestered in the interior via weathering and subduction (panel (f)), thereby enabling greater subsequent
water loss and a plausible ﬁt to the modern atmosphere (panel (c)). There are virtually no equivalent never-habitable model outputs that reproduce modern Venus when
strong radiative cooling of the upper atmosphere is assumed.

where we allow the isothermal upper atmosphere temperature,

This is a crude parameterization that ensures Earth-like
stratospheric temperatures (214 K)
for N2-O2 dominated
atmospheres and modern Venus-like upper atmosphere tem-
peratures (170 K) for CO2-dominated upper atmospheres. If
this parameterization may underestimate radiative
anything,
cooling from CO2; observed minimum temperatures
in
Venus’s homosphere are frequently <170 K (Pätzold et al.
2007; Mahieux et al. 2015), and theoretical calculations of
upper atmosphere temperature proﬁles for varying pCO2 and
stellar insolation also yield cooler temperatures (Wordsworth &
Pierrehumbert 2013).

When Equation (1) is adopted and all calculations are repeated,
there are virtually no model runs that successfully reproduce
modern Venus without transient habitability (the 2/7000 “never-
habitable” model runs that do require extremely efﬁcient dry
oxidation, ∼10%, and even then only recover a 50 bar CO2
modern atmosphere). This is because carbon dioxide throttles the
escape of hydrogen when water concentrations are low. The
escape of water is limited by the rate at which hydrogen-bearing
species diffuse through the background atmosphere, and cooler

9

temperatures lower water concentrations in the upper atmosphere.
Under never-habitable scenarios the atmosphere was continu-
ously CO2 dominated since accretion owing to the low solubility
of carbon dioxide in the magma ocean, and so this CO2 throttling
limits Venus from losing enough water to recover the modern
atmosphere.

In contrast, it is possible to recover modern Venus conditions
with radiative cooling of the upper atmosphere if transient
habitability is permitted. Figure 5 shows all model runs that
successfully cover modern Venus conditions when the para-
meterization described by Equation (1) is adopted. If surface
water condenses, then carbon dioxide is weathered out of the
atmosphere and sequestered as carbonates (Figures 5(c), (f)).
Water loss may then occur during the moist greenhouse phase,
when the dominant background gas is nitrogen. Moreover, when
the planet reenters the runaway greenhouse, there is a transient
steam atmosphere where enhanced water loss may occur. It takes
time for CO2 from outgassing to accumulate to throttle further
escape. This dynamic can be seen in Figure 5(c), where
atmospheric water vapor increases from the evaporating ocean
before pCO2 is massively degassed,
thus providing a short
window for water loss. This sequence of events can also been
seen in Figure 6, which depicts the “habitable Venus” outputs
from Figure 5, as well as a selection of failed Venus model
outputs that never recover modern conditions owing to water loss
being throttled by strong radiative cooling.

Figure 6. Transient habitability is needed to recover modern Venus if strong radiative cooling of the upper atmosphere throttles H escape. The time evolutions (in
Myr) of atmospheric carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen are shown for the outputs in Figure 5, denoted here by squares. A number of other model runs that fail to
recover modern Venus conditions are shown as circles. The x-axes and y-axes denote atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide, respectively, whereas the color bar
shows atmospheric oxygen. Note that there are no “never-habitable” model runs that recover modern Venus in this ﬁgure because radiative cooling throttles escape.
Only by passing through a transient-habitable state whereby pCO2 is lowered by silicate weathering can upper atmosphere temperatures increase such that sufﬁcient
water can escape to explain the modern desiccated atmosphere. The comparatively few circles for which water is lost have too much leftover oxygen to match the
observed atmosphere. An animation of the time evolution is available in the online Journal. The animation spans the full time shown in the static ﬁgure (0–4469.77
Myr) and progressing at a variable time step.
(An animation of this ﬁgure is available.)

4. Discussion

The most important result to emerge from these calculations
is that both a habitable Venusian past and a nonhabitable
Venusian past can be broadly reconciled with modern
constraints. Either scenario may produce a CO2-dominated
atmosphere with negligible oxygen and water vapor, modern
interior heat ﬂow, and atmospheric 40Ar and 4He abundances
that are consistent with observations. This emphasizes the need
for in situ observations to better constrain past atmospheric
evolution and surface conditions. The upcoming possibility of
characterizing the atmospheres of Venus-like exoplanets
provides additional motivation for understanding Venus’s
evolution (Ehrenreich et al. 2012; Kane et al. 2019). Simulated
observations suggest that the James Webb Space Telescope
may be capable of constraining the atmospheric composition
(Barstow et al. 2016; Lustig-Yaeger et al. 2019a), and perhaps
even the atmospheric isotopologues (Lincowski et al. 2019), of
exo-Venus analogs such as Trappist-1b, c, and d, GJ 1132b,
and LHS 3844b. Ultimately, a larger sample of TESS exo-
Venus candidates may be characterizable with Webb (Ostberg
& Kane 2019), although high-altitude aerosols could preclude
deﬁnitive assessment of total atmospheric inventories (Lustig-
Yaeger et al. 2019b). Figure 4(d) shows that, in addition to the
never-habitable and transiently habitable histories that are the
focus of this study, dramatically different modern states are
permitted by our model. For example, continuously habitable
planets or water-rich runaway greenhouses with widely
variable atmospheric oxygen levels are all self-consistent

model outcomes after 4.5 Gyr of evolution (Figures 4(a), (d)).
Understanding why Venus avoided these outcomes and
constraining the climate evolution trajectory it underwent to
reach its observed state will help inform the interpretation of
exo-Venus analog atmospheres. Conversely,
the population
level data on exo-Venus analogs expected from upcoming
observations will help inform reconstructions of Venus’s
atmospheric evolution.

4.1. Sensitivity of Results to Ion Escape, Mantle Depletion,
Magma Ocean Volatile Partitioning, and Initial Mantle Redox

Our results are largely insensitive to model assumptions
about escape and the evolution of volatile reservoirs during the
In the nominal model outputs shown in
magma ocean.
Figures 2 and 3, we consider only XUV-driven hydrodynamic
escape of H (with O and CO2 drag) and diffusion-limited H
escape. The diffusion limit to H escape applies to both thermal
and nonthermal escape processes. However, it is likely that
nonthermal oxygen ion escape also contributed signiﬁcantly to
Venus’s atmospheric evolution (Kulikov et al. 2006; Gillmann
et al. 2020; Persson et al. 2020). To test the effect of this, we
conducted a sensitivity test where we imposed O ion escape
estimates from Kulikov et al. (2006; their case 2b). The results
of these calculations are shown in full
in the Appendices
(Figure B1), but in summary, we ﬁnd that O ion escape does
not change our qualitative conclusions. This is because ion
escape becomes small after 3.5 Ga, and so it does not help
remove excess oxygen from late water loss; efﬁcient crustal

Krissansen-Totton, Fortney, & Nimmo

sinks and comparatively small initial water reservoirs are still
required.

In our nominal calculations, the silicate solidus depends on
pressure overburden but is independent of composition. Under
a stagnant
lid regime, melt accumulation in the lid may
progressively deplete the mantle, resulting in an increasing
solidus. Melt production—and therefore oxygen sinks—may
thus decline over time. To test the impact of mantle depletion,
we repeated our calculations allowing for the evolution of the
solidus with melt extraction from the mantle. This is described
in full in Appendix B.1, and results are shown in Figures B2
and B3. Although the modern average melt production in these
sensitivity tests is around half that of the nominal model
(Figures B2(g), B3(g)),
the habitable and never-habitable
model outputs are otherwise unchanged, and the proportions
of model runs that successfully recover modern Venus are also
indistinguishable from nominal calculations. This is because
while decreasing melt production lessens the size of oxygen
sinks, it also limits the resupply of water via degassing, which
helps recover the desiccated modern Venus atmosphere.

The magma ocean phase in the nominal model terminates
with virtually all carbon (and most water) residing in the
atmosphere owing to the low solubility of carbon dioxide in
silicate melts (Figures 2(l), 3(l)). This is consistent with
comparable magma ocean evolution models which assume that
volatile partitioning is governed by melt solubility (Lebrun
et al. 2013; Schaefer et al. 2016; Salvador et al. 2017).
However, volatiles could become trapped within the mantle
during magma ocean solidiﬁcation owing to compaction within
the moving freezing front (e.g., Hier-Majumder & Hirschmann
2017). To test the impact of such volatile retention, we repeated
our nominal calculations accounting for melt trapping during
magma ocean solidiﬁcation (see Appendix B.2). We adopt a
compaction timescale of ∼1 Myr, which results in much higher
retained volatile fractions than assuming constant melt fraction
trapping or merely accounting for equilibrium partitioning of
volatiles into cumulates (Elkins-Tanton 2008; Hier-Majumder
& Hirschmann 2017; Nikolaou et al. 2019); this sensitivity test
represents an end-member case with maximum volatile
retention during magma ocean solidiﬁcation. Figure B4 shows
all the never-habitable model outputs from this sensitivity test,
and Figure B5 shows all the transiently habitable model outputs
from this sensitivity test. In these cases, approximately 70% of
total water and 6% of total CO2 resides in the solid mantle after
magma ocean solidiﬁcation (Figures B4(l), B5(l)). Outgassing
ﬂuxes are enhanced in both cases (Figures B4(f), B5(f)), but
outputs are otherwise comparable to Figures 2 and 3,
respectively. This demonstrates that a desiccated initial mantle
is not required to recover modern Venus. One key difference,
however, is that habitable scenarios are far less frequent: there
are 85% fewer habitable model runs compared to nominal
calculations. This is because when ∼70% of the initial water
inventory is retained in the mantle, comparatively large water
outgassing ﬂuxes continue for several Gyr, and so it is difﬁcult
to explain the low modern atmospheric water abundance. In
contrast, never-habitable scenarios are unaffected because (i)
the pressure overburden of a ∼100 bar CO2 atmosphere inhibits
H2O exsolution from partial melts, resulting in less atmospheric
H2O replenishment, and (ii) never-habitable Venuses are
typically desiccated earlier
in their history compared to
transiently habitable Venuses, which undergo a more recent
runaway greenhouse.

11

The range of

initial mantle redox states

in nominal
calculations was chosen to recover an Earth-like QFM modern
mantle. While there is some evidence for a strongly oxidized
Venus surface (Fegley et al. 1997), Venus’s mantle redox has
never been measured. More reducing initial redox states are
possible (Armstrong et al. 2019; Sossi et al. 2020), and so all
calculations were repeated with a lower free oxygen initial
reservoir: (0.3–1.5) × 1021 kg free O compared to (2.0–6.0) ×
1021 kg in the nominal model. This ensures a modern mantle
redox state closer to the iron–wustite (IW) buffer. Figure B6
shows the model outputs from this sensitivity test that recover
modern Venus and were never habitable, whereas Figure B7
shows the outputs that recover modern Venus and experi-
enced transient habitability. Decreasing mantle redox has
various impacts on geochemical evolution. More reduced
partial melts tend to produce more reducing gases, but carbon
into solid graphite under
also preferentially partitions
reducing conditions lowering total outgassing ﬂuxes. These
two effects partially offset one another, and the overall impact
on oxygen sinks is small. Additionally,
lowered carbon
outgassing due to graphite saturated conditions makes it
challenging to restore a ∼90 bar CO2-dominated atmosphere
via outgassing after CO2 drawdown during a habitable epoch,
and so there are slightly fewer “habitable” model runs than in
nominal calculations (27% fewer). Otherwise, lowering initial
mantle redox has a minor effect on Venus’s geochemical
evolution, with the additional caveat that our model does not
permit CO-dominated atmospheres and instead assumes that
all outgassed CO is photochemically oxidized to CO2 (see
discussion below).

4.2. Sensitivity to Atmospheric N2 Abundance
Modern Venus’s atmosphere contains ∼3 bar N2, but there is
considerable uncertainty in the evolution of this inventory,
especially if Venus experienced temperate surface conditions.
The evolution of atmospheric nitrogen ought to have negligible
impact on the “never-habitable” scenarios: when the atmos-
phere is always dominated by carbon dioxide and water vapor,
the comparatively small amount of background N2 will not
impact atmospheric escape substantially. However, if Venus
did experience transient habitability,
then the background
nitrogen inventory could have impacted planetary redox
evolution. This is because, in the absence of a thick CO2
atmosphere, N2 is the primary noncondensable species that
forms
loss and oxygen
accumulation (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2014; Kleinböhl
et al. 2018). Predictive modeling of nitrogen atmospheric
evolution on temperate planets is challenging, however. The
evolution of Earth’s atmospheric nitrogen inventory is
uncertain owing to lack of constraints on abiotic ﬁxation
pathways and the post-accretion partitioning of nitrogen
between the silicate mantle and surface volatile reservoirs.
(Stüeken et al. 2016; Wordsworth 2016; Johnson & Goldblatt
2018; Lammer et al. 2019). In our nominal calculations we
assumed an Earth-like inventory of 1 bar N2 atmospheric
nitrogen that is constant throughout Venus’s evolution, but note
that efﬁcient abiotic nitrogen ﬁxation could yield enhanced H
loss and oxygen accumulation. On the other hand, efﬁcient
nitrogen drawdown would enable more rapid water loss during
runaway greenhouse, potentially allowing deeper global oceans
to be compatible with modern conditions.

Figure 7. Habitable Venus scenarios are largely unaffected by background N2 pressure. Each circle represents a model run that successfully recovers modern Venus
conditions and experienced transient habitability. Red circles assume a constant background N2 pressure of 0.5 bar, blue circles 1 bar (nominal model), and green
circles 3 bar. Panels and axes are the same as in Figure 4: bold axes represent independent variables (initial conditions or input parameters), and nonbold axes represent
model outputs. Lower background N2 pressure results in slightly more model runs that recover modern Venus with transient habitability (H escape more rapid), but the
trends and relationships between unknown parameters are unchanged.

To test the impact of possible N2 changes on our results, we
performed sensitivity tests with background N2 abundances of
3 and 0.5 bars. Figure 7 shows results from these sensitivity
run that
tests where each circle is an individual model
recovered modern Venus conditions and experienced past
habitability. Red circles represent calculations where a 0.5 bar
constant N2 background was assumed, blue circles 1 bar N2,
and green circles 3 bar N2. Bold axes show input values such as
initial conditions and other parameter choices, whereas nonbold
axes show output values such as ﬁnal atmospheric abundances
after 4.5 Gyr of evolution (axes identical to Figure 4). While
the parameter values required for a habitable Venus do not
change substantially with atmospheric pressure (Figure 7),
increasing atmospheric pressure to 3 bars decreases the number
of habitable Venus model runs by around 40%, whereas
decreasing atmospheric pressure to 0.5 bars increases the
number of habitable Venus model runs by 56%. As expected,
runs that
there is no change in the number of model

successfully recover modern Venus without experiencing
transient habitability when N2 partial pressure is varied (not
shown).

4.3. Evidence for a Habitable Ancient Venus?

Our model provides tentative evidence for a habitable
Venusian past owing to the CO2 throttling of hydrogen
escape in nonhabitable scenarios. If radiative cooling of the
upper atmosphere is incorporated into our escape parameter-
ization, then never-habitable model runs cannot successfully
reproduce modern Venus’s lack of atmospheric water vapor
and oxygen (Figures 5, 6). Additionally, escape ﬂuxes are
potentially overestimated since we assume that water
molecules are completely dissociated to atomic hydrogen
and oxygen prior to diffusive transport (e.g., Catling &
Kasting 2017). Real escape ﬂuxes could be even lower if
hydrogen is retained in water molecules during diffusive
transport through a CO2–N2 background atmosphere (e.g.,

12

Krissansen-Totton, Fortney, & Nimmo

Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2013). This would make
nonhabitable scenarios even less likely to recover modern
Venus conditions owing to the additional throttling of water
loss (see Appendix A.6 for escape assumptions).

There are several important caveats to this result, however.
Crucially, for never-habitable model runs, water is the only
hydrogen-bearing species in our model that can escape. Other
hydrogen-bearing species, such as H2 and CH4, are not limited
by a cold trap and so could potentially provide a vehicle for
higher H-escape ﬂuxes. For example, high concentrations of
biogenic methane may have allowed for elevated H-escape
ﬂuxes on the early Earth (Catling et al. 2001). While we do
account for H escape from H2 produced by serpentinization
reactions (2FeO + H2O -> 2FeO1.5 + H2), these reactions are
only assumed to occur when liquid water is in contact with
newly produced crust (see Appendix A.5). Whether it
is
possible
amounts of
to continuously generate massive
molecular hydrogen via reactions between supercritical water
and rock is unknown. Reactions between supercritical water
and silicates are typically assumed to be kinetically limited by
sluggish solid-state diffusion and therefore negligible (Zolotov
et al. 1997). While there is some experimental evidence for
rapid oxidation of volcanic glass under wet, hot conditions
(Berger et al. 2019), it is difﬁcult to extrapolate these results to
planetary scales.

Another possible mechanism for H2 and CH4 generation is
via large impacts, which may transiently convert surface water
inventories to reduced gases via reactions with metallic and
ferrous iron impactor material (Zahnle et al. 2020). Future work
could investigate whether impact-induced water reduction is
sufﬁciently efﬁcient, and if the resulting CH4/H2 is sufﬁciently
to modify our conclusions on Venus’s escape
long-lived,
history.

A key limitation to the model used in this study is that it is
restricted to CO2–H2O-dominated atmospheres. The primordial
magma ocean atmosphere of Venus may have been predomi-
nantly CO and H2 rather than CO2 and H2O dominated (Sossi
et al. 2020). If this CO–H2 atmosphere was sufﬁciently long-
lived,
then Venus could have lost much of its hydrogen
inventory rapidly because molecular H2 is noncondensible.
One promising avenue for future work would be to model the
coevolution of CO2–CO–H2–H2O–CH4 atmospheres and the
including self-consistently calculating the
magma ocean,
thermal structure of the upper atmosphere, to better constrain
H-escape ﬂuxes during early evolution. While a more reducing
initial atmosphere would enhance early escape ﬂuxes, without
is unclear whether this scenario
such explicit modeling,
would remove the need for transient habitability. This is
because, as H abundances declined,
the resulting CO-
dominated atmosphere would provide a weak greenhouse
effect compared to CO2- and H2O-dominated atmospheres.
Once surface temperatures cooled below ∼900 K,
the
remaining hydrogen would react with CO to form water and
CO2 (Sossi et al. 2020), which would be subject to the same
cold-trap throttling as described above. Our calculations sample
initial water inventories as low as 2% of an Earth ocean, which
is a reasonable representation of a scenario whereby most
hydrogen is lost in a CO–H2 magma ocean atmosphere. And
yet even this comparatively modest residual water reservoir
cannot be completely lost to space without a transient-habitable
interval.

it

While transient habitability is favored when CO2-rich
atmospheres are assumed to throttle escape by cooling the
upper atmosphere (Section 3.2), greater retention of volatiles in
the mantle during magma ocean solidiﬁcation lowers the
number of transiently habitable model outputs (Section 4.1). In
particular, if ∼70% (Hier-Majumder & Hirschmann 2017) of
the initial water inventory is retained in the solid mantle, then
“habitable Venus” scenarios are more difﬁcult to attain (85%
less frequent) owing to late outgassing replenishment of H2O
that cannot be easily lost to space. It should be noted, however,
that our outgassing model
ignores
H-bearing sulfur species, and it does not allow for episodic
melt production or variable extrusive/intrusive melt emplace-
ment. A more realistic outgassing model could potentially
reconcile habitability and mantle volatile retention. When both
CO2 throttling of escape and substantial volatile retention are
assumed, virtually no model runs recover modern Venus,
whether transiently habitable or never habitable.

is highly simpliﬁed. It

Both nonhabitable and habitable scenarios tend to favor high
recent melt production, with roughly tens of km3 yr−1 being
typical values after 4.5 Gyr of evolution. Mean melt production
in the last 0.5 Gyr for habitable model outputs is 7–97 km3 yr−1
(95% conﬁdence) and 0–95 km3 yr−1 (95% conﬁdence) for
never-habitable model runs. Figure 8 shows the evolution of
melt production for a subset of never-habitable (top row) and
habitable (bottom row) nominal model runs that successfully
recover modern Venus. To illustrate how tectonic regime
evolution controls melt production, these have been decom-
posed into model runs where plate tectonics ended prior to 3.5
Ga (right column) and model runs where plate tectonics ended
after 1.5 Ga (left column). The transition from plate tectonics to
lid causes a transient decrease—and sometimes a
stagnant
temporary cessation—in melt production as mantle temperature
increases. While recent melt production is typically high,
still
negligible melt production in the last 0.5 Gyr
permissible, especially if plate tectonics ended recently
(Figures 8(a), (c)). Broadly speaking, high crustal production
rates are needed to remove leftover oxygen from recent water
loss, although modern melt production may be negligible in
model runs where oxygen was removed completely prior to
∼0.5 Ga. High melt production may not be reﬂected in modern
resurfacing rates, which are likely <2 km3 yr−1 (Head et al.
1991). Speciﬁcally, melt production could be largely intrusive
and/or episodic. Our habitable model outputs illustrate the self-
consistency of a scenario proposed by Way & Del Genio
(2020): recent habitability could have ended with enhanced
magmatic production that both caused recent resurfacing and
provided an oxygen sink for substantial amounts of O2.

is

there are several

In summary, while a habitable past is tentatively favored by
our model,
important caveats on this
conclusion that require further study. Additionally, this model
is agnostic on the dynamical plausibility of transitioning from a
post-accretion runaway greenhouse to the habitable, high-
albedo states modeled in GCMs (Way et al. 2016; Way & Del
Genio 2020). It should also be noted that of the ∼10% of
nominal model runs that successfully reproduce modern Venus,
around 9% are never habitable and only ∼1% experience
transient habitability. While this does not necessarily reﬂect the
relative probability of such scenarios because parameter ranges
for initial inventories are arbitrary and albedo feedbacks are
omitted, it does show that a degree of parameter tuning is
required for habitable Venus histories.

The red lines and shaded regions denote median outputs and 95% conﬁdence intervals, respectively. Panels (a) and (b) show never-habitable model outputs that
recover modern Venus, whereas panels (c) and (d) show habitable outputs that recover modern Venus. The left column denotes all model runs where the transition
from plate tectonics to stagnant lid occurred late, <1.5 Ga, and the right column denotes all model runs where the transition occurred early, >3.5 Ga. The transition
from plate tectonics to stagnant lid causes a temporary decrease in mantle production until the mantle heats up such that melting below the lid may resume. Melt
production for model runs when plate tectonics ended between 3.5 and 1.5 Ga are not shown but are intermediate to these two extremes.

4.4. Duration of Habitable Surface Conditions and Tectonic
Regime Transitions

If Venus was habitable in the past, our model constrains the
duration of that habitability to around 0.04–3.5 Gyr (95%
conﬁdence, median 1.9 Gyr), implying that Venus’s surface has
been uninhabitable since at
least 1.0 Ga. While broadly
consistent with purely climatological calculations that permit
surface habitability persisting until resurfacing around 0.7 Ga
(Way et al. 2016), this is not a tight constraint. The permitted
surface water
reservoir does inversely correlate with the
duration of habitability, however. Figure 9(a) shows the
maximum global ocean depth as a function of the duration of
surface habitability for model runs that successfully reproduce
modern Venus, as well as a sample of “failed” model runs that
do not recover modern pCO2, pO2, and pH2O. Deep global
oceans (∼km) are only permitted if habitability is lost within
the ﬁrst Gyr, when solar XUV ﬂuxes were comparatively high.
The only conditions under which habitability persisted until
more recently are for global ocean depths of ∼100 m. This is
because recent habitability with large surface reservoirs makes
it difﬁcult to subsequently remove water and oxygen to recover
the modern atmosphere. Removing water is typically more

difﬁcult than removing oxygen. Indeed, many “failed Venus”
model outputs resume a magma ocean phase when they reenter
runaway greenhouse, thereby removing all molecular oxygen
via reactions with the molten surface. But these planets are
unable to lose the large amounts of water required to induce a
second magma ocean.

ratio as a function of

Model outputs also provide crude constraints on the
tectonic history of Venus. Figure 9(b) shows the modern
40Ar(atmosphere)/40Ar(total)
the
transition time between plate tectonics and a stagnant lid
regime. The actual ratio, using observed 40Ar(atmosphere) =
1.6 × 1016 kg, is overplotted for comparison. The best ﬁt to
observed 40Ar is achieved if Venus experienced at
least
0.5 Gyr of plate tectonics before transitioning to a stagnant
lid regime. This is because an early stagnant ensures high
early mantle temperatures and larger integrated melt produc-
tion over Venus’s history. However, our mantle convection
model uses simple parameterizations for plate tectonics
and stagnant lid regimes that may not necessarily capture
episodic bursts of melt production. Coupling more compre-
hensive mantle convection models (e.g., Noack et al. 2012;

shows peak global ocean depth as a function of the duration of habitable surface conditions. Recent habitability (in the last ∼2 Gyr) is only compatible with shallow
global oceans owing to limits to subsequent water loss. Panel (b) shows the atmospheric 40Ar relative to total 40Ar after 4.5 Gyr compared to the transition time

Gillmann et al. 2020) to planetary climate–redox evolution is
one possible avenue for future work.

4.5. Implications for Future Venus Missions

Future in situ observations could resolve whether Venus was
ever habitable. Atmospheric measurements of Xe and Kr
isotopic inventories by the upcoming DAVINCI mission
(Garvin et al. 2020) will better constrain the escape history

of Venus and, by extension,
inform understanding of past
climate evolution (Baines et al. 2013; Kane et al. 2019; Zahnle
et al. 2019). DAVINCI is also expected to provide more precise
constraints on bulk atmospheric D/H (Garvin et al. 2020). One
promising avenue for future modeling efforts is to incorporate
realistic models of D/H fractionation (under different escape
regimes and atmospheric compositions)
into whole-planet
geochemical evolution models such as PACMAN that include

15

The Planetary Science Journal, 2:216 (27pp), 2021 October

Krissansen-Totton, Fortney, & Nimmo

deep volatile cycling and exogeneous supply. Such modeling
efforts will be necessary to interpret improved D/H constraints.
Among the nominal model outputs that experienced a
(Figure 3), globally averaged ocean depth
habitable past
peaked at around 100 m. While it is difﬁcult to predict ocean
cation and anion abundances owing to unknown contributions
from weathering, hydrothermal, and clay-forming processes, if
an Earth-like ocean composition is assumed for illustrative
purposes, then our model predicts evaporite deposits of around
∼1018kg halite (∼1 m global equivalent layer thickness) and
∼1017 kg anhydrite (∼0.1 m global equivalent layer thickness).
Peak surface temperature during and after ocean evaporation is
typically <800 K (81% of habitable model outputs), which is
below the melting points of both halite and anhydrite
(Schoﬁeld et al. 2014). Calcite deposits are not stable with
respect to sulfatization under modern surface conditions, and
they are also more likely to volatilize during metamorphic
heating (Zolotov 2019). However, the possibility of calcite
deposits beneath impermeable strata cannot be excluded. While
assuming that all dissolved cations and anions ultimately form
evaporites during ocean evaporation is an oversimpliﬁcation,
the size of the predicted deposits is potentially comparable to
that of Earth’s evaporites (Warren 2010) and so could be
accessible to remote sensing via NIR imaging by the upcoming
VERITAS (Smrekar et al. 2020) and EnVision (Widemann
et al. 2020) missions. Surface regions conjectured to have
survived resurfacing, such as tessera terrain (Hansen &
López 2010), are promising locations to search for evaporite
deposits and other evidence of hydration.

5. Conclusions
1. A coupled mode of Venus’s atmosphere–interior–climate
evolution implies that both habitable and never-habitable
histories are consistent with modern constraints. Both
scenarios can reproduce a dense CO2-dominated modern
atmosphere with negligible water vapor and oxygen and
reasonable abundances of outgassed 40Ar and 4He. Which
of these histories was realized depends on cloud albedo
feedbacks.

2. Habitable past scenarios are favored if CO2-rich atmo-
spheres radiatively cool the mesosphere. This is because
in nonhabitable

to obtain a modern
scenarios, and so it

vapor. Habitable histories
temporarily sequestering CO2 in carbonates,
thereby
permitting elevated H2O escape when their atmospheres
reenter moist-to-runaway greenhouse phases before
degassed CO2 is returned to the atmosphere.

3. On the other hand, habitable Venus outcomes are less
frequent when volatiles are assumed to be mostly retained
in the solid mantle during magma ocean solidiﬁcation.
This is because water recently outgassed cannot be easily
lost to space rapidly enough to explain the observed low
H2O abundance.

4. In our habitable past scenarios, Venus’s surface was
temperate for 0.04–3.5 Gyr (95% conﬁdence), during
which time the global ocean depth may have been a
few hundred meters. Assuming plausible ocean cation
abundances, a surface ocean of this size ought to have left
behind sizable evaporite deposits accessible to future
observations.

the same approach as that described in Krissansen-Totton et al.

because this is approximately the maximum core heat ﬂow
consistent with the absence of a dynamo assuming no inner
core nucleation (Driscoll & Bercovici 2014; Nimmo 2015). We
do not consider uncertainty in core heat ﬂow because we are
already incorporating a large factor of four range in radiogenic
mantle heat production.

is
speciﬁed by the following equation:

Here Racrit = 1100 is the critical Rayleigh number, k = 4.2
W m−1 K−1 is the thermal conductivity of silicates, β = 1/3,
and Tp and Tsurf are mantle potential temperature and mean
surface temperature, respectively. The Rayleigh number, Ra, is
given by

Here the Frank–Kamenetskii parameter θ = 300,000 × (Tp −
2), whereas the internal Rayleigh number, Ra,
Tsurf)/(8.314 × Tp
is unchanged from plate tectonics regime. Melt production
under the stagnant lid regime is calculated assuming cylindrical
upwelling (Foley & Smye 2018):

in
Krissansen-Totton et al. (2021)—ensures dynamic viscosities
ranging from 1020 to 1022 Pa s for Earth-like mantle potential
temperatures around 1600 K but smoothly transitions to
magma ocean appropriate dynamic viscosities (<1 Pa s)
above ∼ 1900 K (see Krissansen-Totton et al. 2021,
their
Figure A3). The length scale of convection, dconvect, depends
on whether a magma ocean is present:

Here the convective velocity is assumed to be vconvect =
0.05κ(Ra/θ)2/3/dconv (Foley & Smye 2018), whereas the
melting depth, dmelt,
is now the depth at which mantle
temperature intersects the solidus. This expression arises by
considering the volumetric ﬂow of upwelling melt out of a
convective cylinder between the melting depth and the base of
the lid. By analogy with Earth mantle convection, we assume
the horizontal length of convective cells to be 0.45rp, which
gives rise to the factor of 17.8 (Foley & Smye 2018). Average
melt fraction, y¯ , is the volume-weighted melt fraction from the
melting depth to the base of the stagnant
lid, which has
thickness, δ (m):

The expressions for the solidus and liquidus are described in
Krissansen-Totton et al. (2021) but are derived from linear ﬁts
to the solidus for low-pressure dry peridotite and high-pressure
lower mantle (Hirschmann 2000; Schaefer et al. 2016).
Following Schaefer et al. (2016), the liquidus is assumed to
be 600 K warmer than the solidus at all pressures. We also
allow for modulation of the solidus and liquidus by the pressure
overburden of surface volatiles. Here Poverburden is the pressure
from all H2O (liquid and gaseous), CO2, and O2 at the surface.
There is a separate dependence on solid-body radius, r, to add
pressure overburden from overlying silicate material.

The time evolution of lid thickness is given by the following

zero, the ﬁrst term in both Equations (23) and (24) equals zero

A.3. Modeling 40Ar Atmospheric Evolution
The 40Ar–40K system is modeled by explicitly tracking the
time evolution of 40K in the mantle, 40Kmantle, and lid, 40Klid
(during stagnant lid), as well as its decay to mantle argon,
40Armantle, and the accumulation of 40Ar in the atmosphere,
40Aratmo. Our approach follows that described in O’Rourke &
Korenaga (2015). While plate tectonics is operating, the time
evolution of each reservoir is given by the following system of
equations:

The terms jmantle and jcrust denote the proportions of
radionuclides partitioned into the mantle and crust, respec-
tively. Initially, all radionuclides reside in the mantle, but once
a stagnant lid begins to form, they evolve according to the

Here λAr = 0.0581 Gyr−1 and λCa = 0.4862 Gyr−1 are decay
constants for the decay of 40K to 40Ar and 40Ca, respectively,
and Mmantle is the mass of the mantle. Mantle 40Ar is transferred
to the atmosphere via magmatic production.

described below.

Here DK = 1 is

potassium (O’Rourke & Korenaga 2015). Terms involving
melt fraction equal zero when no melt is being produced.
Mantle 40Ar is transferred to the atmosphere via magmatic
production, whereas the decay of 40K in the lid is assumed to
instantaneously add 40Ar to the atmosphere (O’Rourke &
Korenaga 2015), which may result in somewhat overestimat-
ing atmospheric 40Ar, and perhaps explains why our median
model estimate for modern 40Ar is larger than the observed
atmospheric abundance (Figures 2(k) and 3(k)). We are
additionally assuming that all argon in the mantle-derived
source rock partitions into the melt. 40K in the mantle and lid
are exchanged as the depth of the lithosphere evolves.

A.4. Modeling 4He Atmospheric Evolution

A similar approach is adopted to calculate the accumulation
of 4He, except in the case of helium, where it is generated via
the decay of 235U, 238U, and 232Th, and so it is necessary to
explicitly track the evolution of all three species in the mantle
and the stagnant

framework of Namiki & Solomon (1998). While plate tectonics

The escape ﬂux of He during all
is
approximated using the same parameterization, with ﬁrst-order
dependence on the solar XUV ﬂux and atmospheric abundance
(Namiki & Solomon 1998). The ﬂux is scaled to match the
observed modern escape rate of helium of 9.6 × 105 kg yr−1
(Prather & McElroy 1983; Krasnopolsky & Gladstone 2005):

The modern helium abundance assumed for this scaling law is
taken to be 10 ppm (Krasnopolsky & Gladstone 2005).
However, it should be noted that this is an extrapolation to
the mid-lower atmosphere, and the dependence of helium
escape ﬂuxes on XUV ﬂuxes is likely more complex and
than Equation (48) suggests. Our
composition dependent
helium calculations should be taken as crude approximations
to Venus’s atmospheric helium abundance evolution.

A.5. Stagnant Lid Volatile Cycling

The cycling of oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide between
the atmosphere and the mantle under plate tectonics is
described in Krissansen-Totton et al. (2021). The following
changes were made to accommodate volatile cycling under a
stagnant lid regime.

Here frhydr-frac = 10−3–0.03 (sampled uniformly in log space) is
the unknown efﬁciency of hydration reactions. We are
assuming that, at most, hydrated crust is 3% water by mass
(Schaefer & Sasselov 2015). We assume a linear dependence
on ocean depth for as long as there is emerged land, then no
ocean depth dependence beyond this. Additionally, we assume
that the return of water to the interior tapers off as the water

Here 973 K is the maximum surface temperature for serpentine

hydration occurs below the crust, it is also helpful to deﬁne the
fractional depth of hydration as the ratio of the hydration depth
to the crustal depth, or 1.0 (whichever
is smaller). The

A.6. Escape Parameterizations

The atmospheric escape parameterizations adopted in
Krissansen-Totton et al. (2021) were chosen to minimize
nonbiological oxygen accumulation. In the diffusion limit, H
escape was limited by the diffusion of water
through a
noncondensible background gas (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert
2013). In this study, we instead assume that eddy diffusion
dominates vertical transport at altitudes where water is more
abundant than atomic H and O (Catling & Kasting 2017), and
so escape of hydrogen is limited by the diffusion of atomic
hydrogen through the background atmosphere:

Here bi−j (mol m−1 s−1) is the binary diffusion coefﬁcient of
the ith species through the jth species (Marrero & Mason 1972;
Zahnle & Kasting 1986). These are weighted by the strato-
spheric mixing ratios of each noncondensible constituent (CO2,
N2, and atomic O), which are obtained from the atmospheric
proﬁle calculations and from assuming that all water
is
dissociated. The scale heights of hydrogen, HH (m), and of
the background gases, Hn (m), depend on upper atmosphere
temperature, Tmeso (see main text). The hydrogen mixing ratio
in the upper atmosphere, fH, is assumed to be double the upper
atmosphere water mixing ratio,
. The diffusion-limited
escape ﬂux is jdiff (mol H m−2 s−1). Note that this diffusion
limit only applies in the low H abundance regime and that
escape is XUV limited for H-rich upper atmospheres
(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2021).

Sensitivity Tests

B.1. Sensitivity of Results to Ion Escape and Melt Depletion

The ion escape sensitivity test described in the main text is
shown in Figure B1. In our nominal model, the silicate solidus
and liquidus depend on pressure but are independent of
composition. This is reasonable under plate tectonics, whereby
oceanic crust is assumed to be completely recycled into the
mantle. However, under a stagnant lid regime, melt accumula-
tion in the lid may progressively deplete the mantle, resulting in
an increasing solidus. Melt production, and therefore oxygen
sinks, may subsequently decline over time. To test the impact
of mantle depletion, we repeated our calculations allowing for

Figure B1. All habitable past model outputs from a sensitivity test where we allow for nonthermal escape of O+ ions using estimates from Kulikov et al. (2006) (case
2b). Model outputs are largely the same as those in Figure 3 in the main text. Note that O+ loss is potentially very large within the ﬁrst <1 Gyr but is negligible
subsequently, and so it does not affect late oxygen drawdown and the duration of habitability.

the evolution of the solidus with melt extraction from the
mantle. During plate tectonics (or magma ocean), the solidus
was assumed to remain constant, but under stagnant lid the
solidus evolves as follows:

Here MP is melt production as deﬁned by Equation (14),
Vmantle is the volume of the mantle, y¯ is the mean melt fraction
as deﬁned by Equation (15), and the liquidus is assumed to
remain constant. Results from including mantle depletion are
shown in Figures B2 and B3 and described in the main text.

B.2. Sensitivity of Results to Volatile Retention in
Mantle and Initial Mantle Redox

To investigate the sensitivity of our results to greater mantle
volatile retention during magma ocean solidiﬁcation, we
repeated nominal calculations accounting for melt compaction
in the freezing front. Following Hier-Majumder & Hirschmann
(2017), we used the following expression to determine the melt
fraction trapped in the mantle as the solidiﬁcation front moves
toward the surface, fTL:

sedimentation and ∼10 km freezing front (Hier-Majumder &
Hirschmann 2017). Rapid magma ocean solidiﬁcation (i.e., a
large rate of change in mantle potential temperature) results in
greater volatile retention. Additionally, we require that fTL is
bounded below by 0 (negative trapped melt fractions are
unphysical) and above by 0.3 (retained melt fraction does not
exceed disaggregation melt fraction). The trapped melt fraction
is incorporated into the system of equations governing water
and carbon dioxide reservoir evolution by modifying Equation
(S16) in Krissansen-Totton et al. (2021):

both a trapped melt fraction ( fTL) and solid-melt equilibrium
partitioning (kH O2

growing solid silicate interior. Results from including volatile
retention are shown in Figures B4 and B5 and described in the
