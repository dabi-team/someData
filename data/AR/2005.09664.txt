ABSTRACT

Despite their importance, a detailed understanding of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains elusive. X-ray
measurements of the element distributions in supernova remnants (SNRs) offer important clues for understand-
ing the explosion and nucleosynthesis mechanisms for SNe Ia. However, it is challenging to observe the entire
ejecta mass in X-rays for young SNRs, because the central ejecta may not have been heated by the reverse shock
yet. Here we present over 200 kilosecond Chandra observations of the Type Ia SNR G344.7–0.1, whose age is
old enough for the reverse shock to have reached the SNR center, providing an opportunity to investigate the
distribution of the entire ejecta mass. We reveal a clear stratiﬁcation of heavy elements with a centrally peaked
distribution of the Fe ejecta surrounded by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs: Si, S, Ar Ca) with an arc-like
structure. The centroid energy of the Fe K emission is marginally lower in the central Fe-rich region than in
the outer IME-rich regions, suggesting that the Fe ejecta were shock-heated more recently. These results are
consistent with the prediction for standard SN Ia models, where the heavier elements are synthesized in the
interior of an exploding white dwarf. We ﬁnd, however, that the peak location of the Fe K emission is slightly
offset to the west with respect to the geometric center of the SNR. This apparent asymmetry is likely due to
the inhomogeneous density distribution of the ambient medium, consistent with our radio observations of the
ambient molecular and neutral gas.

1. INTRODUCTION

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thought to result from
thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in a binary sys-
tem. Since the peak luminosity in the optical band is al-
most uniform among the objects, SNe Ia can be utilized
as distance indicators in cosmology (e.g., Riess et al. 1998;
Perlmutter et al. 1998). SNe Ia also play an important role
as major suppliers of iron, contributing to the chemical en-
richment of the Milky Way (e.g., Reddy et al. 2006) and
galaxy clusters (e.g., Sato et al. 2007). Despite this impor-

tance, however, many fundamental aspects of these explo-
sions remain elusive.

X-ray observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) offer a
unique way to address the relevant open questions, as they al-
low us to measure the composition and distribution of heavy
elements that were synthesized during the SN explosion. In
fact, recent observational studies of young, luminous Type
Ia SNRs, such as Kepler, Tycho, and SN 1006, have pro-
vided important insights into the evolution of the explosions
of their progenitors (e.g., Vink 2017; Decourchelle 2017;
Katsuda 2017, and references therein). In these young his-

torical SNRs, however, the central ejecta might not yet have
been heated by the reverse shock and thus are invisible in
X-rays. Thus, while some extensive studies have been per-
formed with these young Ia SNRs, our knowledge of how
the SN Ia explosion begins or what happens in the deepest
layers of the exploding white dwarf is still limited.
The Type Ia SNR G344.7–0.1 is an ideal

target for
a comprehensive X-ray ejecta study of SN Ia, because
its age is signiﬁcantly older (3–6 kyr: Combi et al. 2010;
Giacani et al. 2011) than the historical Ia SNRs, for which
the reverse shock has likely reached the SNR center. This
SNR was discovered in the radio band with the Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) and the Parkes
Observatory (Clark et al. 1975). X-rays from this region
were ﬁrst detected by the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey
(Sugizaki et al. 2001), and identiﬁed as emission originat-
ing from an optically thin thermal plasma associated with
the SNR (Yamauchi et al. 2005). The following studies
with Chandra and XMM-Newton enabled more detailed
imaging and spectroscopic analysis, where the abovemen-
tioned SNR ionization age was estimated (Combi et al. 2010;
Giacani et al. 2011). G344.7–0.1 was initially classiﬁed as a
core-collapse (CC) SNR, based on its highly asymmetric X-
ray morphology (Lopez et al. 2011) and possible association
with star forming regions (Giacani et al. 2011). However,
elemental abundances of the SN ejecta were not well con-
strained in these studies, mainly due to the short exposure,
∼ 25 ks for both Chandra and XMM-Newton.

The situation was largely changed by Suzaku observations,
where strong, ejecta-dominated Fe K emission was detected
(Yamaguchi et al. 2012). Its centroid energy ∼ 6.46 keV cor-
responds to a relatively low ionization state (Fe17+), which
is proposed to be a common characteristic for Type Ia SNRs
(Yamaguchi et al. 2014a). Notably, the atomic processes in-
volved in the Fe K ﬂuorescence emission are theoretically
well understood (e.g., Yamaguchi et al. 2014b). Thus, the
detection of the Fe K emission from this SNR is a remark-
able advantage compared to other Type Ia SNRs (with sim-

ilar ages of several kyr, e.g., G299.2–2.9: Post et al. 2014;
DEM L71: Hughes et al. 2003), where the X-ray spectra
are dominated by Fe L-shell emission with highly uncer-
tain atomic physics. Unfortunately, the angular resolution
of Suzaku was not good enough to constrain the detailed dis-
tribution of the Fe ejecta in G344.7–0.1. This motivated us
to carry out deep Chandra observations to reveal the distri-
bution of the entire SN ejecta mass, including Fe, the major
nucleosynthesis product of SNe Ia.

It should also be noted that the previous Chandra obser-
vation detected a point-like source in the soft X-ray band,
named CXOU J170357.8–414302, at the geometrical center
of G344.7–0.1 (Combi et al. 2010). Since the absorption col-
umn density of this source (NH ≈ 1 × 1022 cm−2) was sig-
niﬁcantly lower than that of the SNR (5 × 1022 cm−2), it was
concluded in their work that the source was a foreground ob-
ject unassociated with the SNR. However, one may still sus-
pect the possibility of a central compact object (CCO) orig-
inating from a CC progenitor, because of the poor photon
statistics from the previous observation. Our additional 200
ks Chandra observations also allow us to conﬁrm that this
object is unrelated to G344.7–0.1 with better statistics and to
search for other point-like sources near the SNR center.

tion 4 and present our conclusions in Section 5. The errors
quoted in this work are at 1σ conﬁdence level, unless other-
wise stated.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

We used the ACIS-I array (Garmire et al. 2003) for our
deep observations of G344.7–0.1 to cover the whole X-ray
emitting region (∼ 8′ in diameter) within a single ﬁeld of
view (FoV). The ACIS-I has a lower background level than
the S3 chip, especially at energies above 5 keV, offering a
great advantage for our primary objective: detection and lo-
calization of the Fe K emission.

are combined (see the text for the details). The green squares indi-

2018 July. The black circles labeled 1 and 2 indicate the on-axis aim
points of the former and latter observations, respectively. The red

blue contours are the 843 MHz radio image of G344.7–0.1 taken

As summarized in Table 1, the observations were split into
two series, one in May and the other in 2018 July, with the
exposure totaling ∼ 205 ks. Our quick-look analysis after the
ﬁrst observations series revealed that the Fe K emission par-
tially fell into the gaps between the ACIS-I CCDs, where
the exposure is reduced as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, we
slightly shifted the aim point for the later observation series
such that the Fe-rich regions received the maximum expo-
sure. The difference in the aim points and roll angles between
the two series is indicated in Figure 1 with the integrated ex-
posure map overplotted with the radio intensity contours of
the SNR.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1. Imaging Analysis

3.1.1. Extended Emission

Figure 2(a) shows a three-color, exposure-corrected im-
age of G344.7–0.1, where red, green, and blue correspond
to emission from the Si K (1.76–1.94 keV), hard contin-
uum (3.0–6.0 keV), and Fe K (6.35–6.55 keV) band, respec-
tively. The image indicates that the softer X-ray emission
(red) spreads across the entire SNR, whereas the hard X-ray
continuum (green) is relatively faint in the northeast region,
implying a temperature gradient from the southwest (high) to
the northeast (low). This gradient is more clearly highlighted
in Figure 2(b), a map of the mean energy of the detected pho-
tons in the broad energy band of 1.5–5.0 keV generated using
the mean energy map script in the CIAO package.1 Note,
however, that this energy band includes several emission
lines, and thus a more quantitative spectral analysis (§3.2) is
required to determine the accurate temperature distribution.
Figures 2(c) and (d) are the narrowband images of the Si
K and Fe K emission, identical to the red and blue images in
Figure 2(a) respectively. It is remarkable that the Fe K line-
enhanced region is surrounded by the arc-like structure of the
Si K emission. Also notable is that the Fe K peak location is
about 2′ offset to the west with respect to the geometric cen-
ter of the SNR determined by the radio band image. In ad-
dition to the arc of the Si K emission, a ﬁlamentary structure
is found at the west rim in the same energy band, indicated
with the dashed ellipse in Figure 2(c). All of these features
are discovered in this work for the ﬁrst time, owing to the
deep observations with the Chandra ACIS-I.

We generate in Figure 3 radial proﬁles of the surface
brightness in the narrow energy bands that correspond to the
K-shell emission of Si (1.76–1.94 keV), S (2.25–2.60 keV),
Ar (2.95–3.25 keV), Ca (3.60–4.10 keV), and Fe (6.35–
6.55 keV). We conﬁrm that the Fe K emission proﬁle indeed
peaks at the interior to other species. We also ﬁnd that the
proﬁles of the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) are simi-
lar to each other.

3.1.2. Detected Point-like Sources

gion as the other panels of Figure 2. Because of the

Yamauchi et al. 2005; Combi et al. 2010; Giacani et al. 2011;
Yamaguchi et al. 2012), soft X-rays from G344.7–0.1 are al-
most fully absorbed. Therefore, photons in this energy band
are likely dominated by foreground objects. Our simple
eyeball inspection detects the two bright point-like sources,
labeled No. 1 and 2 in Figure 2(e). Source No. 1 corre-
sponds to CXOU J170357.8–414302, previously reported by
Combi et al. (2010). This source is located near the geo-
metric center of the SNR, and does not positionally coincide
with the Fe K peak location. The other (No. 2) is newly de-
tected with our deep Chandra observation. We also search for
fainter point sources using the wavdetect algorithm in the
two energy ranges of 0.5–1.2 keV and 1.2–2.5 keV with the
Encircled Counts Fraction (ECF) parameter set to 0.9. Ta-

3.2. Spectral Analysis

3.2.1. Extended Emission

Here we analyze ACIS-I spectra extracted from the re-
gions given in Figure 2, where the point sources detected in
the previous section (Table 2) are excluded.
In our analy-
sis we model the background emission instead of subtracting
it. Figure 4 shows the spectra of several representative re-
gions, where black and red are the data from the May and
July observations, respectively. The emission lines of the
IMEs and Fe are clearly resolved in each region. Background
data are extracted from an annulus region surrounding the
SNR with inner and outer radii of 5′.0 and 7′.0, respectively
(Figure 1). We model and ﬁt the background spectra simulta-

neously with the source spectra, instead of subtracting them
from the source data, to properly take into account the differ-
ence in the effective area between the source and background
regions. The details of the background spectral modeling are
presented in Appendix A. In the following spectral analysis,
we ﬁt unbinned data using the C-statistics (Cash 1979) to es-
timate the model parameters and their error ranges without
bias, although the binned spectra are shown in the ﬁgures for
clarity.

We ﬁrst ﬁt the spectra with a model of an optically thin
thermal plasma in the non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) state,
i.e., the vnei model in the XSPEC package, based on the
latest atomic database (AtomDB2 version 3.0.9). We use the

tbnew gas model 3 for the foreground absorption, assum-
ing the photoelectric absorption cross sections taken from
Verner et al. (1996). The free parameters are the absorp-
tion column density NH, electron temperature kTe, ioniza-
tion timescale net, volume emission measure (VEM), and
elemental abundances of Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe relative to
the solar abundance table of Wilms et al. (2000). This model
gives good ﬁts to the spectra below 5 keV, but fails to re-
produce the Fe K emission. We ﬁnd that the model gen-
erally predicts an Fe K centroid energy higher than the ob-
served values, which indicates that the Fe K emission orig-
inates from another plasma component with a lower ioniza-
tion state.

We thus add a Gaussian component to reproduce the K-
shell emission from the low-ionized Fe. The addition of
this component signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁt, with the C-stat
value reduced from 1003.00/805 to 920.43/803 in the 5.0–
8.0 keV band, including the strong Fe K line. The best-ﬁt
model spectra and parameters are given in Figure 4 and Ta-
ble 3, respectively. The abundances of the IMEs (but for Mg)
are generally higher than the solar values, implying a signif-
icant ejecta contribution to the vnei component. We also

3 https://pulsar.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/wilms/research/tbabs/

ﬁnd that both the electron temperature (of the vnei compo-
nent) and the Fe K centroid energy vary among the regions.
The lowest temperature is observed in the N and NE, con-
sistent with the mean photon energy map (Figure 2b). The
Fe K centroid energy is marginally lower in the Fe peak re-
gion than in most of the outer regions, indicating that the
Fe ejecta in the former has a low ionization degree. The
absorption column density is found to be almost uniform
throughout the SNR, ∼ 6.5 × 1022 cm−2. This value is
slightly higher than the previous measurements of NH =
4.0–5.5 ×1022 cm−2 (Yamauchi et al. 2005; Combi et al.
2010; Giacani et al. 2011; Yamaguchi et al. 2012). This dis-
crepancy is likely due to the difference in the reference solar
abundance; the previous work referred to Anders & Grevesse

(1989), while we refer to Wilms et al. (2000).
we ﬁt the ACIS-I spectra using the solar abundance ta-
ble of Anders & Grevesse (1989), we obtain NH ∼ 4.5 ×
1022 cm−2, consistent with the previous work.

Next, we replace the Gaussian component with another
vnei component to account for the emission from pure Fe
ejecta. The SNR is now divided into three regions, the Fe
peak, Si-arc (containing Si E, N, and SW), and rim (con-
taining N, NE, NW, SE, S, and Filament), and their spectra
are jointly ﬁtted with a common NH value. Table 4 gives
the parameter values obtained for the pure Fe ejecta com-

3.2.2. Point-like Sources

We perform spectral analysis of two bright sources (No. 1
and No. 2) detected in the soft X-ray band, both embed-
ded in the diffuse emission from the SNR (Figure 2e). The
spectra of source No. 1 (CXOU J170357.8–414302) and
No. 2 are shown in Figure 5. We ﬁt the spectra of both
sources with the following three models: an absorbed power
law (tbnew gas × powerlaw), an absorbed blackbody
(tbnew gas × bbody), and an absorbed optically thin
thermal plasma with the solar abundances (tbnew gas ×
apec). We use background spectra extracted from the annu-
lus surrounding each source region. For source No. 1, we ob-
tain 160 counts for the background-corrected spectrum with
16% background contribution, and 136 counts with 8.6% for
No. 2. The best-ﬁt parameters we obtain are given in Table 5.
The estimated column densities are signiﬁcantly lower than
that of the SNR (NH ≈ 6.5 × 1022 cm−2) for any model
assumption, consistent with the foreground stellar object ex-
planation as suggested by Combi et al. (2010) for No. 1. The
spectra of the other detected sources (Table 2) with sufﬁcient

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Stratiﬁed Elemental Composition

Thanks to the deep observations with Chandra, we have
revealed the centrally peaked Fe K emission surrounded by
the arc-like structure of the IME emission. This radially
stratiﬁed chemical composition with Fe at the interior is
consistent with the standard picture of SN Ia nucleosynthe-
sis dominated by the carbon detonation (e.g. Iwamoto et al.
1999; Seitenzahl et al. 2013). Several other SN Ia explo-
sion models, such as those involving pure carbon deﬂagration
(e.g. Fink et al. 2014) or He-shell detonation (e.g. Sim et al.
2012), predict a substantial amount of 56Ni (which decays
into Fe) synthesized outside of the IME. We do not ﬁnd such
evidence in the X-ray data of G344.7–0.1, which may rule
out these explosion scenarios as the origin of this SNR. We
note that our spectral data below 1 keV, where Fe L lines fall,

 
 
 
 
ELEMENT STRATIFICATION IN SNR G344.7–0.1

are missing due to the strong absorption, leaving the possibil-
ity that a signiﬁcant amount of Fe is mixing into the IME-rich
layer. Unless this is the case, our results prefer the carbon
detonation model for the origin of G344.7–0.1.

We have also found that the peak location of the Fe emis-
sion (and thus the centroid of the IME arc) is offset to the
west by ∼ 1′.6 (corresponding to ∼ 2.8 pc at the distance of
6 kpc) with respect to the geometric center of the SNR. This
implies that either the SN explosion was asymmetric, or the
Fe K peak location is the actual explosion center but an ap-
parent asymmetry has formed during the SNR evolution. The
spatial distribution of the plasma conditions may help dis-
entangle this degeneracy. In particular, the ionization state
of the Fe ejecta that is inferred from the Fe K centroid en-
ergy offers a useful diagnostic of the time duration since the
ejecta were heated by the reverse shock (e.g. Badenes et al.
2006; Yamaguchi et al. 2014b). Figure 6(a) shows the Fe K
centroid energy observed in each region as a function of the
angular distance from the location of the Fe emission, which
reveals a positive correlation between the two quantities. The
mean values of the centroid energy in the Fe peak and Si arc
regions correspond to the charge states of Fe10+ and Fe17+,
respectively. Similarly, Table 4 indicates that a lower ioniza-
tion timescale is achieved in the Fe peak region than in the
outer regions. This suggests that the Fe ejecta at the inner
regions were heated by the reverse shock more recently. We
also plot in Figure 6(b) the electron temperatures of the NEI
component of each region. In contrast to the Fe K centroid,
the temperature is anticorrelated with the distance from the
Fe peak location. We thus conclude that the location of the
Fe peak region is the true explosion center of this SNR. The
origin of the asymmetric morphology is discussed in more
detail in §4.2.

One caveat is that the variation in the Fe K centroids may
also be contributed by the line-of-sight velocity of the Fe
ejecta, as was claimed for the Kepler SNR (Kasuga et al.
2018). We ﬁnd that the observed variation in the Fe K
centroid (∼50 eV) requires a line-of-sight velocity vsight of
2400 km s−1 for the Fe ejecta at the Fe peak region. If the
Fe ejecta of the Fe peak location have been freely expand-
ing for 3000 yr with vsight ∼2400 km s−1, the ejecta reach
7.4 pc from the SN explosion center, larger than the radius
of this SNR (5 pc; assuming a distance of 6 kpc). Given that
the ejecta must have been decelerated by the reverse shock,
we should take this estimate as a lower limit. Since an un-
naturally large asymmetry in the explosion is required to ex-
plain this line shift solely with the Doppler effect, the ioniza-
tion effect is likely to be dominant in the observed variation
in the Fe K centroid energies. The degeneracy between the
ionization effect and Doppler shift in the Fe K emission can
be disentangled by measurement of the Fe Kβ/Kα ﬂux ratio
that strongly depends on the dominant charge state and thus

constrains the rest-frame Fe K centroid (Yamaguchi et al.
2014a). Unfortunately, neither our Chandra observation nor
any previous work allows us to detect Fe Kβ emission due
to poor photon statistics and limited energy resolution. Fu-
ture high-resolution spectroscopy with XRISM and Athena
are crucial to determine both charge state and line-of-sight
velocity accurately.

Now we estimate the three-dimensional distribution of the
vnei component that is dominated by the IME ejecta, as-
suming that the Fe peak region is the true explosion cen-
ter. Since the surface-brightness proﬁles of Si, S, Ar, and Ca
(Figure 3) are virtually identical with one another, we use a
radial proﬁle of the 1.5–5.0 keV emission as representative of
the IME distribution. Figure 7(a) shows the extracted radial
proﬁle compared with a simple two-zone spherical model as-
suming a uniform density and uniform abundance distribu-
tion in each zone. We also take into account the tempera-
ture gradient, and thus the emissivity variation, between the
two zones, where ∼ 1.1 keV at < 1′ and ∼ 0.9 keV at 1′–3′.
Figure 7(b) shows the continuum-subtracted surface bright-
ness of the Fe K and 1.5–5.0-keV emission, suggesting an

high-density shell with inner and outer radii of 1

served proﬁle is well reproduced by a model schematized in
Figure 7(c): a low-density (nin) inner sphere with a radius of
1′ and a thick high-density (nshell = 2.6nin) shell with inner
and outer radii of 1′ and 3′, respectively. The IME arc struc-
ture found in Figure 2(c) corresponds to the inner part of the
thick shell, where the highest surface brightness is achieved.

and the west rim is ∼ 3′, and thus the excess in the brightness

established Type Ia SNRs, such as Kepler. We note that the
surface-brightness-weighted geometric center, i.e. the aper-
ture center for the PRM, is (αJ2000, δJ2000)=(17h03m55s.5,
–41◦42′54′′.5), which is almost the same as the geomet-
ric center of the SNR, and thus is offset from our pro-
posed explosion center of (αJ2000, δJ2000)=(17h03m49s.1,
–41◦42′46′′.0). This offset and apparent asymmetry seems
to be caused by the nonuniform distribution of the ambient

medium distributions (e.g., Kepler, N103B) also show high
asymmetric morphology and off-center aperture center like
G344.7–0.1 (Lopez et al. 2011).

4.2. Asymmetry

As discussed in the previous section, the identiﬁed explo-
sion center is offset from the geometric center of the SNR.
Therefore, the X-ray morphology of G344.7–0.1 is relatively
asymmetric. Lopez et al. (2011) classiﬁed this SNR as a pos-
sible CC SNR because of such highly asymmetric X-ray mor-
phology, based on the analysis of the power-ratio method
(PRM). However, the dataset used in Lopez et al. (2011) has
more limited photon statistics than our 200 ks Chandra data.
Thus, we apply the PRM on our new dataset of G344.7–0.1
to measure the asymmetry of this SNR. We replicate the anal-
ysis from Lopez et al. (2011), where the PRs are calculated
on the 0.5–2.1 keV band exposure-corrected image of SNR,
and obtain P2/P0 = 9.84+2.05
4. The
values are now comparable with those for the other well-

−2.32, P3/P0 = 1.75+0.55
−0.62

4 High P2/P0 indicates elliptical or elongated morphology, and high
P3/P0 indicates asymmetric or nonuniform surface-brightness distribution
(Lopez et al. 2011).

The nonuniform density structure of the ambient medium
is indeed found in our radio data. Figure 8 shows the total
interstellar proton column density map Np(H2 + HI) com-
bining both the molecular (CO: NANTEN2) and atomic (HI:
McClure-Grifﬁths et al. 2005) components. The details of
the radio observations and data analysis are described in Ap-
pendix B. The velocity range of the gas density map is from
–118.0 km s−1 to –109.0 km s−1, which corresponds to the
kinematic distance of 6.2–6.4 kpc adopting a model of the
Galactic rotation curve by Brand & Blitz (1993). The veloc-
ity range is determined by CO/HI cavities in the position-
velocity diagrams (see Appendix B.3), suggesting an expand-
ing gas motion originated by accretion winds from the pro-
genitor system of the SNR (e.g., Sano et al. 2017, 2018).
Therefore, the molecular and atomic clouds at the velocity
range are likely associated with the SNR. The velocity range
and distance to the SNR are consistent with the previous HI
study by Giacani et al. (2011).

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ELEMENT STRATIFICATION IN SNR G344.7–0.1

We ﬁnd denser clouds possibly interacting with the SNR in
the west (Figure 8), consistent with the previous results from
the Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey (Burton et al.
2013; Braiding et al. 2015; Lau et al. 2019). The SNR expan-
sion is likely to be decelerated by this interaction toward the
west, resulting in the asymmetric morphology we observe.
This interpretation is supported by the temperature gradient
inferred from the mean energy map (Figure 2b); the lower
temperature is achieved in the northeast region probably due
to more efﬁcient adiabatic expansion. A similar tempera-
ture gradient due to the asymmetric ambient density distri-
bution is observed in other middle-aged SNRs, e.g., W49B
(Lopez et al. 2013; Yamaguchi et al. 2018). Alternatively,
the SN ejecta at the west could have been reheated by reﬂec-
tion shocks originating from the interaction with the dense
clouds, as was observed in, for instance, Kes 27 (Chen et al.
2008).

Figure 8. Map of total proton column density toward G344.7–
0.1. The integration velocity range is from –118.0 km s−1 to –
109.1 km s−1, corresponding to the distance of ∼ 6.3 kpc. The
half-power beamwidth is shown by ﬁeld circle. The scale bar is
calculated by assuming the distance of 6.3 kpc. The white con-
tours indicate a 843 MHz radio continuum obtained with MOST
(Whiteoak & Green 1996). The contour levels are 10.0, 12.5, 20.0,
32.5, 50.0, 72.5, and 100.0 mJy beam−1.

We have also discovered a local asymmetric structure at
the west rim, “Filament” in Figure 2(c).
Interestingly, the
measured IME abundances are enhanced with respect to the

solar values. Moreover, the relative abundances of S, Ar,
Ca to Si are comparable to the solar composition and that of
Mg is substantially lower, which is consistent with the typi-
cal nucleosynthesis yields of the incomplete Si burning (e.g.,
Iwamoto et al. 1999; Seitenzahl et al. 2013; Townsley et al.
2016). This implies an ejecta origin of this structure, despite
that its ﬁlamentary morphology and location being more con-
sistent with an interpretation of the forward shock front that
propagates into the ISM. If the structure is indeed dominated
by the SN ejecta, it is reminiscent of the ejecta knots in Ty-
cho SNR, suggesting that such local asymmetry is somewhat
common in a certain type of Type Ia SNRs.

4.3. Point-Like Sources

We have analyzed the spectra of the point-like sources de-
tected with the total photon counts of 30 or more (see Ta-
ble 2). The best-ﬁt parameters for the absorbed blackbody
model are given in Table 6, where the angular distance from
the explosion center to the sources is given as well. If the
sources are physically associated with the SNR, the measured
absorption column density must be consistent with that of the
SNR (5–7 ×1022 cm−2). We ﬁnd that only eight sources,
No. 31, 36, 39, 41, 42, 43, 48, and 49, satisfy this criterion,
and the other sources are most likely either foreground or
background objects.

Next, we compare the temperature and luminosity of these
sources with typical values for CCOs: kTbb = 0.2–0.5 keV
and 1033−34 erg s−1 (e.g. Pavlov et al. 2004; Gotthelf et al.
2013). We ﬁnd that four sources, No. 31, 36, 43 and 48 show
typical kTbb and luminosity as CCOs. These sources, how-
ever, have relatively large errors of 37–90% in NH. Thus, we
allow their NH values to vary in the error ranges of NH for the
corresponding regions in Table 3 for each source. We ﬁnally
ﬁnd that all these four sources have low luminosities with ex-
pected NH values of the different SNR regions. Therefore we
conclude that there is no CCO associated with G344.7–0.1.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The elemental distribution in SNRs is the key to under-
standing the explosion mechanism of SNe. We have pre-
sented the results of the deep Chandra observations of the
Type Ia SNR G344.7–0.1 revealed the distribution of the
SN ejecta. The X-ray images and radial proﬁles of the sur-
face brightness have revealed a centrally peaked distribution
of the Fe ejecta, surrounded by an arc-like structure of the
IMEs. The centroid energy of the Fe K emission is lower in
the central Fe-rich region than in the outer IME-rich regions,
suggesting that the Fe ejecta were heated by the reverse
shock more recently in the IME regions. These results are
consistent with predictions of standard SN Ia models, where
the heavier elements are synthesized in the interior of an
exploding white dwarf.

A. BACKGROUND ESTIMATION

An X-ray background consists of three major components,
non X-ray background (NXB), cosmic X-ray background
(CXB), and the Galactic thermal emission. The third com-
ponent is non-negligible in our study, since G344.7–0.1 is
located in the Galactic plane.

(∼2.20 keV), Ni Kα (∼7.47 keV), and Ni Kβ (∼8.29 keV).
We assume tbnew gas × powerlaw model for the
CXB emission.
The typical value of CXB normaliza-
tion is NCXB ∼ 8–10 photon keV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1 at 1 keV
(Nakashima et al. 2018, Suzaku). The solid angle of our
background region is (72 − 52)π arcmin2 ∼ 6.28 × 10−6 sr,
so we estimate the CXB normalization KCXB = 5.65 ×
10−5 photon keV−1 cm−2 s−1 at 1 keV. We ﬁx Γ = 1.40
and KCXB = 5.65 × 10−5 photon keV−1 cm−2 s−1 at 1 keV
for the CXB powerlaw. For the ﬁnal component, Galac-
tic thermal emissions, which are dominant in the 1–5 keV
band, we use two absorbed APEC models, as tbnew gas
× (apec+apec). Metal abundances of the APEC com-
ponents are assumed to be the solar value of Wilms et al.
(2000). We link the absorption column density NH to that of
the CXB. Table 7 gives the best-ﬁt parameters of our back-
ground model. This best-ﬁt model is shown in Figure 9.

FUKUSHIMA ET AL.

The intensities of the Galactic center X-ray emission
(GCXE) and Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE) are
modeled by Uchiyama et al. (2013) based on many Suzaku
observations. We compared the intensity of the Galac-
tic emission component
in our model with the predic-
tions of the GCXE and GRXE intensities in this paper.
We calculated the intensity in the 2.3–5.0 keV band based
on equation (1) in Uchiyama et al. (2013) and derived a
value of 12.6 × 10−7 photon s−1 cm−2 arcmin−2 which
compares with the value in our model of 12.1+4.2
−9.3 ×
10−7 photon s−1 cm−2 arcmin−2
90% errors).
Therefore, our model intensity for the Galactic emission
is consistent with the model predictions in Uchiyama et al.
(2013).

B. RADIO OBSERVATIONS

line

Observations of

B.1. CO and HI
12CO (J=1–0)
emission at
115.271202 GHz were executed in 2012 May 18th using
the NANTEN2 millimeter/submillimeter radio telescope.
The telescope is installed at 4865 m altitude of the Ata-
cama Desert in Chile, operated by Nagoya University. We
observed an area of 1◦×1◦ region using the on-the-ﬂy map-
ping mode with Nyquist sampling. The 4 K cooled Nb
superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixer receiver was
used for the front end. The system temperature including
the atmosphere was ∼200 K in the double-side band. The
backend was a digital Fourier-transform spectrometer with
1684 channels or 1 GHz bandwidth, corresponding to a ve-
locity coverage of 2600 km s−1 and a velocity resolution of
0.16 km s−1. After convolving the cube data with a two-
dimensional Gaussian kernel of 90′′, the ﬁnal beam size was
∼ 180′′ in FWHM. The absolute intensity was calibrated by
observing the standard source IRAS 16293–2422 [(αJ2000,
δJ2000)=(16h32m23s.3, –24◦28′39′′.2)] (Ridge et al. 2006).
We also observed IRC+10216 every day, and the pointing
accuracy was better than 10′′. The typical noise ﬂuctuation
of the ﬁnal dataset is ∼0.65 K at the velocity resolution of
0.63 km s−1.

The HI line data at 1.4 GHz is from the Southern Galac-
tic Plane Survey (SGPS; McClure-Grifﬁths et al. 2005). The
archival dataset was obtained using a combination of the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and Parkes ra-
dio telescope. The angular resolution is 130′′ and the veloc-
ity resolution is 0.82 km s−1. The typical noise ﬂuctuation is
∼1.9 K at the velocity resolution of 0.82 km s−1.

B.2. Estimation of Total ISM Protons

To obtain the total proton column density map, we es-
timate proton column densities in both the molecular and
atomic clouds (e.g., Fukui et al. 2012, 2017; Kuriki et al.
2018; Sano et al. 2019). The proton column density of

molecular cloud Np(H2) can be estimated from the follow-
ing equations:

N (H2) = XCO · W (CO) (cm
Np(H2) = 2 × N (H2) (cm

−2)
−2)

where N (H2) is the column density of molecular hydrogen
in units of cm−2, XCO is the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in
units of (K km s−1)−1 cm−2, and W (CO) is the integrated
intensity of CO in units of K km s−1. In the present paper, we
used XCO = 2.0 × 1020 (K km s−1)−1 cm−2 (Bertsch et al.
1993).

On the other hand, an estimation of the proton column den-
sity of atomic cloud Np(HI) is tricky because we should
consider the optical depth of HI. According to Fukui et al.
(2015), 91% of atomic hydrogen in local clouds has an opti-
cal depth of 0.5 or higher with respect to the HI line emission.
Therefore we cannot use the well-known equation assuming
the optical depth of HI ≪ 1 (e.g., Dickey & Lockman 1990):

Np(HI) = 1.823 × 1018W (HI) (cm

−2)

where W (HI) is the integrated intensity of HI in units of
K km s−1.

To estimate the optical-depth-corrected proton column
density of atomic cloud Np(HI)’, we used a relation be-
tween W (HI) and Np(HI)’ presented by Fukui et al. (2017).
The authors derived Np(HI)’ as a function of W (HI) us-
ing the dust opacity map at 353 GHz obtained from IRAS
and Planck datasets (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014) tak-
ing into account nonlinear dust properties (e.g., Roy et al.
2013; Okamoto et al. 2017; Hayashi et al. 2019a,b). In the
present paper, we derived a conversion factor from W (HI) to
Np(HI)’ ﬁtted by the result of Fukui et al. (2017) as a func-
tion of W (HI). We obtained averaged value of Np(HI)’ to-
ward G344.7–0.1 is ∼1.2×1021 cm−2, which is ∼2.3 times
higher than that of Np(HI) assuming the optically thin case.
Finally, we derived the total proton column density map
Np(H2 + HI) combining Np(HI)’ and Np(H2) whose an-
gular resolution is smoothed to match the FWHM of NAN-
TEN2 beam size of ∼180′′ (see Figure 8).

B.3. An Expanding Gas Motion

Giacani et al. (2011) argued that G344.7–0.1 is likely as-
sociated with an open HI shell at the central velocity of
∼ 115 km s−1, corresponding to the kinematic distance of
6.3 ± 0.1 kpc. Here, we investigate the cloud association by
using both the CO and HI datasets.

Figures 10(a) and 10(c) show the integrated intensity maps
of HI and CO at a velocity of ∼ 115 km s−1, respectively.
We found a presence of shell-like structure not only in the
HI map, but also in the CO map. The CO clouds nicely sur-
round the SNR, especially for the northern half of the shell.

Figure 10. (a), (c) Integrated intensity map of (a) HI and (c) CO
superposed on the MOST 843 MHz radio continuum. The integra-
tion velocity range and contour levels are the same as in Figure 8.
The scale bars at a distance of 6.3 kpc and half-power beamwidths
are also shown in the bottom right corner. The dashed vertical lines
indicate the integration range of the position-velocity diagram in the
Figures 10(b) and 10(d). (b), (d) Position-velocity diagrams of (b)
HI and (d) CO. The integration range in R.A. is from 255◦.95 to
256◦.03. The beam size and velocity resolution of each map are
shown in the bottom right corner. The dashed curves indicate a
boundary of the CO or HI cavity in the position-velocity diagram
(see the text).

Figures 10(b) and 10(d) show the position-velocity diagrams
of HI and CO, respectively. We found cavity-like structures
of HI and CO (dashed lines) in the velocity range from –
118.0 km s−1 to –109.1 km s−1, which have a similar diam-
eter to G344.7–0.1 in terms of the decl. These cavity-like
structures represent an expanding gas motion similar to a
“wind-blown shell,” originated by strong winds from the pro-
genitor system: e.g., stellar winds from a high-mass progen-
itor or accretion winds (also known as “disk winds”) from
a single degenerate progenitor system of Type Ia SNR. For
the case of Type Ia SNR G344.7–0.1, the latter origin is
favored. The expansion velocity of molecular and atomic
clouds ∆V is estimated to be ∼ 4.5 km s−1, which is consis-
tent with the previous studies of interstellar environments in
the Type Ia SNRs (e.g., Tycho, ∆V ∼ 4.5 km s−1, Zhou et al.
2016; N103B, ∆V ∼ 5 km s−1, Sano et al. 2018).
In any
case, the SNR shock wave travels through the wind-blown
shell during the free expansion phase, and is ﬁnally deceler-
ated when the shockwave encounters the wind wall. There-
fore, the size of the SNR generally coincides with that of the
wind-blown shell. Summarizing the above considerations,
both the molecular and atomic clouds in the velocity range
from –118.0 km s−1 to –109.1 km s−1 are likely associated
with the SNR G344.7–0.1, which is consistent with the pre-
vious HI study by Giacani et al. (2011).
