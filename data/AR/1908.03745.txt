tension by molecular dynamics simulation

Although they are rare elements in the Earth’s mantle, noble gases (NG) owe to their strongly varying masses
(a factor > 50 from He to Rn) contrasting physical behaviors making them important geochemical tracers.
When partial melting occurs at depth, the partitioning of NGs between phases is controlled by a distribution
coeﬃcient that can be determined from the solubility of the NGs in each phase.
Here we report quantitative calculations of the solubility of He, Ne, Ar and Xe in carbonate melts based
on molecular dynamics simulations. The NG solubilities are ﬁrst calculated in K2CO3-CaCO3 mixtures at 1
bar and favorably compared to the only experimental data available to date. Then we investigate the eﬀect
of pressure (up to 6 GPa), focusing on two melt compositions: a dolomitic one and a natrocarbonatitic one
(modeling the lava emitted at Ol Doinyo Lengai). The solubility decreases with the amount of alkaline-earth
cation in the melt and with the size of the noble gas. In the natrocarbonatitic melt, Henry’s law is fulﬁlled
at low pressures (up to
0.1 GPa). At higher pressures (a few GPa) the solubility levels oﬀ or even starts to
diminish smoothly (for He at P > 2 GPa and Ar at P > 4 GPa). In contrast, in molten dolomite the eﬀect
of pressure is negligible on the studied P range (3
6 GPa). At the pressures of the Earth’s mantle, the
solubilities of noble gases in carbonate melts are still of the same order of magnitude as the ones in molten
silicates (100
101 mol%). This suggests that carbonatitic melts at depth are not preferential carriers of
noble gases, even if the dependence with the melt composition is not negligible and has to be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis.
Finally we evaluate the surface tension at the interface between carbonate melts and noble gases and its
evolution with pressure. Whatever the composition of the melt and of the NG phase, the surface tension
increases (by a factor
2) when P increases from 0 to 6 GPa. This behavior contrasts with the situation
occurring when H2O is in contact with silicate melts (then surface tension drops when pressure increases to
a few GPa).

INTRODUCTION

By the time of accretion, noble gases were already
present in proto-Earth material.1 Their concentration in
the mantle has since evolved through the competing eﬀect
of volcanic degassing and radioactive decay. Although
they are inert species their strongly varying masses in
the series from He to Rn confer them contrasting physical
behaviors in the Earth’s mantle. Hence these elements
(and their isotopes even more so) constitute important
geochemical tracers.2 More speciﬁcally, noble gases are
incompatible in mantle rocks and tend to partition into
the liquid phase when partial melting occurs at depth.
In the presence of two immiscible liquids, the partion-
ing is determined by a distribution coeﬃcient, that is
related to the ratio of the solubility of the noble gas in
each phase. For example a carbonatite-silicate immis-
cibility is currently the most probable scenario for the
genesis of the natrocarbonatites emitted by Ol Doinyo
Lengai in Tanzania.3 In a more general perspective, the
noble gas systematics provides an insight into the past
and present dynamics of the carbon-bearing phases (sili-

cates and/or carbonates) in the Earth’s mantle (e.g. the
carbon cycle). Hence solubility data under high pressure
and in diﬀerent magmatic liquids, are requisite in order
to study these phenomena. Whereas many studies have
been devoted to the solubility of noble gases in molten
silicates (mainly at low pressures),4–9 very little is known
concerning their behavior in carbonate melts which are
yet of particular interest.10–13
To date, the only experimental constraints are given by
Burnard et al.,12 who measured the solubility of noble
gases in quenched carbonate melts. In this approach the
concentration in the liquid is assumed to be the same as
in the glass resulting from the quenching. Moreover the
quenching is considered to be fast enough to avoid crystal
nucleation. The study reported the solubility of He and
Ar in some K2CO3-CaCO3 mixtures at 1 bar between
1123 and 1223 K. The authors also attempted to study
Mg-bearing carbonate melts, but could not succeed in
quenching them into a glass.
By contrast, in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
the liquid phase can always be studied, regardless of
its composition (and of the pressure/temperature con-
dition). The relevance of the liquid properties calculated
from a MD simulation relies on the quality of the im-
plemented interaction potential or force ﬁeld (FF). The
adjustment of the FF generally is system-speciﬁc. In a

 
 
 
 
 
 
previous study we have presented a FF to model car-
bonate melts in the CaCO3–MgCO3–K2CO3–Na2CO3–
Li2CO3 system, and demonstrated that it leads to an ac-
curate reproduction of their thermodynamics, structure
and transport properties.14,15 Here we perform molecular
dynamics simulations based on this FF to study the solu-
bility of noble gases (from He to Xe) into K2CO3-CaCO3
mixtures (for comparison with the data of Burnard et
al.12) and into dolomitic and natrocarbonatitic melts to
investigate the evolution with pressure (up to 6 GPa).
First we present in section II the method to evaluate the
noble gas solubility. The results are discussed in sec-
tion III. The surface tension of carbonate melts in con-
tact with a noble gas ﬂuid is evaluated and discussed in
section IV.

al.14,15 The interactions between noble gas (NG) atoms
were modeled by the FF used by Guillot and Sator.16
These Buckingham potentials (see Eq. (A.1) in Ap-
pendix A) were adjusted on the accurate potential energy
surface derived by Tang and Toennies.17 As for the inter-
actions between the NG and the carbonate melt elements,
they are described by two contributions, a NG-cation
and a NG-carbonate one, both of them being modeled
by Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials (Eq. (A.2)). For the
NG-cation interactions we used the LJ parameters deter-
mined by Guillot and Sator 16 for the
}
system. For the interaction between the NG and the
oxygen atoms of the carbonate ions, we retained the pa-
rameters established by Aubry et al.18 for the system
and set the interactions between
silicate + CO2 + NG
{
}
the NG and the carbon atom of the carbonate anion to
zero, as the carbon is considered to be screened by the
surrounding oxygen atoms14,15 (in fact, the carbon atom
is deeply embedded into the oxygen electronic clouds).
The choice of such a force ﬁeld is based on the assumption
that the interaction potentials between NGs and melts
cited above are transferable from a melt to another (e.g.
CO2-bearing silicate to carbonate). It is justiﬁed a poste-
riori by the agreement between the calculated solubilities
and the solubility data of Burnard et al.12 (see Section
III).

1600 K and 0.1 GPa) by simulating explicitly the liquid/gas
interface (up). The density proﬁle of the noble gas component
is established perpendicularly to the interface (down). The
solubility ρs(z)/ρtot(z) of the species s (Ne in green or melt
in blue) is calculated from the plateau value of the density
proﬁle. The inset emphasizes the density proﬁle of the noble
gas in the melt.

A. Force Field

To describe the interactions within the carbonate melt
we used the interatomic FF proposed by Desmaele et

where ρm and ρv are the number densities of the pure
melt and of the vapor phase (noble gas), respectively,
and Γm and Γv are the solubility constants of the noble
gas in the melt and in its pure phase, respectively.
At low pressure P , the gas phase can be considered as
ideal, allowing to retrieve Henry’s law from Eq. (1):

X = P/kH ,

(2)

where kH = ρmkBT /Γm is the Henry constant. The sol-
ubility of noble gases in the melt was calculated by the
Test Particle Method (TPM) introduced by Widom.19
This method allows to determine the excess chemical po-
tential of a solute in a solvent, as a function of the po-
tential energy distribution seen by the solute inserted in
the solvent (at inﬁnite dilution), namely

where µex,i is the excess chemical potential of a solute i
(e.g. a noble gas), kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the
temperature, Ψi is the interaction energy between the so-
lute i and the solvent (e.g. a carbonate melt) in which it
is solvated, and
0 means that a statistical averaging
is done on the solvent molecules only, at a given (T, P )
condition. Notice that the solute particle acts as a ghost
particle, and that many insertions of the latter particle in
the solvent conﬁgurations are needed to accurately eval-
uate µex (for further details see Guillot and Sator 16 and
Appendix B 2).
In practice a set of microscopic conﬁgurations of the melt
is ﬁrst generated by MD. Then the insertion of the solute
particle (the noble gas atom) is attempted many times
into the MD-generated conﬁguration. For each insertion
of the solute particle the interaction energy Ψ is calcu-
lated.
The solubility parameter Γ is then evaluated by the av-
eraging over all the attempted insertions

where Ntest is the number of attempted insertions. Ac-
cording to this method, the solubility parameter Γ can
be evaluated in the two coexisting phases: the carbon-
ate melt and the noble gas phase (providing Γm and Γv),
and the solubility of the NG can be easily obtained from
Eq. (1).

C. Explicit Interface Method (EIM)

As an alternative to the TPM, the solubility of a gas
in a melt can be calculated from a numerical experiment
which consists in simulating explicitly the equilibrium
between the two phases (for further details see Guillot
and Sator 16,20). The solubility is then simply obtained
by counting the average number of noble gas atoms in the
melt, once equilibrium is reached between the two phases,
i.e. when the liquid is saturated in gas (Figure 1).

D. Complementarity between the two methods

Depending on the thermodynamic conditions of inter-
est, one of the two methods presented above is the most
appropriate one to calculate the solubility. Thus in the
framework of the TPM, the solubility parameter Γm is
theoretically deﬁned at inﬁnite dilution, which means
that it is only meaningful for low concentrations of NG in
the melt. On the contrary the explicit interface method
(EIM) becomes useful when the pressure of the gas phase
is suﬃciently high for the simulated melt to accommo-
date a signiﬁcant number of NG atoms.
In brief, the
TPM will be used at low pressures and the EIM at high

3

pressures.
In this context we have checked that the two methods
give results that are consistent with one another. For

III. SOLUBILITY

A. Low pressure

First we focus on the mixtures studied by Burnard et
al.,12 namely K2CO3–Na2CO3 mixtures at 1173 K and
1 bar. The solubilities calculated by MD by the means
of the TPM, and the ones measured by Burnard et al.12
are reported on Figure 2. For some mixtures Burnard et
al.12 have made several measurements of the solubility
of helium. The error bars on each measurement is low
and comprised within the symbol of Figure 2. However
the data dispersion for the He solubility at a given melt
composition suggests that the uncertainty on the exper-
imental results is actually greater than 50 %. According
to the authors, this could be due to the fast diﬀusion of
the He gas out of the glass upon quenching. This He
loss is likely systematic although its magnitude is vary-
ing. So the solubility data given by Burnard et al.12 for
He should be considered as a lower limit. Hence the re-
sults of our simulations for He are compatible with the
measurements of Burnard et al.12 In contrast, for Ar the
agreement between the TPM results and the experimen-
tal data is better. This is consistent with the assumption
made for He (gas loss), because Ar being a heavier ele-
ment it less easily escapes out of the quenched sample.
Beside He and Ar, we report the solubility for Ne and
Xe. For a given composition of the liquid, the solubility
increases as the atomic radius of the NG decreases. This
behavior is similar to the one observed in silicates, where
the solubility is related to the ionic porosity.16 Such a
solvation mechanism can be termed as entropic, as it is
mainly related to the structural disorder and cavity for-
mation in the liquid. In contrast, in polar solvents (e.g.
water) the solvation of NG is enthalpically driven with
a solubility that increases with the polarizability of the
solute21,22 (i.e. with the size of the NG).
In their study, Burnard et al.12 reported that the solu-
bility is hardly sensitive to the composition of the melt.
We believe that the high uncertainties on their data as
well as the narrowness of the studied composition range
0.5) are accountable for this observa-
(0.2 < xK2CO3 ≤
tion. On the contrary MD simulations reveal that the
composition of the melt has a strong eﬀect (especially
for xK2CO3 < 0.25 and xK2CO3 > 0.4), regardless of the

increases. For instance the solubility of He contrasts by
an order of magnitude between the two end-members
K2CO3 end CaCO3 (see Figure 2).

various K2CO3–CaCO3 mixtures at 1173 K and 1 bar. The
TPM results from this study are represented by plain black
symbols, the measurements of Burnard et al.12 by red empty
symbols. The error bars for the MD results are of the order
of the size of the symbols (see text). The inset focuses on the
region of low values for Ar and Xe solubilities.

B. Evolution with pressure

Simulating a biphasic system (EI method) enables
to calculate the NG solubility under high pressures.
We focus on two carbonate melts: molten dolomite
(Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3) at 1673 K and a Na2CO3–K2CO3–
CaCO3 mixture (in proportions 55, 9 and 36 mol%, re-
spectively) at 1600 K, modeling the natrocarbonatite
emitted at Ol Doinyo Lengai.15,23 Figure 3 reports the
solubility of He, Ne, Ar and Xe calculated at pressures
ranging from 3 to 6 GPa for dolomite, and from 0.1 to
6 GPa for the natrocarbonatite. The solubilities in the
natrocarbonatite were also calculated at 1 bar using the
TPM.
Over the whole studied pressure range, the solubility
of a given NG is greater in the natrocarbonatite than
in molten dolomite. This is consistent with the de-
crease of the solubility when increasing the molar frac-
tion of alkaline-earth cation as observed at low pressure
in K2CO3-CaCO3 mixtures (Figure 2). The observation

in natrocarbonatite at 1600 K (black) and in dolomite at
1673 K (brown) as a function of pressure. The dotted lines are
guides to the eye. Empty symbols represent the results of the
TPM at 1 bar for He (0.0012 mol%), Ne (0.00089 mol%), Ar
(0.00030 mol%) and Xe (0.00014 mol%) in natrocarbonatite.
The black lines represent Henry’s law deduced from the latter
values. The inset compares the solubility of Ar calculated in
natrocarbonatite (black) and in dolomite (brown) to the one
measured in tholeiite (green) by Schmidt and Keppler.8

that the solubility is negatively correlated with the size
of the NG still stands at high pressure (at least up to
3 GPa). However beyond 3 GPa, the solubilities of Ne
and He come close to each other in natrocarbonatite and
even tend to cross at about 6 GPa (He shows a solubil-
ity maximum at about 2 GPa), features which are also
observed in dolomite. In the same way, the solubility of
Xe in natrocarbonatite increases steadily and becomes as
high as the one of Ar at 6 GPa, the latter leveling oﬀ at
about 1 GPa.
In the natrocarbonatite melt, the solubility of NGs ﬁrst
increases quasi linearly with pressure, so Henry’s law is
fulﬁlled up to a few kbar (Figure 3). Above
1 GPa the
solubility generally levels oﬀ and it even goes through a
maximum for He at P
4 GPa.
As for Xe, its solubility is quasi linear with P (up to
In molten dolomite, the solubility of noble

gases barely depends on pressure between 3 and 6 GPa.
In comparison the solubility of noble gases in silicate
melts increases up to
5 GPa. At higher pressures,
some experimental studies report a drop of the solubility9
and other do not.8,24 In their simulation study Guillot
and Sator 16 show a good agreement with the experimen-

2 GPa and for Ar at P

higher pressures. This trend is similar to what we observe
in molten carbonates (Figure 3), although the solubility
plateau occurs at a lower pressure for carbonates. In any
case at the pressures of the Earth’s upper mantle, our re-
sults point out that the solubility of the nobles gases has
the same order of magnitude in molten carbonates and in
molten silicates.16 This suggests that noble gases would
not partition massively in a carbonated phase. However,
seeing the signiﬁcant dependence of the NG solubilities
with the composition of the melt (a factor of
3 for
Ar in dolomitic versus natrocarbonatitic melts, see the
inset of Figure 3) the investigation of the partition coef-
ﬁcients between carbonate and silicate deserves a further
studying. Still, considering that carbonatite melts only
represent a minor fraction of magmatic liquids, they can
unlikely be the main carrier of noble gases.

IV. SURFACE TENSION

To our knowledge, there are no data of the pressure
evolution of the surface tension at the interface between
a noble gas phase and molten carbonates, despite the in-
terest in a geochemical perspective. For example if we
consider a gas-saturated magmatic melt, it is the liq-
uid/gas surface tension that controls the formation, the

FIG. 4. Pressure evolution of the surface tension between a
noble gas ﬂuid and the natrocarbonatite at 1600 K (black) and

surface tension of the natrocarbonatite at 1600 K (black) and

growth and the coalescence of gas bubbles below a cer-
tain supersaturation pressure.25
By simulating a biphasic system in MD as shown in Fig-
ure 1 for the calculation of the solubility by the EIM,
the surface tension γ can be calculated simultaneously
for the same computational cost. It is given by the long
time limit of the average of the diagonal components of
the stress tensor:26

where Lz is the length of the simulation box perpendicu-
lar to the interface and Πxx, Πyy and Πzz are the diagonal
components of the stress tensor evaluated in the entire
simulation box (see Desmaele et al. 14 for more details).
Figure 4 plots the surface tension between the na-
trocarbonatitic (or dolomitic) melt and the noble gas
phase (He, Ne, Ar and Xe), calculated at diﬀerent pres-
sures. For natrocarbonatite at 1600 K the surface ten-
sion was also calculated at the interface with a vacuum
(190
3 mN/m). This value compares well with the
ones obtained at the interface with noble gases at 0.1 GPa
(171
Irrespective of the nature of the melt and of the noble gas
considered, the surface tension increases with increasing
pressure. In contrast, it is known that the surface ten-
sion of silicate melts in contact with H2O decreases with
pressure.27 The behavior of carbonate melts may some-
how appear as counter-intuitive because with increasing
pressure the density of the gas phase approaches that of
the melt, thus the energetic cost to create the interface
should decrease. However the surface tension involves
subtle mechanisms which are likely pressure-dependent.
Among other factors, the amount of gas solubilized in
the melt which increases with pressure (see previous sec-
tion) could be responsible for a non-negligible contribu-
tion (positive or negative) to the surface stress. On the
one hand, it could tend to destabilize the melt (and thus
decrease γ), but on the other hand the gas phase in con-
tact with the melt can act like a piston and rigidify the
In any case, the solu-
interface (and thus increase γ).
bilized gas is likely not the only factor in action as the
rather large diﬀerences of solubility observed between the
four gases (almost a factor of ten between He and Xe, see
Figure 3) are not retrieved for the surface tension (see
Figure 4).
There is also a distinct eﬀect of the melt composition on
the surface tension: For a given noble gas species and
at a given pressure, the surface tension of dolomite is
greater than the one of the natrocarbonatite by
50%.
This increase of the surface tension with the amount of
alkaline-earth cations in the melt is also observed at the
interface with a vacuum28 (compare the values of γ for
the natrocarbonatite and for the CaCO3 melt on Fig-
ure 4).
As for the eﬀect of the gas composition, it is trickier to
decipher. At a given pressure and for a given melt compo-

as a function of the size of the noble gas atom (except for
He in dolomite, see Figure 4). Moreover, when pressure
is increased the hierarchy between noble gases seems to
modify somewhat. It is possible that the uncertainties on
the calculated values are greater than the ones we esti-
5%, see Figure C.1 in the
mate from the ﬂuctuations (
appendix) of the running average of Eq. (5).

V. CONCLUSION

To complete and go beyond the precursory study of
Burnard et al.,12 the solubility of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar
and Xe) in carbonate melts was calculated by molecular
dynamics simulations. These simulations used empiri-
cal interaction potentials whose accuracy was previously
demonstrated in studying the thermodynamic and trans-
port properties of carbonate melts and the solubility of
noble gases in silicate melt.14–16,28
The NG solubilities were ﬁrst calculated in K2CO3-
CaCO3 mixtures at 1 bar and the results are in a fair
agreement with the data of Burnard et al.12 once consid-
ered the uncertainties on the experimental values. Then
we investigated the eﬀect of pressure (up to 6 GPa), fo-
cusing on two melt compositions: a dolomitic one and
a mixture modeling the carbonatitic lava emitted at Ol
Doinyo Lengai. We observed that the solubility decreases
with the amount of alkaline-earth cation in the melt and
with the size of the noble gas (entropy-driven solubility).
Concerning the solubility in the natrocarbonatitic melt,
0.1 GPa).
Henry’s law is fulﬁlled at low pressures (
At higher pressures (a few GPa) the solubility levels oﬀ
or even starts to diminish smoothly (for He at P > 2
GPa and Ar at P > 4 GPa).
In contrast, in molten
dolomite the eﬀect of pressure is negligible on the stud-
6 GPa). At the pressures of the Earth’s
ied P range (3
mantle, the solubilities of noble gases in carbonate melts
are still of the same order of magnitude as the ones in
molten silicates, a ﬁnding in agreement with the ratio
4He/40Ar measured in the gas emitted from Ol Doinyo
Lengai crater in 2005, which is close to the mantle value
(see Fischer et al. 3 ). Furthermore this ﬁnding also sug-
gests that carbonatitic melts at depth cannot be prefer-
ential carriers of noble gases.
Finally we provided some insight into the surface ten-
sion at the interface between carbonate melts and noble
gases. With increasing pressure (P from 0 to 6 GPa),
the surface tension increases (by a factor
2), whatever
the composition of the melt and of the NG phase. This
is in strong contrast with the eﬀect of H2O on the sur-
face tension of silicate melts which drops when pressure
increases to a few GPa.

to be calculated.

2. Simulation details

Classical MD simulations of the carbonate melt (N
(cid:39)
1000 atoms) were carried out using the DL POLY 2
software,29 with a timestep of 1 fs. The simulations were
performed in the N V E ensemble with an equilibration
run of 0.5 ns, followed by a production run of at least
10 ns.
Insertion of the test particle in the simulation
box was attempted every 1000 timesteps (1 ps) on a grid
of width dL, with L/dL = 10 to 50 (i.e. the grid has
103 = 1000 to 503 = 125000 nodes, Figure B.2 evidences
that convergence is reached for L/dL
30). In practice,
if the distance between the node and a solvent atom is
too small (within a deﬁned cutoﬀ radius rmin, see Fig-
ure B.1), the insertion is rejected and a null contribution
is added to the average of Eq. (4) (because the value of
e−Ψ/kB T in Eq. (4) is vanishingly small for this event).
Note that when the density of the solvent is high or when
the inserted particle has a large van der Waals radius, the
rate of rejection for the insertion is high and uncertainties
may become important(e.g. Ne, Ar and Xe in K2CO3,

FIG. B.1.
Schematic representation of the test-particle
method on given 2D conﬁguration of the solvent. A meshing
of the simulation box is deﬁned (e.g. L/dL = 5, gray dashed
line) then the insertion of the test-particle is attempted on
each node (dashed circles). The interaction energy between
the solute and the solvent Ψi is calculated under the condition
that no solvent atom is located within a previously deﬁned
cutoﬀ radius rmin.
If that radius overlaps a solvent atom
(red circle), Ψi is very large (repulsive conﬁguration) and its
contribution to e−Ψi/kB T is null. Only the events where the
test-particle is inserted within a solvent cage are signiﬁcant
for the solubilty (green circle).

1. Thermodynamics

Calculating the solubility of a noble gas within a melt
consists in considering a thermodynamic equilibrium be-
tween the gas and the melt (in contact with each other),
expressed by the equality of the chemical potentials of
the gas in both phases:

µv = µm .

(B.1)

rminrminsee Figure 2). In this study, the solubility calculations
using this method have uncertainties of a few percents.

The EIM simulations consisted in modeling the solvent
2000 atoms of melt) in contact with a NG phase
(N
in a parallelepipedic simulation box. The number of NG
atoms in the box (N
300 - 900 atoms) was chosen so
that the vapor phase was large enough for the consecu-
tive periodic images of the melt to not interact with one
another.
An equilibration run was ﬁrst performed in the N P T en-
semble (using a Nos´e-Hoover thermostat) for 0.9 ns (in-
cluding 0.5 ns to equilibrate the temperature) allowing to
1%
reach an accuracy on the density value of ∆n/n
for the two coexisting phases. To evaluate the solubil-
ity X, simulations were performed in the N V E ensemble
with an equilibration run of 0.5 ns, followed by a produc-
tion run of 10 ns. Conﬁgurations were extracted every
1 ps to determine the density proﬁles and calculate the
surface tension between the NG ﬂuids and the carbonate
melts (Figure C.1).

tion length. The distance between two attempted insertions
