ABSTRACT

The chromosphere above active regions (ARs) on the Sun hosts magnetized supersonic downﬂows. Studies of these supersonic
downﬂows help to decipher the magnetic ﬁne structure and dynamics of the chromosphere. We perform a statistical analysis of the
magnetized supersonic downﬂows in a number of ARs at diﬀerent evolutionary stages and survey their characteristics. We analyze
spectro-polarimetric scans of parts of 13 ARs obtained in the infrared He i 10830 Å triplet formed in the upper chromosphere recorded
with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) mounted at the GREGOR solar telescope. We retrieve the line-of-sight velocities
and the magnetic ﬁeld vector using the HeLIx+ inversion code that assumes Milne-Eddington atmospheres. We ﬁnd magnetized
supersonic downﬂows in all the ARs, with larger area coverage by such ﬂows in ARs observed during their emerging phase. The fact
that supersonic downﬂows were detected in all scans, though they cover only a small fraction, 0.2–6.4 %, of the observed ﬁeld-of-
view, suggests that they are a comparatively common phenomenon in the upper chromospheres of ARs. The supersonic downﬂows
are found to be associated with many AR features such as pores, sunspot umbrae, sunspot penumbrae, light bridges, plages, He i
loops as part of arch ﬁlament systems characteristic of emerging ﬁelds, and ﬁlaments. Although several mechanisms are identiﬁed
to be causing the supersonic downﬂows, by far the most common one appears to be the draining of plasma along the legs of rising
magnetic loops. The loops mainly drain into forming pores. The line-of-sight velocities of the supersonic downﬂows reach values
1 and the velocity distribution shows multiple populations. Almost 92 % of these supersonic downﬂows coexist with
up to 49 km s−
a subsonic ﬂow component. The weaker, more horizontal ﬁelds associated with the supersonic component suggests that it is formed
above the subsonic component.

1. Introduction

The chromosphere above active regions (ARs) is known to host
fast downﬂows, which exceed the local sound speed (see e. g.
Penn & Kuhn 1995; Schmidt et al. 2000; Solanki et al. 2003;
Lagg et al. 2004). Although such supersonic downﬂows have
been seen in the chromosphere, it is still unclear how common
they are, nor do we have any robust indication of their average
properties. Our focus in this paper is therefore on the statisti-
cal exploration of the properties of the velocity and magnetic
ﬁelds connected with supersonic downﬂows in the upper chro-
mosphere.

Spectral lines that form at chromospheric heights allow us to
probe the plasma dynamics and the magnetic ﬁelds in the chro-
mosphere. One such spectral line system is the He i 10830 Å
triplet formed almost exclusively in a narrow layer in the up-
per chromosphere (Avrett et al. 1994; Schmidt et al. 1994). This
unusual formation process simpliﬁes the analysis and makes the
triplet an extremely valuable tool for studying magnetic and dy-
namic phenomena in the chromosphere (Lagg et al. 2017).

Numerous studies have exploited the diagnostic capabilities
of the He i 10830 Å lines to probe the chromospheric plasma ve-
locities. Penn & Kuhn (1995) reported very high velocity red-
1) in a He i 10830 Å ﬁlament. Multiple veloc-
shifts (30

60 km s−

ity components were seen in a single AR observed with the Ger-
man Vacuum Tower Telescope by Muglach et al. (1997) and in
an AR observed with the German Gregory Coudé Telescope by
Muglach & Sütterlin (1998). Using the time sequence of the slit
spectra of the He i 10830 Å lines that were reported in Muglach
et al. (1997), Schmidt et al. (2000) found signatures of a steady
downﬂow in addition to material almost at rest.

Chromospheric downﬂows in emerging ﬂux regions (EFRs),
where the sub-surface magnetic ﬂux breaks through the solar
surface and forms magnetic loops, have gained increased atten-
tion since the study by Solanki et al. (2003) with an AR observed
in He i 10830 Å lines. The EFRs appear as dark loops in the
chromosphere connecting regions of opposite polarity and are
commonly termed arch ﬁlament systems (AFS). Solanki et al.
(2003) detected upﬂows in the loop tops and downﬂows near
the loop footpoints. Using the same observations, Lagg et al.
(2004, 2007) further investigated the velocity structure and ob-
1. These supersonic
tained downﬂow speeds of up to 40 km s−
downﬂows in the chromosphere were found to be persistent and
to coexist with a second atmospheric component almost at rest
within the same spatial resolution element (e.g., Schmidt et al.
2000; Lagg et al. 2007; Schad et al. 2011; González Manrique
et al. 2018; Yadav et al. 2019; González Manrique et al. 2020).

Supersonic downﬂows in the He i 10830 Å lines (faster than
1 at the He i 10830 Å triplet
the typical sound speed of 10 km s−
formation temperature of about 8000–10000 K) coexisting with
a component nearly at rest always present themselves in the
Stokes proﬁles as an additional redshifted component (e.g., Fig.
9 of Lagg et al. 2004). Attempts were made to ﬁt such in-
tensity proﬁles to determine the plasma properties using multi-
Gaussian functions (Aznar Cuadrado et al. 2005, 2007) and mul-
tiLorentzian functions (González Manrique et al. 2016, 2018).
Multicomponent inversions of the full Stokes vector are a more
advanced way to analyze the data. They were employed (Lagg
et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2010; Sasso et al. 2011) to analyze both
velocity and magnetic ﬁelds. We follow this approach and ﬁt all
the four Stokes parameters to obtain the magnetic ﬁeld vector
along with the velocity.

Polarization in the He i lines is generated by the combined
action of anisotropic scattering and Zeeman eﬀect (Trujillo
Bueno & Asensio Ramos 2007). The eﬀective Landé factors of
these lines allow for a reliable measurement of magnetic ﬁelds
100 G using the Zeeman eﬀect (Lagg
with a strength above 50
et al. 2017). Observations of Stokes polarization parameters in
the He i 10830 Å lines have been used to probe magnetic ﬁelds
in sunspots (e.g., Harvey & Hall 1971; Rüedi et al. 1995; Cen-
teno et al. 2006), EFRs (Solanki et al. 2003; Lagg et al. 2004,
2007) as well as to investigate weaker magnetic ﬁelds in a variety
of plasma structures such as chromospheric spicules (e.g., Tru-
jillo Bueno et al. 2005; Socas-Navarro & Elmore 2005; Martínez
González et al. 2012), prominences (e.g., Merenda et al. 2006),
and ﬁlaments (e.g. Penn & Kuhn 1995; Lin et al. 1998; Trujillo
Bueno et al. 2002).

The analysis of the chromospheric downﬂows using the He i
10830 Å lines have so far been mostly conﬁned to observa-
tions of individual ARs (or even just parts of ARs) and a com-
prehensive study of the characteristics of these downﬂows is
still missing. Here, we analyze the spectropolarimetric scans
of parts of 13 ARs and investigate the properties of the mag-
netized supersonic downﬂows in the chromosphere. Details of
these observations and the data analysis technique are described
in Sect. 2. The detected supersonic downﬂows are presented in
Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we describe how frequent the magnetized su-
personic downﬂows are, the solar structures they are associated
with, along with their velocity and magnetic ﬁeld distributions.
In Sect. 5 we discuss the possible mechanisms through which
downﬂows become supersonic. We present our conclusions in
Sect. 6.

2. Observations and data analysis

2.1. Data and reduction

The data were recorded with the GREGOR Infrared Spectro-
graph (GRIS; Collados et al. 2012) mounted at the 1.5 m GRE-
GOR solar telescope (Schmidt et al. 2012; Denker et al. 2012)
at the Observatorio del Teide. The observations, summarized in
Table 1, consist of 14 spectropolarimetric raster scans of parts of
13 ARs, recorded between 09 May 2014 and 03 October 2017.
Columns denote the number we give to each dataset (i.e., scans
of the slit across the solar surface; column I), the ID of the scan
as used in the GRIS archive1 (column II), NOAA number of the
target regions (column III), the start - end time of the scan (col-
umn IV), the accumulation time per slit position to record one
full Stokes vector (column V), the step size of the scan (col-

umn VI), the average noise for the data binned over two spectral
pixels (average of the noise in Q, U, V; in units of Ic, which is
the continuum intensity; column VII), the heliocentric x (col-
umn VIII) and y (column IX) coordinates of the center of the
scanned ﬁeld-of-view (FOV), the cosine of the heliocentric an-
gle θ (µ = cos θ) of the AR (column X), the evolutionary stage
of the AR (EAR - emerging; DAR - decaying) at the time of the
scan (column XI) and whether the leading or the trailing part
of the AR was observed (column XII). A description of the ob-
served ARs and their intensity images are given in Appendix A.
The pixel size along the slit is 0.135(cid:48)(cid:48), and the step size chosen
for the scanning was set close to an integer multiple of this value
4). The number of accumulations and the exposure time
(

The observed spectral

region covers a range from
10823 to 10842 Å with a sampling of about 18 mÅ/pixel.
The He i 10830 Å triplet consists of
lines:
He ia at 10829.0911 Å, He ib at 10830.2501 Å, and He ic at
10830.3397 Å. He ib and He ic are blended as their wavelength
separation is smaller than their widths. In addition to the chro-
mospheric He i triplet, the two photospheric lines, Si i 10827 Å
and Ca i 10839 Å, and a telluric blend at 10832 Å are prominent
examples of the other lines present in the observed spectral re-
gion. Table 2 provides the parameters of all the spectral lines
identiﬁed on Fig. 1. The table distinguishes between the spectral
lines of solar origin and the telluric lines (which arise due to ab-
sorption in the Earth’s atmosphere). The lower (i) and the upper
( j) atomic terms involved in the transition, the eﬀective Landé
factor (geﬀ), the oscillator strength ( fi j) and the wavelength sep-
aration with respect to the He ic line (∆λ) in velocity units are
also provided in Table 2.

The dark current subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding, polarimetric cal-
ibration and cross-talk removal were done with the standard
GRIS data reduction software. The image resolution, calculated
by averaging the power spectrum along the slit direction, lies in
the range 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48)-0.8(cid:48)(cid:48). The diﬀraction limited resolution of GRE-
GOR at 10830 Å is 0.18(cid:48)(cid:48). However, due to the seeing conditions,
and non AO-corrected aberrations over the time of accumulating
one full Stokes vector (between 1.6 and 4 seconds) this reso-
lution could not be achieved. A spectral atlas obtained by the
Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS; Neckel & Labs 1984) at
the McMath-Pierce solar telescope on Kitt Peak was used for
the wavelength calibration and continuum correction. The con-
tinuum correction curve in the form of a polynomial, was ob-
tained by ﬁtting the FTS spectrum to the proﬁle computed from
the GRIS ﬂat ﬁeld images, excluding the telluric and the so-
lar lines. Wavelength oﬀset, dispersion, spectral resolution and
spectral straylight are among the free parameters of the ﬁtting
procedure. We remark that the reduction procedure still leaves
some residual fringes in Stokes I as can be seen in Fig. 1. These
fringes, however, do not aﬀect our analysis as they are far nar-
rower than the widths of solar spectral lines.

Intensity maps of each dataset at He ic line center and at a
continuum wavelength blueward of the Si i line are presented in
Appendix A. Note that some maps were recorded without the
image derotator installed at GREGOR and are therefore slightly
distorted. This is due to the image rotation during the scanning
period caused by the altitude-azimuth mount of the telescope.
In order to increase the S/N, all spectra were binned over two
spectral pixels. The noise for the Stokes polarization parameters
was computed as follows: we chose a wavelength region in the
continuum (blueward of the Si i 10827 Å line) and calculated the

standard deviation of the Stokes signals over wavelength for each
spatial pixel. The mean values of the standard deviations over
spatial pixels were calculated for each of the Stokes Q, U, and V
parameters and this mean was taken as the 1σ level. The noise
levels computed in this way for each dataset analyzed in this
paper are given in Table 1. For the analysis in this paper we have,
however, used the noise in the individual Stokes parameters.

Using the continuum images and line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), we tracked the evolution of the an-
alyzed ARs over three consecutive days (the day of observation
1 day). Based on the evolution of the size of the AR in the con-
±
tinuum images and appearance/disappearance of magnetic ele-
ments we classiﬁed the observed ARs into emerging (EAR) and
decaying (DAR; see column XI of Table 1).

2.2. Inversions

Thanks to the formation of the He i 10830 Å lines exclusively in
the upper chromosphere, new insights into the velocity and mag-
netic structure of the upper chromosphere have been obtained in
recent years using ground-based observations. Being formed in
a highly-corrugated layer, on average at about 2000 – 2400 km
above the visible solar surface (Avrett et al. 1994; Schmidt et al.
1994), the proﬁles of the He i 10830 Å triplet have almost no con-
tamination from photospheric light. This is due to the particular
formation mechanism of these lines. He i 10830 Å infrared lines
originate from transitions involving the triplet state of He (or-
thohelium). The majority of the He population lies in the singlet
state (parahelium) under normal chromospheric conditions leav-
ing the triplet state electron deprived. Photoionization from coro-
nal extreme ultra-violet (EUV) radiation from above and col-
lisional excitation ionizes the He atoms. The ionized He atoms
then recombine and de-excite with equal probability to either the
singlet or triplet state (Avrett et al. 1994; Lagg et al. 2017). Due
to the large density diﬀerence between the chromosphere and the

corona, the chromosphere is highly opaque to the coronal EUV
radiation. This restricts the photoionization and hence the He i
10830 Å triplet transitions to a thin layer at the top of the chro-
mosphere (e.g., Carlsson et al. 2016). Therefore, the physical
parameters within this layer can be assumed to be height inde-
pendent, which makes it possible to carry out radiative transfer
modeling in Milne-Eddington-type atmospheres.

To analyze the spectropolarimetric data chosen for our study,
we used the HeLIx+ inversion code (Lagg et al. 2004, 2009),
based on the Unno-Rachkowsky solution of the radiative transfer
equation. Line inversions were carried out in a Milne-Eddington-
type atmosphere taking into account the Zeeman eﬀect and the
incomplete Paschen–Back eﬀect (Socas-Navarro et al. 2005;
Sasso et al. 2006). Such inversions allow us to retrieve the full
magnetic vector and the LOS velocity in the upper chromosphere
where the He i 10830 Å triplet is formed. The Si i 10827 Å line
(formation height of the line core
500 km above the visible so-
lar surface; Shchukina et al. 2017) and the Ca i 10839 Å line (for-
mation height
150 km above the visible solar surface) are also
simultaneously inverted with HeLIx+ to obtain the magnetic ﬁeld
vector and LOS velocity in the upper and lower photosphere, re-
spectively. The He ia line overlaps with the broad wing of the
Si i line as seen in Fig. 1. It is therefore necessary to invert the
Si i and He i lines simultaneously in order to obtain reliable ﬁt to
the He lines. In a visual analysis of our sample, we did not ﬁnd
any supersonic downﬂows located far beyond the telluric line at
10832 Å. Therefore we excluded the wavelength region 10833 -
10838 Å from the ﬁt.

The free parameters of the inversion are: the magnetic ﬁeld
strength, B, the inclination of the magnetic ﬁeld to the LOS, γ,
and its azimuth, φ, the LOS velocity, vLOS (used interchangeably
with v throughout the paper), the damping constant, a, the ra-
tio of line-center-to-continuum opacity, η0, and the gradient of
the source function, S 1. A set of these 8 parameters constitute
an atmospheric component. A separate set of such parameters
is obtained for each layer of the atmosphere, i. e. for the up-
per chromosphere (from the He i triplet), the upper photosphere
(from the Si i line) and the lower photosphere (from the ca i line).
Fast downﬂows are often associated with a separate compo-
nent of the atmosphere that is nearly at rest within the same spa-
tial resolution element. Some examples of proﬁles where we see
two components in He i are shown in Fig. 1. To properly account
for the two coexisting atmospheric components, we inverted all
observed maps using two magnetized atmospheric components
(slow and fast) for the He i 10830 Å triplet. The slow and the fast
components have the same range of values for the free param-
eters except for the LOS velocity. The ﬁlling factor, α, denotes
the contribution from the fast component to the total observed
α is the contribution from the slow component.

The criteria we employ to distinguish the two components are
outlined in Sect. 2.4. In addition, we also inverted all data using a
single atmospheric component. We used this to test how well the
inversions using two atmospheric components agreed with the
one-component inversions for regions where no second compo-
nent is clearly visible or where the two components are not well
separated. We ﬁnd that in such cases the results for the compo-
nent with a larger ﬁlling factor in the two component inversions
agree well with those of the single component inversions. There-
fore, we use the parameters from the two component inversions
for all regions analyzed (see Sect. 2.4 for details).

−

The three He i lines, formed under identical conditions, re-
quire only one identical set of atmospheric parameters per com-
ponent (see Lagg et al. 2004, for further details). Beyond that

we ﬁxed the Doppler width for the He i lines in order to reduce
the number of free parameters. This increased the stability of the
minimization process without decreasing the quality of the ﬁt.
In addition to the two magnetized atmospheres for the He i lines,
a magnetized and a nonmagnetized component for the Si i line
and a magnetized component for the Ca i line were used. The
nonmagnetized component for the Si i line is needed to obtain
satisfactory ﬁts to the broad wings of the Si i line without con-
taminating the magnetic ﬁeld information obtained from the line
core. The telluric blend at 10832 Å was also ﬁtted using a Voigt
proﬁle.

We use the LOS velocity maps for the magnetized Si i com-
ponent to calibrate the velocities of the He i lines (see Sect. 2.4).
The calibration is performed by choosing a quiet Sun region
within each dataset and setting the mean velocity in this region
computed from the magnetic component of the Si i line to zero.

We deﬁne the slow component vLOS to lie within
10 km s−
around this zero velocity. This should ensure the slow compo-
nent to be subsonic and also exclude supersonic upﬂows, which
are not the subject of this paper. The fast component is deﬁned
to be strictly supersonic and takes vLOS values between 10 and
1. A visual inspection of the observed Stokes proﬁles
50 km s−

indicated that there are no downﬂows faster than 50 km s−
our sample and hence this value is chosen as the upper limit for
the fast component velocity.

±

The capabilities of the HeLIx+ code in terms of how well it
can ﬁt the observed Stokes proﬁles have been demonstrated in
earlier papers (e.g. Lagg et al. 2004, 2007; Sasso et al. 2011).
An example of the Stokes proﬁles synthesized by using two at-
mospheric components for the He i 10830 Å lines and how they
compare with the observed Stokes proﬁles is given in Fig. 2 for
the intensity proﬁle labeled 8 - 09jun16.004 in Fig. 1.

2.3. Classiﬁcation of the observed regions

At this point, we remark that two telluric lines are present
at wavelengths corresponding to velocity shifts of
36 and
1 from the He ic line (see Table 2). Even though the
48 km s−
HeLIx+ code takes the telluric lines into account, it is still pos-
sible that a second component is wrongly placed at the location
of the telluric line. For this reason, we do not trust the results
of the inversion when the supersonic downﬂow signature is seen
only in Stokes I and hence restrict our analysis to magnetized
supersonic downﬂows, where the polarized proﬁles unambigu-
ously identify the downﬂows to be solar.

∼

The magnetic ﬁeld expands rapidly with height, forming a
magnetic canopy in the lower to middle chromosphere (Gio-
vanelli & Jones 1982; Jones & Giovanelli 1982; Solanki &
Steiner 1990), so that by the height of formation of the He i
triplet, the magnetic ﬁeld ﬁlls the whole atmosphere and hence
all ﬂows are expected to be magnetized to some degree. A pre-
liminary investigation of the observed Stokes proﬁles indicates
that the magnetized supersonic downﬂows, which are the subject
of this paper, cover only a small fraction of the observed FOV. In
order to quantify the percentage of pixels that show magnetized
fast downﬂows in a given dataset, we need a reference parameter
that is independent of the size of the scanned region. The total
number of pixels in the observed FOV cannot be used as a refer-
ence as some datasets have dominantly AR (or a part of the AR)
in the FOV while a signiﬁcant part of the FOV of other scans
is covered by the quiet Sun where the magnetic ﬁeld is weak
and often is hard to detect in many of the pixels. Therefore, we
decided to classify the pixels in the FOV for each dataset into

A&A proofs: manuscript no. downﬂows

(Nprof) and the percentage of pixels classiﬁed to be magnetized
in the observed data are listed in columns II and III of Table 3.

In the observed Stokes proﬁles, the magnetic signals of the
slow and the fast components are often superimposed, especially
when the velocity separation between the two components is
small. This makes it challenging to distinctly identify the mag-
netic signals of the two components. In the inversions, however,
the synthetic proﬁles of the slow and the fast components are
computed separately and then combined to match the observed
proﬁles. It is therefore advantageous to use the synthetic pro-
ﬁles of the individual components to determine if their polarized
signals are suﬃciently above the noise or not. Making use of
the synthetic proﬁles and the σ of the observed Stokes param-
eters, we calculate the percentage of pixels with the parameter
MS > 2σ in a given dataset. These numbers are given in col-
umn IV of Table 3. We ﬁnd that the 3.5σ criterion for the ob-
served proﬁles to be classiﬁed as magnetized is similar to the 2σ
criterion for synthetic proﬁles (compare columns III and IV in
Table 3). It is clear from Table 3 that MS > 2σ gives a tighter
criterion (fewer pixels) than MO > 3.5σ. Observed proﬁles give
a larger percentage of magnetized pixels when we impose the
2σ criterion on them. This stringent 2σ threshold cannot be ap-
plied to the observed proﬁles, since under the assumption of a
Gaussian noise characteristics over the 63 measurement points
(21 points each for the Stokes Q, U, and V), it would mean that
virtually all pixels get classiﬁed as magnetized. With the advan-
tage of being able to separate the signals of the slow and the fast
components, the 3.5σ criterion on the observed proﬁles can be
replaced by the 2σ criterion on the synthetic proﬁles. According
to this scheme, all pixels with MS > 2σ are magnetized. The
pixels with MS ≤
Note that in Table 3 the percentage of proﬁles with MS > 2σ
in dataset 8 is much lower than those with MO > 3.5σ. This
diﬀerence is perhaps due to the pixels which show Stokes Q and
U signals, with either of them being just strong enough to satisfy
the MO > 3.5σ criterion (but with Stokes V close to the noise
level). Since the ﬁt to such proﬁles is poor, the Stokes Q and
U signals in the synthetic proﬁles do not meet the MS > 2σ
threshold. For this dataset, the MS > 2σ criterion turns out to be
similar to MO > 4σ.

2σ are not considered in our analysis.

2.4. Criteria for identiﬁcation of magnetized fast downﬂows

In some of the regions classiﬁed as ﬁeld-free (i.e. regions with
2σ as described in Sect. 2.3), supersonic velocities were
MS ≤
retrieved in the He i lines. They mostly correspond to regions
where the inversion code wrongly places a second He component
1. Some regions in
at the location of the telluric line at 48 km s−
the observed maps show fast magnetized downﬂows alone while
some others show their association with an additional compo-
nent almost at rest. In regions where we ﬁnd such dual ﬂows, we
applied the following criteria to the synthetic proﬁles in order to
identify the magnetized supersonic downﬂows:
a) the two components must be separated suﬃciently well from
each other. Therefore, we require the fast component to be
1 relative to the slow compo-
shifted by more than 10 km s−
nent and the fast component velocity should be greater than
10 km s−

1 (supersonic);

b) the ﬁlling factors of each of the two components must be at

least 20 % for this to be classiﬁed as a dual ﬂow;

c) the peak value of any of the three synthetic Stokes parame-
0.36 Å centered at the fast
ters
component position must be larger than a given threshold in
σ(V)).

ization level lower than 3.5σ in the observed Stokes Q, U, and
V in the slow component of He i. A similar approach was used
by Aznar Cuadrado et al. (2007). This categorization will enable
us to quantify how many of the pixels magnetized in the slow
He component also display a magnetized supersonic downﬂow
component.

Fig. 3. Results of the two component inversions of the He i lines for AR 12552 observed on 09 June 2016 (dataset 8). Panels (a)–(c) represent the
normalized intensities at 10825 Å and at He ic line center wavelengths, and Stokes V/Ic map at 10826.89 Å, respectively. The LOS velocity, the
strength and the inclination of the magnetic ﬁeld are presented in panels (d)–(f) for the slow and in panels (g)–(i) for the supersonic components.
The contours mark the boundaries of sunspots and pores, determined using the continuum intensity image shown in panel (a). These contours
enclose regions within 85 % level of the surrounding quiet Sun intensity in the continuum image. The arrows in panel (a) indicate solar north and
east directions. The azimuths of the magnetic ﬁeld are over-plotted as lines in panels (d) and (g). See Sect. 3 for further details.

In observations where fast magnetized downﬂows existed
with another component having a ﬁlling factor less than 20 %
we checked only for the last criterion listed above. The require-
ment imposed on the magnetic signal (criterion c) ensures that
unmagnetized supersonic downﬂows (which may be aﬀected by
the telluric lines as discussed above) are excluded from our anal-
ysis.

The number of proﬁles in each dataset identiﬁed to have
magnetized supersonic downﬂows (Nsd), using the criteria out-
lined above, is given in column V of Table 3. Column VI gives
the fraction of pixels with clear chromospheric magnetic signals

also display a supersonic downﬂow for each dataset. The max-
imum velocities of the magnetized supersonic downﬂows are
given in column VII. Column VIII represents the mean and the
standard deviation of these supersonic velocities.

dataset 8. A detailed analysis of the downﬂows in dataset 3
from 17 June 2014, which shows a He i ﬁlament associated with
AR 12087 is presented in Sowmya et al. (2020). The statistical
properties of such downﬂows in all the regions analyzed are dis-
cussed in Sect. 4.

The dataset 8 was observed on 09 June 2016. It consists of
the scan of AR 12552 and the scan lasted for about 35 minutes
starting at 07:53 UT, while the AR was still emerging on the
northwestern side of the visible hemisphere. The scan covers
about 47(cid:48)(cid:48) in the scan direction (x-axis) and 64(cid:48)(cid:48) along the slit
(y-axis), with a step size of 0.135(cid:48)(cid:48) and a pixel size of 0.135(cid:48)(cid:48)
along the slit. The center of the FOV corresponds to a helio-
centric angle of 42° (µ = 0.74, x = +573(cid:48)(cid:48) and y = +254(cid:48)(cid:48), see
Table 1). Panels (a)–(c) in Fig. 3 show intensity maps at 10825 Å
in the local continuum, at 10830.3 Å (He ic), and Stokes V/Ic at
10826.9 Å, respectively. A sunspot group is visible in the con-
tinuum intensity image, along with pores. The following posi-
tive polarity (purple patch in Fig. 3c) has formed into a single
sunspot whereas the leading negative polarity (brown patch in
Fig. 3c) has fragmented into four spots whose penumbrae are
still forming. An arcade of loops connecting opposite polarities
(forming a so-called AFS) is visible in the He ic intensity image.
A small patch where He i goes into emission is seen on the lower
right of Fig. 3b. We exclude these pixels from our analysis as the
inversion was not optimized to ﬁt emission proﬁles.

The results of the two-component inversions are shown in
panels (d)–(i) in Fig. 3. The LOS velocity, the magnetic ﬁeld
strength, and the inclination of the magnetic ﬁeld for the slow
component are shown in panels (d)–(f). Panels (g)–(i) show, re-
spectively, the LOS velocity, the magnetic ﬁeld strength and the
inclination of the magnetic ﬁeld for the fast component at only
those locations where the presence of supersonic downﬂows was
inferred using the conservative criteria outlined in Sect. 2.4. The
contours mark the boundaries of sunspots and pores seen in the
continuum intensity map in panel (a). These photospheric con-
tours are obtained by setting a threshold of 85 % of the surround-
ing quiet Sun intensity in the continuum intensity map (see also
Appendix A). The magnetic ﬁeld azimuths are over-plotted as
black lines in panels (d) and (g). All maps have been smoothed
with a median ﬁlter, for representation purposes.

The loop tops show subsonic blue shifts in the LOS veloc-
ity as seen in panel (d), indicating that the loops are rising and
transporting relatively cool material from the surface to the chro-
mosphere. Magnetized supersonic downﬂows are found to exist
at the footpoints of the loops (see panel g). These downﬂows

downﬂows ﬁll only a small fraction of the observed FOV (com-
pare panels d and g). Out of the 58 % of pixels in the FOV which
are classiﬁed as magnetized, only 4.65 % show the presence of
a supersonic downﬂow component (see columns V and VI of
Table 3). The magnetic vector of the slow and the fast compo-
nents are slightly diﬀerent in regions where the fast component is
found. The chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld strengths correspond-
ing to the slow and fast components peak at 641 and 458 G,
respectively (with the corresponding median values of 629 and
527 G). The chromospheric LOS inclinations peak at 59 and 68°
for the slow and the fast components (the corresponding median
values are 54 and 55°).

4. Properties of magnetized supersonic downﬂows

In our analysis with two component inversions, we identiﬁed
both single component magnetized supersonic downﬂows (with
the slow component having a ﬁlling factor below 20 %, which
typically means that it is hardly visible above the noise) and su-
personic downﬂows which coexist with a subsonic component
(which can be an upﬂow or a downﬂow). In the following, we
discuss the properties of such ﬂows.

4.1. Frequency of occurrence

As discussed in Sect. 2.4, the number of proﬁles exhibiting mag-
netized supersonic downﬂows and their fraction with respect to
the total number of magnetized pixels in the FOV are given in
Table 3 (columns V and VI). Recall that to determine whether
a pixel is magnetized we require MS > 2σ. There are, in total,
13466 proﬁles from the 14 scans displaying magnetized super-

K. Sowmya et al.: Magnetized supersonic downﬂows in the chromosphere

sonic downﬂows. Of these, 1067 (
8 %) are single component
proﬁles i.e. the overwhelming majority of supersonic downﬂows
are associated with a component close to rest. Although the area
coverages are small (0.2
6.4 %), we ﬁnd supersonic downﬂows
associated with magnetic ﬁelds in all ARs studied, indicating
that they are a common phenomenon in ARs.

−

∼

It is apparent from Table 3 that the relative area covered
by magnetized supersonic downﬂows is higher in EARs than
in DARs (marked with (cid:63) in column I of Table 3). Nine EARs
in our sample account for 91.8 % (Nsd=12366) of the total pro-
ﬁles with magnetized supersonic downﬂows, while ﬁve DARs
together contribute to only 8.2 % (Nsd=1100) of such proﬁles
(we note that this lower fraction could also partly be due to the
fewer number of scans of DARs). Overall, the area covered by
supersonic downﬂow-hosting pixels is only 1.78 % and 0.19 %
of the area of the EARs and DARs, respectively. This conﬁrms
that supersonic downﬂows are indeed much more common in
EARs than in DARs.

One of the 13 ARs in our sample, namely AR 12567 (datasets
9 and 10), was observed more than once i.e. at diﬀerent times
during its emergence on the same day. We notice a decrease in
the area covered by fast downﬂows with increasing age of this
AR.

4.2. Associated solar features

The supersonic downﬂows are found in association with several
solar features. In Table 4, we provide a classiﬁcation of the fast
downﬂow proﬁles based on the photospheric and chromospheric
structures where they occur (column I). Pores, sunspot umbrae,
sunspot penumbrae, and sunspot light bridges are identiﬁed us-
ing the continuum intensity images while the plage regions are
identiﬁed with the help of Si i Stokes V maps. He i loops (or
AFS) and ﬁlaments (suspended above the polarity inversion line)
are the chromospheric structures deduced from He ic line center
intensity images (see Figs. A.1–A.4). The number of supersonic
downﬂow proﬁles (Nsd) belonging to each of these solar features
is given in column II. Column III shows what fraction of the
total 13466 proﬁles displaying a supersonic downﬂow compo-
nent is ascribed to a particular solar feature. Column IV gives
the numbers of all datasets where ﬂows in a given solar feature
are identiﬁed.

As far as the photospheric structures are concerned, about
53 % of the locations displaying supersonic downﬂows are found
in the periphery of pores (e.g. dataset 4), sunspot umbrae and
penumbrae together account for 34 % (e.g. dataset 14) and about
3 % end up over light bridges (e.g. dataset 9). Slightly over 10 %
of the supersonic downﬂows appear at seemingly quiet regions
in the continuum intensity images, some of which are in immedi-
ate vicinity of ARs (e.g. dataset 1). The strong Stokes V signals
in the Si i line at their locations indicate that they are AR plage.
In the chromosphere, more than 91 % of the supersonic down-
ﬂows are found in association with He i 10830 Å loops (as in
dataset 8 where both footpoints of the loops are clearly visible
or as in dataset 11 where only one footpoint of a loop is seen in
the FOV). 12 out of the 14 datasets contribute to this category.
These supersonic downﬂows lie along and at the footpoints of
the loops, with the velocity increasing toward the footpoints. He i
10830 Å ﬁlaments (e.g. dataset 3) contribute to nearly 3 % of the
observed supersonic downﬂows, and are mostly seen along the
ﬁlament barbs, with increasing velocities away from the spine.
A few supersonic downﬂows in seven of the datasets, which
amount to the remaining 6 %, could not be clearly assigned to

any structure and hence are grouped under the category "others".
According to this classiﬁcation, the majority of the fast down-
ﬂows are located at the sites identiﬁed as pores and sunspots
belonging to regions of emerging magnetic ﬂux (EARs). This is
in accordance with the inference that EARs host most of the fast
downﬂows.

Moreover, a very crude calculation indicates that the to-
tal area covered by the supersonic downﬂow hosting pixels in
pores are about 29.4 % of the total pixels covered by pores in
9 datasets. This fraction is about 1.7 % for the penumbrae in 9
datasets, 1.3 % for umbrae in 4 datasets, 8.2 % for light bridges
in 2 datasets and 0.38 % for plages in 10 datasets. Further, for
the He i loops in 12 datasets and ﬁlaments in 2 datasets, these
fractions turn out to be 2.46 % and 2.3 %, respectively. These
estimates are biased since only those datasets which display su-
personic downﬂows in a given category are used to determine
the area covered by a given AR feature. Nevertheless, it is clear
that supersonic downﬂows span only a tiny fraction of an AR
feature’s area, with the highest fraction being in pores.

they occur. The upper part of the table identiﬁes photospheric features,

4.3. LOS velocity distribution

The LOS velocity maps for the slow component are shown in
Figs. A.1–A.4 (see also Fig. 3). The maps have been smoothed
with a median ﬁlter for better representation. One of the apparent
features that one can notice are the alternate red and blueshifts in
the LOS velocity maps for the slow component in sunspots, for
instance, as in datasets 1, 12, 13, and 14. These velocity oscilla-
tions (captured by the temporal scanning) are visible both in the
umbra and penumbra (see e.g. Bloomﬁeld et al. 2007). We note
that such velocity oscillations are not seen in the fast compo-
nent. Such a case where the slow component shows oscillations
while the fast component does not, was discussed by Brynild-
sen et al. (2001b) for ﬂows in the sunspot transition region (TR)
which led them to suggest that the two components originate at
diﬀerent heights in the solar atmosphere (see further discussions
in Sect. 5.2).

Figure 4a shows the normalized histograms of the LOS ve-
locities of the subsonic ﬂows at pixels classiﬁed as magnetized
(column IV of Table 3) which do not host supersonic downﬂows.
The distributions in Fig. 4a are well ﬁt by the Gaussian functions

Figure 5b shows the velocity distribution of the supersonic
downﬂows located in the periphery of pores. More than half of
the observed supersonic ﬂows lie in this category and are mostly
constituted by the large fraction of downﬂows in datasets 2, 4 and
8. Dataset 4 displays the fastest of all the observed supersonic

downﬂows in our sample with LOS velocities up to 49.2 km s−
(see column VII of Table 3). The overall distribution of the LOS
velocities appears very similar to that in Fig. 5a. The velocities of
the supersonic ﬂows ending in penumbrae (a great part of which
comes from dataset 8 alone) also show a distribution similar to
those in pores, however with the ﬁrst and the second populations
being equally strong (Fig. 5c).

When the downﬂow proﬁles are grouped into those from
EARS (consisting of 9 datasets; Fig. 6a) and DARs (consisting
of 5 datasets; Fig. 6b), we obtain a distribution with multiple
populations which resembles that of Fig. 5a for EARs while for
the DARs, the distribution appears to consist of a single popu-
lation with continuous LOS velocity values. To check if there
is any dependence of the downﬂow velocities on the leading or
trailing part of the ARs, we classiﬁed the observed regions into
leading and trailing groups using the LOS magnetograms from
HMI (Table 1, column XII). There are two datasets containing
both the leading and trailing polarities. For these cases, we sep-
arated the proﬁles from trailing and leading polarities using the
LOS magnetic ﬁeld strength maps (B cos γ) created from our in-
version code output. The velocity distribution for the leading and
trailing groups are shown in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 6. In both
groups, the distributions peak at nearly the same velocities, sug-
gesting that the multiple populations in the downﬂow velocities
are independent of whether the downﬂows are found in the lead-
ing or trailing side of the AR.

ers" (Fig. 7c) for which the associated structure was unclear if
we consider just images taken in the core of the He ic line, ap-
pear to be a combination of the distributions seen for plage and
umbrae. Dataset 12, that shows downﬂows in this category was
previously studied by Verma et al. (2018). The locations of the
supersonic downﬂows we derived are consistent with the loca-
tions where Verma et al. (2018) reported strong downﬂows in
He i using a single Lorentzian ﬁt.

Finally, we note that to our knowledge this study forms
the ﬁrst comprehensive statistical analysis of the chromospheric
magnetized supersonic downﬂows. However, since the statistics
are small in the sense that relatively few ARs were analyzed, the
relative number of supersonic downﬂows in each category dis-
cussed above should be taken with caution.

4.4. Magnetic ﬁeld

In the regions where supersonic downﬂows occur, He i 10830 Å
lines mostly show polarization signals indicative of the Zee-
man eﬀect suggesting that the magnetic ﬁeld strengths in those
regions are beyond the Hanle sensitivity regime. However, in
datasets 7 and 8, polarization signals in Q and U depicting the
modiﬁcation of scattering polarization by the magnetic ﬁeld via
the Hanle eﬀect (see e.g. Trujillo Bueno et al. 2002; Lagg et al.
2004; Asensio Ramos et al. 2008, for a discussion of the Hanle
eﬀect in He i 10830 Å triplet) are noticeable at a very few pixels
which harbour supersonic downﬂows close to the footpoints of
He i loops. In our sample of 13 AR scans, the linear polariza-
tion signals due to Hanle eﬀect are also found in pixels which
do not host supersonic downﬂows (notably in He i loop tops).
We remark that the Hanle eﬀect is not included in our inversions
and the few proﬁles showing Hanle eﬀect are still treated under
the approximation of the Zeeman eﬀect. The fraction of super-
sonic downﬂow-hosting pixels that also exhibit Hanle signatures
is less than 1 % of the total number of pixels with supersonic
downﬂows. Therefore the inﬂuence of this approximation on the
statistical results presented here is negligible.

In Figure 8, we show the distributions of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength for photospheric structures at only those pixels
where both, supersonic downﬂows (red histograms) and sub-
sonic up/downﬂows (black histograms) coexist. There are in to-
tal 12399 such pixels. Panels (a)–(f) show these histograms for
the various solar structures indicated in the titles of these panels.
Ntc gives the total number of two-component proﬁles in each
category. The number of proﬁles in each panel is reduced from
the corresponding ones in Fig. 5 as we have excluded the 1067
proﬁles showing only fast downﬂow with supersonic velocities
(i.e., without a coexisting slow component). The mean value of
the ﬁeld strength and standard deviation of the distribution are
given in black for the slow component and in red for the fast
component. When all the 12399 proﬁles are considered together
(panel a), on average the magnetic ﬁeld has a strength of about
530 G in the fast component whereas it is stronger by approxi-
mately 50 G in the slow component. The distribution, however,
is similar in the two components. In the pore vicinity, penum-
brae and umbrae, the subsonic component is associated with
somewhat stronger ﬁelds (by 10
200 G on average). On the
whole, the result that the slow and fast components have diﬀer-
ent ﬁeld strengths is consistent with the ﬁndings of Lagg et al.
(2007). Chromospheres above sunspot umbrae have the high-
est mean ﬁeld strength of all the analyzed structures, showing
2 kG at the locations of supersonic downﬂows. In light bridges

The magnetic ﬁeld strength distributions of the two compo-

The characteristics of the distributions in He i loops are simi-

For an accurate determination of the inclination of the mag-
netic ﬁeld vector, the linear polarization signals should stay well
above the noise level. We ﬁnd that the majority of the proﬁles
associated with strong downﬂows exhibit very weak linear po-
larization signals which lie below the noise threshold. To deter-
mine supersonic downﬂows discussed here we set the require-
ment that one of the three Stokes polarization parameters is suf-
ﬁciently above the noise. To not bias the results too much by
excluding a large number of spatial pixels, we set the same re-

In Fig. 10, we show the distribution of the inclination for
the slow (black) and fast (red) components for regions observed
close to the disk center (µ > 0.9). The LOS inclinations retrieved
from the inversions are closer to the true inclination of the mag-
netic ﬁeld when the regions are observed close to the disk center.
For regions observed away from the disk center, the interpreta-
tion of the ﬁeld inclination is not straightforward without the
LOS azimuth disambiguation. Hence we restrict the analysis of
magnetic ﬁeld inclination only to the near disk center cases. In
the inversions, the inclination takes values in the range between
0° – 90° for positive polarity and between 90° – 180° for the
negative polarity. For the purpose of Fig. 10, the inclination val-
ues between 90° – 180° have been folded on to the range 90°
– 0°. For the slow component, about 59 % of 5001 proﬁles give
inclination below 45° (which is already evident from the mean
and median values of the distributions). This suggests that the
magnetic ﬁeld is more vertical with respect to the solar surface
in the regions where the slow component originates. The mag-
netic ﬁelds associated with the supersonic downﬂows appear to
be more horizontal. About 56 % of the 5001 proﬁles result in in-
clination values higher than 45° (with a median value of
48°).
This diﬀerence in the inclination distribution for the slow and
the fast components, is consistent with the ﬁndings of Lagg et al.
(2007).

∼

In their studies with the quiet Sun data, Borrero & Kobel
(2011, 2012) pointed out that inversions tend to retrieve more
horizontal ﬁelds when the polarization signals are weak, ow-
ing to the inﬂuence of photon noise. To determine if the more
horizontal ﬁeld inclinations retrieved for the fast component is
due to weaker magnetic signals in them compared to the ones
in the slow component, we did a test. For this we selected all
pixels where the two components had similar ﬁlling factors and
checked the distributions of the ﬁeld inclination for the two com-
ponents. Even when the magnetic signals are equally strong in
the two components, we found that the ﬁeld for the fast com-
ponent is more horizontal than for the slow component. All in

the third, i.e. fastest population is not seen in the velocity dis-
tribution for features like light bridge, plage, and ﬁlaments and
hence cannot be arising from the telluric blend. The magnetic
nature of the supersonic downﬂows analyzed ensures that the ar-
tifacts due to telluric line are removed, since the telluric line does
not have any magnetic signal of its own.

∼

A possible explanation for the broad range of downﬂow ve-
locities seen for the AFS loops might come from the diﬀerences
in the heights of the loops hosting supersonic downﬂows. The
ARs showing AFS loops are likely at diﬀerent phases of emer-
gence, with loops on average at diﬀerent heights. The gravita-
tional acceleration results in this case in diﬀerent velocities at the
footpoints with high lying loops showing higher velocities. See
González Manrique et al. (2018) for a description of the tem-
poral evolution of the LOS velocities in an arch ﬁlament dur-
ing its lifetime. However, it remains unclear why there are three
distinct ppopulations. Lastly, we remark that such multiple pop-
ulations in fast downﬂow velocities were also reported in Az-
nar Cuadrado et al. (2007), who analysed 35 scans of 13 ARs
recorded using the German Vacuum Tower Telescope and de-
termined the LOS velocities using the multiGaussian ﬁt to the

5.2. Origin of magnetized supersonic downﬂows

Several scenarios have been put forward in the literature to ex-
plain the origin of highly redshifted ﬂows. Here, we discuss the
possible mechanisms behind the supersonic downﬂows that we
observed in various AR features.

Many datasets in our sample show rapid chromospheric
downﬂows in the vicinity of pores located at the footpoints of
He i loops, similar to the ones studied by Lagg et al. (2007). In
fact, the fastest downﬂows are seen around pores i.e. relatively
cool structures harbouring strong magnetic ﬁelds. The lower
temperature leads to a reduction in the pressure scale height and
reduces the gas pressure at a given height. Increased magnetic
ﬁeld concentration leads to an enhancement in the Wilson de-
pression. Following Lagg et al. (2007), the association of fast
downﬂows with pores could be explained by the small pressure
scale height, which leads to a stronger evacuation of the ﬂux
tube at the footpoint of the loop, at least for heights at which the
temperature is lower than in the surroundings. Because of this
the cooler material carried by the He i loop can travel down to a
larger distance before it hits gas at a given density or pressure,
attaining higher velocities in the process. If the pore is forming
and the ﬁeld is increasing, then the convective collapse of the
photospheric ﬂux tube removes the hydrostatic support of the
chromospheric plasma, causing the gas in the photospheric lay-
ers of the pore to ﬂow down as well (e.g. Parker 1978; Spruit
1979; Grossmann-Doerth et al. 1998).

Supersonic downﬂows seen above sunspots could be the
chromospheric counterparts of TR supersonic downﬂows. Mul-
ticomponent ﬂows within a resolution element are a well-known
observational features of TR spectral lines. Localized super-
sonic downﬂows above sunspots were in fact ﬁrst seen in the
TR spectral lines observed with the High-Resolution Telescope
and Spectrograph by Dere (1982); Kjeldseth-Moe et al. (1988);
Brekke et al. (1990); Kjeldseth-Moe et al. (1993). These au-
thors ascribed such multiple ﬂows to the ﬁne structure of the TR
i.e. to the presence of multiple ﬁbrils within a given resolution
element. In the observations by the Solar Ultraviolet Measure-
ments of Emitted Radiation instrument (SUMER; Wilhelm et al.
1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO),
Brynildsen et al. (2001b) found dual ﬂows. The low speed com-
ponent showed clear association with the umbral oscillations
while the faster one did not, suggesting that the two components
are formed at diﬀerent heights along the LOS (see also Brynild-
sen et al. 2004). The data from the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS) also revealed the presence of steady (e.g.
Straus et al. 2015) as well as bursty, shot-lived (e.g. Kleint et al.
2014) supersonic downﬂows above sunspots (see also Nelson
et al. 2020). Samanta et al. (2018) carried out a statistical anal-
ysis of the TR supersonic downﬂows in 60 sunspot datasets ob-
served by IRIS and found that in more than 40 % of the cases,
the TR supersonic downﬂows exhibited chromospheric super-
sonic downﬂows. This points to a possibility that some spots
in our sample probably show the chromospheric equivalents of
TR supersonic downﬂows. It is also possible that some of the
downﬂows that we observe are associated with sunspot plumes
(Brynildsen et al. 2001a,b).

Evershed eﬀect refers to the horizontally outward ﬂow of gas
observed in the penumbral ﬁlaments at the photosphere (Ever-
shed 1909). A reversed ﬂow called the inverse Evershed ﬂow
is seen in the chromosphere (Maltby 1975; Solanki 2003, and
references therein). For the sunspot observed in dataset 1, most
of the supersonic downﬂows are on the side of the spot show-

K. Sowmya et al.: Magnetized supersonic downﬂows in the chromosphere

ing redshifts due to the inverse Evershed ﬂow (see LOS velocity
map in Fig. A.1).

Louis et al. (2009) reported photospheric supersonic down-
ﬂows in a sunspot light bridge using measurements taken with
the spectropolarimeter onboard the Hinode satellite. They found
the supersonic downﬂows to be located at regions where the
magnetic ﬁeld of the light bridge meets the sunspot ﬁeld having
a diﬀerent orientation, and to be co-spatial with the brightenings
seen in the chromospheric Ca ii H ﬁltergrams. They speculated
these supersonic downﬂows to be the result of the magnetic re-
connection happening in the upper photosphere/lower chromo-
sphere. In two datasets in our sample, supersonic downﬂows are
seen above sunspot light bridges, many of which seem to be lo-
cated near the footpoints of the He i loops anchored in the light
bridges. The ﬂow velocity appears to increase toward the foot-
points, indicating plasma motion along the loops, similar to that
seen for pores. Further, brightenings in the corona as sampled by

nection, are seen in the case of dataset 5. Hence, the possibil-
ity that the small fraction of supersonic downﬂows above light
bridge which are not associated with He i loops arise from mag-
netic reconnection in the corona cannot be ruled out.

Schmidt et al. (2000) detected downﬂows with supersonic
velocities in the He i 10830 Å lines in addition to a component
nearly at rest, in a plage region close to a pore observed with
the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The inﬂowing material
2. They interpreted
exhibited a constant acceleration of 200 ms−
this constant acceleration as a free-fall of the matter either unob-
structed by magnetic structures or along vertical ﬁeld lines, from
the height of formation of He i toward the photosphere. We see
a signiﬁcant fraction of the supersonic downﬂows to be associ-
ated with plage regions. More than half of these are located in
the plage regions anchored at the footpoints of He i loops and
ﬁlament barbs, and show a smooth increase in the ﬂow velocity
toward the footpoints while the rest appear scattered. The chro-
mospheric structure associated with these scattered downﬂows
could not be identiﬁed.

The downﬂows in loops or AFS are usually interpreted to be
due to the draining of the plasma from the emerging ﬂux tubes
(Chou 1993; Solanki et al. 2003; Lagg et al. 2007; Xu et al.
2010; Balthasar et al. 2016; González Manrique et al. 2018).
Gravity and collisions with ionized particles cause the neutral
He i 10830 Å gas to drain along the magnetic ﬁeld lines toward
the surface. A pictorial representation of this phenomena is pre-
sented in Fig. 13 of Xu et al. (2010) and in Fig. 15 of González
Manrique et al. (2018). In dataset 8, which shows an arcade of
loops in the He ic line center image, the downﬂows are clearly
seen to follow the loops. Upﬂows with subsonic velocities are
seen at the loop tops for the slow component (see Fig. 3). Faster
downﬂows are seen closer to the footpoints suggesting gravita-
tional acceleration of the material as it falls along the loop. In one
of the loops, an asymmetry in the downﬂow velocities is clearly
visible. Flow velocities are higher in one footpoint compared to
the other. Such asymmetries were reported by González Man-
rique et al. (2020) and they attribute it to the diﬀerence in the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld strength at the two footpoints (see
also Spadaro et al. 2004; Lagg et al. 2007). In accordance with
them, we ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld at the level of the photo-
sphere derived from Si i maps, is stronger at the footpoint show-
ing faster downﬂows compared to the other footpoint hosting
slower downﬂows. Even in the DARs, for example in datasets
5 and 6, the loops hosting strong downﬂows at the footpoints

show upﬂows in their apex and downﬂows at footpoints in the
slow component (see third and fourth rows in Fig. A.2). These
signatures are in concordance with the ﬁndings of Solanki et al.
(2003); Lagg et al. (2007); González Manrique et al. (2018).
Thus, we interpret the fast downﬂows in loops to be a conse-
quence of magnetic ﬂux emergence.

One of the other proposed mechanisms for the supersonic
downﬂows is the siphon ﬂow mechanism along the loop either
due to asymmetric heating (e.g., Brynildsen et al. 2001a) or due
to magnetic ﬁeld strength diﬀerences (e.g., Rüedi et al. 1992) be-
tween the footpoints. In dataset 8, where both the footpoints of
the AFS are clearly visible, downﬂows were seen at both ends,
eliminating siphon ﬂow as their cause (siphon ﬂow would re-
sult in upﬂows at one footpoint and downﬂows at the other).
As demonstrated by Montesinos & Thomas (1989); Thomas &
Montesinos (1990) siphon ﬂow in an isolated arched ﬂux tube
can undergo a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic
speed at the top of the arch. In other datasets where we see fast
downﬂows at the footpoints of the partly observed loops, siphon
ﬂow driven at the other footpoint that is unobserved (e.g. as re-
ported in Chitta et al. 2016) could be another channel through
which the ﬂows become supersonic.

Consequently, the favoured mechanism proposed for the su-
personic downﬂows in He loops in AFS is that proposed by Lagg
et al. (2007). Given the much larger statistics, we can now distin-
guish between their scenarios 1 and 2 (i.e. uncombed and cloud
models), which they introduced to explain the coexistence of
two magnetic components within a single spatial element. The
fact that the ﬁeld associated with the slow component in He
loops is generally stronger and more vertical than the ﬁeld as-
sociated with the fast component indicates that the slow com-
ponent is formed below the fast component, where the ﬁeld of
a loop is expected to be stronger and more vertical. In between
the two there is likely to be a shock, as illustrated in Fig. 11. Evi-
dence for shocks has also been found in some of the datasets that
we analyzed. We identiﬁed a few proﬁles near one of the foot-
points where He i exhibits weak emission, indicating heating at
the footpoints. This emission could possibly be a manifestation
of a shock (Lagg et al. 2007). However, we did not optimize the
inversions to ﬁt the emission proﬁles and they were excluded
from our analysis. Hence we cannot comment if there were su-
personic ﬂows in regions where heating was observed.

A He i 10830 Å ﬁlament is visible in dataset 3 (this dataset
has been discussed in detail in Sowmya et al. 2020). The fast
1 (see
downﬂows in this ﬁlament reach velocities of over 35 km s−
top panels in Fig. A.2). Mass ﬂow in ﬁlaments along the spine
and barbs have been identiﬁed in Hα observations (e.g. Zirker
1
et al. 1998; Joshi et al. 2013). Redshifted ﬂows up to 11 km s−
at sites where the barbs connect to the ﬁlament spine have been
reported in Joshi et al. (2013). Panasenco et al. (2013) argue that
the barbs are often rooted in the intersection of about 4
5 super-
granular cells where photospheric convective motions turn into
downdrafts. Following these authors, we interpret the fast down-
ﬂows seen in the ﬁlament to be due to the mass motion along
the ﬁlament barbs. The gravitational acceleration of the material
as it falls along the barb then leads to an increase in the ﬂow
velocities away from the spine.

−

Multiple ﬂows are often also found in connection with ﬂares
(e.g., Teriaca et al. 2003). There were no signs of eruptions or of
any associated ﬂares at the time the analyzed ARs were scanned,
ruling out the association of these downﬂows with, e.g., coronal
rain, i.e., material falling back toward the solar surface after a
(possibly failed) eruption.

the probability of observing strong downﬂows is higher during
the emergence phase of an AR’s evolution as emerging loops rise
into the upper atmosphere and the material they are dragging up
with them drains out. Nevertheless, the fact that such ﬂows are
seen in all ARs including those in the decay phase, leads us to
conclude that magnetized supersonic downﬂows are a common
phenomena in the upper chromospheric layers of ARs.

Supersonic downﬂows are found in association with AR fea-
tures such as pores (especially forming pores), sunspot umbrae,
sunspot penumbrae, light bridges, plages, He i loops (arch ﬁla-
ments) and ﬁlaments. The maximum value of the fast compo-

LOS velocities of the supersonic downﬂows form a broad distri-
1. Such multiple
bution with three peaks at 14, 28, and 40 km s−
distributions are also individually exhibited by the downﬂows in
pores, penumbrae and He i loops. It is not clear if these peaks
are produced by insuﬃcient statistics or are more fundamental.
In the majority of the cases (92 %), the supersonic downﬂows
coexists with a second subsonic component in the same reso-
lution element. The associated magnetic ﬁeld strengths of the
two components show similar distributions. However, the mean
ﬁeld strength is somewhat higher in the slow ﬂow component.
The inclinations suggest that the magnetic ﬁeld is more vertical
with respect to the solar surface for the subsonic component. Al-
though the diﬀerence in the ﬁeld strength and inclination for the
two components seem to suggest that they have a diﬀerent origin
due to the magnetic ﬁne structure of the upper chromosphere, in
agreement with the ﬁndings of Lagg et al. (2007), the inclina-
tions should be treated with caution due to the weakness of the
linear polarization signals involved.

The mechanism driving these supersonic downﬂows appears
to be manifold. A signiﬁcant fraction of the supersonic down-
ﬂows seem to be resulting from the draining of the material
that is transported by the rising ﬂux tubes from the solar inte-
rior to higher layers. Mass ﬂow along barbs are responsible for
the supersonic downﬂows in ﬁlaments. Condensation and siphon
ﬂow of the coronal mass, inverse Evershed ﬂow, free-fall of the
spicule material cold be other drivers of these strong downﬂows.
It is possible that some of the observed supersonic downﬂows
are chromospheric equivalents of the TR supersonic downﬂows.
We also observed downﬂows for which the underlying physical
cause could not be inferred. Further analysis with ARs observed
in many layers of the solar atmosphere is necessary to understand
this intriguing phenomenon and its relation to ﬂows in other lay-
ers of the solar atmosphere.

personic downﬂows were found in the analyzed ARs, illustrated here
for a positive magnetic polarity pore.

Finally, as mentioned earlier, we do ﬁnd a small fraction
(
8 %) of supersonic downﬂows without a coexisting slow com-
∼
ponent. This ﬁnding hints at a scenario pointed out by Schmidt
et al. (2000) where the downﬂowing gas, present above the atmo-
sphere where the slow component originates, pulls the slow com-
ponent down during its fall. For all the remaining cases where
both the slow and the fast components exist in the same res-
olution element, the ﬁlamentary structure of the chromosphere
discussed by Lagg et al. (2007) appears plausible.

6. Summary and conclusions

In this study, we extract some characteristics of magnetized su-
personic downﬂows making use of the 14 spectropolarimetric
observations of parts of 13 ARs in the He i 10830 Å triplet. These
data are analyzed with the help of LOS velocity and magnetic
ﬁeld vector maps obtained by applying an inversion technique
based on a multicomponent Milne-Eddington type atmospheric
model. Using a set of conservative criteria, we separate the ar-
eas hosting supersonic downﬂows from the rest of the observed
patch in each of the 14 scans. These areas are studied in detail
to extract the properties of the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds in
the upper chromosphere in a thin layer where the He i 10830 Å
triplet forms.

Magnetized supersonic downﬂows are found to be anchored
in all the 13 ARs, although their area coverages are only a small
fraction (0.2–6.4 %) of the total area of the magnetized regions
in the FOV. Factors such as the evolutionary phase of the AR and
the quiet Sun content in the FOV of the scan inﬂuence the per-
centage of strong downﬂows that one can observe. For instance,

Appendix A: Description of the ARs and location of downﬂows

Figs. A.1–A.4 show the raster scans of parts of all the 13 ARs in the continuum (at 10825 Å) and He ic line center wavelengths,
along with the LOS velocity maps for the slow He i component retrieved from inversions. He i 10830 Å ﬁlaments are the dark
ribbons seen in the He ic line center image (dataset 3) above the regions separating the opposite polarity magnetic elements at the
photosphere. In the continuum images showing sunspots with visible umbra and penumbra, the region within an intensity contour
of 0.57 IQS (cyan contours in Figs. A.1–A.4), where IQS is the intensity of the surrounding quiet Sun, is considered as umbra. The
region enclosed between the intensity contours of 0.57 IQS and 0.85 IQS (yellow contours in Figs. A.1–A.4) is deﬁned as penumbra.
Note that we required an intensity threshold 0.8 IQS for datasets 1 and 10 and a threshold of 0.88 IQS for datasets 11 and 14 to deﬁne
the outer penumbral boundaries (probably due to the diﬀerent seeing conditions). These intensity fractions are visually derived to
best represent the respective boundaries. Note that these values are slightly diﬀerent from the isocontours of roughly 50 % and 90 %
of quiet Sun intensity normally used to determine the inner and outer penumbra boundaries in data from space based telescopes
(see, for example, Jurˇcák et al. 2018; Löptien et al. 2018), which is mainly due to the diﬀerent wavelength (6300 Å vs. 10825 Å).

(c) are saturated for better contrast. The arrows indicate the solar north and east directions. The yellow contours mark the boundaries of sunspots
and pores, and the cyan contours mark the umbra-penumbra boundary at the photosphere. The same contours are shown in black in the LOS
velocity maps of the slow component. The green and red shaded symbols overplotted on the intensity maps denote the locations of the supersonic

than 20 km s−
shown in Fig. 1.
