Prospects of experimental studies of argon and chlorine isotopes located far beyond the proton
dripline are studied by using systematics and cluster models. The deviations from the widespread
systematics observed in 28,29Cl and 29,30Ar have been theoretically substantiated, and analogous
deviations predicted for the lighter chlorine and argon isotopes. The limits of nuclear structure
existence are predicted for Ar and Cl isotopic chains, with 26Ar and 25Cl found to be the light-
est suﬃciently long-living nuclear systems. By simultaneous measurements of protons and γ-rays
following decays of such systems as well as their β-delayed emission, an interesting synergy eﬀect
may be achieved, which is demonstrated by the example of 30Cl and 31Ar ground state studies.
Such synergy eﬀect may be provided by the new EXPERT setup (EXotic Particle Emission and
Radioactivity by Tracking), being operated inside the fragment separator and spectrometer facility
at GSI, Darmstadt.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Several states in proton (p) unbound isotopes 28Cl,
30Cl and 29Ar were reported recently [1]. This work con-
tinues the research published in Refs. [1–4]. The system-
atics and cluster model studies in [1] allowed to interpret

∗ D.Kostyleva@gsi.de

the data as observations of ground state (g.s.) in 28Cl,
g.s. and three excited states in 30Cl, and one state in 29Ar
(either ground or excited state). Also the reported spec-
trum of 31Ar allowed for prescription of the g.s. energy of
this isotope by using the isobaric symmetry systematics.
Together with the known p-unbound isotopes 14,15,16F,
the studied argon and chlorine isotopes constitute the
most deeply-studied particle-unstable isotopic chains in
the whole Z ≤ 20 nuclei region.

In this work we continue the “excursion beyond the

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

proton dripline” of Ref. [1]. We intend to answer the
question: What impact the obtained experimental results
may have on our understanding of prospects to study the
other nuclides located far (e.g., 2–5 mass units) beyond
the driplines? Correspondingly, we discuss three main
topics:

(i) The previously-published systematics of one-proton
(1p) separation energies [1] are extrapolated further into
the unexplored region beyond the proton dripline. The
obtained results for the experimentally observed cases
(28−30Cl nuclides) are considerably diﬀerent from the sys-
tematic trends available in the literature [5–7]. We ex-
trapolate this systematics to the lightest chlorine and ar-
gon isotopes in Section III. The smaller than expected
values of decay energies suggest longer-living states, and,
consequently, weaker limitations on the nuclear structure
existence beyond the dripline.

(ii) We clarify the prospects of a limit of the nuclear
structure existence by using the obtained information on
the separation energies. We assume that a nuclear con-
ﬁguration has an individual structure with at least one
distinctive state, if the orbiting valence protons of the
system are reﬂected from the corresponding nuclear bar-
rier at least one time. Thus nuclear half-life may be used
as a gauge of such a limit. It is clear that the very long-
lived particle-emitting states are quasistationary. This
means that they can be considered as stationary for ma-
jority of practical applications. For example, the half-
lives of all known heavy two-proton (2p) radioactivity
cases (45Fe, 48Ni, and 54Zn) are of few seconds. Thus,
their 2p decays are so slow that weak transitions become
their competitors with branching ratii of dozens of per-
cent [8]. We may assume that modiﬁcation of nuclear
structure by continuum coupling is absolutely negligi-
ble for such states. In contrast, the continuum coupling
becomes increasingly important for broad ground states
beyond the driplines. For example, see the discussion
connected with studies of the 10He g.s. in Ref. [9]. This
work demonstrated that the observed continuum proper-
ties of 10He can be crucially modiﬁed by peculiarities of
initial nuclear structure of the reaction participants for
the widespread experimental approaches (e.g. knockout
reactions). Such a situation can be regarded as transi-
tional to continuum dynamics, where observable contin-
uum response is also deﬁned by the reaction mechanism
and initial nuclear structure. Here the properties, inter-
pretable as nuclear structure of the reaction products,
cannot be reliably extracted from measured data. For
example, we may refer to the well-known tetra-neutron
system in continuum [10], where such an ambiguity has
been demonstrated by applying the realistic scenario of
the tetra-neutron population. Within the topic of the
above discussion, we predict the limits of nuclear struc-
ture existence to be near the 25Cl and 26Ar isotopes in
Section IV.

the Super-FRS Experiment Collaboration of the FAIR
project, see Refs. [11, 12] and Fig. 1. The tracking sys-
tem for light ions and γ-ray detector were installed down-
stream of the secondary target in the internal focal plane
of the fragment separator FRS at GSI, Darmstadt (see
the details in Ref. [1]). The ﬁrst half of FRS was set for
production and separation of 31Ar ions, and the second
half was used as a spectrometer for heavy-ion decay prod-
ucts. The optical time projection chamber (OTPC) in-
stalled at S4 was studying beta-delayed particle emission
and radioactive decays of heavy fragments living long
enough to pass through the 30 m of the S2–S4 second
half of the FRS. In this paper we demonstrate that the
complementary measurements performed by all compo-
nents of the EXPERT setup can be combined together,
which allows for synergy eﬀect in studies of the above-
mentioned unbound nuclear systems. Such an eﬀect is
demonstrated in Section V by examples of 30Cl and 31Ar
studies.

II. THE THEORETICAL MODELS APPLIED

We apply several simple theoretical tools in this work.
The systematics of 1p separation energies Sp in chlo-
rine isotopes are studied by using the core+p potential
cluster model from [1]. The systematic of Coulomb dis-
placement energies in such a model is sensitive to two
basic parameters: (i) an orbital size (governed by a po-
tential radius) and (ii) charge radius of the core. These
parameters are varied in the model in a systematic way.

 
The systematics of 2p separation energies S2p in argon
isotopes are based on (i) the Sp values obtained from
systematics of the related chlorine isotopes, and (ii) sys-
tematics of odd-even staggering energies based on the
corresponding long isotopic and isotonic chains. This
approach was actively used in our previous works [1, 2],
and it has proven to be very reliable tool with easily-
estimated uncertainties.

The 1p-decay widths of chlorine isotopes are calculated
by using the above-mentioned potential cluster model.
We assume that the internal normalization of continuum
states is an indicator of their resonance behavior. Such
an indicator is more tractable for the broad states in
comparison with the corresponding behavior of the phase
shifts. We also use the R-matrix model for the 1p-decay
width estimates in case of very narrow states.

The three-body 2p-decay widths of argon isotopes are
estimated by using the R-matrix-type model from Ref.
[8]. This model can be traced back to the three-body ap-
proximation with a simpliﬁed three-body Hamiltonian,
which neglects nucleon-nucleon interaction [13, 14]. The
widths calculated by this model match the correspond-
ing calculations of the complete three-body model within
the factor of ten in the worst case. In the speciﬁc case
of 2p-decay width estimates of 26Ar, we use the sophis-
ticated three-body core+2p cluster model developed for
its mirror isobaric partner 26O in [15, 16].

The unit system ~ = c = 1 is used in this work.

III. CHLORINE AND ARGON ISOTOPIC
CHAINS FAR BEYOND THE PROTON
DRIPLINE

The isotopes between 32Cl and 28Cl have been stud-
ied in Ref. [1] by applying the two-body cluster AS+p
model. The major parameters of the model (potential
and charge radii of the sulphur core nucleus) were system-
atically varied (see Table I in [1]). The Thomas-Ehrman
eﬀect [17, 18], especially pronounced in the s-d shell nu-
clei is well accounted by such a model. As a result, the
consistent description of the known low-lying spectra of
32Cl and 31Cl was obtained as well as the reasonable ex-
planation of the newly observed states in 30Cl, 29Cl, and
28Cl nuclei.

Here we estimate the further isotopes beyond the pro-
ton dripline: 25−27Cl and 26−28Ar. The problem here is
that for the lighter chlorine isotopes, the respective “core
nuclei” 24−26S are particle-unbound with separation en-
ergies estimated in Table I. These estimates are partly
illustrated in Figure 2. So, the main decay channels are
expected to be 2p, 3p, and 4p emission from 26S, 25S,
and 24S, respectively. One may notice that the decay en-
ergies of various decay branches of sulphur isotopes are
much smaller than those of 1p emission from chlorine or
2p emission from argon isotopes. This means that the
decay mechanism of 25−27Cl should be sequential emis-
sion of one proton followed by emission of 2 − 4 protons

neutron separation energies S2n for oxygen isotopic chain from
[5] are shown by the thick gray line, two-proton separation

solid black line. Red dotted line corresponds to the calculated

from the respective sulphur daughter. Similarly, the de-
cay mechanism of 26−28Ar should be sequential emission
of two protons followed by the emission of 2 − 4 protons.
The half-life values of such sequential decays are practi-
cally entirely deﬁned by the ﬁrst “fast” step of sequential
proton emission with large Q2p value. Therefore we will
not take into account particle-instability of 24−26S in the
following half-life estimates.

The results of the cluster AS+p model calculations
from Ref. [1] for 26Cl and 27Cl are shown in Figure 3. For
calculation of 25Cl we used the 24O+n potential devel-
oped for studies of the 26O in Ref.[16]. The 25O spectrum
is quite “poor”: it contains just one known d-wave 3/2+
state [19–21]. By adding Coulomb interaction to the po-
tential we obtain the 25Cl g.s. at Er = −Sp = 6.0 − 6.3
MeV. The Er uncertainty here is deﬁned by the 24S
“charge radius” uncertainty taken in accordance with
Fig. 12 of [1].

The systematics of proton separation energies Sp for
the chlorine isotopic chain is given in Figure 5 (a). For
illustration purpose we use here the data compiled in
the NNDC database [5], the standard AME2012 evalu-
ation [6], and the recent isobaric multiplet mass evalu-
ation [7]. One may see that the predicted systematics

of [7] along the isobaric chain exactly follows the ex-
perimentally known systematics along the isotonic chain
and can be regarded as trivial, while the predictions of
[6] somewhat deviate from the isotone evolution. The
predictions of our cluster model here and in [1] (where
they are supported by the data, see Table II) demon-
strate considerable deviations from the isotone expecta-
tion. These deviations have one major source — the
Thomas-Ehrman shift (TES) eﬀect — which is a well-
established phenomenon and which is reliably described
by the cluster model used in [1] and here.

On the basis of the developed Sp systematics for the
chlorine isotopic chain, we can turn to the systematics
studies of the argon isotopic chain. Following the ap-
proach of Ref. [1] we apply the systematics of odd-even
staggering energies (OES)

2EOES = S2p − 2Sp ,

see Figure 4. For the chlorine isotopic chain beyond the
dripline there is the trend of overbinding because of TES.
For the argon isotopic chain there should be a compe-
tition of two trends:
(i) overbinding because of TES
(Coulomb displacement energy decreases because of an
increase of the valence orbital size) and (ii) underbinding
due to EOES reductions (pairing energy decreases because
of an increase of the valence orbital size). This eﬀect has
been already emphasized in Ref. [2]. Thus for the limit-
ing estimates of the S2p in the argon isotopic chain we
use the upper and lower estimates of Sp shown in Fig. 5
(a), which are then subtracted from the full 2EOES value
and multiplied by the factor of 1/2. The obtained results
are shown in Fig. 5 (b). The Sp and S2p predicted for Ar
and Cl isotopic chains are also collected in Table II.

it may aﬀect limits of existence of nuclear structure

For energies E varying from 0 to ∼ 90% of the barrier
height, the estimate is ν ≈ 1 − 3 MeV. Thus we can
assume that the systems with widths exceeding 3−5 MeV
have shorter half-lives than those needed for formation of
the nuclear state. Such a system decays instantaneously,
as, with a large probability, there will not be a single
reﬂection from the potential barrier.

The width values of the chlorine isotopes can be esti-
mated from the calculated excitation spectra which are
illustrated in Fig. 6. For this purpose, we have used
the internal normalization N (E) of two-body continuum
wave function ψ(kr)

One of the fundamental tasks of nuclear science studies
is determination of the limits of existence of individual
states in nuclear systems. The half-life value can be cho-
sen as a quantitative criterion of the nuclear structure
formation. Let us consider a system formed by a poten-
tial barrier and assume that in order to form a nuclear
state, there should be at least one reﬂection of the va-

as a measure of the resonance formation. This is done
in contrast to conventional scattering phase shifts which
could not provide a ﬁrm signature of a resonance forma-
tion in the case of very broad nuclear states (Γ & 1 MeV).

One may see in Fig. 6, that s-wave states in chlorine iso-
topes become quite broad already in 27Cl (Γ & 3 MeV).
However, the d-wave states remain reasonably narrow
(Γ ∼ 1.5 MeV) even in 25Cl with its quite high decay
energy Er ∼ 6 MeV.

In Fig. 7 we provide the upper-limit width estimates
for the Argon isotopes. They are performed in a “direct
decay” R-matrix model from Ref. [8], where each proton
is assumed to be in a resonant state of the core+p sub-
system with resonant energy Eji . The diﬀerential of the
decay width is given by

where ji is the angular momentum of a core+pi subsys-
tem. This model can be traced to the simpliﬁed Hamilto-
nian of the three-body system in which the nucleons in-
teract with the core, but not with each other. The model
approximates the true three-body decay mechanism and
also provides a smooth transition to the sequential de-
cay regime [13, 14]. The matrix element hV3i can be well
approximated by

hV3i2 = D3[(ET − Ej1 − Ej2 )2 + (Γph(ET ))2/4] ,

where the parameter D3 ≈ 1.0 − 1.5 (see Ref. [14] for
details), and Γph(ET ) should provide smooth width be-
havior around ET ∼ Ej1 + Ej2 . The assumed R-matrix
parameters for the widths

the chlorine isotopic chain. Such an assumption guar-
antees the upper-limit width estimate (see discussions in
[8, 13, 14]). However, this does not work for 26Ar. The
25Cl isotope which is core+p subsystem of 26Ar has very
“poor” spectrum with just one low-energy d-wave state.
For that reason we make a [d2]0 estimate for 26Ar decay.
In order to cross check it, we made three-body calcula-
tions of excitation function in a full three-body model. It
is known that for 2N decays of higher orbital conﬁgura-
tions accounting for N -N ﬁnal state interaction may lead
to a drastic decrease of the half-life [15]. The three-body
calculations are completely analogous to the calculations
of 26O g.s. in Ref. [16] with the added Coulomb interac-
tion in the p-p and core-p channels. The corresponding
excitation function is shown in Fig. 6. The obtained res-
onance energy ET ∼ 11.7 MeV is in a good agreement
with systematic results of this work, see Fig. 5 (b) and
Table II. The estimated width value Γ ∼ 3 MeV is shown
in Figure 7.

To conclude this Section, a number of relatively narrow
states, which presumably can be interpreted in terms of
nuclear structure, is predicted in the chlorine and argon
isotopic chains down to 26Ar and 25Cl isotopes. These
are located on N = 8 shell closure and the lighter systems
along these chains are not expected to exist. Population
of such exotic systems is far beyond the reach of any mod-
ern experiment. However, we emphasize that there exists
a rich, often not considered, research ﬁeld far beyond the

V. SYNERGY EFFECT IN THE EXPERT
SETUP

The experimental setup used in the works [1–4] is a
pilot version of the EXPERT (EXotic Particle Emission
and Radioactivity by Tracking) project proposed for the
physics program of the Super-FRS Experimental collab-
oration of the FAIR facility, see Refs. [11, 12]. The EX-
PERT setup will be located mainly in the middle of the
Super-FRS fragment separator which ﬁrst part will pro-
duce and separate ions of interest, and the second part
will measure momenta of heavy-ion decay products with
high precision. The EXPERT setup is being tested at
the FRS fragment separator at GSI (Darmstadt).
It
consists of the following devices, see Fig. 1: (i) charged-
particle tracking system based on microstrip silicon de-
tectors (µSSD) located downstream of the secondary tar-
get in the S2 middle focal plane of FRS, (ii) Optical time
projection chamber (OTPC) at the end of FRS, (iii) γ-
ray detectors around the secondary target GADAST. Im-
portant part of the EXPERT initiative is (iv) the use of
the second half of FRS as a high-resolution spectrometer.
This feature provides unique {A, Z} identiﬁcations for a
number of possible long-lived (i.e., with T1/2 & 100 ns)
heavy-ion reaction products and their implantation into
the OTPC for radioactivity studies.

The instruments (i)–(iii) can be operated as indepen-
dent devices and each of them has scientiﬁc value of their
own. However, for studies of nuclear systems beyond the
dripline, the elements of EXPERT operated together pro-
vide an important synergy eﬀect which has not been dis-

7

cussed so far. Let us demonstrate such a synergy eﬀect
by example of the 30Cl and 31Ar g.s. studies.

Figure 8 shows the constrains that can be imposed on
the ground state energies of 30Cl and 31Ar connected with
diﬀerent types of measurements and theoretical consider-
ations given below. They are partly based on the half-life
estimates of these isotopes presented in Fig. 9. First, let
us explain the Fig. 9. The half-life of 30Cl is calculated
for 29S+p s-wave decay by the R-matrix model,see Eq.
(2). The half-life of 31Ar ground and ﬁrst excited states
are estimated by the R-matrix-type direct decay three-
body model, see Eq. (1), Table III and the corresponding
discussion. The calculations are performed assuming the
[s2] and [sd] conﬁgurations in the 29S+p+p channel, re-
spectively. For the 31Ar ﬁrst excited state the 2p decay
energy ET ∼ 1 MeV is expected, while for the 30Cl g.s.
the expectation is Er ∼ 0.5 MeV [1]. Therefore for this
state the turnover from a true 2p to a sequential 2p decay
mechanism is expected at ET & Er. These decay modes
are characterized by very diﬀerent behavior of width as
a function of energy. We have estimated three half-life
curves for the 31Ar ﬁrst excited state corresponding to
the assumed 30Cl g.s. energies of 0.4, 0.55, 0.7 MeV,
which are shown in Fig. 9 by the red doted curves.

One should note that the widths of states are estimated
for the fastest possible s-wave proton emission from 30Cl
as well as the fastest [s2]-wave 2p decay from 31Ar g.s.
We have also assumed that the ﬁrst process in the decay
of the 31Ar excited state is the emission of the s-wave
proton, which is a very conservative estimate because
the 30Cl g.s. has presumably an s-wave conﬁguration.
So, the more realistic half-life limitations could be even
more stringent than those provided below.

Now we turn to a description of the obtained limits on
decay energies of 31Ar and 30Cl, which are illustrated in
Figure 8. There are in total 6 diﬀerent limitations con-
nected with observation or/and non-observation of dif-
ferent states and decay channels in these systems.
(i) The horizontal and vertical hatched bands correspond
to the energies directly inferred from the measurements
by the µSSD tracking system as discussed above in this
work and in Ref. [1].
(ii) The diagonal hatched band is provided on the basis
of systematics of OES energies of Fig. 13 (a) from [1].
We assume that isobaric symmetry for 31Ar is a good
assumption giving 2EOES = 0.915 MeV. In Fig. 8 we
assume that some deviation from this value (−300 keV)
is possible but not too much, and 2EOES = 0.615 MeV
is taken as the lower limit.
(iii) The ions of 30Cl were not observed at the ﬁnal focal
plane of FRS. This means that the half-life of 30Cl is
shorter than the time-of-ﬂight (ToF) through the S2–S4
section of FRS which is around 150 ns. We use the ToF
value of 50 ns as the upper-limit estimate. This imposes
the corresponding lower-limit estimate Er > 160 keV,
see the green arrow in Fig. 9 and the magenta horizontal
dotted line in Fig. 8.

order to study β-delayed proton emission [23]. A non-
observation limit value is less than the obtained branch-
ing ratio of 7(2)×10−4 for the β-delayed decay channel of
31Ar. This means that the 31Ar g.s. energy is ET < 0.4
MeV, see the blue arrow in Fig. 9 and the vertical violet
dotted line in Fig. 8. Otherwise, the prompt 2p emission
from 31Ar becomes faster than its β-decay.
(v) The estimated half-live curves for 2p decay of the 31Ar
ﬁrst excited state are given in Fig. 9. It is clear that if
the partial half-life of 31Ar with respect to 2p emission is
longer than ∼ 1 fs, then the preferable decay branch for
this state is γ-deexcitation to the ground state. Since the
2p decay of the 31Ar ﬁrst excited state is really observed,
then the half-life limitations indicated by the red arrows
in Fig. 9 infer synchronous limitations both on proton
decay energy Er of 30Cl g.s. and two-proton decay energy
ET of the 31Ar ﬁrst excited state. The latter is transfered
into ET of the 31Ar g.s. in Fig. 8 by subtracting 0.96

MeV as assumed from isobaric symmetry with 31Al in
Ref. [1] (inclined black dotted line). For example, let us
consider the Er = 0.7 MeV curve in Fig. 9. It provides
the ET = 1.21 MeV limit and thus leads to the black
dotted line passing through point {0.21, 0.7} in Fig. 8.
(vi) Analogous information could be inferred from non-
observation of γ-rays from the γ-decay of the 31Ar ﬁrst
excited state in GADAST (the inclined red line in Fig. 8).
The statistics in the current experiment was not suﬃcient
to make this information signiﬁcant, but in general case
it could provide additional cross-check of consistency for
the diﬀerent types of the data.

All in all, the limitations shown in Fig. 8 lead together
to a dramatic reduction of the area admissible for the cor-
related 30Cl vs. 31Ar g.s. energies compared to the data
provided by the µSSD tracking detectors of the EXPERT
only. We should state here that the conﬁdence in the re-
sults for 30Cl and 31Ar g.s. energies is strongly enforced
by the synergy analysis presented here.

VI. SUMMARY

In this work we use the data [1] concerning the most
remote from the proton dripline 30−28Cl and 31−29Ar iso-
topes, which allow for the further advances in studying
an unknown domain beyond the proton dripline. The
main results of this work are:
(i) The systematic studies of the chlorine and argon iso-
topic chains beyond proton dripline have been performed.
Large Thomas-Ehrmann shifts were revealed for the 29Cl
and 30Ar isotopes in Ref. [2], and here we report further
increased values in the 28Cl and 30Cl isotopes. The pre-
dictions for the very remote from the dripline isotopes
27Cl and 28Ar are provided by the elaborated models.
For these isotopes, the Thomas-Ehrmann eﬀect becomes
less important as (a) the isobaric mirror partners of these
nuclides are located in proximity of the neutron dripline
and (b) the ground states are d-wave states which are less
prone to modiﬁcation by the Thomas-Ehrmann shift.
(ii) The obtained decay energies for the experimentally
observed cases (28−30Cl nuclides, [1]) are considerably
diﬀerent (smaller) from the systematic trends available
in the literature. The extrapolations to even lighter chlo-
rine and argon isotopes also continue this trend. Smaller
decay energy systematics means “survival” of the nu-
clear structure for even more remote from the dripline
particle-unstable systems. The limits of nuclear structure
existence for the proton-rich edge of chlorine and argon
isotope chains are predicted to be in 26Ar and 25Cl.
(iii) Amazingly small 2p-separation energy of 6(34) keV
of the 31Ar ground state reported in the preceding arti-
cle [1] has been explored in addition by using the comple-
mentary data available in the setup and relevant theoreti-
cal speculations. The synergy eﬀect of the measurements
performed by diﬀerent detectors of the EXPERT setup
was demonstrated. It gives the stronger support to the
conclusions about the decays of 30Cl and 31Ar isotopes.
