Abstract 

We have synthesized  two  new Eu-based compounds, EuSr2Bi2S4F4  and  Eu2SrBi2S4F4 which 

are derivatives of Eu3Bi2S4F4, an intrinsic superconductor with Tc = 1.5 K. They belong to a 

tetragonal  structure  (SG:  I4/mmm,  Z  =  2),  similar  to  the  parent  compound  Eu3Bi2S4F4.  Our 

structural  and  151Eu  Mössbauer  spectroscopy  studies  show  that  in  EuSr2Bi2S4F4,  Eu-atoms 

exclusively occupy the crystallographic 2a-sites. In Eu2SrBi2S4F4, 2a-sites are fully occupied 

by Eu-atoms and the other half of Eu-atoms and Sr-atoms together fully occupy 4e-sites in a 

statistical  distribution. In both  compounds Eu atoms occupying the  crystallographic 2a-sites 

are  in  a  homogeneous  mixed  valent  state  ~  2.6  -  2.7.  From  our  magnetization  studies  in  an 

applied  H    9  Tesla,  we  infer  that  the  valence  of  Eu-atoms  in  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  at  the  2a-sites 

exhibits  a  shift  towards  2+.    Our  XPS  studies  corroborate  the  occurrence  of  valence 

fluctuations of  Eu and after Ar-ion sputtering show evidence of enhanced population of Eu2+-

states.  Resistivity  measurements,  down  to  2  K  suggest  a  semi-metallic  nature  for  both 

compounds.  

Introduction 

The  recently  known  BiS2-layer  containing  superconductors  have  gained  considerable 

attention. Broadly categorising, these superconducting materials comprise the families Bi-O-S 

(Tc = 4.5-6 K)1–5, LnO1−xFxBiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Yb) (Tc = 1.9-5.4 K)6–12, and 

Sr1−xLnxFBiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) (Tc ~ 3 K)13–17. The parent LnOBiS2 (Ln = La, Ce 

and  Th)  and  SrFBiS2  compounds  are  semiconducting18–20. 

In 

these  compounds, 

superconductivity  is  induced  by  doping  them  with  suitable  electron  donors6,13,16,17. 

Application of external hydrostatic pressure21–25 results in further enhancement of Tc. The two 

Eu-based BiS2 superconductors EuFBiS2 (Eu-1112) (Tc = 0.3 K)26 and Eu3Bi2S4F4 (Eu-3244) 

(Tc  =  1.5  K)27  are  different  from  other  BiS2-superconductors  in  that  they  are  intrinsic 

superconductors,  namely,  no  external  doping  is  required  to  induce  superconductivity. 

Superconductivity  in  Eu-1112  and  Eu-3244  takes  place  due  to  the  mixed  valence  state  of 

europium ions (Eu2+ Eu3+) which effectively creates electron-doping. Enhancement of Tc of 

Eu-1112 (Tc   = 8.6 K at 1.86 GPa) and Eu-3244 (Tc   = 10 K at 2 GPa) has been reported by 

chemical and external pressure effects28–31. 

The  selenium  substituted  derivative  Eu3Bi2S4-xSexF4  (0  ≤  x  ≤  2)  of  Eu3Bi2S4F4  have 

been known to show Tc higher than that of Eu3Bi2S4F4 and it also exhibits a negative chemical 

pressure effect. The layered Eu3Bi2S4F4 is made up of two EuFBiS2 layers linked by a EuF2 

layer  in  between.  Here  the  fluorite  type  Eu3F4  layers  and  the  rocksalt  type  BiS2  bilayers 

alternate along the crystallographic c-axis. 

We  have  successfully  synthesized  two  new  Eu-based  compounds,  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  and 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4,  derived  from  Eu3Bi2S4F4  and  studied  their  structural,  electrical  and  magnetic

properties. More specifically, we have investigated the phenomenon of valence fluctuations of 

europium,  using  151Eu-Mössbauer  and  XPS  techniques,  which  Eu-ions  occupying  specific 

crystallographic  2a-sites  in  these  materials  exhibit.  Here  we  present  the  results  of  our 

investigations. 

Experimental 

Polycrystalline  samples  of  nominal  compositions  Eu3-xSrxBi2S4F4  (x  =  1  and  2)  were 

synthesized by heating EuF3, EuF2, SrS, SrF2, Bi2S3 and Bi metal. Bi2S3 was pre-synthesized 

by  the  reaction  of  Bi  and  S  at  500  °C,  respectively  for  12  h  in  vacuum.  Stoichiometric 

amounts  of  the  reactants  were  mixed  well,  pelletized,  sealed  in  evacuated  quartz  tubes  and 

heated at 850°C for 35 h. The heat-treated pellets were dark black, non-lustrous, and remained 

stable  in  air  for  several  weeks.  They  were,  however,  preserved  in  an  Ar-filled  glove-box  to 

avoid  any  unnecessary  contamination.  The  phase  purity  of  the  samples  was  checked  by 

powder  X-ray  diffraction  using  Cu  Kα  radiation  using  a  Bruker  D8  advance  diffractometer. 

Rietveld  refinement  analysis  of the powder  X-ray  diffraction data was  carried out using the 

TOPAS  software  package32.  Resistivity  measurements  in  the  temperature range  of  2−300  K 

was  carried  out  using  a  conventional  four-probe  method  in  a Quantum  Design  Physical 

Property Measurement System (QD PPMS) Evercool-II. Magnetization measurements on the 

polycrystalline samples were carried out in the temperature range of 2-300 K using a PPMS 

(Quantum Design) with a VSM option. 

The 21.53 keV transition of 151Eu with an activity of 130 MBq (2 % of the total activity 

of  a  151Sm:EuF3  source)  was  used  for  the  Mössbauer  spectroscopic  characterization.  The 

measurements were conducted in transmission geometry with a commercial (78 K and 5 K) 

cryostat, while the source was kept at room temperature. The Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and EuSr2Bi2S4F4 

 
4 

samples  were  placed  in  thin-walled  PMMA  containers  at  an  optimized  thickness.  Fitting  of 

the spectra was performed with the Normos-90 program system33. 

X-ray  Photoemission  Spectroscopy  (XPS)  experiments  were  carried  out  using  an 

Omicron Multi-probe® Surface Science System; equipped with a monochromatic source (XM 

1000) and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (EA 125). Throughout the photoemission 

experiments were carried out at an average base pressure of ∼3.1 × 10−11 torr with a power of 

300 Watt. The total energy resolution, estimated from the width of the Fermi edge, was about 

0.25  eV  for  the  monochromatic  AlKα  line  with  photon  energy  of  1486.70  eV.  The  pass 

energy for the core level spectra was kept at 50 eV. Ar-ion sputtering performed at 2 KeV by 

maintaining an extractor pressure of 25 mPa. To get the estimation of change in the valence 

state of Eu, deconvolution was performed on all sputtered XPS spectra, using Peak FitTM (v4, 

Jandel  Scientific  Software)  on  Eu  (3d5/2).    Both  Eu  (3d5/2)  peaks  were  fitted  with  four 

Gaussian  components,  leading  to  the  area  under  the  curve.  The  precision  of  the  peak  fit 

analysis was better than 99% for both the compounds.  

Results and discussion 

X-ray and EDX studies 

The Rietveld fit to the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of polycrystalline Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  Both  samples  were  nearly  phase  pure  and  most  of  the 

peaks could be well indexed on the basis of the tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm) of 

Eu3Bi2S4F4. Minor (<5%) impurity peaks corresponding to EuF2.4 at 2θ = 26.9 degrees were 

present in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and EuSr2Bi2S4F4. The same impurity phase has also been reported in 

Eu3Bi2S4F4

27.  The  compositions  of  the  two  samples  were  examined  by  EDX  spectroscopy, 

thereby confirming the intended ratio of Eu:Sr as 2:1 in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and 1:2 in

2;  two  Eu-atoms  and  four  Sr-atoms  in  a  unit  cell),  both  the  Eu-atoms  in  the  unit  cell  are 

assigned  to  fully  occupy  the  2a-sites  and  the  four  Sr-atoms  are  assigned  to  fill  the  4e-sites 

completely.  With  this  distribution,  EuSr2Bi2S4F4  has  a  well  ordered  crystal  structure.  The 

structural  refinement  using  this  distribution  of  atoms  resulted  in  a  reasonably  good  RWp  = 

5.80% and a goodness-of-fit (²) = 2.40. In Eu2SrBi2S4F4, there are four Eu-atoms and two Sr-

atoms in a unit cell. Out of the four Eu-atoms in a unit cell in this case, we assign two Eu-

atoms to fully occupy 2a-sites. The 4e-sites in this case are assumed to be filled by two Eu-

atoms and two Sr-atoms, with Eu- and Sr-atoms statistically distributed over the 4e-site in this 

material.  With  this  distribution  of  atoms  in  the  case  of  Eu2SrBi2S4F4,  we  could  get  an 

acceptable RWp = 6.17% with a g.o.f. (²) of 3.63.

The  refined  lattice  parameters  (as  shown  in  Tables  1  and  2)  are:  For  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  a  = 

4.0661(2), c = 32.611(4) Å and V = 539.16(8)  Å3; and for EuSr2Bi2S4F4 a = 4.0628(1), c = 

32.805(1) Å and V = 541.47(3) Å3. For the sake of comparison, we also give here the lattice 

parameters  of  the  parent  compound  Eu3Bi2S4F4  a  =  4.0771(1),  c  =  32.4330(6)  Å  and  V  = 

539.1 Å3 27. Comparing the ionic radii of Sr2+ (1.26 Å) and Eu2+ (1.25 Å) / Eu3+ (1.07 Å) one 

would expect nearly the same lattice parameters for the three compounds34.

Figure 1 (c) shows the variation of the lattice parameters with the Sr content x.  It is evident 

that lattice parameter a  decreases slightly  with  increasing Sr concentration, while  the lattice 

parameter c and the cell volume V both increase with increasing Sr concentration. The Eu/Sr–

F  and  Sr–F  bond  lengths  in  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  and  EuSr2Bi2S4F4  are  2.70(4)  and  2.72(2)  Å, 

respectively. These bond lengths are quite similar to the Eu(1)–F bond length in Eu3Bi2S4F4 

(2.678(5)  Å).  The  other  Eu(2)–F  bonds  in  Eu2SrBi2S4F4,  EuSr2Bi2S4F4  and  Eu3Bi2S4F4  are 

2.42(4), 2.37(2), and 2.403(6) Å, respectively. These bond lengths are smaller than the Eu(1)-

F  bond  distances  which  clearly  indicates  a  significant  deviation  of  Eu  from  a  divalent 

character.  Thus  from  the  structural  analysis  we  assume  that  the  Eu-atoms  at  the  2a-sites  in 

both  compounds  are  in  a  mixed  valence  state,  closer  to  3+  state.  Earlier  Zhai  et  al.  have 

shown27 that Eu-atoms occupying the 2a-sites in Eu3Bi2S4F4 are in mixed valence state. More 

precise  information  about  the  Eu-valence  is  obtained  through  our  151Eu  Mössbauer 

spectroscopy (vide infra) and XPS studies.  

Mössbauer spectroscopic studies 

151Eu  Mössbauer  spectra  of  the  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  and  EuSr2Bi2S4F4  samples  are  presented  in 

Figures 2 and 3 along with transmission integral fits. The corresponding fitting parameters are 

listed in Table 3. Both samples show two well resolved signals that can be attributed to Eu2+ 

(signals  with  an  isomer  shift  around    =  –12.7  to  –12.9  mm  s–1)  and  Eu3+  (signals  with  an 

isomer shift  around    =  0.1 to  0.2 mm s–1). These  values of the isomer shifts  compare well 

with  those  of  ionically  bonded  di-  and  tri-valent  europium.  The  Eu2+  signals  show  some 

degree  of  quadrupole  splitting  (EQ),  a  consequence  of  the  non-cubic  site  symmetry.  The 

experimental line width values () are slightly higher than usually observed (around 2.3 mm 

s–1).

(a) EuSr2Bi2S4F4 

In Eu3Bi2S4F4, the bond valence sum (BVS) calculations27 suggest a divalent state of the Eu-

atoms occupying the 4e-sites and a strongly mixed valence state (~60% trivalent component) 

of  Eu-atoms  occupying  the  2a-sites.  Considering  that  the  Eu-bond  lengths  in  EuSr2Bi2S4F4 

and Eu2SrBi2S4F4 are close to those in Eu3Bi2S4F4, similar valence states of Eu-atoms at the 

2a- and 4e-sites in our compounds may be expected.

spectra of EuSr2Bi2S4F4 at 5K, 78 K and ambient temperature (r.t.). 

At room temperature, the intensity of the signal corresponding to Eu2+ is about 30% of that of 

Eu3+ as shown in figure 2. This is close to the theoretical Eu2+:Eu3+ ratio on the basis of the 

BVS calculations (as pointed out above) considering that the Eu-atoms occupy only the 2a-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

sites. This also means that we see similar Eu-mixed valence in EuSr2Bi2S4F4 as was observed 

in EuFBiS2

26. We also note that at 78 and 5 K the relative intensities of the Eu2+: Eu3+ lines 

remain nearly same as those of the two lines at room temperature (see Table 3).

(b) Eu2SrBi2S4F4 

The Mössbauer spectrum of Eu2SrBi2S4F4 in figure 3 presents yet another interesting feature 

of the distribution of Eu-atoms in these compounds. This spectrum exhibits two Eu-lines with 

isomer shifts well known for Eu2+ and Eu3+ states (as shown in Table 3). The areas under the 

peaks corresponding to the Eu2+and Eu3+ Mössbauer lines at room temperature are in the ratio 

of 48/52 ~ close to 1 which is consistent with all the Eu-atoms at the 4e-sites as in a stable 

valence  state  of  Eu2+  and  the  Eu-atoms  at  the  2a-sites  are  in  nearly  Eu3+-state    just  as  in 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4. At 78 and 5 K, the intensity of the Eu2+-line is found to increase slightly (see 

figure 3 and Table 3). Since the Eu-atoms at the 4e-sites are in a Eu2+-state already, this weak 

enhancement of intensity of Eu2+-line  shows that Eu-atoms at the 2a sites acquire a small 2+-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 

character  at  78  and  at  5  K.  This  establishes  weakly  temperature  dependent  mixed  valence 

character of Eu-atoms at the 2a-sites. 

Figure  3.  Experimental  (data  points)  and  simulated  (continuous  lines)  151Eu  Mössbauer 
spectra of Eu2SrBi2S4F4at 5 K, 78K and ambient temperature (r.t.). 

To  summarize 

this  discussion  of 

the  Mössbauer  spectroscopic  measurements:  In 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4,  all  the  Eu-atoms  are  located  at  the  same  crystallographic  2a-sites.  Thus 

observing two signals in the Mössbauer spectra corresponding to Eu2+ and Eu3+ states clearly 

suggest that they are in a homogeneous mixed valence state. In Eu2SrBi2S4F4, the situation is 

somewhat different. Eu-atoms in this case are located at both 2a and 4e sites. The Eu-atoms at 

the  4e-sites  are  in  stable  valence  state  (2+)  and  the  Eu-atoms  at  the  2a-sites  are  in  a  mixed 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 

valence  state  but  close  to  3+  at  room  temperature.  At  78  and  5  K,  there  is  a  perceptible 

enhancement of the intensity of the Eu2+-signal, implying that the Eu-valence shifts towards 2. 

The decrease of the valency of Eu (approach towards Eu2+) with decreasing the temperature, 

as observed in the present work,  is in contrast with the situation in well known intermetallic 

Eu-mixed valence materials, as for example EuCu2Si2

35 and EuPd2Si2

36, wherein the valence 

of  Eu  increases  strongly  towards  3  with  the  decrease  of  temperature.  In  this  sense,  the 

temperature variation of the average valence observed in this work is rather unusual.  

We  must  point  out  here that  in  homogeneous  intermetallic  mixed  valence  materials  such  as 

EuPd2Si2,  the  two  participating  valence  states  Eu2+  and  Eu3+  in  the  valence  fluctuations 

phenomenon  are  not  observed  separately  in  151Eu-Mössbauer  spectroscopy.  This  is  because 

the Eu-Mössbauer characteristic time  MOSS is much larger than the valence fluctuation time 

VF  in  intermetallics  and  therefore  Eu-Mössbauer  spectroscopy  sees  an  average  line.  As  in 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4, Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and in EuFBiS2, two distinct Eu2+ and Eu3+ lines are observed, it 

means  that  in  these  materials,  VF    >>  MOSS.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  besides  our  two 

materials  EuSr2Bi2S4F4  and  Eu2SrBi2S4F4,  only  two  other  such  materials  EuFBiS2  and 

Eu3Bi2S4F4 are known with VF  >> MOSS. 

X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) studies 

Systematic X-ray photoemission spectroscopy experiments have been carried out for Eu3-

xSrxBi2S4F4  with  x  =  1  and  2.  The  experimental  conditions  were  kept  identical  for  the 

experiments. During the photoemission studies, small specimen charging was observed which 

was later calibrated by assigning the C 1s signal at 284.6 eV. To get a clean surface, Ar ion 

sputtering  was  performed  on  the  samples.  Figure  4  shows  the  x-ray  photoelectron  3d  core-

level spectra of Eu in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and EuSr2Bi2S4F4. The main features of the spectra are the 

 
13 

3d spin-orbit split states 3d2+

3/2, 3d2+

5/2, 3d3+

3/2 and 3d3+

5/2 at binding energy 1155, 1125, 1165 

and  1135  eV  respectively.  We  also  see  a  relatively  much  weaker  satellite  peak  (marked  as 

“sat”) at ~ 8 eV higher binding energy (B.E.) relative to the B.E. of the peak 3d3+

5/2. This sat 

peak  originates  from  the  multi-electronic  excitations  during  the  photoelectron  emission 

process as has been observed in a number of Eu-compounds ,e.g. EuF3, EuCl3 and Eu2O3

37, 38. 

As we are not concerned with such effects in this work, we shall not talk about this satellite 

peak any more.   

Qualitatively  speaking,  intensities  of  the  four  spin-orbit  split  states  contain  information 

about the mixed valence state of the Eu-ions in these compounds and also about the surface 

states.  The  area  under  the  curve  referred  as  %  change  in  the  valence  state  of  Eu  (3d5/2)  is 

obtained (from peak deconvolution, not shown here) and listed in Table 4. We first look at the 

XPS spectrum  of  EuSr2Bi2S4F4. As described  above, Eu-atoms  in  this  material  occupy only 

the 2a-sites. Thus, just as in the Mössbauer spectroscopic studies, our observation of the two 

sets of peaks, Eu2+ peaks (3d2+

3/2 and 3d2+

5/2) and Eu3+ peaks (3d3+

3/2 and 3d3+

5/2 ) demonstrates 

clearly and independently occurrence of the mixed valence phenomenon associated with Eu-

ions in this material. What is new in the XPS spectra, however, is the evidence of the presence 

of the enhanced Eu2+-states in the surface layer of the sample. Consider, for example, the ratio 

of the intensities of the two XPS lines  3d2+

5/2 and 3d3+

5/2. A simple estimate shows that this 

ratio is ~ 43/57 (Figure 4, Table 4), much bigger than 0.29/0.71, the ratio of the populations of 

the two valence states Eu2+ and Eu3+, as inferred from the Mössbauer spectroscopic data, in 

the  mixed  valence  state  of  Eu-atoms  in  the  bulk  of  the  material.  At  this  point,  it  must  be 

stressed that XPS is a surface sensitive technique and explores only about 100 Ǻ thick surface 

layer. Thus the extra population of Eu2+-states as detected by XPS must be due to the surface 

layer having a larger population of Eu2+-states. Such a transition from Eu3+-states in the bulk 

 
14 

to Eu2+-state in the surface layer has been reported for several Eu-compounds such as EuF3, 

EuCl3 and Eu2O3

37.

In the case of Eu2SrBi2S4F4 also we observe two sets of peaks, Eu2+ states (3d2+

and  Eu3+  states  (3d3+

occupying  the  2a-sites  is  very  nearly  3+  as  we  discussed  above  while  considering  the 

Mössbauer spectra of the compound. An equal number of Eu-atoms, occupying the 4e-sites, 

are in a Eu2+-state. Thus we should see nearly the same intensity of these two sets of Eu-XPS 

peaks.  The  intensity  ratio  of  the  two  XPS  peaks  of  3d2+

5/2  and  3d3+

5/2  (~  55/45)  (Figure  4, 

Table 4) clearly shows that the Eu2+ states have higher population than that of Eu3+states. This 

higher  intensity  ratio  Eu2+/  Eu3+  of  the  XPS-peaks  in  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  also  clearly  shows  the 

contribution of the Eu2+ states originating from the surface layer. 

Magnetization studies 

A most remarkable effect that we observe in these materials is a strong variation of  the Eu-

valence by the application of a magnetic field as we discuss below. We must stress here that 

we  have  carried  out  the  magnetization  measurements  on  two  independent  samples  and 

obtained very similar results. We show in Figure 5 results of our magnetization measurements 

at 5 K in EuSr2Bi2S4F4 as well as in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 as a function of applied magnetic field. The 

saturation magnetic moment at 5 K in EuSr2Bi2S4F4 in an applied field of 9 T is 1.75 µB / f.u. 

From  this  value  of  Eu-moment  (there  are  no  other  magnetic  species  in  the  material),  we 

estimate the fraction of Eu2+-state as 1.75/7 = 25% which corresponds to an average valence 

of Eu as  2.75. This  estimate of  the fractional  populations of the two valence states of  Eu is 

consistent  with  the  intensities  of  the  two  lines  in  the  151Eu-Mössbauer  spectrum  of 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4, shown in figure 2. 

 
 
 
16 

Figure 5. Magnetization isotherms of Eu2SrBi2S4F4 (black) and EuSr2Bi2S4F4 (red) at 5 K 

There  are  already  examples  of  Eu-  and  Yb-valence  changes  in  applied  magnetic  fields 

reported in literature39–41. We find evidence of a similar valence change in an applied field in 

the case of Eu2SrBi2S4F4. The measured saturation magnetic moment is 9.39 µB / f.u. A large 

fraction  (7  µB)  of  this  saturation  moment  arises  from  the  divalent  Eu-atoms  at  the  4e-sites.  

The remaining contribution of 2.39 µB must come from the mixed valent Eu-atoms at the 2a-

sites, which means that in the applied field the mixed valence of Eu-atoms at the 2a-sites is  

2.39/7 ~ 2.65. The Mössbauer spectrum of Eu2SrBi2S4F4, figure 3, shows both the Eu2+- and 

Eu3+-lines with nearly equal integrated intensities. This implies that Eu-atoms occupying 2a-

sites in this material which are nearly 3+ in zero applied field move towards 2+ state in the 

presence  of  a  magnetic  field.  Mitsuda  et  al.  observed  similar  effects,  namely  field  induced 

valence  change,  in  applied  fields  of  ~  100  T  in  Eu(Pd1-xPtx)2Si2

39.  To  put  it  concisely,  in 

Eu2SrBi2S4F4  we  observe  the  remarkable  phenomenon  of  a  field-induced  change  of  the  Eu-

valence, moving from Eu3+ to Eu2+ in the applied magnetic field. Non-availability of  a high 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 

field  option  in  our  Mössbauer  spectrometer  does  not  permit  us  to  observe  this  remarkable 

phenomenon  directly,  namely,  a  growth  of  the  intensity  of  the  Eu2+-line  as  a  function  of 

applied magnetic field.  

Resistivity studies 

Results  of  resistivity  ρ  (T)  measurements  at  ambient  pressure  of  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  and 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4  are  shown  in  Figure  6.  Both  samples  show  a  semi-metallic  behavior  in  the 

temperature range of 2 – 300 K. At room temperature, the resistivity of both samples is quite 

low;  ~  1-1.5  mΩcm  for  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  and  EuSr2Bi2S4F4.  In  the  former  compound,  ρ  (T) 

remains more or less temperature independent down to 2 K whereas in the latter, it rises to ~ 3 

mΩcm at low temperature. The temperature dependence and these values of the resistivity are 

comparable  to  those  of  Eu3Bi2S4F4  which  is  known  to  exhibit  superconductivity  below  Tc  ~ 

1.5 K27. We do not observe superconductivity in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 and EuSr2Bi2S4F4 down to 2 

K. However, the possibility of superconductivity below 2 K in these materials cannot be ruled 

out.

Conclusion 

We  have  successfully  synthesized 

the  polycrystalline  compounds  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  and 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4,  which  are  new  derivatives  of  the  Eu-3244  and  crystallize  in  a  tetragonal 

structure (I4/mmm). In EuSr2Bi2S4F4, Eu-atoms occupy the 2a-sites and Sr-atoms occupy the 

4e-sites.    In  Eu2SrBi2S4F4,  2a-  sites  are  fully  occupied  by  Eu-atoms  and  the  4e-sites  are 

occupied  by  Eu-atoms  and  Sr-atoms  in  equal  proportion  and  are  randomly  distributed.  Eu-

atoms  at  the  2a-sites  in  both  EuSr2Bi2S4F4  and  Eu2SrBi2S4F4  are  in  a  homogeneous  mixed 

valence  state  with  fluctuations  of  the  Eu-valence  slow  with  respect  to  the  Mössbauer 

spectroscopy time scale. XPS studies also reveal the occurrence of Eu-valence fluctuation. In 

EuSr2Bi2S4F4 we find the average Eu valence to be ~ 2.7 from Mössbauer spectroscopy and 

magnetization experiments as well.  An important observation of our magnetization results of 

Eu2SrBi2S4F4 is that the valence state of Eu at 2a-sites moves from nearly 3+ (in zero applied 

field)  to  the  estimated  valence  of  2.65  in  the  presence  of  applied  magnetic  field.  This  is  a 

significant field induced valence change in fields of the order of 10 T.
