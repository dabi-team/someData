ABSTRACT
Water ice covers the surface of various objects in the outer solar system. Within the
heliopause, surface ice is constantly bombarded and sputtered by energetic particles
from the solar wind and magnetospheres. We report a laboratory investigation of the
sputtering yield of water ice when irradiated at 10 K by 4 keV singly (13C+, N+, O+,
Ar+) and doubly charged ions (13C2+, N2+, O2+). The experimental values for the
sputtering yields are in good agreement with the prediction of a theoretical model.
There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the yield for singly and doubly charged ions. Using
these yields, we estimate the rate of water ice erosion in the outer solar system objects
due to solar wind sputtering. Temperature programmed desorption of the ice after
irradiation with 13C+ and 13C2+ demonstrated the formation of 13CO and 13CO2,
with 13CO being the dominant formed species.

1 INTRODUCTION

Water ice is a major component of solid bodies in the outer solar system and played a major role in the planet formation
process (Lunine 2006). Beyond ∼ 4 AU it is not warm enough for water ice to undergo substantial sublimation, resulting in
potential lifetimes of order of the age of the solar system and its observed presence on the surfaces of moons and Kuiper Belt
objects e.g. Guilbert et al. (2009), Dalton et al. (2010), Brown et al. (2012). Water ice, however, will still undergo erosion due
to dust and macroscopic body impact and irradiation by cosmic rays, ions in the solar wind and, for moons and ring particles,
magnetospheric ions. Chemical species can be lost from or redistributed on surfaces as a result of this bombardment and
new chemical species can be formed (Hudson & Moore 2001; Johnson 1990). Some of the newly formed species will remain
embedded in the ice, changing its chemical composition, whilst others may in turn be ejected from the surface. This process
has been observed in laboratory ion irradiation experiments involving ices e.g. Brunetto et al. (2006). In some cases sputtering
leads to the formation of thin atmospheres made of water molecules, its dissociation products plus the sputtering species;
these have been observed around Jovian and Saturnian Satellites e.g. (Hall et al. 1995; Brown & Hill 1996; Johnson et al.
2008). Additionally, energetic ion sputtering is at least partly responsible for global compositional changes across Tethys and
Mimas (Schenk et al. 2011).

Sputtering of H2O ice has been intensively studied in laboratory experiments with both low energy ions (below 10
keV) and high energy ions (from 10 keV to a few MeV). Almost four decades ago, Brown et al. (1978) reported pioneering
experiments in the sputtering of water ice by H+, He+, C+ and O+ ions with MeV energies; they reported that the sputtering
yield of molecules ejected from water ice per incident MeV ion was higher than predicted by contemporary theory. Brown
et al. continued this sputtering work and found that at high energies electronic processes are dominant (Brown et al. 1980).
An electronic process represents the interaction of the projectile ions with the electrons of the target and will mostly produce
ionization and excitation Sigmund (1981). Cooper & Tombrello (1984) used 1.6–2.5 MeV 19F ions to sputter water ice and
concluded that sputtering yields are sensitive to the charge state of the ion, but independent of ice thickness and temperature

below 60 K. Subsequent investigators conﬁrmed no dependence on ice thickness or temperature at T < 60 K (Baragiola et al.
2003; Bar-Nun et al. 1985), with the latter study ﬁnding no variation up to T = 140 K. Furthermore, Johnson et al. (1983)
found that water ice has a yield of 10 molecules per ion at 10 K when bombarded with 1.5 MeV He+, which was in good
agreement with the results obtained by Brown et al. (1978). Other experimental studies of high energy ion sputtering on water
ice have reported dependencies on temperature and angle of incidence (Teolis et al. 2005; Vidal et al. 2005; Teolis et al. 2009).
The formation of CO2 from 30 keV energy ion bombardment of H2O ice was studied by Strazzulla et al. (2003b) and Lv et al.
(2012)

The energies and masses that make up the ion sputtering population depends strongly on environment, whether the
icy surface is within a planetary magnetosphere, within the distant solar wind or exposed solely to the galactic cosmic ray
population when outside the solar heliopause (Florinski et al. 2013). The ion population abundances and energies can be very
diﬀerent between these regions, and hence it is important to measure the sputtering yield (equivalent to the erosion rate) as
a function of ion species and energy. This in turn allows modelling of the erosion rate and the amount of liberated material.
Bar-Nun et al. (1985) used 0.5-6 keV H+ and Ne+ ions to irradiate water ice and observed the sputtered species H2, O2 and
H2O.Baragiola et al. (2003) critically analysed data from Bar-Nun et al. (1985) to determine normal incidence sputtering
yields due to, for example, 2-6 keV Ne+ ion impact. Christiansen et al. (1986) measured the sputtering yields from diﬀerent
ices at 78 K when bombarded with 4 keV Ar+, Ne+, N+ and He+. Finally, sputtering of water ice at 80 K by 2 keV He+ and
Ar+ ions at normal incidence was investigated by Fam´a et al. (2008), who also considered all the available data from previous
experimental studies to propose a formula to predict the sputtering yield from water ice at any temperature by ions of any
mass with energies of up to 100 keV.

At heliocentric distances of Rh (cid:39) 20 − 50 AU, the solar wind plasma has cooled to ∼ 1 eV so that the ion energy is
dominated by the bulk outward ﬂow (Bagenal et al. 1997). With a solar wind velocity of ∼ 450 km s−1, the kinetic energy
of the ions is therefore (cid:39) mion keV, implying that low-energy ion bombardment similar to the above experiments will be
important in the Centaur region and the Kuiper Belt. Therefore to accurately model the interaction between solar wind and
distant atmosphereless surfaces, it is important to test the validity of the Fam´a et al. (2008) formula for the erosion rate of
water ice. In this paper we present the results of experiments on the sputtering of water ice by 4 keV singly charged ions (C+,
N+, O+ and Ar+) and 4 keV doubly charged ions (C2+, N2+ and O2+), and compare them to theoretical predictions and
previous experimental data. Additionally, we report Temperature Programmed Desorption measurements of H2O ice following
sputtering by C+ and C2+. For all carbon ion experiments we used the isotope 13C, but for clarity we do not designate this
isotope when discussing C-ion processes.

2 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The experimental equipment used in the present work was described in detail in Muntean et al. (2015) and will only be brieﬂy
presented here. The full apparatus is comprised of two main parts; a low energy ion accelerator and an ultrahigh vacuum
interaction chamber. The ion source is separated from the target chamber by over 4 m of vacuum tubes with 4 stages of
diﬀerential pumping. Furthermore, the pressure of source gas in the ion source is typically 10−5 mbar. For all these reasons
the level of contamination from the ion source to the target chamber is negligible. Singly and doubly charged ions with energies
up to 10 keV are focused and collimated before directed onto the interaction chamber which had a base pressure of 1 × 10−9
mbar. The intensity of the ion beam is measured with a translatable Faraday Cup, which could be positioned in front of the
sample. During irradiation, a 90% transmission metal mesh is used to monitor the ion beam current.

Water ice ﬁlms were deposited onto a KBr substrate at T = 10 K and surrounded by a gold plated radiation shield at
T = 48 K. Water ice ﬁlms with thicknesses of up to 258 nm were deposited at a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 mbar from a nozzle
via a needle valve connected to a glass bottle containing Milli-Q water. The water was purged of dissolved gases in several
cycles of freezing and heating. The ﬁlm thickness was monitored with the laser interferometric method described in Muntean
et al. (2015); brieﬂy, a photodiode detector monitored the intensity of λ = 405 nm laser light reﬂected from the ice ﬁlm and
KBr substrate. The angle of incidence of the light on the substrate was 45◦.

Figure 1 shows the laser interferometer photodiode detector voltage as a function of time (ﬁlled circles) during the water
ice deposition process. The solid line is a model ﬁt to the experimental data based on laws of reﬂection and refraction (see
Muntean et al. (2015) for details). This enabled the refractive ice of the water ice to be determined and hence the ice density
to be calculated. We obtained a best ﬁt value of n = 1.28 ± 0.05. Using the Lorentz-Lorenz equation from Fulvio et al. (2009)
we calculated an ice density of ρ = 0.79 ± 0.02 g cm−3. These results are in good agreement with values of n = 1.29 ± 0.01
and ρ = 0.82 g cm−3 measured by Westley et al. (1998) by reﬂection of λ = 435.8 nm light from a water ice ﬁlm deposited at
T = 20 K. We also note that Wood & Roux (1982) measured the refractive index of water ice deposited at 20 K, 50 K and
80 K for 632.8 nm light and found a constant value of 1.32 for all three temperatures.

3 RESULTS

The water ice was irradiated at T = 10 K and 45◦ incidence with singly charged C+, N+, O+ and Ar+ ions and doubly
charged C2+, N2+ and O2+ ions. Figure 2 shows the photodiode detector voltage as a function of ion dose for irradiation of
an initially 258 nm thick water ice ﬁlm, at 10 K by 4 keV O+ ions. The solid line shown in Figure 2 is a model ﬁt using the
refractive index and density determined above. The ﬁtted curve starts to increase before the second minimum is reached. This
might be due to the irradiated ice ﬁlms beginning to scatter the laser light and resulting in a loss of coherence. However, this
does not aﬀect our results as we have a good measurement of the ﬁrst maximum, which is what is required for an accurate
measurement of the ice thickness. The upper horizontal scale in in Figure 2 indicates the thickness of ice removed determined
by the model, which was used to calculate the sputtering yield of n(H2O)/ion, viz. the number of water molecules removed
per incident ion.

Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the number of water molecules removed as a function of ﬂuence for 4 keV singly charged
C+, N+ and O+ and for 4 keV doubly charged C2+, N2+ and O2+ ions respectively. The ion beam intensity varied both for
individual ions and range of ions studied, thus we express it in ﬂuence rather then ﬂux. Typically ion ﬂuxes averages were
about 1.8 × 1012 ions/cm2/s for doubly charged ions and 9 × 1012 ions/cm2/s for singly charged ions. From the slopes of linear
regressions ﬁtted to the experimental data and the measured ice density and refractive index, the sputtering yields for each
ion species were calculated and are shown in Table 1. Taking our uncertainty in the ﬁtted refractive index and propagating it
through this analysis gives a total error budget of up to 20%. We note that the ﬁtting error in Figures 3 and 4 is ∼ 0.1%.

respectively, which were calculated using the standard Stopping Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM1) software. f denotes the
power of the angular scattering function, α is a function of the mass ratio between the target and the projectile atomic masses
and η is a function of the atomic number of the projectile. The empirical formulae used for obtaining the energy independent
values of η, α and f are explained in detail in Fam´a et al. (2008). U0 = 0.45 eV is the binding energy, and C0=1.81 ˚A2 is a
constant which is related to the diﬀerential cross section for elastic scattering in the binary collision approximation (Sigmund
1981).

Table 1 summarizes the experimental and the predicted values for the sputtering yield of water ice when bombarded with
singly and doubly charged ions. It can be clearly seen that the sputtering yield for both singly and doubly charged ions are the
same within the experimental error. In Figure 5 we plot our experimental values for the sputtering yield together with previous
measurements in the literature. Our experimentally determined values for the sputtering yields are consistent with previous
reports. For example, Fam´a et al. (2008) measured a sputtering yield for Ar+ at normal incidence of 12 molecules/incident ion.
This equates to 21.8 molecules/ion at 45 degrees incidence, consistent with our measured value of 19.8 ± 4.0 molecules/ion.
Recently, Galli et al. (2015) have measured the sputtering yield of porous NaCl water ice at 90 K for a range of ions with
energies between 1 and 30 keV ; the values obtained are consistent with all the data shown in Figure 5. The data of Galli et
al. are not plotted however, as the uncertainties of their measurements extend beyond the range of the ordinate. In Figure 5
we also show the predicted values from the Fam´a et al. (2008) theoretical model and ﬁnd good agreement. We note that there
is a slight tendency for the model to underestimate the experimental yields, the reason for this is unclear.

In addition, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out after the irradiation by 13C+
and 13C2+ with a constant ramp rate of 1 K/ min. As can be seen from Figure 6 and Table 2, irradiation by C+ produced
more CO2 than irradiation by C2+, with a yield ratio of 2.1 ± 0.2. This situation was reversed in the case of CO as shown in
ﬁgure 7, where the ratio of yields from C+ and C2+ was 0.4 ± 0.02. For C+ irradiation, the production ratio of CO/CO2 (cid:39) 27.
For C2+ irradiation, the production ratio of CO/CO2 (cid:39) 130

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Outer solar system sputtering rates

Our measured sputter yield can be used to estimate at what rate H2O ice is removed from the surface of an outer solar system
object due to irradiation by ions in the solar wind (SW). Taking a SW ion density of ni = 4.5 cm−3 and velocity vi = 400
km s−1 at 1 AU (Johnson et al. 1983) we calculate a total ion ﬂux at a nominal distance of a = 42 AU of vi ni/a2 = 105 ions
cm−2 s−1. Table 3 lists the relative abundances used here, calculated using the Genesis measurement of He/H ﬂuence in the
SW (Reisenfeld et al. 2007) and the values for C/He, N/He, and O/He from the Ulysses mission (von Steiger et al. 2000). We
combine these measurements to give the predicted the ﬂuxes at 42 AU for ions of H, He, C, N and O. Our O+ irradiation
experiment indicates that sputtering erodes 86 nm of H2O ice for a ﬂuence of 4.5 × 1015 O+ ions (Figure 2). As seen in Figure
5, this sputter yield scales as 0.59 mi where mi is the mass of the ion in amu. Using these ﬁgures we calculate in Table 3 the
expected erosion rate for H2O at 42 AU due to sputtering by SW ions.

We ﬁnd that proton erosion dominates, agreeing with expectations. It is also clear that sputtering will signiﬁcantly erode
and alter the optically active surface layers of ice in the Trans-Neptunian region on extremely short timescales relative to
dynamical lifetimes of observed objects of ≥ 4.5 × 109 years (Duncan et al. 1995; Morbidelli et al. 2008). Other laboratory
experiments have investigated the reddening of ices due to ion irradiation. According to the measurements of Strazzulla et al.
(2003a) and Brunetto & Roush (2008), it optimistically takes ∼ 109 years to produce a 1 micron-deep reddened irradiation
mantle. Sputtering by solar wind ions to a comparable depth is three orders of magnitude faster. This leads us to two
possibilities: Either sputtering does not remove the red irradiation mantle hypothesised to exist on outer solar system icy
bodies; or the material is naturally red and reddening by ion irradiation is not a dominant eﬀect.

We point out, however, that UV irradiation is an alternative pathway to the production of complex molecules (Bernstein
et al. 1997), a process that may occur on signiﬁcantly faster timescales than the ion-induced changes. Also, an initial com-
position of complex hydrocarbons can give rise to signiﬁcant reddening on dramatically shorter timescales (Kaˇnuchov´a et al.
2012). As such, we suggest an appropriate amount of caution when interpreting reddening timescales implied by laboratory
measurements.

Sputtering of surface ices may be even more important for water-ice rich Centaur objects evolving inwards from the
trans-Neptunian region into the giant planet region. Many Centaurs have spectroscopically conﬁrmed H2O ice absorption
bands on their surfaces (Barkume et al. 2008; Barucci et al. 2011). Lifetimes of Centaurs typically lie in the range 10–90 Myr
(Tiscareno & Malhotra 2003; Volk & Malhotra 2013). At ∼ 10 AU the erosion rate will be (42/10)2 ∼ 20 times faster, so the
solar wind will erode (cid:39) 0.1 − 1 mm of H2O ice on the surface of a Centaur during its dynamical lifetime. CO and CO2 ices
could also be present and will sublimate at these distances, although the observed activity in a small number of Centaurs
may be due to this or due to crystallization of amorphous H2O ice (Jewitt 2009; Guilbert-Lepoutre 2012). Our results show
that even without sublimation or crystallization, pure H2O ice will not survive unchanged. Therefore we conclude that the
optically active surfaces of all ice-rich bodies beyond Jupiter will be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed.

4.2 Formation of CO and CO2 by carbon ions

Our TPD results can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of CO and CO2 forming in the H2O ice as a result of irradiation
by C+ and C2+. It is interesting to compare these results with TPD measurements of Collings et al. (2004) who investigated
separate water ices with CO and with CO2 on the surface and with CO and with CO2 in the bulk. Surface samples were
prepared by deposition on top of water ice and samples with bulk CO and CO2 were prepared by co-deposition of either
CO or CO2 with H2O. In our experiments the majority of CO2 desorption occurs at T ∼ 145 K, 92% ± 10% in the case of
C+ irradiation and 71% ± 5% in the case of C2+ irradiation. This 145 K release was observed by Collings et al. (2004), who
attribute this in their experiments to the volcano desorption of trapped CO2 co-deposited with H2O.

The release of CO2 at around T ∼ 160 K for both singly and doubly charged ion irradiation corresponds to co-desorption
of trapped molecules with H2O. However signiﬁcantly less CO2 was released at this temperature, 2 ± 0.3%% for singly charged
ions and 11% ± 2% for doubly charged ions. This diﬀers from the results presented by Collings et al. (2004), who found roughly
equal amounts desorbed at T ∼ 145 K and T ∼ 160 K when the CO2 was co-deposited with H2O.

For CO, our TPD results show major broad peaks at lower temperatures. In C+ irradiation 93%±4% of the CO desorbs at
T = 42 K, whereas in C2+ irradiation 92% ± 2% desorbs at T = 50 K. The peaks at T = 145 K and T = 160 K that correspond
to volcano desorption and co-desorption respectively are minor features. Similar desorption features were observed by Collings
et al. (2004) for CO both deposited onto a pre-adsorbed H2O ﬁlm, and co-deposited with H2O. They also observed broad
desorption peaks at low temperatures, but with similar amounts of CO released at the higher temperatures. The dominance of
the low temperature peaks in the CO production, particularly in the case of C2+, suggests that charge dependent dissociation
processes are occurring at or close to the surface of the water ice. In the case of CO2, the majority is trapped below the surface
layers within the H2O matrix. It is interesting to note that diﬀerent chemical reactions due to irradiation have been observed
in layered H2O/CO/H2O ﬁlms in which CO layers were buried under amorphous solid water ﬁlms of diﬀerent thicknesses
and then irradiated with 100 eV electrons Petrik et al. (2014). They found that the products formed from the oxidation and
reduction/hydrogenation of CO were diﬀerent for buried depths of up to 50 monolayers compared to products of CO at depths
of more than 50 monolayers. Our work suggests a depth dependent eﬀect in CO and CO2 production.

Our yields in Table 2. imply that the mechanism for the formation of CO2 is more eﬃciently driven by C+ irradiation by
approximately a factor of 2 compared to C2+ irradiation. A similar result was found by Dawes et al. (2007), who irradiated
water ice at 30 K and 90 K with 4 keV C+ and C2+ and measured CO2 formation as a function of ion dose. They concluded
that that the CO2 yield for singly charged ions is greater than for doubly charged ions, in qualitative agreement with our
ﬁndings.

A signiﬁcant ﬁnding from our TPD measurements was the observed large production rate of CO relative to CO2. 4keV C
ions have a maximum penetration depth in water ice of 500 ˚Awith a peak range of 236 ˚A. If in our case we take the peak range
and the thickness removed (1700 ˚A), this means only 14% of the C2+ ions that can remain implanted to form CO and CO2.
Therefore, for a total ﬂuence for C2+ of 2.9×1016 ions/cm2, the maximum amount of retained ions becomes 2.1×1015ions/cm2.
For a production yield of ∼ 0.5, a beam area of 1.77×10−1cm2 and a measured abundance of CO/CO2=130 we have calculated
an upper limit of the CO2 produced to be 1.4 × 1012 molecules. In their previous study of 4 keV C-ion bombardment of H2O
ice, Dawes et al. (2007) did not observe any CO. However, we note that their lowest experimental temperature was 30 K.
This is where the sublimation of CO starts according to both our TPD measurements (Figure 7) and those of Collings et al.
(2004). Therefore we propose that as the CO formed preferentially at the surface, it was immediately sublimated during the
Dawes et al. (2007) study, thereby accounting for the lack of subsequent spectral FTIR signatures.

Finally, it is interesting to note that in a 30 keV study at 10 K by Lv et al. (2012) and Strazzulla et al. (2003b) CO
was not observed. This intriguing result may imply that CO formation by carbon ion bombardment of low temperature ice is
highly energy dependent, and deserves further study.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have measured the sputtering yield from irradiated ice at 10 K by 4 keV singly charged (C+, N+, O+ and Ar+) and
doubly charged ions (C2+, N2+ and O2+). In the case of singly charged ions, the sputtering yields have been compared with
a theoretical model from Fam´a et al. (2008) and overall our measurements are in line with previous results and the model‘s
predictions. Within experimental uncertainties, the sputtering yield of water ice does not depend on whether the projectiles
are singly or doubly charged ions. We conﬁrm that Solar wind sputtering of fresh ice surfaces in the Kuiper belt and Centaur
region can erode H2O on dynamically relevent timescales.

Temperature programmed desorption showed that CO formation dominates over CO2 formation. However 13C2+ is
relatively more eﬃcient in forming 13CO while 13C+ is relatively more eﬃcient in forming 13CO2. The majority of the 13CO
desorbs at T (cid:39) 42 K which suggests that this species is produced close to the surface of the water ice, whereas the majority
of the 13CO2 desorbs at T (cid:39) 145 K and indicates that CO2 is formed below the surface.
