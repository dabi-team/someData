ABSTRACT

Aims. Although the temporal evolution of active regions (ARs) is relatively well understood, the processes involved continue to be the
subject of investigation. We study how the magnetic ﬁeld of a series of ARs evolves with time to better characterise how ARs emerge
and disperse.
Methods. We examine the temporal variation in the magnetic ﬁeld distribution of 37 emerging ARs. A kernel density estimation
plot of the ﬁeld distribution was created on a log-log scale for each AR at each time step. We found that the central portion of the
distribution is typically linear and its slope was used to characterise the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Results. The slopes were seen to evolve with time, becoming less steep as the fragmented emerging ﬂux coalesces. The slopes reached
a maximum value of ∼ −1.5 just before the time of maximum ﬂux before becoming steeper during the decay phase towards the quiet
Sun value of ∼ −3. This behaviour diﬀers signiﬁcantly from a classical diﬀusion model, which produces a slope of −1. These results
suggest that simple classical diﬀusion is not responsible for the observed changes in ﬁeld distribution, but that other processes play a
signiﬁcant role in ﬂux dispersion.
Conclusions. We propose that the steep negative slope seen during the late decay phase is due to magnetic ﬂux reprocessing by
(super)granular convective cells.

1. Introduction

The evolution of active regions (ARs) in time is a well stud-
ied topic in solar physics (see van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015), yet the processes are still not fully understood. ARs result
from the emergence of buoyant magnetic ﬂux through the photo-
sphere. This magnetic ﬂux originates at the tachocline and rises
through the convection zone in the form of a magnetic ﬂux tube.
During the rise, plasma drains into the ﬂux tube legs, with con-
servation of angular momentum causing more plasma to drain
into the following leg. This distorts the shape of the ﬂux tube
and causes an increase (decrease) in magnetic pressure of the
leading (following) leg, as a result of the total pressure balance.
When the ﬂux tube reaches the base of the photosphere, its
environment changes dramatically; in particular it is no longer
buoyant. Magnetic ﬁeld accumulates here until the undulatory
instability or convective upward motions allow fragments of the
ﬁeld to rise and break through the photosphere in a series of
small magnetic loops (e.g., Pariat et al. 2004, and references
therein). The opposite polarities of these loops diverge and the
like polarities of many of these small loops coalesce to form
strong concentrated spots. The higher magnetic pressure of the
leading ﬂux tube leg means that the leading polarity forms a
stronger, more compact spot(s) than the following polarity. This
process of fragmented emergence followed by coalescence has
been well observed (e.g., Zwaan 1978; Strous et al. 1996) and
also modelled (e.g., Cheung et al. 2010).

During the emergence phase, the two polarity centres di-
verge, with their separation reaching a plateau around the time

the AR achieves its peak ﬂux. This indicates that the ﬂux tube
is no longer emerging. In addition, convective motions of super-
granular cells advect the region’s ﬁeld, breaking it apart. Other
processes may also play a role in the dispersion of the AR.
Moving magnetic features are magnetic ﬂux fragments that are
observed to move radially outward from sunspots advected by
the moat ﬂow (Harvey & Harvey 1973). They may also con-
tribute to the removal of ﬂux from the spot, although there is not
yet conclusive evidence for this (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015). Cancellation of AR ﬂux with the background ﬁeld also
contributes to the removal of magnetic ﬂux from the photo-
sphere, as well as cancellation between the two opposite polar-
ities along the internal polarity inversion line of the AR. The
decay phase of ARs is much longer than the emergence phase
and can last for several weeks (e.g., Hathaway & Choudhary
2008) or even months (e.g., van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 1999), with
the weaker following spot decaying much faster than the leading
spot.

In this study, we analyse the distribution (probability density)
of the vertical component of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld (or
ﬂux density), and below we refer to it simply as the ﬁeld dis-
tribution. This is a new method of characterising the evolution
of ARs, by looking at changes in the ﬁeld distribution as the re-
gions evolve. Our analysis is diﬀerent from the previous studies
which analyse the magnetic ﬂux distributions of photospheric
magnetic clusters (e.g., Parnell et al. 2009; Goˇsi´c et al. 2014),
as we do not cluster the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in mag-
netic entities. Section 2 describes the theoretical background of

emergence, clustering (merging) and diﬀusion with a focus on
the magnetic ﬁeld distribution expected with these physical pro-
cesses. The data used for the observational study are described in
Section 3, along with the AR area selection code, which deﬁnes
the pixels used to calculate the ﬁeld distribution. The ﬁeld distri-
bution plots and their characterisation are explained in Section 4.
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 show the statistical results of the charac-
terisation of 37 ARs. The characterisation reﬂects the diﬀer-
ent evolutionary stages; fragmented emergence, coalescence to
form strong sunspots and gradual dispersion of the AR. Then, in
Sections 5.3 and 5.4 we explore the dispersing phase of ARs as
well as the quiet Sun. We next investigate possible issues present
for the derived ﬁeld distributions in Section 5.5. Finally, the ob-
servational and theoretical results are discussed and compared,
allowing conclusions to be drawn in Section 6.

2. Theory

2.1. Emergence and Clustering

Numerical simulations of ﬂux emergence are typically set up
with an axial ﬁeld distributed with a Gaussian proﬁle (Fan 2001;
Toriumi & Yokoyama 2011). A global Gaussian proﬁle of the
two polarities would be expected at the photosphere if the mag-
netic structure did not change signiﬁcantly upon emergence.
However, as the ﬂux tube reaches the photospheric region it
splits into tiny ﬂux tubes, which emerge individually and re-
connect with one another (Strous et al. 1996; Pariat et al. 2004;
Cheung & Isobe 2014). Then, even if the axial ﬁeld did have
a Gaussian-like distribution in the convective zone, it is not
known how this distribution would be transformed at the pho-
tospheric level. The physical process of the emergence phase is
too complex to derive an expected magnetic ﬁeld distribution
P(Bz) where Bz is the vertical magnetic ﬁeld component.

During the later stages of emergence, small magnetic
concentrations of like sign merge to form strong polarities
(sunspots). A simple description of such a ﬂux concentration
with axial symmetry is the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle:

Bz(x, y) = Bmax((r/a)2 + 1)−n/2 ,

(1)

with r2 = x2 + y2, where x, y are the two orthogonal horizontal
spatial coordinates and a deﬁnes a characteristic radius of the
polarity. Bz is maximum at r = 0 and decreases as r−n for r (cid:29) a.
The case n = 3 corresponds to a magnetic source located
at z = −a below the photosphere; it models the linear spread-
ing with height, above z = −a, of a thin ﬂux tube located below
z = −a (see appendix of Demoulin et al. 1994). Such ﬁeld distri-
butions were used to model the magnetic ﬁeld of ARs by using
a series of ﬂux concentrations with the parameters (position and
intensity) ﬁtted to the observed magnetograms. This allowed the
computation of their coronal magnetic topology. In particular,
the derived intersections with the chromosphere of the computed
separatrices were found close to the observed ﬂare ribbon loca-
tions showing that magnetic reconnection is responsible for the
energy release (e.g., Gorbachev & Somov 1988; Mandrini et al.
1995; Longcope 2005).

Next, we compute the probability P(Bz) dBz of having a
magnetic ﬁeld value of Bz ± dBz/2 within the magnetic polarity.
This probability corresponds to the area 2π r dr with r related to
Bz by Eq. (1). Diﬀerentiation of Eq. (1) provides,

(2)

By substituting Eq. (2) into P(Bz) |dBz| ∝ 2π r |dr| one gets
P(Bz) ∝ |Bz|−1−2/n .
The proportionality constant is found by setting the total proba-
bility to unity. This integral is calculated in the r-range [0, rmax]
corresponding to the Bz-range [Bz,max, Bz,min]. This gives,
P(Bz) = 2

This result extends approximately to a series of ﬂux concentra-
tions modelling an AR as long as the source ﬁelds do not over-
lap signiﬁcantly. For n = 3, representing a magnetic source,
P(Bz) ∝ |Bz|−1.67, producing a slope of −1.67 when plotting
P(Bz) against Bz on a log-log plot. At the limit of very large
n values P(Bz) ∝ |Bz|−1, as for the diﬀusion case of one polarity
(cf. Section 2.2 and Eq. (8)). Although there is no clear physical
interpretation of this, it is unsurprising that diﬀering Bz distri-
butions, which depend on two spatial dimensions x and y, can
produce the same P(Bz), which varies as a function of only one
variable, namely Bz.

2.2. Diffusion of a magnetic polarity

Already during the emergence, and even more so during the de-
cay phase, the AR magnetic ﬁeld is aﬀected by convective cells
at various spatial scales (i.e. by granules and supergranules). The
AR magnetic ﬁeld is progressively dispersed in an ever increas-
ing area nearly proportional to the time duration since the emer-
gence started (e.g., van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2003). This is the
behaviour expected with classical linear diﬀusion. However, the
dispersion of an AR also involves local mechanisms not included
in classical diﬀusion, such as clustering of the ﬁeld at the border
of convective cells, cancellation of opposite-sign polarities and
submergence of small scale loops. Classical diﬀusion can pro-
vide an explanation for the area evolution, but can it also explain
the observed magnetic ﬁeld distribution?

As in Section 2.1, we compute the probability P(Bz) dBz of
having a magnetic ﬁeld value of Bz ± dBz/2 within the magnetic
polarity, which again corresponds to an area 2π r dr. In this case,
r is related to Bz with Eq. (6). Diﬀerentiation provides,

Plotting P(Bz) against Bz in a log-log plot, produces a slope of

S. Dacie et al.: Evolution of the Magnetic Field Distribution of Active Regions

The probability distribution of Bz is computed numerically
since the Bz isocontours are not simply circles (P(Bz) is com-
puted by summation along these isocontours). In a log-log plot,
the slope is in the range [−1, −0.94] at all times during the dif-
fusive evolution (Figure 2). More precisely, the slope ≈ −1 for
R/a > 3 and converges rapidly to −1 when the separation be-
tween the polarities is larger, as expected from Eq. (8). The slope
is maximum, ≈ −0.94, for 1 ≤ R/a ≤ 1.7, while it shows a slight
decrease to ≈ −0.96 for lower R/a values. When the polarities
are interacting the slope is slightly less steep than with one polar-
ity (slope = −1) because the other source acts to decrease Bz and
even removes weak values surrounding the inversion line. This
implies fewer cases with a given Bz value, particularly for low
Bz, making the global slope of the distribution slightly less steep.
Finally, the increase of probability values with time, as seen in
Figure 2, is simply due to the normalisation of the total prob-
ability to 1 while the maximum of Bz is decreasing with time
and the minimum of Bz is selected to be ﬁxed (here to Bz = 1),
modelling an instrumental detectability threshold.

The net ﬂux evolution is computed by performing the inte-

gration on the positive polarity, where x > 0, which gives,

small diﬀusion times,

while for large diﬀusion times Eq. (10) can be approximated as
F(t) ≈ F(0) R/
πk t so that the ﬂux of the polarities decreases
as t−1/2. The cancellation of ﬂux is due to the superposition of
the opposite polarities in the x direction. This is a 1D process, so
it scales as the ratio of the sizes in the x direction: R/

Equation (9) describes the diﬀusion of each polarity isotrop-
ically, i.e., they do not cancel but just superpose spatially. This
implies an apparent loss of magnetic ﬂux by superposition of op-
posite Bz values when computing the total ﬂux, however there is
not a physical cancellation since the full amount of both polari-
ties continue to diﬀuse with time. The other extreme behaviour,
a complete cancellation at the inversion line, can be described
by the ﬁeld:

where the function ext(a, b) is deﬁned as a if |a| > |b|, b if |a| <
|b|, and 0 otherwise (then it is a signed extremum function except
at |a| = |b| where it vanishes to model immediate cancellation).
This scenario is shown in the top right panel of Figure 1, with
the bottom right panel showing the Bz values at y = 0.

Equation (11) describes two magnetic polarities which are
diﬀusing independently of each other (no overlap of Bz as in
Eq. (9)) and they exactly cancel at x = 0 (no diﬀusion in the re-
gion of the other polarity). In the photosphere the opposite polar-
ities diﬀuse into each other as a result of advection by convective
cells of small ﬂux tubes, which at some point meet and cancel.
This process is mostly driven by the supergranular ﬂows and the
typical distance of travel across the inversion line in the other
polarity (the mean free path) is expected to be of the order of a
supergranular cell (about 30 Mm). Equations (9) and (11) are the
limits when the mean free path is inﬁnite and zero, respectively.
The probability of Bz, for values where the corresponding
isocontour is not touching the inversion line (x = 0), given by
Eq. (11), has the same Bz dependence as Eq. (8). For the lower Bz
values, some of the pixels are not present (those which would be
located on the other side of the y axis if they had not undergone

as described in Section 2.3 are shown here. The left hand side of
the plot shows superposition with no cancellation and the right
hand side shows the case where complete cancellation occurs at
x = 0. Two isocontours are also shown for both the negative
and positive spots. The two plots in the bottom row show a cross
section of the magnetic ﬁeld values taken at y = 0.

Bz for a bipolar ﬁeld diﬀusing with time. The Bz spatial distri-
bution is described by Eq. (9). The time t is normalised by the
initial time when R/a = 1 is selected (blue line). Only Bz > 1 is
supposed to be detectable. The black straight line has a slope −1
for reference.

2.3. Diffusion of a magnetic bipole

In this subsection we consider the evolution of a simple bipole
to model the global evolution of an AR. We suppose that the
centre of the two polarities are located at the ﬁxed positions
x = ±R, y = 0. Since Eq. (5) is linear in Bz, the evolution of
the bipole is the superposition of two solutions of Eq. (6) when
shifted spatially by ±R:

where F is the total ﬂux of the isolated positive polarity. This is
illustrated in the top left panel of Figure 1, with the bottom left

The spatial distribution of Bz in Eq. (9) depends on the pa-
rameters F, a =
4 k t and R. F deﬁnes the ﬁeld strength while
a deﬁnes the polarity size and both are scaling factors. The main
parameter of Eq. (9) is R/a. For R/a (cid:29) 1 the polarities are well
separated and do not overlap, while for R/a (cid:28) 1 the opposite
polarities mostly cancel each other leaving a dipolar magnetic
ﬁeld.

The magnetic ﬁeld data were ﬁrst treated using a cosine cor-
rection assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld is locally vertical. This
was followed by a derotation to central meridian to correct for
area foreshortening.

3.2. Deﬁnition of AR area

A rectangular submap surrounding the maximum extent of the
AR was manually deﬁned, with the area of the AR itself deﬁned
using a semi-automated technique (adapted from that outlined
in Yardley et al. 2016). This process was important to ensure an
unbiased estimation of the ﬁeld distribution of the AR, especially
as the rectangular submap contains magnetic ﬁeld from the quiet
Sun as well as possibly ﬂux from neighbouring regions which
would aﬀect the results.

To focus on the larger scale features rather than individual
ﬂux fragments, the absolute values of the magnetic ﬁeld within
the submap were smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter with a stan-
dard deviation (width) of 7 pixels. The AR extension is then
automatically deﬁned from the areas in which the pixels have
smoothed values > 40 G (shown in Figure 3a). For the initial
stages of ﬂux emergence, our code searches for a bipolar region,
deﬁned as having between a ﬁfth and ﬁve times the amount of
positive ﬂux as negative ﬂux. If no bipole is found a search is
made for positive and negative bubbles that are close to each
other (within a distance of 20 pixels, approximately 10 arcsec-
onds). To include regions of fragmented ﬂux emergence, more
of the original bubbles are accepted if they lie within 20 pixels
of this selection or 10 pixels of these additional bubbles.

As ARs evolve, they change signiﬁcantly, with the sea ser-
pent structures coalescing into two main polarities which grow to
cover a larger area of the solar surface. To reﬂect these changes,
the AR area selection criteria change after the unsigned ﬂux of
the near bipole region has reached 8×1020 Mx, when the AR area
was found to dominate the rectangular submap. The AR area is
still chosen from the regions of pixels with smoothed values >
40 G, but the selection criteria are diﬀerent, with larger regions
and regions close to the large regions being chosen. To capture
fragments of ﬂux that break away from the main polarities, this
area is then extended to neighbouring regions (within 10 pixels).
If at any time step the automated selection is not satisfactory,
for example if there are inconsistencies between neighbouring
time steps (i.e. ﬂux at the edge of the region is not included in
the selection at one time step, but is included in both the pre-
ceding and the following time steps), the selection can be made
manually from the smoothed submap.

Once the region has been selected, dilations are applied to in-
clude the region immediately surrounding the selection, as this
was found to have a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld distribution to that
of the quiet Sun (see Section 5.5) and is therefore assumed to
be strongly inﬂuenced by the emerging ﬂux. For the ﬁrst dila-
tion, the signed data were smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter of
width 7 pixels. The pixels of smoothed values > 20 G or < -20
G are selected (shown in Figure 3b with blue contours). Each
of these regions is compared to the previously selected region
(yellow contour), and if there is some overlap, the pixels in that
region are unmasked (panel c of Figure 3). Because the blur-
ring is applied to the signed values, the dispersing parts of the
region are likely to be accepted, while any diﬀuse neighbour-
ing regions of opposite polarity should be avoided. Finally two
ﬁeld-independent dilations are applied, both using a disk-shaped
kernel with a radius of 12 pixels (providing a smoother edge than
a single dilation with a larger kernel). All the pixels in the dilated
region (shown Figure 3d) are taken for the analysis.

Fig. 3. Example of the area selection and dilation procedure
(Section 3.2) for NOAA AR 11945. Panel a shows the selec-
tion > 40 G in the blurred map of absolute ﬁeld values. Panel b
shows the selection > 20 G and < -20 G in the smoothed signed
map (blue), along with the selection from panel a (yellow). Panel
c shows the selection after the ﬁeld dependent dilation and panel
d the ﬁnal region selection after the ﬁeld independent dilation.

cancellation) so the probability is slightly lower. In summary, the
distribution P(Bz) shown in a log-log plot (as in Figure 2) has a
slope of exactly −1 for large |Bz| values and slightly above −1
(less steep) for low |Bz| values.

All in all, this implies that P(Bz) is similar for an ineﬃcient
cancellation rate (Eq. (9)) and for a very eﬃcient one (Eq. (11)).
Thus, any cancellation rate, with a classical diﬀusion of the po-
larities is expected to imply a slope (cid:38) −1 for P(Bz) drawn in a
log-log plot.

3. Data and AR Selection

3.1. Data and data treatment

We studied the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of 37 ARs that emerged
on the solar disk between June 2010 and the end of 2014. To en-
sure consistency and that the emergence time could be correctly
identiﬁed, only those ARs that emerged in relatively magnetic-
ﬁeld free regions (without detectable remnant of other ARs)
were chosen. In addition, only ARs emerging prior to central
meridian passage (CMP) were selected to analyse all, or at least
most, of the emerging phase. The resulting ARs are given in
Table A.1.

The ARs were studied using photospheric line-of-sight mag-
netograms from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou
et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO;
Pesnell et al. 2012). The time at which each AR started to
emerge was found by visual inspection of the line-of-sight mag-
netograms. Although this method is subjective and is inﬂuenced
by the position of the AR on the solar disk (issues which are dis-
cussed in Fu & Welsch 2016), these eﬀects were negligible as a
result of the relatively low time cadence data (6 hours) used here
to study the ARs.

For the decaying ARs discussed in Section 5.3, the ARs be-
gan to emerge on the far side of the Sun. In order to estimate
the emergence start times in these cases, we used data from the
Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescope onboard the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory Behind (STEREO B; Kaiser
et al. 2008) spacecraft.

nel width such that the kernel width is inversely proportional
to the frequency at that point. Thus a kernel width proportional
to |Bz| was used. There are a few reasons why a lower limit on
the kernel width was chosen for low |Bz| values. One reason is
to represent the instrumental errors, which reduce the precision
of the measurement. Another reason is that the frequency does
not increase indeﬁnitely as the value |Bz| decreases. Instead, it
is expected that the distribution and its derivative are continuous
across 0 Gauss on a linear Bz scale. Indeed the KDE plots do
show that the distributions are ﬂatter for |Bz| values less than ∼
25 G (e.g., Figure 4).

4.2. Observed Distributions

All the KDEs were found to have some common features,
namely a ﬂatter section below ∼ 10 G followed by a turning
point (the ﬁrst knee, at ﬁeld value k1, indicated by a vertical line
on Figure 4), a steeper section up to ∼ 1000 G and then another
turning point (the second knee, at ﬁeld value k2, also indicated
by a vertical line) after which the frequency drops oﬀ rapidly.
Although k2 varies greatly with the age and strength of the AR,
it was not used to characterise the distribution as it is highly de-
pendent on only a very small proportion of pixels.

To capture only the larger scale features, an extra smoothed
KDE plot was created using Gaussian kernels of twice the width
as before, and the positions of the knees (k1 and k2) were found
from this. k1 was taken as the point of most negative second
derivative before the slope goes to values less than −1. k2 was
taken as the ﬁrst time, moving along the KDE graph from right
to left, that the slope becomes more positive (less steep) than −3.
A best ﬁt line was ﬁtted to the original (not extra smooth) KDE
plot between 1.5× k1 and 2
3 × k2. The best ﬁt line was calcu-
lated using the method of least squares, taking data points evenly
spaced along the log(B) axis. Examples are shown (dashed lines)
in Figure 4 for both the positive and negative distributions.

5. Observational Results

5.1. Temporal Evolution

Figure 5 shows how the slope of the distributions changes with
time from the start of AR emergence for all studied ARs (listed
in Table A.1). The slopes start oﬀ steep and negative, in about
the range [−2.2, −1.5], peak in the range [−1.7, −1.2], and then
become steeper (more negative) again as the ARs decay.

The initially steep slope is related to the fragmented emer-
gence. It is followed by the coalescence of ﬂux elements to form
stronger ﬂux concentrations and indeed the slopes around t = 60
hours are comparable to the slopes found for a magnetic source
with n = 3 (≈ −1.67) as derived in Section 2.1, Eq. (4). The
change in slope during the regions’ decay is due to dispersion
with the number of higher-ﬁeld pixels decreasing and the propor-
tion of low to middle ﬁeld pixels increasing. The latter evolution
goes away from the slope given by classical diﬀusion (≈ −1,

5.2. Evolution versus Magnetic Flux

The timescale of emergence varies broadly from one AR to an-
other (e.g., van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015, and references
therein). As a result, in Figure 5 ARs with various ﬂux values
and emergence durations are presented together, mixing diﬀer-
ent phases and ﬁeld strength distributions of AR evolution (e.g.,
∼ 80 hours after the start of ﬂux emergence some ARs are still

tions of the knees, k1 and k2 (vertical lines), and the lines of best
ﬁt to the middle section (dashed) are shown for both polarities.

4. Kernel Density Estimation Analysis

4.1. Method

Kernel density estimation plots
(KDEs; Wegman 1972;
Silverman 1986, and references therein) were created for each
time step, showing the distribution of pixels with respect to ﬁeld
value (ﬂux density) on a log-log scale. KDEs are very similar
to histograms, in that both types of plots show the distribution
of data points. However, histograms rely on discretising the data
points, using user-deﬁned bins, which normally leads to a loss of
information. Moreover, the arbitrary choice of bin positions can
aﬀect the subsequent interpretation. On the other hand, KDEs
assign a kernel of a certain width to each data point, eﬀectively
smoothing the ﬁnite number of data points. This KDE technique
has been shown to be superior to histograms both theoretically
and in applications (e.g., de Jager et al. 1986; Vio et al. 1994),
and KDEs have been used in a broad range of astrophysics do-
mains (e.g., Schulze-Hartung et al. 2012; Sui et al. 2014).

The applied kernels of KDE plots can take on any shape and
were chosen to peak at the data point value and to decay away
from this. The kernel widths can also be varied depending on the
data point value. A larger width can be used where there is less
data, enabling the noise in the distribution to be made roughly
constant. While the smoothness of a KDE clearly depends on the
kernel widths, similar to the dependence of histograms on their
bin widths, unlike histograms there is no dependence on an ar-
bitrary choice of bin position (the kernel is applied and centered
on each data point).

The KDEs in this study1 were created using a Gaussian ker-
nel with standard deviation equal to 2.5 G for ﬁeld values be-
tween -25 and +25 G and equal to |Bz|/10 for |Bz| > 25 G. This
was chosen to give a plot with the noise level being roughly in-
dependent of Bz (as it would appear on a log-log plot). From
the theoretical considerations of Section 2, a line with a slope
of −1 would be expected for the KDE when plotted on a log-log
scale. This means that the pixel frequency would be proportional
to 1/|Bz|. The optimal KDE should be built with a variable ker-

emerging while smaller ARs are already in their decay phase).
In this Section, we characterise the emergence stage of an AR
by the amount of emerged magnetic ﬂux, normalised to its max-
imum value.

The maximum ﬂux, Fmax, is deﬁned as the maximum un-
signed ﬂux achieved during the AR evolution, so long as this
value was not reached at the last time step. 24 regions from the
original 37 reached peak ﬂux and were included in this part of
the study. The other regions were still in their emergence phase
at the end of the observational time period.

Figure 6 shows that larger ARs generally do take a longer
time to emerge, but that the relationship between emergence time
and peak ﬂux is not a simple one, with some regions taking a
long time to emerge without reaching a particularly high peak
ﬂux. The rates of ﬂux emergence were seen to vary, both dur-
ing the emergence of single regions and from one AR to another

in agreement with the results of Poisson et al. (2015, 2016) ob-
tained on other sets of ARs. Some regions were seen to have an
initial gradual emergence phase followed by a more rapid phase,
while others emerged rapidly at the start and had a decreasing
emergence rate later on.

The ratio of ﬂux to peak magnetic ﬂux is used in Figure 7
to study the emergence independent of the time it takes. Here
the maximum ﬂux is computed separately for the two magnetic
polarities. Moreover, in order to separate the emergence from
the decay phase (which are in the same range of ﬂux) we use the
function f (F) deﬁned as

f (F/Fmax) = F/Fmax

= 2 − F/Fmax

for t ≤ tmax
for t > tmax ,

(12)

where t is the time since the start of emergence, Fmax is the max-
imum ﬂux and tmax the duration of the emergence until Fmax is

Fig. 7. Similar to Figure 5, this plot shows the evolution of the slope. Here, the slope is plotted against a function of the normalised
magnetic ﬂux. This normalised ﬂux is deﬁned as the ratio of the AR ﬂux to the peak ﬂux that region achieves. The peak ﬂux and the
ratios are found separately for the positive and negative magnetic polarities. To distinguish between emergence and decay phases,
the function f (F), deﬁned by Eq. (12), is used in abscissa. The emergence phase is in the range [0, 1] and the decay phase is for
abscissa > 1. Second order polynomials were least-square ﬁtted, showing the general trend.

reached. Despite the issues arising due to variable emergence
rates, Figure 7 shows an improvement to Figure 5 in that the
trends, particularly in the case of the leading spot, are more pro-
nounced.

On average, there is an imbalance present in the slopes of the
ﬁeld distribution between the leading and following polarities.
At the beginning of the emergence phase the ﬁeld distribution
slope is slightly more negative for the following than the lead-
ing polarity, becoming less negative as the peak value of ﬂux is
reached. However, these diﬀerences, best seen in the ﬁtted poly-
nomials, are comparable to the standard deviation of the residu-
als. To reduce the statistical noise and investigate whether these
slopes are dependent upon parameters other than the normalised
ﬂux a larger sample of regions would need to be studied.

In summary, Figure 7 shows one important aspect of the
evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution, namely the trans-
formation of a distribution mainly dominated by the weak ﬁelds
(steeper slope), at the beginning of emergence, to one with more
numerous stronger ﬁeld pixels, around the maximum ﬂux, and
then back to a distribution dominated by weak ﬁeld pixels. The
typical slopes around the maximum ﬂux correspond to the slope
found with the simple model described in Section 2.1. In con-
trast, neither the initial emergence nor the decay phase conforms
with the plausible theoretical model we considered. In particular
the distribution during the beginning of the decay shows an evo-
lution opposite to that expected from classical diﬀusion (with the
slope becoming steeper rather than tending towards the expected
value −1 as found in Section 2.3).

5.3. Decayed ARs

The ARs selected for this study were ones that emerged on the
solar disk and were tracked until they rotated too far (≥ 60o)
from the central meridian. As such, all the data came from rela-
tively young ARs, up to just 6 days old. A preliminary study of
decaying ARs was performed to see if the decreasing slope trend
continues as ARs continue to age. Three relatively isolated de-
caying ARs (NOAA 12165, 12176 and 12414), in which no new
ﬂux emergence was observed, were selected. The ARs were cho-

from the start of the AR’s emergence. A downward trend can be
seen.

sen to be of approximately the same maximum ﬂux (∼ 5 × 1021
Mx), as this aﬀects how quickly the ARs decay and how quickly
their distribution changes. Two of these ARs started emerging
on the far side of the Sun, so their emergence start times were
identiﬁed by eye using 171 Å data from STEREO B. Two of
the regions were observed for multiple solar rotations, providing
data points at later times.

To calculate the ﬁeld distributions of these regions, all of the
pixels within a rectangular subplot centred on the AR were used.
This simple procedure was used, as at these times the ARs are
quite dispersed and diﬃcult to distinguish from the quiet Sun
ﬁeld. An example of one of the decaying ARs and the rectangu-
lar subplot that deﬁned the region is shown in the top left panel
of Figure 8, with the AR’s ﬁeld distribution shown in the bottom
left panel. The slopes of the three decaying ARs at the diﬀerent
times since they started emerging are shown in Figure 9. Here,
an average of the positive and negative slope values was used, as

distributions in the bottom left and right panels respectively. The positions of the knees, k1 and k2 (vertical lines), and the lines of

order polynomials were least-square ﬁtted, showing the general trend.

the slopes for the two diﬀerent polarities were consistently very
similar, in each case diﬀering by less than 0.1. This may not be
the case for an AR where the leading polarity retains a coherent
spot for longer than the following polarity.

The results shown in Figure 9 indicate that the downward
(steepening) trend of the slope during AR decay continues as

8

the regions continue to age. A deeper study is needed to conﬁrm
this result and to ﬁnd the dependence on maximum ﬂux.

S. Dacie et al.: Evolution of the Magnetic Field Distribution of Active Regions

5.4. Quiet Sun

At the end stages of AR decay, the dispersing magnetic ﬁeld
becomes part of the quiet Sun. We studied four regions to ﬁnd the
slope of the quiet Sun ﬁeld distribution. As for the decaying ARs
in Section 5.3, all the pixels within a selected rectangular area
were used to build the ﬁeld distribution. One of the four regions
and its distribution is shown as an example in the right column of
Figure 8. The regions studied were taken at central meridian on
2010-May-25 (shown in Figure 8), 2015-Nov-25, 2015-Dec-22
and 2016-Jan-18. The latter three regions were centered on -75
arcseconds in Solar Y.

The average of the positive and negative distribution slopes
were −3.0, −3.0, −2.9 and −3.3, with the diﬀerence between
the positive and negative being less than 0.3 for each region.
Combining this result with that of Figure 9, it implies that the
slope of the AR ﬁeld distribution continues to decrease (steepen)
as the AR decays, until reaching the quiet Sun value ∼ −3.

A possible origin of this ∼ −3 slope is the advection of the
magnetic ﬁeld by the diverging ﬂow of supergranules, as fol-
lows. With an axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld and purely radial
ﬂow at speed ur away from the cell centre, the ideal induction
equation in the stationary regime implies that Bz(r) ∝ 1/(r ur)
with r being the radial distance away from the cell centre.
Supposing that ur is nearly independent of r away from the cell
centre and boundary, implies that Bz ∝ 1/r. Comparing this to
Eq. (1) provides n ≈ 1 for r (cid:29) a, which produces a slope of −3
from Eq. (4). This rough approach assumes a very simple form
for the convective ﬂow and does not include other important
physical processes such as the ﬁeld concentration/cancellation at
the cell boundary. A detailed analysis of observations and/or nu-
merical simulations will be needed to test if the ∼ −3 slope found
in the quiet Sun is mainly due to the advection of the magnetic
ﬁeld by the diverging ﬂow of supergranules.

5.5. Possible Issues for the Derived Distributions

In this section we report some of the tests done to ensure that the
derived slopes in emerging ARs are not aﬀected by the inclusion
of surrounding quiet Sun or by projection eﬀects.

With regard to the area selection process (as described in
Section 3.2), we analysed the area bordering the ARs by select-
ing a ribbon-like region around the ARs and by studying the
ﬁeld distributions for various ribbon thickness. In the bordering
region we found a distribution that diﬀered from that of the quiet
Sun. As such, we decided to include these neighbouring pixels
in the selection by applying dilations. Care was taken to ensure
that the dilations were not too large, avoiding the inclusion of
decaying ﬁeld from old ARs nearby, which could be identiﬁed
by eye.

The quiet Sun region was also used to study possible eﬀects
arising from the position of the region on the solar disk with re-
spect to distance from the central meridian since we are using
the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld data. Contrary to ARs, the dis-
tribution of the quiet Sun is expected not to evolve on a time
scale of weeks, so any observed change of the observed distribu-
tion indicates a viewing point bias as the region shifts away from
the central meridian. The main change found in the distribution
was a shift of k1 to higher ﬁeld values. One reason for this is
the larger errors in the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld measurement
closer to the solar limb (Hoeksema et al. 2014). These errors are
then exaggerated by the cosine correction under the radial ﬁeld
assumption. Even if there were no errors in the measured ﬁeld
values, the validity of the assumption that the measurements are

Fig. 11. Schema summarising the evolution of the Bz distribution
with a log-log plot. It shows the diﬀerence in the distribution
between a newly emerging AR (green), one at around the time
of peak ﬂux (yellow) and one during the decay phase (blue).
After this time, the ﬁeld distribution of the AR evolves towards
that of the quiet Sun (red). Since both magnetic polarities have
very similar distributions at a given time (e.g., Figures 4 and 8)
they are not diﬀerentiated in this schema.

of a purely radial ﬁeld decreases for both low ﬁeld strength re-
gions (less vertical magnetic ﬁeld) and away from the disk cen-
tre, where the measured ﬁeld contains a larger component of the
transverse ﬁeld. This also introduces errors in the ﬁeld distribu-
tion.

A shift in k1 has implications for the slope, with a larger k1
in general giving rise to a steeper slope. The shift in k1 becomes
more pronounced ∼ 3 - 4 days from central meridian (∼ 45 - 60
degrees). In the AR sample analysed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, if
k1 was seen to increase signiﬁcantly as the region moves away
from the central meridian, then this and any following time steps
were removed from the analysis.

To further ensure that the trends seen in Figures 5 and 7 did
not result from the position of the AR on the disk in terms of area
foreshortening eﬀects and interpolations associated with derota-
tion, Figure 10 includes only data from ARs within 10 hours, ∼
6 degrees, of their central meridian passage. The regions were
in various stages of their evolution as they passed central merid-
ian. Figure 10 shows the same trends as were obtained with the
larger number of data points in Figure 7, with a slightly more
marked diﬀerence between the leading and following polarities.
Thus, we conclude that the trends in slope are related to the real
ﬁeld distributions of the ARs.

6. Discussion and Conclusions

In this study of 37 emerging ARs, we have shown that there is
a relationship between the slope of the vertical component of
the photospheric ﬁeld distribution and the age of an AR. This is
summarised in Figure 11. At the beginning of a region’s emer-
gence, the slope is steep and negative. The slope becomes less
steep, which indicates the coalescence of the fragmented ﬂux
that emerges. Later, the slope reaches a maximum just before
the region achieves its peak ﬂux value (at ∼ 0.75 − 0.8 peak
ﬂux), before the decay processes become dominant. The slope
becomes more negative as the region disperses and this decreas-

ing trend continues towards the quiet Sun slope value of ∼ −3
(Figure 8).

A comparison between the observational and theoretical re-
sults shows that a simple model of magnetic concentrations can
describe the ﬁeld (ﬂux density) distribution in emerging ARs
during the coalescence phase when smaller ﬂux concentrations
merge to form larger ones, leading to sunspot formation. The
model predicts a slope of ≈ −1.67 for n = 3, in good agreement
with the slope values found in observations of the coalescence
phase (Figures 5 and 7).

However,

later on there is a major deviation from the
classical-diﬀusion model in the decay phase, indicating that AR
magnetic ﬁelds do not disperse by simple diﬀusion. The latter
predicts that after reaching peak ﬂux, the ﬁeld strength distribu-
tion should be characterised by a slope which is evolving from
the range [−1.6, −1.4] towards the diﬀusion exponent value of
−1. However, as Figures 7 and 10 clearly demonstrate, once ARs
pass their peak ﬂux and start decaying, their ﬁeld strength distri-
bution slopes evolve quite diﬀerently from these expectations:
they start to attain higher negative values. Furthermore, ARs
measured in the later decay phase display slopes in the range of
[−2.3, −1.6], as shown in Figure 9, while the quiet Sun, which
can be regarded as the end-product of AR decay, shows a slope
≈ −3. How can we understand this behaviour, which is so clearly
opposite to the classical diﬀusion scenario?

We suggest that magnetic ﬂux reprocessing by convective
cells is responsible for the observed evolution of ﬁeld distri-
butions. Magnetic ﬂux is being gnawed away by granular and
supergranular convective cells, in agreement with the turbulent
diﬀusion model (e.g., Petrovay & Moreno-Insertis 1997), which
carry away ﬂux concentrations from the strong-ﬁeld area of ARs.
Petrovay & van Driel-Gesztelyi (1997) analysed various theoret-
ical models of sunspot decay using observational data of umbral
areas and found that the turbulent diﬀusion model was the only
model supported by the data. The turbulent diﬀusion model is
also consistent with the removal of active region magnetic ﬁeld
by moving magnetic features (e.g., Kubo et al. 2008), the move-
ment of which is a result of convective ﬂows. The advected ﬁeld
fragments become concentrated along the boundaries of super-
granular cells, where they occasionally meet and cancel with
opposite polarity ﬁeld. The cancelled ﬂux submerges and is re-
processed by convection. Part of the reprocessed ﬂux emerges
in the centre of supergranular cells as weak intranetwork ﬂux.
This process breaks up strong-ﬁeld ﬂux tubes and makes them
emerge as weaker ﬁeld, eﬀectively transferring strong ﬁeld to
weak ﬁeld in the ﬁeld distribution of a decaying AR, making the
slope of the ﬁeld distribution steeper (more negative). The weak
intranetwork ﬁeld is carried to the boundary of the supergranular
cells and becomes more concentrated there, which is a counter-
mechanism to the former scenario. We propose that the −3 slope
found in the quiet-Sun ﬁeld is the result of the combination of
these two mechanisms.

Although the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in a decaying
AR is very diﬀerent from what is expected in classical diﬀusion
(slope of −1), the AR area has previously been found to increase
approximately linearly with time (e.g., van Driel-Gesztelyi et al.
2003), in accordance with the classical diﬀusion model. Is there
a contradiction here? We propose that the increase of AR area is
due to the non-stationarity of the supergranular convective cells,
which have a lifetime of about one day. This non-stationarity
creates a random walk of the ﬂux tubes, which is the underlying
physics of classical diﬀusion. Therefore the AR evolution can
be seen as classical diﬀusion regarding area increase, while the
magnetic ﬁeld distribution is governed by magneto-convection.

10

These ideas have to be tested in simulations of emerging ARs
that include (or not) magneto-convection.

Other studies (e.g., Abramenko & Yurchyshyn 2010) have
characterised the active region magnetic ﬁeld by its degree of in-
termittency. It could be interesting to compare this with changes
in the ﬁeld distribution slopes as the resolution of the magne-
togram is decreased and particularly for resolutions which do
not resolve the highly intermittent small scale structure.
