Recent experiments revealed intriguing similarities in the 64Ni+207Pb,
132Xe+208Pb, and 238U+238U reactions at energies around the Coulomb
barrier. The experimental data indicate that for all systems substantial
energy dissipation takes place, in the ﬁrst stage of the reaction, although
the number of transferred nucleons is small. On the other hand, in the
second stage, a large number of nucleons are transferred with small fric-
tion and small consumption of time. To understand the observed be-
havior, various reactions were analyzed based on the microscopic time-
dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. From a systematic analysis for
40,48Ca+124Sn, 40Ca+208Pb, 40Ar+208Pb, 58Ni+208Pb, 64Ni+238U, 136Xe+
198Pt, and 238U+238U reactions, we ﬁnd that TDHF reproduces well the
measured trends. In addition, the Balian-V´en´eroni variational principle is
applied to head-on collisions of 238U+238U, and the variance of the frag-
ment masses is compared with the experimental data, showing signiﬁcant
improvement. The underlying reaction mechanisms and possible future
studies are discussed.

In heavy ion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier, a molecule-
like nuclear system can be formed, which is called a nuclear molecule [1] or

a dinuclear system [2], after mutual capture of projectile and target nu-
clei. At this stage, nucleons are exchanged actively and kinetic energy is
dissipated, while the system evolves towards the equilibrium. Because of
the strong Coulomb repulsion, the system can reseparate before compound
nucleus (CN) formation (quasiﬁssion, QF), typically on the timescale of
(10−21–10−20) sec, resulting in a characteristic correlation between fragment
masses and scattering angles [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The QF process signiﬁcantly
hinders fusion of heavy nuclei leading to, e.g., superheavy systems with
proton numbers well beyond Z = 100, where the fragility of the composite
systems is reﬂected by the small cross sections and short lifetimes of the
fusion-evaporation residues.

exit channel characteristics like mass, charge, angular and energy distri-
butions. Binary reactions in the superheavy collision systems 64Ni+207Pb
(Z = ZP + ZT = 110) [8] and 132Xe+208Pb (Z = 136) [9] were studied at the
velocity ﬁlter SHIP at GSI. In both cases, clear signatures for the forma-
tion of long-lived nuclear molecules which rotate by large angles of 180
degrees were observed. Even in collisions of 238U+238U (Z = 184), which
were investigated at the VAMOS spectrometer at GANIL [10], a noticeably
large interaction time was deduced. A comparison of the behavior of energy
dissipation, interaction times, and deformation reveals striking similarities
between these three systems. To understand the underlying reaction mech-
anism is the main purpose of the present article.

To describe damped collisions of heavy nuclei, various models have been
developed and applied: e.g. a dynamical model based on Langevin-type
equations of motion [11, 12], a dinuclear system model (DNS) [13, 14, 15, 16],
and an improved quantum molecular dynamics model (ImQMD) [17, 18,
19, 20]. Among those theoretical models, the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(TDHF) theory [21, 22] is regarded as a microscopic one which allows to
investigate nuclear structure and reaction dynamics in a uniﬁed way from
nucleonic degrees of freedom. Since a phenomenological input is only an
energy density functional (EDF), which is constructed to reproduce known
properties of ﬁnite nuclei and nuclear matter, it oﬀers non-empirical predic-
tions1. It has been shown that TDHF provides a fairly good description of
averaged reaction outcomes, e.g., mass and charge numbers of reaction prod-
ucts, total kinetic energy loss (TKEL) and scattering angle. Recent studies

1 We note that although EDF dependence of TDHF results has not been well studied
to date, and should be studied in future, QF dynamics (orientation dependence, shell
eﬀects, contact time, etc.) in, e.g., the 64Ni+238U reaction with SLy5 in Ref. [23] and
in the 48Ca,50Ti+249Bk reactions with SLy4d in Ref. [24] shows very similar features.

demonstrated that the theory provides a reliable description also for deep-
inelastic and QF processes in collisions of heavy nuclei [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].
Here, we employ the TDHF theory to understand the experimental data.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we outline the experimental
methods of SHIP at GSI and VAMOS at GANIL. In Sec. 3, we recall the
theoretical framework of TDHF. In Sec. 4, we present the experimental and
theoretical results and discuss underlying reaction mechanisms. In Sec. 5,
a summary and a perspective are given.

In the following we brieﬂy summarize our experimental methods. For
detailed descriptions, we refer readers to Ref. [30] for the velocity ﬁlter SHIP
at GSI and Ref. [31] for the VAMOS spectrometer at GANIL.

The experiments on 64Ni+207Pb and 132Xe+208Pb were performed at the
velocity ﬁlter SHIP at GSI. We used SHIP to separate target-like transfer
and QF products, emitted to forward angles of (0
2) degrees, from primary
beam and background events. The reaction products which passed SHIP
were implanted in a position sensitive silicon strip detector where they were
identiﬁed by α decay tagging. A large region of α emitters was populated
in both experiments where we identiﬁed nuclei with 84
89. We
measured velocity spectra for each isotope by scanning stepwise the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld values of SHIP and registering the yields of the identiﬁed
nuclei at each setting. The velocity spectra deliver all essential information
about formation and evolution of nuclear molecules, namely, about energy
dissipation, lifetimes and rotation as well as on the deformation of the exit
channel nuclei at the scission point.

The experiments on 238U+238U were performed at the VAMOS spec-
trometer at GANIL where we measured excitation functions of binary reac-
tion products at ﬁve diﬀerent beam energies around the Coulomb barrier.
The reaction products were detected at angles of (35
5) degrees. VA-
MOS was used in a pure quadrupole mode. The magnetic rigidity Bρ was
optimized for the detection of transfer products with masses below ura-
nium. The following detection system was used for particle identiﬁcation
and trajectory reconstruction: (i) a secondary electron detector for time-of-
ﬂight (TOF) measurements (start signal) and to trigger the data acquisi-
tion, (ii) two drift chambers for determining the positions (x, y) and scat-
tering angles, (iii) an ionization chamber to measure the energy loss ∆E,
(iv) a 500 µm thick Si wall to measure the residual energy and for TOF
measurement (stop signal). From these parameters we obtained the mass
number A and the proton number Z of the reaction products. The reso-
lutions of A and Z were ∆A/A = 2% (FWHM) and ∆Z/Z = 6% (FWHM).
The lowest accessible cross sections were about 1 µb.

3. Theoretical framework

In this section, we brieﬂy recall the theoretical framework of the TDHF
theory [21, 22]. In TDHF, the many-body wave function of the system is
expressed as a single Slater determinant for all times,

Φ(r1σ1, . . . , rN σN , t) =

1
√N !

det
{

φi(rjσjqj, t)
}

,

(1)

where N (= NP + NT) is the total number of nucleons in the system, and
φi(rσq, t) (i = 1, . . . , N ) denotes the single-particle orbitals of the ith nu-
cleon. r, σ, and q are spatial, spin, and isospin coordinates, respectively.
The Pauli exclusion principle is thus ensured during the entire time evolu-
tion. The time evolution of the single-particle orbitals is governed by the
TDHF equations,

i~ ∂φi(rσq, t)
∂t

= ˆh(t)φi(rσq, t),

(2)

where ˆh(t) is the single-particle Hamiltonian which is dependent on single-
particle orbitals at each time through various densities and is derived from
appropriate functional derivatives of an EDF. The initial state for TDHF
calculations is taken as a product of Slater determinants for Hartree-Fock
(HF) ground states of projectile and target nuclei boosted with a relative
velocity. The relative velocity is evaluated assuming the Rutherford trajec-
tory. By solving the TDHF equations (2) with this initial wave function,
the whole reaction dynamics, e.g., energy dissipation, nucleon transfer, neck
formation, QF or fusion, is described in real-space and real-time, from nucle-
onic degrees of freedom. We note that in TDHF calculations for heavy-ion
reactions outlined above, neither adjustable parameters nor empirical as-
sumptions on the dynamics are introduced.

4. Results and discussion

First, we show the experimental results for 64Ni+207Pb (Ec.m. = 289 MeV),
132Xe+208Pb (Ec.m. = 492 MeV), and 238U+238U (Ec.m. = 875 MeV) reac-
tions (Fig. 1). The lightest system, Ni + Pb, can still undergo fusion leading
to isotopes of the element darmstadtium [32]. Therefore, one can expect sig-
natures of formation of long-living nuclear molecules in this system. While
the proton number of the composite system U + U is far beyond the one
of the heaviest known elements and fusion reactions cannot be expected
any more, it should give insight into the stability of the heaviest accessi-
ble systems. To probe the stability and time evolution of the composite
nuclear systems, we investigate energy dissipation (i.e. TKEL), interaction
times, and quadrupole deformation of the exit channel nuclei at the scission

point. The deformation was extracted assuming that the binary reaction
products have the same quadrupole deformation and TKE is determined by
the Coulomb potential at the scission point [9].

In Fig. 1, we show experimentally measured TKEL (a), interaction times
(b), and quadrupole deformation (c) as a function of the fraction of trans-
ferred nucleons dA/ACN, where ACN denotes the total number of nucleons
in the composite system. Figure 1 exhibits striking similarities between
the diﬀerent collision systems as well as between the diﬀerent parameters
(TKEL, interaction time, and deformation). Two stages of the reaction pro-
cess are especially revealed by the behavior of TKEL and interaction times.
The ﬁrst stage (dA < 0.05ACN) is characterized by a steep increase of these
values, meaning that a large amount of energy is dissipated which consumes
a lot of time but only a small number of nucleons are transferred. This is
the transition regime from quasi-elastic to deep-inelastic reactions. After a
net transfer of about 5% of the total number of nucleons in the composite
system, the curves turn and approach a saturation value.
In this second
stage, the situation reverses and a large amount of nucleons can ﬂow with
small friction and small consumption of time.

It is striking that the slope change of TKEL and interaction times occurs,
for so diﬀerent systems like Ni + Pb and U + U, always after the net transfer
of about 5% of the total number of nucleons. Also the three TKEL values
from Xe + Pb indicate a similar trend. The evolution of the nuclear shapes
shown in Fig. 1 (c) exhibits a somewhat steeper increase of the deformation
at the beginning of the reaction, while in total the slope of the curves is
more uniform than in TKEL (a) and interaction times (b). This indicates
that the shape evolution proceeds more uniformly with increasing nucleon
transfer than TKEL and the interaction time.

To understand the observed behavior, in the following, we investigate
results of TDHF calculations and make a possible comparison with the
experimental data. Nowadays it is feasible to systematically perform 3D
TDHF calculations for various projectile-target combinations, impact pa-
rameters, and incident energies [23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39], using a par-
allel computational code which works on hundreds of CPUs with MPI and
OpenMP [39]. We show results for various systems, namely, 40Ca+124Sn
(Ec.m. = 129 MeV), 48Ca+124Sn (Ec.m. = 125 MeV), 40Ca+208Pb (Ec.m. =
209 MeV), 58Ni+208Pb (Ec.m. = 257 MeV) [33], 64Ni+238U (Ec.m. = 307 MeV)
[23], 136Xe+198Pt (Ec.m. = 484 MeV) [39], 40Ar+208Pb (Ec.m. = 218 MeV),
and 238U+238U (Ec.m. = 875 MeV). For all results presented here, Skyrme
SLy5 parameter set [40] was used for the EDF. TDHF calculations were
performed for various impact parameters, typically 0–10 fm, for a given inci-
dent energy (except for 238U+238U, see below). For the 64Ni+238U reaction,
three initial orientations of deformed 238U (prolate, β

fects in the present article, as it requires additional computational eﬀort.

First, we discuss the reaction mechanisms suggested by the TDHF calcu-
lations for various systems. In Fig. 2, TKEL, divided by the center-of-mass

Let us ﬁrst focus on the cases where the average number of transferred
nucleons is small, a few percent of the total number of nucleons of the sys-
tem. They correspond to (quasi)elastic and grazing reactions. In Fig. 2, the
TDHF results exhibit a prominent increase of TKEL up to 20–35% of Ec.m.
and of contact time up to about 1 zs. This trend is common for all systems
examined here. After the rapid increase, TKEL is saturated, meaning that
the available energy is fully transferred from the relative motion to internal
degrees of freedom. Note that for 40,48Ca+124Sn (purple squares and gray
asterisks) with a relatively small charge product (ZPZT = 1000) the results
end before the TKEL saturation since the system fused easily at smaller
impact parameters. The TDHF results indicate that full energy dissipation
is quickly achieved at the ﬁrst stage of the reaction.

Next let us look at the cases where the average number of transferred
nucleons is greater than a few percent of the total number of nucleons of
the system. They correspond to trajectories at smaller impact parameters.
In such cases, a dinuclear system connected with a thick neck is formed in
the course of the collision and its shape evolution dynamics is responsible
for the amount of nucleon transfer. As the impact parameter decreases, two
nuclei collide more deeply, forming a more compact system connected with a
thicker neck. It makes the contact time longer and the system evolves more
towards the mass symmetry. It results in the behavior shown in Fig. 2 (b)
that indicates a correlation between the amount of mass transfer and the
contact time. In addition, Fig. 2 (a) shows a tendency that the TKEL de-
creases as the number of transferred nucleons increases (dAL/ACN & 10%).
This is due to the fact that a larger mass transfer means also a larger proton
transfer in this QF regime. As the number of transferred protons increases,
the charge product of the fragments increases, which results in larger ki-
netic energy and, thus, smaller TKEL. The TDHF results indicate that, in

the second stage of the reaction, a large number of nucleons are collectively
transferred via shape (mean-ﬁeld) evolution dynamics in the composite sys-
tem.

It is worth noting here similarities and diﬀerences of the TDHF results
for diﬀerent systems. In Fig. 2 (a), it is shown that the saturated values
of TKEL for 40Ca+208Pb, 58Ni+208Pb, and 64Ni+238U (z-direction, blue
open triangles) are very similar to each other, about 25% of Ec.m.. On
the other hand, the TKEL saturates at larger values, about 30–35% of
Ec.m., for 40Ar+208Pb, 136Xe+198Pt, and 64Ni+238U (x- and y-direction,
red circles and green crosses) reactions. In the latter case, the signiﬁcance
of nuclear orientations has been pointed out [23]. We note that the y-
direction case (close to side collisions) results in larger energy dissipation
compared with the x-direction case (close to tip collisions), for which one
may expect the opposite trend since the barrier height is higher in the
side collisions. Signiﬁcant roles of the shape evolution dynamics and shell
eﬀects of 208Pb in those damped collisions were extensively discussed in
Ref. [23]. In the 40Ar+208Pb and 136Xe+198Pt reactions, the situation is

with the other cases (Ec.m./VB
1.37 and 1.19, respectively). Because of
this fact, a larger amount of energy is brought into the system that leads
to a larger maximum value of TKEL (note also that in the 136Xe+198Pt
reaction no fusion reaction was observed and larger TKEL is achieved at
smaller impact parameters). Moreover, we observed several fusion-ﬁssion
like processes in the 40Ar+208Pb reaction where the composite system splits
in an almost symmetric way after a long contact time (
20 zs) which

Here, let us make a possible comparison between the TDHF results and
the experimental data. As mentioned above, the TDHF results correspond
to contributions from main (most probable) trajectories with various scat-

On the other hand, the experiment on U + U at the VAMOS spectrome-
ter at GANIL [10] was optimized for detecting fragments around the grazing
angle, which is relevant to the TDHF results for various systems shown in
Fig. 2 (we expect that the universal behavior observed for other systems
will also hold for U + U). In Fig. 1 (a), the experimental data show a rapid
increase of TKEL for dA/ACN < 5%, while it is almost saturated for larger
mass transfers. This behavior agrees with the reaction mechanisms deduced
by TDHF, where substantial energy dissipation takes place even with trans-
fer of a small number of nucleons. Moreover, in Ref. [10] measurements were
performed for several incident energies, and it was revealed that TKE of the
fragments becomes almost energy independent as the number of transferred
nucleons increases, dA/ACN & 3%. It is consistent with the observation in
TDHF where full energy dissipation is quickly achieved and a large num-
ber of nucleons are transferred via the shape evolution dynamics in the
composite system.

The experimental data shown in Fig. 1 (b) indicate that a remarkable
time delay (up to around 4 zs) may still occur even for the heaviest accessible
system U + U. The interaction time was deduced from the measured variance
of the fragment masses σ2
A = 2DAτ , given by
a diﬀusion model [43], where DA is the mass diﬀusion coeﬃcient (6.0
×
1022 s−1 for this reaction [10]) and τ is the interaction time. In order to
investigate reaction mechanisms further, we performed exploratory TDHF
calculations for head-on collisions of 238U+238U at Ec.m. = 875 MeV with
three conﬁgurations, i.e., tip-on-tip, tip-on-side, and side-on-side collisions,
where in the side-on-side conﬁguration the symmetry axes of two 238U were

aligned. The results are shown in Fig. 2 by black stars.

In the experiment [10], it has been clariﬁed that more than 90% of the
deep inelastic fragments resulted from τ < 2 zs. From the TDHF calcu-
lations, we have obtained the contact times of 1.97 zs (tip-on-tip), 1.64 zs
(tip-on-side), and 1.62 zs (side-on-side), which are consistent with the exper-
imental observation. Although the contact time is rather short, substantial
energy dissipation takes place. The values of TKEL/Ec.m. are 0.37 (tip-on-
tip), 0.30 (tip-on-side), and 0.26 (side-on-side), which are again consistent
with the experimental values shown in Fig. 1 (a).

One may notice that, even in this symmetric system, reaction products
can be diﬀerent from 238U. The reason is two-fold. One is due to the broken
reﬂection symmetry in the tip-on-side collision, which allows the system to
split in an asymmetric way. In this process, about 11.2 neutrons and 6.6
protons are transferred on average from tip-aligned 238U to the other, con-
sistent with earlier studies [44, 45]. The other reason is due to a ternary
QF process observed in the tip-on-tip collision. In the latter case, an ex-
tremely long (more than 10 fm) neck is developed when the system evolves
towards the reseparation. The long neck becomes thinner at two points and
eventually raptures producing a small third fragment in between two heavy
nuclei. We observed a beryllium-like nucleus (Z
6.5) as the third
fragment. The formation of ternary fragments in tip-on-tip collisions of
238U+238U was also reported in Ref. [44]. In this way, TDHF predicts sig-
niﬁcant impacts of nuclear orientations on the fragment masses in collisions
of two well-deformed actinide nuclei.

Finally, we investigate the variance of the fragment masses σ2

A in the
238U+238U reaction. Although TDHF provides a fairly good description for
averaged quantities, it substantially underestimates the variance of the frag-
ment masses. Thus one has to go beyond the standard mean-ﬁeld descrip-
tion [46, 47, 48, 49]. Here, we examine the variance employing the Balian-
V´en´eroni (BV) variational principle [47] which enables to include ﬂuctua-
tions and correlations around the mean-ﬁeld trajectory. For tip-on-side and
side-on-side collisions, where we observed binary reaction products3, the BV
prescription gives σ2
236.4 and 148.2, respectively, which are signiﬁcantly
larger than those by TDHF, σ2
10.5 and 9.6. For the tip-on-side and side-
on-side collisions, we have TKEL values of 263 and 224 MeV, respectively,
and experimental values corresponding to those TKEL values are σ2
400
and 250 (cf. Fig. 13 of Ref. [10]). Although this is a crude comparison, as
calculations were performed only for head-on collisions and the experimen-
tal variance is very sensitive to TKEL values, one can see that remarkable
improvement is achieved by the BV prescription. We note that the experi-

mental data may be inﬂuenced by the orientation dependence, as deduced
by TDHF calculations, as well as secondary processes (particle evaporation
and ﬁssion), which may increase the variance of the fragment masses, σ2
A.

5. Summary and perspective

We have performed theoretical and experimental studies on the stability
of heavy and superheavy nuclear systems with total proton numbers up
to Z = 184 by investigating nuclear molecule formation and time delays in
deep-inelastic binary reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier.

The experimental data for 64Ni+207Pb (Ec.m. = 289 MeV) [8], 132Xe+208Pb

(Ec.m. = 492 MeV) [9], and 238U+238U (Ec.m. = 875 MeV) [10] show striking
similarities in the behavior of energy dissipation, interaction times, and de-
formation of the fragment nuclei. In the ﬁrst stage of the reaction, where the
amount of nucleon transfer is less than 5% of the total number of nucleons
in the composite system, a lot of time is spent to move only a small number
of nucleons and large energy is transferred into internal excitations. In the
second stage, the interaction time increases slowly even if a large number
of nucleons are transferred. The observed similarities indicate that a sig-
niﬁcant time delay may still occur even in the heaviest accessible system
U + U.

To understand the observed behavior, we have carried out a comparative
study between results of TDHF calculations for various systems [40Ca+124Sn
(Ec.m. = 129 MeV), 48Ca+124Sn (Ec.m. = 125 MeV), 40Ca+208Pb (Ec.m. =
209 MeV), 40Ar+208Pb (Ec.m. = 218 MeV), 58Ni+208Pb (Ec.m. = 257 MeV),
64Ni+238U (Ec.m. = 307 MeV), 136Xe+198Pt (Ec.m. = 484 MeV), and 238U+
238U (Ec.m. = 875 MeV)] and the experimental data. From the results of the
TDHF calculations for diﬀerent systems, we have found similar trends as
observed in the experimental data.

≈

The TDHF results have revealed occurrence of two distinct transfer
mechanisms. In the grazing regime, a small number of nucleons are trans-
ferred through a fast charge equilibration process. At this stage substantial
20–35%) takes place in a relatively short
energy dissipation (TKEL/Ec.m.
period (about 1–2 zs) and available kinetic energy is fully dissipated. This
represents a rapid transition from quasi-elastic to deep-inelastic and QF
regimes. As the impact parameter decreases, two nuclei collide more deeply
forming a dinuclear system connected with a thick neck. In the latter case
shape evolution dynamics of the composite system is responsible for the
amount of nucleon transfer. A large number of nucleons are eﬀectively
transferred via the shape evolution dynamics, while all kinetic energy is
already fully dissipated.

TDHF calculations were also performed for head-on collisions of 238U+

238U (Ec.m. = 875 MeV) with three orientations, i.e., tip-on-tip, tip-on-side,
and side-on-side collisions. The results of TKEL and contact time are in
reasonable agreement with the experimental data. In the tip-on-tip collision,
we have observed a ternary QF process, where a small third fragment is
generated from the neck region between two heavy nuclei. In the tip-on-
side collision, the broken reﬂection symmetry allows the composite system
to split in an asymmetric way, resulting in transfer of many nucleons from
tip-aligned 238U to the other. Moreover, the Balian-V´en´eroni variational
principle was applied to investigate the variance of the fragment masses in
the U + U system, showing signiﬁcant improvement compared with TDHF.

A careful observation of the experimental data revealed striking similar-
ities between Ni + Pb and U + U systems that the slope change of TKEL
and interaction times occurs always after the net transfer of about 5% of the
total number of nucleons. We could not yet draw a conclusion if a physical
meaning is behind or it is just by chance. We consider that further analy-
ses of diﬀerent reactions measured at SHIP or VAMOS will provide useful
information, which we leave as a future task.

It has been shown that the microscopic TDHF theory can be a promis-
ing tool to investigate the QF dynamics in heavy and superheavy systems.
The theory provides valuable insight into the complex QF dynamics from
nucleonic degrees of freedom, thus, taking into account shell eﬀects dur-
ing the collision process. Recently, it has been suggested, based on the
Langevin model, that multinucleon transfer and QF processes are useful to
produce neutron-rich (super)heavy nuclei which have not been produced to
date, where shell eﬀects are predicted to play an important role (see, e.g.,
[50]). In principle, TDHF can also describe the predicted shell-eﬀect driven
transfer processes, and an extensive analysis is in progress [51].

Last but not least, there is an open problem that how and to what extent
the pairing correlations aﬀect the reaction dynamics in damped collisions
of heavy nuclei. The so-called time-dependent superﬂuid local density ap-
proximation (TDSLDA) (or time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov the-
ory, TDHFB) would provide a satisfactory answer to it, although it requires
about 100–1000 times larger computational cost compared with that for
the TDHF calculation. Very recently, it has become possible to perform 3D
TDSLDA calculations for nuclear systems using leadership-class supercom-
puters with hundreds of GPUs [52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. On one hand, pairing
eﬀects should disappear as the excitation energy increases, on the other
hand the additional degrees of freedom associated with complex pairing
ﬁeld dynamics may still alter the QF timescale in a similar way as observed
in 240Pu induced ﬁssion process [54]. A study along this line is in progress
[57], and the results will be published elsewhere.
