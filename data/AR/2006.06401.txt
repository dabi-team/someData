Abstract 

Gas electron multipliers (GEMs) with wire (WGEMs) or metal electrodes (MGEMs), which don’t 

use any plastic insulators between the electrodes are created. The absence of plastic insulation between 
the electrodes of WGEMs excludes unwanted leakage currents and spark breakdowns between the 
electrodes. Accidental spark events in such MGEM don’t lead to their failure as far as positive ions 
quickly move away from the breakdown region by a strong electric field in the gap region. In this work, 
we present a review of such GEMs. 

The chambers containing MGEMs (WGEMs) with pin-anodes are proposed as detectors for 

searching of interactions between Dark Matter particles and hydrogen (H2). In this paper, we present a 
review of such chambers. For investigation of the gas mixtures (Ar+10% H2, Ne+10%H2, H2 + 
3ppmTMAE), the chamber containing WGEM with pin-anodes detection system was constructed. In this 
paper we present the results of an experimental study of these gaseous mixtures exited by an alpha 
source. 

Finally, we discuss principles of operation of GEMs with pin-anodes as well as plans for 

constructing of large scale (150 mm x 150 mm) MGEM detectors.

1. Introduction 

More than forty years ago G. Charpak and F. Sauli have introduced their Multi-Step Chambers to 
overcome limitations of gain in Parallel-Plate and Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) [1]. These 
MWPCs have revolutionized detection systems in high energy physics. 

Currently there are different types of detectors for fast detection and localization of charged 

particles exist. One of them is a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). A standard Gas Electron Multiplier [2,3,4] 
consists of a thin composite sheet (plate) with two metal layers separated by a thin insulator and 
pierced by a regular matrix of open channels. These plates contain through holes on all their area, 
separation distances and diameters of which are approximately equal to the plate thickness (Fig.1). 
Inside these holes, which are filled with corresponding gases, in presence of strong electric fields, a 
multiplication of electrons takes place. GEMs provide the best spatial resolution and higher rate than 
the wire chambers (MWPC). More coarse macro-patterned detectors are thick-GEMs (THGEM) [5, 6, 7] 
or patterned resistive thick GEM devices (RETGEM) [8]. 

However, the most essential disadvantage of GEMs consists in their low reliability and stability. 

The matter is that in a process of dispersion of the GEM’s cathode electrodes by positive ions of 

 
 
 
proportional avalanches in GEM with metal or high-resistive electrodes (RETGEM), a sedimentation of 
the sprayed carrying-out material on the walls of holes with subsequent leaks and breakdowns between 
electrodes takes place. It leads to subsequent decrease of the potential difference between GEM’s 
electrodes and corresponding reduction of the multiplication factor in an avalanche. 

Micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGD), due to their tiny electrode structure and small 
avalanche gaps, are very fragile and can be easily damaged by sparks appearing at high operational gains 
(typically at gains of 104 or slightly more) [7]. 

Therefore, we were concentrated on development of more robust designs of GEM detectors 

with wire (WGEM) or metal electrodes (MGEM). The idea of WGEM without plastic insulators was first 
mentioned in our work [9]. In our subsequent works [10, 11] a MGEM with metal electrodes of diameter 
of 22 mm was designed and tested. In our next works [15-19, 21, 25] it was suggested that the search 
WIMP of Dark Matter with help of detecting system with GEMs can be performed. In the paper [13] we 
have described a novel concept of MGEMs.

2. GEMs with wire electrodes (WGEM) 

 In our works [9, 10, 11] WGEMs with wire electrodes and no plastic insulators between 

them were created. The WGEMs [9] used macroscopic windows of size 1 mm by 1 mm, while 
WGEMs [10, 11] used windows of size 0,5 mm by 0,5 mm.  The gap between the wire electrodes 
was equal to 1 mm. The design of wire GEMs and the results of their tests are shown in Fig.2 and 
Fig.3.

3. GEM with metal electrodes (MGEM) 

  In the work [12] a MGEM with metal electrodes and sensitive area of 22 mm by 22 mm for the 
first time was demonstrated. The electrodes were made by drilling of 1 mm holes with a step between 
them of 1.5 mm in to 1 mm thick brass plates (see Fig.4). One disadvantage of that MGEM [12] is large 
duration of the process of drilling the holes in the electrodes, especially for a case of small diameters 
and small steps between holes. In addition to that, formation of agnails at the edges of holes in a 
process of drilling is possible. Another problem of drilling of holes with drilling machines consists in 
difficulty of production of large area MGEM electrodes with high accuracy of sizes of holes and their 
positions on various plates.

4. MGEM with the etching of holes 

In the work [13] the gas electron multiplier with metal electrodes (MGEM), differing by its 
simplicity, high precision and technological effectiveness in production, as well as reliability and stability 
of its operation, is made and tested. To eliminate certain specific shortcomings (see Introduction), in this 
work metal electrodes were made by a method of drawing a mask on 0.3 mm thick brass plates with 0.3 
mm diameter holes and 0.5 mm step between them (fig.5) with subsequent double-side etching of the 
holes. 

 
 
As far as the initial brass plate was cut from 0.3 mm thick rolled foil, the produced electrodes 

had a curved shape. Therefore, at assembling, between the MGEM electrodes a fluoroplastic spacer was 
introduced to increase resistance on the pass of leakage charges between the electrodes. From the 
outer sides both electrodes were pressed to fluoroplastic plate by additional steel rings of 2 mm 
thickness.  

 By means of central 4 mm holes in electrodes and special insulating bolts, the GEM electrodes 

were mutually positioned in such a way that the relative displacements of holes didn’t exceed 0.02 mm. 
The gap between electrodes was chosen to be equal to 1 mm.  In this design a sensitive area GEM with 
holes had a diameter of D=75 mm. The GEM was tested in the chamber (Fig.6.) with various filling gases: 
Ar +10%C2H4 (1 and 0.4 atm), Ne +((O2 +N2 +H2O)∙10-6)(1 and 0.4 atm), Ar +10% CH4 (1 atm).     

The results of tests at irradiation of the drift gap of the chamber by alpha-particles (Pu239 ) are 

presented in Fig.5. It is visible, that Ne provides the maximum coefficient of multiplication at the 
smallest potential difference between electrodes before the breakdown happens.

5. The detecting chambers with system GEM + pin-anodes for Direct Detection of WIMP 

In work [15] the idea of focusing screen with holes + system pin-anodes already was shown 

(section 5.1). The wire gas electron multipliers in combination with pin-anodes are proposed for 
detection of events: in the gas phase of a double-phase argon chamber (section 5.2); in chamber for 
direct detection of WIMP with mass ≤ 0.5 GeV (section 5.3); and in chamber with gas mixture H2 + 3ppm 
TMAE (section 5.4). 

5.1 A liquid-methane ionization chamber  

A liquid-methane ionization chamber with a system of focusing screen + pin-anodes is proposed 

as a setup to search for spin-dependent interactions of DM particles with hydrogen [15]. The Anode of 
the chamber is placed in gaseous methane above liquid methane. The anode consists of a system of 
pins. The Focusing screen is placed between the Anode and liquid methane. The screen has a system of 
holes concentrically on the relevant pin-anode. The values of electrical potentials on the electrodes of 
the chamber are set in such a way that all electrical lines of force are focused on the pin-anodes. We 
provide only the idea of using a specially designed liquid-methane ionization chamber in an experiment 
aimed at searching for the (mostly) low mass DM based on their spin-dependent interactions with 
hydrogen. 

5.2 Double-Phase Argon Chamber 

Multichannel WGEM + system pin-anodes are proposed for detection of events in the gas phase 
of a double-phase argon chamber [16, 17]. Hydrogen with a concentration of 10 % is added to argon to 
eliminate feedbacks via photons emitted by excited argon molecules in avalanche development 
processes during detection of events in the gaseous argon. A maximum electron multiplication 
coefficient of 
300 has been obtained for the multichannel wire gas electron multipliers with a 1 mm 
gap used to detect α-particles in the Ar + 10% H2 mixture at a pressure of 1 bar. When a pin anode is 
used, the maximum electron multiplication factor for α-particles is 
experimentally shown that adding H2 with a concentration of 100 ppm to liquid argon has no effect on 
the singlet component of the scintillation signal in the liquid argon and reduces the emission efficiency 
relative to the pure argon gas phase only slightly (by 20%).

 To suppress the β, γ and n0 backgrounds, the comparison of scintillation and ionization signals 

for every event is suggested [18, 19]. The addition in liquid Ar of photosensitive TMA, TMG or C2H4 [20] 
and suppression of triplet component of scintillation signals ensures the detection of scintillation signals 
with high efficiency and provides a complete suppression of the electron background. 

5.3 The Chamber for Direct Detection of WIMP with Mass ≤ 0.5 GeV. 

The chamber for direct detection of WIMP with mass ≤ 0.5 GeV was developed [21]. The 
chamber (see Fig.7) is filled with gas mixture Ne+10% Hydrogen +0,15ppm TMG. In this chamber for the 
events detection it was used a system GEM +pin-anodes, which provide the energy threshold about eV. 
The electron background is suppressed due to photosensitive addition of TMG. For a direct detection of 
WIMP it is proposed to use a liquid argon chamber with Hydrogen dissolved in liquid argon at a 
concentration 100ppm+0,015ppm TMG. Based on the work [22], where in a spherical proportional 
detector the energy threshold is about 100eV, while the amplification factor of the detecting system   is 
about 104, we estimate the threshold of our experiment to be about 100 eV∙104/5∙107 1eV. The H2-filling 
provides an efficient suppression of the electron background, because of the short track of recoil 
protons, compared to the one from background electrons [23].

detection system (Fig.8).  Coefficient of electron multiplication simultaneously in the WGEM (Kamp1 ~ 
102) and at the pin-anode (Kamp2 ~ 5∙105) as a function of the anode voltage. The chamber is filled with 
a mixture of Ne+10% at a pressure of 1 bar is exposed to α particles. 

5.4 The chamber with gas mixture H2 + 3ppm TMAE 

The detectors with pure NaI, Xe or Ar [24, 26] make it possible to search WIMPs with large 

masses (up to dozens or hundreds GeV), as far as the energy of nuclear recoils in these detectors from 
low mass WIMPs is low. To account for yearly modulation effect in DAMA-LIBRA experiment [27] 
J.Va’vra has supposed [29] that this effect is explained by low mass WIMP scattered at protons in H2O 
molecules, which is contained in NaI crystals at about 1ppm level (see Table 1.) 

In our work [25] the chamber for direct detection of WIMPs with mass < 10 Gev/c2 and axions, 
emitted from the Sun, was developed. The chamber is filled with a gas mixture H2 +3ppm TMAE (5, 10 
bar), or D2 + 3ppm TMAE. These gas fillings allow to suppress the electron background. For detection of 
events is used a system GEM + pin-anodes (Fig.8) with coefficient multiplication of about 105 (see Fig.9 ) 
and the chamber of the previous experiment (section 5.3). Collisions of WIMPs with H2 provide recoil 
protons with energies of several keV (see Table 1). An addition of TMAE with a low ionization potential 
(5,36 eV) provides detection of recoil protons.

6. Operation principle of MWPC, GEM and system GEM+pin-anode 

The operation principle of Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (a), GEM (b) and system GEM + 

pin-anode (c) is illustrated in Fig.10. The factors which have allowed us to obtain high electron 
multiplication factors in the GEM + pin-anode system are as follows: 

(1) High electric field strength in the system GEM + pin-anode makes it possible to obtain a big 

length of electron avalanche and high value of the electron multiplication factor (106-107); 

(2) Positive ions from the avalanche at the pin are transferred by the electric field, mainly, to the 

walls of the hole in which the pin is located and, in smaller quantities, towards the ionization electrons 
being collected at the pin, which rules out the possibility of streamers being developed at the interface 
of the positive ion cloud and the electron avalanche [26];  

(3) For GEM (see technology b) extraction efficiency decrease at low transfer fields values due to 

a worst electron extraction capability from the lower side of the GEM [26];  

(4) Absence of a plastic insulation excludes the emergence of leakage current and spark 

breakdown between electrodes. Accidental spark events in such system don’t lead to their failure as 
positive ions quickly move away from breakdown by a strong electric gap field.

trajectories, also the drift of ions is indicated (blue paths). 

 We have also plans for constructing of large scale (150mmx150mm) MGEM + pin-anodes 

detectors (see Fig.11).

7. Discussion  

In works of CERN the multichannel gas electron multipliers consisting of a plastic plate 50-2000 
microns thick with metal or high-resistive thin (some microns) deposits from two parties are presented 
[2-4].  These GEMs provide the best spatial resolution and higher rate that wire chambers. However, an 
essential disadvantage of these GEM consists in their low reliability and stability. The matter is that at 
cathode dispersion by positive ions from proportional avalanches in GEM with metal or high-resistive 
electrodes there is a sedimentation of the sprayed carrying-out material on walls of holes takes place, 
which leads to subsequent leaks and breakdowns between electrodes.  

In our works GEMs with wire (WGEM) or metal electrodes (MGEM) and gas gap between metal 

electrodes without plastic insulators were created. Absence of a plastic insulation excludes the 
emergence of leakage current and spark breakdown between electrodes. 

8. Summary & Outlook 

In our works [9-14] GEMs with wire (WGEM) or metal electrodes (MGEM) and gas gap between 
metal electrodes without plastic were realized. An absence of a plastic insulation between electrodes of 
these GEMs excludes leakage currents and spark breakdowns between the electrodes. 

In our works [15-17, 21, 25] it was suggested to search low mass WIMPs with help of chambers 

with GEMs and systems WGEM (MGEM) + pin-anodes. In that respect we would like to add the next 
important comments:  

1. As far as WIMPs with large masses (> 10 GeV) experimentally were not found so far [24, 27, 

28, 29], it is necessary to search the WIMP with small masses (≤ 10 GeV/c2).  

2. The data of the new DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 confirm a peculiar annual modulation of the single-

hit scintillation events in the (1–6) keV energy range (WIMP mass < 10 GeV/c2) satisfying all of the 
multiple requirements of the Dark Matter [28]. J.Va’vra have supposed [29] that this effect is explained 
by low mass WIMP (  ̴1 GeV/c2) scattering on protons in H2O molecules (H+). 

 
  
 
 
Finally, we would like to mention that MGEMs can have various applications in medicine. Such 
MGEMs can be used in different medical instruments for their use in X-ray surgery or Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET), where a high operation stability and reliability of the whole complex of instrument is 
required. Recently we have proposed a PET system, based on these GEMs [30].
