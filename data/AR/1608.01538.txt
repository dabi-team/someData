News from strong interactions program of the
NA61/SHINE experiment ∗

00-662 Warsaw, Poland

The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of
strongly interacting matter and study the properties of the onset of decon-
ﬁnement. This is performed by a two dimensional phase diagram (T − µB)
scan of measurements of particle spectra and ﬂuctuations in proton-proton,
proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions as a function of collision
energy and system size. In this contribution new NA61/SHINE results on
negative pion production, as well as transverse momentum and multiplicity
ﬂuctuations in Ar+Sc collisions are presented. Moreover, the latest results
on higher order moments of net-charge multiplicity distribution in p+p col-
lisions are also discussed. The Ar+Sc results are compared to NA61 p+p
and Be+Be data, as well as to NA49 A + A results.

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is a ﬁxed-
target experiment pursuing a rich physics program including measurements
for strong interactions, neutrino, and cosmic ray physics. The main goal
of the strong interactions program is to study the characteristics of the
onset of deconﬁnement and search for the signatures of the critical point
(CP). Presently, there are several more projects at energies corresponding
to the SPS energy range: the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BNL, Brookhaven),
NICA (JINR, Dubna), and SIS-100/300 (FAIR GSI, Darmstadt). NA61 is
the ﬁrst experiment to perform a two-dimensional scan, in beam momentum
and mass number of colliding nuclei.

Contrary to collider experiments, the acceptance of NA61 starts from
pT = 0 MeV/c. This is crucial not only for the analysis of spectra and

yields, but also for the study of ﬂuctuations, because it is expected that
ﬂuctuations due to the CP mainly show up in low pT particles [1]. As will be
shown below, the rapidity coverage of NA61 is also very large. It essentially
covers the full forward hemisphere and extends below mid-rapidity allowing
to determine particle multiplicities in full phase-space (at RHIC only the
BRAHMS experiment has been able to measure 4π multiplicities).

In many experiments centrality selection is based on produced particle
multiplicity. But multiplicity-based event selection may bias multiplicity
ﬂuctuations! To avoid such a bias centrality is measured in NA61 using the
Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), a segmented calorimeter recording the
forward going energy EF with resolution of 1 nucleon in the studied energy
range. The PSD is located on the beam axis and detects mainly the non-
interacting nucleons of the beam nucleus. Intervals in EF allow to select
diﬀerent centrality classes. The PSD will also be used for determination of
the reaction plane in the future analysis of collective ﬂow.

The analysis methods in NA61 are also unique and innovative. The
identity method [2, 3, 4], allowing to unfold the eﬀect of imperfect particle
identiﬁcation, was used to obtain identiﬁed particle spectra [5] and identi-
ﬁed particle ﬂuctuations [6]. Moreover, NA61 results, not only on spectra
but also on ﬂuctuations, are corrected for non-target interactions, detector
ineﬃciencies, and trigger bias (see Refs.[7, 8] for details).

Finally, for ﬂuctuation analysis numerous measures are proposed in the
literature. However, it is very important to use those which allow to elimi-
nate trivial sources of ﬂuctuations and keep only the ﬂuctuations of interest.
NA61 therefore uses new strongly intensive measures of ﬂuctuations which
are not only properly normalized (see below) but also allow to get rid of
trivial dependences on volume and volume ﬂuctuations.

2. Studying the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement

One of the main reasons to analyze spectra and yields in NA61 is to
study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement by looking whether the
kink, horn, and step [9] structures are present also in collisions of small and
intermediate mass nuclei. For Pb+Pb interactions NA49 showed a sharp
peak (horn) in the K+/π+ ratio interpreted as due to onset of deconﬁne-
ment [10]. Moreover, a plateau (step) in the inverse slope parameter (T )
of mT spectra was also observed as expected for constant temperature and
pressure in a mixed phase. The recent NA61 results [5] (see also this con-
ference slides for K+/π+ ratio in 4π acceptance) show that even in p+p
collisions the energy dependences of K+/π+ and T exhibit rapid changes
(however without a maximum for K+/π+) in the SPS energy range. In this
contribution kink plots are shown with new preliminary NA61 results from

Ar+Sc and Be+Be interactions.

The spectra of π− in Ar+Sc collisions were obtained using the so-called
h− analysis method assuming that the majority of negatively charged par-
ticles are π− mesons. The contribution (≈ 10%) of other particles (K−, p)
was subtracted using EPOS 1.99. Examples (see also Ref. [11]) of double
diﬀerential spectra of negatively charged pions in rapidity and transverse
momentum for the most central Ar+Sc interactions are presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. d2n/(dpT dy) spectra of π− mesons in 0-5% central Ar+Sc collisions.

Some examples of preliminary mT spectra of π− mesons in Ar+Sc colli-
sions are shown in Fig. 2 and compared to published NA61 p+p spectra [7],
preliminary NA61 Be+Be data, and NA49 Pb+Pb results [12, 13]. The p+p
mT spectra are exponential, but of a diﬀerent shape than seen for Pb+Pb,
Ar+Sc, and Be+Be interactions, which may originate from isospin eﬀects,
collective ﬂow, changing role of resonance production.

Fig. 2. Transverse mass spectra (two left) and rapidity spectra (two right) of π−
mesons in 0-5% Ar+Sc collisions. The mT spectra are compared to NA49 Pb+Pb
[12, 13] and NA61 p+p [7] and Be+Be results. Note: p+p and Pb+Pb collisions
were taken at 158A GeV/c beam momenta.

The corresponding pT -extrapolated and pT -integrated rapidity spectra
of π− mesons are shown in Fig. 2 (two right panels). One sees that the
spectra extend below mid-rapidity. A sum of two Gaussians [11] was used
to ﬁt the rapidity spectra and obtain 4π pion multiplicities which were then
used to draw the kink plots (Fig. 3). Figure 3 shows that the π multiplicity,
normalized to the number of wounded nucleons (W ), increases faster with
beam energy at the SPS energies in central Pb+Pb than in p+p collisions
(kink). The two dependences cross at about 40A GeV/c (
sN N = 8.77 GeV,
F = 2.47 GeV1/2). For high SPS energies Ar+Sc follows the Pb+Pb trend

and for low SPS energies Ar+Sc follows the p+p tendency. The situation is
opposite for Be+Be collisions. One should note that the results suﬀer from
model dependence of estimating W (see Ref. [14] for details).

3. Interaction cross-section of 7Be on 9Be

Preliminary NA61 results on the
interaction cross-section of 7Be on
9Be are presented in Fig. 4. The val-
ues of the inelastic cross-section (ini-
tial beam particle was broken up) and
the production cross section (at least
one new particle in the ﬁnal state) are
shown as a function of beam momen-
tum. Values measured by NA61 are
in good agreement with earlier mea-
surement at lower momentum [15], as
well as with predictions of the Glauber-based Glissando model [16]. The
NA61 measurements together with ∼1A GeV/c Bevalac data establish the
energy dependence of the inelastic cross section from 1A GeV to 150A GeV.

4. Search for the critical point

The strategy of looking for the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting
matter is based on a search for non-monotonic behavior of CP signatures
such as ﬂuctuations of transverse momentum, multiplicity, intermittency,
etc. when the system freezes out close to the CP. NA61 uses the strongly
intensive ∆[PT , N ], Σ[PT , N ], and ΦpT measures to study transverse mo-
mentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations [8, 17]. In the Grand Canonical En-
semble they do not depend on volume and volume ﬂuctuations. Moreover,

∆[PT , N ] and Σ[PT , N ] have two reference values, namely they are equal
to zero in case of no ﬂuctuations and one in case of independent particle
production. The recent NA61 results [17] show no sign of any anomaly, that
can be attributed to a CP, neither in p+p nor centrality selected Be+Be
collisions. On the other hand a maximum for Si+Si and C+C was observed
by NA49 in transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations at 158A
GeV/c (see Refs. [18, 17] and references therein).

4.1. Transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations in A+A

Figure 5 shows preliminary NA61 results on transverse momentum and
multiplicity ﬂuctuations in p+p, Be+Be, and Ar+Sc collisions (note that
p+p and Be+Be results were already shown by NA61 [8, 17] but in a
slightly diﬀerent acceptance). These three systems show no prominent non-
monotonic behavior that can be attributed to a CP. The values of ∆[PT , N ]
smaller than 1 and Σ[PT , N ] higher than 1 may be due to Bose-Einstein
statistics and/or anti-correlation between event transverse momentum and
multiplicity [19]. The Σ[PT , N ] values for h− at 150/158A GeV/c are higher
in Ar+Sc than in Be+Be and p+p, but this increase is seen also at lower
energies so it is not necessarily connected with a CP.

Fig. 5. ∆[PT , N ] and Σ[PT , N ] in inelastic p+p (grey squares), 0-5% Be+Be (red
triangles), and 0-5% Ar+Sc (blue circles) collisions obtained by NA61 at forward-
rapidity, 0 < yπ < ybeam, and in pT < 1.5 GeV/c. Results for all charged hadrons
(h+ + h−) and negatively charged hadrons (h−). See Ref. [20] for more plots.

Figure 6 (left and middle) shows that NA49 Pb+Pb [18] and NA61
Ar+Sc results (in NA49 narrower acceptance [18]) are similar. For the
system size dependence of Σ[PT , N ] at 150/158A GeV/c (Fig. 6, right) the
NA49 [18] and NA61 points show consistent trends. ∆[PT , N ] (not shown) is
more centrality width sensitive [19] and points are scattered (see Ref. [20]).

4.2. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations in Ar+Sc collisions

During the conference new NA61 results on multiplicity ﬂuctuations
in Ar+Sc collisions were shown using the scaled variance of the multiplic-
ity distribution (ω[N ]) and a newly deﬁned strongly intensive Ω measure
(see conference slides and Ref. [21]). There is no signiﬁcant non-monotonic

behavior in the energy dependence of those two measures, however an in-
teresting eﬀect was observed. Namely, for negatively charged hadrons (the
cleanest sample) at 150/158A GeV/c the scaled variance of the multiplicity
distribution is much below 1 for 0-0.2% Ar+Sc and 0-1% Pb+Pb and above
1 for p+p. This clearly shows the violation of the Wounded Nucleon Model
in this ﬂuctuation analysis. Moreover, it is also forbidden in the Ideal Boltz-
mann Grand Canonical Ensemble (see conference slides or Ref. [8] for more
detailed discussion). Within statistical models ω[N ] (cid:29) 1, as seen in p+p,
can be understood as a result of volume and/or energy ﬂuctuations [22].

4.3. Higher order moments of net-charge distribution in p+p collisions

Higher order moments of multiplicity distributions (skewness S, kurto-
sis κ) measure the non-Gaussian nature of ﬂuctuations and are more sensi-
tive (than the variance σ2) to ﬂuctuations at a CP [23, 24]. Moreover, they
can be used to test (statistical and dynamical) models (ﬁrst moments do not
allow to distinguish between diﬀerent types of models; already for second
moments ﬂuctuations are diﬀerent in string and statistical models). Finally,
higher moments of conserved quantum numbers (i = B, Q, S) allow for di-
rect comparison to theory via susceptibilities (Sσ ≈ χ3
i ).
The scaled variance (ω) and products of higher order moments of net-
charge distributions, measured in inelastic p+p interactions, are shown in
Fig. 7 (see conf. slides and Ref. [25] for the same quantities for h− only).
There is no non-monotonic behavior suggesting a CP. Results do not agree
with independent particle production (Skellam) but EPOS 1.99 describes
the data quite well. Be+Be and Ar+Sc data will be analyzed soon.
