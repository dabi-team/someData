Abstract. We investigate the possibility of measuring the primordial gravitational wave
(GW) signal across 21 decades in frequencies, using the cosmic microwave background (CMB),
pulsar timing arrays (PTA), and laser and atomic interferometers. For the CMB and PTA
experiments we consider the LiteBIRD mission and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), re-
spectively. For the interferometers we consider space mission proposals including the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the Big Bang Observer (BBO), the Deci-hertz Inter-
ferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO), the µAres experiment, the Decihertz
Observatory (DO), and the Atomic Experiment for Dark Matter and Gravity Exploration in
Space (AEDGE), as well as the ground-based Einstein Telescope (ET) proposal. We imple-
ment the mathematics needed to compute sensitivities for both CMB and interferometers,
and derive the response functions for the latter from the ﬁrst principles. We also evaluate the
eﬀect of the astrophysical foreground contamination in each experiment. We present binned
sensitivity curves and error bars on the energy density parameter, ΩGW h2, as a function of
frequency for two representative classes of models for the stochastic background of primordial
GW: the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuation in the metric from single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation, and
the source-induced tensor perturbation from the spectator axion-SU(2) inﬂation models. We
ﬁnd excellent prospects for joint measurements of the GW spectrum by CMB and space-borne
interferometers mission proposals.

The cosmic inﬂation paradigm [1–5] predicts the primordial Stochastic Background of Grav-
itational Waves (hereafter SGWB) [6, 7]. In the standard picture the scalar and tensor per-
turbations are generated by the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuations during inﬂation [7–12]. The
scalar modes are the seeds for the large-scale structure of the Universe and have been subject
to meticulous measurements (see e.g.
[13]), while the primordial tensor modes still remain
undetected. The importance of their detection cannot be overstated, since the primordial
SGWB would contain an unparalleled information on the very early Universe physics.
If
the single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂationary scenario is conﬁrmed, a detection of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio r, i.e., the ratio of the tensor and scalar power spectra, can be used to directly infer the
energy scale of inﬂation, allowing us to probe the ultra-high energy scales not accessible by
terrestrial particle colliders [14].

There are (at least) three ways to search for the SGWB at widely separated frequencies:
16 Hz, pulsar timing arrays at
7 Hz (see [15–17] for

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at f ≈ 10−
f ≈ 10−
reviews).

7 Hz, and laser and atomic interferometers at f (cid:38) 10−

For CMB, the primordial SGWB would imprint its signature in the B-mode polarization
[18, 19], which is currently the most promising channel for a near-future detection. Numerous
ground-based experiments are currently scanning the microwave sky in search of the primor-
dial B-mode, among them the Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization 2
(BICEP2)/Keck Array [20], POLARBEAR/Simons Array [21, 22], the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) [23], the South Pole Telescope (SPT) [24], and the Cosmology Large Angu-
lar Scale Surveyor (CLASS) [25]. Furthermore, the next decade will see a great increase in
the eﬀorts for detection with a new generation of experiments including the Simons Observa-
tory (SO) [26], the South Pole Observatory (SPO) and the Stage-IV network of ground-based
observatories (CMB-S4) [27–29]. As for space-borne experiments, the Japan Aerospace Ex-
ploration Agency has selected the LiteBIRD [30] as the second Strategic Large-class mission.
For pulsar timing arrays (hereafter PTA), the current generation experiments such as the
Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) [31, 32], the European PTA
[33] and the Parkes PTA [34] are placing limits on the SGWB. In future the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA) [35] will add to this international network of PTA.

For interferometers, the current generation of ground-based laser interferometers (LIGO
[36], VIRGO [37], KAGRA [38]) will be succeeded by the Cosmic Explorer (CE) [39] and
Einstein Telescope (ET) [40], operating between a few Hertz and a few kilo-Hertz. The
space-borne Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [41, 42] will be probing in the milli-
Hertz band. In addition there are a host of proposals for future space missions including the
µAres [43] in the micro-Hertz band; the Advanced Millihertz Gravitational-wave Observatory
(AMIGO) [44] in the milli-Hertz band; the Big Bang Observer (BBO) [45, 46], the Deci-hertz
Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) [47, 48], the Decihertz Observa-
tory (DO) [49], and the Atomic Experiment for Dark Matter and Gravity Exploration in
Space (AEDGE) [50] in the deci-Hertz bands.

Combining these experiments, we can measure the SGWB spectrum across 21 decades
in frequency. If we include indirect probes using the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and
the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, the range extends to 29 decades [34, 51]. This
combination enables a detailed characterization of the SGWB that goes beyond the simple
detection of r, which will be of utmost importance to determine if the detected primordial
SGWB was sourced by the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuations in the metric tensor, as in the
single-ﬁeld slow-roll scenario, or from alternative scenarios that can also produce the SGWB.
In this context, the possibility of SGWB production from gauge ﬁelds, both Abelian [52–60]
and non-Abelian [61–73], has been investigated in the literature.

These sourced gravitational waves come with distinct observational signatures: they can
be non-scale-invariant, partially chiral (circularly polarized), and strongly non-Gaussian. In
this paper, we focus on the ﬁrst signature, i.e., the spectrum of the SGWB, which can be
blue, red, or with a bump. See the above list of references for the other two signatures.1
Speciﬁcally, we seek to gather in one resource the expectations on the SGWB from the most
promising future experiments, covering the whole frequency range of the GW spectrum, and

1The high-frequency GW produced by the gauge ﬁeld during (p)reheating after inﬂation contributes to
the eﬀective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, which provides further constraints on the axion-U(1)
models [51, 74, 75].

study how they distinguish between the single-ﬁeld slow-roll prediction and the SU(2) gauge
ﬁeld predictions. We build on the work of Ref. [76] whose focus was on detection of chirality
of the SGWB from the SU(2) gauge ﬁeld (also see Ref. [77] for prospects to detect chirality
of the SGWB by LISA and ET).

To this end, we try to use coherent assumptions for each experiment and, whenever
possible, to derive the relevant quantities from the ﬁrst principles using the latest available
information in the literature. We provide therefore a quick reference for both communities of
cosmologists and GW astronomers for the sensitivities of future experiments capable of detect-
ing a SGWB, summarizing the mathematical tools needed to compute such sensitivities for
both the CMB and the interferometers. Finally, we show our results in a coherent manner by
plotting error bars representing the uncertainty on the binned tensor power spectrum for each
experiment2. For example, we derive forecasts for the precision on the tensor-to-scalar ratio
r and the tensor spectral index nT , for the combination of CMB B-modes experiments and
laser interferometers (LiteBIRD+LISA and LiteBIRD+BBO), using a Monte Carlo Markov
Chain exploration of the full cosmological parameters space.

We diﬀerentiate our work from the previous literature in three ways. First, we pro-
vide frequency-integrated error bars from the binned sensitivity curves for all the detectors.
Second, we include astrophysical foregrounds for all experiments. Finally, we use the lat-
est and realistic CMB sensitivity curves for the LiteBIRD mission, including state-of-the-art
simulations for the CMB foregrounds.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the two theoretical tensor
power spectrum models for which we will provide forecasts in the subsequent sections: the
single-ﬁeld slow-roll model and the spectator axion-SU(2) model. In Section 3 we discuss the
experimental setup for the CMB B-mode experiment LiteBIRD, including the instrumental
noise, the lensing contribution and the astrophysical foregrounds contamination. In Section
4 we construct the instrumental sensitivity curves for the interferometers and illustrate the
eﬀect of the astrophysical foregrounds on each experiment as well as on the PTA. Section 5
is dedicated to the discussion of our results concerning forecasts on the sensitivity of all the
experiments for the spectator axion-SU(2) and single-ﬁeld slow-roll models. We also present
the updated forecasts on the tensor spectral index nT exploiting the combination of CMB
experiments and laser interferometers. We conclude in Section 6 with future perspectives.

2 Theoretical Models for the Primordial Tensor Power Spectrum

In this Section we review the theoretical models of the primordial tensor power spectrum
for which we will provide forecasts in the rest of the paper. We consider two possibilities in
this respect: one is the nearly scale-invariant tensor power spectrum predicted in the context
of the single ﬁeld-slow roll inﬂation, while the other is the one produced by the spectator
axion-SU(2) model [68].

2.1 Single-Field Slow-Roll Model

In the single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂationary scenario [3–5], cosmological scalar [8–11] and tensor [7,
12] perturbations are produced by the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuations. The power spectrum for

the scalar perturbations is parametrized by a power-law P vac
is the amplitude of the scalar perturbations, nS the scalar spectral index, k the wavenumber

it is produced by the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuations. The same applies to the tensor power
spectrum

k0 (cid:19)
where AT is the amplitude of the tensor perturbations, nT the tensor spectral index and
αT = dnT /d ln k its running. We then deﬁne the tensor-to-scalar ratio r as r = AT /AS.
We also enforce the inﬂationary consistency relation in single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation [14],
connecting the spectral index and the amplitude of the tensor spectrum as nT = −r/8, while
its running satisﬁes the relation αT = (r/8) [(nS − 1) + r/8].

Currently no detection of r exists and there are only upper limits available. The best
limits come from CMB experiments, r < 0.06 at 95% CL, from the combination of the B-mode
polarization data of the BICEP2/Keck [78] and Planck 2018 data [13].

2.2 Spectator Axion-SU(2) Model

Gauge ﬁelds are ubiquitous in physics and can aﬀect the predictions of inﬂation (see [61] for a
review). In this paper we consider the SGWB produced in the spectator axion-SU(2) model
[68] based on the “chromo-natural” inﬂation model [79]. This model has the Lagrangian

where Linf laton represents a generic inﬂaton sector generating the quasi-de Sitter expanding
background and the curvature perturbations in agreement with the current CMB observa-
tions, χ is a pseudo-scalar axion ﬁeld with a cosine-type potential, µ and f are dimensionful
parameters and λ is a dimensionless coupling constant for the axion and gauge ﬁelds. The
ﬁeld strength tensor of the SU(2) gauge ﬁeld is given by F a
µAc
ν
with g being the gauge ﬁeld self-coupling constant, and ˜F aµν is its dual. We ignore the eﬀect
of the gravitational Chern-Simons term R ˜R because its eﬀect on the SGWB is sub-dominant
compared to the F ˜F term [80].

During inﬂation the SU(2) gauge ﬁeld establishes a homogeneous and isotropic vacuum
expectation value, ¯Ab
[65, 66], which is an attractor solution [81–83]. The
perturbation around this value contains scalar, vector, and tensor modes [65, 66], and the
tensor mode linearly mixes with gravitons to produce the SGWB. In particular, the gauge
ﬁeld produces a chiral SGBW with either left- or right-handed circular polarization, depending
on which circular polarization mode experiences a transient growth near horizon crossing [61–
64].

Assuming that only left-handed polarized GWs are produced, we can write the sourced

contribution to the tensor spectrum as [76]

and we will refer to them as AX1, AX2 and AX3 models, respectively. For all cases we will
assume the vacuum contribution to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of rvac = 10−
5 [76], although
this choice might be subject to backreaction of particle production of the gauge ﬁeld [86, 87].
To avoid this we can simply assume a larger value for rvac, which would add the scale-invariant
component to all the ﬁgures we show in this paper.

We chose the parameters given in Eq. 2.7 to provide representative examples for our
analysis. The ﬁrst set of parameters represents a tensor spectrum model that is simultaneously
detectable by both CMB and laser interferometers, while still satisfying the upper bound
provided by the BICEP2/Keck/Planck analysis (see the end of Section 2.1). The second set
produces instead a spectrum that is just outside the reach of LiteBIRD and at the same time
comfortably detectable by the advanced interferometers µAres, DECIGO and BBO, thanks
1. The third parameter set produces a
to the large bump feature produced at kp = 1011Mpc−
spectrum that peaks in the PTA experiments frequency range while still being compatible with
the BICEP2/Keck/Planck upper limit in the CMB range. Due to the relationship between σ
and kp, which tends to ﬂatten out the spectrum, we could get an SGWB detectable by SKA
only in the case without foreground contamination (Section 5).

3We do not include the non-linear scalar curvature perturbation induced by the gauge ﬁeld. This can be
very large in the original chromo-natural model in which the axion plays the role of inﬂaton [82, 85]. This
contribution in the spectator axion-SU(2) model is smaller [72], but may still aﬀect the allowed parameter
space in which the sourced GW is comparable to or larger than the vacuum contribution [86]. There is also
a possibility of having a non-negligible contribution to the scalar sector for a very large σ parameter choice,
if the energy fraction of the axion grows after inﬂation and the axion decays faster than the inﬂaton [see 76,
and references therein].

cases considered in this paper, plus a standard r = 0.06 model representing the CMB upper
bound from the BICEP2/Keck/Planck combined analysis (black dashed curve).

In Figure 1 we show the tensor power spectra PT as a function of the wavenumber k for
the ﬁve cases considered in this paper. We have checked that all models are consistent with
the current CMB shortwave and second-order back-reaction [88], indirect upper bounds [89],
PTA limits [32] and ground-based interferometers LIGO/Virgo [90] limits.

2.3 Gravitational Wave Energy Density

A quantity commonly used in the literature to show the sensitivities of GW observatories is
the fractional energy density in GWs at the present (conformal) time τ0 [91]4

In the equation above ρc is the critical energy density of the Universe and ρGW the energy
ab(cid:105)/(32πa2G), where the tensor hab represents the GW
density of GWs, given by ρGW = (cid:104)h(cid:48)abh(cid:48)
metric perturbation and the (cid:48) indicates the conformal time derivative. The second equality in
Eq. 2.8 can be obtained from the deﬁnition of the tensor power spectrum and by expressing the
time evolution of the primordial GW amplitude – solution of the linearized Einstein equation
– in terms of the GW transfer function T (k, τ ) [see 92, and references therein]. In the rest of
this paper, we will use approximate analytical expressions for ΩGW , derived in [92], and valid

3 CMB B-mode Experiments

CMB experiments are at the forefront of the search for a primordial SGWB. As we discussed
in Section 2.1, the current best observational bounds on the SGWB come from the CMB.
Furthermore, as it will be shown in Section 5, they represent our best opportunity to detect
a SGWB if the correct model for its production is the single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation with
r (cid:46) 0.001.

The current generation of operating CMB experiments includes BICEP2/Keck, POLAR-
BEAR, ACT, SPT and CLASS while the next generation of experiments, planned for this

– 7 –

decade, will comprise the Simons Array, SO, SPO and CMB-S4 on the ground-based side,
and the LiteBIRD mission observing from space. In this paper, we will focus on making fore-
casts for the LiteBIRD, which is expected to be – together with CMB-S4 – the most sensitive
among the planned missions, capable of detecting a tensor-to-scalar ratio r (cid:46) 0.001.

The signature of the primordial SGWB in the B-mode polarization has two main con-
tributions: one at very large scales (around k ∼ 6 × 10−
1) where the CMB photons
are re-scattered by the free electrons made available by cosmic reionization [95], producing
the so-called reionization bump, and the other at intermediate scales (k ∼ 6 × 10−
1)
corresponding to the recombination bump [96]. This primordial signal, however, is fainter
than the contaminating signals of the secondary origin: smaller scales are dominated by the
gravitational lensing due to the cosmological large-scale structure, which converts the E-mode
polarization of the CMB into a secondary B-mode [97], while larger scales are contaminated
by the presence of the diﬀuse Galactic foregrounds.

In this Section we ﬁrst review the formalism of CMB power spectra (Section 3.1). We
then describe the relevant noise sources for CMB experiments, including the instrumental, the
lensing and the astrophysical foreground contributions (Section 3.2). Finally, we review the
Fisher matrix approach for computing the binned uncertainties on the tensor power spectrum
for a CMB experiment (Section 3.3).

3.1 CMB Angular Power Spectra

CMB experiments do not observe directly the scalar or tensor power spectra described in
Sections 2, but rather their eﬀects on the CMB temperature and polarization angular power
spectra CXX (cid:48)
, where the
indices X, X (cid:48) = {T, E, B} label the total intensity (T), gradient (E) and curl (B) modes
are the coeﬃcients of the spherical harmonic
of the CMB polarization [18, 19] and the aX
(cid:96)m
expansion of the total intensity and polarization.

Assuming that vector modes get diluted by the expansion of the Universe, each an-
gular power spectrum will have contributions only from scalar and tensor modes, so that

the cosmological parameters, for which we assume the Planck 2018 values [13], and can be
computed from a Boltzmann solver such as CAMB [98] or CLASS [99].

the SGWB rather than by its circular polarization, and consider only the BB spectrum in
our analysis.

3.2 Noise and Foregrounds for CMB Experiments

In this paper we will consider the LiteBIRD satellite and its constraining power on the SGWB.
For our purpose we can characterize this instrument using the following parameters: the
polarization sensitivity (in µK-arcmin units) at each frequency channel, the Full Width at
Half Maximum (FWHM) for the instrument beams, the observed sky fraction fsky and the
multipole range of the measurement. For LiteBIRD we adopt a multipole range from (cid:96)min = 2
to (cid:96)max = 200. We report all the other speciﬁcations in Table 1.

As we already mentioned above, there are three relevant noise sources which contribute

to the total observed CMB B-mode spectrum CBB

(cid:96)

The lensing represents a contaminant of the unknown amplitude when searching for a
primordial signal and aﬀects especially the smaller angular scales of the CMB B-modes. We
compute CBB, lens
using the CAMB code. Note that for LiteBIRD we conservatively do not
consider any cleaning from the lensing contamination, i.e., a procedure called “delensing”
[104–107], but we stress that high resolution ground-based experiments such as CMB-S4 can
be exploited to delens LiteBIRD data to enhance its capability in reconstructing the SGWB.
On the other hand, the dominant source of noise on large scale B-mode polarization is the
diﬀuse Galactic foregrounds [see, e.g., 108, and references therein]. In particular, in this paper
we will consider the two main sources of foregrounds for B-mode experiments: the thermal
emission of dust grains and the synchrotron radiation emitted by cosmic-ray electrons spiraling
in the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld [see 109, and references therein]. We generate simulated sky
maps of the polarized Galactic foreground emission using the “d1s1” sky model in the Python
Sky Model (PySM) code [110], and degrade them to a HEALPIX [111] resolution Nside = 128.
We add to the simulated maps an instrumental white noise realization generated by the model
in Eq. 3.4. We perform component separation for three possible spectral energy distributions
(SEDs): the CMB SED, for which we assume no free parameters; the thermal dust SED, for
which we take the one-component modiﬁed black-body

Adust(ν) =

ν
νd (cid:19)
with the spectral index βd and the temperature Td as free parameters and the reference
frequency νd ﬁxed to 353 GHz ; and the synchrotron SED, for which we assume the curved

We compute the contributions of residual foregrounds CBB, f gs

and post component sep-
aration noise CBB, noise
to the observed spectrum using the parametric maximum likelihood
approach [103, 112–114] implemented in the publicly available ForeGroundBuster (FGBuster)
code5. This code allows for several diﬀerent choices of cleaning techniques, among which we
choose the Multi-Resolution procedure, an evolution of the Multi-patch technique presented in
[115]. While in the Multi-Patch approach we ﬁt all the spectral parameters over independent
sky patches equal to HEALPIX pixels with the same resolution parameter Nside, in the Multi-
resolution approach, each of the free spectral parameters is ﬁtted on a diﬀerent HEALPIX grid
with diﬀerent resolution. The patches resolution for each parameter are gathered in the Multi-
resolution vector Nsides, for which we adopt the choice Nsides = [βd, Td, βs, Cs] = [64, 8, 8, 0],
obtained by prioritizing the characterization of dust SED over synchrotron SED and by re-
quiring that systematic residuals are much smaller than the statistical ones (J. Errard 2019,
private communication). This selection of parameters provides appropriate residuals for the
current foreground modeling in LiteBIRD.

We average the resulting residual foregrounds plus post-component separation noise
spectra over 100 noise realizations, obtaining the ﬁnal spectrum in Figure 2 (red curve). This
In the angular domain, the diﬀuse Galactic
spectrum is roughly composed by two parts.
foregrounds are usually characterized by a decaying power law with the angular multipole.

spectrum CBB, lens
(black solid line) and the primordial B-mode signals for r = 0.01 (dashed
grey) and r = 0.001 (solid grey).

(cid:96)

Therefore, at high (cid:96), the foreground contamination is less relevant, and the component sep-
aration noise is the co-addition of sensitivity in multi-frequency channels corresponding to
the CMB solution. On the other hand, at low and intermediate multipoles, the structure is
dominated by the component separation residuals from the large scale pattern of foregrounds.

3.3 Fisher Matrix for the Tensor Power Spectrum

To compute the binned uncertainties on the tensor power spectrum for LiteBIRD, we use a
Fisher matrix approach similar to the one described in Refs. [96, 116]. We report here the
main ingredients of the method. The tensor power spectrum PT can be discretized as

PT (k) = AS

piWi(ln k) ,

(3.7)

(cid:88)i
where Wi is the discretization window function, which we choose to be equal to 1 inside the
i-th of the N power spectrum bins and 0 outside

and ∆ ln k = (ln ki+1 − ln ki) is the width of the i-th bin. The discretization process allows
with respect to the power spectrum parameters pi in a
to write the derivative of the CXX (cid:48)

Interferometers and PTA

The landscape of the current and future interferometers and PTA experiments is vast, char-
acterized by their complementarity in probing the GW spectrum across a wide range of
7 and ∼ 10 Hz is expected to be observed
frequencies. The frequency window between ∼ 10−
from space through a host of funded and proposed laser interferometers, ranging from µAres
[43] in the micro-Hertz band, to LISA [42] and AMIGO [44] in the milli-Hertz band, to BBO
[45, 46], DECIGO [47] and DO [49] in the deci-Hertz bands. In this work we also include the
recently proposed space-based atom interferometer AEDGE [50], which will observe the deci-
Hertz band as well. Going higher in the GW frequency (∼ 10 − 103 Hz), the next-generation
ground-based detectors (CE [39] and ET [40]), also exploiting laser interferometry, will com-
plement the previous observations in the high-frequency part of the GW spectrum.

We summarize in Table 2 the main instrumental characteristics and capabilities of GW
observatories treated in this paper, including the experiment type, the arm lenght (L) for
traditional interferometers, the total observation length (Tobs), the observational eﬃciency
(cid:15) to compute the actual observation time Tef f = (cid:15)Tobs, the frequency range at which the
experiment is operating, and the minimum of the binned sensitivity curve with and without
foregrounds.

Going lower in the frequency, PTAs will probe GWs in the ∼ 10−

7 Hz region.
There are several planned and ongoing PTA experiments (NANOGrav [31, 32], EPTA [121],
PPTA [122, 123], IPTA [124]). In this paper we show the expected constraints for the most
ambitious experiment of this kind, i.e., the SKA [35].

9 − 10−

All of the experiments listed above will target several GW sources, both stochastic and
deterministic, but in the following we will be interested only in the stochastic ones, and in
particular in the possibility of detecting a SGWB of the primordial origin. Therefore, we
will consider other SGWB sources, such as unresolved Galactic and extra-Galactic compact
binaries for instance, as a foreground or confusion noise to our sought-after primordial signal.

In this Section, we ﬁrst describe the formalism required to compute the sensitivity curves
for interferometers (Section 4.1). We then describe in detail our choices concerning the astro-
physical foreground contamination (Section 4.2) and how it aﬀects the sensitivity curve for
each experiment. In Section 4.3 we describe how we calculate the sensitivity curve for the
SKA. To supplement these sections, in Appendix we describe the construction of the inter-
ferometers response functions (Appendix A) and the noise properties of each interferometer
(Appendix B).

4.1

Instrumental Sensitivity Curves

In this Section we derive the equation for the sensitivity curve of a GW laser interferometer
to an homogeneous and isotropic SGWB. Three of the experiments considered in this work
(µAres, DECIGO, BBO) are designed as two independent triangular interferometers, with
consequently uncorrelated instrumental noises. The target of these experiments is to measure
the cross-correlation of the outputs of the two independent detectors. Therefore, in the
following we will provide formulae for both the sensitivity of a single detector (suited for
LISA, DO, ET ) and for the cross-correlation of two independent detectors. Our discussion

– 13 –

follows Refs. [46, 125, 126], and we refer to those papers for a more complete and detailed
derivation. For a derivation of the sensitivity curve of a PTA experiment, which will not be
reproduced here, we refer the reader to Refs. [125, 127].

4.2 Astrophysical Foregrounds for interferometers and PTA

We proceed now to describe the main sources of astrophysical foregrounds considered in this
work: we ﬁrst provide approximate analytical ﬁtting formulas for each component (Subsection
4.2.1); then we introduce, in Subsection 4.2.2, a ﬁlter function capable of maximizing the SNR
expression including foregrounds (possibly mitigating them with external information) and
ﬁnally we describe our foreground cleaning strategy on a case-by-case basis (Subsection 4.2.3).

discussed in Section 4.2) for all the interferometers and PTA experiments considered in this
paper. We also plot for reference the strain curve for the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) experi-

4.2.1 Approximate analytical ﬁts for the foreground sources
The main sources of astrophysical foregrounds for laser and atomic interferometers are repre-
sented by the unresolved populations of Galactic and Extragalactic White Dwarfs (hereafter
GWD and EGWD, respectively), as well as unresolved stellar mass Black Hole, Neutron Star
and Black Hole - Neutron Star Binaries (hereafter BBH, BNS and BH-NS, respectively). At
PTA frequencies the dominant foreground is expected to be the one due to the coalescence
of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHB). This latter foreground could be of importance also
for the µAres interferometer, at frequencies below ∼ 10−

We now describe the model adopted for each of the foreground contributions men-
tioned above, starting with the GWD binaries confusion noise. Following Refs. [131, 132], we
parametrize it as

4.2.2 A ﬁlter for foreground mitigation
In this Subsection, we will describe a possible strategy for the mitigation of astrophysical
foreground, using in particular the ﬁlter Q(f ) introduced in Poletti D. 2020 (in prepara-
tion), which maximizes the SNR including foregrounds, taking into account the possibility of
mitigation by using external information provided by other experiments.

Speciﬁcally, we consider the possibility of a multi-band cleaning strategy for the BBH+BNS

foreground in the space interferometers bands: it has been shown in Refs. [136, 137] that it
is indeed possible to use the information on the BBH+BNS populations gathered by ground-
based experiments – such as Advanced LIGO/Virgo or the future ET and CE detectors –
to remove to a certain degree this foreground contamination from the band of space-borne
interferometers like LISA.

In the following, we will assume to know the foreground S BBH+BN S

up to a fractional

uncertainty on its amplitude σf g. In this case, the cross-correlation estimator [130]

where Q(f ) is a ﬁlter function and δT is a ﬁnite-time approximation to the Dirac delta

maximizes the SNR in Eq. 4.21, taking into account the presence of foregrounds.

Note that, if we know the spectral shape of the foreground but we do not have any
external constraint σf g on its amplitude, we can still apply Eqs. 4.21 and 4.25 in the limit
σf g → ∞ (and T > 0): in this case the ﬁlter has zero response to the foreground template and
this corresponds to subtracting the foregrounds by only exploiting its spectral dependence.
Moreover, the SNR 4.21 and the ﬁlter 4.25 can obviously be applied to whatever foreground
with known power-law spectral shape, not only to the BBH+BNS foreground, and can be
extended also to multiple foreground components (Poletti D. 2020 in preparation). Finally, we
note that an expression for the binned sensitivity curve in terms of the minimum detectable
GW energy density can be easily obtained in an analogous way to Eq. 4.12 also in the case
with foregrounds.

4.2.3 Foreground cleaning strategy for interferometers
We discuss now, on a case-by-case basis, our treatment of the contamination of the astrophys-
ical foregrounds when attempting a detection of the primordial SGWB for each interferometer
considered in this work, starting with LISA.

LISA — As evident from the left panel of Figure 4, the WD binaries constitute one of the
most relevant confusion noise source in the LISA band, at frequencies f (cid:46) 5 mHz. However,
it has been shown in [138] that this foreground can be subtracted almost completely by
exploiting its anisotropy and its time-modulation due to the motion of LISA’s constellation

– 18 –

Figure 4: Characteristic strain noise curve (dashed curves) for LISA (left panel) and DO
(right panel). The foregrounds due to unresolved GWD (dot-dashed blue), EGWD (dot-
dashed red) and BBH+BNS populations (dot-dashed green) are also shown.

[136]. In this work, therefore, we will optimistically assume that the GWD foreground can
be perfectly subtracted.

The EGWD foreground could also be relevant in the LISA band, in particular between
f ∼ 5 mHz and ∼ 0.2 Hz, beyond which it starts to deviate from a power-law behavior.
Diﬀerently from the GWD one, this foreground is expected to be almost isotropic, with
a hint of anisotropy due to the stronger signal by nearby galaxies which may be used to
favor the subtraction. Moreover, its unique spectral shape could also help in separating
and subtracting this contaminant from the primordial signal [138]. As shown in [137], the
impact of this foreground on the SNR for LISA is secondary with respect to the BBH+BNS
foreground. Therefore, we will neglect the EGWD foreground in our approximate treatment.
The main foreground in the LISA band is represented by the unresolved BBH+BNS
populations. Diﬀerently from the GWD and EGWD foreground – which cannot be subtracted
using ground-based experiments, since WD binaries never enter their bands – we exploit a
multi-band cleaning technique for the BBH+BNS foreground. We adopt a value σf g ∼ 0.1
for the fractional uncertainty on the foreground amplitude, justiﬁed by the analysis of [136],
involving multi-band cleaning with Advanced LIGO and Virgo. A value σf g ∼ 1.3 × 10−
2
could also be reached using a network of three CE detectors located in Australia, China and
3 could be reached using external information
US [137]. Furthermore, the level σf g ∼ 10−
provided by ET (M. Pieroni, A. Ricciardone and E. Barausse in preparation).

DO Optimal/Conservative and AEDGE — The DO interferometer, both in its Op-
timal and Conservative incarnations, suﬀers mainly from the presence of the BBH+BNS
foreground (right panel of Figure 4). The contribution from GWD is almost irrelevant in
both designs, as it aﬀects only the very low-frequency part of both sensitivity curves. The
same holds for the AEDGE experiment (left panel of Figure 5), since it has similar sensitivity
and frequency range to DO Optimal (Figure 3). For DO (Optimal and Conservative) and
AEDGE, we make the same foreground cleaning assumption described above for LISA.

DECIGO and BBO — As for DECIGO and BBO, the BBH+BNS foreground constitutes
the main contaminant in their bands (Figure 6). BBH and BNS can be individually resolved
and subtracted by these two ultra-sensitive interferometers, leaving a residual foreground with
3 smaller than the original one in the DECIGO case [133, 139],
amplitude a factor ∼ 5 × 10−

GWD binaries (dot-dashed blue) for µAres.

while BBO should be capable instead of resolving all compact binaries in its band, thanks to
its deeper sensitivity, which allows to fully subtract them [133, 140].

Despite the subtraction of resolved sources, the BBH+BNS foreground remains a strong
limiting factor for DECIGO: it has been suggested in the past that an improvement of a
factor ∼ 2 or ∼ 3 in sensitivity should be enough to fully resolve and subtract this foreground
In alternative to this sensitivity boost, we also try to consider the possibility of a
[133].
multi-band cleaning for DECIGO using ET, corresponding to σf g ∼ 10−
3; however, in this
case the sensitivity does not improve signiﬁcantly with respect to the case in which we only
use the spectral dependence to subtract the foreground. We conclude that in order to fully
restore the SGWB detection power of DECIGO, we need at least a value σf g ∼ 10−
6, which
seems to be at the moment outside of the reach of external ground-based experiments.

3−10−

The EGWD confusion noise is expected to contribute mostly in DECIGO’s and BBO’s
1 Hz. As we discussed in LISA’s case, potentially this foreground
bands in the range 10−
could be subtracted in a very eﬃcient way using its unique spectral dependence, and moreover
its contribution is expected to drop very steeply beyond f ∼ 0.2 Hz. For these reasons, we
discuss results for DECIGO and BBO for both an optimistic case, neglecting this foreground,
and a pessimistic case without any subtraction, cutting oﬀ frequencies (cid:46) 0.2 Hz [139, 141].

µAres — The sensitivity curve of µAres appears to be strongly aﬀected by the Galactic
WD foreground in almost all the experiment bandwidth (right panel of Figure 5). Although
a treatment similar to LISA’s one [138] does not exist at the moment for µAres, we assume
that a subtraction strategy, exploiting the anisotropy and time-modulation of this foreground
can be applied, perfectly subtracting this contaminant. The EGWD foreground, on the other
hand, should be of secondary importance for µAres, and we neglect it in the following.

The BBH+BNS foreground is also very relevant in the µAres band, therefore we adopt
a multi-band cleaning approach as in LISA’s case: for the AX1 model, a value σf g ∼ 0.1 is
enough to obtain multiple detections over µAres band, while for the other SGWB models we
show results for σf g ∼ 10−
3 (in conjunction with third-generation detector ET). However,
even the latter value for σf g strongly limits the prospects for detection for an inﬂationary
SGWB (see Figure 20): we conclude that to restore the full “sensitivity bucket” of µAres,

In addition to the three components we described above, the coalescence of MBHB could
produce an unresolved foreground between ∼ 10−
5 Hz (dot-dashed purple curve).
We approximate this foreground as a power-law in the µAres band (see Section 4.2.1) and we
subtract it by means of its spectral shape. Therefore, in the µAres case we will use a version
of the ﬁlter 4.25 extended to multiple foregrounds, adopting for the BBH+BNS component
a multi-band approach with ﬁnite σf g and the limit σf g → ∞ for the MBHB one.

7 and ∼ 10−

ET — Concerning the ground-based ET, the dominant source of confusion noise in this
frequency band is represented by BBH and BNS (left panel of Figure 7). The BBH contri-
bution can be remarkably reduced by individually resolving sources, leaving a residual with
amplitude a factor ∼ 200 smaller than the initial foreground, while the BNS and BH-NS
contributions are more strenuous and can be reduced only by a factor ∼ 2 and ∼ 10, respec-
tively [142]. The total BBH+BNS foreground can be reduced through individual subtraction
by an overall factor of ∼ 3 [142], thus still constituting an important limiting factor when
attempting a detection of the primordial SGWB. We adopt in this case the σf g → ∞ limit
in our ﬁlter for ET, corresponding to subtraction using only the spectral dependence of this
foreground.

4.3 SKA

For SKA we optimistically include only the white noise component in the noise budget;
however, we note that the so-called “red noise” component due to pulsar timing noise [127]
could be present in the data, raising considerably the noise level in the lower frequency part
of the PTA sensitivity curves. We use the the codes hasasia7 [127] and gwent8 to compute
the sensitivity to the SGWB, choosing for the pulsars an rms timing residual of σt = 50 ns, an
observing time T = 10 yr, a number of pulsars Np = 200 and an average observation cadence
of 1 per week [120].

As for the foreground, Figure 7 shows that the most sensitive part of the SKA bandwidth
will be limited by the presence of the MBHB astrophysical foreground. We approximate this

SNR and ﬁlter expressions in Eqs. 4.21 and 4.25, respectively.

5 Results

In this Section we present the forecasts for CMB, PTA, and interferometers, described re-
spectively in Sections 3 and 4. We will ﬁrst show the binned sensitivity curves obtained for
LiteBIRD, SKA, and all the direct detection experiments (Section 5.1). Then, in Section 5.2
we will proceed to show the error bars for each experiment and each of the ﬁve example tensor
power spectrum models described in Section 2.

5.1 Binned ΩGW Sensitivity Curves
We calculate the binned sensitivity curves to the gravitational wave energy density ΩGW using
Eq. 3.12 for the LiteBIRD CMB experiment, Eq. 4.12 for all the interferometers and PTA ex-
periments (and its equivalent when taking the foregrounds into account, as described Section
4.2). We plot them in Figure 8, choosing ∆ ln k = 1.2 as the power spectrum discretization
scale. The solid and dashed lines show the sensitivities obtained with and without the fore-
grounds, respectively. The sensitivity of a CMB experiment to ΩGW , as computed in Section
3.3, depends on the ﬁducial tensor power spectrum used to compute the C(cid:96) in the Fisher
matrix given in Eq. 3.10; thus, the sensitivity curve of LiteBIRD (in red) is computed for
r = 0 – that is without including cosmic variance – for consistency with the interferometers.
Note also that the LiteBIRD sensitivity always includes the foregrounds.

3 Hz and DECIGO and BBO at f ∼ 10−

We ﬁnd that the best sensitivity of LiteBIRD (including foregrounds) at frequencies
17 Hz is similar to those of the most advanced among the interferometers, namely
f ∼ 10−
µAres at f ∼ 10−
1 Hz. However, when plotting error
bars on the model predictions in the next sub-Section, we ﬁnd that the shape of the GW
spectrum is very diﬀerent for CMB and interferometer frequencies. It has a rising spectrum
towards the CMB frequency after the transition between the matter and radiation dominated
eras, while for the single-ﬁeld slow-roll model it rapidly ﬂattens out at higher frequencies,
making a detection challenging for interferometers. The situation changes dramatically for

some parameter choices of the axion-SU(2) model, which can produce a strongly blue-tilted
signal easily detectable at interferometer frequencies [76].

Figure 8 also highlights the fact that the frequency window between ∼ 10−

9 Hz
is devoid of any experiment. The constraints on the SGWB intensity in this range come
only from indirect limits, such as the BBN, second-order back-reaction and CMB shortwave
calculations [88].

16 − 10−

Concerning the eﬀect of the foregrounds, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant impacts in the frequency
range 10−
3 − 102 Hz, due to unresolved BBH and BNS, mainly limiting the sensitivity of
µAres, DO, AEDGE, DECIGO and ET. In particular, the DO Optimal and Conservative
(grey and green curves in Figure 8 respectively) and AEDGE (in light red) experiments seem
to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by this component for a fractional uncertainty σf g ∼ 0.1 on the
amplitude of the BBH+BNS foreground [136]. However, this does not prevent detection
of the AX1 model at high signiﬁcance in multiple bins for these three experiments, as we
will see in the next Section. Moreover, it will possible to further decrease the σf g for these
2 level using external information from third generation ground-
experiments to the ∼ 1.3×10−
based experiments such as CE [137] (Section 4.2), or even to the ∼ 10−
3 level using ET (M.
Pieroni, A. Ricciardone e E. Barausse in preparation). On the other hand, DECIGO (in
orange) and µAres (in cyan) are appreciably limited by the BBH+BNS foreground even for
values σf g ∼ 10−
3. Moreover, µAres is also aﬀected – especially at lower frequencies – by the
presence of the MBHB foreground, which limits the sensitivity of SKA (light purple curve)
as well.

Next, we calculate the 1σ error bars on ΩGW for ﬁve models of the primordial tensor spectrum.
Of these, three are the AX1, AX2 and AX3 models deﬁned in Section 2.2 (see Eq. 2.7), while
two are single-ﬁeld slow-roll ones with r = 0.01 and r = 0.001 with tensor tilt and running
satisfying the inﬂationary consistency relation. In this Section we discuss the results for the
former models, while in the next Section 5.3 we discuss the latter. Note that we include
cosmic variance in the error bars for all experiments [see 94, 143, for cosmic variance in
interferometers cross-correlation]. We also report here a caveat on inferring the global SNR
from the binned error bars, considering two possible regimes for the ﬁlter 4.25:
if ﬁlter is
dominated by the external information (σ−

among the bins and therefore simply coadding the SNR of all bins would be too optimistic;
in the regime σ−
f g instead, the simple coaddition of each bin’s SNR leads to

pessimistic estimates of the global SNR, as the information lost due to the binning increases
with the number of components removed, which is proportional to the number of bins. We
checked that both these eﬀects are irrelevant for our results in the selection of cases presented
in this work.

In Figure 9, we show the results for LiteBIRD, SKA, LISA and ET. The light and dark
shaded areas show the error bars for the AX1 model with and without the astrophysical
foregrounds included in our calculation. We always take the foregrounds into account for the
LiteBIRD CMB satellite, as explained in Section 3.2.

For what concerns the AX1 model, we tuned its parameter set to have simultaneous
detections in both the CMB and the interferometers ranges, while still being consistent with
the BICEP2/Keck/Planck upper bound at CMB scales (the dashed pink curve in Figure 9).
As can be seen from the plots, this model can be detected in the PTA and ground-based
range, only when neglecting the foreground contamination.

By observing closely the CMB part of the spectrum, the LiteBIRD error bars clearly
show two peaks of sensitivity corresponding to the reionization bump (second bin from the
left) and the recombination bump (fourth and ﬁfth bins from the left), as we anticipated in
Section 3. Both these bumps corresponds to detections of this model (green error bars in
Figure 9).

For the space-borne interferometer LISA, we adopt a multi-band cleaning of the BBH+BNS

foreground, exploiting external information from Advanced LIGO/Virgo, which provides
σf g ∼ 0.1, as we discussed in Section 4.2: this allows detection in two bins either with
or without foregrounds (blue error bars in Figure 9).

The ground-based ET shows detections only in the absence of foregrounds (purple error
bars in Figure 9. We tried to tune the axion-SU(2) parameter set to have detections also from
ground-based interferometers in the presence of the foreground, but were not successful due
to the attractor behaviour of the theory and the CMB upper bounds, as explained in Section
2.2.

Similarly, SKA shows two detections in the foreground-less case but none in the case
with foregrounds for this model. This conﬁrms PTA surveys as a useful instrument to charac-
terize exotic SGWB models with bump- or peak-like features in their frequency range [144],
highlighting however the fact that they could be limited in practice by the presence of the
MBHB astrophysical foreground.

In Figures 10–12, we show the expected error bars for the AX1 model for the other
interferometers. We show the error bars only for the experiments that can give a detection
(without the foregrounds contamination) in at least one bin. Therefore, we show DO Conser-

vative, DO optimal and AEDGE only for the AX1 model, which has the strongest signal in
the frequency range favorable to them. We do not show them for the other models because
they would not be able to have a detection in at least one bin. However, we make an exception
for DECIGO and BBO and do not show their error bars for the AX1 and AX3 models despite
excellent prospects for the detection, since these experiments are so sensitive that the error
bars would be invisible, similarly to what happens for the µAres experiment.

Figures 10 and 11 show that the error bars for the DO Conservative and Optimal designs
are similar for this particular model, with the less-sensitive Conservative setup having one
detection missing with respect to the Optimal case in the next to last bin. In both cases, the
foreground contamination appears to have a small impact. Figure 12 shows the error bars
for the AEDGE atomic interferometer: this detector shows a similar sensitivity to the DO
Optimal design, with the latter being slightly less sensitive while covering a wider frequency
range.

The error bars on the AX1 model for the µAres mission are shown in Figure 13. The
foreground contamination plays a minor role in this very high SNR case, and the µAres is
capable of detecting this model across an impressive range of frequencies ∼ 10−
2 Hz,
even for a value as high as σf g = 0.1 for the BBH+BNS multi-band foreground cleaning, as
provided by Advanced LIGO/Virgo.

Next, we show the error bars for the AX2 model. This set was speciﬁcally tuned to show
the capability of the axion-SU(2) to produce a signal out of the reach of LiteBIRD while being
detectable in the interferometer bands. For this case we use a larger bin size, ∆ ln k = 2.0.
In Figures 14, 15 and 16, we show the results for this model for µAres, DECIGO and BBO,

(see Section 4.2.3). For DECIGO, we show instead two diﬀerent options for the foreground
treatment: the very light shaded error bars represent the case in which we only use the
spectral dependence to subtract the foreground, while the light shaded error bars assume
instead multi-band cleaning with σf g ∼ 10−

case without foregrounds. In this case, we see that the addition of foregrounds for DECIGO
does not allow any detection, while we have a detection at high signiﬁcance in one bin in
the case without foregrounds contamination. BBO, on the other hand, should be able to
resolve and subtract all compact sources (see Section 4.2.3): because of this, the error bars
for BBO with and without foregrounds are the same, showing detections of the AX2 model
at high-signiﬁcance in three bins. We show in Figures 15 and 16 a grey vertical line indicates
the EGWD frequency cutoﬀ at ∼ 0.2 Hz, if we pessimistically assume no subtraction of this

the PTA frequency range with the AX3 model, producing a signal detectable by SKA and
LiteBIRD – while still complying with the BICEP2/Keck/Planck upper bound on CMB
scales – but outside the reach of LISA and ET (even without the foreground contamination,
see Figure 17) but we could not succeed in obtaining a signal detectable by SKA when
accounting for the MBHB foreground contamination. This is due to the attractor nature of

bump σ for a given peak scale kp (see Section 2.2). Although we do not show error bars for
other experiments, we checked that the AX3 model is also not detectable by DO, AEDGE
and DECIGO, while µAres and BBO can detect it at high signiﬁcance in three bins, even
when accounting for foregrounds.

5.3 Error bars on single-ﬁeld slow-roll models and combined constraints on nT
We consider now the two single-ﬁeld slow-roll models with r = 0.01 and 0.001, with both nT
and its running determined by the consistency relation. We choose a bin size of ∆ ln k = 2.0.
The model with the larger r = 0.01 is easily detected by LiteBIRD in multiple bins. On
interferometric scales, it can be detected in two bins – or in one bin if pessimistically assuming
no cleaning of the EGWD foreground – by BBO (Figure 19), while µAres can detect this model
only without foregrounds (Figure 20), and DECIGO, in its standard design, cannot detect
this model even without foregrounds (Figure 18).

To have a detection in at least one bin for the lower r = 0.001, we increase the binning
scale to ∆ ln k = 4.0. This model is detected by LiteBIRD on the CMB side, however not even
BBO, the most sensitive among the considered direct detection experiments, can detect it on
the side of interferometers (Figure 21). The SNR remains smaller than 1 even considering a
single bin enclosing the whole BBO band.

With the extremely high sensitivity of BBO at frequencies ∼ 16 orders of magnitude
larger than the CMB, ones creates a signiﬁcant lever-arm, providing interesting constraints
on the spectrum tilt nT . The path of multi-frequency measurements of the primordial tensor
spectrum has been explored in the past, in the context of forecasts [see for instance 145, for the
combination of Planck/CMBPol and DECIGO/BBO9], as well as of the analysis of available

adding SPTPol [149] or COrE and other indirect constraints [89] to the previous datasets.
Notably, Ref. [148] uses the original BICEP2 results, which have not been conﬁrmed due to
Galactic dust contamination, while the subsequent works [149] and [89] are based instead
on the combined BICEP/Planck analysis, with the latter work more focused on smaller r
values detectable by future CMB missions. Furthermore, Ref.[150] explored the possibility
of constraining early Universe physics – in particular its equation of state, cosmic phase
transitions and free-streaming neutrinos or other relativistic dark ﬂuids – focusing on the
constraining power of PTA on signiﬁcantly blue-tilted tensor spectra.

Here, we update the forecasts on the tensor power spectrum amplitude r and the tilt nT
from the combination of CMB and laser interferometers, considering in particular, for the ﬁrst
time in the literature, the two conﬁgurations LiteBIRD+LISA and LiteBIRD+BBO, focusing
on testing the standard slow-roll scenario and the inﬂationary consistency relation. Diﬀerently
from all the works cited above, we take into account foregrounds for all experiments. We bin
the LISA and BBO10 sensitivity curves with ∆ ln k = 2.0 and 4.0, respectively. We explore
the full cosmological parameters space including {AS, nS, τ , Ωbh2, Ωch2, H0, r, nT } via the
Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). We consider also another case in which we additionally

We modify the MontePython MCMC package [151, 152] by adding a Gaussian likelihood for
the interferometers [153]

the nS, r and nT parameters (without ﬁtting for the running) for four possible observational
conﬁgurations: (i) constraints from LiteBIRD alone (red contours); (ii) constraints from Lite-

and (iv) constraints from LiteBIRD and BBO assuming the ﬁducial signal in the LiteBIRD

because, to have an undetectable signal at interferometers scales, the spectrum must have a
large red tilt, so large that it aﬀects also the CMB scales. Therefore, even in the absence
of a consistency relation detection, if we do not detect a signal in BBO, the red tilt in the
power-law model of tensor power spectrum has to be so large that we can detect its departure
from the single-ﬁeld slow-roll consistency relation.

6 Conclusions and prospects

We have calculated the sensitivities of CMB, PTA, and direct detection experiments for
SGWB from the primordial GW across 21 decades in frequency. Not only do we provide the
sensitivity curves for the GW energy density parameter ΩGW (Figure 8) as commonly done in
the literature, but also we provide the binned 1σ error bars on the model predictions for ΩGW
from two representative classes of sources of the primordial SGWB: the quantum vacuum
ﬂuctuation in the metric tensor (i.e., the homogeneous solution of Einstein’s equation) from
single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation models with r = 0.01 and r = 0.001 and the tensor tilt and
its running given by the consistency relation, and the source-induced primordial GW from
the spectator axion-SU(2) model (i.e., from the stress energy tensor in the right hand side of
Einstein’s equation).

For CMB and PTA we considered the most ambitious future experiments LiteBIRD and
SKA, respectively, while for direct detection experiments we considered a host of funded and
proposed space (LISA, µAres, DO, AEDGE, DECIGO, BBO) and ground-based (ET) GW
7 to 103 Hz. We took into account
observatories covering a wide range of frequencies from 10−
the instrumental noise, the response functions, and most importantly the contamination of
the astrophysical foregrounds in the forecasts. We have presented all the details in our
computation with homogeneous assumptions for all experiments in one place, which should
provide convenient resources for the experiments in search of the primordial SGWB.

We showed that it is possible to tune the axion-SU(2) model parameters to have detec-
tions with high signiﬁcance in multiple frequency bins in both the CMB and space interfer-
ometers frequency ranges, even when accounting for the foreground contamination (Figures
9-13), while remaining consistent with all current upper limits. We also showed that the pa-
rameters of the axion-SU(2) model can be chosen in such a way that the signal is out of reach
for CMB experiments, while being detectable by the most sensitive space interferometers, i.e.,
µAres, DECIGO (but only without the foregrounds) and BBO (Figures 14-16).

On the other hand, the situation is diﬀerent for future ground-based interferometers,
for which the current estimates for the foreground contamination prevent detections of the
axion-SU(2) model. It is also diﬃcult to obtain a tensor spectrum detectable by the SKA
experiment on PTA scales in presence of the foreground, while still complying with the BI-
CEP2/Keck/Planck upper bound on CMB scales (Figure 17). This is due to the attractor
behaviour of the axion-SU(2) model, posing an upper limit on the width of the spectrum
bump for a given peak scale kp.

For what concerns the single-ﬁeld slow-roll power spectrum, we showed that the r = 0.01
model can be detected comfortably and simultaneously by LiteBIRD, by BBO (Figure 19),
by µAres (but only in the case without foregrounds, Figure 20), but not by DECIGO in its
standard design (Figure 18). We also found that the lower tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.001
can be detected only by LiteBIRD, while not even the ultra-sensitive BBO can detect such a
signal on the interferometers side (Figure 21).

Finally, we presented updated constraints on r and nT combining LiteBIRD with LISA
and LiteBIRD with BBO, to leverage on the scale dependence of the tensor spectrum. We con-
clude that distinguishing the single-ﬁeld slow-roll consistency relation from the scale-invariant
case remains out of reach even for LiteBIRD+BBO. However, if we detect tensors in the CMB
but not in BBO, we would detect a signiﬁcant deviation from the consistency relation in the
context of the power-law primordial spectrum.

If the primordial SGWB is discovered during the next decade by ground-based CMB
observatories or LiteBIRD, characterizing the power spectrum beyond the value of r and
testing chirality and Gaussianity would be of utmost importance for deciphering of the origin
of the SGWB. If the discovered SGWB were found to be nearly scale-invariant, parity even
and Gaussian, it would set a target for the µAres, DECIGO and BBO to test the prediction
of single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation models. On the other hand, if the SGWB were found to be
blue-tilted, chiral or non-Gaussian, it would give excellent prospects for direct detection by

A Interferometers Designs and Response Functions

A necessary ingredient to compute the sensitivity curve of a GW direct SGWB experiment
(Eq. 4.12) is the overlap reduction function RIJ (f ) of the detector pair IJ (Eq. 4.9) [129],
which is computed from the response function TI (f, ˆn) of each of the detector involved in

– 36 –

the cross-correlation (Eq. 4.6). We summarize here the formalism necessary to compute it,
following Ref. [46] to which we refer the reader for further details.

The overlap reduction function depends on the design of the detector and the combi-
nation of laser signals from the interferometer arms that we choose to form at the detector
output. The response of space interferometers can also depend on time because of the or-
bital motion of the spacecrafts composing the detector; however, for simplicity we ignore this
dependence.

Let us start by considering the response of a single arm of the interferometer, from
which we build the response of the full detector. The physical principle behind the detection
of GWs in a laser interferometer is simple: the passage of GWs changes the proper distance
between two freely moving test-masses at the opposite ends of an interferometer arm, causing
phase-shifts in the laser beams which are traveling back-and-forth in each arm. It can be
shown [46] that the phase change due to light traveling from the test-mass i to the test-mass
j along a single interferometer arm is

To build the detector responses for the experiments we consider in this paper, we start
from the simplest design adopted for the LISA mission. The current proposal for LISA
showcases three spacecrafts, each occupying a vertex (cid:126)xi with i = A, B, C of an equilateral
triangle ABC of side L = 2.5 × 109 m; laser beams (six in total) travel back and forth along
each of the triangle sides. We compute the response function for LISA using the standard
Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) signals.
In this particular case [42], the interferometer
response function at the detector vertex A reads

2if /f ∗ for the TDI signals
we are interested in. Speciﬁcally, the TDI A and E modes overlap reduction function11 for
LISA (the blue curve in Figure 23) will be

RA,E = RABC, ABC − RABC, BCA,

(A.8)

is the

where RABC, ABC

is the response for the auto-correlation at the vertex A and RABC, BCA

We use TDI signals to compute the overlap reduction function also for DO (green curve
in Figure 23), which has been proposed as a LISA-like interferometer with shorter arms of
lenght L = 108 m.

Diﬀerently from the LISA and DO detectors, BBO will feature six spacecrafts forming
two independent triangular LISA-like interferometers ABC and A(cid:48)B(cid:48)C(cid:48) with sides L = 5×107
m. The two interferometers will be co-planar with one being rotated by 180° with respect to
the other, creating the so-called “hexagram” conﬁguration.

In this case, it is convenient to introduce another signal combination that we can form
from the Michelson signals smich,A(t) and smich,C(t) at the vertices A and C of one interfer-
ometer, respectively [46]

sX (t) = smich,A(t) + 2smich,C(t).
The detector response function for the Michelson signal smich,A(t) at the vertex A takes the
form in Eq. A.6, while the one for the sX (t) signal combination is given by

(A.9)

X (ˆn, f ) = T ab
T ab

ABC(ˆn, f ) + 2T ab

C AB(ˆn, f ),

(A.10)

and for both responses the transfer function T (ˆl · ˆn, f ) is given by Eq. A.7 with W (f, f ∗) = 1.
Now, to compute the overlap reduction function for the BBO hexagram conﬁguration,
at the vertex A on the interferometer ABC and
we cross-correlate the Michelson signal smich,A
the combination sX (cid:48)(t) = smich,A(cid:48)(t)+2smich,C(cid:48)(t) on the other interferometer A(cid:48)B(cid:48)C(cid:48) [46] (the
black curve in Figure 23). As shown in [46], it is convenient then to correlate the Michelson
signal smich,A(t) with the signal combination s(cid:48)
X (t), because the total noises for these two
signals will be uncorrelated over the frequencies at which space-based interferometers are
typically most sensitive. The ﬁnal overlap reduction function for this signal combination [46]
will be

RHexagram = RABC, ABC + RX (cid:48),X (cid:48) + 2RABC, X (cid:48).

(A.11)

The DECIGO design is similar to the BBO, with two independent triangular interferom-
eters with arms L = 106 m disposed in the hexagram conﬁguration. Unlike BBO, however, the
current DECIGO design envisages Fabry-Pérot (hereafter FP) interferometers; the response
function at the vertex A [146] becomes therefore

(A.12)

and – similarly to what we do for BBO – we cross-correlate it with the response at the vertex
A(cid:48) on the second interferometer, obtaining the overlap reduction function depicted in the
orange curve in Figure 23.

11The three TDI signals are constructed by diagonalizing the signal covariance matrix and are named the
A, E and T modes. Note that Eq. A.8 is valid only for the A and E TDI modes, which happen to be the most
sensitive to the SGWB, while the T mode is much less sensitive and is used instead to remove noise from the
A and E modes [42].

Figure 23: Absolute value of the overlap reduction functions |RIJ | normalized to 1, computed
for the interferometers LISA, DECIGO, DO, BBO, µAres.

The µAres experiment will be composed, similarly to DECIGO and BBO, by two iden-
tical triangular LISA-like constellations with arms L = 430 × 109 m. However, in this case
one of the two triangular interferometer would be trailing Mars orbit within the ecliptic plane
while the other would be in the same orbit but 90° tilted with respect to the ecliptic plane
[43]. In order to compute the overlap reduction function for µAres, we adopt again the same
method employed for BBO, taking into account the design diﬀerences. We show the resulting
curve in the purple line in Figure 23.

Finally, we take into consideration the ET ground-based experiment. The current pro-
posal consists of a network of three interferometers with arm opening of 60 degrees, arranged
in a such a way to form an equilateral triangle. For the ET experiment there is no need
to compute the overlap reduction function, since the strain sensitivity curves (as deﬁned in
Eq. 4.13) are publicly available12.

B Interferometers Noise Models

To compute the sensitivity curve in Eq. 4.12 we need not only the overlap reduction function,
but also the noise power spectral density Sn(f ) for each detector (Eq. 4.3). Let us start from
the LISA mission. Following Ref. [42], we use the noise models reported in the LISA Science
Requirements Document13: the two main noise sources are acceleration noise and optical
metrology noise, with spectra
