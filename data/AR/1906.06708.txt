We  have  calculated  partial  contributions  of  different  endohedral  and  atomic  subshells  to  the 
total  dipole  sum  rule  in  the  frame  of  the  random  phase  approximation  with  exchange  (RPAE)  and 
found  that  they  are  essentially  different  from  the numbers  of  electrons  in  respective  subshells.  This 
difference  manifests  the  strength  of  the  intershell  interaction.  We  present  concrete  results  of 
calculations  for  endohedrals,  composed  of  fullerene  C60  and  all  noble  gases He,  Ne,  Ar,  Kr  and  Xe 
thus  forming  respectively  He@C60,  Ne@C60,  Ar@C60,  Kr@C60,  and  Xe@C60.  For  comparison  we 
obtained similar results for isolated noble gas atoms. The deviation from number of electrons in outer 
subshells  proved  to  be  much  bigger  in  endohedrals  than  in  isolated  atoms  thus  demonstrating 
considerably stronger intershell correlations there.

Introductory remarks 

In this paper we investigate the role of intershell correlations in atoms and endohedrals, 
i.e.  fullerenes  staffed  by  some  other  atom.  Investigation  of  electron  correlations  in  isolated 
atoms since long ago was and still is an important area of studies in the physics of atoms. As 
correlation  we  consider  the  effects  of  that  part  of  the  inter-electron  interaction  which  is 
neglected in the frame of a crude  picture of an  atom  that  treats  atomic  electrons  as  moving 
independently,  each  one  in  the  field  of  the  nucleus  and  the  so-called  self-consistent  field 
created by averaged action of all other electrons. The most accurate choice of the one-electron 
field is the Hartree-Fock approximation (HF) (see, e.g. [1] and references therein). 

To take into account  the  electron correlations we will  use  the  so-called  random  phase 
approximation with exchange (RPAE) that gives particularly good results in photoionization 
calculations  that  is  the  objects  of  this  research  [1,  2].  In  RPAE  frame  it  is  natural  to 
distinguish intra- and intershell correlations. The former include interaction of electrons that 
belong to a given atomic subshell while the latter are results on interaction of electrons that 
belong to different subshells (or shells).  These  correlations in the physics  of atoms  are  well 
reflected in the absolute and differential cross section of photoionization of atomic subshells 
and result in formation of prominent resonances in the partial photoionization cross-sections 
[2], e.g. the interference resonances [3]. Recently it was disclosed that intershell correlations 
in atoms are strongly reflected in the so-called partial dipole sum-rules [4]. 

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the influence of a very big (as compared to 
atomic) fullerene electron shell affect very strong the partial photoionization cross-sections of 
an encapsulated atom and this effect is prominently reflected in the partial sum-rules of this 
atom. These modifications of the partial sum rules demonstrate directly the importance of the 
intershell  interaction  in  photoionization  of  endohedrals  that  is  dominated  by  the  interaction 
between atomic and fullerenes electrons. Thus, we intend to demonstrate that by studying the 
dipole sum rule that correspond to a given  subshell  of an  endohedral one obtains  important 
information on the interaction between electrons of this subshell and the fullerenes electrons.

Here  I  is  the  ionization  potential  and  c  is  the  speed  of  light.  The  relation  (1)  is  a  strict 
theoretical  statement  in  non-relativistic  approximation,  but  experimentally  observed  cross-
sections  and  oscillator  strengths  has  admixtures  of  non-dipole  contributions  and  of  a  whole 
variety  of  relativistic  corrections.  These  corrections  grow  rapidly  with  increase  of  and 
become dominative in

Known almost half a century, the random phase approximation with exchange (RPAE) 
gives  very  good  results  in  description  of  partial  photoionization  cross-sections,  angular 
distributions  of  photoelectrons  and  spin  polarization  parameters  of  isolated  atoms  [1].  An 
interesting  feature  of  this  approximation  is  the fact that  the  dipole  sum  rule  (1)  is  precisely 
valid in its frame. Recently, however, we investigate the partial sum rules in RPAE frame and 
have demonstrated that, unexpectedly, for multi-electron  f and d subshells of isolated atoms 
fS and dS   (see  (2))  are  considerably  bigger  than  the  respective

Here we perform calculations for noble gas endohedrals, in which noble gas atoms are 
stuffed inside an almost ideally spherical fullerene C60. We employ the one-electron Hartree-
Fock (HF) approximation, in both length and velocity forms of the operator that describes the 
photon-electron  interaction,  denoted  by  upper  indexes  L  and   .  We  use  HF  equations 
properly modified to take into account the additional potential that reproduces the fullerenes 
shell (see, e.g. [8] and references therein).  In  HF  the  relation  (1)  is essentially  violated. We 
take into account the multi-electron correlations using RPAE generalized in such a way that

Note  that  in  RPAE  frame  the  Eq.  (1)  is  valid.  In  this  sense,  it  exist  a  fundamental 
difference  between  ordinary  and  endohedral  atoms.  For  ordinary  atoms  Eq.  (1)  has  to  be 
fulfilled, while for endohedrals – not, since endohedral is a subsystem of the total system that 
consist  of  atom  A  and  fullerene  CN,  with  its  total  number  of  electron  equal  to

Along  with  static  fullerenes  potential  UC(r)  in  (3),  in  the  frame  of  RPAE  for 
endohedrals one  has to  include  the  dipole  polarization  of  the fullerene  electron  shell  by  the

Results of calculations 
We performed calculations using computing codes system ATOM-M [10]. Tables 1-5 collect 
the results for total S and partial Si sums, defined by (1) and (2). The results for He@C60 and 
He (Table 1) demonstrate an important role on fullerene shell even in He case. Note that for

He 
increases its contribution by more than a factor of 2. Table 3 presents results for Ar@C60 and 
Ar. The contribution of 1s, 2s, and 3s almost completely disappears. The 2p-subshell is a loser

(-0.65)  in  Ar@C60,  but  a  winner  in  Ar  (+0.99).  The  biggest  winner  is  3p.  Table  4 
demonstrates  the  results  for  Kr@C60  and  Kr.  Again,  contributions  of  s-subshells  decrease 
impressively, particularly that of 4s. As in Ar case, 2p-subshell is a loser (-1) in Kr@C60, but 
a  winner  in  Kr  (+1.01).  3p  is  a  loser  (~-2.6),  while  3d  is  a  big  winner  (+4.7).  The  biggest 
winner, with (+29!) is 4p in Kr. Table 5 presents the results for Xe@C60 and Xe. As in other 
cases,  all  s-subshells  are  losers.  The  same  is  for  p-subshells,  except  the  outer  5p  that  for 
Xe@C60 is a very big winner (+25.7). As to 3d and 4d, for Xe@C60 and Xe they are winners, 
acquiring from +2.31 for 3d in Xe to 5.3 for 4d in Xe@C60. 

Our calculations show that all partial sums Si are essentially different from the number 
of electrons  in  the  respective  subshell  Ni.  The  difference  takes  place  not only  in  RPAE  but 
even stronger in HF, thus signalling redistributing  of  oscillator  strength  already on  the  one-
electron  HF  level.  Comparison  with  isolated  atoms  demonstrates  that  the  presence  of  the 
fullerene shell considerably enhances, particularly for outer subshells, the deviation from the 
number of electrons in the respective subshells.

In studies of multi-electron atoms that require complex numeric calculations it is hard to

Discussion and conclusions 
By  studying  the  partial  sum  rules,  we  demonstrated  here  that  intershell  interaction  affects 
prominently  the  absolute  photoionization  cross-section  of  endohedrals  in  a  very  broad 
frequency  range  that  is  reflected  on  the  partial  sum  rule  level.  It  demonstrates  previously 
unobserved overall sufficiently strong intershell or interference interaction in both atoms and 
endohedrals.  Before,  such  interaction  was  considered  as  a  rather  specific  feature  that  is 
effective  in  relatively  narrow    regions  only  in  few  outer  shells,  and  near  so-called  Giant 
resonances of the intermediate subshells [3, 15]. No doubt that similar to presented here is the 
situation for many other endohedrals and isolated atoms. 

It  would  be  very  interesting  to  perform  experimental  investigation  aiming  to 
demonstrate the prominent violation of the partial sum rules. This is not a simple task, having 
in mind that for each subshell i the measurements must be performed in a broad region in 
coincidence with creation of only i vacancy. However, such an experiment would be of great 
importance  for  the  understanding  of  electronic  structure  of  endohedrals,  as  well  as  isolated 
atoms.
