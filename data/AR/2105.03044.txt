Motivated by the variation in reported lattice parameters of ﬂoating-zone-grown Nd2Zr2O7 crystals, we have
performed a detailed study of the relationship between synthesis environment, structural disorder, and magnetic
properties. Using a combination of polycrystalline standards, electron-probe microanalysis and scattering tech-
niques, we show that crystals grown under atmospheric conditions have a reduced lattice parameter – relative
to pristine polycrystalline powders – due to occupation of the Nd-site by excess Zr (i.e. “negative” stufﬁng).
In contrast, crystals grown under high-pressure Ar are nearly stoichiometric with an average lattice parameter
approaching the polycrystalline value. While minimal disorder of the oxygen sublattices is observed on the
scale of the average structure, neutron pair-distribution function analysis indicates a highly local disorder of the
oxygen coordination, which is only weakly dependent on growth environment. Most importantly, our magne-
tization, heat capacity and single-crystal neutron scattering data show that the magnetic properties of crystals
grown under high-pressure Ar match closely with those of stoichiometric powders. Neutron scattering measure-
ments reveal that the signature of magnetic moment fragmentation – the coexistence of “all-in-all-out” (AIAO)
magnetic Bragg peaks and diffuse pinch-point scattering due to spin-ice correlations – persists in these nearly
stoichiometric crystals. However, in addition to an increased AIAO transition temperature, the diffuse signal is
seemingly stabilized and remains nearly unchanged upon warming to 800 mK. This behavior indicates that both
the AIAO magnetic order and spin-ice correlations are sensitive to deviations of the Nd stoichiometry.

INTRODUCTION

Rare-earth pyrochlore oxides (A2B2O7, where A = rare-
earth and B = a wide range of transition metals) have long
sustained a variety of research efforts within the condensed
matter community [1–4]. Recently, experimental [5–8] and
theoretical [9–11] work has highlighted novel magnetic and
electronic behaviors related to the dipolar-octupolar ground
state doublet of certain (Kramers) rare-earth ions. Particu-
lar attention has been focused on Nd2Zr2O7 following exper-
imental observation of behavior consistent with a picture of
magnetic moment fragmentation, where different “fragments”
of the Nd3+ moment operate as separate degrees of freedom.
The idea of magnetic moment fragmentation proposed in
the context of emergent Coulomb phases is based on the crys-
tallization of monopole excitations from a spin ice ground
In this theory, a Helmholtz decomposition is
state [12].
used to divide the magnetization ﬁeld into “divergence-full”
and “divergence-free” components.
Initially, the local con-
straint of the spin ice state produces a magnetization that is
wholly divergence-free. Fragmentation then occurs upon the
crystallization of a sufﬁcient density of monopole excitations
and the development of a divergence-full contribution to the
sublattice magnetization. The result is a magnetically or-
dered state (divergence-full) and a ﬂuctuating Coulomb phase
(divergence-free). Such a state results from a complex inter-
play of strong, Ising-like anisotropy, effective ferromagnetic
(FM) interactions and a delicate balance of the magnetic ex-
change and dipolar interactions [12, 13].

The phenomenon of moment fragmentation can also be ad-
dressed by explicitly considering the dipolar-octupolar char-
acter of the ground state Kramers doublet of Nd3+ ions in
Nd2Zr2O7 [14]. The differing symmetries of the resulting
pseudo-spin operators (τ ) [9] result in a magnetization ﬁeld
derived from x and z terms which generate gapped mag-
netic ﬂuctuations and magnetic order, respectively. Each
component contributes differently to the divergence-full and
divergence-free components of the total magnetization such
that the ﬂuctuations of these ﬁelds are decoupled [14].

Regardless of the precise theoretical description, Nd2Zr2O7
shows the coexistence of magnetic order – the antiferro-
magnetic (AFM) “all-in-all-out” (AIAO) state with reports
of TAF M from 285 to 400 mK [15–19] – and a ﬂuctuating
Coulomb phase [13, 20]. In neutron scattering measurements,
these states manifest as simultaneous magnetic Bragg peaks
and an inelastic, diffuse “pinch-point” scattering pattern, re-
spectively [12–14, 18, 21]. The availability of large, single-
crystal samples of Nd2Zr2O7 grown by the ﬂoating-zone (FZ)
technique [22] has been instrumental to experimental inves-
tigations of the proposed magnetically fragmented state and
its related magnetic properties [13, 18–20, 23–25]. How-
ever, truly verifying and understanding this state requires care-
ful investigation of crystal quality, especially considering the
well-known susceptibility of the pyrochlore lattice to disorder
[1, 26, 27].

In the case of Nd2Zr2O7, deviation from unity of the Nd/Zr
ratio is known to modify the cubic lattice parameter in poly-
crystalline samples [28]. Reported FZ-grown crystals show
a marked variation in lattice parameter [22, 23] relative to the
value for pristine polycrystalline samples, where the Nd/Zr ra-
tio is well-controlled and likely very close to 1 [16, 22] (see
Fig. 1). FZ-grown crystals studied in the literature possess up

FIG. 1. Comparison of lattice parameters for polycrystalline sam-
ples and single crystals from this work and the literature [16, 22, 23].
All lattice parameters were determined from laboratory XRD on
powders at T = 300 K. The error bars are contained within the sym-
bols and represent one standard deviation

to a ≈ 0.5% smaller lattice parameter and often have substan-
tially reduced AIAO ordering temperatures relative to powder
data [13, 15, 16, 19, 22]. Disorder on the oxygen sublattice is
also possible, where, for instance, local disorder related to the
high-temperature defect-ﬂuorite structure is known to occur
[29, 30]. A visual summary of a number of key defect modes
is shown in Fig. 2.

The presence of disorder can substantially renormalize in-
teractions relative to theoretical considerations and support
a complex local coexistence of states. For example, it has
been suggested that intrinsic cation disorder in YbMgGaO4
leads to the lack of observed magnetic order [31], while oxy-
gen deﬁciency in Y2Ti2O7 generates a paramagnetic response
[32]. Furthermore, the FZ-growth process can lead to dra-
matic differences between powder and single crystal samples,
such as the extensive variation (even between different FZ-
grown single-crystal samples) of the heat capacity signatures
in Yb2Ti2O7 [33–35]. As such, it is important to consider
what sources of structural disorder are present in Nd2Zr2O7
single crystals and how this disorder might be managed by
modifying the FZ-growth conditions. The ability to mod-
ify the amount of disorder leads naturally to addressing how
disorder affects the bulk magnetic properties, including the
experimental signatures of magnetic moment fragmentation
[36].

In this paper, we leverage the high-temperature/high-
pressure (HP) capabilities of laser-based FZ-growth [37] to
synthesize Nd2Zr2O7 samples with lattice parameters ap-
proaching those of pristine polycrystalline samples. Using a
series of polycrystalline samples, we conﬁrm the correlation
between the Nd/Zr ratio and the lattice parameter and examine

the effect on magnetic properties. Electron probe microanaly-
sis (EPMA) provides direct conﬁrmation that samples grown
in atmospheric conditions (1 bar, air) with a reduced lattice
parameter have Nd/Zr < 1, while those grown in HP Ar (70
bar) are nearly stoichiometric. A detailed structural investiga-
tion of powdered single-crystals studied via synchrotron x-ray
and neutron diffraction clariﬁes that this stoichiometry imbal-
ance is accommodated by Zr occupying vacancies on the Nd
sublattice. Synchrotron diffraction data also reveal a distribu-
tion of lattice parameters within FZ-grown crystals: growth
in air skews the distribution towards a smaller average lat-
tice parameter while growth in HP Ar favors a larger aver-
age lattice parameter. Although the oxygen sublattices are
close to disorder free on the scale of the average structure
(< 2% vacancies), pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis
of the neutron data indicates 8 – 11 mass % of a highly local
disorder of the oxygen-coordination across all samples. Cru-
cially, we present magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron
scattering measurements showing that the magnetic properties
of HP Ar-grown crystals match closely with that of stoichio-
metric polycrystalline powders. Neutron scattering measure-
ments on nearly stoichiometric crystals conﬁrm the contin-
ued coexistence of AIAO magnetic Bragg peaks and a diffuse
pinch-point scatterin pattern, with the latter signal persisting
nearly unchanged at higher temperatures than previously re-
ported [13, 38]. These results suggest that the stability of
both the AIAO magnetic order and the spin-ice correlations
are linked to Nd stoichiometry.

II. METHODS

Polycrystalline samples of Nd2(1−x)Zr2(1+x)O7 (x = 0.2,
0.05, 0 and –0.1) were synthesized using solid state methods.
Stoichiometric amounts of dried (900 ◦C, 12 hours) Nd2O3
(Aﬂa Aesar, 99.99%) and ZrO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.98%) were
ground together in an agate mortar and pestle and pressed
into pellets at 310 MPa in a cold isostatic press. The pellets
were then reacted in air in Al2O3 crucibles for 60 hours each
at 1300, 1375 and 1450 ◦C with re-grinding and re-pressing
between reactions. Platinum was always placed between the
sample and Al2O3 crucible to prevent possible reaction at high
temperatures. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Pana-
lytical Emperyan diffractometer was employed to evaluate the
ﬁnal product. All Rietveld reﬁnements were performed using
the TOPAS software package [39]. In preparation for crystal
growth, the x = 0 powder was packed into clean rubber bal-
loons and pressed into rods (diameter ≈ 4 mm, length ≈ 80 –
100 mm) at 310 MPa in a cold isostatic press. The rods were
sintered at 1450 ◦C for 24 – 48 hours, in air, on sacriﬁcial beds
of x = 0 powder.

Single-crystal samples were then grown via the ﬂoating-
zone method, using a novel, high-pressure laser furnace,
the details of which are described elsewhere [37]. Growths
were conducted in atmospheric conditions (1 bar, air) and at
high-pressure (70 bar) of Ar (HP-Ar) or an Ar:O2 = 80:20
mix (HP-80:20). Signiﬁcant volatility was observed during
the growths in air; less volatility was observed in the high-
pressure growths. Other parameters were held constant across
these growths, including translation rate (30 mm/hour for both
feed and seed), rotation rate (counter rotation at 6 – 8 rpm),
and molten zone temperature (2400 – 2500 ◦C). Note that
this temperature is a relative metric using an uncorrected py-
rometer. Laboratory XRD conﬁrms that all crystals grown
contained only the pyrochlore phase in the average structure.
Thermally induced cracking was observed in all samples, con-
sistent with other reports [22] and was likely exacerbated by
the steep temperature gradient attained by laser heating. Vary-
ing the growth rate modiﬁed this effect, with extreme cracking
and ﬂaking at 12.5 mm/hour and very minimal cracking at 60
mm/hour, but did not otherwise modify the results with re-
spect to the lattice parameter or phase purity. The relatively
rapid growth rate represents a compromise between constrain-
ing the thermally induced cracking to only localized fractures
and maintaining crystallinity.

The composition of crystals was analyzed using an EPMA
(Cameca SX-100, Gennevilliers, France) equipped with
wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy. Sample disks – thin
cross sections of the as-grown, cylindrical crystal boule cut
perpendicular to the growth direction – were polished with
colloidal diamond to a 0.25 µm ﬁnish. The mounts were car-
bon coated to negate electron beam charging. A 20 kV and
20 nA beam was used for the measurements, which was de-
focused to 2 µm to prevent sample damage. Multiple “spot”
measurements were used to determine the composition at var-
ious points within a small (100 × 100 µm2), region at the
center of the sample disk. Line scans along the diameter
of the sample disk (from edge to edge) were used to assess

3

any compositional variance along the boule diameter. The Zr
and Nd concentration measurements were standardized using
a synthetic zircon (ZrSiO4) standard and Nd-glass standard,
respectively. In the calculation of the average formula the O
was assumed to be fully stoichiometric (i.e. NdxZryO7). We
emphasize that, due to the use of standards, the EPMA data
provide an independent measurement of the Nd and Zr con-
centrations and the resulting formula need not show x+y = 4
to match the ideal formula.

Structural characterization was undertaken using syn-
chrotron XRD and time-of-ﬂight (TOF) neutron diffraction
on powdered crystal boules. The synchrotron XRD measure-
ments were performed at the 11-BM beamline of the Ad-
vanced Photon Source (APS) at T = 100 K. To minimize ab-
sorption effects, the powder was diluted with SiO2 at a ratio
of 1:7 (molar), yielding µR ≈ 0.6 , before being loaded into
0.8 mm diameter Kapton tubes. TOF neutron powder diffrac-
tion data were collected using the POWGEN diffractometer
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Spallation Neutron Source
(SNS). The wavelength distribution of the incident beam was
centered at 1.5 ˚A, with a minimum of 0.967 ˚A and maximum
of 2.033 ˚A, providing a Q range of ≈ 0.43 – 12.94 ˚A−1. The
powder (2.5 – 3 g of ground FZ crystal) was sealed in 6 mm
diameter V cans and measured at T = 100 K. The POWGEN
data was reduced for pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis
using Mantid [40]. Analysis of the total scattering data was
then performed using the PDFgui software suite over various
increments of a total r-range of 1.5 – 41.5 ˚A [41].

Bulk magnetic properties were measured on ≈ 10 mg of
powder (both polycrystalline powders and ground crystals)
mounted in polypropylene capsules using a MPMS3 Quantum
Design SQUID magnetometer. Well-ground crystals were
used to eliminate any effects of crystalline anisotropy and for
comparison to the nominally stoichiometric polycrystalline
sample. High-ﬁeld M(H) measurements were carried out us-
ing a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) mounted on a
Quantum Design DynaCool Physical Properties Measurement
System (PPMS) equipped with a 14 T magnet. We only make
comparisons to the literature between data sets collected using
the same measurement technique (SQUID or VSM). Measure-
ments of the low temperature speciﬁc heat (CP ) were carried
out using a Quantum Design Dynacool PPMS equipped with
a dilution refrigerator insert. The samples used for the mea-
surement were taken from the center of the crystal boules with
masses < 0.5 mg. Apiezon N-grease was used to provide ther-
mal contact.

Single-crystal neutron diffraction was performed using the
instrument CORELLI at the SNS. An intial survey of sam-
ples grown under different environments was performed at
the NIST Center for Neutron Research using the cold neu-
tron triple-axis diffractometer SPINS in order to inform the
CORELLI experiment. The sample consisted of a piece ex-
tracted from the crystal boule with length ≈ 2.5 cm and mass
≈ 1.3 g. Copper foil was used to attach the crystal to an
oxygen-free copper mount to ensure adequate thermalization;
in the CORELLI experiment a Cd mask was used to reduce
scattering from the mount and N-grease was also placed at the
interface between the crystal and the mount. The crystal was

then mounted in a liquid helium cryostat with a dilution in-
sert, providing a base temperature of ≈ 38 mK. Data across a
large area of reciprocal space were collected at T = 38, 500,
and 800 mK by rotating the crystal around the [1¯10] direction
(ω rotation) in 1◦ steps with a count time of ≈ 3 minutes/step.
A magnetic order parameter on the (220) reﬂection was col-
lected by ﬁxing ω such that the peak could be measured. The
CORELLI data was reduced using Mantid [42]. Conﬁdence
intervals for all error bars and uncertainties represent plus and
minus one standard deviation.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Structural Properties Characterization

To provide a baseline in understanding how the Nd/Zr ra-
tio impacts the properties of Nd2(1−x)Zr2(1+x)O7, a series
of polycrystalline samples (“standards”) were ﬁrst prepared.
The lattice parameter for the Nd-deﬁcient (x > 0) samples de-
creases linearly with decreasing Nd/Zr relative to the x = 0
samples (Fig. 3). For the Nd-enriched sample (x < 0), the lat-
tice parameter deviates from the linear trend, likely reﬂecting
the fact that it was biphasic, with ≈ 5 mass % Nd2O3. How-
ever, it is still clearly enhanced relative to the stoichiometric
sample. Due to the lower processing temperature, the Nd/Zr
ratios are assumed as the nominal values of the polycrystalline
samples and these values were ﬁxed during the reﬁnement
of the powder data used to determine the lattice parameters.
The results are consistent with those of a previous study on
Nd2(1−x)Zr2(1+x)O7 powders [28].

A comparison can then be performed between the composi-
tion and structure of single crystals grown in a variety of envi-
ronments. The lattice parameters of single crystals (all based
on laboratory XRD) reported in the literature and in this work
are summarized in Fig. 1, with polycrystalline values plot-
ted for comparison. Reported values for low-pressure, air-
grown samples vary considerably, ranging from 10.627 [24]
to 10.662 ˚A (this work), but are in all cases reduced compared
to the polycrystalline samples (≈ 10.68 ˚A). In contrast, sam-
ples grown in 70 bar of Ar show an elevated lattice parameter
(10.675 ˚A) which approaches that of the polycrystalline sam-
ples.

Nd and Zr stoichiometries for two single-crystals (air and
HP-Ar), determined by the EPMA measurements, are shown
in Fig. 4. Spot measurements, taken in a small, central
area of the boule, show a consistent difference in stoichiom-
etry between the two samples. The air-grown sample has
Nd/Zr = .918 (average formula = Nd1.90Zr2.07O7) while the
HP Ar-grown sample has Nd/Zr = .985 (average formula =
Nd1.98Zr2.01O7). In contrast, line scans, taken across a larger
extent of the sample, show an increased range of values rela-
tive to the spot measurements. The spread of the Nd and Zr
stoichiometric coefﬁcients is roughly 0.15 for the air-grown
sample and 0.10 for the HP-Ar sample. However, the average
stoichiometry of the line scans mirrors the behavior seen in
the spot measurements: the air-grown sample has Nd/Zr < 1
while the HP-Ar sample has, on average, Nd/Zr closer to 1.

tory XRD versus nominal Nd/Zr ratio for polycrystalline samples of
Nd2(1−x)Zr2(1+x)O7 with x = 0.2, 0.05, 0, and -0.1. The error bars
are contained within the symbols and represent one standard devi-
ation. The Nd-enriched polycrystalline sample is biphasic (Nd2O3
+ “Nd2.2Zr1.8O7”) as is expected from the change in slope. The
dashed red line is a linear ﬁt to the phase pure samples while the
dashed black lines indicate the lattice parameters found by labora-
tory XRD for single crystal samples grown in this work.

The synchrotron X-ray and TOF neutron powder diffrac-
tion data for the HP-Ar and air-grown samples were analyzed
with a simultaneous Rietveld reﬁnement to provide deeper in-
sight into structural disorder on both the cation (Nd, Zr) and
anion (O) sites. The reﬁned patterns resulting from the struc-
tural model described below are shown in Fig. 5, with the
results for the reﬁned parameters summarized in Table I. For
both samples, all peaks could be matched to the pyrochlore
structure (Fd¯3m, space group number 227). In this structure
the Nd and Zr cations each occupy a distinct, high-symmetry,
site forming separate corner-sharing sublattices of Nd and Zr
tetrahedra. The O anion occupies two sites, referred to here
as O1 (Wyckoff position 48f ) and O2 (Wyckoff position 8b).
The pyrochlore unit cell is predominately constrained by sym-
metry and provides only u, the x-coordinate of the O1-site and
the lattice parameter (a) as free parameters.

Establishing a structural model for the co-reﬁnement was
complicated by the observation of a split-peak structure in the
higher momentum resolution X-ray data, but not the neutron
data, of both samples. To model this feature, the data were
reﬁned using two pyrochlore phases with different lattice pa-
rameters – a similar approach has been taken with other site-
mixed pyrochlores e.g. Ho2(1+x)Ti2(1−x)O7 [43]. We note
here that comparable high-resolution X-ray data for the HP-
80:20 sample were also collected and were not well ﬁt by
two pyrochlore phases, requiring the addition of further py-
rochlore phases to improve the ﬁt.
In the interest of estab-
lishing a parsimonious and consistent structural model for the

5

of the O1 and O2 site occupancies showed the O2 site to be
fully occupied while the O1 site has a small number of vacan-
cies (<2 %), consistent with the general trend in pyrochlores
of oxygen vacancies occurring preferentially on the 48f -site
[27, 29, 44]. The two pyrochlore phases were constrained to
have the same set of ADPs and the same value of u.

To gain insight into r-dependent behavior (i.e. local disor-
der that does not appear in the average structure) PDF spectra
were reﬁned using a “box-car” scheme. Fits to the G(r) data
were performed within a set r-range (rmin – rmax = 5 ˚A) at
various length scales (e.g. 0 – 5 ˚A, 5 – 10 ˚A). Reﬁnement
using the ideal pyrochlore structure results in relatively ﬂat
difference curves and reasonable ﬁt qualities (RW ≈ 10%) for
most of the r-range (not shown). However, a notable decrease
in ﬁt quality was found for all samples within the r = 1.5 – 6.5
˚A range (RW ≈ 13 – 16%), driven mainly by a poor ﬁt to the
peak at r = 2.6 ˚A. Calculation of site-speciﬁc partial PDF con-
tributions reveal this peak to be composed of both Nd – O and
O – O correlations, with the O – O correlations being purely
due to correlations between O1 sites. Reﬁning the O1 site oc-
cupation showed a minor reduction in O1 occupancy (< 3%)
with only marginal improvement to RW . However, inclusion
of a secondary defect ﬂuorite phase for the ﬁt in the r = 1.5 –
5 ˚A range resulted in a decrease in RW and an observable im-
provement in the ﬁt of the peak at 2.6 ˚A (Fig. 6). Reﬁnement
of the amount of the defect ﬂuorite structure shows the high-
est phase fraction (mass %) for the air-grown sample (11.2 ±
0.22 %), the lowest for the HP-Ar sample (8.2 ± 0.18 %) and
an intermediate amount (8.8 ± 0.18 %) for the HP-80:20 sam-
ple. Inclusion of this phase in the highest r-range (36.5 – 41.5
˚A) produced only a marginal improvement to the ﬁt (change
in RW of < 1). An increase in the amount of defect ﬂuorite is
also accompanied by additional positional disorder on the O1
site, indicated by an increase in the isotropic displacement pa-
rameter. The implications of this model are further addressed
in Section IV of this paper.

B. Magnetic Properties Characterization

Characterization of the bulk magnetic properties of the HP-
Ar crystal and x = 0 powder are shown in Fig. 7. The two
samples show nearly identical χ(T ) data. A Curie-Weiss
analysis was performed by ﬁrst ﬁtting χ(T ) to the equation
χV V +C / (T − ΘCW ), with χV V capturing the temperature-
independent contribution of the Van Vleck paramagnetism.
χ(T ) − χV V was then ﬁt to C / (T − ΘCW ) in the range
10 ≤ T ≤ 30 K to avoid the inﬂuence of short-range magnetic
correlations and crystal ﬁeld effects [16]. This gave ΘCW =
0.309(5) K and µef f = 2.60(2) µB/Nd for the HP-Ar crystal
and ΘCW = 0.386(4) K, µef f = 2.61(3) µB/Nd for the pow-
der.

Isothermal M (µ0H) data at 2 K for the powder standards
are plotted in Fig. 8. The Van Vleck contribution of the
Nd3+ ion has been subtracted using the slope of a linear ﬁt
made in the range 8 – 14 T, beyond the ﬁeld values where
the Nd moments saturate. The resulting saturation magneti-
zation, Msat, is lower for the Nd-deﬁcient samples, relative

results for a number of ”spot” measurements taken at different points

co-reﬁnement we restrict our comparison to the air and HP-
Ar-grown samples here.

Since the TOF neutron data show only one peak, due to
the coarser resolution, the lattice parameters were wholly de-
termined by the X-ray data and fed into the calculated pat-
tern for the neutron data. A somewhat analogous approach
was taken with respect to the calculated phase fractions of
each pyrochlore phase. The X-ray scale factors for the two
phases (SX1 and SX2) were reﬁned independently while only
one neutron scale factor (SN 1, corresponding to the major-
ity phase, as determined by the X-ray data) was reﬁned. The
other neutron scale factor (SN 2) was then calculated as SN 2 =
(SX2 / SX1) × SN 1 to ensure the same phase fractions as de-
termined in the X-ray data. Other values, including the site oc-
cupancies, anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs), and
u (O1 x-position) were reﬁned globally (i.e. against both pat-
terns). Based on the EPMA data, the Nd A-site occupancy
was ﬁxed to the average value of the spot measurements (Fig.
4) while the Zr B-site occupancy was ﬁxed to 1. Occupa-
tion of the A-site by Zr was then allowed later in the analysis,
constrained by a maximum total occupancy of 1. Reﬁnement

both yield a Msat(µ0H = 7 T) = 1.33 µB/Nd. For further
comparison, a value for Msat(µ0H = 5 T) = 1.27 µB/Nd has
been reported previously for polycrystalline Nd2Zr2O7 [16],
which agrees reasonably well with our data at the same ﬁeld
value. The black, dashed line is the approximate, powder-
averaged, Msat(µ0H = 7 T) for an air-grown single-crystal
sample with a particularly low lattice parameter (10.627 ˚A)
[24]. This estimate is calculated based on the reported val-
ues of Msat(µ0H = 7 T) along the [111], [110] and [100]
directions: Msat = (6M[100] + 12M[110] + 8M[111]) / 26 =
1.19 µB/Nd. The same calculation for a different single crys-
tal sample grown in air (lattice parameter = 10.651 ˚A) also
shows a value less than that of the HP-Ar crystal [18].

Extending comparisons of magnetic properties to lower
low-temperature

CP (T) data were collected for air, HP-Ar and HP-80:20 sam-
ples (Fig. 9). TAF M , the onset of long-range magnetic or-
der, is identiﬁed as the peak in CP (T), and the data across
the series of crystals show that TAF M is lowest for the crystal
grown under HP-80:20 (314 mK) and highest for the sample
grown under HP-Ar (355 mK). Compared to the air-grown
crystal, the magnetic entropy associated with the phase tran-
sition (∆S, integrated up to 2 K) is increased by ≈ 6% for
the HP-Ar crystal. This reﬂects the increase in the ordered
moment due to the reduction in off-stoichiometry.

Further characterization of the magnetic order within the
HP-Ar sample was accomplished by a single-crystal neutron
scattering measurement at CORELLI. The integrated intensi-
ties of the (220) reﬂection are plotted in Fig. 10(a). The inte-

in the (hhl) plane at T = 38 mK is shown in Fig. 10(b) with
a high-temperature data set (T = 10 K) subtracted. The data

While the diffuse scattering is naively not polluted by thermal
diffuse scattering, the energy of the gapped pinch-point mode
near 50 µeV [13, 18] is still integrated over in the ﬁnite energy
window of the cross-correlation analysis. The pattern is qual-
itatively very similar to previous reports, showing pinch-point
scattering characteristic of the spin-ice correlations within the
ﬂuctuating Coulomb phase [13, 18, 20].

To quantify the evolution of the pinch-point pattern with

temperature, the diffuse scattering was integrated in a lim-
ited rectangular region containing the arm of diffuse scatter-
ing along the (hhh) direction; the result is shown in Fig. 10(a).
Separate from this pinch-point scattering, a second region of
relatively isotropic, diffuse signal was also observed at T =
500 mK (above TAF M ) around the (220) and (113) reﬂec-
tions (Fig. 10(c)). Further above TAF M (T = 800 mK), this
diffuse signal broadens considerably and begins to bleed into
the persistent pinch-point pattern. The two diffuse scattering
signals above TAF M suggest separate regimes of short-range
magnetic correlations associated with the AIAO and spin-ice
order parameters, which we discuss in the next section.

IV. DISCUSSION

The signiﬁcant range of reported lattice parameters for FZ-
grown Nd2Zr2O7 single crystals (Fig.
1) is an indicator
of variable, synthesis-dependent, disorder. Characterization
of Nd2(1−x)Zr2(1+x)O7 polycrystalline samples, which have
more well-controlled stoichiometries than the FZ-grown sam-
ples, provides a benchmark if this disorder occurs on the Nd
and Zr sublattices. Considering the results from these sam-
ples, varying cation stoichiometry is the most likely explana-
tion for the range of reported lattice parameters of FZ-grown
samples. The melting point of Nd2Zr2O7 (≈ 2300 – 2350 ◦C
[46]) requires a high molten zone temperature leading to sig-
niﬁcant oxide vapor pressure during FZ-growth. Laboratory
XRD on volatilized powder, collected following growth under
ambient conditions, showed it to be primarily Nd2O3. There-
fore, this volatilization preferentially depletes the molten zone
of Nd2O3, which leads to a decrease in Nd/Zr of the grown
crystal and a reduced lattice parameter. Our EPMA data con-
ﬁrms this picture, directly linking the reduced lattice parame-
ter to Nd/Zr < 1. In comparison, application of high-pressure
Ar clearly helps to mitigate Nd2O3 volatility, resulting in a
crystal with a larger lattice parameter which the EPMA data
show to have a Nd/Zr ratio close to 1.

As a further check, the Nd/Zr ratios calculated using the
ﬁt to lattice parameters of polycrystalline standards (Fig. 3)
is found to compare well to the value extracted from EPMA
data. The ﬁt gives a Nd/Zr ratio of 0.94 for the air-grown
sample and 0.98 for the HP-Ar sample while the EPMA aver-
age shows 0.92 and 0.99, respectively. For comparison, the ﬁt
implies Nd/Zr ratios of 0.84 and 0.91 for previously reported
air-grown crystals with lattice parameters of 10.627 ˚A [13, 24]
and 10.651 ˚A [18, 23], respectively. We note that these previ-
ously reported values may be anomalously low due to variance
in the Nd/Zr stoichiometry across a crystal boule, particularly
if only a small portion of the crystals were analyzed. It is pos-
sible that the average lattice parameters are closer to the value
of 10.662 ˚A observed in our air grown crystal.

The X-ray/neutron co-reﬁnement results (Table I) provide
clariﬁcation about the nature of this cation site disorder. When
Zr is allowed to reﬁne on the A-site, the reﬁned value in both
samples reached the maximum value of 1 minus the ﬁxed Nd

shows that this Zr excess is accommodated by occupation of
the depleted Nd sublattice by Zr. We note that in the py-
rochlore literature the reverse of this defect (occupation of the
B-site by the A-site ion) is referred to as “stufﬁng” and has
been studied extensively (see, for example, [34, 35, 43]). The
situation here, termed “negative” stufﬁng, has been the subject
of considerably fewer studies [47–49].

The results from the two lattice parameter model are also
consistent with the relationship between Nd/Zr ratio and lat-
tice parameter derived from laboratory XRD. The HP-Ar sam-
ple, where EPMA indicates Nd/Zr close to 1, favors the high
lattice parameter phase (aH = 10.665 ˚A, WH = 64 mass %)
while the air-grown sample, where EPMA indicates Nd/Zr <
1, favors the low lattice parameter phase (aL = 10.651 ˚A, WL
= 59 mass %). The increased variation seen across the larger
length scales of the EPMA line scans (Fig. 4(c,d)) suggests
that, across a boule, there exists a continuous distribution of
lattice parameters, rather than just two, which maps to the lo-
cal Nd/Zr ratio. This likely explains why the observed set of
lattice parameters is not the same between the two samples.
The shift in the reﬁned lattice parameters and weight fractions
represents a change in the average value of a continous lat-
tice parameter distribution. This, in turn, reﬂects the change
in the average stoichiometry. A higher level of disorder in the
air-grown sample is also indicated by the higher ADP values
for all sites. The A-site shows a particularly large increase (≈
43%), consistent with the increased amount of Zr occupation.

The neutron PDF data allows us to examine the possibility

of disorder within the local structure of Nd2(1−x)Zr2(1+x)O7
crystals, which can be distinct from the disorder found by
probing the average structure. Indeed, the poor ﬁt to the peak
in G(r) at r = 2.6 ˚A when reﬁning against the ideal pyrochlore
structure suggests the need for a local structural model that
goes beyond the variable position of the O1-site. The exis-
tence of a high-temperature disordered phase – the “defect
ﬂuorite” structure (space group number 225, Fm¯3m) – is well
known in the pyrochlore zirconates [2, 29, 46, 50]. This pro-
vides a likely explanation for the observed local disorder since
the anion sublattice of the defect ﬂuorite structure is related to
that of the pyrochlore structure by a disordering of the two
distinct oxygen positions (8b and 48f ), collapsing them to a
single position (8c).

The inclusion of the defect ﬂuorite phase only signiﬁ-
cantly affects RW in the r = 1.5 – 5 ˚A range, indicating that
the ﬂuorite “phase” is a very local disorder effect, which is
best described as follows:
the local environment of the Nd
and Zr cations resembles a mix of pyrochlore and ﬂuorite-
type oxygen coordination (though mostly dominated by the
pyrochlore-type), while the coordination of the average, crys-
tallographic structure is that of the ideal pyrochlore. This is
represented in Fig. 2 as occupation of the oxygen 8a inter-
stitial which coordinates with the Zr (B) site. The change in
the geometry of oxygen coordination (which forms a perfect
cube for both sublattices in the ﬂuorite case) is not illustrated.
Based on the existing evidence for local disorder in polycrys-
talline samples [29, 30], this defect ﬂuorite character is most

likely endemic to all FZ-grown samples, regardless of growth
parameters.

Having demonstrated the relationship between lattice pa-
rameter, Nd/Zr ratio, and growth pressure, we now turn to the
impacts of defect modes on the magnetic properties. Con-
sidering the χ(T ) data for the HP-Ar grown sample, the
qualitative aspects of the Curie-Weiss analysis are unaffected
by the decrease in disorder, relative to air-grown samples
[16, 23, 24]. The ΘCW remains small and positive, sug-
gesting that the balance between the FM dipolar interactions
and AFM superexchange interactions is not greatly modiﬁed.
Furthermore, the effective moment in this sample (µef f =
2.60 µB/Nd) remains reduced relative to the expected free-ion
value for Nd3+ moments (3.62 µB/Nd). However, this µef f
value is ≈ 5% larger than that of a previous report which used
the same Curie-Weiss procedure for an air-grown sample [18].
As indicated in Fig. 7, Msat for the HP-Ar sample is also en-
hanced relative to air-grown samples [18, 24]. These results
are all consistent with an increase in the amount of magnetic
Nd3+ present in crystals grown under a high-pressure Ar en-
vironment.

The low-temperature CP (T) data also evince changes in the
magnetism. Within our set of samples, the CP (T) data show
TAF M increases in tandem with the average lattice parame-
ter (Fig. 9, inset), reaching 355 mK for the HP-Ar sample.
The measurement of TAF M by single crystal neutron scatter-
ing (Fig. 10(a)) – which probes a much larger sample vol-
ume than the CP (T) data – shows that the intensity on the
(220) reﬂection increases below 365 mK, consistent with the
CP (T) data given the lower density of temperatures sampled.
These values remain slightly reduced relative to powder sam-
ples (TAF M = 370 – 390 mK [15, 16]), which can likely be at-
tributed to the distribution of Nd/Zr ratios present in the sam-
ple.
In comparison, previously reported, air-grown crystals
also yield reduced TAF M values of 285 mK [19] and 310 mK
[17]. These results show that the onset of long-range mag-
netic order is sensitive to the amount of structural disorder,
which primarily manifests as a variation in the extent of neg-
ative stufﬁng. In contrast, the local disorder detected in the
neutron PDF data does not appear to be a major factor in re-
ducing TAF M , as the fraction of defect ﬂuorite coordination
is comparable for the HP-Ar and the HP-80:20 samples.

Low defect concentrations can have outsized effects on the
magnetism of frustrated systems because the ground state se-
lection is often determined by a ﬁnely tuned balance of dif-
ferent interactions. Yb2Ti2O7 provides a particularly striking
example, where varying levels of disorder, consisting of O va-
cancies and/or (“positive”) stufﬁng, was determined to be re-
sponsible for the variety of observed ground states [34, 35]. In
the present case, there is no signature of scattering intensities
being redistributed away from the expected wave vectors of
AIAO order, and the AIAO state in Nd2Zr2O7 appears robust
across an appreciable range of disorder/defect densities.

Instead, more quantitative modiﬁcations to the ordered
state, such as the increased TAF M in the HP-Ar sample, can
be well understood by a reduction in the amount of negative
stufﬁng. The presence of non-magnetic Zr4+ on the A-site
breaks up the Nd3+ superexchange network, which weakens

10

the overall exchange interaction. This can be contrasted with
disorder in Yb2Ti2O7 where stufﬁng occurs via Yb3+ occu-
pying the B-site [34, 35, 43]. In that case, stufﬁng provides an
avenue for new magnetic exchange pathways and can quali-
tatively modify spin correlations, even at low defect densities
[34, 35]. That this does not happen in the case of Nd2Zr2O7
is rationalized by the different type of stufﬁng.

We turn now to the diffuse scattering at T = 38 mK (i.e. T
< TAF M ) observed for the HP-Ar crystal (Fig. 10(b). While
the appearance of the pinch-point pattern is unaffected by the
reduction in disorder, the temperature evolution appears mod-
iﬁed relative to earlier studies on air-grown samples. Previ-
ous reports have shown that the intensity is comparable at low
temperature (60 mK) and 450 mK, with a slight peak near
TAF M and a large reduction by 750 mK [13]. Estimation of
the magnetic moment which produces the pinch-point pattern
follows a qualitatively similar trend [38]. Although we do not
have the data to comment on the peak at TAF M , the pinch-
point pattern in our sample persists nearly unchanged up to
800 mK (the highest temperature measured). This is shown
by the integration presented in Fig. 10(a), where the values
at 500 mK and 800 mK are almost identical. Direct compar-
ison of the diffuse scattering heat maps (not shown) conﬁrms
this conclusion. Based on the fact that the pinch-point pattern
intensity is substantially weakened by ≈ 750 mK in an air-
grown sample [13] and remains robust at 800 mK in a HP-Ar
sample with ≈ 1 % negative stufﬁng, the spin-ice correlations
seem sensitive to this degree of disorder. A recent report sug-
gests that a separate spin-ice-like state may exist above TAF M
[38]; however our current data are unable to address this pos-
sibility.

The main temperature-induced change in the diffuse scat-
tering above TAF M in HP-Ar grown crystals lies in the region
between the arms of the pinch-point pattern, where intensity
coalesces around the (113) and (220)-type reﬂections as the
temperature is lowered from 800 to 500 mK (Fig. 10(c)).
Two possible origins for this diffuse scattering present them-
selves: 1) The onset of short-range, AIAO correlations and/or
2) scattering by monopole creation or hopping [20]. We can-
not directly address the latter possibility since evidence for
monopole dynamics comes in the form of a gapped contin-
uum of excitations and our measurement is energy-integrated.
However, assuming the former possibility, our analysis indi-
cates an AIAO correlation length of 55 ± 10 ˚A at 500 mK.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Using a combination of EPMA and X-ray/neutron scatter-
ing we have demonstrated that the reduced lattice parameter of
air-grown Nd2Zr2O7 single-crystals is due to negative stuff-
ing (i.e. occupation of the A-site by Zr). This occurs during
FZ-growth due to preferential evaporation of Nd2O3, which
we ﬁnd can be largely mitigated by a 70 bar Ar overpressure.
Neutron total scatting measurements also demonstrate the oc-
currence of a highly local form of disorder on the oxygen
sublattice, which is only somewhat reduced via high-pressure
growth. The HP-Ar grown crystals possess an optimized Nd

stoichiometry with a lattice parameter approaching the poly-
crystalline value and a negative stufﬁng level of ≈ 1%. How-
ever, this reduction in disorder does not qualitatively modify
the underlying physics responsible for the signatures of mag-
netic moment fragmentation. Instead, the reduction in disor-
der raises the temperature range over which the AIAO order
and, potentially, the diffuse pinch-point scattering are stabi-
lized. Our results provide an important experimental demon-
stration of the relationship between synthesis environment,
structural disorder, and magnetism in Nd2Zr2O7.
