ABSTRACT
In this article, we present the application of the weighted horizontal gradient of magnetic ﬁeld (WGM) ﬂare prediction method
to 3-dimensional (3D) extrapolated magnetic conﬁgurations of 13 ﬂaring solar active regions (ARs). The main aim is to identify
an optimal height range, if any, in the interface region between the photosphere and lower corona, where the ﬂare onset time
prediction capability of WGM is best exploited. The optimal height is where ﬂare prediction, by means of the WGM method,
is achieved earlier than at the photospheric level. 3D magnetic structures, based on potential and non-linear force-free ﬁeld
extrapolations, are constructed to study a vertical range from the photosphere up to the low corona with a 45 km step size. The
WGM method is applied as a function of height to all 13 ﬂaring AR cases that are subject to certain selection criteria. We found
that applying the WGM method between 1000 and 1800 km above the solar surface would improve the prediction of the ﬂare
onset time by around 2-8 hours.Certain caveats and an outlook for future work along these lines are also discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

The short-term (i.e., hours to days) interaction of solar ac-
tivity manifestations with geospace occurs through a com-
plex series of events, commonly referred to as Space Weather
(SW). Solar activity contributing to SW generally falls under
one of four major components: solar ﬂares, coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), high-speed solar wind and solar ener-
getic particles. From these occurrences, two most prominent
ones are, arguably, solar ﬂares and CME eruptions (Schwenn
2006). Earth is always impacted by Earth-facing solar ﬂares,
with impacts increasing with ﬂare size. Major ﬂares can gen-
erate long-lasting radiation storms in the Earth’s upper atmo-
sphere causing serious radio or data communication black-
outs, amongst other damaging eﬀects. Flares of larger GOES
classes are more frequently associated with CMEs (see, for
example, Yashiro et al. 2005).

CMEs, however, can be even more hazardous than ﬂares.
They are large clouds of magnetised plasma that may plow

robertus@sheﬃeld.ac.uk

right through the Sun-Earth interplanetary space at high
speeds. The impact of CMEs on Earth’s magnetosphere can
inﬂuence or even damage a number of socio-economically
vital ground-based (e.g. long-distance oil or gas pipelines,
electric power networks) and space-borne (satellites for com-
munication, navigation (GPS, ISS,...) infrastructures (East-
wood et al. 2017). Many of these societal assets and ser-
vices are key to the global economy, security and wellbe-
ing. Considerable infrastructure failures by CMEs have in-
the March 1989 electrical
deed happened in the past (e.g.
power blackout in Quebec, Canada). The largest known and
potentially most dangerous solar eruption in recent history
avoided Earth by only ∼30 degrees in 2012 (Temmer & Nitta
2015).

The frequency of occurrence of these most energetic erup-
tions in the entire Solar System follows the 11-year solar cy-
cle. At the peak of the cycle, intense ﬂares and powerful
CMEs occur frequently (i.e. around 2-3 daily). It is widely
accepted that major solar eruptions (i.e., ﬂares and CMEs, or
eruptive ﬂares) originate mostly from magnetically complex,
highly twisted and sheared elements of an active region (AR),
typically around sunspot groups with mixed magnetic polar-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ities (called δ-sunspots) (e.g. Toriumi & Wang 2019; Geor-
goulis et al. 2019). A key direction of research in solar erup-
tive activity aims to understand the dynamics of δ-sunspots
preceding ﬂare and CME eruptions in order to predict these
eruptions within practical timescales, enabling protection of
our high-tech facilities and, of course, ourselves. Predicting
reliably and accurately these solar eruptions is a major scien-
tiﬁc endeavour on its own. The question is not “whether” but
“when” a potentially devastating ﬂare (or CME) may happen,
with adverse eﬀects on our technosphere.

There are a number of methods available in the literature
that rely on a range of predictive parameters of solar erup-
tions (see e.g. Barnes et al. 2016; Leka et al. 2019, and ref-
erences therein). Most ﬂare and CME forecast methods ap-
ply photospheric magnetic and Doppler data of ARs for fore-
casting. Some recent, pioneering approaches with various
degrees of success attempt to incorporate solar atmospheric
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data and /or use Machine Learn-
ing in order to improve forecasting accuracy (see e.g. Qah-
waji & Colak 2007; Bobra & Couvidat 2015; Florios et al.
2018; Kim et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019; Campi et al. 2019).
Detailed information on measuring, and the consequent mod-
elling, of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld structure of an AR would be
important to obtain more accurate insight into the pre-ﬂare
evolution locally in the solar atmosphere. However, direct
routine observations of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld in the lower
solar atmosphere, above the photosphere up into the top of
the chromosphere, are currently not available, with an over-
whelming majority of observations referring now to either
the line-of-sight (LOS) component or the full magnetic ﬁeld
vector in the photosphere. Nowadays, approximate methods
for modelling the local magnetic ﬁeld vector in the solar at-
mosphere include its construction using current free (poten-
tial, PF) or nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation
techniques. In practice, however, to construct an accurate and
reliable 3D magnetic ﬁeld structure of an AR from photo-
spheric measurements is still a challenging task with a num-
ber of caveats, see e.g. Wiegelmann & Sakurai (2012).

Another potentially insightful approach may be the nu-
merical simulation of AR from the sub-photosphere to their
emergence and evolution in the lower solar atmosphere. With
the aims of testing ﬂare prediction with simulated data, a
ﬂaring AR with δ-sunspots was modelled by Kors´os et al.
(2018a). They introduced and applied two ﬂare precursors,
part of the WGM method (Kors´os et al. 2019): one is related
to the “inverted V-shape” feature of the WGM proxy and the
other is obtained from the “U-shape” of the so-called distance
parameter prior to each investigated ﬂare at a certain height
range in the solar atmosphere. Kors´os et al. (2018a) fur-
ther conjectured the existence of the so-called optimal height,
where the “U-shape” manifests itself earlier and reaches its
minimum value earlier than in the photosphere. In their mod-
elling study it was also shown that these optimal heights
agreed reasonably well with the heights of ﬂare occurrence

identiﬁed by an analysis of thermal and Ohmic heating sig-
natures enabled by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simu-
lations of Kors´os et al. (2018a). Next, for NOAA AR 11429,
Kors´os et al. (2018b) used PF extrapolation to construct the
3D magnetic ﬁeld above the photosphere and studied the pre-
ﬂare evolution of this AR prior to two M-class ﬂares. There,
it was found again, that the earliest onset time estimation was
enabled at a distinct and speciﬁc height range, i.e. at an opti-
mal height, when compared to patterns derived from data in
the photosphere or other atmospheric heights.

The two above-mentioned studies prompt us to attempt
to further establish the details of the conjectured wide ap-
plicability and beneﬁts of 3D pre-ﬂare analyses using a
larger sample of ﬂaring ARs and seeking the relevant opti-
mal height(s) with better statistical signiﬁcance. This work
is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the adopted tools
for the pre-ﬂare analysis of a given 3D solar magnetic struc-
ture. Section 3 introduces and describes the application of
the WGM to the lower solar atmosphere before the ﬂare oc-
currences. Section 4 discusses our results in detail. We sum-
marise our key ﬁndings and draw our conclusions in Sec-
tion 5. The Appendix contains more cases that support the
analysis presented in the main body of the work.

2. METHODOLOGY

Motivated by the case studies of Kors´os et al. (2018a,b),
we now extend the application of the WGM method to more
ARs by constructing a data catalogue of sunspots using 3D
PF and NLFFF extrapolations. An extrapolation example
from the collected data catalogue is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Three-dimensional NLFFF extrapolation of AR 11158 at
20:48:00 on 14/02/2011. The red-blue colour bar refers to the pos-
itive and negative polarity magnetic ﬁeld values at diﬀerent heights
in the solar atmosphere. The grey colour bar represents the photo-
spheric vertical magnetic ﬁeld component, Bz. The three horizontal
slices represent the identiﬁed sunspot at various heights in the lower
solar atmosphere.

With extrapolations accomplished, the WGM method is ap-
plied to the 3D PF and NLFFF extrapolated data. The WGM
method is then applied to both data sets and the results are

compared.

It is clear that each of the two extrapolation types, PF and
NLFFF, has its strengths and weaknesses: the NLFFF is most
likely a much better reconstruction method of the magnetic
ﬁeld in the lower solar atmosphere of an AR than the PF, it is
considerably more expensive computationally. Hence, if the
advantage in using NLFFF against PF toward improving the
lead time for ﬂare onset prediction is trivial, one might opt to
save computing time by using the PF approximation instead
of the NLFFF one.

2.1. Selection of studied ARs

Before we initiate the 3D analysis of the pre-ﬂare dynamics
of ARs with the WGM method, a consistent dataset of ARs is
required. The data processing and the PF/NLFFF magnetic
ﬁeld extrapolations of ARs were carried out with the exten-
sive use of SolarSoft1, with purpose- and instrument-speciﬁc
routines. For an AR to be included in the analysis, the fol-
lowing four selection criteria are set to be satisﬁed:

1. The studied AR is located between −60◦ and +60◦ in
central meridian distance during the examined period
of time.

2. The AR hosted a GOES X-class ﬂare. This is dictated
by practical, computational reasons and can be revis-
ited when suﬃcient resources are available.

3. The easternmost central meridian distance of X-ﬂaring

locations is not more than ∼ −40◦.

4. The AR had at least one δ-spot(s).

Over Solar Cycle 24, 13 ARs were found to satisfy the

above four selection criteria.

2.2. 3D lower atmospheric magnetic ﬁeld of ARs

Both the PF and the NLFFF extrapolations require pho-
tospheric boundary conditions. We employed the Solar
Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) LOS magnetograms as bound-
ary condition for the PF extrapolation. For the NLFFF, the
vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements of HMI Active Region
Patches (HARP) (Bobra et al. 2014) are used as a boundary
condition. In this work, the magnetogram data were studied
every hour and were resized by a factor of 8 thus giving rise
to photospheric magnetograms with a pixel size of 4 arcsec.

2.2.1. PF extrapolation

To determine the magnetic ﬁeld above the photosphere
with the PF extrapolation method, we employed the linear
force free ﬁeld (LFFF) IDL extrapolation code (see www.

1 http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/surf/sswdoc/solarsoft/ssw install howto.html

heliodocs.com), that is based on Gary (1989), where we
set the force-free parameter (α) equal to zero.

In brief, the PF is the simplest possible assumption for the
solar atmospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The LOS magnetograph is
used as boundary condition to solve Laplace’s equation,

∇2φ = 0,

(1)

where φ is the associated scalar potential for the PF.

2.2.2. NLFFF extrapolation

We apply the direct boundary integral formulation for non-
linear force-free magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation as outlined by
Yan & Li (2006). The predecessor of the NLFFF extrapo-
lation used here is the so-called boundary integral method,
ﬁrst developed by Yan & Sakurai (2000), and recently imple-
mented with GPU-acceleration by Wang et al. (2013).

The method uses the Green’s function to reformulate the
NLFFF problem. The obtained nonlinear integral equations
allow the independent calculation of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
at any location of the extrapolation volume. The method con-
siders the half-space above the lower boundary with vanish-
ing magnetic ﬁeld at inﬁnity. The solution at a given point i
inside the volume V for the boundary magnetic ﬁeld values
(B0) on Γ = ∂V, is given by:

with ci=1 for points in the volume and ci=1/2 for boundary
points. Y, in Eq. (2), is a kernel function which depends on
B (see for more details the Eq. (19) in Yan & Sakurai 2000).

2.3. Catalogue

We tracked “sunspots” above their photospheric altitudes
using the Yet Another Feature Tracking Algorithm (YAFTA;
Welsch & Longcope 2003; DeForest et al. 2007). YAFTA is
accessible from the Solarsoft IDL library. The detection al-
gorithm is based on the so-called clumping method, which
enrols together all contiguous-like-polarity pixels with ab-
solute ﬂux densities above a speciﬁed threshold, and marks
them as unique element. In our study, YAFTA is grouping
pixels into an element (such as a sunspot) when the given
criteria are satisﬁed: i) minimum number of pixels is 30 and
ii) local vertical magnetic ﬁelds exceed a |150| G threshold.
The magnetic ﬁeld strength, area, and cross-sectional di-
ameter of all identiﬁed sunspots of ARs are then recorded for
each relevant frame and saved in the sunspot data catalogue.
The generated 3D catalogue includes the area, mean mag-
netic ﬁeld and location (Carrington coordinates, L and B) of
identiﬁed sunspots using a 45 km step above the photosphere
toward the lower corona. The 45 km step size was chosen as
the highest vertical resolution, i.e. smallest grid size, imple-
mented in the NLFFF extrapolations.

2.4. Identiﬁcation of δ-spot of an AR

Before we begin to apply the WGM method, we need to
identify the δ-spot(s) of the selected ARs. Here, we adopt
and employ the automatic PIL recognition algorithm devel-
oped by Cui et al. (2006). The program ﬁrst computes the
horizontal component of the PF. Next, the pixels are selected,
based on whether the strength of the deduced transverse com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld is higher than |150| G. Also, the
pixels are identiﬁed where the horizontal gradient of the lon-
gitudinal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is larger than |50|
G/Mm. In the example given in Fig. 2, the contoured area
with PIL(s) corresponds to the δ-spots in the region, where
we apply the WGM method.

AR11158 on 14/02/2011 at 20:48:00. The red dotted lines are the
automatically identiﬁed PILs of the AR. White contours deﬁne areas
that enclose the identiﬁed strong ﬂux elements.

3. ANALYSIS OF PRE-FLARE BEHAVIOUR BASED ON

EXTRAPOLATION DATA

Through the case of AR 11158 with an X2.2 ﬂare at 01:56
on 15/02/2011, let us now demonstrate the application of the
WGM method as a function of height, applying it to PF and
NLFFF extrapolations. AR 11158 has two δ-spots, labelled
as the 1st and 2nd δ-spots, see in Fig. 2.

For both of the PF and NLFFF extrapolation results, let us
now track the evolution of (i) the WGM proxy, (ii) the Dpn
distance between the area-weighted barycenters of opposite
polarities and (iii) the unsigned magnetic ﬂux Φ in the 1st
and 2nd δ-spots at consecutive 45 km steps in height (z). To
identify the “inverted V-” and “U-shape” pre-ﬂare features,
we use the maximum and minimum values of the best nth
degree polynomial ﬁt to the WGM and Dpn data, respectively.
We, hereafter, focus on those atmospheric heights, where
the “inverted V-” and “U-shape” are identiﬁable prior to the
X2.2 ﬂare, for both δ-spot cases. For NOAA AR 11158 we
have found the following:

• In the case of the 1st δ-spot, the “inverted V-shape”
of the WGM and the “U-shape” of the Dpn are not dis-

cernible in the two extrapolation cases (see e.g. in App.
Fig. A1a-b).

• In the case of the 2nd δ-spot, the “inverted V-” and
“U-shape” each are observed prior to the X2.2 ﬂare
in both extrapolation cases (e.g. see Figs. A2-A3 a-b).
These two pre-ﬂare behaviours concurrently manifest,
from the photosphere up to 3000 km in the low corona.
Also, this δ-spot was the actual major source region of
the X2.2 ﬂare (e.g. Wang et al. 2012).

After, the relevant “inverted V-” and “U-shape” are suc-
cessfully identiﬁed at a given height, we carry on investigat-
ing their evolution as function of height. In particular, based
on Kors´os et al. (2018a,b), we concentrate on the starting
(ﬁrst orange dots in Figures A1– A3) and ﬁnishing (ﬁrst blue
dots in Figs. A1- A3) moments of the converging phase of
the “U-shape” illustrated at various heights/cases, because,
the elapsed time between these two moments provides in-
formation about the expected ﬂare onset time (see for more
details Fig. 5 of Kors´os et al. 2019).

Figure 3 shows the starting time (DMax

pn , point and diamond
symbols) and ﬁnishing time (DMin
pn , plus and square symbols)
of the converging phase at each 45 km step in the two δ-
spot cases. The point/plus symbols represent the data derived
from the PF extrapolation and the diamond/square symbols
indicate the results of the NLFFF extrapolation for the con-
structed 3D lower atmospheric magnetic ﬁelds of AR 11158.
The colour code corresponds to the actual value of the Dpn.
Also, the red line marks the onset time of the X2.2 ﬂare in
AR 11158. We notice that the converging phase begins ear-
lier and reaches its minimum distance also earlier at a cer-
tain height (referred to as the optimal height) than it does at
the photosphere, as also found in Kors´os et al. (2018a,b).

Identifying the corresponding optimal heights, we estimate
the expected largest ﬂare intensity class (S f lare) and onset
time (Test), as in Kors´os et al. (2019), to investigate the ap-
plicability of WGM for 2nd δ-spot:

• In the PF case, the optimal height is 1395 km because
the converging phase (the max point of the ﬁtted nth
order polynomial) started 1.2 hrs before and ﬁnished 2
hrs earlier than in the photosphere, enabling the maxi-
mum lead time prior to ﬂare onset as function of solar
atmospheric height.

• In the NLFFF case, the converging phase began 0.9 hrs
before and ﬁnished 0.7 hrs earlier at best, at 810 km.

Therefore, with the PF approximation one can estimate the
expected ﬂare onset time 1.3 hr earlier than in the case of
NLFFF. It also worth noting that Test is very close to the ac-
tual values of TD+F in the case of NLFFF. At these two op-
timal heights, the S f lare of the investigated ﬂare are found to
be fairly well estimated, i.e.
the expected ﬂare intensity is
determined as an X-class ﬂare (see Table B1).

lations are shown by point/plus and diamond/square symbols, re-
spectively. The moments of starting and closest convergence times
are deduced by the maximum and minimum values, respectively, of
the best nth degree polynomial ﬁt to the Dpn data. The colour bar
gives information about the actual value of Dpn. Results from 2nd δ-
spot in the AR are shown.The red vertical line marks the X2.2 ﬂare
occurrence time that occurred from the 2nd δ-spot.

The above obtained two estimates (S f lare and Test) are
summarised in Table B1. Furthermore, Table B1 includes
information about the time prior to the ﬂare at the start (T C
lmp)
and closest (T M
lmp) convergence at the optimal height, for both
extrapolation approaches. T M
lmp can also be understood as the
lead-time at the corresponding optimal height, as we estimate
pn -DMax
the ﬂare onset time from DMin
pn . Actually, the values of
T M
Imp indicate how much time one could gain in the ﬂare onset
time estimation if one applies the WGM method at an identi-
ﬁed optimal height.

3.1. Additional results of PF vs. NLFFF

Here, we outline the results of investigating three addi-
tional ARs that demonstrate how to further improve the ﬂare
onset time prediction capability of the WGM method by
means of an optimal height analysis. For the detailed com-
parative analysis of ARs 11166, 11283 and AR 12192 see
Tables B1 in Appendix B. A visual summary of these results
is given in Fig. 4 .

In Fig. 4a, the columns show the gained time at end of the
converging phase (T M
Imp) at the optimal height. In Fig. 4b, the
columns represent the optimal height of the particular ﬂare
events. In Figures 4a and b, the grey/line-crossed columns

refer to PF/NLFFF extrapolations. The plotted values ex-
pressed in numbers are given in Table B1. The abscissas of
Figures 4a and b are labelled with the name of the AR that
hosted the ﬂare in the same order as the name of the ARs are
listed in Table B1.

From Fig. 4 and Table B1, we conclude that the optimal
heights and the lead time improvements are not identical for
the four studied ARs and ﬁve major ﬂare cases. We also
note that, interestingly, the PF has better T M
Imp improvement
in four cases out of ﬁve. Based on this ﬁnding, one might be
tempted to use PF in further studies, for computational eﬃ-
ciency. This might be changed in the future, of course, when
computational advances allow for the routine application of
NLFFF (or, indeed, even more sophisticated modelling) in
much shorter times.

4. APPLICATION OF PF TO MORE ACTIVE REGIONS

Let us now analyse 13 more ﬂaring AR cases (see Ta-
ble B2), which all satisfy the selection criteria given in
Sec. 2.1.

First, we constructed the 3D PF extrapolations and iden-
tiﬁed δ-spots. Next, the WGM method was applied to each
δ-spot as a function of height with steps of 45 km. The anal-
ysis of Section 3 were carried out to identify the relevant “in-
verted V-” and “U-shape” of the WGM and Dpn parameters.
Our ﬁndings are summarised in Fig. 5 and Table B2.

Similar to the ﬁrst four examples, we found again that the
evolution of the three parameters, i.e. WGM, Dpn and Φ, vary
as a function of height in all identiﬁed δ-spots. In all cases,
the converging phase began earlier and reached its shortest
distance also earlier at their respective optimal heights. Fur-
thermore, we note here that we could not identify the concur-
rent precursor presence of the “inverted V-” or “U-shape” in
the cases of non-ﬂaring δ-spots (see two random examples of
AR 11158 in Fig. A1a and AR 12297 in Fig. A6).

In regards to the 13 ﬂaring ARs studied, we ﬁnd that (i) the
lead time (T M
Imp) values range between ∼ 1 and 8 hours at the
identiﬁed optimal heights, and (ii) optimal heights seem to
fall under two distinct intervals, namely, ∼ 90 - 600 km and
∼ 1000 - 1800 km.

The estimated ﬂare onset times (Test) are much closer to
the actual values of TD+F at the optimal height of 1000-1800
km, even considering the 7.2 hr uncertainty. For the 90 - 600
km range, diﬀerences can be as large as 2 days between Test
and TD+F (see e.g. AR 11515, in Table B2).

Based on our ﬁndings above, there is a practically eﬀec-
tive optimal height range of 1000-1800 km, for which the
prediction capability of the WGM method is considerably im-
proved. In order to determine the potential lead time between
1000 and 1800 km, we use T M
Imp. This is a very important in-
formation because estimating the onset time of a ﬂare seems
to rely on the linear relationship between the converging and
diverging motions of the opposite polarities (see Fig. 5a of
Kors´os et al. 2019). Therefore, as a summary we conclude

that, based on the values of T M
Imp in Tables B1–B2, we could
estimate the ﬂare onset times ∼2-8 hrs earlier with the WGM
method at an altitude range of ∼1000 - 1800 km above the
photosphere using the PF method, rather than working on the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we applied the WGM method at diﬀerent
heights between the photosphere and the low corona to 3D
magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations of ARs containing δ-spots at
their observed photospheric base, in order to identify an op-
timal height range where ﬂare prediction could be achieved
earlier than using only photospheric data. Our aims were
realised by (i) implementing potential (PF) and non-linear
magnetic ﬁeld (NLFFF) exploration techniques and (ii) cre-
ating a sample of 3D magnetic maps of sunspots in the lower
solar atmosphere.

As in our previous works, we considered two unique pre-
ﬂare patterns of the WGM method (namely, the “inverted V-

shape” of the WGM proxy and the “U-shape” of the distance
(Dpn) parameter) as a function of height, instead of study-
ing the otherwise popular quantity of the free energy of ARs.
We still do not have a detailed physical explanation to cap-
ture the two pre- ﬂare patterns. However, we put forward our
conjecture in Section 4 of Kors´os et al. (2019). Namely, that
a current sheet develops during the convergence phase of the
two opposite-polarity area-weighed barycenters, while mag-
netic reconnection takes place after the end of the divergence
phase. The validation of this conjecture should be conﬁrmed
by 3D numerical simulations but that is beyond the scope of
this work. An alternative suggestion was put forward by Tla-
tov et al. (2018), for more details see Fig. 5 of their paper.

In this study, we compared the results obtained by applying
the WGM method to PF and NLFFF extrapolation data in four
diﬀerent ﬂaring ARs. We discovered that, at a certain height,
called the optimal height, the ﬁtted “U-shapes” enabled us to
estimate the expected ﬂare onset time earlier than using only
magnetic data at the photospheric level. This is a key ﬁnding
of this work.

We also observed that the identiﬁed optimal heights and
lead-time improvements for estimating the ﬂare onset time
vary with the applied extrapolation method. Namely, we
found that sometimes the yielded lead-time by PF is better by
up to a few hours than using NLFFF extrapolation. This is
another important practical aspect because the CPU running
time diﬀerences between the PF and NLFFF extrapolations
are substantial. It might be prohibiting to apply the WGM
method under the NLFFF extrapolation in near-realtime due
to computational limitations, but the PF extrapolation may
oﬀer a viable alternative.

Next, we restricted to PF extrapolations only. We found
that the potential lead-time improvement for estimating the
ﬂare onset time varies in the interval (2, 8) hours if we apply
the WGM method to an identiﬁed “sunspot” between ∼1000
and 1800 km above the photosphere.

In this study, we do not have a negative sample (i.e., non-
ﬂaring ARs with δ-spots), because ARs that form δ-spots
tend to be ﬂaring (e.g. Toriumi & Wang 2019; Georgoulis
et al. 2019, and references therein). It seems that there are
δ-spots in some of the ARs studied, here, which do not show
the “ inverted V-” and “U”-shapes though. In the future, we
will also extend this work in at least two directions: i) carry
out magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations and use the WGM method
to determine the evolution of the non-ﬂaring and ﬂaring δ-
sunspots with ﬂares of lower GOES class (e.g. M-, and even
C-classes); and ii) test the ﬁndings of this work, as well as the
ﬂare precursor capability of the WGM method, with a larger

statistical sample of ARs. We will also investigate, for near-
realtime operational purposes, the time needed to determine
whether a given Dpn is indeed the minimum and how this
time relates to the estimated and actual onset time.

A. APPLICATION OF THE WGM-METHOD AT DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERIC HEIGHTS

A.1. AR 11158
Figures A1-A3 show the evolution of WGM, Dpn and Φ before the X2.2 ﬂare, which occurred at 01:56 on 15/02/2011 in AR
11158. Panels (a) and (b) of each ﬁgure reveal the evolution of the various pre-ﬂare indicators, applied to the PF and NLFFF
extrapolations. The upper panels in each ﬁgure are the temporal variations of WGM. The pre-ﬂare behavior of WGM is ﬁtted by an
nth-order polynomial (red line), where the orange dot corresponds to the maximum of WGM. The middle panels demonstrate the
evolution of Dpn. The consecutive maximum-minimum-maximum (orange-blue-orange dots) locations of the ﬁtted nth-degree
polynomial denote the full converging-diverging phase uncovered by Dpn. The vertical blue stripes mark the ﬂare peak time. The
bottom panels show the evolution of the unsigned magnetic ﬂux (Φ).

To ﬁnd the best nth-order polynomial, we ﬁt the data with a range of polynomial degrees and pick the degree that has the lowest

root mean square error.

Figures A1-A2 show the evolution of WGM, Dpn and Φ at the photospheric level in the case of 1st and 2nd δ-spots of AR 11158.
Furthermore, Fig. A3 (a)-(b) correspond to ﬁndings obtained at the identiﬁed optimum heights in the case of PF an NLFFF
analyses of 2nd δ-spot, respectively.

features, we use the maximum (orange dots) and minimum (blue dots) values of the best nth degree polynomial ﬁt (red dashed line) to the WGM
data and to the Dpn data. The blue shaded vertical line marks the X2.2 ﬂare occurrence time. This 2nd δ-spot was the host of X2.2 ﬂare.

Figure A3. Same as Fig. A2 for AR 11158 where panels (a) and (b) now illustrate the evolution of the ﬂare precursor parameters at the optimal
height. (a): The optimal height is 1395 km above the photosphere in the PF case. (b): The optimal height is 810 km from the photosphere in
the NLFFF case.

A.2. AR 12297
The AR 12297 was host of an X2.1 ﬂare at 16:22 on 11/03/2015. This AR has two δ-spots determined by the method of Cui et
al. (2006), labelled as the 1st and 2nd δ-spots, respectively, in Fig. A4. Figures A5-A6 show the temporal variation of WGM, Dpn
and Φ at the photosphere (Panel a); and 500 km above the solar surface (Panel b), applied to the PF magnetic extrapolation data.
Panels (a) and (b) of Figures A5 reveal the evolution of “inverted V-” and “U-shape” of the WGM and Dpn parameters before
X2.1 ﬂare, in case of the 1st δ-spot. Note, in Fig. A6, we cannot identify the “inverted V-” and “U-shape” before the X2.1 in the
case of 2nd δ-spot. The reason is because actually the 1st δ-spot was the source of the X2.1 ﬂare (Lu et al. 2019).

B. BRIEF COMPARISON ANALYSES OF PRE-FLARE BEHAVIOUR OF FURTHER THREE ACTIVE REGIONS BASED

ON PF AND NLFFF EXTRAPOLATIONS

B.1. AR 11166

The second example is AR 11166. Here, we investigate the pre-ﬂare states before an X1.5 ﬂare. This ﬂare occurred in the
single δ-spot of the AR at 23:23 on 09/03/2011 (Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014). We could identify the prominent and typical
“inverted V” and “U” shapes prior to X1.5 in the vertical region from the photosphere up to 2000 km at each 45 km step. In the
NLFFF extrapolation case, we further noticed that two consecutive precursors of the WGM and the Dpn appear instead of one
only above 500 km. Therefore, we can uniquely identify the optimal height only in the case of the ﬁrst modelling approach. In
the second case, we do not have photospheric reference data (see Fig. B7). In the PF case, the optimal height is identiﬁed at
1080 km where the converging phase started (T C
Imp) 0.6 hrs earlier and ended (T M
Imp) 4.6 hrs earlier than in the photosphere. In the
NLFFF case, T C
Imp is 0.5 hrs and T M
Imp is 2.9 hrs corresponding to an optimal height of 315 km. Here, we could estimate the ﬂare
onset time a couple of hours earlier using either of the extrapolations. Unfortunately, Test seems to be rather overestimated, with
8 hrs, in the PF extrapolation case. However, the Test value is well in agreement with the TD+F value when applying data from
the corresponding NLFFF extrapolation. In the PF case, using Eq. of Fig. 5 of Kors´os et al. (2019), we estimated the S f lare as an
M-class that is an underestimate when compared to the measured X1.5 ﬂare intensity. In the NLFFF case, S f lare is found to be
correctly.

B.2. AR 11283
The next example is AR 11283 with a ﬂare of X1.8 that occurred at 22:20 on 06/09/2011 and with another one of X2.1 at 22:38
on 07/09/2011. These two ﬂares had their cradle in the same δ-spot of the AR (Liu et al. 2014). Here, the characteristic pre-ﬂare
behavior of the WGM and the Dpn are evaluated, using the appropriate 3D constructed magnetic ﬁeld structures, where both
precursor patterns are identiﬁable prior to each of the two ﬂares. We found that the two ﬂare precursor behaviours of the X1.8
ﬂare disappear from 1000 km upwards in both of the PF and NLFFF extrapolation modelling. For the X1.8 ﬂare, the optimal
Imp is 1.6/1.2 hrs and the
height of the PF is found to be at 90 km and for the NLFFF it is also at 90 km, where, the value of T C
value of T M

Imp is 2.1/1.5 hrs in the PF/NLFFF case, respectively.

For the X2.1 ﬂare, the optimal height is found to be 1035 km for PF magnetic ﬁeld structures of AR 11283. The converging
phase begun 6.7 hours beforehand and ﬁnished 7.3 hrs earlier at the optimum height 1035 km when compared to the result of
analysis applied to the data in the photosphere. The 1035 km was chosen for the PF as the optimum height because the beginning
and ﬁnishing moments of the converging phase started to shift continuously above this height until 3000 km (see Fig. B8 b).
Extrapolation was carried out only up to 3000 km. In the NLFFF case, the optimum height is found to be at 225 km, where, the
value of T C

Imp is 3.8 hrs and the value of T M

Imp is 1.8 hrs, respectively.

In summary, the overall situation with the estimates is similar to that of the AR 11166 in the PF case. Here, in both extrapolation

models, the Test values are underestimated for the X1.8 ﬂare while Test is overestimated for the X2.1 case, just like in the PF case
for AR 11166. S f lare are fairly well estimated. In the case of AR 11283, we could estimate the onset time of the X1.8 ﬂare 5.5
hrs earlier with the PF data when compared to the counterpart obtained with the NLFFF extrapolation. For predicting the X2.1
ﬂare, the PF and NLFFF extrapolations seem to be similarly beneﬁcial.

Figure B8. The plots (a) and (b) correspond two X-class ﬂares (X1.8 and X2.1 ﬂares) of AR 11283.

B.3. AR 12192

The last randomly selected example to demonstrate the prediction capability of the WGM method in a 3D lower solar atmo-
sphere model is AR 12192, with a series of ﬂares that occurred in the same δ-spot, according to Bamba et al. (2017). The ﬁrst
pair of characteristic pre-ﬂare behaviors of the WGM and Dpn are observed prior to the X1.6 ﬂare, which occured at 14:28 on
22/10/2014. However, the “U” shape starts to form when the AR is on ∼67◦, where the magnetic projection eﬀects are not
neglectable. Therefore, here, we did not investigate the case of X1.6 ﬂare.

Later, another pair of the “inverted V” and “U” shapes are found and evaluated prior to the X3.1 (at 21:41 on 24/10/2014)
and X1.0 (at 18:08 on 25/10/2014) ﬂares, respectively. In the cases of the X3.1 and X1.0 ﬂares, the optimal height of the PF
approach is at 1260 km, and, it is at 90 km for the NLFFF extrapolation. The lead times are very similar in the case of NLFFF
=2.1 hrs). Furthermore, in the case of NLFFF, the Test values is well estimated for the
(T M
Imp
ﬁrst ﬂare occurrence. The diﬀerence between the estimated and the actual occurrence times are close to the ± 7.2 hrs uncertainty.

=2.3 hrs) and PF approach (T M
Imp

We cannot say this about the case of PF extrapolation. Here, we also must mention that AR 12192 produced a further X2.0 ﬂare
at 10:56 26/10/2014. However, we can only observe the two typical pre-ﬂare patterns when using the PF data.

Figure B9. The plot corresponds to two X-class ﬂares (X3.1 and X1.0 ﬂares) of AR 12192.
