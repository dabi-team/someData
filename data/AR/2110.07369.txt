ABSTRACT

During the lifetime of AR 12673, its magnetic ﬁeld evolved drastically and produced numerous large ﬂares.
In this study, using full maps of the Sun observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory, we identiﬁed that AR 12673 emerged in decayed AR 12665, which had survived for two
solar rotations. Although both ARs emerged at the same location, they possessed different characteristics and
different ﬂare productivities. Therefore, it is important to study the long-term magnetic evolution of both ARs to
identify the distinguishing characteristics of an AR that can produce large solar ﬂares. We used the Spaceweather
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patch data to investigate the evolution of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld and other physical properties of the recurring ARs during ﬁve Carrington rotations. All these
investigated parameters dynamically evolved through a series of solar rotations. We compared the long-term
evolution of AR 12665 and AR 12673 to understand the differences in their ﬂare-producing properties. We also
studied the relation of the long-term evolution of these ARs with the presence of active longitude. We found
that the magnetic ﬂux and complexity of AR 12673 developed much faster than those of AR 12665. Our results
conﬁrmed that a strong emerging ﬂux that emerged in the pre-existing AR near the active longitude created a
very strong and complex AR that produced large ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION

Majority of the existing solar ﬂare prediction methods are dependent on short-term (several hours to days) physical prop-
erties of an active region (AR) and its ﬂaring history (Campi et al. 2019; Leka et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2019) although AR
lifetimes can reach up to 10 and 5 months during the solar minimum and maximum, respectively (Schrijver & Harvey 1994;
van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). During an AR lifetime, its magnetic ﬁeld properties determine the characteristics of its ﬂare
productivity and eruptivity. A previous study (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 1999) found that the long-lived AR 7978, which emerged
in the late phase of solar cycle 22, survived for several months, became ﬂare-rich in the ﬁrst three rotations itself, and remained
eruptive until the decay phase. Schrijver & Harvey (1994) found that the area of a bipole AR is proportional to the magnetic ﬂux
emerged in it during its lifetime. van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green (2015) showed that an AR lifetime is proportional to the amount
of magnetic ﬂux at its maximum development. Ugarte-Urra et al. (2015) found the lifetimes of several ARs to be continuously

proportional to the maximum 304 ˚A intensity. Recently, Iglesias et al. (2020) studied long-term evolution of a long-duration AR
in the early phase of solar cycle 24 and found that its characteristics varied signiﬁcantly during ﬁve solar rotations.

Several studies found the existence of a 25.5–27 day ﬂare periodicity and its harmonics in the Sun, which were attributed to
the solar rotation (Bai 2003a; Kilcik et al. 2010). The fundamental ≈27 days of periodicity can be considered as an indicator of
the existence of a long-lifetime sunspot or an AR that re-occurs in the Earth-side solar disk after one solar rotation. Furthermore,
many studies argued that there exist several locations in the Sun where sunspots tend to emerge repeatedly during one solar
cycle. The longitudes where sunspots or active regions are commonly observed over a long period are known as active longitudes
(Ivanov 2007; Gyenge et al. 2016). Because the active zones in the Sun do not pose a common longitude in the northern and
southern hemisphere, the term “hotspot” is sometimes preferred to be used (Bai 1990, 2003b). The presence of active longitudes
or hotspots might contribute to the periodicities of ﬂare activities (Gyenge et al. 2016).

Based on the analysis of sunspot area over solar cycle 12–23, it was found that the active longitudes were distributed at near
90◦, 180◦, and 270◦ of Carrington longitudes in the northern hemisphere, and at 90◦, 180◦, and 360◦ of Carrington longitudes in
the southern hemisphere (Ivanov 2007). It was also found that the width of the sunspot formation zone was approximately 20◦–
30◦ heliongitude and rigidly rotated with a Carrington period. This sunspot formation zone could survive for 15–20 rotations.
Moreover, previous studies revealed there were two active longitudes of sunspots that were roughly separated by 180 degrees over
a long period of time (Usoskin et al. 2005). The locations of active longitudes in both hemispheres were found to be asymmetry.
This asymmetry was probably related to the different rotation rates that were observed in the northern and southern hemispheres
(Usoskin et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2011).

Magnetic activity complex, where new magnetic ﬂux emerges in the pre-existing AR, was also often observed in the Sun over
multiple rotations (Bumba & Howard 1969; Gaizauskas et al. 1983). This newly emerging ﬂux in pre-existing AR could increase
the non-potentiality of new AR that led to the occurrences of solar ﬂares (Komm & Gosain 2015). Gyenge et al. (2016) found
ARs that were near active longitude had a higher probability to produce ﬂares than ARs that were far from active longitude.

Owing to the relation of ﬂare periodicities with solar rotation and active longitudes, the long-term (27 days) characteristics of
a ﬂaring AR may be useful for long-term ﬂare prediction and understanding the process in the interior of the Sun. Thus, it is
interesting to investigate whether the recent ﬂare prediction capability can be improved. However, the long-term evolution of
ﬂaring ARs having long lifetimes in solar cycle 24 have not been extensively studied yet, although many similar studies have
been conducted on ARs in past solar cycles. To explore this issue, we investigated the long evolution of an AR that produced
many ﬂares in solar cycle 24. We used AR 12673 as a representative of the ﬂaring AR owing to its rich ﬂaring history.

The X9.3 solar ﬂare which occurred on September 6, 2017 from AR NOAA 12673 was the most powerful ﬂare during solar
cycle 24. During the ﬂaring period from September 4 to September 10, 2017 many other large ﬂares and coronal mass ejec-
tions (CMEs) occurred from the same AR. Numerous severe impacts of these events on radio communications were reported
(Redmon et al. 2018). Because the energy and onset of a solar ﬂare are related to the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld of the AR,
it is particularly important to understand the ﬂare productivity of AR 12673 by studying its magnetic ﬁeld evolution over long
period.

Many studies have focused on understanding mechanism the energy build-up (Yang et al. 2017; Verma 2018; Liu et al. 2018)
and ﬂare trigger mechanism of AR 12673 that caused the numerous large ﬂares and CMEs (Yan et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018;
Inoue et al. 2018; Bamba et al. 2020). Analysis of photospheric magnetogram data and coronal nonlinear force-free ﬁeld
(NLFFF) extrapolations suggested that the large ﬂares and CMEs in this AR were generated by combined shearing motion,
sunspot rotation in the photosphere, and interaction of the magnetic ﬂux rope and the surrounding ﬁeld in the corona (Liu et al.
2018; Hou et al. 2018) due to some intrusion of the opposite ﬁeld in the vicinity of the polarity inversion line (PIL) (Bamba et al.
2020). Photospheric magnetogram data have clariﬁed that the highly dynamic in photosphere and sub-photosphere of AR 12673
caused a rapid helicity injection in the corona and was responsible for the eruptive ﬂares that occurred on September 6, 2017
(Vemareddy 2019; Moraitis et al. 2019). All the above studies focused on the time evolution of the AR several days prior and
after the X9.3 ﬂare occurrence. We proposed that it is also necessary to study the long-time evolution of this AR because of the
lack of clear evidence that previous ARs have been observed from the same region as that of AR 12673.

We traced the location of this AR for several rotations before and after it transited in the Earth-side solar disk. We found
several NOAA ARs that preceded and succeeded AR 12673 at the same location. The long-term recurrence of these ARs at the
same location allowed investigation of the long-term evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld. For clarity, in our paper, we have used the
terminology reoccurring AR to refer to a bundle of strong magnetic ﬂux regions that emerged at similar locations over multiple
solar rotations. A strong magnetic ﬂux region appeared in the Sun in a speciﬁc solar rotation and identiﬁed as an AR without
unique number assigned by the NOAA is called as AR NOAA (ARN).

LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF AR NOAA 12673

In this study, we aimed to show the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolution of a ﬂaring AR over multiple solar rotations. The
objective of this study was to understand the relation between ﬂaring AR 12673 and other ARs that were observed in the same
region in several solar rotations before and after the passage of AR 12673. Our main goal was to identify the characteristics of
the AR magnetic ﬁeld during its lifetime over several rotations and its relation with ﬂare activities. We wanted to know whether
the ﬂare periodicity can be used to improve the ﬂare prediction time. In this study, we only considered two ﬂaring ARNs as case
studies. Therefore, the results may not represent the general characteristics of a long-lived AR evolution in the Sun for solar cycle
24. Nevertheless, this investigation can contribute to the studies on the long-term evolution of the AR 12673 magnetic ﬁeld as
well as long-term ﬂare forecasting.

2. DATA AND METHODS

2.1. Data

Photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data were obtained using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory (SDO) that continuously measure the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld every 720 seconds (Schou et al.
2012). The inversion of the HMI Stokes I, Q, U, and V data are conducted by using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector
(VFISV) code, which assumes a Milne-Eddington model of the solar atmosphere (Borrero et al. 2011). The 180° ambiguity of
HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld is resolved using a minimum energy method (Metcalf 1994; Leka et al. 2009). The detailed pipeline
processing of HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld data is given by Hoeksema et al. (2014).

Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) is a derivative data product of HMI, which is released by
the HMI team (Bobra et al. 2014).
It automatically identiﬁes active region patches in HMI data and remaps the vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld data to a Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection (CEA) (Bobra et al. 2014). We used collec-
tions of magnetogram data series of SHARPs, which contained three vector magnetic ﬁeld components (Bφ, Bθ, Br)
the signal-to-noise ratio in the
(http://jsoc.stanford.edu/doc/data/hmi/sharp/sharp.htm). As shown by Bobra et al. (2014),
SHARPs parameters increases signiﬁcantly beyond +/- 70◦ of central meridian. Because of the limitations in using the SHARP
data for the location of an AR far from the disk center, we only used them during the passage of the ARs for four days of its
closest position to the disk center. Therefore, it should be noted that this constraint hinders the application of our results to the
condition of the AR at other longitudes.

Synoptic maps were acquired from the HMI magnetic ﬁeld synoptic charts for various Carrington rotations (CRs), which were
also available at the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC), Stanford University. We chose radial magnetic ﬁeld data for the CRs
2192–2196, as shown in Figure 1. The ﬂare histories and the magnetic classes were obtained from the Heliophysics Integrated
Observatory (https://helio-vo.eu) catalogue. We deﬁned the solar ﬂare histories only for the C-class or stronger ﬂares recorded
in the abovementioned catalogue. We also used GOES X-ray ﬂux data to study the periodicity of ﬂare occurrence in 2017. The
data were accessed from https://satdat.ngdc.noaa.gov/sem/goes/data/. We used a one-minute time resolution for the GOES-15
X-ray ﬂux, complemented by the GOES-13 data to compensate the unavailable data from July to November 2017. When no data
were recorded by the two satellites, we conducted a linear interpolation to ﬁll the gaps. Full-disk HMI solar magnetogram data
obtained from the Virtual Solar Observatory (https://sdac.virtualsolar.org/) were accessed and processed using Sunpy modules
(Community et al. 2015).

To identify the Carrington longitudes of the AR for several solar rotations, we estimated the coordinates of the AR by consid-
ering the differential rotation rate at the observed latitudes. The synodic rotation rate was calculated using formula (Sheeley et al.
1992):

2
ω(θ) = 13.46 − 2.7 cos

4
θ + 1.2 cos

6
θ − 3.2 cos

θ,

(1)

where θ is colatitude.

The Carrington longitudes of the ARNs in multiple rotations are listed in table 1. The estimated Carrington longitude was
calculated for every CR using the rotation rate at the corresponding colatitude when the ARN was near the central meridian as a
reference for the coordinate of the following CR. We compared the results from equation (1) with the Carrington coordinates of
the ARNs given by the Heliophysics Event Catalogue (https://helio-vo.eu/solar activity/arstats-archive/).

Data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument onboard the SDO and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI)
onboard the STEREO were used to trace the ARs from July to November 2017. By combining the observations from the
SDO/AIA at 193 ˚A and the STEREO-A/EUVI at 195 ˚A we produced a series of global maps of the Sun for ﬁve solar rotations.
However, STEREO-B could not observe the Sun since 2014; therefore, complete views of the Sun in the Earth and far sides were
impossible to obtain during this period. We traced AR 12665 from July 6 to November 3, 2017. First, we marked the location
of the centroid of the bright region in AR 12665 on July 6 on the map and deﬁned the location in the heliographic Stonyhurst
longitude and latitude. Subsequently, we tracked this bright region by predicting its future longitude. The traced region in the

4

fullmap of the Sun is shown as a red square in Figure 2. The prediction assumed that the bright region rotated at a certain rate.
Sharma et al. (2020) observed the rotation rate of the Sun in the AIA 193 ˚A wavelength at a low latitude (-10◦ S to 10◦ N) as
approximately 26–27◦/day. Note that this rotation rate is slower than that on the photosphere.

We calculated the magnetic potentials of the ARs from the radial components of the magnetic ﬁelds of SHARP data using the

Fourier method (Alissandrakis 1981). The magnetic potentials were calculated every step with a 3-hour time cadence.

Magnetic energy of the ARs were calculated as follows:

2.2. Magnetic Free Energy

where E is the energy, B is the magnetic ﬂux density, and V is the volume of the space over the AR.

Because information was only available from two-dimensional photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data, only the proxy of the volu-
metric magnetic energy can be directly calculated. The real free energy, Erf , of the AR in the photosphere can be deﬁned as

E =

However, using equation 3, a negative free energy density may be obtained because Bpot

2016). Therefore, instead of using equation 3 to express the energy evolution of the AR in the photosphere, we preferred to
calculate the nonpotential energy using the following formula:

where

Bs = Bob − Bpot.
Bs denotes the source ﬁeld obtained from the difference between the observed ﬁeld (Bob) and the potential ﬁeld (Bpot)
(Yang et al. 2012; Zhang 2016).

(5)

This source ﬁeld represents the nonpotentiality of the magnetic ﬁeld on the photosphere. It is noteworthy that these properties
were only calculated when the ARNs were located near the disk center. In this study, to evaluate the free energy evolution of
the ARs during multiple solar rotations, the free energy deﬁnition by Yang et al. (2012) as expressed in equation 4 was adopted.
Thus, the free energy, Ef , was derived as

Ef =

(6)

θs is the shear angle, which is the angle between the projected and potential vector magnetic ﬁelds on the photosphere. This
deﬁnition is highly convenient for obtaining the temporal magnetic ﬁeld evolution because it ensures a positive free energy
density.

To validate the calculation of the magnetic free energy on the photosphere, we compared the free energy calculated using
equation 6 with the volumetric free energy calculated using the NLFFF model. We employed the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
relaxation method by Inoue et al. (2014b) to extrapolate the NLFFF model of the AR. First, the three-dimensional (3-D) potential
ﬁeld of the AR was extrapolated using the Fourier method (Alissandrakis 1981) based on the radial components (Br) in the
vector magnetic ﬁeld data. Subsequently, the horizontal components (Bxp and Byp) on the bottom boundary of the potential
ﬁeld model were incrementally changed to the observed horizontal components (Bx and By). The induction equation was solved
iteratively until the bottom boundaries of the NLFFF satisﬁed the observed vector magnetic ﬁeld components. For the detailed
MHD relaxation method, see Inoue et al. (2014b).

This NLFFF method has been evaluated to reproduce magnetic ﬁeld of ideal force-free cases, i.e., Low and Lou solution,
with high accuracy (Inoue et al. 2014b). The method has been applied to produce NLFFFs of many famous ARs, e.g., AR
10930 (Inoue et al. 2011, 2012), AR 11158 (Inoue et al. 2013, 2014a), AR 12192 (Inoue et al. 2016; Bamba et al. 2017), that
were topologically comparable to the coronal ﬁelds of the ARs observed by SDO/AIA. For modeling these ARs, the method
successfully produced sigmoids or magnetic ﬂux ropes that were commonly observed before ﬂares. For this reason, the method
has often been used to generate initial conditions in the MHD simulations of solar ﬂares (Inoue et al. 2015, 2018; Inoue & Bamba

LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF AR NOAA 12673

5

2021; Muhamad et al. 2017). Moreover, the method has also been applied for studying the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of AR 12673
prior and after the X2.2 and X9.3 ﬂares (Inoue et al. 2018; Bamba et al. 2020; Yamasaki et al. 2021; Inoue & Bamba 2021).

The free energy comparison was conducted only for the emergence of AR 12673 between September 4 to September 6, 2017
to evaluate the conformity between the photospheric energy calculated in this study and the volumetric energy estimated using
the NLFFF model. We compared the energy evolution only for this AR because it was more complex and dynamic than other
ARs. We assumed that the comparison sufﬁced to represent the consistency between the photospheric magnetic energy and the
volumetric magnetic energy.

2.3. Electric Current Helicity

Current helicity is a measure of linkage or twist of electric currents. It is often used to characterize the degree of topological
complexity of a magnetic ﬁeld in an AR under the assumption of force-free ﬁeld (Zhang 2006; Maurya & Ambastha 2020;
Bobra & Couvidat 2015; Hazra et al. 2020). This quantity is commonly assumed to have the same sign as magnetic helicity,
although recently Russell et al. (2019) conjectured that this assumption is not true in general. Derivation of magnetic helicity
from observations is impractical, so it is more convenient to derive current helicity to deﬁne the degree of AR complexity. It
is also well known that there is a hemispheric sign rule of helicity, which describes that the northern (southern) hemisphere has
a dominance of negative (positive) helicity. However, previous studies showed that several ﬂaring ARs tend to not follow the
hemispheric helicity rule (Pevtsov et al. 1995; Park et al. 2021). In this study, we examined the helicity sign preference of our
several ARNs, which were located in the southern hemisphere. For this purpose, we used SHARP metadata to obtain the derived
mean current helicities of the series ARs during ﬁve CRs.

The electric current density was calculated from the given vector magnetogram data by using Ampere′s law, ∇ × B = µJ.
However, because the data only include information of a thin layer in the photosphere, only the vertical current density (Jz) can
be calculated. The derivation using Ampere′s law was realized using a ﬁnite-difference method with a 9-point stencil (Bobra et al.
2014). From the vertical current density, the proxy of the electric current helicity was estimated as follows:

Hc = Bz · Jz.

(7)

Mean current helicity for the whole AR was calculated as (Bobra et al. 2014)

1
N X
We assumed that the mean current helicity of each AR represents the dominant current helicity at that moment. It should be noted
that the error of mean current helicity given by SHARP team has included propagation errors of Bz and Jz. We found that the
errors of the current helicity were in the order of 1 × 10−3 G2/m, which was insigniﬁcant during the early period of the ﬂaring
ARs (12665 and 12673).

2.4. Extreme Ultraviolet Intensities

Another alternative for obtaining the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in an AR is evaluating the evolution of its extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) intensities. Ugarte-Urra et al. (2015) used the evolution of the EUV intensities of an AR observed at 304 ˚A by the
SDO/AIA to estimate the magnetic ﬂux on that AR. They found that the peak of the EUV 304 ˚A intensities during the AR
evolution was proportional to the lifetime of that AR. Therefore, to compare the long-term evolutions of AR 12665 and AR
12673, we calculated and compared their total EUV intensities from the SDO/AIA 304 ˚A for the AR 12665 and AR 12673.
The total EUV intensities for AR 12665 were calculated from July 8, 2017 at 00 UT to July 15, 2017 at 00 UT by summing all
intensities from the AR after subtracting the background intensities. The background intensities were calculated by averaging
the intensities of all pixels within the center part of the solar disk. For AR 12673, the total EUV intensities were calculated from
September 3, 2017 at 00 UT to September 9, 2017 at 00 UT. We avoided to utilizing the intensities data during a ﬂare period, at
least one hour before and after the ﬂare.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

3.1. Identiﬁcation of ARs

Synoptic maps of several CRs showed that the predecessor of AR 12673 was formed long before September 2017 (see Figure
1). This was indicated by the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld region in a similar spot to that of the AR 12673 location in CR
2194. We analyzed the AR from July 2017, when the presence of an AR was clearly observed. The locations of the ARs are

6

MUHAMAD ET AL.

marked by red circles in Figure 1. These ARs were identiﬁed as NOAA AR 12665, 12670, 12673, 12682, and 12685. Carrington
coordinates of these ARNs are listed in Table 1. As listed in Table 1, the location of AR 12673 was slightly behind the estimated
coordinate. This was because AR 12673 emerged in the negative (trailing) polarity region of the previous AR. Owing to the effect
of differential rotation in the Sun, the AR locations were slightly shifted to the west in the Carrington maps for the latter months.
We also tracked the active region in the EUV wavelength from July 6 to November 3, 2017, as shown in Figure 2. The results
conﬁrmed AR NOAA 12665, 12670, 12673, 12682, and 12685 as ARs reoccurring in the same region of the Sun. After selection
of the best tracking rate, we found that the rotational rate of AR 12665 in 195 ˚A wavelength was approximately 26.7◦/day. This
was consistent with the other reported results that the rotation rate of the Sun in its atmosphere observed at 193 ˚A is slower than
that in the photosphere (Sharma et al. 2020). We found that AR 12665 reoccurred as AR 12670 with decaying EUV intensity
over time and almost disappeared early September 2017, following which a new ﬂux emerged as AR 12673. The EUV intensity
of AR 12673 rapidly enhanced in the ﬁrst three days and remained high before decaying when the AR reoccurred in the east limb
as AR 12682. The AR continued to decay and became very faint when it reoccurred in the ﬁnal stage as AR 12685.

3.2. Flaring History and ARs Properties

Table 2 lists the period of occurrence of each identiﬁed ARN in the Earth-side solar disk and the total number of ﬂares for each
class produced by the ARN during the corresponding period. The table also lists the Hale class when each ARN formed its most
complex magnetic conﬁguration or produced ﬂares. Clearly the ARs evolution was highly dynamic for almost ﬁve months. Only
two ARNs (12665 and 12673) produced ﬂares greater than C1-class ﬂare, and only AR 12673 produced X-class ﬂares.

Table 2 also shows that there were some phase alternations between the ﬂare productive and quiet phases. During the passage
period of AR 12670, there was a pause in the ﬂare occurrence between the periods of AR 12665 and AR 12673. Time lag in
the ﬂare occurrences of AR 12665 and 12673 suggested that the AR had potential to achieve ﬂare periodicity of 50–55 days,
which is a harmonic of solar rotation period. The periodicity was a result of the reactivation of the AR after its dormant period.
This suggests that successive occurrence of ﬂares in the subsequent rotations is not ensured. Speciﬁcally, the long-term ﬂare
periodicity of the AR, which is considered to be related to solar rotation, was most probably a consequence of the long lifetime
or multiple recurrences of the AR. However, the ability of the AR to produce ﬂares was determined by other factors during its
evolution, which are discussed in the following subsection.

To examine the periodicity of the ﬂares during the lifetimes of the ARNs, a wavelet analysis of the GOES X-ray ﬂux time series
data during 2017 was performed. Because of the interest in only long-term characteristics, the one-minute data were averaged
per hour (XRF). The hourly averaged data are shown in Figure 3 (a). Because most of the ﬂux values were very small, in the
order of 10−8 – 10−7 W/m2, they were multiplied by 107 to enhance the order of the wavelet power. Because of the signiﬁcant
difference in the X-ray ﬂux between the X-class ﬂares on September 6 and 10, 2017 and other days, these could be identiﬁed as
very strong signals that almost nulliﬁed other signals during the more quiet days. Consequently, these could ignore the presence
of periodicities on other days of weak X-ray ﬂux emission from the Sun. Thus, we set a ﬁlter by applying a conditional rule to
XRF(t) when it exceeds a certain limit (vlim) as follows:

XRF (t) =

XRF (t)
vlim

+ vlim.

(9)

Here, vlim was set as 50 (W/m2 ×107). This limitation was applied because of the interest in only the pattern of the periodicity
occurrence. There was little importance for the exact magnitude of the maximum signal because the extreme values (> X-class
ﬂares) only occurred over three days (6, 7, and 10 September). The wavelet analysis was performed by employing a wavelet code
of Torrence & Compo (1998). This code calculates the mother Morlet wavelet of the signals that can yield the locations of the
dominant frequency in the time domain. In this study, wavelet analysis was performed on the ﬁltered XRF for each day during
one year (2017).

It can be seen from Figure 3 (b) that in only a few periods the Sun emitted strong X-ray ﬂux. The ﬁrst one was in April 2017,
when several M and C-class ﬂares occurred from AR 12644 and C-class ﬂares from AR 12645. AR 12644 was located in the
north hemisphere, whereas careful analysis using the HMI synoptic Carrington maps showed that AR 12645 was located in a
region different from the region of interest, although it was also located in the southern hemisphere. The second period was
associated with AR 12665 in July 2017, which released 29 C-class ﬂares and two M-class ﬂares, as listed in Table 2. The last
one was the most proliﬁc period when four X-class ﬂares and many less energetic ﬂares were released in September 2017, which
originated from AR 12673. These two ARNs (AR 12665 and AR 12673) were considered to be located in the same spot, as
discussed in the previous subsection. Several small pulses appeared although their magnitudes were relatively much smaller than
the three periods. These small pulses might also contribute to the production of a signal of periodicity.

Figure 3 (c) and (d) show the wavelet power spectrum and the global wavelet spectrum of the X-ray ﬂux in 2017, respectively.
Clearly strong powers appeared from approximately HOY 4500 (July) to HOY 7200 (October). This spectrum also exhibits the
existence of two dominant periods: approximately 25–30 days (one solar rotation) and 50–70 days (two solar rotations). Clearly,
these two periodicities were related to the existence of the AR 12665 and AR 12673. The one solar rotation periodicity could
have been generated from the weak X-ray ﬂux emitted by the strong ﬁeld region that periodically occurred in every rotation
within this period. The two-solar-rotation periodicity was generated by the ﬂares that originated from AR 12665 and AR 12673.

3.3. Magnetic Field Evolution

Within ﬁve solar rotations, the ARs dynamically evolved, which changed its ﬂare productivity. We investigated the magnetic
ﬁeld changed from the aspects of magnetic structure, total unsigned ﬂux, and its magnetic energy for each ARN. Note that we
only calculated the magnetic free energy and the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux for the region with magnetic ﬂux density larger
than 250 G to avoid low signal to noise ratio in the weak-ﬁeld region.

3.3.1. AR 12665

On the ﬁrst day itself since this ARN emerged from the east limb, the magnetic structure was a highly complex bipole magnetic
system. The radial component of the vector magnetic ﬁeld of the ARN is shown in Figure 4 (a). The bipole gradually separated
farther, and many C-class and one M-class ﬂares occurred as it approached the disk center on July 9, 2017. After these ﬂares,
the total magnetic ﬂux and the magnetic energy decreased 20% and 50%, respectively, which led to the more quiet condition
in the ARN. During the period from July 10 to July 13, 2017 the maximum total unsigned ﬂux was approximately 3.1 × 1022
Mx and the maximum of total photospheric magnetic energy was approximately 2 × 1023 erg/cm. The evolution of this ARN
after July 10 is shown in Figure 4 (b). The energy and the total magnetic ﬂux gradually increased from July 13, 2017, following
which many C-class and one M-class ﬂares occurred again. The magnetic energy evolution in general was consistent with the
total unsigned ﬂux evolution. The recurrence of the ﬂares in this ARN was particularly when the total magnetic ﬂux and the
photospheric magnetic energy were relatively high.

3.3.2. AR 12670

AR 12670 was a large bipole with a diffused magnetic ﬂux distributed over a wide area. The radial component of the vector
magnetic ﬁeld of this ARN is shown in Figure 5 (a). Figure 5 (b) shows that the magnetic energy of this ARN was lower than that
of the previous ARN. Moreover, both parameters presented a decreasing trend during its passage on the solar disk. Because the
magnetic structure of this ARN was relatively simple, the capability of this ARN to produce a ﬂare was low. Clearly, this ARN
succeeded AR 12665 when it was decaying.

3.3.3. AR 12673

This ARN was the most active ARN among the other ARNs during July to November 2017. In the beginning of its occurrence
from the east limb, the ARN was very similar to AR 12670. However, on September 2, 2017 a strong magnetic ﬂux started
to emerge from the core of the ARN and rapidly evolved to create the bipole magnetic structure. The emergence of a newly
emerging ﬂux of AR 12673 and its rapid evolution to form a complex AR are shown in Figure 6. The radial component of the
vector magnetic ﬁeld of this ARN is shown in Figure 7 (a). Figure 7 (b) shows the continuous increase in the total unsigned ﬂux
and the photospheric magnetic energy kept increasing after the initial emergence of the strong magnetic ﬂux. The rapid increase
in the magnetic ﬂux and the shearing and rotational motions that occurred in this region after September 2 was distinguishable
from that in the previous condition. This suggests that AR 12673 was a new AR that emerged in the remnant of the old AR.

On September 4, 2017 this structure continued to evolve and already formed a very complex structure with positive and negative
ﬂux emerging in between the bipoles as well as in other parts of the core region. This complex structure survived for the next
one week and produced many large ﬂares. A detailed analysis of the photospheric magnetogram data from September 3 to 6,
2017 suggested that at least ﬁve dipoles emerged and interacted with each other (Hou et al. 2018). The series of magnetic dipole
emergences in the north part of the main region together with the strong shearing motion and rotation created a long PIL that
contained high magnetic energy accumulations in its surrounding (see Figure 8).

Figure 8 shows how this ARN very rapidly evolved and gained its energy in one day from September 5, 2017 (Figures 8 (a)
and (c)) to September 6 (Figures 8 (b) and (d)). By September 6, 2017 at approximately 11 UT, a very high magnetic free energy
accumulated and reached 1.5 × 1024 erg/cm before signiﬁcantly decreasing after the X9.3 ﬂare. There was also a decrease in
the total unsigned ﬂux after the X9.3 ﬂare on September 6, 2017. Subsequently, the free energy tended to be constant until
September 8, 2017 although the unsigned magnetic ﬂux kept increasing. Our calculation of the magnitude and evolution of the

8

MUHAMAD ET AL.

total unsigned ﬂux was also consistent with the total unsigned ﬂux calculated by Moraitis et al. (2019). Many M and X-class
ﬂares were produced even until the ARN was in the very west limb of the solar disk, including X1.3 and X8.2 ﬂares, which
occurred on September 7 and 10, 2017 respectively.

Very strong shear and rotational motion were observed from the negative patch in the east to the positive patch in the west. A
ﬂow motion caused the negative patch to penetrate its counterpart and created a strong sheared ﬁeld along the PIL, which was
also observed in other studies, e.g., Yang et al. (2017) and Mitra et al. (2018). Bamba et al. (2020) argued that this continuous
intrusion of the negative-polarity patch into the neighboring opposite-polarity region triggered the occurrence of X2.2 and X9.3
ﬂares on September 6, 2017 from the high free energy region near the main PIL. The free energy intensiﬁed in this region before
the X9.3 ﬂare occurred, as shown in Figure 8 (d). Using NLFFF modeling, Hou et al. (2018) suggested that two magnetic ﬂux
ropes existed in the AR before the X9.3 ﬂare occurred. These became unstable owing to the strong shearing motion and rotation,
which caused the upper ﬂux rope to erupt upward owing to the kink-instability. A similar scenario of multiple emergence of
magnetic dipoles and the combination of the shearing motion and rotation was also believed to be responsible for the occurrence
of the X8.2 ﬂare on September 10, 2017.

3.3.4. AR 12682

This ARN was quiet with no solar ﬂares recorded during its passage on the solar disk. The magnetic structure clearly showed
the decay feature of AR 12673 with some magnetic ﬂux diffused to the wider region. The radial component of the magnetic
ﬁeld is shown in Figure 9 (a). Figure 9 (b) shows that the magnetic free energy decreased signiﬁcantly since the previous solar
rotation, and only less than ≈ 10% remained. Although the total magnetic ﬂux and the free energy increased again after October
1, 2017 there was no signiﬁcant increase in the activities from this ARN. This increase was possibly due to some of the negative
patches from the north entering the ﬁeld of view of the SHARP image and contributing to the enhancement in the total magnetic
ﬂux density in the negative-polarity region.

3.3.5. AR 12685

It is possible that AR 12682 continuously decayed to form AR 12685, which was very large in size. Consequently, this ARN
appeared almost as a unipolar ﬂux in the SHARP ﬁeld of view. Figures 10 (a) and (b) show the radial component of the magnetic
ﬁeld in this AR and the evolutions of the total magnetic ﬂux and the magnetic energy, respectively. This ARN was very quiet and
did not show any ﬂare potential. This AR was apparently the ﬁnal stage of AR 12673, which survived for several months since
September 2017. The total unsigned ﬂux and magnetic energy of this ARN were only approximately half of those of the previous
ARN. Clearly, still some small dynamic events occurred in the AR that changed the strength of its magnetic ﬂux and its magnetic
energy. For example, after 18 UT on October 27, 2017 the small positive patches in the northeast collided with each other and
formed stronger large positive patches. This occurred on a smaller scale for the negative patches. This phenomenon increased
both the total magnetic ﬂux and free energy of the AR, as shown in Figure 10 (b). However, this activity did not signiﬁcantly
change the general trend of the magnetic evolution of the AR, which was decaying. A very weak trace of the continuation of the
AR was found after AR 12685 appeared.

3.3.6. NLFFF Magnetic Energy

To verify the reliability and consistency of the photospheric free energy calculated using equation 6, it was compared with the
volumetric free energy calculated using equation 2 for the NLFFF model of AR 12673 from September 4 to September 6, 2017.
AIA 171 ˚A image of AR 12673 on September 4, 2017 at 00 UT and the corresponding NLFFF model extrapolated by the SHARP
data are shown in Figures 11 (a) and (b). The comparison of the evolution of both free energies is plotted in Figure 11 (c).

The general trends of both free energy evolutions were consistent. Speciﬁcally, the free energies consistently increased since
the emergence of the magnetic ﬂux until the occurrence of the X2.2 and X9.3 ﬂares. However, the volumetric free energy on the
NLFFF model increased more signiﬁcantly on September 4, 2017 than the photospheric free energy. This was possibly due to
the presence of the magnetic ﬂux rope in the NLFFF model, which could not be observed from the photospheric magnetogram
data. The magnetic ﬂux rope was also reported to form in many other studies on the NLFFF model of AR 12673 (Hou et al.
2018; Inoue et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018; Zou et al. 2020; Yamasaki et al. 2021) or in data-driven simulation (Price et al. 2019).
The magnetic free energy of the NLFFF drastically decreased after the X9.3 ﬂare on September 6, 2017. As has been described
earlier, the photospheric free energy also decreased after this ﬂare occurred.

It is important to note again that equation 6 calculates the nonpotentiality of the AR, and not the real free energy. From the
comparison shown in Figure 11 (c), it can be inferred that the evolution of the photospheric free energy calculated using equation
6 was in general consistent with that of the 3-D magnetic free energy calculated using the NLFFF model. The NLFFF model
provided more information about the 3-D structure of the magnetic ﬁeld in the corona, which contributed to the more realistic

LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF AR NOAA 12673

9

estimation of the free energy magnitude. However, this comparison conﬁrms that the equation 6 yields quite reliable results for
representing the free energy evolution of the AR.

3.4. Active Longitude and Current Helicity

We have shown that AR 12665, 12670, 12673, 12682, and 12685 occurred in the same region of the Sun. AR 12670 was
clearly the continuation of AR 12665 that reoccurred in the following disk passage. After one Carrington rotation, AR 12673
emerged in the extended plage of the negative (trailing) polarity of the decayed AR 12670 (see Figure 6). AR 12673 grew rapidly
and formed a very complex magnetic structure in just a few days. After one solar rotation, this AR became AR 12682 that was
less complex than its predecessor. In its ﬁnal stage, the AR reoccurred as AR 12685 before it totally decayed and disappeared.

The occurrences of the subsequent ARs over multiple rotations in the same region could indicate the presence of an active
longitude. We found that the Carrington longitudes of the ARNs during 5 CRs spanned between 111◦-133◦. This narrow
longitude band was close to the sunspot active zone near 90◦ of longitude that was commonly observed over multi solar rotations
(Ivanov 2007). Active longitude near 90◦ of Carrington longitude in the southern hemisphere was also observed in the ﬁrst
Carrington rotations in solar cycle 24 (Komm & Gosain 2015). However, we did not ﬁnd any AR in the southern hemisphere
that has longitude separation approximately 180 degrees with the studied ARs during 5 CRs. The opposite active longitude was
often observed to form a pair of active longitude in the Sun in the past solar cycles (Usoskin et al. 2005; Mandal et al. 2017).
However, we found two ARs (AR 12664 and 12671) that occurred in the northern hemisphere that were separated approximately
180 degrees of longitude from the studied ARs in the time period from July to November 2017. Among these two ARs, only AR
12671 that produced many ﬂares.

The magnetic ﬁeld characteristics of AR 12673 are distinctive compared to other ARNs, particularly in the amount of total
magnetic ﬂux, magnetic energy, ﬂux emergence rate, and rotational and translational motions. The rapid emergence of strong
magnetic ﬂux in the pre-existing AR may be related to the proliﬁc ﬂare-productivity of AR 12673. Previous studies suggested that
large-scale converging (Gizon et al. 2001) and vortex (Komm et al. 2007) ﬂows occurred around active regions. The combinations
of the two ﬂows are believed to be more effective in an AR near the active longitudes because many ARs frequently occurred
there. It indicates that some turbulence motions may play a role to rise ﬂux tubes from the subsurface and disturb the hemispheric
sign preference (HSP) of an AR (Komm & Gosain 2015). Moreover, the presence of such local turbulence below a pre-existing
AR may contribute to generate new emerging ﬂuxes that eventually create a very strong and complex AR that potentially produces
large ﬂares (Komm & Gosain 2015; Park et al. 2021). Our study shows that the emergence of AR 12673 in the pre-existing AR
(AR 12670) had some characteristics that were in agreement with this scenario. This could give a potential explanation for the
ﬂare-productive properties of AR 12673.

The peculiarities of the AR 12673 has been qualitatively discussed by Getling (2019), who found that the emergence of the
new emerging ﬂux in this AR was similar to the pattern of a ﬂuid ﬂow in a roundish body. He suggested that the dynamics of the
sunspot in this AR was related to the surface layer that emerged above the old cluster that was rooted to the deeper layers of the
convection zone.

Figure 12 shows mean current helicities of 5 ARNs during its passage in the solar disk calculated using equation 8. It can be
seen that the current helicities of the ﬂaring ARNs (AR 12665 and 12673) were relatively high during their ﬁrst rotations. The
helicities decreased when the ARs rotated for the second and the third times. During their early occurrences, ARs have negative
helicities. However, at the last rotations, the helicities were very low and the amount of helicities became comparable to the error
bars. During these last periods of the ARs, the signs of helicities were mix between positive and negative. The decreasing helicity
indicated that the magnetic helicity has been largely transferred from the photoshere to the corona or even to the interplanetary
space through some eruptions during the lifetime of the ARs.

We showed that AR 12665, 12673, 12682 have negative sign of current helicities. The negative current helicity sign of AR
12673 was also observed in other studies, e.g., (Yan et al. 2018; Vemareddy 2019; Moraitis et al. 2019). This sign was anti-
HSP for the southern hemisphere. The heliographic region around the Carrington longitude of the ARs in our study, which was
anti-HSP, had been found to be more ﬂare productive than other heliographic regions (Park et al. 2021). It was well known that
active regions that produced many ﬂares tended to not follow HSP rule (Pevtsov et al. 1995; Maurya & Ambastha 2020). Active
regions that have strong magnetic ﬁelds are also found to be anti-HSP (Zhang 2006). This tendency was consistent with the
mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory that the opposite helicity signs are produced in the mean ﬁeld and small-scale ﬂuctuations (Zhang
2006; Komm & Gosain 2015). Our study showed that the ARs that occurred during July-October 2017 conﬁrmed previous
ﬁndings that the strong ARs and ﬂare-productive ARs tended to oppose HSP.

3.5. EUV Intensities Evolution

10

MUHAMAD ET AL.

EUV intensity evolutions of AR 12665, 12670, 12673, 12682, and 12685 were studied to understand their relation with the
magnetic ﬁeld evolution of the ARNs. It was believed that EUV intensity evolution of an AR was linked to the evolution of its
magnetic ﬁeld (Ugarte-Urra et al. 2015). The total EUV intensity of an AR was also found to be closely related to the area of AR
(Verbeeck et al. 2013).

Figure 13 shows the comparison of the light curves of the EUV 304 ˚A for AR 12665 and AR 12673. The intensities of AR
12673 were higher than those of AR 12665. This is consistent with the higher total magnetic ﬂux amount of AR 12673 (see
Figures 4 and 7). Ugarte-Urra et al. (2015) found that the peak intensity of an AR observed at 304 ˚A was also proportional to
its lifetime. Because the peak intensity of AR 12673 was approximately thrice higher than that of AR 12665, the lifetime of AR
12673 was expected to be longer than that of AR 12665, which was actually found. However, the lifetime of AR 12665 was not
one-third of that of AR 12673. Note that AR 12665 had not really disappeared when AR 12673 emerged, which made the precise
comparison of their lifetime difﬁcult.

In general, we found that the EUV intensities of the ARs were proportional to the total magnetic ﬂux of the ARs. This means
that the stronger magnetic ﬁeld of an AR, the brighter the AR in the EUV wavelength. Nevertheless, the peak EUV intensities
did not always have constant proportion with the total magnetic ﬂux. For example, AR 12673, which was three times brighter
than AR 12665, has a total magnetic ﬂux that was two times stronger than that of AR 12665.

Evolution of the EUV intensities also has the same trend with the total magnetic ﬂux evolution. It can be seen from Figure
13 that the EUV intensity of the ﬂaring AR 12665 and 12673 were decreasing until they disappeared in the third disk passage.
Therefore, we found that EUV intensity evolution of the AR could be a proxy for the total magnetic ﬂux evolution. This
is in agreement with other results that studied the long-term evolution of EUV intensities of several ARs in solar cycle 24
(Ugarte-Urra et al. 2015; Iglesias et al. 2020). However, we could not ﬁnd any clear signature of a ﬂare precursor in the EUV
intensities evolution of the ﬂaring ARs prior to the ﬂares. The only indication of the occurrence of the ﬂaring AR was a rapid
enhancement of the EUV intensity during the early occurrence of the newly emerging ﬂux of AR 12673 (see Figure 13). This
rapid increase of EUV intensities infers that the dynamics of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld is closely linked with the dynamics of the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We showed and identiﬁed the recurrent ARs from July to November 2017 over multiple solar rotations. Although there was a
differential rotation effect, the traces of the ARs were still clearly distinguishable. The magnetic ﬁeld of each AR dynamically
evolved periodically and affected its productivity. The magnetic ﬁeld structures of the ARs and their properties signiﬁcantly
differed over multiple rotations.

We found that although AR 12673 apparently occurred in the same region as AR 12665 and AR 12670, this ARN was actually
a result of a new emerging ﬂux on a pre-existing fading AR. This suggested that AR 12673 was a distinguished magnetic system
that was different from its predecessors, which was AR 12665. The main differences between these two ARs were the emerging
and the complexity growth rates. These were clearly observed from the variations in the development rate and magnitude of the
photospheric free energy evolution. AR 12673 had a much higher emerging rate and became a very complex AR owing to the
combination of the shearing and rotating motions. A difference was also observed in the intensities of EUV 304 ˚A at the peak
times of AR 12665 and AR 12673. Speciﬁcally, AR 12673 produced almost three times stronger EUV 304 ˚A intensities than its
predecessor.

AR 12665 and 12673 occurred in the magnetic activity complex that was located in the southern hemisphere spanned from
111◦–133◦ of Carrington longitude. This location was suspected to be associated with the active longitude near 90◦ of Carrington
longitude that has been long observed in the southern hemisphere for multiple solar cycles. The emergence of AR 12673 in the
pre-existing AR 12670 indicated that the subsurface magnetic activity near the active longitude played an important role to
generate strong magnetic ﬂux with high complexity that led to the occurrence of the ﬂare-productive AR. Komm & Gosain
(2015) suggested that the combination of sub-photospheric converging and vortex ﬂows in a magnetic complex can generate a
newly emerging ﬂux that interacts with pre-existing AR to create a more complex AR. Getling (2019) found that the emergence
of magentic ﬂux of AR 12673 in the pre-existing AR 12670 was similar to a ﬂuid ﬂow in a roundish body.

The two ﬂaring ARs (12665 and 12673) had negative current helicities, which were opposite to the helicity sign preference in
the southern hemisphere. In the subsequent rotations, helicity signs of AR 12665 (as AR 12670) and AR 12673 (as AR 12682
and then 12685) tended to be in agreement with the HSP. Komm & Gosain (2015) suggested that the dynamics of magnetic
ﬁeld in the convection zone near the active longitude was responsible for the creation of AR that opposed HSP. Anti-HSP AR
was commonly found to emerge in the pre-existing magnetic ﬂux of prior AR (Komm & Gosain 2015). It is possible that the
emergence of the newly emerging ﬂux of AR 12673 in the remnant of the prior AR (12670) was related to the abovementioned

LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF AR NOAA 12673

11

process. This could explain why the AR 12673 had a negative helicity sign and produced so many ﬂares. By analyzing relative
magnetic helicities in the Sun for almost one solar cycle (solar cycle 24), Park et al. (2021) also found that the heliographic region
where AR 12673 occurred was very ﬂare-productive and strongly dominated by negative helicity.

Our results show that the build-up of the nonpotentiality in AR 12673 was rapid in the early stage of its emergence, and it
soon became ﬂare-productive. Subsequently, the AR decayed and did not produce any ﬂare during its long decaying stage.
This behaviour was consistent with previous results of van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (1999) and van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2003)
who studied the long-term evolution of AR 7978. We found that the AR became ﬂare-productive when a strong magnetic ﬂux
emerged and formed a relatively complex structure within 3–5 days. The complex structure could have been created by the
shearing and rotating motions in the photosphere that simultaneously occurred during the emergence of the strong magnetic ﬂux.
These mechanisms–the emergence of strong magnetic ﬂux and the shearing or rotating motions in the photosphere–were the main
determinants of the ﬂare productivity of the long-lived AR (see Toriumi & Wang (2019) for the characteristics of ﬂare-productive
ARs).

Because AR 12665 and AR 12673 emerged at the same location, they could be sources for ﬂare periodicity in a multi-rotations
time range. In the ARs considered in this study, ﬂares occurred only in two ARNs that were separated by one solar rotation.
This might be interpreted as an indicator of the harmonics of the solar rotation in the ﬂare periodicity. Furthermore, the existence
of the ﬂare periodicities during July–November 2017, which are related to solar rotation and its harmonics, was due to the long
lifetime and dynamics of the AR. This long-term ﬂare periodicity itself cannot be used as an early warning for solar ﬂares unless
an AR maintains its magnetic structures for more than one rotation. However, the magnetic structures of the recurrent ARs in our
study changed signiﬁcantly over multiple rotations. This suggests that the complexity of the AR did not survive for more than
one rotation. The reactivation of the AR, most probably requires a new strong emerging ﬂux that emerges on the decaying AR.

We revealed that the properties of the reoccurring ARs and their relations with the location of active longitude might be useful
for a long-term prediction of solar ﬂares. Our results show that it is important to conduct long-term observations of ARs to
identify the locations of active longitudes in order to anticipate the occurrence of a ﬂaring AR. However, the timescale of the
magnetic energy build-up in the ﬂaring AR was on the order of several days. Flares tended to occur when the total unsigned ﬂux
and the total photospheric free magnetic energy were relatively high. Both parameters could be ﬂuctuated by the ﬂux emergence
rate and the dynamics motion in the photosphere within a time range of 2–3 days. Therefore, advancing ﬂare prediction by more
than one week is still very challenging with only the information obtained from the magnetogram data and even ﬂare history.
