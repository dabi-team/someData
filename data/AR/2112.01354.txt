ABSTRACT

Context. Plasma loops or plumes rooted in sunspot umbrae often harbor downﬂows with speeds of 100 km s−1. These downﬂows are
supersonic at transition region temperatures of ∼ 0.1 MK. The source of these ﬂows is not well understood.
Aims. We aim to investigate the source of sunspot supersonic downﬂows (SSDs) in active region (AR) 12740 using simultaneous
spectroscopic and imaging observations.
Methods. We identiﬁed SSD events from multiple raster scans of a sunspot by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and
calculated the electron densities, mass ﬂuxes and velocities of these SSDs. The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images provided by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the EUV Imager (EUVI) onboard the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) were employed to investigate the origin of these SSDs and their associated coronal rain.
Results. Almost all the identiﬁed SSDs appear at the footpoints of sunspot plumes and are temporally associated with appearance of
chromospheric bright dots inside the sunspot umbra. Dual-perspective EUV imaging observations reveal a large-scale closed magnetic
loop system spanning the sunspot region and a remote region. We observed that the SSDs are caused by repeated coronal rain that
forms and ﬂows along these closed magnetic loops toward the sunspot. One episode of coronal rain clearly indicates that reconnection
near a coronal X-shaped structure ﬁrst leads to the formation of a magnetic dip. Subsequently, hot coronal plasma catastrophically
cools from ∼2 MK in the dip region via thermal instability. This results in the formation of a transient prominence in the dip, from
which the cool gas mostly slides into the sunspot along inclined magnetic ﬁelds under the gravity. This drainage process manifests as
a continuous rain ﬂow, which lasts for ∼2 hrs and concurrently results in a nearly steady SSD event. The total mass of condensation
(1.3 × 1014 g) and condensation rate (1.5 × 1010 g s−1) in the dip region were found to be suﬃcient enough to sustain this long-lived
SSD event, which has a mass transport rate of 0.7 − 1.2 × 1010 g s−1.
Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that coronal condensation in magnetic dips can result in the quasi-steady sunspot supersonic
downﬂows.

1. Introduction

High-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations in the
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) passbands
have revealed many types of ﬁne structures and dynamic events
in the upper atmosphere above sunspots (see a recent review by
Tian 2017). One type of such phenomena are downﬂows har-
bored by plasma loops rooted in sunspots. These ﬂows were ﬁrst
discovered as strongly redshifted secondary emission peaks at
supersonic speeds in the transition region (TR) spectra in the
1980s (e.g., Dere 1982; Nicolas et al. 1982; Brekke et al. 1990;
Gurman 1993).

Early observations revealed that these sunspot supersonic
downﬂows (SSDs) are quasi-steady, and that they tend to form
at the footpoints of sunspot plumes (Kjeldseth-Moe et al. 1988;
Brynildsen et al. 2001, 2004). With the launch of the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS, De Pontieu et al. 2014),
SSDs in TR lines have recently received more and more at-
tention. A statistical investigation by Samanta et al. (2018) re-
vealed that: (1) SSDs commonly exist in the majority (80%) of

sunspots; (2) apart from redshifts in TR spectral lines, half of
the SSD events have strong redshifted signatures also in chromo-
spheric spectral lines. Thus, these SSDs likely play an important
role in the chromosphere-corona mass cycle of the sunspot at-
mosphere. In TR spectral observations of IRIS, SSDs are found
to be often associated with two types of spectra: (1) spectral lines
that exhibit a broad enhancement at the red wings (e.g., Kleint
et al. 2014; Ishikawa et al. 2020) or (2) spectral lines with a sec-
ondary emission peak that clearly separates from the near pri-
mary component (e.g., Tian et al. 2014; Straus et al. 2015; Nel-
son et al. 2020a,b). These above-mentioned studies show that the
Doppler velocity, electron density, and mass ﬂux of TR SSDs are
generally in the range of 50 − 200 km s−1, 109.48−1010.86 cm−3,
and 10−7.5−10−6 g cm−2 s−1, respectively. These SSDs eventually
can impart their energy into the lower atmosphere of sunspots as
their speeds decrease from the supersonic to a sub-sonic state
(Straus et al. 2015; Chitta et al. 2016; Schad et al. 2021).

Considering the time variation of their associated TR spec-
tra, SSDs could be intermittent or long-lived. Intermittent SSDs,
such as those observed by Kleint et al. (2014), have been linked

to impulsive coronal rain (Ishikawa et al. 2020) that may result
from coronal condensation in the coronal part of the loops via
thermal non-equilibrium (TNE, Antiochos & Klimchuk 1991;
Klimchuk & Luna 2019) and/or thermal instability (Parker 1953;
Field 1965) 1 The bursty (of the order 20 s) behavior of their
spectra is naturally explained by the intermittent and clumpy
character of coronal rain, as often seen in simulations (e.g.,
Müller et al. 2003, 2004) and observations (e.g., Antolin et al.
2015). The origin of the long-lived and steady SSDs is less
clear. In their spectra, the intensities and Doppler velocities of
the downﬂow components often remain relatively stable on a
timescale of at least ∼1 hour (Tian et al. 2014; Straus et al.
2015), meaning that a substantial and stable mass supply is re-
quired to sustain such SSDs. Straus et al. (2015) and Chitta et al.
(2016) made a rough calculation and found that if all the mate-
rial comes from a usual quiescent coronal loop undergoing catas-
trophic cooling near its apex, it would not have enough plasma to
sustain these steady downﬂows. Hence, these authors speculated
that these long-lived steady SSDs may be fed by siphon ﬂows
from the other (conjugate) footpoint.

The measured densities and velocities of long-lived steady
SSDs are similar to those of coronal rain events (e.g., Schri-
jver 2001; Antolin & Rouppe van der Voort 2012a; Antolin et al.
2012b, 2015; Straus et al. 2015). Using chromospheric observa-
tions at a sub-arcsecond spatial resolution, Antolin et al. (2015)
have found that in AR closed coronal loops, intermittent coronal
rain clumps can be reshaped as more persistent and continuous
rain ﬂows at chromospheric heights, perhaps due to funneling of
magnetic ﬁelds loops. These clues imply the possibility that both
the intermittent and stable SSDs might have a common origin:
ﬂows of condensation forming above sunspots due to thermal
instability and/or TNE.

Li et al. (2018) have reported one category of quiescent
coronal rain on the solar limb, where magnetic reconnection fa-
cilitates coronal condensation occurring in high-lying magnetic
structures via the formation of magnetic dips. Compared to the
traditional condensation models (e.g., Miki´c et al. 2013; Fang
et al. 2015; Xia & Keppens 2016) that are based primarily on
TNE and/or thermal instability in usual coronal loops, Li et al.
(2018)’s coronal rain scenario highlights the important role of re-
connection or reconﬁguration of ﬁeld lines in the onset of coro-
nal condensation. With the presence of magnetic dips, plasma
condensed in the hot corona via thermal instability and/or TNE
can accumulate as (transient) solar prominences/ﬁlaments. In
this process, cool plasma can drain to the solar surface along
the legs of newly reconnected ﬁeld lines, forming persistent and
continuous coronal rain ﬂows. Although the source of hotter ma-
terial that initially feed the observed condensations remains un-
clear, a series of similar observations revealed that continuous
coronal rain ﬂows from such condensations can persist over sev-
eral to ten hours (e.g., Li et al. 2019, 2020). If such long-lasting
rain ﬂows persistently fall into a sunspot along coronal loops, it
might result in long-lived steady SSDs.

Recently, a He i spectropolarimetric study of SSDs from
Schad et al. (2021) further supports this hypothesis. In their ob-
servations, after a coronal catastrophic cooling event occurring
above a large sunspot, a cloud-like ﬁlament soon forms at the
apex (or dips) of an active-region magnetic loop system and
some portion of cool material subsequently drains towards the
sunspot as blob- and stream-like rain ﬂows, causing a chromo-

1 TNE and thermal instability are two important physical mechanisms
to explain coronal rain and prominence formation in observations. For
more details, refer to Klimchuk (2019) and Antolin (2020).

spheric SSD event in simultaneous spectral observations (see
also Schad et al. 2016). However, their single (32-minute) slit
scan at He i 10830 Å triplet impeded them to address the time
variation of SSD spectra at diﬀerent spectral lines.

Here, we investigate a series of SSD events above NOAA
active region (AR) 12740, using observations from IRIS, the
New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST; Liu et al. 2014), the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO, Wuelser et al. 2004) on 2019 May 8–
9. The joint observations obtained from multiple vantage points
make them ideal ones for an investigation of the origin of SSDs.
We ﬁnd that these SSDs are closely related to repeated coro-
nal ran activities, and provide strong evidence that reconnection-
facilitated coronal condensation in high-lying magnetic dips can
induce the long-lived steady SSD event. We describe the obser-
vational data in Section 2, present the main results in Section 3,
and discuss our results in Sections 4. A brief conclusion is given
in Section 5.

2. Observations and data

2.1. IRIS rasters and spectra

IRIS has one near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2782.7–2835.1 Å) and
two far-ultraviolet channels (FUV; 1331.7–1358.4 Å and
1389.0–1407.0 Å), which can provide simultaneous images and
spectra of the temperature minimum, chromosphere, TR, and
corona (De Pontieu et al. 2014). During 2019 May 7-8, IRIS ob-
served NOAA AR 12740 near the disk centre and performed ﬁve
repeated raster scans. The ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of the slit-jaw im-
ages (SJI) for each raster is shown in Fig. 1 (a). Note that the ﬁrst
four repeats were taken in the very large dense 320-step raster
mode, while the last episode was taken in the 4-step raster mode
(hereafter, we term them as Rasters 1-5, respectively). More in-
formation of these raster scans is listed in Table 1.

To identify and characterize SSDs we employed the cali-
brated Level-2 IRIS spectral data, which has already been pro-
cessed with dark current subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding, orbital vari-
ation and geometrical corrections (De Pontieu et al. 2014).
The following spectral lines were used in this study: (1) Si iv
1394/1403 Å and O iv 1400/1401 Å lines formed in the TR with
a typical formation temperature of around 0.08 and 0.15 MK, re-
spectively; (2) Mg ii h 2803 Å and Mg ii k 2796 Å lines with a
formation temperature of 0.01 MK in the chromosphere; and (3)
C ii 1334/1335 Å lines with a formation temperature of around
0.25 MK, in the upper chromosphere or lower TR. Spectral lines
from nearby neutral and singly ionized atoms, e.g., C i, O i, Ni ii,
S i, Mn i, in a quiet-Sun region were used for the absolute wave-
length calibration (e.g., Tian et al. 2016; Hou et al. 2016).

2.2. Imaging observations from the NVST, SDO, and

STEREO-A

To investigate the atmospheric response of SSDs at diﬀerent
heights, we also analyzed data from imaging observations with
the NVST, SDO, IRIS, and STEREO-A. NVST is a 1-m ground-
based vacuum solar telescope in China, which can observe ﬁne
structures in the lower atmosphere of the Sun (Yan et al. 2020).
On 2019 May 8, NVST tracked the AR 12740 during the period
of 01:10 − 05:03 UT, and provided Level 1+ high-resolution im-
ages of the Hα 6562.8 Å, Hα line wings at ± 0.4 Å, and TiO.
These images have been calibrated through dark current and ﬂat
ﬁeld corrections, and were further reconstructed by a speckle

Hechao Chen et al.: Transition Region Supersonic Downﬂows

masking method (Xiang et al. 2016). In addition, EUV images
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) onboard the SDO and 1400 Å slit-jaw images from the
IRIS were utilized. All these images were co-aligned by ﬁnd-
ing common features observed in diﬀerent channels. In addi-
tion, the 195 Å, 304 Å, and 171 Å images from the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004) onboard the
STEREO-A spacecraft were also analzyed to investigate the
SSD-related coronal activity from a diﬀerent perspective (see
Fig. 1 (b)). The spatial resolution of all the images involved
is given as follow, i.e. NVST Hα images ∼0.165(cid:48)(cid:48), NVST TiO
images ∼0.052(cid:48)(cid:48), AIA EUV images ∼1.5(cid:48)(cid:48), IRIS slitjaw images
∼0.4(cid:48)(cid:48), and STEREO EUVI images ∼2.5(cid:48)(cid:48).

3. Analysis and results

3.1. Sunspot supersonic downﬂows detected by IRIS

3.1.1. Spatial extent and temporal evolution

As mentioned above, from 2019 May 7 to 8, through ﬁve raster
scans IRIS detected clear spectral signatures of SSDs as the slit
scanned the sunspot region. As presented in Fig. 1 (c) and its
associated animation, the Mg ii k2 and h2 images reconstructed
from the 320-step raster scans of IRIS in Fig. 1 (c) reveal that
elongated coronal rain ﬂows falling into the sunspot. One exam-
ple of SSD events is shown in Figs. 1 (d-g). We can see that the
SSDs manifest themselves as obvious emission enhancements in
the red wings of C ii, Si iv, O iv, and Mg ii lines. In Fig. 2 (a),
an overview of the sunspot region at diﬀerent atmospheric layers
is presented. Note that the sunspot can be divided into two parts
by a developing light bridge. For brevity, hereafter, we term the
eastern (western) part of the umbra as region A (B).

Through scrutinizing IRIS spectra, we found clear signatures
of SSD events occurring in both regions A and B. At a temper-
ature of 0.08 MK, i.e. in the source region of Si iv, the sound
speed is of the order of 50 km s−1. This underlines that the ve-
locities found in the SSDs are very high. In Table 1, we list the
time periods during which SSDs were detected. To examine the
spatial extent and temporal evolution of SSDs, for each raster
we summed the red wing of the Si iv 1403 Å line proﬁle over
the spectral positions with Doppler shifts larger than 50 km s−1
and smaller than 300 km s−1, and obtained a map of the down-
ﬂow intensity. Figure 2 (b) presents such maps for Rasters 1-4.
Regarding the spatial structures of SSDs, a strand-like morphol-
ogy is found in both regions A and B (see similar features also in
Nelson et al. 2020a). The projected length (width) of the down-
ﬂow structures is about 6(cid:48)(cid:48)−19(cid:48)(cid:48) (2(cid:48)(cid:48)−3(cid:48)(cid:48)), comparable to the up-
per limit of the length (width) of coronal rain clumps (Antolin
et al. 2015). A comparison of these structures with the AIA 171
Å image in Figure 2 (a) suggests that these downﬂows are mag-
netically conﬁned at the footpoints of sunspot plumes (see also
Chitta et al. 2016; Nelson et al. 2020a,b). Regarding their time
variation, we can see that the stand-like downﬂow structures in
region A are enhanced from Raster 1 to 3, disappear in Raster
4, and then recur during Raster 5 (see also Fig. 4). A similar
structure in region B ﬁrst appear during Raster 3, and undergo
an enhancement during Raster 4. These results reveal that SSDs
exhibit a relatively active temporal evolution (see also Nelson et
al. 2020a), which are quite similar to the observed behavior of
usual quiescent coronal rain ﬂows occurring in AR closed loops
(e.g., Antolin et al. 2015).

3.1.2. Spectral line parameters and mass ﬂux

We derive spectral line parameters of SSD events focusing on
a small spectral window from 1399 Å to 1404 Å. This spectral
window contains the Si iv 1403 Å line, and the O iv 1400/1401
Å line pair whose ratio is sensitive to the electron density of the
TR plasma. Examples of spectra in the selected window are dis-
played in Figs. 2 (c) and (f). These spectra have been averaged
over the red box in region A during Raster 3 and the white box
in region B during Raster 4, respectively. Due to the existence
of SSDs, a downﬂow component appears as a secondary emis-
sion peak in the red wing of each of the O iv 1400 Å, O iv 1401
Å, and Si iv 1403 Å lines. As shown in Figs. 2 (c) and (f), a
six-component Gaussian function was applied to ﬁt the spectra
(also see Samanta et al. 2018). The ﬁtting results of the primary
and secondary components are plotted separately as the red and
blue lines, respectively. The Doppler shifts, line widths and peak
intensities of both the primary and secondary (downﬂow) com-
ponents during diﬀerent raster scans were then obtained. For the
faster SSD component, the Doppler shifts of the O iv 1400/1401
Å and Si iv 1403 Å lines in the two regions appear to be very sim-
ilar, with an average value of ∼95 km s−1. For the primary com-
ponents, the average Doppler shifts of the O iv 1400/1401 Å and
Si iv 1403 Å lines in the two regions are around 14 km s−1 and 7
km s−1, respectively. These redshifts are similar in magnitude to
the well-known average redshifts of TR lines (e.g., Brekke 1993;
Brekke et al. 1997; Chae et al. 1998; Peter & Judge 1999; Peter
1999). It is worth mentioning that these SSDs were also detected
in the Mg ii k 2796 Å line. As shown in Figs. 2 (e) and (h),
an isolated downﬂow component also appears in the red wing
of the Mg ii k line. The peak of this component corresponds to a
red shift of ∼135 km s−1. This corresponds to a ﬂow signiﬁcantly
faster than seen in Si iv and O iv forming at higher temperatures.
We will revisit this point in Section 4.1.

The intensity ratio of the O iv 1400/1401 Å line pair is known
to be sensitive to electron density in the TR. Based on the CHI-
ANTI atomic database 7.1 (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2013),
the theoretical dependence of the intensity ratio of the O iv line
pair on electron density was calculated. We estimated the elec-
tron densities, log(ne), of both the primary and downﬂow com-
ponents during each raster from the measured intensity ratios of
the O iv line pair, and list them in Table 1. Examples of electron
density diagnostics in Regions A and B are shown in Figs. 2 (d)
and (g), respectively. This will represent the density at tempera-
tures of around 0.15 MK, i.e. in the source region of O iv, which
is forming at temperatures almost a factor of two higher than
Si iv. For region A, the logarithmic density of downﬂow com-
ponent varies in the range of 9.88−10.47 cm−3 during Rasters
1−5 (see Table 1); and the average values of the primary and
0.65 cm−3 and 10.28 ± 0.44
downﬂow components are 10.69 ± 0.45
0.83
cm−3, respectively. For region B, the logarithmic electron den-
sity of the primary and downﬂow components are only obtained
0.93 cm−3,
in Raster 4, which are 10.61 ± 0.39
respectively. These values roughly agree with the estimated val-
ues found in the statistical work of Samanta et al. (2018) , and
the density values of the downﬂow components are comparable
to the typical electron density of coronal rain as well (e.g., An-
tolin et al. 2015).

0.51 cm−3 and 10.52 ± 0.48

Assuming a He/H abundance ratio of 1:10 and complete ion-
ization of the plasma, the mass ﬂux (∆m) of SSDs can be com-
puted as 1.2nempvSSD, where mp denotes the mass of proton.
We used the Doppler velocity of SSDs, ∼100 km s−1, as vSSD.
As a result, the typical mass ﬂux of SSDs was estimated to be

Notes. The observation dates are 2019 May 7–8. In columns 9 and 12, the durations are the time periods when the SSDs were detected in regions
A and B during the raster scans, respectively. The symbol “-:-:-" means that no SSDs were detected as the slit scanned this region. The symbol

3.2. Linking sunspot supersonic downﬂows to coronal rain

ﬂows

The simultaneous SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI observa-
tions reveal that repeated coronal rain events occur near the
sunspot during the IRIS raster scans. To verify the close link be-
tween the SSDs and these coronal rain ﬂows, we give a detailed
investigation on their temporal and spatial correspondence. Fig-
ure 3 shows one episode of on-disk coronal rain between 00:50
UT to 01:20 UT. At the same time, IRIS (Raster 2) scanned the
same region. The coronal rain events are best captured in the
AIA 304 Å image sequence, where we can see obvious cool
materials draining downward to the sunspot (region A) along
a set of trajectories in a funnel-like structure. In Fig. 3 (b), we
present the space-time diagram for one falling path (trajectory
S0 in panel (a)). The parabolic track of the coronal rain ﬂows in-
dicates an acceleration of 230 m s−2 (∼5/6 of the solar gravity).
The apparent velocity increases to ∼192 km s−1 near the sunspot
region. With simultaneous IRIS observations, these falling cool
materials can be identiﬁed as a redshifted feature in the C ii
1334/1335 Å, Si iv 1403 Å, and Mg ii k 2796 Å lines (see Figs. 3
(c1-c3) and the associated animation). The coronal-rain-induced
redshifted feature rapidly drifted southward along the slit with
an increasing redshift (up to 200 km s−1). Note that the instan-
taneous spectral redshift is comparable to the apparent falling
velocity measured from the space-time diagram, suggesting that
the falling path is aligned roughly 45 deg with respect to the
line of sight. The largest redshift is much higher than the aver-
age redshift (∼ 95 km s−1) of SSDs, likely because the latter was
inferred from four spectra that separately averaged over 3(cid:48)(cid:48)×3(cid:48)(cid:48)
small boxes in Fig. 2 (b) during Rasters 1-4.

Figure 4 presents images taken during another episode of
IRIS observations from 16:30 UT to 19:30 UT, i.e., Raster 5, to-
gether with simultaneous STEREO-A/EUVI observations. Since
STEREO-A observed the Sun from a diﬀerent perspective, the
coronal rain events were recorded at the limb in EUVI images.
During this period IRIS performed 4-step repeated raster scans
above the sunspot, in region A. Obvious spectral signatures of
the SSDs were detected at the 4th slit position shown in Fig. 4
(a). We averaged the spectra of Si iv 1403 Å, O iv Å, and Mg ii k
within the section marked by the green line shown in Fig. 4 (a),
and plotted their temporal evolution in Figs. 4 (b1)-(b3). Inter-
estingly, the SSDs we detected here appear as a quasi-steady sec-

ondary redshifted emission peak in both TR and chromospheric
lines, which remains relatively stable between 18:55 UT to 19:30
UT with a redshift of 84−88 km s−1 in TR lines and of 107
km s−1 in Mg ii k. In the meantime, EUVI captured an episode
of coronal rain draining into the sunspot region from a (mag-
netic) dip in the 304 Å channel (Fig. 4 (c) and the associated
animation of Fig. 6). To better illustrate this process, a space-
time diagram was constructed for the trajectory “S1" shown in
Fig. 4 (c) , which passes through the dip region (marked by the
green “+" sign) and the sunspot region (marked by the cyan “+"
sign). Note that a cyan “+" is also marked at the same helio-
centric position in Fig. 4 (a), which is located at the centre of
the sunspot. From the space-time diagram shown in Fig. 4 (d),
we can see that the cool materials ﬁrst appear in the dip region
around 17:00 UT, and then drain into the sunspot during the pe-
riod of 18:55 UT− 21:00 UT (around 2 hrs). This is well in line
with the period of SSD appearance in the TR spectral lines, as
shown in Figs. 4 (b1)-(b3) . This temporal correspondence fur-
ther conﬁrms that the SSD events detected in our observations
originate from the mass drainage in coronal rain events. Unfor-
tunately, this IRIS observation ended at 19:30 UT, whereas the
mass drainage of coronal rain lasts for another 1.5 hrs. Note that
in Fig. 4 (b3), there seems to be an acceleration trend of the rain
in time with rain produced later falling faster. This trend may
also be present in the TR lines (see Figs. 4 (b1)-(b2)), but due to
their lower spatial and spectral resolution it is not as clear as in
Mg ii k.

3.3. Coronal rain activities and magnetic dips

We then investigated the formation process of the coronal rain.
We examined the AIA and EUVI observations, and conﬁrmed
the absence of ﬂares near the sunspot. Figure 5 shows a global
picture of the coronal rain activity from the vantage point of
STEREO-A. As shown in EUVI 171 and 304 Å images, a large-
scale closed magnetic loop system spans from remote regions to
AR 12740, in which a quiescent prominence is gradually form-
ing during 10:00−21:00 UT. In this course, a series of coro-
nal rain also repeatedly form in the magnetic loop system and
ﬂow towards the sunspot region during the IRIS raster scans
(Rasters 1−5). Considering their forming regions, these coronal
rain ﬂows can be characterized as three types. One type is typ-
ical quiescent coronal rain ﬂows appearing near the west leg of
the loop system, which repeatedly form in sunspot plumes and
directly ﬂow into the sunspot during the period of 01:00 −16:00
UT. The second type is episodes of large-scale apparent horizon-
tal mass ﬂows, seen as spill-out events from the nearby funnel

or tower prominence structures (e.g., Liu et al. 2014; Antolin et
al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2021) that ﬂow towards the sunspot region
along overlying large-scale coronal loops (as marked in Figure 5
(b2)). A third type is continuous rain ﬂows originating from a
newly-formed magnetic dip region (as marked in Figure 5 (b))
during Raster 5. Note that a portion of large-scale horizontal
mass ﬂows seem to continuously inject cool material into this
newly-formed dip region.

Magnetic dips are region of upward concavity appearing
upon ﬁeld lines, in which the cold condensation can settle in and
grow in size. Thus, the appearance of magnetic dips is thought
to be important for the formation and maintenance of promi-
nences/ﬁlaments (e.g., Liu et al. 2012; Vial & Engvold 2015;
Chen et al. 2018a). From Fig. 6 and its associated online ani-
mation, we can that a clear coronal condensation process occurs
at the dip region of our interest. This process can be identiﬁed
from the EUVI 304 Å, 195 Å, and 171 Å images. The low-
cadence (2 hr) EUVI 171 Å images appear to suggest that the dip
forms during the period of 16:06 UT−18:09 UT. Thanks to the
higher-cadence EUVI 195 Å (5 min) and 304 Å (10 min) obser-
vations, we conﬁrm that the dip ﬁrst appears at 16:45:30 UT in

the EUVI 195 Å passband (see Fig. 6 (e4)), and evident conden-
sation starts subsequently at 16:56:15 UT (see Fig. 6 (e3)). This
timing suggests the formation of the dip as a possible precur-
sor of the onset of coronal condensation in the nearby region. As
cool materials gradually ﬁll the dip region, continuous rain ﬂows
drain towards the sunspot along high-lying magnetic structures
at about 18:46:15 UT. In the meantime, the dip region experi-
ences a downward motion, temporarily manifesting as one of
the tower or pillar prominence feet (as marked by cyan arrows in
Figs. 5 (a4) and (b4)), which supports that some vertical feet of
prominences may consist of piling-up magnetic dips (e.g., Liu et
al. 2012; Shen et al. 2015). Subsequently, the cool materials also
drain along a set of newly-formed magnetic arches linking the
site below the dip region to the sunspot region around 20:46:15
UT, implying the generation of new loops through reconnection
between the dip region and the lower-lying magnetic ﬁeld. This
is similar to the coronal condensation phenomena reported by
Li et al. (2018) and Srivastava et al. (2019), in which reconnec-
tion seems to take part in. Figure 6 (f) shows that the EUVI 195
Å (∼1.6 MK), 171 Å (∼0.8 MK), and 304 Å (∼0.08 MK) light
curves in the dip region peak at 17:58 UT, 18:09 UT, and 19:15

UT, respectively. This indicates that coronal plasma in the dip re-
gion is cooling, as often observed in the process of prominence
formation (e.g., Berger et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012) and coronal
rain formation (e.g., Mason et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; Kohutova
et al. 2019; Antolin 2020).

The AIA observations show that similar condensation pro-
cesses repeatedly take place near regions A and B, resulting in
episodes of on-disk quiescent coronal rain events (e.g., Antolin
et al. 2012b; Li et al. 2021a). Figure 7 and its associated on-
line animation present AIA observations for one episode of such
coronal condensation. In 131 Å (∼0.6 MK) and 171 Å (∼0.8
MK) images, a localized emission enhancement is ﬁrst detected
around 09:35 UT at the location of (-364(cid:48)(cid:48), 320(cid:48)(cid:48)). This location

(red dots in Fig. 7 (c) and (d)) roughly coincides with a magnetic
dip region in our PFSS extrapolation that will be presented in
Section 4.2 (see Fig. 12 (b)). In 211 Å (∼2.0 MK) and 193 Å
(∼1.6 MK) images, coronal rain clumps resulting from the coro-
nal condensation subsequently appear around 09:50 UT (within
the green eclipse), and then rapidly drain into region B along the
loops. In comparison, the 304 Å passband captures more coro-
nal rain ﬂows during the same period due to its lower formation
temperature (∼0.08 MK). To better illustrate this on-disk con-
densation process, two space-time diagrams were constructed
for the trajectory “S2" shown in Fig. 7 (c). The space-time dia-
grams shown in Fig. 7 (g) reveal that cool materials appear after
a localized enhancement in the AIA 193 Å and 171 Å images.

This enhanced emission is likely caused by a local plasma den-
sity increase in the (magnetic) dip region. To examine whether
coronal condensation occurs, we plotted the temporal evolution
of the AIA 211 Å, 193 Å, 171 Å, 131 Å, and 304 Å intensities in
the condensation site (red box in Fig. 7 (d)). The inverse of the
AIA 304 Å light curve was plotted, as cool materials resulting
from the condensation manifest themselves as dark absorption
features in 304 Å images. As shown in Fig. 7 (f), these light
curves sequentially increase to their peaks at diﬀerent times, and
those with lower characteristic temperatures peak at later times,
indicating the occurrence of coronal condensation due to ther-
mal instability. Considering the fact that the coronal-rain-related
SSDs were also detected in Mg ii lines (see Section 3.2), we can
conclude that the hot coronal plasma in our observations cool
though ∼2.0 MK all the way down to ∼0.01 MK.

3.4. Response of supersonic downﬂows in the sunspot
umbra: localized heating of the chromosphere

As the downﬂows fall into the sunspot umbra at supersonic
speeds, in Hα line core and wing images, we found the appear-
ance of localized brightenings in both regions A and B during
01:00−06:15 UT, i.e, Rasters 2−4. From Fig. 2 (a), we can see
that these chromospheric brightenings only occur at two small
regions (marked by the two arrows) around the footpoints of two
sets of sunspot plumes. Similar brightenings can also be iden-
tiﬁed from the TR images of IRIS SJI 1400 Å, resembling the
TR bright dots or ribbons reported by Kleint et al. (2014). Simi-
lar brightenings have also been reported in previous coronal rain
observations (e.g., Jing et al. 2016; Schad et al. 2021), which
have been attributed to the heating induced by a stationary shock

(e.g., Straus et al. 2015; Chitta et al. 2016; Schad et al. 2021) or
a plasma collision process (Reale et al. 2013; Fang et al. 2015;
Li & Ding 2017).

Through scrutinizing simultaneous the AIA 304 Å image se-
quence, we found that these brightenings only appear as obvious
coronal rain ﬂows falling into the sunspot. Fig. 8 shows the most
prominent SSD-induced bright dot in our observations and its
associated coronal rain, which was observed in region B during
IRIS Raster 4. From the space-time diagrams, we can see obvi-
ous coronal rain ﬂow towards the sunspot since 03:00 UT and
impacts the latter around 03:30 UT. After the drainage of rain
ﬂow into the sunspot, the bright dot promptly appears in the um-
bra and then lives for more than 2 hr with a maximum diameter
(Ddot) of ∼1.5 Mm.

Fig. 9 further shows the multi-wavelength response of this
SSD-induced bright dot. From the Hα line core and wing im-
age sequences, we can see that it ﬁrst appears around 03:26 UT,
and then lasts to 05:04 UT. The long-lived nature of this bright
dot may imply a sustained energy deposition from the associated
SSD events. Apart from that, this bright dot is also detected in
the AIA 1600 Å and 1700 Å images, as well as the intensity map
of the Mg ii triplet line at 2798.809 Å (a blend of 2798.82 Å
and 2798.75 Å). This suggests that the brightening phenomenon
extends to the lower chromosphere or even the temperature min-
imum region. From Fig. 9 (g), we can see that the Mg ii 2798.809
Å line turns into a strong emission feature at the bright dot. Note
that the Mg ii triplet lines (2791.60, 2798.82 Å and 2798.75 Å)
formed in the lower chromosphere usually manifest themselves
as absorption lines in most on-disk observations. They can turn
into emission in case of heating in the lower chromosphere, such

as in ﬂares, UV bursts, or Ellerman bombs (e.g., Peter et al. 2014;
Vissers et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2015, 2016). According to the for-
ward modelling results of Pereira et al. (2015), the core-to-wing
ratio of the Mg ii triplet lines is well correlated to the temperature
increase. In the bright dot, the core-to-wing ratio of Mg ii triplet,
reaches up to 4, indicating a temperature increase by ∼1500 K in
the lower chromosphere (Pereira et al. 2015).

Assuming that SSDs fall downwards into the umbra along
one ﬂux tube and the bright dot occurs at its endpoint, we can
roughly estimate the thermal and kinetic energy ﬂux that pass
through the bright dot. According to (Vernazza et al. 1981), we
assume that the initial chromospheric temperature of the umbra
is around 6.0−7.0 kK in Hα passbands. If the bright dot in the
umbra undergoes a temperature increase by ∼1500 K, its tem-
perature (THα) should reach up to 7.5−8.5 kK. As a result, the
thermal energy ﬂux in the bright dot ( 3
2 nekBTHα · vSSD) can be
estimated as 3.9−4.4 ×105 erg cm−2 s−1, where kB is Boltzmann

constant and ne is the average density of SSDs (∼ 1010.4 cm−3).
On the other hand, the kinetic energy ﬂux of SSDs ( 1
SSD)
2
along the ﬂux tube can be derived as 1.9−3.4×107 erg cm−2 s−1,
which is two orders of magnitude higher than the thermal energy
ﬂux in the bright dot. This suggests that a small portion of the re-
leased kinetic energy from SSDs (or falling coronal rain) is suf-
ﬁcient enough to cause these dot-like localized chromospheric
brightenings.

4.1. Downﬂow speeds in different spectral lines

In Section 3.2., our spectral analysis reveals that the falling coro-
nal rain ﬂows show almost the same speeds (∼95 km s−1) in the
O iv 1400/1401 Å and Si iv 1403 Å lines, but demonstrate a
higher speed (∼135 km s−1) in the Mg ii 2796 Å line. This re-

sult might be explained in terms of the multi-thermal nature of
coronal rain ﬂow or/and the geometry of magnetic structures.
As Antolin (2020) stated, coronal rain ﬂows or blobs are com-
posed of a cool, dense core and a hot, thin envelope, which have a
strong co-spatial emission in chromospheric and TR lines. When
a coronal rain blob falls downward towards the solar surface
from the corona under the gravity, its multi-thermal components
would acquire almost the same speed at a given height due to its
typical small scale of 300 km width and 1 Mm length (Antolin
2020). For the O iv and Si iv lines, they form at temperatures al-
most a factor of two apart, but their emission mainly come from
the enveloping TR sheath around the cool blob, as well as the
wake of the rain and the compressed region ahead of the blob. In
other words, the TR emission of downﬂows should come from
multiple atmospheric layers, eﬀectively reducing their velocity
measurement. Hence, downﬂows in O iv and Si iv lines show
comparable speeds.

The emission of the Mg ii line mainly comes from the cool
inner core of falling rain clumps, so that it gives a more accurate

velocity measurement of downﬂows than that of TR lines. For
falling rain ﬂows, the simulations of Oliver et al. (2016) show
an increase of falling speed with higher density due to the pres-
sure gradient restructuring. Although their simulation result is
still physically unclear, the same mechanism might be operat-
ing here, leading to a higher speed in the Mg ii line. Moreover,
the gravitational acceleration may also play a role here, since the
Mg ii line likely samples plasma cooled and accelerated from
the Si iv- and O iv-emitting plasma at larger heights. Besides, in
sunspot plumes, magnetic ﬁeldlines are usually organized in the
shape of funnels. The cross section of a funnel becomes smaller
when going down from the source region of Si iv to that of Mg ii.
According to Bernoulli’s law, the downﬂow speed in Mg ii would
be higher than in Si iv if its density of does not increase too
much. Using the continuity equation (ρvS = constant, where ρ
is the mass density, S is the cross section.), we can infer that
the ratio of cross section in the TR and chromospheric height is
equal to 14, because the density in the chromosphere should be a
factor of 10 higher than in the TR. This means that the magnetic

ﬁeld strength along the sunspot plumes decreases by about 14
times from the chromosphere up to the TR, due to the magnetic
ﬂux conservation.

4.2. Sunspot supersonic downﬂows: bursty or quasi-steady

It has been long hypothesized that SSDs have an association with
coronal rain or prominence material, due to their coronal origin
and chromospheric properties. However, the existence of long
duration SSD events (over several hours in some cases) and their
sometimes steady spectral character question this hypothesis.
For instance, Straus et al. (2015) argued that the well-known in-
termittency of coronal rain is inconsistent with the stable spectral
nature of such long-lived steady SSDs. To date, despite that sev-
eral previous observations have demonstrated that bursty SSDs
result from impulsive coronal rain (Kleint et al. 2014; Ishikawa
et al. 2020), the long-lived steady SSDs have rarely be attributed
to coronal rain.

In our observations, almost all the identiﬁed SSDs appear at
the footpoints of sunspot plumes and are temporally associated
with episodes of coronal rain. Interestingly, the coronal-rain-
induced SSDs we detected in the 5th raster of IRIS (as shown
in Figs. 4 (b1)-(b3)) appear as a secondary redshifted emission
peak, which remains relatively stable between 18:55 UT to 19:30
UT in both TR lines and Mg ii k. Such long-lived and stable spec-

Article number, page 10 of 16

tral character is very similar to that in (Tian et al. 2014; Straus
et al. 2015). Hence, our current results provide strong evidence
that steady SSDs can also be induced by falling coronal rain
ﬂows. We also notice that in a coronal-rain related SSD event in
(Ishikawa et al. 2020), falling rain ﬂows simultaneously result in
steady SSD spectra in TR lines and bursty SSD spectra in chro-
mospheric lines. These observations together support the view
that both bursty and steady SSDs have a common origin: ﬂows
of condensation forming above sunspots due to TNE and/or ther-
mal instability (Antolin 2020).

It is worth noting that in Figs. 4 and 6, condensed materi-
als ﬁrst accumulate as a transient prominence in a newly-formed
magnetic dip region and thus form a mass reservoir available to
feed a continuous and less-clumpy rain ﬂow. Hence, the pres-
ence of magnetic dips should provide a desirable condition for
the formation of steady SSDs (see also Schad et al. 2021). More-
over, given that the coronal rain ﬂows persistently drain into the
sunspot along diﬀerent trajectories in funnel-like magnetic struc-
tures (sunspot plumes), the funnel eﬀect of this magnetic ge-
ometry may further reshape the less-clumpy rain at the coronal
height into a more elongated and stream-like one when reach-
ing the lower atmosphere (Antolin et al. 2015), leading to quasi-
steady redshifted spectral features. In addition, for our case, it
is likely that the diﬀerence of the times when two falling blobs
in the rain reach the sunspot is smaller than the sampling ca-

dence of the IRIS slit, which is about half minute in Raster 5
(for the last slit position). This, together with the long exposure
time (7.9 s), ensures that each exposure of IRIS can capture at
least one falling blob. Consequently, the redshifted component is
present in all exposures of IRIS. Therefore, we suggest that in the
sunspot atmosphere, the appearance of steady or bursty SSDs is
not only regulated by its magnetic ﬁeld topology, but their detec-

tion also depends on the sensitivity and time resolution of IRIS
raster scans.

4.3. Can the coronal condensation provide enough mass to

feed the sunspot supersonic downﬂows?

Apart from their steady spectral character, the mass supply for
long-lived SSD events also needs to be considered. Focusing on
an SSD event observed by IRIS, Straus et al. (2015) derived an
electron density of 1010.6±0.25 cm−3 and a mass ﬂux of 5 × 10−7
g cm−2 s−1. Based on rough calculations, Straus et al. (2015)
and Chitta et al. (2016) argued that such a substantial mass ﬂux
would evacuate the overlying corona on a timescale of ∼100 s to
1000 s without supply of additional mass.

The electron density of ∼ 1010.4 cm−3 and mass ﬂux of 5
× 10−7 g cm−2 s−1 we estimated for the SSD events here are
roughly consistent with previous estimations (Straus et al. 2015;
Samanta et al. 2018; Nelson et al. 2020a). As mentioned above,
the SSD events in our observations are clearly related to repeated
quiescent coronal rain events. In particular, as shown in Section
3.2, the quasi-steady redshifted component detected during IRIS
Raster 5 lasts for at least 35 minutes. Simultaneous STEREO-
A/EUVI observations show that this SSD event is caused by
the drainage of cool plasma originating from the coronal con-
densation at a high-lying (magnetic) dip region. The continuous
drainage lasts for nearly 2 hrs (see Figs. 4 and 5, and their associ-
ated animations), suggesting that the mass supply from coronal
rain ﬂows should be enough to sustain a long-lived SSD event.

To quantify the mass supply, we further estimated the con-
densation rate. Following Liu et al. (2012), we assumed that
the EUVI 304 Å emission of coronal rain mainly comes from
the prominence-corona TR (PCTR) surrounding the condensa-
tion clumps. Accordingly, using the typical electron density of a
PCTR (8 × 109 cm−3), we obtained a mass density ( 1.2nemp) of
1.5 × 10−14 cm−3 (considering the He abundance and assuming
a fully ionised plasma (Yang et al. 2020)). Next, focusing on the

Article number, page 12 of 16

dip region outlined by the white box shown in Fig. 10 (a), we
computed the apparent areas (Acond) of condensation at diﬀer-
ent times using EUVI 304 Å images taken during 16:56 −19:26
UT. This was achieved by identifying image pixels where the in-
tensity is higher than 1σ above the median intensity in the dip
region. As shown in Figs. 10 (a1)-(a2), this threshold ensures
that we can separate and identify all brightest pixels covering
condensation region from the noisy background. In addition, we
assumed that there is no overlap between diﬀerent condensation
clumps in the LOS. Using the observed thickness (∼ 10 arcsec)
of an individual coronal rain ﬂow (see Fig. 10 (a)) as the pos-
sible thickness (Dthick) for the condensation clumps, the instan-
taneous mass of condensation at each time can be calculated as
Minst = 1.2nemp · Acond · Dthick. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), the es-
timated total mass of condensation (Mtotal) in the dip region is
∼1.3 × 1014 g, and the mean condensation rate ( ˙M) is 1.5 × 1010
g s−1. Assuming that the Hα bright dot in region B (see Sec-
tion 3.4) represents the cross section area (Aloop = π · Ddot
) of
4
the related ﬂux tube, we further derived a mass transport rate
( ˙Mtube = Aloop · ∆m) of 0.7 × 1010 − 1.2 × 1010 g s−1. Note
that downﬂows can also be detected in the optically thick 304 Å
channel, thus the Fmass of SSDs we derived from optically thin
lines only gives a lower limit. So the coronal condensation can
supply mass to the SSDs at most for 2.8 − 4.9 hrs ( Mtotal
), consis-
˙Mtube
tent with the observed durations of quasi-steady SSDs (e.g., Tian
et al. 2014; Straus et al. 2015). These estimations reinforce our
suggestion that coronal condensation occurring at a magnetic dip
can provide enough mass to sustain a long-lived SSD event.

concave coronal loops, a weak brightening signal appears at
around 09:35 UT. This indicates possible plasma heating and
evaporation in the reconﬁguration of coronal magnetic ﬁeld
lines, which are thought to be a key condition for the formation
of coronal rain and prominences in numerical simulations (e.g.,
Xia et al. 2014; Fang et al. 2015; Xia & Keppens 2016; Huang
et al. 2021).

Figure 12 further shows several extrapolated ﬁeld lines pro-
jected onto SDO/HMI and STEREO-A/EUVI images. We can
see obvious magnetic dips on the extrapolated high-lying ﬁeld
lines (the blue lines) at two diﬀerent spatial regions where coro-
nal condensation take place (as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 7). For
region A, the related magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is very similar
to the magnetic setting in the reconnection-facilitated conden-
sation scenario proposed by (Li et al. 2018). The higher-lying
curved structures (blue lines) may move downward and recon-
nect with the lower-lying loops (white lines). As a result, two
sets of new magnetic structures (green and yellow lines) form at
opposite sides of the lower-lying loops. The regions separating
these diﬀerent magnetic structures appear as an X-shaped fea-
ture. As suggested in Li et al. (2020), due to the downward mo-
tion of the higher-lying structures, a magnetic dip would form
above the X-shaped structure. For region B, the related magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration is more like the common magnetic setting of
solar prominence/ﬁlament formation in previous numerical sim-
ulations (e.g., Xia et al. 2014; Kaneko & Yokoyama 2017) and
observations (e.g., van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Yang et
al. 2016, 2021; Chen et al. 2018b; Li et al. 2021b). We found
two sets of adjacent magnetic arches (yellow and green lines)
rooted at two opposite-polarity photospheric ﬂux concentrations
(see Figs. 12 (b1)−(b3)). The two ﬂux concentrations are found
to converge and cancel with each other during 09:00 UT−15:00
UT, likely indicating magnetic reconnection. This process results
in the formation of (sheared) overlying loops (blue lines) with a
magnetic dip.

4.5. Interpretation

In Fig. 13, two schematic diagrams are given to explain the
magnetic dip formation, subsequent coronal condensation, and
quasi-steady supersonic downﬂows. The top one supports the
reconnection-facilitated condensation scenario proposed by Li
et al. (2018). In this scenario, magnetic reconnection occurs be-
tween the L1 and L2 ﬁeld lines, resulting in two sets of newly
reconnected loops (L3 and L4) retracting from the reconnection
site. Due to the downward motion, the higher-lying magnetic
structure L1 will curve towards the magnetic null point and a
magnetic dip is formed. As more ﬁeld lines in the L1 structure
move downward and reconnect with L2, a low pressure region
would form around the dip region after episodes of reconnec-
tion. Then plasma will accumulate in the dip region. However,
the bottom one is quite similar to the formation process of ﬁla-
ments/prominences. In this scenario, two sets of loops, L3 and
L4, move together, and their reconnection leads to high-lying
magnetic structures L1 and small lower-lying loops L2. The
newly formed L1 structure naturally has a magnetic dip, pro-
viding a favored site for plasma accumulation.

As plasma gradually accumulates in the dip, the cooling and
condensation of hot plasma would inevitably commence most
likely due to thermal instability. In this course, intensities of
EUV passbands sampling cooler plasma would peak at later
times. Subsequently, cool materials with temperatures of ∼0.01-
0.1 MK would form and ﬁll up the dip, and then slide down
towards the sunspot region along the L1 (and also L3) ﬁeld lines

4.4. How do the magnetic dips form in the high-lying

magnetic structures?

As stated in Section 3.3, the condensation of coronal plasma is
apparent after the appearance of dips in the high-lying coronal
structures, which is very similar to the scenario of reconnection-
facilitated condensation proposed by Li et al. (2018). Fig-
ure 11 and its associated online animation present the topologi-
cal changes of the coronal loop system in the course of conden-
sation. In Figure 11 (c) and (d), one can notice that groups of
downward-concave coronal loops are continuously created near
an X-shaped structure during 03:50 −05:30 UT. Subsequently,
coronal rain appears along the upward-moving coronal loops and
rapidly slides into the sunspot region, although we should note
that not all the coronal rain here is coming from the localized
condensation in dips but partly from overlying (closed) loops and
nearby prominences. These EUV observations indicate that the
formation of the dips is indeed closely related to the reconﬁgura-
tion of coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines near the X-shaped structure.
Unfortunately, the low-cadence EUVI observations do not allow
us to investigate the detailed reconﬁguration process.

We thus reconstructed the coronal magnetic ﬁeld structures
using a potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS) model (Schatten
et al. 1969). As shown in the Figure 11 (a) and (b), the re-
constructed X-shaped structure roughly agrees with the global
topological morphology observed in the EUVI 195 Å running-
diﬀerence image at around 09:35 UT, in which obvious magnetic
dips exist along the downward-concave coronal loops above the
X-shaped structure. Note that near the left leg of the downward-

due to the gravity. As a result, from the STEREO-A viewing an-
gle, the drainage of cool materials would be observed as oﬀ-limb
quiescent coronal rain activity. While from the Earth viewing an-
gle, the falling cool plasma would be detected as spectral signa-
tures of SSDs near the footpoints of sunspot plumes by IRIS.

Even though the magnetic dip may originate from two dif-
ferent reconnection processes, our observations strongly sup-
port that reconnection facilitates the formation of magnetic dips.
These two scenarios may diﬀerentiate each other mainly by the
motion of the high-lying ﬁeld lines. In the former scenario, there
should be ﬁeld lines moving down towards the X-point, while
in the latter the ﬁeld lines should move up (as inferred from
the apparent motion of coronal structures). Both the upward and
downward motion of the high-lying ﬁeld lines can be seen in the
animations of Figure 6 and Figure 11, respectively. Moreover,
in the ﬁrst scenario of Fig. 13, cool materials resulting from the
condensation can also slide towards the sunspot region along the
newly-formed loops L3. A similar feature was indeed observed
in our case (see Figs. 6 and 8). Therefore, any of this two scenar-
ios cannot be ruled out with current observations.

5. Conclusions

We have conducted a case study on the origin of sunspot su-
personic downﬂows (SSDs) based on joint spectroscopic and
imaging observations with multiple instruments. We found that
almost all the identiﬁed SSDs in IRIS raster scans appear at
the footpoints of sunspot plumes and are temporally associated

Article number, page 14 of 16

with episodes of dot-like chromospheric heating events inside
the sunspot umbra. In IRIS spectra, these fast downﬂows can be
simultaneously detected as secondary emission peaks in several
transition region and chromospheric lines. The average density,
Doppler velocity and mass ﬂux of these SSDs are of the order of
1010.4 cm−3, 100 km s−1 and 5 × 10−7 g cm−2 s−1, respectively.
Our dual-perspective EUV imaging observations reveal that a
large-scale closed magnetic loop system spans from remote re-
gions to the sunspot region, in which repeated coronal rain form
at diﬀerent regions and ﬂow towards the sunspot, thus causing
these SSDs.

In particular, a well-observed coronal condensation in the 5th
raster of IRIS occurs in a magnetic dip region that newly forms
as a result of magnetic reconnection. With the presence of this
dip region, cool material that condensed from the hot corona
accumulates as a transient prominence, which thus serves as a
desirable mass provider and results in a long-lived steady SSD
event via a long-lasting continuous rain ﬂow. The SSD-related
drainage of coronal rain and the coronal rain-induced chromo-
spheric heating both last for more than 2 hrs, suggesting a sub-
stantial mass supply by the coronal condensation. The estimated
total mass of condensation (1.3 × 1014 g) and condensation rate
(1.5 × 1010 g s−1) have been found to be large enough to sus-
tain a quasi-steady SSD event, which has a mass transport rate of

dot in (b) marks the location of the magnetic dip, which is also shown in Fig. 7.

ing of Li et al. (2018) and Mason et al. (2019), our observations
support that apart from the thermal evolution in the coronal mag-
netic structures, the magnetic topological evolution also plays a
vital role in the onset of coronal condensation.

Our observations cannot exclude the possibility that siphon
ﬂows may also feed SSDs. Future investigations should be con-
ducted to examine this possibility. Statistical studies should also
be performed to investigate how common this reconnection-
facilitated condensation is for the origin of SSDs.

Fig. 13. Two possible scenarios for the magnetic dip formation, sub-
sequent coronal condensation, and supersonic downﬂows. The “+" and
“-" signs denote the positive- and negative- polarity magnetic ﬁelds on
the solar surface, and the solid lines represent magnetic ﬁeld lines. Near
the reconnection site (red explosive feature), four groups of ﬁeld lines,
“L1", “L2", “L3" and “L4", are highlighted by green and blue solid
lines. The grey arrows indicate the converging motion of existing loops
to the reconnection site, while the red arrows mark the diverging motion
of newly formed loops from the reconnection site. The brown shadowed
regions represent coronal rain clumps. Note that “L4" in the top panel
and “L2" in the bottom panel may also exhibit coronal rain.
