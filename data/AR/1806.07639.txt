Abstract

A non-linear equation obtained by adding gravitational self-interaction terms to the Poisson
equation for Newtonian gravity is here employed in order to analyse a static spherically sym-
metric homogeneous compact source of given proper mass and radius and the outer vacuum.
The main feature of this picture is that, although the freedom of shifting the potential by an ar-
bitrary constant is of course lost, the solutions remain qualitatively very close to the Newtonian
behaviour. We also notice that the negative gravitational potential energy is smaller than the
proper mass for sources with small compactness, but for sources that should form black holes
according to General Relativity, the gravitational potential energy becomes of the same order
of magnitude of the proper mass, or even larger. Moreover, the pressure overcomes the energy
density for large values of the compactness, but it remains ﬁnite for ﬁnite compactness, hence
there exists no Buchdahl limit. This classical description is meant to serve as the starting point
for investigating quantum features of (near) black hole conﬁgurations within the corpuscular
picture of gravity in future developments.

Introduction

It is well-known that Newtonian gravity can be recovered from General Relativity in the weak
ﬁeld and non-relativistic regime [1]. It was also shown long ago that General Relativity is in turn
the simplest among the (diﬀeomorphism invariant) consistent completions of the linear Newtonian
gravity with the graviton self-coupling [3]. This can be more easily demostrated in the ﬁrst order
Palatini formalism, in which the metric g and the connection Γ are initially treated as independent

variables. The relation that makes Γ compatible with the metric is then derived and contains the
inverse of g, which makes it apparent why this completion is essentially non-perturbative. Later on,
it was shown [4] that there in fact exists a larger class of Lorentz invariant theories for interacting
massless gravitons which are consistent with quantum physics (see also Refs. [5–7]).

In the present work we wish to tackle a much more modest task than recovering classical General
Relativity and all of its fundamental symmetries, namely we will study an eﬀective equation for
the gravitational potential of a static source which contains a gravitational self-interaction term
besides the usual coupling with the matter density. Following an idea from Ref. [8], this equation
was derived in details from a Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian in Ref. [9], and it can therefore be viewed
as stemming from the truncation of the fully relativistic theory at some “post-Newtonian” order
(for the standard post-Newtonian formalism, see Ref. [10]). The main motivation for this study is
provided by the quantum model of corpuscular black holes [11], in which the constituents of black
holes are assumed to be gravitons marginally bound in their own gravitational potential well. The
typical size of this well is given by the characteristic Compton-de Broglie wavelength λG ∼ RH,
where 1

is the Schwarzschild (gravitational) radius of the black hole of mass M , and whose depth is propor-
tional to the very large number

of soft quanta in this condensate. When the contribution of gravitons is related to the necessary
presence of ordinary matter, the picture appears connected to the post-Newtonian approximation [8].
This can be seen by considering that the (negative) gravitational energy of a source of mass M
localised inside a sphere of radius R is given by

UN ∼ M VN ∼ −

(1.3)

where VN ∼ −GN M /R is the (negative) Newtonian potential. This potential can be represented by
the expectation value of a scalar ﬁeld over a coherent state |g(cid:105), whose normalisation then yields the
graviton number (1.2), which reproduces Bekenstein’s area law [12]. In addition to that, assuming
most gravitons have the same wave-length λG, the (negative) energy of each single graviton is
correspondingly given by

which yields the typical Compton-de Broglie length λG ∼ R. The graviton self-interaction energy

1We shall mostly use units with c = 1 and the Newton constant GN = (cid:96)p/mp, where (cid:96)p is the Planck length and

mp the Planck mass (so that (cid:126) = (cid:96)p mp).

and the fact that gravitons in a black hole are marginally bound is reﬂected by the “maximal
packing” condition [11], which roughly reads UN + UGG (cid:39) 0 for R = RH [8, 9, 13].

The above quantum picture was previously tested by studying small (post-Newtonian) pertur-
bations around the Newtonian potential in Ref. [9]. However, since the post-Newtonian correction
VPN ∼ 1/r2 is positive and grows faster than the Newtonian potential near the surface of the source,
one is allowed to consider only matter sources with radius R (cid:29) RH for this approximation to hold.
This consistency condition clearly excludes the possibility to study very compact matter sources
and, in particular, those on the verge of forming a black hole, that is with R (cid:39) RH. For the ultimate
purpose of including such cases, we shall here study the non-linear equation of the eﬀective theory
derived in Ref. [9] at face value, without requiring that the corrections it introduces with respect
to the Newtonian potential remain small. We shall nonetheless show that the qualitative behaviour
of the complete solutions to our non-linear equation resembles rather closely the Newtonian coun-
terpart. This result, which essentially stems from including a gravitational self-interaction in the
Poisson equation, is what we call “bootstrapping” the Newtonian gravity.

The paper is organised as follows:

in the next Section we brieﬂy review the derivation of the
eﬀective equation for the gravitational potential obtained by including a potential self-interaction;
in Section 3, we ﬁnd the exact solution in the vacuum and, in Section 4, we analyse the case
of a homogenous spherical source; a possible connection with the corpuscular model and future
perspectives are then discussed in the concluding Section 5.

2 Eﬀective theory for the gravitational potential

We shall start by brieﬂy recalling the main steps in the derivation of the non-linear equation which
reproduces the Newtonian potential to leading order and includes the eﬀects of gravitational self-
interaction obtained in Ref. [9]. First of all, one assumes the local curvature is small, so that the
metric can be written as gµν = ηµν + hµν, where ηµν is the ﬂat Minkowski metric with signature
(−, +, +, +) and |hµν| (cid:28) 1. In addition to this weak ﬁeld limit, we must assume that all matter
in the system moves with a characteristic velocity much slower than the speed of light in the
(implicitly) chosen reference frame xµ = (t, x). In fact, we shall just consider (static) spherically
symmetric systems, so that ρ = ρ(r) and the only relevant component of the metric is therefore
h00(r) ≡ −2 V (r). In this approximation, the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with matter reduces to

where f (cid:48) ≡ df /dr. The corresponding equation of motion is just the Poisson equation,

≡ (cid:52)V = 4 π GN ρ ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

for the Newtonian potential V = VN.

In order to go beyond the Newtonian approximation, we modify the latter functional by adding

a non-linear term. This term can be obtained by noting that the Hamiltonian

the above UN as given by the interaction of the matter distribution enclosed in a sphere of radius r

Finally, the Euler-Lagrange equation for V is thus given by

(1 − 4 qΦ V ) ((cid:52)V − 4 π GN ρ) = 2 qΦ

(cid:0)V (cid:48)(cid:1)2 ,

(2.7)

where qΦ is a self-coupling parameter. In particular, it was shown in Ref. [9] that the ﬁrst post-
Newtonian expansion of the Schwarzschild metric is recovered for qΦ = 1, and we shall therefore
assume this value in the following (we will brieﬂy come back to this point in the Conclusions).

In the next sections, we shall analyse Eq. (2.7) as an eﬀective description of the static gravi-
tational ﬁeld V generated by a static source of density ρ in ﬂat space-time. In other words, we
abandon, or disregard, its geometric origin given by the Einstein-Hilbert action and proceed by
assuming there exists a reference frame in which the motion of test particles are described by New-
ton’s law with a potential that solves Eq. (2.7). Before we try and solve this equation, it is then
important to note that the freedom to shift the Newtonian potential by an arbitrary constant, say
V0, is now lost in general. In fact, if Vc solves Eq. (2.7), for any ¯V = Vc + V0 one ﬁnds

[1 − 4 (Vc + V0)] ((cid:52)Vc − 4 π GN ρ) − 2 (cid:0)V (cid:48)

(2.8)
which therefore means that ¯V would still be a solution only if Vc = VN. This property clearly
parallels General Relativity. We however note that Eq. (2.6) does not yet contain the pressure as
a source, which will have to be added in order to ensure energy conservation in general, as we will
comment more extensively in Section 5.

(cid:1)2 = −4 V0 ((cid:52)Vc − 4 π GN ρ) ,

c

On a qualitative ground, one might expect that the term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.7) becomes less
important for Vc negative and large, and one approximately recovers the Poisson equation (2.2) in
this case. We shall in fact see that the solution to Eq. (2.7) can be conveniently expressed as a
(somehow small) perturbation about the Newtonian potential where ρ (cid:54)= 0. On the other hand,
in the vacuum ρ = 0 and the eﬀect of the new gravitational self-coupling in Eq. (2.7) leads to
(possibly) signiﬁcant departures from the Newtonian behaviour.

In the vacuum, where ρ = 0, Eq. (2.7) with qΦ = 1 reads

where c1 and c2 are integration constants, and we note again that that one cannot shift Vc by an

The two integration constants can still be ﬁxed by requiring the expected Newtonian behaviour
in terms of the ADM mass [15] M for large r. One must then have c1 = 1 and c2 = 6 GN M , which

a repulsive force for r < 2 GN M . Of course, gravity is attractive and one must view this result as
indicating the post-Newtonian expansion fails at such short distances.

4 Homogeneous ball in vacuum

Since we are interested in compact sources, we will consider the simplest case in which the matter
density is homogeneous and vanishes outside the sphere of radius r = R, that is

where Θ is the Heaviside step function, and

(4.1)

(4.2)

Even with this static and very simple matter density, it is impossible to ﬁnd analytic solutions to
Eq. (2.7), so we shall ﬁrst solve it numerically and then proceed to ﬁnd analytical approximations.
For the numerical solutions, it is useful to introduce dimensionless units by considering the size

R of the source as the reference length, that is we deﬁne

so that Eq. (2.7) for ˜V = V (˜r) reads

As a reference, we shall ﬁrst consider the Newtonian potential for this homogeneous sphere, and
then analyse the diﬀerent regions of space separately for the complete Eq. (2.7).

˜(cid:52) ˜V = 3 ˜M0 Θ(1 − ˜r) .

which ﬁx all of the integration constants and only leave a dependence on ˜M0 = ˜M . The same
boundary conditions are then required for the solution ˜Vc to Eq. (4.4), which we therefore expect
will be uniquely determined by ˜M0.

Some numerical solutions ˜Vc computed for given values of ˜M0 are shown in Fig. 2, where they
are also compared with the corresponding Newtonian potentials (4.9). The main features of the
numerical solutions ˜Vc are that they systematically lie below their Newtonian counterparts ˜VN, but
their shapes are qualitatively very close.

4.3 Analytical approximations

The features found numerically will now guide us to ﬁnd analytical approximations for the interior
of the homogeneous source. First of all, outside the source ρ = 0, and the exact solution (3.3) in
dimensionless units reads

4.3.1

Inside the homogeneous source

Let us next consider the interior of the matter source, that is 0 ≤ ˜r < 1. An exact solution for the
homogeneous density can be found which is however positive everywhere and cannot be used for
describing a ball immersed in an outer vacuum (see Appendix C).

Since it is hard to ﬁnd exact analytical solutions where the density ρ > 0, we ﬁrst write

and assume | ˜W | (cid:28) | ˜VN| for ˜r (cid:39) 0. Upon replacing into Eq. (4.4), we obtain

The accuracy of the above analytical results is compared with the numerical solutions ˜Vn in
Fig. 3, which again shows that the extra source in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.7) acts as a regulator, and

expansion about the Newtonian potential ˜VN holds for any value of ˜VN(0), which is determined by
the constant C in Eq. (4.8). Since the latter is arbitrary, and can only be ﬁxed by matching with
the outer Newtonian potential, the above results show that we can in fact have a solution ˜Vc with
c (0) = 0 and ˜Vc(0) such that it will match the outer solution (3.3) at ˜r = 1.

4.3.2 Matching at the surface

In order to determine the potential for all values of ˜r > 0, we can start from the approximate
solution (4.14) for the interior of the source and match it with the exact outer solution (4.11), at
˜r = 1 (corresponding to r = R). In particular, with ˜VN in Eq. (4.8) and ˜W in Eq. (4.16), continuity
of the potential and of its derivative at ˜r = 1 (see Appendix B) results in the two conditions



(4.18)

for the three parameters ˜M0, ˜M and C. We can thus determine C and ˜M in terms of ˜M0. The
numerical solutions for C and ˜M in the range 1/10 ≤ ˜M0 ≤ 10 are shown in Fig. 4.

Since neglecting ˜W6 does not introduce a large error, we can estimate C and ˜M analytically just

using ˜W (cid:39) ˜W4, so that continuity of the potential at ˜r = 1 reads

From the left panel of Fig. 4, we see that the above estimate of C is just a bit short of the value

(4.25)

obtained from solving Eqs. (4.4) numerically for ˜M0 (cid:39) 1000. This behaviour of C and ˜M is also in
agreement with the fully numerical solutions described in Section 4.2.

It is now important to recall that ˜M0 = GN M0/R (cid:29) 1 corresponds to a source with very large
density, asymptotically approaching a Dirac delta function. On the opposite, ˜M0 = GN M0/R (cid:28) 1
represents a source with small density for which one expects the weak ﬁeld approximation holds.
In the next Section, we will speciﬁcally look at this case.

4.4 Weak ﬁeld regime

The above picture simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly in the weak ﬁeld regime, which was already studied in
Ref. [9]. In fact Eq. (4.4) can be approximated for | ˜V | (cid:28) 1 as

˜(cid:52) ˜VWF (cid:39) 4 π ˜ρ + 2

(4.26)

and the main feature of this equation is that one regains the freedom to shift the potential by an
arbitrary constant, like in purely Newtonian gravity.

In the vacuum, Eq. (4.26) reads

in which two arbitrary integration constants were ﬁxed again by requiring the expected Newtonian

the same as Eq. (3.4) up to, and including order G2
N and the correct post-Newtonian term is again
recovered without any further assumptions. In Fig. 5, we plot the weak ﬁeld solution (4.28) and
compare it to the exact non-linear solution (3.3) and the Newtonian potential for the same value of
the ADM mass. Clearly, the plot is only meaningful for r (cid:29) GN M = 1 (in the units of the graph),
since the condition | ˜VWF| (cid:28) 1 implies that ˜r (cid:29) 2 ˜M .

246810r-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.2V4.5 Pressure and stability

So far we completely neglected the pressure required to have a static conﬁguration at ﬁxed radius
R.
In the following, we will employ a Newtonian argument in order to estimate the necessary
pressure and deduce the corresponding potential energy contribution in a way so as to support the
identiﬁcation of M as the total energy of the system.

4.5.1 Newtonian pressure

It is well know from the Newtonian theory that the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium for the
pressure pN reads [1]

N(r) = −V (cid:48)
p(cid:48)

N(r) ρ(r) = −

GN m(r)
r2

ρ(r) ,

(4.34)

where m = m(r) is the mass contained within a sphere of radius r deﬁned in Eq. (D.2). This equation
can be easily solved for the homogeneous density (4.1) generating the Newtonian potential (4.9)
inside the source. Upon requiring that the pressure vanishes at the surface, pN(R) = 0, the solution
reads

pN(r) =

3 GN M 2

0 (r2 − R2)

8 π R6

.

It is then straightforward to calculate the associated (Newtonian) potential energy as

UBN(r) = BN − 4 π

GN M 2

10 R6

,

(4.35)

(4.36)

where BN is an arbitrary integration constant.

The constant BN can in fact depend on the parameters of our model, like M0 and R.
In
particular, the condition of stability requires that the work done by the pressure pN cancels against
the work done by the gravitational force for an inﬁnitesimal change in the radius R, that is

3 GN M 2

(4.37)

in which we used Eq. (A.3) for the Newtonian potential energy UN = UN(R). This condition yields

BN(M0, R) =

5 R

,

and

UBN(r) =

GN M 2

0 (3 r5 − 5 r3 R2 + 8 R5)

10 R6

,

which ensures that the total energy E of the system

E = M0 + UBN(R) + UN(R) = M0 .

Moreover, it is worth recalling that M0 = M at the Newtonian level, so that E = M .

right), ˜M0 = 2 (bottom left) and ˜M0 = 10 (bottom right).

4.5.2 Post-Newtonian pressure

For the conﬁgurations found in Section 4, we follow the same line of reasoning and simply replace
the Newtonian potential in Eq. (4.34) with the solution Vc, to wit

p(cid:48)(r) = −V (cid:48)

c (r) ρ(r) .

(4.41)

For the potential Vc, we shall employ the analytical approximation (4.14) up to the term W4 in
Eq. (4.16), for which Eq. (4.41) can be solved to obtain
3 GN M 2

0 (R2 − r2){5 R3 + GN M0 [r2 + (1 + 30 C) R2]}

,

(4.42)

p(r) =

40 π R8 (R + 6 C GNM0)

which is very close to the fully numerical result, as shown in Fig. 6.

Like in the Newtonian approximation, upon integrating the above pressure on the volume of the
source, we can obtain the baryonic potential energy UB necessary for the compact object to be in
mechanical equilibrium,

UB(r) =

ensure that M equals the total energy of the system,

E (cid:39) M0 + UG + UB = M .

(4.44)

The cumbersome expression (4.43) simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly if we consider a source with small

compactness, i.e. GN M0/R (cid:28) 1 and C (cid:39) 1 + GN M0/R, which yields

(4.45)

In this low compactness regime, M is given in Eq. (4.21) and UG by the ﬁrst line of Eq. (A.5).
Upon replacing these expressions in Eq. (4.44) then yields

and we ﬁnally end up with

B(M0, R) (cid:39)

(4.47)

As we pointed out in Section 4.3.1, our description let us also consider the opposite regime,
i.e. the case of highly compact sources with GN M0/R (cid:29) 1. The corresponding baryonic potential
energy then reads

UB(R) (cid:39) B(M0, R) −

GN (1 + 21 C) M 2
0
105 C R

(4.48)

(4.49)

We would like to end this section with some remarks about the ratio Γ0 ≡ p(0)/ρ(0). In General
Relativity, it is well known [2] that, for any realistic spherical conﬁguration of matter 2, the pressure
can be positive and non-singular in the origin only if the radius of the source is larger than the
Buchdahl limit, that is for a source of size

R >

9
4

GN M0 ≡ RBL .

(4.50)

This is apparent from the expression of the pressure (D.3) obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppen-
heimer-Volkoﬀ (TOV) equation (D.1) for a homogeneous density. If we instead calculate the above

2Non-outward increasing matter density and vanishing pressure at the surface.

15

ratio for our case using the pressure from Eq. (4.42), also obtained for a homogeneous density, we
ﬁnd

Γ0 =

GN M0
2 R

(cid:20)

1 +

GN M0
5 (R + 6 C GN M0)

(cid:21)

.

For R (cid:39) RBL, and using the value of the constant C from Eq. (4.25), this becomes

Γ0(RBL) (cid:39) 0.22 ,

(4.51)

(4.52)

whereas Γ0 → ∞ in the limit R → 0. This means that the divergence in the pressure that one
encounters for R = RBL in the General Relativistic case has been pushed all the way down to R (cid:39) 0
in our model.

The above result leads us to remark that, although a static object with a uniform density is
just a simple toy model, it can give us hints for more general arguments. For any density proﬁle,
the gravitational force is directed inwards and would collapse the mass towards the centre unless it
were balanced by an equal and opposite pressure. For the homogeneous density we calculated this
necessary pressure without discussing its origin or physical acceptability. In General Relativity, only
for objects with radii larger than the Buchdahl limit, such as stars, this pressure could be provided
by nuclear reactions or the Pauli exclusion principle: below the Buchdahl limit there exists no
density proﬁle which allows for a static conﬁguration. This conclusion could only change if gravity
departs from the General Relativistic description and provides itself an eﬀective pressure directed
outwards, like in the de Sitter space-time. In the corpuscular picture, the gravitons inside black holes
form a Bose-Einstein condensate, whose equation of state resembles that of dark energy [11], and
these gravitons are therefore natural candidates to provide an eﬀective outward pressure. Moreover,
such a large deviation of the ratio Γ0 from General Relativity as the one we found above would
imply that quantum eﬀects have overcome the classical behaviour already at (relatively) large scales
R (cid:39) RBL ∼ GN M0. Of course, one could then argue that this is only acceptable for masses M0
suﬃciently small, say around the Planck scale. However, one could also argue that the diﬀerence
between the bootstrapped Newtonian description and General Relativity should become smaller if
one included higher interaction terms in the Lagrangian (2.6), to the point that this diﬀerence might
become phenomenologically negligible for astrophysical objects. Finally, we also recall that, unlike
what happens in General Relativity, we assumed the potential energy density responsible for the
pressure does not contribute a source term for the potential, and the addition of such a contribution
to the Lagrangian (2.6) might again reduce the diﬀerence with respect to General Relativity.

5 Conclusions and outlook

In the previous sections, we have derived the potential satisfying the non-linear equation (2.7)
generated by a spherically symmetric homogenous compact source. We have also obtained the
necessary pressure (4.42) to keep the conﬁguration static for sources of arbitrarily small radii,
including values below the Buchdahl limit (4.50). Since this pressure turns out to be ﬁnite, unlike
what one expects in General Relativity, it now seems appropriate to come back to our original
motivation for constructing such a “bootstrapped” Newtonian ball and further clarify the possible
connection with the corpuscular picture of black holes that we have mentioned in the Introduction
and at the end of the last Section.

First of all, it is a theorem in General Relativity that, under rather general assumptions, systems
that develop trapping surfaces will collapse into singularities [17]. This is what one expects would

16

happen to a body that shrinks below the Buchdahl limit (4.50). On the other hand, a singularity
is hardly acceptable in the quantum theory, just because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
and one could generically expect that the actual collapse of an astrophysical body will necessarily
deviate from the General Relativistic description at some point. The crucial question is whether such
deviations occur after the horizon has appeared, and they therefore remain hidden forever, or the
quantum eﬀects induce departures from General Relativity outside the gravitational radius which
can therefore be observed. Many works have shown the existence of regular black hole solutions
of modiﬁed gravitational equations which entail no signiﬁcant departures from the corresponding
General Relativistic space-times outside the (outer) horizon (for a review, see Ref. [18]). The
corpuscular picture [11] instead assumes that black holes are fully quantum objects in order to give
a consistent description of the Hawking evaporation and the possibility of observable consequences
should therefore not be excluded.

In order to gain further insight into the above two possibilities, one should not forget about
the matter that collapses and causes the emergence of the black hole geometry. In particular, one
might wonder where this matter ends up in the corpuscular picture [8]. Clearly, if General Relativity
remains a good theory of gravity up to extremely high energy densities, the collapsing matter should
form a tiny ball with essentially no modiﬁcations of physics below the Planck energy scale. In the
quantum corpuscular picture one could instead conceive the possibility that the collapsing matter
occupies (in the quantum mechanical sense of the Compton length) a large volume inside the black
hole and gives rise to an eﬀective gravitational potential that diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the General
Relativistic description. This is precisely the reason we developed the “bootstrapped” Newtonian
picture of a homogeneous source, not to be taken as a model of phenomenological relevance for
compact objects like neutron stars, but as a toy model of gravity tailored to further investigating
It is indeed rather likely that, in order to describe more
this quantum picture of black holes.
accurately astrophysical compact objects, one would need to add more interacting terms to the
Lagrangian (2.6), so that the gravitational potential outside the gravitational radius approaches the
usual post-Newtonian expansion of the General Relativistic Schwarzschild metric.

Although the explicit quantum investigation of the bootstrapped Newtonian ball is left for a
future work, we can here highlight a few relevant features. First of all, we have already noted that
the (exact) vacuum solution Vc in Eq. (3.3) tracks the Newtonian behaviour, and its derivative
therefore gives an attractive force for all (ﬁnite) values of r > 0. This is in clear contrast with the
weak ﬁeld expansion in Eq. (3.4), which instead provides a repulsive force for r ≤ RH = 2 GN M , if
one only includes the ﬁrst post-Newtonian term VPN. In particular, one could apply a Newtonian
argument to Vc and deﬁne the “horizon” as the place where the escape velocity of a particle subjected
to it would equal the speed of light. This occurs for 2 Vc(rH) = −1, which yields

rH =

6 GN M
√
3 − 1
3

(cid:39) 1.4 GN M ,

(5.1)

or rH (cid:39) 0.7 RH. We remark once more that a source of size R this small could not be studied in the
weak ﬁeld expansion to ﬁrst post-Newtonian order, as that approximation does not hold for this
range of the radial coordinate. In fact, it would also violate the Buchdahl limit (4.50) and could
not be a stable conﬁguration according to General Relativity.

Since black holes in General Relativity are regions of empty space with singular sources in the
very centre, we can consider the case of a source with radius R (cid:28) rH. Let us note that, at least for

17

a homogeneous source, we always have M > M0 and Eq. (4.23) then implies that the ratio

(5.2)

for R (cid:28) rH. The area law of black holes [12] states that the mass M should measure the number of
gravitational degrees of freedom, which is also conﬁrmed explicitly by the number of gravitons (1.2)
in the corpuscular picture [11]. The above Eq. (5.2) therefore appears in line with the expectation
that the number of gravitational degrees of freedom should largely overcome the number of matter
degrees of freedom (proportional to M0) in a black hole.

We have already argued in Section 4.5.2 why the mass parameter M of the outer vacuum
solution (3.3) should equal the total energy E of the system. Moreover, the previous considerations
In
naturally lead us to look more closely at the relation between M and the proper mass M0.
particular, if we add the proper energy M0 to the gravitational potential energy UG from Eq. (A.5),
we ﬁnd

(5.3)

where α and β are numerical coeﬃcients of order one, which can be estimated using the two
approximations employed in Eq. (A.5) or computed numerically. We then ﬁnd that the energy
E0G is positive for low compactness sources with GN M0 (cid:28) R, it vanishes for GN M0 (cid:39) 0.6 R and
becomes negative for very compact sources with GN M0 (cid:29) R. For R (cid:39) rH, or

GN M (cid:39) 0.7 rH ,

one can solve the matching conditions (4.18) numerically and ﬁnds

rH (cid:39) 2 GN M0

and C (cid:39) 1.2 .

Moreover, this value of M0 is also close to the case that makes the energy (5.3),

E0G(rH) = M0 + UG(rH) (cid:39) 0 .

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

We shall thus conclude by noting that the vanishing of E0G at (the threshold of) black hole forma-
tion appears as another form of the “maximal packing” condition at the heart of the corpuscular
picture [8,9,11]. In fact, Eq. (5.6) is very close to the form of the maximal packing condition that is
implemented in the quantum harmonic model of corpuscular black holes [16]. Whether this maximal
packing conditions implies that the baryonic matter is completely delocalised inside the horizon like
the gravitons requires a fully quantum treatment of the system and is left for future investigations.

The gravitational energy ˜UG can also be computed numerically for given values of ˜M0, and
compared with the above analytical approximations. From the plot in Fig. 7, it appears that both
approximate expressions reproduce the numerical results fairly well.

B Junction conditions

Because the shift symmetry is lost, we cannot just match the outer potential (3.3) with just any
interior. It is then useful to analyse the matching conditions at r = R. This can be done as usual
by integrating Eq. (2.7) on a shell of thickness 0 < 2 (cid:15) (cid:28) R around r = R,

0 =

(cid:90) R+(cid:15)

R−(cid:15)

≡ I1 + I2 + I3 .

For the ﬁrst term we obtain

I1 =

(cid:90) R+(cid:15)

dr (1 − 4 V ) (cid:0)r2 V (cid:48)(cid:1)(cid:48)

R−(cid:15) + 2

(cid:90) R+(cid:15)

If we assume ρ and V do not diverge at r = R, the second term vanishes for (cid:15) → 0,

which is satisﬁed for (cid:15) → 0 if V (cid:48) is continuous across r = R.

C Anti-de Sitter potential?

Eq. (2.7) with the homogeneous density in Eq. (4.1) is solved exactly for 0 ≤ r < R by

which is clearly positive everywhere, and cannot be matched with a negative outer potential at
r = R. This solution could however be considered as a “cosmological” solution similar to the
anti-de Sitter space.

D Comparison with TOV

It is instructive to compare our result (4.42) for the pressure with the expectation obtained by
solving the TOV equation for a homogeneous source. The standard TOV equation relating the
pressure and energy density reads [2]

dp(r)

=

[ρ + p(r)] GN

(D.2)

Its solution for the homogeneous density (4.1) can be found in exact form after requiring that
pTOV(R) = 0. This yields

pTOV(r) = ρ(r)

This TOV pressure can easily be compared to our Post-Newtonian result from Eq. (4.42) in the
small compactness regime GN M0 (cid:28) R, that is far from the Buchdahl limit. Considering the ﬁrst
two leading terms, the TOV pressure is approximately equal to

Both the lowest order term of the TOV pressure and the one of the Post-Newtonian pressure are
equal to what one calculates in the Newtonian case (4.35). We can also remark that the next-to-
leading order contributions are much smaller. Therefore, as expected, in this limit the pressure
inside the objects obtained in our model can be well approximated by the Newtonian pressure.

A comparison between the TOV solution and the numerical evaluation of the pressure within
our model is displayed in Fig. 8. The plots also show that the two are in good agreement as long as
the source is suﬃciently less compact than the Buchdahl limit (4.50). This is not surprising, since
the pressure (4.42) remains ﬁnite for any 0 ≤ r < R, whereas pTOV(0) in Eq. (D.3) diverges for
R → R+
