Abstract—Optimal power ﬂow (OPF) is an important tech-
nique for power systems to achieve optimal operation while
satisfying multiple constraints. The traditional OPF are mostly
centralized methods which are executed in the centralized control
center. This paper introduces a totally Distributed DC Optimal
Power Flow (DDCOPF) method for future power systems which
have more and more distributed generators. The proposed
method is based on the Distributed Economic Dispatch (DED)
method and the Distributed State Estimation (DSE) method.
In this proposed scheme, the DED method is used to achieve
the optimal power dispatch with the lowest cost, and the DSE
method provides power ﬂow information of the power system to
the proposed DDCOPF algorithm. In the proposed method, the
Auto-Regressive (AR) model is used to predict the load variation
so that the proposed algorithm can prevent overﬂow. In addition,
a method called constraint algorithm is developed to correct
the results of DED with the proposed correction algorithm and
penalty term so that the constraints for the power system will
not be violated. Different from existing research, the proposed
method is completely distributed without need for any centralized
facility.

I. INTRODUCTION

O PTIMAL Power Flow is a technique used in power

system control center to achieve the optimal operation
under certain constraints. Similar to the economic dispatch
problem, most OPF methods minimize the operating cost of
power systems. Additionally, some power ﬂow related con-
straints are also considered. In conventional OPF methods, the
optimization is usually performed by the centralized control
center. However, in recent years, with the development of
renewable energy and smart grid, power systems become
more and more distributed. For these highly distributed power
systems, it is not efﬁcient to collect all data to one centralized
place for computation. So, the distributed OPF method is
needed for these distributed power systems. Also, with the
distributed OPF method, the communication network of the
power system can be designed as distributed, which is more
robust than centralized communication network.

In this paper, the distributed method is developed with the
DCOPF (DC Optimal Power Flow), which is an OPF method
based on the DC power ﬂow analysis. Compared with ACOPF
(AC Optimal Power Flow), DCOPF provides a good-enough
result for most power system applications with much higher
speed. This paper addresses the DDCOPF problem considering
the line ﬂow constraints. There are some existing papers for

distributed OPF problem. In [1], a distributed OPF algorithm is
developed, in which the alternating direction multiplier method
(ADMM) is used to decompose the optimization problem
into several subproblems. However, in this method, the power
system is required to be divided into several areas, and the cen-
tralized method is still used within each area. So the algorithm
is not completely distributed. On the other hand, only the local
power constraint and voltage limit constraint are considered
in [1], but the constraints related to multiple buses, such as
line ﬂow constraint, are not discussed. It makes the proposed
method in [1] less useful in practice, since many important
problems in OPF are multi-bus problems, e.g., the line ﬂow
constraint and the N-1 contingency problem. Similarly, three
DDCOPF methods based on ADMM are proposed in [2], in
which the power system is also divided into small areas, and
the centralized method is also needed within each areas. The
distributed OPF is also discussed in [3–7] . These papers are
also based on area partitioning method which is not fully
distributed. In [8], the authors proposed a Distributed Security-
Constrained Unit Commitment (DSCUC) which is closely
related to distributed OPF. The paper uses analytical target
cascading (ATC) method to achieve the DSCUC. However,
this method also requires the system to be partitioned into
several sub-areas.

The previous studies show that the totally distributed OPF is
hard to be realized. The reason is that the power ﬂow analysis
is hard to be decomposed since the calculation of power ﬂow
requires the information across the entire power system (or at
least a part of the system). In order to achieve the completely
distributed OPF, a new OPF method is developed in this paper
based on the distributed economic dispatch (DED) method [9]
and the distributed state estimation (DSE) method [10]. In
this scheme, the proposed method includes two algorithms.
One is running in the smart meters and another is executed by
the controllers of the generators. The smart meter algorithm
is based on the DSE algorithm which provides the power
ﬂow information for the generators. The algorithm for the
generators has two parts, i.e., the DED algorithm and the con-
straint algorithm. The DED method is employed to optimize
the generation dispatch in the power system. The constraint
algorithm ensures the optimized results from the DED method
to satisfy the line ﬂow constraints. This paper will mainly
focus on the design of the constraint algorithm and how to
integreate it with the DED method and DSE method to realize
the DCOPF. The constraint algorithm corrects the optimized
results with two approaches. In the ﬁrst approach, called

 
 
 
 
 
 
correction algorithm, the constraint algorithm ﬁrst predicts
the operating point of the power system and then corrects
the movement of the operating point to restrict it within the
feasible region. In the second approach, called penalty term,
if the constraints are already violated, the algorithm will use
a penalty term to pull the operating point back to the feasible
region. Since the DED and DSE methods are totally distributed
approaches, and the constraint algorithm has no requirement
for the centralized facilities, then the proposed OPF method
is completely distributed.

The major contributions of this paper are listed as follows:
• This paper proposes a totally distributed OPF method
which has never been realized before. In comparison,
distributed OPF methods reported in existing literature are
not truly distributed, since the centralized method is still
utilized inside each region or area of the power system.
• Compared to the local constraints in the previous papers
[1, 9], the multi-bus constraints, i.e., the line ﬂow con-
straint, in the OPF problem is considered in our paper.
So, the proposed method is much more useful in practice
than the previous methods.

• The basic concept of the proposed constraint algorithm is
to restrict the operating point of the power system within
the feasible region so that the line ﬂow constraints can be
satisﬁed. This idea can be adopted in future distributed
OPF method with the consideration of other constraints,
e.g., contingency constraints [11].

This paper is organized as follows: In section II, the prelim-
inary knowledge about the DED method and the DSE method
are presented. In section III, the DDCOPF method is proposed.
At the ﬁrst part of this section, the framework of the proposed
DDCOPF method is presented. In order to prevent the overﬂow
in the transmission lines, the new method to predict and check
the overﬂow in power system is developed based on AR model
in subsection III-B. Then, the correction algorithm and penalty
term are introduced in the following subsections. In section
IV, two simulation cases to verify the proposed DDCOPF
method in a 39-bus test system are provided. Finally, section
V concludes this paper and introduces future work.

II. PRELIMINARY

A. Distributed Economic Dispatch [9]

Economic dispatch (ED) is a method to optimize the gener-
ation assignment of generators to reach the lowest operational
cost of the power system. The DED is a method to realize
the economic dispatch in a distributed manner. Suppose that
there are totally nb buses in the power system, ml transmission
lines linking those buses, and ng generator buses (Assuming
that each generator bus has one generator. But the conclusion
will not change if there are multiple generators or loads on
the bus). The ED problem can be described as follows [11],

2

where Pg,i is the power reference of generator i. Fi(Pg,i) is
the cost function of the ith generator. Pload is the total load
in the power system. Ploss is the power system’s loss. P min
and P max
are the lower and upper active power output limits
of the generator i, respectively. Typically, the generation cost
function in (1a) is a quadratic function as following,

g,i

g,i

Fi(Pg,i) = αi + βiPg,i + γiP 2
g,i

(2)

where αi, βi and γi are the coefﬁcients of the cost function
for the ith generator.

According to the ED method, assuming that Pg,i is within
the limits, the optimal solution of the objective function can
be obtained by setting the references of the generators such
that the incremental cost of all generators are equal,

dFi(Pg,i)
dPg,i

= λ

, for i = 1, 2, ..., ng

(3)

where λ is the Lagrange multiplier.

Based on paper [9], in a distributed system, the Lagrange
multiplier (or incremental cost) can be calculated by the
following DED algorithm,

λi(k) = λi(k−1) + dλi(k)

(4a)

dλi(k) = τ

(4d)

(4e)

where λi(k) is the estimated Lagrange multiplier on ith gener-
ator at time k. τ is the time interval between two iterations. wij
is a weight between buses i and j determining the convergence
speed. Kpi is the proportional gain and Kii is the integral
gain. fi(k) is the frequency measured by the ith generator at
time k. f0 is the rated frequency (60Hz or 50Hz).

the consensus protocol

As shown in (4a) and (4b),

is
employed to drive the estimated Lagrange multipliers of all
generators to a certain value, which results in an optimal
condition. In addition, equations (4c, 4d, 4e) behave like a
PI frequency controller to ensure that the power balance con-
straint (1b) is satisﬁed. Finally, for the output constraint (1c),
the generation reference can be limited when the reference is
calculated with the Lagrange multiplier as follows,

B. Distributed State Estimation [10]

In traditional power system, state estimation is a widely
implemented technique [11–13] which is usually performed by
a centralized facility, e.g. SCADA (Supervisory Control And
Data Acquisition). The distributed state estimation is a method
to estimate the states of power systems without centralized

information propagation algorithm is proposed in paper [10]
as follows,

˙xi(k) = I 0

where I 0
is a n × n diagonal matrix whose diagonal el-

measurement data, from the ith node.

i.e. I 0

According to the information propagation algorithm (6), the
distributed state estimation algorithm is developed in [10] as
shown in the equations (7),

where Zi(k) denotes the estimated measurement values of all
the nodes in the system by the node i at time k. ˆθi(k) is the
estimated state values on the node i at time k. R and H are
the covariance matrix and the observation matrix, respectively.
The ﬁrst equation (7b) in the algorithm describes the input
of the algorithm, where Z ′
i(k) is a modiﬁcation of Zi(k)
whose ith entry is replaced by the local measurement zi,i(k)
at time k. The equation (7c) is the information propagation
algorithm with weight coefﬁcient wZ
ij . In addition, the equation
(7d) represents the distributed estimation with least square
method [10, 14]. The initial values of the algorithm are:
Zi,i(0) = zi,i(0); Zi,j(0) can be arbitrary number (e.g. zero),
where Zi,j(k) denotes the jth entry of the vector Zi(k).

III. PROPOSED APPROACH

In the proposed distributed OPF method, the power system
has two networks: the power network and the communication
network. The power network connects the loads and genera-
tors together with the transmission lines. The communication
network links all the generator controllers together, and also
connects all
the smart meters together. In addition, each
generator controller connects to a smart meter (or, a smart
meter can be installed as a part of the controller) to obtain
the power ﬂow information. In the proposed scheme,
the
DSE algorithm runs on the smart meters, and the proposed
DDCOPF algorithm is executed on the generator controllers.

A. The idea and framework of the DDCOPF

In the OPF problem, the optimization considers not only the
economic dispatch problem with the power balance constraint
(1b) and the generation limit constraint (1c), but also some
power ﬂow related constraints. For example, this paper focuses
on the line ﬂow limit constraints (8) as follows [12],

1
xij

|θi − θj| ≤ P max

ij

,

for i, j = 1, 2, ..., nb; i 6= j

(8)

3

where xij is the reactance between bus i and bus j. θi and θj
are the voltage phase angles on the bus i and j, respectively.
P max
is the power ﬂow limit for the transmission line between
ij
bus i and bus j. According to the DC power ﬂow [15], the
constraint (8) for the entire power system can also be written
in the vector form,

|Pf | = |Hθ| =

H(B′)−1P

≤ P max
f

(9)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

where Pf is the vector of the line ﬂow in the power system.
P max
is the vector of line ﬂow limits. H is the matrix to
f
convert the phase angle values to the power ﬂow values. θ
and P are the vectors of phase angles and nodal injections for
buses 2, 3, ..., nb, respectively. B′ is called “B-prime” matrix,
which transfers the phase angles into the power injection [11].
Since bus 1 is the reference bus and its phase angle is always
zero, the B′ matrix does not include the row and column for
bus 1, so the impact of power injection at bus 1 cannot be
directly calculated with the B′ matrix. Therefore a new matrix
T is used in this paper to calculate the power ﬂow. The T is
constructed as

Now, the inequality constraint (9) becomes,

(12)

To solve the DDCOPF problem, the DED method [9] is
employed in this paper to constantly update the solution of the
ED problem (1) to approach the optimal dispatch. However,
the constraint (12) deﬁnes a feasible region for the solution
of the DDCOPF problem. In order to keep the constraint (12)
being satisﬁed, the DDCOPF should limit the solution Pg of
the DED algorithm within the feasible region. In this paper, a
line ﬂow constraint algorithm (as shown in Fig.1) is proposed
to correct the solution of the DED method, so that the ﬁnal
solution of the DDCOPF is restricted in the feasible region.

According to Fig.1, at the ﬁrst, the information from the
DED algorithm and DSE algorithm are adopted to predict the
line ﬂows of the next step in the power system and determines
whether there will be overﬂow. If no potential overﬂow in
the power system, the generation references calculated by the
DED algorithm is directly applied on the generators. However,
If overﬂow will happen on any line, the correction algorithm

4

Fig. 1. The ﬂow chart of the proposed constraint algorithm

will be performed to correct the references of the generators to
prevent the overﬂow. In addition, if the overﬂow has already
happened in the system, a penalty term will be added to the
references to reduce the line ﬂow. In the following subsections,
the different parts in the framework in Fig.1 will be described.

According to (5), the ﬁnal result of the generation reference
is computed based on the Lagrange multiplier λi(k). So,
for the controller of the jth generator, the update of the
generation reference ∆P j
g,i(k) of the ith generator can be
estimated by (15) with its local Lagrange multiplier λj (k),
since λj(k) = λi(k) after the consensus protocol is converged.

B. Line Flow Prediction and Overﬂow Checking

This section discusses the method to predict and check the
overﬂow in the power system. The method is based on the
DC power ﬂow model, and the Auto-Regressive (AR) model
is adopted for the load prediction.

In the DC power ﬂow model, due to the linearity, the load
buses and the generator buses in the power system can be
considered separately as follows,

Pf = Hθ = HT P = H(TgPg + TLPL)

(13)

where Pg and PL are the power injection vector of the
generator buses and load buses, respectively. Tg is a matrix
constructed according to (10) but with only the generator
buses. Similarly, TL is developed by considering only the load
buses.

Before the time step k, the prediction for the line ﬂow at

time k can be made by (14).

Pf (k) =H (θ(k − 1) + ∆θ(k))

Therefore, by storing the parameters βi and γi

for
i = 1, 2, ...ng in each generator controller,
the predic-
tion of the generation reference update vector ∆Pg(k) =
[∆P j
g,ng (k)] can be obtained by the
equation (15). Note that the notation ∆Pg(k) here is a vector
for the jth generator. But, since the equation is the same for
all controllers and for the sake of simplicity, the superscript j
is omitted.

g,2(k); ...; ∆P j

Now, let’s consider the prediction of the load variation
∆PL(k). There are many methods to predict the load in power
system [16, 17]. In this paper, an Auto-Regressive (AR) model
of order 2 is used to predict the load variation as follows,

(14)

∆PL(k) = ϕ1∆PL(k−1) + ϕ2∆PL(k−2)

(16)

The power ﬂow Pf (k −1) at the previous step can be obtained
from the DSE algorithm. So, the object is to predict the update
of the power injection vector ∆Pg(k) and ∆PL(k).

The update of the generation reference vector ∆Pg(k)
can be obtained from the result of DED algorithm. In (4b),
the update of the Lagrange multiplier dλi(k) is calculated.

the parameters ϕ1 and ϕ2 can be calculated based on historical
data of ∆PL(t) by Least Square method in (17),

where Hv(k) is the matrix related to the lines which will
violate the constraint, and it is deﬁned as follows,

Hv(k) = Diag([OF1(k), OF2(k), ..., OFml (k)]) · H (20)

In (19), since ∆Pg(k) is the adjusted update for the DED
solution which should be calculated, the equation (19) can be
rewritten into the nonhomogeneous form as follows,

Hv(k)Tg∆Pg(k) = −Hv(k)TL∆PL(k)

(21)

Because Hv(k)Tg is usually not a full ranked square matrix,
the solution cannot be simply computed by its inverse. So,
according to linear algebra [18], the solutions of this non-
homogeneous equation are the sum of a particular solution
∆P η
g (k) of the corresponding nonhomogeneous equation and
the general solutions ∆P ζ
g (k) of the homogeneous equation
Hv(k)Tg∆Pg(k) = 0. Here, by equation (21), it is convenient
to consider that the particular solution ∆P η
g (k) is to counteract
the effect of the load variation ∆PL(k) on the line ﬂow.
Then, the solution ∆P ζ
g (k) of the homogeneous equation is
the desired power reference update for the power system with
constant loads.

First, let us solve the particular solution ∆P η

g (k) of the
nonhomogeneous equation. Since the particular solution is
to neutralize the effect of the loads, the difference (if it is
not zero) between the left-hand side (the line ﬂow caused by
generators) and the right-hand side (the line ﬂow caused by
loads) of the equation (21) is required to be minimized. In
other words, the solution should be the least square solution.
Also,
is better to minimize the norm of the solution
∆P η
g (k), so that the result is more energy efﬁcient. Therefore,
the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse [19] is used to solve the
particular solution ∆P η
g (k) as in (22), since it gives the least
square solution with minimal norm.

it

∆P η

g (k) = −(Hv(k)Tg)+Hv(k)TL∆PL(k)

(22)

where ∆PL(k) comes from the prediction (16). The super-
script notation (∗)+ denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
Next, let us consider the general solution of the homoge-
neous equation Hv(k)Tg∆Pg(k) = 0. It is true that all the
solutions of the homogeneous equation form the kernel of the
matrix Hv(k)Tg. Since the kernel is a subspace of the Rng , it
is possible to ﬁnd a basis that spans the kernel. Suppose that
a basis matrix Mb is deﬁned in which its column vectors are
the basis of the kernel, and the coordinates for the vectors in
the kernel are denoted by X. Because any vector in the kernel
satisﬁes the homogeneous equation, then X can be any value.
Note that the matrices Mb and X are related to Hv(k), hence
they are not constant value, i.e. Mb(k) and X(k). Therefore,
the general solution of the homogeneous equation is,

∆P ζ

g (k) = Mb(k)X(k)

So, the homogeneous equation becomes,

Hv(k)TgMb(k)X(k) = 0

(23)

(24)

As discussed above, the homogeneous equation describes
the power system with constant loads, thus the change of

Fig. 2. The correction of the power reference update vector

By the AR model, the prediction ∆PL(k) can be made by
(16) with the previous updates ∆PL(k − 1) and ∆PL(k − 2),
whose previous updates are provided by the DSE algorithm.
After the prediction of generation reference update ∆Pg(k)
and prediction of load variation ∆PL(k) are obtained, the
prediction for the line ﬂow Pf (k) can be calculated by (14).
Then, the overﬂow in the power system can be checked, and
the results are put in a column vector OF (k) whose each entry
is deﬁned by,

OFu(k) =

1, Pf,u(k) ≥ P max
0, otherwise

f,u

(

(18)

where OFu(k) is the uth entry of the vector OF (k) at time k;
u = 1, 2, ..., ml. Pf,u(k) is the line ﬂow in the line u at time
k. P max

is the maximal line ﬂow allowed for the line u.

f,u

C. Correction of Power References Update ∆P ∗
g

According to Fig.1, the power references of the generators
calculated by the DED algorithm are directly output if the
prediction shows no overﬂow in the power system in the
next step. However, if any overﬂow will happen, the power
references should be adjusted to avoid the violation of the line
ﬂow constraint. In this section, a method to correct the power
references is proposed to make the solution of the DDCOPF
stay within the feasible region.

Since the power balance constraint (1b) and the output limit
constraint (1c) are already satisﬁed by the DED algorithm, the
correction algorithm in this section should adjust the result
of the DED algorithm to meet the line ﬂow constraint (12).
Assuming that the current solution Pg(k − 1) of the DED
algorithm is inside the feasible region but near the boundary
as shown in Fig. 2. If the line ﬂow prediction (14) shows
that the constraint (12) will be violated at time k, i.e. the
solution Pg(k) will be out of the feasible region, then it is
necessary to adjust the update ∆Pg(k) of the DED solution to
prevent the further increasing of the power ﬂow on the lines,
denoted by Pf,v(k), which will be overﬂowed according to
the prediction. This adjustment can be realized by letting the
increment ∆Pf,v(k) to be zero as follows,

∆Pf,v(k) = Hv(k) (Tg∆Pg(k)+TL∆PL(k)) = 0

(19)

line ﬂow is only related to the generation. Since the object
is to correct the original power reference updates to meet the
requirement, it is necessary to preserve as much information
from the original solution ∆Pg(k) as possible, and also satisfy
the homogeneous equation (24). So, it is natural to use Least
Square method to ﬁnd the solution X in which the corrected
vector ∆P ζ
g (k) is closest to the original vector ∆Pg(k) and is
in the kernel. According to the the equation (23), the Least
Square solution is,

∆P ζ

g (k) = Mb(k)(M T

b (k)Mb(k))−1M T

b (k)∆Pg(k)

(25)

Now, as the particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equa-
tion and the Least Square solution of the homogenous equation
are obtained, the desired solution of the nonhomogeneous
equation (21) is

D. Penalty Term for the infeasible operating point

Ideally,

the correction algorithm above can ensure the
solutions of the DDCOPF method to stay in the feasible
region. However, in practice, some factors may cause the
actual operating point (the power ﬂow) of the power system
to be infeasible.

In the correction equation (22), the load variation ∆PL(k)
is estimated by the AR model (16), thus the error of the pred-
ication will be propagated into the ﬁnal result. Consequently,
the solution ∆Pg(k) may not be restricted on the boundary
and drift out of the boundary due to the prediction error. Also,
since the change of power ﬂow is eliminated by the correction
algorithm by letting ∆Pf (k) = 0, the infeasible result cannot
return to the feasible region.

In addition, the inertia of the generator causes the delay
between the output reference (the solution of the DDCOPF)
and the actual output. So, when the reference is bounded on
the boundary of the feasible region, the actual output may not
stop increasing instantly, but overshoot beyond the limit. Then,
due to the equation ∆Pf (k) = 0, the operating point may not
go back to the feasible region.

Due to the above reasons, if the operating point moves
out of the feasible region, a penalty function is needed in
the constraint algorithm to pull the infeasible operating point
back to the feasible region. In other words, the power ﬂow
of the overﬂowed lines should be decreased to satisfy the line
ﬂow constraint (12). According to the equation (19), the power
ﬂow increment on the overﬂowed lines ∆Pf,v includes two
parts such that ∆Pf,v = HvTg∆Pg + HvTL∆PL. Due to
the correction algorithm, the loads related term HvTL∆PL is
eliminated by the solution ∆P η
g (k) of the nonhomogeneous
equation (21). Also, instead of ﬁxing the operating point by
letting its increment ∆Pf,v = 0 in the correction algorithm,
the penalty term should decrease the power ﬂow by making
the increment ∆Pf,v to be negative as follows,

where Fs(k) is a vector with positive entries which repre-
sents the step size of the power ﬂow decreasing. ∆P π
g (k) is
the change added on the generation reference to produce the
penalty. Due to the inertia of the power system, the change
∆P π
g (k) on the generation reference cannot affect the power
ﬂow instantly, so it is impossible to reduce the power ﬂow
Pf,v to the limit P max
in one iteration by directly letting
∆Pf,v = −(Pf,v − P max
f,v ). Therefore, the concept of PI
controller is employed to calculate the step vector Fs to
gradually decrease the power ﬂow to the feasible region.

f,v

Fs(k) = Kf,pd2Pf,v(k) + Kf,idPf,v(k)

where dPf,v(k) = Pf,v(k) − P max

(28)
and d2Pf,v(k) =
dPf,v(k) − dPf,v(k − 1). Kf,p and Kf,i are the proportional
gain and integral gain, respectively. Therefore, according to
the equations (27) and (28), the change of generation reference
to produce the penalty is obtained with the pseudoinverse as
follows,

f,v

∆P π

g = −(HvTg)+(Kf,pd2Pf,v +Kf,idPf,v)
In the power system, when the operating point is out of the
feasible region, this penalty term ∆P π
g (k) can be added to the
result from the correction algorithm, so that the ﬁnal result
becomes ∆P ∗
g (k) + ∆P ζ

g (k) = ∆P η

g (k) + ∆P π

g (k).

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

A IEEE 39-Bus power system model with 10 generators
and 39 buses is built in Matlab/Simulink as shown in Fig.3
[20]. The 39-Bus system is operated in 60Hz with 19 loads
on different buses. The communication network in the power
system includes two parts, one network connects all generator
controllers together and another network links all smart meters
in the system. In addition, each generator connects to a nearby
meter to get the power ﬂow information. As shown in Fig.3,
there is no centralized control center in the power system,
so the system is totally distributed. The parameters of the
generators are listed in Table I.

In this paper, two case studies are provided to show the
performance of the proposed method. In the ﬁrst case, the

limit of the line ﬂow on line 24 is set to 0.8 p.u. To simulate
the load variation and overﬂow, the load on bus 24 increases
by 100MW from 5s to 7s, so that the line 24 will overﬂow if
no action is taken. The results are shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5.
The top ﬁgure in Fig.4 shows that, without applying the
proposed DDCOPF method, the line ﬂow on line 24 will
go beyond the limit and stays at about 0.82. But, with the
proposed method, the line ﬂow decreases down below the
limit. In the ﬁgure, the estimated ﬂow is from the smart meter
with the DSE method. The estimation is almost the same as
the actual power ﬂow on the line, which means that the DSE
method is pretty accurate. The sub-ﬁgure at the bottom of the
Fig.4 shows when the constraint algorithm is actived. In Fig.5,
the frequency of the system returns to 60Hz after the load
variation and the Lagrange multipliers (Lambdas) are identical
for all generators, which means that the optimal solution of
the ED problem with power balance constraint as described in
equation (1) is achieved.

In another case study, the scenario in which two lines in the
power system are overﬂowed at the same time is simulated.
In this case, line 24 and line 27 exceed their maximal line
ﬂow, i.e., 0.8 p.u. for line 24 and 1.4 p.u. for line 27, after the
load increasing on bus 24. The simulation results are shown
in Fig.6, Fig.7 and Fig.8. Similar to the previous case, the
line ﬂow on both line 24 and line 27 decrease to the feasible
region. Also, the frequency and Lagrange multiplier show that
the system operates in the optimal condition.

The simulation is run on a PC with Intel i7-7700HQ 2.8GHz
CPU and 8GB memory. The time consumed by each iteration
of the algorithm is less than 0.000002s. So, the algorithm does
not require a very powerful computation device and is valid
for real-time running.

V. CONCLUSION

A DDCOPF method is proposed in this paper to address
the OPF problem with line ﬂow constraints. The proposed
the need of the
method is completely distributed without
centralized control center as in the traditional method. The

Fig. 8. Case 2: The Lagrange multiplier and frequency of the system

proposed method is developed based on the DED method and
the DSE method. The DED is to ﬁnd the optimal solution of
the OPF. The auto-regressive model is employed to identify the
potential overﬂow in the power system. Then, the constraint
algorithm consisting of correction algorithm and penalty term
is proposed to force the solution of OPF to satisfy the line ﬂow
constraints. The proposed method is simulated in a 39-Bus
system model in Matlab/Simulink. The results show that the
constraint algorithm can limit the line ﬂow within the feasible
region while reaching the optimal operation.
