ABSTRACT
We discuss the existence of elliptical polarisation in rotational spectral lines of CO and other molecules within the context of the
Anisotropic Resonant Scattering (ARS) model. We show that the eﬀect of ARS on the radiation ﬁeld can lead to not only the
previously predicted transformation of background linear polarisation into circular polarisation (i.e., Faraday conversion), but
also the occurrence of Faraday rotation and the generation of elliptically polarised signals in an otherwise initially unpolarised
radiation ﬁeld. This is due to a collective behaviour between the large number of molecules acting as a diﬀraction ensemble that
strongly favours forward scattering over any other mode. Our application to astronomical data demonstrates the dependency of
the Stokes parameters on the strength and orientation of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, and suggests that ARS will manifest itself
for a wide range of molecular species and transitions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Given the challenges involved in acquiring direct measurements of
magnetic ﬁeld strengths through the Zeeman eﬀect over a broad range
of sources (Crutcher 2012), studies aimed at characterizing the im-
portance and the role of magnetic ﬁelds in the star formation process,
or in other environments of the interstellar medium, have long relied
on indirect statistical methods (Davis 1951; Chandrasekhar & Fermi
1953). Accordingly, tools for the analysis of linear polarisation maps
from dust emission have been developed for pursuing these goals and
have provided much of the observational input in the recent past (see,
e.g., Lazarian & Hoang 2007; Hildebrand et al. 2009; Houde et al.
2009; Soler et al. 2013; Houde et al. 2016).

The prospect and subsequent realisation of dust polarization maps
at very high spatial resolutions with ALMA promised to push these
studies well within the domain of circumstellar disks and, further-
more, help elucidate the process of planet formation. Although some
deﬁnite progress has been made through corresponding observations
of protostellar systems (see, e.g., Maury et al. 2018; Hull & Zhang
2019), the use of dust polarisation maps at the ﬁnest scales has
been limited by the realisation that self-scattering of dust emission
by larger grains in circumstellar disks can remove the correlation
between the relative orientations of ambient magnetic ﬁelds and
measured linear polarisation (pseudo-)vectors (Kataoka et al. 2015;
Yang et al. 2016). Similarly, strong radiative alignment torques can
set dust grains in a precession about the radiation anisotropy vec-
tor rather than that of the magnetic ﬁeld (see Pattle et al. 2021 and
further references therein). A natural solution to this problem would
thus be to rely on linear polarization maps from molecular spectral

lines obtained in the same environments. It has long been known that
several species/transitions show linear polarization signals in their
spectra (Glenn et al. 1997). These are expected to be well correlated
with the orientation of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld responsible for the
underlying molecular alignment1, presumably through the so-called
Goldreich-Kylaﬁs eﬀect (Goldreich & Kylaﬁs 1981).

However, the initial discovery by Houde et al. (2013) of circular
polarisation signals in the CO (𝐽 = 2 → 1) transition (weakly sen-
sitive to the Zeeman eﬀect) at the peak intensity position in Orion
KL, as well as the subsequent detections in the same line (and in
CO (𝐽 = 1 → 0)) in SNR IC 443 by Hezareh et al. (2013) have
unveiled a more complicated picture for the nature of polarisation
found in molecular spectra. More precisely, most models developed
that either predicted or attempted to explain the existence of such
circular polarisation in molecular lines implied a conversion of back-
ground linear polarisation into circular polarisation (Deguchi & Wat-
son 1985; Wiebe & Watson 1998; Houde et al. 2013), which results
in a rotation of the linear polarisation vectors and a loss of their
correlation with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld’s orientation. This rota-
tion in the orientation of linear polarisation signals was conﬁrmed
with the SNR IC 443 observations of Hezareh et al. (2013), who
noted a lack of correlation in the corresponding orientations between

1 The expression “molecular alignment” is used in this paper to mean that the
symmetry axis of a molecule is aligned with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. In
general, it would be more precise to reserve the term “alignment” for situations
when (almost) degenerate magnetic sub-levels have unequal populations,
so that the angular momentum vector, 𝒋, has a preferred direction (with
respect to the symmetry axis, 𝑩). One speaks about “orientation” when
(cid:10)ˆ𝒋 · ˆ𝑩(cid:11) ≠ 0, while alignment is said to be present when

maps of CO (𝐽 = 1 → 0), CO (𝐽 = 2 → 1) and dust polarisation at
870 𝜇m. Most interestingly, their reinsertion of the circular polarisa-
tion also detected in the two CO transitions into the corresponding
linear polarisation signals (by reversing the aforementioned polar-
isation conversion process) reestablished a near perfect correlation
between the orientation of linear polarisation vectors in the CO maps,
as well as with the dust polarisation map.

The unavoidable consequence stemming from the work of Hezareh
et al. (2013) is that one should not blindly use linear polarisation mea-
surements from molecular lines when applying statistical techniques
initially developed for dust polarisation maps without properly ac-
counting for the presence of circular polarisation. At the very least,
one should ﬁrst verify if circular polarisation signals are present be-
fore attempting such analyses (see, e.g., Ching et al. 2016). This is
to be kept in mind as more measurements of circular polarisation
in molecular lines from ALMA become available (Vlemmings et al.
2019), while a recent search through the SMA archive suggests that
the presence of circular polarisation signals may be relatively com-
mon for several molecular species/transitions (Chamma et al. 2018).
A further implication arising from these considerations is the ne-
cessity of developing a better understanding of the physical pro-
cess(es) responsible for the existence of these polarisation signals in
molecular lines. Accordingly, in this paper we revisit the Anisotropic
Resonant Scattering (ARS) model of Houde et al. (2013) devel-
oped to explain the initial discovery of circular polarisation in
CO (𝐽 = 2 → 1) in Orion KL with the goal of setting it on a more rig-
orous theoretical footing (this model was also considered in Hezareh
et al. 2013 and Chamma et al. 2018, and applied to the SiO maser
observations of Cotton et al. 2011 by Houde 2014). We start in Sec. 2
by considering an analysis for the time evolution of an initial quantum
mechanical state describing a molecular ensemble and an accompa-
nying radiation ﬁeld, and investigate the radiation-matter interaction
due to absorption/emission and resonant scattering. In Sec. 3 we con-
sider the eﬀect of ARS on the state of the radiation ﬁeld, and we show
how it can lead to not only the transformation of background linear
polarisation into circular polarisation (i.e., Faraday conversion) pre-
dicted by Houde et al. (2013), but also the occurrence of Faraday
rotation and the generation of elliptically polarised signals in an oth-
erwise initially unpolarised radiation ﬁeld. We further calculate the
dependency of the Stokes parameters on the strength and orientation
of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld responsible for the alignment of the
molecular population. In Sec. 4 we apply our analysis to astronomical
data originally presented in Houde et al. (2013), while we summarize
our results in Sec. 5. Appendices detailing some calculations can be
found at the end.

2 ANALYSIS

Before discussing the generation and transformation of polarisation
signals through ARS, which involves the diﬀerences in the scattering
amplitudes between radiation modes of perpendicular polarisation
states, we must ﬁrst consider the time evolution of a single quantum
mechanical state. The system we have in mind is one composed of a
large group of 𝑁 (cid:29) 1 molecules (e.g., CO) occupying a volume of
linear size 𝐿 (cid:29) 𝜆, with 𝜆 the (average) wavelength of radiation, being
irradiated by an electromagnetic ﬁeld incident from a background
location and propagating in the general direction of an observer far
away in the foreground. On its way to the observer the radiation ﬁeld
interacts with the molecular population, which in the process alters
its polarisation state. We aim to characterise the polarisation state of
the emerging radiation as detected by the observer.

We therefore start with an initial and normalized compound molec-

ular/radiation state

(1)

(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) ≡ |𝑚(cid:105) (cid:12)

where the basis states are of the type (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11), with |𝑚(cid:105) a
global molecular state (see below and Appendix A) and (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11) the in-
cident radiation state with a large number of photons occupying a set
of radiation modes characterized by corresponding wave vectors and
one of two perpendicular polarisation states. For linear polarisation
these states will be denoted by (cid:107) and ⊥ for orientations respectively
parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the plane of the sky
component of the local magnetic ﬁeld responsible for molecular
alignment. A pair of orthogonal circular, denoted by the “𝑅” and
“𝐿” subscripts, as well as a pair of orthogonal elliptical polarisation
states will also be used. Although there are in principle several en-
ergy levels available to any molecule, we are interested in radiative
transitions between sets of potentially degenerate lower (cid:8)(cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑔 𝑗 (cid:11)(cid:9) and
excited {|𝑒𝑘 (cid:105)} states of energies 𝐸𝑔 and 𝐸𝑒, respectively.

Our analysis will focus on transitions in and out of states that have
(cid:12)𝑔 𝑗 (cid:11) and 𝑁𝑒 in an excited state |𝑒𝑘 (cid:105).

and label by |𝑚(cid:105) the aforementioned ket for the group of correspond-
ing degenerate global internal molecular states. The transitions en-
tering our analysis are thus of the type |𝑚(cid:105) ↔ |𝑚(cid:105) for scattering and
|𝑚(cid:105) ↔ |𝑚 ± 1(cid:105) for the absorption/emission of a photon, where there
are respectively 𝑁𝑒 ± 1 molecules in excited and 𝑁𝑔 ∓ 1 in lower
states for |𝑚 ± 1(cid:105).

We deﬁne the radiative state (cid:12)

(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11) as containing 𝑛𝛾 photons, and

could be represented as
(cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11) = |𝑛1, 𝑛2, . . . , 𝑛𝑤 , . . .(cid:105)
(3)
with 𝑛𝛾 = 𝑛1 + 𝑛2 + . . . + 𝑛𝑤 + . . . and where |𝑛1(cid:105) is the state
corresponding to mode 1 made of 𝑛1 photons characterized by a
wave vector k1 and a given polarization state (e.g., (cid:107), ⊥, 𝑅, 𝐿, ...),
etc.

Our analysis will consist of tracking the temporal evolution of the

system using the evolution operator
ˆ𝑈 (𝑡, 𝑡0) = 𝑒−𝑖 ˆ𝐻 (𝑡−𝑡0)/ℏ
such that the state of the system at time 𝑡 is (Cohen-Tannoudji et al.

|𝜓 (𝑡)(cid:105) = ˆ𝑈 (𝑡, 𝑡0) |𝜓0(cid:105)
(5)
with |𝜓0(cid:105) the state of the system at time 𝑡0. In equation (4) the
Hamiltonian is given by
ˆ𝐻 = ˆ𝐻0 + ˆ𝑊,
(6)
where ˆ𝐻0 consists of the sum of the independent (non-interacting)
molecular and radiation Hamiltonians, as well as the Zeeman Hamil-
tonian responsible for the corresponding splitting that lifts the degen-
eracy between the 𝜋 and 𝜎± spectral lines to be considered later. The

Accordingly, the summations on 𝑞 and 𝛼 are for radiation (wave vec-
tor and polarization) and molecular states, respectively (Grynberg
et al. 2010).

cesses by solving equations (12) and (13), respectively, starting with
the former.

Calculations for the probability amplitude for absorption/emission
pertain to the ﬁrst-order term in ˆ𝑊 given in equation (12). For the

iﬁes the molecule and 𝑟 the radiation mode; see Appendix B). The
ﬁrst three lines are for transitions from states |𝑢𝑛(cid:105) ≡ |𝑚 ± 1(cid:105) |𝑛𝑟 (cid:105) into

and we omitted terms not involving the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11). For example, this
equation reveals that all states which initially share the same radiation
modes as (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) but diﬀer in only one of them with one less photon,
and also share all of the same molecular states except for having
one more of these molecules in an excited state can contribute to
the probability amplitude of (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) through the emission of a photon
by that molecule into that radiation mode (the ﬁrst term within the
ﬁrst pair of square brackets). In the same manner, (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) can lose a
photon to the other states through absorption (the ﬁrst term within
the second pair of square brackets).

It is interesting to note that the presence of a large number of ran-
domly located molecules in the volume of interaction has an impor-
tant consequence on the expected value of the probability amplitude.
To better see this we make the simpliﬁcation where all states are

to stating that all combinations for 𝑟 and 𝛽 in the double summations
(cid:205)𝑟 (cid:205)𝛽, are realized and, therefore, 𝑒±𝑖 1
(cid:39) 1. We
could then rewrite for the term corresponding to the absorption of a
photon from a state |𝑚(cid:105) to a state |𝑚 + 1(cid:105), for example,

We recognize on the right-hand side of this relation a summation on

This implies that, on average, the corresponding probability ampli-
tude will cancel out to zero. The same applies for all processes in
equation (15). This, of course, does not mean that the ﬁrst order
processes of emission and absorption are unimportant since, as we
will now see, ﬂuctuations about this average will be responsible for
a probability scaling with the number of molecules. Rather, equa-
tion (19) implies that for a large ensemble of randomly positioned
molecules emission and absorption events are non-coherent. This
is radically diﬀerent from what will be found for the forward reso-
nant scattering process, which is coherent in nature, and leads to a
non-vanishing probability amplitude proportional to the number of
molecules.

To calculate the probability associated with the diﬀerent absorp-
tion and emission processes present in equation (15) we again assume
all states to be equally probable (i.e., 𝑐𝑟 𝛽 = 𝑐 𝑝 = 𝑐0) while we focus
on radiation modes pointing in the direction toward the observer, as
shown in Figure 1, since only them will factor in the calculations.
Squaring the norm of the probability amplitude brings in summations

(29)

(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) = |𝑚(cid:105) (cid:12)

For the matrix elements 𝑊 𝑝 𝑗 and 𝑊𝑘𝑛 on the right-hand side of
equation (29) the subscripts 𝑝 and 𝑛 are for a molecular state con-
taining, as before, 𝑁𝑔 molecules in the (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑔 𝑗 (cid:11) lower states and a pre-
determined number of photons, say, 𝑛𝛾 spread among the radiation
modes. More precisely, we set (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑛(cid:105) = |𝑚(cid:48)(cid:105) |𝑛𝑛(cid:105),
where both radiation states contain 𝑛𝛾 photons while the molecular
states |𝑚(cid:105) and |𝑚(cid:48)(cid:105) are initially assumed diﬀerent (i.e., both states
contain 𝑁𝑔 molecules in a lower state but with potentially diﬀerent
arrangements). The intermediate (virtual) states (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) con-
tain 𝑁𝑔 ± 1 molecules in lower states and 𝑛𝛾 ± 1 photons since they
result from the transformation of (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑛(cid:105), respectively, under
the action of ˆ𝑊. It follows that the associated molecular states are of
the types |𝑚 ± 1(cid:105) (i.e., 𝑁𝑔 ∓ 1 molecules in lower states).

The solution for equation (29) is rather lengthy and detailed in Ap-
pendix C, but we highlight here a key component resulting from the
underlying analysis. That is, the second-order nature of the problem
and, accordingly, the repeated appearance of the interaction term ˆ𝑊
in the equation (29) brings in double summations on the molecular
population of the type
𝑒𝑖k𝑟 ·r𝛽 𝑒−𝑖k𝑞 ·r𝛼 =

𝑒−𝑖(k𝑞−k𝑟 ) ·r𝛼 +

𝑒𝑖k𝑟 ·r𝛽 𝑒−𝑖k𝑞 ·r𝛼 ,

(30)

where 𝛼 and 𝛽 label the molecules while 𝑞 and 𝑟 are for the radiation
modes. Upon taking the expectation value of this expression the last
term on the right-hand side vanishes because of the random posi-
tioning of the molecules. The fact that only the single summation on
𝛼 remains has for a consequence that the two transitions in equation
(29) (through 𝑊 𝑝 𝑗 and 𝑊𝑘𝑛) must happen in only one molecule.
Furthermore, it is then possible to show that

where Δ𝑘𝑞𝑟 = 𝑘𝑞 − 𝑘𝑟 , sinc (𝑥) = sin (𝑥) /𝑥 and 𝐽1 (𝑥) is the Bessel
function of the ﬁrst kind of order one. The right-hand side of this
equation is strongly peaked at unity and further implies that k𝑞 =
k𝑟 . As discussed in Appendix C, these considerations force us to
conclude that the initial and ﬁnal states are the same (i.e., (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) =
|𝑢𝑛(cid:105)) and we are consequently dealing with forward scattering only.
It follows from this that the state of the system when accounting
for resonant scattering (including the zeroth-order term while the
ﬁrst-order term was shown to vanish in Sec. 2.1) can be written as

The damping term Γ is the sum of all radiation rates out of the
virtual states (compare with equations (23)-(24)), while Φ ((cid:28) ℏ𝜔 𝛼)
is responsible for a shift in unperturbed energy levels with P standing
for Cauchy’s principal value (Cohen-Tannoudji et al. 2018b). This
last quantity will have no inﬂuence on the results to be presented
later on.

We thus ﬁnd from equation (32) that the resonant scattering process
is dominated by forward scattering, which is coherent in nature.
This is due to the collective behaviour between the large number of
molecules acting as a diﬀraction ensemble that strongly favours this
type of scattering over any other mode (see equation (31)). This is
radically diﬀerent from the result obtained for absorption/emission
process in Sec. 2.1 for which the probability amplitude cancels out
due to its non-coherent nature.

The picture given by equation (32) for resonant scattering is thus

3 GENERATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF
POLARISATION SIGNALS THROUGH ARS

The discussion in the previous section was kept as general as possible
in the sense that we did not specify a basis with which to express
the polarisation state of the incident electric ﬁeld in the plane of
the sky. There are diﬀerent sets of bases available to express the
polarisation state of the radiation ﬁeld. For example, the linear basis
(cid:8)(cid:12)
(cid:11)(cid:9) of polarisation states respectively parallel and per-
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝, (cid:107)
pendicular to the orientation of the projection of the magnetic ﬁeld

for right and left circular polarisation states, respectively, can be
used to decompose a general radiation state (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11)2. Although the
linear polarisation basis would intuitively appear to be best suited
to situations where the magnetic ﬁeld is located in the plane of the
sky and the circular polarisation basis when it is aligned with the
line of sight, it is a priori not clear what basis should be used for
an arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld orientation. However, one can surmise
that it will be a function of the coordinate system underlying the
analysis. Furthermore, it is also important to realise that the form of
our solution, as expressed in equation (36), not only requires that we
somehow choose a basis well suited to our problem but that we ﬁnd
the exact eigen-basis corresponding to the total Hamiltonian (i.e.,
including the interaction term ˆ𝑊).

Our choice of coordinate systems is presented in Figure 2. The
system adopted for the ﬁxed observer frame is composed of the unit
vectors e3 for the direction of radiation propagation (and anti-parallel

2 To avoid any confusion we will from now on explicitly write the polarisation
state (apart from the mode 𝑝, here), the understanding being that all radiation
modes contained in, say, (cid:12)

(cid:11) are in the “ (cid:107)” polarisation state, etc.

e3, e𝑧, e (cid:107), and e𝑥 all share the same plane, while it is understood
that unit vectors and corresponding radiation states share the same

(cid:11)(cid:9) tends
to the linear polarisation basis when 𝜄 → 𝜋/2, and to the circular

polarisation basis when 𝜄 → 0 or 𝜋 (in these cases the orientation of
e (cid:107) becomes arbitrary).

Although the analysis to follow can be readily applied to any
incoming radiation polarisation state, we will focus on the case of an
incident linear polarisation signal at an angle 𝜑 from the e (cid:107)-axis, as
shown in Figure 2. That is, the corresponding incident polarisation
state is
(cid:11) + sin 𝜑 (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝,𝑖 (cid:11) = cos 𝜑 (cid:12)
(cid:12)

We therefore ﬁnd from equations (54)-(58) that the relative phase
shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 (𝜔) is made of contributions from one part necessitating
the existence of magnetic ﬁeld component in the plane of the sky
(i.e., Δ𝜙 𝑝,s, which is proportional to (𝜔𝑧 sin 𝜄)2) and from another
requiring a component along the line of sight (i.e., Δ𝜙 𝑝,c, which is
proportional to 𝜔𝑧 cos 𝜄). Although our discussion will be kept as
general as possible, it is found that Δ𝜙 𝑝,c (cid:29) Δ𝜙 𝑝,s for physical
conditions encountered in most astronomical media relevant to this
type of analysis. We also note that, although it is a complex quantity,
the relative phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 tends to become real far away from
resonance (i.e., when 𝜔±

𝛼 − 𝜔 (cid:29) Γ).

To investigate the behaviour of the polarisation signals under dif-
ferent situations it will be advantageous to ﬁrst express the relative
phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 as a function of its real and imaginary parts with

Δ𝜙 𝑝 = Δ𝜂 𝑝 + 𝑖Δ𝛾 𝑝,

(65)

where a dependency on the radiation frequency 𝜔 is implied.

In particular, it can be veriﬁed from equations (E13)-(E16) that in
the absence of a relative phase shift (i.e., when Δ𝜙 𝑝 = 0) we recover
the values

𝑢 𝑝 = sin(2𝜑)

expected for the incident linearly polarised state given in equation
(47). It is easily veriﬁed that this condition corresponds to the case
𝜔𝑧 = 0, i.e., when no magnetic ﬁeld is present.

Although the expressions for the Stokes parameters are in general
quite complex, they greatly simplify when the magnetic ﬁeld is either
parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the sky. We now turn our
attention to these special cases.

In general, the magnetic ﬁeld will have an arbitrary inclination angle
𝜄 while the incident electric ﬁeld can be decomposed into a sum of
polarised and unpolarised components. That is, the incident radiation
can be written as
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝,𝑖 (cid:11) = (𝛼0 + 𝛼1) (cid:12)
(cid:12)
where 𝛼0 and 𝛽0 are for the (deterministic) polarised component,
while 𝛼1 and 𝛽1 stand for the (random) unpolarised part. Given
its random nature, the unpolarised component of the state has the
following property for its mean values (cid:104)𝛼1(cid:105) = (cid:104)𝛽1(cid:105) = (cid:104)𝛼1 𝛽1(cid:105) = 0.
It therefore follows that only terms in the form of (cid:10)𝛼2
(cid:11)
(cid:11) and (cid:10)𝛽2
1
1
can contribute to the Stokes parameters. This does not apply to the
polarised part of the state.

(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝,⊥

(87)

(cid:11) ,

Given these properties, the polarised and unpolarised parts of the
radiation state can be treated independently, with their contributions
to the Stokes parameters combined afterwards to determine the ﬁnal
polarisation state of the emerging radiation (see Appendix E).

In the limit when the loss term is negligible (i.e., Δ𝛾 𝑝 → 0) we have

3.3.1 Generation of polarisation signals

𝑖 𝑝 = 1
𝑞 𝑝 = cos(2𝜑)
𝑢 𝑝 = sin(2𝜑) cos (cid:0)Δ𝜂 𝑝 (cid:1)
𝑣 𝑝 = sin(2𝜑) sin (cid:0)Δ𝜂 𝑝 (cid:1) .

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

This form for the Stokes parameters corresponds to a (Faraday)
conversion between linear and circular polarisations (i.e., between
Stokes 𝑢 𝑝 and Stokes 𝑣 𝑝) as a relative phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 builds up
during the evolution of the system. This is the case that was originally
considered by Houde et al. (2013).

3.2 Faraday rotation (𝜄 = 0 or 𝜋)

the line of sight, i.e., when 𝜄 = 0 or 𝜋,

Δ𝜙 𝑝 (𝜔) =

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

where the ‘-’ (‘+’) sign is for 𝜄 = 0 (𝜋). In the limit when Δ𝛾 𝑝 → 0
these equations transform to

𝑖 𝑝 = 1
𝑞 𝑝 = cos (cid:0)2𝜑 ∓ Δ𝜂 𝑝 (cid:1)
𝑢 𝑝 = sin (cid:0)2𝜑 ∓ Δ𝜂 𝑝 (cid:1)
𝑣 𝑝 = 0.

(83)

(84)

(85)

(86)

This corresponds to a Faraday rotation of the initial linear polarisation
states (i.e., involving Stokes 𝑞 𝑝 and Stokes 𝑢 𝑝) as a relative phase
shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 builds up as the system evolves.

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2020)

To deal with an upolarised incident radiation state we set 𝛼0 = 𝛽0 = 0,
𝛼1 = cos (𝜑1) and 𝛽1 = sin (𝜑1) with the angle 𝜑1 a random variable
such that, as mentioned before, (cid:104)𝛼1(cid:105) = (cid:104)𝛽1(cid:105) = (cid:104)𝛼1 𝛽1(cid:105) = 0 while
(cid:10)𝛼2
(cid:11) = 1/2. It is then found from equations (E8)-(E7)

that the normalised Stokes parameters pertaining to the emerging

(90)

where a dependency on the radiation frequency 𝜔 is again implied
(through Δ𝛾 𝑝).

We therefore ﬁnd from equations (88)-(90) the signiﬁcant result
that the ARS eﬀect will produce elliptical polarisation signals from an
incident unpolarised radiation ﬁeld. More precisely, we ﬁnd a linear
polarisation signature aligned with or perpendicular to the plane of
the sky component of the magnetic ﬁeld (sharing this ambiguity with
the Goldreich-Kylaﬁs eﬀect; see Goldreich & Kylaﬁs 1981) as well
as a circular polarisation part. The relative strength of the linear and
circular polarisation signals is determined by the inclination angle 𝜄
of the magnetic ﬁeld while the total amount of polarisation is set by
the parameter Δ𝛾 𝑝. It is, however, important to note that Δ𝛾 𝑝 also
has a dependency on 𝜄 through equations (54)-(55) and (65).

Under the assumption that all polarisation signals are generated
in the manner discussed here (i.e., there is no transformation of
polarised incident radiation, as in Sec. 3.3.2 below, for example) the
main parameters characterizing the polarisation states in equations
(88)-(90) can, in principle, be directly determined from observations,
albeit with some constraints. More precisely, we ﬁnd that

We therefore also ﬁnd an ambiguity in the inclination angle 𝜄 from
equation (91) since sin 𝜄 = sin (𝜋 − 𝜄), not unlike what is seen for the

9

orientation of the linear polarisation state on the plane of the sky.
Combined with the sign uncertainty present in equation (92), we are
left with four diﬀerent available combinations to ﬁt observational
data.

Finally, we note that while the sign of 𝑞 𝑝 and equation (91) informs
us on the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld in space, equation (92)
does the same for its strength through equations (54)-(58) and (65).

3.3.2 Transformation of polarisation

In order to get a sense of the transformation of an incident linear
polarisation signal, as deﬁned in equation (47), we proceed by ap-
proximating Δ𝜙 𝑝 (cid:39) Δ𝜂 𝑝. In other words, we neglect the imaginary
part of the relative phase shift that is responsible for the generation
of polarisation signals dealt with in the previous section (i.e., we set
Δ𝛾 𝑝 = 0 in equation (65)). Under such circumstances the Stokes
parameters simplify to (see equations (E13)-(E16))

(95)

Given that the polarisation state of the incident radiation is char-
acterised equations by (66)-(68), we see that the inclination angle
brings an interaction between the diﬀerent Stokes parameters. In
general, the ﬁrst terms on the right-hand side of these equations are
responsible for the Faraday conversion eﬀect discussed in Sec. 3.1
while the last terms bring in the Faraday rotation of Sec. 3.2. At
intermediate values for the inclination angle 𝜄 we have a mixture of
the two eﬀects, as a phase shift builds up with the temporal evolution
of the system.

4 APPLICATION TO ASTRONOMICAL DATA

We now turn our attention to the application of our ARS model to
astronomical data. To do so we must ﬁrst express key parameters
in term of observable or measurable quantities. For example, the
total number of molecules in the lower states 𝑁𝑔 depends on the
molecular density, the level of excitation (i.e., the temperature 𝑇
under thermodynamic equilibrium) and the volume of quantization
𝐿3. In turn, the volume’s linear size is related to the relaxation rate

with the Four-Stokes-Parameter spectral line Polarimeter (FSPPol;
Hezareh & Houde 2010) at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
(CSO) and originally published by Houde et al. (2013). The corre-
sponding circular and linear polarisation spectra are shown in Figures
3 and 4. As discussed in Houde et al. (2013), instrumental polarisa-
tion (IP) levels on the order of 0.2 − 0.3% are expected for FSPPol
(Hezareh & Houde 2010), which are consistent with the levels de-
tected at the position of peak intensity in Figures 3 and 4. We note
that the corresponding polarisation spectra have not been corrected
for IP. This should be kept in mind since contamination from tele-
scope side-lobes is likely to play a role for polarisation measurements
on extended sources, such as OMC-1. It is therefore likely that there
exists some contribution from IP in the observations presented here.
Following Houde et al. (2013) we use the model of Plume et al.

(2012) who estimated from CO isotopologues a number density
𝑛H2 = 107 cm−3 and an excitation temperature 𝑇 = 150 K for the
Orion KL Hot Core. Assuming a CO abundance of 𝜒CO = 10−4, we
have 𝑛 = 103 cm−3, 𝑄 (𝑇) = 54.6 and 𝑔𝑔𝑛𝑒/(cid:0)𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑔(cid:1) (cid:39) 0.93 (𝑔𝑔 = 3
and 𝑔𝑒 = 5). The ﬂux density 𝐹 (𝜔) comprises two components:
one for the Stokes 𝐼 CO spectral line (peaking at 𝑇 ∗
𝐴 (cid:39) 60 K for
one polarisation from Figure 3) and another from the continuum
radiation at the frequency of the CO (𝐽 = 2 → 1) transition (i.e.,
230.5 GHz). Using a peak ﬂux of (cid:39) 20 Jy at 850 𝜇m in a beam of
14(cid:48)(cid:48) from Johnstone & Bally (1999) as a starting point, we estimate
a continuum contribution of approximately 1.6 K in the 32(cid:48)(cid:48) CSO
beam at that frequency (one polarisation). The total ﬂux density can
then be converted to Jy (the corresponding factor is 32.5 Jy/K for
the CSO, while the telescope eﬃciency was ∼ 0.6). Other relevant
parameters are 𝐴𝑒𝑔 = 7 × 10−7 s−1, 𝐸𝑔/𝑘 = 5.5 K, 𝐸𝑒/𝑘 = 16.6 K
and a Landé factor 𝑔CO
𝐽 𝐵; Gordy & Cook
1984). Finally, as will be discussed below we model the scattering
molecular population using a Gaussian velocity distribution with a
(cid:17)
(cid:39) 4 × 10−9 rad s−1 (i.e., a velocity
peak value ℎ (𝜔0) = 1/
distribution of 𝑐Δ𝜔/𝜔0 (cid:39) 20 km s−1, corresponding to a FWHM
of approximately 46 km s−1). We thus ﬁnd, assuming that the spec-

tral line and the scattering molecular population’s maxima align at
the same frequency 𝜔0, Γ (cid:39) 1.7 × 104 s−1 and 𝐿 (cid:39) 1.8 × 106 cm,
while 𝑁𝑔/𝑔𝑔 (cid:39) 1 × 1020. Incidentally, the value obtained for Γ,
which we use at all frequencies, implies that the decay rate due to
(non-coherent) collisions is negligible (i.e., 𝛾coll ∼ 10−3 s−1).

In order to use equation (35) to calculate the Stokes parameters
we also need to know the interaction time 𝑡. This will either be
set by the physical size of the region through which the radiation
propagates (and resonant scattering occurs) or the mean free path
for the radiation, whichever is the shortest. An appropriate estimate
for the mean free path 𝑙mp is given by the inverse of the absorption
coeﬃcient (i.e., equation (27)), and given the ﬁgures above we have
𝑙mp = 𝛼 (𝜔)−1 ∼ 1016 cm and therefore 𝑡 (cid:46) 106 s.

Although we do not aim to provide a ﬁt to the data presented in
Figures 3 and 4, as this would require modelling through a level
of characterisation of the source we do not possess, we can use
the parameters discussed above to inquire if our ARS model can
qualitatively account for these observational results. More precisely,
we have computed the response of such a system in the presence
an ambient magnetic ﬁeld of 2 mG oriented at 60 deg from the
light of sight (i.e., 𝜄 = 120 deg), 𝑙mp = 2.5 × 1016 cm (note that
the magnetic ﬁeld strength and 𝑙mp are degenerate, i.e., a change
in one parameter can be compensated by the inverse change in the
other) and subjected to a weak incident linearly polarised signal
(i.e., 1 K or approximately 0.8% polarisation level at the peak) at
diﬀerent angles 𝜑0 relative to the projection of the magnetic ﬁeld
on the plane of the sky. Also, while we modelled the molecular
population with a Gaussian distribution, we use a Lorentzian proﬁle
(FWHM = 25 km s−1) for the incident Stokes 𝐼 to better mimic that
of the observations presented in Figure 3 (top panel). This line shape
is purely phenomenological, and only chosen to better model the high
velocity wings stemming from the bipolar outﬂow (see, for example,
Erickson et al. 1982 and Wilson et al. 1986). More speciﬁcally, it is
important to note that diﬀerent parts of the line proﬁle originate in
environments that are quite diﬀerent in nature, unlike the case of a
Gaussian proﬁle with thermal line broadening where one can assume
that the emitting gas is co-spatial across the proﬁle.

Figure 5 shows the total relative phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 accrued between
the two elliptical polarisation modes (cid:12)

(45)-(46)) as a function of velocity (using the left vertical scale) spe-
ciﬁc to a system of CO molecules. The real component Δ𝜂 𝑝 is shown
with the solid black curve and the imaginary part Δ𝛾 𝑝 with the red
triple-dot broken curve (times 100). The molecular distribution ℎ (𝑣)
is represented with the dot-dashed and hashed curve (normalised for
display purposes) while the incident Lorentzian Stokes 𝐼 spectrum is
shown using the dashed curve. The weaker term Δ𝛾 𝑝 is responsible
for the generation of polarisation signals shown in Figure 6. Since
this component of the outgoing radiation stems from the unpolarised
component of the incident signal (corresponding to the broken curve
for Stokes 𝐼unpol in the ﬁgure, using the vertical scale on the right),
it is independent of the angle 𝜑0 of the incident linear polarisation
component. In a manner consistent with equations (88)-(90), it is
seen from the ﬁgure that linear polarisation can only appear in di-
rections parallel or perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic
ﬁeld on the plane of sky (i.e, Stokes 𝑈 (red dot-broken curve) is
zero at all frequencies). It is also observed that for the case treated
here, where the peak of the molecular distribution is aligned with
that of the incoming radiation, both the Stokes 𝑄 (blue triple-dotted
broken curve) and 𝑉 (cyan solid curve) proﬁles are anti-symmetric
and reminiscent of what is expected for circular polarization stem-
ming from the Zeeman eﬀect. This speciﬁc behaviour disappears
when the alignment between the centre of the proﬁles for the molec-

(88)-(90), the linear polarisation can only appear in directions parallel or
perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld on the plane of sky, i.e.,
Stokes 𝑈 (red dot-broken curve) is zero at all frequencies. The importance of
the eﬀect increases at smaller inclination angle 𝜄, while the relative strength

the importance of the eﬀect increases at smaller inclination angle 𝜄,
while the relative strength between Stokes 𝑄 and 𝑉 is also a function
of this parameter (see equations (88)-(90)).

The real component of the phase shift Δ𝜂 𝑝 is responsible for
the transformation of the incident linear polarisation signal. The case
when 𝜑0 = −77.5 deg for our example is shown in Figure 7. Displayed
on the ﬁgure are the Stokes 𝑄, 𝑈 and 𝑉, as well as the polarised
component of the incident radiation denoted by Stokes 𝐼pol (broken
curve). As can been seen a signiﬁcant amount of the incident linear
polarisation is transformed into circular polarisation in the process.
In fact, at peak value the Stokes 𝑉 signal is the strongest at (cid:39) 0.9 K ,
nearing the maximum intensity of the incident polarised signal.

In Figure 8 we show the total Stokes parameters consisting of
the combination of the corresponding signals resulting from the un-
polarised (in Figure 6) and polarised (as in Figure 7) components
of the incident radiation for three diﬀerent values of incidence an-
gle 𝜑0 = −77.5, −2.5, and 72.5 deg. The two components of a given
Stokes parameter are combined in the manner explained in Appendix
E (see equation (E25)). In the top panels of the ﬁgure, the linear po-
larisation signal 𝑃linear is shown (green broken curve) along with
Stokes 𝐼, 𝑄, 𝑈 and 𝑉, while in the bottom panels the polarisation

A comparison between the top three panels in Figure 8 gives an
indication on the variety of proﬁles each Stokes parameters can take
and their dependency on the incident polarisation angle 𝜒0 = 𝜑0.
For example, the appearance of the Stokes 𝑉 line intensity can go
from an almost symmetric proﬁle (left panel at 𝜑0 = −77.5 deg),
to one showing the emergence of an inverted shoulder (centre panel
at 𝜑0 = −2.5 deg) and to a fully anti-symmetric shape reminiscent
of the Zeeman eﬀect (right panel at 𝜑0 = 72.5 deg). The case for
𝜑0 = −77.5 deg, which consists of the combination of the signals
presented in Figures 6 and 7, displays some of the same properties
found in the proﬁles for the circular and linear polarisation signals
measured in Orion KL and shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
In particular, we ﬁnd that the Stokes 𝑉 spectrum has its peak slightly
shifted to positive velocity compared to the Stokes 𝐼 proﬁle, and
𝑃linear displays a double-lobe feature with a slightly elevated right
shoulder, similar to what is seen in the bottom panel of Figure 4.
The diﬀerence in sign between our computed and observed Stokes 𝑉
spectra stems from the fact that Houde et al. (2013) used a diﬀerent
deﬁnition for this parameter (Houde 2014). However, there are also
diﬀerences such as in the width of the Stokes 𝑉 proﬁle and a more
pronounced change in the polarisation angle for the model of Figure
8. We also ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld strength (i.e., 2 mG) needed to
recover the polarised intensities measured in Orion KL is as expected
from previous measurements found in the literature (Crutcher et al.
1999; Houde et al. 2009; Chuss et al. 2019).

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2020)

We have developed in the previous sections a model for the inter-
action between a group of molecules, aligned under the inﬂuence
of a local magnetic ﬁeld, and an incident radiation ﬁeld originating
from some background source and propagating towards an observer
far away in the foreground. The temporal evolution of this radia-
tion/matter system happens through the fundamental processes of
absorption, emission and scattering of photons. While our analysis
originates from a starting point similar as that presented by Houde
et al. (2013), i.e., seeking to explain the discovery of circularly po-
larised signals in the CO(𝐽 = 2 → 1) rotational line in Orion KL
through the ARS eﬀect, our results quantitatively diﬀer from theirs
on some points. These diﬀerences stem from two key components in
our new analysis, i.e., the realisation that i) the resonance damping
rate Γ is not set by collisions but by the coherent radiative processes
that determine the lifetimes of the virtual states involved in the scat-
tering process, and ii) the full solution to the problem must involve
an elliptical polarisation basis (as opposed to a linear polarisation
basis) to describe the eigenstates of the quantized radiation ﬁeld at
arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld orientations.

The determination of the resonance damping rate is an integral
part of our solution to the problem and yielded a corresponding
value that is orders of magnitude larger than previously thought for
the Orion KL CO(𝐽 = 2 → 1) data. Accordingly, this implies signif-
icantly smaller correlation length 𝐿 = 𝑐/Γ and quantization volume
𝐿3 for the radiation ﬁeld, as well as a reduced number of molecules
involved in the ARS process. The increased value for Γ also brings
into play the imaginary component Δ𝛾 𝑝 of the relative phase shift
Δ𝜙 𝑝(= Δ𝜂 𝑝 + 𝑖Δ𝛾 𝑝) through which the ARS eﬀect manifests itself
on the polarisation state of the scattered radiation. More precisely,
this imaginary component Δ𝛾 𝑝 is responsible for the generation of

polarised signals in an otherwise unpolarised incident radiation ﬁeld
(see Sec. 3.3.1). This eﬀect was negligible in the analysis of Houde
et al. (2013).

While the use of a linear basis for expressing the radiation ﬁeld
initially revealed the existence of a Faraday conversion responsible
for the transformation of linear polarisation into circular polarisation
(and vice-versa), the elliptical polarisation basis further introduces
a Faraday rotation of linearly polarised signals when the magnetic
ﬁeld is (anti-)aligned with the line of sight, and a mixture of the
two eﬀects at arbitrary inclination angles. The relative importance in
the accrued phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 of the term responsible for the Faraday
rotation also largely compensated for the aforementioned reduced
number of scattering molecules and preserved the strength of the
ARS eﬀect.

Our calculations and application of the ARS eﬀect to the Orion
KL CO(𝐽 = 2 → 1) data of Houde et al. (2013) has conﬁrmed that
ARS is potentially unavoidable to explain the polarisation charac-
teristics of some molecular rotational lines. First, the generation of
polarisation signals is an inherent part of the eﬀect. Although our
example showed the levels of linear and circular polarisation ex-
pected from ARS to be on the order of a fraction of a percent for the
case considered (see Fig. 6), they could easily be signiﬁcantly higher
with slight variations on some parameters (e.g., smaller inclination
angle, higher gas density, stronger magnetic ﬁeld, lower excitation
temperature, etc.) and brought to levels similar to those expected
for the Goldreich-Kylaﬁs eﬀect (for linear polarisation; Goldreich &
Kylaﬁs 1981). While ARS exhibits the same 90 deg ambiguity as the
Goldreich-Kylaﬁs eﬀect for the orientation of the generated linear
polarisation relative to that of the plane of the sky component of
the magnetic ﬁeld, it also displays further ambiguities for the incli-
nation angle (‘𝜄’ vs. ‘𝜋 − 𝜄’) and the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld
(through the sign of Δ𝛾 𝑝; see Sec. 3.3.1). Second, ARS is highly
eﬃcient in transforming the polarisation state of background radi-
ation signals through the coupling of the Stokes parameters (Secs.
3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.2). We have considered the case of incident lin-
early polarised signal for the Orion KL CO(𝐽 = 2 → 1) data, which
could stem from either the Goldreich-Kylaﬁs or the ARS eﬀects in
the background radiation source, and saw that, as mentioned earlier,
a mixture of both Faraday conversion and Faraday rotation was re-
sponsible for the appearance of elliptical polarisation in the scattered
radiation. This transformation property of the ARS is not limited to
linear polarisation signals, however, and applies more generally to
incident elliptical polarisation states.

It is important to note that the appearance of ARS polarisation
signals in molecular rotational lines is entirely due to the Zeeman
broadening of the line proﬁles. Namely, it is the slight relative dis-
placements in frequency of the 𝜎± spectral components between
themselves and against the 𝜋 transition that are the sources of the
relative phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝. Accordingly, and as we saw in Sec. 3, the
ARS eﬀect disappears whenever 𝜔𝑧 → 0, i.e., as the magnetic ﬁeld
strength vanishes (see equations (66)-(68)). More precisely, while the
Zeeman eﬀect commonly discussed in the literature is for emission
(or absorption) processes (Crutcher 2012) the eﬀect underlying our
analysis can, in fact, be directly attributed to the Zeeman eﬀect for
scattering. Although it is generally expected that scattering rates will
be negligible compared to those due to emission and absorption pro-
cesses for a single molecule at the wavelengths discussed here, the
collective eﬀect and the resulting coherence between molecules that
characterise ARS greatly enhance the probability amplitude associ-
ated with forward scattering and renders the corresponding Zeeman
eﬀect (i.e., for scattering) observable for molecules such as CO (see
below). These molecules/transitions are otherwise unaﬀected by the

13

usual Zeeman eﬀect in emission (or absorption). We note that the
ARS enhancement is not limited to the Zeeman eﬀect for scattering
but would also apply to other phenomena responsible for the splitting
of energy levels (e.g., the Stark eﬀect). For that reason, and to avoid
potential confusion, we will keep referring to the Zeeman eﬀect as
that which applies to emission or absorption processes and to ARS
for the eﬀect analysed and discussed in this paper.

Given the relationship between the two phenomena, it should not
be surprising that ARS also displays other characteristics usually as-
sociated with the Zeeman eﬀect. For example, it is well established
that Zeeman Stokes 𝑉 signals, which stem from the subtraction of in-
tensities due to the 𝜎± transitions, scale with the frequency derivative
of the Stokes 𝐼 spectrum for a small Zeeman broadening (Crutcher
et al. 1993). For ARS it is the relative phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝,c that results
from the subtraction of corresponding components for the 𝜎± tran-
sitions (see equations (53) and (56)), and therefore scales with the
frequency derivative of the scattering population distribution (i.e.,
in equation (58)) for the generation of polarisation signals. These
derivative-like terms (for both the Zeeman and ARS eﬀects) are
proportional to the strength of the line of sight component of the
magnetic ﬁeld (see again equation (58)). In a similar manner, the
Zeeman Stokes 𝑄 and 𝑈 parameters for linear polarisation are pro-
portional to the second order frequency derivative of the Stokes 𝐼
signal and the square of the strength of the plane of the sky compo-
nent of the magnetic ﬁeld. Because of their respective functionalities,
it is found that |𝑉 | (cid:29) |𝑄| , |𝑈| (Crutcher et al. 1993). Once again
ARS somewhat mimics this behaviour in that it is the relative phase
shift Δ𝜙 𝑝,s that scales with the second-order frequency derivative of
ℎ (𝜔 𝛼) (see equations (55) and (57)) and the square of the strength
of the plane of the sky component of the magnetic ﬁeld (see again
equation (57)), while it is found that Δ𝜙 𝑝,c (cid:29) Δ𝜙 𝑝,s. The simi-
larities go no further, however, since for ARS the term due to the
ﬁrst-order frequency derivative of ℎ (𝜔 𝛼) is also responsible for the
generation of linear polarisation signals since the total relative phase
shift Δ𝜙 𝑝 (cid:39) Δ𝜙 𝑝,c enters in the equation for all Stokes parameters
(see equations (93)-(95)). Also, as we have established in Sec. 3 and
mentioned above, ARS is not only responsible for the generation of
elliptically polarised signals from unpolarised background radiation
but also for the transformation of the polarisation state of an incident
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Another fundamental diﬀerence between the ARS and Zeeman ef-
fects concerns the way they establish themselves within a molecular
population. That is, any individual molecule sensitive to the Zee-
man eﬀect (e.g., CN) within a molecular gas subjected to an ambient
magnetic ﬁeld will experience a Zeeman broadening in its spectral
transitions because of the inﬂuence of the Zeeman interaction term
on the molecular energy levels. In that sense, the Zeeman eﬀect is felt
locally by all molecules that form the gas and can be observed as long
as the magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough, the molecular column density
suﬃcient to build a detectable Stokes 𝑉 spectrum and velocity gra-
dients or magnetic ﬁeld reversals are not too pronounced to weaken
or cancel Zeeman features along corresponding lines of sight. On
the other hand, ARS is a collective eﬀect between the constituents
and cannot be described as happening on any given molecule with
the eﬀect increasing incrementally as the radiation scatters on indi-
vidual molecules while propagating through the gas. In other words,
ARS is not local. Rather, ARS will become detectable whenever
a large enough number of molecules is present within the correla-
tion volume characterising the radiation ﬁeld (𝐿3 in our analysis).
These molecules then act as a diﬀraction unit that enforces forward
scattering as the dominant process and, as a consequence, renders
ARS coherent in nature. This coherent behaviour from the group

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2020)

14 M. Houde et al.

of molecules involved in the scattering of the background radiation
manifests itself through the scaling of the relative phase shift Δ𝜙 𝑝
with the number of molecules.

Finally, given the predicted strength of ARS for molecules weakly
sensitive to the Zeeman eﬀect, such as CO, one may inquire about its
potential importance for other molecules (e.g., CN) used to measure
magnetic ﬁeld strengths through the Zeeman eﬀect. The Zeeman
broadening for these transitions will be about three orders of mag-
nitude larger than those for CO. One may therefore wonder if the
polarisation signals measured with these molecules contain contri-
butions from both the Zeeman eﬀect and ARS, which could result in
a signiﬁcant complication for the interpretation of the corresponding
measurements. Such instances could only be examined on a case by
case basis as ARS will only become relevant when Δ𝜙 𝑝 ∼ 1, a re-
lation which is strongly dependent on the radiation coherence length
𝐿. A precise determination of this length scale would then become
essential.

These considerations and the analysis presented in this paper tes-
tify to the fact that the ﬁeld of research focused on the study of
magnetic ﬁelds through the polarisation characteristics of molecular
rotational lines is becoming increasingly rich in its contents and its
reach. Disentangling the eﬀects from the diﬀerent processes poten-
tially at play, e.g., the Zeeman eﬀect (Crutcher et al. 1993, 1999),
the Goldreich-Kylaﬁs eﬀect (Goldreich & Kylaﬁs 1981), collisional
polarisation (Lankhaar & Vlemmings 2020) and ARS (Houde et al.
2013 and this work), will necessitate all the tools at our disposal. As
was exempliﬁed by the work of Hezareh et al. (2013), which we dis-
cussed in Sec. 1, comparisons with dust polarisation measurements
will be essential. And most importantly, observations aimed at these
processes should include spectra of all Stokes parameters as both
linear and circular polarisation signals will hold clues vital for the
successful completion of these studies.

APPENDIX A: GLOBAL MOLECULAR STATE

The quantum mechanical state of a molecule will contain, in gen-
eral, an internal component specifying levels of speciﬁc energies, as
well as another for its external degrees of freedom (e.g., position,
momentum, etc.). Although there are in principle several internal

energy levels available to any molecule, we are interested in radia-
tive transitions between sets of potentially degenerate lower (cid:8)(cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑔 𝑗 (cid:11)(cid:9)
and excited {|𝑒𝑘 (cid:105)} states of energies 𝐸𝑔 and 𝐸𝑒, respectively. If we
assume that the molecule possesses a well deﬁned linear momentum
p, then we can write its initial state as
|𝜑1(cid:105) = |p(cid:105) |𝑒𝑘 (cid:105)
when in the excited state3. The electric-dipole interaction term of the
Hamiltonian for this molecule can be written as

where |𝑚(cid:105) is a global internal state formed by the direct product
of the corresponding individual states (i.e., (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑔 𝑗 (cid:11), |𝑒𝑘 (cid:105), etc.) of each
molecule (as deﬁned in Sec. 2). It follows that the state of the system
of 𝑁 molecules consists of a superposition of products of the type
|r1, . . . , r𝑁 (cid:105) |𝑚(cid:105) that, because of the linearity of the Schrödinger
equation, can be treated independently. Each of these product state
includes a phase term 𝑒(cid:205)𝑁
𝑖p𝛼 ·r𝛼/ℏ, which can be omitted while
solving the Schrödinger equation (as long as they are once again
included afterwards if one wish to return to the linear momentum
basis |p(cid:105), for example). We then note that the only “role” of the
position basis state |r1, . . . , r𝑁 (cid:105) in the process is to substitute ˆr → r

where 𝑀 is the molecular mass, p𝛽 = 𝑀v𝛽 the linear momentum of

a non-zero probability amplitude are those that can only diﬀer for one
atom (located at r𝛽) and one radiation mode (mode 𝑟), as previously
indicated. The number of molecules in an excited state |𝑒𝑘 (cid:105) in |𝑢𝑛(cid:105)
is given by 𝑁𝑒 + 1.

In all, there are a total of four diﬀerent processes involving state

|𝑚 − 1(cid:105) and emission from a state |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) into a state |𝑚(cid:105); absorption
into a state |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) and emission into a state |𝑚 − 1(cid:105) from a state |𝑚(cid:105).
We have dealt with the emission from a state |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) above. Emission
from a state |𝑚(cid:105) yields the same result as in equation (B3) with the
substitution 𝑁𝑒 + 1 → 𝑁𝑒. For the absorption of one photon we
only need to consider the complex conjugate of equation (B3) while
substituting 𝑁𝑒 + 1 → 𝑁𝑔 when out of a state |𝑚 − 1(cid:105), as well as
𝑛𝑟 + 1 → 𝑛𝑟 and 𝑁𝑒 + 1 → 𝑁𝑔 + 1 when out of a state |𝑚(cid:105). We
recover equation (15) when combining these four cases.

since the second term on the ﬁrst line consists of a summation over
random phases, which vanishes, and where ℎ (𝜔 𝛼) is the normalized
probability distribution function of the molecular Bohr frequency.
We note that, while there are 𝑁𝑒 + 1 molecules in an excited state
|𝑒𝑘 (cid:105) in |𝑢𝑛(cid:105), the number of possible transitions for a given radiation
mode is 𝑔𝑔. This has for consequence that the probability associated
to emission will scale as (𝑁𝑒 + 1) 𝑔𝑔/𝑔𝑒, as indicated in equation
(B7), although that associated with absorption out of (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑝 (cid:11) scales as
𝑁𝑔 (see equation (20)). We therefore write

B2 Probability of absorption and emission

For the probability calculations we start by focusing on the emission
process into (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝 (cid:11) in equation (15) while assuming all
states to be equally probable with 𝑐𝑟 𝛽 = 𝑐 𝑝 = 𝑐0 such that, in this
case, for the state (cid:12)

However, as stated in Sec. 2.1, for the states relevant to the analysis
only radiation modes pointing in the direction to the observer will

It is interesting to note that these two rates practically cancel each

4 To be more precise we should square the norm of the sum of the emission
and absorption processes into (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢𝑝 (cid:11) in equation (15). But because one summa-
tion is on 𝑁𝑒 + 1 molecules in upper states and the other on 𝑁𝑔 + 1 molecules
in lower states, the cross terms will only involve two molecules common to
both summations and can thus be safely neglected since 𝑁𝑔, 𝑁𝑒 (cid:29) 1 (see
equation (B7)).

APPENDIX C: RESONANT SCATTERING

Solving equation (29) for the second-order probability amplitude
requires us to ﬁrst evaluate the term (cid:104)𝑢 𝑗 | ˆ𝑈 (𝑡 (cid:48), 𝑡 (cid:48)(cid:48)) |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) on its right-
hand side. To do so, we adopt the following perturbation expansion

(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) must share the same type of molecular state,
i.e., |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) and |𝑚(cid:48) + 1(cid:105) for the case considered here. Furthermore,
the only diﬀerence between these two states can only happen for the
molecule hosting the transitions (e.g., that molecule can be in state
|𝑒𝑘 (cid:105) for |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) and |𝑒𝑘(cid:48)(cid:105) for |𝑚(cid:48) + 1(cid:105) with 𝑘 ≠ 𝑘 (cid:48)).

We can go further by transforming the exponential in equation

(C5) using cylindrical coordinates and write

while the second (ﬁrst-order) term was calculated to be zero in Sec.

still with 𝑊 𝑗𝑛 = (cid:104)𝑢 𝑗 | ˆ𝑊 |𝑢𝑛(cid:105) and 𝜔𝑛𝑘 =

our discussion we will assume that the molecular states associated
with (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) are of the type |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) (or |𝑚(cid:48) + 1(cid:105), where both
have 𝑁𝑔 − 1 molecules in a lower state but with potentially diﬀerent
arrangements) and we focus on the speciﬁc case where a photon is
emitted from the state |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105). We will consider all possible cases later
on. We thus write

where the summation on 𝑛 now implies (cid:205)𝑛 = (cid:205)𝑚 (cid:205)𝑛𝑛 , i.e., with the
ﬁrst summation on molecular states of type |𝑚(cid:105) (which must have
𝑁𝑔 molecules in lower states) and the second on radiation modes. In
equation (C4) we again assume the dipole moments to be the same
for all molecules. Given this, and as was discussed in Sec. 3, the
double summation on 𝛼 and 𝛽 for the molecules can be factored out
and its expected value will bring in the following term

which implies that the two transitions in equation (C4) must hap-
pen in only one molecule. The same will be true if a photon is
absorbed from state |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) instead of being emitted, or if the molecu-
lar states associated with (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) are of type |𝑚 − 1(cid:105) instead
of |𝑚 + 1(cid:105). However, whenever (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) and |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) are associated to dif-
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) = |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) (cid:12)
ferent types of molecular states (e.g., when (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑗 (cid:11) and
|𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) = |𝑚 − 1(cid:105) |𝑛𝑘 (cid:105), etc.) we must have a minimum of two molecules
diﬀering in their states (i.e., they have respectively have 𝑁𝑔 − 1 and
𝑁𝑔 + 1 molecules in lower states) and the condition that the two tran-
sitions happen for one molecule cannot be met. This will result in

since the product of the two averages results from the fact that the
positioning of the molecules along the diﬀerent axes is statistically
independent. We also set the orientation of k𝑟 as a reference and
expressed k𝑞 in relation to it.

(C6)

The summation on the molecules on the right-hand side of equation
(C5) is nothing more than a diﬀraction relation and, given that the
wavelength 𝜆 (cid:28) 𝐿, we therefore expect 𝜃 (cid:28) 1 in equation (C6).
Thus keeping the exponent to ﬁrst order in 𝜃 in the ﬁrst average on
the right-hand side we have
𝑒−𝑖(𝑘𝑞 cos 𝜃−𝑘𝑟 ) 𝑧𝛼 (cid:69)

which, given the expected size of the system, implies that we can
safely set 𝑘𝑞 = 𝑘𝑟 from now on.

The right-hand side of equation (C9) is very strongly peaked in 𝜃,
since 𝐿 (cid:29) 𝜆, has a maximum of one at 𝜃 = 0 and ﬁrst reaches zero
at 𝑘𝑞 𝐿𝜃/2 (cid:39) 3.83, which implies the following constraint

(C10)

Equation (C10) justiﬁes our previous assumption when dealing with
equation (C7). The constraints given by equations (C8) and (C10)
imply that k𝑞 = k𝑟 .

Most importantly, the combination of the condition of having the
same type of globular molecular state (e.g., |𝑚 + 1(cid:105) and |𝑚(cid:48) + 1(cid:105))
with k𝑞 = k𝑟 also implies that (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) = |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) in equation (C3) since
the photon emitted from |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) is removed through the absorption of
another photon of similar characteristics into (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑢 𝑗 (cid:11) (diﬀerent polarisa-
tion states will occur at diﬀerent frequencies because of the Zeeman

principal value. In going from the second to the third line we took
advantage of the fact that the (inverse) Fourier transform of ℎ (𝜔 𝛼)
is of limited temporal width (in 𝜆-space) to extend the upper bound
of the integral on 𝜆 from 𝑡 (cid:48) − 𝑡 (cid:48)(cid:48) to inﬁnity.

The same calculations can be performed for the absorption of a

of the displacement in energy Φ is to bring a shift in the Bohr fre-
quency of transitions between states |𝑢𝑛(cid:105) and |𝑢𝑘 (cid:105) (Cohen-Tannoudji
et al. 2017). Otherwise, this energy displacement will not have any
incidence on the outcome of our analysis.

proceed in a manner similar to what was done previously for equation

APPENDIX D: ELLIPTICAL BASIS

Our solution to the problem of the interaction between a large num-
ber of molecules and an incident radiation ﬁeld established the dom-
inance of the forward resonant scattering process. One of the con-
sequences of this is the realisation that compound eigenstates (i.e.,
molecular and radiation together) for the non-interacting Hamilto-
nian ˆ𝐻0 are also eigenstates for the interacting problem5. It therefore
follows that the molecular states of type |𝑚(cid:105) (as deﬁned in the discus-
sion surrounding equation (2)), and their linear combinations, used
in the analysis are the corresponding eigenstates for the matter com-
ponent. However, the radiation eigenstates for a given polarisation
and mode (i.e., (cid:12)
(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝, 𝑗 (cid:11) with 𝑗 = 1, 2 in Sec. 3) were assumed to exist
and never explicitly written down. In this appendix we show how this
basis can be determined from symmetry considerations.

We ﬁrst note that ˆ𝐻0 contains the Zeeman interaction term respon-
sible for the splitting of the 𝜋 and 𝜎± spectral components. Because
the magnetic ﬁeld is assumed responsible for the alignment of the
molecules’ electric dipole moment, it will set the rotational symme-
try of the Hamiltonian. More precisely, we can express the electric
dipole moment using the basis characterizing the 𝜋 and 𝜎± spectral
transitions through (Cohen-Tannoudji et al. 2018b)

5 This can be veriﬁed by replacing the interaction Hamiltonian ˆ𝑊 by an ef-
fective interaction Hamiltonian deﬁned by the second order interaction term,
which is proportional to |𝑑 |2 (Grynberg et al. 2010). This is feasible because
the probability amplitude of the interaction Haniltonian’s ﬁrst order term van-
ishes (see Sec. 2.1 and Appendix B). This eﬀective interaction Hamiltonian
will have the same symmetry as ˆ𝐻0, and therefore share its eigenstates, since
|𝑑 |2 is totally symmetric under the molecular symmetry (MS) group of a
single molecule (Bunker & Jensen 1998).

where the diﬀerent unit vectors on the right-hand side are deﬁned
in Figure 2. It is therefore advantageous to use the orientation of
the magnetic ﬁeld projected on the plane of the sky to deﬁne our
polarisation basis.

As was mentioned in Sec. 3, given that we expect the polarisation
basis to tend to a purely linear polarisation basis when 𝜄 → 𝜋/2 and
a circular basis when 𝜄 → 0 or 𝜋 we write

e1 = 𝑎e (cid:107) + 𝑖𝑏e⊥
e2 = −𝑏e (cid:107) + 𝑖𝑎e⊥,

(D8)

(D9)

where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are real functions of 𝜄 while 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 = 1. The expres-
sions central to our analysis, and which stems from the interaction
Hamiltonian, concerns the relative phase shift accrued between these
two polarisation states as the system evolves. More precisely, we are
interested in the following relations
𝑥 𝜋 (𝜄) = |e 𝜋 · e1|2 − |e 𝜋 · e2|2
2 − (cid:12)
(cid:12)
𝑥± (𝜄) = (cid:12)
2 ,
(cid:12)
which are the only parts that are functions of 𝜄 in the equations for
the relative phase shift (see equations (50)-(51) and (54)). Inserting
equations (D5)-(D9) into equations (D10)-(D11) we ﬁnd

Equations (D14)-(D15) should exhibit the same symmetry as the
Hamiltonian of the system. For example, it can be readily veriﬁed that
Δ𝜙 𝑝,s and Δ𝜙 𝑝,c are unaﬀected by any rotation about the magnetic
ﬁeld axis e𝑧 (i.e., the 𝐶∞ rotation group with e𝑧 as the symmetry
axis; Bunker & Jensen 1998). There exists an inﬁnite number of
combinations for 𝑎 and 𝑏 that satisfy this requirement.

(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝,1

(cid:12)𝑛 𝑝,2

(cid:11) and (cid:12)

However, because our polarisation basis e1 and e2 (and corre-
sponding states (cid:12)
(cid:11)) are tied to the orientation of the
magnetic ﬁeld on the plane of the sky, the relative phase shifts Δ𝜙 𝑝,s
and Δ𝜙 𝑝,c must also be invariant under rotations and improper rota-
tions about the e3 axis, the inversion of coordinates and a reﬂection
across the plane of the sky (i.e., the 𝐷∞h point group with e3 as the
symmetry axis; Bunker & Jensen 1998) since they leave the incli-
nation angle 𝜄 either unchanged or transformed to 𝜋 − 𝜄. It follows
that since sin2 𝜄 is invariant under these operations then so must be
𝑎2 − 𝑏2, which must therefore take the form 1, sin 𝜄, cos2 𝜄, ... or some
combination of these. On the other hand, cos 𝜄 changes sign under

improper rotations (including the inversion) and a reﬂection across
the plane of the sky, thus so must 𝑎𝑏. Considering these constraints
the simplest relations for our basis require 𝑎 ∝ ± cos 𝜄 and 𝑏 ∝ ±1

The normalized Stokes parameters at frequency 𝜔 introduced in
equations (61)-(63) for an arbitrary incident signal can be explicitly
calculated as a function of the diﬀerent parameters entering in the
analysis. That is, by expressing the relative phase shift accrued be-
tween the two elliptical basis states (cid:12)

and imaginary parts
