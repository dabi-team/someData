ABSTRACT
The Extreme Ultraviolet Normal Incidence Spectrograph (EUNIS) and the Hinode/ EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) observed AR 11726 on 2013 April 23. We present intensity images in numerous
atomic lines constructed from these observations. These lines are formed over a wide range of temper-
atures, and we use their relative intensities to constrain a parameterization of nanoﬂare heating. We
construct a 3D model of the magnetic ﬁeld in this active region by extrapolating the surface magnetic
ﬁeld into the corona and using SDO/AIA images of coronal loops to ensure that extrapolated magnetic
ﬁeld lines co-align with observed coronal loops. We trace 2848 magnetic ﬁeld lines within the volume
of this active region and model how they ﬁll with hot plasma in response to nanoﬂare heating. We
perform a parameter study to determine how the frequency and energy released in nanoﬂares scale
with magnetic ﬁeld strength and loop length. From our 3D model, we construct synthetic images of
the lines observed by EUNIS and EIS and constrain the parameter study by minimizing the diﬀerence
between the synthetic and observed images.

INTRODUCTION
Explaining the mechanisms that maintain hot plasma
(> 1 MK) in solar corona active regions has been a
longstanding unresolved question in solar astrophysics.
Many previous studies have identiﬁed the coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld as the primary energy source powering this
heating (e.g., see the review in Klimchuk 2006), and im-
ages of coronal active regions have shown that they are
highly structured into loops which are thought to trace
out the magnetic ﬁeld. It is likely within these loops that
magnetic energy is converted into heat. One broad group
of theories describing this process involves the dissipation
of Alfv´en waves (Ionson 1978; Hollweg 1984; Davila 1987;
van Ballegooijen et al. 2011; McIntosh et al. 2011) and
another involves impulsive heating at small scales likely
due to reconnection of ﬁlamented loops at sub-resolution
(i.e., nanoﬂares) (Glencross 1975; Lin et al. 1984; Parker
1988; Cargill 1994).

In the nanoﬂare scenario, independent heating events
occurring on individual strands within coronal loops can
impulsively raise the strand plasma to temperatures ∼ 6 -
10 MK, which is much hotter than the average active
region temperature of 2 - 4 MK. The heating time is
quite fast perhaps < 100 s, but the cooling time through
thermal conduction and radiation can be much slower.
Thermal conduction also drives chromospheric ablation
(historically referred to as evaporation; Antonucci et al.
1999; Bornmann 1999; Fletcher et al. 2011) which pop-
ulates the loop with denser plasma. The net eﬀect of
many such events occurring at random throughout the

joel.c.allred@nasa.gov

corona results in the observed “average” corona.

The nanoﬂare model has recently attracted more atten-
tion because of new observations that demonstrate the
existence of very hot plasma in closed loops within an ac-
tive region. Ishikawa et al. (2017) detected faint but very
hot (> 10 MK) plasma using the Focusing Optics X-ray
Solar Imager (FOXSI-2) sounding rocket. Brosius et al.
(2014) report on an observation from the Extreme Ul-
traviolet Normal Incidence Spectrograph (EUNIS-13) of
AR 11726. They observed faint but pervasive emission in
the atomic line, Fe XIX 592.2 ˚A, which forms in the tem-
perature range 6 - 11 MK. Such hot plasma may be an
indication of nanoﬂare heating. Viall & Klimchuk (2012)
have detected the signature of plasma cooling from a
peak temperature of at least 7 MK by looking at time
delays between ﬁlters on the Atmospheric Imaging As-
sembly (AIA). Testa et al. (2014) and Polito et al. (2018)
showed that Doppler shifts observed in transition region
bright points is most consistent with impulsive heating
low in the coronal loop as predicted from nanoﬂare sim-
ulations.

Hudson (1991) noted that the ﬂare frequency is related
to the energy released by a power-law, with index, α. Lu
& Hamilton (1991) showed this power-law distribution
can arise when the coronal magnetic ﬁeld is in a self-
organized critical state. For scales of large ﬂares down to
microﬂares, it is relatively straightforward to determine
α directly, and perhaps a similar index applies even to
the scale of nanoﬂares, but this is not certain. Many au-
thors have attempted to constrain this index. For exam-
ple, Parnell & Jupp (2000) performed a statistical study
of events observed in the EUV ﬁlters on Transition Re-

gion and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). Following up that
work, Aschwanden & Parnell (2002) used observations
from EUV ﬁlters on TRACE combined with soft X-rays
from Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and obtained a
value for α that is consistent with the self-organized crit-
ical theory. A more complete discussion of this subject
is presented in Klimchuk (2006).

The EUNIS-13 observation of AR 11726, ﬁrst described
in Brosius et al. (2014), was coordinated to have co-
temporal observations from the Hinode/ EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS; Kosugi et al. 2007; Culhane et al.
2007), and of course, continuous monitoring from the
instruments aboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO;
Pesnell et al. 2012). This wealth of data provides a
unique opportunity to constrain the emission measure
in that active region over a wide range of temperatures.
For this work, we parameterize the nanoﬂare frequency
distribution as a power-law and use these data to con-
strain the slope and scale of that distribution. We ex-
trapolate the observed surface magnetic ﬁeld into the
corona and trace thousands of closed ﬁeld lines within
the active region volume. We interpret these ﬁeld lines
as the centers of coronal loops and perform simulations
of nanoﬂare heating within them by randomly sampling
the parameterized nanoﬂare frequency distribution. We
use the resulting temperature and density stratiﬁcation
within the loops— Sun: magnetic ﬁelds to predict atomic
line emission. These are projected along the Earth’s line
of sight, and we compare these synthetic images with
the EUNIS and EIS observations. By varying param-
eters and minimizing the diﬀerence between prediction
and observation, we constrain the nanoﬂare frequency
distribution.

This paper is organized as follows.

In §2 we de-
scribe EUNIS, EIS and SDO coordinated observations
of AR 11726. In §3, we demonstrate how we have con-
structed a 3D model of the magnetic ﬁeld in this active
region, and in §4 we describe using hydrodynamic sim-
ulations of nanoﬂares to model populating these loops
with hot plasma and the resulting emission. We present
the results of a parameter study designed to constrain
the frequency distribution of nanoﬂares in §5, and ﬁnally
in §6 we discuss these results and draw conclusions.

2. SDO, EUNIS, AND EIS OBSERVATIONS OF AR 11726
2.1. SDO
We used the six coronal channels of the SDO/AIA in-
strument (Boerner et al. 2012; Lemen et al. 2012) (i.e.,
AIA 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335) to provide contex-
tual alignment for EUNIS and EIS and for loop tracing
(§3). The times of the AIA images were chosen to closely
match the EUNIS observation (2013-04-23 17:32:00 UT).
AIA level-1 FITS ﬁles observed at this time were down-
loaded using the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) ser-
vice (SSW IDL routine, VSO SEARCH). The ﬁlter images
and headers (including pointing information) were read
using READ SDO. Similarly, the SDO/Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al.
2012) line-of-sight magnetogram was obtained and read
using the VSO SEARCH and READ SDO procedures.

2.2. EUNIS
EUNIS is a two-channel imaging spectrometer designed
to observe the Sun with high temporal and spatial res-

olutions. Spectra are taken in 692 pixels along slits
with length 636(cid:48)(cid:48). Thus, each pixel covers 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)92, which
oversamples the spatial resolution of the optical system
(∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48)) by about a factor of 3. To reduce noise and
ensure that the eﬀective spatial resolution matches the
optical system, three neighboring pixels are averaged to-
gether. The slits move across the ﬁeld of view at a rate of
2.(cid:48)(cid:48)14 s−1 in a direction perpendicular to the slit’s length,
and taking 1.32 s exposures. This yields an eﬀective spa-
tial resolution of 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)77 × 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)82. The two channels cover
the wavelength ranges of 525 - 635 ˚A and 300 - 370 ˚A and
include lines that form at temperatures ranging from 0.03
- 10 MK, but for this study we have focused on lines in
the temperature range 1 - 10 MK. These lines are listed
in Table 1.

EUNIS was ﬂown on a sounding rocket on 23 April
2013 and observed AR 11726. For this work, we use 32
exposures that comprise the ﬁrst full northward-directed
raster of AR 11726 (17:32:45- 17:33:26 UT). The central
time of this 41 s raster is 17:33:06 UT. Line intensities
and uncertainties were measured by ﬁtting the line pro-
ﬁles to Gaussians as discussed in Brosius et al. (2014).
The low and high channel observations were co-aligned
to the AIA 193 channel using the Fe XII 338.3 ˚A and
Fe XII 592.6 ˚A images, respectively. In this procedure,
we varied the Solar-X and -Y coordinates of EUNIS’s slit
center, rotation angle, and pixel sizes to minimize the χ2
diﬀerences between these and the AIA 193 image. The
slits were rotated by an angle of 3.3◦ clockwise relative
to the solar east-west axis. The images were centered
at solar positions, (659.(cid:48)(cid:48)6, 251.(cid:48)(cid:48)5) and (660.(cid:48)(cid:48)7, 251.(cid:48)(cid:48)5),
for the low and high channel, respectively. More instru-
ment details and the observing sequence are discussed in
Brosius et al. (2014).

2.3. EIS
Hinode/EIS performed coordinated observations of
AR 11726. EIS is a two-channel imaging spectrometer
covering the ranges 170-210 ˚A and 250-290 ˚A. Numerous
atomic lines formed over a wide range of temperature
are included in these bands. The lines observed by EIS
and used in this study are listed in Table 1. Level-0
data stored in FITS ﬁles were converted into Level-1 us-
ing the SSW IDL routine, EIS PREP. Similar to Young
et al. (2012), we found that in addition to the standard
wavelength correction computed for each pixel, an addi-
tional wavelength correction of ∼ 0.02 ˚A was needed to
be added to the long wavelength channel. This correc-
tion was obtained from the assumption that the Doppler
shifts in the Fe XIII 252.0 ˚A and Fe XIII 202.0 ˚A are iden-
tical. Line intensities and corresponding uncertainties
were obtained using Gaussian ﬁts to the line proﬁles and
were performed using the routine, EIS AUTO FIT, and us-
ing the calibration correction of Del Zanna (2013). Bad
pixels were removed during the line ﬁtting procedure.

We co-aligned the EIS low and high channel observa-
tions to the AIA 193 channel using the Fe XII 193.5 ˚A
and Fe XIII 252.0 ˚A images and implementing a χ2 min-
imization procedure similar to what was described above
for EUNIS. The EIS slits have a width of 2(cid:48)(cid:48)and were
oriented along the north-south axis and moved along the
east-west axis taking a total of 61 50 s exposures. The
eﬀective pixel size is 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)00 × 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)00 with a resolution of 3 -

243.(cid:48)(cid:48)5) and (677.(cid:48)(cid:48)3, 259.(cid:48)(cid:48)7), for the low and high chan-
nels, respectively. Images of several of the EIS and EU-
NIS line intensities together with the AIA 193 channel
are shown in Figure 1.

3. CONSTRUCTING A 3D MODEL OF AR 11726
We have constructed a 3D model of AR 11726 by ex-
trapolating the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld observed by
SDO/HMI into the corona using the Vertical Current Ap-
proximation Non-linear Force Free Field (VCA-NLFFF)
technique described in Aschwanden (2013, 2016). The
key advantage of this technique is its ability to iden-
tify loop structures in AIA images and minimize the
misalignment of predicted magnetic ﬁeld lines compared
with the position of observed loops. This is important
for comparisons of our AR model to observed images dis-
cussed in § 5.1. For this study, we have conﬁgured the
VCA-NLFFF code to use 150 potential and non-potential
sources and considered a 0.5 R(cid:12) ﬁeld of view centered at
the heliographic position, N11W47. AIA and HMI im-
ages were selected to most closely match the time of the
EUNIS observation (§2.1). Only the coronal AIA chan-
nels were used by the VCA-NLFFF code, i.e., the AIA
94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 channels. With these pa-
rameters the VCA-NLFFF code calculated the 3D mag-
netic ﬁeld within a volume centered around N11W47 and
extending 0.5 R(cid:12) in the heliocentric Cartesian x and y

directions and to a height of 1.5 R(cid:12) in the z direction.
These are calculated on a regular heliocentric Cartesian
grid with resolution of 315 × 315 × 430. Within this vol-
ume, we have traced magnetic ﬁeld lines in each voxel.
Those ﬁeld lines that close within the volume and have
a minimum loop length of 1 Mm become part of our en-
semble. The minimum loop length criterion was chosen
to eliminate very short loops that would not be observ-
able by current instruments. We found 2848 ﬁeld lines
ﬁt these criteria. We interpret these ﬁeld lines as the
centers of closed loops with circular cross sections. The
cross sectional area of the loops is assumed to expand into
the corona so that magnetic ﬂux is conserved within the
loop. Formally, the cross sectional area, A(s), is derived
from the equality, A(s)B(s) = A(s = 0)B(s = 0), where
s is the distance along the loop and B is the magnetic
ﬂux density. The radius of the loop at s = 0 is assumed
to be 220 km (0(cid:48)(cid:48).3) for each loop which is comparable
to loop radii observed by high-resolution imagers such
as Hi-C (Kobayashi et al. 2014) and comparable to the
average loop width determined by Aschwanden & Peter
(2017). The mean loop radius including the expansion
factor is 620 km. Figure 2 shows the 3D position of a
representative set of ﬁeld lines and their projection onto
an AIA 171 image.

Since the area expansion of each loop is calculated in-
dependently, it is possible for the cross sectional areas of
neighboring loops to overlap. When calculating emission
from these loops, it important that an overlapping vol-
ume is not double-counted. When a voxel has more than
one loop going through it, the emission originating from
that voxel is determined by averaging the emission from
each of the corresponding loops.

4. SIMULATING THE HYDRODYNAMIC RESPONSE TO

NANOFLARE HEATING

4.1. Nanoﬂare Frequency Distribution
For this work, we want to explore how the frequency
of nanoﬂare heating events scales with the energy re-
leased in the events, the local magnetic ﬂux density and
the length of the magnetic ﬂux loops where they occur.
To that end we parameterize the frequency distribution
function of nanoﬂare heating and study how varying pa-
rameters best reproduce the coronal emission in atomic
lines formed over a broad temperature range observed
by EUNIS and EIS. We assume that the frequency, f ,
of occurrence of a nanoﬂare with energy between E and
E + dE in the volume, dV , is given by

f = f0(E/E0)α(B/B0)β(L/L0)γdEdV,

(1)

where E0 = 1023 erg, B0 = 5 G, and L0 = 50 Mm are
characteristic scale sizes of the nanoﬂare energy, mag-
netic ﬂux density, and loop length, respectively. α, β,
and γ are power-law index parameters that determine
how the frequency scales with energy, magnetic ﬂux den-
sity and loop length, respectively. We deﬁne f0 in terms
of a parameter, q0, by

f0 ≡

intensity map images for several lines observed by EUNIS and EIS. The white band near the center of the Fe XII 193.5 ˚A image indicates
a region where line proﬁle ﬁts could not be performed because of missing data.

q0 is related to the time-averaged volumetric heating
rate. That heating rate is given by

(3)

E0 and Ef are the smallest and largest energy events
considered in this nanoﬂare frequency distribution. We
assume Ef = 1027 erg, which is comparable to the energy

released in a small microﬂare.

In summary, the free parameters characterizing the fre-
quency distribution are α, β, γ, and q0. In theory, the
duration of a nanoﬂare heating event is also a parameter.
However, we have found that the time-averaged diﬀer-
ential emission measure (DEM) only weakly depends on
the duration. Dissipating the nanoﬂare energy faster pro-
duces a hotter transient, but the heat ﬂux quickly moves
that energy throughout the loop resulting in a similar

temperature structure to what would be obtained had
the energy been dissipated more slowly. For the study
described in §5, we have chosen a uniform duration for
all nanoﬂare events of 100 s.

4.2. 1D Hydrodynamic Loop Models
In active regions, the magnetic pressure is much greater
than the gas pressure meaning that the magnetic force
conﬁnes charged particles to move along ﬁeld lines. The
dynamics then are well-represented as occurring within
one-dimensional
loop structures (albeit with spatially
varying cross-sectional areas). In this work, we perform
simulations of nanoﬂares occurring in each of the 2848
loops traced in §3. The hydrodynamic response of each
loop is assumed to be independent of other loops.

These simulations are performed using the ARC7 code
(Allred & MacNeice 2015). ARC7 was designed to solve
the MHD equations in 2.5D using a ﬁnite volume ﬂux-
corrected transport scheme (Boris & Book 1973), but
we have removed the magnetic ﬁeld equations and re-
duced the code to solving hydrodynamics in a 1D ge-
ometry, with that dimension being the axis of a mag-
netic loop. As mentioned in §3, the cross sectional area
of a loop expands into the corona in order to conserve
magnetic ﬂux. ARC7 includes this expansion of area in
calculating conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
ﬂuxes. Both boundaries of the loop are held at a temper-
ature of 20 kK. The density of the boundary is typically
about 1 × 1013 cm−3 but that and the boundary velocity
are allowed to vary in order to maintain a non-reﬂecting
boundary condition.

ARC7 solves conservation equations for mass, momen-
tum and energy on a grid with resolution, ds = 385 km.
A typical loop length is 1 × 105 km, resulting in about
260 grid cells. We have performed simulations at higher
resolutions and found negligible diﬀerences, so we as-
sume that this resolution is suﬃcient. The momen-
tum equation includes gravitational acceleration, g =
g0(R(cid:12)/r)2(ds · ˆr), where g0 is the acceleration at the
solar surface, r is the radial distance from solar center,
and ds·ˆr is the component of the loop axis along the ver-
tical direction. The energy equation includes the eﬀects

of Spitzer thermal conduction and optically-thin radia-
tive losses. The radiative loss function is tabulated us-
ing the CHIANTI (v. 8.0.7; Dere et al. 1997; Del Zanna
et al. 2015) routine, RAD LOSS. In order to generate stable
starting loop conditions, we add a small heating term and
allow the loops to relax to a state of hydrostatic equilib-
rium. The heating term maintains the coronal tempera-
ture at approximately 0.1 MK and the coronal density at
∼ 107 cm−3. These very low values were chosen to ensure
that any emission measure above 1 MK is not aﬀected
by this background heating. The equilibrium solution
is used as a starting state for the simulations presented
below.

To simulate nanoﬂares we add an additional heat-
ing term to the energy equation. The probability of a
nanoﬂare with energy, E, occurring within a computa-
tional grid cell with volume, dV, is given by the frequency
distribution function (Eq. 1) using the local magnetic
ﬂux density and the overall loop length. During a simu-
lation ARC7 randomly samples the distribution function
for each grid cell to determine if a nanoﬂare occurs there.
If so, the nanoﬂare heating term dissipates the energy, E,
over 100 s by linearly increasing the heating for 50 s and
then linearly decreasing back to zero for 50 s. We simu-
late the evolution of the loops for tf = 1 × 105 s. This
is enough time so that even relatively infrequent events
will have a chance of occurring.

As an example, we show in Figure 3 the evolution of the
loop highlighted in yellow in Figure 2 for a particular set
of parameters. In this case, α = −2.5, β = 1.5, γ = −1.5,
and q0 = 5×10−4 erg cm−3 s−1. The left panel shows the
temperature and density at the loop apex. A nanoﬂare
early in the simulation quickly causes the apex tempera-
ture to rise to 3 MK. This is followed by a much smaller
event which increases the temperature to 3.5 MK. The
apex cools until about t = 3.7 × 104 s when it is hit again
by another nanoﬂare and quickly heats again. After the
ﬁrst event, the apex density gradually rises as chromo-
spheric material ablates into the corona. When another
event happens the density quickly drops since the sud-
den increase in pressure forces material away from the
explosion, but then gradually increases again from the

6

chromospheric ablation. The right panel shows the time-
averaged DEM ﬁeld, φ (Eq. 5; discussed below in §4.3),
as a function of position along the axis of the loop. The
legs of the loop are cooler than the apex and dominated
by temperatures in the range 1 - 2 MK, although there
is a small emission measure up to 4 MK at the cusp of
the legs at positions 30 - 50 Mm and 200 - 210 Mm.

4.3. Constructing Emission in the 3D Volume
The simulated evolution of each loop is independent of
the others, i.e., there is no reason to believe that t = 0
for one loop corresponds to the same absolute time as
t = 0 for some independent loop, so our method does
not construct a time-dependent 3D model. Rather, from
the time evolution of each loop, we wish to construct a
3D representation of the time-averaged emission result-
ing from all loops.

The time-averaged radiated power per unit volume
from an atomic line originating at any point in space, x,
is obtained from the plasma density and the line contri-
bution function, G(Ne, T ), using the following formula:

I(x) =

Ab
tf

tf(cid:90)

0

G (Ne(x, t), T (x, t)) Ne(x, t)NH (x, t)dt,

(4)
where t+dt is the period of time over which plasma at the
position, x, has a temperature, T , and electron density,
Ne. The hydrogen density, NH is assumed to be related
to the electron density by NH = 0.83Ne. The abun-
dance, Ab, is from the tables in Schmelz et al. (2012).
The contribution functions, G(Ne, T ), are obtained from
the CHIANTI database and its corresponding ionization
equilibrium table. We assume that the lines studied here
are optically-thin so that the intensity incident on an
observer is simply an integral of I(x) over the observer’s
line of sight.

Similarly, we deﬁne a time-averaged diﬀerential emis-

sion measure ﬁeld, φ(x, T ), by

φ(x, T ) ≡

where ti + dt is a time interval over which the position,
x, has temperature in the interval T + dT . The DEM
experienced by an observer is obtained by integrating φ
along the observer’s line of sight,

5. PARAMETER STUDY
The frequency of nanoﬂare heating is parameterized
using Eqs. 1 - 2. We constrain the parameters, q0, α, β,
and γ, by varying them and comparing the resulting pre-
dicted emission with the EUNIS and EIS observations.
The ranges over which these parameters were varied is
shown in Table 2. First, these were varied using a res-
olution listed in the “Course Step” column. Once best
values were found at this resolution, we used the resolu-
tions listed in the “Fine Step” column to ﬁne tune the
parameter study. For each set of parameters, the hy-
drodynamic response to nanoﬂare heating was modeled
using the procedure described in Section 4.

5.1. Comparisons to EUNIS and EIS observations
The synthetic line intensities derived for each simula-
tion are integrated along an Earth observer line of sight
and projected onto the EIS and EUNIS image maps ob-
tained in §2 using the following technique. The 3D vol-
ume over which our simulations were performed, as de-
scribed in §4, is divided into many voxels chosen to be
suﬃciently small so that their volumes project to within
a single EUNIS or EIS pixel. The heliocentric Cartesian
coordinates of these voxels are projected onto the EU-
NIS and EIS pixel grids using the SSW IDL routines,
WCS CONV HCC HPC and WCS GET PIXEL. A simulated im-
age is obtained by summing the contribution to each
pixel from each voxel, and ﬁnally the simulated image
is convolved with the EUNIS and EIS point spread func-
tions. As an example, Figure 4 compares EIS and EUNIS
images of several lines with the corresponding simulated
images.

The end result of each simulation is a set of images for
the lines listed in Table 1. We compare these with the
EUNIS and EIS observations by calculating the weighted
L2-norm diﬀerence, d, between the simulated and ob-
served images. That is

5.2. Results and Discussion
We performed approximately 500 simulations varying
(q0, α, β, γ) over the ranges in Table 2. Since each simu-
lation requires evolving more than 2800 loops, this repre-
sents a major computational undertaking. We found the
parameter set that minimizes d to be q0 = 1.0 × 10−3 erg
cm−3 s−1, α = −2.4, β = 1.5, and γ = −1.0. Figure 4
compares the predicted emission in several lines with the
EIS and EUNIS images. Similarly, Figure 5 compares
AIA 193 and 94 channel images with synthetic images
constructed from our best ﬁt parameter set.

Figure 6 shows the time-averaged heating rate (Eq. 3)
resulting from this simulation integrated along the line of
sight. Most of the active region receives ∼ 107 erg cm−2
s−1 as expected from previous studies (e.g. Withbroe &
Noyes 1977). However, the hottest regions receive nearly
two orders of magnitude more heat. Figure 7 shows the
time-averaged DEM resulting from this parameter set for

ﬁve temperature bins. The bottom right panel shows this
DEM integrated over its spatial extent. The DEM peaks
at a temperature of 3.3 MK and quickly falls oﬀ, with an
average slope of −9 in log-log space. The DEM at 10 MK
is nearly 5 orders of magnitude smaller than at the peak
at 3.3 MK. These values are comparable to those ob-
tained by Warren et al. (2012) who studied hot emission
in several active regions using the EIS instrument. By
directly imaging thermal soft X-ray bremsstrahlung from

AR 12234 during the FOXSI-2 sounding rocket ﬂight
(Glesener et al. 2016), Ishikawa et al. (2017) found a
steeper slope of −12.

It is useful to compare our best ﬁt parameters with pre-
dictions from coronal heating theories. Table 5 in Man-
drini et al. (2000) and extended in Table 1 of Lundquist
et al. (2008) provide concise summaries for how many of
these models scale with B, L, R, and v, where R is the
loop radius and v is the footpoint velocity. Our assump-

angle” model (Parker 1988; Berger 1993) i.e., Model 2
in Mandrini et al. (2000). This model postulates that
coronal heating occurs by dissipating magnetic energy
when misalignment between adjacent ﬂux tubes reaches
a critical angle. This misalignment can result from either
twisted or braided ﬁeld lines.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Using the EUNIS and EIS observations of AR 11726,
we have constructed images of the intensity in many
atomic lines that form over a wide range of tempera-
tures. We have used HMI magnetograms and AIA im-
ages to construct a 3D model of the magnetic ﬁeld within
a volume that encloses AR 11726. We have traced mag-
netic loops within this volume and performed simulations
of how their temperature and density stratiﬁcation re-
spond to nanoﬂare heating. We have parameterized the
nanoﬂare frequency distribution (Eq. 1) and by varying
these parameters and comparing predicted emission to
the EUNIS and EIS observations we have constrained
the frequency distribution. We ﬁnd the distribution is
best ﬁt with q0 = 1.0 × 10−3 erg cm−3 s−1, α = −2.4,
β = 1.5, and γ = −1.0. This scaling with magnetic ﬁeld
and loop length best matches the “critical angle” model
(Parker 1988; Berger 1993).

tion, that the loop radius scales to conserve magnetic
ﬂux means that R ∝ B−1/2. For this work, we have
not investigated the scaling with velocity, so to compare
with these listed models we must make an assumption of
how v scales with B and L. We follow the Case (b) as-
sumption from Lundquist et al. (2008) that is v ∝ B−1/2
which is relevant for twisting-type velocities. In our best
ﬁt model, the heating rate scales as B1.5 and L−1. This
is most similar to the scaling obtained from the “critical
