ABSTRACT

It is well established that magnetic free energy associated with electric currents powers solar ﬂares and coro-
nal mass ejections (CMEs) from solar active regions (ARs). However, the conditions that determine whether
an AR will produce an eruption are not well understood. Previous work suggests that the degree to which the
driving electric currents, or the sum of all currents within a single magnetic polarity, are neutralized may serve
as a good proxy for assessing the ability of ARs to produce eruptions. Here, we investigate the relationship
between current neutralization and ﬂare/CME production using a sample of 15 ﬂare-active and 15 ﬂare-quiet
ARs. All ﬂare-quiet and 4 ﬂare-active ARs are also CME-quiet. We additionally test the relation of current
neutralization to the degree of shear along polarity inversion lines (PILs) in an AR. We ﬁnd that ﬂare-productive
ARs are more likely to exhibit non-neutralized currents, speciﬁcally those that also produce a CME. We ﬁnd
that ﬂare/CME-active ARs also exhibit higher degrees of PIL shear than ﬂare/CME-quiet ARs. We addition-
ally observe that currents become more neutralized during magnetic ﬂux emergence in ﬂare-quiet ARs. Our
investigation suggests that current neutralization in ARs is indicative of their eruptive potential.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar active regions (ARs) harbor strong magnetic ﬁelds
and often host sunspots. They are a major source of erup-
tive activity, including solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). Solar eruptions are drivers of space weather events
— changes in near-Earth space that can negatively affect the
technology we use on Earth (i.e., telecommunications satel-
lites). A substantial effort has been made to accurately pre-
dict space weather events (see e.g., Bobra & Couvidat 2015;
Leka & Barnes 2007). Such predictions are heavily depen-
dent on understanding the source environments of solar erup-
tions (i.e., ARs).

The standard model for an AR states that it is comprised of
a ﬂux rope — a tube-like region of space containing a twisted
magnetic ﬁeld. An example of a ﬂux rope is shown by the
cartoon in Figure 1(a). When a twisted ﬂux tube emerges
through the photosphere, an AR will form, indicated by a
strong concentration of magnetic ﬁeld in the photosphere.
Flux ropes are also current carrying structures. Direct cur-
rents (DC) connect the centers of each AR polarity and are
generated by the ﬂux rope itself, while return currents (RC)

surround the direct currents and oppose them. Figure 1(a)
shows where these currents are nominally distributed in a ﬂux
rope prior to emergence through the photosphere.

It is well-established that free magnetic energy associated
with electric currents in ARs drives ﬂare/CME eruptions (see
e.g., Schrijver et al. 2005; Shibata & Magara 2011). How-
ever, it is still unclear how well these driving electric cur-
rents are neutralized. An AR is considered neutralized when
the ratio of DC to RC |DC/RC| in each magnetic polarity is
close to 1.

The degree of current neutralization in ARs has been de-
bated for several decades. Parker (1996) suggested that
the average net current density of an AR is zero. This
follows from the assumption that AR magnetic ﬁelds are
composed of individually current-neutralized magnetic ﬁb-
rils that, when combined, render the entire magnetic conﬁg-
uration current-neutralized. However, Melrose (1991, 1995)
argued that non-neutralized currents can emerge along with
the emergence of magnetic ﬂux as an AR evolves. Mel-
rose (1991, 1995) also suggested that the return currents
could escape detection, which would render the net currents
non-neutral. Longcope & Welsch (2000) devised a model
for this by showing that return currents become trapped be-
neath the photosphere as magnetic ﬂux emerges, thus ac-
counting for hidden return currents, as illustrated in the nu-
merical simulation output in Figure 1(b). Wheatland et al.

Figure 1. Figure from T¨or¨ok et al. (2014) showing a bipolar AR comprised of a ﬂux rope. Panel (a) shows a cartoon of a pre-emergence ﬂux
rope, its associated magnetic ﬁeld lines (rainbow), and direct (orange) and return (blue) currents. Panel (b) shows the results from a numerical
simulation of AR formation from Leake et al. (2013) and highlights the distribution of electric current streamlines post-ﬂux emergence in an
AR. The direct currents are shown in orange and the return currents are shown in green. The return currents are trapped beneath the photosphere
after magnetic ﬂux emerges.

(2000) found that most of the simulated ARs in their study
were non-neutralized, further supporting Melrose’s scenario.
More recent numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simu-
lations support Melrose’s scenario as well, showing that non-
neutralized currents emerge alongside the development of
substantial magnetic shear along an AR’s polarity inversion
line (PIL), the line that divides dominant magnetic polarities
in ARs (e.g., Georgoulis et al. 2012; T¨or¨ok et al. 2014; Dal-
masse et al. 2015). These studies also suggest a link between
PIL shear — the average angle between the observed vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld and a model force-free potential magnetic
ﬁeld near the PIL — and ﬂare/CME productivity in ARs.

It has also been suggested that CME productivity may de-
pend on the distribution of direct and return currents in ARs
(Schrijver & Siscoe 2010). Previous CME simulations have
utilized ﬂux rope conﬁgurations which do not contain re-
turn currents (e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005; Manchester et al.
2008). The presence of signiﬁcant PIL shear in ARs prior
to CME eruption implies the existence of non-potential mag-
netic ﬁelds, indicating the presence of the magnetic free en-
ergy required for eruption. The simulations mentioned in
the previous paragraph also indicate that PIL shear develops
along with non-neutralized currents. However, if currents are
assumed to be neutralized, these requirements for CME erup-
tion may not be suitable (Schrijver & Siscoe 2010).

The aforementioned theoretical studies suggest a rela-
tionship between current neutralization, PIL shear, and
ﬂare/CME productivity. To understand this relationship fur-
ther, we base our work on a pilot observational study by Liu
et al. (2017), who used a sample of 4 ARs, 2 of which were
emerging and 2 of which were well-developed. The authors
found that CME-active ARs had non-neutralized currents in
both individual polarities and the entire AR, while CME-
quiet ARs were close to neutral (i.e., |DC/RC| was close to
1). The authors also found that the difference in PIL shear
between CME-active and CME-quiet ARs was much less
pronounced, suggesting that the degree of current neutral-
ization in ARs may serve as a better proxy for determining

sample. A small subset of the ARs in this sample represent extreme

the ability of ARs to produce CMEs than PIL shear. How-
ever, the sample used by Liu et al. (2017) was small, and
more work needs to be done to further understand how these
parameters are related to ﬂare/CME productivity in ARs.

To expand on the pilot study by Liu et al. (2017), we
track 15 ﬂare-active and 15 ﬂare-quiet ARs across the so-
lar disk and determine the degree of current neutralization
(|DC/RC|) and PIL shear over each AR’s on-disk lifetime.
Among the 15 ﬂare-active ARs, 11 are also CME-active; all
other ARs are CME-quiet (see Table 1). We additionally con-
duct a statistical analysis of our measured parameters and as-
sess both the statistical and systematic uncertainties in our
results. In doing so, we place further constraints on whether
electric current neutralization is a good proxy for assessing
the ability of ARs to produce ﬂares/CMEs.

2. DATA & METHODS

2.1. Data

We consider a sample of 15 ﬂare-active and 15 ﬂare-quiet
ARs. We deﬁne ﬂare-active ARs as ARs which produce
ﬂares greater than or equal to M-class (i.e., ﬂares with X-
ray ﬂuxes greater than 10−5 W/m2) and deﬁne ﬂare-quiet
ARs as ARs which do not produce ﬂares larger than C-class
(i.e., ﬂares with X-ray ﬂuxes less than 10−5 W/m2). To se-
lect our sample of ARs, we use the HELIO Solar Activity

ELECTRIC CURRENT NEUTRALIZATION IN SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS

Archive1, which produces daily reports of the ﬂares produced
by a given AR.

To assess the ﬂare productivity for each AR, we use so-
lar X-ray ﬂux data from the Geostationary Operational En-
vironmental Satellite (GOES)2 to determine a ’ﬂare index’
(FI) for each AR (e.g., Schrijver 2007). The FI for each AR
is derived by adding the number of ﬂares produced by the
AR weighted by the X-Ray magnitude of each ﬂare. C-class
ﬂares have a weight of 1, M-class ﬂares have a weight of 10,
and X-class ﬂares have a weight of 100. We also use several
online CME catalogs (e.g., Robbrecht et al. 2009; Olmedo
et al. 2008) and Table 1 in Toriumi et al. (2017) to assess the
CME-productivity of each AR. All online catalogs are open-
access. The distribution of our selection criteria among ARs
in our sample is shown in Table 1.

To determine the degree of current neutralization, PIL
magnetic shear, and the unsigned magnetic ﬂux of all ARs
in our sample, we use vector magnetogram data (Hoeksema
et al. 2014) from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on the Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), which generates vector mag-
netograms every 720 seconds since 2010. We speciﬁcally
use the Space Weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP)
dataset (Bobra et al. 2014), which automatically tracks strong
concentrations of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld observed by
HMI across the solar disk. SHARP provides magnetogram
maps of the three spatial components of the magnetic ﬁeld
(Bx, By, Bz) and each component’s associated error. We
download data for our selected ARs at an hourly cadence.
These data are available from the Joint Science Operations
Center (JSOC)3.

2.2. Calculation of Current Neutralization

To measure the degree of current neutralization (|DC/RC|)
for each AR, we ﬁrst derive the vertical component of the cur-
rent density Jz from each HMI SHARP vector magnetogram
using Amp`ere’s Law (Maxwell 1856) shown in Equation 1,

Jz =

∂x

∂y

(cid:19)

|DC/RC| over each AR’s on-disk lifetime is then calcu-
lated from our derived Jz maps. To do this, we ﬁrst isolate
the positive and negative currents within each magnetic po-
larity. We only consider regions where the absolute value of
the magnetic ﬁeld is stronger than 200 G to avoid regions
with low signal-to-noise. We then calculate the net positive
and net negative currents within each polarity.

3 http://jsoc.stanford.edu/

To determine the sign associated with DC and DC, we de-
termine the dominant sign of Jz in each magnetic polarity
near the PIL, above which the direct current channel likely
resides. There are some ARs where this association is less
clear (see e.g., the right middle panel in Figure 3). However,
as shown in Liu et al. (2017), these ARs are often neutralized,
thus making the choice of sign for DC and RC interchange-
able. Once the correct sign of DC and RC is determined, we
calculate |DC/RC| in each magnetic polarity. This calcula-
tion is described further in Equations 2 and 3.

To determine the degree of current neutralization in the
entire AR, |DC/RC|tot, we calculate the direct and return
currents in each polarity separately, and then determine their
cumulative ratio as illustrated in Equation 4,

|DC/RC|tot =

|DC|+ + |DC|−
|RC|+ + |RC|−

where the superscripts + and − denote values in positive

and negative magnetic polarities.

Although the SHARP pipeline automatically selects re-
gions of HMI magnetograms which contain ARs, for ARs
that are not well-isolated or whose magnetic conﬁguration is
more complex, further steps need to be taken to isolate the
magnetic ﬂux necessary for determining our parameters of
interest. We are primarily interested in magnetic ﬂux which
contributes to eruptions. For ARs which are more com-
plex/less well-isolated, we locate the ﬂaring part of the AR in
extreme ultraviolet data from the Atmospheric Imaging As-
sembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on SDO and manually se-
lect the relevant sub-region that is involved in the eruption.
Other model-dependent methods have also been developed to
achieve this goal (e.g., Liu et al. 2017). We discuss the uncer-
tainties attributed to our region selection method in Section
4.

2.3. Calculation of PIL Magnetic Shear

To calculate the magnetic shear along the PIL of an AR, we
ﬁrst locate the PIL. We start by isolating all Bz pixels whose
magnitude is greater than 150 Gauss. We then smooth the
masks of the positive and negative ﬂux using a top-hat ker-
nel and determine where the masks covering each polarity
overlap. We then smooth the overlap mask with a Gaussian

map of shear values is shown on the right; the strongest shear is located near the PIL. Values in the weak ﬁeld region (B < 200 G) are shown
in white. The value for shear in Table 2 is computed by taking a mean of shear values within the PIL mask weighted by the magnetic ﬁeld
strength. Extreme shear values in regions where Bz is close to zero are not included in the calculation of PIL shear.

kernel to ensure we encompass the PIL. We use this mask to
calculate PIL shear. An example of this mask is shown in the
left panel of Figure 2. PIL shear is determined using meth-
ods described in previous studies (e.g., Hagyard et al. 1984;
Wang et al. 1994; Liu et al. 2017), which deﬁne PIL shear
as the angle between the horizontal components of the ob-
served magnetic ﬁeld and a modeled potential magnetic ﬁeld
based on photospheric Bz. We base our code for computing
PIL shear off of code written for the SHARP pipeline (Bobra
et al. 2014). An example map of PIL shear values is shown
in the right panel of Figure 2.

2.4. Calculation of Uncertainty

We derive the statistical uncertainty in |DC/RC| and PIL
shear from the statistical uncertainty in cylindrical equal area
(CEA) coordinates (see Sun (2013) for a thorough descrip-
tion of the SHARP coordinate system and pipeline process).
The HMI pipeline provides uncertainties as variances and co-
variances on the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude, ﬁeld inclination,
ﬁeld azimuth from the Stokes inversion process (Hoeksema
et al. 2014). We propagate these errors through our measure-
ments as follows.

We assume the uncertainties in an individual HMI native
pixel follow a Gaussian distribution and ﬁrst generate a cor-
related random sample (N ∼ 100) using the provided vari-
ances and covariances. This step creates an ensemble of new
magnetograms. We then transform individual magnetograms
in this ensemble into CEA coordinates, calculate the sample
parameters of interest, and calculate the variance in the series
of sample parameters. The CEA-coordinate transformation
code is adapted from SolarSoft IDL code (author X. Sun)
and is available on Github4. The median statistical uncer-
tainty for |DC/RC|+, |DC/RC|−, |DC/RC|tot, and PIL

4 https://github.com/eavallon/CEA map

Shear is 10−4, 10−4, 6.4 × 10−5, and 5.3 × 10−3◦ respec-
tively. These uncertainties are 99.5% smaller than the sys-
tematic uncertainties presented in Table 2 and do not affect
our results signiﬁcantly.

The systematic uncertainty is computed using other meth-
ods. The primary source of systematic uncertainty is the pe-
riodicity introduced by the orbital velocity of SDO around
Earth (for details, see Hoeksema et al. 2014). To quantify
this uncertainty, we calculate the variance in our measure-
ments within a 24-hour window. This is the uncertainty re-
ported in Table 2. We discuss further sources of systematic
uncertainty in Section 4.

3. RESULTS

We summarize the results for our full sample of ﬂare-
active and ﬂare-quiet ARs in Table 2. Our sample is grouped
by ﬂare activity and organized based on their CME activity
and their National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) AR number. Our presented results include the pres-
ence of CMEs, |DC/RC| for each magnetic polarity and the
entire AR, PIL shear, total unsigned ﬂux, ﬂare index, and
sunspot classiﬁcation. For ﬂare-active ARs, the values are re-
ported on the day of CME onset or the day of the maximum
magnitude ﬂare produced by that AR. For ﬂare-quiet ARs,
the values are reported on the day when the ﬂux is at 80% its
maximum value. We refer to these values when we present a
single number for |DC/RC|, PIL shear, or unsigned ﬂux.

An example of a ﬂare-active and a ﬂare-quiet AR is shown
in Figure 3, which shows the magnetogram (top), derived Jz
map (middle), and |DC/RC| values for each magnetic po-
larity and the unsigned ﬂux over the entire on-disk lifetime
of each AR (bottom). The highlighted ARs are AR 12673
(ﬂare-active) and AR 11776 (ﬂare-quiet). The ARs in our
ﬂare-quiet sample show similar trends to AR 11776 in their
on-disk evolution of |DC/RC|+ and |DC/RC|−. The bot-
tom right panel of Figure 3 shows that the electric currents

aTotal magnetic ﬂux on the day of ﬂare/CME occurrence for ﬂare-active ARs or on the day of 80% maximum ﬂux emergence for ﬂare-quiet ARs calculated
from SDO/HMI SHARP magnetograms. This is calculated by taking the absolute value of Bz and summing all magnetic ﬁeld above 200 Gauss in Bz maps to
remove any contributions from noise. The magnetic ﬁeld measurement is then converted to magnetic ﬂux by multiplying it by the observed solar area in a single
pixel.

ARs from NOAA/USAF and Toriumi et al. (2017). β sunspot groups are simple bipoles with an easily identiﬁable PIL. γ sunspot groups are more complex,
with mixed positive and negative polarities and no easily identiﬁable PIL. δ sunspot groups contain at least one sunspot with multiple polarities inside the same
sunspot penumbra.

and NOAA AR number. We report the systematic uncertainty from the orbit of SDO around Earth as the associated error for each parameter. The

become more neutralized as magnetic ﬂux emerges (i.e., as
unsigned ﬂux increases in magnitude). We see the same trend
in 60% of ARs in the ﬂare-quiet sample. A similar trend in
|DC/RC| is not observed in our ﬂare-active sample. We also
do not observe any other trends in |DC/RC| in the ﬂare-
active sample.

We do, however, observe similarities in the structure of Jz
in our ﬂare-active sample. The middle left panel of Figure 3
shows the Jz map for AR 12673. We can see that the positive
and negative currents have a coherent structure around the
PIL of this AR, indicating the presence of “current ribbons”
as in a coherent ﬂux rope. We observe similar current ribbons
in 87% of ﬂare-active ARs and in 6% of ﬂare-quiet ARs. The

component of the magnetic ﬁeld. The middle panels show the derived map of Jz, the vertical component of the current density. The bottom
panels show |DC/RC| in the positive (red) and negative (blue) polarities of each AR and the unsigned ﬂux (gray) over the on-disk lifetime of
each AR. The |DC/RC| plots are smoothed by a boxcar kernel of 12 hours to more clearly show trends. Error bars are too small to be visible
on the plot and are thus omitted. Error values can be found in Table 2.

ARs in our sample that do not exhibit current ribbons have
similar disordered current distributions to AR 11776, whose
Jz map is shown in the middle right panel of Figure 3. These
ARs have current distributions which do not have any notice-
able structure, and the positive and negative currents appear
to be evenly distributed.

We arbitrarily deﬁne current-neutralized ARs as ARs
with a |DC/RC|tot value less than 1.10. Based on our
full sample, we ﬁnd that ﬂare/CME-active ARs tend to be
less current-neutralized than ﬂare/CME-quiet ARs. 73% of
ﬂare-quiet ARs are current-neutralized, while only 13% of
ﬂare-active ARs are current neutralized. The distribution of
|DC/RC|tot for our entire sample is shown in the left panel
of Figure 4. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on these dis-
tributions yields a p-value of 0.051, which indicates that the
|DC/RC|tot values for ﬂare-active and ﬂare-quiet ARs are
sampled from different distributions at a 90% signiﬁcance

level but are not sampled from different distributions at a
95% signiﬁcance level.

The values for PIL shear also differ between the ﬂare-
active and ﬂare-quiet sample. The distribution of PIL shear
for our entire sample is shown in the right panel of Figure 4.
A KS test on these distributions yields a p-value of 0.075, in-
dicating that PIL shear values for ﬂare-active and ﬂare-quiet
ARs are sampled from different distributions at a 90% signif-
icance level but are not sampled from different distributions
at a 95% signiﬁcance level.

are shown in Figure 6. We can see in the bottom left and bot-
tom right panels in Figure 6 that the unsigned ﬂux is higher
for ﬂare-active ARs than for ﬂare-quiet ARs, further indi-
cated by a KS test p-value of 0.0002. The distribution in
unsigned ﬂux also follows the distribution in |DC/RC|tot,
but does not linearly correlate with it, based on a Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient of -0.071. Although |DC/RC|tot and
PIL shear differ signiﬁcantly between ﬂare-active and ﬂare-
quiet ARs, we see no clear correlation between these values,
as shown in the top left panel of Figure 6 and by a Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient of 0.221. We also see no clear corre-
lation between PIL shear and unsigned ﬂux, as shown in the
bottom right panel of Figure 6 and by a Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.105.

4. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS

Based on our analysis of 15 ﬂare-active and 15 ﬂare-
quiet ARs, we ﬁnd that ﬂare-active/CME-active ARs are
less current-neutralized than ﬂare-active/CME-quiet ARs
or ﬂare-quiet/CME-quiet ARs. These results support the
ﬁndings in Liu et al. (2017). The difference in |DC/RC|
for ﬂare-active/CME-active ARs and ﬂare-active/CME-quiet
ARs indicates that the degree to which AR currents are neu-
tralized are systematically different in these two populations.
Prediction of ﬂare/CME production based on |DC/RC|
alone, however, can be difﬁcult as there is some overlap
between the two populations.

We note that ﬂares and CMEs do not always occur together
even for the most energetic events. This is especially appar-
ent for AR 12192, which has an exceptionally high ﬂare in-
dex of 594, but does not produce any CMEs (Sun et al. 2015).
We also ﬁnd that CME-eruptive ARs exhibit deﬁned cur-
rent ribbons while CME-quiet ARs do not, as shown in Fig-
ure 3, suggesting the presence of a pre-eruption coherent ﬂux

Figure 5. Histogram showing the distribution in |DC/RC|tot val-
ues for CME-active (red) and CME-quiet (orange) ARs in our ﬂare-
active sample. CME-active ARs are less current-neutralized than
CME-quiet ARs.

ﬂare-active ARs is shown in Figure 5. Such ﬂare-active and
CME-quiet ARs have also been more thoroughly character-
ized in previous studies (see e.g., Sun et al. 2015). All ﬂare-
active and most CME-active ARs also have higher ﬂare in-
dices than ﬂare/CME-quiet ARs, indicating that they produce
more ﬂares of a higher magnitude. Flare-active ARs ﬁnally
have more complex magnetic conﬁgurations than ﬂare-quiet
ARs, as indicated by the Sunspot Classiﬁcation column in
Table 2. All ﬂare-active ARs are classiﬁed as γ sunspot
groups, with 80% also exhibiting a δ spot. This contrasts
with the ﬂare-quiet sample, where only 33% of these ARs
have a sunspot classiﬁcation of γ or δ.

We also compare |DC/RC|tot and PIL shear with the total
unsigned ﬂux in each AR to determine whether any correla-
tions are present. Scatter plots showing these comparisons

active/CME-quiet (green), and ﬂare-quiet/CME-quiet (purple) ARs. There is no signiﬁcant linear correlation between any of these parameters
based on Pearson correlation coefﬁcients of -0.071 for unsigned ﬂux and |DC/RC|tot, 0.221 for PIL shear and |DC/RC|tot, and 0.105 for
PIL shear and unsigned ﬂux. Error bars smaller than the circles are omitted, but can be found in Table 2.

rope. This is a necessary condition for CME eruption in mod-
els that evoke the kink or torus instability (Schrijver & Siscoe
2010). This also follows the distribution of currents shown in
Figure 1, with the direct currents conﬁned to the center of the
ﬂux rope and return currents in a surrounding sheath.

The presence of non-neutralized currents in our sample
of ARs is additionally consistent with previous simulations
which argue that return currents get trapped beneath the pho-
tosphere during ﬂux emergence, thus leading to the presence
of a non-neutralized current along with substantial PIL shear.
The decreasing trends observed in the early evolution of
|DC/RC| in ﬂare/CME-quiet ARs, to our knowledge, have
not been addressed in previous studies. Previous simulations
show that non-neutralized currents develop alongside ﬂux
emergence (e.g., Melrose 1991, 1995; Longcope & Welsch
2000), while the ARs in our ﬂare-quiet sample become more
neutralized as magnetic ﬂux emerges. This behavior can
also be seen in AR 11072, which is discussed in Liu et al.
(2017). There is some indication of this behavior in T¨or¨ok
et al. (2014) and Knizhnik et al. (2018). However, none of
these simulations indicate that currents should become neu-
tralized alongside ﬂux emergence. One possible explanation
is that the measurement of substantial currents prior to sig-
niﬁcant ﬂux emergence is due to extraneous ﬂux patches, or
is further affected by noise. Improved uncertainty constraints

or existing simulations of CME-quiet ARs should clarify this
issue.

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in PIL shear for ﬂare/CME-
active and ﬂare/CME-quiet ARs as well. This supports the
ﬁndings in Liu et al. (2017) and previous simulations (Dal-
masse et al. 2015). Our results, however, contradict other
theoretical studies which show that the presence of non-
neutralized currents in ARs is directly correlated with PIL
shear (e.g., Wiegelmann 2004). A larger sample could clar-
ify this discrepancy.

Our sample was selected based on the presence of ﬂares
in ARs. Since our results primarily have implications for the
CME-productivity of ARs, selecting another large sample of
low M-class to C-class ﬂaring ARs with and without CMEs
could provide further conclusions. Data-driven models of
CME-active and CME-quiet ARs can also be used to fur-
ther characterize these ARs (Fisher et al. 2015). High resolu-
tion data based on multi-line observations from the upcom-
ing Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) may allow for
measurement of current distribution at different heights in the
solar atmosphere (Tritschler et al. 2016). This should further
test the trapping scenario described in T¨or¨ok et al. (2014).

Along with variations introduced from the orbit of SDO
around Earth mentioned in Section 2.4, our selection method
for our integration region is also a source of uncertainty (see

11158. The top panels show magnetograms of Bz and the bottom panels show plots of |DC/RC| over the on-disk lifetime of AR 11158. The
mask used by Liu et al. (2017) is indicated by the yellow line in the top right panel. We perform our measurements over the entire region plotted
in the top left panel. The computed value of |DC/RC| is dependent on the region selection method used.

Section 2.2). To quantify how much this affects our mea-
surements, we included in our sample one of the ARs in Liu
et al. (2017), AR 11158. Liu et al. (2017) used a nonlinear
force-free extrapolation to determine a magnetically closed
central region around the ﬂaring PIL. A comparison between
this model-selected region and our selected region and the
effects on our measurement of |DC/RC| is shown in Figure
7. We ﬁnd that our values for |DC/RC| are a factor of two
smaller than those reported in Liu et al. (2017). We expect
the alternative method will increase the |DC/RC| values in
ﬂare/CME-active ARs, while affecting less the quiet ones.
Thus it will likely strengthen our conclusion.

We additionally consider image resolution effects as a
source of uncertainty. To analyze the effects of image res-
olution on our measurement of |DC/RC|−, we decrease the
resolution of the magnetograms of two example ARs, AR
12673 and AR 11776 by a factor of two and a factor of
four, the results of which are shown in Figure 8. We ﬁnd
that decreasing the image resolution increases the values of
|DC/RC|−, |DC/RC|+, and |DC/RC|tot in general, once
a signiﬁcant amount of ﬂux has emerged (after day 3 for
AR 12673 and day 1.5 for AR 11776). The spatial averag-

ing smooths out small scale ﬁeld structure, which creates a
larger impact on the minority/less structured return currents.
This is consistent with the ﬁndings from Georgoulis et al.
(2012). The authors found that decreasing the resolution in-
creased the current ”non-neutrality factor”, an index similar
|DC/RC| behaves in a less predictive way
to |DC/RC|.
prior to signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence. It is unclear why that is,
but the result is indeed more susceptible to noise and system-
atic effects. We caution against using |DC/RC| values at the
early emergence phase.

This sample, while a larger sample than what was used in
previous studies, is still subject to errors introduced in sta-
tistical analyses due to the small sample size. Future studies
with larger samples can help to further understand the param-
eters measured in this study and their distribution within the
entire population of observed ARs.

We modify the resolution by binning the original magnetogram of each AR. We ﬁnd that |DC/RC|− increases with decreasing resolution. We
note that although AR 11776 reaches values similar to non-neutralized ARs, those values are reached prior to any signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence
(see bottom right panel of Figure 3) and are likely dominated by noise.
