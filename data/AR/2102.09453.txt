ARTICLE HISTORY
Compiled February 19, 2021

ABSTRACT
Corporate training relates to employees acquiring essential skills to operate equip-
ment or eﬀectively performing required tasks both competently and safely. Unlike
formal education, training can be incorporated in the task workﬂow and performed
during working hours. Increasingly, organizations adopt diﬀerent technologies de-
velop both individual skills and improve their organization. Studies indicate that
Augmented Reality (AR) is quickly becoming an eﬀective technology for training
programs. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to screen works published
on AR for corporate training. We describe AR training applications, discuss current
challenges, literature gaps, opportunities, and tendencies of corporate AR solutions.
We structured a protocol to deﬁne keywords, semantics of research, and databases
used as sources of this SLR. From a primary analysis, we considered 1952 articles
in the review for qualitative synthesis. We selected 60 among the selected articles
for this study. The survey shows a large number of 41.7% of applications focused
on automotive and medical training. Additionally, 20% of selected publications use
a camera-display with a tablet device, while 40% refer to head-mounted-displays,
and many surveyed approaches (45%) adopt marker-based tracking. Results indi-
cate that publications on AR for corporate training increased signiﬁcantly in recent
years. AR has been used in many areas, exhibiting high quality and provides viable
approaches to On-The-Job training. Finally, we discuss future research issues related
to increase relevance regarding AR for corporate training.

1. Introduction

Manufacturing companies face serious challenges related to ever-changing demands by
customers and suppliers alike. New technological changes and suggested interventions
aim to exploit the economic potential resulting from rapidly advancing information
and communication technology in the industry. Training the workforce is not a one-
time issue to be addressed. Instead, it is an ongoing eﬀort that must be nurtured and
integrated into the corporate culture.

Indeed, it must continuously be on the managers’ table. Certainly, on-the-job train-
ing has the potential to both improve worker productivity and save resources. Today
we witness what could be the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution coming on the

heels of information technologies (IT). This revolution is characterised by Internet
technologies becoming pervasive. Indeed, IT is becoming easier to use and permeate
our everyday lives via intelligent components, robots, the internet of things (IoT), and
interactive technologies.

These developments lie at the core of emerging smart factories where physical and
digital systems become integrated to enable both mass customisation and faster prod-
uct development (Demartini et al., 2017). Also, industries are investing in new tech-
nologies to improve complex processes (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2018). According to Car-
doso et al. de Souza Cardoso et al. (2020), Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the
leading technologies in this context. This AR lead happens because it can be applied
in diﬀerent industrial environments to improve process ﬂexibility, providing informa-
tion to manufacturing, improving product inspection, and providing more eﬃcient
logistics while supporting maintenance process monitoring.

AR is currently used in many diﬀerent niche applications and diverse goals such
as emulating critical situations with low human risks, creating promising opportuni-
ties to train medical professionals in a safe environment, providing general academic
resources, serving as maintenance facilitator devices, in the manufacturing industries
such as automotive and aeronautical as well.

AR is known as a technology that allows computer-generated virtual imagery to
overlay physical objects in real-time accurately (Zhou et al., 2015). In AR most visual
sensations and sensory stimuli come from the real world, and the virtual elements
contribute less, the virtual object is set as if it were part of the real world. In Vir-
tual Reality (VR), most sensory information is computer-generated where the virtual
environment is presented as if the user were part of it.

AR applications are becoming even more aﬀordable, thanks to more powerful hard-
ware, including processors, head-mounted-displays (HMD) and smaller form-factors
such as smartphones. Thanks to these progresses and even more sophisticated user
interfaces AR is mounting to new levels of usability (Wanderley et al., 2006).

AR, as an interaction paradigm, is predicted to be one of the enabling technologies
that will power the transformation supported by the Industry 4.0 initiative (Davies,
2015), which is expected to revolutionise the current production systems. Indeed, AR
is welcome in manufacturing (Damiani et al., 2018) as it can help humans to:

(1) Speed up reconﬁguration of production lines;
(2) Support shop-ﬂoor operations;
(3) Implement virtual training for assembling parts;
(4) Manage the warehouse eﬃciently;
(5) Support advanced diagnostics integrated into modules with the working envi-

ronment (Damiani et al., 2015).

This SLR focuses on the topic: Implementing virtual training for assembling parts.
It is not circumscribed to industry settings but also delves on the medical, service, mil-
itary and many other corporate training applications. Our goal is to elaborate a com-
prehensive SLR on AR as a training paradigm focused providing just-in-time Rentroia-
Bonito et al. (2005) instructions to people so that they can perform activities more
eﬃciently with minimum supervision from senior staﬀ and with online assessment so
as to become a reliable foundation for On-the-Job Training (OJT).

In the context of this survey we look for training suites with the potential to be
used for OJT. This requires both the ability to update pedagogical content on short
notice and, more importantly, to integrate the module in the actual task workﬂow.

OJT makes it possible to oﬀer spontaneous explanations or demonstrations related to a
person’s job responsibilities and performance requirements. Proper OJT enables people
to hone their skills either by trial-and-error learning or by observing and imitating the
behaviours of others (Jacobs and Osman-Gani, 1999). Although not all the studies
selected in this survey target OJT, all show potential to be used in that context.

As both service providers and manufacturing systems switch from mass production
to mass customisation (Burger et al., 2017), this leads to more client-speciﬁc, tailor-
made products and services delivered to an even diverse and larger customer base. This
requires even more skilled workers to perform many diﬀerent tasks in widely diverse
contexts to meet market requirements. The human workforce is integrated with the
manufacturing systems, and people too need to be ﬂexible and adaptive (Yew et al.,
2016). AR technology, as highlighted in this paper, provides remarkable tools and
features to support the needs of this new workforce, by leveraging on and enhancing
the human cognitive abilities towards augmenting their abilities and productivity.

In this paper, we survey studies related to corporate training, including training pro-
grams provided by organisations to empower the workforce to meet client expectations
and to contribute to both the proﬁtability and the mission of the company.

AR technologies are scrutinised to identify the main beneﬁts as measured due to
their application. Furthermore, we try and expose the disadvantages noted by authors.
Moreover, to verify the current trend regarding the number of articles published, and
check on business acceptance of AR for training purposes, we classify surveyed articles
regarding AR conﬁgurations, quality of results, tracking methods used and the display
hardware employed in experiments.

2. Methodology

The ﬁrst step when conducting a systematic literature review is to deﬁne the research
objectives and circumscribe the problem being addressed (Ten´orio et al., 2016). This
systematic literature review assesses AR as used to promote work performance. This
paper aims to answer the following research questions:

(1) Is AR attracting more interest to be used as a corporate training recently?
(2) What are the main challenges to adopting AR in OJT?
(3) What are the main beneﬁts achieved by AR in OJT?
(4) Is AR a potencial tool to be used for OJT?

Before starting the systematic study we need to deﬁne a search strategy for primary
publications, documenting empirical studies germane to our questions (Kitchenham
and Charters, 2007).

We adopted a two-stage strategy: ﬁrst we deﬁned the keywords and the semantics
of research and then we selected which digital libraries, journals, and conferences to
search for studies considering the following factors:

• Availability of articles in bibliographic databases;
• Search availability from keywords to deﬁne a search string
• Relevance of bibliographic database (Kitchenham and Charters, 2007; Ten´orio

et al., 2016).

To deﬁne the search strings to be explored, the authors discussed and agreed on (1)
specifying a keyword string and (2) analyse, observe and evaluate the search results

3

from the same databases for both its relevance and its representativeness.

Based on the possible results and to structure the systematic review, the selected
string should feature a suﬃciently large corpus of articles and their content should
make it possible to answer the proposed research questions. After discussing the possi-
ble results within the authors and theirs limitations, the selected result string includes
all articles and journals that feature the words ((“AUGMENTED REALITY”) OR
(“MIXED REALITY”)) AND (TRAINING) as keywords or in their titles. We chose
ﬁve diﬀerent databases, considering the previously discussed criteria: ACM Digital
Library, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier (Science Direct), Elsevier Scopus, and SpringerLink.

Aiming to improve the results, we deﬁned diﬀerent selection criteria (inclusion, ex-
clusion, and quality) based on the research question, String search and bibliographical
databases. Our objective was to identify primary papers that would provide direct
evidence about the research questions, also to reduce the likelihood of bias (Kitchen-
ham and Charters, 2007). Speciﬁcally, we used the guidelines for performing system-
atic literature reviews in software engineering (Kitchenham and Charters, 2007) and
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)
(Liberati et al., 2009; Moher et al., 2010) as a methodological foundation for the
selection, evaluation, and exclusion phases.

As a means to facilitate this understanding, we summarise our ﬁndings in Table 1.
We read the paper titles to reduce article count. After ward, we evaluated the abstracts
for each initially retained article. Last, we read the introduction and conclusions of
each paper. After applying these ﬁlters, we read the remaining papers integrally. To
assess the quality of the ﬁnally chosen articles, we used ten criteria which we present
in Table 2. We describe them succinctly below:

RAT Is there a rationale and discussion on the assumptions upon which the study
was based? Does the study feature a speciﬁc goal to be achieved in the AR
scenario? (Ten´orio et al., 2016)

LL Are the study conclusions grounded on empirical research or does it feature a

“lessons learned” report based on expert opinion? (Ten´orio et al., 2016)

OBJ Is there a clear statement of the goals of the research? This is important to

ascertain to what extent they were met (Ten´orio et al., 2016)

MAT Are the materials and research methods clearly described? A clear and detailed
description would make it easier to better assess and reproduce the study results.
CTXT Is there an adequate description of the context (such as industry, laboratory
setting, and products used) in which the research was carried out? Again, a clear
description of context would support third party veriﬁcation and reproduction
of the study.

EMP Was the study empirically evaluated and its results quantiﬁed? An empirical

evaluation would strengthen the conclusions of a given study.

DISC Is there a discussion about the results of the study and its impacts? A clear
and reasoned argument on the validity and generalisability of the conclusions
signiﬁcantly adds to the contribution of the report.

LIM Are the limitations of this study explicitly discussed? Such a discussion provides
greater insights on the follow-up research and greatly adds to the contribution
of the study as reported (Ten´orio et al., 2016).

OUTC Does the research also add value to the industrial community? Does the
paper conclusions apply to, or identify process improvements? Can these be
extrapolated beyond the original scope?

AR Are the display and tracking techniques clearly described? A clear description

allows for better contextualisation and assessment of outcomes.

Each paper received one point for each criterion duly addressed. During this reading,
we collected data to provide the information needed for this classiﬁcation. Furthermore,
we only retained articles that scored a ﬁve minimum point grade for this SLR.

We searched each of the databases separately seeking articles from January 2014 to
August 2020 that would match our seed terms. We thus collected 1952 candidate pub-
lications, including duplicates. It is important to note that we restricted our search to
manuscripts written in English. Articles written in other languages did not contribute
to those initial 1952 texts.

We removed 85 duplicate articles, reducing the total number to 1867. After that, all
the scanning through titles and keywords have been done, and then articles identiﬁed
as irrelevant ones were excluded. This step was performed by one of us and double-
checked by another to avoid biased information or any misinterpretation trimming the
total candidate texts from 1867 to 310.

At least one author read the abstract and classiﬁed each of the the remaining essays.
This classiﬁcation and any doubts that arose were discussed within the group. We
excluded pieces not compliant with the scope of work, reducing the SLR to 180 entries.
From this point on, we retrieved each complete paper from the corpus and one of
us read both its introduction and conclusions to eliminate non-relevant studies. The
reader shared the classiﬁcations and we discussed possible doubts reducing the corpus
to 60 papers. Figure 1 depicts the selection process.

Finally, the remaining 60 papers were read in their entirety by two authors. We
retrieved the data assessing the quality of the 60 selected publications to verify and
illustrate their relevance according to the selected parameters. Any doubts or disagree-
ments were shared within the group to guarantee consistency in the ﬁnal information.
The parameters identiﬁed and a summary of studies included in the SLR are presented
in Table 2. As the papers were read, all the relevant information was registered, in
order to fulﬁl this systematic review goal and to structure the data to be analysed.

3. Results and Discussion

After reading and analysing each of the remaining 60 papers, we extracted and trans-
lated the data into information in a process guided by answer based on the research
questionnaires described previously. This will be detailed in the following subsections.
Figure 2(a) shows for each paper its country of origin. Notably, only twelve papers
come from outside Europe or North America. USA and Italy are responsible for 15
manuscripts. European researchers alone produced 34 studies as can be seen on Fig-
ure 2(b). This analysis is relevant to identify the locations of research centres focusing
on AR for corporate training. Thus, it becomes easier to highlight regions where AR in
corporate training is most relevant. Therefore, we can conclude that developed coun-

tries contribute a larger share than developing countries, suggesting that investments
to perform AR research are more prone to be made in locations with more resources
and more educated workers.

Figure 3 identiﬁes industries where AR is applied. Indeed, the automotive industry
has the potential to become the principal application for AR training in manufactur-
ing environments, featuring 11 papers. Another issue of note is that AR applications
supporting blended learning for medical training have garnered both public and sci-
entiﬁc interest as they are the subject of 13 publications. The remaining studies are
distributed more evenly among diverse economic sectors.

Figure 4 shows display conﬁgurations used in research as well as the tracking meth-
ods applied. As we can see, HMDs are most commonly used, as they free both hands
to execute required tasks during the training activities. A tablet is the second most
used display both due its ﬂexibility and its low cost. Finally, projectors and moni-
tors make for a smaller share of display technologies. Although the use of HMD leads
the applications, the sum of non-immersive displays is superior than immersive ones
Further analysis of display technologies can be found later in this section.

Marker-based tracking methods are seemingly the most popular. Indeed, marker-
based tracking is a well-established mechanism in AR (Schmalstieg et al., 2011) and
its popularity may be due to the reduced cost (Pinto et al., 2008) besides that cameras
can detect ﬁducial markers in real time with no diﬃculty (Pfeiﬀer and Renner, 2014).
Although 12 publications do not clearly describe the tracking method adopted, the

for the near future. 15 papers feature a more computationally demanding technology,
markerless tracking, that combines 2D and 3D recognition Sensor-based approaches
are less popular and include electromagnetic and inertial tracking.

The following subsections discuss the four Research Questions (RQ) in detail, dis-

cussing the relevant ﬁndings in the surveyed literature.

3.1. RQ1 - Is AR attracting more interest to be used as a corporate

training recently?

As it is observed in Figure 5, there is a steady increase in publications on corporate
training over the past few years. Indeed, from the initial year considered in this SLR
until the entire last year, their number has grown signiﬁcantly. Also worth noting,
the number of publications featuring AR and training in either their title or keywords
has steadily increased over the years, illustrating a growing interest of the scientiﬁc
community.

Putting into perspective, the percentage of studies regarding corporate training has
been stable from 2.43% to 1,75% in recent year , following the increasing trend in the
AR articles published. While in 2014 the selection rate was 2/82, in 2019 this number
reached 13/737. Thus AR is increasing as the main tool in training, both causing
and reﬂecting the growing number of publications studying its eﬀectiveness. Thus we
can answer positively Research Question 1: Is AR attracting more interest to be used
as a corporate training recently. Moreover, training is a growing area of application

for AR, taking into account the share of training related papers among AR scientiﬁc
publications.

3.2. RQ2 - What are the main challenges to AR in OJT?

Only 16 of the selected articles do not address diﬃculties in developing training appli-
cations. On the other hand, the remaining 60, identify at least one challenge. In general,
the following issues have been reported on using AR as a training tool: adapting non-
tech savvy users to AR technology (Wright et al., 2017), training engagement (Rogado
et al., 2017), ﬁeld of vision (Wang et al., 2018), visual occlusion limitations (Herron,
2016), ergonomics (Stone et al., 2017), environment interference (Bifulco et al., 2014),
dependence on internet connection (Ullo et al., 2019), dependence on batteries, fear of
changes (Pena-Rios et al., 2018), handling perspective and depth (Abhari et al., 2014),
management engagement (Li et al., 2018), high cost of customization (Longo et al.,
2017), synchronizing reality and virtuality (Hou et al., 2017), choosing the training
scope (Ram´ırez et al., 2015), resource costs when updating AR training content (Ullo
et al., 2019), acquiring trainers for interpersonal interaction (Mourtzis et al., 2018),
camera focus (Hoˇrejˇs´ı, 2015), software issues (Ullo et al., 2019) and ergonomic issues
of wearables when used continuously (Jetter et al., 2018).

Training people non-familiar with the technology was a challenge identiﬁed in eight
of the studies including Perdikakis et al. (2015). Since AR training systems commonly
use software and require minimum digital expertise, people experiencing diﬃculties
with IT are either prone to reject AR, be too ashamed to ask for help, or do not
engage in the experience (Wright et al., 2017). The interest in and value perception of
AR technologies are likely to be higher for both students and technology-savvy people
and may also vary according to gender (Habig, 2019).

Another issue regarding engagement is percentage of studies that highlighted either

low enthusiasm or a low perception of beneﬁts by trainers. Indeed, 8.3% of the studies
discussed this ﬁnding. Notably, several studies indicate that either the managers and
the corporate directors actively support and endorse the new training technology or
the trainers/operators will tend to reject it.

Another aspect covered by the analysis is the hardware required. Displays, if not
chosen carefully, can pose signiﬁcant obstacles to training. In eﬀect, 12 studies men-
tioned troubles with the displays selected including Herron (2016). The problems either
related to the wrong choice of display (ex: instead of using a handheld display, a wear-
able would ﬁt the function better) or troubles pertaining to the hardware proper, or
reported discomfort with wearable devices during continued use.

Other issues mentioned in the literature include display price point. Since many
expensive displays are exclusively used for specialised niche training applications, they
might not be cost-eﬀective.

Ten studies reported issues aﬀecting AR markers. Both complexity of marker tech-
nology and interference from the environment are the leading causes of problems re-
ported in Westerﬁeld et al. (2015). Placing markers in corners or in open environments
can cause misreadings (Bifulco et al., 2014). Also, the cost and the environmental con-
straints cameras to establish reliable tracking were also discussed. On the other hand,
software can also be a source of complications. Eleven studies mentioned the software
presenting at least one problem, as discussed by Hoˇrejˇs´ı (2015). In this case, the main
issue was due to inﬂexible conﬁgurations or applications designed for on rails exe-

cution and not being able to handle unusual conditions or inputs in a graceful way.
Other problems reported oﬀ-the-shelf software lacking customisation for AR, such as
video calling applications. Customisation was pointed out as a strong feature in 18
articles e.g. (Torres-Jim´enez et al., 2018) given the added ﬂexibility. However, eight
papers identify room for improvement as seen in the Longo et al. (2017). Customising
software can be diﬃcult mainly due to the deep knowledge required to edit the train-
ing software, or the preparation need to change training sequences or dialogues. Even
though when inside a training session it may be possible to insert additional informa-
tion or change feedback triggered from markers relatively easy and cheap, changing
the business logic of the training software or physically moving tracking devices for a
diﬀerent training module, can be much harder and expensive.

Internet access is ﬂagged as an issue in two studies (Pena-Rios et al., 2018; Ullo et al.,
2019), mainly due to unstable connections, or insuﬃcient bandwidth as AR requires
video streaming when deployed remotely, or when it requires external processing.

The 3D perception and perspective are mentioned as challenges by 14 studies
namely Kobayashi et al. (2018). Properly matching virtual content with real settings
to meet training requirements is essential to avoiding perception troubles. Simulator
(3D) sickness (Lee, 2019) needs to be avoided, as the distortion between real objects
and virtual content minimises breaks in the ﬂow of work and increases the trainee’s
attention to the instructional content.

Table 3 synthesises the main points extracted during our survey regarding challenges

to the adoption of AR. We also describe them succinctly below:

LELP Low enthusiasm or a low perception of beneﬁts by trainers; in many contexts
this may mean scepticism towards unproven technologies or a steep learning
curve characteristic of some early systems;

EIFC Engagement issues or fear of changes; Indeed in many corporate environments,
introducing a new technology can be met with resistance by people who perceive
their job security being threatened;

3DP 3D perception regarding the perspective and deepness; These maybe related to

display quality, registrationb problems or both;

HWI Hardware issues; Some of the early hardware could be quirky and prone to

failure;

DMR Diﬃculties regarding the marker readings; These might either be caused by

poor illumination or unfortunate choice of surfaces;

DBC Diﬃculties with broadband connection and data transfer; Perceived lag can
cause simulator sickness, poor registration or even missing key animations; net-
work latency can exacerbate these issues;

11

CI Customisation issues; As AR training environments can be complex, budgetary

issues can lead to under-featured poorly adapted software;

SOFT Software issues; Bugs or poorly documented features can lead to unantici-

pated behavior;

TPNF Training people non-familiar with the technology; Some more complex sys-
tems may have a steep learning curve, which prevents non-specialised people to
take full advantage of AR for training of job-speciﬁc tasks;

NDNC Not described or not clear.

3.3. RQ3 - What are the main beneﬁts achieved by AR in OJT?

From examining the 60 articles we conclude that AR, although with diﬀerent descrip-
tions, provides the following advantages: reduced training costs (Ullo et al., 2019),
facilitated customization (Uva et al., 2018), raised eﬀectiveness (Doshi et al., 2017b),
low-risk when exercising critical safety issues (Rogado et al., 2017), attractive to
speciﬁc groups (Wright et al., 2017), ﬂexible information display (Pena-Rios et al.,
2018), improved worker conﬁdence (Torres-Jim´enez et al., 2018), fast access to in-
formation (Sebillo et al., 2016), support to decision-making (Kobayashi et al., 2018),
improved skill transfer process (Pena-Rios et al., 2018), real-time interaction (Sebillo
et al., 2016), empowering operators (Syberfeldt et al., 2016), displaying immersive en-
vironments (Li et al., 2018), familiarisation with the work routine (Abhari et al., 2014),
allowing non-specialised staﬀ to perform speciﬁc tasks (Ullo et al., 2019), manpower
savings (Hou et al., 2017), decreased training time (Wang et al., 2016), decreased
perceived distances (Hou et al., 2017), decreased error rates (Leitritz et al., 2014),
reduced cognitive workload (Okazaki and Takaseki, 2017), easy to store and trans-
port (Perdikakis et al., 2015), decreased set-up time (Quandt et al., 2018), welcome
by users (Mitsuhara et al., 2017), increased motivation (Bacca et al., 2018), friendly
remote assistance and better long term retention of information (Kobayashi et al.,
2018) among others. In this subsection, we will discuss how the previously mentioned
beneﬁts are documented throughout the articles and analyse how these aﬀect the
perceived suitability of AR to training in the working environment. Although 15 ar-
ticles presented at least a quantiﬁed beneﬁt, 59 mentioned qualitatively perceived or
immeasurable gains.

Tallying the information from (Ferrati et al., 2019; Hoˇrejˇs´ı, 2015; Koutitas et al.,
2020; Lee, 2019; Longo et al., 2017; Mourtzis et al., 2018; Ram´ırez et al., 2015; Uva
et al., 2018; Westerﬁeld et al., 2015) time savings with respect to traditional ap-
proaches average 28.48% (considering only the ﬁnal number provided in the respective
paper). An additional 27 articles mentioned unquantiﬁed gains related to time spent
as compared to traditional methods. The main issue regarding time measurements is
that the training suite can advance stages as the operator progresses, as all modules
are geared to individual learning and the information presented is focused, in order to
narrow attention to the training goals. Another characteristic observed is that training
modules can use display resources to provide unsolicited information at any moment.
Eﬀectively, there is no need to wait for human-generated events to happen, as the
simulation can evolve in real time. Another key beneﬁt highlighted by studies is the
perceived lower error rate during task execution when using AR. In eﬀect, Balian et al.
(2019); Doshi et al. (2017b); Ferrati et al. (2019); Koutitas et al. (2020); Leitritz et al.
(2014); Mourtzis et al. (2018); Uva et al. (2018) measured the operator errors to be, on

average, about 47.85% lesser than conventional settings during the task execution. 20
articles mentioned a decrease in related mistakes in comparison with traditional meth-
ods. AR can provide speciﬁc, relevant and customised information about every step
of the training, which can explain why AR-based training tends to yield less mistakes.
Another corroborating characteristic is that AR presents information graphically and
thus makes it easier to understand than text-based delivery.

Cost-related issues are also relevant. Besides the inherent money savings due to

13

learning time reduction and decreased error rates, the costs regarding learning content
production can be addressed. One study Ram´ırez et al. (2015) measured these to be
41% lesser as compared to traditional methods. Besides that, 25 studies mentioned,
without measuring, that total cost of training was lower, namely Stone et al. (2017).
An advantage that is immeasurable at this point but worth mentioning is time
savings by senior operators cited by 4 essays (Boonbrahm et al., 2019; Ferrati et al.,
2019; Ullo et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020) in the production environment who would
otherwise be engaged to help and provide information to new employees.

The ﬂexibility aﬀorded by AR was both welcome and noticed in 19 articles, includ-
ing Torres-Jim´enez et al. (2018), which stated that AR makes content customisation
easier. Once the main body and training methodology are deﬁned, it becomes simpler
to change environments (Sebillo et al., 2016), change the information given, or even
update these in real-time depending on perceived requirements.

The possibility to simulate a given environment is quoted by 25 studies e.g. (Barsom
et al., 2016). Also, improvements in safety are quoted by 7 papers e.g. (Barsom et al.,
2016; Li et al., 2018; Rogado et al., 2017; Torres-Jim´enez et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
2020). These two characteristics are strongly related. As it becomes easier to simulate
an environment, speciﬁc conditions can be simulated too (Aebersold et al., 2018).
Hence it is possible to train the operator using comparatively inexpensive equipment
without incurring health or safety risks in case of misguidances (Stone et al., 2017). It
is possible to simulate events and manage stressful situations without incurring extra
costs beyond content production. Dangerous environments or unsafe activities can
also be simulated without major safety issues to the operator, as discussed in Stefan
et al. (2018), it is not necessary to expose novice operators to radiation, but training
is required on how to manage emergency situations in hazardous environments e.g.
nuclear power plants.

The cognitive advantages of AR are discussed in 29 articles. Indeed, many operators
welcome and experience positive attitudes towards AR-based learning as it requires
less cognitive resources to achieve results comparable to traditional methods (Okazaki
and Takaseki, 2017). A key advantage is that learning scenarios can be repeated as
many times as needed without embarrassment. Since the delivery is strongly visual
the scene can be placed exactly at the time and place relevant to training, avoiding
possible confusion. The same situation can also be played in diﬀerent ways, as a poka-
yoke1 to overcome any misunderstanding of the message the training is supposed to
impart (Jetter et al., 2018). Table 4 synthesises the main points extracted during our
literature survey regarding the main beneﬁts outlined above. We also describe them
brieﬂy below:

RTC Reduced training cost;
ECE Easy customisation and editing;
LER Lower error rate during task execution;
LTT Lower training time;
LCL Lower cognitive load;
ARFT AR provided environment facilities for training;
SAFTI Safety improvements;
BNDNC Beneﬁts not described or not clear.

1Poka-yoke is a Japanese term that means ”mistake-prooﬁng” or ”inadvertent error prevention”. A poka-yoke
is any mechanism in any process that helps an equipment operator avoid (yokeru) mistakes (poka).

3.4. RQ4 - Is AR a potential tool to be used for OJT?

Based on the answers to the three previous research questions, it is possible to conclude
AR has potential to become a useful tool for OJT in many settings. Its features and
beneﬁts seemingly mesh well with OJT requirements, and we can see that once devel-
opment environments support enough ﬂexibility (Tamaazousti et al., 2016), training
suites are geared towards the workplace experience (Barsom et al., 2016), the learn-
ing experience becomes job-oriented, learning module contents can be updated with

15

relative ease and training packages can be used without specialised supervision (Ullo
et al., 2019). The just-in-time based e-learning can be supported by AR technology
since the training modules just require the operator to be available and the training
station prepared (Mendoza et al., 2015).

The advantages highlighted in the RQ3 ﬁt well with most objectives of OJT. Indeed,
59 studies report strong beneﬁts as exempliﬁed by Quandt et al. (2018), and only 46
described diﬃculties, notably in Syberfeldt et al. (2016). Nonetheless, as far as the
result we analysed, 15 of these studies could quantify productivity gains e.g. (Leitritz
et al., 2014). On the other hand, none of the reported disadvantages could be precisely
measured during the published experiments. While current trends show AR as being
applied to individual training tasks, comprehensive OJT can be the next application
to enjoy widespread AR deployment.

3.5. Limitations of the study

Even though the authors intended to cast as wide a net as possible, the articles re-
viewed in this research are limited to the journals indexed in the databases: ACM
Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier (Science Direct), Elsevier Scopus, and Springer-
Link. This research is limited to experimental studies presented in article format, thus
possibly missing more anecdotal or corporate proprietary evidence. Although all se-
lected studies were integrally read, some info could be missing or misunderstood during
the analysis. As the ﬁeld evolves and given the rapid pace of AR development, future
iterations of this study could shed more light on our ﬁndings. In addition to that, this
SLR is limited to academic papers in a review intended to assess the imminent impact
of a technology in the industry.

4. Conclusion

From the analysis of the beneﬁts and disadvantages presented in this paper, it is clear
that AR is a maturing approach to corporate training scenarios as the technology over-
comes its growing pains and associated challenges. Indeed, at the current development
stage, well-thought-out planning stages before training programs and learning content
are deployed can maximise both skill improvement and workforce quality. This plan-
ning should include the correct evaluation of the target audience. Indeed, depending
on the digital skill levels of the target audience, AR applications can be complicated
and feature unnecessary layers or be straight and simple to address less sophisticated
or casual audiences.

The display selection can be critical to success and should consider both the training
scope, environmental, safety, and ergonomics issues. If the activity requires a hands-free
operation, we recommend either an HMD or a projector-based setting. If the training
is time-intensive, wearable devices can present ergonomic issues. If the budget does
not include speciﬁc hardware for each worker, or if the training has to be conducted si-
multaneously by many trainees, it should be desirable to adopt smartphones or tablets
as primary displays.

Tracking methods need attention while considering the environment. Variations in
lighting can interfere with the reading of markers depending on the camera used. The
surface on which to place the markers should be studied. If irregular surfaces are likely
to cause misreadings, other tracking devices such as a sensor-based or a markerless
tracker could be chosen.

16

The training environment should be correctly prepared to support any ﬂow of ac-
tion that the trainees shall undergo. Avoiding inﬂexible trainee-”on rails” experiences
should improve the learning experience.

Software development should take into account the ultimate training objectives and

accommodate the stakeholders mentioned above.

If developers are to heed these recommendations, they can increase the training’s

beneﬁts and minimise the challenges of using AR as an OJT useful tool.

Following current trends, design thinking should contribute better results to devel-
oping AR training software. Another issue to take into account is gamiﬁcationBarata
et al. (2013) as a device to optimise and to engage trainees. Moreover, just-in-time
solutions can facilitate software development regarding both the game engine and
training structure to decrease eﬀorts required to develop the software and increase the
application range of the training and its access to more developers.

Although the studies identiﬁed diﬀerent beneﬁts and some of them performed mea-
surements, there is still a strong need for a comprehensive survey that combines all
measurements and compares them with the traditional OJT training methods. The
challenge consists of AR-based training in an industrial OJT application for the mas-
tering of one activity, in which the following critical performance indicators shall be
directly compared with traditional training programs: (1) the cost, (2) the training
pace, (3) the time required, (4) the learning curve, (5) the cognitive workload, (6) the
perception regarding AR and (7) the technology acceptance.

As a means to develop future work relevance, AR will increasingly use smartphones
or other wearable devices to accommodate the growing adoption of AR everyday set-
tings and improve people’s familiarity with the technology. However, AR can still
evolve in fundamental ways to improve both the user and learning experiences. Fur-
ther Artiﬁcial Intelligence developments can make for more natural and sophisticated
dialogues and better coaching of trainees to identify possible pitfalls and proactively
suggest better ways to accomplish tasks. Further advances in HMDs and wearable
devices will surely make AR applications usable for extended periods, a typical worker
complaint since the inception of the ﬁeld. Finally, ever more advanced user interface
techniques, coupled with more natural interaction modalities going beyond speech
and gestures, should make for ever more natural user experiences, increasing worker
engagement, and productivity of AR-based learning environments.
