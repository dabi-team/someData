Abstract 

In this work, amorphous thin films in Mg-Si-O-N system typically containing > 15 at.%, Mg 

and 35 at.%, N were prepared in order to investigate especially the dependence of optical and 

mechanical  properties  on  Mg  composition.  Reactive  RF  magnetron  co-sputtering  from 

magnesium and silicon targets were used for the deposition of Mg-Si-O-N thin films. Films 

were deposited on float glass, silica wafers and sapphire substrates in an Ar, N2 and O2 gas 

mixture.  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy,  atomic  force  microscopy,  scanning  electron 

microscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and nanoindentation were employed to characterize 

the composition, surface morphology, and properties of the films. The films consist of N and  

Mg contents  up to 40 at.% and 28 at.%, respectively and have good adhesion to substrates and 

are  chemically  inert.  The  thickness  and  roughness  of  the  films  increased  with  increasing 

content of Mg. Both Hardness (16 – 21 GPa) and reduced elastic modulus (120 – 176 GPa) are 

strongly  correlated  with  the  amount  of  Mg  content.  The  refractive  index  up  to  2.01  and  

extinction coefficient up to 0.18 were found to increase with Mg content. The optical band gap 

(3.1  –  4.3)  decreases  with  increasing  the  Mg  content.  Thin  film  deposited  at  substrate 

temperature of 100 oC shows a lower value of  hardness ( 10 GPa), refractive index (1.75), and 

higher values of reduced elastic modulus (124 GPa) as compared to the thin film deposited at 

310 oC and 510 oC respectively, under identical synthesis parameters.  

Keywords:  Mg-Si-O-N  thin  films;  sputtering;  high  magnesium  content;  hardness;  modulus; 

refractive index; band gap.

1.   Introduction 

Reactive magnetron sputtering is an effective process to deposit oxides, nitrides and oxynitride 

thin films due to its advantages such as good uniformity, low deposition temperature and ability 

to deposit compact films with high mechanical/optical integrity and stability [1-4] For coatings 

on glass, oxynitrides are of particular interest [5-9]. Oxynitride coating is particular interest in 

optics,  photonics,  microelectronics,  waveguide  devices,  anti-reflection  coating,  nonvolatile 

memories  and  dielectrics  applications.  Silicon  oxynitride  (SiON)  and  silicon  aluminum 

oxynitride  (SiAlON)  thin  films  have  been  extensively  studied,  due  to  their  mechanical, 

chemical, thermal, electronic, and optical properties. These properties typically vary  greatly 

with the O/N substitution in most cases. In comparison with SiO2, Si3N4 and Si(Al)ON systems, 

less research  has been devoted to M-Si-O-N (M = Alkaline-earth or rare-earth cations) thin 

film synthesis [10, 11]. The addition of alkaline-earth or rare-earth cations to SiON thin films 

constitute  a  significant  extension  of  silicon  oxynitride  compositions  and  also  show  high 

chemical versatility. 

Bulk Mg-Si-(Al)-O-N glasses [12-15] are commonly prepared by melt quenching and exhibit 

superior  mechanical,  chemical,  thermal  and  optical  properties  compared  to  their  oxide 

counterpart glasses. However, as yet, the gains in properties are not worth to compensate for 

the  increased  efforts  required  to  synthesized  and  process  large  quantities  of  bulk  glasses. 

Furthermore, these glasses are difficult to synthesize with retained transparency in the visible 

region. The non-transparency of N rich bulk oxynitride glasses limits their use in the traditional 

optical  glass  applications,  even  though  their  hardness  and  elastic  modulus  are  significantly 

improved. Recently, we have prepared nitrogen-rich thin films in the Mg-Si-O-N [10] and Ca-

Si-O-N  [11]  systems,  which  are  transparent  in  the  visible  region.  They  are  also  free  from 

impurities such as elemental silicon particles and silicides, usually observed in nitrogen-rich 

bulk glasses. Metal-containing SiON thin films can be deposited on amorphous substrates as a 

protective coating. 

We have previously reported the synthesis and initial property characterization of thin films in 

the Mg-Si-O-N system prepared by reactive RF magnetron sputtering in Ar/N2/O2 gas mixture 

(at  N2 flow rate of 20%).   In the present work, we have prepared thin films in Mg-Si-O-N 

system at varied N2 flow rate, substrate temperature and Mg/Si target ratio, to investigate the 

effects of these parameters on properties. The mechanical properties, e.g. hardness and reduced 

elastic modulus and the optical properties in term of refractive index, extinction coefficients 

and band gap are investigated.

 2.   Experimental Procedure   

Mg-Si-O-N thin films were deposited on commercial soda-lime silicate float glass (air-side) as 

well as on reference silica wafers, and sapphire substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. The 

deposition system is described elsewhere [16, 17]. The thickness of the float glass substrate is 

4  mm,  while  silica  wafers  and  sapphire  substrates  have  thickness  of  1  mm  and  0.5  mm, 

respectively. For experiments, individual pieces of 10 mm × 10 mm were prepared. Reactive 

sputter deposition from silicon (purity 99.99 %), magnesium (purity 99.95 %) was performed 

in  an  ultra-high  vacuum  (UHV)  deposition  system  with  a  base  pressure  <1·10−5 Pa.  For  

reactive sputtering, a mixture of oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and argon (Ar) was used. The total 

gas flow was kept constant at 40 sccm, while the Ar and N2 flow rate was varied. The O2 flow 

rate  (0.6  sccm)  were  kept  constant  in  all  series.  Thin  films  in  the  Mg-Si-O-N  system  were 

prepared in four different sample series. The first series (M1) has Mg target power 80, 84 and 

96 W, and N2 flow of 20 % of the total gas flow [Ar+N2+O2].  The Si target of power 60 W 

was kept constant. The second series (M2) has Mg target power 60, 100 and 140 W and N2 

flow of 20 %. Some properties of the M2 series were previously reported [10], and are included 

in the present study for comparison. The third series (M3) has Mg target power 60, 100 and 

140 W and N2 flow of 30 %. All the samples in series M2 and M3 were prepared with constant 

Si target power of 100 W. M4 series were prepared with constant power of Si (50 W) and Mg 

(70 W) having substrate temperature of 100, 350 and 510 oC.  The Mg-Si-O-N thin films in all 

series were deposited during a time period of 2 hours. For reference purposes, thin films of SiN 

and  SiON  were  also  deposited  on  float  glass,  silicon  wafers  and  sapphire  substrates  using 

identical conditions as used for series M2. 

 X-ray diffraction (XRD) θ/2 θ scans were performed to determine the amorphous/crystalline 

nature  of  the  Mg-Si-O-N  thin  films  using  a  Panalytical  X’pert  PRO  MPD  diffractometer 

equipped with a Cu Kα source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. A light microscope (Olympus 

PMG3, Japan) equipped with a digital camera was used to observe the surface morphology of 

the  samples.  The  microstructures  of  the  samples  were  examined  by  back-scattered  electron 

images  using  a  JSM  7000F  scanning  electron  microscope.  The  SEM  was  operated  at 

acceleration voltages of 15 and 7 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out with a 

Nanoscope  111,  in  contact  mode.  The  AFM  images  were  processed  by  use  of  a  WSxM 

software.  Topographic images were taken, at different magnifications and several images were 

taken  over  different  sections  of  the  sample.  The  surface  composition  of  the  thin  films  was 

investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique on silica wafers substrate. 

4

 
XPS  analyses  were  performed  with  an  Axis  Ultra  DLD  instrument  from  Kratos  Analytical 

(UK).  The  base  pressure  in  the  system  during  spectra  acquisition  was  1.1 × 10−9 Torr 
(1.5 × 10−7 Pa).  Monochromatic  Al  Kα  radiation  (hν = 1486.6 eV)  was  used  and  the  anode 
power was set to 225 W. All spectra were collected from the area of 0.3 × 0.7 mm2 area at the 

center  of  the  sputter-cleaned  region.  The  elemental  concentrations  were  derived  using  a 

CasaXPS  software  employing  Shirley-type  background  [18]  and  manufacturer’s  sensitivity 

factors.  

The  durability  of  the  thin  films  was  investigated  by  keeping  some  samples  in  moisture 

atmosphere at 85 °C for three days and reexamining by ellipsometry technique one year later 

after the first examination. The X’Pert Reflectivity software was used to determine the density 

of  the  samples  by  using  a  fitting  model  calculation  on  the  experimental  data,  the  density, 

thickness, roughness, and refractive index (δ and β) of both film and substrate were used as 

fitting parameters.  

Hardness  (H)  and  reduced  elastic  modulus  (Eᵣ),  of  the  thin  films  were  measured  by 

nanoindentation using a Triboindenter Ti 950 instrument (Hysitron,  Inc.,  Eden Prairie, MN, 

USA) on float glass substrate.  A Berkovich diamond tip with total included angle of 142.3° 

and a half angle of 65.35° was used, with the indentation load of 1 mN, and penetration depth 

not exceeding 10% of the film thickness for films having thicker than 200 nm. The Berkovich 

diamond tip was calibrated on a fused-silica sample.  Each sample was measured twelve times 

to get a statistically valid average value. The indentation procedure consisted of three steps: 1) 

loading to P max during 5 s, 2) hold for 2 s, and 3) unloading during 5 s. The average hardness 

and reduced elastic modulus with standard deviation were calculated by the method of  Oliver 

and Pharr using the unloading elastic part of the load-displacement curve [19].  

Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) was used to evaluate the refractive index 

(nr), extinction coefficient (k), and band gap (E) of the Mg-Si-O-N thin films on float glass 

substrate. The measurements were done by using a Mueller matrix ellipsometer, the RC2®, 

from J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.  The measurements were done in the wavelength range of 210–

1690 nm and angles of incidence of 45°, 55°, 65° and 70° in reflection.  The ellipsometry data 

analysis  was  performed  with  the  software  CompleteEASE,  version  4.72,  also  from  J.A. 

Woollam Co., Inc. and fitted with a Tauc-Lorentz model [20] for amorphous films to assess 

their optical properties.

3.   Results and discussion 

3.1. Thin film stoichiometry and morphology.    

In  this  section  and  section  3.2,  series  M1,  M2  and  M3  are  presented  and  discussed.    The 

elemental concentration on the surface of the samples (determined by XPS) of Mg, Si, O, N in 

atomic percentage (at.%) are summarized in Table 1. Mg contents up to 28 at.% and N contents 

up to 40 at.%  were incorporated into the Mg-Si-O-N thin films. 

The Mg concentration increases with increasing Mg target power, as shown in Fig. 1.  A similar 

trend was also observed in the Mg-Si-O-N [10] thin films prepared with N2 flow of 20 %.  All 

the obtained films in the Mg-Si-O-N system have N content > 30 at.%, thus being classified as 

nitrogen  rich  films  based  on  the  definition  as    ≥  10  at.%  for  bulk  oxynitride  glasses.  No 

systematic relation between N and Mg concentrations is observed for Mg content higher than 

20 at.% in the films. This observation can be attributed to the formation of more Mg-O than 

Mg-N when  the  Mg  concentration  is  higher  in  the  films  and  agrees  with  those  of  previous 

studies of metal-containing bulk silicon oxynitride glasses that the N content initially increases 

with increasing the modifier content in the glass network [21-23]. Thin films in the M2 series 

have a higher N and lower Mg contents than the M1 and M3 series. The thin films in Mg-Si-

O-N system have higher content of N and Mg as compared to the bulk glass prepared by melt 

quenching or sol-gel techniques in the same system [12, 24]. The high nitrogen content in the 

Mg-Si-O-N thin films as compared to the Ca-Si-O-N thin films [11] prepared under similar 

conditions might be due to the high affinity of Mg towards nitrogen. A similar trend has been 

observed in bulk Mg/Ca-Si-O-N glasses [12]. 

Figure  2a  shows  that  the  Mg-Si-O-N  thin  films  are  homogeneous,  free  from  macroscopic 

impurities and are optically transparent in the visible region as compared with the bulk glass in 

the Mg-Si-O-N system Figure 2b.  Generally, bulk oxynitride glasses in the Mg-Si-(Al)-O-N 

system,  contains  macroscopic  impurities  in  the  form  of  metallic  silicide  and/or  free  silicon 

particles dispersed in the glass network, and are translucent in the visible spectrum [12].  

X-ray diffraction confirmed that all films deposited on float glass, silica wafers and sapphire 

substrates are X-ray amorphous. The surface structures of the films were investigated by using 

SEM, AFM and optical microscopy. The SEM cross-section morphology (Fig. 3a) and SEM 

back scattered electron image (Fig. 3b)   of  a 480 nm-thick film deposited with a Mg target 

power of 100 W presents a uniform and featureless structure without any visible defects, typical 

for amorphous films. Similar morphology was observed for all the studied films. The surface 

6

 
topography of all films, analyzed by AFM (Fig. 3c), is smooth and the surface roughness is 

lower than 15 nm. Again, this topography is typical for amorphous films.   

Generally, the chemical structure of the non-stoichiometric amorphous silicon oxynitride thin 

films can be described by  the random bonding model (RBM) [25]. A similar concept can be 

applied also to Mg-Si-O-N films. In this model, silicon atoms randomly bond with O and N 

atoms to form a homogenous O-Si-N network with possible SiO4, SiO3N, SiO2N2, SiON3 and 

SiN3 tetrahedral  coordinates.  The  presently  studied  thin  films  have  also high  amount  of  Mg 

content and it is likely that Mg taking on the role of a network former, in present of N. This 

assumption  is  based  on  the  model  for  bulk  oxynitride  glasses,  in  which  Mg  is  four-fold 

coordinated and likely participating in the silicon tetrahedral network due its high cation field 

strength [12, 26]. 

3.2 Film properties 

Film durability: 

Generally, corrosion by water is similar to acid corrosion in that alkali is removed from the glass 

surface and at high temperatures, water corrosion can become significant. After the treatment 

(keeping in moisture atmosphere at 85 °C for three day), the samples were observed by the naked 

eye  and  light  microscope  and  were  not  noticeably  affected  by  the  treatment.  Furthermore, 

reexamining by ellipsometry technique one year later after the first examination shows similar 

values as observed previously. This confirms that the Mg-Si-O-N thin films deposited onto float 

glass surface are chemically inert. 

Film thickness and roughness: 

The analyzed values of the Mg-Si-O-N thin films are reported in Table  II. The thicknesses and 

roughness of the deposited thin films on float glass substrates were determined by MMSE. The 

film thicknesses range from 156 nm to 545 nm. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the film 

thickness and the Mg content. It can be seen that the film thickness increases linearly with Mg 

content  for  all  three  series.  Series  M3  has  higher  values  of  thickness  as  compared  with  the 

series M1 and M2.  The Mg content increases linearly with the Mg target power, as expected. 

The roughness of the Mg-Si-O-N films varies between 2 nm to 16 nm and roughly increases 

with increasing, the Mg target power as can be seen in Fig. 5 as a function of Mg content. M1 

series have lower values of roughness as compared with the M2 and M3 series.

Film density and molar volume: 

 The density and molar  volume values are  given in Table  I. The densities of the films were 

found to have values varies between 2.99 g/cm3 and 3.09 g/cm3. Molar volume values were 

calculated accordingly to the equation given in Ref. [12]. The calculated molar volume values 

vary  between  6.54  and  6.72  cm3/mol.  Both  density  and  molar  volume  do  not  exhibit  any 

systematic dependency on the Mg and or N content.  

 Mechanical properties: 

The hardness and reduced elastic modulus values for the Mg-Si-O-N thin films are given in 

Table II. Hardness values vs the Mg content is plotted in Fig. 6. The hardness (H) values range 

from 15 GPa to 21 GPa and increases with increasing Mg content. The reduced elastic modulus 

as a function of Mg content is shown in Fig. 7. The reduced elastic modulus (Er) of the Mg-Si-

O-N films varies between 120 GPa and 176 GPa and shows similar dependence on composition 

as observed for the hardness.  The hardness and reduced elastic modulus values of the Mg-Si-

O-N thin films deposited on the float glass substrate show higher values than pure SiOx (, H= 

8.3 GPa and  Er =72 GPa). The same holds for SiOxNy (H=12.5–15.8 GPa and Er=126–160 

GPa), and, SiNy (H=17.1 GPa and Er = 166 GPa,) reported by Liu et al [27]. Furthermore, the 

Mg-Si-O-N thin films have higher values of hardness and reduced elastic modulus than SiN (H 

=10 GPa, Er = 91GPa) and SiON (H= 16 GPa and  Er = 120 GPa) thin films prepared during 

this study. Again, the Mg-Si-O-N thin films have higher values of hardness and elastic modulus 

than the bulk Mg-Si-O-N glasses. The increase of hardness and elastic modulus values with 

the  nitrogen  content  is  well  known  in  both  bulk  and  thin  films.  The  addition  of  nitrogen 

increases  cross-linking  in  the  glass  network  mainly  due  to  tri-coordinated  nitrogen  in  the 

tetrahedral units. Previous investigations in the bulk and thin film Mg-Si-O-N systems [12, 14, 

15, 28] show that the properties are also dependent on Mg content. For the present Mg-Si-O-N 

thin  films  both  hardness  and  reduced  elastic  modulus  display  large  dependence  on  the  Mg 

content. The M2 and M3 series have almost similar values of hardness for the similar power of 

Mg target but the M3 series has higher values of reduced elastic modulus as compared to the 

M2 series. The M1 series has lower values of hardness and reduced elastic modulus.  Generally, 

a high hardness of the amorphous material is accompanied by a high elastic modulus, with the 

exception of the sample ID# M-310 have comparatively low hardness value than the M-214 

and M-314 samples, but have high reduced elastic modulus (176 GPa) as compare to M-214 

(166 GPa) and M-314 (162 GPa).

Optical properties: 

The values of refractive index (nr) and extinction coefficients (k) for each sample and band gap 

(E) for M2 and M3 series are reported in Table II. The nr, k and E values were obtained from 

Tauc-Lorentz model fitted to the ellipsometry data collected for each sample. nr and k in the 

Mg-Si-O-N system as a function of wavelength are shown in Fig. 8a and 8b respectively. As it 

can  be  observed,  the  shape  of  the  spectra  is  similar  for  all  samples.  The  refractive  index  at 

wavelength 633 nm varies between 1.89 and 2.00 and becomes higher for higher values of the 

Mg content as shown in Fig. 9.   

The optical properties of the material not only depend on the chemical compositions but also 

correlated with surface and interface morphologies, defect structure and packing density. The 

refractive index increase with both Mg, predominantly, and N content for the present Mg-Si-

O-N  thin  films.  However,  an  attempt  to  ascertain  these  individual  effects  independently  is 

hindered by the simultaneous increase of Mg and N contents. Silicon oxynitride thin films have 

intermediate refractive indices of between 1.50 and 2.00 and depend on the composition ratio 

of O/N in the films.  As the Mg-Si-O-N thin films are nitrogen rich the nr values remain close 

to the pure Si3N4 (2.02) [29] . Thin films prepared in series M3 have slightly higher values of 

refractive index as compared to the series M1 and M2 prepared with similar Mg target power. 

This  might  be  due  to  the  high  amount  of  Mg  content  in  the  series  M3.    In  contrast  to  bulk 

oxynitride glasses, Mg-Si-O-N thin films have higher values of refractive index as compare to 

the  Ca-Si-O-N  thin  films  prepared  by  the  similar  deposition  technique  [11].  Previous 

investigation  on  bulk  AE-Si-O-N  glasses,  where  AE=  alkaline  earth  metals,  show  that  Mg 

containing glasses have lower values of refractive indices as compare to Ca, Sr and Ba [12]. 

Furthermore,  Mg-Si-O-N  thin  films  have  higher  nr values  compare  to  the  bulk  Mg-Si-O-N 

glasses.  

There are two possible reasons for this matter; first, the Mg-Si-O-N thin films contain about 

2.0  times  more  N  and  1.5  times  more  Mg  than  the  bulk  Mg-Si-O-N  glasses  prepared  by 

traditional quench melting. This means that thin films can grow with less Si and O contents as 

compared to amorphous bulk materials. Therefore, a denser structure is obtained with high N 

content,  due  to  the  presence  of  three  coordinated  N  as  compared  to  the  two  coordinated  O.  

Secondly, these thin films exhibit higher density values (2.98– 3.09 g/cm3) and lower molar 

volume (6.54 and 6.75 cm3/mol ) than the bulk Mg-Si-(Al)-O-N glasses having density values 

(2.55 – 2.86) [12, 15, 28] and molar volume values (7.03 – 7.23) [12].  In general, the nr is 

directly  related  to  the  materials  density  and  molecular  polarizability  and  increased  with 

increasing density and polarizability of the material. Therefore, the high nr values of the Mg-

9

 
Si-O-N  thin  films  are  due  to  the  changes  in  the  film  density  as  well  as  polarizability,  or  a 

combined effect thereof.  Furthermore, the density of these films is close to crystalline Si3N4 

(3.1-3.3  g/cm3)  as  compared  to  crystalline  SiO2  (2.2-2.6  g/cm3)  and  amorphous  SiO2  (2.2 

g/cm3).    Thin  films  show  high  refractive  indices  and  high  transparency  is  considered  to  be 

useful materials for optical applications. 

The extinction coefficients at the wavelength 233 nm vary between 0.011 and 0.186 and are 

predominately affected by the Mg content as shown in Fig. 10. The extinction coefficient (k) 

of all films at 233 nm is less than 0.20 and was  found to be strongly  dependent on the Mg 

content with the exception of the sample with ID: M-314 [Table II]. This indicates that the Mg-

Si-O-N  thin  films  exhibit  sufficiently  high  visible  light  transparency.  The  M3  series  have 

higher values of k than the M1 and M2 series. The k values were found to be zero in the visible 

region as can be seen in Fig. 8b. However, the k amplitude significantly increases to become 

higher near ultraviolet region (lower wavelengths), due to a progressive replacement of Si(ON) 

and  Mg(ON)  bonds  by  highly  absorbent  Si-Si  and  Mg-Si  bonds.  The  band  gap  value  as  a 

function of Mg content for series M2 and M3 is shown in Fig. 11. The band gap values vary 

between 3.436 and 4.490 and decrease with increasing Mg content.  

3.3 Influence of substrate temperature on properties. 

In order to determine the influence of the substrate temperature on the properties of the Mg-Si-

O-N thin films, samples were deposited on float glass substrate at temperatures of 100, 350 and 
510  oC (M4 series).  Identical synthesis parameters, i.e. Mg target power of 70 W, Si target 

power of 50, Ar flow of 31.4 sccm, N2 flow of 8 sccm, and O2 flow of 0.6 sccm were used for 

all these  depositions. The composition obtained by XPS is shown in table III and the properties 

are reported in table IV respectively. The films grown at different substrate temperatures were 

transparent, homogeneous and amorphous. Accordingly, to XPS data, the composition of the 

film depends on the substrate temperature. The content of Mg decrease and of N increases in 

the  films  that  are  prepared  at  increasing  substrate  temperatures.  The  thickness  of  the  films 

decreased  from  233  nm  to  169  nm  and  the  roughness  decrease  from  3.42  nm  to  1.06  with 

increasing the substrate temperate from 100 oC to 510 oC. The density of the Mg-Si-O-N thin 

films  varies  from  2.98  to  3.05  g/cm3  and  increases  with  increasing  substrate  temperature,  a 

similar trend was also reported by Patsalas et al [30] and Aarik et al [31] . The molar volume 

values vary from 6.80 to 6.65 cm3/mol and decrease with increasing substrate temperature. The 

data indicate that increasing the N content decreases the molar volume and increasing the Mg 

content increases it. The present results agree with those of previous studies of bulk glasses in 

10

 
 
the alkaline-earth-Si-O-N systems [12, 32-33].  The thin film deposited at substrate temperature 

of 100 oC have lower value of hardness and higher values of reduced elastic modulus than the 

films  deposited  at  350  and  510  oC.    The  hardness  and  elastic  modulus  values  of  thin  films 

deposited at 350 and 510 oC have almost similar values. The refractive index values are also 

affected by the substrate temperature and show a lower value of refractive index for the thin 

film  deposited  at  a  substrate  temperature  of  100  oC.    A  similar  trend  was  also  observed  for 

HfO2  thin  films  [31].  The  extinction  coefficient  values  decrease  with  increasing  substrate 

temperature.  These  variations  in  properties  are  particularly  important  when  considering 

temperature-sensitive  substrates  such  as  polymers.  The  thin  film  in  the  Mg-Si-O-N  system 

deposit at 100  oC substrate temperature has a higher hardness (10 GPa)  and reduced  elastic 

modulus (124 GPa) than uncoated float glass and polymer substrates and thus can be used as 

protective coating for polymer substrates.  

4.  Conclusions 

Amorphous Mg-Si-O-N thin films in a large range of composition were grown by reactive RF 

magnetron sputtering in an UHV deposition system. The Mg-Si-O-N thin films containing high 

amount of magnesium metal content up to 28 at.%. The composition of the thin film is mainly 

controlled  by  the  power  of  the  Mg  target  and  the  substrate  temperature.  The  hardness  and 

reduced elastic modulus were determined via nano-indentation technique and are found to be 

up to 21 GPa and 176 GPa respectively. The hardness and reduced elastic modulus values are 

higher than Si3N4 and SiON thin films and bulk Mg-Si-O-N glasses. These results indicate 

that Mg contributes to the high hardness and elastic moduli values of the Mg-Si-O-N thin films 

due to its high cationic field strength. The refractive index values range from 1.89 to 2.01 and 

are found to increase with the Mg (predominately) and N contents. The obtained thin films in 

the Mg-Si-O-N are transparent, having extinction coefficient values of zero at the visible region 

and  band  gap  values  ≥  3.2  eV.    The  Mg-Si-O-N  thin  films  of  series  M3  have  high  optical 

quality,  better  mechanical  and  chemical  properties  as  compared  with  series  M1  and  M2. 

Furthermore,  thin  films  deposit  at  100  oC  substrate  temperature  can  also  be  as  a  protective 

coating for polymer substrates due to its higher hardness (10 GPa) and reduced elastic modulus 

(124 GPa).
