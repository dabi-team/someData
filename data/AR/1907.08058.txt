Abstract 

Metal-halide perovskites are promising lasing materials for realization of monolithically integrated 

laser sources, the key components of silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Perovskites can 

be deposited from solution and require only low temperature processing leading to significant cost 

reduction and enabling new PIC architectures compared to state-of-the-art lasers realized through 

costly and inefficient hybrid integration of III-V semiconductors. Until now however, due to the 

chemical sensitivity of perovskites, no microfabrication process based on optical lithography and 

therefore on existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure has been established. Here, the 

first  methylammonium  lead  iodide  perovskite  micro-disc  lasers  monolithically  integrated  into 

silicon nitride PICs by such a top-down process is presented. The lasers show a record low lasing 

threshold of 4.7 µJcm-2 at room temperature for monolithically integrated lasers, which are CMOS 

compatible and can be integrated in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes.  

Main text  

Silicon photonics is recognized as a key photonic integration technology due to its compatibility 

with the CMOS manufacturing infrastructure and the potential for integration with back-end-of-

line Si microelectronics, and addresses applications ranging from telecommunications1 to gas 

sensing2 to lab-on-chip.3 The full potential of this photonic platform is however limited by 

challenges regarding the integration of laser sources, caused by incompatibilities of active III-V 

laser materials with silicon technology.4  

2 

 
 
 
The crystal lattice mismatch between Si and III-V semiconductors leads to defects during 

epitaxy, which act as nonradiative recombination centers and strongly reduce light emission.5,6 

Despite considerable progress in recent years, the integration of III-Vs by buffered5 or buffer-

less4 epitaxy cannot meet lattice defect requirements and further exceeds the thermal budget of 

CMOS electronics. Hence, available systems solutions are limited to III-V wafers bonded to Si 

waveguide wafers7 or transfer printed III-V chips.8 

Metal-halide perovskites in contrast, can be deposited on arbitrary substrates via low temperature 

(<120 °C), solution based processes, a decisive technological advantage. They are a class of 

ionic semiconductors with remarkable optoelectronic properties such as carrier diffusion lengths 

above 1 µm9 and a direct bandgap,10 and are investigated for aplications in photovoltaics (PV), 

photodetectors,11 LEDs12 and optically pumped lasers.13,14 Importantly perovskites also show a 

promise for electrically pumped lasing, as recently demonstrated with continuous wave (CW) 

lasing at near-infrared wavelengths below 160 K,15 CW enhanced amplified spontaneous 

emission (ASE) in green.16 and balanced ambipolar transport.17 

A major bottleneck in perovskite technology is their chemical reactivity, which leads to 

instability issues and currently prevents manufacturing by well-established semiconductor 

fabrication processes. In particular, industrial scale manufacturing of perovskite integrated 

devices would require high throughput, high resolution patterning with precise dimension and 

overlay control. This is only possible using optical lithography, which includes wet chemical 

processing in polar solvents and deionized water, which are generally harmful to such highly 

ionic crystals.18 Therefore, devices demonstrated so far have been fabricated with alternative 

techniques such as depositing perovskite on pre-patterned substrates,19 focused ion beam 

3 

 
milling,20 electron beam lithography using Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist compatible 

with perovskites,18 direct imprinting21 or templated crystal growth.22 

Here, we present micro disc methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite lasers 

manufactured with a conventional top down patterning process including optical lithography. 

The proposed fabrication scheme enabled the integration of the disc lasers into a silicon nitride 

photonic waveguide platform. In contrast to previous works on patterned perovskite devices, 

including our own earlier report, our new technology allows patterning of fully etched structures 

with high alignment precision and throughput, which is a major technological breakthrough for 

this technology. The lasing threshold of the fabricated lasers is 4.7 µJ/cm-2, which is lower than 

in unstructured materials.19,23 Considering that due to processing conditions disc lasers are prone 

to defects, the obtained results are promising with respect to prospective electrical pumping. 

Moreover, our fabrication procedure guarantees reproducible results with 83 tested devices 

fabricated on 4 different PICs exhibiting comparable lasing threshold and spectral characteristics 

of the lasing modes well controlled with the disc dimensions. In this context, the influence of the 

thin film polycrystallinity on the device performance was also studied using a model based on 

randomly generated crystal grains. This simulation approach advances modeling and design of 

optoelectronic devices based on perovskite thin films. 

Experiments were carried out using methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) as the most studied 

and technologically mature metal-halide perovskite material. Its optical gain is centered at ~785 

nm14. The design foresees a perovskite micro disc placed in the vicinity of a single mode silicon 

nitride (Si3N4) bus waveguide, cladded with a planarized SiO2 layer, as shown schematically in 

Figure 1a-b. The disc’s edge is aligned with the bus waveguide so that whispering gallery modes 

(WGM) can be coupled to it by the evanescent field and measured at the waveguide end at a 

4 

 
cleaved facet of the photonic chip. The bus waveguide can support both transverse electric (TE) 

and transverse magnetic (TM) fundamental modes. Resonant modes of the discs (Figure S 1, 

Supporting Information) were simulated using an analytical model24 and the MAPbI3 refractive 

index values obtained by ellipsometry (Figure S 2, Supporting Information), which are in a good 

agreement with literature values.25–27 Calculated free spectral ranges (FSR) between the resonant 

modes in the targeted wavelength range from 770 to 800 nm were approximately 5.3 nm, 3.3 nm 

and 2.3 nm for discs with radii of 4 µm, 6 µm and 8 µm, respectively. Precise positions of 

calculated TE and TM modes, FSR and effective refractive indices (neff) are listed in Tables S 2 

and S 3 (Supporting Information). The corresponding neff of the discs’ TE and TM modes were 

approximately 2.2 and 2.05, while neff of the single mode bus waveguide modes were only 1.67 

and 1.62 for TE and TM polarizations. The lower neff of the waveguide modes is caused by the 

lower refractive index of silicon nitride (2.0) with respect to refractive index of MAPbI3 of 

perovskite (2.56 at 780 nm wavelength, Figure S 2).  

The vertical directional coupler was optimized by finite difference time domain (FDTD) 

simulations via commercially available software (Lumerical FDTD solutions, details in the 

Supporting Information Figures S 3-5). The goal was to optimize the coupling gap and position 

of the bus waveguide with respect to the disc’s edge (called “offset”) such that the coupling 

efficiency was ~1%. The optimum was found for a bus waveguide offset of 150 nm towards the 

disc center and a separation from the perovskite by a 50 nm gap (Figure 1b). Such positioning 

precision was not technically achievable with the lithographic tool used in this work, but the disc 

positions were varied in 250 nm steps over a range of ± 1.25 µm so that there would be at least 

one nearly optimal structure after fabrication. Coupling efficiencies of both TM and TE WGMs 

to TM and TE waveguide modes were extracted by the mode expansion method built into the 

5 

 
simulation software. The optimized coupling efficiency was 0.57 % for TM and 0.12 % for TE 

modes. Waveguide modes of opposite polarizations were also excited, albeit weaker by a factor 

of 6 (TM) and 24 (TE) (referred to as the “cross polarization ratio”).

The perovskite disc lasers were fabricated using optical lithography with a double layer resist 

(details in the Experimental section), where the bottom layer shielded the perovskite from 

incompatible chemistry used for etch mask definition in the top photoactive layer (Figure 1c). 

Subsequently the pattern was transferred by a single step ICP RIE process (inductively coupled 

plasma reactive ion etching) with Cl2 and CF4 gases, which removed the resist interlayer and 

then the exposed MAPbI3 film. Scanning electron micrographs show that the polycrystalline 

structure of the initial material is well preserved after patterning (Figures 2a-b). The line edge 

roughness along the edge of the patterned perovskite can be attributed to the roughness 

introduced by the resist etch mask of the contact lithography process. The perovskite sidewall 

visible in Figure 2b shows a certain degree of underetching, which increases with Cl2 content in 

the etch plasma (not shown). The plasma composition was therefore carefully optimized to find a 

balance between low sidewall damage and the rate of formation of volatile PbClx compounds. 

The samples were further inspected with X-ray diffraction crystallography (XRD) to determine if 

MAPbI3 degrades during processing (Figure 2c). A small sign of MAPbI3 degradation was 

detected in the samples after the etching step, recognized by a shoulder in the (110) MAPbI3 peak 

in the XRD spectrum associated with PbI2. Photoresist stripping did not have an influence on the 

perovskite. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis revealed a trace of chlorine in the micro-

discs (Figure 2d, full EDX spectra in Figure S 6, Supporting Information).

MAPbI3 discs filtered with 15 nm broad filter at 760 nm. c) Map of photoluminescence of MAPbI3

The patterned MAPbI3 structures were electro-optically characterized through spatially resolved 

photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Figure 2e-f, Figure S 7 and S 8 of Supporting Information). 

The PL peak close to the edge of etched MAPbI3 was blue shifted by 6 nm and the PL intensity 

was twice as high as in the center of the disc. This can be explained by iodine exchange by 

gaseous chlorine from the etch plasma and formation of MAPbI3-xClx. Similar effects were 

reported previously in perovskite films by Solis-Ibarra28 and in single crystals by Zhang.29 We 

have further observed a slight crystal size reduction at the etched edges of the discs, which may 

also contribute to the blue shift and increase of PL emission.30  

Disc lasers with radii of 4.3 µm, 6 µm and 8.3 µm, located on separate PICs (among them two 

PICs containing discs with 6 µm radius), were optically pumped at room temperature in ambient 

conditions using 120 fs laser pulses at 250 kHz repetition rate centered at 630 nm wavelength 

(see details in Experimental section). Laser spectra were obtained by collecting light from Si3N4 

bus waveguides at the edge of the sample, 5 mm away from the disc, with a single mode 

polarization maintaining optical fiber featuring a collimator at the other end. The collimated 

beam entered a spectrometer after passing a polarizer, which was rotated in order to analyze the 

polarization of light generated in the MAPbI3 discs. Unless otherwise specified, the spectra 

presented in this work are of TM polarized light (electric field normal to the sample plane).  

A broad PL spectrum was observed from the MAPbI3 discs at low excitation fluence 

(Figure 3a, black line). The signal was extremely weak due to inefficient coupling of 

9 

 
 
omnidirectional spontaneous emission into the bus waveguide. When the excitation power was 

increased, a narrow resonance peak with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.1 nm 

appeared in the spectrum (Figure 3a, red line). When the emission peak intensity is plotted 

versus pump pulse fluence, clear thresholds (Pth) can be extracted (Figure 3b). The discs with 

radii of 4.3 µm, 6 µm and 8.3 µm show a Pth of 7.1 µJcm-2 4.7 µJcm-2 and 7.1 µJcm-2, 

respectively. The emission peaks saturate at 18 µJcm-2, 11 µJcm-2 and 19 µJcm-2. Below the 

lasing threshold we observe a PL signal with a FWHM of more than 20 nm. The spectrum 

narrows abruptly at a threshold of 4.7 µJcm-2, which is accompanied by a superlinear increase of 

the output intensity (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Both aspects are clear indicators of 

lasing.31 The quality factor (Q) of the lasing peak with FWHM of 1.1 nm is 709, which is low for 

a disc resonator of this size. This is due to the high roughness of perovskite causing significant 

scattering losses equal to 27.7 dB/cm (Estimated using measured Q factor value, Figure S10 of 

Supporting Information).

In general, the lasing threshold is reached once the modal gain equals propagation and curvature 

losses. Since the discs with the smallest radius did not have a higher threshold than the larger 

discs it can be assumed that the curvature loss was not dominant. Hence all lasers would be 

expected to have similar thresholds since the propagation losses and optical gain depend on 

morphology, processing and physical properties of the perovskite, which should also be similar. 

The thresholds of lasers with R = 6 µm (on two different chips) were lower than the thresholds of 

other lasers. This can be attributed to changing environmental conditions during the deposition 

process (e.g. varying solvent vapor content in the glovebox atmosphere) influencing the intrinsic 

materials properties and therefore the optical gain. We also observe a slightly red shifted spectral 

position of the gain curve compared to the other two samples (Figure 4a), which supports this 

assumption. 

At higher excitation of 1.15×Pth, additional modes appeared in the spectrum. These allowed 

investigating the correlation between the free spectral range and the disc radius to identify 

whispering gallery modes (Figure 4a). The free spectral range was found to be inversely 

proportional to the disc diameter, following the relation  

FSR = %&%’
()*

-., 

𝑛,

(1) 

where ng is the average group index of the modes between two resonant wavelengths λ1 and λ2 

and R is the disc radius (Figure 4b). The measured FSRs are higher than the calculated values. 

This difference can be attributed to the chlorine intake into MAPbI3 along the etched edge of the 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structure, where the whispering gallery modes are propagating: the Cl increases the bandgap and 

results in both lowering of the refractive index32 and a strong change of the material dispersion at 

wavelengths considered in the calculations. (Table S 2 and Table S 3, Supporting Information). 

As FSR is very sensitive to the dispersion (included in Eqn. 1 inside ng term) the difference 

between measured and calculated values reached up to 52 %.

The laser output was expected to contain two groups of WGMs: TE and TM polarized 

characterized by different neff and hence having different sets of resonant wavelengths. Spectra 

recorded while changing the polarizer angle differed only in intensity of the modes but not in 

their position in the spectrum (Figure 4c). The measured TM polarized signal was ~3 times 

stronger than the TE signal, while PL signal below threshold was not polarized (Figure S 11, 

Supporting Information). FDTD simulations serve to explain this behavior, when roughness of 

the MAPbI3 was included as a parameter (Figure 5a). It was implemented by generating random 

crystal grains of similar size as those observed with SEM in the actual films (Figure 2a-b). The 

simulated electric field amplitude in the bus waveguide plane was compared for the simple and 

the polycrystalline case (Figure 5b-c). Despite strong scattering caused by crystal grains, light 

still couples well to the bus waveguide. This scattering further enables TM and TE WGMs to 

excite waveguide modes of the opposite polarizations that are 2 and 4.7 times weaker, 

respectively (Figure S 12, Supporting Information ). This unwanted polarization cross-talk is 

higher than simulated with the simple model (cross-polarization ratios of 2 vs 6.3 and 4.7 vs 23), 

therefore it can be attributed to the crystal grains. The simulated electric field amplitude profile 

in the perovskite disc plane (Figure 5d-e) revealed that the crystallites introduce significant 

optical losses of the WGMs and lead to the excitation of higher order modes. Nonetheless, 

14 

 
 
WGMs polarization was not altered, indicating that the polarization cross-talk takes place in the 

directional coupler and not in the disc itself. The roundtrip transmission in a 4.3 µm disc 

resonator obtained by FDTD simulation with the model incorporating the perovskite’s 

morphology is equal to 0.56, which stands in a good agreement with the round trip transmission 

of 0.44 extracted from the measurement using the Q factor of 650 measured in a disc of the same 

size. This confirms the large impact of perovskite roughness on the laser’s performance, and that 

the model correctly resembles the material’s morphology.

The spectra of the lasers evolved upon increasing the pump fluence, as illustrated in Figure 6a. 

Just above the lasing threshold, there was one clearly dominating mode in the center of the laser 

spectrum at 785.02 nm. At higher excitation, the mode at 789.51 nm became dominant with a 

weaker mode appearing at 792.04 nm, at the edge of the optical gain. We attribute this to band 

gap renormalization, which results in red shifting of the optical gain33 and can be observed 

experimentally in the red-shifting of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra 

(Figure 6b). One possible explanation of band gap narrowing is heating. However, heating has 

been shown to widen the band gap in MAPbI3.

34,35 Since the laser operates in high excitation 

regime at a high electron-hole plasma density, we propose that the band gap narrowing is a result 

of many-body effects as reported in other direct bandgap semiconductors.36

The FWHM of the single lasing peak just above the threshold was 1.1 nm and gradually 

increased to 4 nm at the excitation of ~10 µJcm-2 (Figure 6c, dashed line), at which point the 

laser started to saturate and its modes started to overlap (Figure 6a, grey line). In a CW laser the 

FWHM is expected to narrow with increasing pump power due to gain saturation by the lasing 

mode37. In the case of the perovskite disc laser pumped by short pulses, gain does not saturate 

since the output is multimode. This leads to amplification of spontaneous emission noise which 

couples to the cavity modes and broadens the laser lines38. At very high excitation this ASE 

noise is so strong that it leads to overlapping of the WGMs (Figure 6a, gray line), in line with the 

observed increase of FWHM, and observed also in18. Furthermore, this parasitic ASE is 

depleting the available gain and causing the stimulated emission intensity to saturate at an 

excitation of approximately 11 µJcm-2, which coincides with ASE threshold of 10.6 µJcm-2 

(Figure S13 of the Supporting Information).The spectral positions of the WGMs shifted towards 

blue with increasing excitation39 (Figure 6c, solid lines) followed by an increase in FSR (e.g. 

from 5.08 nm at 8.22 µJcm-2 to 6.5 nm at 14.1 µJcm-2 between modes 2 and 3 ). We attribute this 

to the change of the dielectric function of the MAPbI3, which modifies the optical length of the 

circumference of the disc resonators. Above the lasing threshold, in the high excitation regime, 

the absorption decreases as the material is depleted of carriers, which can absorb photons by 

excitation from the valence to the conduction band. The refractive index is coupled to the 

absorption through the Kramers-Kronig relation: the strong reduction of absorption at energies 

close to the bandgap where the laser is operating induces a significant reduction of the real part 

of the refractive index,40 causing blue shifting of the resonant modes. In summary, the spectral 

characteristics of the micro disc emissions include spectral narrowing, polarization and verified 

WGMs, which - in conjunction with a clear threshold - confirms lasing in our devices.

The overall reproducibility achieved with the technology presented in this work is an outcome of 

many optimized processing steps, such as fabrication of the photonic chips, perovskite deposition 

and perovskite patterning. A comparison of discs with R = 6 µm located on two different 

samples confirms the reproducibility of the MAPbI3 patterning (Figure 6d). The largest source 

of variability was the polycrystalline morphology of MAPbI3. The crystal size distribution 

ranged from 50 nm to 200 nm (Figure 2 a-b), which translates into fluctuations of the refractive 

index within disc resonators and non-uniformities of the discs thicknesses. This resulted in 

variations of the group index of WGMs, which became manifest in a standard deviation of FSR 

reaching 1.3 nm within a single sample. The differences in MAPbI3 morphology between 

different samples led even to different spectral positions of gain,41 as observed in Figure 4a.  

We demonstrated a scalable, high throughput technology for patterning of metal-halide 

perovskites with industry standard processes. The methodology was applied to lead halide 

perovskites that were patterned into MAPbI3 disc lasers. These lasers were integrated into a 

silicon nitride waveguide platform, where they were characterized to benchmark the technology. 

We achieved a lasing threshold of 4.7 µJcm-2 and a linewidth of 1.1 nm, which is one of the 

lowest reported values for polycrystalline perovskites lower than in devices made of unprocessed 

perovskites19,23 and is the record value for monolithicaly integrated CMOS compatible lasers.42 

High device-to-device and sample-to-sample reproducibility evidences that this technology has 

potential for industrial scale fabrication. We further introduce an optical simulation method 

which takes into account the polycrystalline nature of solution processed perovskite thin films 

and thus supports understanding the behavior of experimental devices. The tool can be further 

exploited to design perovskite electro-optic components based on polycrystalline thin films.

This work provides a large step towards exploiting the main advantages of organo-metal 

perovskites over III-V semiconductors, e.g. low cost deposition from solution and 

straightforward bandgap engineering, to provide cost efficient lasers at infra-red and visible 

wavelengths.43 The disk lasers investigated here demonstrate an important technological 

advancement, i.e. the feasibility of process integration of perovskite materials with high 

throughput patterning techniques. This work thus removes a major obstacle on the path towards 

exploitation of these materials in commercial integrated optoelectronic circuits and points 

towards developing techniques for wafer scale deposition of high quality perovskite films. 

Furthermore, our technology can be used as a base for development of electrically pumped 

lasers. This will include not only the development of efficient carrier injection into the perovskite 

but also , following the footsteps of the perovskite solar cell community44, detailed studies of 

stability and degradation mechanisms of perovskites as laser gain media. Considering 

requirements for reliability of commercially available laser diodes with wear out times of up to 

106 hours45, preventing degradation by implementation of hermetic packaging46 preventing 

moisture associated deterioration47 and by barriers stopping corrosion of metal electrodes by e.g. 

iodine ions48 is of great importance for perovskite lasers. Our lasers, protected only by a 1 µm 

thick PMMA coating, were intensively tested in ambient conditions for multiple hours and stored 

in a nitrogen filled box in between the experiments. These were carried out daily for three weeks 

without significant performance deterioration or a single device failing. This is a promising result 

indicating that reaching reliability required in commercial applications should be possible in the 

future.  

Experimental section 

Fabrication of PICs: Devices were fabricated on 6” silicon wafers with 2.2 µm of thermally 

grown SiO2. 250 nm of silicon nitride was deposited by a low pressure chemical vapor 

20 

 
deposition (LPCVD) process from dichlorosilane and ammonia gases. The Si3N4 waveguides 

were defined by AZ-MiR 701 photoresist and reactive ion etched with an inductively coupled 

plasma (ICP) using CFH3 and helium gases. This was followed by a LPCVD deposition of 600 

nm of SiO2 (low temperature oxide - LTO) by silane and oxygen reaction. Planarization of the 

SiO2 surface was done by spin coating of spin-on glass (SOG) and subsequent etching in CHF3 

plasma. This process cycle of SOG coating and dry etching was repeated twice, resulting in 

approximately 50 nm height difference between the LTO surface above and next to the silicon 

nitride waveguides with a smooth transition. Hence, about 300 nm of LTO was consumed during 

these planarization steps leaving 50 nm of LTO above silicon nitride waveguides. Next, wafers 

were coated with protective polymer and diced into 3×3 cm samples.  

Perovskite deposition: The photonic chips were cleaned from the protective polymer layer 

through sonication in acetone and isopropanol, followed by 10 minutes of oxygen plasma 

cleaning in a RF plasma reactor. The chips were then brought into a nitrogen filled glovebox for 

the subsequent perovskite deposition. The perovskite solution was prepared with 1M of 

methylammonium (CH3NH3I, Dyesol), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9985 %, Alfa-Aesar) and dimethyl 

sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9 %). These were dissolved in 1ml of dimethylformamide 

(DMF, anhydrous, 99.8 %) and heated to 60 °C for 1 hour while stirring. The resulting solution 

was filtered (0.22 um polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter) and spin-coated on the cleaned 

silicon substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s. 300 µl of chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8 %) was 

dripped after 6 s from the spin start. The resulting film was exposed to a two-step annealing 

process (45 °C, 5 min + 100 °C, 10 min) to complete the conversion of the precursors into 

perovskite. 

Patterning of MAPbI3:  First, a 200 nm resist layer was deposited via spin coating. AZ MiR 701 

positive tone photoresist was then spin coated at 3000 rpm and annealed at 95 °C for 90 s. Next, 

the micro disc lasers were defined through a mask by UV light using a contact lithography mask 

aligner (EVG 420). Afterwards the photoresist was baked at 115 °C for 90 s and developed for 

20 s in MF26 CD developer. The pattern was transferred into the PMMA/MAPbI3 stack in a 

single reactive ion etch step with Cl2 and CF4 gases. The chlorine forms volatile PbClx 

compounds49 while CF4 is used to bind and neutralize excess chlorine to prevent under etching. 

The photoresist was removed by dipping the samples in a non-polar solvent at 40 °C for 20 

21 

 
minutes. Immediately after removing samples from chlorobenzene, 1 µm of PMMA was spin 

coated and annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes.  

Photoluminescence mapping: Photoluminescence mapping was performed using a WiTec 

Confocal Raman microscope. The sample was scanned with a 532 nm CW laser at 100 nW 

power. The laser spot was 300 nm in diameter and the scanning step size was 400 nm. The 

measurement was taken at room temperature in ambient conditions. 

XRD, EDX and SEM inspection: XRD spectra were taken on complete devices before and after 

the etching process using a Bruker D8 Advance (Bragg-Brentano geometry). The EDX 

measurements were performed in an SEM Zeiss SUPRA 60 with a Bruker XFlash 4030 detector. 

The primary energy was 15 keV, the takeoff angle was 35° and the working distance was 12 mm. 

SEM micrographs were taken using the same microscope at 4 kV and a working distance of 3.5 

mm.  

Laser characterization: The disc lasers were pumped with 120 fs pulses at 630 nm wavelength 

and repetition rate of 250 kHz delivered by a commercial optical parametric amplifier (OPA, 

Coherent 9450). The OPA was provided with 50 fs pulses at 800 nm wavelength generated by a 

mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator (Coherent Micra) in conjunction with a regenerative amplifier 

(Coherent RegA 900).The pump laser beam was focused with a 150 mm lens before the sample. 

The samples were positioned on a sample chuck mounted on a XY micrometer stage and held by 

vacuum. To guarantee safe alignment of the optical fiber end to the sample edge, a CCD camera 

with 8× zoom lens with a working distance of 82 mm was used. We calculated the Gaussian spot 

size of the elliptically shaped laser spot to be 9860 µm2, using an image of photoluminescence 

from the excited perovskite. The output was collected by edge coupling to a polarization 

maintaining fiber (Thorlabs PM780-HP, mode field diameter 4.9 µm) and collimated by Toptica 

Fiberout_01227. The collimated beam passed through a metal wire grid polarizer and was 

recorded by Maya2000 Pro (Ocean optics) spectrometer with 0.4 nm resolution.  

All samples were measured in air at room temperature.
