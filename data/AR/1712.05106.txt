ABSTRACT

We investigated how the magnetic ﬁeld in solar active regions (ARs) controls ﬂare activity, i.e., whether a conﬁned or
eruptive ﬂare occurs. We analyzed 44 ﬂares of GOES class M5.0 and larger that occurred during 2011–2015. We used
3D potential magnetic ﬁeld models to study their location (using the ﬂare distance from the ﬂux-weighted AR center
dFC) and the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the corona above (via decay index n and ﬂux ratio). We also present
a ﬁrst systematic study of the orientation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, using the orientation ϕ of the ﬂare-relevant
polarity inversion line as a measure. We analyzed all quantities with respect to the size of the underlying dipole
ﬁeld, characterized by the distance between the opposite-polarity centers, dPC. Flares originating from underneath
the AR dipole (dFC/dPC < 0.5) tend to be eruptive if launched from compact ARs (dPC ≤ 60 Mm) and conﬁned if
launched from extended ARs. Flares ejected from the periphery of ARs (dFC/dPC > 0.5) are predominantly eruptive.
In conﬁned events the ﬂare-relevant ﬁeld adjusts its orientation quickly to that of the underlying dipole with height
(∆ϕ (cid:38) 40◦ until the apex of the dipole ﬁeld), in contrast to eruptive events where it changes more slowly with height.
The critical height for torus instability, hcrit = h(n = 1.5), discriminates best between conﬁned (hcrit (cid:38) 40 Mm) and
eruptive ﬂares (hcrit (cid:46) 40 Mm). It discriminates better than ∆ϕ, implying that the decay of the conﬁning ﬁeld plays
a stronger role than its orientation at diﬀerent heights.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares often occur in combination with coro-
nal mass ejections (CMEs).
It is believed, that both
phenomena are closely related and diﬀerent manifesta-
tions of the same underlying physical processes (Priest
& Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara 2011). Flares as-
sociated with a CME are usually referred to as erup-
tive events, while ﬂares that lack associated ejections of
coronal plasma are called conﬁned or ”CME-less” events
(Svestka 1986). However, we lack a deeper understand-
ing of the physical mechanisms behind ﬂares and CMEs,
which knowingly condition our Space Weather on Earth
(e.g. Gosling et al. 1991) To date, we suﬀer from moder-
ate abilities to predict (i) when a solar ﬂare will happen
and (ii) whether or not it will develop an associated
CME.

Wang & Zhang (2007) analyzed 8 large ﬂares (≥
GOES class X1.0) and found that conﬁned/eruptive
ﬂares tend to occur closer to/farther from the ﬂux-
weighted center of their host AR. They also analyzed
the horizontal magnetic ﬂux that penetrates a vertical
plane, aligned with the ﬂare-relevant photospheric po-
larity inversion line (PIL). They deﬁned a lower (1.0–1.1
R(cid:12)) and an upper (1.1–1.5 R(cid:12)) height regime within
this plane, and the corresponding ﬂuxes as Flow and
Fhigh. They evaluated the “ﬂux ratio” as Flow/Fhigh,
to quantify the relative strength of the horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld strength as a function of height in the solar
corona. They found lower/higher ﬂux ratios for con-
ﬁned/eruptive ﬂares, indicating that a less strongly de-
caying magnetic ﬁeld with height may have hindered the
ejection of an associated CME.

Alternative measures to quantify the decay of the
horizontal ﬁeld as a function of coronal height have
been used, e.g., in the form of the decay index, n =
−d ln Bhor/d ln h, with Bhor denoting the constrain-
ing (external) magnetic ﬁeld and h the height in the
It is based on the torus instability model by
corona.
Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006) which predicts that a ﬂux rope
becomes unstable if the central axis reaches a height
(hcrit) at which n reaches a critical value (ncrit).
In
other words, a system becomes unstable when the over-
lying horizontal ﬁeld strength decayes suﬃciently fast.
Based on magneto-hydrodynamic simulations involving
diﬀerent geometrical assumptions on the current channel
mimicking the ﬂux rope (e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2007; Fan
& Gibson 2007; D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010; Zuccarello
et al. 2015) and prominence observations (e.g., Zuc-
carello et al. 2016), ncrit is found in the range (cid:39)1.0–2.0.
Despite this extended range of critical values ncrit = 1.5
is often used in observation-based studies that aim at as-
sessing the likelihood of a CME to occur. As a common

practice, the constraining magnetic ﬁeld above the po-
tentially unstable ﬂux rope is approximated by the hor-
izontal component of an associated potential (current-
free) magnetic ﬁeld model.

Recently, Wang et al. (2017) presented a statistical
analysis of 60 ﬂares. They found that in ARs that
host eruptive ﬂares, hcrit
is reached at signiﬁcantly
lower coronal heights. They also found that n increases
monotonously with height in 86% (84%) of the erup-
tive/conﬁned events studied, whereas the rest of the ana-
lyzed events exhibited a saddle-like proﬁle (see also, e.g.,
Cheng et al. 2011). They found the saddle-like proﬁles
to be characteristic for an underlying “multipolar” pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬂux concentration, i.e., when the line
connecting the opposite-polarity centroids of the ﬂaring
AR did not pass through the ﬂare-relevant PIL or was
oriented almost parallel to it. Careful examination of the
saddle-like n(h) proﬁles also revealed signiﬁcantly lower
values of n at the saddle bottoms in conﬁned events.

In this paper we also investigate the large-scale mag-
netic ﬁeld structure in ﬂaring ARs, in context with the
occurrence of eruptive or conﬁned events. We study 44
large (≥M5.0) ﬂare events that occurred during the SDO
era, between January 2011 and December 2015. In con-
trast to earlier works, we seek to pin down the magnetic
ﬁeld related parameter that discriminates best between
conﬁned and eruptive events. Therefore, we assess the
performance of diﬀerent known measures that charac-
terize the decay of the conﬁning ﬁeld above ﬂaring ARs
(decay index and ﬂux ratio).

Going beyond, we also analyze the change of orienta-
tion of the ﬂare-related magnetic ﬁeld as a function of
height in the corona. Ideally, if the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld of an AR is approximated by an East-West
aligned symmetric potential (current-free) dipole ﬁeld,
the corresponding PIL would run in North-South direc-
tion, both at low as well as large heights.
In reality,
however, the orientation of PILs at low heights are often
found to deviate strongly from such an idealized north-
southward direction, but to transit towards the North-
South direction with increasing coronal height (see, e.g.,
Fig. 2 of Jing et al. 2015). This motivates us to present
here a ﬁrst systematic study of the orientation of the
ﬂare-relevant PIL as a function of height in the corona,
for a large number of ﬂares.

In section 2 we describe our event sample as well as
the data and methods used. The details of the analysis
are described in 3, the obtained results presented in 4
and discussed in 5.

2. DATA AND MODELING

2.1. Event sample

On the factors determining solar flares

We searched the GOES ﬂare catalog1

for ﬂare
events exceeding a peak soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux of
5 × 10−4 W m−2 (i.e., ﬂares of GOES class M5.0 and
larger), that occurred between January 2011 and De-
cember 2015. From this set of events, we selected those
that took place within 50 degrees from the solar disk
center to avoid projection eﬀects.

To classify events as conﬁned or eruptive, we con-
sulted the LASCO CME catalog2 (Gopalswamy et al.
2009) and additionally the CACTus3 (Robbrecht &
Berghmans 2004) and CORIMP CME lists4. We re-
garded a ﬂare and a CME to be associated, if the back-
extrapolated height-time proﬁle of the CME (as deduced
from LASCO-C2 images) agreed with the ﬂare onset
time of the GOES ﬂare catalog.
In addition, the po-
sition angle of the CME had to agree with the quad-
rant on the Sun in which the ﬂare occurred. Further-
more, a ﬂare was classiﬁed as to be eruptive if a coronal
EUV wave was observed5, since these large-scale dis-
turbances are known to be generated by magnetic re-
conﬁguration in the framework of an expanding CME
(for a review see, e.g., Warmuth 2015). Only one event
(SOL20120510T04:18M5.7) occurred during a short pe-
riod of non-coverage in the LASCO CME catalog. In or-
der to be able to classify the ﬂare as conﬁned or eruptive,
we visually inspected STEREO-B COR1 observations,
in which the ﬂare was observed above the north-west
limb. The absence of a ﬂare-associated CME, together
with the missing of a ﬂare-associated EUV wave6, al-
lowed us to classify this event as to be conﬁned.

In total, we were able to unambiguously deduce the
ﬂare type for 44 events which fulﬁll the selection cri-
teria above (see Table 1). Out of these, 12 (∼27%)
events were conﬁned (7 M- and 5 X-ﬂares) and 32
(∼73%) were eruptive (18 M- and 14 X-ﬂares).
In
comparison to Toriumi et al. (2017), we classify two
events diﬀerently. Firstly, we classify event no. 20
(SOL20110213T17:38M6.6) as to be eruptive because we
observe an associated CME in LASCO C2. In addition,
a coronal EUV wave has been observed, as analyzed by
Luoni et al. (2017). Secondly, we classify event no. 33
(SOL20131101T19:53M6.3) as to be conﬁned, for the
opposite reasons.

The 32 eruptive ﬂares in our event sample originated
from 18 diﬀerent ARs, and the 12 conﬁned events orig-
inated from 7 diﬀerent ARs. That implies that some of

the considered events originated from a single AR within
several consecutive days. For instance, ﬁve large con-
ﬁned ﬂares originated from NOAA 12192 in the course
of four days. Similarly, e.g., NOAA 11283 (11429) pro-
duced four large eruptive ﬂares during three (four) con-
secutive days. As a consequence, some of the ARs
are over-represented (especially in our set of conﬁned
events), we believe that the continuous time evolution
of the individual ARs over several days allows us to
study the corona above as representative for the con-
ditions yielding conﬁned or eruptive ﬂaring. We nev-
ertheless discuss the possible implications of the over-
representation of NOAA 12192 in the sample of conﬁned
events when presenting our results.

2.2. Data and methods

The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in and above the ﬂare
ARs was investigated based on full-disk vector magnetic
ﬁeld observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012). We used hmi.B 720s
data (Hoeksema et al. 2014) which provides the total
ﬁeld, inclination and azimuth on the entire solar disk.
After disambiguation of the provided azimuth7, we ap-
plied a de-projection (following Gary & Hagyard 1990)
to the image-plane transverse and line-of-sight (LOS)
magnetic ﬁeld (Bx
t ,BLOS) in order to obtain the lo-
cal horizontal and vertical magnetic ﬁeld components
(Bx
h,Bz). The native (full-resolution) plate scale of
the magnetic ﬁeld data is (cid:39) 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)504 per pixel. For mag-
netic ﬁeld modeling, we binned the data to a plate scale
of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)01 per pixel, with the binning of the data being
nearly magnetic ﬂux preserving.

For an extended area, covering the ﬂare AR as well
as its near quiet-Sun surrounding, we modeled the po-
tential magnetic ﬁeld in the corona above, based on the
Fourier transformation method outlined in Alissandrakis
(1981). Here, we used Bz of the last available magnetic
ﬁeld data prior to the ﬂare onset as input. We modeled
the magnetic ﬁeld vertically with the same resolution as
in horizontal direction (1.(cid:48)(cid:48)008 per pixel), up to a height
of 1.26 R(cid:12) above a photospheric level (using nz = 256
levels in our numerical setup).

We used high-resolution full-disk imagery from the
SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012), with a spatial resolution of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. 1600 ˚A images
were used to study the structure of the ﬂare-associated
ribbons. In order to identify the ﬂare-relevant PILs, we
inspected ﬁltergram sequences during the ﬂares at UV
and EUV wavelengths, in combination with the HMI

and ﬂare location

To assess the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld structure of
the studied ARs, we ﬁrst determined the ﬂux-weighted
centers of positive and negative magnetic polarity. Here,
we considered all pixels that hosted a magnetic ﬁeld
strength ≥ 10% of the peak value of the respective po-
larity (triangles in Fig. 1b). We calculated the distance
between the polarity centers (dPC, black line connect-
ing the triangles in Fig. 1b). Then, we deﬁned the ﬂux-
weighted AR center as the position lying halfway on this
connecting line.

To assess the relative position of the ﬂare site within
the host AR, we calculated the “ﬂare distance” (dFC;
yellow line in Fig. 1b). dFC was deﬁned as the distance
between the ﬂare site and the ﬂux-weighted AR center.
In order to determine the ﬂare site we proceeded as fol-
lows. We used ﬂare ribbons observed around the ﬂare
peak time in AIA 1600 ˚A images (red ﬁlled contours
in Fig. 1a and 1c), in combination with the Bz = 0
G contour in the pre-ﬂare HMI map (yellow curve in
Fig. 1a and 1c), to localize the ﬂare-relevant part along
the extended PIL within the AR (orange/yellow curve in
Fig. 1a/c). For further analysis, we use a linear approx-
imation of this ﬂare-relevant segment of the PIL (blue
line connecting blue crosses on top of the yellow curve in
Fig. 1c). The ﬂare site was then deﬁned as the halfway
point along this straight line (position where the yellow
and blue lines intersect in Fig. 1b).

In order to estimate error bounds for dPC and dFC,
we repeated the above described procedure using the
thresholds 5% and 15% for the computation of the indi-
vidual ﬂux-weighted polarity centers.

3.2. Orientation of the ﬂare-relevant PIL
as a function of height

In order to study the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the corona, we traced the ﬂare-relevant PIL as a
function of height in our potential magnetic ﬁeld mod-
els. Therefore, we ﬁrst tracked the ﬂare-relevant PIL
at a photospheric level, i.e., at a grid height z = 0 in
our 3D model volume (yellow line in Fig. 1a). The

corresponding PIL at subsequently larger grid heights
(z = 1, . . . , nz) was detected using an automated algo-
rithm. At each grid height z > 0, we searched for the
relevant PIL within an area that horizontally extended
±2 Mm around the PIL that was tracked previously at
the next lower grid level (at z − 1). For example, to ﬁnd
the ﬂare-relevant PIL at model grid height z = 2, we
analyzed Bz at z = 2 within a ±2 Mm window around
the horizontal coordinates of the PIL tracked at z = 1.
Hereafter, we manually deﬁned a sub-ﬁeld (black out-
line in Fig. 1a), suﬃciently large to cover the ﬂare-
relevant part of the automatically tracked PIL at each
height in the model volume (see Fig. 1e and 1f for its
shape at diﬀerent heights). Then, we applied a linear ﬁt
(straight line in Fig. 1a) to the ﬂare-relevant PIL at each
height level (orange contour in Fig. 1a). This allowed
us to estimate the inclination, ϕ, of the PIL with re-
spect to the North-South direction (vertical dashed line
in Fig. 1a) at each height in our model volume (Fig. 1d).
Note that we measured ϕ positively in counter-clockwise
direction from solar North.

Our goal was to quantify how fast the ﬂare-involved
magnetic ﬁeld transits to a conﬁguration aligned with
the underlying photospheric magnetic dipole. Naturally,
our event sample contains ARs of diﬀerent size (i.e., of
varying dPC). Therefore, we chose to analyze the change
of ϕ as a function of physical height, h, normalized to
the size of the underlying magnetic dipole (see top x−
axis in Fig. 1d). A value h/dPC = 0.5 then refers to the
top part of the ﬁeld spanned by the underlying mag-
netic dipole, i.e., to its apex (vertical dashed line in
Fig. 1d). In that way, we are able to compare the de-
duced parameters for diﬀerently sized ARs with each
other in an objective way. In order to deduce the rota-
tion of the ﬂare-relevant PIL over a vertical length scale
characteristic for the underlying dipole, we computed
∆ϕ = |ϕ(0) − ϕ(h/dPC = 0.5)|. Here, ϕ(0) denotes the
orientation of the ﬂare-relevant PIL at a photospheric
level and ϕ(h/dPC = 0.5) is the orientation at the apex
of the assumed symmetric dipole ﬁeld.

Two main groups are separable in our event sample.
One group (62% of the analyzed events) is comprised
of cases for which the ﬂare-relevant PIL was traceable
until large heights in the magnetic ﬁeld models (for in-
stance event no. 15; see Fig. 1d–1f). For these cases,
∆ϕ is listed in the last column of Table 1. For the re-
maining cases in our event sample, the ﬂare-relevant PIL
could not be traced until a height corresponding to the
apex of the underlying dipole ﬁeld. In other words, the
ﬂare-relevant PIL “disappeared” already at low heights.
Most of these events were found associated to under-
lying photospheric magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations involv-

ing parasitic polarities and isolated small-scale magnetic
ﬁeld structures within the ARs. As a result, ∆ϕ could
not be evaluated for these ARs which is denoted by ’–’
in the last column of Table 1.

3.3. Decay index and ﬂux ratio

In order to characterize the constraining magnetic
ﬁeld in the corona above the ﬂare-relevant PIL, we an-
alyzed the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld in more detail. We
used the linear approximation to the otherwise irregu-
larly shaped ﬂare-relevant PIL (see Sect. 3.1 for details)
as an input and assumed this line to represent the foot-
print of a vertical plane within our magnetic ﬁeld mod-
els. After interpolation of the magnetic ﬁeld into this
plane, we were able to study its strength as a function
of height. The black stars in Fig. 1g give the mean value
of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld, (cid:104)Bhor(cid:105), as a function of
height, taking into account all of the values along the
horizontal length of the plane. The error bars mark the
corresponding standard deviation.

Based on the horizontal ﬁeld, we calculated the decay
index, n, in the vertical plane (Fig. 1h) and derived the
mean decay index, (cid:104)n(cid:105), along the horizontal length of the
plane as a function of height h (blue diamonds in Fig. 1g;
the error bars indicate the 1σ standard deviation). The
(cid:104)n(cid:105) vs. h proﬁles allowed us to determine the critical
height for torus instability hcrit = h((cid:104)n(cid:105)crit = 1.5). The
corresponding uncertainties are given by the heights at
which h((cid:104)n(cid:105)crit ± 1σ) reaches a value of 1.5.

We note here that the (cid:104)n(cid:105) vs. h proﬁles in our event
sample are almost equally distributed between mono-
tonically increasing (54%) and saddle-like (46%) pro-
ﬁles. This is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the ﬁndings of
Wang et al. (2017), who reported these fractions as 85%
and 15%, respectively, based on an event sample largely
comprised of smaller ﬂares (75% of their analyzed events
were <M5.0).

We also calculated the horizontal magnetic ﬂux
through the vertical plane in the two height regimes
1.0 R(cid:12) ≤ h ≤ 1.1 R(cid:12) (Flow) and 1.1 R(cid:12) ≤ h ≤ 1.26 R(cid:12)
(Fhigh), and computed the ﬂux ratio as Flow/Fhigh.
The ﬂux ratio has been introduced in Wang & Zhang
(2007), with the diﬀerence that they estimated Fhigh
in the height regime 1.1 R(cid:12) ≤ h ≤ 1.50 R(cid:12). We as-
sessed the eﬀect of this diﬀerence on the resulting ﬂux
ratio, in that we employed our potential ﬁeld models
until h = 1.5 R(cid:12) for a number of events and repeated
the ﬂux ratio computation. We found diﬀerences in the
obtained values of ≈10% at most. The value of the ﬂux
ratio also depends on the particular orientation of the
vertical plane used to carry out the analysis, i.e., on
the direction of the resulting linear ﬁt to the underly-

ing ﬂare-relevant PIL. By comparison of the results for
slightly diﬀerent inclined PILs (all of them resembling
the orientation of the underlying ﬂare-relevant PIL to
a good degree), the associated uncertainty of the ﬂux
ratio is assumed to be ∼10%.

4. RESULTS

In Fig. 2a, the ﬂare distance (dFC) is shown in re-
spect to the size of the AR (dPC). Notably, eruptive
ﬂares appear to occur in ARs of all sizes, from com-
pact (dPC (cid:46) 60 Mm) to extended ARs (dPC up to
(cid:38) 100 Mm). Conﬁned ﬂares, on the other hand, are
found to predominantly originate from extended under-
lying bipolar ﬁeld conﬁgurations (dPC (cid:38) 60 Mm).

Eruptive ﬂares are found at a large range of dis-
tances (5 (cid:46) dFC (cid:46) 80 Mm).
In contrast, con-
ﬁned ﬂares originate mainly from close to the ﬂux-
weighted magnetic center of the host AR (dFC (cid:46)
25 Mm). This is not the case in only two conﬁned
events: SOL20110730T02:09M9.3 (event no. 21) and
SOL20120510T04:18M5.7 (event no. 29), which can be
explained based on the fact that the ﬂares originated
from a “spot-satellite” region (cf. Fig. 6 of Toriumi et al.
2017). That means that they originated from a minor
(“satellite”) bipolar magnetic ﬂux concentration located
in the periphery of an AR. This naturally results in a
larger value of dFC,
if measured with respect to the
ﬂux-weighted center of the main AR.

For the eruptive events we ﬁnd a clear dependency be-
tween dPC and dFC, with a correlation of cc (cid:39) 0.6 ± 0.1,
independent of the magnitude of the ﬂares (compare size
of plot symbols, where smaller/larger symbols denote
M-/X-ﬂares). The trend of the ﬂare distance to increase
with the size of the host AR might not be a real trend,
however, since a larger dFC can be expected for a more
extended host AR (with a larger dPC).

We ﬁtted a linear regression to the values found for
eruptive events in the form y = a + b · x, where we pro-
ceeded in the following way. We randomized the x− and
y− values around the respective values of dPC and dFC
within their uncertainty ranges and ﬁtted the result us-
ing the IDL function LADFIT. Based on n = 10.000
realizations of this scheme, we determined the mean oﬀ-
set a = (cid:104)[a1, . . . , an](cid:105) and mean slope b = (cid:104)[b1, . . . , bn](cid:105),
together with their corresponding uncertainties. For the
eruptive events we ﬁnd a = 0.5 ± 0.1 and b = 4 ± 6. The
same approach as outlined here was used to describe
the dependencies of the analyzed parameters through-
out this section.

In order to account for the extent of the underlying
magnetic dipole ﬁeld, we show the normalized ﬂare dis-
tance dFC/dPC in Fig. 2b, which also allows us to com-

neath the magnetic ﬁeld connecting the opposite mag-
netic polarity centers of the AR. In case of magnetically
compact ARs, this may imply a strong inﬂuence of the
overlying dipole ﬁeld. This complies with the fact that
we ﬁnd all but one conﬁned ﬂare at normalized ﬂare
distances dFC/dPC ≤ 0.5 in Fig. 2b.

In contrast, a value dFC/dPC > 0.5 refers to a loca-
tion in the periphery of the AR, where the overlying
magnetic ﬁeld should be weaker. And indeed, a large
number of eruptive ﬂares are found at such normalized
ﬂare distances (red crosses above horizontal dashed line
in Fig. 2b). Note also that a fraction of the eruptive
events originates from close to the magnetic center of
their host AR (red crosses below horizontal dashed line
in Fig. 2b). This is mostly the case for compact ARs
(dPC ≤ 60 Mm), however. This is in contrast to con-
ﬁned ﬂares, which tend to predominantly occur close to
the ﬂux-weighted magnetic AR center (dFC/dPC ≤ 0.5)
of extended ARs (dPC (cid:38) 60 Mm).

Only the conﬁned events no. 29 and 44 do not follow
this trends (dPC (cid:38) 60 Mm but dFC/dPC (cid:38) 0.5), as well
as event no. 21 (dPC (cid:46) 60 Mm and dFC/dPC < 0.5). As
explained above, the spacial organization of the host AR
in form of a spot-satellite region explains the deviation
from the general tendency.

Fig. 3 shows the orientation of the ﬂare-relevant PIL
as function of the normalized height (h/dPC) in our
magnetic ﬁeld models, i.e., with respect to the verti-
cal height of the underlying dipole ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that
in conﬁned ﬂares, the ﬂare-relevant PIL at photospheric
levels is inclined by |ϕ| (cid:38) 50◦ (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the
ﬂare-relevant PIL in AR’s hosting eruptive ﬂares, ap-
pear at a large range of possible inclinations (Fig. 3a).
Notably, for conﬁned events, we ﬁnd the PIL to align
with the solar North-South direction (indicated by the
gray-shaded area in Fig. 3a and 3b) rather quickly with
height, mostly within a height of h/dPC (cid:39) 0.5, which
corresponds to the apex of the surrounding magnetic
dipole ﬁeld. This is not the case for AR’s hosting erup-
tive ﬂares, where the ﬂare-relevant PIL may still span
a large angle with respect the North-South direction
(ϕ (cid:38) 10◦ at h/dPC = 0.5 in Fig. 3a). In other words, the
PIL orientation changes much faster with height above
ARs that host conﬁned ﬂares than above those that host
eruptive ﬂares.

In Fig. 3c and 3d we plot the change of the orientation
of the ﬂare-relevant PIL with respect to the photospheric
level, ∆ϕ = |ϕ(h) − ϕ(0)|, i.e., with respect to the orien-
tation of the underlying dipole ﬁeld. For conﬁned events,
we ﬁnd most prominent changes (∆ϕ (cid:39) 40◦–60◦) of the
PIL orientation to occur over a height characteristic of
the underlying dipole ﬁeld (h/dPC (cid:46) 0.5; Fig. 3d). This

is not the case for eruptive ﬂares, where the changes
range from a few degrees up to about 60◦ (Fig. 3c).
Moreover, the orientation of the ﬂare-relevant PIL may
still undergo strong changes above the apex of the un-
derlying dipole ﬁeld (above h/dPC = 0.5). In Fig. 4c,
we show the distribution of ∆ϕ, separately for conﬁned
and eruptive ﬂares (blue and red histograms, respec-
tively). We ﬁnd the distributions of the two groups
of events as distinct, with the conﬁned events join-
ing the distribution of eruptive events at large values
(∆ϕ (cid:38) 40). In particular, we ﬁnd ∆ϕ (cid:46) 40◦ for most
of the ARs that host eruptive events and ∆ϕ (cid:38) 40◦ for
those that host conﬁned events (compare also Fig. 3c

and 3d). We ﬁnd mean values of (cid:104)∆ϕ(cid:105) = 26.1 ± 16.4◦
and (cid:104)∆ϕ(cid:105) = 53.1 ± 8.2◦, respectively.

Note that ﬁve conﬁned ﬂares in our event sample
(events no. 13–16 and 37) originated from a single AR
(NOAA 12192) over four days, and thus exhibit very
similar values of the deduced parameters. In order to
compensate for this over-representation in our conﬁned
events statistics, we computed the mean values of ∆ϕ
from the individual values of the ﬁve events and show the
corresponding occurrences as ﬁlled histograms in Fig. 4c
(and in a similar way for hcrit and the ﬂux ratio in Fig. 4a
and b, respectively). When considering this “reduced”
set of values, we obtain (cid:104)∆ϕ(cid:105) = 55.5 ± 5.5◦.

The
ﬁlled histograms show the relative distribution for conﬁned
ﬂares if the individual respective values of the ﬁve ﬂares that
originated from NOAA 12192 are replaced by the respective
mean values.

In Fig. 4a we show the distribution for hcrit which
well separates between AR’s that host conﬁned (hcrit (cid:38)
40 Mm) and eruptive (hcrit (cid:46) 40 Mm) events, with
only a small overlap of the populations. We ﬁnd mean
values of (cid:104)hcrit(cid:105) = 52.7 ± 16.7 Mm and (cid:104)hcrit(cid:105) =
20.9 ± 9.5 Mm for ARs that hosted conﬁned and erup-
tive events, respectively. Compensation for the over-
represented NOAA 12192 gives (cid:104)hcrit(cid:105) = 47.4±16.0 Mm.
The corresponding histogram of the ﬂux ratio (Fig. 4b)
shows conﬁned and eruptive events as two distinct but
overlapping populations, with the conﬁned events re-
siding at the lower range of values (ﬂux ratio (cid:46) 25)
Only a few conﬁned events, no. 21 (ﬂux ratio (cid:39) 58), 29
(ﬂux ratio (cid:39) 49), and 44 (ﬂux ratio (cid:39) 67) show larger
values. Again, these are the conﬁned ﬂare events that
originated from spot-satellite ARs.

In order to test whether or not the distributions
of hcrit, ﬂux ratio and ∆ϕ for conﬁned and eruptive
events can be modeled to originate from a single, nor-
mally distributed population of events, we performed
an Anderson-Darling 2-sample test (using the package

kSamples in R). The p-values obtained for the three con-
sidered quantities are found not to exceed 0.01. In other
words, we may reject the corresponding null-hypothesis
with 95% conﬁdence and consider the results obtained
for conﬁned and eruptive events as to be distinctly dif-
ferent.

Last, we check for possible relationships between the
diﬀerent deduced quantities. We ﬁnd a clear correspon-
dence between hcrit and the ﬂux ratio (cc (cid:39) −0.7 ± 0.1;
see Fig. 5a). Since the data points well align with the
linear ﬁt (black line) we may safely assume that both
parameters are robust indicators of the decay of the hor-
izontal magnetic ﬁeld overlying a ﬂaring AR. However,
hcrit appears to be a much better discriminator between
AR’s that host conﬁned or eruptive ﬂares. Also hcrit
and ∆ϕ are correlated (cc (cid:39) 0.6 ± 0.1; see Fig. 5b).
In that case, however, the correlation appears to result
mainly from the apparent clustering of the parameters
deduced for conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares in the distinct
parts of the scatter plot. While conﬁned events are con-
centrated in the upper right quadrant (hcrit (cid:38) 40 Mm,
∆ϕ (cid:38) 40◦), the parameters for the majority of eruptive
cases is found in the lower left quadrant.

After compensation for NOAA 12192 being over-
represented, we ﬁnd cc(hcrit, ﬂux ratio) (cid:39) −0.4 ± 0.1
and cc(hcrit, ∆ϕ) (cid:39) 0.2 ± 0.1.

5. DISCUSSION

We aimed at a better understanding of the magnetic
ﬁeld structure in and above ﬂaring ARs in terms of the
type of ﬂare activity—conﬁned or eruptive. We ana-
lyzed 44 large ﬂares (GOES class M5.0 and larger) that
occurred between January 2011 and December 2015,
which were observed close to the solar disk center, and
for which the ﬂare type could be unambiguously deter-
mined.

Our goal was to deepen our insights regarding the
discriminating factors in the ﬂare-associated magnetic
ﬁeld, both at photospheric and coronal levels. For this
purpose, we constructed a 3D potential ﬁeld magnetic
ﬁeld model for each ﬂare AR, based on a pre-ﬂare pho-
tospheric SDO/HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld map.
Im-
portantly, we put all considerations in context with
the characteristic length scale of the bipolar magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration of the host AR, which we approxi-
mated by a symmetric dipole with a typical length scale
equal to dPC/2, both in horizontal and vertical direc-
tion (height). Here, dPC denotes the distance between
the ﬂux-weighted centers of opposite magnetic polarities
within the AR.

At photospheric levels, we investigated the distance
of the ﬂare site to the ﬂux-weighted AR polarity center

(dFC), as well as the size of the host AR (given by dPC).
At coronal levels, we analyzed quantities characterizing
the relative strength of the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld (de-

cay index n and ﬂux ratio) and the change of orientation
of the ﬂare-relevant PIL as a function of height (∆ϕ).
To our knowledge, ∆ϕ, has not been investigated so far
systematically for a large number of ﬂare events.

Perhaps our most important ﬁnding is a distinctly dif-
ferent spatial organization of the magnetic ﬁeld above
ARs that host conﬁned or eruptive ﬂares. In ARs that
host conﬁned ﬂares, the orientation of the ﬂare-relevant
PIL changes much faster with height towards a direction
representative for the underlying dipole magnetic ﬁeld.
The orientation of the PIL changes quickly from an ini-
tial high inclination at photospheric levels to a direction
representing the underlying dipole ﬁeld, within a typi-
cal length scale of the underlying bipolar magnetic ﬁeld
(∆ϕ (cid:38) 40◦ until a height h (cid:39) dPC/2; Fig. 3d). This is
not the case for ARs that host eruptive ﬂares. There,
the transition towards the characteristic orientation of
the underlying dipole ﬁeld involves much larger heights
(Fig. 3c). ∆ϕ discriminates to a certain degree between
AR’s that host conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares, showing two
populations in the corresponding histogram that overlap
at large values (40◦ (cid:46) ∆ϕ; cf. Fig. 4c). This indicates
that the relative orientation of the coronal ﬁeld at dif-
ferent heights above a ﬂare site may play a role in deter-
mining whether a conﬁned or eruptive ﬂare will occur.
Equally important is the ﬁnding that the ﬂare type
can be easily understood in terms of the ﬂare site in
respect to the size of the dipole magnetic ﬁeld of the
host AR. We found that conﬁned ﬂares mainly origi-
nate from extended ARs (dPC (cid:38) 60 Mm), while erup-
tive ﬂares originate from ARs of very diﬀerent sizes
(40 (cid:46) dPC (cid:46) 140 Mm; see Fig. 2). Also, conﬁned
ﬂares primarily originate from locations close to the ﬂux-
weighted AR center (dFC (cid:46) 25 Mm), while eruptive
ﬂares may originate from basically everywhere within
an AR (5 (cid:46) dFC (cid:46) 80 Mm). In order to address the im-
portance of the location of the ﬂare with respect to the
underlying bipolar magnetic ﬁeld, we considered nor-
malized ﬂare distances (dFC/dPC). This allowed us ﬁrst,
to place the ﬂare site with respect to the possibly weak
or strong conﬁnement of the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld
and second, to make the measured distances and exten-
sions of the considered ARs comparable to each other.
The use of normalized distances places the conﬁned
events clearly inside of the underlying magnetic dipole
ﬁeld (dFC/dPC < 0.5; Fig. 2b). Since the overlying mag-
netic ﬁeld in extended ARs (dPC (cid:38) 60 Mm) decays
slowly with height, a correspondingly strong conﬁne-
ment exits that likely prohibits the escape of an possibly
associated CME. In contrast, a large number of eruptive
ﬂares originates from the periphery of ARs (dFC/dPC >
0.5) where the overlying ﬁeld is weaker. Notably, erup-

exclusively large events, i.e., ﬂares of GOES class M5.0
and larger.

Another important ﬁnding in our study is that hcrit
discriminates better between AR’s that host conﬁned
and eruptive ﬂares than the ﬂux ratio, an alternative
quantity to measure the decay of the horizontal ﬁeld
(Fig. 5a), which has been introduced by Wang & Zhang
(2007).
Importantly, hcrit shows two distinct popula-
tions, and clearly separates between conﬁned (hcrit (cid:38)
40 Mm) and eruptive ﬂares (hcrit (cid:46) 40 Mm; Fig. 4a).
The ﬂux ratio on the other hand shows a less clear dis-
tinction (compare Fig. 4b). We suspect the reason in the
higher sensitivity of hcrit towards the non-linear decay
of the horizontal ﬁeld with height in the corona.

In order to substantiate whether or not the stud-
ied parameters deduced from ARs hosting conﬁned and
eruptive events can be used as discriminating factors at
all (i.e., whether they stem from a single normally or
non-normally distributed population of events), we per-
formed an Anderson-Darling 2-sample test for hcrit, ﬂux
ratio, and ∆ϕ. This allows us to state with 95% conﬁ-
dence that the studied parameters do not ﬁt a normal
distribution, i.e., can be considered as to be distinctly
diﬀerent for conﬁned and eruptive events.

Wang & Zhang (2007) furthermore reported a clear
segregation of conﬁned and eruptive events in a ﬂux ra-
tio vs. dFC diagram (cf. their Fig. 5). More precisely,
they found the conﬁned/eruptive events to reside at
lower/higher values of both, dFC and ﬂux ratio. We
do recover this trend only to a certain degree, and with
a large overlap of the two populations (see Fig. 7). A
reason for the diﬀering results may again be the partic-
ular event selection, on which the diﬀerent studies are
based on. While Wang & Zhang (2007) analyzed only
8 ﬂares, we considered a much larger number of events
( 44 in total). Also, while Wang & Zhang (2007) stud-
ied only major (X-class) ﬂares, we included large ﬂares
(M5.0-class and larger). Importantly, the overlap in our
diagram is not solely caused by the eruptive M-ﬂares in-
cluded in our study, i.e., we also ﬁnd eruptive X-ﬂares
at low values of both, dPC and ﬂux ratio. Consequently,
the diﬀerent ﬁnding cannot be simply attributed to the
larger range of ﬂare sizes included in our study.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We analyzed

44 ﬂares (GOES class ≥M5.0) that
occurred between January 2011 and December 2015.
Based on SDO/HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld maps, we
modeled the 3D potential magnetic ﬁeld above the ﬂare
ARs. We studied the vertical decay and orientation of
the ﬂare-relevant 3D magnetic ﬁeld, in relation to the

tive ﬂares that originate from within the strong conﬁne-
ment of the underlying AR dipole ﬁeld (dFC/dPC < 0.5)
mostly do so in compact ARs (dPC (cid:46) 60 Mm). Here,
we may argue that in compact ARs, the conﬁning mag-
netic ﬁeld decays rapidly with height, i.e., the critical
height for torus instability hcrit, resides at lower coronal
heights, allowing for ﬂare-associated CMEs.

Correspondingly, we ﬁnd clearly lower values of hcrit
in ARs that host eruptive ﬂares ((cid:104)hcrit(cid:105) (cid:39) 21 ± 10 Mm)
than for those which host conﬁned ﬂares ((cid:104)hcrit(cid:105) (cid:39)
53±17 Mm), in accordance to earlier studies (e.g. Cheng
et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2017). Wang et al. (2017) sug-
gested an empirical relation of the form hcrit (cid:39) 0.5 · dPC
(cf. their Fig. 2 and see gray dotted line in Fig. 6).
Based on our event sample and analysis, we ﬁnd hcrit (cid:39)
0.4 ± 0.1 · dPC (black solid line in Fig. 6), which agrees
with the trend found in Wang et al. (2017) within our
uncertainty range. As a reason for the slightly diﬀerent
result, we suspect the diﬀerent ﬂare sizes covered in our
study. Wang et al. (2017) analyzed 60 ﬂares down to
GOES class M1.0, where the majority of events (75%)
In our study we considered
were classiﬁed as <M5.0.

2. The critical height for torus instability, hcrit =
h(ncrit = 1.5), is the most robust measure to discrimi-
nate between ARs that host conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares.
AR’s exhibiting values of hcrit (cid:46) 40 Mm above the ﬂare-
relevant PIL are likely to produce an eruptive ﬂare. It
segregates conﬁned from eruptive ﬂares better than al-
ternative measures for the vertical decay of the magnetic
ﬁeld (the ﬂux ratio), most likely due to its higher sensi-
tivity to the nonlinear decay of the conﬁning magnetic
ﬁeld above ARs.

3. The orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld is organized
distinctly diﬀerent in the corona above ARs that host
conﬁned or eruptive ﬂares.
In ARs that host con-
ﬁned ﬂares, the orientation of the ﬂare-relevant PIL,
∆ϕ, quickly adjusts to the underlying photospheric AR
dipole ﬁeld with height. The adjustment (∆ϕ (cid:38) 40◦)
is completed already at the apex of the conﬁning dipole
ﬁeld, i.e., at a height h (cid:39) dPC/2. That is diﬀerent for
ARs that host eruptive ﬂares, where the ﬂare-relevant
PIL might be still considerably inclined near the apex
of the underlying magnetic dipole ﬁeld.

4. Though there exists a moderate degree of correla-
tion between ∆ϕ and hcrit, it appears that the critical
height for torus instability is a stronger measure for the
type of the upcoming ﬂaring. This implies that the ver-
tical decay of the conﬁning ﬁeld plays a stronger role
than the particular orientation of the ﬁeld at diﬀerent
heights.

5. The parameters deduced for ARs that host conﬁned
and eruptive events (hcrit, ﬂux ratio, ∆ϕ) cannot be
modeled to originate from a single normally distributed
population of events, i.e., can be considered as to be
distinctly related to the particular ﬂare type.

associated ﬂare type, conﬁned or eruptive. Our most
important ﬁndings include:

1. The ﬂare type may be well understood in terms
of the ﬂare site within an AR, measured by the ﬂare
distance from the ﬂux-weighted AR center, dFC. This
is especially true if dFC is interpreted with respect to
the characteristic length scale of the underlying photo-
spheric magnetic dipole (approximated by the half dis-
tance between the centers of opposite magnetic polar-
ity, dPC/2).
If located underneath the conﬁning ﬁeld
spanned by the magnetic dipole (i.e., at a distance
dFC/dPC ≤ 0.5), ﬂares tend to be eruptive when hosted
by a compact (dPC (cid:46) 60 Mm) AR and conﬁned when
launched from an extended AR (dPC (cid:38) 60 Mm). Flares
that originate from the periphery of the conﬁning bipo-
lar ﬁeld (dFC/dPC > 0.5) tend to be eruptive, no matter
if the AR is compact or not.
