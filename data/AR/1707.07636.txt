We use orthogonally polarized two-colour (OTC) laser pulses to separate quantum paths in mul-
tiphoton ionization of Ar atoms. Our OTC pulses consist of 400 nm and 800 nm light at a relative
intensity ratio of 10:1. We ﬁnd a hitherto unobserved interference in the photoelectron momentum
distribution, which exhibits a strong dependence on the relative phase of the OTC pulse. Analysis
of model calculations reveal that the interference is caused by quantum pathways from non-adjacent
quarter cycles.

Key processes in nature such as the breakage and for-
mation of molecular bonds are ultimately determined by
the dynamics of the molecular valence electrons. Ob-
taining access to the dynamics of the valence electrons in
atoms and molecules thus constitutes a crucial capability
for understanding and manipulating molecular processes.
An ideal tool to interrogate and drive the rearrangement
of the valence electron cloud in such systems on its intrin-
sic time-scale of attoseconds is the strong electric ﬁeld of
intense laser pulses. The momentum distributions of pho-
toelectrons emitted during the interaction of such ﬁelds
with atoms and molecules contain a wealth of information
about the structure and ﬁeld-induced attosecond dynam-
ics in the target.

Here, we use tailored laser ﬁelds, so-called orthogo-
nally polarized two-color (OTC) ﬁelds [1–3], that allow
determining the direction of the emission of photoelec-
tron wavepackets on laser sub-cycle time-scales. This al-
lows us to gain control over the creation of interference
structures in photoelectron momentum distributions and
at the same time permits to experimentally disentangle
a novel class of interference fringes from the many other
structures in the measured distributions. These struc-
tures are, on the one hand, due to the spatial properties
of the ionizing system, e.g., the symmetry of the ion-
izing orbital, that modulate the emitted photoelectron
wavepacket directly during the ionization step and are
imprinted in the ﬁnal photoelectron momentum distribu-
tions [4, 5]. On the other hand, the observed photoelec-
tron momentum distributions are also determined by the
ﬁeld-driven dynamics of the emitted wavepackets during
which their amplitude and phase structure is modiﬁed,
thus, determining their interference at the detector.

The observed photoelectron momentum distribution
therefore constitutes a complicated interference pattern
of all emitted wavepackets and contains information
about the dynamics of the bound states from which they

are coherently split by ionization, their ﬁeld-driven dy-
namics, and their interaction with the parent ion’s com-
bined nuclear and electronic charge distribution. The
dynamical and structural information contained in the
photoelectron momentum distributions can often be ex-
tracted by analysing them in terms of semiclassical elec-
tron trajectories [6]. Within this framework, the mea-
sured distributions can be understood as interferences of
electron wavepackets that reach the detector on direct
or recolliding trajectories, the latter scattered either in
the forward or backward direction, giving rise to inter-
cycle and intra-cycle fringes [7, 8], holographic structures
[9, 10] and diﬀraction patterns [11–13], respectively.

While the diﬀraction patterns generated by the recol-
liding trajectories can be exploited for obtaining struc-
tural information about the molecule with few femtosec-
it has been shown that mea-
ond resolution [14–17],
sured interference fringes due to the direct trajectories
can be inverted to yield the dynamics of valence elec-
tron wavepackets with few attosecond resolution [7]. Two
types of direct trajectories need to be distinguished for
such inversion: those launched with a periodicity of ex-
actly one laser cycle giving rise to inter-cycle fringes also
referred to as above-threshold ionization (ATI) peaks
[18, 19], and trajectories that originate from a single laser
cycle, leading to intra-cycle interference fringes [7, 8].
The resulting modulation of the inter-cycle peaks by the
intra-cycle fringes can be interpreted as the diﬀraction
of the emitted wavepackets on a temporal grating [8].
Thus far only intra-cycle fringes that originate from elec-
tron wavepackets emitted during adjacent quarter-cycles
of the optical wave — a situation that has been called
the temporal double slit — have been considered theoret-
ically [8, 20, 21] and observed in experiments [7, 22, 23].
In our experiment OTC ﬁelds are used for the gener-
ation of a customized temporal grating for wavepacket
emission, which allows us to create and observe for

the ﬁrst time intra-cycle interferences from non-adjacent
quarter-cycles. The key to this achievement is the gener-
ation of an OTC ﬁeld that consists of a weak orthogonal
component with half the frequency of the ionizing ﬁeld.
By varying the phase-delay between the two colours this
enables us to control the momentum overlap of photo-
electron wavepackets originating from adjacent and non-
adjacent quarter-cycles. Depending on the phase-delay,
the two-dimensional character of the OTC ﬁelds maps
the sub-cycle wavepacket emission times into diﬀerent
regions of the momentum space, which solves the no-
torious problem of disentangling the diﬀerent types of
interference structures from measured photoelectron mo-
mentum distributions and allows the clear observation of
the intra-cycle fringes from non-adjacent quarter-cycles.
Disentanglement of diﬀerent quantum paths using the
two-dimensional mapping provided by OTC ﬁelds has
been considered previously [24–27]. Previously employed
OTC pulses were generated by temporally overlapping
an intense 800 nm pulse with a weaker, perpendicularly
polarized, 400 nm pulse. In contrast, we invert the in-
tensity ratio between long and short wave length and use
an intensity ratio of approximately 10:1 for 400 nm and
800 nm, respectively. Whereas multiphoton ionization
in OTC pulses with a half-frequency streaking ﬁeld has
been investigated previously theoretically [28], our work
explores this concept in experiment and theory to ﬁnd
a previously unidentiﬁed sub-cycle interference structure
in the photoelectron momentum distribution.

In the experiment, OTC pulses were generated by com-
bining s-polarized, 45 fs, 800 nm laser pulses, with p-
in a collinear geom-
polarized, 45 fs, 400 nm pulses,
etry at a repetition rate of 5 kHz. The peak inten-
sity in the isolated 800 nm and 400 nm pulses was es-
timated (uncertainty about 20%) as 0.2 × 1014W/cm2
and 2 × 1014W/cm2, respectively. We used COLTRIMS
[29] to record the three-dimensional (3D) photoelectron
momentum distribution of single ionization of argon. As
usual, we deﬁne the ﬁeld of the OTC pulse as [24]

E(t) = ˆE [fx(t) cos(ωt)ex + fz(t) cos(2ωt + ϕ)ez]

(1)

with ˆE the peak ﬁeld strength, ω the laser frequency
of the 800 nm ﬁeld, fx,z the pulse envelopes along the
800 nm and 400 nm direction, respectively, and ϕ the
relative phase between the two colors. Fig. 1 illustrates
how the orthogonally superposed 800 nm streaks the sub-
cycle ionization in the 400 nm ﬁeld. According to the
simple man’s model (SMM) [30, 31] the ﬁnal electron
momentum after the laser pulse is given by p = −A(ti),
with A(t) = − (cid:82) t
−∞ E(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) the laser ﬁeld’s vector po-
tential and ti the birth time of the electron. Fig. 1(a)
depicts A(t) for each wavelength separately and for the
two important limiting cases ϕ = 1.5π and π. Fig. 1(b)
shows the corresponding measured photoelectron mo-
mentum distributions in the polarization plane of the

are due to the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld in the spectrome-
ter and therefore are an experimental artifact. On top of
the photoelectron momentum distributions we superim-
posed p = −A(ti) for ti covering half of an optical cycle
of the 800 nm ﬁeld using the color code of Fig. 1(a).

In order to facilitate the analysis of the complex mo-
mentum distributions it is useful to transform the data
into a polar coordinate system in the plane of polarization
with the photoelectron energy Ekin as the radial coordi-
nate. In Fig. 2(a) we have done this transformation for
the data of Fig. 1(b). A polar angle of θ = 0◦ corresponds
to a momentum towards the right side, i.e., pz,400nm > 0
and px,800nm = 0 a.u. Apart from the sharp line-features
due to the experimental artifacts mentioned above, both
spectra show pronounced structures and diﬀer most sig-
niﬁcantly at θ = 180◦. Whereas for a phase of ϕ = π
the photoelectron spectrum is only faintly structured, a
rich interference carpet appears for a phase of ϕ = 1.5π.
In the latter, a series of energy peaks with a spacing of
about 3 eV are observed at θ = 180◦, 180◦ ± 15◦, and
180◦ ± 25◦.

To understand these interference structures, we turn
to the strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA) theory. In the
SFA theory, the transition amplitude of the photoelec-
tron from the initial bound state |ψ0(cid:105) to the ﬁnal Volkov
state (cid:12)
(cid:11) with the ﬁnal momentum p is given by [32, 33]

the experiment (peak intensities for 800/400 nm are
0.2/2 × 1014 W/cm2) and the Ip of argon decreased by
1.07 eV (to 14.69 eV) for obtaining agreement with the
peak energies observed in the experiment [37]. Our cal-
culations exhibit very distinct energy bands with a spac-
ing of 1.5 eV, which are due to an inter-cycle interference
that arises from the 800 nm component of the OTC ﬁeld.
However, for ϕ = 1.5π the energy interval along θ = 180◦
is about 3 eV. At θ = 180◦ ± 13◦ a second set of peaks
is present with an energy interval of 3 eV and an oﬀ-
set of about 1.5 eV. Furthermore, a third set of peaks,
also with an energy interval of 3 eV, appears at about
θ = 180◦ ± 24◦. There is no energy oﬀset with respect
to the ﬁrst set of peaks at θ = 180◦. These distinct
features, marked by arrows in Fig. 2(b), are in quali-
tative agreement with the experimental observations in
Fig. 2(a). Below we will show that the appearance of
the peaks with the energy interval of 3 eV at θ = 180◦
is due to the inter-cycle interference of the 400 nm ﬁeld,
while the second and third set of peaks are closely re-
lated to a newly uncovered intra-cycle interference, i.e.,
a non-adjacent intra-cycle interference, the focus of this
Letter.

The temporal grating created by the 800 nm compo-
nent dominates the calculated energy spectrum. This
discrepancy is due to the fact that the simulation in
Fig. 2(b) assumes a continuous-wave (cw) OTC ﬁeld,
whereas the experiment has a pulse envelope with a full
width at half maximum of intensity of 45 fs.
In order
to remove the cw eﬀect in the simulation, we follow a
procedure that was used previously for a linearly polar-
ized two-color ﬁeld [7] and restrict the ionization time of
quantum orbits in Eq. (3) to one cycle of the 800 nm
ﬁeld for the remainder of the discussion. The resulting
photoelectron spectrum is shown in Fig. 2(c). Thereby, a
better agreement with the experimental data is achieved.
In comparison to Fig. 2(b), it is clear that the inter-cycle
interference features from the 800 nm ﬁeld, i.e., the ATI
structures with energy spacing of 1.5 eV, disappear. On
the other hand, the prominent interference carpet fea-
ture at around 180◦, as observed in the experiment, still
persists. A closer inspection reveals some discrepancy
between the experimental data and the SFA simulation,
for example in the relative electron yields for diﬀerent
angle and energy ranges. These can be ascribed to the
inﬂuence of the parent ion’s Coulomb potential, which is
neglected in the present SFA theory but in OTC ﬁelds
can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the relative electron
yields emitted along diﬀerent directions [38].

To understand the origin of the interference carpet at
around 180◦ observed for ϕ = 1.5π, we divide the elec-
tric ﬁeld and vector potential of the one-cycle OTC pulse
into 8 parts, i.e., A1-A4 and B1-B4, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
The top axis in Fig. 3(a) indicates the limits of the emis-
sion angle θ in the polarization plane for each quarter
cycle of the 400 nm component of the OTC pulse based

suﬃciently high intensity and low frequency of the laser

ated with high accuracy by the saddle-point method [34].
The corresponding transition amplitude then becomes

and the index s runs over the relevant saddle points ob-
tained by solving the saddle point equation [p + A(t)]2 =

bit. Physically, the transition amplitude Mp represents
the coherent superposition of all quantum orbits [35, 36].
Eq. (3) thus provides an intuitive formulation of interfer-
ence patterns in photoelectron spectra.

on the mapping of the ionization time to ﬁnal momentum
within the SMM, i.e., p = −A(t). For example, the elec-
tron emitted from A1 and A4 with Az > 0 and Ax < 0
will arrive at the detector with a ﬁnal momentum pz < 0
and px > 0, contributing to the spectra at an angle of
90◦ < θ < 180◦. In Fig. 3(b) our SFA analysis conﬁrms
that photoelectrons from within the ionization time win-
dows A2 and A3 of our OTC pulse will be detected at
an angle of 0◦ < θ < 90◦. However, photoelectrons emit-
ted within the ionization time windows A1 and A4 are
detected at 90◦ < θ < 270◦, well outside their classically
permitted region [see Fig. 3(c)]. Similar results can be
also found for other regions of spectra shown in Figs. 3(d)
and (e).

Comparing with the left panel of Fig. 2(c), the inter-
ference patterns at 0◦ < θ < 90◦ are due to interfering
electron trajectories emitted from adjacent quarter cycles
of the 400 nm (A2 and A3). In contrast, the stripes at
90◦ < θ < 270◦ visible for ϕ = 1.5π in Fig. 2(c) are from
the interference of two orbits from non-adjacent quarters
of the 400 nm ﬁeld (A1 and A4, B1 and B4). The ﬁrst
kind of intra-cycle interference has been widely investi-
gated in the literature [7, 8, 39, 40].
In contrast, the
second type (i.e., non-adjacent) intra-cycle interference
has not been observed or identiﬁed before, to the best of
our knowledge.

Our SFA simulations show that the interference fringes
from this novel non-adjacent intra-cycle interference are
much ﬁner than that of the adjacent intra-cycle inter-
ference. The reason is that the ionization delays of the
electron orbits for the non-adjacent intra-cycle interfer-
ence are larger than those of the adjacent ones and, thus,
the change of the corresponding action diﬀerence of the
two orbits is more sensitive to the momentum of the pho-
toelectron. This result is analogous to the double-slit in-
terference [22], for which the stripe width on the screen is
inversely proportional to the distance of the two slits. It
is this novel intra-cycle interference, through which the
ﬁne and bent fringes at 90◦ < θ < 270◦ for ϕ = 1.5π
are formed. Together with the inter-cycle interference
by the 800 nm ﬁeld, they give rise to the appearance of
the second and third sets of peaks at 167◦ and 156◦, re-
spectively, with an energy interval of 3 eV and an energy
oﬀset of 1.5 eV with respect to each other [see Figs. 2(a)
and (c)].

It is worth noting that the above-discussed non-
adjacent intra-cycle interference is strongly dependent on
the phase delay of the OTC pulse. For example, the right
panels of Figs. 2(a) and (b) show that for the OTC pulse
with ϕ = π, the pronounced interference structure dis-
appears in the experiment and the corresponding SFA
simulation. The reason is that for the laser pulse with
ϕ = π, only the traditional adjacent intra-cycle inter-
ference from the adjacent quarters can exist. Therefore,
after removing the inter-cycle interference in Fig. 2(c) by

restricting the integration to one cycle, no clear carpet
structure can be observed in the spectrum for an OTC
pulse with ϕ = π.

One may argue that this novel intra-cycle interference
from the non-adjacent quarters should also exist and
might be observed for a single-color ﬁeld (see also recent
work by Maxwell et al.
[41]). However, for a single-
color ﬁeld, the two kinds of the intra-cycle interference
structures usually appear in the same regions of the mo-
mentum space. Thus, the overlap of the two types of
intra-cycle interferences obscures the non-adjacent intra-
cycle interference in the spectra. In contrast, by adding a
weak 800 nm ﬁeld with ϕ = 1.5π in the x direction, as we
have demonstrated in this Letter, the two orbits corre-
sponding to the adjacent intra-cycle interference will be
driven to diﬀerent quarters of the photoelectron spectra
and thus the non-adjacent intra-cycle interference can be
easily disentangled and be observed in the experiments.
Concluding, we have demonstrated that the tempo-

ral grating in an OTC pulse can separate two classes

dimensional character of the OTC ﬁeld maps their contri-
butions to diﬀerent regions in momentum space facilitat-
ing their disentanglement. We envision that the coupling
of sub-cycle time and space provided by OTC ﬁelds, as
demonstrated by our experiment, can be exploited also
for observing attosecond phenomena that lead to spatio-
temporal variations of charge density. Careful analysis of
intra-cycle interferences in OTC ﬁelds should thus permit
the observation of sub-cycle variations of the ionization
probability, caused, for example, by hole-wavepackets af-
ter ionization [42, 43]. This might be of particular inter-
est for studying charge density oscillations in molecules
that are properly oriented with respect to the spatio-
temporal evolution of the OTC ﬁeld. We believe that
photoelectron intra-cycle interferometry has a potential
for resolving attosecond dynamics that is largely un-
tapped. OTC pulses hold a key to unlock this potential.
