Abstract
Recently, two strong homologous white light ﬂares of X-GOES class occurred on
the Sun on Sept. 06, 2017, providing a rare exceptional opportunity to study the
mechanisms responsible for the formation of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations
suitable for the manifestation of such yet enigmatic eruptive events and their
eﬀects in the lower layers of the solar atmosphere.
Using photospheric vector magnetograms, taken before the beginning of the two
X-class events, as boundary conditions to reconstruct the non−linear coronal
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, we identiﬁed two related 3D null points located at
low heights above the photosphere (i.e. in very low corona). These null points
are most likely responsible for the triggering of the two strong X-GOES class
ﬂares. We deduced that their formation at such low altitudes may plausibly be
ascribed to the peculiar photospheric horizontal motions of the main magnetic
structures of the hosting Active Region NOAA 12673.
These events can be adopted as a hint for a possible interpretation of the activity
of young G-type stars, recently reported by the Kepler mission. We argued that a
possible explanation of the acceleration of huge numbers of particles producing
white light emission, during the Sept. 6 events as well as during white light
ﬂares in young Sun-like stars, might be attributed to the special accompanying
conditions of the occurrence of magnetic reconnection at low altitudes of their
atmospheres.

1. Introduction

The most energetic ﬂares occurring on the Sun are dynamical phenomena in-
volving the whole solar atmosphere with important eﬀects at photospheric level.
During these events electron beams, characterized by particular high energy,
reach the chromosphere which in turns, owing to its radiative heating, stimu-
lates the photospheric emission (white light ﬂares) (WLFs; Svestka (1966)). The
involved physical mechanism for the energy transportation from the upper chro-
mosphere to the photosphere where the WL emission takes place is well known as
“back-warming eﬀect” (Machado, Emslie, and Avrett, 1989). The duration of the
optical continuum emission at photospheric level is found to vary, but usually
associated to the impulsive phase of the corresponding ﬂares. Worth noticing
here that it is widely accepted by the scientiﬁc community that the white light
emission is a common feature of all solar ﬂares (see Matthews et al. (2003); Jess
et al. (2008); Hudson, Wolfson, and Metcalf (2006)), with the more energetic is
the ﬂare, the more detectable is the white light contribution. In fact, the energy
required to power the white light emission can be similar to the total energy
carried by an electron beam (Metcalf et al., 2003). However, the need of a better
and deeper understanding of the physics behind the mechanisms leading to the
acceleration of particles and hence the increase of the emission in the continuum
of the solar spectra or in white light images remains a challenging topic and one
of the highest priorities for the worldwide solar physics community investigation
(see e.g. Machado, Emslie, and Avrett (1989); Fang and Ding (1995); Ding et
al. (2003); Romano et al. (2018)).

Interestingly, the Kepler mission has recently revealed the occurrence of
extremely energetic ﬂares, named “superﬂares”, on G-type stars. These super-
ﬂares are characterized by energies several orders of magnitude greater than the
observed strongest solar events, i.e. up to 1038 erg. They have been observed
in Kepler broad optical passband from 400 to 900 nm and, for this reason,
according to the standard solar terminology, they are also dubbed “WLFs”.
Additionally, they seem to occur more often on cooler G-type stars (Tef f =
5100−5600 K) with faster rotational periods (from few hours to several days)
than on hotter stars (Tef f = 5600−6000 K) characterized by slower rotational
periods (> 10 days) (Maehara et al., 2012; Shibayama et al., 2013). Balona (2015)
found that these WLF’s associated energies appear to be strongly correlated with
stellar luminosity and radius. However, only limited attention was devoted to
understanding the mechanisms of their emission.

In spite of the diversity in physical parameters and energy budget between
solar ﬂares and superﬂares, we believe that the study of solar WLFs can provide
clues for the study of the stronger events occurring on other stars. Therefore,
in order to understand why stars younger and smaller than the Sun are able
to produce eruptive events at such a very high energy domain, which cannot
in principle occur on the Sun (Aulanier et al., 2013), we need to scrutinize the

characteristics and peculiarities of the observed strongest events recorded to date
in the solar atmosphere. In fact, the study of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations
able to host the strongest events occurring on the Sun, as well as the involved
precursor structures and topologies, can shed light even on the mechanisms at the
base of superﬂares where a more eﬃcient acceleration of particles seems to take
place. Typical examples of strong solar events able to show clearly their eﬀect in
the low solar atmosphere are the sequence of X-class ﬂares recorded from mid-
October to early November 2003 (peaked on October 28), with a ﬂare magnitude
estimated as large as X45-class (Thomson, Rodger, and Dowden, 2004), or the
famous Bastille Day Flare (X5.7) occurred on July 14, 2000. In these cases,
it has been observed that the bright ribbons exceeding the brightness of the
surrounding photosphere by up to 20-30% were located above or near the main
sunspots. In particular, in the Bastille Day Flare, Grechnev et al. (2008) found
that the regions involved in the emission in diﬀerent spectral ranges seemed to
be associated with particle acceleration arising at low heights above the main
sunspots. Various observations support the idea that their continuum emission
at photospheric level may be correlated with low heights of the reconnection
sites in the solar atmosphere (Ni et al., 2016).

In order to provide further evidences and contributions in favor of this scenario
and possibly probe the conditions for the magnetic reconnection to occur at low
altitudes, we study, in the present work, two interesting homologous WLFs of
X-class (X2.2 and X9.3) hosted by AR NOAA 12673. These events occurred
on 2017 September 06, with about 3-hr time interval, between their peaks: the
ﬁrst ﬂare peaked at 09:10 UT, while the second one at 12:02 UT (Figure 1).
They oﬀer a rare opportunity to explore two energetic events characterized by
similar conﬁguration of the involved magnetic systems but with diﬀerent extent
of their eﬀects at photospheric level. The intriguing evolution of AR NOAA
12673 were subject of recent devoted eﬀorts and a series of investigations (Sun
and Norton, 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Romano et al., 2018; Verma, 2018; Wang et
al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018). Sun and Norton (2017) for example highlighted the
relevance of the unusual and signiﬁcant emerging new magnetic ﬂux in triggering
the ﬂares. Some aspects of the magnetic ﬁeld topology and the strong transverse
magnetic ﬁelds have been reported by Yang et al. (2017), Romano et al. (2018)
and Wang et al. (2018). The main peculiarity of these events were the strong
horizontal displacement of part of the main sunspot of the active region (AR)
that seems to have an important role in the storage of the magnetic free energy
(Romano et al., 2018). Hence, these two homologous WLFs can be considered as
interesting targets to understand the role of the sunspot motions in WLFs as well
as to examine the mechanisms leading to the formation of the main magnetic
reconnection site at low height above the photosphere. Moreover, our analysis of
these events is also used to suggest a possible explanation of the strong activity
in young G-type stars and their white light emission during superﬂares.

We studied the conditions that lead to the occurrence of these events by
the dataset and the methods of analysis described in Section 2, focusing on
determining the location of 3D null points, aiming to inspect and comprehend
the related coronal magnetic conditions able to generate recurrent WLFs. We
highlighted the main results in Section 3. Finally we discussed and interpreted
our ﬁndings in Section 4.

2. Data and analysis

The AR NOAA 12673 has been observed to sojourn the solar disk on Sept. 2017.
Among the 40 C, 20 M and 4 X-class ﬂares unleashed by the AR, we analyzed
the physical conditions for the occurrence of the strong X2.2 and X9.3 class
ﬂares occurred on Sept. 06 during a time interval of few hours (Figure 1). In
particular, the most energetic event excited an unusual sunquake phenomena.
More details about the timing of the two events have been reported in Romano
et al. (2018).

In this work, we focused on the coronal magnetic conﬁguration at the base of
such strong events developed in rapid succession in the same AR. In particular
we highlight the various peculiarities of the two events, addressing the point of
identifying the 3D null points as a key ingredient in understanding the magnetic
topology associated to the WLF episode. In order to reconstruct the 3D coronal
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration we adopted the non-linear force-free (NLFF) extrap-
olation method proposed by He, Wang, and Yan (2011) and based on the direct
boundary integral equation (DBIE) formulation (Yan and Li, 2006). We used as
boundary conditions for the NLFF ﬁeld extrapolations the vector magnetograms
taken by HMI (Schmidt et al., 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin (2012)) in the Fe I line at 617.3
nm and pixel size of 0.′′51. We utilized the data in the Space-weather Active
Region Patches (SHARPs) version (Hoeksema et al., 2014) taken on Sept. 06 at
00:00 UT, 08:48 UT and 11:48 UT, exploiting hence the reconstruction of the
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in diﬀerent phases (i.e. before, after and between the
peaks). The input 2D photospheric vector magnetograms for the extrapolations
process were 70 × 70 pixels (rebinned data) with a ﬁeld of view of 176 ′′ × 176
′′, corresponding to a resolution of 2.′′51/pixel. The output 3D coronal magnetic
ﬁelds were 70 × 70 × 40 grids with the photospheric magnetogram being retained
in the output 3D data as the bottom layer (layer 0) of the data cube.

We applied the method outlined in Beveridge (2006) to the output NLFF
ﬁeld data cubes in order to determine the coronal null points, i.e. the locations
where the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes and the reconnection can take place (Priest
and Forbes, 2000). This method allows indeed to ﬁnd 3D null points in two steps.
First, it applies a spine graph analysis which reduces the complicated topological
footprint to a graph theory problem and infers the existence of almost all of the
separators, i.e. the ﬁeld line connecting two null points which comes from the
intersection of two separatrix surfaces of diﬀerent magnetic systems. Second,
it employs a simulated annealing method: in analogy to annealing in crystals,
in which the lowest-energy state is found over large length scales by making
small random perturbations to its current state, the method permits to assess
which nulls are connected by separators. Finally, among the nulls found by the
algorithm we selected only those located above the boundary conditions of the
extrapolations.

Taking into account the noticeable horizontal displacement of the negative
polarity of the main sunspot of the AR, we also used vector magnetograms
taken with a time interval of 24 min to derive the horizontal velocity ﬁelds by
means of the DAVE4VM method. As described in Schuck (2008), the velocity

was modeled by a variational principle to minimize deviations in the magnitude
of the magnetic induction equation constrained by a 3D aﬃne velocity proﬁle,
which depends linearly on coordinates, within a windowed subregion of the
magnetogram sequence. In this case we used a full width at half maximum of
the apodization window of 11 pixels.

Furthermore, and to highlight the eﬀect of the photospheric horizontal ve-
locities on the overlying magnetic systems, we follow the approach of Falconer,
Moore, and Gary (2002) and Jiang et al. (2014) to measure the shear angle, i.e.
the angle between the observed horizontal ﬁeld and the horizontal ﬁeld derived
through a potential ﬁeld extrapolation. We adopted the horizontal shear angle
equation deﬁned as (Gosain and Venkatakrishnan, 2010):

We also quantiﬁed the diﬀerence between the inclination angle of the observed

ﬁeld γobs and that of the potential ﬁeld γpot:

∆γ = γobs − γpot,

(2)

named as “dip angle”, which can be considered as a measure of the vertical
shear. In fact, the closer the ﬁeld approaches the potential ﬁeld conﬁguration, the
smaller is the value of the inclination diﬀerence (Gosain and Venkatakrishnan,
2010).

In addition, RHESSI data are used to reconstruct the signal for 12−25 keV
and 25−50 KeV bands around the peaks of the two WLFs. We obtained a spatial
resolution of 4 arcsec by means of the use of 4 detectors, that were operational
during the observation period of these ﬂares. We applied the CLEAN method
(Hurford et al., 2002) with an integration interval of 4 s.

3. Results

In the continuum images observed by SDO/HMI, AR NOAA 12673 appears to
be constituted by a main delta spot (S1), surrounded by some smaller spots
(S2-S5) in the Northern and Southern parts of the AR (left panel of Figure 2).
In the delta spot we distinguish four umbrae. Three of them, indicated by U 1,
U 2 and U 3 in the middle of left panel of Figure 2, have positive polarity, while
the eastern one, marked by U 4, has negative polarity and appears on Sept. 06
at 00:10 UT as divided by a thin light bridge.

Strong shear motions have been observed in S1 before the two homologous
WLFs as well as during the time interval between them. In particular, U 4 showed
a displacement of tens of arcsec in the northern direction, with an average
velocity of 0.4 km s−1 for several hours, hence producing some variations of
the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration yielding to favorable conditions for

P. Romano et al. et al.

the occurrence of the strong events with eﬀects in the low layers of the solar
atmosphere (see Romano et al. (2018) for further details). Two snapshots of
the main delta spot before the beginning of the two ﬂares, with the velocity
ﬁelds computed adopting the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator method
for vector magnetograms (DAVE4VM; Schuck, 2008), are reported in Figure
3. Interestingly, the northward displacement of the umbra U 4 was in addition
accompanied by the southward motions of the magnetic features, forming the
remaining part of the sunspot (U 1)(compare Figures. 2 and 3). In particular,
the northern portion of the negative polarity, which seems to divide the positive
polarity in two parts, shows velocities up to 0.7 km s−1 at 11:36 UT, i.e. few
minutes before the beginning of the second WLF (see the right panel of Figure
3).

This particular behavior of the photospheric features is also conﬁrmed through
the topology of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. In the top panel of Figure 4 the
transverse ﬁeld vectors are overplotted on a Bz map background (in Cylindrical
Equal Area (CEA) coordinates), while the bottom panels are the zoomed views
of the region of interest (i.e. enclosed by a box in top panel), before the ﬁrst peak
(at 08:36 UT), between the two peaks (at 10:00 UT) and hours after the second
peak (at 17:00 UT). The strong shear topology along the PIL, as well as the
evident counterclockwise rotation of the north-eastern component of the negative
polarity are evidently highlighted by the structure and temporal evolution of the
horizontal ﬁelds. Both the transverse and velocity ﬁelds maps clearly indicate
the AR being theater of strong and long-continued photospheric motions accom-
panied with a substantial shear along the main PIL. It is noteworthy that these
motions persist for about 24 hours until the end of the second ﬂare, suggesting
the shear motions being an important mechanism capable of supplying new
energy into the magnetic systems of the AR involved by the ﬂares.

The main peculiar characteristics of the two ﬂares hosted by AR NOAA 12673
on Sept. 06, 2017, are their homology and emission in the continuum. Although
the energy delivered by these ﬂares (X2.2 and X9.7 GOES class) is not excep-
tional, these two reported characteristics undoubtedly make them unique targets
for the interpretation of the diﬀerent amount of energy involved in homologous
events and its deposition at photospheric level.

The enhancement of the emission at photospheric level of the two events is
shown in the continuum by HMI during the ﬂare peaks. Exploiting the HMI
resolution we detected small kernels of emission over the main spot during the
X2.2 class ﬂare (left panel of Figure 5). The area of these kernels reaches a
total maximum extension of about 2.4 × 106 km2. Obviously, the photospheric
emission of the second ﬂare is more intense and exhibits a clear ribbon shape,
including the same regions previously involved by the kernels of the ﬁrst ﬂare
(right panel of Figure 5). The area covered by the ribbons in the continuum
ﬁltergram at 11:59 UT reaches a maximum extension of about 9.2 × 107 km2.
The ribbons are located at both sides of the PIL: the eastern one runs along the
umbra U 4, while the western one, almost parallel to the other ribbon, reaches
the south-western edge of the main spot.

The homology of the two WLFs is demonstrated not only in the similar
morphology of the chromospheric ribbons, but also in the brightening of the

3D null points in two WLFs.

coronal magnetic systems of the AR observed during the main phases of both
events.

In the top left panel of Figure 6 we display the ribbons observed by INAF-
Catania Astrophysical Observatory on Sept. 06, 2011, at 09:31 UT, where three
main kernels, indicated by R1 − R3, are clearly distinguishable. Only the kernel
R1 had a correspondent kernel at photospheric level (compare the left panel of
Figure 5 and the top left panel of Figure 6). In the top left panel of Figure 6
we also marked the location of the ﬂux peak at 12−25 keV taken by RHESSI
at 9:10 UT, i.e. around the peak of the ﬁrst WLF observed by GOES at 1−8
˚A. It is noteworthy that the hard X-ray source is located above the ribbon R1
in the center of the delta spot, i.e. where the small photospheric kernels have
been observed by HMI. The Hα ribbons of the X9.7 class ﬂare have almost the
same location and shape like those in the ﬁrst ﬂare (top right panel of Figure
6). In addition, we note a newly appearing smaller ribbon, indicated as R4. Its
location corresponds to the eastern ribbon in the continuum ﬁltergrams (compare
the right panel of Figure 5 and the top right panel of Figure 6). The ﬂux peak
at 12:09 UT, observed by RHESSI at 12−25 keV, appears again over the ribbon
R1, although this time it is closer to the PIL and to the new ribbon R4.

Thinner homologous ribbons are also observed at 1600 ˚A by AIA (bottom
panels of Figure 6). In this spectral line, emitted by the C IV, we observe the
contribution of the upper photosphere and the transition region. The main diﬀerence
between the two ﬂares at this wavelength is that a new ribbon is visible during the
second ﬂare, as already noted in the continuum and in the Hα line.

The observation of the AR at coronal level conﬁrms the homology of the two ﬂares
too. In fact, the images taken at 211 ˚A by AIA before the beginning of the WLFs,
reported in Figure 7, show the brightening of the same bundles of loops at 8:39 UT
and 11:45 UT. An interesting feature, mainly visible at 8:39 UT, is an helical structure
crossing the AR from [-230′′,500′′] to [-300′′,540′′]. The same feature appears at 11:45
UT, although in this case it is covered by some bright and straight loops located along
the north−south direction.

The presence of these stressed features is also conﬁrmed by the maps of the evaluated
o
shear and dip angles reported in Figure 8. A shear angle greater than 90
is visible in
a wide portion of the main sunspot along the PIL. In particular, we note very high
values of the shear angle, exceeding 120o, along the umbra of negative polarity and in
the northern portion of the positive polarity, both at 8:46 UT and at 11:46 UT (top left
and top right panels of Figure 8, respectively). An interesting alternation of positive
and negative dip angle values crossing the PIL from east to west documents also the
importance of the vertical shear of the magnetic ﬁeld along the whole PIL, probably
as a consequence of the observed horizontal velocity ﬁelds (see the bottom panels of
Figure 8).

To further investigate and determine the magnetic topology associated to the two
WLFs as well as to understand how the strong horizontal motions are able to produce
appropriate conditions for the occurrence of the magnetic reconnection at the base
of these events, we performed three non-linear force-free extrapolations adopting as
boundary conditions the vector magnetograms taken by the SDO/HMI instrument on
Sept 06 at 00:00 UT, 08:48 UT and 11:48 UT, i.e. several hours before the two WLFs,
few minutes before the beginning of the X2.2 ﬂare and few minutes before the beginning
of the X9.3 ﬂare, respectively. These extrapolations are reported in Figure 9. Initially,
in the area involved by the WLFs we distinguish three main arcades corresponding to
diﬀerent magnetic domains and to diﬀerent connectivity of the photospheric magnetic

structures (“(a)” and “(b)” panels of Figure 9). The negative umbra of the delta spot
U 4 seems to be connected to the positive polarity located in the southern part of
the AR (blue lines) and corresponding to the spot S5 of Figure 2. Instead, the main
positive umbrae of the delta spot (U 1 and U 2 in Figure 2) are linked to the negative
pores S3 − S4 in the northern part of the AR (yellow lines). A third arcade connects
the positive polarity at north of the negative umbra (U 3 in Figure 2) with the negative
spot S2 at the northern edge of the main sunspot (red lines). About 8 hours later the
magnetic topology of the corona appears to be clearly reconﬁgured (see panels “(c)”
and “(d)” of Figure 9). A 3D null point is actually formed over the polarity inversion
line between U 4 and U 3. Our computations indicate it to be located relatively low in
the solar atmosphere, i.e. at about 5000 km above the boundary level. It is noteworthy
that the projected position of this null point over the solar disk coincides with the
contours indicating 70% and 90% of the ﬂux peak at 12−25 keV taken by RHESSI.
Moreover, we note that the ribbon locations observed in the chromosphere correspond
to the footpoints of the magnetic ﬂux systems determined from the extrapolation,
namely: the ribbon R1 is located at the base of the northern footpoints of the ﬁeld
lines indicated by the blue lines, the ribbon R2 corresponds to the northern footpoints
of the red lines while the ribbon R3 to the northern footpoints of the yellow lines.
In principle, a reconnection occurring in that 3D null point can be responsible of the
particle acceleration along the traced ﬁeld lines and hence can explain the observed
ribbons of the X2.2 class ﬂare.

The third extrapolation shown in the panels “(e)” and “(f )” of Figure 9 is charac-
terized by some small diﬀerences in comparison with the previous one. We recognize
the same magnetic ﬂux systems of the extrapolation obtained from the vector magne-
tograms taken before the ﬁrst WLF, however, in this case, a new 3D null point appears
near the position of the previous one and lower in the involved computational volume.
Its position corresponds to about 3000 km above the photosphere, and is located over
the small ﬂux rope displayed by the red ﬁeld lines, that connects the northern edge of
the negative umbra (U 4) with the contiguous positive polarity (U 3). We remark that
the involvement of this ﬂux rope in the second events is conﬁrmed by the new appearing
ribbon R4 (upper right panel of Figure 6), which was not observed during the previous
ﬂare and which was located in an area corresponding to the eastern footpoints of the
ﬂux rope.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The homologous WLFs occurred on Sept. 06, 2017, hosted by AR NOAA 12637 allowed
us to consider and emphasize some interesting aspects concerning the sources of the
continuum emission observed at photospheric level and to provide some clue hints to
interpret the analogous WLFs recently observed in young Sun-like stars by the Kepler
mission.

One of the main interesting aspects of the studied events is their homology, indu-
bitably inferred by means of multiwavelength observations analysis as well as through
force-free extrapolations performed using as boundary conditions the vector magne-
tograms taken by HMI in the Fe I line at 617.3 nm.

The AIA images taken at 211 ˚A, corresponding to the high corona at two million
K, showed the involvement of the same magnetic systems during both ﬂares. The
brightest regions observed during the corresponding preﬂare phases, i.e. before that
the ﬂare emissions saturated the detector, highlighted indeed similar structures despite
of both the three hours time interval between the two ﬂare peaks and the reported

signiﬁcant displacement of the main photospheric magnetic structures. Moreover, the
similar shapes of the ribbons of both ﬂares at 1600 ˚A and in the core of the Hα line
support the idea that the particle acceleration occurred along the same magnetic ﬁeld
lines reaching the lower layers of the solar atmosphere in the same regions. Therefore,
we argue that the diﬀerent emission at photospheric level observed during the peak of
the two ﬂares was most likely related to the diﬀerent amount of free energy release.
In eﬀect, although the area covered by the continuum emission of the two events
diﬀered by one order of magnitude, the photospheric ribbons of the X9.7 class ﬂare
included the same regions previously covered by the kernels of the X2.2 class ﬂare. This
result suggests that the extent of the photospheric area aﬀected by the chromospheric
radiative heating may depend by the total energy of the electrons accelerated along
the same ﬁeld lines. It is also noteworthy that, contrary to the TiO emissions observed
by Yurchyshyn et al. (2017), in these ﬂares the photospheric emissions appear co-
spatial with chromospheric ﬂare ribbons implying that both eﬀects originate in the
same chromospheric/photospheric volume.

A central key ingredient for the interpretation of the diﬀerent amount of energy
delivered by the two WLFs has been investigated through the analysis of NLFF ex-
trapolations. Before the beginning of both ﬂares a 3D null point in the low corona
has been identiﬁed. Interestingly, many theoretical studies point out that 3D null
points may be sites for magnetic reconnection (Priest and Pontin, 2009; Galsgaard and
Pontin, 2011). Moreover, their role in accelerating particles is supported by several
simulations (see Baumann, Haugbolle, and Nordlund (2013) and references therein).
For this reason we think that the presence of these 3D null points, located exactly
above the northern portion of the negative polarity of the main sunspot, where the
higher values of horizontal velocity ﬁeld have been observed, may have a crucial role in
the ﬂare trigger and in the acceleration of the electrons reaching the lower layers of the
solar atmosphere. This is conﬁrmed not only by the precise correspondence between
the ribbons locations and the footpoints of the extrapolated magnetic systems, but
more interestingly by the emission registered by RHESSI in the HXR at 12−25 keV
corresponding to the location of the 3D null points. In fact, low-energy HXR sources
have been interpreted in some previous studies as highly related to the outﬂow in
vicinity of the reconnection site (e.g., Sui and Holman (2003)).

We remark that, despite of the similar magnetic topology obtained by the NLFF
extrapolations from the vector magnetograms taken few minutes before each ﬂare, a
diﬀerent height of about 2000 km between the two 3D null points has been found.
Taking into account that Ni et al. (2016) simulations demonstrate that the continuum
emission at photospheric level may be correlated with a low height of the reconnection
site in the solar atmosphere, we think that in our homologous WLFs the diﬀerent ﬂare
energy and the corresponding photospheric emission may mainly be attributed to the
variation of the null point height: the lower the 3D null point, the stronger the ﬂare.

There are three possible explanations of the variation of the null point height in
time: (i)- the emergence of new magnetic ﬂux which slightly changes the magnetic
ﬁeld topology of the AR in the low atmosphere, (ii)- the photospheric horizontal
motions which stretches and lowers the magnetic ﬁeld lines and (iii)- a combination of
the previously cited two mechanisms. In our case, the magnetic ﬁeld observations at
photospheric level do not show the emergence of new polarity during the short time
interval between the peaks of the two ﬂares (only 3 hours), instead the northward
motion of the negative polarity of the main spot reaches its maximum velocity (up to
0.7 km s−1) at 11:36 UT (right panel of Figure 3). Consequently, we think that the
stretching of the magnetic ﬁeld lines due to the shear motions, observed for several
hours before the ﬂares and during the time interval between them, can be the main

source of the lower height of the 3D null point, suitable for the trigger of the X9.7 class
ﬂare. In this regard, the maps of the shear and dip angle highly conﬁrm the presence
of considerable magnetic stresses along the PIL and in the regions corresponding to
the strong brightening at chromospheric and coronal level. Therefore, and through our
observations and analysis it seems that energetic ﬂares occurring on the Sun, with
evident eﬀects in the continuum of the spectra, are linked to magnetic reconnection
in the lower layers of the solar atmosphere (Ding, Fang, and Yun, 1999) and that
this may happen when the magnetic systems are stretched by substantial and strong
shear motions. Certainly, we cannot exclude that also the helical structure, visible at
211 ˚A(Figure 7) and the corresponding green and grey arcades in the extrapolations
(Figure 9), play an important role in the evolution of these events, however this is not
in contrast with the above described scenario.

In this context, we believe that the shear motions observed along the PIL of the main
sunspots, together with the high intensity of the involved magnetic ﬂux systems, may be
adopted as a reference for the study of ﬂares occurring on other stars and characterized
by higher orders of magnitude. Of course, two quite common X-class ﬂares can not be
assumed as a paradigm for the interpretation of all ﬂares, but their homology and
their emission in the continuum allow us to consider them as an interesting hint for a
better comprehension of the possible triggering mechanisms of energetic ﬂares/WLFs
in other stars. The main characteristics of cooler G−type stars, where the Kepler
mission detected many superﬂares, recall the main ingredients at the base of the events
subject of the present investigation, i.e., high strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and strong
horizontal velocities. These G−type stars are characterized by an average magnetic
ﬁeld strength higher at least by an order of magnitude than that of the Sun at its
maximum of activity (Katsova and Livshits, 2015). Notsu et al. (2013) showed that
many superﬂares probably occur in large starspots (10 times larger than the largest
sunspot) and that the energy of the superﬂares can be explained by the magnetic energy
stored around such starspots (Shibayama et al., 2013). Moreover, stars with relatively
slower rotation rates can still produce superﬂares that are as energetic as those of more
rapidly rotating stars, but their average ﬂare frequency is lower (Noyes et al., 1984).
This is due to the fact that the fast rotation drives the emergence of strong magnetic
ﬁelds. However, we think that the height of the reconnection site may play also an
important role in the amount of released energy. For this reason in the next future, we
plan to analyze a wide sample of strong solar events, in order to eﬀectively delineate a
possible correlation between the height of 3D null points and the ﬂare energy.
