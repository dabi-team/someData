Detection rates for the elastic and inelastic scattering of weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMP) oﬀ 23Na are calculated within the framework of Deformed Shell Model (DSM) based on
Hartree-Fock states. First the spectroscopic properties like energy spectra and magnetic moments
are calculated and compared with experiment. Following the good agreement for these, DSM wave
functions are used for obtaining elastic and inelastic spin structure functions, nuclear structure
for the WIMP-23Na scattering. Then, the event rates are also calculated with a
coeﬃcients etc.
given set of supersymmetric parameters. In the same manner, using DSM wavefunctions, nuclear
structure coeﬃcients and event rates for elastic scattering of WIMP from 40Ar are also obtained.
These results for event rates and also for annual modulation will be useful for the upcoming and
future WIMP detection experiments involving detectors with 23Na and 40Ar.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There is now universal agreement among the cosmolo-
gists, astronomers and physicists that most of the mass
of the universe is dark [1–3]. There are overwhelming
evidences to believe that the dark matter is mostly non-
baryonic. Also, data from the Cosmic Background Ex-
plorer (COBE) [4] and Supernova Cosmology project [5]
suggest that most of the dark matter is cold. The non-
baryonic cold dark matter is not yet observed in earth-
bound experiments and hence its nature is still a mys-
tery. Axions are one of the candidates for dark matter
but they are not yet observed [1, 6]. However, the most
promising nonbaryonic cold dark matter candidates are
the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) which
arise in super symmetric theories of physics beyond the
standard model. The most appealing WIMP candidate
is the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) (lightest
neutralino) which is expected to be stable and interacts
weakly with matter [1, 7].

There are many experimental eﬀorts [8–11] to detect
WIMP via their scattering from the nuclei of the detector
providing ﬁnger-prints regarding their existence. Some of
these are Super CDMS SNOLAB project, XENON1T,
PICO-60, EDELWEISS and so on; see for example
[11–14]. Nuclei 23Na, 40Ar, 71Ga, 73Ge, 75As, 127I,
133Cs and 133Xe are among the popular detector nu-
clei; see [10, 11, 15] and references there in. Our fo-
cus in this paper is on 23Na and 40Ar. The Sodium
Iodide (NaI) Advanced Detector (NAID) array experi-
ment is a direct search experiment for WIMP operated by
UK Dark Matter Collaboration in North Yorkshire [16];
the NaI contains 23Na. Similarly, the DAMA/NaI and
DAMA/LiBRA [17] experiments investigated the pres-
ence of dark matter particles in the galactic halo using

∗rankasahu@gmail.com
†vkbkota@prl.res.in

the NaI(Tl) detector. In these experiments, the predicted
annual modulation was not yet conﬁrmed [11]. Other re-
lated experiments with NaI detectors are ANAIS [18] and
DM-Ice [19]. Also, there are the important DARKSIDE-
50 [20] and DEAP-3600 [21] experiments using lquid Ar-
gon (with 40Ar) as detector.

Let us add that direct detection experiments are ex-
posed to various neutrino emissions. The interaction
of these neutrinos especially the astrophysical neutrinos
with the material of the dark matter detectors known as
the neutrino ﬂoor is a serious background source. Re-
cently the coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos oﬀ nu-
clei (CEνNS) has been observed at the Spallation Neu-
tron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory [22]
employing the technology used in the direct detection of
dark matter searches. The impacts of the neutrino ﬂoor
on the relevant experiments looking for cold dark matter
was investigated for example in [23].

There are many theoretical calculations which de-
scribe diﬀerent aspects of direct detection of dark mat-
ter through the recoil of the nucleus in WIMP-nucleus
scattering. For elastic scattering, we need to consider
spin-spin interaction coming from the axial current and
also the more dominant scalar interaction. For inelastic
part, scalar interaction practically does not contribute.
The scalar interaction can arise from squark exchange,
Higgs exchange, the interaction of WIMPs with gluons
etc. Suhonen and his collaborators have performed a
series of truncated shell model calculations for this pur-
pose [24–28].
In these studies, for example they have
calculated the event rates for WIMP-nucleus elastic and
inelastic scattering for 83Kr and 125Te [28] and also 127I,
129,131Xe and 133Cs [26]. In addition, recently Vergados
et al [29] examined the possibility of detecting electrons
in the searches for light WIMP with a mass in the MeV
region and found that the events of 0.5-2.5 per kg-y would
be possible. Few years back full large-scale shell-model
calculations are carried out in [15, 30] for WIMP scat-
tering oﬀ 129,131Xe, 127I, 73Ge, 19F, 23Na, 27Al and 29Si
nuclei. Finally, using large scale shell model [31] and

 
 
 
 
 
 
coupled cluster theory [32] WIMP-nucleus and neutrino-
nucleus scattering respectively, with 40Ar, are studied.

In recent years, the deformed shell model (DSM),
based on Hartree-Fock (HF) deformed intrinsic states
with angular momentum projection and band mixing,
has been established to be a good model to describe
the properties of nuclei in the mass range A=60-90 [33].
Among many applications, DSM is found to be quite suc-
cessful in describing spectroscopic properties of medium
heavy N=Z odd-odd nuclei with isospin projection [34],
double beta decay half-lives [35, 36] and µ
e conversion
in the ﬁeld of the nucleus [37]. Going beyond these ap-
plications, recently we have studied the event rates for
WIMP with 73Ge as the detector [38]. In addition to the
energy spectra and magnetic moments, the model is used
to calculate the spin structure functions, nuclear struc-
ture factors for the elastic and inelastic scattering. Fol-
lowing this successful study, we have recently used DSM
for calculating the neutrino-ﬂoor due to coherent elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) [23] for the candi-
date nuclei 73Ge, 71Ga, 75As and 127I. We found that
the neutrino-ﬂoor contributions may lead to a distortion
of the expected recoil spectrum limiting the sensitivity
of the direct dark matter search experiments.
In [10],
DSM results for WIMP scattering from 127I, 133Cs and
133Xe are described in detail. To complete these stud-
ies that use DSM for the nuclear structure part, in the
present paper we will present results for WIMP- 23Na
elastic and inelastic scattering and WIMP-40Ar elastic
scattering. Now we will give a preview.

Section II gives, for completeness and easy reading of
the paper, a brief discussion of the formulation of WIMP-
nucleus elastic and inelastic scattering and event rates. In
Section III the DSM formulation is described with exam-
ples drawn from 75As spectroscopic results. In Section
IV, spectroscopic results and also the results for elas-
tic and inelastic scattering of WIMP from 23Na are pre-
sented. Similarly, WIMP-40Ar elastic scattering results
are presented in Section V. The results in Sections IV and
V are the main results of this paper. Finally, concluding
remarks are drawn in Sect. VI.

II. EVENT RATES FOR WIMP-NUCLEUS
SCATTERING

WIMP ﬂux on earth coming from the galactic halo
is expected to be quite large, of the order 105 per cm2
per second. Even though the interaction of WIMP with
matter is weak, this ﬂux is suﬃciently large for the galac-
tic WIMPs to deposit a measurable amount of energy in
an appropriately sensitive detector apparatus when they
scatter oﬀ nuclei. Most of the experimental searches of
WIMP is based on the direct detection through their in-
teraction with nuclei in the detector. The relevant theory
of WIMP-nucleus scattering is well known as available in
the papers by Suhonen and his group and also in our
earlier papers mentioned above [24–26, 28, 38]. For com-

pleteness we give here a few important steps. In the case
of spin-spin interaction, the WIMP couples to the spin
of the nucleus and in the case of scalar interaction, the
WIMP couples to the mass of the nucleus.
In the ex-
pressions for the event rates, the super-symmetric part is
separated from the nuclear part so that the role played
by the nuclear part becomes apparent.

Here, φ which is equal to ρ0v/mχ is the dark matter ﬂux
with ρ0 being the local WIMP density. Similarly, Nt
stands for the number of target nuclei per unit mass and
f is the WIMP velocity distribution which is assumed to
be Maxwell-Boltzmann type. It takes into account the
distribution of the WIMP velocity relative to the detector
(or earth) and also the motion of the sun and earth. If we
neglect the rotation of the earth about its own axis, then
v =

the detector. Also, q represents the momentum transfer
to the nuclear target which is related to the dimensionless

Inelastic scattering

In the inelastic scattering the entrance channel and
exit channel are diﬀerent. The inelastic scattering cross
section due to scalar current is considerably smaller than
the elastic case and hence it is neglected. Hence, we

III. DEFORMED SHELL MODEL

The nucleonic current part has been separated from
nuclear part in the expression for the event rates for
(7) and
elastic and inelastic scattering given by Eqs.

(11) respectively with X(i) giving the nuclear structure
part. However, the Di’s and Ei’s depend not only on
the nuclear structure part but also on the kinematics
and assumptions on the WIMP velocity. The evalua-
tion of X(i) depends on spin structure functions and the
form factors. We have used DSM for the evaluation of
these quantities. Here, for a given nucleus, starting with
a model space consisting of a given set of single particle
(sp) orbitals and eﬀective two-body Hamiltonian (TBME
+ spe), the lowest energy intrinsic states are obtained by
solving the Hartree-Fock (HF) single particle equation
self-consistently. We assume axial symmetry. For exam-
ple, Fig. 1 shows the HF single particle spectrum for 75As
corresponding to the lowest prolate intrinsic state. Used
here are the spherical sp orbits 1p3/2, 0f5/2, 1p1/2, and
0g9/2 with energies 0.0, 0.78, 1.08, and 3.20 MeV, respec-
tively, while the assumed eﬀective interaction is the modi-
ﬁed Kuo interaction [39]. Excited intrinsic conﬁgurations
are obtained by making particle-hole excitations over the
lowest intrinsic state. These intrinsic states χK(η) do not
have deﬁnite angular momenta. Hence, states of good
angular momentum are projected from an intrinsic state
χK(η) and they can be written as,

where NJK is the normalization constant. In Eq. (15), Ω
represents the Euler angles (α, β, γ) and R(Ω) which is
equal to exp(
iγJz) represents
the general rotation operator. The good angular mo-
mentum states projected from diﬀerent intrinsic states
are not in general orthogonal to each other. Hence they
are orthonormalized and then band mixing calculations
are performed. This gives the energy spectrum and the
eigenfunctions. Fig. 2 shows the calculated energy spec-
trum for 75As as an example. In the DSM band mixing
calculations used are six intrinsic states [23]. Let us add
that the eigenfunctions are of the form

The nuclear matrix elements occurring in the calculation
of magnetic moments, elastic and inelastic spin struc-
ture functions etc. are evaluated using the wave function

M (η). For example the calculated magnetic moments
for the 3/21, 3/22 and 5/21 states are (in nm units)
1.422, 1.613 and 0.312 compared to experimental val-
ues [40] 1.439, 0.98 and 0.98 respectively. The calculated
values are obtained using bare gyromagnetic ratios and
the results will be better for the excited states if we take

spin part is small and hence donot appreciably contribute
to the magnetic moments of the above three states. Use
of eﬀective g-factors are advocated in [41].

IV. RESULTS FOR WIMP-23NA SCATTERING

The nuclear structure plays an important role in study-
ing the event rates in WIMP-nucleus scattering. Hence,
we ﬁrst calculate the energy spectra and magnetic mo-
ments within our DSM model for 23Na. Agreement with
experimental data will provide information regarding the
goodness of the wave functions used. This in turn will
give us conﬁdence regarding the reliability of our pre-
dictions on event rates. These spectroscopic results are
presented in Section IV-A. Let us add that in Sections
IV-B and C the value of the oscillator length parameter
b is needed and it is taken to be 1.573 fm for 23Na. In
our earlier work in the calculation of transition matrix
e conversion in 72Ge [37], we had taken
elements for µ
the value of this length parameter as 1.90 fm. Assum-
ing A1/6 dependence, the above values of the oscillator
parameter is chosen for 23Na.

interaction is known to be quite successful in describing
most of the important spectroscopic features of nuclei in
the 1s0d-shell region [42]. For this nucleus, the calcu-
lated lowest HF single particle spectrum of prolate shape
is shown in Fig. 3. The odd proton is in the k = 3/2+ de-
formed single particle orbit. The excited conﬁgurations
are obtained by particle-hole excitations over this lowest
conﬁguration. We have considered a total of ﬁve intrinsic
conﬁgurations. As described above, angular momentum
states are projected from each of these intrinsic conﬁgu-
rations and then a band mixing calculation is performed.
The band mixed wave functions SJ
Kη deﬁned in Eq. (16)
are used to calculate the energy levels, magnetic moments
and other properties of this nucleus.

The calculated levels are classiﬁed into collective bands
on the basis of the E2 transition probabilities between
them. The results for lowest positive parity band for 23Na
are shown in Fig. 4. The experimental data are from Ref.
[40]. For this nucleus, the ground state is 3/2+ which is
reproduced in our calculation. A positive parity band
built on 3/2+ has been identiﬁed for this nucleus. This
band is quite well reproduced by the DSM calculation.
An analysis of the wave functions shows that this band
mainly originates from the lowest HF intrinsic conﬁgu-
ration shown in Fig. 3. However, there are admixtures
from the good angular momentum states coming from
other intrinsic conﬁgurations. The wavefunction com-
ing from the lowest HF intrinsic conﬁguration slightly in-
creases in value with increased angular momentum. This
shows that the collectivity of this band does not change
appreciably at higher angular momentum. Since we are
considering WIMP-nucleus scattering from ground state
and low lying positive parity states, the negative parity
bands are not important for the present purpose.

tron form factors for 23Na for the ground state.

In the calculation of the event rates, spin plays an im-
portant role. Hence, magnetic moment of various low-
lying levels in 23Na are calculated. The result for the
ground state of the lowest K = 3/2+ band is 2.393 nm
and the corresponding available experimental data value
is 2.218 nm. The contribution of protons and neutrons
to the orbital parts are 0.957 and 0.262 and to the spin
parts are 0.267 and 0.014, respectively. This decomposi-
tion gives better physical insight. The calculated value
of magnetic moment for the ground state agrees quite
well with experimental data [40]. Let us add that there
are no experimental data for the magnetic moments of
the excited states. An approach with state-dependent
gyromagnetic moments, as advocated for example in [41]
reproduces better the experimental magnetic moments.
The DSM spectroscopic results are also in good agree-
ment with the full shell model calculations reported in
[15, 30].

B. Results for elastic scattering

The DSM wave functions given by Eq. (16) are used
to calculate the normalized spin structure functions given
in Eq. (4) and also the squared nuclear form factors for
these nuclei. Their values are plotted in Figs. 5 as a func-
tion of u. The static spin matrix elements Ω0 and Ω1 for
the ground state of 23Na have values 0.727 and 0.652
respectively. They compare well with other theoretical
calculations for 23Na given in [15, 30]. An analysis of the
normalized spin structure functions for 23Na in Fig. 5
shows that the values of F00, F01 and F11 diﬀer between
u=0.4-3. Out side this region they are almost degener-
ate. The form factors for proton and neutron in 23Na
are almost identical up to u = 2. Afterwards they dif-
fer and beyond u=2.6 the neutron form factor becomes
larger than proton form factor.

The nuclear structure dependent coeﬃcients given in
(8) are plotted in Fig. 6 for 23Na, as a function

The peaks shift towards higher values of mχ as we go
to larger threshold energy. The thickness of the graphs
represents annual modulation. Annual modulation has
largest value near the peaks of the graphs. Annual mod-
ulation provides strong evince regarding the observation
of dark matter since the back ground does not exhibit
such modulation; see [11] for a recent review on annual
modulation measurements. As seen from Figs. 6 and 7,
23Na shows larger modulation compared to heavier nuclei
like 127I, 133Cs and 133Xe [10].

The event detection rates for these nuclei have been
calculated at a particular WIMP mass by reading out
the corresponding values of Dis from the Fig. 6 and
then evaluating Eq. (7) for a given set of supersymmetric
parameters. The event detection rates for diﬀerent values

23Na has 5/2+ excited state at 440 KeV above the

functions are given in Fig. (8). In the ﬁgures, F00, F01
and F11 are shown. The spin structure functions almost
vanish above u=4. With the value of u lying between 1
to 4, the spin structure functions diﬀer from each other.
The nuclear structure coeﬃcients En are shown in Fig.
9 for this nucleus. The inelastic nuclear structure coef-
ﬁcients do not depend on the detector threshold energy.
Hence the event rate can be calculated by reading the val-
ues of Ei from the graph and using the nucleonic current
parameters. The modulation for the inelastic scattering
case is much smaller than the elastic case.

V. RESULTS FOR WIMP-40AR ELASTIC
SCATTERING

The event rates for WIMP-40Ar elastic scattering are
calculated using the nuclear wave functions generated
through our DSM calculation. In our calculation, the ac-
tive spherical single particles orbitals are taken as 0d5/2,
0d3/2, 1s1/2, 0f7/2, 0f5/2, 1p3/2 and 1p1/2 with 16O as the
inert core. An eﬀective interaction named sdpf

and 6.479 MeV, respectively for the above seven orbitals
has been used. As discussed earlier, we ﬁrst generate the
lowest HF intrinsic state by solving the axially symmet-
ric HF equation self-consistently. Then, we generate the
excited conﬁgurations by particle-hole excitations. We
have considered a total of 9 intrinsic states. Good an-
gular momentum states are projected from each of these
intrinsic states and then a band mixing calculation is
performed. The band mixed wave functions deﬁned in

Eq. (16) are used in calculating the elastic event rates
and nuclear structure coeﬃcients for the ground state of
this nucleus. Note that the ground state is a 0+ state as
40Ar is a even-even nucleus and inelastic scattering from
ground needs excited 1+ state. However, the 1+ states
lie very high in energy and hence only elastic scattering
of WIMP from 40Ar is important. The oscillator length
parameter b for this nucleus is taken to be 1.725 f m.
We have presented the nuclear structure dependent coef-

8

ﬁcients deﬁned in Eq. (8) in Fig. 10 for this nucleus as a
function of the WIMP mass for diﬀerent values of the de-
tector threshold. Since 40Ar is a even-even nucleus, there
is no spin contribution from the ground state. Hence, we
have only D4, D5 and D6 corresponding to the proton,
neutron and proton-neutron form factors as deﬁned in
Eq. (7). Their values are slightly larger compared to the
corresponding quantities in 23Na but the modulation is
smaller. The peaks occur at around mχ = 35 GeV. How-
ever for larger values of Qthr, the peaks shift towards the
larger mχ. The event rates for WIMP-40Ar scattering
is plotted as a function of the dark matter mass in Fig.
(11) for Qthr = 0 and 10 keV. The event rates are cal-
culated using the same supersymmetric parameters as in
23Na. The values are smaller than in 23Na. This is be-
cause 40Ar is a even-even nucleus and hence there is no
spin contribution to the event rates in the ground state.
At Qthr = 0, the peak occurs at 35 GeV. For Qthr = 10
keV, the peak shifts to 45 GeV.

VI. CONCLUSION

Deformed shell model is used to calculate ﬁrst the event
rates for the elastic and inelastic scattering of WIMP
from 23Na. Spectroscopic properties of this nucleus are
calculated within DSM to check the suitability of the
model. We have also calculated magnetic moments for
the lowest level in this nucleus since spin plays an im-
portant role in the calculation of detection rates. Be-
fore 23Na analysis, we have compared the DSM results
also for 75As for further conﬁrmation of the goodness of
DSM for spectroscopy. After ensuring the good agree-
ment with experiment, we calculated the spin structure
functions, form factors, nuclear structure coeﬃcients and
the event rates for WIMP-23Na elastic and inelastic scat-
tering. In addition, event rates for elastic scattering of
WIMP from 40Ar are also presented. Results in Figs. 7
and 11 for event rates and in Figs. 6,7 and 9-11 for the
annual modulation should be useful for the upcoming and
future experiments detecting WIMP involving detectors
with 23Na and 40Ar. Let us add that the present study
using DSM for the nuclear structure part is in addition
to the results presented for WIMP scattering from 73Ge
in [38] and from 127I, 133Cs and 133Xe in [10]. Finally,
we hope that these and those obtained using other theo-
retical models for nuclear structure may guide the exper-
imentalists to unravel the fundamental mysteries of dark
matter particles.
