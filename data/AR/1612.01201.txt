Andreev bound states (ABSs) are well-deﬁned many-body quantum states that emerge from the
hybridization of individual quantum dot (QD) states with a superconductor and exhibit very rich
and fundamental phenomena. We demonstrate several new electron transport phenomena mediated
by ABSs that form on three-terminal carbon nanotube (CNT) QDs, with one superconducting (S)
contact in the center and two adjacent normal metal (N) contacts. Three-terminal spectroscopy
allows us to identify the coupling to the N contacts as the origin of the Andreev resonance (AR)
linewidths and to determine the critical coupling strengths to S, for which a ground state (or quan-
tum phase) transition in such S-QD systems can occur.
In addition, we ascribe replicas of the
lowest-energy ABS resonance to transitions between the ABS and odd-parity excited QD states,
a process we call excited state ABS resonances. In the conductance between the two N contacts
we ﬁnd a characteristic pattern of positive and negative diﬀerential subgap conductance, which we
explain by considering two nonlocal processes, the creation of Cooper pairs in S by electrons from
both N terminals, and a novel transport mechanism called resonant ABS tunneling, possible only
in multi-terminal QD devices. In the latter process, electrons are transferred via the ABS with-
out eﬀectively creating Cooper pairs in S. The three-terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy
experiments with diﬀerent boundary conditions, for example by leaving S ﬂoating. Surprisingly,
we ﬁnd that, depending on the boundary conditions and the device parameters, the experiments
either show single-particle Coulomb blockade resonances, ABS characteristics, or both in the same
measurements, seemingly contradicting the notion of ABSs replacing the single particle states as
eigenstates of the QD. We qualitatively explain these results as originating from the ﬁnite time scale
required for the coherent oscillations between the superposition states after a single electron tun-
neling event. These experiments demonstrate that three-terminal experiments on a single complex
quantum object can also be useful to investigate charge dynamics otherwise not accessible due to
the very high frequencies.

INTRODUCTION

Nanoscale electronic devices in contact with super-
conducting contacts (S) exhibit a large variety of fun-
damental physical phenomena and play, for example, a
central role in schemes for quantum computation.1,2 If
S is in contact with the many quantum channels of a
normal metal (N), phase-coherent Andreev reﬂections
lead to electron pairing and an induced superconduct-
ing gap in N. This proximity eﬀect has recently been
demonstrated also for one-dimensional semiconducting
nanowires,3 where strong spin-orbit interactions can give
rise to Majorana bound states.4–6 If S is strongly cou-
pled to a single channel quantum dot (QD), new sub-
gap eigenstates form, which are known as Andreev bound
states (ABS).7–10 ABSs carry the supercurrent in Joseph-
son junctions,11–18 and thus constitute a model system
to investigate the superconducting proximity eﬀect in
QDs.19 ABSs might also be exploited as Andreev quan-
tum bits20,21 and have recently attracted considerable
attention in both, theoretical19,22–30 and experimental
work.8–10,21,31–37

Previous experiments on ABSs were focused on QDs
with two contacts,8–10,31–35 and only few were possible
in multi-terminal devices.36,37 Three-terminal ABS de-
vices allow for new transport mechanisms, so that non-
local processes like Cooper pair splitting38–41 compete

with local mechanisms like Andreev tunneling.42 Such
mechanisms are expected to result in new eﬀects like the
triplet blockade26, characteristic patterns in the electri-
cal conductance,25,28 and other nonlocal eﬀects.29,30 In
addition, even the most basic ABS characteristics are ex-
pected to be determined by the barrier strengths, such as
the ABS resonance broadening9,35 and whether a quan-
tum phase transition in the S-QD many-body ground
state occurs as a function of the gate and bias voltages.
However, the coupling strengths can only be accessed un-
ambiguously in three terminal geometries.43–46

Here we report experiments on three-terminal QD de-
vices fabricated on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with one
central superconducting contact inducing ABSs on the
QD. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is
shown in Fig. 1. We investigate three devices with dif-
ferent coupling strengths ΓS to S to investigate several of
these open questions and demonstrate a series of new ef-
fects and measurement conﬁgurations. We use Pb as su-
perconductor, which results in a large energy gap ∆ and
thus in a high relative spectroscopic resolution,47 crucial
for our experiments. The paper is structured as follows:
In Sec. II we summarize our intuitive picture of ABSs
and ABS-mediated electron transport in two-terminal de-
vices. Sec. III describes the sample fabrication and mea-
surement setup. Then we characterize each of the investi-
gated devices by transport spectroscopy in Sec. IV, from
which we extract the tunnel coupling strengths to the
individual contacts and demonstrate that ΓS determines
the system ground state and ABS dispersion, while the
coupling strengths to the normal metal contacts, Γ1,2,
determine the spectroscopic width of the Andreev res-
onances (ARs).19,28 One device shows replicas of the
lowest-energy ABS resonance at higher energies, which
we ascribe to transitions to excited odd-parity QD states
in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we analyze the transport between
the two normal metal contacts mediated by ABSs, in
which competing local and nonlocal transport mecha-
nisms give rise to a characteristic pattern of positive and
negative diﬀerential conductance. These ﬁndings are well
captured by a simple rate equation model, which allows
us to identify Cooper pair splitting38,40 and a new three-
terminal subgap process we call resonant ABS tunnel-
ing. In Sec. VII we show that depending on the bound-
ary conditions imposed in the experiments, the measured
conductance either exhibits ABS or Coulomb blockade
characteristics, or both at the same time, which we ten-
tatively attribute to ﬁnite frequency coherent oscillations
between the single particle basis states when an ABS is
excited by single electron tunneling.

II. ABS MEDIATED TWO-TERMINAL
TRANSPORT

For illustration and to establish the terms used be-
low, we consider a QD with a single, spin-degenerate
level strongly tunnel coupled to a superconductor with
a strength ΓS, and weakly to a normal contact. The
former can couple even charge states of the isolated QD
by exchanging Cooper pairs to form new eigenstates of
the S-QD system. For ∆ → ∞ (superconducting atomic
limit), the emerging ABS can be written as a superpo-
sition of the even (empty and doubly occupied) charge
states of the isolated QD, i.e., as a singlet eigenstate
|−(cid:105) = u |0(cid:105) − v∗ |↑↓(cid:105), with u and v the gate-dependent
Bogoliubov- de Gennes (BdG) amplitudes and E− the
corresponding eigenenergy. The orthogonal eigenstate at
higher energies reads |+(cid:105) = v |0(cid:105) + u∗ |↑↓(cid:105). In contrast,

the odd charge states remain unperturbed doublets |σ(cid:105),
with σ = {↑, ↓} and energies Eσ.19,22–24,27 We note that
a similarly intuitive picture can be drawn in the limit of
small ∆, in which unpaired QD electrons can form Yu-
Shiba-Rusinov singlet states with quasi-particles in the
superconductor at energies below the gap and with trans-
port processes formally very similar to the ones discussed
below.48,49 Here we choose the large-∆ limit for the dis-
cussion because of its simple analytical expressions.

The low-energy excitation spectrum of the S-QD sys-
tem in the large-∆ limit is depicted schematically in
Figs. 2(a) and (b), for the case of the doublet being the
ground state (GS), and the ABS the excited state (ES).
Due to the diﬀerent parity of the doublet and the ABS,
one can directly probe the excitation spectrum by sin-
gle electron spectroscopy using a weakly coupled normal
metal tunnel probe (N) in an N-QD-S geometry.8,10,35,36
A current through such a device is only possible if the
bias matches the Andreev addition energy ζ = |E− −Eσ|,
i.e. if the electrochemical potential µN of N exceeds (lies
below) the excitation energy +ζ (−ζ) with respect to
the electrochemical potential in S, µS. As illustrated in
Figs. 2(a) and (b), charge is transported by an electron
tunneling from N into the |↑↓(cid:105) part of |−(cid:105), which excites
(E) the S-QD system from the GS |σ(cid:105) to the ES |−(cid:105). In
a two-terminal device, the system can relax (R) back to
the GS only by absorbing a second electron from N at
a negative energy −ζ tunneling into the |0(cid:105) part of |−(cid:105),
and the transfer of a Cooper pair to S. The probability of
this process cycle scales with u2v2.36 For a reversed bias,
a Cooper pair is removed from S. Since in this process

sulting subgap conductance features Andreev resonances
(ARs), which can be seen as a generalization of Andreev
reﬂection found in non-interacting systems.

The ARs show a characteristic gate and bias depen-
dence in the shape of ”loops” that directly reﬂect the
competition between superconducting pairing and the
Coulomb repulsion on the QD.19 While deep in the even
QD charge states the GS of the system is the singlet
|−(cid:105) (E− < Eσ), in the odd charge state the charging
energy U favors the doublet |σ(cid:105) as GS (Eσ < E−), in
competition with the pairing induced by ΓS. As illus-
trated for the limit ∆ → ∞ in Figs. 2(c)-(e), one ﬁnds
for small enough ΓS [Fig. 2(c)] a gate-tunable transition
from |−(cid:105) to |σ(cid:105) at gate voltages where the AR loops in-
tersect (ζ = 0). In contrast, for large ΓS the AR loops
do not intersect and the GS is always a singlet, as shown
in Fig. 2(e). In the large-gap limit ∆/ΓS → ∞ the crit-
ical parameter is ΓS/U with a GS transition occurring
for ΓS/U < 0.5,19,22–24,50,51 see Fig. 2(d). The limit for
a phase transition should be reduced for ﬁnite ∆ due to
a competition between the superconducting pairing and
the formation of a Kondo singlet with the quasi-particles
at ∆.23,24 In the strong-coupling limit with ∆/ΓS (cid:46) 0.5
theoretical results suggest the following relation for a GS
transition to occur:

C ≈ 0.73 in Ref. 23 (values corrected for diﬀerent
deﬁnitions of TK). In the normal state we expect that
the Kondo temperature, TK,
is obtained by replacing
ΓS by the total coupling Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 + ΓS, where we
already included the coupling to a third normal metal
terminal. Though not experimentally demonstrated,
yet, our intuitive picture suggests that the spectroscopic
width of an AR line in the superconducting state at
a bias eV (cid:28) ∆ is determined by the life-time of the
excited state and thus by the ﬁnite coupling strength of
the QD to all normal terminals, ΓN = Γ1 + Γ2, see also
Refs. 9,28.

SEM image of a typical device is shown in Fig. 1, which
also illustrates our measurement setup: a dc voltage, VS,
with a superimposed ac modulation of δVAC = 10 µV
is applied to S, while measuring the variations δI1,2 in
the currents I1,2 through the normal terminals N1 and
N2 using standard lock-in techniques, which results in
the diﬀerential conductances G1,2 = δI1,2/δVAC. In ad-
dition, we can set the potentials on N1 and N2 by the
voltages V1 and V2, respectively (not shown), or leave
them ﬂoating individually by the switches Sw1(2) outside
the cryostat. Similarly, we can also apply the bias to N1
while measuring the current variations in S and N2, or
leaving S ﬂoating. All measurements were performed in
a dilution refrigerator at a base temperature of ∼ 35 mK.
We discuss three CNT devices A, B and C, each ex-
hibiting subgap ARs. In device A, the Pd wetting layer
was 4.5 nm thick, while in the devices B and C it was
6 nm. The room temperature resistances between an N
terminal and S were ∼ 30−40 kΩ (sample A) and ∼ 20 kΩ
(samples B and C).

S-QD GROUND STATE AND LIFE TIMES

In this section we investigate ABS mediated transport
between N and S terminals in the three devices and take
full advantage of the three-terminal geometry. Primarily,
we focus on extracting the superconducting energy gap
∆, the charging energy U and the individual tunnel cou-
pling strengths of the three contacts to the QD and and
on relating them to the observed AR resonance patterns
and the AR broadening. The relevant data for device
A are shown in Fig. 3, device B in Fig. 4 and device C
in Fig. 5 and will be discussed in the following subsec-
tions. In all ﬁgures we plot the diﬀerential conductances
G1 (left, a and c) and G2 (right, b and d) as a function of
a gate voltage and the bias applied to S, VS, while keep-
ing V1 = V2 = 0 and VBG = 0. The top panels (a and
b) show the data for S in the normal state obtained by
applying a magnetic ﬁeld of B = 0.4 T perpendicular to
the substrate, and the bottom panels (c and d) the mea-
surements with S in the superconducting state at B = 0.
The relevant extracted and derived device parameters are
summarized in Table I.

III. DEVICE FABRICATION AND
MEASURMENT SETUP

We have fabricated CNT three-terminal devices with
a lead (Pb) based central ∼ 200 nm wide Pd/Pb/In
(4.5 − 6/110/20 nm) S contact,47 two Pd N contacts and
two sidegates (SGs) using close to residue free electron
beam lithography.54 The typical critical perpendicular
ﬁeld for these S contacts is ∼ 200 mT and we apply
400 mT for our normal state experiments. The highly p-
doped Si/SiO2 substrate serves as a backgate (BG). An

In App. A we demonstrate in detail that the transport
between all three terminals of device A is governed by
a single QD. This is also evident in Figs. 3(a-b), which
show the same Coulomb blockade (CB) diamond pattern
(dashed lines) in G1 and G2 as a function of the bias and
the voltage VSG1+2 = VSG1 = VSG2 applied to both SGs,
with an even-odd shell-ﬁlling sequence in both simultane-
ously recorded conductance maps. In the odd diamonds
we ﬁnd horizontal conductance ridges (K, white arrows)
due to Zeeman-split Kondo resonances.55,56 For increas-

4

ﬁnd the same conductance features (though of diﬀering
amplitudes) in G1 and G2. We discuss the higher energy
replicas of the low energy AR pointed out by yellow and
orange arrows in Figs. 3(c-d) in Sec. V. The subgap fea-
tures are fully consistent with ARs: for even spin states
(no Kondo ridge in the normal state) we observe large
loops, while for odd occupation the loops are smaller and
intersect inside the normal state CB diamonds. This dis-
persion is characteristic for ARs with a relatively small
coupling to S. For example, comparing the extracted sys-
tem parameters for resonance 2 results in ∆/ΓS ≈ 5.5, i.e.
the large-∆ limit, in which ΓS/U ≈ 0.07 (cid:28) 0.5 suggests
a gate tunable GS transition, consistent with the loop
structure observed in the experiments. We note that also
the strong-coupling expression predicts a GS transition,
kBTKS/∆ ≈ 1.7 × 10−3 (cid:28) C for all C in the literature.
Similar results for the other resonances are summarized
in Tab. I and are also consistent with the observed loop
structures.

The full width at half the maximum (FWHM) of the
three ARs in this device is ∼ 50 − 70 µeV, much smaller
than the total coupling strength Γ ∼ 0.2 meV (see Fig. 13
in Appendix A), but consistent with the coupling ΓN ≈
50 µeV to the two normal leads. This demonstrates that
ΓN = Γ1 + Γ2 fully accounts for the ABS excitation life
time, as expected for ΓN (cid:28) ∆, which holds for all devices
investigated here.

B. Device B

In device B a single QD is formed mainly between
S and N1, while the CNT segment between S and N2
shows an essentially gate independent conductance in
an open regime and can be viewed as a contact to the
QD. This is shown in more detail in App. A. In Fig. 4
we therefore plot G1 and G2 as a function of VS and
VSG1 to keep the other side unperturbed.
In the nor-
mal state of S, G1 in Fig. 4(a) exhibits a pattern typical
for a QD strongly coupled to the leads, with an even-
odd ﬁlling that can still be deduced from cotunneling
lines. The CB diamonds are outlined by dashed lines.
In contrast, G2 plotted in Fig. 4(b) shows only a small
conductance modulation, as expected for highly trans-
parent barriers. In G1 we ﬁnd Kondo ridges in the odd
charge states (K, arrows), which are strongly broadened
so that the Zeeman splitting cannot be resolved. The
horizontal lines at VS ∼ ±0.2 mV in the middle of the
conductance map (yellow arrows) do not agree with the
expected Zeeman splitting of a (spin) Kondo resonance
and g = 2 and are probably due to inelastic cotunnel-
ing, or due to the valley Kondo eﬀect.60 From the charge
stability diagram in Fig. 4(a) we estimate a leverarm of
αSG1 ≈ 0.05, a charging energy of U ≈ 3.0 meV, and a
level spacing of ∼ 2.5 meV, consistent with a QD smaller
than in device A and located between S and N1. Due to
the pronounced Kondo resonances and the strong cou-
pling to the leads, it is diﬃcult to extract the tunnel

ing magnetic ﬁelds (not shown), we observe a Zeeman-
splitting of these ridges with a g-factor of g ≈ 2.1. Using
additional measurement conﬁgurations,44 e.g. with the
bias applied to an N terminal, we ﬁnd that the Kondo res-
onance solely originates from the S contact (not shown)
We ﬁrst analyze the normal state data in Figs. 3(a)
and (b). From the CB resonances we deduce a lever-
arm αSG1+2 ≈ 0.01 of the combined sidegates, a charg-
ing energy of U ≈ 2.5 meV, and from excited state and
inelastic cotunneling lines the lowest two orbital energies
∼ 0.3 meV and ∼ 0.5 meV. The three-terminal geometry
allows one to determine the coupling strengths Γi of the
individual contacts to the QD by ﬁtting a Breit-Wigner
lineshape57 to diﬀerent two-terminal conductances.43
This procedure is explained in more detail in App. A.
From these ﬁts, we obtain Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 + ΓS = 204 µeV,
ΓS = 150 µeV, Γ1 = 1 µeV and Γ2 = 53 µeV and thus
ΓN = Γ1 + Γ2 = 54 µeV for resonance 1 in Fig. 3(a).
For resonance 2 we obtain Γ = 220 µeV, ΓS = 173 µeV,
Γ1 = 1 µeV and Γ2 = 46 µeV and thus ΓN = 47 µeV, and
for resonance 3 Γ = 151 µeV, ΓS = 118 µeV, Γ1 = 3 µeV
and Γ2 = 30 µeV, so that ΓN = 33 µeV. We note that
generally ΓS (cid:29) ΓN. We estimate the Kondo tempera-

tent with a suppression of the GS transition. We note
that with ∆/ΓK2
S ≈ 0.5 the large-∆ limit would predict
touching AR loops, on the boundary of the phase tran-
sition, in contradiction to the experiment. Qualitatively,
the larger coupling of the K2 state results in the suppres-
sion of the GS transition, whereas a transition is expected
for K1.

C. Device C

In contrast to the devices A and B, device C shows
clear characteristics of a double QD with strong inter-
dot coupling (see App. A for details). By only varying
sidegate 1 and keeping VSG2 = 0, we mostly tune QD1
between N1 and S, while the conductance through QD2
between N2 and S is varied only around the maximum
of a QD resonance (App. A). For this reason QD2 can
essentially be seen as a contact to QD1. Figures 5(a-b)
show G1 and G2 as a function of VS and VSG1 for S in the
normal state, with strong cotunneling lines and Kondo
resonances in the odd charge states (K1 and K2). From
the charge stability diagram interpolated in Fig. 5(a) we
estimate a leverarm of SG1 to QD1 of αSG1 ≈ 0.01, a
charging energy of U ≈ 2.4 meV and a level spacing of
∼ 1.3 meV for QD1. Similar as for device B, we estimate
Γ from the HWHM of the Kondo resonance and obtain
kBTK1 ≈ 0.3 meV (TK1 ≈ 3.5 K) and ΓK1 ≈ 0.8 meV for

coupling constants directly. We therefore estimate the
coupling strength Γ from the half-width at half maxi-
mum (HWHM) of the Kondo ridges K1 and K2.8,32,61 We
obtain kBTK1 ≈ 0.24 meV (TK1 ≈ 2.8 K) for K1, and es-

timate ΓK1 ≈ 0.8 meV from kBTK ≈
Similarly, for K2 we ﬁnd kBTK2 ≈ 0.8 meV (TK2 ≈ 9.3 K)
and ΓK2 ≈ 1.7 meV. These values are consistent with the
CB resonance width at ﬁnite bias and show that the Zee-
man splitting of the Kondo resonance can be neglected
in this estimate.

G1 and G2 for S in the superconducting state are plot-
ted in Figure 4(c-d), where we ﬁnd pronounced ARs in
G1 for bias voltages VS below the superconducting trans-
port gap, ∆ ≈ 0.65 meV. A weak modulation at the same
voltages can also be found in G2. The AR loop in the left-
most odd state (K1 in the normal state) is considerably
smaller than the loops in device A, and the right-most
AR loop (K2 in the normal state) does not exhibit a GS
transition at all. The AR between K1 and K2 (arrow)
exhibits two resonances related to QD excited states and
consistent with normal state cotunneling lines, as dis-
cussed in more detail in Sec. V.

We now use the AR linewidth to estimate the remain-
ing tunneling parameters. Equating the AR linewidths
with ΓN = Γ1 +Γ2 as established for device A, we ﬁnd for
resonance K1 ΓK1

coupling limit. However, both expressions still correctly

of the lowest excited states in the normal state measure-
ments of this device. We ﬁnd no such replicas for de-
vice C, for which the orbital energies are larger than the
superconducting gap, δE > ∆. We note that the repli-
cas are not consistent with inelastic Andreev tunneling,42
because they show a clear gate dependence following the
lowest AR, we ﬁnd no negative diﬀerential conductance
between the resonances, and they are broadened with in-
creasing temperature.
In the following, we exploit the
third QD terminal to show that the replicas are caused
by ABS mediated transport via excited states of the dou-
blet |σ(cid:105) in the odd QD state, a process we call excited
state ARs.

To experimentally identify the origin of these replicas,
we performed conductance measurements in a conﬁgu-
ration diﬀerent to the one in Sec. IV. Here we keep the
dc parts V1 = VS = 0 and apply the dc bias V2 to N2,
while modulating VS by the ac voltage δVAC (see also
Fig. 1 for orientation). We again deﬁne the conductances
G1,2 = δI1,2/dVAC from the current modulations in the
normal terminals 1 and 2. Figure 6 shows G1 and G2 as a
function of VSG1+2 and V2. Intuitively, one might expect
that G1 is independent of V2, which is the case for local
processes when neglecting gating eﬀects by V2. Surpris-
ingly, we ﬁnd both, ABS mediated (‘curved lines’) and
standard QD resonances (‘straight lines’) in these data
sets. In the picture of ∆ → ∞ this is not trivial and we
will discuss this ﬁnding in more detail in Sec. VII.

Here, we exploit that the width of both types of trans-

the resonance K1. For resonance K2 we ﬁnd kBTK2 ≈
0.35 meV (TK2 ≈ 4 K) and ΓK2 ≈ 0.88 meV.

For S in the superconducting state, G1 and G2 plotted
in Figs. 5(c-d) both show pronounced ARs. In contrast to
the previous devices, we ﬁnd two horizontal conductance
maxima, one at ∆1 ≈ 0.42 meV most prominent in G1,
and ∆2 ≈ 0.75 meV more clearly visible in G2, which
we tentatively interpret as two superconducting trans-
port gaps in the individual CNT arms. Surprisingly, the
ABS loops connect smoothly, but the right-most loops
are bounded by ∆1, while the left-most clearly reaches
up to ∆2. Currently we do not have a good explanation
for these ﬁndings, but speculate that the QD wave func-
tion might be coupled inhomogeneously to S, e.g. at two
separate places with two distinct eﬀective coupling con-
stants. For the present investigation the relevant ﬁndings
are that the ABS loops exactly touch for the K1 state and
that for K2 the loops are slightly separated in energy, i.e.
that the K1 parameters correspond to the critical values
of the ABS phase transition and that the GS transition
is suppressed for K2.

KS ≈ 0.60 for K1 and ∆1/ΓK2

The latter observations compare well to the extracted
tunnel couplings: For device C, we ﬁnd an AR line width
of ΓN ≈ 0.1 meV for both resonances and estimate ΓK1
S ≈
0.7 meV at the position of the Kondo resonance K1 and
ΓK2
S ∼ 0.78 meV for K2. Using ∆1 as the relevant energy
gap, we ﬁnd ∆1/ΓK1
KS ≈ 0.54
for K2, both in a range for which it is acceptable to use
Eqn. (1). The latter results in kBTKS1/∆1 ≈ 0.57 for K1,
consistent with a ‘touching’ of the AR loops if C ≈ 0.6 in
Eq. (1), and kBTKS2/∆1 ≈ 0.69 for K2, suggesting a close
but avoided AR loop crossing and no GS transition. We
note that the ratios used for the large-∆ limit, ΓK1
S /U ≈
0.29 for K1 and ΓK2
S /U ≈ 0.33 for K2, would wrongly
predict a GS transition for both charge states.

The results of this section are collected in Table I and
compared to the AR loop structures found in the exper-
iments. Our experiments clearly suggest a GS transition
limit of C ≈ 0.6 when using Eq. (1). In addition, we ﬁnd
that the AR broadening is consistent with the coupling
to both normal contacts.

V. EXCITED STATE ANDREEV RESONANCES

In Sec. IV we found multiple replicas at higher energies
for all ARs in device A and one replica in the central AR
of device B. The spacings of ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 and ∼ 0.5 meV
between these replicas are very similar to the spacings

to close the charge transport cycle. Therefore we expect
for these gate voltages only one resonance at eVS = ζ,
but with an increased amplitude, because the additional
transport channel via |σ∗(cid:105) is allowed for eVS ≥ ζ.

VI. ABS MEDIATED TRANSPORT BETWEEN
TWO N CONTACTS

In three-terminal QD devices, one can expect novel
subgap transport mechanisms due to “non-local” trans-
port processes that require two N and one S terminal,
and their interplay with local eﬀects involving only two
terminals.25,28 In particular, transport between two N
contacts can be mediated by ABSs.28 To perform this
type of experiments, we use a diﬀerent measurement con-
ﬁguration than in the previous sections, with the AC bias
δVAC and the dc bias V1 applied to N1, while measuring
the current variation δI2 in N2. This can be done while
also recording the current variation IS in S at a ﬁxed po-
tential VS, or while leaving S ﬂoating (see Sec. VII). We
again deﬁne the diﬀerential conductances Gi = δIi/δVAC.
In Fig. 8(a-b) we plot GS and G2 of device B as a func-
tion of V1 and the gate voltage VSG1, with VS = 0. In ad-
dition to the typical AR pattern in GS already discussed
for Fig. 4, we ﬁnd in G2 pronounced resonances at the
same gate and bias voltages. This illustrates again that
N2 is a third terminal to the QD with ABSs. In contrast
to the ARs in GS, the AR amplitudes in G2 show pro-
nounced sign changes, from positive to negative diﬀeren-
tial conductance with similar magnitudes ∼ ±0.1×2e2/h
at positions symmetric around the electron-hole (e-h)
symmetry points. The sign is inverted at the e-h sym-

port resonances between N1 and N2 is determined by
Γ1 + Γ2 only, and not by Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 + ΓS as in the
normal state (see Sec. IV). This allows us to resolve also
excited state resonances between the two N contacts. In
Fig. 6 we ﬁnd both, straight lines (labeled by white ar-
rows) and AR with a curved dispersion (orange arrows),
best visible in G2. The straight excited state resonances
have a similar spacing as the corresponding excited state
ARs and sometimes even originate from the same posi-
tion in these plots.

Excited state ARs can be understood on the same foot-
ing as the GS ARs in the ∆ → ∞-limit (Sec. II). In ad-
dition to the odd-electron ground state |σ(cid:105) we also con-
sider the corresponding excited state |σ∗(cid:105), separated in
energy by δE. As depicted in Fig. 7(a) for |−(cid:105) being
the GS, the system can now also be excited to |σ∗(cid:105) (blue
arrows) in addition to |σ(cid:105) (red arrows). The correspond-
ing transition energies ζ ∗ (blue lines) and ζ (red lines)
are plotted in Fig. 7(c). ζ ∗ replicates the shape of ζ at
higher energies, as observed in the experiments. We call
the resonances ζ ∗ excited state Andreev resonances, be-
cause they correspond to a ﬁrst order transition between
an ABS and an excited odd-electron state. This situation
of |−(cid:105) being the GS results in the excited state AR high-
lighted by yellow arrows in the experiments of Fig. 3(c-d).
Also consistent with the experiment is that the expected
ζ ∗ line ends at the intersection with ζ in Fig. 7(b), best
visible in the central resonance of Fig. 4(c). This can
be understood qualitatively by introducing a (fast) en-
ergy relaxation from |σ∗(cid:105) to |σ(cid:105), which we call ”thermal
relaxation” (TR) to distinguish it from the parity chang-
ing relaxation by single electron tunneling. If |−(cid:105) is the
GS this results only in a second relaxation channel from
|σ∗(cid:105) to the GS, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). However, if |σ(cid:105)
is the GS and |−(cid:105) lies energetically midway between σ∗
and σ or higher, as shown in Fig. 7(b), σ∗ can be excited
by single electrons at ζ ∗, but the system relaxes fast to
|σ(cid:105), from where the energy ζ > ζ ∗ is required to reach |−(cid:105)

for a reversed bias. This is best visible in the regions R1
and R2 marked by rectangles in Fig. 8(b). The central
GS transition deviates from this description, most likely
due to the overlapping second AR (see Sec. IV), but also
exhibits systematic sign changes. For the devices A and
C we ﬁnd similar characteristics as for device B. As an
example, we plot GS and G2 of device C in Fig. 8(c-d),
where we added a DC bias VS = +0.4 mV to S. This bias
results in an oﬀset of the features in GS and G2, where
we again ﬁnd the characteristic sign changes in G2, la-
beled by white arrows in Fig. 8(d), identical to region R2
in Fig. 8(b). From these and a series of other measure-
ments with diﬀerent VS we conclude that the sign changes
are robust against VS and that all measurements can be
understood considering potentials relative to the one on
S.

A. Rate equation model

To describe the transport through an S-QD system, we
introduce a rate equation model similar to Ref. 36, using
the ∆ → ∞ limit to describe the ABSs and the doublet
states, as shown in Fig. 9(a). The excitation and relax-
ation rates depend on the transport processes, illustrated
in Fig. 9(b). In contrast to the two-terminal case, we now
consider a coupling to a third normal metal terminal N2
with a strength Γ2, in addition to the terminal S (ΓS) and
N1 (Γ1). For E < ∆ we need to consider only transport
mediated by the ABS. The bias V1 is applied to N1 as in
the experiment, while S and N2 are kept at µS = µ2 = 0.
The excitation and relaxation rates, te and tr, denote
the total rates by which the system is changed from the
GS to the excited state (ES) and back, and will be deter-
mined below. The steady state occupation probabilities
PGS and PES = 1 − PGS of the GS and ES are then found
by setting

d
dt

PES = tePGS − trPES = 0,

(2)

which yields PGS = tr/(tr + te) and PES = te/(tr + te).

The rates te and tr contain all excitation and relaxation
processes, which can be viewed in the simpliﬁed picture
of sequential individual tunneling events, as illustrated in
Fig. 9(b). In the corresponding rates we use the super-
script 1(2) to denote the contacts N1 (N2) and +(−) to
state whether an electron is added (removed) from the
S-QD system. The excitation and relaxation rates can
then be calculated using Fermi’s Golden Rule.27,36,63 For
example, if |σ(cid:105) is the GS and |−(cid:105) the ES, see Fig. 9(c-d),
the rate t1+
for the excitation by an electron tunneling

For the singlet |−(cid:105) being the GS, all rates can be obtained

and IS = −(I1 + I2). The diﬀerential conductance mea-
sured at contact i = {1, 2, S} can then be obtained as
Gi = dIi/dV1 for the experiments described in this sec-
tion.

An example of such a calculation is shown in Fig. 10
for parameters that result in the familiar ABS loop struc-
ture and positive conductance values in the two-terminal
local conductance GS. This is plotted in Fig. 10(b) as a
function of V1 and the normalized gate-tunable QD or-
bital energy ε0/U and corresponds, for example, to the
resonances in the left-most region in Fig. 8(a). More im-
portantly, Fig. 10(c) shows G2 for the same parameter
range, which should be compared to the left-most region
R1 in Fig. 8(b). We ﬁnd that the model at least quali-
tatively reproduces the experimental ﬁndings, with sign
changes at the e-h symmetry point (ε0/U = −0.5) and
for a reversed bias, and clearly highlighting the GS tran-

9

sition. Similarly, for large ΓS and |−(cid:105) being the GS for
all gate voltages, we ﬁnd sign changes only at the e-h
symmetry point, consistent with the resonances in the
right-most region R2 in Figs. 8(b) and (d). The corre-
sponding plots are shown in Appendix B in Fig. 16. In
addition, the sign changes in the model are independent
of the applied voltages VS or V2, as in the experiment.

Due to the Fermi functions, the only non-vanishing
rates at low temperatures are t1+
for
a forward bias µ1 > µS > µ2, as depicted in Fig.9. For
example, the local Andreev processes between N1 and S
scale with t1+
. More interestingly, the sign changes in
G2 are caused by the competition between processes com-
prising the two relaxation processes t2−
, which
remove or add an electron from the system at diﬀerent
energies, respectively. In this case the current in N2 is
proportional to the diﬀerence between the BdG ampli-
tudes, I2 ∝ (u2 − v2), with a sign change at the GS
transition (transition from u2 > v2 to u2 < v2), or for a
reversed bias V1. The conductance G2 thus reﬂects di-
rectly the gradual charging of the ABS with decreasing
gate voltage, which evolves from an excess charge of 0 in
the n = 0 state to an average charge of 2e in the n = 2
state. In a more coherent picture the process combining
an electron tunneling into the system from both, N1 and
N2, (t1+
r ) corresponds to the ‘nonlo-
cal’ creation of a Cooper pair in S, often called (inverse)
Cooper pair splitting (CPS). Similarly, the coherent tun-
neling into and out of the system at the same energy (t1+
combined with t2−
r ) corresponds to the direct transfer of
one electron from N1 to N2, mediated by the ABS. This
new process we call ‘resonant ABS tunneling’. These
‘nonlocal’ transport processes involve all three terminals
and are illustrated in Fig. 10(d). For these processes
we expect the rates tiCPS ∝ t1+
for inverse CPS and
trABSt ∝ t1+
for resonant ABS tunneling. This inter-
pretation is also supported by recent more fundamental
calculations,25,28 all in good agreement with our exper-
iments and the simple model. We point out that to ac-
count for the similar magnitudes of the positive and neg-
ative diﬀerential conductance in G2, it is necessary that
CPS and resonant ABS tunneling are of similar strength.

VII. COHERENT OSCILLATIONS IN THE ABS

In this section we present and compare measurements
with diﬀerent boundary conditions imposed to the QD
terminals. For example, Figs 11(a-c) show the diﬀerential
conductance G between the two normal metal contacts
(see also in the previous section) with the superconductor
S left ﬂoating. The data for the devices A, C and B,
are plotted as a function of the bias and gate voltage
in the same gate voltage intervals as discussed in the
previous sections. The data sets are ordered according
to increasing ΓS, as found in Sec. IV. Such experiments
are equivalent to Ref. 37, where ABSs in a proximitized
S-QD InAs nanowire were investigated in the context of

Majorana bound states.

For device A, with a weak coupling to S and a small
ΓS/U ratio, we ﬁnd CB diamonds very similar to the nor-
mal state. Speciﬁcally, there are no ARs, nor a suppres-
sion of G related to a superconducting gap. ARs were,
however, clearly observed when the superconductor was
grounded (see Fig. 3), and both types of resonances were
found in the experiments of Fig. 6. In contrast, devices
C and B, both with a larger coupling to S, show clear
signatures of ARs and the energy gap. However, in these
experiments no sign changes in G occur and we observe
only positive diﬀerential conductance features, in stark
contrast to S being on a ﬁxed potential (Fig. 8). For
device B, this experiment results in essentially the same
AR gate and bias dispersion as when measured between
an N and the S contact (Fig. 4), whereas for device C
we ﬁnd additional curved resonances at higher energies
(cf. Fig. 5). We note that the ARs are centered around
zero bias, which suggests that µS either follows µN1 or
µN2 due to the diﬀerent coupling strenghts to the normal
metal terminals.

The experiments on devices B and C are straight for-
ward to understand qualitatively based on our previous
picture of ABSs: we assumed that the CNT segment be-
tween N1 and N2 forms a QD in the normal state of S.
In the superconducting state, the eigenstates of the seg-
ment are ABSs that determine all subgap transport. If
S is at a ﬁxed potential, it can take up (or emit) Cooper
pairs, which allows Cooper pair splitting as a process
and, in unison with resonant ABS tunneling, results in
the pattern of positive and negative diﬀerential conduc-
tance. If S is ﬂoating, the experiments show that µS is
ﬁxed, and since CPS and the local Andreev processes
both add charges to S, which would change the electri-
cal (though not the chemical) potential of S, these pro-
cesses exactly compensate to satisfy the boundary condi-
tion IS = 0. This leaves only resonant ABS tunneling as
a subgap transport process between N1 and N2, which
does not change the charge on S and results in a positive

G, mapping out the ABS excitation energy. Additional
features and diﬀerent amplitudes compared to the tradi-
tional ARs are to be expected, since here only electrons
at one energy are involved and we expect that the bal-
ance between the processes that change the charge on S
depend on the bias.

The interpretation of the experiments on device A is
less obvious. We ﬁnd in the conductance between N1
and N2 the standard QD resonances when S is ﬂoating,
while if S is at a ﬁxed potential modulated by the ac
voltage, ABS signatures occur simultaneously with the
standard QD features, see Fig. 6 in Sec. V. In the two-
terminal measurements between N and S, we only ﬁnd
ABS related signals. These experiments seem quite con-
tradictory, since one would expect that the eigenstates of
the S-QD system do not depend on the boundary con-
ditions of the measurement. As discussed for samples
B and C, the diﬀerent processes are combined to satisfy
the diﬀerent boundary conditions, but the simultaneous
observation of standard Coulomb blockade and ABS fea-
tures cannot be resolved with such arguments alone.

This suggests that our picture of ABS mediated trans-
port is not complete and only holds for a strong enough
coupling to S. In this picture we assume that the QD
develops new eigenstates due to the coupling to the un-
perturbed superconductor and one might expect that a
continuous lowering of the coupling strengths results in
a continuous transition from the ABS to the bare QD
states. In contrast, our results seem to suggest that in
some parameter regime both sets of states are available
for diﬀerent transport processes.

We speculate that for low enough ΓS the tunneling of
an electron on and oﬀ the QD from an N terminal is
faster than the exchange of Cooper pairs with S, which
is necessary for the hybridization of the QD with S.
Right after the ﬁrst tunneling event the system is in the
state |↑↓(cid:105), which is a coherent superposition of the sys-
tem eigenstates |−(cid:105) and |+(cid:105), i.e., |↑↓(cid:105) = −v |−(cid:105) + u |+(cid:105)
(|0(cid:105) = u∗ |−(cid:105) + v∗ |+(cid:105)). Therefore we expect coherent os-

electron tunneling events, with a characteristic frequency
essentially determined by ΓS. This oscillation is expected
to result in a suppression of the waiting time distribution
for short times,64 and might be responsible for our ﬁnd-
ings here:
in a three-terminal device an excitation can-
not only be absorbed by forming a Cooper pair, as in a
two-terminal device, but also by tunneling out into the
third terminal (resonant ABS tunneling). If this happens
faster than half a coherent oscillation, the tunneling elec-
tron stays in the bare QD state during the time it resides
on the CNT segment. Assuming that an oscillation by
half a period is required to transfer a Cooper pair to S,
we ﬁnd the relation ΓN2 > ΓS/π as a necessary condition
to observe the bare QD resonances, in good agreement
with device A, but not for the other two devices with con-
siderably larger ΓS and a faster oscillation rate relative
to ΓN2. Our results demonstrate that a three-terminal
QD can give access to the fast electron dynamics, in our
example of the ABS coherent oscillations with frequen-
cies ΓS/h in the range between ∼ 30 GHz (device A) to
∼ 370 GHz (device B), by the implicit comparison to the
tunnel rate to the third terminal.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we investigate electronic transport me-
diated by Andreev bound states in a three-terminal S-
QD device and identify the coupling to the normal metal
leads as the main source for the spectroscopic broadening
of the Andreev resonances, and establish how the cou-
pling to the superconductor determines the ground state
of the system. In addition, we present ‘excited state An-
dreev resonances’ at higher energies, with transitions be-
tween ABSs and odd parity excited QD states. We also
report pronounced sign changes in the ABS-mediated
transport between the two normal metal contacts, which
we explain in an intuitive rate equation model as result-
ing from the competition between the nonlocal creation
of a Cooper pair in S and a new process we call ‘resonant
ABS tunneling’, i.e., the subgap transport of single elec-
trons through the S-QD system, only allowed in multi-
terminal devices. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that depending
on the imposed boundary conditions in the experiments
it is possible to observe either ABSs or Coulomb block-
ade resonances, or both in the same experiment, which
we tentatively attribute to the competition between co-
herent oscillations in the ABS (exchange of Cooper pairs
with S) and the relaxation of the system by single elec-
tron tunneling into the second normal terminal.

We believe that experiments on complex quantum sys-
tems using multiple terminals provide a novel and clear
experimental probe for many old and new phenomena,
here for example the onset of the superconducting prox-
imity eﬀect on a QD and the formation of many-body
quantum states. Such experiments also give direct ac-
cess to the strength of the coupling between S and the

11

QD, and a way to probe time dependent phenomena like
the ﬁnite-frequency coherent oscillation between super-
position states, without resorting to high-frequency and
time domain experiments. In particular, we envisage ex-
periments in similar structures with gate-tunable tunnel
barriers65 to investigate in more depths the presented
physical mechanisms.

Appendix A: Additional data for device A, B and C

In this appendix we analyze additional data of devices
A, B and C. In particular, we discuss the electronic con-
ﬁguration of each device, using conductance maps as a
function of both sidegate voltages.

1. Device A

Figures 12(a) and (b) show the measured diﬀerential
conductance G1 and G2 of device A as a function of the
sidegate voltages VSG1 and VSG2, for the ac bias applied
to S, but with VS = VBG = 0, and in the normal state of
the device at B = 0.3 T. These data are consistent with a
single QD66–68, for example because we observe the same
resonance lines in both, N1 and N2, and when we apply
the ac bias to S. In addition, we ﬁnd one dominant slope
of the CB resonances that react similarly to both side-
gates. There are only vague hints at a more complex con-
ﬁnement potential, possibly due to disorder or potential
ﬂuctuations on the substrate, e.g. a slight conductance
modulation with some features stronger (weaker) in one
(the other) arm, and slight changes in the slopes or the
spacing between neighboring resonances. The electronic
conﬁguration we qualitatively deduce from these ﬁndings
is sketched in the inset of Fig. 12(a). In particular, in the
region studied in the main text, marked by an orange
line in Fig. 12(b), the assumption of a single QD is jus-
tiﬁed. In Fig. 12(c), we plot the diﬀerential conductance
in the normal state of S along the yellow dashed line of
Fig. 12(b), as a function of the VS and one sidegate volt-
age only. Here, we also clearly observe the same diamond
structure in both arms of the device, further supporting
this claim.

Next, we brieﬂy demonstrate the ﬁtting procedure to
determine the individual Γi of the contacts. In Fig. 13,
the simultaneously measured zero-bias conductance G1 ≡
G1S and G2 ≡ G2S of resonance 1 (main text) is plotted

agree very well with the data, and yield Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 +
ΓS ≈ 205 µeV, ΓSΓ1 ≈ 198 µeV2 and ΓSΓ2 ≈ 7945 µeV2.
From these equations, all parameters are determined for
ΓS > Γ1, Γ2. This assumption can be directly justiﬁed
from a similar analysis of measurements with the bias
applied to N1, while measuring GS ≡ GS1 and G2 ≡ G21
(not shown). In addition, we show in Fig. 13(c) the zero-
bias cross section of resonance 1 at B = 0, i.e. for S being
superconducting. As described in more detail before,42
the resonance is more narrow and better described by
resonant Andreev tunneling (RAT). However, the expres-
sion used in Fig. 13(c)42 is meant for two-terminal de-
vices, and accordingly the extracted parameters do not
correspond in an obvious way to the ones in the normal
state.

2. Device B

Figure 14(a) and (b) show G1 and G2 of device B as
a function of the sidegate voltages VSG1 and VSG2, for

the ac bias applied to S, but with VS = VBG = 0, and
in the normal state of the device at B = 0.4 T. In the
conductance map of G1, we observe a single dominant
slope which is tuned mostly with VSG1, suggesting a QD
located between S and N1.
In contrast, G2 plotted in
Fig. 14(b) shows a very high conductance with a weak
and slow amplitude variation as function of VSG2, char-
acteristic for a more open CNT regime with highly trans-
missive contacts.
In particular, G2 never approaches
zero. Imprints of the resonances from G1 can be observed
in G2, which we ascribe to resistive and capacitive cross-
talk.38,40 Hence, we assume an electronic conﬁguration
of the CNT device as schemtically depicted in the inset
of Fig. 14(b), with a larger QD on the left side of the
device mostly tunable by VSG1, and an ‘open’ CNT lead
to the right.

pronounced Kondo ridges. In particular, the broad res-
onances in Fig. 15(a) which we ascribe to QD1 indicate
an odd charge state with a Kondo ridge. This is more
obvious when one closely inspects the region indicated
by a dashed rectangle in Fig. 15(a) in the superconduct-
ing state of S, which is plotted in Fig. 15(c). Here, one
observes a pair of Andreev resonance lines in the even
charge state of QD2 (yellow arrow), corresponding to
the two singlet-doublet GS transitions observed in the
odd charge states of QD1. These GS transitions van-
ish close to the boundary and in the odd charge state
of QD2, which can for example be seen by following the
Andreev resonances marked with a yellow arrow. In the
main text, we focus on Andreev states in QD1 for a ﬁxed
even charge state of QD2, but close to its charge degen-
eracy point. The corresponding gate voltage region is
indicated by an orange line in Fig. 15(c).

Appendix B: Model results for large ΓS

Figure 16 shows the model calculation of the diﬀer-
ential conductance according to Eqs. (5) and (6) in the
∆ → ∞ limit for the same parameters as in Fig. 10, but
with a twice as large ΓS. This calculation reproduces
at least qualitatively the measurements in region R2 of
Fig. 8(b), which shows the data for a large-ΓS AR.

Assumed electronic conﬁguration of the CNT device.

3. Device C

In Fig. 15, G1 and G2 of device C are plotted as a
function of the sidegate voltages VSG1 and VSG2, for the
ac bias applied to S, but with VS = VBG = 0, for S in
the normal state at B = 0.4 T (a-b) and in the supercon-
ducting state at B = 0 (c-d).

In contrast to device A and B, a charge stability dia-
gram with anti-crossings characteristic for a double quan-
tum dot with strong inter-dot coupling and hybridization
is observed in the normal state of S. In Fig. 15(a) and
(b), the dominant conductance lines with diﬀerent slopes
in G1 and G2 are consistent with resonances of QD1 or
QD2. An apparent smearing of the resonances in every
other charge state, both for QD1 and QD2, is due to

FIG. 15. (Color online) G1 and G2 of device C as a function of
the sidegate voltages VSG1 and VSG2, for VS = V21 = VBG = 0,
at B = 0.4 T (a-b) and at B = 0 (c-d). White dashed arrows
in (a,b) denote diﬀerent slopes consistent with resonances of
QD1 or QD2. The white rectangle marks the region studied in
(c,d). In (c), the orange line corresponds to the gate voltage
region studied in the main text, and dashed lines denote the
charge states of QD2 (even/odd).

a broadening of the AR, a temperature of T = 0.5 K was
assumed.
