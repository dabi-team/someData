ABSTRACT 

Durable  delustered  PET  (PET-TiO2)    fabrics  super  hydrophilic  surface  has  been 

obtained  by  plasma  selecting  etching.    The  aging  effect  of  their  hydrophilicity  after 

plasma treatment has been investigated with storage time. After Ar/O2 radio frequency 

(RF) plasma treatment for only 7 min, PET-TiO2 fabric showed water contact angle of 

0o. After 10 month storage time, it keeps its water contact angle below 75.7o. Further 

more,  with  Xenon  light  irradiation  for  10  min,  it  is  firstly  found  that  it  has  well-

recovered water contact angle to 5°. While the contact angle of PET fabric for 7 min 

returns to 123.0° and its hydrophilicity disappeared almost completely and showed no 

response to Xenon light irradiation. The water absorption rate of 7 min plasma treated 

PET-TiO2 fabric increased by 57.54%. By field emission scanning electron microscopy 

(FE-SEM),  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy 

(XPS)  and  X-ray  diffraction 

analysis(XRD)  measurement,  waviness  structure  of  humps  and  ridges  with  irregular 

particles  or  pits  were  found  on  the  plasma  treated  PET-TiO2  fabric  surface  and 

increased Ti atomic percentage was observed. It is verified that TiO2 particles inside 

PET-TiO2  fiber  have  been  exposed  to  its  surface  by  plasma  selective  etching  of  its 

organic component.  It suppresses the aging effect and is characterized with durable 

and  recoverable  hydrophilicity.  This  one  step,  quick,  green  and  cost-resonable 

manufacture method has a pratical application for durable superhydrophilic surfaces.

1. Introduction 

As  an  important  kind  of  commodity,  polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET)  fabric  is 

commonly used in the textile industry as clothing, sports, packaging, smart, electronic, 

furniture, automotive materials. PET fabric has high performance and many physical, 

mechanical,  and  chemical  advantages,  such  as  durability,  excellent  washing 

performance, light-weight, high tensile strength, flexibility, high transparency, quick-

drying, reduced-wrinkles and shrinkage rate, excellent thermal and chemical stability, 

good  dimensional  stability,  resistance  to  many  environmental  conditions  and  UV 

radiation  as  well  as  low  cost  [1-6].  However,  its  inert  molecular  structure  and  low 

moisture  resorption  rate  make  it  have  a  poor  hydrophilicity  and  uncomfortable  for 

wearing [7, 8]. It has long been explored to induce chemical and physical changes to 

PET fabric surfaces to improve its wettability without affecting its bulk properties [9-

11]. 

   Several chemical techniques have been applied to fabricate hydrophilic PET fabrics 

and  change  its  hand  feeling,  texture  drape,  dyeing  depth  and  fastness  such  as  alkali 

treatment [12], acid treatment [11], aminolysis and graft polymerization etc.. However, 

except the degradation of its bulk properties and the impact on its mechanical properties, 

the high energy consumption, environmental pollution and long period of time are the 

main concerns to its sustainable applications [13-15].   

Plasma treatment is a widely studied method for modifying the surface characteristics 

of organic materials with little damage to its bulk properties [16-18]. PET fabric can be 

made hydrophilic through plasma treatments by introducing highly reactive species on 

its surface. It contains a lot of reactive species such as positive and negative ions, UV 

photons, electrons, excited molecules and atoms, free radicals, which can break down 

covalent  bonds  in  polymers  and  start  many  surface  chemical  reactions  [19].  The 

properties  of  the  treated  surfaces  are  determined  by  the  precursor  gases  from  non-

polymeric (He, Ar, H2O, O2 etc.) or  polymeric gases( CH2CHCOOH, HCHO etc.) and 

reaction  parameters  (frequency,  power,  time,    pressure,  flow  rate  etc.)  [20,  21].  The 

emergence of hydroxyl (—OH), carboxyl (—COOH), and carbonyl groups (=C=O) are 

primarily  promoted  by  O2  plasma.  Besides,  plasma  can  be  employed  for  nano-scale 

texture of fiber surface in dry state. Interestingly, plasma etching on fabric surfaces will 

etch  away  the  organic  component  and  make  rough  surface  through  breaking  out  its 

molcular  bonds  by  ionization  or  dissociation  [12,  22].  The  introduction  of  polar 

functional  groups  or  short  graft  chain  and  rough  surface  make  it  easy  absorption  of 

water or other vapor solvent immediately after plasma treatment. Yu Ren et al [23] used 

a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment on the nanostructure, wettability, 

and  hydrophilic  recovery  of  polylactic  acid  (PLA)  surfaces.  Elabid  et  al  [24]  used 

atmospheric pressure Ar/O2 plasma to tailor the surface morphology, chemical structure 

and enhance the low-temperature dyeability of disperse dyes on PET fabric. Zhang et 

al [25] reported the atmospheric-pressure air/He plasma to enhance PET absorbance for 

water-based pigment inks. Weclawski et al [26]  investigated the effects of combining 

atmospheric plasma with UV excimer laser exposure of nylon  66 fibre surfaces to a 

novel diagnostic dyeing process in the presence or absence of additional UV excimer 

laser exposure. Syromomtina et  al.  [27] used  a low-temperature RF plasma  (oxygen 

and ammonia) to modify poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) P3HB thin films and improve their 

hydrophilic properties by forming polar functional group.  

Despite  these  beneficial  features,  still  there  exist  some  disadvantages  of  plasma 

treatments  for  preparing  super-hydrophilic  surfaces  on  polymers.  After  storage  for 

some  time  in  air  after  plasma  treatment,  the  polymers  become  hydrophobic  again 

because  the  polar  functional  groups  saturate  with  the  environmental  atmosphere  or 

reverse inside for surface energy balance. Therefore,  the hydrophilicity or activity of 

treated  polymer  surfaces  may  wane  with  storage  time  and  so-called  aging  effect  of 

plasma  treatment  has  been  problem  over  time  [28,  29].  PET  fabrics  and  foils  were 

modified by low-pressure RF plasmas with air, CO2, water vapor as well as Ar/O2 and 

He/O2 mixtures and the best hydrophilization effect with respect to water suction and 

aging is obtained by Ar/O2 plasma treatment [30]. The ageing process is related with 

the  storage  conditions  and  can  be  suppressed  by  storing  the  PET  films  at  low 

temperature  or  by  decreasing  the  relative  humidity  of  the  surrounding  air  [31].  The 

wettability of high density polyethylene (HDPE) powders within less than 0.1 s Ar/O2 

plasma surface modification is correlated with the [O]/[C] atomic ratio and the polar 

surface tension and the ageing proceeds mostly within the first 7 days of storage [32].  

    Inorganic semicondutive nanoparticles (such as TiO2, ZnO or SiO2 nanoparticles) is 

usually mixed into melted PET polymer matrix and spinned into PET-TiO2, PET-SiO2 

or PET-ZnO hybride polymer fiber to give it unique functional properties. TiO2 is a 

semiconductor  with  a  bandgap  of  3.2  eV  and  high  refractive  index.  It  is  a  powerful 

hydrophilic  additive  and  white  pigment  which  is  environment  friendly,  low  cost, 

thermally  stable,  source-rich  and  anti-abrasion.  Compared  with  the  vapor  coating or 

sol-gel coating on the fabric surface, the mixing of the inorganic TiO2 nanoparticle with 

the polymer matrix is easy and their combing is strong enough and refer the polymer 

with  special  UV  absorption,  silky  appearance,  soft  hand  feeling,  texture  drape 

properties or wettability [33]. According to the amount of TiO2 nanoparticles mixed 

into PET polymer, 'clear' or 'semi-dull' or ‘dull'（delustered）PET  fibers are obtained 

popularly  for  different  uses  [34].  However,  the  TiO2  nanoparticles  inside  the  PET 

matrix can not display the same functionality as in its powder form, especially the role 

of its surface-related functionality. Because TiO2 particles have been wrapped around 

with PET polymers and their surface are covered with a very thin polymer layer, the 

surface-related  or  contacting-related  properties  of  TiO2  can  not  be  exhibited  well 

enough.  

    In this paper, we developed a one-step and simple technique to prepare a durable and 

recoverable  PET  fabric  surface  using  delustered  PET-TiO2  sample  with  plasma 

selective etching.  Both pure PET fabric and delustered PET fabric were employed and 

treated  by  plasma.  However,  the  hydrophilicity  of  the  plasma-treated  pure  PET 

disappeared almost completely after 10 month storage. While plasma treated delustered 

PET  fabric  showed  much  better  hydophilicity  retention.  TiO2  nanoparticles  in 

delustered PET fabric have been verified to be exposed to its fiber surface by plasma 

etching.  Additionally,  with  Xenon  light  irradiation  for  several  minutes,  the  super-

hydrophilicity of the treated delustered PET fabric is recovered  at once and its water 

contact angle was kept between 50 to 13.80 during further monthly periodic irradation.

Experimental  

2.1.  Materials  

The plain weave pure PET (weight ∼50 g m−2) and delustered PET fabrics (weight 

∼64.7 g m−2) with about <2.0% weight percentage TiO2 nanoparticles were provided 

by Hua Fang Co. Ltd., China. The fabric samples were washed in distilled water in an 

ultrasound bath for 30 min at 80◦C, then dried in a 70°C oven for 1 hour. The cleaned 

fabrics were cut into 25 cm × 25 cm dimensions for the experiment. Argon and oxygen 

(Shanghai Chenggong Gas Industry Co. Ltd., 99.99%) were used as discharge gases.   

2.2.   Plasma treatment process 

   A capacitor (AP-600/300TM Nordson, March, USA) coupled radio frequency plasma 

with 13.56 MHz power source was used for the surface etching and operated in vacuum 

[35]. The samples were placed between the upper and lower parallel shelf electrodes 

with a 5 cm gap. Oxygen and Argon were supplied into the reactor and the working 

pressure was kept at 280 mTorr. The mass flowmeters were used to control the flow 

rate of O2 (93 sccm) and argon (7 sccm). The plasma treatment was conducted at 375W 

power with different etching times (0.5 ~ 7 min). As we all know, TiO2 nanoparticles 

is a photo-active material and demonstrated a strong super-hydrophilic behavior under 

irradiation of light [36]. So, after storage in air at room temperature, the samples were 

irradiated  with  a  300W  Xenon  lamp  (Perfect  light.  China)  with  1  m  distance.  The 

samples  are  named  with  different  experimental  conditions  and  the  *  means  samples 

with 10 min light irradiation shown in Table 1.

2.3. Surface characterization 

   Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi Ltd., Japan) 

was adopted to observe the surface morphology of the samples. The chemical states of 

sample surfaces were identified through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with 

a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD XPS (Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi, USA) using an Al 

K,  X-rays  radiation  source  (1253.6  eV).  For  XPS  spectra  processing,  Avantage 

software was employed to deconvolve and analyze the C1s, O1s, and Ti2p peaks. For 

crystalline structure analysis, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were completed 

on a Rigaku diffractometer (D/max-2550 PC, Japan)  with a revolving anode and a Cu 

kα radiation source (λ=1.54056×10–10 m). For the test, a current of 150 mA and a voltage 

of 40 kV were used. A DropmeterTM professional A-200 device (Ningbo Haishu Meishi 

Detection Technology Company, China) was used to measure the water contact angles 

with 5 μL of deionized water.

Results and Discussion 

3.1   Morphology  

  
Figure 1. The FE-SEM images of (a) PET,  (b) PET-1, (c) PET-7, (d)  PET-TiO2, (e) 

PET-TiO2-1, (f) PET-TiO2-7 and the inset is the particles distribution. 

    Fig. 1 shows the morphology changes of the samples by using FE-SEM. Fig. 1(a) 

shows that the surface of the untreated PET fabric sample without TiO2 nanoparticles 

is smooth. Following the plasma treatments for 1 min, the PET fabric surface presents 

a slight roughness on the surface, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The roughness increases with 

the time increasing to 7 min and the surface is structured with aligned forming rows of 

humps and ridges in Fig. 1(c). The etched structure were created when Ar/O2 plasma 

active species as (Ar*, Ar+, O-, O2

+, O+ etc.) reach and react with the polymer surface 

[37].  The  organic  component  is  etched  away  through  breaking  down  the  polymer 

covalent bonds and active groups like —COOH, —C=O, —C—OH were introduced 

 
onto  the  fiber  surface  [17,  38].  The  waveness  structure  is  also  due  to  the  partly 

cyrstallined domains of PET fibers uniaxially drawn with high speed and the different 

etching ratio of crystalline to amorphous phase [39].  

     The  surface  of  the  untreated  PET-TiO2  fabric  was  rough  with  some  sparely 

distributed nanoparticles as in Fig. 1(d). After 1 min plasma etching treatment, the PET-

TiO2-1  fabric  sample  surface  became  rougher  with  small  etching  nanopits  and 

nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1(e). It is estimated that the nanopits and nanoparticles 

are exposed TiO2 from the inner of the fiber to its outer surface as we will verify later. 

As shown in Fig. 1(f), the roughness of the PET-TiO2-7 fabric surface increased and 

showed similiar waviness structure composed of humps and ridges as in pure PET-7 

but  with  more  identified  pits.  The  size  of  the  main  particles  was  calculated  and  the 

distribution was shown in the inset. These irregular pits and particles were visible with 

a  larger  size  than  those  observed  in  Fig.  1(e),  which  could  be  attributed  to    TiO2 

nanoparticles protruding out of the surface.  

   As investigated in our previous studies through atomic force microscope (AFM) of 

pure PET and PET-TiO2 fabric surface before and after Ar/O2 plasma treatment, the 

root mean square roughness (RMS) of pure PET and PET-TiO2 increased from 4.2 nm 

to  23.71  nm  and  22.35  nm  to  45.61  nm  successively  [40].  The  obvious  variation  of 

RMS  of  treated  PET  and  PET-TiO2  indicates  that  their  etching  process  is  different. 

Because of the etching rate differences of organic PET polymer and inorganic TiO2 in 

Ar/O2 atmosphere, the surface organic PET thin layer  covered on TiO2 particles are 

etched away and TiO2 nanoparticles are exposed to the surface. Then the exposed TiO2 

nanoparticles works as a mask for prohibiting further etching of the polymer matrix. 

This selective etching of organic PET polymers creates a higher RMS surface with large 

amount of exposing TiO2 nanoparticles. 

3.2.  Chemical composition 

The  chemical  composition  of  the  samples  were  investigated  by  XPS.  The  high-

resolution spectra of C1s, O1s, and Ti2p of PET and PET-TiO2 with plasma treatment 

were shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The atomic concentration of C1s, O1s, and Ti2p are 

listed in Table 2.  

    C1s  peaks  of  PET  and  PET-TiO2  were  deconvoluted  to  three  peaks  of  carbon-

containing groups and appeared at 284.76 (C–C/C–H), 286.40 (C–O/COH), and 288.8 

eV (O–C=O/COOH), and shown in Fig. 2(a)-(c) and Fig. 3(a)-(c), respectively. With 

the treatment time increasing, the intensity of C–C/C–H decreases, while C–O and C=O 

increase. This corresponds to the introduction of more polar oxygen groups like C–O, 

COH, O-C═O and COOH on the fabric surface after plasma treatment. 

      Fig.  2(d)-(f)  show  that  the  spectra  of  O1s  for  PET  were  divided into  two  peaks, 

531.77 eV and 533.31 eV. As in Fig 3 (d)-(e), the O1s peaks of PET-TiO2 and PET-

TiO2-1 samples appeared at 531.68 eV and 533.25 eV. Morever, a new O1s peak of 

PET-TiO2-7 sample appeares at about 530.05 eV. The peaks at 531.77 eV and 531.68 

eV represented O-C═O, and the peaks at 533.31 eV and 533.25 eV were attributed to 

C-O. Following plasma treatment of 1 min and 7min, the atomic ratio of [O]/[C] for 

PET increased from 46.42% to 50.22% and increased from 52.48% to 56.60% for PET-

TiO2, respectively as shown in Table 2. The increased O1s intensity of O-C═O and C–

O peaks is well corresponds to increased C1s band intensity of  O-C═O /COOH, C–O 

/ C=O above [24]. The O1s new peak at 530.05 eV of  PET-TiO2-7 sample indicates an 

increase in the surface is belong to Ti-O. 

   The XPS spectra of Ti2p peaks are shown in Fig 2 and Fig 3. The pure PET samples 

are Ti2p free even after different plasma treatment. Mealwhile, the  PET-TiO2 fabric 

shows  obvious  Ti2p  peaks  after  7  min  plasma  treatment.  It  contains  three  Ti2p 

deconvolution peaks: the peak at 458.9 eV attributed to Ti4+ 2p3/2, the peak at 464.7 eV 

ascribed to Ti4+ 2p1/2 and the peak at 457.9 eV due to the Ti3+ 2p1/2  caused by the oxygen 

vacancies  in  the  surface  layer  by  the  plasma  exposure  [41].  Since  the  organic 

component of the PET-TiO2 fabric shares the different etch rate to the TiO2 particles, it 

are easy removed and the particles remain on the fibers surface. The XPS results above 

are summarized in Table 2.

    The XRD patterns of the samples were shown in Fig 4. In the PET sambles XRD 

patterns, TiO2 peaks are missed even after plasma treatment. Meanwhile, TiO2 in PET-

TiO2 and PET-TiO2-7 fabric were detected. Peaks were found at 25.4°, 38.1°, and 48.2°, 

which relate to crystalline phase (101), (004), and (200) of anatase TiO2, respectively, 

verifying the crystal phase with a standard XRD pattern of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS files 

No. 21-1272) [42].

3.3.  Wettability of PET and PET-TiO2 fabrics with different treating methods. 

      As shown in the XPS results, plasma etching introduce hydrophilic groups on the 

surface,  which  may  caused  it  turns  to  hydrophilic.  The  static  water  contact  angle 

measurement before and after plasma treatment immediately are shown in Fig. 5. The 

original PET and PET-TiO2 fabrics are 133.6° and 122.8°, respectively. The plasma-

treated pure PET fabric samples for 0.5 min, 1 min, 3min and 7 min decreased to 44.3°, 

23.5°, 12.3 ° and 0°, respectively. Meanwhile, PET-TiO2 fabric with the same treated 

time are found to be 19.1°, 0°, 0°, 0°, respectively. This means that plasma treatment 

for improving hydrophilicity is more effective for PET-TiO2 fabric than for pure PET 

fabric.  

 
Figure 5. Water contact angles of PET  and PET-TiO2 fabric samples with different 

plasma treatment time. 

    In this study, the plasma etched fabric samples of  PET-7 and PET-TiO2-7 displayed 

the similar aging effect are shown in Fig. 6 by static water contact angle measurement. 

Immediately  following  plasma  etching,  the  contact  angles  of  both  PET-7  and  PET-

TiO2-7 fabrics considerably decreased to 0º. Storage in room temperature atmosphere 

to 10 months, a gradual increased trend of hydrophobic nature was observed for PET-

7 and PET-TiO2-7 fabric samples with time. However, the PET-TiO2-7 fabric sample 

shows smaller rise rate and more stable hydrophilicity than PET-7 fabric sample. After 

10 months, the contact angle of PET-7 fabric returns to 123.0°, while that of the  PET-

TiO2-7 fabric returns to 75.7°. This means a durable and different aging process of PET-

TiO2-7 sample. After plasma treatment, PET fabric undergoes non-permanent physical 

and chemical changes on its surface [43]. Plasma-etched surfaces have a tendency to 

reverse  their  changes  and  return  to  their  original  chemical  state  over  time  [44]  in  a 

phenomenon  known  as  ageing  effect  and  become  hydrophobic  again.  Surface 

functional groups activated by plasma have a short shelf life because they reconfigure 

to lower energy states (not durable/stable) [21, 45]. Increasing the treatment time and 

 
power may result in a more intensive creation of these groups within the surface layer, 

as  well  as  a  deeper  surface  modification  of  the  sample  surface.  Other  treatment  or 

storage conditions have also shown influences on the aging effects, which may slow 

but  never  stops  the  aging  process  [46,  47].  It  is  also  interesting  to  find  that  the 

wettability of the PET-TiO2-7 fabric storaged for 10 months was recovered after 10 min 

Xenon light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 6. The water contact angle of PET-TiO2*-7 

fabric decreases from 75.7° to about 5° and becomes superhydrophilic. This displays 

that the plasma aging effect has been suppressed to a great extent by combining with 

short time Xenon light irradiation on PET-TiO2-7 fabric. However, the water contact 

angle  of  PET*-7  fabric  decreased  from  123°  to  about  119.9°  only,  which  is  not 

significantly changed and still shows hydrophobic character.

TiO2 fabric with storage time and Xenon light irradiation. 

 
     
Figure 7.  Water contact angle variation of PET-TiO2*-7 fabric with different Xenon 

light irradiation. 

  Water  contact  angle  variation  of  PET-TiO2*-7  fabric  with  different  Xenon  light 

irradiation were investigated and shown in Fig. 7. After 5 min irradiating, PET-TiO2*-

7  fabric  decreases  from  75.7°  to  about  37.7°.  Interestingly,  after  10  min  under 

irradiation of light, it shows a super-hydrophilic surface, and its water contact angle 

values were decreased from 37.7° to about 5°. The water contact angle is not further 

decresasd after the irradiation time increases to 15, 20, 25 and 30 min.  

Figure 8.  Superhydrophilicity mechanism on the surface exposed by TiO2 particles.  

   TiO2  is  famous  of  light-induced  hydrophilicity  [48].  Electron  and  hole  pairs  are 

produced  on  the  TiO2  surface  due  to  exposed  TiO2  nanoparticles  activated  by  light 

irradiation,  which  will  react  with  H2O  molecules  via  a  strong  electrostatic  complex. 

 
 
Ultraviolet irradiation may create surface oxygen vacancies at bridging sites, resulting 

in  the  conversion  of  relevant  Ti4+  sites  to  Ti3+  sites  [49]  which  are  favourable  for 

dissociative  water  adsorption  [50,  51].  Accordingly,  PET-TiO2*-7  fabric  surface 

displayed superhydrophilicity, as shown in Figure 8. 

Figure  9.    Water  contact  angle  variation  of  PET*-7  and  PET-TiO2*-7  fabric  with 

storage time during irradiation cycles. 

   Further monthly periodic irradiation of Xenon light on pure PET-7 and PET-TiO2-7 

fabric storaged for 10 months was done to compare the light effects on their recovery 

super-hydrophilicity. The water contact angles of the samples were tested every month 

before and after irradiation of 10 min. Water contact angles during irradiation cycles 

were shown in Fig. 9. The water contact angle of PET*-7 fabric increased slowly during 

the one month further storage time but it has almost no reply after irradiation. The water 

angles of PET-TiO2*-7 fabric decreases to 5o and increases to about 13.8o after 1 month 

storage.  The  sample  show  well  recoverable  light-induced  hydrophilicity  in  the 

following cycle test. 

 
 
XPS of  PET*-7 and PET-TiO2*-7 storaged for 10 months were measured before and 

after the first 10 min Xenon light irradiation cycle for samples. No obvious moving of 

the peak position of C1s, O1s, and Ti2p and their XPS curves are omitted here. The 

atomic concentrations of C1s, O1s, and Ti2p are listed in Table 3. It is noticed that there 

is a very small changes of C1s, O1s, and Ti2p atomic concentration before and after 10 

min  Xenon  light  irradiation.  However,  two  important  comparision  results  sould  be 

indicated. One is that the changes of  O1s and T2p atomic concentration before and 

after 10 min Xenon light irradiation is  much smaller than that  undergoing 7 min plasma 

etching both for PET and PET-TiO2 samples. These results display that plasma etching 

is more effective for the structure and composition changes for PET-TiO2 than Xenon 

light in our experiment. The other one is that the atomic concentration of O1s for PET-

7  and  PET-TiO2-7  all  decreased  than  those  10  month  ago.  But  the  O1s  atomic 

concentration of PET-7 decreased much more and is still lower than that for PET-TiO2-

7 after 10 month storage. The exposed TiO2 nanoparticles on PET-TiO2-7 fabric surface 

make its O1s keep at a higher atomic concentration and response to the Xenon light 

irradiation effectively [52, 53]. 

   Therefore, in the case of PET-TiO2 fabric, its wetting behavior and aging effect is 

mainly  influenced  by  the  exposed  TiO2  nanoparticles,  introduction  of  polar  oxygen 

groups and increased roughnes.  As we know, TiO2 is a large bandgap photocatalyst. It 

exhibits superhydrophilic surface behavior, together with a water contact angle value 

of zero under UV light [36, 54]. In theory, TiO2 can be activated and generate electron-

hole pairs. Under the full spectrum of 220-1200 nm of Xenon light, the photo-generated 

electrons can convert the Ti4+ state to the Ti3+ state and the holes react at bridging sites, 

resulting  in  oxygen  vacancies  [55].  Water  molecules  in  the  air  occupy  the  oxygen 

vacancies, producing OH radicals and making the surface more hydrophilic. Because 

Ti3+  introduction  and  its  narrowed  bandgap  by  plasma  etching,  PET-TiO2-7  fabric 

exhibites improved durable and recoverable super-hydrophilicity under irradiation of 

Xenon light.

As etched PET-TiO2 fabrics also exihibite improved water absorption rate :  

WA% =

Ww−Dw

Dw

× 100% 

  Where WA is the water absorption rate%, Ww is the dipped weight in g, and DW is 

the  dry  weight  in  g.  In  Figure  10a,  it  is  shown  that  WA%  increases  with  the  plasm 

etching time and changes from 70.5% to 81.16% for pure PET and 77.92% to 93.03% 

for  PET-TiO2  at  the  processing  time  of  1min  and  7min,  respectively.  In  order  to 

illustrate how water absorption rate is increased after plasma etching, improvement rate 

(I%) was calculated using the water absorption rate% in accordance with the following 

equation:  

I% =

W1−W0

W0

× 100% 

   Where W1 and W0 are, respectively, the weight of the treated and untreated fabric 

samples. In Figure 10b, it is observed that the improvement rate is  46.1% and 57.54% 

respectively  for  pure  PET-7  and  PET-TiO2-7,  comparing  with  its  untreated 

corresponding fabric samples. Except to the polar oxygen functional groups, this result 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is also attributed to the increased RMS and large amount of exposed TiO2 nanoparticles 

after plasma etching.

and after plasma treatment. 

3.4. Suggested mechanism of the durable and recoverable superhydrophilicity of the 

surface 

      Figure 11 shows a flow diagram of the durable and recoverable superhydrophilic 

PET-TiO2*-7 fabric preparation process. The entire process can be divided in two steps: 

low-pressure Ar/O2 RF plasma surface etching treatment and Xenon light irradiation.  

    When PET-TiO2 fiber surface is being treated with O2/Ar plasma, a lot of physical 

and chemical reactions are expected to occur on the surface by the combardment  of 

ions, high-energy electron, photons, radicals and other metastable species. These active 

species can lead to the chain scission or dissociation of the polymer covered on the top 

of  TiO2  particles  or  around  them,  which  will  etch  and  extract  away  the  organic 

components especially their amorphous phases, which creates surface etching patterns 

like in Fig. 1(e),(f). Because of higher etching rate of Ar/O2 plasma on organic PET 

than on inorganic TiO2, further etching proceeds selectively around TiO2 nanoparticles 

and  makes  TiO2  be  exposed  on  the  surface  with  higher  RMS.  Ar/O2  plasma  also 

introduces reactive groups and produces large amounts of highly reactive polymer chain 

ends, such as free radicals, excited molecular oxygen and some oxidized polar anionic 

 
groups on the fiber surface like in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Although the etching rate on TiO2 

is slow, the RF plasma etching also has the tendency to generate oxygen vacancies and 

Ti3+ on TiO2 nanoparticles as displayed in Fig. 3 for further exposed treatment time. 

Because of the rougher surface, exposed TiO2 nanoparticles, polar oxygen groups and 

Ti3+ caused by plasma etching, PET-TiO2 fabric displayed superhydrophilicity after 7 

min  plasma  treatment. PET-TiO2-7 fabric  kept higher O1s atomic  concentration and 

showed  improved  and  durable  hydrophilicity  under  the  room  atmosphere  until  10 

months. However, the hydrophilicity of treated pure PET is almost lost at all after 10 

month storage time because of the active polymer chain reorientation inward and its 

O1s atomic concentration decrease. 

  In the second step of Xenon light irradiation, the XPS results show that Xenon light 

irradiation does not change the compositions of PET fabric obviously. But the PET-

TiO2-7 fabric surface with exposed anatase TiO2 nanoparticles and Ti3+ defect state is 

able  to  make  use  of  the  full  spectrum  of  the  Xenon  light.  Once  PET-TiO2-7  fabric 

surface has been excited by Xenon light irradiation, electron and hole pairs are formed 

on the PET-TiO2*-7 fabric, which induces photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles. 

TiO2  nanoparticles  will  react  with  H2O  molecules.  Hydrophilicity  is  enabled  by 

activated  sites  with  a  polarity  that  prefer  to  attract  H2O  molecules  via  a  strong 

electrostatic complex. Based on this, the dense clusters of hydroxyl groups can keep 

their surface charges and attract H2O molecules within the complex when the number 

of  Ti-OH  groups  is  sufficient.  When  the  samples  contain  a  large  amount  of  donor-

acceptor  complex,  the  most  upper  surfaces  become  polar,  resulting  in  long-term 

hydrophilicity [56-58]. Therefore, the exposed TiO2 by Ar/O2 plasma eching is most 

important for the durable superhydrophilicity under room atmosphere storage and its 

recovery under Xenon light irradiation.  

    The aging effect of PET-TiO2-7 and PET-TiO2*-7 is caused not only by the further 

polymer  chain  orientation  and  the  Ti-OH  groups  relax,  but  also  by  the  organic 

contamination absorbed on TiO2 nanoparticle surface. However, the exposed TiO2 can 

recover  surface  charge  polarity  and  regain  its  hydrophilicity  under  Xenon  light 

irradiation  [59].  Therefore,  a  durable  and  recoverable  superhydrophilicity  surface  is 

prepared.

Conclusion 

   In  summary,  we  demonstrated  an  efficient,  simple,  and  environmentally  friendly 

method for producing durable and recoverable superhydrophilic delustered PET fabric 

surface by plasma selected etching. First, by using delustered PET fabric and across 

plasma etching treatment, part of organic components have been selectively removed. 

The  FE-SEM  revealed  a  micro/nano  waviness  structure  of  humps  and  ridges  on  the 

fabric surface, along with exposed outstanding TiO2 nanoparticles. XPS results show 

an increase of O1s atomic concentration and introduction of polar oxygen groups. The 

delustered PET fabric samples became more hydrophilic than PET fabric after the same 

 
time plasma etching treatment. After 10 months of storage, it still maintained the water 

contact angle at about 75°, showing better anti-aging performance. Interestingly, after 

Xenon light irradiation for only 10 min, the storaged PET-TiO2 fabric for 10 months 

shows  a  well-recovered  superhydrophilic  surface  immediately,  and  its  water  contact 

angle was kept at about 5°~13.8o during the monthly irradiation cycles. It is verified 

that the TiO2 nanoparticles exposed on PET fiber surface by plasma selective etching 

are the main causes of the durable and recoverable superhydrophilic delustered PET 

fabric. This study  provides  an environmental  friendly  and excellent potential benign 

technique which can construct a durable hydrophilicity of PET fabric surface and could 

be easy recovered by light even after 10 month storge.
