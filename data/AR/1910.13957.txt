Abstract. TREX-DM (TPC Rare Event eXperiment for Dark Matter) is intended to look
for low mass WIMPs in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain, using light
elements (Ne, Ar) as target in a high pressure TPC equipped with Micromegas readouts. Here, a
description of the detector, the ﬁrst results from commissioning data and the expected sensitivity
from the developed background model are brieﬂy presented.

1. Detector and Commissioning data
TREX-DM [1, 2] uses a gas TPC equipped with micromesh gas ampliﬁcation structures
(Micromegas), holding 24 l of gas at 10 bar (corresponding to 300 g of Ar, or alternatively,
160 g of Ne) inside a 6-cm-thick copper vessel with a central cathode deﬁning two active
volumes. The ﬁeld cage is made of kapton and copper, covered by teﬂon. The two Micromegas
readout planes, manufactured at CERN, have the largest surface (25×25 cm2) ever produced
with the microbulk technique; they have low intrinsic radioactivity and allow to get topological
information to discriminate signal from background. The detector is operated in the hall A of
LSC (at 2450 m.w.e.) inside a shielding made of copper, lead and neutron moderator (see Fig. 1);
radon-free air is ﬂushed inside the shielding. AGET-based electronics is being used, allowing to
trigger from the low capacitance strips signals (256 in X, 256 in Y, with 1 mm pitch); then, an
1 is expected.
eﬀective energy threshold at 100-400 eVee
The detector was installed underground in Canfranc along 2018 and ﬁrst tests with
atmospheric Ar-1%iC4H10 at 1.5 bar were made. In 2019, the gas was changed to the baseline
mixture Ne-2%iC4H10 working in recirculation, going progressively to higher pressures up
to 8 bar in fall 2019. Despite some connectivity problems experienced, which were solved
ﬁnally implementing face-to-face connections at the two readouts, the preliminary assessment
of data seems positive. Following the calibration data and short background runs taken, rough
calculations of the energy threshold conﬁrm the expectations. Figure 2 shows the acquired
strip pulses for a 8 keV event from copper ﬂuorescence and in Fig. 3 the raw energy spectrum
measured in a 109Cd calibration using Ar is depicted; the structure at 45 keV is due to pile-up.

2. Background model and Sensitivity
An exhaustive radioassay program has been performed over the last years to construct the
detector with radiopurity speciﬁcations, mainly based on germanium gamma spectrometry at
LSC and complementary measurements from GDMS, ICPMS and the BiPo-3 detector. The
background model developed by Monte Carlo simulation for the present set-up points to levels
at 1-10 keV−1 kg−1 d−1 in the region of interest [3].
It is based on Geant4 (for Physics
processes) and a custom-made code called REST (for electron generation, diﬀusion eﬀects, charge
ampliﬁcation and signal generation). Material radioactivity and environmental backgrounds in
Canfranc (gamma-rays, neutrons and muons) have been considered.
In the region from 0.2
to 7 keVee, the simulated contribution from internal components (at or inside the vessel) is
<6.1(6.6) keV−1 kg−1 d−1 for Ar(Ne), while that of external components is <0.43(0.56) keV−1
kg−1 d−1 for Ar(Ne). As shown in Fig. 4, the two main quantiﬁed contributions (the activated
copper vessel and 40K in Micromegas) should be suppressed to get a background at the level of
1 keV−1 kg−1 d−1. A roadmap to further decrease it down to 0.1 keV−1 kg−1 d−1 is underway.
Prospects for exclusion plots have been evaluated for Spin-Independent interaction and
standard halo model for three diﬀerent experimental scenarios at a pressure of 10 bar, assuming
diﬀerent background levels (10, 1 and 0.1 keV−1 kg−1 d−1), energy thresholds (0.4, 0.1 and
0.1 keVee) and exposures (0.3, 0.3 and 10 kg y) [3] and are shown in Fig. 5. Energy conversion
between electronic and nuclear recoils is based on the commonly used parametrization in terms
of the atom and mass numbers [3]. The best assumed conditions would provide a competitive
sensitivity in the direct detection of low mass WIMPs. Operation with Ne ﬁrst and underground
Ar afterwards is foreseen as soon as the commissioning phase is ﬁnished.
