In this paper, we construct and calculate a non-perturbative path integrals in a multiply-connected
space-time. This is done by by summing over homotopy classes of paths. The topology of the space-
time is deﬁned by Einstein-Rosen bridges (ERB) forming from the entanglement of quantum foam
described by virtual black holes. As these ‘bubbles’ are entangled, they are connected by Plankian
ERB’s because of the ER = EP R conjecture. Hence the space-time will possess a large ﬁrst Betti
number B1. For any compact 2-surface in the space-time, the topology (in particular the homotopy)
of that surface is not-trivial, due to the large number of Plankian ERB’s that deﬁne homotopy though
this surface. The quantisation of space-time with this topology - along with the proper choice of
the 2-surfaces - is conjectured to allow anon-perturbative path integrals of quantum gravity theory
over the space-time manifold.

INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, a new approach in understanding
and constructing quantum geometry had emerged from
linking geometric quantities to information-theoretic one.
This idea ﬁrst emerged from the calculation of entropy of
spherically symmetric isolated horizons (SSIH) in Loop
quantum gravity [3, 12]. Later, the emergence of holo-
graphic principle to include the ‘entanglement entropy’
of the vacuum to be linked to the are of the surface en-
closing a geodesic-generated ball [16]. A deeper link link
between quantum geometry and information theory was
established [13], as a solution to AMPS / Firewall para-
dox [1]. This solution suggested that for two black holes
collapsed from an entangled matter, these black holes
would be connected by an Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB).
This conjecture became widely known as the ER = EP R
conjecture. One can go even further with conjecture and
claim that for any pair of entangled particles, there is a
Plankian ERB, that matter will not fall into it. However,
this can considered in an abstract geometric sense [7].
The development of this conjecture has raised the pos-
sibility that space-time could be interwoven by entangle-
ment, and wormholes could be holding the space-time to-
gether, This idea has been applied in category theory and
topological quantum ﬁeld theory to show that quantum
ﬂuctuations correspond to formation of wormholes and
vice versa [4]. Technically speaking, the ER = EP R
raises the possibility that space-time could multiply con-
nected. However, how one could start doing physics in
multiply-connected space-time ? More importantly, how
to formulate the physic of multiply connected space-time;
and would it help to do so ?
The most basic way to start is by replacing the points
by a non-Abelian algebra
of the space-time manifold

This is a direct result of combining gravitation theory
with uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics.
It is
immediately recognised that ℓp is the Plank length, and
the relation (1) implies that space-time at the Plank
scale consists of what-so-called quantum foam [19]. First
described by J. Wheeler and later studied in detail by
S. Hawking [11], this quantum foam consists of a sea
of virtual black holes, which Hawking described them
as bubbles. These bubbles make the space-time posses
a large second Betti number. Moreover, in his paper,
Hawking argued that the space-time is simply connected
S2 or K3 ×
and admits a topology S2
Nevertheless,
these bubbles can form the multiply-
connected space-time we are looking for if we considered
the ER = EP R conjecture.
In this paper, we shall
discuss how to deﬁne a multiply-connected space-time
combing both ideas discussed above. Next, show how this
picture could help in the theory of quantum gravity, after
that an application for this conjecture is discussed at the
hand-waving level by recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking
formula for Black hole entropy. Finally, we will point out
the possible steps for this programme that ought to be
taken in order to make the argument in this paper more
formal.

These rules imply a Fock space 1 and thereby we can
deﬁne a Hamiltonian H, whose expectation value over
any vacuum state diverges as it is known from stand-
ard quantum ﬁeld theory. The only non- perturbative
method to remove such divergence is to impose some
UV-cutoﬀ on the modes of the ﬁled. This cutoﬀ con-
dition can be made because of the gravity theory present
on
. For general relativity (GR) one can ﬁnd this
cutoﬀ term to be for modes with wavelengths less than
or equal to the plank length ℓp = 1 in Plankian units In
the semi-classical GR, the geometry itself ﬂuctuates like
the quantum ﬁelds that lie on it to show this take a small
3-space like surface σ, let it be a geodesic-generated ball
with radius l. We now integrate Einstein ﬁeld equations
over this ball (in some chart deﬁned over that small ball),

Thus the radius of curvature domain is divergent, imply-
ing that the geometry is not supposed to exist with ﬁeld
ﬂuctuating like that. Hence, locality and ﬂat geometry
cannot coexist. To get rid of that divergence we use
the uncertainty relation ∆Rµxµ
1 . This is derived
from Hawking’s assumption about the quantum struc-
ture of space-time at the micro scale [11], as a sea of
virtual blackholes. By this assumption, we cannot deﬁne
the ﬁeld nor the geometry at one point, but rather a

region with minimal length. Thus geometry ﬂuctuation
is a key element in the stability of classical geometry.
Concluding geometry must me quantised, i.e. the space-
time is made from discrete bubbles of geometry. This
result is obtained without assumptions outside GR and
quantum theory.Virtual black holes were also studied in
third quantised formalism of canonical quantum grav-
ity [6], in dilatorn gravity theories ??, and in other altern-
ative theories as in generalised uncertainty principle and
their phenomenological implications in proton decay [2]
and higher spin theories from Teukolsky equations [15].
Virtual black holes are also important in understanding
the black hole information paradox [5], for example, it has
been shown that the S-matrix of scattering processes by
virtual black hole is incoherent [10], leading to a possible
indication that information paradox could be resolved
by studying the phenomenology of scattering by virtual
black holes [9].
The predictions of quantum mechanics, these nearby vir-

consider black holes in a box , each black hole will emit
Hawking radiation to be absorbed by the others, even
when the system reaches thermal equilibrium, this pro-
cess will continue to happen. If we assign a density mat-
rix for this system, it will evolve to a mixed states dens-
ity matrix over time, even if we started with a pure state
(each state describes a Black hole.). Viz., black holes
will get entangled by absorbing each other’s Hawking ra-
diation [13].
Similar argument can be made to the virtual black holes,
that make up the quantum foam. Another way to show
that the quantum foam is indeed entangled, and hence is
ﬁlled with Plankian Wormholes, is the work done by [4],
using category theory, they concluded that the pair pro-
duction of quantum ﬂuctuation correspond to formation
of a wormhole. Although their argument was for topolo-
gical ﬁeld theories, it can be proven that this argument
could be extended to general relativity if we considered it
as a form of BF theory. Identifying the form B =

where e are the triebein ﬁelds corresponding to the 3 met-

However, it remains to be proven explicitly that these
results will hold for full relativistic gravity theory.

III. THE TOPOLOGY OF THE ENTANGLED
QUANTUM FOAM

Since these volume elements (making up) the quantum
foam are entangled, using the ER = EP R conjecture,
each bubble of geometry is connected to another by a
wormhole/ ERB. Making the space-time multiply con-
nected. However, in 3 manifolds, we cannot clearly deﬁne
the ﬁrst Betti number corresponding the the ﬁrst fun-
damental group. The ﬁrst fundamental group, appears
(well deﬁned) for 2 surfaces. Taking the surface ∆ in
the previous section, and analysing its homotopy we ﬁnd
that, and due to the ER = EP R. We can deﬁne loops
between the ‘in’ and ‘out’ regions that cannot be shrunk
to a point. These loops are made by passing through
the wormholes made by the entangled bubbles. The sur-
face ∆ is them homeomorphic to an N -punctured sphere,
N + 1 being proportional to the area of the surface in
Plank-area units.
The ﬁrst fundamental group for the surface ∆ is gen-
erated by N generators, each go around each puncture
made by a wormhole. Note that we should only con-
sider bubbles entangled in the region Ar(∆)
1, the
entanglement for bubbles further from Plank length is
negligible. Hence the rank of this free group is propor-
tional to Ar(∆). The calculation of the proportionality
constant is rather diﬃcult, because we need to take into
an account that the classical area is obtained only by
ﬁlling the surface with inﬁnite circles, while in quantum
geometry, the ’quantum’ area is a bit less, due to pack-
ing factor (see Tammes Problem, Ref [17]). The exact
number of generator is the number of wormholes forming
between bubbles ﬁlling the area Ar(∆
1) and Ar(∆+1),
assuming all the black holes in these two layers are en-
tangled, the number of the wormholes forming is the area
of the surface ∆ that comes between the layers multi-
plied by a ﬁlling factor, i.e. how many bubbles one can
ﬁt in the volume covered by Ar(∆ + 1) minus the volume
covered by Ar(∆

1).

Rather, one may take two points in
with a 2-spacelike surface σp and q with another σq. Ho-
motopy classes of paths between p and q will be ﬁnite due
to the topology of the surfaces σp and σq. One can pre-
form a non perturbative integration over the homotopy
classes.
Nevertheless, there is a rather peculiar feature of this
technique, that is the dependence of the value of the path
integral of the choice of surfaces. It remains an unsolved
problem that needs special attention. This ‘freedom’ in
choosing the surfaces, could correspond to gauge free-
dom, that one can mod out. Alternatively, there is no
freedom and it is ﬁxed by the theory of gravity, like the
case with the horizon of a black hole, this surface is ﬁxed
by gravity, and one needs to use - only- for the calculation
of action on that surface. Hence the general technique for
calculating path integrals in a multiply-connected space-
time could be summarised in the following points,

Identify the homotopy classes and loops on these

in which the ﬁeld of concern ’lives’. Such than one
can preform parallel transport along the loops.

ﬁnd a proper representation for these groups (loop
representation).

Using the above representation, preform the stand-

V. CONCLUSION

IV. CALCULATION OF PATH INTEGRALS

The topology of space-time could allow a non perturbat-
ive calculation of path integrals, automatically removing
divergences that appear in the standard path integrals.

The action path integrals over a multiply connected
spaces could be shown to be non-peturbative and yield
exact results as one might sum over equivalent classes of
paths that have the same winding number. In fact, in this
paper, we have seen that merging the ideas of minimal
length and creation of pair black holes [11], along with

4

the ER=EPR conjecture [7, 13] could yield a multiply-
connected space-time. Hence path integrals over space-
time with gravity could be non-peturbative.
It could be shown in greater detail that the creation and
inhalation of black-holes as a result of third-quantised
theory of geometry [6]. Hence one could also apply the
non-peturbative techniques to geometry itself. There is
a lot to add to this proposal in order to use it for ex-
act calculation of path integrals , and/or quantisation of
geometry. Based on the microscopic structure of space-
time, and to generalise the calculations in topological
ﬁeld theory [4] to the 4D relativistic space-time, that is
non-topological.
As the topology is scale-independent,the non trivial to-

pology of scape-time caused by the virtual wormholes
forming the quantum foam, could have a low-energy ef-
fects. It would be interesting to investigate such eﬀects
in future work, such as the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, cor-
rections to scattering amplitudes in QED and QCD and
shifts in energy levels of nuclear and atomic systems.
