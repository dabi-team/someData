Abstract
The ﬁxed-target NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) seeks to ﬁnd the critical point
(CR) of strongly interacting matter as well as the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement. The experiment provides a scan of
measurements of particle spectra and ﬂuctuations in protonproton, protonnucleus, and nucleusnucleus interactions as functions
of collision energy and system size, corresponding to a two-dimensional phase diagram (T-µB). New NA61/SHINE results are
shown here, including transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations in Ar+Sc collisions as compared to NA61 p+p and
Be+Be data, as well earlier NA49 A+A results. Recently, a preliminary eﬀect of change in the system size dependence, labelled
as the ”percolation threshold” or the ”onset of ﬁreball”, was observed in NA61/SHINE data. This eﬀect is closely related to
the vicinity of the hadronic phase space transition region and will be discussed in the text.

INTRODUCTION

The NA61/SHINE, understood as the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment, is
the continuation and the extension of the NA49 experiment [1, 2]. It uses a similar experimental ﬁxed-target setup
to NA49 (Figure 1) but with an extended research programme. Beyond an enhanced strong interactions programme,
measurements of hadron production for neutrino and cosmic ray experiments are realized. The collaboration involves
It is the second largest non-LHC (the Large Hadron
about 150 physicists from 15 countries and 30 institutions.
Collider) experiment at the CERN.

FIG. 1. The NA61/SHINE detector consists of a large acceptance hadron spectrometer followed by a set of six Time Projection
Chambers (TPCs) as well as Time-of-Flight detectors (ToFs). The high resolution forward calorimeter, the Projectile Spectator
Detector (PSD), measures energy ﬂow around the beam direction. For hadron-nucleus interactions, the collision volume is
determined by counting low momentum particles emitted from the nuclear target with the Low Momentum Particle Detector
(a small TPC) surrounding the target. An array of beam detectors identiﬁes beam particles, secondary hadrons and nuclei as
well as primary nuclei, and measures their trajectories precisely.

The strong interaction programme of the NA61/SHINE is dedicated to the study of the onset of deconﬁnement and
the search for the critical point (CR) of hadronic matter, related to the phase transition between hadron gas (HG)
and quarkgluon plasma (QGP). The NA49 experiment studied hadron production in Pb+Pb interactions, while the
NA61/SHINE collects data varying beam energy within the range of 13A-158A GeV and varying sizes of the colliding
systems. This is equivalent to the two dimensional scan of the hadronic phase diagram in the (T, µB) plane, as
depicted in Figure 2. The ion collisions research programme was initiated in 2009 with the p+p collisions used later
on as reference data for heavy ion collisions.

Hadron-production measurements for neutrino experiments are just reference measurements of p+C interactions for
the T2K experiment, since they are necessary for computing initial neutrino ﬂuxes at J-PARC. It has been extended
to measure the production of charged pions and kaons produced in interactions out of thin carbon targets and replicas
of the T2K targets what is necessary to test accelerator neutrino beams [3]. Data taking began in 2007.

Collected p+C data also allow for better understanding of nuclear cascades in the cosmic air showers — necessary
in the Pierre Auger and KASCADE experiments [4, 5]. These are reference measurements of p+C, p+p, π+C, and
K+C interactions for cosmic ray physics. The cosmic ray collisions with the Earth’s atmosphere produce secondary
air shower radiation. Some of particles produced in such collisions subsequently decay into muons, which are able to
reach the surface of the Earth. Cosmic ray-induced muon production can allow the reproduction of primary cosmic
ray composition if related hadronic interactions are known [6].

the recorded data are indicated in green, the approved future data taking in red, and the proposed extension for the period
(cid:62) 2018 in grey.

As seen in Figure 3, the phase structure of hadronic matter is involved. Progress in the theoretical understanding
of the subject and the collection of more experimental data will allow us to delve further into the subject. While the
highest energies achieved at the LHC and RHIC colliders provide data related to the crossover HG/QGP regions, the
SPS ﬁxed-target NA61/SHINE experiment is particularly suited to exploring the phase transition line of HG/QGP
with the CR included.

Heavy ion collision (HIC) experiments reproduce the conditions of the ﬁrst 10 µs after the Big Bang, when a phase
transition from the QGP to a hadron gas would have taken place [7]. It appears, however, that the QGP can be
present in the core of massive neutron stars — particularly those with masses exceeding two solar masses [8, 9]. That
would correspond to the far lower right part of the phase plot, beyond the (T, µB) range covered by Figure 3. The
CR has been long predicted for thermal quantum chromodynamics (QCDs) at ﬁnite µB/T [10–12] although this was
not unanimously accepted previously [13]. However, lattice QCD calculations are becoming more and more accurate,

location of a CR is not expected for µB/T (cid:54) 2 and T /Tc(µB = 0) > 0.9 [15]. A more detailed exploration of QCD
phase diagram would need both new experimental data with extended detection capabilities and improved theoretical
models [16].

Another intriguing and far reaching possibility is the Big Bang phase transition scenario, referred to by Edward
Witten as the ”cosmic separation of phases” [17]. In the standard approach, the Big Bang QGP is almost matter-
antimatter symmetric and evolves to lower temperatures through the crossover region almost vertically to the temper-
ature axis [18]. Edward Witten, using almost ”back of envelope” arguments, pointed out the possibility of using the
path of universe starting in the QGP phase from the high baryonic chemical potential region reaching almost zeroth
temperature, with supercooled QGP. Hadronization then becomes quite an explosive phenomena with a necessary
subsequent reheating (see e.g. [19, 20]). Corresponding plots, taken from [19], are shown in Figure 4.

Beyond cosmological eﬀects (little/tepid inﬂation) such a possibility would change also our understanding of the

hadronization eﬀect in HIC processes.

II. NEW NA61/SHINE RESULTS

A.

Irregularities — the Horn

It was expected [23] that ratio K +/π+ produced at HIC energies of about

sN N ≈ 10 GeV should reach a
rapid maximum when QGP formation begins. In 1998 there was not enough experimental data to fully check this
hypothesis. Present collected results fully conﬁrm the appearance of the horn, although there are still discussions
about its relevance to the HG/QGP phase transition.

√

Recent data from NA61/SHINE [24] show also a strong dependence of the eﬀect on the size of the colliding objects,

as seen in Figure 5.

B.

Irregularities — the Step

Plateau: A step-in the inverse slope parameter T of the transverse mass spectra mT at mid-rapidity (0 < y < 0.2)
plotted against the collision energy per nucleon (Figure 6) is expected for the onset of deconﬁnement [23]. The eﬀect
increases with the size of colliding objects. Qualitatively, a similar structure is visible in p+p collisions, with Be+Be
slightly above, consistent with the step structure.

C. Fluctuations

Experimental facilities of NA61 allows to measure ﬂuctuations of various physical quantities which are sensitive
to the vicinity of the critical point. These ﬂuctuations can create a signature for the critical point. An analysis of
ﬂuctuations of various observables, particularly in a range of energies around 8 GeV per colliding nucleon pair at
the center of mass in interactions of light nuclei (it corresponds to the beam energy of 30 GeV in the frame of a
stationary target), is the main goal of the NA61/SHINE experiment. This is just the kinematical region where NA49

of structures in the energy dependence of hadron production in central Pb+Pb collisions which are not observed in
elementary interactions [21, 22]

Preliminary data presented in Figure 7 do not show any signs of critical behaviour [25].

III. SYSTEM SIZE DEPENDENCE

In the recent months, some unexpected results were observed by the NA61/SHINE experiment [24, 26, 27], con-
cerning qualitative diﬀerences in system size dependence behaviour. It appears that in particular Be+Be results are
very close to p+p at diﬀerent collision energies. An example of such behaviour is presented in Figure 8.

ﬂuctuation in Ar + Sc, 7Be + 9Be and p+p collisions. Be+Be almost identical to p+p ﬂuctuation within statistical errors given
by plot’s points sizes.

It looks as if with the increasing size of colliding systems, light clusters are produced more and more copiously, and
at some density they start to overlap to reach percolation threshold. This eﬀect would not depend on energy only,
but also on the size of the system.

Intensive work now is ongoing to achieve more conclusive results, analyzing recently collected data from Xe+La

and Pb+Pb.

The Holy Grail of HIC — Quark Gluon Plasma — still remains an elusive object. Although there are no at
present discussions concerning the very existence of this state of matter, there are still open problems connected with
experimental signatures of many theoretical ideas and predictions in this ﬁeld. The NA61/SHINE experiment acts
in the energy region particularly suited for the appearance of phase transition eﬀects. Beyond this, the ﬁxed-target
technology makes possible to perform 4π geometry measurementswhich are not accessible in collider-type experiments.
To date, collected and analyzed NA61/SHINE data related to theoretical predictions of ﬂuctuations in the presence
of CR have not shown any anomaly that could be attributed to this. These data relate to N − pT ﬂuctuations in
p+p, Be+Be, and Ar+Sc central events.

There is clear system size dependence of mT spectra that diﬀers signiﬁcantly between p+p and A+A events. This

is the eﬀect associated to the transverse collective ﬂow.

The appearance of horn (Figure 5) and step (Figure 6) is in accordance with theoretical predictions for the onset

of deconﬁnement in HIC due to mixed phase of HG and QGP [23].

The recent preliminary results of the NA61/SHINE concerning system size dependence may be also a signature for
the new physical phenomena. There is a clearly visible jump between light and heavy systems. Be+Be results are
very close to the p+p results, independently on the collision energy. In addition, multiplicity ﬂuctuations, close to
p+p value in Be+Be collisions, are strongly suppressed in Ar+Sc collisions.

For the CERN long shutdown 2019-2020, an NA61/SHINE detector upgrade system is foreseen. This would make
the precise measurements of open charm and multi-strange hyperon production possible, which are also of great
importance both for the neutrino physics programme as well as for the precision measurements of cosmic rays.
