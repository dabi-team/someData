ABSTRACT
Using observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied an interesting example of a sigmoid
formation and eruption from small-scale ﬂux canceling regions of active region (AR) 11942. Analysis
of HMI and AIA observations infer that initially the AR is compact and bipolar in nature, evolved to
sheared conﬁguration consisting of inverse J-shaped loops hosting a ﬁlament channel over a couple of
days. By tracking the photospheric magnetic features, shearing and converging motions are observed
to play a prime role in the development of S-shaped loops and further ﬂux cancellation leads to tether-
cutting reconnection of J-loops. This phase is co-temporal with the ﬁlament rise motion followed by
sigmoid eruption at 21:32 UT on January 6. The ﬂux rope rises in phases of slow (vavg = 26 km s−1)
and fast (aavg= 55 ms−2) rise motion categorizing the CME as slow with an associated weak C1.0
class X-ray ﬂare. The ﬂare ribbon separation velocity peaks at around peak time of the ﬂare at which
maximum reconnection rate (2.14 Vcm−1) occurs. Further, the EUV light-curves of 131, 171˚A have
delayed peaks of 130 minutes compared to 94˚A and is explained by diﬀerential emission measure. Our
analysis suggests that the energy release is proceeded in a much long time duration, manifesting the
onset of ﬁlament rise and eventual eruption driven by converging and canceling ﬂux in the photosphere.
Unlike strong eruption events, the observed slow CME and weak ﬂare are indications of slow runway
tether-cutting reconnection where most of the sheared arcade is relaxed during the extended post
phase of the eruption.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar coronal mass ejection (CME) has been a major
objective of research for the past two decades due to its
ability to aﬀect the space weather phenomena tremen-
dously. Hence, many studies have been conducted to-
wards forecasting such eruptions by ﬁnding the suit-
able eruptive conditions from its source regions (Falconer
2001; Falconer et al. 2003; Leka & Barnes 2003a,b; Schri-
jver 2007; Vemareddy & Mishra 2015; Vasantharaju et al.
2018). Also, the appearance of S-shaped structure or
inverse S-shaped structure or simply “Sigmoid” in the
coronal active region is considered to be a progenitor of
CMEs (Rust & Kumar 1996; Chen 2011). Generally the
sheared and twisted ﬁeld lines in sigmoidal structure pos-
sesses large amount of magnetic free-energy and will be
released during CME. Mostly, S-shaped sigmoids are ob-
served in the southern hemisphere and inverse-S shaped
ones are observed in the northern hemisphere (Rust &
Kumar 1996; Pevtsov et al. 2001). This is consistent with
the predominantly negative current helicity observed in
the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern
hemisphere (Seehafer 1990; Pevtsov et al. 1995). Active
regions possessing sigmoids are signiﬁcantly more likely
to be eruptive than non-sigmoid active regions (Canﬁeld
et al. 1999). The sigmoid is now regarded as an im-
portant signature in space weather forecasts (Rust et al.
2005; Vemareddy & Mishra 2015).

Past statistical studies conﬁrm that majority of CMEs

have a clear magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) structure (Vourl-
idas et al. 2013). Since the coronal magnetic ﬁeld cannot
be measured directly, the ﬂux rope model can only seek
for indirect evidence from observations. Rust & Kumar
(1996) proposed that sigmoidal structure in AR can be
explained by the ﬂux rope model. Later several studies
explored the ﬂux rope model with numerical experiments
which conﬁrm by reproducing many of the observational
properties of the sigmoid (Gibson et al. 2006).

The major questions about these ﬂux ropes are how
they are formed and how they are initiated to produce
an eruption. Sigmoid eruptions are interpreted by two
kinds of observational models based on two diﬀerent view
points of the same structure as sheared arcade and ﬂux
rope. The ﬁrst kind of models assume that the sigmoid
is composed of sheared and twisted core ﬁeld in the AR
and the internal/external runaway tethercutting recon-
nection is responsible for sigmoid to arcade transforma-
tion and eruption (Antiochos et al. 1999; Moore et al.
2001). On the other hand, the second kind of models ar-
gue that the evolution of a sigmoidal AR with ﬂare and
CME is explained by a twisted magnetic ﬂux rope in the
form of ﬁlament structure that emerges and equilibrates
with the overlying coronal magnetic ﬁeld structure (Gib-
son et al. 2006). van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989) pro-
posed a scenario of ﬂux rope formation from a sheared
arcade where ﬂux cancellation occurs by slow shearing
and converging regions about the polarity inversion line
(PIL).

From the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) point of view,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Vasantharaju et al

the ﬂux rope is in equilibrium under the balance of mag-
netic pressure in the ﬂux rope and the magnetic tension
of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld. If the twist number in-
creases to some critical value, then kink instability would
occur (Hood & Priest 1979; T¨or¨ok et al. 2004). If the de-
cay index of the background ﬁeld, in which the MFR is
embedded, is larger than some critical value, torus in-
stability can occur (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Aulanier et al.
2010). However, in general both ideal MHD instability
and magnetic reconnection mechanisms are responsible
for release of magnetic energy by triggering the ﬂux rope
eruption successfully (Forbes 2000). These models are
similar to catastrophe model where the ﬂux rope would
lose equilibrium after reaching a critical height, form-
ing a current sheet beneath it, connecting the post-CME
loops to the CME ejecta (Lin et al. 2005; Bemporad et al.
2006), as predicted by both the classical CSHKP ﬂare
model (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974;
Kopp & Pneuman 1976) and other CME models (e.g.,
Lin & Forbes 2000; Chen et al. 2007).

Generally, the catastrophe model explain eﬃciently
the observed CME-ﬂare associated eruptions rather than
ﬂare-less CME events. Quite recently Song et al. (2013)
studied the energy release mechanisms in a sample of 13
ﬂare-less CME events, which are associated with promi-
nence eruptions originated from relatively weak ﬁeld
quiet-Sun regions. They found that the ideal MHD ﬂux-
rope instability plays a major role in magnetic energy re-
lease process while the magnetic reconnection plays the
minor role. This manuscript presents a comprehensive
study of formation, initiation and eruption of a sigmoid
from a weak ﬁeld AR. We try to understand the weak
eruption via probing questions like 1) Under what con-
ditions it became eruptive?, 2) what conditions made it
weak (in terms of CME speed, energy and associated
ﬂare class)?, and 3) How are the observed consequences
diﬀerent from strong eruption events?. In section 2, we
described the observational data. The results are pre-
sented in section 3 and summarized with conclusion in
section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA
The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. (2012)) on-board Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. (2012)) produces full-disc Extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) images in 10 wavelength bands at
a high cadence of 12 seconds and pixel size of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).6.
For the present study, we used the images obtained in
94˚A(Fe XVIII; T∼6.4MK), 131˚A(Fe XXI ;T∼10MK),
171˚A(Fe IX;T ∼0.6MK), 193 ˚A( Fe XII; T∼1.6MK &
Fe XXIV ;T∼20MK) and 304˚A( He-II;T∼0.05MK) wave-
lengths. To increase the contrast and signal-to-noise ra-
tio, we added ﬁve consecutive images to give the ca-
dence of 1-minute. The corresponding photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld observations are obtained from the He-
lioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.
(2012)) on board SDO. Both line-of-sight(LOS) and vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld measurements obtained at a cadence
of 12 minutes are used in this study. Vector data set
is hmi.sharp cea 720s series, which provides automat-
ically selected cutouts of active regions (space weather
HMI active region patches; SHARPs − see Bobra et al.
(2014)) in the form of Lambert cylindrical equal-area

(CEA) projection. Using the cut-out image processing
aide provided by JSOC Stanford website, the cut-outs
of LOS full-disk magnetogram data were used and then
these cut-outs are corrected for the area foreshortening
that occurs away from central meridian. The CME was
observed in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectro-
metric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. (1995))
on board SOHO, which consists of two optical systems,
C2 (2.2 − 6.0 R(cid:12)) and C3 (4 − 32 R(cid:12)).

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Active region NOAA 11942 ﬁrst appeared as the com-
pact region on January 1, 2014 in the eastern limb of
northern hemisphere. It was of Mount Wilson class-αγ
gradually evolving to class-βγ while moving across the
disk towards the west-limb and ﬁnally revert to class-
αγ before it decays on 10 January 2014. During the
disk passage, AR 11942 possessed an inverse-S sigmoidal
structure in EUV wavebands during its decay phase on
6-7th January 2014. The fragmentation and dispersion
of both north and south polarity regions lead to the for-
mation of sigmoid and it supported the ﬁlament at initial
stages. In due course the ﬁlament got separated from sig-
moid and started to rise upwards leading to a CME with
association of small X-ray ﬂare. The inverse-S shape in-
dicates the region has left-handed chirality or negative
helicity (Pevtsov 2002). Motivated by these observa-
tions, we studied the formation of sigmoidal structure,
driving and triggering mechanisms of the eruption from
sigmoidal AR.

3.0.1. Slow evolution and build-up of sigmoidal loop

structure

To present the typical evolution of AR 11942, we used
characteristic snapshots of AIA 171 ˚A on diﬀerent days
overlaid with corresponding LOS magnetogram contours,
shown in the bottom panels of Figure 1. The magne-
tograms are shown in the top panels. The AR consists
of leading negative and following positive polarity mim-
icking a bipolar conﬁguration. We noticed from these
panels that the positive and negative polarity regions
were in compact and less dispersed phase on January
3, 2014, and the coronal loop structure in AIA 171 ˚A im-
ages indicates a simple potential ﬁeld conﬁguration (ﬁrst
column of Figure 1). Further on January 4 (second col-
umn of Figure 1), the positive polarity regions start to
diﬀuse towards the southern direction whereas negative
polarity elements start to undergo further fragmentation
and dispersion towards west. This process as a whole
manifests converging and shearing motion of magnetic
patches in the interfering region of the leading nega-
tive and following positive polarities (See also Figure 2).
While this process continues further till January 5 (third
column of Figure 1), the AR loops became increasingly
sheared with a morphology of inverse-S shape as being
the combination of two inverse-J shaped loops joining at
the middle. During this process, we also noticed emer-
gence of positive magnetic ﬂux near the negative polarity
region towards west which further complicates the mag-
netic topology of the AR. We can see the diﬀerence of
simple potential conﬁguration on January 3 and that of
inverse S-shape sigmoidal loop structure on January 5.

build-up of inverse-S shape sheared arcade from potential like loop structure on January 3. Bz-contours at ±100G are overlaid to identify
the polarity of loop foot points.

Further to study the converging and shearing ﬂux mo-
tions, we derived horizontal velocity ﬁeld by diﬀeren-
tial aﬃne velocity estimator (DAVE; Schuck 2006) tech-
nique. We use HMI LOS magnetogram maps at 12
minute cadence.
In order to highlight large-scale and
long term ﬂow pattern, the velocity maps are averaged
over 4 hours. These ﬂow velocities are shown in Figure 2.
Vectors indicate the direction of ﬂux motion within a re-
gion of polarity outlined by contour at ±100G . We nor-
malized the magnitude of velocity vectors to 0.6 km/s
such that the features which move at far less velocity
will be clearly visible. From the Figure 2a, the velocity
ﬁeld in the negative polarity show a ﬂow pattern towards
east and that in positive polarity indicates a ﬂow pattern
towards west. These ﬂow patterns around the PIL of re-
gion manifests shearing motion. This motion is known
to eﬀectively transform the initial potential conﬁguration
to sheared arcade, which then undergo reconnection at
the converging region to form sigmoidal conﬁgurations
(Amari et al. 2003).
In the subsequent instances, the
velocity pattern in both the polarities indicate ﬂows are
converging towards each other (within the orange oval).
These motions about the PIL causes the ﬂux cancellation
process. Chae et al. (2004) reported that submerging op-
posite polarities are the sites of cancelling magnetic fea-
tures. Besides the sigmoid formation by the slow shear
and converging motions, a ﬁlament channel is observed
in AIA 304 ˚A images from January 5, which implies a

ﬂux rope topology where dipped ﬁeld lines support the
ﬁlament material.

3.1. Filament initiation and onset of main phase

reconnection

In Figure 3a, the ﬁlament is seen to be supported
by the sigmoidal structure. This ﬁlament channel ex-
hibits some dynamical activity early on January 6, co-
temporal with the net ﬂux decrease by ﬂux cancellation
process. During this period, the ﬁlament channel ap-
pears to rise higher in height, especially the north lobe
segment. These observations imply that continued shear-
ing and converging motion of the ﬂuxes lead to the onset
of ﬁlament rise motion by the tether-cutting reconnec-
tion from around 05:35 UT. In ﬁgure (3b), the rising
ﬁlament is captured in AIA 304 ˚A image at 17:10UT.
After 21:00UT the ﬁlament becomes invisible to AIA
304 ˚A passband as it had risen to higher altitude and
eventually erupts at 21:32 UT.

The morphological transformation in the sheared ar-
cade during the ﬁlament eruption(i.e.,from 20:00UT to
01:00UT on January 6) is demonstrated with AIA EUV
observations in Figure 4. The ﬁrst and second row im-
ages are from two hotter passbands AIA 94 ˚A( 6.4MK)
and AIA 131 ˚A( 10MK) respectively, whereas third
row images are from relatively cooler passband AIA
171 ˚A( 0.6MK). The bundle of two sheared inverse J-

The derived velocities from HMI LOS Bz (12 minute cadence) are averaged over 4 hours to enhance the large scale motion of the ﬂuxes.
The arrows indicate direction of motion and their length is proportional to magnitude to a maximum of 0.6 km/s. Both positive and
negative polarities in each panel move towards each other and interact by converging motion in a region enclosed by orange oval. In all
panels, axis units are in pixels of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48).

shaped loops are evident in the second column images
of Figure 4 and also traced in AIA 131˚A image (middle
row) as yellow dashed lines. These two loops eventually
get reconnected to form the long Inverse S shaped loop
as depicted in the subsequent 3rd and 4th column images
of Figure 4. Observations of continuous ﬂux cancellation

by converging and shearing motions suggests the tether-
cutting reconnection model (Moore & Labonte 1980),
where the inverse J-shaped ﬁeld lines come closer and
reconnect to form long inverse S-shaped loops. Due to
this tether-cutting reconnection, we expect that the sig-
moidal ﬁeld lines will be heated to higher temperatures

(>2-20MK) and the resultant enhanced emission is cap-
tured in hotter AIA 94˚A, AIA 131˚A and AIA 193˚A pass
bands, whereas the cooler AIA 171˚A pass-band couldn’t
detect the emission enhancement from the heated plasma
from reconnection. This scenario is pointed by white ar-
rows on second column images. From the AIA movies of
94˚A and 131˚A, we observed the initial enhanced bright-
ness due to reconnection at 21:32 UT on January 6, which
is presumed to be the time of onset of main phase recon-
nection between two inverse J-shaped loops. The addi-
tion of axial ﬂux strengthen the ﬂux-rope and is seen
as expanding CME in the north-west side, which is not
visible directly in EUV images but clearly in the run-
ning diﬀerence images of AIA 171˚A. Further, the repet-
itive reconnection continues in the sheared arcade and
the emission of resultant heated plasma is suggested to
be responsible for brightening of the observed transient
sigmoidal structure.

3.1.1. Flare-ribbon velocity and reconnection rate

We observed the ﬂare-ribbons and their separation
from 21:40 UT on January 6 to about 01:00UT on 7
January in AIA 304 ˚A passband images. To track the

ﬂare-ribbon motion, we used the AIA 304 ˚A images at
the cadence of 2 minute and determined the ribbon sepa-
ration velocities using slices at diﬀerent directions along
ribbon motion as shown in ﬁgure (3c). The stack-up of
one such slices(AB) with time is shown in top panel of
ﬁgure 5. To smooth out ﬂuctuations due to measure-
ment uncertainties, spline smoothing was applied to the
distance data points which are identiﬁed to be tracked
front edge of the ﬂare-ribbon. The spline ﬁt to the ﬂare-
ribbon distance proﬁle is marked with blue “+” sym-
bols. The required temporal evolution of the apparent
ribbon velocity was determined as the time derivative of
the spline-smoothed distance proﬁles and is shown as an
inset(green) in top panel of Figure 5.

Forbes & Priest (1984) and Forbes & Lin (2000)
showed that the local reconnection rate i.e., the rate at
which magnetic ﬁeld lines are carried into the reconnec-
tion site, is given by the coronal electric ﬁeld E at the re-
connection site. They derived a simple relation between
the local reconnection rate and the apparent ﬂare-ribbon
separation speed v. It is given by E = Bnv, where Bn
is vertical component of magnetic ﬁeld underlying ﬂare-
ribbon location. To determine the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld strength, ﬁrst we generated the ﬂare-ribbon mask by

AIA 304 ˚A image. The masks are generated at a ca-
dence of 2 minute for every AIA 304 ˚A image. One such
example mask is shown in panel 3d. Later the masks
are multiplied with the near simultaneous co-registered
LOS magnetograms to get the underlying magnetic ﬁeld
swept by ﬂare-ribbon front. To reduce the uncertainty,
we excluded the magnetogram pixels having value less
than 20 G in the computation of absolute mean of pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The temporal proﬁles of mean
magnetic ﬁeld strength and local reconnection rate are
plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 5 . The velocity of
ﬂare-ribbon (one moving towards west) and local recon-
nection rate reach their maximum values of 11.52 kms−1
and 2.14 Vcm−1 respectively at 21:47 UT(±1minute) and
is co-temporal with ﬂare peak time. Our results are com-
parable with the maximum reconnection rates obtained
for C-class eruptive ﬂares in Hinterreiter et al. (2018) and
lesser than the maximum reconnection rates obtained for
strong eruptive ﬂares (Miklenic et al. 2007; Hinterreiter
et al. 2018).

3.2. Post eruption evolution and the CME
3.2.1. Light Curves
Evolution of GOES soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux in 1-8˚A and
the light curves of AR 11942 obtained from AIA images
of diﬀerent wavelengths are shown in the top and bot-
tom panels of Figure 6 respectively. The GOES SXR
background is already above C-class due to the X-ray
ﬂux from other ARs and there was a sudden small ﬂux
enhancement corresponding to the EUV ﬂux from AR
11942 at 21:32 UT(black vertical dotted line). Unlike
many eruptive ﬂares, this SXR enhancement as C1.0 ﬂare
remains an hour and is regarded as weak ﬂare compared
to the long EUV activity. A time delay between peak
emissions of diﬀerent EUV wavelengths were noticeable
from bottom panel of Figure 6. All these light curves
were normalized to their maximum intensity and were
vertically shifted by some amount to avoid overlapping
of these curves.

The time proﬁle of AIA 94˚A starts rising from
21:32UT and reaches gradually to peak emission at

shaped loops were clearly captured in AIA 94˚A and AIA
131˚A. 131 ˚A ﬁlter covers Fe VIII (LogT ≈ 5.6), Fe XX
(LogT ≈ 7.1), and Fe XXIII (LogT ≈ 7.2) which are
sensitive to low temperature at 0.6 MK and high tem-
perature at 10 MK as well. The 131˚A has peak emission
from the AR at 2:54 UT on January 7 and is delayed
by 130 minutes compared to AIA 94˚A. The additional

heating provided by the slow magnetic reconnection in
the gradual phase creates the delayed peak emission in
AIA131 (Liu et al. 2015). Light curve of AIA 304 shows
an impulsive rise and reaches quickly to its peak at Jan-
uary 6, 22:40 UT even before AIA 94 light curve. This
shows that chromosphere and transition region immedi-
ately responded to heating to at least 1MK (Chamberlin

et al. 2012) and its wider peak is accounted for by dif-
ferent cooling timescales of the heated coronal loops. A
dip in the AIA 171 proﬁle during main phase reconnec-
tion is mainly due to the hot reconnection loops which
are opaque to the cooler passband of AIA 171(Dai et al.
2018). Later these loops slowly started to appear in AIA
171 and warm coronal emission peaks at 2:52UT on Jan-
uary 7, which is mainly due to the long cooling process
of the late-phase loops as proposed in Liu et al. (2013).
It is worth to note that the AIA 171 and AIA 131 peak
emissions (both AIA131 and AIA171 passbands are sen-

sitive to cooler temperature of ≈ 0.6M K) got delayed
by about 130 minutes compared to AIA 94˚A . Also, such
time delays in peak emissions of light curves of strong
eruptions (occurred from ARs for example Vemareddy
& Zhang (2014)) are quite smaller (≈ 10min). Though
studies like (Liu et al. 2015; Dai et al. 2018) also ob-
served the large time delays between peak emissions in
EUV light curves of AR during conﬁned ﬂare events, we
need more comparative studies between strong and weak
eruptive ARs to verify our result.

3.2.2. CME detection
The AR produces an eruption after the formation of
sigmoid. As the eruption occurred on-disk, the projec-
tion eﬀect reduces the contrast and consequently ham-
pers the faint eruption on-disk to be seen clearly in
EUV/AIA intensity images. But on applying running
diﬀerence technique to AIA 171˚A images, we can ob-
serve the propagation of the CME ﬂux rope unambigu-
ously. Figure 7(a-d) represents the sequential expansion
and eruption of CME from the source AR in north-west
direction. To ﬁlter out high frequency features and to
improve contrast, we apply high degree of smoothing to
the 5 minute running diﬀerence images of AIA 171˚A. The
traced grey line in the panel 7c represents the stretching
and expanding CME front, while still having connections
to its source AR.

Panel 7d represents the post-eruption scenario, as the
CME moves away from the limb the stretched loops
shrink to form the cusp shaped structure below. This
eruption scenario matches with the catastrophic CME
model. This leads to the stretching up of overlying loops
and as a result opposite ﬁeld loop lines started getting
close to each other to a cusp-shape structure. As the
loops came in contact with each other, the current sheet
forms in between and the subsequent reconnection in the
current sheet leads to form post-CME loops below. Pan-
els 7(e-f) display the observed CME in LASCO C2 and
C3 FOV respectively.

3.2.3. CME kinematics
We performed on-disk kinematic analysis of the CME
using 5 minute running diﬀerence images of AIA 171˚A.
On careful inspection of running diﬀerence images, we
identiﬁed the leading edge of CME ﬂuxrope and placed
a slit along its ascending direction. Since the eruption
occurred on-disk, the height refers to the projected dis-
tance on the disk from the center of the sun. Thus the
resulting on-disk velocity of CME ﬂuxrope is also ap-
proximated. The space-time image is shown in top panel
of Figure 8 and blue “+” symbols in the image repre-
sents ascending CME front. We used a model contain-
ing the linear term to treat the slow-rise phase and ex-
ponential term to account the rapid-acceleration phase
as described in Cheng et al. (2013) and is given by
h(t) = C0e(t−t0)/τ + C1(t − t0) + C2, where h(t) is height
at a given time t, and τ , t0, C0, C1, and C2 are free coef-
ﬁcients. This model has two distinct advantages, ﬁrstly
a single function describes the two phases of eruption ef-
fectively and secondly it provides a convenient method to
determine the time of onset of rapid-acceleration phase
(Tc). The onset of rapid-acceleration phase is deﬁned as
the time at which the exponential component of velocity
equals to its linear component as Tc = τ ln(C1τ /C0) + t0.
We used mpfit.pro to ﬁt the height-time data. From
the ﬁt, Tc is determined to be 21:51UT (indicated by
vertical dashed line in bottom panel of Figure 8).

Further, the numerical derivative method is applied
to calculate the velocity and acceleration proﬁles (e.g.,
Zhang et al. (2001, 2004)). The derived velocity (blue)
and acceleration (red) proﬁles are over-plotted in bot-
tom panel of Figure 8. The duration of slow-rise phase
is between 21:32 - 21:51UT with an average velocity of
26 km/s. By 21:51 UT, the CME front acquired fast-

rise motion and velocity(acceleration) increased from
36 km/s(14ms−2) to 206km/s(134ms−2) in 54 minutes,
with an average acceleration of ≈ 55ms−2. These are
quite diﬀerent from strong eruption cases, for example
Zhang et al. (2012) showed the CME ﬂux rope in slow-
rise phase has the average velocity of about 60 km/s
and in fast-rise phase, it reached the terminal velocity
of about 700km/s in 6 minutes with an average accelera-
tion of 1600ms−2. Similarly in another example of quite
stronger eruption event presented in Cheng et al. (2014),
the CME ﬂux rope had average velocity of about 35km/s
during its slow-rise phase and in rapid-acceleration phase
it reached the terminal velocity of about 300km/s in 23
minutes with an average acceleration of 200ms−2. Thus
the eruption under study is quite a slower one and we
opine that, the slow-rise phase of CME ﬂux-rope is due
to the tether-cutting reconnection and the fast-rise phase
is accounted for by the catastrophic behaviour of the
ﬂux rope system and/or torus instability (D´emoulin &
Aulanier 2010; Chen et al. 2018).
It will be discussed
further in the section 4.

The sigmoid eruption is observed as CME visible in
SOHO/LASCO which the CME catalog listed as two
CMEs appearing in LASCO C2 ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) ini-
tially at 23:12UT and 23:24UT at position angles 275 and
300 degrees respectively. We believe that these could
be diﬀerent parts of the single CME structure, named
as part1 and part2. The part1 was identiﬁed to be ex-
panding CME front as observed in AIA 171˚A diﬀerence
images of Figure 7(a-d)(also refer animation) and fur-
ther it is tracked by coronagraph C3 until January 7 at
00:42 UT up to a height of 9 R(cid:12). The part2 was tracked
by coronagraph C3 until January 7 at 8:00 UT upto a
height of 22 R(cid:12). The height−time plot available at the
SOHO/LASCO CME catalog shows the linear speeds of
part1 and part2 are 722 km/s and 442 km/s with their
angular widths 15 degree and 100 degrees respectively.
Gopalswamy et al. (2001) found that the average speed of
CMEs associated with decameter-hectometric radio type
II bursts to be 960 km/s and the average width to be 66
degree.
In other words, the strong geo-eﬀective CMEs
are those having speed and width greater than 960 km/s
and 66◦ respectively. Therefore, the CME event under
study is considered as slow/weak CME.

3.2.4. Relaxation of sheared core ﬁeld

Past Observations (Sterling et al. 2000; Pevtsov 2002;
Liu et al. 2010) have shown that eruptive ARs, which
initially display a sigmoidal structure, evolve into a post-
eruption phase that consists of ﬁeld lines with a cusp-like
shape. The newly formed ﬁeld lines of sigmoidal struc-
ture are highly sheared, containing much non-potential
magnetic energy. The reconnection occurs in sheared
core ﬁeld (Moore et al. 2001) helps in the release of such
contained free magnetic energy. The dissipation of free
magnetic energy causes the sheared ﬁeld to relax, giving
rise to the contraction of loops(Ji et al. 2007). Such a
process of relaxation of sheared ﬁeld lines is represented
by typical AIA 94 ˚A passband images. By 01:00 UT, the
CME had moved away from the sheared core ﬁeld, the
enhanced brightness in the core ﬁeld indicates the contin-
uous reconnections allowing the long sheared ﬁeld lines
to relax as seen in EUV observations (ﬁgure not shown).

3.3. Thermal Evolution
Emission measure and thermal structure of sigmoid
is explored by applying Diﬀerential Emission Measure
(DEM) analysis to six EUV passbands of SDO/AIA. We
used xrt dem iterative2.pro in Solar Software with
modiﬁcations to work with AIA data. The code was ini-
tially designed for Hinode/X-ray Telescope data (Golub
et al. 2004; Weber et al. 2004). However, Cheng et al.
(2012) tested this code extensively on AIA data by study-
ing the diﬀerent thermal properties of multi-structure
CME. The DEM maps of sigmoid are constructed and
the emission measure (EM) and DEM weighted average
temperature ( ¯T ) are derived using the following deﬁni-
tions,

where integration is performed in temperature limits
of 5.7 < LogT < 7.1. In Figure 9, we plot the maps of
EM and ¯T representing the distribution of total emission
measure and average temperature of sigmoidal structure
in middle and bottom panels respectively, while the cor-
responding AIA 131˚A images are displayed in top panel.
The distribution of EM and ¯T in sigmoidal structure is
higher than that of the quiet region surrounding it in
all panels. As the magnetic reconnection had already

started at 21:32UT, the enhanced brightness is clearly
seen in AIA 131˚A image taken at 22:00UT at the re-
connection site. Similarly in the same time slab, the
enhanced EM and ¯T distribution is seen in the reconnec-
tion region. The released energy due to magnetic recon-
nection heats up the plasma resulting in the emission.
At 23:00UT, the hot post-eruption loops forms below re-
sulting in increase of temperature and EM in and around
those loop lines. At 00:15UT on January 7, the EM and
¯T distribution reaches maximum in and/or around bright
reconnected loops. The EM reaches the maximum value
of 1029cm−5 and average temperature ( ¯T ) reaches upto
107.09 K. However, the maps are scaled optimally for bet-
ter contrast. After 1:00UT, the decrease in the EM and
¯T distribution starts as evident in time slab of 3:00 UT.
The DEM reconstruction is an ill-posed problem and
several errors arise from uncertainties in response func-
tion, background determination, radiative transfer eﬀects
etc., (Judge 2010). Hence we concentrated on the tempo-
ral variation of EM and ¯T rather than their exact values.
We estimated the average values of EM and ¯T of the
sigmoidal structure with the same ﬁeld-of-view as shown
in the Figure 9 during the time-period from 21:30UT
to 04:00UT at an interval of 15 minute. The temporal
evolution of these curves are shown in Figure 10. As
the CME moves away from the solar disk (by 22:50UT),
the hot post-eruption loops form underneath. Due to
this, the temperature and EM curves start to rise fur-

ther after the eruption. The EM curve in black and ¯T
curve in blue, both follows the same trend reaching their
peaks at 00:15UT as indicated by the vertical dashed line
in Figure 10. After reaching peak, the average ¯T curve
shows the gradual declining phase, whereas the EM curve
shows the steady phase till 02:00UT and then declines.
This shows that the emission from cooling loops are quite
strong enough and as comparable to that of hotter loop
structures during that time period. Also, these curves
follows the light curves of sigmoid as described in previ-
ous section 3.2.1.

3.4. Evolution of photospheric magnetic parameters

We studied the temporal evolution of diﬀerent mag-
netic measures for 3 days ( 2.4 days prior to eruption)
using the HMI vector magnetograms(SHARP series) at
the cadence of 12 minute. Generally the magnetogram
measures are area-dependent, hence these parameters
are computed by choosing an area within the active re-
gion(AR) including eruption region with minimum ﬂux-
imbalance(i.e., net ﬂux/total unsigned ﬂux < 3%). More-
over, a careful manual inspection of ﬁeld lines connectiv-
ity in AIA 171 ˚A images results in the exclusion of cer-
tain regions of AR connecting to neighbouring ARs and
thereby restricting the area only to the eruption region
with minimum ﬁeld lines connecting outside of it. The

area enclosed by the white dashed rectangle in Figure 11e
is used to compute the following magnetogram measures.
The total unsigned ﬂux of AR is deﬁned as Φ =
(cid:80) |Bz|dA , where dA is the area of an observation pixel.
The ﬂux is computed from the pixels having magnetic
ﬁeld strength higher than 50 G. Since the measurement
error is within 15G, we have chosen the threshold three
times larger than that and hence the error in our estima-
tion of ﬂux is negligible. The temporal evolution of net
ﬂux is shown in Figure 11a. The frequent emergence and
cancellation of ﬂuxes are evident in AR during its disk
passage from January 4 to middle of January 7. Notable
observations are from 4:00UT on January 6 (as indicated
by vertical dashed line in Figure 11), where the net ﬂux
starts decreasing corresponding to ﬂux cancellation and
such decreasing continues till the onset (21:32UT; indi-
cated by vertical grey line in Figure 11) of the main phase
reconnection. During this time period, the ﬁlament ex-
hibits dynamical evolution and rise motion initiated from
05:35 UT. The regions of ﬂux cancellation during this
time period are studied in section 3.0.2. Careful scrutiny
of simultaneous observations of magnetograms and AIA
images (observed several episodes of EUV brightenings
and also converging motions in small regions) led to se-
lect two sub-regions namely SR1 and SR2 as indicated in
Figure 11(e-g). The net ﬂux in these regions is plotted
in the bottom panels, which show continuous decreasing
evolution. We thus suggest from these observational ev-
idences that the persistent slow shearing and converging
motions about the PIL played prime role in the cancel-
lation of ﬂuxes leading to the initiation and eruption of
the sigmoid conﬁguration (Green & Kliem 2009; Green
et al. 2011; Savcheva et al. 2012; Vemareddy & Mishra
2015; Vemareddy 2017b).

The vertical current density is computed as Jz =
1/µ0(∂By/∂x − ∂Bx/∂y), where Bx and By represents
the horizontal component of magnetic ﬁeld. For a given
polarity, the current distribution contains both positive
and negative values. We examined the degree of net cur-
rent neutralization (NCN) in each polarity by obtaining
the ratio of Direct Current (DC) and Return Current
(RC) (T¨or¨ok et al. 2014). The dominance of the signed
currents decides the chirality of the magnetic ﬁeld and
so DC is also considered as the dominant current and
RC as the non-dominant current. The DC and RC are
computed for each polarity by integrating current density
values of diﬀerent signs separately. This has been done
only for those pixels whose Bx, By values are larger than
150 G and Bz values are larger than 50 G to minimize the
error in computation of currents. The ratio of DC and
RC indicates the extent of departure from net current
neutralization in any polarity. While selecting the inte-
gration area, we have not excluded the non-eruptive ﬂux
completely in AR so the values of |DC/RC| of any polar-
ity at any time interval are expected to be quite smaller
than the actual values which are estimated by restricting
the integration to the foot point area of eruptions (Liu
et al. 2017; Vemareddy 2017a). We found DC is positive
in south polarity and negative in north polarity. The
temporal evolution of |DC/RC| values in both polarity
regions are plotted in Figure 11b. The |DC/RC| values
in south polarity region maintained well above unity. Al-
though the evolution in north polarity has similar trend,
the |DC/RC| values ﬂuctuates for the fact that the hori-
zontal ﬁeld in this polarity are not strong and the numer-
ical diﬀerentiation may have artifacts rather to represent
the reliable current distribution. The non-neutralization
current implies the eruptive behavior of AR in terms of

ﬂux rope models.

Average alpha (αav), the proxy represents the twist
of magnetic ﬁeld lines in an AR, is computed using the
equation given by αav = (cid:80)[Jz(x, y)Bz(x, y)/|Bz(x, y)|]
(Pevtsov et al. 1994; Hagino & Sakurai 2004). The errors
are estimated from the least-squared regression plot of Bz
and Jz (Vemareddy et al. 2012). The temporal evolution
of αav along with its error bars are shown in Figure 11c.
The twist of ﬁeld lines starts increasing from January
4 till early hours of January 6, consistent with coronal
observations of the sigmoidal structure formation over a
time scale of days as described in Figure 1. As soon as
the ﬂux cancellation starts i.e., at 4:00 UT on January 6,
αav decreases as the signature of disappearing ﬂux from
cancellation.

Further, the total magnetic energy and potential en-
ergy in the coronal ﬁeld is estimated using a Virial the-
orem equation (Chandrasekhar 1961; Molodensky 1974;
(cid:82) (xBx + yBy)Bzdxdy. Since the
Low 1982) as E = 1
4π
photospheric ﬁeld is not force-free, the energy estimate
by using this equation serves as proxy for energy con-
tent in the AR. Then proxy for magnetic free energy
is estimated by taking the diﬀerence of total magnetic
energy and potential energy. We used the whole AR for
potential-ﬁeld extrapolation but energy estimations were

done for the region within the white dashed rectangle as
shown in Figure 11e. As seen in panel 11d, the free en-
ergy decreases corresponding to the increasing αav till
January 6. This may be due to emerging ﬂux which
increases the potential energy dominantly than the non-
potential amount in the total energy. During the mag-
netic ﬂux cancellation period (4:00UT - 21:32UT, 6 Jan),
the free energy remains almost same with some undula-
tions. It is important to note that the free energy during
small C-class ﬂare event is small and the ﬁeld variations
at diﬀerent sub-regions camouﬂage the ﬁeld contribut-
ing to the reconnecting ﬂux. In such cases the expected
variation of the free-energy is diﬃcult to realize besides
the intrinsic problems with the noisy transverse ﬁeld ob-
servations.
In conclusion, this study suggests that the
energy release proceeded in a much long time duration,
manifesting the onset of ﬁlament rise and eventual erup-
tion driven by converging and canceling ﬂux in the pho-
tosphere.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we investigated the sigmoidal eruption
from AR 11942 on January 6, 2014 leading to CME ac-
companied by a weak ﬂare. We presented the comprehen-
sive study of morphological transformation from simple

bipolar conﬁguration to complicated inverse sigmoidal
AR, along with its initiation and eruption mechanisms
using the multi-wavelength EUV observations from AIA
and (vector) magnetograms from HMI. The ﬂare and
CME are detected by ﬂare-ribbon evolution and running
diﬀerence images respectively.

Initially the AR is compact and bipolar in nature, and
evolved to sheared conﬁguration consisting of inverse-J
loops over a couple of days (Figure 1). Magnetic ﬂux
dispersion, shearing and converging motion are observed
to play signiﬁcant role in the development of sigmoidal
structure hosting a ﬁlament channel as inferred from
EUV observations of AIA. Further such evolution leads
to ﬂux cancellation and net ﬂux decrease starts early
on January 6. Consequently, the ﬁlament channel ini-
tiated to upward motion from 5:35 UT on January 6,
which was suggested for tether-cutting reconnection of
inverse J-loops forming continuous inverse S-loops as a
ﬂux rope (Moore et al. 2001; Amari et al. 2003). While
tether-cutting reconnection continues under the converg-
ing and shearing motions, the sigmoidal structure losses
equilibrium at 21:32 UT leading to CME and weak ﬂare.

Forbes & Isenberg (1991) indicates that as ﬂux cancel-
lation continues near the magnetic neutral line, the ﬂux
rope embedded in a bipolar ﬁeld rises smoothly till it
reaches a critical point, at which the ﬂux rope presents
a catastrophic behavior, i.e., after the gradual accumu-
lation of magnetic energy, the ﬂux-rope system transits
from a stable state to an unstable one containing a cur-
rent sheet. The catastrophe model of solar eruptions
suggests the catastrophic loss of mechanical equilibrium
in the magnetic conﬁguration (e.g., Forbes 2000; Priest
& Forbes 2002; Lin 2004).

Figure 7c shows when the ﬂux rope rises, overlying
loops gets stretched and the inward motion of anti-
parallel magnetic ﬁeld lines lead to the formation of thin
current sheet, where the magnetic reconnection sends
large amount of the reconnected ﬂux and plasma out-
ward, accounting for the rapid expansion of the ejecta
(plasma blobs or plasmoids or CME) and the hot shell
surrounding it (Lin 2004). Here the smoothness of the
observed eruption is accounted for by the slow recon-
nection process (local reconnection rate range 0.01 −
2.14V cm−1) in the current sheet underneath the ﬂux

rope. Depending on the amount of reconnected ﬂux, the
magnitude of ﬂare emission is visible in X-rays. Lesser
the hoop/self force in the ﬂux rope, lesser the coronal dis-
turbance, slower is the CME and its impact. We believe
that a small number of inverse J-shaped loops are par-
ticipated in the tether-cutting reconnection resulting in
the weak ﬂux rope and the rest of sheared arcade relaxed
in the post phase of the eruption. This is clear from the
canceling/converging small ﬂux regions with weak PIL.
Accordingly, a mild SXR enhancement is observed due
to slow reconnection rate followed by a dominant EUV
emission in the late phase of eruption. So, studying such
weak events are important to know the connection of
photospheric evolution and origin of the Earth-aﬀecting
cases.

Further, D´emoulin & Aulanier (2010) and Kliem et al.
(2014) showed that the critical conditions for the catas-
trophic loss of equilibrium also satisfy the torus insta-
bility criterion. The rapid decaying of overlying mag-
netic ﬁeld with height referred as torus instability and

∂Bh
is measured with decay index n(z) = − z
∂z , where
Bh
z is the geometrical height from the bottom boundary
and Bh is the horizontal ﬁeld strength. We computed
the background ﬁeld in the entire volume of AR by po-
tential magnetic ﬁeld approximation. In Figure 12, the
n(z) with height in solid curve and Bh in dashed line
are plotted. A constant value of ncrit = 1.5 is assumed
as critical decay index which corresponds to a critical
height of 41.5 Mm. This agrees with the past studies
(Cheng et al. 2011; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014; Vasan-
tharaju et al. 2018), where the critical heights of eruptive
events falls below 42 Mm.

The magnetic non-potential parameters αav, NCN
show increasing behaviour with the formation of the sig-
moid by slow ﬂux motions for two days prior to the erup-
tion. However, the eruption occurs in a ﬂux cancellation
scenario by converging motions from 04:00 UT on Jan-
uary 4. During this period, the free energy exhibits al-
most steady behavior and αav have a decreasing proﬁle,
contrary to the cases of stronger eruptions (Vemareddy

the energy release is proceeded in a much long time dura-
tion, manifesting the onset of ﬁlament rise and eventual
eruption driven by converging and canceling ﬂux in the
photosphere.

The eruptions from large ARs are usually associated
with one or more clearly visible ﬂux ropes in hot AIA
channels. These are associated with sigmoids, ﬁla-
ments/prominences and erupts as CME with a strong X-
ray ﬂare (Vemareddy & Zhang 2014; Vemareddy 2017b;

small with a weak PIL ensuing in a slow reconnection
and yet able to produce a successful eruption.
