ABSTRACT
Jupiter’s atmosphere is enriched in C, N, S, P, Ar, Kr and Xe with respect to solar abundances
by a factor of ∼3. Gas Giant envelopes are mainly enriched through the dissolution of solids in the
atmosphere, and this constant enrichment factor is puzzling since several of the above elements are
not expected to have been in the solid phase in Jupiter’s feeding zone; most seriously, Ar and the
main carrier of N, N2, only condense at the very low temperatures, 21–26 K, associated with the outer
solar nebula. We propose that a plausible solution to the enigma of Jupiter’s uniform enrichment
pattern is that Jupiter’s core formed exterior to the N2 and Ar snowlines, beyond 30 au, resulting
in a Solar composition core in all volatiles heavier than Ne. During envelope accretion and planetes-
imal bombardment, some of the core mixed in with the envelope causing the observed enrichment
pattern. We show that this scenario naturally produces the observed atmosphere composition, even
with substantial pollution from N-poor pebble and planetesimal accretion in Jupiter’s ﬁnal feeding
zone. We note that giant core formation at large nebular radii is consistent with recent models of gas
giant core formation through pebble accretion, which requires the core to form exterior to Jupiter’s
current location to counter rapid inward migration during the core and envelope formation process.
If this scenario is common, gas giant core formation may account for many of the gaps observed in
protoplanetary disks between 10s and 100 au.

INTRODUCTION
The compositions of planets are linked to the chemical
conditions in the solar nebula. Since chemical conditions
change across the Nebula, a planet’s composition pro-
vides clues to its formation locations, and therefore to
its dynamical past (Dodson-Robinson et al. 2009; ¨Oberg
et al. 2011b; Ciesla et al. 2015). Of all known giant plan-
ets, Jupiter presents the most well-constrained compo-
sition because of in situ measurements by the Galileo
and Juno missions (Niemann et al. 1996; Bolton et al.
Importantly for this paper, the Galileo mission
2017).
revealed that C, N, S, P, Ar, Kr and Xe are all enriched
with respect to hydrogen compared to Solar abundances
(Owen et al. 1999). Whether O is enriched is unknown
– Galileo recorded a sub-Solar O abundance, but this
probably does not reﬂect the bulk O abundance. Gas
giant envelopes can become enriched through a num-
ber of processes – core erosion and mixing, accretion of
enriched gas, and dissolution of accreting pebbles and
planetesimals during envelope accretion or in the sub-
sequent clean-up stage (Hueso & Guillot 2003; Estrada
et al. 2017) – and some enrichment compared to Solar
abundances is therefore not surprising. What is surpris-
ing, however, is that all the above species are enriched
by approximately the same factor, ∼3.

This enrichment pattern is surprising because the ex-
pected solar nebula solid composition at ∼3–5 au, the
assumed formation location of Jupiter in most models

koberg@cfa.harvard.edu

(e.g. Gomes et al. 2005), is decidedly non-Solar, and most
models explain Jupiter’s enrichment by solid accretion
and dissolution . At 3–5 au, the solids are expected to
have been mainly composed of refractory material and
water ice (Ciesla et al. 2015), and therefore rich in oxy-
gen (O), sulfur (S) and phosphor (P) (Anders & Grevesse
1989; Asplund et al. 2009), but comparatively poor in
carbon (C), and very poor in nitrogen (N) and noble
gases (Ar, Kr and Xe), because important carbon car-
riers (CO2 and CO), and the dominant nitrogen carrier
(N2), as well as Xe, Kr, and Ar only freeze out further
out in the solar nebula. Accretion of such solids by a
gas giant would enrich its envelope strongly in O, S and
P, slightly in C, and not at all in N, Ar, Kr, and Xe, in
tension with the observed uniform factor of 3 enrichment
in all observed elements.

A possible solution to the presented tension is entrap-
ment of hyper-volatiles in water ice, which could main-
tain more C, and some N, Ar, Kr and Xe in solids at
5 au. Indeed several models have invoked clathration or
entrapment of hypervolatiles in amorphous water ice as
explanations of Jupiter’s enrichment pattern (Lunine &
Stevenson 1985; Owen et al. 1999; Gautier et al. 2001;
Hersant et al. 2004; Gautier & Hersant 2005; Mousis
et al. 2009). These models face some diﬃculties, how-
ever. First, they require large amounts of water ice to
entrap all other volatiles. This should result in an excess
enrichment in oxygen by a factor of a few compared to
other elements in Jupiter’s atmosphere, for which there
is so far no evidence. Second, entrapment of CO, N2

and Ar through clathration requires low nebular temper-
atures (Lunine & Stevenson 1985; Gautier et al. 2001),
40 K and less, which is diﬃcult to achieve in the Nebula
at 3–5 au if radiative heating is taken into account.

A possible solution to the diﬃculty of locally entrap-
ping hyper-volatiles at 3–5 au, is radial drift of cold peb-
bles from the outer solar nebula into Jupiter’s feeding
zone (e.g. Cuzzi & Zahnle 2004; ¨Oberg & Bergin 2016).
A similar idea underpins a recent study by Mousis et al.
(2019), who considers sublimation of entrapped volatiles
in inward-drifting amorphous water ice pebbles. The en-
riched gas is then accreted onto Jupiter. While this pro-
cess likely plays a role it should not lead to a uniform
enhancement in e.g. N and C. First, even at low tem-
peratures, N2 entrapment is ineﬃcient compared to CO
entrapment (e.g. Bar-Nun et al. 1985, 2007; Yokochi et al.
2012), which may explain low N2 abundances in comets
(Cochran et al. 2000; Cochran 2002; Rubin et al. 2015).
Second, the nebular model must be ﬁne-tuned to result
in a pebble population at 3–5 au that originates exclu-
sively from the cold, outer solar nebula region, rather
than from a range of radii, most of which would not al-
low for eﬃcient N2 entrapment.

A simpler explanation to Jupiter’s enrichment pattern
is that Jupiter’s core formed in the outer solar system,
beyond the N2 and Ar snowlines, from solids with Solar
ratios of all elements heavier than Ne. During envelope
accretion, and planetesimal and embryo impacts some of
the core was then mixed in with the envelope causing the
observed enrichment pattern. Such a formation scenario
may appear implausible at ﬁrst sight, but is supported
by both recent theory and observations. First, recent
models of core formation through pebble accretion in ac-
tively accreting disks only produce a Jupiter-sized planet
at Jupiter’s location if the core forms substantially fur-
ther out, at nebular radii >15 au (Bitsch et al. 2015,
2019; Pirani et al. 2019).
In earlier generations of gas
giant formation models, gas giant formation was limited
by long core formation and envelope accretion timescales
(e.g. Pollack et al. 1996; Hueso & Guillot 2003), which
typically exceeded 5 Myrs at 5 au. This is longer than
the typical 2-3 Myr lifetime of observed protoplanetary
disks (Mamajek 2009), and since timescales increase with
nebular radius, gas giant formation in the outer Solar
nebula seemed excluded. By contrast planet core for-
mation through pebble accretion is fast, and in recent
models the whole gas giant formation process – core for-
mation, envelope accretion, and inward migration – can
be completed in <1Myr. Even if core formation begins at
∼40 au the complete process takes only ∼2 Myrs (Bitsch
et al. 2015)

Second, Millimeter observations of analogs to our solar
nebula, i.e. of protoplanetary disks, have revealed that
gaps appear common at disk radii of 10–100 au (An-
drews et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2018). These gaps are
proposed to be associated with actively forming plan-
ets, and while other explanations exist, there is at least
one example where the there is supporting kinematic ev-
idence for protoplanets in the disk gaps (Teague et al.
2018; Pinte et al. 2018). If these gaps are indeed carved
out by planets, the gap widths and depths can be used
to constrain planet masses and this was recently done for
the DSHARP disk sample (Andrews et al. 2018; Zhang

et al. 2018). The result is that the gaps can be explained
by planets and planetary embryos of masses between ∼
10 Earth masses and a few Jupiter masses, suggestive
of that gas giant, or at least gas giant cores often begin
their existence at large disk radii.

The pebble accretion scenario has been used in one
study to explore whether it can indeed explain Jupiter’s
composition (Ali-Dib 2017), using a full-scale planet for-
mation and migration model. They found, that core for-
mation in the outer solar nebula could not alone account
for Jupiter’s nitrogen enrichment, probably because of
the location of the N2 snowline in their nebular model.
In this paper we take a simpler, toy model approach to
explore expected enrichment patterns in Jupiter’s enve-
lope when its core forms in the outer regions of the solar
nebula, with outer regions deﬁned with respect to the
N2 and Ar snowline locations. §2 introduces the nebu-
lar snowline model used throughout the paper. In §3 we
present our ﬁducial enrichment model and explore how
sensitive it is to core and envelope formation locations, as
well as to pollution during the clean-up stage. We discuss
the results in §4 before oﬀering some brief conclusions in
§5.

2. SOLAR NEBULA MODEL
2.1. Density and Temperature Structure
To explore the link between Jupiter’s core formation
location and its observed envelope composition, we con-
struct a simple, static toy model of the radial composi-
tion of solids and gas in the solar nebula midplane. We
follow the common assumption of radial power laws in
surface density and temperature (e.g. Lewis 1974; Chi-
ang & Youdin 2010):

ΣH = ΣH,1au

where ΣH is the column density, r is the disk radius in
au, ΣH,1au is the column density at 1 au, which we set
to 1500 g cm−2, and γ is the surface dense powerlaw in-
dex, which is typically assumed to be 3/2 for the solar
nebula (Chiang & Youdin 2010). The hydrogen nuclei
density nH is calculated from the surface density, and
the isothermal scale height H. Finally, Tmid is the mid-
plane temperature, and q is the temperature powerlaw
index. The latter is expected to be ∼ 3/7 in the outer
disk (exterior to a few au), where reprocessed Solar ra-
diation dominates disk heating (Chiang & Youdin 2010).
However, higher values of up to 0.7 have been inferred
from observations (Andrews & Williams 2007).

Rather than adopting theoretical estimates of Tmid and
g, we use data on solar nebula H2O, CO and N2 snow-
line locations to set their values. The water snowline
has been localized to ∼ 2 au, though the location likely
evolved with time as Jupiter was forming (Min et al.

Jupiter’s formation location

3

2011). The CO and N2 snowlines are more uncertain.
Based on comet compositions the CO snowline was likely
located in the comet forming zone, since comets present
a large diversity of CO abundances (Mumma & Charnley
2011). This ﬁts with recent estimates of the CO snow-
line in the TW Hya disk (Zhang et al. 2017). Appreciable
amounts of N2 in comets are rare (Cochran et al. 2000;
Cochran 2002; Rubin et al. 2015), though a N2/CO ratio
of 0.15 was recently reported in one comet (Cochran &
McKay 2018), and the majority of comets therefore likely
formed interior to the N2 snowline, placing the N2 snow-
line in the outer range of the proposed comet-forming
region of 5 and 35 au (Mumma & Charnley 2011). Fi-
nally, Pluto appears to be rich in N2, which would be
consistent with formation exterior to the N2 snowline,
though other explanations have been given as well (Stern
et al. 2018). Pluto likely formed at 20–30 au (Kenyon &
Bromley 2012), and we therefore tune our disk model
temperature proﬁle such that the N2 snowline is at 20–
30 au.

Using standard values for H2O, CO and N2 sublima-
tion energies of 5800, 1180, and 1051 K, respectively,
where the latter two values assume CO and N2 subli-
mation from a water-rich ice, we obtain a reasonable ﬁt
to the above snowline constraints when Tmid,2au = 140 K
and q = 0.65. The resulting temperature proﬁle is shown
in the top panel of Fig 1, and the snowline locations of
H2O, CO and N2 are plotted in the panels below. We
note, however, that a warmer or more shallow tempera-
ture proﬁle would have been inferred if pebble drift was
included in the model, since pebble drift move snowlines
inward compared to the static case (e.g. Piso et al. 2015).
The presented temperature proﬁle should therefore be
viewed as a convenient tool to estimate gas and solid
abundances across the solar nebula rather than a an ac-
curate model of the solar nebula thermal structure.

2.2. Molecular Abundances and Snowline Locations
The gas and solid-state distributions of elements in a
disk is primarily set by the condensation lines of major
element carriers, e.g. silicate grains, H2O CO and CO2
for oxygen. In this paper we consider only the elements
that have been quantiﬁed in Jupiter’s atmosphere, i.e.
O, C, N, P, S, Xe, Kr and Ar. The carriers of several
of these are unfortunately poorly constrained and the
estimates in Table 1 should be treated as provisional.
Our general strategy is to use data from the interstellar
medium (ISM), which provides abundance baselines for
he young solar nebula, and augment with solar system
data as available.

In the dense ISM, oxygen is mainly carried by sili-
cate grains, H2O, CO and CO2, with similar amounts
of O in the ﬁrst three carriers, while CO2 is present at
a ∼ 25% level compared to water (Whittet 2010; ¨Oberg
et al. 2011a; Boogert et al. 2015). In comets, H2O ap-
pears more abundant than silicate, while CO2 is ∼20%
compared to water and CO abundances vary (Mumma
& Charnley 2011). We adopt a mixed scheme with equal
abundances of O in H2O and silicate grains, and CO
and CO2 abundances that are 50% and 25% compared
to H2O respectively, and set the absolute abundances so
that they add up to Solar (Asplund et al. 2009).

Based on the oxygen budget above, 50% of the car-

bon is in CO and CO2. We split the remaining carbon
into one part volatile organics, using ethane as a model
system, and three parts carbon grains and refractory or-
ganics. For nitrogen, ISM data shows that ∼10% of ni-
trogen is in NH3, while solar system, ISM and protoplan-
etary disk data alike indicate that most of the remaining
(∼90%) nitrogen is in N2 (Pontoppidan & Blevins 2014;
¨Oberg et al. 2011a), and we use these estimates. Both
S and P are heavily depleted in the ISM, indicative of
refractory carriers. Finally the noble gases are assumed
to be present in atomic form. All abundances are listed
in Table 1.

We assume silicate grains, carbon grains and refractory
organics, S and P, which are all present in the solid state
at all relevant radii. The abundances of all other species
are modeled to solely depend on the changing balance
between sublimation and condensation as a function of
radius. Condensation rates are described by:

Rcond,i = ngrni,gasviσgr,

(5)

where ngr is the grain number density, ni,gas the number
density of species i in the gas-phase, vi the collisional
velocity of grains and species i which is assumed to the
be the thermal velocity of i, and σgr is the collisional
cross section which is the cross section of the grain. It
is useful to rewrite this equation in terms of abundances
x with respect to the main constituent of the solar neb-
ula, hydrogen nuclei, in which case the equation instead
becomes:

Rcond,i = xgrxi,gasn2

Hviσgr.

(6)

Sublimation is described in detail by e.g. Fraser et al.
(2001) and Bisschop et al. (2006). In summary, for low
surface coverages where all surface molecules are avail-
able for sublimation, sublimation is calculated from:

Rsubl,i = xi,grainnH × νiExp(Esubl,i/T ),

(7)

where xi,grain is the abundance of i frozen out on grains,
νi is the attempt frequency, Esubl,i is the sublimation
barrier in units of Kelvin, and T is the grain tempera-
ture which is assumed to be perfectly coupled to the gas
temperature in the dense disk midplane. Sublimation
energies and attempt frequencies for all species are listed
in Table 1. For higher surface coverages, where only the
top layer of the ice can sublime, the sublimation rate is
instead:

Rsubl,i = xgrainnH10154σgrain × νiExp(Esubl,i/T ). (8)

We assume that there is a steady state between sub-
limation and condensation at each radius, and that the
total abundance xi = xi,gas + xi,gr is constant. We then
use the adopted disk temperature and midplane hydro-
gen density proﬁle to calculate the gas and grain abun-
dance of each species as a function of solar nebula radius.
The results of these calculation are shown in Fig. 1. Note
that the CO snowline is at ∼20 Au, and the N2 snowline
at ∼26 au in agreement with the above snowline location
constraints from solar system composition data. The Ar
snowline at ∼40 au is the most distant one in our model;
under nebular conditions and using the binding to water
ice reported by Smith et al. (2016), Ar only freezes out
<21 K. More recent, unpublished data suggests a slightly
higher Ar condensation temperature of ∼25 K (Schnei-
derman, private communication), which would move the
Ar snowline close to the N2 snowline. We use the pub-
lished value in this study, but note that the existing Ar
sublimation data may place Jupiter’s inception 10 au fur-
ther out than is actually required.

We can use the snowline calculations above to calcu-
late the relative abundances of O, C, N, P, S, Ar, Kr
and Xe in solids, and hence the achievable enrichment
patterns for a planet forming at diﬀerent radii. Figure 2
shows the O, C and N solid abundances with respect to
S, normalized to Solar abundances. Sulfur is a reason-
able reference element since it is a solid at all relevant
radii. At 5 au, the solid-state O/S, C/S and N/S ra-
tios are 0.76, 0.41, and 0.10 respectively. This entails
that an atmosphere enriched with solids at this radii, i.e.
the current location of Jupiter, will not obtain a close
to uniform enrichment pattern unless entrapment of N2
and noble gases is extremely eﬃcient. O/S, C/S and N/S
solid-state ratios approach Solar as the distance from the
Sun increases, and become Solar beyond the N2 snowline
at 26 au. Beyond 40 au, even Ar freezes out resulting in
icy solids with Solar composition except for in in H, He
and Ne.

3.2. Fiducial Model for Jupiter’s Formation
Considering 1) that solids are only expected to have
Solar composition in O, C, N, S, P and noble gases in
the outer solar nebula, and 2) that Jupiter appears uni-
formly enriched in these same elements, it follows that
Jupiter likely formed with substantial amounts of outer
Nebula solids. To account for this, our ﬁducial model
assumes that Jupiter’s core formed beyond 45 au, and
thus contains a large reservoir of heavy elements at Solar
ratios. Based on e.g. Bitsch et al. (2015), we further
assume that the newly formed core migrated inwards to-
ward its current location, while it accreted most of its
envelope – the estimated formation+migration timescale
from 45 au is ∼2.5 Myrs (Bitsch et al. 2015). For simplic-
ity we assume that the majority of the envelope was ac-
creted close to 5 au and thus has a 5 au gas composition.
Over time this envelope became enriched by dissolution
and outward mixing of the core (dredging) (Stevenson
1982; Wahl et al. 2017), and by local (5 au) accretion of
solids which dissolved in the gaseous envelope.

The model hinges on the possibility of dissolution of
both the core and later accreted solids. Models of im-
pacts of ice-rich planetesimals with radii of 30 m to 1
km show complete ablation in the outer envelope for a
wide range of parameters Pollack et al. (1996); Iaroslavitz
& Podolak (2007). More refractory planetesimals and
larger objects show more mixed behavior (Pinhas et al.
2016; Liu et al. 2019). To our knowledge there is no

Galileo (O, C, S, Ar, Kr and Xe (Mahaﬀy et al. 2000; Wong et al.

et al. 2017)).

somewhat arbitrary and simply encodes a scenario where
there is substantial contributions from both reservoirs (in
the next section we explore scenarios where one or the
other dominates). We scale the total core and local en-
richment such that the sulfur enrichment in Jupiter’s en-
velope agrees with observations. The resulting elemental
composition in Jupiter’s atmosphere can then be traced
back to three diﬀerent sources: mixing of the core, which
results in a constant enhancement of all species, accre-
tion of gas at 5 au, which is sub-solar in O, S and P, and
almost solar in all other elements, and accretion of solids
at 5 au, which are rich in O, S and P, contain some C,
little N, and no noble gases.

Figure 3 shows the resulting enrichment pattern. The
model agrees with all measured abundances, except for
oxygen, but the Galileo measurement of oxygen is gen-
erally assumed to not be representative of Jupiter’s true
composition. For all elements, core mixing provides at
least 50% of the measured envelope abundances given
our model assumptions, while local solid and gas accre-
tion provides the remainder; gas accretion is more impor-
tant for C, N and noble gases, while local solid accretion
accounts for the remainder of O, S and P.

3.3. Model grid results
To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the forma-
tion and migration history of Jupiter, Figure 4 explores
the outcomes of diﬀerent combinations of core formation
locations, gas envelope accretion locations, and relative
contributions from core mixing and planetesimal dissolu-
tion on the predicted element enhancements in Jupiter’s
envelope. Similarly to the ﬁducial model, we ﬁx the to-
tal amount of solid dissolution such that the sulphur en-
hancement matches the observed one.

In the ﬁrst set of models (left column), the core and gas
are accreted at the same location between 45 and 5 au,
and all enhancements can be traced back to the solid
and gas compositions at the initial formation location.
This is a toy version of a scenario where initial migration
is slow.
In this scenario, formation at 45 au is consis-
tent with data because all elements in question are at
equal abundances exterior to the Ar snowline. Complete

and thick lines for ices and refractory grain material. The trans-
parent light orange band marks the current location of Jupiter at
5 au, and the transparent dark orange band the location of its core
formation at 45 au in our ﬁducial model, though core formation
at 30 au would be suﬃcient to account to Jupiter’s N enrichment.
Note that without substantial entrapment in water ice the C/S and
N/S ratios in solids are low around Jupiter’s current location.

similar calculation for pebbles, but it is commonly as-
sumed that icy pebbles completely dissolve, while refrac-
tory pebbles may or may not reach the core (Venturini
et al. 2016). For simplicity, we assume complete dis-
solution of impacting pebbles and planetesimals in the
gaseous envelope, but this may require an update as more
calculations become available. The main eﬀect on our
model if refractory material does not dissolve would be
to lower the P and S enhancements originating from im-
pacting pebbles and planetesimals. The eﬃciency of core
mixing is even more uncertain and we discuss it further
in §4.

The relative contributions of core mixing and disso-
lution of locally accreted solids to Jupiter’s atmosphere
are unknown. In our ﬁducial model we scale their relative
contributions, such that half of the sulfur in Jupiter’s en-
velope, our reference species, originates from core mixing,
and half from solid accretion at 5 au. This 50-50 divide is

30 au is suﬃcient to explain observations.

formation at 30 au also provides a good ﬁt to the data
with the exception of Ar, which as mentioned above may
in reality condense further in than this model suggests.
Formation at smaller radii provides a poor ﬁt, because of
the low solid abundance of N, Ar and Kr at 15 au, and of
N, C, Ar, Kr and Xe at 5 au, which entails that they are
predicted to be present in Jupiter’s atmosphere at Solar
levels, rather than the ∼2 times higher levels observed.
While complete planet formation beyond 30 au is consis-
tent with Jupiter’s abundance pattern, we note that it is

not supported by either theory (e.g. Bitsch et al. 2015)
or by observations (e.g. Kruijer et al. 2017) and are only
presented here as model end members.

In the second column of Fig. 4 we consider models
where the solids originate in the outer solar system, while
the gas envelope is accreted at 15 or 5 au. This mimics
scenarios where the core forms early at 15-45 au, and the
envelope is accreted during inward migration closer to
Jupiter’s present-day location, and later planetesimal ac-
cretion and dissolution is ineﬃcient. None of the models

result in perfect ﬁts to observations. The models where
the core forms at 30-45 au provide good ﬁts to C, N, S
and P, but not to the noble gases, which are either under-
or overpredicted, while core formation at 15 au also fails
to reproduce N.

The third and last column of Fig. 4 explores elemen-
tal enhancements in Jupiter’s envelope when a fraction
of the dissolved solids polluting the envelope originates
from a core formed at 45 au, and the remainder from
solid accretion at 5 au. This assumes the same scenario
as in the ﬁducial model and simply varies the relative
contributions from the core and later accreted pebbles,
boulders and planetesimals. We consider scenarios where
core mixing contributes 90, 70, 50 and 30% of the total
solids dissolved in Jupiter’s envelope, and as Fig. 4, the
two intermediate cases provide good ﬁts to observations,
while the two extremes deviate from observations.

In summary, Jupiter’s composition is only well repro-
duced if it obtained a large amount of solids from the
outer solar system through core formation exterior to the
N2 and Ar snowlines, which in our disk model are placed
at ∼26 and 40 au, respectively. Though note that the lat-
ter may becme revised inwards with new laboratory data
made available (Schneiderman private comm.). Once the
core is formed, it is possible to reproduce all observed
abundances if Jupiter either accreted its gaseous enve-
lope in the outer solar system, or if it accreted its enve-
lope at smaller radii together with a substantial amount
of dissolvable solids in the form of pebbles and planetes-
imals.

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Core formation and mixing
We have showed that formation of Jupiter’s core exte-
rior to the N2 and Ar snowlines, followed by core mixing
into the gaseous envelope, provides a good ﬁt to Jupiter
volatile abundances when combined with inward migra-
tion, and with gas and further pebble and planetesimal
accretion in the inner solar nebula. This model hinges on
several assumptions, 1) that it is possible to form a large,
∼20 Earth mass planetary core in the outer solar nebula,
2) that it can migrate to Jupiter’s current location be-
fore the nebular gas dissipates, and 3) that a substantial
portion of that core, >50% could become dissolved in
Jupiter’s envelope. The plausibilities of these processes
are is the subjects of this sub-section.

As introduced in §1, pebble accretion models that in-
clude a full dynamical treatment of the disk and nascent
planets predict that Jupiter’s core formed substantially
further out in the solar system compared to Jupiter’s
present location (Bitsch et al. 2015; Ali-Dib 2017; Bitsch
et al. 2019). How far out in the disk depends on when
the core formed and on the disk mass and metallicity.
The latter two are poorly constrained from solar sys-
tem data and protoplanetary disk studies alike. Obser-
vations of protoplanetary disks may provide some infor-
mation about when planet formation typically begins,
however, assuming that observed sub-structures are as-
sociated with planet formation. The youngest disks that
show substantial gaps are <1 Myrs old, including the
iconic HL Tau disk (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015).
This suggests that the onset plane core formation is
(Bitsch et al. 2015) showed that the
<1 Myr as well.

earlier Jupiter’s core formed the further out in the disk
it must have originated – if it formed within a 1 Myr of
the inception of the solar nebula and the nebula lasted
for 3 Myrs, Jupiter’s core likely formed beyond 30 au, in
agreement with our model requirements.

If Jupiter’s core formed in the outer solar system, could
it also have accreted its envelope at >30 au? Recent anal-
yses of asteroid population data suggests that Jupiter’s
core was in place early in the history of the solar system
(Kruijer et al. 2017). This favors a scenario where the
core alone formed at large distances and then migrated
inwards. Recent work by Pirani et al. (2019) also places
Jupiter’s core formation in the outer solar system, based
on Trojan data, while most of the gas envelope is accreted
closer to 5 au, consistent with our ﬁducial model.

The next issue is whether nitrogen and other ele-
ments accumulated during core formation would remain
trapped in the core, or become well-mixed throughout
Jupiter’s interior after the planet’s gas envelope was cap-
tured. Previous ab-initio calculations have shown that
elements as heavy as Fe and Mg should be soluble in
hydrogen at the pressures and temperatures expected in
Jupiter’s interior (Wilson & Militzer 2012b; Wahl et al.
2013; Gonz´alez-Cataldo et al. 2014). Water ice is solu-
ble at temperatures of around 3000 K at Jovian interior
pressures (Wilson & Militzer 2012a), which is much lower
than the temperatures expected in the region of Jupiter’s
core. An initially icy core accreted in the outer solar sys-
tem should therefore dissolve into the nearby hydrogen
envelope.

Although dissolution of heavy species from a core into a
pure hydrogen envelope is expected, subsequent mixing
into the gas envelope depends on convective processes
that are still poorly understood under Jovian condi-
tions (Leconte & Chabrier 2013; Nettelmann et al. 2015;
Moll et al. 2017). Double-diﬀusive layered convection, if
present, could reduce mixing eﬃciency, although its im-
portance throughout Jupiter’s evolutionary history is de-
bated (Leconte & Chabrier 2013; Moll et al. 2017; Vazan
et al. 2018). While the theory remains to be worked out
there is recent empirical support for a core dissolution
and dredging scenario: inter-comparison of interior mod-
els with Jupiter’s low order gravitational moments J2-J8
measured by JUNO suggests a large, dilute core, which
is consistent with a signiﬁcant amount of core dredg-
ing having occurred (Wahl et al. 2017). To account for
this Liu et al. (2019) proposed that the young Jupiter
collided head on with a large planet embryo, which shat-
tered Jupiter’s primordial core, and distributed its heavy
elements into the inner envelope.

4.2. The role of volatile entrapment
So far all our models have assumed that volatile en-
trapment was unimportant in setting the bulk elemental
abundances in the solar system. This is opposite to most
previous explanations of Jupiter’s enrichment pattern.
We therefore brieﬂy explore the outcome of our model
when incorporating maximum entrapment assuming that
∼5 H2O molecules are required for each entrapped hy-
per volatile, a 100% entrapment eﬃciency, and that the
hypervolatiles under consideration, CO, N2 and noble
gases, are all entrapped equally well. In other words we
assume that an equal proportion of each hypervolatile is
entrapped such that their sum does not exceed 20% of

8

ilar to that of C and N, i.e. that it is not substantially
more enhanced. This is distinct from models that require
entrapment of C and N carriers in H2O ice, where oxygen
will be enhanced by a substantially higher factor.

A second set of predictions concerns Saturn. If Saturn
and Jupiter formed at the same time, Saturn’s inception
was likely ∼3 au exterior to Jupiter’s (Pirani et al. 2019).
In our model that places Saturn’s formation well outside
of the N2 and Ar snowlines, and we should expect a sim-
ilar enrichment pattern as in Saturn as in Jupiter, i.e. a
near constant enrichment of O, C, N, S, P, Xe, Kr and Ar
in Saturn’s envelope. The formation timescale for both
Saturn and Jupiter would be 2-3 Myrs and they would
therefore have to start forming when the solar nebula
was <1 Myr old (Bitsch et al. 2015). Another possible
scenario is that Saturn formed after Jupiter had already
fully assembled and migrated to its ﬁnal position. In this
scenario Saturn’s core would begin to form when the so-
lar nebula was already older than 2 Myrs, since it takes
∼2 Myrs for Jupiter-sized planet to form and migrate
into place if its inception is beyond 30 au. Adopting
a disk lifetime of 3 Myrs, Saturn would then need to
form in <1 Myr, which limits its formation location to
15-20 au according to the model grid presented in Bitsch
et al. (2015). In this scenario, P, O, C, Xe, and Kr should
all be similarly enhanced in Saturn’s envelope, while N
and Ar should be underabundant. Better constraints on
Saturn’s elemental composition is thus key to constrain
when and how the outer Solar System assembled.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Jupiter’s near-uniform enhancements in C, N, S, P, Ar,
Kr and Xe are diﬃcult to explain if Jupiter formed close
to its current location at 5 au from the Sun. At these
radii solids are expected to be depleted in nitrogen, car-
bon, and noble gases compared to oxygen, sulphur and
phosphorous, and Jupiter’s composition cannot then be
explained by accretion of locally assembled solids. Trans-
port of solids from the outer solar system might provide
a partial answer, but to ﬁt observations N2 entrapment
in water ice would have to be near-complete in the outer
solar nebula, and locally assembled pebbles and planetes-
imals must have been prevented from polluting Jupiter’s
envelope with O-rich solids. Both seem unlikely, but a
ﬁnal test will come with Juno’s measurement of oxygen
in Jupiter’s envelope. If the observed nitrogen enhance-
ment is due to N2 entrapment in water, the oxygen en-
richment in Jupiter should be high, since at least ﬁve and
more likely ten water molecules are required for each en-
trapped N2 molecule.

We propose that Jupiter’s abundances are instead due
to that Jupiter’s core formed in the cold (<25 K), outer
solar nebula, beyond the N2 and Ar snowlines. At these
radii (>30 au) solids contained Solar ratios between O, C,
N, S, P and noble gases. During envelope accretion and
later planetesimal bombardment a substantial fraction
of the primordial core was dissolved into Jupiter’s en-
velope, producing the characteristic abundance pattern.
Based on a small set of toy models, this scenario is robust
to later solid accretion close to Jupiter’s current feeding
zone during e.g. the clean-up phase of planet formation,
as long as a majority of solids dissolved in Jupiter’s en-
velope originated beyond the N2 and Ar snowlines. A
key prediction of this model is that oxygen should be

noble gases in water ice.
the total number of water molecules. This likely over-
predicts the amount of possible N2 entrapment, since ex-
periments show that N2 is less eﬃciently trapped than
CO (e.g. Bar-Nun et al. 1985, 2007; Yokochi et al. 2012),
and thus provides a limiting case for testing our con-
clusions. The assumption of that at least ﬁve water
molecules are need for each entrapped hypervolatile is
based on both clathration (Lunine & Stevenson 1985)
and amorphous ice entrapment studies (Notesco et al.
2003; Fayolle et al. 2011; Simon et al. 2019).

Based on the adopted water and hypervolatile abun-
dances, a maximum of 28% of the nebular hypervolatiles
can become trapped. Figure 5 shows the results when
incorporating this maximum level of entrapment for the
ﬁducial model, and for a model where Jupiter completely
forms at 5 au. The ﬁducial model results are basically
unchanged by including entrapment. By contrast, in the
model where Jupiter forms in situ, including entrapment
does enhance N, C and noble gas abundances, but even
our very optimistic, maximum entrapment assumption
does not result in suﬃcient CO, N2 or noble gases to
explain observations. It is important to note that it is
quite diﬃcult to conceive of a scenario where maximum
entrapment would occur, since N2 is likely to freeze out
on top of the H2O ice matrix in the cooling Nebula rather
than becoming perfectly mixed in with it, and should be
trapped with a lower eﬃciency than the more abundant
CO.

4.3. Predictions for Outer solar system missions
The strongest prediction emerging from our model is
that the oxygen enhancement in Jupiter should be sim-

enhanced at a similar level to carbon and nitrogen in
Jupiter’s envelope.

We note that our proposed formation location for
Jupiter’s core is consistent with recent pebble accretion
models, which also place Jupiter’s inception in the outer
solar nebula, and with observations of an extended core
in Jupiter. It also ﬁts with increasing evidence of planet-
induced sub-structure at 10s of au in many protoplan-

etary disks, suggesting that gas giants may commonly
begin their existence at 10s of au, followed by inward
migration during their early stages of formation.
