On the heat capacity of liquids at high temperatures

Making use of a simple approximation for the evolution of the radial distribution function, we
calculate the temperature dependence of the heat capacity Cv of Ar at constant density. Cv de-
creases with temperature roughly according to the law ∼ T −1/4, slowly approaching the hard sphere
asymptotic value Cv = 3
2 R. However, the asymptotic value of Cv is not reachable at reasonable
temperatures , but stays close to 1.7–1.8 R over a wide range of temperatures after passing a ” magic
” 2R value at about 2000 K. Nevertheless these values has nothing to do with loss of vibrational
degrees of freedom, but arises as a result of a temperature variation of the collision diameter σ.

It has been known for a long time that Cv of many
liquids almost equals that of solids at the melting point,
decreases with temperature, and reaches a value of ∼ 2R
(R-gas constant) [1–6]. A similar trend was observed in
model systems of particles interacting with an inverse
power potential [7]. With time, a general belief was
formed that Cv varies from ∼ 3R to ∼ 2R with tem-
perature from the melting to the critical temperature.
Ref. [8] provides an attractive, though probably wrong,
explanation of this behaviour of Cv. It assumes that, in
liquids at high temperatures, the transverse vibrational
modes cease to exist, whereas the longitudinal mode still
remains, resulting in Cv = 1R + 1/2R + 1/2R = 2R.
Recently, it has been proposed that decreasing the heat
capacity beyond the 2R value implies a transition to a
truly gaseous state without any vibrational degrees of
freedom. A corresponding line in the P -T space border-
ing a region with Cv ≥ 2R was named a Frenkel line in
honor of the Russian theoretician Yaakov Frenkel [9–11].
However, the interpretation of the 2R value of a heat
capacity as a result of loss of the transverse elastic re-
sponse is not proved in either case. So it is appropriate
to carry out an analysis of the situation based on a tra-
ditional approach to the thermodynamics of liquids and
gases.

Lets write the energy of a classical system of particles

where Φ(r) pair interaction potential, g(r) - radial distri-

We approximate the radial distribution function g(r)

at moderate density by the step function,

g(r) = 0, at r < σ
g(r) = 1, at r > σ

This approximation should work well enough at high

As is seen from eq. 7, the heat capacity Cv at con-
stant density of a system of particles interacting with
the Lennard-Jones potential decreases at high tempera-
tures roughly according to the law ∼ T −1/4, slowly ap-
proaching the hard sphere asymptotic value of Cv = 3
2 R.
Using the potential parameters known for Ar and the mo-
lar volume value of Ar at the triple point (ε/k = 119.3,
r0(A) = 3.405, VT.P. = 28.33) [12] and eq. 7 we made the
corresponding calculations, shown in Fig. 1. As we ex-
pected our approach does not work properly with the full
potential 4 at low temperatures, whereas using only the
repulsive part of the potential 4 gives better results. The

 
 
 
 
 
 
latter is not surprising because a system of soft spheres
on a homogeneous attractive background works satisfac-
tory for noble gases. Note that the homogeneous attrac-
tive background does not contribute to the heat capacity.
Remarkably, the reference data for Cv in the triple point
(see Ref. [13]) lies almost exactly on the calculated curve
2 (Fig. 1). As is seen in Fig. 1 the asymptotic value of

heat capacity curves are situated close to the value of
1.8R, passing a ”magic” value of 2R at about 2000 K.
Even at 105 K (compared to the temperature of the Ar
critical point 150 K) the heat capacity is still very close
to 1.7R. However, this value is not a result of loss of the
vibrational modes, but it occurs in our model owing to
the temperature variation of the collision diameter σ.

In conclusion, making use a simple approximation for
an evolution of the radial distribution function, we calcu-
late the temperature dependence of heat capacity Cv of
Ar at constant density. The result shows that Cv of Ar
decreases with temperature according to the law ∼ T −1/4
and tends to the hard sphere asymptotic value Cv = 3
2 R.
However, as is seen in Fig. 1, the asymptotic value of
Cv is not reachable at reasonable temperatures, and Cv
stays close to 1.7–1.8 R over a wide range of tempera-
tures. Nevertheless these values as well as the ” magic ”
value of 2R have nothing to do with loss of the vibrational
degrees of freedom, but arise as a collision eﬀect.
