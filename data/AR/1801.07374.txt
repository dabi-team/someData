A STATISTICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN PHOTOSPHERIC VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS
OBTAINED BY SDO/HMI AND HINODE/SP

ABSTRACT
Since May 1, 2010, we have been able to study (almost) continuously the vector magnetic ﬁeld in the
Sun, thanks to two space-based observatories: the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Hinode. Both are
equipped with instruments able to measure the Stokes parameters of Zeeman-induced polarization of photo-
spheric line radiation. But the observation modes, the spectral lines, the spatial, spectral and temporal sampling,
and even the inversion codes used to recover magnetic and thermodynamic information from the Stokes pro-
ﬁles are diﬀerent. We compare the vector magnetic ﬁelds derived from observations with the HMI instrument
on board SDO, with those observed by the SP instrument on Hinode. We have obtained relationships between
components of magnetic vectors in the umbra, penumbra and plage observed in 14 maps of NOAA AR 11084.
Importantly, we have transformed SP data into observables comparable to those of HMI, to explore possible
inﬂuences of the diﬀerent modes of operation of the two instruments, and the inversion schemes used to infer
the magnetic ﬁelds. The assumed ﬁlling factor (fraction of each pixel containing a Zeeman signature) produces
the most signiﬁcant diﬀerences in derived magnetic properties, especially in the plage. The spectral and angu-
lar samplings have the next largest eﬀects. We suggest to treat the disambiguation in the same way in the data
provided by HMI and SP. That would make the relationship between the vector magnetic ﬁeld recovered from
these data stronger, what would favor the simultaneous or complementary use of both instruments.

1. INTRODUCTION
The goal of this paper is to compare statistically the vec-
tor magnetic ﬁelds retrieved from SDO/HMI (Scherrer et al.
2012; Schou et al. 2012) with those from Hinode-SOT/SP
(Tsuneta et al. 2008; Lites et al. 2013). We are not interested
in the absolute calibration of the magnetograms, but in the
comparison between them. We shall provide a way, based on
a statistical analysis, to go from the magnetic ﬁeld measured
by one instrument to the other in a similar way as Berger &
Lites (2003) did for the imaging polarimeter on SoHO (MDI,
Scherrer et al. 1995) and the slit ground-based Advanced
Spectro Polarimeter (Elmore et al. 1992). The present com-
parison is motivated by and follows a similar methodology of
Berger & Lites (2003). We also analyze the inﬂuence of the
various observing conﬁgurations and inversion codes (ICs),
henceforth called actors, in the derivation of vector magnetic
ﬁelds.

In addition to the original data provided by HMI and SP3,
we have created pseudo-SP (SP data spectrally sampled as
HMI does) maps to simulate the actors present in HMI. Our
rationale is that SP is an instrument with detailed spectral data
and a higher angular resolution, which, being optically stable
over the period of an observing run, and being free of signiﬁ-
cant seeing-induced crosstalk, should yield magnetic ﬁelds of
a higher quality, serving as a kind of “ground truth” measure-
ment for HMI. In Section 2 we describe the instruments and
data we are comparing, how we create the pseudo-SP maps,
the methodology used to prepare and compare the data, and
the comparisons we have carried on. We also remind the
reader of the meaning of the statistical parameters used to sup-
port our conclusions.

3 For the sake of clarity, we will refer to SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP

instruments just as HMI and SP respectively.

In Section 3, we discuss the vector magnetic ﬁeld compar-
isons. We also explore how that comparison might be aﬀected
when the spectral sampling, the spatial sampling, the spectral
line, the inversion code and the disambiguation code are dif-
ferent. All our results are based on an statistical analysis made
over 14 maps of an active region observed simultaneously by
HMI and SP. Finally, in Section 4, we summarize our ﬁnd-
ings and suggest several improvements that might beneﬁt the
simultaneous or complementary use of HMI and SP data. In
the Appendix, the interested reader may ﬁnd detailed statisti-
cal tables. Although those tables make the length of this paper
longer than expected, we believe they are necessary to support
our results.

The main goal of this paper is to encourage the solar com-
munity to use HMI and SP data either simultaneously or al-
ternatively if one data set is available in one instrument but
not in the other. Nowadays, the synergy between the numer-
ical experiments –including simulations and extrapolations–
and the observational data is critical for the advance of our
knowledge of the Sun. In that sense, to speak the same lan-
guage makes the communication between those data prod-
ucts easier. Apparently, the majority of the solar commu-
nity uses the Cartesian system instead of the Spherical co-
ordinate to express the vector magnetic ﬁeld, and for that rea-
son we decided to oﬀer our results primarily in the Cartesian
coordinates system. Therefore, we have conducted our in-
vestigation in the Cartesian on-CCD coordinates system, i.e.
B = {Bx, By, Bz}, although the most important comparisons
have been also made for the spherical on-CCD coordinates
system, i.e. B = {|B|, θB, φB}4. As we will see, using the spher-
ical on-CCD coordinates system has a great advantage to de-
couple the eﬀect of the ﬁeld strength and the disambiguation
in the computation of the horizontal components of the vector

4 The spherical components of a vector A are usually denoted as {Ar, Aθ,
Aφ}. In this paper, we follow the notation widely used in the solar community
for the vector magnetic ﬁeld B.

magnetic ﬁeld.

2. DATA ANALYSIS
HMI and SP instruments make full-polarimetric observa-
tions (i.e., the four Stokes parameters I, Q, U and V) of the
solar disk and selected areas in the Sun respectively. Both in-
struments observe spectral lines formed in the photosphere.
The polarization induced by the Zeeman eﬀect (e.g., Jeﬀeries,
Lites & Skumanich 1989) allows us to infer the photospheric
vector magnetic ﬁeld, given a suitable model for the radiating
layers. These models work with the data in what is collec-
tively called an inversion scheme, or simply an “inversion”.

2.1. Data Selection
HMI provides full polarimetric ﬁltergrams of the full so-
lar disk taken in just six carefully selected spectral positions
around the Fe I 6173 Å line. Every ≈ 69mÅ, the line is
sampled with spectral ﬁltergram with a bandpass of roughly
70mÅ (spectral bandpass tunable over 680mÅ), and the spa-
tial sampling is 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) × 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48). The ﬁeld of view is the whole
Sun. While the total polarimetric cycle takes 135 s5, the vec-
tor magnetograms provided by the oﬃcial web page6 have a
cadence of 12 minutes, as many images are needed to build
up an average to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

The SP data are full slit spectro-polarimetric data in the Fe I
6301 & 6302 Å lines. The data used here have a spatial sam-
pling of 0.30(cid:48)(cid:48) ×0.32(cid:48)(cid:48), and the spectral sampling is 21mÅ/px.
There are several data products available for both instru-
ments. In this investigation, the main comparison is between
the vector magnetic ﬁeld recorded in the HMI hmi.B 720s
data and the one saved in the SP Level2 data. Albeit, the main
goal of this investigation is to provided to the solar commu-
nity a comparison between these easy-access data as they are.
The hmi.B 720s data are full-disk Milne-Eddigton inver-
sion results with the magnetic ﬁeld azimuthal ambiguity reso-
lution applied (Hoeksema et al. 2014). The 720s in the name
of the data product refers to the post-observation integration
in time of the data to improve the S/N ratio, as we mentioned
above7.

The Level2 data are selected-area Milne-Eddigton inversion
results with the magnetic ﬁeld azimuthal ambiguity resolution
not applied8.

In addition to the SP Level2 data, we have also used the
Stokes proﬁles originally observed by SP (Level1). The SP
Level2 data provide maps of physical variables – such as the
ﬁeld strength, the inclination and the azimuth of vector mag-
netic ﬁeld, line-of-sight velocity, and so on– after the inver-
sion of the Stokes proﬁles recorded in the SP Level1 data.

We have inverted the original Stokes proﬁles observed by
SP considering a ﬁlling factor (FF) equal to 1. Since the data
used to obtain the vector magnetic ﬁeld are the original SP
Level1 data, i.e. Fe I 6301 & 6302 Å lines., and we use the
inversion code used for the oﬃcial SP inversions, we refer to
this data as SP data inverted with FF equal to 1, or SPFF1.

We have created a new data set from the original SP Level1
data. We have convolved the Stokes proﬁles observed by SP

dence of 90s. See http://hmi.stanford.edu/hminuggets/?p=1596.

(Level1) corresponding to Fe I 6302Å with the HMI trans-
mission proﬁles calculated for that line. The HMI pipeline
calculates these instrumental proﬁles for any pixel in the so-
lar disk, so it takes into account the Doppler shift due to the
diﬀerential rotation in the solar surface. For each SP map, we
have calculated the instrumental proﬁles for the pixel located
at the center of the FoV, and applied them to all pixels in that
SP map. We refer to the SP data sampled and ﬁltered as HMI
ﬁltergrams are made as S2H (after SP to HMI). The S2H data
have the same spatial sampling as the original SP data. They
are inverted with the same inversion code as HMI, i.e., VFISV
with FF equal to 1. Notice for creating the S2H data we only
use 1 of the 2 lines observed by SP, since we use the same in-
strumental proﬁles used by HMI, which cover a spectral range
equivalent to one spectral line in the SP spectropolarimetric
data. We have chosen the line Fe I 6302 Å because its eﬀec-
tive Land´e factor, ge f f , is the same as the one of the line used
by HMI, being ge f f = 2.5 for these two spectral lines. The
code that calculates the instrumental transmission proﬁles for
any spectral line at a point of the solar disk is the same used in
the HMI pipeline at JSOC. This code was kindly provided in
the IDL version by Dr. S. Couvidat from Stanford University.
The SP slit does not always scan the solar surface with a
constant step in the perpendicular direction to the slit (Cen-
teno et al. 2009).
In some cases, an interpolation may be
necessary to have an equally-spaced scan. However, since
the ultimate goal in this paper is the comparison between SP
maps (and S2H maps) and HMI maps, the interpolation of SP
data to an equally-spaced grid as initial step is unnecessary,
since the interpolation what matters is the one that matches
the SP maps with HMI maps. Therefore, in this paper we have
skipped the interpolation of the SP data to equally-spaced
grid, and we have directly interpolated the SP magnetic ﬁeld
maps to the HMI ones. Same strategy has been applied to
match the S2H maps with HMI maps. More details about the
co-alignment procedure are given in Section 2.2.

Although the databases of HMI and SP oﬀer diﬀerent data
products, we have selected the data detailed above since they
are the ones that are more directly comparable. Recently,
HMI has started to provide similar full-disk vector magnetic
ﬁeld similar to the ones analyzed in this paper, but with a
post-observation integration time of the data of 135 and 90
s. A comparison between these new HMI data products and
SP data would be interesting. That new comparison with the
one presented in this paper would allow us to better under-
stand the role played by the S/N. Doubtless, the inﬂuence of
this factor in the comparison between diﬀerent instruments is
important. Nevertheless, it currently falls out of the scope of
this paper.

The SP scans required approximately 30 minutes for this
medium size sunspot. In that time, any sunspot may have sig-
niﬁcantly evolved if undergoing signiﬁcant activity, e.g., those
hosting ﬂare activity or during the initial (non-stationary)
emergence phase. Therefore we deliberately selected a ma-
ture active region (NOAA AR 11084) with a well-developed
sunspot, which is located in a relatively isolated and quiet re-
gion. For the comparisons, we selected the HMI data prod-
uct which was closest in time to the time when the slit of
SP was in the middle of its raster. Figure 1 shows the lo-
cation of NOAA AR 11084 and Fig. 2 shows the magnetic
ﬁeld strength maps provided by the SP Level 2 data as result-
ing from the Milne-Eddington gRid Linear Inversion Netwrok

(hereafter MERLIN9) IC on the Level 1 data. Except for the
second map in the ﬁrst row, during which the SP slit jumped,
all maps were used. Table 7 in Section 2.1 of the Appendix
shows a list with the observational details of the selected data.
In addition to the diﬀerence between the instruments used
– therefore between the type of data – we have to take into
account diﬀerences between the ICs used to retrieve the phys-
ical information from the data. HMI B 720s series data re-
sult from the systematic inversion of observed Stokes ﬁlter-
grams by the code Very Fast Inversion of Stokes Vector (here-
after VFISV, Borrero & Kobel 2011; Centeno et al. 2014).
SP data were inverted by MERLIN. As mentioned above,
S2H data were inverted using VFISV as well. Both VFISV
and MERLIN are based on the nonlinear least-squares ﬁt-
ting between the synthetic and the observed proﬁles using
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Both ICs calculate the
synthetic Stokes proﬁles after solving the radiative transfer
equation for polarized light under under the Milne-Eddington
approximation. Thus, the source function varies linearly with
the optical depth, while the other physical parameters are con-
stant through the atmosphere (non-dependence with the opti-
cal depth). These codes provide the vector magnetic ﬁeld,
magnetic ﬁlling factor, source function and source function
gradient, Doppler width, Doppler velocity, damping parame-
ter, and line-to-continuum absorption coeﬃcient.

2.2. Data preparation
In this section, we explain the steps we have applied to the
data to make the comparison between them possible. We have
applied a semi-automatic alignment method using the routine
auto align images developed by T. Metcalf, and poly 2d.
Both routines and dependent ones are available in the Solar-
Software package. The ﬁrst step is to identify manually sev-
eral common structures in both maps. We selected 10 of them.
Then, the code matches the maps maximizing the correlation
between them applying automatically corrections in shifts in
vertical and horizontal direction, rotation and expansion or
contraction. We use the output of the ﬁrst routine as input of
poly 2d on the HMI data. All the comparisons between HMI
and SP, and HMI and S2H have been made considering the
corrections provided by this method.

Even when we have done our best in the alignment between
the maps, some misalignment may be present in some cases.
Several reasons may cause this misalignment. The hardest
one to treat is the a non-constant spatial interpolation between
the FoV observed by HMI and SP. That may be produced by
a non-constant spatial sampling in the direction perpendicu-
lar to the slit, i.e. the size step of the raster changed during
the scan, as it has been reported by Centeno et al. (2009). Of
course, other reason is the natural evolution of the solar fea-
tures while the data were taken. As a visual eﬀect, we are
able to align very good one side of the FoV, but not so good
the other side, where a “stretching” eﬀect may be observed.
In the ﬁrst case, a constant spatial interpolation in the SP data
would help to have these data in a more appropriate spatial
grid. However, we will need another interpolation to match
the HMI spatial scale. We have skipped the ﬁrst step, and we
have to interpolate the SP data directly to HMI. For that rea-
son, we selected 10 points homogeneously distributed in the
FoV to warranty the best possible match between the maps.
The best alignment achieved is under pixel sampling, i.e., un-

der HMI spatial scale or ∼ 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5.” During the remapping pro-
cess the data are interpolated using several procedures.

For SP data, the disambiguation of the azimuth was made
using AZAM code. This code was developed by Dr. P. Sea-
graves and Dr. B. Lites, and it is available in the SolarSoft-
ware distribution. For HMI and S2H data we have used the
disambiguation solution map provided with the original HMI
data (Hoeksema et al. 2014). While the main results presented
in this paper are using AZAM, we have done a detailed stud-
ied of the eﬀect introduced by the disambiguation. Thus, we
have used three disambiguation solutions. Two are as a re-
sult of applying AZAM in slightly diﬀerent ways. The third
is AMBIG, an automatic disambiguation code developed by
(Leka et al. 2009a). The core of this code is similar to the one
used by HMI, although the setup parameters are slightly dif-
ferent. All in all, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
three disambiguation results yielded in the comparison HMI
vs SP and the ones obtained in the comparison HMI vs S2H
(see Table 17 and discussion in Section D). However, if we
do not consider those solar features showing opposite sign in
the horizontal components – mainly located in the plage –,
then the correlation between these data is better. A detailed
discussion is presented in section D of the Appendix.

After the co-aligment and the the disambiguation of the az-
imuth, we calculate the three components of the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld in the observer frame, i.e., as it is observed from
the Earth.

In our study, we have selected 4 diﬀerent regions of interest
(RoI): umbra, penumbra, strong plage, and weak plage. The
umbra and penumbra are calculated taking into account pho-
tometric thresholds with respect to the mean value of the con-
tinuum Intensity in the local quiet sun ( ˜Ic,lqs). Thus, the umbra
is deﬁned as the region where the Ic,lqs < ˜Ic,lqs × 0.55, while
the penumbra is where ˜Ic,lqs × 0.55 < Ic,lqs < ˜Ic,lqs × 0.95. For
the plage we have used total polarization slit-reconstructed
map from the SP data. We have considered as plage as those
locations outside of the umbra and penumbra where the to-
tal polarization signal is larger than 0.005. We have split the
plage region into strong plage and weak plage considering
the values of the components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld (in
Cartesian coordinates, see Section 3.1) or the ﬁeld strength (in
spherical coordinates. The contours of the umbra, penumbra
and plage are showed in the central image of ﬁg. 2. Table
1 shows the averaged (in time) values of the minimum, max-
imum and mean of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the RoIs
considered in the comparison between BHMI and BSP in
spherical coordinates.

2.3. Data treatement and Inversions Setup
As well as re-binning and ﬁltering SP data to match those of
HMI, we must perform what we call cross inversions using the
same IC with the diﬀerent kinds of data or diﬀerent IC with
diﬀerent data. Table 2 lists the various combinations we have
examined. In the following description of the comparison we
have made, the expression ‘Original Inverted Data’ refers to
use the original inversion results provided by the HMI and SP
project oﬃcial web pages. We have re-binned and interpo-
lated the ‘Original inverted data’ to make possible the spatial
matching between them. The comparisons made include:

• Case A: Comparison between Original Inverted Data
(HMI vs SP). The straightforward comparison between
HMI ( hmi.B 720s) and SP (Level2) is done from the
data accessible at the corresponding data base. In this

case, we are comparing diﬀerent data inverted with dif-
ferent inversion code in the two diﬀerent spectral ranges
( Fe I 6173 Å for HMI, and Fe I 6301 and 6302 Å for
SP), and with diﬀerent ﬁlling-factor conditions (FF = 1
for HMI, FF variable for SP). This is the comparison of
the data as they are publicly available.

• Case B: Comparison between Original data with dif-
ferent FF (HMI vs SPFF1). In this case, we have mod-
iﬁed MERLIN code to use FF=1 on SP data (SPFF1),
instead of the data publicly oﬀered, which have FF vari-
able (SP). Both inversions are mode on Fe I 6301 and
6302 Å ˙This modiﬁcation of MERLIN was kindly made
by Dr. A. de Wijn in CSAC at HAO.

• Case C: Comparison between data equally sampled
spectrally (HMI vs S2H). We use VFISV code with FF
variable to invert the S2H data. The stray light proﬁle is
calculated using the same methodology used by the SP
data pipeline. Then, it is convolved with the same HMI
instrumental proﬁles we applied to the corresponding
data. From this comparison we infer the inﬂuence of
the diﬀerent spectral sampling between the original SP
and HMI data.

• Case D: Comparison between data equally sampled
with FF ﬁxed to 1 (HMI vs S2HFF1).
In this case,
we use VFISV code with FF=1 to invert the S2H data
(S2HFF1). (By default original HMI data are inverted
with the ﬁxed FF to 1.)

• Case E: Comparison between SP data using diﬀerent
FF ((SPFF1 vs SP).). We use the original SP Stokes
proﬁles data (Level1), and we invert them with MER-
LIN using diﬀerent FF, i.e. either with FF variable (SP)
or with ﬁxed to 1 (SPFF1). Therefore, we see the in-
ﬂuence of the FF during the inversion on the original
SP data. In this comparison, we invert both lines Fe I
6301 Åand 6302 Å, as MERLIN does for the original
SP data.

• Case F: Comparison between S2H data inverted with
FF ﬁxed to 1 and the same data inverted with FF vari-
able (S2HFF1 vs SH2). In this case, we investigate the
eﬀect of diﬀerent FF during the inversion on the S2H
data. The data have the same spatial resolution, the ob-
served line is the same (Fe I 6302Å), and the IC used is
the same (VFISV).

• Case G: Comparison between S2H and SP data using
FF variable (S2H vs SP). In this case, the data have the
same spatial and temporal resolution, and are perfectly
co-aligned. SP observes Fe I 6301 & 6302 Å spectral
lines, while S2H data only considers Fe I 6302 Å. We
use diﬀerent spectral sampling and diﬀerent ICs.

• Case H: Comparison between S2H and SP data using
FF ﬁxed to 1 (SH2FF1 vs SPFF1). Same than case G
but using FF ﬁxed to 1,

We have intentionally left the impact introduced by the
disambiguation solution as the last step of our comparisons.
While all the others actors play a signiﬁcant role in the process
of calculation of the ﬁeld strength, inclination and azimuth
of the vector magnetic ﬁeld, the disambiguation solution will
play a diﬀerent role in the composition of that vector. This
is the only case where the information is not contained in the
data themselves, we must add information to obtain an “opti-
mal” disambiguated solution (Hoeksema et al. 2014). As we
shall show, the chosen solution to the disambiguation prob-
lem may have a relevant impact in the correlation between the
magnetic ﬁeld observed by the two instruments. That rela-
tionship might be easily improved if both data set solved the
disambiguation problem with the same code. A detailed dis-
cussion on this topic is given in Section D of the Appendix.

2.4. Comparison of the Data: Statistical Analysis
Figure 3 shows the scatter plots for the components of the
vector magnetic ﬁeld BHMI versus BSP at the RoIs, i.e. the
comparison between the HMI and SP data as they are pro-
vided by the respective oﬃcial data centers (case A). They
show a linear dependency. Hence, we have evaluated a linear
regression ﬁt between the components of the vectors BHMI
and BSP for the RoIs at each of the 14 selected maps. Tables
8 and 9 in Section B of the Appendix list all the parameters
calculated for the comparison between BHMI and BSP . For
these linear regression ﬁts we obtain the following parame-
ters: intercept a, slope b, (estimated) standard deviation of the
residuals se, correlation coeﬃcient r, and coeﬃcient of deter-
mination r2. The interpretation of these parameters in this pa-
per is strictly referred to a simple linear regression calculated
using the least squares method10. Finally, we have calculated
averages of intercepts and slopes, averages of the estimated
standard deviation <se> , correlation coeﬃcients <r> , and
coeﬃcients r-squared <r2> over the linear regression ﬁts of
the all 14 maps analyzed in this paper. The errors of these
averages are the standard deviation to their means.

se, is a measure of the typical residual from the least squares
line. It is given in the same units of the dependent variable of
the linear regression (kG). The correlation coeﬃcients r tell us
how well the data ﬁt into a linear regression, i.e. r is a mea-
sure of the extent to which the independent and the dependent

variable are linearly related. A linear regression is consid-
ered showing a strong linear relationship when 1<|r|<0.8, a
moderate linear relationship when 0.8<|r|<0.5, and a weak or
negligble relationship when 0.5<|r|≤0. r2 may be interpreted
as how much the data are spread with respect to the linear ﬁt:
High r2 represents a small spread, and vice versa. A linear
regression ﬁt with a low r2 implies a large range of values of
one variable (e.g. BHMI
) for a given value of the other vari-
able (e.g. BS P
X ). r2 also tells us how much of the variability of
one variable can be explained by its (linear) relationship with
the other. Therefore, r2 is also the fraction of variation that is

Y

shared between these variable. For instance, if r2 = 0.75, it is
said that a 75% of the total variance of the Y variable (BHMI
in
our example) is explained by the independent variable (BS P
X )
with the corresponding linear regression ﬁt.

In summary, the average values of se, r and r2 analyzed
in this article tell us, in a statistical sense, about the error of
the estimate, the goodness of the linear relationship, and the
percentage of the variation explained of the compared, ﬁtted
data using a linear regression ﬁt.

3. RESULTS

In section 3.1, we give the averaged values of the linear re-
gression ﬁt between the components of BHMI and BSP as
they are (case A). That section is based on the data released
by the respective projects to the public. We investigate the
impact of diﬀerent actors playing a role in the process of re-
covering the vector magnetic ﬁeld from the Stokes parame-
ters. We address that investigation through the comparison
between the HMI data and the pseudo-SP data (cases B to D),
and between SP data and pseudo-SP data (cases F to H) in
sections 3.2 and 3.3 respectively. Separately, in section 3.5,
we study the relationship between the apparent magnetic ﬂux
density and the total ﬂux between for the cases A to D.

In the main body text, we show and explain the statistical
values that support our results. Figures and tables showed
in the main body text are focused in the comparison between
HMI and SP. In the Appendix, we include the statistical tables
and other ﬁgures related with all the comparisons made in our
study.

3.1. Comparison between BHMI and BSP
We have compared the inversion results available at HMI
and SP databases. As we have mentioned before, the dis-
ambiguation is the only step not automatically provided with
the SP data. For HMI data, this step is easily implemented,
since JSOC provides automatically disambiguated inversions.
The assumptions behind the algorithm used are summarized
in Hoeksema et al. (2014). For the SP maps, we used AZAM
code to solve the disambiguation problem (see section D in
the Appendix for more details.

Figure 3 shows the linear regression ﬁts between the com-
ponents of the vector magnetic ﬁeld of HMI and SP for one in-
dividual map (lines and fonts in black). We have over-plotted
the averaged linear regression ﬁt over the 14 selected maps
(line and fonts in orange). The averaged linear regression ﬁts
between the components of BHMI and BSP in each of the
RoIs, and the averaged parameters described in the previous
section are given in detail in Table 3. They can be interpreted
as a translator between the vector magnetic ﬁeld observed by
one instrument to the other. Such data are listed for the RoIs
of every map of our data set (see section A).

On average, both in the umbra and penumbra the horizon-
tal components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld (BX and BY , all
values are given in kG units) show a slope very close to 1
(<b> ≥ 0.95), while for the longitudinal component (BZ) is
smaller (∼ 0.83 ± 0.05). In the next sections we will explore
this signiﬁcant discrepancy. The errors in the intercept for
the umbra are larger than for the penumbra, especially if we
compare them with the errors at the other RoIs (≤ 0.01). The
<r> and <r2> for these RoIs are very close to 1 for the hor-
izontal components and slightly smaller for the vertical com-
ponent. Therefore, we can say that the values of the compo-
nents of vector magnetic ﬁeld BHMI at the umbra and penum-
bra can be accurately predicted by BSP from the linear rela-
tionship showed in the ﬁrst six rows of Table 3.

In the strong plage, i.e. where 200 G < (| BHMI

XYZ | or | BSP
XYZ
|) < 1000 G, the <se> is 160G for the horizontal compo-
nents and 70 G for the vertical component with correlations
<r> ∼ 0.60, and 0.72 respectively. Although the errors of
<r> for the horizontal components are larger, what indicates
a large scattering of the r value of the individual comparisons
of the horizontal components. The percentage of variation
shared by the variables is <r2> ∼ 50% for the vertical com-
ponent. For the horizontal components, <r2> slightly smaller,
being 44% and 35% for the X and Y component respectively.

7

The averaged slope <b> for the horizontal components are
between 2 and 3 times larger than for the vertical compo-
nent. Therefore, the components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
at HMI can be predicted from those at SP and vice versa, with
a moderate conﬁdence.

Finally, in the weak plage, i.e. where (| BHMI

XYZ | or | BSP
XZY
|) < 200G, <se> for the horizontal components is ∼ 100G
and ∼ 50G for the vertical. The <r> for the horizontal com-
ponents shows only a weak linear relationship, while for the
vertical component the linear relationship is moderate. Only
around 15% of the variation of BHMI
XY may be explained from
BSP
XY , and 40% for the vertical component. The errors in all
the averaged statistical variables for the weak plage are small.
That means, the scattering of the individual statistical vari-
ables is small: there is a trend in these variables. On average,
the behavior in the weak plage, having a weak linear corre-
lation, is similar in all the individual maps. We have to be
careful with the interpretation of the small values of the er-
rors for the plage. The errors for the weak plage are smaller
than for the strong plage. However, the normalized variance,
i.e. the standard deviation divided by the average of the ﬁeld
values, is higher in the weak plage than in the strong plage, as
one may expect from a poorer S/N in the weak plage –because
of the low signal there–, with respect to the S/N in the strong
plage –where the signal is higher.

Table 4 compares the components of the vector magnetic
ﬁeld in spherical coordinates.
In this case, the weak and
strong plage are deﬁned as those pixels of the plage region
(pixels outside of the sunspot with Ptot > 0.005) where
(|B|HMI or |B|S P) < 200G and 200 < (|B|HMI or |B|S P) <
1500G respectively.

Fig. 4 shows, in the 1st and the 2nd column respectively,
the components of the magnetic ﬁeld of BHMI and BSP
of the maps compared through the scatter plots in Fig. 3.
In the top panels, from top to bottom, we show BX, BX, BZ
for the sunspot zoomed in. Similarly, in the bottom panels
we show the plage. We have masked the sunspot to empha-
size its values. A visual inspection of the maps qualitatively
shows the same quantitative results as in Table 3 does. The
values in the umbra and penumbra are very similar in the
1st and 2nd columns. All the components of the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld (especially in X and Y) in the region of the plage
closer to the sunspot are rather similar between them, but in
the outer part they are very diﬀerent. There is a region, be-
tween 30 < X((cid:48)(cid:48)) < 85 and 0 < Y((cid:48)(cid:48)) < 30, where there are
several solar features hosting diﬀerent sign between the val-
and BSP
ues observed by BHMI
– two circles point some
Y
of them out in the 5th row of the ﬁgure. These diﬀerences are
due to the manner in which the disambiguation algorithms
work on the diverse kinds of data explored here. In the SP
maps, the disambiguation results arise from the noisy Q and
U signals which in turn result from low values of the hori-
zontal ﬁeld components in the plage. This divides those maps
in two regions each with a dominant sign. Section D of the
Appendix proves that diﬀerent solutions provided by diﬀer-
ent disambiguation methods produce statistically similar re-
sults to the ones showed in Table 3, that is, in the compari-
son between the magnetic ﬁeld for HMI and SP. However, if
we would consider those pixels sharing the same sign – that
means, there where both disambiguation code yield the same
solution–, then the improvement of the correlation between
the horizontal components is important (e.g. the variation of
BHMI
XY would increase in about ∼ 35% in

the strong plage and ∼ 40% in the weak plage, see Table 18).
Figures 5 and 6 show a comparison of the components of
the BHMI and BSP in spherical coordinates for the sunspot
and plage respectively. The last row of these ﬁgures show the
disambiguated azimuth obtained from diﬀerent methods. A
detailed comparison of the solutions for the disambiguation is
given in the Appendix. However, at a glance, it is easy to see
an important result: the disambiguation method used has an
strong eﬀect to determine the vector magnetic ﬁeld, especially
in the plage. Thus, the values of ﬁeld strength (|B|), inclina-
tion (θB), and azimuth (φB) of the vector magnetic ﬁeld de-
rived from the data observed by HMI and SP are very similar
in the sunspot (1st and 2nd column of Fig. 5). However, those
values are quite diﬀerent in the plage. Notice BSP is com-
puted considering FF variable, while BHMI
is done with FF
equals to 1. Therefore, the components of the vector magnetic
ﬁeld in SP data may show values rather diﬀerent than the cor-
responding in HMI data. As we mentioned above, this eﬀect
is more notorious in the plage than in the umbra and penum-
bra, where the FF is close to 1. Thus, in the plage, there are

regions where |B| reaches values above 1 kG in the SP data
(in light green in the images of the 1st row of Fig. 5, and in
white in the images of the 1st row of Fig. 6). While for those
location the values are a few tens in HMI data (in dark violet
in those images). For that reason, in the Table 1, the values
of |B| in the weak and strong plage in the analyzed SP data
are showing a large range and a large dispersion, while the
analyzed HMI data show a tighter range and a smaller disper-
sion. As a consequence of the large diﬀerence in these values,
the linear relationship between |B|HMI and |B|S P in the plage
is close to 0 (see Table 4), and the linear correlation between
these values is very weak. However, when we consider |B|
with the inclination and azimuth, as we compose the vector
magnetic ﬁeld in the Cartesian coordinates, the relationships
between the components in that reference system (see Table
3) show a low relationship but diﬀerent than 0, and a mod-
erate and a weak linear correlation for the strong and weak
plage respectively.

and the plage (4th to 6th).

This section is devoted to understand the role played for
those actors which diﬀer between HMI and SP data. They are:
the spectral sampling, the spatial sampling, the spectral line,
the inversion code, the disambiguation code, and the ﬁlling
factor.

We call the modiﬁed SP maps pseudo-SP maps, and we
refer to them as S2H. Table 2 documents the calculated modi-
ﬁcations to the original SP data, and Section 2.3 oﬀers details
about these comparisons. The complete Table 10 in the Ap-
pendix, similar to the one used for the straightforward com-
parison, supports our ﬁndings.

The 3rd column in the panels of the Fig. 4 shows the com-
ponents of the vector magnetic ﬁeld as result of inverting the
SP data with FF=1. The 4th shows the S2H data inverted with
FF variable, i.e., the SP data are ﬁltered as HMI does, inverted
with VFISV and disambiguated as HMI does. The 5th column
of that ﬁgure shows the S2H data inverted similarly but with
FF=1. For a better visual comparison, HMI data are displayed
again in the last (6th) column. Figure 4, and Fig. 10 in the Ap-

pendix, visually summarize most of our ﬁndings.

Again, values of all the components of the vector magnetic
ﬁeld in the umbra and penumbra are very similar in all the
cases. In these RoIs, the FF of the original SP data is variable
but is very close to 1, so that the inversions assuming a FF=1
are not largely in error. The signal of the Stokes proﬁles is
much larger than the noise in these regions, therefore, even
with a sample of 6 spectral samples – as HMI does–, VFISV
is able to reproduce and ﬁt adequately the Stokes proﬁles, and
so to recover the same physical information as inversions us-
ing the full spectrum. The richness in the spatial structures of
the penumbra may be distinguished in the SPFF1, S2H and
S2HFF1 maps. A visual comparison of pseudo-SP maps with
the SP original data reveals a penumbra slightly blurrier, but
sharper than the equivalent HMI images. Therefore, the spa-
tial information, understood as the physical information by
pixel, remains despite of the spectral sampling (S2H maps)
or being inverted with FF ﬁxed to 1 (SPFF1 and S2HFF1).
The three components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld of SPFF1

and the plage (4th to 6th).

and S2HFF1 are visually closer to the ones observed by HMI
than the corresponding to SP and S2H. Therefore the treat-
ment of FF during the inversion seems to be more important
than the spectral sampling or the inversion code used. Note
that S2H and S2HFF1 data are inverted using VFISV and the
same disambiguation solution used by HMI, while SP and
SPFF1 data are inverted using MERLIN and a disambigua-
tion solution obtained with AZAM. In the moat – an annular
region around the sunspot mainly visible in the magnetograms
(Vrabec 1974) as the place where the moving magnetic fea-
tures (Harvey & Harvey 1973) run away from the penum-
bra as extension of the penumbral ﬁlaments (Sainz Dalda &
Mart´ınez Pillet 2005) – the sign of the horizontal components
seem to match in all the cases, so the disambiguation has not
an apparent eﬀect in that region, as it does not have in the
umbra and penumbra either.

Data for the plage are displayed in the bottom panel of Fig.

4. For the SPFF1 maps, we see the same eﬀect in the hori-
zontal components as for the SP data; half of the plage shows
a predominant sign, and the other half shows the opposite. It
is due to disambiguation solution chosen. Despite this visual
eﬀect, this has no impact in the statistical values of the com-
parison between the vector magnetic ﬁeld of HMI and SP (see
D in the Appendix). For the S2H and SH2FF1 data, as we are
using the same disambiguation solution that HMI, the sign of
the horizontal component matches with HMI in most of the
map. However, the sign in the solar feature located in the
circles in the HMI data (colored as blue and mixed blue-red)
seems to mach only with the S2H and S2HFF1 maps (blue and
mixed colors), but not with the SP and SPFF1 maps (hosting
red-colored values). These kind of regions, which were as-
signed with a diﬀerent sign by the disambiguation code have
an important impact in the correlation of the variables studied,
as we have proven in Section D of the Appendix.

12

Figure 4 allows us to appreciate visually the impact of the
FF, the spatial and the spectral sampling, and the disambigua-
tion in the comparison carried out in our study. Thus, HMI
maps (1st column) seem to match visually better with maps
on the far right: being the worse match with SP (2nd column),
the match is a bit better with SPFF1 (3rd column), becoming
acceptable with the S2H (4th column), and ﬁnally, with the
S2HFF1 ( 5th column), where the visual match seems to be
the best possible.

In the comparison between the spherical components (Figs.
5 and 6), we can appreciate that ﬁeld strength and inclination
of S2HFF1 (5th column) are very similar to the ones of HMI
(6th column). Nevertheless, for the azimuth, the pseudo-SP
maps are visually closer to SP data than to HMI. This is spe-
cially evident in the plage maps (see Fig. 6). We can see the
eﬀect introduced by the disambiguation method to calculate
the azimuth used to compose the horizontal components of
B in the last column of Fig. 6. We can visually distinguish
how close the disambiguated S2H azimuth data come to the
disambiguated HMI data (both using the same disambigua-
tion method denoted as ’DIS’), and how diﬀerent the disam-
biguated SP data are from the HMI DIS. Tables 10 and 15 in
the Appendix support these visual impressions for the disam-
biguation method used in the core of this paper, and others
method used to investigate this eﬀect: AZAM2 and AMBIG,
see D in the Appendix.

Averaged statistical values in the umbra and penumbra are
very similar in all the cases. The slope, <b> , of the linear
regression between vertical component of BHMI and the one
of the pseudo-SP maps, shows lower values (∼ 0.85 in the
umbra, and ∼ 0.90 in the penumbra) than for the horizontal
components (∼ 0.99). As noted above, a similar result was
found between BHMI
Z . Therefore, this behavior
must be due to other factor(s) than spectral sampling, ﬁlling
factor or the combination of both.

In the strong plage, the SPFF1 data can account for ∼ 20%
more of the variation of HMI than the basic SP data do. In
weak plage, the improvement is 9% for the horizontal com-
ponents, and 18% for the vertical component.
In the case
of S2H, where the improvement is only relevant for the X
component of the vector magnetic ﬁeld, BS2H
accounts for
∼ 30% more of the variation of BHMI
X . This im-
provement in X alone may be produced by a more accurate
sampling of the Stokes Q and/or U proﬁles than the Stokes V.
Again, the averages show that FF has a more important role
than the spectral sampling: more variation in BHMI data can
be explained with BSPFF1
In plages, a
combination of both FF and the spectral sampling improves
all the statistical correlations. Values of <r> for X and Y
are 0.92 and 0.84 respectively, while for the Y component is
very close (0.72). The <r> for the X and Z components are
0.78 and 0.76 respectively. For the Y component, the <r> is
smaller, 0.42. In the strong plage, the X and Z component of
S2HFF1 are respectively able to explain 84% and 72% of the
variation of HMI, i.e. 40% and 18% more than SP does. For
the weak plage, these values are ∼ 60%, that means a 43%
more for X, and 17% more for Z than for SP. The percent-
ages for Y are sightly slower than the percentages of the case
SPFF1, but larger than the ones of the case S2H.

than with BS2H .

In the Y maps of Fig. 4, we have pointed out some struc-
tures with diﬀerent sign in the SP data with respect to the HMI
and S2H maps. A region with a strong signal in the plage
is present in all the SP and pseudo-SP maps. However, in

HMI these structures cannot be distinguished (colored in light
green, grey, and light blue.) That region is pointed out by an
ellipse in the Y map of the plage for the case S2HFF1. There,
the values are predominantly negative (blue) in the SP and
SPFF1 maps, while it is mixed (blue and red) in the S2H and
S2HFF1 maps. Thus, the low, mixed values of that region in
the HMI map are correlated with values in the SP and SPFF1
maps having a same sign, while for S2H and S2HFF1 maps,
the HMI values are correlating with mixed values, therefore,
introducing a slight spread in the correlation. That is not the
case in the X and Z component, where most of the solar struc-
tures seem to share the same sign in all the maps, although
they may be more intense in the SP and the pseudo-SP maps
than in the HMI ones (e.g., red in the former, yellow in the
latter).

Table 16 in the Appendix shows the correlation between the
spherical components of BHMI and BS2H/S2HFF1 . The rela-
tionships for ﬁeld strength, inclination and azimuth are very
similar to the ones obtained for the comparison between HMI
and SP. However, for the disambiguated azimuth the diﬀer-
ence is important, especially in the plage. For the strong and
weak plage, the linear relationship between the disambiguated
data of HMI and S2H/S2HFF1 is ∼ 0.8 and ∼ 0.7, with similar
values for <r> . The reason for that moderately high values
is the disambiguation code used with the S2H and S2HFF1,
which is the same that HMI uses (denoted as DIS). Observing
the 3rd row of Fig. 6, one may see a diﬀerence between the az-
imuth recovered from either SP/SPFF1 or S2H/S2HFF1 data
with respect to HMI. , the azimuth is very similar between SP
and SPFF1, and between S2H and S2HFF1.

An inspection in the pre-disambiguation azimuth maps in
the 3rd column of Fig. 6 reveals of locations previously
pointed out an interesting result: the values of the structures at
these selected regions are very similar, with a little variation
in the intensity of the colors in the main structures enclosed
in circles or the ellipse. Thus, in the circle located in the left
side, the values of the main structure seems to be red with
a blue dot in the middle, both in HMI and SP, while in the
structure located in the circle at right side, it is blue in the
bottom and red in the top in both instruments. Similar cor-
respondence is found in the complex structure located in the
ellipse. In all the cases, the azimuth values are rather diﬀerent
in those pixels not related with a structure, i.e. with a location
having a signiﬁcant S/N. Therefore, the diﬀerence observed
in the Y maps in those selected structures is due to the dis-
ambiguation, since they share similar values of the azimuth
before the disambiguation is applied. In structures where the
S/N of the instruments may be very diﬀerent –mainly in the
weak plage–, the pre-disambiguation azimuth in those instru-
ments may diﬀer between each other. As we will see in the
next section, this diﬀerence (and similarity) can be only ex-
plained in terms of the diﬀerent S/N of the Stokes Q and U
of one instrument with respect to the other one, and cannot be
assigned to other actor in the comparison.

3.3. Comparison between SP and pseudo-SP data
Here, we compare the SP data with the pseudo-SP data,
which same spatial sampling and the same observed spec-
tral line. These comparisons correspond to cases E to H de-
scribed above. The linear regression ﬁts for all these cases are
presented in Table 11 (Cartesian components) and Table 12
(spherical coordinates) in the Appendix. Cases E and F share
all the actors, except the FF. Note that some actors are diﬀer-
ent between the case E and F, e.g. the inversion code in case

E is MERLIN, while for the case F is VFISV.

The values of <b> , <r> , and <r2> for the cases E and F
inform us about the role of the FF. Thus, for case E, both in
the strong and weak plage, the values of <b> for the horizon-
tal components are as large as twice the vertical components.
This behavior is similar for case F. The values of <r2> tell
us that the diﬀerence between considering the FF variable or
ﬁxed equal to 1 in the same data, e.g. SPFF1 vs SP, is intro-
ducing a reduction in the explained variation of the variable
inverted with FF equals to 1, e.g. SPFF1, with respect to the
one considering FF variable, e.g. SP. This reduction is ∼ 20%
and ∼ 35% in the strong and weak plage respectively for the
components in the Cartesian coordinates (see Table 11).

A visual comparison between the 2nd and 3rd column (case
E) or between the 4th and the 5th column (case F) of Fig.
4 conﬁrms these results. The plage (botton panels) of the
3rd and 5th column seems to contain visually less solar struc-
tures than in the 2nd and 4th respectively.

Z

The cases G and H simulate the comparison between S2H
and SP. Since S2HFF1 data are the closest one to HMI, we
compare them with the SP data inverted with FF variable and
ﬁxed to 1. In these comparisons, we are using data with shar-
ing a common line (Fe I 6302Å)) and the same spatial reso-
lution, but with diﬀerent sampling, diﬀerent inversion code,
diﬀerent treatment of the FF in the ICs, and diﬀerent disam-
biguation algorithm. The statical values in the comparison
between BS2HFF1 and BSP have rather similar results at each
RoI to the corresponding ones in the comparison between the
BHMI and BSP , except for the vertical component. In this
case, the values of <b> for the horizontal components in the
linear regression ﬁt between BS2HFF1
are much
closer between them than in the linerar regression between
BHMI and BSP . That is signiﬁcant in the plage, where the
ratio between the averaged slopes in the horizontal compo-
nents and the vertical becomes very close to 1, while for the
comparison between the original HMI and SP data is 2:1. In
the umbra and penuumbra, the values of <b> for the verti-
cal component are 0.96 ± 0.04 and 0.91 ± 0.03 respectively,
i.e., the diﬀerence with respect to comparison between HMI
and SP is notable (0.82 ± 0.06 and 0.84 ± 0.05 respectively).
Again, if we considered the SP treated with a FF ﬁxed to 1,
all the statistical values associated to the linear regression ﬁt
are improved, and particularly the ones corresponding to the
vertical component, which become very close to 1 in all the
RoIs, including the strong and weak plage.

and BSP
Z

As we mentioned above, the azimuth of SP/SPFF1 and
S2H/S2HFF1 are very similar, even when the inversion code
used for the former cases is MERLIN, and for the latter cases
is VFISV. Both codes are Milne-Eddington, but they may have
a diﬀerent treatment of the weights of the Stokes parameters
in their inversion scheme. Despite that fact, the azimuths are
very similar, both in the sunspot (see Fig. 5) and in the plage
(see Fig. 6). The signiﬁcant diﬀerence comes in the relation-
ship for |B|. The linear relationships for the spherical coordi-
nates are shown in Table 12.

The only diﬀerence between the data compared in the
1st and 2nd sub-tables, i.e. for the case E (SPFF1 vs SP) and
F (S2HFF1 vs S2H), is the FF used to recover B . The data
compared share all the other actors (including same S/N) and
use the same inversion code to recover B (MERLIN for case
E, VFISV for case F). The corresponding sub-tables in Table
12 show: a strong linear correlation between all the compo-
nents in the sunspot; moderate in the inclination and azimuth

13

in the plage; and low in the strong plage and very low (<b> =
0.04) in the weak plage. All these eﬀects are strictly pro-
duced for how the FF was considered during the inversion of
the data. Neither the spatial sampling nor the spectral sam-
pling nor the S/N nor the inversion code play a role in the
diﬀerences shown in these sub-tables.

It is interesting to compare the statistical values obtained for
the comparison between SPFF1 and SP, and those obtained for
the comparison between S2HFF1 and S2H (see Table 11 and
12). All the statistical values (<a> , <b> , <se> , <r> , and
<r2> ), in all the RoIs, are rather similar between these two
comparisons. That means, the eﬀect of considering a FF ﬁxed
to 1 versus considering it variable in the same data is simi-
lar, whether the data set has been sampled with a ﬁne spec-
tral sampling (SP/SPFF1) or with a coarse spectral sampling
(S2H/S2HFF1). We observe the same behavior in the two
ﬁrst sub-tables of these tables, when the comparison is made
between the Cartesian components of B . That means, the
combination of spectral sampling and disambiguation is not
introducing a strong eﬀect in these comparisons. After these
results, we may be tempted to consider to use a FF variable in
data sampled with a coarse spectral sampling. We shall show
that may be a wrong decision.

For the cases G and H (sub-tables 3rd and 4th) the linear
relationship between for |B|, θB and φB obtained in the umbra
and penumbra by S2H and SP is very high, showing a strong
correlation. In the plage the statistical values are showing a
moderate relationship for the inclination and the azimuth in
all the comparisons (cases E to H). However, the <b> and
<r> for the relationship of |B| on all these cases are very low,
except for the comparison between S2HFF1 and SPFF1. Only
when we consider the FF equals to 1 in both data set (last sub-
table), the statistical values improve.

On the other hand, when we consider FF variable in both
data set (3rd sub-table), we obtain low statistical values, and
not too diﬀerent than for the previous sub-tables, even when
in this case (G) we are comparing data inverted with diﬀerent
code. As we mentioned above, the eﬀects on the relationship
between the components of BS2H and BS2HFF1 seem to be
the same that for comparison between BSP and BSPFF1 .
We feel tempted to interpret this results as an evidence that
calculating the vector magnetic ﬁeld on data sampled coarsely
considering a FF variable as we do with SP – i.e. data with a
ﬁne spectral sampling data, and a stray light proﬁle calculated
as the averaged Intensity proﬁle where the Ptot is smaller than
35% –is not a good approach. However, we should keep in
mind that for an instrument where the S/N is not as good as
for SP data, the situation may be diﬀerent. We think a further
investigation about the role played by the stray light, other
way(s) to calculate it, and use it in the FF on data coarsely
sampled, as HMI data are, may be very helpful.

As a conclusion, comparing vector magnetic ﬁeld recov-
ered from inversions considering a diﬀerent treatment of the
FF (FF variable versus FF ﬁxed to 1) reveals a small linear
relationship for the |B| in the plage. Notice the data compared
in the 3rd and 4th sub-tables of Tables 11 and 12 (S2H vs SP
and S2HFF1 vs SPFF1 respectively) have the same tempo-
ral and spatial sampling (no co-alignment is needed), and the
same S/N. The diﬀerences between them are the spectral sam-
pling, the spectral lines considered (since S2H data only use
Fe I 6302Å), and the inversion code used to obtain B . Since
these data share the same S/N, we conclude the diﬀerence in
|B| in the plage for these cases is due to the combination of

One question remains open from the previous sections: in
the umbra and penumbra, why are the values of <b> for the
horizontal component closer to 1 than for the vertical compo-
nent? Thus, for the straight comparison between BHMI
and
BSP
Z the <b> is 0.82 in the umbra, and 0.84 in the penumbra.
As we mentioned above, these values are slightly higher in
the comparisons between HMI and the pseudo-SP maps, but
they are still far of 1 (the closest one is for the comparison
, with <b> = 0.93). Table 11
between BHMI
sheds light on that question. The values of <b> for the verti-
cal component in the cases considered in this section and pre-
sented in that table are very close to 1, both in the umbra and
penumbra. The comparisons between the vertical component
observed by SP and pseudo-SP show a little deviation from
1 (between 0.09 and 0.01, although in average it is 0.04). In
fact, for the comparison between the horizontal components
BHMI
XY , we obtained a deviation of <b> from 1 in a
XY
similar range of values (between 0.05 and 0.01). That means,
the statistical values for the vertical components in the linear
regression ﬁt for the cases E to H are similar to the ones for
the horizontal components in the comparison between HMI
and SP.

It is diﬃcult to isolate the roles of the spectral sampling
and FF for the cases E to H because <b> for these cases are
too close to one another, and to 1. Nevertheless, we can say
that in comparing SP and pseudo-SP maps, i.e. observing the
same spectral line, <b> is ∼ 1 in the umbra and penumbra no
matters what the sampling, the inversion code or the treatment
given to the FF are. However, for the plage, the case H tells
us that giving the same treatment of the FF ﬁxed to 1 makes
that statistical value gets close to 1 for the vertical compo-
nent, and increases the corresponding ones for the horizontal
components, although the latter are still far from 1.

One possible scenario might explain the values of <b> in
the comparison between BHMI
Z . In an ideal ver-
tical ﬂux tube in the photosphere, the magnetic ﬁeld strength
observed along the line of sight decreases as it expands in the
higher layers. Thus, if the region where the spectral line Fe I
6302 Å is sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld is slightly lower than
the region where the line Fe I 6173 Å is, then SP would ob-
served a slightly stronger magnetic ﬁeld than the one observed
by HMI.

Fleck et al. (2011) calculated the height formation of Fe I
6173 Å cross-correlating Doppler velocities observed by HMI
with 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Taking into ac-
count the spatial resolution of the HMI Dopplergrams, the
authors found the formation height of Fe I 6173 Å is about
140 − 150 km. On the other hand, several studies found the
height formation for Fe I 6302 Å in higher layers of the photo-
sphere. Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno (2001) found the height
where the LTE optical depth at the line center is τline = 1
for Fe I 6302 Å to be 400 km and 350 km for a granule and
intergranule, respectively. Grec et al. (2010) found the line
formation height located between 138 to 201 km for above
the continuum formation height, and the height where optical
depth is 1 for this line to be 244 km. Faurobert et al. (2012),
found a variation of the formation height from 200 km in the
disk center to 470 km close to the limb. In all these cases, the
formation height of Fe I 6302 Å is higher than for Fe I 6173

Expressions such as “a spectral line is formed at a partic-
ular height in the solar atmosphere”, or in the best case, “a
spectral line is formed within a given region” are an over-
simpliﬁcation of complex 3D physics (Judge et al. 2015). It
is more precise to say “a spectral line is sensitive to a phys-
ical parameter in the region ranging from A to B”, where A
and B are values of height given in an appropriate scale, e.g.,
geometrical or optical depth, and/or within a certain kind of
magnetic structure (ﬂux tube versus intergranular lane, for
example). Several authors have addressed such ideas (Del
Toro Iniesta & Ruiz Cobo 1996; S´anchez Almeida & Landi
Degl’Innocenti 1996) by making use of response functions
(RFs, Mein 1971; Beckers & Milkey 1975; Ruiz Cobo & del
Toro Iniesta 1994). The RF is deﬁned as the variation of a
Stokes parameter with respect the variation of a physical at-
mospheric parameter at a given optical depth and wavelength.
Borrero et al. (2014) compared the results obtained from three
Milne-Eddington ICs with 3D MHD numerical simulations.
The authors concluded that using generalized RFs to deter-
mine the height at which Milne-Eddington ICs measure phys-
ical parameters is more meaningful than comparisons of in-
verted parameters at a ﬁxed height.

We have computed the RF of Stokes V to the magnetic ﬁeld
strength for those spectral lines using the SIR IC (Ruiz Cobo
& del Toro Iniesta 1992). That code computes the RFs under
the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, what is
appropriate for the spectral lines investigated in this paper.

Figure 7 shows the behavior of temperature and the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength with respect to the logarithm of the contin-
uum optical depth at 5000Å. The following panels show the
normalized RF of Stokes V to |B| (NRFV
|B|) for Fe I 6302 Å
calculated using these models. The RF has been normalized
to the maximum value of the RF of Stokes I to |B|. The thick
contours delimit where the |NRFV
|B|| for Fe I 6302 Å is greater
than 0.2. The dash-lined contours do for the NRFV
|B| calculated
for Fe I 6173Å. Figure 7 shows that the region (expressed in
log(τc)) where those lines are sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld
strength are basically the same. The one corresponding to
HMI extends a bit farther to higher layers, but just in the tail
of the distribution of the NRF. The letters ”H” and ”S” pointed
out the location of the minimum and maximum of the NRFV
|B|
for HMI and SP respectively. These locations either overlap
one to each other (cool umbra) or are signiﬁcantly close in
log(τ) and/or in spectral axis. The region where those lines
are sensitive to |B| is basically the same. The Stokes V proﬁle
for Fe I 6302 Å synthesized from the atmospheres used in this
study, and the instrumental proﬁles used by HMI and in the
pseudo-SP maps displayed as reference at the corresponding
wavelength. One can argue about the diﬀerence in the spectral
sampling used by the instruments. However, the comparison
between SP and S2H does not show a such a signiﬁcant dif-
ference between the <b> for the horizontal components and
the vertical one in the umbra and penumbra, being all the val-
ues very close to 1. Therefore, we are not able to explain
why BHMI
observes ∼ 0.85 times the apparent longitudinal
component of the magnetic ﬁeld observed by SP, BSP
Z .

We may speculate about the eﬀects introduced by the main
contributors in the RF of the Stokes V to the magnetic ﬁeld
strength following the analysis made by Cabrera Solana et al.
(2005). The authors calculated the expression RFV
|B| based in
a phenomenological model for the weak spectral lines. In the

those factors might change the response of the Stokes V to
a variation in the magnetic ﬁeld strength. Thus, the param-

3.4. Comparison Between the Apparent Longitudinal

Magnetic Flux (Bapp), Total Magnetic Flux (Φ), and
unsigned magnetic ﬂux ((cid:98)Φ), observed by HMI and SP. .
We have studied the apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux
11, observed by HMI and SP, being Bapp = FF ×
density, Bapp
|B| × cosφB, and expressed in Mx/cm2. We follow the no-
tation and the conceptual interpretation given by Berger &
Lites (2003), i.e.: “we denote calibrated magnetic ﬂux den-
sity quantities as B app, the apparent magnetic ﬂux density
measured by instrument X, in order to emphasize the inherent

11 The interested reader may ﬁnd a good explanation about the magnetic
ﬁeld strength, magnetic ﬂux and magnetic ﬂux density in Keller et al. (1994).
In this paper, for the sake of clarity, we use Bapp to refer the apparent longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬂux density, instead of BL
app, which has been used by other
authors.

Table 5 shows the averaged statistical values of the linear
regression between the apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux
measured by HMI and the one measured by SP in the RoIs. In
addition, we present a similar comparison between HMI and
the pseudo-SP maps in Table 13 in the Appendix, i.e. for the
cases A to D in Table 2. It is obvious that in those cases where
the FF is equal to one, the relationship between the BHMI
app and
, is the same as the one between the BHMI
BS PFF1
app
and BSPFF1
respectively (see Table 10).

In the umbra and penumbra, the statistical values for the
cases A to D are very similar, except for the averaged slope
<b> in the comparison between BHMI
. The other
statistical values show a very strong linear relationship be-
tween the apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux density of the
data compared, without a clear impact because of considering
a diﬀerent spectral line, spectral sampling, spatial sampling,
ﬁlling factor or the other actors evaluated in the comparison.
The apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux observed by HMI in
the umbra and penumbra is 84% and 95% respectively of the
one observed by SP. The inﬂuence of FF in the calculation of
Bapp is evident in the penumbra, where it is close to 1, but
mostly diﬀerent than 1, for the SP, while it is virtually equal
to 1 everywhere in the umbra for the SP. Therefore, the rela-
tion BHMI
app in the umbra is similar to the relationship
and BSP
between BHMI
Z in that RoI. The <se> in both RoIs
is ∼ 90Mx/cm2.

app and BS P

In the plage, the situation is slightly diﬀerent. Again, the
maps which consider a FF variable show lower averaged slope
and lower averaged statistical values than the ones with a FF
equal to 1. Although, that diﬀerent behavior in the relation-
ship of the Bapp observed by the maps with a diﬀerent FF is
little (e.g., less than 10% in <b> ). Therefore, the linear re-
lationship between the Bapp observed in the plage by HMI,
both the strong and the weak plage, and the one observed by
SP is moderate. In the strong and weak plage, HMI observes
32% of the apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux observed by
SP, following a high-moderate linear relationship. The FF has
a little impact in that relationship in the plage, while the other
factors do not seem to play an important role in it. The <se> in
the strong plage is ∼ 90Mx/cm2, and ∼ 50Mx/cm2 in the
weak plage.

Z

Since the errors in the averaged slope and the statistical val-
ues in all the RoIs are small, we can conclude that the behav-
ior in the relationship between BHMI
app is consistent

0.7 < µ < 1, the relationship between BHMI
app is strong
in the umbra and penumbra, being in the plage moderate in the
high range.

app and BS P

The sub-table in the middle of Table 5 shows the relation-

ship between the total magnetic ﬂux Φ observed by HMI and
SP. Similarly, we have done that comparison between HMI
and the pseudo-SP maps (see sub-table in the bottom of Ta-
ble 13 in the Appendix).
In these comparisons, one linear
regression ﬁt is calculated for each RoIs of the 14 analyzed

maps. As in the rest of this paper, the RoIs are the areas of the
umbra, penumbra, plage with a strong ﬁeld, and plage with a
weak ﬁeld. As all the maps, after being corrected to match to
each other, they share the same spatial scale. Therefore, the
area used to calculate the total ﬂux in the (compared) maps
is the same. Of course, the value of the magnetic ﬁeld inside
these areas is what diﬀers from one map to the other. Figure
8 shows the values for the total magnetic ﬂux for the RoIs
observed by HMI, SP and the pseudo-SP maps and the linear
regression ﬁt between them. The values of Φ in the panels of
Fig. 8 and in Table 13 are expressed in 1021Mx. Note that in
this case, we are doing the linear regression ﬁt over 14 values
corresponding to the 14 studied maps. Therefore, the inter-
cept, slope and statistical values (se, r, r2) are not average val-
ues since they correspond to only one linear ﬁt. The errors in
the intercept and the slope are the standard errors deﬁned for
a linear regression ﬁt. The errors of se, r, r2 are the rounding
error in these values.

HMI observes 93 ± 1% of the total magnetic ﬂux observed
by SP (ΦS P) in the umbra. However, for the penumbra, HMI
overestimates in 14 ± 5% the ΦS P. The statistical values show
a very strong linear relationship between ΦHMI and ΦS P both
in the umbra and penumbra. Similar behavior is observed in
the comparison between ΦHMI and the total magnetic ﬂux of
the pseudo-SP maps (see Table 13). In the strong and weak
plage, HMI observes ∼ 30% of the total magentic ﬂux ob-
served by SP. However, in the strong plage the correlation
is moderate, while in the weak plage the correlation is very
strong (<r> = 0.96 ± 0.01). Similar behavior is observed in
the comparison between ΦHMI and the pseudo-SP maps.

In the bottom of Table 5, we show the comparison between
the unsigned total magnetic ﬂux measured by HMI, (cid:98)ΦHMI and
the one measured by SP, (cid:98)ΦS P, in the diﬀerent RoIs. The val-
ues for the umbra and penumbra are very similar to the ones
In these RoIs, as we
presented for the total magnetic ﬂux.
have proven in Section 3.1, the magnetic ﬁeld vector observed
by HMI and SP are very similar (see top panels in Fig. 4).
The most striking value in the comparison between (cid:98)ΦHMI and
(cid:98)ΦS P are the ones corresponding to the strong plage. There,
the slope, <b> , is 0.08 ± 0.05, and the variation of (cid:98)ΦHMI ex-
plained by that relationship is around just the 20%. The values
for the weak plage are slightly larger. The sub-table in the bot-
tom of Table 13 in the Appendix shows similar comparisons
between the unsigned total magnetic ﬂux measured by HMI
and the one measured by SPFF1, S2H and S2HFF1. Those
comparisons may help us to understand what happens in the
plage for the comparison between (cid:98)ΦHMI and (cid:98)ΦS P. The sta-
tistical values for the comparison between (cid:98)ΦHMI and (cid:98)ΦS PFF1
and (cid:98)ΦS 2HFF1 in the strong plage are larger than those consid-
ering FF variable, but they are still considerably smaller than
the corresponding ones in the weak plage. If we look in de-
tail the vertical component of the map showed in Fig. 4, we
can many pixels showing strong values (dark blue and dark
red) in the SP and S2H maps that they are associated with
smaller values in HMI (and in SPFF1 and S2HFF1). While
the slopes in the relationships between BHMI
for
the strong and weak plage are similar (<b> ∼ 0.15), the to-
tal sum of the unsigned ﬂux in the locations showing strong
values in SP shall be signiﬁcantly larger than for the same lo-
cations at HMI, and a bit smaller if we consider FF ﬁxed to
1. On the other hand, those locations showing weak values in
HMI, i.e. the weak plage, have also associated weak values in

and BSP

SP. Therefore, the correlation between the total ﬂux is better
for the weak values, i.e. the weak plage, than for the strong
values, i.e. the strong plage. Thus, the <r> values are again,
as for Φ, larger for the weak plage than for the strong plage.
In addition, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the <r> values
in the strong and the weak plage may be due to the diﬀerence
in the area deﬁned as strong plage in the HMI maps and the
one deﬁned in the SP and S2H maps.

3.5. Comparison Between the Apparent Longitudinal

Magnetic Flux (Bapp), Total Magnetic Flux (Φ), and
unsigned magnetic ﬂux ((cid:98)Φ), observed by SP and
pseudo-SP data.
In this section, we discuss the comparison of Bapp, Φ, and (cid:98)Φ
obtained for SP, SPFF1, S2H and S2H data, i.e. correspond-
ing to the comparisons E to H of Table 2. The comparison of
those magnitudes for the case E (SP vs SPFF1) is particularly
interesting, and they are shown in Table 6. Notice that the
only diﬀerence between SP and SPFF1 is the way the FF was
considered during the inversion od the Stokes proﬁles, being
variable for the SP data, and ﬁxed to 1 for SPFF1. All other
actors are exactly the same.

app

The apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux in the umbra is
similar either considering FF ﬁxed to one or variable. As we
have mentioned, in the umbra the values of FF, when it is con-
sidered variable, are virtually equal to 1 in most of the pixels,
and close, but diﬀerent, to 1 in the penumbra. In this RoI, the
BS PFF1
shows an overestimation of 6% with respect to BS P
app.
app
On the plage, things are diﬀerent. Considering the FF ﬁxed
to 1 produce an underestimation in the apparent longitudinal
magnetic ﬂux BS PFF1
of ∼ 18% and ∼ 26% in the strong and
weak plage with respect to the case considering a FF variable,
BS P
app.
For the total magnetic ﬂux and the total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux, we observe a similar behavior, i.e. a small overestima-
tion (∼ 5%) for the relationship of those magnitudes in the
penumbra, and an important underestimation in the strong
(∼ 60% for both magnitudes) and weak (∼ 60% for Φ, and
∼ 45% for (cid:98)Φ) plage when considering a FF ﬁxed to 1 instead
of being variable. That means, the underestimation in these
magnitudes in the plage appears (in this comparison) only be-
cause of the way the inversion is made, i.e. how the FF is
considered. Therefore, we have to keep in mind this eﬀect
when we compare those magnitudes for HMI (FF ﬁxed to 1)
and SP (FF variable) data in Table 6.

To evaluate the eﬀect of other actors, we have made the
comparison of these magnitudes between SP and pseudo-SP
data, as are described to the case E to H in Section 2.3. The
statistical values of these comparison are showed in the Ta-
ble 14 of the Appendix. We can compare the values corre-
sponding to the case G (S2HFF1 vs SP) with the values of
the case A (HMI vs SP, Table 5), since the S2HFF1 are the
closest data to HMI. Thus, if we take the pair of values of
<b> (%) for the relationship of those magnitudes at the strong
and weak plage in the case A as <b> (strong/weak plage)
[Bapp = 32/32, φ = 27/32, (cid:98)φ = 8/15 ], while for the case
G is <b> (strong/weak plage) [Bapp = 79/72, φ = 54/64, (cid:98)φ =
55/50]. The diﬀerence between these values may be explained
in terms of the diﬀerent actors not included either in the com-
parison A or G, that means: the spatial sampling, the spectral
line and the S/N. In other words, the largest diﬀerence comes
from considering the FF variable or ﬁxed to 1, then the spec-

tral sampling, ﬁnally the other actors. As we have showed in
the Section 3.3.1, the lines observed by HMI and SP shows a
similar response variation to the magnetic ﬁeld, so we should
expect a similar magnetic ﬂux observed by those lines. We
have to concluded that the spatial resolution and the S/N are
the last actors (in importance) in the list of contributors to the
diﬀerence in the comparison of Bapp, φ, and (cid:98)φ.

4. CONCLUSIONS
We have compared the vector magnetic ﬁeld observed by
HMI with the one observed by SP. In addition, we have used
pseudo-SP data to know about the role played for the actors
what diﬀer between the original HMI and SP data sets. These
actors are summarized in Table 2. We have to admit that other
actors may introduce an eﬀect in an eventual comparison be-
tween HMI and SP data, e.g.: the temporal evolution of solar
structures during the scan of SP. Thus, while we have done
our best to analyze, explain and quantify the eﬀects of the ac-
tors mentioned in the Table 2, we cannot guarantee that other
actors may introduce an eﬀect in our results. However, in a
comparisons between HMI and SP data similar to the ones
used in this study (temporal sampling, solar structures in the
ﬁeld of view, S/N, etc.), we expect similar results to the ones
found in this study.

Our results are divided in two parts. On one side, the results
concerning to the data available to the public as they are. On
the other side, the results that provide a better understanding
of the instrumental and treatment eﬀects on the original data.
Since, we have applied the same methodology – a linear re-
gression ﬁt – to the analyzed data set (14 quasi-simultaneous
maps of NOAA AR 11084), our results must be understood in
a statistical sense. Our study has been carried out comparing
the Cartesian and the spherical components of the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld obtained from one instrument to the other. Through
the comparison of the spherical components, we earn a better
understanding of the eﬀect introduced by the disambiguation
of the azimuth. All our results are referred to both system
of coordinates, since they are complementary and consistent
between them, but here we summarize them referring to the
Cartesian coordinates.

Table 3 and 4 show the linear relationship between the com-
ponents – Cartesian and spherical respectively– of the vector
magnetic ﬁeld BHMI and BSP in four diﬀerent regions: um-
bra, penumbra, plage with a strong magnetic ﬁeld, and plage
with a weak magnetic ﬁeld. The values of the straightfor-
ward comparison, the averaged statistical values and the er-
rors found for those relationships. Similarly, Table 5 shows
the relation between the apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux,
the signed and unsigned total magnetic ﬂux measured by HMI
and SP. Here, in the sake of simplicity, we present our ﬁndings
as an approximation of those values. While Tables 3, 4 and 5
represent the main ﬁndings of this investigation –visually sup-
ported by Figs. 4, 5 and 6 –, we summarize here the physical
meaning of our results.

Table 1 shows the ranges of the values in the RoIs com-
pared in this study. We have to consider our results valid in
those intervals, and diﬀerent behavior may happen in regions
with diﬀerent ranges of values. For instance, larger cool um-
brae with higher magnetic ﬁeld strengths than the one used
in this study may present molecular spectral bands that likely
inﬂuence MERLIN or VFISV magnetic ﬁeld inversions.

In the umbra and penumbra, the components of the vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld observed by HMI and SP are very similar.
They are showing a strong linear correlation, having an av-
eraged slope very close to 1 for the horizontal components
and ∼ 0.83 for the vertical component. After a detailed study,
we can only speculate about the origin of that diﬀerence in
the averaged slope. We feel inclined to believe that diﬀerence
comes from the spectral sampling of HMI and the uncertainty
introduced by sampling the Stokes V proﬁle, therefore the re-
gion where the atmosphere is sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld.
The averaged standard deviation about the least squares line
for the components of the predicted BHMI , <se> , is ∼ 100G
both in the umbra and penumbra. In the umbra, the apparent
longitudinal magnetic ﬂux observed by HMI, BHMI
app , is 84%
of the one observed by SP, BS P
app ob-
serves 95% of BS P
app. In both RoIs, the relationship between
these variables is very strong (∼ 0.98). The signed and un-
signed total ﬂux measured by HMI is underestimating the one

app. In the penumbra, BHMI

measured by SP in the umbra in about ∼ 7%, and overesti-
mating it in the penumbra about ∼ 14%.

For the plage hosting strong magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., in those
pixels in the plage where 200G < (| BHMI
XYZ |) <
1000G, we have found a moderate linear relationship between
XYZ and BSP
BHMI
XYZ . The averaged standard deviation about the
least squares line for the predicted BHMI
is ∼ 160G for the
horizontal components, and 70G for the vertical component.
The linear relationships found are able to explain about 40%
of the variation of the predicted BHMI
XY and 50% for the BHMI
. The errors in the averaged slope and the averaged statisti-
cal parameters of the horizontal components are signiﬁcantly
larger than the errors for the vertical component. That means,
the distribution of those parameters for the 14 maps is more
scattered for the horizontal components than for the vertical
one. In the plage, HMI measures 32% of the apparent longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬂux measured by SP, with an averaged stan-
dard deviation about the least squares line for the predicted
BHMI
app is 90Mx/cm2. Both the apparent magnetic ﬂux and the
(signed) total magnetic ﬂux measured by HMI and SP show
a strong linear correlation, while the unsigned total magnetic
ﬂux shows a weak correlation with a very small slope ∼ 0.08.
In other words, in the strong plage HMI measures just 8% of
the unsigned total magnetic ﬂux observed by SP in that RoI.
For the plage where the magnetic ﬁeld is weak, i.e., in those
pixels in the plage where (| BHMI
XYZ |) < 200G, the
relationship between BHMI
XY is weak, while between
BHMI
is moderate. The averaged standard devia-
Z
tion about the least squares line for the predicted BHMI
is
100G for the horizontal components, and 50G for the vertical
component. Note the large values of <se> for the horizontal
components, meaning that there is a large scatter around the
least squares line. The errors in the averaged slope and the
averaged statistical parameters of the horizontal components
are signiﬁcantly larger than the errors of the vertical compo-
nent. That is, the distribution of those parameters for the 14
maps is more scattered for the horizontal components than
for the vertical one. In the weak plage, the linear relationship
between BHMI
app is high-moderate, while the relation-
ships between ΦHMI and ΦS P, and between (cid:98)ΦHMI and (cid:98)ΦS P are
very strong. The averaged standard deviation about the least
squares line for BHMI

From the comparison between HMI and the psesudo-SP
maps, we conclude that the actor having a major impact in
the statistical values analyzed is the ﬁlling factor, followed by
the spectral sampling, and ﬁnally the spatial sampling. The ef-
fect introduced by the FF is important especially in the plage.
Thus, if the magnetic ﬁeld observed by HMI and the corre-
sponding for SP where both calculated with an inversion con-
sidering FF equal to 1, the improvement in the explained vari-
ation of HMI by SP would be of ∼ 20% in the strong plage
for all the components of BHMI , and 9% and 19% for the
horizontal and vertical components respectively in the weak
plage. The improvements in the explained variation of corre-
sponding predicted variables are larger between HMI and the
maps of SP sampled as HMI does (both S2H and S2HFF1)
than between HMI and SPFF1. However, the slope for the
horizontal component are worse than for the comparison be-
tween HMI and SP with FF=1. The biggest improvements
in all the statistical values comes from considering both FF
equal to 1 and same spectral sampling between HMI and SP,
i.e. when the SP data become closest to HMI data.

19

app

Considering the FF ﬁxed to 1 or variable on the same data
(SPFF1 vs SP) has an important impact in the apparent lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬂux, the total ﬂux and the total unsigned
ﬂux. The apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux (Bapp) is over-
estimated by 5% in the penumbra, underestimated by 18%
in the strong plage, and underestimated by 26% in the weak
plage when the magnetic ﬁeld has been obtained considering
a FF ﬁxed to 1 (BS PFF1
), compared with when the FF is vari-
able (BS P
app). The total magnetic ﬂux and the unsigned total
magnetic ﬂux have a similar behavior in those regions.

The error introduced by diﬀerent disambiguation methods
is negligible in the umbra and penumbra. While for the plage,
the scatter introduced by the diﬀerent resolved azimuth is
smaller than the scatter introduced by the other actors. Nev-
ertheless, if we compare only those pixels sharing the same
sign after the disambiguation, the positive impact in all the
variables might be important. For the comparison between
the original HMI and SP data, the improvement in the ex-
plained variation of the horizontal components of the pre-
dicted BHMI with respect considering all the pixels is ∼ 40%
and ∼ [20 − 35]% in the strong and weak plage. If we sim-
ply inverted the SP data with a FF ﬁxed to 1, as HMI does,
the correlation coeﬃcients for between the horizontal com-
ponents in those pixels sharing the same sign in both maps
become <r> ∼ 0.92 and ∼ 83 for the strong and the weak
plage. comparison between HMI and S2HFF1, the explained
variation of the horizontal components of the predicted BHMI
becomes ∼ 85% and 67% in the strong and the weak plage
respectively.

Using diﬀerent disambiguation methods, we have found
that about ∼ 25% and ∼ 35% of the pixels in the plage ob-
served and disambiguated by HMI have an opposite sign with
respect to the ones observed and disambiguated by SP. Similar
values are obtained even when the same data (SP) are disam-
biguated using diﬀerent methods (AMBIG vs AZAM). The
analysis of the disambiguation of the azimuth has proved that
the opposite sign in the horizontal components of those struc-
tures in the plage is due to use diﬀerent disambiguation meth-
ods, and not to opposite values of the pre-disambiguation az-
imuth. We suggest to investigate the option to use the same
disambiguation code to solve the azimuth observed by HMI
and SP data. That would improve the results of a comparison
between them, especially in the plage, but, more important, it
would favor the quasi-simultaneous and complementary use
of both data.

In summary, the correlation between the components of the
magnetic ﬁeld observed by HMI and the ones observed by SP
are very high in the umbra and penumbra, while it is moder-
ate and weak for the strong and weak magnetic ﬁeld of the
plage respectively. Similar behavior happens for the apparent
magnetic ﬁeld and the total ﬂux. The uncertainty in predict-
app , ΦHMI and (cid:98)ΦHMI from the respective values
ing BHMI , BHMI
observed by SP becomes larger as we move from the regions
with strong magnetic ﬁeld and a ﬁlling factor closer to 1, to
the regions where the magnetic ﬁeld is weaker and the ﬁlling
factor either is closer to 0 or more diﬃcult to determine, i.e.
as the observation goes from the umbra to the penumbra, then
from there to strong plage, and ﬁnally from there to the weak
plage. The only exception to this behavior happens in the sta-
tistical values of the comparison between ΦHMI vs ΦS P and
(cid:98)ΦHMI vs (cid:98)ΦS P in the strong plage, which are worse than the
ones corresponding to the weak plage.

Considering inversions with a similar treatment for the ﬁll-

20

ing factor and the disambiguation of the azimuth would im-
prove signiﬁcantly the comparison between the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld observed by HMI and SP. However, to consider a
FF variable for HMI data may be not reliable due to S/N con-
strain (more than for the fact of using 6 spectral points). A
careful study would be necessary to implement or discard this
option. For the apparent longitudinal magnetic ﬂux and the to-
tal ﬂux, the impact of the ﬁlling factor, the spectral sampling
and their combination is very little, being again the ﬁlling fac-
tor the most important actor.

APPENDIX

In this appendix we show information about the data, detailed statistical values for the straightforward comparison between
HMI and SP, and the averaged statistical values for the comparison between HMI and the pseudo-SP data. Despite the
tediousness that all this information may represent for the reader, we consider it valuable for supporting our study and results.

DATA SELECTION
Table 7 shows the observation date (1st column), the starting time and the middle time for the scan in the SP instrument (2nd and
3rd columns), and the closest in time HMI ﬁltergram to the latter one (4th column). The positions of the selected maps are given
in heliocentric coordinates (5th column), and by µ = cos(θ), being θ the heliocentric angle (6th column). The size of the SP maps
is given in (cid:48)(cid:48) × (cid:48)(cid:48) (7th column).

INDIVIDUAL LINEAR REGRESSION FITS AND STATISTICAL VALUES FOR THE COMPARISON HMI VS SP

Tables 8 and 9 show several statistical values about the linear regression ﬁt for the regions of interest analyzed in the individual
maps presented in Table 7. The statistical values <b> , <se> , <r> and <r2> showed in the Table 3 are the mean (averaged)
values calculated from the columns 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th respectively. The errors presented in Table 3 are the standard error of the
mean values of the the quantities showed in Tables 8 and 9.

LINEAR REGRESSION AND STATISTICAL VALUES FOR THE COMPARISON BETWEEN HMI VS SP, HMI VS
PSEUDO-SP MAPS AND SP VS PSEUDO-SP MAP

In this section, we show the averaged statistical values for the linear regression ﬁt between the components of the vector
magnetic ﬁeld observed by HMI and SP (cases A to D, Table 10), and between pseudo-SP and SP (cases E to H, Table 11).
maps. The ﬁrst sub-table corresponds to the case A (HMI vs SP), and it is the same than the Table 3. We keep it here for a better
comparison of its results with those corresponding to the cases B, C and D of Table 2. That means, for the comparison between
HMI and the SP maps inverted with FF=1 (2nd sub-table), SP data sampled as HMI does (3rd sub-table), and SP data sampled as
HMI does and inverted with FF=1 (4th sub-table). The meaning of the variables is the same as in Table 3. See Section 3.2 for
details about the interpretation on the values presented here.

Similarly, Tables 11 and 12 show the averaged statistical values for the comparison between the SP and the pseudo-SP maps.
They correspond to the cases E, F, G, and H described in Table 2. Section 3.3 discusses the physical meaning of the values of
these comparisons.

Table 13 is an extension of the Table 5. Here, in addition to the comparison of the apparent magnetic ﬂux (Bapp, top sub-table)
the total magnetic ﬂux (Φ, middle sub-table), and total unsigned magnetic ﬂux ((cid:98)Φ, bottom sub-table) calculated by HMI and SP,
we show these relationships between HMI and the pseudo-SP maps. A discussion about the values of Table 5 may be found in
Section 3.5. Table 14 is equivalent to Table 13 for the comparisons between SP, SPFF1, S2H and S2HFF1, i.e. for the cases E to
H.

STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF THE DISAMBIGUATION IN THE COMPARISON BETWEEN HMI AND SP

Since our study has been mainly devoted to the comparison of the vector magnetic ﬁeld in Cartesian coordinates, i.e. with the
ambiguity of the azimuth resolved, we have found the need to explore in detail the impact of the procedures used to solve that
problem, which in the solar community is known as disambiguation of the azimuth of the vector magnetic ﬁeld.

In this section, we show diﬀerent solutions found for three codes: the one used by HMI project (denoted in this paper as ‘DIS’);
AZAM is a code available at SolarSoft for Hinode/SP data; and AMBIG, an automatic code ready to be used on Hinode/SP data
and very similar to the one used with HMI data12. The disambiguation of the azimuth is based in several assumptions concerning
to the magnetic ﬁeld, for instance: azimuth which best matches the potential ﬁeld, the minimum Jz, center of azimuths and etc.
This paper is not an exhaustive study of the disambiguation problem. Leka et al. (2009b), Georgoulis (2012), and Leka et al.
(2012) provide an interesting discussion on this topic, and the limitations that diﬀerent methods have. Being that said, the results
presented in the Section, about the impact using diﬀerent solution of the ambiguity of the azimuth when comparing B obtained
from diﬀerent instruments, should be considered constrained to the type of data compared in this study: regular size sunspot,
with a plage homogeneously distributed around the sunspot, in a small ﬁeld of view around the sunspot, and for the speciﬁc
instrumental features of each data set compared. Thus, this investigation represents an example of the important role played by
the disambiguation when one wants to recover the vector magnetic ﬁeld from real observations.

We have used three diﬀerent disambiguation methods to calculate the vector magnetic ﬁeld observed by SP: i) using AZAM
with the option “center” in the sunspot, then we apply the option “smooth” in the whole map, ii) using AZAM with the manual
method option “center” in the sunspot, then we use the manual ”wads” action on the plage and small areas of the sunspot, ﬁnally
the whole map is smoothed, referred as BSP AZAM2 ; and iii) using the automatic disambiguation method AMBIG, developed
by Leka et al. 2009a13, referred as BSP AMBIG . All the results presented in the main body of this paper have been calculated
using the disambiguation method i). In this case, we simply referred to is as BSP when we refer to the Cartesian coordinates. To
distinguish the azimuth for the disambiguated azimuth, we have explicitly denoted them by φS P

We ﬁrst study the eﬀect of the disambiguation on the azimuth (i.e. in spherical coordinates). Then, we give a detailed discussion

B and φS P AZAM

of the eﬀect of the disambiguation on the Cartesian coordinates.

Figure 9 shows the azimuth disambiguated for HMI in the 1st and 6th column in both rows. We have explicitly denoted the

Fig. 9.— Comparison between the azimuth disambiguated on HMI (explicitly denoted as HMI DIS) and SP using AZAM and AMBIG (1st row), and SP using
AZAM2 and S2H using DIS (2nd row), for inversions considering FF variable (SP an S2H) and FF ﬁxed to 1 (SPFF1 and S2HFF1).

disambiguated azimuth observed by HMI as ‘HMI DIS’. In the 2nd and 3rd images of the 1st row, we show the disambiguated
azimuth for SP and SFFF1. The same azimuth values disambiguated with AMBIG are shown in the 4th and 5th images. In the
2nd row, the 2nd and 3rd maps are showing the disambiguated SP and SPFF1 azimuth with AZAM2, and the 4th and 5th images
show S2H and S2HFF1 azimuth disambiguated as HMI does, therefore, they are also denoted with ‘DIS’. At a glance, it is
clear that diﬀerent disambiguation codes may give slightly diﬀerent solutions to the ambiguty of the azimuth (SP AZAM vs SP
AZAM2), or quite diﬀerent solutions (SP AZAM or AZAM2 vs SP AMBIG), even when the codes are working on the same
data (azimuth of SP data). This diﬀerence is most noticeable in the plage. The solution found by the same code (DIS) applied
to similar data (S2H and HMI) gives a close solution between those data set. The statistical values of this visual comparison
are given in Table 15 and 16. The <b> for the relationship between the disambiguated azimuths φHMIDIS
in the
weak and strong plage are as high as ∼ 0.8 and 0.6 respectively, showing a moderately strong correlation (<r> ∼ 0.85 and 0.75
respectively). However, it would be a mistake to considerer a solution to be the ‘right solution’ because of these high values in
the correlation between of the azimuths. Since, what these statistical values tell us is that the solution for the ambiguity in the
azimuth for the data compared is very close, if not the same, in both data set. We conclude that using diﬀerent methods for the
same data set may provide diﬀerent solutions (e.g. AZAM vs AMBIG on SP data), but using similar methods with similar data
set provides similar solutions (SP AZAM vs SP AZAM2 or HMI DIS vs S2H DIS).

Table 17 shows the results for the straightforward comparison between HMI and SP, being SP disambiguated with the methods
mentioned above. Again, for a better comparison we keep the results showed in Table 3 as the 1st sub-table. The 2nd and
3rd sub-tables show the same comparison between the components of the magnetic ﬁeld observed by HMI and the ones observed
by SP when they have been disambiguated with the methods ii) and iii) respectively. The results for the three disambiguation
methods are statistically similar in all the RoIs. That means, to apply these other disambiguation methods to SP data does not
have an impact in the comparison with HMI disambiguated data. Figure 10 shows the same maps that Fig. 4, but here they
are disambiguated with method AZAM2 (top panels) and AMBIG (bottom panels). The maps in Fig. 10 show a more coherent
spatial distribution of the values than for the maps in Fig. 4. However, this fact has not an impact in the statistical values for
the comparison of the components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld, since most of the pixels showing that diﬀerent solution are not
considered in the comparison, not even as part of the weak plage, because their polarization signal is below the criteria used in
this paper (see Section 2.2).

However, as we pointed out in Section 3.1, there are regions where the horizontal components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
observed by HMI show opposite (or mixed) polarity with respect to the ones observed by SP. We have studied in how many
pixels in the comparison between HMI and SP that happens. Since the three disambiguations methods provide statistically
the same results for the umbra and the penumbra (see Table 17), we only oﬀer the results for the strong and weak plage in the
following tables. Tables 18, 19, and 20 are divided as follows. In the top of these tables, there is the comparison between the HMI
and SP/SPFF1 without considering any relationship between the sign of the components, as it has been done in the main body of
the paper (e.g., the sub-table in the top of 18 is the same that 3). In the middle and the bottom of these tables, we have done the
same analysis, i.e., linear regression ﬁt and averaged statistical values for the components of the magnetic ﬁeld observed by two
data set at the pixels showing a positive relationship (middle sub-table) and a negative relationship (bottom sub-table) between
their horizontal components. In addition, in these tables we show the percentage of the pixels evaluated in the comparison. For
the sub-table in the top, the percentages refer to the total size of the map, while for the sub-tables in the middle and the bottom
they refer to the size of the RoI considered. Table 18 refers to the straightforward comparison between BHMI and BSP , i.e., as it
is considered in Section 3.1. We have done a similar analysis for the comparison between HMI and SP data disambiguated with

AZAM method ii) and with AMBIG code. For the three disambiguation methods used in this paper, the percentages of pixels
having the same sign for the horizontal components of the magnetic ﬁeld are very similar in the three tables, either for the strong
plage (73−80%) or the weak plage (61−67%). The number of pixels with opposite sign in the comparison is, although calculated
independently, the complementary to 100% of those values. That happens even when we consider the same data, from the same
instrument (same spatial and spectral sampling, same spectral line) and solved with the same inversion code (IC) as it is showed
in Table 20, where we compare BSP AMBIG with BSP . Because of all the results are similar in the three cases, we conclude that
the diﬀerent disambiguation solutions used in this study - AZAM methods i) and ii) and AMBIG - introduce a change of sign in
the solar structures with respect to the solution found by HMI observed about ∼ 25% in the strong plage, and about ∼ 35% in the
weak plage.

It is obvious that disentangling the mixed sings favor a better linear relationship between the horizontal components. If we

would only consider those pixels where the relationship of the horizontal component is positive – i.e., the solutions of disam-
biguation methods used here match with the one found by HMI–, all the averaged statistical values <se> , <r> , and <r2> will
have a signiﬁcant improvement, both in the strong and the weak plage. Table 19 compares the HMI data with the SP data inverted
considering a FF ﬁxed to 1. The correlation for between the horizontal components in those pixels sharing the same sign in both
maps become <r> ∼ 0.92 and ∼ 83 for the strong and the weak plage.

The values associate to the Y component of the vector magnetic ﬁeld is the one showing the biggest improvement. As we
explained in Section 3.2, there are several solar structures in the BHMI
maps of the plage showing opposite or mixed sign with
respect the SP or pseudo-SP maps (see Figure 4). In summary, if we do not consider those structures the linear relationship
between HMI and SP will become stronger. Applying a reliable disambiguation code able to solve the azimuth ambiguity to
both HMI and SP data, would beneﬁt the comparison between them. Of course, the solution found for such a code will rely on
the azimuth found by the inversions results, but using the same disambiguation code might favor to ﬁnd similar disambiguation
solutions.
