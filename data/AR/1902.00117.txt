Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction: How wrong for uniform densities and
large-Z atoms?

(Dated: April 9, 2019)

Semi-local density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy of a many-electron system
cannot be exact for all one-electron densities. In 1981, Perdew and Zunger (PZ) subtracted the
fully-nonlocal self-interaction error orbital-by-orbital, making the corrected functional exact for all
collections of separated one-electron densities, and making no correction to the exact functional.
Although the PZ self-interaction correction (SIC) eliminates many errors of semi-local function-
als, it is often worse for equilibrium properties of sp-bonded molecules and solids. Non-empirical
semi-local functionals are usually designed to be exact for electron gases of uniform density, and
thus also make 0% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic number Z, but PZ SIC is
not so designed. For localized SIC orbitals, we show analytically that the LSDA-SIC correlation
energy per electron of the uniform gas in the high-density limit makes an error of -50% in the spin-
unpolarized case, and -100% in the fully-spin-polarized case. Then we extrapolate from the Ne, Ar,
Kr, and Xe atoms to estimate the relative errors of the PZ SIC exchange-correlation energies (with
localized SIC orbitals) in the limit of large atomic number: about +5.5% for the local spin density
approximation (LSDA-SIC), and about -3.5% for nonempirical generalized gradient (PBE-SIC) and
meta-generalized gradient (SCAN-SIC) approximations. The SIC errors are considerably larger than
those that have been estimated for LSDA-SIC by approximating the localized SIC orbitals for the
uniform gas, and may explain the errors of PZ SIC for equilibrium properties, opening the door to
a generalized SIC that is more widely accurate.

INTRODUCTION

A realistic description of bonding between atoms in
molecules and solids within Kohn-Sham (KS) ground-
state density functional theory1,2 requires a realistic ap-
proximation to the exact spin-density functional for the
exchange-correlation energy2. Local or semi-local func-
tionals such as the local spin density approximation
(LSDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA),
and the meta-GGA are widely employed. These func-
tionals are single integrals over position space of energy
densities that are functions of ingredients readily avail-
able at each position from self-consistent solution of the
KS or generalized KS one-electron Schr¨odinger equation.
Standard ingredients include the spin-resolved electron
densities (LSDA), and sometimes also their gradients
(GGA) and even orbital kinetic energy densities (meta-
GGA). Semi-local functionals are computationally eﬃ-
cient and often usefully accurate, and lend themselves to
non-empirical construction by satisfaction of many exact
constraints and appropriate norms3. The earliest appro-
priate norms were the uniform electron gases1,4, for which
nearly all practical functionals are exact by construction.
Perhaps the simplest density is that for one isolated
electron (e.g., n↑ = n = |φ|2, n↓ = 0), for which the ex-
act exchange-correlation energy must exactly cancel the
spurious Hartree electrostatic self-interaction. But, since
the Hartree energy

is a fully-nonlocal functional of the density, no local

or semi-local approximation can be exact for all possi-
ble one-electron densities. In 1981, Perdew and Zunger
(PZ)5 proposed to subtract the spurious self-interaction
from each occupied orbital,

where niσ = fiσ |φiσ |2 is the i-th occupied ( fiσ = 1)
orbital density of spin σ, and thus a one-electron den-
sity. Eq.
(2) is exact for any collection of ground- or
excited-state one-electron densities. PZ self-interaction
correction (SIC), applied to the exact functional, makes
no change in it.

PZ also realized that the right orbitals for SIC cannot
be the often-delocalized Kohn-Sham orbitals, but must
be localized to make a properly size-extensive theory in
which the energy of a periodic array of N separated atoms
always becomes N times the energy of one atom in the
limit of large separation. Lin and collaborators6 found
unitary transformations in the occupied-orbital space
that minimize the PZ SIC energy. More recently, Peder-
son et al.7 have found a way to limit this transformation
to Fermi-L¨owdin orbitals (FLOs) that are guaranteed to
be localized, because each has a Fermi orbital descriptor
riσ or position where

|φiσ(riσ)|2 = nσ(riσ) .

(3)

PZ SIC leads to an almost linear (and thus almost exact8)
variation of the energy of an open system with non-

 
 
 
 
 
 
integer average electron number, between adjacent in-
teger electron numbers, and thus often avoids spurious
fractional charges on dissociated atoms9. And it cor-
rects many other qualitative failures of the semi-local
functionals, yielding a correct exchange-correlation po-
tential at the edges of a system, bound negative atomic
ions, raised and improved energy barriers to chemical
reactions10, etc.

For equilibrium properties

like atomization ener-
gies and equilibrium bond lengths, the non-empirical
semi-local functionals have improved in accuracy from
LSDA1,4 to GGA (e.g., Ref. 11) and meta-GGA (e.g.,
Ref. 3). But PZ SIC applied to GGA12,13 and meta-
GGA14 is actually less accurate than GGA or meta-GGA,
respectively, for these properties. Part of the explanation
for this lies in the noded character of overlapped orthog-
onal localized real orbitals. Using complex SIC orbitals
leads to a lower total energy, and reduces but does not
eliminate the errors in the equilibrium properties15. We
have recently argued14 that lobed one-electron densities
(including the familiar stretched one-electron densities
and the less familiar noded ones) are problematic for
semi-local approximation. And some of the troublesome
lobed character survives after the nodes are removed.

Another part of the explanation could be that PZ
SIC loses the exact uniform-density limit that the non-
empirical semi-local functionals all respect. We now
know that, in the limit of large atomic number Z, most of
the electron density in a neutral atom is slowly-varying on
the scale of the local Fermi wavelength16, and that the lo-
cal density approximation, based only upon the uniform
electron gas, becomes relatively exact for the exchange
energy and even for the correlation energy (according
to numerical evidence)17. The exact large-Z asymptotic
expansions for the exchange18,19 and correlation17,20 en-
ergies of neutral atoms are:

Ex = −Ax Z

5

3 + Bx Z + Cx Z

2

3 + · · · ,

Ec = −Ac Z ln(Z) + Bc Z + · · ·

.

(4)

(5)

Clearly the ratio Ec/Ex tends to zero as Z tends to
inﬁnity. LSDA1,4, the PBE GGA11, and the SCAN
(strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed) meta-
GGA3 have similar expansions, and all of those semi-
local approximations are exact to leading order. PBE
and SCAN, but not LSDA, are also accurate for the next-
order terms in Z in Eqs. (4) and (5), as shown in Table I.
(While SCAN was ﬁtted to the exact large-Z limits, the
values of its coeﬃcients for Eqs. (4) and (5) are unpub-
lished.)

Before the relevance of the uniform gas to real sys-
tems was fully understood, it was hard to determine the
errors of PZ SIC for the uniform electron gas, because
there was no reliable construction of the localized SIC
orbitals. Relative errors in the PZ LSDA-SIC negative
exchange energy of about -2.5%21 or about +0.8% or
more22 were estimated. But we can readily construct

the energy-minimizing real Fermi-L¨owdin orbitals for the
atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, then extrapolate the exchange
energy to large Z using the known asymptotic expansions
of Eqs. (4) and (5). The resulting relative errors in the
negative exchange energy turn out to about +5.5% for
PZ LSDA-SIC and about -3.5% for PZ PBE-SIC and PZ
SCAN-SIC, and thus not negligible. Since Ex and Ec
are negative, a positive percentage error means that an
approximation is too negative, and a negative percent-
age error means that the approximation is not negative
enough.

In the high-density limit, exchange completely domi-
nates over correlation. Since the PZ LSDA-SIC exchange
energy per electron of a uniform electron gas is too low
with real SIC orbitals, minimizing the total SIC energy
over complex orbitals can only make it lower and less
accurate. A consequence of our work is that, in a high-
density uniform electron gas, a real unitary transforma-
tion that minimizes the total energy will yield localized
SIC orbitals in PZ LSDA-SIC, but (unless constrained as
in the Fermi-L¨owdin-orbital approach7) delocalized SIC
orbitals in PZ PBE-SIC and PZ SCAN-SIC. Although
delocalized or Kohn-Sham SIC orbitals would make the
PZ PBE-SIC and PZ SCAN-SIC exact for uniform elec-
tron gases, they are ruled out by our requirement that
SIC be size extensive.

While the exact exchange energy of Kohn-Sham theory
requires a multiplicative exchange potential Vx,σ(r), it is
for practical purposes equivalent to the Hartree-Fock ex-
change energy for the same electron spin densities. The
diﬀerence is only about 0.03% for the Ar atom23, and
tends to 0% as Z → ∞. The exact exchange energy and
all reasonable approximations to it (including Eq.
(2)
with xc replaced everywhere by x) are homogeneous func-
tionals that obey a uniform-density-scaling equality24.
Thus, while the large-Z limit for neutral atoms corre-
sponds to high electron densities, the relative (%) error
of a reasonable approximation to the exchange energy
functional is the same for all uniform electron densities.
Since SCAN is self-correlation-free, it requires and gets
no SIC for correlation, but the LSDA and PBE corre-
lation functionals do. The leading term for the corre-
lation energy in the high-density limit, with or without
SIC, can be found exactly by analytic derivation, and will
thus be presented before and used in the extrapolation
for the exchange-correlation energy. The PZ SIC rela-
tive errors for the correlation energy in the high-density

limit are -50% to -100%, for the spin-unpolarized and
fully-polarized cases respectively. The special property
of the logarithm, ln(AB) = ln(A) + ln(B), makes it possi-
ble to ﬁnd these relative errors without constructing the
localized SIC orbitals for the uniform electron gas.

Understanding the errors that PZ SIC makes for uni-
form densities and for large-Z atoms is a necessary ﬁrst
step toward the development of a generalized SIC26 that
would be more widely accurate than PZ SIC. Such a cor-
rection might modify the semi-local part of the PZ SIC
of Eq.
(2) in regions where the localized SIC orbitals
overlap, as in Ref. 13 but without modifying the fully
non-local part.

Our calculations

for atoms are made with the
FLOSIC27 molecular code, which in turn is based upon
and uses the default all-electron Gaussian basis set of the
NRLMOL code28. The basis sets allow us to treat Ne, Ar,
Kr, and Xe, but not Rn (which has f electrons). The in-
tegration mesh for SCAN is about three times bigger than
the default mesh. The integration mesh in the FLOSIC
code is variational29 and for all calculations the maximal
error margin for the integration mesh is set to 10−7. The
descriptors or positions of the FLOs are optimized using
LSDA-SIC until the maximum component of the forces30
are lower than 10−3 Hartree/Bohr. The LSDA-SIC opti-
mized descriptors are used to self-consistently minimize
the FLOs and the corresponding PZ SIC total energy31
with a threshold of 10−6 Hartree for all PZ SIC function-
als employed here. The exchange and correlation ener-
gies obtained from these calculations are given in Tables
II and III.

II. CORRELATION ENERGY AT HIGH
DENSITY: ANALYTIC DERIVATION

The exact correlation energy per electron for a uni-
form electron gas in the high-density limit is given by
the random phase approximation32,33:

eexact
c

(n, ζ) = −αc(ζ) ln(n)

(6)

where n = n↑ +n↓ is the total density and ζ = (n↑ −n↓)/n is
the relative spin polarization (0 for the unpolarized case,
and ±1 for the fully spin-polarized case). Note that33
αc(1) = 1
2 αc(0). We are interested in the unpolarized
case, but will need the fully-polarized case to make the
SIC.

In PZ SIC the localized SIC orbital density is

niσ(r) = n giσ(n1/3r) .

(7)

(7) has the proper uniform-density scaling24, can
Eq.
integrate to 1 for all n, and can satisfy Eq. (3) for all
n. The shape of this orbital density is unknown, but will
not contribute to the correlation energy per electron of
order ln(n). Thus the relative error in the high-density
limit will be the same whether the SIC orbitals are real
or complex. For LSDA, which are exact for all uniform
densities, the PZ SIC correlation energy per electron of
the spin-unpolarized uniform electron gas in the high-
density limit is

for a -50% error. Following similar reasoning, the PZ

(11)

for a -50% error.

For the PBE-SIC correlation energy, however, the rel-
ative error in the large-Z limit is 0%. This follows from
Eq. (9) of Ref. 11, and from the fact that the reduced
density gradient s for the SIC orbital density does not
approach 0 in the large-Z limit. As a result, the self-
interaction correction to the PBE correlation energy per
electron scales as Z 0, and not as ln(Z), when Z → ∞.

Using the self-consistent density for each functional
and nearly-exact correlation energies17 for the rare-gas
atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, we have computed the rela-
tive errors of the various correlation energy functionals
in Fig. 1. We have then ﬁtted them to the formula

where x = 1/ln(Z). This formula was constructed by
keeping just the ﬁrst two terms in the expansion of Eq.
(5), for both the exact and the approximate functionals,
with the coeﬃcients of the leading terms as derived in
this section, making ∆ = 0% for LSDA, PBE, SCAN, and
PBE-SIC, but ∆ = −50% for LSDA-SIC. SCAN, which is
already self-correlation-free, needs no SIC for correlation.
From this, we constructed the large-Z expansion of Eq.
(12) for the relative error of each approximate functional.
Enough terms in that expansion were kept to provide
three parameters a, b, and c to be least-squares ﬁtted
to the four considered atoms. (Four parameters would
overﬁt the data.)

It is a long extrapolation from Z = 54 (Xe) to Z = ∞.
The data of Fig. 1 for each functional preﬁgure but do
not pinpoint that functional’s analytic large-Z limit.

The points shown are for (from left to right) Xe (Z = 54), Kr
(Z = 36), Ar (Z = 18), and Ne (Z = 10). The smooth curves
are based upon least-squares ﬁts of the parameters a, b, and
c in the asymptotic formula of Eq. (12). The 1/ln(Z) → 0
limit gives the relative error of the correlation energy for the
high-density spin-unpolarized uniform electron gas: ∆ = 0 for
LSDA, PBE, SCAN, and PBE-SIC, and ∆ = −50% for LSDA-
SIC, constrained to values derived in the text.

Using the self-consistent density for each functional
and Hartree-Fock exchange energies25 for the rare-gas
atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, we have plotted the relative
errors of the various approximate exchange functionals
in Fig. 2. We have then ﬁtted them to the formula

Eq. (13), keeping just enough terms to provide three pa-
rameters a, b, and c to be least-squares ﬁtted to the four
considered atoms.

Although we know that the parameter a should be 0%
for LSDA, PBE, and SCAN, we have not constrained a to
this exact value. Values of |a| less than 0.5% emerge for
all three approximations (Appendix B), suggesting that
the considerably larger +5.8% for LSDA-SIC, -3.3% for
PBE-SIC, and -3.6% for SCAN-SIC can be trusted within
±0.5%. These large-Z limits are clearly pre-ﬁgured in the
data for Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe.

The exchange-correlation energy is just the sum of the
exchange and correlation energies, and is presented for
completeness in Fig. 3. The ﬁtting formula is

I. ∆ is 0% for LSDA, PBE, SCAN, PBE-SIC, and SCAN-
SIC, but -50% for LSDA-SIC. Eq. (14) was constructed
(Appendix A) almost as Eq. (13) was, but includes the
exact Z ln(Z) terms derived in section II. The Z → ∞
or x → 0 limit is dominated by exchange, and yields
conclusions similar to those of Fig. 2: LSDA-SIC makes
a +5.3% error in this limit, while PBE-SIC and SCAN-
SIC respectively make -3.6% and -3.9% errors.

IV. CONCLUSION

The Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (PZ
SIC) to a semi-local density-functional approximation for
the exchange-correlation energy imposes some additional
exact constraints, such as exactness for all collections of
separated one-electron densities and (nearly) linear varia-
tion of the total energy between adjacent integer electron
numbers. But it loses other exact constraints or appropri-
ate norms, such as exactness for all uniform densities and
0% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic
number. This could explain PZ SIC’s curious perfor-
mance history of striking successes and equally striking
failures, which are in a way the complements to those of
the semi-local approximations.

The diﬃculty in constructing energy-minimizing but
localized SIC orbitals for the uniform electron gas has
led until recently to large uncertainties in the relative
errors of PZ SIC for this important appropriate norm.
We have found analytically that PZ LSDA-SIC correla-
tion makes an error of -50% for spin-unpolarized uniform
densities in the high-density limit or for large-Z atoms,
and -100% for fully-spin-polarized uniform densities in
the high-density limit, independent of the details of the
localized SIC orbitals. By extrapolating the relative error
of the exchange energy from Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, guided
by the known asymptotics of the large-Z limit, and em-
ploying real localized orbitals, we have estimated that

electron gas.

ergy is about 5.5% too negative, while the PBE-SIC and
SCAN-SIC exchange energies are not negative enough by
about 3.5%. The estimated uncertainties due to extrap-
olation, based upon our results for the semi-local func-
tionals without SIC, are less than ±0.5%.

The complementary strengths and weaknesses of PZ
SIC and a semi-local functional like SCAN3 to which it is
applied suggest that a widely-useful approximation might
be found from a generalized self-interaction correction to
SCAN (actually just to SCAN exchange, since SCAN is
self-correlation-free) which preserves the best features of
both, being accurate for real atoms, large-Z atoms, and
uniform densities. This possibility is being explored26.

We have seen that a knowledge of the asymptotic forms
(4) and (5), and data from the sequence of real atoms
Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, are suﬃcient to determine the large-
Z limits for the LSDA, PBE, and SCAN exchange en-
ergy functionals within ±0.5%. There is of course no
guarantee that the SIC exchange functionals approach
their large-Z limits as rapidly as these semi-local func-
tionals do. But we know that real atoms are also appro-
priate norms2,20 for functionals beyond LSDA. Just cor-
recting the large relative errors of SIC exchange for the
real atoms Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe (Fig. 2) might improve
the performance of SIC for the equilibrium properties of
molecules and solids.

Appendix A: Derivation of the ﬁtting formulas, Eqs.
(14) and (13)

We deﬁne the exact and the approximate exchange-
correlation energy by considering the sum of the ﬁrst
three terms of the exact large-Z asymptotic expansions
for the exchange energy (Eq. (4)) and the ﬁrst two terms
of the exact large-Z asymptotic expansions for the corre-
lation energy (Eq. (5)).

The above Eq. (A6) is the same as Eq. (14). When
exchange-only terms are considered, the second term van-
ishes and the equation reduces to Eq. (13).

The

parameters

from least-
square ﬁts to the asymptotic Eq.
(14) are: LSDA
(−0.64, −61.36, 74.87); PBE (−0.48, −0.54, −4.28); SCAN
LSDA-SIC (5.34, 5.05, −8.66);

PBE-SIC (−3.64, 29.83, −43.81);
SCAN-SIC (−3.91,

We have also examined the eﬀect of the choice of elec-
tron density on the ﬁtted parameter a which indicates
the relative (%) error in DFT exchange energy in the
large-Z limit (using Eq. (13)). The parameter a com-
puted at self consistent density (nsc f ) for LSDA, PBE,
and SCAN functionals are −0.18, −0.06, and −0.28, re-
spectively. In comparison, the parameter a computed at
the exact Hartree-Fock density34 for LSDA, PBE, and
SCAN functionals are 0.09, 0.13, and −0.06, respectively.
The inﬂuence of the electron density is negligible in de-
termining the parameter a in Eq. (13).
