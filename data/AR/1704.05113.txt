Abstract 

Wind shear measured by Doppler tracking of the Huygens probe is evaluated, and found to be within 

the range anticipated by pre-flight assessments (namely less than two times the Brunt-Vaisala 

frequency).  The strongest large-scale shear encountered was ~5 m/s/km, a level associated with 'Light' 

turbulence in terrestrial aviation.    Near-surface winds  (below 4km) have small-scale fluctuations of 

~0.2 m/s , indicated both by probe tilt and Doppler tracking, and the characteristics of the fluctuation, of 

interest for future missions to Titan, can be reproduced with a simple autoregressive (AR(1)) model. The 

turbulent dissipation rate at an altitude of ~500m is found to be 16 cm2/sec3, which may be a useful 

benchmark for atmospheric circulation models. 

 
1. Introduction 

Wind shear, the spatial gradient of wind speed, is of significant practical interest in planetary exploration 

and in terrestrial aviation. A vehicle moving relative to the air will encounter time-varying winds which 

can excite movements which may blur images (Karkoschka, 2016), affect the strength of the radio signal 

(Dzierma et al., 2007), or cause air passengers to spill their drinks.  These movements, which depend on 

the characteristics of the vehicle as well as the wind shear, are typically referred to as 'turbulence'.  

Turbulence more generally, however, is the spatio-temporal variation of the wind, and can also manifest 

itself as fluctuations in a time series of wind measured at a fixed point as the turbulent wind field is 

advected past a meteorological station.  These fluctuations are of interest in that they are intimately 

associated with the transport of matter, energy and momentum at the macroscale through an 

atmosphere via so-called eddy diffusivity. Turbulent fluctuations are often also the critical factor in 

exceeding a transport threshold where mean winds are not enough (e.g. the saltation speed for sand 

grains – Burr et al., 2015; Lorenz et al., 2014;  Tokano et al, 2010).  The fluctuations also represent the 

process by which mechanical energy is ultimately dissipated by the turbulent cascade into viscous 

dissipation. 

Here I explore what the Huygens descent measurements indicate about these topics, most particularly 

through the wind measurements made by the Doppler Wind Experiment (Bird et al., 2005; Folkner et al., 

2006).  First, however, it is pertinent to recall what kind of wind shear environment was anticipated. 

2. Pre-Cassini Expectations of Wind Shear 

Because the gust environment could excite motions of the Huygens probe under its parachute, thereby 

causing an interruption of its radio link to Cassini by mispointing its antennas, an evaluation of wind 

shear was made during the Huygens probe development  (Strobel and Sicardy, 1997).   Having to devise 

a specification on some aspect of an planetary environment for a vehicle intended to make the very first 

in-situ measurements of that environment is one of the great ironical challenges of planetary 

exploration. The evaluation by Strobel and Sicardy (1997) identified physical constraints on wind shear 

(specifically, the vertical gradient of horizontal winds), suggesting that a strong upper limit on shear 

determined by the critical Richardson number was 2N, where N is the Brunt-Vaisala (buoyancy) 

 
 
frequency, determined by the vertical stability of the atmosphere.  Although not intuitively obvious, it is 

seen that the buoyancy frequency units of inverse seconds are the same as those of wind shear, namely 

meters per second per meter.   The buoyancy frequency profile was estimated from the temperature 

structure derived for Titan's low-latitude atmosphere from the Voyager 1 radio occultation experiment.  

The peak shear (2N) anticipated was 16 m/s/km at an altitude of 60km.  As this paper shows later, this 

estimate, devised from very limited information, proved to be a generally appropriate one. 

In flowing down this expectation of the maximum possible shear to a parachute engineering 

specification (table 1, from Aerospatiale, 1997), the profile was de-rated somewhat by 'engineering 

judgement'.   This was presumably because it was hard to meet underlying requirement that "the probe 

shall limit the pendular motion during the descent to an amplitude of 10o" in that in steady state 

descent at speed W,  if the wind shear is γ, then the probe-parachute system will trim at an angle Θ 

given by tan(Θ) = Wγ/g .   Since the terminal velocity W at 60km is 25 m/s,  adopting the upper limit of 

2N would give a trim of 16 o  - thus even with a parachute system that was perfectly damped, the 

allowed limit would be violated.     The specification was therefore rationalized by cutting off the peak 

and reducing the profile overall. The specification was considered a '95%' limit  (without documented 

statistical justification, but with the intent that occasional violations could be tolerated).

3.  Wind Profile in the Free Atmosphere 

The principal source of wind information on Titan is from the Doppler tracking of the Huygens probe 

(Bird et al., 2005; Folkner et al. 2006).  The range-rate (i.e. velocity along the line-of-sight to the Earth) 

was measured using a precision frequency reference on the radio link. With knowledge of the viewing 

geometry and an estimate of the vertical descent speed of the probe (which had a significant projection 

on the line-of-sight) and with the assumption that meridional winds were zero, this range rate could be 

rescaled into a zonal (E-W) probe velocity, generally close to the ambient zonal wind velocity.  The 

resultant dataset (HP-SSA-DWE-2-3-DESCENT-V1.0) is archived on the Atmospheres Node of the 

Planetary Data System. 

In fact, the meridional velocity is not quite zero, and some initial estimates were made by computing the 

probe location relative to features seen on the ground by the Descent Imager and Spectral Radiometer 

(DISR) on Huygens during the latter part of descent (Tomasko et al., 2005). Recently, an improved 

evaluation of meridional winds has been made using the entire descent image dataset (Karkoschka, 

2016).  While these data are useful to define the overall wind profile (and indicate a shear of 1 m/s/km 

in the lowest 2km of the atmosphere and very little shear above), they are too sparse to meaningfully 

evaluate fluctuations. The meridional wind speed is small enough that the assumption of zero i 

reduction of the range rate measurement to a zonal wind speed is essentially unaffected. 

The zonal wind profile is plotted on figure 1, and several broadly linear regions are identified, with large-

scale (several km in vertical extent) shears of up to 5 m/s/km.   This observed shear profile is plotted as 

grey bars in figure 2, which also shows the (doubled) buoyancy frequency from Strobel and Sicardy 

(1997) and the adopted specification from table 1.   It is seen that the specification was not violated, 

although there was essentially zero margin in the 110-120km altitude range.  The original 

recommendation of a robust upper limit of 2N would have had approximately 50% margin. 

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The Huygens Doppler Wind profile (dots).   Approximately linear regions of wind 

shear are noted, with the gradient (in m/s/km) noted. 

 
Figure 2.   The upper limit on expected wind shear defined in Strobel and Sicardy (1997, 

solid curve) as twice the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, compared with the adopted 95% 

Huygens wind shear specification (blue dashed curve, table 1) and the observed shear 

from the linear segments identified in figure 1 (grey bars). It is seen that in general the 

wind shear did not quite exceed the specification. It is of interest that one region of 

strongest observed shear (60-80km) was where the shear was anticipated to be 

strongest. 

To put these shears in context, although turbulence in passenger aviation is usually defined in terms of 

vehicle motion  (and a small, slow-flying aircraft will typically respond more violently to a given wind 

shear than a heavy, fast-flying one), Houboldt's review paper on the topic (Houboldt, 1973) suggests 

that 'Light' turbulence is typically associated with a shear of 2.5-10 m/s/km.  Thus some parts of the 

 
 
 
Huygens descent met this classification, but moderate or severe (>17.5 m/s/km) shear levels were not 

encountered.   

4.  Near-Surface Atmosphere Profile 

The atmosphere near the ground is considered separately from the free atmosphere : the stability of the 

Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) makes its behaviour quite distinct.  The PBL is indicated in the potential 

temperature profile  (temperature with an adiabatic correction for altitude ) which shows a constant 

region up to 300m altitude (figure 3).  Although initially interpreted as defining 'the planetary boundary 

layer' (Tokano et al., 2006)  this seems in fact merely to be the top of the growing diurnal boundary layer 

– the Huygens descent was at a local solar time of about 9am. 

Lorenz et al. (2010) noted that breaks in slope higher in the profile may in fact indicate the full depth of 

the layer relevant for near-surface atmospheric dynamics, and in particular breaks at 2 & 3.5km (C and 

D) in figure may be responsible for controlling the remarkably regular spacing of Titan's dunes.   Dunes 

form small and, given enough time in a regular wind pattern and enough sediment supply, progressively 

grow.  Thus an instantaneous view may simply represent the history of the dune field since climate 

cycles established a wind regime, but ultimately dune growth is capped by the boundary layer  which 

seems to control the size and spacing of the largest dunes on Earth.    More recently Charnay and 

Lebonnois (2012) have simulated boundary layer growth in a global circulation model and find that the 

diurnal boundary layer may reach about 1km in thickness (possibly inflection B in figure) whereas a 

seasonal layer grows to a couple of times thicker than that.   These structures have not previously been 

related to the Doppler wind profile.  

 
Figure 3. The potential temperature profile (Tokano et al., 2006; Lorenz et al., 2010) shows 

several features.  A is interpreted as the top of the growing morning boundary layer at 300m ; 

GCM simulations attribute B to the vestige of the previous day's fully-developed diurnal 

boundary layer (Charnay and Lebonnois, 2012) ; C or D may be a seasonal boundary layer 

(Charnay and Lebonnois, 2012) : D appears to control the size and spacing of Titan's dunes. 

Inspection of the Doppler wind profile  (figure 4) indicates two changes in shear sign at about 0.3 and 3 

km, which appear coincident with the A and D discontinuities in the potential temperature profile.  

There does not appear to be a major feature at 1km, although this may not be especially significant 

since the wind speed was approximately zero at this altitude.  The km-scale shears are generally smaller 

than in the free atmosphere :  1 and 2.5 m/s/km.   There is as one might expect a shear near the surface 

due to surface friction, possibly as large as 10 m/s/km. However, the wind speed in the lowest km was in 

any case only 1m/s or less and the measurement uncertainty (also included in the PDS dataset) becomes 

significant – discarding a single data point would bring the upper limit of shear down to only 5 m/s/km.  

There are point-to-point variations throughout the profile that often exceed the error bars, indicating 

some level of small-scale turbulence. 

 
 
Figure 4. Doppler measurements (with estimated error bars) in the lowest 5km of Titan's 

atmosphere.   Gaps occur due to the need to nod the radio telescope periodically to celestial 

reference sources.  The wind is rather small (<2 m/s) and reverses direction a couple of times, 

but with gradients <2 m/s/km, except possibly just at the surface. Here (indicated by only one 

or two data points) the gradient may be 10 m/s/km. The two changes in shear sign are 

interestingly coincident with the main breaks in potential temperature structure A  and D. 

5.  Turbulence Measurements and Dissipation Rate 

Examining these small-scale fluctuations, we can interpret the Doppler Wind profile near the surface in 

an alternative way.  It is instructive to ignore the vertical descent of the vehicle, and merely interpret the 

measurements as a wind time series. Taking differences between successive measurements (which for 

the lowest part of descent, where the Doppler measurements were made at the Parkes radio telescope 

in Australia, correspond to 3-second integrations) correspond to yields an approximately Gaussian 

 
 
 
distribution (figure 5).  Of 76 differences, 6 are above 0.4 m/s, and one is above 0.6 m/s,  broadly 

consistent given the poor statistics with these being considered '2-sigma' (95%) and '3-sigma' values.   

Figure 5.  Differences between successive Doppler wind measurements (3 seconds apart, histogram) are 

approximately Gaussian (red line)  with a standard deviation of 0.21 m/s. 

There is independent information suggesting a characteristic fluctuation of this order in the lower 

atmosphere. Tilt sensors on the probe (Lorenz et al., 2007) were sampled at 1-second intervals, and 

while the data were influenced by short-period dynamical effects in the earlier, faster part of descent, 

near the surface where the descent speed was only ~5 m/s, tilts and angular rates were low (Lorenz, 

2009).  Examining the data (archive product SSP_TIL_123456_0_R_ATMOS.TAB) shows the tilts to be 

Gaussian in the lowest 4km with a standard deviation of 2.5 degrees (supported by Karkoschka's (2016) 

analysis of DISR images indicating tilts of ~2o in the lowest part of descent.)  Lorenz (2007) showed that 

for small tilts α, the turbulent wind fluctuations  σu can be estimated as σu ~αW/2, and thus for a 

descent speed W=5 m/s and a~0.04 radians, σu ~0.1 m/s. 

 
 
Figure 6.   Huygens tilt sensor readings in the lowest 4 km are Gaussian with standard deviation of 2.5o, 

which can be interpreted as a wind fluctuation of ~0.1 m/s (see text) 

 It is of reassuring interest that the characteristic fluctuation is comparable with the convective velocity 

scale (Deardorff 1970) which can be written w

 = [(g/T )z(F/ρcp)]0.33, where g is acceleration due to 

gravity, T is the absolute temperature, z is the height of the convecting layer, F is the sensible heat flux 

∗

and cp is the specific heat. The terms in parentheses represent a buoyancy parameter and the kinematic 

heat flux respectively.  Adopting, conservatively, z=3km, and F=0.7 W/m2  (e.g. Williams et al., 2012) we 

find w*=0.15 m/s. 

  
 
 
 
The formulation above is derived from wind measurements at a few km altitude, where the actual wind 

speed was around 1 m/s  thus the simple 'turbulence intensity' metric  σ/u  in this instance is  10-20%. 

This may be compared with the models for low altitude turbulence in terrestrial aviation. For example, 

aircraft handling standard MIL-STD-1797  defines the value σw/w (vertical wind) at an altitude of 20 ft 

(~7m)) to be 0.1, and indicates horizontal wind turbulence to be double this value.  A more extensive  

compilation is given by Lappe (1966) who gives expressions of the form  σw = A+Bu for a range of 

different terrains and stability conditions derived from low-altitude B-66 flights, with A=0 to 3 m/s and 

B=0.0 to 0.2.     

A handful of turbulence measurements have been reported on other planetary bodies. On Mars, 

Holstein-Rathlou et al. (2010) reported turbulence levels σu/u at the Phoenix lander to be ~0.1 at 9 and 

17 hrs local solar time, rising to ~0.35 in the middle of the day.  Golitsyn (1978) reports the mean and 

root-mean-square fluctuations in anemometer readings to be  0.4 and 0.1 m/s for Venera-9  and 0.9 and 

0.15 m/s for Venera-10 : these correspond to σu/u of 0.25 and 0.17 respectively.   Thus the Huygens 

measurements seem broadly typical. 

Golitsyn (1978) derived a turbulent dissipation rate (at 1.3m altitude) of 1.3 and 4.3 cm2/sec3 for these 

two sites on Venus. Kerzhanovich et al. (1980) performed Doppler tracking of Venera 11 and 12, and 

derived dissipation rates in the lower Venusian atmosphere of 3-9 cm2/sec3.  If we adopt a length scale L 

of ~500m for the lowest-altitude set of Doppler measurements on Huygens, and   σu ~ 0.2m/s, then the 
turbulent dissipation rate  ε=(σ3

u/L) is ~16 cm2/sec3.  For comparison, on Earth with a wind speed of 5 

m/s, Priestley (1959) suggests ε=102-104  cm2/sec3 at 1m height (see also Taylor, 1952), and 1-10  for 

500m.   Thus in broad terms, Titan appears to have more near-surface dissipation at a given height than 

Venus, but less than Earth, although all three worlds are broadly comparable.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Simulated Turbulent Wind  

Although the variations in wind speed have been described above in terms of a standard deviation, it 

should not be assumed that wind can be modeled (e.g. to simulate the dynamics of exploration vehicles 

at Titan, or to generate synthetic measurement datasets) by a purely random series. There is some 

persistence in the signal, which can be succinctly captured in a simple order-one autoregressive model 

AR(1).   Specifically, the discrete time series  U(t) with t=1,2,3 seconds,..  is generated as  

U(t)=pU(t-1)+N(0,s) 

(1) 

where p is the autoregression coefficient, and N(0,σ) is a Gaussian-distributed random variable with 

zero mean and standard deviation σ.   In the case of p=0, the signal is uncorrelated white noise, while 

p=1 defines the Weiner process, resulting in classical Brownian motion.  Inspection of the Huygens 

Doppler data using the  "arima" function in the statistical analysis package "R" suggests here q=0.96, 

implying a near-Brownian characteristic.  

Turbulence models used in terrestrial aeronautics (e.g. Houboldt, 1973) are essentially similar in form, in 

that time series with the relevant statistical properties can be generated by the linear filtering of a white 

noise signal. Fichtl (1978) provides discrete equations identical in form to eq.1 in his turbulence model 

for the Space Shuttle orbiter. 

A synthetic time series of turbulent fluctuations is generated according to the model above, with σ 

=0.06 m/s   (corresponding to 1-second increments, since the deviation of 0.2 m/s earlier corresponded 

to 3-second integrations), is transformed into an altitude profile roughly as h(t)=0.0047t  (the terminal 

descent of Huygens actually declined from 4.9 m/s at 4km to 4.5 m/s at the surface) and  is superposed 

on a linear gradient, U(h)=0.75-0.85h  to yield the profile in figure 7.    It is seen that the variations are 

rather plausibly described by this simple model.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  The Huygens Doppler measurements in the lowest 3km of the atmosphere (points) compared 

with a linear altitude trend with a superposed AR(1) time series of simulated turbulent fluctuations as 

described in the text.  The model variations appear consistent with those observed.  

7.  Conclusions 

Huygens flight data have been reviewed to assess wind shear and turbulence.  Shear was within pre-

flight limits (although only just), and reached levels typical for 'light turbulence' in aviation.  Near-

surface changes in wind shear at ~300m and 3km appear to coincide with kinks in the potential 

temperature profile associated with planetary boundary layer features. Turbulent fluctuations in the 

lowest few km of the atmosphere of the order of  0.1-0.2 m/s over timescales of 1-3 s are observed, and 

a simple AR(1) model can simulate the observed turbulent structure.  These observations may be useful 

in future Titan exploration.
