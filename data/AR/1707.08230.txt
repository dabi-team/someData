ABSTRACT

We present infrared (IR) and submillimeter observations of the Crab-like super-
nova remnant (SNR) G54.1+0.3 including 350µm (SHARC-II), 870µm (LABOCA),
70, 100, 160, 250, 350, 500µm (Herschel ) and 3-40µm (Spitzer ). We detect dust fea-
tures at 9, 11 and 21µm and a long wavelength continuum dust component. The 21µm
dust coincides with [Ar II] ejecta emission, and the feature is remarkably similar to
that in Cas A. The IRAC 8µm image including Ar ejecta is distributed in a shell-like
morphology which is coincident with dust features, suggesting that dust has formed in
the ejecta. We create a cold dust map that shows excess emission in the northwestern
shell. We ﬁt the spectral energy distribution of the SNR using the continuous distribu-
tions of ellipsoidal (CDE) grain model of pre-solar grain SiO2 that reproduces the 21
and 9µm dust features and discuss grains of SiC and PAH that may be responsible for
the 10-13µm dust features. To reproduce the long-wavelength continuum, we explore
models consisting of diﬀerent grains including Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, Al2O3, FeS, carbon,
and Fe3O4. We tested a model with a temperature-dependent silicate absorption coef-
ﬁcient. We detect cold dust (27-44 K) in the remnant, making this the fourth such SNR
with freshly-formed dust. The total dust mass in the SNR ranges from 0.08 − 0.9 M(cid:12)
depending on the grain composition, which is comparable to predicted masses from
theoretical models. Our estimated dust masses are consistent with the idea that SNe
are a signiﬁcant source of dust in the early Universe.

1 INTRODUCTION

Supernova shocks are known to destroy dust grains in the
diﬀuse interstellar medium (ISM) and theoretical models of
shock-grain interactions suggests this process is highly eﬃ-
cient, with only a few percent of the dust mass surviving
such an interaction (McKee et al. 1987; Jones et al. 1994;
Bianchi & Schneider 2007; Bocchio et al. 2016). However, it
is diﬃcult for the ‘textbook’ dust-forming scenario, believed

to be during the stellar wind phase of AGB stars, to ex-
plain the formation of large amounts of dust observed in the
early Universe (Morgan & Edmunds 2003; Maiolino et al.
2004; Dwek et al. 2007; Micha(cid:32)lowski et al. 2010; Watson
et al. 2015; Micha(cid:32)lowski 2015; Mattsson 2015), unless high
star formation rates and highly eﬃcient theoretical models
of dust yields from AGB stars are invoked (e.g. Valiante
et al. 2009 and Ventura et al. 2012). Massive star SN events
e.g. Type II, Ib and Ic, could solve this problem since they
evolve on much shorter timescales and eject a large amount
of heavy elements into the ISM. If a typical Type II super-
nova were able to condense only 10% of its heavy elements

into dust grains, it could eject around half a solar mass of
dust into the ISM (Nozawa et al. 2003; Todini & Ferrara
2001). For a star formation rate 100 times that of the Milky
Way this would lead to a dust mass of order 108M(cid:12) at z=
6.3-7.5, for 680-850 million years after the Big Bang, if SN
are not eﬃcient dust destroyers (Micha(cid:32)lowski 2015).

A number of comprehensive studies of nearby SNe have
been undertaken in order to estimate the mass of newly
formed dust in the ejecta of core-collapse SNe (see the
review in Gomez 2013). Typical values derived for very
young SNe (within ∼ few years after the explosion) are only
10−4 − 10−2 M(cid:12) of ejecta dust per SN event (see for exam-
ple Sugerman et al. 2006; Kotak et al. 2009; Meikle et al.
2011; Andrews et al. 2011; Gall et al. 2014; Gomez 2014). In
contrast, the case for signiﬁcant amounts of dust formed
in SN ejecta was strengthened by mid-IR (Spitzer ), FIR
(Herschel, AKARI and BLAST) and submillimeter (submm;
SCUBA) observations of much older supernova remnants
(SNRs, > 300 years) including Cas A, the Crab Nebula, and
SNR 1E0102.2-7219. Using the Spitzer mid-IR data alone,
a warm dust mass of 0.02 − 0.054 M(cid:12) was observed in Cas A
(Rho et al. 2008), 3×10−3 - 0.014 M(cid:12) in SNR 1E0102.2-7219
(Sandstrom et al. 2008; Rho et al. 2009c), and 0.012 M(cid:12) in
the Crab Nebula (Temim et al. 2012).

Adding the longer wavelength FIR-submm observations
for the Cas A remnant revealed a cooler component of dust
at ∼ 35 K with mass 0.06 − 0.5 M(cid:12) (Barlow et al. 2010;
Sibthorpe et al. 2010; De Looze et al. 2017). Dunne et al.
(2003) also found a cold dust component radiating at ∼20 K.
Although the emission from these grains are diﬃcult to dis-
entangle from foreground and background dust structures
in the Milky Way (Krause et al. 2004), Dunne et al. (2009)
showed that a signiﬁcant mass of the cold dust seen towards
Cas A was highly polarized and aligned with the SNR mag-
netic ﬁeld, providing evidence that the grains are within the
remnant. Similarly in the Crab Nebula, Gomez et al. (2012a)
found evidence of a more massive, cool component of dust
with Herschel with temperature ∼ 35 K. The ejecta dust
was distributed in the dense ﬁlaments of the plerion where
molecules are also thought to exist (Loh et al. 2011). The
Crab Nebula dust mass ranges from 0.1 − 0.6 M(cid:12) depending
on the assumed grain composition and clumping factor of
the ejecta (see also Owen & Barlow 2015). Sitting between
the old and young SN regimes, FIR-submm observations of
SN1987A with Herschel, and subsequently ALMA, revealed
the unambiguous detection of freshly-formed ejecta dust,
ﬁnding 0.4−0.8 M(cid:12) of cold dust grains (17−23 K) (Matsuura
et al. 2011; Indebetouw et al. 2014; Matsuura et al. 2015;
McCray & Fransson 2016). The dust masses derived from
FIR-submm observations for these three SNRs are therefore
one to two orders of magnitude higher than that measured in
young SNe or based on NIR-mid-IR observations only. This
could be due to the longer wavelength observations needed
to detect emission from the colder, more massive population
of dust, or as proposed in Gall et al. (2014) (see also Wesson
et al. 2015), simply a time evolution issue: the very young
SNe are yet to build up their dust mass to the level seen
in the SNRs. There is therefore growing evidence based on
individual case studies that SNe are important contributors
to the dust budget in galaxies and could be responsible for
the high dust masses seen in the early Universe. However,

evidence for cold dust emission in SN ejecta is still based on
only three known sources.

Further evidence for SN dust formation comes from ob-
servations of pre-solar grains: dust created in the winds of
evolved stars, supernovae (Clayton & Nittler 2004) and in
the interstellar medium before our Solar System was formed.
These grains are recognized by their highly unusual isotopic
compositions relative to all other materials, with the most
abundant examples being Silicon carbide (SiC), nanodia-
monds, amorphous silicates, forsterite, enstatite, and corun-
dum. Somes isotopic anomalies of heavy elements found in
meteorites (Messenger et al. 2006; Nguyen et al. 2016) have
been attributed to dust grains expelled by SNe, these include
the presolar grains: diamond, SiC,
low-density graphite,
Si3N4 and Al2O3 (Clayton & Nittler 2004).

In this paper we use photometric and spectroscopic ob-
servations of the young SNR G54.1+0.3 at IR-submm wave-
lengths to investigate whether dust is present in the SNR
and to determine its composition. G54.1+0.3 is identiﬁed as
a SNR from radio non-thermal emission (Green 1985) with
strong linear polarization detected (Reich et al. 1985). The
SNR is classiﬁed as a Crab-like source with a ﬂat radio spec-
tral index of −0.13 and a ﬂux density at 1 GHz of 0.364 Jy
(Velusamy & Becker 1988). G54.1+0.3 has a small angular
radius in radio and X-ray images (1.5(cid:48)) and is thought to be
1800-2400 yr old (Bocchino et al. 2010). Its distance is some-
what uncertain with literature values ranging from 5−10 kpc
(Lu et al. 2002; Koo et al. 2008), here we use 6.2+3.8
−1.2 kpc from
Leahy et al. (2008). X-ray emission was detected with the
Einstein telescope, ASCA, ROSAT and Chandra. The latter
dataset resolved the SNR into a number of distinct X-ray
structures including a ring, an outer nebula and a pulsar
(Lu et al. 2002). CO observations toward G54.1+0.3 show
no-interaction with clouds and instead the SNR appears to
be located within a bubble (Lee et al. 2012; Lang et al.
2010). Very high energy γ-ray emission using the VERITAS
ground-based gamma-ray observatory was detected from the
young rotation-powered pulsar in G54.1+0.3 (Acciari et al.
2010). Temim et al. (2010) used Spitzer and Chandra ob-
servations of G54.1+0.3 to suggest that pulsar-wind nebula
is driving shocks into the expanding SN ejecta which is re-
sponsible for the IR morphology (see discussion in Section
4). They estimated dust mass in the IR shell 0.04-0.1 M(cid:12)
assuming a forsterite grain composition but without detailed
modeling of the dust composition and properties.

In this paper, we present 350µm (SHARC-II), 870µm
(LABOCA), and far-IR Herschel images of G54.1+0.3 (Sec-
tion 2) in addition to the Spitzer spectrum. Herschel images
are critical to estimate the mass of cold dust which will al-
low accurate dust mass, and we show detailed dust model-
ing by exploring diﬀerent dust grain compositions required
to match the observed spectra. We compare the dust fea-
tures revealed in G54.1+0.3 with that of the SNR Cas A.
We have presented our earlier results at meetings (Rho et al.
2010, 2012a) and the conference of F.O.E. 2015: Fifty-one
Erg1. After we almost complete our draft of this paper, we
note the paper by Temim et al. (2017). The spectral ﬁt-
ting has independent methods with diﬀerent grain composi-
tions, and our dust mass is comparable to (may be slightly

smaller than) those in Temim et al. (2017) (see Section 5.2
for details). We specially concentrate on pre-solar grains of
SiO2 to reproduce the 21µm dust feature and use diverse
choices of cold dust grains including temperature-dependent
silicate absorption coeﬃcient and Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, Al2O3,
FeS, carbon and Fe3O4. We also compare the IRS spectra of
G54.1+0.3 with various astronomical objects such as carbon
stars and protoplanetary nebulae.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 Mid-infrared Spectroscopy with Spitzer

We used archival Spitzer data of G54.1+0.3 with all
three instruments. Data from the Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC) was available from the GLIMPSE survey (Benjamin
et al. 2003) and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer
(MIPS) from the MIPSGAL survey. The MIPS and IRAC
observations took place on 2005 October 6 and 24, respec-
tively. The Spitzer MIPS 24µm image is shown in Figure
1. The bright ‘blob’ and diﬀuse emission from the remnant
are seen in both images. Analysis of the Infrared Spectro-
graph (IRS) dataset were previously presented by Temim
et al. (2010, 2017). The IRS observations took place on 2007
November 4. Here we re-analyzed the IRS data with CU-
BISM (Smith et al. 2007) in order to directly compare with
our results from Cas A (Rho et al. 2008; Arendt et al. 2014;
De Looze et al. 2017). We obtained recent data products that
were processed with the S18.18 version. The spectra below
8µm were relatively low (<5) signal-to-noise (the rest of spec-
tra have up to 600 signal-to-noise) and somewhat sensitive to
the background selection. The IRS slit coverage is shown in
Figure 1 including positions at the center and western shell
(position 1 and 2 in Temim et al. (2010), respectively). We
extracted the IRS SL and LL spectra (AORKEY: 23174656)
from the brightest diﬀuse ‘blob’ region seen toward the west-
ern shell (20 × 10(cid:48)(cid:48) across centered at R.A. 19h30m26.28s
and Dec. +18◦52(cid:48)20.0(cid:48)(cid:48), J2000). High resolution spectra with
IRS were taken toward two positions (AORKEY: 23175168);
the center position is at the same position as that of low
resolution spectrum, and the western shell position is at
R.A. 19h30m26.40s and Dec. +18◦52(cid:48)07.0(cid:48)(cid:48). High resolution
oﬀ-source (background) observation was taken (AORKEY:
23174912) toward R.A. 19h30m19.89s and Dec. +18◦51(cid:48)05.7(cid:48)(cid:48).
The ﬁnal high resolution spectra for the center and shell
positions were obtained after subtracting the oﬀ-source po-
sition. The locations of the spectral coverage are shown in
Figure 2.

2.2 Far-infrared and submm observations

2.2.1 Herschel

We used archival data from the Herschel Space Observa-
tory (Pilbratt et al. 2010, hereafter Herschel ) taken as part
of the HiGAL Legacy survey (Molinari et al. 2010) for the
Photodetector Array Camera (PACS; Poglitsch et al. 2010)
70 and 160 µm and the Spectral and Photometric Imag-
ing Receiver (SPIRE; Griﬃn et al. 2010) 250, 350 and 500
µm images (Table 1). The observations are taken in parallel
mode to maximize survey speed and wavelength coverage
and the instruments wavelength multiplexing capabilities.

We also created a PACS 100µm image using scan-map data
from obsids of 1342231921 and 1342231922 (OT1 ttemim 1).
PACS maps at wavelengths of 70, 100 and 160µm with a Full
Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of 6, 8 and 12(cid:48)(cid:48) and SPIRE
at 250, 350 and 500µm with FWHM of 18.1, 24.9 and 36.4(cid:48)(cid:48),
respectively. Data are taken from the arrays simultaneously
as the spacecraft is scanned across the sky. In order to have
redundancy two passes are taken over the same region of
the sky using the other scan angle at -42.5◦ angle which is
nearly orthogonal to the ﬁrst one and the distance between
each scan in parallel mode is set by the size of the PACS
array.

The PACS and SPIRE photometric data were re-
duced with the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment
(HIPE; Ott 2010). For PACS, all low-level reduction steps
were applied to Level 1 using HIPE and level 1 output was
imported to scanamorphos software (Roussel 2013) to re-
move eﬀect due to thermal drift and uncorrelated noise of
the individual bolometers. For the SPIRE data, additional
iterative baseline removal step (Bendo et al. 2010) was ap-
plied and the ﬁnal map was created with the standard naive
mapper.

The ﬂux calibration uncertainty for PACS is less than
10% (Poglitsch et al. 2010) and the expected color correc-
tions are small compared to the calibration errors. We there-
fore adopt a 10% calibration error for the 70 and 160µm
data. The SPIRE calibration methods and accuracies are
outlined by Swinyard et al. (2010) and are estimated to
be 7%. Note that we also examined Planck archival data
(e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. 2011) but the emission
from G54.1+0.3 could not be positively identiﬁed due to
the large angular size of the Planck beam (4.4-32.7(cid:48) from
857 to 30 GHz).

2.2.2 SHARC-II Data Reduction

Higher resolution observations of G54.1+0.3 at 350µm
were provided by observations with SHARC-II (Table 1).
SHARC-II is a 12× 32 bolometer array with ﬁeld of view
of 2.6(cid:48) × 0.97(cid:48) on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
in Hawaii. The Dish Surface Optimization System (DSOS)
was used throughout the run, providing a stable beam with
FWHM of 8.5(cid:48)(cid:48). The weather conditions were good during
both runs, with τ225 ranging from 0.04 to 0.05. 22 scans
were observed in total using the boxscan format with scan-
ning speed of 20 scans per second with on-source integration
time of 3.7 hours. The sources Callisto, Neptune, Arp220,
G34.3 and Hebe were used for pointing, focusing and ﬂux
correction. The focus was found to be stable within 5 mm.
Pointing was measured to be oﬀset by 8(cid:48)(cid:48), this was cor-
rected in the data reduction. The data were reduced with
the SHARC-II data reduction package CRUSH version 1.6.3
(Kov´acs et al. 2006). The background noise in the central re-
gion is ∼80 mJy beam−1. The ﬂux uncertainties include the
ﬂux calibration uncertainty, which is typically 15%.

2.2.3 LABOCA Data Reduction

We supplemented the Herschel and SHARC-II data with
870µm observations taken with the LABOCA camera
(Siringo et al. 2009), a 295-pixel bolometer array with beam

EXperiment telescope (G¨usten et al. 2006) on Chanjantor in
Chile (Table 1). The observations were carried out in raster
spiral mode with forty scans, each providing a fully sam-
pled map over 8 × 8(cid:48). The total on-source integration time
was 4.7 hours. Two independent measurements of the opti-
cal depth, τ were obtained. The ﬁrst method used the pre-
cipitable water vapor (PWV) levels measured every minute
along the line of sight, then scaled using the relevant at-
mospheric transmission model. The PWV was low but vari-
able, ranging from 0.5–0.8 mm. The second method calcu-
lated τ from skydip measurements, where a model of the
dependence of the eﬀective sky temperature on elevation
were ﬁtted to determine the zenith opacity. The two skydips
taken before and after the on-source scans were both well

ﬁtted by the model, with τ between 0.16-0.19. These values
were, on average, 30% lower than those estimated from the
PWV measurements. A linear combination of the two meth-
ods, and a ﬁnal comparison with the calibrator models (e.g.
Siringo et al. 2009), was used to determine the values used
in the data reduction.

The data were reduced using the BoA (BOlometer ar-
ray Analysis software) package. The focus was checked on
observations of Jupiter and G34.3 and were stable within
±0.2 mm. Pointing observations of Jupiter were within 2(cid:48)(cid:48) in
azimuth and elevation. Bad and noisy pixels were ﬂagged.
The data were de-spiked and correlated noise was removed
(removing a large fraction of the sky noise Schuller et al.
2009). The reduction was optimized for the recovery of weak
sources. All of the scans were coadded (weighted by rms−2)

mediate surroundings, suggesting that the 70µm emission is
indeed associated with the remnant. H II regions and young
stellar objects are instead bright in all three bands, and ap-
pear white in this image, with interstellar cirrus from unre-
lated foreground and background dust emission appearing
blue.

Zooming in on the remnant, the MIR images (Figure
5), show bright emission from a shell-like structure (here-
after the shell) located at the southern end of the radio
emission, with peak brightness in the western side. We see
IR emission extending north from the western peak of the
shell. In Figure 4, we next compare the Spitzer MIR data to
the FIR images. At long wavelengths (λ > 100µm), we see
a slight change to the distribution of the IR emission: the
eastern part of the shell begins to fade in brightness and the
northern elongated structure becomes more prominent. This
feature is particularly obvious when we resolve the Herschel
emission in the higher resolution LABOCA 870µm image
(Figure 5), though the peak emission in the LABOCA im-
age is slightly oﬀset towards the pulsar location compared to
the 24 and 70µm emission. The elongated northern structure
seen in the Herschel and LABOCA data is coincident with
the same structure seen in the IRAC 8µm image (Figure 5).
The SHARC-II 350µm image provides us with a means to re-
solve out the submm emission seen with Herschel at 350µm:
here we see a smaller structure coincident with the brightest
peaks in the 24, 70 and 160µm images (in the western part
of the shell). The detection of submm and far-IR detection
from G54.1+0.3 and its coincidence with the IRAC 8µm
emission (western peak and elongated north west structure)
and the Spitzer 24µm (shell structure) hints that the FIR
emission could originate from cold dust associated with the
SNR (we return to this in Section 4). The CSO SHARCII
submm image at 350µm has a factor of 3 higher spatial res-
olution compared to the SPIRE image at 350µm, and the
SHARCII image shows small scale structures that resemble
those in the 8µm image (see Figures 5a and 5c).

In Figure 6 we compare the FIR emission with the well
studied X-ray and radio data for G54.1+0.3 using archival
Chandra and Very Large Array (VLA, 4.45 GHz) observa-
tions. In X-ray we see the pulsar at the center and the pulsar
wind nebula extending east - west (e.g Lu et al. 2002). In
radio, we see many diﬀerent structures including lobes, ﬁl-
aments, and diﬀuse emission (see Lang et al. 2010 for more
information). The radio emission in general extends perpen-
dicular to the X-ray with a narrow ‘waist’ region at the
center coincident with the X-ray diﬀuse structure. We also
see asymmetry in the radio emission with the remnant ap-
pearing brighter in the south. The ‘double-pronged’ feature
in the north appears jet-like. (We note that we see no radio
feature coincident with the pulsar, Lang et al. 2010.) When
we compare with the FIR emission (using Herschel 70µm,
bottom left, red) we see that the bright FIR shell-like emis-
sion is distributed to the south of the X-ray emission and on
the southern edge of the diﬀuse radio that traces the pulsar
wind. Figures 4 and 6 show clearly that the FIR/submm
structure that extends north from the shell on the western
side also encompasses the X-ray and radio at the center,
tracing the outer edge. Lang et al. (2010) suggested that
the IR shell-like emission was due to the interaction of the
PWN with an interstellar cloud. In contrast, Temim et al.
(2010, 2017) suggested that the PWN is driving shocks into

to create the ﬁnal map. After a ﬁrst iteration of the reduc-
tion, the source map was used to ﬂag bright sources and the
data were reduced again. This was eﬃcient at removing neg-
ative artifacts which appeared around the bright sources in
the ﬁrst iteration and led to a more stable background noise
level in the central region (∼10 mJy beam−1). The calibra-
tors Jupiter, G34.3, J1925+211 and J1751+097 were used to
calibrate the map. The total uncertainty in the calibration,
including uncertainties in the calibrator model is ∼12%.

an expanding SN ejecta. The structure seen in Figure 6 is re-
markably similar to that of the Crab Nebula where the FIR
emission also surrounded the inner radio and X-ray emis-
sion (Gomez et al. 2012b). In that work, the FIR emission
was shown to originate from dust formed in the SN ejecta
and not due to the interaction with circumstellar or inter-
stellar material despite being brighter in the outer regions of
the X-ray and radio emission. They suggested that the Crab
Nebula does not have a forward shock such that the pulsar
wind nebula is able to expand into the freely expanding SN
ejecta (Hester 2008; Smith 2013). As well as a low interstel-
lar density surrounding the Crab, this can be explained if the

Crab was the result of a low-energy Type IIn-P event from
a relatively low mass star (Smith 2013). In this scenario the
SN ejecta interacts with a thin shell of circumstellar material
and the expansion of the pulsar wind nebula accelerates and
fragments the Crab ﬁlaments. Given that the PWNs within
G54.1+0.3 and the Crab Nebula have shown to be similar
(Kim et al. 2013), we now posit in this work that a sim-
ilar mechanism (dust formed in the ejecta material) could
be responsible for the IR-submm appearance of G54.1+0.3.
Based on spectral ejecta lines and dust features similar to
that of Cas A, we interpret the IR emission is from ejecta
and associated dust. However, since the spectral coverage is

of PWN with interstellar clouds. We will return to this in
Sections 3.2 and 4 for details.

3.2 Ejecta Lines and Dust from MIR spectroscopy

3.2.1 Supernova Ejecta Lines

The Spitzer IRS spectra include a set of low-res spectra (L,
resolving power of 65-120) towards the southwestern shell
and two sets of high-res (H, resolving power of 600) spectra
toward the center and the southwestern shell (Figure 7). The
low-res IRS spectra show bright [Ar II] emission at 6.9µm,
[Ne II] at 12.8µm, [S III] at 18.7 and 33.5µm, and [Si II] at
34.89µm.

The surface brightnesses of the low-res lines are cor-
rected for extinction using NH = 1.6 × 1022 cm−2 from X-ray
measurements (Lu et al. 2002) (see Table 2). The line bright-
nesses of high-res spectra were listed in Temim et al. (2010).
Our estimate shows that the emission seen in the IRAC 8µm
image (see Figure 5) is composed of Ar ejecta at 20 percent
and 9µm broad dust feature at 80 percent using the IRS low-
res spectrum after convolving the IRAC transmission curve
(see Figure 1 of Reach et al. 2016). The 9µm broad dust
feature is ﬁt with silica dust and is associated with the SN
ejecta (see Section 4.2 for details).

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2018)

We also detect the [Cl II] line at ∼14µm. The rest
wavelength of this line (14.3678µm) is very close to [Ne V]
(14.3217µm), though we do not detect any emission from
[Ne V] in the expected 24.3µm line. The line proﬁle for
[Cl II] is shown in Figure 8. Although it is not resolved
in the low-res spectrum, the high-res IRS spectrum resolves
the line into two velocity components seen in both the shell
and central regions of the SNR. We ﬁt them using two gaus-
sians and the central velocities and widths with their errors
are given in Table 2; both spectra show that the two knots
are located at the central velocity of −650 km s−1 (located
at the front side of the SNR) and ∼200 km s−1 (located at
the backside of the SNR), and their widths are ∼380 km s−1
and ∼700 km s−1, respectively, which indicates that they are
high velocity ejecta knots. This is diﬀerent from Temim et al.
(2010) who measured the velocity using high-res spectra and
found a single gaussian component was adequate. The low-
res spectra used here covers regions that were not covered
in their analysis and demonstrate diﬀerent line proﬁles re-
quiring multiple-components. Combined, this work indicates
there are at least two ejecta clumps of the fast-moving ejecta
material existing in diﬀerent places along the line of sight.

Interesting dust features are seen at 21 and 9µm; the
former is a smooth peak increasing in ﬂux up to 21µm and
decreasing beyond this. Another dust feature appears as a
bump at 11.3µm (10-13µm). The high-res spectra shows that

pared to the Spitzer 8µm , CSO SHARCII image at 350µm
and Herschel 160µm image. The [Ar II] ejecta shows a mor-
phology similar to the SHARCII 350µm dust emission (see
Figure 9), indicating that the Ar ejecta are associated with
the dust. The IRAC 8µm image shows small-scale structures
similar to those in the SHARCII image at 350µm whereas
the image shows large-scale structures similar to those in the
Herschel 160µm cold dust map, in particular, in the north-
western shell. The IRAC 8µm image seems to contain not
only Ar ejecta emission but also additional continuum emis-
sion which may be associated with a combination of cold
and warm dust.

There is additional supporting evidence that the Ar
ejecta of G54.1+0.3 might be associated with dust based
on the analogy of the SNR G54.1+0.3 to Cas A. Both
G54.1+0.3 and Cas A show a 21µm dust feature (see §3.2.2
for details, see Figure 7), and the map of Ar ejecta in Cas A
is remarkably similar to the 21µm dust map where dust is
formed in the SN ejecta (see Figure 2 of Rho et al. 2008).
The element Ar is one of the oxygen burning products at
the inner-oxygen and S-Si layers, with the 21µm-peak dust
forming around these nucleosynthetic layers (e.g., Woosley &
Weaver 1995, see more discussion in Rho et al. 2008; Nozawa
et al. 2003).

In the Crab Nebula, the dust is found to be associated
with the ejecta (Gomez et al. 2012c, and references therein).
We suggest that in SNR G54.1+0.3, the dust is also asso-
ciated with the ejecta. The analogy of the SNR G54.1+0.3
to the Crab Nebula, where the infrared and optical/infrared
shells show overabundant ejecta knots, and the high resolu-
tion images show almost one-to-one correspondence between
ejecta and dust knots with prominent ﬁnger-shaped knots
caused by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (more discussion in
Section 4; Hester 2008; Jun 1998), suggests that the ejecta
of G54.1+0.3 are likely associated with the dust. Hopefully,
future spectral mapping such as with JWST will further
conﬁrm the correlation between the ejecta and dust for the
entire SNR of G54.1+0.3.

3.2.2 21µm dust feature: a dust twin of Cas A

As well as ejecta lines, as discussed in the previous Section,
the low-res spectra show a strong dust feature peaking at

Figure 6. Three color image of G54.1+0.3 with blue, green and
red colour indicating X-ray, radio and FIR (Herschel PACS at
70µm) emission respectively. The Herschel image shows a torus-
like shell emission (15◦ tilted from the horizon) and consistent
with the 24µm emission. The radio pulsar nebula is perpendic-
ular to this torus structure. The Herschel images (see Figure 4)
also show an emission feature extended north of this shell on the
western side of the remnant. The north is up and the west is right.
Color bar scale is 0.62 - 13.20 ×10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 in blue,
0.15 - 1.75 MJy sr−1 in green, and 0.004 - 0.75 Jy pixel−1 (1 pixel
= 1.4(cid:48)(cid:48)) in red.

the feature has additional peak at 11.2µm (see next Section).
The IRS spectrum (Figure 7) indicates that Spitzer IRAC
8µm map in Figure 5 is from a combination of the Ar eject
map and the 9µm dust.

Understanding the correlation between dust and Ar
ejecta requires spectral mapping to cover the entire SNR as
it was done for Cas A (Rho et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2009).
Unfortunately, such data are not available for G54.1+0.3.
We still generated the Ar image shown in Figure 9b by us-
ing the IRS staring mode (one slit) after subtracting the
continuum by spectral ﬁtting. The [Ar II] image is com-

21µm, with additional (weaker) dust features at 8.5µm and
10 - 14µm. In Figure 10, we compare the IRS spectrum of
Cas A from Rho et al. (2008) with G54.1+0.3 and ﬁnd that
the 21µm dust feature is remarkably similar to that seen in
Cas A. (Unlike Cas A, G54.1+0.3’s ﬂux continues to rise
well beyond the 21µm peak.) Historically, the term ‘21µm
dust feature’ was allocated to the spectral feature seen in
carbon-rich post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars
(Sloan et al. 2014), evolved stars (Kwok et al. 1989) and
protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe, Volk et al. 2011; Jiang et al.
2005); this feature is often accompanied by a peak at 30µm
(see also Figure 11). However, note that the historical 21µm
feature actually peaks between 20-20.3µm (Kwok et al. 1989;
Li et al. 2013; Cerrigone et al. 2011). We distinguish this
feature (we call “20µm dust feature”) from our 21µm feature
observed in the SNRs of G54.1+0.3 and Cas A.

Comparing the Spitzer spectra of the two SNRs with
PPNe from Volk et al. (2011) (Figure 11), we see that the
PPN feature is oﬀset by ∼1µm from the 21.1µm dust fea-
ture in G54.1+0.3 and in Cas A. Unlike the PPNe, neither

SNR has a broad dust bump at 30µm, though they do have
weaker dust features between 10-15µm (see Section 3.2.3).
The 21µm dust feature therefore seems to be unique to the
two young SNRs of Cas A and G54.1+0.3 to date. We will
return to the dust composition responsible for this feature
in Section 4.

3.2.3 11µm dust features

Weaker dust features are seen in the IRS spectra in the 10-
14µm range (Figures 1 and 10). In particular, a broad emis-
sion feature is present ranging from approximately 10.5 to
14µm with, on top of it, a strong distinct feature at 11.2
µm. The broad feature is much more noticeable in the shell
spectrum when we subtract the center spectrum after scal-
ing the spectra with the sharp 11.2µm feature as shown in
Figures 12 and 13a. To investigate this emission, we apply
a global spline continuum with anchor points shortward of
11µm and longward of 13 µm (Figure 13a). The overall shape
of the 10-14 µm emission is similar in the two SH spectra

The spectra from the shell and central regions are shown in blue
and green, respectively. The line shows multiple (high velocity)
components in emission (the two-component gaussian ﬁts listed
in Table 2).

Figure 10. Comparing the Spitzer IRS MIR spectrum for
G54.1+0.3 with Cas A. The 21µm dust feature of G54.1+0.3 is
similar to that of Cas A, showing that the feature is unique dust
originated from supernovae. The spectra shown on log-scale high-
lights the dust feature seen at ∼12.7µm (between 10 and 14µm) in
the low res spectrum (SL in green, LL2 in yellow and LL1 in red)
and the ‘sharper’ dust feature at 11µm seen in the high resolution
spectrum (in blue) of G54.1+0.3.

while the strength of both the broad emission feature and
the distinct 11.2 µm feature varies (Figure 13b). While less
clear in the SL spectrum due to the lower S/N and spectral
resolution, we note that the 10-14 µm emission features are
very similar to those in the SH shell spectrum when allow-
ing for a scaling factor of 0.6 to match the strength of the
dust continuum emission. (The relative strength of the broad
emission feature and the 11.2 µm band is slightly diﬀerent.)
A comparison with the SL data of Cas A reveals that this
broad emission component is also present in Cas A, albeit
at a weaker level, while the distinct feature at 11.2µm seems
to be absent (Figure 10).

The distinct feature at 11.2 µm is reminiscent of the
11.2 µm emission band due to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydro-
carbon molecules (PAHs). To explore a possible PAH origin,
we follow Hony et al. (2001) and apply a local spline con-

phology similar to the IRAC 8µm image and SHARCII 350µm
dust emission within the elliptical region, and [Ar II] ejecta emis-
sion is correlated to the dust emission. Note that SHARCII 350µm
image (c) has a factor of 1.5 higher spatial resolution to that of
the Herschel 160µm image (d).

tinuum: in addition to the anchor points used for the global
spline continuum, two additional anchor points at approx-
imately 11.7 and 13 µm are used (Figure 13, top panel).
We compare the resulting continuum subtracted SH spectra
with the PAH emission seen in the sample of Hony et al.
(2001).

The emission seen towards the SH center position is
nearly identical to the PAH emission of the planetary neb-
ula (PN) IRAS21282+5050: at the position of the 11.0, 11.2
and 12.7µm PAH bands in the PN, the SH center spectrum
shows emission bands with almost identical shape, e.g., the
11.2µm PAH feature. A small discrepancy is also seen at the
transition from the 11.0 to the 11.2 µm PAH bands (the 11.0
µm as a shoulder attached to the 11.2 µm band versus two
more distinct bands). Both PAH proﬁles have been seen in a
variety of objects and within extended sources (e.g. Boersma
et al. 2013). The observed emission towards the SH center
position (when subtracting a local spline continuum) is thus
consistent with an origin in PAH emission. Note that the
spectrum at the center was already background subtracted
using the background position 2.5 arcmin away as shown in
Figure 1.

The SH shell spectrum clearly exhibits the 11.2 µm
PAH band and lacks emission near 11.0 and 13.5 µm. The
11.0 µm is a weaker PAH band attributed to ionized PAHs
(Hudgins & Allamandola 1999) and thus is only seen for a
signiﬁcant PAH ionization fraction. Hence, the lack thereof

poses no problem to a PAH origin of the 11.2 µm emission.
The emission in roughly 11.8 to 13 µm is somewhat un-
usual from a PAH perspective. Clearly, this emission can be
consistent with the presence of a 12.7 µm PAH band (at var-
ious strengths). However, typically, this feature ranges from
roughly 12.2 to 12.9 µm and a weaker PAH band at 12.0 µm
is discernible (i.e. not blended) when present (see the PN
shown in Figure 13 or Figure 7 of Hony et al. 2001). Note
that a typical PAH emission spectrum ranges between 10
and 15 µm.

In contrast, the SH shell spectrum exhibits a smooth
increase in surface brightness starting from ∼11.7 µm up
to ∼13 µm. A similar proﬁle is seen towards one or two β
objects in the sample of Matsuura et al. (2014, see their Fig.
14, e.g. IRAS05360-7121). Therefore, we conclude that the
observed 11.2 µm feature is consistent with an origin in PAH
emission while an origin of (some of) the 11.7-13 µm in PAH
emission is possible, yet uncertain.

While PAH emission is thus present in these SH spectra,
we note that the SH background spectrum exhibits typical
and much stronger PAH emission. This is well illustrated in
Figure 12. The 11.0, 11.2 and 12.7 µm PAH emission bands
are clearly present and resemble a typical PAH emission
spectrum (see Figure 13). However, this background PAH
emission is much stronger than that detected on-source: the
11.2 µm PAH intensity in the on-source spectra accounts for
6 and 20% of that seen in the SH background, respectively,

fortunately, discrepancies between the PAH band intensities
between SL and SH observations (see e.g. Fig. 3 of Peeters
et al. 2017) exclude a comparison of the 11.2 µm PAH band
intensity between SH and SL observations at the 20% level,
as required by our on-source observations. Given the proxim-
ity of the center and shell position to each other (the center
positions of the two slits are 25(cid:48)(cid:48) apart and the slit cover-
ages are next to each other as shown in Figure 1), we assume
similar background emission for both positions. In that case,
the maximum residual background emission is given by the
strength of the PAH emission seen in the center position.
When the spectrum of the shell position is corrected for this
possible remaining residual PAH emission, it still exhibits

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2018)

clear PAH emission (in particular the 11.2 µm band, see
Figure 12).

PAH emission gives rise to a number of emission bands,
the major ones centered at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.2 µm. We
thus expect to see the 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 µm PAH bands as well
towards the shell. Unfortunately, these bands are located in
the SL wavelength range where the data are of signiﬁcantly
lower quality and we do not detect any emission in SL2 (5.5-
8.5 µm) except from the [ArII] and potential [Ni I] lines. We
compared our SL spectrum with the IRS spectrum from a
well-known PAH source, the reﬂection nebula NGC 7023, by
normalizing its spectrum so that the integrated strength of
the 11.2µm PAH band equals that observed in the SL shell
spectrum (Figure 10). Given the strength of the 11.2 µm
PAH band in the SL spectrum, we should have seen PAH
emission at 6.2 and 7.7 µm since they are above the noise
level. If born out that the 11.2µm PAH emission belongs to
the SNR, this would be the ﬁrst detection of PAHs associ-
ated with SN ejecta. This challenges both observations and
theoretical models; none of the molecule and dust formation
models mentioned above have predicted formation of PAHs
in SN ejecta.

tracted spectra using the global spline continuum, normalized to
the strength at 11.2 µm (the [NeII] emission line is cut oﬀ for

reference, a smoothed version of the continuum subtracted SH
center spectrum is over-plotted in green. (c: bottom) A compari-
son of the PAH emission features in this wavelength range (using

2001), normalized to the peak intensity of the 11.2 µm PAH band
(the [NeII] emission line is cut oﬀ for clarity). The spectra are
oﬀset from each other by 1.5 units.

We extract the proﬁle of the broad emission component
by subtracting the emission seen towards the center from
that towards the shell with the former scaled such that the
integrated intensity of the 11.2 µm PAH band is equal to that
in the shell. This implicitly assumes the band proﬁle does
not change between the two positions. The resulting proﬁle
is a smooth, symmetric feature from roughly 11.5 to 13 µm
shown in Figure 12. A comparison is made between the cen-

a Gaussian with peak position of 12.3 µm and a FWHM of
1.1 µm. Possible carriers of this broad emission feature are
PAHs or PAH-related species and SiC grains.

The 11.2 and 12.7 µm PAH bands are typically located
on top of a broad emission plateau ranging from roughly 10.5
µm to roughly 14.5 µm. While this broad emission plateau
shows little variation towards ISM-type sources (see e.g. Fig.
12 in Peeters et al. 2017), large variability is seen towards
evolved stars exhibiting PAH emission (Sloan et al. 2014;
Matsuura et al. 2014). Comparing a typical ISM-like PAH
plateau with the broad emission feature seen in the SNR
shows that the latter is considerably more narrow. We ex-
plore the possibility that the broad dust feature between
10-14µm is from SiC, with spectral ﬁtting described in Sec-
tion 4 (see Figures 16 and 17).

3.3 Warm and Cool Dust Distribution

We have generated temperature and dust mass maps us-
ing 0.2◦ × 0.2◦ cutouts of the 24µm, 70µm, 160µm, 250µm,
350µm, and 500µm maps. We have re-gridded the maps
that are aligned to the same pixel grid, with 6(cid:48)(cid:48) pixels, and
smoothed each map to the 36(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution of the 500µm im-
age, and ﬁt a simple 2-component modiﬁed black-body spec-
tral energy distribution (SED) to each pixel.

This method will distinguish between warm and cool
dust components. We note that a more physical model would
account for multiple temperature components, though in
terms of deriving dust masses, the assumption of two com-
ponents makes only a factor of 2 diﬀerence in the deriva-
tion of dust mass (see Mattsson et al. 2014). The ﬁtting was
performed using a chi-squared-minimizing routine which in-
corporates the color-corrections for ﬁlter response function
and beam area (see Gomez et al. 2012b for details), assumed
an emissivity slope of β=2.0 and used a dust mass absorp-
tion coeﬃcient of κ at 500µm = 0.051 kg m−2 (Clark et al.
2016). Note that for a pixel with an SED that is best ﬁt by
a single-component model (such as pixels with foreground
cirrus only), this method will eﬀectively yield a ‘second’

component with no mass (i.e., negligible mass with a large
uncertainty, compatible with zero).

Figure 14 shows temperature and dust maps of the hot
and cold components. The hot dust mass is concentrated
toward the central area (slightly to the west) and the cold
dust mass is concentrated to the northern and central parts
of the SNR; the maps are consistent with the diﬀerence be-
tween the 24µm and 160µm images. The temperature where
the cold dust mass is concentrated ranges from 18 to 25
K as shown in Figure 14d, and the cold temperature ex-
tends as low as ∼18 K in the northeast direction where
a thin shell exist in the infrared maps (in all bands). We
have attempted to produce dust mass and temperature maps
with a higher (18(cid:48)(cid:48)) spatial resolution using Herschel super-
resolution maps (e.g. at 500µm) and removed synchrotron
emission using a radio map. However, no additional informa-
tion was obtained from that exercise, and because the SNR
G54.1+0.3 is small, the high-resolution maps may contain
artefacts. We conclude that the low-resolution maps were
suﬃcient for this purpose.

We compare our temperature maps with those by
Temim et al. (2017). We note that Temim et al. (2017)
used observations from 15µm to 100µm for their temper-
ature maps with a resulting spatial resolution of 12(cid:48)(cid:48) and
were able to ﬁt only a single dust component. In contrast,

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2018)

we used maps from 24 to 500µm where the longer wave-
length maps are sensitive to the cold dust, and were able
to ﬁt two-temperature dust components and generated two
temperature maps. This results in very diﬀerent tempera-
tures when comparing the two temperature maps. The tem-
perature map by Temim et al. (2017) ranges 35-45K range,
while our temperature map from the cold component spans
18-25K and the map from the warm component spans 50-
65K. Their map temperatures are compatible with those in
our warm temperature map given the diﬀerence in wave-
length coverage.

4 THE BROAD-BAND SPECTRAL ENERGY
DISTRIBUTION AND DUST FEATURES

To derive dust masses in G54.1+0.3, we generated a com-
plete SED from the MIR-submm for G54.1+0.3 (blue data
points in Figure 16) by combining Spitzer IRS spectra
with Spitzer, Herschel, SHARC-II and LABOCA photom-
etry. The low-resolution Spitzer spectra was used as it pro-
vides extra coverage over the 5-8µm range and highlights
the broad dust features in the NIR and MIR. To combine
the spectra with the broadband SED, we determined the
total ﬂux density (in Jy) of the entire SNR using Spitzer

16

J. Rho

24µm image and scaled the low-res IRS spectrum to match
the Spitzer 24µm ﬂux. There is no signiﬁcant change in the
spectrum along the slit, and the IRS spectrum at relatively
short wavelengths is to constrain the dust compositions and
the dust mass is largely constraint by far-IR data points
from Herschel photometry. The estimated ﬂux densities of
G54.1+0.3 in submm and far-infrared are summarized in Ta-
ble 32. At the long IR wavelengths, the largest contribution
to the ﬂux uncertainty can originate from the background
variation. We varied the choice of background region when
measuring the ﬂux density of G54.1+0.3 at various wave-
lengths and found the ﬂux at 350µm and 500µm changed up
to 20% depending on the location of the background aper-
ture. This is due to increasing amount of interstellar cirrus
in the vicinity of the SNR at the longest wavelengths. The
FIR-submm ﬂuxes along with their uncertainties are listed
in Table 3.

As G54.1+0.3 is Crab-like, radio-bright SNR, syn-
chrotron emission could be an important contributor at FIR-
submm wavelengths particularly at 500-870µm (as seen in
the Crab, Gomez et al. 2012b). Using the Very Large Ar-
ray (VLA) map at 1 GHz with spectral slope Sν ∝ ν−0.16
(Leahy et al. 2008; Velusamy & Becker 1988; Lang et al.
2010) and integrating the ﬂux within the same aperture used
to measure the submm ﬂux, we estimate that ∼0.15 Jy at
870µm is likely to originate from synchrotron (∼60% of the
total ﬂux). At 350µm, we would expect 0.13 Jy of ﬂux due
to synchrotron emission (<10%). However, comparing the
structure of the submm emission seen in the 350 and 870µm
bands (Figure 5), there is very little similarity between the
distribution of the emission seen in radio and the 24µm or
submm Figures 6 and 5). Therefore, we excluded 870µm data
in the spectral ﬁtting, but overplotted in the ﬁt results in
Figures 16, 18 and 20. Hereafter, we ﬁt the dust SED after
freezing a synchrotron model with the spectral index of 0.16
and a ﬂux density of 0.364 Jy at 1 GHz. The ﬂux at 870µm
is slightly above the synchrotron radiation or is consistent
with the radiation within the error.

In an attempt to obtain a better ﬁt to the SED of
G54.1+0.3, we use the same SED ﬁtting routine used for
Cas A, but now try diﬀerent grain compositions and diﬀer-
ent grain models. Speciﬁcally, we use the continuous distri-
butions of ellipsoidals (CDE) grain model for SiO2 (silica)
and SiC (Silicon carbide) (Bohren & Huﬀman 1985); the ab-
sorption eﬃciency for this grain species and others is shown
in Figure 15. The ﬁrst results of ﬁtting using SiO2 to re-
produce the 21µm dust feature in Cas A were presented in
conference proceeding (Rho et al. 2009a). The dust contin-
uum is ﬁt with the Planck function [Bν(T)] multiplied by the
absorption eﬃciency (Qabs) for various dust compositions,
varying the amplitude and temperature of each component.
The optical constants of the grain species used in the calcu-
lation are the same as those of Hirashita et al. (2005), ex-
cept for amorphous SiO2 (Philipp 1985), amorphous Al2O3
(Begemann et al. 1997) and we apply Mie theory (Bohren &
Huﬀman 1985) to calculate the absorption eﬃciencies, Qabs,
assuming the grains are small a(cid:54)0.01 µm (Nozawa & Kozasa
2013; Nozawa et al. 2010).

2 The ﬂux density of the SNR at 350µm in the SHARC-II and
Herschel SPIRE images are comparable within the ﬂux errors.

Figure 15. Optical constants for spherical silicate dust grains rel-
evant for this work, including spherical grains of SiO2 (red dotted
line), SiC (orange dotted line), MgSiO3 (green), and Mg2SiO4
(dark green). The continuous distribution of ellipsoidal (CDE)
models for SiO2 (red solid line) and SiC (orange solid line) are
also shown (see the text for details).

The dust mass of i-grain type is given by:

Mdust,i =

Fi
ν d2
Bν(Td,i) κi

=

Fi
ν d2
Bν(Td,i)

4 ρi a
3 Qabs,i

where Fi
ν is the ﬂux from i-grain species, d is the distance,
Bν is the Planck function, ρi is the bulk density, and a is the
dust particle size. We ﬁt the ﬂux density for each spectral
type using scale factors Ci for each grain type i, such that
Fi
ν = Σi Ci Bν Qabs,i/a, where Q(λ, a) are calculated using
Mie theory Bohren & Huﬀman (1985) and assuming a rela-
tively small grain size a = 0.01 µm (Nozawa & Kozasa 2013).
Note that the calculated values of Qabs/a are independent
of the grain size (a) for a <<0.1 µm at these wavelengths
(i.e. as long as 2π|m|a/λ <<1 where m is the complex re-
fractive index). Thus the derived scale factor Ci as well as
the estimated dust mass (see Section 4.4) are independent
of the radius of the dust. We applied this technique in our
previous papers by Rho et al. (2009c); Arendt et al. (2014);
Rho et al. (2008). The dust compositions of the best ﬁts are
summarized in Table 4.

We have quantiﬁed the goodness of ﬁt ( χ2) for the mod-
els using the mpfit IDL routine (Markwardt 2009), though
we note that there are degeneracies between the many diﬀer-
ent grain species that can ﬁt the SED. The diﬀerent models
we tried with diﬀerent grain compositions are described in
full in Table 4. Note that the goodness of ﬁt may depend on
initial selection of grain composition.

4.1 Silica for 21µm dust and Silicon Carbide for

11µm dust features

Rho et al. (2008) ﬁtted the IRS spectra and 21µm dust
peak feature using a combination of grains that included
SiO2 (silica), Mg protosilicates, and FeO grains (their so-
called Model A). However, Rho et al. (2008) noted that the
21µm feature was not perfectly reproduced with this model

Figure 16. The spectral energy distribution of the SNR G54.1+0.3 from MIR - submm wavelengths (the broadband photometry from
Table 3 and the IRS spectra are shown by blue data points) superposed on the dust ﬁt of model A1 (see Table 4). The data and the
total ﬁt are shown in blue and thick red lines, respectively, and Herschel ﬂuxes are marked with squares. The dust temperatures are
shown in parentheses, and the dotted lines are from the second temperature components. Synchrotron continuum contribution (green
dashed line) is estimated based on the radio ﬂuxes . The 21µm and 11µm dust features are well produced by the CDE grain model of
Silica and Silicon carbide (SiC), respectively. As well as the dust features and compositions required to ﬁt the IRS spectrum of the SNR,
we require a population of colder dust grains to explain the ﬂuxes at wavelengths beyond 70 µm (see Section 4 for details). The diﬀerent
grain compositions required and ﬁtting properties highlighted individually in this plot are listed in full in Table 4.

as shown in Figure 3 of their paper. Here we attempt to do a
similar analysis for G54.1+0.3. We ﬁrst performed spectral
ﬁtting of the 21µm-peak dust using the CDE grain model
of SiO2 and spherical model for MgSiO3. The comparison of
absorption coeﬃcient between the spherical and CDE grain
model in Figure 15 show that the SiO2 and SiC CDE features
are smoother, broader feature than those of spherical grain
models. Here we ﬁnd that the 21 µm peak dust for spec-
tra of G54.1+0.3 is reasonably well ﬁt by SiO2 in Figure 16
without requiring Mg proto-silicates nor FeO in contrast to
the original Cas A study. In addition, the newly identiﬁed
11-12.5µm feature seen here (Figure 10) can be ﬁt with the
SiC CDE grain model.

For a SiC grain of a given size ”a” and a given 21µm
feature strength (Qabs/a), Jiang et al. (2005) calculate its
equilibrium temperature and its emission spectrum to gen-
erate both dust feature at 11.3 and 21µm. However, the re-
quired strength for the 21µm feature is stronger than that
for the 11.3 µm feature of SiC. Because the low-res spectrum
covered an additional wavelength coverage at 5-10 µm which
include the 9µm dust feature (see Figure 11), we used the
low-res IRS spectrum together with Herschel photometry
data for dust spectral ﬁttings.

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2018)

After we ﬁt the CDE models of SiO2 and SiC to repro-
duce the 21µm and 11µm dust features obtained in the low-
res spectra of G54.1+0.3, we incorporate other grain com-
positions based on Model A from Rho et al. (2008) including
amorphous FeS (150 K) and Mg2SiO4 (58 K) to account for
the emission between 5-30µm, and Al2O3 to reproduce the
spectra beween 30-500µm3. We also include grains of SiO2
at high temperature (300 K) to account for the emission fea-
ture around 9.8µm, but this component is added to mimic
IR emission from stochastic heating (e.g. Rho et al. 2008,
2009c; Lagage et al. 1996). This model is shown in Figure 16
(Model A1); the ﬁt produces a reduced χ2 of 3.7 and yields
a total dust mass for the SNR of 0.16 M(cid:12) (Table 4).

As Model A1 is a good ﬁt to G54.1+0.3, we next de-
termine if this updated combination of grain compositions
can also provide a better ﬁt to the Cas A spectra compared
to Rho et al. (2008). Figure 17 shows that indeed the CDE
SiO2 and SiC grains provide a better ﬁt for the 21µm and

upper limit because a portion of the 870µm may be from fore-
ground material of molecular clouds.

SiO2 and SiC, which fairly well reproduce the 21µm and 11µm
dust features, respectively.

11µm dust features of Cas A, removing the residual seen in
the IR in the earlier study. We note however that the IRS
spectral coverage for G54.1+0.3 is limited to the center and
south-western shell, and full spectral coverage may reveal
diﬀerent nucleosynthetic layers like those in Cas A. Temim
et al. (2017) ﬁt the 21µm dust feature of G54.1+0.3 with
Mg0.7SiO2.7 and stated that they could not ﬁt the 21µm
feature using SiO2 grains. We note that the shape of ab-
sorption coeﬃcient of SiO2 (Figure 4 of Temim et al. 2017)
is diﬀerent from the one we used in Figure 15. Our ﬁts with
SiO2 reproduced the 21µm dust feature very well and the
theoretical models (Nozawa et al. 2003; Bianchi & Schneider
2007; Cherchneﬀ & Dwek 2010) predict production of silica
in SN ejecta, and laboratory measurement (Haenecour et al.
2013) discovered two SiO2 grains that are characterized by
and originated from Type II SN ejecta.

4.2 Exploring other SED ﬁtting models

Here we compare the eﬀect of assuming diﬀerent grain prop-
erties and grain compositions. The results from all the mod-
els tested in this Section are listed in Table 4, along with the
grain compositions assumed, and the resultant dust temper-
atures and masses. Some of the model ﬁts and their residuals
are shown in Figures 18 and 20. The 21µm and 11µm dust
features are well produced by the CDE grain model of silica
and Silicon carbide (SiC), respectively. As well as the dust
features and compositions required to ﬁt the IRS spectrum
of the SNR, we require a population of colder dust grains to
explain the ﬂuxes at wavelengths > 70 µm (Section 4).

In Model A1, the ﬁt is produced with MgSiO3 as a warm
dust component, Al2O3 as a cold dust componen and with
SiO2 to reproduce the 21µm feature. We ﬁt the same Model
A1 to the spectrum of Cas A. The ﬁt shown in Figure 17
yielded a dust mass of 0.06 M(cid:12), a 60% higher dust mass
than that from Model B (see Table 1) by Rho et al. (2008).

Figure 18. Spectral energy distribution of G54.1+0.3 superposed
on the dust ﬁt of a warm dust component made of MgSiO3, with
cold dust of Mg2SiO4 (Top: Model A2) and of Mg2.3SiO4 using its
Qa b s at 30 K (Bottom: model A2F1), respectively. Silicate dust
using a temperature-dependent (30 K) Qa b s produced a smaller
dust mass (see Table 4).

Further work can explore the dust mass using SiO2 and also
including the long-wavelength band Herschel data. In Model
A2, we change the cool dust composition in Model A1 from
Al2O3 to Mg2SiO4 and the warm dust from Mg2SiO4 to
MgSiO3 (see Table 4). The ﬁt is poorer and generated a
higher dust mass (0.9 M(cid:12)). Next Model A3 uses MgSiO3
(59 K) and Al2O3 (30 K) instead of Mg2SiO4 (59 K) and
Al2O3 (40 K) resulting in a dust mass of 0.35 M(cid:12). Again this
is a poorer ﬁt, with residuals at 40-100µm and 300-500µm.
Next we checked the eﬀect of using temperature de-
pendent dust absorption properties. Dupac et al. (2003) ob-
served large variations of the spectral index (β ∼ 0.8 − 2.4)
for dust with a wide range of temperatures (11 to 80 K),
and suggested that there is an intrinsic dependence of the
dust spectral index on the temperature (T-β anticorrela-
tion). The reasons can be the change in grain sizes, chemi-
cal composition of the grains in diﬀerent environments and
due to quantum processes. Paradis et al. (2011) also showed
the ﬂattening of the observed dust SED at far IR wave-
lengths using DIRBE, Archeops and WMAP, this results in

wavelength depending on the micro structure of the ma-
terials. For wavelengths shorter than ∼ 500 µm the spec-
tral index is in the range 1.6-2.3 whereas at longer wave-
lengths it changes and its value may be outside this range.
To determine if grains with temperature-dependent absorp-
tion properties could ﬁt the SED of G54.1+0.3, we used two
datasets for grain compositions closest to Mg2SiO4: one cor-
responds to glassy grains Mg1.9SiO3.9 (“X35” sample) and
the other corresponds to a more porous sample of composi-
tion Mg2.3SiO4 (with a slight Mg excess, “F1” sample). The
spectra of these two analogues are diﬀerent because the ana-
logues diﬀers in terms of structure at micro- (nano-) meter
scale, of porosity, of chemical composition and homogene-
ity at small scale. Figure 19 shows the optical constants of
these materials. The Qabs depart from β=2 at > 200µm as
shown in Figure 19. When Qabs decreases at low temper-
ature, the emissivity is ﬂatter, and the ﬂux is higher than
expected with β = 2. Models A2F1 and A2X35 therefore in-
clude Mg2.3SiO4 and Mg1.9SiO3.9 at a temperature of 30 K
instead of Mg2SiO4. Since Mg2SiO4 has lower Qabs at long
wavelengths, this could result in a higher dust mass for the
SNR. The ﬁts for these models (Table 4, Figure 18) were
not as good as the model with cold dust grains of Mg2SiO4
(Model A2) or Al2O3 (Model A1). We note that Qabs of
Mg2.3SiO4 and Mg1.9SiO3.9 show a factor of a few higher
than that of Mg2SiO4 above 40 µm; this likely resulted in
the poorer ﬁt to the data.

Although theoretical models of dust formation in SNe
(Nozawa et al. 2003; Todini & Ferrara 2001) predicted that
FeS grains are produced in the ejecta, we do not detect the
sharp 34µm dust feature in the spectra of G54.1+0.3 and
Cas A. We therefore try models where we replace FeS with
carbon dust (with featureless absorption coeﬃcient). First
we replace the cold dust with carbon in Model A4. This
provides one of the best ﬁts to the observed data (∆ χ2 =
3.7) with a total dust mass of 0.26 M(cid:12). We also reﬁt Models
A1, A2 and A3 using carbon dust as the warm component
(Models B1, B2, and B3 - Table 4) but ﬁnd that the quality
of the ﬁts are slightly worse than those using FeS (Figure 20).
In order to reduce the relatively large residuals at
medium or long wavelengths, we also included additional
warm or cold dust components using MgSiO3 or Al2O3,
but the ﬁts were not improved. We have ﬁtted with SiO2
grains as a cool dust component and the ﬁt produced a large
amount of dust of sim2.75 M(cid:12) (see Table 4). However, this
dust mass of SiO2 is a factor of two larger than the SiO2 dust
mass constraints predicted by nuclear synthesis and dust
formation models (Nozawa et al. 2003; Cherchneﬀ & Dwek
2010; Sukhbold et al. 2016; Temim et al. 2017); the predicted
maximum SiO2 dust is about 1.3 M(cid:12) for the largest possible
progenitor mass of 35 M(cid:12). Thus, this model is a non-physical
model and we excluded this model from the total dust mass
estimates. We attempted to ﬁt the spectra with two com-
ponents of cool dust with the ﬁrst component being SiO2,
and the second component being Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, or car-
bon dust, but the new ﬁttings were not successful; the ﬁts
were either statistically insigniﬁcant when we accounted for
the errors, or the reduced χ2 were too large. This is likely
due to lack of far-IR data points.

Table 4 shows a summary of dust spectral ﬁtting. The
individual ﬁt includes 6 components: hot and warm silica
components (with temperature ranges of 200-2700 K and 70-
115 K), Silicon carbide, two warm dust components (with
temperature ranges of 150-210 K and 54-60 K), and a cool
dust component (with a temperature range of 27-44 K). We
also included grains of SiO2 at high temperature (300 K)
to account for the emission feature around 9.0µm, which
was added to mimic IR emission from stochastic heating (eg
Lagage et al. 1996; Rho et al. 2008).

What did heat those dust grains? For the case of Cas
A, the dominant heating source is a reverse shock. Since the
dust is heated in young SNRs by the reverse shock, it was
easier to be detected than that in SNe where a reverse shock
has not yet passed SN ejecta (see Section 5.2 for details).
When the gas temperature reaches about 1200 K that was
∼400 days after the SN explosion, dust forms and continues
to cool down for 3-5 years, the exact time scale and tem-
perature depending on the grain composition (see Nozawa
et al. 2003). The dust in SNe is too cool to be detected or
it is hard to distinguish the cool dust in SN ejecta from SN
light echoes.

Koo et al. (2008) showed a few OB stars in the ﬁeld
of the SNR G54.1+0.3. Temim et al. (2010, 2017) and Kim
et al. (2013) suggested that they belong to the same Stel-
lar Cluster as the progenitor of the SNR G54.1+0.3. Using
near-IR spectroscopic observations, Kim et al. (2013) showed
that the stars are O9 (17Msun) and a few early B stars, and
suggested the progenitor of G54.1+0.3 to be Type IIP with
a mass range of 8-20 M(cid:12) (<< 35M(cid:12)), so the progenitor is

likely not a Wolf-Rayet star. Later O and early B type stars
have temperatures of 37,000 K to 15,000 K. Herschel obser-
vations of such stars show a dust temperature of ∼ 60-80K,
which contribute a small amount of the dust mass. There-
fore, the OB stars may be the source of the warm dust tem-
perature, but it is not clear if they are the heating source
of the cold temperature component of the dust (20-40K) in
the SNR. The analogy of G54.1+0.3 to the Crab Nebula dis-
cussed below may suggest that OB stars alone may not be
unique heating sources of the dust in G54.1+0.3, although
the possibility cannot be ruled out with current evidence.

For the Crab-like SNRs, the heating source is diﬀerent
because the evidence of forward shock is unclear and thus
the reverse shock may have not developed (Hester 2008).
Since G54.1+0.3 is a Crab-like SNR, we examined the heat-
ing mechanism of the Crab Nebula. The pulsar wind nebula
of the Crab Nebula emits synchrotron radiation, where elec-
trons are spinning around the magnetic ﬁeld. The existence
of this shock driven by the synchrotron nebula is recognized
by Rayleigh-Taylor ﬁngers (Sankrit et al. 1998) who esti-
mate a shock velocity of 230 km s−1, labeling the shock as
nonradiative. Numerical simulations of the expansion of the
Crab Nebula invariably identify these observed arcs with
material from a surrounding freely expanding remnant that
has been compressed by the synchrotron-driven shock (Jun
1998; Bucciantini et al. 2004). The wind shock thermalizes
ﬂow energy, accelerating electrons and positrons to energies
as high as ∼104 TeV.

The dominant heating source for the dust in the Crab
Nebula is known to be synchrotron radiation (i.e. nonther-
nal radiation ﬁeld) in the pulsar wind nebula that depends
on the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation (Davidson
1973; Dwek & Werner 1981; Dwek & Smith 1996; Temim
& Dwek 2013). Grains are also heated by collisions between
the electrons and the gas in the ﬁlaments, but this heat-
ing is suggested to be insigniﬁcant in the Crab-like SNRs
(Hester 2008; Dwek & Werner 1981; Temim & Dwek 2013;
Temim et al. 2012). We are suggesting the heating source of
G54.1+0.3 is similar to that of the Crab Nebula, dominant
heating being photoionization from synchrotron emission,
synchrotron-driven shock and possible contribution from
collisional heating. Our results do not support the claim
that the stellar members of the SN progenitor’s cluster in
G54.1+0.3 are the primary heating sources for the SN dust
by Temim et al. (2017) because we do not detect excess of
the temperature and dust mass at the position of stars (see
Figure 14). The blob with the high temperature on the west-
ern shell (Figure 14a) coincides with the bright blob on the
western shell in the 24µm image and does not coincide with
stars in the cluster. The heating source of G54.1+0.3, which
is responsible for the warm and cool grains we observe, is
likely photoionization from the synchrotron emission in the
G54.1+0.3’s pulsar wind nebula.

recognized by their highly unusual isotopic compositions rel-
ative to all other materials (e.g. Zinner 2013). Silicon carbide
(SiC) is the best-studied type of presolar grain and has been
suggested to be formed in supernovae. Another well-known
pre-solar grain is corundum (Al2O3), low-density graphite
(e.g. carbon grains), amorphous silicates, forsterite and en-

statite, and corundum (Messenger et al. 2006). Some isotopic
anomalies of heavy elements, especially 16O-enrichments, in
meteorites have been attributed to the dust that had con-
densed deep within expanding supernovae (Clayton & Nit-
tler 2004). The existence of isotopic anomalies in a major
element within meteoritic solids provided a decade of moti-

vation for the search for supernova stardust. Meteoritic stud-
ies have shown that some types of presolar grains condense
in the dense, warm stellar winds of evolved stars but other
types of presolar grains (such as SiC-X grains) condenses in
supernova explosions (Clayton & Nittler 2004). Mantles on
grains in molecular clouds are vaporized as stars form in the
clouds. A small fraction of dust survives planet formation
without alteration, protected inside asteroids.

We show that 10-13µm dust feature observed in
G54.1+0.3 and Cas A are attributed to Silicon carbide us-
ing two methods. We showed that spectral ﬁtting with the
CDE model of SiC can reproduce the 11µm dust feature
again both for G54.1+0.3 and Cas A (see Figures 16, 17, 18
and 20). We suggest that SiC is responsible for the broad
dust bump between 10-13µm whereas the PAH emission is
responsible for the features at 11.0, 11.2 and 12.7µm (see
Section 3.2.3).

New presolar phases, such as SiO2 have been identiﬁed
with the Auger spectroscopy to characterize the elemental
compositions of pre-solar silicate and oxide grains (Nguyen
et al. 2010). They all exhibit enrichments in 17O relative to
solar, indicating origins in the envelopes of AGB stars (Mes-
senger et al. 2006). We showed that the 21µm dust feature
in G54.1+0.3 and Cas A can be reproduced with the CDE
model of amorphous silica (SiO2). Theoretical models by
Nozawa et al. (2003) predicted silica dust grains in super-
nova ejecta as well as other silicate dust such as enstatite
(MgSiO3) and forsterite (Mg2SiO4) as our spectral ﬁtting
also supports. Following Schneider et al. (2004), Bianchi &
Schneider (2007) have added the formation of SiO2 grains.
We presented the ﬁrst results of ﬁtting using SiO2 to repro-
duce the 21µm dust feature in Cas A in conference proceed-
ing (Rho et al. 2009a). Inspired from that, Haenecour et al.
(2013) searched SiO2 from the primitive carbonaceous chon-
drites LaPaZ 031117 and Grove Mountains 021710 from me-
teorites, and they discovered two SiO2 grains that are char-
acterized by moderate enrichments in 18O relative to solar
and originated in Type II supernova ejecta. This proves that
SiO2 is also pre-solar grains which are originated from super-
novae. The discovery of these two silica grains in laboratory
provides support that the silica dust which re-produces the
21µm dust feature in the young SNR G54.1+0.3 and Cas
A. Arendt et al. (2014) suggested that magnesium silicates
(particularly Mg0.7SiO2.7 have peaks that are in roughly the
right locations, but their shapes are not a good match to the
IRS data of Cas A, although two-composition ﬁts help to im-
prove the ﬁts. This particular silicates are not predicted by
theoretical models of dust in SN ejecta and our SiO2 pro-
duces a better ﬁt than that. Note that our Qabs of SiO2 is
diﬀerent from that in Arendt et al. (2014).

The dust mass of silica depends on the progenitor mass,
and diﬀerent theoretical models predict diﬀerent amounts of
dust mass. The progenitor of G54.1+0.3 has a large range
between 15-35 M(cid:12) (see Table 5). The observed SiO2 dust
masses range from 10−5 to 2×10−3 M(cid:12). Theoretical models
(Nozawa et al. 2003) predicted that for the unmixed case
the dust mass of SiO2 is 0.02 - 0.2 M(cid:12) ( 5% - 12% of the
total dust mass), and for mixed case the dust mass of SiO2
is 0.6 - 1.3 M(cid:12) (70% - 50% of the total mass). The other
dominant dust mass is predicted to be from Mg2SiO4. Cher-
chneﬀ & Dwek (2010) predicted that the dust mass of SiO2
is 67% (about 0.1 M(cid:12)) of the total dust mass for the no

depletion case, while very small percent of SiO2 is formed
for the Mg/Fe depleted case. Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2013)
suggest a small amount of SiO2, one order of 10−5 M(cid:12) as we
observed for most of our spectral models. In order to accu-
rately characterize a dozen dust species that are predicted
by the theoretical models, a higher number of far-IR data
points or far-IR spectroscopic data are required. Theoreti-
cal models of small grids in the progenitor mass and other
physical parameters that determine the dust mass will also
be helpful.

5.2 The dust mass in supernova ejecta and its

implication to the dust in the early Universe

The dust mass we estimated from G54.1+0.3 is 0.08-
0.90 M(cid:12) (see Table 4) depending on the grain composition,
which is comparable to predicted masses from theoretical
models. The dust mass estimate of G54.1+0.3 can be more
accurate than that of Cas A because of the following two
reasons; (1) the foreground ISM contribution is less obvious
than that of Cas A (Barlow et al. 2010) in far-IR emission as
shown in Figure 3, and (2) the dust destruction due to the
forward or reverse shock is less signiﬁcant because the SNR
G54.1+0.3 is a Crab-like SNR. G54.1+0.3 and Cas A have
typical foreground emission of 0.08 and 0.32 Jy (9(cid:48)(cid:48)pixel)−1
at 160µm, and 0.3 and 0.55 Jy beam−1 at 250µm, respec-
tively. The surface brightness of the foreground emission in
vicinity of G54.1+0.3 is ∼20-30 percent of the SNR bright-
ness, whereas the typical brightness of foreground emission
near Cas A is ∼90 - 115 percent of the Cas A brightness.
Most importantly, the ﬁlamentary cirrus structures continue
to be present across the SNR Cas A in the Herschel images
(see Figure 1 of Barlow et al. 2010), while such cirrus struc-
tures are not obvious toward G54.1+0.3 (see Figures 3 and
4). The statistical uncertainties of dust temperatures and
masses for each spectral ﬁtting results are given in Table 4.
The uncertainty of dust mass ranges between 7-35 percent.
Our estimated dust mass is somewhat lower (0.07-1.2
M(cid:12) after accounting for the errors) than that (1.1±0.8 M(cid:12))
obtained by Temim et al. (2017). Considering completely
independent methods, this is a reasonable agreement since
the systematic errors could be this large caused by diﬀer-
ent grain compositions, absorption coeﬃciencies used and
the ﬂux measurements of Herschel due to large background
variations.

In Table 4, the dust mass of 0.08-0.90 M(cid:12) primarily
comes from the cool dust component (>90%), and the warm
dust contributes to the dust mass less than 10% except the
case of of Fe3O4 as a cool dust (model A5 and B4). Another
noticeable conclusion is when we use Mg2SiO4 as a cool com-
ponent, the ﬁtting (Models A1 and B2) gives higher dust
masses than the other models. Bianchi & Schneider (2007)
show that large amounts (0.1 M(cid:12)) of cool dust (T ∼ 40 K)
can be present which is similar to what we observed within
a factor of 3, and for the case of olivine Mg2SiO4 as a cool
dust component we observed a large dust mass (up to 0.88
M(cid:12)).

We examined the correlation between the derived dust
mass and the ﬁtted dust temperature of the cool component.
There is an expectation that dust mass is higher when the
dust temperature is lower as the cool dust dominates its dust
mass as shown in Table 4. Gall et al. (2011) also shows this

pared to the time-scales for the formation of new dust (Jones
et al. 1994). Recent simulations by Slavin et al. (2015) shows
that the dust destruction timescales are increased by a fac-
tor of 2-6 times compared to those of Jones et al. (1996)
when accounting for the thermal history of a shocked gas
and longer silicate grain destruction timescale. Nath et al.
(2008) ﬁnd that a fraction of the dust mass (1%- 20% for
silicates and graphites) can be sputtered by reverse shocks,
the fraction varying with the size of ejecta knots, the grain
size distribution and the steepness of the density proﬁle of
the ejecta mass. Silvia et al. (2010) ﬁnd that for high ejecta
densities, the percentage of dust that survives is strongly
dependent on the relative velocity between the clump and
the reverse shock, causing up to 50% more destruction for
the highest velocity shock. The rates of dust destruction
therefore depends on the pre-shock density, progenitor mass,
shock speed and so on. At least 2-20% of dust is survived be-
hind the reverse shock (Bianchi & Schneider 2007; Micelotta
et al. 2016) where knots can be as dense as 108 cm−3 (based
on CO observations for Cas A Rho et al. 2009b, 2012b). For
G54.1+0.3, dust destruction by a forward shock may be less
critical, since the evidence of strong forward shock has not
been observed in the Crab-like SNRs (Hester 2008).

Our observations of G54.1+0.3 implies that 0.08-0.9
M(cid:12) of dust is formed in the ejecta with cool temper-
atures ranging from 27-44 K. This mass is consistent with
the predicted dust mass from the theoretical models of dust
formation in SN ejecta (Nozawa et al. 2003; Todini & Fer-
rara 2001; Bianchi & Schneider 2007). The estimated dust
mass from the G54.1+0.3 implies that SNe are a signiﬁcant
source of dust in the early Universe. Table 5 compares the
dust masses observed with Spitzer alone and a combination
of Spitzer and Herschel observations. The dust masses ob-
served with Herschel are an order of magnitude larger than
those previously measured in these remnants using Spitzer,
and are two orders of magnitude higher than those observed
in young SNe (Kotak et al. 2006; Gall et al. 2011). As with
SN1987A, Cas A and the Crab Nebula (see Table 5), we
ﬁnd that the mass of dust in the G54.1+0.3 SNR is very
diﬀerent based on SED ﬁtting with and without adding the
FIR-submm regime. Spectral ﬁtting including the long wave-
length SED in Figure 16 requires a signiﬁcant amount of dust
at lower temperatures. Thus, this work adds to the growing
evidence that core-collapse SNe are forming large quantities
of dust.

Future JWST observations of SNe will help to resolve
if the dust observed in SNe is from ejecta, dense shell from

of dust temperature versus mass for the cool dust compo-
nent for G54.1+0.3 given the compositions assumed in this
work. The dust mass is inversely proportional to the Planck
function which is a function of temperature as shown in the
equation in Section 4. The trend is observed in Figure 21
when we exclude Mg2SiO4. The dust mass depends on not
only the temperature but also the density and absorption co-
eﬃcient of the grain composition. The cold grains dominate
the dust mass as shown in Table 4. However, for some cases,
the dust mass of warm dust was higher than that of cool dust
(see the case of Model A5) where the warm dust reproduces
the large portion of continuum and has low Qabs compared
with those of other grains (see Fig. 19). The total mass of
dust we derive here for a range of grain compositions is be-
tween 0.08-0.9 M(cid:12) including temperature-dependent silicate
grains. The one exception is when we assume grains com-
posed of forsterite (Mg2SiO4) which yields a higher dust
mass than other models. Our results show that the grain
composition is also an important factor as well as the tem-
perature to determine the total dust mass (as well as the
cool dust temperature).

Whether some of the dust formed in the ejecta will sur-
vive is a major unresolved issue. The lifetimes of the major
dust materials (i.e. carbon and silicates) against the rate of
destruction by SN shock waves appear to be too short com-

stellar wind, or from light echos, and will allow us to observe
dust formation of diﬀerent types of dust from 300 - 800 days
after the explosion.

6 CONCLUSION

(i) We report the detection of far-infrared and submil-
limeter emission from the Crab-like SNR G54.1+0.3 us-
ing SHARC-II, LABOCA and Herschel observations (70-
500µm).

(ii) Using Spitzer archival IRS, IRAC, and MIPS data,
we detected a 21µm dust feature in G54.1+0.3 remarkably
similar to that seen in Cas A. As in Cas A, this 21µm dust
feature is coincident with the ejecta line emission as traced
by [Ar II]. SED ﬁtting suggests that the 21µm feature is
composed of SiO2 grains. The 21µm feature in the SNRs
G54.1+0.3 and Cas A is oﬀset by ∼1µm from the dust fea-
ture (peaking at 20.3µm) in the PPNe or carbon stars, and
neither SNR has a broad dust bump at 30µm which is seen
in the PPNe. The 21µm dust feature, therefore, seems to be
unique to Cas A and G54.1+0.3 to date.

(iii) We suggest that the 21µm dust features in G54.1+0.3
and Cas A are attributed to the presolar grains of SiO2. We
raise a possibility that the 11µm dust features may come
from the pre-solar grain of SiC with a combination of PAH
contribution.

(iv) We reveal a cold dust component (27-44 K) coinci-
dent with the SNR with a total dust mass of 0.08 − 0.9 M(cid:12)
depending on the grain composition within the ejecta. If
the FIR and submm emission is indeed dust formed in the
ejecta, this makes G54.1+0.3 one of only four SNRs where
cold dust is detected. The amount of dust mass observed
from the SNR G54.1+0.3 suggests that SNe are a signiﬁ-
cant source of dust in the early Universe.
