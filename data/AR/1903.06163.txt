Abstract We present a novel X-ray assembly of functionally related instrument blocks intended
to measure solar ﬂare and active region (AR) spectra from within the Russian instrument com-
plex KORTES, to be mounted aboard the International Space Station (ISS). SolpeX consists of
three blocks: fast-rotating multiple ﬂat crystal Bragg spectrometer, pin-hole X-ray spectral imager
and Bragg polarimeter. This combination of measuring blocks will oﬀer an opportunity to de-
tect/measure possible X-ray polarization in soft X-ray emission lines/continuum and record spectra
of solar ﬂares, in particular during their impulsive phases. Polarized Bremsstrahlung and line emis-
sion may arise from presence of directed particle beams colliding with denser regions of ﬂares. As
a result of evaporation, the X-ray spectral-components are expected to be Doppler shifted, which
will also be measured.

In this paper, we present details of the construction of three SolpeX blocks and discuss their

functionality. Delivery of KORTES with SolpeX to ISS is expected in 2020/2021.

plasmas (target) leads to the formation of transient sources with spectra extending over the entire
electromagnetic range from radio to gamma rays. Studies of X-ray ﬂare emission was and is the
most direct way to infer properties of these particle beams and thermal hot, multimillion degree
plasmas. Studying the nature of ﬂare X-ray sources is crucial for understanding the energy release
and its conversion to thermalised, turbulent and kinetic components. Accelerated particle beams,
while interacting with ambient denser plasma, release a small amount of energy in the form of
non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, expected to be polarized due to anisotropic character of interactions.
With SolpeX, we intend to detect the polarization for the ﬁrst time in the soft X-ray lines and con-
tinuum emission at ∼3 keV, which will additionally constrain the properties of electron beams by
determining the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld at the interaction region [6]. Models of interaction
predict that the harder X-ray emission, consisting solely of continuum emission, should be highly
polarized, with a polarization degree as high as 40% at 20 keV [28]. The soft X-ray emission (at
energies < 10 keV) consists of lines as well as continuum, and the line emission is also expected to be
polarized [5]. The X-rays from anisotropic interactions are expected to dominate during the early
impulsive phase of ﬂares (the ﬁrst seconds to minutes of ﬂares). The other processes contributing
to polarization, although at a lower level, and the later ﬂare phases are due to anisotropy of the
electron distribution function within thermalized sources [7] and/or backscattering of the X-rays
formed in the coronal X-ray source on lower-lying structures of solar atmosphere [10].

The importance of measuring polarization of X-ray ﬂare emission was realized from the very
beginning of the space era. The ﬁrst attempts at detecting X-ray polarization from solar ﬂares were
made using polarimeters on-board Soviet Intercosmos satellites. The early results indicated rather
high values of average polarization P = 40(±20)% [22] and 20% [23], [24] at energies ∼15 keV.
Subsequent observations with an X-ray polarimeter on board the OSO-7 satellite point to smaller
value of the polarization 10% [14]. Later studies show even smaller values of polarization often
below sensitivity threshold. The polarimeter on-board Intercosmos–11 [25] detected polarization of
few percent only at the energy ∼15 keV. Similar values of the degree of polarization were obtained
from the polarimeter placed on-board STS-3 mission. The upper limits determined in the 5–20 keV
energy range by [26] were 2.5% to 12.7%.

The most recent determinations of solar ﬂare X-ray polarization at the higher energy range were
obtained from analysis of data collected by RHESSI (NASA) and the SPR-N polarimeter on-board
the CORONAS-F satellite.

Using RHESSI data [13] found a polarization of ∼18% in the energy range 20–40 keV. The source
was an X-class solar ﬂare on July 23, 2002 at 00:35 UT (SOL2002-07-23T00:35). For the same event
and an additional X-class ﬂare (SOL2003-10-28T11:06) the polarization at levels of 21% ± 9% and
11% ± 5% were reported by [2] at much higher energies (0.2–1 MeV). [19] found for six X-class ﬂares
and one M-class ﬂare values for the polarization degree in the range between 2% and 54% at an
energy range between 100 and 350 keV.

According to [3] the SPR-N polarimeter indicated strong (>70%) polarization at energies 40–
100 keV for a ﬂare on 29 October 2003, but zero polarization for two other ﬂares (SOL2013-
10-28T11:00 and SOL2013-11-04T19:34). Using data from this same satellite Zhitnik et al. [29]
found, among 90 analyzed ﬂares, one event (X10 class ﬂare SOL2003-10-29T20:37) which showed
a signiﬁcant polarization degree exceeding 70% at energies 40–100 keV and about 50% at lower
energies (20–40 keV). For other 25 events, the upper limits for the polarization were estimated to
be between 8% and 40%.

All these X-ray polarization determinations were obtained using a Compton scattering technique.
For polarized radiation, the azimuthal distribution of the scattered photons is no longer isotropic,

but is related to the polarization vector of the incident photons. The energy resolution of the
Compton polarimeters mentioned was rather coarse. Also, a low signal-to-noise ratio did not allow
high-time-resolution observations.

In view of rather equivocal results obtained so far, we devised a diﬀerent technique of polarization
detection with the aim of studying the polarization in a softer X-ray band, which relies on the
selective properties of Bragg reﬂection (close to the Brewster angle), on the orientation of the
polarization vector relative to the crystal plane (see Fig. 14).

In the following, we describe in detail the construction of the three blocks comprising SolpeX,

designed to observe solar soft X-ray emission i.e.:

– PHI – a simple Pin-Hole soft X-ray Imager-spectrophotometer using detector with moderate
spatial (∼20 arcsec), spectral (FWHM of Fe line at 6.4 keV is 0.44 keV, 0.37 keV for Cu line at
8.05 keV and 0.65 keV for Mo line at 17.48 keV) and high time resolution (1/8 s)

– B-POL the 3.9 Å–4.15 Å spectrometer and polarimeter (Bragg POLarimeter) with a low 1-2%

linear polarization detection threshold.

– RDS – a fast Rotating Drum X-ray Spectrometer with high time resolution (0.1 s)

In Fig. 1a, we show the location of the units within the KORTES instrument (as of February
2018). The RDS unit is placed close to the radiator, which is used by the entire instrument. The B-
POL polarimeter is placed in the rear section of KORTES. This location is imposed by functionality,
as the polarimeter’s CMOS detectors will be cooled down to below -20◦C using the rotating radiator
attached to the rotating axis (which will also act as a heat sink). On the side of the polarimeter,
a square CMOS detector is attached on which the X-ray image of the Sun from the pin-hole is
projected. The pin-hole itself is mounted on the front-plane of KORTES. The engineering models
of B-POL and RDS are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c respectively.

A general diagram of the SolpeX instrument electronics indicating the main components is
shown in Fig. 2. The B-POL block is treated as the master unit and has Telemetry/Telecommand
(TM/TC) serial interfaces for direct connection to KORTES. In addition, the Pulse Per Second

(PPS) signal from KORTES is distributed to the other SolpeX modules. Each of them synchronizes
its internal, precise clocks with this signal, thus maintaining mutual time synchronization without
the need to correct the clocks during operation. In order to perform these control functions of the
instrument and to handle the incoming data, the polarimeter is equipped with a dedicated FPGA
ProASIC3 chip as well as 128 GB of Flash memory to buﬀer the data ﬂow. Also noteworthy is
the fact that the detector part of the polarimeter electronics is located on the rotating part of the
device. For this reason, we have used a slip ring to provide an electrical connection for the power
supply and data transmission for this part of the instrument. Details of the other components of
the electronic blocks are described in the following sections.

From the electronics perspective, we also distinguish an additional block, the Power Supply
Unit (PSU), common for the three SolpeX blocks. Based on VPT’s series of high reliability DC/DC
converters, it will produce the power required for the measurement blocks from the unregulated
28 V KORTES power bus.

KORTES itself is to be placed on the solar pointing platform attached to the Russian Nauka
module on ISS. The pointing platform of Nauka is guided towards the center of the solar disk. The
illumination conditions at the placement of KORTES are not ideal for making solar observations
as the complicated mechanical structure of ISS causes substantial vignetting. Only 10–12 min of
uninterrupted illumination is available for every ISS orbit, so catching the impulsive phase of a ﬂare
will need some luck. Estimates indicate that by 2021 the current solar minimum will have ended
and that we might expect to observe the impulsive phases of ∼40 C-class ﬂares, 5 M-class ﬂares and
a single X-class ﬂare during the ﬁrst year of instrument operations. The KORTES instrument will
be delivered to ISS by a cargo ship and then ﬁxed to the Nauka module by cosmonauts. After the
mission is completed, the instrument will return to the ground for post-ﬂight checks. The data from
the instrument will be transmitted on-line to the recorder inside ISS using KORTES telemetry, so
practically unlimited storage is available on hard disk. The solar X-ray image formed on CMOS
will be displayed for the cosmonauts on board to follow solar activity in real time. A selected
part of the information will be beamed down in real time, allowing prompt analysis leading to ﬂight
software corrections and upgrades. The instrument can be operated round the clock, also during the
night-portions of the orbit for the calibration purposes or measurements of non-solar astrophysical
sources. Below we describe the three blocks of SolpeX in more detail.

2 Pin-Hole soft X-ray Imager-spectrophotometer — PHI

Proper operation of the RDS and B-POL requires timely information on any solar X-ray activity
that might be occurring on the solar disc. Such information can be obtained from a simple pin-
hole telescope/imager/spectrometer equipped with thermal ﬁlter transmitting solar soft X-rays
and rejecting solar thermal/optical/EUV emission. Such a ﬁlter made of aluminized polyimide will
transmit in the range E>0.35 keV, a similar spectral range to this covered by XRT Ti-poly ﬁlter on
Hinode [9]. The image of the X-ray solar disk is formed behind the pin-hole on the square 2k×2k
CMOS (Gpixel Inc.). The readout time of the full frame can be between 1/48 s and 1/8 s. Most of
the time the PHI will operate with the time resolution of 1/8 s.

In Fig. 3b simulated X-ray images are shown as will be projected on the CMOS for four activity
scenarios: no active regions visible, single AR present, ﬂare and AR present on separate locations
on the disk and two ARs with two ﬂares in progress. This images were obtained by processing real
XRT Ti-poly images. It is seen that limb brightening is clearly present in every case. The shape of

thickness. This diameter of the pin-hole is adequate to achieve suﬃcient X-ray photon statistics.
The pin-hole is covered by ∼15 µm thick thermal ﬁlter as seen from the Sun direction. The X-ray
image is projected on the CMOS. With the pin-hole - CMOS distance of 578 mm, the projected
diameter of the solar disc corresponds to ∼215 detector pixels. b) Simulated images of X-ray Sun

projected on the pin-hole camera CMOS. The on-board processing by the PHI electronics “ﬁnds”

and their intensities.

the limb-brightened crescents allow (after on-board processing) for the determination of the disk
edge and its centre in the CMOS coordinate system (see the limb position plotted as a circle in
Fig. 3b). This important information is necessary to allow co-alignment with other images obtained
by KORTES and can be used to analyse the accuracy of the ﬁne solar pointing system of the Nauka
module.

Using appropriate algorithms, actual positions of ARs and their sizes and orientation (from 2D
Gaussian ﬁts) will be determined as well as the total X-ray base-projected brightness for every
resolved AR. The dispersion direction of the RDS crystal is aligned with the CMOS base, therefore
the X-ray brightness shape along the dispersion will be recorded frequently and subsequently used
to deconvolve the real spectral shapes from those observed by RDS (see Chapter 3).

Fig. 4: Histogram of CMOS energy spectrum taken in laboratory conditions. The Gpixel Inc. CMOS
(GSENSE400 BSI) recorded the X-rays reﬂected from multi-metal foil system consisted of Ti, Fe,
Cu and Mo. The foils were illuminated by the X-ray lamp set at 35 keV voltage. Individual peaks due
to characteristic Kα emission are easily discernible. The ambient temperature during measurements
was 20◦C. To avoid pileup the measurements were taken 120 times with 8 ms of single exposition.
The CMOS matrix was shielded from the direct illumination coming from the X-ray lamp itself. A
readout and control system for this CMOS readout was based on FPGA Spartan 6 XCFSLX9. The
CMOS readout time (see the text) allowed for a single photon/pixel regime. Such a mode will be
routine for B-POL and most of PHI observing time except for the strongest ﬂares (X-class).

The CMOS to be used in B-POL and PHI is characterized by a good energy resolution, provided
single X-ray photons strike on the pixel. The energy resolution of CMOS pixel is illustrated in Fig. 4.
With the frame read-out time 1/8 s, a single photon/pixel scenario will take place most of the time,
except for the most powerful ﬂares, when double strikes/pixel are expected. Amplitude analysis of
the signal from individual CMOS pixels will be used to discern solar X-ray photons from those due
to secondary ﬂuorescence or energetic particles. The brightness proﬁle can be created for selected
energies, that are the representative for individual spectral bands.

The X-ray corona projected on to the CMOS extends to ∼2.5 solar radii in both directions. A
large portion of CMOS, away from the solar disk will not be illuminated by solar X-rays, allowing
the changes of the orbital background and possible secondary X-rays formed within KORTES to be
studied. A part of secondary X-ray contribution arising in the instrument due to energetic particle
environment will be removed by covering the CMOS with a very thin plastic ﬁlter. This ﬁlter will
prevent possible internal EUV and optical leaks to interfere with the solar X-ray image projected

by a pin-hole. The background signal from CMOS will be used to estimate particle interference for
the identical CMOS used in B-POL to record the X-ray spectra.

From images similar to that shown in Fig. 3b (to be collected every 1/8 s) the soft X-ray light
curves of individual active regions will be analyzed in real-time by the on-board software in order
to detect and locate ARs and ﬂares on the disc. A 2D Gaussian elliptical proﬁle will be ﬁtted to
individual stronger brightenings after collecting enough statistics and their central positions will be
determined. Those positions will be passed to the KORTES and B-POL internal pointing system
in order to lock the orientation of the polarimeter rotation axis on selected targets.

The data obtained from the PHI, in particular the X-ray intensities from the total CMOS, back-
ground corrected signal and on-board detected individual AR(s) ﬂuxes, will be used to determine
the state of the X-ray corona, i.e. corresponding ﬂuxes in at least two energy bands. The signal-
to-noise ratios, as obtained from images in these two bands, will allow the determination of the
average coronal temperatures (using a ﬁlter ratio technique) and corresponding average emission
measures (from the X-ray ﬂux)[8]. These data will also enable ﬂuxes in the standard GOES X-ray
bands 0.5–4 Å and 1–8 Å to be imitated on-board.

The total level and distribution of the emission on the disk will be used to deﬁne and classify

the status of solar momentary activity into three classes:

– “Quiet” - only limb brightening + bright points contribution are present;
– AR1 - one non-ﬂaring AR detected by the algorithm (AR2, AR3 etc. if more AR detected);
– FL1 - one ﬂare in progress (or FL2, as sometimes two ﬂares may happen at the same time in

diﬀerent ARs). AR1 + FL1 would mean one non-ﬂaring and separate ﬂaring AR present.

The history (ﬂux levels from ﬁve previous time periods) of total X-ray signal recorded for
individual components (total solar ﬂuxes and ﬂuxes in individual ARs - if present) will be used
to assign “phase” of active Sun. This will be done by an on-board computer algorithm analysing
the time dependences from these ﬁve preceding time points. If the ﬂuxes are rising fast enough,
the ﬂare start is ﬁxed and the rise phase is ﬂagged; if maximum is reached, the ﬂare maximum
time is ﬁxed. For monotonically decreasing ﬂuxes the ﬂare decay is ﬂagged. The algorithm makes
allowance for possible statistical ﬂuctuations of the signal and works for the total X-ray signal from
the Sun (pair of ﬂuxes in two energy bands) as well as for individual ARs. If a ﬂare is detected
in particular position, the algorithm identiﬁes the location of the centroid of the ﬂaring AR and
passes this information to the B-POL (and other KORTES blocks) in order to change the operation
modes and repoint the B-POL rotation axis to lock on the ﬂaring region.

3 The Rotating Drum Spectrometer

The fast-Rotating Drum X-ray Spectrometer (RDS) will allow us to investigate possible very fast
changes in solar spectra during impulsive phases of ﬂares. The RDS is located close to the front
panel of KORTES with its detectors connected to the radiators with eﬃcient active cooling pipes
(see Fig. 5a). It will allow the creation of an atlas of contiguous solar spectra in the entire soft X-ray
range between 0.4 Å and 23 Å for various plasma temperatures. Based on such spectral atlas, it will
be possible to study distribution of diﬀerential emission measure for various plasma conditions and
from line-to-continuum ratios to determine absolute abundances of elements from oxygen to iron.
As will be discussed later, the RDS instrument is capable to measure emission lines and (uniquely)
the X-ray continuum. A special arrangement of crystals facing each other on the opposite sites of
the rotating drum will allow precise line Doppler shifts in a way similar to those incorporated in the

Fig. 5: a) RDS measurement block with the active cooling pipe system in grey b) The RDS aperture
ﬁlter consists of the two entrance windows. Filters limits UV, visible, and IR radiation from reaching
the inside of KORTES, while not overly attenuating X-rays in the range from 0.4 to 23 keV. The
transmission of the ﬁlter in this spectral range is approximately 75% or better. The ﬁlters are
made of very thin polycarbonate (Lexan) 2000 Å foils coated on both sides with 0.12 µm (1200 Å)
of aluminium. The polycarbonate window is supported by Kevlar mesh where the thickness of the
thread is 30 µm. Filter dimensions are 38×15 mm.

Diogeness instrument [15]. The novelty of the approach incorporated in RDS to obtain the X-ray
spectra is its possible very fast scanning - 10 drum turns per second. With such frequent rotations,
the Bragg-reﬂected spectrum would normally be of low statistical quality (see Fig. 11), but it will
be possible to built-up count statistics in time by assigning every recorded photon position to
respective wavelength.

This will be done by using the exact timing information on the photon arrival time on the
Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD). In RDS, we use four such state-of-the-art devices, in which the
detection time can be established with an accuracy of ∼1 µs. In one microsecond, the drum with
all the crystals will rotate by ∼10 arcsec only, so the line wavelength uncertainty corresponding to
such a small time interval (respective change in the incidence angle) is less than the line width
and therefore can be neglected. In relation with, the wavelength can be assigned to every photon
detected with a high accuracy. This time-rotation angle-wavelength ﬁxed relation will allow to build
statistically signiﬁcant spectra by summing photons arriving at the speciﬁed wavelength intervals
in order to build enough statistics.

As shown in Fig. 6, the ﬂat mono-crystals are attached to an octagonal drum rotating at high
rate or in a slow rocking mode. The crystal mount geometry is selected such that for most of
time, the solar X-rays illuminate a pair of the rotating crystals, from which the Bragg-reﬂected
photons are recorded by two pairs of SDD detectors. In time, every detector records spectra at
a slightly diﬀerent Bragg angle. The respective crystal incidence angles can easily be determined

are ﬁxed to the rotating (10 rps) or rocking drum. Bragg reﬂected spectra are recorded by four SDD
detectors. For every full rotation each of the eight crystals illuminate every of the four detectors
over a short time interval.

and converted to corresponding incoming photon wavelengths (or equivalent energies) by using a
calibrated rotation angle readout system. In the front panel of the instrument the two apertures
are covered by corresponding energy assigned ﬁlters (see Fig. 5b) that block solar thermal, optical
and EUV radiation.

The symmetric location of detectors on both sides of the rotating drum (with respect to the

direction towards the Sun) represents the conﬁguration fulﬁlling tasks of a “Dopplerometer” [21].

In the RDS we use eight ﬂat crystals, two of them identical (see Table 1 for details). For each
crystal two spectral wavebands are given. The ﬁrst band is observed by the “front” pair of detectors
(those closer to the Sun). The second waveband is observed by the rear detectors’ pair. Two identical
crystals of Si 111 are placed in the “classical” Dopplerometer conﬁguration. With all selected rotating
crystals a wide continuous spectral range extending from 0.4 Å to 22.8 Å will be covered in 0.1 s.
This will allow us to determine spectral line ﬂuxes and Doppler shifts for many abundant elements
(from oxygen to iron) emitted from ﬂaring plasma with temperatures between 1 MK and 50 MK.
These data will assist the measurements of spectra made using the B-POL unit.

The selection of detectors for RDS experiment was deﬁned by scientiﬁc requirements such as
desired wavelength range, suitable active area and the fast readout. Since the spatial resolution was
not an option, the Si-PIN detector and SDD were considered. We have chosen the SDD because of

its better performance as compared with the Si-PIN of the same area. An excellent energy resolution
is achieved due to very low detector capacitance of SDDs. Although Bragg reﬂection is the primary
technique for deﬁning the photon energies, we use also direct energy measurement as is possible
with SDD as complementary information. This will allow detecting higher orders of Bragg reﬂections
or rejecting ﬂuorescent/background counts. Detector energy resolution is important, although not
critical in this respect.

Selected detectors for RDS experiment are listed in Table 2. These modules produced by
KETEK, GmbH contain SDD chip with the JFET, feedback capacitor, reset diode, thermistor
and thermoelectric cooler (TEC) integrated in hermetic TO-8 package [https://www.ketek.net/].
Both modules H50 and H18LE have a chip thickness of 450 µm and active area limited by internal
multilayer collimator. Larger modules are also available, but with thicker Be windows. Selection of
H50 is a trade-oﬀ between active area and Be window thickness which determine the low energy cut-
oﬀ. The 12.5 µm Be window has a transmission of ∼0.25 for 1 keV photons. This gives a reasonable
sensitivity for most of energy ranges listed in Table 1. Energy ranges obtained from KAP crystal
extend down to ∼0.5 keV, thus a single H18LE module with polymer AP3.3 window is employed
to cover the KAP energy ranges (see Fig. 9). Theoretical transmission curve for AP3.3 window has
been calculated based on [17].

The results of laboratory tests of H50 and H18LE detectors are shown in Fig. 7. The measure-
ments were taken using 55Fe source placed at close distance of ∼2 mm in front of detector window.
Thin Al foil has been put between the source and the window to obtain additional Al Kα line
at 1.49 keV. As a readout system Digital Pulse Processor (DPP) with trapezoidal shaping was
used. Detailed information on measurements are gathered in Table 3. Energy threshold was set to
∼0.6 keV. Both spectra contain clear Al Kα, Mn Kα and Kβ peaks as well as Mn escape peaks at
4.16 and 4.75 keV. An additional line at 1.74 keV (Si Kα) for H18LE can also be seen, most likely
due to ﬂuorescence from the support grid of the entrance window. All counts above Mn Kβ are due
to pile-up with clear peaks at twice the Mn Kα and sum of Mn Kα and Kβ energies. Intensities
of pile-up counts are diﬀerent for H50 and H18LE because of diﬀerent count rates between the

12

measurements. The lower count rate in case of H18LE was due to a smaller active area as well as
lower overall transmission of the AP3.3 window. To compensate for the lower count rate, H18LE
spectra integration time was twice as long in the example shown. The energy resolution obtained
was 147 eV FWHM at 5.9 keV for both detectors.

To operate the SDD, several subsystems are necessary as shown in Fig. 8. Each detector is
connected to the individual electronics block. SDD achieves the best performance when operated
at temperatures below -20◦C, thus the built-in TEC will be used for active cooling. The TEC is
supplied by a dedicated DC/DC converter with the power controlled by the FPGA logic. On the
other hand, the detector mounts are connected to the KORTES radiator through active heat pipes
(as shown in Fig. 5a) to radiate the heat from the hot side of the TEC. Detector temperatures
will be monitored by the thermistor mounted close to the SDD chip on the cool side of the TEC.
Temperature monitor circuitry converts the thermistor resistance to digital values. The look-up
table in FPGA provides the measured temperature on a centigrade scale. This allows for automatic
close-loop temperature stabilization at the requested level.

The other DC/DC converter provides High Voltage (HV) of -130 V. This voltage is required to

bias the SDD ring electrodes and back contact through a voltage divider and ﬁltering circuitry.

The Charge Sensitive Preampliﬁer (CSP) converts a charge induced due to photo-electric eﬀect
into voltage pulse. The CSP is a “reset type”, thus the output is a ramp signal consisting of small
steps of several mV. Each step corresponds to interaction of X-ray photon with the detector. The
step amplitude is proportional to the energy deposited by the absorbed photon. CSP uses SDD
integrated JFET as a ﬁrst stage of the ampliﬁer and feedback capacitor. CSP contains also dedicated
reset circuitry to discharge the feedback capacitor (output ramp reset).

The ramp output is fed to signal conditioning circuitry with a high pass ﬁlter converting the
voltage steps to exponential pulses. Such a signal is then digitized by 12-bit ADC at sampling
rate of 50 MS/s. Next the detector signal is processed by DPP implemented in FPGA to extract
desired information. Unlike the commercially available DPPs which oﬀer great ﬂexibility, the RDS
design is unique and instrument-speciﬁc. The functionality is tailored for RDS requirements and
the parameters such as peaking time, energy range and others are ﬁxed while a stronger eﬀort was
taken to improve the system reliability and stability.

The information extracted from the detector signal are photon arrival time and energy. The
arrival time is a key data while the energy is an auxiliary one. FPGA core contains a precise time
counter with 1 µs step. Each detected photon is put to telemetry buﬀer as a separate data packet
with a time stamp taken from the microsecond counter. The same time stamps are assigned to other
data packets with current drum position measured once every ∼96 µs time interval. In this way one
can determine an exact drum position at the moment of photon registration. Photon energy from
direct detector measurement is used for event validation (which must be consistent with expected
energy due to Bragg reﬂection at a given drum position). This method allows for detecting higher
orders of Bragg reﬂection, ﬂuorescent counts from the crystals or estimating background counts
between eﬀective drum position ranges.

RDS does not use a microprocessor, neither separate IC nor FPGA soft processor. Since the
IDPU (inside B-POL) is common for all SolpeX blocks, RDS has only dedicated state machines
implemented in FPGA to handle telemetry packets generation, command execution and communi-
cation with IDPU through a serial link using Low Voltage Diﬀerential Signaling (LVDS) physical
interface.

The rotating drum is actuated by a stepper motor with 200 steps per revolution. Moreover, the
motor driver allows for microstepping control with 32 microsteps/step. The RDS can operate in
two modes:

– Rotating mode (default) - the drum is rotated continuously (left or right direction). Although
the motor speed can be adjusted in wide range, the ﬁxed speed of 10 RPS has been chosen as
optimal in terms of motor eﬃciency and rotation stability. Thanks to a moment of inertia of
the rotating drum, the torque ripple is reduced to marginal level and thus the rotation angular
velocity is considered as constant. Since the full revolution lasts 0.1 s, this is the basic time

interval for spectra integration. However, even for strong ﬂares, much longer time interval is
required to collect a good count statistics.

– Rocking mode (on demand) - the drum is rotated forth and back within speciﬁed range of
angles for narrow-wavelength band scans. The motor is driven in microstepping mode yielding a
6400 discrete drum angles per revolution (i.e. 202.5 arcsec/microstep). This gives, for instance,
∼178 discrete drum positions within a range of 10 degrees (see examples shown in Fig. 10). The
maximum angular velocity in rocking mode is limited to 1 microstep/1 ms (i.e. ∼0.156 RPS). This
is due to requirement of collecting at least 10 drum position measurements for each microstep
in order to improve the S/N ratio on the drum position estimate.

The drum position is measured by a magnetic sensor with a resolution of 12-bits (i.e. 4096
values) per revolution. The quantization error and the measurement noise requires a reconstruction
of the drum position by ﬁtting a linear function to a time series of data (this will be done by ground
software). In order to estimate expected errors of the reconstructed drum positions, we carried out a
dedicated analysis. In case of rotating mode, ﬁtting the linear function to 1 s series of data (∼10000
drum position’s measurements), results in accuracy better than ±20 arcsec, which has no impact on

the spectral resolution. Reconstruction of the drum position from longer series of data can improve
the accuracy even more. In rocking mode, the function of drum angle in time is more staircase-like
than linear due to discrete drum positions. Moreover, the data series for linear ﬁtting is limited to
length of single scan (typically ∼1800 drum position’s measurements within 10 degrees scan). This
results in lower accuracy of reconstructed drum position. The error is in the range ±140 arcsec,
which aﬀects the spectral resolution. On the other hand, a great advantage of rocking mode is
much better statistics since there is no dead drum positions as present in the rotating mode.

RDS will operate by default in the rotating mode for most of the time. Rocking mode will
be activated occasionally upon command. In order to plan the operation of RDS abord ISS, we
considered the following criteria:

– assumed that in the 2021–2023 observation period, ﬂaring activity will be similar to that ob-
served by GOES in the analogous period during the 24th activity cycle (years 2011–2012);
– the fact that the uninterrupted time interval of seeing the Sun from Nauka ISS pointed platform

is ∼12 min/orbit;

– the frequency of stronger ﬂares is decreasing with increasing X-ray class of the event;
– the duration of rise and decay phases of ﬂares increases with ﬂare class.

Using properties of all elements on the optical path of the individual SolpeX blocks (such as
crystal reﬂectivity proﬁle, ﬁlter transmissions and sensitivity of detectors), the signal to be collected
over a single data gather interval DGI can be calculated according to the formula:

N [cts] =

F EA
ω

(1)

here A is the detector area (in [cm2]), ω is the scanning angular velocity and E is the eﬃciency
function, that contain the instrument ﬁlters’ transmission function and the detector eﬃciency. F is
given by:

F =

where f (λ) is the ﬂux from an on-axis point source (in [phot cm−2 s−1]) and R(λ) is the crystal
reﬂectivity proﬁle (rocking curve). In order to calculate the spectral signal to be collected by a
detector, we assumed that the source is an M5 GOES class ﬂare (T=17.22 MK, EM=2×1049 cm−3).
We calculated the expected spectral X-ray irradiance of the ﬂare using CHIANTI [4].

An example of spectra observed on each detector during a single rotation of the drum are pre-
sented in Fig. 11. The red line represents the calculated ﬂuorescence level. Fluorescence calculations

the horizontal axis the rotation angle is plotted. On the vertical axis, the log of the count rate per
one drum revolution is plotted. The point-like source characteristics are representative for an M5
class ﬂare (in GOES classiﬁcation). The rotation rate is assumed to be 10 revolutions/s. In order to
obtain good statistics, count rates from many rotations should be collected in the case of weaker
events. The red histogram levels correspond to expected background ﬂuorescence. For the most of
channels this level is below the “real” X-ray continuum.

were performed using Geant4 CERN package as described in [12]. The observed histogram of spec-
tra will be built as time progresses, with the count statistics depending on the source intensity. For
ﬂares above M5.0 class, enough photons will be recorded to study spectra variability on a time scale
of ∼1 s.

Rarely, it may happen the situation where there will be two or more active ﬂaring regions (see
discussion in Section 2). An example of a spectrum observed by RDS when two GOES M5 class
ﬂares occur on opposite limbs of the solar disc is shown in Fig. 12.

In the rocking mode it will be possible to observe fast variations of spectra in the limited, pre-
deﬁned spectral ranges covering interesting spectral bands. These bands of interest will be deﬁned
based on the inspection of spectra obtained in the long lasting fast rotation mode, although they
will certainly include the triplet lines of O vii, useful in determining the plasma densities [27],
[11], Fe xvii and Ne ix lines and other triplets of Mg xi, Si xiii, Ar xvii, Ca xix and Fe xxv,
depending on activity level. Also the components of the Mg xii Lyα and O viii spin doublets will
be studied. Such narrow-range scans will be especially useful when investigating initial ﬂare phases
for the presence of Doppler-shifted line components (Table 4).

4 The B-POL X-ray polarimeter — B-POL

The concept of B-POL X-ray polarimeter is based on the property that for Bragg reﬂections close to
Brewster angle (∼45◦), the reﬂection eﬃciency for illuminating linearly polarized radiation strongly

Fig. 13: a) Construction of B-POL measurements block from a CAD drawing. The rotation axis
pointing towards the ﬂare is indicated. b) B-POL ﬁlter (placed on the front panel of KORTES).
This ﬁlter prevents UV, visible, and IR radiation from reaching to the inside of the instrument,
while not overly attenuating X-rays in the range from 3.9 to 4.1 Å. The transmission of the ﬁlter
in this narrow spectral range is approximately ∼85%. The diameter of the ﬁlter is 104 mm. The
chosen window material is 10 µm of polyimide coated on both sides with 1200 Å of aluminium. The
polyimide window is supported by Kevlar mesh (in black) where the thickness of the threads is
0.60 microns.

depends on the angle between vector of the polarization direction and the vector normal to the
crystal plane. If the angle is close to 45◦, the eﬃciency is maximized. In order to estimate polarization
degree and orientation of the polarization plane, we will spin the crystal (i.e rotate the normal to
the crystal plane) along the direction towards the source (ﬂaring compact plasma volume in the
corona), as shown in Fig. 13.

The B-POL unit is placed in the rear section of KORTES in order to keep the rotating radi-
ator (ﬁxed to the rotating table) in constant shadow (see Fig. 1a). In order to prevent the ther-
mal/optical/XUV radiation entering KORTES, a special round thin ﬁlter is placed on the respective
aperture in front of KORTES (Fig. 13b).

The heart of B-POL polarimeter (see Fig. 14) consists of two identical, cylindrically bent mono-
crystal wafers and two receiving large CMOS detectors (GSENSE400 BSI) ﬁxed together at an angle
of ∼45◦. The detectors have 2048×2048 pixels, with the minimum read-out time of 48 frames per
second. Both crystal-detector sections are ﬁxed ﬁrmly to the table continuously rotating along the
axis directed to the source. The source selection is based on the PHI X-ray disk image. The rotation
rate of the table has been selected to be one revolution per second which represents a compromise

between the CMOS read-out time (1/48 s) and expected rate of polarization ﬂuctuations (typically
from seconds to minutes). The pointing of the rotation axis will usually be tracking the location of
the brightest region of interest by inclining the support of rotating table to the desired direction
within the angular range of ±1◦ with an accuracy better than 1 arcmin. We selected to use Sili-
con 111 ideal mono-crystal wafer bent cylindrically to a 820.97 mm radius as the dispersive medium.
The adopted crystal-detector geometry set-up presented in Fig. 16a allows spectra to be obtained
in the spectral range 3.9 Å – 4.1 Å with an exceptionally good spectral resolution of ∼90 µÅ/bin (see
Fig. 16b). This resolution is better than the instrumental spectral resolution of ∼340 µÅ which in
turn is much less than characteristic thermal/turbulent width of emission lines. The crystal-detector
unit geometry was evaluated using a method developed ﬁrst for ChemiX instrument decribed in
details in Appendix A of [18].

There are two identical crystal-detector sections (see Fig. 14) facing opposite directions mounted
on the rotating table with dispersion planes co-aligned. Such a construction (called X-ray Dopplerom-
eter arrangement [21]) will allow the precise determination of possible Doppler shifts of X-ray lines
and check whether the rotation axis is indeed directed exactly towards the centre of ﬂaring region.
Using two identical independent co-rotating sections will allow the rotational modulation of the
signal due to polarization to be separated from this caused by the source oﬀset.

Fig. 15: Changes of the crystal integral reﬂectivity during the rotation. We assumed that the
X-ray source emitted radiation made of 80% linearly polarised component and 20% unpolarised
component. The calculations were performed for the energy corresponded to the Brewster angle-
4.43 Å, and for the energies corresponding to two wavelengths at the edges of the observed spectral
range.

During the rotation of the crystal-detector unit, the position of the crystal dispersion plane with
respect to incoming light beam will continuously change. This will give rise to a modulation of the
reﬂected beam intensity provided the incident X-ray beam is linearly polarized. It has been shown
with the Electron Beam Ion Trap [1] that the polarization of the He-like triplet lines for iron and
lighter elements can be substantial and depends on the relative orientation of the EBIT particle
beam and the crystal polarimeter plane. From Fig. 1 of [1] it follows that, for Ar xvii (as well as for
much weaker Cl xvi triplet lines), the degree of polarization of w and x lines can be close to 60%
and -60% respectively. This level of polarization would easily be detected by B-POL for stronger
ﬂares. For incoming radiation being 100% polarized, the depth of signal modulation will be also
100% at the Brewster angle. For unpolarized radiation, no rotational modulation is expected. Fig.
15 presents the modulation pattern of the integral reﬂectivity of the Si 111 crystal, calculated using
the XOP package ([16]). The integral reﬂectivity is one of the crystal characteristics, which directly
aﬀects the intensity of the spectra observed.

Using properties of ﬁlters and respective geometrical characteristics of crystal-detector units,
the signal to be collected over a single data gather interval (DGI) can be calculated according to
the formula introduced in [18]. The example of the spectrum to be measured for the M5.0 ﬂare is
given in Fig. 16b.

As indicated in Fig. 16b, in the selected spectral range a number of strong emission lines are
present, due to Ar xvii, Ar xvi and S xvi. The observed spectral range will be recorded for Bragg
incidence angles close to the Brewster angle, and so their reﬂected intensities will depend on the
degree of linear polarization and respective orientation of the polarization vector relative to normal
of crystal surface.

to the detector (p=20 mm). b) Corresponding M5 class ﬂare spectrum to be recorded during one
rotation of the crystal-detector section of B-POL is presented as calculated based on CHIANTI.

The Ar as well as S lines are nearly always emitted by coronal sources activity above GOES B5.0
class level [20]. Therefore, the B-POL will record spectra not only for ﬂares in progress but also for
stronger active regions for most of the time. This will allow for studies of thermal plasma properties
like turbulence, directed motions, diﬀerential emission measure distribution and elemental compo-
sition for Ar and S. However, lines of only few elements are present in the B-POL spectral range
which was selected to optimize polarization detections. This high resolution spectral information
will supplement that received from RDS.

5 Summary

The SolpeX spectrometer consisting of three functionally dependent blocks will be placed on the
ISS as a part of KORTES Russian instrument. SolpeX consists of a simple pin-hole imager which
will identify targets (bright X-ray sources in the solar corona) for the B-POL Bragg polarimeter.
The RDS rotating spectrometer with eight ﬂat crystals will provide measurements of X-ray spectra
in a contiguous, wide wavelength range (1.3–23 Å) and will achieve maximum time resolution of
∼0.1 s. With these three X-ray measurement units, the following observations will be performed for
ﬂares and/or active regions containing plasma of temperature above 1 MK:

– ﬂare linear polarization vector characteristics at energy ∼3 keV every 1–10 s,
– AR/ﬂare spectra in the entire soft X-ray range, with time resolution of a few seconds.

These measurements will complement each other allowing substantial progress in understand-
ing the processes of magnetic energy release, transport and dissipation in various solar coronal
structures, ﬂares in particular. The success of this project will pave the way for building a larger
instrument, based on similar principles, to be placed on dedicated future solar satellites.

At the time of writing, the instrument has passed initial design review and all system require-
ments, mechanical and electrical interfaces are fully deﬁned and ﬁxed. Complete mechanical con-
struction of SolpeX has been manufactured. The B-POL unit including ﬁlter mounts underwent
vibrational tests in May 2018. No problems were detected in the frequency range expected during the
launch on Progress spacecraft. Most of electronics breadboards have been manufactured and tested
at subsystem level. The instrument is currently at a phase of engineering model manufacturing and
integration. Simultaneously, the FPGA cores are under development.
