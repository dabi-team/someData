     Abstract:  Adopting  the  thermal  bremsstrahlung  or  so-called  free-free  emission 

process,  the  coronal  and  chromospheric  magnetic  fields  are  derived  from  the 

polarization  and  spectral  observations  with  the  Nobeyama  Radioheliograph  (NoRH) 

at  17 GHz. The solar active regions  (ARs) located near the disk  center  observed on 

January 8, 2015 (NOAA 12257) and December 4, 2016 (NOAA 12615) are used for 

the  estimate  of  the  chromospheric  and  coronal  magnetic  fields  with  the  microwave 

radio observations. We compare solar radio maps of active regions for both intensity 

and  circularly  polarized  component  with  the  photospheric  magnetograms  from 

observations with the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the chromosphere-

corona  transition  region  images  obtained  with  the  Atmospheric  Imaging  Assembly 

(AIA), on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). From our analysis, we find a 

different  structure  in  the  radio  intensity  maps  between  two  active  regions  owing  to 

possibly  the  differential  rotation  of  the  Sun,  where  the  AR  12257  clearly  shows  a 

widespread structure of radio intensity, but in the case of AR 12615 which exhibits a 

narrow structure in the total intensity map. We notice from the comparison between 

radio maps of both ARs that the circular polarization degree in the AR 12257 is about 

2  %,  but  the  AR  12615  has  a  higher  existent  value  by  3  %.  Radio  observations 

provide  us  for  direct  measurements  of  magnetic  fields  in  the  chromospheric  and 

coronal  layers.  We  estimate  the  coronal  magnetic  fields  using  the  AIA  observations 

by adopting magnetic loops in the corona over some patches with weak photospheric 

magnetic fields. However, the coronal magnetic field derived from the SDO/AIA data 

was 90 - 240 G. We also study the coronal magnetic fields based on the structure of 

the extrapolated field, where the  result of the magnetic  fields  was  in  the  range  35 – 

145 G, showing that the difference in the coronal magnetic fields between both results 

is attributed to the assumption of the force-free approximation.

1. Introduction 

The  measurements  of  the  magnetic  field  of  the  solar  atmosphere  is  an 

important  key  for  understanding  many  solar  phenomena  such  as  solar 

flares,  coronal  mass  ejection  or  solar  eruptions,  coronal  heating  and 

sunspots.  The  coronal  magnetic  fields  can  be  estimated  from  different 

methods  based  on  the  structure  of  the  extrapolated  field  above  the 

photospheric  boundary  using  a  nonlinear  force-free  field  approximation 

(Moraitis  et  al.  2016).  Inoue  et  al.  (2012)  studied  the  structure  of  the 

extrapolated magnetic fields by adopting a linear or nonlinear force-free 

approximations.  However,  the  longitudinal  magnetic  field  of  the 

extrapolations of potential field was estimated in some investigations by 

(Sakurai 1982; Shiota et al. 2008; Miyawaki et al. 2016). 

Based  on  radio  observations,  the  longitudinal  magnetic  fields  can 

be  calculated  from  the  thermal  free-free  emission  process  in  some 

analyses  during  the  past  decades  (Bogod  and  Gelfreikh  1980;  Iwai  and 

Shibasaki  2013;  Miyawaki  et  al.  2016).  More  recently,  Miyawaki  et  al. 

(2016)  computed 

the  coronal  magnetic 

field 

from  polarization 

observations  of  solar  active  region  using  the  NoRH  data  at  17  GHz, 

adopting the thermal free-free emission approach. However, their method 

focused  on  determining  the  coronal  magnetic  field  from  selecting  some 

regions  of  coronal  loops  and  weak  magnetic  field  strength  in  the 

chromosphere  along  the  line  of  sight.  In  this  analysis,  the  coronal 

magnetic fields  were  found to be in the range 100–210 G.  Furthermore, 

they  derived  the  coronal  magnetic  fields  from  the  potential  field 

extrapolations  with  the  values  obtained  from  EUV  observations,  the 

estimated magnetic field strengths were 48-90 G.  

     In  this  paper,  the  coronal  and  chromospheric  magnetic  fields  are 

evaluated  from  the  radio  polarization  and  spectral  observations  of  the 

 
 
thermal  free-free  emission  with  the  NoRH  data  at  17  and  34  GHz.  The 

radio  magnetic  fields  of  active  regions  are  compared  with 

the 

photospheric  magnetograms  from  observations  taken  by  HMI  and  the 

chromosphere-corona  maps  with  the  AIA.  The  extrapolated  field 

structure  in  the  corona  above  the  photospheric  magnetograms  is  shown. 

In  Section  2,  more  details  on  the  NoRH  and  SDO  observations  are 

illustrated,  while  data  analysis  is  described  in  Section  3.  In  the  end, 

summary and discussion are presented in Section 4.       

2. Observation 

2.1. NoRH and SDO instruments 

     NoRH is a radio interferometer installed to observe the Sun to retrieve 

the structure of the magnetic fields in the active regions. It consists of 84 

parabolic antennas with 80 cm diameter,  and more details on the NoRH 

data is described in Nakajima et al. (1994). The spatial resolution of the 

radio magnetogram is about 10ʺ at 17 GHz and 5ʺ at 34 GHz. This radio 

interferometer  is  used  to  observe  the  full  solar  disk  at  17  GHz  (both  in 

circularly polarized component and in intensity) and 34 GHz (intensity), 

where  the radio data refer  to the upper levels of the chromosphere.  The 

solar radio images are synthesized every 10-seconds procedure. The Solar 

Dynamics Observatory is a NASA mission which launched on February 

11,  2010.  The  photospheric  magnetograms  are  observed  with  HMI 

(Scherrer et al. 2012) and the chromosphere-corona transition region are 

obtained  with  the  AIA  (Lemen  et  al.  2012)  for  providing  EUV 

observations at 171 Å and 304 Å. 

      Data  from  generations  of  Geostationary  Operational  Environmental 

Satellites (GOES) are shown for active regions. GOES satellite carries an 

X-Ray Sensor (XRS) to measure the total solar flux at two wavelengths 

 
bands, 0.5 – 0.4 Å and 1 - 8 Å. In Figure 1, the time variation of the total 

soft  X-ray  flux  of  the  Sun  observed  with  GOES  15.  The  AR  12615 

remained  in  the  B-class  between  22:00  UT  on  December  3,  2016  and 

4:00 UT on December 4, 2016, while the AR 12257 stayed in the C-class 

between 22:00 UT on January 7, 2015 and 4:00 UT on January 8, 2015. 

The solar AR 12257 and 12615 are used for retrieving the distribution of 

the  magnetic  field  strengths  based  on  the  theory  of  generation  and 

propagation  of  radio  emission  in  cosmic  plasma  (Alissandrakis  1999; 

Gelfreikh 1994; Lee et al. 1993; Iwai & Shibasaki 2013). Figure 2 shows 

the  photospheric  magnetograms  (left  panel)  and  radio  intensity  (right 

panel)  maps  for  two  ARs.  There  were  two  ARs  near  the  disk  center 

located  at  (NOAA  12257:  N05W14;  NOAA  12615:  S07W19).  The 

longitudinal  magnetic 

field  can  be  derived 

from 

the 

thermal 

bremsstrahlung  process  proposed  by  Bogod  and  Gelfreikh  (1980),  the 

reason for this is that the largest magnetic field in the two active regions 

with HMI is less than 2000 G. 

2.2. Estimates of Radio Magnetic Field 

     Based on the free-free emission process, the magnetic fields in coronal 

and  chromospheric 

layers  are  measured  using  single-frequency 

observations  with the  NoRH  at  17  GHz.  The  estimate  of  magnetic  field 

strength  was  developed by  Bogod  &  Gelfreikh  (1980).  The longitudinal 

component of the magnetic field, 𝐵𝑙, can be defined as follows: 

𝐵𝑙[𝐺] =

10700
𝑛𝜆[𝑐𝑚]

𝑉
𝐼

           ;    𝑛 =

𝑑(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐼)
𝑑(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝜆)

                                    (1) 

where  𝐵𝑙  is  the  longitudinal  component  of  the  magnetic  field,  V  is  the 

brightness temperature of the circularly polarized component used to find 

the  longitudinal  component  of  the  field,  I  is  the  brightness  temperature, 

 
where radio intensity includes emissions in both coronal loop plasma and 

chromosphere, λ is the wavelength of observations (1.76 cm), and n is the 

power-law spectral index of the brightness temperature between 17 GHz 

and 34 GHz.  

3. Data analysis 

3.1. Data average time and noise level 

The observation time was taken around 3:00 UT in which the raw images 

are  synthesized  using  the  Koshix  program  with  interval  10  seconds 

(http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norh/doc/manuale/index.html).  All 

images  were 

considered  for  a  better  sensitivity  of  data.  Taking  radio  magnetograms 

into account, we adopted averaging the images to reduce noise levels of 

the  data,  due  to  the  degree  of  circular  polarization  is  very  small.  The 

NoRH  data  give  us  information  for  both  the  brightness  temperature 

(Stokes-I)  and  circular  polarization  (Stokes-V)  in  units  of  Kelvin.  The 

observed Stokes parameters I and V are defined by:  

𝐼 =

𝑅 + 𝐿
2

                    𝑉 =

𝑅 − 𝐿
2

                                                      (2) 

where  the  parameters  R  and  L  are  the  brightness  temperatures  of  the 

right-  and  left-handed  circular  polarized  component,  respectively.  A 

degree of polarization (P) is given by: 

𝑃 =

𝑉
𝐼

=

𝑅 − 𝐿
𝑅 + 𝐿

                                                                                  (3) 

     In  this  analysis,  the  law  of  propagation  errors  method  of  Iwai  and 

Shibasaki (2013) is also adopted for the estimate of standard deviations of 

circularly  polarized  signal  and  degree  of  polarization  over  4-minute 

 
 
intervals in the  analyzed data.  This method was applied for  the  selected 

radio-quiet Sun regions observed on 08-Jan-2015 and 04-Dec-2016.

     The two black thick rectangles in Figure 2, in the right at the bottom 

and top panels, show the radio-quiet Sun regions used in this study. The 

radio-quiet regions  were  analyzed for the evaluate of  standard deviation 

of circularly polarized signal, minimum detectable signal level of circular 

polarized  and  average  intensity  of  the  solar  disk.  Table  1  presents  the 

estimated parameters in radio-quiet Sun regions. The standard deviations 

of circularly polarized signal (𝜎𝑉) observed on 08-Jan-2015 and 04-Dec-

2016  were  2.3  K  and  5  K,  respectively,  after the  images  were  averaged 

over 4-minute intervals in these regions. The average intensity (𝐼0) of the 

solar disk on 08-Jan-2015 was about of 10378 K while on 04-Dec-2016 

was found to be 10200 K at 17 GHz.  

     The minimum detectable signal level of Stokes V was calculated as a 

five-sigma  (5 𝜎),  which  were  about  11.5  and  25  K  for  both  radio-quiet 

Sun regions, see Table 1. 

3.2. Radio Circular Polarization, Spectra and Magnetic Field 

      From Figures 3(a) and 4(a) that the radio intensity map at 17 GHz is 

superimposed on the optical  magnetograms observed with HMI at 03:00 

 
 
 
UT  on  January  8,  2015  and  December  4,  2016,  respectively.  The 

brightness  temperatures  of  the  right-  and  left-handed  circular  polarized 

component  are  presented  in  Figures  3(b)  and  4(b).  The  red  and  blue 

contours  are  the  positive  and  negative  components  of  the  radio  circular 

polarization, respectively. The circular polarization at AR 12257 is up to 

200 K and at AR 12615 is up to 600 K for the negative polarity region. 

The  circular  polarization  degree  at  17  GHz  are  overlaid  on  the  HMI 

which is presented in Figures 3(c) and 4(c). The positive components are 

superimposed in red, and negative components are in blue contours. The 

circular polarization degree at ARs 12257 and 12615 are up to 2 % and 3 

% in positive and negative polarity regions, respectively. Figures 3(e) and 

4(e) show EUV images at 304 Å of AIA data. The black contours exhibit 

radio  intensity  at  17  GHz.  Radio  intensity  is  shown  with  respect  to  the 

bright region at 304 Å. Figures 3(f) and 4(f) also display EUV images at 

171  Å  observed  by  AIA.  The  red  and  blue  contours  represent  the  radio 

circular polarization degree at 17 GHz.  

3.3.  Coronal  and  Chromospheric  Magnetic  Fields  Components 

Compared with the Photospheric Magnetic Fields Derived from The 

Extrapolated Coronal Fields  

The radio magnetic fields are estimated from the observed radio intensity, 

radio  circular  polarization,  and  spectral 

index  of 

the  brightness 

temperature,  see  formula  1  for  details.  The  spectral  index  is  about  0.6 

around the AR. Hence, the radio magnetic fields in the positive (red) and 

negative  (blue)  components  are  80,  110  and  160  G  at  AR  12257,  see 

Figures 3(d) and 4(d). The radio field strengths are 80, 140 and 220 G in 

the positive (red) and negative (blue) polarities at AR 12615. The location 

of  radio  and  photospheric  magnetograms  are  adopted  over  400  x  400 

pixel  around  the  ARs.  Since  the  location  is  within  the  beam  size  of  the 

 
NoRH  data  at  17  GHz,  which  is  about  10ʺ.  The  comparison  clearly 

demonstrates  a  good  agreement  in  the  structure  of  the  magnetic  fields 

between the optical and radio magnetograms.  

The radio and photospheric magnetic fields are compared within 40 

pixel2  (~20ʺ)  regions.  Results of  radio  and  photospheric  magnetic  fields 

are  estimated  as  emission  average  values  in  the  adopted  regions.  At the 

center  of  active  region,  the  chromospheric  and  coronal  components  are 

included  in  the  radio  polarization  and  cannot  be  separated.  For  the 

estimate  the  magnetic  fields,  we  adopt  some  footpoints  positions  in 

negative  and  positive  polarities,  as  shown  in  Figures  3(c)  and  4(c)  at 

regions  1  and  4,  respectively.  For  both  polarities,  the  radio  magnetic 

fields are 192 G and -180 G at AR 12257. The minus sign (-) refers to the 

negative polarity region. The radio magnetic fields of AR 12615 are 351 

G  and  -457  G.  The  corresponding  photospheric  magnetic  fields  at  AR 

12257  are  854  G  and  -782  G.  Ultimately,  the  optical  magnetic  fields  at 

AR  12615  have  910  G  and  -783  G  in  two  polarities.  Consequently,  the 

comparison ratio between photospheric and radio magnetic fields is 0.22 

in the positive polarity and is 0.23 in the negative polarity at AR 12257. 

We note that the ratio is quite similar for the AR 12257. While the ratio 

between photospheric and radio magnetic fields in the AR 12615 is 0.34 

in the positive patch and is 0.58 in the negative region.        

     The  microwaves radio polarizations observed by NoRH at 17 and 34 

GHz  refer  to  the  upper  chromosphere.  The  NoRH  observations  can  be 

used for acquiring information on the coronal magnetic fields of the Sun. 

The coronal magnetic fields  are derived from the coronal loops of ARs. 

The  observed  radio  emission  is  obtained  from  the  SDO/AIA  data,  the 

photospheric magnetic fields observed by HMI are weak at these levels. 

The chromospheric component was neglected for the estimate the coronal 

 
magnetic fields. Zirin et al. (1991) and Grebinskij et al. (2000) developed 

their  methods  for  dealing  with  the  observed  brightness  temperatures  of 

the NoRH data. Hence, they adopted a two-component model atmosphere 

including  the  corona  and  chromosphere.  The  observed  brightness 

temperature  (Tb,obs),  as  a  function  of  wavelength  of  observations  (λ),  is 

defined  (Tb,obs  =  Tb,chr+  Tb,cor)  and  the  observed  circular  polarized  is 

defined by (Vobs = Vchr+ Vcor).  

For the optically thin coronal component, the electron temperature 

was  assumed  to  be  106  K.  While  the  electron  temperature  for  optically 

thick  of  chromospheric  component  was  104  K.  Therefore,  considering 

both of observed radio intensity at 17 GHz and electron temperatures of 

coronal  and  chromospheric  components  as  input  parameters,  then  the 

ordinary  and  extraordinary  modes  of  free-free  emission  have  two 

different  optical  depths.  The  coronal  magnetic  fields  are  obtained  based 

on  some  assumptions  as  follows:  a)  We  selected  some  coronal  loops 

regions in both ARs, see Figures 3(c) and 4(c) at the numbered 2, 5, 6 and 

7. b) The photospheric magnetic fields, (Bl,pho), are ~ 8 G in the selected 

regions.  c)  We  adopt  40  pixel2  (~20ʺ)  regions,  which  is  more  than  the 

beam size of NoRH (10ʺ) at 17 GHz.

Hence,  the  coronal  emission  is  derived  from  the  AIA  observations.  The 

spectral  index  is  close  to  2  for  the  optically  thin  coronal  component 

(Miyawaki et al. 2016). Using the formula 1, the coronal magnetic fields 

are  obtained.  These  results  are  estimated as  emission  average values.  In 

Table  2,  the  coronal  magnetic  fields  are  computed  at  these  regions.  We 

find the observed radio intensity in the range 9000-11000 K.  The coronal 

emission  from  AIA  data  is  900-2000  K.  The  chromospheric  intensity 

components were obtained from subtracting observed radio intensity with 

the  coronal  emission  observed  by  AIA  data.  Then,  we  find  that  this 

component  has  almost  observed  total  radio  intensity  of  7000-10000  K. 

The circular polarization (Vobs) is in the range 50-170 K. In the end, the 

coronal  magnetic  fields  are  presented  in  the  eighth  column  of  Table  2. 

From the calculation, we conclude that the coronal fields are found to be 

between 90-240 G in regions 2, 5, 6 and 7 of two active regions. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of the extrapolated magnetic field in the corona under 

the  force-free  approximation 

is  presented  in  Figure  7  on  HMI 

magnetograms for two active regions. The extrapolation code  was given 

by  Vlahos  (2017).  The  numerical  method  is  proposed  by  Alissandrakis 

(1981), and it reconstructs the 3D magnetic field above the photospheric 

boundary, where the current density (J) is parallel to magnetic field (𝐵𝑙). 

The  extrapolated  results  represent  the  coronal  loops  that  connected 

regions with intense magnetic fields and opposite polarities. We compare 

coronal  magnetic  fields  derived  from  radio  observations  and  the 

extrapolated force-free fields. The extrapolated coronal fields are found to 

be in the range 30-145 G above the photospheric boundary. We note that 

the coronal magnetic fields obtained from the linear force-free method are 

smaller than the coronal fields estimated from using the AIA data. 

Figure 5 shows  the  radio intensity at 17  and 34 GHz  and circular 

polarization  at  17  GHz  along  a  radial  cut  passing  through  the  center  of 

active region in Figure 2 (right panels). The AR 12615 is represented by 

solid lines, but the AR 12257 is presented by dashed lines. The maximum 

total intensity  at 17 GHz  is  about 2.5  x104  K  above  active  regions.  The 

circularly  polarized  components  have  weaker  signals.  However,  the 

maximum  radio  intensity  at  34  GHz  is  about  1.7  x  104  K  in  active 

regions. In Figure 6, the photospheric magnetic fields observed with HMI 

at  AR  12257  (dashed  line)  and  12615  (solid  line),  along  line  passing 

through  the  East-West  direction,  are  shown  above  two  islands  of 

magnetic fields of different polarity. The result of comparison shows that 

magnetic  fields  in  both  cases  are  quite  identical  with  indications  of 

opposite features in magnetic polarities between two active regions. The 

largest  magnetic  fields  were  about  1800  G  in  the  positive  and  negative 

polarity regions. 

 
 4. Summary and Conclusion 

Our main results are summarized as follows: 

  From  our  study,  the  maximum  radio  circular  polarization  in  AR 

12257 is about 180 K in the positive polarity region, but it reaches to 

200 K in the negative polarity region. 

  The AR 12257 has smaller observed circular polarization than the AR 

12615,  where  the  positive  and  negative  components  of  AR  12615 

have radio circular polarization up to 350 K. 

  We  note  a  widespread  structure  on  the  radio  intensity  map 

concentrated in the N-S direction for AR 12257, but in the case of AR 

12615  which  displays  a  different  structure  elongated  in  the  E-W 

direction. 

  The result of circular polarization degree is found to be in the range 

from  0.8  to  2  %  in  the  AR  12257,  while  the  AR  12615  reveals  the 

polarization degree exceeding 2.9 %. However, the intensity map of 

AR 12615 shows a  large patch of bright source than the AR 12257, 

where the radio emission of ARs originates in the coronal loop. This 

is  the  reason  for  that  the  AR  12615  shows  larger  degree  of  circular 

polarization  than  AR  12257.  The  observed  circular  polarization 

degree  is  higher  than  the  estimated  values  by  Bogod  and  Gelfreikh 

(1980) and Iwai and Shibasaki (2013), which shows a clear difference 

in  the  comparison  between  the  previous  analyses.  The  observed 

degree of circular polarization were in the range from 0.5 % to 1.7 %, 

which  found  by  Iwai  and  Shibasaki  (2013),  while  Bogod  and 

Gelfreikh (1980) obtained the degree of circular polarization up to 1.5 

%.  

  The  ratio  between  photospheric  and  radio  magnetic  fields  of  AR 

12257 is 22 % in the positive polarity region and 23 % in the negative 

 
polarity  region.  For  AR  12615  is  between  34  %  and  58  %  in  the 

positive and negative polarity regions, respectively. 

  The average intensity of the solar disk on January 8, 2015 is 10378 K 

and  10200  K  on  December  4,  2016.  The  standard  deviations  of 

circularly polarized signal on January 8, 2015 and December 4, 2016 

were 2.3 K and 5 K, respectively.  

  The  structure of the  extrapolated  magnetic  field in  the  corona  under 

the  force-free  approximation  is  presented  above  the  photospheric 

boundary.  We  estimated  the  coronal  magnetic  field  at  the  edge  of 

ARs  12257  and  12615,  where  the  radio  circular  polarization  was 

produced mainly from coronal loops, the coronal magnetic fields  are 

calculated to be 100-240 G.
