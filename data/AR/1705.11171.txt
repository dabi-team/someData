Abstract
We analyse the long-term behaviour of supergranule scale parameter, in active and quiet regions (AR, QR), using the Kodaikanal
digitized data archive. This database provides century-long daily full disc observations of the Sun in Ca II K wavelength. In this
paper, we study the distributions of the supergranular scales, over the whole data duration, which show identical shape in these
two regimes. We found that the AR mean scale values are always higher than that of the QR for every solar cycle. The mean
scale values are highly correlated with the sunspot number cycle amplitude and also with total solar irradiance (TSI) variations.
Such correlation establishes the cycle-wise mean scale as a potential calibrator for the historical data reconstructions. We also
see an upward trend in the mean scales, as already been reported in TSI. This may provide new input for climate forcing models.
These results also give us insight into the different evolutionary scenarios of the supergranules in the presence of strong (AR) and
weak (QR) magnetic ﬁelds.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar cycle refers to the 11 year periodic variation observed
in a variety of solar activities such as sunspot number, sunspot
area, 10.7 cm radio ﬂux, ﬂare occurrences, number of coro-
nal mass ejections (CMEs) etc (see Hathaway (2015) for a
complete review on solar cycle). Almost all the phenom-
ena/features on the Sun, seem to have this periodicity em-
bedded into their properties.
In this paper, we study about
a chromospheric feature, known as supergranules. These are
the large scale ( 25-30 Mm) velocity (∼ 400 m/sec) struc-
tures on the solar surface, with an average lifetime of 25 hours
(Rieutord & Rincon 2010).

Study of supergranules from the ground based telescopes
has been an interest since early 1900’s. Though there are
reports as early as 1916 (Plaskett 1916), the ﬁrst conﬁrma-
tion came from Hart (1956) who reported on ‘velocity ﬂuc-
tuations’ having a length scale of 26 Mm. In the next few
decades, a lot of work has been done on supergranules includ-
ing the ﬁrst conﬁrmation from Doppler images by Leighton
et al. (1962). Simon & Leighton (1964) realized that the
strong magnetic network-like structures (known as ‘network
boundaries’), seen through chromospheric Ca II K line, are
actually the tracer of supergranule cells. Later, Rast (2003)
showed that the evolution of the supergranules trigger the dis-
persion of the magnetic ﬁeld stored in these boundaries.

Thus, the ﬁrst step in analysing the supergranular proper-
ties, is to detect these network boundaries from Ca II K im-
ages. Several techniques have been applied by many authors
to detect the network pattern (hence supergranules): auto-
correlation technique (S´ykora 1970; Hagenaar et al. 1997),
Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) (Muenzer et al. 1989),
automated skeleton detection (Berrilli et al. 1999), water-
shed transformation (McIntosh et al. 2011; Chatterjee et al.
2017). Several properties of the supergranules, such as scale
(Srikanth et al. 2000; McIntosh et al. 2011), fractal dimension
(Paniveni et al. 2010) shows signatures of a solar cycle like
variation. In fact, Hagenaar et al. (1997); Berrilli et al. (1998)
showed that the scale distribution follow the voronoi tessella-

tion pattern. Most of these results were derived using a short
span of data (less than a solar cycle) or a couple of solar cycles
(McIntosh et al. 2011).

The other important connection of supergranule scale was
found by McIntosh et al. (2011) where the authors showed
an in-phase variation of the scale parameter, for the 23rd cy-
cle, with the ‘Total Solar Irradiance’ (TSI) cycle. Histori-
cally, this TSI was thought to be constant and considered only
to be variable in longer time period (evolutionary time scale
of the star). Only after the advent of space borne radiome-
ters, it became clear that the TSI varies in much smaller time
scales, from days to years (Willson et al. 1981). Since space
based measurements are only available from 1970’s, there are
studies which link the historical sunspot observations with the
TSI changes on solar cycle time scales (Hudson et al. 1982;
Fr¨ohlich & Lean 1998, 2004). Thus, a long-term study of the
scale property will enable us to better understand the histori-
cal TSI variations.

One of the key constraints in establishing a clear connec-
tion between the different supergranular properties with the
solar cycles, is the non-availability of a long-term uniform,
homogeneous dataset. Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KSO)
in India, has been accruing Ca II K observations since 1907.
For the ﬁrst time, these images have been used by Chatterjee
et al. (2017) to detect the supergranules in an automated man-
ner and derived different properties of them over the span of
100 years (cycle 14-23). These authors found that the super-
granule scales and fractal dimension have the 11 year solar
cycle like periodicities persistent throughout the data. One of
the highlight of this work, is the opposite correlations of the
active and quite region supergranule scales with the sunspot
number cycle.

As a follow up of Chatterjee et al. (2017) we explore further
on the properties of supergranule scale. Section 4.1 presents
investigation of supergranule mean scale variation over two
regions. Long term association of these scale values with the
TSI and the sunspot number has been analyzed in Section 4.2.
Next, the variation of the scale parameter within a given cycle

is derived in Section 4.3. We conclude by summarizing the
main results in Section 5.

2. KODAIKANAL DATA DESCRIPTION
We have used the digitized archive of Ca II K observations
captured at Kodaikanal Solar observatory, India. Originally
the images have been taken in photographic plates and re-
cently, these plates have been digitized in a 4K×4K format
at Indian Institute of Astrophysics. Digitized version of this
data, is now available for public use at https://kso.iiap.res.in/
/. This data cover a period of almost 104 years i.e from cycle
14 (decline phase only) to cycle 23. Since there are signiﬁcant
number of missing days and poor plate conditions after 1996
(Priyal et al. 2014; Chatterjee et al. 2016), we only consider
cycle 14 to cycle 22 in this study.

3. METHOD
We use the detected network boundary information as ob-
tained by Chatterjee et al. (2017). This feature extraction was
done using an automated algorithm based on the ‘watershed
technique’ (Lin et al. 2003; McIntosh et al. 2011). We again
remind the reader that these network boundaries are the prox-
ies for the supergranular cells (Simon & Leighton 1964). Re-
gions on the sun has been divided into two regimes: active
regions (ARs) and quiet regions (QRs) (see Chatterjee et al.
(2017) for more details). In this study, we use the scale pa-
rameter for each of the supergranules from daily images. The
supergranule scale is deﬁned as the radius of the circle whose
area is equal to the area of the supergranule (Chatterjee et al.
2017).

4. RESULTS
4.1. Inter-cycle Variations

Figure 1. Distributions of the supergranule scales for the AR (panel a) and
the QR (panel b) respectively. The histograms are constructed from daily
observations over the period of 1907 to 1996.

First we compare the distribution of the supergranular
scale values obtained from daily images over the whole
span of the data (cycle 14-22), separately for AR and QR.
The normalized histograms are plotted, in panels (a-b) in
Figure 1 (red for AR and blue for QR). From the plot we
readily notice that the distributions in two regimes are of
similar shape (note the closeness of the skewness parameter,
0.87 for AR and 0.80 for QR). This is interesting, since the
AR and QR represent different magnetic ﬁeld strengths and
it has been conjectured by Meunier et al. (2008) that the
network magnetic elements have a shrinking effect on the
supergranules. Also, both of these distributions resemble
well with the voronoi distribution (Hagenaar et al. 1997). In
other-words, such resemblance also indicate the goodness of

the automated detection algorithm used by Chatterjee et al.
(2017). We also note that the mean of this scale distribution
in the AR is higher (26.6 Mm) than that of the QR (25.1
Mm). This is to remind that these values are calculated over
9 solar cycles. This means, it is not clearly evident whether
such differences in the scales are persistent over all the cycles
or just an anomalous cycle lead to this overall contrast.

We probe such scenarios by calculating the mean scale for
every individual cycle, for the AR as well as for the QR. While
deriving the mean values, we also calculated the uncertainties
involved in those values. One of the primary sources of un-
certainties is the watershed detection method itself. In fact,
McIntosh et al. (2011), who have used this technique ﬁrst to
detect the supergranules, have also performed the error mea-
surements involved in this technique by utilizing 1000 Monte-
Carlo realizations. Using a Poisson noise model, these authors
found that the changes in the mean values are considerably
less than the annual and monthly variations in the value itself
(they found the variance of the mean value to be ∼0.01Mm).
Thus, we derive the errors of the average values by calculat-
ing the ‘conﬁdence interval’ (C.I). Since the sample standard
deviation is known, so the formula for the (C.I) within which
population mean should exist, reads as:

C.I = ¯X + Z ∗ × (s/

√

n)

(1)

where ¯X is the sample mean value whereas s and n are the
standard deviation and the sample size respectively. Z∗ is the
multiplier value which is set to 1.96 which corresponds to
a conﬁdence interval of 95%. Now, this number is derived
from a normal distribution. From Figure 1, we note that the
histograms are not normally distributed (in-fact positively
skewed). Since our sample size is very large (≈60,000),
we make use of the same multiplier value according to the
‘central-limit theorem’.

The results are plotted in panel (a) of Figure 2. There are
quite a few interesting features visible in this plot. Firstly, we
notice that the AR mean scale is always higher than that of
the QR, for all the cycles. Thus we conﬁrm the persistence as
questioned in the previous section. Next, we see that both the
AR and QR mean scales are oscillating with a common pat-
tern as we go through different cycles. A careful inspection,
reveal that such variation patterns are also present in sunspot
cycles which we will explore in details in following sections.
We again look back at these curves to explore more fea-
tures from them. Both the curves, seem to ride on an up-
ward moving trend. This feature is particularly interesting
as such trends are not common in solar proxies but found in
TSI from observations (Willson 1997). Though within our
data duration, we only have two distinct minima points, we
try to quantify the trends by ﬁtting the minimum points with
straight lines (dotted lines in panel 2.a). In order to estimate
these slopes along with the uncertainties, we use the conﬁ-
dence interval of the mean values as the measurement errors
during the linear ﬁtting. For the AR case the slope value is
0.10 ± 0.03 Mm/year whereas for the QR, it is 0.07 ± 0.02
Mm/year. Thus the trend is marginally steeper in AR com-
pared to QR. Though these slope values are small, but on a
longer time scales (for example, on decadal time scales) they
have a profound effect on the mean scale values.

Though the two curves show a similar variation with cy-
cles, but there are some subtle differences also. The locations

of the maxima and minima of the two curves appear at differ-
ent cycle numbers. For an example, the maxima for the AR
mean scale occurs for the 18th cycle whereas the QR curve
reaches it maximum at the 19th cycle (same happens for the
minimum also). Such small deviations in the two curves, re-
sult in a correlation value of 0.82 between them as shown in
panel 2.b. Though we have already seen the dominance of AR
mean scales over the QR values, but it is necessary to quan-
tify the difference between the two. In panel 2.c, we plot the
scale difference (AR−QR) with different solar cycles. Inter-
estingly, this difference value reaches to its maximum value
of 1.7 Mm twice (18th and 21th cycle) whereas the minimum
value of 1 Mm) also occurs twice (14th and 20th cycle).

http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/. The
details of the model algorithm and its features are described
in Coddington et al. (2016). This model TSI data has also
been updated after the revision of the sunspot number (Kopp
et al. 2016) and is also scaled to match SORCE/TIM obser-
vations. The model output is plotted in Figure 3 along with
the yearly SIDC sunspot number data (which is available at
http://sidc.oma.be/silso/).

4.2. Relations with Sunspot Number and TSI
We have seen in the previous section that the AR and
QR mean scales show oscillatory patterns (with solar cycles)
which show resemble to the amplitude variation of sunspot
cycles. In fact, as mentioned earlier, McIntosh et al. (2011)
have shown the association of the scale values with the TSI
variation only for the 23rd cycle. In this section, we extend
the study using the data over 9 solar cycles and build some
statistics.

The earliest TSI observations are available only from
1980’s from Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor
(ACRIM 1,2,3) followed by Variability of solar IRradiance
and Gravity Oscillations (SOHO/VIRGO) (since 1996) and
Total Irradiance Monitor (SORCE/TIM) (since 2003). Within
the data period investigated in this paper, we have only one
and a half solar cycle data overlap. Thus, we make use of
the historical TSI reconstruction model output. The NRLTSI2
(Naval Research Laboratory’s Total Solar Irradiance) histori-
cal TSI reconstruction (for the last 400 years) is based on the
model by Lean et al. (1995). The NRLTSI data are being pro-

Figure 3. Top panel shows the yearly variation of the TSI obtained from
NRLTSI2 model. The bottom panel shows the same but for the SSN. Solar
cycle numbers are also printed near the bottom of the panels.

Immediately from Figure 3, we note a clear resemblance
with Panel 2.a. The TSI also seem to ride on an upward trend
with the solar cycles, just like the mean scale curves. In order
to have a quantitative measure, we ﬁrst calculate the peak TSI
values (in W/m2) and peak sunspot number for each of the
cycles from Figure 3. In panels (a-b) of Figure 4, we show

the scatter plots between the peak TSI and the mean scale (for
both the regions, AR and QR) calculated for each of the cy-
cles. Now, the correlation coefﬁcients (C.C), for the two cases
are high but different: for AR it is 0.94 whereas for QR it is
0.83. Such high correlations, immediately point towards the
possible use of the cycle-wise mean scale as a calibrator for
the historical TSI data reconstructions. This has another ap-
plication, as we have seen that the an upward trend is present
for both the curves (TSI and scale). Thus one can cross-
calibrate between the trend values to set better constraints on
it as this trend has an important effect on climate forcing mod-
els (Lockwood & Fr¨ohlich 2007).

Figure 4. Panels (a-b) show the scatter plot between the peak TSI and the
mean scale values for different solar cycles whereas panel (c-d) shows the
scatter plots between the peak SSN and the mean scale values.

We also calculated the correlations between the mean scale
and the peak sunspot number of the cycles and are shown in
panels (c-d) of Figure 4. In this case too, we notice that he
AR correlation (C.C=0.86) is signiﬁcantly higher than that of
the QR. In order to explain the relatively lesser correlation
coefﬁcient for the QR regime, we note that, from Figure 2, for
the initial 4 cycles (cycle 14-17) the QR scale values did not
change (constant at ∼ 25 Mm) and this may have contributed
towards this lower coefﬁcient value. Since there are studies
which indicate small differences between sunspot number and
sunspot area series (Li et al. 2016), we have thus, computed
the correlations between the mean scale and peak sunspot area
also and the coefﬁcient values (0.87 for AR and 0.66 for QR)
are very similar to the previous values obtained using peak
sunspot numbers.

In an interesting observation, we notice that all the correla-
tion coefﬁcient values computed with peak SSN are less as
compared to the same when obtained with peak TSI. This
means that the overall supergranular scale is better following
the TSI cycle amplitude as compared to the sunspot number
cycle amplitude. One possible reason behind this could be the
linearly increasing trend which is present for both the TSI and
the mean scales but not in the SSN.

4.3. Histogram Analysis, Intra-cycle Variations
In the previous two sections, we found that the mean
scale values change considerably with different solar cycles

and they have an in-phase amplitude variation with the peak
sunspot number and the TSI values. On the otherhand, it is
expected that the scale distribution will also change within a
solar cycle i.e on a time scale of ≈11 years. To probe such
changes, we construct 2-D histograms for AR and QR and
plotted them in panel 5.a and panel 5.b respectively. The y-
axes of these plots represent the normalized histograms. The
colorbar indicate the strengths of the histograms. In-order to
minimize statistical ﬂuctuations, we use yearly data to con-
struct these histograms. Such a 2-D histogram not only cap-
tures the dominant scale locations over the time but it allows
us to study the other statistical features such as changes in
distribution widths (variance). To highlight the features, we
use contours of different levels (or strengths): C1 which out-
lines the higher (0.85) values where the other two contours,
C2 and C3, outline the moderate (0.5) and lower (0.2) values
respectively.

We shall discuss the AR histogram ﬁrst (panel 5.a). In this
case, we see that all the three contours show a clear 11 year
periodic solar cycle like variations. Now following the C1
contour, for a given cycle, we notice a very interesting prop-
erty. The contour width is large near the start of a cycle. After
that it increases by a small amount and then decreases signif-
icantly to reach its minimum value near the end of the cycle.
This means that such variation is not symmetric with the cycle
duration which is not a common case with the solar proxies
(e.g sunspot number or with sunspot area cycle). In another
observation, we note that the variations near the wings of the
distributions (in C2 and C3) are more prominent compared to
the core of the distributions. In this case, these variations fol-
low the shape of the solar cycles which eventually lead to an
in-phase alteration of the variance.

Time evolution of the QR histogram (panel b) is different
from the AR case though. We note that the width of the
C1 contour changes very little with the evolution a cycle.
Such a (near) constant width indicates that the the core of
the distribution do not change with solar cycle. Though we
must again highlight, the effect of the missing data, for the
last couple of years, is evident in the last cycle (cycle 22nd).
On the otherhand, the widths of the other two curves (C2 and
C3), do show a small amplitude anti-correlation trend with
the solar cycles (as the variation in this case is ∼1 Mm, thus
the anti-correlation behaviour appear small in the axis range
used in the plot). Thus, the anti-correlated behaviour of the
QR scale with the solar cycle, as found by Chatterjee et al.
(2017), is mainly contributed by the wings of the QR scale
distributions.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, using the Kodaikanal digitized Ca II K data,
we investigated the long-term (cycle-wise) behaviour of the
supergranule scales over multiple solar cycles. Below, we
summarize the main results from our analysis:

• We ﬁnd that the supergranule mean scales, in the AR and
QR, over the long period of time (9 solar cycle), show similar
kind of distributions. We also ﬁnd the mean scale of AR is
higher than that of the QR and the difference between the two
has a maximum value of ≈1.8 Mm.

• Calculations of the mean scale, for each of the solar
cycles, reveal an oscillating pattern for both the AR and QR.

Both of these curves depict an upward moving trend which is
steeper in AR as compared to QR. Also, we ﬁnd that the AR
mean scale is persistently higher to QR during all the cycles
(∼90 years) investigated in this study. Though there exist a
relatively high correlation between the two, but we also ﬁnd
that there are some differences in terms of the location of the
maxima and minima of the mean scale curves.

• We ﬁnd that these mean scales are signiﬁcantly correlated
with the peak TSI values. This makes them a potential
calibrator for historical TSI reconstructions.
The peak
sunspot numbers are also correlated well with the mean
the correlation coefﬁcients in both
scales.
the cases are higher in AR as compared to QR. Among
them also, we obtain a higher correlations between mean
scale and peak TSI as to mean scale and peak sunspot number.

Interestingly,

• The intra-cycle variation of the scale values are also
investigated using 2-D histograms. We note an in-phase
variation for the AR scale with the solar cycle cycle whereas
the same for the QR are anti-correlated. The spread in the
AR scale distribution is found to be higher near the start of a
cycle and become narrower at the end of it whereas for the
QR, the width remains almost invariant.

In conclusion, we see that the properties of the AR and QR
(mean) scales are quite different and have different relations
with solar cycles. The correlation values, indicate the possi-
bility of using the cycle-wise mean scale as a historical TSI
calibrator. Future studies using data from other observatories
will greatly help in constraining these relations which can fur-
ther be used by modellers for better accuracy in the model
output.
