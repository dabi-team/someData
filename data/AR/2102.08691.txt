Abstract 

The  electrical  quantum  standards  have  played  a  decisive  role  in  modern  metrology, 
particularly since the introduction of the revised International System of Units (SI) in 
May  2019.  By  adapting  the  basic  units  to  exactly  defined  natural  constants,  the 
quantized Hall resistance (QHR) standards are also given precisely. The Von Klitzing 
constant  RK = h/e2  (h  Planck's  constant  and  e  elementary  charge)  can  be  measured 
precisely using the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and is thus the primary representation 
of the ohm. Currently, the QHR standard based on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure has 
succeeded in yielding robust resistance measurements with high accuracy <10−9. 

In  recent  years,  graphene  has  been  vastly  investigated  due  to  its  potential  in  QHR 
metrology. This single-layer hexagonal carbon crystal forms a two-dimensional electron 
gas system and exhibits the QHE, due to its properties, even at higher temperatures. 
Thereby,  in  the  future  the  QHR  standards  could  be  realized  in  more  simplified 
experimental conditions that can be used at higher temperatures and currents as well as 
smaller magnetic fields than is feasible in conventional GaAs/AlGaAs QHR. 

The  quality  of  the  graphene  is  of  significant  importance  to  the  QHR  standards 
application.  The  epitaxial  graphene  growth  on  silicon  carbide  (SiC)  offers  decisive 
advantages among the known fabrication methods. It enables the production of large-
area graphene layers that are already electron-doped and do not have to be transferred 
to another substrate. However, there are fundamental challenges in epitaxial graphene 
growth.  During  the  high-temperature  growth  process,  the  steps  on  the  SiC  surface 
bunch together and form terraces with high steps. This so-called step-bunching gives 
rise to the graphene thickness inhomogeneity (e.g., the bilayer formation) and extrinsic 
resistance  anisotropy,  which  both  deteriorate  the  performance  of  electronic  devices 
made from it. 

In  this  thesis,  the  process  conditions  of  the  epitaxial  graphene  growth  through  a  so-
called polymer-assisted sublimation growth method are minutely investigated. Atomic 
force microscopy (AFM) is used to show that the previously neglected flow-rate of the 
argon process gas has a significant influence on the morphology of the SiC substrate and 
atop  carbon  layers.  The  results  can  be  well  explained  using  a  simple  model  for  the 
thermodynamic  conditions  at  the  layer  adjacent  to  the  surface.  The  resulting  control 
option of step-bunching on the sub-nanometer scales is used to produce the ultra-flat, 
monolayer graphene layers without the bilayer inclusions that exhibit the vanishing of 
the  resistance  anisotropy.  The  comparison  of  four-point  and  scanning  tunneling 
potentiometry measurements shows that the remaining small anisotropy represents the 
ultimate limit, which is given solely by the remaining resistances at the SiC terrace steps.  

Thanks to the advanced growth control, also large-area homogenous quasi-freestanding 
monolayer  and  bilayer  graphene  sheets  are  fabricated.  The  Raman  spectroscopy  and 
scanning  tunneling  microscopy  reveal  very  low  defect  densities  of  the  layers.  In 
addition, the excellent quality of the produced freestanding layers is further evidenced 
by  the  four-point  measurement  showing  low  extrinsic  resistance  anisotropy  in  both 
micro- and millimeter-scales.

ABSTRACT 

The precise control of step-bunching using the Ar flow also enables the preparation of 
periodic  non-identical  SiC  surfaces  under  the  graphene  layer.  Based  on  the  work 
function  measurements  by  Kelvin-Probe  force  microscopy  and  X-ray  photoemission 
electron  microscopy,  it  is  shown  for  the  first  time  that  there  is  a  doping  variation  in 
graphene, induced  by  a proximity  effect  of  the  different near-surface  SiC  stacks.  The 
comparison  of  the  AFM  and  low-energy  electron  microscopy  measurements  have 
enabled  the  exact  assignment  of  the  SiC  stacks,  and  the  examinations  have  led  to  an 
improved understanding of the surface restructuring in the framework of a step-flow 
model.  

The knowledge gained can be further utilized to improve the performance of epitaxial 
graphene  quantum  resistance  standard,  and  overall,  the  graphene-based  electronic 
devices. Finally, the QHR measurements have been shown on the optimized graphene 
monolayers.  In  order  to  operate  the  graphene-based  QHR  at  desirably  low  magnetic 
field ranges (B < 5 T), two known charge tuning techniques are applied, and the results 
are discussed with a view to their further implementation in the QHR metrology.

Kurzdarstellung 

Elektrische Quantennormale spielen eine wichtige Rolle in der modernen Metrologie, 
besonders seit der Einführung des revidierten Einheitensystems (SI) im Mai 2019. Durch 
die Zurückführung der Basiseinheiten auf exakt definierte Naturkonstanten sind auch 
die  quantisierten  Werte  von  Widerstandsnormalen  (QHR)  exakt  gegeben.  Die  Von-
Klitzing-Konstante  RK  =  h/e2  (h  Planck-Konstante  und  e  Elementarladung)  lässt  sich 
mittels  des  Quanten-Hall-Effekts  (QHE)  präzise  messen  und  ist  somit  die  primäre 
Darstellung des Ohm. Die Quanten-Widerstandsnormale bestehen aktuell aus robusten 
GaAs/AlGaAs-Heterostrukturen,  die  eine  Genauigkeit  <10−9  für  die  Widerstands-
Messung erlauben.  

In  den 
letzten  Jahren  wird  verstärkt  Graphen  auf  sein  Potenzial  für  die 
Widerstandmetrologie untersucht.  Der einlagige hexagonale Kohlenstoffkristall bildet 
ebenfalls ein zweidimensionales Elektrongas aus, das den Quanten-Hall-Effekt zeigt – 
und  dies  auf  Grund  seiner  Eigenschaften  schon  bei  höheren  Temperaturen.    Damit 
könnten in Zukunft Widerstandsnormale für vereinfachte experimentelle Bedingungen 
realisiert  werden,  die  bei  höheren  Temperaturen  und  Strömen  oder  kleineren 
Magnetfeldern  eingesetzt  werden  können,  als  es  mit  konventionellen  GaAs/AlGaAs- 
QHR möglich ist.

beim 

In  dieser  Dissertation  werden  zunächst  die  Prozessbedingungen  des  mittels  der 
sogenannten Polymer-Assisted-Sublimations-Growth-Methode  hergestellten  epitaktischen 
Graphens auf SiC genauer untersucht. Mithilfe der Rasterkraft-Mikroskopie (Atomic-
Force-Microscopy,  AFM)  wird  gezeigt,  dass  es  einen  erheblichen  Einfluss  der  bisher 
wenig  beachteten  Flussrate  des  Prozessgases  Argon  auf  die  Morphologie  des  SiC-
Substrates und der oberen Kohlenstoffschichten gibt. Anhand eines einfachen Modells 
für die thermodynamischen Verhältnisse in einer oberflächennahen Schicht lassen sich 
die Ergebnisse hervorragend erklären. Die sich daraus ergebende Kontrollmöglichkeit 
des  Step-bunching  auf  Sub-Nanometer-Skalen  wird  genutzt,  um  ultraflache, 
monolagige  Graphenschichten  ohne  Bilageneinschlüsse  herzustellen,  die  eine 
verschwindende  Widerstandsanisotropie  aufweisen.  Der  Vergleich  von  Vierpunkt-
Messungen  und  Scanning-Tunneling-Potentiometery-Messungen  zeigt,  dass  die 
verbleibende  geringe  Anisotropie  das  ultimative  Limit  darstellt,  die  allein  durch  die 
verbleibenden Widerstände an den SiC-Terrassenstufen gegeben ist.

KURZDARSTELLUNG 

Dank der fortschrittlichen Wachstumskontrolle werden auch großflächige, homogene 
quasi-freistehende  Monolage-  und  Bilage-Graphenschichten  hergestellt.  Die  Raman-
Spektroskopie  und  die  Rastertunnel-Mikroskopie  zeigen  sehr  geringe  Defektdichten 
der Schichten. Darüber hinaus wird die hervorragende Qualität der hergestellten quasi-
freistehenden Schichten durch die Vierpunkt-Messung unter Beweis gestellt, die eine 
geringe extrinsische Widerstandsanisotropie zeigt. 

Die präzise Kontrolle des Step-bunching mittels Ar-Fluss ermöglicht auch die gezielte 
Präparation  von  periodischen,  nicht-identischen  SiC-Oberflächen  unter  der 
Graphenlage.  Anhand  von  Messungen  der  Austrittsarbeit  mit  Kelvin-Probe-Force-
Microscopy  und  X-ray  Photoemission-Electron-Microscopy  konnte  erstmals  gezeigt 
werden, dass es eine Variation der Graphendotierung, induziert durch einen Proximity 
Effekt der unterschiedlichen oberflächennahen SiC-Stapel, gibt. Der Vergleich von AFM 
und Low-Energy-Electron-Microscopy-Messungen ermöglicht die genaue Zuordnung 
der  SiC-Stapel  und  die  Untersuchungen  führen  insgesamt  zu  einem  verbesserten 
Verständnis  der  Oberflächen-Umstrukturierung  im  Rahmen  eines  adäquaten  Step-
Flow-Modells.  

Die  gesammelten  Erkenntnisse  können  zur  Verbesserung  der  Eigenschaften  von 
Graphen-Quantennormalen  und  auch  allgemein  von  graphenbasierten  Bauteilen 
genutzt  werden.  Abschließend  werden  QH-Widerstandsmessungen  an  optimierten 
Graphen-Monolagen  gezeigt.  Um  den  Magnetfeldbereich  (B < 5 T)  einzuschränken, 
werden  zwei  bekannte  extrinsische  Dotiertechniken  verwendet  und  die  Ergebnisse 
werden im Hinblick auf den weiteren Einsatz in der QH-Metrologie diskutiert.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION  

1.1. Historical background 

The graphene discovery may go back to 1859 when Benjamin Brodie discovered 
a new form of carbon called “graphon” as the material we know as graphene 
oxide  nowadays.  [1]  “Die  Dünnste  Kohlenstoff-Folien”  literally  meaning  “the 
thinnest carbon layers,” was the title of the paper published in 1962 by Boehm et 
al., who indeed looked at the single carbon layers. [2,3] For a single carbon layer 
of  the  graphitic  structure,  Boehm  et  al.  in  1986  coined  the  term  “graphene” 
derived from the first part of the graphite  and the ending  “ene” that  refers to 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. [4]  

On  the  other  hand,  in  1896,  the  first  graphitization  of  silicon  carbide  was 
patented  by  E.  G.  Acheson.  [5]  This  corresponds  to the  period  that  X-ray  was 
discovered,  which  boosted  delving  into  the  details  of  crystal  and  surfaces  in 
various materials. Importantly, the X-ray was used to characterize the graphite 
obtained  by  the  thermal  decomposition  of  SiC  much  later  in  1965  by  D.  V. 
Badami.  This  happened  almost  a  quarter-century  after  that  P. R.  Wallace  [6] 
introduced the graphite's band structure. In his study, D. V. Badami identified 
epitaxial  graphene  on  SiC  and  reported  the  relationship  between  the  crystal 
orientation of graphite and underneath 6H-SiC. [7]

Ten years later, in 1975, A. J. Van Bommel et al. investigated the graphite on SiC 
(obtained by Si sublimation of SiC (0001) in high-vacuum) using the low-energy 
electron diffraction (LEED), which revealed a (6
3)R30° surface reconstruction, 
the  so-called  buffer  layer.  [8]  The  first  intercalation  (i.e.,  penetration  of  small 
species in, e.g., graphite layers) and separation (i.e., exfoliation) of graphite flakes 
were  carried  out  by  Schafhaeutl  back  in  1840.  [9]  The  unique  electronic 
properties of such flakes, the so-called freestanding layers, were not discovered 
yet  at  that  period.  The  high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy 
(HRTEM) could directly visualize a thin graphene layer on the Si-face of SiC in 
contrast  to  the  SiC  C-face.  [10]  A  breakthrough  happened  in  2004  in  a  study 
carried out by C. Berger et al., in which two-dimensional electron gas properties 
of ultrathin epitaxial graphite were reported and led to an enormous expansion 
in  this  area.  [11]  The  groundbreaking  isolation  of  the  graphene  flakes,  using 
mechanical  exfoliation  of  highly  ordered  pyrolytic  graphite  (HOPG),  was 
introduced by A. Geim and K. Novaselov in 2004. [12,13] 

Even  though  the  exfoliation  of  graphene  from  graphite  was  an  easy-to-use 
technique  and  led  to  numerous  studies  demonstrating  unique  features  of 
graphene [14,15], the main drawbacks have been complicated thickness control, 
reproducibility, and small flake sizes. These all have been the objective of further 
research considering the epitaxial graphene growth on SiC as a method with the

potential to attain the large-area graphene. In about 2008, improved graphene 
layers were obtained by ex-situ (i.e., in argon ambient) growth instead of in-situ, 
which latter is known to result in rough graphene formation. [16,17] A year later, 
the so-called quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) was fabricated, 
in  which  the  buffer  layer  (6
3)R30°  turned  to  monolayer  graphene  by 
annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. [18]

A peculiar application of epitaxial graphene, the quantum resistance standard, 
was  introduced  by  A.  Tzalenchuk  et  al.  in  2010.  [19]  This  work  inspired  the 
metrology working groups to use graphene, e.g., as a replacement for the GaAs 
heterostructure for the QHR metrology purposes.  

In  the  same  year,  in  several  studies,  the  graphene  growth  mechanism  on  SiC 
using  the  HRTEM  and  the  buffer  layer's  atomic  structure  using  scanning 
tunneling  microscopy  (STM)  was  revealed.  [20,21]  Using  the  angle-resolved 
photoemission electron microscopy (ARPES) electronic band structure of single 
and bilayer graphene was reported. [22] H. Hibino et al., by using the low-energy 
electron microscopy (LEEM) method, successfully counted the number of carbon 
layers on SiC. [23] The 100 GHz graphene-based transistors and later operation 
of  wafer-scale  graphene  integrated  circuits  were  reported  by  Y-M.  Lin  et.  al. 
[24,25].  

In 2011, graphene was produced on SiC using the CVD method by W. Strupinski 
et  al.  [26],  following  the  earlier  efforts  of  CVD  graphene  synthesis  on  other 
substrates. [27–29] The origin of doping, n-type in epitaxial graphene, and p-type 
after hydrogen intercalation (QFMLG) was explained by J. Ristein et al. [30,31]. 
Also,  there  were  several  attempts  to  transfer  epitaxially  grown  graphene  on 
other substrates. [32,33] The  epitaxial graphene nanoribbons were reported as 
ballistic  conductors  by  J.  Baringhaus  et  al.  [34].  A  significant  improvement  in 
adlayer-free and sizeable graphene fabrication has been achieved through both 
the CVD [35] and epitaxial graphene growth [36–38] methods, and the latter has 
resulted in almost vanishing of a so-called resistance anisotropy induced by SiC 
substrate. [38,39] In 2014, epitaxial graphene was used as the basis for the growth 
of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). [40]  

In  pursuit  of  growing  other  low-dimensional  materials,  epitaxial  graphene 
provides an excellent platform, as shown by several recent studies. [41–45] This 
makes  epigraphene  a  great  material  of  choice  for  various  theoretical  and 
practical applications, as for metrological purposes, which is the primary focus 
of this thesis.

1.2. Thesis objective and structure 

For  the  realization  of  robust  and  reliable  performance  of  the  graphene-based 
quantum Hall resistance (QHR) metrology, high-quality graphene samples are 
demanding.  This  thesis  aims  to  investigate  and  understand  the  epitaxial 
graphene  growth  on  silicon  carbide,  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  for  a 
sizeable,  reproducible,  and  pure  monolayer  graphene  synthesis.  This  study 
further explores the fabrication of different graphene types and employs various 
characterization analysis to scrutinize both locally and macro-scales the samples' 
quality. 

After  this  introductory  in  Chapter  1,  a  brief  overview  of  the  graphene's 
fundamental properties, the mechanism of epitaxial graphene growth on SiC, the 
crystal structure of hexagonal SiC polytype, as well as the basics of the quantum 
Hall effect in graphene will be given in Chapter 2. It also includes an introduction 
to a so-called buffer layer and intercalation technique for the fabrication of the 
so-called freestanding graphene layers.  

Chapter  3  provides  a  short  description  of  the  characterization  techniques 
employed in this thesis.  

Chapter 4 presents the sample preparation, cleaning, different growth recipes, 
and microfabrication processes.  

In Chapter 5, the fabrication results of diverse graphene types including buffer

Chapter 6 covers a systematic study of a so-called extrinsic resistance anisotropy

2.1. Crystal and electronic properties 

Graphene is a material that integrates several excellent electronic, optical, and 
thermal properties. This is so far unique to graphene because, for instance, one 
can find materials that are as conducting or transparent as graphene, but one can 
scarcely  find  any  materials  that  are  simultaneously  electrically  conducting, 
optically transparent (with a wide range of the optical spectrum from infrared to 
ultraviolet) and mechanically flexible. Graphene is an allotrope of carbon, which 
is the 4th most abundant element in nature. Moreover, it is low-cost, eco-friendly, 
sustainable,  and  importantly  its  2-dimensional  structure  makes  it  compatible 
with  the  traditional  semiconductor  processing  planar  structure  and  can  be 
practically integrated into the existing mainstream technology. [15]

neighboring carbon atom with an out-of-plane π-binding, see Figure 2.1a. The 
strong σ-bonds makes graphene one of the most mechanically stable materials. 
Due to the Pauli principle, these bands have a filled shell and thus form a deep 
valence  band.  [46]  In  the  case  of  π-band,  since  each  p-orbital  has  one  extra 
electron, the π band is half-filled. Half-filled bands are important as they lead to 
several interesting electronic properties, e.g., in transition elements. The π-states 
are  also  responsible  for  the  electrical  conductivity  in  graphene  and  interlayer 
coupling in graphite. [47] Importantly, delocalized electrons in its π-system are 
responsible for the excellent electronic properties. [15,48,49] Figure 2.1b depicts

At the Dirac points, the graphene’s band spectrum is closely similar to the Dirac 
spectrum for massless fermions.  Figure  2.1c  shows the graphene's  conduction 
and valance bands touch each other at the K and K' points. Thus, graphene can 
be  considered  as  a  gapless  semiconductor.  Accordingly,  the  energy  band 
dispersion relation in graphene shows a linear feature, see  Figure 2.1d, where

the energy dispersion

semiconductors or metals. Considering the tight-binding Hamiltonian model for 
electrons  in  graphene,  they  can  hop  to  both  the  nearest-  and  next-nearest-

All that so far were briefly discussed are associated with the properties of single-
layer graphene. When two or more graphene layers stack on top of each other, 
they form so-called bilayer (BLG) or few-layer (FLG) graphene, respectively. The 
interaction between the layers drastically changes the properties of carbon layers 
in  the  stack  compared  to  that  in  a  single  layer.  For  instance,  in  BLG,  a  band 
splitting  occurs,  and  the  linear  dispersion  is  lost.  [51]  Another  example  is  the 
unconventional quantum Hall effect (QHE) of BLG compared to the QHE in the 
monolayer graphene. [52,53] In general, the electronic band dispersion near the 
Fermi  level,  and  consequently,  the  nature  of  the  charge  carriers,  is  highly 
sensitive  to  the  number  of  layers  and  the  stacking  geometry.  This  will  be 
explored  in  multiple  aspects  from  electronic  transport  (e.g.,  resistance 
anisotropy) to magneto-transport (e.g., VdP and QHE) within this work.  

2.2. Magneto-transport 

There  are  two  distinct  known  kinds  of  integer  quantum  Hall  effect:  (i)  the 
conventional  quantum  Hall  effect  which  occurs  in  2D  semiconductors  (e.g., 
GaAs/AlGaAs  heterostructure,  for  example)  [54],  and  (ii)  a  counterpart  QHE 
which is observed in monolayer graphene resulting in shifted positions of the 
Hall  plateaus.  The  latter  is  related  to  the  massless  relativistic  characteristic  of 
charge carriers in graphene, which mimics Dirac fermions. [14,55,56] The third 
type of QHE was reported for bilayer graphene. [52] Perhaps, a fourth kind could 
also be possibly addressed as recently was shown in graphite with a thickness of 
hundreds  of  atomic  layers.  Although  QHE  in  3-dimensions  (3D)  is  forbidden 
(destruction  of  the  quantization  due  to  spreads  of  Landau  levels  into 
overlapping bands in 3D), the measured QHE was attributed to a dimensional 
reduction of electron dynamics in high magnetic fields. [57] In the following, the 
abovementioned QHE types (i) and (ii) are briefly described.

),

2.2.1. Integer quantum Hall effect 

The  classical  Hall  effect  is  observed  when  current  flows  through  an  electrical 
conductor in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. [58] The Hall effect 
arises  from  the  fact  that  a  magnetic  field  (B)  causes  charged  particles  with  an 
effective mass of m* to move in a circle (cyclotron) with a fixed frequency equal 
. A schematic of the Hall-measurement is depicted in Figure 2.2. 
to 
Due to the Lorentz force, electrons are deviated and propagate to the edge of the 
sample. This leads to a transversal voltage 
, the so-called Hall-voltage. 
The Hall voltage depends on externally applied parameters (i.e., magnetic field 
B, and current I) and equals for one type of charge carrier in the implemented 
semiconductor (e.g., electrons) as follows:

where n is three-dimensional charge carrier density, t is thickness, and e is the 
electron  charge.  The  Hall  measurement  allows  calculating  the  charge  carrier 
density of the material under investigation. From the Hall coefficient (AHall) in 
(2-5) the type of charge carrier can be identified; for the electron (holes), the sign 
of AHall becomes negative (positive).

 is known as the flux quantum. The Hall resistivity should take the value (2-7) 
when  ν  Landau  levels  (LLs)  are  filled.  This  will  be  explained  further  in  the 
ϕ0
following. As seen, RXY depends only on the fundamental constants proportional 
to h/e2. [59,60] For this fundamental resistance, a new constant was defined and 
is known as the von Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 = 25812.8074555 Ω. [61] 

The  IQHE  is  explained  in  terms  of  single-particle  orbitals  of  an  electron  in  a 
magnetic field and is related to the Landau quantization. [54,62] In the presence 
of the magnetic field, the energy states are reconfigured to certain discrete energy 
levels  known  as  Landau  levels  (LLs),  which  are  the  allowed  energies  for 
cyclotron orbits under quantization conditions (Figure 2.3a, and b). This means 
that when ν Landau levels are filled, there is a gap in the energy spectrum, so to 
occupy the next state it costs energy that is proportional to 
 is cyclotron 
frequency). LLs are formally calculated by solving the Schrödinger equation for 
free  electrons in the presence  of electric and magnetic fields.  Accordingly, the 
problem reduces to that of a harmonic oscillator shifted by the magnetic length

ℏ = ℎ/2𝜋
When  the  Fermi  level  lies  in  a  gap,  the  electronic  scattering  rate  vanishes. 
Without scattering, the electrons cannot move along a direction perpendicular to 
both the electric and magnetic fields. Hence, the longitudinal resistance (RXX) is 
zero,  and  Hall  resistance  is  given  by  (2-7).  Theoretically,  each  LL  is  a  heavily 
degenerate δ-function in the density of states (DOS) filled with localized states 
undergoing cyclotron motion. Therefore, from the equation (2-7), it is expected 
that  the  quantization  of  resistance  happens  exactly  when 
  LLs  are  filled. 
Experimentally, nevertheless, even when the Fermi energy lies between two LLs, 
the resistance quantization (plateaus in the QHE regime) is still present. This is 
due  to  the  broadening  of  LLs  as  a  result  of  disorders  existing  in  the  system. 
[63,64] Disorders result in two different kinds of electronic states: localized and 
extended states at each LL. This situation is shown in Figure 2.3a-b.  

ν

The localized states do not carry current, while the extended states do. Although 
the existence of an impurity reduces the number of states  which can carry the 
current,  however,  in  an  oversimplified  model,  it  can  be  assumed  that  the 
electrons  passing  by  an  impurity  will  speed  up  to  increase  the  current  to 
compensate  exactly  the  deficit  of  current  due  to  the  presence  of  the  localized 
state. [63]  

In  practice,  the  realization  of  QHE  can  be  achieved  either  by  (i)  flowing  a 
constant current (fixed Fermi level, i.e., fixed carrier density) while varying the 
magnetic field or (ii) by varying the carrier density via a gate in a fixed magnetic 
field. In case (i) by increasing the magnetic field, the energy spacing between LLs 
enhances, and because the EF is fixed, higher LLs are emptied, and as each one is 
emptied, the RXY increases.  

In case (ii) by increasing the electron density, the different electronics states are 
gradually filled up, which is equivalent to shifting the Fermi energy EF through 
the DOS. When EF moves in a mobility gap (localized states), the occupation of 
the extended states does not change, and since only these states carry the current, 
the Hall resistance will not change either, leading to an extension of Hall plateau. 
When EF reaches the next Landau level, dissipation occurs in the system, and the 
Hall resistance goes to the next plateau. Hence, the QHE can be regarded as a 
successive  localization–delocalization  transitions  when  the  Fermi  energy  EF 

12 

 
CHAPTER 2. THEORY AND CONCEPTS 

moves  through  the  DOS.  Peaks  in  RXX  are  observed  each  time  the  Fermi  level 
crosses  the  center  of  an  LL,  and  the  plateaus  in  RXY  and  vanishing  RXX  are 
observed whenever the Fermi level lies in between the LLs. [65]  

The steps in RXY in the QHE occurs when the LLs filled with the localized carriers 
undergo  the  cyclotron  motion.  As  carriers  undergo  cyclotron  motion,  they 
include quantum of magnetic flux, thus the number of localized carriers per unit

The linear energy dispersion of monolayer graphene leads to a modification of 
the  magneto-transport  in  graphene.  Accordingly,  the  energy  gap  between 
neighboring  Landau 
is  not  equidistant,  as  with  conventional 
semiconductors  (e.g.,  GaAs/AlGaAs).  In  graphene,  the  energy  dispersion  of 
carriers around 
 is similar to that of ultra-relativistic particles with zero 
mass 
. Thus, the Dirac equation is used to describe carriers' behaviors, which 
mimic massless Dirac Fermions around the Dirac points. [15,64] Accordingly, the 
cyclotron  frequency  from  the  conventional  2D-systems  is  modified  for  Dirac 
Fermions, as shown in (2-13). The LL spectrum is then given by (2-14).

The epitaxial graphene on SiC is highly n-doped (

SiC substrate and buffer layer. The buffer layer with donor-like behavior has a

degrades  the  gating  efficiency,  i.e.,  by  remarkably  diminishing  the  gate

applications. Besides, the charge transfer from the bottom SiC and buffer layer

epitaxial SiC/G layer are strongly influenced by its surface morphology, in which 
there is a direct relationship between the resistivity of epitaxial graphene on SiC 
and its step-heights. [68–70] Therefore, producing graphene with smaller step-
height distribution was intended in this study.

2.3. Epitaxial graphene on SiC (0001)  

There exist several methods and principles to synthesize graphene which can be 
generally  summarized  into  two  categories:  the  top-down  approach  (e.g., 
mechanical  exfoliation  [13],  liquid-phase  exfoliation  [71],  and  graphene  oxide 
reduction [72]) and the bottom-up approach such as epitaxial graphene growth 
via  silicon  sublimation  growth  on  SiC  or  chemical  vapor  deposition  (CVD) 
method. [8,11,26,73,74] The epitaxial graphene through the CVD method can be 
grown on SiC but also on  various other substrates such as Cu, Ni, Ir, and Ru. 
[75–77] The SiC is special since it is indeed the only substrate containing a vast 
amount of carbon, which allows epitaxial graphene production without the need 
for any reactive gas, i.e., by simple high-temperature graphitization under Ar or 
vacuum. A large-scale already doped graphene fabrication directly on insulator 
without the need for transfer makes epitaxial graphene growth on SiC special, 
among other techniques. 

2.3.1. Growth mechanism 

Hexagonal polytypes of SiC have two possible surface terminations, i.e.,  Si- or 
C-face,  see  Figure  2.4a.  The  termination  substantially  affects  the  graphene 
growth process. In this study, it is referred to as “silicon face growth” concerning 
epitaxial  graphene  grown  on  SiC  (also  as  epigraphene  or  SiC/G).  Epitaxial 
graphene on SiC is one of the best candidates for the wafer-scale production of 
graphene-based devices. [8,11,73]  

Silicon carbide has a tendency towards graphitization when it is annealed under 
elevated temperature in vacuum or atmospheric pressure. The growth process is 
driven  by  the  sublimation  of  silicon  atoms  from  the  SiC  surface  and  the 
subsequent rearrangement of the remaining carbon atoms into a densely packed 
honeycomb structure. [75] The number of graphene layers, stacking layers, and 
coupling  to  the  substrate  varies  with  crystal  face  orientation  and  growth 
conditions. [20,21] 

The graphitization of SiC (0001) can be understood as two successive steps, in 
which first, a so-called buffer layer is formed. Further decomposition provides 
carbon  atoms  under  the  buffer  layer,  and  they  form  a  new  buffer  layer.  The 
original buffer layer loses its bonding with the SiC substrate and then turns into 
graphene. This is schematically shown in Figure 2.4b and c. During the material 
growth, the atoms are organized by themselves to reduce their total free energy. 
The  atoms  rearrange  into  their  energetically  most  favorable  sites  in  the  given 
environment, provided sufficient thermal energy and time is allowed. [75]

Precise control of growth conditions as well as careful selection of crystal type, 
face side, and miscut angle are required for the growing single layer of graphene. 
The temperature of the substrate plays an important role. The time of annealing 
is another parameter for controlling the growth rate. Also, annealing in the argon 
environment and the argon flow-rate significantly influence the graphitization 
process. [16,37,38,78] 

During  the  graphitization  process  of  a  SiC(0001)  surface,  the  Si-rich  surface 
transforms into a C-rich surface,  and the surface  atoms  arrangement  typically

Since the buffer layer is partially covalently bound to the underlying Si (Figure 
2.4b),  it  does  not  exhibit  graphene-like  electronic  properties.  [16,73,81,82] 
However, the buffer layer has a graphene-like lattice, with undistorted σ states 
but a distorted 
 band. The  distortions are caused by  covalent  bonds forming 
between  a  part  of  the  carbon  atoms  (about  1/3)  in  the  buffer  layer  and  the 
underlying silicon atoms. [83,84] Quasiperiodic (6 × 6) domain pattern emerges

In a growth model by Norimatsu et al. [85],  it was argued that because the area 
densities of the C atoms in ideal graphene and a single SiC bilayer have values 
of  32.9 nm-2  and  10.5 nm
2,  respectively,  the  formation  of  one  graphene  layer 
requires  about  three  SiC  bilayers.  This  suggests  that  for  the  fabrication  of 
−
graphene,  including  its  buffer  layer,  at  least  about  six  Si-C  bilayers  will  be 
consumed. Moreover, when the buffer layer has formed, proceeding the growth 
requires much higher energy.

Also, after the formation of graphene, the growth rate drastically decreases. This 
happens  because  the  overgrown  carbon  layers  act  as  a  Si-diffusion-barrier, 
hindering Si sublimation from the surface, and therefore proved a self-limiting 
feature to graphene growth on SiC(0001). [87] In contrast, the growth on the C-
face  of SiC is hardly controllable and leads to multilayer graphene formation. 
[88]  This  is  important  in  growth  kinetics  when  a  high  thickness  control  for 
fabrication  pure  graphene  layers  (e.g.,  BFL,  MLG,  or  BLG)  is  desired. 
Furthermore, The Bernal stacked bilayer graphene that grows on SiC has a semi-
conducting nature; therefore, depending on the charge carrier density can show 
either metallic or insulating behavior. [22,89–91] In the context of this thesis, such 
inhomogeneities  (e.g.,  BLG  inclusion)  in  graphene  synthesis,  electronic 
transport, as well as Hall bar fabrications, are investigated. 

2.3.2. Intercalation 

Since its discovery over a century ago, intercalation has enabled the creation of 
different materials for various applications. [1,92–94] Importantly, intercalation 
can be applied to the epitaxial buffer layer/SiC to physically decouple it from the 
substrate. This has been performed through a wide range of intercalating species, 
e.g.,  H,  Ge,  Ga,  O,  Li,  Au.  [18,41,43,95–101]  Beyond  that,  epigraphene  is  an 
excellent  platform  to  create  sub-dimensional  elemental  and  compound  layers 
using  the  intercalation  method.  [42,102–106]  The  influence  of  the  covalent 
bonding in the buffer layer is one of the primary suspects for the heavily reduced 
mobility in epigraphene compared to exfoliated graphene. The limited mobility 

19 

 
CHAPTER 2. THEORY AND CONCEPTS 

was  attributed  to  a  combination  of  Coulomb  and  short-range  scattering  from 
charge traps in epitaxial graphene and strong electron-phonon scattering. [107–
109] For the same reasons, the carrier mobility in graphene is firmly temperature 
dependence. [110]  

This  effect  can  be  ameliorated  by  the  intercalation  technique,  which  leads  to 
producing  “quasi-freestanding”  epitaxial  graphene.  Figure  2.4b-e  depicts 
hydrogen  intercalation  applied  on  the  epitaxial  buffer  layer  and  monolayer 
graphene  resulting  in  quasi-freestanding  monolayer  graphene  (QFMLG)  and 
quasi-freestanding  bilayer  graphene  (QFBLG),  respectively.  While  epitaxial 
graphene on SiC is originally n-type (~1013 cm
2) [16], depending on the served 
intercalants  p-type,  n-type,  and  charge-neutral  graphene  can  be  obtained. 
−
[94,95,100,111]  Interestingly,  for  Au  and  Ge  intercalants,  depending  on  the 
thicknesses of the elemental layers below carbon layers, either  p- and n-doped 
graphene can be produced. [101,112] Hydrogen intercalation, which yields a p-
doped freestanding graphene layer, has vastly been studied by several groups. 
[18,38,108,113–121]  However,  the  precise  atomic  intercalation  mechanism  in 
epitaxial graphene is still not completely understood.  

Although  the  principle  of  intercalation  is  simple,  in  practice,  a  scalable 
freestanding  layer  is  not  readily  achievable.  The  main  challenge  is  the  low 
thickness 
quality  of  epitaxial  buffer-  or  graphene 
inhomogeneity.  Moreover,

incomplete decoupling or even etched areas. In this study, the high quality of 
large-area epitaxial buffer- and monolayer graphene layers are further tested by 
hydrogen intercalation. A hydrogen (5%) gas dissolved in argon (95%) was used, 
thereby also the influence of gas purity in the intercalation process is intensively 
investigated. These all will be discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.

2.4.1. Crystal structure 

The  compound  named  ‘’Kohlensilicium’’  (silicon  carbide),  with  an  exact 
stoichiometry  of  Si:C = 1:1,  was  discovered  in  1824.  [122]  The  SiC  possesses 
extraordinary  mechanical,  nuclear,  and  electrical  properties  made  it  a  great 
candidate to be used in a vast array of applications. Importantly, due to its broad 
bandgap semiconductor nature, the SiC is particularly useful for high power and 
high-frequency devices and thereby the linchpin to “green energy” that would 
replace less energy-efficient silicon-based technology switches (for high currents 
and  voltages).  [123–126]  Reaching  these  widespread  applications  had  been 
challenging for many years because of fundamental problems in growing high-
quality  single-crystal  boules  free  of  micropipe  defects  and  micrometer-scale 

20 

CHAPTER 2. THEORY AND CONCEPTS 

pinholes  formed  by  dislocations,  however  nowadays  have  been  substantially 
improved. [125]  

From the crystallographic aspects, SiC is a special versatile substance in which 
more than 200 crystal modifications, so-called polytypes are so far known. [127] 
These structures differ both in the order  (in which cubic and hexagonal layers 
are arranged) and in the number of layers in  the unit cell. [128] Polytypes are 
often  characterized  by  Ramsdell  designations  (mainly  due  to  its  formal 
shortness) [129], constituted by a natural number, equal to the number of layers 
in  the  period  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  basal  plane,  and  a  letter 
symbol  characterizing  the  crystal  system  of  the  Bravais  lattice:  C,  cubic;  H, 
hexagonal; R, rhombohedral. [123,130] There is only one cubic polytype, 3C-SiC, 
sometimes referred to as β-SiC, while all the others are called α-SiC. [75] The 3C-
SiC can be prepared at much lower temperatures (1473 to 2273 K) than hexagonal 
polytypes  (2473  to  2773  K)  and  was  shown  to  be  beneficial  for  graphene 
sublimation  growth.  Nonetheless,  it  is  not  commercially  available  since  it  is 
complicated  to  grow  high-quality  material  without  double  positioning 
boundaries, also called twin boundaries. [31]–[33]  

In  the  binary  compound  SiC,  each  carbon  atom  is  surrounded  by  four  silicon 
atoms (and vice versa), which form tetrahedron crystal structure by strong sp3 
orbitals, as either SiC4 or CSi4, see Figure 2.6a, b. As seen in Figure 2.6a, b there 
exist  two  different  kinds  of  subsequent  Si-C-tetrahedra  modifications:  one 
resulting in a hexagonal “h” site and one resulting in a cubic “k” site, both just 
differing  in  a  60◦  twist  of  the  upper  tetrahedra.  [130]  This  can  be  followed 
through the cyan-color lines in Figure 2.6b, which depicts the continued or linear 
stacking (cubic), which always have the same orientation (staggered orientation). 
The  cyan-color  line  in  Figure  2.6a  indicates  the  60°  rotation  in  the  hexagonal 
tetrahedron, i.e., the stacking from one to the next double layer is switched (also 
called switched stacking or eclipsed orientation). [134]

Figure 2.6c. Depending on this stacking order, different polytypes with different 
crystal modifications will result. The Si–C bonding energy is 289 kJ/mol (~2.995 
eV)  with  a  distance  d = 189 pm.  The  distance  between  two  similar  atoms  is

height of the tetrahedron, is 252 pm. Figure 2.6d and e sketch the unit cell of 4H-
SiC and 6H–SiC, which are among the most common polytypes and are used in

60°  rotated  related  to  each  other.  Accordingly,  three  terrace  types  with  inequivalent 
surface energies exist. Different length arrows indicate the different etch velocities (during 
growth) of the steps. The blue arrows were proposed by Nakajima et al. [137] and red ones 
by Borovikov et al. [138]. See the text for details. 

2.4.2. Step flow 

Both surfaces of 4H- and 6H-SiC polytypes are promising materials for epitaxial 
graphene growth. For our purpose, the growth of single-layer graphene, Si-face, 
gives  higher  growth  thickness  control  while  on  the  C-face  leads  to  multilayer 
graphene  formation.  [139]  The  4H-  and  6H-SiC  wafers  with  polished  and 
protected (by a so-called epi-ready layer) surfaces are  commercially available. 
The  wafers  are  cut  from  large  SiC  boules  with  a  small  miscut  angle  towards 
definite crystal planes.  

The  cross-sectional structure and associated bilayer stacking sequences of 6H-
SiC  (0001),  is  shown  in  Figure  2.7.  After  cutting  the  6H-SiC  polytype  with  a 
misorientation angle, six possible terminations shape at the SiC surface (S1, S2,

S3,  S1*,  S2*,  S3*).  The  Sn/Sn*  nomenclature  denotes  different  types  of  surface 
configurations, and "n" indicates the total number of identically orientated Si−C 
bilayers (n= 1, 2, 3). Equivalent layers, but rotated by 60° are labeled by (n*). [140] 
Thus, this in total gives three configurations at the very top of the surface.  

During etching and growth on SiC, the surface undergoes a restructuring process 
in which the steps move and group together (so-called step-bunching process). 
The final shape of the SiC crystal surface is often determined by a minimization 
of  the  total  surface  free  energy.  Since  the  terraces  have  inequivalent  surface 
energies  (due  to  the  physical  relationship  with  the  underlying  bilayers),  the 
etching/growth is driven by a “step flow.”  

The step-bunching mechanism, e.g., during graphitization or hydrogen etching 
of the SiC surfaces, has been vastly studied [137,138]. F.R Chein and S. R. Nutt 
[141] suggested a step bunching model during the growth of 6H–SiC. On account 
of this growth model, Nakajima et al. [137] and Borovikov et al. [138] proposed 
step flow models that seem to be not entirely confirming each other and therefore 
are discussed here.

The  E0  is  the  energy  of  a  Si–C  pair  without  interaction  between  neighboring 
layers. From these energy values, it can be expected that the S1 termination is the 
fastest grown surface (since it requires the lowest energy to be grown) while the 
S2 and S3 are the second and third fast grown surfaces, respectively. In their step 
flow model, Borovikov et al. [138] proposed that the terrace, which is growing 
faster, would then be slower removed during the etching process. This accounts 
for  the  energy  minimization  and  stability  reason,  which  means  fast-growing 
steps  are  the  slowest  in  etching  and  vice  versa.  Accordingly,  the  etching  rate

In this model, the given energy to etch a surface is equal to the negative energy 
value of the surface below. These results indicate that the S2 (6H3) surface is the 
most difficult bilayer for desorbing, i.e., the most stable one. Correspondingly, 
 S3 >S2, as shown with the blue-color arrows 
the etch velocity is as follows: S1
in Figure 2.7. Although in the literature, these two models are assumed identical, 
they  indeed  are  not.  Both  models  agree  that  the  S1/S1*  has  the  highest 
decomposition  velocity.  However,  discord  is  seen  for  the  second  and  third 
decomposition  surface  velocities,  i.e.,  S2/S2*  and  S3/S3*  layers  in  6H-SiC.  The 
high-controlled  synthesis  presented  in  this  study  allows  us  to  experimentally 
evaluate  these  step-flow models. In  Chapter  7, the step-bunching is discussed 
within a framework of a step-flow model that considers a joint hexagonality and 
cubicity of bonds in off-bond and on-bond directions. It will be experimentally 
shown that the terrace S1 will first catch terrace S2 and form two Si–C bilayers 
(~0.5 nm). If the growth proceeds, the terrace S3 will advance and merge with 
the two bilayer steps and creates a three Si–C bilayers height (~0.75 nm). Also, 
for the 4H-SiC polytype, the step flow model can be conveniently applied since 
there are only two types of terminations. This will be studied in Chapters 6, 7, 
and appendix A6. 

2.4.3. Miscut and crystal planes 

Both miscut angle (also called tilt-angle, misorientation angle, or off-axis angle) 
and crystal orientation substantially influence the growth as well as electronic 
properties  of  overgrown  carbon  layers.  Surface  orientations  are  given  by  the 
miscut angle between the surface plane concerning a crystallographic plane. If 
truncating  of  SiC  happens  perpendicular  to  the  c-axis  with  no  inclination 
(absolute  0°-off),  then  it  should  turn  out  an  entirely  flat  surface.  The 
misorientation  of  the  surface  is  the  reason  that  flat  terraces  are  formed 
interrupted by step edges of a certain height corresponding to the miscut angle. 
The misorientation angle plays a decisive role in graphene morphological and

technical reasons can occur, e.g., warp and bow of the surface. Local deviations 
from the given value can appear close to dislocations or crystal defects.

angle [37,146–148] and the crystal direction [137,149–152] are important for the 
process of, e.g., hydrogen etching. The latter was shown on the surfaces tilted 
  leading  to  a  higher  etching  rate  along  with  the  steps  than 
toward  [
perpendicular to the steps. As a result, straight steps could be formed on these 
surfaces. In contrast, the etching rate was reported to be higher perpendicular to 
 thus, therefore, zigzag like steps 
the steps on the surfaces tilted toward 
could be formed. The SiC crystal plane thus decisively influences both the etch 
and growth processes. [153–155]

2.4.4. Polarization doping 

As shown in Figure 2.6, the structures of SiC polytypes can be viewed as stacking 
of cubic(k) or hexagonal(h) Si-C bilayers on top of another. The Si–C bond has 
predominantly a covalent character (88%) with small (12%) ionic contribution (Si 
positively, C negatively charged). [75] Except for the 3C-SiC (zero hexagonality), 
other  SiC  polytypes,  i.e.,  hexagonal  polytypes,  with  lower  symmetry  possess 
inequivalent  Si-C  bonds  property.  In  the  3C-SiC,  all  four  sp3  orbitals  have 
equivalent properties, whereas in hexagonal polytypes, there is a preferential c-
axis, and the sp3 orbital is extended along this axis, which differs from the other 
three. [156] For example, in 6H-SiC along the c-axis, the distance of k-k double 
layer (i.e., Si-C bilayer with both C and Si owning cubic positions) was measured 
to be 2.5163 ± 0.0008 Å and for h-k bilayers equal to 2.5212 ± 0.0004 Å. Therefore, 
the Si-C bonds parallel to the c-axis (on-bond) are longer than those inclined to 
it  (off-bond).  [157–159]  Correspondingly,  there  is  charge  transfer  from  the 
weaker (longer) longitudinal bonds to the stronger (shorter) transverse bonds. 
These  bond-to-bond  charge  transfer  and  structural  (ionic)  relaxation  cause  an 
intrinsic so-called spontaneous polarization (SP). [159] Therefore, the SP, which 
generally occurs in dielectric crystals, can be interpreted as a superposition of 
localized dipoles due to each of the stacking boundaries, and it is mainly due to 
the charge density redistribution. [159,160]

CHAPTER 2. THEORY AND CONCEPTS 

In  bulk,  the  net  electric  field  across  the  unit  cell  vanishes  imposed  by  phase 
periodic  boundary  conditions.  Nevertheless,  at  the  surfaces,  the  translation 
symmetry is broken, and the dipoles may add up  forming an uncompensated 
polarization field. As a result, the electrostatic (Hartree) potential will increase 
or  decrease,  leading  to  an  electrostatically  unstable  surface  unless  a  source  of 
hole or electron trapping is attached to it, e.g., by attracting charges from the air. 
Indeed,  this  makes  the  SP  of  crystals  very  difficult  to  be  determined  both  in 
practice  and  theory.  This  effect  becomes  vital  when  it  comes  to  epitaxial 
graphene. 

The  SiC  substrate  influences  the  electronic  properties  of  epitaxial  graphene 
layers in multiple ways. QFMLG on hexagonal SiC obtained by H-intercalation 
is highly p-doped. This p-doping was attributed to the SP since: (i) QFMLG on 
3C-SiC (SP is missing) is not p-type (but slightly n-type due to defects), (ii) the 
Si–H  bonds  are  electronically  inactive  (no  doping  contribution),  (iii)  the 
passivated surface is supposed to be in principle defect-free (hence no doping 
contribution),  and  (iv)  the  depletion  of  the  bulk  doping  of  SiC  (especially  for 
semi-insulated SiC) is insufficient for the substantial doping (corresponding to 
areal  ns < 5  1010  cm
2  in  the  depletion  layer  of  SiC  substrate),  therefore  the 
strong  hole-doping  is  directly  associated  with  the  SP  effect.  Herein,  the 
−
spontaneous polarization creates a pseudo-acceptor layer at the surface that is 
fully equivalent to real acceptors. 

Furthermore,  since  the  SP  along  the  (0001)  direction  remains  negative  for  all 
hexagonal SiC polytypes, only p-doping should be induced at the Si terminated 
quasi-freestanding graphene (QFG) systems.  [30,160,161]  

The  SP  also  has  a  vital  impact  on  the  doping  of  epitaxial  graphene  grown  on 
SiC (0001), which includes a buffer layer. The pseudo-acceptor charges from SiC 
are  overcompensated  by  the  broad  donor-like  states  from  the  buffer  layer 
superimposed with donor-states from the carbon and silicon dangling bonds on 
the surface. 

Moreover,  there  is  a  linear  relationship  between  the  bandgap  and  degree  of 
hexagonality in all SiC polytype: it varies from ~2.39 eV in the 3C structure (0% 
hexagonality)  to  ~3.30  eV  in  the  2H  form  (100%  hexagonality).  [157]  For  the 
polytypes  of  interest  in  this  work,  the  4H  (50%  hexagonal)  and  6H  (33% 
hexagonal), the bandgap is about 3.23 eV and 3.0 eV, respectively. Accordingly, 
higher  doping  (with  a  factor  of  ~1.5)  of  epitaxial  graphene  on  4H  is  typically 
expected than on 6H. [31]  

Interestingly,  for  the  most  common  4H-  and  6H-SiC  polytypes,  an  extensive 
calculation study by Sławińska et al. [161] estimates a certain dependence of the 

27 

CHAPTER 2. THEORY AND CONCEPTS 

doping on the precise location of the stacking defects (hexagonal bilayer) closest 
to  the  surface.  Accordingly,  for  a  given  thickness,  the  doping  decreases  by 
~2  1012 cm
2,  the  deeper  it  (stacking  defect)  is  buried,  which  is  due  to  the 
depolarization effect of the crystalline layers at the surface, see Figure 2.8.  This 
−
interesting  calculation  shows  that  an  ample  range  of  doping  can  be  achieved 
almost  continuously  by  controlling  the  number  of  stacking  defects,  their 
concentration, and their proximity to the surface top graphene layers. A similar 
effect was expected from other somewhat elder density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations. [157,159,162–164]  

The experimental results presented in this thesis give evidence for the theoretical 
prediction  by  Sławińska  et  al.  [161]  demonstrating  that  the  graphene  doping 
depends  not  only  on  the  bulk  polarization  but  also  on  a  SiC  termination 
dependent polarization doping effect. This will be discussed in detail in Chapters 
5 and 7. 

Please note that the SP is independent of strain (not like piezoelectric) and can 
be observed in other wurtzite crystals (e.g., III-nitrides). The SP makes it possible 
to directly manipulate the electronic properties (e.g., carrier concentration) in a 
semiconductor  like  conventional  doping  without  using  impurity  dopants. 
[165,166] Moreover, the polarization-induced internal electric field leads to the 
so-called  quantum-confined  Stark  effect  in  the  quantum  nanostructures  as 
recently was shown in defects (e.g., vacancy) in SiC below epigraphene [166,167], 
indicating still much room for further studies.

3. Characterization techniques 

Abstract 

I 

n  the  framework  of  this  thesis,  several  versatile  characterization  techniques 
were  employed  to  investigate  more  in  detail  the  quality  of  different  types  of 
graphene  samples  considering  their  morphological,  electronic  transport,  or 
magneto-transport  properties.  This  chapter  is  devoted  to  showing  the  working 
principle  of  the  implemented  experimental  techniques,  which  support  the 
discussions in the next chapters. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

3.1. Atomic force microscopy 

Atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM),  as  a  valuable  and  versatile  surface  analysis 
technique, is often used to display the real space morphology of samples on μm-
scales.  In  this  thesis,  the  AFM  as  a  standard  technique  was  regularly  used  to 
characterize the samples’ surface properties. The main component of AFM is a 
cantilever with a sharp tip. During measurement, the tip scans over the surface. 
Following the atomic force interaction between the tip and substrate, the AFM 
can  generate  informative  images  of  the  substrate.  The  NANOStation  AFM 
(produced  by  S.I.S)  used  in  this  study  provides  a  pronounced  resolution  that 
precisely resolves structures with height equals to ~0.25 nm. The SSS-NCLR or 
PPP-NCLR are the AFM silicon tips fabricated by NanosensorsTM that were used 
in this work. Figure 3.1 indicates the principle of AFM used in this work. The 
device combines optical microscopy and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in a 
Zeiss Axiotech microscope. The local deflection between the probe and substrate 
is measured by a fiber-optic interferometer. It is based on the principle of optical 
retardation  between  a  reference  wave  and  a  detected  wave.  The  diode  laser 
provides laser light via a fiber-optic coupler to the fiber-optic cable mounted to 
the measuring head (cantilever). Some of the incident light is reflected at the fiber 
end, where it defines the reference wave, and at the top-side of the cantilever, 
where it defines the detected wave. The two waves interfere with each other and 
are  transmitted  back  to  the  photodiode  via  the  fiber-optical  coupler.  The 
resulting  intensity  of  the  created  signal  is  detected  in  the  photodiode  to  be 
further  processed.  As  the  AFM  scan  across  the  surface,  the  tip’s  motions  (up, 
down,  and  side  to  side)  are  monitored  via  the  laser  beam  reflected  from  the 
cantilever. 

Technically, the contact (DC) mode and non-contact mode (AC) (applied in this 
study)  are  two  modes  that  are  applied  for  AFM  measurement.  In  DC  contact 
mode,  the  tip  is  permanently  in  contact  with  the  substrate  during  scanning, 
which may damage the tip and cantilever as a result of a shear force. In the non-
contact (AC) mode, the tip is adjusted appropriately in minimum contact with 
the substrate while the cantilever oscillates. This mode records information from 
the substrate's surface in which the tip is not in contact (or in an intermediate 
contact) with the substrate. 

Important  information  about  the  substrates  examined  with  the  AFM  (in  AC 
mode) can be extracted from their phase images. The AFM generates the phase 
image  by  monitoring  the  phase  lag  between  the  signal,  which  drives  the 
cantilever to oscillate (in non-contact mode), and the actual cantilever oscillation 
signal. From the phase contrasts in the AFM phase image, one can understand 
variation in surface properties (e.g., elasticity, stiffness, friction, and adhesion) 

30 

CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

and the existence of different materials, which all may cause the phase contrast. 
The  AFM  phase  imaging  is  based  on  the  detection  of  variation  in  the  energy 
dissipated  in  a  local  region  of  the  sample  surface.  [168]  The  AFM  phase 
inspection may sometimes be considered as a non-trivial technique for studying 
the  surfaces.  However,  it  is  extensively  used  in  this  work,  for  instance,  to 
investigate  the  interaction  between  the  graphene  and  bottom  SiC  surface 
terminations, as discussed in detail in Chapter 7.

3.2. Kelvin probe force microscopy 

(KPFM) 

force  microscopy 

is  primarily  based  on 

the 
Kelvin  probe 
instrumentation of an AFM. [169] The KPFM is implemented to investigate the 
graphene  quality,  considering  the  thickness  and,  more  importantly,  its 
interaction with the SiC substrate. The principle of the KPFM technique is shown 
in Figure 3.2. When two different conductors, here sample and tip, are brought 
into electrical contact, electrons will flow from the one with lower work function 
) to the one with higher work function, equalizing the Fermi energies. They 
(
could be assumed as a capacitor (parallel plates) if they are not in contact but 
ϕ
proximity plate, thus equal, but opposite charges will be induced on the surfaces. 
The potential generated between these two surfaces is called the contact potential 
difference  (CPD),  or  surface  potential,  which  is  equal  to  the  work  function 

31 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

difference of the two materials. This CPD can easily be measured by applying an 
external  bias  until  the  surface  charges  disappear,  wherein  the  external  bias 
equals the CPD (VDC = VCPD).  

The KPFM is a tapping mode technique and is performed in this work in double-
pass mode, in which at first trace the topography of the sample is recorded and 
then in a certain lift distance from the substrate the contact potential difference 
(VCPD) is captured. The VCPD directly depends on the work function of the sample 
and tip, thereby gives straightforward information about the Fermi levels of the 
sample and tip. Similar to the AFM which can detect atomic forces by amplitude 
or frequency modulations (AM or FM), KPFM can measure the electrostatic force 
(F
)  either  by  AM  or  FM  modes,  the  latter  (FM  mode)  known  to  have  much 
higher  spatial  resolution  and  accuracy.  [169,170]  The  tip  and  sample  form  a 
capacitor with an electrostatic force (Fes) in between, which is:

In  the  double  pass  model,  the  mechanical  excitation  of  the  cantilever  is 
deactivated,  and  a  voltage  (VAC  sin(ωt)  +  VDC)  is  applied,  therefore  the 
ΔV = Vtip ± VCPD = (VDC ± VCPD) + VAC sin(ωt). By substituting ΔV in the equation 
(3-1), the Fes will be as follow, including three parts (where ω = 2πf0.):

The AC bias leads to oscillation force (Fω and F2ω) at two harmonics of ω and 2ω 
when  the  (VDC  ±  VCPD)  is  not  zero.  AM-KPFM  measures  Fω  directly  from  the 
amplitude of the cantilever oscillation at ω that is induced by VCPD and VAC. The 
feedback  loop  in  AM-KPFM  tries  to  maintain  the  Fω  by  using  the  oscillation 
amplitude  (VAC)  until  the  VAC  drops  to  zero  when  VDC  equals  the  CPD.  With 
knowing the work function of the tip (

be determined as ϕsample

The frequency of the AC bias is typically selected to be the resonant frequency 
(f0) of the AFM cantilever for enhanced sensitivity afforded by the cantilever’s 
quality factor (Q). Figure 3.3 displays a block diagram of our KPFM (AM) setup. 
A KPFM made by JPK Instruments AG was used to study the samples in this 
works.  The  KPFM  was  equipped  with  a  conductive  coated  (Cr/Pt,  5/25  nm) 
micromachined  monolithic  silicon  tips  (Tap300E-G,  r=25nm)  from  ‘’budget 
sensors’’. Although the KPFM operation is relatively simple, however, the low 
spatial  resolution,  distance  tip  dependency,  the  apex  of  tip,  geometry  of 
conductive  probe  [171],  measurement  environment  influences  (e.g.,  air, 
vacuum), parasitic capacitance, tip quality all in particular for AM mode strongly 
limit  a  quantitative  investigation  of  the  sample.  Therefore,  generally,  the 
technique suffers from a weak lateral resolution ~50–70 nm. [169,170,172] 

3.3. Raman spectroscopy 

As  a  non-destructive  tool,  Raman  spectroscopy  enables  valuable  information 
about the crystal's phononic properties. In this work, the Raman spectroscopy as 
a  powerful  method  was  implemented  mainly  for  characterizing  the  thickness 
[173], doping [174], strain [175], and defects [176–178] of graphene samples.

resonant conditions. Figures are partly taken from refs. [75,179].

CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

The  Raman  spectroscopy  technique  is  based  on  an  inelastic  light  (photons) 
scattering (Raman scattering) by phonons. When the photons hit on a sample, a 
time-dependent perturbation occurs in the kinetic and potential (Hamiltonian) 
energies  in  the  system.  Because  of  the  photon  rapidly-changing  electric  field, 
only  electrons  respond  to  this  perturbation.  Herein,  the  measurement  process 
involves  the  excitation  of  electrons  in  the  crystal  from  a  ground  state  (EGS) 
through the monochromatic light (ћωL) lead to an energy increase to EGS + ћωL 
(virtual state).  

Rayleigh scattering happens when the excited electron-hole pair returns to the 
ground state, and the frequency of the emitted and incident photons remains the 
same,  but  only  the  propagation  direction  of  the  photon  may  change  (elastic 
scattering).  

With  a  much  lower  probability  compared  to  Rayleigh  scattering,  the  Raman 
scattering  happens  when  the  incoming  photon  loses  part  of  its  energy  while 
interacting with a phonon, therefore, leaving the sample with a lower energy of 
ћωSc. This is known as the Stokes process. The energy is equal to ћωL - ћωSc = ћΩ 
(An  incoming  photon  ωL  excites  an  electron-hole  pair.  The  pair  decays  into  a 
phonon Ω and another electron-hole pair).  

If the incoming photon finds the sample in an excited vibrational state, after the 
interaction process, the system comes back to its ground state, and the photon 
can exit the sample with an increased energy of ћωSc = ћωL + ћΩ. This corresponds 
to  the  anti-Stokes  process  and  has  been  reported  to  be  less  probable  than  the 
Stokes  process.  Therefore,  the  Raman  scattering  is  displayed  as  the  Stokes 
measurement intensity of the scattered light due to the difference between the 
incident and scattered photon energy known as the “Raman shift.” The unit of 
the Raman shift is usually written as cm
1, which can be converted in meV as 
 0.124  meV).  [75,179,180]  The  non-resonant

Raman scattering is when EGS
 + ћωL does not correspond to a stationary state, as 
is indeed the case for most materials. [179]

The  principles  of  Raman  spectroscopy  in  graphene  can  be  better  understood 
considering the origin of the different vibrational modes, as shown in the phonon 
band dispersion in Figure 3.5. Since graphene has two atoms in its unit cell, six 
phonon  branches  exist,  including  three  acoustic  (A)  and  three  optical  (O) 
phonons. Four of these phonons (two O and two A) are in-plane (i), and the other 
two phonons (one A and one O) are out-plane (o). If the vibration direction is 
perpendicular to or parallels with the carbon-carbon bonds, then the modes are 
classified as transversal (T) or longitudinal (L), respectively. The Raman bands 
of graphene mainly are due to the iLO and iTO vibration modes. [178,181]

G,  2D  peaks)  of  SiC  substrate  (black), monolayer  graphene  (blue),  and  bilayer  graphene 
(red). 

Considering the Raman spectra of epitaxial graphene, three prominent features 
are  essential:  the  so-called  D-peak,  G-peak,  and  2D-peak,  as  demonstrated  in 
Figure 3.5b. The G-Peak is a first-order non-dispersive Raman scattering band, 
originated from the in-plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in graphene. 
As shown in Figure 3.6a-c, by impinging the incident photon (blue arrow), an 
electron-hole pair is excited at the Γ-point of the first Brillouin zone. The electron-
hole pair is scattered by the iTO or iLO phonons and recombines by emitting a 
photon.  Since  the  G-peak  is  directly  related  to  graphene's  Fermi  energy,  it  is 
experimentally significant for investigating the carrier density in graphene. [174] 

The  D-peak,  the  second-order  dispersive  Raman  scattering  is  due  to  the 
breathing-like modes of six-atom rings, see Figure 3.6d, e. The D-peak appears 
in the presence of point defects or grain boundaries. The intensity ratio of D/G 
reflects the number of defects and grain size. [173,176,178] 

All  Raman  mappings  were  performed  on  a  LabRAM  Aramis  (Horiba  Jobin 
Yvon) confocal Raman spectrometer, which is equipped with a Czerny Turner 
spectrograph  enabling  a  spectral  resolution  < 1  cm

sources (532 nm (~2.33 eV) Nd:YAG, 632 nm (~1.96 eV) HeNe, 785 nm (~1.58 
−

1), and a thermoelectrically cooled CCD detector. The Nd YAG laser was used as 
a radiation source by focusing the laser beam onto the graphene sample through 
a 100× objective (N.A. 0.95). A piezo stage (PI) mounted on top of a motorized

occurs  through  a  second-order  process,  which  is  either  double  resonant  (f)  or  triple 
resonant (g). [178] 

3.4. Scanning electron microscopy 

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is used to scan the substrates by exposing 
a focused electron beam and generating images, including information about the 
substrate's  topography  and  composition.  As  depicted  in  Figure  3.7,  the  SEM 
instrument comprises three major sections: the specimen chamber, the electron 
column, and the electronic controls (PC). The latter provides control knobs and 
switches  that  allow  for  instrument  adjustments  such  as  filament  current, 
accelerating voltage, focus, magnification, brightness, and contrast. The electron 
column is where the electron beam is generated (in a vacuum), focused to a small 
diameter  (via  condenser  lenses),  and  scanned  across  a  specimen's  surface  by 
electromagnetic deflection coils. The specimen chamber is located at the lower 
side of the column, wherein the specimens are mounted and secured onto the 
stage. Figure 3.7 shows the main components of the SEM. The free electrons are 
generated via the electron gun located at the top of the column.  Electrons are 
primarily accelerated toward an anode that is adjustable by an applied voltage.

microscope. 
Adapted from ref. [182] 

The electron beam will be focused after passing the anode and being influenced 
by two condenser lenses that  cause  the  beam to converge  and pass through a 
focal point. [182] The electrons in the beam penetrate the surface (a few microns) 
of a bulk sample, interact with its atoms and generate a variety of signals such 
as secondary and backscattered electrons (which are used to form images) and 
X-rays, which are used to obtain elemental constitution of the specimen material. 
The ultimate lateral resolution of the image obtained in the SEM corresponds to 
the electron beam's diameter. Advances in the lens and electron gun design yield 
very fine probe diameters giving image resolutions between 1nm to 20 nm, and 
depending on the instrument, can reach a point resolution <1 nm. [182] 

The nature and type of contrast in SEM image depend on the type of specimen 
and its interaction with the electron beam and the number of electrons emitted 
from  the  specimen  based  on  the  operating  conditions  employed  during 
microscopy. The difference in the signal between the two points may arise due 
to  many  factors,  including  change  in  specimen  topography,  the  difference  in 
composition, crystal orientation, magnetic or electric domains, surface potential, 
and  electrical  conductivity.  However,  most  images  depict  a  combination  of 
contrast  mechanisms.  For  example,  a  material  (the  term  phase  is  more 
appropriate) with a higher atomic number will appear relatively brighter (due 
to a larger number of backscatter electrons being ejected out of this phase) while 
a phase with a low atomic number will appear relatively dark. [182–184] These 
types  of  contrasts  are  important  and  required  to  be  adequately  noticed  for  a 
correct  interpretation  of  the  SEM  images,  particularly  in  epitaxial  graphene 
wherein  the  SEM  contrast  could  arise  from  various  sources,  e.g.,  buffer  layer,

The  SEM  measurements  on  the  samples  in  this  study  have  been  mostly 
performed  at  PTB  Braunschweig  by  Peter  Hinze  and  Kathrin  Stör  from

microscope  (FESEM)  from  Carl  Zeiss  SMT  that  allows  acceleration  voltages

3.5. Scanning tunneling: microscopy, potentiometry, 
spectroscopy 

The invention and discovery of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) by Binnig 
and Rohrer in 1981 [185] has enabled an atomically resolved image of almost any 
conducting surface. In this work, STM was used to characterize the quality of the 
graphene  with  atomic  resolution.  In  addition  to  STM,  which  enables  us  to 
scrutinize  the  graphene  morphology,  also  scanning  tunneling  potentiometry 
(STP) was used, which facilitates investigating the local charge transport on the 
atomic scale. Experiments were conducted in a UHV chamber at room- or low-
temperatures with a pre-cleaning of the samples in UHV. 

The STM is based on the quantum mechanical tunneling effect. The basic idea 
behind STM is illustrated in Figure 3.8a. When the sharp  metal tip is brought 
close  enough  to  the  sample  surface  (height  control  via  piezo-drives  (PZ)), 
electrons  can  tunnel  through  the  vacuum  barrier  between  tip  and  sample.  By 
applying  a  bias  voltage  on  the  sample,  a  tunneling  current  can  be  measured 
through the tip, which is exponentially sensitive to the distance between the tip 
and the surface. Therefore, the tip is usually < 1nm away from the sample. [186] 
By  using  two  other  piezo-drives  (PX  and  PY),  the  tip  scans  in  two  lateral 
dimensions. A feedback controller is employed to adjust the height of the tip to 
keep the tunneling current constant. During the tip scanning over the surface, 
the height of the tip (the voltage supplied to PZ) is recorded as an STM image, 
which represents the topography of the surface. Therefore, the topography does 
not  show  the  real  surface  structure  but  the  contours  of  a  constant  integrated 
LDOS at a certain distance from the sample. [184,186] This operation mode of 
STM is called “constant current” mode. Constant current mode is mostly used in 
STM topography imaging. It is safe to use the mode on rough surfaces since the 
distance between the tip and sample is adjusted by the feedback circuit. [184]  

On a smooth surface, it is also possible to keep the tip height constant above the 
surface;  then,  the  tunneling  current's  variation  reflects  the  small  atomic 
corrugation  of  the  surface.  This  “constant  height”  mode  has  no  fundamental 

39 

 
CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

difference to the “constant current” mode. However, the tip could be crashed if 
the surface corrugation is big. On the other hand, in this mode, the STM can scan 
very fast to research the surface dynamic processes. [184] 

Scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) is a versatile tool that provides valuable 
interrelated information about the local potential and spatial topography of the 
sample  on  the  nanoscale.  The  main  idea  of  the  STP  is  to  measure  the 
electrochemical potential (ECP) locally with the resolution of an STM. The basic 
principle of STP is shown in Figure 3.8b. In the STP setup, the samples are ex-
situ  contacted  with  two  gold  contacts  in  a  shadow  mask  procedure  such  that 
additional bias voltage VTransport can be applied, inducing an electric current (j) in 
the  sample  [187],  as  shown  in  Figure  3.8b.  The  STP  measurements  were 
performed at every image point by adjusting the ECP at the tip at  a fixed tip-
sample distance. The applied bias voltage is switched off for STP, while only the 
transport potential (VTransport) across the sample remains. The potential at the tip 
. Subsequently, the voltage 
is adjusted in a way that the tunneling current 

 necessary to compensate the net tunnel current is recorded in a

map, that is the STP map. This voltage

The  measurements  are  made  at  different  values  of  the  electron  current  in  the 
sample plane, especially at zero and forward and reversed current as defined by 
the  potential  applied  to  the  sample  contacts.  The  STP  measurements  were 
performed  to  evaluate  the  charge  transport  properties  in  graphene  samples, 
particularly  considering  the  resistance  anisotropy  on  the  local  scale,  as  are 
discussed in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

The scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) is a complementary technique that 
enables probing the LDOS of the sample. This is accomplished by measuring the 
current-to-voltage  characteristic  of  the  tunneling  junction,  see  Figure  3.8c. 
Practically,  an  STS  spectrum  (differential  conductance 
)  is  obtained 
using the tip, which is kept over a constant height above a distinct position on 
the surface. Then the feedback loop is disabled (leaving the tip-sample distance 
constant  during  spectroscopy),  and  the  tunneling  current 
  is  recorded  as  a 
function of the tunneling voltage 
 signal. Thus, in the simplest approximation, 
the  differential  conductance  is  approximately  proportional  to  the  energy-

3.6. Low-energy electron diffraction 

As  a  non-destructive  technique,  low  energy  electron  diffraction  (LEED)  is  a 
powerful  widely-used  method  for  surface  structural  analysis.  The  history  of 
LEED dated back to about 1924, when by derivation from Einstein’s well-known 
matter  and  energy  equation 
,  de  Broglie 
introduced his equation as follow: 

,  and  Planck’s  theory  E =

for the wavelength (λ) of an electron (e) with mass (m), momentum (p), energy 
(E), and h the Planck’s constant. The de Broglie’s postulation was experimentally 
observed  by  Davisson  and  Germer  (1927),  confirming  that  the  intensity 
distribution  of  low  energy  electron  backscattered  from  a  surface  obeys 
diffraction law. They studied the scattering of electrons from Ni (111) and found 
that the maximum in the reflected intensity of the elastically scattered electrons 
at any angle satisfied the plane grating formula (Bragg condition): 

n𝜆 = 𝛼 sin 𝜃 = 𝑑

41 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

where  α  is  the  spacing  between  adjacent  rows  of  atoms  and  λ  is  given  by  de 
Broglie relationship, and n is an integer (see Figure 3.9b). [192] Accordingly, the 
LEED  experiment  principle  is  not  very  complex,  as  schematically  is  shown  in 
Figure  3.9a.  A  primary  narrow  beam  of  monoenergetic  electrons  with  a  low 
energy range between 25 eV up to 600 eV (correspond to de Broglie wavelength 
of 0.5 to 2.5 Å, i.e., it is of the order of interatomic distances in a solid) is directed 
onto  a  planar  single  crystal  surface  at  a  given  angle  as  shown  in  Figure  3.9. 
Several  diffracted  beams  of  electrons  with  the  same  energy  as  the  incident 
(elastic)  beam  are  produced  in  the  backward  direction.  [193]  The  inelastically 
backscattered electrons are suppressed by the grids. The spatial distribution of 
these beams and their intensities as a function of the incident beam's angle and 
energy  (elastic)  provides  information  that  can  be  used  to  analyze  the  surface 
structure.  Moreover,  because  the  mean  free  path  of  low  energy  electrons  (as 
mentioned above) in a crystal is only a few angstroms, only the first few atomic 
layers will engage in the diffraction. This leads to no diffraction in the direction 
perpendicular to the sample surface. Thus, the reciprocal lattice of the surface is 
a 2D lattice with rods extending perpendicular from each lattice point, as shown 
in Figure 3.9a.

In  the  so-called  spot  profile  analysis  low-energy  electron  diffraction  (SPA-
LEED), the detection of diffracted electrons is done by a channeltron detector, 
unlike the standard LEED with a phosphorous screen. The SPA-LEED has the 
advantage of a larger accessible reciprocal space in contrast to the conventional 
LEED. This is due to electrostatic deflection plates that are used to continuously 
vary the angle of incidence of the electron beam in all directions at the sample 
position. Subsequently, scanning the incident angle of the electron beam results 
in a simultaneous variation of the angle under which diffracted electrons from 
the surface are recorded. This variation of both the incident and the exit angle of 
the electrons results in a very special scanning mode in reciprocal space, in which 
the angle between the incident and final scattering vector stays constant while 
the incident angle is changed. So, the Ewald sphere is rotated around the origin 
of reciprocal space,  resulting  in the recorded diffraction pattern not following 
the Ewald sphere (unlike the conventional LEED) but a sphere with twice as the 
diameter  of  the  Ewald  sphere.  [194]  The  SPA-LEED  images  are  akin  to  the 
conventional  LEED  images  but  contain  quantitative  information  of  the 
diffraction  spot  intensities  (e.g.,  peak  profiles)  and  much  higher  k-space 
resolution. 

The LEED measurements in this work were carried out by J. Aprojanz from the 
Leibniz University Hannover within the group of Prof. C. Tegenkamp.  

3.7. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a versatile quantitative spectroscopic 
technique that enables measuring the elemental composition, empirical formula, 
chemical state, and electronic state of the elements that exist within a material. 
XPS spectra are obtained by irradiating a material with a monochromatic photon 
beam  of  X-rays,  causing  the  sample  to  emit  electrons  (the  so-called 
photoelectrons) while simultaneously measuring the kinetic energy (EK) and the 
number of electrons that escape from approximately top 10 nm of the material 
being  analyzed.  A  basic  XPS  setup  consists  of  an  X-ray  source,  an  electron 
analyzer to measure the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, a detector to count 
the number of electrons, data acquisition, and a processing system. [195] Figure 
3.10  illustrates  the  XPS  working  principle  in  which  an  X-ray  photon  interacts 

43 

 
 
CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

with  a  core  level  electron  transferring  its  photon  energy  and  causing  electron 
emission by the photoelectric effect.  

The kinetic energy of the photoelectron (Ek) is the difference between the X-ray 
photon energy hυ (h is the Plank’s constant and υ is the X-ray frequency) and the 
binding energy (Eb) of the core-level electron. Since the X-ray energy is known 
and the Ek of the photoelectron can be experimentally determined, the Eb of the 
emitted electron is given by the following equation:

spec is the work function of the spectrometer. The Ek is measured in the

The XPS measurement and surface analysis  need to be performed in an ultra-
high  vacuum  environment  (<  10-9  Torr)  to  increase  the  mean  free  path  of  the 
photons  and  electrons,  remove  adsorbed  gases  from  the  sample  and  prevent 
adsorption of contaminants on the surface.  

The  XPS  measurements  presented  in  this  work  are  mainly  carried  out  on  so-
called intercalated buffer layer samples. This reveals valuable information about 
the sample and origin of intercalation, as is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. The 
XPS measurements were performed by Philip Schädlich from the University of 
Chemnitz  within  the  group  of  Prof.  T.  Seyller.  The  system  operates  with  a 
monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) sample spot size of about 2.5 mm2 
and a hemispherical Phoibos 150 MCD-9 analyzer (SPECS). Before XPS, samples 
were degassed at a maximum temperature of 

370 °C for 1 hour.

3.8. Low-energy electron microscopy  

The  low  energy  electron  microscopy  (LEEM)  is  a  technique  based  on  the 
principle of LEED. [196] The LEEM measurement relies on elastically reflected 
electrons created by a low-energy electron beam up to about 100 eV (frequently 
with less than 10 eV) acceleration voltage to image the sample. Due to the low 
energy  of  the  electron,  LEEM  is  a  highly  surface  sensitive  characterization 
technique. Therefore, it is a powerful tool to study SiC/G particularly, providing 
both insights into the local graphene coverage and thickness  using reflectivity 
spectra [23,197] as well as giving information about the local SiC stacking order 
through  dark-field  measurement.  [78,198–200]  The  latter  is  obtainable  in  the 
LEEM instrument since it is capable of imaging the diffraction pattern through 
an intermediate lens, thereby the LEED and dark field images can be captured.  

The schematic of a basic LEEM setup is shown in Figure 3.11. A focused electron 
beam with high energy (20 keV) is injected through the objective lens along its 
optical axis, which then shortly before reaching the sample is decelerated (in the 
cathode lens) to the desired low energy of a few eV. To be able to produce an 
image,  this  incident  beam  has  to  be  separated  from  the  reflected  beam  by  a 
magnetic  field  beam  divider  (separator).  The  elastically  back-scatted  electrons 
are again accelerated (~20 keV) and deflected into the imaging column (similar 
to an optical microscope) via the magnetic field. [201] A phosphorous screen is 
used  as  a  projection  plane  for  LEEM  imaging.  A  so-called  LEEM  bright-field 
(LEEM-BF) image is obtained using all back-reflected electrons for imaging. 

Moreover, LEEM enables studying an aerial contribution of a certain phase. This 
can  be  achieved  by  aligning  an  aperture  in  the  diffraction  spot,  allowing 
electrons  reflection  only  from  the  desired  phase.  Through  this  so-called  dark-
field  imaging  (LEEM-DF)  technique,  an  intensity  image  of  the  selected 
diffraction spot is achieved.  

The  same  experimental  setup  can  be  used  for  X-ray  photoemission  electron 
microscopy (XPEEM), which directly measures the work function variation on 
the surface.  [202]  In  this mode, the sample is illuminated  by light (X-ray) at a 
fixed energy level (hν), thereby the electrons from the atomic core level of the 
sample are excited, and they escape from the sample. These photoelectrons with 
certain kinetic energy equal to Ekin= hν − Ebin – ϕ are selected by the hemispherical 
energy analyzer to form an XPEEM image, where Ebin is the core level binding 
energy  and  ϕ  the  work  function.  The  XPEEM  measurement  in  this  work  was 
performed by Alexei A. Zakharov at the MAXIV laboratory. More information 
about the measurement setup can be found in ref. [203].

CHAPTER 3. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES 

Also, from the low-energy electron reflectivity (LEEM-IV), also known as LEEM-
IV  of  graphene  samples,  the  information  about  the  layer  thickness,  as  well  as 
interlayer distance, can be extracted. This can be perceived from the LEEM-IV 
spectra,  which  exhibit  a  dip  (local  minima)  whenever  the  electrons  can  be 
absorbed  by  an  unoccupied  state  of  the  sample.  This  happens  because  the 
confinement  of  electrons  in  thin  films  can  create  quantum  well  (QW)  bound 
states.  The  QW  states  at  discrete  energy  levels  produce  peaks  in  the 
photoemission energy spectrum or reflectivity of the low-energy electrons. The 
energy  levels  of  the  QW  states  change  with  the  film  thickness.  Therefore,  the 
photoemission  intensity  shows  an  oscillatory  behavior  as  a  function  of  the 
electron  energy  and  film  thickness,  in  which  the  number  of  dips  in  spectra 
corresponds to the number of graphene layers. For a detailed explanation, see 
refs. [23,197,204,205]. The LEEM-IV investigations of the graphene samples are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 7.  

The LEEM measurements in this work were carried out by P. Schädlich from the 
university of Chemnitz within the group of Prof. T. Seyller as well as by Alexei 
A. Zakharov at the MAXIV laboratory.

Angle-dependent  Nano-Four-Point  Probe 
transport 
measurement in a square configuration is used in this work to investigate a so-
called extrinsic resistance anisotropy of epitaxial SiC/G samples. This method, 
which  enables  electronic  transport  investigations  on  micrometer  scales,  also 
gives valuable information about the sheet resistance (intrinsic resistivity) of the 
sample. The measurement configuration of the N4PP on the graphene sample is 
shown in Figure 3.12. The setup includes four STM tips in a square arrangement, 
which are equally-spaced with a certain distance between the probes (in our case 
100  µm).  Two  probes  conduct  the  current  through  the  material,  and  the  two 
others, measure the voltage  difference.  The  N4PP  measurements  were  carried 
out for different angles between the direction of the current probes and the step 
edges.  The  angles  of  0°  and  180°  (90°)  correspond  to the  current  flow  parallel 
(perpendicular) to the steps (see Figure 3.12).

Because  the  current  flow  via  the  semi-insulating  SiC  substrate  and  the  buffer

on top. [207,208] 

The angle-dependent nano four-point probe (N4PP) measurements were taken 
in an Omicron UHV nanoprobe system. [209] The samples were kept in UHV at 
room temperature after a thermal cleaning procedure by heating up to 300 °C. 
The  position  adjustment  of  the  tips  on  the  sample  surface  was  carried  out  by 
helping  an  SEM,  positioned  on  the  right  top  of  the  STM  tips.  The  N4PP 
Measurements  were  performed  by  J.  Aprojanz  and  J.  Baringhaus,  J.  P. 
Stöckmann,  at  the  Leibniz  University  Hannover  within  the  group  of  Prof.  C. 
Tegenkamp.  

3.10. Van der Pauw measurement 

In addition to the above-discussed N4PP method, which enabled measurement 
on micrometer-scales, Van der Pauw (VdP) [210,211] is another four-point probe 
technique used in this work which allows transport measurements on large-scale 
graphene samples. Using the VdP, the sheet resistance (Rsh) can be measured. For 
a proper VdP measurement, the samples must have homogeneous resistivity (no 
anisotropy), and the contacts should be small and located at the periphery of the 
sample  that  could  be  arbitrarily  shaped  sample  but  with  a  uniform  thickness. 
Implementing the VdP measurement in a cryostat facilitates measuring charge 
carrier  concentration  (ns)  and  mobility  (µ)  of  the  sample  as  a  function  of 
temperature.  

The resistivity can be derived from a total of eight measurements configuration 
(see  Figure  3.13c)  that  are  made  around  the  edges  of  the  sample.  For  each 
measurement, the current is applied on two adjacent contacts, and voltage is read 
off from the two other opposite remaining contact pair, and the corresponding 
. From the entire 
resistance can be simply calculated using Ohm's law

resistivity divided by the thickness of the sample, and the sheet carrier density

shown in Figure 3.13d, the Hall voltage can be measured. As shown in Figure 
3.13d,  while  the  magnetic  field  switched  on,  the  current  is  applied  across  one 
diagonal,  and  the  voltage  is  measured  along  the  other  diagonal.  Then,  the 
polarity of the magnetic field is inverted, and a second measurement is carried 
out.  Thus,  each  measurement  is  made  twice  with  opposite  polarities  of  the 
magnetic 
to  eliminate  magnetoresistance 
contributions.  Reversing  the  current-flow  polarity  in  the  sample  allows  the 
removal  of  offset  and  thermoelectrical  voltages  [212].  The  Hall  coefficient  is

inferred from their ohmic (I/V) features. Moreover, in the case of measuring the 
SiC/G samples, it should be noticed that the graphene needs to be isolated from 
the graphene on the sidewalls and backside of the sample to assure the transport 
only in the top graphene layer, as shown in Figure 3.13b.

4.1. Reactor setup  

Figure 4.1 shows the horizontal inductively heated quartz-tube reactor used for 
graphene fabrication in this study. The specimens are placed in a susceptor that 
has  a  beveled  pocket  for  keeping  the  samples,  as  shown  in  Figure  4.1.  In  the 
pocket, the primary samples are surrounded by other dummy SiC samples for 
avoiding  the  possible  influence  of  the  sidewall  of  the  susceptor  at  high-
temperature annealing. The inductive heater can heat the susceptor to 2000 °C. 
The susceptor's temperature is continuously measured through a window with 
a pyrometer placed at one end of the reactor within a distance of approximately 
30 cm. An insulation layer of graphite surrounds the hot susceptor and reduces 
the  thermal  stress  of  the  quartz  glass  cylinder,  which  is  actively  cooled  with 
ambient air from the outside by a radial fan. The quartz tube is connected from 
one end to a turbopump and a scroll pump, which can evacuate the reactor down 
to a pressure of  ~4 ×  10
7 mbar at room temperature. Argon, nitrogen, and a 
mixture of argon/hydrogen (95% Ar and 5% H2) are three separate gases that can 
−
be led via different inlets to the chamber. Except for the flow rate of nitrogen gas, 
which is manually adjusted (usually for venting the system), the flow rate of two 
other gasses can be controlled automatically through the mass flow controllers. 
This  setup  was  also  used  for  the  hydrogen  intercalation  process.  The  setup  is 
automated  and  can  be  monitored  and  controlled  by  the  user  via  a  PC  based 
LabVIEW program. This reactor is based on a non-industrial design presented 
in ref. [213].  

4.2. Silicon carbide wafer specifications 

The  epitaxial  growth  was  performed  using  four-inch  4H-  and  6H-SiC  wafers 
from II-VI GmbH Deutschland. The wafers with a thickness of 500 ±25
m were 
mostly  semi-insulating  (vanadium  compensating  dopants,  R > 109 
-cm), 
μ
classified as prime grade (micro-pipe density <10 cm
2), with epi-ready chemical 
mechanical  polishing  (CMP)  on  the  silicon  face  and  optical  polishing  on  the 
−
carbon face. The growth was carried out on the silicon face. Wafers with various 
miscut angles towards different crystal orientations were used for the growth. 
For graphene growth, the SiC wafers were cut into samples typically with the 
sizes of 5 × 10 mm2 and 10 × 10 mm2 (see Figure 4.2) using an automatic dicing 
saw  (DAD3220_DISCO)  in  the  cleanroom  at  the  Physikalisch-Technische 
Bundesanstalt (PTB). The dicing trenches were aligned up parallel to the primary 
and secondary flats of the wafers. This adjustment was made while mounting 
the wafer on the spindle.

face of the wafers was covered by an adhesive protection foil to protect it during 
the dicing process. The foil coverage was done carefully to avoid any trapping 
air bubbles between the foil and the wafer. The dicing was carried out on the C-
face. The dicing parameters were chosen with appropriate care for avoiding any 
damage to the expensive wafers. The cutting depth was adjusted to be about 60 
percent of the wafer’s thickness, facilitating easy sample splitting.

After  finishing  the  dicing  procedure,  the  samples  could  be  easily  split  using 
tweezers. To identify the samples, they were named by a letter and a number, 
e.g., A7 and A8 shown in Figure 4.2, written on the backside (carbon-side or C-
side). Also, the letter “L” was scribed on the lower-left edge of each sample on 
its C-face, which helps to identify the crystal orientation, i.e., long and short sides 
of  the  ‘’L’’  is  parallel  to  the  secondary  flat  (

4.3. Hydrogen etching 

The surface quality of SiC is decisive to achieve large-area homogenous epitaxial 
graphene.  Hydrogen  etching  or  cleaning  is  a  technique  for  providing  flat  SiC 
surfaces. High cleaning efficiency is an advantage of this technique, which is the 
main  reason  to  be  applied  as  a  pre-treatment  step  for  epitaxial  film  growth. 
Hydrogen etching  was formerly often used  to remove  scratches and damages 
arising  from  the  cutting  and  polishing  processes.  Development  in  SiC  surface 
preparation has led to producing wafers with almost no scratches. However, it 
is still beneficial for surface cleaning, removing contaminations, and obtaining 
atomically flat surfaces.

process as a function of

especially the step-
bunching.

CHAPTER 4. FABRICATION PROCESS 

For  example,  the  SiC  specimens  after  dicing  (described  in  section  4.2)  usually 
contain  considerable  contaminations,  especially  when  for  the  protection  a 
durable adhesive foil or photoresist coating is used. Such contaminations stick 
to  the  surface,  and  it  is  challenging  to  be  removed  by  standard  cleaning 
procedures, i.e., acetone cleaning. Here, hydrogen etching plays a significant role 
in  surface  cleaning.  The  hydrogen  flow-rate  and  process  temperature  are  two 
critical parameters in the etching. Depending on the etching parameters, often 
well-shaped  regular  but  strongly  step-bunched  terraces  are  obtained.  Heavily 
step-bunched surfaces are detrimental to graphene growth.  

However,  it  is  possible  to  combine  the  advantages  of  the  hydrogen-etching  if 
certain parameters in the process are  considered. Hydrogen etching  processes 
were intensively studied in previous works and can be found in  refs. [37,148]. 
The diagram shown in Figure 4.3a demonstrates the typical hydrogen etching 
process leading to smooth surfaces, as seen in Figure 4.3b. Moreover, a modified 
process, named hydrogen-cleaning, was used to clean the graphene oven before 
the main graphene growth. While hydrogen etching is a short process to obtain 
smooth SiC surfaces, the hydrogen-cleaning is applied to clean the oven. This is 
critical  in  the  reproducible  fabrication  of  graphene,  especially  if  the  reactor  is 
contaminated.  

4.4. Polymer-assisted sublimation growth 

An  advanced,  so-called  polymer-assisted  sublimation  growth  (PASG)  method 
was used to produce graphene on SiC. This technique  could be regarded as a 
modification of standard conventional SiC sublimation growth combined with 
an additional carbon source. Accordingly, the growth is not based only upon the 
graphenization  of  the  SiC  through  thermal  treatment  and  subsequent  Si 
sublimation but also is supported from a foreign carbon-rich source via polymer 
adsorbates added to the samples. The PASG effectively suppresses the inherent 
but  unfavorable  formation  of  high  SiC  surface  terrace  steps  during  high-
temperature sublimation growth. This happens through a rapid formation of the 
graphene  buffer  layer,  which  stabilizes  the  SiC  surface.  The  growth  has  gone 
through multiple optimizations that will be discussed in this work as also have 
been  addressed  in  refs.  [36–39].  In  the  following,  the  sample  preparation  and 
PASG growth are described. 

The sample preparation comprises two main successive treatments. First, the SiC 
specimens require to be cleaned from contaminations and then be polymerized 
for the PASG. The applied cleaning process has two sub-steps: firstly storing the 
SiC  specimens  in  an  acetone  beaker  (Si-face  up)  for  at  least  48  hours,  and 
secondly immersing the samples in a fresh mixture of isopropanol and acetone 

57 

CHAPTER 4. FABRICATION PROCESS 

(1:3) and introducing to an ultrasonic bath (USB) for 15 minutes (at 40 °C). A USB 
equipped  with  the  ability  of  temperature  and  power  adjustments  is  indeed 
highly  favorable.  For  the  cleaning,  ultra-pure  isopropanol  and  acetone  were 
used.  It  worth  mentioning  that  the  cleaning  was  investigated  using  different 
methods and chemicals, e.g., hydrogen fluoride (HF), piranha, RCA (SC1/SC2) 
method, and other known techniques introduced in different studies. [214–216] 
However,  the  experiments  showed  that  the  abovementioned  simple  cleaning 
process was sufficiently efficient for obtaining clean samples. 

After cleaning, the polymerization process was achieved by an easy-to-use so-
called  liquid-phase  deposition  (LPD)  technique.  [37]  The  LPD  polymerization 
was applied using a mixture of pure AZ5214E photoresist diluted in isopropanol 
(5ml/25 ml). The LPD process with three sub-steps is depicted in Figure 4.4a. For 
the LPD, the samples are first immersed in a beaker containing diluted AZ5214E 
photoresist and introduced to the USB for 15 min at 40 °C. This step is followed 
by  rinsing  the  sample  for  ~45  seconds  using  an  isopropanol  wash  bottle  to 
remove the excess polymer from the surface. Right  after that, the samples are 
dried  by  spin-drying  at  a  speed  of  ~6000  rpm  (30  seconds),  which  could  be 
supported by a simultaneous nitrogen gas blow on the sample. All the processes 
were carried out in the cleanroom conditions in the yellow area. The LPD results 
in uniform distribution of nano-sized polymer adsorbate on the surface, which 
is  crucial  for  the  growth  homogeneity.  The  polymer  could  also  be  applied 
directly on the surface by spin-coating; however, it often leads to a non-uniform 
distribution  of  adsorbates  resulting  in  irreproducible  and  inhomogeneous 
graphene growth with bilayer inclusions. [217,218]

  1.0  ×  10

For the prepared specimens, the growth procedure begins with a cleaned and 
evacuated  (P 
6  mbar)  reactor.  The  oven  cleaning  usually  includes 
several successive steps, e.g., hydrogen cleaning, vacuum cleaning, and cleaning 
−
in  argon  ambient.  Each  of  the  steps  has  several  temperature  windows  with 
varying  the  applied  gas  flow.  The  samples  are  mounted  into  the  susceptor 
(Figure 4.1b), then it is loaded into the oven. The diagram in Figure 4.4b shows 
the growth process for the graphene monolayer fabrication. The complex growth 
has  three  initial  annealing  steps  at  lower  temperatures  of  900  °C  (vacuum,  30 
min), 1200 °C (Ar atmosphere, 900 mbar, 10 min), and 1400 °C (Ar atmosphere, 
900 mbar, 2 min) before  the graphene growth at 1750 °C (Ar atmosphere,  900 
mbar, 6 min). During the temperature ramp, an intermediate interruption of the 
growth process was performed by cooling the system to room temperature after 
 1.0 × 10
initial annealing in a vacuum (P 
7 mbar, 900°C, 30min). The system 
then was vented by introducing argon gas to change the pressure to ~900 mbar.

CHAPTER 4. FABRICATION PROCESS 

This additional cooling step was performed for two main reasons: (i) avoiding 
the  possible  influence  of  the  argon  flow-rate  on  the  sample  during  pressure 
change  (vacuum  to  ~900  mbar),  (ii)  increasing  the  carbon  condensation  and 
nucleation sites on the SiC surface for accelerated buffer layer growth. [37] The 
process was followed by intermediate annealing at 1200 °C and 1400 °C for 10 
and 2 minutes, respectively. Afterward, the samples were heated directly up to 
1750 °C and annealed (6 min) while the argon flow-rate was kept at zero sccm. 
All  the  temperature  ramps  were  applied  at  the  same  heating  rate  of  ~7  °C/s. 
Finally, the heater was switched off, and the samples were allowed to cool down 
to ~400 °C (no Ar flow), then to room temperature under Ar flow of 500 sccm.  

Furthermore, by proper thermal treatments, homogenous bilayer graphene can 
be  achieved,  although  the  graphene  growth  on  SiC(0001)  is  known  to  be  self-
limiting.  This  is  acquired  by  the  same  recipe  shown  in  Figure  4.4b,  but  the 
growth  at  1750  °C  is  extended  to  about  one  hour  and  several  temperature 
windows up to 2000 °C. The results will be discussed in Chapter 5.  

Figure 4.4c shows the diagram of a buffer layer growth. This process results in 
outstanding  buffer  layer  coverage  appealing  for  intercalation  purposes  to 
achieve  coherent  QFMLG  layers  or  fabrication  of  other  sub-dimensional 
materials. This growth is special since it implements the Ar flow-rate as a growth 
utensil in combination with other parameters. It is an alternative growth recipe, 
and similar results were achieved by manipulating and optimizing other growth 
parameters. The results will be discussed in Chapter 5 and can also be found in 
refs. [38]. 

The  growth  optimization  was  carried  out  on  more  than  1200  samples  types, 
which  statistically  underline  the  successful  reproducibility  of  graphene 
syntheses.  The  presented  fabrication  method  and  optimization  enables  the 
growth  of  ultra-smooth  bilayer-free  graphene  sheets  with  unprecedented 
reproducibility,  a  prerequisite  for  the  wafer-scale  fabrication  of  high-quality 
graphene-based electronic devices.  

4.5. Device fabrication 

In this section, the general lithography process applied to pattern graphene into 
an  electronic  device  is  described.  Here,  the  primary  fabrication  technique  is 
based  on  electron  beam  lithography  (EBL)  to  define  the  patterns  on  epitaxial 
graphene.  Alternatively,  photolithography  is  also  possible,  but  because  of  its 
lower  resolution  is  not  preferred  in  this  study  and  thus  is  not  used.  The 
lithography  process  begins  when  the  graphene  sample  has  passed  initial 
inspection  using  an  optical  microscope,  AFM,  and  sometimes  Raman 

60 

CHAPTER 4. FABRICATION PROCESS 

spectroscopy.  The  fabrication  produce  is  technically  composed  of  three 
successive steps, as illustrated in Figure 4.5a. 

In  the  first  step,  the  contacts  and  markers  are  structured.  To  this  end,  the 
graphene is covered with an EBL compatible photoresist using spin coating. The 
bottom  layer,  closest  to  the  graphene,  consists  of  a  poly(methyl-methacrylate) 
(PMMA) based copolymer, and the top layer consists of ARP 630-670 series (e.g., 
P672.06).  These  are  both  positive  resists,  which  become  soluble  in  specific 
developers upon exposure to the electron beams. Furthermore, these two resists 
are sensitive with different ratios to the developers, which facilitates control over 
the  resist  profile.  Additionally,  a  20  nm  chromium  layer  is  evaporated  on  the 
sample.  This  thin  reflective  chromium  layer  helps  to  overcome  the  EBL’s 
focusing  problem  on  the  transparent  SiC/epitaxial  graphene.  After  EBL 
illumination,  the  chromium  layer  is  removed.  Then,  the  exposed  areas  are 
developed.  Next,  the  graphene  is  structured  by  AC-plasma  using  an 
oxygen/argon  gas  mixture.  Since  graphene  adherence  to  any  deposited  metal 
(e.g., Au) is weak, therefore, in this step, areas where metal bond pads (anchors) 
are placed will also be etched to allow bonding to the SiC substrate. The first step 
also includes the etching of the markers (at the corners) to help precise alignment 
of future layers. After the plasma etching, the PMMA mask is lifted. 

The  structured  graphene  is  then  contacted  by  Ti/Au  metal  contacts.  The  thin 
titanium sticks very well to the etched areas (SiC) and is sealed by the gold layer 
to avoid oxidation. These two layers act as a coupling agent between the final 
gold overlap layer and the SiC substrate. Titanium does not show proper contact 
with graphene, so it is not directly deposited onto the graphene. In the second 
step,  the  graphene  Hall-bar  is  structured  by  EBL  illumination  on  two-layers 
positive photoresists A-RP 630-670 series and atop SX AR-PC 5000/90.2 (Electra 
92) layer. The latter resist is electrically conductive and is required for an efficient 
EBL illumination. Afterward, the Electra 92 is developed under flowing distilled 
water,  and  the  exposed  areas  of  the  photoresist  are  developed  by  the  same 
procedure described in the first step. 

In the third step, the electronic contact with the graphene is realized. The EBL is 
applied to the sample covered with the same two photoresists (as described in 
the first step) to open a window (by a developer) for the metallization of the gold 
contacts.  With  a  thickness  of  50  nm,  this  gold  layer  overlaps  the  previously 
deposited Ti/Au contacts and the nearby uncovered graphene. Figure 4.5 depicts 
the graphene Hall bar with two main sizes of either (100 × 400 µm2) or (200 × 
800 µm2) designed and used for the QHE measurements presented in Chapter 8. 
For  the  measurements,  the  samples  are  glued  to  a  chip  carrier,  e.g.,  TO8,  as 
shown in Figure 4.5, bonded using an aluminum wire wedge bonder from West

Bond  Inc.  The  lithography  process  of  the  graphene  devices  was  performed 
mainly based on an optimized approach developed by A. Müller. [219] 

For the Van der Pauw measurements, the samples are mainly measured without 
any prior lithography, as explained in Chapter 3. However, for better contacting, 
which enables multiple measurements (without damaging the graphene in VdP 
setup) and avoiding durable typical EBL procedures, an easy and innovative so-
called  pen-patterning  method  was  used  to  generate  fast  contacting  to  the 
graphene samples. This technique is briefly explained in Appendix A1.

4.6. Charge carrier tuning 

Notwithstanding  several  existing  methods,  precise  control  over  the  charge 
carrier  density  in  SiC/G  is  still  a  delicate  task  to  accomplish.  For  the  QHE 
applications, it is desirable to tune the graphene close to the charge neutrality 
condition (EF = ED) that enables reaching high electron mobility and quantization 
at low magnetic fields. This section presents two of those methods to tune the 
graphene Hall-bars.

The first method, the so-called photochemical gating, is based on the chlorinated 
photosensitive 
acrylate), 
commercially available as ZEP520. The photo-gateable heterostructure is formed 
by spin-coating the sample with 55 nm PMMA as a neutral spacer layer followed 
by a deposition of 300 nm ZEP520, as shown in Figure 4.6a. A deep ultraviolet 
light (DUV) illumination with a wavelength of ≤ 254 nm activates the ZEP520A 
layer  and  generates  an  electric  field  above  the  graphene,  which  leads  to  the 
gating effect. Through the DUV exposure, the chemical bonding in the ZEP520 
polymers  is  changed,  which  results  in  the  formation  of  Cl  radicals  acting  as 
effective electron acceptors. [220] These acceptors can take the electrons from the 
lower-lying graphene layer. By varying the dose (increasing illumination time), 
the density of acceptors increases, and the electron concentration in the graphene 
can be gradually reduced. By this technique, the electron density in the graphene 
can  be  reduced  from  several  1012  cm
2 to  about  1010  cm
2.  After  the 
measurements, the sample can be illuminated again, or the carrier concentration 
−

can  be  restored  to  its  original  value  by  heating  the  device  above  the  polymer 
glass transition temperature of Tg ≈ 170 °C. [220] 

Alternatively, a high electrostatic potential gating with ions can be produced by 
corona discharge for a reversible tuning of the SiC/G carrier density. To this end, 
the  sample  first  needs  to  be  covered  with  a  dielectric  PMMA  layer  as  a  host 
material  for  the  ions  generated  by  the  corona  discharge  gun.  This  can  be 
regarded as similar to the metallic gate of a field-effect transistor (FET) that is 
replaced  by  the  ions  deposited  on the  dielectric  layer,  which  induce  a  surface 
charge density on the underlying semiconductor.  

Corona discharge can be created by applying a high voltage to a sharp tip or wire 
to generate an electrical discharge that ionizes the surrounding gas. If performed 
 which move along the 
in air, the predominant ionic species are 
lines of the electric field. When a negative voltage is applied, positive ions drift 
towards  the  discharge  source,  while  negative  species  propagate  away  from  it 
and are deposited on a target substrate and vice versa. [221]

The  carrier density control of SiC/G samples was  performed through a piezo-
activated antistatic gun (Zerostat) similar  to ref. [221] with two distinctions in 
the  measurement  setup  and  ambient  condition.  Figure  4.6b  depicts  the 
measurement  configuration  in  which  half  of  the  contacts  are  connected  to  a 
positive DC voltage (red color cabling), and the other half are grounded (blue 
color cabling) while the current is measured. This, in addition to replacing the 
DC  current  source  with  a  DC  voltage  source,  assures  the  safety  of  the  device 
during  the  measurements  and  charge  spikes.  Furthermore,  the  tuning  was 
carried out  in the presence  of a  gentle nitrogen flow  (5N) that  experimentally 
turned out to be resulting in higher stability of charge tuning compared to when 
performing  the  tuning  in  air.  The  corona  discharge  gun  produces  a  1  to  2-sec 
long  pulse  of  positive  or  negative  ions  with  the  polarity  depending  on  the 
compression  or  expansion  of  the  piezo-crystal.  The  variation  in  the  electronic 
properties  of  SiC/G  during  exposure  to  the  corona  ions  is  monitored 
continuously  by  measuring  the  current  flow  in  the  sample.  Figure  4.6c 
demonstrates the resistance change of a SiC/G sample under investigation. By 
each pulse of ions, the carrier concentration of SiC/G, which is initially n-doped, 
can  be  tuned  close  to  the  Dirac  point  or  be  doped  towards  hole  doping, 
depending on the number of ion pulses. By comparing the experimental data of 
doping  in  SiC/G,  the  observed  maximum  in  the  measured  resistances 
corresponds to the Dirac point, indicating the cross-over from n- to p-doping. As 
will be discussed in Chapter 8, the aim is to keep the electron doping with fine 
adjustment close to the Dirac point for QHE measurements.  

Also,  it  is  worthwhile  to  mention  that  a  so-called  post-treatment  such  as 
hydrogen-treatment  or  air-annealing  (see  Appendix  A2)  is  applied  to  the 
samples to modify the doping level and will also be discussed in Chapter 8.

5. High growth control of epitaxial graphene on SiC 

Abstract 

T 

his  chapter  focuses  on  the  fabrication  of  graphene  on  the  silicon-face  of 
hexagonal  silicon  carbide.  Over  1200  samples  of  different  types  were 
synthesized  to  optimize  the  growth  and  its  reproducibility.  Here  the  most 
important results are discussed. This chapter gives a comprehensive overview of 
the growth of a so-called buffer layer (BFL), monolayer graphene (MLG), bilayer 
graphene (BLG), and quasi-freestanding monolayer/ bilayer (QFMLG/ QFBLG) 
layers.  The  high  quality  of  these  layers  helps  to  better  understand  the  growth 
kinetics and mechanism, a so-called step-bunching, and surface restructuring and 
recrystallization. The large-scale homogeneity of the samples enables both local- 
and  macro-scale  studies  on  different  sample  types  resulting  in  several  salient 
features in epigraphene that each thematically will be discussed separately in the 
following chapters (i.e., 5, 6, and 7). In this chapter, the optimization of the growth 
considering an influential but so-far neglected parameter, the “argon gas flow-
rate,”  is  addressed.  The  conditions  for  the  fabrication  of  epitaxial  BFL  are 
studied.  Subsequently,  the  main  challenges  in  BFL  growth:  the  poor  or 
excessive- “coverage”  at  the  SiC  step-edge  regions,  which  both  dramatically 
degrade the quality of the BFL sample, are discussed. In addition to high-quality 
MLG, the growth conditions to achieve coherent and scalable epitaxial BLG are 
presented.  Also,  the  challenges  and  efficiency  of  the  intercalation  technique 
concerning the intercalant purity and intercalation conditions are studied. Several 
characterization  techniques  such  as  AFM,  Raman  spectroscopy,  XPS,  LEED, 
VdP, and STM are used to examine the samples. The presented results are partly 
published in refs. [36–39,118,148]. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 5. HIGH GROWTH CONTROL OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE ON SIC 

5.1. Introduction 

Inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) counter-pressure has been used for many years 
to  improve  silicon  carbide  sublimation  growth,  which  prevents  unwanted 
crystal growth before reaching the optimal growth temperature.  [222,223] The 
growth  of  epitaxial  graphene  in  an  argon  atmosphere  of  elevated  pressure  of 
about 1bar was a breakthrough in the progress of obtaining high-quality large-
area graphene layers. [16,17] However, little attention has been paid to the gas 
flow velocity of the ambient process gas. However, the presented results in this 
study show that  the SiC decomposition rate can be controlled through the Ar 
flow-rate without varying the total pressure and substrate temperature. Herein 
the focus is initially drawn on the impact of argon flow-rate on optimization and 
improvement in growing epitaxial buffer- and graphene layers. By taking into 
account the influence of the argon flow-rate, optimization of growth parameters, 
and modification of a so-called polymer-assisted growth technique is achieved, 
and ultra-smooth bilayer-free graphene layers are produced. [36–39,118,148] 

The QFMLG can be fabricated by decoupling an epitaxially grown buffer layer 
from the underlying SiC substrate, e.g., via hydrogen intercalation. [18,108,224] 
The hydrogen intercalation allows the fabrication of p-type monolayer graphene 
combined  with  the  advantage  of  the  large-scale  graphene  epitaxial  growth 
directly  on  semi-insulating  SiC  substrates  with  reduced  influence  on  the  atop 
graphene layer. [16,108,119,121] Hence, this approach offers a versatile platform 
for potential applications as an alternative to epitaxial graphene (EG) with n-type 
charge  carriers  in  the  pristine  state.  This  has  prompted  various  interesting 
experimental 
elements. 
[18,96,99,101,109,225–227]  

applying  different 

intercalation 

studies  by 

State-of-the-art  QFMLG  can  be  fabricated  with  high  quality  proven  by  low 
defect-related D-peak intensities in local Raman measurements and high charge 
carrier  mobilities  in  transport  measurements  of  micrometer-sized  Hall  bars. 
[108,228,229]  However,  it  is  quite  challenging  to  obtain  homogenous  QFMLG 
over mm or cm areas, as can be obtained with EG. [36,37,39,148] An important 
reason is the lower temperature used for buffer layer growth (about 1400 °C, ~1 
bar) compared to graphene growth (> 1600 °C, ~1 bar) which limits the carbon 
supply and surface mass transport and thus, the formation of a coherent large-
area buffer layer. Such problems are often observed at the SiC step-edge region 
where the sublimation rate is strongly enhanced. [230] Moreover, hexagonal SiC 
shows terraces with inequivalent surface energies and decomposition velocities 
[133,141], which complicates the epitaxial growth concerning thickness control 
and coverage. Due to these facts, either incomplete buffer layer coverage (at low 
growth temperatures) [36] or additional graphene-layer formation (at elevated 

67 

CHAPTER 5. HIGH GROWTH CONTROL OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE ON SIC 

growth  temperatures)  [119,120,231]  are  common  ramifications  at  step  edges. 
Practically,  such  defected  buffer  layers  prevent  a  reproducible  fabrication  of 
large-area  homogeneous  QFMLG,  which  is  unfavorable  regarding  electronic 
device fabrication, e.g., for achieving superior transistor performance with high 
cut-off frequency [117], quantum Hall metrology applications [19,36,39,232] and 
even beyond that for growing other 2D materials. [43,105] 

This chapter is organized as follows: first, the influence of the mass flow-rate of 
argon,  which is used  as an inert atmosphere  for the epitaxial buffer layer and 
graphene  growth  processes,  is  investigated.  Subsequently,  the  ultra-smooth 
buffer  layer  and  graphene  monolayer  fabrication  by  taking  into  account  the 
effect  of  the  Ar  flow-rate  in  combination  with  other  determining  growth 
parameters  (e.g.,  T,  p)  is  presented.  These  are  supported  by  atomic  force 
microscopy  (AFM)  and  Raman  spectroscopy  investigations,  which  prove  that 
optimized Ar mass flow conditions lead to the formation of highly homogenous 
buffer  or  graphene  layers,  and  after  intercalation  to  high-quality  large-area 
QFMLG  and  QFBLG,  respectively.  The  intercalation  conditions  regarding  the 
gas  impurity,  time,  and  temperature  are  studied  and  discussed.  The  STM 
measurements demonstrate the freestanding graphene layers smoothly bridge 
over the SiC steps on the adjacent terraces. This is further supported by mm-scale 
Van  der  Pauw  (VdP)  as  well  as  μm-scale  nano-four-point  probe  (N4PP) 
measurements of millimeter-sized samples  with high charge  carrier mobilities 
up  to  1300  and  3300  (cm2/Vs)  for  QFMLG  and  QFBLG,  respectively,  at  room 
temperature.  [38,233]  Finally,  the  graphene  growth  is  pursued,  aiming  at 
homogenous  epitaxial  bilayer  graphene  fabrication.  Accordingly,  the  growth 
conditions  are  discussed,  and  the  quality  of  the  samples  is  scrutinized  using 
AFM, Raman, and STM measurements.  

5.2. Sample preparation 

The  experiments  (Exp.1-Exp.7)  were  performed  on  the  Si-face  of  the  samples 
(5 × 10 mm2) cut from a semi-insulating 4H- and 6H-SiC wafer with a nominal 
. The substrates were prepared by liquid 
miscut of about 
phase  deposition  of  polymer  adsorbates  on  the  surface  as  described  for  the 
polymer assisted sublimation growth (PASG) technique described in Chapter 4 
and refs. [36–39]

The  influence  of  Ar  mass  flow-rate  on  the  buffer  layer  growth  (Exp.1)  is 
exemplary shown on three samples S0, S100, and S1000. After vacuum annealing at 
900 °C, the buffer layer was grown at 1400 °C (900 mbar Ar atmosphere, 30 min) 
under  Ar  mass  flow  rates  of  0  (zero),  100,  and  1000  sccm,  respectively.  The 

68 

 
CHAPTER 5. HIGH GROWTH CONTROL OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE ON SIC 

process  diagram  is  shown  in  Figure  5.2c.  Since  the  surface  diffusion  is  highly 
temperature-dependent,  studying  the  influence  of  argon  flux  on  surface 
morphology can be more effectively investigated for the opted low temperature 
(1400°C) than graphene growth temperatures (above 1500°C, 1000 mbar). This is 
demonstrated in section 5.3.1. 

The  impact  of  the  Ar  mass  flow-rate  on  the  graphene  growth  (Exp.2)  was 
demonstrated on two samples G0 and G20 grown at 1750 °C (Ar atm., 900 mbar, 
6 min), under zero, and 20 sccm Ar mass flow, respectively. All other parameters 
were kept constant. (See section 5.3.2) 

The  optimized  buffer  layer  sample  BFL1  (Exp.3)  was  grown  under  0  sccm  Ar 
flow (900 mbar) by an annealing procedure with temperature steps at 1400 °C (8 
min), 1500 °C (5 sec), 1300 °C (2 min), and 800 °C (1 min). The detailed process 
diagram can be seen in Figure 4.4b. The BFL2 represents, in contrast, a weakly 
covered buffer layer sample, which was grown at 1400 °C for 5 min (900 mbar). 
Comparing  the  quality  of  the  BFL1  and  BFL2  explicitly  demonstrates  the 
significance of growth optimization, especially when homogenous freestanding 
monolayer graphene is desired. This is compared in Exp.4, which includes the 
application of H-intercalation on two buffer layer samples with different quality 
(BFL1  and  BFL2)  which  are  afterward  named  QFMLG1  and  QFMLG2, 
respectively. The hydrogen intercalation was conducted at 900 °C (60 min). This 
is discussed in section 5.4. 

Next, it is shown that the buffer layer samples can be surprisingly intercalated 
in a nitrogen environment with 99.999% purity. This is demonstrated in Exp5., 
which includes stepwise buffer layer intercalation processes in nitrogen (5N) and 
hydrogen environments separately and subsequent investigations using Raman 
spectroscopy. For this purpose, the intercalation of the buffer layer samples was 
performed from ~300 to ~1000 °C with temperature increments of 100 °C. This 
is discussed in section 5.5.3. 

Similarly, quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) was shown (Exp.6) by 
H-intercalation on G0 (epigraphene) at 1050 °C (2 hours). The intercalation was 
done in hydrogen (5%) and argon (95%) gas mixture (1000 mbar). The optimal 
temperature  was  determined  by  Raman  spectroscopy  and  large-scale  VdP 
measurements.  

Finally, the epitaxial bilayer graphene (Exp.7) was grown at several temperature 
windows of 1750 °C (10 min), 1850 °C (30 min), and 1900 °C (10 sec) at 900 mbar 
in  an  argon  atmosphere.  All  the  samples  in  this  study  are  listed  in  Table  5.1, 
including the main growth parameters. More details can be found in Chapter 4.

5.3. Influence of argon flow-rate 

5.3.1. Ar flow-rate in buffer layer growth  

The surface morphology of the buffer layer samples grown under different Ar 
mass  flow  rates  (S0,  S100,  and  S1000)  are  plotted  in  Figure  5.1  (see  the  process 
diagram in Figure 5.2). Figure 5.1a and b show for sample S0 (zero Argon flow) 
a smooth surface with regular terraces and step heights of ~0.75 nm. The clear 
(6
3)R30°  spot  profile  analysis  low-energy  electron  diffraction  (SPA-
LEED) pattern in Figure 5.1c indicates the formation of the buffer layer which 
homogeneously  covers  the  terraces  as  shown  by  the  even  phase  contrast.  The 
homogenous buffer layer growth is attributed to the PASG growth, which favors 
buffer layer nucleation over the entire terrace. [36,37]  

3  ×  6

√

√

The different phase contrasts (lighter colors) along the step edges (see inset in 
Figure 5.1b) are ascribed to two different effects. The bright-line originates from 
the  local  phase  shift  induced  by  the  topographical  difference  in  height.  The 
narrow stripes of light contrast around the step edges are attributed to material 
contrast which could originate from uncovered SiC areas or already graphene 
domains.  Since  graphene  growth  is  rather  unlikely  at  the  low  growth 
temperature of 1400 °C [36], an inferior buffer layer growth at the step edges is 

70 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 5. HIGH GROWTH CONTROL OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE ON SIC 

assumed. The  missing buffer  layer coverage along the step edges indicates an 
insufficient carbon supply in these areas, which is attributed to carbon diffusion 
and preferred buffer layer nucleation on the terraces. These line defects separate 
the  buffer  layer  areas  on  neighboring  terraces,  which  is  unsuitable  for  the 
fabrication of large-area QFMLG through intercalation. 

√

For  100  sccm  Ar  flow,  the  surface  morphology  changes.  Although  the 
(6
3)R30° LEED pattern indicates the formation of the buffer layer on the 
terraces, Figure 5.1f, the AFM images of sample S100 in Figure 5.1d, and e show 
that the smooth terraces are interrupted by canyon-like defects which erode into 
the SiC terraces and terminate at the following terrace step. These canyon-defects 
are known to form at gaps in the buffer layer. [234,235] Here, the increased Ar 
flow rate alters locally the thickness and homogeneity of the near-surface layer 
of species (Knudsen layer)  [236,237] during the growth, where it causes a faster 
local  SiC  decomposition  and  surface  mass  diffusion,  leading  to  the  canyon-
defects before a continuous buffer layer has formed on the terraces.  

For much higher Ar flows (Figure 5.1g and h), the accelerated SiC decomposition 
induces an etching of the SiC surface. No buffer layer can be formed under these 
conditions, as indicated by the (1×1) LEED pattern of the bare SiC surface, Figure 
5.1i. The AFM image of S1000 in Figure 5.1g shows wide terraces and pronounced 
terrace broadening and step bunching with step heights of ~2.5 nm. Nanometer-
sized islands with a triangular-shaped basal plane and heights about ~5.5 nm 
are  frequently  observed  on  the  surface.  [38]  A  similar  Ar  flow  dependence 
behavior was observed for typical sublimation growth (SG) without using the 
PASG technique. [37,38] 

The  investigations  show  that  with  increasing  Ar  mass  flow,  the  SiC  surface 
decomposition is enhanced while the Ar pressure in the reactor is kept constant. 
This can be understood in a model in which a quasi-thermal equilibrium exists 
between  Si  and  C  species  in  a  surface  layer  and  those  in  the  adjoining  gas 
phase.[236,237] For higher Ar flow, the species in the gas phase are increasingly 
“blown  away”  by  collision  processes  with  the  Ar  atoms.  This  perturbation 
enforces  enhanced  SiC  decomposition  to  maintain  the  equilibrium.  The 
decomposition process competes with the buffer layer growth since the C-rich 
surface reconstruction is known to stabilize the SiC surface by the covalent bonds 
in-between. [36,235] The final state of the surface is determined by the rates of 
the involved processes. 

For zero and small Ar flows, the slow SiC decomposition is self-limiting by the 
generated carbon for buffer layer growth. For a high Ar flow, when a fast SiC 
decomposition rate exceeds the nucleation and growth rate of the buffer layer, 
an  etching  of  the  SiC  surface  is  the  consequence.  Both  extreme  cases  are 

71 

CHAPTER 5. HIGH GROWTH CONTROL OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE ON SIC 

displayed by the samples S0 and S1000, respectively. For moderate Ar flow both, 
etching  and  buffer  layer  growth  can  appear  simultaneously  but  spatially 
separated as seen for S100. The control of the SiC decomposition by the Ar mass 
flow  without  changing  process  temperature  or  the  Ar  background  pressure 
opens a new parameter range for improved epitaxial graphene growth.

inset (1.2 × 1.2 µm2) in (b) shows a close-up of a line defect of sample S0: The lighter narrow

This  situation  can  be  better  perceived  in  the  thermodynamic  diagram  of  the 
process shown in Figure 5.2c. The idea of using an inert gas like argon in epitaxial 
graphenization  of  SiC  to  tackle  the  problem  of  high  Si  sublimation  under 
vacuum  is  almost  similar  to  that  of  what  Langmuir  [238]    and  Fonda  [239] 
considered about the thermodynamics concerning increasing the lifespan of the 
tungsten filament by replacing the vacuum by argon gas instead. [240] Similarly, 
it  can  be  assumed  that  the  evaporation  from  the  SiC  substrate  in  a  gas  at 
atmospheric pressure is a diffusion phenomenon within a certain limited range 
of evaporating species (interface layer) adjoining the substrate’s surface. 

The heat transfer mechanism under different gas flows, inferred from the model 
described  in  the  literature  [241],  is  shown  in  Figure  5.2c.  The  heat  convection 
resulting  from  the  random  molecular  motion  (diffusion)  dominates  near  the 
surface  (interface  layer)  where  the  fluid  velocity  is  low.  When  the  gas  flow  is 
zero, this heat convection by diffusion extends in the boundary layer due to the 
buoyancy force, causing density change and the thermal gradient, which creates 
a thermal current. This leads to high partial pressure (or concentration) at the 
interface  layer,  increasing  the  surface's  supersaturation  rate.  Under  such 
conditions, the resulted extra pressure is compensated by a pressure sensor that 
opens the outlet to retain the P 

 1 bar.  

≈

By  increasing  the  Ar  flux,  the  heat  is  transported  mainly  due  to  bulk  fluid 
(advection) in the boundary layer (which in the interface layer is still due to the 
diffusion),  however,  the  flux  reduces  the  thickness  of  the  interface  layer.  This 
leads to an increase of sublimation rate, compared to very low or zero gas flow, 
presuming a constant Ts.  

At intensive gas flow, the thermal gradient and thermal current toward the outlet 
increases.  Moreover,  the  irregular  flux  in  the  boundary  layer  and  its  lower  T 
leads to condensation and random reflection of some of the specimens back to 
the  substrate  surface,  which  is  probably  the  reason  for  the  formation  of  the 
aggregating  specimens  as  well  as  triangular-like  structures  on  the  surface. 
Moreover,  as  a  consequence  of  the  intensive  gas  flow,  no  significant 
supersaturation on the surface occurs, which is why no buffer layer is observable 
in its LEED pattern in Figure 5.1i.  

The  formation  of  two-dimensional  nuclei  is  a  susceptible  function  of  the 
supersaturation, which is negligible below a critical supersaturation and rapidly 
increases  above  it.  [242,243]  The  supersaturation  is  far  lower  in  the  case  of 
increased  gas  flow  compared  to  low  gas  flow.  In  the  absence  of  gas  flow,  the 
displacement  means  of  mobile  molecules  in  the  interface  layer  are  almost 
uniform  and  are  led  by  a  driving  force  coming  from  terraces  surface  energies 
(step flow). This uniformity is perturbed by increasing the gas flow, causing the 

73 

CHAPTER 5. HIGH GROWTH CONTROL OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE ON SIC 

appearance of canyon-like structures at 100 sccm. This shows, however, a mass 
diffusion on the surface as a result of moderate gas flow. This distortion is mainly 
due to the irregular flow of gas, causing a local change in the thickness of the gas 
film  and,  indeed  an  incoherent  shift  in  surface  diffusion,  which  results  in  the 
formation of canyon-like structures because of higher Si sublimation.

5.3.2. Ar flow-rate in epigraphene growth 

In the following, it is demonstrated that the rate of the Ar mass flow also has a 
substantial impact on the surface morphology of epitaxial monolayer graphene. 
Two exemplary graphene samples G0 and G20 are compared, grown at 1750°C 
under  zero  and  20  sccm  Ar  gas  flow,  respectively.  The  AFM  images  for  both 
samples (Figure 5.3a and b) reveal smooth and regular terraced surfaces covered 
with monolayer graphene (see Raman spectrum in Figure 5.5e).

zero argon flow, respectively, at 1750° and 900 mbar Ar pressure. (c) Comparison of AFM 
height profiles of both samples, G0 and G20. The lower step heights and the step pairs of 
~0.25/~0.5 nm (indicated rectangle) exhibit a slower step retraction velocity for growth 
under zero Ar flow. 

Under the slightly increased Ar mass flow of 20 sccm, a homogenous step height 
of  ~0.75  nm  is  observed  (corresponding  to  3  Si-C  layers),  see  cross-section  in 
Figure 5.3a. For zero Ar flow, the step height is further reduced, and a sequential 
pattern of step pairs with heights of ~0.25 nm and ~0.5 nm is observed, which 
consequently leads to narrower terrace widths. This result confirms the model 
explained above. For the higher Ar flow, a faster decomposition of the SiC layers 
leads to a step height of ~0.75 nm corresponding to half of a 6H-SiC unit cell. 
The slower SiC decomposition rate of zero Ar flow results in gradually retracting 
SiC layers. The formation of the observed step pairs of one and two SiC layers is 
attributed  to  different  retraction  velocities  of  the  SiC  layers  related  to  the 
inequivalent surface energy of the specific SiC layer sequence of the 6H polytype. 
[133,141] 

The  retraction  process  stops  when  large-area  buffer  layer  coverage  on  the 
terraces stabilizes the SiC surface. Once the SiC surface morphology is stabilized 
by  the  buffer  layer, this  structure  is  frozen  and  remains  stable  even  when  the 
temperature is further increased for graphene growth to 1750 °C. Accordingly, 
the  SiC  morphology  is  not  significantly  altered  in  the  subsequent  graphene 
formation process, which is regarded as the formation of the second buffer layer 
and  the  detachment  and  conversion  of  the  first  buffer  layer  into  monolayer 
graphene. The high quality of such ultra-smooth graphene layers was already 
shown by Raman measurements and nearly isotropic resistivity. [36,37,39]

The experimental results of the influence of Ar flux on 4H-SiC samples are very 
similar  to  6H-SiC  samples.  Similar  experiments  on  4H-  and  6H-SiC  samples 
without PASG preparation which yielded the same results. [37] It was also found 
that  at  a  high  argon  gas  flow,  noticeable  triangular-shaped  structures  on  the 
surface  appear.  The  shape  of  such  structures  could  be  due  to  the  hexagon-
triangle at the surface of SiC forming as a result of stress and condensation of 
evaporating  species  back  on  the  substrate.  Increasing  the  gas  flow  and  also 
leaving  out  the  polymer  preparation  cause  rather  the  appearance  of  such 
triangles. [37,38] (See Appendix A4).

BFL1 (e) and BFL2 (j) demonstrate alternating phase color contras. The phase-contrast on 
the  BFL2  is  traced  back  to  the  different  materials,  i.e.,  the  buffer  layer  and  SiC  stripes. 
However, the regular phase-contrast pattern on the terraces of BFL1 is attributed to surface 
energy  difference  originating  from  the  different  underlying  SiC  layer  sequences.  This 
simple measurement reveals a fascinating interaction between the SiC terminations and 
atop carbon layers. See refs [38,78] and Chapter 7 for more detail.

5.4. Optimization of buffer layer growth  

Comparing the samples S100 and S0 illustrate that the presence of argon flow-rate 
causes a change in surface mass diffusion; therefore, it may be implemented in 
the  growth  to  overcome  buffer  layer  low  coverage.  Herein,  although  almost 
similar steps and terraces are observed on S0 and S100, the latter shows very small 
straggly uncovered SiC area with brighter phase-contrast inferred from the AFM 
phase Figure 5.1b, which for S0 looks rather like semi-ordered weakly covered 
regions  along  with  the  steps  (AFM  phase  in  Figure  5.1c).  The  lack  of  proper 
coverage of the buffer layer at step regions is a critical problem limiting obtaining 
a  large-size  QFMG  after  intercalation.  Figure  5.4a-e  exhibits  the  buffer-layer 
sample (BFL1) grown on 6H-SiC substrates by applying a very mild Ar flux (20 
sccm) for several minutes in between the two zero Ar-flux annealings at 1400°C. 
For  comparison,  a  buffer  layer  sample  (BFL2)  with  low  coverage  is  shown  in 
Figure 5.4 f-j.  

The buffer layer improvement was started with the growth condition of S0 but 
with an optimized time and annealing protocol as given in Chapter 4. The AFM 
topography of this optimized sample BFL1 in Figure 5.4a shows a very smooth 
buffer  layer  with  step  heights  below  ~0.75  nm  (Figure  5.4d)  and  a  repeating 
pattern  of  step  pairs  of  ~0.25  and  ~0.5  nm  which  indicates  a  reduced  step 
retraction compared to the samples S0 and S100. No canyon defects appear in this 
sample, and the corresponding phase image in Figure 5.4b and e also shows no 
line defects, which indicates a continuous buffer layer that spans over the terrace 
edges. The small step heights are supposed to be additionally beneficial for the 
linking process of the buffer layer on neighboring terraces. 

Although the buffer layer (BFL1) thoroughly covers the surface (see Figure 5.5a 
and  b),  an  appreciable  phase  contrast  between  both  alternating  terraces  is 
observed, which is attributed to the influence of the underlying SiC layers. This 
contrast and its origins are extensively discussed in Chapter 7. In the following, 
the  quality  of  the  buffer  layers  (BFL1  &  BFL2)  will  be  further  examined  by 
applying hydrogen intercalation and Raman investigations.

So far, the result of an optimized buffer layer sample (BFL1) and a low-quality 
buffer  layer  sample  (BFL2)  were  presented  in  section  5.4.  Here  the  goal  is  to 
achieve  a  high-quality  QFMLG  layer  by  hydrogen  intercalation  technique.  By

comparing the results of hydrogen intercalation on the BFL1 and BFL2 samples, 
the  importance  of  the  BFL  quality  in  the  uniformity  of  the  QFMLG  is  further 
demonstrated. The structural homogeneity and lateral coverage of the BFL1 and 
BFL2  samples  are  studied  by  Raman  measurements.  The  spectrum  of  BFL1 
1 (upper spectrum in Figure 
shows broad features, between 1200 and 1700 cm
5.5a)  which  are  related  to  the  vibrational  density  of  states  (vDOS)  of  the 
−
(6
3)R30°  surface  reconstruction.  [244]  The  integrated  intensity  area  of 
these broad Raman bands is regarded as a measure for lateral coverage in the 
Raman mapping of the buffer layer, and it is plotted in Figure 5.5b for an area 
scan of 20 × 20 µm2. Additionally, no Raman spectral changes were observed in 
the  vDOS  bands  during  the  Raman  mapping  indicating  a  homogenous 
distribution  of  the  buffer  layer  across  the  investigated  area.  The  nearly 
monochrome green colored area visualizes that a continuous and homogenous 
buffer  layer  has  formed.  This  becomes  obvious  when  the  Raman  map  is 
compared  to  that  of  a  BFL2  sample,  which  was  grown  under  non-optimized 
conditions, see Figure 5.5e and h. There, the spatial variation of the integrated 
buffer layer intensity displays a considerable non-homogenous coverage and the 
partial lack of the buffer layer. 

It  should  be  noticed  that  here  the  resolution  of  the  Raman  measurement  is 
~1 µm,  which  is  about  the  terrace  width  and  thus  higher  than  the  uncovered 
areas  seen  in  the  AFM  image  in  Figure  5.4f-j.  Therefore,  the  mapping  is  an 
average and superposition of the backscattered Raman spectra from all scanning, 
including both covered and uncovered areas. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneity 
can be inferred from the mapping in  Figure 5.5f and g but less evident in the 
FWHM mapping of the 2D peak in Figure 5.5h. The upper spectrum in Figure 
5.5e  shows  no  graphene-typical  2D  peak  (at  ~2700  cm
1),  which  indicates  the 
absence of EG domains on top of the buffer layer but shows a large D peak in the 
−
bottom  spectra  after  H-intercalation  indicating  a  significant  defect  density. 
Raman  mappings  have  been  evaluated  regarding  the  characteristic  peak 
parameters such as peak position and peak width using a non-linear curve fitting 
algorithm. 

Furthermore, the mean values of these  quantities and the standard deviations 
were calculated from these data. The appearance of the 2D peak in the Raman 
spectra  of  the  QFMLG1  sample  (lower  spectrum  in  Figure  5.5a)  proves  that 
quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene has been produced, in agreement with 
LEED shown in Figure 5.6e. The relaxation of the graphene layer is indicated by 
the redshift of the 2D peak position at 2669 ± 2.7 cm
1 compared to the 2D peak 
position  at  ~2731  ±  1.5  cm

Measurements  at  different  positions  and  on  other  optimized  buffer  layer 
samples suggest a similar low defect density over the whole sample surface. The 
origin of the defects is correlated with the SiC crystal imperfections that induce 
defects  in  the  buffer  layer  during  growth  and  the  intercalation  deficiency  like 
partial intercalation or etching which could have reasonably been enhanced by 
a low concentration of the applied hydrogen. [247–249]  

In Figure 5.5a and e, the Raman spectra were subtracted from a reference Raman 
spectrum of pure SiC to remove the spectral overtones related to SiC. A spectral 
artifact  (wiggles)  appears  (in  blue  and  red  spectra)  at  ~1500  cm
1  and  ~1700 
cm
1,  which  is  due  to  a  slight  mismatch  between  the  Raman  spectrum  of  the 
−
samples and the reference spectrum of SiC. The Raman mapping of the FWHM 
−
of the 2D peak in Figure 5.5d shows predominantly blue marked regions that are 
related  to  2D  peak  widths  of  ~27 cm 
1,  which  give  evidence  of  a  very  high 
homogeneity QFMLG1. Bilayer formation, in this case, is excluded since it would 
−
result  in  much  larger  FWHM  values  > 45 cm
1.  [245]  The  small  green-colored 
areas show increased  FWHM  values  slightly above  30 cm
1 which  could arise 
−
from low strain variations at the nanoscale, leading to a superposition of slightly 
−
different 2D peak positions within the Raman laser spot and thus exhibiting an 
artificial broadening of the 2D peak width in the acquired Raman spectrum and 
mapping.  

5.5.2. Uniformity investigation at the atomic scale 

The QFMLG was produced by hydrogen intercalation of the optimized buffer 
layer (BFL1), and the STM and LEED scrutiny of the surface are shown in Figure 
5.6c-e.  The  large  area  detachment  of  the  buffer  layer  is  proven  by  the  typical 
LEED pattern in Figure 5.6e of quasi-freestanding graphene (QFMLG1), giving 
further support to the Raman measurements in Figure 5.5a-d. [18]

The (6
3)R30° buffer layer pattern has disappeared since the correlation 
of  the  buffer  layer  superstructure  to  the  underlying  SiC  surface  lattice  is  lost. 
Additionally,  the  atomic  structure  was  investigated  using  an  Omicron  low-
temperature STM at 77 K with a tungsten tip. The  detailed  topography of the 
QFMLG1 sheet near ~0.25 nm high, ~0.5 nm, and ~0.75 nm high step edges are 
displayed by high-resolution STM images in Figure 5.6a-d. The graphene lattice 
is seen on both the upper and lower terraces. The observation of the hexagonal 
crystal structure (lattice constants of 2.46  Å) proves that the SiC in this area is 
completely covered with graphene, and line defects are absent.  

Furthermore,  dislocations  and  domain  boundaries  are  not  observed.  The 
4 × 4 nm2 STM images taken across the step edges reveal a coherent graphene 
layer that spans smoothly over the step edge from one terrace to the next.

A  larger  two-dimensional  image  in  Figure  5.6a  shows  the  unchanged  lattice 
orientation  over  the  step.  This  finding  is  similar  to  the  case  of  monolayer 
graphene covered steps. [248,249] This is also very similar to the case of QFMLG 
on the higher step of ~0.75 nm, which randomly was observed on the surface of 
this sample, see Figure 5.6d. However, in this QFMLG, the warp up (down) of 
the graphene sheet at the upper (lower) terrace, as observed for EG [248,249], is 
not observed.

5.5.3. Impact of impurities in intercalation agent 

Aside from the above-discussed successful intercalation of buffer layers by 5% 
hydrogen (95% argon), it was striking to observe much the same effect for the 
BFL samples that were annealed (600- 1000 °C) in 5N nitrogen (99.999% purity) 
environment. After this process, the samples were not semi-insulator anymore 
but instead turned into semi-metallic freestanding graphene monolayers. Due to 
the almost inert-like nature of molecular nitrogen with its triple covalent bonds, 
a direct influence of nitrogen in intercalation is unlikely since its dissociation is 
a strongly endothermic process. However, it cannot be considered as impossible 
because the dissociation of nitrogen may occur at lower energies under certain 
circumstances, e.g., in the vicinity of a metal (e.g., ruthenium, lithium, or iron) 
[250–255] due to a catalytic effect, or the gas concentration (e.g., diluted in argon) 
[256],  or  presence  of  magnetic  field  [257].  Moreover,  graphene  growth  under 
nitrogen  ambient  was  shown  to  result  in  low  nitrogen-doped  graphene.  [258] 
Also, theoretical studies expect obtainable charge neutrality on epigraphene via 
nitrogen intercalation. [259]  

Since the abovementioned cases could plausibly happen in our graphene reactor, 
herein,  a  systematic  study  was  conducted  to  figure  out  the  origin  of  the 
intercalation. All sources of impurities, e.g., leakage in oven and gas impurities, 
were  checked.  Finally,  it  turned  out  that  this  does  not  occur  using  nitrogen 
ambient with 6N purity. From this examination, two interrelated conclusions are 
inferred: (i) the leakage in the graphene oven can be excluded, and (ii) the origin 
of the intercalation must be explored instead in the gas impurity itself. From the 
gas  manufacturer,  it  is  known  that  for  standard  5N  nitrogen,  an  impurity 
inclusion  below  5  ppm  (H2O ≤ 3,  O2 ≤ 3)  is  expected,  which  for  6N  nitrogen  is 
smaller than 1 ppm (H2O ≤ 0.5, O2 ≤ 0.5). This is the reason for the intercalation 
and is further supported by XPS measurements, which showed the appearance 
of an ultrathin silicon oxide layer located between the SiC substrate and quasi-
freestanding  graphene,  by  considering  the  silicon  bonding  states  in  the  Si  2p 
core-level  spectrum,  see  the  XPS  results  in  ref.  [118].  Moreover,  no  oxygen 
species  bound  to  carbon  atoms  were  derived  from  the  XPS  data  that  would 
reveal  a  defective  graphene  layer,  and  thus  graphene  oxidation.  These  results 
show that such a low concentration of oxygen impurities in nitrogen could be 
adequate  to  turn  the  BFL  into  freestanding  graphene  layers.  This  is  further 
shown with step-by-step Raman measurement on two samples named QFMLG3 
and QFMLG4, which were intercalated on very similar buffer layer samples (like 
optimized  BFL1  sample)  with  hydrogen  and  nitrogen  (5N),  respectively.  The 
results  are  illustrated  in  Figure  5.7.  For  all  the  process  steps,  except  the 
intercalation agent, all other parameters (e.g., t, T, and P) were kept the same.

Figure 5.7. Comparative temperature-dependence intercalation of BFL in N2 
(99.999%) and 5% H2 (95% Ar) ambient by Raman spectroscopy. 
Two similar quality BFL samples (like BFL1 in Figure 5.4a-e and Figure 5.5a-b) were used, 
which after intercalation using nitrogen (5N)  and hydrogen are named QFMLG3 (left-side) 
and QFMLG4 (right-side), respectively. Both samples show similar behavior by increasing 
temperature despite the different served intercalant agents. Up to 400 °C, yet none of the 
two samples show intercalation.  
For temperature above 400°C, the D peak starts to increase which is accompanied by the 
appearance  of  the  2D  peak,  initiating  the  transition  into  graphene.  By  increasing  the 
temperature  on  both  samples,  the  2D  peak  increases,  and  D  peak  declines  further, 
demonstrating more effective intercalation and reduction of defect density. However, the 
D peaks do not vanishes implying yet existence of crystal defects in both samples. 

Figure  5.7 demonstrates the Raman spectrum of the buffer layers (black color 
spectrum on the bottom of both experiments) and their transition into QFMLG. 
For  both  intercalations,  the  Raman  characteristic  of  the  buffer  layer  does  not 
change at low-temperature annealing. Raising the annealing temperature to 400 
°C changes noticeably the Raman spectrum, which is predominantly indicated 
by  a  spectral  softening  of  almost  all  phonon  bands  of  the  buffer  layer,  thus 
implying  slight  structural  changes  of  the  buffer  layer  lattice,  which  could 
probably be attributed to the gradual disappearance of the phonon-dispersion 
behavior of the buffer layer resulting from the steady conversion into QFMLG. 
Moreover, the rise of the D and G peaks in the Raman spectrum of the buffer 
layer at 400 °C, indicating the start of the lattice transformation from the buffer 
layer into QFMLG. The further increase to an annealing temperature of 500 °C 
results in an increased D peak intensity and the simultaneous appearance of the 

83

2D  peak,  emphasizing  the  spectral  superposition  of  QFMLG  and  buffer  layer 
phonon modes in the Raman spectrum.  

Upon further annealing at higher temperatures, the D peak decreases, and  the 
2D peak increases, revealing a complete transformation of the BFL to QFMLG on 
both  sets  of  samples.  The  similarity  of  the  transition  on  both  experiments  is 
fascinating  and  might  indicate  the  decisive  role  of  temperature  than  the 
intercalant.  This  seems  reasonable  since  the  intercalation  is  known  to  be 
obtainable through vast material choices. [38,43,101,226,228,260]  

Additionally,  the  electronic  transport  on  the  intercalated  large-sized  sample 
(5 × 5 cm2) using the Van der Pauw method at room temperature underlines the 
high quality of the samples. The VdP measurement on QFMLG3 (treated in 5N 
nitrogen) revealed a hole doping with p ≈ 2.9 × 1013 cm

It  is  worth  to  be  mentioned  that,  contrary  to  the  above  experiment  on  buffer 
layers, the intercalation of epitaxial monolayer for the fabrication of QFBLG in 
the  5N  nitrogen  ambient  was  not  successful  as  in  hydrogen/argon  (5%,  95%) 
atmosphere. This gives additional evidence that the intercalant concentration is 
a  crucial  parameter  and  should  be  high  enough  for  proceeding  efficient 
intercalation. 

5.6. Optimization of quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene 

The  intercalation  can  also  be  carried  out  on  epitaxial  monolayer  graphene  to 
convert  it  into  two  freestanding  graphene  layers  on  top  of  each  other.  This 
happens with the same mechanism as before through the separation of the BFL, 
and thereby a QFBLG is obtained. Here the QFBLG sample was fabricated via 
hydrogen intercalation of an optimized monolayer graphene sample (like G0, see 
Table 5.1). Figure 5.8 illustrates the Raman investigation of the QFBLG sample.

After  H-intercalation  (lower  spectrum  in  Figure  5.8a),  the  broad  buffer  layer 
related  Raman  band  around  the  D  peak  disappears  since  the  detached  buffer 
layer is transformed into the second free-standing graphene layer. Therefore, the 
2D peak becomes broader (FWHM around 59 cm
1), and the line shape becomes 
asymmetric  (see  also  ref.  [38]),  which  indicates  the  formation  of  bilayer 
−
graphene. The FWHM map of the 2D peak in Figure 5.8d reveals the uniform 
distribution of bilayer graphene.

bottom SiC terraces (see Chapter 7 for more detail).

The slightly increased FWHM values (yellow areas) could again be caused by 
local strain variations. The quality and homogeneity of the QFBLG are further 
underlined by the low values and even distribution of ID/IG < 0.1 (peak maxima) 
ratios,  which  indicate  a  low  defect  density  of  about  ndef. < 2.0 ×  1010  cm
2,  see 
Figure 5.8c. The QFBLG samples in this study show compellingly high mobilities 
−
up  to  3500  cm2/Vs  at  room  temperature.  A  detailed  comparison  of  transport 
properties and scattering mechanisms of different discussed samples is reported 
in Chapter 6.  

Here,  in  connection  with  the  discussion  in  section  5.5.3,  in  the  following,  the 
critical concern about the applied hydrogen (5%) diluted in argon (95%) for the 
intercalation is concisely discussed. Although the main idea of intercalation of 
BFL/SiC  or MLG/SiC  is  taking  advantage  of the  nearly  freestanding  nature  of 
graphene  with  reduced  impact  of  SiC  substrate  (e.g.,  for  de  higher  carrier 
mobility) [117], however, the technique itself may cause structural defects in the 
graphene  as  well.  Some  of  these  defects  are  already  reported  in  the  literature 
[247,249,261].  Here,  the  low  concentration  of  the  used  hydrogen  (5%  in  Ar 
ambient)  is  technically  counterproductive  in  the  intercalation  procedure.  The 
used  gas  concentration,  which  hitherto  must  be  followed  based  on  safety 
regulations  at  the  PTB,  propel  inefficient  intercalation.  Thereby,  partial 
intercalation is highly plausible, as is demonstrated in Figure 5.9.  

The STM measurements in Figure 5.9a and b clearly show such local intercalated 
QFBLG areas on a sample which experiences inefficient hydrogen intercalation. 
Figure 5.9c and d show the atomic resolution of QFBLG and MLG, which in the 
latter, the corrugation of the buffer layer below the graphene is discernable. The 
height  profile  in  Figure  5.9e  confirms  a  displacement  of  layers  after  the 
intercalation process. A distance of ~1.6 Å was measured between the QFBLG 
and MLG layers, which is in good agreement with other studies. [262–265] The 
QFBLG  and  MLG  areas  were  distinguished  from  the  scanning  tunneling 
spectroscopy  (STS)  measurements  (not  shown),  indicating  similar  typical  STS 
features  as  in  other  studies.  [249,266–271]  As  was  shown  in  Figure  5.8,  an 
alternative  for  improving  the  intercalation  could  be  extending  the  processing 
time,  however  it  may  also  generate  additional  defects.  Aside  from  that, 
interestingly, gentle intercalation was reported to be applicable for improving 
the carrier mobility in MLG epigraphene for QHE measurements. This, which 
happens through the saturation of Si dangling bonds on the SiC surface  [272], 
will be further discussed in Chapter 8 regarding the graphene functionalization 
and magneto-transport.

5.7. Epitaxial growth of bilayer graphene  

Taking  the  process  one  step  further,  the  growth  of  epitaxial  bilayer  graphene 
(epi-BLG)  can  be  obtained  through  an  extended  annealing  process.  This  is 
achieved by a similar epi-MLG growth process, but at higher temperatures and 
adequate  growth  time,  i.e.,  1800  °C  to  1900  °C,  for  5  to  60  min,  respectively. 
Several groups have already reported bilayer graphene growth using different 
techniques. [13,91,273,274] However, since the graphene synthesis on SiC (0001) 
is known to be self-limiting, the growth of a homogeneous large-area bilayer (or 
multilayer) is challenging. A decrease in growth rate due to the increase in the 
graphene layer thickness entails the self-limitation of the process. The reason is 
believed to be a result of restricted Si sublimation after the formation of the first 
epigraphene  and  buffer  layers,  which  confines  the  space  on  top  of  the  SiC 
substrate for further Si loss, and thus further graphenization. [87,154,275] This is 
reasonable, since  even after the formation of the first BFL (at  ⁓1400 °C,  ⁓1 bar 
argon), higher energy (e.g., by increasing temperature to ⁓1800 °C) is required to 
convert it to the graphene layer by the formation of a second BFL under the first 
one.  Proceeding  the  growth  for  extra  graphene  layers,  i.e.,  BLG,  or  few-layer 
graphene  (FLG),  would  be  accompanied  by  further  Si  depletion,  which  must 
ensue through defects in the top carbon layers and thus can lead to additional 
defects as well.  

Following the high-quality epi-MLG and BFL growth using our PASG and the 
so far discussed optimization techniques, it is interesting to see this method  to 
fabricate epi-BLG. The epi-BLG synthesis  was carried out  using multiple  time 
and  temperature  windows,  as  briefly  shown  in  Table  5.1.  Figure  5.10  shows 
AFM inspections of the epi-BLG sample in this study. The morphology and step-
height profile of the sample shows still almost homogenous terraces, however, 
with larger step-heights compared to those for epi-MLG samples in Figure 5.3. 
No sequential pattern of step-terraces was formed as was shown for epi-MLG in 
Figure 5.3b and c. The higher step-heights result from further step-flow and SiC 
usage (Si sublimation) for providing enough carbon for the epi-BLG production. 
The  Raman  mapping  of  the  FWHM  (2D)  peak  in  Figure  5.10d  verifies  a  true 
formation of epi-BLG [274], including small MLG and trilayer inclusions, which 
emphasize the above-discussed challenge facing a coherent epi-BLG growth. It 
worth  mentioning  that  in  contrast  to  the  p-type  nature  of  the  QFBLG  and 
QFMLG  obtained  by  H-intercalation,  the  epi-BLG  is  electron-doped.  [38,276–
278] As for the same reason in epi-MLG, the presence of the buffer layer and the 
electric dipole that exists between the graphene and SiC interface (BFL) induces 
an electrostatic asymmetry between the layers, which results that the Dirac point 
to be located below the Fermi energy in the epi-BLG band structure. [22,279,280]

The  presented  results  demonstrate  significant  progress  in  the  growth  of  a

platform for further investigations,  e.g., intercalation, electronic and magneto-
transport, and superconductivity effect.  [43,94,278,281–283]

5.8. Conclusion 

In  summary,  this  chapter  presented  AFM,  STM,  LEED,  and  Raman 
measurements, which indicate the strong influence of the argon mass flow-rate 
on  the  formation  of  the  buffer  layer  and  the  graphene  growth.  For  a  given 
temperature and constant  Ar pressure, the Ar mass flow rate  controls the SiC 
decomposition  rate,  which  can  be  qualitatively  understood  by  thermal 
equilibrium considerations. This new finding has the potential to improve the 
graphene quality by avoiding accelerated step bunching at higher temperatures 
and  graphene  roughening  for  lower  Ar  pressures,  respectively.  By  properly 
chosen growth parameters, it is possible to prevent structural defects (canyon 
defects and step defects) and obtain a continuous, large-area buffer layer without 
graphene inclusions as well as bilayer-free graphene monolayer. 

Optimization of epitaxial monolayer growth resulted in highly homogenous and 
sizeable  layers  without  bilayer-inclusions.  The  further  characterizations  in  the 
following chapters (i.e., 6, 7, and 8) will highlight the quality of such graphene 
samples.  

The QFMLG and QFBLG produced by hydrogen intercalation exhibit excellent 
homogeneity and very small resistance anisotropy over areas in the millimeter 
range.  This  indicates  the  presence  of  coherent  quasi-freestanding  graphene 
layers over large areas. Moreover, it was shown that surprisingly, the ultra-low 
concentration of oxygen impurities in 5N-nitrogen is sufficient to intercalate a 
buffer  layer.  This  was  shown  in  a  framework  of  Raman  spectroscopy 
comparative  study  of  stepwise  temperature-dependence  intercalation  of  BFL 
samples in both hydrogen and 5N-nitrogen environments. The decisive role of 
intercalant purity was discussed, and it was shown that, e.g., the applied 5% H 
(95% Ar) gas is practically ineffective in intercalation. This study suggests that 
implementing pure hydrogen intercalation of, e.g., BFL sample can be obtained 
at  lower  temperature  and  shorter  time,  which  reduce  the  possible  process-
induced defects.  

Also,  a  uniform  synthesis  of  epitaxial  bilayer  graphene  was  presented.  These 
results demonstrate a significant improvement in achieving sizeable epi-BLG. 

This study supports the promising application potential of epi-graphene on SiC 
for quantum Hall metrology applications and QFMLG and QFBLG for superior 
transistor performances and extends the capability of epi-MLG, BFL, or epi-BLG 
to  be  implemented  as  a  platform  for  growing  other  2D  or  sub-dimensional 
materials or metamaterials.

6. Resistance anisotropy of epitaxial graphene 

Abstract 

T 

his  chapter  aims  to  study  a  so-called  extrinsic  resistance  anisotropy  in  the 
family of epitaxial graphene on SiC. It has been already known that monolayer 
epigraphene on SiC (0001) exhibits the chirality of an ideal graphene sheet. [284] 
However,  in-plane  defects  are  known  as  the  dominant  scattering  sources  by 
distorting graphene’s lattice symmetry.  [285] Herein, the prominent purpose of 
obtaining graphene on SiC with shallow step heights that ensure better electronic 
transport properties is often thwarted by step bunching of the SiC surface during 
the sublimation growth. The resistance anisotropy of epigraphene, which highly 
depends  on  the  substrate  and  graphene  uniformity,  is  known  to  be  severely 
degrading 
the  epitaxial  graphene-based  electronic  device  performances, 
particularly in metrological applications, as the primary purpose of this thesis. 
This chapter  explores  the  origin  of  the  resistance  anisotropy  in  diverse  sample 
types with different quality (e.g., SiC step heights, graphene thickness). It is shown 
that the resistance anisotropy highly rises by the change in the graphene thickness, 
i.e.,  adlayer  inclusion.  [286–290].  Finally,  for  the  first  time,  epigraphene  with 
nearly no directional dependence of the resistance is presented. The combinations 
of nm-, μm-, and mm-scale measurements convincingly show that the remaining 
minimal  anisotropy  (~3%)  is  only  correlated  with  the  substrate’s  unavoidable 
step-structures.  By  this,  the  minimum  resistance  anisotropy  in  epigraphene  is 
reached. Often discussed, other sources for extrinsic anisotropy play no role in 
the  produced  bilayer-free  monolayer  graphene,  and  it  proves  on  the  hand 
graphene’s intrinsic isotropy. Part of this chapter is published and can be found 
in refs. [37–39,291].

6.1. Introduction 

Being  a  sheet  of  carbon  just  a  single  atom  thick  makes  graphene  an  excellent 
material  with  many  novel  physical  properties  such  as  its  outstanding  carrier 
mobility. However, it is challenging to save high mobility when the graphene is 
transferred or grown on a substrate. For example, at room temperature, a µ = 15k 
cm2/Vs was measured for exfoliated graphene on SiO2 substrate [12,13,55], while 
it was reported to be ~140k cm2/Vs on boron nitride [292] and 25k cm2/Vs (at low 
temperature  200k  cm2/Vs)  for  suspended  graphene.  [233,293,294]  This  implies 
that  graphene  experiences  ranges  of  scattering  mechanisms  that  substantially 
degrade  its  transport  properties.  Therefore,  understanding  and  possibly 
manipulating  the  interaction  between  substrate  and  top  graphene  layers  is 
crucial both from a scientific perspective and for obtaining practical applications.  

Graphene  fabrication,  through SiC  sublimation  growth,  the  so-called  epitaxial 
growth  on  SiC  substrates,  has  the  potential  to  be  used  as  a  basis  for  future 
electronics applications. [8]–[11],[18]–[21] The method is capable of wafer-scale 
graphene manufacturing directly on the insulating SiC substrate, and both are 
highly  favorable  for  device  fabrication.  The  performance  of  electronic  devices 
highly  depends  on  the  graphene’s  crystal  quality  and  its  size  demanding 
coherent electronic properties over large areas. This is, however, challenging for 
epitaxial  growth.  The  morphology  of  the  substrate,  in  particular,  SiC  terrace 
steps  are  known  to  strongly  deteriorate  the  performance  of  graphene-based 
electronics,  e.g.,  by  limiting  the  geometry  of  devices,  lowering  the  cut-off 
frequency  in  high-speed  electronics  [299],  degrading  carrier  mobility  [300]  in 
FET  devices,  [287,301]  or  leading  to  anisotropies  in  the  quantum  Hall  effect 
(QHE). [272,289]  

Rotational  square  probe  measurements  have  quantified  a  conductance 
anisotropy of about 70% for epitaxial graphene layers grown on the Si-face of 
6H-SiC. [286] Other four-terminal electronic transport measurements showed a 
pronounced  resistance  anisotropy  of  approximately  60%  and  even  more  than 
100% for epitaxial graphene produced by sublimation growth (SG) methods and 
chemical  vapor  deposition  (CVD),  respectively.  [233,301]  In  all  cases,  higher 
resistance values were observed for transport perpendicular to the SiC surface 
terraces,  which  indicates  a  correlation  with  the  terrace  step  edges  of  the  SiC 
substrate.  

The impact of individual step edges of the substrate on the electrical resistance 
of  the  epitaxial  graphene  layer  was  investigated  by  various  local  scanning 
tunneling  potentiometry  (STP)  studies,  which  revealed  an  additional  step-
induced  resistance  contribution  for  charge  carrier  transport  in  monolayer 

92 

CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

graphene  across  the  step  edges.  [302–304]  Various  physical  scattering  sources 
were  discussed,  e.g.,  detachment  from  the  underlying  substrate  leading  to  a 
potential barrier induced by a doping variation. [70,304] Also, local scattering by 
charge  built  up,  graphene  defects,  as  well  as  local  strain  at  step  edges,  were 
addressed  as  potential  origins.  [286,305,306]  For  example,  a  high  density  of 
grouped steps on the substrate is entangled  in lower carrier mobility  than the 
exfoliated graphene on SiO2. [16,73,245,307] Moreover, a ten times lower electron 
mobility in step regions than terrace regions was reported for the graphene on 
the vicinal SiC substrate. [290]  

It is also commonly reported that step density [144], step height [308], and step-
bunching  [288]  increase  the  graphene’s  resistance.  Another  more  considerable 
contribution arises from the transition region between mono- and bilayer (ML-
BL)  graphene  due  to  a  quantum  mechanical  wave  function  mismatch. 
[188,302,309,310] In particular, an ML-BL transition at a SiC step edge causes a 
significant  increase  in  the  local  resistance.  Moreover,  magneto-transport 
measurements  in  bilayer-patched  monolayer  graphene  showed  that  bilayers 
could cause anomalies in the quantum Hall effect. [311] The influence of bilayer 
regions on charge magneto-transport also depends on the bilayer position and 
its carrier density, which latter determines the metallic or insulating behavior of 
the bilayer. Accordingly, magneto-transport in graphene can be interfered either 
shunted by the bilayer or constricted through the monolayer graphene regions 
in case of metallic or insulating bilayer’s characteristic, respectively.  [312] This 
suggests that bilayers substantially impact the transport properties of graphene 
devices,  and  an  impact  on  the  resistance  anisotropy  is  expected.    Since  the 
formation of bilayer graphene is often observed at step edges higher than three 
Si-C bilayers [133,234], it is highly favorable to keep SiC step heights below ~0.75 
nm to prevent bilayer formation during epitaxial graphene growth.

technique  and 

sublimation  growth 

This  study  presents  the  successful  realization  of  ultra-smooth  monolayer 
graphene  sheets  on  4H-and  6H-SiC  polytype  substrates  by  the  so-called 
several 
polymer-assisted 
optimizations. [36–39] Rotational square probe measurements of the monolayer 
graphene reveal nearly vanishing resistance anisotropies of only about 3%. This 
value  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  anisotropy  determined  from  STP 
measurements  at  individual  terrace  steps.  Hence,  it  can  be  regarded  as  the 
ultimate  lower  limit  of  resistance  anisotropy  only  given  by  step-induced 
resistance contributions. This study shows that nearly perfect resistance isotropy 
of  epitaxial  graphene  sheets  can  be  achieved  by  careful  control  of  the  growth 
conditions.  It  is  also  shown  that  the  resistance  properties  in  epigraphene  are 
modified depending on the SiC termination underneath. [291]

is  also  studied 

Moreover,  in  contrast  to  such  outstanding  quality  of  the  sample,  three  other 
epigraphene samples grown under different conditions, e.g., sample properties 
and preparation, are presented, which all together give an insight into the origin 
of  extrinsic  resistance  anisotropy  of  epigraphene.  Moreover,  the  resistance

the

intercalation  technique  (see  the  growth  condition  in  Chapter  5  and  ref.  [38]). 
These all are further supported by mm-scale VdP analysis in combination with 
μm-scale  nano-four-point  probe  (N4PP)  measurements  of  millimeter-sized 
samples.  There  is  a  good  agreement  between  the  performed  multiscale 
measurement  from  local  to  large-area  mm  ranges,  remarking  the  significant 
improvement of the epitaxial graphene growth quality.

6.2. Sample preparation 

This  study  is  conducted  on  several  samples,  including  SiC/G,  QFMLG,  and 
QFBLG,  each  with  distinctive  features  (e.g.,  morphological,  electronic 
properties) to investigate the resistance anisotropy and its origins. The standard 
sample preparation (discussed in detail in Chapters 4 and 5) is briefly explained 
in  the  following.  The  growth  of  epitaxial  graphene  was  performed  on  the  Si-
terminated face of SiC substrates (5 × 10 mm2) cut from semi-insulating 6H and 
), in the following referred 
4H polytype wafers (nominally -0.06° towards
to as sample S1 and S2, respectively. The epi-ready surface conditioning allows 
high-quality epitaxial growth without hydrogen pre-etching. [37] For S1 and S2, 
a  particular  growth  procedure  was  applied,  including  the  polymer-assisted 
sublimation  growth  (PASG)  technique  and  special  temperature  ramps,  as 
described  in  Chapters  4  and  5  as  well  as  the  ref.  [39].  The  subsequent  high-
temperature  growth  process  was  identically  carried  out  on  both  polytype 
substrates in a horizontal inductively heated furnace. [213] For graphene growth, 
no argon gas flow was applied. For more details, see refs. [37,38].  

[1100]

For comparison, five other graphene samples, including three typical monolayer 
epitaxial graphene named (S3-S5) as well as one QFMLG and one QFBLG sample 
are used in this study, listed in Table 6-1. Graphene sample S3 was grown by 
conventional  sublimation  growth  (SG)  after  pre-annealing  in  Ar  atmosphere 
(1000 mbar) on a small miscut  6H-SiC substrate. [234] S4 is a PASG graphene 
sample on a 6H-SiC substrate with a large miscut angle of ~0.37° [36].

The graphene of S5 was fabricated by sublimation growth on a hydrogen pre-
etched  6H-SiC  substrate.  [234]  The  main  parameters  (1750°C,  ~1  bar  Ar 
atmosphere, 6 min) of the graphene growth were kept the same for all samples. 
The growth process of the QFMLG and QFBLG sample is described in detail in 
Chapters 4 and 5, as well as in ref. [38]. 

6.3. Surface morphology 

The  AFM  topography images  of  the graphene  monolayers  grown  on  6H-  and 
4H-SiC  substrates,  samples  S1  and  S2,  are  shown  in  Figure  6.1a  and  d.  The 
exceptionally smooth and homogeneous surface morphology is a typical result 
and  can  be  found  on  the  entire  surface  of  the  samples.  This  is  confirmed  by 
multiple  AFM  measurements  at  different  positions  in  the  center  and  near  the 
edges of the samples, as well as by optical microscopy inspection throughout the 
surface.  The  corresponding histograms in   Figure  6.1c and f are  the results of 
AFM  inspection  of  about  200  steps  collected  from  9  different  positions  on  the 
substrates,  including  edge  regions.  For  most  of  the  terrace  steps  on  both 
polytypes, we found heights below ~0.75 nm.  

A  closer  inspection  of  the  topography  in  Figure  6.1a  reveals  a  regular  and 
alternating terraces sequence with a ~0.25 nm high step in front of a terrace with 
~0.5  nm  step-height  for  the  6H-SiC  sample.  This  situation  is  depicted  in  the 
height  profile  of  Figure  6.1b.  The  clear  majority  of  the  terrace  steps  (~90%) 
exhibit such a sequential pattern, and only occasionally (10%) steps with ~0.75 
nm height are observed, see the histogram in Figure 6.1c. Higher steps were not 
found, which confirms that the PASG technique has effectively suppressed the 
step bunching.

samples  show  a  contrast  (backscattered  electrons)  in  graphene.  Since  from  the  Raman 
mapping of FWHM(2D-peak) (inset), monolayer graphene on both S1 and S2 is identified, 
therefore the BSE contrast in SEM images cannot be due to graphene thickness variations 
(e.g., bilayer inclusions). This is attributed to the bottom SiC termination. (See Chapter 7 for 
more detail)

the PASG method results in significant suppression of step bunching on S4 (e) while on the 
contrary wide terrace and giant steps appear on S5 (h). SEM (E=15 kV) image (f) shows that 
S4  contains  noticeable  BLG,  which  are  scattered  on  the  surface,  as  are  seen  in  Raman 
mapping  of  its  FWHM  (2D-peak)  (inset).  SEM  (E = 15  kV)  image  of  S5  (i)  and  Raman 
mapping of FWHM(2D-peak) (inset) indicates BLG formation mainly at step areas where 
the substantial step bunching during the growth lead to giant steps.

CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

Interestingly,  for  the  S1  with  the  sequential  terrace-step  pattern,  the  SEM 
imaging  (Figure  6.1g)  indicates  an  alternating  contrast  associated  with  the 
backscattered  electrons  (BSE).  Any  bilayer  attribution  is  excluded  since  the 
Raman  mapping  of  the  FWHM  of  the  2D-peak  shows  pure  single-layer 
graphene.  This  is  different  on  S5,  whereon  the  stripes  in  the  SEM  image  are 
related to MLG and BLG coexistence, as seen in Figure 6.2i.  

For the graphene on the 4H-SiC polytype, also very regular terraces and steps 
are observed, Figure 6.1d and e. The step height histogram in Figure 6.1f shows 
a  different  and  somewhat  wider  height  distribution  than  the  6H  polytype. 
Although  the  majority  (50%)  of  steps  are  ~0.5  nm  high  as  before,  a  smaller 
percentage (20%) of ~0.25 nm steps and a higher proportion (25%) of ~0.75 nm 
steps are measured. Here, a small portion (3%) of ~1 nm high steps is observed. 
Nevertheless, the high percentage (70%) of low steps with heights of ~0.25 and 
~0.5  nm  is  remarkable  and  exceeds  the  results  for  conventional  sublimation 
growth on 4H-SiC. [133,313]  

The  surprising  BSE contrast in the SEM image of the 4H-SiC/G sample (S2) is 
also  observable,  but  not  in  a  sequential  manner  as  for  S1.  Again,  the  Raman 
spectroscopy  (Figure  6.1h)  verifies  a  pure  MLG  coverage  on  S2.  This  SEM 
contrast,  which  is  entangled  with  the  SiC  substrate  termination,  is  studied  in 
detail  in  Chapter  7.  However,  from  such  BSE  contrast  in  the  SEM  images,  a 
modification of graphene resistance is plausible, which motivates local transport 
measurements by STP and will be discussed in section 6.5. 

The  ultra-smooth  graphene  layers  found  on  both  SiC  polytypes  are  a  unique 
feature  of  the  PASG  technique.  A  second  typical  property  of  PASG  graphene 
layers is the suppression of graphene bilayer formation, which can be regarded 
as a result of the very low SiC step heights ≤ ~0.75 nm in agreement with Raman 
mappings.  [36,37] The observed formation of the  ~0.25/~0.5 nm step-pairs on 
the 6H-SiC substrate is related to the specific surface-energy sequence of the SiC 
bilayer  planes  of  the  6H  polytype.  This  is  demonstrated  in  a  step-retraction 
model in detail in Chapter 7, Appendix A5, and A6.  

For the S2, the surface arrangements are not developed like sequential terraces 
on S1, since the 4H-SiC unit cell has only two distinct terrace energies per unit 
cell. [133,141] However, it is evident that an overall reduction of the step heights 
is  achieved  by  the  PASG  technique  compared  to  SG  growth  on  4H-SiC 
substrates.  [133,313]  This  is  more  obvious  considering  three  other  samples, 
named S3, S4, and S5, grown under different conditions. The S3 is a result of the 
standard sublimation growth without the PASG method. Although under argon 
ambient with intermediate annealing, the growth was improved (compared to 
the  growth  in  a  vacuum)  regarding  the  sample’s  morphology  (Figure  6.2a,b)

[16,39,234], still bilayer patches can be noticeably found throughout the sample, 
see SEM and Raman images in Figure 6.2c. Also, from the general morphology 
comparison between the samples, it is noticed that the direction of  the miscut

angle for S4 and S5 samples (towards 
to S1-S3 samples (miscut direction

QFMLG and QFBLG samples (which were achieved through H-intercalation on 
optimized grown BFL and epi-MLG samples) can be found in Chapter 5 and ref. 
[38].  In  the  following,  the  resistance  anisotropy  of  these  samples  will  be 
analyzed. 

[1100]

6.4. Resistance anisotropy on μm-scales   

The electronic properties of the graphene samples were investigated by angle-
dependent  nano  four-point  probe  (N4PP)  measurements  in  an  Omicron  UHV 
nanoprobe system. [314] The samples were kept in UHV at room temperature 
after a thermal cleaning procedure by heating up to 300 °C. The STM tips were 
placed in a square arrangement with 100 µm spacing, and electrical current was 
flowing  between  two  adjacent  tips  while  the  voltage  drop  was  measured 
between the two opposite ones, Figure 6.3i. From the ohmic I-V-curves, which 
10  µA  to  +10  µA,  the  absolute 
were  measured  in  the  current  range  from 
resistance values R were calculated. See section 3.9 for more detail. The N4PP 
measurements were carried out for different angles between the direction of the 
current probes and the step edges. The angles of 0° and 180° (90°) correspond to 
current flow parallel (perpendicular) to the steps, and R0 denotes the averaged 
absolute resistance from the parallel (0° and 180°) measurements, see Table 6-2. 
The  measured  resistances  Rθ  for  a  given  angle  θ  are  adequately  described  by 
equation  (3-9),  which  includes  the  σ
  denoting  the  conductivities 
measured  parallel  and  perpendicular  to  the  step  direction,  respectively, 
∥
assuming  an  anisotropic  2D  sheet  with  different  conductivities  in  x-  and  y-
direction.  [209]  From  the  fitting  procedure,  finally,  the  resistivity  values 
perpendicular (perp= σ
1) to the step edges are obtained 
[208], and the anisotropy ratio is calculated as A = perp / par, see Table 6-2.

Since the current flow via the semi-insulating SiC substrate and the buffer-layer 
is negligible, the measured resistance is related to the 2D graphene sheet on top. 
For the applied rotational square method, it was shown that it is sensitive to both 
a  possible  intrinsic  anisotropy  of  the  graphene  and  additional  superimposed 
effects  (extrinsic  anisotropy),  e.g.,  step  edges.  [209]  Due  to  the  isotropic 
dispersion of the density of states near the Fermi level, an isotropic resistivity for

extrinsic effects.

Figure  6.3a  shows  the  anisotropy  related  resistance  contribution  (R
R0)  as  a 
function  of  the  rotation  angle  of  all  samples  S1  to  S5  and  two  free-standing 
samples (QFMLG and QFBLG). The calculated curves and the experimental data

of  90°,  which  corresponds  to  transport  perpendicular  to  the  step  edges.  This 
indicates that step related sources are responsible for the extrinsic anisotropy in 
these epitaxial graphene layers. The resistance anisotropy increases to AS3 = 1.17, 
AS4 = 1.79 and AS5 = 1.66, AQFMLG = 1.2, and AQFBLG = 1.42, respectively. Thus, the 
values AS1 = 1.03 and AS2 = 1.02 of the PASG samples S1 and S2 can be regarded 
as practically isotropic, which verifies the assumption of intrinsic isotropy of the 
graphene monolayer. This also demonstrates that extrinsic effects can be reduced 
to a level where they practically play no role when advanced graphene growth 
procedures are applied as the presented PASG method on low miscut 4H- and 
6H-SiC substrates. The N4PP measurements also show that the resistivity on the 
terraces is significantly reduced by the PASG method, which is demonstrated by 
the lower values of R0 and par for S1, S2, and S4 compared to the other samples. 
Hall measurements show that this is due to increased electron mobility, see refs.

CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

The rotational four-point probe measurements also highlight the homogeneity 
of the QFMLG and the QFBLG samples. The lowest resistance values for each 
sample  are  measured  for  transport  parallel  to  the  terraces,  whereas  the 
maximum  value  is  obtained  at  an  angle  of  about  90°,  which  corresponds  to  a 
current  direction  perpendicular  to  the  step  edges.  [39,286]  The  calculated 
anisotropy  values  (A  =  ρperp  /  ρpar)  are  1.2  and  1.42  for  QFMLG  and  QFBLG, 
respectively. Despite missing comparative values in the literature, these values 
are  regarded  as  a  sufficient  low  anisotropy  indicating  a  good  homogeneity. 
However,  they  are  larger  compared  to  the  optimized  ultra-smooth  epitaxial 
monolayer  graphene  with  nearly  unity  isotropy  values  (A  =  1.03).  [39]  It  is 
supposed that the observed anisotropy could stem from the intercalation related 
defects and local strain variation as, e.g., observed in the Raman spectrum of the 
QFMLG sample, see Figure 5.5 a-d. The low concentration of the intercalating 
gas  agent  (5%  hydrogen)  could  have  also  intensified  the  defects  and  result  in 
inhomogeneous or partial intercalation. [38,268,315] 

Figure 6.3b-h shows the measured resistance R as a function of the rotation angle 
for each sample in this study. For S1 and S2 epitaxial graphene samples, a very 
slight resistance increase of a few Ohm is observed at angles around 90°, which 
indicates that step related effects are noticeable also from these very flat surfaces. 
However,  they  are  of  minimal  impact  on  the  resistance  anisotropy,  which  is 
expressed by the obtained very small values of AS1 = 1.03 and AS2 = 1.02. This is 
underlined by the comparison to anisotropies of about 1.7 for epitaxial graphene 
growth in vacuum using H-etched SiC substrates. [286] Comparing these results 
on  these  different  types  in  the  epitaxial  graphene  family  allows  us  to  have  a 
better  understanding  of  the  contributors,  e.g.,  the  impact  of  the  substrate, 
preparation, and bilayer inclusions in the extrinsic resistance anisotropy. 

6.5. Resistance anisotropy on nm-scales 

6.5.1.  Local transport on steps 

The assignment of the very small resistance anisotropies of the PASG samples S1 
and  S2  to  step  related  effects  is  further  investigated  by  scanning  tunneling 
microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) measurements 
at room temperature, which gives an insight into the local sheet resistance and 
the defect resistance induced by substrate steps. [302,304,316] Figure 6.4a shows 
an  example  of  a  monolayer  graphene  sheet  crossing  a  substrate  step  with  a 
height  of  ~0.5  nm,  which  is  located  in  the  center  (x = 0 nm)  of  the  STM 
topography  image  taken  in  an  area  of  200  nm  ×  50  nm.  The  accompanied 

102 

 
CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

potential-jump  is  clearly  visible  at  the  same  position  in  the  simultaneously 
acquired potential map plotted in Figure 6.4b. Figure 6.4c shows the averaged 
potential across the flat graphene monolayer regions and the substrate step, from 
which the local electric field Esheet,x in the x-direction as well as the voltage drop 
ΔV caused by the step are deduced. 

Using the macroscopic current density, an almost linear increase in resistances 
with step heights is found: ϱ1 = 4 ± 2 Ωμm, ϱ2 = 10 ± 2 Ωμm and ϱ3 = 13 ± 2 Ωμm 
for monolayer graphene crossing a substrate step with heights of 0.25 nm, 0.5 nm 
or  0.75  nm,  respectively,  which  is  in  good  agreement  with  literature  values. 
[302,304,316]  The  step  resistance  values  are  independent  of  the  overall  crystal 
morphology of the 4H- and 6H-SiC surface.  The STP results can be compared 
with the N4PP measurements by setting the additional voltage drop at steps and 
their relative frequency ci [
on the 
 resulting in 
terraces, accordingly, 
an anisotropy of 1.03 ± 0.02 for S1 and 1.04 ± 0.02 for S2. The excellent agreement 
with  the  anisotropy  value  close  to  1.0  from  the  N4PP  measurements 
demonstrates  that  we  reached  the  ultimate  lower  limit  where  the  resistance 
contribution of the substrate steps is the sole cause for the measured anisotropy.

Two implications follow from the linear relation between the step height and the 
local  defect  resistance  at  the  step.  When  using  SiC  substrates  with  the  same 
miscut  angle,  a  similar  step  related  resistance  anisotropy  value  is  expected 
because step density and step height can commensurate with each other during 
the surface restructuring processes. A more significant anisotropy is expected for 
larger substrate miscut angles, which increase the number of steps, its height, or 
both. These conclusions are valid if only step related  resistances in monolayer 
graphene  are  considered.  Additional  extrinsic  effects  can  cause  higher 
resistances  and  larger  anisotropies.  An  important  source  for  the  resistance 
anisotropies  of  our  samples  S3-S5  is  attributed  to  graphene  bilayer  domains. 
Local  STP  measurements  have  found  that  the  electronic  transition  from 
monolayer  to  bilayer  graphene  results  in  an  elevated  resistance  value,  which 
approximately corresponds to that of monolayer graphene over a ~0.75 nm high 
SiC step. [188,302–304] Moreover, when the ML-BL transition is accompanied by 
a topographic height change, the resistance again drastically increases, e.g., by a 
factor of 4 at a 1 nm substrate step. [302]

These  bilayers  related  local  resistance  increase  can  lead  to  a  macroscopic 
resistance directional dependency, according to the shape and distribution of the 
bilayer inclusions. Since the bilayer inclusions are not symmetric but show an 
elongated shape at terraces and are very often embodied as bilayer stripes along 
the terrace  step edges, their  presence  results in a higher resistance for current

CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

flow perpendicular to  the terrace  step edges compared to current flow on the 
terraces parallel to the step edges. 

For  the  graphene  sample  S3,  a  larger  anisotropy  (AS3  =  1.17)  was  obtained 
compared  to  S1  and  S2  (AS1,  S2  ~1),  although  all  were  grown  on  low  miscut 
substrates. As discussed above, this discrepancy is not clear if only step related 
contributions are considered. The additional resistance anisotropy is attributed 
to the scattered, micrometer-sized, asymmetric bilayer spots, which are located 
mainly at the terraces edges of the sample S3, see Figure 6.1a,b in ref. [234]. This 
comparison clearly shows that the nearly vanishing resistance anisotropy of the 
PASG samples S1 and S2 is related to the absence of bilayer graphene. 

The  significantly  increased  resistance  anisotropy  of  the  samples  S4  and  S5 
compared to S1, S2, and S3 is expected because of the 6-times larger SiC miscut 
angle. Under the assumption of a linear correlation between step-height and step 
resistance, according to the abovementioned STP anisotropy equation, one can 
 1.2. The measured 
estimate for pure monolayer graphene an anisotropy of ASTP 
anisotropy values of AS4 = 1.79 and AS5 = 1.66 are much higher and are attributed 
again to bilayer graphene on the terraces. Both samples show more significant 
bilayer coverages compared to S3, and by taking into account the much higher 
step concentration in S4 and the giant step edges in S5, respectively, this should 
drastically increase perp and the anisotropy. On the other hand, transport along 
the  terraces  can  vary,  e.g.,  caused  by  local  planar  ML-BL  transitions.  This  is 
reflected by the higher par value of S5 compared to S4, which results in a smaller 
anisotropy value,  AS5 < AS4, although perp of S5 shows the highest value of all 
samples. This is probably due to the very high terrace steps in S5, which cause 
extensive graphene bilayer stripes along the upper side of the step edges.

6.5.2. Local transport on terraces 

The BSE contrast observed in the SEM images of S1 and S2 samples in  Figure 
6.1c, g, brings to the mind a possible variation of the electronic properties, i.e., 
the  resistance  of  graphene  correlated  with  underneath  the  SiC  terraces.  This 
contrast, which first might naively be regarded as typical material contrast (e.g., 
BLG, BFL, or SiC) as shown for instance, in samples S3, S4, and S5 in Figure 6.2c, 
f,  and  i,  was  verified  to  be  appearing  in  pure  MLG  samples  using  Raman

which  was  addressed  first  in  ref.  [37],  various  characterization  techniques  are 
employed.  Here  the  transport  properties  in  the  6H-SiC/G  sample  (like  S1  in 
Table 6-1)  using the STP measurement are concisely discussed.

The STP measurement was carried out on terraces with different step heights, 
i.e., one Si-C bilayer heights (1L-step), 2L, or 3L, as shown in Figure 6.5a-c. As 
already shown in Figure 6.4, for each terrace to terrace transport in Figure 6.5, a 
step-resistance is seen too, which increases almost linearly corresponding to the 
terrace-step height. However, the interesting point is regarding the variation of 
sheet resistance (Rsheet) of graphene on non-identical terraces (i.e., S2, and S3).  

The identification of SiC surface terminations beneath the graphene (and BFL) is 
discussed in detail within a framework of a step-flow model in Chapter 7 and 
ref. [78]. So far, let us admit that through the step restructuring of the SiC during 
the growth S1/S1* terminations disappear from the surface, and the remaining 
S2/S2* and S3/S3* terminations shape the surfaces below the atop carbon layers. 
These SiC surface configurations below the graphene are schematically shown 
in the inset of each measurement in  Figure  6.5a-c. For these two terraces,  two 
distinct sheet resistances were extracted from the STP measurements, which are 

106 

 
CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

referred to as ρHigh and ρLow. These resistance variations verify the expected idea 
of electronic properties variation from the BSE contrast in SEM images (Figure 
6.1g and h). [37] The mean ρHigh = 535Ω and the mean ρLow = 460Ω. The mean 
ρHigh and ρLow deviate by (14 ± 1)% from each other at room temperature. [291] 
Notably,  examining  the  local  sheet  resistance  at  low  temperatures  revealed  a 
. The resistance variation measured by STP 
significant variation of up to 
was attributed to the distance change of the graphene on the terraces, i.e., the 
larger distance results in reduced sheet resistance. [291] However, whether the 
distance of graphene on either S2 or S3 is always larger or smaller remains yet 
unanswered [291] and requires future investigation. 

270%

It is worthwhile to mention that  from the STP sheet resistance  output  [291], a 
mobility value of about ~2,000 cm2/Vs (at T = 8K) is extracted, which one may 
interpret it as a low-quality graphene sample. However, it should be noticed that 
graphene is extremely sensitive to environmental influences. [317] For the STP 
study, the samples were exposed to air (despite a UHV degassing process- 400 
°C,  30  min)  and  were  seen  stencil  lithography  process,  which  indeed  their 
invasive impacts on graphene’s transport properties cannot and should not be 
excluded. In addition to the informative STP results, the origin of this resistance 
variation and BSE contrasts in SEM images and AFM phase-contrasts [37,38] of 
the graphene layer will be further discussed in Chapter 7. 

6.6. Resistance anisotropy in mm-scales 

The microscopic anisotropy test is further investigated using macroscopic VdP 
measurements in a helium flow cryostat in a magnetic field up to  250 mT. For 
the  measurement,  the  samples  were  first  to  cut  into  square-shape  of 
5 mm × 5 mm,  and  the  graphene  on  top  of  the  sample  was  isolated  from  the 
graphene on the side and the back of the  substrate by scribing cut-grooves on 
each side close to the edge of the sample (~0.1 mm from the edge), as shown in 
the schematic of the VdP configuration in Figure 6.6. For more details about the 
VdP measurement, see section 3.10. The samples were cleaned using isopropanol 
and acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes before the VdP measurement. 
Four gold pins in the square configuration were pressed firmly onto the surface 
to contact the graphene at the corners. The ohmic characteristic and the linearity 
of the Hall ramps were tested before the measurements. The VdP measurements 
were carried out at room temperature (295 K) and 2.2 K, see Table 6-3.  

As  expected,  both  QFMLG  and  QFBLG  samples  show  the  typical  high  p-type 
carrier density of about 6.7 × 1012 and 6.3 × 1012 cm
2, respectively. [18] For the 
QFMLG,  we  obtain  mobility  of  ~1160  cm2/Vs  at  room  temperature  and  for 
−
n- type  epitaxial  graphene  (like  S1)  ~1110  cm2/Vs.  However,  at  2.2  K,  the 

107 

CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

epitaxial graphene shows considerably higher mobility of 2459 cm2/Vs, whereas 
the mobility of QFMLG remained almost constant at µ 

 1170 cm2/Vs.  

≈

This  is  due  to  different  scattering  mechanisms  in  these  two  types  of  epitaxial 
graphene  monolayers.  While  the  temperature  dependence  of  mobility  in  the 
epitaxial graphene (S1) is due to longitudinal acoustic phonons in graphene and 
SiC,  the  dominant  scattering  in  QFMLG  is  attributed  to  Coulomb  scattering 
induced by charged impurities. [229,318] Although higher values were already 
reported for micrometer-sized QFMLG confined Hall bars on the single terrace 
[108,119,229,231,319],  this  is  still  a  remarkable  result  concerning  the  low 
concentration  of  hydrogen  and  the  produced  large-size  sample.  In  contrast  to 
QFMLG,  the  measurements  on  QFBLG  (after  intercalating  a  sample  like  S1) 
revealed  noticeable  higher  mobility  values  of  ~2700  cm2/Vs  (RT)  and  ~3350 
cm2/Vs (2.2 K). This temperature dependence of the carrier mobility in QFBLG is 
referred  to  as  an  interplay  of  different  scattering  mechanisms,  temperature-
dependent Coulomb scattering, and the charge impurity density. Note that the 
higher mobility compared to QFMLG could stem from the screening of Coulomb 
scatterers in the substrate and bilayer graphene. [229,320,321] 

It is worth mentioning that investigation of QFMLG and QFBLG was carried out 
on  a  considerable  number  of  sample  sets  showing  much  higher  mobilities  of 
~1300 cm2/Vs, ~2000 cm2/Vs, and ~3300 cm2/Vs for QFMLG, epigraphene, and 
QFBLG at room temperature, respectively. However, for consistency, only the 
results  of  the  samples  with  similar  treatment  and  the  same  growth  and 
intercalation processes are presented. 

The  homogeneity  of  the  samples  can  also  be  derived  from  the  VdP  sheet 
resistances  Rpar  and  Rperp  measured  in  two  orthogonal  directions,  parallel  and 
perpendicular  to  the  step  edges.  As  before,  higher  resistance  values  were 
obtained for perpendicular transport. The  QFMLG and QFBLG samples show 
anisotropy  values  (Rperp / Rpar)  values  of  1.18  and  1.37  (at  room  temperature), 
which  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  the  microscopic  four-point  probe 
measurements. This result indicates the very good electronic homogeneity over 
mm scales of our QFMLG and QFBLG samples in excellent agreement with the 
AFM  and  Raman  data.  For QFBLG,  a  comparable  VdP  study  [233]  revealed  a 
much  stronger  anisotropy  of  about  200%,  which  was  attributed  to  high  step 
edges (~10 nm) and multilayer graphene along the step edges. The absence of 
multilayer  graphene  in  the  produced  QFMLG  and  QFBLG  and  the  low  step 
heights  can  thus  be  regarded  as  highly  beneficial  for  homogeneous  electronic 
properties. This result gives evidence of the high quality of the PASG method 
and the possibility of optimization of the growth parameters.

6.7.  Conclusion 

In summary, a comprehensive resistance anisotropy study in multiscale nm, µm, 
and  mm  geometries  were  performed.  Various  samples,  including  epitaxial 
graphene grown by different sample preparation and growth methods on 4H- 
and  6H-SiC(0001)  substrates  with  small  and  large  miscut  angles  as  well  as 
QFMLG/QFBLG  samples  by  H-intercalation  were  grown  and  investigated.  In 
agreement with STP measurements, the rotational square probe measurements 
reveal very small resistance anisotropies of ~3% for graphene layers grown by 
PASG  on  SiC  substrates  with  a  small  miscut  angle.  This  anisotropy  value  is 
traced back to the step resistances of the monolayer graphene across the SiC steps 
measured  by  STP  on  the  nano-scale.  The  main  reason  for the  vanishing  small 
resistance anisotropy was identified to be the absence of bilayer domains, while 
the specific step resistances are similar to other graphene.

CHAPTER 6. RESISTANCE ANISOTROPY OF EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

The PASG and fine growth optimization methods allow the uniform fabrication 
of ultra-smooth graphene with most of the terrace step edges being ~0.5 nm or 
lower, which prevents the formation of graphene bilayer domains. In particular, 
on the 6H-SiC substrate, a very high percentage of 90% is achieved with a typical 
pattern of alternating steps of ~0.25 nm and ~0.5 nm in height, which is related 
to  the  SiC  layer  sequence  in  this  polytype.  This  study  shows  that  graphene 
growth using the PASG method and fine-tuning of the growth parameters bears 
the potential to reduce  the terrace  step heights down to an ultimate  level of a 
single  Si-C  bilayer.  Since  SiC  substrate  steps  cannot  be  entirely  avoided,  it  is 
impossible  to  achieve  perfect  resistance  isotropy  for  epitaxial  graphene. 
However,  for  the  produced  bilayer-free  graphene  on  ultra-low  terraces 
negligible small deviations from isotropy can be obtained.  

The QFMLG and QFBLG produced by hydrogen intercalation exhibit excellent 
homogeneity and very small resistance anisotropy over areas in the millimeter 
range.  This  indicates  the  presence  of  coherent  quasi-free-standing  graphene 
layers  over  large  areas  and  remarks  on  the  significance  of  the  optimizations 
discussed in Chapter 5.  

Surprisingly,  the  SEM  inspections  showed  a  BSE  contrast  in  pure  monolayer 
graphene on SiC (non-identical) terraces, which give rise to a plausible electronic 
property  difference  on  these  terraces.  This  was  verified  by  the  STP 
measurements  revealing  a  resistance  variation  of  graphene  on  the  substrate 
terraces.  The  investigation  of  this  effect  and  possible  explanations  will  be 
discussed in further detail in Chapter 7.  

This study supports the promising application potential of epigraphene on SiC 
for  quantum  Hall  metrology  applications  as  well  as  QFMLG  and  QFBLG  for 
superior transistor performances and extends the capability of epigraphene or 
the buffer layer to be implemented as a platform for growing other 2D materials 
or  metamaterials.  This  study  also  highlights  the  importance  of  bilayer-free 
graphene growth for all kinds of epitaxial growth techniques whenever isotropic 
properties  are  demanded  for  perfect  device  performance.  It  makes  the  device 
orientation independent of step direction and improves the freedom  to design 
device layouts, thereby promoting the potential for future device applications of 
epitaxial  graphene. Finally,  the  applied  optimization  enabled  us  to  synthesize 
graphene  on  non-identical  SiC  terraces.  Thanks  to  this,  the  mesoscopic 
layers  could 
interaction  of  bottom  SiC  terminations  and  top  carbon 
systematically be investigated.

epitaxial graphene 

Abstract 

T 

he excellent quality of the fabricated graphene samples enables us to study at 
sub-nanometric  scales  the  interaction  between  substrate  and  atop  carbon 
layers. Thanks to the advanced growth control, the graphene can be fabricated on 
non-identical  SiC  terminations,  whereon  the  “proximity  effect”  significantly 
changes, in contrast to general assumptions. Accordingly, the graphene’s  work 
function depends on its exact position on the underlying SiC termination. This is 
attributed to the spontaneous polarization doping of the hexagonal SiC substrate. 
The  effect  is  elaborated  using  several  characterization  analyses.  It  is 
experimentally shown for the first time that the hexagonal SiC polarization doping 
(usually known as a bulk concomitant) is also surface dependent. This agrees with 
theoretical predictions. Thereby, a sequential doping variation is observed in top 
C-layers  on  the  pairwise  terraces-steps  of  6H-SiC.  This  finding  opens  a  new 
approach of nano-scale doping-engineering based upon the substrate properties, 
not merely in hexagonal SiC but also in other dielectric polar crystals. The main 
results are also published in ref. [78]. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
CHAPTER 7. SIC STACKING-ORDER-INDUCED DOPING VARIATION IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

7.1. Introduction 

Epitaxial  graphene  growth  provides  wafer-scale  graphene  fabrication  for 
electronic devices for a wide range of potential applications. [11,295,296,322] The 
most  commonly  used  SiC  substrates  are  the hexagonal  4H  and  6H  polytypes, 
which  exhibit  a  spontaneous  polarization  induced  by  the  hexagonal  stacking 
sequences in the SiC unit cell. (see section 2.4.4 for more detail) The spontaneous 
polarization  of  the  hexagonal  SiC  polytypes  leads  to  a  phenomenon  called 
polarization doping, i.e., a p-type doping of the order of 6-9 × 1012 cm
2 in so-
called quasi free-standing graphene on hydrogen saturated SiC(0001). [30,31] On 
−
the other hand, epitaxial graphene residing on the buffer layer shows an n-type 
conductivity  with  a  charge  carrier  density  of  the  order  of  1013  cm
2.  This  is 
attributed  to  an  overcompensation  of  the  polarization  doping  by  electron 
−
transfer from a donor-like buffer layer and interface states to the graphene layer. 
In  general,  the  graphene  properties  on  the  SiC  terraces  are  assumed  to  be 
uniform.  These  terraces,  considering  the  stacking  order  in  the  unit  cell  of 
hexagonal SiC, result in inequivalent surface “terminations.” Given that, some 
doubt is raised because theoretical investigations estimate a certain dependence 
of the doping on the stacking sequence and surface terminations of 4H- and 6H-
SiC. [142,161–164] Moreover, a  very recent nano-scale transport study reported 
a 270% variation of the sheet resistivity for epitaxial monolayer graphene on two 
different terminated 6H-SiC terraces. [291] 

The polarization doping, as a doping effect without using any impurity dopants, 
has the potential to be used for engineering localized electric field not merely in 
epigraphene  but  also  other  dielectric  materials,  e.g.,  pyroelectric  wurtzitic  III-
nitrides.  This  also  can  be  an  excellent  platform  for  other  experimental  and 
theoretical studies of defects in SiC (e.g., vacancy or divacancy) [323–331]. In this 
work, it is experimentally shown that the stacking terminations of the hexagonal 
SiC substrate have a biasing effect on the surface potential and the doping level 
of the overlying epitaxial monolayer graphene. To this end, using the so-called 
polymer-assisted  sublimation  growth  (PASG)  technique,  monolayer  graphene 
on identical and non-identical SiC terraces is fabricated. In this chapter, various 
surface-sensitive  measurement  techniques,  namely  AFM,  STM,  LEEM,  KPFM, 
and  XPEEM,  indicate  different  electronic  properties  of  graphene  on  the 
inequivalent  SiC  surface  terraces  types  in  association  with  their  cubic  and 
hexagonality nature.  These  SiC terraces can  be clearly assigned to the specific 
stacking terminations within the framework of an extended SiC step retraction 
model.  This  model  includes  a  joint  hexagonality  and  cubicity  considering  the 
position of each single atom within the SiC unit cell.

7.2. Graphene and buffer layers on identical/non-identical 
SiC terminations  

The  epitaxial  buffer  and  graphene  layers  in  this  work  were  grown  on  semi-
insulating 6H-SiC samples with a nominal miscut of about −0.06° toward 
(from II−VI Inc.). Epitaxial growth was carried  out  in a horizontal inductively 
[1100]
heated furnace. [213] The buffer layer and graphene samples were grown by the 
PASG technique in an argon atmosphere (~900 mbar) at 1400 °C and 1750 °C, 
respectively. [36,38,39] The control of the surface morphology was attained by 
taking into account the influence of Ar flux during the sublimation growth. [38] 
The details of growth and optimization can be found in Chapter 4 and refs. [36–
39].  

AFM images in Figure 7.1 (a-d) and (g-j) show the epitaxial monolayer graphene 
and  buffer  layer,  respectively,  with  two  types  of  surface  morphologies.  The 
origin of the different surface morphology will be explained in the next section. 
The AFM topography images of the graphene samples in Figure 7.1a and b show 
that  one  sample  exhibits  regular  ~0.75  nm  step  heights  while  the  other  one 
displays  a  step  pattern  consisting  of  alternating  ~0.25  nm  and  ~0.5  nm  high 
steps.  The  phase  images  of  these  samples  in  Figure  7.1c  and  d  show  a  very 
interesting  behavior.  For  the  ~0.75  nm  stepped  surfaces,  the  same  phase  is 
observed  on  all  terraces.  Only  step  edges  appear  as  narrow  regions  with 
increased phase. On the other hand, ~0.25 nm/~0.5 nm stepped surface clearly 
shows an alternating phase (Figure 7.1d), which changes from one terrace to the 
next.  As  for  the  other  sample,  step  edges  appear  as  narrow  regions  with 
increased  phase.  The  observation  of  two  different  phase  values  indicates 
different material properties of the graphene layer on neighboring SiC terraces.  

This phase contrast is not caused by a different number of graphene layers. The 
integrated  Raman spectra (areal scan over  20 × 20 µm2 ) in Figure 7.1e and f 
reveal a similar spectrum for both samples and a typical 2D-peak (at ~2724 cm
1 
and full-width-half-maximum of about 33 cm
1) which proves that both samples 
−
are uniformly covered with monolayer graphene.  [38,274] Similar contrast can 
−
also be seen in the scanning electron microscopy of the sample with sequential 
terrace-steps, see Chapter 6. 

A very similar result is deduced from the AFM investigation of the buffer layer 
samples (Figure 7.1g-j). Again, the regular ~0.75 nm stepped SiC terraces (see 
Figure 7.1i) show no phase contrast, and only for the binary ~0.25 nm/~0.5 nm 
stepped terraces an alternating AFM phase contrast is observed (see Figure 7.1j). 
The integrated Raman spectra in Figure 7.1k and l) show a broad buffer layer

related vibrational band, which indicates a homogenous buffer layer coverage. 
[244] 

The agreement of the phase contrast of graphene and the buffer layer samples 
for the same substrate step structure clearly indicates a substrate-related effect 
modifying  the  properties  of  the  overlying  layer,  whether  it  be  the  epitaxial 
graphene (which includes the buffer layer) or the buffer layer alone. An intrinsic 
effect of the graphene layer itself thus can be ruled out. In AFM experiments, the 
phase image contrast arises from local variations of the energy dissipation in the 
tip-surface interaction, which results in damping and shift of the tip’s oscillation 
frequency  giving 
the  chemical/mechanical/electrical 
heterogeneity  of  a  surface.  [332]  Thus,  the  observed  phase  contrast  on  non-
identical terraces is associated with a change of the surface properties originating 
from the different SiC stacking terminations of the corresponding terraces below. 
Therefore, in the following, the formation and nature of the SiC surface terraces 
are explored.

7.3. Step retraction model of 6H-SiC/G  

in  three 

To  further  study  the  interaction  of  individual  SiC  surfaces  and  the  graphene 
layers, as it was initially inferred from the AFM investigations, it is required to 
identify  and  map  the  substrate  terminations.  The  creation  of  the  SiC  terraces 
during graphene can be understood in the framework of the SiC step retraction 
model applied to the 6H-SiC(0001) substrate. Figure 7.2a illustrates the unit cell 
of 6H-SiC consisting of 6 Si−C bilayers called A, B, C, A, C, B (from bottom to 
top). For this investigation, it is more instructive to focus on the six resulting Si-
terminated  surface-terraces  which  differ 
inequivalent  stacking 
sequences of the underlying Si-C bilayers, i.e., S1, S2, and S3,  and another three 
stacking  sequences,  S1*,  S2*,  S3*,  which  are  equivalent  to  the  first  ones  but 
rotated  by  60°,  see  Figure  7.2b.  [140]  The  number  gives  the  number  of  SiC 
bilayers between the surface and the first hexagonal stacking arrangement. For 
simplicity, they are named S1, S2, and S3 if the rotation can be neglected. The 
eclipsed  and  staggered  orientation  of  subsequent  Si−C  tetrahedra  are  called 
hexagonal  (h)  and  cubic  (k),  respectively,  which  leads  to  discrete  h,  k,  and  k 
stacking orders of A, B, and C. In a more detailed model, one can assign to each 
atomic layer a hexagonal or cubic orientation, which is sketched in Figure 7.2a. 
[326] For the on-bonds in axial configuration ([0001] direction), this results in hh, 
kk, and kk stacking for the layers A, B, and C, respectively. The off-bonds (basal 
configuration) are described by kk (for S2) but also by mixed hk (for S3) and kh 
(for  S1)  stacking  orders.  The  hexagonality  of  each  surface  terrace  can  be 
considered as the joint cubicity-hexagonality of the corresponding on- and off-
bonds. Hereafter, this step-retraction approach is referred to as a so-called joint 
cubicity-hexagonality  (JCH)  approach.  For  the  polytype  of  interest  here  (6H-
SiC),  the  layers  are  stacked  in  cubic  (k)  (four  layers)  and  hexagonal  (h)  (two 
layers) order. The position of each atom is depicted in Figure 7.2a. According to 
the JCH approach, the S2 in both on- and off-bonds has a cubic nature (100% k), 
while S3 and S1 have ~66% k (~33% h) and ~33% k (~66% h) nature, respectively. 

As  discussed  in  section  2.4.2,  the  step-bunching  mechanism,  e.g.,  during 
graphitization or hydrogen etching of the SiC surfaces, has been interpreted in 
two  main  step-flow  models  [137,138].  Both  models  agree  that  the  hexagonal 
stacking  layers  (S1/S1*)  are  energetically  less  stable  than  the  cubic  layers. 
However,  they  seem  to  disagree  on  the  second  and  third  decomposition 
velocities  for  (S2/S2*)  and  (S3/S3*)  layers  in  6H-SiC  (see  Figure  2.7).  This 
discrepancy  is  explained  in  this  study  by  the  JCH  step-flow  model,  which  is 
based on the experimental results that include the step-height and terrace-width 
analysis. The presented step-retraction model considers the position of the atoms 
in each termination within a joint hexagonality in on- and off-bonds.

Before the growth, the terrace structures have single Si-C steps (1L) of ~0.25 nm 
high  and  can  be  regarded  as  the  initial  surface  of  the  used  low-miscut  angle 
substrates, as sketched in  Figure 7.2b and c. During  graphene growth at high 
temperatures,  a  restructuring  of  the  SiC  surface  takes  place,  which  can  be 
described by the retraction of individual Si–C bilayers with different velocity in 
a  step  retraction  model.  [133,137,138]  The  step  retraction  is  driven  by  the 
minimization of the surface energies, which depend on the surface hexagonality 
of the individual terraces. [133,162] This step retraction velocity is indicated by 
the length of the horizontal arrows in Figure 7.2b.  

The high retraction velocity of the S1 surface can be attributed to the strongest 
hexagonality (hh on-bond) of this layer in agreement with refs. [137,138]. Thus, 
the corresponding S1 surface disappears at first. S2 and S3 remain, which results 
in  periodically  stepped  surfaces  with  ~0.25  nm  (1L)  and  ~0.5  nm  (2L)  step-
heights, as observed in the AFM image in  Figure 7.1b and h. This situation is 
sketched as an intermediate state in Figure 7.2c. From this model, we can clearly 
assign the S3 terrace being above a 1L step and an S2 terrace above a 2L step. It 
is  further  assumed  that  S2  is  the  most  stable  surface  because  of  its  least 
hexagonality  (kk  on-bond  and  kk  off-bond)  and,  therefore,  the  width  of  the S3 
terrace (kk on-bond but hk off-bond) is decreasing faster than S2, which agrees 
with the model in ref. [133,137] but not ref. [138]. The width of the initially wider 
S3 terrace (see buffer layer AFM image in  Figure 7.1h and ref. [38]) decreases, 
and for advanced step retraction, the S3 terraces become narrower than S2. This 
situation is found for all graphene samples, see Figure 7.1b, Appendix A5, and 
in  refs.  [36,38,39].  (Such  a  pattern  could  not  be  primarily  formed  if  S2  would 
retract  faster  than  S3.)  This  can  be  easily  examined.  For  instance,  a  2L  step 
following an S3 termination in  the downstream direction would lead to an S1 
termination. This can be excluded since S1 has the lowest stability. Finally, only 
the most stable S2 terraces remain with step heights of ~0.75 nm (3L), as sketched 
as the final state in Figure 7.2c. This situation is observed in the AFM images in 
Figure 7.1a and g. 

The  preparation  of  a  ~0.25/~0.5  nm  stepped  surface  with  alternating  S2  and  S3 
terraces of nearly 100% efficiency is a specific advantage of the PASG method. [39] 
The  rapid  formation  of  the  buffer  layer  by  the  additional polymer-related  carbon 
supply stabilizes the SiC surface and reduces the step bunching velocity. As a result, 
the  terrace  structure  can  be  “frozen  in”  at  the  intermediate  state  with  S2  and  S3 
terraces  before  the  final  state  with  S2  surfaces  only  is  reached,  leading  to  highly 
isotropic  graphene  transport  properties  as  discussed  in  Chapter  6.  [36–39] 
During  all  the  surface  restructuring,  the  additional  carbon  from  polymer  and 
growth optimization provides a uniform growth and effectively minimize the 
step-bunching.

surfaces remain with steps of ~0.25 nm (1L) above S2 and ~0.5 nm (2L) above S3. After 
advanced step retraction S2 becomes wider than the S3 terrace since the step velocity of 
S3 is faster than S2, which is depicted here. In the final state, the most stable S2 terraces 
remain with ~0.75 nm (3ML) in height.

7.4. Identification of SiC terminations below the graphene 

In  addition  to  the  AFM  phase  images  on  the  buffer  and  graphene  layers  (in 
Figure 7.1), a systematic LEEM measurement is also performed on a monolayer 
6H-SiC/G sample similar to Figure 7.1b. In LEEM, the elastically backscattered 
low-energy  electron  beams  are  imaged,  revealing  information  about  the 
electronic  and  structural  properties  of  the  sample  (see  section  3.8).  LEEM  is  a 
powerful tool to study SiC/G, providing  both insights  into the local graphene 
coverage  and  thickness  using  reflectivity  spectra  [23,197]  as  well  as  giving 
information  about  the  local  stacking  order  through  dark  field  measurement. 
[198–200]  

Bright-field (BF) LEEM images are mainly governed by the reflectivity contrast, 
which is related to the  density of states for wave vectors perpendicular to the 
surface. A bright-field (BF) LEEM image of the ~0.25/~0.5 nm (1L/2 L) stepped 
graphene sample is displayed in Figure 7.3a. 

In the upper part of this image, a regular contrast pattern of alternating narrower 
brighter and wider darker stripes is observed. From the similarity to the AFM 
pattern Figure 7.1b (and scanning electron microscopy Figure 6.1g, and h), the 
BF-LEEM stripes are identified as the terraces S2 (wide) and S3 (narrow). From 
the correlation between terrace width and step height (narrower S3 being above 
a 1L and wider S2 being above 2L step), we can ascribe the corresponding step-
heights  to  the  boundaries  between  areas  of  different  brightness,  which  is 
visualized by the top blue profile in Figure 7.3a. The underlying regular SiC step 
structure is sketched in part (i) of Figure 7.4c (For clarity, the covalently bonded 
buffer  layer  and  the  overlying  graphene  layer  are  left  out  in  this  sketch).  The 
bright-field  image  depicts  the  reflected  intensity  of  the  0th  order  low-energy 
electron  diffraction  (LEED)  spot.  The  usual  attribution  of  the  BF  contrast  to  a 
graphene  thickness  variation  [68,199]  is  not  valid  here  since  the  sample  is 
unambiguously  covered  only  with  monolayer  graphene.  As  will  be  discussed 
further below, the different brightness in the BF-LEEM images can be related to 
a small variation of the surface potential, which is induced by the stacking of the 
SiC crystal underneath.  

It is worthwhile to mention that the SiC step edges can be discerned in the LEEM 
images (See Figure 7.3a) as dark lines on both sides of the terraces, which is due 
to interference  effects at step edge  areas.  [23] Also,  note that exclusively steps 
with  a  height  of  3L  or  ~0.75  nm  do  not  result  in  a  change  of  the  bright  field 
contrast,  likely  due  to  similar  energies.  These  findings  become  more  evident 
when we compare the bright field image with the dark field image of this sample 
area (Figure 7.3b).

(ii) and (iii) in Figure 7.3a and b.

CHAPTER 7. SIC STACKING-ORDER-INDUCED DOPING VARIATION IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

Next to the very regular S2/S3 terrace pattern in the upper part of this BF-LEEM 
image, there also irregular terrace configurations are observed in the lower part 
of Figure 7.3a. As an example, the blue line (ii) crosses a bright/bright transition 
and  the  red  line  (iii)  include  a  dark/dark  transition.  The  corresponding  step 
structure is sketched in parts (ii) and (iii) in Figure 7.4c and can be explained by 
a ~0.75 nm (3L) terrace step in both cases. Such terrace configurations occur since 
the  terraces  of  the  starting  SiC  substrate  are  not  entirely  equal  in  length  (and 
width).  On  both  sides  of  the  ~0.75  nm  steps,  the  same  terrace  type  (both  are 
either S2 or S3) is found, which results in the same LEED reflection intensity, i.e., 
no  contrast  in  the  BF-LEEM  image  is  observed.  This  interpretation  allows  a 
consistent  explanation  of  the  bright  and  dark  areas  of  the  complete  BF-LEEM 
image by the corresponding terraces types (i), (ii), and (iii), as marked in Figure 
7.4c.  

To test the surface structure model, also the dark field (DF) LEEM image was 
recorded  using  the  moiré  diffraction  spot  marked  in  Figure  7.4b.  The  moiré 
diffraction spots arise from multiple scattering at the graphene and SiC lattices 
and thus carry information about the SiC lattice orientation. The resulting DF-
LEEM image is shown in Figure 7.3b. It also exhibits a sequential binary contrast 
pattern, but interestingly, the width of both stripes is wider and not congruent 
with the stripes observed in the corresponding BF image, Figure 7.3a. For the 
regular stepped upper part of the LEEM images (see the line (i) in Figure 7.3a 
and b), we can deduce that two terraces (one bright and one dark stripe in BF) 
comprise one stripe in the DF image.  

This  situation  is  depicted  in  Figure  7.4a.  A  single  SiC  terrace  has  a  three-fold 
rather than a six-fold symmetry [333], also indicated by the selected area LEED 
images in Figure 7.4b acquired from neighboring stripes in Figure 7.3b (marked 
with violet and green spots). In the LEED pattern, three of the six satellite spots 
are prominent on one stripe while on the neighboring stripe, thus it is found that 
the  pattern  is  rotated  by  60°.  The  origin  of  the  DF  contrast  is  the  60°  rotation 
between the equivalent surface terminations Sn/Sn*, which causes a 60° rotation 
of  the  respective  threefold  diffraction  spots  patterns  (see  Figure  7.4b)  of  the 
terrace, which is sketched as green and purple areas in Figure 7.3b. Thus, when 
crossing a step from Sn to an Sn* (or vice versa) terminated terrace (S2-S3*, S2*-
S3, S2*- S2, S3*-S3) the LEED pattern is rotated by 60° and a change of the DF 
contrast appears. On the other hand, no contrast inversion occurs when crossing 
a step from S3 to S2 or from S3* to S2*, since the direction of the underlying SiC 
is preserved.  

Using  this  interpretation also the irregular regions of the LEEM  image  can be 
explained, which is sketched in Figure 7.4c for the lines (ii) and (iii). With the 

122 

CHAPTER 7. SIC STACKING-ORDER-INDUCED DOPING VARIATION IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

described  model,  the  different  contrast  patterns  of  the  dark-  and  bright-field 
LEEM  images  complement  each  other  and  result  in  a  consistent  view  of  the 
underlying  SiC  terrace  structure.  With  the  input  of  the  AFM  results  and  the 
presented step retraction model, an unambiguous assignment of the step heights 
is possible, as are labeled in Figure 7.3a-b (white color texts) in addition to the 
steps which are ≥ 0.75 nm (yellow color). All the possible terrace-step types are 
shown in Figure 7.4c and marked with colors (type(i) orange, type(ii) blue, and 
type(iii) red) as also identified in the actual LEEM measurements in Figure 7.3a 
and b. Also, the surface terminations on the 6H-SiC underneath the graphene 
can be easily followed, considering the cyan color track-lines. 

7.5. Verification of the SiC terrace type at nm-scales  

So far, the step-flow model and LEEM inspections revealed that the graphene 
lies  on  SiC  domains,  which  are  rotated  by  60°  crystal  rotation.  This  finding, 
however, raises a question about the crystal structure of the buffer layer, which 
is partially bonded to these SiC surfaces.  

A confirmation of the presented surface terrace model and a visualization of the 
SiC surface crystal of the graphene sample orientation is provided by an STM 
investigation performed at 77 K with a tungsten tip STM (For details about the 
STM measurement, see Chapter 3). Figure 7.5a shows a large-scale topography 
of the irregular stepped area (iii) of Figure 7.3a and b. From the measured step 
heights (3L, 2L, and 1L), an assignment of the underlying SiC surfaces next to 
each  terrace  step  is  possible.  This  is  shown  in  the  histogram  in  Figure  7.5b 
created  from  the  black  dashed  line  in  Figure  7.5a.  From  the  histogram  step-
heights of 1L = (2.48 ±0.13) Å, 2L = (4.92 ±0.2) Å, and 3L = (7.49 ±0.13) Å, are 
extracted. (Uncertainty values are calculated from the FWHM of the  Gaussian 
fit)  For  the  applied  STM  energies  (-0.4  nA,  1.7 V),  the  graphene  appears 
transparent, and a high-resolution image of the buffer layer structure is resolved 
with the characteristic (6
3)R30°  superlattice.  [334,335] High-resolution 
images  of  the  areas  in  the  vicinity  of  the  three  consecutive  terrace  steps  are

of the triangles above and below a terrace edge is different for the three step-
heights. (For clarity, the orientation and the rotation angle are depicted above

7.6a  and  S2  to S3*  (2L  step  of  ~0.5  nm)  in  Figure  7.6b  the  triangle orientation 
rotates by 60°. The same rotation is observed for the (6 × 6) quasi corrugation 
(diamonds  sketched  in  blue)  and  the  (6

Both terraces are otherwise equivalent. The observed rotations of the SiC surface

7.6. Work function of graphene on non-identical terraces 

So  far,  AFM  phase  images  reveal  that  the  surface  properties  of  graphene 
monolayers  are  different  depending  on  the  stacking  termination  of  the 
underlying  SiC  terrace,  which  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  observed

are used to quantify the energy difference between the terraces, and the possible 
origins are discussed.

First, ambient KPFM-AM is used to measure the surface potential (
work  function  ϕ  of  the  graphene  layer.  [172,339]  The  AFM  topography  of  a 
binary 1L/2L stepped monolayer graphene sample is shown in Figure 7.7a. The 
measured step heights allow the assignment of the terraces to the underlying SiC 
surfaces  S2  and  S3.  The  KPFM  surface  potential  maps  of  the  same  area  are

[119,172,339–341] It is known that the absolute surface potential value is reduced

graphene  on  different  terraces  can  also  be  seen  in  AM-KPFM  (in  air) 
measurement in ref. [339], which was not discussed.  

As a second method, low-energy electron reflectivity (LEEM-IV) measurements 
are used to deduce the graphene specific energy from the energy dispersion of 
the  reflected  electron  beam  in  BF  µ-LEED  geometry.  [78,343]  The  LEEM-IV 
measurements  in  Figure  7.8a  were  performed  in  the  vacuum  with  thermally 
cleaned surfaces on two neighboring terraces, S2 and S3. All  LEEM-IV spectra 
show one prominent minimum, which is the signature of monolayer graphene 
in agreement with the Raman measurements in Figure 7.1f. [23,344] The lateral 
distribution of the minimum energies in the LEEM-IV map in Figure 7.8b taken 
at the same position as the BF-LEEM images in Figure 7.3a shows an identical 
contrast pattern (compare the upper part of Figure 7.3a). This shows that next to 
the reflected intensity of BF-LEEM, also the energy of the minimum is correlated 
with the underlying SiC surface termination.

For the neighboring terraces S2 and S3, an energy difference of (ES3 
 ES2) equals 
to (60 ±10) meV is estimated from the minimum energy histogram in the inset 
of Figure 7.8b, which indicates a distinct difference in the graphene properties 
on  both  terraces.  It  worthwhile  to  mention  that  nearly  the  same  value  was 
measured  for  the  graphene  on  4H-SiC  with  non-identical  terraces  (Appendix 
A6), however this polytype does not show a sequential pattern of terraces like 
6H-SiC. [39] Although, in an early publication, the minimum energy was related 
to  the  graphene  work  function  under  the  assumption  that  the  reflectivity 
spectrum is related to discrete energy levels in the conduction band along the 
 direction of the graphene band structure, [23,345] a recent study suggests, 
that the graphene interlayer bands play the decisive role. Following this model, 
Γ
the minimum position depends on the distance between the buffer and graphene 
layer and the corresponding correlation-exchange potential. [204,343] To explain 
the  shift  of  the  LEEM-IV  minima,  at  least  one  or  both  parameters  should  be 
different  for  graphene  on  S2  and  S3  terraces.  Since  High-resolution  STM 
measurements  [291]  on  comparable  1L/2L  stepped  PASG  graphene  samples 
revealed  fluctuating  step  heights  variations  (with  smaller  as  well  as  larger  on 
both 1L and 2L steps), thus systematic step heights differences can be excluded. 
Also, the presented high-resolution STM measurements shown in Figure 7.5a-b 
support  this  idea.  This  suggests  a  considerable  difference  in  the  correlation-
exchange  potential for both terraces, which is sensitive  to the different charge 
densities.  More  detailed  model  calculations  are  necessary  to  verify  this 
assumption. [78]

Figure  7.9.  Schematic  representation  of  stacking-order-induced  doping  in 
epitaxial graphene on hexagonal SiC. 
Schematic energy diagram of epitaxial monolayer graphene on the 6H-SiC terraces S2 and 
S3 as derived from XPEEM and KPFM measurements. The variation of the work functions 
ϕ at S2 and S3 terraces indicate a shift of the Dirac cones by the same amount (Dirac energy 
ED). This results in a spatial modulation of the graphene surface potential. 

As the third approach, X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) was 
applied, which directly visualizes the work function variation on the surface (see 
section  3.8  for  more  details).  [202]  From  the  broad  secondary  electron  energy 
distribution generated by X-ray excitation (photon energy of h = 80 eV), those 
with  a  low  kinetic  energy  of  1  eV  are  selected  and  measured.  Therefore,  the 
intensity  map  visualizes  spatial  variations  of  the  work  function.  The  XPEEM 
image of a 1L/2L stepped graphene sample is displayed in Figure 7.8d, and it 
shows the mentioned contrast pattern of the alternating surface terraces: narrow 
(S3) and wider stripes (S2). The XPEEM image taken at the same position as the 
BF-LEEM  image  (Figure  7.8c)  shows  a  congruent  pattern  which  verifies  this 
assignment.  In  contrast  to  BF-LEEM  images  where  an  arbitrary  contrast  is 
obtained, the intensity in the XPEEM image is unambiguously correlated with 
the  magnitude  of  the  work  function,  namely,  the  layer  with  the  lower  work 
function generates a brighter contrast. [202]  

Thus,  the  S2  related  graphene  terraces  (light  grey  stripes)  have  a  lower  work 
function compared to S3 terraces (dark grey stripes) in agreement with the KPFM 
result. This results in a consecutive substrate-related doping engineering in top 
carbon layers that is schematically represented in Figure 7.9. This work function 
difference and the related potential difference are regarded as the reason for the 

130 

 
 
CHAPTER 7. SIC STACKING-ORDER-INDUCED DOPING VARIATION IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

contrasts  observed  in  the  AFM  phase  and  BF-LEEM  images.  The  different 
interaction of the AFM tip and the varying potential on the non-identical terraces 
results  in  damping  and  a  phase  shift  of  the  tip’s  frequency.  In  the  BF-LEEM 
experiments,  the  slightly  different  surface  potential  and  charge  state, 
respectively, varies the reflection behavior on non-identical terraces and results 
in a variation of the reflected intensity of the 0th order electron beam. 

The  KPFM  and  XPEEM  reveal  in  good  agreement  a  lower  work  function  for 
monolayer graphene on S2 compared to S3 terraces, and also, the LEEM-IV result 
support it. A reliable value for energy difference of ~10 meV was measured by 
KPFM, knowing that this value might depend on the environmental conditions. 
[342] The strong XPEEM contrast points to a higher energy difference, but beam 
damage effects prevent a more precise estimate of the energy difference. More 
detailed  studies  are  necessary  to  clarify  the  absolute  value  of  the  energy 
difference.  

Thus far, other experimental results are lacking. The local measurements of the 
sheet resistivity by high-resolution scanning-tunneling potentiometry (STP) on 
similar 1L/2L stepped samples (thermally cleaned) have indicated a difference 
of  the  average  graphene  sheet  resistance  by  ~14%  at  room  temperature  and 
~270%  at  low  temperature  (8 K)  on  both  terraces  S2  and  S3.  For  terraces 
connected  by  a  3L  step,  a  smaller  variation  of  < 3%  is  measured.  [291]  The 
analogy to the results presented here supports the idea of a strong impact of the 
SiC  terrace  termination  on  the  graphene  properties.  The  scanning-tunneling 
spectroscopy (STS) analysis suggests that the doping variation cannot result in 
such substantial resistance variation on S2 and S3, therefore, it was attributed to 
the distance variation between graphene and buffer layer and substrate. [291] A 
question  remains  open  considering  the  atomic  distance  between  STS  tip  and 
surface (~1 nm) and the in-between tunneling current as well as a probably tip-
induced  band  bending  at  the  surface  which  all  could  influence  the  STS 
measurement.  

The  presented  measurements  convincingly  show  a  correlation  of  the  SiC 
substrate  termination  with  the  electronic  properties  and  the  work  function  of 
epitaxial  monolayer  graphene.  The  graphene’s  n-type  doping  level  is  mainly 
determined  by  two  effects,  namely,  an  overcompensation  of  the  SiC  bulk 
polarization doping by donor-like buffer layer and interface states. [30,31] The 
strong  intrinsic  bulk  polarization  in  hexagonal  SiC  substrates  produces  a 
negative pseudo-charge at the SiC surface, which induces positive charges in the 
graphene to account for overall neutrality. This polarization doping effect shifts 
the  Fermi  energy  in  freestanding  monolayer  graphene  far  below  the  charge 
neutrality point to ED 

0.3 eV. [30]

CHAPTER 7. SIC STACKING-ORDER-INDUCED DOPING VARIATION IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

A  specific  terrace  related  polarization  effect  can  be  deduced  from  ab-initio 
pseudo charge calculations, which show a different valence band charge density 
for  cubic  and  hexagonal  SiC  layers  in  the  6H  polytype  and  a  different  charge 
density  depending  on  the  distance  to  the  next  underlying  hexagonal  layer. 
[163,164]  In  a  recent  publication,  the  total  polarization  doping  effect  of  SiC 
surface  and  bulk  was  investigated  by  standard  density  functional  theory 
calculations, which show a SiC surface termination dependent doping variation 
of  2  ×  1012  cm
2  for  free-standing  monolayer  graphene.  [161]  However,  the 
corresponding  shift  of  the  Dirac  point  of  ~100  meV  is  larger  than  the  KPFM 
−
value. For the exact modeling of the investigated epitaxial graphene samples, the 
impact of the intermediate buffer layer and interface states must be taken into 
account. A variation of the graphene work function induced only by a different 
distribution  of  buffer  layer  related  donor-like  states  is  excluded  by  the 
observation of AFM and BF-LEEM contrast patterns in buffer-layer free, p-type 
H-intercalated,  quasi-freestanding  monolayer  [38]  and  also  quasi-freestanding 
bilayer graphene. [to be published]  

The observation of an AFM phase contrast of the insulating buffer layer sample, 
see Figure 7.1j indicates that the SiC surface-related polarization effect also exists 
in the absence of graphene and the corresponding donor-like states, therefore it 
bears no relation to an interplay between the buffer layer and graphene.  

This  discussion  shows  that  the  assumption  of  a  SiC  stacking  termination 
dependent polarization doping can explain the presented experimental results. 
Other effects, e.g., an influence of terrace dependent stress is less probable by the 
observation of strong contrast patterns also in more relaxed free-standing mono 
and  bilayer  graphene.  [38]  [to  be  published]  A  partial  influence  of  different 
defects at both SiC terraces types can, however, not be ruled out. An example of 
a possible defect state in hexagonal SiC is the basal vacancy/divacancy, which 
can occur in a quasi-cubic or quasi-hexagonal position (shown in  Figure  7.2a) 
with an energy difference of 0.03 eV. [324] Both quasi-positions are typical for 
the  cubic  S2  (0%  hexagonality)  and  S3  (50%  hexagonality)  surfaces.  To  which 
extend such an effect plays a role requires further studies. [78]

7.7. Summary 

In conclusion, by using various measurement techniques (AFM, STM, µ-LEED, 
LEEM,  LEEM-IV,  KPFM,  XPEEM),  it  is  for  the  first  time  evidenced  a  direct 
dependence of electronic properties of epitaxial graphene on the underlying SiC 
stacking  termination.  This  was  realized  by  employing  advanced  epitaxial 
growth  techniques,  including  the  PASG  method.  A  periodic  sequence  of  two 
different SiC terraces with the distinction in cubic and hexagonal nature of the 
surfaces were prepared, which develop during the high-temperature graphene 
synthesis. The terraces in the stacking orders are unambiguously identified as S2 
and S3, as scrutinized in AFM and BF-LEEM and supported by additional DF-
LEEM  and  STM  measurements.  The  formation  of  the  observed  terraces  is 
successfully  interpreted  in  a  so-called  JCH  step-retraction  model  in  which  the 
step retraction velocity increases with the hexagonality of the SiC surface layer. 
The KPFM and XPEEM result explicitly indicate an alternating work function of 
the graphene on periodic SiC surface terraces, which confirms for the first time 
a theoretical prediction in which the graphene doping depends not only on the 
bulk polarization but also on a SiC termination dependent polarization doping 
effect. A value of about 10 meV was estimated for the work function difference 
of monolayer graphene on S2 and S3 terraces from KPFM measurements. The 
periodically  modulated  graphene  energies  self-ordered  by  the  underlying  SiC 
terraces could act as a template for further graphene functionalization schemes 
on sub-micron scale structures. Moreover, these findings are applicable to other 
polar  dielectric  substrates  and  other  sub-dimensional  systems.  Note  that  for 
graphene on 4H-SiC(0001) substrates with only two different starting surfaces, 
we  found  no  periodical  variation  of  the  surface  work  function  (see  Appendix 
A6), since step retraction results in the formation of equivalent S2 and S2* terrace 
terminations, confirming the above interpretation.

his  chapter  is  devoted  to  experimental  results  of  quantum  Hall  effect 
measurements  in  epitaxial  graphene  to  test  the  quality  of  the  samples.  Two 
techniques, namely electrostatic-gating and chemical-gating, are used to adjust 
the charge carrier density in the graphene sample close to the charge neutrality 
point.  The  stability  and  efficiency  of  the  employed  methods  are  analyzed, 
considering their suitability for the metrological applications. Furthermore, the 
challenges  and  considerations  for  device  microfabrication,  in  particular 
concerning quasi-freestanding layers, are discussed.

8.1. Introduction 

Quantum resistance metrology based only upon the fundamental constants, the 
electron’s charge and Planck’s constant, utilizes a precise redefinition of the ohm 
unit  in  two-dimensional  electron  systems  through  the  von  Klitzing’s  constant 
Rk = h/e2 = 25812.807557 (18) Ω, the resistance quantum. [59,346] This aim has so 
far been implemented using GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure devices with a high 
level of precision. [63,347,348] Graphene, with broadly spaced discrete electron 
energy levels in a magnetic field (Landau levels), enables the quantum Hall effect 
under rather relaxed conditions, i.e., at higher temperatures and lower magnetic 
field. [65,322,349] This can also be realized in epitaxial graphene on SiC with the 
advantage  of  sizeable  and  reproducible  graphene  production  directly  on  an 
insulator  substrate.  [11,19,36]  The  drawback  is,  however,  its  strong  electron 
doping [66,67] which requires a fine controllable, robust and long-lasting charge 
tuning close to the Dirac point, as otherwise, it would demand too high magnetic

flux  densities  for  available  magnets  to  reach  the  onset  of  the  plateau 
[63,350,351]  This  problem  is  represented  in  two  exemplary  samples  shown  in 
Figure 8.1, including an epigraphene and a QFMLG sample without any charge 
density modification. Thus, a gateless carrier density control of about 1011 cm
2 
 = 2)  at  low 
in  epigraphene  is  crucial  to  obtain  a  robust  resistance  plateau  (

magnetic fields (desirably < 5 T). There have been vast and ongoing efforts to 
accomplish  this  delicate  task.  Various  charge  tuning  techniques  with  distinct 
aspects, e.g., simplicity, efficiency, reversibility, toxicity, time-stability, and cost, 
have been reported.

Aqua regia (HNO3 : HCl : H2O) is a material example of this approach, but the 
toxicity, as well as fine-control tuning, are the main problems. [232,352] Another

recent  study  on  molecular  doping  using 
dimethane (F4TCNQ) molecules mixed in a liquid solution with poly (methyl-
methacry-late)  (PMMA)  indicates  air-stable  and  durable  doping  with  the 
capability of fine-tuning, however, it lacks the reversibility of the process, i.e., 
initial  doping  cannot  be  recovered.  [353–357]  Besides,  molecular  doping  via 
fluorinated fullerene (C60F48) with its high electron affinity is an effective surface 
acceptor for graphene that has the advantage of fine doping even toward p-type 
functionalization. [358]

saturate the silicon dangling bonds on the SiC substrate beneath the graphene 
and thus improving the carrier mobility. Also, electrostatic-gating [221] seems to 
be  a  reversible,  fast,  and  very  easy-to-apply  technique,  however,  the  stability 
over  time,  doping  homogeneity,  as  well  as  the  area  of  coverage  (for  sizeable 
samples)  are  the  major  cons.  Photochemical  gating  [220],  using  ZEP-520A,  is 
another alternative to tune the charge carrier concentration, but the reversibility 
of the process is limited, considering the number of activation cycles applied to 
the sample. The hydrogen annealing two methods are applied and discussed in 
this chapter.

(900 °C, 60 min, ~1mbar) and monolayer graphene (1050 °C, 120 min, ~1mbar), 
respectively. The growth methods and morphological properties of the samples 
were described in chapters 4−7. The quantum Hall effect (QHE) measurements 

[1100]

CHAPTER 8. MAGNETO-TRANSPORT IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

were  performed  on  graphene  Hall  bars  with  different  sizes  of  either 
100 × 400 μm2,  200  ×  800  μm2,  or  400  ×  1200  μm2,  fabricated  by  conventional 
electron  beam  lithography  (see  section  4.5).  The  charge  carrier  tuning  was 
achieved  employing  either  electrostatic-grating  or  chemical-gating  methods. 
These  techniques  were  explained  in  section  4.6.  For  the  electrostatic-grating 
tuned sample, a hydrogen annealing at 500 °C (60 min, 1 mbar) was previously 
applied, aiming to improve the mobility. 

8.3. Results and discussion 

In  the following, the quality of the samples and the restrains in the  resistance 
quantization  following  two  charge-tuning  methods  are  investigated  by  low-
temperature magneto-transport measurements on the lithographically patterned 
graphene Hall bars.  

8.3.1. Electrostatic-gating 

Figure 8.2 illustrates the magneto-transport on a graphene Hall bar before and 
after applying the electrostatic-gating using corona discharge. Figure 8.2a shows 
the QHE on the Hall bar that was encapsulated with 55 nm PMMA, which acts 
as a host for the later corona ionization. The sample exhibits quantization and 
 = 6.  A  carrier 
 = 2 with  a  Shubnikov-de-Haas  oscillation  at 
reaches  plateau 
concentration of about 6 × 1011 cm
2 with µ = 3500 cm2/Vs was measured on this 
ν
sample. This doping value is lower than that of typically expected for epitaxial 
−
graphene being in a range 1012–1013 cm
2. It was often noticed that for the samples 
that were kept while in nitrogen shelves, a shift of the carrier density towards 
−
hole doping happened. [218] This effect occurs due to the surface physisorption 
and can be excluded here since such adsorbates are removed by sample cleaning 
before coating with PMMA. The measured lower doping is correlated with the 
annealing in the presence of hydrogen, which does not intercalate the samples 
(safely  lower  temperature < 600  °C)  [38,118],  but  very  likely  saturate  the  Si 
dangling  bonds  on  the  substrate  below  the  graphene  and  buffer  layers.  This 
result is in good agreement with the literature. [272]  

ν

The sample was afterward taken out of the cryostat and imposed for a charge 
tuning  by  corona  discharge.  The  explanation  of  this  method  can  be  found  in 
Chapter 4. Figure 8.2b plots the change of the resistance that almost doubles after 
two  successive  corona  pulses.  The  positive  ions  on  the  PMMA  layer  gate  the 
electrons out of the graphene, thus corresponding to this carrier depletion, the 
resistance increases. From the curves, at pulse areas, it can be inferred that the 

137 

 
 
CHAPTER 8. MAGNETO-TRANSPORT IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

sample is still n-type. Please note that the resistance (Rsd) in Figure 8.2b is indeed 
the resistance measured between one-half of the connected contacts and the rest 
linked  contacts,  as  shown  in  the  circuit  configuration  in  Figure  4.6b.  The 
resistance  value  was  adjusted  based  on  experiences  on  similar  devices  and 
expected  to  decrease  the  doping  down  to  desirably  low  ranges.  Slightly  drift 
from the adjusted doping happens during the chip transfer onto the probe-stick 
and loading into the cryostat.

Figure 8.2c demonstrates the QHE measurements on the corona-tuned sample 
15 to 15 T. The sample is well quantized by reaching the 
within the range of 
 = 2) at a low magnetic field of about 2 T. The low carrier concentration 
plateau (
of 2.5 × 1010 cm
2 indicates a successful performance of the electrostatic-gating 
technique. The sample shows the mobility of about ~19000 cm2/Vs that implies 
−
the high quality of the produced graphene sample. As it is seen, the electrostatic-
gating is a fast, reversible, and easy-to-apply method, however, it bears several 
technical issues. Checking the resistance values (Rsd) after removing the sample 
from  the  cryostat  indicated  that  the  tuned  samples  keep  the  adjusted  carrier 
density while they are cooled down inside the cryostat. However, the tuning is 
not stable in ambient conditions. 

Moreover, there are two other crucial concerns: (i) the electrostatic sparks during 
tuning and (ii) the homogeneity of the doping. The case (i) is observed during 
the  tuning  in  which  corona  charges  leading  to  discharges  at  areas  like  metal 
bonds and contact pads, which can cause damages to the device. This effect was 
more  harmful  when  in  the  circuit  configuration  for  corona  tuning,  a  constant 
current  was  fed  to  the  system  instead  of  constant  voltage.  Even  taking  into 
account the considerations mentioned in (i), the case (ii) makes the electrostatic-
gating by corona-discharge inappropriate for a robust QHR. This is because the 
doping  adjustment  is  not  uniform  throughout  the  sample,  inherited  from  the 
technique  itself.  Perhaps  when  the  sample  size  is  small,  it  would  be  more 
efficient, nevertheless for the sample size in this study, inhomogeneous doping 
is inferred. Such nonuniformities were stronger when the samples were tuned 
very close to the Dirac point compared to higher doping levels. Therefore, this 
technique is deemed improper for a reliable QHR metrology.

8.3.2. Chemical-gating 

Next,  the  doping  results  from  the  chemical-gating  using  ZEP520  polymer  are 
discussed in comparison with the previous electrostatic-gating method. Figure 
8.3  demonstrates  the  magneto-transport  on  two  graphene  samples  grown  on 
4H–  and  6H–SiC  polytypes.  In  the  inset  of  Figure  8.3a,  and  b,  the  8-terminal 
graphene  Hall  bars  are  sketched,  and  the  corresponding  contact  pairs  for 
longitudinal  (red  color)  and  vertical  (blue  color)  resistances  are  marked.  The 
samples were tuned by the photochemical-gating technique [220], resulting in a 
2.2 × 1011 cm
2 for 4H–SiC/G and 5.4 × 1010 cm
2 for the 6H–SiC/G sample. The 
different  doping  levels  are  mainly  due  to  the  difference  in  the  period  of  the 
−
−
applied UV-illumination on the samples, already indicating that a fine-tuning by 
this method is challenging to control. However, the doping level in both samples 
was  successfully  reduced,  leading  to  wide  resistance  plateaus  at  ~12.9  kΩ 
(corresponding  to  RK/2),  and  simultaneously  ρXX  approaches  zero  ohms, 
indicating a good and homogenous quantization in both samples. The 4H–SiC/G 
 = 2 at ~4 T and the 6H–SiC/G sample 
samples with higher n-doping reached 
at  B > 1.5 T.  For  the  4H–SiC/G  sample,  mobility  of  ~3700  cm2/Vs  is  estimated, 
ν
and the 6H–SiC/G exhibits μ = 14k cm2/Vs. 

Again, the QHE experiments verify the high quality of the fabricated graphene 
samples  on  both  polytypes,  as  was  also  deduced  from  the  experiments  using 
electrostatic-gating by corona-discharge. 

By chemical-gating using ZEP520, the electron density in the graphene can be 
reduced by UV-illumination and also restored to its original value by subsequent 
heating  of  the  device  above  the  polymer glass  transition  temperature  of  Tg 
170 °C. [220] The doping remains constant after cooling down in the cryostat, but 
≈
at room temperature deviates from the adjusted values, as similarly observed for 
the  corona-discharge  method.  The  formation  of  cracks  in  the  polymer 
heterostructure was reported on the samples that were cooled  downed to low 
temperatures. [362] This problem, which limits the reusability of the samples, is 
not observed when a thicker PMMA spacer layer (> 100 nm) was used. 

So  far,  from  this  comparative  study,  the  high  quality  of  produced  graphene 
samples is verified. On the other hand, it is concluded that the corona-discharge 
and electrostatic-gating by ZEP520 both are not suitable for a reliable and robust 
QHR  meteorology.  An  alternative  to  this  problem  was  suggested  by  a  recent 
study using F4TCNQ incorporated in PMMA, resulting in an air-stable, tunable, 
and  reliable  doping  of  SiC/G.  [358]  However,  this  technique  was  beyond  the 
subject of this thesis.

Aside from the doping, a  challenge is still regarding the standard lithography 
process  for  patterning  graphene-based  device  fabrication.  This  can  be 
understood,  for  example,  by  comparing  the  potential  mobility  values  in 
suspended graphene on SiO2 and that of in SiC/G. [363] In addition to the strong 
doping, the interaction between  substrate  and graphene, the buffer layer, and 
different scatterings, which all are degrading the potential mobilities in SiC/G, 
also the disorder induced by the lithography process should be considered. [364] 

This  seems  to  be  even  more  deteriorating  in  the  case  of  quasi-freestanding 
graphene  layers.  Figure  8.4  demonstrates  the  device  fabrication  on  a  QFBLG 
sample  at  the  initial  step  of  the  lithography  process.  While  from  the  optical 
microscope  image  of  the  sample  in  Figure  8.4a,  a  good  graphene  quality  is 
inferred,  after  a  simple  standard  cleaning  in  isopropanol/acetone  baker  in  an 
ultrasonic bath, the graphene was severely damaged, see Figure 8.4b. This can 
be clearly seen in the AFM topography and phase images in Figure 8.4c and d, 
which show that graphene sheets were fractured into flakes of graphene on the 
surface. This may indicate a strong strain effect in this material system. It may 
initially  sound  contrary  to  the  expectations  of  rather  relaxed  Van  der  Waals 
sheets for the quasi-freestanding graphene layers.

QFBLG  sample shows a good  quality  with  well-ordered  terrace-steps, however  after  the 
cleaning process is heavily damaged. AFM topography (c) and phase (d) inspections show 
that the graphene sheet is torn out to the graphene flakes on the surface. Similar examples 
with probably the same cause can be seen in Appendix A9. 

However,  there  are  some  pieces  of  evidence  that  an  interaction  between  the 
layers  may  induce  such  a  strong  strain-like  effect.  [200]  Herein,  three  other 
related  observations  are  shown  in  Appendix  A9.  Further  investigation  is 
required  to  understand  the  origin  of  this  effect.  This  significant  disorder 
indicates  that  special  care  is  required  in  the  device  fabrications  process  using 
quasi-freestanding graphene. One approach to mitigate such degradation is the 
encapsulation of graphene by deposition of, e.g., a dielectric (like Al2O3) or metal 
(like Pd) on the fresh fabricated and cleaned graphene samples. Two examples 
142 

 
 
CHAPTER 8. MAGNETO-TRANSPORT IN EPITAXIAL GRAPHENE 

can be seen in Appendix A7. Through this encapsulation, the graphene is saved 
from  environmental  influences  as  well  as  lithography  induced  defects.  By  a 
proper etching, the graphene can then be easily patterned.  

8.4. Conclusion 

In  summary,  magneto-transport  in  epitaxial  graphene  layers  was  conducted 
using  electrostatic-gating  by  corona-discharge  and  photochemical-gating  by 
ZEP-520 for charge tuning. The QHE measurements demonstrated high-quality 
sample types demonstrating high mobility values up to 19000 cm2/Vs. Although 
the employed methods led to successful charge carrier reduction in the graphene 
samples, both suffered either from air-instability or weak controllability. It was 
observed  that  performing  the  corona-discharge  doping  method  in  nitrogen 
ambient instead of the air atmosphere results in further stability of surface ions 
by reduction of water and oxygen concentration. 

In general, monitoring the studies on the functionalization of graphene, it is seen 
that  so  far,  several  approaches  have  been  reported,  each  with  benefits  and 
drawbacks.  This  indicates  that  there  is  still  much  room  for  technological 
improvements.  Future  works  need  to  be  concentrating  on  further  effective 
techniques to acquire robust and stable charge carrier tuning in SiC/G. Moreover, 
the lithography process needs to be compatible with the specific graphene type, 
as was exemplary shown for the QFBLG sample. This suggests that the graphene 
samples  must  be  first  covered,  preferably  after  the  fabrication  to  be  protected 
from the environmental influences as well as lithography processes.

CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 

9.1. Summary 

This thesis explored the synthesis of epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide for the 
fabrication  of  high-quality  samples  required,  particularly  in  metrological 
applications.  To  meet  this  aim,  several  optimizations  were  imposed  to  gain 
reproducible  and  robust  processes.  Various  characterization  techniques  were 
employed to scrutinize the structural and electronic properties of the samples. 
These have led to a better understanding of the complex fabrication processes, 
influence  of  multiple  contributing  parameters,  considerations  in  device 
fabrications,  as  well  as  substrate  and  graphene 
interplay.  The 
experimental results of this thesis can be categorized into four detailed studies 
that the highlights are briefly summarized in the following. 

layers 

● The first experimental section included a  detailed study on the synthesis of 
five  different  sample  types,  i.e.,  epitaxial  buffer  layer,  epitaxial  monolayer 
graphene,  epitaxial  bilayer  graphene,  and  two  others  known  as  quasi-
freestanding  monolayer  and  bilayer  (QFMLG/QFBLG),  each  with  certain 
characteristics  features.    Accordingly,  high-quality  ultra-smooth  bilayer-free 
monolayer  graphene  with  unprecedented  reproducibility  was  successfully 
grown.  [36–39]  Similarly,  coherent  graphene-free  buffer  layer  sheets  were 
fabricated.  [38]  By  this,  two  practical  challenges  in  buffer  layer  growth  are 
overcome, i.e., the lack of  a buffer layer or formation of extra carbon layers at 
step  regions.  Such  high  quality  of  the  buffer  layer  is  essential  when  uniform 
quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene (QFMLG) is desired.  

Moreover,  such  a  homogenous  buffer  layer  helped  better  understand  the 
complex  growth, 
including  surface  restructuring  and  recrystallization 
mechanisms. It was shown that by properly choosing a set of growth parameters, 
it is possible to prevent structural defects (canyon defects and step defects) and 
obtain a continuous, large-area buffer layer without graphene inclusions and a 
bilayer-free  graphene  monolayer.  To  this  end,  it  is  important  to  notice  the 
decisive but less-regarded influence of the argon flow rate in the growth process. 
It was found that for a given temperature and constant Ar pressure, the Ar mass 
flow-rate strongly influences the SiC decomposition rate, which can qualitatively 
be understood by thermal equilibrium considerations. This new finding has the 
potential to improve the graphene quality by avoiding accelerated step bunching 
at  higher  temperatures  and  graphene  roughening  for  lower  Ar  pressures, 
respectively.  

Furthermore, the optimization to obtain uniform epitaxial bilayer graphene was 
presented. It is technically challenging to fabricate epitaxial bilayer graphene on 
SiC  (0001)  due  to  a  self-limiting  effect  on  the  surface.  However,  by  a  proper 

145 

CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 

treatment  and  growth  recipe,  homogenous  epitaxial  bilayer  graphene  was 
successfully grown.  

In addition, the QFMLG and QFBLG produced by hydrogen intercalation exhibit 
excellent homogeneity over areas in the millimeter range. Herein, in addition to 
the  major  intercalation  parameters  (pressure,  temperature,  time),  also  the 
intercalant  purity  is  vital  in  the  efficiency  of  the  intercalation  process,  as  was 
evidenced by two detailed investigations: using (i) 5% Hydrogen (95% Ar) and 
(ii) low-concentration oxygen impurities in nitrogen 5N (99.999%). From these, 
two  consistent  implications  were  deduced.  Firstly,  the  intercalation  occurred 
consistently in both cases, and secondly, the process is not as efficient as when 
pure  intercalant  agents  are  applied.  This  low  concentration  can  be  somewhat 
compensated by prolonging the process; however, it cannot be overextended as 
otherwise  induces  other  defects  due  to  etching  effects  that  occur  in  graphene 
layers.  

● In the second experimental part, the quality of produced types was analyzed, 
conducting  electronic  transport  measurements  from  nanometer  to  millimeter 
scale. An important challenge confronting the electronic applications of epitaxial 
graphene  is  related  to  its  extrinsic  resistance  anisotropy.  Using  an  angle-
dependent nano four-point probe (N4PP), it was demonstrated that monolayer 
epigraphene can be produced on both 4H- and 6H-SiC(0001) polytypes with a 
resistance  anisotropy  as  low  as  only  2%.  This  study  systematically  compared 
various  samples  with  different  quality  (e.g.,  step  height,  thickness  variation, 
miscut  angle)  concluded  that  the  anisotropy  value  is  traced  back  to  the  step 
resistances of the monolayer graphene across the SiC steps as also verified by 
scanning  tunneling  potentiometry (STP) transport on the nanoscale. The  main 
reason  for  the  vanishing  small  resistance  anisotropy  was  identified  to  be  the 
absence  of  bilayer  domains.  Eventually,  the  small  remaining  resistance 
anisotropy was entirely attributed to the resistance and the number of substrate 
steps  that  induce  local  scattering.  Thereby,  the  data  represented  the  ultimate 
limit for resistance isotropy of epitaxial graphene on SiC for the given miscut of 
the substrate.  Similar results were  deduced from the mm-scale Van der Pauw 
measurements  underlining  the  excellent  uniformity  of  the  samples.  Also,  the 
QFMLG  and  QFBLG  produced  by  hydrogen  intercalation  exhibit  excellent 
homogeneity and very small resistance anisotropy over areas in the millimeter 
range. This also indicates the presence of coherent quasi-free-standing graphene 
layers over large areas.  

Because SiC substrate steps cannot be entirely avoided, it is impossible to achieve 
perfect  resistance  isotropy  for  epitaxial  graphene.  However,  for  the  produced 
bilayer-free  graphene  on  ultralow  terraces,  negligible  small  deviations  from 

146 

CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 

isotropy can be obtained. This shows significant  progress in  the  fabrication  of 
uniform  epitaxial  graphene  layers.  In  general,  this  study  highlights  the 
importance  of  bilayer-free  graphene  growth  for  all  kinds  of  epitaxial  growth 
techniques  whenever  isotropic  properties  are  demanded  for  optimum  device 
performance. It makes the device orientation independent of step direction and 
improves  the  freedom  for  designing  device  layouts,  thereby  promoting  the 
potential for future device applications of epitaxial graphene. 

●  Based  on  the  third  experimental  results,  it  was  shown  that  the  presented 
advanced growth yields a precise graphene thickness control. Thereby graphene 
can  be  fabricated  on  either  identical  or  non-identical  hexagonal  SiC  terrace 
terminations. This provides an excellent platform for studying the mesoscopic 
interaction between the individual SiC terminations and the top carbon layers. 
Accordingly, a tight correlation between the termination of the SiC stacking and 
the  graphene  properties  was  observed  in  various  characterization  techniques. 
This  correlation  was  attributed  to  a  proximity  effect  of  the  SiC  termination-
dependent  polarization  doping  on  the  overlying  graphene  layer.  Therefore,  it 
was  concluded  that  the  stacking  termination  of  the  SiC  terraces  types  in 
association with their cubic and hexagonality nature has a biasing effect on the 
surface  potential  and  the  doping  level  of  the  overlying  epitaxial  monolayer 
graphene. The  unambiguous identification and assignment of the SiC terraces 
were described within the framework of an extended SiC step retraction model. 

●  Finally,  the  fourth  experimental  study  devoted  to  magneto-transport  in  the 
produced  graphene  types.  Two  techniques,  namely  electrostatic-gating  and 
chemical-gating,  were  employed  to  tune  the  graphene  samples  close  to  Dirac 
 = 2) at reasonably low magnetic fields (< 5T). 
points to reach the quantization (
This goal was accomplished through these  techniques; however, each method 
has certain drawbacks that make them not entirely suitable for a reliable, robust, 
and durable system as is demanded in quantum resistance metrology. Therefore, 
other alternatives should be sought. The measurements, however, underline the 
excellent quality of the samples. To protect the graphene layers from the possible 
defects during lithography processes and/or other environmental influences, it 
was suggested to initially encapsulate them with a depositing layer, e.g., Al2O3 
by atomic layer deposition as shown in Appendix A7.  

ν

In  short,  the  presented  PASG  and  fine  growth  optimization  methods  bear  the 
potential to reduce the terrace step heights down to an ultimate level of a single 
Si-C  bilayer.  For  the  produced  bilayer-free  graphene  on  ultralow  terraces, 
negligible  small  deviations  from  the  resistance  isotropy  can  be  obtained.  This 
study  supports  the  promising  application  potential  of  epigraphene  on  SiC  for 
quantum  Hall  metrology  applications  as  well  as  QFMLG  and  QFBLG  for 

147 

CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 

superior transistor performances and extends the capability of epigraphene or 
the buffer layer to be implemented as a platform for growing other 2D materials 
or metamaterials. 

9.2. Outlook 

From  the  growth  optimization,  it  was  concluded  that  an  early-growth-stage 
suppression  of  step-bunching  is  the  key  component  to  improve  the  quality  of 
epitaxial graphene. From the initial results, it seems yet that the step-bunching 
may  ultimately  be  frozen.  This  meets  the  objective  of  optimized  epitaxial 
graphene fabrication and motivates further investigations.  

Moreover, the quality of epitaxial bilayer graphene synthesis can be even further 
optimized and improved to gain higher thickness control to yield pure  bilayer 
graphene.  

Different defects originating from the SiC substrate or growth bear interesting 
properties. For instance,  it was shown that  triangular-shaped structures could 
form  on  the  SiC  surface  during  graphenization,  in  which  even  under  special 
conditions can thoroughly be densely-grown beside each other (see Appendix 
A4). [37,38,298] These structures provide intriguing zero-dimensional platforms 
for  further  investigations.  For  example,  recent  studies  demonstrate  a  room-
temperature  strain-induced  quantum  Hall  phase  in  graphene  due  to  giant 
pseudomagnetic fields (> 41 T) induced by triangular nanoprisms. [38,365,366] 
Moreover,  the  variation  of  SiC  miscut  angles  on  the  surface  leads  to  the 
formation of different domains wherein the polarity may change due to variation 
in  SiC  crystal  planes.  An  example  can  be  seen  in  Appendix  A8.  Also,  a 
deformation  of  epigraphene  in  ambient  or  under  different  measurement 
conditions, i.e., SEM and LEEM, was observed, see Appendix A9. Further studies 
are required to understand the origin of these defects.

Although the buffer layer’s (6
3)R30° structure was already revealed back 
in  1975  [8],  its  true  structure  is  still  not  completely  clear.  For  instance,  recent 
studies predict that rather than a single honeycomb super-lattice, other crystal 
symmetries  might  coexist.  [21,310,367,368]  Additionally,  from  the  SiC  crystal 
rotation and the following buffer layer reported in this thesis (see Chapter 7), a 
question  arises  about  the  possible  formation  of  buffer  layer  domains  with 
boundary  dislocation  on  different 
terraces.  Assuming 
honeycomb crest of the buffer layer superlattice, these domains should not form, 
but considering probable other coexisting symmetries, it is then likely to have 
boundary dislocations in the buffer layer structure. Moreover, in some studies, 

(non-identical) 

148 

 
CHAPTER 9. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 

the buffer layer (due to its covalent bonds to the SiC) is considered as being part 
of  the  SiC  bulk  too.  [369]  However,  one  may  need  to  consider  a  probable 
dissimilar bonding nature. For example, for the 6H-SiC, it was shown in Chapter 
7 that the position of Si atoms on S3 (h position) and S2 (k position) is different 
therefore the corresponding bonds to the top buffer layer maybe not identical, as 
it is also the case in the bulk of 6H-SiC. These issues require further theoretical 
and experimental investigations.  

Moreover, by the presented advanced growth, the graphene was formed on non-
identical  SiC  terminations.  On  such  periodic  surface  configurations,  the  top 
graphene layers exhibit an alternating doping variation in association with the 
underlying  SiC  surfaces.  The  effect  is  attributed  to  the  polarization  effect 
originating from the pyroelectric nature of hexagonal SiC. This finding opens a 
new approach for a nano-scale doping-engineering on dielectric polar substrates 
without  the  use  of  impurity  dopants.  This  is  expected  to  be  a  general  effect 
obtainable  in  other  polar  dielectric  materials  like  GaN.  Additionally,  such 
alternating  terrace  types  in  the  hexagonal  SiC  have  possible  nonequal  basal 
vacancy/divacancy  defect  states,  which  can  occur  in  a  quasi-cubic  or  quasi-
hexagonal position. [324] Such possible symmetric location is an added value for 
potential applications and motivates further research.  

Among the three main challenges facing in epigraphene-based electronics, i.e., 
the  size  restraints,  reproducible  thickness  control,  and  “as-grown”  intense 
carrier  concentration,  only  the  latter  is  the  biggest  remaining  hurdle  which 
requires  appropriate  alternatives.  When  considering  the  epigraphene-based 
quantum resistance metrology, a fine-tuning of charge carrier density with long-
term  stability  (ideally  constant)  with  proper  graphene-isolation  from  the 
environmental influences is essential. These requirements have not yet been fully 
accomplished by the existing methods and demand proper approaches. 

Aside from that, based on a theoretical investigation of the magneto-transport in 
stepped graphene, a new kind of Aharonov–Bohm interferometers is expected. 
[370,371]  The  epigraphene  in  this  study  was  produced  on  very  regular  steps-
terraces  with  90%  in  a  periodic  manner.  [38,39]  Therefore,  it  is  interesting  to 
investigate  the  direction  dependency  of  the  applied  magnetic  field  in  QHE 
measurements on such samples to test the abovementioned theory. 

Epitaxial graphene is also a versatile platform for the fabrication of other sub-
dimensional  materials.  It  was  shown  that  the  intrinsic  SiC  micropipes  and 
additional holes induced by the growth process (see Appendix A7 and A10) as 
"mediation sites" can utilize gallium intercalation. This leads to the fabrication of 
graphene-metallene  heterostacks  of  Van  der  Waals  combined  2D-layers  of 
bilayer  graphene  (BLG)  and  gallium  stacking  layers  on  SiC  substrate

Finally,  it  seems  that  large-area  fabrication  of  2D/sub-dimensional  materials 
systems  is  generally  still  in  their  infancy.  There  exist  a  limited  number  of 
manufacturers, and the main clients are still research labs. Industrialization and 
commercialization of these materials probably will need at least a decade from 
now. As seen from such a perspective, this would be a “golden period” for start-
up companies, which can effectively boost the advancement of technologies in 
2D materials synthesis and technologies for being adapted in the conventional 
semiconductor industry as the next-generation alternatives.

contacts to the graphene*. As mentioned in Chapter 4, the VdP setup used in this 
work causes local damages to the graphene sample, where the fixed equidistant 
gold  pins  meet  the  graphene,  see  Figure  3.13b,  and  Figure  6.6.  Therefore,  the 
samples after the first measurement and taking out, most of the time, could not 
be  reused  for  further  investigations.  To  deal  with  this  problem,  as  well  as 
avoiding  durable  lithography  processes,  which  may  even  cause  other  surface 
inhomogeneities  (e.g.,  polymer  adsorbates),  a  so-called  pen-patterning  is 
presented. Figure 9.1 illustrates the simple fabrication process of graphene Van 
der Pauw structures by handwriting the patterns to be defined using a soft pen, 
which includes four steps.  

The  process  begins  with  patterning  the  sample  for  etching  of  graphene  at  the 
contact areas. Firstly, the graphene areas not to be etched are covered by ink by 
pen  writing.  Then  the  contact  areas  (which  are  free  of  ink)  on  the  sample 
(5 × 5 mm2) are etched by an oxygen/argon gas mixture using the ink as a mask. 
As Figure 9.1(ii) shows, the etching was successful, and graphene below the ink 
remained safe, even applying the exact etching parameters that were used for 
etching the graphene after the EBL process on PMMA (see Chapter 4). Then the 
sample can be easily cleaned using acetone and isopropanol. In the third step, 
the sample is patterned for Ti/Au (20 nm/50 nm) contacts metallization. Ti sticks 
well to the etched areas (SiC) and is covered by the gold layer, which all overlap 
the  graphene  areas,  as  shown  in  Figure  9.1(iii).  Finally,  the  lift-off  process  is 
quickly performed by immersing the sample in an acetone/isopropanol beaker 
and ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes. The following VdP measurements verified 
 900  cm2/Vs  with  an

about  1  hour,  which  is  significantly  timesaving  compared  to  a  conventional 
lithography process. Here, the pen-patterning concept was performed manually 
using  a  Staedtler  Lumocolor  pen.  It  can  be  much  improved,  for  example,  by 
implementing available drawing robots in the market to obtain sharp edges for 
the patterns. Moreover, employing this technique, the graphene could be easily 
locally etched or intercalated. The demonstrated process is an initial prototype 
that has the potential for improvements and applications.  

Figure 9.1. Pen-patterning prototype. 
The pen-patterning procedure for the fabrication of graphene Van der Pauw structures has 
four successive steps. (i) The pattern is sketched on the sample and the contact areas where 
the graphene is left without ink-covered are etched away using oxygen/argon RIE plasma. 
(ii)  The  pattern  is  then  simply  washed  away  by  acetone  and  isopropanol.  The  optical 
microscope image demonstrates successful etching.  (iii) A new pattern is drawn for the 
metallization. Narrow graphene lines (depicted with green color) are not covered with ink 
to provide graphene/gold contacting overlaps. Metallization is performed by 20nm Ti and 
50 nm Au deposition. (iv) A fast lift-off process can be easily done by acetone/isopropanol 
cleaning in the ultrasonic bath. The optical microscope image demonstrates the graphene 
and contact regions after the cleaning. The patterning was carried out manually, therefore 
the  edge  areas  are  not  sharp.  However, it  can  be substantially  improved using  available 
drawing machines in the market.

A2. Magneto-transport in strong p-type epigraphene 

A  charge  carrier  drift  may  occur  in  unprotected  bare  epigraphene  since  the 
graphene is sensitive to its environment, e.g., the water and oxygen existed in air 
through  surface  physisorption  alter 
towards  hole-doping. 
[317,372,373] Here, for a ready epigraphene Hall-bar, which was annealed in a 
dry-nitrogen oven (at 90 °C for 72 hours, 1 bar) and later covered with 55 nm 
copolymer, a strong p-doping is deduced from the QHE measurement shown in 
Figure 9.2. One could achieve lower doping (i.e., sufficiently close to the Dirac 
point), by a shorter annealing period.

hours in a dry-nitrogen oven. The sample was next 
coated with 55 nm copolymer, bonded on  a chip

A3. Influence of Ar flow-rate on conventional epitaxial 
growth of buffer layer 

Figure 9.3 shows the influence of the argon mass flow rate on buffer layer growth 
on the samples without polymer preparation that are investigated by AFM and 
SEM. Three samples Sꞌ0, Sꞌ100, and Sꞌ1000 are 4H-SiC with a nominal miscut of about 
-0.06° towards 
and were processed at 1400 °C (1 bar argon atm., for 30 
min) at different Ar flow of 0, 100, and 1000 sccm, respectively. This experiment 
was carried out under the same conditions like the one in Chapter 5, and it aims 
to  study  the  influence  of  argon  flow  on  samples  grown  from  another  SiC 
polytype (4H-SiC) in the absence of polymer preparation.  

[1100] 

For the high argon flow of 1000 sccm, the sample’s surface undergoes strong step 
bunching without any buffer layer growth Figure 9.3g, h, i. This is similar to the 
PASG sample in Chapter 5 (see Figure 5.1g, h, i). In both cases, the high Ar flow 
leads  to  surface  etching.  For  moderate  Ar  flow,  however,  the  situation  is 
different. The surface of the sample without polymer preparation shows stripes 
of the covered buffer layer and bare SiC, Figure 9.3d, e, f. This is in contrast to 

153

the  PASG  sample  (Figure  5.1d,  e,  f)  where  the  provided  carbon  species  from 
polymer  lead  to  surface  super-saturation  and  well  buffer  layer  coverage, 
although the Ar flow caused canyon-like defects. For the case of zero argon flow 
(Figure 9.3a, b, c), the surface looks very good with uniform coverage, while the 
terraces appear less ordered in comparison with the PASG sample (Figure 5.1a, 
b, c).

sccm), (b) Sꞌ100 (Ar/100 sccm), and (c) Sꞌ1000 (Ar/1000 sccm). The sample was grown by 
typical sublimation growth without polymer preparation. Sꞌ0 processed under no Ar flow 
representing  good  buffer  layer  coverage  in  AFM  phase  (b)  and  scanning  electron

growth, causing the formation of buffer layer stripes on this sample, as can be seen in the 
AFM phase (e) and SEM (f) images. The intensive argon flux on S'1000 prevents buffer layer 
formation and results in severe step bunching on this sample (g), (h), (i).

A4. Formation of triangular-shaped structures 

It is observed that the increase of the Ar flow leads to the formation of triangular-
like structures. This can be seen in Figure 9.3g, h, and i, (and also refs. [37,38]) 
for the sample processed under 1000 sccm Ar flow. Also, rather increase of the 
Ar flow escalates the density of such structures, as shown in Figure 9.4 for the 
sample processed at 1400 °C (30 min, 1 bar Ar) in the presence of the Ar flow of 
2000 sccm. The aggregated mass along with the giant steps and the triangular-
like  structures  is  the  typical  morphology  all  over  the  surface  of  this  sample. 
Although,  here,  the  properties  of  such  triangular-shaped  structures  have  not 
been further studied, however, they very resemble the cubic SiC grown on other 
substrates elsewhere. [374,375]

Moreover, such triangle-shape structures appear not merely under intensive gas 
flow  but  also  under  a  lower  pressure  condition.  Figure  9.5  shows  AFM 
inspection on the surface of a 6H-SiC sample, which is processed at 50 mbar (1400 
°C, 30 min). The triangle-like structures appear to cover the substrate entirely.

Figure 9.6. Triangular-like structures in SiC/G. 
AFM topography and phase images indicate that the triangular-like structures can also be 
formed in epigraphene samples. 

Moreover,  triangular-like  structures  can  also  be  formed  during  the  graphene 
growth,  see  Figure  9.6.  Such  so-called  nanoprisms  in  the  SiC  substrate  were 
recently reported to be able to generate strain-induced uniform fields of ~41 T, 
enabling the observation of strain-induced Landau levels at room temperature. 
[38,365,366] Considering the orientation of the triangular structures, it is noticed 
that they are dispersed on the surface of the sample, interestingly, either at 0°, 
120°  or  180°  with  respect  to  each  other,  most  likely  due  to  the  staking  fault 
regions in the bottom substrate.   

A5. Step-retraction model of 6H-SiC/G 
The step flow model for 6H-SiC/G was described in Chapter 7 is shown here in 
more detail. Figure 9.7 shows the proposed step-flow model, which combines 
the  AFM  experiments  results,  illustrates  that  the  decomposition  of  6H-SiC 
terrace-step leads to three types of step-bunching scenarios: (i) terraces appear 
in pairwise sequences with a bilayer (1L) and 2L steps terminating to S3/S3* and 
S2/S2*,  respectively,  (ii)  3L  steps  terminating  to  S3/S3*,  or  (iii)  3L  steps 
terminating  to  S2/S2*.  Each  of  these  situations  represents  a  step  sequence  in 
which the attained termination is accompanied by the lowest surface energy.

(a)  Initial  state:  three  different  terraces  (step-heights  ~0.25  nm)  types  named  S3/S3, 
S2/S2*, and S1/S1* shape the surface of 6H-SiC before the growth. These terminations have 
inequivalent surface energies, which lead to different surface decomposition velocities. (b) 
After intermediate annealing (buffer layer growth) at about 1300-1400 °C, the S1/S1* with 
the  highest  surface  energy  (lower  stability)  disappears,  leaving  the  surface  with  two 
remaining surfaces of S2/S2* and S3/S3* which govern the step bunching for the rest of 
the growth. As a result, the terrace widths of S2/S2* is smaller than S3/S3*.  
(c) Since the decomposition velocity of S3/S3* is faster than S2/S2*, the latter extends in 
width as the surface undergoes further recrystallization and restructuring. Three terrace-
step configurations are identified: orange color (i) sequential pattern of steps with heights

A6. Influence of SiC polytype in substrate-induced doping  

Considering the stacking order-induced doping variation that was found for 6H-
SiC/G, it is interesting to study this effect in the 4H polytype too. As illustrated 
in Figure 9.8, the 4H-SiC is composed of 4 Si
C bilayers, in which two of those 
are energetically different (i.e., S2/S2* and S1/S1*), thereby leads to two distinct 
types of decomposition velocities, indicated by horizontal arrows in as shown in 
Figure  9.8. However, similar to  the  6H polytype, the Sn and  Sn* terminations 
have the same structure except for 60° crystal rotation with respect to each other. 
The 4H-SiC, in Figure 9.8, has hexagonal symmetry with 50% hexagonality owns 
an equal number of hexagonal and cubic stacking layers. For the 8 atoms in the 
unit  cell  of  the  4H  polytype,  2  are  non-equivalent  for  both  Si  and  C  atoms 
regarding their positions as of hexagonal (h) or cubic (k), as each is depicted in 
Figure 9.8. The hexagonality of each surface terrace can be considered as the joint 
hexagonality of the corresponding on- and off-bonds, shown in Figure 9.8.  

−

The  identification  of  the  4H-SiC  terminations  after  graphene  growth  can  be 
described in a framework of the step-flow model. The concept of the step-flow 
model for the 4H-SiC/G is similar to the 6H-SiC/G (see Chapter 7 and Figure 9.7) 
with less complexity. Let us see the experimental result of graphene growth on 
4H–SiC, as demonstrated in Figure 9.9. Figure 9.9 shows the AFM topography, 
phase, and step height profile of a 4H-SiC/G sample. At first sight, a sequential 
steps pattern, like for the 6H-SiC/G (Figure 7.2), is not observed. [39] This is due 
to the nature of the 4H-SiC and  the  number of stacking layers in its primitive 
unit  cell  that  register a  different  shape  of  step  patterns,  in  comparison  to  6H-
SiC/G.  The  sample’s  topography  clearly 
indicates  the  uniformity  and 
homogeneity  of  the  graphene  growth  on  this  polytype  as  the  terraces-steps 
regularly shaping the surface as on the 6H-SiC. However, interestingly,  phase 
contrast is randomly observed in the AFM phase image of this sample too, which 
is highlighted with green color marks in Figure 9.9. Alike already proved for the 
6H-SiC/G, it can be reasonably expected that the origin of the phase contrast in 
the AFM phase image of the 4H-SiC/G sample is again rooted in the dissimilarity 
of  the  SiC  surface  terminations.  This  can  be  simply  examined  as  follows.  By 
knowing that the S2/S2* terminations are the most stable ones, reasonably, these 
terminations  are  most  likely  the  last  standing  terraces  remaining  below  the 
graphene and buffer layers after the growth. Accordingly, it can be deduced that 
the  brighter  phase  contrast  in  the  AFM  phase  images  which  statistically  have 
higher distribution are S2/S2*, and the randomly distributed terraces with darker 
contrasts are S1/S1*. Keeping this in mind, we can subsequently map the surfaces 
in  the  step-height  profile  (terraces-steps  aligned  downwards),  as  shown  in 
Figure 9.9. To do so, by considering the experimentally measured step heights, 

159 

APPENDIX  

we can go downwards from one terrace to the next terrace and identify each one 
with respect to the stacking order in the unit cell and the distance that we walk 
downward (1L, 2L, 3L, etc.). This mapping is shown in Figure 9.9, wherein each 
terrace is marked with white color and the step-height with a highlighted yellow 
color. As can be seen in Figure 9.9, the initiation of the mapping started with S2 
(it  could  also  be  S2*,  but  it  does  not  change  the  mapping  process  drastically 
because Sn and Sn* are similar except for their 60° crystal rotation with respect 
to each other).  

The mapping of terraces fits captivatingly with the expectations considered and 
discussed above, and it shows that the phase contrasts are is only observed on 
dissimilar  terraces  terminations.  Accordingly,  the  darker  and  brighter  AFM 
phase  contrasts  belong  to  S1/S1*  and  S2/S2*,  respectively.  It  is  worthwhile  to 
mention that this phenomenon is not an accident but observed and examined on 
many samples, therefore it can be considered as a general fact, as it was already 
cleared for the 6H-SiC/G.

Also, the LEEM investigations on a 4H-SiC/G sample are in agreement with the 
step-flow  model  and  AFM  studies.  The  LEEM-BF  in  Figure  9.9  reveals  a 
reflectivity contrast on the neighboring terraces. More importantly, although the 
LEEM-IV spectra on these  areas indicate  a single prominent minimum, which 
clearly verifies the formation of monolayer graphene on both terrace domains 
[23,344],  however,  again  the  LEEM-IV  spectra  on  the  adjacent  terraces  reveal 
graphene with an energy difference of about ~60 meV. This is attributed to the 
two bottom non-equal terminations, i.e., S2/S2* and S1/S1* on 4H-SiC, leading 
into modulations of electronic properties of top graphene layers. [78] 

A7. Al2O3 encapsulation 

It  is  important  to  protect  the  graphene  layers  from  possible  defects  and 
adsorbates,  e.g.,  during  lithography  processes  (e.g.,  see  Figure  8.4)  or 
environmental influences (e.g.,  see  Figure  9.12). A  solution  could  be an initial 
passivation/encapsulation  of  a  metal  or  dielectric  layer,  which  can  be  later 
structured or removed. Figure 9.10 demonstrates two examples of this approach 
by the deposition of a 5nm Al2O3 layer (by ALD method).

from  the  typical  sample
s  quality.  The  impact  of  such  miscut  angle  deviations  on,  e.g., 
electronic properties of the graphene layer, requires further investigation. 

A9. Deformation of epitaxial graphene 

’

This section is devoted to an observation regarding graphene deformation under 
different conditions. This deformation appears as cracks and protrusion areas, 
as  well  as  dot-like  defects  on  the  graphene  samples.  In  the  following,  this 
observation  by  various  characterization  techniques  is  demonstrated.  Figure 
9.12a-c shows AFM and Raman investigation on pure monolayer graphene on 
6H-SiC  with  a  pairwise  step-terrace  configuration  of  ~0.25/~0.5  nm.  This  is 
named the 1st measurement. In chapters 5-8, different characterization methods 
verified  the  high-quality  of  the  samples  with  almost  vanishing  resistance 
anisotropy.  [36–39]  The  2nd  measurement  was  performed  on  the  same  sample 
after being kept for about 3 months in a sample box in the office under ambient 
condition. Surprisingly, the AFM topography and phase images in Figure 9.12d 
and  e  show  the  appearance  of  cracks  and  protrusion  areas  in  the  sample,  not 
only at the step regions but also on terraces. The Raman spectroscopy indicates 
the formation of the bilayer graphene, see Figure 9.12f. The depth of cracks and 
the height of protrusion areas are almost 1 nm, inferred from the AFM height 
profile and STM image in Figure 9.12g and h.

Almost a similar effect was observed during the SEM and LEEM scanning of the 
sample.  Figure  9.13a  shows  SEM  imaging  a  pure  6H-SiC/G  sample,  which 
deforms  upon  exposure  to  electron  microscopy  and  cracks  dot-like  defects 
appear  on  the  surface.  In  LEEM  imaging,  which  applies  electrons  with  much 
lower energy, interestingly more dot-like defects are created, see Figure 9.13b.

lab) inspection (b), the surface after 10 min deforms, and plenty of dot-like defects generate 
on the surface.

A  much  stronger  deformation  was  observed  when  the  samples  were 
intercalated.  Accordingly,  applying  a  simple  cleaning  in  acetone/isopropanol 
mixture  and  ultrasonic  bath  led  to  severe  damages  of  the  quasi-freestanding 
bilayer graphene sample. Figure  9.14 shows an optical microscope image  of a 
QFBLG  sample  after  the  abovementioned  simple  cleaning.  While  on  the  right 
side,  the  graphene  is  still  healthy  and  well-ordered  (terrace-steps  can  still  be 
identified),  on  the  left  side,  the  graphene  is  almost  heavily  destroyed  and 
removed  from  the  surface.  The  possible  origins  were  shortly  discussed  in 
Chapter 9.

superconducting heterostack 

Epitaxial graphene growth on silicon carbide (SiC/G) is an excellent method for 
obtaining  sizeable  graphene  layers,  a  versatile  platform  for  the  fabrication  of 
other  sub-dimensional  materials  too.  Accordingly,  we  fabricated  a  graphene-

metallene  2D  heterostacks  of  Van  der  Waals  combined  2D-layers  of  bilayer 
graphene (BLG) and gallium stacking layers on SiC substrate (SiC/Ga/BLG). [43] 

Figure 9.15a shows the optical microscope image demonstrating the propagation 
of gallium into SiC/G, which lies in between the bottom SiC and top graphene 
layers.  The  AFM  topography  image  in  Figure  9.15b  highlights  the  excellent 
homogeneity of the samples regarding the small step heights (mostly < 1 nm). 
The ultra-smooth morphology of the SiC/G as a result of effective suppression of 
surface  step-bunching  during  the  epitaxial  growth  facilitates  a  homogenous 
formation of 2D-Ga layers. [41] The AFM image was captured at a border region 
where the SiC/G and SiC/Ga/BLG coexist. This material difference is projected in 
the optical microscopy contrast observable in the AFM phase image in  Figure 
9.15c, as marked by the dashed blue line. The brighter belongs to the SiC/G, and 
the darker arises from the SiC/Ga/BLG. For more detail, see ref. [43]. Although a 
precise  explanation  of  the  intercalation  mechanism  is  yet  needed  to  be 
understood  [41,43],  however,  there  is  experimental  evidence  that  the  intrinsic 
SiC  micropipes  and  additional  holes  induced  by  the  growth  process  (Figure 
9.15b,c) as "mediation sites" utilize the Ga intercalation without the necessity of 
further defect engineering, e.g., by using oxygen plasma. [41,43] 

The  VdP  measurements  were  carried  out  in  a  cryostat  system  equipped  with 
helium-4 (4He) continuous flow that enables measurements at temperatures in 
the  range  from  ~1.5 K  to  ~350 K  under  a  homogenous  magnetic  field  (B) 
between  0 to 250 mT  provided  by  the  Helmholtz  coil  (see  Chapter  3  for  more 
detail). For the measurement, the samples were first to cut into a square shape of 
5 mm × 5 mm. The graphene/gallenene on top of the sample was isolated from 
the graphene on the side and the back (C-side) of the substrate by scribing cut-
grooves on each side close to the edge of the sample (~0.1-0.2 mm from the edge) 
[38], as can be seen in Figure 9.16a. In the VdP setup, the sample was connected 
directly with gold pins which were softly approached and fixed on the sample 
by a holding upper cap close to the corners of the sample, as depicted by yellow 
circles  and  a  notation  letter  (i.e.,  A,  B,  E,  D)  in  Figure  9.16a.  The  proper 
functionality of all contacts was carefully checked via I-V measurement. From 
the  linear  ohmic  characteristic  of  all  the  contacts  in  Figure  9.16b,  a  lateral 
homogeneity in the VdP is inferred. From the standard approach of Hall effect 
measurement  in  the  VdP  setup,  that  is  already  significant  since  it  verifies  the 
crystallinity of the grown sample over mm-scale; otherwise, the sample would 
have  deemed  improper  for  the  VdP  measurements.  A  slight  difference  in 
diagonal I-V measurements for AE and DB is observed, which could be due to a 
bit  of  inequality  of  the  local  contact  resistances,  however,  its  influence  is 
negligible in the VdP measurement.

For the Hall measurement, while the magnetic field switched on, the current was

the other diagonal (i.e., EA or DB). For each case, the measurement was repeated

out  in  wide  temperature  and  current  ranges.  Figure  9.16c,  d  demonstrate  the 
VdP measurement performed at 1.7 K and 4.2 K both at a current of I = 10 µA. 
While  the  material  system  demonstrates  a  normal  conductor  state  for  T > 4 K 
(Figure 9.16d), interestingly, it exhibits a superconducting transition phase and 
Meissner state for T < 4 K. 

This  is  the  general  feature  of  the  sample  in  the  presented  measurements  for 
different  applied  currents  and  temperatures  up  to  100  µA,  and  ~4  K, 
respectively.  The  SiC/Ga/BLG  is  settled  in  Meissner  state  for  B < ~10  mT 
(highlighted by the green circle in Figure 9.16c), and correspondingly, the Hall 
potential  and  resistance  are  zero.  For  B > 10 mT,  the  sample  is  in  transitional 
phase (mixed state) before dropping into the normal phase where it behaves like 
a  normal  metal  with  the  electron  charge  carrier  (n-type)  that  can  be  inferred 
considering the ramp of the Hall resistance and magnetic field direction. In the 
mixed-phase,  the  sample  indeed  behaves  like  a  type-II  superconductor  [376], 
wherein the resistance increases abruptly up to a second critical magnetic field. 
It  begins  then  to  pass  to  the  normal  phase.  The  slope  of  the  mixed-phase  is 
directly  proportional  to  the  applied  current  and  carrier  concentration  in  the 
system.  Thereby,  raising  the  applied  current  leads  to  a  faster  transition  to the 
normal state. However, to what extent the temperature drifts is yet not known. 
This  situation  can  be  deduced  from  Figure  9.16e,  which  shows  the  VdP 
measurement (across EA) at 1.7 K for I = 100 µA (violet circles). Comparing the 
results in Figure 9.16c and e, it is seen when the current increases, the transition 
from  superconducting  to  mixed-state  occurs  at  lower  B.  Also,  the  resistance 
change in the mixed-state is slower. However, the slope of the Hall resistance in 
the normal phase remains almost unchanged for the whole range of current and 
correspondingly the charge carrier concentration (n or p), mobility (µ), and sheet 
resistance (Rs) too. 

Considering the characteristic feature of the mixed-phase, it is important to take 
into account the main three components involved in the transverse Hall voltage: 
(i) geometrical misalignment of the contacts (ii) Hall voltage component, and (iii) 
contribution from the guided motion of vortex and antivortex. [377] The case (i) 
can be excluded, otherwise, its contribution could be detected as a non-zero Hall 
voltage at normal state measurements in zero magnetic fields.  [378] However, 
the role of the two other contributors and possible interplays, e.g., a proximity 
effect, sign reversal effect [379], pinning effect [380], or weak coupling [381] for 
the observed behavior in the mixed-phase in this complex stacking system is not 
yet clear and requires further investigation. 

The  VdP  method  facilitates  measuring  the  carrier  density  and  mobility  as  a 
 1.3 ± 0.1 × 1012 cm
function of temperature in the sample.[210] Thereby, an n

2, and µ

−
well as the metallic intercalation agent (Ga), which turns the free-standing top 
graphene  bilayer  to  n-type  but  not  p-type  as  it  is  the  case,  e.g.,  for  hydrogen 
intercalation. [30,38] At room temperature, the mobility diminishes with a factor 
of  approximately  5  times  down  to  ~300 ± 50 cm2/Vs  with  an  n 
 4.5 ± 0.1 × 
1012 cm
2, following the saying "poor conductors at room temperature tends to 
be a better superconductor." This is in contrast to QFMLG, which its mobility is 
−
almost  constant  both  at  room  and  low  temperatures.  The  electron-phonon 
coupling which mediates the superconducting behavior is also the main reason 
for the lower mobility of the gallenene sample measured at room temperature. 

≈

≈

Not  meeting gallenene,  two  other  systems  in  the  family  of  epitaxial  graphene 
were  investigated:  one  epitaxial  SiC/G,  which  after  applying  H-intercalation, 
turned  to  QFBLG.  Figure  9.16g  shows  the  VdP  measurements,  performed  on 
5×5 mm2 samples at both room- and cold temperatures. 

From the slopes in Figure 9.16g, an n-type and p-type doping is deduced for the 
SiC/G  and  QFBLG  samples,  respectively.  The  so-called  polarization  doping 
originating from the bulk hexagonal SiC leads to negative pseudo-charges at the 
surface,  which  is  compensated  by  holes  in  the  quasi-freestanding  graphene 
layers for the sake of charge neutrality, leading into p-doping. The polarization 
doping effect, however, is overcompensated by donor-like states from the buffer 
layer and interface states, which results in the Dirac point be located below the 
Fermi energy in epigraphene and thus its n-type conductivity (see section 2.4.4 
for more information). [30,31] 

Moreover, the SiC/Ga/BLG sample, in comparison with the QFBLG sample that 
was fabricated employing hydrogen intercalation in the same VdP measurement 
scales [38], exhibits much lower mobility; both at room and low temperatures, 
indicating  higher  scattering  in  SiC/Ga/BLG  system.  Additionally,  the  QFBLG 
graphene sample does not show any  superconducting effect in the absence  of 
2D-Ga, which excludes the participation of low-angle twisted BLG effect in the 
samples.  [382]  Also,  the  significantly  lower  carrier  density  in  our  system 
compared to lithium [45] and calcium [283] doped SiC/G samples, rules out the 
the 
argument  of  strong  electron-phonon  coupling  as 
superconductivity in the SiC/Ga/BLG. Therefore, it is concluded that the 2D-Ga 
is responsible for the  superconductivity, which is in excellent  agreement  with 
the recent valuable study by Briggs et al. [41]

APPENDIX  

In summary, a dc Hall measurement in Van der Pauw configuration of a large-
area  2D-gallium  sheet  was  presented.  The  2D-Ga  sheet  was  grown  on 
epigraphene,  forming  a  stacking  system  of  SiC/Ga/BLG.  The  measurements 
show  the  superconducting  nature  of  2D-Ga  at    T < 4 K,  in  agreement  with 
another  recent  study  performed  on  a  µm-scale.  [41]  The  Hall  effect 
measurements give evidence of type-II like superconducting behavior. [376] It is 
shown that the phase transition between the normal and superconductive states 
is not the first order in the presence of a magnetic field but up to four-order-of-
magnitude.  The  complex  behavior  of  the  stacking  system  in  the  intermediate 
state  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  presented  work  and  motivates  further 
experimental  and  theoretical  investigations.  The  high  charge  mobility  value 
highlights the high-quality of the sample over mm-scales. Also, from the linear 
ohmic  I-V  characteristic  of  contacts,  the  high  homogeneity  of  the  sample  is 
deduced, given further proof of the large-area growth of the 2D-Ga sheet. This 
in  2D-device  electronic 
study  supports  the  potential  metallic  contacts 
applications.  Moreover,  the  atop  graphene  layers  can  prospectively  be 
implemented  for  proceeding  the  creation  of  other  exotic  layers  enabling 
exploring  physical  and  electronic  properties  in  such  combined  hybrid 
heterostack systems.

throughout  these  years  of  academic  research  at  the  PTB  and  the  Leibniz 
University Hannover. It was an incredibly beautiful time, and I learned a lot. I 
also  would  like  to  sincerely  thank  Prof.  Dr.  Christoph  Tegenkamp  for  his 
support, fruitful discussions, and the many excellent pieces of advice that have 
contributed to the success of our joint publications. I am also very thankful to 
Prof. Dr. Siegner for the support of the projects and my position. 

I  would  like  to  particularly  thank  Dr. Klaus  Pierz  for  his  continuous  support, 
valuable discussions, and most importantly, his patience and friendship during 
my studies at the PTB. I have also learned and improved a lot my German during 
our discussions, Klaus, vielen Dank! 

I  also  had  the  pleasure  of  collaborating  with  different  excellent  groups  that  I 
would like to address my thanks. Special thanks to Prof. Dr. Thomas Seyller and 
his  group,  Philip  Schädlich,  and  Dr.  Florian  Speck  from  the  University  of 
Chemnitz  for  precious  discussions,  LEEM,  and  XPS  measurements,  and  our 
successful  joint  publications.  Many  thanks  to  Prof.  Dr.  Christoph  Tegenkamp 
and his group, Dr. Johannes Aprojanz, T. T. N. Nguyen, Jan P. Stöckmann, and 
Dr. Jens Baringhaus from University of Chemnitz/ Leibniz University Hannover 
for SEM, STM, and nano-four-point-probe measurements. I would like to thank 
PD. Dr. Martin Wenderoth and his group, Anna Sinterhauf, Georg A. Traeger, 
Dr. Philip Willke from the University of Göttingen for productive discussions, 
and STM/STP measurements. Thanks extend to Prof. Dr. Winfried Daum and his 
group, Wanja Dziony, Dr. Gerhard Lilienkamp, from the Technical University of 
Clausthal for XPS measurements. Many thanks to Prof. Dr. Andrey Bakin from 
TU Braunschweig for the valuable discussion and his willingness to collaborate. 
I  am  also  very  grateful  to  Dr.  Alexei  A.  Zakharov  for  the  indispensable 
discussions, LEEM, and XPEEM measurements.  

I  extend  my  gratitude  to  my  colleagues  at  the  PTB  for  their  camaraderie, 
kindness, and support. I would like to express my thanks to Thorsten Dziomba,
