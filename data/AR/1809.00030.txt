ABSTRACT

The desire for higher sensitivity has driven ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments to
employ ever larger focal planes, which in turn require larger reimaging optics. Practical limits to the maximum
size of these optics motivates the development of quasi-optically-coupled (lenslet-coupled), multi-chroic detectors.
These detectors can be sensitive across a broader bandwidth compared to waveguide-coupled detectors. However,
the increase in bandwidth comes at a cost: the lenses (up to ∼700 mm diameter) and lenslets (∼5 mm diameter,
hemispherical lenses on the focal plane) used in these systems are made from high-refractive-index materials
(such as silicon or amorphous aluminum oxide) that reﬂect nearly a third of the incident radiation. In order
to maximize the faint CMB signal that reaches the detectors, the lenses and lenslets must be coated with an
anti-reﬂective (AR) material. The AR coating must maximize radiation transmission in scientiﬁcally interesting
bands and be cryogenically stable. Such a coating was developed for the third generation camera, SPT-3G, of the
South Pole Telescope (SPT) experiment, but the materials and techniques used in the development are general
to AR coatings for mm-wave optics. The three-layer polytetraﬂuoroethylene-based AR coating is broadband,
inexpensive, and can be manufactured with simple tools. The coating is ﬁeld tested; AR coated focal plane
elements were deployed in the 2016-2017 austral summer and AR coated reimaging optics were deployed in
2017-2018.

1. INTRODUCTION

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) encodes a wealth of information about our universe: the temperature
anisotropy tells us about primordial density ﬂuctuations;1 measurements of the temperature power spectrum
indicate the curvature and composition of the early universe;2, 3 the polarization anisotropy gives us information
about the energy scale of inﬂation.4 Detailed measurements of CMB properties serve to further our understanding
of fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics. Demand for higher sensitivity has pushed the CMB
community to design experiments with large optical elements and large focal planes. One such experiment is the
South Pole Telescope’s (SPT) third generation camera, called SPT-3G.

SPT-3G, deployed in the austral summer of 2016-2017, is designed to achieve a roughly order-of-magnitude
increase in mapping speed over its predecessor thanks to its wide-ﬁeld optics that illuminate the entire focal plane
and its broadband pixels,5 which are a departure from optical chain and detector coupling designs of previous

CMB experiments.6–12 As current CMB detector technology is sensitvity-limited by photon shot noise, one way
to boost an experiment’s overall sensitivity is to increase the size of the focal plane (i.e., the total number of
detectors). There is, however, a practical upper limit to the area of a focal plane: for the materials and processes
currently used in the CMB ﬁeld, it becomes diﬃcult (and expensive) to manufacture high-refractive-index lenses
as they approach ∼1 m diameter. Rather than increasing the physical area of the focal plane, another way
to increase overall sensitivity is by increasing the bandwidth of the focal plane. Multi-chroic detectors (i.e.,
detectors sensitive to more than one bandpass, or color) include multiple colors within the same pixel footprint,
which allows for eﬃcient use of the limited focal plane area by increasing the total bandwidth of each pixel.

SPT-3G employs high-refractive-index reimaging lenses and microfabricated arrays of polarization-sensitive,
multi-chroic pixels on the focal plane. Each pixel consists of a broadband, planar, log-periodic sinuous antenna,
sensitive to two linear polarizations of light. Each polarization element is coupled to transition edge sensors
(TES) tuned to 95, 150, and 220 GHz with ∼30% bandwidth in each spectral band.13, 14 In total, there are six
bolometers per pixel. The multi-chroic nature of each individual pixel translates to greater total bandwidth on
the focal plane than achieved in previous CMB experiments. Additionally, SPT-3G’s use of high-refractive-index,
wide-ﬁeld optics allows for a large focal plane area, which in turn allows for a large absolute number of detectors.

In the case of SPT-3G, the wide-ﬁeld optics are ∼720 mm in diameter and made from amorphous aluminum
oxide (Al2O3; henceforth, alumina). There are three alumina lenses and one alumina infrared ﬁlter in the SPT-
3G optical chain; the ﬁnal focusing elements (arrays of 5 mm diameter hemispherical lenslets) are also made
from alumina (Figure 1). Due to the high refractive index of alumina (n ≈ 3), nearly 30% of incident radiation
is reﬂected at each alumina surface. Since CMB detectors are sensitivity-limited by photon shot noise, the
reﬂection and scattering of CMB photons away from detectors has a direct impact on the overall sensitivity of
the experiment. Furthermore, increased reﬂection leads to increased thermal loading throughout the interior of
the experiment, which can in turn lead to challenges in managing the cryogenic environment. Consequently,
minimizing loss due to reﬂections is a high priority.

Single-layer and two-layer anti-reﬂective (AR) coatings that provide good single- and dual-band coverage
have been developed and demonstrated.15–19 In this work we present a three-layer polytetraﬂuoroethylene-based
(PTFE) millimeter wave AR coating, developed for the SPT-3G camera and operational in the ﬁeld since 2016.
In Sec. 2 we address the design requirements for the SPT-3G AR coating; in Sec. 3 we describe how the coating
is fabricated. We present measurements of the coating’s performance in Sec. 4, discuss our results in Sec. 5, and
draw conclusions in Sec. 6.

The initial development and materials selection for the SPT-3G AR coating were made in the context of the focal
plane’s lenslet arrays (271-element arrays composed of 5 mm diameter, hemispherical alumina lenses), the ﬁnal

element in the optical chain. After the initial deployment of SPT-3G, we adapted the AR coating materials and
the techniques we had developed to the large-format lenses for the second season of operation. When designing
the SPT-3G AR coating, we required that the end product must: 1) provide AR coverage from ∼80 GHz to
∼260 GHz; 2) conform to high-curvature surfaces; 3) be able to be fabricated en masse, rather than for each
optical element individually.

√

A perfect single frequency coating AR coating is one quarter-wavelength thick at the target frequency,
and has a refractive index equal to the geometric mean of the incident and terminal media refractive indices:
ninf . This type of coating is the thinnest possible conﬁguration for a given frequency and AR coating
nAR =
material. Minimizing the thickness of an AR coating is important because physical materials are lossy. The
refractive index of physical media are generally complex-valued, with the non-zero imaginary part describing
electromagnetic attenuation within those media – and dielectric loss is proportional to material thickness (and
frequency). Conversely, a (nearly) perfect broadband coating is one that approximates a Klopfenstein taper,20 a
well-known microwave transmission line impedance transformer. The analogous AR coating is one that gradu-
ally and continuously transitions from the refractive index of the incident medium to the refractive index of the
terminal medium. In the case of SPT-3G, such a coating would vary smoothly and continuously from n = 1,
the refractive index of vacuum, to n ≈ 3, the refractive index of alumina (which is similar to that of silicon).
In practice, a Klopfenstein-approximate coating would not only be diﬃcult to manufacture, but it would also
be thick. A thick coating, while perhaps providing better AR properties, will cause more attenuation than a
thinner coating.

An intermediate conﬁguration composed of multiple discrete layers, each with a distinct refractive index, is
a compromise between narrow AR coverage with low loss and broad AR coverage with high loss. Commercial
thermoplastic sheets are well-suited to this intermediate conﬁguration. The electrical properties and physical
dimensions of thermoplastics used in microwave engineering applications are strictly controlled, making it easier
to create a consistent, layered coating.
In addition, thermoplastics have previously been used as single-layer
coatings for high-curvature lenslets.15

Previous CMB AR coating development21 determined that our ideal AR coating should have three layers,
and that each discrete layer should have refractive index 1.41, 2.0, and 2.65 and thickness 331, 234, and 171
µm, respectively. These refractive indices and thicknesses comprise an AR coating optimized for transmission
at 160 GHz that has a broad enough response to cover our low (95 GHz) and high (220 GHz) bands. However,
commercially available thermosplastics with arbitrary refractive index and thickness are not readily available.
Therefore, we chose materials with characteristics as close to the ideal values as possible.

We found that commercially available PTFE-based products most closely satisﬁed our refractive index and
curvature requirements. In its raw state, PTFE is a powder which can be cast and sintered, or extruded to
produce a wide range of shapes. Because of its favorable properties (e.g., low dielectric loss and coeﬃcient of
friction, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability) PTFE has seen widespread use in communications and microwave
engineering applications. The electrical properties of raw PTFE can be modiﬁed by changes to the powder
mixture before sintering (e.g., additives) and other processes. Each layer comprising the SPT-3G AR coating
has undergone some form of additional processing.

For the low-index layer we chose porous PTFE (Porex for lenslet arrays and Zitex for large-format optics),
while for the middle- and high-index layers we chose ﬁlled PTFE (Rogers Corporation RO3035 bondply and
Rogers Corporation RO3006 bondply, respectively). Porous PTFE has a lower refractive index than pure, non-
porous PTFE, whereas ﬁlled PTFE (which often includes additives such as high-index ceramics or glass) have
a higher refractive index than pure PTFE. Table 1 contains details of the properties of each AR layer. The
materials we chose are available as 18 x 24 x 0.005 inch sheets (RO3035 and RO3006), 13 x 0.015 inch rolls of
arbitrary length (Porex), and 10 x 0.015 inch rolls of arbitrary length (Zitex). Zitex, which has similar properties
to Porex, was chosen for the large-format optics because it is less expensive and has a shorter manufacturing
lead time.

Using the transfer matrix method,22 we simulated transmission for a range of layer conﬁgurations and found
that one stock-thickness layer of each material was an acceptable compromise between coating thickness and
overall transmission. The thickness constraint of the coating was driven mainly by the pitch of the detector

pixels: 6.789 mm. A coating made too thick would cause adjacent pixels to physically interfere with each other.
Due to their diﬀerent geometries, the lenslet and large-format AR coating fabrication processes vary in how the
primary materials are made to adhere to each other and to the optical element. We describe the two fabrication
processes below.

3. FABRICATION

The SPT-3G focal plane is composed of ten modules. Each module has 271 pixels, and each pixel is quasi-optically
coupled by a hemispherical alumina lenslet that is 5 mm in diameter. Individually AR coating and assembling
lenslets was not feasible owing to the large number of lenslets per module and their dense packing (the lenslets
are centered on a 6.789 mm pitch; see Fig. 5). Consequently, we developed a high-throughput coating process
that enabled us to create a monolithic three-layer coating (i.e., without any bonding agent between layers) and,
as a separate step, apply it to the entire lenslet array at one time. Table 2 describes the approximate time
required per step for lenslet array fabrication. The large-format optics consist of three reimaging lenses and a
ﬂat infrared ﬁlter. The outer dimesion of these parts is ∼720 mm. The process we used for AR coating the
large-format optics is essentially an industrial vacuum bagging process. Table 3 describes the approximate time
required per step for coating large-format optics. Below, we give a brief overview of each process in turn.

3.1 Lenslet Coating

Fabrication of the lenslet AR coating begins with laminating the three diﬀerent layers together to make a
monolithic sheet, roughly 150 mm x 150 mm. We stack the three separate, PTFE-based sheets in a mold, apply
mechanical pressure to that mold, and then heat the entire assembly. As PTFE approaches its glass transition
temperature (∼390°C) it enters a gel-like state that resists deformation. Under heat and pressure, the PTFE
molecules coalesce and diﬀuse across the boundaries between the individual sheets. As the mold and coating is
slowly cooled, the coating solidiﬁes into a single sheet. Figure 2 (left panel) depicts the result of the lamination
process.

After the coating is laminated it is shaped to conform to the lenslet array. To shape the coating, we use a
screw-driven die press and system of molds (Fig. 2 right panel). The laminated sheet is aligned in the mold
and compressed until it reaches the appropriate curvature; the result is a sheet that mates directly to the lenslet
array. Following the molding process, the coating is secured to the lenslet array by a thin layer of Stycast 1266
applied to each lenslet; we chose Stycast 1266 for its low viscosity. The coated lenslet array is then returned to
the screw-driven die press and allowed to cure under pressure for at least 12 hours.

The ﬁnal step in the lenslet AR coating process is laser dicing the coating. Laser dicing is necessary to relieve
thermal stress that would be caused by diﬀerential thermal contraction between the PTFE and silicon lenslet
wafer. Without stress relief, a coated lenslet array cooled to ∼100K will shatter. We use a 30 W CO2 laser∗
to cut a hexagon around each lenslet, which decouples each lenslet from its neighbors and minimizes the total
contractile area of any one element (Fig. 5).

3.2 Large Format Optics Coating

Unlike the lenslet coating, where the PTFE layers are bonded directly together, the large optics coating employs
a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bonding layer between AR coating layers. The intermediate LDPE bonding
layers are used in the large-format coatings because it is diﬃcult to make a large enough lamination mold to
create monolithic sheets. LDPE begins to ﬂow at ∼110°C, below the glass transition temperature of PTFE
(∼390°C). Therefore, the primary AR coating materials remain stable while the LDPE melts and adheres to
them (in the case of the innermost layer, the LDPE adheres to the alumina as well).

A second reason for using the intermediate LDPE layers is that it becomes diﬃcult to ensure the coating lays
ﬂat on a curved surface as the thickness of the coating increases. We avoid the thickness problem by applying
only one AR layer at a time. This process means that the lens is baked a total of four times: once for each layer
and one ﬁnal baking to ensure that seams in the coating are properly adhered. Figure 3 shows an AR coated
SPT-3G lens, the result of our ﬁrst end-to-end attempt at the lens AR coating process.

Seams in the AR coating are an inevitable consequence of the form factor of the coating materials; namely,
the coating materials are not large enough to cover the large optics as a single sheet. Therefore, each layer
comprises multiple sheets, and the edges of those sheets overlap during baking. However, the overlapping edges
increase the layer thickness at the seams, which is undesirable. To avoid that extra thickness, we add a temporary
strip of pure PTFE between the LDPE layer and the position of the seam, which keeps the seam material from
adhering to the LDPE. The pure PTFE does not adhere well to the LDPE during baking and does not adhere
to the AR layer at all. The temporary strip is removed after the lens is taken out of the oven. We then remove
the excess overlapping material. We do this by using a razor to make a depth-controlled cut down the middle of

Figure 2. Left: A cross-section-view photograph of a laminated, monolithic, PTFE-based, three-layer AR coating as seen
in the infrared (scale is approximate). The distinct layers are visible: Porex (top, lowest index), RO3035 (middle, middle
index), RO3006 (bottom, highest index). The total thickness of the coating is ∼0.635 mm. Right: The screw-driven die

the long axis of the seam; we control the depth to avoid cutting any material below the seam. We then remove
the free-ﬂoating AR material, leaving the rest of the coating surface ﬂat. This process is repeated for each layer
of the AR coating. Table 3 gives a broad overview of the large optics AR coating process.

4. CHARACTERIZATION

The lenslet AR coating was measured by means of a Micheleson interferometer Fourier Transform Spectrometer
(FTS) at University of California Berkeley. The FTS consists of a modulated blackbody radiation source,
collimating optics, and a broadband detector.21 Generally, in FTS measurements the response of the system is
measured with a clear detector aperture, then the sample is placed in the aperture and its response is measured.

Two samples were measured, both were alumina pucks (CoorsTek formulation AD-995-I2 – the same formu-
lation as the lenslets) 2 inch outer diameter by 0.25 inch thick that were coated on both sides by the lenslet AR
coating. The coating response was measured between 50 and 300 GHz at ∼300 K. The results are shown in Fig.
4. In the left panel we show the response of the individual samples; in the right panel we show the averaged
response of the two samples and overlay the predicted response. Table 4 lists the mean in-band transmission for
Sample 1 and Sample 2, as well as the expected in-band transmission based on the model. The model takes into
account the refractive index, loss tangent, and thickness of each material; it also factors dielectric loss into its
output. We interpret the data below in Sec. 5.

In addition to measuring the transmission response of the coating, we also tested its mechanical robustness
to thermal cycling. Due to the mismatch in the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion of alumina/silicon and the
PTFE-based AR coating materials, it is possible for the AR coating to peel away from the optical element when
the assembly is cooled to cryogenic temperatures, especially over the course of several thermal cycles.

Early in the research and development process we stress tested the coated lenslet arrays by rapidly submerging
the assembly in liquid nitrogen (T=77 K), allowing it to thermalize, then removing the assembly from the liquid
nitrogen and allowing it to return to room temperature. The process was then repeated 20 times, or until the
coating failed. We found that if a coating did not peel away from the lenslet array after the ﬁrst two cycles,
then the coating tended to remain anchored for the remaining cycles. This test is far more extreme than any

surface is ∼700 mm. The outer lip of this lens (a non-optical, though mechanically important part) was damaged during
the AR coating process, but we adjusted the vacuum bagging procedure and no additional lenses were damaged.

scenario the lenslet arrays might face in normal operation. During production of the deployment-grade lenslet
arrays, we relaxed the passing conditions of the thermal cycling test; we instead required that the lenslet array
survive three slow thermal cycles.

We thermally tested the large-format optics as well. Due to their size and deployment schedule time con-
straints, however, we were unable test them as thoroughly as the lenslet arrays. The large-format optics were
similarly submerged in a liquid nitrogen bath and allowed to thermalize. Each optical element was thermally
cycled at least once before deployment and mechanical clamps were added around the perimeter of each lens to
prevent coating delamination.

5. DISCUSSION

We have developed a three-layer AR coating for the SPT-3G camera’s large-format optics and focal plane (Figs.
3 and 5, repsectively). The lenslet array AR coating is robust to thermal cycling; the large-format coating also
survives thermal cycling. While both coatings improve the overall transmission in the SPT-3G science bands, the
coating response deviates from what we expect based on our model, which underestimates transmission in the
95 and 150 GHz bands and overestimates it in the 220 GHz band. These diﬀerences, however, are not entirely
surprising. We use as input to our simulations commercial product speciﬁcations for the index of refraction and
loss tangents of each material, but these parameters are known to be both frequency- and temperature-dependent
and the values provided by manufacturers are derived from measurements made at frequencies below those of
our observing bands. We are in the process of preparing a Univeristy of Chicago-based Michelson FTS for the
purpose of measuring each AR coating material individually.

(Scales are approximate) Top left: An exploded-view schematic of the AR coating, lenslet, lenslet seating wafer,
and detector wafer with the index of refraction (IOR) called out for each material. Top right: A close-up photograph of a
lenslet array that has been assembled, AR coated, and laser diced. The high curvature and dense packing of the lenslets
is prominently featured. Bottom left: A photograph of an AR coated lenslet array. Each lenslet array consists of 271
hemispherical alumina lenslets mounted to a silicon substrate. The hexagonal silicon substrate is cut from a 6 in diameter
silicon wafer. Bottom right: A photograph of the SPT-3G focal plane taken just before its ﬁnal integration with the rest
of the instrument. The ten white hexagons are AR coated lenslet arrays.

We do not expect, however, that whatever discrepancies we ﬁnd between the lower-frequency speciﬁcation
values and the higher-frequency measurements will explain all of the model residuals. Of particular interest to us
is the averaged sample response’s dip in transmission above ∼200 GHz as compared to the model. It is unlikely
that this dip is due entirely to dielectric loss. For instance, in the right panel of Figure 4, we see that beginning
at about 220 GHz the peaks in the model curve fall out-of-sync with the averaged response curve. This shifting
is indicative of reﬂections between the AR coating layers and the alumina. Additionally, based on the model,
we expect a roughly three percent decrease in transmission due to loss in the 220 GHz band. While this may be
consistent with the 220 GHz band mean transmission of Sample 1, that sample’s response is artiﬁcially inﬂated
due to an imperfect reference measurement (in general, the fractional transmission should not exceed one). The
true value probably lies closer to the 220 GHz band mean transmission of Sample 2, which becomes harder
to explain through dielectric loss alone. A working hypothesis is that we see excess scattering with increasing
frequency due to the wavelength of the light approaching the size of the high-index dopants added to the RO3035
and RO3006 layers; we are currently exploring that mechanism.

Even if the model perfectly matched the measured response, there is still room to improve transmission,
especially in the 220 GHz band. Because total transmission, T , is exponentially dependent on the number of
optical surfaces, N , increasing transmission by any fraction is a worthwhile endeavor: T ∝ aN , where a is the
transmission through a single optical surface (assuming all surfaces are identical). While it is diﬃcult to change
the refractive index of the AR coating materials, we can adjust their thicknesses. By optimizing the thickness

of each layer we can increase transmission across all three science bands. We are currently exploring techniques
(e.g., industrial roll forming processes) to accurately and consistently adjust the thickness of the AR coating
materials.

We are in the early stages of research and development for a 30 to 40 GHz AR coating. While the ﬁelded
coating is lossy above 200 GHz, there is little loss in the 30 and 40 GHz bands – bands that are of particular
interest to the upcoming CMB Stage-4 (CMB-S4) experiment.27, 28 Preliminary simulations indicate that a
PTFE-based coating can achieve a ﬂat response at >95% transmission in the ∼25 to ∼45 GHz band. We have
constructed a prototype of such a coating using the same materials and techniques described above, and intend
to test the coating’s response later this year. Owing to the thickness of the coating, it more readily lends itself
to large-format optics rather than high-curvature lenslets.

6. CONCLUSION

We have developed a PTFE-based AR coating that is broadband, cryogenically stable, and inexpensive to
manufacture – the cost of the coating materials is ∼$960 per square meter. The cost of coating a six inch lenslet
array is ∼$20 and the cost of coating an entire large-format optic (approximately 720 mm outer diameter) is
∼$1250. The raw materials are commercially available and the coating can be fabricated in-house, leading to fast
design iteration. The coating is adaptable to both high-curvature lenslets and large diameter wide-ﬁeld optics.
In addition, the coating has been ﬁeld-tested – ten AR coated lenslet arrays were deployed with the SPT-3G
experiment in the 2016-2017 austral summer and AR coated wide-ﬁeld optics were deployed in the 2017-2018
austral summer.

The lenslet coating technique is scalable and several steps can be automated, further reducing manufacturing
time. Scalability and automation are attractive assets as the ground-based CMB research ﬁeld begins to prepare
for the near-future CMB-S4 experiment. Furthermore, the materials and techniques described above can be
applied to lower-frequency scientiﬁcally interesting bands.
