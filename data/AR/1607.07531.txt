ABSTRACT

Solar active regions (ARs) are the major sources of two kinds of the most
violent solar eruptions, namely ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The
largest AR in the past 24 years, NOAA AR 12192, crossed the visible disk from
2014 October 17 to 30, unusually produced more than one hundred ﬂares, includ-
ing 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, but only one small CME. Flares and CMEs
are believed to be two phenomena in the same eruptive process. Why is such a
ﬂare-rich AR so CME-poor? We compared this AR with other four ARs; two
were productive in both and two were inert. The investigation of the photo-
spheric parameters based on the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram reveals that the
ﬂare-rich AR 12192, as the other two productive ARs, has larger magnetic ﬂux,
current and free magnetic energy than the two inert ARs, but contrast to the two
productive ARs, it has no strong, concentrated current helicity along both sides
of the ﬂaring neutral line, indicating the absence of a mature magnetic structure
consisting of highly sheared or twisted ﬁeld lines. Furthermore, the decay index
above the AR 12192 is relatively low, showing strong constraint. These results
suggest that productive ARs are always large and have enough current and free
energy to power ﬂares, but whether or not a ﬂare is accompanied by a CME is
seemingly related to (1) if there is mature sheared or twisted core ﬁeld serving
as the seed of the CME, (2) if the constraint of the overlying arcades is weak
enough.

Introduction

Both solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) indicate the rapid release of a huge
amount of magnetic energy in the solar corona, and in particular, CMEs are the most impor-
tant driving source of hazardous space weather near the geospace. As the major producer of
ﬂares and CMEs, active regions (ARs) have been studied for decades. It was revealed based
on lots of observational studies that parameters characterizing the AR’s non-potentiality, e.g.,
shear length, magnetic gradient, total electric current, free energy, are all correlated with the
ﬂare and CME productivity (e.g., Canﬁeld et al. 1999; Sammis et al. 2000; Falconer et al.
2002, 2006; Leka and Barnes.G 2003; Leka and Barnes 2003; Jing et al. 2006; Ternullo et al.
2006; Schrijver 2007; Georgoulis and Rust 2007; Guo et al. 2007; Wang and Zhang 2008),
and particularly larger ARs are more likely to produce eruptions (e.g., Tian et al. 2002;
Chen et al. 2011). However, not all large ARs have similar productivities in ﬂares and
CMEs, some may be productive in ﬂares only (e.g., Tian et al. 2002; Akiyama et al. 2007;
Chen and Wang 2012). How to distinguish the productivity of an AR is a key issue in space
weather forecasting, and still unsolved so far.

The recent super AR, 12192, crossing the visible solar disk during 2014 October 17 – 30,
caught a wide attention (RHESSI science nugget no.239 ; Sun et al. 2015; Thalmann et al.
2015). It is the largest AR since 1990 November, but produced only one small CME though
a total of 127 C-class and intenser ﬂares, including 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, were
generated. Flares and CMEs are thought to be the consequences of the same eruptive process
(e.g., Harrison 1995; Lin and Forbes 2000). Although the released energy of them during a
strong eruption are on the same order of about 1032 erg (Emslie et al. 2012), they are clearly
diﬀerent. Flares are relatively local phenomena and the released energy is mostly converted
into radiation and energetic particles; while CMEs are more global phenomena and the energy
mostly goes into mechanical energies through ejection of magnetized plasma structures. An
intense ﬂare may not necessarily be accompanied by a CME (e.g., Feynman and Hundhausen
1994; Green et al. 2002b; Yashiro et al. 2005; Wang and Zhang 2007), because whether or
not there is a CME is substantially determined by the driving force of the inner core magnetic
ﬁeld and the conﬁning force of the external overlying ﬁeld (e.g., Wang and Zhang 2007; Liu
2008; Schrijver 2009).

The inner driver is always in a form of highly sheared or twisted magnetic structure,
e.g., a ﬂux rope as required in most CME models (T. Amari, J. F. Luciani, Z. Mikic 1999;
Torok and Kliem 2005). Sheared or twisted ﬁeld carries magnetic helicity, thus provides a
way to transport the helicity naturally (Low 1994; T. Amari, J. F. Luciani, Z. Mikic 1999).
Since magnetic helicity is an invariant in the high conductive corona, it makes a point that a
CME may be an inevitable product with the accumulation of helicity in corona (Low 1994;

– 3 –

Green et al. 2002a; Nindos et al. 2003; Zhang 2006; Zhang et al. 2006; Zhang and Flyer 2008;
Valori et al. 2012; Liu and Schuck 2012).

However, such an AR of continuously generating M and X-class ﬂares without a strong
CME was rarely noticed before, and particularly, 3 out of 6 non-CME X-class ﬂares were of
long-duration (lasting more than one hour), which is quite conﬂicting to many earlier studies
that long-duration ﬂares tend to be easier to erupt out (e.g., Harrison 1995; Yashiro et al.
2006). In order to understand the underlying physical nature, we compare this super AR
with other two pairs of ARs, 11157 and 11158, 11428 and 11429 ﬁrstly, then investigate
the temporal evolution of photospheric parameters, pre-ﬂare distribution of current helicity,
and decay index of the ﬁve ARs in the next two sections. In the last section, we give the
summary and the discussion.

2. Activities of the ARs

AR pairs 11157 and 11158 are chosen for comparison because their productivities are
quite diﬀerent and they transited the visible solar disk almost during the same time, the
same reason for AR 11428 and 11429.

AR 11157 was a very poor AR, no ﬂare or CME was generated during its visible disk
passage. In contrast, AR 11158 produced 68 ﬂares above C1.0 and 12 CMEs, 10 of them
were associated with ﬂares above C1.0. AR 11429, similar to AR 11158, was an proliﬁc
AR, too. It produced 64 ﬂares above C1.0 and 16 CMEs, 10 were ﬂare-accompanied. AR
11428 was chosen as a comparison for 11429, it produced only 5 C-class ﬂares without any
CME. It is noteworthy that AR 11429 and its neighbour AR 11430 were clustered, they
had closely magnetic connection with each other, and some weaker ﬂares simultaneously
occurred in AR 11430 when AR 11429 generated ﬂares, the SHARP (Space weather HMI
Active Region Patches, cutout maps of vector magnetograms that contain single AR (or
cluster of ARs ) (Bobra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2014) ) data also contains the two ARs.
So we simply treat them as an AR complex here. Information of the ARs are showed in
Table 1. The associations of ﬂares, CMEs and ARs are checked manually by using GOES
1.0–8.0 ˚A soft X-ray ﬂux data and the imaging data from SOHO/LASCO (Brueckner et al
1995), STEREO/COR (Kaiser et al. 2008) and SDO/AIA (Lemen et al. 2012).

For clarity, Fig. 1 shows the GOES soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux during these ARs’ transits. AR
11157 and 11158 share the same light curve of the GOES SXR, same for AR 11428 and 11429.
To distinguish the eruptions from the ARs, we use diﬀerent colors for diﬀerent ARs. In the
ﬁgure, all the associated ﬂares are indicated by colored lines and the associated CMEs are

– 4 –

marked by arrows. All the ﬂares above M1.0 and the CMEs have been listed in Table 2. The
parameters of the ﬂares are got from the SolarMonitor1, which is generated based on NOAA
active region summaries, and the parameters of the CMEs are from the SOHO/LASCO CME
Catalog2 (Yashiro 2004) and the SECCHI/COR2 CME Catalog3 (Olmedo et al. 2008).

3. Temporal evolution of the photospheric parameters

Considering that an eruption, i.e., a ﬂare or a CME, only lasts for a relatively short du-
ration and an AR is not always active, we suggest that the overall features of the parameters
during a noticeable duration may be more appropriate than instant values to characterize
an AR’s total productivity, though instant values are more valuable for the prediction of
single event. Based on this idea, we carefully check the temporal evolution of all the SHARP
parameters based on photospheric vector magnetograms (Bobra et al. 2014). The duration
as indicated by the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 1, during which the central meridian distance
(CMD) of the AR’s geometric center is within ±45◦, is chosen to avoid the low signal-to-noise
of the data near the solar limb.

We ﬁrst ﬁnd that the three parameters, the total magnetic ﬂux (Φ), total unsigned
vertical current (Itotal), proxy of photospheric free magnetic energy (ρtot) may be useful to
distinguish ARs of diﬀerent ﬂare productivities. Since the evolutionary trends of them are
similar, only ρtot is showed in Fig. 2(a). The formal random error from the determination of
vector ﬁeld are overplotted as error bars, which are smaller compared to the values of the
parameters themselves. Detailed formulas of the parameters are listed in Table 3.

It is obvious that the two ﬂare-rich ARs, 11429 and 12192 have larger ρtot than the
two inert ARs during their entire durations. The value of ρtot of the other proliﬁc AR,
11158, is small until it reached the central meridian since it’s a newly emerged AR. There
was no intense ﬂare from the AR until ρtot became large, as showed by the purple hollow
arrows in Fig. 2(a). The mean values of Φ, Itotal and ρtot of AR 11158, 11429, 12192 during
the duration, as showed in Table 1, are also larger than the two inert ones’. The results
are consistent with the well-known picture that total ﬂux is a physical measure of the size
of an AR, reﬂecting the total magnetic energy contained in the AR; the electric current
describes the deviation of the magnetic ﬁeld from potential conﬁguration, referring to the

accumulation of free energy. The rapid dissipation of current could be manifested by ﬂares,
thus the strong current system seems to be a favorable condition for ﬂares.

It is hard to tell which parameter is more critical. As achieved by many previous
studies, the combination of the three parameters is responsible for the ﬂare productiv-
ity (Leka and Barnes 2007).
In fact, such a combination of the sharp parameters have
been used for ﬂare prediction: through employing a machine-learning algorithm, a set of
quantities that mostly describe the magnetic energy and vertical current, could achieve a
relatively high ability to distinguish ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs (Bobra and Couvidat 2015).

We also ﬁnd another parameter, mean current helicity (Hc), being well consistent with
the CME productivity, as showed in Fig. 2 (b). Though AR 12192 is the largest AR, its mean
current helicity (Hc) is comparable to the two inert ARs’, smaller than the two both-rich
ARs’.

Quantities describing current helicity are sometimes used as photospheric proxies of mag-
netic helicity (e.g., N.seehafer 1990; Abramenko et al. 1996; Bao and Zhang 1998; Zhang and Bao
1998; Zhang et al. 2000; Wang and Zhang 2015). Magnetic helicity, deﬁned as Hm = R A ·
Bdx3, reﬂecting the twist, shear,
linking or other non-potential properties of magnetic
ﬁeld, is approximately conserved in nearly-ideal MHD circumstance, e.g., the atmosphere
of the sun (Berger and Field 1984; Low and Berger 2003; Brown et al. 1999; Pevtsov et al.
1995; D´emoulin 2007; Pevtsov et al. 2014). Excess Hm injected into the corona could be
reorganized by locally resistant activities, ﬁnally erupt out in the form of highly sheared
or twisted core ﬁeld (e.g., ﬂux ropes) contained in CMEs.
It is pointed that ARs with
eruptive ﬂares contain more coronal magnetic helicity than the ones with conﬁned ﬂares
(M.D.Andrews and A.Nindos 2004; Tziotziou et al. 2012). In the nearly force-free state, the
currents are almost parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld lines, the helicity of current therefore could
be a proxy of magnetic helicity.

However, the mean current helicity (Hc) that we used above is a signed average. Large
value of Hc does indicate the presence of highly sheared or twisted ﬁeld in one handedness,
but small value of Hc could be the result of either absence of highly sheared or twisted ﬁeld,
or the oﬀset between two highly sheared or twisted ﬁelds with opposite handedness. Thus an
additional parameter, total unsigned current helicity Hctotal, is checked to ﬁnd the reason of
small Hc of the three CME-poor ARs . As showed in Fig. 2 (c), AR 11157, 11428 have small
Hctotal, but AR 12192 has quite large Hctotal, which means that there may be some sheared
or twisted ﬁelds in AR 12192, too. Pre-existing, highly sheared or twisted core ﬁeld could
serve as a seed structure for a CME, so why is AR 12192 still CME-poor? The position and
the maturity of the core ﬁeld and the conﬁnement above the AR may be responsible. To
further check this speculation, we investigate the spatial distribution of current helicity on

the photosphere and decay index of the magnetic ﬁeld above the ARs in the next section.

4. Pre-ﬂare conditions

4.1. Spatial Distribution of Current Helicity

We inspect the spatial distribution of current helicity hc on the photosphere of the ARs
at speciﬁc moments: central meridian transits for the two inert ARs, 11157 and 11428; the
moments right before the onsets of the largest ﬂares of the three productive ARs: the X2.2
(2011-02-15T01:44) ﬂare for 11158, the X5.4 (2012-03-07T00:02) ﬂare for 11429, and the
X3.1 (2014-10-24T21:07) ﬂare for 12192. The former two ﬂares are eruptive, and the last
one is conﬁned.

Fig. 3 shows the vector magnetic ﬁeld at the speciﬁc moments of the ﬁve ARs, Br com-
ponent is plotted as background in a dynamic range of ±1000 Gausses, white (black) patches
for the positive (negative) Br. Orange (blue) arrows show the horizontal ﬁeld component,
that originate from positive (negative) Br region. The panels are plotted in unit of Mm
with the same scale, allowing direct comparison of the size of the ARs. Clealy AR 12192 is
the largest one, having strong magnetic ﬁeld as the other two productive ARs. It should be
noted that there are some “bad pixels” with abnormal weak Br in the center of the neagtive
polarity of AR 12192, may be a result of failed inversion. We set thresholds on both the val-
ues of formal errors and the relative errors to the vector magnetic ﬁeld, ﬁnd out those pixels
and smooth them with ambient pixels. Current helicity is calculated after the smooth. In
each pixel, it is calculated by the formula hc = Bz · (▽ × B)z = µ0BzJz, in which the vertical
current density Jz is weighted by Bz, the vertical component of magnetic ﬁeld, which makes
hc more sensitive to the twist or shear of vertical ﬁeld under the force-free assumption.

Colored patches in Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the current helicity, red for the
regions of hc > 0.3 G2m−1 and green for hc 6 −0.3 G2m−1, the threshold of ±0.3 G2m−1
is about two times of standard deviation from mean value of hc map of AR 12192, which
could ﬁnd regions of extremely large hc. The background are images of AIA/1600˚A near
the ﬂares’ peak, showing the positions of the ﬂare ribbons. Br component of the ﬁeld is
contoured on the images, orange contours for positive Br of 200, 1000 gausses , blue contours
for negative Br of −200, −1000 gausses.

The black dotted lines indicate the neutral lines where the ﬂares originated if any. One
may expect the ﬂare of AR 12192 mainly associated with the positive polarity within the
major negative-polarity concentration, but the ﬂare did light along the neutral line indicated
by the black dotted line, as showed by the ﬂare ribbons in Fig. 4(e), that is also conﬁrmed

– 7 –

in Thalmann’s work (Thalmann et al. 2015). It is clear that in each of the two ARs with
eruptive ﬂares, AR 11158 and 11429, there is strong, concentrated current helicity along
both sides of the neutral lines associated with the ﬂare ribbons; while almost no strong
current helicity exists in the two inert ARs, 11157 and 11428. In the AR with conﬁned ﬂare,
AR 12192, strong, concentrated current helicity exists predominantly in the biggest negative
polarity spot, far from the ﬂaring neutral line.

The concentrated patches of strong current helicity along the ﬂaring neutral line may
indicate the photospheric footprints of the highly sheared or twisted core ﬁeld that may serve
as the seed of a CME. We think that for a mature core ﬁeld, its ﬁeld lines should come out
from a strong hc region of the positive polarity, and go into a strong hc region of the negative
polarity, which means that there should be strong hc regions in both positive and negative
polarities on the photosphere. Then one may expect the magnetic ﬂux in the positive and
negative polarity patches with strong hc being roughly balanced. Thus we propose a ratio
(Rφ) between the magnetic ﬂux contributed by the strong hc regions in both polarities to
test this speculation. The current helicity and magnetic ﬂux in the strong hc region of the
three productive ARs are listed in Table. 4. For all pixels where |hc| > 0.3 G2m−1, Rφ of
AR 11158, 11429 are not larger than 1.6, indicating a rough balance between the positive
and negative magnetic ﬂux in those regions; while Rφ of AR 12192 is 2.58, indicating a
stronger ﬂux imbalance. Furtherly, an AR usually has a dominant current helicity sign, as
indicated by Hc in Fig. 2 and Table. 1, positive for AR 11158, negative for AR 11429 and
AR 12192. It may refer to a dominant handedness of twist or shear in an AR. Thus we
introduce another ratio, Rφ
d , similar to Rφ but only for the pixels where |hc| greater than the
threshold in the dominant sign. It is found that Rφ
d of AR 12192 is 4.67, much larger than
the value of AR 11158 and AR 11429, showing a stronger ﬂux imbalance of strong hc regions
in both polarities. These results suggest that there might be no mature sheared or twisted
core ﬁeld in AR 12192, and the large value of Hctotal shown in Fig. 2c could be a result of
the large area of the AR. For the two inert ARs, 11157 and 11428, there are no such seed
structures, too, as exhibited by the hc distribution. The current helicity explored here can
be easily derived from the measurements of the photosphere magnetic ﬁeld, and could be a
useful parameter for the space weather forecasting.

4.2. Decay Index

Further, the pre-existing core ﬁeld may be constrained by the external ﬁeld. We check
the decay index of the ARs in this section to discover the constraint above the ARs. Decay
index is deﬁned by n = − d ln Bex(h)
, in which h is the height from the solar surface, Bex is the

d ln h

– 8 –

external ﬁeld above the AR. The coronal magnetic ﬁeld here is potential ﬁeld extrapolated
from SDO/HMI synoptic chart by using the potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS) model
(Schatten et al. 1969; Wang and Sheeley Jr 1992). A larger decay index means that the
constraint in the corona decrease faster with increasing height, and therefore a perturbation
in the lower corona may cause the CME seed to erupt out more easily (Torok and Kliem
2005; Wang and Zhang 2007; Liu 2008). Critical value above which an eruption is more
likely to occur is 1.5 (T¨or¨ok and Kliem 2007; Aulanier et al. 2010).

Fig. 5 shows the spatial distribution of decay index along the ﬂaring neutral lines, the
black lines mark the critical heights where n reaches 1.5. Clearly, the heights of AR 11158
and 11429 where n reach 1.5 are lower than AR 12192, which means the constraining ﬁeld
above the two ARs with eruptive ﬂares decays rapidly than the one with conﬁned ﬂare,
making a CME more easily. The two inert ARs, 11157 and 11428 also have relatively low
critical heights, but they have no appreciable seed structures as pointed out before. Thus
there was no CME even though the external ﬁeld decayed rapidly.

5. Concluding Remarks

In this work, through comparing AR 12192 with other four ARs, we ﬁnd that three
parameters: the total magnetic ﬂux (Φ), total unsigned vertical current (Itotal), proxy of
photospheric free magnetic energy (ρtot), could be responsible for the ﬂare productivity of
our sample ARs. The ﬂare-rich only AR 12192, same as the other two ﬂare-rich ARs, 11158
and 11429, has larger Φ, Itotal and ρtot, which means that they have larger size, and contain
stronger current system and more free magnetic energy than the two inert ARs 11157 and
11428. It is reasonable since suﬃcient amount of free magnetic energy is a necessary condition
for an AR to power ﬂares.

No single threshold on any parameter could be used to distinguish the ﬂare and CME
productivity of the ARs, but the combination of the mean current helicity and the total
unsigned current helicity can be used to distinguish the ﬂare and CME productivity. The
magnitude of the mean current helicity (|Hc|) is large for the CME-rich ARs, and small
for AR 12192 and the other two CME-poor ARs, while the total unsigned current helicity
(Hctotal) of AR 12192 is as large as the two CME-rich ARs, indicating the presence of sheared
or twisted ﬁeld in all three ﬂare-productive ARs. Considering the spatial distribution of
current helicity, AR 12192 has hc concentrated in only one polarity, suggesting the absence
of a mature seed structure for CME formation during ﬂares. The CME-rich ARs can also be
distinguished by the constraint of the overlying arcade ﬁeld: AR 12192 has a smaller decay
index than the CME-rich ARs, thus no strong CME accompanied the many intense ﬂares it

– 9 –

produced.

Our study here suggests that pre-existing seed structures at ﬂaring position might be a
necessary condition for CMEs. Besides, a large decay index above the AR’s ﬂaring neutral
lines, which indicates a weak constraint, may be another necessary condition for CMEs. All
these facts explain the unusual behaviour of the AR 12192: super ﬂare-rich but CME-poor.
The conclusion is obtained based on a sample of ﬁve ARs, it’s generality should be checked
within a larger sample, which would be performed in the future.
