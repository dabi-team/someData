A New Magnetic Parameter of Active Regions Distinguishing
Large Eruptive and Conﬁned Solar Flares

Ting Li1,2, Xudong Sun3, Yijun Hou1,2, Anqin Chen4, Shuhong Yang1,2 & Jun Zhang5

ABSTRACT

With the aim of investigating how the magnetic ﬁeld in solar active regions
(ARs) controls ﬂare activity, i.e., whether a conﬁned or eruptive ﬂare occurs, we
analyze 106 ﬂares of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
class ≥M1.0 during 2010−2019. We calculate mean characteristic twist parame-
ters αF P IL within the “ﬂaring polarity inversion line” region and αHFED within
the area of high photospheric magnetic free energy density, which both provide
measures of the nonpotentiality of AR core region. Magnetic twist is thought to
be related to the driving force of electric current-driven instabilities, such as the
helical kink instability. We also calculate total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR) of
ARs producing the ﬂare, which describes the strength of the background ﬁeld
conﬁnement. By considering both the constraining eﬀect of background mag-
netic ﬁelds and the magnetic non-potentiality of ARs, we propose a new param-
eter α/ΦAR to measure the probability for a large ﬂare to be associated with
a coronal mass ejection (CME). We ﬁnd that in about 90% of eruptive ﬂares,
αFPIL/ΦAR and αHFED/ΦAR are beyond critical values (2.2×10−24 and 3.2×10−24
Mm−1 Mx−1), whereas they are less than critical values in ∼ 80% of conﬁned
ﬂares. This indicates that the new parameter α/ΦAR is well able to distinguish
eruptive ﬂares from conﬁned ﬂares. Our investigation suggests that the relative
measure of magnetic nonpotentiality within the AR core over the restriction of
the background ﬁeld largely controls the capability of ARs to produce eruptive
ﬂares.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the rapid release of a huge amount of
magnetic energy accumulated in the solar corona through magnetohydrodynamic instabilities
and magnetic reconnection. Solar ﬂares are often, but not always, accompanied by CMEs.
We refer to ﬂares with a CME as “eruptive ﬂares” and ﬂares not associated with a CME
as “conﬁned ﬂares”. It is revealed that ﬂare-CME association rate increases with the ﬂare
intensity (Andrews 2003; Yashiro et al. 2006). Recently, Li et al.
(2020, 2021) found
that ﬂare-CME association rate decreases with total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR) of active
regions (ARs) producing the ﬂare, which provides a global parameter relating to the strength
of the background ﬁeld conﬁnement.

Over the last two decades, signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding the
physical factors determining whether a ﬂare event is associated with a CME or not. It is
suggested that eruptive ﬂares tend to occur if the overlying background magnetic ﬁelds are
weaker or more quickly decay with height (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005; Wang & Zhang 2007; Wang
et al. 2017; Baumgartner et al. 2018; Amari et al. 2018; Jing et al. 2018; Duan et al.
2019). Moreover, the magnetic non-potentiality of ARs is thought to be another important
factor governing the eruptive character of solar ﬂares (Nindos & Andrews 2004; Liu et al.
2016; Cui et al. 2018; Vasantharaju et al. 2018; Thalmann et al. 2019; Avallone & Sun
2020; Gupta et al. 2021), such as free magnetic energy, relative helicity, magnetic twists, etc.
Statistical studies have shown that CME productivity is correlated with the twist parameter
α (Falconer et al. 2002, 2006), which characterizes the degree to which the photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds of an AR deviate from a potential ﬁeld (Leka & Skumanich 1999; Yang et
al. 2012). Bobra & Ilonidis (2016) found that the twist parameter α and mean gradient
of the horizontal ﬁeld are two relatively high-performing features in predicting CMEs based
on machine-learning algorithms. However, the measurement of previous known parameters
showed that there are high degrees of overlap between conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares if only
one factor (overlying conﬁnement or magnetic non-potentiality) was considered in selecting
the parameters (Nindos & Andrews 2004; Wang et al. 2017; Vasantharaju et al. 2018).

Sun et al. (2015) suggested that AR eruptivity is related to the relative value of magnetic
nonpotentiality over the restriction of the background ﬁeld. In this Letter, following the idea
of Sun et al. (2015), we consider both the constraining eﬀect of background magnetic ﬁelds
and the magnetic non-potentiality of ARs, and propose a new parameter α/ΦAR to describe

– 3 –

the eruptive character of a ﬂare. By measuring the parameter of 106 large ﬂares within the
cores of 12 CME-active and 9 CME-quiet ARs, we ﬁnd that the new parameter α/ΦAR is
well able to distinguish ﬂares associated with CMEs from ﬂares that are not.

2. Database Selection and Parameter Calculations

We use a subset of 106 ﬂare events1 ≥M1.0 (43 eruptive and 63 conﬁned) from a large
database of 322 M-class ﬂares2 during the period of June 2010 to June 2019 (Li et al. 2020).
The subset is selected based on the characteristics of ARs, and the selected ARs must fulﬁll
the following two selection criteria. First, the ARs are ﬂare-active and produced ≥3 M-class
ﬂares. Second, the ARs can be unambiguously classiﬁed into CME-active and CME-quiet.
We refer to an AR as a CME-active (CME-quiet) AR if the ﬂares from it are all eruptive
(conﬁned) or only one exceptional ﬂare is conﬁned (eruptive). Finally, a total of 21 ARs
fulﬁll these selection criteria, including 12 CME-active ARs and 9 CME-quiet ARs.

For each event, based on the vector magnetograms from Space-Weather Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) AR Patches (SHARP; Bobra et al. 2014)
observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), we calculate ΦAR before
the ﬂare onset by summing all pixels where vertical magnetic ﬁeld |Bz|>100 G (Kazachenko
et al. 2017). The magnetograms are re-mapped using a cylindrical equal area (CEA) pro-
jection with a pixel size of ∼0′′.5 and presented as (Br, Bθ, Bφ) in heliocentric spherical
coordinates corresponding to (Bz, -By, Bx) in heliographic coordinates (Sun 2013). We have
identiﬁed a “ﬂaring polarity inversion line” (FPIL) mask to demarcate the core of an AR
by using the method of Sun et al. (2015). We ﬁrst ﬁnd the polarity inversion line (PIL)
pixels from a smoothed vertical magnetic ﬁeld Bz, and dilate them with a circular kernel
with a radius of 18 pixels (about 6.5 Mm; other radii are also used and the results are not
aﬀected). Then we isolate ﬂare ribbons by using the 1600 ˚A image near the ﬂare peak from
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the SDO (above 700
DN s−1 which is about 10 times the standard deviation above the mean of the quiet-Sun
values), and dilate them with a large kernel having a radius of 20 pixels (about 7.2 Mm).
Finally the intersection of dilated PIL and ribbon areas is considered as the FPIL mask.
The FPIL mask is similar to the strong-ﬁeld, high-gradient PIL mask in Schrijver (2007),
however, it only involves part of the PIL mask.

We calculate distributions of vertical electric current density Jz and the mean charac-
teristic twist parameter αFPIL within the FPIL mask region. We note that the FPIL mask
region could be determined only after the ﬂare occurrence and thus αFPIL can not be used
for CME forecasting. The energy release during a ﬂare is generally believed to originate from
areas with high values of photospheric magnetic free energy density ρfree in ARs, and thus
we select the region with ρfree>4.0×104 erg cm−3 (HFED region; Chen & Wang 2012) as a
proxy for AR core region and calculate mean characteristic twist parameter αHFED and mean
shear angle ΨHFED within HFED region. Compared with αFPIL, αHFED does not need ribbon
information and is more suitable for CME forecasting. Detailed formulas of the parameters
are listed in Table 1.

3. Statistical Results

Figure 1 shows four examples of two eruptive and two conﬁned ﬂares, which includes
1600 ˚A images (left), photospheric magnetograms (middle) and derived vertical electric cur-
rent density Jz maps (right). We can see that for two eruptive ﬂares (X2.1 ﬂare in AR 11283
and M6.5 in AR 12371) the positive and negative currents have a coherent structure around
the PIL (Figures 1(a)-(b)), indicating the presence of “current ribbons” as in a coherent ﬂux
rope. However, the two conﬁned events (X3.1 in AR 12192 and M6.1 in AR 12222) exhibit
disordered current distributions and do not have any noticeable structure (Figures 1(c)-(d)).
It also can been seen that the FPIL mask regions (orange and black contours) overlap the
area of large currents, implying that the FPIL mask corresponds to the AR core with the
strongest magnetic non-potentiality. We estimate the errors of Jz to be about 10 mA m−2
based on the noise level of transverse magnetic ﬁeld (∼ 100 G in Liu et al. 2012).

Based on the derived Jz map, we then calculated the mean characteristic twist parameter
αFPIL within the FPIL mask region for the 106 ﬂares. Figure 2(a) shows the scatter plot
of αFPIL versus ΦAR. Blue (red) circles are the eruptive (conﬁned) ﬂares. It needs to be
noted that αFPIL is a signed parameter and in our study αFPIL means its absolute value.
It can be seen that the events with αFPIL<0.07 Mm−1 (black dotted line in Figure 2(a))
and ΦAR>1.0×1023 Mx (right green dashed line in Figure 2(a)) are all conﬁned and those
with αFPIL≥0.07 Mm−1 and ΦAR<3.5×1022 Mx (left green dashed line in Figure 2(a)) are
all eruptive. According to error propagation theory, we estimate the errors of αFPIL to be
10−4−10−3 Mm−1 (by considering the error of Jz ∼ 10 mA m−2). The errors are small
and they do not aﬀect our results. The noise level of Bz is on the order of 10 G (Liu et
al. 2012), and the errors in the calculation of ΦAR are estimated to be about 1018−1019
Mx. The errors are much smaller than ΦAR and thus are not considered. Figure 2(b)

– 5 –

shows the scatter plot of ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux versus αFPIL/ΦAR. About 93% (40 of 43) of
eruptive events have αFPIL/ΦAR≥2.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1, and ∼ 83% (52 of 63) of conﬁned
ﬂares have αFPIL/ΦAR<2.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1 (black dash-dotted line in Figure 2(b)). This
shows that the new relative non-potential parameter αFPIL/ΦAR is well able to distinguish
the two populations of eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares. The statistical comparison between the
two distributions in Figure 2(b) was done with a two-sample t-test, which shows a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence (P<0.001). However, there is still a small overlap (14 of 106) by using our criterion
and the exceptional events are mainly from a CME-active AR 11302 and two CME-quiet
ARs 11476 and 12268.

Figure 3 shows the maps of photospheric magnetic free energy density ρfree and magnetic
shear angle Ψ for the four examples shown in Figure 1. Free magnetic energy is the amount
of magnetic energy in excess of the minimum energy attributed to the potential ﬁeld, and
magnetic shear is deﬁned as the angle between the horizontal components of the observed
magnetic ﬁeld and a modeled potential magnetic ﬁeld based on photospheric Bz map. They
are commonly used parameters in describing the magnetic complexity and non-potentiality
(Wang et al. 1994; Su et al. 2014). It can be seen that the maps of ρfree and Ψ exhibit
similar distributions, with their large values around the PILs of ARs. The comparison of
two eruptive ﬂares (Figures 3(a)-(b)) with two conﬁned ones (Figures 3(c)-(d)) shows that
the mean values of ρfree and Ψ of eruptive ﬂares are larger than those of conﬁned events.
Similar to the appearance of Jz maps (Figure 1), ρfree and Ψ of eruptive ﬂares exhibit ribbon
patterns, however, the ρf ree and Ψ maps of conﬁned ﬂares show disordered distributions.

We determine high-ρfree areas (HFED region) as a proxy for AR core region and then
calculate mean characteristic twist parameter αHFED and mean shear angle ΨHFED within the
HFED region. Figure 4 shows the calculation results for 43 eruptive and 63 conﬁned ﬂares.
It can be seen that the distributions of αHFED (Figure 4(a)) are similar to those of αFPIL
(Figure 2(a)). For αHFED<0.1 Mm−1 (black dotted line in Figure 4(a)), an overwhelming
majority (about 93%, 26 out of 28) of ﬂares are conﬁned. Almost all the eruptive ﬂares
(41 out of 43) have αHFED≥0.1 Mm−1. If we consider the relative parameter αHFED/ΦAR,
the diﬀerences between conﬁned and eruptive cases are more evident (Figure 4(b)). About
91% (39 of 43) of eruptive ﬂares have αHFED/ΦAR≥3.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1, and ∼ 75% (47
of 63) of conﬁned events have αHFED/ΦAR<3.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1 (black dash-dotted line
in Figure 4(b)). There is also a diﬀerence of mean shear angle ΨHFED within HFED region
between eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares (Figure 4(c)). The proportion of conﬁned ﬂares is ∼91%
(29 of 32) corresponding to ΨHFED<60◦. Similarly, the relative parameter ΨHFED/ΦAR can
provide a good ability for distinguishing the eruptive and conﬁned events (Figure 4(d)). An
overwhelming majority of eruptive ﬂares have ΨHFED/ΦAR≥1.0×10−21 degree Mx−1 and most
of conﬁned ﬂares show ΨHFED/ΦAR<1.0×10−21 degree Mx−1. The degree of overlap between

– 6 –

eruptive and conﬁned events for ΨHFED/ΦAR is a little higher than that for αHFED/ΦAR.
The two-sample t-test was carried out for the two parameters in Figures 4(b) and (d), and
showed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence (P<0.001).

4. Summary and Discussion

In this study, we have analyzed the magnetic non-potentiality of ARs and the con-
straining eﬀect of background ﬁelds for 106 ﬂares ≥M1.0-class from 12 CME-active and 9
CME-quiet ARs. We proposed a new parameter αFPIL/ΦAR that is well able to distinguish
ARs with the capability of producing eruptive ﬂares. About 93% of eruptive events have
the distributions of αFPIL/ΦAR≥2.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1, and ∼ 83% of conﬁned ﬂares have
αFPIL/ΦAR<2.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1. Moreover, we select the areas of high photospheric
magnetic free energy density before the ﬂare onset as a proxy for AR core region to calculate
mean characteristic twist parameter αHFED and mean shear angle ΨHFED. The statistical
results showed that the relative parameters αHFED/ΦAR and ΨHFED/ΦAR can also provide a
good ability for distinguishing the eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares. Overall, about 81% (86 out
of 106) of ﬂare events can be classiﬁed into the two populations of conﬁned and eruptive
ﬂares using the parameter αHFED/ΦAR (through determining a critical value). The perfor-
mance of ΨHFED/ΦAR is not as good as that of αHFED/ΦAR, and about 74% (78 out of 106)
of ﬂare events can be distinguished.

Parameter α is the average characteristic twist of the magnetic ﬁeld lines around the
PILs of an AR, and provide measures of the nonpotentiality of AR core region (Leka &
Skumanich 1999; Benson et al. 2021). Previous studies have shown that the parameter
of magnetic twist plays an important role in discriminating between conﬁned and eruptive
events and can be used to predict whether an X- or M-class ﬂaring AR would produce a
CME (Bobra & Ilonidis 2016; Duan et al. 2019). Magnetic twist is thought to be related to
the driving force of electric current-driven instabilities, such as the helical kink instability
(Hood & Priest 1979). An AR containing a highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld tends to produce
an eruption when the twist exceeds a certain threshold. On the other hand, according to
the study of Li et al. (2020), ΦAR has a high positive correlation with the critical decay
index height (related to the torus instability of a magnetic ﬂux rope; Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006),
implying that ΦAR describes the strength of the background ﬁeld conﬁnement. Our statistical
study reveals that the relative parameter α/ΦAR has a better performance in distinguishing
between the two types of ﬂares than only ΦAR or α does. We suggest that the relative
parameter α/ΦAR indicates the balance between the upward force that drives the eruptions
and the downward force that suppresses the eruptions.

– 7 –

Recently, several studies have shown the general trend that conﬁned events have a
smaller reconnection ﬂux fraction (Φribbon/ΦAR; deﬁned by the ratio between the ﬂux swept
by the ﬂare ribbons to the total AR ﬂux) compared with eruptive ﬂares (Toriumi et al. 2017;
Li et al. 2020; Kazachenko et al. 2021). However, there is a considerable overlap between
the ﬂux fraction distributions of conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares. Comparably, our parameters
α/ΦAR and αHFED/ΦAR show more signiﬁcant diﬀerences in distributions between the two
populations of ﬂares. We hypothesize that Φribbon involves part of overlying background
conﬁning ﬁelds of ARs participating the ﬂare reconnection at the late stage of the ﬂare. In
comparison, αFPIL and αHFED only correspond to the pre-ﬂare high-twist ﬁelds in an AR
core region, which are strongly related to the initial driving force of solar ﬂares. Therefore,
αFPIL/ΦAR and αHFED/ΦAR can provide a better ability for distinguishing the eruptive and
conﬁned events than Φribbon/ΦAR.

The idea of the new parameter α/ΦAR can be generalized to “relative non-potentiality”,
which refers to the ratio of magnetic ﬂux (or other physical quantities) in a ﬂux rope to that
in the surrounding magnetic structures (Lin et al. 2021). A larger relative non-potentiality
indicates a higher probability for a ﬂux rope to erupt (Toriumi et al. 2017; Thalmann et al.
2019; Gupta et al. 2021). Recently, Lin et al. (2020) proposed a new relative non-potentiality
parameter of the magnetic ﬂux in the highly twisted region relative to its ambient background
ﬁelds, which demonstrated a moderate ability in discriminating between conﬁned and ejective
events. It seems that our parameters α/ΦAR shows a better classiﬁcation performance than
the parameter proposed in Lin et al. (2020). For instance, two events of X1.6 and X3.1-class
ﬂares in AR 12192 failed to be correctly classiﬁed in Lin et al. (2020, 2021), however, they
can be correctly classiﬁed in our study. However, due to the diﬀerence of selected samples,
a direct comparison can not be carried out.

In recent years, the importance of the conﬁnement of ﬂux ropes by overlying loops (and
thus the importance of structural relativity) has been actively discussed in the theoretical
and modeling studies. Leake et al. (2013) simulated a magnetic ﬂux emergence into pre-
existing dipole coronal ﬁeld and found that it becomes a stable ﬂux rope if the dipole coronal
ﬁeld is orientated to minimize magnetic reconnection. Using the same simulation results,
Pariat et al. (2017) found that the ratio of the magnetic helicity of the current-carrying
magnetic ﬁeld to the total relative helicity diagnoses very clearly the eruptive potential of
their parametric simulations. Toriumi & Takasao (2017) conducted ﬂux emergence models
and showed that the conﬁnement of the ﬂux rope or the access to the outer space depends
on the large-scale AR structures, which determines the CME eruption. The CME eruption
is predicted by the SHARP parameters that characterize the “relativity” between the ﬂaring
zone and overall AR area. Amari et al. (2018) suggested that the role of the magnetic cage
is one deciding factor for the success or failure of CMEs.

– 8 –

Our ﬁndings imply that the relative measure of magnetic nonpotentiality within the AR
core over the restriction of the background ﬁeld largely controls whether a ﬂare is eruptive
or conﬁned. However, it needs to be noted that there is still a small overlap (less than 20%)
between the two populations of conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares by using parameter α/ΦAR. We
suggest that other unknown mechanisms or intrinsic stochasticity may also play a role in
governing CME production.

Fig. 1.— Four examples of two eruptive and two conﬁned ﬂares showing SDO/AIA 1600
˚A images (left), SDO/HMI photospheric magnetograms Bz (middle) and derived vertical
electric current density Jz maps (right). From top to bottom: eruptive X2.1-class ﬂare in
AR 11283, eruptive M6.5-class ﬂare in AR 12371, conﬁned X3.1-class ﬂare in AR 12192
and conﬁned M6.1-class ﬂare in AR 12222. AIA 1600 ˚A images were remapped with CEA
projection. Orange and black contours outline the FPIL mask regions within which the mean
characteristic twist parameter (αFPIL) in Figure 2 was calculated.

Fig. 3.— Maps of photospheric free magnetic energy density ρfree and magnetic shear angle
Ψ of four examples (from top to bottom: eruptive X2.1-class ﬂare in AR 11283, eruptive
M6.5-class ﬂare in AR 12371, conﬁned X3.1-class ﬂare in AR 12192 and conﬁned M6.1-class
ﬂare in AR 12222). The white and green contours are the magnetic ﬁelds Bz at ±800 G
levels. Mean characteristic twist parameter αHFED and mean shear angle ΨHFED in Figure 4
are calculated within the areas of ρfree>4.0×104 erg cm−3.

Fig. 4.— Similar to Figure 2, but for mean characteristic twist parameter αHFED and mean
shear angle ΨHFED within HFED region. Blue (red) circles are eruptive (conﬁned) ﬂares. The
horizontal dotted line in panel (a) corresponds to αHFED of 0.1 Mm−1. The vertical dash-
dotted line in panel (b) refers to αHFED/ΦAR of 3.2×10−24 Mm−1 Mx−1. The horizontal
dotted line in panel (c) denotes ΨHFED of 60◦. The vertical dash-dotted line in panel (d)
corresponds to ΨHFED/ΦAR of 1.0×10−21 degree Mx−1.
