ABSTRACT

Context. Active regions (ARs) are the main sources of variety in solar dynamic events. Automated detection and identiﬁcation tools
need to be developed for solar features for a deeper understanding of the solar cycle. Of particular interest here are the dynamical
properties of the ARs, regardless of their internal structure and sunspot distribution.
Aims. We studied the oscillatory dynamics of two ARs: NOAA 11327 and NOAA 11726 using two diﬀerent methods of pattern
recognition.
Methods. We developed a novel method of automated AR border detection and compared it to an existing method for the proof-
of-concept. The ﬁrst method uses least-squares ﬁtting on the smallest ellipse enclosing the AR, while the second method applies
regression on the convex hull.
Results. After processing the data, we found that the axes and the inclination angle of the ellipse and the convex hull oscillate in
time. These oscillations are interpreted as the second harmonic of the standing long-period kink oscillations (with the node at the
apex) of the magnetic ﬂux tube connecting the two main sunspots of the ARs. We also found that the inclination angles oscillate with
characteristic periods of 4.9 hours in AR 11726 and 4.6 hours in AR 11327. In addition, we discovered that the lengths of the pattern
axes in the ARs oscillate with similar characteristic periods and these oscillations might be ascribed to standing global ﬂute modes.
Conclusions. In both ARs we have estimated the distribution of the phase speed magnitude along the magnetic tubes (along the
two main spots) by interpreting the obtained oscillation of the inclination angle as the standing second harmonic kink mode. After
comparing the obtained results for fast and slow kink modes, we conclude that both of these modes are good candidates to explain the
observed oscillations of the AR inclination angles, as in the high plasma β regime the phase speeds of these modes are comparable and
on the order of the Alfv´en speed. Based on the properties of the observed oscillations, we detected the appropriate depth of the sunspot
patterns, which coincides with estimations made by helioseismic methods. The latter analysis can be used as a basis for developing a
magneto-seismological tool for ARs.

1. Introduction

Active regions (ARs) represent the most complex magnetic
structures emerging on the surface of the Sun. They consist of
many sunspots. Their number, location, and size vary in time,
thus sunspots are indicators or tracers of solar magnetic activity.
The complexity of the ARs manifests itself in their morphol-
ogy and their dynamics. These two features determine the dif-
ferent types of waves and oscillatory motions that abundantly
populate the ARs. The study of these oscillatory phenomena can
formally be divided into the following branches (Chorley et al.,
2010): (i) umbral chromospheric oscillations with a typical pe-
riod of 3 minutes, interpreted as slow magnetoacoustic waves
(e.g., Centeno et al., 2006). Other interpretation models reported
on acoustic wave propagation in the structured (or stratiﬁed)
atmosphere (Fleck & Schmitz, 1991; Kuridze et al., 2009); (ii)
umbral photospheric oscillations with a typical period of 5

minutes and associated with photospheric acoustic oscillations
(Thomas et al., 1984). In this context, there might be an inter-
esting connection between these oscillations and high-degree
p-modes, which themselves are aﬀected by the diﬀerential so-
lar rotation (Shergelashvili & Poedts, 2005); (iii) long-period
oscillations (on the order of hours, e.g., Efremov et al., 2007;
Goldvarg et al., 2005); and (iv) ultra-long-period (torque or tor-
sional) oscillations of sunspot umbrae, with typical periods of
several days (Khutsishvili et al., 1998; Gopasyuk, 2004).

in particular branch (iii) above,

In the present paper, we focus on the long-period os-
cillations in ARs,
is,
those with periods of up to a few hours. Observations of
these oscillatory features in sunspots have been extensively
reported in radio emission measurements by Gelfreikh et al.
(2007); Solov’ev & Kirichek (2008);
(2006); Efremov et al.

Dumbadze et al.: Long-period oscillations of active region patterns

Bakunina et al. (2009). As has been indicated by Bakunina et al.
(2009), while the observed short-period oscillations are identi-
ﬁed as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves that are trapped
inside the magnetic ﬂux tubes of the sunspots, the low-frequency
oscillations are caused by quasi-periodic displacements of the
whole sunspot as a well localized and stable formation.

It is very important to understand the basic physical na-
ture of the long-period phenomena because they can be di-
rectly linked to the excitation of Alfv´en wave ﬁelds in the
solar atmosphere. In turn, these wave ﬁelds may be engaged
in complex conversion and dissipation processes in the so-
lar corona in terms of processes driven by shear ﬂows (see,
e.g., Shergelashvili et al., 2006), thermal variability related to
wave couplings (Shergelashvili et al., 2007), and a variety
of parametric interactions of waves (Zaqarashvili et al., 2002;
Zaqarashvili & Roberts, 2002; Shergelashvili et al., 2005).

Automated detection and identiﬁcation methods for solar
magnetic patterns have been developed recently, among them
those for ARs and sunspots. The method of AR identiﬁca-
tion includes morphological analysis and intensity thresholds
(Barra et al., 2009; Preminger et al., 2001; Zharkov et al., 2003;
Zharkova et al., 2003; Georgoulis et al., 2008; Bobra et al.,
2014). Zhang et al.
(2010) used Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magne-
tograms to detect regions on the solar surface with a line-of-sight
(LOS) component of the magnetic ﬁeld larger than 250 G and
an area more extended than 10 Mm2. McAteer et al. (2005) ex-
plored and automatically detected ARs on full-disk MDI mag-
netograms with a threshold value of 50 G used for identiﬁca-
tion of the AR borders. Hoeksema et al. (2014) developed an
AR trajectory automatic detection tool, called the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) Active Region Patches (HARPs).
It provides primarily spatial information about long-lived co-
herent magnetic structures at the scale of a solar active region.
Martens et al. (2012) produced software modules that detect,
trace, and analyze the emergence and evolution of ARs, mag-
netic elements and other solar features, such as ﬂares, sigmoids,
ﬁlaments, coronal dimmings, polarity inversion lines, sunspots
and other magnetic structures.

Verbeeck et al. (2013) described two algorithms: the solar
monitor active region tracker (SMART), which automatically
extracts, characterizes, and tracks active regions (Higgins et al.,
2011); and the automated solar activity prediction (ASAP),
which represents a set of algorithms that detect sunspots, fac-
ulae, and active regions (Colak & Qahwaji, 2008). Moreover,
Verbeeck et al. (2014) described another method called the spa-
tial possibility clustering algorithm (SPoCA-suite). This method
detects ARs, quite Sun (QS), and coronal holes (CH) on full so-
lar disk images. SPoCA-suite segments an extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) image into ARs, QSs, and CHs so that every pixel corre-
sponds to one of these three classes, based on their pixel values
in the image (Barra et al., 2009).

In this paper, we develop an automated AR border detection
that is adapted to the study of oscillatory motions. After detect-
ing the boundary points, we build the AR boundary shape using
the least-squares ﬁtting to a second-order curve, in particular to
an ellipse. Finally, after the data processing and the detection of
the ellipse parameter temporal dynamics, we study the possible
distribution of the Alfv´en speed value along the magnetic tubes
by interpreting the results as standing kink modes in the thin tube
approximation. In our model we use thresholds on the magnetic
ﬁeld gradient instead of its original value, and validate our new
concept by comparing it with results obtained with the convex
hull method (Stenning et al., 2013).

This paper is organized as follows: the observations are de-
scribed in Sect. 2. The automated AR border detection and least-
squares mapping on the second-order curve of the boundary
points are introduced in Sect. 3. The results are presented in
Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we interpret the discovered AR oscillations.
Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 6.

2. Data and observed ARs

We used data from the SDO/HMI database. This telescope feeds
the full-disk solar image in two 40962-pixel CCD cameras that
record every 3.75 seconds, giving an overall cadence of 45 sec-
onds for the LOS magnetic ﬁeld, Doppler and intensity mea-
surements (Schou et al., 2012; Scherrer et al., 2012). We have
selected two active regions, NOAA 11327 and NOAA 11726,
which have a suﬃciently long lifetime and a topology resem-
bling an elliptical shape. The data set covers the following ob-
servational time windows: for AR 11726 – 20/04/2013 at 00:00
am UT – 22/04/2013 at 3:12 am UT; for AR 11327 – 20/10/2011
at 6:00 pm UT – 22/10/2011 at 9:12 pm UT.

2.1. AR NOAA 11726

This AR appeared in the center of the northern hemisphere on
19/04/2013 at about 6:00 am UT and was hidden behind the
western limb on 26/04/2013 at 11:00 am UT. On 19/04/2013
the AR emerged from the solar interior as a small round group
of sunspots with diﬀerent polarities. The main spots moved in
diﬀerent directions, and new tiny spots appeared between them.
After six hours, another spot with an elongated shape appeared
next to the ﬁrst. On 20/04/2013 at about 2:00 am UT, these two
spots joined and formed a single elliptical shape AR (see Fig. 1
panel 1a). During the whole period of observation, 60 ﬂares were
launched from this AR, including 1 M-, 49 C-, and 10 B-class
ﬂares. A movie showing the evolution of this AR can be found
on the SOLSPANET web site http://www.solspanet.eu in the AR
catalogs.

2.2. AR NOAA 11327

Active region 11327 appeared in the southern hemisphere on
20/10/2011 at about 2:00 am UT and was hidden behind the
western limb on 28/10/2011 at 3:00 am UT. The AR emerged on
the solar surface as a small elongated bipolar sunspot group. Its
main spots were located close to each other and were surrounded
by many smaller spos (see Fig. 1 panel 1b). On 20/10/2011 at
3:00 pm UT, tiny spots ﬁlled out the space between the main
spots and gave an elliptical shape to the AR. On 22/10/2011 at
about 2:00 am UT, the main spots of the AR began to move
in opposite directions, which destroyed the elliptical shape. No
ﬂares were registered in AR 11327 during this period.

3. Description of the pattern recognition method

(data processing)

To study the AR dynamics of interest, we ﬁrst developed a pro-
cedure for the AR boundary recognition that we call the method
of least-squares mapping of an ellipse. This procedure implies
several stages, starting from a proper selection of the pixels be-
longing to the boundary, and followed by the detection of the
boundary shape using a least-squares ﬁtting method (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Snapshots taken on 21/04/2013 at 6:01 am UT for AR
11726 (panels 1a, 2a, 3a, and 4a) and on 21/10/2011 at 12:45 am
UT for AR 11327 (panels 1b, 2b, 3b, and 4b). These panels show
the stages of our pattern recognition method based on the least-
squares mapping of ellipses.

We considered a rectangular domain enclosing the ARs,
which consist of randomly distributed small sunspots and par-
ticular pixels with accidently strong magnetic ﬁeld intensity (see
Fig. 1 panels 1a and b). We identiﬁed boundary points by choos-
ing the ﬁrst pixel with a ﬁeld gradient exceeding the threshold
of 40 Gauss/pixel starting from the top and bottom edges of the
domain (see Fig. 1 panels 2a and b). We thus detect pairs of
y
coordinates of the registered pixels in each vertical slice. To
−
reduce the inﬂuence of random noise on the distribution of these
points, we took the average of the coordinates for 30 consecu-
tive points and set new number of boundary points (see Fig. 1
panels 3a and b). Consequently, we used the found points in the
least-squares ﬁtting model (see Fig. 1 panels 4a and b). The cal-
culation of the ellipse parameters is explained in Appendix A.

Using a sequence of snapshots within the observational time
span, we produced time series for the major and minor semi-axes
and the inclination angle. In general, the axes of both ARs show
a tendency of growing in size, approximately linearly. However,
the time behavior of their lengths also shows some oscillations,
and so does the inclination angle. The amplitude of the lat-
ter varies within the range [0.09; 0.21] (with a mean value of
0.16) radians for AR 11726; and [0.26; 0.40] (with a mean value
of 0.34) radians for AR 11327. We conclude that the tempo-
ral evolution of the inclination angle oscillates, the major and
minor axes grow monotonically, and in addition, the lengths of
both axes also oscillate. Therefore, the obtained ellipses tilt and
breathe (as the ellipse axes also oscillate) all the time in a quasi-
periodic manner. In Fig. 2 we show plots of detrended data by
cubic interpolation time series for the axes (top four panels) and
the original one for the inclination angle (two bottom panels).

For a reference model as a validation or proof-of-concept of
our method, we also employed the convex hull approach to de-
tect the shape of the ARs ﬁrst and then to study the temporal be-
havior of the obtained convex hull axis and its inclination angle
in time. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon contain-
ing the whole pattern and enables a recognition procedure for
the object shape. The boundary points were found by setting a
threshold value, and we built the convex hull using the quickhull
method (Eddy, 1977; Bykat, 1978). The quickhull ﬁrst computes

the top, bottom, left, and right points that create a quadrilateral
including all subject points and then decreases this quadrilateral
till it reaches the boundary points.

Before turning to the detailed description of our results, we
list the main advantages of the novel method compared to, for
instance, the convex hull method:

– Our new method for the registration of potential AR bound-
ary points is based on a threshold for the gradient of the mag-
netic ﬁeld instead of its absolute value. This approach allows
us to ﬁlter out almost all internal pixels and to focus only on
the pixels close to the actual AR boundary.

– The ellipse shape enables the measurement of both the longi-
tudinal and transverse characteristic scales of the AR, while
with the convex hull approach only obtains the former.

– Our comparative analysis also showed that the distribution
of the inclination angle around its mean value is far more
chaotically dispersed with the convex hull method than with
our new approach. Hence, we argue that measurements of
the inclination angle are much more reliable with the ellipse
method.

4. Results

4.1. Ellipseoscillations

To enable a quantitative analysis of the observed oscillations,
we applied fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques to the de-
trended ellipse axes lengths and to the inclination angle data se-
ries. This analysis reveals several signiﬁcant spectral peaks with
a conﬁdence level above 99.98%. The peaks corresponding to
the longest periods have been removed because we interpreted
them as known instrumental artifacts related to the 12- and 24-
hour signal variations in HMI magnetograms (Liu et al., 2012).
The FFT analysis of the detrended data for axes lengths and for
the inclination angle are shown in Fig. 3, the left panels refer to
AR 11726 and right panels to AR 11327.

Before we interpret the observed quasi-harmonic behavior,
we need to explain the resolution of the obtained Fourier spec-
tra that characterize the periodogram resolution. First of all,

where a and b are two from any three obtained peaks. The spec-
tral distance between the periods is on the order of the spec-
tral resolution, while to be able to isolate individual peaks well,
the distance should be at least a few multiples of the resolution.
Therefore, in the current study we do not distinguish between the
three peaks, but operate with their average values. The averaging
of periods allows us to perform a semi-qualitative or quantitative
rough estimation of the periods and related physical parameters
of the ARs (see below). This type of estimation and its precision
suﬃces for the current stage of the investigation. A more pre-
cise analysis of the spectral peak ﬁne structures requires a more
rigorous mathematical approach and is left for future research.

AR 11726 (left panels) and for AR 11327 (right panels), respectively. The vertical axis denotes the length and degree. The horizontal
axis indicates the duration of the observations (in hours).

We calculated the characteristic errors of the obtained pe-
riods using two diﬀerent methods. The ﬁrst method calculates
the half-width of the corresponding power peaks and then takes
their mean values. The second method is based on ﬁnding the
standard deviation of the set of peaks from the above derived
mean. Next, we estimated the errors by calculating the standard
error ∆Perror = σ/ √n where n = 3 (ellipse) or n = 4 (convex
hull) is the number of mean period samples. The resulting mean
values of the periods and their errors are listed in Table 1.

4.2. Convex hulloscillations

In the convex hull approach, we also performed a Fourier anal-
ysis that also showed characteristic periods for the inclination
angle and the greatest length between two nonadjacent points of
the convex hull. The artiﬁcial periods were also removed. After
this, we found several periods with a conﬁdence level higher than
99.98%. The spectral analyses of the detrended convex hull data
for ARs 11726 and 11327 are shown in Fig. 4. All mean periods
and error bars are calculated using the same methods as for the
ellipse. All these values with their error bars are also shown in
Table 1.

5. Analysis of the oscillations

Our aim is to understand the dynamical properties of the ARs
as a system of interlinked sunspots and to examine their long-
period oscillations. Their dynamic behavior consists of three
main components, viz. the creation and evolution of the ARs,
their translational migration over the solar surface, and their os-

cillatory motions. The structure of the oscillatory system con-
sists of two main spots of opposite polarity, both anchored in the
high-density solar interior, and linked to each other with mag-
netic loops in the low-density solar atmosphere. These conﬁgu-
rations are rather complex because of the structured density pro-
ﬁle, and ARs are usually fragmentized in a set of interlinked
sunspots. Strictly speaking, such an oscillatory system can be
modeled as a system of interrelated magnetic loops (Parker,
1979). Therefore, we emphasize here that the notion of the AR
depth used throughout this paper is related exactly to this frag-
mentation of the ﬂux tubes. However, within the scope of the
current study we distinguish the principal components in terms
of the two main large spots, thus mimicking the basic system
in the form of a single loop. According to Parker (1979), the
magnetic ﬂux tube splits into many individual small ones be-
low the solar surface. We assume that at the depth this occurs,
the wave is reﬂected back to the surface. An analytic study of
waves and oscillations might be cumbersome from the mathe-
matical point of view (stiﬀ problems). However, here we pro-
vide a rather simple interpretation, which enables a ﬁrst-order
estimation of the physical parameters of the ARs. From this per-
spective, the method can be further developed in the future as a
full-scale magneto-seismological tool for ARs with a more rigor-
ous analytical background. We also develop the image moment
method, where substructure oscillation spectra will be studied
separately.

The ARs consist of two main spots with opposite polarity
anchored deep inside the Sun and connected by a loop above
the surface. We assume that the long-period oscillations corre-
spond to kink eigenmodes. We consider the characteristic peri-

ods of the time evolution of the inclination angle and of the axes
length oscillations separately. The inclination angle oscillation
is interpreted as the standing second harmonic of the kink-type
mode (in our analysis we examine fast and slow kink modes, and
conclusions are given below), which implies that the oscillation
has a node in the apex of the loop and the AR oscillates as a
whole around the axis passing through this node. Our goal is to

examine this hypothesis by calculating the characteristic mean
propagation speeds (which should be realistic) and, by checking
the maximal depth of the oscillation pattern, to provide an esti-
mate of size of the sub-surface (convection zone) part of the AR.
The phase speed of the oscillation mode must be much higher at
the solar surface than that at the sub-surface foot points. This de-
scription does not rule out a magnetic connection of the sunspots

to the base of the convection zone, it merely outlines possible
properties of the standing oscillations of ARs. From our anal-
ysis we try use the properties of the oscillations to deduce the
appropriate depth of the AR anchoring and to which types of
mode, fast or slow, the observed oscillations correspond. Using
the Fourier periodograms from the analysis above and after ex-
cluding the artiﬁcial periods, we calculated the characteristic av-
erage inclination angle and axes length oscillation periods with
a certain error bar (we discussed the methods used for the error
estimation above) for both ARs. The obtained values were 4.9
hours and 4.7 hours for AR 11726, and 4.6 hours and 4.6 hours
for AR 11327.

To understand the physical properties of the observed oscil-
lations, we need to take the structured environment into account.
In addition to the cylindrical geometry that is usually addressed
in this case, following Roberts (2000) and Edwin & Roberts
(1983), we have to take into account that the density proﬁle along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines is rather complex: above the solar sur-
face magnetic loops connect the sunspots, and these loops are
embedded in a low-density plasma (with low β plasma); there is
an abrupt density transition at the solar surface, and the density
gradually increases with depth (the sub-surface region has high
plasma β). The development of an MHD formalism for such a
complex setup is a rather challenging task, requiring the deriva-
tion and solution of multilayer dispersion equations of complex,
transcendental type (Zaqarashvili & Murawski, 2007). This is
far beyond the scope of this study. As noted by Roberts (2000)
and Edwin & Roberts (1983), under the photospheric conditions
where VA0 > Cse > Ck > Cs0 > VAe (with VA and Cs the Alfv´en
and sound speed at the solar surface (index 0) and in the external
medium (index 0)), the kink speed Ck is sub-Alfv´enic and super-
sonic (Ck > Cs0 > VAe), while the tube speed CT (deﬁned be-
low in Eq. 4) is clearly subsonic. However, this conﬁguration is
only appropriate for the surface layer. Because the plasma den-
sity increases drastically with depth, the above inequalities are
not valid below the surface of the Sun. Furthermore, unless we
develop a rigorous theory of such waves (as mentioned above),
we have to consider mean values of the quantities following the
deﬁnition of the average value as

f =

h
0 f dr
h

,

R

(2)

where 0 indicates the solar surface and h a certain height or
depth. For pragmatic reasons, we neglected the height of the
loops above the surface, that is, in the low beta plasma medium,
and we assumed that the oscillation of the ARs is predominantly
determined by the oscillation of the foot points. In addition, we
assumed that the foot points of the sunspots are anchored (ﬁxed)
at a certain depth in the convection zone where the modes are
reﬂected, thus enabling a standing wave pattern in the system.

6

There are several possible causes for such reﬂections. For in-
stance, as the density of the plasma gradually increases with in-
creasing depth, the plasma contained in the tube gains more and
more inertia and thus the displacement of the tube axis (in case
of a kink mode) at some depth becomes signiﬁcantly smaller
than its surface value. Thus, even though the magnetic tube it-
self may still be directly connected to the dynamo generated
toroidal ﬁeld at the tachocline, the depth of the turning point
may not coincide with the total depth of the convection zone.
The situation is similar when the reﬂection of the wave at some
depth is due to the structural fragmentation of the ﬂux tube be-
low a certain depth (as is predicted by some sunspot models).
In this case, wave propagation occurs only till the depth where
the fragmentation starts, and below this depth the morphology of
one uniﬁed waveguide might split into many smaller branches.
In either of these cases, one condition should be satisﬁed: the
actual phase speed of the selected mode (harmonic) must be re-
alistic. We address this quantitative aspect of the problem be-
low. We describe such depths as a kind of turning depths of the
modes, which determine the shape of the eigenfunctions related
to the modes along the depth and spatio-temporal properties of
the modes (wave number, period, etc.). In this description, we as-
sumed that the average values of the characteristic speeds of the
medium satisfy the relations C se > C s0 > Ck > V A0 and VAe = 0.
Under these circumstances, the kink speed is determined by the
relation of the densities inside and outside of the sunspot and the
Alfv´en speed inside it. So the kink speed reads as

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

It should be also noticed that under the considered regimes,
both the kink and tube speed are on the order of the Alfv´en
speed. From this moment, without going into detail of the equi-
librium state or of perturbation properties of that equilibrium, we
consider the average values of these quantities and build our dis-
cussion based on two assumptions, viz. the turning point (depth
of ﬁxation of the sunspot foot point) is situated at the place where
the phase speed of the considered oscillation becomes dismiss-
ingly small compared to its surface value (in case of 10 000 km
it reaches 0.01, for 20 000 km 0.09 and for 40 000 km 0.3 of the
amplitude surface value); and the phase speed is distributed over
the depth as an exponential function:

where P is the observed period of the oscillations. Next, we cal-
culated the average phase velocity from the solar surface to the
footpoints of the system. We concentrated on the kink modes
to estimate the mean Alfv´en speed and its distribution over the
depth along the sunspots in both ARs. For slow kink modes, we
assumed that the temperature inside the tube is T0 = 3/5Te. To
evaluate the sound speed at the solar surface inside the sunspot,
we used the photospheric value of the temperature outside the
spot, Te = 5700 K.

errors obtained from method 2 are shown in brackets in Table 3.
Figures 5 and 6 show that the obtained depth values are in
the range 10 000 km to 200 000 km. The latter depth value
corresponds to the thickness of the convection zone, while the
other values are justiﬁed by direct helioseismic measurements
of the sunspot depth (Gizon et al., 2009). Expression (5) is ob-
tained by taking into account the fact that in the convective zone
the plasma density increases gradually with depth and, conse-
quently, the phase speeds of both modes considered should be
vanishing at the turning point (compared to its value on the so-
lar surface). Obviously, the values of the mean velocities corre-
sponding to the depth of the convection zone h = 200 000 km
(dotted curves in the ﬁgures) are inconsistent with this assump-
tion, while the depth of the turning points in the ﬁgures con-
verged at about 40 000 km. The analysis we carried out has
the potential of becoming a seismological tool for determining
the actual depths where ARs are anchored. This tool, however,
needs to be further developed in the near future with enhanced
mathematical rigor.

There are several arguments to consider when explaining the
oscillations of the major or minor axes lengths: (i) The funda-
mental harmonic of the sausage mode seems intuitively to be
the best candidate. However, this is problematic because as is
known, these types of modes are leaky unless the ﬂux tube is
suﬃciently thick and dense so that the plasma density inside the
loop is much higher than outside. The oscillatory system con-
sidered here does not satisfy this condition. Moreover, even if
it were possible, the characteristic period of the mode has to be
twice the period of the kink oscillation, while we found that the
characteristic periods of all parameters of the ellipse are sim-
ilar. In principle, the global sausage mode can be excited, but
we cannot resolve the correspondingly twice longer period with
our spectral resolution, as addressed above. (ii) The global ver-
tical kink mode could also explain the breathing of the ellipse.
However, again the global harmonic of the kink mode should
have twice the period of the ﬁrst harmonic, which is not ob-
served in our case. (iii) Therefore, the best candidate to describe
the oscillations of the ellipse axes lengths seems to be the ﬁrst
harmonic of the m = 2 ﬂute mode. The panels corresponding
to the large (top) and small (middle) axes of the ARs in Fig. 2
clearly show that they oscillate in antiphase. This pleads in fa-
vor of the m = 2 mode. We calculated the phase speed of the
presumed ﬁrst harmonic of the standing ﬂute (ballooning) os-
cillation modes, which we associate with the ellipse or convex
hull axes lengths (or AR area) oscillations by vph = L/P, where
2h is the loop length, and P denotes the oscillation period of
L
the axes. The phase speed estimates were made for mean, mini-
mum, and maximum oscillation periods. Similar estimates were
made for the kink mode, and the data corresponding to the two
types of modes are compiled in Table 3. Therefore, we summa-
rize that the characteristic parameters of the possible standing
ﬂute modes also completely agree with the conclusions drawn
above.

6. Conclusions

Using a novel method of automated AR pattern detection, we
developed an algorithm that enables the investigation of AR dy-
namics, based on a least-squares ﬁtting of elliptic patterns. We
used the so-called convex hull as a reference for the validation.
Using this approach, we identiﬁed the AR boundary points by
determining magnetic ﬁeld gradients between neighboring pix-
els that exceed the threshold value 40 Gauss/pixel. Furthermore,
the computational heuristics include mapping of the AR shape
on the elliptical shape using a least-squares ﬁtting procedure or
a convex hull form. This novel approach enables the determina-
tion of the AR dynamics and represents a powerful new diagnos-
tic tool for studying intrinsic kinematic properties of ARs.

We applied the method to the two ARs numbered 11327 and
11726. We discovered that the inclination angles of the corre-
sponding ellipse major or convex hull axes oscillate with respect
to the solar equatorial plane with characteristic periods of about
4.6 to 4.9 hours. We interpreted these oscillations in terms of the
standing second harmonic of kink modes, sustained in two paral-
lel ﬂux tubes (sunspots) with similar properties but opposite po-
larity, connected by small loops located in the solar atmosphere.
We assumed that the ARs oscillate as a whole system, and the
corresponding kink mode has a node in the apex above the solar
surface. This assumption enabled us to detect the possible dis-
tribution of their phase speed values along the tubes in a rather
seismological manner.

We compared the results obtained for fast and slow kink

modes, and for each case we concluded the following.

1. The mean velocity values corresponding to the entire depth
of the convection zone h = 200 000 km are inconsistent with
this assumption as the obtained mean phase velocity values
are higher than their surface values. Therefore, our analysis
shows that in our setup, the modes propagating to that depth
are practically ruled out.

2. The characteristic depths of the turning point of waves that
might satisfy the requirements of the current preliminary
modeling must be at most about 40 000 km, where pre-
sumably the sunspot structure should break up into smaller
ﬂux tubes anchored down in the tachocline, which is in
coincidence with helioseismic detection of sunspot depth
(Gizon et al., 2009), although both methods of depth estima-
tion are rather indicative and require further development of
the modeling with stricter mathematical rigor.

3. Our modeling might become a basis for further development
of a seismological tool for the determination of AR struc-
tures.

Based on the AR pattern automated detection model,
more rigorous magneto-seismological tools can be introduced
(Nakariakov, 2001; Chorley et al., 2011; Hoeksema et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2010), which would include consistent forward-
and inverse-modeling components. The latter also concerns the
dynamics of both major and minor axes sizes that also show
strong oscillatory behavior. Here, we showed an illustrative ex-
ample to interpret these long-period oscillations. The formalism
we used is based on the theory of MHD waves in magnetic cylin-
ders (Roberts, 2000; Edwin & Roberts, 1983; Nakariakov et al.,
2003), although the structures we considered have a variable
density along the ﬁeld lines. However, our approach still en-
ables a rough estimation of the mean propagation speeds, and the
precision of these measurements is good enough to characterize
the phase speed proﬁles inside the sunspots semi-qualitatively
(quantitatively) and to evaluate the anchoring depth of the ARs.

A more thorough analysis of these oscillations requires more so-
phisticated analytical and numerical methods (tools). This type
of investigation, however, is beyond the main scope of the cur-
rent paper and will be addressed elsewhere.

Appendix A: Least-squares mapping of

second-order curves

A second-order curve that satisﬁes an algebraic equation of the
second degree

Ax2 + 2Bxy + Cy2 + 2Dx + 2Ey + F = 0.

(A.1)

Here A, B, C, D, E, and F are the unknowns, (x, y) are
the obtained coordinates of the automatically detected data.
Appropriately, we obtain a homogeneous system with six un-
knowns and many equations that always have trivial resolution.
We divide all coeﬃcients on A to reduce the number of un-
knowns by one in the obtained algebraic equations. We can de-
velop a least-squares minimization using these equations, which
is optimal among all other methods for the determination. In this
way, we obtain formulae for the coeﬃcients of the second-order
curve.

The coeﬃcients, which ensure that the obtained curve is el-
lipse, must satisfy the conditions: ∆ , 0, J > 0 and ∆/I < 0,
where

∆ =

J= A B

I = A + C.

By the boundary points outlined, the second-order curve,
which is the ellipse, has been constructed by the obtained co-
eﬃcients. The parameters of the ellipse have also been found
through them, such as the major and minor semi-axes
