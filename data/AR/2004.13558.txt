A Graph-constrained Changepoint Detection Approach for
ECG Segmentation

Atiyeh Fotoohinasab, Toby Hocking, and Fatemeh Afghah,

Abstract—Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is the most
commonly used non-invasive tool
in the assessment of
cardiovascular diseases. Segmentation of the ECG signal
to locate its constitutive waves, in particular the R-peaks,
is a key step in ECG processing and analysis. Over the
years, several segmentation and QRS complex detection
algorithms have been proposed with different features;
however, their performance highly depends on applying
preprocessing steps which makes them unreliable in real-
time data analyzing of ambulatory care settings and remote
monitoring systems, where the collected data is highly
noisy. Moreover, some issues are still remained with the
current algorithms in regard to the diverse morphological
categories for the ECG signal and their high computa-
tion cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-
based optimal changepoint detection (GCCD) method for
reliable detection of R-peak positions without employing
any preprocessing step. The proposed model guarantees
to compute the globally optimal changepoint detection
solution. It is also generic in nature and can be applied to
other time-series biomedical signals. Based on the MIT-BIH
arrhythmia (MIT-BIH-AR) database, the proposed method
achieves overall sensitivity Sen = 99.76, positive predictivty
PPR = 99.68, and detection error rate DER = 0.55 which
are comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches1.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a quasi-periodical,
rhythmically repeating biomedical signal that includes
information about the electrical activities of cardiac mus-
cle. One cycle of ECG, called a heartbeat, is delineated
by arrangements of P, QRS-complex and T waveforms as
well as PQ and ST segments. Out of all the waveforms,
the QRS-complex is the most striking waveform as it
represents the ventricular depolarization and reﬂects the
major part of the electrical activity of the heart. Precisely
detecting the location of R-peak as the highest and the
only positive peak within the QRS complex plays a
critical role in obtaining the morphology of the QRS-
complex. Besides, the localization of R-peak serves as
the basis for the automated determination of the heart
rate and thereby, it is a signiﬁcant criterion for discerning
any heart abnormality. Not only heart diseases but also
many other diseases can be diagnosed in a non-invasive
way using R-peak detection due to the relationship

between heart rate variability (HRV) and several physio-
logical systems (vasomotor, respiratory, central nervous,
thermoregulatory, etc.). Revealing R-peaks is a simple
task in noise-free ECG signals; however, the challenge
emerges when the ECG signal is corrupted by noise and
artifacts.

Several methods have been proposed to detect differ-
ent waves in the ECG signal. However, the majority of
these methods still suffer from several drawbacks such
as misdetection of ECG waveforms with determinant
morphological patterns in some life-threatening heart
arrhythmias, or the high complexity of the algorithm that
is a barrier for online processing or long-recording analy-
sis. Typically, current methods consist of two main steps;
pre-processing, and detection. In the pre-processing step,
the algorithm attempts to eliminate the noise and ar-
tifacts, and highlight the relevant sections of the ECG
[1], [19]. In the second step, most of the methods locate
R-peaks using the result from the pre-processing step
in the ﬁrst place,
then other waves are detected by
deﬁning a set of heuristic rules [9]. However, in real-time
data processing of ambulatory care settings and remote
monitoring systems, where the collected data is highly
noisy, preprocessing-based algorithms are less effective.
Besides, the performance of most detection algorithms
depends highly on the used dataset, and also, incorrect
detection of R-peak leads to the incorrect identiﬁcation
of other waves.

Most of the state-of-the-art methods in the ﬁeld of
ECG waves detection are either based on the wavelet
transform, Hidden Markov models (HMM), and simple
inte-
mathematical operations such as differentiation,
gration, and squaring. Wavelet transform is a common
approach to capture non-stationary behaviors of the
ECG signal [17]. However, the caveat with the Wavelet
transform is the difﬁculty in determining a proper mother
wavelet derived from the various shape of the QRS-
complex and ﬁnding the required threshold in the detec-
tion step. More importantly, discrete wavelet transforms
(DWT) often fail to derive reliable results from short-
recordings of the signal. Algorithms stem from simple
mathematical operations are computationally efﬁcient,
and thereby ideal for real-time analysis of the large
data sets. Pan and Tompkins [16] algorithm and its
modiﬁcations [5] are the most popular techniques in this
category. However, their high performance is guaranteed

in case of the ECG signal

 
 
 
 
 
 
the noise. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are also
graphical models that have highly drawn attention in
the task of ECG segmentation in order to consider the
temporal dependency among the waveforms. In addition
to the aforementioned methods, some studies addressed
the problem of ECG delineation using deep learning.
Although deep learning-based algorithms demonstrated
high performance in the classiﬁcation problems, they
rely on large scale datasets for training the algorithm
and suffer from the imbalanced class problem [15], [13],
[11], [14], [12], [18].

In this work, we leverage a graph-constrained change-
point detection (GCCD) model introduced by Hocking
et al. in [7] in order to detect R-peak positions in a
fast and effective way. Hocking et al. [7] proposed an
algorithm that can solve changepoint detection problems
with graph constraints on segment’s means with log-
linear complexity in the amount of data, thereby has high
efﬁciency on huge data sets. Their model can represent a
time series signal as a set of constant value segments of
varying lengths, as well as their precise locations over
space or time. They have shown that their model has
high accuracy in detecting abrupt changes in genomic
data such as DNA copy number proﬁles [8] and ChIP-
sequencing [6]. In this paper, we indicate that this model
not only is applicable for a periodic signal but also
can outperform other state-of-the-art methods concerned
with ECG delineation.

There are a few studies in the literature that have
exploited changepoint detection models to ﬁnd abrupt
changes in heart rhythm. However, up to our best
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study where a changepoint
detection model is used to segment ECG waveforms.
One of the key contributions of this work is using graphs
to some extent employ biological prior knowledge of
the signal into the model and lessen the complexity
of the model. The proposed method does not need a
pre-processing step since it leverages the sparsity of
changepoints to denoising the signal as well as detecting
abrupt changes. As a result, it can be more effective in
real-time processing of noisy data. Besides, GCCD takes
the whole cardiac beat into account to detect and study
each wave separately, as opposed to most of the current
methods which use the location of R-wave to detect other
waves.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
the next section, we describe the proposed Graph-
Constrained Changepoint Detection model and its ap-
plication in localization of R-peak. Section III provides
a description of the dataset used in this study and a
discussion of the results as well as a comparison between
the performance of the proposed algorithm and other
state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, IV summarizes this
research work and its contribution.

II. METHODOLOGY
The proposed method treats the problem of ECG
waveforms delineation as a changepoint detection prob-
lem over a non-stationary ECG signal. It represents the
periodic ECG signal as piece-wise locally stationary
pieces so as each piece is the mean of one segment of
data points. The model takes a raw ECG signal and a
predeﬁned graph, which encodes expected changepoints
from the signal, as inputs and yields the onset/offset
and the mean of desired segments. Figure 1 illustrates
an overview of the proposed algorithm in detecting
waveforms of a normal ECG. In the next sections, we
will brieﬂy describe the GCCD model.

A. Graph-Constrained Changepoint Detection Model

Let us assume a constrained changepoint model rep-
resented with a graph G = (V, E), where the vertices
V ∈ {1, . . . , |V |} represent the hidden states or seg-
ments (not necessarily a waveform), and the directed
edges E ∈ {1, . . . , |E|} represent the possible changes
between the states or segments. Each edge e ∈ E
encodes the following associated data based on the prior
knowledge of expected sequences of changes:

• The source ve ∈ V and target ve ∈ V vertices/states

for a changepoint e from ve to ve.

• A non-negative penalty constant λe ∈ R+ which is

the cost of changepoint e.

• A constraint function ge : R×R → R which deﬁnes
the possible mean values before and after each
changepoint e. If mi is the mean before the change-
point and mi+1 is the mean after the changepoint,
then the constraint is ge(mi, mi+1) ≤ 0. These
functions can be used to constrain the direction
(up or down) and/or the magnitude of the change
(greater/less than a certain amount).

Mathematically, given the

=
{y1, . . . , yn} and the graph G = (V, E), ﬁnding change-
points c, segment means m, and hidden states s can be
executed by solving the following optimization problem:

The above equation consists of a data-ﬁtting term
involving the negative log-likelihood (cid:96) of each data
point, and a model complexity term involving the cost
of each changepoint λci. More speciﬁcally, the positive
penalty parameter λ regularizes the number of predicted
changepoints/segments by the model. A larger penalty λ

Fig. 1: An overview of the Graph-Constrained Changepoint Detection (GCCD) model. The GCCD model takes a
constraint graph and a raw ECG signal as inputs, and then, detects segments corresponding to the nodes of the
constraint graph at the output. The up/down arrows above each edge represents the expected up/down change in
the segment means, respectively. In this model, the proposed constraint graph has a vertex for each main waveform
(i.e. P, Q, R, S, T ) as well as Baselines (B1-B3), which are intermediate states.

yields a changepoint vector c which is more sparse, or
more speciﬁcally, reduces the number of changepoints.
The constraint function ge also encodes the expected
up/down change and the least amplitude gap between
the mean of two states. For all possible changes i such
that ci = 0, the constraint (2) enforces no change in
mean mi = mi+1 and state si = si+1 variables. For all
possible changes i such that ci (cid:54)= 0, the constraint (3)
enforces a change in mean speciﬁed by the constraint
function gci (mi, mi+1) ≤ 0, and a change in state
, vci ). Besides, the above optimization
(si, si+1) = (vci
problem exploits the dynamic programming algorithm to
recursively compute cost functions over the data points
and hidden states.

B. ECG Waveforms Detection

At ﬁrst, the topology of the constraint graph G and
its corresponding parameters are deﬁned based on the
different possible morphologies for each waveform (P-,
QRS-, T-waveforms, etc.) over one heart cycle. This con-
straint graph speciﬁes biological prior knowledge about
the expected morphological changes within one cycle
of ECG. More speciﬁcally, each node in the constraint
graph serves an expected hidden state/segment in the
signal, and each edge encodes the required conditions
for the transition to a new state. These conditions are
determined based on the expected minimum amplitude
difference of two successive segments and the polarity
of a waveform. Then, the GCCD model segments the
raw ECG signal using the prior knowledge provided by
the constraint graph. It is worth re-emphasizing that any
preprocessing step is no longer required with the GCCD
model.

III. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES

A. Dataset

We evaluated the GCCD model using the MIT-BIH
arrhythmia (MIT-BIH-AR) database consists of 48 ECG
recordings taken from 47 subjects, and each recording
is sampled at 360 Hz and 30 min in length with 200
mV amplitude resolution [10], [4]. Each recording is
composed of two ambulatory ECG channels from the
modiﬁed lead II (MLII) and one of the modiﬁed leads
V1, V2, V4, or V5. In this study, only the MLII was
used, and thereby the records 102 and 107 were excluded
from consideration. The database contains annotations of
both heartbeat class information and R-wave positions
information veriﬁed by two or more expert cardiologists
independently. We employed the provided annotations
for R-wave positions to evaluate the performance of the
proposed algorithm.

B. Experimental Results

Fig. 2 demonstrates an example of the performance of
this proposed model in the localization of R-peak for a
window of two records (# 100 and #230) from the MIT-
BIH-AR dataset. The performance of R-peak detection
algorithms is usually evaluated in terms of sensitivity
(Sen), positive predictivity rate (PPR) and detection error
rate (DER), which are calculated by:

Sen(%) =

In order to compare the performance of the proposed
method against other methods in the literature, we
adopted the above statistical metrics for the evaluation
of the GCCD algorithm. Table I represents the R-peak
detection success for GCCD algorithm considering all 48
records in the MIT-BIH dataset. As the table shows, the
proposed method achieves notable results, Sen = 99.76,
PPR = 99.68, and DER = 0.55, in R-peak detection.
The constraint graph for each record is deﬁned manually
by matching the overall morphological properties of the
signal
to pre-speciﬁed categories for each waveform
[20]. All the Sen and PPR values are higher than 99%
except 6 cases. For 26 cases of detection in the dataset,
Sen and PPR values are 100% separately. Records where
the Sen and PPR values are less than 99% are mainly
due to two reasons: in some cycles of the record, the
morphology of the QRS-complex possesses no R-peak,
or the amplitude of the R-peak is too low compared
to the amplitude of its next negative peak; S wave. It
worth to mention that the results for records 105 and
108, as the noisiest records in the data set, demonstrate
the capability of the model in the detection of R-peak
locations in the presence of high noise level without
using a preprocessing step for removing the noise. Table
II compares the performance of the GCCD algorithm
against other state-of-the-art methods. Results in this
table present that the performance of the proposed model
without using any preprocessing step is comparable to
the other R-wave detection methods in the literature
using a preprocessing step.

The results provided in this research work justiﬁes that
changepoint detection models are promising approaches
for the detection of ECG waveforms. The proposed
model has the ability to detect R-peak positions for
various morphologies of the ECG. Additionally, GCCD
model can potentially detect other waveforms than R
wave (i.e, P,Q,S, and T waves) by including their cor-
responding knowledge to the constraint graph. In this
research work, we only detect R-peak positions since
the MIT-BIH-AR database has just provided with the
annotations for this peak. As mentioned before, for some
cases in the database, the performance of the GCCD
model is notably low due to the absence of the R-peak
or the low amplitude of this peak in some cycles. The
efﬁciency of the GCCD model for these speciﬁc cases
can be enhanced by using a multi-path constraint graph.
A multi-path constraint graph is useful in identifying all
ECG waveforms as well as QS-complex possessing no
R-peak. Additionally, the constraint graph can be learned
in a batch mode based on each record to surmise the
model from the manual deﬁnition of the constraint graph,
which is considered as future work.

IV. CONCLUSION
The detection of ECG waveforms plays a paramount
role in most of the automated ECG analysis tools. The
