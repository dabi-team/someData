Abstract.  Propylene  oxide  is  one  of  the  simplest  organic  chiral  molecules  and  has  attracted  considerable 

interest from the scientific community a few years ago, when it was discovered in the interstellar medium. 

Here,  we  report  a  preliminary  study  on  the  interaction  between  propylene  oxide  and  rare-gas  atoms, 

specifically He, Ne, and Ar. The interaction potentials as a function of the distance between the center-of-

mass  of  propylene  oxide  and  the  rare-gas-atom  are  calculated  for  fourteen  leading  configurations  at 

CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory has been employed for the 

analysis  of the intermolecular  potential,  revealing  that  most of  the  contribution is  given  by  dispersion  and 

exchange forces.  

1. Introduction 

Propylene  oxide is  one of  the  simplest  organic  chiral  molecules,  making  it  an  ideal  candidate  for 

studies concerning chiral selectivity mechanisms [1, 2]. It is characterized by a high vapor pressure 

and  stability  that  makes  this  molecule  suitable  for  scattering  experiments,  where  high  beam 

intensity and duty cycle are important.  Its commercial availability is also remarkable  for both the 

racemic  mixture  and  the  two  enantiomers.  It  has  been  largely  studied  both  experimentally,  for 

example by synchrotron radiation [3]  and molecular beams [4, 5], and from a computational point 

of view. For this latter aspect, see for example the representation of the potential energy surfaces of 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
propylene oxide with helium[6, 7] and the study of the structural isomers manifold of C3H6O [8]. 

Recent  discovery  in  the  interstellar  medium  of  this  molecule  [9]  determined  unusual  interest, 

considering that numerous organic, even complex, molecules are continuously discovered [10–12].  

In  this  work,  we  present  the  study  by  a  quantum  mechanical  approach  of  the  binary  interaction 

between propylene oxide and the rare gas atoms He, Ne and Ar. Ab initio calculations have been carried out 

at different levels of theory to determine the most stable geometry of the molecule and the energy profiles of 

some significant configurations, called leading configurations (see also refs.[13, 14]), chosen upon physical 

and  geometrical  considerations.  The  ab  initio  points  have  been  fitted  with  a  fifth-order  Rydberg  potential 

function [15].  The Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) method has been employed to calculate 

electric  properties  of  the  systems  propylene  oxide  –  rare-gas  atom,  such  as  dipole  moment,  polarizability, 

quadrupole moment, ionization potential, electron affinity and proton affinity. These properties are employed 

for  a  preliminary  analysis  of  electrostatic,  exchange,  induction  and  dispersion  contributions  to  the 

intermolecular  forces.  The detailed study  of  prototype  propylene  oxide-  noble  gas  systems  is  also  basic to 

formulate the force fields (FF) and then to carry out molecular dynamics simulations in these and in other 

systems at increasing complexity and of major interest for the chiral recognition. 

The article is structured as follows: in Section 2, we give a background of the quantum mechanical 

methods  we  employed  and  describe  the  leading  configurations;  in  Section  3,  we  discuss  the  results;  in 

Section 4, final remarks end the paper. 

2. Background 

2.1.  Geometry  optimization  and  calculation  of  potential  energy  profile  of  the  leading 

configurations 

The structure of propylene oxide has been optimized by  Gaussian package [16] at various levels of  theory 

(Table 1). One hundred energy points have been calculated at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ by using MOLPRO 

[17] for a certain number of representative configurations, including the counterpoise correction to the basis 

set superposition error. As mentioned in Section 1, the choice of the representative configurations, namely 

leading  configurations,  relay  on  geometric  and  physical  considerations  of  the  system.  The  leading 

2 

 
 
 
 
configurations of  propylene  oxide  –  He  were  discussed  in  Ref.  [6]  (see  also  [18])  and  the  same  choice  is 

applied  to  the  systems  propylene  oxide  –  Ne  and  propylene  oxide  –  Ar.    Propylene  oxide  molecule  is 

considered as built in a distorted tetrahedron (Figure 1), where the carbon atoms of CH3 and CH2 fragments, 

referred as C3 and C2, the oxygen, O, and the hydrogen, H, atom bound to the asymmetric carbon are the 

vertices. Fourteen configurations have been identified and indicated by the letters V, E and F, that stand for 

vertex, edge and face of the tetrahedron, respectively (Figure 2). In the four V configurations, the rare-gas-

atom lies through the vertex – center-of-mass of propylene oxide direction. V1 is directed toward C3, V2 in 

correspondence  of  C2,  V3  toward  O,  and  V4  along  the  H  –  center-of-mass  direction  H.  For  the  E 

configurations, the direction of the rare-gas-atom is referred to the line that connects the center-of-mass of 

the  molecule  and  the  center-of-mass  of  the  edge  of  the  tetrahedron,  defined  by  the  center-of-mass  of  two 

vertices. In the determination of the centers-of-mass of the edges involving C3 and C2, the whole masses of 

the  groups  CH3  and  CH2  have  been  considered.  Thus,  E1  represents  the  configuration  directed  in 

correspondence  of  the  center-of-mass  of  the  edge  C3-C2;  E2  corresponds  to the  center-of-mass  C3-O,  E3 

goes through C3-H, E4 through C2-O, E5 through C2-H, finally, and E6 is in correspondence of the center-

of-mass of the edge O-H. The F configurations are defined as the directions that connect the rare-gas-atom to 

the centers-of-mass of the faces of the distorted tetrahedron and the center-of-mass of the molecule: in F1, 

the rare-gas is directed toward the center-of-mass of C3-C2-O, in F2 through C3-C2-H, in F3 through C3-O-

H, and in F4 through the center of mass of C2-O-H. 

The analytical form of the potential energy surface for the fourteen leading configurations is built by 

fitting a fifth degree generalized Rydberg function, V(R), to the calculated ab initio points:

where De, ai, Req and Eref are adjustable parameters (see Supporting Information). The adjustable parameters 

have  been  obtained  by  a  non-linear  least-square  procedure  that  minimized  the  differences  between  the 

analytic energies obtained by the potential function reported above and the ab initio energy points. 

2.2. Symmetry adapted perturbation theory calculations 

The  SAPT  method  has  been  performed  using  the  PSI4  code  [19]  at  the  CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ  level  of 

theory, on the configuration  of minimum energy, among those considered in this work. In SAPT, the total 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Hamiltonian for the molecule – atom system is partitioned as H = F + V + W, where F = FA + FB is the sum 

of the Fock operators for monomers A and B, V is the intermolecular interaction operator, and W = WA +WB 

is the sum of the Møller-Plesset operators. The Fock operators are treated as zero-order Hamiltonian, while 

the interaction energy is evaluated through a perturbative expansion of V given by: 

𝐸(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3047) = ∑

(cid:2998)

The  polarization  energies  E(nj)

pol  are  identical  to  the  corrections  obtained  in  a  regular  Rayleigh-

Schrödinger  perturbation  theory  and  the  exchange  corrections  E(nj)

exch  arise  from  the  use  of  a  global 

antisymmetrizer to force the correct permutation symmetry of the dimer wave function in each order, hence 

the name “symmetry adaptation”. In this way, the interaction energy given by SAPT can be written as: 

𝐸(cid:3020)(cid:3002)(cid:3017)(cid:3021) = 𝐸(cid:3032)(cid:3039)(cid:3046)(cid:3047) + 𝐸(cid:3032)(cid:3051)(cid:3030)(cid:3035) + 𝐸(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3031) + 𝐸(cid:3031)(cid:3036)(cid:3046)(cid:3043)   

Using higher-order SAPT, as SAPT2+3, the electrostatic part is represented by: 

𝐸(cid:3032)(cid:3039)(cid:3046)(cid:3047) = 𝐸(cid:3032)(cid:3039)(cid:3046)(cid:3047)

The  superscript  defines  the  order  in  V,  while  the  subscript,  resp,  means  that  orbital  relaxation  effects  are

3. Results and Discussion 

In Table 1, we report the  structural  properties of the optimized geometry of propylene  oxide, calculated at 

various levels of theory and compared with reference data. The CBS-QB3 method [22] presents overall the 

best agreement with reference data, for both distances  and angles. Thus, the  geometry  optimized  by CBS-

QB3 is chosen for the calculation of the interaction potentials of the leading configurations as a function of 

the distance and for the analysis of the contributions to the intermolecular forces.  

Potential  energy profiles  of  the leading  configurations  of  propylene  oxide  – He  have  been  already 

presented and discussed in Ref. [6], where they have been compared with the Pirani potential function, aka 

Improved Lennard-Jones. Here, we use a fifth order Rydberg potential function, as discussed in Section 2.2 

for the three systems. The single point energies of propylene oxide with the He, Ne and Ar are reported in 

Figures 3, 4 and 5, respectively. For propylene oxide – He, the minimum energy configuration is F1, at ca. 

45 cm-1 and 3.7 Å followed by E5, at a similar value of energy, but with an equilibrium distance of ca. 4.2 Å. 

The stability of F1 is probably due to hindrance steric reasons and to the polarizability effect of the groups 

CH3,  CH2  and  O  atom.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  comparison  with  the  systems  propylene  oxide  –  Ne  and 

propylene oxide – Ar, where F1 is also in these cases the leading configuration with the minimum energy. 

Among the V configurations, V1 is the most stable for the three systems; V1, V2 and V3 present also similar 

values  of the  equilibrium, while  V4,  where  the rare-gas  atom  is  directed  along  the  H,  is  less  stable  and at 

higher values of the equilibrium distance. Configurations E3 and E5, i. e. the “edges” CH3 – H and CH2 – H, 

also  present  higher  values  of  the  minimum  energy  and  equilibrium  distance,  with  respect  to  the  other  E 

configurations.  Concerning  F  configurations,  F2  and  F3  present  the  highest  repulsive  character.  It  is 

important to point out that the potential energy profiles of the leading configurations have a similar trend for 

the three systems. As  mentioned  above, F1 is  the  configuration of minimum energy  for the three  systems. 

For propylene oxide – He, F1 presents a minimum energy of 36.9 cm-1 at 3.6 Å; for propylene oxide – Ne, 

the depth of the potential well is ca. 60.7    

cm-1 at 3.7Å; finally, for propylene oxide – Ar, we have a minimum of 169.3 cm-1 at 3.9Å.  

In Table 2, we show the minimum energy and equilibrium distances for the three molecule – rare-

gas-atom  systems  calculated  at  the  CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ  level  of  theory  in  the  F1  configuration, 

comparing  the  results  with  and  without  counterpoise  correction  for  the  basis  set  superposition  error.  The 

result shows that the counterpoise correction tends to increase the equilibrium distance of about 0.2 Å for all 

the systems. However, the most significant effect is found in the minimum energy, where the counterpoise 

correction  considerably  decreases  the  attractive  component  of  the  potential.  For  the  propylene  oxide  –  He 

systems,  the  potential  calculated  without  counterpoise  correction  is  twice  as  attractive  than  that  calculated 

5 

 
with the counterpoise  correction, while for propylene  oxide  –  Ne and  – Ar systems this  difference  is even 

higher.  We  must  note  that  the  lower  values  of  energy  are  probably  the  result  of  an  overcorrection  effect, 

especially  considering  the limitation  of  the  basis  set.  Table  3  reports  the  difference  between  the  minimum 

energy  and  equilibrium  distance  calculated  ab  initio  with  and  without  counterpoise  correction,  confirming 

the trend already observed for the F1 configuration.  

Table 4 reports the electric properties: dipole moment, polarizability, quadrupole moment, ionization 

potential,  electron  affinity and  proton affinity,  for  the  three  systems  investigated.  For  propylene  oxide  the 

zero-point energy is also presented. These properties have been then employed to analyze the contributions 

to the interaction potentials [23–26]. 

Figure 5 compares the energy profiles at different SAPT correction levels for the F1 configuration. 

Except for the Hartree-Fock (HF), that presents repulsive character, all the corrections present similar energy 

profiles. For propylene oxide – He, the minimum has been obtained at SAPT2+(CCD) level, for propylene 

oxide – Ne at SAPT2+, and for propylene oxide - Ar at SAPT0.  

Figure 6 shows the interaction potential and the related contributions of the three systems for the F1 

configuration calculated at SAPT2+(3)(CCD) level of theory. As expected, the equilibrium distance and the 

minimum energy increases with the atomic mass of the rare gas atom. The plots show that a fundamental role 

is played by dispersion forces, whose attractive character is  already present in the long-range distance and 

increases by passing from He, to Ne and Ar.  The exchange contribution, which presents a purely repulsive 

character, also depends on the atomic mass of the rare gas atom and its effect, as well as that of dispersion 

forces,  is  present  at  increasing  distances  moving  from  He  to  Ar.  Induction  and  electrostatic  contributions 

have been also considered in this treatment; their contribution is negligible in the long- and medium- range 

of  distances.  For  what  concerns  the  electrostatic  contribution,  it  becomes  attractive  in  the  vicinity  of  the 

potential-well, where the dispersion and exchange forces play the most important role, thus the contribution 

of  the  electrostatic  interactions  is  almost  negligible.  Even  lower  is  the  effect  of  induction  forces,  whose 

attractive character becomes relevant in the short range of distances, where the repulsive contribution of the 

exchange forces conceals all the other contributions. Table 4 compares the minimum obtained from ab initio 

and  SAPT  calculation  for  the  configuration  F1.  The  energies  obtained  by  the  SAPT  and  ab  initio  method 

with counterpoise correction present a good agreement, with an error lower than 1% in energy

4. Final Remarks 

The interaction potential of fourteen configurations of the systems propylene oxide – rare-gas-atoms (He, Ne 

and  Ar)  have  been  calculated  at  the  CCSDT(t)  level  of  theory,  using  the  aug-cc-pVDZ  basis  set.  The 

geometry of propylene oxide, modeled as rigid, has been optimized at various levels of theory and CBS-Q3 

gave the best agreement with reference data. The analytical form of the potential energy surface is generated 

by fitting the single  point energies with a  fifth-order generalize Rydberg  potential function.   The potential 

energy profiles of the three systems present a similar trend and F1 is the most stable leading configuration 

for  all  the  three  rare-gases.  As  expected,  the  minimum  energy  of  the  leading  configuration  become  more 

negative passing from the He to the Ne ad the Ar. Similarly, the equilibrium distances become larger.  

The SAPT method has been applied for a preliminary analysis of the contributions to the interaction 

potentials from the calculated electric properties. The three systems present a similar behavior; the repulsive 

contribution  is  given  exclusively  the  exchange  interaction,  while  the  dispersion  forces  play  the  most 

important role for what concerns the attractive character in the portion of distances we have considered. 

Future developments, addressed to build up FFs useful for molecular dynamics simulations of chiral effects, 

will  involve  experimental  investigations  on  propylene  oxide  –  rare  gas  collision  processes,  useful    for  an 

accurate analysis of  the nature and for a general formulation of the interaction potentials (see for example 

[27–29])..  For  a  further  validity  test  of  predicted  intermolecular  interactions  it  is  also  of  fundamental 

importance their comparison with results of quantum mechanical calculations that make use of more accurate 

basis set functions.

Figure 1. The propylene oxide molecule: in white the hydrogen atoms; in grey the carbons C1, C2 and C3; 

in red the oxygen. 

Figure 2. The propylene oxide is represented as a distorted tetrahedron, whose vertices are the H, O, C2, and 

C3; the edges are indicated by thick black lines. The leading configurations are classified as V, E and F. The 

four V configurations correspond to the rare-gas atom directed through the vertices of the tetrahedron and the 

center-of-mass of the molecule (black dot); in V1 the rare-gas atom is directed through C3, in V2 through 

C2, in V3 through O, and in V4 through H (the direction of the V configurations are indicated by a black 

line). The six leading configurations E correspond to the direction (red line) connecting the center-of-mass of 

the molecule and the centers-of-mass of the six edges of the tetrahedron (red dots). The four leading con-

figurations F correspond to the direction (blue line) connecting the center-of-mass of the molecule and the 

centers-of-mass of the faces of the tetrahedron (blue dots). 

Figure 3. Potential energy curves of propylene oxide – He of the fourteen leading configurations. The ab 

initio points are indicated by symbols and the Rydberg fitting by lines. 

Figure 4. Potential energy curves of propylene oxide – Ne of the fourteen leading configurations. The ab 

initio points are indicated by symbols and the Rydberg fitting by lines. 

Figure 5. Potential energy curves of propylene oxide – Ar of the fourteen leading configurations. The ab 

initio points are indicated by symbols and the Rydberg fitting by lines.
