Chondrites stem from undiÔ¨Äerentiated asteroidal parent bodies that nevertheless experienced
a certain degree of metamorphism after their formation in the early solar system. Maximum
temperatures of metamorphism depend mainly on formation time and the abundance of the main
heating source, which is short-lived 26Al (half life 720 000yr).

Enstatite chondrites formed under reducing conditions and include many strongly metamor-
phosed members of petrologic type 6. We model the thermal evolution of the parent body of
the low metal enstatite chondrite class (EL). The model takes into account accretion, heating,
sintering and compaction by hot pressing of the initially porous material, temperature dependent
heat conductivity, and insulation eÔ¨Äects by the remaining regolith layer.

A Ô¨Åt of key parameters of the parent body comprising formation time, radius, and porosity is
achieved by Ô¨Åtting thermal histories of EL6 chondrites (LON 94100, Neuschwanstein, Khairpur,
BlithÔ¨Åeld, Daniel‚Äôs Kuil) constrained mainly by I-Xe and Ar-Ar ages and their respective closure
temperatures. Viable Ô¨Åts are obtained for parent bodies with 120 ‚Äì 210 km radius, formed c. 1.8 ‚Äì
2.1 Ma after Ca,Al rich inclusions (CAIs), and an initial porosity of 30%, relatively independent
on initial disk temperatures. Optimised models with parent body formation-times > 1.95 Ma
after CAIs imply central core temperatures below incipient plagioclase silicate melting.

Thermal histories of the diÔ¨Äerent EL6 chondrites are indistinguishable and so are their burial
depths. While the exact layering depth is somewhat model dependent (c. 12‚Äì20 km), the thick-
ness of the layer from which all Ô¨Åve EL6 chondrites stem is < 1 km. Hence, an origin from a
quite small asteroidal fragment is possible, particular as most excavation ages inferred from cos-
mic ray exposure data are compatible with a separation as meter sized meteoroids from a small
Apollo asteroid 33 Ma ago.

1. Introduction

The asteroids between Mars and Jupiter are remnants of planetary building blocks of the early solar system. High
precision isotopic analyses and age dating of meteoritic fragments of asteroids record a chronology of formation of
solids and planetesimals that would otherwise not be accessible (e.g., TrieloÔ¨Ä and Palme, 2006). The oldest objects
in the solar system are calcium-aluminium rich inclusions (CAIs) that formed during a brief epoch 4.567 Ga ago in
the solar nebula. Planetesimals now located in the asteroid belt ‚Äî sourcing the meteorite Ô¨Çux to Earth ‚Äî started
forming nearly contemporaneously with CAIs (Kleine et al., 2005). Early formed planetesimals became diÔ¨Äerentiated
bodies with Fe,Ni cores and silicate mantles or basaltic crusts, as the high abundance of short lived nuclides previously
injected by nearby massive stars into the solar nebula liberated suÔ¨Écient decay energy to heat and melt km sized bodies
(Kleine et al., 2005; TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2009). 26Al turned out to be the most relevant heat source.

More primitive, undiÔ¨Äerentiated planetesimals likely accreted after most of the 26Al decayed, about 2 Ma after CAIs
and later (see, e.g., Miyamoto et al., 1981; Bennett and McSween, 1996; Hevey and Sanders, 2006; Sahijpal et al.,
2007; Sahijpal and Gupta, 2011; Kleine et al., 2008; Harrison and Grimm, 2010). These undiÔ¨Äerentiated bodies stored
primitive structures like chondrules, mm-sized former melt droplets that were produced before parent body accretion
in the solar nebula. Formation time and original size of these planetesimals can be inferred from the primordial
heating and cooling history that is preserved in the meteorites from diÔ¨Äerent layering depths in such parent bodies.
These meteorites cooled distinctly due to variable layering depth, parent body material properties (e.g., initial porosity,

Formation time and original size provide important constraints for formation scenarios of planetesimals by stream-
ing instabilities (e.g., Youdin and Goodman, 2005; Johansen et al., 2007, 2015b; Cuzzi et al., 2008) or pebble accre-
tion (e.g., Levison et al., 2015; Visser and Ormel, 2016; Klahr and Schreiber, 2020) during disk lifetimes of a few
Myr (Haisch et al., 2001; Pfalzner et al., 2015).

Previous studies already provided constraints on parent body properties inferred from cooling histories, such as
for the H, and L chondrite parent bodies (Harrison and Grimm, 2010; Henke et al., 2012b, 2013; Monnereau et al.,
2013; Gail et al., 2015; Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2018, 2019), the Acapulcoite-Lodranite parent body (Neumann et al., 2018),
or those of iron meteorites (Kleine et al., 2005).

Here, we model the parent body of enstatite chondrites with low metal content (EL chondrites), which originated
under exceptionally reducing conditions, likely closer to the sun than ordinary chondrites or carbonaceous chondrites
(El Goresy et al., 2017; Zellner et al., 1977). The cooling histories of such models are compared to the empirical
cooling histories of EL meteorites found by analysis of cooling times and closure temperatures for all EL meteorites
for which such data exist for at least two diÔ¨Äerent thermochronological systems. By an optimisation procedure we
determine a radius and formation time of a model for the parent body and the primordial burial depths of the meteorites
within their parent body which reproduces as close as possible the existing meteoritical data.

The plan of our paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the available set of thermochronological data for EL
chondrites, Section 3 describes the thermal evolution model, and Section 4 the Ô¨Åtting procedure between model and
meteoritic data. Section 5 discusses the results and gives our Ô¨Ånal conclusions. In appendix A we attempt to determine
the material properties required for constructing a thermal evolution model of a body composed of the kind of multi-
mineral granular matter found in EL chondrites.

2. Observational material

Previous model calculations of the thermal evolution of chondritic parent bodies were largely dedicated to ordinary
chondrite parent bodies and based on U-Pb-Pb and Ô¨Åssion track ages of phosphates (e.g., G√∂pel et al., 1994), Hf-W
ages of metal silicate separation (e.g., Kleine et al., 2009), and K-Ar (Ar-Ar) ages of chondritic plagioclase feldspar
(e.g., TrieloÔ¨Ä et al., 2003). Due to the reduced nature of enstatite chondrites (e.g., El Goresy et al., 2017), particularly
phosphate minerals are absent, and so are U-Pb age data. 182Hf-182W data were reported by Lee and Halliday (2000)
for some enstatite chondrites. However, these did not allow to precisely date metal silicate separation. A Hf-W age for
EL6 Hvittis was obtained by Kleine et al. (2009). Some 53Mn-53Cr ages were measured by Shukolyukov and Lugmair
(2004). However, only one data point for an EL chondrite (type 6 Khairpur, see Table 1). Moreover, the closure
temperature of the Mn-Cr system in enstatite whole rocks is hardly constrained (Ito and Ganguly, 2006; Ganguly et al.,
2007). Furthermore, a single Rb-Sr age exists for Khairpur by Torigoye and Shima (1993).

On the other hand, Ar-Ar age data were presented by Bogard et al. (2010) and Hopp et al. (2014). While Bogard et al.
(2010) found ‚Äúproblematic" ages which partly exceeded the age of the solar system, Hopp et al. (2014) realised that
precise isochrons have to be evaluated in order to correct excess argon, which can be considered as part of trapped gases
which are much more abundant in enstatite than in ordinary chondrites (Crabb and Anders, 1981). Ages recalculated
for updated 40K decay constants (Schwarz et al., 2011; Renne et al., 2011) are listed in Table 1, however only Ar-Ar
ages of LON94100 and Neuschwanstein are corrected for trapped argon. As closure temperature we may refer to the
value of 550 K (Pellas et al., 1997; TrieloÔ¨Ä et al., 2003) calculated for sodic chondritic plagioclase, which occurs in
both equilibrated ordinary and enstatite chondrites (Zipfel et al., 2010; Weisberg and Kimura, 2012). Although other
K bearing phases occur, e.g., djerÔ¨Åsherite, these may not contribute a major portion of the K budget. Nevertheless,
in order to account for such minor phases with possibly diÔ¨Äerent closure temperature, we assume a somewhat larger
error of the closure temperature of 70 K.

Another chronometer successfully applied to enstatite chondrites is 129I‚Äì129Xe dating (Kennedy et al., 1988; Hopp et al.,

2016). The situation is quite diÔ¨Äerent to ordinary chondrites, where whole rock I‚ÄìXe ages are diÔ¨Écult to interpret due
to unknown carrier phases and closure temperatures, and only occasionally feldspar and phosphate mineral separates
where dated successfully (Brazzle et al., 1999). In the case of the mineralogically very diÔ¨Äerent enstatite chondrites,
early I‚ÄìXe studies (Kennedy, 1981; Kennedy et al., 1988) already pointed to enstatite (or inclusions in it) as main car-
rier phase, a view conÔ¨Årmed also in subsequent studies (BusÔ¨Åeld et al., 2008). The high retentivity of enstatite prevents
disturbance by secondary Xe loss and makes I‚ÄìXe ages more reliable. Recent calibrations involving the Shallowater
standard increased accuracy, corresponding I‚ÄìXe ages reported by Hopp et al. (2016) and Kennedy et al. (1988) ‚Äî
corrected for recent calibrations of the Bjurb√∂le versus the Shallowater standard (see Hopp et al., 2016) ‚Äî are listed
in Table 1. An important parameter not yet constrained, however, is the closure temperature, which is evaluated in the
following.

Similar to Ar-Ar dating, closure temperatures can be calculated for stepwise degassing experiments, particularly if
degassing experiments are performed with a high number of degassing steps. The xenon fraction released at speciÔ¨Åc
temperatures allows us to calculate diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients according to equations by Carslaw and Jaeger (1959) and

Reichenberg (1953), taking into account the temperature dependence of the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient:

ùê∑ = ùê∑0 e‚àíùëÑ‚àïùëÖgùëá ,

(1)

where ùëá is temperature, ùëÖg the gas constant, ùëÑ the activation energy, and ùê∑0 the pre-exponential or frequency factor.
Plotting ln ùê∑‚àïùëé2 versus 1‚àïùëá in arrhenius diagrams allows to calculate ùëÑ from the slope and ùê∑0‚àïùëé2 (ùëé: grain radius)
from the intercept of a linear regression, and from this a closure temperature from the Dodson (1973) formula (e.g.
TrieloÔ¨Ä et al., 1994; Pellas et al., 1997). In detail, we proceded as follows: According to the procedure as described in
TrieloÔ¨Ä et al. (1998) and (Pellas et al., 1997), we excluded the low temperature gas release from calculation of ln ùê∑‚àïùëé2,
as low temperature reservoirs seriously disturb the results, i.e. by shifting slope and activation energy to erroneously
low values. For the calculations we used the neutron induced iodogenic 128Xe fractional release of high temperature
extractions, from which chronological data were inferred. From the samples analysed we used only linear arrays with
correlation coeÔ¨Écients better than 0.9 (Neuschwanstein, see Fig. 1, LON94100, Khairpur) which yielded activation
energies of 132‚Äì137 kcal/mol and ln ùê∑0‚àïùëé2 values of 31‚Äì35, and corresponding closure temperatures of c. 990 K.
Considerung possible systematic uncertainties, we assign a preliminary estimate of the I-Xe closure temperature of
1 000 ¬± 100 K. We note that this value is indistinguishable from the estimate by Hopp et al. (2016) of 1 020 ¬± 100 K,
which was, however, a more rough estimate based on laboratory degassing temperatures of xenon versus argon.

In Table 1 we list the EL chondrites which were successfully dated by at least two thermochronological tools (I-Xe,
Ar-Ar, Mn-Cr, Rb-Sr). All these samples belong to petrologic type 6, which is the dominant petrologic type among
EL6 chondrites. EL6 chondrites are reported to have low shock stage S2 (Rubin et al., 1997), which is important to
avoid (or at least minimise) secondary disturbance of chronometers by impact metamorphism. For the optimisation
procedure (see below), we excluded Hvittis, as the two data points (Hf-W and I-Xe age) are essentially indistinguish-
able, nevertheless, we note the good agreement of the Hvittis I-Xe age with other EL6 samples. Furthermore, we
also excluded Zak≈Çodzie, as its genesis may involve impact metamorphism (see discussion below), and we exclude the
Mn-Cr data of Khairpur because of the highly uncertain closure temperature.

3. Thermal evolution model
3.1. Model assumptions

A model of the thermal evolution is calculated for a body with asteroidal size and material composition supposed

to be typical for EL chondrites. The basic assumptions of our model calculation are,

‚Ä¢ Ô¨Årst, that the body is formed out of the cold material in the accretion disc of the proto-sun and is internally heated
by decay of short-lived radioactives (particularly by 26Al) and cooled by heat transport to the surface where the
excess heat is radiated away,

‚Ä¢ second, that the body forms and grows to essentially its Ô¨Ånal radius within a period short compared to the half-life

of 26Al such that it starts its evolution cold before much of the decay energy is liberated,

‚Ä¢ and third, that the material forming the body shows initially an on-the-average homogeneous composition all

over the body despite its complex micro-structure.

We assume that during the evolution of the parent body of EL chondrites the peak temperature remains suÔ¨Éciently
low that the mineral and metal components of the chondritic material do not start melting at the burial depth of the
EL6 chondrites, and that no signiÔ¨Åcant partial melting occurs in the center of the body, such that no large changes in
the chemical and mineralogical composition of the material and no diÔ¨Äerentiation under the action of gravity need to
be considered.

We consider, however, that the initially chondrule-dominated granular material can be compacted at elevated tem-
perature and pressure within large parts of the body‚Äôs interior. The compaction by hot pressing needs to be considered
since it causes an increase of the heat conduction within the material by elimination of the initially considerable frac-
tion of voids in the granular material. It is also responsible for much of the structural changes of the material during the
course of the evolution of the chondritic material from petrologic type three to type six. Other processes responsible
for the equilibration of the material during its thermal evolution are of minor importance for the temperature evolution
and are not considered.

Parent body of EL chondrites

The local deformations by creep at high temperature, if active, deform at the same time an initially irregular shaped
body as a whole into a near-spherical shaped conÔ¨Åguration. This allows us to consider for simplicity a spherically
symmetric built-up body.

An important point in our model is the question if the duration of the growth process can be neglected or not.
According to our present understanding, the asteroids form within the accretion disk of the early proto-sun by agglom-
eration from tiny, sub-ùúám-sized dust grains to asteroidal sized bodies of the order of hundred to a few hundred kilome-
tres radius. In classical bottom-up accretion models of planetesimals (e.g. Weidenschilling, 1977), gravity-assisted
growth by >1 km sized planetesimals is fast. The problem of these ‚Äî likely obsolete ‚Äî classical models are a number
of barriers tested in the laboratory: the bouncing, the break-up, and the drift barrier (e.g., Morbidelli and Raymond,
2016). More recent models circumvent these problems by assuming that planetesimals are formed from clumps of solid
particles that reach densities high enough to become self-gravitating and contract to form the Ô¨Ånal bodies, a process
also favoured by a disk‚Äôs turbulence (Johansen et al., 2007; Cuzzi et al., 2008) and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
(Youdin and Goodman, 2005). This is the so-called streaming instability (Johansen et al., 2007, 2015a,b), and this
process is very fast. A further concept, called pebble accretion, is based on pebbles drifting inwards in the protoplan-
etary disk. These can be captured by planetesimals, causing their size growth to planetary embryos and even further
(Levison et al., 2015; Visser and Ormel, 2016; Klahr and Schreiber, 2020). During the initial formation stages bodies
are too small to be signiÔ¨Åcantly heated by decay of radioactives because the liberated heat is eÔ¨Éciently transported to
the surface and transferred to the accretion disk. During this phase the material of the just forming bodies is essentially
at the same temperature as the mid-plane temperature of the accretion disk. This is true as long as bodies are less than
c. km in size. Bodies of the order of hundred kilometres size, on the contrary, are too big for rapid energy-loss by heat
conduction and start to heat up. This means that in our models of thermal evolution, we have to consider the growth
in the size regime of signiÔ¨Åcantly bigger than km sized bodies.

Whether we consider gravity-assisted growth in the > 1 km regime, or scenarios based on streaming instabilities
or pebble accretion, all these concepts favour a rapid growth within the size regime in which internal heat is retained
eÔ¨Äectively. The growth process is particularly short compared to the decay time-scale of the most eÔ¨Écient heat sup-
plier, 26Al (half-life of 0.72 Myr). That is, the essential heating of the interior of such bodies occurs only if they have
already achieved almost their Ô¨Ånal size. Hence, we follow the common practice to apply the instantaneous formation
approximation where it is simply assumed that the body is suddenly formed at some birthtime, ùë°b, with some initial
temperature, ùëái (assumed to be constant across the body; heating by release of gravitational energy during growth
becomes important only for much bigger sized bodies). The initial temperature, ùëái, should equal the mid-plane tem-
perature of the accretion disk at the distance of the birthplace of the body from the proto-sun at the instant ùë°b. We will
also argue below in the discussion, that even if Ô¨Ånal layers are accreted up to 2 Myr after the birthtime, this will not
alter our conclusions, because this corresponds to 4 Myr after CAIs, a time when possible pebble Ô¨Çuxes have mostly
ceased (Klahr and Schreiber, 2020).

3.2. Equations for thermal evolution

The raise and fall of temperature within the body is described by the heat conduction equation which in case of

spherical symmetry is

ùúöùëêùëâ

ùúï ùëá
ùúï ùë°

= ‚àí

ùúï ùëü

ùëü2 ùêæ

ùúï ùëá
ùúï ùëü

+ ùúö‚Ñé .

(2)

Here ùëü is the distance from the centre, ùúö the mass density of the material, ùëêùëâ and ùêæ the heat capacity per unit mass and
the heat conductivity of the material, respectively, and ‚Ñé is the energy production rate by per unit mass of the material.

The chondritic material contains initially a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of voids. The density ùúö then is given by

ùúö = ùúöb (1 ‚àí ùúô) ,

(3)

where ùúöb is the density of the compact, void-free material and the porosity, ùúô, is the fraction of the volume allotted to
the empty space between the mineral and metal grains.

The heat conductivity, ùêæ, is strongly dependent on ùúô, typically like

ùêæ = ùêæb ùëì (ùúô) ,

(4)

where ùêæb is the bulk heat conductivity of the pore-free material (ùúô = 0) and some function ùëì (ùúô) which depends on
the pore-geometry (Henke et al., 2016). This is speciÔ¨Åed in Sect. A.3.

M. TrieloÔ¨Ä et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 5 of 28

The porosity, ùúô, changes with time under the action of the pressure, ùëÉ , acting on the material. The pressure loading

at each radius ùëü inside the body is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation

Parent body of EL chondrites

ùúï ùëü

= ‚àí

ùê∫ ùëÄ(ùëü) ùúö

,

where ùê∫ is the gravitational constant and ùëÄ(ùëü) is the mass contained within a sphere of radius ùëü.

The variation of the porosity is described by a diÔ¨Äerential equation

ùúï ùúô
ùúï ùë°

= ùêπ (ùúô, ùëÉ , ùëá ) .

(5)

(6)

The details are speciÔ¨Åed in Appendix A.6. The compaction process is strongly temperature dependent. There is prac-
tically no compaction below some characteristic temperature ùëácmp while compaction rapidly runs into completion at
somewhat higher temperature (cf. Appendix A5 of Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2019). Because of this, the initially homoge-
neously composed body develops a structure with a compacted (undiÔ¨Äerentiated) rock-like core outlining the region
where the peak temperature during the raise and fall of the temperature at some location inside the body exceeded the
temperature ùëácmp, and a sandstone-like porous mantle where the peak temperature always stayed below ùëácmp.

For solving the equations we use instead of the radius variable ùëü (varying between zero and the radius, ùëÖ, of the
body) a mass variable ùëö (varying between zero at ùëü = 0 and the total mass, ùëÄ, of the body at ùëü = ùëÖ). The radius, ùëü,
is calculated at each instant from

d ùëü
d ùëö

=

1
4ùúãùúöb(1 ‚àí ùúô)ùëü2

.

(7)

This automatically accounts for the shrinking of the body during compaction. The total mass of the body, ùëÄ, is
constant, the radius of the body, ùëÖ, varies with time while the material is compacted by the action of self-gravity and
elevated temperature. Hence, we have to discriminate between the actual radius, ùëÖ, and the pre-compaction radius,
ùëÖpr, at birthtime of the body. We prefer to characterize the body by its initial radius ùëÖpc.

3.3. Initial and surface temperature

It is necessary for the construction of an evolution model to specify the initial temperature and the surface temper-

ature during the period considered.

The initial temperature is not known and cannot uniquely be determined in our case. If suÔ¨Écient data for the
cooling history of meteorites are available, it can be determined from model Ô¨Åtting, as it was done for the case of the
H chondrite parent body by Henke et al. (2013). This requires in particular data for chondrites of low petrologic type
because their cooling history is strongly aÔ¨Äected by the value of the initial temperature. Because we have only data
for EL6 chondrites which suÔ¨Äered high peak temperatures and, thus, need to originate from large burial depths, this
procedure to Ô¨Åx the initial temperature can presently not be applied for the case of EL chondrites. Instead there is some
kind of degeneracy between the formation time of the body and its initial temperature (see Appendix A.5) in the sense
that an increase in initial temperature can be compensated by a certain increase of formation time without changing
the later thermal evolution. For this reason we assume the initial temperature to be a free parameter that is varied in
the range between between 200 K and 400 K.

With respect to the boundary temperature we remark the following: During the Ô¨Årst few million of years of evolution
of the body after its formation the body is still located within the dusty accretion disk of the proto-sun. Its surface
temperature, ùëás, is determined during this initial part of its evolution by radiative energy exchange with the disk and
by ventilation, and therefore is close to the temperature of the disk (and, thus, also to ùëái). After disk dissipation the
temperature at the surface of the body is mainly determined by heating due to illumination by the proto-sun and cooling
by radiation to space (the heat Ô¨Çux from the interior turns out to be small compared to the radiative terms and is of
negligible inÔ¨Çuence). This equilibrium temperature is shown in Fig. 2 at 5, 10, and 100 Myr after formation of the
sun, calculated for enstatite chondrite material with an albedo of 0.2 and using an evolution model for a 1 M‚äô-mass
star from D‚ÄôAntona and Mazzitelli (1994). This temperature is likely to be lower than the temperature ùëás at the surface
immediately after formation of the body (equal to the mid-plane temperature of the accretion disk out of which the
body formed). It is not really constant since the luminosity of the young sun is not constant, but its variation during
the crucial period of the thermal evolution extending from a few Myr to about 100 Myr after formation of the sun is
suÔ¨Éciently small as that it can be treated as constant. Inspection of Fig. 2 shows that a typical value for this temperature

Figure 2: Radial stratiÔ¨Åcation of the radiative equilibrium temperature of a body with the albedo of enstatite chondrites
at 5, 10 and 100 Myr evolution time of the young sun. The vertical gray bar indicates the distance range where the parent
bodies of the enstatite chondrites probably formed.

at the distance range where the parent bodies of E chondrites likely formed is 200 K, and this value will be used in our
model calculations.

A formation region at c. 1.7 to 2 AU would be compatible with the radial distance of the Hungaria asteroid family
that seems to be spectroscopically linked to the enstatite achondrite class of the aubrites (e.g., Binzel et al., 2014;
Lucas et al., 2019). These have a reduced mineralogy similar to enstatite chondrites, although they are not derived
from the same parent body (Zhang et al., 1996). Other studies suggest formation regions closer to the sun, based
on isotopic similarities to terrestrial values (e.g., Javoy et al., 2010; Dauphas, 2017). Hence, we consider a possible
formation region between 1 and 2 AU.

The lowering of the surface temperature due to disk dissipation is likely to have some inÔ¨Çuence on the temperature
history of meteorites of low petrologic type because these stem from shallow layers below the surface of the body. For
these, the temperatures only suÔ¨Äer a short initial excursion to elevated temperatures followed by rapid cooling within
the Ô¨Årst few million years which is strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by the surface temperature. For meteorites of high petrologic
types, however, which come from deeper layers where the temperature excursion to temperatures exceeding 1 000 K
lasts for several tens of Myr, the precise variation of the boundary temperature during the Ô¨Årst few Myr of thermal
evolution is only of minor importance for their thermal history. In the case of EL chondrites no meteorites of low
petrologic type suited to study their temperature history are presently known, only such of type EL6. This allows us
to assume for simplicity a constant value for the boundary temperature ùëás in our models.

3.4. Initial porosity

According to our present knowledge asteroids form by some process that assembles free Ô¨Çoating dust and chon-
drules from the accretion disk into planetesimals (see Johansen et al., 2014, 2015a; Birnstiel et al., 2016, for a review
on asteroid formation). The details of this process are not important for us, only the fact that initially the material is a
loosely packed bimodal granular medium consisting of about mm-sized granules and about ùúám sized dust. The growth
of bodies to the size of the parent bodies of meteorites involves according to presently discussed models low relative
velocities of ‚â≤ 1 km s‚àí1 which are much too low to shatter dust particles and chondrules. The initial structure of the
material from which the bodies are built is therefore assumed to be a granular material which to some extent may be
slightly compressed by the action of self-gravitation of the body and by collisions during its growth.

Information on the initial structure of the material is preserved in the meteorites of petrologic type three. During
the course of the chemical evolution of the parent body the initial porosity disappears by sintering. The porosity
found in petrologic type six meteorites (Britt and Consolmagno, 2003) is of a secondary nature resulting from action
of shocks, for instance during the excavation of the meteorites, or reÔ¨Çects weathering, if derived as modal porosity
(Britt and Consolmagno, 2003). This does not tell us anything about the initial structure of the material. In the case of
enstatite chondrites only very few type 3 chondrites are known. Weisberg et al. (2014) studied a number of EL3 and
EH3 chondrites and note that the matrix in two EL3 chondrites has low abundance and that, for instance, MAC 88136

appears to be matrix-free. The dusty rims of chondrules frequently seen in ordinary chondrites seem also to be absent
in enstatite chondrites (Krot et al., 2005). For EH3 chondrites the matrix abundance also is generally found to be low,
though in ALH 81189 a rather high fraction of 14 vol% is found (Weisberg et al., 2014; Rubin et al., 2009).

In enstatite chondrites we likely have to deal with an initial structure of the material corresponding to the ran-
dom packing of near-spherical chondrules from a very limited size range and mean diameter of ‚àº 0.5 ‚Ä¶ 0.6 mm
(Friedrich et al., 2015) with a small or nearly absent additional admixture of ùúám-sized dust particles. Without dust
and for mono-sized spherical chondrules the porosity of the granular material would be ùúô = 0.44 for the loosest closed
packing and ùúô = 0.36 for the random closed packing. Which type of packing is really encountered depends on the way
how asteroids assemble from their smallest building blocks and the involved relative speeds, which are not known. An
admixture of matrix of up to 15 vol% would change the porosity to about ùúô = 0.45 to ùúô = 0.25, respectively (Gail et al.,
2015). In principle, initial porosities between about ‚àº 0.40 and ‚àº 0.25 could be possible and are considered in our
calculations.

We assume in our model computations that initially the porosity is constant throughout the body. This assumption
is only relevant, however, for the outer layers of the body since the temperature inside the body reaches after ca. 1 Ma
such a level (‚â≥ 1 000 K) that the material becomes compacted. By this, any remembrance on the initial structure is
lost for that part of the body.

4. Optimised evolution model

The set of thermochronologic data of EL chondrites discussed in Section 2 is used to determine the radius ùëÖ,
the birth-time ùë°b, and other properties of a thermal evolution model which matches the thermochronological data as
close as possible. This requires that the parent body underwent a relatively undisturbed evolution without catastrophic
collision events with other bodies during the Ô¨Årst about 100 Ma evolution of the solar system, such that the onion-shell
model hypothesis applies. If this assumption is valid or not can only be judged a posteriori if the thermochronologic
data can consistently be interpreted within the frame of this model.

We selected for our purpose the Ô¨Åve meteorites and the two thermochronological sytems for each of them shown
in Table 2. This data set comprises the meteorites for which suÔ¨Éciently reliable closure time and closure temperature
data are available. The ten diÔ¨Äerent datapoints are opposed by seven unknown quantities: besides the Ô¨Åve burial depths
of the meteorites we have to determine the radius and birthtime of the body. This leaves us with three more data points
than variables. The available dataset is quite scarce but should suÔ¨Éce to Ô¨Ånd a meaningful Ô¨Åt between data and model.

4.1. The quality function

The method how we obtain a Ô¨Åt is the same as in Henke et al. (2013) and Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä (2019). It is done by
two inter-nested optimisations. First, for a model with given ùëÖ and ùë°b for each of the chondrites (ùëõ = 1, ‚Ä¶ , 5) a burial
depth ùëèùëõ is determined by a least square minimisation.

For this, we Ô¨Årst determine for each of the thermochronological systems (denoted by index ùëó) for which we have
closure time determinations for this meteorite the temperature ùëáùëõ,ùëó, which is the temperature of the model, ùëá (ùëü, ùë°), at
some depth ùëü = ùëèùëõ and at instant ùë° = ùë°closure,ùëó. That is the temperature of the model at the measured closure time. We

Figure 4: Variation of maximum central temperature during thermal evolution of an asteroid with radius ùëÖ and formation
time ùë°b of the body. Dashed lines correspond to the onset of melting of the major components of the enstatite chondrite
material (the tempatures are only rough estimates, see text). An initial temperature of 300 K and initial porosity of
Œ¶0 = 0.30 are assumed.

is what we obtain in the Ô¨Årst step of our optimisation procedure, if for given ùëÖ and ùë°b for each of the meteorites a
best-Ô¨Åt burial depth is determined. The range of radii, ùëÖ, is chosen here as the likely range of radii for meteoritic
parent bodies from 60 km to 260 km. Bodies smaller than about 60 km radius would cool too rapidly to be compatible
with the existence of a period of several million years with temperatures above 1 000 K as required by the existence of
meteorites of petrologic type six. Bodies bigger than about 260 km radius should once have been completely molten
and diÔ¨Äerentiated, which is not suggested by the properties of EL chondrites. The range of formation times considered
is chosen from 1.6 Ma to 2.4 Ma after formation of CAIs for analogous reasons.

The models are calculated for four diÔ¨Äerent values of the initial porosity Œ¶0 between the extreme cases Œ¶0 = 0.25
and Œ¶0 = 0.40, because Œ¶0 is not well constrained from properties of primitive meteorites. The Ô¨Ågure shows, that in
all cases the quality function ùúí 2 takes low values along a curved region in the ùëÖ-ùë°b plane. This results from the fact,
that of our meteoritic sample four of the Ô¨Åve meteorites have data only for I-Xe and Ar-Ar clocks while the Ô¨Åfth has
I-Xe and a Rb-Sr closure times, and that the I-Xe closure times of all of the meteorites are almost identical and of high
accuracy. These meteorites then must originate from almost identical burial depths within the parent body in order that
the temperature at their burial depths passes for all of them at almost the same time through the closure temperature of
the I-Xe thermochronometer. On the other hand, the closure times for the Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr thermochronometres have
rather large uncertainties such that the requirement with respect to the temperature evolution at the burial depth of the
meteorite to pass within the error-limits trough that data point can be met by a variety of ùëÖ-ùë°b combinations. The data
then do not strongly constrain a single ùëÖ-ùë°b combination that allows to match the meteoritic data but merely result in
a ùëÖ-ùë°b-relation for possible radii and birthtimes of the parent bodies.

This degeneracy of our data set can be somewhat reduced by giving the data of Khairpur a higher weight in the
quality function than for the other four meteorites because the closure temperature of the Rb-Sr clock is diÔ¨Äerent from
that of the Ar-Ar clock of the four other meteorites, such that the preponderance of the Ar-Ar clock in the available
data-set is somewhat alleviated. In the models in Fig. 3 we applied a weighting factor of three on the contribution ùúí 2
ùëõ
of Khairpur to ùúí 2.

Even if we proceed in this way, we do not see in Fig. 3 one single and well deÔ¨Åned minimum in the ùúí 2(ùëÖ, ùë°b)
surface that suggests a well deÔ¨Åned radius-birthtime combination for the parent body of the EL chondrites. What we
do have are a few rather shallow minima. For the two smaller initial porosities Œ¶0 = 0.25 and Œ¶0 = 0.30 the situation
looks slightly more favourable than for the higher values Œ¶0 = 0.35 and Œ¶0 = 0.40.

4.3. Temperature restrictions

Figure 4 shows the variation of the maximum of the central temperature attained during the evolution of the body.
This has to exceed the metamorphic temperature at which EL6 chondrites are equilibrated, because we have such
meteorites at our hands, while, on the other hand side, it has to stay below the limit temperature above which melting
of the interior region of the body would occur because there are no indications for large-scale melting of the parent
body of the EL chondrites.

The metamorphic temperatures corresponding to the diÔ¨Äerent petrologic types are not well known for the en-
statite chondrites (see, for example, Huss et al., 2006). The latest study of this problem seems to be the work of
Zhang and Sears (1996).

Their results for the metamorphic temperatures of EL6 chondrites are 800‚ó¶C to 1 000‚ó¶C for the KQEOT ther-
mometer. However, there remained the uncertainty, that the KQEOT thermometer was set by pre-parent body events
(e.g., chondrule formation, condensation). Other thermometers indicated lower temperatures, but were considered to
possibly reÔ¨Çect later closure during slow cooling rather than maximum metamorphic temperatures. On the other hand,
for EH6 chondrites, Zhang and Sears (1996) concluded 800‚ó¶C‚Äì1 000‚ó¶C as maximum metamorphic temperatures. A
minimum value of 800‚ó¶C for EL6 chondrites is also supported by the observation that all EL6 chondrites show well-
deÔ¨Åned I-Xe ages demonstrating that the closure temperature of 1 000 ¬± 100 K was considerably exceeded during
parent body metamorphism. Hence, we have to require that the maximum of the central temperature of the parent
body should exceed a lower limit of about ùëác,min = 1 200 K since the real EL6 chondrites probably originate not just
from the central region of the body but somewhere else between the centre and the surface where temperatures are less.
This requirement excludes models that correspond to minima in the ùúí 2-surface found for ùúí0 = 0.25 and ùúí0 = 0.30 at

With respect to melting we have to consider three diÔ¨Äerent major components in enstatite chondrites: enstatite,
plagioclase with about 15 mol% anorthite, and the Fe,Ni-FeS complex. The melting of these three components as
isolated substances starts with the onset of eutectic melting of FeS at a temperature of 1260 K (Fei et al., 1997). At
1370 K the binary solid solution plagioclase starts melting which extends up to 1600 K, and at 1830 K pure enstatite
melts. For the real mixture as found in enstatite chondrites the melting behaviour is more complex because a number
of minor components are present and the composition of the components changes by equilibration between the various
components. A laboratory investigation on melting of an EH chondrite is described in McCoy et al. (1999) which
shows that the basic features of the melting process for a chondrite are unchanged, except that the onset of melting of
enstatite is lowered to a temperature of ‚àº 1 750 K because of changes in composition during heating of the mixture
(McCoy et al., 1999). Melting temperatures for Na-rich plagioclase in meteorites could also vary depending on the
mineralogy of speciÔ¨Åc meteorite classes (e.g., Collinet and Grove, 2020). Also, the melting temperature of Fe,Ni-FeS
decreases with increasing Ni concentration.

Figure 4 shows as dotted lines for which radius-birthtime combination the maximum central temperature just equals
the temperature required for the onset of melting of the main three components of the enstatite mineral mixture. The
assumed temperatures are, however, to be considered rather as upper limits for the onset of melting. Since known EL6
chondrites do not show indications of enstatite melting we have to require that the maximum of the central temperature
during the thermal evolution of the body does not exceed a limit temperature of ùëác,max ‚àº 1 750 K. This requirement
excludes models with birthtimes signiÔ¨Åcantly earlier than 1.65 Ma. An inspection of Fig. 3 then shows us that models
with a high initial porosity Œ¶0 = 0.40 and Œ¶0 = 0.35 take a minimum of ùúí 2 for models with a too early birthtime
of the body so as to be compatible with the restriction for the maximum central temperature. Only the models with
initial porosities around the value of 0.30 seem to be compatible with that requirement. Enstatite chondrites also seem
to show no indications for extensive melting of plagioclase.

4.4. Best-Ô¨Åt model

The optimum Ô¨Åt of the available thermochronological data is determined by minimisation of ùúí 2 with respect to
the fundamental model parametres ùëÖ and ùë°b. Besides these two principally unknown parametres there are additional
parameters that determine the properties and evolution of the parent body but which are presently not known or for
which one can give only crude estimates, though they are in principle determined by the physics of the planetesimal
formation process and the properties of the accretion disk at the location and birthtime of the body. This holds for
instance for the initial and surface temperatures, ùëái and ùëás, respectively (cf. Sect. 3.3), or the initial porosity of the
granular material, Œ¶0. If suÔ¨Écient data material is available, as is the case for the H chondrites, it can be attempted
to Ô¨Åx them by including their value into the model optimisation process. For the EL chondrites our data-basis is very
small and in principle an attempt to constrain further parameters by model-Ô¨Åtting should be avoided. Nevertheless, we
check, which value of Œ¶0 is required for a good Ô¨Åt of the data by treating Œ¶0 as a free parameter that is determined by
the optimisation process.

In Fig. 3 (upper right panel) there are several local minima for birthtimes < 2.15 Ma. For each of these, we give the
model parameters and results in Table 3, assuming an initial temperature of 300 K. For our preferred model (B, plotted
in Fig. 5) we also varied the initial temperatures (250 and 350 K) to show the inÔ¨Çuence of this parameter. Although the
initial temperature could have possibly been higher, we demonstrate in the appendix (section A.5) that higher initial
temperature cause only slight shifts to later formation times, while other results remain virtually unaÔ¨Äected. For the
initial porosity, values between 0.25 and 0.4 were allowed and the allowed range for the radius ùëÖ and birthtime ùë°b is
as in Sect. 4.1. The optimisation was done by a genetic algorithm.

It can be veriÔ¨Åed from Table 3, that each of the local minima represents a viable solution for certain parameters
of birthtime, radius and porosity. Table 3 shows the results for initial radius ùëÖpc before compaction, Ô¨Ånal radius ùëÖ
after compaction, birthtime ùë°b, and initial porosity Œ¶0 for the best-Ô¨Åt models and the corresponding values, ùúí 2, of their
quality function. Also given are the peak central temperature of the body, the burial depths of the meteorites, and the
peak temperature reached at that location. The main period of size reduction from pre-compaction radius ùëÖpc fo Ô¨Ånal
radius ùëÖ occurs around 1.5 Ma after formation of the body.

For all the six models the Ô¨Åt quality ùúí 2 is acceptable. This means that it is not possible to decide on the basis of
the Ô¨Åt quality alone which one of the diÔ¨Äerent possible models reproduces the experimental data on the meteorites at
best and possibly represents the properties of their parent body.

Notably, the initial porosity for all models turns out to be very close to Œ¶0 = 0.30, a value which would be obtained

for a random closest packing of equal sized chondrules with a small admixture of much smaller matrix particles. This
result closely matches with the observation that primitive EL3 chondrites are mainly composed of chondrules and are
matrix-poor. The variation of the best-Ô¨Åt results for ùëác, ùëÖ, and ùë°b with the assumption on ùëái is small such that these
can be considered as almost independent of ùëái (see also appendix A.5).

The diÔ¨Äerence between the models of the local minima is mainly birthtime, ranging from 1.84 to 2.11 Ma after
CAIs. A later birthtime correlates with lower central and EL6 maximum temperatures, with a smaller parent body
radius and and with a deeper burial depth of the EL6 chondrites. While metamorphic temperature in all models
(1 100‚Äì1 200 K) can be reconciled with the ‚Äì quite rough ‚Äì estimates available for EL6 chondrites, the central core
peak temperature (1 220-1 520 K) allows incipient Fe,Ni-FeS eutectic melting in 2-3 cases and incipient plagioclase
melting in only 1-2 cases. For a body with composition corresponding to chondrite types H, L, and LL a central
temperature of 1 500 K would be above the liquidus of the silicate minerals in ordinary chondrites (ca. 1 430 K)
and the corresponding parent bodies would likely be diÔ¨Äerentiated. This is not the case, however, for a body of the
characteristics of the parent body model (E) because of the signiÔ¨Åcantly higher melting temperature of the nearly-pure
enstatite (‚â≥ 1 700 K).

It seems not possible to decide on the basis of the properties of the models which models could represent the
properties of the parent body of the EL chondrites. The only clear diÔ¨Äerence would be if EL chondrites from deeper
parts of the parent body would be available where maximum temperatures at their burial depths exceed the liquidus
temperature of plagioclase for the case that the models with higher central temperature apply. In that case the presence
or absence of indications for plagioclase melting would allow a decision between the models.

In fact, a few enstatite meteorites are described in the literature (Boesenberg et al., 2014; Uribe et al., 2016a,b)
which according to their composition seem to be related to EL chondrites and show indications of Fe,Ni-FeS melting
and incipient plagioclase melting, but without indications for signiÔ¨Åcant loss of melts. It is not quite clear whether the
observed melting is due to high temperatures at their primordial location during the thermal evolution of the parent
body or to impact heating of surface material. In case of Zak≈Çodzie a Al-Mg age of only 5.4 Ma after CAI formation was
derived by Sugiura and Fujiya (2008) and this was ascribed to early 26Al induced thermal metamorphism, while other
studies advocated early impact heating for this particular meteorite (e.g. Przylibski et al., 2005). In Boesenberg et al.
(2014) it is noted that the anomalous E chondrites studied by them compositionally are related to the EL chondrites
and texturally resemble primitive achondrites indicating thermal and not impact heating.

We take model (B) from Table 3 to show some properties of the best-Ô¨Åt models. Figure 5 demonstrates how

the model Ô¨Åts the meteoritic data. The temperature variation with time of model (B) at the burial depths of the Ô¨Åve
meteorites are shown as black lines, the temperature variation for a number of other depth‚Äôs as solid grey lines, and
the central temperature as dashed grey line. The closure times and the closure temperatures of the corresponding
thermochronometers are shown for the Ô¨Åve meteorites by diÔ¨Äerent symbols and the corresponding error-bars. The
ùëá (ùë°) curves at the burial depths of the meteorites closely match the meteoritic data points well within their error bars.
This shows that it is possible to consistently interpret the meteoritic data within the frame of the onion-shell model.

The upper panel of Fig. 6 shows in more detail how the quality function ùúí 2 varies (at given values Œ¶0 = 0.3 and
ùëái = 300 K) with radius ùëÖ and birthtime ùë°b of the body around the optimum values corresponding to model (B). This
shows that for each local minimum there is only a rather narrow time-window of about 0.02 Ma for the possible value
of the birthtime of the parent body in order that the resulting thermal evolution model is consistent with the observed
cooling history of our set of EL chondrites. However, the possible variation over all local minima is larger, c. ¬±0.08
Ma, corresponding to precisions of some short-lived nuclide chronometries. The radius of the parent body is much less
restricted. A variation by up to 20 km seems to be possible within local minima, and ¬±20 km for all models (Table 3)
involving only minor partial melting.

The lower panel of Fig. 6 shows the variation of the quality function ùúí 2 with assumed initial temperature ùëái and
porosity Œ¶0 for models with a radius and birthtime corresponding to model (B). This demonstrates in more detail what
we noticed already above: The models only weakly depend on the precise value of the initial temperature, but the Ô¨Åt
quality depends signiÔ¨Åcantly on the initial porosities and Ô¨Åxes this to a value of appproximately Œ¶0 = 0.3 ¬± 0.05, a
value, that is also expected on physical grounds.

Figure 7 shows for the case of model (B) the peak temperature to which the material was heated at radius ùëü during
the Ô¨Årst three Gyr of thermal evolution of the body. For comparison the temperatures are indicated for onset of melting

of the major components of the enstatite chondrite material (enstatite, plagioclase, Fe-Ni and FeS) and the temperature
range over which compaction of the granular material from the initial value Œ¶0 = 0.3 to a value of Œ¶ = 0.05 (closure
of pore space) occurred.

Because of the relatively high activation energy for deformation creep in enstatite the compaction occurs at sig-
niÔ¨Åcantly higher temperatures as for H and L chondrites (1 150 K vs. 1 000 K). In the model our EL6 meteorites are
located within the layer where the loss of void space and the transition to a strongly solidiÔ¨Åcated material occurs. In
this respect our model result for compaction is consistent with the compacted structure typical for petrologic type six.
According to the model, the peak temperature suÔ¨Äered by the material of the EL6 chondrites during thermal evolu-
tion does not exceed the temperature of eutectic melting of the Ni,Fe-FeS sytem as estimated for the average composi-
tion of the nickel-iron alloy in EL chondrites, or the melting temperature of plagioclase. Under these circumstances no
melting would be observed. This is consistent with a lack of observations of noticeable melting in the EL6 chondrites.
Incipient melting, also of plagioclase, as is characteristic for primitive achondrites would be observed in models C,
D, and E if meteorites originating from deeper burial depths (e.g. > 25 km in our model E) on the parent body would
be found (which possibly already happened Boesenberg et al., 2014). No diÔ¨Äerentiation into a metallic iron core and
a silicate mantle would occur for the parent body within the frame of our model. The central temperature stays below
the melting temperature of silicate such that no large-scale separation of silicate and iron melt is possible.

5. Discussion

The comparison of our model with thermochronological data shows that solutions can be found that satisfactorily
describe the thermal evolution of the EL chondrite parent body. In the following, we will discuss some implications
and the validity of of our model asumptions and results, e.g., the validity of the asumption of instantaneous accretion,
the EL parent body accretion age, its size, possible melting in the interior, and some implications of the nearly identical
thermal history of various EL6 chondrites considered in this study.

5.1. Validity of the asumption of instantaneous accretion

Although it is clear that the initial stages of planetesimal growth are fast (see section 3.3) when compared to decay
time scales of 26Al, the most important heating nuclide, Ô¨Ånal stages of accretion may have been delayed. As the layering
depths of the EL6 chondrites are relatively shallow, our model of thermal evolution assuming instantaneous accretion
requires some discussion. In our models (Table 3 - without model (E) allowing incipient plagioclase melting) the burial
depths of EL6 chondrites are 15‚Äì20 km. It is important to note that maximum metamorphic temperatures (producing
type 6 material) are mainly governed by accretion time, while the style of cooling (constrained by geochronological
data) is determined mainly by layering depth. To be more exactly, ‚Äúlayering depth‚Äù means ‚ÄúÔ¨Ånal layering depth after

M. TrieloÔ¨Ä et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 15 of 28

 
 
Parent body of EL chondrites

nearly complete release of decay heat‚Äù. This means, the layering depths in our model can be varied in a way that growth
of the upper kilometre sized surface layers may have lasted up to 2 Myr longer, because 26Al decay heat needs 2‚Äì3 half-
lifes to be released completely in the major (interior) mass of the body. Hence, the precursor material may have been
layered more shallow in the beginning, however, reaching the peak metamorphic temperature of type 6 and cooling
according to chronological data requires 15‚Äì20 km layering depths only c. 5 Ma after CAIs. This can be deduced from
our Fig. 5, which shows that the onset of cooling does not start before c. 5 Ma after CAIs for type 6 material. This time
is, however, close to the disk dissipation age (Haisch et al., 2001; Pfalzner et al., 2015), so signiÔ¨Åcant pebble Ô¨Çuxes to
feed asteroidal-sized bodies seem unlikely to occur (Klahr and Schreiber, 2020). Another line of evidence is deduced
from various models for the H chondrite parent body. In this case, there are exceptionally high-quality chronological
data constraining its thermal evolution, that also point at nearly instantaneous accretion within < 1 Ma (Henke et al.,
2013; Monnereau et al., 2013). Particularly, these data comprise near surface sited low petrologic types (type 4) which
are derived from burial depths as low as 5‚Äì7 km (Henke et al., 2013), and contain metamorphic minerals with 26Mg
excess from in situ 26Al decay. Together with the Pb-Pb, Ar‚ÄìAr and 244Pu Ô¨Åssion track cooling ages (TrieloÔ¨Ä et al.,
2003), this requires both fast accretion and fast cooling of the outer shell (within a few Ma) and is not in favor of a
protracted accretion scenario.

5.2. Accretion age of the EL chondrite parent body

The range of accretion age of our EL chondrite parent body of 1.8‚Äì2.1 Ma after CAIs is comparable with other
- H and L - chondrite parent bodies (Henke et al., 2013; Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2019). In the case of the L chondrites
(Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2019), individual chondrule ages were used to set an upper age limit on parent body accretion as
chondrules must have formed via Ô¨Çash heating events before incorporation into their respective parent bodies. However,
this requires high precision age dating of excellently preserved chondrules which have not been thermally disturbed
during parent body heating. Such chondrules can only be found in the lowest petrologic types as, e.g., reported by
Pape et al. (2019). In the case of EL chondrites, low petrologic types are rare, and so are chondrule age data. Zhu et al.
(2020) found an age of 4565.7 ¬± 0.7 Ma for enstatite chondrite chondrule formation, corresponding to 1.6 ¬± 0.7 Myr
after CAIs. This can easily be reconciled with a parent body formation age of 1.8‚Äì2.1 Ma after CAIs.

5.3. EL chondrite parent body size

Our best Ô¨Åt models without plagioclase melting yield (Ô¨Ånal) parent body radii of 120‚Äì160 km, comparable to the
H or L chondrite parent bodies. Previous estimates of the size of enstatite chondrite parent bodies were based on
the total cooling time interval deÔ¨Åned by type 6 chondrites. Bogard et al. (2010) argued that H6 ordinary chondrites
record younger Ar-Ar cooling ages and accordingly longer cooling than enstatite type 6 chondrites, implying a possibly
smaller E chondrite parent body. However, detailed parent body modelling demonstrates that asteroids cool shell by
shell from the exterior, i.e., some shallow layered material may reach metamorphic temperatures nearly as high as the
centre, but cools much more rapidly. In the case of ordinary chondrites, modelling yields layering depths for type
H6 chondrites between 18 and 40 km in a ùëÖ = 160‚Äì200 km body (e.g., Henke et al., 2013, 2016), meaning that
some H6 chondrites record cooling at higher burial depths, but not necessarily in a larger parent body. In contrast,
the EL6 chondrites modelled here record the younger Ar-Ar ages due to shallow layering in c. 15‚Äì20 km depth in a
ùëÖ = 120‚Äì160 km body. As noted already by Hopp et al. (2014), the old EL6 Ar-Ar ages are either due ‚Äúto a smaller
parent body of EL chondrites relative to the H chondrite parent body, or alternatively, to a shallower sampling depth
of the meteorites‚Äù. Our modeling suggests that likely the latter is the case, although a smaller body size is likely for
models that do not allow incipient plagioclase melting. Relatively shallow layering of EL6 chondrites also implies that
the EL3, 4, 5 shells are conÔ¨Åned to quite thin surface layers. This in turn could also partly explain the scarcity of these
petrologic types.

As a Ô¨Ånal cautionary remark, we think that constraints on parent body size provided from samples by a range of

layering depths ‚Äî as in the H and L chondrite asteroids ‚Äî represent stronger constraints than for the EL case.

5.4. Partial melting in the interior

Among our models listed in Table 3, only few would allow incipient melting of Fe,Ni-FeS or plagioclase in the
central parent body region. Indeed, there is hardly evidence for partial melting, not to mention melt migration in the
case of EL chondrites. In the EL meteorite collections we know petrologic types ranging from 3 to 6, with a dominance
of type 6. There are no achondritic meteorites of EL characteristics. While diÔ¨Äerentiated enstatite chondrites exist (e.g.
aubrites or Shallowater) a common origin from the EL parent body was excluded (e.g., Keil, 1989). Only few enstatite

Parent body of EL chondrites

meteorites with incipient melting (but no melt loss) are possibly related to EL chondrites (Boesenberg et al., 2014;
Uribe et al., 2016a,b), e.g., Zak≈Çodzie. However, it is not clear, if its genesis is associated with strong metamorphic
heating or impact metamorphism. Its old Al-Mg age of 5.4 Ma after CAIs, seems incompatible with a time temperature
path experiencing > 1 400 K and cooling to the Al-Mg closure soon afterwards. Hence, if Zak≈Çodzie at all was
related to the EL parent body, only impact excavation could explain its high heating degree and rapid cooling (e.g.,
Przylibski et al., 2005).

5.5. Collisional evolution

In general, thermochronological data are more limited than in other favorable cases, e.g. the H chondrite asteroid
(Henke et al., 2013, 2016) or the Acapulcoite-Lodranite (A-L) parent body (Neumann et al., 2018), where up to 4
chronometers are available for a signiÔ¨Åcant number of individual meteorites. Another factor limiting the modeling
approach is the similarity of chronological data among the EL chondrite samples, as only for EL chondrites of petrologic
type 6 reasonable data are available, which obviously stem from a limited depth range in their parent body. Layering
depths vary only by < 1 km for the Ô¨Åve modelled EL6 chondrites (Table 3), and stem from somewhat shallow layers,
consistent with estimates by Zhang et al. (1996).

A similar situation was found for the Acapulcoite- Lodranite parent body, for which modeled layering depths
of acapulcoites were essentially indistinguishable, while lodranites obviously stem from only c. 3 km deeper shells
(Neumann et al., 2018). This contrasts with various H chondrites of diÔ¨Äerent petrologic types which were modelled to
stem from depths varying by many tens of km (Henke et al., 2013, 2016). The question is why in some cases (EL and
A-L meteorites) sampling seems to be restricted to a limited range of layering depths.

A possible reason is linked to the mechanism how small meteorites are sampled from initially large parental aster-
oids. Meteoroids have to be excavated from their parent bodies by collisions, and Monte Carlo simulations (Turner,
1979) indicate that typically several collisions are involved from fragmenting initially large asteroids to fragments of
(observable) asteroid families, and Ô¨Ånally to meter-sized meteoroids. Cosmic ray exposure ages demonstrate that the
excavation of typical meter-sized meteoroids (later impacting on Earth) occurred no longer than a few tens of millions
of years ago for stony meteorites. Hence, it is not astonishing that meteorite Ô¨Çuxes maybe dominated by a small re-
stricted region of their initially larger parent bodies. From these comparatively small objects, several or maybe only
few impacts may excavate meteorites which dominate the Ô¨Çux of this speciÔ¨Åc class to Earth.

Such a scenario is supported by the clustering of cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages of acapulcoites and lodranites.
CRE ages are indistinguishable at 5 ¬± 1 Ma (Eugster and Lorenzetti, 2005), indicating that possibly only one impact
excavated most acapulcoites and lodranites from a c. 3 km sized fragment of the initially much larger A-L asteroid
(Neumann et al., 2018). For the H chondrites CRE ages range up to 80 Ma indicating that continuous impact events
excavated meteoroids from several fragments or rubble pile asteroids consisting of diÔ¨Äerent fragments representing a
wide layering depth of the initial H chondrite asteroid.

In the case of EL6 chondrites, an origin from a small, < 1 km sized Apollo asteroid ‚Äì or an impact region of such size
on a larger asteroid ‚Äì seems feasible. The CRE age distribution of the EL6 chondrites studied here (BlithÔ¨Åeld: 30 ¬± 5
Ma; Khairpur: 37¬±5 Ma; Daniel‚Äôs Kuil: 33¬±5 Ma (Crabb and Anders, 1981, and references therein) ; Neuschwanstein:
47 Ma (Zipfel et al., 2010); LON94100: 31 ¬± 2 (Patzer and Schultz, 2001) has four members compatible with a 33
Ma age, quite similar to the majority of EL6 CRE ages that cluster between 20 and 35 Ma (Patzer and Schultz, 2001)).
Although not as compelling as in the case of A-L meteorites, this may indicate excavation from a relatively small
parent body fragment by a single low grade impact event. The occurrence of other petrologic types in the fall statistics
of enstatite chondrites maybe explained by stemming from other small fragments of the EL parent asteroid.

It should be noted here that the eventual impacts excavating meter-sized meteoroids from parent body fragments
are usually low energetic impacts that are not capable of resetting radioisotope chronometers. This can be deduced
from many observations that CRE ages (deÔ¨Åned by nuclides accumulating by cosmic ray interactions) are always much
younger than radioisotopic ages set by thermal events exceeding respective closure temperatures. While most CRE
ages of stony meteorites do not exceed 100 Ma, most radioisotopic ages are related to parent body metamorphism
in the early solar system c. 4.5 Ga ago (e.g., TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2009). Occasionally, highly energetic impact events can be
recorded, however, mostly by chronometers with low closure temperatures. For example, many U/Th‚ÄìHe and Ar-Ar
ages indicate a major catastrophic collision on the L chondrite parent body 470 Ma ago (Korochantseva et al., 2007).
However, such events set by asteroid collisions are usually accompanied by signiÔ¨Åcant shock metamorphism, leaving
typical signatures in meteorites like conversion of plagioclase to maskelynite, production of localised melt veins and
pockets, and transformation of minerals to high-pressure polymorphs (StoeÔ¨Ñer et al., 1991). In studies aiming at the

chronology of early parent body cooling, shock-metamorphosed samples are avoided, usually only samples with low
shock stages 1 or 2 are considered (e.g., TrieloÔ¨Ä et al., 2003). While the eÔ¨Äects of impact metamorphism can be safely
identiÔ¨Åed in cases of localised melt veins and pockets, problems may occur in case of ascribing more global melting
phenomena to either internal parent body heating or to external impact heating by large impacts, e.g. such as in the
case of the primitive enstatite achondrite Zak≈Çodzie (see above).

5.6. Implications for the EH chondrite parent body

A similar modelling study for the EH chondrite parent body is much more complicated or even impossible due
to the scarcity of chronological data resulting from parent body cooling. For example, low temperature chronometers
frequently show secondary disturbances or complete reset by impact metamorphism, e.g., a < 1 Gyr Ar-Ar age for
EH4 Bethune (Bogard et al., 2010), or Rb-Sr ages for EH3 Qingzhen of 2.12 ¬± 0.23 Gyr and for EH3 Yamato 06901
of 2.05 ¬± 0.33 Gyr (Torigoye and Shima, 1993).

High temperature chronometer are more likely to record the early parent body cooling history. In the case of the
I-Xe chronometer, we indeed have a remarkable coherence of ages of four EH Chondrites (EH4 Abee and Indarch,
EH4/5 EET96135 and EH5 St. Marks) which are all ca. 4 Ma older than the EL6 chondrites (Hopp et al., 2016;
Kennedy et al., 1988; BusÔ¨Åeld et al., 2008) indicating I-Xe closure only 6 Ma after CAIs. Other constraints can be
obtained from the fact that for EH chondrites there is a preponderance of low petrologic types but nevertheless few
type 6 are known. A maximum metamorphic temperature of type 6 constrains the formation time to similar values as
the EL chondrite parent body, i.e. 2.0-2.1 Myr after CAIs. Such a formation time would be compatible with the EH
chondrule age of 1.6 ¬± 0.7 Myr after CAIs by Zhu et al. (2020). I-Xe closure (at 1000 K) c. 4 Myr earlier than EL6
types could be achieved in a layering depth of 15 km (compare Fig. 5), implying a maximum metamorphic temperature
c. 100 K lower than type 6.

In contrast the size of the parent body can only be deduced from the cooling curve shape, e.g., a steep cooling curve
implies lower radii, a shallower cooling curve larger radii. Hence, the EH parent body size can only be constrained by
an undisturbed cooling age of a low temperature chronometer like Ar-Ar, which seems presently unavailable and must
await future studies of samples undisturbed by secondary impact metamorphism.

6. Concluding remarks

We attempted to reconstruct the parent body of the group of enstatite chondrites with low iron content (type EL).
This is done by comparing information on the cooling history of individual EL meteorites provided by Ar-Ar and I-Xe
ages of meteorites with model calculations for the internal constitution and thermal evolution of big planetesimals with
material properties characteristic for enstatite chondrites.

We use for this comparison chronological data previously determined by us (Hopp et al., 2014, 2016) and other
studies (Kennedy, 1981; Kennedy et al., 1988; BusÔ¨Åeld et al., 2008; Bogard et al., 2010) and selected meteorites for
which at least two reliable such age determinations exist for thermochronological systems with diÔ¨Äerent closure tem-
peratures. We additionally determined the frequency factor and activation energy for Xe-diÔ¨Äusion in the enstatite host
material to determine the closure temperature of the I-Xe system. Because of the relative rarity of E chondrites there
are only Ô¨Åve meteorites (LON 94100, Neuschwanstein, Khairpur, BlithÔ¨Åeld, Daniel‚Äôs Kuil) with data useful for our
purposes, all of petrologic type six. This is far less than for the much better studied H chondrites and unfortunately
covers only a limited range of peak metamorphic temperatures. This number is just suÔ¨Écient to pin down the two most
important parameters of the parent body, its radius and its formation time, by Ô¨Åtting models for the internal constitution
and evolution of small bodies from the asteroid belt to the meteoritic record.

The model calculations follow closely the methods applied in our previous work on H chondrites (Henke et al.,
2012b, 2013; Gail et al., 2015; Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2018), L chondrites (Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2019), and Acapulcoites and
Lodranites (Neumann et al., 2018). Based on the assumption of a spherically symmetric body that is heated by decay of
long and short lived radioactives, in particular by 26Al, and formed on a timescale short compared to the initial heating
period, we solved the heat conduction equation coupled with equations for the compaction of the initially chondrule-
dominated material, considering the temperature and porosity dependence of heat conductivity and the temperature
dependence of heat capacity.

By varying the radius, the formation time (after CAI formation), and the initial porosity of the material we deter-
mined the parameter combination which Ô¨Åtted the thermochronological data as well as possible. Probably because of
the restricted number of meteorites to compare with, more than one solution is possible. Two models are consistent

depths of 17 and 20 km, and peak temperatures of 1 100 K and 1 120 K. Two more models (1.93 and 1.84 Ma after
CAIs) allow incipient to minor plagioclase melting (but no melt migration) and could apply if recently identiÔ¨Åed en-
statite chondrites with properties resembling primitive achondrites were derived from the EL chondrite parent body.
The parent body radius imposed by our models is less well constrained varying between 120 and 210 km, however,
the initial porosity is close to 30% in all cases. The initial temperature is only weakly restricted by the model Ô¨Åts, but
a range between about 250 K and 350 K is suggested.

A. Material properties

For modelling the thermal evolution of an asteroid we require information on a number of properties of its mate-
rial: the heat capacity, ùëêùëâ , heat conductivity, ùêæ, heating rate, ‚Ñé, and deformation properties during sintering. In the
following we describe how these data are determined.

A.1. Composition

The properties of the material are determined by its chemical and mineralogical composition which can be derived
from the analyses of the composition of the enstatite meteorites. The enstatite chondrites consist of a granular material
composed of a complex mixture of about 0.1 to 1 mm sized roundish chondrules composed themselves of a mixture
of enstatite and some less-abundant Al-Ca-Na-silicate minerals, and a small fraction of matrix material consisting of
ùúám-sized dust grains (if ever) and some fraction of metallic iron and iron-sulphide grains Ô¨Ålling the voids between
chondrules.

Average values for the mole fractions of the components in EH meteorites are estimated from data given in
Zipfel et al. (2010); Weisberg and Kimura (2012) and Van Schmus (1969). Our model data are listed in Table 4. These
data are based on data referring to EL meteorites of low and high petrologic types and therefore represent some kind
of average composition with respect to the main components for all petrologic types. In fact, there are compositional
diÔ¨Äerences between primitive and highly equilibrated meteorites with respect to minor components in the mixture, but
this would cause only minor changes in the material properties if considered. The bulk density

calculated for this composition is ùúöb = 3.63 g cm‚àí3, while for comparison Friedrich et al. (2015) gives measured values
for ùúö of 3.48 ¬± 0.18 for Hvittis and 3.62 ¬± 0.01 for Pillistfer.

A.2. Heat capacity

The heat capacity and conductivity could in principle be measured directly from meteoritic specimens, but in case
of EL chondrites such data seem not to be available. We therefore have to estimate the relevant data from laboratory
measured data for the constituents of the chondritic material. The heat capacity per unit mass for the mixture of
minerals and iron encountered in enstatite chondrites is calculated as

ùëêùëâ =

ùëãùëñùëêùëâ ,ùëñ .

‚àëùëñ

(11)

from laboratory measured heat capacities ùëêùëù,ùëñ per unit mass of the mixture components (we neglect the small diÔ¨Äerence
between ùëêùëù and ùëêùëâ of solids) and their mass-fractions ùëãùëñ in the mixture. We consider only the most abundant compo-
nents and an average composition of those components which are solid solutions as speciÔ¨Åed in Table 4. Details are
described in Henke et al. (2012a).

Figure 8 shows the resulting temperature variation of the calculated speciÔ¨Åc heat, ùëêùëâ , for EL chondrites. No
experimentally determined data seem to be available which can be compared to our model data to check the accuracy
of the approach. The values cited in Soini et al. (2020) and in (Opeil et al., 2012) as taken from Yomogida and Matsui
(1983) seem, in fact, to be theoretical estimates because Yomogida and Matsui (1983) does not contain data on enstatite
chondrites. A laboratory measured value given in Rudee and Herndon (1981) seems be either erroneous because it
is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than for the pure substances in the mixture, or their specimen had an untypical composition.
Since the speciÔ¨Åc heats of H and L chondrites calculated by the same method compare well with laboratory data
(Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2019) we believe that our results for enstatite chondrites are also reliable.

A.3. Heat conductivity

Measured data presently seem to be only available for the heat conductivity of the EL6 meteorite Phllistfer studied
by Opeil et al. (2012). This measurement is limited, however, to the low temperature regime ùëá < 340 K which does
not cover the important high-temperature range up to at least 1 400 K relevant for thermal models of meteorite parent
bodies. Hence we have to determine the heat conductivity from a theoretical model for the mineral mixture of enstatite
chondrites.

The heat conductivity depends on the mineralogical composition of the chondritic material and additionally it
depends strongly on the porosity of the material because any void represents an obstacle for heat Ô¨Çow.
It can be
described by the heat conductivity of the bulk material, ùêæb, and a correction factor, ùëì (ùúô), accounting for the reduction
of the conductivity due to the presence of pores as in Eq. (4).

First we consider the bulk heat conductivity ùêæb and its temperature variation. It is calculated by the model described

in Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä (2018) for matter with the average composition given in Table 4. The result is shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 9: Temperature variation of the bulk heat conductivity ùêæ for the composite material in EL chondrites (black solid
line), and for porous material with porosities ùúô = 0.25 (red solid line) and ùúô = 0.35 (blue solid line). For comparison also
the bulk heat conductivity of H chondrite material is shown (short dashed black line).

A comparison of this with real enstatite chondrite material is hampered for two reasons. First, measured heat
conductivity data are available only for the two enstatites Abee (EH6) and Pillistfer (EL6) in the temperature range
ùëá < 340 K. Second, experimental data for the heat conductivity for the components of the chondritic material (with
the exception of iron) could only be found for the temperature range ùëá ‚â≥ 300 K. For this reason a comparison of our
heat conductivity model with laboratory masurements is presently only possible for the temperature range around 300
K.

In Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä (2018) the temperature variation of the components were approximated for the whole tem-
perature range 0 < ùëá < 1500 K by the model of Callaway (1959) which allowed a good approximations of the heat
conductivities of H, L, and LL chondrite material. For the two enstatite chondrites, however, the model derived for the
temperature dependence of ùêæ for the mineral enstatite in Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä (2018, 2019) matches the heat conductivi-
ties of the two enstatite chondrites at low temperatures ùëá ‚â≤ 100 K not particular well (cf. Fig. 6 in Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä,
2018). This likely results from a lack of data for very low temperatures which forced us in particular to use a rather
crude approximation for the Debye temperature. Fortunately, the temperature range ùëá ‚â≤ 200 K is not relevant for
thermal evolution modelling of the enstatite chondrite parent body. In the important temperature range ùëá ‚â≥ 300 K
on the other hand, our heat conductivity model for enstatite reproduces the available experimental data (cf. Fig. 2 in
Gail and TrieloÔ¨Ä, 2018) at ùëá ‚â• 300 K reasonably well.

Second, we consider the correction factor ùëì (ùúô) accounting for the presence of pores. For this we use in our model

calculations the approximation (Henke et al., 2016, 2012a)

ùëì1(ùúô) = ùëöùëéùë• ( 1 ‚àí 2.216 ùúô, 0 )
ùëì2(ùúô) = e1.2‚àíùúô‚àï0.167

This joins smoothly an approximation ùëì1(ùúô) applicable for porosities ùúô ‚â≤ 0.35 with an approximation ùëì2(ùúô) for
porosities ùúô ‚â≥ 0.45.

We note that our model fairly reproduces the measured value at 300 K for Pillistfer. The experimental value for
Philistfer at 300 K is ùêæ = 5.14 W m‚àí1K‚àí1 (Opeil et al., 2012), while for our model we obtain ùêæb = 5.59 W m‚àí1K‚àí1.
The eÔ¨Äective heat conductivity is essentially determined by that of the enstatite component (ùêæb = 5.07 W m‚àí1K‚àí1)
because of its high abundance and by the nickel-iron component (ùêæb = 33.8 W m‚àí1K‚àí1) because of the high heat
conductivity of metals. If we consider that the measured porosity of Pilistfer is ùúô ‚àº 0.03 (Macke et al., 2010) we
obtain with Eqs. (12) and (4) a value of ùêæ = 5.22 W m‚àí1K‚àí1 in reasonable agreement with the experimental Ô¨Ånding.

A.4. Energy production

Heat production within the body is assumed to be dominated by the decay of radioactive nuclei. The heating rate

per unit mass is

‚Ñé =

ùëãùëñùëìùëñùê∏ùëñùúèùëñ e‚àíùë°‚àïùúèùëñ ,

‚àëùëñ

(15)

where the sum is over all isotopes, labelled with index ùëñ, contributing signiÔ¨Åcantly to the overall heat production. Here,
ùëãùëñ denotes the mass fraction of the corresponding element, ùëìùëñ the fractional abundance of the radioactive isotope at
the time of formation of the solar system, ùê∏ùëñ the energy released by the decay of that nucleus to its stable end-product,
ùúèùëñ the average lifetime of the radioactive nucleus, and ùë° is the time elapsed since solar system formation.

The most important nuclei for internal heating of the body are 26Al, 40K, and 60Fe. Values for ùëìùëñ, ùê∏ùëñ, and ùúèùëñ are
given in Table 4 of Henke et al. (2012a). The mass-fractions ùëãùëñ of the elements are set to the average mass fractions in
EL chondrites as given in Table 3 of Hoppe (2009); they agree reasonably with the values given for Neuschwanstein
in Zipfel et al. (2010). For the abundance of 60Fe we use the value given in Tang and Dauphas (2012) which seems
also to apply for EL chondrites. At this small level of abundance of 60Fe, its contribution to heating is unimportant.

It is assumed that the initial distribution of the heat sources within the body is homogeneous and that they are not

later re-distributed by, for instance, diÔ¨Äerentiation.

A.5. Model dependence on initial temperature

During the initial Ô¨Årst 105 years during the evolution of asteroids with at least ‚â≥ 100 km radius, the radial temper-
ature proÔ¨Åle is rather Ô¨Çat. The characteristic timescale for temperature changes by heat conduction is ùúè = ùúÖ‚àïùëë2 for a
layer of thickness ùëë and heat diÔ¨Äusivity ùúÖ = ùêæ‚àï(ùúöùëêùëù). This amounts to ca. 5 √ó 106 yrs for ùëë = 10 km and a typical dif-
fusivity ùúÖ of 5 √ó 10‚àí7 (see Figs. 9 and 8 and Table 4). During the initial heating phase, the spatial temperature-increase
from the outer boundary temperature to the actual inner temperature caused by 26Al decay is limited to a layer of a
few km thickness (see Fig 10 for an example) . As a consequence, from two bodies with otherwise identical properties
formed at instants ùë°1 < ùë°2 with initial temperatures ùëá1 < ùëá2, body 1 has reached just temperature ùëá2 at instant ùë°2 if the

Parent body of EL chondrites

diÔ¨Äerences of the total heat contents of the body corresponding to the temperature diÔ¨Äerence equals the heat release
by 26Al during the period from ùë°1 to ùë°2:

ùëá2

ùë°1

ùë°2

ùúö‚Ñé dùë° dùëâ .

(16)

(The integration over ùëâ is over the volume of the body.) From that point on, body number one takes the same thermal
evolution as body number two. Hence, diÔ¨Äerent initial temperatures of otherwise identical bodies are equivalent to a
shift in formation time, at least approximately, if they show the same properties at later times.

A.6. Sintering

Sintering is modelled by the approach described in Gail et al. (2015, cf.

the references therein for the papers
from which this model is adapted). Only sintering by power-law creep is considered because matrix material has low
abundance and creep dominates for the relatively big chondrules.

The equations for sintering are more conveniently written in the variable

ùê∑ = 1 ‚àí ùúô

(17)

which is the so called Ô¨Ålling factor. This variable is used in what follows. The initial Ô¨Ålling factor of the granular
chondritic material is ùê∑0. The compaction has to be treated somewhat diÔ¨Äerently for the initial stage where the pore-
space is still interconnected, and the Ô¨Ånal stage where the pore network is closed. The transition between both cases
occurs at a Ô¨Ålling factor ùê∑cl.

The sintering is caused by an eÔ¨Äective pressure acting between the contact areas of the chondrules. During the

initial stage (ùê∑0 ‚â§ ùê∑ ‚â§ ùê∑cl) this is given by

the pores at the moment of the closure of the pore network, and ùê∫ is the average radius of the granular units (the
chondrules).

The speciÔ¨Åc material properties are described in this approach by ùê¥, ùëõ, and ùëÑ, which have to be determined from
laboratory measurements. For enstatite chondrites sintering occurs under dry conditions. This is important because

the activation energy for creep depends strongly on the oxygen fugacity and is the higher the dryer the conditions in
the system are. Because of the long timescales for heating in asteroidal bodies sintering occurs in such bodies at rather
low temperatures, typical ‚àº 1 000 K, which fall into the stability Ô¨Åeld of orthoenstatite (cf. Fig. 1 in Bystricky et al.,
2016).

Creep deformation of (nearly) pure ortho-enstatite at diÔ¨Äerent oxygen fugacities was studied in the laboratory.
Overviews on the available data on diÔ¨Äerent materials of interest in particular for geophysical problems, but also
required for modeling of asteroids, are given, e.g., by (B√ºrgmann and Dresen, 2008) and Karato (2013). Two more
recent studies dealing with ortho-enstatite are Bystricky et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2020), from which the second
studied deformation under ‚Äúwet‚Äù and ‚Äúdry‚Äù conditions for which the hydrogen content of the samples were explicitly
determined. The hydrogen content of enstatite chondrites according to Jarosewich (1990) may be of the order of
0.1wt%, which converts to a H/Si-ratio of the order of 10‚àí4 which approximately correponds to the H/Si ratio of the
experiments under ‚Äúwet‚Äù conditions in Zhang et al. (2020). The coeÔ¨Écients for Eq. (22) given for this case are used in
our model calculations and are shown in Table 6. The values of other parameters used in the calculation of sintering
are also given in Table 6.
