We introduce a novel and concise methodology to detect the parity of atomic and molecular or-
bitals based on photoelectron holography, which is more general than the existing schemes. It fully
accounts for the Coulomb distortions of electron trajectories, does not require sculpted ﬁelds to
retrieve phase information and, in principle, is applicable to a broad range of electron momenta.
By comparatively measuring the diﬀerential photoelectron spectra from strong-ﬁeld ionization of
N2 molecules and their companion atoms of Ar, some photoelectron holography patterns are found
to be dephased for both targets. This is well reproduced by the full-dimensional time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation and the Coulomb quantum-orbit strong-ﬁeld approximation (CQSFA) simu-
lation. Using the CQSFA, we trace back our observations to diﬀerent parities of the 3p orbital of Ar
and the highest-occupied molecular orbital of N2 via interfering Coulomb-distorted quantum orbits
carrying diﬀerent initial phases. This method could in principle be used to extract bound-state
phases from any holographic structure, with a wide range of potential applications in recollision
physics and spectroscopy.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Parity is of fundamental importance in many areas of
physics, e.g., atomic and molecular physics, cosmology,
and particle physics. It is conserved in electromagnetism,
strong interactions, and gravity, but not in weak inter-
actions [1]. In quantum mechanics, it mostly relates to
the symmetry of wave functions representing microscopic
particles, and to quantum phase diﬀerences. For an atom
or molecule interacting with a strong laser ﬁeld, the par-
ity of electronic orbitals governs many phenomena such
as resonant multiphoton transitions [2], molecular ioniza-
tion suppression [3], and the phase diﬀerences acquired
by the tunneling wave packet [4–7].

In the context of above-threshold ionization (ATI),
schemes to detect parity using quantum interference have
been proposed. For instance, one may use sculpted ﬁelds
[8], where Coulomb eﬀects has been approximated by
a simple eikonal phase, or interference carpets, whose
explanation ignores the residual Coulomb potential [9].
However, Coulomb distortion represents a troublesome
issue for directly probing parity, as it modiﬁes the inter-
fering trajectories themselves [10–12]. This includes the
number of trajectories, their shapes, initial momenta and
ionization times. Thus, it is questionable whether addi-
tional phase shifts around Coulomb-free orbits will lead
to a reliable modeling of the system’s dynamics. A way
around this is to consider momentum ranges for which

the Coulomb potential is not crucial and adopt highly
directional methods. For instance, in [9] scattering an-
gles perpendicular to the driving-ﬁeld polarization, for
which Coulomb eﬀects cancel out, were used. Further-
more, in [8] only a small portion of photoelectrons with
low perpendicular and high parallel momenta with re-
spect to laser polarization is suitable for inferring the
parity information. This limits the applicability of such
methods, and may be problematic for larger systems such
as polyatomic molecules, which may be diﬃcult to align.
It is also noteworthy that, even for simple molecules, the
detection of parity for molecular systems remains elu-
sive. In this paper, we introduce a general and concise
diﬀerential holographic method which deals with above
issues.

Ultrafast photoelectron holography [13, 14] is a very
powerful imaging technique based on the physical pic-
ture of laser-driven recollision [15] which combines high
electron currents with subfemtosecond time resolution.
Thereby, a probe and a reference wave are employed to re-
construct a target by recording phase diﬀerences between
them. Both probe and reference terms stem from qual-
itatively diﬀerent ionization pathways, which can be as-
sociated to interfering electron wave packets. This phase
encoding makes it an ideal tool to probe the parity of the
atomic and molecular orbitals (for a review see [14]).

Since its inception, ultrafast photoelectron holography
has been used for extracting not only structural informa-
tion [16], but also for visualizing the attosecond dynamics
of valence electron motion [17], and revealing the coupled
electronic and nuclear dynamics of molecules [18]. Promi-
nent holographic examples are the spider-like [13], the
carpet-like [9], and the near-threshold fan-shaped struc-
tures [19–21]. The spider and in particular the fan are

 
 
 
 
 
 
caused by the interplay between the residual Coulomb
potential and the laser ﬁeld [22–24]. Recently, a novel
orbit-based approach that incorporates the Coulomb po-
tential and the laser ﬁeld on equal footing, the Coulomb
quantum-orbit strong-ﬁeld approximation (CQSFA) [10],
has oﬀered a transparent picture of diﬀerent interfer-
ence structures. It also predicted a novel spiral-like holo-
graphic structure [12], whose high-energy limit gives the
interference carpets in [9].

Here we demonstrate, both experimentally and theo-
retically, that photoelectron holography is a sensitive tool
for probing the parity of atomic and molecular orbitals.
We introduce a novel diﬀerential holographic method us-
ing an atom with comparable Coulomb eﬀects to retrieve
the parity of molecular orbital. Our article is organized
as follows. In Sec. II, we outline the strategy to be fol-
lowed and brieﬂy discuss its experimental realization. In
Sec. III we provide the theoretical background necessary
to model and interpret our results. These are presented
in Sec. V we state
and discussed in Sec. IV. Finally,
our conclusions.
Information of either complementary
or technical nature is provided in the appendix.

II. STRATEGY AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our basic strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1. Let us con-
sider an atomic or molecular orbital of odd parity. When
irradiated by an intense laser pulse, the tunnel ionized
electrons ending up with same ﬁnal momentum lead to
various interference patterns in the photoelectron mo-
mentum distribution. Within the CQSFA [10], each tra-
jectory carries a phase that can be separated into two
parts, i.e., the initial phase which includes the parity
of the atomic or molecular orbital and the phase ac-
cumulated along the pathway from the origin until the
detector. For each given ﬁnal momentum, the electron
trajectories can be distinguished into four groups, as in-
troduced in CQSFA [10] or trajectory-based Coulomb-
strong-ﬁeld approximation theory [25]. For type-I trajec-
tories, the electron moves directly to the detector without
revisiting its parent core. For type-II and type-III tra-
jectories, the electron ﬁrst moves away from the detector
and then turns around and ﬁnally arrives at the detector.
For type-IV trajectories, the electron initially moving to
the detector goes around the core and then again moves
towards the detector.
Ignoring the subcycle distortion
of the orbital by the laser ﬁeld, one can expect a shift
of π between the initial phase of type-I and type-II (also
type-III and type-IV) trajectories for an orbital with odd
parity since they come from two opposite sides of the tar-
get, while there will be no such phase shift for an orbital
with even parity. For the spider-like structures, there will
always be no initial phase shift irrespective of the orbital
parity, because type-II and type-III trajectories are re-
leased on the same side. A summary is provided in Table
I.

To experimentally realize the strategy, we use Ar as

nal photoelectron momentum distributions (right hand side).
The lower panel on the left side indicates the contour lines of
laser-distorted potentials for an Ar atom at two adjacent laser
ﬁeld peaks. The laser peak intensity is chosen as 6.5 × 1013
W/cm2 here. The interferences between types I and II (II and
III) trajectories are responsible for the fan-shaped (spider-
like) structures [26, 28, 29]. The carpet-like structures result
from the interferences between type-III and type-IV trajecto-
ries along the transverse direction [12]. Within the CQSFA
theory, trajectories that pass closer than the tunnel exit can
be considered as soft or hard rescattering, where hard rescat-
tering trajectories pass within the Bohr radius, while soft
rescattering do not. Trajectories of type III and IV are al-
ways rescattering ones here [12].

a reference atom to reveal information about the tar-
get molecule N2. One important reason for this target
choice is that the ground state 3p of Ar and the highest-
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of N2 have odd and
even parities, respectively. Additionally, according to the
CQSFA theory [10, 26], for each type of trajectory in
identical laser ﬁelds, the phase obtained along the contin-
uum propagation is expected to be nearly identical for Ar
and N2 due to their close ionization potentials and simi-
lar long-range Coulomb eﬀects, as we will see below. The
initial phase encoding the parity of the atomic or molecu-
lar orbital is thus accessed by comparing the holographic
patterns of the two targets. We ﬁnd that the measured
fan-shaped (and carpet-like) patterns show out of phase
features for Ar and N2, whereas the spider-like patterns

are in phase under identical laser conditions, which is
in contrast with previous diﬀerential measurements [27].
The observations are reproduced by a numerical solution
of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE), as
well as the CQSFA simulation. In terms of the CQSFA
theory, we demonstrate that our ﬁndings can be ascribed
to the diﬀerent parities of the 3p orbital of Ar and the
HOMO of N2. This also deﬁes the previous narrative
that strong-ﬁeld ionization of N2 behaves like Ar and
thus sheds new light on the topic.

In our experiments, intense laser pulses at a central
wavelength of 788 nm were generated by a commer-
cial Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser system (100 kHz, 100
µJ, 45 fs, Wyvern-500, KMLabs). The laser beam was
then focused by a spherical concave mirror (f = 60
mm) onto a cold supersonic jet of mixture of Ar and
N2 inside the main chamber of a Cold Target Recoil Ion
Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) reaction micro-
scope [30]. The use of a mixture gas jet substantially
reduces the systematic uncertainties resulting from the
absolute determination of each gas target density as well
as the laser intensity, and beam pointing ﬂuctuations
during long-time measurements. The laser intensity in
the interaction region was calibrated by measuring the
“donut”-shape momentum distribution of singly charged
Ne+ ions with circularly polarized light [31]. We did not
align the N2 molecules throughout our measurements.

We employed the COLTRIMS setup to simultaneously
measure the three-dimensional momentum distributions
of the electrons and ions from ionization of Ar and N2.
The photoelectrons and photoions were guided by homo-
geneous electric (27.6 V/cm) and magnetic (9.5 G) ﬁelds
towards two microchannel plate detectors equipped with
delay-line anodes [32] in order to obtain the positions of
impinging particles. The spectrometer consisted of an
ion arm with a 18.2 cm acceleration region and a 40.0
cm drift region, and an electron arm with an accelera-
tion region of 7.8 cm. By checking for momentum con-
servation between the detected electrons and the singly
charged ions, the events arising from false coincidences
were suppressed substantially.

III. THEORY

A. Time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

In the resent study, the TDSE was solved in the ve-
locity gauge. We employed a cosine square function
to represent the temporal proﬁle of the laser pulse.
The details about the TDSE simulations can be found
elsewhere [33, 34]. For Ar, the simulation was per-
formed within the single-active-electron approximation
for an eﬀective model potential V (r) = −(1 + a1e−a2r +
a3re−a4r + a5e−a6r)/r with a1 = 16.039, a2 = 2.007, a3 =
−25.543, a4 = 4.525, a5 = 0.961, and a6 = 0.443 [35] con-
sidering a 3p (m = 0) orbital neglecting spin orbit in-
teraction. For N2 we only considered the HOMO in the

3

simulation, and used the linear combination of atomic or-
bitals (LCAO) approximation [36]. This is reasonable as
the sharp fringes in the experimental interference carpets
suggest a single dominant orbital.

B. Coulomb quantum-orbit strong ﬁeld

The CQSFA theory describes ionization in terms of
quantum orbits from the saddle-point evaluation of the
Coulomb-distorted transition amplitude.

spectively. One can ﬁnd distinct fan-shaped interference
patterns near the ionization threshold (enclosed by the
half circles), i.e., four smaller lobes distributed symmet-
rically with respect to pz = 0 a.u. for Ar and ﬁve lobes
with the middle one along pz = 0 a.u.
for N2. For the
spider-like structures, the constructive interferences, i.e.,
the “spider’s legs” for Ar are analogous with that for
N2. Around pz = 0 a.u., for 0.55 a.u. < p⊥ < 0.95
a.u., the carpet-like structures as revealed in previous
experiments on Xe [9] can be recognised for both Ar
and N2 (conﬁned by the rectangles). For an intensity of
6.5 × 1013 W/cm2, the rectangles cover a number of ATI
rings ranging from the 4th to the 7th order. The carpet-
like structures clearly exhibit diﬀerent features for Ar and
N2. To highlight this discrepancy, we produced a diﬀer-
ential hologram by calculating the normalized diﬀerence
[DAr(p) − DN2(p)]/[DAr(p) + DN2 (p)], where DAr and
DN2 denotes the photoelectron distribution for Ar and
N2, respectively. Here DAr and DN2 has been normal-
ized to the corresponding maximum photoelectron yield,
respectively. The experimental diﬀerential hologram is
displayed in Fig. 3(a). This hologram reveals that, along
pz = 0 a.u., every odd-order (the 5th and 7th orders) ATI
rings exhibit minima for Ar but maxima for N2. While
for every even-order ATI rings (the 4th, 6th, and 8th or-
ders), maxima for Ar but minima for N2 are observed. In
general, when comparing Ar and N2, both the fan-shaped
and carpet-like interferences are out of phase while the
spider-like interferences are in phase.

The TDSE simulations are shown in Figs. 2(c) and
2(d). Many key features of the experimental results, as
described above, are satisfyingly reproduced by our simu-
lations. More lobes for the fan-shaped structures around
pz = 0 a.u. in the simulations are not well resolved in the
experiments due to the insuﬃcient momentum resolution
along the transverse direction.

The CQSFA calculated results shown in Figs. 2(e)
and 2(f) agree well with our observations and also the
TDSE simulations. The main features of the fan-shaped,
spider- and carpet-like structures for Ar and N2 are faith-
fully reproduced. The CQSFA underestimates the signal
near the polarization axis due to approximations in the
continuum propagation [43]. Figure 3(b) displays the
calculated diﬀerential hologram highlighting the diﬀer-

These equations are solved using an iteration scheme
for any given ﬁnal momentum [10] under the assump-
tion that the electron is ionized by tunneling from t0 to
tR
0 = Re[t0] and then reaches the detector at a ﬁnal (real)
time [41, 42]. For simplicity, we used −1/r as the form
of Coulomb potential for both Ar and N2 in the simu-
lations. Close to the origin, a regularisation procedure
was implemented to treat the Coulomb singularities in
the complex time plane (See [43] and references therein).
The GAMESS code [44] was adopted to calculate the
exact wave functions of the 3p, m = 0 state for Ar, ne-
glecting spin orbit interaction and the HOMO of N2.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) we present the measured pho-
toelectron momentum distributions of Ar and N2, re-

ence of the carpet structures. Again, we ﬁnd very good
agreement between the experiment and simulation.
In
the CQSFA computations, we consider ionization events
only from a ﬁnite section of a monochromatic laser ﬁeld.
There will be a ﬁxed starting point, which introduces and
eﬀective carrier-envelope phase. This will lead to some
left-right asymmetry. We consider ionization events over
four cycles, which causes ATI rings. Including more cy-
cles would not aﬀect the position of the rings, only their
contrast. The energy region is beyond the direct ATI
cutoﬀ 2Up (Up is the ponderomotive potential. Thus,
the carpet is formed by electron trajectories that interact
strongly with the core and can only be well reproduced
by the interference between types III and IV trajectories
within the CQSFA theory (see Fig. 1). Type III orbits
have no counterpart in the SFA and behave like ﬁeld-
dressed Kepler hyperbolae, while type IV orbits behave
like rescattered SFA trajectories. This is in contrast to
previous interpretation based on the SFA theory that the
carpet arises from direct electrons [9]. For more details
on this speciﬁc structure see our recent publication [45].

Encouraged by the overall agreement, we further ex-
plore the physical origin of our observations. From
Eq. (2) we learn that the interference patterns are closely
related to the phase Re[S], which is accumulated along
the pathway starting from the original position, and the
prefactor C(t0,s) associated with the atomic or molecular
orbital ψ0 [Eq. (3)]. The stability factor ∂ps(t)/∂rs(t0,s)
is a real term and contains no phase information. In iden-
tical laser ﬁelds, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerence between phase
Re[S] for diﬀerent types of trajectory is nearly identical
for Ar and N2, due to their nearly identical ionization
potentials (see Appendix for details). Moreover, the sim-
ulations without inclusion of the prefactor C(t0,s) reveal
practically identical features for Ar and N2 (not shown
here). Therefore, our observations can be attributed to
the diﬀerent prefactors for Ar and N2.

(cid:113)

Physically, the prefactor C(t0,s) contains the tunneling
2πi/(∂2S(˜ps, rs, t0,s, t)/∂t2
probability
0,s) and the tun-
neling matrix element (cid:104)ps(t0,s) + A(t0,s) | ˆHI (t0,s)| ψ0(cid:105).
For each trajectory type, the phase of the prefactor, i.e.,
Φ0,s = arg[C(t0,s)], is related to the parity of the atomic
and molecular orbital. The tunneling probability term
has a simple phase that will not be aﬀected by this par-
ity. Here s =1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to types I, II, III,
and IV trajectories, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1.
In the Appendix, we explain how Φ0,s leads to the phase
diﬀerences (or absence thereof) in speciﬁc holographic
structures. The analysis veriﬁes the physical picture il-
lustrated in Fig. 1: Both the carpet-like and fan-shaped
interference structures are sensitive to the parity of the
electronic orbital of the target.

V. CONCLUSION

5

In summary, we show that the parity of atomic and
molecular orbitals can be inferred from ultrafast holo-
graphic patterns. By using a reference atom and dif-
ferential measurement, we show that holography pat-
terns such as fan-shaped and carpet-like structures are
dephased, while the spider-like fringes show in phase fea-
tures when comparing Ar and N2 with identical laser
conditions. Our data is well reproduced by focal- and
alignment-averaged TDSE and CQSFA simulations. Us-
ing the CQSFA, we trace back the above-mentioned de-
phasing to parity-related phase diﬀerences in the inter-
fering quantum orbits. These phases can be attributed
to the diﬀerent parity of the 3p orbital for Ar and the
HOMO of N2.

The method presented in this work is general and can
in principle be applied to any holographic pattern in a
wide momentum range, for any target or molecular or-
bital. This may constitute an advantage over more direc-
tional methods such as those in [8] and [9], which require
restricted momentum ranges. Molecular orbitals other
than the HOMO may be probed by scanning alignment
angles for which their contributions prevail. This method
may also be extended to ultrafast detection of the parity
of multielectron wavefunctions or multiple orbitals, which
plays signiﬁcant roles in more complex molecules [46].
This will be particularly useful for interpreting complex
electron dynamics such as charge migration in polyatomic
and biological molecules. Finally, one key assumption
usually adopted in strong-ﬁeld ultrafast spectroscopy is
that the phase structure of the returning wave packets
due to the parity of the initial orbital is smeared out
during the propagation [47, 48]. However, our joint ex-
perimental and theoretical work clearly reveals the parity
eﬀects on the interference carpet through rescattering.

The power of this method lies in a choice of known com-
panion/ reference atom or molecule to image with. The
diﬀerences may then inform the features we are interestd
in measuring. This diﬀerence led to parity in the case of
Ar and N2, but it may be used to study other proper-
ties. For example, for similar polyatomic molecules, holo-
graphic discrepancies could be measured and their source
traced back to diﬀerences or changes in structure using
the trajectories in the CQSFA. Furthermore, one could
use isoelectronic homonuclear and heteronuclear molec-
ular pairs, as in [50], with the homonuclear molecule as
a reference. This is of great importance for advancing
strong-ﬁeld recollision physics and spectroscopy.

Ar is very similar with that for N2 in each panel.
In
Figs. 4(a) and 4(c), there is a small diﬀerence between
the results of Ar and N2 (the yellow lines), which stems
from the fact that the orbits taken into consideration
leave from opposite sides. In fact, the phase diﬀerence at
pz = 0 a.u. is roughly half a cycle times the diﬀerence of
both ionization potentials. This will be altered slightly
as the time diﬀerence changes as a function of the par-
allel momentum. In contrast, for orbits starting on the
same side, this diﬀerence is vanishingly small. The fact
that these features are subtle can be attributed to the
small diﬀerence in ionization potentials of Ar (15.76 eV)
and N2 (15.58 eV).

APPENDIX

According to the Coulomb quantum-orbit strong-ﬁeld
approximation (CQSFA) theory [14], the phase diﬀerence
between the involved trajectories plays a crucial role in
determining the interference structures. The phase for
each trajectory mainly includes two components:
the
phase obtained along the continuum propagation Re[Ss]
and the phase of the prefactor Φ0,s relating mainly to the
phase of the initial state, which includes the parity of the
atomic or molecular orbital. Here s = 1, 2, 3, and 4 corre-
spond to types I, II, III, and IV trajectories, respectively,
as explained in our main text. In the following, we will
show that, because the ionization potentials of both N2
and Ar are similar, the phase diﬀerence will stem mainly
from the prefactor.

ﬁrst and second columns show the results for Ar and N2, re-
spectively. The diﬀerences between the phase diagrams of Ar
and N2 are shown in the third column. The abscissa pz and
ordinate p⊥ are the ﬁnal electron momentum components.
The half circles, dotted lines, and rectangles mark the regions
where the fan-shaped, spider- and carpet-like structures ap-
pear, respectively. The illustrations of 3p orbital for Ar and
the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of N2 are
shown on the top. The alignment of N2 is along the laser
polarization axis here.

To reveal the inﬂuence of the parity of the atomic and
molecular orbitals, we calculate the phase of the prefac-
tor Φ0,s for trajectories leading to the interference pat-
terns of interest. Then we obtain the diﬀerence between
Φ0,s for the trajectories responsible for each interference
pattern, as shown in Fig. 5. For Ar, there is an addi-
tional ∼ π diﬀerence between Φ0,s for type-II and type-I
trajectories in the electron momentum region where the
fan-shaped structures appear [Fig. 5(a1)], while this ad-
ditional phase diﬀerence is around 0 for N2 [Fig. 5(b1)].
This is due to the diﬀerent parities of 3p orbital for Ar
and the HOMO of N2, since type-II and type-I trajecto-

FIG. 4. Calculations for diﬀerence between Re[Ss] for type-
II and type-I trajectories (a), between type-III and type-II
trajectories (b), and between type-III and type-IV trajectories
(c). The red and blue lines represent the results for Ar and
N2, respectively. The orange line in each panel represents
the diﬀerence between the result of Ar and that of N2. The
abscissa pz is the ﬁnal electron momentum along the laser
polarization. The ﬁnal electron momentum perpendicular to
the laser polarization p⊥ is 0.1 a.u. here. We have found
similar features for other values of p⊥. The alignment of N2
is along the laser polarization axis.

Figure. 4 shows the calculated phase diﬀerences, ob-
tained along the continuum propagation, between diﬀer-
ent types of trajectories for Ar and N2. The result for

ries arise from the opposite sides of the target. Figure
5(c1) shows the diﬀerence between Fig. 5(a1) and Fig.
5(b1). Now all other phases cancel, which clearly reveals
a π shift between the phase diagram of Ar and N2. The
same π phase shift can be found for the carpet-like in-
terference (third row of Fig. 5), where the trajectories
type-III and type-IV tunnel exits lie on opposite sides of
the target. For the region where the spider-like interfer-
ence shows up, the phase diﬀerence is basically the same

for Ar and N2 [Figs. 5(a2) and 5(b2)] because type-II
and type-III trajectories are released from the same side
of the target. There is thus no phase shift between the
phase diagram of Ar and N2 [Figs. 5(c2)]. Note that the
internuclear axis of N2 is aligned along the laser polariza-
tion axis in the above computation. The ionization prob-
ability for N2 is maximal for this alignment angle and
decreases fast for other alignment angles [49]. Thus, we
expect that this also holds true for randomly distributed
alignments of N2 in our experiments.
