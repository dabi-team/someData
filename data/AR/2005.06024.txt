The concept of perpendicular shape anisotropy spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access mem-
ory (PSA-STT-MRAM) consists in increasing the storage layer thickness to values comparable to
the cell diameter, to induce a perpendicular shape anisotropy in the magnetic storage layer. Making
use of that contribution, the downsize scalability of the STT-MRAM may be extended towards sub-
20 nm technological nodes, thanks to a reinforcement of the thermal stability factor ∆. Although
the larger storage layer thickness improves ∆, it is expected to negatively impact the writing current
and switching time. Hence, optimization of the cell dimensions (diameter, thickness) is of utmost
importance for attaining a suﬃciently high ∆ while keeping a moderate writing current. Micro-
magnetic simulations were carried out for diﬀerent pillar thicknesses of ﬁxed lateral size 20 nm.
The switching time and the reversal mechanism were analysed as a function of the applied voltage
and aspect-ratio (AR) of the storage layer. For AR < 1, the magnetization reversal resembles a
macrospin-like mechanism, while for AR > 1 a non-coherent reversal is observed, characterized by
the nucleation of a transverse domain wall at the ferromagnet/insulator interface which then prop-
agates along the vertical axis of the pillar. It was further observed that the inverse of the switching
time is linearly dependent on the applied voltage. This study was extended to sub-20 nm width
with a value of ∆ around 80. It was observed that the voltage necessary to reverse the magnetic
layer increases as the lateral size is reduced, accompanied with a transition from macrospin-reversal
to a buckling-like reversal at high aspect-ratios.

INTRODUCTION

The spin-transfer

torque magnetic random-access
memory (STT-MRAM) is one of the most promising
emerging non-volatile memory technologies [1–4]. It com-
bines non-volatility with a quasi-inﬁnite write endurance,
high speed, low power consumption and scalability [5–7].
These properties have stimulated the commercial pro-
duction of STT-MRAM for a variety of standalone and
embedded applications, in particular e-NOR FLASH re-
placement and last level Cache SRAM replacement [7–
11]. While initial STT-MRAM devices used an in-plane
(IP) magnetization, it has been shown that a perpendic-
ular orientation of the magnetization leads to a better
trade-oﬀ between the thermal stability factor ∆ = EB
kBT
(where EB is the energy barrier of the storage layer and
kBT is the thermal activation energy with kB being the
Boltzmann constant and T the operating temperature)
which determines the memory retention time, and the
switching current. These devices called perpendicular
STT-MRAM (p-STT-MRAM) use the interfacial perpen-
dicular magnetic anisotropy (iPMA) existing at the in-
terface between the FeCoB layer and the MgO tunnel
barrier[1, 5, 12]. Nonetheless, downsize scalability of
magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) below sub-20 nm di-

ameters faces a fundamental challenge.
Indeed, as the
device lateral size shrinks, there is a decrease in ∆ due
to the decrease in the iPMA total energy proportionally
to the cell area. This can be understood considering that
at these small dimensions, the reversal of the magnetic
volume is almost coherent, and so ∆ is proportional to
the device area. This decrease signiﬁcantly reduces the
retention time of the memory [13–15]. A proposal to
counter this decrease is to double the iPMA by using
two FeCo(B)/MgO interfaces [16]. Still, it remains chal-
lenging to keep ∆ > 80 at sub-20 nm diameters. A diﬀer-
ent approach consists in taking advantage of the shape
anisotropy of the storage layer by increasing its thick-
ness (L) to values of the order or larger than the storage
layer diameter. Thereby, the shape anisotropy no longer
promotes an easy-plane magnetization but rather further
stabilizes the magnetization in the perpendicular orien-
tation. This concept of memory, named perpendicular
shape anisotropy STT-MRAM (PSA-STT-MRAM), had
been studied and experimentally developed for the ﬁrst
time simultaneously by SPINTEC [17–21] and Tohoku
University [22]. As the thickness of the storage layer in-
creases, the magnetization is expected to be more stable
due to the larger total anisotropy [17–20, 22] thus allow-
ing to reduce the cell diameter beyond 20nm while main-
taining a suﬃciently large thermal stability. Another
notable advantage of PSA-STT-MRAM is the much re-
duced sensitivity of their properties to the operating tem-
perature [20]. This is due to the fact that the magnetic

properties of their thick storage layer (in particular the
thermal variation of its magnetization) are much closer
to those of the bulk material than in conventional p-STT-
MRAM, wherein the storage layer is only 1.5 nm to 2 nm
thick. Thermal magnetic ﬂuctuations can much more
easily develop in such thin layers than in thicker ones.
However, the increased aspect-ratio (AR) of the storage
layer in PSA-STT-MRAM may lead to a non-coherent
reversal, higher switching voltages and longer switching
times. For this purpose, the understanding of the mag-
netization reversal mechanism is necessary. In this work,
micromagnetic simulations of the magnetization rever-
sal mechanism of PSA-MTJs induced by STT were re-
alised, enabling the identiﬁcation of diﬀerent features of
the magnetization reversal. This study was realised on
a pillar with ﬁxed width of 20 nm and AR between 0.8
and 3.
In a subsequent study, the width of the pillar
was reduced to sub-20 nm dimensions, with an AR se-
lected in order to maintain ∆ around 80. In both studies,
the reversal mechanism and the dependency between the
switching time and the applied voltage was analysed.

II. MICROMAGNETIC MODEL

The magnetization dynamics is described by the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation.
We consider the material FeCo(B) (Fig. 1), with a spon-
taneous magnetization Ms = 1 MA/m, an exchange stiﬀ-
ness Aex = 15 pJ/m and a damping value α of 0.01
[23]. The simulations were performed using the ﬁnite-
diﬀerences micro3D solver with a cubic cell size δz of 2
nm3 [24]. The eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld Heﬀ is calculated
for each cell element. The iPMA is implemented numer-
ically using an evanescent uniaxial contribution:

with N the number of cell layers along the deﬁned evanes-

In Fig. 1 b) the equilibrium states of a magnetic pillar,
with and without the eﬀect of the interfacial anisotropy,
are compared for a pillar with a squared base width of
20 nm and a thickness of 60 nm. From Fig. 1 b) (left
panel), a ﬂower state is observed at both the top and
bottom surfaces [25]. When adding an iPMA at the bot-
tom interface, a sturdier perpendicular orientation of the
magnetization is enforced, Fig. 1 b) (right panel).

Starting from the equilibrium state with iPMA, a spin-
polarized current is injected. In a thin MTJ, this eﬀect is

included in the LLGS equation as a damping-like torque
term (ΓIP
STT) and a ﬁeld-like torque (the latter neglected
in the following equations) [1]:

where a(cid:107) is the pre-factor of the damping-like torque,

vector of the storage layer and mRL the normalized mag-
netization vector of the reference layer.

normalized magnitude of the magnetization along the deﬁned
z direction (along the pillar axis) in each cell.

As the injection of current occurs at the bottom inter-
face, the spin polarization is expected physically to decay
exponentially through the interaction with the magneti-
zation [26, 27]. We can model this eﬀect assuming that
the value of a(cid:107) decreases spatially as:

The value of the coeﬃcient a0 can be obtained knowing
that the averaged sum of each plane of cells along the
material will result in the macrospin value of (cid:104)a(cid:107)(cid:105):

calculate the coeﬃcient a0 in the following way:

In the present work, both decay lengths are assumed to
be of 1 nm. In addition, considering the very small area
of the pillar, operable PSA-STT-MRAM pillars require
a RA product of the order of 1 Ω · µm2 to avoid ex-
cessive write voltages which may yield dielectric break-
down. Since the STT eﬃciency is a function of the tunnel
magnetoresistance (TMR) [28–30], and assuming that in
our device the TMR is higher than 100 %, a value of
ηSTT = 0.5 is used.

III. MAGNETIZATION REVERSAL DRIVEN
BY STT

We consider hereafter a set of magnetic pillars with
constant width of 20 nm and diﬀerent pillar thicknesses
(L = 16, 18, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 nm). Figure 2 shows
the average magnetization along the vertical axis (growth
direction) of the storage layer as a function of time for
the diﬀerent thicknesses for an applied voltage of -3 V.
This voltage range is actually experimentally inaccessible
since it would cause the dielectric breakdown of the tun-
nel barrier. However, one could reduce this voltage range
by lowering the junction RA product to values much be-
low 1 Ω · µm2 (as is the case in recording heads) at the
expense of a lower TMR. It is observed that, for the same
voltage, an increase in thickness results in an increase in
the time it takes to start reversing the magnetic layer.
While for a thickness of 16 nm, the switching mechanism
exhibits a rather sharp variation of the magnetization
during reversal, a slower relaxation is obtained for the
thicker layers (see e.g. 40 and 50 nm in ﬁgure 2). Fur-
ther increasing the thickness of the storage layer leads to
a change in the reversal proﬁle. Around 52 nm, the mag-
netization reversal starts exhibiting a shoulder, an eﬀect
that worsens as the layer thickness is increased up to 60
nm.

To understand the underlying mechanism of reversal
in these structures, we can resort to the 3D trajectories
described by the mean magnetization vector inside the
unitary sphere, shown in ﬁgure 3.

Indeed, from these trajectories, we can infer that the
switching mechanism is thickness-dependent: for a 16 nm
thickness, a typical macrospin switching trajectory is ob-
served since the normalized magnetic moment keeps its
maximum amplitude throughout the magnetic reversal.
When increasing the thickness to 40 nm, the switching
trajectory no longer lies on the unitary sphere. This ef-
fect is more pronounced for a thickness of 60 nm, com-
bined with a slowing down of the dynamics. This slowing
down was already observed in ﬁgure 2, related with the

nesses. The z-axis represents (cid:104)mz(cid:105) and the basal plane (x

tained in a macrospin sphere (radius 1). Results obtained for
an applied voltage of -3 V for a pillar thickness of 16, 40 and
60 nm width a ﬁxed width of W = 20 nm.

shoulder near (cid:104)mz(cid:105) ≈ 0. We can further observe this
behaviour from the 3D snapshots of the magnetization,
shown in ﬁgure 4 at diﬀerent time steps, for the 3 diﬀerent
thicknesses, 16 nm, 40 nm and 60 nm. Starting with the
lower thickness of 16 nm: the macrospin regime is identi-
ﬁed, the magnetization rotates coherently. Even though
the model assumes the STT to decay exponentially from
the MgO interface, at these dimensions, the exchange in-
teractions are strong enough to insure coherent reversal.
For the thickness of 40 nm, the magnetization reversal
follows a buckling-like mechanism since the whole mag-
netic layer reacts simultaneously during the reversal but
in a non-uniform way[31–33]. For the larger thickness
of 60 nm, the nucleation of a domain wall starts at the
bottom interface (where the STT is being transfered).
Two magnetic domains, in a tail-to-tail domain wall con-
ﬁguration are observed in the frame at 11.5 ns. The
domain wall then propagates along the vertical direction
of the magnetic layer, while it rotates azimuthally in the

transverse plane (as seen for example in ﬁgure 3). This
mechanism of reversal is thus identiﬁed as a transverse
domain wall propagation [34].

behaviour. This was already expected from ﬁgure 2, as
there is a clear deviation from the macrospin regime.

FIG. 4. Snapshots at diﬀerent time steps (at bold is shown
the time were we reverse 10%, 50% and 90% of the magnetic
layer) for a 16 nm, 40 nm and 60 nm (at an applied voltage of
- 3 V) thick magnetic layer with a width of 20 nm. The color
is representative of the magnitude of (cid:104)mz(cid:105) and quantiﬁed in
the color bar.

From the dependencies observed in ﬁgure 2, it is pos-
sible to extract an important feature of the STT-driven
reversal, the dependency of the switching time on the ap-
plied voltage. This switching time is deﬁned as the time
it takes to reverse half of the magnetic volume - τswitch -
which, in a macrospin regime, is given when the magne-
tization lies perpendicular to its initial orientation, i.e.
(cid:104)mz(cid:105) = 0. This is shown in ﬁgure 5, with an inset show-
ing the dependency of the inverse of τswitch versus applied
voltage. This relationship is found to be linear, which is
a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum
during the reversal process [35–37]. Moreover, the slope
of this linear behaviour is related to the magnitude of
the perpendicular anisotropy ﬁeld (H⊥) and to (cid:104)a(cid:107)(cid:105) (us-
ing equation 6) [23]:

with A and B thickness independent constants.

Indeed, ﬁxing the diameter and increasing the thick-
ness leads to an increase in H⊥, as it is dominated by
the contribution of the PSA (the value of the iPMA is
ﬁxed for all the diﬀerent thicknesses). In addition, with
increasing thickness, (cid:104)a(cid:107)(cid:105) is reduced (see equation 6). As
a result, the slope becomes steeper as long as the reversal
is coherent (AR of 0.8 and 0.9). Further increasing the
thickness of the storage layer leads to a diﬀerent evolu-
tion of the slope, which reﬂects the non-coherent reversal

FIG. 5. Dependency of the switching time on the applied volt-
age for the diﬀerent AR values studied. The coherent reversal
is highlighted with a pinkish watermark and the non-coherent
with a blue watermark. The inset shows the dependency of
the inverse of the switching time on the applied voltage.

Moreover, it is observed that an increase in thickness
is accompanied by an increase in the minimum voltage to
reverse the magnetic layer, which, as will be shown below,
is due to an increase in the thermal stability factor. This
means that at this width, an AR much higher than 1
would not be practical for a working device, because of
the high switching voltage and slow reversal mechanism.

FIG. 6. Minimum energy path of the energy barrier for dif-
ferent thicknesses of the storage layer with a ﬁxed diameter
of 20 nm.

The thermal stability can be calculated using the string
method [38–42], which computes the minimum energy
path (MEP) that the magnetization follows to reverse be-
tween its two stable states (magnetization up or down),

shown in Fig. 6. As expected, increasing the thickness of
the storage layer signiﬁcantly increases the energy bar-
rier, leading to an increase in ∆, which rapidly gets pro-
hibitively large for AR higher than 1. Thus, it is im-
portant to take into consideration the AR of the storage
layer when designing the device, as ∆ is very sensitive to
the layer thickness.

IV. STT-DRIVEN REVERSAL IN SUB-20 NM
WIDTH MTJ WITH ∆ ≈ 80

From the perspective of device applications, one should
stay within a reasonable value of ∆ (typically in the range
60-100 depending on the memory speciﬁed retention and
acceptable bit error rate). This is the case for an AR <
∼ 1
at these selected material parameters. Staying within
this AR also leads to a coherent reversal, avoiding the
longer switching time and higher voltages needed for the
high AR pillars. As such, we studied diﬀerent AR combi-
nations giving a ∆ of around 80, with dimensions (both
width and thickness) in the sub-20 nm design space. For
these simulations, as we are using smaller thickness than
before, the cell size was reduced from 2 nm to 1 nm. The
selected dimensions of the storage layer comprise widths
of 18, 16, 14, 12 and 10 nm, with an adjusted AR of 0.9,
1, 1.1, 1.3 and 1.8, respectively.

Even though ∆ is the same, it is possible to observe
two diﬀerent reversal mechanisms in the 3D snapshots
of the magnetization, shown in ﬁgure 7 at diﬀerent time
steps. It is observed that if we keep an AR near 1, the
magnetization reversal is coherent, while for a larger AR,
non-coherent reversal occurs.

FIG. 7. Snapshots at diﬀerent time steps (in bold are shown
τ10%, τ50% and τ90% in ns) for a pillar of 14 nm width and 16
nm thickness (at an applied voltage of - 1 V) and a pillar of
10 nm width and 18 nm thickness (at an applied voltage of -
1.4 V). The color is representative of the magnitude of (cid:104)mz(cid:105)
and quantiﬁed in the color bar.

conservation of the linear behaviour between τ −1
switch and
the applied voltage. By increasing the AR, the volt-
age required to reverse the magnetization in the storage
layer increases, even though the thermal stability factor is
ﬁxed. In addition, there is no clear variation in the slope
for the AR’s of 0.9, 1 and 1.1, which can be attributed
to the similar value of (cid:104)a(cid:107)(cid:105) and the weak variation of the
PSA (in comparison with the signiﬁcant variation in AR
seen in ﬁgure 5). When increasing the AR from 1.1 to
1.3 and 1.8, we can see a diﬀerence in slope, related to
a non-uniform reversal. Indeed, at these dimensions, the
reversal is no longer macrospin and the nature of the re-
versal is strongly linked to the dipolar coupling created
by these low width pillars, leading to a buckling-like re-
versal, as observed in ﬁgure 7.

FIG. 8. Dependency of the the switching time with the ap-
plied voltage for the diﬀerent studied AR. The inset shows
the dependency of the inverse of the switching time on the
applied voltage.

This allows us to conclude that the type of magneti-
zation reversal is dependent on the AR and not on the
∆ itself. In a ﬁrst approach, it seems diﬃcult to avoid
the non-coherent reversal that accompanies the high AR
required to maintain the perpendicular anisotropy when
going to sub-20 nm. A possible solution to this challenge
was experimentally presented by B. Jinnai et. al. [43, 44],
in which a thin non-magnetic spacer layer is placed in
the middle of the storage layer. With this design, it
is no longer energetically favourable for a non-coherent
reversal to occur, leading to the possibility of having a
coherent-reversal in sub-20 nm PSA-STT-MRAM.

V. CONCLUSION

The dependency of the switching time on the applied
voltage is shown in ﬁgure 8, with the inset showing the

Using micromagnetic calculations, we have investi-
gated the magnetization reversal in the PSA-MTJ at sub-
20 nm width. For a ﬁxed width of 20 nm, it was observed

that for the pillars with smaller AR, the reversal exhibits
a macrospin-like behaviour. When increasing the thick-
ness, a non-coherent reversal takes place, which evolves
from a buckling-like reversal to a transverse-domain wall
propagation for higher AR. The latter is associated with
a slowing down of the dynamics when the domain wall
is located around the middle of the storage layer. It was
further observed that the inverse of the switching time
follows a linear relationship versus applied voltage.

Considering practical device applications, we main-
tained a thermal stability factor of around 80 and varied
the width beyond sub-20 nm dimensions. As in the ﬁrst
study, the magnetization reversal evolved from macrospin
to a non-coherent reversal with increasing AR. This al-
lowed us to conclude that the type of magnetization re-
versal mainly depends on the AR and not on the ∆ itself.
Moreover, the linear dependency τ −1
switch ∝ V is main-
tained over the whole range of cell diameters investigated.
This study provides some guidelines for the design of
PSA-STT-MRAM, that can be summarized as follow: (1)
the resistance×area product , as used previously, must
be lowered in comparison to that in conventional STT-
MRAM to maintain the write voltage signiﬁcantly below
the barrier breakdown voltage.
(2) The ∆ should be
maintained around a window of 60-100 depending on the

6

memory retention and acceptable bit error rate speciﬁca-
tions, which corresponds to an AR ≈ 1. Using two MgO
interfaces instead of one is a possibility to further reduce
the storage layer thickness. This allows to avoid excessive
voltages and the slowing down introduced by the domain
wall nucleation and propagation.
(3) In macrospin re-
versal, the switching time can be reduced to values of
the order of 20 ns - which makes this type of memory
not ultrafast but still compatible with DRAM type of
applications (for instance battery-backed DRAM), pro-
vided high memory densities can be obtained. In addi-
tion, besides the e-NOR FLASH replacement mentioned
in the introduction, by lowering the RA product to sub-
1 Ω · µm2 values, the switching time could be further
reduced opening prospects of applications as SRAM for
low power wearable systems, all sorts of micro-controllers
and internet of things devices.
