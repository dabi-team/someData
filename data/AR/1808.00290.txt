BASED ON CURVATURE AND TORSION

YUXIN WANG, HUAFEI SUN, YANG SONG, YUEQI CAO, AND SHIQIANG ZHANG

Abstract. This paper focuses on using curvature and torsion to describe the stability of linear
time-invariant system. We prove that for a two-dimensional system ˙r(t) = Ar(t), (i) if there
exists an initial value, such that zero is not the limit of curvature of trajectory as t → +∞,
then the zero solution of the system is stable; (ii) if there exists an initial value, such that the
limit of curvature of trajectory is inﬁnity as t → +∞, then the zero solution of the system is
asymptotically stable. For a three-dimensional system, (i) if there exists a measurable set whose
Lebesgue measure is greater than zero, such that for all initial values in this set, zero is not the
limit of curvature of trajectory as t → +∞, then the zero solution of the system is stable; (ii) if
the coeﬃcient matrix is invertible, and there exists a measurable set whose Lebesgue measure is
greater than zero, such that for all initial values in this set, the limit of curvature of trajectory
is inﬁnity as t → +∞, then the zero solution of the system is asymptotically stable; (iii) if there
exists a measurable set whose Lebesgue measure is greater than zero, such that for all initial
values in this set, zero is not the limit of torsion of trajectory as t → +∞, then the zero solution
of the system is asymptotically stable.

1. Introduction

Stability is an important subject in the control theory, which is the premise for the control system
to work properly. In 1892, Russian mathematician Lyapunov ([4]) gave a rigorous mathematical
deﬁnition and research method for stability of motion, which laid the foundation for stability
theory. Linear systems are the most basic objects in the ﬁeld of control science. Linear system
theory is the basis of many other branches of system control theory. The stability of linear systems
has some well-known criteria, such as the method of Lyapunov functions, Routh-Hurwitz criterion,
Mikhailov criterion, and Nyquist criterion.

It is well known that the general relativity theory by Einstein used diﬀerential geometry where
the curvatures describing how curved of the space play the signiﬁcant role. As S. S. Chern said,
curvature is the core concept of diﬀerential geometry. Curvatures are used in lots of research
ﬁelds, such as [8, 9]. In the diﬀerential geometry of three-dimensional Euclidean space, curvature
and torsion describe the degree of bending and twisting of the curve, respectively. Curvature
and torsion are invariants of rigid motion. Curvature function κ(t) > 0 and torsion function τ (t)
determine the only curve in the space R3 ([1]).

The aim of this paper is to use curvature and torsion to describe the stability of the zero solution

of linear time-invariant system ˙r(t) = Ar(t). Our main results are as follows.

Combined with Theorem 3.3, we complete the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Remark 4.4. If all eigenvalues of A are real numbers, namely, matrix A is similar to one of the two
cases (1) and (3) in Proposition 4.1. According to Table 4.1 and 4.3, combined with Theorem 3.3,
we obtain the following proposition.

Proposition 4.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, together with the assumption that all
eigenvalues of A are real numbers. If there exists an initial value r(0)

5. Three-Dimensional Systems

In the case of three-dimensional systems, Proposition 2.8 becomes the following result.

Proposition 5.1. Let A be a 3

Note that we have Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 in Section 3. In order to prove Theorem 1.2, we need

only consider the four cases in Proposition 5.1.

We notice that the initial value r(0) = (x0, y0, z0)T may aﬀect curvature κ(t) and torsion τ (t) of
curve r(t). For simplicity, in the calculations below, we always assume that x0y0z0 6
= 0. It will be
seen later (Section 5.5 and 5.6) that this assumption does not aﬀect the correctness of the proof
of Theorem 1.2.

We give the calculation details of curvatures and torsions in Appendix C.

Remark 5.2. If all eigenvalues of A are real numbers, namely, matrix A is similar to one of the
three cases (1), (3), and (4) in Proposition 5.1. According to Table 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4, combined
with Theorem 3.1 and 3.2, we obtain the following proposition.

Proposition 5.4. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.2, together with the assumption that A

The main results of this paper, Theorem 1.1 and 1.2, are proved. Firstly, we give the relation-
ship between curvatures of trajectories of two equivalent systems. Secondly, for each case of real
Jordan canonical forms, we analyse curvatures and torsions of trajectories for all situations of the
eigenvalues, which completes the proofs of theorems.

These two theorems give the relationship between curvature and stability. More precisely, several
suﬃcient conditions for stability of the zero solution of two or three-dimensional linear time-
invariant systems, based on curvature and torsion, are given. For each case of the two theorems,
we give an example to illustrate the results.

Further work: we will give the description of stability for higher dimensional linear time-invariant
systems, by curvatures, which may have some advantages for analysing the stability. Moreover,
the application will be investigated in the future.

Proof of Theorem 3.2. Recall that A = P −
decomposition P = U ∆V T = U diag
trajectory v(t) of the system ˙v(t) = Bv(t), using Lemma A.3, we have

1BP , and we suppose that P has the singular value
