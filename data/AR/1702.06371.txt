CONTACT STRUCTURES ON AR-SINGULARITY LINKS

C¸ A ˘GRI KARAKURT AND FER˙IT ¨OZT ¨URK

Abstract. An isolated complex surface singularity induces a canonical contact
structure on its link. In this paper, we initiate the study of the existence problem
of Stein cobordisms between these contact structures depending on the properties
of singularities. As a ﬁrst step we construct an explicit Stein cobordism from any
contact 3-manifold to the canonical contact structure of a proper almost rational
singularity introduced by N´emethi. We also show that the construction cannot
in fact the U-ﬁltration depth of contact
always work in the reverse direction:
Ozsv´ath-Szab´o invariant obstructs the existence of a Stein cobordism from a
proper almost rational singularity to a rational one. Along the way, we detect
the contact Ozsv´ath-Szab´o invariants of those contact structures ﬁllable by a AR
plumbing graph, generalizing an earlier work of the ﬁrst author.

1. Introduction
Let Z denote a complex analytic surface in CN which has an isolated singularity
at the origin. By intersecting Z with a small sphere centered at 0, we get a closed
oriented 3-manifold M , which is called the link of the singularity. The distribution
of complex tangencies on M is a contact distribution. In general the 3-manifold M
may be the link of many other analytically distinct isolated singularities, but the
induced contact structures are known to be contactomorphic [6]. If a 3-manifold is
realized as a link of an isolated singularity, then the associated contact structure is
called the canonical contact structure on M . Properties of these contact structures
have been extensively studied in the literature [1, 4, 19]. One remarkable feature
of canonical contact structures is that they are all Stein ﬁllable; a deformation of
the minimal resolution of a normal surface singularity and the Milnor ﬁber of a
smoothable singularity determine Stein ﬁllings of the canonical contact structure.

The purpose of the present paper is to address the existence problem of Stein
cobordisms between canonical contact structures on the link manifolds of various
classes of singularities. This is also related to the problem of symplectically embed-
ding one Milnor ﬁber into another. As a ﬁrst step we work on almost rational (AR)
singularities, which have been introduced by A. N´emethi as an extension of rational
singularities. Recall that a complex surface singularity is rational if its geometric
genus is zero. M. Artin found out that this is equivalent to the case when any pos-
itive divisorial 2-cycle in a resolution of the singularity has nonpositive arithmetic
genus; besides this last condition is independent of the resolution [2]. N´emethi in-
vestigated the behavior of the arithmetic genus function (which is equal to 1 − χ
where χ is as in (3.2)) on the lattice of homology 2-cycles of a resolution of a normal
surface singularity. Through his observation, he deduced that if a normal surface
singularity is rational then its link manifold M is an L-space [25, Theorem 6.3]; i.e.
M is a rational homology sphere and its Heegaard Floer homology is isomorphic to
that of a lens space. The converse of this statement was also proved recently in [24].
Now, an AR-singularity is one which admits a good resolution whose dual graph
is a negative deﬁnite, connected tree and has the following property: by reducing

the weight on a vertex we get the dual graph of a rational singularity. This property
allows one to compute the Heegaard Floer homology of the link by a combinatorial
process similar to Laufer’s method of ﬁnding Artin’s fundamental cycle [25]. Even
though the class of AR-singularities is restrictive, it is still large enough to contain
the rational singularities and all those singularities whose links are Seifert ﬁbered
rational homology spheres with negative deﬁnite plumbing graphs. We call an almost
rational singularity proper AR if it is not rational. After recalling some preliminaries
on contact structures in Section 2 and on plumbings in Section 3, we present our ﬁrst
result in Section 4 which claims the existence of a Stein cobordism from an arbitrary
contact structure to the canonical contact structure of a proper AR-singularity.

Theorem 1.1. Every closed, contact 3-manifold is Stein cobordant to the canonical
contact structure of a proper AR-singularity.

The proof of this theorem is an explicit construction of a Stein cobordism from

the given contact manifolds to Brieskorn spheres.

By contrast there are obstructions to existence of Stein cobordisms going in the
reverse direction. These obstructions come from Heegaard-Floer theory, particularly
its plus ﬂavor HF + [32, 31]. Recall that for any connected, closed, and oriented 3-
manifold M the Heegaard-Floer homology group HF +(M ) is a graded F[U ]-module,
where F = Z/2Z. Any oriented cobordism between two such manifolds induces
a graded F[U ] module homomorphism between the corresponding Heegaard-Floer
homology groups.

To any co-oriented contact structure ξ on a 3-manifold M , there is an associated
element c+(ξ) ∈ HF +(−M ), which is a contactomorphism invariant of the contact
structure and is natural under Stein cobordisms [33].
In particular if ξ is Stein
ﬁllable then c+(ξ) does not vanish since the tight structure on S3 has non-vanishing
c+. Moreover, U (c+(ξ)) = 0. Utilizing this property, one can generate a numerical
invariant of contact structures by letting

σ(ξ) = −Sup

d ∈ N ∪ {0} : c+(ξ) ∈ U d · HF +(−M )

.

The ﬁrst author showed that σ is monotone under Stein cobordisms and can take
all the values in the set {0, −1, −2, . . . , −∞} [16]. The computation of σ(ξ) is in
general hard, nevertheless we are able to show that it is zero for the canonical
contact structures of proper AR-singularities. The Stein cobordism obstructions
are obtained as immediate corollaries of this observation.

Theorem 1.2. Let (M, ξ) be the canonical contact link manifold of a proper AR-
singularity. Then σ(ξ) = 0. Hence there is no Stein cobordism from ξ to

(1) any contact structure supported by a planar open book,
(2) any contact structure on the link of a rational singularity, or
(3) any contact structure with vanishing Ozsv´ath-Szab´o invariant.

In the course of proving this theorem we give an explicit method to detect the
contact invariant c+(ξ) in the homology of graded roots of A. N´emethi, if ξ satisﬁes
a certain compatibility condition with a plumbing graph.

To detect c+(ξ) in the homology of graded roots, one should understand the

isomorphism

(1.1)

Φ : HF +(−M (Γ), tcan) → H(Rτ ).
Here the left side is the Heegaard Floer homology of the 3-manifold described via
an AR-plumbing graph Γ in the canonical Spinc structure tcan. The right side is the

homology of a graded root Rτ , which is much easier to compute. In Section 5 we
describe the isomorphism Φ explicitly along with the required algebraic objects, tell
how c+ is detected in graded roots and ﬁnally prove Theorem 1.2. In Section 6 we
present explicit examples.

2. Contact Preliminaries

In this section we mention some background material about contact geometry.
Our main purpose is to set up our terminology. For a thorough discussion see
[27, 12, 7].

Contact structures on 3-manifolds can be studied topologically via open books
through the Giroux corespondence. We say that a contact structure ξ on M is
compatible with an open book in M if on the oriented binding of the open book
a contact form of ξ is a positive volume form and away from the binding ξ can be
isotoped through contact structures to be arbitrarily close to the tangent planes of
the pages of the open book. Giroux correspondence states that this compatibility
relation is in fact a one-to-one correspondence between contact 3-manifolds up to
contact isotopy and open books up to positive stabilizations.

Suppose (W, J) is a compact complex surface with oriented boundary −M1 ∪ M2
that admits a strictly plurisubharmonic Morse function φ : W → [t1, t2] such that
Mi = φ−1(ti), for i = 1, 2, and −dJ ∗dφ is a symplectic form. Then the set of
complex tangencies on Mi constitute a contact structure ξi, for i = 1, 2. In this case
we say that W is a Stein cobordism from (M1, ξ1) to (M2, ξ2). If M1 = ∅ we say
that W is a Stein ﬁlling for (M2, ξ2).

Establishing the existence of a Stein cobordism between given contact manifolds
is a delicate problem. Etnyre and Honda proved that an overtwisted contact 3-
manifold is Stein cobordant to any contact 3-manifold and that for any contact
3-manifold M there is a Stein ﬁllable one to which M is Stein cobordant [10]. The
obstructions usually utilize Floer type theories. The ﬁrst author used Heegaard
Floer homology to prove non-existence of Stein cobordisms between certain con-
tact manifolds [16]; see also Sections 5 and 6 below. Another powerful tool which
obstructs more generally exact symplectic cobordisms is Latschev and Wendl’s al-
gebraic torsion which was built in the framework of symplectic ﬁeld theory [18]. In
the appendix of the same paper Hutchings described the same obstruction in em-
bedded contact homology. Translation of the latter in the Heegaard Floer setting
was recently given by Kutluhan et al [17].

Starting with a contact 3-manifold (M1, ξ1) we can build a Stein cobordism as
follows. First take the product M1 × [0, 1] and equip it with the standard Stein
structure. Then attach 1-handles to the upper boundary. Next attach 2-handles
along Legendrian knots in M1♯nS1 × S2 with framing one less than the contact
framing. By the topological characterization of Stein cobordisms given by Eliashberg
[9], see also [13, Theorem 1.3], the standard Stein structure on M1 × [0, 1] extends
uniquely over such handles and all Stein cobordisms can be constructed this way.
We are going to need a well-known partial translation of this recipe in terms of open
books.

Lemma 2.1. There exists a Stein cobordism from (M1, ξ1) to (M2, ξ2) if there exist
open books (Si, φi) compatible with (Mi, ξi) for i = 1, 2, such that S1 and S2 are
homeomorphic surfaces and φ2 is obtained by multiplying φ1 with right handed Dehn
twists along non-separating curves.

4

C¸ A ˘GRI KARAKURT AND FER˙IT ¨OZT ¨URK

Proof. By Legendrian realization principle [14, Theorem 3.7], each non-separating
curve on a page can be isotoped to a Legendrian curve staying on the same page such
that the page framing and the contact framing agree. Then adding right handed
Dehn twists to the monodromy along these curves precisely corresponds to adding
(cid:3)
a Stein handle along the Legendrian curves.

3. Preliminaries on Plumbings

Let Γ be a weighted connected tree with vertices {bj : j ∈ J } for some ﬁnite index
set J . Let ej denote the weight of the jth vertex bj for all j ∈ J . We construct
a 4-manifold X(Γ) as follows: For each vertex bj, take a disk bundle over a sphere
whose Euler number is ej and plumb two of these together whenever there is an edge
connecting the vertices. We denote the boundary 3-manifold by M (Γ). We shall call
such a graph a plumbing graph. These graphs naturally arise in singularity theory
as good dual resolution graphs where vertices correspond to exceptional divisors and
the edges represent their intersection. See [23] for a survey on this topic.

3.1. The lattices L and L′. The 4-manifold X(Γ) admits a handle decomposition
without 1-handles, so the second homology group L = H2(X(Γ); Z) is freely gener-
ated by the the fundamental classes of the zero-sections of the disk bundles in the
plumbing construction. Hence we have a generator of L for each vertex of Γ. By
abuse of notation we denote the generator in L corresponding to the vertex bj by
the same symbol. The intersection form (·, ·) on L is a symmetric bilinear function
naturally characterized by Γ.

It is known that a plumbing graph can be realized as a good dual resolution graph
of a singularity if and only if the intersection form is negative deﬁnite. Henceforth,
we shall assume that all the plumbing graphs we consider satisfy this property.
Therefore L is a lattice and we have the short exact sequence

P D

(3.1)
where L′ is the dual lattice HomZ(L, Z) ∼= H 2(X(Γ); Z) ∼= H2(X(Γ), M (Γ); Z) with
P D(x) = (x, ·), and H = H1(M (Γ); Z) .

−−−−→ L′ −−−−→ H −−−−→ 0

0 −−−−→ L

We say that k ∈ L′ is characteristic if for every vertex bj of Γ, we have k(bj)+ej ≡
0 mod 2. Let Char(Γ) denote the set of characteristic elements in L′. The lattice L
naturally acts on Char(Γ) by the rule x ∗ k = k + 2P D(x) for every x ∈ L.

The characteristic cohomology class K ∈ L′ satisfying K(bj) = −ej − 2 for all
j ∈ J is called the canonical class. For each k ∈ Char(Γ), we deﬁne the function
χk : L → Z by

(3.2)

χk(x) = −(k(x) + (x, x))/2.

We simply use the symbol χ to denote χK .

3.2. Spinc structures. Every element of Char(Γ) uniquely deﬁnes a Spinc structure
on X(Γ). Two such Spinc structures induce the same Spinc structure on M (Γ) if
and only if the corresponding characteristic cohomology classes are in the same L-
orbit. For a ﬁxed Spinc structure t of M (Γ), let Char(Γ, t) denote the set of all
characteristic cohomology classes which restrict to t on M (Γ). Since M (Γ) is a
rational homology sphere, it has ﬁnitely many Spinc structures; these are in one-to-
one correspondence with elements of H1(M (Γ), Z). We can express Char(Γ) as a
disjoint union of ﬁnitely many Char(Γ, t)s. In this paper, the default Spinc structure,
denoted by tcan, is the one induced by the canonical class K.

3.3. Almost Rational Graphs. A plumbing graph Γ is said to be rational
if
χ(x) ≥ 1 for any x > 0. Call a vertex bj in a plumbing graph a bad vertex if −ej is
greater than the valency of the vertex. It is known that graphs with no bad vertices
are rational. Moreover, rational graphs are closed under decreasing weights and
taking subgraphs.

A graph is said to be almost rational (or AR for short) if by decreasing the weight
of a vertex b0, we get a rational graph. Note that such a distinguished vertex b0
need not be unique. Graphs with at most one bad vertex are AR [25, Section 8]. In
particular plumbing graphs of Seifert ﬁbered rational homology spheres are AR. A
plumbing graph is said to be proper almost rational if it is almost rational but not
rational.

We say that a surface singularity is rational (respectively, AR and proper AR)
if it admits a good resolution graph which is rational (respectively AR and proper
AR). For example, for pairwise relatively prime integers p, q and r, the link of the
Brieskorn singularity

(3.3)

xp + yq + zr = 0,

is a Seifert ﬁbered integral homology sphere which is called Brieskorn sphere Σ(p, q, r).
Such a singularity is proper AR unless (p, q, r) = (2, 3, 5) [35, 8, 25].

4. Construction of Stein Cobordisms

The purpose of this section is to prove Theorem 1.1. In fact we will show that
the proper AR-singularity in the theorem can be chosen as a Brieskorn singularity.
For arbitrary positive integers g and n, consider the triple (p, q, r) with

p = 2,

q = 2g + 1, and r = (4g + 2)n + 1.

Note that p, q, and r are pairwise relatively prime for all g and n, so the correspond-
ing Brieskorn sphere Σ(p, q, r) is an integral homology sphere, and the corresponding
Brieskorn singularity is proper AR.

We shall describe an abstract open book which supports the canonical contact
structure on Σ(p, q, r). Let Sg denote a compact orientable surface of genus g with
one boundary component. Let φg,n denote the diﬀeomorphism on Sg which is a
product of right handed Dehn twists along simple closed curves given by

(4.1)

φg,n = (ta1 ta2 . . . ta2g )(4g+2)n+1,

where the curves a1, a2, . . . , a2g form a chain as in Figure 1

Figure 1. Curves a1, . . . a2g which form a chain on Sg.

The chain relation [11, Proposition 4.12] tells that

(4.2)

(ta1ta2 . . . ta2g )(4g+2) = tδ

6

C¸ A ˘GRI KARAKURT AND FER˙IT ¨OZT ¨URK

where δ is a simple closed curve on Sg which is parallel to the boundary component.
Since δ does not intersect with any of a1, . . . , a2g, the Dehn twist tδ commutes with
all of ta1, . . . , ta2g . Hence φg,n can also be written as
φg,n = (ta1ta2 . . . ta2g )tn
δ

Lemma 4.1. The canonical contact structure on Σ(p, q, r) is supported by (Sg, φg,n).

Proof. Consider the Milnor ﬁber M (p, q, r) of the singularity (3.3). By deﬁnition we
have ∂M (p, q, r) = Σ(p, q, r). We shall construct a holomorphic Lefschetz ﬁbration
on M (p, q, r) whose ﬁbers are diﬀeomorphic to Sg and monodromy factorizes exactly
as in (4.1). Our argument will be based on a work of Loi and Piergallini [21], which
relates branched covers of Stein 4-manifolds to Lefschetz ﬁbrations.

Since p = 2, the Milnor ﬁber M (p, q, r) is a 2-fold branched cover of B4 = {(y, z) ∈
|y|2 + |z|2 ≤ ǫ}, branched along the Milnor ﬁber M (q, r) of the plane curve

C2 :
singularity

(4.3)

yq + zr = 0

Let h : M (p, q, r) → B4 be the covering map. It is well known that the link of the
plane curve singularity (4.3) is the (q, r)-torus knot T (q, r) in S3 = ∂B4, and the
Milnor ﬁber M (q, r) is diﬀeomorphic to the minimal genus Seifert surface of T (q, r)
in S3. Identify B4 ∼= B2 × B2 using the complex coordinates (y, z) and consider the
projection map to the second factor π2 : B4 → B2. The restriction of this map to
M (q, r) is a simple q-fold branched covering whose singular points, called the twist
points, are in one-to-one correspondence with crossings of T (q, r) represented as a
braid with q strands and r twists. Here it is important that all the crossings of
T (q, r) are positive otherwise charts describing simple branched cover around the
twist points would not be compatible with the complex orientation on M (q, r). Let
s1, s2, . . . , sqr be the twist points on M (q, r). Without loss of generality we may
assume that they are mapped to distinct points z1, z2, . . . , zr under π2. By [21,
Proposition 1], the composition f := π2 ◦ h is a holomorphic Lefschetz ﬁbration
whose set of singular values is {z1, z2, . . . , zr}.

Next we determine the regular ﬁbers of the Lefschetz ﬁbration f : M (p, q, r) →
B2. Away from the twist points, any disk B2 × {pt} in B4 intersects M (q, r) at
q points. Since q = 2g + 1, each such disk lifts under h to a genus g surface F
with one boundary component; this forms a regular ﬁber of f . The restriction map
h|F : F → B2 × {pt} is modeled by taking the quotient of F by the hyperelliptic
involution whose 2g + 1 ﬁxed points map to B2 × {pt} ∩ M (q, r). See the marked
points on F in Figure 2.

When a disk B2 × {pt} intersects M (q, r) at a twist point, its lift under h is a
singular ﬁber of f . We can describe the vanishing cycle of each singular ﬁber using
the corresponding crossing of T (q, r). Any arc γ on B2×{pt} connecting two strands
of the braid T (q, r) lifts to a unique simple closed curve α on the regular ﬁber F .
In Figure 2, we indicated these arcs and curves using diﬀerent colors. If a crossing
exchanges these two strands connected by γ then the corresponding singular ﬁber
has vanishing cycle α. Each such vanishing cycle contributes a right handed Dehn
twist along α if the corresponding crossing is positive (see [21, Proposition 1] or
[3, Lemma 4.2]). Following the braid direction we see that the monodromy is as
described in (4.1).

Having shown that the ﬁbers of f are diﬀeomorphic to Sg and the total mon-
odromy of f agrees with φg,n, we conclude that the restriction of f on ∂M (p, q, r)

is the open book (Sg, φg,n). Since the ﬁbers of f are complex submanifolds of
(cid:3)
M (p, q, r), the open book (Sg, φg,n) supports the canonical contact structure.

Remark 4.2. An alternative proof of the above lemma goes as follows: Using han-
dlebody techniques and the fact that Σ(p, q, pqn + 1) is −1/n surgery on (p, q)-torus
knot, one can directly verify that the total space of the open book (Sg, φg,n) is
Σ(2, 2g + 1, (2g + 1)n + 1). Using the chain relation and a result of W. D. Neumann
and A. Pichon [26, Theorem 2.1], one can show that the open book supports the
canonical contact structure.

Lemma 4.3. Given any contact 3-manifold (M, ξ), there exist g, n0 ∈ N such that
for every n ≥ n0 there is a Stein cobordism from (M, ξ) to the canonical contact
structure on the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2, 2g + 1, (2g + 1)n + 1).

Proof. Take an open book supporting (M, ξ). If the pages of this open book have
more than one boundary component, we can positively stabilize the open book to
reduce the number of boundary components to one at the expense of increasing
the page genus. Let g denote the genus of the pages of the resulting open book
after the stabilizations. Fix an identiﬁcation of the pages with Sg, let φ denote the
monodromy.

Write the monodromy as a product of Dehn twists about non-separating curves

c1, c2, . . . , ck in Sg,

(4.4)

φ = tǫ1

c1tǫ2

c2 · · · tǫk

ck, where ǫi ∈ {−1, +1} for all i = 1, . . . , k

The exponents in the above equation emphasize that the factorization φ can contain
both right handed and left handed Dehn twists. We shall make the monodromy agree
with φg,n0 for some large n0 ∈ N by multiplying it by only right handed Dehn twists.
If ǫ1 = −1 we simply multiply φ by tc1 from left to cancel the ﬁrst term. If ǫ1 = +1,
we need to do more work! Since c1 is non-separating, a self-diﬀeomorphism ψ of Sg
sends a2g to c1 (see Figure 1). Multiply both sides of the chain relation (4.2) by
ψ−1 from right and by ψ from left, and use the fact that tδ is in the center of the
mapping class group of Sg, to see that

(tψ(a1)tψ(a2) . . . tψ(a2g ))(4g+2) = tδ.

8

C¸ A ˘GRI KARAKURT AND FER˙IT ¨OZT ¨URK

Hence using (4g + 2)(2g) − 1 right handed Dehn twists we can trade tc1 with tδ. The
latter can be put at the end of the factorization (4.4). Applying the same recipe to
the remaining ci’s we get the monodromy tn0
δ , where n0 is the number of positive
exponents appearing in the factorization (4.4). By adding Dehn twists appearing in
the left hand side of the chain relation (4.2) as many times as necessary, we get the
monodromy agree with φg,n for any n ≥ n0.

During the process we made only two kinds of modiﬁcations on the open book:
positive stabilizations and adding a right handed Dehn twist to the monodromy. By
(cid:3)
Lemma 2.1 the required Stein cobordism exists.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Immediately follows from Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.3.

5. Heegaard Floer homology, graded roots and Stein cobordism

obstructions

To understand the image of c+(ξ) under Φ in (1.1), we analyze the isomorphism

Φ carefully by considering its factorization as follows:

Φ

−−−−→ (K+(Γ))∗

Φ2−−−−→ H(Rτ )

In order to introduce the notation and recall the deﬁnitions, we recite brieﬂy the
construction of HF +, H+, K+, and the isomorphisms Φ1 and
Φ in Sections 5.1-5.3
and the graded roots, their homology and the isomorphism Φ2 in Sections 5.4-5.5.
We describe how to detect root vertices of graded roots in (K +(Γ))∗ in Section 5.6
and distinguish the contact invariant in (K +(Γ))∗ in Section 5.7. Finally we prove
Theorem 1.2 in Section 5.8.

5.1. Plus ﬂavor of Heegaard Floer homology. Heegaard Floer theory is a pack-
age of prominent invariants for 3-manifolds, [32, 31] see also [15, 22] for recent sur-
veys. To every closed and oriented 3-manifold M , and any Spinc structure t on
M , one associates an F := Z/2Z-vector space HF +(M, t) which admits a canoni-
cal Z/2Z grading. In the case that the ﬁrst Chern class of the Spinc structure is
torsion (in particular when M is a rational homology sphere), the Z/2Z-grading
lifts to an absolute Q-grading. There is also an endomorphism, denoted by U , de-
creasing the degree by 2 so as to make HF +(M, t) an F[U ]-module. For example
when the 3-manifold is the 3-sphere and t0 is its unique Spinc structure, we have
HF +(S3, t0) = T +
0 where T + stands for the F[U ]-module F[U, U −1]/U F[U ] and T +
d
denotes the one in which the lowest degree element is supported in degree d. More
generally when M is a rational homology sphere, it is known that the Heegaard
d ⊕ HFred(M, t) where HFred(M, t) is a
Floer homology is given by HF +(M, t) = T +
ﬁnitely generated F-vector space (and hence a ﬁnitely generated F[U ]-module) [29].
In the sequel, we shall assume that all our 3-manifolds are rational 3-spheres.

Heegaard Floer homology groups behave functorially under cobordisms in the
following sense: Suppose M1 and M2 are connected, closed and oriented 3-manifolds
and there is a cobordism W from M1 to M2; i.e. the oriented boundary of W is
∂W = (−M1) ∪ M2. For every Spinc structure s on W , let t1 and t2 denote the
induced Spinc structures on M1 and M2 respectively. Then we have an F[U ]-module
homomorphism

FW,s : HF +(−M2, t2) → HF +(−M1, t1).

5.2. The graded module H+(Γ). The diﬀerential in the chain complex deﬁning
Heegaard Floer homology counts certain types of holomorphic disks. This aspect
makes the computation of Heegaard Floer homology groups diﬃcult in general. On
the other hand if a three manifold arises from a plumbing construction, there is a
purely algebraic description for its Heegaard Floer homology.

Let Γ be a negative deﬁnite plumbing graph. For every Spinc structure t of M (Γ),
let H+(Γ, t) be the subset of the set of functions Hom(Chart(Γ), T +) satisfying the
following property. For every k ∈ Chart(Γ) and every j ∈ J , let n be the integer
deﬁned by

(5.2)

χk,j = χk(bj) = −(k(bj) + ej)/2.

Then for every positive integer m, we require

U m−χk,j φ(k + 2P D(bj)) = U mφ(k) whenever χk,j ≤ 0, and

U mφ(k + 2P D(bj)) = U m+χk,j φ(k) whenever χk,j > 0.

L

t H+(Γ, t), which has readily an F[U ]-module structure.
We deﬁne H+(Γ) =
Moreover the conditions above provide the existence of a suitable grading on it.
A map Φ1 : HF +(−M (Γ), t) → H+(Γ, t) can be described as follows: Remove
X from −M (Γ)
a disk from the 4-manifold X(Γ) and regard it as a cobordism
to S3. For each characteristic cohomology class k ∈ Chart(Γ) we have a map
F eX,k : HF +(−M (Γ), t) → HF +(S3) = T +
0 . For any Heegaard Floer homology
class c ∈ HF +(−M (Γ)) and for any characteristic cohomology class k, we deﬁne
Φ1(c)(k) := F eX,k(c). Thanks to adjunction relations, this map is a well deﬁned
homomorphism which is in fact an isomorphism when Γ is AR. This was shown by
Ozsv´ath and Szab´o for the special case where Γ has at most one bad vertex [30] and
later by N´emethi in general [25].

5.3. The dual of H+(Γ). There is a simple description of the dual of H+(Γ). We
use the notation U m⊗k to denote a typical element of Z≥0×Char(Γ, t). The elements
of the form U 0 ⊗ k are simply indicated by k. Deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼ on
Z≥0 × Char(Γ, t) by the following rule. Let j ∈ J and n be as in (5.2). Then we
require

U m+n ⊗ (k + 2P D(bj)) ∼ U m ⊗ k if n ≥ 0,

and

U m ⊗ (k + 2P D(bj)) ∼ U m−n ⊗ k if n < 0.
Let K+(Γ, t) denote the set of equivalence classes. Let (K+(Γ, t))∗ denote its dual.
For any non-negative integer l, let Ker U l+1 denote the subgroup of H+(Γ, t) which
is the kernel of the multiplication by U l+1. The map

5.4. Graded roots. Let R be an inﬁnite tree. Denote its vertex set and edge set
by V(R) and E(R) respectively. Let χ : V(R) → Z satisfy the following properties.

(1) χ(u) − χ(v) = ±1, if [u, v] ∈ E(R).
(2) χ(u) > min{χ(v), χ(w)}, if [u, v] ∈ E(R), and [u, w] ∈ E(R).
(3) χ is bounded below.
(4) χ−1(n) is a ﬁnite set for every n.
(5) |χ−1(n)| = 1 for n large enough.

Such a pair (R, χ) is called a graded root. When the grading function χ is apparent
in the discussion we simply drop it from our notation and use R to denote a graded
root.

Next we describe a particular graded root produced by a function τ : Z≥0 → Z
that is non-decreasing after a ﬁnite index. For each i ∈ Z>0 consider the graded
tree Ri with vertices {vm
]}m≥τ (i) with grading
χ(vm

j , vn+1

To each graded root (R, χ) as above, with vertex set V and edge set E, one can
associate a graded F[U ] module H(R, χ) as follows. As a set, H(R, χ) is the set of
functions φ : V → T +
0

satisfying

(5.3)

U · φ(u) = φ(v),

whenever [u, v] ∈ E with χ(u) < χ(v). The U -action on H(R, χ) is deﬁned by the
rule (U · φ)(v) = U (φ(v)). The grading on H(R, χ) is deﬁned in the following way.
An element φ ∈ H(R, χ) is homogeneous of degree d if for every v ∈ V, φ(v) is
homogeneous of degree d − 2χ(v).

5.5. Laufer sequences. To simplify our discussion we will work with the canonical
Spinc structure from now on; some of the discussion below works for a general
Spinc structure, though. Our aim is to describe the isomorphism

Φ2 : (K+(Γ, tcan))∗ → H(Rτ ),

discovered by N´emethi, in a slightly diﬀerent setup which suits to our needs; what
we do below is nothing but rephrasing the ﬁndings in [25]. Now, the isomorphism
Φ2 is induced by a bijection between the dual objects:
Φ3 : V(Rτ ) → K+(Γ, tcan).

Here Rτ is a graded root associated to a τ function and V(Rτ ) is its vertex set. We
now describe the construction of the function τ .

Recursively form a sequence (k(i))∞

i=0 in Char(Γ, tcan) as follows: start with the
canonical class k(0) = K. Suppose k(i) has already been constructed. We ﬁnd
k(i + 1) using the algorithm below.

(1) We construct a computational sequence z0, z1, · · · zl. Let z0 = k(i)+2PD(b0).

Suppose zm has been found. If there exists j ∈ J − {0} such that

zm(bj) = −ej

then we let zm+1 = zm + 2PD(bj).

(2) If there is no such j, stop. Set l = m and k(i + 1) = zl.

11

The sequence (k(i))∞
i=0 is called the Laufer sequence of the AR graph Γ associated
with the canonical Spinc structure. This sequence depends on the choice of the
distinguished vertex b0 but is independent from our choice of vertices in step 1 of
the above algorithm. Deﬁne χi,0 = χk(i)(b0). Note that since the elements of each
computational sequence described above satisfy zm ∼ zm+1 for every m = 0, . . . , l−1,
the vectors k(i) satisfy the following relations in K+(Γ, tcan):
U χi,0 ⊗ k(i) ∼ k(i + 1) if χi,0 ≥ 0, and
k(i) ∼ U −χi,0 ⊗ k(i + 1) if χi,0 < 0.

P

n−1
Let τ (n) =
i=0 χi,0, with τ (0) = 0. It can be shown that there exists an index
N such that τ (i + 1) ≥ τ (i) for all i ≥ N [25, Theorem 9.3(a)]. Hence τ deﬁnes a
graded root Rτ and indices beyond N do not give essential information about Rτ .
Moreover, for the canonical Spinc structure, τ (N ) ≥ 2 and τ (i) ≤ 1 for all i ≤ N − 1
[25, Theorem 6.1(d)]. In that case one can stop the computation procedure of the
Laufer sequence once τ ≥ 2. Now with a little eﬀort, one can observe in that the map
i ) = U m−τ (i) ⊗ k(i) (after the proofs of [25,
Φ3 : V(Rτ ) → K+(Γ) is deﬁned by Φ3(vm
Theorem 9.3(b)] and [25, Proposition 4.7]). One can check that Φ3 is well deﬁned
and injective and moreover Φ3 is in fact a bijection so it induces an F[U ]-module
isomorphism Φ2 : (K+(Γ))∗ → H(Rτ ), which shifts grading by (K 2 + |J |)/4

Remark 5.1. The Laufer sequence {x(i)} in [25] resides in L while {k(i)} here resides
in Char(Γ, tcan). These two Laufer sequences are related by

k(i) = K + 2P D(x(i)).

Remark 5.2. The sequence (τ (i))∞
i=0 contains a lot of redundant elements. The ﬁnite
subsequence (τ (ni)) consisting of local maximum and local minimum values of τ is
suﬃcient to construct the graded root.

Remark 5.3. An algorithm similar to what we have described above can be utilized to
compute the Heegaard Floer homology groups for an arbitrary Spinc structure t. The
only new necessary input is the distinguished representative of the Spinc structure
inside Char(Γ, t). Interested reader can consult [25, Section 5].

5.6. Detecting root vertices. Ozsv´ath and Szab´o used a variation of the above
algorithm to determine KerU in (K+(Γ))∗ [30, Section 3.1]. Their elements are also
visible in the Laufer sequence. In a graded root R, say that a vertex is a root vertex
if it has valency 1. The following lemma identiﬁes root vertices of Rτ with elements
of KerU .

Lemma 5.4. Given k ∈ K+(Γ, tcan) such that k∗ ∈ KerU , there exists an element
k(i0) of the Laufer sequence such that k ∼ k(i0). This element is unique in the
following sense: if k(i0) ∼ k(i1) ∼ k and i0 < i1 then τ (i) = τ (i0) for all i satisfying
i0 ≤ i ≤ i1. As a result Φ−1
3 (k) is the root vertex of the branch in the graded root
Rτ corresponding to τ (i0).
Proof. Since Φ3 is surjective, k ∼ U n ⊗ k(i0) for some i0, n ∈ Z≥0. Since k∗ is
in KerU , k does not admit any representation of the form U n ⊗ k′ unless n = 0.
Then the vertex vτ (i0)
in the graded root Rτ must have valency 1 since otherwise
vτ (i0)
i0 ≍ vτ (i)+m
for some i, m ∈ Z≥0, implying that k ∼ U m ⊗ k(i), a case which we
have dismissed. The same argument proves that τ must be constant between i0 and
(cid:3)
i1 if k(i0) ∼ k(i1) ∼ k.

Lemma 5.5. If k ∈ Char(Γ, tcan) satisﬁes

ej + 2 ≤ k(bj) ≤ −ej − 2, for all j ∈ J ,
then k∗ ∈ KerU and there exists a unique i0 ∈ Z≥0 such that k = k(i0). Consequently
Φ−1
3 (k) is the root vertex of the branch in the graded root Rτ corresponding to τ (i0).
Moreover, the index i0 is the component of the vector PD−1(k(i0) − K)/2 on b0.

Proof. By [30, Proposition 3.2], k forms a good full path of length 1 so it does not
admit any representation of the form U n ⊗ k′ with n ≥ 1, and it is the only element
in its ∼ equivalence class. By Lemma 5.4, we must have k = k(i0) for some element
k(i0) of the Laufer sequence. The claim about the index is in fact satisﬁed by every
(cid:3)
element of the Laufer sequence [25, Lemma 7.6 (a)].

5.7. Contact invariant. To any co-oriented contact structure ξ on a 3-manifold
M , one associates an element c+(ξ) ∈ HF +(−M ). This element is an invariant of
the contact structure and it satisﬁes the following properties:

(1) c+(ξ) lies in the summand HF +(−M, tξ) where tξ is the Spinc structure

uniquely determined by the homotopy class of ξ.

(2) c+(ξ) is homogeneous of degree −d3(ξ)−1/2, where d3(ξ) is the 3-dimensional

invariant of ξ of Gompf [13].
(3) When ξ is overtwisted, c+(ξ) = 0.
(4) When ξ is Stein ﬁllable c+(ξ) 6= 0.
(5) We have U (c+(ξ)) = 0.
(6) c+(ξ) is natural under Stein cobordisms.
Our aim is to understand where the contact invariant falls under the isomorphism
described in (5.1). This could be diﬃcult for a general contact structure. We need
a certain type of compatibility of the contact structure with the plumbing.

Deﬁnition 5.6. Let Γ be a plumbing graph. Suppose ξ is a contact structure on
M (Γ). We say that ξ is compatible with Γ if the following are satisﬁed:

(1) The contact structure ξ admits a Stein ﬁlling whose total space, possibly after

ﬁnitely many blow-ups, is X(Γ).

(2) The induced Spinc structure agrees with that of the canonical class on M (Γ).
(This condition is automatically satisﬁed when M (Γ) is an integral homology
sphere.)

Note that canonical contact structures of singularities are compatible with the
dual resolution graphs. Furthermore if ξ is compatible with Γ then X(Γ) is a strong
symplectic ﬁlling for ξ. We shall denote by J and c1(J), the corresponding almost
complex structure on X(Γ) and its ﬁrst Chern class respectively.

Theorem 5.7. ([16, Proposition 1.2]) Let ξ be compatible with Γ. Then we have
Φ ◦ Φ1(c+(ξ)) = (c1(J))∗.

Proof. If X(Γ) has no −1 spheres, the total space of the Stein ﬁlling is X(Γ) itself.

Then result is an easy consequence of the deﬁnitions of the maps Φ1 and

if k ∼ c1(J),
if k 6∼ c1(J).

In the case that X(Γ) contains −1 spheres, we blow them down until we get
a Stein ﬁlling of ξ. Applying Plamenevskaya’s theorem there and using blow-up
(cid:3)
formulas we see that (5.4) still holds.

Corollary 5.8. We have

Φ ◦ Φ1(c+(ξcan)) = K ∗ where K is the canonical class.

e

Φ ◦ Φ1(c+(ξcan)) = K ∗ where K
5.8. Proof of Theorem 1.2. By Corollary 5.8,
is the canonical class which is also the ﬁrst element k(0) of the Laufer sequence.
Under the correspondence described in Lemma 5.4, this element is associated with
the root vertex of the branch of τ (0). We will be done once we prove this branch
has length one, which implies that Φ(c+(ξcan)) is not in the image of U n for any
n > 0. Since Φ is an F[U ] module isomorphism, the same must hold for c+(ξcan).

e

By deﬁnition, τ (0) = 0, and a direct computation shows τ (1) = 1. Now, by
[25, Theorem 6.1(d)] it follows that #τ −1(m) = 1 whenever m ≥ 1; equivalently
if τ (n) > 1 for some n then τ is increasing beyond n. Then we have two cases:
either τ is always increasing or there is some n for which τ (n) < 1 and τ (j) = 1 for
1 ≤ j ≤ n. In the former case we get H(Rτ ) = T +
0 . However this is equivalent to
having Γ rational ([25, Theorem 6.3]), which we have dismissed by assumption. In
the latter case, there are more than one root of the tree Rτ which have non-positive
degree. In particular the branch corresponding τ (0) has length 1 (as illustrated in
Figure 3), and therefore we have σ(ξ) = 0.

Figure 3. If Γ is proper AR, this tree embeds into the graded root
R where the red vertex is identiﬁed with τ (0).

Finally, there can be no Stein cobordism from (M (Γ), ξ) to (M ′, η) if σ(η) < 0.
This follows from the naturality of the invariant c+ under Stein cobordisms and the
fact that the invariant σ increases under a Stein cobordism [16, Theorem 1.5]. To
ﬁnish the proof we recall that for each of the cases in the theorem, σ(η) = −∞: this
is immediate if c+(ξ) = 0; for the case η is a planar contact structure, this claim
is just [28, Theorem 1.2]; for the case when M ′ is the link of a rational singularity,
✷
this is a consequence of [25, Theorem 6.3].

6. Examples

The main result of our paper concerns canonical contact structures but with the
techniques we developed in this paper we can in fact compute the σ invariant of any
contact structure which is compatible with an AR plumbing graph. Here we give a
few examples.

6.1. Contact structures on Σ(2, 3, 11). We start with a simple but an instructive
example. The Brieskorn sphere Σ(2, 3, 11) is the boundary of the graph in Figure 4
which we denote by Γ. We index the vertices {b0, b1, . . . , b8} of Γ so that b0 is the
one with adjacency 3 and b8 is the one with weight −3. We know that Γ is proper
AR since (2, 3, 11) are pairwise relatively prime.

One may ﬁnd compatible Stein structures on the 4-manifold X(Γ) by choosing
the Legendrian attaching circles of 2-handles corresponding to vertices with the
prescribed intersection matrix such that the smooth framing is one less than the
Thurston-Bennequin framing. Note that there is a unique way of doing this for each
(−2)-framed vertex, but the (−3)-framed 2-handle can be Legendrian realized in
two diﬀerent ways. We ﬁx an orientation on this vertex and distinguish these two
cases according to their rotation numbers [20, Theorem 1.2]. Hence X(Γ) has two
natural distinct Stein structures whose Chern classes are k± = [0, . . . , 0, ±1] where
we write an element k ∈ H 2(X(Γ), Z) in the form [k(b1), . . . , k(bs)] in the dual basis.
Denote the corresponding contact structures on boundary ξ±.

Figure 5. Stein handlebody pictures of ξ±.

The Heegaard Floer homology of Σ(2, 3, 11) is well known; we can readily compute
it here by considering the Laufer sequence k(n) and the corresponding values τ (n).
Moreover from Lemma 5.5, we know that k± will appear in the Laufer sequence.
The ﬁrst several k(n) and τ (n) are as follows:

k+ = k(0) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1),

k(1) = (2, −2, 0, −2, 0, 0, 0, 0, −3),

k(2) = (2, 0, −2, 0, 0, 0, 0, −2, −1),

k(3) = (2, −2, 0, 0, 0, 0, −2, 0, −1),

k(4) = (2, 0, 0, −2, 0, −2, 0, 0, −1),

k(5) = (4, −2, −2, 0, −2, 0, 0, 0, −1),

k− = k(6) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −1),

τ (0) = 0

τ (1) = 1

τ (2) = 1

τ (3) = 1

τ (4) = 1

τ (5) = 1

τ (6) = 0

Moreover it can be proven that τ (n + 1) ≥ τ (n) for every n ≥ 6. An indirect way
to do this is by observing that τ (13) = 2 and τ (n) = 1 for 7 ≤ n < 13 and then
employing [25, Theorem 6.1(d)] to conclude that τ is increasing for n ≥ 13. Hence
we obtain the graded root RτK as shown in Figure 6. By the previous discussion,
the contact invariants c+(ξ±) correspond to the two roots of the tree. As a result,
we have σ(ξ±) = 0. Notice that k+ = K, and so c+(ξ+) = c+(ξcan).

Finally we determine the Heegaard Floer homology by computing the homology of
the graded root and shifting the degree by (K 2+9)/4. We get that HF +(−Σ(2, 3, 11)) =
T +
(−2) ⊕ F(−2) and c+(ξ±) are two distinct elements of degree −2 which project non-
trivially to the reduced Floer homology.

plumbing graph Γn in Figure 7. For every m = 0, . . . , n − 1 we have the Stein
structure Jm corresponding to the Legendrian handle attachments along Legendrian
unknots corresponding to the vertices of Γn with framing tb − 1. In order to get the
correct framing we have to stabilize (−3)-and (−n − 1)-framed unknots once and
n−1 times respectively. To get the Stein structure Jm we do one left stabilization on
(−3)-framed unknot, and m right and n−m−1 left stabilizations on (−n−1)-framed
unknot see Figure 8. Orienting each unknot clockwise we ﬁx a basis for b0, . . . , b9n+5
for L using the indices as show in Figure 7. Then the number c1(Jm)(bj) is given by
the rotation number of the Legendrian unkot corresponding to the jth vertex. Hence
we have c1(Jm) = [0, 1, 0, 0, n − 2m − 1, 0, . . . , 0]. Clearly for every m = 0, . . . , n − 1,
the contact structure ξm induced by Jm is compatible with Γn. Hence by Lemma 5.5,
each c1(Jm) appears in the Laufer sequence of Γn. In fact we have c1(Jm) = k(im),
where im = 3m(9n + 2).

Lemma 6.1. [5, Propositon 4.2] Suppose p and q are relatively prime positive
integers. Let Sp,q be the semigroup of N generated by p and q including 0. Let
δ = (p − 1)(q − 1)/2. Consider the function τ : Z≥0 → Z associated to the Brieskorn
sphere Σ(p, q, pq − 1).

The function τ attains its local minima at at = t(pq − 1) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2δ − 2, and
local maxima at At = tpq + 1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2δ − 3. Moreover for any 0 ≤ t ≤ 2δ − 3,
one has

τ (At) − τ (at+1) = #{s 6∈ Sp,q : s ≥ n + 2} > 0,
τ (At) − τ (at) = #{s ∈ Sp,q : s ≤ n} > 0.

Applying the above lemma for the case p = 3 and q = 3n + 1, we see that
σ(ξm) = −m. Hence by choosing n and m appropriately we realize any negative
integer as the σ invariant of a contact structure. Of course ξm cannot be isomorphic
to the canonical contact structure unless m = 0. Therefore the following problem is
natural.

Question 6.2. Is it possible to realize any negative integer as the σ invariant of the
canonical contact structure of a singularity?
