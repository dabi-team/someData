Several other phenomena took place in connection with this event, such as low
coronal waves and a coronal mass ejection (CME). We analyze the association be-
tween the Moreton wave and the EUV signatures observed with the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These include their
low-coronal surface-imprint, and the signatures of the full wave and shock dome
propagating outward in the corona. We also study their relation to the white-
light CME. We perform a kinematic analysis by tracking the wavefronts in several
directions. This analysis reveals a high-directional dependence of accelerations
and speeds determined from data at various wavelengths. We speculate that
a region of open magnetic ﬁeld lines northward of our deﬁned radiant point
sets favorable conditions for the propagation of a coronal magnetohydrodynamic
shock in this direction. The hypothesis that the Moreton wavefront is produced
by a coronal shock-wave that pushes the chromosphere downward is supported
by the high compression ratio in that region. Furthermore, we propose a 3D
geometrical model to explain the observed wavefronts as the chromospheric and
low-coronal traces of an expanding and outward-traveling bubble intersecting
the Sun. The results of the model are in agreement with the coronal shock-wave
being generated by a 3D piston that expands at the speed of the associated
rising ﬁlament. The piston is attributed to the fast ejection of the ﬁlament –
CME ensemble, also consistent with the good match between the speed proﬁles
of the low-coronal and white-light shock-waves.

1. Introduction

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and ﬂares are the most energetic events that
occur in the solar atmosphere. Their eﬀects are detectable not only close to
the Sun, but also far into the interplanetary medium; they are key drivers of
space-weather conditions. CMEs and ﬂares can be observed separately or in
conjunction, and they are generally associated with large active regions (ARs)
with a complex magnetic ﬁeld structure. The inﬂuence of ﬂares and CMEs
on the solar atmosphere includes a wide ariety of phenomena, such as radio
bursts, accelerated particle beams, formation of transient coronal holes, shocks,
and large-scale propagating perturbations like Moreton and EUV waves among
others (Benz, 2008; Chen, 2011; Webb and Howard, 2012).

Globally propagating waves as a byproduct of ﬂares were ﬁrst explained by
Uchida (1968, 1973). Uchida’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model interpreted
the disturbances observed in Hα, which were discovered by Moreton (1960),
Moreton and Ramsey (1960), and Athay and Moreton (1961). These so-called
Moreton waves were observed in association with the most impulsive ﬂares as
arc-shaped fronts with a restricted angular span propagating with speeds of
500 – 1500 km s−1 to distances of up to 400 Mm. In Uchida’s model, a coronal
fast-mode MHD wave, or eventually a shock, originates within an AR, evolves
as a full 3D wave-dome out to the corona, and produces enhanced Hα emission

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

when it impacts and sweeps the chromosphere. Warmuth et al. (2001, 2004a,
2004b) (see also Warmuth (2015) and references therein) found that Moreton
perturbations slow down as they propagate, while their intensity proﬁles in Hα
decrease and broaden as they move away from their source. In their view, and
in agreement with Uchida’s model, this behavior could be explained by a freely
propagating fast-mode MHD shock created by a large-amplitude single pulse,
which might ﬁnally decay to an ordinary fast-mode MHD wave. The analysis of
numerical simulations by Vrˇsnak et al. (2016) addresses the necessary conditions
for an eruption to cause an observable Moreton wave and a coronal shock front,
with weaker eruptions producing only coronal and transition region signatures.
According to their results, the perturbation evolves as a freely propagating
simple wave after the initial eruption-driven phase.

Observational evidence of coronal waves in the EUV range was ﬁrst reported
by Moses et al. (1997) and Thompson et al. (1998) using data from the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT: Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995), onboard the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. These so-called EIT waves
seen on the solar disk show slower propagating speeds than Moreton waves, about
200 – 400 km s−1, and are visible for ≈ 45 – 60 min after the event that originates
them. The EUV fronts propagate almost radially from an AR, with a span of up
to 360◦, to distances beyond one solar radius. They are usually faint and diﬀuse
and weaken as they propagate. However, they are occasionally seen as an arc-like
sharp front, in which case they are called S-waves or brow waves (Warmuth, 2015
and references therein). Evidence of large-scale wavefronts has been also observed
in soft X-rays (see e.g. Khan and Aurass, 2002; Narukage et al. 2002, 2004;
Hudson et al., 2003). They are observed as arc-shaped emission enhancements,
are more homogeneous, and have sharper leading edges than those of EIT waves.
The discrepancy between Moreton- and EIT-wave speeds started a contro-
versy over years about the nature of EIT waves and their role as coronal coun-
terparts of the observable chromospheric phenomenon (see Warmuth (2015) and
references therein). This discrepancy led to suggestions that the two phenomena
were physically diﬀerent and propagated independently. Warmuth et al. (2001)
proposed that the mismatch in speeds might arise because Moreton waves are
always seen to decelerate, while the very low temporal cadence of EIT could lead
to an undersampling of the early stages of the wave propagation. These authors
also showed that Moreton- and EIT-wavefronts are nearly cospatial and have a
similar morphology, which strongly suggests that a single physical disturbance
could generate both.

A signiﬁcant observational progress resulted from the next generation of EUV
imagers with higher temporal cadence, such as the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager
(EUVI: Wuelser et al., 2004) onboard the two spacecraft of the Solar-Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO: Kaiser et al., 2008), the Sun Watcher us-
ing Active Pixel System Detectors and Image Processing (SWAP: Halain et al.,
2010, 2013; Seaton et al., 2013) onboard the Project for On-Board Autonomy 2
(PROBA2), and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012)
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and Cham-
berlin, 2012). The data provided by these imaging instruments have helped to
understand some long-standing problems about the nature of the EIT waves.

EUV waves have been observed with EUVI (e.g. Veronig, Temmer, and Vrˇsnak,
2008; Long et al., 2011; Warmuth and Mann, 2011) and AIA (e.g. Long,
DeLuca, and Gallagher, 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012). Recently,
the simultaneous existence of more than one type of EUV wave became evident
from observations taken with AIA. Asai et al. (2012) ﬁrst reported cotemporal
observations of EUV and Hα Moreton waves using SDO/AIA. They identiﬁed a
dome-shaped shock front expanding outward in the corona, which would produce
a sharp EUV front at low coronal heights and a Moreton wave intersecting the
chromosphere. They also observed a type II radio burst consistent with the shock
wavefront.

Observations of shock-wave domes evolving outward in the corona as pre-
dicted by Uchida’s model have previously been reported in a number of cases
(e.g. Narukage et al., 2004; Veronig et al., 2010; Kozarev et al., 2011; Ma et al.,
2011). Along these lines, 3D MHD numerical simulations performed by Selwa,
Poedts, and DeVore (2012) showed that twisted coronal magnetic loops can
evolve into an EUV wave, which forms a dome-shaped structure that propagates
in the corona after energy release in a ﬂare followed by a dimming. The EUV
wave propagates nearly isotropically on the disk and is able to produce the
observed low-coronal and chromospheric signatures.

The aforementioned large-scale EUV perturbations have been historically
named as EIT waves (see the review by Warmuth, 2015). In this article, to
avoid referring to a speciﬁc instrument name, we use the term EUV wave in
general. Moreover, we will distinguish, when needed, between their near-surface
imprints in the low corona (near-surface EUV wave) and the signatures of the
3D dome seen in projection (3D-dome EUV wave).

EUV waves are often referred to as fast and slow waves (Liu et al., 2010;
Ma et al., 2011; Chen and Wu, 2011; Liu and Ofman, 2014). The fast ones are
thought to be shock waves linked to chromospheric Moreton waves and coronal
soft X-ray waves (Asai et al., 2012; White, Balasubramaniam, and Cliver, 2014;
Cliver, 2013), while the slow ones could be real waves or belong to the category
of non-MHD traveling perturbations or pseudo waves (Warmuth, 2015). Some
authors suggest a third category of EUV waves, the hybrid ones, considering that
in some events multiple bright fronts can be observed in conjunction, with some
being true waves and others being pseudo waves (Patsourakos and Vourlidas,
2012).

The category of pseudo waves has been proposed by several authors who pro-
posed that EIT waves are the consequence of the magnetic ﬁeld reconﬁguration
during a CME eruption (see e.g. Delann´ee and Aulanier, 1999). The apparent
EIT wave is then the projection on the disk of an expanding CME envelope
or its footpoints. Depending on the global or surrounding magnetic topology,
propagating and stationary brightenings can be observed. Delann´ee and Aulanier
(1999) (see also Delann´ee, 2000; Delann´ee et al., 2008) proposed other non-wave
model for EIT disturbances, arguing that they would result from Joule heating
in electric-current shells during the opening of ﬁeld lines in a CME ejection.
Chen et al. (2002, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c) suggested that a propagating density
enhancement near the solar surface, which appears in numerical simulations of a
rising ﬂux rope due to the expansion of ﬁeld lines, is responsible for EIT waves;

SOLA: moreton.tex; 6 November 2018; 22:47; p. 4

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

while Moreton waves correspond to the faster shock front that is a consequence
of the ﬂux-rope radial acceleration. Attrill et al. (2007, 2009) proposed an al-
ternative mechanism to explain EUV-wave diﬀuse fronts; they argued that they
could be generated by propagating magnetic reconnections during the expansion
of CME ﬂanks.

Another long-standing problem is related to the origin of Moreton and as-
sociated coronal EUV waves and is described by the question of what drives
them: ﬂares or CMEs. It is also unclear whether it is even possible to distinguish
between these two drivers. Since CMEs and ﬂares are able to liberate enormous
amounts of energy in a short period of time, they can both be candidates to
produce strong shock-waves in the corona. During Moreton events, CMEs and
ﬂares appear to originate in the same AR and occur nearly simultaneously,
so that it is diﬃcult to discern which is primarily responsible for the coronal
shock wave and the chromospheric eﬀect. The characteristics of a shock wave
depend mainly on the 3D temporal piston that generates it (Vrˇsnak and Cliver,
2008). Moreton waves exhibit the characteristics of a blast wave, as mentioned
previously, i.e. a single shock that freely propagates and decays with time and
distance. A blast wave could be generated by a 3D piston in expansion acting
in a short time, as is the case of a pressure pulse caused by the ﬂare energy
deposition in the lower atmosphere. A 3D-piston driver acting for longer times
and expanding in all directions, as is the case of a CME, could supply energy in
a continuous way to the shock. As a consequence, the shock would evolve faster
than the piston, which would generate a supersonic wave, even in the case of a
subsonic driver. In this case the shock is expected to maintain the characteristic
shape of the driver. There are other diﬀerent types of 3D pistons, i.e. a rigid
body or an expanding blunt driver moving through the plasma and generating
a shock cone or a hyperbole-shaped surface (called bow shock), respectively.
The capability of a piston to generate a shock wave depends mostly on its
size and acceleration (Temmer et al., 2009), added to the characteristics of the
coronal medium in which it propagates. In this regard, a small and impulsively
accelerated driver is able to generate coronal shocks. Therefore, other phenomena
are candidates for generating globally propagating coronal waves, i.e. eruptive
ﬁlaments and small-scale ejecta (Warmuth, 2015, and references therein). Recent
multidirectional observations performed with STEREO and SDO showed a direct
relation between CMEs and EUV waves (see Patsourakos and Vourlidas, 2012,
and references therein). The CME and the wave, initially cospatial, decouple
after the initial stages of the CME evolution and the shock wave becomes a
freely propagating MHD wave. This suggests that in its ﬁrst steps the CME
expansion acts as a temporary 3D piston that drives the shock wave. In this
scenario, the CME bubble should follow the coronal wave expansion.

With the aim of contributing to the understanding of EUV waves, chromo-
spheric Moreton waves, and their sources, we present a detailed analysis of the
kinematics and directional characteristics of the wave event o 29 March 2014. An
X1.0 class ﬂare (SOL2014-03-29T17:48) occurred on that date in AR 12017 (N10
W32). This event was observed by several observatories from the ground and
by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS: De Pontieu et al., 2014),
SDO, STEREO, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager

(RHESSI: Lin et al., 2002), and Hinode (Kosugi et al., 2007). GOES soft X-ray
emission started to rise at around 17:35 UT and peaked at 17:48 UT. The ﬂare
was accompanied by a ﬁlament eruption, chromospheric and EUV waves, and a
CME. The morphology of the ﬂare onset and the magnetic ﬁeld structure have
been studied by Kleint et al. (2015) and Liu et al. (2015). The event began with
an asymmetric ﬁlament eruption, its western portion arched upward at ≈ 17:35
UT and remained quasi-static for a few minutes. This was accompanied by a
sustained increase in X-ray emission observed by RHESSI. After this ﬁrst stage,
at ≈ 17:43 UT the ﬁlament started to erupt, which led to a CME. Two hard
X-ray sources appeared at ≈ 17:45 UT within the two elongated ﬂare ribbons
seen by IRIS in 1400 ˚A. The event is front-sided from Earth’s view and back-
sided from the STEREO A and B spacecraft. EUV images show a global coronal
bright front that begins to expand around 17:45 UT. The coronal bright front,
accompanied by a coronal dimming, expanded to the north, west and east, while
Hα high-resolution images showed a Moreton wave. These wavefronts constitute
the subject matter of this article.

Our article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data used,
Section 3 presents our qualitative analysis of the wave events at diﬀerent atmo-
spheric levels (chromosphere, low corona) and of their white-light counterpart.
In Section 4 we perform a quantitative study of the shock-front properties
and propose a geometrical model to explain the observed wavefronts as the
chromospheric and EUV traces of an expanding and outward-traveling bubble
intersecting the Sun. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss our results and conclude.

2. The Data

AIA provides full-disk images of the low corona with a pixel spatial size of
0.6”and a temporal resolution of 12 sec in multiple wavelengths. This character-
izes AIA as the best instrument to date for the analysis of coronal waves in the
EUV range (see the review by Liu and Ofman, 2014).

To study the coronal bright fronts on 29 March 2014, we used the AIA
passbands centered on Fe ix (171 ˚A), Fe xii/xxiv (193 ˚A) and Fe xiv (211 ˚A),
in which plasma emission at temperatures in the range of 0.5 – 2.5 MK can be
detected. To allow for comparisons with the Moreton-wave data, we also analyzed
images captured with the ﬁlter centered on He ii (304 ˚A). The He ii passband
detects plasma in the transition region with a characteristic temperature of
≈ 5 × 104 K. AIA images between 17:35 UT and 18:15 UT were processed using
the Solar Software standard procedures and were rebinned to 20482 pixels to
decrease memory requirements and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. To avoid
variations in the background of the images, we chose to use AIA images with
exposure times longer than 0.06 s for the 171˚A, 211˚A and 304 ˚A bands and
0.6 s for the passband centered on 193 ˚A. This selection criterion results in
time diﬀerences between consecutive images of 24 s at most. The images were
derotated to a pre-event time (17:30 UT) to correct for the displacement of
coronal structures due to the diﬀerential rotation of the Sun.

To study the Moreton wave, we used high-temporal resolution Hα images
obtained with the Hα Solar Telescope for Argentina (HASTA: Bagal´a et al.,

SOLA: moreton.tex; 6 November 2018; 22:47; p. 6

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

1999; Fernandez Borda et al., 2002; Francile et al., 2008). HASTA is located at
the Estaci´on de Altura U. Cesco of the Observatorio Astron´omico F´elix Aguilar,
in El Leoncito, San Juan, Argentina. HASTA records images at the hydrogen
Hα line center (656.27 nm, 0.03 nm FWHM) and in its red and blue wings (± 0.5
nm). The instrument has two operation modes: patrol mode and ﬂare mode. In
patrol mode, the camera obtains images with a cadence of 2 min. Solar activity
is analyzed in real time; when an event with an intensity above a certain level is
detected, the camera switches to ﬂare mode. In this mode, HASTA can image the
Sun with a ﬁve-second temporal cadence in the Hα line center. The high temporal
cadence in the ﬂare mode makes HASTA a suitable instrument to study Moreton
waves; in particular, during the initial propagation phase. HASTA images have
1280 × 1024 pixels with a spatial resolution of ≈ 2”. In this article, we use
a set of Hα line-center images acquired with a 50-millisecond exposure time
between 17:41 UT and 17:53 UT, covering the whole Moreton event with a ﬁve-
second temporal cadence. The images were pre-processed following a standard
instrument procedure, scaled, and rotated to match AIA frames. To correct for
the jitter produced by the seeing, we applied a cross-correlation technique to
center AR 12017 in all images.

3. The Wave Event on 29 March 2014

In the following sections, we analyze propagating disturbances that evolve at dif-
ferent atmospheric levels using remote-sensing data recorded in several spectral
bands. To measure and compare these dissimilar data, we deﬁned two measure-
ment frameworks, a surface frame and a plane-of-sky frame. The ﬁrst is intended
to be used with chromosphere and transition region data, i.e. those registered
in the Hα and He ii bands. The related emissions take place close to the solar
surface, and in consequence should be measured over a curved surface, namely
the solar sphere. The plane-of-sky frame is useful to measure emissions at low
coronal heights, such as those in the AIA coronal EUV bands (e.g. 193 ˚A and
211 ˚A). The bulk of these emissions comes from a certain coronal height, but we
used the data to delineate features propagating at diﬀerent altitudes, like dome-
shaped shock wavefronts, whose borderline can be considered as approximately
located in the plane-of-view of the analyzed images. In consequence, we deﬁne
the plane-of-sky frame, which is ﬂat as opposed to the surface frame.

3.1. Hα and He ii Wave

The Moreton-wave event on 29 March is detectable in HASTA images applying
running-diﬀerence techniques. It appears as a diﬀuse arc-shaped front propa-
gating to the north of AR 12017 and evolving after the ﬂare impulsive phase.
Similar features can be detected in the AIA He ii (304 ˚A) band. A running-
diﬀerence full-disk image movie built from Hα data is attached to this article
(see Movie-Halpha), as well as a running-diﬀerence subﬁeld image movie in the
He ii (304 ˚A) band (see Movie-304).

blue arrows in both panels point to the propagating perturbation. (c) Great circles traced on an
image recorded at the center of the Hα line at 17:43:53 UT. (d) Similar to panel c in He ii band
at 17:38:07 UT. The circles are traced on the surface of the solar sphere, i.e. with a radius
of 1 R(cid:12), and depart from the radiant point deﬁned as the site where the ﬂare is strongest
(coordinates N10.3 W32.8). The 72 sectors separated by 5◦ each are arbitrarily numbered
in a counterclockwise order, beginning from the sector that is centered on the solar south
pole. Some of the sectors have been numbered. The tracing corresponds to an angular span of
α =100◦ from the radiant point. The ﬁeld of view in panels c and d is 2.08×2.08 R(cid:12).

We determined the kinematic characteristics of the Moreton wave using the
intensity proﬁles technique (Vrˇsnak et al., 2002). The intensity proﬁles [δ(ri, tj)]
are obtained from the running-diﬀerence image corresponding to time tj along
paths ri traced on the solar disk (surface frame). The paths ri are the plane
projection of great circles of the solar sphere passing through a radiant point
(RP, see Figure 1c and 1d). We approximated the actual origin site of the wave
event, i.e. the RP, as the centroid of the most intense ﬂare kernel in the AR
that corresponds to 514.2” in the east–west and 263.4” in the north–south

directions in the heliocentric-Cartesian coordinate system and N10.3 W32.8 in
the heliographic system.

The intensity proﬁles [δ(ri, tj)] were discretized in angular steps along the
corresponding great circle with a resolution of 0.1◦, starting from the RP. Each
discrete value is computed by averaging the intensity values laterally over an
angular sector of 5◦ centered on the RP. In this way, the solar surface distance
from the RP to a certain point P of the path ri can be computed as dc = α
1 R(cid:12), where α is the angle subtended between the two radial vectors formed by
the pairs of points (O, RP ), (O, P ) in 3D, where O is the center of the solar
sphere.

To investigate the angular dependence of the evolution of the wave event,
we applied a stack plot procedure (Liu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012). In this
way, distance-time (DT) maps werebuilt by stacking in columns the intensity
proﬁles [δ(ri, tj)] corresponding to a speciﬁc path ri over the full time-span of
the wave event. These columns were expanded for the time span in seconds
between the corresponding image of the set and the next one, therefore the DT-
maps abscissae are in seconds. The DT-map ordinates are the surface distance
[dc] measured from the RP.

We covered the 360◦ around the RP with 72 sectors of 5◦ each, thus obtaining
72 DT maps in correspondence with the 72 paths ri, numbered counterclockwise
starting from a great circle passing through the solar south pole. Figure 1 shows
the 72 sectors superimposed to Hα (panel c) and He ii (panel d) images. The
reference sector 0 starts at the great circle denoted with the thick white-line that
crosses the solar south pole.

The results of this procedure for sectors 31 to 46 can be observed in Figure 2.
The Moreton wave is visible in Hα DT-maps (Figure 2a) as an oblique bright
trace for all the displayed sectors. The slope of these traces indicates the speed of
the Moreton wave in the corresponding sector. The region where the traces are
brighter, i.e. between sectors 35 to 46, shows an initial brief lapse of deceleration
after which the speed of the Moreton wave is almost constant. Sectors 36 to 39
show regions with an apparent overlap of two traces very close in time (see
the insets in the corresponding sector panels). He ii DT-maps (Figure 2b) show
similar oblique traces. The traces are not continuous and have the appearance of
a succession of parcels with ﬂuctuating intensity. No overlap of the traces can be
discerned, in contrast to the Hα DT-maps. The vertical stripes in the background
correspond to changes in the exposure time of AIA during the recording of the
ﬂare peak-intensity.

We obtained normalized light curves of the whole ﬂaring region, shown in
Figure 3 for Hα (panel a) and He ii (panel b). To compare these curves, which
have a similar temporal evolution but a diﬀerent intensity scale, we divided
them by their maximum intensity value, i.e. we normalize them. From these
curves we derived a ﬂare onset time as the peak of the derivative of the light
curves. The derivative was computed using a standard quadratic three-point
Lagrangian interpolation. The values obtained are t = 17:45:15.82 UT for Hα
and t = 17:45:20.57 UT for He ii. We chose the value obtained from Hα as
the reference ﬂare onset time [ton = 17:45:16] because of the higher temporal
cadence of the HASTA telescope in ﬂare mode.

propagating feature, and the light blue arrows a propagating perturbation closer to the solar

Several propagating features with dissimilar characteristics are visible in AIA
images at 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 211 ˚A, some of which are displayed in panels a, b,

while the large-scale loops to the east indicate its connectivity to scattered
negative-polarities belonging to a large bipolar region. The light blue arrows
in this panel indicate a northward-propagating arc-like disturbance that we
associate with the chromospheric Moreton-wave event described in Section 3.1.
Figure 4b and 4c exhibit a tenuous circular-shaped propagating feature de-
noted by black arrows. The running-diﬀerence 193 ˚A and 211 ˚A images appear
similar, with this feature surpassing the solar disk. This structure can be associ-
ated with an MHD coronal wave- or shock-front that likewise propagates in all
directions. A second slower and circular feature indicated with green arrows in
the same panels is also noticeable. This might be a secondary shock, but it could
also be attributed to the leading edge of the expanding CME, as suggested by
Patsourakos and Vourlidas (2012). Light blue arrows in Figure 4b and 4c indicate
more irregular propagating features that show correspondence with these fronts,
also pointed out with light blue arrows, in Figure 4a. They could be ascribed to
an origin closer to the solar surface. They are probably caused by the interaction
of the shock fronts at transition region levels or by eﬀects of the lateral expansion
of the CME bubble during its ejection. The analysis of the kinematics of the
various fronts in Section 4 is helpful to validate some of these hypotheses.

To follow and characterize the visible fronts in the plane of view, we now track
the evolution of the wavefronts in the plane-of-sky frame. To accomplish this, we
built a new set of stack plots obtained from a plane-of-sky measurement scheme,
obtaining the intensity proﬁles in a similar way as described in Section 3.1,
i.e. discretizing in linear steps of ∼ 1215 km along the corresponding straight
path that bisects the sectors, starting from the RP. Each discrete value was
computed by averaging the intensity values laterally over an angular sector of 5◦
centered on the RP. To ensure that the surface and plane-of-sky frames coincide,
we traced the plane-of-sky bisector for each sector to match the solar-surface
great circle tracing at some points P distant α = 1◦ from the RP, where α is the
angle subtended between the two radial vectors formed by the pairs of points
(O, RP ) and (O, P ), as deﬁned above. The resulting sector tracing of the plane-
of-sky frame can be observed in Figure 4d.

The plane-of-sky DT-maps obtained by stacking the intensity proﬁles of the
193 ˚A band for various sectors can be observed in Figure 5. Each panel of the
mosaic is the DT map of a speciﬁc sector, but in this case the DT-map ordinates
exceed the solar limb, which is indicated by a horizontal white line in the diﬀerent
panels. Although the wave event is visible in sectors 10 to 47, we only show it
from sector 16 onward in this ﬁgure. The wave feature appears brighter from
sector 35 to 44, where it has an angular span of approximately 45◦ toward the
north. Figure 5 shows the following:

• The ﬁrst visible perturbation is a well-deﬁned bright front with an initial
rising slope nearly constant, which tends to decelerate far from the RP. The
front surpasses the limb indicating it propagates out of the Sun. This well-
deﬁned thin front can be associated to a shock that compresses the coronal
medium as it propagates producing an EUV emission enhancement. Close
to the RP it is hard to discern the front due to the ﬂare intensity eﬀects
that disturb the observation. This shock front would correspond to the
borderline of a 3D dome-shaped structure, evolving outward in the corona.

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

Figure 5. Stack plots of sectors 16 to 47 from AIA 193 ˚A in the plane-of-sky frame. The
abscissae represent time in seconds and the ordinates distance [ds] from the RP in Mm. The
dimensions of each panel are 850.3 Mm × 840 sec (t = 17:45:00 UT to t = 17:59:00 UT). The
vertical black line indicates the reference ﬂare time. The horizontal white line in each stack
plot indicates the solar-limb position. The separation between two ticks in the abscissae is 60
seconds and in the ordinates 100 Mm.

• The slopes of the ﬁrst front are similar but not equal in the diﬀerent panels,
suggesting an angular dependence of the shock-front speed. This could be
attributed to inhomogeneities of the coronal environment where the wave
propagates, but a line-of-sight projection of the 3D dome-shaped structure
or a particular behavior of the 3D piston that generates the shock wave are
also possible.

• After the shock, some bright and complex propagating structures are visible
in all of the displayed sectors. It is possible to see that these features,
initially co-spatial, detach from the shock front at a certain distance from
the RP (see panels for sectors 35 to 45). This can be attributed to near-
surface EUV waves.

• Some diﬀuse features, slower than the shock but faster than the bright
structures, surpass the solar limb in panels for sectors 30 to 32, which
may be indicative of an outward propagation. Probably, these features
correspond to some CME parts visible during its lift oﬀ, but the presence
of other true MHD waves cannot be ruled out.

3.3. White-light Counterpart

The CME associated with the low-coronal event was ﬁrst seen at 18:12 UT
with the C2 coronagraph of the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph
(LASCO: Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard SOHO. Initially, it appeared as a
bright front toward the north–west. The CME quickly evolved to become a full-
halo CME with its main bulk also to the north–west (see Figure 6a). According
to the SOHO LASCO CME Catalog (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/), the
projected speed of its fastest front at a position angle of 324◦ after a linear
ﬁt is 528 km s−1, with the most distant points showing a slightly decelerated
proﬁle. The STEREO spacecraft were located almost at the opposite side of

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

Earth, separated by almost 42◦, as shown in the cartoon in Figure 6b. From the
viewpoint of the coronagraph COR2 onboard STEREO-B, the CME appears
nearly symmetric (Figure 6c) but with its main bulk towards the north. From
the perspective of STEREO-A, the CME appears as a partial halo traveling
toward the northwest (Figure 6d). With these stereoscopic considerations, the
3D propagation direction of the CME is obtained by means of the forward model
developed by Thernisien, Vourlidas, and Howard (2009). The deduced direction
is N37 W34, suggesting a northward deﬂection of ≈ 27◦ when we consider the
source region at the RP coordinates (N10.3 W32.8).

We interpret the outermost rim of the CME as indicative of a shock wave
ahead of the CME bulk, as done by Ontiveros and Vourlidas (2009). To enhance
the shock signatures, which are fainter than the bulk of the CME, we produced
sequences of running-diﬀerence images. The CME shock can be discerned from
the much brighter CME material, not only because it is fainter, but also because
it appears as a distinct somewhat circular and continuous rim that envelops the
CME bulk, which is usually of-center because of projection eﬀects. Toward the
northwest in Figure 6a the CME leading edge meets the shock, while especially
to the east and south the only observable feature is the shock, as indicated by
the arrows. In a similar manner, in the STEREO-B COR2 image (Figure 6c)
the bulk of the CME travels toward the north, while to the west, south, and
east only the shock is evident. STEREO-A COR2 also shows the shock wave
but to the southeast, in agreement with the CME propagation direction and the
spacecraft locations. An interpretation of these images to ﬁnd correspondences
between the CME and solar features is attempted in Section 4.4.

4. The Kinematics of the Moreton and EUV Waves

To measure the locations of the wavefronts in the DT maps obtained from the
surface-frame and the plane-of-sky assumptions, we applied a visual method
to identify and select the bright traces given that the fronts exhibit a non-
homogeneous and diﬀuse pattern, especially away from the RP. This task was
performed on each DT map by manually selecting several points belonging to
the leftmost side of the bright trace outline, i.e. the features of the traveling
perturbation that appear ﬁrst in time. These points were then connected by
means of a spline to build a proﬁle that represents the temporal evolution of the
distance [dc]. To minimize errors the procedure was repeated at least ﬁve times,
obtaining an average spline for each of the sectors of interest. As an example,
Figure 7 shows the average splines obtained under the surface-frame assumption
for sector 40 for Hα (panel a) and He ii (panel b) superimposed on the DT map.
The thin yellow lines at both sides of the thick line mark the error band at ±
3σs.

of interest to the average spline obtained, as indicated above. These curves are
suitable to ﬁt smoothly kinematic trajectories with non-constant accelerations.
The power-law is given by:

d(t) = c1(t − t0)δ + c2,

(1)

where t0 is given the arbitrary value of 17:30:00 UT. To understand the kinematic
evolution, the instantaneous values of speed and acceleration are evaluated at
the ﬂare onset time ton = 17:45:16 UT and at a subsequent time t = 17:50:00
UT using the following equations:

v(t) = c1 δ (t − t0)(δ−1),

a(t) = c1 δ (δ − 1) (t − t0)(δ−2),

(2)

(3)

The instantaneous values obtained from both Hα and He ii data are listed
in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The mean values listed in the tables are
obtained averaging those sectors in which the wave is brighter, i.e. sectors 35 to
43.

In both tables the accelerations are negative with an absolute value that
decreases with time, thus indicating that the wave tends to slow down with a
non-constant deceleration. The absolute values obtained from He ii data are on
average similar to those from Hα, both in regard to acceleration and speed. The
initial speeds of the Moreton front derived from Hα at ton (Table 1) vary in the
range 650 – 900 km s−1, disregarding the discordant value of sector 33. The wave
speed decays to approximately 490 – 800 km s−1 ﬁve minutes later.

To validate these measurements, we applied the automated Coronal Pulse
Identiﬁcation and Tracking Algorithm (CorPITA: Long et al., 2014) to HASTA
Hα data. The average values are listed in the last row of Table 1; a similar value
of average initial speed but an almost double value of initial deceleration are
shown. This inconsistency could be due to the method used by the CorPITA

4.2. Plane-of-Sky Velocity

We apply the same procedure as in Section 4.1 to obtain curves representative
in the plane-of-sky
of the evolution of the shock fronts in the low corona, i.e.
frame. The DT maps from AIA 193 ˚A sectors 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, and 45 are
displayed in Figure 8 with the average splines obtained via the visual method
superimposed in white. For comparison, we also determine the splines from Hα
and AIA 304 ˚A in the plane-of-sky frame. These are represented by the yellow
and red lines respectively in the same ﬁgure.

We obtain the kinematic characteristics of the shock wavefront in each sector
for AIA 193 ˚A in the same way as in Section 4.1, i.e. by ﬁtting power-law curves
to the average splines in the full temporal range. The results are presented in
Table 3, calculating the instantaneous values of acceleration and speed for the
times ton=17:45:16 UT and t=17:50:00 UT.

from AIA 193 ˚A data. In this plot, increasing x corresponds to the east–west
direction and increasing y to the south–north direction. This graph is obtained
by plotting the ds distances every 15 s from the RP, derived from the average
splines along the corresponding trajectories previously used to deﬁne the sectors,
from ton=17:45:16 UT to t=17:55:46 UT. The resulting wavefronts can be seen
in Figure 9. Several characteristics of the shock evolution are evident:

• A fairly homogeneous circular pattern is observed between sectors 16 and
45, which would indicate the evolution of a quasi-circular coronal front in
the plane-of-sky view. This front could be interpreted as the borderline of
a quasi-spherical 3D-dome EUV wave evolving towards the observer.
• Between sectors 29 and 34, however, the wavefront exhibits a lobe, suggest-
ing that it moves faster in this region than in the remaining sectors. This
is in agreement with the initial speed values listed in Table 3.

• Southward from AR 12017 no shock wave is detected, probably because the
high Alfv´en velocity in the AR inhibits the shock formation and propagation
(Vrˇsnak and Cliver, 2008). To both sides of the AR (sectors 10 – 15 and 49 –
59) the shock exhibits an irregular pattern. This is probably the result of
a more diﬀuse and less intense shock front in these sectors, thus implying
higher measurement errors.

• The entire circular pattern appears to move northwards as indicated by the
green plus signs that denote the locations of the centers of every wavefront.
These are determined by interpolating circumferences to the wavefronts

are listed in Table 4.

The centers of the interpolated circumferences are superimposed in Figure 9
as green plus signs. They show a pronounced northward drift as time evolves,
slightly oscillating in the east–west direction.

To obtain an indication of the origin site of the wave event, we perform a
backwards extrapolation to the ﬂare reference time [ton] of the x and y values,
using the linear and quadratic ﬁts of Figure 10a and b. The results can be
observed in Figure 9, where the green and red ‘x’ signs indicate the (x, y) position
obtained from the linear and quadratic ﬁts, respectively. These two points do
not coincide with the RP, but lie in the close vicinity of the AR.

Next, we correlate the measured coronal shock with the chromospheric More-
ton traces. Several authors suggest that Moreton waves can be explained by a
3D dome-shaped coronal shock front pushing down and sweeping the chromo-
sphere (see references in Section 1). If this is the case, we should expect that
both measurements, chromospheric and coronal, coincide when intersecting the
coronal shock-front with the Sun’s surface.

Following this hypothesis the results obtained above by measuring the shock
fronts (see Figures 9 and 10) could be assumed as the borderline in the plane-
of-sky of a 3D structure, more or less regular, that propagates outward in the
corona. Furthermore, this structure probably drifts northward, according to the
temporal evolution of the (x, y) coordinates of the interpolated circumferences’
centers.

We assume a simple model for this 3D structure, namely an expanding sphere
whose center drifts with constant velocity [v = (vx, vy, vz)] and starts moving
from a point located at a certain height [h] above the RP. This model implicitly
assumes a piston driver for the wave event. This piston driver is initially located
in the vicinity of the AR and starts moving along a speciﬁc 3D path at a par-
ticular time [t0], close to the ﬂare onset time [ton], compatible with the ﬁlament
ejection and CME lift oﬀ (see e.g. Liu et al., 2015 for a detailed analysis of the
ﬁrst stages of the event and Section 1 for a summary).

A sketch of this model can be seen in Figure 11a. This panel shows a planar
cut of the solar sphere along a great circle that includes the RP. The observer’s
LOS is indicated in the ﬁgure. The observer is able to measure both the plane-of-

sky coronal distances between the shock and the RP [ds] and the chromospheric
distances traveled by the Moreton traces over the solar surface [dc].

If the Moreton trace is originated by the shock wave sweeping the chromo-
sphere, the distance dc(ti) must match the intersection of a sphere centered at
the point C(ti) = (xc(ti), yc(ti), zc(ti)) and with radius r(ti). We use ti instead
of t to make reference to the speciﬁc instants of time we use to deﬁne the average
splines in the plane-of-sky and surface frame.

Due to inhomogeneities in the shock front in the plane-of sky frame seen in
Figure 9, we use a measured sphere radius [r(cid:48)(ti)] obtained from the distances
[ds(ti)], instead of the mean radius [r(ti)] obtained from the geometrical inter-
polation of Figure 10c. Furthermore, ds(ti) corresponding to sector n in the
plane-of-sky frame, must agree with dc(ti) of sector n in the surface frame, at
the same time [ti]. Each radius [r(cid:48)] can be obtained from the corresponding
distance [ds] as it can be deduced from the scheme in Figure 11b, which exhibits
an (x, y) plane-of-sky view of the measured distance [ds] of a point P , the RP,
and the center of the expanding spheres, all considered at the same time ti. This
view would correspond to one of the images captured during the event with the
observer’s located in front of the ﬁgure. According to Figure 11b, if the origin is
set in coincidence with the RP coordinates, from the law of cosines we obtain:

r(cid:48) = (cid:112)d(cid:48)2 + d2

where γn is the angle with respect to the x axis of the analyzed sector n and

the measured shock sphere with the solar surface, we design an algorithm that
ﬁnds which of the points Pj(ti) = (xj(ti), yj(ti), zj(ti)) of the set of distances
[dc(ti)] and sector n traced over the solar sphere, i.e. in the surface frame, ﬁts
the expanding sphere of radius r(cid:48)(ti), obtained as explained above and centered
at point C(ti) = (xc(ti), yc(ti), zc(ti)). The coordinates xc(ti), yc(ti), zc(ti) of
the center point C(ti) are obtained as:

where ∆t = (ti − t0).

The algorithm ﬁnds the points Pj(ti) in sector n from the following inequation:

distance, l is the time of the measurement in seconds and m the number of points
for path n, in this case 1000.

The free parameters of the model are the values h, vx, vy, vz, and the time t0.
We estimate the velocities vx and vy from the linear ﬁt parameters listed in Ta-
ble 4. We obtain t0 as the average value of the roots of the interpolated quadratic
curves of the average splines of sectors 16 to 47 and ﬁnd that t0 = 17:44:06.75
UT.

Kleint et al. (2015) measured the velocity of the ejected ﬁlament associated
with the 29 March ﬂare. They estimated a range of projected speeds from 130
to 230 km s−1 at 17:44:37 UT and 340 to 700 km s−1 at 17:45:13 UT. The
initial ﬁlament height could not be measured by these authors due to the low
Doppler signal, implying that such a low speed is characteristic of chromosphere
and transition region heights. In consequence, we assume h = 1000 km. As
mentioned in Section 1, Liu et al. (2015) found an asymmetric ﬁlament eruption
and determined a speed of 620 km s−1 at around 17:43 UT.

For the remaining free parameter [vz] we ﬁnd an acceptable ﬁt choosing 310

km s−1 when varying vz in steps of 10 km s−1.

Finally, we ﬁnd a reasonable ﬁt of our model when the sphere’s center is mov-
ing at a constant speed with components vx = −49.23 km s−1, vy = 421.05 km
s−1, and vz = 310.0 km s−1.

In Figure 12, we take the DT maps built from AIA 193 ˚A for several sectors
in the surface frame as a basis to draw various proﬁles. We superimpose to these
DT maps the Hα and AIA 304 ˚A measured splines in yellow and red, respectively.
These roughly delineate the behavior of the brighter front that travels behind
the faint and faster shock-wave seen in the coronal lines. The results of the
model, i.e. the deduced shock-wave intersection at the solar surface, is drawn
in green. From the ﬁgure, we see a general good ﬁt between our model and
the Hα and He ii traces, which suggests that the intersection of these spheres
with the chromosphere corresponds in fact with the Moreton and He ii waves.
In the western sectors 35 and 37 and beyond ≈ 200 Mm of the RP, the model
results appear below the chromospheric traces, i.e. with slower surface speed
(see Figures12a – b), while the opposite applies for sector 43. This discrepancy
is addressed in Section 5.2.

4.4. Correspondence between EUV and White-light Features

To understand the origin of the 3D-dome EUV wave observed in the low corona in
connection with the white-light counterpart detected in coronagraphic images,
we build DT plots along three diﬀerent directions. Both the pathway of the
shock wave in the low corona and that of the CME’s shock are shown together
in Figure 13 along the central direction of sectors 29 (panel a), 40 (panel b),
and 43 (panel c). In the low corona, the shock front is tracked using the DT

maps constructed from AIA 193 ˚A and under the plane-of-sky assumption, as
explained in Section 4.2 (see also Figures 5 and 8) and considering the RP as
the origin of the wavefront. We track the shock in LASCO C2 images along the
same central directions of sectors 29, 40, and 43, which are shown as solid lines
in Figure 13d. In this panel the symbols on the lines mark the positions of the
shock fronts measured at diﬀerent times for the three sectors. The measurements
are performed under the plane-of-sky assumption as well.

equation was also applied to ﬁt the data, but the ﬁt was poor.

5. Discussion and Conclusions

We analyze the Moreton-wave event on 29 March 2014 observed in Hα by
HASTA using a 5-second temporal cadence, together with high-resolution transi-
tion region and coronal EUV observations from AIA, which enables the analysis
of wave phenomena in diﬀerent regimes of the solar atmosphere. We focus our
study on the spatial behavior of the waves, through a detailed analysis of the
angular evolution of the wavefronts, to ﬁnd correspondences between the features
observed in diﬀerent bands and atmospheric layers. In this section we address the

kinematics of the event, the correspondence found between the features detected
in the various regimes, and the origin of the shocks within the blast-wave and
piston-driven scenarios.

5.1. About the Kinematics of the Wave Event

We ﬁrstly obtain the kinematic parameters of Hα and He ii band wavefronts,
both measured on the curvature of the solar surface (Section 4.1). The parame-
ters are calculated considering an RP located at the brightest ﬂare kernel, i.e. not
using an RP derived from tracing arcs of circumferences over the chromospheric
Hα fronts as done by other authors (Warmuth et al., 2004a,b; Francile et al.,
2013). Despite the diﬀerences between the methods of measurement, we consider
that the values of the kinematic parameters (distances, speeds, and accelerations)
should be similar far from the AR.

The ﬁrst Hα traces are detected ≈ 50 Mm away from the brightest ﬂare-kernel
site. This distance to the ﬂare is shorter than the mean distance determined
by Warmuth et al. (2004b) for several Moreton events. The angular extent of
the chromospheric disturbance is ≈ 80 ◦. The Hα kinematic parameters show
the typical characteristics of Moreton chromospheric waves, with initial speeds
between 650 – 900 km s−1 decaying to 490 – 800 km s−1 ﬁve minutes later. The
instantaneous accelerations determined at the ﬂare onset time and ﬁve minutes
later listed in Table 1 yield a mean initial deceleration of ≈ 0.365 km s−2 that
decreases in absolute value with time. The analysis by sectors reveals dispersions
in the speed and acceleration values, suggesting a non-homogeneous angular
behavior of the Moreton wavefronts. A similar kinematic analysis performed on
the He ii distance-time maps shows similar values of acceleration and speed with
respect to Hα. This suggests that the upper chromosphere and the transition
region respond similarly to the increase of pressure or density produced by the
arrival of the coronal shock which leads to emission enhancements (Vrˇsnak and
Cliver, 2008; Leenaarts, Carlsson, and Rouppe van der Voort, 2012; Krause et al.,
2015).

The kinematic parameters of the shock front in the AIA 193 ˚A band are
subsequently determined for all sectors. A directional dependence of the accel-
eration and speed is evident, with the highest deceleration corresponding to
the zone covering sectors 28 – 44, i.e. the northward direction along which the
Moreton fronts are observed. The visibility range could contribute to this eﬀect
given that the wave can be tracked to much larger distances for these sectors,
thus allowing for the deceleration to become signiﬁcant in the power-law ﬁt.
The speeds calculated ≈ 5 min after the wave ignition are in general greater
than 900 km s−1 in sectors 28 – 40. Typical coronal values in quiet regions are
cs = 185 km s−1 for the sound speed, vA = 273 km s−1 for the Alfv´en speed,
and vms = 330 km s−1 for the fast magneto-acoustic speed (Warmuth, 2015),
implying for our wave a magneto-acoustic Mach number of ≈ 3, considering the
shock evolving close to the solar surface, toward the north, and far from the
AR. High mean deceleration rates correspond to high Mach-number values of
a shock wave, whereby the wave losses energy rapidly and decelerates faster.
Regardless of this fact, the speed of the wave northwards and far from the AR

SOLA: moreton.tex; 6 November 2018; 22:47; p. 28

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

is still signiﬁcant enough to ensure a high compression ratio at chromospheric
levels to generate the Moreton wave. On the other hand, a lower Mach number
is expected in the vicinity and above the AR.

The wave brightness is noticeably higher between sectors 35 – 43 in Hα and
He ii (see Figure 2). The fastest wavefront detected in the AIA 193 ˚A band
comprises sectors 28 – 40. This partial overlap suggests a relationship between
the speed of the coronal shock and the preferential propagation direction of the
Moreton wave. The higher speed of the coronal shock in this direction can be
attributed mainly to a special characteristic of the coronal medium and the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration through which the disturbance propagates, but also the
energy supplied initially by the piston driver could account for this eﬀect (Krause
et al., 2015). Figure 14 shows the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model
for Carrington rotation 2148 with the AR at central meridian passage (Fig-
ure 14a) and as viewed from Earth’s perspective on 29 March 2014 (Figure 14b).
A region of open magnetic ﬁeld lines can be seen in correspondence with sectors
35 – 43, which sets favorable conditions for the propagation of a coronal MHD
shock able to generate Moreton disturbances (Zhang et al., 2011). Furthermore,
the shock speed is fundamentally determined by the coronal magnetic ﬁeld value,
but the compression ratio decreases with increasing magnetic ﬁeld (Krause et al.,
2015). Thus, the “ﬁeld-line valley” to the north of AR 12017 having low Alfv´en
speed implies a region of high compression ratio, consequently a shock wave
traveling through it can produce a strong compression over the chromosphere
and eventually a Moreton signature. This is in agreement with the results found
by Zhang et al. (2011), who analyzed the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration present
in 13 Moreton events and concluded that the waves mostly propagate either in
regions of large-scale closed magnetic loops or along valleys delimited by two sets
of separated magnetic loops. Furthermore, given that close to the solar surface
we expect a lower fast magneto-acoustic speed, the wavefronts will tend to curve
downward, favoring compression over the chromosphere (Zhang et al., 2011). All
these facts support the hypothesis that the chromospheric Moreton fronts in our
analyzed event are produced by a coronal shock wave.

A lobe comprising sectors 29 – 34 in which the wave speeds are high is seen in
Figure 9. Following our previous discussion, these higher speed values cannot be
attributed to a fast magneto-acoustic speed in the region, since it should be low.
This speed asymmetry could also be caused by the shock refracting in the high
magnetosonic walls of the valley or by a particular behavior of a hypothetical
piston producing the wave in this area.

The non-radial propagation of the CME could be explained by the magnetic
conﬁguration to the north of AR 12017. The high magnetic pressure of the
AR would force the CME ejection toward the north, where open magnetic ﬁeld
lines and low Alfv´en speed predominate, without impeding the expansion and
propagation of the magnetic structure sustaining the CME.

5.2. About the Correspondence between the Analyzed Regimes

The stack plots built from the angular sectors for Hα and He ii (Figure 2) show
a strong correlation both in time and surface distances, suggesting that they

ﬁeld.

may respond to the same physical process. Nevertheless, the stack plots appear
diﬀerent when examined in detail, i.e. the Hα proﬁles exhibit brighter traces
and the He ii ones show a discontinuous and granular appearance. It should
be noted that, in the case of Hα, the seeing and other common ground-based
perturbations strongly aﬀect the data. In Hα, regions exhibiting double traces
are noticeable (see features indicated by light-blue arrows in sectors 36 – 39 of
Figure 2a), suggesting the presence of more than a single coronal perturbation or
a complex physical process that originates the diﬀering chromospheric emissions.
Other authors have suggested the presence of more than one Moreton-wavefront
in the vicinity of an AR (Muhr et al., 2010; Francile et al., 2013). However, in
our case the spatial separation between these two fronts is not large enough to
conclude about their presence on a ﬁrm basis. This double-trace eﬀect is not
visible in the He ii stack plots.

Figure 8 shows AIA 193 ˚A DT maps with the superimposed splines traced
from AIA 193 ˚A, Hα and He ii, all of them in the plane-of-sky frame, for six rep-
resentative sectors. The black arrows in Figure 8 denote bright coronal features
that appear to persist after the traces derived from Hα and He ii data come
to an end. These features are located at coronal heights, but probably close
to the solar surface. They could be caused by the shock front interacting with
the lower, denser layers of the corona, when the shock does not have enough
speed or intensity to perturb the chromosphere. This suggests that disturbances
like near-surface EUV waves have the same physical origin as Moreton waves,
i.e. compression in the low corona due to MHD waves or shocks. The low
occurrence of Moreton events in relation to near-surface EUV waves can be
attributed to the insuﬃcient energy of shock waves to disturb the much denser
chromosphere or to the particular characteristics of the coronal environment
where they propagate.

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

The drifting of the center of the circumferences representing the shock-wave
evolution (see Figures 9 and 10) inspires a model based on the intersection of a
hypothetical spherical shock-front with the solar surface. Dome-shaped coronal
waves with an almost circular appearance in EUV and soft X-ray observations
have been reported by several authors (e.g. Narukage et al., 2004; Veronig et al.,
2010; Kozarev et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2011; Grechnev et al., 2011a; Li et al.,
2012; Cheng et al., 2012), while numerical simulations also conﬁrm this aspect
(Warmuth, 2015, and references therein). If the model is accurate enough, the
intersection of a spherical shock-front with the solar sphere would coincide with
the measured traces in the chromospheric and transition region, sector by sector,
if a common shock wavefront is responsible for all the eﬀects. Combining the
results derived from our measurements of the coronal-wave kinematics with the
results found by other authors who analyzed the same event (see Section 4.3),
the model is able to ﬁt the coronal fronts to the chromospheric ones. The main
diﬃculties of the model arise in the north–west and north–east directions. To the
north–west of AR 12017 the model should ﬁt the evolution of shock fronts moving
away from the solar surface beyond the solar limb in the low corona, where the
fast magneto-acoustic speed of the plasma constantly increases (Mann et al.,
1999); however, as seen in Figure 12a and b the model (green line) stays below
the chromospheric Hα and He ii tracings (yellow and red lines, respectively). As
mentioned in Section 5.1, the coronal shock-fronts bend toward the solar surface
and have a dome shape (Warmuth, 2015), which implies that the measured
distances [ds] will not ﬁt the model’s spheres, and therefore the distance [ds]
to the west of the RP results in a shorter distance of intersection with the
chromosphere (see Figure 12a and b). The opposite is true to the east of the RP
(see Figure 12e and f). This eﬀect is also evident in Figure 9, where the westward
shock fronts are closer together than those eastward. Some articles report that a
lag between the coronal shock-front and the Hα chromospheric perturbation of
≈ 30 Mm is common (White, Balasubramaniam, and Cliver, 2014; Krause et al.,
2015). The misalignments in Figure 12 could be also partially attributed to this
eﬀect.

Figure 4b and c exhibit running-diﬀerence images in the AIA 193 ˚A and
211 ˚A bands, where an arc-like coronal feature denoted with green arrows can
be seen. This feature propagates behind or jointly with the ﬁrst shock front,
depending on the sector. It is not possible to determine its full appearance or
follow its propagation over a considerable period of time; however, we especulate
that it may be related to the apparent dual traces visible in sectors 36 – 39 of
the chromospheric DT-maps (Figure 2b).

In Section 4.4 we compare the slope and timings of the fastest AIA 193 ˚A wave-
front with those of the shock ahead of the associated CME propagating in the
LASCO C2 ﬁeld-of-view. The good agreement evident from Figure 13 strongly
suggests that the fastest EUV front corresponds to the white-light shock driven
by the CME. The misalignment of the two sets of measurements from sector
29 (Figure 13a) may be due to the wave propagating with a large component
away from the plane-of-view in this direction, while we are using the plane-of-
sky approximation to compare both data sets. The overall correspondence is
in agreement with the uniﬁed picture of EUV waves synthesized from a series

SOLA: moreton.tex; 6 November 2018; 22:47; p. 31

C.N. Francile et al.

of ﬁndings by Patsourakos and Vourlidas (2012), whereby the inner brighter
front is attributed to the expanding CME loops or bubble and the outer fainter
front is the fast-mode wave ahead of the CME ﬂanks and leading edge. Further
agreement is found with the ﬁndings by Kwon et al. (2013), who noted that the
wavefront in the upper (white-light) solar corona turns out to be the counterpart
of the EUV wave.

5.3. About the Origin of the Shocks

We now discuss how the results of our modeling and of the wave-event analysis
ﬁt within the blast-wave and piston-driven shock scenarios, i.e. a ﬂare-driven or
CME-driven origin. As discussed above, the directional dependence of the speed
can be explained by a spherical shock wavefront whose center moves mostly
northward and outward from a RP. This suggests a piston-driven shock likely
produced by a CME moving in the direction of the model sphere’s center, in
which the piston is directly behind the shock front and close to the upper sphere’s
border. In this case, if visible in EUV, the ﬂanks of the piston should appear in
the plane of vision as a circular-shaped feature within the ideal spherical shock.
In this scenario, the apparent larger speed lobe of sectors 29 - 34 could be an
indication of the driver, distorted from the ideal shock sphere in the direction of
its propagation.

The found directional dependence of accelerations and speeds does not comply
with the blast-wave scenario of shock generation in a fairly homogeneous coronal
medium. This suggests either that the medium is not homogeneous or that the
wave under study is not a blast-generated shock-wave. Although the region to
the north of the AR appears to be homogeneous (see Figures 4 and 14), that is
not the case in the vicinity of the AR, as is evident in Figure 9. In the case of
a piston-driven shock, the shape of the shock wave is determined by the piston
shape and the time elapsed until the piston stops acting as shock generator, as
well as by the coronal medium.

In a ﬂare-produced shock, a pressure pulse, static and close to the solar
surface, would produce a shock of the blast-wave type. The constant speed of
the sphere’s center used by our model cannot be in agreement with such a shock,
even if it is considered that the shock evolves as a freely propagating blast wave
after the piston stops acting as the wave driver.

The hypothesis of a ﬂare impulsive pressure-pulse that generates a blast wave
responsible for the Moreton event is unlikely, given that the wave perturbation
is seen to start in coincidence with the ﬂare onset time [ton] (see Figure 7). It
should be noted that the time ton is determined from the same data taken as
a basis for the DT maps. Following Vrˇsnak and Cliver (2008), such coincidence
cannot account for the necessary delay in the shock formation after the onset
of the ﬂare pressure pulse, given reasonable values of ambient Alfv´en speed and
piston expansion speed. Some authors have suggested that the launch of Moreton
events precedes the ﬂare impulsive phase (Veronig, Temmer, and Vrˇsnak, 2008;
Muhr et al., 2010), while others ﬁnd a close temporal coincidence (Warmuth
et al., 2004b; Temmer et al., 2009; Francile et al., 2013), thus indicating that
probably not all Moreton events are similar in this sense.

SOLA: moreton.tex; 6 November 2018; 22:47; p. 32

Comparative Analysis of a Moreton and EUV Wave

To consider the hypothesis of piston-driven shock-wave generation, it is fun-
damental to understand the characteristics of the potentially associated piston.
Kleint et al. (2015) measured the acceleration of the ﬁlament corresponding
to this event, obtaining 3 – 5 km s−2 between t = 17:44:30 UT and t = 17:45:00
UT, with the peak upﬂow velocity at t = 17:45:40 UT. In relation with other
event, Temmer et al. (2009) found that a synthetic 3D piston of size ≈ 110 Mm
accelerated to ≈ 4.8 km s−2 during ≈ 160 s, was able to generate a shock wave
in correspondence with the Moreton-wave kinematics. Therefore, the fast ejec-
tion of the ﬁlament/CME ensemble can be regarded as the piston and thus as
responsible for the shock wave generation. It is possible that after the ﬂare’s
impulsive phase the ﬁlament/CME is not impulsively accelerated anymore, and
therefore it continues evolving with a nearly constant speed or decelerating, with
the shock-wavefront persisting ahead of it. Otherwise, the ﬁlament/CME would
not be able to generate a shock wave inside the AR, given the high Alfv´en speed
of the region. Only when it reaches regions with low Alfv´en speed outside the AR,
i.e. northwards, it is able to generate a shock wave that steepens and produces
the chromospheric and coronal observable signatures (Vrˇsnak and Cliver, 2008).
Although the model is not accurate enough to draw conclusive results, it
yields a good approximation to the scenario of coronal wave generation. If the
case of a shock generated by a temporary piston is true, the 3D piston follows
an approximate path given by v=(vx, vy, vz), at least during the investigated
time interval. The results of our model have a good match with a sphere that
expands at the speed of the fast rising ﬁlament measured by Kleint et al. (2015)
and Liu et al. (2015), suggesting an association between the ﬁlament eruption
and the wave event. The piston could thus be attributed to the front of the CME
itself, or the full CME bubble or loops, as has been reported by several obser-
vational studies (Patsourakos and Vourlidas, 2012). Some observational reports
reinforce this picture (Kienreich, Temmer, and Veronig, 2009; Patsourakos and
Vourlidas, 2009; Veronig et al., 2010; Grechnev et al., 2011b). If this is the case,
the faster lobe of sectors 29 – 34 could be related with a piston provided by a
CME structure, probably stretched, non-radially rising, i.e. with a northward
inclination.

A CME evolving faster than the shock is not a coherent picture, given that
the piston should generate and drive the shock. The circular feature indicated
by green arrows in Figure 4 could thus be attributed to a 3D rising structure
bent to the north, e.g. an erupting CME bubble driving the shock ahead of
it, whereas the observed outermost projected lateral extent of the shock (black
arrows) maintains a circular shape.

By assuming that the piston decelerates and stops driving the shock wave at
a certain point, as done by several authors (Patsourakos and Vourlidas, 2012,
and references therein), the shock will become a freely propagating shock wave
similar to a blast wave (Warmuth, 2015), but should prevail with the speed
and shape imprinted by the driver at the initial stages. After some time, the
shock front would tend to become more homogeneous and would depend on
the particular conditions of the ambient corona and interplanetary space. The
white-light observations give account of a CME and shock evolution following
characteristics similar to those close to the origin.

5.4. Summary

We can summarize our main ﬁndings for the 29 March 2014 wave-event as
follows:

• The Moreton event exhibits the typical characteristics as regards speed,
deceleration and angular span; nevertheless the ﬁrst Hα traces detected
are at a relatively short distance from the brightest ﬂare-kernel site, when
compared with previous statistical results.

• The wave perturbation is seen to appear in coincidence with the estimated

ﬂare onset time.

• The analysis by sectors indicates a non-homogeneous angular behavior of

the wavefronts in all analyzed wavelengths.

• Observations in He ii 304 ˚A could be used as tracers and indicators of the
existence of Hα Moreton-waves even if the latter are not observed because
of either unfavourable seeing conditions or a lack of ground-based data.
• The wave speed is higher in the northward direction, which cannot be
attributed to the open magnetic ﬁeld lines and lower Alfv´en speed in that
region. This higher speed could be related to the characteristics of the
driver and region where the wave was ignited. However, the ﬁrst mentioned
conditions favor compression over the chromosphere.

• Despite its simplicity, the proposed geometrical model is able to explain the
measured chromospheric traces and the near-surface EUV wave signatures
as the intersection of a spherically expanding shock-front with the chromo-
sphere. This spherical shock can be explained as driven by a 3D piston that
follows a northward and upward path. The shock trajectory and expansion
speed are similar to those of the driver at its initial stages.

• The 3D piston can be attributed to the front of the CME or the full CME

bubble, expanding at the speed of the associated rising ﬁlament.

We plan to apply our simple model to other Moreton events to test the
generality of our results. If the model turns out to be feasible, it could be applied
to estimate the initial speeds and trajectories of ejected ﬁlaments or ﬂux ropes
during CME events.
