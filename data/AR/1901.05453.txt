A Study of Charge Radii and Neutron Skin Thickness near
Nuclear Drip Lines

Department of Physics, Himachal Pradesh University, Summer-Hill,
Shimla-171005, INDIA

We studied the charge radius, rms radius and neutron skin thickness
∆rnp in even-even isotopes of Si, S, Ar and Ca and isotones of N =20,
28, 50 and 82. The ∆rnp in doubly-magic 48Ca, 68Ni, 120,132Sn and 208Pb
nuclei has also been calculated. Theoretical calculations are done with
the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the eﬀective Skyrme interactions.
Calculated theoretical estimates are in good agreement with the recently
available experimental data. The charge radii for Si, S, Ar and Ca isotopes
is observed to be minimum at neutron number N =14. The theoretically
computed results with UNEDF0 model parameterization of functional are
reasonably reproducing the experimental data for ∆rnp in 48Ca, 68Ni and
120,132Sn. The energy density functional of UNEDF1 model provides much
improved result of ∆rnp for 208Pb.

1. Introduction

Appreciable experimental progress in producing and analyzing exotic
nuclei [1, 2] has brought renaissance of nuclear structure models. In recent
years [3, 4, 5, 6], The production of more and more new isotopes has revived
the interest in nuclear structure models. In nuclear physics, understanding
the structure of the atomic nucleus is one of the key challenges. The study
of those nuclei which are lying far from the line of β-stability play a crucial
role in the understanding of nuclear physics. The limit of nuclear existence
is reached while going far away from stability line. An unbound nuclear
system disintegrates quasi- instantaneously (in a time interval of the order

of 10−21s. Points on the nuclear chart which corresponds to nuclei that are
unbound to proton or neutron emissions in the ground state is called the
proton or neutron drip line. These drip lines form the edges of the nuclear
chart. About 280 stable nuclear species are found on Earth but, accord-
ing to latest estimates, from 5000 to 7000 bound nuclei should exist in the
Universe. Till today, about 2000 in numbers have been synthesized and
observed. Very little information is available about these unstable nuclei.
Even though the number of undiscovered bound nuclei is very large but
we are able to make single big steps by studying a few of speciﬁc nuclei.
These nuclei act as milestones in setting new eﬀects that arise in extreme
conditions of isospin asymmetry. We have chosen Si, S, Ca and Ar nuclei
for our interest as lot of research has been done on these nuclei recently
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The microscopic structure of these nuclei is of particu-
lar interest for the ﬁeld of astrophysics: the neutron-rich N≃28 nuclei play
an important role in the nucleosynthesis of the heavy Ca-Ti-Cr isotopes [13].
As these nuclides also become experimentally accessible [13, 14], they can
provide a testing ground for studying exotic nuclei.
Exotic nuclei, particularly those near the drip lines, are at the core of one of
the fundamental questions driving nuclear structure and astrophysics today:
What are the limits of nuclear binding? These Exotic nuclei play a critical
role in both informing theoretical models as well as in our understanding of
the origin of the heavy elements. Of the nuclei considered here, those with
N = Z (28Si, 32S, 36Ar and 40Ca) have been studied extensively both theo-
retically and experimentally. Among diﬀerent theoretical approaches used
are the shell-correction approach [15], Hartree-Fock [16, 17] and Hartree-
Fock-Bogolyubov methods [18], relativistic mean ﬁeld [19, 20, 21, 22], shell
model [23, 24], α-cluster model [24] and others.
To throw some light on the physics of exotic neutron-rich and magic-nuclei
near drip lines, we performed calculations based on the self-consistent mean-
ﬁeld theories: Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) with the Skyrme eﬀective
interactions approach. The physical observables of interest are nuclear root
mean square radius (Rrms), nuclear charge radius (Rc) and neutron skin
thickness (∆rnp). The nuclear charge radius is one of the most fundamen-
tal nuclear properties that describes the eﬀect of eﬀective interactions on
nuclear structure [43, 25]. It can be measured experimentally by methods
based on the electromagnetic interaction between the nucleus and electrons
or muons. One of the parameter that can be expressed through the nu-
cleon density distribution is neutron skin thickness which depends on the
properties of the nuclear surface. For large neutron excess, the bulk of
neutron density is believed to extend beyond the proton density creating a
sort of ”neutron skin”. To determine the nature of the neutron distribution
accurately in a nuclei has received considerable attention in recent years

[28, 26, 27]. As neutron number increases, the radius of the neutron density
distribution becomes larger than that of the protons, reﬂecting the pressure
of the symmetry energy.

2. Theoretical Framework

The present study has been done by using the model based on Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov Theory [32, 33]. A brief discussion of the theory is given
below.
In this theory, the pairing ﬁeld and the mean ﬁeld are given equal footings.
Zero range Skyrme interactions are used in the self consistent mean ﬁeld
part [34]. For the Skyrme forces, The HFB Energy has the form of local
energy density functional [30, 37]:

E[ρ, ˜ρ] =

Z

d3rH(r)

(1)

where

H(r) = H(r) + ˜H(r)
is the sum of the mean-ﬁeld and paring energy densities. The wave function
Φ depends upon the density matrix ρ and the pairing tensor κ and in terms
of these two parameters, the HFB energy takes the form [30]:

E[ρ, κ] =

where Γ is Hartree-Fock potential and ∆ stands for the pairing potential.
They are deﬁned in their explicit form as

This leads to the HFB Hamiltonian matrix [30]:

3. Results And Discussions

We present our results for root mean square radii and charge radii re-
ﬂecting size of the nucleus. Neutron skin thickness for isotopes of Si, S, Ar
and Ca with particular reference to the disappearance of magic number N
= 28 with Z = 14 in 42Si [39] nuclei has also been analysed. Beside this,
the shell structure evolution, nuclear radii and neutron skin thickness in the
isotones at N = 20, 28, 50 and 82 and doubly magic nuclei in 48Ca, 68,78Ni,
120,132Sn and 208Pb have also been investigated. The theoretical results
are computed from Axially deformed solution of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-
Bogoliubov equations using the harmonic oscillator basis [30, 37], where the
mean ﬁeld potentials are constructed with UNEDF0 and UNEDF1 param-
eterizations [31, 29].

3.1. Size of the Nucleus

Nuclear radii of proton and neutron distributions are the key observables
to determine the size of the nuclear system. Even, these observables can
be directly related to fundamental bulk properties of nuclear matter and
also to the nature of nuclear interactions [41, 42].
In exotic neutron-rich
and heavy nuclei the excess of neutrons give rise to a neutron skin t the
size of a nuclear system such as; nuclear charge radii, neutron distributions
and neutron skin thickness have been found to correlate empirically with a
number of observables in ﬁnite nuclei [43] to neutron matter [41, 42, 44].
Hence, it further beautifully links with a plausible constraints found to
impose on the equations of state high density matter in neutron stars [45].
The goal of this section is to understand the relations between nuclear
charge and neutron radii, and compare our theoretical results with available
experimental data.

Here in Fig. (1), results for the root mean square radius Rrms in fm
plotted as a function of nuclear neutron number N, for the even-even exotic
to stable nuclides of Si (green4 left triangles), Sulphur (blue right triangles)
Ar (maroon circles) and Ca (red squares). It can be seen from Fig. (1) that
the RMS radii of the proton-rich or neutron-rich lie away from the solid
line of radii of stable nuclear systems.
In case of proton rich nuclei, the
values of RMS radii are smaller due to the smaller neutron distributions as
compared to neutron rich nuclei. That is why, the theoretically calculated
points showing RMS radius for exotic even-even nuclei of Si, S, Ar and Ca
for proton rich nuclei as shown in Fig. (1) lies little above from the stability
curve. But, for the neutron rich nuclei the theoretically calculated points
for the RMS radius of all the four nuclei (Si, S, Ar and Ca) lies little lower
than the stability curve. The solid line here represents the stability curve

for the given mass region of nuclides which is computed by using formula
R = R0N 1/3.
The results for the charge radii Rch in fermi meter as a function of nuclear
mass number A for the nuclides of Argon, Calcium, Silicon and Sulphur are
shown in Figs. (2 and 3). The theoretical charge radius is calculated using
the formulae [46] :

Rch =

q

r2
p + 0.64 f m

(7)

where, rp denotes the rms radius of the proton density distribution and
term 0.64 f m2 accounts for the ﬁnite size of proton. The experimental
measurements of Rch are also shown for comparison and represented by
symbol diamond with error bars [43].

It is clear from Figures that, those nuclei which lie in the proton drip
line and the neutron drip line have larger charge radius in comparison to the
other stable nuclei. The value of the charge radius is found to be minimum
for 28Si nucleus with N = Z = 14 as shown in upper panel of Fig. (2), 30S
nucleus with N = 14 and Z = 16 in lower panel of Fig. (2), 32Ar with N
= 14 and Z = 18 in upper panel of Fig., indicating sub-shell closure with
d5/2 occupying neutron N or proton Z = 14, as recently investigated Z = 14
sub-shell closure in 42Si nucleus [52]. The theoretical results are producing
the experimental data of charge radii Rch in isotopes in Si, S, Ar and Ca
with the UNEDF0 parameterizations [31]. Similarly, the variation of charge
radii Rch in fm as a function of nuclear mass number for various isotones of
N = 20, 28, 50 and 82 against Atomic Number (Z) are displayed in Figs. (4
and 5). The experimental results are also shown in Figures for comparison
with theoretical values.
It can be observed from the Figures that EDF
parameterizations (UNEDF0) are reproducing experimental data of charge
In case of N = 20 isotones, the experimental data is available for
radii.

3.2. Neutron Skin Thickness

The neutron skin thickness ∆rnp is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the
nuclear rms radii obtained using the density distributions for point neutrons
and point protons, i. e.,

∆rnp =

r2
n −

r2
p,

q

p

(8)

where rn refer to the neutron rms radius and rp destine the proton rms ra-
dius. It is well understood from the ref. [44] that the accurate measurement
of the neutron skin thickness would place rigid constraints on the density
dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy denoted as S(ρ). The density
dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy have direct consequences in ﬁ-
nite nuclear matter and nuclear dense matter of astrophysical interest. This
is why, it is investigated extensively from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives. Within available experimental technology in nuclear physics,
the nuclear symmetry energy can not be measured directly but the infor-
mation of this fundamental quantity can be extracted from the neutron
skin thickness and electric dipole polarizability [40]. Whereas, the direct
measurement of neutron distribution is also extremely diﬃcult, therefore,
the recent experimental probes have focused on the accurate measurements
of electric dipole polarizability αD in 208P b [47], 120Sn [48] and 68N i [49],
while for the extraction of αD in 48Ca by the Darmstadt-Osaka collabo-
ration is working on at Jeﬀerson Laboratory [50]. These nuclei are very
interesting from point of view of nuclear structure physics, because they are
neutron-rich and doubly magic nuclear systems, can be understood with
recently developed ab-initio nuclear density functionals theory. The studies
of these nuclear structure observable can provide a constraint for the size of
neutrons star [42].
In the Fig.
(6), we present the neutron skin thickness ∆rnp = rn − rp
in fm, plotted as a function of nuclear mass number A, for the chain of
even-even exotic isotopes of Silicon (green4 left triangles), Sulphur (blue
right triangles), Argon (maroon circles) and Calcium (red squares). The
theoretical estimates are computed from Axially deformed solution of the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations using the harmonic oscillator
basis model (HFB+HO), based on EDF parameterization UNEDF0. The
magnitudes of skin thickness is increasing systematically with increase in
the neutron number in the isotopes in all the elements.
In case of isotones, whose results are shown in Figs. (7 and 8), we ﬁnd that
there is decrease in the neutron skin depth with increase in atomic number
(Z) which signiﬁes that with increase in proton number, there is decline
in neutron density. This is because of the fact that as the proton number

template

raises, the rp value also increases while the neutron density is unaﬀected.
We have taken in account the isotonic chains of N = 20, N = 28.

Fig. (7) presents the neutron skin thickness in isotones corresponding
to neutron shell closures at magic N = 20 (upper panel) and N = 28 (lower
panel). In upper panel of Fig. (7), we present the neutron skin thickness
∆rnp = rn − rp in fm, plotted as a function of atomic number Z, for the
even-even isotonic chain of N = 20, for 28O, 30Ne, 32Mg, 34Si, 36S, and 38Ar
nuclei. It can be seen that the magnitude of the skin thickness is decreasing
as on increasesing the proton numbers except for 34Si with Z = 14, where it
rise a little bit from the previous nuclei (32Mg) as calculated from HFB+HO
model with Parameterization UNEDF0. Neutron skin thickness varies from
0.10 − 0.7 fm in magnitude. The 28O nucleus has large ∆rnp magnitudes of
about 0.7 fm computed with HFB+HO model due to the larger expected
neutron distributions than proton numbers. Whereas, in case of 42Ti nucleus
where Z = 22 and N = 20, the magnitude of the ∆rnp = 0.10 fm, is very
small.

In lower panel of Fig. (7), we present the neutron skin thickness ∆rnp = rn − rp

in fm, plotted as a function of atomic number Z, for even-even isotones of
neutron shell closure at N = 28 for 40Mg, 42Si, 44S, 46Ar, 48Ca, 50Ti and
52Cr. The recent observation of 40Mg [51] provides a signiﬁcant advance-
ment in our understanding of where the neutron drip line is likely to go for
nuclei with atomic number 12. In this isotopic chain we get maximum value
of ∆rnp ranging as 0.65-0.76 fm for 40Mg and 42Si. The discovery of 42Si
[52] indicates the strong evidence for a well-developed proton sub-shell clo-
sure at Z = 14 (14 protons), the near degeneracy of two diﬀerent (s1/2 and
d3/2) proton orbits in the vicinity of 42Si nucleus. Therefore 42Si nucleus
has become the focus of particular interest in discussions of nuclear shell
structure at the neutron drip line.
In Fig. (8), we present the theoretically computed results of neutron skin
thickness ∆rnp for the chain of isotones for neutron numbers at magic num-
ber 50 (upper panel) and 82 (lower panel). The magnitude of ∆rnp is being
obtained as 0.021 fm in 94Ru and 0.36 fm in 78Ni from HFB+HO model. The
theoretical value of ∆rnp in doubly magic 132Sn nucleus is 0.26 fm, which
is comparable with recent experimental extractions of ∆rnp 0.23 ± 0.02 fm
[53] and 0.29 ± 0.04 fm [54]. Lower panel of Fig. (8) presents the varia-
tion in ∆rnp for isotones from atomic number 46 (128Pd) to 68 (150Er) and,
the magnitude of skin thickness varies as 0.005 fm in 150Er - 0.32 fm in
128Er and 0.01 fm in 150Er - 0.33 fm in 128Pd, corresponding to HFB+HO
parameterization (UNEDF0). The values of ∆rnp decreases as the atomic
number Z is increasing in the chain of isotones shown in Fig. (8) At last,
in Fig. (9), we present our theoretical results of neutron skin thickness for
neutron-rich doubly-magic nuclei 48Ca, 132Sn, 208Pb and 68Ni, 120Sn the

8

computed results are compared to the recently available experimental data
[48, 47, 49, 55, 56, 57, 58, 62]

extractions [53, 54, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65]. There are many theoretical and
experimental investigations focused on 208P b, 132Sn, 120Sn, 68N i and 48Ca
nuclei, which have well understood nuclear structure due to their closed
protons and neutrons shells at the magic numbers. A recent reviews on
experimental measurements of ∆rnp in 208P b [57], suggest that its values
ranges from 0.15±0.03 fm to 0.22±0.04 fm [57], with the analysis of coher-
ent pion photo-production and pion scattering, respectively. Whereas our
theoretical results for ∆rnp = 0.17 fm in 208P b are reasonable well within
the experimental measurements.

In Fig. (9) , we have also presented and compared our results of ∆rnp for
132Sn, 120Sn, 68N i and 48Ca nuclei. It can be seen clearly that the theoret-
ically estimates from HFB+HO model (with both UNEDF0 and UNEDF1
parameterizations) are nicely matching with the recently available exper-
imental data. UNEDF0 parameterization are giving very good results of
neutron skin thickness while UNEDF0 parameterization are producing even
better results of skin thickness for the doubly magic nuclei with higher mass
number as we can see in the Fig. For lower mass number range , the result
of UNEDF0 parameterization is overestimated by approximately 0.03 fm
(when compared with experimental data) and almost matching (when com-
pared with experimental data) for 48Ca. Also for 68Ni, our result calculated
with UNEDF0 parameterization is overestimated by approximately 0.09 fm
and 0.1 fm (when both result are compared with the experimental data
taken from. The results that we have computed here are taken from Ax-
ially deformed solution of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations
using the harmonic oscillator model (HFB+HO) based on Energy Density
Functional (EDF) parameterizations UNEDF0 and UNEDF1.

4. Conclusions

By employing Nuclear Density Functionals based on HFB+HO model
parameterizations (UNEDF0 and UNEDF1) on various nuclei, we have
reached to some striking conclusions, which are discussed in this section.

The theoretically computed results with NDF parameterizations (UN-
EDF0 and UNEDF1) for nuclear root-mean-square radii Rrms, charge radii
Rch and neutron skin thickness ∆rnp deﬁned in Eq. (8) are presented and
compared with recent available experimental data. It can be extracted from
Fig. (9) that the ratio Z/N ≈ 0.7 in doubly magic nuclei 48Ca, 120Sn and
208Pb and the value of ∆rnp lies in close order of 0.16-0.19 fm, whereas for
the ratio Z/N ≈ 0.5-0.6 in 42Si, 44S and 132Sn, the value of ∆rnp is more
than 0.25 fm. This observation establishes the relationship of ratio Z/N with

∆rnp in the doubly magic and neutron rich nuclei indicating shell closures in
the recent investigations [52] in 42Si nucleus. The charge radii for Si, S, Ar
and Ca isotopes is observed to be minimum at neutron number N =14. The
small magnitudes of Rc in 28Si, 30S, 32Ar and 34Ca nuclei suggests N = 14
as a new magic number. The theoretically computed results are reasonably
reproducing the values for ∆rnp in 208P b, 120,132Sn, and 68N i nuclei are in
the ranges 0.13 - 0.19 fm, 0.12 - 0.16 fm, and 0.15 - 0.19 fm, respectively
[59], whereas the in case of 48Ca, our results overestimated by
from ref.
very small value of approximately 0.01 fm only. These results conﬁrms the
validity of skyrme-interactions with zero range pairing spin interactions for
the exotic nuclei.
