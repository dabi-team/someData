Abstract

We obtain a new quantitative deformation lemma, and then gain a new mountain pass theorem.
More precisely, the new mountain pass theorem is independent of the functional value on the
boundary of the mountain, which improves the well known results ([1, 14, 15, 17, 21]). Moreover,
by our new mountain pass theorem, new existence of nontrivial periodic solutions for some nonlinear
second-order discrete systems is obtained, which greatly improves the result in [25].

1 Introduction and main results

It is well known that the classical mountain pass theorem of Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz [1] has been
proved to be a powerful tool in applications to many areas of analysis, and quantitative deformation
lemma is used to be a very excellent method to derive diﬀerent kinds of minimax theorems including
the mountain pass theorem, we refer the authors to see [3, 7, 19, 21]. Firstly, we recall the famous
mountain pass theorem given by Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz [1]:

{
variant generalizations on this case for mountain pass theorem [1, 2, 3, 21]. One of the elegant
works is founded by Willem [21]. To be make the result more clear, we outline the quantitative
deformation lemma ﬁrst

If one lets c0 be stated in Theorem 1.1, then Willem’s result can be described as the following:

Theorem 1.2 ([21]) (Mountain pass type theorem) Let X be a Hilbert space, ϕ

Then, c is a critical value of ϕ.

For the case of c0 > c1 in mountain pass type theorems, we refer the authors to see [14, 15, 17].
Specially, we introduce a mountain pass type theorem in [15] and the extension mountain pass type
theorem in [17] as follows:

Theorem 1.3 ([15]) (Mountain pass type theorem) Let X be a Banach space and X has ﬁnite
dimension, ϕ
X and two real numbers a and r > 0 such that

(iii) any sequence (un) in X such that ϕ(un)

subsequence.

limit > a, and ϕ′(un)

→

→

0 possesses a convergent

Then, c is a critical value of ϕ.

Remark 1.1 For inﬁnite-dimensional case, Pucci and Serrin in [15] gained that c is a critical
value of ϕ when the assumption (i) in Theorem 1.3 was suitably strengthened, more precisely, their
conditions depending on c0 and the neighbor of

= r

ϕ(u),
{

u
k
k

.
}

Theorem 1.4 ([17]) (Extension mountain pass theorem) Let X be a real Hilbert space, ϕ
C 1(X, R) satisfying the (P. S.) condition, e
is a critical value of ϕ.

X and r > 0 be such that

∈
> r. If c0 > c1, c

e

Evidently, all above Theorems are based upon c0. Then, an interesting question is raised: can
we obtain a new mountain pass theorem which is independent of c0 ? In this paper, we give a
positive answer and the new mountain pass theorem is given by:

Theorem 1.5 (New mountain pass theorem) Let X be a Hilbert space, ϕ
r > 0 be such that 0 <
e
k
k
X such that
exists ˆu

where ˆc := inf γ∈ˆΓ maxt∈[0,1] ϕ(γ(t)) and

ˆΓ :=

{

C([0, 1], X) : γ(0) = 0, γ(

) = e1, γ(1) = e
}

Remark 1.2 The new mountain pass theorem is independent of c0, and if ϕ satisﬁes the (P.S.)
condition, there exists ˆu

X such that ϕ(ˆu) = ˆc .

Now, we turn to an application of our new mountain pass theorem to the existence of peri-
odic solutions of discrete systems, which has been appeared in computer science, economic, neural
networks, ecology, cybernetics, etc and extensively investigated in [4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25].
Let Z, N, R be the set of all integers, natural numbers and real numbers, respectively. In [8],
by critical point theory, Guo and Yu established the existence of periodic solutions to the below
discrete diﬀerence equations

the existence of periodic solutions of system (1.1) for superlinear f (n, un). For more results when
f (n, un) is superlinear in the second variable un, one consults to [6, 23]. When f (n, un) is sublinear
in the second variable un, we refer the authors to see [9] and [22] and for the case of f (n, un) is
neither suplinear nor sublinear, we refer to see [25]. For more details in this direction, one consults
to [4, 5, 18, 24]. It is remarked that, in [25], under the assumptions described below:

by using linking theorem [18], Zhou, Yu and Guo derived the existence of nontrivial M -periodic
solutions for system (1.1), and they give an example:

constant a and positive integer M > 3 satisfy

(cid:26)

C 2(R, R), and φ(t) is a M -periodic function satisfying

So, the second interesting question is raised: for f (n, un) is neither superlinear nor sublinear,
Z, can we still obtain the existence of

n

when condition (A2) is replaced by F (n, 0) = 0,
nontrivial periodic solutions ?

∀

< K.

In this paper, employing our new mountain pass theorem, we obtain new existence of nontrivial

periodic solutions for discrete second-order discrete system (1.1), and our result is that:

Theorem 1.6 Assume that F

∈

R, F (n + M, x) = F (n, x);

(W2) F (n, 0) = 0,

Z.

∈

∀

Then, system (1.1) has at least one nontrivial M -periodic solutions.

Remark 1.3 Obviously, condition (W2) is weaker than condition (A2), and it is easy to verify that
F (t, x) in Example 1.2 satisﬁes all the conditions of Theorem 1.6, but does not satisfy condition
(A2). So, by a diﬀerent method, i.e., Theorem 1.5, we greatly improve the result in [25].

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is devoted to establish a new quantitative defor-
mation lemma. In Section 3, by using the new quantitative deformation lemma, we derive our new
mountain pass theorem (Theorem 1.5). In Section 4, as an application of our new mountain pass
theorem, we prove Theorem 1.6.

Finally, similar to the proof for (ii), we can prove (iii). (cid:3)

Remark 2.1 By using a special domain D, a new locally Lipschitz function ψ and some skills, we
obtain Lemma 2.1, and in Lemma 2.1, more ﬁxed points, especially for u = ϕ−1(c), are obtained.

Remark 2.2 The deformations in Lemma 2.1 (i.e. conclusion (ii) and (iii)) are diﬀerent from
those in Lemma 1.1.

Now, by Lemma 2.1, we can prove our new mountain pass theorem which is independent of c0.

3 Proof of Theorem 1.5

Proof. Conclusion (i) is obvious. Suppose that conclusion (ii) does not hold. Consider β = η
where η is given by Lemma 2.1, and then we need to check two cases.

γ,

◦

Case 1. ϕ(0) < ϕ(e) = ϕ(e1) < ˆc.
By an analogue argument of conclusion (i) of Lemma 1.1, we have

β(0) = η(γ(0)) = η(0) = 0,
1
2
β(e1) = η(γ(1)) = η(e1) = e1,

β(e) = η(γ(

So, β

It follows from conclusion (ii) of Lemma 1.1 and (3.1) that ˆc 6 maxt∈[0,1] ϕ(β(t))) 6 ˆc

Combining Case 1 and Case 2, the proof for our new mountain pass theorem is complete. (cid:3)

So, ϕ(e) = ϕ(e1) = w3w2
4 > 0 = ϕ(0). Moreover, all the conditions of our new mountain pass
theorem are satisﬁed. Noticing that ϕ(u) satisﬁes the (P.S.) condition, there exists a critical point
ˆu such that ϕ(ˆu) = ˆc (ˆc is given in Theorem 1.5).

Step 5: We say the system (1.1) has at least one nontrivial M -periodic solutions.

Therefore, the existence of critical points of ϕ on EM implies the existence of periodic solutions of
system (1.1).

Note that when u1 = . . . = uM , then ∆u1 = . . . = ∆uM = 0. Combining (4.1) and F > 0
in condition (W1), then ϕ(u) 6 0. But ˆc > ϕ(e) > ϕ(0) = 0, so the above periodic solution ˆu is
nontrivial. From this Theorem 1.6 is proved. (cid:3)

independent of infkuk=r ϕ(u), we need not compute it.
