ABSTRACT

Violent solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are magnetic phenomena. However, how magnetic
ﬁelds reconnecting in the ﬂare differ from non-ﬂaring magnetic ﬁelds remains unclear owing to the lack of
studies of the ﬂare magnetic properties. Here we present a ﬁrst statistical study of ﬂaring (highlighted by ﬂare-
ribbons) vector magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere. Our systematic approach allows us to describe key physical
properties of solar ﬂare magnetism, including distributions of magnetic ﬂux, magnetic shear, vertical current
and net current over ﬂaring versus non-ﬂaring parts of the active region, and compare these with ﬂare/CME
properties. Our analysis suggests that while ﬂares are guided by the physical properties that scale with AR
size, like the total amount of magnetic ﬂux that participates in the reconnection process and the total current
(extensive properties), CMEs are guided by mean properties, like the fraction of the AR magnetic ﬂux that
participates (intensive property), with little dependence on the amount of shear at polarity inversion line (PIL)
or the net current. We ﬁnd that the non-neutralized current is proportional to the amount of shear at PIL,
providing direct evidence that net vertical currents are formed as a result of any mechanism that could generate
magnetic shear along PIL. We also ﬁnd that eruptive events tend to have smaller PIL ﬂuxes and larger magnetic
shears than conﬁned events. Our analysis provides a reference for more realistic solar and stellar ﬂare models.
The database is available online and can be used for future quantitative studies of ﬂare magnetism.

Keywords: Sun: ﬂares – Sun: magnetic ﬁelds – Sun: active regions

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that produce the most severe space weather disturbances arise from signiﬁcant
reconﬁguration of magnetic ﬁelds in the solar corona. Because these coronal ﬁelds are rooted in the underlying, much-denser
solar photosphere, understanding how ﬂares and CMEs work requires understanding the structure and evolution of magnetic
ﬁelds from the photosphere to the corona. Historically, most of the analyses of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds before and during
the ﬂares focused on the active region (AR) as a whole (e.g. Toriumi & Wang 2019). However, ﬂare observations have shown
that only a fraction of the AR magnetic ﬁeld participates in the ﬂare – from the analysis of 3000 solar ﬂares we found that the

fraction of active-region magnetic ﬂux that undergoes reconnection ranges from (3 ± 2)% to (21 ± 10)% for C1 to X-class ﬂares,
respectively (see Fig. 11 in Kazachenko et al. 2017). Moreover, subsequent ﬂares can occur in very different areas of the same
AR – a well-known example is the two extreme events on 2003 October 28 and 29 that occurred in different locations in AR
10486 (Kazachenko et al. 2010). This implies that to understand why and how ﬂares occur, we need to understand the properties
of the magnetic ﬁelds that participate in the ﬂare and also how they differ from the AR as a whole.

According to the canonical, two-dimensional (2D) ﬂare model called the CSHKP model (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1968;
Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976) and its extension to 3D (Longcope et al. 2007; Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier et al. 2014;
Savcheva et al. 2015, 2016), maps of ﬂare ribbons identify footpoints of newly-reconnected magnetic ﬁelds (see Figure 1). In
relation to magnetic topology, ribbons correspond to locations where separatrices, dividing domains of distinct connectivity, like
spines and fans (Longcope et al. 2007; Kazachenko et al. 2012) or quasi-separatrix layers (QSL, Savcheva et al. 2015, 2016)
intersect with the chromosphere. Until recently, limited accuracy of both vector-magnetic-ﬁeld and ribbon measurements made
systematic analysis of magnetic ﬁelds within ﬂare ribbons areas limited.

Figure 1. Standard ﬂare cartoon from Savcheva et al. (2016). As the ﬂux rope rises (gray), it stretches the current sheet and the QSLs in the
plane perpendicular to the ﬂux rope (red) forming a set of newly reconnected cusped and arcade-shaped ﬁeld lines (green and blue, respectively)
with footpoints, highlighted as ﬂare ribbons (yellow). Images on the right and bottom show the main observed features explained by the model:
(a) CME with three-part structure from SOHO/LASCO; (b) cusped loops from Yohkoh/SXT; (c) coronal dimmings from SDO/AIA; (d) ﬂare
ribbons from Hinode/SOT; and (e) ﬂare arcade from TRACE. Published with the author’s permission.

the ﬁrst time when both a vector magnetograph and ribbon-imaging capabilities became available on the same observing platform,
making co-registration of AIA and HMI full-disk data relatively easy. In this paper, we make use of these two instruments and
present a database of vector magnetic ﬁeld properties swept by ﬂare ribbons in 40 ﬂaring events, C-class and larger. Our intentions
are twofold. First, we provide the reference information for the data set by describing the key processing procedures. Second,

we present statistical analyses of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld participating in the ﬂare and their relationship with that of the
polarity inversion line (PIL) and the AR as a whole.

This paper follows the study of Kazachenko et al. (2017) that presented a RibbonDB database of 3137 solar ﬂare ribbon
events, their ribbon area and ribbon magnetic ﬂuxes (reconnection ﬂuxes). Complementing our previous study, here we create
a new dataset, FlareMagDB, and describe the vector magnetic ﬁelds properties: magnetic ﬂux, mean magnetic shear, vertical
current and the net current within ﬂare ribbons, AR and PIL areas.

This paper is organized as follows. In §2, we describe the SDO data we use, the list of selected events, and the methods. In
§4, we describe statistical results of the FlareMagDB analysis. In §5, we describe the results of the analysis of the 3D MHD
ARMS simulation. Finally, in §6 and §7, we discuss the results and summarize conclusions.

In this section, we describe the data and the methods we used to identify various physical properties of the AR magnetic ﬁeld:
identiﬁcation of the polarity inversion line (PILs), ﬂare ribbons and AR areas; estimates of the magnetic ﬂuxes, shears, vertical
currents and net currents within PIL, ribbons and AR areas.

2. DATA AND METHODS

2.1. Data

We have assembled a FlareMagDB catalogue that includes 40 ﬂares: 10 X-, 28 M- and 2 C-class ﬂares (see Table 1). To
give an overview of these 40 events, in Figure 2 we show vertical magnetic ﬁeld maps of 40 ARs hosting these ﬂares. Out of
40 events, 33 were associated with CMEs (eruptive) and 7 were not associated with CMEs (conﬁned, 2 C-, 2 M- and 3 X-class
ﬂares, Yashiro et al. 2006). To select our 40 events we used the RibbonDB ﬂare ribbon catalogue that described reconnection
ﬂux properties of 3137 ﬂares (Kazachenko et al. 2017). Our main selection criteria was choosing a sample of events spanning a
wide range of AR and reconnection ﬂuxes of ﬂare class M1.0 and above, representative of the medium and strong ﬂares of the
RibbonDB catalogue. Figure 3 compares FlareMagDB events with events from the RibbonDB: it shows scatter plots of the
peak X-ray ﬂux vs. unsigned AR, ribbon and PIL magnetic ﬂuxes for events in both databases.

For each event in the database, we use 1) a pre-ﬂare HMI/SDO vector magnetogram of dsHMI = 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) spatial resolution,
B(x, y) = (Bx, By, Bz)(x, y), to ﬁnd magnetic ﬁeld properties before the ﬂare and 2) a sequence of AIA 1600 ˚A images, of
dt1600 = 24s cadence and ds1600 = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)61 angular resolution, I1600(x, y, t), to ﬁnd areas that have been swept up by ﬂare
ribbons during the course of the ﬂare (i.e. cumulative ribbon masks, see Kazachenko et al. 2017). For the magnetic ﬁeld we
used a full-disk vector magnetogram data set from the 135-seconds series (Sun et al. 2017, hmi.B_135S). To disambiguate the
azimuth orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld we used the radial acute disambiguation method (Hoeksema et al. 2014). We process
the UV 1600 ˚A images in IDL using the aia_prep.pro SolarSoft package and co-align the AIA image sequence in time
with the ﬁrst frame. We use aia_prep.pro to align HMI vector magnetic ﬁelds maps with the AIA image sequence. In
all magnetic ﬁeld calculations, we set to zero the components of the vector magnetic ﬁeld B, where |Bz| < 20G. This noise
threshold is chosen experimentally to remove areas outside the AR (Hoeksema et al. 2014). For ﬁnding PILs, we ﬁrst smooth
the input magnetic ﬁeld with a Gaussian function with a window size of 2 pixels, then isolate areas where vertical magnetic ﬁeld
|Bz| > 200G and ﬁnally dilate areas of positive and negative ﬂux with a window size of 8 pixels. This procedure results in PILs
that are roughly 8 AIA pixels or ≈ 3500km wide. We notice that some of the derived PILs are not directly related to the ﬂaring
regions – there are few false PILs in the isolated-sunspots penumbra and also PILs that lie away from the ﬂares; however the areas
and ﬂuxes of these PILs do not contribute signiﬁcant amounts of ﬂux in our analysis and we thus do not exclude them. To account
for noise in the weak transverse component of B, we set (Bx, By) = 0, where |Bh| < 200G. We deﬁne the AR region-of-interest
(ROI) as a 800 × 800-pixels, or a 390(cid:48)(cid:48) × 390(cid:48)(cid:48), rectangle centered on the AR. We chose the rectangle big enough to include the
AR as a whole and small enough to exclude neighboring ARs. We derive the coordinates of the AR center from the Heliophysics
Event Catalogue (HEC) maintained by the INAF-Trieste Astronomical Observatory.

2.2. Methods: Analyzed physical variables

We use HMI/SDO photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld maps in Cartesian coordinates, B(x, y) = (Bx, By, Bz)(x, y), to ﬁnd the
following pre-ﬂare magnetic ﬁeld properties: the potential component of the magnetic ﬁeld, Bp = (Bp
y , Bz), the magnetic
shear, α(x, y) (Petrie 2019; Wang et al. 2017; Gosain & Venkatakrishnan 2010) and the vertical electric current density, Jz(x, y)
(Liu et al. 2017):

Figure 2. Vertical magnetic ﬁeld maps, Bz, for 40 events from the FlareMagDB database. Cyan color shows PIL areas. Orange color shows
cumulative ribbon areas. Labels above each ﬁgure combine event’s index in the database, ﬂare start time, NOAA active region number and the
GOES peak X-ray ﬂux. “Eruptive/conﬁned” label indicates whether the event is eruptive or conﬁned. Black, orange and cyan numbers indicate
total magnetic ﬂux within AR, ribbon and PIL areas, respectively, in units of 1020 Mx (see column Φ in Table 1). Here and in Figures 11 and
12, we zoom into the ROI’s ﬁeld-of-view to highlight the AR structure.

To calculate the potential ﬁeld Bp, we used the poloidal-toroidal decomposition of the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld (see
Appendix A in Fisher et al. 2010).

From the above quantities we then ﬁnd the following area-integrated physical quantities: the unsigned and the averaged between
positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes (Φu and Φ), the total area (S), the mean shear (¯α), and the unsigned vertical current (Iz,u):

where dS is the area of integration and “+” and “−” subscripts refer to integration over positive and negative polarities, respec-
tively. To describe physical quantities within PIL, ribbon and AR areas we separately integrate over three areas of interest (dS):
area of the active region (AR, |Bz| > 20G), area swept by the ﬂare ribbons (rbn, |Bz| > 20G) and area within the magnetic
polarity inversion line (PIL). We only consider areas where |Bh| > 200G to calculate ¯α and Iz,u.

In addition to describe the fraction of the AR undergoing magnetic reconnection, we use the percentage of the ribbon-to-AR

magnetic ﬂuxes as ﬁrst described in Kazachenko et al. (2017):

RΦ =

× 100%.

To estimate the net current we follow the steps below. We ﬁrst integrate Jz values of different signs in each polarity separately
and compute the direct (DC) and return (RC) currents in each polarity (Liu et al. 2017; Schmieder & Aulanier 2018). To associate
the correct sign of Jz to the DC (and hence to the RC), we ﬁnd the dominant sign of helicity, H, handedness/sign (or Jz/Bz)
of the AR as a whole. To deﬁne handedness we use orientation of the coronal loops from the coronal images relative to the
ﬁeld orientation of the AR from the magnetogram. Knowing the correct sign for DC (and RC), we then calculate DC and RC in
positive and negative polarities, (|DC|+ and |RC|+) and (|DC|− and |RC|−), respectively. For right-handed AR with positive
helicity (H > 0):

To describe CMEs associated with the eruptive events in the FlareMagDB, we include CME speeds from Yashiro et al. 2006

2.3. Methods: Uncertainties

To estimate the uncertainties in the observed quantities in Eqs. 4-12, we calculate their differences within positive (“+”) and
negative (“−”) magnetic polarities. Since for an isolated active region opposite polarities correspond to the footpoints of a
single magnetic ﬂux system, estimates within opposite polarities should be equal within the observational errors.1 Adopting this
hypothesis, we deﬁne the error proxies for signed magnetic ﬂuxes, mean shears, total vertical currents and the net currents in the
following way:

∆Φ =

|Φ+| − |Φ−|

From the way we construct these metrics we expect that for ideal measurements these error proxies should be zero.

2.4. Statistical Analysis
To quantitatively describe the relationship between different properties of ﬂares and ARs, e.g. X and Y, we use Spearman
ranking correlation coefﬁcient, rs(X, Y) (see Figure 5). Unlike the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient that is used to measure linear
relationship between variables—and therefore is not optimal for non-linearly related variables—the Spearman rank correlation
provides a measure of a monotonic relationship between variables. We describe the qualitative strength of the correlation using
the following guide for the absolute value of rs (Kazachenko et al. 2017): rs ∈ [0.2, 0.39] – weak, rs ∈ [0.4, 0.59] – moderate,
rs ∈ [0.6, 0.79] – strong, and rs ∈ [0.8, 1.0] – very strong. When the correlation coefﬁcient is moderate or greater (rs(X, Y) >
0.4), we ﬁt the relationship between X and Y with a power-law function

Y = aXb .

(15)

We use Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares minimization method to ﬁnd the scaling factor a and exponent b.

1 We note that our shear parameter does not obey any conservation principle. Also, our PIL algorithm does not enforce balance in either ﬂux or current. Nonetheless,
we do not expect substantial imbalances in these quantities, so it is plausible to use excursions from zero in these quantities to indicate large uncertainties, perhaps
arising from systematic effects.

In this section we ﬁrst show results of the magnetic ﬁeld analysis within PIL, ribbon and AR areas for an example AR 12158
(§4.1, Figure 4). We then describe results of the statistical analysis for 40 events of the FlareMagDB: magnetic ﬂux (§4.2), ﬂux
ratio (§4.3), magnetic shear (§4.4) and total and net currents (§4.5). Table 1 contains the list of all the variables for 40 events.
Table 2 and Figure 5 show variables’ typical range and correlation matrix between 18 FlareMagDB variables.

4.1. FlareMagDB example event: X1.6 ﬂare in AR 12158

Figure 4. Example of an X1.6 ﬂare on September 10 2014 in AR 12158 from the FlareMagDB database: clockwise from upper left, vertical
and horizontal components of the magnetic ﬁeld, magnetic shear and the vertical current density before the ﬂare. Orange and blue contours
outline ribbon and PIL areas, respectively. Black and blue arrows show observed and potential components of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld.
See §4.1.

Figure 4 shows an example of our analysis for one event in the FlareMagDB database, an X1.6 ﬂare on September 10 2014
in AR 12158 (event number i = 29 in Table 1). Four panels show vertical and horizontal magnetic ﬁeld components, shear
and current density maps right before the ﬂare. Orange contours indicate areas swept by the ﬂare ribbon. Cyan contours show
locations of the PILs. In Table 1 we show the results of the quantitative analysis for this event (marked with “+”) and all the other
FlareMagDB events. From the magnetic ﬂux analysis we ﬁnd that the AR magnetic ﬂux is ΦAR = 154×1020M x, the magnetic
ﬂux swept by ﬂare ribbons is Φrbn = 60 × 1020M x, and the PIL magnetic ﬂux is ΦPIL = 2.7 × 1020M x (Figure 4a). We ﬁnd
that the mean shear is largest within the PIL area gradually decreasing within the ribbon and AR areas (¯αPIL = 24.6 × 103G · deg
vs. ¯αribbon = 16.5 × 103G · deg and ¯αAR = 13.1 × 103G · deg), which corresponds to ﬁeld being increasingly sheared as we
go from AR to ribbon and PIL areas. In 4(c) we can see this transition from the most yellow, or largest-shear areas, near the
cyan PILs to bluer, i.e smaller-shear areas, outside the ribbon and PIL contours in the AR as a whole (Figure 4b,c). As for the

Figure 5. FlareMagDB Correlation matrix: Spearman correlation coefﬁcients, rs, between variables of FlareMagDB, X. Here X is either
magnetic ﬂux, ribbon-to-AR fraction of magnetic ﬂux, mean magnetic shear, total current, mean current, net current within AR, ribbon and PIL
areas, GOES peak X-ray ﬂux or CME speed. Colors correspond to the strength of the correlation coefﬁcient, rs, between each variable pair. We
verbally describe the strength of the correlation using the following guide for the absolute value of rs: rs = [0.2, 0.39] – weak, rs = [0.4, 0.59]
– moderate, rs = [0.6, 0.79] – strong and rs = [0.8, 1.0] – very strong correlation.

net vertical current, that describes current neutralization, we ﬁnd that the current is non-neutralized within separate polarities,
increasing from AR to PIL areas: |DC/RC|[AR, rbn, PIL] = [1.2, 1.6, 1.6]. In 4d we see this current imbalance as preferred
current colors in opposite magnetic polarities – notice how current is more violet within positive ribbon (orange contour in the
top right) and more green within negative ribbon (bottom left).

4.2. FlareMagDB Statistics: Magnetic ﬂux

Figure 2 shows vertical magnetic ﬁeld maps, Bz(x, y), of 40 events in the FlareMagDB database. Does the geometry of PIL
affect where ﬂare ribbons of the next ﬂare would be? Does a stronger PIL necessarily mean that the ﬂare ribbons of the next ﬂare
would lie close to PIL? According to the standard ﬂare model, ribbons should never cross PILs and should lie on both sides of
the PIL at a distance deﬁned by the reconnection process and the structure of the pre-ﬂare coronal magnetic ﬁeld. We examine
spatial distribution of cyan and orange contours showing PIL and ribbon areas (see Figure 2). We ﬁnd that ribbons and PIL-masks
generally sample different parts of the ARs. For example, for the 10 strongest ﬂares, X-class and above, only 3 X-class ﬂares
have ribbons lying close to strong PIL areas (i = 1, 3, 9). In the other 7 X-class ﬂares, ribbons lie away from strong PIL areas
(i = 13, 20, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37). From this comparison we conclude that while large amounts of near-PIL ﬂux indicate a large ﬂare
is more likely, the morphology of PILs has almost no bearing on the morphology of ﬂare ribbons. We then use these Bz(x, y)
maps to ﬁnd unsigned and averaged between opposite polarities vertical magnetic ﬂuxes, Φu and Φ (Eq. 3-4), for each event
within the AR, ribbon and PIL areas (see contours).

Figure 3 shows scatter plots of pre-ﬂare unsigned magnetic ﬂuxes, Φu (see Eq. 3), within AR, reconnection and PIL area
vs. peak X-ray ﬂux for each event in the FlareMagDB database. Rainbow color corresponds to events from the 3137-ﬂares
RibbonDB catalogue (n = 3137, Kazachenko et al. 2017). Red color shows a subset of 40 FlareMagDB events selected in this

paper. For events from the FlareMagDB we ﬁnd a moderate correlation between the unsigned AR ﬂux and the ﬂare peak X-ray
ﬂux. This correlation is stronger than the correlation found for RibbonDB: Spearman correlation coefﬁcient rs = 0.5 for n = 40
vs. rs = 0.2 for n = 3137 (left plot). We also ﬁnd a strong correlation between the unsigned reconnection ﬂux and the ﬂare peak
X-ray ﬂux: rs = 0.8 for n = 40 vs. rs = 0.7 for n = 3137 (middle plot). We explain the difference in correlation coefﬁcients
between a subsample of n = 40 events and the full sample of n = 3137 by the high heterogeneity of the full RibbonDB dataset.
We also note that using Hα dataset from the Kanzelhohe Observatory instead of the AIA/SDO observations, Tschernitz et al.
2018 found stronger correlations (rs = 0.9) in agreement with our ﬁndings here. Finally, we ﬁnd a strong correlation between
the PIL vertical magnetic ﬂux and the ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux: rs = 0.6 (right plot).

In Figure 6a we show AR, ribbon and PIL magnetic ﬂuxes averaged between opposite polarities, Φ vs. the peak X-ray ﬂux for
the FlareMagDB alone (see Eq. 4). By deﬁnition, these averaged ﬂuxes are around 2-times smaller than unsigned ﬂuxes from
Figure 3. We ﬁnd that the ﬂare size is moderately correlated with the AR magnetic ﬂux and the strength of the PIL and very
strongly correlated with the amount of reconnecting magnetic ﬂux. In Table 2 we describe the typical range of AR, ribbon and
PIL ﬂuxes consistent with earlier results (Kazachenko et al. 2017).

In Figure 5 we show the Spearman correlation coefﬁcients between AR, ribbon and PIL ﬂuxes and other FlareMagDB
variables, the correlation matrix. We ﬁnd very strong correlations (rs > 0.8) between magnetic ﬂux and total current within PIL.
Note that PIL and AR ﬂuxes have weaker correlation with the Peak X-ray ﬂux than the ribbon reconnection ﬂux. We discuss
these relationships further in §6.

4.3. FlareMagDB Statistics: Reconnection Flux Fraction

In Figure 6b we show the fraction of the magnetic ﬂux participating in the ﬂare, RΦ (see Eq 7) vs. the peak X-ray ﬂux. We
ﬁnd that RΦ has a moderate correlation with the peak X-ray ﬂux (rs = 0.5). The reconnection ﬂux fraction has the typical range
of 8.3% to 20.1%, consistent with previous results (Kazachenko et al. 2017).

4.4. FlareMagDB Statistics: Magnetic Shear

Figure 11 in Appendix A shows magnetic shear maps, α(x, y), for all events of the database. From these maps we ﬁnd that the
spatial structure of the magnetic shear highly varies for different events. To understand these variations in a quantitative way, we
use individual shear maps to ﬁnd the mean magnetic shear, ¯α, within the AR as a whole, ribbon and PIL areas (see Eq. 1).

Figure 6c shows the mean magnetic shear vs. the peak X-ray ﬂux. We ﬁnd that the mean magnetic shear in AR, ribbon and
PIL areas is [10, 18, 26] × 103G · deg with the 20th to 80th percentile of [8.2, 12.9] × 103G · deg, [14.2, 21.7] × 103G · deg and
[18.3, 34.9] × 103G · deg, respectively (see Table 2). In other words, as we go from the AR as a whole to ribbon and PIL areas,
the magnetic ﬁeld becomes stronger and more sheared. In addition, we ﬁnd that the peak X-ray ﬂux has a strong correlation with
the mean magnetic shear within the AR and weak to moderate correlations with the mean magnetic shear within PIL and ribbon
areas.

4.5. FlareMagDB Statistics: Vertical Current and Net Current

Figure 12 in Appendix A shows vertical current density maps, Jz(x, y), for all events of the database. Zooming in into individ-
ual Jz images, we see that the vertical current density consists of long and short structures, or “threads” and “patches”, of violet

and green colors that correspond to positive and negative vertical currents. While we ﬁnd elongated thread structures in some
events, e.g. events i = 1 (01_20110215_0144_11158_X2.2), i = 22 (22_20140201_0714_11967_M3.0) or i = 36
(36_20141218_2141_12241_M6.9), from our limited sample we do not ﬁnd any relationship between the presence of these
structures and occurrence of large ﬂares or CMEs (see e.g. a non-thread-like event 29_2014_0910_1721_12158_X1.6,
where an X1.6 occurred with a CME). Instead we ﬁnd that the current density maps have all kinds of shapes of varying size that
are not related to ﬂare size or ﬂare/CME productivity.

To quantify the global properties of Jz, we use Jz maps to compute the total unsigned vertical current, Iz,u, direct current

(DC), return current (RC) and their ratio, or net current, |DC/RC| as described in Eqns. 6-12.

Figure 6d shows the scatter plot between the total unsigned vertical current and the peak X-ray ﬂux before the ﬂare within
PIL, ribbon and AR areas. We ﬁnd that the total unsigned vertical current is largest within AR areas decreasing gradually within
ribbon and PIL areas. This relationship is not surprising and reﬂects the decreasing area of integration as we go from AR to
ribbon and PIL areas. Comparing Figure 6a and Figure 6d, i.e. the vertical-magnetic-ﬂux and the total-vertical-current scatter
plots, we see similar scattering with the peak X-ray ﬂux. The Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between the peak X-ray ﬂux and
the total vertical current ranges from weak for ARs to strong for ribbon and PIL areas.

In Figure 7 we describe the imbalance of the vertical current within each magnetic polarity, the net current, in AR, ribbon and
PIL areas and compare these to various magnetic ﬁeld properties. Our objective here is to understand the cause of the net current.
In Figure 7a we compare the |DC/RC| with the peak X-ray ﬂux. We ﬁnd that |DC/RC| and the ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux have

weak correlation, implying that the net current is not related to how large the next ﬂare might be. We ﬁnd that the net current is
larger within PILs, than within ribbons and separate AR polarities ( |DC/RC| = [1.1, 1.5, 1.7] within ARs, ribbons and PILs,
respectively), i.e. the current is more non-neutralized within ribbons’ than within AR’s polarities. If we look not at the separate
polarities but at the AR as a whole, we ﬁnd that |DC/RC| ≈ 1, i.e the current is neutralized.

To understand the cause of the net current, in Figure 7b we compare the pre-ﬂare mean shear with the net current within ﬂare
ribbons. We ﬁnd a strong correlation between the net current within ribbons and the mean shear within the PIL. Using a linear
function we ﬁnd the (13 ± 3)x + (6 ± 5) relationship between the two and a Spearman correlation coefﬁcient of 0.7. We ﬁnd a
similar relationship between the AR net current and the PIL shear, with a slightly weaker correlation coefﬁcient. What does this
relationship imply? It implies that the net current is a manifestation of the magnetic shear at the PIL.

4.6. FlareMagDB Statistics: Conﬁned vs. Eruptive Events

We analyze magnetic ﬁeld properties of 7 conﬁned events, that did not cause CMEs (marked with (cid:52)s in Figure 6 and Figure 7),
and compare them with 33 eruptive events, that caused CMEs (marked with •s). 7 conﬁned events originated in 5 ARs, including
3 X-class ﬂares, X3.1, X1.6 and X1.0, originating in the AR 12192 (Sun et al. 2015).

Comparing conﬁned vs. eruptive events, we ﬁnd several differences in their magnetic ﬁeld properties. First, we ﬁnd that for
ﬂares within a certain peak-X-ray-class range, conﬁned events have larger PIL magnetic ﬂuxes than eruptive events (Figure 6a).
Second, we ﬁnd that conﬁned events have smaller PIL-shear and ribbon net current than eruptive events (cf. (cid:52) vs. •). Third, we
ﬁnd that the reconnection ﬂux fraction, RΦ, tends to be smaller for conﬁned events than for eruptive events (Figure 6b). If we look
at eruptive events alone, we ﬁnd that their reconnection ﬂux fractions strongly correlate with the CME speeds, rs(rΦ, vCME) =
0.6. In fact, among all FlareMagDB variables, it is the reconnection ﬂux fraction that has the strongest correlation with the
CME speed. In Figure 8 we plot the CME speed vs. the FlareMagDB variables that have the highest correlation coefﬁcients
with the CME speed, peak X-ray ﬂux, AR net current and the reconnection ﬂux fraction. To summarize, we ﬁnd that while PIL
shear and the net current have weak to moderate correlation with the CME speed, the reconnection ﬂux fraction has a strong
correlation with the CME speed, i.e.
the properties of the ﬁeld of the ﬂux rope play smaller role in the CME speed that the
properties of ﬂux rope relative the overlying ﬁeld.

We note that our analysis of ﬁeld properties within conﬁned and eruptive events is based on 33 eruptive and only 7 conﬁned
events. Analysis of a larger data sample with equal numbers of conﬁned and eruptive events would be necessary to draw more
certain conclusions.

5. RESULTS: 3D MHD ARMS SIMULATIONS

To provide theoretical ground for our observational ﬁndings, here we present the same observational analysis on the results of
a 3D MHD simulation of an idealized magnetic breakout CME (Antiochos et al. 1999; Lynch et al. 2008) that forms a large-scale
post-eruption arcade below an energetic ﬂux rope (FR) eruption. We note, that while the simulation’s AR magnetic ﬂux is similar
to a ﬂux of the medium active region, the mean magnetic ﬁeld strengths (and AR size) are about 100 times smaller (larger) in the
simulations than observed. Using the scaling law between the reconnection ﬂux and the peak X-ray ﬂux, we conclude that the
simulation’s reconnection ﬂux corresponds to an M1.0-class ﬂare.

5.1. Model Details and Initial Conditions

The 3D MHD simulation was performed with the Adaptively Reﬁned MHD Solver (ARMS; DeVore & Antiochos 2008). The
simulation is a left-handed Lynch et al. (2009) conﬁguration, energized with a pair of idealized shearing ﬂows parallel to the
active region PIL.

The magnetic ﬁeld at t = 0 hr is initiated via a sum of point dipoles,

i/r(cid:48)

The base pressure and temperature are given by p0 = 0.025 dyn cm−2 and T0 = 1.9433 × 106 K, respectively, while the
initial solar atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium with p(r) = p0 (r/R(cid:12))−µ, T (r) = T0 (r/R(cid:12))−1, p = 2(ρ/mp)kBT , and
µ = R(cid:12)/H(cid:12) = 12.0 is the normalized (inverse) scale height. This yields a base mass density of ρ0 = 7.80 × 10−17 g cm−3
corresponding to a base number density of n0 = 4.6634 × 107 cm−3.

The computation grid is block decomposed with an initial resolution of 5 × 5 × 5 blocks covering the full domain of r ∈
[1R(cid:12), 20R(cid:12)], θ ∈ [0.0625π, 0.9375π] (latitude of ±78.75◦) and φ ∈ [−0.5π, +0.5π]. Each block contains 83 grid cells
and we have employed 4 additional levels of static grid reﬁnement. The highest-reﬁned region covers r ∈ [1R(cid:12), 6R(cid:12)], θ ∈
[0.32π, 0.55π] (latitude of [−9.0◦, +32.4◦]) and φ ∈ [−0.18π, +0.18π] with an effective resolution of 3203. Thus, the highest-
reﬁned grid cells have a 0.49◦ × 0.56◦ angular resolution in (θ, φ) and ∆r = 0.0188R(cid:12) at the lower boundary.

The energizing boundary ﬂows impart a signiﬁcant shear component (Bφ) to the active region as each polarity concentration is

moved further apart. The form of the Lynch et al. (2009) shearing ﬂows are

where (±) represents the ﬂows applied to the positive and negative polarities, respectively, for the duration t ∈ [0, 2.778] hr. The
function f (±)(θ, φ) smoothly ramps the ﬂow proﬁle to zero outside of speciﬁed (θ, φ) ranges on either side of the PIL, described
in Lynch et al. (2009). The magnitude of the shearing ﬂows v0 = 65 km s−1 is signiﬁcantly faster than observed photospheric
velocities but below the sound speed (c0 ∼ 180 km s−1) and extremely sub-Alfv´enic (vA (cid:38) 2000 km s−1) in the vicinity of the
AR.

The magnetic breakout model for CME initiation relies on the positive feedback process associated with reconnection at a
current sheet above the source region’s expanding sheared core (Antiochos et al. 1999; Lynch et al. 2008). The arcade expansion

accelerates as the restraining over-lying ﬂux is transferred into the adjacent arcades of the AR multipolar ﬂux system. Reconnec-
tion at the breakout current sheet drives the initial stages of the eruption and leads to the transition from slow quasi-ideal evolution
to a driven, runaway conﬁguration that forms a vertical current sheet below the expanding sheared ﬁeld core. This current sheet
thins and elongates with continued expansion and, with the onset of the fast CSHKP eruptive ﬂare reconnection, ushers in the
explosive acceleration phase of the CME eruption (e.g. DeVore & Antiochos 2008; Karpen et al. 2012; Lynch & Edmondson
2013; Dahlin et al. 2019; Wyper et al. 2021).

Figure 9 shows a snapshot of the simulation results during the CME eruption. Panel 9a shows the ﬁeld lines of the post-
eruption ﬂare arcade in the very beginning of the eruption (t = 2.71 hr), and panel 9b shows the temporal evolution of total
magnetic energy, kinetic energy, ﬂare reconnection ﬂux, and reconnection rate. To focus on changes of the magnetic energy
during the eruption we have set the magnetic energy at t = 0 to zero: EM (t = 0) = 0. The amount of the total released
the EM decrease from 2 to 5hr, is ∆EM ∼ 6 × 1030 erg, which roughly corresponds to the change
magnetic energy, i.e.
in the free magnetic energy. The kinetic energy exhibits two stages of evolution. During the initial stage from 1 hr to 2.6 hr
the kinetic energy EK increases slowly corresponding to a slow quasi-ideal rise of the sheared core before the onset of ﬂare
reconnection. This expansion is initially caused by the force imbalance (magnetic pressure gradient) introduced with the sheared
ﬁeld component. During the second runaway stage, from 2.6 hr to 5 hr, EK increases much more rapidly corresponding to
the start of the breakout reconnection. Once the ﬂare reconnection starts, it becomes the dominant process driving the entire
subsequent evolution of the CME eruption (Karpen et al. 2012). By the end of the ﬂare at t = 5 hr, the kinetic energy reaches
a maximum of EK ∼ 1030 erg and the cumulative unsigned reconnection ﬂux reached Φrbn ∼ 1.8 × 1021 Mx. The maximum
reconnection rate is dΦrbn/dt ∼ 5.5 × 1017 Mx s−1 at t = 2.85 hr. The total fraction of the active region ﬂux that participated
in the ﬂare is 43% (Table 2).

5.3. Magnetic Field and Electric Current Properties in the AR, PIL, and Flare Ribbon Regions

To apply the observational analysis framework to the simulation results, we ﬁrst project the spherical magnetic ﬁeld components
into a Cartesian coordinate system where (x, y) represent the plane-of-the-sky (horizontal components) and z comes out of the
page towards the observer (vertical component). Next, we interpolate the simulation values onto a uniform 600 × 500 array
corresponding to the area shown in Figure 9a, i.e. x ∈ [−0.6R(cid:12), +0.6R(cid:12)], y ∈ [−0.25R(cid:12), +0.75R(cid:12)]. This yields a pixel area
dAij = ∆x∆y = 1.96 × 1016 cm2. From this data set, we calculate the magnetic shear α(x, y), vertical current density Jz(x, y),
and their respective averages over the regions of interest deﬁned in Section 2.2.

Figure 10 shows the ARMS simulation version of Figure 4 at t = 2.57 hr, right before the onset of the fast eruptive-ﬂare
reconnection. Figures 10a, b show the vertical and horizontal ﬁeld components with the cumulative, over the ﬂare duration,
ribbon and PIL areas denoted as the orange and cyan shading, respectively. Here the ribbon areas are calculated from a ﬁeld line
length proxy, as in Lynch et al. (2019, 2021). Figure 10c shows the distribution of shear and Figure 10d shows the distribution of
the vertical current density.

Table 2 shows a comparison of observed values from FlareMagDB with ARMS. The mean magnetic ﬂux in each region is
Φ(AR, rbn, P IL) = [4.1, 1.8, 0.03]×1021 Mx. The mean shear in each region is ¯α(AR, rbn, P IL) = [63, 129, 169]×(G·deg).
The total unsigned vertical current in each region is Iz,u(AR, rbn, P IL) = [2.7, 2.1, 0.03] × 1011 A. The net current in each
region is |DC/RC|(AR, rbn, P IL) = (4.9, 10.5, 3.1). Comparing these values with observations, ARMS magnetic ﬂuxes
correspond to a medium-size ﬂare in a medium-size active region. For example, an M1.0-class ﬂare in a sigmoidal AR (i = 0) of

ﬂux ,Φrbn, and reconnection rate, dΦrbn/dt. See §5.2 for details.

FlareMagDB has very similar AR, ribbon and PIL magnetic ﬂuxes. The size of the ARMS AR is much larger than any observed
case, therefore the magnetic ﬁelds are much weaker. Since the magnetic ﬁelds are much weaker, ARMS magnetic shears (which
is a product of the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude and the shear angle, θ) and total currents are much smaller than the observed ones.
We also ﬁnd that ARMS AR has very weak return currents, resulting in large net currents, which vary from 5 for a single polarity
to 10.5 within a ﬂare ribbon. For comparison, the observed ARs have smaller net currents ranging from 1 to 3, i.e. the return
currents in the observations are stronger. Note that before the eruption when we start shearing the arcade, there is direct current
close to PIL and a clear return-current shell separating the sheared from un-sheared components along the quasi-separatrix layer.
During the eruption the return current weakens as a result of peeling away of the outer layers of the expanding ﬂux system via
breakout reconnection.

To summarize, from ARMS analysis we ﬁnd the following: (1) Similar to observations, simulations’ mean magnetic shear
increases gradually from AR to ribbon and PIL areas. Simulations’ shear values are consistent with the observed ones, given 100-
times scaling relation between mean magnetic ﬁelds. (2) Similar to observations, the vertical electric currents within individual
polarities are highly non-neutralized, with the largest net currents located within areas involved in the eruption. Simulation’s net
currents are ≈ 5 times stronger than observed values. (3) We ﬁnd a close spatial relationship between the simulation’s magnetic
shear at PIL and the net current, conﬁrming the new net current-shear scaling law we ﬁnd from the observations.

6. DISCUSSION

We used HMI/SDO photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld observations in 40 ﬂares to assemble a FlareMagDB database with
properties of magnetic ﬁelds within AR, ﬂare ribbon and PIL areas. We analyzed pre-ﬂare observed magnetic ﬂux, reconnection
fraction, magnetic shear, total electric current and net current for 40 events and compared these with ﬂare X-ray peak ﬂux
(Figures 6 and 7) and CME speed (Figures 8). In Table 2 we summarized variables’ typical range and compared these with
synthetic variables from an MHD ARMS eruption simulation. In the Correlation Matrix in Figure 5 we investigated dependencies
between the variables. In this section we describe how our results complement existing understanding of ﬂare magnetism.

Ribbon vs. PIL Morphology: We compare spatial distribution of ribbons and PILs and ﬁnd that many ﬂares, including M5.0
and above, have ribbons lying away from the PIL. What does it imply? First, that for many events the morphology of PILs has
almost no bearing on the morphology of ﬂare ribbons. Second, that in these events low-lying magnetic ﬁelds that are rooted in
the vicinity of the PIL area do not participate in the ﬂare. How do these ideas ﬁt within the contention that large near-PIL ﬂuxes
indicate that a large ﬂare is more likely to occur (Schrijver 2007)? We explain this with the fact that the majority of events in our
list, 33 out of 40, have sigmoidal coronal structure (Canﬁeld et al. 2007; Savcheva et al. 2014). Sigmoid is a twisted FR embedded
in a surrounding ﬁeld. Savcheva et al. (2012a,b) analyzed the time-evolution of a sigmoid eruption and constructed a scenario
for the onset of the CME in sigmoidal regions: the pre-existing FR can develop into a CME as a consequence of reconnection

at a Hyperbolic Flux Tube (HFT) under the FR, which increases the magnetic ﬂux in the rope and at the same time weakens the
overlying magnetic arcade holding it down. Thus, tether-cutting reconnection is needed in the slow rise phase of the eruption,
and the torus instability is necessary to allow the CME eruption. On the other hand, presence of ribbons close to the PIL indicates
of either the presence of a low-lying pre-existing ﬂux rope or a creation of a FR during the ﬂare as a result of the reconnection of
the low-lying sheared magnetic ﬁelds (Kazachenko et al. 2012). A more detailed study of ﬂare ribbon vs. PIL position and PIL
properties relative to coronal structure would be helpful to advance our understanding of ﬂux rope formation.

Magnetic ﬂux: From the analysis of magnetic ﬂuxes we ﬁnd that ribbon and PIL ﬂuxes have strong correlation with the AR
ﬂux, implying that large PIL and ribbon ﬂuxes tend to occur in active regions with large magnetic ﬂuxes. We also ﬁnd that
magnetic ﬂuxes have moderate to strong correlation with other magnetic ﬁeld products like mean magnetic shear and the total
current. Speciﬁcally the correlation between the PIL ﬂux and the AR shear is very strong (rs = 0.8, see Correlation Matrix 5).
One possible scenario to explain this relationship – as the active region evolves and gets pushed by photospheric ﬂows, the AR
ﬁeld becomes more sheared and magnetic ﬂux piles up at PIL due to, for example, collisional shearing (Chintzoglou et al. 2019).
We ﬁnd strong correlation between the AR, ribbon and PIL magnetic ﬂuxes and the peak X-ray ﬂux (rs > 0.6). While strong,
correlation between the PIL ﬂux and the X-ray peak ﬂux is weaker than the correlation between the PIL ﬂux and the AR ﬂux
(rs = 0.6 vs. rs = 0.8). In other words, while correlation between PIL ﬂux and ﬂare size is in line with Schrijver (2007)
hypothesis that ﬂare-productive ARs tend to have stronger PILs (see also references in Georgoulis et al. 2019), this correlation
could reﬂect the fact that larger ARs have stronger PILs and hence host larger ﬂares. A study of small vs. large active regions
with the same amount of PIL ﬂux might be useful to ﬁnd out what plays the major role in the AR ﬂare production, the AR
ﬂux or the PIL ﬂux. We also ﬁnd a very strong correlation between the reconnection ﬂux and the peak X-ray ﬂux (rs = 0.9),
in agreement with earlier results for larger datasets (Kazachenko et al. 2017; Toriumi et al. 2017; Tschernitz et al. 2018). The
power law between the two quantities agrees with the Warren & Antiochos (2004) scaling from hydrodynamic simulations of

impulsively heated ﬂare loops, proving that the soft X-ray radiation energy released during the ﬂare comes from the free magnetic
energy released during reconnection (Kazachenko et al. 2017).

Magnetic ﬂux fractions: We ﬁnd that fractions have a moderate correlation with the peak X-ray ﬂux (rs = 0.5) that is weaker
than correlation between the ribbon ﬂux and the peak X-ray ﬂux. This result is in agreement with Kazachenko et al. (2017)
(rs = 0.5) and Toriumi et al. (2017). We explain this relationship as a consequence of the way how we calculate the fractions
(RΦ = Φribbon
ΦAR

× 100%) and a very strong correlation between the ribbon ﬂux and the peak X-ray ﬂux.

Mean magnetic shear: The amount of magnetic shear at PIL is known to be related to the ﬂare productivity of an active region.
Here, as noted above, we ﬁnd that the amount of magnetic shear within the active region is most strongly correlated with the ﬂux
at PIL which in turn is strongly correlated with AR magnetic ﬂux. The larger is the active region, the larger is the amount of shear
it contains and more ﬂux it has at PIL. Is the amount of shear related to ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux? From our analysis, we ﬁnd that it is
not the case – mean magnetic shear has weak to moderate correlation with the peak X-ray ﬂux that is weaker than the correlation
between magnetic ﬂux and the peak X-ray ﬂux. For example, while PIL ﬂux correlates with the ﬂare size (rs = 0.6), increased
PIL shear does not correlate with AR ﬂare size (rs = 0.2). We also ﬁnd that this correlation decreases from ARs to ribbons and
PILs. As we go further from the PIL, we get less sheared magnetic ﬁelds, consistent with the standard 3D ﬂare model (Janvier
et al. 2014; Savcheva et al. 2016). Analysis of many large ﬂares with large amount of PIL magnetic ﬂux and small amount of
shear at the PIL, such as for example an M8.7 ﬂare (i = 8, ΦPIL = 21.2) or an M6.5 (i = 15, ΦPIL = 11.7) would be interesting.
In several past investigations and in ongoing work, Savcheva et al. (2015, 2016); Janvier (2016); Karna et al. (2021) have
studied several of the active regions shown in Table 1, precisely, 2010-08-07 (i = 0), 2011-02-15 (i = 1), 2011-09-06 (i = 3),
2012-03-07 (i = 9), 2012-03-09 (i = 10), 2012-07-12 (i = 13), 2013-04-11 (i = 15) and 2014-10-22-25 (i = 31, 32, 33).
Speciﬁcally, Savcheva et al. (2015, 2016) studied an M1.0 ﬂare on 2010-08-07 (i=0) using a magnetofrictional (MF) evolution.
They found that ﬁrst reconnection happens under the ﬂux rope turning two J-shaped ﬁeld lines from the sheared arcade into an
S-shaped ﬁeld line that builds magnetic ﬂux in the ﬂux rope and produces ﬂare ﬁeld lines as a by-product. These ﬂare ﬁeld lines,
that match the observed ﬂare loops, initially lie close to the PIL and are highly sheared, carrying remnant shear of the ﬂux rope
shear, and sequentially, as the ﬂux rope goes up in height, less and less sheared loops form that are rooted farther and farther away
from the PIL (see cartoon in Fig 1. from Savcheva et al. 2016). This scenario, using MF simulation, supports data-constrained
MHD simulation by Kliem et al. (2013) and also the observed large to small shear transition from PIL to ribbon areas that we
ﬁnd here.

Spatial structure of the vertical current density: What is the spatial structure of vertical current density and does it have any
relationship with the ability of the AR to host a CME vs. a conﬁned event? Recent works suggest that CME-eruptive ARs exhibit
deﬁned ﬁlamentary structures or ribbons in the current density maps while CME-quiet ARs do not (see e.g. Figure 3 of Avallone
& Sun 2020). Some observed case studies and simulations suggested that a hook-shaped pattern in these ﬁlaments could be a
signature of the pre-existing ﬂux rope (Schmieder & Aulanier 2018; Janvier 2016; Barczynski et al. 2020). Do we see direct
current ribbon pairs aligned with PIL before an AR hosts a CME (similar to the q = 0.8 case in Sun & Cheung 2021)? Do
these current ribbons have hook shapes? To answer this question we examine FlareMagDB current density maps in Figure 12.
First, we notice that few of these events have a clear hook shape. I.e. while hooks might be a signature of a pre-existing ﬂux
rope, hook presence is a rare phenomenon. Second, we ﬁnd that while some eruptive events are associated with distinct current
ribbon pairs close to PIL, others do not have these current ribbon pairs, instead consisting of salt-an-pepper patterns of positive
and negative current density. For example, AR 11158 (i = 1, eruptive X2.2 ﬂare) and AR 12241 (i = 36, eruptive M6.9 ﬂare)
have clear current ribbon pairs, while AR 11944 (i = 20, eruptive X1.2 ﬂare) does not have current ribbons. Does it mean that
eruptive events that do not have current ribbons are all in-situ formed ﬂux ropes, i.e. ﬂux ropes that were primarily formed during
reconnection? Finally, we ﬁnd that all seven conﬁned events in our list do not have current ribbons. This result is consistent with
earlier works and the scenario that lack of current ribbons might be related to absence of the pre-existing ﬂux rope and as a result
smaller likelihood of the ﬂare to erupt. We conclude that a more detailed morphological study of Jz patterns in ARs hosting
eruptive and conﬁned events with analysis of pre-ﬂare coronal images to track FR existence is needed to clarify the relationship
between Jz morphology and the AR ability to erupt.

We also calculate the total and mean vertical current within AR, ribbon and PIL areas. We ﬁnd that the total vertical current
increases as we go from PIL to AR areas, reﬂecting larger integration areas. On the other hand, the mean current decreases from
PIL to AR areas, since within PIL and ribbon areas magnetic ﬁelds are much more non-potential than in the AR as a whole.

Net current within AR, ribbons and PILs: Understanding how currents are neutralized is important for numerical models of
solar eruptions (see introduction in T¨or¨ok et al. (2014) paper). If we look at the AR as a whole, we ﬁnd that |DC/RC| ≈ 1,
i.e the current is neutralized, in agreement with previous studies (Wheatland 2000; Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari 2009; Georgoulis
et al. 2012b). On the other hand, individual polarities contain a net current. This net current varies from 1 to 3 and is largest in

18

the central part of the active region, around PIL and ribbon areas, decreasing gradually within the polarity as a whole (an AR
net current). In the simulations, net currents are larger but exhibit similar growth from the periphery to the center of the AR. For
example, using ARMS simulations, here we ﬁnd net currents reaching up to 5 within individual AR polarities and 10 within the
ribbon areas. For a simulation of an emerging active region, T¨or¨ok et al. (2014) found net currents reaching up to 5, increasing as
an AR emerges, consistent with pre-ﬂare ARMS values. Titov et al. (2008) and Aulanier et al. (2010) in their MHD simulations
also found weak return currents with net currents around 3, similar to observed values we ﬁnd here with FlareMagDB.

What creates these net currents? Net currents could emerge bodily into the corona (”emergence”, e.g. Leka et al. 1996;
Longcope & Welsch 2000) or be produced by stressing of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld by sub-photospheric and photospheric
shearing ﬂows (“shear”, e.g. McClymont & Fisher 1989; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2003; Aulanier et al. 2010). From our statistical
analysis we ﬁnd that the net current within each AR polarity (or ribbons) is proportional to magnetic shear at PIL, with most
of the direct current lying in the PIL vicinity. In other words, net current is a manifestation of the magnetic shear at the PIL.
This conclusion is in agreement with recent ﬁndings using simulations (Dalmasse et al. 2015; T¨or¨ok et al. 2014) and one-case
morphological studies using observations (Ravindra et al. 2011; Georgoulis et al. 2012a; Vemareddy 2015; Liu & Schuck 2012).
T¨or¨ok et al. (2014); Dalmasse et al. (2015) found that net currents are co-temporal with surge of shear at PIL and can be formed
due to ﬂux emergence, twisting and shearing motions and any mechanism that can generate magnetic shear along a PIL. Using
high-resolution vector magnetograms from the Spectropolarimeter/Hinode instrument of an emerging AR over several days,
Ravindra et al. (2011) noticed that net current within individual polarities could be related to shear at PIL. In a different study,
Venkatakrishnan & Tiwari (2009) found that non-sheared PILs have zero net current. In this paper we perform a ﬁrst quantitative
analysis of a fairly large observations dataset and ﬁnd that the net current is proportional to shear at PIL. This ﬁnding is expected
from the integral form of the Amp`ere’s law, (cid:72) B · dl = (4π/c)I. While along the PIL (cid:72) B · dl > 0, along the curved segment
away from the PIL, (cid:72) B · dl ≈ 0. The presence of net current in our sample of ARs supports previous studies that state that return
currents get trapped under the photosphere during ﬂux emergence, leading to the presence of a net current causing increased
shear at PIL. Our results also conﬁrm that coronal ﬂux rope models that neglect return currents are a valid representation of
pre-eruption conﬁgurations on the Sun.

Conﬁned vs. eruptive ﬂares: Here we ﬁnd that for a given X-ray ﬂux, conﬁned ﬂares have smaller reconnection ﬂux fractions,
RΦ, (cf. (cid:52) vs. • in Fig. 6b). If we go one step further and look not just at the ﬂare eruptivity, but at the CME speeds, we ﬁnd
that among all magnetic variables of FlareMagDB, reconnection ﬂux fraction is the only variable that has a strong correlation
with the CME speed ( rs = 0.6, see Correlation Matrix 5). Earlier, some indications of this relationship were suggested by
Tschernitz et al. (2018) and Toriumi et al. (2017); Li et al. (2020). Tschernitz et al. 2018 analyzed 51 ﬂares (32 conﬁned, 19
eruptive) ranging from GOES class B3 to X17. They found that conﬁned ﬂares of a certain GOES class have smaller ribbon
areas, but larger mean magnetic ﬁelds. This result implies that conﬁned ﬂares occur closer to the ﬂux-weighted center of ARs,
where ﬁelds that could be swept by the ﬂare ribbons could be stronger. In a different study, Toriumi et al. (2017); Li et al. (2020)
compared RΦ in conﬁned vs eruptive ﬂares, ﬁnding that eruptive events have on average larger ﬂux fractions. Here, instead of a
binary comparison between conﬁned and eruptive events properties, we for the ﬁrst time analyzed the CME speed. In Figure 8
we show the scatter plot of the CME speed vs. the reconnection fraction with the functional ﬁt of y = ax + b describing the
relationship, where a = 32 ± 9 and b = 290 ± 180 and R2 = 0.3. If correct, the new relationship between the CME speed and
the reconnection fraction could in principle be used to predict the CME speed once the solar ﬂare occurs.

How could we explain the correlation between the CME speed and the reconnection ﬂux fraction? We suggest the following
scenario. Once the ﬂare starts, reconnection starts feeding magnetic ﬂux into a pre-existing ﬂux rope or a sheared arcade. As
this new ﬂux rope forms, overlying ﬁelds within an AR provide a retrieving force to keep this ﬂux rope stable. As a result
the larger is the reconnection ﬂux fraction, the weaker is the restraining arcade above and the faster the new ﬂux rope erupts
reaching torus instability at a lower height (Chen et al. 2019; Kliem et al. 2021). The torus instability occurs when the overlaying
potential arcade decays with a critical index, ncrit = − dlnB
dlnz ≈ 1.1 − 1.5, depending on the ﬂux rope geometry and shear in
the overlaying arcade Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006). If the tension of the arcade above is not sufﬁcient, the ﬂux rope starts expanding,
thinning the reconnection current sheet further and causing more reconnection to take place. This scenario accounts for the slow
rise of ﬁlaments based on tether-cutting-like reconnection (Moore et al. 2001) and the fast eruption after the torus instability
kicks in. It is also in line with a recent observation analysis by Li et al. (2020); Li et al. (2021) who analyzed 322 and 719 ﬂares,
respectively, and found that the ﬂare-CME association rate decreases with the increasing magnetic ﬂux of the AR that produces
the ﬂare, implying that large magnetic ﬂux tends to conﬁne eruptions.

Physically reconnection ﬂux fraction represents the ratio between the ﬂux gained by the non-potential ﬂux rope to the total more
potential ﬂux of the active region. Lin et al. (2021) generalized this idea calling it “relative non-potentiality” of a magnetic ﬂux

TOWARD IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF MAGNETIC FIELDS PARTICIPATING IN SOLAR FLARES

rope. Consistent with the scenario above, a larger relative non-potentiality indicates a higher probability for a ﬂux rope to erupt.
§1 of Lin et al. (2021) contains a nice overview of a variety of schemes to quantitatively evaluate the relative non-potentiality.

We ﬁnd that all of the conﬁned events in our dataset have reconnection ﬂux fraction, RΦ < 15%, below the instability criteria,
RΦ,inst ≈ 30%, determined by the use of the ﬂux rope insertion method (Savcheva & van Ballegooijen 2009; Savcheva et al.
2012; Su et al. 2011). (For comparison, the typical 20th to 80th percentile for the reconnection ﬂux fraction in FlareMagDB
is RΦ[P20, P80] = [8.2, 20.1]% and the ARMS value is RΦ ≈ 43%). On the other hand, as seen from the CME speed vs.
reconnection ﬂux fraction plot in Figure 8, there are many events that are eruptive and yet have the reconnection ﬂux fraction
below the instability criterion, RΦ,inst ≈ 30%. A systematic analysis of these outlier events would be interesting to understand
why these events are eruptive.

Compared to eruptive events, we ﬁnd that conﬁned events tend to have stronger PIL ﬂuxes. We speculate that for a constant
amount of ﬂux in the ﬂux rope, stronger vertical PIL ﬂux implies weaker horizontal ﬂux and as a result smaller magnetic energy
within a ﬂux rope.

We also compare PIL shear (and a related ribbon net current) for conﬁned vs. eruptive events and ﬁnd that conﬁned events
have smaller PIL-shear and ribbon net current. This result statistically conﬁrms earlier studies of Liu et al. (2017) (4 events),
Avallone & Sun (2020) (30 events) and Kontogiannis et al. (2019) (32 events) who found that ﬂare-active/CME-active ARs are
associated with larger net currents than ﬂare-quiet/CME-quiet ARs. For our limited dataset, however, this relationship is not very
strong with large number of outliers, i.e. there are many eruptive events with small net current, as has been previously noted by
Avallone & Sun (2020). Case studies of these events might be useful to understand the relationship between eruptivity and the
net current. From the physics standpoint, we explain the lack of shear in conﬁned events by a smaller non-potential energy and
hence a smaller likelihood to erupt.

We note that all our conclusions regarding conﬁned vs. eruptive events are limited by a small number of conﬁned events that
we analyzed (7 events). Extension of this work to a larger sample of conﬁned and eruptive events would be necessary to draw
more conﬁdent conclusions.

In this paper we analyzed the pre-ﬂare vector magnetic ﬁelds within AR, ﬂare ribbons and PIL areas in 40 events and ARMS
eruption simulation with an objective of improving our understanding of the physical properties of ﬂaring vs. non-ﬂaring photo-
spheric vector magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere.

Our quantitative ﬁndings are as follows:

7. CONCLUSIONS

• Ribbon vs. PIL morphology: Qualitatively, comparing the near-PIL areas and ﬂare ribbons in observations and simulations
(Figures 2 and 10), we ﬁnd that the morphology of PILs has almost no bearing on the morphology of ﬂare ribbons. Hence,
while one can accept Schrijver (2007) contention that larger amounts of near-PIL ﬂux indicate a greater likelihood of a
larger ﬂare, the spatial arrangement of the PIL does not substantively constrain ribbons’ spatial distribution.

• Magnetic ﬂuxes: We ﬁnd strong statistical correlations between the ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux and the ﬂare ribbon and PIL
ﬂuxes (Figure 6a): Spearman correlation coefﬁcient rs(IX,peak, Φribbon) = 0.9 and rs(IX,peak, ΦPIL) = 0.6, respectively
in agreement with Kazachenko et al. (2017) analysis. While correlation between ﬂare size and PIL ﬂux is in line with
Schrijver (2007) hypothesis that ﬂare-productive ARs tend to have stronger PILs, it could reﬂect the fact that larger ARs
have stronger PILs and hence host larger ﬂares. The correlation between the peak X-ray ﬂux and the corresponding AR
quantities is weaker, ranging from rs(IX,peak, ΦAR) = 0.3 for full dataset (n = 3137, RibbonDB, Kazachenko et al.
2017) to rs(IX,peak, ΦAR) = 0.6 for FlareMagDB (n = 40).

• Reconnection ﬂux fractions: We ﬁnd moderate correlation between the ﬂare peak X-ray ﬂux and the fraction of AR mag-

netic ﬂux participating in the ﬂare, consistent with earlier results (Figure 6b).

• Mean magnetic shears: In both observations and simulations we ﬁnd that the mean magnetic shear is strongest within
PIL areas, decreasing gradually within ribbon and AR areas (Figure 6c): α(AR, rbn, P IL) = [10, 18, 26] × 103G · deg
for RibbonDB vs. α(AR, rbn, P IL) = [0.06, 0.13, 0.17] × 103G · deg for ARMS. The peak X-ray ﬂux is moderately
correlated with the mean magnetic shear within the AR and is weakly correlated with the mean magnetic shear within
ribbon and PIL areas.

• Current density morphology: Qualitatively, current density maps consist of thread-like and patchy structures that do not

exhibit any regular shape and do not correlate with ribbon locations, ﬂare and/or CME occurrence (Figure 12).

20

KAZACHENKO ET AL.

• Total vertical currents: We ﬁnd that the total area-integrated unsigned vertical current is largest within AR areas decreasing

gradually within ribbon and PIL areas (Figure 6d).

• Net currents: Over entire active region, we ﬁnd that currents are neutralized, in agreement with earlier studies (orange

symbols in Figure 7a):

(DC/RC)AR = 0.

Over one polarity (positive or negative) currents are non-neutralized (blue symbols in Figure 7a):

(DC/RC)AR,+ ≈ −(DC/RC)AR,− (cid:54)= 0.

(18)

(19)

The central part of the active region around the PIL has the highest net current decreasing gradually within ribbon and AR
areas (see red, green and blue symbols, Figure 7a). We ﬁnd that the net current within ﬂare ribbons strongly correlates with
the mean magnetic shear within the PIL (Figure 7b, rs = 0.7) with the scaling relationship |DC/RC| ∝ 0.02¯αPIL + 0.9,
implying that current non-neutralization is a manifestation of the shear accumulation along the PIL in agreement with
simulations (T¨or¨ok et al. 2014; Dalmasse et al. 2015).

• Conﬁned vs. eruptive ﬂares: We ﬁnd that for a given peak X-ray ﬂux, conﬁned events have larger PIL ﬂuxes and lower
mean PIL shears and ribbon net currents than eruptive events (see (cid:52) vs. • in Figures 6a, c and d), in agreement with Liu
et al. 2017; Avallone & Sun 2020. We also ﬁnd that the CME speed has a strong correlation with the fraction of the AR
that participates in the ﬂare (Figure 8). In fact the ﬂux ratio is the only variable that has a correlation coefﬁcient with the
CME speed above rs > 0.4.

To summarize, following Welsch et al. 2009 “intensive-extensive” classiﬁcation, our analysis suggests that while ﬂare peak
X-ray ﬂuxes are guided by extensive magnetic ﬁeld properties that scale with the AR size (like the total amount of magnetic ﬂux
that participates in the reconnection process, Bobra & Couvidat 2015), the CME speeds are guided by intensive properties that do
not scale with the AR size (like the fraction between the reconnection ﬂux and the AR ﬂux, deﬁned by the amount of overlying
ﬁeld, Bobra & Ilonidis 2016; Sun et al. 2015) with little dependence on the amount of mean PIL shear or net current.

This study is the largest-yet statistical analysis of the ﬂare vector magnetic ﬁelds within ﬂare-ribbon and PIL areas and the
relationship with other ﬂare and AR properties. Such a statistical approach is useful since it allows us to discover general laws
that may be overlooked by individual case studies.

The FlareMagDB catalog is available online2 in CSV and IDL sav ﬁle formats, along with maps of vector magnetic ﬁelds,
magnetic shear, current densities, PIL and ribbon masks, and can be used for different types of quantitative studies in the future,
from constraining the properties of the simulations to further detailed observation studies. For example, a comparison of magnetic
ﬁeld properties with presence of sigmoidal structures or ﬁlaments would be valuable to clarify the relationship between the
coronal structures and the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds. Analysis of the outliers in the derived trends, for example, events with
large magnetic shear and small net current and vice versa, would be interesting. Extension of this statistical work to a larger
number of conﬁned ﬂares observed over a decade of SDO, including temporal evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld properties over the
ﬂare (e.g. Sharykin et al. 2020; Barczynski et al. 2020), would allow us to further advance our understanding of solar eruption
magnetism.
