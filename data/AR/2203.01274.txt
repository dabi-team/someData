ABSTRACT

Long observational series for bipolar active regions (ARs) provide signiÔ¨Åcant information about the mutual transformation of
the poloidal and toroidal components of the global solar magnetic Ô¨Åeld. The direction of the toroidal Ô¨Åeld determines the polarity
of leading sunspots in ARs in accordance with the Hale‚Äôs polarity law. The vast majority of bipolar ARs obey this regularity,
whereas a few percent of ARs have the opposite sense of polarity (anti-Hale ARs). However, the study of these ARs is hampered
by their poor statistics. The data for Ô¨Åve 11-year cycles (16‚Äì18 and 23,24) were combined here to compile a synthetic cycle of
unique time length and latitudinal width. The synthetic cycle comprises data for 14838 ARs and 367 of them are the anti-Hale
ARs. A speciÔ¨Åc routine to compile the synthetic cycle was demonstrated. We found that, in general, anti-Hale ARs follow the
solar cycle and are spread throughout the time-latitude diagram evenly, which implies their fundamental connection with the
global dynamo mechanism and the toroidal Ô¨Çux system. The increase in their number and percentage occurs in the second part
of the cycle, which is in favour of their contribution to the polar Ô¨Åeld reversal. The excess in the anti-Hale ARs percentage at the
edges of the butterÔ¨Çy diagram and near an oncoming solar minimum (where the toroidal Ô¨Åeld weakens) might be associated with
strengthening of the inÔ¨Çuence of turbulent convection and magnetic Ô¨Åeld Ô¨Çuctuations on the arising Ô¨Çux tubes. The evidence of
the misalignment between the magnetic and heliographic equators is also found.

1 INTRODUCTION

Solar activity is widely associated with the mutual transformation of
the poloidal and toroidal components of the global magnetic Ô¨Åeld
during each solar cycle (SC). However, many essential details of this
mechanism are far from being understood quantitatively and quali-
tatively. The transformation is hidden in the depths of the convective
zone near the tachocline and is inaccessible for direct observations.
Despite the success in helioseismology, photospheric observations
remain the dominant source of information about the processes tak-
ing place in the solar interior. In particular, long observational series
spanning for more than a century exist for sunspot groups.

In every SC, it is the direction of the toroidal Ô¨Åeld that determines
the features of active regions (ARs) in the N- and S-hemispheres of
the photosphere on the Sun. The most obvious characteristic of ARs
is the leading sunspot polarity. The Hale polarity law states that the
leading sunspots (leaders) in bipolar sunspot groups in the Northern
hemisphere during even/odd cycles have the same positive/negative
polarity, whereas the polarity of the leaders in the Southern hemi-
sphere show the opposite tendency (Hale et al. 1919). This key em-

pirical fact had been the motivation and underlies the magnetic cycle
models, starting from the pioneering ones by Parker (1955); Babcock
(1961); Leighton (1964). The vast majority of bipolar ARs satisfy
the established regularity, although a small part of them happen to
show the converse behavior which can be termed as the Anti-Hale
polarity law.

This was Ô¨Årst emphasized by Hale & Nicholson (1925) and
repeatedly conÔ¨Årmed in further studies (see e.g. Richardson
1948; Smith & Howard 1968; Vitinsky 1986; Wang & Sheeley
1989; Khlystova & SokoloÔ¨Ä 2009; McClintock et al.
2014;
Abramenko et al. 2018; Li 2018; Mu√±oz-Jaramillo et al. 2021). So
far, occurrence of reverse-polarity ARs has no generally accepted
interpretation. Note that not all ARs on the Sun display the bipolar
structure. Among others, there are many unipolar and multipolar
ARs where the Hale polarity law is not always applicable (see e.g.
Abramenko et al. 2018; Zhukova et al. 2020a; Abramenko 2021).
Anti-Hale ARs constitute only about 3% of total number of ARs.

Studies of ARs violating the Hale polarity law (anti-Hale
ARs) play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in deepening our understanding
about some essential aspects of solar activity in such as the
role of the turbulent component of dynamo on diÔ¨Äerent scales
(StenÔ¨Ço & Kosovichev 2012; SokoloÔ¨Ä et al. 2015), formation of
magnetic Ô¨Çux tubes (L√≥pez Fuentes et al. 2000, 2003; Nelson et al.
2013) and especially about
the intricasies involved with the

polar Ô¨Åeld reversals (Hazra et al. 2017; Karak & Miesch 2018;
Mordvinov & Kitchatinov 2019; Mordvinov et al. 2022). Also the
knowledge gained in such studies help us to predict the character-
istics of upcoming solar cycle which has a very important practi-
cal implication for the rapidly growing space and satellite industry
(Mouradian & Soru-Escaut 1993; Nagy et al. 2017, 2019).

A reverse-polarity orientation is often found in ARs with domi-
nating ùõø-conÔ¨Åguration of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld. Such ARs are known
for their high Ô¨Çaring productivity and initiation of strong geomag-
netic events and therefore emphasize their importance in the inÔ¨Çu-
ence of space weather (Smith & Howard 1968; Knizhnik et al. 2018;
Abramenko 2021; Kashapova et al. 2021).

Unfortunately, the study of such groups is hampered by their poor
statistics (Zhukova et al. 2020b), and this is an obstacle for conduct-
ing some essential tests (for instance, to analyse the time-latitude
distribution of anti-Hale groups in detail). Meanwhile, the famous
Maunder butterÔ¨Çy diagram is one of the main observational patterns
of solar activity (e.g. Hathaway 2015; Usoskin 2017).

The aim of this work is to clarify the features of the temporal
and time-latitude distribution of anti-Hale ARs and to Ô¨Ånd possible
relation to the mechanisms of solar magnetic Ô¨Åeld evolution. For this
purpose we oÔ¨Äer a new observational test based on the combination
of data of several solar cycles and compilation of a synthetic cycle.
This will allow us to improve the statistics of anti-Hale groups. The
synthetic cycle that consists of 14838 ARs of Ô¨Åve SCs (16‚Äì18 and
23,24), including 367 anti-Hale groups, is also used to clarify the
issue of mutual position of the magnetic and heliographic equators.

2 DATA

As a source of reverse-polarity bipolar groups(anti-Hale ARs)
of SCs 23 and 24, we used the Catalog of bipolar active re-
gions violating the Hale polarity law from 1989-2018 (BARVHL),
and its prolongation (2019-2020), which can be accessed at
http://sun.crao.ru/databases/catalog-anti-hale. The
veriÔ¨Åcation of ARs in this catalog was carried out in accordance
with the criteria for identifying the anti-Hale groups based on a thor-
ough study of complex ambiguous cases (Zhukova et al. 2020b). The
main criteria assume that an anti-Hale AR is a group with sunspots
(at least pores) of both polarities, which are linked with pronounced
magnetic connection veriÔ¨Åed by a presence of UV-loops. These cri-
teria were also applied in the present study when dealing with ARs
of the period from 1925 to 1958. The Summary of Mount Wilson
magnetic observations of sun-spots (SMWMO) is the source of the
information about reverse-polarity ARs for this time interval. The
Summary was published in the Publications of the Astronomical So-
ciety of the PaciÔ¨Åc. The SMWMO data are available in digital form
at http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1538-3873.

We also used the data from modern solar

instruments,
(Scherrer et al.
namely magnetic Ô¨Åeld data from SOHO/MDI
1995), SDO/HMI
(Scherrer et al. 1995) and EUV data from
SOHO/EIT (Moses et al. 1997), SDO/AIA (Lemen et al. 2012).
We relied on the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD)
at http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/DPD (Baranyi et al.
2016) and the Mount Wilson observatiory (MWO) drawings at
ftp://howard.astro.ucla.edu/pub/obs.

We also used the Royal Greenwich Observatory and United
States Air Force/National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration Solar Region Summary (USAF/NOAA SRS) at
http://solarcyclescience.com/activeregions.html to get

the data for all ARs that appeared on the solar disk from 1919 to
1959 and from 1989 to 2021.

3 SYNTHETIC CYCLE COMPILATION

To overcome statistical limitations discussed in Introduction and to
explore the time-latitude distribution of anti-Hale groups, we used
the idea of combining data from several cycles.

The averaged period of the Schwabe cycle is known to be close
to 11 years. Although the cycles diÔ¨Äer slightly in their duration and
amplitude, they have approximately the same shape. As it was men-
tioned by Hathaway (2015), ‚Äúan average cycle can be constructed by
stretching and contracting each cycle to the average length, normal-
izing each to the average amplitude‚Äù. Implementation of this idea for
cycles 1-23 is shown in Fig. 26 in Hathaway (2015).

Using their approach and taking into account the latitudinal posi-
tions of ARs, we developed the method of creating a synthetic cycle.
For this purpose, for several full cycles we needed information on
all ARs including anti-Hale groups, that emerged on the disk from
the beginning to the end of each cycle. Therefore, we used data for
those cycles where the information on anti-Hale ARs is available.
The elongated catalog BARVHL (1989-2020) provided us with data
on the cycles 23 and 24. The SMWMO data from 1925 to 1958
allowed us to add the information on cycles 16, 17, and 18. During
these cycles in the SMWMO bipolar ARs with reverse polarity are
marked, which allowed us to compile a special database of veriÔ¨Åed
anti-Hale ARs for this time interval.

All this allowed us to operate with the data for Ô¨Åve solar cycles.

3.1 Determination of a hosting cycle for each AR

Compiling a correct database for each individual cycle is a challenge.
A simple segregation of ARs by time is not suitable due to the
overlapping periods during each solar minimum when both low-
latitude ARs of the old cycle and high-latitude precursors of the
new cycle appear on the disk simultaneously. First of all, we have
to determine which cycle a given AR belongs to. This should be
performed for each AR.

To deÔ¨Åne the solar cycles‚Äô boundaries as accurately as possible, we
used the technique suggested by McClintock et al. (2014). According
to their approach, a boundary between adjacent cycles is a line with a
slope of 1/60 (during sixty days the latitude changes by one degree).
The point of intersection of this line with the equator was adopted so
that the high-latitude ARs of a new polarity must be located to the
right from this border line, as it is shown in Fig. 1.

3.2 Mutual adjustment of the time-latitude diagrams of the Ô¨Åve

cycles

Time-latitude diagrams of the cycles that are overplotted do not
coincide. The length and width of the butterÔ¨Çy wings are diÔ¨Äerent
for diÔ¨Äerent cycles, as it is shown in the top panel in Fig. 2 for SCs
23 and 17.

To achieve the matching of butterÔ¨Çy wings, we performed a linear
transformation in both time and latitude coordinates. The SC 23 was
taken as the basic one because the ARs in this cycle are distributed
over the largest area on the time-latitude diagram. The start point
for each cycle, T0 in Fig. 2, was adopted as the moment when their
ARs begin to emerge regularly (at least two or three ARs per month).
The equatorial line was accepted as the natural latitude divider and
marked as L0. The lines T1 and L1 bound the SC 23. While selecting

their location, we neglected single distant data points. In the similar
way, the lines T2 and L2 outline the SC 17. The ratios T1/T2 and
L1/L2 were used as the extension coeÔ¨Écients for the coordinates of
the ARs of SC 17. As a result of this procedure the butterÔ¨Çy wings
for the SC 23 and the SC 17 occupy approximately the same area on
the time-latitude diagram, see the bottom panel in Fig. 2. The same
routine was performed for the rest three cycles. The graphic results
are summed up in in Fig. 3, whereas the transformation coeÔ¨Écients
are shown in Table 1.

4 VARIATIONS OF ANTI-HALE ARS ALONG THE

SYNTHETIC CYCLE

Advantages of using the synthetic cycle is the enhanced statistics
of rare anti-Hale ARs and a possibility to study the population of
ARs during a solar minimum without contamination caused by the
high-latitude ARs belonging to the next cycle. A distribution of
all 14838 ARs along the years of the synthetic cycle is shown in
Fig. 4 (top panel) with a black curve inorder to give a better visual
presentation and the data were normalized by 30. In the same Ô¨Ågure,
the distribution of 367 anti-Hale ARs along the systhetic cycle is
shown (the violet line). The distribution of all ARs is rather smooth,
although the presence of two maxima (Ô¨Årst emphasized by Gnevyshev
1963, and observed in the most SCs) is quite distinguishable. A total
duration of the synthetic cycle is about thirteen years. Note that the

circles, ARs of the SC 17 are overplotted with unÔ¨Ålled red circles. The lines
T1 and L1 show the most reasonable Ô¨Åt for the SC 23, whereas the narrower
cycle 17 was bounded with lines T2 and L2. The ratios L1/L2 and T1/T2 were
used as coeÔ¨Écients for linear stretching of the date from SC 17 to match the
two cycles in latitude and time. Bottom - the overlap between cycle 23 and

period of the sporadic singular occurence of the earliest new-cycle
precusors is not displayed here.

Anti-Hale ARs (thin violet line) show overall correspondence with
the cycle and demonstrate a pronounced peak in the second maxi-
mum of the synthetic cycle. It is consistant with our previous results
(an increase of irregular ARs, including anti-Hale ones, was found
in the second maxima of SCs 23, 24 by Abramenko et al. 2018;
Zhukova et al. 2020a).

The anti-Hale ARs relative number shown in the bottom panel
in Fig. 4), on the contrary, is cycle-independent (with the exception
of the late declining phase of the cycle and solar minimum). The
percentage is about 2.5% during the cycle, and we approximated it
by the linear function with the coeÔ¨Écient 0.06. During the Ô¨Årst year
of the cycle, the fraction of anti-Hale ARs is negligible (about 1%).
During the late declining phase (years 11 ‚àí 13), the fraction of anti-
Hale groups seems to be growing. Unfortunately, the interval of this
growth is very short and error bars are large, and it is not possible to
make a reliable Ô¨Åt. The red curve in the bottom panel in Fig. 4 only
indicates the trend of an increase.

To simulate the adjunction of cycles, we combined two identical
synthetic cycles with diÔ¨Äerent overlap intervals. The doubled syn-

thetic cycle with an overlapping interval of two years is shown in
Fig. 5. We found a pronounced peak (about 5%) in the solar mini-
mum. The result for an overlapping interval of one year is similar.
Note that such overlapping intervals are consistent with an observed
period of simultaneous occurrence of ARs of the adjacent cycles.
However, with the three-year overlapping interval the peaks were not
observed.

This Ô¨Ånding is in accordance with previous observations for SCs
20-23 by McClintock et al. (2014) and SCs 15-17 by SokoloÔ¨Ä et al.
(2015), who reported an enhancement in the anti-Hale ARs percent-
age during the solar minima. Our thorough analysis of the original
data on each anti-Hale AR from the BARVHL catalog and SMWMO
data showed that the peaks in anti-Hale percentage occur immedi-
ately before or at the moment when new-cycle groups start to appear.
It is interesting that the vast majority of anti-Hale groups belongs to
old cycles during every minimum, and the precursors of each new
cycle are regular ARs following the Hale polarity law.

6 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The catalog BARVHL (1989‚Äì2020) and SMWMO data (1925‚Äì1958)
on veriÔ¨Åed anti-Hale ARs allowed us to jointly explore the data for
Ô¨Åve completed SCs (16‚Äì18, 23, 24) and thus to overcome the limita-
tions associated with poor statistics of anti-Hale ARs. We developed
a routine to compile a synthetic cycle that takes into account the time
and latitude positions of the ARs. We thus obtained the synthetic
cycle consisting of 14838 ARs, including 367 anti-Hale ARs. As a
result, we would like to draw the following conclusions.

(i) The synthetic cycle has a typical shape of a SCs with two
typical maxima. The anti-Hale ARs demonstrate overall correspon-
dence with the cycle that shows their intrinsic connection with the
global dynamo. Apparently, such ARs have the same origin rooted
in the coherent toroidal Ô¨Çux system in the convection zone as all
other ARs. This is consistent with generally accepted theoretical and
phenomenological concepts of the solar dynamo (the mean-Ô¨Åeld dy-
namo theory, the Babcock-Lieghton mechnism) and the results of
recent observations (Mu√±oz-Jaramillo et al. 2021). The presence of
the pronounced peak in the anti-Hale ARs number in the second
maximum might mean the involvement of other, besides the global
dynamo mechanism of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld generation. However, the
convective zone (where the global dynamo operates) is a highly non-
linear dissipative medium and the complexity of physical processes
occurring there hinder further clariÔ¨Åcation about the probable mech-
anisms.

(ii) The relative number of anti-Hale ARs in the synthetic cycle is
mostly cycle-independent, excluding the years of the solar minimum.
The peak in the anti-Hale ARs percentage in the minimum was
also found for the coupling of two identical synthetic cycles (we
performed such a coupling with overlapping interval of two years
to simulate an adjunction of cycles). This result repeats the pattern
reported for sequences of SCs 15-17, 20-24 by McClintock et al.
(2014); SokoloÔ¨Ä et al. (2015). McClintock et al. (2014) associated
this phenomenon with a possible misalignment of the magnetic and
heliographic equators, and this will be discussed below in more
detail. SokoloÔ¨Ä et al. (2015) suggested the increasing inÔ¨Çuence of
small-scale processes, which become noticeable when the eÔ¨Äect of
the global dynamo is weakening. Our results do not contradict their
hypothesis.

(iii) The time-latitude diagram for the synthetic cycle shows that
the anti-Hale ARs are spread nearly uniformly over the diagram. The
time-latitude distribution of the relative number of anti-Hale ARs
shows a number of features. A pronounced excess of reverse-polarity
groups is found near the equator. At the same time, near the oncoming
solar minimum, noticeable growth of the percentage is observed on
various latitudes. An excess in the fraction of anti-Hale ARs is also
found along the edges of the butterÔ¨Çy diagram. In addition, one can
notice a week tendency for large circles in Fig. 7 to appear more often
and closer to the equator as the cycle proceeds.
Most of the observed features occur at

the maximum and
during the declining phase of the cycle. This period is known
as the time of the polar Ô¨Åeld reversal and building the polar
Ô¨Åeld that seeds the new cycle. The increased number and per-
centage of anti-Hale ARs at
the role of
that
such groups in the recovering of the global poloidal Ô¨Åeld may
indeed be signiÔ¨Åcant (Hazra et al. 2017; Karak & Miesch 2018;
Mordvinov & Kitchatinov 2019; Mordvinov et al. 2022). The en-
chanced percentage of the anti-Hale ARs on the diagram is ob-
served when the toroidal magnetic Ô¨Åeld is weakend (the edges of
the time-latitude diagram and area near oncoming solar minimum).
This growth might be related to the presumably increased inÔ¨Çuence

5 TIME-LATITUDE DISTRIBUTION OF ARS IN THE

SYNTHETIC CYCLE

All ARs of the synthetic cycle are presented in Fig. 6 as a time-
latitude (butterÔ¨Çy) diagram as open black circles. The anti-Hale ARs
are overplotted with Ô¨Ålled violet circles. One can see that the anti-
Hale ARs are spread nearly uniformly over the diagram.

The time-latitude distribution of the relative number of anti-Hale
ARs is presented in Fig. 7. The entire space of the butterÔ¨Çy diagram
was binned into equal intervals in time (one year) and latitude (seven
degrees). The relative number of anti-Hale groups in each bin is
shown as Ô¨Ålled violet circles of the size, which was proportional
to the relative number. These data are overplotted over the general
diagram for all 14838 ARs as it is shown in Fig. 6.

As the cycle proceeds, large violet circles in Fig. 7 show a gen-
eral tendency to appear more frequently and closer to the equator.
Noticeable crowding on them is observed near the oncoming solar
minimum. A visible excess of anti-Hale ARs is also found at the
edges of the butterÔ¨Çy diagram.

of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld Ô¨Çuctuations, high nonlinearity and turbulence
at magnetic Ô¨Çux tubes of ARs that emerges through the convective
zone (L√≥pez Fuentes et al. 2003; Knizhnik et al. 2018; Abramenko
2021). Since a butterÔ¨Çy diagram is believed to be related with the
the ‚Äúdynamo wave‚Äù (Parker 1955; MoÔ¨Äatt 1978; Krause & R√§dler
1980), we could also associate an increase in the share of anti-Hale
ARs with some obstacles in a wave propagation.

It is also worth mentioning that the similar trends, as we found
for the relative number of anti-Hale ARs, were reported for helical
characteristics of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld. Zhang et al. (2010); Xu et al.
(2015) found an increase of the average current helicity and twist
at the edges of the butterÔ¨Çy diagram and near the equator in SCs
23 and 24. A possibility of the hemispheric rule reverse during the
declining phase of each cycle was shown by Miesch et al. (2016) in
their 3D MHD simulations of the convective dynamo. Although a
strong twisting of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld does not mean the formation
of an anti-Hale AR in itself, it generates the kink instability, which
contributes to the formation of such ARs (Knizhnik et al. 2018).

And Ô¨Ånally, some remarks about the mutual location of the mag-
netic and heliopraghic equators should be made. The importance of
the anti-Hale ARs location and orientation relative to the equator
was Ô¨Årst emphasized by Richardson (1948). Zolotova et al. (2009).
Basing on a forty-years-observation data set, it was estimated that
the shift between the equators is around 4¬∞. Besides, according to
Obridko et al. (2011), the magnetic equator may have a complex
shape. The authors took into acount the mutual position of axial and
magnetic dipoles. McClintock et al. (2014) suggested to explain the
increase in the anti-Hale groups percentage during a solar minimum
as a result of a shift between the equators. Indeed, an excess in the
fraction of anti-Hale ARs in the equatorial region that was found in
this study supports their hypothesis. However, as it was shown above,
the increase in the anti-Hale ARs relative number near the solar mu-
nimum occurs at various latitudes. In this regard, we suppose that
this increase may be due to more than a single reason apart from the
equators‚Äô misalignment.

We would like to note that in the present work our primary fo-
cus was on the behavior of time-latitude distribution of the anti-
Hale ARs and our approach can be further used for the investi-
gation of the physical properties of anti-Hale ARs themselves e.g.
Mu√±oz-Jaramillo et al. (2021).
