Abstract

The construction of a butt-end multicell matrix proportional counter (MMPC) is presented in the work.
Each cell is a butt-end proportional counter with a 5 mm cathode diameter and 0.8 mm circular anode
diameter. In the example of the 3 × 3 matrix, it is shown that the gas multiplication of the central cell
depends on the potentials at the anodes of the peripheral cells, the drift electrode, the forming rings, and the
surrounding metal parts of the structure. The amplitude characteristics were measured when the MMPC
was ﬁlled with mixtures of 96.3% Ar + 3.7% Xe and 90% Ar + 10% CH4 at pressures of 620 Torr and 62
Torr. The calibration was carried out with α-particles and γ-quanta from a 238Pu source. For photons with
energies of 7.5 keV, a resolution of 26% was obtained. It is shown that, based on MMPC, it is possible to
fabricate recording surfaces of arbitrary conﬁguration.

1. Introduction

Results of investigations of the two-dimensional Micro-Pixel Chamber (µ-PIC) made on double-sided printed-
circuit-board (PCB) technology and intended for registration of ionization signals in the gas drift chambers ware
published in a set of articles in the last years, for example [1, 2, 3]. The µ-PIC structure consists of a set of parallel
copper cathode strips located with a pitch of 400 µm on a polyimide substrate on the side of the drift volume. Holes
with a diameter of 50 µm are made in the centre of each cavity in the substrate. Copper free cavities with 400 µm
pitch are made along axis of each strip. Holes on the backside of the substrate are conﬁgured along the axis of the
400 µm pitch anode strips, which is orthogonal to the cathode ones. Holes are ﬁlled with electrodeposited copper.
Each core butt end in the center of the cathode strip cavities is an anode of a proportional counter. Such structure
allows one to reach a good enough spatial resolution (∼200 µm) and demonstrates a relatively low level of random
discharges signals when working at the gas-multiplication factor 5000.

Investigations have shown that µ-TPC could be used as part of drift time-projection chambers intended to register
three-dimensional images of tracks from Compton electrons, β- and α-particles, and recoil nuclei from neutron or
hypothetical dark matter particles scattering. In the latter case, the energy resolution becomes a critical parameter,
which aﬀects the accuracy of reconstructing the energy spectrum of recoil nuclei. In [2], for a recording plane with
dimensions of 10 × 10 cm2, a resolution of ∼ 30% was obtained at an energy of 5.9 keV. In [4], a resolution of 20%
was obtained for a recording plane with dimensions of 3 × 3 cm2.

It was assumed that the deterioration in resolution for the larger plane was due to the increased variability in
the shape of anode electrodes due to the imperfect technology of circuit boards. However, as the practice has shown,
an energy resolution does not improve with the technology improvement.

One can be assumed that there is another underestimated factor that can lead to a deterioration in resolution
with an increase in the size of the board. This factor may be the collective inﬂuence of the ﬁelds of neighbouring

anodes on the value of the gas gain of a particular anode. It is quite diﬃcult to investigate this issue within the
framework of the printed circuit board conﬁguration due to the rigid mechanical connection of the elements. It seems
optimal to carry out such a study on a matrix plane consisting of separate, independent cells.

Investigation of the ﬂowing open butt-end proportional counter working characteristics was done recently in the
Baksan Neutrino Observatory of the INR RAS. A circular butt-end of a medical needle with 0.8 mm diameter was
used as an anode. A blowing oﬀ was implemented through the inner needle channel. The counter was intended for a
registration of low energy electrons from the low-active tagged biological samples. The energy resolution of the 5.9
keV X-ray was found to be ∼34% for the 95% Ar + 5% Xe gas mixture at 620 Torr pressure.

The counter showed good operating stability characteristics for a set of the gas mixtures at the 62-620 Torr
pressures. The working characteristics reconditioned without consequences after a high voltage decreasing at a
time of an amplitude characteristics measurement if a discharge voltage was reached. The analysis of the potential
possibilities, manifested in the design of the counter, showed that such cells could be used to make a registration
plane for drift time-projection chamber.

2. Detector construction

A schematic view of the test matrix counter (TMC) cross-section is shown in Fig.1. The design of the counter
is assembled on three parallel mounting racks, passed through holes in a set of ﬂat copper rings (6 pieces) with an
outer diameter of 73 mm and a width of 8 mm. The rings are evenly distributed along the length of the racks with a
pitch of 10 mm and are isolated from each other and from the metal of the racks with ﬂuoroplastic insulators. The
upper end of the mounting racks in the ﬁgure is ﬁxed on a solid disk, which is a high-voltage electrode for creating
a drift ﬁeld. The lower end of the racks is ﬁxed on a solid mounting disk with an installed cage of matrix counters.

A set of butt-end counters placed in holes (d=5 mm) passed through the holder and looked as 3 × 3 matrix. A
thickness of a wall between adjacent cells is 1.0 mm. The cells are numbered as (1,2,3) - ﬁrst row, (4,5,6) - second
row and (7,8,9) - third row. The axis of the central cell (No.5 ) coincides with the axis of the detector. A cylindrical
Teﬂon insulator with a stainless steel tube of 0.4 mm inner and 0.7 mm outer diameters installed along the axis is
inserted into the holder hole to make a separate cell. A working butt end of the tube is grinded and electropolished
before set into the insulator. This end ﬂush with the holder plane and is the cell’s anode. The backside of the tube
is connected with a central electrode of a spark plug which is installed hermetically through a set-up body ﬂange.
Other set-up features are shown in Fig.1.

3. Detector’s working characteristics

A source of the 238Pu with 3.8×104 Bq activity was used for the detector’s amplitude characteristics investigation.
Energies of the source α-particles are equal to 5456 keV (28.3%) and 5499 keV (71.6%). The isotope is a source of the
conversion electrons with energies of 22.53 keV (10.80%), 26.31 keV (9.48%), 39.18 keV (5.68%), 43.48 keV(2.15%)
and characteristics X-ray quanta with energies of 13.60 keV (3.97%), 17.06 keV (5.57%) and 20.29 keV(1.28%) [6, 7].
Measurements were made primarily with the α-particles energy releases to simplify a search and identiﬁcation
of energy lines. For this, the open-source surface was used, visible through the window (d = 0.8 mm) made in the
center of the bottom of the cylindrical recess (h = 0.3 mm) of the high-voltage electrode, designed to accommodate
the source. An α-particle ﬂux through this window corresponds to the ∼240 Bq source activity. The axis of the
source and the central cell coincide. Measurements were made for the (I ) 96.3% Ar + 3.7% Xe and (II ) 90% Ar
+ 10% CH4 gas mixtures at the 620 and 62 Torr pressures. A pressure 620 Torr is normal for the BNO INR RAS
location height. Pulses were taken by a charge sensitive preampliﬁer (CSA) and recorded by a digital oscilloscope
(DO).

gas mixture I (96.3% Ar + 3.7% Xe) at a pressure and drift voltage: (a) - [P = 620 Torr, Vd=-1500 V]; (b) - [P=62 torr,
Vd=-200 V]; star symbols are GMF values calculated from comparing the energies and amplitudes of impulses from photons

(d) - [P=62 torr, Vd=-200 V].

Figure 2 shows the voltage dependence of the gas gain factor (GMF) of cell No. 5(central) for the gas mixture
(I ) at two diﬀerent pressures. The dependence of a GMF on a high voltage value (Va) at a pressures of 620 Torr is
shown in Fig.2(a). A voltage (-1500 V) is ﬁded on the drift electrode (Vd). The anodes of the remaining cells are
grounded. The kink in the characteristic at voltages above ∼800 V is associated with an output voltage limitation
of the used CSA.

are grounded; spectrum 2 - voltage 370 V fed at all anodes; spectrum 3 - all cells integrated into the single counter by parallel
connection.

Figure 3(a) shows the amplitude spectra from cell No.5 at operating voltage Ua=700 V and drift voltage (-1500
V): spectrum 1 - surrounding anodes are grounded; spectrum 2 - at the surrounding anodes 700 V. Spectrum 3 was
obtained with the parallel combination of all cells into one counter.

The range of an α-particle with the 5.5 MeV in the gas mixture (I ) at 620 Torr is equal to 5.7 cm according to
calculations made by using the data from [9]. The range goes entirely in the counter working volume. A spectrum
shape will reﬂect a distribution of energy release projections to the registration plane transformed accordant to a
value of the cell gas gain and its uniformity around the anode circle. A peak with a double top is presented in
spectrum 3 at the maximal energy release. A view of the peak could reﬂect the distribution of the GMF in the cells
around the central one. All perimeter cells will have a GMF larger than the central one. Moreover, the corner cells
will have a GMF larger than the side ones. Since the structure under study does not have a screening grid, the drift
electrode’s potential should aﬀect the cells’ GMF. Energy release spectra of the cell No.5 were measured at Va=750
V for two values of Vd to estimate this inﬂuence. All other cells were grounded. Measured results are shown in
Fig.3(b). Spectrum 1 was measured for Vd=-1500 V, and spectrum 2 was measured for Vd=-200 V. It is seen that
increasing of the Vd at 1300 V decreases GMF at ∼11%. A peak at the maximal energy releases is seen in spectrum
2. Its appearance could be explained by increasing the eﬀective area of primary ionisation electrons collection to the
anode under the action of the own electric potential due to decreasing drift electric ﬁeld and increasing electron drift
time. The number of α-events with a total energy release will increase too.

The TMC response on low energy radiation was obtained by using the 238Pu source covered with the 50 µm Ni-foil.
The residual source X-rays and nickel characteristic photons (7.5 keV) excited by the source α-particles, electrons
and X-rays are coming from the foil surface. The spectra obtained at Va=987 V and Vd=-1500 V (spectrum 1 ),
Vd=-200 V (spectrum 2 ) are shown in Fig.3(c). The 7.5 keV (∼36 bin) and ∼17 keV (66 bin) lines are visible on
the spectra. An energy resolution of the 7.5 keV line on spectrum 1 is ∼26%.

The resolution is worsening with the drift ﬁeld growth because the working point of the cell drifted deeper to the
limited proportionality region. Such a conclusion could be made because a 7.5 keV peak appears in the ∼103 bin at
Va= 1025 V and Vd=-200 V, but 17 keV is in 138 bin only. The peaks have ﬂowed together at Vd=-1500 V, and
their common top is at ∼134 bin. A 7.5 keV line (A7.5) value was used to plot the GMF dependence in the region of
extremely acceptable working voltages. The GMF values were calculated from comparing energies and amplitudes
of the α-particles and photons pulses by formula GMF7.5 = A7.5/A5499) × (5499/7.5)× GMF5499. Obtained values

are plotted in Fig.2(a) by star points. The two parts of the dependence are connected with a straight dashed line.

The matrix counter potentially could be used in the dark matter search experiments where energy and spatial
characteristics of the nuclear recoil tracks are recorded simultaneously as in the experiment with using a low-pressure
gaseous time projection chamber (NEWAGE-0.3b) [5]. In this case, the measurements should be carried out at low
pressure to obtain a suﬃciently extended trajectory.

To obtain information on the parameters of the MMPC performance, we carried out test measurements at a gas
pressure of 62 Torr. The measurements were made at the 62 Torr gas pressure to get information about working
characteristics possible parameters. The GMF dependence on the high voltage for the cell No.5 ﬁlled up to 62 Torr
with the mixture (I ) is shown in Fig.2(b). A potential of the drift electrode is Vd=-200 V. All other anodes were
grounded to get this curve. Figure 3(d ) shows the amplitude spectra from cell No. 5 at anode voltage Ua=370 V
and a drift voltage Ud=-200 V: spectrum 1 was measured when all surrounding anodes were grounded; spectrum 2
was measured when at the surrounding anodes 370 V. Spectrum 3 was obtained with the parallel combination of
all cells into one counter. The 5.5 MeV α-particle range in the counter working gas is 57 cm. An energy release at
a distance of 7.8 cm between the drift electrodes and the registration plane is 752 keV if the energy losses assume
uniform along a track. The peak at the end of spectrum 3 corresponds to this energy release.

The gas mixture (I ) regards the non-metastable Penning mixture [8]. A reduced working voltage is observed for
this mixture compared to the usual (Ar+CH4)-mixture to reach the identical GMF. Reducing the operating voltage
can be helpful to increase the detector’s reliability with small gaps between the working electrodes. Measurements
with the gas mixture (II ) were made to specify a value of an expected gain. The 5.5 MeV α-particles ranges are
similar in both mixtures.

The GMF dependence on the high voltage for the cell No.5 ﬁlled up to 620 Torr with the mixture (II ) is shown
in Fig.2(c). A potential of the drift electrode is Vd = −1500 V. All other anodes were grounded to get this curve.
Amplitude spectra from the cell No.5 for the Va=1250 V and Vd=-1500 V are shown in Fig.4(a) where spectrum 1
was measured when all surrounding anodes were grounded, the spectrum 2 was measured when the voltage 1250 V
was fed at all anodes. Spectrum 3 was obtained when all cells were integrated into the single counter by a parallel
connection.

It is seen from a comparison of the GMF dependences for the gas mixtures (I ) and (II ) at 620 Torr that GMF=100
value obtained at Va=790 V and Va=1200 V correspondingly. The same GMF value for the 62 Torr was obtained
at Va=370 V and Va=510 V. A voltage gain for the gas mixture (I ) is signiﬁcant. It is seen from a comparison of
the GMF dependences for the gas mixtures (I ) and (II ) at 620 Torr that GMF=100 value obtained at Va=790V
and Va=1200 V correspondingly. The same GMF value for the 62 Torr was obtained at Va=370 V and Va=510 V.
A voltage gain for the gas mixture (I ) is signiﬁcant.

It is seen from Fig.3(a) that a supply of the Va=700 V on the before grounded cells around the cell No.5 decreases

an amplitude at ∼29%. It corresponds to decreasing of a voltage at the cell No.5 up to ∼675V.

A GMF on the peripheral cells should be larger than on the cell No.5 because of the absence of other anodes
with high voltage potential outside the matrix. This fact should be taken into account as an explanation of the
behavior of the α-peak shape and position. One can expect that the GMF of a cell in a larger dimension matrix
should decrease from the maximum up to any constant value when a cell position shifts from a periphery to the
center. A distribution of GMF values among cells could be more complicated in a region of a drift ﬁeld forming
electrodes potentials inﬂuence.

The ﬁeld strength determines the gas multiplication coeﬃcient of an individual cell of the TMC at the outer
edge of the annular end of the anode tube. This tension is a superposition of the tensions created by the potentials
of all metal parts surrounding the selected cell. In this case, the negative potentials of the drift electrode, forming
rings, and grounded parts increase the strength of the electric ﬁeld, while the positive potentials of the anodes of
the surrounding cells decrease it. The magnitude of the tension can vary along the circumference depending on the
total tension created by the unevenly distributed surrounding potentials. This nonuniformity has little eﬀect on
the averaged GMF of the cell at the used working gas pressure, judging by the resolution at 7.5 keV. Preliminary
measured or calculated correction could be made to decrease the inﬂuence of separate cells GMF values diﬀerences
to an energy resolution of an integrated spectrum.

Using a tube anode instead of a solid cylindrical end gives a voltage gain to achieve the same values of the GMF.
A modelling calculation shows that the maximal value of ﬁeld strength at the outside edge of an anode tube butt-end
will be at ∼12% larger than the one of a bar anode. This diﬀerence gives the sought for voltage gain to obtain similar
GMF values for the tube anode and the bar one.

Additional measurements of GMF were made with an anode butt-end dipped at 0.5 mm below (position 1) the
operational level (position 2) of the anode in the copper platform surface plane. The one lifted at 0.5 mm above
(position 3) the level (position 2) to estimate an inﬂuence of the butt-end installation accuracy along a cell axis on
the counter characteristics. The measurements were carried out on mixture (I ) at a pressure of 620 Torr, Va=800
and Vd=−1800 V. In case (1), the GMF decreased to a value of 0.632 of the GMF value for option (2), which is
equivalent to a decrease in the operating voltage at point (position 2) to 754 V or by 5.7%. In case (3), the GMF
also decreased to 0.936, equivalent to a decrease in the voltage at point (position 2) by 1.1%.

The variation coeﬃcients (k) for the examined particular case will be equal to kd = 0.736 mm−1 for a dipping
and ke = 0.128 mm−1 for an extending if one assumes that a GMF value varies arcwize with the speciﬁed position
deviations. The adduced data allow one to estimate an inﬂuence of a possible deviation of the butt-end plane from
the normal one on GMF value distribution around the anode ring. One point of the anode ring will be in the platform
surface plane (position 2), but the diametrically opposite point will be in the (position 1) at the “h” depth if the
anode plane is not a normal tube axis. A relative GMF value (M ) will vary from M2 = 1 in the (position 2) up to
M1 = M2 × (1 − h × kd) = 0.963 in the (position 1) if one take h=0.05 mm. GMF value deviation could impair
the energy resolution of the detected energy releases. One should keep the requirement of an anode butt-end plane
perpendicularity to the tube axis during the anode preparation to exclude this factor.

5. Conclusion

The results presented in this paper show that a cell consisting of a 0.7 mm medical needle tube inserted into the
centreline of a Teﬂon dielectric moulded in a 5 mm cylinder tube on a copper plate may be used as a gas proportional
counter. The tube ring butt-end is an anode. An energy resolution of ∼26% at 7.5 keV was obtained for the 96.3%
Ar + 3.7% Xe gas mixture at the 620 Torr pressure. A multicell counter in the form of an arbitrary size matrix
could be made on a base of such cells. It is shown on the 3 × 3 matrix sample that a gas multiplication coeﬃcient
of the central cell depends on electric ﬁeld potentials presented at peripheral cells, drift and ﬁeld-shaping electrodes,
and surrounding metallic parts of the counter construction. The GMF values diﬀer from the constant at diﬀerent
matrix sections due to this reason. This diﬀerence could be eliminated in the process of a summation of signals from
diﬀerent cells using the compensating coeﬃcients. A condition of an anode butt-end plane perpendicularity to the
tube axis during the anode preparation should keep preventing an inﬂuence of an anode butt-end geometry to the
counter energy resolution. The simplicity of separate cell preparation and absence of any technical limitations of the
counter registration surface shape allows one, in principle, to construct a multicell sensitive surface in the form of the
sphere. Such construction could represent an interest as a central electrode of the spherical proportional chamber
[10] since it allows to obtain a space angular sensitivity in the registered signals analysis.

The work is carried out in accordance with the INR RAS research plan.
