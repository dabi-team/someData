We address the problem of ﬁnding static and spherically symmetric anisotropic compact stars
in general relativity that admit conformal motions. The study is framed in the language of f (R)
gravity theory in order to expose opportunity for further study in the more general theory. Exact
solutions of compact stars are found under the assumption that spherically symmetric spacetimes
which admits conformal motion with matter distribution anisotropic in nature. In this work, two
cases have been studied for the existence of such solutions: ﬁrst, we consider the model given by
f(R) = R and then f(R) = aR+b. Finally, speciﬁc characteristics and physical properties have been
explored by analytically along with graphical representations for conformally symmetric compact
stars in f(R) gravity.

INTRODUCTION:

From the time of Sir Isaac Newton our understanding
of the nature of gravity has advanced but mysteries in
physics still remain. The process is still continuing af-
ter the ﬁrst formulation of Einsteins theory of General
Relativity (GR) [1], which is one of the most success-
ful fundamental theories of gravity in modern physics.
Despite its success, many extensions of the original Ein-
stein equations have been investigated to accommodate
present observational data on both astrophysical and cos-
mological scales. Observational data has conﬁrmed that
the Universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated ex-
pansion. Direct support is provided by the high preci-
sion data from Type Ia supernovae [2], the Cosmic Mi-
crowave Background (CMB) anisotropies [3], baryonic
acoustic oscillations [4] and from gravitational lensing
[5].
In particular, within the context of General Rela-
tivity, the observed cosmic acceleration of the Universe
cannot be explained without resorting to additional ex-
otic matter components (such as Dark Energy (DE) or
dark mater (DM)). Until now, no consistent model of
dark energy has been proposed which can yield a con-

vincing self-consistent picture of the observed Universe,
both in the ﬁeld of fundamental physics and in that of as-
trophysics. Currently experimental tests for DE and DM
are under design and it is believed that with precision
instrumentation such as the Square Kilometre Array ra-
dio telescopes such ideas will either be conﬁrmed or ruled
out. For this reason modiﬁcations of General Relativity
have been proposed and are currently receiving a great
deal of attention.

Alternative gravity theories generally appear to exhibit
good agreement between theory and observation. and the
introduction of additional geometrical degrees of freedom
may assist us in abandoning the concepts of DE or DM.
Many alternative theories have been proposed such as
f (R) gravity [20], scalar-tensor theories [7], braneworld
models [8], Gauss-Bonnet gravity [9], Galileon gravity
[10] have gained a lot of attention in recent years. Addi-
tionally Ellis [11, 12] revived an idea proposed by Wein-
berg [13], that of trace-free Einstein gravity, which has
also gone by the name unimodular [14, 15] gravity. In
this framework an attempt was made to rectify the dis-
crepancy in the value of the cosmological constant as pre-
dicted by quantum gravity in contrast with what is ac-
tually observed. Dadhich [16] has also presented strong
arguments for using the Lovelock polynomial terms as
the generator of the Lagrangian density. The remarkable
feature of the Lovelock theory is that while it is polyno-
mial in the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar,
it nevertheless results in at most second order equations

 
 
 
 
 
 
of motion. Moreover, the zeroth case corresponds to the
cosmological constant while the linear case yields the fa-
miliar Einstein gravity theory. The eﬀects of the higher
curvature terms are only felt in dimensions greater than
4 so that the theory is a natural generalisation of GR
to higher dimensions. Investigations into higher dimen-
sional gravity is strongly motivated by string theoretic
ideas which are supposed to be compatible with grav-
ity theories. It should be mentioned here that many of
these modiﬁcations have provided a number of signiﬁcant
results in cosmology [18, 19] as well as astrophysics [20].
In the present article we have endeavoured to frame
the core problem in the language and formalism of the
f(R) theory although the speciﬁc cases under considera-
tion reduce to the standard Einstein theory which con-
tains an action principle that is linear in the Ricci scalar.
The reason for this choice of formalism is that it opens
the way for further investigations of more general func-
tional forms of the Ricci scalar such as the Starobinksy
model in subsequent work. In f(R) gravity theories the
Einstein-Hilbert action is generalized with a function of
the Ricci scalar R, (see the reviews [24, 26]) have also
been extensively analyzed recently. Earlier interest in
f(R) theories occurred in connection with the early Uni-
verse [24], and a number of viable f(R) models have pro-
posed that satisfy the observable constraints - see e.g.,
Refs. [25]. It is noted that f(R) theory was contemplated
long ago by Buchdahl [26] who introduced f(R) gravity
using non-linear Lagrangians. One of the main reasons
for increased interest in f(R) gravity was motivated by
inﬂationary scenarios, in the Starobinsky model, where
f(R) = R-Λ+αR2 gravity are considered in [27]. The
Cosmology of generalized modiﬁed gravity models have
been studied by Carroll et al [28]. In this context, many
authors have demonstrated interest by exploring some of
their interesting properties and characteristics, such as:
structure formation and stability conditions of neutron
stars, which was studied by [44, 46] and the gravitational
collapse of spherically symmetric perfect ﬂuids by [45].

Apart from the cosmological solutions, gravitational
theories must be tested also in the astrophysical Level
to get a more realistic picture of the gravitational ﬁelds.
In this sense, strong gravitational regimes found in rela-
tivistic stars could discriminate General Relativity from
its generalizations [29]. However, it should be remem-
bered that present day astronomical observational data
suggests that neutron stars can be used to investigate
possible deviations from GR and act as probes for any
modiﬁed gravity model. These ideas will recent added
impetus in the coming decade when the Square Kilome-
tre Array experiment is fully functional. At the same
time, the structure of compact stars in perturbative f(R)
gravity has been studied in [30]. Another class of interest-
ing models on hydrostatic equilibrium of stellar structure
that have been investigated in the framework of f(R)-
gravity by [31]. The primary motivation for ﬁnding ex-
act interior solutions to Einsteins Field equations in f(R)
gravity for their static and spherically symmetric case is

2

that they can be used to model physically relevant com-
pact objects. With the estimate values for masses and
radii from diﬀerent compact objects, the recent observa-
tional prediction fails to be compatible with the standard
neutron star models because densities of nuclear matter
is much lower than the densities of such compact objects.
This situation can theoretically be explained by the exis-
tence of two diﬀerent kinds of interior pressures namely,
radial and transverse pressure. In this regard, the study
of models of anisotropic stellar distributions has received
great interest in GR as well in modiﬁed theories of grav-
It is required of such models that elementary re-
ity.
quirements are met in order to be physically viable. For
example, it is expected that the energy conditions are sat-
isﬁed, the interior and exterior spacetimes are smoothly
matched across a suitable hypersurface and that causal-
ity is not violated. Having these in mind, the motivation
is to study models of the anisotropic compact stars in the
framework of f(R) gravity by admitting non-static confor-
mal symmetry using the diagonal tetrad method. Indeed
the model considered here corresponds to the standard
Einstein theory in view of the choice of an action principle
that is linear in the Ricci scalar. The consequence is that
the equations of motion are the usual second order vari-
ety. If the more general Starobinksy model were selected
then the equations of motion would involve derivatives of
the order of four. This case will be pursued in another
study. At ﬁrst, Maartens and Maharaj [36] have studied
the static spherical distributions in charged imperfect ﬂu-
ids admitting conformal symmetry and now its become a
popular model to established a natural relationship be-
tween geometry and matter source, with the help of the
Einstein ﬁeld equations. In the same context Das et al.
[37], obtained a set of solutions describing the interior
of a compact star under f(R, T) gravity and Ray et al.
[38] have studied electromagnetic mass models for static
spherical distribution admitting CKV.

The study of anisotropic spherically symmetric distri-
butions have a long history. Such models are heavily
under-determined and admit a large number of solutions.
Bowers and Liang [39] presented a simple anisotropic
model with constant density. The mass implications in
anisotropic distributions were revisited by Baracco ıet
al [40] and it was shown that the well known Buchdahl
mass limit applicable to isotropic spheres may be vio-

anisotropic ﬂuids with spherical symmetry. Mathemati-
cal prescriptions such as conformal ﬂatness were studied
by Stewart [42] who postulated forms for the mass func-
tion to generate exact models. Nonstatic spheres admit-
ting a one parameter group of conformal motions were
studied by Herrera and Ponce de Leon [43] but without
specifying a linear equation of state.

Motivated by the above discussion, we study the com-
pact stars solutions with their interesting properties and
characteristics in the context of f(R) theory of gravity ad-
mitting initially non-static conformal symmetry and with
a speciﬁed equation of state. The paper is organized as

follows: in Section II, we review f(R) modiﬁed theories of
gravity whereas in Section III, the CKVs are formulated.
In Section IV, we formulate the system of gravitational
ﬁeld equations, then in Section V we describe the star in-
terior, using the spherically symmetric line element and
CKVs. In Section VI, we have discussed various physical
features of the model such as energy conditions, equi-
librium condition by using Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ
(TOV) equation and stability issue. Finally in Section
VII, we conclude with a summary and discussions.

II. BASIC MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
IN F(R) GRAVITY

Let us consider the following action in f(R) gravity of

the form

£ =

g[f (R) + Lm],

(1)

where g is the determinant of the space-time metric gµν
assuming that, 8πG = 1 and Lm is the matter La-
grangian. Here f(R) is a general function of the Ricci
scalar, R. Within the context of the metric formalism,
variation of the action Equation (1) with respect to gµν
generates the ﬁeld equations

represents the energy momen-
tum tensor of the matter scaled by a factor of 1/f ′(R)
and T (curv)
is an extra stress-energy tensor contribution

by the f(R) modiﬁed gravity theory and is given by

where ρ depicts energy density, pr is the radial pressure,
pt to be the tangential pressure, respectively. In the ex-
pression uα is the four-velocity of the ﬂuid and vα cor-
responds to the radial four vector. Note that with the
assumption of an anisotropic particle pressure, the ﬁeld
equations may be solved by an inﬁnite number of met-
rics. Additional restrictions based on physical grounds
must be introduced to model realistic objects. Custom-
arily an equation of state relating the pressure and the
density may be imposed, however, this approach runs
into sever mathematical problems making the equation
of pressure isotropy impractical to solve. In this work, we
elect to utilise a geometric prescription. New classes of
anisotropic star solutions admitting conformal motions
are sought and investigated.

III. CONFORMAL KILLING VECTOR

To establish a natural relationship between geometry
and matter through the Einsteins GR, and searching for
an exact solutions by convincing approach we use a non-
static conformal symmetry. Following the idea a work has
recently been considered in [32]. For instance, one may
specify the vector ξ as the generator of this conformal
symmetry, and the metric g is conformally mapped onto
itself along ξ so that the following relationship

ξgij = ψgij,

L

(5)

is obeyed. Here
represents the Lie derivative operator
of the metric tensor whereas ψ is the conformal killing
vector.

L

As for the choice of the vector ξ, generates the con-
formal symmetry within the framework of the standard
GR, then the metric g is conformally mapped onto itself
along ξ. According to B¨ohmer et al. [33], for the choice of
static metric, neither ξ nor ψ needs be static. It should
be noted that if ψ = 0 then Eq. (6) gives the Killing
vector, if ψ = constant then it yields a homothetic vec-
tor and if ψ = ψ(x, t) then it gives conformal vectors.
Furthermore, the spacetime becomes asymptotically ﬂat
when ψ = 0, which also implies that the Weyl tensor
will vanish. All such conformally ﬂat spacetimes have
been found. They are either the Schwarzschild interior
solution in the case of no expansion or the Stephani [34]
stars if expansion is occurring. Accumulated all of this
properties of CKV have been eﬀectively provide a deeper
insight Accumulated all of this properties of CKV have
eﬀectively provided a comprehensive picture of the un-
derlying spacetime geometry. Here Eq. (5) implies that

ξgik = ξi;k + ξk;i = ψgik,

L

(6)

with ξi = gikξk. From Eq. (4) and (7), the following
expressions [33] are obtained as

ξ1ν′ = ψ, ξ4 = const., ξ1 =

ψr

and ξ1λ′ + 2ξ1

,1 = ψ,

where 1 and 4 stand for spatial and temporal coordinates
r and t respectively. Then Eq. (6) provides the following

As a ﬁrst step in our analysis we consider solutions for
f(R)=R and f(R) = aR + b, where a and b are purely
constant quantities. Note that this prescriptions is es-
sentially the general relativity case without and with a
cosmological constant. We further assume that the stan-
dard matter for a ﬂuid distribution obeys the equation
of state

pr = ωρ

where the state parameter w is a constant and , 0 <
w < 1 for causality. That is the speed of sound remains

focus on several physically relevant f(R) gravity models
and seek interior solutions of the Einstein ﬁeld equations
with conformal Killing vector, that can model compact
objects. The ﬁeld equations of f(R) modiﬁed theories are
highly non-trivial to solve, so the entire calculations are
highly dependent on the equation ansatz. We choose to
solve the continuity equation for decoding the system of
equations for our purpose.

On account of the assumption of isotropic particle pres-
sure, we have not invoked the relationship p = ωρ so
as not to over-determine the system. However, the solu-
tion above does indeed exhibit an equation of state of the
form p = p(ρ) consistent with perfect ﬂuid distributions.
Observe that setting B = 0 gives the Saslaw et al.
[35]
isothermal ﬂuid model with both the energy density and
pressure obeying the inverse square law and obviously
the barotropic linear equation of state p = ωρ. That the
metric potential λ is not constant in this model may be
attributed to the presence of the conformal symmetry.

In ﬁgs. 1, 2, 4 and 6 we plot variation of all the en-
ergy conditions inside the compact objects for a given
w = 0.52 with diﬀerent values of constant parameters.
In the case of isotropic pressure when f(R) = R, plot-
ted in Fig. 2, it is evident that null energy conditions
(NEC) is satisﬁed but strong energy conditions (SEC) is
violated for our parametric choice however for other cases
the energy conditions are valid inside the compact star.

B. TOV Equation

The success of this model lies in its stability under
the diﬀerent forces namely gravitational, hydrostatic and
anisotropic forces. To examine these we consider the
generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equa-
tion for anisotropic ﬂuid distribution is given by [47]

Summarising, this expression is arranged in terms of

tion for the compact star, involving the gravitational, hy-
drostatic and anisotropic forces for stellar objects. This
equation can be expressed in the more compact form as

In order to illustrate this qualita-
tively, we use graphical representation for both cases
when f(R) = R and f(R) = aR+b, which are shown in
Figs. 3, 5 and 7 (right panel) by assigning the value of ω
= 0.58. In spite of this model we see that in every cases
Fh and Fa takes the negative value while Fg is positive.
As a result, it is clear that gravitational force is coun-
terbalanced by the combined eﬀect of hydrostatic and
anisotropic forces to hold the system in static equilib-
rium. Models to explain the static equilibrium in-depth
have been extensively studied by Rahaman et al.
[48]
and Rani & Jawad [49].

C. Stability Analysis

si ≤

We are interested in checking the sound speed, using
the concept of Herrera’s cracking (or overtuning) [50],
which lies within the range 0 < v2
1 i.e., according
to this procedure the radial and transverse velocity of
sound lies within the proposed range. We have shown
graphically the radial and transverse velocity of sound
for both cases when f(R) = R and f(R) = aR + b, which
are shown in Figs. 3, 5 and 7 (left panel) and observe that
these parameters satisfy the inequalities 0 < v2
1 and
0 < v2
1 everywhere within the stellar object except
the isotropic case when f(R) = R.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have studied analytical solutions for
compact stellar objects with a general static interior
source in the framework of f(R) gravity satisfying the
conformal Killing vectors equations. The investigation
has been performed for two speciﬁc cases when f(R) = R
and f(R) = aR + b; further the stars are assumed to be
anisotropic in their internal structure. In order to get ex-
act solutions we have considered a systematic approach
by assuming the spherical symmetry and interior of the

9

dense star admitting non-static conformal symmetry.

For a simplest form of the ﬂuid sphere, we have studied
the two speciﬁc arguments for both isotropic (pr = pt)
as well as non isotropic (pr
= pt) cases. Interestingly, we
have identiﬁed that among the two cases ( case 4.1 and
4.2 ), only the solution for isotropic condition pr = pt = p
when f(R) = R is not physically valid because the behav-
ior of diﬀerent energy conditions does not attribute the
regularity conditions at the interior of the star. Further-
more, it has been found that our solution satisﬁes all the
energy conditions and that pressures are positive and ﬁ-
nite throughout interior of the stars which are needed for
physically possible conﬁgurations have been discussed in
detail. For a stable conﬁguration, we have shown that
the generalized TOV equation which describes the equi-
librium condition for an anisotropic ﬂuid subject to by
the diﬀerent forces, viz. gravitational force (Fg), hydro-
static force (Fh) and anisotropic force (Fa) in Figs. 3, 5
and 7 (left panel). Another interesting result of this pa-
per is related with checking the stability of our model by
adapting Herrera’s cracking concept [50] and it has been
found that the radial and transverse speeds of sound lies
within the limit of (0, 1] which are shown in Figs. 3,
5 and 7 (reght panel). Hence we concluded that our so-
lution might have astrophysical relevance by this theory
through ﬁne tuning. Therefore, it would be an interest-
ing task to verify our solution with sample data for more
satisfactory features in the realm of physical reality which
will be our next venture in this line of study. Moreover,
we propose to consider more general functional forms of
f to go beyond the standard model of general relativity
as considered in this work.
