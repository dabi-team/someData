ABSTRACT
We analyze the X-ray spectra of 19 main sequence stars observed by Chandra using its LETGS con-
ﬁguration. Emission measure (EM) distributions are computed based on emission line measurements,
an analysis that also yields evaluations of coronal abundances. The use of newer atomic physics
data results in signiﬁcant changes compared to past published analyses. The stellar EM distributions
correlate with surface X-ray ﬂux (FX ) in a predictable way, regardless of spectral type. Thus, we
provide EM distributions as a function of FX , which can be used to estimate the EM distribution of
any main sequence star with a measured broadband X-ray luminosity. Comparisons are made with
solar EM distributions, both full-disk distributions and spatially resolved ones from active regions
(ARs), ﬂares, and the quiet Sun. For moderately active stars, the slopes and magnitudes of the EM
distributions are in excellent agreement with those of solar ARs for log T < 6.6, suggesting that such
stars have surfaces completely ﬁlled with solar-like ARs. A stellar surface covered with solar X-class
ﬂares yields a reasonable approximation for the EM distributions of the most active stars. Unlike
the EM distributions, coronal abundances are very spectral-type dependent, and we provide relations
with surface temperature for both relative and absolute abundances. Finally, the coronal abundances
of the exoplanet host star τ Boo A (F7 V) are anomalous, and we propose that this is due to the
presence of the exoplanet.

1. INTRODUCTION
Cool main sequence stars are universally observed to be surrounded by hot coronae (T = 106−7 K), which represent
the outermost atmospheric layers of such stars. The nature and origin of the surprisingly hot coronae has been a focal
point of solar/stellar atmosphere research for decades. Stellar coronae are best studied at short wavelengths, as most
emission from hot coronal material comes out in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. Most of what we
know about stellar coronae comes from soft X-ray observations from a series of spacecraft dating back to the 1970s
(G¨udel 2004; G¨udel & Naz´e 2009). This legacy continues today with the Chandra and XMM-Newton spacecraft, which
have both been observing the X-ray sky since 1999.

Only so much can be learned about coronae from simple broadband ﬂux measurements. More detailed study requires
high resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Both Chandra and XMM carry gratings that provide spectra of unprecedented
quality. The Reﬂection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) on XMM observe from 5 − 35 ˚A. Chandra carries two gratings,
the High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) and the Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG). The former is
generally paired with the ACIS-S detector to make the HETG Spectrometer (HETGS), which observes from 1.2−31 ˚A.
The latter is generally paired with the HRC-S detector to make the LETG Spectrometer (LETGS), observing from
5 − 175 ˚A. With its particularly broad wavelength range, Chandra/LETGS is capable of observing signiﬁcantly more
lines of more atomic species than either Chandra/HETGS or XMM/RGS. Thus, we will here be focusing on the analysis
of Chandra/LETGS data.

Analysis of emission lines observed in a coronal X-ray spectrum involves the reconstruction of the coronal emission
measure (EM) distribution. This process yields two crucial diagnostics. The ﬁrst is the EM distribution itself, which
describes the distribution of temperature in the corona, and the second involves the measurement of element abundances
in the corona, which can be diﬀerent from photospheric abundances. Both the temperature and abundance diagnostics
are crucial for studying the mechanism(s) behind coronal heating.

As for the abundance diagnostic, the solar corona and wind exhibit an abundance pattern where elements with low

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP) have abundances that are enhanced relative to elements with high FIP (von Steiger et al.
1995; Feldman & Laming 2000; Laming 2015). Similar “FIP eﬀects” have been observed for some stellar coronae
(Drake et al. 1997; Laming & Drake 1999), but in other cases coronal abundances appear to be close to photospheric
(Drake et al. 1995; Audard et al. 2001; Sanz-Forcada et al. 2009). Finally, there are a number of cases where an
“inverse FIP eﬀect” is observed, where low-FIP elements are depleted relative to high-FIP elements (G¨udel et al.
2001; Huenemoerder et al. 2001; Audard et al. 2003; Robrade & Schmitt 2005). On the Sun, an inverse FIP eﬀect has
recently been detected for the ﬁrst time near sunspots during ﬂares (Doschek et al. 2015).

Signiﬁcant eﬀort has been expended to study how coronal abundances vary with activity level and spectral type.
Initial attention focused on the connection between high activity and inverse FIP, as notoriously active M dwarfs and
active binaries tend to have inverse FIP (Liefke et al. 2008).
In a survey of early G dwarfs, Telleschi et al. (2005)
found inverse FIP or no FIP eﬀect for the youngest and most active stars with ages less than 300 Myr, but solar-like
FIP eﬀects at older ages. The importance of spectral type for coronal abundances becomes clear if attention is focused
only on main sequence stars, particularly if extremely active stars with X-ray luminosities (in ergs s−1) of log LX > 29
are ignored. For such stars, a surprisingly tight relation between FIP bias and spectral type is found, with M dwarfs
having an inverse FIP eﬀect, which reduces toward no FIP eﬀect at a mid-K spectral type, and then drifts toward
a solar-like FIP eﬀect for early G dwarfs (Wood & Linsky 2010; Wood et al. 2012). We will refer to this relation as
the “FIP-Bias/Spectral-Type” (FBST) relation. This relation implies that all M dwarfs have inverse FIP, not just the
very active ones. Thus, the vast majority of main sequence stars in the Galaxy (all but the most active) are presumed
to follow the FBST relation.

The element fractionation that occurs in the process of coronal heating is potentially a crucial diagnostic of this
heating, and any successful coronal heating model should be able to explain the fractionation patterns that are observed
on the Sun and other stars. Currently the only theoretical framework for explaining both a FIP eﬀect and an inverse
FIP eﬀect involves the presence of ponderomotive forces induced by Alfv´en waves passing through coronal loops, with
the direction of the force along the loop depending on where the waves are introduced and where they reﬂect within the
loops (Laming 2004, 2009, 2012; Wood & Laming 2013). If correct, this model would strongly support an important
role for Alfv´en waves (or their generation) in coronal heating.

Returning to the temperature diagnostic characterized by the EM distributions themselves, coronal temperature
is an even more direct diagnostic of coronal heating than the abundances, with higher temperatures implying more
intense heating. Observations clearly show that more active stars, with higher X-ray luminosities, systematically have
higher coronal temperatures, implying that increases in stellar activity are not simply a matter of ﬁlling the stellar
surface with more and more identical active regions (G¨udel 1997; Schmitt 1997; Telleschi et al. 2005). The most recent
empirical analysis is that of Johnstone & G¨udel (2015), who ﬁnd an impressively tight relation between mean coronal
temperature and X-ray surface ﬂux for cool main sequence stars of all types: Tcor = 0.11F 0.26
X , with Tcor in MK units
and FX in ergs cm−2 s−1.

Such analyses rely on reducing the coronal temperature distribution to just one or two temperatures. In reality,
however, coronal temperature distributions seem to be more or less continuous, as opposed to singly or doubly valued.
With nearly 20 years of data now acquired by Chandra and XMM, it should now be possible to use detailed EM
distributions to more precisely describe how coronal temperature changes with increasing activity, thereby providing
more detailed constraints for coronal heating models. For example, one interpretation of the increase in Tcor with
activity is that this is indicative of the increasing dominance of ﬂare-like emission as stellar activity increases. Another
interpretation is that it is indicative of the increasing prevalence of a population of hotter and presumably larger
coronal loops (e.g., G¨udel 2004; Reale 2014). A precise assessment of how the EM distribution evolves as activity
increases could be helpful for distinguishing between such interpretations, and this is a central goal of our project.

To accomplish this goal, we conduct a survey of all main sequence stars observed with Chandra/LETGS. We measure
EM distributions using uniform analysis procedures, and assuming consistent atomic data. We also measure coronal
abundances for our sample of stars, and study how they vary with activity and spectral type. This work overlaps
strongly with work already done on the FBST relation (see above), but we expand this in a number of important ways.
For example, the FBST relation deﬁned above involves measurements of relative coronal abundances, particularly
abundances of high-FIP elements relative to the best measured low-FIP element, Fe. However, we here also assess
whether absolute abundances, for Fe in particular, vary with spectral type like the relative abundances.

A ﬁnal motivation for this project is that our sample of Chandra/LETGS spectra includes two particularly noteworthy
recent observations obtained by us. One is an observation of η Lep (F1 V) in 2017 December, which is the earliest type
main sequence star successfully observed by Chandra with grating spectroscopy. This helps us to extend the FBST
relation to earlier spectral types, and test whether stars with very thin convection zones have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent

EM distributions. Also, in 2017 February-March Chandra/LETGS observed the exoplanet host star τ Boo A (F7 V).
This observation allows us to assess whether a very close-in, massive exoplanet can aﬀect coronal temperatures and
abundances in a way that makes the star clearly anomalous in our survey.

2. SAMPLE DEFINITION AND DATA REDUCTION

Our data sample is deﬁned by existing Chandra/LETGS spectra of main sequence stars deemed to be of suﬃcient
quality for our purposes. Table 1 lists the 19 targets with spectra that have numerous enough detectable emission
lines for an EM analysis to be performed. The targets are listed in order of spectral type, ranging from η Lep (F1 V)
to AD Leo (M4.5 Ve). The stars cover a wide range of activity levels, with X-ray luminosities (column 6 in Table 1)
ranging from log LX = 26.99 (in erg s−1) for α Cen A to log LX = 30.06 for EK Dra and AB Dor A. These X-ray
luminosities are for the canonical ROSAT PSPC soft X-ray bandpass of 0.1 − 2.4 keV (e.g., 5 − 120 ˚A), and are
measured directly from the LETGS spectra themselves.

The fourth column of Table 1 lists radii for our stars, which are necessary to compute X-ray surface ﬂuxes (FX ).
Recent work provides evidence in favor of FX being a preferable measure of stellar activity compared with LX or
LX/Lbol (Johnstone & G¨udel 2015; Booth et al. 2017). Our default source of radius estimation is the relation of
Barnes et al. (1978), but many radii are taken from more direct measurements (Kervella et al. 2003; Morin et al. 2008;
Gillaspy et al. 2011; Boyajian et al. 2012a,b). The ﬁfth column lists photospheric eﬀective temperatures (Tef f ). Most
of these are from published spectral analyses of the individual stars (Valenti & Fischer 2005; Holmberg et al. 2009;
Heiter et al. 2015). The remainder are estimated using the Tef f versus B − V relation of Valenti & Fischer (2005),
or for stars later than early-K taken from Table 5 in Pecaut & Mamajek (2013) or the Tef f versus V − K relation of
Mann et al. (2015).

Our measured coronal abundances will have to be compared with photospheric abundances, so Table 1 lists pho-
tospheric abundance measurements for our stars. Following the usual convention, the abundances are listed logarith-
mically relative to solar photospheric abundances, so a value of 0.0 corresponds to an abundance equal to that of

the solar photosphere. Throughout the paper our default solar photospheric reference abundances will be those of
Asplund et al. (2009). For three companion stars (36 Oph B, ξ Boo B, and 70 Oph B) we assume the companion has
the same abundances as the primary. No photospheric abundances are available for the two M dwarfs in the sample
(AU Mic and AD Leo), as the formation of molecules makes photospheric abundance measurements very diﬃcult.
We are forced to simply assume solar photospheric abundances for those stars. Likewise, photospheric abundance
measurements are also very diﬃcult for the two rapidly rotating stars EK Dra and AB Dor A, due to line blending
induced by rotational broadening. We once again simply assume solar abundances for those stars, consistent with
crude estimates from optical spectra (J¨arvinen et al. 2007; Vilhu et al. 1987). Finally, for 61 Cyg AB there are no
measurements for C and N, so we simply assume values identical to Fe.

Table 2 lists the individual Chandra/LETGS observations that we have to work with, and we now describe the data
reduction procedures used to process the data. Rather than use the default processed spectrum, we process the data
ourselves, using version 4.9 of the CIAO software provided by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC) (Fruscione et al. 2006).
Many of our targets are binary stars with two separate resolved sources, and a tailored data processing is necessary
in such cases anyway. An LETGS observation consists of a zeroth-order image of the target, with plus and minus
order X-ray spectra dispersed in opposite directions from the image. The zeroth-order image is used to establish the
central reference point for a spectral extraction, and it is also useful for providing a broadband X-ray light curve for
the observation, allowing ﬂares to be identiﬁed. Although we do ﬁnd some modest ﬂares within the data, in all cases
the ﬂares are too weak or brief to contribute greatly to the counts of the overall integrated spectrum, so no attempt
is made to remove any of the ﬂares in the spectral extraction procedure.

For an isolated star, our default procedure assumes a conservatively broad extraction window of ∆s = 30 pixels,
increasing to ∆s = 90 for wavelengths greater than 90 ˚A. The increase in window size is necessary to account for
the worsening spatial resolution at higher wavelengths farther from the aim point. Broad background windows are
extracted on both sides of the source spectrum in order to estimate the background level, which is rather high for the
HRC-S detector. Even though the average background can be accurately measured and subtracted from the source
spectrum, the background is a signiﬁcant source of noise. The HRC-S detector has limited energy resolution, but
some amount of pulse height ﬁltering is possible and can be used to reduce the background. We use the recommended

5

background ﬁlter, following the relevant CIAO analysis thread on the CXC website1. Still, for some of the fainter
targets with noisier spectra, we ﬁnd it necessary to decrease ∆s to minimize the background noise further. We use
extraction windows as narrow as ∆s = 12 pixels in some cases for this reason, although we always expand to ∆s = 90
for wavelengths greater than 90 ˚A. The downside of narrow windows is a degradation of photometric accuracy, but
for noisy spectra this cost is more than balanced by the improvement in signal-to-noise (S/N) due to the decreased
background.

For binary stars it is necessary to avoid overlapping spectral extraction windows, so ∆s can be limited by the stellar
separation for close binaries. In such cases, above 90 ˚A it is generally possible to expand the extraction window in
only one direction to avoid overlapping windows. There will be some degree of unresolved source blending at these
higher wavelengths. We extract separate spectra for the two components of all binaries identiﬁed in Table 2 (e.g., the
stars with “AB” in their names). In most cases, both components are considered in our target sample (see Table 1),
with two exceptions, τ Boo B (M2 V) and AB Dor B (M5 V+M5-6 V). For τ Boo B and AB Dor B, we deem their
spectra to be too noisy with too few detected lines for us to include these sources in our target list.

After background subtraction, the ﬁnal step is to coadd the plus and minus orders. In many cases, it is necessary to
shift either the plus or minus order spectra by up to four pixels before coaddition in order to line up the emission lines.
This is an indication of the uncertainties in the LETGS wavelength calibration, which can vary in an unpredictable
manner from observation to observation.

There are multiple observations listed in Table 2 for four stars. For η Lep, π3 Ori, and τ Boo we simply coadd the
observations to create a ﬁnal spectrum. However, for α Cen AB the three observations are taken far apart in time,
with the two stars at diﬀerent points in their activity cycles. The α Cen system has been monitored regularly in
X-rays by both Chandra and XMM, and using these data Ayres (2014) estimates activity cycle periods of 19.2 ± 0.7
and 8.1 ± 0.2 yr for α Cen A and B, respectively. For α Cen A, the ﬁrst observation (ID #29) occurred near an activity
cycle maximum in 1998, while the last two occurred closer to a minimum in 2008. We therefore consider two separate
α Cen A spectra in our analysis, an α Cen A(hi) spectrum associated with observation ID #29, and an α Cen A(lo)
spectrum that is a coaddition of the other two observations (ID’s #7432 and #12332). Similarly, for α Cen B it is
the third observation that is near an activity cycle maximum, with the other two near minima. Thus, we construct an
α Cen B(hi) spectrum from observation ID #12332, and an α Cen B(lo) spectrum that is a coaddition of the other
two observations (ID’s #29 and #7432).

3. LINE IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

The ﬁrst step in our analysis of the Chandra/LETGS spectra is to identify and measure emission lines in the spectra.
Our approach is to focus ﬁrst on the highest quality spectra in our sample to establish the largest possible list of clearly
detected and identiﬁed lines for the EM analysis, and then we search for only these lines in the other spectra. This is in
eﬀect a Bayesian approach to ﬁnding lines in the noisier spectra, as we will only be looking at the precise wavelengths
where the better quality data have informed us that we might reasonably ﬁnd a line, which in turn allows us to be less
conservative about claiming at least a marginal detection. A 1σ ﬂux excess at exactly the right wavelength where a line
is expected is far more likely to be a detection than a 1σ ﬂux excess at some random location. Even for nondetections,
we estimate upper limits for line ﬂuxes, which will be considered in the EM analysis described below.

The two high-quality spectra used in the initial line identiﬁcation process are those of AB Dor A and α Cen B(lo).
The former provides a representative spectrum of a high-activity star with high coronal temperatures, and the latter
provides a representative spectrum of a low-activity star with low coronal temperatures. These spectra are shown in
Figure 1.

We have already published line lists and spectral analyses for a number of stars in our sample (Wood & Linsky
2006, 2010; Wood & Laming 2013). But we here consider far more lines, many of which are only identiﬁable now with
better atomic data. Our primary line identiﬁcation tool is version 7.1 of the CHIANTI atomic database (Dere et al.
1997; Landi et al. 2012, 2013). However, published line lists for the LETGS spectrum of Procyon are also valuable
for identifying lower temperature lines (Raassen et al. 2002; Beiersdorfer et al. 2014). Table 3 provides our ﬁnal list
of 118 identiﬁed lines. These lines are also noted in Figure 1. A line formation temperature is estimated in the third
column of the table, based on a mean temperature of the line contribution function. Also listed in Table 3 are counts

Given that we are only interested in lines that can be used in our EM analysis, Table 3 does not list any emission
features that are blends of lines of diﬀerent species. In order to be considered here, we have to believe that a line is at
least ∼ 80% from a single species, as ultimately veriﬁed using synthetic spectra computed from the EM distributions
that we derive. Examples of blends visible in Figure 1 that are not considered are the O VIII+Fe XVIII blend at 16.0 ˚A
and the Fe XX+Fe XXIII blend at 132.9 ˚A. We do naturally consider blends of lines of a single species, as we can use
the line strengths in CHIANTI to divide the measured counts among the individual lines in the blend. Converting the

7

Figure 1. (continued)

line counts listed in Table 3 to line ﬂuxes, which are also listed in the table (in units of photons cm−2 s−1), involves not
only dividing the counts by exposure time and eﬀective area, but also dividing the counts into the various individual
lines in the case of blends. This is why, for example, a single count measurement is listed for the Si XIV 6.2 ˚A line, but
two ﬂux measurements are listed for it, as we have divided the counts between the λrest = 6.180 ˚A and λrest = 6.186 ˚A
lines in the blend based on the CHIANTI emissivities.

Perhaps the most extreme single-species line blend is the Fe XX line at 12.8 ˚A, with dozens of Fe XX lines that
are near that wavelength, which can be considered part of the blend. In such cases, our policy is to only list the two
strongest lines in Table 3, and to only consider those two lines in the EM analysis. In the case of the Fe XX line, this
means listing only the λrest = 12.827 ˚A and λrest = 12.845 ˚A lines, even though these two lines account for less than
half the ﬂux of the blend according to the CHIANTI emissivities. However, considering more than two lines in a blend
would give the blend too much weight in the EM analysis, considering that a blended line is ultimately only a single
detected emission feature. We experimented with considering blends as only a single feature in the EM analysis, and
found no signiﬁcant change in our results. For the unresolved density-sensitive He-like triplets Si XIII λ6.7 and Mg XI
λ9.2, we only list the strongest line in Table 3.

In identifying lines in the various spectra, it is necessary to be aware of higher order lines.

In LETGS spectra,
the higher orders are superposed on the ﬁrst order spectrum, although even orders are suppressed somewhat. For
example, in the AB Dor A spectrum the features at 36.4 ˚A and 56.9 ˚A are third-order Ne X λ12.1 and O VIII λ19.0,
respectively. The feature at 40.3 ˚A is not C V at λrest = 40.268 ˚A as Figure 1 might seem to suggest, but is instead
third-order Ne IX λ13.5, at least for AB Dor A.

A few lines are worthy of brief discussion, starting with the feature at 35.7 ˚A. In past analyses, using older versions of
CHIANTI, we identiﬁed this as S XIII (Wood & Linsky 2006, 2010; Wood & Laming 2013). However, with CHIANTI
version 7.1 this identiﬁcation no longer seems to work. Nearby, there is a Ca XI line at 35.6 ˚A that is now in our line
list, but we are no longer sure what the stronger 35.7 ˚A emission is, so it is not identiﬁed in Table 3 or Figure 1.

Figure 2. Illustration of the ionic species with detected emission lines in our sample of main sequence star Chandra/LETGS
spectra. The species are plotted versus line formation temperature. A color scale is used to indicate the number of stars for
which a given species has a detected line.

Another problematic line is at 94 ˚A. For the active stars that represent most of our sample, there is a line centered
at 93.9 ˚A, which is clearly Fe XVIII at λrest = 93.932 ˚A. However, for the inactive α Cen AB stars there is instead a
peak at 94.0 ˚A. This is clearly not Fe XVIII, although for α Cen B(hi) there is a marginal detection of Fe XVIII in
the blue wing of the stronger 94.0 ˚A line. Given the numerous Fe X lines in the spectral region, the suspicion is that
the 94.0 ˚A line is Fe X, but the version 7.1 CHIANTI line emissivities fail to provide an unambiguous identiﬁcation,
given that synthetic spectra fail badly to account for the line (see Figure 1). Testa et al. (2012) discuss the diﬃculties
in modeling this feature in the LETGS spectrum of Procyon. This is an important feature for solar physics, as the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission includes a ﬁlter
bandpass centered at 94 ˚A, allowing the Sun to be monitored at this wavelength. Procedures for removing the low
temperature emission to determine a pure Fe XVIII image have been developed (Warren et al. 2012). These should
work even though current line emissivities cannot reproduce disk-integrated spectra of this region from the Extreme
ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on SDO very well (Schonfeld et al. 2017).

Finally, one of the strongest lines in the α Cen B(lo) spectrum in Figure 1 is the Fe X line at 174.5 ˚A, which lies at
the very end of the LETGS spectral range. However, the LETGS eﬀective area is falling rapidly at this wavelength,
and our experience suggests that the eﬀective areas estimated at this wavelength by the CIAO data reduction software
are unreliable. Thus, we cannot include this line in our analysis.

Figure 2 provides a graphical illustration of the various ionic species that are represented in our line list (e.g.,
Table 3), and how many of them are detected in our sample of stars. The detected lines cover a range of line
formation temperatures from log T = 5.7 − 7.4. For Mg and Si, every species from Mg VII–Mg XII and Si VIII–
Si XIV is represented in the list. For the particularly important Fe sequence, every species from Fe VIII—Fe XXIV is
represented, except for Fe XIII and Fe XXIII. Technically, there are even detected lines of Fe XIII and Fe XXIII at
76.5 ˚A and 132.9 ˚A, respectively (see Figure 1), but these are blends with lines of other species and so do not make
our list. Needless to say, not every species is detected for every star. The species in red in Figure 2 are detected in
nearly every spectrum, while those in green are only detected for a few.

A surprising amount can be learned from the line ﬂux measurements simply by comparing the ﬂuxes of diﬀerent
stars with each other, without the need for the complexity of the EM analysis that will be described in the next
section. With 21 spectra in our sample, there are lots of pairs of stars that can be compared. Figure 3 shows examples
of four such comparisons, plotting line ﬂux ratios versus line formation temperature, with diﬀerent colors indicating
high-FIP (FIP > 10 eV) and low-FIP (FIP < 10 eV) elements. We exclude sulfur lines in these ﬁgures, as S is on
the border between low-FIP and high-FIP. The ﬂux ratios include the obvious corrections for diﬀerences in exposure

temperature, with red (green) points indicating high-FIP (low-FIP) elements.

time, distance, and radius; but there is no attempt to correct for diﬀerent reference photospheric abundances. In cases
where there is more than one line of a given species, we simply add ﬂuxes of all lines detected for both stars before
computing the ﬂux ratio.

In all panels in Figure 3, the more active star with higher ﬂuxes is divided by the less active star with lower line
ﬂuxes. Positive slopes are seen in each panel, demonstrating that coronal temperatures are higher for the more active
stars. Separation between the low-FIP and high-FIP elements indicates a systematically diﬀerent FIP eﬀect. Higher
line ratios are clearly seen for high-FIP elements in Figure 3(a-c). This could be said to indicate a weaker FIP eﬀect for
the more active stars, or alternatively a stronger inverse FIP eﬀect. The FIP bias seems to be relatively independent
of temperature in the sense that we ﬁnd no evidence of high-FIP ratios being higher than low-FIP ratios in one
temperature range and lower in another temperature range. This is important because in the EM analysis described
in the next section, we have to assume uniform abundances throughout the corona. Figure 3(d) compares the “(lo)”
and “(hi)” spectra for α Cen B. The increase in coronal temperature with activity is very clear, but no evidence for
any diﬀerence in FIP bias is apparent.

4. EMISSION MEASURE ANALYSIS

With the line measurements made, the next step is an emission measure analysis to infer coronal temperature
distributions and abundances. This analysis requires assumptions of collisional ionization equilibrium, Maxwellian
velocity distributions, and uniform abundances throughout the corona. There are two deﬁnitions of emission measure
that will be used here, a volume emission measure, EMV (in units of cm−3), and a column emission measure, EMh

(in units of cm−5). For the former,

EMV (T ) ≡ n2
e

dV
d log T

,

(1)

where ne is the coronal density and dV is a coronal volume element. This is the most natural expression of emission
measure for unresolved, disk-integrated sources. Note that we are expressing EMV as a distribution in log T , rather
than T as in some EM deﬁnitions. The observed ﬂux for a given line can be expressed as

f =

1
4πd2 Z

G(T, ne)EMV (T )d log T,

(2)

where d is the stellar distance and G(T, ne) is the line contribution function, which includes both the line emissivity
and the assumed elemental abundance of the atomic species in question.

For spatially resolved data (e.g., solar observations), a column emission measure is more intuitive,

EMh(T ) ≡ n2
e

dh
d log T

.

(3)

This EM version is also more useful when comparing emission measures of stars with diﬀerent radii, which we will be
doing. The distance element dh can be related to dV by dV = 2πR2dh, with R the radius of the star. We assume
2πR2 instead of 4πR2 because the emission from the back side of a star is hidden from us. Thus,

EMV = 2πR2EMh.

(4)

Knowing EMV allows line ﬂuxes to be computed with relative ease using equation (2). However, the inverse problem
of inferring EMV from a set of emission line ﬂux measurements is harder. For this purpose, we use version 2.97 of
the PINTofALE software developed by Kashyap & Drake (2000), which includes a routine for computing emission
measures using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach (Kashyap & Drake 1998). As in Section 3, version 7.1 of the
CHIANTI database is the source of our line emissivities. The ionization equilibrium calculations of Mazzotta et al.
(1998) are used, and we assume a typical coronal density of log ne = 10.

Figure 4. Emission measure distributions computed from the main sequence star Chandra/LETGS spectra in our sample (units
cm−3). The stars are in order of increasing log FX . Dots indicate the best-ﬁt EMV values. The temperature range where a
solid line connects these dots indicates the temperature range constrained by detected emission lines, with only upper limits
contraining the EMs at other temperatures. For α Cen A and B, EMs for both the “(lo)” (black) and “(hi)” (red) spectra
are shown. Green lines indicate full-disk solar EM distributions measured at three diﬀerent times (Schonfeld et al. 2017), with
the blue line in the α Cen B panel showing the intermediate solar distribution renormalized to assume the same coronal Fe
abundance as measured for α Cen B.

The PINTofALE routines include corrections for absorption from the interstellar medium (ISM). For stars as nearby
as ours, ISM column densities are low and the corrections modest, but they are still well worth making for LETGS
data, especially at higher wavelengths above 100 ˚A where the eﬀects of ISM absorption become more important. The
logarithmic ISM hydrogen column densities assumed for our sample of stars, log NH (in units of cm−2), are listed in
Table 4. The primary source for these columns is a compilation of ISM column density measurements from Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) spectra of the H I Lyman-α line (Wood et al. 2005). For π1 UMa, the HST measurement is instead
from Wood et al. (2014), while for τ Boo A log NH is estimated from the Mg II column density of Malamut et al.
(2014) and the Mg depletion for this direction from Redﬁeld & Linsky (2008). The EK Dra value of log NH = 18.08
comes from a new H I Lyman-α measurement that we make from an archival HST spectrum (Ayres 2015). For details
of how this kind of analysis is done, see Wood et al. (2005). For η Lep, π3 Ori, and AB Dor A, no relevant ISM
absorption measurements exist, so we simply assume the log NH values of stars close to these targets in the sky.
Speciﬁcally, for η Lep, π3 Ori, and AB Dor A the ISM columns listed in Table 4 are actually those measured towards
HD 43162, χ1 Ori, and ζ Dor, respectively (Wood et al. 2005).

Figure 4 shows the EMV distributions derived by the EM analysis. The EMs are computed from log T = 5.5 to

log T = 7.8, with a resolution of 0.1 dex. Error bars are 90% conﬁdence intervals suggested by the Monte Carlo analysis.
Technically, the line-based EM analysis only determines the shape of the EM distribution. A line-to-continuum ratio
analysis is required to normalize it properly, which will be described below. The temperature range in which the
best-ﬁt EMs are connected by a solid line provides an estimate of the temperature range actually constrained by
detected lines, which is estimated from the peak temperatures of the line contribution functions, G(T, ne). The lower
temperature bound is deﬁned by the lowest peak temperature minus 0.3 dex, and the higher bound is the highest peak
temperature plus 0.3 dex. Outside this range, the actual constraints on EM are minimal. The “best-ﬁt” EM values
and the lower bounds indicated in the ﬁgure mean little outside this range, but the upper bounds are well constrained
because the EM analysis does consider upper limits for all the undetected lines.

The EMs in Figure 4 are shown in order of increasing activity level, based on the logarithmic FX values indicated in
the ﬁgure (in erg cm−2 s−1 units), which are computed from the radii and X-ray luminosities in Table 1. The general
increase in both the magnitude of EMV and the mean coronal temperature with log FX is apparent. For α Cen A and
B, both the “(lo)” and “(hi)” versions of the EM distribution are shown.

5. CORONAL ABUNDANCE MEAUREMENTS

In the EM analysis, the abundances of elements with lines of detected species are free parameters of the ﬁts. However,
the line-based analysis can only measure relative abundances, not the absolute abundances (i.e., the abundances relative
to the dominant element, H). Given the prevalence of Fe lines in our spectra, Fe is the most obvious reference element
to use for quoting relative abundances. Thus, the coronal abundances relative to Fe measured by the EM analysis are
listed in Tables 4 and 5, with high-FIP elements listed in the former and low-FIP elements listed in the latter. We
follow the common convention where abundances surrounded by square brackets are logarithmic, so the abundances
in Tables 4 and 5 are listed in logarithmic form. Error bars are 90% conﬁdence intervals, as in Figure 4.

The scattering processes that dominate continuum emission at X-ray wavelengths depend mostly on the abundances
of H and He (e.g., Drake 1998), so the line-to-continuum ratio provides a measure of absolute abundances. With all

determine absolute coronal abundances. The zero ﬂux level is indicated by a horizontal black line. Blue lines indicate the
inferred continuum level, based on the EM distributions in Figure 4. The red lines are the ﬁnal synthetic spectra after the
inclusion of the line emission. The absolute iron abundance suggested by the continuum level, [Fe/H], is indicated in each panel,
with the panels arranged in order of increasing [Fe/H]. Values in green are assumed rather than measured, as these are cases
where we do not have a statistically signiﬁcant detection of the continuum.

coronal abundances measured relative to Fe from the emission line analysis, determining absolute abundances reduces
to measuring the absolute abundance of Fe, i.e. [Fe/H]. We experimented with a number of diﬀerent ways to do the
line-to-continuum analysis, using various wavelength regions. We even explored a sophisticated approach of allowing
the considered wavelength regions to be diﬀerent for diﬀerent stars depending on where the highest continuum S/N is
after line subtraction. However, this more complex approach did not seem to lead to any clear advantage, so for the
sake of simplicity we ultimately focus exclusively on the 25 − 40 ˚A region, which is relatively devoid of strong emission
lines, except for C VI λ33.7, but is still at wavelengths short enough where the continuum is stronger.

Figure 5 shows the LETGS 25 − 40 ˚A spectra. Our procedure for measuring the continuum level here involves
ﬁrst measuring the total ﬂux in this range (skipping a narrow wavelength region around the C VI line), and then
subtracting from this ﬂux the integrated emission line ﬂux inferred from a synthetic 25 − 40 ˚A spectrum computed
using the EM distribution in Figure 4. This provides a continuum ﬂux estimate, fcont. Using the relevant PINTofALE
procedures, we determine the absolute Fe abundance, [Fe/H], necessary to yield a continuum that reproduces fcont.
Figure 5 shows both the continuum-only and total line-plus-continuum synthetic spectra.

The inferred [Fe/H] values are indicated in Figure 5. The absolute Fe abundances are also listed in Table 5, but in

14

the table we list them as [Fe/Fe∗], in order to indicate the coronal Fe abundance relative to the stellar photospheric Fe
abundance from Table 1. For each fcont measurement, we also measure a Poissonian uncertainty based on the noise of
the spectrum, and for eight of our spectra we ﬁnd fcont is less than 2σ above the noise. For these spectra, we conclude
that we do not have a statistically signiﬁcant detection of the continuum, meaning that we cannot make a meangful
measurement of [Fe/H]. For these eight cases, we have to assume [Fe/H] by other means. The assumed values are
ﬂagged in Table 5 and colored green in Figure 5.

For τ Boo A and π1 UMa the solution is to simply use published [Fe/H] measurements from XMM (Telleschi et al.
2005; Maggio et al. 2011). Observations from XMM are well suited for continuum measurement, with the high sensi-
tivity of RGS and the possibility of considering spectra from both RGS and from the EPIC instrument. Pulse height
spectra from EPIC do not provide much spectral resolution, but this is far less important for continuum measurement
than for line measurement. In contrast, LETGS is not ideal for continuum measurements, as the high background
of the HRC-S detector can make it diﬃcult to detect weak continua. For emission lines, this problem is mitigated
somewhat by the excellent spectral resolution of LETGS, which means the emission is isolated to a limited number of
pixels with therefore a limited number of background counts. But high spectral resolution is less helpful for detecting
weak continuum emission.

This still leaves us with six spectra with no [Fe/H] measurement [61 Cyg A, 36 Oph B, 70 Oph a, η Lep, α Cen A(hi),
and α Cen A(lo)]. Estimates of some sort are required, as the [Fe/H] values are not only of interest in their own
right, but are also necessary to normalize the EM distributions. Increasing [Fe/H] would correspond to lowering the
EMV curves in Figure 4. We will use our existing [Fe/H] measurements to estimate [Fe/H] for the stars without a
measurement, but before describing that in detail we ﬁrst discuss the Fbias values listed in the ﬁnal column of Table 4.
The “FIP-bias” parameter, Fbias, represents an attempt to deﬁne a simple metric that can be used to quantify
It is the average logarithmic abundance of four
a star’s coronal abundance characteristics (Wood & Linsky 2010).
high-FIP elements (C, N, O, and Ne) relative to Fe, which is the best-constrained low-FIP element. This abundance
ratio is computed relative to stellar photospheric abundances. Figure 6 shows explicitly how Fbias is derived for our
sample of LETGS-observed stars. In the ﬁgure, the abundance ratios of the six best-measured coronal abundances
relative to Fe ([X/Fe] from Tables 4 and 5) are plotted versus FIP (in eV), with a correction for the stellar photospheric
abundance ratios, [X/Fe]∗, from Table 1. Thus, a value of 0.0 corresponds to a coronal abundance ratio identical to
that of the stellar photosphere.

The abundance ratios in Figure 6 use the stellar photospheric abundance ﬁgures in Table 1, which must be converted
to absolute abundances by assuming solar reference abundances. For that purpose, we use Asplund et al. (2009). No
photospheric abundances are listed in Table 1 for N or Ne, as no stellar measurements exist for these elements. For
N, we simply use O as a proxy, assuming [N∗/N⊙]=[O∗/O⊙], with the N abundance ratios in Figure 6 reﬂecting this
assumption. The situation for Ne is more complicated, as no direct photospheric measurements are possible even for
the Sun, due to a lack of photospheric Ne lines. Solar Ne abundances are instead inferred from coronal and transition
region lines. The Ne abundance is often quoted relative to O, another high-FIP element. The Asplund et al. (2009)
tabulation suggests Ne/O=0.17, but much higher Ne/O values are generally found for stellar coronae. In particular,
Drake & Testa (2005) ﬁnd Ne/O=0.41. The most recent solar measurement from Young (2018) ﬁnds Ne/O=0.24, which
is a higher value than reported before but still well below the stellar value. It remains debatable which measurement
is preferable to represent the reference photospheric Ne abundance, but we follow past practice (e.g., Wood & Laming
2013) and use the Drake & Testa (2005) Ne/O ratio.

In Figure 6, Fbias is simply the average value of the four high-FIP elements, minus N in a few cases where no N
lines are detected. This average is shown explicitly in the ﬁgure, with the stars displayed in order of increasing Fbias.
Values below 0.0 represent a solar-like FIP eﬀect, while values above 0.0 represent an inverse FIP eﬀect. We compute
a standard deviation of the four individual ratios, and use that as an estimate of the uncertainty in Fbias. The Fbias
values and their uncertainties are listed in Table 4.

At this point, we can compare our EM distributions and Fbias measurements with ones made in the past, both
from previous analyses of the same LETGS data studied here and from analyses of other data (e.g., XMM). We ﬁnd
two surprising diﬀerences. The ﬁrst is that our new Fbias measurements are systematically higher than before. The
mean and standard deviation of the diﬀerence is ∆Fbias = +0.084 ± 0.052. (See Table 2 of Wood et al. (2012) for a
list of previous Fbias measurements.) The second diﬀerence concerns the shape of the EM distributions. A feature
that we emphasized in the past was a surprisingly sharp peak in the EM distribution at log T = 6.6, which seemed
ubiquitous and particularly convincing for high S/N data (Wood & Linsky 2010; Wood & Laming 2013). However, in
Figure 4 such sharp and narrow peaks at log T = 6.6 do not exist. There is still generally an EM maximum near this
temperature, but the exact log T = 6.6 temperature is no longer emphasized like it was before.

Figure 6. Coronal abundances of six elements relative to Fe, [X/Fe], versus FIP (in eV), relative to the stellar photospheric
ratio, [X/Fe]∗. A vertical dotted line separates the low-FIP elements (Mg and Si) from the high-FIP elements (C, N, O, and
Ne). The dot-dashed line is the average value of the four high-FIP elements, which is the Fbias parameter listed in Table 4. The
stars are shown in order of increasing Fbias.

We trace both changes to large adjustments in the emissivities of Fe XVII lines in version 7.1 of CHIANTI, compared
to older versions (Landi et al. 2012). There are four Fe XVII lines in the 15 − 17 ˚A range in our line list, which are
usually the strongest Fe lines in the entire LETGS spectral range. These lines have rest wavelengths of λrest = 15.013 ˚A,
16.776 ˚A, 17.051 ˚A, and 17.096 ˚A; the last two being in an unresolved blend. The emissivity of the λrest = 15.013 ˚A
line changed little from version 6 of CHIANTI, but the other three increased by an average of 60%. The strength of
these Fe XVII lines makes it particularly important for an EM analysis to reproduce these line ﬂuxes. With the line
emissivities being apparently underestimated in the past, the EM reconstruction routine (PINTofALE in our case)
would correct for this in two ways: 1. Increase the Fe abundance (thereby decreasing Fbias), and 2. Create a sharp
EM spike at log T = 6.6, which is the peak of the Fe XVII line contribution function. Further discussion of diﬃculties
with Fe XVII emissivities can be found elsewhere (Beiersdorfer et al. 2004; Liang & Badnell 2010; Bernitt et al. 2012).
For our purposes, this serves as a reminder that uncertainties in line emissivities remain a crucial factor limiting the
accuracy of EM analyses.

In Figure 7(a), Fbias is plotted versus spectral type, reproducing the FBST relation discussed in Section 1. In plots
such as this, it is worthwhile to supplement our Chandra/LETGS measurements with other published results. Table 6
lists 10 stars with published X-ray spectral analyses, from which we can extract both Fbias and [Fe/Fe∗] values. These
include the Sun, for which Schmelz et al. (2012) measures [Fe/Fe∗]=0.33 and Fbias = −0.48. Table 6 also includes

an LETGS Fbias measurement for GJ 338 AB. The GJ 338 AB spectrum was not of suﬃcient quality for a full EM
analysis, but an Fbias value could be estimated from the Fe XVII/O VIII line ratio (Wood et al. 2012). The other
measurements are either from XMM/RGS or Chandra/HETGS data. We expect all the published analyses (excepting
the Sun) will be aﬀected by the aforementioned issue with the Fe XVII line emissivities. Thus, based on our experience
with the LETGS sample, we have adjusted the Fbias values in Table 6 by +0.084.

As reported in past studies, we ﬁnd that the relation between Fbias and spectral type is surprisingly tight for main
sequence stars (see Section 1). However, this is the case only if one ignores particularly active stars with log LX > 29
(or log FX > 7). The three stars in our sample that fall in this category (EK Dra, AB Dor A, and AU Mic) are identiﬁed
in red in Figure 7. In all three cases, the points lie well above the FBST relation. Evolved stars such as Procyon
(F5 IV-V) and Capella (G8 III+G1 III) also seem to universally lie above the FBST relation (Wood & Laming 2013).
The τ Boo A data point is also shown in red in Figure 7, as it seems slightly high. Assessing whether τ Boo’s coronal
abundances are aﬀected by the presence of its close-in, massive exoplanet is one goal of our analysis (see Section 8).

Aside from the systematic changes in Fbias noted above, there are two other notable changes to the FBST relation
in Figure 7(a) compared to past work. One is the inclusion of error bar estimates for Fbias. The second and more
important change is the extension of the relation to A and early F spectral types. For the ﬁrst time, we can deﬁnitively
show that Fbias values do not continue to decrease beyond early G spectral types. Solar-like Fbias values are seen from

late A to early G.

The assessment of the FBST relation for earlier type stars is possible thanks to the consideration of the very
recent LETGS observation of η Lep (F1 V) and the inclusion of the XMM measurement for Altair (A7 V), from
Robrade & Schmitt (2009). The primary reason Altair had not been considered before was that Altair’s spectral type
is sometimes listed as A7 IV-V. Our experience with Procyon (F5 IV-V) suggests that luminosity class IV-V stars can
be inconsistent with the FBST relation (Wood & Laming 2013). However, we have now concluded that we can consider
Altair a main sequence star for our purposes, primarily because the Fbias measurements of Altair and η Lep provide
a consistent picture of an FBST relation that is ﬂat at early spectral types (late A through early G). Altair’s surface
gravity is signiﬁcantly higher than Procyon’s, and closer to that expected for the main sequence (Malagnini & Morossi
1990). Altair’s mean radius of 1.93 R⊙ might be considered consistent with an A7 V spectral type, considering the
rapid rotation and resulting asphericity of this star (Ohishi et al. 2004). Peterson et al. (2006) conclude that Altair is
close to the zero-age main sequence despite the IV-V classiﬁcation.

Figure 7(b) shows another version of the FBST relation, with photospheric temperature replacing spectral type on
the x-axis. This substitution makes it easier for us to actually quantify the FBST relation. We perform a linear
ﬁt to the Fbias measurements (ignoring the red data points), with a ﬂattening at a temperature that is another free
parameter of the ﬁt. The resulting relation is

Fbias = 


1.77 − 3.85 × 10−4 Tef f
−0.47

for Tef f < 5804

for Tef f > 5804.

(5)

The 1σ scatter of the Fbias values about the best ﬁt is ±0.104. Figure 7(b) shows the 1σ and 2σ deviations from the
best ﬁt. The four red points that we have considered inconsistent with the FBST relation (albeit only tentatively for
τ Boo A) are indeed above the 2σ line, although a single green point (ǫ Eri) is slightly above as well.



Switching from the relative abundances represented by Fbias to the absolute abundances represented by [Fe/Fe∗],
Figure 7(c) plots [Fe/Fe∗] versus photospheric temperature. If the four red points are ignored, there seems to be a
clear correlation, albeit with more scatter than the Fbias relations in Figures 7(a-b). A linear ﬁt yields

[Fe/Fe∗] = −1.29 + 2.18 × 10−4 Tef f .

(6)

Unlike for the relative abundances, there is no evidence for a ﬂattening of the relation at early spectral types. This
conclusion, however, relies almost entirely on the Altair measurement, and suﬀers from our inability to detect the
continuum and measure [Fe/Fe∗] for η Lep. We can now return to the issue of what to assume for [Fe/Fe∗] in the six
cases where we do not have an X-ray continuum detection [61 Cyg A, 36 Oph B, 70 Oph a, η Lep, α Cen A(hi), and
α Cen A(lo)]. For these six cases, we simply use equation (6) to estimate [Fe/Fe∗], and these are the values listed in

(2018) in red.

Table 5 for those stars.

The four red points all lie below the relation in Figure 7(c). While τ Boo A is only marginally inconsistent with the
FBST relation in Figures 7(a-b), it is very inconsistent with the relation in Figure 7(c), providing further support for
the star’s coronal abundances being considered anomalous. We will discuss τ Boo further in Section 8.

Aside from the Fbias parameter, the individual element abundance measurements in Tables 4 and 5 can be perused
to search for interesting behavior speciﬁc to particular elements. One example particularly worthy of note involves the
coronal Si abundances of M dwarfs. In Figure 7(d), Si abundances relative to Fe are plotted versus Tef f , with corrections
for the reference photospheric abundances. For most stars, there is no dramatic diﬀerence between the coronal and
photospheric Si/Fe ratio. The exceptions are the Tef f < 4000 K stars, i.e. the M dwarfs, which collectively have high
coronal Si/Fe. The various panels of Figure 7 imply that for M dwarfs, low-FIP elements are coronally depleted by
a factor of 3 − 4, while the high-FIP element abundances are roughly photospheric. The exception is the low-FIP Si,
which seems to behave more like a high-FIP element, with roughly photospheric coronal abundances.

One of the deﬁning characteristics of M dwarf photospheres is the formation of molecules. And for Si, the dominant
molecule will be SiO (Tsuji 1973; Hauschildt et al. 1999). The other low-FIP elements that we are concerned with,
Mg and Fe, are less inclined to form molecules, and the molecules that they do form (e.g., MgH and FeH) are more
easily dissociated than SiO, which has a relatively high dissociation energy of 8.18 ± 0.17 eV (Reddy et al. 1998). We
propose that the robustness of SiO leads to Si behaving more like a high-FIP element for M dwarfs, leading to the
high Si/Fe ratios seen in Figure 7(d). Exploring this hypothesis further would require more detailed modeling than
we can provide here.

Finally, the coronal Ne abundances are worthy of discussion, due to their relevance for establishing the true cosmic
abundance of Ne. Solar photospheric measurements are often used as reference “cosmic abundances” throughout
astronomy, but there are no photospheric Ne lines, so the solar Ne abundance is instead estimated from transition
region and coronal lines (Schmelz et al. 2005; Young 2005). Considering that Ne is one of the most abundant elements
in the universe, establishing the proper cosmic abundance of Ne has broad ramiﬁcations. The Ne abundance is often
measured relative to O, another high-FIP element. The reference solar photospheric abundances used here, from
Asplund et al. (2009), assume Ne/O = 0.17 ± 0.05. However, stellar coronal measurements tend to be much higher
than this, with Drake & Testa (2005) ﬁnding a weighted mean of Ne/O = 0.41 for a sample of 23 stars, with none of
the stellar measurements as low as the solar one.

This raises two questions: 1. Why are the solar and stellar Ne/O measurements in disagreement, and 2. Which

19

value should be used to deﬁne the reference cosmic Ne abundance? As for the ﬁrst question, Robrade et al. (2008)
found evidence for lower stellar Ne/O ratios for less active stars, and argued that the low solar value may not be
as inconsistent as the Drake & Testa (2005) sample suggests, since the sample is dominated by stars far more active
than the Sun. In Figure 8, we look for an activity correlation for Ne/O within our sample of main sequence stars.
The Ne/O values in the ﬁgure are from Table 4, with uncertainties estimated from the standard deviation of the
Ne/O values computed during PINTofALE’s numerous Monte Carlo trials. Excluding the anomalously high value for
α Cen A(lo), we ﬁnd a weighted mean of Ne/O = 0.39, in good agreement with Drake & Testa (2005). However, unlike
Robrade et al. (2008), we see no evidence for any activity dependence, and like the Drake & Testa (2005) sample, not
one of our measurements is as low as the solar one.

Nevertheless, the solar/stellar discrepancy has still improved somewhat, thanks mostly to the recent upward revision
of the solar Ne/O ratio by Young (2018) to Ne/O = 0.24 ± 0.05. (see Figure 8). This measurement is from the quiet
Sun transition region. Landi & Testa (2015) ﬁnd that Ne/O can be variable in the solar corona, with a high value
of Ne/O = 0.25 ± 0.05 corresponding to the lowest activity corona, consistent with Young (2018). The most relevant
comparison stars for the Sun in our sample are α Cen A and B. Our four measurements for those two stars are
Ne/O = 1.15 ± 0.19, 0.46 ± 0.08, 0.29 ± 0.05, and 0.36 ± 0.04 for α Cen A(lo), α Cen A(hi), α Cen B(lo), and
α Cen B(hi), respectively. The very high α Cen A(lo) value is clearly anomalous, and we disregard it when computing
the weighted mean quoted above. The α Cen A(lo) spectrum is the only one in our sample where Ne IX λ13.5 is
undetected and O VIII λ19.0 is just barely detected. The other α Cen Ne/O values, however, are reasonably consistent
with those of the more active stars in our sample. Note that Liefke & Schmitt (2006) measured Ne/O = 0.28 from
XMM spectra of α Cen AB combined, which will be dominated by the brighter α Cen B. This is only a little lower
than our α Cen B measurements.

It remains an open question as to whether the cosmic Ne abundance is best assumed to be the new Ne/O = 0.24±0.05
solar value from Young (2018), or our new stellar average of Ne/O = 0.39. The solar value has the advantage of being
from the transition region, where fractionation eﬀects are believed to be less pronounced than in the corona. The
stellar measurement has the advantage of coming from multiple sources.

6. THE DISCONCERTING ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCE MEASUREMENTS

The term “FIP eﬀect” is often used to describe the coronal abundance anomalies seen in the solar corona. But
the Fbias and [Fe/Fe∗] quantities in Figures 7(b-c) represent two fundamentally diﬀerent ways of thinking about the
“FIP eﬀect,” the former involving relative abundances and the latter involving absolute abundances. This can lead to
signiﬁcant confusion with regards to terminology. If it is said that a star has a solar-like FIP eﬀect, does this mean
low-FIP elements are enhanced relative to high-FIP elements, or does it mean that the absolute abundances of low-FIP
elements are enhanced?

There is no distinction if high-FIP elements are not fractionated relative to H, which is after all a high-FIP element.
The dashed line in Figure 7(c) shows explicitly what the [Fe/Fe∗] curve should look like if high-FIP elements were
rigidly tied to H, based on equation (5). There is signiﬁcant discrepancy from the observed relation. The comparison
suggests that high-FIP coronal abundances are roughly photospheric for A and M stars, but are depleted for FGK
stars. The Sun provides some evidence that high-FIP depletion is at least possible, with He in the slow solar wind
being depleted by about a factor of two (von Steiger et al. 1995).

Figure 7(b) shows clearly that for solar-like G stars, low-FIP elements are enhanced relative to high-FIP elements,
and that the stellar measurements are nicely consistent with those of the solar corona. In contrast, the linear ﬁt in
Figure 7(c) seems to imply that the absolute abundances of Fe in G star coronae are little diﬀerent from photospheric,
meaning that the relative abundance eﬀect in Figure 7(b) is actually due primarily to depletion of high-FIP elements
rather than an enhancement of low-FIP elements, in contrast to what is assumed to be the case for the Sun. In short,
it is not clear that the G dwarf absolute abundance measurements are consistent with the solar coronal measurements.
The solar data point seems to be uncomfortably high in Figure 7(c), higher than the other G stars, and higher than
all other stars except for Altair. The problem is even worse if the Schmelz et al. (2012) measurement of solar [Fe/Fe∗]
is replaced with the older but more canonical [Fe/Fe∗]=+0.6 value of Feldman & Laming (2000). This replacement
would make the solar point in Figure 7(c) even more inconsistent with the stellar relation. So are we to say that early
G stars have solar-like FIP eﬀects or not? In terms of relative abundances (e.g., Figure 7b) they deﬁnitely do, but in
terms of absolute abundances (e.g., Figure 7c) they may not.

Both the signiﬁcant scatter seen in Figure 7(c) and the questionable consistency between the solar and stellar
measurements cast doubt on the accuracy of the absolute abundance measurements, which rely on the line-to-continuum
ratio analysis. Possible pitfalls in this analysis have been discussed by Drake (1998) and G¨udel (2004). A particularly

20

important one involves the possibility that extensive blends of weak emission lines that are not in CHIANTI might
be mistaken for the continuum. Is it possible that our continuum estimates in Figure 5 (blue lines) are too high due
to the presence of a plethora of unknown, highly blended, weak emission lines in the 25 − 40 ˚A region? This would
lead to underestimates of [Fe/Fe∗], and if ubiquitous could push the stellar values upwards to be more consistent
with the currently accepted solar value. Landi et al. (2013) provide an example of how numerous weak lines added in
CHIANTI v7.1 signiﬁcantly change and improve the appearance of synthetic spectra from 80–120 ˚A, when compared
with CHIANTI v7.0. A similar change in the 25 − 40 ˚A region would have a dramatic eﬀect on our line-to-continuum
analysis.

It is worth noting that solar studies also have a history of ambiguity with regards to the issue of whether the solar
coronal FIP eﬀect is one of low-FIP enhancement or high-FIP depletion (Feldman & Widing 2003). Past claims of
high-FIP depletions include Veck & Parkinson (1981), Fludra & Schmelz (1995), and Raymond et al. (1997). Current
preference for the low-FIP enhancement interpretation comes in part from direct particle measurements of the slow solar
wind, which are more suggestive of low-FIP enhancement and photospheric high-FIP; except for the aforementioned
high-FIP He, with its factor of two depletion (von Steiger et al. 2000). Radio observations of the Sun also seem
to provide support for a roughly factor of four enhacement of low-FIP elements in the corona (White et al. 2000;
Schonfeld et al. 2015).

Direct comparison of the Sun with the most solar-like stars in our smaple, α Cen A and B, provides further cause
In Figure 4 the EM distributions of α Cen A

and B, are compared with solar distributions from (Schonfeld et al. 2017), from full-disk SDO/EVE spectra. The
three solar distributions, from Figure 9 of Schonfeld et al. (2017), represent a range of activity states for the solar
corona. Signiﬁcant variation in EMV is observed only for log T > 6.1. This is very consistent with what we ﬁnd when
comparing the “(lo)” and “(hi)” EM distributions for α Cen A and B, where we see little variation for log T < 6.1.

Although it is α Cen A that is generally considered the true Sun-like star of the α Cen binary, due to its identical G2 V
spectral type, it is α Cen B that seems most similar to the Sun in terms of coronal properties. Not only are the log FX
values measured for α Cen B the most solar-like, the shape of the α Cen B EM distribution is also the most similar
to the Sun. In contrast, the α Cen A corona is cooler and has signiﬁcantly lower FX . Despite the coronal similarities,
the magnitudes of EMV are somewhat lower for the solar distributions than for α Cen B. This is mostly due to the
diﬀerent [Fe/Fe∗] assumed in normalizing the EMV curves. Schonfeld et al. (2017) simply assume [Fe/Fe∗] = +0.6
(Schonfeld et al. 2015), while for α Cen B we have measured identical [Fe/Fe∗] = −0.61 values from both the “(lo)”
and “(hi)” spectra. The higher reference photospheric Fe abundance for α Cen B ([Fe∗/Fe⊙] = 0.27 from Table 1)
moderates this discrepancy somewhat, but the coronal Fe abundance diﬀerence still adds up to 0.94 dex. The α Cen B
panel in Figure 4 shows the improved agreement between the intermediate solar EMV curve and the α Cen B(hi)
distribution when the solar EMV curve is renormalized to assume the α Cen B coronal Fe abundance. Could it really
be true that the Sun and α Cen B are coronally so similar in terms of X-ray ﬂux and temperature distribution, but
still exhibit radically diﬀerent absolute abundance behavior, with the Sun having a substantial enhancement of Fe and
α Cen B having a dramatic depletion?

Another coronal abundance comparison that can be made between the Sun and α Cen AB concerns the issue of
activity cycle variability. Brooks et al. (2017) present evidence for a solar cycle variation of FIP bias, with a stronger
FIP eﬀect at solar maximum. However, for both α Cen A and B, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the Fbias or
[Fe/Fe∗] measurements from the “(lo)” and “(hi)” spectra. This conclusion is evident even without an EM analysis,
as shown in Figure 3(d). Thus, we conclude that α Cen AB coronal abundances do not vary signiﬁcantly during the
stellar activity cycles (Ayres 2014). The tightness of the FBST relation in Figure 7(a-b) by itself might imply little
time variation of Fbias, considering the stars will have been observed at diﬀerent points in their various activity cycles.
However, most of these stars are signiﬁcantly more active than the Sun, and such stars tend to have more irregular
activity cycles (Ol´ah et al. 2016; Radick et al. 2018).

7. EMISSION MEASURE VARIATION WITH ACTIVITY

We now use the sample of EM distributions in Figure 4 to assess how the EMs of main sequence stars vary with
stellar activity. The Figure 4 distributions are provided in temperature bins with widths of 0.1 dex in log T . For
each log T bin, we can plot the measured EM values at that temperature versus FX for our sample of stars. Six of
these plots are shown in Figure 9, for six diﬀerent temperatures. We have converted from EMV to EMh to correct
for the diﬀerent radii of our stars. For each temperature bin, we ﬁnd a reasonably smooth and consistent variation of
EMh with FX , with no evidence for any substantial spectral type variation. The M, K, and FG dwarfs seem to be
consistent with each other. We ﬁt third-order polynomials to the data points. Increases in EMh with FX are seen at

The relations are shown for six diﬀerent temperature bins. The data are ﬁtted with third order polynomials.

all temperatures, but the relations are relatively ﬂat for log T ≤ 6.3. The slope of the relation increases greatly for
log T > 6.3. It is remarkable that at log T = 6.3, EMh for the extremely active EK Dra is not much higher than for
the comparatively inactive α Cen B(hi), but at log T = 6.6 the diﬀerence balloons to over three orders of magnitude.
The polynomial ﬁts to the EMh(T ) versus FX relations can be used to deﬁne an average EM distribution as a
function of FX . This is done in Figure 10, which shows how a main sequence star EMh distribution varies with FX
for log FX = 3.9 − 7.5. These curves are also provided in Table 7. This information can be used to estimate an
EM distribution for any main sequence star that only has a broadband X-ray ﬂux measurement. It can also be used
as the basis for future theoretical coronal heating models seeking to describe how heating changes with increasing
stellar activity. If mean coronal temperatures are computed from these curves as prescribed by Johnstone & G¨udel
(2015), we can reproduce their power law relation between Tcor and FX . Speciﬁcally, with Tcor in MK units we ﬁnd
Tcor = 0.16F 0.24

X , compared with Johnstone & G¨udel’s Tcor = 0.11F 0.26
X .

The stellar EM distributions in Figure 10 are compared with three solar distributions, representing the quiet Sun
(QS), solar active region (AR), and ﬂaring (FL) Sun. The QS distribution is based on spectra from the EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode (Kamio & Mariska 2012). The AR distribution is an average of 15 ARs studied by
Warren et al. (2012) using EIS and SDO/AIA data. Finally, the FL distribution is an average distribution from the
peaks of 21 strong ﬂares studied by Warren (2014) using SDO/EVE spectra.

In solar physics, decades of ﬂare monitoring with the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
spacecraft have led to the widespread use of the GOES system’s classiﬁcation of ﬂare strength, with the A, B, C, M,
and X classes representing increasing decades of ﬂare luminosity in the 1 − 8 ˚A bandpass. The 21 ﬂares used to deﬁne
the FL distribution range from M9.3 to X6.9. The individual ﬂare EMs are shown explicitly in Figure 11(a), where we
focus only on the 2-minute interval of maximum inegrated EM. Besides using them to compute the average FL EM
for Figure 10, we also compute synthetic spectra from them, and from those spectra we estimate X-ray luminosities
in the 5 − 120 ˚A bandpass most familiar to stellar astronomers. In Figure 11(b), these X-ray luminosities are plotted

These are compared with an average solar active region distribution from Warren et al. (2012), a quiet Sun distribution from
Kamio & Mariska (2012), and an average solar ﬂare distribution from Warren (2014). The ﬁrst two are from spatially resolved
data, so these are true line-of-sight column emission measures, while the ﬂare distribution is from disk-integrated data, so the
EMh values are derived assuming the emission is uniformly spread over the visible surface.

versus the GOES X-ﬂare classiﬁcation, Xf (e.g., for an X5.2 ﬂare, Xf = 5.2; for an M7.5 ﬂare, Xf = 0.75). Not
surprisingly, log LX increases with ﬂare strength, with the ﬁt to the data suggesting log LX = 0.56 log Xf + 27.75. A
typical X-ﬂare has log LX ≈ 28.0, which is about ﬁve times the Sun’s quiescent X-ray luminosity, but is less than the
quiescent emission from most of our stars (see Table 1).

There is an important distinction between the QS and AR distributions and the FL distribution in Figure 10. The
former are from spatially resolved observations, so the EMh values are line-of-sight column emission measures. Thus,
these curves are indicative of the actual intensities of QS and AR regions. In contrast, the FL measurements are from
disk-integrated SDO/EVE spectra, so EMh(T ) is computed in the same manner as for the stars, namely by computing
EMV and then converting to a column EMh by dividing by the visible surface area of the star. In order to scale the FL
EMh curve to indicate the actual ﬂare intensity, it is necessary to divide the curve by the fractional surface coverage
of a ﬂare. For the 21 ﬂares from Warren (2014), we estimate an average surface coverage of 0.3%. This corresponds
to increasing the FL curve in Figure 10 by 2.5 dex.

We can compute synthetic spectra and X-ray luminosities for each of the solar EM distributions in Figure 10,
and for the Schonfeld et al. (2017) full-disk solar EM distributions in Figure 4. We ﬁnd log LX = 26.40, 28.66, and
27.94 for the QS, AR, and FL distributions, respectively, while the Schonfeld et al. (2017) distributions imply a range
of log LX = 26.86 − 27.40. The QS value represents an estimate of the minimum possible X-ray luminosity for a
solar-like G star. To generalize to main sequence stars with diﬀerent radii, this corresponds to a minimum surface
ﬂux of log FX = 3.61. This is only about a factor of two lower than the lowest activity spectrum in our sample,
that of α Cen A(lo). We are not aware of any main sequence stars with detected X-ray ﬂuxes below this limit (e.g.,
Schmitt & Liefke 2004). In principle, lower X-ray luminosities might be expected for very low metallicity stars, due

24

to weak emission lines. However, the models of Suzuki (2018) suggest that such stars may end up brighter in X-rays
due to much higher coronal densities.

Judge et al. (2017) recently found a very low upper limit for the X-ray luminosity of 16 Cyg B (G3 V), log LX < 25.5,
which is much lower than the minimum QS level of log LX = 26.4 just quoted in the previous paragraph. However,
the 16 Cyg observations are Chandra ACIS-I data, which covers an energy range of 0.3 − 2.5 keV, compared to the
more traditional 0.1 − 2.4 keV ROSAT/PSPC range that we are using. These ranges seem similar, but the similarity
is illusory for very inactive stars, as an inactive star will emit far more ﬂux in the 0.1 − 0.3 keV bandpass than it will
at > 0.3 keV, due to the very low coronal temperatures. At > 0.3 keV, an extremely inactive star’s emission will be
mostly from the O VII triplet at 22 ˚A and the C VI line at 33.7 ˚A. For an energy range of 0.3 − 2.5 keV we ﬁnd
log LX = 25.37 and log FX = 2.59 for the QS distribution, a full order of magnitude lower than the 0.1 − 2.4 keV values
quoted above. This 0.3 − 2.5 keV QS luminosity is not inconsistent with the very low 16 Cyg B limit of Judge et al.
(2017). The luminosities inferred from the Schonfeld et al. (2017) distributions decrease to log LX = 26.15 − 26.96
in the 0.3 − 2.5 keV range, more consistent with the α Cen AB luminosities quoted by Ayres (2014), which are for
0.2 − 2 keV.

It is impressive that the stellar EMh distributions in Figure 10 end up matching the solar AR distribution so well for
log T < 6.6, in terms of both magnitude and slope of the distribution. This is true despite the solar and stellar analyses
relying on completely diﬀerent sets of emission lines measured from completely diﬀerent wavelength regions. Between
log FX = 5.0 and log FX = 6.5, the EMh curves basically lie right on top of each other for log T < 6.4, suggestive of
a saturation eﬀect. This apparent saturation at close to the EMh level of the solar AR distribution strongly supports
the idea ﬁrst suggested by Drake et al. (2000) that the EM distributions of intermediate activity stars like ǫ Eri and
ξ Boo A are nicely explained by the stellar surfaces being completely ﬁlled with solar-like ARs. The EMh values are
very linear for log T < 6.6, so we can assume EMh(T ) ∝ T β and measure the slope, β. For the stellar EMs with
log FX = 5.5 − 6.5 we ﬁnd a mean slope of β = 2.50, in excellent agreement with the solar AR slope of β = 2.41. The
EM seems to start increasing again for log FX > 7.0, but there are only a few stars in this high activity regime, so the
reality of this increase is questionable.

For the solar AR distribution, EMh drops precipitously for log T > 6.6. It is therefore clear that while solar-like
ARs may explain the stellar EMh for log T < 6.6, they cannot account for the high temperature EMh at log T > 6.6,
which becomes quite strong for stars with log FX > 5.5. For this emission, the only solar analog would be solar ﬂares,
as represented by the FL distribution in Figure 10. Simply adding the AR and FL distributions represents a decent
approximation of the stellar distributions corresponding to log FX ∼ 6.0, suggesting that such stars are completely
covered with solar-like ARs, but also have the equivalent of a single X-class ﬂare’s worth of high temperature emission
occurring at all times. Recalling the 0.3% surface coverage of individual solar ﬂares noted above, it is worth noting
that completely covering the surface of a star with X-class ﬂares would lead to a reasonably accurate representation
of the EM distributions of the highest activity stars in our sample, with log FX ∼ 7.5.

Coronal density measurements provide support for the log T ∼ 7.0 emission being fundamentally diﬀerent from the
cooler AR-like emission at log T ∼ 6.5. Analyses of density-sensitive line ratios generally ﬁnd electron densities (in
units of cm−3) of log ne ∼ 10 for log T < 6.6, consistent with typical solar AR densities. However, much higher
densities of log ne ∼ 12 − 13 are generally observed at log T ∼ 7 (Maggio et al. 2004; Testa et al. 2004; Osten et al.
2006; Liefke et al. 2008).

It is worth looking for abundance signatures that might also indicate a distinction between the log T ∼ 6.5 and
log T ∼ 7.0 plasma. Unlike the quiescent solar corona, solar ﬂares generally do not exhibit a FIP eﬀect. This is
demonstrably the case for the 21 SDO/EVE solar ﬂares we have used to deﬁne the FL distribution in Figure 10,
which have roughly photospheric abundances (Warren 2014). However, it is very hard for us to look for a FIP eﬀect
speciﬁcally at log T ∼ 7.0, because the only high-FIP line we have that is at least nominally formed at log T > 6.6 is
Ne X. This is illustrated best by Figure 3, which does not suggest dramatic diﬀerences in FIP bias at Ne X temperatures
compared to lower temperatures. However, even Ne X is problematic, because the contribution function for this species
is quite broad in temperature, meaning that if EMV is higher at log T = 6.5 than at the nominal peak at log T ≈ 6.9
by as little as a factor of 3 or 4, then much of the Ne X emission will actually be coming from log T ≈ 6.5. Most of
our stellar EM distributions do in fact peak near log T = 6.5.

8. EXOPLANET EFFECTS ON CORONAL ABUNDANCES

Ever since the ﬁrst detection of “hot Jupiters” orbiting very close to their host stars, there has been the question
of what eﬀects this close proximity will have on both the planet and star. There is no doubt that the planet’s
characteristics will be greatly aﬀected by being so close to the star. Its temperature will be blisteringly hot, and its

atmosphere will be exposed to extremely high ﬂuxes of both radiation and stellar wind.

More surprising is the notion that the close-in planet might actually aﬀect the star as well, particularly its atmospheric
activity. This is possible in principle through tidal or magnetospheric interactions (Cuntz et al. 2000; Cohen et al.
2009). Several cases have been reported of chromospheric variability with periods commensurate with that of the
planet (Shkolnik et al. 2008; Walker et al. 2008), but these must be balanced against more numerous examples of
nondetections (Shkolnik et al. 2005; Poppenhaeger et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2012; Scandariato et al. 2013). There have
been claims of enhanced activity in planetary host stars in general (Kashyap et al 2008; Scharf 2010), but such cor-
relations may just be a spurious consequence of selection eﬀects (Poppenhaeger & Schmitt 2011; Canto Martins et al.
2011).

Focusing on particularly close-in, massive exoplanet cases where tidal eﬀects are most likely to be present,
Poppenhaeger & Wolk (2014) ﬁnd at least a couple cases where an exoplanet host’s activity level is anomalously
high compared to a distant stellar companion, suggesting that perhaps tidal eﬀect from the exoplanet are keeping the
stellar host spun-up and more active than the companion star. These two cases are HD 189733A and CoRoT-2A, which
host hot Jupiters with Porb = 2.22 day and Porb = 1.74 day, respectively. However, there are also cases where the
exoplanet seems to be inhibiting stellar activity. The WASP-18 system seems to be such a case, with Porb = 0.96 days
and with stellar X-ray and UV emission both anomalously low (Pillitteri et al. 2014b; Fossati et al. 2018). For systems
such as this, tidal eﬀects of the planet may actually be adversely aﬀecting the stellar dynamo.

One of the examples of a planet aﬀecting a stellar atmosphere involves τ Boo A, which is one of the stars in our
sample. As noted in Section 2, τ Boo A has an M2 V stellar companion, τ Boo B. The binary is shown explicitly in
the zeroth-order LETGS image in Figure 12(a). We measure a position angle and stellar separation of θ = 79.2 ± 0.7◦
and ρ = 1.545 ± 0.019′′, respectively. According to the zeroth order image, τ Boo B accounts for only about 21% of

26

the binary’s total X-ray emission. The planetary companion of τ Boo A, τ Boo b, has an orbital period and mass
of Porb = 3.31 days and m sin i = 3.9 MJ , respectively (Butler et al. 1997). The orbital period is about the same as
the stellar rotation period, so this is a case where tidal synchronization may have taken place (Donati et al. 2008).
Shkolnik et al. (2008) and Walker et al. (2008) ﬁnd evidence that τ Boo b can induce an active region on its star
that leads the planet by ∼ 70◦ in longitude, though the active region may come and go with time. The star is also
notable for having a remarkably short activity cycle of 120 days, with detected polarity reversals (Mengel et al. 2016;
Mittag et al. 2017; Jeﬀers et al. 2018). Our goal in this section is to look for evidence that τ Boo A is diﬀerent from
other stars in our sample in ways that can be interpreted as being an eﬀect of the exoplanet.

Starting with the EM measurements, there is no indication that τ Boo A’s EM’s in Figure 9 (at log FX = 5.64)
are systematically discrepant from the other stars. Thus, we conclude that there is no evidence that the exoplanet is
aﬀecting the coronal temperature distribution, which looks normal for a star of this activity level. Coronal abundances
are a diﬀerent story, however. We have already noted that τ Boo A looks modestly discrepant in the relative abundance
plots in Figure 7(a-b), and more convincingly discrepant in the absolute abundance plot in Figure 7(c).

This discrepancy was previously noted by Maggio et al. (2011) and Peretz et al. (2015) based on an XMM spectrum
from 2003 June 24, though those authors were looking for evidence of changes in coronal abundance behavior induced
by high photospheric metallicity, rather than changes that might be induced by τ Boo A’s exoplanet. One advantage
of the Chandra spectrum analyzed here is that the τ Boo AB binary is resolved by Chandra, unlike XMM, meaning
our τ Boo A spectrum is uncontaminated by any emission from the M2 V companion τ Boo B. This is demonstrated
explicitly in Figure 12(a). Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that the EM distribution and abundances that we measure for τ Boo A
agree very well with those reported by Maggio et al. (2011), suggesting that τ Boo B is too faint to have signiﬁcantly
aﬀected analysis of the XMM data. In fact, direct comparison of the Chandra and XMM spectra shows only very
subtle diﬀerences, demonstrating that Chandra/LETGS and XMM have impressively consistent ﬂux calibrations, and
also that τ Boo A does not vary much between the XMM observation in 2003 and the Chandra observation in 2017.
If planets can aﬀect stellar coronae, it would be natural to suppose that the eﬀects might be greatest on the region
of the star closest to the planet. Thus, coronal properties might be expected to be vary with planetary orbital phase.
The Chandra observations were fortuitously split into three pieces (see Table 2), which sample diﬀerent orbital phases.
Figure 12(b) shows the light curves of both τ Boo A and B measured from these separate exposures, based on the
zeroth-order images. Using the ephemeris quoted by Catala et al. (2007) and Mengel et al. (2016), observation IDs
17715, 20019, and 20020 cover orbital phases φ = 0.69 − 0.86, φ = 0.21 − 0.31, and φ = 0.44 − 0.49, respectively, and
Figure 12(c) schematically shows the orbital geometry corresponding to these phases. The φ = 0 phase corresponds
to the ﬁrst conjunction, when the planet is most behind the star from our perspective, with the planetary orbit tilted
by i = 44.5 ± 1.5◦ from the plane of the sky (Brogi et al. 2012). The light curves in Figure 12(b) and the spectra of
the three individual exposures reveal no clear variation with orbital phase. Furthermore, the 2003 XMM observations
were taken at yet another distinct orbital phase of φ = 0.89 − 1.13 (Maggio et al. 2011), and we have already noted
the lack of signiﬁcant variation between the XMM and Chandra/LETGS spectra.

We conclude that if the coronal abundance anomalies for τ Boo A apparent in Figure 7 are in fact due to the planet,
the planet must be aﬀecting the corona globally and not locally. This raises the question as to how an active region on
τ Boo A would continue to be aﬀected by a planet that has orbited behind the star. However, solar observations suggest
that this may be possible in principle. In solar ARs, the FIP bias is observed to evolve on timescales comparable to
τ Boo b’s orbital timescale. In particular, newly emerged solar ARs are generally found to have no FIP eﬀect, and
only acquire the normal solar FIP bias after a couple days (Widing & Feldman 2001). Therefore, one interpretation of
τ Boo A’s reduced FIP bias is that the repetitive perturbations of the exoplanet, with Porb = 3.31 days, somehow reset
the clock on the stellar ARs, making old ARs behave like young ones. Exactly how this might happen is a mystery. Is
it the planet’s gravitational or magnetospheric perturbations that are the most important?

Demonstrating that τ Boo A’s exoplanet is truly the cause of its coronal abundance anomalies requires ﬁnding
examples of this eﬀect for other exoplanet host stars. We take a ﬁrst step in this direction using XMM measurements
of O VIII and Fe XVII lines from another exoplanet host star, HD 189733A (K1.5 V), made by Pillitteri et al.
(2014a). The transiting planetary companion of this star, HD 189733b, has an orbital period and semimajor axis
of only Porb = 2.22 days and a = 0.031 au, respectively, so this is another very close-in exoplanet system where
tidal eﬀects may be important. As mentioned above, HD 189733A is one of the two stars that Poppenhaeger & Wolk
(2014) found to be more active than it should be compared to its stellar companion’s activity level, suggesting that
HD 189733b’s presence may be leading to enhanced activity on HD 189733A. Using the density-sensitive O VII lines
near 22 ˚A, Pillitteri et al. (2014a) report a potentially anomalous high coronal density of ne = (3 − 10) × 1010 cm−3
for HD 189733A, with 1σ error bounds. The best constraints on these lines for τ Boo A would be from the XMM

27

measurements of Maggio et al. (2011) rather than our LETGS measurements. These line ﬂuxes are not suggestive of
high densities, although only a 1σ upper limit of ne < 3 × 1010 cm−3 can be quoted.

Wood et al. (2012) derived a relation between Fbias and the Fe XVII/O VIII ﬂux ratio using the Fe XVII lines at
15 − 17 ˚A and the O VIII line at 19.0 ˚A. Based on this relation and the line ﬂuxes from Pillitteri et al. (2014a), we
estimate Fbias = 0.16 for HD 189733A. However, we have to include the +0.084 correction factor discussed in Section 5,
so our ﬁnal value, with 1σ uncertainty, is Fbias = 0.24 ± 0.22. In Figure 12(d), the FBST relation from Figure 7(b)
is reproduced, and the locations of τ Boo A and HD 189733A are also shown. Both exoplanet host stars lie slightly
above the main sequence star relation. Extremely active stars like EK Dra, AB Dor A, and AU Mic also lie above the
relation (see Figure 7), but neither τ Boo A nor HD 189733A are in this high-activity regime, with X-ray luminosities
of log LX = 28.76 and log LX = 28.46 (Schmitt & Liefke 2004), respectively. Other stars with these luminosities are
consistent with the FBST relation. Thus, we do not believe that high activity accounts for the anomalous coronal
abundances of τ Boo A nor HD 189733A. Considering that previous observations have also suggested that stellar
activity on these stars is being aﬀected by their exoplanets, it seems reasonable to propose that the anomalously high
Fbias values are also somehow caused by the exoplanet inﬂuence.

9. SUMMARY

We have conducted a survey of all main sequence star Chandra/LETGS spectra with suﬃcient S/N for detailed
analysis. This involves the analysis of 21 spectra from 19 stars, where both low-state and high-state spectra are
considered for α Cen A and B. From these spectra we measure ﬂuxes or upper limits for 118 lines from 49 ionic
species. The EM analyses based on these measurements provide coronal temperature distributions and abundance
measurements, leading to the following conclusions:

1. In contrast to past analyses, we no longer ﬁnd narrow EM peaks at log T = 6.6, though there is still generally
an EM maximum near that temperature, and we also ﬁnd a systematic increase of +0.084 in the “FIP bias”
parameter, Fbias, compared to past measurements. This is due to changes in Fe XVII line emissivities in
version 7.1 of the CHIANTI database, used here as the source for atomic data. In particular, emissivities of
three of the four strong Fe XVII lines at 15 − 17 ˚A increased by ∼ 60% compared to past CHIANTI versions.

2. We expand on previous studies of the FBST relation, supplementing our LETGS sample with other published
results from XMM and HETGS. Consideration of Altair (A7 V) and η Lep (F1 V) allows us to extend the relation
to earlier spectral types than before. We ﬁnd that the relation is ﬂat at A7-G5 spectral types, before increasing
towards later types. Replacing spectral type with Tef f allows us to derive a quantitative FBST relation, which
is provided in equation (5).

3. Absolute coronal Fe abundances are quantiﬁed using a line-to-continuum analysis, focusing on the 25 − 40 ˚A
region. We ﬁnd a roughly linear correlation between [Fe/Fe∗] and Tef f , [Fe/Fe∗] = −1.288 + 2.176 × 10−4 Tef f ,
albeit with a lot of scatter.

4. While the solar and stellar coronal abundances are perfectly consistent with each other with regards to relative
abundances as quantiﬁed by Fbias, such is not the case for absolute abundances. While the solar FIP eﬀect is
generally accepted to involve low-FIP elements being enhanced, the stellar abundance measurements for solar-
like G dwarfs seem more consistent with high-FIP depletions. This discrepancy casts doubt on the reliability of
the line-to-continuum analysis.

5. We measure Ne/O=0.39 for our sample of stars, consistent with previous work (Drake & Testa 2005). We ﬁnd no
indication of activity dependence that might mitigate the discrepancy with the solar value, which is nevertheless
less dramatic than it used to be if the larger solar measurement from Young (2018), Ne/O = 0.24 ± 0.05, is
utilized.

6. Coronal Si/Fe ratios are systematically high for M dwarfs. This may be due to the incorporation of Si into SiO
in M dwarf photospheres. We propose that the robustness of SiO leads to Si behaving more like a high-FIP
element with regards to its coronal abundance.

7. Comparisons are made with the solar full-disk EM distributions from SDO/EVE (Schonfeld et al. 2017). The
corona of α Cen B is the most solar-like in our sample, with a similar EM distribution and X-ray surface ﬂux.

28

8. We ﬁnd no change in coronal abundances between the low-state and high-state spectra of α Cen A and B,

suggesting that coronal abundances do not vary with activity cycles.

9. Our sample of main sequence stars provides a consistent picture for how EM distributions change with increasing
FX , with no evidence for any spectral type dependence. Thus, we derive EM distributions as a function of FX
(see Figure 10 and Table 7), which can be used as the basis for future theoretical studies of coronal heating, and
can also be used to estimate EM distributions for any star with a measured broadband X-ray luminosity.

10. The stellar EM distributions are compared with solar QS, AR, and FL distributions. The QS distribution, with
log FX = 3.61, may represent a minimum emission level for main sequence star coronae. Between log FX = 5.0
and log FX = 6.5, the stellar distributions agree very well with the solar AR distribution for log T < 6.6, in terms
of both magnitude and slope, consistent with the idea that the surfaces of moderately active stars are completely
ﬁlled with solar-like ARs. The sum of the AR and FL distributions represents a reasonable approximation of
the stellar distribution we ﬁnd at log FX ∼ 6.0. Completely covering the surface of a star with the X-class ﬂares
represented by our FL distribution leads to a decent approximation of the observed EM distribution of our most
active stars, with log FX ∼ 7.5.

11. In deriving the solar FL distribution, we also inferred a relation between GOES X-class and X-ray luminosity:

log LX = 0.56 log Xf + 27.75.

12. The coronal abundances of the exoplanet host τ Boo A are anomalous. The Fbias value is somewhat higher
than it should be, and [Fe/Fe∗] is much lower. An Fbias estimate for another exoplanet host, HD 189733A, from
XMM measurements is also somewhat higher than it should be. We therefore conclude that the close-in, massive
exoplanets of these stars may be aﬀecting their coronal abundances.
