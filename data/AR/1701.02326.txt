Abstract. We use very deep spectra obtained with the Ultraviolet-
Visual Echelle Spectrograph in the Very Large Telescope in order to de-
termine the physical conditions, the chemical abundances and depletion
factors of four H ii regions of the Large Magellanic Cloud and four H ii
regions of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The spectral range covered is
3100-10400 ˚A with a resolution of ∆λ ∼ λ/8800. We measure the inten-
sity of up to 200 emission lines in each object. Electron temperature and
electron density are determined using diﬀerent line intensity ratios. The
ionic and total abundances are derived using collisionally excited lines for
O, N, S, Cl, Ne, Ar, and Fe. The uncertainties for all the computations are
calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. This is the largest available set
of high quality spectra for H ii regions in the Magellanic Clouds. Thus, we
can derive chemical abundances and depletion factors and constrain their
variations across each galaxy with better accuracy than previous studies.
In particular, we ﬁnd that the amount of Fe depleted on to dust grains
in the H ii regions of the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that found in
Galactic H ii regions.

Introduction

The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are the laboratories for studies in extragalactic
H ii regions at lower metallicities than in the Milky Way. Deep optical spectra
of H ii regions in these galaxies would allow us to detect and measure relatively
faint iron lines and thus, study the properties of dust in ionized nebulae through
the analysis of the iron depletion factor. This factor is deﬁned as the ratio
between the expected abundance of iron and the one measured in the gas phase.
The study of the dust in ionized nebulae of the MCs will provide clues on the
processes responsible for the formation and evolution of the grains and the role
played by metallicity in the eﬃciency of these processes. Rodríguez & Rubin
(2005) and Delgado-Inglada et al. (2011) found that ionized nebulae with lower

metallicities show lower depletions factors. We extend the sample for H ii regions
in the MCs in order to better understand this behavior.

2. Observational data

We obtained echelle spectra of 8 H ii regions in the MCs, 4 in the Small Mag-
ellanic Cloud (SMC) and 4 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The data
were taken with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) in the Very
Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The spectral range covered was from 3100 ˚A to
10400 ˚A with a spectral resolution of ∆λ ∼ λ/8800. The atmospheric dispersion
corrector was used to keep the same observed region within the slit since the
MCs are observed at relatively high airmass (between 1.35 and 1.88). The slit
position for each object was chosen to have enough spectral resolution and high
signal-to-noise.

The data reduction was performed using the public UVES pipeline under the
gasgano graphic user interface through the standard procedure of bias and
aperture subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding and wavelength calibration. For ﬂux calibra-
tion we used the available tasks in the iraf1 software package using the standard
stars HR718, HR 3454 and HR9087. Figure 1 shows part of the spectrum of N81
where we identify several iron emission lines. Line intensities were measured by
integrating the ﬂux above the continuum deﬁned by two points on each side of
the emission lines. Flux uncertainties were computed by adding quadratically
line ﬂuxes and ﬂux calibration uncertainties. We ﬁnally include the uncertainty
associated to the propagation in the reddening coeﬃcient.

3. Results

The calculations of physical conditions and ionic and total abundances were car-
ried out with PyNeb (Luridiana et al. 2015). The uncertainties were obtained
through Monte Carlo simulations. We determined four diagnostics for electron
density using sulfur, oxygen, chlorine and argon lines. We decided to use the
average electron density only from ne([O ii]) and ne([S ii]) diagnostics since
ne([Cl iii]) and ne([Ar iv]) give higher densities owing to they are less sensitive
at lower densities. We computed electron temperature from ﬁve diﬀerent diag-
nostics: Te([N ii]), Te([O ii]), Te([O iii]), Te([S iii]) and Te([Ar iii]). We decided
to use Te([N ii]) as the representative temperature for the low ionization degree
zone because the emission lines used to determine Te([O ii]) are aﬀected by re-
combination and density variations. For high ionization degree zone we decided
to use Te([O iii]) because some of the emission lines used to determine Te([S iii])
are aﬀected by telluric absorption and Te([Ar iii]) gives higher uncertainties than
Te([O iii]).

Once we determined the physical conditions, we computed the ionic abundances
for all the available ions assuming the two-zone scheme. For oxygen we added
directly O+/H+ and O++/H+ when He II lines are not observed; otherwise we
used the ionization corrector factor (ICF) given by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014).
For nitrogen we used the classical ICF, N/O = N+/O+, as suggested by Delgado-
Inglada et al. (2015). For iron we used the ICFs given by Rodríguez & Rubin
(2005). We used the two ICFs they recommend because they give us extreme
values of the total iron abundance and can be used to constrain the true values of
the Fe abundances in the gas. For the rest of elements we used the ICFs given by
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014). The uncertainties due the ICFs are not considered.

Figure 2 shows the oxygen abundance as a function of the ionization degree for
all the objects (ﬁlled symbols). The squares are H ii regions from the LMC
and the stars are H ii regions from the SMC. We include other objects from the
literature as empty symbols (Tsamis et al. 2003, Nazé et al. 2003 and Peimbert
2003). We can see that the O abundance is higher for the LMC than the SMC
by ∼ 0.38 dex. In Figure 3 we plot the total abundance for the other elements
with respect to oxygen as a function of the ionization degree. The S and Cl
abundances are similar in both clouds within the uncertainties; the same behav-
ior is seen for the Ne abundances. For N abundances it seems to be a separation
between the two MCs due to diﬀerences in the chemical evolution of each galaxy.
For Ar abundances there is a problem with the ICF since there is a trend with
the ionization degree.

Total oxygen abundance as a function of the ionization
degree. The orange squares symbols are H ii regions from the LMC and
the blue stars symbols are H ii regions from the SMC. The ﬁlled symbols
represent our main sample and the empty ones are objects collected
from the literature. The orange and blue dashed lines correspond to
the average of the total oxygen abundance for the LMC and the SMC,
respectively.

Figure 4 shows the values of the the depletion factor for Fe derived with the
two ICFs as a function of the oxygen abundance for all the objects. The colored
symbols are for the ICF from equation (2) and the gray symbols are for the
ICF from equation (3) of Rodriguez & Rubin (2005). We include Galactic H ii
regions (green diamonds), H ii galaxies (purple circles), irregular galaxies (cyan
triangles). We performed the analysis in the same way than for the main sample.
We see that the iron depletions into dust grains in H ii regions of the LMC are
similar to those found in Galactic nebulae in previous works. The SMC also
shows this behavior but in a wider range of iron depletions. Besides, there is
an object: N88A, that follows the trend that H ii with lower metallicities show
lower depletions factors.

4. Conclusions

We present new determinations of chemical abundances of 8 H ii regions in the
MCs, 4 in the LMC and 4 in the SMC, using deep echelle spectra taken at the
VLT. The main conclusions are:

• O/H is higher in the LMC by ∼0.4 dex.
