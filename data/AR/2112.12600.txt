ABSTRACT
We present a reassessment of the radial abundance gradients of He, C, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar in
the Milky Way using the deep optical spectra of 42 H ii regions presented in Arellano-Córdova
et al. (2020, 2021) and Méndez-Delgado et al. (2020) exploring the impact of: (1) new distance
determinations based on Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and (2) the use of Peimbert’s temperature
ﬂuctuations paradigm (𝑡2 > 0) for deriving ionic abundances. We ﬁnd that distances based
on Gaia EDR3 data are more consistent with kinematic ones based on Galactic rotation
curves calibrated with radio parallaxes, which give less dispersion and uncertainties than those
calibrated with spectrophotometric stellar distances. The distances based on the Gaia parallaxes
–DR2 or EDR3– eliminate the internal ﬂattening observed in previous determinations of the
Galactic gradients at smaller distances than ∼ 7 kpc. Abundances and gradients determined
assuming 𝑡2 > 0 —not only for O but also for the rest of elements— are not aﬀected by the
abundance discrepancy problem and give elemental abundances much consistent with the solar
ones for most elements. We ﬁnd that our radial abundance gradient of He is consistent with the
most accurate estimates of the primordial He abundance. We do not ﬁnd evidence of azimuthal
variations in the chemical abundances of our sample. Moreover, the small dispersion in the O
gradient —indicator of metallicity in photoionized regions— indicate that the gas of the H ii
regions is well mixed in the sampled areas of the Galaxy.

Key words: Stars: distances–ISM: abundances–Galaxy: abundances–Galaxy: disc–Galaxy:

INTRODUCTION

Chemical evolution models of galaxies require precise observational
constraints as the determinations of abundance gradients. In order
to obtain good determinations of these gradients, it is necessary
to have accurate radial distances and precise determinations of the
chemical abundances. In the Milky Way, the determination of the
Galactocentric distances is particularly problematic, since both the
Sun and the observed nebulae are placed within the Galactic disk.
Although it is common for Galactic abundance gradient studies
to focus mainly on the determination of chemical abundances, in
this paper we will emphasize the eﬀects of using the more precise
distance determinations.

Distances to Galactic H ii regions can be determined using

diﬀerent techniques. Some of the most common methodologies are
based on the study of radial velocities of the nebulae or photom-
etry of their associated stars (see e. g. Caplan et al. 2000; Russeil
2003; Quireza et al. 2006; Russeil et al. 2007; Balser et al. 2011;
Moisés et al. 2011; Foster & Brunt 2015; Anderson et al. 2015;
Wenger et al. 2018, and references therein). However, their results
are strongly dependent on the rotation and extinction models of
the Galaxy, which are still matter of debate. This problem can be
avoided by using direct parallax-based distance determinations of
their stellar populations (e. g. Menten et al. 2007; Kraus et al. 2007;
Hirota et al. 2007; Bartkiewicz et al. 2008; Reid et al. 2009; Brun-
thaler et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2009, and references
therein). However, until a few years ago, there were not enough
reliable parallax measurements. Since the availability of the optical
parallaxes from the Second Data Release of Gaia (hereinafter Gaia
DR2, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) there are billions of reliable

optical stellar parallaxes, from which distance can be determined
directly. Moreover, in the recent Gaia Early Data Release 3 (here-
inafter EDR3, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021), these parallaxes have
substantially improved their precision.

Regarding the determination of chemical abundances of H ii
regions, there is a signiﬁcant source of uncertainty due to the Abun-
dance Discrepancy (AD) problem, which is the systematic diﬀer-
ence between the derived abundances based on the intensity of
collisionally excited lines (CELs) and recombination lines (RLs),
where the RLs give always higher abundances. The origin of this
problem is still not clear. However, García-Rojas & Esteban (2007)
showed that the Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF)1 is rather
constant for O2+ in Galactic H ii regions –presenting a diﬀerent
behavior from what is observed in planetary nebulae–, being con-
sistent with the predictions of the temperature ﬂuctuations paradigm
proposed by Peimbert (1967).

In this work, we derive the Galactic radial abundance gradients
of He, C, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar based on the 42 Galactic H ii
regions studied by Méndez-Delgado et al. (2020) and Arellano-
Córdova et al. (2020, 2021). We analyze the distances based on
the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and the probabilistic approach of Bailer-
Jones et al. (2021) and derive the chemical composition assuming
the temperature ﬂuctuations (𝑡2 > 0) paradigm (Peimbert 1967).

In Sec. 2 we describe the sample of spectra adopted from the
literature. In Sec. 3, we analyze the distances to the Galactic H ii
regions of our sample using the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, as well as
the kinematic distance determinations. In Sec. 4, we analyze the
determination of chemical abundances in the Galactic H ii regions
of our sample under the paradigm of temperature ﬂuctuations –
𝑡2 > 0 – as well as the resulting chemical abundance gradients. In
Sec. 5 we discuss our results and summarize them in Sec. 6. In the
Appendix we include some data tables and ﬁgures.

2 OBSERVATIONAL SAMPLE

The spectra of the 42 Galactic H ii regions used in this paper are
of high and intermediate spectral resolution, taken with diﬀerent
telescopes with diameters ranging from 4 m to 10 m. The ob-
jects which spectra are published in Esteban et al. (2004, 2013)
and García-Rojas et al. (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007)2 were observed
with the UT2 (Kueyen) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using
the Ultraviolet–Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), covering the
spectral range from 3570 to 10,400 Å and with 𝑅 ∼ 8000. The spec-
tra of the H ii regions observed by Esteban et al. (2017); Esteban &
García-Rojas (2018) and Arellano-Córdova et al. (2021) were taken
with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) using OSIRIS
(Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Inte-
grated Spectroscopy) spectrograph in longslit mode, covering from
3600 to 7750 Å with 𝑅 ∼ 1000 or 2500. The spectra of three H ii
regions were observed by García-Rojas et al. (2014) or Fernández-
Martín et al. (2017) with the Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph
and Imaging System (ISIS) attached to the 4.2 m William Herschel
Telescope (WHT), the spectral coverage was from 3600 to 9200 Å
or 3200 to 10,000 Å with 𝑅 ∼ 1000. In addition, we have included
17 Galactic H ii regions and ring nebulae around massive stars for
the distance analysis but not in the abundance one. This is because

CELs.

published.

we do not have the emission line ratios of their spectra available or,
in the case of ring nebulae, their He, O, and N abundances may be
polluted by stellar ejecta.

3 REVISING THE DISTANCES OF A SAMPLE OF
GALACTIC H II REGIONS WITH GAIA EDR3

We conduct an extensive literature search on ionizing sources of our
sample of Galactic H ii regions in order to determine their distances.
The ionizing stars are expected to be O, early B or Wolf-Rayet-type
stars, so they should be among the most luminous stars contained
in the boundaries or immediate surroundings of the H ii regions.
In addition, their parallax should be more precise than those of the
rest of their associated stellar population. However, some of these
stars may be located in dusty environments or belong to multiple
systems that may be not well spatially resolved. In these cases, we
look for other stars or young stellar objects (YSOs) that belong to
the H ii region, even if they are not their ionizing sources.

After ﬁnding the stars contained in the nebulae, we locate them
in the Gaia DR2 and EDR3 catalogs using their coordinates, to ﬁ-
nally obtain their parallax-based distances (Bailer-Jones et al. 2018,
2021). Besides the parallaxes, the Gaia EDR3 data contain color
and magnitude measurements, allowing to estimate photometric
distances. Taking advantage of this, Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), have
estimated the distance to the stars using two methods, obtaining
the so-called geometric and photogeometric distances. Geometric
distances are estimated from the parallaxes, considering the non-
linearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the probability
distribution through a prior parameter that varies smoothly as a
function of Galactic longitude and latitude, independently of as-
sumptions of stellar physics or interstellar extinction. Geometric
distances were also calculated with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes in
Bailer-Jones et al. (2018). The photogeometric distances, mean-
while, use the same distance prior, in addition to a color-magnitude
one based on a model of the Galactic interstellar extinction.

In Table A1 we present the identiﬁed ionizing/associated stars
in each nebula, as well as their spectral type, the Gaia DR2 ID,
heliocentric geometric distances derived from their parallaxes in
the Gaia DR2 and EDR3 data (Bailer-Jones et al. 2018, 2021)
and the references to the identiﬁcation of ionizing/associated stars
(I/A) and spectral type (SpT). For each distance determination,
we specify the uncertainty associated with the parallax. In general,
these uncertainties decrease considerably between the Gaia DR2 and
Gaia EDR3 data except in two cases: the stars MFJ SH 2-212 2 and
HD 253327, associated with the H ii regions Sh 2-212 and Sh 2-257,
respectively. In both stars, the EDR3 parallax is noticeably worse
than the DR2 one and give very diﬀerent distances. Moﬀat et al.
(1979) cataloged 14 possible ionizing stars in Sh 2-212. However,
Deharveng et al. (2008) showed that several of these sources are
evolved stars that may not belong to the same star cluster. Moﬀat
et al. (1979) and Deharveng et al. (2008) agree that the main ionizing
star of the region is MFJ SH 2-212 2, which has the most uncertain
parallax. However, the conﬁrmed membership of MFJ SH 2-212 5,
MFJ SH 2-212 7 and MFJ SH 2-212 11 to the same stellar group as
MFJ SH 2-212 2 allow us to estimate the distance to Sh 2-212 with
a high conﬁdence. The odd value of the parallax of MFJ SH 2-212 2
does not seem to be related to the presence of dust in the center of
Sh 2-212 since most of its optical extinction is of interstellar origin
(Deharveng et al. 2008). It is more likely that the discrepant parallax
is due to MFJ SH 2-212 2 being a binary or multiple system. This
is suggested by its renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) value

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2021)

of 8.48, which is larger than the expected threshold of 1.4 for single
stars (Fabricius et al. 2021).

The Gaia parallax of HD 253327 (in Sh 2-257) is also very
diﬀerent when comparing DR2 and EDR3 data. Ojha et al. (2011)
showed that Sh 2-255 and Sh 2-257 are associated with the same
gas complex and therefore they are at the same distance. The lower
uncertainty of the EDR3 parallax of the ionizing star of Sh 2-
255, LS 19, indicates that its distance is the most suitable one for
HD 253327. In this case, the RUWE value of 1.209 does not point to
HD 253327 being a binary or multiple system (although it does not
rule it out). Additionally, the similar optical extinction coeﬃcients
of Sh 2-255 and Sh 2-257 (see Table 7 from Shaver et al. (1983a))
seems to rule out dust extinction as the cause of the problem. There
are several ionizing stars for some nebulae included in Table A1. If
the distance obtained for each ionizing source is consistent, we take
the more precise individual parallax as the representative one for the
nebula. In the cases of NGC 3603, M 16, M 17 and M 42, we adopt
the distances derived by Drew et al. (2019) and Binder & Povich
(2018) which are based on the analysis of the Gaia DR2 parallaxes
of multiple stars associated with the photoionized regions. The use
of several stars diminishes the statistical errors, reaching a higher
precision in the distance estimates.

A large fraction of the sample of stars analyzed in this work has
Gaia EDR3 parallaxes with uncertainties smaller than 10 per cent
(𝑒plx/plx < 0.10), enabling us to make a reliable estimate of the dis-
tance directly from inverting the parallax (Bailer-Jones et al. 2021).
In Gaia DR2, quasars observations indicate a global zeropoint bias
in the parallax measurements of about −0.03 mas, with variations
dependent on magnitude, color and position of the stars (Lindegren
et al. 2018). For Gaia EDR3, Lindegren et al. (2021b,a) provide
a tentative expression for a better correction of the zeropoint bias
including its non-trivial dependence on the ecliptic latitude, mag-
nitude and color. For our sub-sample with the best parallaxes (with
uncertainties smaller than 10 per cent), this zeropoint varies from
−0.055 mas to −0.011 mas, although the median is −0.030 mas with
1𝜎 deviation of 0.010 mas. This indicates that the deviation from
a constant value is rather small, minimizing the dependence of the
distance with the zeropoint correction and the variables on which
it depends. From the Gaia EDR3 data we can have up to 3 distance
estimates for the same star which will be analyzed in Sec. 3.1, along
with some relevant kinematic distance estimates.

3.1 Galactocentric Distances

We adopt a solar Galactocentric distance of 𝑅0 = 8.2 ± 0.1 kpc to
estimate the Galactocentric distances of the nebulae from the helio-
centric parallax-based ones. That value of 𝑅0 is the best estimate
to the overall distribution of 26 recent values with tracers in the
Galactic centre, bulge, disc and halo (Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard
2016), and it is very close to the geometric distance to the Galactic
centre black hole estimated by Gravity Collaboration et al. (2019) of
𝑅0 = 8.178 ± 0.013(stat) ± 0.022(sys) kpc, where stat and sys stands
for the contribution of statistical and systematic uncertainties, re-
spectively. This same value was adopted by Méndez-Delgado et al.
(2020), Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020, 2021), so the comparison
with results of those papers is straightforward.

In Table A2 we compare our parallax-based estimates of Galac-
tocentric distances with the kinematic determinations of Russeil
(2003); Russeil et al. (2007) and Wenger et al. (2019) in the nebulae
in common. Although there is a large number of articles devoted to
the estimation of kinematic distances, the ones of Russeil (2003) and
Russeil et al. (2007) are representative of the usual method based on

the Brand & Blitz (1993) rotation curve, calibrated through the ob-
servation of around 400 Galactic H ii regions with spectrophotomet-
ric distances to their associated stars (Brand & Wouterloot 1988),
and the IAU-deﬁned solar motion parameters3 (Kerr & Lynden-Bell
1986). On the other hand, the kinematic determinations of Wenger
et al. (2019) are based on a Monte Carlo technique adapted to the
more recent rotation curve of Reid et al. (2014), which was cal-
ibrated with around 100 parallax-distances from masers observed
at radio wavelengths, with updated solar parameters4 (although the
sample has been expanded to ≈ 200 regions in Reid et al. 2019).
The results of this method generally present smaller uncertainties
than the direct use of the rotation curve of Reid et al. (2014) (Wenger
et al. 2018).

In Fig. A1 we show the comparison between the Gaia EDR3
geometric Galactocentric distances and other estimates obtained
from Gaia Parallaxes. In the top panel, the consistency with the
geometric Gaia DR2 distance is remarkable, besides the reduction
of the uncertainties in the EDR3 values. The middle panel shows
that the photogeometric values are practically the same than the
geometric ones for the whole sample, with the exception of Sh 2-
127, where the diﬀerence is appreciable, although both estimates
are consistent within the error bars. In the more distant regions, the
uncertainties in the photogeometric distances are slightly smaller
due to the use of more information about the stars. However, all
the objects we analyze in this paper are located at almost zero
Galactic latitudes, which makes the correction for extinction less
accurate (Bailer-Jones et al. 2021). Therefore, there is little reward
on adopting the photogeometric distances in some particular cases,
while it seems more reasonable to use the geometric EDR3 ones
in the whole sample as the representative parallax-based distances.
The bottom panel shows the consistency between the geometric
EDR3 Galactocentric distances and those simply calculated as the
inverse of the parallax for the sub-sample with parallax uncertainties
smaller than 10 per cent.

Fig. A2 shows a comparison between the geometric Gaia EDR3
Galactocentric distances and the kinematic estimations by Russeil
(2003), Russeil et al. (2007) and Wenger et al. (2019). Besides the
adoption of diﬀerent solar parameters, the main diﬀerence between
both kinematic estimates is in the Galactic rotation curve used. As
we can see in Fig. A2, at Galactocentric distances < 13 kpc, the
kinematic determinations from Russeil (2003) and Russeil et al.
(2007) show a moderate good agreement with our estimates based
on Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, although there is a slight overestimation
of the kinematic distances due to the larger solar 𝑅0 adopted. More
important is the underestimation of the kinematic distances in a
group of regions with 𝑅𝐺 between 5 and 7 kpc, which includes
Sh 2-29, Sh 2-32, M 8 and M 20. Finally, at distances greater than
≈ 13 kpc, the kinematic distances from Russeil (2003) and Russeil
et al. (2007), seem to be signiﬁcantly overestimated for most objects.
The bottom panel of Fig. A2 shows that the kinematic distances
from Wenger et al. (2019) are in fairly good agreement with our
determinations. Although there is debate about which rotation curve
of the Milky Way is the most appropriate (see Russeil et al. 2017),
in our case, the one proposed by Reid et al. (2014) gives more
consistent results. However, it should be kept in mind that our sample

of Galactic H ii regions and ring nebulae is quite limited and only
covers two quadrants of the Galactic disc.

Considering observational evidences, we deﬁne the following
criteria to adopt the representative distances of our sample of Galac-
tic nebulae: (i) we adopt the EDR3 geometric distance when the
uncertainties of the parallax are smaller than 20 per cent; (ii) when
(i) is not satisﬁed, we adopt the kinematic distances of Wenger et al.
(2019) if their uncertainties are smaller than 20 per cent; (iii) when
criteria (i) and (ii) cannot be satisﬁed (the only case is Sh 2-48),
we adopt the EDR3 geometric distance, however, it must be used
with caution since its uncertainty is relatively high. Exceptions to
the aforementioned procedure are Sh 2-209 and Sh 2-270, and both
cases will be discussed in Sec. 3.2. Table 1 presents the adopted he-
liocentric and Galactocentric distances for our sample of Galactic
nebula while Fig. 1 shows their Galactic distribution.

In Fig. 2 we show the comparison between the values adopted
by Méndez-Delgado et al. (2020) and Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020,
2021) and our updated values given in Table 1. In general, there
is a good agreement between both sets of distances. In Méndez-
Delgado et al. (2020) and Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020, 2021), the

Gaia DR2 parallaxes. In those cases, the adopted distance was the
average of diﬀerent kinematic and spectrophotometric estimates.
However, most of the kinematic distances used in the calculation
of the aforementioned average were based on the rotation curve
of Brand & Blitz (1993), which, as shown in Fig. A2, seems to
overestimate the distance of the objects located at Galactocentric
distances (cid:38) 13 kpc, which explains the larger previous distance
determinations of several nebula located between ≈ 13 and ≈ 14
kpc shown in Fig. 2.

3.2 On the distances of Sh 2-209 and Sh 2-270

From our sample of Galactic H ii regions, only Sh 2-209 and
Sh 2-270 show diﬀerences between parallax-based and kine-
matic/spectrophotometric distances that can not be explained by
methodological issues. The Galactocentric distances adopted in
Esteban et al. (2017) and Esteban & García-Rojas (2018) are
𝑅𝐺 = 17.00 ± 0.70 kpc and 𝑅𝐺 = 16.10 ± 1.40 kpc for Sh 2-209
and Sh 2-270, respectively, but the parallax-based distances derived
from Gaia EDR3 are only about 65 per cent of those values (see Ta-
ble A2). Sh 2-209 and Sh 2-270 were precisely among the objects
which stars have very uncertain Gaia DR2 parallaxes and for which
Esteban et al. (2017) and Esteban & García-Rojas (2018) adopted
the average value of several spectrophotometric and/or kinematic
distances, as commented at the end of the previous section. If we
assume that the Gaia EDR3 parallax-based distances are the true
ones for these regions, Sh 2-209 would be located only at 0.36 kpc
from Sh 2-206 in the Galactic plane (both nebulae are less than
one degree apart). There are several determinations of the Galactic
rotation velocity of Sh 2-209 in the local standard of rest (Brand &
Blitz 1993; Caplan et al. 2000; Russeil 2003; Balser et al. 2011), all
being consistent with the most precise one by Balser et al. (2011)
of 𝑉lsr = −51.18 ± 0.09 km s−1. The same occurs with Sh 2-206,
where Balser et al. (2011) determined 𝑉lsr = −26.61 ± 0.05 km s−1.
These numbers imply a ratio of 1.92 between the Galactic rotation
velocity of Sh 2-209 with respect to that of Sh 2-206, which is en-
tirely inconsistent for two neighbor objects located at very similar
Galactocentric distance.

In the case of Sh 2-270, if we assume the Gaia EDR3 parallax-
based distance as the true one, this region would be only 0.22 kpc
apart from Sh 2-255 and Sh 2-257. Balser et al. (2011) estimated
a 𝑉lsr = −5.05 ± 0.09 km s−1 for Sh 2-257 (which is located at
the same distance as Sh 2-255), while Russeil (2003) reported a
𝑉lsr = 25.6 km s−1 for Sh 2-270. However, the three objects are in
the general direction of the Galactic anticentre and such velocity
diﬀerence is not conclusive.

Foster & Brunt (2015) performed a spectrophotometrical
analysis of the ionizing/associated stars of Sh 2-209 and Sh 2-
270 included in Table A1. From their distance modulus, they
found heliocentric distances of 𝑑 = 10.58 ± 0.57 km s−1 and
𝑑 = 9.27 ± 1.85 km s−1 for Sh 2-209 and Sh 2-270, respectively,
which are consistent with the distances adopted by Esteban et al.
(2017) and Esteban & García-Rojas (2018). This rejects the misiden-
tiﬁcation of the ionizing/associated stars as the cause of the discrep-
ancy in the distances of these objects and points out to possible
errors in the reported Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. Although these errors
are rather rare, there are cases – as MFJ SH 2-212 2 and HD 253327,
commented before – where the Gaia DR2 and EDR3 parallaxes can
diﬀer beyond the formal uncertainty bars.

As a result of this discussion, we adopt the distances reported
by Esteban et al. (2017) and Esteban & García-Rojas (2018) for

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2021)

Sh 2-209 and Sh 2-270, both having convenient conservative error
bars. Improved optical or radio parallaxes for the stars associated
with these nebulae would help to solve the distance inconsistencies.

4 EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS ON

THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES

Peimbert (1967) introduced the concept and the formalism of the
paradigm of temperature ﬂuctuations in gaseous nebulae. In his
eqs. (9) and (12), he deﬁnes the average temperature (𝑇0) and the
root mean square temperature ﬂuctuation parameter (𝑡2), that ac-
counts for the level of inhomogeneities or ﬂuctuations in the spatial
distribution of the electron temperature within the observed vol-
ume. According to this paradigm, when we estimate the electron
temperature from an auroral-nebular ratio of CELs – as [O iii]
I(𝜆4363)/I(𝜆5007) –, the resulting value will be conditioned to 𝑡2.
The derived temperature will favor the hottest areas within the line
of sight and consequently, ionic abundance determinations based
on CELs will be underestimated.

On the other hand, the intensity ratios of RLs have a very
slight dependence on temperature and the impact of temperature
ﬂuctuations is practically negligible. Because of this, it is possible
that temperature inhomogeneities could cause or contribute to the
AD problem, making abundances based on CELs systematically
underestimated, while those of RLs are not.

As mentioned in Sec. 1, García-Rojas & Esteban (2007) con-
clude that for M 8, M 16, M 17, M 20, M 42, NGC 3576, NGC 3603
and Sh 2-311, the ADF(O2+) is rather constant around a factor of
2 and consistent with the temperature ﬂuctuations paradigm. How-
ever, the ADF of other ions, such as O+, does not have to be the
same as ADF(O2+). In fact, if there is a global value of 𝑡2 > 0 in a
given nebula, this will aﬀect diﬀerently to each ion, depending on
the excitation energies of the upper levels of their observed CELs
as shown in eq. (11) from Peimbert et al. (2004). Therefore, con-
sidering a constant ADF on all ions is diﬀerent from considering a
global constant 𝑡2.

There are several methods to estimate 𝑇0 and 𝑡2. It is possible
to calculate them by comparing diﬀerent temperature diagnostics
of the gas that belongs to the same volume. It is also common to
determine them from the ADF, although this procedure assumes
that temperature ﬂuctuations are the cause of the AD problem.
From our sample, M 8, M 16, M 17, M 20, M 42, NGC 2579,
NGC 3576, NGC 3603 and Sh 2-311 have deep high spectral-
resolution spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope (VLT),
with reliable estimates of 𝑡2. Fig. 3 shows that the radial distribution
of 𝑡2 in the aforementioned sample of H ii regions along the Galactic
disc seems to be rather ﬂat, at least at 𝑅𝐺 values between 6.45 and
11.6 kpc. Therefore, it seems reasonable to adopt a weighted average
of 𝑡2 = 0.038 ± 0.004 as a representative-𝑡2 value for the Galactic
H ii regions. We must say that although its uncertainty of 𝑡2 is the
smallest of the whole sample, the Orion Nebula has been eliminated
in the calculation of the weighted average. This is because the Orion
Nebula shows the lowest value, by far, of 𝑡2. Considering it to
calculate the weighted mean we obtain 𝑡2 = 0.029 ± 0.008. A value
that does not seem to represent properly the rest of the H ii regions
included in Fig. 3. In any case, if included, both determinations of
the weighted average of 𝑡2 are consistent within the 1𝜎 error bars.
The conclusions of the paper are not altered nor do they depend on
the inclusion or exclusion of this point.

4.1

Ionic and total abundances

We use eq. (15) from Peimbert (1967) as well as eq. (8), eq. (9) and
eq. (11) from Peimbert et al. (2004) to calculate the impact of assum-
ing 𝑡2 = 0.038 ± 0.004 in the ionic abundances. In this process, we
also use the excitation energies of the atomic levels associated with
each corresponding emission line, together with the physical con-
ditions and the ionic abundances determined by Arellano-Córdova
et al. (2020, 2021) assuming 𝑡2 = 0. In these previous works, the
electron density (𝑛e) was obtained using the [O ii] 𝜆3729/𝜆3726,
[S ii] 𝜆6717/𝜆6731 and/or [Cl iii] 𝜆5518/𝜆5538 line intensity ratios
(although the [Cl iii] diagnostic was discarded if it led to large un-
certainties). For cases where the derived 𝑛e was too low (𝑛e < 100
cm−3), a value of 100 cm−3 was adopted. On the other hand, the
electronic temperatures (𝑇e) were derived using a low- and high-
ionization zones scheme, using the [N ii] (𝜆6548+𝜆6584)/𝜆5755
(𝑇e([N ii])) and the [O iii] (𝜆4959+𝜆5007)/𝜆4363 (𝑇e([O iii])) line
intensity ratios, respectively. The temperature relation proposed by
Esteban et al. (2009) was used to derive either 𝑇e([N ii]) or 𝑇e([O iii])
when [O ii] 𝜆4363 or [N ii] 𝜆5755 was not detected. The result-
ing ionic abundances derived for 𝑡2 = 0.038 ± 0.004 are shown
in Tables A3 and A4. Table A3 also shows the references of the
spectroscopic data as well as the values of 𝑛e and 𝑇e computed by
Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020) and Arellano-Córdova et al. (2021).
To obtain the total abundances of C, N, Ne, Cl, S and Ar, it is
necessary to use ionization correction factors (ICFs) that take into
account the contribution of the unseen ions to the total abundances
of these elements. In this work, we adopt the ICFs from Amayo
et al. (2021). These ICFs have been determined from a carefully se-
lected large set of realistic photoionization models for extragalactic
H ii regions, covering a wide range of ionization degrees. More-
over, they allow us to include the uncertainties associated to each
ICF as a function of the ionization degree, which leads to a more
robust determination of the chemical abundances. When compar-
ing their selected sample of ∼1800 models (from which the ICFs
where derived) to our sample of Galactic H ii regions, we ﬁnd good
consistency with the vast majority of our objects, supporting the
validity of using these ICFs in this work even though they were
proposed for a diﬀerent kind of objects. In some objects, it is pos-

sible to obtain the total abundances of N, S and Cl by considering
only their ionic abundances (without using an ICF). We ﬁnd good
agreement between the derived total abundances of N, S and Cl and
the predictions of the ICFs. The diﬀerences are smaller than 0.08
dex, a value smaller than the mean uncertainties obtained for the
total abundances of these elements (of ∼0.12 dex).

In order to propagate the uncertainties in the total abundances,
we generate a log-normal distribution of 400 Monte Carlo exper-
iments with a 1𝜎 deﬁned by the lower and upper uncertainties of
the ionic abundances (following eq. 13 from Amayo et al. 2021)
and choose a random ICF from a second log-normal distribution,
deﬁned in the same way by the lower and upper uncertainties of
each ICF. We then compute the total abundances and report the
nominal values and the 16 and 84 percentiles as their lower and
upper uncertainties, respectively.

In the estimates of the total abundance of Ar, we only consider
the regions where both [Ar iii] and [Ar iv] emission lines are ob-
served, as Amayo et al. (2021) recommends. This criterion reduces
the number of objects where the total abundance of Ar is derived to
10 H ii regions.

In some objects, it is possible to derive the total abundances of
N, S and Cl without an ICF by simply adding the ionic abundances
of the available ions because either the ionization degree or the
depth of the spectra allow to observe emission lines of all the ions
of each element that should be present in the nebula. Here, we
follow the same criteria used by Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020) to
identify these objects, although in some cases the number of H ii
regions changes with 𝑡2 > 0 because it can produce a slight change
in the ionization degree. The resulting total abundances are shown
in Table A5.

For Sh 2-83, Sh 2-100, Sh 2-128, Sh 2-209, M 17, M 42,
NGC 2579, NGC 3576 and NGC 3603 Méndez-Delgado et al.
(2020) estimated a small value of the radiation softness parame-
ter (log(𝜂) < 0.9, see Vilchez & Pagel 1988, for a deﬁnition of 𝜂).
In these cases, the amount of neutral helium within the ionized gas
is negligible (Pagel et al. 1992). Therefore, we only consider these
regions to our analysis of the total helium abundances, assuming
He/H ≈ He+/H+.

4.2 The radial abundance gradients

Using the abundances obtained and the updated Galactocentric
distances, we compute the radial abundance gradients assuming
𝑡2 = 0.0 and 𝑡2 > 0.0. We have strict control of the uncertainties in
both quantities: distances and total abundances (which include un-
certainties from the ICFs). The ﬁt parameters (slope and intercept)
of the revised radial gradients are given in Table 2.

The radial gradients for He, C, N, O, Ne, S, Cl and, Ar are
shown in Fig. 4. For the abundances determined from CELs, the
black dashed lines indicate the gradients obtained assuming 𝑡2 > 0
while the green ones indicate those with 𝑡2 = 0.0. Although the
abundances of C2+ have been determined from RLs (and therefore
they are independent on 𝑡2), the total abundances of C depend on the
ICF(C+), which varies slightly with 𝑡2. Following Arellano-Córdova
et al. (2020, 2021), we discard several objects to compute the radial
abundance gradients of N and Ne, because of their odd abundances
and high uncertainties. In the case of Cl, we discarded the abun-
dances obtained for Sh 2-219, Sh 2-237 and Sh 2-271, because of
their very high and uncertain Cl/H ratios. In fact, these objects are of
very low ionization degree, implying that their associated ICFs are
very high and uncertain. The red circles and the purple diamonds
in the aforementioned ﬁgure represent the present-day photospheric

respectively.

The comparison between the chemical composition of the Sun,
which was formed 4.57 Gyr ago (Asplund et al. 2021), and that of
the H ii regions, which have been formed much more recently, may
not be straightforward. Nuclear processing, radioactive decay and
diﬀusion can change the derived chemical composition of the Sun
(Asplund et al. 2021). Also, most of the proto-solar abundances
are expected to be lower than abundances of young objects, due
to the chemical enrichment of the ISM from the Sun’s birth until
the present-day. According to Asplund et al. (2021), the diﬀerence
between the proto-solar and photospheric abundances of helium
is 0.070 dex, and of heavier elements is 0.064 dex, although the
latter may be even smaller, of 0.03 dex, depending on the mixing
scheme considered. On the other hand, Carigi et al. 2019 estimate
an O enrichment of ∼0.1 dex for the last 4.6 Gyr in our galaxy at
𝑅𝐺 = 8 kpc, based on chemical evolution models. Since both the
impact of the solar diﬀusion as well as the chemical enrichment
during the last ∼5 Gyr are similar or even smaller than the typical
uncertainties in the abundance determinations in ionized nebulae
and stellar abundances, we will use the present-day photospheric
solar abundances in our comparisons, keeping in mind its possible
associated uncertainty.

When comparing with the solar abundances, it should be con-
sidered the possible radial migration of the Sun since its formation.
Recent dynamical and chemodynamical models for the Milky Way
disk have estimated a low radial migration for the Sun (e.g., Klačka
et al. 2012; Martínez-Barbosa et al. 2015; Martinez-Medina et al.
2017). Klačka et al. found a radial-migration average of 0.23 ± 0.68
kpc, Martínez-Barbosa et al. claimed that the Sun has unlikely mi-
grated, and Martinez-Medina et al. estimated an average of radial
migration of 0.32±1.40 kpc. Hence, we consider the Sun is represen-
tative of the solar neighborhood and consequently the comparison
of the chemical gradients (at 𝑅𝐺 ∼ 8 kpc) with the solar composi-
tion is appropriate, if the age diﬀerence between H ii regions and
the Sun is neglected, as we mention above.

5 DISCUSSION

The use of distances based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes by Méndez-
Delgado et al. (2020); Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020, 2021) and
our revision based on Gaia EDR3 have been an important step
forward to improve the quality of the abundance gradients deter-
minations. Comparing the results obtained assuming kinematic or
parallax-based distances have raised interesting issues. In the case of
Esteban & García-Rojas (2018), the underestimation of the Galac-
tocentric distances of Sh 2-61, Sh 2-90, M 8, M 16, M 17, M 20
and NGC 3576, produced an apparent ﬂattening at 𝑅𝐺 < 8 kpc in
the abundance gradients of several elements. If true, as Esteban &
García-Rojas (2018) discuss, this would imply a somewhat diﬀerent
chemical evolution of the central parts of the Galaxy, invoking the
possible action of the Galactic bar. However, this seems to be a
spurious result produced by the underestimation of small 𝑅G values
due to the use of rotation model-dependent distance estimates. It
is important to note that the latest calibrations made to the Galac-
tic rotation curves by Reid et al. (2014, 2019), produce consistent
results with the parallax-based distances from Gaia EDR3 for our
sample of H ii regions.

Galactic abundance gradients

5.1 The reliability of the derived gradient of helium

Méndez-Delgado et al. (2020) found a negative slope in the radial
abundance gradient of He determined from H ii regions of the Milky
Way. Although there was marginal evidence of a negative helium
gradient in some previous works (see Hawley 1978; Peimbert et al.
1978; Talent & Dufour 1979; Shaver et al. 1983a; Deharveng et al.
2000; Fernández-Martín et al. 2017), the uncertainties of those de-
terminations made them compatible with a ﬂat distribution. There
are several factors that make it diﬃcult to determine the abundance
gradient for this element: (i) unlike the heavier elements, the abun-
dance of primordial He is relatively high, so its relative increase due
to stellar nucleosynthesis is rather small, (ii) the known metastabil-
ity of the 23S level of the He atom in its triplet conﬁguration makes
it very sensitive to self-absorptions and collisions, which generates
deviations in the populations of the triplet levels expected by pure
recombination, and (iii) estimating the He0/H+ abundance is a dif-
ﬁcult issue, and its contribution is expected to be important for the
range of ionization degree of most Galactic H ii regions. Consid-
ering these factors, we restrict ourselves to 9 highly-ionized H ii
regions where He+/H+ ≈ He/H due to the hardness of their ioniz-
ing sources, covering a range of Galactocentric distances between
6.45 and 17 kpc.

If the thus determined radial gradient of He is accurate, the
relations between 𝑌 (He abundance by mass) and O/H must be
used to extrapolate the primordial helium value. The most recent
determinations of the primordial helium abundance are consistent
with a fraction of primordial baryonic mass in helium 𝑌𝑝 ranging
between 0.243 to 0.247 (Aver et al. 2015; Peimbert et al. 2016;
Fernández et al. 2019; Hsyu et al. 2020; Planck Collaboration et al.
2020; Kurichin et al. 2021; Valerdi et al. 2021). In Fig. 5 we show the
determinations of 𝑌𝑝 considering the sample of regions adopted for
the determination of the Galactic radial abundance gradient of He.
For the normalization, we have considered that oxygen per unit of
mass represents 55 ± 10 per cent of the metallicity 𝑍 (Peimbert et al.
2007). The value of 𝑌𝑝 considering 𝑡2 = 0 is 0.229±0.014 while the
one obtained considering 𝑡2 > 0 is 0.236 ± 0.012. Since both values
are formally consistent with the most precise determinations of 𝑌𝑝
within the uncertainty bars, it gives further support to the reliability
of our determination of the Galactic radial abundance gradient of
He.

5.2 The radial gradients of heavy elements under the 𝑡2

paradigm

The resulting gradients of C, N, O, Ne, and S considering 𝑡2 = 0.0
are in excellent agreement with those reported by Arellano-Córdova
et al. (2020, 2021) and therefore, the results and the discussion re-
garding these elements remain unchanged. However, we ﬁnd some
diﬀerences in the gradients of Cl and Ar. In this work we only con-
sider those regions with estimates of both Ar+2 and Ar+3 since the
ICFs constrained only with the Ar+2 abundance are rather uncertain
(Amayo et al. 2021). Due to this methodological diﬀerence, our Ar
gradient with 𝑡2 = 0.0 is slightly ﬂatter in comparison to what is
found by Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020), although both are consis-
tent within the uncertainties. In the case of Cl, Arellano-Córdova
et al. (2020) used the ICF scheme derived by Esteban et al. (2015),
obtaining a steeper gradient than our results, although they are also
consistent within the uncertainties.

As mentioned in Sec 4, it is usual to estimate the value of 𝑡2
from the measured ADF(O2+). However, there are fewer studies that
also calculate the ADF for other ions such as C2+, O+, N2+ or Ne2+

gradients of elements diﬀerent than O and their comparison with
the solar abundances is pertinent and it is not a circular argument.
The deﬁnition of 𝑡2 is not incompatible with the temperature
stratiﬁcation of the nebulae – which explains that generally 𝑇e([N ii])
is higher than 𝑇e([O iii]) –; it just quantiﬁes the level of temperature
inhomogeneities within the emission volume (out of the expected
stratiﬁcation). Assuming a global value of 𝑡2 > 0 in each H ii region
aﬀects the determination of the abundances of low and high ioniza-
tion ions in diﬀerent proportions since, generally, the temperatures
associated with each volume are diﬀerent in addition to the diﬀerent
dependence of 𝑡2 with the excitation energy of the emission lines
(see eq.(11) in Peimbert et al. 2004). This means that the parameters
of the linear ﬁts to the gradients – slope and intercept – for 𝑡2 > 0 are
susceptible to change with respect to the case of assuming 𝑡2 = 0.
Fig. 4 shows the Galactic radial abundance gradients derived
in this work by considering 𝑡2 = 0.038 ± 0.004 and 𝑡2 = 0. In the
second panel of the right column, we show the O gradient. The
blue circles represent the total O abundances derived from RLs for
M 8, M 16, M 17, M 20, M 42, NGC 3576, NGC 3603, Sh 2-311
and NGC 2579 (Esteban et al. 2005, 2013). The slope with 𝑡2 > 0
is slightly steeper with respect to the 𝑡2 = 0 case. The resulting
gradient is consistent with the recent O gradient of Luck (2018),
based on an updated sample of ∼400 classical Cepheids in the
Galactic disc. If the paradigm of temperature ﬂuctuations is valid,
then the agreement between the O gradient with 𝑡2 > 0 and the
solar abundances implies that the depletion of O into dust grains in
the solar neighborhood regions is smaller than the uncertainty bars,
in consistency with the results of Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009) and
Peimbert & Peimbert (2010) who estimated a depletion of O into
dust of up to 0.11 dex.

The radial distribution of the Ar/O abundance ratio, shown in
Fig. 6, is almost ﬂat, both in the case with 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0 (with
slopes of −0.011 ± 0.010 and −0.014 ± 0.010 dex kpc−1, respec-
tively). Since both elements are produced by 𝛼-particle captures in
massive stars, their abundance ratio should be constant, although
there may be a small fraction of Ar produced in Type-Ia supernovae,
according to the Galactic chemical evolution models of Kobayashi
et al. 2020, which would add an extra scattering factor in the Ar/O
distribution, as discussed in Amayo et al. (2021). The dispersion of
the order of 0.1 dex in the distribution of Ar/O can serve as an upper
limit to the possible depletion of O into dust grains, since there are
several factors that contribute to the observed dispersion, such as
uncertainties in the ionic abundances of both O and Ar as well as
of the ICF of Ar and the possible production of Ar in supernovae.
The solar N/H given by Lodders (2019) and Asplund et al.
(2021) is between the values predicted by the radial gradient of N
considering 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0.0. The slope obtained with 𝑡2 > 0,
shown in Table 2, is slightly steeper when compared to some values
in the literature (e.g., Shaver et al. 1983b; Aﬄerbach et al. 1996;

–getting that the ADF can be diﬀerent in each ion– and essentially
none considering other diﬀerent ions. Therefore, the consistency
between the solar abundances of O and the abundances of nearby
H ii regions with 𝑡2 > 0 is not surprising, since in these regions
the RLs provide abundances closer to the solar ones. However, this
does not necessarily imply that this consistency must be replicated
in the abundances of other elements such as N, S, Cl or Ar, since
by construction, the determination of 𝑡2 does not consider the ADF
of any ion of these elements. Therefore, the discussion about the

Esteban & García-Rojas 2018; Arellano-Córdova et al. 2021). It
has better consistency with the slope value of −0.085 ± 0.020 dex
kpc−1 determined by Carigi et al. (2005). Additionally, we deter-
mine the gradient of log(N/O) when 𝑡2 > 0, since this ratio has
important implications for the N production mechanisms. Taking
into account temperature inhomogeneities, we obtain a radial gra-
dient of log(N/O) with a slope of −0.018 ± 0.015 dex kpc−1. This
means that 𝑡2 > 0 do not alter the N/O gradient, which is consistent
with that found by Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020, 2021) considering
𝑡2 = 0. When comparing N/O to the O/H, we do not observe a clear
plateau as metallicity decreases, and all objects seems to follow a
slightly positive trend instead. The distribution of N/O versus O/H,
shown in Fig. 7 has a positive slope of 0.12 ± 0.20 when 𝑡2 > 0, a
value that is maintained even when the most metallic and uncertain
points are removed. This supports the contribution of some sec-
ondary N in the Galactic disc and is expected due to the metallicity
range of our sample, since previous works in our Galaxy and other
star forming galaxies suggest the primary N production mechanism
dominates only at 12 + log(O/H) (cid:46) 8.0 (van Zee et al. 1998; Henry
et al. 2000; Vincenzo et al. 2016; Esteban et al. 2020). However, a
ﬂat distribution cannot be ruled out considering the uncertainty of
the slope of our N/O versus O/H distribution.

The radial gradients of Ne, S and Ar under the paradigm of
𝑡2 > 0 are consistent with the solar values given by Lodders (2019)
and Asplund et al. (2021), while those obtained with 𝑡2 = 0 fail to
reproduce both sets of solar abundances. The slopes obtained for
these gradients, taking into account temperature inhomogeneities,
are steeper than those derived by Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020)
with 𝑡2 = 0. These gradients are also consistent with the O one
within the uncertainties, as expected because they are 𝛼-elements
and are produced by the same population of massive stars (Kunth &
Sargent 1983). In the case of 𝑡2 > 0, we ﬁnd that the S abundances
of Sh2 257, Sh2 271 and IC 5146 can be calculated without an
ICF due to their low degree of ionization (following the criterion of
Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020) of O++/(O++O++) ≤ 0.03).

In the case of Cl, we do not use an ICF for M 20, M 17,
M 42, NGC 2579, NGC 3576, and NGC 3603 when 𝑡2 > 0, either
because they have low degree of ionization (O++/(O++O++) ≤ 0.26
(Arellano-Córdova et al. 2020) or because they show [Cl ii], [Cl iii]
and [Cl iv] emission lines in their spectra, allowing to compute the
Cl abundance directly by summing up ionic abundances. In Fig. 4 it
can be seen that the Cl gradient with 𝑡2 > 0 obtained with the rest of

objects is consistent with the solar values from Lodders (2019) and
Asplund et al. (2021), while the homogeneous temperature scenario
fails to reproduce these values (a behaviour also found by Arellano-
Córdova et al. 2020). Nevertheless, it also must be considered that
the solar values of Cl/H are somewhat uncertain, since they can only
be obtained from sunspot spectra because the solar spectrum does
not include atomic features of Cl. This implies that its determination
relies additionally on the molecular data used and on the atmosphere
model to be suitable for a sunspot with unknown temperature, which
makes their uncertainty probably larger than quoted (Asplund et al.
2021).

As discussed by Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020), we also ex-
pect a lockstep evolution of Cl and the rest of 𝛼−elements (O among
them), because they are produced in the same nucleosynthesis pro-
cesses (being Cl an intermediate product of these). We ﬁnd that the
Cl gradient slope is consistent with those of all the 𝛼−elements,
except for O, both when 𝑡2 = 0 and when 𝑡2 > 0. Both in the case
𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0, the slopes of the gradients of O and Cl diﬀer
by 50%. This diﬀerence do not rely on the ICF used as it remains
even when the ICF from Esteban et al. (2015) is used. Instead, this
inconsistency seems to be originated in a statistical diﬀerence be-
tween the sample of regions used to derive the O and Cl gradients.
The number of objects used to obtain the gradient of O is larger than
that of Cl, sampling a wider range of Galactocentric distances. If we
constrain our sample to those regions in the range of Galactocentric
distances between 6.0 kpc < 𝑅𝐺 < 15.0 kpc – which covers the
well-sampled area in the Cl gradient – we obtain slopes of the O
gradient of −0.038±0.010 dex kpc−1 and −0.051±0.010 dex kpc−1
for 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0, respectively. These values are in better agree-
ment with the slopes of the Cl gradients for each case, as expected
under the mentioned scenario.

It is interesting to compare our gradients with 𝑡2 > 0 with those
gradients derived from CELs in the FIR. These lines, due to their
origin, have a much lower dependence on temperature than optical
CELs. Therefore, if chemical abundances based on optical CELs are
underestimated in the case of 𝑡2 = 0, the abundances derived with
FIR should be less aﬀected, being more similar to our predictions
with 𝑡2 > 0. Rudolph et al. (2006) determined the gradients of N, O
and S using FIR CELs. For the O gradient, our slope is steeper and
our intercept is higher in both cases: 𝑡2 = 0 and 𝑡2 > 0. This may
be due to the fact that the determination of the total O abundance in

(2021)the work of Rudolph et al. (2006) is not direct, requiring an ICF to
correct for the lack of [O II] lines in their FIR spectra. Errors in the
ICF are especially critical for the innermost regions of the Galaxy
where O+ is usually the dominant ion. In the case of N, although our
determinations and those of Rudolph et al. (2006) require the use of
ICFs to estimate the contribution of N2+ and N+, respectively, both
kinds of results are in agreement when the abundance derived with
𝑡2 > 0 are considered in the optical data. In the case of S, both ions
S+ and S3+ may have relevant contributions to the total abundance.
The slope of the radial gradient of S from Rudolph et al. (2006) is
consistent with ours in the case of 𝑡2 > 0, this is not the case when
comparing the intercept.

In the case of the N/O ratio, the slopes of both gradients are
consistent within the uncertainties. Moreover the N/O vs O/H dis-
tribution have a similar qualitative behavior: the observed trend in
the optical with 𝑡2 = 0 is practically ﬂat (In our case log(N/O) =
-0.77 ± 0.08, Arellano-Córdova et al. 2021), while that observed
in both FIR and optical CELs with 𝑡2 > 0 has a positive slope.
Both the FIR and the optical data with 𝑡2 > 0 may support the con-
tribution of some secondary N in the Galactic disc. However, the
uncertainties are large enough to prevent us from being conclusive.
The comparison between the optical data results assuming 𝑡2 = 0
and the gradients obtained for H ii regions by other groups or other
objects has been extensively discussed in Arellano-Córdova et al.
(2020, 2021).

In our sample of Galactic H ii regions, we found no evidence
of azimuthal variations in the chemical abundances and, essentially,
their distribution depends only on the Galactocentric distance. How-
ever, our sample is concentrated in two Galactic quadrants, as shown
in Fig. 1, whose characteristics may be diﬀerent from the H ii regions
located in the rest of the Galaxy (Wenger et al. 2019).

Recently, De Cia et al. (2021) have claimed that there are
variations of up to 1 dex in the metallicity of the neutral gas of the
solar neighborhood. We deﬁnitively do not observe such variations
in H ii regions. The O abundances – the proxy of metallicity in
ionized nebulae– present a rather uniform linear distribution with
the Galactocentric radius, independently of considering 𝑡2 = 0 or
𝑡2 > 0. In fact, the radial gradient of O is already perceptible even if
we limit ourselves to heliocentric distances less than 3 kpc – as the
data of De Cia et al. (2021) – given the quality of our spectra and
the detail of our analysis. As mentioned before and contrary to what
happens with Fe and Ni atoms, the impact of O depletion onto dust
grains is limited to a factor of the order of 0.1 dex at maximum, an
order of magnitude below the variations acclaimed by De Cia et al.
(2021). This implies that any hypothetical pristine gas inclusions in
the solar neighborhood must be well mixed in present-day Galactic
H ii regions.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we determine the radial abundances gradients of He, C,
N, O, Ne, S, Cl and Ar in the Milky Way assuming the temperature
ﬂuctuations paradigm, 𝑡2 > 0, and the most recent parallax-based
distances using Gaia EDR3 data. The analysis of the physical con-
ditions and chemical abundances of this work is complementary to
the previous ones by Méndez-Delgado et al. (2020) and Arellano-
Córdova et al. (2020, 2021), where a homogeneous temperature
structure, 𝑡2 = 0, is assumed.

We calculate the parallax-based distances to the Galactic H ii
regions through the identiﬁcation of their ionizing sources and using
the Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) statistical approach. The comparison of

the Gaia EDR3 parallax-based distances with kinematic ones shows
that the Galactic rotation curve of Reid et al. (2014, 2019), calibrated
with maser parallaxes obtained at radio wavelengths, provide more
consistent results than the classic rotation curve of Brand & Blitz
(1993) for the regions of our sample.

To apply the Peimbert’s 𝑡2 formalism (Peimbert 1967), we use
the weighted mean of the 𝑡2 values obtained for M 8, M 16, M 17,
M 20, NGC 3576, NGC 3603, Sh 2-311 and NGC 2579 assuming
that the ADF(O++) is produced by temperature ﬂuctuations (García-
Rojas & Esteban 2007; Esteban et al. 2013). That sample of H ii
regions covers 𝑅𝐺 values between 6.5 and 11.6 kpc. We ﬁnd that 𝑡2
shows a rather constant distribution with 𝑅𝐺, which suggests that a
𝑡2 = 0.038 ± 0.004 may be representative for our sample. We apply
the Peimbert (1967) formalism using the representative 𝑡2 value and
the ionic abundances determined by Arellano-Córdova et al. (2020,
2021), obtained under the assumption of 𝑡2 = 0. To estimate the
total abundances of C, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, we use the ICFs from
Amayo et al. (2021), including the uncertainties of the ICFs in our
calculations.

We ﬁnd that total abundances determined from CELs of all
elements at a given 𝑅𝐺 increase by up to 0.3 dex when 𝑡2 > 0 is
considered, becoming more consistent with the solar values recom-
mended by Lodders (2019) and Asplund et al. (2021). The radial
distributions of the 𝛼-elements are consistent with a common slope
–which is expected due to their common nucleosynthesis– when
using 𝑡2 > 0. The 𝑡2 formalism does not seem to introduce incon-
sistencies in the distributions of the chemical abundances studied.
Therefore it can be invoked as a likely explanation of the ADF
problem in Galactic H ii regions. However, the demonstration of the
physical processes that may generate these temperature ﬂuctuations
is a matter of debate and there is still no deﬁnitive solution to this
problem.
