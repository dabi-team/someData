Superconductivity in FeSe was investigated under high pressure through the measurements of DC
magnetization by using a diamond anvil cell. We successfully observed that the disappearance of the
superconductivity as a results of the appearance of the non-superconducting ortho II phase above
∼7 GPa (∼5 GPa), when Ar (glycerin) is used as the pressure transmitting media. Contrary to this,
it has been found that the superconductivity even survives under pressure above 7 GPa, when the
thickness (t) of a platelet-single crystal specimen is reduced. The survival of the superconductivity
above 7 GPa is consistent with a previous observation under hydrostatic pressure by using a cubic
anvil apparatus, suggesting that the hydrostaticity of the pressure is improved by reducing t. It
is also inferred that the appearance of the ortho II phase is due to uniaxial stress along the [001]
direction.

LaFeAsO1−xFx
the past
decade have uncovered a wide variety of iron-pnictide
superconductors and common unconventional super-
conductivity emerged from the competition with the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and electronic nematic
phase with an orthorhombic structure, which is inferred
from the characteristic phase diagrams. In early studies,
a typical phase diagram for AFe2As2 (A=Sr, Ba, Ca,
Eu) has been established, where a superconducting dome
appears with disappearance of both AFM and nematic
phases by tuning carrier doping2–5 or applying external
pressure6–12.
In addition to a similar competition
between the superconductivity and AFM (orthorhom-
bic) phase in LaFeAsO1−xFx
the coexistence of
superconductivity with these phases has been found for
NaFe1−xAxAs (A=Co14,15, Cu16) and SrVO3FeAs17,18.
In addition, a twin-dome structure and plateau-like
single-dome structure with bipartite parent phases
were found in RFeAsO1−xHx with R=La19 and Sm20,
respectively. In comparison, LaFeAs1−xPxO was found
to exhibit two superconducting domes separated by an
AFM phase21–23, suggesting that a diﬀerent supercon-
ducting state is realized in each dome. To establish the
phase diagram for various iron-pnictide superconductors
is crucial to throw further light on the superconducting
mechanism, because certain ﬂuctuations arising from the
ordered states that are either competing or coexisting
with the superconductivity in the phase diagram are
promising candidates for paring glue.

One of the most attractive subjects to explore the
temperature (T )-pressure (P ) phase diagram is FeSe.
This is because the superconducting transition temper-
ature Tc of FeSe was found to be highly enhanced in

early studies24–28. Furthermore, the nematic state was
observed to appear without accompanying AFM order
at ambient pressure, suggesting that FeSe provides an
interesting test ground for examining the competition
and coexistence of the superconducting, AFM, and ne-
matic phases. Indeed, the disappearance of the nematic
transition and a three-step increase in Tc under pres-
sure was reported.29 However, more intensive studies un-
der pressure succeeded in elucidating the T −P phase
diagram since single crystal growth to obtain purely
tetragonal FeSe without mixing of hexagonal phase was
enabled30,31. A pressure induced AFM phase above 1.2
GPa has been shown to exist32 and a T −P phase dia-
gram where a dome-shaped AFM phase competes with
two other phases has been reported.33 The AFM ordering
was shown to be of the stripe-type through NMR34 and
µSR35 measurements and also to merge with the struc-
tural (nematic) transition above 1.7 GPa.36 This suggests
that the AFM and nematicity are strongly coupled with
each other in FeSe under pressure, similar to other iron-
based superconductors.

An important feature of the T −P phase diagram,
which was determined by the measurements of electri-
cal resistivity and AC susceptibility using a cubic anvil
apparatus (CAA), is that Tc is signiﬁcantly enhanced and
reaches a maximum of ∼37 K at ∼6 GPa, above which
the AFM phase boundary line is suddenly terminated,
demonstrating the competing nature of the AFM and su-
perconducting phases.33 In addition, recent X-ray diﬀrac-
tion (XRD) measurements detected a mixing of an or-
thorhombic P nma phase with MnP-type structure (ortho
II) above 6 GPa, which is non-superconducting and char-
acterized by a three-dimensional network of face sharing
FeSe6 octahedra, with a superconducting orthorhombic

 
 
 
 
 
 
Cmma phase (ortho I).37 A similar transition to the or-
tho II phase was also observed through measurements of
XRD38 and X-ray absorption spectroscopy39. FeSe was
known to undergo a structural transition at high pres-
sure before the synthesis of purely tetragonal FeSe is
possible.25–27,40 Although the superconductivity would
be expected to disappear as the result of the appearance
of the ortho II phase, no signature of the disappearance
was inconsistently observed in AC susceptibility measure-
ments using a CAA up to ∼9 GPa.33 It is important to
clarify the origin of the inconsistency to gain more in-
sight into the superconductivity of FeSe and also for fur-
ther investigations under pressure. The origin is likely
to be attributable to the diﬀerence in the hydrostaticity
of the pressure cell, considering that diamond anvil cells
(DACs) were commonly used for the observation of the
ortho II phase.37–39

In the present work, we performed DC magnetization
measurements under pressure for single crystals of FeSe
using DAC and Ar as the pressure-transmitting medium
(PTM) and investigated the pressure variation of the su-
perconducting volume fraction. We successfully observed
that the superconductivity disappears and survives un-
der pressure above 7 GPa depending on the thickness of
the platelet single-crystal specimen used for the measure-
ments. The superconductivity was similarly observed to
disappear at lower pressure of ∼5 GPa when less hydro-
static PTM (glycerin) was used, suggesting that uniaxial
compression along the [001] direction promotes the tran-
sition into the ortho II phase.

Single-crystal specimens were obtained by a chemical
vapor transport method,30,31 details of which are avail-
able in the literature.41 The XRD pattern of the FeSe sin-
gle crystals is shown in Fig. 1(a), where the (00l) peaks
are observed, indicating that the (00l) plane is exposed
on the surface of the platelet crystals shown in the inset of
Fig. 1(b). Figure 1(b) and 1(c) show the temperature (T )
dependences of the DC magnetization (M ) and electri-
cal resistivity (ρ), respectively. These data indicate that
Tc is ∼9 K and the nematic transition temperature Ts is
∼90 K at ambient pressure, both of which are consistent
with those in earlier reports.31,33 High-pressure magnetic
measurements were done by using a miniature DAC,42
which was combined with a sample rod of a commercial
SQUID magnetometer. We used a CuBe gasket with a
0.3 mmφ gasket hole, where a platelet FeSe single crys-
tal was loaded parallel to the culet plane of the diamond
anvil together with a small piece of high-purity Pb to re-
alize the in-situ determination of pressure. The magneti-
zation data for FeSe and Pb were obtained by subtract-
ing the magnetic contribution of the DAC measured in
an empty run from the total magnetization.28,29,43,44 As
the PTM, we mainly used Ar, which solidiﬁes at P =1.2
GPa at room temperature as a soft molecular solid and
is known to be a hydrostatic PTM.45,46 For the measure-
ments, we adopted platelet single crystals with diﬀerent
thicknesses, which were ∼20 µm or less than ∼8 µm,
while the gasket thickness was typically ∼30 µm (40 µm)

after (before) the measurements. The thickness (t) of the
platelet specimens for t . 8 µm was estimated by using
a scanning electron microscope. Electrical resistivity of
a FeSe single crystal with dimensions of 0.9×0.5×0.035
mm3 was measured under pressure by using an opposed-
anvil cell.47

temperature,48 which induces a nearly uniaxial compres-
sion perpendicular to the (001) plane. It should be noted
that the disappearance has never been observed by ap-
plying a uniaxial stress in the [101] direction by using
NaCl as the PTM, as in the previous study.29 Thus, uni-
axial stress, especially along the [001] direction is likely
to be responsible for the disappearance of the supercon-
ductivity. M (T ) curves of FeSe at various pressures for
FeSe with t∼20 µm and t∼8 µm using Ar as the PTM,
are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. Fig.
3(a) shows that T dia

∼30 K at 6.7 GPa. Above 6.9 GPa, the ampli-

M (T ) ﬁnally almost stabilizes at 7.6 GPa. In contrast,
the M (T ) curves for t∼8 µm in Fig. 3(b) indicate that
T dia

with that for t∼20 µm up to 6.7 GPa; however, the am-
plitude of the diamagnetic response appears not to be

perconducting volume fraction, we estimated it from the
amplitude of the diamagnetic response as in the previ-
ous study.29 The superconducting volume fraction (p) at
T =0.5Tc normalized by that at ambient pressure (p0), as
a function of pressure for t∼20 µm and t∼8 µm, is plotted
in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. We excluded the con-
tribution of Pb to the amplitude of the magnetic response
to enable us to precisely estimate p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc) at
low pressures. In Fig. 4(a), p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc) for t∼20
µm shows an abrupt decrease to zero above ∼5 GPa when
glycerin was used as the PTM, whereas a sharp decrease
was observed at pressures above ∼7 GPa when Ar was
used, indicating the disappearance of the superconduc-
tivity. The pressure variations are qualitatively similar
to that of 1−pOR2, where pOR2 is the phase fraction of the
ortho II phase and is evaluated by the relative intensity of
Bragg reﬂections for the ortho II and tetragonal phases in
the XRD measurements under pressure using He as the
PTM.38 This suggests that the origin of the disappear-
ance of the superconductivity is due to the appearance
of the ortho II phase. In contrast, p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc) for
t∼8 µm in Fig. 4(b) remains ∼0.9 even above 7 GPa. To
verify the reproducibility, the measurements were also
performed using a single crystal of another batch with
t∼5 µm (Run 4). The results are shown in Fig. 4(b). It
is conﬁrmed that p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc) for t∼5 µm remains
more than 0.7 above 7 GPa. We can also observe a com-
mon tendency that p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc) is slightly reduced
between 1.5.P .6.0 GPa. This behavior is probably the
result of the coexistence of the AFM and superconducting

propose a possible scenario, in which the ortho II phase
appears owing to the degradation of the hydrostaticity
of the pressure for t∼20 µm, while the ortho II phase
does not appear for t . 8 µm because of the improve-
ment in the hydrostaticity resulting from the decrease
in the thickness of the crystal. The results for t . 8
µm are similar to those obtained in the measurements
using a CAA, which generates the perfect hydrostatic
pressure by three-axis compression. Indeed, it has been
shown in XRD measurements of Au using a DAC with
He that the increase in the uniaxial stress component
above 30 GPa tends to be suppressed as the height of
the sample decreases along the load direction.51 In addi-
tion, we failed to detect any sign of the disappearance of
the superconductivity using Ar as the PTM in the pre-
vious observation for a single crystal with dimensions of
∼0.1×0.1×0.02 mm3 where the (101) plane is exposed
on the surface.29 This suggests that the disappearance
is induced by a uniaxial component of the compression
along a speciﬁc direction [001]. This conclusion is also
supported by the results shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(c), where
solid-state compression along the [001] direction acceler-
ates the transformation to the ortho II phase.
In fact,
it was shown in a previous study that a large shrinkage
along the c-axis in the crystal structure is accompanied
by the transition to the ortho II phase, yielding a vol-
ume reduction of 11% at 300 K.37 This suggests that a
uniaxial stress along [001] direction could be important
for the occurrence of the transition. Thus, the above-
mentioned scenario is most likely, although it is unclear
how uniaxial stress can be generated for P < 12 GPa at
room temperature by using He as PTM. The relationship
among the three phases on the T -P phase diagram still
remains to be fully understood not only in pure-FeSe, but
also in S-doped52 and Te-doped FeSe,53 as is suggested
by the recent study reporting the coexistence of super-
conductivity and magnetic order on a tetragonal lattice
above 6 GPa.38 Further investigations at high pressure
are necessary in future studies. However, special atten-
tion should be given to the hydrostaticity of the pressure,
which greatly aﬀects the crystal structure of the single
crystal specimen with the (001) surface.

In summary, by conducting the DC magnetization
measurements, we successfully observed the disappear-
ance of the superconductivity in FeSe owing to the ap-
pearance of the ortho II phase. In addition, the survival
of the superconductivity owing to the absence of the or-
tho II phase was also observed using platelet single crys-
tal specimens with diﬀerent thicknesses.
It is inferred
from the results using both Ar and glycerin for the spec-
imens with t∼20 µm that uniaxial stress along the [001]
direction is essential to realize the ortho II phase. The
superconducting volume fraction for specimens with t .
8 µm was found to show no sudden decrease at high pres-
sure. This is consistent with the result observed in the
measurements under hydrostatic pressure using a CAA33,
such that the hydrostaticity can be improved by reducing
the thickness of the specimens in our measurements. In

of the AFM phase in the pressure region. Nonetheless,
p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc) possibly reﬂects the broadening of the
superconducting transition due to the co-existing AFM
phase rather than the reduction of the superconducting
volume fraction. A similar weakening of the diamagnetic
shielding in the pressure region where the AFM dome ap-
pears has been observed for FeSe1−xSx.49 In Figs. 4(a)
and 4(b), a small increase is seen in p(0.5Tc)/p0(0.5Tc)
for 0.P .1 GPa. This is probably attributable to an ini-
tial shrinkage in the thickness of the single crystal, which
leads to an increase in the demagnetization coeﬃcient.

cause He is generally known not to solidify up to ∼12
GPa at room temperature.50 However, to explain the
disappearance and survival of the superconductivity, we
