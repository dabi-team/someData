ABSTRACT 

Despite  the  large  literature  focused  on  the  growth  of  graphene  (Gr)  on  6H-SiC(0001)  by 
chemical vapour deposition (CVD), some important issues have not been solved and full wafer 
scale epitaxy of Gr remains challenging, hampering applications in microelectronics.  With this 
study  we  shed  light  on  the  generic  mechanism  which  produces  the  coexistence  of  two 
different types of Gr domains, whose proportion can be carefully controlled by tuning the H2 
flow rate. For the first time, we show that the growth of Gr using CVD under H2/Ar flow rate 
proceeds  in  two  stages.  Firstly,  the  nucleation  of  free-standing  epitaxial  graphene  on 
hydrogen (H-Gr) occurs, then H-atoms eventually desorb from either step edges or defects. 
This gives rise, for H2 flow rate below a critical value, to the formation of (6x6)Gr domains on 
6H-SiC(0001).  The  front  of  H-desorption  progresses  proportionally  to  the  reduction  of  H2. 
Using a robust and generic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we realistically 
quantify  the  proportions  of  H-Gr  and  (6x6)Gr  domains  of  a  Gr  film  synthetized  in  any 
experimental conditions. Scanning tunnelling microscopy supports the XPS measurements. 
From these results we can deduce that the H- assisted CVD growth of Gr developed here is a 
unique method to grow fully free-standing H-Gr on the contrary to the method consisting of 
H-intercalation below epitaxial Gr on buffer layer. These results are of crucial importance for 
future applications of Gr/SiC(0001) in nanoelectronics, providing the groundwork for the use 
of Gr as an optimal template layer for Van der Waals homo- and hetero-epitaxy.

   Since 2004,  the unique properties of graphene (Gr), a single layer of graphite, 1 2 3 4 have 
attracted a huge number of studies.5 6 Instead of graphite presenting a parabolic dispersion

at K-point of the Brillouin zone  7, graphene has a planar honeycomb structure and a linear 
dispersion. 8 9 2 Electrons behave like massless fermions around the Fermi energy level with 
an unprecedented Fermi velocity. 10 11 12 Graphene was initially obtained by exfoliation from 
bulk graphite 10 and then transferred onto silicon oxide 4. This procedure suffers of important 
electron-phonon scattering at the interface between graphene and the substrate underneath, 
resulting  in  a    carrier  mobility  reduction.13  Alternative  substrates  were  then  efficiently 
explored for the catalytic growth of Gr such as metals (Ni, 14 Pt, 15 Ru, 16 Ir, 17 Pd, 18 Cu 18 19), 
III-V alloys, 21 Boron Nitride (h-BN)  22 proving that high quality Gr can be properly transferred 
on various substrates. However, even if the exfoliation technique is simple, inexpensive and 
perfectly fitted to fundamental physics, its technological development is not enough when it 
comes to applications (in particular for microelectronic industry). 23 This because Gr flakes are 
not large (and homogeneous) enough, despite all the efforts devoted to improve the process 
for large scale applications 3 24 25.  

The growth of graphene by the sublimation process (called graphitization) 26 27 28 was then 
considered  as  a  technique  of  choice  for  potential  industrial  applications.  It  is  achieved  by 
thermal decomposition of SiC substrates at temperatures around 1600-2000°C under ultra-
high vacuum (UHV) 29 30 31  or under Ar atmosphere. 32 The method consists of sublimating 
silicon atoms from the SiC substrate, leaving behind carbon atoms in a graphene-like layer. 
About  30% of these carbon atoms are covalently bound to the Si  ones  underneath at the 
origin  of  the  (6√3  ×  6√3)R30°  reconstructed  interface  layer,  called  buffer  or  zero  layer, 
(hereafter referred (6x6)). However, thermal decomposition is not self-limiting and graphene 
films produced on both Si(0001)- and C(000-1)-terminated surfaces are commonly composed 
of  few  sub-micrometer  domains  with  1-3  MLs  thickness.  Uniformity  on  full  scale  wafers 
remains challenging. Gr grows much faster on C- face and forms larger domains (∼200 nm) of 
multilayer rotated Gr films (resulting from morphological changes of the SiC surface during Si 
sublimation) than on Si-face, where domains have <100 nm and a single orientation. 33 34  In 
order  to  obtain  Gr  layers  with  more  uniform  thickness,  various  approaches  have  been 
proposed to counteract the Si sublimation rate e.g. using simultaneous Si deposition (or using 
a mixture of Si and N2). The idea is to approach the thermodynamic equilibrium and better 
control the C-rich (6√3 × 6√3)R30° buffer layer and the resulting graphene thickness. 35 36 37 38 
39 A high pressure of Ar was also reported as an efficient way to reduce the Si evaporation 
since  part  of  the  desorbed  Si  atoms  are  reflected  back  to  the  surface  by  collision  with  Ar 
atoms. 40 41 26 High sublimation temperature was also shown to restructure and uniformize 
the terraces morphology. Another approach was to decouple the Gr layer from the substrate 
by H intercalation. 42 Therefore, many attempts were made to decouple the Gr layer from the 
SiC  substrate  by  H  intercalation,  so  passivating  the  Si  atoms  dangling  bonds  at  the  SiC 
interface.  42  This  H  intercalation  process,  starting  from  (6x6)Gr  epitaxial  layers  does  not 
produce full H-Gr layers (as testified by the presence of weak spots representative of the (6√3 
× 6√3)R30° buffer layer on LEED patterns).

 Gr/metal substrates interface was decoupled by  metals intercalation such as: Co, 43 Fe, 44 Au, 
45  Ni.  46  Oxygen  47  48  49  and  hydrogen  50  were  also  intercalated  between  Gr  and  metal 
substrates.  However,  Gr  decoupled  by  metals 
in 
microelectronic  and  would  require  the  film  transfer  onto  insulating  substrates,  procedure 
leading to defect creation. 

is  not  suitable  for  applications 

More  recently,  Graphene  has  also  been  grown  using  a  carbon  source  51  either  by  UHV-
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 51 or by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under Ar 52 53 54 or H2 
atmosphere 55 to meet the requirements of technological applications. SiC that was the first 
naturally used substrate has many advantages for the direct growth of Gr 22  in particular that 
of  providing  reproducible  and  reliable  high-quality  Gr  layers  with  a  well-controlled  and 
homogeneous thickness at large scale 56 both on Si- and C- faces of SiC(0001). It was reported  
53 57 that depending on the growth temperature and carrier gas pressure, Gr can be grown on 
top  of  the  buffer  layer  (henceforth  refer  to  as  (6x6)Gr)  that  has  the  (6√3  ×  6√3)R30° 
superstructure resulting from covalent bonds with the SiC substrate. The (6x6)Gr obtained by 
CVD on top of the buffer layer reconstructed (6√3 × 6√3)R30° has a structure very similar to 
the one of epitaxial Gr obtained by graphitization which has been extensively studied. 53 52 54 
On the other side,  the H-Gr configuration was only reported as the result of the intercalation 
of  H2  below  the  epitaxial  (6x6)Gr  using  H2  flux  at  temperatures  below  900°C  to  avoid  H2 
desorption,  42  58  59  while its formation by CVD using C-based gas (i.e. propane) and H2 (or 
H2/Ar mixture) carrier gas has already been demonstrated by A. Michon et al. 56 55 

In this work, we report the atomic configurations of Gr layers grown by CVD on 6H-SiC(0001) 
terminated Si, for three different (H2/Ar) carrier gas ratios and we deduce new insights into 
the  Gr  growth  mechanisms.  AFM,  STM,  LEED  and  XPS  analyses  give  evidence  different 
structural characteristics of the surfaces depending on the CVD conditions. For the first time, 
we demonstrate that the complex interplay between growth and etching mechanisms at work 
in the close to equilibrium conditions used, can produce full coverage of H-Gr or of (6x6)Gr 
depending  on  the  H2/Ar  flux  ratio,  the  transition  between  the  two  configurations  being 
controlled only by hydrogen desorption.  More precisely, we have found that for a H2/Ar ratio 
of 9% only (6x6)Gr grows. For H2/Ar increasing ratio, we observe the coexistence H-Gr and 
(6x6)Gr domains, and finally for 42% ratio a full H-Gr layer is obtained. The amount of H-Gr 
and the percentage of the coexistence of (6x6)Gr and H-Gr domains have been assessed by x-
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low energy 
electron  diffraction  (LEED)  careful  analyses.  These  investigations  indicate  that  the  switch 
between  the  two  configurations  is  controlled  by  hydrogen  desorption.  The  presence  of 
juxtaposed areas of (6x6)Gr and H-Gr, which is  underestimated in many studies, has a great 
influence  on the subsequent  deposition  of  Van der Waals  heterostructures.  60  61  62  63  64 In 
addition, our results show that CVD is a unique technique to grow uniform and homogeneous 
H-Gr monolayers at full wafer scale and with very low density of defects, that can serve as 
robust pseudo-substrates for Van der Waals heteroepitaxy.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

As  reported  in  Methods  section,  we  performed  several  H2/Ar  ratio  CVD  growths  on  6H-
SiC(0001) substrate. For all the obtained samples, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images 
always present the same features as shown in Figure 1 (the image corresponds to sample A 
where Gr is obtained at 1550°C, during 15min with 9% of H2). All the samples investigated 
exhibit large flat terraces with mean widths between 200 nm and 1 µm (figure 1a), separated 
by multi-layer steps (see line profile in figure 1b). Their height is commonly around 0.75 nm 
corresponding to tri-layer SiC steps; a few higher ones are also observed with a height of 1.5 
nm which corresponds to the total SiC crystalline cell (c = 1.51 nm). Some narrower terraces, 
separated from the larger ones by monoatomic SiC steps (Figure 1c and corresponding line 
profile in Figure 1d), with 0.25 nm mean height corresponding to single SiC monolayer are 
also observed. These step heights have already been observed along <1000> direction of the 
6H-SiC. 65 51 All these morphological features prove the preservation of the initial topography 
of the substrate.  

Graphene thin film having a carpet-like morphology, completely covers the SiC surface and 
then cannot be observed at the AFM scale. In the case of a full (6x6)Gr or full H-Gr, there are 
no changes of the height difference between two neighbour terraces. In the case of coexisting 
domains, height differences are too small to be visible by AFM (height difference between 
(6x6)Gr and H-Gr is expected to be 0.154 nm). Few specific irregular step edges and rough 
terraces morphologies observed on the surface (Figure 1c) are also assigned to the bare SiC 
substrate  underneath.  In  order  to  obtain  only  one  monolayer  (ML)  Gr  growth,  it  is 
fundamental  to  suitably  dose  the  percentage  of  the  hydrogen,  argon  and  propane  gases. 
Indeed, the surface morphology strongly depends on the competition between H2 etching of 
the  SiC  surface  and  C3H8  promoting  Gr  growth:  66  67  small  additions  of  propane  to  the 
hydrogen atmosphere suppresses the etching of SiC, while too large quantities could degrade 
the  surface  morphology.66  Our  CVD  experimental  conditions  are  very  close  to  the 
thermodynamic equilibrium ones. This ensures the formation of only one ML of Gr, whatever 
the growth duration. Gr growth rate mainly depends on H2 flow rate while temperature and 
total pressure have low effect. Moreover, the introduction of C3H8 is carefully controlled to 
avoid any morphological damage. 

Atomic structural properties of epitaxial Gr grown on a clean 6H-SiC(0001) are investigated 
by STM observations and LEED and XPS analyses.

of an area with  a narrower terrace separated by monolayer SiC  steps  (0.25 nm height);  (d) the 
corresponding line profile. The z scale for both images is 0- 1.6 nm. 

Systematic investigation of the Gr films was performed  on the as grown samples and after 
annealing. The detailed analysis of three typical samples obtained in different experimental 
conditions  is  reported.  The  first  Gr  film  was  obtained  in  low  H2  flux  (sample  A  in  Table  1 
displayed in Methods). In this condition, incorporation of H2 under the Gr film is very unlikely. 
Large scale STM images show a train of steps similar to the one observed by AFM separated 
by steps with heights about 0.75 nm (Figure 2a). Atomic resolution STM images reveal two 
superimposed honeycomb lattices having  periodicities of 3.2 ± 0.1 nm and 0.245 ± 0.2 nm

that  are  ascribed  to  the  (6√3  ×  6√3)R30°  6H-SiC  supercell  i  (noted  (6x6)  in  the  rest  of  the 
manuscript  for  simplicity)  and  to  Gr  lattice  parameter  respectively  (Figure  2b).  The  (6x6) 
reconstruction  has  a  corrugation  height  around  0.03  nm  which  is  assigned  to  the  partial 
interfacial interaction between the C atoms of the first deposited layer (buffer layer) Si atom-
terminated 6H-SiC(0001).  

The superimposition of the two lattices (6x6)SiC and (1x1)Gr can be appreciated better on a 
higher  magnification  STM  image  (Figure  2c).  This  feature  which  has  been  systematically 
observed all over the surface of this sample testifies that the buffer layer covers the whole 
surface.  Such  STM  images  have  been  already  reported  for  epitaxial  Gr  obtained  by 
sublimation of 6H-SiC(0001) 68 and of 4H-SiC(0001). 58 The main difference is the smoothness 
and uniformity of the surface which are much better in CVD experimental growth conditions.  

The presence of the buffer layer is also confirmed by the LEED pattern (Figure 2d). It reveals 
spots being the signature of the (1x1)SiC hexagonal lattice (indicated by the pink arrow), of 
the  (1x1)Gr  honeycomb  network  rotated  by  30°  with  respect  to  SiC  one  (indicated  by  the 
yellow arrow) and higher intensity spots (highlighted by the black arrow) located at vertexes 
of  hexagons  and  positioned  around  the  Gr  spots  that  are  representative  of  the  (6√3  × 
6√3)R30° reconstruction. Such patterns have been already reported widely in the literature 
for Gr grown on buffer layer (that we have named (6x6)Gr). 69 70 31 These superstructure spots 
correspond to the periodicity of the buckling of the buffer layer induced by its strong covalent 
interaction with the terminating Si-atoms of SiC substrate, as observed by STM. 71 72 73  

i  (6√3 × 6√3)R30°supercell with 3.2 nm periodicity corresponds to (6x6)Gr pseudo-supercell with 
periodicity 1.9 ± 0.1 nm (for detailed description see 84 74). It also corresponds to (13x13) Gr supercell.

0.495 nA and Ubias= -0.412 V; (b) and (c) It= 0.56 nA and Ubias= -1.56 V. 

XPS spectra of C1s (Figure 3a) and Si2p (Figure 3b) recorded on the same sample have been 
fitted  and  analysed  after  extraction  of  the  background.  The  C1s  peak  was  deconvoluted 
assuming four components already identified in the literature: 74 (a) C-Si bonds of the SiC bulk 
substrate (corresponding to C in sp3 configuration); (b) the top Gr layer (corresponding to C 
in the sp² hybridization); (c) the buffer layer which shares covalent bonds with the substrate; 
(d)  the  buffer  layer  in  sp²  configuration  (no  bonds  with  the  substrate).  The  two  last 
contributions, named S1 and S2, have been well detailed in 74 and their ratio (S1/S2 integrated 
area ratio) was estimated around 0.5. 31 74 In these experimental conditions, the best fit of 
the C1s peak is obtained when the 4 components of the pure (6x6)Gr (see supplementary 
material for details of the procedure) are located at ESiC =283.4 eV , EGr=284.2 eV,  ES1=284.6 
eV and ES2=285.3 eV in very good agreement with literature data. The results show that the 
sample is fully covered with (6x6)Gr. 

Another important issue is the number of deposited (6x6)Gr layers deposited which is a key 
factor for applications. This quantity is estimated by the quantification of C1s/Si2p area ratio, 
which is found around 1.55 for this sample. Such ratio excludes the possibility for having more 
than  1ML  and  is  then  refers  to  a  single  (6x6)Gr  ML.  In  addition,  it  confirms  the  STM 
observation which evidences a corrugation about 0.03 nm corresponding, according to the 
literature 70 75 to the first free-standing (6x6)Gr layer. Indeed, by increasing the number of Gr 
layers, the measured corrugation is expected to  lower  71  27  76. At last high resolution TEM 
cross-section image of the sample (Figure 3c) evidences the buffer layer and the top (6x6)Gr 

7 

 
 
 
 
at  the  interplanar  distances  already  reported  in  the  literature.  Therefore,  all  these  results 
confirm that in these experimental conditions with low H2 flow rate, a high-quality monolayer 
of (6x6)Gr is formed in perfect epitaxy with the SiC substrate. The film has few defects and 
very good homogeneity and uniformity throughout the full-scale sample as testified by large 
scale TEM cross-section images of the (6x6)Gr layer (see supplementary material). 77

resolution TEM cross-section image of the corresponding sample. 

The second Gr film investigated was obtained with a large H2 ratio ~ 42% (sample C in Table 
1).  The  surface  structure  observed  by  STM  exhibits  regular  train  of  steps  with  no  visible 
difference on  large scale image with the previous sample. However, the atomic resolution

images reveal the presence of only one honeycomb structure with 0. 25 nm lattice parameter 
(Figure 4a) which corresponds to the free-standing Gr layer (named H-Gr here). This suggest 
that in this sample, H is located under the Gr layer interface and saturates the Si dangling 
bonds as already observed in the literature 42 74 78 58. Most of the H-Gr layers reported in the 
literature have been obtained by post-growth hydrogenation of (6x6)Gr, i.e. intercalation of 
H between the (6x6) buffer layer and the SiC substrate. In these experiments, the buffer layer 
transforms  into  a  second  Gr  layer  beneath  the  initial  top  (6x6)Gr  layer.  The  H  diffusion 
channels pass through step edges and surface crystalline defects. Hydrogenation is commonly 
incomplete  as  testified  by  the  (6x6)  reconstruction  spots  always  observed  on  the  LEED 
patterns 42 58. In our experimental conditions, the complete sample is instead hydrogenated. 
Indeed, STM measurements do not display any area with (6x6)Gr (Figure 4a) and at higher 
magnification  (Figure  4b),  STM  images  show  the  uniform  intensity  of  all  the  atoms  of  the 
(1x1)Gr honeycomb network. This is typical of free-standing H-Gr and in stark contrast with 
graphite where only half of the atoms of the hexagon is visible (triangular cell).  Indeed, in 
graphite, the carbon planes are stacked according to Bernal arrangement, where the second 
C plane shifted with respect to the first induces that half of the atoms are aligned vertically 
(resulting in a high intensity), while the others are aligned with respect to the centre of the 
hexagons of the first plane (low or absent intensity).  

In addition, the LEED pattern of this sample exhibits (1×1)Gr and (1×1)SiC intense spots while 
(6x6)  reconstruction  is  invisible  (Figure  4c)  confirming  the  absence  of  the  buffer  layer  in 
agreement with STM observations.  

Figure 4: (a) Large scale STM image of Gr grown with H2=42% (sample C) (scanned areas 
800 nm × 800 nm) ; (b) higher magnification STM image of (a) which evidences the (1x1) Gr 
crystalline  cell(c)  LEED  pattern  of  the  same  sample  at  66  eV.  Tunneling  parameters  are 
It=1.36 nA and Ubias= -0.559 V for both images. 

XPS  spectra  of  C1s  (Figure  5)  recorded  on  this  sample  have  been  analysed  in  the  same 
conditions as  reported above. The C1s peak was deconvoluted assuming two components 
already identified in the literature for H-Gr 79 80: (e) the Si-C component referring to the SiC 
bulk  bonded  to  hydrogen  overlayer;  (f)  the  ML  Gr  with  sp²  configuration  on  hydrogen 
(decoupled from SiC underneath). The best fit is obtained when the C1s experimental peak is 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
deconvoluted into two components with ESiC at 282.5 eV and EGr at 283.8 eV. A very small tail 
of the peak observed at high energy has already been observed and is well fitted by replacing 
Lorentzian profile by a Doniach–Sunjic profile in pseudo-Voigt function.55 We can note that 
there  is  a  large  shift  (0.9  eV)  between  the  SiC  signatures  of  this  H-Gr  sample  and  of  the 
previous (6x6)Gr sample, with a lower binding energy when SiC is bound to H than when it is 
bound to the buffer layer (6x6)Gr. This was explained in the literature by the different band 
bending  occurring  at  the  SiC  substrate/Gr  interface  induced  by  the  different  doping  types 
between H-Gr (type P) and (6x6)Gr (type N) 59 74 78. It was also confirmed by ARPES 32.  

As above, we are concerned by the homogeneity and the thickness of the Gr film, that are 
crucial  for  many  potential  applications.  The  number  of  deposited  layers  was  evaluated  as 
above,  by  the  quantification  of  C1s/Si2p  area  ratio.  It  is  found  for  this  sample  around  1.1 
which excludes the possibility for having more than 1ML and attests the presence of a single 
H-Gr ML. This result is consistent with the STM images (reported above) which evidence an 
equivalent intensity of the six atoms of the (1x1)Gr hexagonal cell as expected for the  first 
free-standing H-Gr layer, otherwise we should have seen a high resolution STM arrangement 
like to graphite.

different fitted components (solid lines) are labelled in the spectrum. The solid red circles 
refer to the experimental data.  

STM, LEED and XPS show that the use of a high H2 flow rate ensures the production of H-Gr 
layers of very high quality, good homogeneity on full sample scale and uniform monolayer 
thickness.  They  also  show  that  by  tuning  the  H2  flow  rate,  we  can  switch  from  full 

10 

 
 
 
hydrogenated Gr to (6x6)Gr completely free of hydrogen and lying on the buffer layer, while 
keeping the layer homogeneous, flat and uniform on the full sample scale. 

Let us turn now to intermediate H2/Ar ratios in between the two preceding situations. We 
have chosen to report the surface structure for H2 ratio ~33% (sample B in Table 1), but similar 
results were obtained for samples with 10%< H2 ratio <42%, with different proportions of the 
observed configurations (see quantification and details of the procedure in supplementary 
material). For sample B, STM observations reveal the juxtaposition of terraces with (6x6)Gr 
and  H-Gr  domains  on  large  scales  (Figure  6a)  whose  morphologies  are  similar  to  those 
reported  above  (sample  A  for  (6×6)Gr  terraces  and  sample  C  for  H-Gr  terraces).  In  other 
words, there are two time more terraces in sample B with respect to samples A and C and in 
the latter samples, the size of the terraces corresponds to the mean terrace size of the SiC 
substrate.  The  higher  magnification  images  of  the  interface  between  these  two  domains 
(Figure 6b-c) evidence non-straight step edges with nanofacets following armchair directions 
for the most part and associated to kinks of 2 nm length, well matching (6x6) unit cells (in size 
and direction). This observation suggests that the transformation from one configuration to 
another is made by hopping of (6x6) unit cell following armchair directions. LEED pattern of 
the sample (Figure 6d) is fully consistent with STM observations and confirms the presence of 
both configurations with intense graphene spots, surrounded by less intense diffraction spots 
of the (6x6)Gr. This whole  body of evidence  proves that the sample is in a metastable (or 
pseudo-equilibrium) state with a transformation  from completely hydrogenated sample to 
non-hydrogenated sample that can be tuned with the H2 ratio. The distribution of the (6x6)Gr 
can be estimated from XPS spectra (Figure 7). In this sample, a repartition of 15% H-Gr / 85% 
(6x6)Gr has been estimated using XPS procedure (supplementary material). This is in good 
agreement  with  terraces  repartition  measured  by  STM,  where  a  65  %  coverage  ratio  was 
assessed for (6x6)Gr on large scale images after identification at high resolution of the two 
domains.

In summary, AFM observations of Gr/6H-SiC show that whatever the growth conditions are, 
the surface consists of wide terraces (some hundred nanometers large) separated by a regular 
train of tri-layer SiC steps (0.75 nm high) with accidentally few monolayer steps (0.25 nm high 
multiple) or six-layer steps (1.5 nm high). It is obvious that AFM observations cannot visualize 
the  single  monolayer  Gr  which  uniformly  covers  the  SiC  substrate  with  a  carpet-like 
morphology.  They  neither  discriminate  the  surface  configurations  between  H-Gr 
(hydrogenated graphene) and (6x6)Gr (graphene on buffer layer) domains. In spite of this, we 
note  that  AFM  is  very  often  used  to  show  the  homogeneity  of  graphene  thin  films,  in 
particular before deposition of further epitaxial layers, e.g. for the growth of Van der Waals 
heterostructures, whereas Gr atomic structure has a strong influence on both the adsorption 
energy of many species and their subsequent growth mode. 81 64 

The developed CVD process, which involves a combination of complex processes based on 
the interaction of H2/Ar and C3H8 is very robust and reliable. We have shown that it produces 
an uniform monolayer Gr on full sample scale, whose atomic properties (H-Gr or (6x6)Gr) can 
be varied as will, by tuning H2/Ar flow rate. This provides exceptional conditions to study the 
growth mechanism and the transition from one domain to another in detail. In addition, we 
have shown for the first time, that the proportions of H-Gr and (6x6)Gr can be realistically 

13 

 
 
 
quantified  on  large  scale  by  XPS,  using  a  detailed  and  precise  procedure  explained  in 
supplementary  material.  The  quantifications  obtained  have  been  confirmed  by  STM 
assessments.  

The growth process can be separated in three chronological stages: (i) sample heating, (ii) Gr 
growth  and  (iii)  sample  cooling.  During  heating,  three  mechanisms  are  at  work:  Si  and  C 
sublimation, SiC etching and passivation by hydrogen. Since a large etching rate favors the 
surface roughening, Ar is used to reduce the SiC etching (part of the desorbed C and Si atoms 
collide with argon atoms and return to the surface). Associated to Ar, H2 slowly etches and 
flattens SiC surface, catalyzing C and Si atoms sublimation accompanied by the formation of 
Si-H and C-H species. Simultaneously, it also fully covers and passivates the surface. The H2/Ar 
ratio is then crucial to provide a flat and fully passivated surface during the heating stage. 
When the growth temperature is reached (>1500°C), the SiC surface is fully hydrogenated. 
Such  high  growth  temperatures  also  help  to  restructure  and  uniformize  the  terraces 
morphology.  

When  C3H8  carbon  source  is  introduced  in  the  gas  mixture,  etching  stops  and  quasi-
equilibrium  conditions  are  achieved  between  etching/sublimation,  H2  adsorption  and  C 
deposition. In these conditions, the growth is self-limited and only one monolayer of Gr is 
deposited even for long deposition time. For large proportions of H2, the surface remains fully 
hydrogenated  through  all  the  deposition  duration  and  a  single  monolayer  of  Gr  uniformly 
covers  the  H-terminated  SiC  substrate.  The  H-Gr  domain  is  well  identified  by  STM 
observations  that  reveal  only  the  Gr  atomic  cell.  LEED  and  XPS  analyses  confirm  the  STM 
observations.  

When  reducing  the  H2  ratio,  the  proportion  of  H-Gr  decreases  and  we  observe  the 
simultaneous presence of H-Gr and (6X6)Gr domains on juxtaposed terraces. To the best of 
our knowledge, such morphology has never been observed before.  We will consider below 
the three hypotheses that can explain this morphology: (i) the simultaneous formation of the 
two domains; (ii) hydrogen intercalation below certain part of the (6x6) domain; (iii) partial 
desorption  of  H  below  the  H-Gr  domain.  Thanks  to  the  systematic  observations  of  the 
domains and of their boundaries, we can rule out the two first hypotheses and we claim that 
the  (6x6)Gr  domains  are  formed  by  the  partial  desorption  of  H  accompanied  by  the 
reconstruction of (6x6) unit cells. This mechanism is supported by important aspects of the 
surface: first, the two juxtaposed domains have large sizes that are not compatible with the 
concomitant formation of the two domains in homogeneous atmosphere. Second, the step 
edges  between  H-Gr  and  (6x6)Gr  domains  have  mostly  armchair  orientation,  which  is  the 
predominant stable configuration and the signature of passivated H-Gr edges 82. The stability 
of armchair step edge configuration in presence of hydrogen was explained by both the lower 
energy of armchair edge (due to triple bonds in the “armrests” while zigzag edges end with 
strong and expensive dangling bonds) and the weak adsorption of H for armchair (4.36 eV) 
compared  to  zigzag  (5.36  eV)  which  stems  from  the  triple  bonds  in  the  armchair  edge.  In 
addition, the (6x6) kinks generally observed along the steps confirm the transformation from 

14 

 
one  domain  to  another,  by  hopping  of  (6x6)  unit  cells,  which  is  well  consistent  with  H-
desorption  mechanism  accompanied  by  reconstruction  of  (6x6)  unit  cells.  Third,  we  have 
proven that only one H-Gr monolayer is formed, while the intercalation of H below the (6x6)Gr 
produces two layers of Gr. This confirms that H-Gr is formed first and straight on H-passivated 
SiC and not on (6x6)Gr. At last, several observations evidence the presence of (6x6)Gr areas 
fully surrounded by H-Gr domains (see figure 6a for instance). Such a situation can only be 
explained by the desorption of H from defects on the H-Gr terraces, resulting in the formation 
of local areas of (6x6)Gr. In presence of C atmosphere, the (6x6) buffer layer is immediately 
covered by 1ML Gr for thermodynamic stability purpose. 

When  reducing  further  H2/Ar  ratio,  formation  of  H-Gr  is  very  unlikely.  It  is  either  totally 
inhibited  or  H-Gr  is rapidly converted  into (6x6)Gr by H- desorption (due to the lack  of H2 
molecules) and Gr coverage. The surface exhibits a single (6x6) domain which is well identified 
by the superimposition of the two structures ((6x6) reconstruction and Gr atomic cell) on STM 
images. LEED and XPS analyses also confirm the presence of a unique (6x6)Gr domain. It is 
worth  noting  that  during  the  cooling  stage  the  adsorption  of  hydrogen  atom  from  H2 
molecules is not  favoured due to the cost of H2 dissociation energy, unless the adsorption 
process should be even more complicated. 

CONCLUSIONS 

By  a  combined  study  using  a  well-controlled  growth  process  and  systematic  and  careful 
STM/XPS/LEED  analyses,  we  have  identified  the  major  steps  of  the  complex  Gr  growth 
mechanism in presence of H2, Ar and C3H8. For the first time, we have shown that the quasi-
equilibrium growth process is self-limited and forms a single graphene layer independent of 
the growth duration. The first stage is the direct growth of a full hydrogenated graphene (H-
Gr) over the full wafer scale. Depending on the H2 flux, it eventually transforms into graphene 
on (6√3 × 6√3)R30°  buffer layer ((6x6)Gr) by H-desorption from either step edges or defects 
on the terraces of 6H-SiC(0001) substrate. Such CVD growth mechanism creates coexisting 
domains of the two surface structures, which are not distinguishable by AFM observations. It 
is also a unique process to produce whole layers of hydrogenated graphene or of graphene 
on buffer layer. It is worth noting that in these conditions, the step edges have an armchair 
configuration.  This  could  have  major  impacts,  not  only  from  the  viewpoint  of  potential 
applications  (since  H-passivated  armchair  edges  have  strong  influence  on  the  electronic 
structure  of  Gr)  but  also  for  fundamental  science.  We  also  show  a  robust  and  general 
procedure based on XPS data which allows to realistically quantify the proportions of H-Gr 
and  (6x6)Gr  domains  of  a  Gr  film  synthetized  in  any  experimental  conditions.  Such 
proportions are of crucial importance for the growth of subsequent layers on top of graphene. 
We  have  achieved  a  precise  identification  of  new  Gr  configurations,  which  provides  the 
groundwork for the use of Gr as template layer for Van der Waals heteroepitaxy.

METHODS 

   Graphene samples were grown on Si-terminated face of nominally on-axis Silicon Carbide 
6H-SiC(0001) by CVD in a hot wall horizontal growth chamber. The silicon carbide substrates 
(6H-SiC)  are  on-axis  n-doped  (nitrogen)  2’’  wafers  with  typical  thickness  of  ~350µm  from 
Tankeblue. Typical residual offcuts are between 0.05 and 0.2° towards [1–100] direction, as 
deduced from AFM measurements on annealed substrates under H2 56. Before introduction 
into  the  growth  chamber,  the  substrates  are  cut  into  1×1cm²  pieces  and  then  chemically 
cleaned  with  isopropanol.  Graphene  (Gr)  deposition  was  carried  out  in  a  horizontal  CVD 
reactor allowing a homogeneous and reproducible deposition of graphene on the substrates, 
at a pressure of 800 mbar s using a gas mixture of propane (C3H8) as the carbon source, and 
hydrogen (H2) and argon (Ar) as the carrier gases. Growth temperature was varied between 
1550 and 1650 °C 56 and durations between 5 and 15 minutes. The H2 flow ratio (H2 flow / 
total flow) was varied between 9% and 42%. The propane flow ratio  was 0.04% or 0.08%. 
During the temperature ramp to reach the growth temperature and during the cooling down, 
only the carrier gases (H2+ Ar) were introduced into the growth chamber. The cooling down 
to room temperature begin at a rate about 4°C/min.   

In this study we report the results obtained on three representative samples obtained with 
different H2 flow ratios: A) 9%, B) 33% and C) 42%. The other experimental conditions listed 
in  Table  1,  are  expected  to  have  almost  no  influence  on  the  Gr/substrate  interactions  as 
already reported.

   Morphological characterization of the samples was investigated by near field microscopy: 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode in air using Silicon tip and scanning tunnelling 
microscopy (STM) using electrochemically etched tungsten tips in UHV conditions. The UHV 
chamber  was  equipped  with  low  energy  electron  diffraction  (LEED),  monochromatic  X-ray 

16 

 
 
 
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and STM (Omicron). STM observations were carried out at 
room temperature using constant current mode with It = 0.3 nA and Vt - between 0.4 and 1.5 
V. A photon energy of 1486.6 eV (Al-Ka) for XPS measurements was used. The photoelectrons 
are analysed with an Omicron EA 125 energy analyser. AFM and STM data were analysed by 
WSxM  83 and ImageJ software. The XPS spectra were fitted using CasaXPS software. Cross-
section transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  samples were prepared using a FEI Helios 
600 Dual Beam Ga+ focus ion beam (FIB). High resolution TEM (HR-TEM) observations were 
performed using a FEI Titan 80-300 Cs corrected microscope, operating at 200 keV.
