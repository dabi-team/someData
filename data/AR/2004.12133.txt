Abstract

In a systematic search for the QCD critical point in nuclear collisions, at
the CERN SPS, it was found that intermittency measurements in the freeze-
out state of central Si + Si collisions, at the maximum SPS energy, provide
us with an indication of sizeable critical ﬂuctuations. Also, rather recently,
a weaker eﬀect was traced in preliminary data of the Ar + Sc reaction for
10 − 20% most central collisions at (approximately) the same energy. How-
ever, the uncertainties in the analysis and the limitations of the experimental
event statistics make the interpretation of the above measurements (NA49,
NA61/SHINE) rather inconclusive, inviting for a further, phenomenological
investigation with complementary tools and theoretical ideas. To this end,
in the present work, we employ intermittency techniques within a model-
independent analysis scheme (AMIAS), a novel method from Data Science
[1], in order to produce unbiased results for the parameters of the power-
laws and in particular for the associated power-law exponent (intermittency

1. Introduction

During the last decade (2010-2020) a systematic search for QCD criti-
cal ﬂuctuations was performed at the CERN SPS (NA49, NA61/SHINE) in
measurements of intermittency in A + A collisions [2, 3, 4]. The aim was to
capture critical ﬂuctuations when the chemical freeze out of a particular col-
lision comes close to the critical end point in the QCD phase diagram. This
picture relies upon the experimental fact that chemical freeze out in A + A
collisions is a state in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, universal ﬂuctua-
tions at the critical point, dependent on the static critical exponents, may, in
principle, be revealed. In fact, intermittency in transverse momentum space,
linked to the order parameter of the critical point (σ-ﬁeld simulated by π+π−
pairs or net-baryon number) is a manifestation of ﬁnite size scaling, a funda-
mental property of critical systems [5, 6]. The formulation of intermittency
along these lines leads to the following prediction at the critical point, for
the two choices of the order parameter [7, 8]:

In the successor to NA49, the SPS-NA61/SHINE experiment, measure-
ments of proton intermittency in the reactions Be + Be, Ar + Sc at maximum
SPS energy (
sN N = 16.8 GeV) lead to the following preliminary results
[4, 10, 11]: there is no intermittency eﬀect either in Be + Be, or in Ar + Sc
for extremely central collisions (0 − 5% most central) of the Ar + Sc reaction.
However, a non zero eﬀect was traced in peripherality 10 − 20% of the same
reaction, [4, 11] reﬂecting possibly a small increase of freeze-out temperature
with increasing peripherality due to a decrease of the ﬁreball size [12, 13],
bringing, presumably, the system closer to the critical region. Nevertheless,
the interpretation of this result remains inconclusive since no reliable estimate
of the exponent φ(b)
can be ﬁxed, mainly due to the uncertainties induced
2
by correlated bins and large statistical errors in the intermittency treatment
[11, 14]. As a result, we notice that there exists a valuable compilation of
SPS intermittency measurements which show a critical activity in the region
of nuclear sizes A=30-40 at the maximum SPS energy of various A + A col-
lisions, inconclusively interpretable due to the aforementioned uncertainties.
In the present work, we make an attempt to understand the signiﬁcance of
these measurements in a phenomenological treatment, with complementary
tools and theoretical ideas.

We employ a model-independent analysis scheme (AMIAS) in order to
produce unbiased results for the parameters of the power laws and overcome
the obstacle of correlated bins in the intermittency treatment [1, 14]. We also
make use of the Ising-QCD partition function, close to the critical point [6],
in order to discuss the location of the singularity and interpret the measure-
ments in Ar + Sc at diﬀerent centralities. Our description, along these lines,
is organized as follows: In section 2, the general principles of the AMIAS
method are presented, emphasizing the treatment of correlated data. In sec-
tion 3, the AMIAS results for the intermittency parameters, limited to the
measurements in Si + Si (0 − 12%) and Ar + Sc for varying centralities, are
discussed. Also, the plot of φ2 versus Nw (number of wounded nucleons) is
constructed [15], illustrating the approach of NA61/SHINE freeze-out states,

3

towards the critical point. In section 4, the location of the SPS freeze-out
states (NA49, NA61/SHINE) in the phase diagram is investigated with re-
spect to the critical region. In particular, it is examined whether the AMIAS
intermittent solutions are accommodated within the critical region or re-
main outside but close to the boundaries. This study becomes instrumental
for the experimental estimate of the size of the critical region. Theoretically,
the Ising-QCD partition function predicts a critical region that is a few MeV
wide along the chemical potential direction [6]. Finally in section 5, our
results and conclusions are summarized.

2. The AMIAS method

The AMIAS method [1, 16] has been developed in order to extract physi-
cal information from experimental or simulated data with the highest possible
precision and in an unbiased way. It is based on statistical concepts and is
able to handle a rather large number of parameters using Monte Carlo tech-
niques. The method requires the deﬁnition of a theory or model which links
the parameters to be determined in an explicit way with the data. Although
AMIAS is well suited to resolve physical parameters from data where the
underlying model cannot be inverted, it can equally well address simple ﬁt
cases with noisy data. Recently, AMIAS has been successfully applied in
the analysis of pion photoproduction data for the extraction of the multi-
pole excitation amplitudes [17] as well as in lattice QCD investigations for
Tetraquark interpolating ﬁelds [18].

For a given set of parameters that deﬁnes the physical model, the principal
idea behind AMIAS is that any arbitrary value assigned to the parameters
constitutes a possible solution. Each of these solutions is weighted with
a probability value retrieved out of the data set by a cost function. The
information obtained from the given set of data is a Probability Density
Function (PDF) assigned to each of the model parameters. The central
values of the parameters and their uncertainties are therefore the expectation
values and the standard deviations of the corresponding PDFs. The sampling
method used in AMIAS allows all ﬁt parameters to randomly vary and to
yield solutions with all allowed values, including the insensitive exponential
terms.

In the present work our aim is to use the AMIAS protocol for the de-
tection of power-law behaviour in the density-density correlation function
of protons in transverse momentum space for small transverse momentum

4

diﬀerences. This scenario is expected to be realized in protons produced
in the central rapidity region in ion collisions, whenever the produced ﬁre-
ball freezes-out at the thermodynamic conditions (baryochemical potential,
In fact, this eﬀect is the mo-

mentum space counterpart of ﬁnite size scaling in conﬁguration space [19]
revealed through the Fourier transform of the real space density-density cor-
relation function [20]. The relevant information is contained in the second
order factorial moment F2 counting the, properly normalized, mean number
of proton pairs per transverse momentum space cell [21]. A given transverse
momentum domain is partitioned into M 2 cells and F2 is calculated for dif-
ferent values of M . The presence of power-law density-density correlations
is reﬂected in the function F2(M ) which in this case behaves, in the limit
of large M , as ∼ M 2φ2 where φ2 is the intermittency index and the associ-
ated physical scaling eﬀect is characterized as intermittency. In experimental
data, the intermittency eﬀect may be masked by the presence of noise, i.e.
proton pairs which do not follow a power-law, or particles misidentiﬁed as
protons. In addition, the fact that the values of F2(M ) for diﬀerent M s are
correlated raises the question how these correlations aﬀect the corresponding
errors which are unavoidably present due to ﬁnite statistics. Before applying
AMIAS to experimental data in the next section, we demonstrate here its
power to overcome these diﬃculties.

For this purpose, we use a modiﬁed version of the Critical Monte-Carlo
(CMC) event generator [22, 23] suited for simulating protons in transverse
momentum space; simulated protons are produced through a truncated L´evy
walk process to exhibit density-density correlations mimicking those origi-
nating from a ﬁreball freezing out at the QCD critical point. The power-law
exponent is chosen to describe correlations characterizing a critical system in
the 3d-Ising universality class; associated intermittency index has the value
φ2 = 5
6 [8]. Furthermore, the algorithm can be parametrized [10] to produce
an exponential one-particle proton pT distribution and a Poissonian per-event
proton multiplicity distribution, the values of which can be plugged in; ﬁ-
nally, truncated L´evy walk bounds can be ﬁne-tuned in order to produce
critical density-density correlations within the desired scales.

A number of uncorrelated proton momenta drawn from a one-particle pT
distribution are interspersed among the critical protons at an adjustable per-
centage. These simulate the eﬀect of non-critical background contamination
on the critical signal.

In the following text, and unless stated otherwise, proton intermittency

analysis of F2(M ) is applied within a rectangular region in transverse momen-
tum space: −1.5 ≤ px, py ≤ 1.5 GeV/c. The number M of one-dimensional
bins in momentum space ranges from 1 to 150. The power-law ﬁt for the
intermittency index φ2 is performed in the M 2 ∈ [103, 104], or equivalently
the M ∈ [32, 100], range.

For our AMIAS test, we generate sets of ∼ 400K proton events with
the characteristics of the NA61/SHINE Ar + Sc 10 − 20% most central data
sN N = 16.8 GeV). Average pro-
set at 150A GeV/c beam momentum (
ton multiplicity per event is adjusted to ∼ 2.5, with a standard deviation
of ∼ 1.4. Critical proton tracks are contaminated with 99.3% noise (0.7%
critical component). This huge noise masks the underlying power-law be-
haviour at the level of F2(M ). As shown in [3] in this regime, the power-law
component is revealed in the correlator ∆F2(M ) ≡ F2,data(M ) − F2,mixed(M ),
accounting for the subtraction of the background simulated by mixed events,
F2,mixed(M ). This behavior is evident in Fig.1 (left), where the pure and
background-diluted CMC factorial moments are shown in double logarith-
mic scale: the correlator ∆F2(M ) retains the critical slope of the pure CMC
F2(M ), even though its values are reduced by orders of magnitude compared
to pure CMC. Fig.1 (right) shows ∆F2(M ) for the same set of events, plot-
ted against the distribution of ∆F2(M ) values for a total of 400 independent
CMC sets, under the same conditions (linear scale is used to accommodate
negative values). One observes that the original sample is typical, falling
mostly within the central yellow band roughly corresponding to 1σ, whereas
a minority of samples have either lower or higher slopes. However, in itself
the distribution of ∆F2(M ) values does not give a complete picture of the
power-law behaviour of moments due to the role of bin correlations.

The above generated sets have been analyzed with the AMIAS method. A
total of 400 independent iterations with 150 data points each are assembled in
a grand examination set. The function used to ﬁt the data had the following
analytical form

where a0 and φ2 are the two ﬁt parameters. The uniform sampling method
has been applied in the Monte-Carlo technique choosing appropriate variation
range for both parameters. Millions of possible solutions are selected by
eliminating extreme values with the help of a χ2-cut. The ﬁnal PDF solutions
for the ﬁt parameters are constructed in the usual way by weighting each

erated CMC data sets with the AMIAS solution extracted from the central

SHINE experiments.

3. Intermittent ﬂuctuations in SPS (CERN)

In this section we employ AMIAS to estimate the intermittency index
φ2 based on the NA61/SHINE (CERN, SPS) preliminary measurements of
the proton transverse momentum space correlator ∆F2 in Ar + Sc collisions
at 150A GeV/c beam momentum for diﬀerent peripheralities in the range
0 − 20% [11]. Our goal is to explore how the associated φ2 distribution,
determined by AMIAS, depends on peripherality of the collisions. As men-
tioned also in the Introduction, such a study is twofold motivated:

• Freeze-out states produced in Ar + Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c beam
momentum are expected to lie, in the baryochemical potential (µB) and
temperature (T ) plane, relatively close to (µB,Si, TSi), parametrizing
the freeze-out state produced in central Si + Si collisions at 158A GeV/c
(NA49 experiment at CERN-SPS). In the latter system intermittent
ﬂuctuations with critical characteristics have been observed [2, 3].

• The theoretical prediction that the critical region is very narrow in
(µB, T ) plane [19], implies that the neighbourhood of (µB,Si, TSi) should
be explored with small steps in µB and T . Such a ﬁne search can be
realized in a suitable scan, employing freeze-out states of Ar + Sc colli-
sions at 150A GeV/c at diﬀerent peripheralities. This is due to the fact
that there is experimental evidence as well as theoretical understand-
ing [12, 13] that changes in the peripherality inﬂuence the freeze-out
conditions (µB, T ) in a prescribed mild manner.

In fact it is expected that more peripheral Ar + Sc collisions can approach the
freeze-out conditions of central Si + Si collisions at similar energy. Unfortu-
nately, experimental limitations restrict the range of peripherality variation

in diﬀerent peripherality zones of increasing resolution. Starting from the
coarsest scale 0 − 20%, the 0 − 20% zone is subsequently partitioned into two
non-overlapping intervals of 10% width, i.e. 0 − 10% and 10 − 20%, and the
resolution is further increased though a subdivision into four non-overlapping
intervals of 5% width each: 0 − 5%, 5 − 10%, 10 − 15% and 15 − 20% pro-

mittency index φ2 for each of the cases described above. The results of
this analysis are presented in two ﬁgures. In Fig. 5(a-d) we present the φ2-
distribution for the corresponding cases for ∆F2 shown in Fig. 4(a-d) while
in Fig. 6(a-c) we show the φ2-distribution corresponding to the second set

and 5 − 10%) while a clear intemittency eﬀect, expressed by a non-vanishing
mean φ2 value and a standard deviation suﬃciently small to exclude the

φ2 ≤ 0 region, is observed in the peripherality bin 10 − 20%, as well as
its subdivisions 10 − 15% and 15 − 20%, shown in Figs. 5(a-d). The mean
value (cid:104)φ2(cid:105) is slightly increased in the 15 − 20% as compared to that in the
10 − 15% peripherality interval. On average, in the 0 − 20% zone, a small
but certainly non-vanishing intermittency eﬀect is sustained. These results
are compatible with a tendency of the Ar + Sc freeze-out state to approach
the Si + Si freeze-out state with increasing peripherality. This behaviour was
theoretically foreseen in [19].

For completeness we have used AMIAS to determine the distribution of
the intermittency index φ2 also for the Si + Si system analysed in detail in
[3]. In Fig. 7a we show the correlator - for protons in transverse momentum

measured in the NA49 experiment (SPS, CERN), while in Fig. 7b, we display
the φ2 distribution obtained with AMIAS. For consistency, we have used in
AMIAS the same ﬁtted M 2-range as in [3], M 2 ∈ [6000, 22500]. The overall
form of the distribution is compatible with the result published in [3]. The
advantage of the AMIAS method is that it leads to a signiﬁcantly narrower
distribution than that obtained by applying the bootstrap method [24, 25]
to φ2 ﬁts, as detailed in [3].

A transparent interpretation of the results shown in Figs. (5-7) is possible
if one uses the number of wounded nucleons Nw for the characterization of
the freeze-out states associated with each peripherality bin.

The mean number of wounded nucleons in each bin of Ar + Sc collisions
is estimated by means of a geometrical Glauber simulation [26]. The Ar
nuclear density proﬁle is obtained from the Fourier-Bessel expansion of the
nuclear charge density [27] while the Sc proﬁle is taken as a Saxon-Woods
distribution with half density and surface thickness terms taken as 0.542 fm
and 3.77 fm, respectively [27, 28]. The nucleon-nucleon cross-section at this
energy is taken as 31.42 mb in agreement with literature [29]. In order to
match the speciﬁc NA61/SHINE centrality selection based on the energy
deposit in a forward calorimeter [30], the simulated centrality samples are
deﬁned by the energy of projectile (Ar) spectator nucleons. The potential
inﬂuence of the additional energy deposit by produced charged particles in

it is included in the uncertainty estimated for our calculation, presented in

It is interesting to plot the intermittency index φ2, calculated with AMIAS,
as a function of the number of wounded nucleons, similarly to the plot pre-
sented in [15] using φ2-values obtained through ordinary ﬁtting procedure. In
Fig. 8 we show such a plot including only systems with Nw < 55. Since Nw is
a quantity related to the eﬀective size of the produced ﬁreball, it is expected
to depend smoothly on the freeze-out temperature T [32]. We clearly observe
the tendency of the most peripheral Ar + Sc freeze-out states to approach
the Si + Si freeze-out state since Nw is decreasing with increasing peripher-
ality. It is remarkable that, at the same time, the intermittency index φ2
increases too, indicating the proximity to the critical region. Clearly the φ2
value for the freeze-out state associated with the most peripheral Ar + Sc
collisions is still far from the critical value (0.41 compared to 0.83) indicating
that this system has not entered yet into the critical region [19]. Further-
more, the absence of an intermittency eﬀect in the C + C (central collisions
at 158A GeV/c, NA49) [3] and Be + Be (central collisions at 150A GeV/c,
NA61/SHINE preliminary) [10] systems with Nw,C ≈ 14 < Nw,Si ≈ 37 [32],

15

implies the formation of a maximum located close to Nw = Nw,Si in the
φ2(Nw) function. Unfortunately, due to very low proton multiplicity and in-
suﬃcient statistics the φ2 value for Be + Be is indeterminable. Nevertheless,
the overall picture provides us with a rough estimation of the size of the
critical region quantiﬁed by the diﬀerences |φ2 − 5
6| and |Nw − Nw,Si|. A more
detailed representation of the critical region and its surroundings requires ad-
ditional theoretical tools and it will be presented in the next section. There
we will show that, in the immediate neighbourhood of the critical point, the
quantities φ2 and Nw form an almost cartesian coordinate system, allowing
an alternative parametrization of the QCD phase diagram in this region.

4. Probing the QCD critical region

In this section we exploit the AMIAS results of the previous section to
construct a phase diagram of the critical region and its surroundings along

function Z, derived in [6], to describe the net-baryon density and its ﬂuctu-
ations close to the critical point. To be self-contained, we repeat here the
deﬁnition of Z:

ical temperature Tcr. The dimensionless variable L quantiﬁes the size of
the considered baryonic system. The universal couplings g4 = 0.97 ± 0.02,
g6 = 2.05 ± 0.15 are calculated in [33] while ˆm = βcm is related to the

T < Tcr where the corresponding amplitude is ξ0,−. Notice that the ratio
ξ0,+
is ﬁxed and approximately equal to 2 in the 3d-Ising universality class.
ξ0,−
Finally, ζ = e(µB−µB,cr)βc represents the fugacity in the grand canonical en-
semble with µB,cr the critical baryochemical potential. As explained in [19]
Eq. (2) provides a valid thermodynamic description of the critical ﬂuid in
the neighbourhood of the critical point where hadronic and quark phases are
indiscernible. Furthermore, the partition function (2) reproduces accurately
scaling, critical exponents, of the 3d Ising
all the critical properties, i.e.
system [34]. It can be used to derive scaling laws of the form:

(cid:104)N k(cid:105) ∼ Lkq, k = 1, 2, ...

(3)

expressing the ﬁnite size scaling properties of the critical ﬂuid [19]. For the
3d-Ising model the power-law exponent is q ≈ 5
6. In fact, the partition func-
tion (2) enables also the description of the baryonic ﬂuid for thermodynamic
conditions close, but at a distance from the critical point (µB,cr, Tcr). In such
a case, scaling laws of the form in Eq. (3) are still approximately valid, how-
ever the exponent q is modiﬁed to ˜q varying in the range [0, 5
6, 1]. Then,
the diﬀerence |˜q − 5
6| provides a measure for the distance from the critical
baryochemical potential value µc, as shown in [19]. Of course, far from the
critical point the validity of the partition function Z in (2) breaks down. The

6) or ( 5

17

importance of the power-law exponent ˜q is that it can be measured in ion
collision experiments through intermittency analysis in transverse momen-
tum space. Within this framework, power-law behaviour of the correlator
∆F2(M ) ∼ M 2φ2 as a function of the number of cells M in transverse mo-
mentum space partitioning (intermittency eﬀect), is a manifestation of the
ﬁnite-size scaling (3) in conﬁguration space, both eﬀects related to each other
through a Fourier transform [20]. As a consequence the intermittency index
φ2 coincides with the ﬁnite-size scaling exponent q (or more general ˜q).

For the construction of the phase diagram we will use two basic ingre-
dients: (i) the φ2 values calculated with AMIAS and (ii) the number of
wounded nucleons Nw calculated with a geometrical Glauber model simu-
lation [26]. For both quantities we will use their central values, given in
Table 1, neglecting the associated errors. However, the essentials of our
treatment, contained in the methodological approach, are in general valid
independently of this choice. Initially the phase diagram will be presented in
the reduced variables ln ζ (reduced baryochemical potential) and t (reduced
temperature), however, as we will see in the following, close to the critical
point the quantities φ2 and Nw play a similar role.

Our strategy is as follows:

• Firstly we determine the curves φ2(ln ζ, t) = Ci with i = 1, 2..., 5 and
Ci constant values taken from the last column in Table 1 in increasing
order. We consider only the cases with Ci > 0.

• Subsequently we construct the corresponding Nw(ln ζ, t) = ci curves
(with i = 1, .., 5) where the ci values are taken from the third column
in Table 1.

• The intersections of these families of lines determine the location of the

corresponding freeze-out states in the (ln ζ, t) plane.

To achieve the ﬁrst task, we employ Eq. (2) for the calculation of the
function (cid:104)N (cid:105)(L) at each point of a 401 × 401 grid in the (ln ζ, t) plane. The
grid covers the region ln ζ ∈ [−0.12, 0.12] and t ∈ [−0.2, 0.2]. The variable
L, being the ratio of the volume of the entire system (ﬁreball) to the volume
of a single nucleon, varies in the range 30 ≤ L ≤ 700, corresponding to
nuclei with linear size from 3 to 9 fm. This range of L values covers all
experimentally accessible cases from small to medium size nuclei in NA49
and NA61/SHINE experiments.

18

We perform a linear ﬁt in the function ln(cid:104)N (cid:105)(ln L) at each point of the
(ln ζ, t) grid and we check its validity with the regression coeﬃcient R2 setting
the constraint R2 ≥ 70% for the characterization as a power-law. The slope
parameter of this ﬁt provides us the φ2-value at each grid point. The set
of (ln ζ, t) points leading to the same φ2 value, within a ±10−3-deviation,
determines the curve with constant φ2 in the (ln ζ, t) plane.

The results of this calculation are shown in Fig. 9a. The red lines in this
plot correspond to φ2 = 0.75 (left) and φ2 = 1 (right) determining the borders
of the critical region (red shaded area), according to the deﬁnition given in [6].
The blue curve is associated with the φ2 value for the Si + Si system (φ2,Si =
0.92) while the green curves correspond to the φ2 values found for Ar + Sc in
the peripherality zones 10 − 20%, 10 − 15% and 15 − 20%, while the orange
curve displays the φ2 = 0.16 curve (Ar + Sc, peripherality 0 − 20%). For
all cases, a piecewise linear description of the φ2(ln ζ, t) = constant curve
is a good approximation. Notice, that all curves of constant φ2-values in
Fig. 9a, being expressed in reduced variables, do not depend on the speciﬁc
(µB,cr, Tcr)-values. Thus, the displayed pattern is universal, characterizing
the 3d Ising class.

In particular, the information contained in the blue curve in Fig. 9a can
be further exploited, when combined with the results plotted in Fig. 8, as well
as the data for the freeze-out baryochemical potential µB,Si and temperature
TSi of the Si + Si system, estimated with the statistical hadronization model
in [12].
In fact, it allows the determination of the critical baryochemical
potential µB,cr as a function of the critical temperature Tcr, following the
line of thought given below:

• Fig. 8 dictates that the critical temperature is slightly below the freeze-
out temperature of the Si + Si system, since the function T (Nw) is
decreasing [12, 13]. This means that the freeze-out state of Si + Si
must lie on the upper branch of the blue curve in Fig. 9a where tSi =
TSi−Tcr
Tcr

> 0.

• The upper branch of the blue curve in Fig. 9a can be described by the

line:

t = aSi ln ζ + bSi

;

aSi = 47.52 ; bSi = −0.36

(4)

obtained by ﬁtting.

• For given µB,Si and TSi, equation (4) provides a relation between µB,cr

19

and Tcr:

(1 + bSi)Tcr − TSi
aSi
taking into account that ln ζSi = µB,Si−µB,cr

µB,cr = µB,Si +

.

kBTcr

(5)

• In [12] it is found that µB,Si = 260 ± 17.9 MeV and TSi = 162.2 ±
7.9 MeV. Using the central values (µB,Si, TSi) = (260, 162.2) MeV and
assuming Tcr = 162 MeV, we ﬁnd µB,cr = 258.8 MeV. Although this is
an indicative result obtained neglecting errors, the described procedure
can be used for any set of {µB,Si, TSi, Tcr} values to determine µB,cr.
Notice that the choice Tcr = 162 MeV is compatible with some recent
Lattice QCD results [35].

In the second step we place the curves Nw(ln ζ, t) = ci (i = 1, .., 5) on
the (ln ζ, t)-plane. We assume, therefore, a lowest order expansion of the
function Nw(ln ζ, t) around (ln ζSi, tSi) of the form:

Nw(ln ζ, t) = Nw(ln ζSi, tSi) + γt(t − tSi) + γζ(ln ζ − ln ζSi)

(6)

with Nw(ln ζSi, tSi) = 37 (see Table 1) and γt, γζ constants to be determined.
Notice that, according to Fig. 8 (and Table 1), the number of wounded
nucleons Nw,cr at the critical point (ln ζcr, tcr) = (0, 0) is bounded in the range
37 ≤ Nw,cr < 42.4. Therefore it is convenient, if possible, to parametrize the
constants γt and γζ in Eq. (6) in terms of Nw,cr. To this end, we use the
freeze-out state (ln ζC, tC) formed in central C + C collisions at 158A GeV/c
(NA49, CERN), which lies close enough to the Si + Si freeze-out state [12]
to obey Eq. (6). We obtain the system of equations:

Nw,cr = Nw,Si − γttSi − γζ ln ζSi
Nw,C = Nw,Si + γt(tC − tSi) + γζ(ln ζC − ln ζSi)

(7a)
(7b)

with Nw,Si = Nw(ln ζSi, tSi) and Nw,C = Nw(ln ζC, tC) respectively. Eqs. (7a,7b)
can be solved for γt and γζ yielding:

γt =

γζ =

Nw,Si − Nw,cr − γζ ln ζSi
tSi

tSi(Nw,C − Nw,Si) + (tC − tSi)(Nw,cr − Nw,Si)
tSi(ln ζC − ln ζSi) − ln ζSi(tC − tSi)

(8a)

(8b)

20

In Eqs. (8a,8b) Nw,Si and Nw,C are given in [32] while tSi, ln ζSi, tC and ln ζC
are determined by the values of TSi, µB,Si, TC and µB,C given in [12] provided
that Tcr and µB,cr are known. In consistency with the analysis in the ﬁrst
step we will use only the central values of [12] for TSi, µB,Si, TC and µB,C
(neglecting errors).

Furthermore, µB,cr can be expressed in terms of Tcr via Eq. (5). Thus, the
only unknown parameters are Tcr and Nw,cr. Their values determine the lines
Nw = constant. In Fig. 9a we show as an example the line Nw = 37 (dotted
blue) assuming Tcr = 156 MeV and Nw,cr = 39.5. According to Table 1 this
line corresponds to the Si + Si system. The intersection of this line with the
curve φ2 = 0.92 determines the location of the Si + Si freeze-out state in the
(ln ζ, t) plane. The blue arrow is used to clarify this. In a similar way we can
ﬁnd the locations of the freeze-out states for the Ar + Sc systems at diﬀerent
peripheralities. They depend strongly on the chosen values Tcr and Nw,cr.
Varying Tcr and Nw,cr the slope − γζ
of the lines Nw = constant changes.
γt
A more quantitative description of this dependence is displayed in Fig. 9b
where we plot − γζ
as a function of Nw,cr for diﬀerent values of Tcr. We
γt
observe that this dependence becomes smoother, in the sense that the slope
− γζ
becomes smaller, for Tcr = 162 MeV. In the following considerations we
γt
will exclusively use this value for the critical temperature. With this choice,
the data used to calculate the constants γt and γζ get the values summarized
in Table 2.

The entries of Table 2 determine the constants γt, γζ in terms of Nw,cr

as:

γt = −4833.9 + 100.8Nw,cr

;

γζ = 5631.9 − 147.4Nw,cr

(9)

Then, it is straightforward to obtain the lines of constant value of Nw in the
(ln ζ, t) plane using Eq. (6), after choosing Nw,cr ∈ [37, 42.4).

Especially interesting, from the phenomenological point of view, is the
case where Nw is independent of ln ζ. Such a behaviour is also suggested by
experimental data [12, 13]. Within our analysis, this scenario implies that

21

γζ in Eq. (8b) vanishes, leading to the condition:

Nw,cr = Nw,Si +

(TSi − Tcr)(Nw,Si − Nw,C)
TC − TSi

(10)

which connects the critical temperature Tcr with the number of wounded
nucleons at the critical point Nw,cr. For Tcr = 162 MeV we ﬁnd, using
Eq. (10), Nw,cr = 38.2. Using this value for Nw,cr we show in Fig. 9c the
critical region and its neighbourhood in the (ln ζ, φ2)-plane. The location
of the Ar + Sc freeze-out states for diﬀerent peripheralities (NA61/SHINE
experiment) in the interval 10 − 20% is shown by the green circles in this
plot. The blue star displays the location of the Si + Si freeze-out state, while,
for completeness, we include in the graph also the C + C freeze-out state
(black star), both measured in NA49 experiment. The red circle indicates the
location of the critical point. Finally the orange cross presents the freeze-out
state of Ar + Sc in 0 − 20% peripherality interval. It is remarkable that the
freeze-out states of the diﬀerent systems are concentrated close to the critical
point along the reduced temperature axis. At this scale the φ2 = constant
curves appear as almost vertical lines forming, together with the horizontal
Nw = constant (dotted coloured) lines a cartesian coordinate system for the
description of the critical region and its neighbourhood.

Within this parametrization a nice interpretation is possible: the number
of wounded nucleons Nw deﬁnes the temperature of a freeze-out state within
and close to the critical region while the intermittency index φ2 deﬁnes the
corresponding baryochemical potential. As already discussed, small changes
in the Tcr and in the TSi, µB,Si, TC, µB,C values will not alter the form of the
critical neighbourhood shown in Fig. 9c since the plot is in relative (reduced)
coordinates with respect to the critical point. Thus, similarly to Fig. 9a,
also Fig. 9c is a rather universal result. It indicates clearly the proximity to
the critical region of the peripheral Ar + Sc collisions. However, within the
peripherality range 0 − 20%, allowed by the NA61/SHINE experiment, the
recorded freeze-out states are still at a distance from the critical region and
therefore the observed intermittency eﬀect [11] can not be characterized as
critical. Nevertheless, together with NA49 intermittency results [2, 3], the
NA61/SHINE intermittency analysis provides a close frame of the critical
region.

5. Summary and conclusions

Employing the AMIAS method to extract the distributions of the inter-
mittency index φ2 from the preliminary NA61/SHINE results for the proton
correlator ∆F2(M ) in transverse momentum space of the Ar + Sc system
(150A GeV/c beam momentum) at diﬀerent peripheralities [11], we demon-
strate the presence of a non-vanishing intermittency eﬀect in the 10 − 20%
peripherality interval. The AMIAS method of analysis is also applied to
the ∆F2(M ) measurement in Si + Si central collisions (0 − 12% peripheral-
ity) at 158A GeV/c by the NA49 experiment [3], verifying the presence of
critical ﬂuctuations in this system. The AMIAS results for φ2, combined
with an estimation of the corresponding number of wounded nucleons Nw
for each considered freeze-out state, allow the mapping of the critical region
and its neighbourhood in the reduced baryochemical-temperature plane, in
terms of the quantities φ2 and Nw. This mapping indicates that the pre-
liminary NA61/SHINE intermittency results are fully compatible with the
corresponding NA49 measurements reﬂecting transparently the approach of
the Ar + Sc freeze-out states towards the critical region with increasing pe-
ripherality. Our analysis provides strong constraints on the location of the
critical region and it may be used as an invaluable guide in the forthcoming
experimental searches for the QCD critical point.
