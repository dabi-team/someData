ABSTRACT

The pricing of ﬁnancial derivatives, which requires massive calcu-
lations and close-to-real-time operations under many trading and
arbitrage scenarios, were largely infeasible in the past. However,
with the advancement of modern computing, the efﬁciency has sub-
stantially improved. In this work, we propose and design a multi-
path option pricing approach via autoregression (AR) process and
Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). Our approach learns and incor-
porates the price characteristics into AR process, and re-generates
the price paths for options. We apply our approach to price weekly
options underlying Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted
Stock Index (TAIEX) and compare the results with prior practiced
models, e.g., Black-Scholes-Merton and Binomial Tree. The results
show that our approach is comparable with prior practiced models.1

1. INTRODUCTION

Derivative is a ﬁnancial product whose value is determined by an
underlying asset, such as stock, currency or commodity. As a pri-
mary type of derivative, option is widely traded in ﬁnancial market
for a number of purposes, including speculation, hedging, spreading
and creating synthetic positions. According to investors’ personal
perspective for future economy, two types of option are traded on
the market, i.e., Call Options and Put Options. A call option is an
agreement that gives an investor the right to buy the underlying asset
at a speciﬁed price within a speciﬁc time period. On the other hand,
a put option is the right to sell a speciﬁed amount of an underlying
asset at a speciﬁed price within a period of time. Furthermore, op-
tion investors can enter into either long position or short position on
both types of options under different trading strategies. However, the
major problem behind these trading purposes for option investors is
to ﬁnd option premium by using mathematical models.

The ﬁeld of option pricing was ﬁrst introduced during nineteenth
centuries. Related techniques used in this area can be classiﬁed into
two aspects, namely closed-form solutions and numerical solu-
tions.
In 1973, Black, Scholes [1] and Merton [2] provided the
state-of-art closed-form solution to European-style options pricing
problem in their seminal studies, known as the Black-Scholes-
Merton (BSM) model. Their contributions have subsequently led
to a thriving growth in options trading via a mathematical tractabil-
ity and legitimacy for the traders and institutional regulators. For
example, Johnson and Shanno [3], and Hull and White [4] applied

ogy, Taiwan under grant numbers 104-2221-E-001 -008 -MY3, 105-2221-E-
001 -009 -MY3, and 106-2218-E-002 -014 -MY4.

Stochastic Volatility model to do option pricing. This model as-
sumes that volatility has random processes and ﬂuctuations over
time. Consequently, similar studies include those proposed by E.
Stein and J. Stein [5], and Heston [6]. Moreover, Cox [7] derived
the well-known Constant Elasticity of Variance model which is
extended by Schroder [8]. However, closed-form solutions serve
as a suitable model if ﬁnancial instruments have simple structures
and assumptions. On the other hand, numerical methods such as
Lattice approach, Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) method, and
Finite Difference method were commonly used to price derivatives
with complex structure and products with path-dependent charac-
teristic, e.g., Boyle [9], Hull and White [10], and Brennan and
Schwartz [11]. Since Boyle demonstrated how to price European-
style options using MCS method [12], MCS method has become
one of the most important techniques in numerical solutions. For
instance, Boyle, Broadie and Glasserman [13] proved the ability to
apply MCS method to evaluate American-style options. Further-
more, Longstaff and Schwartz provided Least Squares Monte Carlo
method to deal with option pricing when underlying asset follows
a jump-diffusion process [14].
In the past, the major problem of
numerical solutions was that the pricing results were not exact due
to computational inefﬁciency; however, with the advancement of
modern computing and related researches, e.g., Kim and Byun [15],
and Wang and Kao [16], this problem has substantially improved.

Recently, the growing trend of High Frequency Trading has led
investors into seeking proﬁt within a shorter period. In consequence,
short-duration options have substantially draw great attention be-
cause of their high volatility that provides investors a better opportu-
nity to earn extra proﬁt. However, there is a paucity of literature on
the discussion of short-term options pricing, e.g., Andersen, Fusari
and Todorov [17]. Hence, we would like to investigate the prob-
lem of options pricing when option period is less than or equal to a
week. In order to analyze the problem, we choose weekly options
(TXOW) which issued by Taiwan Futures Exchange (TFE) and con-
nected with Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock
Index (TAIEX). Moreover, TXOW is an European-style option that
can only be exercised at the option’s expiration date.
In our ap-
proach, we utilize the correlation of day-by-day price change by de-
signing a multi-path simulation algorithm to extract the information
via autoregression (AR) process and MCS method [18]. Then, we
compare our results with two kinds of commonly used models: (1)
Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) and, (2) Binomial Tree (BT). In con-
clusion, the model we built (Multi-path Autoregression Monte Carlo
Approach, MAMC) shows comparable performance as well as other
commonly practiced models.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the datasets used in this paper; Section 3 provides an
overview of MAMC model; Section 4 contains description of both
BSM model and BT model, and the indicators for performance mea-

 
 
 
 
 
 
surement; Finally, the simulation results obtained in this work are
examined in Section 5 and the conclusions of this paper are written
in Section 6.

2. DATA STRUCTURE

In this paper, we use two sets of data that contain information of
options and underlying assets. First, we obtained a list of TXOW
that was issued between January 7, 2015 to December 21, 2016.
Furthermore, ten call options and ten put options with strike price
relatively close to prior trading day’s TAIEX closing price, were se-
lected on each issue date. These information provide issue date, due
date, strike price, and its market price on each trading day for each
option. Second, we collect a series of TAIEX’s daily closing price
from 2014 to 2016 through Google Finance API. Details of chosen
options are described in Panel A (2015) and Panel B (2016) of TA-
BLE 1.

method on a stochastic process. On top of that, we estimate both pa-
rameters by using underlying asset’s closing price based on N -day
rolling horizon statistics. After describing the concept in our model,
we apply this model to price the premium of TXOW which issues at
time t.

3.2. Expected Return

Before pricing the option, we set a training dataset of price return
N days before time t for regression process. Then, we calculate
logarithmic price changes with (1) and deﬁne price return series YN,t
as:

YN,t =

yt
{

i

−

|

i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N

.
}

(3)

After that, we compute ﬁrst-order autocorrelation parameter α
for entire YN,t series under Least Square Method (LSM). By using
the computation results, we can write the expected return yt as:

where yt represents expected return on time t.

yt = α

3. MULTI-PATH AUTOREGRESSION ALGORITHM

3.1. Model Overview

In this section, we give the details of the construction and processing
steps in our model. First, we consider TAIEX as a discrete-time
asset with closing price St at time t, and St
1. In order
to estimate the regularities and patterns, we have to generate serial
price return data with the rate of price changes. Therefore, we deﬁne
the change rate yt as the logarithm of the ratio of closing price:

1 at time t

−

−

Next, we would like to compute unexpected return which caused by
unpredicted factors, such as temporary market shocks and investor
irrationality. In previous equations, we deﬁned price return consists
of expected and unexpected return. That is:

yt = yt + θt,

t = 1, 2, 3, ....

(5)

in which yt is the real return for TAIEX at time t. θt is the un-
expected return, which is the difference between real return yt and
expected return yt. Meanwhile, we consider the series of unexpected
return over the past N days ΘN,t as:

ΘN,t =

θt
{

i

|

−

i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N

.
}

(6)

By using historical volatility of unexpected return, we can estimate
future price change at time t + 1 as follows:

where ε is a white noise

yt+1 = α

yt + ε,

∗
N (0, σ2
ΘN,t).

∼

Then, we generate the expected price of underlying asset at the
expiration date of an option by performing (7) T times which equals
to the day remaining before options expiration. That is:

(7)

T

exp(yt),

(8)

ST = St

where ST is the closing price of underlying asset at the expiration
date of an option.

Hence, closing price at time t can be represented as St. That is:

St = St

∗

exp(yt),

t = 1, 2, 3, ....

(2)

Second, we assume that price return on each day consists of
two parts: an expected return as a dependent variable affected by
previous price change which generated through AR process and an
unexpected return whose value are computed by performing MCS

Finally, we perform previous processes through MCS for U times
and subtract option’s strike price from each outcome. Then, we dis-
count the value with risk-free rate r and calculate the expectation
of all traces with (9) and (10), which generate the premium of call
options and put options.

ment from this paper.

4. MODEL COMPARISON

In this section, we present the equations of two practiced models,
namely Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) and Binomial Tree (BT),
when models are used to price European-style options on a non-
dividend-paying index. Equations are given as follows:

5. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1. Training Period Determination

In ﬁnancial market, the ﬂuctuations of volatility can be categorized
into short-, mid-, and long-term periods. These ﬂuctuations were
caused by secular trend, irregular ﬂuctuation or periodical adjust-
ment, e.g., seasonal and cycling variation. Furthermore, previous
literature showed that these ﬂuctuations are the reasons that lead to
volatility clustering among various ﬁnancial time series [20]. In or-
der to adjust volatility clustering, investors usually use a speciﬁc pe-
riod of time, like a month (21 days), a quarter (63 days) or a year
(252 days) when calculating annualized volatility. This process pro-
vides investors a reasonable and proper assumption of generating
the volatility that reﬂects market conditions. Therefore, the annu-
alized volatility applied to BSM model and BT model is calculated
from daily historical closing prices based on 252-day rolling horizon
statistics and the value of N in MAMC model is set to 252 as well.

5.2. Simulation Results

where p represents the probability of the underlying stock to in-
crease following geometric Brownian motion with parameters r and
σ. CBT and PBT are the price for call options and put options gen-
erated from BT model. The other parameters have the same assump-
tion as BSM model.

After determining the training period, we use MAMC model to price
options which was issued in 2015 and 2016. These options were
also evaluated via practiced models. The results of option pricing in
2015 and 2016 were shown separately in TABLE 3 and TABLE 4.
Moreover, we classiﬁed options based on their (A) Type (Call/Put),

and (B) Moneyness to investigate further implications under differ-
ent scenarios.

First, the outcomes in 2015 are different from the results in 2016.
In 2015, MAMC model has the best performance; however, BSM
model is a better solution in 2016. Despite the fact that no model has
absolute advantage in short-term options pricing, this result shows
that MAMC model has the ability to price short-term options as well
as practiced models. In addition, BT model has the poorest outcomes
among three models.

Second, we investigate the results under different scenarios in
Panel A and Panel B. In Panel A, we report the pricing performance
for each model upon different option types (Call Options/Put Op-
tions). While determining the premium of put options, the outcomes
show that MAMC model outperforms other models in both 2015
and 2016. Despite the signiﬁcant outcomes on put options pricing,
MAMC model shows a modest ability to evaluate call options. In
2016, BSM model has better performance on call options pricing.
These results point out the advantage of our approach while pricing
put options.

Then, we separate options according to its moneyness, which
represents a situation whether an option is generating proﬁt. The
results show that MAMC model outperforms other models on most
parts (12 out of 15) in 2015. On the other hand, BSM model has
better performance on the mass of options (10 out of 15) in 2016.
After taking a deeper look into three segments in Panel B, we ﬁnd
out that the results of both STD and RMSE show a decreasing trend
from ITM options to OTM options; however, SMAPE and APE, in-
dicators of error measurement in percentage scale, have an increas-
ing movement. While these phenomenon occur in all models, we

believe that the outcomes are caused by different types of money-
ness. After investigating this matter, we observe the fact that market
prices of OTM options are usually lower than market prices of ITM
and NTM options. In some extreme cases, price of OTM options
were lower than one. These phenomenon will shrunk down the de-
nominator in the equations of SMAPE and APE and lead to poor
performance on evaluating OTM options. Hence, RMSE is a better
indicator for comparing the performance of OTM options pricing.

In order to evaluate overall performance of three models, we
decide to check which model has the advantage over other mod-
els when pricing each type of options (All, Panel A and Panel B).
To sum up, MAMC model performs better (8 out of 12) than BSM
model (4 out of 12) on pricing weekly options within 2015 and 2016.

6. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we provide a compound model for option pricing via
AR process and MCS method. With ﬁne results yielded by MAMC
model, we prove the feasibility of applying this methodology to price
short-term options. However, some disadvantages exist in MAMC
model when pricing call options. These results are the direction of
our future researches. First, we will probe into order selection on AR
process in order to improve MAMC model’s performance. Second,
MAMC model shows worse results when evaluating call options in
2016 than in 2015. The reasons of worse outcomes might need fur-
ther investigations. Finally, MCS method serves as the basis of ad-
vanced Machine Learning models (e.g., ANN and Deep Learning).
Using these models in the ﬁeld of option pricing could be another
interesting direction.
