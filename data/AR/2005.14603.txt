principles description of both the electronic- and the vibrational properties of TiSe2, M. Hellgren
et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 176401 (2017)]. The GW approximation provides a parameter-free
description of screened exchange but is usually employed perturbatively (G0W0) making results more
or less dependent on the starting point. In this work, we develop a quasi-self-consistent extension
of G0W0 based on the random phase approximation (RPA) and the optimized eﬀective potential
of hybrid density functional theory. This approach generates an optimal G0W0 starting-point and
a hybrid exchange parameter consistent with the RPA. While self-consistency plays a minor role
for systems such as Ar, BN and ScN, it is shown to be crucial for TiS2 and TiSe2. We ﬁnd the
high-temperature phase of TiSe2 to be a semi-metal with a band structure in good agreement with
experiment. Furthermore, the optimized hybrid functional agrees well with our previous estimate
and therefore accurately reproduces the low-temperature charge density wave phase.

I.

INTRODUCTION

TiSe2 is a layered quasi-two-dimensional material
that undergoes an unconventional charge density wave
(CDW) transition below 200 K. The apparent interplay
between the CDW and superconductivity at ﬁnite pres-
sure or doping1,2 has lead to numerous studies over the
past years aiming to understand the driving mechanism
behind the CDW. Nevertheless, the relative role played
by excitonic eﬀects and electron-phonon coupling is still
debated. Experimentally, strong signatures are observed
in both vibrational3–6 and angle-resolved photoemission
spectra (ARPES),7–13 and some studies point to soft elec-
tronic modes.14

First-principle calculations should be able to explain
the exact mechanism of the CDW transition. How-
ever, numerically tractable approaches such as the lo-
cal density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradi-
ent approximations (GGAs) within density functional
theory (DFT) fail to give a complete picture.5,15,16 A
dramatic improvement is found when including a frac-
tion of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange via the hybrid
functionals.17–19 With a result similar to the DFT+U
approach,16,20 the Ti-d levels are then well described.
In addition, the hybrid functionals contain the long-
range Coulomb interaction which was shown to be cru-
cial to induce the CDW phase.19 This fact suggests that
strong electron-hole coupling is at play and that an exci-
tonic transition could be of importance.21,22 On the other
hand, it was also found that the standard medium-range
hybrid functional already gives a quantitatively reason-
able agreement between theory and experiment. How-
ever, the results also showed to be strongly dependent on
the hybrid parameters, making it still uncertain whether

a parametrization optimized on a test-set of standard
semi-conductors is adequate.

The GW method is computationally more expensive
but provides a parameter-free and physical description
of screened exchange. The bare Coulomb interaction is
replaced by the screened Coulomb interaction, W , which
is determined by the linear density response function ap-
proximated at the Hartree level, i.e., the random phase
approximation (RPA).23,24 The GW approximation for
the self-energy is known to produce accurate band-gaps
on a wide range of systems.25–28 It is, however, almost al-
ways employed perturbatively (G0W0), on top of a DFT
Kohn-Sham (KS) band structure, assuming that the KS
electronic structure is close enough to the ﬁnal result.
Other variants that bring results closer to self-consistency
have also been developed.29–32 An alternative to the fully
self-consistent GW scheme is to look for the optimal KS
starting-point via the Sham-Schl¨uter equation.33–35 The
resulting KS potential produces a density similar to the
GW density and is known as the RPA potential.36,37 The
KS RPA band structure can be shown to provide a con-
sistent starting-point for G0W0.38,39

A high-level calculation of the electronic band struc-
ture of TiSe2 in the high-T phase would be valuable.
While transport experiments all predict a semi-metallic
behaviour some ARPES measurements have found a
gap.7,8 The latter scenario was supported by the ﬁrst
G0W0 calculation and interpreted as an excitonic gap.40
In this work, we will re-examine how G0W0 performs
on TiSe2 by ﬁrst showing that it is a case sensitive
to exchange in the starting-point. As a fully self-
consistent calculation is out of reach we develop a quasi-
self-consistent approach that exploits the local hybrid po-
tential as an approximation to the local RPA potential.

In this way, we produce a theoretically justiﬁed G0W0 so-
lution that approximates the RPA solution. At the same
time we generate an RPA-optimized hybrid functional
that is used to study the CDW phase.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we start
by reviewing the GW formalism and the RPA as a self-
consistent way to do perturbative G0W0. We then in-
troduce a hybrid functional approach based on the op-
timized eﬀective potential. Using this potential we then
develop a quasi-self-consistent G0W0 scheme and com-
pare it to variants introduced by others.
III
we present numerical results for Ar, BN, ScN, TiS2 and
TiSe2. We also use the RPA optimized hybrid functional
to study the CDW phase of TiSe2. Finally, in Sec. IV
we present our conclusions.

In Sec.

II. SCREENED EXCHANGE FROM GW

We will focus on studying the performance of the GW
approximation in describing the band structure of the
high-T phase of TiSe2. The results turn out to be
strongly dependent on which approximate GW scheme
is used.
In this section we, therefore, start by review-
ing the diﬀerent ways to solve the GW equations and
discuss the connections between GW , RPA, COHSEX
(COulomb Hole Screened EXchange) and hybrid func-
tionals. This will allow us to ﬁnally motivate a quasi-
self-consistent G0W0 approach based on the local hybrid
potential.

A. The GW approximation

We deﬁne the self-energy as the nonlocal frequency de-
pendent potential Σ that contains all the many-body ef-
fect beyond the Hartree (H) approximation. To ﬁrst or-
der, in an expansion in terms of the Green’s function, G,
and the Coulomb interaction, v, Σ is just the static but
nonlocal Fock term of the HF approximation,

2

we then have access to the many-body quasi-particle
spectrum contained in G.

It can further be shown that the GW approximation
is a Φ-derivable approximation41,42 that obeys physical
conservation laws and has an underlying action func-
tional. An example of such an action functional is the
Klein functional43

YK = −iΦ[G] − UH + iTr [GG−1

H − 1 + ln(−G−1)],(5)

where UH is the Hartree energy. With the choice

Φ[G] =

1
2

Tr{ln[1 + ivGG]}

(6)

it is easy to see that YK is stationary when G obeys
Dyson’s equation (Eq. (4)), and the self-energy is equal
to

Σ =

δΦ
δG

= iGW.

(7)

At the stationary point the Klein functional is equal
to the GW total energy as obtained from the standard
non-variational Galitskii-Migdal energy expression.44

Instead of using the Hartree approximation as the ze-
roth order approximation for G one can start from the
DFT KS system. The Dyson’s equation can then be re-
written in terms of the single-particle KS Green’s func-
tion, Gs, and the exchange-correlation (xc) part of the
local KS potential

G = Gs + Gs[Σ[G] − vxc]G.

(8)

The diagonal of G, i.e. the density, is already exactly
In this way, Gs can be assumed to

be ’close’ to G, justifying a perturbative treatment of
Eq. (8), and thus circumventing the full solution to the
numerically challenging Dyson’s equation. By writing
Eq. (8) in the basis of KS orbitals and keeping only the
diagonal terms we can write the quasi-particle equation
as26,45

ΣHF = iGv.

(1)

Ek = εk + (cid:104)k|Σs(Ek) − vxc|k(cid:105)

(9)

By replacing the bare Coulomb interaction in the Fock
term with the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction,
W , we obtain the self-energy within the GW approxima-
tion

Σ = iGW.

(2)

The screened interaction within the GW approxima-
tion is approximated at the time-dependent Hartree level
for which the irreducible polarizability, P , is approxi-
mated with P0, i.e., to zeroth order in the explicit de-
pendence on the Coulomb interaction. We thus have

W = v + vP0W, P0 = −iGG.

From Dyson’s equation,

G = GH + GHΣ[G]G,

(3)

(4)

where k refers to the Bloch orbital index. The subscript
s on the self-energy signiﬁes that it is evaluated with Gs.
The energy dependence of Σs can either be treated to
zeroth order, i.e. Ek = εk, where εk is the KS eigenvalue,
or to ﬁrst order in a Taylor expansion around εk. The
latter implies that a renormalization factor

(10)

should be multiplied in the following way

Ek = εk + Zk(cid:104)k|Σs(εk) − vxc|k(cid:105).

(11)

This G0W0 correction, starting from PBE or LDA, is
the most common GW approach to determine the band

structure. The justiﬁcation of this approach relies, how-
ever, on the assumption that PBE or LDA orbitals are
similar to the true quasi-particle orbitals. The renor-
malization factors are usually incorporated but it can be
argued that these should be omitted.38 The arguments
are based on the connection between GW and the RPA
for the total energy,36,46,47 as we will now discuss.

Let us go back to the Klein energy functional (Eq. (5))
and keep the Φ-functional in the GW approximation.
From now on we will add superscripts (ΦGW , ΣGW ) as
we focus only on this approximation. If we replace the
interacting G, in every term, with a non-interacting Gs
we can, after a few manipulations, write Eq. (5) as

K [Gs] = −iΦGW [Gs] + Ts[n] + UH + Uext
Y GW

(12)

where Ts is the kinetic energy of non-interacting KS elec-
trons and Uext is the external potential energy. It is easy
to see that ΦGW [Gs] is exactly the same functional as
the xc energy of the RPA energy functional

ERPA

xc ≡ −iΦGW [Gs] = −

i

Tr{ln[1 + ivGsGs]}.

(13)

Eq. (12) is thus nothing but the RPA total energy, i.e.,
K [Gs] = ERPA.36,47,48
Y GW
The RPA energy functional can be shown to have a
minimum when varied with respect to the total KS po-
tential Vs = vext + vH + vxc. Such a variation can be
carried out via the functional Gs[Vs]. At the minimum
vxc = vRPA
obeys the so-called linearized Sham-Schl¨uter

(14)
where Λs(3, 2; 1) = −iGs(3, 1)Gs(1, 2) and χs(2, 1) =
−iGs(2, 1)Gs(1, 2).49 The LSS equation can also be de-
rived from the condition that the GW density and the
KS RPA density, i.e.
the diagonals of G and Gs, are
the same to ﬁrst order when expanding Dyson’s equation
(Eq. (8)).

As the RPA potential is a local KS potential it does
not reproduce the fundamental gap.33–35 One can, how-
ever, still calculate the gap, Eg, corresponding to the
RPA functional by taking the derivative of the energy
functional with respect to particle number N . One ﬁnds

To derive these expressions Eq. (14) has to be used. The
quantity ∆xc equals what is called the derivative discon-
tinuity within DFT.50–53

It is now clear that the gap obtained from the RPA
functional is nothing but the G0W0 correction of Eq. (11),
without the Zk factor, evaluated with the RPA poten-
tial. The RPA potential can thus be seen as an optimal
KS starting point for G0W0, which produces a gap equal
to the gap extracted from the RPA functional.38 It has
been shown on a number of semiconductors39 that using
the RPA potential for a G0W0 calculation brings gaps in
closer agreement with self-consistent GW approaches.31
By expanding the GW quasiparticle energy around the
zeroth order RPA KS energy and using Eq. (14) the ex-
pressions in Eqs. (16)-(17) are easily extended to the
whole band structure,38

To conclude we have reviewed how it is possible to
calculate gaps and even the full band structure from the
RPA and that this corresponds to the perturbative G0W0
result evaluated with the local RPA potential. These
are well-known results that we will base the following
discussions on.

B. Hybrid functionals and the COHSEX
approximation

We will now turn to the simpler COHSEX and hy-
brid functionals which are often used as cheaper but self-
consistent alternatives to the GW approach.

The frequency dependence of the GW self-energy al-
lows for the description of many-body eﬀects such as
quasi-particle lifetimes and satellite spectra but severely
complicates a fully self-consistent solution. Often one is,
however, only interested in the quasiparticle excitation
energy for which the nonlocality of the self-energy plays
the most important role. It is then motivated to approxi-
mate Σ by ignoring dynamical eﬀects in W . This implies
setting

Wstatic = v + vP0(ω = 0)Wstatic,

(21)

and results in the so-called COHSEX approximation

ΣCOHSEX = iGWstatic +

(22)

where W d
p = Diag [vP0(ω = 0)Wstatic] is a local Coulomb-
hole potential and the ﬁrst term is a nonlocal statically

4

screened exchange operator. The COHSEX approxima-
tion can easily be solved self-consistently but can still
be numerically demanding since it requires the genera-
tion and summation over all conduction bands. A more
drastic approach that avoids the inclusion of unoccupied
bands is to keep the bare Coulomb interaction as in the
HF approximation but scale it down with a constant α.
If we then add a compensating fraction of the local PBE
exchange and a local PBE correlation term we get the
so-called hybrid functionals

C. Optimal G0W0 starting point based on a local
hybrid potential

The common crucial ingredient in GW , COHSEX and
hybrid functionals is the nonlocal exchange term. Due
to this similarity the hybrids can be used as a way to do
approximate self-consistent GW . Such an approach was
developed in Refs. 32 and 60. By using a hybrid as a
starting-point for G0W0 the α parameter is varied until
the GW correction vanishes. At this value, the GW and
hybrid eigenvalues agree

(27)

These functionals are structurally similar to COHSEX
but not more demanding than a HF calculation. One
of the drawbacks is that a free parameter is introduced.
A fraction 25% (PBE0) has shown to be reasonable in
many molecular systems. In the HSE06 functional a sec-
−1
ond parameter, µ = 0.2 ˚A
, that controls the range of
the Coulomb interaction is introduced.54 In this way, it
is possible to get a good description of many semicon-
ductors as well.

Although often used in a DFT context the hybrid func-
tionals are almost always treated like the HF approxima-
tion, that is, by minimizing the energy with respect to or-
bitals that are generated by the nonlocal Fock potential.
In this work we will instead use the optimized eﬀective
potential method55 and minimize the hybrid energy with
respect to a local KS potential. The local KS potential
corresponding to HF has been evaluated for solids before
and is know as the exact-exchange (EXX) potential.56,57
The local hybrid potential is given by the sum of the lo-
cal potentials derived from the PBE terms and a local
exchange potential obtained from an equation similar to
the LSS equation (Eq. (14)) but with ΣGW
replaced by
the scaled HF self-energy. We have

Here the matrix elements are evaluated with orbitals
generated by the nonlocal ΣHYB,α
, emphasized by the
sub(super)-script nl. This method has been shown to
perform well for molecules, improving the ionization en-
ergies as compared to standard hybrid functionals and
G0W0 based on the PBE starting-point.32 We note, how-
ever, that it is not possible to derive an equation similar
to Eq. (18) combining the Klein GW energy functional
with a nonlocal potential. In fact, it has been shown to
lack an extremum when varied in a restricted space of
nonlocal but static potentials.61

We will now present a variant that utilizes the RPA
energy and, hence, the optimization with respect to a lo-
cal potential. As seen in the previous subsection a G0W0
correction based on the local RPA potential is justiﬁed
via the GW LSS equation (Eqs. (14) and (20)). Anal-
ogously, a hybrid correction based on the local hybrid
potential is justiﬁed via the hybrid LSS equation. We
have

in Eq. (27) above). In this way, we optimize α such that
the DFT hybrid functional behaves like the RPA func-
tional when varying the particle number. The diﬀerence
between this approach and the one in Ref. 32 lies in which
type of reference system is used to evaluate the GW en-
ergy. Allowing for nonlocal potentials can have a large
impact on the energy due to the opening of a large gap.
Due to lack of frequency dependence in ΣHYB,α

potential, is the ”quasi-particle self-consistent GW ” of
Ref. 30. This approach requires, however, the generation
of the full self-energy matrix and not just the diagonal
terms, making it more expensive than the approach sug-
gested here. Results from this approach have shown that,
indeed, self-consistency in the orbitals is important.67

In the next section we will show that self-consistency
has a very small eﬀect on systems where PBE already
gives a good description of the orbitals. In contrast, for
systems where exact-exchange plays an important role,
self-consistency is necessary and we will show that, via
Eq. (31), it is possible to obtain meaningful results. The
validity of the G0W0-approach is determined by the va-
lidity of the RPA for the given system. Furthermore, by
approximating the RPA potential with the local hybrid
potential we generate, as a bi-product, a hybrid func-
tional that can be used to study other properties such as
phonons and lattice instabilities.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we start by introducing TiSe2 and the
technical aspects of our calculations. We then present
the G0W0 results for TiSe2, TiS2 and a set of well-known
systems (Ar, c-BN and ScN) for which there already exist
both EXX and G0W0 results in the literature. Finally, we
investigate the performance of the RPA optimized hybrid
functional in capturing the CDW phase of TiSe2.

A. System and computational details

The high-T phase of TiSe2 crystallizes in the space
group P ¯3m1. It belongs to the 1T family of the layered
transition metal dichalcogenids with the Ti-atom octa-
hedrally coordinated by six neighbouring Se-atoms. A
semi-metallic behaviour is found in most experiments.
Below 200 K a CDW transition occurs, characterised by
a 2 × 2 × 2 superstructure (space group P 3¯c1) and the
opening of a small gap. The distortion pattern can be
uniquely deﬁned by the displacement δTi and the ra-
tio δTi/δSe ≈ 3. Standard DFT functionals predict a
phonon instability at the three equivalent L points. A
symmetric combination of these gives the correct CDW
pattern, but with a severely underestimated distortion
amplitude.16 Hybrid functionals give a better description
and have revealed the important role of HF exchange
for the instability. This possibly hints to the presence
of an excitonic instability. Although a weakly screened
electron-hole interaction is clearly important, no sponta-
neous electronic CDW has so far been generated in bulk
TiSe2. Hybrid functionals induce the CDW via a strong
electron-phonon coupling combined with the enhanced
electronic susceptibility at the L points. This mecha-
nism is given support by the combined accuracy of the
electronic bands, phonons and distortion amplitude.19

Let us now compare this approach to other GW -
schemes. The most common way to include some form of
self-consistency within GW is to iterate the eigenvalues,
i.e., solving Eq. (9), while keeping the KS orbitals ﬁxed
at the PBE level. This works well under the assump-
tion that xc eﬀects beyond PBE are unimportant for the
orbitals. An advantage of our approach is that it does
not rely on this assumption as it takes into account both
eigenvalues and orbitals at the same level of approxima-
tion. Another, more advanced approach, that takes into
account changes in the orbitals via a static but nonlocal

functional having an equal gap. The EXX results for Ar, BN and ScN are compared to EXX results found in the literature.

In this work we aim for the more sophisticated GW
method that allows for a physical description of the
screened interaction. Due to the increase in computa-
tional cost we have been limited to the high-T phase. The
low-T CDW phase will be studied with the RPA-based
hybrid functional, optimized according to the procedure
described in the previous section.

In addition, we have determined the gap of TiS2 which
is structurally identical to TiSe2 but lacks a CDW tran-
sition, at least in the bulk. We have only found one
GW study of TiS2 where the gap was determined to 0.75
eV,68 which can be compared to the experimental result
of around 0.5 eV.66 We have also looked at solid Ar (a
van der Waals bonded large-gap insulator), c-BN (a sp
bonded insulator) and ScN (a pd bonded semiconductor)
in order to illustrate the workings and validity of the
equations derived in Sec. II.

The hybrid calculations have been performed with
VASP,69–71 Quantum Espresso72 (QE) and the CRYS-
TAL program.73 Whenever comparisons could be made
these codes, despite using diﬀerent pseudopotentials, or
in the latter case, a Gaussian basis-set, agree rather well.
For example, pd gaps agree within 0.05 eV. For TiS2
and TiSe2 we have used a range-separation parameter
of µ = 0.1 ˚A
in all hybrid calculations. We chose
a range twice as large as in HSE06 since our previous
work on TiSe2 indicated that HSE06 was somewhat too
short ranged.19 The local hybrid potential was calcu-
lated with QE using an iterative algorithm for solving
(25)) (see Ref. 74 for
the LSS integral equation (Eq.
further details). The GW self-energy was subsequently
evaluated using the YAMBO code with full frequency
integration.75,76 For testing the optimization scheme in
Eq. (27) we switched to the VASP code which allows
the self-energy to be evaluated with a hybrid G0. Agree-
ment between diﬀerent codes that use diﬀerent numerical
techniques and pseudopotentials is still hard to achieve
within GW .77,78 Nevertheless, for Ar and c-BN, results

on the PBE-G0W0 level agree within 0.05 eV. For the pd
gapped systems we found variations up to 0.1 eV (TiS2
and TiSe2) and 0.2 eV (ScN), which should be taken into
account when comparing the diﬀerent schemes. We used
a 12 × 12 × 6 and 10 × 10 × 4 k-point grid for TiSe2 and
TiS2 respectively. Up to 500 unoccupied bands where
included in the self-energy.

B. G0W0 results

In Table I we present the band gaps of Ar, c-BN, ScN,
TiS2 and TiSe2. The PBE results are presented in the
ﬁrst column and the G0W0 results, obtained on top of
PBE orbitals, are presented in the second column. The
renormalization factor is omitted in all G0W0 calcula-
tions. To demonstrate the accuracy of our implementa-
tion of the LSS equation, the gaps obtained within the
EXX approximation (third column) are ﬁrst compared
to values found in the literature. We ﬁnd a very good
agreement in all cases where results are available. The
EXXc results are obtained by adding the PBE correla-
tion potential to the EXX potential. This EXXc poten-
tial is then used for obtaining the G0W0 results in the
next column. In this way, we provide both extremes of
the α-range: PBE (α = 0) and EXXc (α = 1.0). The α
parameter is then optimized according to Eq. (31). The
optimized value of α, the KS gap of the corresponding lo-
cal hybrid potential (lhyb), and the ﬁnal G0W0 gap are
presented in the following three columns. As a result of
Eq. (31), the G0W0 gap has to be the same as the pertur-
bative gap of the nonlocal hybrid functional (Eq. (28))
with parameter α. Finally, we present the H-G0W0 re-
sults which are obtained using the optimization scheme
of Eqs. (27), the HSE06 results and experimental values.
Looking at the results for Ar and c-BN we immediately
see that the G0W0 results are not so sensitive to which KS
potential is used. The EXX potential increases the KS

gap by around 1 eV but this leads only to a small increase
of 0.2-0.3 eV in the G0W0 gap. By optimizing α we ﬁnd
a gap in between (α = 0.57 for Ar and α = 0.25 for
c-BN). These values are consistent with RPA in a sense
that both RPA and the hybrid functional give the same
gap when evaluated with the orbitals of the optimized
local hybrid potential. We note that the H-G0W0 results
generally leads to larger values of α.

In ScN, a pd semiconductor, we see a partially diﬀerent
behaviour. First, PBE predicts a semi-metallic ground
state with a pd band overlap. Including exact-exchange
a KS gap of 1.57 eV opens. This rather large variation
produces again only a small variation at the G0W0 level.
However, the behaviour of the correction is opposite as
compared to the correction in Ar and c-BN by giving
a smaller G0W0 gap with EXXc than with PBE. This
somewhat counterintuitive behaviour was noted already

lines to the Γ − L path.

in Ref. 80. We now look at TiS2 which also has a pd
gap. We see a similar trend but now the GW variation is
larger, ranging from 0.3 eV with EXXc to 1.18 eV with
PBE. In this case, the optimization plays a crucial role.
With 25% of exchange the gap optimize to 0.82 eV. After
this study we are now ready to turn to TiSe2.

The high-T phase PBE band structure has been pub-
lished in several previous works, but is repeated here in
Fig. 1. The PBE (and LDA) result diﬀer strongly from
ARPES experiments as analysed in detail in Ref. 16.
Similar to ScN and TiS2 the Se-p -Ti-d band overlap is
severely overestimated and, in this case, even inverted at
Γ, leading to strong pd hybridization.16 Furthermore, the
pz orbitals corresponding to the ﬂattened p-band around
Γ is pushed above the Fermi level leading to excess d-
electron occupation. These large errors invalidate the
use of a standard PBE starting-point for G0W0. If we
use PBE as a starting-point for G0W0, we open a gap of
0.37 eV between Γ and L (see Table I). The band gap
is actually a bit smaller since we also found ’mexican
hat’ features around Γ similar to those reported in Ref.
40. These features are found already in the HF term but
disappears as soon as the orbitals are updated.19

In Fig.

1 we also compare the KS band structure
of the EXXc approximation to PBE. The correspond-
ing projected density of states (PDOS) is shown in the
side panel. The inclusion of exchange, even with a KS
local potential, corrects the occupations and opens a gap
between Γ and L. Including the discontinuity (Eq. (26))
the gap becomes as large as 3.75 eV, in agreement with
a HFc calculation.

In Fig. 2 we have plotted the exchange part of the
corresponding KS potentials (PBE and EXXc). The ac-
curacy of our LSS implementation can be seen from the

not only the density but also orbitals are well-mimicked
by the local KS potential. The eﬀect of exchange on the
d-orbitals might be one explanation for the sensitivity of
G0W0 to the fraction of exchange in the starting-point.
The larger is α the more charge is localized between the
Ti-atoms. The charge on the Se atoms,
i.e., the hy-
bridization with Se-p-orbitals, is instead seen to reduce
with α. The H-G0W0 yields a gap of 0.4 eV at 32% of
exchange, which is much larger than any experimental
value. We also performed a self-consistent COHSEX cal-
culation which gives a more reasonable result of 0.12 eV.
We stress that these gaps are not related to the CDW
since the symmetry is preserved in our calculations.

C. RPA optimized hybrid functional

The approach applied above shows that G0W0 predicts
a value for the pd band-overlap which is in good agree-
ment with many experiment. It also gives us a prediction
for α based on the derivative of the RPA functional. This
hybrid functional can now be used to study the CDW in-
stability, too expensive for an approach like GW or RPA.
For an in-depth analysis of the CDW instability with hy-
brid functionals we refer the reader to Ref. 19. Here we
will restrict ourselves to a comparison between the hy-
brid functionals obtained via the diﬀerent optimization
procedures described in Sec. II.

−1

To the right in Fig. (3) we have used the RPA opti-
mized α to calculate the energy gain in the supercell after
distorting the atoms according to the CDW pattern. We
have included both HSE06 and the ’best’ hybrid func-
tional (α = 0.17, µ = 0.0 ˚A
) from Ref. 19 for com-
−1
parisons. The set of parameters α = 0.2, µ = 0.1 ˚A
lies very close to the (α, µ) path used in Ref. 19 and
is not so diﬀerent from the set that agreed best with
experiment. Note, however, that in contrast to Ref. 19,
where the α-parameter was ﬁtted to the band gap and the
phonon-frequencies, here it results from a self-consistent
calculation.

If we look at the results for the H-G0W0 optimized
hybrid functional with 32% of exchange and a gap of
0.4 eV, we see that the energy gain strongly reduces.
Both the energy gain and the δTi distortion worsen as
compared to PBE. Given that the PBE underestimates
the phonon mode associated with the CDW amplitude
we do not expect this hybrid functional to accurately
capture the CDW phase.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have applied a self-consistent GW
method to TiSe2 in order to determine the much debated
band-gap/band-overlap without adjustable parameters.
We have also provided a theoretical justiﬁcation for the
choice of hybrid functional, i.e., the amount of admixture
of exact exchange.

smoothness of our EXXc potential. In EXXc we see ad-
ditional structures around the Ti-atom that are missing
in PBE. These barrier-like features typically act to lo-
calize charges. Looking at the density diﬀerence, EXXc
contracts the density around the Ti-atom. According to
Eq. (25) we expect a similar behaviour in the HFc ap-
proximation.

If we evaluate G0W0 on top of the EXXc band struc-
ture the gap closes and we ﬁnd a large band overlap (-
0.85 eV). The magnitude of the variation is very close
to the one in TiS2 and it is clear that a self-consistent
scheme is necessary. At optimal α = 0.2, we ﬁnd a small
band overlap of around 0.1 eV. ARPES has predicted re-
sults between -0.1 and 0.1 eV in the high-T phase.7–13
Our value is thus a reasonable prediction and shows that
even a metallic solution can be found within GW . The
electron-phonon mechanism found in Ref. 19 did not
crucially depend on the existence of a Fermi surface, but
a semi-metallic solution increases the probability for the
existence of a purely electronic CDW.

The band structure along Γ − M and A − L is shown
in Fig. (3) superimposed on the full band structure of a
hybrid functional with 20% of exchange (HYBα=0.2). We
see that not only the band overlap around the Fermi-level
agrees but also the band dispersions. Dynamical eﬀects
in the self-energy seem important around -3 eV where
the pd mixed ﬂat band is shifted downwards in the hy-
brid functional with respect to G0W0. Experiments place
this band somewhere in between.81 In Fig. (4) we have
superimposed the same results on an ARPES experiment
by Rohwer et al.79 Since spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not
included care should be taken when comparing with ex-
periment. Previous studies have shown that SOC splits
the degenerate p-bands at Γ which could have a small
eﬀect on the comparisons. Overall we see a very good
agreement between theory and experiment noting that
some of the deviations can be explained by looking at
diﬀerent values for kz (see discussion in Ref. 19).

To the right in Fig. 5 we have compared an unoccu-
pied d-orbital of the local hybrid with the same orbital
of the nonlocal hybrid. The orbitals are very similar de-
spite very diﬀerent underlying gaps. The same is true
for EXXc/HFc to the left in the ﬁgure, suggesting that

HFc Δpd = 3.70 eV EXXc Δpd = 0.80 eV lhybα=0.2 Δpd = -0.45 eV TiSeHYBα=0.2 Δpd = -0.14 eV 0.38 eV-0.45 eV-0.14 eV3.70 eVFirst of all, it was found that the standard G0W0 pre-
scription based on a PBE/LDA starting-point is unre-
liable due to qualitative errors in describing the band
structure within PBE/LDA. To overcome this prob-
lem we have developed a simple quasi-self-consistent ap-
proach based on the local hybrid potential and the RPA
functional. This approach allows for a systematic inclu-
sion of exact-exchange in the starting-point, which, in
the case of TiSe2 has a large impact on, e.g., the descrip-
tion of the Ti-d-orbitals, and the resulting pd gap. It is
shown that G0W0 converges to a semi-metallic ground-
state with a band-overlap of 0.1 eV. This is in line with
transport experiments and many ARPES results, but
contradicts ﬁrst G0W0 results based on the LDA starting-
point.

The G0W0 approach generates a hybrid α-parameter
consistent with RPA. With a motivated choice for µ this
hybrid functional produces an electron-phonon coupling
strong enough to induce the CDW transition. Further-
more, the potential energy surface lies very close to our

earlier published hybrid results which gave very accurate
phonons. While in our previous work, the α-parameter
was chosen as a best ﬁt to both the band gap and the
phonon frequencies, here it has been calculated via a self-
consistent procedure involving the G0W0 method. The
results are very similar, providing further support to the
proposed mechanism of the CDW distortion in TiSe2.
