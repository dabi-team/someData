Andreev tunneling and Josephson current in light irradiated graphene

Debabrata Sinha and Satyaki Kar∗

(Dated: June 21, 2018)

We investigate the Andreev tunneling and Josephson current in graphene irradiated with high-frequency lin-
early polarized light. The corresponding stroboscopic dynamics can be solved using Floquet mechanism which
results in an effective stationary theory to the problem exhibiting an anisotropic Dirac spectrum and modiﬁed
pseudospin-momentum locking. When applied to an irradiated normal graphene - superconductor (NS) inter-
face, such analysis reveal Andreev reﬂection (AR) to become an oscillatory function of the optical strength.
Speciﬁcally we ﬁnd that, by varying the polarization direction we can both suppress AR considerably or cause
the Andreev transport to remain maximum at sub-gap excitation energies even in the presence of Fermi level
mismatch. Furthermore, we study the optical effect on the Andreev bound states (ABS) within a short normal-
graphene sheet, sandwiched between two s-wave superconductors. It shows redistribution of the low energy
regime in the ABS spectrum, which in turn, has major effect in shaping the Josephson super-current. Subjected
to efﬁcient tuning, such current can be sufﬁciently altered even at the charge neutrality point. Our observa-
tions provide useful feedback in regulating the quantum transport in Dirac-like systems, achieved via controlled
off-resonant optical irradiation on them.

INTRODUCTION

The quantum transport in graphene1,2, with its low energy
Dirac spectrum1–4 at the edges of the brillouin zone, has re-
mained an engaging ﬁeld of study ever since its inception in
20045. Though experimental difﬁculties still remain in de-
tecting its transport characteristics at the edges6, its bulk be-
havior, described by the massless, chiral fermions4 has been
quite well probed by now. Tuning such system with strain-
ing or introducing gap in the Dirac spectrum witness notice-
able variations in the charge transport. Particularly, graphene
based superconductor—normal—superconductor (SNS) junc-
tion can be tuned to enhance supercurrent at the charge neu-
trality point upon straining7 or an energy gap can enhance
the pseudospin inverted Andreev conductance in a graphene-
based superconductor/pseudoferromagnet junction8. As it
turns out, such modiﬁcations can be easily implemented via
optical irradiation. The transport properties of the Dirac-like
systems are very much susceptible to light irradiation and
produce interesting outcomes such as exciting surface plas-
mon polaritons9–11 in graphene sheet, enhancing controllabil-
ity of electrodynamics in graphene-based metamaterials12,13
or allowing photo-reduction of graphene-oxide ﬁlms to tune
wettabiity14 and so on.

The energetics of the charge carriers of a graphene mono-
layer, periodically driven via high frequency electromagnetic
light waves with electrons strongly coupled to the photons, has
been analyzed recently15–21 using Floquet theory. There, the
electrons get dressed by the ﬁeld exhibiting drastic changes
in the dispersion. For example, it is observed that the circu-
larly polarized light create a ﬁeld induced gap at the charge
neutrality or Dirac point22–24. In contrast the energy spectrum
of electrons dressed by linearly polarized light is modiﬁed by

Bessel function and it remains gapless. The physical prop-
erties of dressed electrons have been studied in various con-
densed matter systems including quantum well25–27, quantum
rings28 and in recently in Dirac materials like graphene16,24,31,
Weyl semimetals29 and topological insulators30. In graphene
related systems, particularly attentions paid to the transport
n junctions31, magneto-
properties of dressed electrons in p
transport15 and spin transport of dressed electrons17, optical
response of dressed electrons19 and ﬁeld induced topological
phase transition31–33.

Though an effective stationary theory is constructed for
stroboscopic evolution of the fermionic wavefunction under
light irradiation,
to the best of our knowledge, no study
on transport behavior of the light irradiated superconducting
graphene junctions has been performed yet. We would like to
bridge this gap in the literature and study the tunneling con-
ductance of a normal metal-superconductor (NS) junction as
well as the Andreev bound state (ABS) and Josephson cur-
rent of a SNS junction in a strongly irradiated graphene sheet.
As a primary investigation, this paper deals with only irradia-
tion via linearly polarized light. A graphene is a semimetal
in which superconductivity can be induced via proximity
effect34. Transport through a NS junction experiences An-
dreev reﬂection (AR) for energy-bias smaller than the super-
conducting gap35. The resulting electron-hole conversion in
the Normal (N) sub-system and the cooper pair production in
the superconductor (S) counterpart develops a ﬁnite conduc-
tance across the NS junction. An irradiation via linearly polar-
ized light offers a tuning parameter α (which is a function of
both intensity and frequency of the light, to be elaborated later
on) to the problem. In the off-resonant conditions, the quasi-
particle velocities along a direction normal to the irradiated
ﬁeld get reduced, from its original graphene Fermi velocity
vF , by a factor of Bessel’s function J0(α). Thus the low en-
ergy spectrum of graphene becomes anisotropic, tunable by
the optical parameter α. This tunability allows for consider-
able variation in the Andreev current and subgap conductance

 
 
 
 
 
 
becomes an oscillatory function in α. With rotation of the
plane of polarization, this current can be enhanced to maxi-
mum or suppressed considerably, as can be found from our
calculation and results in section III.

In this work we also study the Andreev bound states (ABS)
and Josephson current on a light irradiated SNS junction in
graphene. The analysis of ABS and Josephson current in
graphene SNS junction is well studied in the literature36–38.
Our objective is to probe the effect of linearly polarized light
on such system/assembly. We ﬁnd that the low energy spec-
trum of the ABS get sufﬁciently affected by the optical ir-
radiation. As a result, the Josephson current get enhanced
or suppressed depending on the direction of polarization as
well as the value of the chemical potential. Signature of such
modiﬁcations are found at the charge neutrality point as well,
even though the density of state vanishes there. These interest-
ing observations, in fact, can provide possible route to control
quantum transport in graphene with relevance to the spintronic
based applications.

We reiterate here that the Hamiltonian of our light irradi-
ated system is time periodic due to the presence of a time
dependent ﬁeld of polarization and we resort to the Floquet
formalism to analyze the stroboscopic dynamics20,39 of this
time-periodic problem. Recently several authors have used
the Floquet theory in the context of Dirac materials15–17,30,33.
It generally presumes the frequency of the optical ﬁeld to
be off-resonant and thus does not cause any direct electronic
transition31. This can be achieved if the photon energy of the
polarized light meets the condition ωτ0 >> 1 where τ0 is
the relaxation time of the unirradiated graphene16. In the off-
resonant condition, energy conservation can thus be respected
within a ﬁrst order perturbation theory resulting in an effective
stationary Hamiltonian of the problem. Our construction, in
presence of a linearly polarize light, closely follows the work
presented in Ref.17.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II,
we describe the Floquet theory to derive the stationary Hamil-
tonian that we later work on. In section III we describe the
Andreev transport in irradiated graphene NS junction. In sec-
tion IV, we describe ABS and Josephson current through the
corresponding SNS junction and ﬁnally in section V, we sum-
marize our work and conclude.

Let us now bring in the Floquet picture for this periodically

can write ψk(t + T ) = e−iǫkT ψk(t), T = 2π/ω being the
time period of the ﬁeld. Here ǫk is the quasi-energy of the Flo-
quet mode which turns out to be the eigenvalue of the corre-
sponding Floquet Hamiltonian. We can absorb this exponen-
tial dependence in the coefﬁcients a±

As mentioned in the Introduction, what follows below for
the derivation of the stationary Hamiltonian of our irradiated
problem is an simple extension of the work performed in
Ref.15–18.

The low energy physics in graphene, around the Dirac
point, are described by the linear Hamiltonian Hk = ~vF σ.k
where σ & k denote the pseudo-spin (originating from the two
sublattice indices in the underlying honeycomb lattice) and
the wave-vectors of the Dirac particles respectively. In pres-
ence of a polarizing ﬁeld, the canonical momentum gets the

to keep our results more accountable, we consider only small

So, the Hamiltonian of a graphene get modiﬁed when irra-
diated with a linearly polarized light. Eq.(8) shows that, the
velocity vector is not parallel to the wave-vector (unless direc-
tion of propagation is along x or y) and thus quasiparticle tra-
jectory deviates from that it would be in absence of the light
irradiation. Note that, this Floquet theory formalism can be
extended to a circularly polarized light as well. It is well es-
tablished that, circularly polarized light introduces a gap at the
Dirac point of graphene by breaking the time reversal symme-
try. However, as mentioned earlier, this paper conﬁnes only in
studying the effects of a linearly polarized light. In the next
following section, we use the Hamiltonian Eq.(8) for our light
irradiated system and discuss what consequences it leads to in
the context of Andreev transport, ABS and Josephson current.
To be precise, all the results that are presented in this paper,
correspond to two values of θ0, namely θ0 = 0 and θ0 = π/2.

tive contributions of the sublattices A and B40. This sublattice

the graphene transport. The spin-singlet pair potential ∆(r) in
Eq.(9) is modeled as ∆(r) = ∆0eiφΘ(x) where ∆0 and φ are
the amplitude and phase of the induced superconducting order
parameter, respectively. In superconducting region there is a

larized light does not break the valley degeneracy of graphene
and for calculations, it sufﬁces to concentrate only on a single
valley.

Quantitative analysis of Andreev tunneling in a graphene
NS junction has been done extensively in Ref. 1,2,41. As
we ﬁnd that a high frequency irradiation modiﬁes only one
component of the quasiparticle velocity, we brieﬂy touch upon
those derivations for anisotropic carrier velocities, in the fol-
lowing.

quasiparticle transport occurs across the NS junction. How-

shows the same for θ0 = π/2. The plots are shown for α
upto 5 showing the variation of the Andreev reﬂectance, even
though we put our emphasis only on small values (shown by
solid lines) of α for which our approximation works the most.
In presence of light, the quasiparticles feel additional force
along (or opposite to) the electric ﬁeld direction and accord-
ingly for θ0 = 0, they bend towards x direction while for
θ0 = π/2, they bend towards the y direction. The reduction
in the vy, in the ﬁrst case, help keeping rA large due to Klein
tunneling while reduction in vx in the latter case cause r to
increase and rA to diminish (in fact, it causes rA = 0 when
vx vanishes, though this point lies outside the scope of the
present theory). In the sub-gap limit, the differential conduc-
tance also remains a functional of rA (or, r) alone. Addition-
ally for ǫ < (>)µ, retro (specular) type of Andreev reﬂection
develops at the junction2. The condition µ >> ∆0 implies
µ >> ǫ and retro-reﬂection is obtained. Note that, we indeed
µ in this paper as
consider this regime of ǫ < ∆0 and ∆0 ≪
that is what is achieved comfortably in experiments. However,
for the sake of continuity of discussion we also point out that
for µ << ∆0, ǫ > µ is obtained only within the restricted
range of ∆0 > ǫ > µ when specular Andreev reﬂection is
observed? . As ǫ becomes larger than ∆0, normal tunneling
begins and Andreev tunneling becomes smaller and smaller.

Let us ﬁrst discuss shortly the features of the transport phe-

5

nomena in normal graphene NS junction (i.e., in absence of
linearly polarized light or α = 0). Without a junction, we
will neither have electron reﬂection nor andreev reﬂection
henceforth yielding G = G0. Now putting a superconductor-
interface there witness andreev transport, for ǫ < ∆0, thereby
increasing the conductivity G. Without any potential barrier
(i.e., U0 = 0), G maximizes to 2G0 when no electron reﬂec-
tion takes place at the junction. For larger values of ǫ beyond
∆0, the electronic system becomes purely resistive and
rA|
gradually decreases down to zero (see Eq.18 for the expres-
sions for rA). As normal reﬂection probability increases with
barrier height, a larger U0 results in lesser amount of Andreev
reﬂection and reduced conductivity (see α = 0 point in Fig.2).
For ǫ >> ∆0, only a small fraction
∆0/ǫ of the incident
electrons get Andreev reﬂected42.

Now let us take a look at what a tuning via light irradia-
tion can cause to this transport phenomena. With moderate
U0, the andreev reﬂection or rA is generally large for ǫ < ∆0.
But with optical irradiation, andreev transport get reduced in
a periodic manner, as shown in Fig.1 (for rA) and Fig.2 (for
0 and for small α we see an
conductivity). However, for θ0 →

allowing mostly the reﬂection to happen (only for U0 6
whereas for U0 = 0, r takes a sharp jump from its minimum
to unity where J0(α) = 0). However, this discussion is redun-
dant as our theory breaks down in such limit as many n′

terms from the summation in Eq. 4 become signiﬁcant render-
ing our rotating wave approximation20 type formalism invalid.
As discussed for the α = 0 case, here also a ﬁnite U0 or Fermi
level mismatch results in a reduction in andreev reﬂection and
conductivity. In Fig.2, we have taken the frequency of inci-
dent light to be ~ω=1 meV and plotted G/G0 against the light
intensity I0 = 1

0.

In Fig.3, we show the ǫ dependence of the conductance.
With an increase in the excitations above the Fermi level, con-
ductivity increases due to enhanced andreev reﬂection which
becomes maximum at ǫ = ∆0. The α dependence that we
saw previously in Fig.2 for very small ǫ, survives for larger
ǫ (< ∆0) values as well. At ǫ = 0, conductivity starts from a
ﬁnite value that is a function of both α and U0. As excitation
= 0)
energy increases, so does the Andreev current (for U0 6
and G/G0 increases gradually until ǫ = ∆0 when the incident
quasiparticles no more face any gap at the boundary. Beyond
that point G/G0 show a resistive decay. The critical point
ǫ = ∆0 also witness a ﬁne reduction in conductance from
its maximum value 2 as α becomes nonzero (see the inset in
Fig.3). For θ0 = 0, subgap conductivity remains maximum
for one optimum value of α which varies with U0 (as seen in
Fig.2(a)). In fact, the corresponding upturn in conductivity as
α is turned on gradually, is responsible for the sudden jump in
G/G0 at/near ǫ = ∆0 as seen in Fig.3(a). Mean ﬁeld condi-
tion for superconductivity1, i.e. µ + U0 >> ∆0 is considered
throughout all calculations to ensure that phase coherence is
~vF
maintained within the S region over a distance of λS
µ+U0 .
In the next section, we will discuss about the ABS and

IV. ANDREEV BOUND STATES AND JOSEPHSON
CURRENT

Josephson supercurrent develops in a SNS junction due to
proximity effect34 and this is expressed in terms of the quan-
tized andreev bound states (ABS) developed within the inter-
mediate normal region. To calculate ABS and Josephson cur-
rent of optically dressed electrons, we consider a irradiated
graphene SNS junction where superconducting electrodes are
deposited in the left (region-I, with x < 0) and right regions
(region-II, with x > L), leaving a narrow middle region (II) to
be the normal graphene (see Fig.4). What we describe below
is a brief narrative of graphene SNS junction calculations of
Ref.1,41, worked out for our present case incorporating veloc-
ity anisotropy. Under exposure to linearly polarized light, the
energetics in the three different regions get modiﬁed and we
construct the wave functions as follows. For x < 0, we may

The procedure for calculating the Josephson current is to ﬁrst
obtain the energy spectrum for the Andreev bound states in
the intermediate normal region. This is done by matching the
wavefunctions at the two NS interfaces, and then solving for
the allowed energy states. Explicitly, the boundary conditions
dictate that,

Now we observe how ABS depends on the optical param-

eter α. Fig.5 shows the comparison between α = 0 and
α = 1.5. Without irradiation, electrons incident normally
(i.e., θe = 0) causes the bound-state energy to become zero

which contributes most to the superconduction, spread more
for θ0 = 0 or become an oscillating pattern for θ0 = π/2
(where further null values are obtained at discrete oblique in-
1). These can be seen in Fig.5
cident angles when γn →
bottom panels.

Experimentally, ABS features can also be perceived by
noticing the current phase relation which is shown in Fig.6.
The Josephson current is sensitive to the direction of light ir-
radiation on the graphene. This is due to fact that the trans-
mission probability γn is enhanced or suppressed when light
radiation is along x or y-direction respectively.

The behavior of critical current Ic of irradiated graphene-
based Josephson junction vs µL/~vF is shown in Fig.7.
Fig.7(a) shows the plot of Ic/I0 (I0 = e∆0/~) for the light
irradiation is along x-direction. As shown, the value of Ic of
irradiated graphene becomes larger with ﬁnite α as compared
to its normal value (for α = 0) at the charge neutrality point.
This is an interesting observation given the fact that graphene
transport is already special due to nonzero Josephson current
at µ = 0 notwithstanding its zero DOS, ﬁrst shown analyti-
cally by Titov and Beenakker (Ref.36). When light is irradi-

The value of Ic with µL/~vF is shown in Fig.7(b). It shows
that, Ic decreases with α at µ
0. For nonzero µ, how-
ever, the value of Ic and hence Josephson current of irradi-
ated graphene can be either enhanced or suppressed depend-
ing on the values of µ and α used. All these behavior can
be understood examining the expression for γn in Eq.(25) and
Eq.(27). For µ = 0, all the transport modes n become evanes-
cent and γn decays slower and faster as a function of qn in
Eq.(25) and Eq.(27) respectively. These results, to some ex-
tent, resemble that from a strained monolayer graphene, as
detailed in Ref.[7,44]. There, an applied mechanical strain on
a monolayer graphene breaks the isotropy in the velocity of a
quasiparticle by modifying the hopping parameter and thereby
makes the low energy spectrum anisotropic. This route, there-
fore, leads to similar outcome as ours. However, since a light-
controlled electronic device is typically much faster and easily
controllable than those mechanically or electrically controlled
devices, an optical tuning stands out as a more feasible means
to the experimentalists and we believe that our ﬁndings can
encourage a lot during building of future spintronic devices.
V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have studied extensively the Andreev trans-
port and Josephson effect in light irradiated, proximity in-

8

duced graphene NS and narrow SNS junctions.
In the off-
resonant condition that we study, the resulting Dirac spectrum
becomes anisotropic which unravels many unusual phenom-
ena such as reduction/enhancement of the subgap conductance
as well as the Josephson currents, depending on the direction
of polarization. In one extreme, we can tune in maximum an-
dreev conductivity in presence of Fermi level mismatch, for ir-
radiated ﬁeld along the junction direction. On the other hand,
noticeable reduction in AR is possible when the polarization
points parallel to the interface/junction. This latter feature can
be utilized in getting enhanced crossed Andreev reﬂection45
(CAR) in an irradiated graphene based NSN junction. Usually
in graphene NSN junctions, CAR is not perceived much due to
the local AR and elastic co-tunneling (EC) processes, unless
raising and lowering of the chemical potentials are performed
considering nSp or pSn type graphene bipolar transistors46.
However, in an irradiated graphene sheet, AR can be tuned to
get considerably suppressed. So it will be interesting to inves-
tigate the optical effect in strengthening the CAR signal even
without shifting the chemical potential of the normal leads and
thereby causing the non-local cooper pair splitting that spa-
tially separates the entangled electron pairs47. In fact, such
investigation will comprise our future plan of work. Lastly,
irradiation causes redistribution of the low energy regime in
the Andreev bound state. And as we have seen, it can be
tuned properly to produce enhanced supercurrent through a
graphene based SNS junction, even at the Dirac point in the
spectrum.

These interesting observations, in fact, can provide possible
route to control quantum transport in graphene with relevance
to the spintronic based applications. It will be equally inter-
esting to see the effect of light irradiation in transition metal
49 where spin or-
dichalcogenides such as silicene48 or M oS2
bit interaction plays an important role in transport.
