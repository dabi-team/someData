Abstract

The even-Z odd-N neutron-halo nuclei, which are the possible lightest neutron-halo nuclei heavier

than 37Mg, are explored by studying the shell-structure unique in weakly-bound neutrons for

spherical or deformed shape. It is pointed out that due to the narrowed N=50 spherical energy-

gap and a few resulting close-lying neutron one-particle levels, 1g9/2, 3s1/2, and 2d5/2, for spherical

shape, nuclei with some weakly-bound neutrons ﬁlling in those levels may be deformed and have a

good chance to show deformed s-wave halo. Promising candidates are 71

24Cr47, 73

24Cr49, 75

24Cr51 and

77
26Fe51 in the case that those nuclei lie inside the neutron drip-line. An interesting possibility of

the deformed p-wave or s-wave halo is suggested also for the nucleus 53

18Ar35.

INTRODUCTION

Halo phenomena, on which the experimental information started from Ref. [1], are so far

observed mostly in lighter nuclei close to neutron-drip-line and are one of the most interesting

phenomena in nuclei away from the stability line. In order to detect the occurrence of neutron

halo, either the measurement of the larger mean-square-radius of the matter distribution or

the detection of an appreciable amount of the probability of (one or several) weakly-bound

neutrons far away from well-bound core nuclei is most eﬃcient. The typical experiment done

so far to measure the former quantity is the measurement of reaction cross sections (σR)

[2], while the typical experiment to eﬃciently detect the latter one is to observe Coulomb

break-up reactions [3].

To my knowledge, the nucleus 37

12Mg25 is so far the heaviest nucleus which showed (de-
formed p-wave) halo properties [4]. One may wonder which nucleus heavier than 37Mg may

be expected to show (spherical or deformed) halo. In heavier nuclei it will be getting more

and more diﬃcult to clearly identify halo phenomena from the values of root-mean-square

radius, because the ratio of the number of halo particles to that of nucleons in well-bound

core nucleus gets smaller. Furthermore, some amount of increase of the matter radius may

occur also by the change from spherical to deformed shape. And, the rate of the increase

of the matter radius due to possible deformation may not generally decrease in heavier nu-

clei. On the other hand, the method such as Coulomb break-up reactions can be eﬃcient in

discovering possible halo also in heavier nuclei.

It is noted that the analysis of the data on Coulomb and nuclear break-up reactions of
37Mg so far seems to show that the experimental data can be well understood in terms of

particle picture without introducing the eﬀects of pair correlations [4, 5]. The question is
where we may ﬁnd any neutron-halo nuclei heavier than 37Mg. The Coulomb and nuclear
break-up data on the nucleus 37Mg were interpreted as the one-neutron deformed p-wave
halo [4] with the neutron separation energy (Sn) of 0.22+0.12

−0.09 MeV. In the case of neutron

p-wave halo the Sn-values should be much smaller than, say, 1 MeV in order to clearly detect

the characteristic feature of halo. In contrast, in the case of neutron s-wave halo the presence

of neutron halo can be detected for Sn-values appreciably larger than 1 MeV. Since Sn-values

of possible halo nuclei not yet found in the region of neutron drip-line cannot be guessed

so precisely and, thus, a successful prediction of neutron (spherical or deformed) p-wave

2

halo must have very good luck due to the narrow range of Sn-values for the realization of

halo phenomena, in the following I try mainly to look for possible spherical or deformed s-
wave halo nuclei heavier than 37Mg. In the present work only axially-symmetric quadrupole

deformation is considered as deformation.

If I limit myself to spherical nuclei, the ℓ = 0 halo can occur only around the nuclei with

very particular neutron numbers, of which the neutron Fermi level is placed around neutron

s1/2 orbits. One-particle s1/2 orbit appears only once in every Nho = even major shell, where

Nho expresses the principal quantum-number of the harmonic oscillator (ho) potential. The

appearance may occur in nuclei around the neutron number N=51 where the 3s1/2 orbit

should be ﬁlled (see Fig.3 of Ref.

[6]) by the 51st neutron in nuclei close to neutron-drip-

line. In contrast, if nuclei are deformed, expressing the angular-momentum component of
the particle along the symmetry axis by Ω all Ωπ = 1/2+ levels have, in principle, a chance
to become ℓ=0 halo [7]. This is because all Ωπ = 1/2+ orbits acquire ℓ=0 components

induced by the deformation and especially because the probability of the ℓ=0 component
in the bound one-particle wave-functions of neutron Ωπ = 1/2+ orbits increases strongly as

the one-particle energy εΩπ=1/2+ approaches zero [8, 9].

It is noted that the possibility of some isotopes in a certain region of the neutron number

to be deformed depends strongly on the proton number. For example, when the evolution of
+ energies in Ti, Cr and Fe isotopes for the neutron-number varying from 34 towards 50

21

is examined, it is seen that 24Cr or 26Fe isotopes are easy to be deformed while 22Ti isotopes

do not seem to be so. For example, see Fig. 9 of Ref. [10].

Since for a given proton number Z the neutron separation energy of odd-N nuclei ap-

proaches zero before even-N nuclei reach the neutron drip-line mainly due to the pairing-

blocking eﬀect in odd-N nuclei, it will be experimentally easier to ﬁnd neutron-halo nuclei
among odd-N isotopes. For example, while 37Mg25 is found to be a deformed p-wave halo
nucleus and 39Mg27 lies outside the neutron drip-line, both 38Mg26 and 40Mg28 lie inside

the neutron drip-line. Moreover, generally speaking, the scheme of low-lying levels in odd-N

nuclei would directly show the underlying neutron shell-structure. Thus, in the present work

I limit myself to the phenomena of one-neutron halo in nuclei with even-Z and odd-N in
the region heavier than 37Mg, keeping the nuclei as light as possible. Partly because no

quantitative information on the size of pair correlation in nuclei around the relevant neu-

tron drip-line is available, in the following I present the analysis of the wave function of the

3

last-odd neutron in odd-N nuclei which is obtained by neglecting the pair correlation. Even

in the presence of neutron pair-correlation in neighboring even-N nuclei the wave function

of the last-odd neutron in the ground state of odd-N nuclei can be studied in this way, at

least in the ﬁrst approximation.

In Sec. II the model used and the result of search for even-Z odd-N nuclei with possible

neutron halo are presented, while conclusions and discussions are given in Sec. III.

II. MODEL AND CANDIDATES FOR EVEN-Z ODD-N NUCLEI WITH POSSI-

BLE NEUTRON HALO

The basic points of the model are very similar to those used in Refs.

[6, 11].

I use

Woods-Saxon potentials with the standard parameters, which are described on p. 239 of

Ref.

[12], unless I mention speciﬁcally some parameters. While both weakly-bound and

resonant one-particle energies of neutrons in neutron-rich nuclei are examined in the present

work, the major part of the nuclear potentials for those neutrons is produced by protons,

which are deeply bound in the case of neutron-rich nuclei. Therefore, it may not be a surprise

that the parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential which were adjusted to various data on

stable nuclei in Ref. [12] could satisfactorily work in the analysis of the data on neutrons in

neutron-rich nuclei [2–4].

The way of calculating both bound and resonant one-particle energies in a spherical po-

tential is straightforward and can be found in various textbooks. In a deformed potential

the calculation of energies of bound neutrons is an eigenvalue problem by solving in coor-

dinate system the coupled diﬀerential equations obtained from the Schr¨odinger equation,

together with the asymptotic behavior of bound wave-functions in respective (ℓ, j) channels

for r → ∞. On the other hand, one-particle resonant energies are calculated by solving the

coupled diﬀerential equations in coordinate space using the asymptotic behavior of scatter-

ing states in respective (ℓ, j) channels and are deﬁned as the energies, at which one of the

eigenphases increases through π/2 as the one-particle energy increases [13]. One-particle

resonance is absent if none of the eigenphases increase through π/2 as the energy increases.

In the limit of β → 0 the one-particle resonances deﬁned for deformed potentials in terms of

eigenphase, of course, agree with the one-particle resonances in spherical potentials deﬁned

in terms of phase shift.

4

The mean deformation of relevant nuclei is not microscopically calculated in the present

article, because a reliable eﬀective interaction to be used in Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations

around neutron-drip-line is not yet available.

Instead, I use the knowledge that a large

energy gap in one-particle spectra for some deformation as a function of deformation (Nilsson

diagram) indicates the stability of the system for the deformation and the particle number.

Furthermore, I present the result only for prolate shape, because the number of medium-

heavy even-even nuclei, of which the ground state is observed to be oblate is so few, though

the overwhelming prolate dominance is so far not really understood. It is also noted that

there is no trivial reason why neutron-drip-line nuclei would prefer oblate shape, compared

with nuclei around the stability line.

In the present work I must explore the probabilities of the ℓ = 0 or ℓ = 1 component in the

wave function of the last-odd neutron in the laboratory system. When the even-even core

conﬁguration in a deformed odd-N nucleus is restricted to the ground state of the neighbor-

ing deformed even-even nucleus which has I = K = 0, the probabilities of (ℓ, j) components

of the wave function of the last-odd neutron in the deformed odd-N nucleus are obtained, in a

good approximation, from the angular-momentum projection of one-particle wave-functions

of the odd-neutron in corresponding deformed potentials. The good approximation is well

known from the analysis of one-nucleon transfer reactions such as (d,p) and (p,d) on the

deformed ground-state of even-even nuclei, when proper kinematic factors unique in respec-

tive reactions are taken into account. See, for example, Chapter 5-3 of Ref. [14]. In reality,

the even-even core conﬁgurations other than the ground-state conﬁguration may contribute

to the ground-state wave-functions of odd-N nuclei. However, the contributions by those

other conﬁgurations, for example the lowest-lying (K=0, I=2) conﬁguration or other excited

core-conﬁgurations mixed by rotational perturbation are pretty small in the ground and

band-head state of the neighboring odd-N nuclei. Therefore, in the following when I look

for possible deformed halo nuclei, I am satisﬁed by ﬁnding one-particle levels of the last-odd

neutron, of which the wave functions in deformed potentials contain an appreciable amount

of ℓ = 0 or ℓ = 1 component. In contrast, in spherical vibrational nuclei this approximation

of the ground state of odd-A nuclei consisting of the one-particle picture of the last-odd

particle and the ground state of the neighboring even-even nuclei can be a much poorer

approximation.

5

A.

even-Z odd-N nuclei around N=50

First, I ﬁgure out the level scheme of neutron one-particle levels as a function of axially-

symmetric quadrupole deformation for the nucleus, which can be one of good candidates

for deformed s-wave halo in the region of the neutron number 50. Then, I try to ﬁnd the
possible lightest ℓ = 0 neutron-halo nuclei heavier than 37Mg, using the data on Sn-values

of even-Z odd-N nuclei listed in Ref.

[15]. Some Sn values in Ref.

[15] are ”evaluated”

values, which I also use though those evaluated Sn-values have certainly an ambiguity that

is diﬃcult to be estimated. Using those evaluated Sn-values is the best which I can do for

the moment. In the following I mark those evaluated Sn-values by *.

First of all, it is clear that when I limit myself to spherical shape the possible ℓ = 0

neutron halo which I look for must have a considerable amount of the neutron 3s1/2 one-

particle component. In the shell-structure of spherical stable nuclei the 3s1/2 level is known

to appear in the second half of the major shell consisting of the neutron number N = 51-82.

In contrast, in the case of very weakly-bound neutrons the 3s1/2 level can be the lowest

one-particle level among the j-levels in the major shell consisting of N = 51-82 [6].

In

Fig.1 the neutron one-particle levels calculated in the Woods-Saxon potential, namely both

eigenenergies of bound neutrons for εΩ < 0 and one-particle resonant energies for εΩ > 0,

are shown as a function of axially-symmetric quadrupole-deformation parameter β. The
parameters of the potential are taken from those for the nucleus 76

26Fe50 except for the depth

of the Woods-Saxon potential, which is reduced by 1.6 MeV, and the strength of the spin-

orbit potential, which is about 80 percent of the standard value [12]. The reduction of the

depth by 1.6 MeV is made in order to make the 3s1/2 level at β=0 being bound, while the

80 percent spin-orbit strength is chosen in order just to avoid the complicated level-crossing

around β ≈ 0. The resulting shell-structure for β > 0 to be discussed in the following is

not really changed by these changes of the potential parameters. The lowest-lying Ωπ =
1/2+ level in Fig. 1 coming from the spherical Nho = 4 shell, which is denoted by [440 1/2]
and is connected to the 1g9/2 level at β = 0, does not contain an appreciable amount of

ℓ = 0 component for realistic values of quadrupole deformation β < 0.5, simply because of

the vanishing matrix-element of the Y20 operator between the 1g9/2 and 3s1/2 orbits. The

quadrupole coupling between the two orbits becomes eﬀective mainly via the neighboring

2d5/2 orbit, which couples with both the 1g9/2 and 3s1/2 orbits by the Y20 operator. For

6

example, the probability of ℓ=0 component in the wave function of the lowest-lying Ωπ =
1/2+ level in Fig. 1 is 0.014, 0.035 and 0.041 for β = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively.

Thus, except for the case that one-particle energy is extremely small, among the levels
coming from the Nho = 4 major shell in Fig. 1 the lowest-lying Ωπ = 1/2+ neutron level,
which for realistic values of β(< 0.5) contains an appreciable amount of the ℓ = 0 component,
is the second (or third) lowest Ωπ = 1/2+ level indicated as the [431 1/2] (or [420 1/2]) level.

Limiting myself to spherical or prolately deformed shape, the neutron numbers of which
the Fermi level may be placed on the second or third lowest Ωπ = 1/2+ level in Fig. 1

are N=47 with the [431 1/2] level for 0.18 < β < 0.38, N=49 with the [431 1/2] level for

0.10 < β < 0.18 and with the [420 1/2] level for 0.32 < β < 0.52, and N=51 with the [431

1/2] level for 0 ≤ β < 0.10 and with the [420 1/2] level for 0.19 < β < 0.32. In all the
bands constructed based on those Ωπ = 1/2+ one-particle levels the decoupling parameters

a are found to be in the range of −1 < a < +4 for the relevant deformations and, thus, the
band-head states in the laboratory system have the spin-parity 1/2+.

For Ni-isotopes the Sn-values of 71
3.2∗ MeV, respectively. Thus, though 79

28Ni43, 73

28Ni45, 75

28Ni47 and 77

28Ni49 are 4.3, 4.0, 3.9∗ and

28Ni51 would lie inside the neutron drip-line and be

presumably spherical, the Sn-value would not be small enough to expect that the nucleus
may show a possible halo. For Ti-isotopes the Sn-values of 55
and 63
69
22Ti47 may be expected to lie outside the neutron drip-line. Then, examining available data

22Ti39
22Ti41 are 4.1, 2.7, 2.6∗, 2.1∗ and 1.3∗ MeV, respectively. Therefore, the odd-N nucleus

22Ti35, 59

22Ti37, 61

22Ti33, 57

on nuclei towards the possible neutron drip-line, promising candidates for s-wave neutron-
halo nuclei are 71

26Fe51, in the case that those nuclei lie inside the

24Cr51 and 77

24Cr47, 73

24Cr49, 75

neutron drip-line. (The two neutron separation energies S2n of those nuclei are expected to

24Cr41 and 67

24Cr37,
24Cr43 are 4.0, 2.9, 2.6∗ and 2.0∗ MeV, respectively. For Fe-isotopes the

be positive so that the nuclei are stable against 2n emission.) The reason is the following:
The heaviest member of Cr-isotopes so far found was 70
24Cr39, 65
63
presence of 75
26Fe43 and
26Fe45 are 4.3, 4.0, 3.3∗ and 2.8∗ MeV, respectively. In short, the Sn-values of 71Cr, 73Cr,
71
75Cr and 77Fe may be less than 1 MeV, in the case that they are not negative.

26Fe49 was observed at MSU [16], while Sn-values of 65

24Cr46 [16] while Sn-values of 61

26Fe39, 67

26Fe41, 69

It is noted that the shell-structure for β > 0 consisting of both weakly-bound levels and

low-lying one-particle resonances in Fig. 1 remains almost quantitatively unchanged when

the depth of the Woods-Saxon potential is changed by, say less than 1.5 MeV so that some

7

of one-particle levels are changed from bound states to one-particle resonances or vice versa.
Therefore, Fig. 1 which is for the system [76Fe + n] is used to explore the possibility of

deformed s-wave halo in nuclei with N = 47, 49 and 51 which have weakly-bound neutrons.

The similarity of the neutron shell-structure above N=40 to that above N=20 for respec-

tive neutron-rich nuclei is sometimes pointed out, for example, see Ref. [10]. The latter leads

to the region of deformed nuclei called ”island of inversion”. For nuclei with weakly-bound

neutrons the spherical energy gap at N=50 becomes smaller as seen in Fig. 1 and, moreover,

four one-particle levels, 1g9/2, 3s1/2, 2d5/2 and 2d3/2, occur within a few MeV at β = 0. Con-

sequently, the ground states of those nuclei with N ≈ 41-51 may be deformed, if the proton

numbers of respective nuclei allow the deformation. The neutron number 51 is the sum of

N=40 and a half of the neutron number 22, which can be accommodated in the close-lying

shells consisting of 1g9/2, 3s1/2, 2d5/2 and 2d3/2. In this respect, it is interesting to note that
in the recent shell-model calculations in [17] the nuclei 74

26Fe50 are predicted to

24Cr50 and 76

be deformed, though in the calculation of Ref. [17] harmonic-oscillator wave-functions and

ESPEs (Eﬀective Single Particle Energies), which are adjusted based on the knowledge of

single-particle energies in nuclei far away from neutron-drip-line, are used. That means, the

important eﬀect of very weak bindings of neutrons on the neutron single-particle energies is

not taken into account in Ref. [17].

B.

even-Z odd-N nuclei around N=34

In this subsection I describe a possibility of halo phenomena related to the nucleus 53
18Ar35.
The presence of 53Ar inside the neutron drip-line was reported in MSU [18]. The proton

number Z = 18 does not seem to particularly favor prolate deformation, though some Ar
isotopes such as 48

18Ar30 can be interpreted as being deformed.

18Ar31 and 51

The heaviest member of Ar-isotopes so far found was 53Ar, while Sn-values of 45

18Ar27,
18Ar33 are 5.17(0.002), 3.55(0.08), 3.60(1.41) from Ref. [19] and 1.0∗ MeV,
47
18Ar29, 49
respectively. Thus, the Sn-value of 53Ar is expected to be small. If the nucleus is spherical
or slightly oblate, the spin-parity of the ground state is likely to be 5/2−. However, in the

following it is shown that if the nucleus is prolately deformed and the Sn-value is smaller

than, say several hundreds keV, there may be a chance for the ground state to show deformed

s-wave or p-wave halo phenomena.

8

As seen in Fig. 1, the possible lowest-lying Ωπ = 1/2+ one-particle level on the prolate

side coming from the Nho = 4 major shell is the one connected to the 1g9/2 level at β = 0. As
described in the previous subsection, this lowest-lying Ωπ = 1/2+ level contains usually only

less than a few percent probability of ℓ=0 component in the range of realistic quadrupole
deformation, say β < 0.5. The only exception is the case that this Ωπ = 1/2+ level has a

very small binding energy, say |εΩ| smaller than a few hundred keV. As described in [8, 9]

the probability of ℓ = 0 component in the one-particle neutron wave-function with Ωπ =
1/2+ approaches unity in the limit of |εΩ| → 0. The value of |εΩ|, at which the probability
of ℓ = 0 component starts to strongly increase, depends on respective Ωπ = 1/2+ orbits.

In Fig. 2 neutron one-particle energies are plotted as a function of axially-symmetric

quadrupole deformation parameter β, taking the standard parameters of Ref.
system of [52
18Ar34 + n]. Each orbit is doubly degenerate. Thus, if I take literally this ﬁgure,
the 35th neutron in 53Ar occupies the orbit with Ωπ = 5/2− for −0.16 < β < 0, Ωπ = 1/2−
for 0 < β < 0.13, Ωπ = 3/2− for 0.13 < β < 0.27 and Ωπ = 1/2+ for 0.27 < β < 0.41. When

[12] for the

I examine the wave functions of neutrons, I ﬁnd that for β < 0.05 the main component
of the Ωπ = 1/2− orbit will be f5/2, while that of the Ωπ = 3/2− orbit will be f5/2 for
β < 0.18. Therefore, deformed p-wave halo may not be obtained for respective β-values.

On the other hand, if the Sn-value is larger than about 400 keV the probability of ℓ=0
component in the wave function of the lowest-lying Ωπ = 1/2+ orbit is less than 0.10 and

the main components of the one-neutron wave-function become g9/2 and d5/2. Both the
calculated decoupling parameter of the Ωπ = 1/2− level for 0 < β < 0.3 and that of the Ωπ
= 1/2+ level for 0.24 < β < 0.5 are in the range of −1 < a < +4. Thus, in the absence of

band-mixing the spin-parity of the band-head states based on those one-particle orbits with
Ω = 1/2 would be Iπ = 1/2− and Iπ = 1/2+ in the range of respective deformations. On the

other hand, for 0 < β < 0.2 the one-particle energies |εΩ| of the very-weakly bound levels
with Ωπ = 1/2− and 3/2− are so close that the two conﬁgurations constructed based on

the two respective one-particle levels may be strongly mixed in observed states. It is rather

diﬃcult to say something more in the present stage since no spectroscopic information on the
nucleus 53Ar is available. Therefore, I would state that the condition literally obtained from
Fig. 2 is: the nucleus 53Ar is expected to show deformed p-wave halo if it has a moderate

deformation of β ≈ 0.20-0.25 while it will show deformed s-wave halo for β ≈ 0.25-0.40 if it

has an Sn-value smaller than a few hundred keV.

9

I add just one comment on the decoupling parameters of very weakly-bound Ω = 1/2 one-
particle levels. In the lowest-lying Ωπ = 1/2+ level in Fig. 2 connected to the 1g9/2 level at
β=0 the decoupling parameter generally increases as β(> 0) → 0 and approaches +5 which is

the value of the decoupling parameter for a j=9/2 particle. However, as β(> 0.24) → 0.24 in

Fig. 2, the value of |εΩ(< 0)| approaches zero and the probability of the ℓ = 0 component in

the one-particle wave-function steeply increases and approaches unity. Then, the decoupling

parameter of course approaches the value of +1, which is the value for a j=1/2 particle.

Though in order for the ground state of 53Ar to show halo phenomena the conditions

described above must be luckily satisﬁed, it would be very interesting if one can ﬁnd the

halo phenomena in the nucleus because it may exhibit exciting quantum-mechanical features

such as deformation, deformed shell-structure of weakly-bound neutrons, the possible strong
increase of ℓ=0 component in the wave-functions of very weakly-bound Ωπ = 1/2+ neutrons,
and so on. Since the presence and a presumably small Sn-value of the nucleus 53Ar are already

guaranteed, I hope a proper experiment will be carried out in the near future.

III. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

Recognizing that the nucleus 37Mg is so far the heaviest halo nucleus which was exper-

imentally found, one may wonder whether the halo phenomena can be found also in very
heavy nuclei. Then, a question is which nucleus heavier than 37Mg will be next found to show

the halo property. Using the shell structure unique in nuclei with weakly-bound neutrons,
I have tried to look for possible neutron-halo nuclei heavier than 37Mg to be next studied.

Candidates for such deformed s-wave halo nuclei are those with the neutron number N=47,

49 and 51. Examining available Sn-values of even-Z odd-N isotopes, promising nuclei are
24Cr47, 73
71

26Fe51. The ℓ=0 components in the wave functions of those possi-

24Cr51 and 77

24Cr49, 75

ble halo neutrons come mainly from the 3s1/2 level. And, one-neutron level which contains

an appreciable amount of the ℓ = 0 component is, except for the very weakly binding case
of the lowest-lying Ωπ = 1/2+ level, the second (or third)-lowest Ωπ = 1/2+ neutron level

among the levels coming from the spherical Nho=4 major shell. Those promising candidates

for halo nuclei are expected to be deformed because in the spherical limit the N=50 energy

gap is narrowed and a set of close-lying one-particle levels, 1g9/2, 3s1/2, 2d5/2 and 2d3/2,

appear.

10

In other words, the possible observation of an s-wave halo in the above N = 47, 49 and/or

51 nuclei directly suggests the shell-structure unique in very weakly-bound neutrons, such

as the disappearance of N = 50 magic number and the very lowering of the 3s1/2 level inside

the major shell 50 < N < 82.

Proper mean-ﬁeld calculations such as HF calculations to obtain nuclear shape have

not properly been carried out for those neutron-rich nuclei with weakly-bound neutrons

mainly because of the lack of the proper HF two-body interaction which has been established

for those nuclei. Under these circumstances I have used the fact that the presence of a

few close-lying one-particle levels in the spherical limit is known to lead to the prolately

deformed shape of nuclei when neutrons start to ﬁll the ﬁrst half of the close-lying levels

(Jahn-Teller eﬀect), though the possible presence of pair-correlation which acts against the

tendency of deformation may delay the occurrence of deformation in the beginning of the

ﬁrst half. Examples are the deformation of stable rare-earth nuclei with 90≤N≤112 [14] and

the deformation of neutron-rich Mg isotopes [5]. By the way, to my knowledge the reason

why very few oblately deformed nuclei with neutrons ﬁlling in the second half of a major

shell (or close-lying shells) are realized has not yet really been pinned down.

In the present work I had to use the ”evaluated” (or extrapolated) Sn-values in Ref. [15]

for some neutron-rich nuclei, which are often crucial to predict possible halo nuclei. There is

no other more-reliable way, therefore, I could not avoid that the resulting conclusion contains

the corresponding ambiguity.

The basis to expect that the nucleus 53Ar is prolately deformed is certainly weaker,

however, the interpretation of the observed prolate deformation of nuclei such as 31
[20] or 29
10Ne19 [21] in the region of island of inversion encourages the expectation. Namely,
as β(> 0) → large, one-particle levels with Ωπ = 1/2+ and Ωπ = 3/2+ originating from

12Mg19

the high-j (1g9/2 in the present case) shell energetically come down steeply in Fig. 2, and

the ﬁlling of those one-particle levels may help for the relevant nuclei to acquire prolate

deformation.

To my knowledge, in heavier stable nuclei the pair-correlation becomes important almost

whenever deformation is likely to occur. In the present work one-neutron wave-functions

in the absence of pair-correlation are used since the neutron-halo phenomena in the ground

state of odd-N nuclei are explored. It may be interesting to ﬁnd how halo phenomena in

heavier odd-N nuclei are aﬀected by a possible strong pair-correlation in the even-even core

nuclei.

Figure 1 : Calculated one-particle energies for neutrons in the potential given by the core

nucleus 76

26Fe50 as a function of axially-symmetric quadrupole deformation parameter

β. Bound one-particle energies at β = 0 are −6.56, −6.14, −5.39, −1.53, and −0.05

MeV for the 2p3/2, 1f5/2, 2p1/2, 1g9/2 and 3s1/2 levels respectively, while one-particle

resonant 2d5/2, 2d3/2 and 1g7/2 levels are obtained at 0.25, 1.62 and 3.12 MeV (denoted
by ﬁlled circles) with the width of 0.024, 1,92 and 0.13 MeV, respectively. The Ωπ
= 1/2+ resonant level connected to the 2d5/2 level at β = 0 cannot be obtained as a
one-particle resonant level for β > 0.007. Three bound Ωπ = 1/2+ levels are denoted

by the asymptotic quantum-numbers on the prolate side [14], [NnzΛΩ] = [440 1/2],

[431 1/2] and [420 1/2], although the wave-functions of those levels plotted in this

ﬁgure are quite diﬀerent from those expressed by the asymptotic quantum-numbers.

The neutron numbers, 40, 48 and 50, which are obtained by ﬁlling all lower-lying

levels, are indicated with circles, for reference. For simplicity, calculated widths of

one-particle resonant levels are not shown. The parity of levels can be seen from the

ℓ-values denoted at β = 0; π = (−1)ℓ. One-particle resonant energies for β 6= 0 are

not always plotted if they are not important for the present discussions.

Figure 2 : Calculated one-particle energies for neutrons in the potential given by the core

nucleus 52

18Ar34 as a function of axially-symmetric quadrupole deformation. Bound one-

particle energies at β = 0 are −5.99, −3.18, −1.63 and −0.31 MeV for the 1f7/2, 2p3/2,

2p1/2 and 1f5/2 levels, respectively, while one-particle resonant 1g9/2 level is obtained

at 2.69 MeV with the width of 0.061 MeV. The 2d5/2 level is not obtained as a one-

particle resonant level for this potential. The neutron numbers, 28 and 34, which

are obtained by ﬁlling all lower-lying levels, are indicated with circles. One-particle

resonant energies for β 6= 0 are not always plotted if they are not important for the

present discussions.
