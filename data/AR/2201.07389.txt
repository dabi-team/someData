Abstract We investigate the transverse coronal-loop oscillations induced by the
eruption of a prominence-carrying ﬂux rope on 7 December 2012. The ﬂux rope
originating from NOAA Active Region (AR) 11621 was observed in extreme-
ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft and in Hα line center
by the ground-based telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The
early evolution of the ﬂux rope is divided into two steps: a slow rise phase at
a speed of ≈230 km s−1 and a fast rise phase at a speed of ≈706 km s−1. The
eruption generates a C5.8 ﬂare and the onset of the fast rise is consistent with
the hard X-ray (HXR) peak time of the ﬂare. The embedded prominence has
a lower speed of ≈452 km s−1. The eruption is signiﬁcantly inclined from the
local solar normal by ≈60◦, suggesting a typical non-radial eruption. During
the early eruption of the ﬂux rope, the nearby coronal loops are disturbed and
experience independent kink-mode oscillations in the horizontal and vertical
directions. The oscillation in the horizontal direction has an initial amplitude
of ≈3.1 Mm, a period of ≈294 seconds, and a damping time of ≈645 seconds. It
is most striking in 171 ˚A and lasts for three to four cycles. The oscillations in
the vertical directions are observed mainly in 171, 193, and 211 ˚A. The initial
amplitudes lie in the range of 3.4 – 5.2 Mm, with an average value of 4.5 Mm.
The periods are between 407 seconds and 441 seconds, with an average value of
423 seconds. The oscillations are damping and last for nearly four cycles. The
damping times lie in the range of 570 – 1012 seconds, with an average value of
741 seconds. Assuming a semi-circular shape of the vertically oscillating loops,
we calculate the loop lengths according to their heights. Using the observed
periods, we carry out coronal seismology and estimate the internal Alfv´en speeds

Q. M. Zhang et al.

1. Introduction

A magnetic ﬂux rope is a bundle of twisted ﬁeld lines that wind around their
common axis (see Liu, 2020, and references therein). The accumulated twist
number [Tw] can reach up to one to three turns (Liu et al., 2016; Guo et al.,
2021a). Flux ropes play an essential role in the genesis of solar eruptions (Chen,
2017; Cheng, Guo, and Ding, 2017), including prominence eruptions (Rust and
Kumar, 1996; Amari, Canou, and Aly, 2014), ﬂares (Titov and D´emoulin, 1999;
Janvier, Aulanier, and D´emoulin, 2015; Wang et al., 2015), and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs: Dere et al., 1999; Vourlidas et al., 2013; Patsourakos et al.,
2020). It is still controversial whether ﬂux ropes are generated before eruptions
(Canou et al., 2009; Green and Kliem, 2009; Zhang, Cheng, and Ding, 2012;
Zhang, Su, and Ji, 2017; James et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019;
He et al., 2020; Nindos et al., 2020) or during eruptions (Cheng et al., 2011;
Gou et al., 2019). Photospheric ﬂux cancellation is found to be important in
the formation of ﬂux ropes before eruptions (Green, Kliem, and Wallace, 2011;
Savcheva et al., 2012), while tether-cutting magnetic reconnection in the corona
is believed to be an eﬀective mechanism of ﬂux-rope formation during eruptions
(Joshi, Magara, and Inoue, 2014; Xue et al., 2017). Flux ropes are frequently
observed to have very high temperatures (≈10 MK), which are best revealed in
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) 94 ˚A and 131 ˚A and therefore termed “hot channel”
(Cheng et al., 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). Nindos et al. (2015) analyzed 141 M-class
and X-class ﬂares. About 32 % of the events are associated with hot channels
and almost half of the eruptive events are related to a hot channel conﬁguration.
The directions of prominence eruptions and associated CMEs are not always
radial. McCauley et al. (2015) investigated the properties of 904 prominence and
ﬁlament eruptions observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in detail.
It is found that the percentage of non-radial eruptions reaches 12 %. Devi et al.
(2021) reported a non-radial prominence eruption away from the local vertical
with an inclination angle of γ = 48◦, which is attributed to the easier channel
provided by the open and high-lying magnetic ﬁeld. Using stereoscopic observa-
tions from the twin spacecraft of the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
(STEREO: Kaiser et al., 2008), Gosain et al. (2009) observed a partial ﬁlament
eruption that was highly inclined to the solar normal with an inclination angle
of γ = 47◦, which is close to that reported by Williams et al. (2005). Combining
the observations from the STEREO-Ahead (hereafter STA) and the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) onboard SDO, Sun et al. (2012a)
reported a non-radial, jet-like eruption following a markedly inclined trajectory
with γ = 66◦. Combining the observations from STEREO-Behind (hereafter
STB) and SDO/AIA, Bi et al. (2013) investigated the rotation and non-radial

propagation of a ﬁlament, the later of which resulted from interaction between
the ﬁlament eruption and the overlying pseudo-streamer. In an extreme case,
a nearly 90◦ deﬂected ﬁlament eruption and the related CME were noticed
by Yang et al. (2018). State-of-the-art numerical simulations indicate that the
imbalance of the bipole leads to a negative magnetic pressure gradient in the x-
direction, which prevents the ﬂux rope from expanding symmetrically (Aulanier
et al., 2010; Kliem et al., 2013; Inoue et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018). Guo et al.
(2021b) performed a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a C7.7 class
ﬂare, which was generated by a non-radial prominence eruption on 21 June 2011
(Zhou et al., 2017).

Solar eruptions can potentially generate kink-mode, transverse oscillations of
the adjacent coronal loops (Aschwanden et al., 1999; Nakariakov et al., 1999;
Zimovets and Nakariakov, 2015) and quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP: Zimovets
et al., 2021). The polarization of the transverse loop oscillations could be hor-
izontal (White and Verwichte, 2012; Nistic`o, Nakariakov, and Verwichte, 2013;
Li et al., 2017, 2018; Zhang et al., 2015, 2020; Zhang, 2020; Dai et al., 2021) or
vertical (Wang and Solanki, 2004; Gosain, 2012; White, Verwichte, and Foullon,
2012; Sim˜oes et al., 2013; Srivastava and Goossens, 2013; Kim, Nakariakov, and
Cho, 2014; Dud´ık et al., 2016; Verwichte and Kohutova, 2017; Reeves et al.,
2020). In most cases, the amplitudes of kink oscillations decay with time as a
result of resonant absorption, phase mixing, wave leakage, or Kelvin–Helmholtz
instability (Goossens, Andries, and Aschwanden, 2002; Ofman and Aschwan-
den, 2002; Ruderman and Roberts, 2002; Terradas, Oliver, and Ballester, 2006;
Goddard et al., 2016; Antolin et al., 2017; Nechaeva et al., 2019). The damping
time [τ ] is roughly proportional to the period [P ] (Verwichte et al., 2013), and
the quality factor [ τ
P ] has a power-law dependence on the amplitude with the
exponent of -0.5 (Goddard and Nakariakov, 2016). One of the applications of
coronal seismology is the estimation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld and Alfv´en
speed of the oscillating loops (Nakariakov and Ofman, 2001; Aschwanden et al.,
2002; Verwichte et al., 2009; Chen and Peter, 2015). So far, there are few re-
ports of transverse coronal-loop oscillations triggered by non-radial prominence
eruptions.

On 7 December 2012, a prominence-carrying ﬂux rope erupted from NOAA
Active Region (AR) 11621 (N15W91) and propagated non-radially, producing a
C5.8 ﬂare and a fast CME. Based on the revised cone model, Zhang (2021) per-
formed a 3D reconstruction of the CME simultaneously observed by SDO/AIA
and STA/EUVI at 21:20:30 UT. The geometry and kinematics of the CME were
derived. In this article, we report the simultaneous coronal-loop oscillations in
the horizontal and vertical directions induced by the eruption in the same AR.
Data analysis is described in Section 2. The results are presented in Section 3
and compared with previous ﬁndings in Section 4. Finally, a brief summary is
given in Section 5.

rope was detected by SDO/AIA in EUV wavelengths (131, 171, 193, and 211 ˚A).
The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the photosphere were observed by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012) onboard SDO.
The AIA and HMI level 1 data were calibrated using the standard Solar Software
(SSW) program aia prep.pro and hmi prep.pro, respectively. The Hα and EUV
images were coaligned using the cross-correlation method.

The eruption was also captured by the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI)
in the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI:
Howard et al., 2008) package onboard STA, which had a separation angle of
≈128◦ with respect to the Sun–Earth direction on 7 December 2012. The CME
driven by the ﬂux-rope eruption was observed by the C2 white light (WL)
coronagraph of the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronalgraph (LASCO: Brueckner
et al., 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The
LASCO/C2 data were calibrated using the SSW program c2 calibrate.pro. The
CME was observed by the COR2 coronagraph onboard STA as well. Calibrations
of the COR2 and EUVI data were performed using the SSW program sec-
chi prep.pro. The deviation of STA north–south direction from the solar rotation
axis was corrected. The soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂuxes of the C5.8 ﬂare were recorded
by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) spacecraft.
The hard X-ray (HXR) ﬂuxes at diﬀerent energy bands were obtained from the
the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM: Meegan et al., 2009) onboard the Fermi
spacecraft. The observational properties of the instruments are listed in Table 1.

3.1. Eruption of the Prominence-carrying Magnetic Flux Rope

In Figure 1, the upper panel shows the SXR light curves of the C5.8 ﬂare in 1 – 8 ˚A
(red line) and 0.5 – 4 ˚A (blue line). It is clear that the SXR ﬂux increases rapidly
from ≈21:13:00 UT and reaches the peak value at ≈21:21:15 UT (black-dashed
line) before declining gradually to the pre-ﬂare level around 22:13:00 UT. Hence,

the lifetime of the ﬂare is ≈1 hr. Figure 1b shows the HXR light curves at 4 –
11 keV (orange line) and 11 – 26 keV (yellow line). The black-dashed line denotes
the HXR peak time at ≈21:18:00 UT when the rate of energy precipitation of
ﬂare-accelerated nonthermal electrons is maximum (Brown, 1971).

Four selected LOS magetograms from 4 December to 7 December 2012 are
displayed in Figure 2. It is seen that AR 11621 was still distinguishable on 5
December. As time goes by, it got blurred on 6 December close to the western
limb and totally vanished on 7 December, implying that it had rotated to the
backside of the Sun when the ﬂare took place.

The EUV images in Figure 3 illustrate the evolution of the prominence-
carrying ﬂux rope (see also the Electronic Supplementary Material animaia.mp4).
As the ﬂare occurs, the ﬂux rope shows up before 21:18:00 UT (a2 – d2). The
bubble-like ﬂux rope expands in size and propagates in the southwest direction.
An embedded prominence follows the ﬂux rope. It is obvious that the trajectory
is severely inclined to the solar normal with γ = 60◦, meaning that the event is
a typical non-radial eruption (Zhang, 2021). The thin leading edge of the ﬂux
rope could not be tracked after escaping the ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of AIA around
21:21:40 UT. The eruption is evident in various EUV wavelengths, suggesting

the multi-thermal nature of ﬂux rope and prominence (Hannah and Kontar,
2013). We note that a group of coronal loops to the North of the ﬂux rope are
slightly disturbed during the eruption and oscillate for a long time, which will
be described in Section 3.2.

The prominence eruption is also vivid in Hα line center (see animation in the
Electronic Supplementary Material animha.mp4). Figure 4 shows the Hα images
observed by BBSO. The prominence arises slowly at ≈21:16:00 UT and expands
quickly, resembling a tennis racket (see Panel d). The top segment is ﬁtted

with an ellipse (dotted line), whose major axis and minor axis have lengths
of 86(cid:48)(cid:48) and 64(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. The location and shape of the prominence are
consistent with that observed in EUV wavelengths (see Figure 3a4 – d4) and are
in agreement with the typical U-shaped prominence horns both in observation
(R´egnier, Walsh, and Alexander, 2011) and numerical simulations (Xia et al.,
2014). The prominence continues ascending and the top segment escapes the
FOV of BBSO. It is noticed that the bubble-like ﬂux rope in EUV wavelengths
is not distinct in Hα.

To investigate the evolution of ﬂux rope and prominence, we select a slice (S1)
with a total length of ≈296(cid:48)(cid:48) along the direction of their propagation, which is
shown in Figure 3d2. The time–distance diagrams of S1 in 131, 171, 193, and
211 ˚A are displayed in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the positions of the ﬂux rope
leading edge are labeled with a magenta dashed line, whose slope represents its
apparent linear speed (≈706 km s−1). The positions of the following prominence
are labeled with red-dashed lines, whose slopes represent its apparent linear
speed (≈452 km s−1). Hence, the speed of the ﬂux rope is ≈1.5 times larger than
the prominence.

As mentioned in Section 1, the eruption of the ﬂux rope drives a fast and
wide CME. In Figure 6, the upper and lower panels show the WL images of the
CME observed by LASCO/C2 and STA/COR2, respectively. The leading fronts
of the CME are pointed to by the arrows. The CME ﬁrst appears at ≈21:36:00
UT in the LASCO/C2 FOV and propagates westward with a central position
angle of 299◦. The CME ﬁrst appears at ≈22:24:00 UT in the STA/COR2 FOV

and propagates eastward until ≈23:54:00 UT, when the CME becomes too weak
to be identiﬁed. It is shown that although the ﬂux rope propagates non-radially
in the FOV of AIA, the position angle of the related CME is close to the latitude
of AR 11621, implying that the ﬂux rope is probably inﬂuenced and redirected
by the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld.

In Figure 7, the upper panel shows the height evolution of the ﬂux rope
leading edge in 131 ˚A, which is determined manually in the direction of S1. The
movement of the ﬂux rope is roughly divided into two phases by the HXR peak
(black-dashed line): a slow rise (≈230 km s−1) and a fast rise (≈706 km s−1),
which is in line with previous observations (Cheng et al., 2013). The height
evolution of the CME leading front in the FOV of LASCO/C2 is plotted in the
lower panel of Figure 7. The apparent speed (≈684 km s−1) of CME is indicated.
Taking the projection eﬀect into account, the speeds of the ﬂux rope and CME
are comparable, validating that the ﬂux rope serves as a driver of the CME
(Cheng et al., 2013).

available in the Electronic Supplementary Material (anim195.mp4).

The prominence eruption was observed by STA/EUVI from a diﬀerent view-
point (see animation in the Electronic Supplementary Material anim195.mp4).
Four 195 ˚A base-diﬀerence images are displayed in Figure 8. In Panel a, the
source region of the ﬂare and CME is located at (-590(cid:48)(cid:48), 300(cid:48)(cid:48)) as indicated
by the arrow. In Panel b, the arc-shaped CME leading front with enhanced
intensity is pointed by the arrow. In Panels c – d, long-lasting coronal dimming
behind the CME with reduced intensity and expanding area is the most striking
feature (Thompson et al., 1998; Zhang, Su, and Ji, 2017). It is evident that as
the CME propagates in the southeast direction, the dimming mainly extends in
the south and east directions, rather than isotropically.

3.2. Transverse Coronal-Loop Oscillations

As mentioned before, the coronal loops to the North of the prominence are dis-
turbed and start oscillating during the eruption (see animation in the Electronic
Supplementary Material animaia.mp4). In Figure 3d1, two slices (S2 and S3) are
used to investigate the transverse oscillations. The slightly curved slice S2 with a
total length of ≈188.5(cid:48)(cid:48) is parallel to the solar surface. The straight slice S3 with
a length of ≈172(cid:48)(cid:48) is vertical to the solar surface. The time–distance diagram
of S2 in 171 ˚A is displayed in Figure 9. The positions of the oscillating loop
with maximal EUV intensity are denoted by the magenta-plus symbols. After
the ﬂare occurs, the coronal loop ﬁrst moves southward and sways from side to
side periodically. The amplitude decays with time and the oscillation lasts for
three to four cycles. The initial southward movement is caused by the strong
magnetic-pressure gradient after the ﬂux rope quickly escapes the active region.
In Figure 10c, the positions of the oscillating loop along S2 are drawn with
cyan circles. To precisely determine the physical parameters of the oscillation,
we perform curve ﬁtting by adopting an exponentially decaying sine function
(Nistic`o, Nakariakov, and Verwichte, 2013):

and k and c denote the coeﬃcients of linear and quadratic terms, respectively.
The results of curve ﬁtting using mpﬁt.pro are drawn with a magenta-dotted line.
It is evident that the transverse oscillation can be nicely described by Equation 1.

τ (≈645 s), and τ

be emphasized that the transverse oscillation in the horizontal direction is most
striking in 171 ˚A and becomes blurred in 193 and 211 ˚A.

The time–distance diagrams of S3 in 171, 193, and 211 ˚A are displayed in

Interestingly, the coronal loops start to oscillate vertically after the ﬂare occurs.

cycles. The initial inward motion indicates loop contraction or implosion before
oscillation (e.g. Gosain, 2012; Sun et al., 2012b; Sim˜oes et al., 2013; Dud´ık et al.,
2016). This is consistent with the fact that the vertical loop oscillations are
caused by the eruption of the ﬂux rope, since the magnetic pressure beneath the
loops is impulsively decreased after the eruption.

The positions of the loop tops in 171, 193, and 211 ˚A are manually determined
and are drawn with blue circles in Figure 10. Likewise, we perform curve ﬁtting
by adopting an exponentially decaying sine function:

where the parameters have the same meanings as in Equation 1. The results
of curve ﬁtting are drawn with red-dotted lines, showing that the vertical os-
cillations can be well described by Equation 2. In Table 2, the ﬁtted values
of t0, A0, P , τ , and τ
P are listed in the second to sixth columns. The initial
amplitudes lie in the range of 3.4 – 5.2 Mm with an average value of ≈4.5 Mm.
The periods have a range of 407 – 441 s with an average value of ≈423 s. The
damping times are between 570 s and 1012 s with an average value of ≈741
s. The corresponding quality factors ( τ
P ) are between 1.4 and 2.3 with a mean
value of ≈1.7, suggesting a quick attenuation (White, Verwichte, and Foullon,
2012). In 171 ˚A, the period of oscillation in the vertical direction is ≈1.5 times
longer than that in the horizontal direction, while the quality factors are close
to each other, indicating that the transverse oscillations in both directions are
independent rather than two components of the same oscillation. In Table 2,
the apparent heights of the loop tops are listed in the seventh column. The loop
heights in 193 and 211 ˚A are higher than those in 171 ˚A with lower temperature
of the response function peak (Lemen et al., 2012). In other words, the coronal
loops with diﬀerent heights oscillate in phase (Zhang et al., 2020).

The commencements of oscillations in both horizontal and vertical directions
occur during the fast rise of the ﬂux rope (Figure 7a), which is in accordance

with the fact that the transverse oscillations are caused by the ﬂux-rope eruption.
That is to say, the coronal loops are not disturbed until the ﬂux rope expands
and propagates after a time. It is emphasized that the simultaneous oscillations
in the horizontal direction and vertical directions are from diﬀerent coronal loops
superposed along the LOS, since the coronal loop undergoing horizontal oscilla-
tion drifts southward from the equilibrium position (see Figure 9). Moreover, the
period of vertical oscillation is 1.5 times longer than the horizontal oscillation in
171 ˚A.

4. Discussion

4.1. What is the Cause of Non-radial Eruption?

As mentioned in Section 1, non-radial prominence eruptions are frequently ob-
served (e.g. Williams et al., 2005; Gosain et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012a; Bi et al.,
2013; Panasenco et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018; Mitra and Joshi, 2019; Devi
et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2021b; Mancuso et al., 2021). The reported inclination
angle is between 45◦ and 90◦. The non-radial eruption is attributed to the
imbalance of magnetic pressure of the high-lying ﬁeld (Aulanier et al., 2010). In
the current case, the apparent inclination angle of the ﬂux rope is 60◦. We obtain
the global 3D magnetic conﬁguration at 18:04:00 UT using the potential-ﬁeld
source surface (PFSS: Schrijver and De Rosa, 2003) modeling. Figure 12 shows
the conﬁguration from the viewpoints of SDO (a) and STA (b), respectively.
Combining Figure 12 and Figure 3, it is revealed that the ﬂux rope ﬁnds a way
out where the magnetic ﬁeld is weaker and the escape becomes easier. This is
consistent with the previous interpretation (Aulanier et al., 2010).

4.2. How are the Transverse Loop Oscillations Excited?

Two decades have passed since the discovery of coronal-loop oscillations (see
Li et al., 2020; Nakariakov and Kolotkov, 2020; Nakariakov et al., 2021; Wang
et al., 2021, and references therein). Kink oscillation has become a topic of
great interest due to its advantage in diagnosing the coronal magnetic ﬁeld
(Yang et al., 2020). There are several candidates in exciting kink oscillations,
such as ﬂare-induced blast waves (Nakariakov et al., 1999; Zhang, 2020), large-
scale coronal waves (Kumar et al., 2013), coronal jets (Dai et al., 2021), lower
coronal eruptions/ejections (LCE: Zimovets and Nakariakov, 2015), coronal rains
(Antolin and Verwichte, 2011), and reconnection outﬂows (Reeves et al., 2020).
A common characteristic of the above excitation mechanisms is that the coronal
loops start oscillating after being impacted. In our case, a pressure depletion is
created as a result of the non-radial ﬂux-rope eruption. Hence, the transverse
loop oscillations are driven by the strong magnetic-pressure gradient of the loops
(see animaia.mp4), which is rarely noticed and reported. Numerical simulations
are desired to justify this mechanism.

In Figure 9 and Figure 11, there are several oscillating threads with non-
zero phase diﬀerences compared to the analyzed loops. This is probably because
a bundle of loops with diﬀerent lengths and periods oscillate simultaneously
(White and Verwichte, 2012; Nistic`o, Nakariakov, and Verwichte, 2013). We focus
on oscillations with clear and complete signals. It is emphasized that our anal-
ysis has LOS limitations in classifying oscillations into horizontal and vertical
types based on single-point observation. The possibility of elliptically polarized
transverse oscillations that are decomposed into two linearly polarized modes
with diﬀerent periods could not be excluded. Forward modeling and multi-point
observations are required to clarify the polarization of kink oscillations (White,
Verwichte, and Foullon, 2012).

4.3. Magnetic Field Estimated from Coronal Seismology

To estimate the magnetic ﬁeld of the loops undergoing vertical oscillations,
we use the observed periods and coronal seismology. The phase speed [Ck] of
the standing kink oscillation is determined by the loop length [L] and period
(Nakariakov et al., 1999):

(cid:115)

Ck =

2L
P

=

where CA is the internal Alfv´en speed, and ρe and ρi represent the external and
internal plasma densities. The lengths of the oscillating loops are listed in the
eighth column of Table 2 based on a semi-circular shape. The corresponding
values of Ck and CA are listed in the ninth and tenth columns, assuming that
ρe/ρi = 0.1 (Nakariakov and Ofman, 2001).

√

The magnetic-ﬁeld strength of the oscillating loops is determined by ρi and
4πρiCA. Since the LOS depths of the oscillating loops are diﬃcult
CA, B =
to measure, we could not determine ρi precisely. Assuming that ρi is between

Q. M. Zhang et al.

1.1×10−15 g cm−3 and 1.1×10−14 g cm−3, corresponding to the electron number
density between 0.7×109 cm−3 and 7×109 cm−3 (e.g. Nakariakov and Ofman,
2001; Van Doorsselaere et al., 2008; Verwichte et al., 2009, 2013; Yuan and Van
Doorsselaere, 2016; Dai et al., 2021), the magnetic-ﬁeld strengths of the loops
observed in diﬀerent wavelengths are calculated and listed in the last column of
Table 2. Hence, the magnetic ﬁelds of the vertically oscillating loops fall in the
range of 12 – 43 G. It is noted that the estimated magnetic ﬁeld using coronal
seismology has large uncertainties. On one hand, the plasma density could not
be precisely determined, so that a wide range is adopted according to previous
literature. On the other hand, the shape of the loops is unknown, so that a
simple semi-circular shape is employed. Besides, the apparent heights [h] and
corresponding lengths [L] of the loops are lower limits of the true values. The
estimations of Ck, CA, and B in Table 2 are lower limits as well. Considering that
the loops undergoing horizontal and vertical oscillations are heavily superposed
along the LOS, the height of oscillating loop in the horizontal direction is hard
to determine. Therefore, the horizontal oscillation is not used for seismology.

5. Summary

In this article, we investigate the transverse coronal loop oscillations induced by
the eruption of a prominence-carrying ﬂux rope on 7 December 2012. The main
results are as follows:

1. The ﬂux rope originating from AR 11621 is observed in various EUV wave-
lengths, suggesting its multi-thermal nature. The early evolution of the ﬂux
rope is divided into two phases: a slow rise phase at a speed of ≈230 km s−1
and a fast rise phase at a speed of ≈706 km s−1. The eruption generates a
C5.8 ﬂare and the onset of fast rise is consistent with the HXR peak time
of the ﬂare. The embedded prominence has a lower speed of ≈452 km s−1.
The propagation of the ﬂux rope is along the southwest direction in the
FOV of AIA. Hence, the inclination angle between the direction of ﬂux
rope eruption and the local solar normal reaches ≈60◦, suggesting a typical
non-radial eruption.

2. During the early eruption of the ﬂux rope, the nearby coronal loops are
disturbed and experience kink-mode oscillations. The oscillation in the hori-
zontal direction has an initial amplitude of ≈3.1 Mm, a period of ≈294 s, and
a damping time of ≈645 s. It is most striking in 171 ˚A and lasts for three to
four cycles. The oscillations in the vertical directions are observed mainly in
171, 193, and 211 ˚A. The initial amplitudes lie in the range of 3.4 – 5.2 Mm,
with an average value of 4.5 Mm. The periods are between 407 seconds and
441 seconds, with an average value of 423 seconds (≈7 minutes). The oscil-
lations are damping and last for nearly four cycles. The damping times lie
in the range of 570 – 1012 seconds, with an average value of 741 seconds.
3. Assuming a semi-circular shape of the vertically oscillating loops, we cal-
culate the loop lengths according to their heights. Using the observed pe-
riods, we carry out coronal seismology and estimate the internal Alfv´en
speeds (988 – 1145 km s−1) and the magnetic-ﬁeld strengths (12 – 43 G) of
the oscillating loops.
