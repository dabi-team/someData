Highly accurate measurements of the g factor of boronlike Ar are currently implemented within
the ARTEMIS experiment at GSI (Darmstadt, Germany) and within the ALPHATRAP experiment
at the MPIK (Heidelberg, Germany). A comparison with the corresponding theoretical predictions
will allow one to test the modern methods of bound-state QED. However, at least three diﬀerent
theoretical values of the g factor have been published up to date. The systematic study of the g-
factor value of 40Ar13+ in the ground [(1s)2(2s)22p1]2P1/2 and the ﬁrst excited [(1s)2(2s)22p1]2P3/2
states is performed within the high order coupled cluster and conﬁguration interaction theories up
to the full conﬁguration interaction treatment. Correlation contributions are discussed and results
are compared with previous studies.

INTRODUCTION

Experiments on few-electron ions of heavy atoms are of
great importance to test bound-state QED [1, 2]. Highly
accurate results for g factor [3–9] and hyperﬁne struc-
ture [10, 11] have already been obtained for H-like and
Li-like systems. In particular, the most accurate value
of the electron mass (almost by two orders of magnitude
more precise than the value from the independent mea-
surements) has been obtained in the study of g factor
of highly charged ions [8]. An independent determina-
tion of the ﬁne-structure constant α is expected from
the g-factor measurements in few-electron ions [12–14].
Combined experimental and theoretical studies of the g
factor and hyperﬁne structure can be used to obtain the
values of the nuclear magnetic moments [15–18].

The ARTEMIS experiment [19, 20] at GSI imple-
ments the laser-microwave double-resonance technique
with the ﬁne or hyperﬁne structure of highly charged
ions.
In particular, it can yield the Zeeman splitting
in the boronlike argon 40Ar13+ ion (with spinless nu-
cleus) in the ground [(1s)2(2s)22p1]2P1/2 and excited
[(1s)2(2s)22p1]2P3/2 states at the ppb level of accuracy.
Apart from the g factor of these states, it will also pro-
vide the possibility to measure the nonlinear Zeeman ef-
fect [19, 21]. The ALPHATRAP experiment [22] at the
Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Kernphysik (MPIK) aims at the
high-precision g-factor determination using the Larmor
and cyclotron frequency measurements following the ear-
lier experiments performed at the Mainz University [3–9].
Previously several theoretical values of g factor have
been reported which are in a certain disagreement be-
tween each other: 0.663 647(1) [23], 0.663 728 [24],
and 0.663 899(2) [25]. As noted in Ref. [25], the dif-
ference between these values is within the accuracy of
the ARTEMIS experiment [19]. This discrepancy can be
explained by the diﬀerent methods used in these works
to obtain the electron-electron interaction contributions.
All the other terms such as nuclear recoil and high-order

(beyond the free-electron part) QED contributions cal-
culated in Refs. [23, 26] are much smaller than the dif-
ference. Thus, an independent calculation of g factor is
of high importance.

It was shown that for such properties as g factor [27],
enhancement factors of the electron electric dipole mo-
ment, eﬀective electric ﬁeld, and hyperﬁne structure [28–
35] in atoms and molecules the coupled cluster theory
gives very accurate results.
It allows one to eﬃciently
sum perturbation theory series up to an inﬁnite order.
Even for these neutral (or weakly charged) atoms and
molecules the main uncertainty of the results were due
to neglect or approximate inclusion of the Breit interac-
tion.

The present paper is focused on the theoretical study
of the boron like Ar ion within the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit
Hamiltonian with accounting eﬀects of electron correla-
tions in all orders of perturbation theory.

THEORY

The ﬁrst order Zeeman shift of the 2PJ state in the
spinless-nucleus ion with the angular momentum projec-
tion MJ is directly related to the g factor:

∆E(1) = gMJ µ0B,

(1)

where µ0 = |e|¯h
2mc is the Bohr magneton. Thus the atomic
magnetic moment (and g factor) is determined by the
ﬁrst derivative of the energy with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld B at zero ﬁeld.

In the four-component Dirac theory, Zeeman Hamilto-

nian can be written in the following form:

HZ = µ0

[ri × αi] · B,

(2)

i
X

where α is the vector of the Dirac matrices and i is an
electron index; summation goes over all the electrons in
the system.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Contribution of the QED to the atomic magnetic mo-
ment (and g factor) outside the Breit approximation can
be approximately estimated as an expectation value of
the following operator [36]:

and ge = 2.0023193 . . . is the free-electron g factor.

action is given by the following operator:

(4)

where αi and αj act on variables of ith and jth elec-
trons, correspondingly. This operator is the ﬁrst QED
correction to the Coulomb term and includes both the
magnetic interaction (Gaunt) and “retardation” eﬀects.
Note that due to the oﬀ-diagonal structure of α matrices
HB and HZ couple large and small bispinor components.
Therefore, negative energy states can be of great impor-
tance for accurate calculation of g factor. A similar eﬀect
is well known in the calculation of the shielding constants
(see, e.g., [37, 38]).

The coupled cluster (CC) approach [39–42] is one of
the most successful methods to consider dynamic electron
correlation eﬀects. It is based on the exponential ansatz
for the wave function Ψ:

ΨCC = e

ˆT Φ0.

(5)

For the single-reference case Φ0 is a one-determinant
wave function of a system obtained in some approxima-
tion, e.g., within the Dirac-Fock method. ˆT is the ex-
citation cluster operator which is expanded in terms of
diﬀerent excitation orders:

indexes in correspond to occupied orbitals while bm cor-
respond to unoccupied ones; ain is the annihilation oper-
ator of the state in and a†
bm is the creation operator of the
state bm, tb1b2...bk
i1i2...ik are unknown cluster amplitudes to be
determined [39–42]. Truncation of the ˆT operator at ˆT2
leads to the coupled cluster with single and double cluster

2

amplitudes, CCSD, etc. In the coupled cluster technique
[39–42] Schr¨odinger equation HΨCC = EΨCC is reduced
to a nonlinear equation system with unknown cluster am-
plitudes and energy and is solved iteratively. From the
perturbation theory (PT) point of view, even truncated
CC methods include some terms of PT (in interelectron
interaction) up to an inﬁnite order due to the exponen-
tial ansatz. For example, the coupled cluster with single,
double, triple, and quadruple cluster amplitudes, CCS-
DTQ, [or its approximation CCSDT(Q) [43]] which was
used in the present paper (see below) includes all terms
of PT up to order six and some terms up to an inﬁ-
nite order. The CCSDT theory [and its approximation
CCSD(T)] includes all terms of PT of the fourth order
(and some terms up to an inﬁnite order). Contrary to
the CC theory, the conﬁguration interaction (CI) method
uses a linear ansatz instead of the exponential one in
Eq.(5). If n in Eq. (6) equals the number of electrons in
the system the CC and CI methods will give the same
exact (full CI) wavefunction (within the given basis set,
Hamiltonian and in no-pair approximation).

ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATION
DETAILS

In all calculations we used Gaussian basis sets. For
the main Dirac-Coulomb-Breit calculation the Dyall’s
ACV4Z basis set [44] with excluded f - and g- type func-
tions has been used. This basis set includes 25s, 15p
and 9d functions for large component and in the fol-
lowing will be called the MBas basis set. Additionally
the correction on the basis set extension was consid-
ered within the Dirac-Coulomb approximation using the
CCSDT method. The extended basis set, LBas, included
61s-, 50p-, 33d-, 6f - and 4g- type functions. Finally,
also the truncated version of the MBas basis set, SBas,
was used which includes 25s, 15p and 2d functions. The
Gauss ﬁnite nuclear model was used in all of the calcula-
tions. All (ﬁve) electrons of the considered system were
included in all the correlation calculations discussed in
the next section.

For the Dirac-Fock-Gaunt calculations and Coulomb
integral transformations we used the dirac15 code
[45]. Relativistic correlation calculations were performed
within the mrcc code [46–48]. One-electron bispinors
were obtained within the D∞h point group while cor-
relation calculations were performed employing the D2h
symmetry [49]. This suggests possible extensions of these
kind of calculations on molecules.

The code to compute matrix elements of the Breit op-
erator (4) over one-electron bispinors generated by the
dirac15 code has been developed in the present paper.
The following algorithm is used. At ﬁrst Coulomb-type
integrals over primitive Gaussian-type basis functions,
xlymzn · e−αir
are computed. Then one uses four-index

2

transformation to obtain integrals of the Breit operator
(4) over one-electron bispinors. We use a standard tech-
nique to reduce the formal complexity of this step from
O(N 8) to O(N 5) where N is the number of basis func-
tions. No symmetry is used in the algorithm to be able
to use this code in further molecular applications.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table I gives a positive energy contribution to g fac-
tor of the ground 2P1/2 and excited 2P3/2 states of Ar13+
via diﬀerent methods within the Breit approximation. In
this study the Dirac-Fock-Gaunt method (without the re-
tardation part of the Breit interaction) for the open-shell
2P1/2 state of Ar13+ has been used to obtain one-electron
bispinors for subsequent correlation calculation. In this
procedure negative and positive one-electron functions
were updated at each iteration of the Dirac-Fock-Gaunt
procedure [50]. Correlation calculations were performed
within the Breit approximation – the retardation part
was added to the Hamiltonian after the self-consistent
stage. MP2(S) (MP2 is the second-order MøllerPlesset
perturbation theory) is the ﬁrst order in the interelec-
tron interaction (with respect to chosen zero-order ap-
proximation) contribution to g factor.
It can be seen
from Table I that higher-order correlation eﬀects within
the nondegenerate PT [MP2(SD)] or terms of single-
reference CC models also contribute; however, their sum
gives a rather small contribution for the problem under
consideration [compare the results of the CCSDTQ and
MP2(S) approaches]. This can be an indication of slight
static correlation eﬀects whose description is of some dif-
ﬁculty for the single-reference CC approaches (e.g., there
is some admixture of the 1s22p3 conﬁguration to the lead-
ing 1s22s22p1 conﬁguration – the corresponding cluster
amplitude is about 0.1). The CCSD approach overesti-
mates the value of g factor for the 2P1/2 state and under-
estimates it for the case of the 2P3/2 state. Nevertheless,
one can see that the treatment of higher-order cluster am-
plitudes leads to rather fast convergence in the CC series
[CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT, CCSDT(Q) and CCSDTQ].
According to Table I, already the CCSDT method gives
results that almost coincide with the ﬁnal values for both
considered states. The values of g factor obtained within
the CCSDT(Q) and CCSDTQ are identical within six
digits.

i.e.,

The full CI

treatment of all correlation eﬀects
in the CIS-
for the positive energy spectrum,
DTQP/CCSDTQP models was possible within the SBas
basis set. As expected, the inclusion of pentuple (quintu-
ple) excitations gave negligible contribution to g factor.
Table II provides results for the g factor of the
2P1/2 state within the single-reference [47] and mul-
tireference (MR) [48] conﬁguration interaction meth-
ods. Two diﬀerent active spaces were used for the

3

multireference treatment.
In the MRmin-CI model
active space included only 2p1/2 bispinors. For ex-
for the MRmin-CISD model the variational
ample,
problem is solved in the basis of Slater determi-
nants corresponding to [(1s)2(2s)22p1
j=1/2,mj=1/2] and
[(1s)2(2s)22p1
j=1/2,mj=−1/2] conﬁgurations and all single
and double excitations from these determinants to all
virtual orbitals.
In the MRsp-CI model the complete
active space (CAS) included all 2s (j = 1/2) and 2p
(j = 1/2, 3/2) bispinors, i.e. determinants with all pos-
sible distributions of three electrons over these bispinors
were considered as the multireference. For example, in
the MRsp-CISDT one considers all possible single, double
and triple excitations from these determinants (includ-
ing excitations from 1s2). As can be seen in the present
case of ﬁve correlated electrons the g-factor value con-
verges very fast for both considered multireference mod-
els. Note, that the convergence of the correlation energy
is slower. The single-reference series (CISD, CISDT, CIS-
DTQ, FCI) converges much slower.

Table III presents the ﬁnal value of g factor including
the negative energy spectrum contribution which was cal-
culated in the ﬁrst order of the interelectronic interaction
[within the MP2(S) method]. For the positive energy
spectrum the CCSDTQ result was taken as the most
accurate one (it included 1.3×108 cluster amplitudes).
We also took into account basis set correction calculated
within the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian employing the
CCSDT method [43]. This correction is included in the
uncertainty of the ﬁnal value.

QED contribution to the g factors of the considered
2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states has been estimated at the same
level as g factor using the operator given by Eq. (3)
which has also been employed in Refs. [24, 25]. The
obtained contribution is termed “QED estimation” in
Table III. Within the rigorous QED theory in the ﬁrst
order in α the one-electron QED correction is given
by the self-energy and vacuum-polarization diagrams.
The self-energy contribution was evaluated to all or-
ders in the parameter αZ in eﬀective screening potential
in Ref. [23] (see also Ref. [51] for high-accuracy calcu-
lations in the Coulomb potential and Ref. [52] for re-

cent extension of the screening-potential calculations to
Z =10–20). These values are presented in Table III
as “self-energy correction”. The vacuum-polarization
contribution was found to be on the level of 10−9 for
both considered states [23]. For the two-loop QED
correction (of the second order in α) only the free-
electron value (zeroth order in αZ) is available [53], it
is termed “free-electron two-loop QED” in Table III. Fi-
nally, the ﬁrst-order interelectronic-interaction contribu-
tion was evaluated with the frequency-dependent opera-
tor in Refs. [23, 52]. The diﬀerence between this value
and the corresponding term evaluated with the Coulomb
and frequency independent Breit operators is termed
“one-photon-exchange QED” in Table III. QED contri-
butions obtained by the approximation operator given by
Eq. (3) and rigorous results of Ref. [23] are compared in
Table III and found to be in reasonable agreement.
Our “Total + QED estimation” value in Table III
is obtained as a sum of the Breit-approximation result
and the QED estimation by Eq. (3). In this way, we can
consistently compare our results with those of Refs. [24,
25] where the individual contributions within the Breit
approximation were not given.

The most accurate up-to-date g-factor values should
include the rigorous results for the QED [23] and nuclear
recoil [26] corrections.

It can be seen that the correlation part of the g factor
within the Breit approximation is in perfect agreement
with the corresponding values from Ref. [23]. It should
be stressed that in the present paper a completely diﬀer-
ent approach has been used. We employed Gaussian-type
basis functions deﬁned above while the Dirac-Fock-Sturm
functions were used in [23]. In addition, in our approach
diﬀerent zero-order approximation has been used: Dirac-
Fock-Gaunt vs. one-particle Dirac in [23]. We have per-
formed additional calculations within the LBas basis set
using the one-particle Dirac equation. g-factor values
for both considered electronic states obtained within this
approach coincide within ∼ 10−10 with analytic values

given by Eqs. (3) and (4) in [23] and presented in Table
I of Ref. [23]. This also suggests an additional test of
the basis set completeness. Due to completely diﬀerent
zero-order approximations and diﬀerent practical tech-
niques used in the present correlation calculations and
in [23] it is not possible to compare some intermediate
values, such as one-photon exchange from [23], with our
correlation models and only the ﬁnal values can be com-
pared. However, as was already noted above, these ﬁnal
values obtained with diﬀerent methods to treat electron
correlation eﬀects (CC theory up to full CC vs PT+CI-
DFS) within the Breit approximations agree on the level
of 10−6 (within the numerical uncertainty). This is not
the case for the other previously obtained results [24, 25]
(see Table III).

It should be stressed that in the present paper we per-
formed benchmark full CI calculation which includes all
correlation eﬀects for the positive-energy states. It means
that this result can be used to test diﬀerent approximate
methods. Taking into account the data from Tables I and
II one should note that a delicate check of the g-factor
value is required in the case when electron correlation
eﬀects are taken into account approximately. For exam-
ple, in the case of the 2P1/2 state the simplest MP2(S)
model gives the same results as the full CI method. At
the same time the CCSD(T) method gives results which
are in poorer agreement with the full CI results.

Unfortunately,

in the previous studies only limited
data concerning the convergence of the g-factor value
with respect to inclusion of correlation eﬀects are pre-
sented or only the ﬁnal result is given. On the other hand
it was shown that the reasonable multireference conﬁgu-
ration interaction model can provide accurate results for
g factor. Taking into account the data in Table II as well
as the above discussion and according to the description
given for the multireference CI model in Ref. [24] one
may suggest that the model may give reasonable result
for the positive energy contribution to g factor. But one
should stress that there can also be some dependence on
the actual details of the implemented approach in [24].
The latter is also true for Ref. [25].

In the theory section it is noted that the contribution
of the negative energy spectrum to g factor is impor-
tant (the actual value of the contribution depends on
the method of the negative energy bispinors construc-
tion). According to the description given in Ref. [24]
the Breit interaction was added to the Hamiltonian after
the multiconﬁgurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculation
which was performed within the Dirac-Coulomb Hamil-
tonian. No inﬂuence of the Breit interaction on the neg-
ative energy states was considered at this stage. Within
the updated Hamiltonian the conﬁguration interaction
calculation has been performed including only positive-
energy states. In such approach important contribution
of the simultaneous treatment of the Breit [Eq. (4)] and
Zeeman [Eq. (2)] interactions is not taken into account.

CONCLUSION

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The correlation treatment of g factors of the ground
and excited states of the B-like Ar ion within the Dirac-
Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian has been performed. Uncer-
tainty of the result has been tested by performing the full
CI calculation (i.e.
full inclusion of correlation eﬀects)
and considering diﬀerent basis sets. Obtained g factors
of the ground 2P1/2 and excited 2P3/2 states coincide
within the uncertainty with one of three previous the-
oretical results [23] and thus can be considered as its
independent conﬁrmation.
It is shown that high-order
correlation eﬀects give non-negligible individual contri-
butions to the value of g factor; however, their sum is
small for the problem under consideration.

In this work, the code to compute matrix elements of
the Breit interaction has been developed. It does not use
atomic symmetry and can be modiﬁed to study heavy
atoms in external ﬁelds and molecules which is already of
great interest for precise study of electron electric dipole
moment enhancement factors [28–30], hyperﬁne struc-
ture and related fundamental problems including few-
