Abstract 

In the current study, a quantum-cascade-laser-based dual-comb spectrometer (DCS) was 
used to paint a detailed picture of a 1.0 ms high-temperature reaction between propyne and 
oxygen. The DCS interfaced with a shock tube to provide pre-ignition conditions of 1225 
K, 2.8 atm, and 2% p-C3H4/18% O2/Ar. The spectrometer consisted of two free-running, 
non-stabilized frequency combs each emitting at 179 wavelengths between 1174 and 1233 
cm-1
. A free spectral range, 𝑓𝑟, of  9.86 GHz and a difference in comb spacing, Δ𝑓𝑟, of 5 
MHz, enabled a theoretical time resolution of 0.2 µs but the data was time-integrated to 4 
µs  to  improve  SNR.  The  accuracy  of  the  spectrometer  was  monitored  using  a  suite  of 
independent laser diagnostics and good agreement observed. Key challenges remain in the 
fitting  of  available  high-temperature  spectroscopic  models  to  the  observed  spectra  of  a 
post-ignition environment.

1.  Introduction  

For 

such 

environments, 

Energy  systems  involving  high  temperatures  and  fast 
reactions  rely  on  absorption  spectroscopy  for  fundamental 
research  and  field  diagnostics.  However,  measurements  at 
extreme  conditions  are  fundamentally  challenging  due  to 
short  timescales  and  complex  thermochemistry  that  is  often 
high-bandwidth 
present. 
measurement of a spectral surface (absorbance as a function 
of  wavenumber  and 
time)  could  provide  sufficient 
information  for  speciation,  thermometry,  and  knowledge  of 
quantum state populations in non-equilibrium environments. 
However, many broadband measurement techniques, such as 
Fourier  Transform  Infrared  spectrometers  or  rapid-tuning 
broad-scan  external  cavity  quantum  cascade  lasers  [1],  are 
mechanically  limited  to  low  time-resolutions.  Advanced 
broadband  diagnostics  being  developed  without  such 
mechanical 
super-continuum  and 
involve 
frequency-comb absorption spectroscopy [2–9]. 

limitations 

Two frequency combs can be combined to help interpret 
the  signal  of  multiple  wavelengths  simultaneously,  a 
technique  called  dual-comb  spectroscopy  (DCS).    Notable 
studies  involving  DCS  include:  the  first  dual-comb  field 
diagnostic monitoring greenhouse gases [2], dual-combs in a 
rapid  compression  machine  [8],  and  DCS  used  to  study 
protein dynamics [10]. 

It  is  of  great  interest  to  apply  DCS  to  study  high-
temperature reaction kinetics. However, this application puts 
stringent constraints on a spectrometer’s capabilities. At high-
temperatures, reactions occur over short timescales and often 
in  vessels  with  short  path  lengths.  Correspondingly,  it  is 
important  to  have  microsecond  time-resolution  and  a  high 
power  across  all  wavelengths  (power-per-wavelength)  to 
ensure  sufficient  signal  to  noise  in  a  dynamic  environment 
with emission and vibration. Furthermore, it is desirable for 
measurements to be made in the  mid-infrared between 3-20 
µm  with  access  to  the  prominent  absorption  features  of 
hydrocarbons, such as CH2 and CH3 stretching modes in the 
3 µm region, –CH=CH2 bending  modes near 11 µm, or CH 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
bending modes near 15 µm [11]. To the authors’ knowledge, 
reaction  kinetics  using  frequency-comb  spectroscopy  was 
first  studied  by  Fleisher  et  al.  &  Bjork  et  al.  involving 
measurements of a photolysis-induced reaction at 25 µs time 
resolution [12,13]. These studies did not use DCS but used a 
single frequency comb and diffraction grating to interpret the 
signal.  The  use  of  two  frequency  combs,  dual-comb 
spectroscopy,  has  been  applied  to  high-temperature,  non-
reacting conditions in a rapid compression machine by Draper 
et al. at 704 µs time-resolution and also by Schroeder et al. in 
the exhaust of a gas turbine at high temperatures and 10-60 s  
time-resolution  [4,8].  Draper  et  al.  and  Schroeder  et  al. 
achieved  exceptional  spectral  resolution  with 
tens  of 
thousands of wavelengths in the near-IR. A worthy extension 
of  the  work  of  Draper  and  Schroeder  et  al.  would  be  to 
establish  similar  techniques  in  the  mid-IR  with  improved 
time-resolution.  

Efforts  to  extend  DCS  into  the  3-20  µm  region  have 
involved  distributed  feedback  generation  DFG  [14],  optical 
parametric oscillators (OPO) [15–17], and quantum-cascade-
laser  (QCL)  approaches  [6,7,18–20].  Obtaining  coherency 
between two frequency combs is an enabling factor for DCS 
and DFG approaches can achieve this readily. However, DFG 
methods generally have limited power-per-wavelength, which 
limits application in many environments [19]. Alternatively, 
OPO-based combs can obtain a higher power-per-wavelength 
while also providing access to the mid-infrared. However, a 
disadvantage of OPO combs involves the fact that coherency 
between  separate  combs  is  more  challenging  to  obtain.  For 
this reason, dispersion was used when Fleisher et al. and Bjork 
et al. first studied reaction kinetics with a mid-infrared OPO 
comb [12,13]. An extension of the work of Fleisher and Bjork 
et  al.  would  involve  the  use  of  two  coherent,  mid-IR 
frequency combs configured as a dual-comb spectrometer.   

Prominently,  a  class  of  OPO  combs  operating  in 
degeneracy,  known  also  as  divide-by-two  subharmonic 
OPOs, have  successfully  demonstrated coherency and  dual-
comb  operation  [17,21,22].  The  OPO-based  DCS  of 
Muraviev  et  al.  [17]  offered  remarkable  spectral  coverage 
(3.1-5.5 µm with 350,000 spectral data points), although with 
a  minimum time-resolution of only 7 ms. While only a matter 
of time, OPO-based DCS has  yet to demonstrate both dual-
comb and microsecond operation in the mid-infrared. 

Advances  in  the  field  of  quantum-cascade-laser  (QCL) 
frequency  combs  have  led  to  the  development  of  mid-IR, 
solid-state  spectrometers  that  have  attracted  considerable 
attention in the recent literature [7,10,20,23–25]. In particular, 
the  recent  advent  of  QCL  frequency  combs  provides  an 
alternative to DFG and OPO combs when a high power-per-
wavelength and fast time resolution are needed [20,25]. QCL 
combs can offer over 1 mW per wavelength and microsecond 
time-resolution,  with  the  tradeoff  of  having  a  larger  comb 
spacing  (~0.3  cm-1)  and  less  spectral  range  than  alternative 
systems. To date, these QCL-based systems have performed 
well  in  proof-of-concept  demonstrations,  e.g.  to  observe 
protein dynamics [10,20]. 

In this study, we demonstrate a mid-infrared QCL-based 
dual-comb  spectrometer  (DCS)  capable  of  microsecond-
resolved  measurements  of  energetic  gas  phase  reactions. 
Specifically,  an  aggressive  chemical  reaction,  propyne 
oxidation,  was  studied  using  a  pressure-driven  shock  tube 
equipped  with  two  QCL  frequency  combs  and  a  suite  of 
independent  validation  diagnostics.  This  study  details  the 
dual-comb spectrometer employed, provides a demonstrative 
propyne  oxidation  measurement,  and  concludes  with  an 
assessment of system accuracy. 

2.  Background 

2.1. Laser systems 

An overview of the experimental setup is provided in Fig. 1, 
illustrating the placement of frequency combs and other validation 
diagnostics on a shock tube with a bore of 14.13 cm. The shock tube 
was  used  to  generate  the  high-temperature  conditions  and  was 
described by Strand et al. [1] previously. The shock tube interfaced 
with  a  dual-comb  (QCL-based)  spectrometer,  and  two  additional 
interband cascade lasers (ICL) to study water and propyne. A side-
wall  pressure  transducer  was  also  used  to  monitor  the  pressure 
during the reaction.  

Fig. 1. An illustration of a shock tube equipped with a QCL dual-
comb spectrometer and supporting validation diagnostics. HgCdTe 
(MCT)  detectors,  interband  cascade  lasers  (ICLs),  pressure 
transducer, and a reaction zone are indicated. 

2.1.1.  Dual-comb spectrometer 

The DCS developed for the current study relies on two 
free-running  QCL-based  frequency  combs  (from  IRsweep 
AG), each spanning about 60 cm-1. The native emission power 
of each comb  was >500 mW resulting in >2 mW per comb 
tooth on average. Each QCL comb was slightly detuned from 
another to yield two different repetition frequencies, f1 and f2 
that  were  both  at  approximately  0.3  cm-1 or  9.86  GHz.  The 
difference  in  repetition  rates,  ∆frep  =  f1  -  f2,  was  typically 
around 5 MHz. This slight difference resulted in the creation 
of a set of beating frequencies between each detuned pair of 
spectral lines. This set of beat-notes constitutes an additional 
frequency comb in the radio-frequency (RF) domain. Unlike 
the mid-infrared combs that generated the beat-notes, this RF 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comb is at much slower frequencies and its intensity vs. time 
can be measured on a detector.  

The  combs  emitted  at  179  different  wavelengths  from 
1174  to  1233  cm-1  providing  access  to  high-temperature 
absorption  features  for  alkynes  and  water  in  this  region 
[26,27].  FTIR  measurements  of  the  corresponding  emission 
from each comb are presented in Fig. 2. The narrow emission 
of each comb tooth is below the 0.3 cm-1
 spectral resolution of 
the  FTIR  and  this  under-sampling  manifests  itself  as  the 
broadened  peaks  seen  in  Fig  2.  However,  the  FTIR 
measurements in Fig. 2 very effectively illustrate the emission 
range  of the  QCL’s and  the  spectral power distribution that 
can be expected from the spectrometer.  

Fig.  2.  FTIR  measurements  of  each  frequency  comb.  While 
emission of each comb line is well below the spectral resolution of 
the  FTIR  (0.3  cm-1),  these  FTIR  measurements  provide  a  clear 
picture  of  the  wavenumber-dependent  power  distribution  of  the 
system  with  high  power  near  1185  cm-1  and  1220  cm-1  and  low 
power near 1205 cm-1

heterodyne signal and provides insights about the QCL combs 
that  generated  the  pattern.  Prominently,  the  RF  frequency 
comb in Fig. 4 has a similar shape as the power profiles from 
the FTIR measurements presented in Fig. 2.

periods (left) and for a single period (shown right) with a shared 
ordinate axis. Good signal is observed for each period and SNR is 
improved further through time-integration to 4 µs.  

The  power  in  each  RF  beat-note  is  proportional  to  the 
product  of  the  electric  fields  of  the  two  contributing  laser 
modes.  Consequently,  changes  to  the  intensities  of  the 
measured beat-notes directly correlates to attenuation of light 
in the optical domain. To calculate absorbance using the DCS 
system,  the  attenuation  at  each  optical  wavelength  was 
calculated,  adjusted  by  a  pre-experimental  background 
measurement, and normalized by an unattenuated signal. The 
absorbance  of  the  mixture  at  each  wavelength  was  then 
determined using the Beer-Lambert relation.  

light  from 

The emission from the pair of QCL combs was coaligned 
and split to yield two combined beams. The first (reference) 
beam  was attenuated and focused onto a reference  HgCdTe 
(MCT)  detector,  while  the  second  (sample)  beam  was 
attenuated  and  transmitted  through  wedged,  anti-reflection-
coated ZnSe windows in the shock tube. After traversing the 
shock tube, this beam was directed through a long-pass filter 
and  focused  on  another  MCT  detector.  The  superimposed 
wavelengths  of 
two  frequency  combs 
heterodyned on each detector and generated a comb in the RF 
domain spaced at ∆frep. The detectors had a bandwidth of 1 
GHz  and  were  digitally  sampled  at  2.0  GS/s  to  record  a 
sequence of interferograms spaced at a period of 1/∆frep (0.2 
µs).  The  shortest  achievable 
this 
configuration  is  determined  by  the  period  of  a  single 
interferogram  and  was  therefore  0.2  µs.  However,  the 
interferograms were then averaged over a time-interval of 4 
µs  to  improve  signal-to-noise  ratio.  In  the  time  domain,  a 
representative signal from the DCS is shown in Fig. 3, which 
demonstrates a typical interferogram pattern observed.

Figure 4 presents the result of a Fourier transformation of 
the  time-domain data to  assess the frequency content of the 
DCS  signal.  As  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  4,  the  slight  detuning 
between  the  two  frequency  combs  manifests  itself  as  an 
additional frequency comb in the RF domain. The beating, or 
heterodyning,  between  DCS  comb  teeth  creates  the  multi-
heterodyne pattern in Fig. 4. The discrete and equally spaced 
peaks confirm that the system is generating a successful multi-

comb system generated by taking the Fourier transformer of time-
domain data.  The sharp set of beat-notes presented here indicates 
effective detuning and operation of the of two QCL combs.  

Notably,  the  spectral  separation  of  the  superimposed 
laser lines contributing to an individual beat-note varied from 
50  to  900  MHz;  however,  an  average  frequency  for  each 
superimposed  pair  of  comb  teeth  was  used  for  absorbance. 
Accordingly, the optical resolution of each emission line was 
limited  to  900  MHz  (0.03  cm-1),  and  overall  spectroscopic 
sampling resolution governed by the comb spacing of 0.3 cm-
1. To ensure quality measurements, the system was calibrated 
before  and  after  each  experiment  against  the  well-known 
spectrum  of  polyethylene.  Ultimately,  while  no  active 
wavelength stabilization method was used during an  
experiment,  a  comparison  of  the  pre-  and  post-shock 
calibration indicated drift of < 100 kHz.

of the incident and reflected shock before time-zero. The broadband absorption feature of propyne is visible from 0 to 0.6 ms and 
can be seen transforming into a finely featured spectrum (water) after 0.8 ms. The DCS data demonstrates good SNR during the 
passage of each shock wave, occurrence of a combustion reaction, and temperature/pressure increase of roughly 2500 K/60x over 
only 1 ms. 

2.1.2.  Supporting laser diagnostics 

In  addition  to  the  DCS,  two  separate  laser  diagnostic 
systems, shown in Fig. 1, were employed simultaneously to 
monitor  the  reaction.  A  scanned-wavelength  diagnostic  for 
water  was  used  to  measure  a  water  absorption  transition  at 
4029.5 cm-1 using a wavelength-tuned interband cascade laser 
(ICL) with a scan repetition rate of 5 kHz [28,29].  Secondly, 
a fixed-wavelength laser diagnostic for propyne detection was 
used at 2999.55 cm-1 using an additional ICL. Each ICL was 
coupled  with  a  HgCdTe (MCT) detector that was sampled at 5 
MHz.  

2.2.  Propyne Oxidation  

Propyne oxidation was selected as the reaction of interest 
due to a blended broadband absorption feature of propyne and 
wealth  of  narrow  absorption  transitions  of  water  between 
1174 -1233 cm-1. The absorption feature of propyne is derived 
from the P-branch of the second harmonic of propyne’s –CH 
in-plane  vibrational  bending  mode 
[11,26].  At  high 
temperatures,  nearly  the  entire  P-branch  of  the  propyne 
absorption  feature  is  accessible  using  the  DCS  system.  The 
absorption features of water are derived from the P-branch of 
an  in-plane symmetric bending mode [11]. During oxidation, 
the  mixture’s  spectrum  evolved  in  time  as  the  broadband 
spectrum  of  propyne  transformed  into  the  finely  featured 
spectrum of water. 

3.  Experimental Results 

3.1.  Overview 

Data from all diagnostics are presented in Fig. 5-7 for an 
example  shock 
tube  experiment.  The  pressure-driven, 
stainless  steel  shock  tube  shown  in  Fig.  1  was  used  to 
propagate a shock wave at Mach 2.2 into a test gas mixture 
with an initial molar composition of 2% p-C3H4/18% O2/80% 
Ar, a temperature of 298 K, and a pressure of 75 Torr.  Figure  5 
presents a sample of the DCS data from this reaction where 
the broadband propyne absorption feature can be seen at early 
times and the finely featured spectrum of water observed after 
0.75  ms.  The  full  dataset  of 
the  DCS  absorbance 
measurements is presented in Fig. 6(b). The lowest pressure 
and  absorbance  measurements  in  Fig.  5  and  Fig.  6(a-b), 
located before -75 µs, indicate this pre-shock region. Upon the 
arrival  of  the  first  shock  wave,  there  is  a  step  change  in 
pressure and absorbance of the test gas, seen in Fig. 5 and Fig. 
6(a-b) at -75 µs, as the mixture is heated and pressurized to 
720  K  and  0.7  atm.  At  this  time,  the  tail  of  the  propyne 
absorption  feature  first  appears  in  Fig.  5  and  Fig.  6(b)  near 
1225-1230 cm-1 and the apex of the feature rests just beyond 
the domain limit of 1233 cm-1.   

After  75  µs,  the  reflected  shock  wave  arrives  (defining 
time-zero)  and  provides  another  pressure  increase  that  is 
visible in Fig. 6(a). At time-zero, chemistry is assumed to be 
momentarily  frozen  and  the  mixture  condition  changed  to 
1225 K and 2.8 atm. Also at time-zero, the system undergoes 
a rapid redistribution of the state populations, which shifts the 
crest of the propyne feature seen in Fig. 6(b) to approximately 
1220 cm-1. Soon after, oxidative pyrolysis begins and propyne 
is slowly consumed for the subsequent 0.75 ms.  During the 
pyrolysis  process,  propyne  was  observed  on  the  separate 
propyne-specific  diagnostic  and  showed  agreement  to  the 
overall decomposition rate registered by the DCS, shown on 
the left of Fig. 7.

Eq. 1 

The  diagonal  of  the  weighting  matrix  was  set  as  the 
wavenumber-  and  time-dependent  SNR  of  the  DCS  system 
(see  Fig.  A.1).  The  SNR  of  each  DCS  wavenumber  was 
defined  as  the  absorbance  at  a  given  time  divided  by  a 
measurement of the standard deviation at each wavenumber. 
The  standard  deviation  at  each  DCS  wavenumber  was 
calculated from a statistical analysis of the DCS noise, which 
was  determined  by  measuring  the  absorbance  of  a  non-
absorbing medium. Propyne and water were the only species 
included in the cross-section matrix, K. Expected intermediate 
species that form in trace amounts, but potentially detectable 
quantities, include: allene, acetylene, methane, ethylene, and 
formaldehyde.  Of  these  potentially  interfering  species,  only 
methane  and  acetylene  absorb  in  this  region,  although 
acetylene absorbs very weakly.  

These 

environments[30]. 

Temperature-dependent  absorption  cross-sections  were 
determined  for  propyne  through  a  series  of  additional  non-
oxidative 2% p-C3H4/98% Ar experiments ranging from 1100 
to 1400 K. Water cross-sections were collected from a series 
of fuel-lean hydrogen oxidation experiments (2-4%H2/2-4% 
O2  at  1670-2030  K)  and  methane-oxidation  experiments 
(4.5% CH4/9% O2/Ar near 2900 K) to generate  water in the 
independent 
post-ignition 
experiments provided the absorption cross-sections that were 
not  available  through  existing  experimental  or  theoretical 
databases.  Cross-section  correlations  across  all  179 
wavelengths  were  assumed  to  have  a  linear  temperature 
cross-section 
dependence.  Acetylene 
measurements  were  also  collected  due  to  their  potential  to 
absorb  and  interfere  in  this  spectral  region.  From  the 
additional  cross-section  measurements,  acetylene  was 
undetectable, but methane’s cross-section was non-negligible. 
Equation 1 was solved both with and without methane in order 
to  assess  whether  it  was  detectable  as  an  intermediate. 
Including methane in the absorption cross-section matrix did 
not  yield statistically  significant  methane  measurements but 
did contribute approximately 5% additional uncertainty to the 
propyne mole fraction measurements between 0.5 and 1 ms. 
This  additional  uncertainty  was  accounted  for  in  the  95% 
confidence interval included with the data in Fig. 7.

After  a  residence  time  of  approximately  0.75-0.9  ms, 
exponential  growth  of  the  radical  pool  takes  hold  and  the 
mixture  ignites.  Formation  of  water  during  ignition  was 
observed by both the DCS and the scanned-wavelength water 
diagnostic. In Fig. 6(b), water formation is represented by a 
brush  of  fine  absorption  lines  just  before  0.9  ms.  These 
absorption  features  arise  coincident  with  H2O  formation 
observed using the ancillary water diagnostic, which is shown 
on the right of Fig. 7.

3.2.  Speciation 

Quantitative  speciation  measurements  were  performed 
using  the  DCS  and  the  supporting  laser  diagnostics  and 
compared to a kinetic model (USC Mech II [30]), all shown 
in Fig. 7. For DCS measurement of propyne and water mole 
fractions, a vectorized Beer-Lambert system was formulated 
as  presented  in  Eq.  1.  The  system  included:  W  a  weighting 
parameter matrix, K a cross-section matrix (cm-1 atm-1), 𝒙 a 
mole  fraction  vector,  and  𝒃  (cm-1  atm-1)  a  vector  of  the 
pressure-  and  path-length-normalized  absorbance  at  each 
DCS wavelength as a function of time. The formulation of the

Speciation measurements at a 95% confidence interval and simulated results for propyne and water. All simulations used the 
USC  Mech  II  kinetic  mechanism  and  assumed  constant  volume  [30].  Agreement  at  a  95%  confidence  interval  is  observed 
between the DCS and supporting laser measurements. While overall agreement exists between the DCS measurements and USC 
Mech II, key differences are visible at early times and just after ignition.

contribution to the final mole fraction solution, however, with 
the  specific  contribution  commensurate  to  the  wavelength’s

the mole fractions of propyne and water were found to be in 
fair agreement with the validation diagnostics and USC Mech. 
II (see Fig. 7), with fluctuations in the mole fraction of water 
roughly correlating to the pressure shown in Fig. 6(a). In the 
DCS-based mole fraction measurements at early times (0 to 
0.2  ms),  we  observe  a  convex  decay  profile  that  appears 
higher and at odds to the concave predictions of the model and 
ancillary propyne diagnostic. This difference after time-zero 
is still being investigated as to the source.  

3.3.  Uncertainty quantification 

Uncertainty  was  propagated  for  the  DCS  and  the 
supporting  laser  diagnostics  to  assess  whether  the  results 
agree within a 95 % confidence interval.  All uncertainties are 
included  with  each  measurement  in  Fig.  7.  The  single-
wavelength  propyne  diagnostic  uncertainty  is  presented  in 
light  gray  bars  at  0.35  ms  and  0.68  ms,  the  scanned-
wavelength water diagnostic uncertainty as light blue bars at 
0.7 ms, 1 ms, and 1.4 ms, and the DCS propyne (black) and 
DCS  water (dark  blue)  uncertainty  visible at  all other times 
where ± bars are indicated. 

DCS  uncertainty  was  largely  governed  by  the  high-
temperature absorption cross-section measurements used for 
speciation.  These  measurements  were  collected  through  the 
the  water-
non-oxygenated  propyne  experiments  and 

cross-section 

generating  experiments  described  previously.  Linear 
temperature-dependent 
correlations  were 
determined  at each of the 179 wavelengths  along  with  each 
correlation’s  uncertainty  to  a  95%  confidence  interval. 
Equation  2  was  used  to  compute  the  cross-section  (𝜎) 
uncertainty  at  wavelength  𝜆  (𝑢𝜆,𝜎,95%)  and  involved:  the 
residual  squared  error  for  the  linear  fit  at  wavelength  𝜆 
(𝑅𝑆𝑆𝜆),  sample  number  (n),  and  the  temperature  for  each 
cross-section measurement (𝑇𝑖). This method for uncertainty 
propagation  was  described  previously  in  [31]  and  derived 
from[32].

Uncertainty  associated  with  the  pressure-  and  path-

(𝑢𝑏)  was  estimated  by 
propagating error due to path length, pressure, and attenuated

dominant  contributor.  Equation  3  was  then  used  in  the

the final spectrum of water can be made out from the last two 
frames of Fig. 8 (a-b). We conclude that the 4 µs resolution 
data are of sufficient quality to make out the spectrum and its 
evolution.  Although  noise  increases  with  shorter  time 
resolution, and there are regions with very low SNR, this data 
demonstrates  the  opportunity  to  DCS  to  effectively  capture 
reaction kinetics.

fraction  of  species  𝑥𝑖  with  respect  to  the  cross-section 
correlation,  𝜎,  and  pressure-  and  path-length-normalized 
absorbance,  b.  Notably,  the  uncertainties  in  the  final 
measurements  were  calculated  assuming 
the  potential 
presence  of  methane.  In  these  calculations,  methane  was 
added  to  the  matrix  K  from  Eq.  1  to  assess  how  the 
measurements could be affected with a third absorber present. 
The propyne and water species time-histories were unaffected 
by  this  addition,  however,  their  corresponding  uncertainties 
were affected. The largest influence was to the propyne mole 
fraction uncertainty, which increased by about 5 % in the 0.2 
ms  proceeding  ignition.  No  statistically  significant  methane 
was  observed  to  form  and  therefore  the  results  with  no 
methane are shown in Fig. 7 but with the larger uncertainties 
included.    Future  studies  may  also  consider  numerically 
perturbing the temperature profile used in the determination 
of  the  temperature-dependent  cross-sections.  However,  the 
uncertainty here was largely dominated by the uncertainty in 
the 
the  absorption  cross-section  measurements  and 
absorbance.  Therefore,  adding  these  additional  terms  will 
yield  only  minor  contributions  to  the  overall  uncertainty 
reported.  

This method of uncertainty propagation was also used for 
the  fixed-wavelength  propyne  diagnostic  presented  as  light 
gray  in  Fig.  7.  This  diagnostic  used  only  one  wavelength, 
rather than 179 for the DCS. Correspondingly, the uncertainty 
is much larger for the single-wavelength diagnostic due to a 

𝜕𝑥𝑖
𝜕𝑏

very  large  sensitivity  from  the  term  (
). This  observation 
confirms the utility of using multiple wavelengths as a means 
of  decreasing  this  sensitivity  and,  therefore,  the  overall 
uncertainty in mole fraction measurements. In contrast, for the 
DCS diagnostic, improvements in the reference cross-sections 
will yield a largest reduction in uncertainty.  

Uncertainties  associated  to  the  scanned-wavelength 
measurements were determined using the RSS of the Voigt fit 
to the absorbance trace recorded and detailed in the literature 
[29].  

In consideration of the uncertainties presented, the DCS 
and supporting diagnostic measurements of both propyne and 
water  agree  within  a  95  %  confidence  interval.  However, 
before  0.1  ms  and  immediately  after  ignition  a  subtle  but 
observable  disagreement  exists  between  the  DCS  and  the 
supporting diagnostics that is still under investigation.

measurement at 100 µs and 4 µs time resolution, respectively,

Low SNR regions between 1200-1210 cm-1 and beyond 1230 
cm-1 exhibit high noise yet contain valuable data even at 4 µs 
time resolution. The blended-spectrum of the P-branch of the 
propyne can be seen very clearly at early times for both 100

4.3. Spectral accuracy  

Spectral  accuracy  of  the  spectrometer  was  tested  both 
using  an  independent  laser  diagnostic  for  propyne  and  two 
available  high-temperature  spectroscopic  models  for  water. 
The  spectrum  of  high-temperature  propyne  showed  good 
agreement to independent spectral measurements, confirming 
the spectral accuracy of the system. However, an interesting 
disagreement was found between the measured spectrum and 
available  spectroscopic  models  for  high-temperature  water 
[27,33].  At  this  time,  no  high-temperature  models  exist  for 
propyne that can be used for comparison.  

4.3.1.  Independent spectral measurements | propyne 

A rapidly-tunable external-cavity QCL was used to scan 
over the same portion of the spectral region as the DCS. A full 
description of the scanned QCL laser methodology is provided in the 
literature [1]. Non-oxygenated mixtures of 2% p-C3H4/Ar were 
used  to  compare  each  diagnostic.  Experiments  using  the 
scanned-QCL were limited to temperatures below 1130 K, where 
propyne was thermally stable for the 2 ms scan time.  A common 
condition of  1120 K and 3 atm  was tested for both systems 
and the results are shown in Fig. 9. The DCS measurement in 
Fig. 9 was time-averaged over the same 2 ms as the scan from 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  scanned-QCL.    Good  agreement  is  visible  between  the 
DCS and the QCL spectra with the only discrepancies in the 
two measurements corresponding to low SNR regions of the 
DCS. The scanned-QCL’s spectral resolution is limited to 0.3 
cm-1, roughly equal to the DCS point spacing. Accordingly, 
the scanned-QCL was only used on the broadband spectrum 
of propyne and spectroscopic models used to investigate the 
spectrum of water.  

reduced  uncertainty  in  speciation  and  to  potentially  enable 
thermometry.  However,  across  several  species  that  absorb  in  the 
region  (propyne,  methane,  and  water),  there  is  a  lack  of  high-
temperature spectroscopic data to compare to, or to found models 
upon, in the 1200 cm-1 region. Many studies have begun to address 
this  absence  of  data  already[1,26,35,37–43].    This  discrepancy 
suggests an opportunity for future research as measurements push to 
shorter timescales and higher temperatures, expanding the utility of 
models and DCS for use in high-temperature reaction kinetics.

C3H4/Ar near 1120 K and 3 atm measured using two-independent 
diagnostics:  a  scanned  QCL  laser  (gray)  [1]  and  the  QCL  DCS 
system  (blue).  SNR  is  shown  on  right  axis  (green)  and  was 
calculated using the DCS signal (blue) and standard deviation.  Good 
agreement  is  visible  with  discrepancies  correlated  to  low  SNR 
regions. 

4.3.2.  Spectral modeling | water 

Additional  measurements  were  taken  to  study  the 
spectrum  of  water  and  compare  against  available  high-
temperature  spectroscopic  models.  Hydrogen  oxidation 
experiments  were used to  generate a post-ignition condition 
of 4% H2O, T=1700-1800 K, P = 3-4 atm, which was studied using 
the  DCS.  Hydrogen  oxidation  provided  a  controlled  method  to 
produce water that could be measured using the DCS and compared 
to  two  spectroscopic  models:  the  HITEMP  model  and  a  recent 
model put forth by Polyansky et al. and part of the ExoMol database 
[34,35]. Publically available fortran scripts, ExoCross, were used to 
execute the ExoMol model in this study [36]. Conditions used for 
the spectroscopic  simulation relied on  modeled predictions of the 
post-ignition  temperature  using  USC  Mech  II,  the  water  mole 
fraction measured by the supporting water diagnostic, and pressure 
measured  using  a  side-wall  transducer.  A  resulting  comparison 
between the DCS measurement and HITEMP modeled spectrum of 
high-temperature  water  is  provided  in  Fig.  10.  The  DCS 
measurements use the post-ignition spectrum of hydrogen oxidation 
averaged from 400-600 μs. It is evident that the measured spectrum 
under-samples the predicted spectrum and there is poor agreement 
between  the  measured  and  simulated  spectra.  Even  when 
considering  the  under-sampling  rate,  the  difference  between  the 
modeled and measured spectrum cannot be reconciled at this time.  
It  is  of  great  interest  to  the  authors  to  fit  high-temperature 
spectroscopic models to spectra measured using the DCS. This is in 
contrast to the method employed in the current study that involved 
the use a library of measured spectra and absorption cross-sections 
for speciation. While also very effective, an improved methodology 
would rely upon fitting spectroscopic models to the DCS data for 

Fig.  10.  A  comparison  of  the  measured  and  modeled  high-
temperature spectrum of 4% H2O, T=1738 K, P = 3.14 atm that 
resulted following hydrogen oxidation, with a path length of 14.13 
cm  [27,33,36].  No  visible  agreement  is  observed  between  the 
measured  and  modeled  spectra  at  this  time.  This  observation 
identifies  an  opportunity  to  explore  an  understudied  high-
temperature band for water while also better assessing the ability for 
QCL-based dual combs to study very finely featured spectra. 

5.  Conclusion  

A  clear  tradeoff  exists  in  molecular  DCS  between 
spectral  and  time  resolution,  with  the  former  investigated 
thoroughly. Despite the fewer comb teeth used in this study, 
the mid-infrared dual-comb system demonstrated was capable 
of  resolving  propyne  oxidation  kinetics  at  4  µs  time 
resolution.  The  time  resolution  and  quality  of  the  multi-
heterodyne  signal  showed  merit  in  the  high-enthalpy  test 
environment  despite  having  several  regions  with  low  SNR. 
The DCS  was validated against a suite of independent laser 
diagnostics  with 
agreement 
demonstrated  between  laser  systems.  The  current  study 
presented  speciation  of  propyne  and  water  by  comparing  a 
measured  absorption  surface  to  a  library  of  experimentally 
measured,  high-temperature 
cross-sections. 
Agreement  was  also  observed  between  the  modeled  and 
measured  mole  fractions  of  propyne  and  water,  although 
slight  discrepancies  did  exist  at  early  times  and  just  after 
ignition, a phenomenon warranting further investigation.

While agreement was obtained between this DCS and a 
supporting  laser  diagnostic  to  measure  the  broadband 
spectrum of propyne, a notable disagreement exists between 
our measured spectra of water and existing high-temperature 
spectroscopic  models.  Therefore,  whether  QCL-based  DCS 
has  the  ability  to  measure  the  finely  featured  spectra  of 
molecules such as water, remains an open question. Towards 
this  end,  future  studies  are  needed  to  make  additional 
measurements  of  molecules  such  as  water  or  methane  with 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
finely  featured  spectra  in  this  spectral  region.  It  is  also 
important  to  make  use  of  ever-improving  high-temperature 
spectroscopic models and cross-section databases, which are 
also  still  quite  underdeveloped  at  these  temperatures  and  in 
this region.  

The  case  study  shown  here  indicates  that  a  clear 
opportunity exists for DCS to greatly increase the information 
content  of  the  traditional  laser  diagnostics  used  in  high-
enthalpy  and  reacting  test  environments.  As  mid-infrared 
dual-comb spectroscopy emerges, the study of high-enthalpy 
reacting environments offers a wide canvas of applications on 
which DCS can make a lasting impact.
