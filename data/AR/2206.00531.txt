Abstract How ﬁlaments form and erupt are topics about which solar researchers
have wondered since more than a century and that are still open to debate. We
present observations of a ﬁlament formation, its failed eruption, and the asso-
ciated ﬂare (SOL2019-05-09T05:51) that occurred in active region (AR) 12740
using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Solar-Terrestrial
Relations Observatory A (STEREO-A), the Interface Region Imaging Spectro-
graph (IRIS), and the Learmonth Solar Observatory (LSO) of the National Solar
Observatory/Global Oscillation Network Group (NSO/GONG). AR 12740 was
a decaying region formed by a very disperse following polarity and a strong
leading spot, surrounded by a highly dynamic zone where moving magnetic
features (MMFs) were seen constantly diverging from the spot. Our analysis
indicates that the ﬁlament was formed by the convergence of ﬁbrils at a location
where magnetic ﬂux cancellation was observed. Furthermore, we conclude that
its destabilization was also related to ﬂux cancellation associated to the constant
shuﬄing of the MMFs. A two-ribbon ﬂare occurred associated to the ﬁlament
eruption; however, because the large-scale magnetic conﬁguration of the AR was
quadrupolar, two additional ﬂare ribbons developed far from the two main ones.
We model the magnetic conﬁguration of the AR using a force-free ﬁeld approach
at the AR scale size. This local model is complemented by a global potential-ﬁeld
source-surface one. Based on the local model, we propose a scenario in which
the ﬁlament failed eruption and ﬂare are due to two reconnection processes,
one occurring below the erupting ﬁlament, leading to the two-ribbon ﬂare, and
another one above it between the ﬁlament ﬂux-rope conﬁguration and the large-
scale closed loops. Our computation of the reconnected magnetic ﬂux added to
the erupting ﬂux rope, compared to that of the large-scale ﬁeld overlying it, lets
us conclude that the latter was large enough to prevent the ﬁlament eruption. A
similar conjecture can be drawn from the computation of the magnetic tension
derived from the global ﬁeld model.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬁlaments are clouds of cool and dense plasma suspended against gravity
by forces thought to be of magnetic origin. Filaments appear in Hα, Ca ii
images as dark features on the disk and as bright loops at the limb; this is
well explained by absorption and emission mechanisms. Prominences are bright
also in transition region lines (He ii 304 ˚A) mapping the prominence-corona

transition region, but dark in some extreme ultraviolet (EUV) ﬁltergrams due
to continuum photoionization phenomena, e.g. Fe xi 171 ˚A (Labrosse et al.,
2010). The main plasma characteristics of prominences are reviewed in Labrosse
et al. (2010), while their magnetic properties are discussed in the articles by
Mackay et al. (2010) and Gibson (2018).

Prominences form along the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) in or be-
tween active regions. Early observations already suggested that their ﬁne struc-
ture is apparently composed by many horizontal and thin dark threads (Leroy,
Bommier, and Sahal-Brechot, 1983; Bommier, Sahal-Brechot, and Leroy, 1986;
Tandberg-Hanssen, 1995), as it has been conﬁrmed by observations using several
telescopes, i.e., the T´elescope H´eliographique pour l’Etude du Magn´etisme et des
Instabilit´es Solaires (THEMIS) (L´opez Ariste et al., 2006; Schmieder et al., 2014;
Levens et al., 2016), the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on the Hinode satellite
(Berger et al., 2008), and the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST, Shen et al.,
2015). Some ﬁne nearly horizontal plasma structures, lying in magnetic dips
above parasitic polarities located in the ﬁlament channel, form the ﬁlament feet
or barbs while the endpoints are anchored in the background magnetic ﬁeld
(L´opez Ariste et al., 2006). The distance between these feet has a characteristic
length comparable to the size of supergranules (30 Mm). Even if prominences
appear sometimes as hanging vertically over the limb their global structure is
almost horizontal (Martin, 1998; Chae et al., 2008). Dynamics and projection
eﬀects could be responsible of such non-real appearance (Schmieder et al., 2017).
Magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models
have conﬁrmed that the global structure of prominences consists of ﬂux tubes
or arcades of twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines which have shallow dips in which cool
plasma is trapped (Aulanier and D´emoulin, 1998; van Ballegooijen, 2004). In
this aspect, prominences can be the cores of coronal-mass-ejection (CME) ﬂux
ropes (Fan, 2015) and their eruptions are the drivers of ﬂares (Devi et al., 2021),
in general, of the two-ribbon type (see e.g. the standard model of ﬂares discussed
in Aulanier et al., 2010; Schmieder, D´emoulin, and Aulanier, 2013).

The review by Mackay et al. (2010, and references therein) discusses the
formation mechanisms of prominences. Diﬀerent models are proposed based
on levitation, evaporation and condensation processes. More recently, Gibson
(2018) describes the formation of prominences and the structure of the magnetic
skeleton that supports and surrounds the prominence, as well as how the plasma
and magnetic ﬁeld dynamically interact. Magnetic reconnection between short
ﬁlaments or chromospheric ﬁbrils, sometimes accompanied by bidirectional jets
(Tian et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017; Ruan et al., 2019; Shen, 2021), may lead
to the formation of long ﬁlaments (Schmieder et al., 2004, 2006; Wang and
Muglach, 2007); when this process happens close to parasitic polarities it may
favour the formation of barbs. Such magnetic conﬁgurations correspond to the
models proposed by van Ballegooijen and Martens (1989).

High-resolution observations of coronal jets, mostly of the blow-out kind,
have identiﬁed the presence and eruption of small-scale ﬁlaments, called miniﬁla-
ments, as being part of the ejected material (Hong et al., 2011; Shen, Liu, and Su,
2012; Sterling et al., 2015, 2016; Panesar, Sterling, and Moore, 2017; Yang and
Zhang, 2018; Moore, Sterling, and Panesar, 2018; Shen et al., 2019). In another

Joshi et al.

example, based on the analysis of lower resolution observations, the presence of a
constantly reformed miniﬁlament and its eruption was proposed as the origin of
a series of blow-out jets and the chain of events following them (ﬂares and narrow
CMEs, Chandra et al., 2017a). The mechanism associated to the destabilization
of the miniﬁlament, as also happens with well-developed ﬁlaments, was the
cancellation of magnetic ﬂux along the polarity inversion line (PIL). Magnetic
reconnection below the miniﬁlament was responsible for an observed ﬂare, while
the same process above the miniﬁlament favoured the injection of its material
into open ﬁeld lines to form the blow-out jet. The identiﬁcation of miniﬁlament
eruptions as the main origin of the plasma ejected in these jets led Wyper,
Antiochos, and DeVore (2017) and Wyper, DeVore, and Antiochos (2018) to
propose that these ejections are produced by a break-out mechanism similar to
the one proposed to explain larger events like CMEs (see Karpen, Antiochos, and
DeVore, 2012). Several articles have reviewed diﬀerent explanations (magnetic
ﬂux emergence and cancellation) for the origin of standard and blow-out jets
using imaging and spectroscopic observations (see e.g. Shen, 2021; Schmieder,
2022, and references therein).

In general, not all eruptions end in a CME; there are partial and failed erup-
tions. A number of ﬂux ropes and the embedded prominences suﬀer the later
kind of ejections, which imply that at ﬁrst they suddenly start to ascend, then
decelerate, and stop raising at some larger height in the corona. Several cases of
failed eruptions have been reported in the literature (Shen, Liu, and Su, 2012;
Chen, Ma, and Zhang, 2013; Joshi et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2015; Thalmann
et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2017b; Nistic`o et al., 2017; Liu
et al., 2018; Filippov, 2020, 2021). Chen, Ma, and Zhang (2013) and Xue et al.
(2016) interpreted an unsuccessful eruption because of the presence of strong
closed overlying EUV arcades. An asymmetry of the background magnetic ﬁeld,
considering only the relative location of the ﬁlament, has been suggested as the
origin of failed eruptions (Liu et al., 2009). Joshi et al. (2013) studied the event of
17 June 2012; they discussed that the eruption of the ﬂux rope and its ﬁlament
could fail even after they reached up to the Large Angle and Spectrographic
Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 ﬁeld of view (FOV) and were visible as a CME.
These authors associated the failed CME to an asymmetric ﬁlament eruption.
Thalmann et al. (2015) concluded that the strong overlying magnetic ﬁeld over
the active region (AR) 12192 in October 2014 prevented any CME to occur asso-
ciated to X-class ﬂares . A comparative study of eruptive and non-eruptive events
was performed by Liu et al. (2018). These authors explained non-eruptive events
proposing two possibilities: ﬁrstly, the active region non-potentiality and a weak
Lorentz force could be responsible for the small momentum of the ejecta and,
secondly, the torus-stability region conﬁned the eruption (see T¨or¨ok and Kliem,
2005; Zuccarello, Aulanier, and Gilchrist, 2016, for a discussion on the role of
the torus instability). Very recently Filippov (2021) estimated the mass of ﬁfteen
failed eruptive prominences using the model of a partial current-carrying torus
loop anchored to the photosphere. Based on these calculations, they concluded
that the gravity force could be the most suitable agent to stop the ﬁlament
eruption. On the other hand, based on simulations, the articles by Fan and
Gibson (2003); Amari et al. (2018) propose a simple solution, i.e. a ﬂux rope

Multi-Ribbon Flare and Failed Filament Eruption

and embedded ﬁlament do not erupt because of the overlying ﬁeld that Amari
et al. (2018) call a magnetic cage.

Figure 1. Full-disk images showing AR 12740 (white box) in: (a) AIA 304 ˚A band and (b) in
GONG Learmonth Hα image on 09 May 2019 at 05:39 UT including a zoom on the ﬁlament.
The white box in panel b covers the FOV of Figs. 5 and 6.

In this article we present ground and space-based observations (Sect. 2) of a
sequence of events (Sect. 3) that ended with the failed eruption of a ﬁlament.
The chain of events (ﬁlament formation, failed eruption, and associated ﬂare)
occurred on 9 May 2019 in the decaying AR 12740, where the main sunspot
was surrounded by a moat region, as well as several small bipole emergences.
Consequently, we observe locations of emerging and cancelling ﬂux leading ﬁrst
to the ﬁlament formation (Sect. 3.2) and later to its eruption (Sect. 3.4). The
eruption, which failed, was accompanied by a ﬂare (Sect. 3.3) of C6.7 X-ray class
recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
starting at 05:40 UT, a maximum at 05:51 UT, and an extension of around
two hours. Figure 1 shows AR 12740 in full disk images at the time of the ﬂare.
We present local and global magnetic ﬁeld models in Sect. 4 and, based on our
modeling and observations, we propose a scenario to explain the observed events
(Sect. 4.3). Finally, we summarize and conclude in Sect. 5.

2. The Data Used

To analyse the series of events that occurred in AR 12740 on 9 May 2019, we
use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) data from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012), on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), EUV observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager
(EUVI: Wuelser et al., 2004) of the Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and He-
liospheric Investigation suite (SECCHI: Howard et al., 2008), on board the
Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft A, and from the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS: De Pontieu et al., 2014). Hα data
come from the Learmonth Solar Observatory (LSO) of the National Solar Ob-
servatory/Global Oscillation Network Group (NSO/GONG) and magnetograms

SOLA: FailedFilamentRev.tex; 2 June 2022; 0:39; p. 5

Joshi et al.

from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012), on
board SDO.

AIA provides full-disk images at seven EUV and two UV wavebands, with a
pixel size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) and a cadence of 12 s and 24 s for EUV and UV, respectively.
The higher temperature wavebands, including 94 ˚A (6.3 MK), 131 ˚A (0.40 MK,
10 MK, 16 MK), 171 ˚A (0.63 MK), 193 ˚A (1.3 MK, 20 MK), 211 ˚A (2.0 MK),
and 335 ˚A (2.5 MK), typically show features in the corona such as loops. The
lower temperature wavebands, 304 ˚A (0.050 MK), 1600 ˚A (0.10 MK), and 1700
˚A (continuum) are sensitive to heating in the chromosphere. In our analysis we
use 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, and 1600 ˚A bands (henceforth, AIA 304, AIA 171, and AIA
1600). We select, from the full-disk images, subimages containing the region of
interest. The images are coaligned to compensate for solar rotation and the
movies that accompany this article are constructed (Sect. 3.3). The images
are either displayed in logarithmic intensity scale for better contrast or using
the multi-scale Gaussian normalization (MGN: Morgan and Druckm¨uller, 2014)
processing technique.

We complement the SDO/AIA data with full-disk observations in the 304 and
195 ˚A channels of the STEREO-A/EUVI instrument (henceforth, EUVI-A 304
and EUVI-A 195). EUVI provides images with a pixel size of 1.6(cid:48)(cid:48) and a temporal
cadence of 10 minutes for EUVI-A 304 and 5 minutes for EUVI-A 195 during
the analysed events. On 09 May 2019, the STEREO-A spacecraft was located
at an Earth ecliptic (HEE) longitude of -95◦; from this location AR 12740 was
seen at the west solar limb.

IRIS observed AR 12740 between 04:54 UT and 06:21 UT in the mode of
very dense rasters and, simultaneously, obtained slit jaw images (SJIs) centered
on the AR with a FOV of 167 × 175 in four channels around 1330 ˚A, 1400 ˚A,
2796 ˚A, and 2832 ˚A, including C ii, Si iv, Mg ii lines, and the UV continuum,
respectively. C ii is formed around T = 30000 K and Si iv around 80000 K, while
Mg ii is formed at chromospheric temperatures between 8000 K and 20000 K.
The cadence of the SJIs is 65 sec and the pixel size is 0.35(cid:48)(cid:48).

The Hα data come from LSO and have a spatial resolution of approximately
2(cid:48)(cid:48); they are obtained with a cadence of 1 min. The analysed SDO/HMI data con-
sist of line-of-sight (LOS) full-disk magnetograms (0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) pixel size) and synoptic
maps. As done for AIA, we select from the full-disk magnetograms subimages
centered in the AR and, after coalignment, we construct the movies that are
attached to this article (Sect. 3.1). The magnetograms are used to study the
evolution of the AR magnetic ﬁeld, as described in Sect. 3.1 (with 45 s ca-
dence), and as boundary condition for the local model described in Sect. 4.2
(720 s cadence). HMI synoptic maps are computed from LOS magnetograms by
combining central meridian data from 20 magnetograms collected along a 4-hour
interval each day. A synoptic map is made with the magnetograms observed over
a full solar rotation with 3600 × 1440 steps in longitude and sine latitude. Details
concerning the construction of synoptic maps can be found in the HMI web-site
jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/SynopticMaps; the map for Carrington rotation (CR)
2217 is used as boundary condition for the model in Sect. 4.4.

magnetic ﬂux cancellation probably related to the events that occurred on 9 May 2019; they
are pointed with arrows and labelled as a, b, and c. Diﬀerent magnetic polarities (or their
extensions) that are relevant to our study are indicated with numbers (or a number and a
letter). In both panels, white (black) regions correspond to positive (negative) LOS magnetic
ﬁeld measurements. The magnetic ﬁeld values have been saturated above (below) 300 G (-300
G). The size of each panel is 330(cid:48)(cid:48) in the E–W (east–west) and 244(cid:48)(cid:48) in the N-S (north-south)
direction. The center of each panel in heliographic coordinates is N06 E07 for the left panel
and N08 E01 for the right panel. A movie covering the evolution of AR 12740 from 7 to 9 May
2019 accompanies this ﬁgure (HMI 7-9May2019 Fig2.mp4); the magnetic ﬁeld values have been
saturated above (below) 500 G (-500 G) for a better visualization of bipole emergences and
changes along these days.

3. The Events on 9 May 2019 in AR 12740

3.1. The Magnetic Field Evolution

AR 12740 appeared on the eastern solar limb on 4 May 2019. By the time of
the events described in this article it was located at N10 E07. This AR is the
return of AR 12738 on the previous CR. Figure 2 shows the magnetic ﬁeld
distribution on 12 April and 9 May 2019. On 12 April, AR 12738 consisted
of a leading concentrated negative polarity spot already in its decaying phase
followed by a disperse positive polarity to the east. An extended moat region was
present around the main negative polarity. Moat regions (see van Driel-Gesztelyi
and Green, 2015, and references therein), which appear mostly around evolved
and decaying spots play a key role in transporting ﬂux away from spots and,
therefore, contributing to their decay. Furthermore, moat regions are the sites of
active phenomena, e.g. eruptions and recurrent jets (Chen et al., 2015; Chandra
et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2018). The moat region around the strong negative spot
in AR 12738 was also present one rotation later (compare both panels in Fig. 2).
The evolution of the moat region is well visible in the panels presented in
Fig. 3 and the accompanying movie. This ﬁgure shows the leading negative spot
(red oval) surrounded by a part of the moat region (yellow circle). The main spot
decreases in size while small magnetic features, called moving magnetic features
(MMFs: Harvey and Harvey, 1973) move away from the spot (see arrows).

Joshi et al.

Figure 3. Evolution of part of the moat region surrounding the leading negative spot between
00:08:05 UT and 06:58:20 UT on 9 May 2019. White/cyan arrows indicate negative/positive
MMFs rapidly changing. The red oval and the yellow circle have the same size in all the
panels; this facilitates the visualization of the contraction of the main negative polarity and
the expansion of the region where MMFs are visible. In panel (c) red boxes a, b, c, similar to
those in Fig. 2, are drawn and indicated by red arrows. The magnetic ﬁeld values have been
saturated above (below) 400 G (-400 G). A movie with a similar FOV and of similar saturation
accompanies this ﬁgure (HMI 09May2019 Fig3.mp4).

Besides this constant radial motion of the MMFs, we observe the emergence
of several small bipoles toward the north of the main spot that made the full
conﬁguration highly dynamic (see the movie HMI 09May2019 Fig3.mp4). These
series of emergences and their consequent evolution created a PIL nearly E-W
oriented where a ﬁlament formed as discussed in Sect. 3.2.

We also identify several locations where ﬂux cancellation occurred. Some of
them are relevant to either the ﬁlament formation or its destabilization as dis-
cussed in Sects. 3.2 and 3.4, i.e. see the rectangular boxes in Fig. 2 (right panel)
pointed with arrows and labelled as a, b, and c. Figure 4 shows the evolution of
the positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes within these boxes. Panel a corresponds
to the region (labelled as a in Fig. 2) where we identify the merging of two
elongated and wide ﬁbrils that ﬁnally formed a curved ﬁlament (see Fig. 5 and
Sect. 3.2); notice that only the positive ﬂux is seen decreasing while the negative
ﬂux increases as it enters the southern boundary of this northern box. Panel b
corresponds to the region (labelled as b in Fig. 2) where we start observing the
development of the two main ribbons of the C6.7 ﬂare (see Sect. 3.3); notice
that in this case both negative and positive ﬂuxes steadily decrease from around
03:10 UT until around 05:50 UT. Panel c shows the ﬂux evolution in the rectangle
(labelled as c in Fig. 2). As in the case of region a, only the positive ﬂux is seen
decreasing after around 03:10 UT because negative ﬂux, advected by the moat
ﬂow, enters the southern border of this rectangle. This region (c) could be related
to the ﬁlament destabilization (see the discussion in Sect. 3.3).

Multi-Ribbon Flare and Failed Filament Eruption

Figure 4. Evolution of the positive and absolute value of the negative magnetic ﬂuxes in
regions related to the ﬁlament formation and eruption. (a) Corresponds to the region within
the rectangle labelled as a in Fig. 2 where two long and wide ﬁbrils merge to form the curved
AR ﬁlament. (b) and (c) Show the ﬂux evolution in regions labelled as b and c in Fig. 2
that can be associated to the ﬁlament eruption. Notice that in panel b the blue asterisks are
multiplied by 2. Computations are done for values of the ﬁeld above 10 G and the error bars
are calculated considering a magnetic ﬁeld error of 5 G.

By the beginning of the ﬂare and ﬁlament eruption (see Sects. 3.3 and 3.4),
the magnetic ﬁeld distribution is the one depicted in the right panel of Fig. 2.
Since the magnetic conﬁguration and its evolution is complex, we ﬁrst limit its
description to the quadrupolar conﬁguration relevant for the studied ﬂare and
ﬁlament eruption. This involves polarities 1, 2, 3, and 4. Polarities 1 and 4 are
the main ones of the AR. Polarity 2, which dramatically evolves in the hours
previous to the ﬂare, adds up to the quadrupolar layout. The fourth polarity
that we call 3 is located to the west of polarity 1; following the evolution of the
moat region around the main AR negative spot, this chain of polarities is formed
by the MMFs moving away from the big spot.

In Fig. 2, we have also labeled the extension of polarity 1, which ends at
the border of a supergranular cell to the east, as 1E, as well as a north-western
negative polarity that we call 5. This polarity is part of a bipole that emerged
as early as 7 May 2019 at around 20:50 UT and evolved to the position shown
in Fig. 2 on 9 May; the positive bipole polarity is located to its north. Both 3
and 5 serve as a reference for our discussion in Sect. 4. A movie displays the
complex evolution of AR 12740 from early 7 May to 9 May after the ﬂare decay
(HMI 7-9May2019 Fig2.mp4).

3.2. The Filament Formation

A long and curved ﬁlament started forming a few hours before the ﬂare initiation
time at around 05:40 UT. Figure 5a shows sets of very long, wide, and winding
ﬁbrils at 02:00 UT in AIA 304. Part of these ﬁbrils were involved in the merging
process to form the long ﬁlament (Fig. 5d). These ﬁbril arcades evolved as time
went on and seemed to merge at the location of magnetic ﬂux cancellation; the
white arrow in panel a points approximately to the magnetic ﬂux cancellation
site called a in Fig. 2 (right panel), whose evolution is shown in Fig. 4a. Panels

main sunspot in AR 12740 observed in AIA 304 (panels a-e) on 9 May 2019. Flux cancellation
occurred in site a around 02:40 UT and continue (see arrows in panels a and b and the
discussion in the text); this favored the formation of a long curved structure. See text for the
description of the evolution of this structure and the appearance of minor brightenings. A movie
extending from 01:00 UT to 07:00 UT on 9 May accompanies this ﬁgure and Fig. 6 (AIA304
09May2019 Fig3 Fig6.mp4). HMI contours of ±100 Gauss (magenta/green for positive/negative
polarities) are overlaid in panel e. Panel f presents Hα observations of the ﬁlament one minute
before ﬂare onset; its two parts are labelled as part 1 and part 2 and are pointed with white
arrows (see text).

b and c of Fig. 5 depict this evolution. However, because the ﬂux cancellation
process was accompanied by minor brightenings (see the light blue arrow in
panel b), the elongated and curved ﬁlament structure appears interrupted by
them as can be better seen in panel c. We have called part 1 (labelled in Fig. 5f)
to the eastern ﬁbril arcade. Its negative polarity footpoints lie on the negative
polarity at the ﬂux cancellation site a. Its other footpoints are anchored in the
E-W branch of the positive polarity called 2 in Fig. 2 (right panel). Notice that
polarity 2 has a global L-shape, with the longest part of the L in the N-S direction
and the shortest in the E-W direction. Furthermore, by the time of all panels in
Fig. 5 an L-shape plage brightening is seen tracing the polarity global shape. On
the other hand, we have called part 2 (labelled in Fig. 5f) to the western ﬁbril
arcade with positive polarity footpoints at site a and negative footpoints most
probably anchored in the disperse negative polarity 3 to the west of the leading
spot (see Fig. 2, right panel). By around 04:20 UT (see Fig. 5d), the ﬁlament
appeared as a single elongated and curved structure following the complex PIL
created by the dynamics of the constant shuﬄing of the MMFs. However, by
around 05:26 UT (see Fig. 5e), the ﬁlament appears again as separated in two
parts because of a brightening associated to the ﬂux cancellation site called c in
Fig. 2 (right panel). When seen in a high-time resolution movie in AIA 304, this
bright kernel marked by a light blue arrow in Fig. 5e, corresponds to a small and
localized jet and is not associated to the main C6.7 ﬂare. Later, by 05:39 UT,
one minute before ﬂare onset in GOES, the ﬁlament is seen as a long curved
structure in Hα (see panel f).

Multi-Ribbon Flare and Failed Filament Eruption

In summary, the ﬁlament is associated to opposite polarities converging and
cancelling. This builds up progressively a coherent structure. Our observations
agree and add up to previous studies. Indeed, the evolution of ﬁbrils merging and
forming a ﬁlament has been already observed in cases where a ﬁlament formed
from a loop arcade (see e.g. Guo et al., 2010). Furthermore, the basic process of
ﬂux cancellation at ﬁbril footpoints creating long magnetic ﬁeld lines is also well
described by van Ballegooijen and Martens (1989) and Schmieder et al. (2004).
Filament formation from magnetic reconnection between adjacent short ﬁlament
threads was observed and analysed in EUV and Hα observations (Yang et al.,
2016; Xue et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). This kind of merging of short threads
or ﬁbrils through magnetic reconnection can originate bi-directional jets along
the newly formed structure (Tian et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017). We also observe
these jets in an IRIS spectrum movie of our case study; however, it is out of the
scope of this article to analyse IRIS spectra, we just add that bi-directional jets
found in IRIS SJIs and spectra are well discussed in previous articles (Ruan
et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2021).

3.3. The Flare and Its Multiple Ribbons

The evolution of the C6.7 ﬂare is shown in three AIA wavelength ranges (AIA
1600 ˚A, AIA 304 ˚A, and AIA 171 ˚A) in Fig. 6 and in IRIS 1330 ˚A channel SJIs
(Fig. 7); notice that AIA images depict a larger FOV than that of IRIS. Two
movies with diﬀerent temporal and spatial extensions accompany the ﬁgures
in this section, AIA304 09May2019 Fig3 Fig6.mp4 and IRIS CII 09May2019 Fig7.
mp4. In both, despite the saturation in several images, the evolution of the ﬂare
and ﬁlament eruption at all of their stages can be followed.

Before describing the ﬂare temporal evolution, we deﬁne the labeling of the
distinctly observed ﬂare ribbons in Figs. 6 and 7 to facilitate our following
description. This C6.7 ﬂare consists mainly of a two-ribbon ﬂare that occurred
within the large quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration of the AR (see Fig. 2 right
panel). The double ribbons of the two-ribbon ﬂare are called 2R (for two-ribbon
ﬂare) followed by a number that corresponds to the polarity number where the
ribbon is located as shown in Fig. 2. We have also identiﬁed two additional
ribbons, R3 located on the western and disperse negative polarity R3 and R4
located on polarity 4. These two ribbons are visible in Figs. 6 and 7 and in the
larger Hα FOV in Fig. 9.

By around 05:43 UT the L-shape brightening, described in Sect. 3.2, is the
most evident feature in the three AIA bands (see Fig. 6), from chromospheric
to low coronal temperatures. The evolution of the two-ribbon ﬂare starts along
the E-W extension of this brightening. The separation of its main bands is clear
and increasing as in a typical two-ribbon ﬂare in panels c, d, g, and h of Fig. 6
of both AIA 1600 and AIA 304. The relative shift of these two ribbons along the
PIL indicates the presence of high magnetic shear at that location. Concerning
IRIS, we focus on the C ii band pass SJIs, in this band the two main ribbons are
observed already at 05:43 UT in Fig. 7a because IRIS SJIs have higher spatial
and spectral resolution than AIA images though a smaller FOV. Their evolution
and separation is clearer than in Fig. 6.

2019. The left column corresponds to AIA 1600, the middle column to AIA 304, and the right
column to AIA 171. The box in panel f indicates the FOV of IRIS. The main ﬂare ribbons
visible in AIA 1600 are pointed with arrows in panel c and in AIA 304 in panel g. The western
portion of the ﬁlament, which erupted few minutes after the eastern portion, is pointed with
an arrow in panels e and f of AIA 304 images. Black arrows in panels g, h, k, and l indicate
the northern edge of the heated ﬁlament plasma as it erupts. See text for the description of
this ﬁgure and the movie AIA304 09May2019 Fig3 Fig6.mp4.

By around 05:49 UT, a ribbon that we label as R3 in panels c and g of Fig. 6
is present to the west of the FOV on polarity 3. Simultaneously, another very
elongated brightening is clearly seen to the east in Fig. 6g and h, we have labeled
it as R4. In the higher temperature AIA band, AIA 171, the northern portion
of R4 appears in Fig. 6j and its shape can be guessed in panels k and l. In a
similar way as with the main ribbons 2R1 and 2R2, R3 is better seen in Fig. 7c
and d; however, R4 is not visible because of the reduced IRIS FOV.

Based on the appearance of the distant ribbons, R3 and R4, and our magnetic
ﬁeld model in Sect. 4.2, we conclude that the counterparts of R3 and R4 should
be located on polarities 1 and 2 but we are not able to separate them clearly
from 2R1 and 2R2. That is why, we have labeled the extended ribbons along
polarities 1 and 2 as R1+2R1 and R2+2R2 (see Figs. 6 and 7) to indicate that

they are possibly a combination of the main ribbons of the two-ribbon ﬂare and
the counterparts of R3 and R4 within the quadrupolar AR conﬁguration.

Another feature, better seen at ≈ 05:47 UT in Fig. 7d, is a curved brightening
to the north of R3. This brightening is located on polarity 5 and the ﬁeld line
connectivity derived in Sect. 4.2 lets us conclude that it is not related to the
C6.7 ﬂare.

3.4. Failed Eruption of the Filament

In this section we describe the diﬀerent observed stages of the ﬁlament eruption,
from its lift oﬀ to the return of its plasma after its eruption has failed. We
ﬁrst discuss the observations as seen at the solar limb by EUVI in STEREO-A
because from them, we can derive the ejection direction to help understanding
the eruption as seen from Earth’s perspective.

3.4.1. The Failed Eruption from STEREO-A Point of View

At the time of the event, STEREO-A was at a privileged location to observe the
coronal activity related to AR 12740. From the STEREO-A point of view, AR
12740 appeared on its western solar limb, as shown in Figure 8. The panels of this
ﬁgure correspond to EUVI-A 304 and 195 at diﬀerent times from a few minutes
after the beginning of the ﬂare, when it is clearly seen on the limb of STEREO-A,
and cover the ﬁlament eruption and consequent observation of plasma downﬂows.
In this ﬁgure pairs of panels at similar hours are shown side by side for both
channels. The images in these panels are shown in a gray-reversed scale and have
been processed using a wavelet transform (see Stenborg, Vourlidas, and Howard,
2008). We point the reader to the movies that can be generated at cdaw.gsfc.

The vantage point of view of STEREO-A provides information on the failed
eruption, which is inaccessible from Earth’s line of sight. We have used EUVI-A
304 and 195 images to compute the angles that the N-S and radial directions
made with the average direction of the upﬂowing plasma. These angles are
estimated from the pair of panels at the top right in Figure 8, where the average
direction of the plasma upﬂow is shown with a red solid line and the radial and
the N-S directions with blue ones. The dashed-red lines indicate the plasma ejec-
tion width as projected on the plane-of-the-sky. The measured angles are almost
the same for both channels: ≈ 15◦ and ≈ 60◦ with respect to the N-S and radial
directions, respectively. These values can be used to correct those of variables

computed using data obtained from Earth’s point of view (see Sect. 3.4.2 and
Sect. 4.4).

We observed a CME whose leading edge appeared in STEREO-A COR1 FOV
at 05:55 UT. However, we could not identify the CME source region in AIA
images. Furthermore, the probable CME launch time, considering its projected
speed in COR1-A images, would be before the start of the C6.7 ﬂare. Therefore,
we conclude that this CME is not related to the ﬁlament eruption we study (see
Appendix).

3.4.2. The Failed Eruption from Earth’s Point of View

In this section we discuss the diﬀerent stages of the ﬁlament eruption as seen from
Earth. We refer to the previously described Figs. 6 and 7, stressing the aspects
relevant to the eruption (see also movies AIA304 09May2019 Fig3 Fig6.mp4 and
IRIS CII 09May2019 Fig7.mp4). To these ﬁgures, we add Figs. 9 and 10 that
depict a larger FOV.

In Sect. 3.3 we have shown the existence of the two ribbons related to the
C6.7 ﬂare located in the center of the active region, respectively, R1+2R1 and
R2+2R2. The later is the L-shape ribbon well visible in Fig. 7d at 05:47 UT.
Before this time, we already observe the lift oﬀ of part 1 of the ﬁlament as
indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 7b. In the movie of IRIS we observe that
this brightening becomes more diﬀuse and extends. Around 05:47 UT part 2 of
the ﬁlament escapes. To the north of the two ribbons, we clearly see a large diﬀuse

area with a bright northern edge oriented NE-SW (black arrow in Fig. 7d). This
large diﬀuse area is also visible later on at 05:49 UT in AIA 304 ˚A (Fig. 6g).
As part 2 lifts, the whole ﬁlament appears as a large ﬂux rope with a NE-SW
orientation after 05:49 UT (black arrows in Fig. 6g, k, h and l).

The evolution just described, as well as the location of the two main ribbons,
described in Sect. 3.3, lets us speculate that probably magnetic ﬂux cancellation
at sites b and c (see Figs. 2 and 3 and Sect. 3.1) may have played a role in
the ﬁlament destabilization and eruption. In the higher temperature AIA band,
AIA 171, the most evident feature is the presence of the heated plasma extending
upward in Fig. 6j,k,l; notice that part of the ﬁlament plasma seems to be ﬂowing
back already at around 05:51 UT.

We can continue observing the journey of the erupting plasma in Hα and
AIA 171 in a larger FOV in Figs. 9 and 10, and the corresponding movies after
06:00 UT until ≈ 06:20 UT. The AR viewed in AIA 171 is covered by a bright
area of loops and straight features to its north (see white and green arrows in
Fig. 10b,c). The Hα material is seen to move upwards in Fig. 9d,e. However,
simultaneously, the plasma is also observed falling down, dark in Hα and bright
in AIA 171 in both panels f of Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. The falling down material is
progressively stack along large scale loops mostly visible in AIA 171 until 06:39
UT (Fig 10f).

Multi-Ribbon Flare and Failed Filament Eruption

Figure 11. Height-time analysis of the ﬁlament eruption in AIA 171. The upward and down-
ward projected motion of the plasma is measured along the N-S white slit in panel a on the
AIA 171 image. The slit for constructing the stack plot is chosen manually by eye and roughly
agrees with the central location of the ﬁlament part 1. Panel b corresponds to a stack plot
built along the slit. For a better visibility of the upward- and downward-moving material, we
have used the MGN technique to process the images used to build this plot. The white-dashed
line in this panel is drawn manually, following the leading edge of the material moving ﬁrst
upward and later downward.

To evaluate the speed of the rising and falling plasma we have built a stack
plot along the N-S line that is shown in Fig. 11a. Since the eruption of the
ﬁlament, as well as the falling back of the plasma, is complex and appears to
occur at diﬀerent stages and along diﬀerent directions, we have chosen only one
direction that roughly agrees with the central location of the ﬁlament part 1 to
have average speed estimations. Using the slopes of the white-dashed line, drawn
by hand in Fig. 11b, which follows the leading edge of the material along the N-S
line in panel a, we estimate a speed projected on the plane-of-the-sky of 190 km
s−1 for the upﬂow and 60 km s−1 for the downﬂow. We deproject these values in
the direction of the eruption using the angles measured in EUVI-A 304 and 195
in Sect. 3.4.1; when doing so, we obtain 201 km s−1 and 62 km s−1, respectively.
These values are quite similar to those found on the plane-of-the-sky because
of the very small angle between the directions N-S and that of the eruption.
We also measure the distance reached by the plasma along the N-S direction,
computed from around 70(cid:48)(cid:48) in Fig. 11b where the intense ﬂare emission is seen
in AIA 171, and ﬁnd a value of ≈ 270 Mm; this corresponds to a distance of
≈ 280 Mm along the plasma ejection direction (assumed to be along a straight
line).

4. Coronal Field Model of the Events on 9 May 2019

4.1. Overview

Following our multi-wavelength analysis of the phenomena in AR 12740 on 9 May
2019, we present in Sect. 4.2 a ﬂare model of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration
at the AR scale size. The ﬁeld line connectivity derived from this model lets us
propose a possible physical scenario (Sect. 4.3) and interpretation of the complex

chain of events we have analysed. This section is followed by a global magnetic
ﬁeld model (Sect. 4.4) that complements and supports our proposed scenario
and interpretation.

4.2. Local Magnetic Field Model

To understand the role of the diﬀerent magnetic polarities in AR 12740, we model
its coronal ﬁeld. We extrapolate the HMI LOS magnetic ﬁeld to the corona using
the discrete fast Fourier transform method described by Alissandrakis (1981),
under the linear force-free ﬁeld (LFFF) approach (∇ × B = αB, with α con-
stant). Although this kind of modeling cannot take into account the distribution
of currents at the photospheric level and the strong shear that we can infer from
the shape and location of the ribbons of the two-ribbon ﬂare, but only the shear
in the global magnetic conﬁguration, its computation is fast and has proven
to be eﬃcient to determine the magnetic ﬁeld structure at the scale size of an
AR, which can be later compared with observed active events (see e.g. Mandrini
et al., 2006, 2014, and references therein).

set of blue ﬁeld lines derived from the coronal model overlaid on the same AIA

the external reconnection process discussed in the text (see Sect. 4.3). The set in black color

observed frame so that our models can be directly compared to the data (see
the Appendix in D´emoulin et al., 1997). The value of α, the free parameter of
the model, is set to best match these large-scale loops (as discussed in Green
et al., 2002). The best-matching value is α = 9.4 × 10−3 Mm−1. This large-
scale loops are also present several hours after the ﬂare has ended, as can be
seen in images displayed in Helioviewer (helioviewer.org/), which means that the
large-scale conﬁguration persists.

Figure 13 right panel depicts an AIA 304 image 3 min before ﬂare maximum
(05:48:29 UT). The ﬂare ribbons corresponding to the two-ribbon ﬂare as those
associated to the quadrupolar conﬁguration have been labelled as indicated in
Sect. 3.3. Figure 13 left panel displays a set of red ﬁeld lines derived from the
coronal model overlaid on the same AIA image. Since no ﬂare loop is observed to
compare with our computed ﬁeld lines, the value of α is set so that the computed
ﬁeld lines connect the observed ribbons. The best-connecting value is higher than
in Fig. 12, α = 1.6 × 10−2 Mm−1 and double this value for the sets of lines to
the East and West, respectively. See the caption to this ﬁgure for an explanation
of the set of black lines.

Finally, we model the loops observed during the ﬂare decay phase that are
observed between the two main ﬂare ribbons. Figure 14 right panel depicts an

4.3. The Stages of the Observed Events

The results of the three just described models, together with our data analysis,
leads us to the following conclusions about the origin of the C6.7 ﬂare and its
evolution. The connectivity determined from each model provides only a static
view at the time it is computed; therefore, to facilitate our discussion of the
diﬀerent stages of the events and the processes that occur, we include the scheme
shown in Fig. 15. This sketch is similar to the one proposed by L´opez Fuentes
et al. (2018) and Poisson et al. (2020) for a failed mini-ﬁlament eruption.

The situation depicted in Fig. 15 corresponds to a time at which the mag-
netic conﬁguration containing the ﬁlament, drawn as a green oval, was already
destabilized and rising. Probably, magnetic ﬂux cancellation occurring at sites b
and c destabilizes the ﬁlament magnetic conﬁguration that starts erupting (see
references in Sect. 1 about ﬁlament eruptions driven by ﬂux cancellation). A set
of ﬁeld lines (anchored between 1–2) overlays the ﬁlament that is located along
the main AR PIL (see the elongated blue line lying above the ﬁlament). The
set of long blue ﬁeld lines (anchored between 3 and 4, see Fig 12 left panel and
Fig. 15) corresponds to the closed background ﬁeld.

Magnetic reconnection sets below the ﬁlament as happens in a classical promi-
nence eruption (see e.g. Aulanier et al., 2010; Webb and Howard, 2012). The
location of this reconnection process is represented by the green vertical segment

diﬀerent ribbons are indicated using the labels in Fig. 13. The ﬂux rope conﬁguration including
the ﬁlament is simpliﬁed to a 2D representation. As the ﬁlament (indicated as a green ellipse)
and its magnetic conﬁguration rise two reconnection processes occur, as identiﬁed with thick
green segments: the internal one below the ﬁlament and the external one above it. The former
process gives the observed two main ﬂare ribbons (2R1 and 2R2) located close to the base
of the pink line and joined by a red reconnected ﬁeld line. The latter process reconnects blue
ﬁeld lines (connecting regions on polarities 3 and 4) with blue elongated ﬁeld lines (connecting
1 and 2), which overlay the rising ﬁlament. This process eventually derives in the injection
of ﬁlament material in ﬁeld lines connecting 1 to 4 and 3 to 2, highlighted in red color. This
material is observed ﬂowing down (see orange arrows) along them pinpointing the ﬁlament
failed eruption (see Sect. 4.3 for a more detailed description). At the footpoints of the red lines
we observe ribbons R1 and R2, which cannot be clearly separated from the two main ﬂare
ribbons resulting from the internal reconnection process, and the farther ribbons R3 and R4.

lines in Fig. 14 left panel correspond to the reconnected lines resulting from this
process below this limiting pink line. The just described reconnection process
has been called internal in several articles (see e.g. Sterling et al., 2015; Moore,
Sterling, and Panesar, 2018).

As the ﬁlament conﬁguration moves up, ﬁeld lines located above the ﬁlament
(the blue elongated line in the sketch) start reconnecting with the large-scale blue
lines shown in our model in Fig. 12 left panel and outlined in blue in the sketch.
This second reconnection process, indicated by the green oblique segment, has
been called external in the just mentioned references.

As a result of the external reconnection process, the ﬁlament plasma and that
of the loops where it is still embedded, is injected into the red reconnected ﬁeld
lines. The material is seen ﬂowing down along them (as indicated by the orange
arrows in the sketch) and the eruption fails. The external reconnection process
decreases the magnetic tension above the ﬁlament ﬂux rope. However, if the

SOLA: FailedFilamentRev.tex; 2 June 2022; 0:39; p. 21

Joshi et al.

large-scale magnetic ﬁeld (in the blue arcade connecting 3 to 4) has more ﬂux
than that of the ﬂux rope, the later could be mostly reconnected and could not
continue upward.

To investigate the latter statement, we ﬁrst compute the magnetic ﬂux swept
by the ribbons of the two-ribbon ﬂare using AIA 1600 images overlaid on the
corresponding HMI magnetograms (the two ribbons are better seen and not
saturated in this AIA band). The ﬂux swept by the ribbons represents the ﬂux
added by reconnection to the erupting ﬂux rope (see e.g. Deng and Welsch,
2017, and references therein) and is a lower bound for the ﬂux rope total ﬂux.
This estimated average ﬂux is ≈ 1.5×1020 Mx for the time range 05:43 – 05:53
UT (see AIA 1600 images in Fig. 6a-d). As a second step, we compute the ﬂux
in the large-scale overlying arcade taking into account the region on polarity
4 that connects to polarity 3 in our local ﬁeld model (we use only polarity 4
because the counterpart region on polarity 3 is continuously evolving because of
the shuﬄing of MMFs). The ﬂux in the large scale arcade is ≈ 8.5×1020 Mx, ≈
6 times larger than the ﬂux rope ﬂux. This supports our assumption of a fully
reconnected erupting ﬂux rope. In addition to this, the kinetic energy of the
ﬁlament with a speed of 183 km s−1 could be too small for a successful eruption,
see e.g. Shen, Liu, and Liu (2011) who studied three ﬁlament eruptions, two
failed and one successful, and found that the ﬁlament velocity in the successful
one was the largest and that ﬁlament velocities were proportional to the power
of their ﬂares.

In summary, the ﬁrst internal reconnection process would result in the ob-
served intense two ribbons labelled as 2R1 and 2R2 in Figs. 13 (right panel)
and 15. They are located at both sides of the PIL between polarities 1 and 2,
and the very short post-ﬂare loops joining them (see Fig. 14 left panel). The
second external reconnection process is associated to ribbons R4, R3 and their
counterparts on polarities 1 and 2 that we have called R1 and R2 (Figs. 13 right
panel and 15). As already mentioned, these ribbons cannot be clearly separated
from the main two ﬂare ribbons and we just only have an idea of their location
based on the ﬁeld-line connectivity computed from our model shown in Fig. 13
left panel. In the studied event, as stated above, the second external reconnection
process is most relevant in impeding the ﬁlament ﬂux rope eruption.

4.4. Global Magnetic Field Model

Since our local ﬁeld model is limited to the scale size of the AR, we have com-
puted a global coronal magnetic model to verify that the magnetic conﬁguration
at this larger scale remains closed.

The global coronal magnetic ﬁeld of CR 2217 is modeled using a potential-ﬁeld
source-surface (PFSS) approach. These models assume a current-free coronal
ﬁeld with an observationally prescribed boundary condition at the photosphere.
PFSS models assume that the ﬁeld becomes purely radial at a given height called
the source surface, which in our case is set to a value of 2.5 R(cid:12). Our PFSS
model uses as its lower boundary condition the corresponding HMI magnetic
ﬁeld synoptic map.

Figure 16. Left panel: PFSS model of CR 2217 with AR 12740 located at Carrington longitude
318◦ on 9 May 2019 close to the ﬂare time. The ﬁeld-line color convention is such that black
indicates closed lines and pink (green) corresponds to open lines belonging to the negative
polarity (positive polarity) ﬁeld (notice that open implies reaching the source surface). Closed
ﬁeld lines connect the AR main negative sunspot to its following positive polarity as in the
model in Fig. 12. Notice that the curvature of this set of closed ﬁeld lines is diﬀerent from
the set shown in blue in that ﬁgure since this is a potential ﬁeld model, while the local ﬁeld
model considers the shear at the AR scale-size. Other closed lines connect north to quiet-Sun
regions as in Fig. 12 (lines shown in black) or to the positive ﬁeld of the trailing AR 12741.
The magnetic ﬁeld values have been smoothed and saturated above (below) 250 G (-250 G).
Right panel: AIA 171 full disk image as reference at the time corresponding to the Carrington
longitude in the left panel.

The model is done using the Finite Diﬀerence Iterative Potential-Field Solver
(FDIPS) code described by T´oth, van der Holst, and Huang (2011). This code is
freely available from the Center for Space Environment Modeling (CSEM) at the
University of Michigan (csem.engin.umich.edu/tools/FDIPS). It uses an iterative
ﬁnite-diﬀerence method to solve the Laplace equation for the magnetic ﬁeld. In
this particular case, the spatial resolution is 1◦ in longitude (360 longitudinal
grid points), 0.011 in the sine of latitude (180 latitudinal grid points) and 0.01
R(cid:12) in the radial direction.

Figure 16 left panel shows the result of our modeling together with a set of ﬁeld
lines computed starting integration at a height of 150 Mm in both directions. The
integration points are located in AR 12740, its neighborhood, and the trailing
AR 12741. It is clear that the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration remains closed at the
large scale, with closed lines connecting the leading and following AR polarities
and also the leading negative polarity to quiet-Sun regions located far to the
north of the AR. Figure 16 right panel shows an AIA 171 full disk image as
reference, the large scale loops connecting both AR 12740 polarities are clearly
seen.

We have computed the magnetic tension force or magnetic tension, B·∇B/µ0,
with B the three components of the magnetic ﬁeld directly derived from the
PFSS model and µ0 the vacuum magnetic permeability), at diﬀerent heights
(Fig. 17). The magnetic tension is directed towards the centre of curvature of
the ﬁeld lines and acts as a restoring force which works against the ejected
magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 17a shows the HMI synoptic map for CR 2217 which
helps us identify the locations of AR 12740 and the trailing AR 12741. Figure 17b

shows that the magnetic tension force is the largest over both ARs compared to
the surrounding. This is so over a broad interval of heights (at least up to 500
Mm), while the prominence stays conﬁned lower down (Fig. 8). We also compute
the magnetic tension force along the prominence trajectory, approximated by a
straight line inclined to the local vertical as observed by STEREO A (Fig. 8).
Figure 17c shows the results for the trajectory located within three meridional
planes. While the magnetic tension decreases fast along the trajectory, it still
stays large compared to the surroundings (panel b). Notice that we have also

SOLA: FailedFilamentRev.tex; 2 June 2022; 0:39; p. 24

Multi-Ribbon Flare and Failed Filament Eruption

added two curves computed in a similar way, but at both sides (east and west) of
ARs 12741 and 12740, to stress the diﬀerence between the values of the tension
in the surroundings to those in the AR where our events occurred. This lets
us conclude that it is the magnetic tension of the overlaying ﬁeld that prevents
the ﬁlament conﬁguration to erupt (see references in Sect. 1). Despite the fact
that the magnetic tension can be decreased by forced reconnection between the
erupting magnetic ﬁeld and the overlying arcade, the later has enough magnetic
ﬂux and intensity to stop the ﬁlament eruption at a moderate height.

5. Summary and Conclusions

We analyse a series of events that occurred in AR 12740 on 9 May 2019 using
a set of multiwavelength observations going from the photosphere to the corona
obtained by HMI, AIA, STEREO, IRIS, and GONG/LSO instruments. The
chain of events includes the formation of a ﬁlament, its destabilization and the
accompanying ﬂare, followed by the ﬁlament failed eruption. Our study lets us
conclude on the origin of each of the diﬀerent steps in this chain.

AR 12740 was in its decaying phase characterized by the presence of MMFs
surrounding a compact and high-intensity ﬁeld negative leading polarity followed
by a very disperse positive one. Though the AR could be globally considered as
bipolar, the constant advection of minor polarities from the main spot into the
surrounding moat region and the emergence of small bipoles created a very
complex and dynamic magnetic conﬁguration. A detailed study of the magnetic
ﬁeld evolution leads us to identify four main polarities that played a key role
during the ﬁlament eruption and ﬂare, i.e. these two events occurred within
a mainly quadrupolar AR (see Sect. 3.1). Magnetic ﬂux cancellation within the
moat region to the north of the main spot, in a site that we called a (see Sects. 3.1
and 3.2), was the origin of the formation of a long and curved ﬁlament by recon-
nection between sets of ﬁbrils, like in the model proposed by van Ballegooijen
and Martens (1989) (see an observed example in Schmieder et al., 2004).

In a similar manner, magnetic ﬂux cancellation was at the origin of the
destabilization of the ﬂux rope containing the ﬁlament plasma (see Sects. 3.1
and 3.4). This mechanism was proposed in several examples and simulations
of miniﬁlament eruptions followed by blow-out jets (see reference in Sect. 1).
The ﬂux cancellation process was mainly due to the constant shuﬄing of the
MMFs at two diﬀerent sites (sites b and c) by the PIL around the main spot.
This eruption was accompanied by a two-ribbon ﬂare whose main ribbons were
located on the main negative polarity and an L-shape positive polarity to its NE
(see Sect. 3.3). However, because the global magnetic conﬁguration of AR 12740
was quadrupolar, two additional ribbons were seen far to the east and west of the
two-ribbon ﬂare. A force-free magnetic ﬁeld model at the AR scale size allows us
connecting the far ﬂare ribbons between themselves and to the extensions of the
two main ﬂare ribbons, i.e. the ﬂare was in fact a six-ribbon event conﬁned by
the larger scale loops of the quadrupolar conﬁguration (see Sects. 4.2 and 4.3).
Even though the ﬂux rope containing the ﬁlament erupted, this eruption failed
thus plasma was observed ﬁrst moving upwards and later downwards. Based on

SOLA: FailedFilamentRev.tex; 2 June 2022; 0:39; p. 25

Joshi et al.

our local magnetic ﬁeld model, we propose a scenario (see Sect. 4.3) in which
the failed eruption and multi-ribbon ﬂare are the result of two reconnection
processes, one occurring below the erupting ﬂux rope, leading to the two-ribbon
ﬂare, and another one above it between the ﬁlament conﬁguration and the large-
scale closed loops of the quadrupolar conﬁguration. This second process leads to
the appearance of the far ﬂare ribbons and their counterparts (as extensions of
the main two ribbons). In a similar way, it injects plasma from the ﬁlament and
the loops where it is embedded, within the reconnected loops linking the ribbons
of the quadrupolar conﬁguration. These two reconnection processes have been
called internal and external in articles describing miniﬁlament eruptions (see
e.g. Sterling et al., 2015; Moore, Sterling, and Panesar, 2018, and references
therein). Furthermore via this external reconnection process, the erupting ﬂux
rope could fully reconnect with the large-scale closed loops because, as we have
shown, its magnetic ﬂux is much lower. A PFSS model conﬁrms that AR 12740
was conﬁned by closed ﬁeld lines connecting both AR main polarities and the
main negative polarity to quiet-Sun regions. Additionally, from this model we
compute the magnetic tension of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld at a height above
that one reached by the erupting plasma and conclude that above the AR it was
much larger than in other locations on the Sun (see Sect. 4.4). Therefore, from
the point of view of the global magnetic conﬁguration, we also ﬁnd hints that
would lead to a failed ﬁlament eruption.

Summarizing, from an observational point of view, this case study is clearly
consistent with models proposing that ﬁlaments can be formed from converging
ﬁbrils at ﬂux cancellations sites, as well as destabilized by similar ﬂux cancel-
lation processes (see references in Sect. 1). Furthermore, it represents a well
observed example of how magnetic conﬁnement by an intense overlying ﬁeld can
lead to failed ﬂux rope eruptions, as proposed by several MHD simulations (e.g.
Fan and Gibson, 2003; Amari et al., 2018).

Appendix

Study of the CME visible by STEREO-A COR1

For completeness, we analyse a CME whose leading edge appears in the STEREO-
A COR1 FOV at 05:55 UT, which we brieﬂy describe here. We also refer
the reader to the movies that can be generated at cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/stereo/
daily movies/ for a quick look of the CME event. Its projected speed at the
central position angle as measured in COR1-A images yields 246 km s−1. When
reaching the COR2-A FOV, the CME appears faint and diﬀuse, but is nonethe-
less detected by the Solar Eruption Detection System (SEEDS, spaceweather.
gmu.edu/seeds/monthly.php?a=2019&b=05&cor2) at George Mason University.
In this data base, the CME position angle is 260◦, i.e. 10◦ south from the solar
equator, and its speed in the plane-of-the-sky is 233 km s−1, in good agreement
with the value we compute from COR1-A images.

Although it is out of the scope of our work, we attempted –unsuccessfully–
to identify the CME source region in AIA images, as well as in the Hα ones

Multi-Ribbon Flare and Failed Filament Eruption

from LSO. Further inspection, now from the quadrature vantage point provided
by STEREO-A, shows coronal material at a fairly high altitude (∼ 1.4 R(cid:12)) and
at a position angle of ≈ 285◦, that starts moving outward in a radial fashion,
apparently destabilized and triggered by the ﬂare we study. Given this scenario,
we speculate that we are dealing with a stealth event, originating due to the
destabilization of a barely visible structure which lies at a signiﬁcant height
above the solar surface, already prior to the start of the C6.7 ﬂare. Being this
CME eruption magnetically connected to the failed eruption or not, both can be
regarded as separate events due to a number of reasons. Firstly, and as mentioned
above and shown in Fig. 8, the failed eruption moves with an angle of ≈ 60◦ with
respect to the radial direction, whilst the outward-travelling coronal material
seen at a high altitude propagates nearly radially. Secondly, the failed ﬁlament
eruption is seen to turn back at ∼06:30 UT, while the CME at that time is at
≈ 3 R(cid:12) and reaches the COR2-A FOV at 06:54 UT. Therefore, because of timing
and propagation direction, compared to that of the ﬁlament failed eruption seen
in EUVI-A images, we conclude that the CME observed in COR1-A and COR2-A
can be regarded as not aﬀecting the events analysed in this article.
