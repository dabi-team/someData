Abstract Solar eruptive events, like ﬂares and coronal mass ejections, are characterized by

the rapid release of energy that can give rise to emission of radiation across the entire elec-

tromagnetic spectrum and to an abrupt signiﬁcant increase in the kinetic energy of particles.

These energetic phenomena can have important effects on the Space Weather conditions and

therefore it is necessary to understand their origin, in particular, what is the eruptive potential

of an active region (AR). In these case studies, we compare two distinct methods that were

used in previous works to investigate the variations of some characteristic physical parameters

during the pre-ﬂare states of ﬂaring ARs. These methods consider: i) the magnetic ﬂux evolu-

tion and the magnetic helicity accumulation, and ii) the fractal and multi-fractal properties of

ﬂux concentrations in ARs. Our comparative analysis is based on time series of photospheric

data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory between March 2011 and June 2013. We

selected two distinct samples of ARs: one is distinguished by the occurrence of more ener-

getic M- and X-class ﬂare events, that may have a rapid effect on not just the near-Earth space,

but also on the terrestrial environment; the second is characterized by no-ﬂares or having just

few C- and B-class ﬂares. We found that the two tested methods complement each other in

their ability to assess the eruptive potentials of ARs and could be employed to identify ARs

prone to ﬂaring activity. Based on the presented case study, we suggest that using a combi-

nation of different methods may aid to identify more reliably the eruptive potentials of ARs

and help to better understand the pre-ﬂare states.

1 INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares occur in and around active regions (ARs) when magnetic energy, which has built up in regions

of the solar atmosphere, is suddenly released by magnetic reconnection processes. These processes can also

drive solar plasma into the heliosphere by giving rise to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that often occur

concurrently with ﬂares (see, e.g., Priest & Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara 2011, and references therein).

Observations collected over many years have shown that key aspects of evolution leading to eruptive events

in ARs are the size and topology of the magnetic region (see, e.g., Romano et al. 2014, 2019), the non-

potential component of the magnetic ﬁeld in the AR, the occurrence of destabilization conditions, and the

associated energies (for a review, see, e.g., Benz 2017).

Prediction of solar eruptive events, such as ﬂares and CMEs, has recently evolved from a tool to test our

understanding of the processes leading the evolution of solar magnetic regions into a societal need to both

prevent and mitigate the potentials of damage to modern technologies due to Space Weather events (see,

e.g., Bonadonna et al. 2017; Mann et al. 2018; Bingham et al. 2019; Opgenoorth et al. 2019; Plainaki et al.

2020, and references therein). Therefore, the literature is rich in ﬂare-prediction methods applied to a wide

range of observations of ARs (see, e.g. McCloskey et al. 2018; Leka et al. 2018; Campi et al. 2019; Falco

et al. 2019; Goodman et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020), as well as a number of studies devoted to the comparison

between different prediction methods (see, e.g., Barnes et al. 2016; Leka et al. 2019a,b; Park et al. 2020,

and references therein).

In this work, our aim is to exploit the diverse information obtained by two individual methods on the pre-

ﬂare conditions, which could be useful and practical for a future operational service to assess the eruptive

potentials of an AR.

First technique – Magnetic ﬂux and magnetic helicity trend

The ﬁrst technique employs methods that analyze the magnetic ﬂux (Φ) and magnetic helicity (H) of ARs

(Smyrli et al. 2010). They assume that the excess energy with respect to the potential ﬁeld is injected into

the source region of a ﬂare by its Poynting ﬂux:

P = (c/4π)

(cid:90)

( (cid:126)E × (cid:126)B) dS,

where the electric vector E is expressed by Ohm’s law:

(cid:126)E = −(1/c) (cid:126)v × (cid:126)B

(1)

(2)

and c, v, and B indicate the speed of electromagnetic radiation in the vacuum, the plasma velocity, and the

magnetic ﬁeld vector, respectively. Helicity injection can occur by the emergence of new magnetic ﬂux and

by the presence of a signiﬁcant velocity component (vt) perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. Kusano et al.

Comparison of two methods to assess ARs eruptive potential

(2002) described a method for the determination of the tangential velocity ﬁeld vt to estimate the injected

energy, while Schrijver et al. (2005) argued that the helicity carried by the emerging ﬁeld has a stronger

impact than the ﬁeld shearing at the surface (Li et al. 2000).

By comparing the energy and helicity budgets of quiet- and ﬂare-productive ARs, Georgoulis & Rust

(2007) concluded that the estimated free energy and the helicity are both reliable quantities for their dis-

tinction. LaBonte et al. (2007) found that a sufﬁcient helicity injection rate for an X-class ﬂare to occur is

at least 6 · 1036 Mx2 s−1, where this threshold was proposed as a necessary dynamical condition for ﬂare

eruption. Therefore helicity injection rate may be an excellent ﬂare-risk signature. Considering dynamical

properties in connection with halo CMEs, Smyrli et al. (2010) examined the temporal variation of the helic-

ity ﬂux in a sample of ARs. They found that no typical pre-CME behavioural pattern can be identiﬁed, but

in some cases the post-CME state showed that a signiﬁcant amount of helicity had indeed been carried away

during such events. More recently, Elmhamdi et al. (2014) reported characteristic ﬂare-related patterns of

the AR tilt angle variation, which is another property related to helicity.

Second technique – Fractal and multi-fractal parameters

The second technique focuses on the morphology of ﬂux concentrations in ARs, in particular on the level

of intermittency in surface magnetic ﬁeld patterns (Ermolli et al. 2014). High level of intermittency means

strong tangential discontinuities in the magnetic ﬁeld, which may initiate reconnection events. Abramenko

et al. (2003) introduced a number of parameters to describe the structural complexity of magnetic regions

and they found characteristic patterns in the pre-ﬂare behaviour, but only on a time scale of a few tens

of minutes prior the ﬂaring events. The parameters inferred from photospheric magnetograms reported in

Abramenko et al. (2003) were evaluated by considering variations of the structure function for ARs; the

results obtained indicate the enhancement of plasma turbulence in connection with the ﬂares.

Following Abramenko et al. (2003), multiple studies have reported distinct values of the fractal and

multi-fractal parameters measured for ARs with different ﬂare-classes (see, e.g. McAteer et al. 2005;

Georgoulis 2012). However, such measurements are not very efﬁcient for distinguishing ARs with ﬂare

activity, because the large measured dispersion values of an AR could produce the same class ﬂare events.

Further investigating the sensitivity of fractal and multifractal measurements on ﬂare activity of ARs,

Ermolli et al. (2014) showed that the dispersion of results and temporal evolution of measured values are

all affected by the spatial resolution and cadence of the analyzed observations. In particular, the analy-

sis of data from the Solar Dynamic Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI, Scherrer

et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012; Wachter et al. 2012) with a higher resolution produced less noisy results

than those obtained from the relatively low resolution of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson

Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI, Scherrer et al. 1995) data, employed largely in earlier studies. Giorgi et al.

(2015) reported that measurements of fractal and multifractal parameters carried out on a large sample

of SDO/HMI observations, which are the highest-resolution full-disk synoptic magnetograms available to

date, allow distinguishing ARs that host more energetic events from relatively ﬂare-quiet ARs. Nevertheless,

these measurements do not allow us to distinguish between the C- and M-class ﬂaring ARs, nor between

the M- and X-class ARs. Furthermore, Giorgi et al. (2015) reported consistent changes on the time series

Paper organization

In Sections 2 and 3, we describe the data set of ﬁve ﬂare-productive and ﬁve ﬂare-quiet ARs and the

applied methods in detail, respectively. In Section 4, we summarize the results obtained from the two applied

methods. Next, in Section 5, we discuss the obtained results and in Section 6 we give our conclusions.

2 DATA

We analyzed the time series of ten ARs observed between 2011 March 6 and 2013 Jun 24 by SDO/HMI.

We selected from the NOAA catalog the following regions: i) ﬁve ﬂare-productive ARs: 11166, 11283,

11429, 11515, 11520 and (ii) ﬁve ﬂare-quiet ARs: 11267, 11512, 11589, 11635 and 11775. All these ARs

had δ-spot(s).

The selected ﬂare-productive regions were cradles of M- and X-class ﬂares during their passage over

the solar disk, with peak soft X-ray ﬂux greater than or equal to 10−5 W m−2 as reported in the soft X-ray

(SXR) ﬂux catalog of the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES), available at the NOAA

Space Weather Prediction Center1. The selected ﬁve ﬂare-quiet ARs hosted only very low energetic B- and

C-class ﬂares with 10−7-10−6 W m−2 peak in the soft X-ray ﬂux.

For each selected AR, we analyzed time series of Level 1.5 SDO/HMI full-disk photospheric LOS

magnetograms. The time interval of the analyzed data series was chosen in such a way that each AR was

within ≈ ±30◦ from the central meridian, in order to avoid signiﬁcant uncertainties due to projection

effects. All the magnetogram data were corrected for the angle between the magnetic ﬁeld direction and the

observer’s LOS (Wood & Martens 2003) and were co-aligned by applying the standard differential rotation

rate reported by Howard et al. (1990).

We extracted sub-arrays centered on the selected ARs from the SDO/HMI full-disk observations. The

data set restricted to the time interval with the AR position within ≈ ±30◦ from the central meridian consist

of LOS magnetograms, each of 4096 ×4096 pixels, with a pixel size of 0.505 arcsec and cadence from 12

to 96 minutes. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the details of the analyzed regions, the time interval considered

for each AR and the dimension of the analyzed sub-arrays.

3 METHODS

3.1 Magnetic ﬂux and magnetic helicity trend

This method is based on the analysis of the magnetic ﬂux (Φ) and magnetic helicity (H) of ARs (Smyrli

et al. 2010). Considering SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms with the subﬁeld (centered on each AR) speciﬁed

in the last column of Tables 1 and 2, we measured the evolution of the positive (Φ+), negative (Φ−),

and unsigned (Φ) magnetic ﬂuxes. We estimated the uncertainty of the magnetic ﬂux by propagating the

experimental errors and considering the SDO/HMI sensitivity of 10 G (Schou et al. 2012).

The magnetic helicity ﬂux values were determined by the mean magnetograms corresponding to the av-

erage between two sequential ones in the analyzed series. We, then, measured the horizontal velocity ﬁelds

by means of the Differential Afﬁne Velocity Estimator technique (DAVE, Schuck 2005, 2006), by using a

full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the apodizing window of 11 pixels (5.5 arcsec), as suggested by

Schuck (2008).

The rate of change of the magnetic helicity ﬂux dH/dt was estimated using the following equation (see

Pariat et al. 2005):

dH
dt

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

S

S(cid:48)

dθ(r)

BnB(cid:48)

ndSdS(cid:48),

(3)

where S = S(cid:48) is the integration surface, dθ(r)/dt is the relative rotation rate of pairs of photospheric posi-
tions deﬁned by x and x(cid:48), where the condition (cid:126)r = (cid:126)x − (cid:126)x(cid:48) holds. Moreover, Bn indicates the component of

the magnetic ﬁeld normal to the surface S.

Once the magnetic helicity ﬂux is obtained, we could estimate the corresponding accumulation of mag-

netic helicity (H) for the selected ARs, using the equation:

H =

(cid:90) ∆t

0

dH
dt

dt,

(4)

where ∆t indicates the total observational time interval for each AR.

As far as the calculation of H is concerned, it is important to stress that helicity is a signed quantity,

resulting from the algebraic sum of right-handed (conventionally positive) and left-handed (conventionally

negative) values. This means that a helicity increase could be related to an increasing dominance of one of

the two signs, because the injection of the prevailing sign becomes stronger, or the injection of the deﬁcient

sign becomes weaker, or both, along with conceivable combinations. Conversely, a helicity decrease could

be related to a weakening injection of the prevailing sign, a strengthening injection of the deﬁcient sign, or

6

Zuccarello et al.

both, along with combinations. Therefore, in order to investigate the contribution of the right-handed (in the

following indicated as H +) and left-handed (H −) helicity, we have also taken into account the contributions

of these quantities separately.

3.2 Fractal and multi-fractal parameters

This method is based on the study of the level of intermittency in surface magnetic ﬁeld patterns (Ermolli

et al. 2014). We estimated the generalized fractal dimensions D0 and D8 and the multifractal Contribution

Diversity Cdiv and Dimensional Diversity Ddiv on each subarray extracted from the SDO/HMI LOS mag-

netograms series considered in our study. We recall that these measures describe self-similar properties of

the solar magnetic ﬁeld, which are a signature of the turbulent physical processes that govern the evolution

of the solar magnetic regions from the interplay between plasma ﬂows and magnetic ﬁeld. We derived D0,

D8, Cdiv, and Ddiv following previous studies in the literature by, e.g., McAteer et al. (2005), Criscuoli

et al. (2009), Georgoulis (2012), and Ermolli et al. (2014). We analysed D0 and D8, as in previous studies,

because they are less sensitive to pixel scale and pixelization (Lawrence et al. 1996). The theory behind the

computed quantities, as well as the accuracy of the methods and algorithms employed on solar data, are

extensively described in, e.g., Abramenko et al. (2003), Abramenko (2005), Sen (2007), and in the above

papers. However, we summarize here the main characteristics of the methods applied in this study in what

follows.

Given a measure of an observable P , the Generalized Fractal Dimension is deﬁned as:

where q is a real number,

Dq =

Pi((cid:15))q,

(6)

and we have introduced the more compact notation: N(cid:15) instead of N ((cid:15)). In our study, Pi((cid:15)) is the normalized

magnetic ﬂux Pi((cid:15)) =

|(cid:80)

j Φj|
Φtot

, where j is the image pixel that runs in a box of size (cid:15), Φj is the magnetic

ﬂux at image pixel j, and Φtot is the magnetic ﬂux in the image. We analyzed the temporal variation of the

generalized dimension D0 and D8, where, according to Equation (5):

D0 = − lim

α represents the density of the quantity analysed in the study, here normalized magnetic ﬂux, F(α) is the

fractal dimension of the points of the domain with the same value of α. Following Conlon et al. (2008), the

Cdiv and Ddiv considered in our study are deﬁned as:

Cdiv = (αq)max − (αq)min ; Ddiv = F (αq)max − F (αq)min

(12)

respectively. These measures are a signature of the turbulent processes involving plasma ﬂows and magnetic

ﬁeld in and around solar magnetic regions, as recalled above. Following Conlon et al. (2008), we restricted

our analysis to q > 0, since numerical errors are larger for negative values of the exponent q.

We inferred the above fractal and multifractal parameters by using the box-counting technique

(Mandelbrot 1983), which is usually employed for fractal and multifractal analysis (see, e.g., Evertsz &

Mandelbrot 1992). The method consists of covering the image of the analysed region with boxes of differ-

ent sizes (cid:15) and then estimating the slope of the linear relation:

where N ((cid:15)) is the number of boxes that cover the studied region, C is a constant and D is the fractal

ln N ((cid:15)) = D lim

dimension.

For each analysed sub-array, we computed D0, D8, Cdiv, and Ddiv and then investigated their variation

with respect to the evolution of the AR. We take into account the results derived from the unsigned and

signed ﬂux measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld in the data.

Next, for each sub-array, we evaluated the above parameters on the set of pixels characterized by a LOS

magnetic ﬂux larger than ± 25 G that is ≈ ±3 times the standard deviation of quiet Sun magnetic ﬂux

distribution on the sub-array. We derived D0 and D8 from the least-squares best ﬁt of the scaling relation of

Equation (8), and Cdiv, and Ddiv from Equations (9) and (12). The uncertainty associated with the measured

values was assumed to be equal to the 2-sigma uncertainty for the parameters returned by the regression ﬁt

of Equation (8) and from error propagation.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Magnetic ﬂux and magnetic helicity

4.1.1 Flare-productive ARs

Figure 1 (left panels) shows the evolution of the positive-polarity (Φ+), negative-polarity (Φ−), and un-

signed (Φ) magnetic ﬂux measured using the time series of each analyzed ﬂare-productive AR. The panels

in the middle column of Figure 1 display the magnetic helicity accumulation H in the studied ARs. The

positive (right-handed) H + and the absolute value of the negative (left-handed) H − helicity accumulation

are reported in the right panels of Figure 1. We plot the measured ﬂuxes with their corresponding error bars

that were derived as outlined in Sect. 3. Vertical lines in each plot denote the time of occurrence of M- (red),

and X- (green) class ﬂares; when the ﬂare was associated with a CME, the thickness of the vertical line is

enhanced.

In the following, we summarize the main ﬁndings derived from the analysis of Fig. 1, concerning the

evolution of Φ, H, H + and H − for each ﬂaring AR.

8

Zuccarello et al.

– AR 11166: the magnetic ﬂux increases during the entire analyzed time interval. Φ+ and Φ− are quite

balanced (initially Φ+ is slightly higher, but after ∼ 62 hr the situation is reversed). The accumulated

magnetic helicity is positive and shows a persistent increase from the beginning and during all the

selected time interval; there is not any measured change after the M-class ﬂare associated with the

CME. The situation is similar after the X-class ﬂare. We only report a ﬂattening of the H trend after the

second M-class ﬂare, followed by a new increase after the third M-class ﬂare. Both the right- and the

left-handed helicity show a persistent increase, even if H + shows a more signiﬁcant increase during the

analyzed time interval. It is worthwhile to note that, taking into account that this AR was on the northern

hemisphere, it did not follow the general pattern cycle-invariant hemispheric helicity rule (Seehafer

1990; Pevtsov et al. 1995).

– AR 11283: after an initial rising phase, Φ− is almost constant, while Φ+ decreases during the investi-

gated time interval. The positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes show an imbalance, with a higher Φ−,

increasing in time. The values of H are lower than for AR 11166 (see Table 3) and this property might

be related to the fact that the magnetic ﬂux in AR 11166 was generally increasing, while in this AR it

is characterized by lower values and it is decreasing. Similarly to AR 11166, both the right- and left-

handed helicity show a persistent increase, with the H + exhibiting a more signiﬁcant increase during

the analyzed time interval. Finally, we note that, also in this case, the AR did not follow the hemispheric

helicity rule. For more details about the behaviour of helicity in this AR, see, e.g., Romano et al. (2015).

– AR 11429: Φ− decreases during the studied time interval, while Φ+, after an initial increase, remains

almost constant. There is a ﬂux imbalance such that Φ− ∼ 1.66 Φ+, at the beginning, but the imbalance

decreases with time. The magnetic helicity, characterized by negative values, shows a very rapid increase

until the X-class ﬂare, that is associated with a CME, takes place. For almost 50 hr later, H shows an

alternation between positive and negative values and, after an M-class ﬂare associated with a follow-

up CME, there is a steeper increase of negative H accumulation. The right- and left-handed helicity

accumulation have similar values and increasing trend till the occurrence of the M-class ﬂare associated

with the CME, and later on H − increases more rapidly than H +. Interestingly, this AR did not follow

the Hale Law: in fact, even though being on the northern hemisphere, its leading polarity was positive,

appearing as a possible rogue AR (see, e.g., Nagy et al. 2017). However, taking into account that the H

sign is negative, the AR followed the helicity hemispheric rule (see, e.g., Elmhamdi et al. 2014, for a

more elaborated analysis of this AR).

– AR 11515: Φ− is almost constant during the analysed time interval, while Φ+ increases continuously.

Initially, Φ− > Φ+, but after an elapsed time of t = 42 hr the situation is reversed. It is worth noting

that at this time an M-class ﬂare occurred with a CME and that the slope of the magnetic helicity

accumulation changes, as described in the following. The accumulated magnetic helicity of this AR

remains close to zero for the ﬁrst ∼ 8 hr (note that during the same time interval the magnetic ﬂux

also remains constant). Next, H starts to increase (with negative values) and shows a phase of ﬂattening

few hr before the second M-class ﬂare with a CME. Later on, H increases again, without any clear

variation signature after three M-class ﬂares, which occurred between t = 75 hr and t = 82 hr. The

analysis of the right- and left-handed H shows that both are characterized by a continuous increase,

with H − showing a more signiﬁcant increase during the analyzed time interval. This AR did not follow

the helicity hemispheric rule.

– AR 11520: Φ− decreases continuously, while Φ+ is almost constant. Initially Φ− > Φ+, but at time t

=55 hr, the situation is reversed. Note that the time of reversal occurs when H changes its trend (from

increasing to decreasing). In fact, H increases very rapidly until a maximum value of 8 · 1042 Mx2 is

reached. H is almost ﬂat for ∼ 2 hr and then an X-class ﬂare with a CME, takes place. Immediately

before and after this event, the trend of H changes as it starts to decrease. Both the right- and the left-

handed helicity show a continuous increase, but it is possible to distinguish an almost specular change

in the trend of the relevant curves after the occurrence of the X-class ﬂare. The occurrence of an M-class

ﬂare associated with the CME at time t = 93 hr does not seem to be related to any changes in the trend

of H. This AR followed the helicity hemispheric rule.

Table 3 summarizes the results of our measurements of the magnetic ﬂux and helicity accumulation for

the ﬁve analyzed ﬂaring ARs.

4.1.2 Flare-quiet ARs

In the following, we summarize the results derived from the analysis of Fig. 2, showing the evolution of Φ

and H, as well as the behaviour of the left-handed and right-handed helicity accumulation for each ﬂare-

quiet AR.

– AR 11267: the magnetic ﬂux shows a general decreasing trend during the analyzed time interval.

However, while Φ+ is smoothly decreasing, Φ− shows after about 10 hr from the beginning of the

analyzed interval, an increasing phase, which later becomes constant and then decreases. The accumu-

lated magnetic helicity is negative and shows a continuous increase from the beginning till ∼ 50 hr,

when it starts to show an opposite (i.e., decreasing) behaviour. Both left-handed and right-handed H

10

Zuccarello et al.

show a persistent increase, but while the increase of H + is constant, the increase of H − is steeper dur-

ing the ﬁrst ∼ 50 hr and smoother in the remaining time interval. This AR did not follow the helicity

hemispheric rule. Another analysis of the helicity for this AR can be found in Guglielmino et al. (2016).

– AR 11512: the total magnetic ﬂux is characterized by a decreasing trend during the analyzed time

interval. This behaviour is mainly due to the decreasing Φ−, while Φ+ remains constant during the

analyzed interval. The accumulated magnetic helicity is negative and shows a persistent increase (with

different steepness) from the beginning till ∼ 60 hr, when it starts to show an opposite (i.e., decreasing)

behaviour, followed after about 10 hr by a new increase. Both left-handed and right-handed H show

a persistent increase, but similarly to AR 11267, even if less evident, the increase of H + is constant,

while the increase of H − is steeper during the ﬁrst ∼ 60 hr and smoother in the remaining time interval.

Like AR 11267, this AR did not follow the helicity hemispheric rule.

– AR 11589: the magnetic ﬂux shows a decreasing trend during the analyzed time interval. This is more

evident in the Φ+ and less in the Φ−. The accumulated magnetic helicity is characterized by nega-

tive values and shows a continuous increase from the beginning till ∼ 80 hr, when it becomes almost

constant. The left- and right-handed H are both linearly increasing during the analyzed time interval.

– AR 11635: the magnetic ﬂux shows an alternate behaviour: initially decreasing, then increasing and

ﬁnally decreasing again. Φ− is always higher than Φ+. The accumulated magnetic helicity has positive

values and shows an increasing trend, initially quite smooth, but steeper after ∼ 30 hr. Successively,

we can notice a phase of constant value of H and ﬁnally a decrease. The right- and left-handed H,

both increasing with time, are characterized by an initial similar trend, but later on H − increases more

slowly. This AR did not follow the helicity hemispheric rule.

– AR 11775: the magnetic ﬂux (total and negative) shows a decreasing trend during the analyzed time

interval, while Φ+ is almost constant. The accumulated magnetic helicity has positive values and shows

a continuous and steep increase from the beginning till ∼ 30 hr, when it becomes almost constant. H −

is characterized by a linear increasing trend, while H + shows initially a similar trend, but after ∼ 30 hr

the increase is smoother.

Table 4 summarises the results of the magnetic ﬂux and helicity accumulation for the ﬁve analysed

ﬂare-quiet ARs.

From the comparison of the helicity accumulation trend between the ﬂare-producing and ﬂare-quiet

ARs, we can conclude that for the ﬁrst class of ARs H is generally characterised by a persistent accumu-

lation of higher magnitudes and senses of helicity, with the only exception of AR 11520. In this respect, it

should be noted that the change of the trend in this AR takes place in correspondence to the occurrence of

a CME: this behaviour has already been reported in previous studies (see, e.g. Smyrli et al. (2010)) and has

been interpreted as due to a process by which a signiﬁcant amount of helicity can be carried away during

the CME. Differently, the ﬂare-quiet ARs do not show a persistent accumulation of higher magnitudes and

senses of helicity: H can be initially increasing and later on decreasing (ARs 11267 and 11635), initially

increasing and later on (almost) constant (ARs 11512, 11589, and 11775).

Another element that seems to differentiate the two groups of ARs is related to the different values of

the right- and left-handed helicity accumulation, being about 3 - 4 times larger for the ﬂare-productive ARs

4.2 Fractal and multi-fractal properties

Figures 3 to 6 show the time series of the fractal and multifractal measurements on analyzed data. The error

associated with the measured values is equal to the 2-sigma uncertainty for the parameters (see Ermolli et al.

(2014) for more details). For the sake of clarity, this uncertainty is shown only for the results derived from

unsigned ﬂux data of the analyzed ARs. Vertical lines in each plot indicate the time of occurrence of M-

(red), and X- (green) class ﬂares; when the ﬂare was associated with a CME, the thickness of the vertical

line is enhanced.

Figures 3 to 6 show small differences among the values of the fractal and multifractal parameters mea-

sured on the various ARs, as well as among the evolution of the measured values.

This is conﬁrmed by the results summarized in Table 5, which lists the values of the parameters mea-

sured on each AR when considering unsigned ﬂux data. Table 5 also reports the ﬂaring level of the analyzed

ARs. We estimated this quantity by using the ﬂare index (FI, see Li et al. 2004), which accounts for the ﬂare

history of the region during its disk transit as depicted from the NOAA’s GOES X-ray archive. Table 5 also

lists the FI value of the most intense event hosted by each region (hereafter referred to as Max FI), and the

average and standard deviation of the values derived from the two classes of studied ARs for each measured

parameter.

In Table 5, the values conﬁrm previous published results on a signiﬁcant fractality of the morphology of

the magnetic ﬂux concentration in both ﬂare-productive and ﬂare-quiet ARs. Indeed, the fractal parameter

D0 derived from all the ARs ranges between ≈ 1.64 and ≈ 1.90. The values in Table 5 show that the

fractal and multifractal parameters of the ﬂare-productive and ﬂare-quiet regions can overlap, as already

reported by Giorgi et al. (2015). It is worth nothing that, although a thresholded warning method based on

measurements of fractal/multifractal parameters may result in some misclassiﬁcation of the ﬂare and ﬂare-

quiet classes, using these measures imply an automatic and robust analysis of observations that is suitable

for a quick initial taxonomy of new solar regions.

Figures 3 to 6 also display the evolution of the various analysed parameters when taking into account

the trailing and leading ﬂux data of the analysed AR. The various trends conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that there

is a systematic larger variance of the values derived from trailing ﬂux data in the ﬂaring ARs than obtained

from both unsigned and leading ﬂux data. From analyzing the series of the measured parameters, we notice

that several M- and X-class ﬂares occur during a decreasing phase of the Ddiv and an increasing phase of

the D8 values estimated by considering unsigned and signed ﬂux data of the leading polarity of the AR

hemisphere. However, these features of the parameter trends seem not to represent a consistent pre-ﬂare

signature in the whole sample of analyzed ﬂaring ARs and events.

Finally, we notice a clear resemblance between the trends of the fractal and multifractal parameters

shown in Figures 3 to 6 and those of the magnetic ﬂux displayed in Figures 1 to 2.

5 DISCUSSION

Comparisons that aimed to test the performances of different methods to assess the eruptive potential of

ARs presented in the literature in speciﬁc contexts did not reveal clear outstanding performances of one

method with respect to all others. Earlier ﬁndings by, e.g. Barnes & Leka (2008), Leka & Barnes (2013),

conﬁrmed by Barnes et al. (2016), reported outcomes of considerable efforts devoted by several teams to

test the ability of a number of methods on common data sets. In their study, Barnes et al. (2016) compared

results from 11 algorithms on 13,000 magnetograms relevant to ARs that have hosted more than 3000 events

during the period of 2000 to 2005, by applying standard veriﬁcation statistics to determine the ability of the

tested methods to identify ﬂare signatures and predict eruptive events. The different algorithms were applied

to sub-areas extracted from the full-disk line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld and continuum intensity images taken

close to noon of each studied day observed by SOHO/MDI. Barnes et al. (2016) showed that none among

the tested methods clearly outperforms all others, and partially attributed this result to the strong correlations

among the parameters used by the various methods to characterize the ARs. Furthermore, a workshop was

held at Nagoya University in 2017 to quantitatively compare the performance of several operational solar

ﬂare-prediction methods. This led to the studies described by Leka et al. (2019a,b) that present the compared

methods and evaluation methodology applied, and describe the results from quantitative comparisons and

method performance.

Taking into account the conclusions of Barnes et al. (2016) about the importance of combining the

application of statistical analysis to the characterization of ARs by some parameters that are able to assess

their eruptive potential, we used here two methods based on the study of the magnetic ﬂux and helicity

accumulation, and fractal and multifractal measurements. The detailed case study analysis was carried out

on ﬁve ﬂare-productive and ﬁve ﬂare-quiet ARs. The methods applied in our study are based on different

techniques. Following Smyrli et al. (2010) and Ermolli et al. (2014), the two methods were applied to LOS

magnetogram time series of ARs within ±30◦ from the central meridian, because the projection effects at

20

Zuccarello et al.

longitudes greater than ±30◦ strongly affect the determination of the relevant parameters. The two methods

have in common that they employ the signed ﬂux and the absolute value of the magnetic ﬂux.

Smyrli et al. (2010) demonstrated that magnetic helicity accumulation in the ARs generating halo CMEs

can exhibit signiﬁcant changes when there are indications of newly emerging magnetic ﬂux. The second

result of their paper is that for 4/5 of the studied ARs helicity accumulation is in agreement with the hemi-

spheric helicity rule (Seehafer 1990), but the remaining 1/5 part of the ARs, which produced impulsive

CMEs, do not follow the hemispheric helicity rule. In the ARs considered in our study, three out of ﬁve

of ﬂare-productive ARs do not show an agreement with the helicity rule, while two ARs do. Moreover,

the analysis of the helicity accumulation has shown two interesting results: the ﬁrst one is related to the

fact that ﬂare-productive ARs show a persistent accumulation of higher magnitudes and senses of helicity,

while the ﬂare-quiet ARs are characterized by changes in the H trend; the second result is related to lower

values of the right-handed and left-handed magnetic helicity accumulation in ﬂare-quiet ARs with respect

to ﬂare-productive ARs.

Ermolli et al. (2014) and Giorgi et al. (2015) investigated the temporal variation of the fractal and multi-

fractal parameters of the total unsigned and signed ﬂux of some ARs observed with the SDO/HMI. The

main results obtained from their study are reﬂected back in the currently analyzed AR cases. Several of

the solar ﬂare events of the ﬁve ﬂare-productive ARs occur during a decreasing phase of the Ddiv and,

concurrently, during an increasing phase of the D8 values. This result agrees with recent ﬁndings by Park

et al. (2020) on that the prior ﬂaring history of an AR is an important factor to consider in development of

robust ﬂare-prediction methods.

The common feature of the two compared methods is that they take into account the unsigned magnetic

ﬂux in their measurements. The variation of the D8 parameter (Ermolli et al. 2014) conﬁrms the behavior

of the positive/negative and unsigned ﬂux in time, already investigated by Smyrli et al. (2010), in all the ﬁve

ﬂare-productive ARs analyzed in our study. We unveil an interesting common property in the two compared

techniques: there is a prominent role of the decreasing phase of certain parameters. Ermolli et al. (2014)

found that several solar ﬂare events occur during a decrease of Ddiv. There is an interesting aspect in the

magnetic ﬂux and helicity accumulation investigation, i.e., that strong energetic ﬂares (mainly X-class) with

CMEs (see, e.g., Fig. 1, left panel, ﬁrst, second and ﬁfth rows) occur on the constant or decreasing evolution

part of the unsigned magnetic ﬂux, while a ﬂare without CME appears anywhere as part of the temporal

variation of the unsigned magnetic ﬂux.

Our study aimed at exploiting the diverse information carried out by the individual methods on the pre-

ﬂare conditions. These comparative examinations necessarily differ from the studies on large samples. In

their pioneering study, Bobra & Couvidat (2015) examined 25 parameters deduced from vector magnetic

maps of 2701 ARs and carried out true skill score analysis. The large size of the material obviously cannot

allow scrutinizing the details of the pre-ﬂare evolution, as they necessarily consider the individual cases like

snapshots. In contrast, the present approach on a more limited sample allows us to compare the details of

the pre-ﬂare status and dynamics for the analyzed ARs.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The large interest in the identiﬁcation of physical parameters that carry information on the peak magnitudes

and timescales of solar eruptive events has motivated many theoretical and observational studies of ﬂaring

ARs; see, e.g., recent works by Shibata & Magara (2011), Harra et al. (2016) and Toriumi et al. (2017),

and references therein. Besides, the need to reﬁne our knowledge about the physical processes behind solar

eruptive events and to mitigate their effects in the circumterrestrial environment has driven the development

of several methods useful to assess the eruptive potential of ARs based on full-disk observations of the ARs

emerged into the solar atmosphere.

In this case study, here, we applied two different algorithms based on as many methods to assess the

eruptive potential of ARs previously presented by Smyrli et al. (2010), and Ermolli et al. (2014) on time

series of SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms observations, i.e., present-day highest resolution full-disk photo-

spheric data. Based on the prediction capability of the two methods (see the summary Table 6), we could

conclude that the employed methods seem to complement each other in their ability to identify ﬂaring ARs.

By identifying suitable general characteristics of the AR, the methods based on helicity and fractal mea-

surements allow discriminating regions that may host extreme class events right after their appearance on

the solar disk, based on the reported differences between the average values of the parameters measured

in the ﬂare-quiet and ﬂaring ARs. Therefore, the two methods tested in our study could be employed as

warning tools to identity ARs prone to ﬂaring activity by following the emergence of any magnetic region

in the solar photosphere.

In order to describe how the two methods could be employed to identify ARs prone to ﬂaring activity,

the Fig.7 was obtained by taking into account the relationship between the ﬂare index FI and two parameters

(left- or right- handed magnetic helicity H and fractal parameter Ddiv), used in the analysis relevant to the

ﬁrst and the second method, respectively.

More precisely, as far as the ﬁrst method is concerned, one of the results that we obtained was related to

higher values of the left- or right- handed magnetic helicity in the ﬂare-productive ARs with respect to the

ones relevant to ﬂare-quiet ARs. Therefore, we estimated, for each AR, the maximum value reached by the

left- or right- handed magnetic helicity during the analyzed time interval and reported its absolute value as

a function of the FI for the respective AR, as shown in the plot reported in Fig. 7. The results, indicated by

the squares (red for the ﬂare-productive ARs and light blue for the ﬂare-quiet ARs) show that there are two

classes, grouped in two different and well distinguished regions of the plot: pink and light blue color areas

for ﬂare-productive ARs and yellow area for the ﬂare-quiet AR.

Similarly, the average value of the Ddiv parameter obtained with the second method, is reported, for

each AR as a function of the FI (green stars for the ﬂare-productive ARs and blue stars for the ﬂare-quiet

ARs) in Fig. 7. In this case, we can see that the data-points are located in two different regions of the plot:

light blue color area for ﬂare-productive ARs and yellow plus green areas for the ﬂare-quiet ARs.

Therefore, using a combination of these two methods, it should be possible to provide a quantitative

estimation of the eruptive potential of an AR. Indeed, while the second method is particularly efﬁcient

in identifying productive ARs, the ﬁrst one allows recognizing quiet regions very accurately. Thus, the

suggested procedure could be the following: starting from the determination of the Ddiv parameter, once

22

helicity and the Ddiv parameter as a function of FI. The horizontal axis at the bottom reports the absolute

value of the right- or left-handed magnetic helicity (in units of 1042 Mx2) for the analyzed ARs; the top

horizontal axis reports Ddiv values, while the vertical axis reports the FI. Red (light blue) squares indicate

the absolute value of the right- or left-handed magnetic helicity for the ﬂare-productive (ﬂare-quiet) ARs;

green (blue) stars indicate the Ddiv parameter value for the ﬂare-productive (ﬂare-quiet) ARs.

this overcomes a certain value, which, based on the present analysis, we can set equal to ∼ 0.69, if the

absolute value of the left- or right- handed magnetic helicity is greater than 20 × 1042 Max and the FI

becomes greater than ∼ 50, then the analyzed AR could be considered prone to ﬂaring. More speciﬁcally,

the plot quadrant which should be taken into account for this estimate is the one highlighted with the light

blue color in Fig. 7.

It is worth noting that none of the operational ﬂare-prediction methods present in the literature are able to

adequately respond to changes in ﬂaring activity (Park et al. 2020). This shows that we need to speciﬁcally

improve the performance of ﬂare-prediction methods over short-term variations in ﬂare activity. Therefore,

reﬁning the capabilities of existing ﬂare-prediction methods and deepening our knowledge of the physics

behind the quantities that allow a more successful assessment of the eruptive potential of ARs be determined

is important for solar and Space Weather research. In this respect, our next intention is to apply these two

methods on a much bigger statistical sample, in order to extend our results. Moreover, we plan to investigate

the potential of other parameters of ﬂaring ARs, e.g. the ones based on properties of the horizontal gradient

of the LOS component of the magnetic ﬁeld (Kors´os et al. 2019, 2020), to further determining the energy

class and onset time of upcoming ﬂares.
