ABSTRACT
We study the magnetic structure of successively erupting sigmoid in active region 12371 by modeling
the quasi-static coronal ﬁeld evolution with non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) equilibria. HMI/SDO
vector magnetograms are used as input to the NLFFF model. In all eruption events, the modeled
structure resembles the observed pre-eruptive coronal sigmoid and the NLFFF core-ﬁeld is a combi-
nation of double inverse J-shaped and inverse-S ﬁeld-lines with dips touching the photosphere. Such
ﬁeld-lines are formed by ﬂux-cancellation reconnection of opposite-J ﬁeld-lines at bald-patch locations.
It implies the formation of a weakly twisted ﬂux-rope from large scale sheared arcade ﬁeld lines. Later
on, this ﬂux-rope undergo coronal tether-cutting reconnection until a CME is triggered. The modeled
structure captured these major features of sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid transformation, that is being
recurrent under continuous photospheric ﬂux motions. Calculations of the ﬁeld-line twist reveal a
fractional increase followed by a decrease of the number of pixels having a range of twist. This traces
the buildup process of a twisted core-ﬁeld by slow photospheric motions and the relaxation after erup-
tion, respectively. Our study infers that the large eruptivity of this AR is due to a steep decrease of
the background coronal ﬁeld meeting the torus instability criteria at low height (≈ 40 Mm) in contrast
to non-eruptive ARs.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is now accepted that the source of energy for all so-
lar activity is from magnetic ﬁelds. Active regions (ARs)
are higher concentrations of magnetic ﬁeld regions often
associated with violent activity like jets, ﬂares, coronal
mass ejections (CMEs) etc. In X-rays and EUV obser-
vations, these regions are sometimes seen with a sigmoid
structure (Rust & Kumar 1996; Gibson et al. 2002) sit-
uated over the central polarity inversion line (PIL). The
sigmoid structure is either forward or inverse S-shaped.
Several CMEs are seen to be launched from these sig-
moidal ARs and hence sigmoid is one of the most impor-
tant pre-cursor structure for solar eruptions (Manoha-
ran et al. 1996; Hudson et al. 1998; Canﬁeld et al. 1999,
2007). Two types of sigmoids were reported: transient
and long lived sigmoids. Transient sigmoids are sharp
and bright and they usually become clearly noticeable
only for a short time before eruption, while long-lived
ones appear more diﬀuse and can survive for several
hours, even days (Pevtsov 2002; McKenzie & Canﬁeld
2008).

The magnetic structure of sigmoids was described as
sheared arcade and ﬂux rope (FR) topology (Moore et al.
2001). In the sheared arcade model, the two magnetic el-
bows are sheared ﬁeld lines which are located nearby on
both sides of the PIL in the central part of the conﬁgura-
tion. In the FR scenario, a magnetic FR is embedded in
a stabilizing potential envelope ﬁeld (Moore & Roumeli-
otis 1992; Hood & Priest 1979; Titov & D´emoulin 1999).
How these sigmoids turn to be eruptive? Magnetic recon-
nection (resistive instability) plays the prime role in the

vemareddy@iiap.res.in

sheared arcade model as opposed to ideal MHD instabil-
ity in the FR model in triggering the eruption (Moore
et al. 2001; Antiochos et al. 1999; Amari et al. 2003;
T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005; Gibson et al. 2006). The interface
separating a coronal FR from its ambient ﬁeld usually
forms a sigmoidal shape when observed from above and
FRs are naturally invoked in diﬀerent models of sigmoids
(Titov & D´emoulin 1999; Gibson et al. 2006; Bobra et al.
2008; Savcheva & van Ballegooijen 2009). Sigmoids are
considered to result from enhanced current dissipation
in thin sheets which accumulate hot plasma along corre-
sponding shaped ﬁeld lines (Gibson et al. 2002; Janvier
2017) .

During the evolution of an AR, magnetic energy is built
up (during several hours or even days) in the corona due
to ﬂux emergence and photospheric motions (Schrijver
2009). The energy is stored in a non-potential ﬁeld as-
sociated to large scale electric currents (Priest & Forbes
2002; Aulanier et al. 2010).

Topological analysis of magnetic structures con-
structed from analytic conﬁgurations predicts that the
current sheets form along magnetic interface layers called
separatrices, as well along their generalization called
quasi-separatrix layers (Priest & D´emoulin 1995; Priest
& Forbes 2000; Aulanier et al. 2005). The connectivity
of ﬁeld lines is discontinuous for separatrices, while it
changes drastically along QSLs (Demoulin et al. 1996).
In an analytical force-free FR model embedded in an ar-
cade ﬁeld, Titov & D´emoulin (1999) showed that in the
process of the FR emerging rigidly into the corona, a sep-
aratrix surface, touching the photosphere at a so called
bald-patch (BP, B · ∇Bz|P IL > 0), is present along the
PIL section during the earlier phase of emergence. The

BP separatrix surface has a generic S-shape when viewed
from top, similar to sigmoid shape. In the later phase of
emergence, the S-shaped BP separatrix is transformed
into a double J-shaped QSL. The topological analysis
of the FR eruptions found co-spatial ﬂare ribbons with
hook-shaped QSLs (D´emoulin et al. 1996; Williams et al.
2005; Janvier et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2016), leading to
extension of 2D version of standard model to 3D (Janvier
et al. 2015).

In decaying ARs, the sigmoids were reported to be
formed by ﬂux cancellation induced by converging mo-
tions of magnetic elements towards PIL (Green & Kliem
2009; Tripathi et al. 2009; Vemareddy & Mishra 2015).
Helical ﬁeld lines are formed by reconnection of the
sheared ﬁeld lines (Pneuman 1983; van Ballegooijen &
Martens 1989). Indeed, numerical simulations had shown
the FR formation under cancelling magnetic ﬂux scenario
(e.g., Amari et al. 2003). On the other hand, numeri-
cal models producing FRs also relied on magnetic ﬂux
emergence of twisted FRs originating from the convec-
tion zone and rising through the photosphere (Magara
2001; Fan & Gibson 2004; Gibson et al. 2004; Archontis
et al. 2009; Hood et al. 2012). In these models, as the FR
emerges a ﬁlamentary current sheet forms, reconnection
occurs and a new coronal FR is formed. When integrated
along the local vertical, the current sheet appears as sig-
moid.

Observationally studying the 3D magnetic structure
of AR is presently not possible. Therefore, one relies
on models based on ﬁeld measurements at the photo-
sphere as the lower boundary condition. A non-linear
force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model is typically used to re-
construct pre-eruptive coronal ﬁeld (Valori et al. 2005;
Savcheva & van Ballegooijen 2009; Wiegelmann 2008; De
Rosa et al. 2009; Jiang & Feng 2012). This is justiﬁed
by the low–β coronal condition. However, this is not
realised at the photospheric level and a pre-processing
procedure is applied to drive the lower boundary towards
force-free condition (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). Moreover,
the photospheric ﬂow speed is very slow, typically well
below 1 km s−1(Vemareddy et al. 2012) , compared to
the coronal ﬁeld relaxing speed to equilibrium, which is
several hundred km s−1. Therefore, the coronal ﬁeld
evolution, driven by slow photospheric motion, can be
approximated as a quasi-static evolution and it is mod-
elled by time sequence of successive static force-free equi-
libria. It enables to study the build-up of pre-eruptive
3D structure like sigmoid, then to ﬁnd hints on the most
appropriate conﬁgurations leading to eruptions (e.g., Sun
et al. 2012, 2013; Savcheva et al. 2012a; Jiang et al. 2014;
Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014; Vemareddy et al. 2016).
In present article, we construct 3D magnetic structure
of sigmoidal AR by NLFFF model and study the pre-
eruptive conﬁguration of observed CMEs. For tis pur-
pose, we employ vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements at
the photospheric level obtained from Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board So-
lar Dynamic Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). We
study below the AR 12371 which was producing succes-
sive fast CMEs during its disk transit. In EUV obser-
vations, the pre-eruptive conﬁguration of all CMEs is
a sigmoid. Being CME productive, we study how the
sigmoid developed repeatedly and how it was brought

eventually to instability. This case is in contrast with
most previous studies of decaying ARs where only one
single sigmoid eruption was present during the observa-
tion window (D´emoulin et al. 2002; Green & Kliem 2009;
Green et al. 2011; Vemareddy & Mishra 2015). Based on
the time sequence of this static NLFFF extrapolations,
we focus on studying 1) the sigmoid build up in the pre-
eruptive conﬁguration, 2) the build up of the coronal
electric currents and their dissipation during eruption, 3)
the magnetic energy, 4) the evolution of ﬁeld line twist
distribution and, 5) the role of the background ﬁeld in
driving the eruptions. We outline the observations dur-
ing CME onset in Section 2. Results of the above studies
are described in Section 3. Summary with a discussion
of the results is given in Section 4.

2. OUTLINE OF OBSERVATIONS AND CONTEXT

OF THE STUDY
AR 12371 is an AR formed before its appearance at the
eastern limb. It produced successive fast CMEs in a span
of its disk transit (18-25 June, 2015). Recent study of this
AR by Vemareddy (2017) presented a detailed analysis
of the magnetic evolution in relation with the initiat-
ing mechanism of the successive CMEs. Here we give a
brief outline of earlier results in the context of this study.
Observations at the Sun register the initiation times of
four eruptions as 15:05 UT on 18 (SOL2015-06-18T15:05,
CME1), 00:45 UT on 21 (SOL2015-06-21T00:45, CME2),
16:15 UT on 22 (SOL2015-06-22T16:15, CME3), and
07:30 UT on 25 (SOL2015-06-25T07:30, CME4) of June
2015, respectively, by the commencement of enhancing
EUV brightening associated to fast structural changes.
Subsequently, the disk integrated GOES X-ray light
curve (Figure 1) delineates that the CMEs are asso-
ciated with long duration M-class ﬂares starting from
18/16:25 UT, 21T02:00 UT, 22T17:39 UT, 25T08:02 UT
These CMEs emerged the C2 ﬁeld-

1000 km s−1) in LASCO ﬁeld-of-view.

reconnection is seen with L1. Fifth row: Composite images of coronal observations in AIA 94 ˚A (red), 335 ˚A (green), and 193 ˚A (blue)

for more details.

snapshots at diﬀerent times are selected to best show
the observed structures. All image panels are aligned ac-
counting spatial scales. In the ﬁrst row, we plot line of
sight magnetograms obtained from HMI. The AR suc-
cessive passage reveals presence of leading negative ﬂux

(N1) with a following bipole with negative (N2, N3) and
positive (P1, P2) ﬂux regions. The inner bipole (N2,
N3) is seen with large shear and converging motions (see
Figure 6 of Vemareddy 2017) with respect to (P1, P2),

with a blue curve. The ﬁeld distribution of (N2, N3) be-

comes diﬀused and disintegrated in successive days while
the leader polarity is increasingly separated from the fol-
lowing polarity.

In the second row of Figure 2, we plot GONG-Hα im-
ages. They show the presence of a dark ﬁlament between
leading and following sunspots before the eruptions. In
tandem, 304 ˚A observations from the Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) are well in sup-
port with Hα, showing co-spatial existence of continuous
ﬁlament channel. A ﬁlament is present on the PIL por-
tion southward of the AR. It could only be related to the
faint magnetic ﬁeld observed southward of the AR and
be irrelevant to the eruption, since no apparent change of
the ﬁlament can be recognized after the commencement
of EUV brightening from the time sequences associated
to Figure 2. The 131˚A channel of AIA (fourth row pan-
els) evidences sheared loop morphology comparable to
those previously reported in other ARs (e.g. Moore et al.
2001). They consist of two opposite J-shaped loops out-
lined by L1 and L2 (dashed orange curves) identiﬁed from
sequence of images. We call them magnetic elbows. The
inner ends of these loops are nearby and crossed each
other with a sharp interface low over the PIL. Finally,
the composite images prepared from the hot AIA chan-
nels are shown in the bottom row of Figure 2. They
provide the evidence for continuous sigmoidal structure
(labeled L3) during the initiation of all four CMEs.

The conﬁguration outlined by L1 and L2, especially in
the three last events, is typically found in models hav-
ing a sheared core (e.g. Antiochos et al. 1994; Aulanier
et al. 2010). In the tether-cutting scenario, magnetic re-
connection is initiated at the interface of L1 and L2 clos-
est legs when converging motions push the legs against
each other. The large-scale reconnected ﬁeld lines have a
shape comparable to L3. This reconnection progressively
transforms sheared ﬁeld lines, such as observed with L1
and L2, to twisted ﬁeld lines, as outlined with L3. As
reconnection proceeds further, the FR bulges and rises in
height. In numerical simulations (Aulanier et al. 2010),
once the FR is at a too large height, the conﬁguration
becomes unstable and the FR escapes the coronal closed
ﬁeld environment into the outer corona as a CME. The
AIA composite images (ﬁfth row panels in Figure 2) ev-
idence this ﬂux-rope (labelled as L3) during initiation of
CMEs.

The study of magnetic ﬁeld evolution (please refer to
Figure 7 in Vemareddy (2017)) implies decreasing mag-
netic ﬂux in both AR polarities, which is an indication of
magnetic ﬂux cancellation. Velocity ﬁeld of ﬂux motions
derived from DAVE4VM (Schuck 2008) show the shear
and converging motions, which are in support of above
tether cutting reconnection, within the inner bipolar re-
gions (Figure 3). These motions were suggested to be
prime factors to the ﬂux cancellation and the net ﬂux
decrease (Chae et al. 2002, 2004). Under this ﬂux evolu-
tion, the net current and αav (mean twist parameter of
magnetic ﬁeld) show increasing trend till June 22. This
is an indication of build up of non-potentiality (Martin
1998; Wang & Muglach 2007). Further, with these ob-
servational ﬁndings of magnetic evolution, Vemareddy
(2017) described that the repeated sigmoid formation
and its eruption by successive CMEs is a result of en-
ergy storage and release by persistent shearing and con-

verging motions. With monotonous injection of negative
helicity, the corona over-accumulates helicity and expels
excess helicity by CME. Predominant inﬂux of helicity
of either sign over time is the key for the formation of
coronal sigmoid or FR, which would be initiated to ejec-
tion by ideal or non-ideal instability (Moore et al. 2001;
T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005). Using vector magnetic ﬁeld ob-
servations at the photosphere, in the present article, we
study the diﬀerent aspects in magnetic structure of the
pre-eruptive sigmoid with NLFFF models.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Non-linear Force-free Modelling of the AR Field
The AR magnetic structure is reconstructed by per-
forming nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation
of the observed photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld (Bo-
bra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2014). The procedure
minimizes a volume integral including a linear combina-
tion of the Lorentz force and of the magnetic ﬁeld diver-
gence (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010).
The ﬁeld of view of the boundary ﬁeld covers the full AR
such that ﬂux is nearly balanced over the entire time in-
terval. During all four CME events, the ﬂux imbalance is
less than 8%. To further satisfy the force-free conditions,
the magnetic ﬁeld components are subjected to a pre-
processing procedure (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). Next,
we rebinned the observations to 1 arc-second per pixel.
In order to weaken the eﬀects of the lateral boundaries,
the observed boundary is inserted in an extended ﬁeld
of view and computations are performed on a uniformly
spaced computational grid of 512 × 512 × 256 represent-
ing physical dimensions of 373 × 373 × 186 Mm3. To
reduce the eﬀect of pseudo top and side boundaries on
the evolving interior ﬁeld, a boundary wall (of width 64
grid points) of cosine weighting function is used in the
function which is minimized.

The NLFFF code is initiated with a 3D potential ﬁeld
constructed from the vertical ﬁeld component of the ob-
served ﬁeld (Gary 1989). After introducing the photo-
spheric vector magnetic ﬁeld at the lower boundary, the
magnetic ﬁeld is relaxed the most possible to decrease
both the Lorentz force and the divergence of the magnetic
ﬁeld. Typically, the observed photospheric ﬁeld, even af-
ter processing, is not compatible with the NLFFF state,
but it can be relaxed to a state with an average angle
typically around 9 degrees between the electric current
and magnetic ﬁeld vectors in the computational volume.
A typical vector magnetogram used in the NLFFF re-
construction is shown in Figure 3a. The rectangular box
covers the inner bipolar region. Horizontal velocity ﬁeld,
derived from DAVE4VM method, indicate a large scale
converging and shear motions of opposite polarities in
the inner bipolar region as displayed in panel b). Un-
der these motions, the ﬁeld vectors are sheared where
the angle between potential transverse ﬁeld and the ob-
served transverse ﬁeld is non zero. We measured the
shear angle deﬁned as the angle between the potential
transverse ﬁeld and the observed transverse ﬁeld. In pan-
els c-f), these shear angle maps are displayed at diﬀer-
ent epochs of evolution. Both the positive and negative
polarities have sheared locations greater than 45◦. Espe-
cially, the negative polarity region is more sheared than
positive polarity. The magnetic shear is in particular im-

a result of ﬂux cancellation along the PIL and dispersion of the photospheric ﬁeld, the polarity regions decayed in area from June 18 to 25.
In all panels, the axis units are in pixels of 0.5 arcsec.

portant around the PIL in between (N2, N3) and (P1,
P2) (See Figure 2 for polarity identiﬁcation). Tracked
magnetograms infer a southward motion of the negative
polarity with respect to the positive polarity. This is the
main origin of this shear region (Vemareddy 2017).

As pointed by Moore et al. (2001), two likely factors for
the eruption are the ﬂux content of the sheared core ﬁeld
relative to the envelope ﬁeld and the height at which
the reconnection begins. The greater the reconnection
height, the smaller the fraction of the core ﬁeld that can
be released as the eruption proceeds. We compute the
shear angle in the inner bipolar region (rectangular box in
Figure 3a) for the vector magnetograms recorded just be-
fore all three eruptions. In this bipolar region, we found
that 20%, 30%, 30% of pixels have greater than 45◦ shear
angle, while the pixels with shear angle greater than 25◦
are 58%, 45%, 48% respectively for the last three events.
Alternatively, the numbers meet the Moore et al’s ﬁrst
criteria of excess ﬂux content of sheared core ﬁeld with
shear angle above 25◦.

In Figure 4, we show the NLFFF magnetic structure
just before the CMEs. Being located at E50◦, the CME1
is excluded for further analysis due to severe projection
eﬀects. The ﬁeld lines are selected according to the to-
tal current density (|J| = 1
(∇ × B)) and the horizon-
µ0
(cid:113)
tal ﬁeld component (Bh =

y), i.e., the seed

x + B2

B2

points are biased with large |J|, Bh in a subvolume cov-
ering the inner bipolar region. This will ensure to select
ﬁeld lines that outline most of the observed coronal loops
(Figure 2). A color scheme according to Bh strength is
applied for the ﬁeld lines. The bottom plane is Bz in
ﬁrst column panels. Field lines connecting the periph-
eral regions of P1 and N2 form one J-section loop set,
and those connecting N1 and P2 form another J-section
loop set. These two bundles of J-shaped ﬁeld lines are
formed by highly sheared arcades.

Owing to line-tied shearing motions of the foot points,
the ﬁeld lines near the PIL, in the AR center, are strongly
sheared. They are enveloping ﬁeld lines over the mid-
dle of the sigmoid. This sheared magnetic conﬁguration,
as shown in Figure 2, being further driven by converg-
ing motions, of two opposite J-sections is expected to
favor the formation of FR by tether-cutting reconnec-
tion (Titov & D´emoulin 1999; Jiang et al. 2012; Savcheva
et al. 2012a).

To compare this modeled magnetic structure to coro-
nal observations, the same ﬁeld lines are over plotted on
EUV observations of corona in 171˚A and 94 ˚A passbands
(second and third column panels). The EUV loops are
in global agreement with the NLFFF twisted structure
in each panel (in agreement with previous results, Sun
et al. 2012; Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014). Remark-
ably, the intense hot emission is mostly co-spatial with

the NLFFF sheared core. The sheared core is less com-
pact for the last event on June 25 compared to others.
This indicates a relaxed conﬁguration after a sequence
of eruptions and quasi-static evolution in between two
events.

We point that the projection eﬀects in the corona are
greater than for the photosphere. Notedly, being away
from disk center, projection eﬀects introduce some de-
partures with large scale loops especially for 25 June (lo-
cated at 40◦ west). However, the low lying core structure
is nearly reproduced because disk transformation from
local to observer frames mostly take into account these
projection eﬀects.

In a study of sigmoid eruption from another AR (AR
11283) Jiang et al. (2014) reported the FR formation by
reconnection which was attached to photosphere at the
bald patch (BP) until eruption. Following their analysis,
we further discuss the eruption cases in AR 12371 as fol-
lows. In Figure 5, we examine the core ﬁeld topology of
the NLFFF structure. Field lines anchoring away from
the PIL correspond to two J-sections with their arms
farther apart from the PIL. For the events on June 21
and 22, the ﬁeld lines anchored near the PIL are inverse
S-shaped and graze the PIL. Indeed, we note little dif-
ference in the observed EUV morphology with the core
ﬁeld. The northern sigmoid elbow in all the cases could

twisted ﬁeld embedded in large-scale sheared arcade. The twisted ﬁeld is co-spatial with EUV emission, whereas emission from the northern
elbow comes from high lying potential ﬁeld. (see also Figure 4) Second column: Top view of the core ﬁeld line structure. The photospheric

ern elbow seem to constitute by a continuity of ﬁeld lines
belonging to both low lying core ﬁeld and high lying ar-
cade to the leading polarity.

BP separatrix is a common topological

feature in
sheared bipolar regions, where the buildup of FR be-
gins with the appearance of BP (Titov & D´emoulin 1999;
Aulanier et al. 2010). In Figure 6, the ﬁeld lines along
the PIL are displayed in a close view for BP topology.
The structure for the event on June 21 clearly show BP
separatrix ﬁeld lines. Field lines surrounding the BP sep-
aratrix are combination of inverse-J and S shaped ﬁeld
lines. A prominent dip touching tangentially the magne-
togram level is displayed in the perspective view in the
top right panel of Figure 6 for event 2. A similar topol-
ogy is evident for event 3 and 4.
In the case of event
4, the ﬁeld line dips are not touching the magnetogram
level (zdip (cid:39) 0.2 Mm above this level) so in this case a

BP region is not present at the photospheric level. Still,
the inverse S-shape for the ﬁeld lines is clear. Notedly,
these BP/dip locations moves southward in time.

As is the case in AR 12371, ﬂux cancellation is a pro-
cess transforming double J-shaped ﬁeld lines to an S-
shaped FR (van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Feynman
& Hundhausen 1994) and is associated with the forma-
tion of BP with ﬁeld lines tangential to the magnetogram
level. This process is also expected to occur in our stud-
ied cases. Converging motions toward PIL drive the ﬂux
cancellation reconnection resulting in long FR ﬁeld line
and evidently the ﬁeld lines of NLFFF along PIL include
crossed inverse-J and S. Finally, we notice that the BP
locations evolve along the PIL before CMEs (not shown)
so that magnetic reconnection, building the FR, is ex-
pected to occur at intermittent positions along the PIL.
BP separatrices are preferential sites of thin current
sheets due to persistent photospheric shearing motions.

maps. These ﬁeld lines are combination of double inverse-J and S shape along the PIL. Right column: Perspective view of the same ﬁeld
lines having prominent dips touching tangentially the photosphere. Arrows point to the ﬁeld line dips near to the surface (z = 0). This
kind of topology is suited for ﬂux cancellation reconnection of inverse J-shape ﬁeld lines to form inverse-S shape ﬁeld lines and the FR.

The reconnection of ﬁeld lines in these current sheets
produces high temperature emission visible in hot AIA
passbands. As reconnection progresses dynamically, the
FR builds by added ﬂux. In this phase, it has been shown
by MHD numerical simulations that the BP bifurcates
resulting in the transformation of a BP separatrix to a
QSL (Aulanier et al. 2010). Then the standard coronal
tether-cutting reconnection sets in below the FR elevat-
ing its main body. Later on, the FR becomes unstable

leading to the ﬂare onset (Aulanier et al. 2010; Savcheva
et al. 2012a,b). The snapshot of NLFFF model only
captures static structure indicating BP topology i.e., the
global magnetic topology evolution but not the dynamic
reconnection.

Moreover, the precursor brightening (4th row panels in
Figure 2) is co-spatial with the twisted core ﬁeld (Fig-
ure 5). The brightening commences around an hour be-
fore the main eruption with the appearance of an hot

inverse-S trace in the core, commencing the bright rib-
bons in the ﬂare phase. Then, the forming FR by ﬂux
cancellation detaches the photosphere earlier on, favoring
coronal tether-cutting reconnection, as in the numerical
simulations reported above.

3.2. Coronal Current Distribution
Owing to time evolution of coronal magnetic ﬁeld by
persistent slow photospheric shearing motions, we see a
transition of potential-like arcade in the post eruption
phase of previous eruption to double inverse J-shaped
sheared arcade (this transition is analyzed in Section
3.4). This process naturally builds coronal volume cur-
rents in the stressed conﬁguration. To have more in-
sights on the coronal current distribution, we examine
direct volume rendering of |J| (not shown). Near the
magnetic ﬁeld concentrations, |J| is stronger since |J| is
proportional to |B| along a ﬁeld line in a force-free ﬁeld.
Especially, intense |J| are present above the inner bipolar

region corresponding to the sheared/twisted ﬁeld struc-
ture.

Further, we vertically integrated |J| in the coronal vol-
ume and the resulting 2D maps are shown in ﬁrst column
panels of Figure 7. The overall morphology of this cur-
rent distribution is similar to the sigmoid observed in
EUV (Figure 2). For the event 4 of June 25, the |J| dis-
tribution in the core is somewhat less intense than for
the two previous events. This is associated with diﬀer-
ence in compactness and twist of the ﬁeld structure seen
in panel (C2) of Figure 5.

Corresponding to before and after the eruption, in the
second and third column panels of Figure 7, we dis-
play |J| obtained in vertical slice planes placed across
the sigmoid. The locations of these slices are shown in
the left panels of Figure 7. White curves represent Bz
contours (±80 G) extracted in the same slice.

|J| corresponds to AR core that is conﬁned below about

the distributed coronal current on either side of the PIL,
whereas above the PIL the intense current concentration
corresponds to twisted core ﬁeld.

The smaller height of coronal current in June 25 panel
likely indicates less stressed ﬁeld owing to less compact
sheared core as seen in Figure 5 (bottom row). These re-
sults delineate that the pre-eruption conﬁguration com-
prises a sheared/twisted core with intense coronal electric
currents above the PIL. For events 2 and 3 (top and mid-
dle rows) the electric current is more concentrated before
than after the eruption. After the eruption, in the last
column panels, the coronal current is less dense due to
expansion of the core ﬁeld.

3.3. Field Line Twist Maps
Given 3D ﬁeld distribution, one can calculate the twist
number for each ﬁeld line (Berger & Prior 2006; Inoue
et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2016)

since α is constant for each individual ﬁeld line. A 4π
factor in the denominator includes a factor that converts
radians into turns and a factor (2) relating local twist
(radians per unit length) with α (Longcope et al. 1998).
In the extrapolation, the magnetic ﬁeld is not exactly
force-free so we rather perform the integration with ∇×B
within the integral. B and ∇ × B are computed at any
point in the volume by tri-linear interpolation. Then,
the line integral is carried out by a ﬁve-point Newton-
Cotes formula using the procedure int tabulated.pro
available in IDL. For a ﬁner structure of Tw distribution,
the ﬁeld line integration is performed on a grid of spatial
resolution double that of extrapolation grid. The ﬁeld
lines, that reach one lateral or top boundary, are assumed
to be open, and they are set with zero value of Tw.

The resultant Tw maps at the times before the onset of
CMEs are displayed in left column panels of Figure 8. We
ﬁnd that the ﬁeld line twist magnitude does not exceeds
1.1 turns across the maps at diﬀerent times. Therefore,
we scale the maps within ±1.1 turns on a blue-red color
map. The central core has always negative values of Tw
ranging from -1.0 to -0.4 turns. In all the cases, a highly-
twisted core, surrounded by Tw values with opposite sign,
is observed.

For a more quantitative analysis, we choose a smaller
rectangular region surrounding the core of the sigmoid
for the three events (its extension is shown in the central
left panel of Figure 8), and perform an histogram analy-
sis of Tw at pixels with |Bz| > 120G. Within this region,
the fraction of pixels having more than one turn is 1.4%,
1.2%, 1.46% respectively before these successive CMEs.
Similarly, the fraction of pixels with 0.5 < |Tw| < 1 turn
is still small since it is limited to 11.8%, 15%, 12% re-
spectively of the total number of pixels with |Tw| > 0
within the selected rectangular region.

We compare the above results with the ones obtained
for another AR where twisting motions were analyzed
(AR 10930 Inoue et al. 2011). The fraction of pixels in
the above two intervals of twist is 5% and 40%, respec-
tively. Therefore, it appears that rotational ﬂux mo-
tions are more eﬃcient in injecting twist and helicity
than shear and converging motions, as expected. Fur-
ther, according to T¨or¨ok et al. (2004), the critical twist
to destabilize the ideal MHD kink modes in an anchored
magnetic loop is about 1.75. Therefore, the observed
low twist distribution in the studied AR suggests that
the kink instability is not a relevant process to trigger
these eruptions.

The right column panels of Figure 8 show histograms
of Tw, where each panel shows variation of Tw distribu-
tion during the CME eruption. To show how Tw vary,
we compute Tw at two epochs before eruption and one
epoch after eruption and plotted in diﬀerent colors (blue
color histogram is after eruption). Note that the asym-
metric distribution is a signature of dominant negative
twist in rectangular region corresponding to core ﬂux. In
all cases, the occurrences in the histogram wings is lower
than that before the CME. To quantify this decrease of
twist owing to magnetic energy release, we count the
pixels with |Tw| above and below 0.3 turns and express
in terms of percentage change from higher values (> 0.3)
to lower values during pre-to-post eruption evolution. At
the epochs before CME eruption, the percentage of pixels
above 0.3 turns is 28%, 31%, 32% respectively, suggest-

ing increasing twisted ﬂux from ﬁrst to last event. For
the three CME cases on 21, 22 and 25 June, we found
that the above percent of pixels decrease to 26%, 29%,
16% (so a decrease of 2%, 2%, 16%) respectively. The
corresponding eﬀect is seen with the histograms, where
the histogram wings in the post eruption shrink below
that for pre-eruption.

3.4. Buildup of a Sheared/Twisted Core Field
As AR magnetic structure evolves, the formation of a
twisted core ﬁeld from an initial arcade conﬁguration is
expected under the eﬀect of shearing and converging mo-
tions. To show this, the NLFFF reconstruction is applied
at diﬀerent times in the post eruption evolution of CME1
on June 18. In Figure 9, we show magnetic structure of
the AR at three instances. The ﬁrst snapshot is in the re-
laxing phase present after the CME1. The core ﬁeld has
a remnant shear besides elbow ﬁeld lines. In the course
of further evolution driven by slow shearing/converging
motions, the core ﬁeld becomes twisted gradually.
In
particular, in the later two snapshots (pointed by white
color arrow), the core ﬁeld appears more like a bundle
of twisted ﬁeld lines (FR). In addition, the elbow ﬁeld
lines appear more compact than earlier on. This buildup
of twisted core is a key process of energy storage in the
sigmoid structure which occurs to reform the FR from
the pre-eruption arcade. This leads to the launch of the
CME2 at 02:00 UT on June 21.

This development of a twisted core is further stud-
ied quantitatively by utilizing the twist Tw maps derived
from the NLFFF extrapolations. Similar to earlier sec-
tion, in the last panel of Figure 9 we display histograms of
Tw maps at four times in the aftermath evolution of the
CME1. This time evolution of histograms delineate the
transfer of pixels about the center (with |Tw| < 0.5) to-
ward the wings (|Tw| > 0.5). The fraction of pixels with
|Tw| > 1 turn shows a slight increase from 0.4% to 1.2%
from ﬁrst instance to the last. However, corresponding
to the buildup of the sheared core, the fraction of pixels
with 0.5 < |Tw| < 1 is signiﬁcant and growing from 6.1%
to 11.3%, so almost by a factor 2. If we rather select the
interval 0.3 < |Tw| < 1, the fractional increase is lower
as it grows from 21.2% to 29.7% from ﬁrst instance to
the last one, so increasing only by a factor ≈ 1.4.

from the NLFFF and potential ﬁelds of the AR. For this
purpose, we consider the time frames before and after the
eruption. Speciﬁcally, we choose the pre-ﬂare snapshot
just before the ﬁrst observed brightenings and the post
eruption snapshot at the end of the ﬂare decay phase
ensuring the ﬁeld relaxation gets captured in the vector
magnetograms.

We caution that our computations of free energy esti-
mation is subjected to errors due to projection eﬀects, ex-

trapolation model, and noise/bias in input observations.
Moreover, implicit smoothing in preprocessing procedure
also contributes underestimating the actual coronal free
energy content.

During the three CME cases the plots in Figure 10
delineate that most of the coronal free energy is contained
below 20 Mm and Ef,s is maximum a low height, below 5
Mm. This energy is related to the coronal electric current
distribution depicted in Figure 7. Ef,s decrease for event
2 is small, while for events 3 and 4 the decrease of Ef,s
is signiﬁcant in the range 10-30 Mm. Only in event 3 an
increase of Ef,s is present at low height.

In Table 1, the global energies for all three CME events
are reported. In each case the time is considered just be-
fore and after the ﬂares as above. Ep and Et are of the
order of 1033 erg, which is the typical energy content
of large ARs (e.g., AR12192 Jiang et al. 2016b). From
event 2 through 3, Ep drops gradually. This is consistent
with the photospheric magnetic ﬂux which is decreasing
both by dispersion and by cancellation at the PIL. A
decreasing Ep with reducing AR ﬂux content is also ob-
served in AR 11283 in the study by Jiang et al. (2014).
In all events the potential energy is almost the same be-
fore and after (Table 1) as expected because of the small
observed evolution during the events of the vertical ﬁeld
component at the photospheric level. The magnetic en-
ergy available for an event, which is converted e.g. as
kinetic, thermal and radiative energies, is mostly the dif-
ference of coronal magnetic energy between after and be-
fore the event since eruptions are involving the ejection
of closed magnetic structures and since the energy input
by photospheric shearing motion is small compare to the
energy accumulated between two events (with a constant
ﬂux rate, this ratio is the ratio of the durations, so of the
order of 2/24 ≈ 0.1).

The magnetic free energy drop for the three events is
0.05, 0.17, 0.46 in units of 1032 ergs, respectively, ac-
counting for 2.3%, 6.4%, 32% of the pre-eruption free
energy. These small values are qualitatively consistent
with the estimates of twist number variation in Section
3.3, where only a small number of ﬁeld lines (upto 16%)
show a variation of twist number corresponding to ﬁeld
reconﬁguration.

In summary, our analysis suggests that magnetic en-
ergy is being pre-stored in the magnetic structure by
gradual shearing motions around the PIL, then it is re-
leased by intermittent eruptions.

3.6. Torus Instability
To reveal the role of background ﬁeld, we also compute
the decay index n(z) = −d log(Bh)/d log z, where Bh is
the horizontal component of the background ﬁeld and z
is the height above the photosphere. Since the vertical
magnetic-ﬁeld component does not contributes to the in-
ward conﬁning force, the decay index is computed only
with the horizontal components of the ﬁeld. This back-
ground ﬁeld strength decides the torus instability (TI)
criteria. T¨or¨ok & Kliem (2005) proposed the value of 1.5
as a critical decay index. In fact, the critical value of n
depends on a number of factors, but is expected to be
in the range 1.1 ≤ ncrit ≤ 2 (Bateman 1978; Kliem &
T¨or¨ok 2006; D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010).

In the present study, Bh(z) is obtained at diﬀerent
spatial points located along the PIL in the inner bipolar

Fig. 10.— Free energy Ef,s, Equation (2), in horizontal planes
as a function of height (z, in Mm). Blue (red) curve represents
Ef,s before (after) eruption (Table 1). Most of the free energy is
located below 20 Mm. On average, the post eruption curves are
below pre-eruption curves, indicating that, as expected, Ef,s drops
through the CME eruption.

region. Then an average value of n(z) is derived corre-
sponding to Bh(z) at those points in both potential ﬁeld
and NLFFF (grey and black curves in Figure 11).

The theory separates the FR magnetic ﬁeld from the
background ﬁeld and n(z) is only computed from the
background ﬁeld. This separation is trivial because an-
alyzed analytical models are constructed by the super-
position of these two ﬁelds. However, with magnetic ex-
trapolations there is no precise way to separate the FR
ﬁeld, or its associated electric currents, from the back-
ground. Then, we consider two extreme limits: all the
currents are associated with the FR, so the background
ﬁeld is potential, and at the opposite the FR has a negli-

Vemareddy & Dem´oulin

There is some height diﬀerence for ncrit (up to 10 Mm)
for NLFFF and potential ﬁeld, but the average critical
height is around 40 Mm.

The TI domain in AR 12371 is comparable to other
eruptive ARs, for instance, the ﬂare-CME productive
ARs 11158, 11429 have TI critical height of 42, 34 Mm
respectively (Sun et al. 2015). Notedly, the horizontal
ﬁeld at 42 Mm in these eruptive cases is (∼ 50 G), so
smaller by a factor of four than in conﬁned AR 12192
(230 G). ARs with failed eruptions have a distinct TI
height range compared to ARs with successful eruptions.
Recent observations found that the critical height for TI
can be as high as 236 Mm (Wang et al. 2017). For a
conﬁned eruption studied by (Guo et al. 2010), ncrit is
always above 100 Mm suggesting a stronger restraining
ﬁeld over the FR. Similarly, the CME less AR 12192 is
found to have stronger overlying ﬁeld with a TI critical
height up to 77 Mm (Sun et al. 2015). Indeed, the su-
per AR 12192, producing large ﬂares without CMEs, is
found to have more closed ﬁeld ﬂux above than in the
sheared core ﬁeld surrounding the PIL (Sun et al. 2015;
Jiang et al. 2016b).

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We study the magnetic structure of AR 12371, by mod-
eling the coronal ﬁeld with the photospheric vector mag-
netic ﬁeld measurements, in relation to the erupting sig-
moid observed successively over days. The AR coronal
magnetic ﬁeld is mainly driven by continued shear mo-
tions at the photospheric level, which inject helicity ﬂux
of dominant negative sign (See Figure 8 in Vemareddy
2017). Being co-spatial with the sigmoid, the injected
helicity ﬂux is mostly included in the sheared/twisted
ﬁeld of the sigmoid. As the coronal ﬁeld can not accom-
modate indeﬁnite an accumulation of magnetic helicity,
a CME is inevitable (Low 1994), then the stored helicity
is partly ejected with the FR.

In the present study of the three events, the model ﬁeld
structure of pre-eruptive sigmoid has a low-lying twisted
core and an overlying arcade resembling the sigmoid mor-
phology observed in coronal EUV images. The NLFFF
core is dominantly embedded in a large scale sheared ar-
cade with the inner part along the PIL having opposite
J-shaped ﬁeld lines with crossed legs. Closer and above
the PIL inverse-S ﬁeld lines with dips touching tangen-
tially the photosphere are present (Figure 6). This kind
of topology is a manifestation of BP-separatrix ﬁeld lines
formed by photospheric reconnection of opposite-J ﬁeld
lines and indicates the formation of weakly twisted FR
at the inner core of the sigmoid embedded in the large
scale sheared arcade (Antiochos et al. 1999). As shown in
previous simulations (see Section 1), a larger FR is pro-
gressively build up by reconnection at the photospheric
level, then in the corona below the FR. At some point of
the evolution the FR become unstable which leads to a
CME.

Moreover, the NLFFF modeled structure captured ma-
jor features of energy storage and release mechanism,
viz., sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid transformation, that
is being recurrent under continuous photospheric ﬂux
motions. Calculations of the ﬁeld line twist reveal an in-
crease of pixels (≈ 7% averaging over the events) having
a range of ﬁeld line twist (0.3 < Tw < 1), indicating the
quasi-static buildup process of twisted core ﬁeld by slow

Fig. 11.— Decay index (n) of the background ﬁeld (ordinate) as
a function of vertical height (abscissa, in Mm). Black (gray) con-
tinuous curve represents the mean decay index obtained from the
potential (NLFFF) ﬁeld, respectively. The horizontal ﬁeld strength
(Bh [G]) is also plotted at the same spatial locations with dashed
lines within a range between 0 and 500 G (see the scale located
on the right side of panels). Dotted horizontal line indicates the
critical value of ncrit = 1.5. For all three events, this critical value
of n corresponds to a height just below or ≈ 40 Mm.

gible fraction of electric currents, so the background ﬁeld
is the full NLFFF. These are clearly very extreme cases
but we show below that the results are comparable so
that we do not need to deﬁne what is the ﬁeld associated
to the FR for this study of the decay index.

In Figure 11, we plot n(z) above z=0 plane. Bh is also
plotted (in units of Gauss) with its scale reported on the
right of each panel. In all three cases, the n(z) for po-
tential ﬁeld and NLFFF follows each other except short
scale spikes in NLFFF arising due to diﬀerentiation of
a more structured ﬁeld. For all three cases, the charac-
teristic curve n(z) approaches the critical value, set to
ncrit = 1.5, at a height between 20 and 50 Mm, indi-
cating a favorable magnetic environment for the destabi-
lization of the FR, then the launch of a CME when the
magnetic evolution brings the FR axis to such height.

shearing and converging motions around the PIL. Sim-
ilarly, we observed a decrease of pixels within the same
range of twist, consistent with the decrease of free energy
corresponding to the ﬁeld reconﬁguration from sigmoid
to potential like arcade during the eruption.

The magnetic evolution in this AR is in contrast to the
conﬁned AR 12192 which has a larger helicity ﬂux but a
much weaker (by a factor of 10) normalized coronal he-
licity content (H/Φ2). As inferred by Vemareddy (2017),
a small value of H/Φ2 implies a large ﬂux content unre-
lated to sheared/twisted part. This ﬂux is present as an
overlying ﬂux to stabilize the FR. This is complemented
by the results of n(z) in the AR ﬁeld. The critical height
in eruptive AR 12371 is around 40 Mm while in conﬁned
AR 12192, it is at larger height (77 Mm, Sun et al. 2015).
The ejective nature of AR 12371 diﬀers in some global
magnetic properties with respect to those of conﬁned
eruptive ARs. The super AR 12192 is an interesting
example being not producing any CME even in associ-
ation with X-class ﬂares and therefore is a non-eruptive
counterpart of AR 12371. Data driven modeling of AR
12192, performed by Jiang et al. (2016b), have shown
that the AR ﬁeld structure remained in the sheared ar-
cade conﬁguration without forming two-J shape like and
escaping FR unlike the AR case studied here.

Our analysis of observations are based on static mod-

eling of NLFFF of AR magnetic structure. More insights
on dynamic aspects of FR formation, its lift oﬀ can be
gained from data driven MHD modeling of the AR (e.g.,
Jiang et al. 2012, 2016a) and would be worth of further
investigation.
