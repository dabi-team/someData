Abstract 
Normally, the focal length of a conventional lens is fixed. Scientists have made much effort in 
modulating  it  into  bifocal,  which  is  very  important  for  virtual  reality  (VR)  and  argument 
reality (AR) 3D display. It is even much more difficult for a lens to realize both convex and 
concave  functions  with  one  geometric  structure,  that  is,  a  concave/convex  switchable  lens, 
which  can  tune  3D  real-images  and  virtual-images  in  AR  and  VR,  corresponding  to  long 
depth  of  view  in  3D  display.  Based  on  the  tunable  refractive  indexes  of  phase-change 
materials,  here  we  propose  a  series  of  concave/convex  switchable  lenses.  When  the 
phase-change material is in different states, one switchable lens is able to perform a negative 
or  positive  focal  length,  or  perform  negative  and  positive  focal  lengths  simultaneously.  The 
lenses can be either cylindrical, spherical or other types. For the superior characteristics, these 
switchable lenses can be employed in various optical fields. 

In geometrical optics, the modulation of a lens is attributed to the refraction of light at the lens 
surfaces.  However,  the  theory  of  wave  optics  suggests  that  it  is  caused  by  the  phase 
modulation. The refractive index of the glass or other transparent lens materials is larger than 
that of the surrounding air, which leads to the slowing down of wave front. For a convex lens, 
the slowing effect of light waves passing through the center of the lens is greater than that of 
the  light  waves  passing  through  both  sides  of  the  lens,  resulting  in  the  incident  light  wave 
convergence. On the contrary, a concave lens diverges the incident light. However, the focal 
length  of  a  conventional  lens  is  fixed.  Usually  we  need  to  adjust  the  optical  systems  by 
mechanical modulation or other methods [1].   
    Scientists have made much effort in realizing a lens with bifocus, which is very important 
in intraocular lens[2], 3D display[3], target tracking[4], and other fields[5]. It is even much more 
difficult  to  realize  a  lens  that  can  switch  between  convex  lens  functions  and  concave  lens 
functions  with  one  geometric  structure.  This  lens  can  be  widely  applied  in  tuning  of  3D 
real-images  and  virtual-images  in  AR  and  VR,  corresponding  to  long  depth  of  view  in  3D 
display. 
  [7], 
    This  switchable  device  may  be  realized  by  phase-change  materials,  such  as  In2Se3
[9], and GeSbTe[10] which can switch between crystalline and amorphous states, 
Bi2Te3
and the corresponding physical properties are different.[6] In this paper, we propose a series of 
concave/convex switchable lenses based on phase-change materials. When the phase-change 
material is in one state, the lens is a concave lens; and in the other state, it is a convex lens. 
    assuming  the  substrate  material  is  air  (n0=1).  Each  wave  zone  is  composed  of  two 
rectangular  stages  constructed  from  phase-change  material  with  different  heights.  Other 
structures  of  wave  zones  are  similar,  with  the  same  height  and  different  widths.  The  final 
result is shown in Figure 1a. Switched to concave/convex lens, all the rectangular structures 
in Figure 1a should be in the same state. 
    We then conduct simulations to verify the conversion effect of the structure in Figure 1a in

the x-z plane. The simulations are carried out using finite-difference time-domain solutions by 
Lumerical  Solutions. Starting  from  the  center  of  the  lens,  there  are  16  wave  zones  on  both 
sides.  The  heights  of  the  two  stages  in  each  wave  zone  are  λ/2,  3λ/2  respectively.  The 
phase-change  material  is  assumed  to  be  Ge3Sb2Te6.  The  simulated  incident  light  is  parallel 
light (λ=3.1 μm). The results are shown in figure 1b and c.   
    When  the  phase-change  material  is  in  amorphous  state  (n1=3.5+0.001i),  the  structure 
exhibits the function of a convex lens with a focal length f '=50 μm, as shown in Figure 1b. 
When the material is in crystalline state (n2=6.5+0.06i), as shown in Figure 1b, the lens reflect 
the light to one point. Due to the large refractive index, most of the incident light  energy is 
reflected or absorbed within the lens. The reflected light is convergent, indicating that the lens 
is a concave lens with a focal length f '= -50 μm. It is also seen from Figure 1b and c that the 
focusing of the light beam is not very satisfactory. One reason is that, we design the structure 
based  on  a  spherical  lens,  which  have  dispersion  and  other  aberrations.  On  the  other  hand, 
each wave zone has only two rectangular stages. If more stages in each wave zone are used, 
the accuracy of the lens can be improved.

    In conclusion, utilizing phase-change materials with excellent optical properties to change 
the  focal  length  of  the  lens,  a  series  of concave/convex  switchable  lenses  are  proposed.  To 
sum  up,  the  switchable  lenses  we  proposed  have  simple  structure  and  can  applied  to  large 
optical components, which are suitable for practical processing. Our next job is to put forward 
more  reasonable  lenses,  and  to  make  an  actual  lens  for practical  experiments.  However,  in 
order to produce a high-precision switchable lens, we need to further find suitable materials as 
the substrate mentioned in this article.
