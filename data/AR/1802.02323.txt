ABSTRACT
We analyse the spatial distribution of current helicity in solar active regions. A com-
parison of current helicity maps derived from three diﬀerent instruments (Helioseismic
and Magnetc Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, SDO/HMI, Spectro-
Polarimeter on board the Hinode, and Solar Magnetic Field Telescope at the Huairou
Solar Observing Station, China, HSOS/SMFT) is carried out. The comparison showed
an excellent correlation between the maps derived from the spaceborne instruments
and moderate correlation between the maps derived from SDO/HMI and HSOS/SMFT
vector magnetograms. The results suggest that the obtained maps characterize real
spatial distribution of current helicity over an active region. To analyse intermittency
of current helicity, we traditionally use the high-order structure functions and ﬂat-
ness function approach. The slope of a ﬂatness function within some range of scales –
the ﬂatness exponent – is a measure of the degree of intermittency. SDO/HMI vector
magnetograms for 3 ARs (NOAA 11158, 12494, and 12673) were used to calculate
the ﬂatness exponent time variations. All three ARs exhibited emergence of a new
magnetic ﬂux during the observational interval. The ﬂatness exponent indicated the
increase of intermittency 12–20 hours before the emergence of a new ﬂux. We suppose
that this behaviour can indicate subphotospheric fragmentation or distortion of the
pre-existed electric current system by emerging magnetic ﬂux.

1 INTRODUCTION

a relationship must hold (Seehafer 1994)

Kinetic and magnetic helicities play an important role in the
mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory (e.g. Parker 1979; Charbonneau
2005). In the framework of the theory, velocity v = hv i + v ′
and magnetic B = hBi+B ′ ﬁelds are split up into mean (hvi
and hBi) and ﬂuctuating (v ′ and B ′) parts. The induction
equation for the mean magnetic ﬁeld, hBi, can be written
as (e.g. Seehafer 1994):
∂hBi
∂t

= ∇ × (hv i × hBi) +η∆hB i + ∇ × E ,

(1)

where η is the magnetic diﬀusivity constant and E is the
mean electromotive force caused by the ﬂuctuations:

E = hv ′ × B ′i.

(2)

Under a set of assumptions, supposing that i) the spatial
scales of the mean and ﬂuctuating parts of ﬁelds can be sep-
arated and ii) the ﬂuctuations are statistically homogeneous,

with α denoting some scalar or pseudo-tensor. The elec-
tromotive force can be the only source of the mean-ﬁeld
magnetic energy increase (Seehafer 1994). Expression (3)
describes the so-called alpha eﬀect that requires a non-
vanishing kinetic helicity (Seehafer 1990). It is assumed that
the Coriolis eﬀect can be responsible for the generation of
helicity. Since the Coriolis eﬀect produces helical motions of
opposite direction in the northern and in the southern hemi-
spheres, a certain helicity sign must prevail in the northern
hemisphere and the opposite sign must prevail in the south-
ern hemisphere. Unfortunately, neither kinetic nor magnetic
helicity are available for direct observations. Nevertheless,
one can adopt current helicity, HC, as a proxy of magnetic
helicity: current and magnetic helicities have the same sign
and they increase simultaneously (Seehafer 1990).

The hemispheric current helicity sign rule was estab-
lished in the pioneering work by Seehafer (1990). He anal-
ysed the curvature of ﬁbrils in the vicinity of 16 active re-

Majority of works regard current helicity as some
integral characteristic of an AR and focuses on its sign (e.g.

that the current helicity elements have a characteristic
size of order 10 Mm and characteristic lifetime of order 27
hours. In this paper, we focus on the spatial distribution
of current helicity over ARs and, for the ﬁrst time to our
knowledge, on its intermittency.

2 DATA

In this study, we used vector magnetic ﬁeld obtained by three
instruments. The ﬁrst instrument is the space-based Helio-
seismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO/HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al.
2012). SDO/HMI is a ﬁltergraph that observes the solar disk
at the Fe i 6173 ˚A photosphere spectral line. The spatial res-
olution of the instrument is 1′′ with 0.5′′ pixel size (Liu et al.
2012). Continuous set of the HMI magnetic ﬁeld data with a
cadence of 720 s is available since May 2010. The vector mag-
netograms are publicly available as full-disk 4096×4096 pixel
maps. Alternatively, the data are provided in the form of
the Space-Weather HMI Active Regions Patches (SHARPs,
Bobra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2014). The SHARP data
contain vector magnetic ﬁeld maps of ARs automatically
identiﬁed by a sophisticated algorithm (Turmon et al. 2010).
ARs are tracked for its entire lifetime as they pass the solar
disk. The 180-degree ambiguity in the transverse component
of the HMI magnetic ﬁeld vector is resolved using a mini-
mum energy method (Metcalf 1994; Leka et al. 2009). In this
study, we used deﬁnitive hmi.shar p720s data series.

The second instrument we used is the space-based Solar
Optical Telescope Spectro-Polaimeter (SOT-SP, Lites et al.
2013) on board the joint Japanese/US/UK space mission

Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007). Hinode/SOT-SP provides mea-
surements of all four Stokes parameters measured at the Fe i
6302 ˚A lines. Only a one-dimensional slice of the solar sur-
face is recorded at a time so the map of a certain region
is obtained as a set of consecutive slices. Four operational
modes are available. In Normal Mode the instrument can
obtain a 1024×1024 pixel map of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
of ARs with 0.15′′×0.16′′ pixel size during approximately
90 minutes. In Fast Map Mode the binning of the neigh-
bouring pixels is performed resulting in 0.30′′×0.32′′ spatial
samplings. It takes 30 minutes to acquire the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld map of an AR with 151′′×162′′ size (Lites et al.
2013). We used Hinode/SOT-SP Level2 data that are out-
puts from MERLIN spectral line inversion code (Lites et al.
2007). Each Level2 dataset is stored in a FITS ﬁle and
contains 42 extensions. The ﬁrst three extensions are maps
of magnetic ﬁeld strength, inclination, and azimuth angles.
To resolve the 180-degree ambiguity in the Hinode/SOT-SP
vector magnetic ﬁeld data we applied the new disambigua-
tion code developed by Rudenko and Anﬁnogentov (2014).
The third instrument we used is the ground-based So-
lar Magnetic Field Telescope (SMFT) at the Huairou Solar
Observing Station (HSOS), National Astronomical Observa-
tories of China. The SMFT is equipped with a birefringent
ﬁlter for wavelength selection and KDP crystals to modulate
polarization signals. The Fe i 5324.19 ˚A spectral line is used
at the HSOS vector magnetograph. A vector magnetogram is
built using four narrow-band (0.125 ˚A) ﬁltergrams of Stokes
I, Q, U, and V parameters. The centre wavelength of the ﬁl-
ter can be shifted and is normally at -0.075 ˚A from the line
centre for the measurements of longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
and at the line centre for the transversal magnetic ﬁelds
(Ai and Hu 1986). The instrument has been observing vec-
tor magnetic ﬁelds for nearly 30 years. Three diﬀerent CCD
cameras have been used: prior to December 2001, observa-
tions were taken with a 512×512 pixel CCD with the eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld of view of 5.23′×3.63′. Between 2002 and 2008, a
detector was replaced to 640×480 pixel CCD with the eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld of view of 3.75′×2.81′. After 2009, a 992×992 pixel
CCD is used, the eﬀective ﬁeld of view is 4′×3.5′, resulting
in a pixel size of about 0.30′′×0.29′′. The weak-ﬁeld approx-
imation is used to reconstruct the vector magnetogram, the
relationship between the magnetic ﬁeld and the Stokes pa-
rameters I, Q, U, and V is as following:

Bl = Cl(V /I),
Bt = Ct[(Q/I)2 + (U/I)2],
φ = 0.5 tan -1(U/Q)

(6)

where Cl and Ct are the calibration coeﬃcients for the
longitudinal Bl and transverse Bt magnetic ﬁeld, respec-
tively, φ is the azimuth angle. For more detailed description
of SMFT calibration, see e.g. Wang, Ai, and Deng (1996);
Su and Zhang (2004); Bai et al. (2014).

3 METHODS

3.1 Current helicity

Using the full-vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements at a single
height in the photosphere, we can calculate only a z-related

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2018)

part of current helicity:

HCz = Bz jz

where jz is the z-part of electric current density
jz = [∇ × B ]z

(7)

(8)

Throughout this article, we will refer to HCz as cur-
rent helicity, HC. Using the Stokes’ theorem and following
Abramenko, Wang, and Yurchishin (1996), we can rewrite
(8) in the following form:

jz =

IL

B tdr

(9)

where B t is the vector of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld.
The integration was performed by Simpson’s formula over
the contour L enclosed an area of n × n pixels around
the central point where the z-part of the electric current
jz was determined. Electric currents obtained by equa-
tion (9) are in a good agreement with that obtained by a
traditional diﬀerential formula with subsequent smoothing
(Abramenko, Wang, and Yurchishin 1996). In addition, the
current helicity map of AR NOAA 11158 in Figure 1 is in an
excellent visual agreement with almost co-temporary map in
ﬁg. 1 in Zhang, Brandenburg, and Sokoloﬀ (2016).

3.2 Intermittency spectra

Within the next sections, we analyse the intermittency of
current helicity and magnetic ﬁelds distributions over ARs.
We use the high-order structure function approach (e.g.
Frisch 1995; ( 2002); Abramenko 2005).

Structure functions were introduced by Kolmogorov
(1941, 1991) and they represent the statistical moments of
the q-powers of the increment of any two-dimensional (in
our case) ﬁeld u(r ):
Sq(r ) = h|u(x + r ) − u(x )|qi
(10)
Here x is each point of the analysed ﬁeld and r is the sep-
aration vector between the points used to measure the in-
crement. The order of a statistical moment q can take real
values. The angular brackets in equation (10) denote aver-
aging over the whole ﬁeld map. More detailed description of
the calculation procedure and of the Sq(r ) function proper-
ties can be found in ( (2002)).

At the next step we are to determine the scale range
where Sq(r ) function is linear and the analysed ﬁeld is in-
termittent. To do this, we calculate the hyper-ﬂatness func-
tion determined as the ratio of the sixth statistical moment
to the cube of the second statistical moment (Abramenko
2005):
F(r ) = S6(r )/(S2(r ))3 ∼ r -κ

(11)
For an intermittent ﬁeld, F(r ) changes as a power law
of the scale r . In a double logarithmic plot of F(r ) versus
r , the slope κ of the hyper-ﬂatness function, determined
within some scale range ∆r where F(r ) is linear, character-
izes the intermittency of the ﬁeld: the higher the slope the
higher the complexity of the spatial structure of the ana-
lyzed ﬁeld (Abramenko 2005). For simplicity, we will refer
to F(r ) and κ as the ﬂatness function and the ﬂatness expo-
nent, respectively, while the subscript will denote the anal-
ysed two-dimensional ﬁeld (for example, κHC for the ﬂatness
exponent of the current helicity map).

Intermittency spectra of current helicity

3

Intermittency implies a tendency of a physical en-
tity to concentrate into small-scale features of high inten-
sity surrounded by extended areas of less intense ﬂuctua-
tions and manifests itself via burst-like behaviour in tem-
poral and spatial domains. Large ﬂuctuations in an inter-
mittent process are not as rare as in the Gaussian pro-
cess, and they contribute signiﬁcantly into the statistical
moments, that leads to multifractality (see, e.g., Frisch
1995, for more details). Thus, by analysing multifractality
of a structure, we also explore its intermittency. Generally
speaking, intermittency and multifractality are two diﬀer-
ent terms of the same phenomenon. Historically, the term
’intermittency’ is usually applied to time series analysis,
whereas the term multifractality is used for spatial objects.
In Abramenko and Yurchyshyn (2010) it was shown that the
classical spectrum of multifractality f (α) versus the singu-
larity exponent α can be derived from structure functions
of a set of statistical moments, q. One of the reasons to
use the aforementioned ﬂatness function technique instead
of the classical method is the fact that the ﬂatness func-
tions clearly reveal the scale interval, ∆r , where intermit-
tency/multifractality holds (which is not the case of sophis-
ticated singularity exponent), and besides that, the slope of
the ﬂatness function allows us a numerical estimate of the
degree of intermittency (which is also a challenge when using
the f (α) method).

4 COMPARISON OF CURRENT HELICITY

MAPS FROM DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS

As it was mentioned above, majority of researchers re-
gard current helicity as some integral characteristic of
an AR, i.e. they examine the current helicity imbalance
over a map, predominant sign, mean value, etc (Seehafer
1990; Zhang et al. 2010; Abramenko, Wang, and Yurchishin
1996). In this work, we are interested in studying the spa-
tial structure of current helicity maps. The z -related part of
current helicity is obtained as a result of several mathemat-
ical operations applied to the magnetic ﬁeld vector data. In
addition to the magnetic ﬁeld measurements uncertainties,
which are especially high for the transverse magnetic ﬁeld,
the accuracy of the HC map depends on the magnetic ﬁeld
pre-processing (especially the 180◦ disambiguation routine)
and on the computational procedures used to calculate HC.
So, the ﬁrst question is how reliable the derived current helic-
ity map is? To address this question, we made a comparison
of current helicity maps derived from diﬀerent instruments.
We compared the HC maps from two space-borne in-
struments, namely SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP. Vector
magnetograms of AR NOAA 11158 on 2011 February 13
were chosen for calculations of HC (Fig. 1). The square con-
tour of the integral (9) was set to 5×5 pixels for SDO/HMI
data and to 9×9 pixels for Hinode/SOT-SP data, imply-
ing equal sampling contours of 2.5′′×2.5′′on the solar sur-
face. The Hinode/SOT-SP HC map was rescaled to the
SDO/HMI pixel size by an IDL CONGRID function. Then
the two maps were co-aligned and cropped to achieve the
same ﬁeld-of-view. At the last step of data reduction, the HC
maps were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a width
of 2.5′′.

Hinode/SOT-SP and their comparison are shown in Fig. 1.
One can see an excellent visual agreement between the im-
ages, the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient between the maps
is 0.86.

We also compared the HC maps derived from SDO/HMI
and from the ground-based HSOS/SMFT instrument. We
chose a simple bipolar AR NOAA 12266 observed on 2015
January 19 (Fig. 2). In this case, the square contour was
set to 9×9 pixels for SDO/HMI magnetograms and to
15×15 pixels for HSOS/SMFT data, resulting in contour
side length of 4.5′′. This value is consistent with the spa-
tial resolution of the ground-based HSOS/SMFT (Bai et al.
2014). Before rescaling to the pixel size of SDO/HMI, the
HSOS/SMFT HC map was rotated by approximately 6.5◦
by an IDL ROT function in order to coalign the y-axis of
the HSOS/SMFT HC map and the rotation axis of the Sun.
This angle was derived from the SUNPARAM procedure (a
part of Yohkoh SolarSoft packages) for the date of observa-
tion. Finally, the HC images were smoothed with 3.5′′ width
Gaussian kernel. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Although
the spatial structure of the HC maps are similar, the visual
agreement is worse than in the previous case. The Pearson’s
R equals 0.54 suggesting moderate correlation between the
data.

Compared to ground-based instruments, space-borne
instruments have usually higher resolution and they are not
aﬀected by seeing. These factors probably cause diﬀerent
results in the vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements. This dif-
ference can also be found in the calculated distribution of
current helicity (see also Xu et al. 2016). There is no way
to completely eliminate this discrepancy by data reduction.
The comparison of space-borne and ground-based instru-
ments is worth studying in depth and we plan to carry out
such an analysis in forthcoming works.

We emphasize that all the instruments use diﬀerent
technique to measure magnetic ﬁeld and diﬀerent inver-

sion procedures. Nevertheless, the current helicity maps
are quite similar, especially for the space-borne instru-
ments. Moderate agreement between the SDO/HMI and
HSOS/SMFT HC maps can be explained by high uncertain-
ties of the transversal magnetic ﬁeld measurements in the
HSOS/SMFT data due to seeing and, possibly, some system-
atic errors (Otsuji, Sakurai, and Kuzanyan 2015). There-
fore, we can conclude that the obtained HC maps repre-
sent real spatial distribution of current helicity over ac-
tive regions and the inﬂuence of measurement noise or
instrumental data contamination is not signiﬁcant (cf.
Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Metcalf 1994). Therefore, we can use
the obtained maps to analyse the multifractal structures of
current helicity.

5 RESULTS

We analysed the ﬂatness functions and the variations of ﬂat-
ness exponent of current helicity maps of three ARs, namely
NOAA 11158, 12494, 12673. In this part of our study, we
used the vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI only. The
ARs were tracked during 5–6 days when they were located
less than ±30◦ from the central meridian. By this reason,
we did not apply any deprojection procedures to the mag-
netic ﬁeld data. We used the deﬁnitive hmi.sharp720s series
(Hoeksema et al. 2014; Bobra et al. 2014), containing the
data on magnetic ﬁeld strength, inclination, and azimuth.
The transversal and longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds were cal-
culated under assumption that the z-axis coincides with the
line-of-sight. The integration contour in equation (9) was set
to 5×5 pixels corresponding to 2.5′′ or approximately 2 Mm
contour side length. Before the ﬂatness function calculation,
current helicity maps were smoothed with a 5-pixel width
Gaussian kernel.

We found that the linear size of the current helicity

SDO/HMI and from -200 Mx cm-2 to 200 Mx cm-2 for HSOS/SMFT. Red arrows indicates the direction of the transversal magnetic

structures rarely exceeded 10 Mm that is in a good agree-
ment with the results by Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Metcalf
(1994) regarding the size of the current helicity elements size.
Structures with a linear size less than 2 Mm are smaller than
the integration contour and are not reliable for the analysis.
That is why the ﬂatness exponent κHC was calculated as a
linear ﬁt to the ﬂatness function of the current helicity map
within the scale range 2–10 Mm (Fig. 3).

Typical ﬂatness functions derived from the current he-
licity maps of all three ARs considered in this work are
shown in Fig. 3. One can see that the curves have almost
the same slope in the scale range 10–40 Mm implying sim-
ilar structural complexity at these scales. On the contrary,
the slopes in the scale range 2–10 Mm diﬀer signiﬁcantly
suggesting quite diﬀerent intermittency of small scale cur-
rent helicity elements at diﬀerent moments. Saturation of the
ﬂatness functions below 2 Mm is caused by artiﬁcial smooth-
ing of the current helicity maps at low scales (cf. ﬁg. 8 in
Abramenko and Yurchyshyn 2010).

In addition to the current helicity ﬂatness exponent,
we analysed variations of i) the total unsigned ﬂux of an
AR, ii) the ﬂatness exponents of longitudinal and transver-
sal magnetic ﬁelds, iii) net current helicity of an AR. The
total unsigned ﬂux data were retrieved from the headers
of the magnetogram FITS ﬁles (Bobra et al. 2014). The
ﬂatness exponents of the longitudinal (κBz ) and the mod-
ulus of the transversal (κBt ) magnetic ﬁelds were deter-
mined as a linear ﬁt to the ﬂatness function calculated
from corresponding magnetic ﬁeld maps within the scale
range of 5–40 Mm. In the most of the cases, the ﬂat-
ness function of the magnetic ﬁeld saturated at 5 Mm (see
ﬁg. 5 in Abramenko and Yurchyshyn 2010). The eﬀect is
caused by relatively high noise of the vector magnetograms
(Abramenko and Yurchyshyn 2010). The upper boundary of
40 Mm corresponds to a linear size of the largest spots. Net

current helicity was calculated as a sum of current helicity
in pixels over the entire map.

5.1 Active region NOAA 11158

AR NOAA 11158 started to emerge in the southern hemi-
sphere on 2011 February 10 as two simple magnetic dipoles
that gradually formed a quadrupole magnetic structure. By
the beginning of 2011 February 12, the total magnetic ﬂux
of the AR reached the value of 5×1021 Mx and stayed un-
changed until 2011 February 12 17:00 UT. After that, a new
intensive emergence started and continued for at least two
days (Fig 4a). The total magnetic ﬂux of the AR reached
almost 3×1022 Mx by the end of 2011 February 15.

We tracked the AR NOAA 11158 during 5 days from
2011 February 12 to February 16. In total, 600 sets of vec-
tor magnetograms were used in the analysis. Variations of
the ﬂatness exponent of current helicity κHC are shown in
Fig. 4b. One can see an abrupt dip of the ﬂatness expo-
nent down to values of -1.4 approximately 12 hours before
the start of a new magnetic ﬂux emergence on 2011 Febru-
ary 12 at 17:00 UT. Just before the emergence, the ﬂatness
exponent of current helicity restored its initial values and
varied in the range from -0.1 to -1.0 up to the end of the
observations. The current helicity ﬂatness functions plotted
in Fig. 3a were obtained at the moments denoted by vertical
dashed lines in Fig. 4b.

Note that both ﬂatness function curves in Fig. 3a have
almost the same slope within the scale range above 10 Mm.
We found that this slope remains quasi-constant. This im-
plies that, within this range, the intermittency of current
helicity remains unchanged.

Flatness exponents of longitudinal, κBz , and of mod-
ulus of transversal, κBt , magnetic ﬁelds are also shown in
Fig. 4c. Interestingly, before the onset of new emergence

(indicated by grey dashed lines). The ﬂatness functions were calculated for the time moments indicated by dashed grey lines in panels b
of Figs. 4,5, and 6.

both curves show low absolute values of the exponent, about
0.5, and vary slightly. Unlike the κHC behaviour, a signiﬁ-
cant increase of |κBz | and |κBt | is observed synchronously
with the increase of the total magnetic ﬂux. Note also that
the increase of |κBz | precedes M- and X-class ﬂare events on
2011 February 14 17:28 UT (M6.6) and on 2011 February
15 01:44 UT (X2.2). This is consistent with the results by
Abramenko and Yurchyshyn (2010): an increase of absolute
κBz in ARs is often followed by strong ﬂare events.

The net current helicity variations of the AR calculated
using equation (9) are plotted in Fig. 4d. Before the onset
of a new ﬂux emergence, the net current helicity ﬂuctuated
around zero values, implying the helicity balance. After the
emergence onset, the helicity balance changed rapidly and
positive helicity started to prevail obeying the hemispheric
sign rule for current helicity. The net current helicity re-
trieved from the headers of FITS ﬁle is overplotted in panel
d of Fig. 4 in red colour. The curve was rescaled and arti-
ﬁcially shifted down to visualize a good agreement between
the net current helicity obtained by diﬀerential and integral
formulae.

5.2 Active region NOAA 12494

An AR NOAA 12494 started to emerge on 2016 February
03 and exhibited the total magnetic ﬂux of approximately
1.1×1022 Mx by the beginning of 2016 February 05 (Fig. 5a).
The AR had the well-formed leading and following spots that
made up a simple magnetic dipole and a pore-like mixed-
polarity magnetic structures between the main sunspots.
During the development of the AR, the leading spot was
more fragmented than the following one. The AR started
to decay at about 00:00 UT on 2016 February 05. The de-
cay was interrupted by a new growth of the total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux. Visual inspection of the AR magnetograms
reveals an emergence of a new magnetic dipole in a close
vicinity of the following spot. This event probably caused a
quick elongation and fragmentation of the following spot.

Similar to the previous case, a rapid increase of the mod-
ulus of the current helicity ﬂatness exponent was observed

approximately 12 hours before the onset of a new ﬂux emer-
gence (Fig. 5b, a blue arrow): κHC reached the value of -1.4
for a short time interval and then restored its initial value
of about -0.5. Note that the ﬂatness exponent of the lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁeld remains low during the entire ob-
servational interval. The ﬂatness exponent of the modulus
of the transversal magnetic ﬁelds neither reﬂects the pre-
emergence variations of κHC . This AR, being located at the
southern hemisphere, also obeyed the hemispheric sign rule
for current helicity.

5.3 Active region NOAA 12673

AR NOAA 12673 was one of the most interesting AR of cy-
cle 24. The AR appeared at the eastern limb as a simple
unipolar decaying positive-polarity spot of approximately
3×1021 Mx on 2017 August 29. We tracked the AR for 5 days
since 2017 September 01 00:00 UT. As the AR moved west-
ward, a new magnetic ﬂux started to emerge southeast of
the spot on 2017 September 02. The ﬂux emergence rate was
greater than any value ever reported so far (Sun and Norton
2017). Two bipolar emerging regions formed a complex
quasi-circular topological system (Yang et al. 2017). The
AR produced a series of X-class ﬂares one of which (X9.3
SOL2017-09-06T11:53) was the strongest event since 2005
(Sun and Norton 2017). One can see in Fig. 6c that the AR
displayed the signiﬁcant increase of the intermittency of lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁeld prior to the ﬁrst strong ﬂare event.
By the end of 2017 September 07, the total unsigned ﬂux of
the AR increased up to 6×1022 Mx.

Although the ﬂatness exponent of current helicity had
on average higher value than in previous two cases, the same
tendency is observed: the κHC curve exhibits an abrupt dip
15–20 hours before the start of new emergence (Fig. 6a, b).
Again, neither ﬂatness exponents of magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nents nor net helicity display any signiﬁcant changes at the
moment when the dip occurs (Fig. 6b, c).

Interestingly, although the AR emerged at the southern
hemisphere, its net current helicity was negative, i.e. the AR
violated the current helicity hemispheric sign rule.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In this article, we analysed intermittency of the z-related
part of current helicity in solar active regions. First of all,
we made a comparison of current helicity maps derived from
diﬀerent instruments. We concluded that the maps predomi-
nantly represent persistent pattern of current helicity rather
than random structures.

We used the high-order structure functions approach to
obtain the intermittency (or multifractality) spectra – the
ﬂatness functions – of current helicity maps. The variations
of the slope of ﬂatness functions – the ﬂatness exponent κHC

determined for the scale range of 2–10 Mm – were scruti-
nized. This parameter is the measure of intermittency of
current helicity. In addition, we analysed the co-temporary
variations of the ﬂatness exponents of longitudinal and of the
modulus of transversal magnetic ﬁelds as well as changes in
the net current helicity and in the total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux of ARs.

Three ARs NOAA 11158, 12494, and 12673 were stud-
ied. Two of them, namely NOAA 11158 and 12494, obeyed
the hemispheric rule for net current helicity sign while
AR NOAA 12673 violated the rule. It is worth noting
that two ARs of high-ﬂaring activity (NOAA 11158 and
12673) exhibited rapid increase of intermittency of longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld prior to a series of strong ﬂares,
while intermittency of longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld of the low-
ﬂaring AR NOAA 12494 remained at a relatively low level.
This ﬁnding is in a general agreement with the results by
Abramenko and Yurchyshyn (2010).

All the ARs had a common feature in their evolution-
ary behaviour: during the observational interval, emergence

of a new magnetic ﬂux has been observed in a close vicinity
of the pre-existing magnetic structures. In all three cases,
we observed an abrupt dip in the current helicity ﬂatness
exponent κHC time proﬁle approximately 12 hours prior to
the emergence onset. This result resembles the ﬁndings by
Singh, Raichur, and Brandenburg (2016), who analysed the
distribution of line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld within patches
that enclosed emerging AR. They found that the kurtosis,
i.e. the fourth statistical moment, of magnetic ﬁeld increases
prior to the formation of AR. In our opinion, the eﬀect is
caused by small-scale strong magnetic features that appear
at the photosphere during the ﬁrst stages of AR emergence
(e.g. Zwaan 1985; Lites, Skumanich, and Martinez Pillet
1998). These features might make the magnetic ﬁeld dis-
tribution more heavy-tailed leading to the kurtosis increase.
In this work, we also did ﬁnd changes in the ratio of the
statistical moments of current helicity – a quantity de-
rived from the magnetic ﬁeld. However, unlike to results
by Singh, Raichur, and Brandenburg (2016), we found pre-
emergence changes in the structure of electric currents rather

than in its value. Note also that these structural changes take
place before any signatures of new emerging ﬂux appear at
the solar surface, i.e. they might reﬂect the subphotospheric
dynamics of magnetic ﬁelds.

The observed decrease in the ﬂatness exponent value
from, say, -0.5 to -1.5, means the steepening of the intermit-
tency spectrum, and, therefore, the increase of complexity
(Abramenko 2005). We may propose the following qualita-
tive explanation of this phenomenon. Current helicity is a
product of electric current density and magnetic ﬁeld. In
absence of any disturbances, magnetic ﬁelds exhibit gradual
long-term evolution of their spatial structure while electric
currents are changing more rapidly. From the formal point of
view, a current helicity map represents the electric current
distribution weighted by the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude (here
we do not take into account the sign of the magnetic ﬁeld).
In other words, the current helicity structure replicates the
fast-changing structure of electric currents inside regions of
quasi-uniform magnetic ﬁeld.

The increase of the modulus of the HC ﬂatness func-
tion slope within some scale range implies an increase of
the complexity and intermittency of current helicity at these
scales. We suppose that the observed dip in the current helic-
ity ﬂatness exponent curve can be explained by changing of
topology of electric currents, namely by fragmentation and
realignment of current structures. This fragmentation might
be caused by disturbances produced by emerging magnetic
ﬂux as it lifts through the convection zone. The simplest
physical explanation for such disturbances might be an ex-
citation of near-surface inductive currents as the subphoto-
spheric magnetic setup changes. More generally, we suppose
that the changes of electric current system precede the ﬂux
emergence.

If our reasoning is correct, we can make two important
conclusions. First, the vertical electric currents observed at
the photosphere level extend into the convection zone. Sec-
ond, the rapid changes in the distribution of electric currents
can be used as a tool for prediction of a new magnetic ﬂux
emergence.
