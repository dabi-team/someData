SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

Abstract. The Defect Recollement, Restriction Recollement, Auslander-
Gruson-Jensen Recollement, and others, are shown to be instances of
a general construction using derived functors and methods from stable
)∗ are computed
module theory. The right derived functors Wk := Rk(
)∗ is right exact and re-
and it is shown that the functor W2 := R2(
stricts to a duality W of the defect zero functors. The duality W satisﬁes
two identities which we call the Generalised Auslander-Reiten formulas.
We show that W restricts to the generalised Auslander-Bridger trans-
pose and show that the Generalised Auslander-Reiten formulas reduce
to the well-known Auslander-Reiten formulas.

1. Introduction

In [8], the authors studied the Auslander-Gruson-Jenson functor

DA : fp(Mod(R), Ab) −→ (mod(Rop), Ab)
which is an exact contravariant functor sending representable functors (M,
to tensor functors M ⊗ , showing that the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen func-
tor admits both a left and right adjoint, thus establishing that DA is part
of a recollement called the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen recollement.
In this
paper, we streamline and generalise the proof of these assertions.

)

In [15], Krause shows that for a ﬁnitely accessible category A, the restric-

tion functor

R : fp(Aop, Ab) −→ ((fpA)op, Ab)
admits two adjoints. In the case that A = Mod(R), then the description of
the both kernels of DA and R is the full subcategory of functors arising from
pure exact sequences in Mod(R). The goal of this paper is to fully explain
1

the connection between the functors DA and R, both by realizing them as
pieces of a more general construction, and giving a relationship between
them which explains why they have dual kernels. The main contributions
of the paper are the following.

Theorem (Derived Recollement Theorem). Suppose that C, D are both
abelian categories with enough projectives and we have an adjunction

C

λ

ρ

D

Assume that

(1) For any projective P ∈ C there is some object D ∈ D such that

P ∼= ρ(D).

(2) ρ sends projectives to projectives.

If the adjunction λ ⊣ ρ is also reﬂective, meaning that ρ is fully faithful,
then it can be extended to a recollement

Ker(λ)

iL

i

iR

C

L0ρ

λ

ρ

D

where L0ρ is the zeroth left derived functor. In particular, λ is exact.

We apply this result to produce various examples of recollements. One
of our examples occurs if C is a ﬁnite k-variety with weak kernels and weak
cokernels such that mod(C) is a dualising k-variety. In this case we show that
C is also a dualising k-variety. This generalises [5, Proposition 2.5]. We also
show that our motivating examples, namely the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen
functor DA and the Restriction functor R, are both localization functors
appearing in derived recollements.

Our focus then shifts to fully understanding the connection between these

two recollements. This is ultimately achieved by looking at the functors

This theorem is then applied to recover two formulas that look strikingly
similar to the Auslander-Reiten formulas. At the end of the paper, we prove
that they do in fact reduce to the original Auslander-Reiten formulas.

is abelian category with enough projectives and injectives. Then we have

These two formulas allow us to achieve our ultimate goal of understanding
how the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen Recollement and Restriction Recollement
relate to each other. The duality W together with the localization properties
of DA and R are used to show the following.

Theorem. The duality W induces a duality T making the following diagram
of functors commute.

SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

The duality T is isomorphic to the generalized Auslander-Bridger transpose
Tr∗ studied by Herzog in [14]. Hence the duality Tr∗ can be recovered via a
universal property.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we recall the functor
categories fp(A, Ab) and (mod(Rop), Ab) and describe some of their well
known properties. The category fp(A, Ab) is the category of the ﬁnitely
presented functors F : A → Ab together with the natural transformations
between them. A functor F is ﬁnitely presented if there exists an exact
sequence

)

)

The Yoneda embedding Y : A −→ fp(A, Ab) is the fully faithful contravari-
ant functor deﬁned by Y(X) = (X,
In [1], Auslander constructs an
exact contravariant functor w : fp(A, Ab) −→ A satisfying the property that
) ∼= X. He further shows that the defect is an adjoint to the Yoneda
w(X,
embedding. For each ﬁnitely presented functor he constructs a four-term
exact sequence called the defect sequence:

(cid:1)

The category (mod(Rop), Ab) consists of all functors F : mod(Rop) → Ab
together with the natural transformations between them. The tensor em-
bedding is the fully faithful right exact functor t : Mod(R) → (mod(Rop), Ab)
given by t(M ) = M ⊗ . In [13], Gruson and Jensen show that evaluation
at the ring

evR : (mod(Rop), Ab) −→ Mod(R)

is the right adjoint to t.

The Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor is the functor

DA : fp(Mod(R), Ab) → (mod(Rop), Ab)

deﬁned by

DA := R0(t ◦ w)

An alternate description of DA is given by its exactness and the fact that it
) to the tensor functor X ⊗ . The functor
sends any representable (X,
DA was studied by the authors in [8] where it is shown to have both adjoints.
Finally, the deﬁnition of the the stable categories A and A are reviewed
at the end of the section. The category A is the quotient category obtained
by factoring out the ideal of all morphisms in A which factor through a
projective. These categories will be used later on in the paper and so we
have brieﬂy included their deﬁnitions.

In Section 3, we introduce recollements. A recollement is a diagram of

functors between abelian categories A, B, C,

where iL ⊣ i ⊣ iR, fL ⊣ f ⊣ fR, the functors i, fL and fR are fully faithful,
and the essential image of i is the kernel of f . We generalise Auslander’s
method for constructing the defect sequence in [1]. We introduce reﬂective
and coreﬂective adjunctions. A reﬂective (respectively, coreﬂective) adjunc-
tion is an adjoint pair λ ⊣ ρ where ρ (respectively, λ) is fully faithful, and
explain that any localisation of abelian categories (i.e. an exact functor λ
which is part of a reﬂective adjunction λ ⊣ ρ) is a Serre localisation. We
then prove one of our main results: That any reﬂective adjunction λ ⊣ ρ
where ρ which maps projectives to projectives and maps at least one object
onto every projective is part of a recollement µ = L0ρ ⊣ λ ⊣ ρ. We call this
result the Derived Recollement Theorem.

In Section 4, we introduce the notion of a derived recollement. This is
simply a recollement gotten by an application of the Derived Recollement
Theorem. We then give several examples:

(1) If A is abelian and has enough projectives then there is a recollement

appearing in the defect sequence. In fact, this isomorphism is natural in F
and hence we have the following.
Proposition. W2 ◦ W2 ∼= (

We then show that the restriction of W2 yields a duality of the defect
zero functors. At that point we derive the Generalised Auslander-Reiten
formulas. We next use the localization properties of the functors DA and
R to recover the duality T ∼= Tr∗. We end by showing how to recover the
Auslander-Reiten formulas from the Generalised Auslander-Reiten formulas.

2. Functor Categories and The Defect

This section is a quick review. For more details, see [1, 4] and [17].

Throughout this entire paper:

(1) The word functor will always mean additive functor.
(2) The category of right modules will be denoted by Mod(R) and the

category of ﬁnitely presented right modules will be denoted by mod(R).

(3) Every left R-module can be viewed as a right module over the op-

posite ring Rop.

(4) The category of abelian groups will be denoted by Ab.
(5) The category A will always denote an abelian category.

2.1. Finitely Presented Functors. A functor F : A −→ Ab is called
representable if it is isomorphic to HomA(X,
) for some X ∈ A. We
will abbreviate the representable functors by (X,
). The most important
property of representable functors is the following well known lemma of
Yoneda:

Lemma 1 (Yoneda). For any covariant functor F : A → Ab and any X ∈ A,
there is an isomorphism:

Nat

(X,

), F

∼= F (X)

given by α 7→ αX (1X ). The isomorphism is natural in both F and X.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

An immediate consequence of the Yoneda lemma is that for any X, Y ∈ A,
∼= (X, Y ). Hence all natural transformations between

representable functors come from morphisms between objects in A.

(Y,

)
(cid:1)

Deﬁnition 1 (Auslander). A functor F : A → Ab is called ﬁnitely pre-
sented if there exists a sequence of natural transformations

(Y,

)

(X,

)

F

0

such that for any A ∈ A, the sequence of abelian groups

(Y, A)

(X, A)

F (A)

is exact.

One easily shows that if F is ﬁnitely presented, then the collection of
natural transformations Nat(F, G) for any functor G : A −→ Ab is actually
an abelian group. As such, one may form a category whose objects are the
covariant ﬁnitely presented functors F : A −→ Ab and whose morphisms are
the natural transformations between two such functors. This category is
denoted by fp(A, Ab) and was studied extensively by Auslander in multiple
works.

Theorem 2 (Auslander, [1], Theorem 2.3). The category fp(A, Ab) consist-
ing of all ﬁnitely presented functors together with the natural transforma-
tions between them satisﬁes the following properties:

(1) fp(A, Ab) is abelian. A sequence of ﬁnitely presented functors

F −→ G −→ H

is exact if and only if for every A ∈ A the sequence of abelian groups

F (A) −→ G(A) −→ H(A)

is exact.

(2) The projective objects of fp(A, Ab) are exactly the representables.
(3) Every ﬁnitely presented functor F ∈ fp(A, Ab) has a projective res-

olution of the form

0 −→ (Z,

) −→ (Y,

) −→ (X,

) −→ F −→ 0

DERIVED RECOLLEMENTS AND GENERALISED AR FORMULAS

The category fp(A, Ab) also has enough injectives whenever A has enough

projectives. This was shown by Gentle and he completely classiﬁed them.

Proposition 3 (Gentle, [12]). The category fp(A, Ab) has enough injectives
whenever A has enough projectives. A functor F : A −→ Ab is an injective
object in fp(A, Ab) if and only if there are projectives P, Q ∈ A such that
there exists an exact sequence

(Q,

) → (P,

) → F → 0

2.2. The Yoneda Embedding and the Defect. The contravariant func-
tor Y : A −→ fp(A, Ab) given by Y(X) := (X,
) is a contravariant left
exact embedding commonly referred to as the Yoneda embedding. At
this point we will explicitly recall the construction of the defect func-
tor w : fp(A, Ab) → A, originally introduced by Auslander in [1]. Let
F ∈ fp(A, Ab) and let

11

The morphism ϕ in the defect sequence is the unit of adjunction and w(ϕ)
is an isomorphism. The functor w is exact and wY ∼= 1A.

Because the defect w is an exact functor, its kernel, that is the full sub-
category of fp(A, Ab) consisting of all functors F for which w(F ) = 0, is a
Serre subcategory of fp(A, Ab). We will denote this category by both Ker(w)
and by fp0(A, Ab) depending on the situation. Auslander studied fp0(A, Ab)
in [1] and established a list of properties which we will be useful for certain
portions of our discussion.

Lemma 5 (Auslander, [1], Lemma 4.1, Lemma 4.2). If A has enough pro-
jectives, then the following properties hold.
(1) All extension functors Ext1(A,

) are in fp(A, Ab) and in fact in

fp0(A, Ab).

(2) The functors Ext1(A,
(3) For every functor F ∈ fp0(A, Ab), there is a monomorphism

) are injective objectives in fp0(A, Ab).

F → Ext1(A,

)

for some A ∈ A. That is the Serre subcategory fp0(A, Ab) has enough
injectives of the form Ext1(A,
).

(4) A functor F in fp0(A, Ab) is injective if and only if F is half exact.

Moreover, Freyd showed in [11] that if A has countable sums then any
direct summand F of an extension functor Ext1(A,
) is isomorphic to
Ext1(C,
) for some C ∈ A. Combining this with Auslander’s result, if
A is has enough projectives and has countable sums, then any half exact
ﬁnitely presented functor F : A −→ Ab is isomorphic to an extension functor
Ext1(C,
) for some C ∈ A. Thus in the case A = Mod(R), the category
fp0(A, Ab) has enough injectives and they are precisely the extension func-
tors.

2.3. The Tensor Embedding. The Yoneda lemma allows one to study the
functor category fp(A, Ab) for any abelian category A due to the fact that
the natural transformations between any two such functors form an actual
set. For any ring R, the module category Mod(R) can be embedded into the
functor category fp(Mod(R), Ab) using the Yoneda embedding. This allows
one to study the category Mod(R) by looking at the category of ﬁnitely
presented functors. There are other approaches to studying the category
Mod(R) using a suitable functor category.

Denote by (mod(Rop), Ab) the category whose objects are additive func-
tors F : mod(Rop) −→ Ab and whose morphisms are the natural transfor-
mations between. This category is also abelian and again a sequence of
functors F → G → H in (mod(Rop), Ab) is exact if and only if for any
ﬁnitely presented module A ∈ mod(Rop), the sequence of abelian groups
F (A) → G(A) → H(A) is exact.

12

SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

The category (mod(Rop), Ab) is in fact Grothendieck. Hence it has enough
projectives and injectives. The projectives of (mod(Rop), Ab) are the sum-
) such that each Xi ∈ mod(Rop).
mands of functors of the form
i∈I (Xi,
The injectives were classiﬁed by Gruson and Jensen in [13] and we now recall
their classiﬁcation.

L

A pure exact sequence in Mod(R) is a short exact sequence of modules

0 → A → B → C → 0

such that

0 → A ⊗ → B ⊗ → C ⊗ → 0
is exact in (mod(Rop), Ab). A pure injective module M is any module
which is injective with respect to pure exact sequences. That is given any
pure exact sequence

0 → A → B → C → 0

the sequence

is exact.

0 → (C, M ) → (B, M ) → (A, M ) → 0

Theorem 6 (Gruson, Jensen, [13]). The functor t : Mod(R) −→ (mod(Rop), Ab)
given by

satisﬁes the following two properties.

t(M ) = M ⊗

(1) t is a fully faithful covariant functor. Due to this property, we call

the functor t the tensor embedding.

(2) The injectives of (mod(Rop), Ab) are precisely the functors of the
for which M is pure injective. That is, a functor
form M ⊗
F : mod(Rop) → Ab is injective in (mod(Rop), Ab) if and only if it is
isomorphic to t(M ) for some pure injective M ∈ Mod(R).

2.4. The Auslander-Gruson-Jensen Functor. In [8] we study the rela-
tionship between the functor categories fp(Mod(R), Ab) and (mod(Rop), Ab).
The category (mod(Rop), Ab) is abelian and the category fp(Mod(R), Ab) has
enough projectives. Given any contravariant functor

S : fp(Mod(R), Ab) −→ (mod(Rop), Ab)

we can use the projectives to compute the zeroth right derived functor R0S
which will be a contravariant left exact functor. By composing the tensor
embedding t with the defect w we get a functor

t ◦ w : fp(Mod(R), Ab) −→ (mod(Rop), Ab)

which is right exact contravariant and sends any ﬁnitely presented functor
F to the tensor functor w(F ) ⊗ .

DERIVED RECOLLEMENTS AND GENERALISED AR FORMULAS

13

The Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor1 is the zeroth right derived

functor of t ◦ w. That is,

DA = R0(t ◦ w)

As shown in [8], the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor

DA : fp(Mod(R), Ab) → (mod(Rop), Ab)

is completely determined by the following

(1) DA is exact contravariant.
(2) For any (X,
(3) For any (f,

), DA(X,
) : (Y,

) = X ⊗ .

) −→ (X,

), DA(f,

) = f ⊗ .

2.5. Stable Categories. Suppose that A is an additive category with enough
projectives. Given any two objects X, Y ∈ A the set P(X, Y ) is deﬁned to
be the collection of all f ∈ HomA(X, Y ) such that there exists a projective
P and a commutative triangle

X

a

Y

b

f

P

P(X, Y ) is a subgroup of Hom(X, Y ) and hence one can move to the quotient
group

Hom(X, Y ) =

Hom(X, Y )
P(X, Y )

The projectively stable category A is deﬁned as follows. The objects of
A are the same as that of the category A. Given X, Y ∈ A, the morphism
set HomA(X, Y ) is deﬁned as follows

HomA(X, Y ) = Hom(X, Y )

Dually one can create for any additive category with enough injectives,
the injectively stable category A. The category A comes with a functor
Q : A → A sending every object A ∈ A to the object A ∈ A. The functor Q
together with A satisfy the following universal property. If B is any additive
category and E : A → B is any additive functor vanishing on all injectives
in A, then there is a unique Ψ such that the following diagram commutes

Q

A

∃!Ψ

1The functor DA is named as such due to the fact that Auslander in [3] and indepen-
dently Gruson and Jensen in [13] deﬁne for any additive functor F : Mod(R) → Ab, a
corresponding functor DF : mod(Rop) → Ab which agrees with DAF in the case that F is
ﬁnitely presented.

14

SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

The category A also comes with a functor Q : A → A satisfying a similar
universal property.

3. Reflective Adjunctions and the Derived Recollement

Theorem

All categories considered in this section will be abelian. Some of
the statements may hold in generality; however, our focus is on the abelian
setting. The reader is referred to Theorem 1 in Chapter IV, Section 3 from
[17], for a proof of the following lemma, which we will use without comment.

Lemma 7. If (λ, ρ, η, ǫ) is an adjunction

C

λ

ρ

D

with unit η and counit ε, then

(1) ρ is fully faithful if and only if the counit of adjunction ε is an

isomorphism.

(2) λ is fully faithful if and only if the unit of adjunction η is an isomor-

phism.

Deﬁnition 2. A recollement consists of a diagram of functors between
abelian categories A, B, C,

A

iL

i

iR

B

fL

f

fR

C

where

(1) The functor f has left adjoint fL and right adjoint fR.
(2) The unit 1C → f fL and counit f fR → 1C are isomorphisms.
(3) The functor i has left adjoint iL and right adjoint iR.
(4) The unit 1A → iRi and counit iLi → 1A are isomorphisms.
(5) The functor i is an embedding onto the full subcategory of A con-

sisting of all objects A for which f (A) = 0.
Equivalently, a recollement is such a diagram with:

(1) The functor f has left adjoint fL and right adjoint fR.
(2) fL and fR are fully faithful.

Deﬁnition 3. An adjunction λ ⊣ ρ

C

D

is called reﬂective if ρ is fully faithful and coreﬂective if λ is fully faithful.
Equivalently, it is reﬂective iﬀ the counit λρ → 1 is an isomorphism, and it
is coreﬂective iﬀ the unit 1 → ρλ is an isomorphism.

Lemma 8. Given a functor G : C → D with adjoints F ⊣ G ⊣ H, F is
fully faithful if and only if H is fully faithful. In the language above, the
adjunction F ⊣ G is coreﬂective if and only if G ⊣ H is reﬂective.

Proof. Let η and ǫ be the unit and counit of the adjunction F ⊣ G and let
θ and ζ be the unit and counit of the adjunction G ⊣ H.

If F is fully faithful, the unit η : 1D → GF is an isomorphism. Therefore
GF is an equivalence. By composition of adjunctions, it follows that GF ⊣
GH, with unit (GθF )η and counit ζ(HǫG). Since GF is an equivalence,
so is GH, and hence both are fully faithful. Therefore, both (GθF )η and
ζ(HǫG) are isomorphisms. Note that, since (ηG)(ǫG) = 1G, ǫG and hence
HǫG is an isomorphism. It follows that ζ is an isomorphism, and hence H
is fully faithful. The other direction is dual.(cid:4)

The following generalizes Auslander’s approach to constructing the defect

sequence from [1].

Lemma 9. Let (λ, ρ, η, ε) denote an adjunction

there is an adjoint pair

is obtained by taking the kernel and cokernel of ηC . The fact that λ(ηC) is
an isomorphism and that λ is always right exact forces λ(C1) ∼= 0.

If λ is exact, then λ(C0) ∼= 0 again because λ(ηC ) is an isomorphism.
It is also clear that if λ(B) ∼= 0, then B ∼= B0. Therefore, for any object
B ∈ Ker(λ), there is an isomorphism

Hom(i(B), C) ∼= HomKer(λ)(B, C0)

which is easily seen to be natural in B and C. (cid:4)

the following diagram commute. Furthermore, ψ is exact.

now has that Eλρ ∼= E establishing that ψρ ∼= E as required.

We conclude with the uniqueness portion of the argument. If θ : D −→ A

is exact and satisﬁes θρ ∼= E, then since λρ ∼= 1D we have

θ ∼= θ1D ∼= θλρ ∼= Eρ = ψ

which shows that θ ∼= ψ as claimed. This completes the proof that λ is a
Serre localization functor. (cid:4)

The next lemma will be used implicitly in our main theorem.

Lemma 13. Let α : F → G be a natural transformation between right
exact functors F, G : C → D where C and D are abelian categories and C
has enough projectives. If αP : F (P ) → G(P ) is an isomorphism for any
projective P ∈ C then α is an isomorphism.

tion

Assume that

(1) For any projective P ∈ C there is some object D ∈ D such that

In particular, λ is exact.

Proof. By Corollary 11 all that we must do is show that we have an ad-
junction (L0ρ, λ). Let µ = L0ρ. Let ǫ : λρ → 1 be the counit of the
adjunction (λ, ρ), which is an isomorphism. Since ρ preserves projectives,
we may assume µ(P ) = ρ(P ) for any projective P ∈ D,

We ﬁrst construct the counit ζ : 1 → λµ. Let D ∈ D be given, and choose
a projective presentation P → Q → D → 0. We deﬁne ζD : D → λµ(D) to

commutes. Using the comparison theorem of homological algebra, one can
show that ζD is natural in D.

For any D ∈ D and C ∈ C, we have the morphism

Hom(µ(D), C) → Hom(D, λ(C)) : g 7→ (λ(g))ζD.

We need to show that this is bijective. Since µ is right exact and D has
enough projectives, we may assume that D is projective. Therefore, µ(D) =
ρ(D) and we need only show that, when D is projective,

Hom(ρ(D), C) → Hom(D, λ(C)) : g 7→ (λ(g))ζD.

But since, ρ(D) is projective and λ is right exact and C has enough pro-
jectives, we may assume that C is projective, and hence C = ρ(D′) for an
object D′ ∈ D. Since ρ is fully faithful, our morphism becomes

Hom(ρ(D), ρ(D′)) → Hom(D, λ(D′))

ρ(f ) 7→ (λρ(f ))ǫ−1

D = ǫ−1
D′ f

which, since ρ is fully faithful, is clearly a bijection.

We state without proof the dual.

Deﬁnition 4. A recollement (L0ρ, λ, ρ) will be called a left derived recollement
and a recollement (λ, ρ, R0λ) will be called a right derived recollement.
Both will be referred to as derived recollements.

where A is an abelian category with enough projectives.

SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

Also, note that the kernel Ker(w) is equivalent to the category of short
exact sequences in A, where the morphisms are homotopy classes of chain
maps. Therefore, this category is abelian (whereas, by a characterisation of
monomorphisms and epimorphisms, the category of short exact sequences
and chain maps (rather than homotopy classes of chain maps) is not abelian
unless A ≃ 0, because there are morphisms which are monic and epic but
not invertible).

4.2. A recollement for ﬁnitely accessible categories. Let C be a ﬁnitely
accessible category. We have the embedding h : C → ((fpC)op, Ab) : C 7→
(

, C).
Suppose C is cocomplete. Deﬁne v : ((fpC)op, Ab) → C, to be the unique
functor which preserves colimits such that, for any C ∈ C, there is an iso-
, C)) ∼= C which is natural in C. One can show that v is the
morphism v((
left adjoint of h.

Now assume that C is abelian with enough projectives. The projectives
in ((fpC)op, Ab) are those functors of the form (
, P ) where P is a pure
projective. Using this, it is easy to verify the assumptions of the main
theorem, and hence we have the following.

projectives then there is a recollement

Remark. We take this opportunity to point out that our main theorem in
fact holds in greater generality. In the notation of the theorem, D need not
be an abelian category, but it could just be an exact category with enough
projectives, with the 0-th derived functor read as being with respect to those
projectives. (Note that the deﬁnition of recollement still makes sense in this
broader setting.) It follows that, in this example, we needn’t have assumed
that our ﬁnitely accessible category C is abelian with enough projectives:
It is enough that we have the pure exact structure on C, which is always
present and always has enough pure projectives (see [6]).

4.3. A recollement for modules as tensor products. The injectives
in (mod(Rop), Ab) are those functors of the form M ⊗
where M is pure
injective. It follows that, by our main theorem, we have the following.

Corollary 18. There is a recollement

This shows that evR, evaluation at the ring, has a fully faithful right

adjoint, and so by Theorem 12 we have the following.

Corollary 19. For any ring R,

(mod(Rop), Ab)
{F : evR(F ) = 0}

≃ Mod(R).

Since every functor F : mod(Rop) → Ab has an injective copresentation,
and injectives in (mod(Rop), Ab) are of the form M ⊗ for a pure injective
M , the kernel Ker(evR) is equivalent to the category of short exact sequences
of pure injectives, where morphisms are homotopy classes of chain maps.
Therefore, this category is abelian.

4.4. A recollement for modules over coherent rings. Let C be an
additive category with weak kernels (or a coherent ring). The injectives
in fp(mod(Cop), Ab) are those functors of the form M ⊗
for a ﬁnitely
presented module M ∈ mod(C). Applying our main theorem, we have the
following.

for some M ∈ mod(C).

From Proposition 12 we have the equivalence

fp(mod(Cop), Ab)
{F : evC(F ) = 0}

≃ mod(C).

24

SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

We now apply this to ﬁnd a result about dualising k-varieties which gener-
alises [5, Proposition 2.5].

Corollary 21. Let k be a commutative artinian ring.
If C is a ﬁnite k-
variety category with weak kernels and weak cokernels such that mod(Cop)
is a dualising variety then C is also a dualising variety.

Proof. Since C has weak kernels and weak cokernels, both mod(C) and
mod(Cop) are abelian.

Let A = mod(Cop). The defect w : fp(Aop, Ab) → A is given by w(F )(C) =
F (HomC(C, −)) for all F ∈ fp(Aop, Ab) and C ∈ C. By the deﬁnition of evC,
it is clear that, under the standard equivalence fp(A, Ab) ≃ (fp(Aop, Ab))op,
the Serre subcategory {F : evC(F ) = 0} corresponds to {G : w(G) = 0}.

By this and the equivalence fp(Aop, Ab)/{G : w(G) = 0} ≃ A established

in [1, Section 3], we have

mod(C) ≃

fp(A, Ab)
{F : evC(F ) = 0}

≃

(fp(Aop, Ab))op
{G : w(G) = 0}

≃ mod(Cop)op.

One can easily show that this equivalence is isomorphic to the functor M 7→
Homk(M (
), k/J) where J is the Jacobson radical of k. This shows that C
is a dualising variety.

4.5. A non-example. We will show that the tensor embedding t : mod(R) →
fp(Mod(Rop), Ab) : M 7→ M ⊗
does not admit a right adjoint. This
means that the process carried out in previous examples cannot even begin
for this embedding. Assume for contradiction that t has a right adjoint ρ.
Let {Mλ}λ∈Λ be an indexed family of ﬁnitely presented right R-modules.
Then, since fp(Mod(Rop), Ab) has products, and ρ must preserve products,
λ t(Mλ)) is the product of the Mλ in mod(R). Therefore mod(R) has
ρ(
arbitrary products. In particular, mod(R) has arbitrary powers. We will
now explain why this is a contradiction.

Q

We recall an argument due to Freyd which shows that a small category
C with arbitrary powers must have |C(A, B)| 6 1 for any A, B ∈ C. Since
C is small, each hom-set in C must have cardinality at most |X|, where
X is the set of all morphisms in C. Suppose C has arbitrary powers and
assume for contradiction that |C(A, B)| > 2 for some A, B ∈ C. Then
|C(A, BX )| = |C(A, B)X | = |C(A, B)||X| > 2|X| > |X|, a contradiction. In
particular, if C is a small pre-additive category with arbitrary powers then
C ≃ 0.

4.6. The Auslander-Gruson-Jenson Recollement. In [8] the follow-
ing result was established. We can now view this as a corollary of our
main theorem. The functor DA can be described by the explicit formula
DA(F )(M ) = Nat(F, ⊗ M ) (one can verify this by using the fact that

DERIVED RECOLLEMENTS AND GENERALISED AR FORMULAS

25

⊗ M is injective in fp(Mod(R), Ab)).

Its right adjoint, DR, can be de-

scribed by the similar formula DR(G)(N ) = Nat(G, N ⊗ −).

The projectives in fp(Mod(R), Ab) are precisely the representable func-
tors, and the projectives in (mod(Rop), Ab)op are the functors of the form
for a pure injective N ∈ Mod(R). One can use this information to
N ⊗
verify the assumptions in our main theorem and establish the following.

The kernel, Ker(DA), is dual to the category of pure exact sequences in

this category is abelian.

4.7. The Restriction Recollement. In [15], Krause shows that any ﬁnitely
accessible additive category has weak kernels. Let C be a ﬁnitely accessible
additive category. Then fp(Cop, Ab) is abelian by Krause’s result.

Any functor G ∈ ((fpC)op, Ab) has can be extended to a unique functor

Krause observed the existence of the left adjoint to R in [15], describing it
as the unique functor ((fpC)op, Ab) → fp(Cop, Ab) which preserves colimits
and sends a representable HomfpC(−, X) to HomC(−, X). However, for this
argument, one must take note that fp(Cop, Ab) actually has all colimits.
Indeed it has cokernels, but the coproducts are unexpected, as the Yoneda
embedding C → fp(Cop, Ab) preserves them. As an example of our main
theorem, we give an alternative method for constructing a left adjoint.

Any projective in fp(Cop, Ab) is of the form HomC(

If C also has kernels (see [6] for necessary and suﬃcient conditions for this),
then Ker(R) is equivalent to the category of pure exact sequences, where
morphisms are homotopy classes of chain maps. Therefore, this category is
abelian.

5. Defect Zero Functors and Duality

Around the same time that Auslander published his landmark paper on
coherent functors, which many now call ﬁnitely presented functors, his stu-
dents Janet Fisher-Palmquist and David Newell were researching how to
extend many of the familiar module theoretic concepts to appropriate func-
tor theoretic concepts. The idea was that if one can view a functor as a
generalization of a module, then any property that the module category
Mod(R) exhibits may have a functor analog.

In particular Fisher-Palmquist and Newell, like Auslander, were very in-
terested in bringing methods from homological algebra to functor categories.
This is evident in the following series of papers.

(1) In [9] Fisher discusses properties of a tensor product of functors

F ⊗ G which is a generalization of the tensor product of modules.

(2) In [10] Fisher-Palmquist and Newell establish that the analog of a
bi-module at the level of functors is the notion of a bifunctor. The
analog of the bi-module R is the bifunctor Hom. As such the dual
)∗
Hom(
described below. One of the main results from [10] is that adjoints
between functor categories arise as the analog of the hom-tensor
adjunction.

, R) has an analog for functors which is the functor (

(3) In [18], Newell extends the well known Morita Theorems for module

categories to functor categories.

The following is the construction of Fisher-Palmquist and Newell appear-
ing in [10]. Given a covariant functor F : A → Ab, there is a contravariant
functor F ∗ : A −→ Ab deﬁned by

F ∗(X) = Nat

F, (X,

)
(cid:1)

Similarly given a contravariant functor G : A −→ Ab there is a covariant
functor G∗ : A −→ Ab deﬁned by

fp(A, Ab) and fp(Aop, Ab). The following fp-dual formula is established

injectives. In this case, one can compute the left derived functors Lk(

generality for any abelian category A which has both enough projectives and injectives.

(1) If F has defect zero, then W2(F ) has defect zero.

same short exact sequence.
(3) W2 restricts to a duality W

fp0(Aop, Ab)

The duality W on these Serre subcategories fp0(A, Ab) and fp0(Aop, Ab)
implies that every short exact sequence induces two ﬁnitely presented func-
tors which can be identiﬁed via W. Both F and W2(F ) arise from the same
short exact sequence. This in some way explains why certain notions in rep-
resentation theory concerning short exact sequences are symmetrical. For
example, if Λ is an artin algebra, then the simple functors S : mod(Λ) → Ab
are ﬁnitely presented as shown by Auslander in [2]. Moreover, w(S) = 0 and
it can be shown that S arises from an almost split sequence. The functor
W(S) will be co-simple which turns out to be equivalent to being simple.
The functor W(S) arises from the same almost split sequence. Similarly, if a
ﬁnitely presented functor F arises from a pure exact sequence, then its dual
W(F ) arises from the same pure exact sequence. We now state the promised
formulas.

Theorem 26. [The Generalised Auslander-Reiten Formulas] Assume that
A is abelian.

(1) If A has enough projectives then

(a) fp0(A, Ab) has enough injectives of the form Ext1(A,

).

Hom(C,

Proof. Since (1) and (2) are completely dual statements we need only show
(1). Auslander shows in [1] that fp0(A, Ab) has enough injectives of the form
Ext1(C,
) under the assumptions of (1). The functor W is a duality and
hence sends injectives to projectives. All that remains is to show that the
duality W sends the functor Ext1(C,
, C). From

Since g is an epimorphism from the projective P to C one can easily show
that a morphism h : X −→ C is in the subgroup P(C, X) of morphisms
factoring through some projective if and only if it is in the image of (X, f ).
Since WExt1(C,

)(X) ∼= Coker((X, f )),

WExt1(C,

)(X) ∼= Hom(X, C)/P(X, C) = Hom(

This isomorphism is also easily seen to be natural so in fact we have

Hom(

Remark. Auslander-Reiten formulas have been studied not only for mod-
ules, but objects in any Grothendieck abelian category, by Krause. See [16]
for this. Here our focus is on the duality W which is obtained by comput-
)∗. This functor will be used to relate
ing derived functors of the dual (
the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen Recollement and the Restriction Recollement.
We leave it to the interested reader to investigate what the Generalised
Auslander-Reiten formulas say for a particular choice of the abelian cate-
gory A. At the end of the paper, we show that these formulas reduce to the
original Auslander-Reiten formulas. The fact that we are able to recover
these formulas by looking at derived functors of (

)∗ is quite surprising.

Corollary 27. Suppose that A is an abelian category.

(1) If A has enough injectives, then fp0(A, Ab) ∼= fp(A, Ab).
(2) It A has enough projectives, then fp0(Aop, Ab) ∼= fp(Aop, Ab).
(3) If A has enough injectives and projectives, then fp(Aop, Ab) ∼= fp(A, Ab).

Proof. In this case by Theorem 26, every functor F ∈ fp0(A, Ab) has a
projective presentation

The equivalence is given by F 7→ F ◦ Q where Q is the quotient functor
Q : A → A. (2) is dual to (1). (3) follows by composition of the equivalences
in (1) and (2). The details are left to the reader. (cid:4)

We now state the Serre Localization properties of the restrictions of R
and DA. The reason these restrict to localizations in the following settings
comes from the fact that w ∼= evRDA, wDL ∼= evR, and v ∼= evRR. The
details are left to the reader.

Proposition 28 (Serre Localization Property of R). The restriction of the
functor R to

R : fp0(Mod(R)op, Ab) → (mod(R)op, Ab)

is a Serre localization. That is given any exact functor

E : fp0(Mod(R), Ab) → B
with B abelian such that Ker(E) ⊆ Ker(R), then there is a unique exact
functor Ψ making the following diagram commute.

Proposition 29 (Serre Localization Property of DA). The restriction of the
Auslander-Gruson-Jensen functor DA to

DA : fp0(Mod(R), Ab) → (mod(Rop), Ab)

is a Serre localization. That is for any exact functor

E : fp0(Mod(R), Ab) → B
with B abelian and Ker(E) ⊆ Ker(DA), there is a unique exact functor Ψ
making the following diagram commute.

To state the next result, we need to review the concept of the transpose of
a ﬁnitely presented module M originally introduced by Auslander in [1] and
later studied by Auslander and Bridger in [4]. Suppose that M ∈ mod(R).
Then M has presentation

Rm

Rn

M

DERIVED RECOLLEMENTS AND GENERALISED AR FORMULAS

where A is an n by m matrix with entries from the ring R. A transpose
of the module M is any module Tr(M ) obtained by taking the transpose
of the matrix AT and taking its cokernel. This new module Tr(M ) lives in
mod(Rop) and has a projective presentation

AT

Rn

Rm

Tr(M )

0

The process of moving from M to a transpose Tr(M ) is not functorial. It
depends on the choice of matrix presentation; however, as shown in [4],
transposes are uniquely determined up to projective equivalence. That is,
if Tr1(M ) and Tr2(M ) are two transposes of M , then there exists ﬁnitely
projectives P, Q, such that

Tr1(M ) ⊕ P ∼= Tr2(M ) ⊕ Q
For this reason, if M ∈ mod(Rop) and F : mod(R) → Ab vanishes on projec-
tives, then the assignment M 7→ F (Tr(M )) is actually functorial.

Recall that a functor F : mod(R) → Ab vanishes on a projective if and
only if it factors uniquely through the projectively stable category mod(R)
whose objects are the objects in mod(R) and whose morphisms are mor-
phisms in mod(R) modulo those factoring through projectives. Hence there
is an equivalence of the functor categories (mod(R), Ab) and the full sub-
category of (mod(R), Ab) consisting of those functors which vanish on pro-
jectives. The functors F ∈ (mod(R), Ab) which vanish on projectives are
precisely those for which F (R) = 0. This means the categories Ker(evR)
and (mod(R), Ab) are equivalent.

In [14], Herzog shows that there is a duality

Tr∗

(mod(Rop), Ab)

(mod(R)op, Ab)

Tr∗

given by Tr∗(F )(M ) := F (Tr(M )). We can recover this same duality using
the functors W, DA, and R and the universal property of Serre localization
as follows.

Theorem 30. The duality W induces a duality T resulting in the following
commutative diagram

SAMUEL DEAN AND JEREMY RUSSELL

The duality T is isomorphic to the generalized Auslander-Bridger transpose
Tr∗ studied by Herzog in [14]. Hence the duality Tr∗ can be recovered via a
universal property.

Proof. We have the following commutative diagram of functors

fp0(Mod(R), Ab)

W

T

where T is induced by the Serre localization property of DA and R respec-
tively because W sends functors arising from pure exact sequences to functors
arising from pure exact sequences. By the uniqueness of T, it follows that
T2 ∼= 1 in both cases. One can easily show that since DA((X,
and DA is exact, we have

)) ∼= X ⊗

DA(Ext1(M,

)) ∼= Tor1(M,

)

Even clearer is that

R(Ext1(

, M )) ∼= Ext1(

, M ).

Any F ∈ (mod(Rop), Ab) has a projective presentation

where A, B are ﬁnitely presented. Both Tr∗ and T are dualities and hence
they are both fully faithful and both send arbitrary sums to products. There-
fore to show that Tr∗ ∼= T we need only show that they agree on functors
of the form Hom(M,
) where M is ﬁnitely presented. Since Tr is itself a
duality on the projectively stable ﬁnitely presented module categories, we
actually have

Tr∗(Hom(M,

)) ∼= Hom(M, Tr(

This shows that T and Tr∗ agree on functors of the form Hom(M,

ﬁll the diagram and hence T ∼= Tr∗ as claimed. (cid:4)

Example (Auslander-Reiten Formulas). As an example of the Generalised
Auslander-Reiten Formulas, we derive the well-known Auslander-Reiten For-
mulas that appear in the representation theory of Artin algebras, as they
are given at [15], from the above theorem.

Suppose R is a k-algebra and let I be an injective cogenerator of Mod(k),

for any commutative ring k.

For a functor F : A → Ab, where A is a k-linear category, we write
Dk(F ) = Nat(F , I). For a left R-module M , we also write Dk(M ) for
the right R-module Homk(M, I). For functors F : A → Ab and G : Aop →
Ab, there is a natural isomorphism Nat(F, Dk(G)) ∼= (G, Dk(F )) (see [7,
Lemma 2.3] for a discussion on this isomorphism for modules, which is easily
generalised).

One can easily show that DkTor1(

). This follows
easily from the hom-tensor duality, and the fact that M 7→ DkM is exact.
In the notation of the above theorem, the Auslander-Reiten formulas be-

DkRHom(

) ∼= DkTRExt1(

Hom(A, Dk

We now prove these formulas by using The Generalised Auslander-Reiten
formulas and the previous result.

For the ﬁrst formula,

DkRHom(

∼= DkTDAExt1(
∼= DkTTor1(
∼= DkTor1(Tr
∼= Ext1(C, DkTr

, C)

, C)

)

For the second formula, we need to recall some facts.

For any left R-module M , DkM is pure injective. This is a well-known
[19, 4.3.29]). However, it can be seen due to the fact that,
fact (see, e.g.
in (mod(R), Ab), Dk(
, M ) is ﬂat
in this functor category, its dual is injective. Since DL agrees with DR on
injectives, it follows that, for any left R-module M ,

, M ) ∼= (DkM ) ⊗R

, and so, since (

DL((DkM ) ⊗ ) ∼= (DkM,

).

From this, we obtain the isomorphisms

∼= Nat(DAHom(A,

), Hom(A,

))

))

That is,

DkDAHom(A, −) ∼= Hom(A, Dk

).

We can now derive the second Auslander-Reiten formula.

Hom(A, Dk

) ∼= DkDAHom(A, −)
∼= DkDAWExt1(−, C)
∼= DkTRExt1(
, C)

Remark. It should be pointed out that the isomorphism

Nat(DAHom(A,

), (DkB) ⊗ ) ∼= Nat(DL((DkB) ⊗ ), Hom(A,

))

used in the example above follows from the adjunction formula of DL and
DA appearing in [8].
