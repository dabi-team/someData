(Received 19 July 2019)

We carry out Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of ﬂows in closed rectangular ducts with several
aspect ratios. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized through a second-order ﬁnite diﬀerence
scheme, with non-uniform grids in two directions. The duct cross-sectional area is maintained constant
as well as the ﬂow rate, which allows to investigate which is the appropriate length scale in the
Reynolds number for a good scaling in the laminar and in the fully turbulent regimes. We ﬁnd that
the Reynolds number based on the half length of the short side leads to a critical Reynolds number
which is independent on the aspect ratio (AR), for ducts with AR > 1. The mean and rms wall-normal
velocity proﬁles are found to scale with the local value of the friction velocity. At high friction Reynolds
numbers, the Reynolds number dependence is similar to that in turbulent plane channels, hence ﬂows
in rectangular ducts allow to investigate the Reynolds number dependency through a reduced number
of simulations. At low Re the proﬁles of the statistics diﬀer from those in the two-dimensional channel
due to the interaction of ﬂow structures of diﬀerent size. The projection of the velocity vector and
of the Reynolds stress tensor along the eigenvectors of the strain-rate tensor yields reduced Reynolds
stress anisotropy, and simple turbulent kinetic energy budgets.

1. Introduction

Many eﬀorts have been directed to understanding laminar, transitional and turbulent ﬂows near
walls. The turbulent channel has been largely considered in Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS),
where two homogeneous directions allow to get satisfactory statistics proﬁles with a limited number
of ﬁelds. This ﬂow can not be exactly reproduced in laboratory experiments where the eﬀects of the
lateral walls can not be eliminated. Several studies, for instance the most recent by Vinuesa et al.
(2014), and by Vinuesa et al. (2016)) were devoted to investigate the diﬀerences between ideal two-
dimensional turbulent channels and rectangular ducts with high and low aspect ratio. The simulations
500). The transitional
and the experiments were performed at intermediate Reynolds number (Reτ ≈
regime for the square duct was considered numerically by Uhlmann et al. (2007) and experimentally
by Owolabi et al. (2016). Numerically it is easy to relate the friction Reτ = uτ L/ν, with L the length
of the side of the square duct and uτ the mean friction velocity, to the bulk Reynolds number ReL =
UbL/ν. They found that the turbulent regime is observed above ReL = 1077, and up to ReL = 2000
there is a linear relationship between the two Reynolds numbers. In the laminar regime the relationship
was given by Tatsumi & Yoshimura (1990) Reτ = √aReL with a = 3.3935. Experimentally it is rather
diﬃcult to have an exact value of the global friction velocity since the wall shear stress varies along the
walls. Therefore Owolabi et al. (2016) deﬁned the critical Reynolds number as that, at which, a sharp
decrease of the mean streamwise velocity U1 at the center of the duct is measured. They obtained
values in good agreement with those in the DNS of Uhlmann et al. (2007). The value ReL = 1077
does not diﬀer too much from that in circular pipes (ReC = 1125 by Faisst & Eckhardt (2004)) and
in a plane channel (ReC = 1000 by Carlson et al. (1982)). Orlandi et al. (2015) through DNS of
Poiseuille and Couette ﬂows observed a jump on the total turbulent kinetic energy respectively at
Re
1800 for Poiseuille and Re = 1000 for the Couette ﬂows. These Reynolds numbers are deﬁned
as Re = UM H/ν with H half channel width and UM the maximum of the laminar parabolic Poiseille

proﬁle and the wall velocity for Couette. It is important to recall that the initial amplitude disturbances
in the numerical or the inlet conditions in the laboratory experiments can aﬀect the value of the critical
Reynolds. The sensitivity to the disturbances was carefully investigated by Fitzgerald (2004) reporting
the results of sophisticated experiments in circular pipes (Hof et al. 2003), showing that reduction of
the amplitude of the disturbance may lead to an increase of the transition Reynolds number up to
Re = 18000, much greater than the value obtained by Reynolds (1895). Orlandi (2008) performed
numerical experiments to further analyse the inﬂuence of the initial disturbances in circular pipes.
From the observation that there are not large diﬀerences in the critical Reynolds number between
ﬂows with well localised secondary ﬂows and ﬂows without it (circular pipe and plane channel) it
is worth analysing in rectangular ducts which is the appropriate length scale giving a ﬁxed critical
Reynolds number.

In non circular ducts several length scales can be deﬁned. One largely used is the hydraulic diameter
Dh = 4P/A, with P the perimeter and A the cross-section area of the duct (ReD = UbDh/ν). In the
present simulations the reference length is assumed to be the radius of an equivalent pipe, rp (A = πr2
p),
hence the relevant computational Reynolds number is Re = Ubrp/ν. A further length scale appropriate
for rectangular ducts may be half the length of the short side, L3. Let L2 is the length of the long
side, then L2 = L3AR, with AR the aspect ratio. As a ﬁrst check of the diﬀerences in the proﬁles of
the friction factor Cf = 2u2
b versus the three Reynolds numbers above reported can be obtained
by using equation (3-48) at Pg.113 of White (1974). The analytical linear proﬁles together with the
present simulations allow to see the diﬀerent trends of Cf versus the Reynolds numbers.

τ /U 2

The secondary motions, widely analysed in several DNS papers, starting from Gavrilakis (1992)
at low Re, and ending with Pirozzoli et al. (2018) at much higher Re, is rather weak with respect
to the main motion, hence it is likely that they do not alter substantially the statistical proﬁles
with respect to canonical wall-bounded ﬂows. In particular, this should be the case at high values of
the Reynolds numbers, at which the strongest vorticity becomes localised in a smaller and smaller
region (Pirozzoli et al. 2018). Secondary motions have been deeply investigated by Joung et al. (2007),
and a clear picture of its eﬀect can be observed in their ﬁgure 6 reporting undulations of τw/τw near
the corner, with diﬀerences among the proﬁles at diﬀerent Reynolds numbers. The reduction of friction
approaching the corner should also appear on the shape and size of the streamwise vortical structures,
and therefore on the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy. The decrease of the wall shear stress
should be diﬀerent along the short and the long side of the rectangular duct. The present simulations
are focused to investigate the variations with the Reynolds number and with the aspect ratio of
several statistics in particular to demonstrate whether the wall scaling with the averaged or the local
friction velocity hold. In the corners the local Reτ decreases, and therefore, in the same ﬂow it is
possible to investigate whether the Reynolds number dependence of the statistics in wall units shown
by Orlandi et al. (2015) for the plane channel are also recovered.

In plane channel, DNS are often performed by pseudospectral methods, similar or equal to that
described in Kim et al. (1987). These results can be considered as reference solutions to validate
those obtained by other numerical methods. However, Bernardini et al. (2013) demonstrated that by
using the same resolution the streamwise spectra by second order schemes were as good as those
by pseudospectral methods in a convecting reference frame. However, in the steady reference frame
the proﬁles of the statistics did not show any appreciable diﬀerence with those by pseudospectral
methods. The improvement achieved in the convective reference frame was detected in the stream-
wise velocity spectra, at high wavenumbers with low energy content. Based on these observations, in
the present study a second-order staggered ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme is used, with the further advan-
tage of using non-uniform grids in two space directions, adapted from a code previously developed
for the simulations of Poiseuille and Couette ﬂows. The same procedure of low-storage Runge-Kutta
time integration of the nonlinear terms, and implicit treatment of the viscous terms was also used.
The fundamental diﬀerence from the method developed for ﬂows with two homogeneous directions
(spanwise and streamwise) resides in the solution of the elliptical equation. In the case of two homo-
geneous direction, the use of two Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) and a tridiagonal solver (see
Orlandi 2012, Chapter 9), allows to solve Poisson equation within round-oﬀ errors. In order to get a
fast solution at high Reynolds numbers a large number of processors can be used through the MPI

(Message Parallel Interface) directives, by subdividing the computational domain into pencil-shaped
sub-domains. In presence of two direction of grid non-uniformity, the Poisson equation can be solved
either through a multigrid method (Joung et al. 2007), or direct solvers based on the cyclic reduction
algorithm as FISHPACK, developed at NCAR by Adams et al. (1975). The convergence of the multi-
grid is linked to the coordinate stretching, that set the eigenvalues of the associated matrices, hence
to avoid possible slow convergence, the FISHPACK subroutine is a good choice, clearly less eﬃcient
than FFT-based direct solvers. The main disadvantage of the FISHPACK consists in a limitation of
the number of processors, since the computational domain can only be divided into slabs along the
streamwise direction. Another possible alternative is the use of compressible ﬂow solvers adapted for
low-Mach-number ﬂows (Pirozzoli et al. 2018), which were shown to yield nearly identical solutions
as incompressible solvers.

2. Flows set-up

A large number of ﬂow cases have been simulated, with resolution depending on the Reynolds

×
257, respectively in the streamwise x1, lateral x2 and vertical x3 directions. The smaller number
385
of points in x3 than those in x2 is due to the reduction of L3 with the increase of the aspect ratio AR.
In the present simulations the ﬂow rate is maintained constant by adding at each time step a mean
pressure gradient Π balancing the friction losses due to the walls. In the evaluation of the ﬂow rate
the cross-sectional area appears which has been maintained constant. At each Re, several AR were
considered, namely 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. Simulations with AR = 1.5 were also performed in a range of Re close
to the critical one. For the governing equations the reader may refer to Orlandi (2012, Chapter 9),
with no-slip boundary conditions imposed at the duct walls. The distribution of the initial streamwise
velocity is irrelevant, in fact it has been observed that in few time units the distribution adjusts to
the shape of the duct. However it is mandatory that Ub = R R R u1dx1dx2dx3/(L1L2L3) = 1. Previous
DNS (Uhlmann et al. 2007) showed that for square ducts and for L1/(0.5L3) > 10, the wall shear
stress does not change. In the present simulations for all AR, we use L1/rp = 16, hence at AR = 1 we
have L1/(0.5L3) = 18.05. For high AR, L3 decreases and since, as later on shown, L3 is the relevant
length scale, the duct is long enough to resolve the energy-containing longitudinal structures.

Depending on AR and on the value of Re the simulations evolve for a diﬀerent time. At high
Reynolds number the transient time to reach the instant at which Π oscillates around the averaged
Π is short. However, the simulations must evolve for a suﬃcient time in order to have distributions
x3 planes respecting as much as possible the geometrical symmetries. At
of the statistics in the x2
low Re, and, in particular, under laminar conditions a long initial transient is necessary to damp the
initial disturbances through viscous diﬀusion. The averaged wall shear stress τw, calculated through
τw = ΠL2L3/(L2 + L3), allows to deﬁne the averaged friction velocity uτ = √τw, and the friction
coeﬃcient, Cf = 2τw/U 2

averaging in the streamwise direction x1 of the duct, and in time. The averages in time were estimated
by storing a suﬃcient number of ﬁelds saved every 1.0 time units. It may be observed that this is
in general insuﬃcient to reproduce the expected geometrical symmetries. Hence, further averaging is
carried out by quarters of the cross section. It is important to recall that in turbulent plane channels

3. Results

3.1.1. Friction factor

3.1. Square ducts

Wall-bounded ﬂows are characterised by variation of the friction coeﬃcient with the bulk Reynolds
number. In canonical ﬂows as circular pipes and two-dimensional plane channels, the relevant length
scale is well deﬁned, the pipe diameter in the ﬁrst case, and the half channel height in the latter. For
ducts with complex shape the hydraulic radius Dh is frequently used. The validation of the present
results is ﬁrst carried out for square ducts, widely investigated under laminar, transitional and fully
turbulent conditions at high Reynolds numbers. Several laboratory data were reported by Jones (1976),
among which we extract the values by Schiller (1923) and Hartnett et al. (1962) of the friction factor,
f = 4Cf . More recently, Owolabi et al. (2016) investigated in greater detail the transitional regime in
square-duct ﬂow through laboratory experiments, with and without inlet tripping. They measured the
mean and the rms streamwise velocity at the duct center and at a distance 0.3h (with h the side of the
duct) from the wall. We consider here only the data at the duct center, where the mean velocity U1
is high in laminar ﬂows, and sharply decreases past transition. Correspondingly, its variance abruptly
increases starting from zero. Figure 2c shows that the present data reproduce well the reduction of U1,
and in ﬁgure 2d the increase of urms. Figure 2b shows the diﬀerent relationships between Reτ and Reb
in the laminar and the turbulent regimes. The laminar results agree well with the theoretical relation
Reτ = √3.3935Re (Tatsumi & Yoshimura 1990), and fully turbulent DNS data (Uhlmann et al. 2007).
This ﬁgure further shows that DNS reproduces the laboratory data. Data scatter is observed around
the critical Reynolds number, which may be due to the diﬀerent initial conditions in DNS, or to inlet

disturbances in the laboratory. To better investigate this inﬂuence, our data have been compared with
the mean velocity (ﬁgure 2c) and rms velocity (ﬁgure 2d), measurements by Owolabi et al. (2016).
Those authors inserted a trip at the inlet of the square duct observing that in these circumstances
transition occurs at Re
940 (ﬁgure 2c). Without the tripping device, transition occurs at Re = 1350
(ﬁgure 2c). The present results agree with the data obtained without trip. The DNS data show
constant velocity in the laminar conditions, and sharp transition to a value that decreases slowly in
the turbulent regime. The value reached at the highest Re considered (Reb = 2670) is U1/Ub = 1.281.
The same trend for the laboratory and numerical experiments is shown for urms/Ub in ﬁgure 2d.
In this case the values of the maxima in the DNS are smaller than those in the experiments. This
quantity should be zero in the laminar regime, hence it is not clear why Owolabi et al. (2016) report
a non-zero value both with and without the tripping device.

and in each quadrant.

3.1.2. Wall friction proﬁles

To understand the discussed behavior of Cf = R τwdr, it is worth analysing the drastic changes
of the proﬁles of τw going from the laminar through the transitional to the fully turbulent regimes.
In ﬁgure 3a τw is zero at r = 0 (the corner) and the strength of the secondary motion dictates the
diﬀerent trends near the corners. As expected, the velocity gradients in the laminar regime do not
depend on the Reynolds numbers. In particular, in ﬁgure 3b, at Re = 1300, Sn is in perfect agreement
with the expression given at page 113 of White (1974). On the other hand, in the transitional and
turbulent regime, Sn grows with diﬀerent trends depending on the Reynolds number. The slope near
the corner is plotted in the inset of ﬁgure 3b showing a growth proportional to Re4/3. Accordingly, the
gradient of τw grows as Re1/3 in the fully turbulent regime, as shown in the inset of ﬁgure 3a. In the
|r=0 with Re equals that in the laminar regime, as given by
transitional regime the variation of dτw/dr
the red line in the inset of ﬁgure 3a. The transitional regime ends at Re = 1600, and from Re = 1750
the values of dτw/dr
|r=0 are aligned with those at high Re numbers. Strong shape variation in the
various ﬂow regimes are apparent. In the laminar regime, τw decreases linearly following as predicted
by equation (3-47) of White (1974, p. 113). In the transitional regime, and in particular in the range of
Re with Cf decreasing as in the laminar regime (see the insert of ﬁgure 2a), a maximum of τw occurs
at distance r = 0.5 from the corner (red dots in in ﬁgure 3a). As discussed later on, this behaviour
does not occur at both the x3 and x2 walls, but rather on either one, depending on the Reynolds
number. Increasing Re, two peaks appear well depicted by the blue and black dots in ﬁgure 3a. One of
the peaks moves closer to the corner at higher Re, whereas the other nearly remains at the center of
the side, with small oscillations in a region which becomes wider at higher Re. (Pirozzoli et al. 2018,
ﬁgure 10) presented distributions of τw in DNS evolving for times much longer than the present ones.
At suﬃciently high Re the shape of the proﬁles is however equivalent to that shown in ﬁgure 3a.

3.1.3. Secondary motions

−

To better understand the diﬀerences noted above, and see whether the statistical quantities re-
produce the expected symmetries it is worth looking at the contours of the stream-function of
the mean secondary motion superimposed to the mean vorticity components (< ω2 >= ∂U1/∂x3,
<
ω3 >= ∂U1/∂x2), divided by the Reynolds number, over the entire duct cross-section. It is im-
portant to keep in mind that the < ωi > contribute to turbulent kinetic energy production, to be
discussed later on. When averaged on all the duct walls, viscous strains return the wall shear stress
distributions shown in ﬁgure 3a. The proﬁles of τw along the whole duct perimeter are shown in
ﬁgure 4, under the corresponding streamfunction and vorticity contours. In the laminar regime (ﬁg-
ure 4a), characterised by the absence of secondary motions, the U1 contours do not change with Re.

The mean strain decreases moving from the walls towards the central region. Immediately after the
1350, the secondary motion consists on four recirculating regions,
critical Reynolds number, ReC ≈
that, at high Re, leads to the well documented eight symmetric regions. In ﬁgure 4 the increments of
the stream-function contours have been maintained ﬁx for all the Reynolds numbers, hence the com-
parison among the diﬀerent regimes leads to the conclusion that the strength of the secondary motion
decreases in the transitional and in the fully turbulent regimes by increasing Re, up to Re = 5000.
At higher Re the strength does not change very much. To emphasise that the ﬂow structures change
in a sharp range of Reynolds number near ReC, visualizations are shown at Re = 1370 in ﬁgure 4b,
and at Re = 1430 in ﬁgure 4c. The corresponding values of Cf in the inset of ﬁgure 2a are given by
the open circles, corroborating the value of ReC and that at Re = 1370 the value of Cf is close to the
green line, corresponding to the presence of four recirculating regions. These ﬁgures demonstrate that
there is an equal probability to have secondary structures in one or in the other side, depending on
the growth of disturbances either near one or the other side, during the initial transient. Animations
allow to see the diﬀerent time history, and see where disturbances form and grow. A slight increase of
Reynolds number (Re = 1430) leads to a secondary motion with four pairs of large-scale structures,
two strong and two weak (ﬁgure 4c). It has been observed by the time history of the mean pressure
gradient Π and of the total turbulent kinetic energy K =< u′2
i > /2, that the convergence to a steady
state requires simulations lasting for very long time. At Re = 1750 ﬁgure 4d shows that the intensity
of the four couples tends to be the same, and that the magnitude of τw along the perimeter is slightly

reduced with respect to that at Re = 1430. At this Re, the inset of ﬁgure 2a shows the start of
tendency towards the Blasius law corresponding to a fully turbulent regime, which is characterised
by a secondary motion with four pairs of recirculating regions. The size of the secondary structures is
comparable to half of the wall length, hence they can transport U1 towards the wall at r = L2/4 and
far from the wall at r = L2/2. Further increase of the Reynolds number (Re = 2500) yields (ﬁgure 4e)
reduction of the strength of the secondary structures, which in addition become conﬁned to the duct
corners. Two maxima appear in the proﬁles of τw, and their amplitude decreases as was observed in
ﬁgure 3a. The thickness of the vorticity layers in ﬁgure 4f, at Re = 5000, reduces, implying that the
near-wall turbulence is not largely aﬀected by secondary motion. This behavior continues by increas-
ing the Reynolds number, as shown in ﬁgure 4g and ﬁgure 4h. From the last two ﬁgures it emerges
that it is quite diﬃcult to have perfect statistical convergence with four secondary ﬂow structures of
equal strength. Even without this accomplishment the ﬁgures with the distribution of the τw along
the perimeter show the changes with the Reynolds number.

3.1.4. Mean pressure gradient

The most complex ﬂows physics in square ducts occurs in our opinion in the transitional regime, in
which secondary motions help promoting mixing and heat transfer. In the DNS the ﬂow dynamics can
be studied by animations of several quantities of interest. However a ﬁrst impression of the complexity
for the cases depicted in ﬁgure 4 may be drawn from the time evolution of Π in the early stages
(ﬁgure 5a), and in the last 400 time units (ﬁgure 5b). As previously mentioned, the initial conditions are
diﬀerent from the laminar distribution, and random disturbances are added, hence high friction occurs
at the walls. The sharp streamwise velocity gradients gradients decrease in a short time due to viscous
eﬀects, and organized ﬂow structures form earlier at higher Re. Transition is frequently characterised
by exponential growth, which is also the case of square ducts, as can be appreciated in ﬁgure 5a. In
this ﬁgure Π is multiplied by the Reynolds number, hence it is a measure of the averaged wall-normal
streamwise velocity gradient. Despite the mentioned diﬀerences, during this transient transitional and
turbulent ﬂows are characterised by an initial decrease followed by exponential growth, terminated by
an absolute maximum. A brief decay then leads to the instant when the pressure gradient begins to
oscillate, at which we start the evaluation of averaged properties. The time evolution in ﬁgure 5b shows
that for Re
2500 small-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations occur, typical of fully turbulent ﬂows,
and steady state is reached in short time. On the other hand, large-scale, low-frequency oscillations
occur at Reynolds numbers close to the critical one, implying that a long time evolution is necessary
to achieve statistical convergence.

time units is shown, for four values of Re. At Re = 1370 the scaled oscillations are very large, and
the reasons is understood by looking at the instantaneous ﬂow visualizations, similar to those in
ﬁgure 4, corresponding to two time instants at which Π is maximum, minimum, and average (marked
with green solid points in the top panel). The ﬁrst impression is that the formation of large-scale
τw,
secondary motions is the cause for the large amplitude oscillations of Π. The proﬁles of τ = τw −
along the perimeter shows that the peaks are located near the center of the four large eddies. A
Re = 2500 the secondary eddies are quite large and cannot move inside the duct, hence the variation
in strength produce oscillations of τ in ﬁgure 6 at the same spatial position. On the other hand, at
Re = 5000 the size of the secondary eddies reduce, hence they can move in the duct, as may be
deduced by comparing the streamfunction contours at diﬀerent instants. This unsteadiness leads to
small-amplitude oscillations of τ , which are quantiﬁed by the location and magnitude of the peaks
of the green and black lines at Re = 5000, which are not ﬁxed as at Re = 2500. At Re = 7750 the

unsteadiness of the eddies increases, as clearly shown by the ψ contours and by the τ proﬁles in ﬁgure
6.

3.1.5. Mean and rms velocity proﬁles

At statistically steady state it is interesting to analyse the proﬁles of the mean streamwise velocity
U1 and of the second-order velocity statistics and to investigate diﬀerences with respect to a two-
dimensional turbulent channel. This comparison allows to get a general view of the complexity of
wall-bounded ﬂows. Square and rectangular ducts are characterised by proﬁles of the mean wall shear
stress τw which decrease in magnitude moving from the center of the walls towards the corners (see
ﬁgure 3a), hence the wall-normal proﬁles should scale with the local friction velocity, uτ . The Reynolds
number dependence in the canonical channel has been studied in several papers (e.g. Bernardini et al.
2014; Lee & Moser 2015) through statistics derived from DNS. The data utilised by Orlandi et al.
(2015) are used for the proﬁles shown in ﬁgure 7a-d. It may be observed that for all the components
of the Reynolds stresses there is a strong Reynolds number dependence at low Reτ . A large jump
of the peak value of u′+
1 occurs between Reτ = 78 and Reτ = 180. Considering the wall region, the
inner-scaled proﬁles do not show large Re dependence at high Reynolds number. In the outer region
the statistics do not scale well in wall units, leading to large diﬀerences in the proﬁles of ﬁgure 7.
The data reported are plotted up to y+ = 1000, being the highest value reached in simulations of
ducts (Pirozzoli et al. 2018). The results at Re = 2500 and Re = 15000 are considered to evaluate
the statistical proﬁles at several distances from the corner. Figure 3a shows that at Re = 2500 the τw
proﬁle has a short ﬂat region, which becomes more elongated at Re = 15000. The comparison between
the statistics for the channel and those for the square duct highlight diﬀerences and similarities.
The proﬁles of U +
77, and at slightly greater
Reτ attains larger than higher Reτ , for the same value of y+. At this Reynolds number there is no
separation between outer and near-wall structures, and a single very large unsteady eddy is present,
causing the overshoot with respect the canonical logarithmic velocity proﬁle. The same also overshoot
occurs in ducts (ﬁgure 7e) at all locations, hence also at a position corresponding to Reτ = 25,
which would be too low to have fully turbulent ﬂow in a two-dimensional channel. The formation of
a mean velocity proﬁle similar to that of fully turbulent ﬂows is therefore due to the dynamics of
the near-wall structures produced in the neighbouring regions. This explains why the U +
1 proﬁle at
Reτ = 25 obtained from the simulation at Re = 15000 does not show the overshoot, which instead
occurs in the simulation at Re = 2500. Some diﬀerence may be observed in the wake region, mainly
due to evaluation of the proﬁles up to the diagonal line in the square duct. Strong interactions among

the turbulent structures may be also inferred from the u′
i proﬁles. In two-dimensional channels, their
peak value at Reτ = 57 (ﬁgure 7b) is one order of magnitude smaller than at high Re. On the other
hand, in the square duct (ﬁgure 7f), the peak at Reτ = 25 is of the same order as at higher Re. In
addition, the peak at Reτ = 25 evaluated from DNS at Re = 15000 (red solid symbol) is higher than
at Re = 2500 (open red circle). This diﬀerence is also visible at Reτ = 175 (solid and open green
circles). At higher values of Reτ there is good collapse of the proﬁles, not found for the channel in
ﬁgure 7b, where diﬀerences appear between Reτ = 500 (black line between the green and the blue
solid circles) and Reτ = 1000. To further appreciate Reynolds number dependence of the outer region
in planar channels, proﬁles (the two black solid lines above the blue solid circles) at Reτ = 2000 and
Reτ = 4000 are also shown in ﬁgure 7a-d. The eﬀect of the interaction among turbulent structures of
diﬀerent size in the ducts can be inferred by the proﬁles of u′
3 (ﬁgure 7h). Also
for these normal stresses the red and green proﬁles at the same Reτ obtained from the simulations at
Re = 2500 (open circles) and Re = 15000 (solid circles) diﬀer in magnitude. For the square duct the

turbulence. Orlandi (2018) exploited channel ﬂow DNS at high Reynolds numbers Bernardini et al.
(2014); Lee & Moser (2015); Yamamoto & Tsuji (2018), to evaluate the Reynolds stresses in the strain
eigenvector basis. In channel Sβ = 0, hence one of the Reynolds stresses is unchanged, whereas the
diﬀerence between the other two is reduces. The turbulent kinetic production in the strain eigenvector
(Pα + Pβ + Pγ), with Pα = RααSα > 0, and Pγ = RγγSγ < 0, and larger than
basis is Pk =
Pk in absolute value. In channels it was found that at any Reynolds number the compressive strain
generates more kinetic energy than is destroyed by extensional one. These results may be useful to
construct more reliable turbulence closures. For duct ﬂows it is diﬃcult to get satisfactory results
with models based on the linear eddy viscosity assumption (Speziale 1982). Therefore the evaluation
of the Reynolds stresses in the reference system based on the eigenvalues of Sij may be of interest.
A comparison between the stresses in the Cartesian reference system and those in the new reference
system are shown in ﬁgure 8. In this ﬁgure a logarithmic scale is used for distances from the corner
to emphasize the near-wall behavior. Wall units are based on the mean friction velocity uτ , and also
used to scale the normal stresses. The results at Re = 7750 may be regarded as representative of ﬂows
at high Reynolds number. The red contours are separated by ∆ = 0.1, and to emphasise the tendency
towards an isotropization in the new strain eigenvector basis, blue contours are shown starting from
unit value, and separated by ∆ = 2. The three top ﬁgures show large anisotropy of the normal stresses,
in fact in ﬁgure 8a there are three blue lines, whereas the other two stresses there only have one blue
contour. In addition, the stresses in the wall-normal direction are not symmetric about the corner
bisector. This asymmetry should also be reproduced in RANS models. On the other hand, the three
bottom panels of ﬁgure 8 show that turbulent stresses become symmetric with respect to the bisector
in the strain eigenvector basis. The anisotropy level is also reduced, in fact only the compressive stress
in ﬁgure 8f has two blue contours. As found by Orlandi (2018) in two-dimensional channels, Rγγ is
found to be larger than Rαα, leading to greater turbulent kinetic energy production through Pγ than
the destruction by the extensional strain, Pα.

3.1.7. Turbulent kinetic energy budgets

The contours of the two extensional and compressional contributions to the turbulent kinetic energy
production are shown in a quadrant in ﬁgure 9. The contribution due to the intermediate principal
strain, Pβ = RββSβ is found to be symmetric with respect to the corner bisector, but much smaller
than the other, hence it is not shown. The symmetry of Pα and Pγ with respect to the corner bisector
is quite good up to Re = 7750, whereas slight asymmetry near the two peaks of Pγ and Pα is found

and total dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. Hence, it may be inferred that direct modeling of DK
in RANS turbulence models should be easier than a separated closure for ǫk and Vk. The distributions
of T +
k (ﬁgure 10c,g,k), which accounts for the mean convection (ﬁrst term in equation (3.1)), triple
velocity correlations (second term), and velocity/pressure gradient correlations (third term) show
that the eﬀect of turbulent transfer is mainly localised in two adjacent positive and negative layers.
Satisfactory universality of the quantities shown in ﬁgure 10 in wall units is observed, especially at
high Reynolds number. This is further supported by comparison of the statistics at Re = 7750 in
ﬁgure 10, with those at Re = 1750, not shown in this paper.

To emphasise the Reynolds number dependence of K +, in ﬁgure 11a the we show iso-contours
separated by ∆ = 1 in red, with superposed the K + = 2 contour (green) and K + = 4 contour (black).
Approximate Reynolds number independence is found, both in the peak value and its location. We
point out that in this ﬁgure the black straight lines mark the the ﬁrst grid point oﬀ the walls, at
d+ = 0.15 at Re = 1750, and at d+ = 0.5 at Re = 15000, which conﬁrms that DNS is fully resolved
near the walls. The maximum of K + occurs near the location of maximum turbulent kinetic energy

the Reynolds number.

leading to diﬃculties in modeling turbulent ﬂows in ducts. The previously discussed simpler features
of turbulent stresses in the strain eigenvector basis, and in particular the symmetric distribution of
the stresses around the corner bisector and the increase of isotropy may instead lead to a simpler
dynamics to model. The larger number of contours in ﬁgure 12f than those in ﬁgure 12d is due to the
stronger eﬀects of the compressive than those of the extensional stress. Despite these small diﬀerences
in magnitude, similar ﬂow structures are found, which may lead to the possibility to improve turbulence
closures. The rββ structures, localised in patches of small magnitude are visible in ﬁgure 12e, which
produce smooth and less intense distribution of Rββ in ﬁgure 8f. The contours in the three bottom
ﬁgures of ﬁgure 12 show good coincidence of rαα and rγγ. On the other hand, rββ is mainly localised

ribbon-like with respect to rod-like structures up to a distance d+
2, and which account for the
spatial distribution of the wall shear stress. Hence, in ﬁgure 13 we present visualizations in wall-parallel
planes (at a distance d+
2) of the vorticity components in the Cartesian basis (top panels), and in
the strain eigenvector basis (bottom panels). Wide regions without vorticity appear in visualizations at
Re = 5000 producing a picture with structures more visible than those at higher Reynolds numbers.
The top panels show that the ω2 and ω3 are localised in very long structures, similar to those in
ﬁgure 12a. ω1 is distributed similarly as the other components in ﬁgure 12b and ﬁgure 12c, providing
evidence for the high intermittency of ω1 and u2. Vorticity is nearly aligned with the intermediate Sβ,
as depicted by the ωβ distributions in ﬁgure 13e, with greater amplitude than ωα and ωγ. The entire
wall friction is proportional to ωβ. It has been also veriﬁed that the sum of the negative and positive
patches in ﬁgure 13d and 13f is zero.

3.1.9. Budgets of mean momentum equations

where Ci denotes the contribution from mean cross-stream ﬂow, Ti the turbulent stresses, Pi the mean

and stands for the external force necessary to balance the frictional resistance. Contours of the velocity
components U +
3 , and the contribution of each term in their transport equations are shown in
ﬁgure 14. Figures 14b and 14c conﬁrm that the distributions of U2 and the U3 are similar by changing
the coordinate x3 with x2. The contributions of each term in the respective balance equations are
plotted in one duct quadrant in inner-scaled logarithmic coordinates, hence they look diﬀerent than
in Pirozzoli et al. (2018). In that paper the terms in the streamwise velocity budget were presented,
showing good independence on the Reynolds number. Compared to that result, the present plots at
Re = 5000 emphasise the large diﬀerences at intermediate Re between the terms in the U1 equation
and those of the secondary motion, described by the U2 and U3 equations. To account for the high
levels of U +

weakness of the secondary motion with respect to the mean streamwise motion. The convective C+

4. Rectangular ducts
4.0.1. Friction factor

We previously mentioned that in rectangular channels the Reynolds number based on the short side
half length marks the transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime. To demonstrate that Cf
has a nearly universal behavior with Re3 both in the laminar and in the turbulent regime, in ﬁgure 16
we show the maps of Cf versus the three Reynolds number indicated in table 1. The common feature
is that satisfactory collapse of the data occurs in the fully turbulent regime, regardless of the deﬁnition
of the Reynolds number. On the other hand, in the laminar regime the poorest scaling is obtained
with Re (ﬁgure 16a), which may be understood because the choice of a reference length based on the
radius of an equivalent pipe does not account for the shape of the duct. In the three ﬁgures, lines
with the same colour as the solid symbols are evaluated from the analytical expression (3-48) given at
Pg.113 of White (1974). Also the classical Reynolds number based on the hydraulic diameter is not
suitable to account for the shape of the duct cross section, as may be inferred from ﬁgure 16b. On
the other hand, the choice of the short side as the reference length yields good collapse both in the
laminar and in the turbulent regime. Regardless of the aspect ratio, the transitional Reynolds number

850, as may be seen in the inset of ﬁgure 16c. In this ﬁgure it may be noticed that
the behavior for AR = 1 (the red solid symbols) is a bit diﬀerent, which probably implies that the
absence of symmetry about the corner bisector in rectangular ducts generates stronger disturbances
due to the secondary motion, which cause earlier transition.

4.0.2. Wall friction proﬁles

Contours of the secondary stream function and proﬁles of the wall shear stress along the perimeter of
rectangular ducts, similar to those given in ﬁgure 4 for square ducts, may provide insight to understand
the inﬂuence of the aspect ratio. Simulations at Re = 5000 are appropriate for this purpose. In all

in a region of equal size in the vertical and horizontal directions a change in the strength of the
recirculating regions may be appreciated. The recirculating region near the short vertical wall reduces
in size and strength. On the other hand the recirculating region near the horizontal wall increases in
size and strength. This asymmetry causes the formation of strong disturbances propagating from the
corner towards the central region, which explains why the critical Reynolds number in square ducts is
higher than that in rectangular ducts. The growth of the stronger recirculating and the location of the

maximum is ﬁxed, which suggests that L3 is the appropriate length scale at low Reynolds numbers.
However, transition to the turbulent regime does not occur without the small recirculating region near
the short side. This was observed in similar plots at Re = 2500, and is corroborated by the Cf plots
of ﬁgure 16, where the black dots corresponding to AR = 7 at Re = 2500 are aligned with the laminar
values. Although barely visible in the proﬁles of τw(s) for AR = 7, at Re
2500 there is only one peak
in the short side, whereas at Re = 5000 there are two peaks which are generated by the secondary
recirculating regions near the short side. At Re = 2500, AR = 6, two peaks with small undulation are
produced, which is enough to have the Cf in ﬁgure 16 no longer aligned with the laminar value. At
AR = 5 the two peaks are visible in ﬁgure 17 of τw(s) at Re = 2500, hence the corresponding value of
Cf in ﬁgure 16 coincides with the values of the simulations with smaller aspect ratio. At AR = 5 the
proﬁles of τw(s) only have one peak in the short side at Re = 1750, which is found also for AR = 4,
and two peaks ﬁnally form for AR = 2 as conﬁrmed in ﬁgure 16a, where at Re = 1750 the value of
Cf is not aligned with the laminar trend.

4.0.3. Mean ﬂow

1 , q+ ω+

The ﬂow near the corner in rectangular ducts does not change dramatically from the case of square
ducts. Contours of U +
1 and ψ+ in the corner regions are shown in ﬁgure 18, at ﬁxed Re = 5000,
for diﬀerent values of the aspect ratio, superimposed to each other to have a global picture of whether
the behavior is drastically aﬀected. The two space coordinates and all quantities are here scaled
with the averaged friction velocity. The contours of U +
(ﬁgure 18a) are superimposed each other,
1
especially near walls, whereas some diﬀerence may be appreciated far from the walls near the shorter
side. Increasing the aspect ratio to AR = 4 the U +
1 = 14 iso-line (red) moves parallel towards the
central region. Further increasing AR, the U +
1 = 14 iso-line near the bisector moves towards the short
side of the duct. In the long side region the contours are ﬂat near the wall, and undulations appear
far from the wall. The turbulent kinetic energy distributions near the walls are independent of the
aspect ratio, as shown by the green lines (q+ = 1) in ﬁgure 18b. On the other hand, the blue contours
(q+ = 3), in the long side region move far from the corner by increasing AR. In this region, also the
black contours (q+ = 2) shrink indicating large variations of the turbulent kinetic energy distribution.
In the short side region small variations are see in ﬁgure 18b. This behavior might be ascribed to
the eﬀect of the secondary motion, but in fact the contours of ω+
1 in ﬁgure 18c show only marginal
variation with AR. This vorticity component is linked to the small scales in the near-wall region. The
strong vorticity layers attached to the horizontal and vertical walls are found to scale well with the
averaged friction velocity. The large scale secondary motion depicted through the stream function in
ﬁgure 18d, consists on two recirculating regions of diﬀerent size, the bigger one along the long side.
It is important to stress that asymmetry only appears only for AR > 1, and in agreement with the
previous discussion, disappears at AR = 1.

the previous ﬁndings about good scaling in wall units of mean motion, turbulence and budgets in a

to emphasise the behavior near the corner, whereas linear scales are used here to also analyse the
behavior far from the corner.

It is thus worth analysing whether mean and turbulent quantities also scale with the mean friction
= 1. A rectangular duct with AR = 7 has been considered to compare the distribution
velocity for AR 6
of the various quantities with those in ﬁgure 20, at Re = 7750 and Re = 15000. However, for AR = 7,
Re = 2500, the ﬂow is laminar, as may be argued from the Cf shown in ﬁgure 16a (black dots). On
the other hand, turbulent ﬂow is found at AR = 6, Re = 2500, thus in ﬁgure 21 we show the behavior
of the quantities at Re = 2500 for AR = 6. At this low Re the choice to analyse a 100+
100+
box around the corner leads to a vertical size in the top panels of ﬁgure 21 which is shorter than
the horizontal one, in fact L+
2 /2 = 367. These diﬀerences, in particular in the
turbulent kinetic energy, lead to diﬀerent distributions close to the horizontal and vertical walls. The
blue line in ﬁgure 21b, corresponding to q+ = 1, near the vertical wall is localised in a smaller region
than that near the horizontal wall. This is corroborated by the contours of P +

near the walls. Indeed, both the contours of U +
1 and q+ in the middle panels show better symmetry
around the corner bisector. Symmetry is further supported by the distributions of the three terms
in the turbulent kinetic energy budget, which are very similar to those at the same Re in ﬁgure 20.
Visualizations in a wider region show that at larger wall distances than 100+, all quantities do not
change, and behave similarly near walls. This explains why Cf in the fully turbulent regime scales
well regardless of the deﬁnition of Reynolds number. At Re = 15000, L+
3 /2 = 310, hence in bottom
ﬁgures the contours close to the corners show better symmetry than that at Re = 7750. From ﬁgure 21
it may be asserted that at high Reynolds number, that is in the fully turbulent regime, mean and
turbulent motion scale well with the averaged friction velocity also for rectangular ducts. Under these
conditions, the corrections caused by the corner are concentrated in a small region, and large part
of the duct is occupied by turbulent ﬂow not diﬀerent from a canonical planar channel. Completely
diﬀerent is the behavior near the transitional Reynolds number, in which the corner bisector symmetry
is lost. In ducts with high aspect ratios, the near-wall structures are constrained near the short side,
thus turbulence is not sustained, and although the other side is long enough, q+ remains nearly zero.

5. Concluding remarks

In this paper have been reported the results of DNS in rectangular ducts with diﬀerent aspect ratio
in the laminar, transitional and fully turbulent regimes. The case with AR = 1, the square duct,
largely investigated in real and numerical experiments has been considered to validate the numerical
method. The results compared well with those available in literature. A particular emphasis has been
directed in the transitional regime showing the formation of a secondary motion consisting in four
recirculating regions instead that the eight characteristic of the fully turbulent regime. In presence
of four regions the Cf , even if greater than that should be found without secondary motion decays
linearly with the Reynolds number as in the laminar regime. Going from four to eight regions the
proﬁles of τw from the corner increase with a behavior rather diﬀerent and reaching at high Reynolds
numbers a constant proﬁle in a large part of the duct. In addition it has been found that the strength
of the secondary motion is large at low and decreases by increasing the Reynolds number. Therefore
at low Re the secondary motion can be of interest to increase the mixing or the heat transfer. At
high Re the reduction of the strength and the shrinking of the secondary motion in a small region
near the corner leads to a behavior of the Cf as well as the proﬁles of the mean motion and the
turbulent statistics similar to those in the canonical two-dimensional channel. At high Re there is not
large diﬀerence on the deﬁnition of the reference length in plotting the Cf versus the bulk Reynolds
number. On the other hand, in particular in presence of rectangular ducts with AR > 1 the transitional
Reynolds number is independent of the aspect ratio by taking as reference length half of the smaller
side. Having observed that for the square duct the critical Re is diﬀerent from that for AR > 1 it has
been argued that for the ducts with AR > 1 the asymmetric disturbances emanating from the corner
act as a trip device.

Whose interested to apply RANS closures to simulate ﬂows in practical applications for rectangular
ducts are aware of the diﬃculties to reproduce the anisotropy and the asymmetries of the turbulent
Reynolds stresses. In this paper it has been shown that by taking as reference system that oriented
along the eigenvectors of the strain tensor instead of the Cartesian reference frame the anisotropy of
the Reynolds stresses is reduced and the normal stresses are symmetric with respect the diagonal.
This can be an useful results in constructing more reliable RANS closures. The further result that
the behavior of the total dissipation is simpler to model than the isotropic rate of turbulent kinetic
energy could be useful in RANS closures.

In rectangular ducts at high Reynolds numbers it has been found that the mean motion, the turbu-
lent kinetic energy as well as its budget in wall units scale rather well with the Reynolds number and
with the aspect ratio in the region near the corner. At low Re the short side plays an important role,
if the friction Reynolds number evaluated by the short side is low the turbulence can not be sustained
and the ﬂows remains laminar.
