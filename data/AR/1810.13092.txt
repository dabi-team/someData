ABSTRACT

We study the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in the active region (AR) 12673 that produced the largest

solar ﬂare in the past decade on 2017 September 6. Fast ﬂux emergence is one of the most prominent

features of this AR. We calculate the magnetic helicity from photospheric tangential ﬂows that shear

and braid ﬁeld lines (shear-helicity), and from normal ﬂows that advect twisted magnetic ﬂux into the

corona (emergence-helicity), respectively. Our results show that the emergence-helicity accumulated

in the corona is −1.6 × 1043 Mx2 before the major eruption, while the shear-helicity accumulated in

the corona is −6 × 1043 Mx2, which contributes about 79% of the total helicity. The shear-helicity

ﬂux is dominant throughout the overall investigated emergence phase. Our results imply that the

emerged ﬁelds initially contain relatively low helicity. Much more helicity is built up by shearing and

converging ﬂows acting on preexisted and emerging ﬂux. Shearing motions are getting stronger with

the ﬂux emergence, and especially on both sides of the polarity inversion line of the core ﬁeld region.

The evolution of the vertical currents shows that most of the intense currents do not appear initially

with the emergence of the ﬂux, which implies that most of the emerging ﬂux is probably not strongly

current-carrying. The helical magnetic ﬁelds (ﬂux rope) in the core ﬁeld region are probably formed

by long-term photospheric motions. The shearing and converging motions are continuously generated

driven by the ﬂux emergence. AR 12673 is a representative as photospheric motions contribute most

of the nonpotentiality in the AR with vigorous ﬂux emergence.

1. INTRODUCTION

3

Magnetic ﬁelds are believed to play a fundamental role in producing solar ﬂares and coronal mass

ejections (CMEs) that have drawn the majority of scientiﬁc interest due to their signiﬁcant impact

on the space weather. Magnetic ﬁelds form magnetic structures in the solar coronal which are

associated with plasma motions in the photosphere. Photospheric motions can perturb the magnetic

structures by shearing or converging ﬁeld lines relatively to the polarity inversion line (PIL; e.g.,

Moore et al. 2001; van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989), thereby drive the magnetic reconnection in

the corona. Photospheric shearing motions are one of the possible way to introduce strong electric

currents and inject energy into the active region (AR) corona (e.g, Sun et al. 2012). Photospheric

motions are generally formed due to convection and diﬀerential rotation. In an emerging ﬂux region,

horizontal divergent ﬂows are often observed before the ﬂux emergence. Toriumi et al. (2012) found

the horizontal ﬂows are associated with the rising ﬂux tube below the photosphere. They indicated

that as the rising tube approaches the photosphere, the accumulated plasma on the rising tube

escapes horizontally around the surface and is observed as a horizontal divergent ﬂow. On the other

hand, simulations show that emergence of suﬃciently twisted ﬂux rope structures can also drive

photospheric motions (e.g., rotational or shearing motions; Manchester et al. 2004; Magara 2006;

Manchester 2007; Fan 2009; Fang et al. 2012). The basic underlying reason is the nature of the

Lorentz force. Magara & Longcope (2003) by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical simulation

found that ﬂux emergence generates not only vertical but also horizontal ﬂows in the photosphere,

both of which contribute to injecting magnetic energy and magnetic helicity. The contributions

of vertical ﬂows are dominant at the early phase of ﬂux emergence, while horizontal ﬂows become

a dominant contributor later. Consistently, in the early emergence phase, the ﬂux of helicity and

magnetic energy are both dominated from the contributions of vertical ﬂows that advect twisted

magnetic ﬂux into the corona; in the later phases of ﬂux emergence, both quantities are dominated

by horizontal ﬂows that shear and braid ﬁeld lines over a longer time period. Here, we need to note

that the magnetic ﬂux tube in their simulation is initially twisted before it emerges into the solar

atmosphere. The observations in Liu & Schuck (2012) show that the magnetic energy in the corona

4

Wang et al.

is contributed mainly by vertical ﬂows, while magnetic helicity is mainly contributed by horizontal

ﬂows for their investigated ARs.

The AR 12673 on 2017 September 6 produced the largest solar ﬂare (X9.3) in the past decade

and was associated with a major coronal mass ejection (CME). About three hours before the ﬂare,

another weaker X-class ﬂare took place in the same region. Moreover, according to the investigations

of Yang et al. (2017), this AR had already produced 12 M-class ﬂares during the two days before

the two X-class ﬂares. The occurrences of solar eruptions are related to magnetic energy release.

Eruptions associated with X-class ﬂares are generally accompanied by much more magnetic free

energy release than other eruptions (e.g., Jing et al. 2010; Su et al. 2014).

It is interesting that

the occurrences of the two X-class ﬂare eruptions are within only three hours, and the second ﬂare

is decade-class as well. Figure 1a shows the AR magnetic free energy calculated by subtracting

the potential ﬁeld energy (Seehafer 1978) from the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) energy (see

below). The time resolution of the free energy time series is 12 minutes for 18 hours. The energy

has a stepwise decrease after the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare eruption then increases before the major eruption,

which implies that the nonpotential energy is accumulated rapidly. This should be related to the

continuous ﬂux emergence. The AR experienced the fastest ﬂux emergence three days before the

major eruption (see Figure 1a). An extraordinary ﬂux emergence rate of 1.12+0.15

−0.05 × 1021Mx hr−1 on

September 3 was measured by Sun & Norton (2017), which accumulates free energy rapidly for the

later eruptions. Persistent ﬂux emergence, apparent coalescence, cancelation, and shearing motions

are followed. The whole AR is in a rapid evolving state. Total unsigned vertical current is increasing

with the unsigned magnetic ﬂux (Figure 1b). Helical magnetic structures (i.e., a ﬂux rope) is thought

to exist prior to the major eruption (Yang et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2018). The helicity or twist of the
AR can be estimated by the proxy mean twist parameter α derived as α ∝ P Jz·Bz
P Bz

(Pevtsov et al.

2

1994; Hagino & Sakurai 2004), that has been a popular quantity to correlate with the occurrence of

solar energetic events (Vemareddy & Zhang 2014; Bobra & Ilonidis 2016). Similar as the unsigned

ﬂux, α in Figure 1c also exhibits an increasing trend. The increases of the vertical current and the

twist parameter α are apparently related to the fast ﬂux emergence.

In this paper, we investigate the buildup of the nonpotentiality in the core of the AR 12673.

The evolution of the AR magnetic ﬁeld by photospheric motions and ﬂux emergence before the

major eruption may help us to understand how the magnetic nonpotentiality builds up and what

is the dominant contributor to the major eruption. That is important for predicting disastrous

space-weather events. The evolution of the eruptive ﬁlaments is presented in Section 2 by the

EUV observations and the magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation results.

In Section 3 we investigate the

nonpotentiality of the AR by analysis of the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds. Discussions and conclusions

are given in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND MAGNETIC FIELD EXTRAPOLATIONS

NOAA AR 12673 (S09W42) produced two successive X-class ﬂares on 2017 September 6. The ﬁrst

X2.2 ﬂare started at 08:57 UT, peaked at 09:10 UT, ended at 09:17 UT, and was accompanied by

a faint CME. The second X9.3 ﬂare started at 11:53 UT, peaked at 12:02 UT, ended at 12:10 UT,

and was accompanied by a strong halo CME. For comparison, two successive X-class ﬂares occurred

from the AR 11429 on 2012 March 7 in the same solar cycle (Wang et al. 2014), each of which was

associated with a fast CME (Liu et al. 2013, 2014c).

Figures 2a and 2b exhibit the typical stages of the ﬁrst eruption using the EUV images in the

304 ˚A channel from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar

Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). The northern part in Figure 2a (blue dotted lines)

ﬁrst rises and ﬁnally erupts. Figure 2b shows that the rising structure (black dashed lines) expands

gradually. Figure 2a shows that the EUV brigtenings appear between the northern part (blue dotted

lines) and the inverse S-shaped EUV feature (green dotted line). The RHESSI (Lin et al. 2002) X-ray

sources in Figure 2a are consistent with the EUV brightenings. It is worth noting that the X-ray

sources are spread to the south along the magnetic PIL (RHESSI contours in Figure 2b) when the

ﬂare develops near its peak time. The position of the reconnection signatures changes probably due to

involvement of diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld lines into the energy release process (e.g., Priest & Longcope

2017; Zimovets et al. 2018). The brightening in Figure 2a may correspond to the initial reconnection

by footpoint motions, and the one in Figure 2b may be related to the reconnection beneath the rising

6

Wang et al.

plasmoid. Unfortunately, RHESSI missed the second major ﬂare. The AIA 171 ˚A in Figure 2c shows

the post ﬂare arcades (PFA) above the PIL. The PFA still looks sheared which is probably inherited

from the inner overlying ﬂux tubes of the pre-eruption conﬁguration. Yan et al. (2018) indicated

that a CME emerging from LASCO C2 is associated with the inverse S-shaped structure. Although

the AR 12673 experiences a release of magnetic free energy in the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare, it still possesses

strong nonpotentiality.

The middle row in Figure 2 shows the observations at AIA 304 ˚A prior to the major eruption.

The EUV brightening (see Figure 2d) ﬁrst appears near the PIL. Considering the projection eﬀect

(the AR is located at S09W42), we think that the brightening is probably above the PIL. Later on,

the ﬁlament begins to rise (Figure 2e). Figure 2f shows that an EUV structure with helical pattern

erupts and the overall region along the PIL between the footpoints of the structure is brightened.

The helical structure should be the erupting ﬁlament. Yang et al. (2017) suggested that a kink knot

structure exhibited later on near the apex of the helical structure is an observational evidence of the

kink instability. Figure 2g shows an arcade structure at 131 ˚A above the initial brightening. Then,

the footpoints of the arcade begins to be brightened (Figure 2h). Magnetic reconnection probably

occurs at these brightening by the interaction between the core ﬁelds and the overlying magnetic

ﬁelds along the PIL. Figure 2i shows the overall shape of the rising ﬁlament at 94 ˚A as shown by the

red dotted line. The major eruption seems to occur almost in the same region as the ﬁrst one after

a three-hour time interval, which implies that there exists a large amount of free energy.

Figure 3 shows the reconstructed ﬂux-rope structure at diﬀerent times using the NLFFF extrapola-

tion method (Wiegelmann 2004). Here, we apply this NLFFF method to an area of 280′′ × 220′′. The

spatial resolution is 1′′.0 per pixel. We show some arbitrarily chosen force-free ﬁeld lines along the

PIL to compare with the AIA images at diﬀerent wavelengths. Figures 3a and 3b show the ﬂux-rope

structures at 08:36 UT before the ﬁrst eruption. The ﬂux rope seems to stay lower from a side view.

The bundle of grey ﬁeld lines corresponds to the inverse S-shaped structures (green dotted line) in

Figure 2a. The green ﬁeld lines match the northern part (blue dotted lines in Figure 2a) in the EUV

image. Figures 3c-3f show the ﬂux-rope structures at 11:36 UT prior to the major eruption. The

AASTEX artical

7

height of the ﬂux rope seems higher than that before the ﬁrst eruption, and it is more curved. Figure

3f shows a bundle of twisted overlying ﬁelds (cyan lines) above the ﬂux rope, which seems, in general,

to be consistent with the EUV arcades in Figures 2g and 2h. The south footpoints of the cyan ﬁeld

lines are just located around the EUV brightening in Figure 2h. We do not think that the grey

sigmoid structure (Figure 3a) fully erupted during the ﬁrst eruption, since the twisted rope structure

is reconstructed in almost the same region after the eruption. The two eruptions occur successively

within only a three-hour time interval. It is possible that the ﬁrst one is a partial eruption, when just

a part of the overall magnetic structure presented has erupted. The observed erupted structures in

the EUV images (blue dotted and black dashed lines in Figures 2a and 2b) may merely correspond

to the bundle of green ﬁeld lines and parts of the grey lines in Figures 3a and 3b. Additionally, the

ﬁrst CME presented by Yan et al. (2018) was much weaker and slower.

3. EVOLUTION OF MAGNETIC NONPOTENTIALITY

3.1. Distributions of vertical currents and photospheric motions

The nonpotential nature of magnetic ﬁelds is a measure of AR eruptivity and reveals the connection

of photospheric magnetic motions with the energy buildup in the AR. The Helioseismic and Magnetic

Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) provides a data product called Space-weather

HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs; Bobra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2014). The SHARP data

provide vector magnetograms with a pixel scale of about 0′′.5 and a cadence of 12 minutes. Figure 4

shows radial and tangential components of the magnetic ﬁelds and vertical currents (Jz) distributions

in the core ﬁeld region of the AR 12673. The magnetic transverse vectors are seen to be nearly aligned

with the PIL, which implies a large shear along the interface of the two opposite magnetic polarities

(Zhang 2001). Owing to the strong shear in the transverse ﬁeld vectors, the PIL generally spreads

with intense vertical current (Jz) distribution (e.g., Vemareddy et al. 2012; Sharykin & Kosovichev

2014; Janvier et al. 2014; Sharykin et al. 2015). The intense Jz here is represented by the yellow and
z = -150 mA m−2). From Figures 4d-4f it

blue contours (vertical currents J +

z = 150 mA m−2 and J −

can be seen that enhanced electric currents are distributed mainly around the PIL (red curve). The

8

Wang et al.

intense Jz around the PIL had already existed before 02:00 UT on September 6 (Figure 4d). High

gradients of the vertical current density, due to a change of sign on small spatial scales, appeared a

short time before the two eruptions, which implies that the opposite polarities are pressed against

each other in a compact conﬁguration (see C1 and C2 in Figures 4e and 4f). The ﬁeld vectors in

the top panels are pointing from negative polarity to positive polarity later in the evolution (by

the green arrow in Figure 4b), which indicates signiﬁcant twist. This gives trouble to the magnetic

ﬁeld disambiguation. Due to the systematic errors and limitations induced by the orbital and other

factors, the inversion and disambiguation methods for processing the SHARP data fail in the middle

of the umbrae and the north of the negative polarity (pixels of poor quality within the cyan circles).

Figure 5a shows that the prominent magnetic motion (derived by DAVE4VM of Schuck 2008) of

the negative polarity is northeastward. It forms shearing motions with the southeastward ﬂows in

the positive polarity in the central part of the core region considered. Prior to the ﬁrst eruption,

the motions of the overall region are enhanced as shown in Figure 5b. The northeastward motion

of the negative polarity is getting northward along the PIL. In addition, the southeastward ﬂows

in the positive polarity make the two opposite magnetic polarities closer and the PIL more curved.

The southward components of the southeastward ﬂows shear with the northward motion of the

negative polarity. The northern part of the negative polarity intrudes into the positive one, and

forms the so-called “Magnetic Tongues” that resemble the yin yang pattern, which implies the

magnetic ﬁelds along the PIL are twisted (Luoni et al. 2011). After the ﬁrst eruption (see Figure 5c),

the southeastward ﬂows in the positive polarity are getting southward, and becomes more parallel

to the PIL and more sheared with the northward motion of the negative polarity. About 20 minutes

before the major eruption (Figure 5d), the southeastward ﬂows turn perpendicular to the PIL, and

the motion of the negative polarity becomes more parallel to the PIL. It means that the positive

polarity is converging to the negative one, and moving perpendicular to the direction of the shearing

motion of the negative polarity. This reminds us of the model of van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989)

to form helical ﬂux-rope structures. Shearing motions produce the sheared magnetic ﬁelds, and

converging motions make the magnetic shears further increase and cause the reconnection between

AASTEX artical

9

the sheared ﬁeld lines. On Figure 5d we overplot the outline of EUV brightening shown in Figure 2d.

It is just located on the path of the major converging ﬂows near the PIL and near the high gradients

of the vertical current density shown in Figure 4f as C2. Magnetic reconnection may occur around

this region. We estimate that the location of the brightening can be above the PIL by assuming the

brightening occurs in the chromosphere when considering that the AR is at W42◦ in longitude.

We also present the normal velocity derived from DAVE4VM. The blue (red) contours in Figure 6

represent the upﬂows (downﬂows). The upﬂows are related to the ﬂux emergence. Figure 6 shows

that the upﬂows are enhanced before the two eruptions surrounding the major sunspot, which reveals

that ﬂux emergence becomes strong before the eruptions. This is consistent with the changes of the

total unsigned ﬂux in Figure 1a. At 08:36 UT, upﬂows appear in the northern part of the PIL close

to the high gradients of vertical current density C1 in Figure 4e. Strong downﬂows also appear along

the PIL, which should be related to submergence of magnetic ﬂux, i.e. ﬂux cancelation (Rabin et al.

1984; Martin et al. 1985). The submergence of the ﬂux continues even after the ﬁrst eruption (see

Figure 6c). van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989) indicated that the cancelation is probably the result

of ﬂux motions. At 11:36 UT (see Figure 6d), upﬂows appear next to the projection of the EUV

brightening.

It seems that there are some relations between the upﬂows and the horizontal motions in position.

For instance, strong upﬂows are found at the south of the major northeastward motion of the negative

polarity (see Figures 5a and 6a). The upﬂows near C1 is connected to the horizontal ﬂow around C1

(see Figures 5b and 6b). Also, the sheared ﬂows along the PIL in the positive polarity at 09:36 UT is

connected to the upﬂows at the north of the sunspot (see Figures 5c and 6c). Toriumi et al. (2012)

has indicated that the buoyant rise of magnetic ﬁeld toward the solar surface can drive horizontal

ﬂows that are an integral part of the ﬂux emergence process. The magnetic ﬁeld lines rooted on

the photosphere could be dragged with the plasma moving horizontally. Thus, the upﬂows around

the EUV brightening may explain why the continuous southeastward ﬂows in the positive polarity

change to perpendicular to the PIL.

Wang et al.

3.2. Magnetic helicity and vertical currents

Solar eruptions are thought to occur due to an overaccumulation of magnetic helicity (e.g.,

Nindos & Andrews 2004; Vemareddy et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014). Photospheric motions and ﬂux

emergence can both inject magnetic helicity by shearing footpoints of magnetic ﬁeld lines and ad-

vecting twisted magnetic ﬂux, respectively. As presented in Figures 5 and 6, the core region of AR

12673 experiences both relatively strong shearing motions and ﬂux emergence. It is hard to draw

an immediate conclusion whether the magnetic helicity is dominated by the shearing motions or

emergence of twisted ﬂux. Berger & Field (1984) derived the Poynting-like theorem for the helicity

ﬂux through a surface S:

dH
dt

=

ZS

2(Bt · Ap)vndS +

ZS

−2(vt · Ap)BndS,

(1)

where Ap is the vector potential of the magnetic ﬁeld derived by the SHARP vector magnetogram,

which is calculated by means of the fast Fourier transform method as implemented by Chae (2001),

Bt and Bn denote the tangential and normal magnetic ﬁelds, vn and vt are the photospheric normal

and tangential velocity ﬁelds derived by DAVE4VM. We calculate the two terms in the equation 1,

respectively, which is implemented as Liu & Schuck (2012). The ﬁrst term indicates that the magnetic

helicity in the corona comes from the twisted magnetic ﬂux tubes emerging from the solar interior

into the corona (emergence-term hereafter). The second term represents the helicity generated by

shearing the ﬁeld lines by the photospheric motions on the solar surface (shear-term hereafter).

Figure 7 shows temporal proﬁles of helicity ﬂuxes across the photosphere and accumulated helicities

for the entire AR. Red and blue curves in the top panel represent the helicity ﬂux from vt (shear-

helicity ﬂux hereafter) and from vn (emergence-helicity ﬂux hereafter), respectively. Red and blue

curves in the bottom panel refer to the accumulated helicities from the shear- and emergence- helicity

ﬂuxes, respectively. The accumulated helicity is the integral of the helicity ﬂux over time, which is

deemed to be the helicity stored in the corona. We adopt the SHARP vector magnetograms as the

input data for calculating the velocity by DAVE4VM and the vector potential Ap, and the time

resolution is 1 hour for 4.75 days (114 hours) from 00:00 UT on September 2. Figure 7a shows that

AASTEX artical

11

the shear-helicity ﬂux is dominant starting from September 3. The emergence-helicity ﬂux, on the

other hand, remained at a relatively low level for this period. Both helicities are negative. This is in

opposition to the so-called hemisphere rule, which predicts that ARs in the southern hemisphere have

positive helicity (Pevtsov et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2014b). The shear-helicity accumulated in the corona

before the major eruption is −6 ×1043 Mx2; the emergence-helicity accumulated in the corona is only

−1.6 × 1043 Mx2. The helicities are relatively high in the emerging AR (refer to Liu et al. 2014a).

The shear-term contributes about 79% of the total helicity, while the emergence-term contributes

only about 21%. Our results imply that most of the magnetic helicity of the AR is probably built up

by the horizontal motions. The twisted ﬂux emerging from the subphotosphere contributes to the

magnetic helicity much less than the horizontal motions.

Vertical currents in the photosphere are one of the most commonly used measures of magnetic

nonpotentiality. Twists or shears by photospheric motions can cause the formation of these currents

(e.g., Melrose 1991; Zhang 2001; Dalmasse et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016). Also, large currents can

emerge with the rising current-carrying twisted ﬂux from the subphotosphere (e.g., Leka et al. 1996;

T¨or¨ok et al. 2014; Cheung & Isobe 2014). As presented in Figures 4 and 5, the intense vertical

currents are distributed along the PIL where the transverse ﬁeld vectors are sheared, and probably

connected with the photospheric motions. However, it is also possible that the intense currents are

carried by the emerging ﬂux. The emergence-helicity can be considered as a proxy for quantifying the

amount of emerging current-carrying twisted ﬂux. Thereby, we expect to use the spatial distribution

of the helicity ﬂux to identify the major contributor to the intense vertical currents.

In Figure 8, we use the spatial distribution of GA (dH/dt =

S GA(x, y)dS, where GA = 2[(Bt ·
R
Ap)vn − (vt · Ap)Bn]) to represent helicity ﬂux densities before the major eruption. The ﬁrst and

second terms of GA represent the emergence- and shear-helicity ﬂux densities, respectively. White

(black) patches refer to a positive (negative) sign of helicity ﬂux, and we scaled the maps within

±1020Mx2 cm−2 s−1 so that all magnetic elements are visible. We use the blue (red) contours to

represent the intense positive (negative) helicity ﬂux. The top panels show that the intense shear-

helicity ﬂux as expected is distributed on both sides of the PIL, and the helicity ﬂux of negative sign

12

Wang et al.

is dominant. The intense emergence-helicity ﬂux is also distributed around the PIL, but, in contrast,

it is much weaker. Additionally, the emergence-helicity ﬂux calculated includes the ﬂux from both

upﬂows and downﬂows (refer to the implementations by Liu & Schuck 2012). The real helicity ﬂux

associated with the emerging current-carrying ﬂux should be less than what we show.

The proﬁle of the shear-helicity ﬂux of the entire AR correlates well with the total unsigned vertical

currents (cf. Figures 7 and 1b). We make a further investigation on the relation between the shear-

helicity and the distribution of the vertical currents, and present the distributions of the vertical

currents and vector magnetic ﬁelds in the earlier phase of the emergence in Figure 9. On September

3, the AR experienced the fastest ﬂux emergence, and the distribution of the vertical current was

dispersed (see Figures 9a and 9d). When two major opposite polarities begin to touch, intense vertical

currents appear around the touching places. With more parts of the two polarities are pressed against

each other, longer intense current contours appear on both sides of the PIL. Obviously, the intense

vertical currents are formed due to the converging motions that press the opposite polarities together

in a compact conﬁguration. The magnetic ﬁeld strength is enhanced and the magnetic ﬁelds become

sheared along the PIL. On the other hand, we also present the distributions of helicity ﬂuxes at the

corresponding times in Figure 10. In order to compare with the helicity ﬂuxes in Figure 8, we still

scaled the maps within ±1020Mx2 cm−2 s−1. The shear-helicity ﬂux is still dominant in the earlier

phase of the ﬂux emergence. The intense shear-helicity ﬂux distributed around the PIL increases

with the content of the intense vertical currents, which also reveals the close relation between the

photospheric motions and the vertical currents.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

AR 12673 produced very strong energy release on 2017 September 6 that has drawn great scientiﬁc

attention due to the intense ﬂare as well as the signiﬁcant impact on the space weather. One

of the most prominent features is the fast ﬂux emergence process that even continues after the

major eruption, and the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds experience fast evolving processes. Using

HMI SHARP vector magnetic ﬁeld data, we studied the helicity in the corona. The emergence-

helicity accumulated in the corona is −1.6 × 1043 Mx2 before the major eruption, while the shear-

AASTEX artical

13

helicity accumulated in the corona is −6 × 1043 Mx2, which contributes about 79% of the total

helicity. The shear-helicity ﬂux is dominant from the beginning of the ﬂux emergence to the major

eruption, and the situation continues after the eruption. This is consistent with the conclusion of

Liu & Schuck (2012) that the magnetic helicity is mainly contributed by the horizontal ﬂows for

their investigated ARs. However, our observational results are diﬀerent from the results obtained by

the MHD simulations (Manchester et al. 2004; Magara 2006; Manchester 2007; Fan 2009; Fang et al.

2012), that the emergence-helicity is dominant in the early emergence phase, and the shear-helicity

is dominant later. Our results imply that the emerged ﬁelds initially contain relatively low helicity.

Much more helicity is built up by shearing and converging ﬂows acting on the preexisted or emerging

ﬂux. We tend to believe that parts of the shearing ﬂows come from horizontal divergent ﬂow due to

the rising ﬂux in the subphotosphere, since the proﬁle of the shear-helicity ﬂux correlate well with

the total unsigned ﬂux, and the distributions of horizontal ﬂows of the ﬂux appear to connect with

the vertical ﬂows.

Our results show that the intense vertical currents are mainly distributed along the PIL where the

magnetic ﬁelds are sheared. The evolution of the vertical currents also shows that most of the intense

currents do not appear initially with the emergence of the ﬂux, which implies that this emerging ﬂux is

probably not strongly current-carrying, i.e., ﬁeld lines are not twisted strongly in the early emergence

phase. This is consistent with our conclusion from the study of the magnetic helicity. On the other

hand, we ﬁnd that the intense vertical currents appear on both sides of the PIL as two opposite

magnetic polarities are pressed against each other. Shearing motions are getting stronger with the

ﬂux emergence, especially on both sides of the PIL of the core ﬁeld region formed by the coalescence

of the magnetic polarities after September 3, which is reﬂected in the shear-helicity ﬂux. Therefore,

the vertical currents on both sides of the PIL in the core ﬁeld region are mainly contributed by the

photospheric motions. The presence of intense vertical current quantiﬁes the twist and shear of the

magnetic ﬁelds. Accordingly, we think that the ﬂux rope in the core ﬁeld region, exhibited by the

extrapolations, is formed by long-term photospheric motions. The converging motions that press

the opposite polarities against each other enhance the extent of magnetic shears and the gradient of

14

magnetic ﬁelds. Zhang (2001) found that the shear and gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld are important

and reﬂect a part of the electric current in solar ARs.

The shearing and converging motions are continuously generated driven by the ﬂux emergence.

Magnetic reconnection probably occurs in the way of van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989) by shearing

and converging motions. The twist of the magnetic ﬁeld increases with time. Figure 1c shows that

the mean twist α of the entire AR reach a high value of ∼ −0.10 Mm−1 before the eruptions. For

comparison purposes, we also calculated α of other ARs with intense eruptions, e.g., AR 11429:

∼ −0.05 Mm−1, AR 11158: ∼ 0.03 Mm−1, AR 12192: ∼ −0.01 Mm−1. Although the AR has

a strong twist before the eruption, this cannot indicate that the eruption is triggered by the kink

instability, since α has maintained around the high value for a dozen hours before the eruptions.

Therefore, some other mechanisms are necessary to be considered. Photospheric motions or ﬂux

emergence is the potential trigger for the major ﬂare and eruption.

The AR 12673 is a representative as the photospheric motions contribute most of the nonpotentiality

in the AR with vigorous ﬂux emergence. The knowledge to the role of photospheric motions and ﬂux

emergence is important for predicting disastrous space-weather events.

Figure 1. Time evolution of magnetic parameters in the AR 12673. These parameters available on a

twelve-minute cadence are provided by the keywords in the SHARP data series, and used for the AR event

forecasting and for identifying regions of interest (Bobra et al. 2014; Bobra & Ilonidis 2016). The pixels that

contribute to these parameters are selected by examining two data segment maps: BITMAP (≥ 30) and

CONF DISAMBIG (disambiguation noise threshold ≈ 150 G, CONF DISAMBIG = 90, Bobra et al. 2014)

in the SHARP data. (a) Total unsigned ﬂux and magnetic free energy by magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations.
(b) Total unsigned vertical current. (c) Mean twist parameter α. The vertical red lines represent the onset

times of the X-class ﬂares. Uncertainties are overplotted for each of the parameters.
