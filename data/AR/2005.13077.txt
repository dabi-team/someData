ABSTRACT

We observed polarization of the SiO rotational transitions from Orion Source I (SrcI) to probe the
magnetic ﬁeld in bipolar outﬂows from this high mass protostar. Both 43 GHz J=1-0 and 86 GHz
J=2-1 lines were mapped with ∼20 AU resolution, using the Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), respectively. The 28SiO transitions in the ground
vibrational state are a mixture of thermal and maser emission. Comparison of the polarization position
angles in the J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions allows us to set an upper limit on possible Faraday rotation
of 104 radians m−2, which would twist the J=2-1 position angles typically by less than 10 degrees.
The smooth, systematic polarization structure in the outﬂow lobes suggests a well ordered magnetic
ﬁeld on scales of a few hundred AU. The uniformity of the polarization suggests a ﬁeld strength of
∼30 milli-Gauss. It is strong enough to shape the bipolar outﬂow and possibly lead to sub-Keplerian
rotation of gas at the base of the outﬂow. The strikingly high fractional linear polarizations of 80-90%
in the 28SiO v=0 masers require anisotropic pumping. We measured circular polarizations of 60%
toward the strongest maser feature in the v=0 J=1-0 peak. Anisotropic resonant scattering (ARS) is
likely to be responsible for this circular polarization. We also present maps of the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1
maser and several other SiO transitions at higher vibrational levels and isotopologues.

and radio source I (SrcI), are recoiling from one another at ∼ 40 km s−1. Approximately 500 years ago, the projected
separation of the two stars was less than 100 AU on the plane of the sky (Rodr´ıguez et al. 2017). An extensive system
of bullets, bow shocks, and ﬁngers, visible in lines of H2, Feii, and CO, also is centered on Orion-KL, and is estimated
to have an age of 500-1000 years (Bally et al. 2017). Thus, the currently favored paradigm is that SrcI and BN were
ejected from a dynamical decay of a multiple system approximately 500 years ago, and that the ejection of the stars
unbound the surrounding gas and circumstellar disks, creating the ﬁnger system (Rodr´ıguez et al. 2005; G´omez et al.
2008; Zapata et al. 2009; Bally et al. 2011; Goddi et al. 2011b; Zapata et al. 2011a; Bally et al. 2017; Rodr´ıguez et al.
2017).

Although this dynamical decay model has many attractive features, it has diﬃculty explaining a couple of observa-
tional results: (1) SrcI is moving at about half the speed of BN, which is known to be a 10M(cid:12) B star (Gezari et al.
1998; Rodr´ıguez et al. 2005). Thus, by conservation of momentum, SrcI is expected to have a mass of roughly 20M(cid:12)
(Bally et al. 2011; Goddi et al. 2011b). Although recent high angular resolution observations of the rotation curve of
H2O and salt lines imply a central mass of 15M(cid:12) (Ginsburg et al. 2018), the mass inferred from observations of many
other molecules, including 0.5 milli-arcsecond (mas) resolution observations of SiO masers, tends to be lower, typically
in the range 5-8M(cid:12) (Kim et al. 2008; Matthews et al. 2010; Plambeck & Wright 2016; Hirota et al. 2017; Kim et al.
2019). (2) SrcI launches an 18 km s−1 outﬂow into the surrounding cloud (Plambeck et al. 2009; Greenhill et al. 2013;
Hirota et al. 2017). The outﬂow appears to propagate straight outward along a northeast-southwest (NE-SW) axis,
perpendicular to SrcI’s proper motion. Given that SrcI moving at 12 km s−1, it is unclear why the outﬂow lobes are
not swept back by the ram pressure of the surrounding medium into a C-shape.

These diﬃculties may be resolved if a magnetic ﬁeld plays an important role in controlling the gas dynamics near
SrcI. The magnetic support from such a ﬁeld could aﬀect the rotation curve resulting in underestimate of the enclosed
mass, and could shape an outﬂow straight outward into the surrounding medium. The curved trajectories of SiO masers
at the base of the outﬂow (Matthews et al. 2010; Issaoun et al. 2017) provide tantalizing evidence that magnetic ﬁelds
control the gas kinematics near SrcI. Rotation of the outﬂow inferred from Si18O observations (Hirota et al. 2017)
also hints that the outﬂow is launched by a magneto-centrifugal disk wind. Thus, it is important to investigate the
relationship between outﬂow dynamics and magnetic ﬁeld structure.

SrcI is associated with a cluster of SiO masers, including the 29SiO and 30SiO isotopologues, in various vibrational
levels (Menten & Reid 1995; Chandler & De Pree 1995; Wright & Plambeck 1995; Baudry et al. 1998; Goddi et al.
2009a,b; Niederhofer et al. 2012; Greenhill et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2019). Even in the ground vibrational state, v=0,
the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines are mixture of maser and thermal emission (Chandler & De Pree 1995; Wright & Plambeck
1995; Baudry et al. 1998; Goddi et al. 2009a,b). Polarization of these masers provides a means of probing the magnetic
ﬁeld near SrcI. Using the 45-m radio telescope at Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) with a spatial resolution of 40(cid:48)(cid:48),
Tsuboi et al. (1996) discovered that the 43 GHz v=0 J=1-0 masers were strongly polarized. Subsequently, Plambeck
et al. (2003) mapped the linear polarization of the 86 GHz v=0 J=2-1 masers with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
Association (BIMA) Array with approximately 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) angular resolution.

The BIMA data revealed that linear polarization in the v=0 J=2-1 line was as high as 50% in some velocity ranges
(Plambeck et al. 2003). With 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution, the polarization position angle was found to be nearly uniform across the
source, but was tilted by roughly 30 degrees with respect to the axis of the outﬂow.1 Surprisingly, the position angle
of the J=2-1 linear polarization diﬀered by 70 degrees from that of the J=1-0 line published by Tsuboi et al. (1996).
Plambeck et al. (2003) speculated that Faraday rotation by plasma in the foreground Orion Hii region might plausibly
explain this angular oﬀset; a rotation measure of 3.3 × 104 radians m−2 brought the J=1-0 and J=2-1 position angles
into concordance, and also put the polarization direction along the axis of the outﬂow. However, these observations
had insuﬃcient resolution to probe the magnetic ﬁeld structure on the ∼100 AU scale of the outﬂow launching region.
The theory of maser polarization was worked out by Goldreich et al. (1973) and has been revisited by Watson
(2009), P´erez-S´anchez & Vlemmings (2013), Lankhaar, & Vlemmings (2019), and others. Polarization occurs because
selection rules cause the maser gain to diﬀer for polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The
net polarization may be either parallel or perpendicular to the ﬁeld, depending on the angle between the ﬁeld and
the line of sight, θ. In the simplest case where the excitation mechanism (collisions or radiation) pumps the magnetic
sublevels equally, this transition from parallel to perpendicular occurs around 55 degrees, which is known as the van

outﬂow from the star.

Vleck angle. Key requirements are that the stimulated emission rate R and the net decay rate of the maser transition
state Γ (i.e. including collisions and spontaneous emission) must be much less than the Zeeman splitting gΩ/2π.

Although the above basic theories of maser linear polarization predict the fractional polarization of ∼30% at max-
imum (e.g. P´erez-S´anchez & Vlemmings 2013), a number of maser sources show higher linear polarization, including
SrcI (Tsuboi et al. 1996). This can be explained by the anisotropic maser pumping (e.g. Nedoluha & Watson 1990;
Watson 2009; Lankhaar, & Vlemmings 2019), in which the radiation ﬁeld for maser pumping is anisotropic owing to
the presence of a central star. Furthermore, maser sources sometimes show signiﬁcant levels of circular polarization.
The Zeeman splitting of the maser line in an interstellar/circumstellar magnetic ﬁeld is a possible origin. However,
there are alternative non-Zeeman scenarios such as conversion from the linear to circular polarization as the maser
radiation propagates through a region with a varying magnetic ﬁeld (Wiebe & Watson 1998) and anisotropic resonant
scattering (ARS; Houde et al. 2013; Houde 2014; Chamma et al. 2018).

In this paper, we present the results of Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLA observa-
tions that measure the linear polarization of both the 86 GHz 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 and 43 GHz 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission
from SrcI with 0.05(cid:48)(cid:48) (20 AU) angular resolution, to probe the magnetic ﬁeld morphology in its bipolar outﬂow lobes.
Based on our new results, we discuss possible origins of the above maser polarization mechanism. We also present the
result of polarization measurement for the 86 GHz 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 emission at the base of the outﬂow.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. ALMA

Observations with ALMA were carried out on 2017 October 12 and 17 in the full polarization mode consisting of
2 execution blocks (EBs) for each day. The array was in the C43-10 conﬁguration with 51 antennas, providing the
longest baseline length of 16 km available with ALMA. We used the ALMA band 3 receiver to detect 86 GHz SiO lines
and their isotopologues listed in Table 1. For the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 and v=1 J=2-1 lines, we set up spectral windows
with total bandwidths of 58.6 MHz and spectral resolutions of 122 kHz. For the other transitions, 28SiO v=2 J=2-1,
29SiO v=0 J=2-1, 29SiO v=1 J=2-1, and 30SiO v=0 J=2-1, we employed a coarser resolution of 244 kHz owing to
the limited data rate.

In addition, two broad spectral windows were conﬁgured at 96-99 GHz for continuum emission with to-
tal bandwidths of 1875 MHz each. The tracking center position of SrcI was RA(J2000)=05h35m14.s5129 and
Dec(J2000)=−05◦22(cid:48)30.(cid:48)(cid:48)576. The total time of observations was 3.5 hours for both days, and total on-source time was
2.5 hours.

Calibration used the pipeline script provided by East-Asian ALMA Regional Center (EA-ARC) through the CASA
(Common Astronomy Software Applications) package. The absolute ﬂux densities were calibrated using J0423-0120
for the ﬁrst EBs in both days. The measured ﬂux densities of the polarization calibrator, J0522-3627, in the ﬁrst
EBs were used as a reference ﬂux for the second EBs. The measured ﬂux densities of J0522-3627 were 4.96 Jy and
5.34 Jy at the ﬁrst and second epochs, respectively. These values were diﬀerent by 5% from the cataloged value of
5.18±0.31 Jy and 5.63±0.20 Jy probably because of its variability, but are within the ﬂux accuracy of ALMA band
3. The bandpass calibration was made using J0423-0120. Residual phase calibration was made using the secondary
calibrator J0541-0211. Another compact radio source J0539-0356 was included as a check source to verify the quality
of calibration.

The polarization calibrations were done by observing J0522-3627 in a standard manner, which showed fractional
polarization of 2.8% (those of Q and U are -1.5% and -2.4%, respectively). According to the ALMA Proposer’s
Guide2, the expected minimum detectable degree of linear polarization is 1% and 3% for compact and extended
sources, respectively.

We note that circular polarization measurements were not assured in these ALMA cycle 5 observations. However,
given the high circular polarization fraction in the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line, we will discuss possible detection of the
circular polarization as described below. Here we summarize results of circular polarization measurements of calibrators
in our ALMA data. For the polarization calibrator J0522-3627, we could not see any signature of the Stokes V leakage
in the full polarization images. On the other hand, there exists possible Stokes V leakage in the images of the
bandpass/ﬂux calibrator J0423-0120 and the phase calibrator J0541-0211. These Stokes V images show point-like
components coincide with the Stokes I emission. The ﬂux densities of the Stokes I and V images of J0423-0120 are

Hirota et al.

1.31 Jy and -3 mJy, respectively, with an rms noise level of the Stokes V image of 0.02 mJy beam−1. Thus, the Stokes
V/I ratio is 0.2%. For J0541-0211, the Stokes V/I ratio is 0.09% with Stokes I and V ﬂux densities of 380 mJy and
0.3 mJy, respectively, and an rms noise level of the Stokes V image of 0.03 mJy beam−1. We could see no Stokes V
emission peak in the check source J0539-0356 probably due to the low Stokes I intensity of 11 mJy with the the Stokes
V/I ratio of <1% (rms noise level of 0.01 mJy beam−1). It should be noted that the calibrators are point sources at
the center of the beam and the leakage may be higher oﬀ-axis. The more recent ALMA Cycle 7 Proposer’s Guide3
indicates that the minimum detectable degree of circular polarization is generally 1.8% of the peak ﬂux within 1/10 of
the primary beam, but can be a factor of 2 higher under unfavorable circumstances. Although the emission region of
SrcI (∼2(cid:48)(cid:48)) is smaller than 1/10 of the primary beam size of 70(cid:48)(cid:48), the accuracy in the extended SiO circular polarization
emission could have higher uncertainties.

Using the resultant calibrated visibility data, synthesis images were made using CASA and Miriad software. We
did not apply self-calibration to the ALMA data because it provided no signiﬁcant improvement (e.g.
in case of a
strong 28SiO v=1 J=2-1 maser feature, the ﬂux density increased only ∼4% ). For the continuum emission we used
only line-free channels to make mfs (multi-frequency synthesis) images. Full-Stokes velocity channel maps were ﬁrst
made with the common velocity resolution of 0.5 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 and v=1 transitions and 1.0 km s−1 for the
other lines. In addition, channel maps with the coarser resolution of 2 km s−1 were also made for display purposes
(see Appendix B). The synthesized beam size was 49 mas×47 mas with a position angle of -35 degrees for the 96 GHz
continuum image. In the case of spectral lines, typical beam sizes are slightly larger, ∼55 mas with an almost circular
beam shape. The brightness temperature, TB, can be obtained from the ﬂux density, F , by TB(K)=6.7×104F (Jy)
with the observed frequency at 86 GHz and the beam size of 50 mas. The shortest baseline length of 41 m provides a
maximum recoverable scale of ∼1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) at band 3.

Because linear polarization intensity is calculated by P = (cid:112)Q2 + U 2, it is biased by the noise in the Stokes Q
and U images. Therefore, the linearly polarized intensity images were debiased by subtracting the rms noise over the
emission-free channels/regions in the images; P = (cid:112)Q2 + U 2 − σ2. Line-averaged polarization angles were calculated
from Stokes Q and U images with velocity widths of 30 km s−1 centered at the systemic velocity of 5 km s−1. This is
because averaging polarization angles over all channels can lead to wrong values owing to the ±180 degree ambiguity
in the angles (e.g., an average of 0◦ and 180◦ should be close to 0◦ or 180◦ but simple averaging yields ∼ 90◦). Finally,
fractional linear polarizations were calculated from the 30 km s−1-resolution P and Stokes I images.

2.2. VLA

Observations with VLA were made on 2018 March 6 with the most extended A-conﬁguration in the full-polarization
observing mode. The number of antennas was 27 and the baseline lengths ranged from 800 m to 36.6 km. The
observed frequency was Q-band (43 GHz) and the target lines are listed in Table 1. We included higher vibrationally
excitation lines of 28SiO at v=1, 2, 3, and 4, but the v=3 and v=4 lines were not detected unlike the higher rotational
level (Kim et al. 2019). For these spectral lines, we assigned 7 spectral windows with 16 MHz bandwidth and 50 kHz
resolution. In addition, we assigned 16 wideband spectral windows with 128 MHz bandwidth to observe continuum
emission. The tracking center position of SrcI is the same as the ALMA observations. The observations lasted 5 hours
to cover a suﬃciently wide range of parallactic angle. The net on-source time was 2.5 hours. We also had another
observing session on 2018 June 9. However, we did not include these data because of the lack of a common amplitude
and polarization calibrator, 3C286, which could introduce unexpected calibration uncertainties.

The data were initially calibrated by the pipeline script provided by NRAO, but only for Stokes I of continuum
emission. Thus, we conducted polarization calibration for both continuum and spectral line data using the CASA
package. The absolute ﬂux density and bandpass were calibrated using 3C286 for which we assumed a ﬂux density
of 1.53 Jy at 43.60 GHz. Phases were calibrated by observing the secondary calibrator J0541-0541. The polarization
leakage and polarization angle were calibrated by observing 3C84 and 3C286, respectively. A fractional polarization of
13.2% and polarization angle of 36 degrees were employed for 3C286 at the frequency of 43.50 GHz (Perley & Butler
2013).

The accuracy of the circular polarization calibration is estimated to be 0.2% from the leakage of Stokes V with
respect to the Stokes I for the polarization calibrator 3C286 and the secondary calibrator J0541-0541, assuming that
they have no circular polarization. We note that there is a signiﬁcant systematic error showing a pair of positive and

Magnetic Field in SrcI

negative circularly polarized components in the calibrator images at a level of 0.2% of the Stokes I, probably due to
the beam squint of the VLA antennas. Nevertheless, we measure SiO circular polarization levels much higher than
the above values without any sign of such a systematic pattern, so we expect these errors to have no signiﬁcant eﬀect
on our analysis.

The calibrated visibility data were used to make synthesis images in the same manner employed for the ALMA
data. Self-calibration was made using a single channel of the strong and compact 28SiO v=1 J=1-0 maser line. As a
result, the observed ﬂux density of the continuum emission increased by 20%. The resultant synthesized beam size was
53 mas×44 mas with a position angle of 30 degrees for the 43 GHz continuum emission. The spectral line maps have
a similar beam size with slightly diﬀerent position angles. Flux density can be converted to brightness temperature
using the equation TB(K)=2.7×105F (Jy) with the observed frequency at 43 GHz and a beam size of 50 mas. The
shortest baseline length in the VLA A-conﬁguration, 800 m, provides a maximum recoverable scale of ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48) at Q-band.

3. RESULTS

We observed in total 13 SiO J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions as listed in Table 1. All were detected except the two
highest excitation lines, 28SiO v=3 J=1-0 and v=4 J=1-0. As listed in Table 1, most of the observed SiO lines are
dominated by maser emission, as their peak brightness temperatures exceed 103 K except for the 29SiO v=1 J=2-1
line. In particular, peak brightness temperatures are extremely high (> 106 K) for the masers in the 28SiO v=0,1,2
J=1-0, v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 lines.

We detected linearly polarized emission in 6 lines: 28SiO v=0,1,2 J=1-0, 28SiO v=0,1 J=2-1, and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0.
All of them show brightness temperatures at the peak channels of >104 K and high linear polarization fraction of a
few % to 90% at maximum. Spectra, moment maps, and channel maps for all the SiO transitions that we detected
(Table 1) are shown in Appendices A and B. These maps show linear polarization intensities and angles with 2 km s−1
velocity resolution, adequate to see most of the individual maser features. In this paper, we will focus mostly on the
ordered polarization structures in the bipolar outﬂow lobes seen in the v=0 masers. Discussion of the vibrationally
excited masers will be presented in forthcoming papers.

3.1. Continuum

Figure 1 shows images of the continuum emission from SrcI at 43 GHz and 96 GHz generated from the wideband
spectral windows, superposed on the moment maps of 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines, respectively. Note that the
28SiO v=0 J=1-0 maps are plotted with a smaller box than the J=2-1 maps because the J=1-0 emission region is
smaller.

The continuum emission traces a nearly edge-on circumstellar disk (e.g. Reid et al. 2007; Goddi et al. 2011b;
Plambeck et al. 2013; Plambeck & Wright 2016; Hirota et al. 2016b; Ginsburg et al. 2018, 2019). Positions, sizes, peak
brightnesses, and ﬂux densities derived from Gaussian ﬁts to these images are summarized in Table 2. The integrated
ﬂux densities of SrcI at 43 GHz and 96 GHz, 10 mJy and 58 mJy, respectively, are consistent with the previous results
(e.g. Goddi et al. 2011b; Ginsburg et al. 2018). The brightness temperatures at the peak positions are 740 K and
770 K for 43 GHz and 96 GHz, respectively. Extended dust emission from the Orion Hot Core is almost completely
resolved out by our interferometric observations.

We did not detect polarization in the continuum emission, with 5σ upper limits of 0.07 mJy beam−1 at 43 GHz and
0.06 mJy beam−1 at 96 GHz. These values correspond to fractional polarizations of <3% and <0.4% at 43 GHz and
96 GHz, respectively. Because the expected minimum detectable degree of polarization with ALMA is 1% and 3% for
compact and extended sources, as mentioned above, the actual upper limit of the 96 GHz continuum is 1%. The low
polarization fraction of the continuum emission in SrcI is expected, since it is thought to be dominated by optically
thick dust at frequencies of 43 GHz and higher (Plambeck & Wright 2016). Furthermore, the gas densities on the disk
surface are estimated to be of order 108-1011 cm−3 in order to pump the vibrationally excited SiO masers (Goddi et
al. 2009a). Similar density values are also suggested by the continuum emission of SrcI (Plambeck & Wright 2016;
Hirota et al. 2016b). At such high densities, collisions are likely to randomize the dust grain orientations, leading to
unpolarized emission.

3.2. 28SiO v=0 lines
3.2.1. Velocity structure
Integrated intensity images of the 28SiO v=0 lines are shown in Figure 1. The velocity range is determined based on
spectra (see Figure A1) in Appendix A. The lines show bipolar structure along the NE-SW direction perpendicular to

6

Hirota et al.

the edge-on continuum disk. The J=1-0 emission is less extended than J=2-1. Bright emission lobes are distributed
away from the disk midplane by ∼0.2(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼80 au). Both the NE and SW lobes are extended to 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) and 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) from
the disk midplane in the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, respectively. These lobes can be traced farther from the disk in lower
resolution maps (Chandler & De Pree 1995; Plambeck et al. 2009; Goddi et al. 2009a; Greenhill et al. 2013). The NE
lobe appears closer to SrcI in both J=1-0 and J=2-1. This may be the eﬀect of foreground opacity in the 28SiO v=0
lines and the inclination of the outﬂow axis, with the NE lobe tilted toward the observer.

The moment 0 maps show compact peaks, probably maser clumps, that are spatially unresolved even at 0.05(cid:48)(cid:48)
angular resolution. The J=1-0 line map has more clumpy structures than the J=2-1 line in spite of comparable
spatial resolutions. This result suggests that maser emission is more dominant in the J=1-0 line than the J=2-1
line. In 0.5 km s−1 channel maps the maximum brightness temperatures of the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines are 2×106 K
(6.6 Jy beam−1 at -5 km s−1) and 5×104 K (0.95 Jy beam−1 at 16 km s−1), respectively, clearly suggesting maser
action.

The radial velocities of the 28SiO lines seen in the moment 1 maps do not show systematic structures such as spatially
symmetric blue- and red-shifted lobes or velocity gradients along the outﬂow axis. However, there is weaker collimated
emission in the integrated intensity maps of the blue- and red-shifted components of the J=2-1 line as shown in
Figure 2, where one can see a velocity gradient along the northwest-southeast direction. The column emanates from
the continuum source, and the direction of the velocity gradient is parallel to that of the rotating disk as traced by
thermal molecular lines (Hirota et al. 2014; Plambeck & Wright 2016; Hirota et al. 2017; Ginsburg et al. 2018, 2019)
and vibrationally excited 28SiO masers (Kim et al. 2008; Matthews et al. 2010; Issaoun et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2019).
The length of the rotating column is almost comparable to the rotating outﬂow traced by the 484 GHz Si18O J=12-11
line (Hirota et al. 2017) as shown in Figure 2. Thus, the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line also traces the rotation of the outﬂow
driven by the disk wind as revealed by the Si18O line.

3.2.2. Linear polarization

Figure 3 shows the spectra of the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 lines integrated across the emission region.
In these spectra, the fractional linear polarization of the J=1-0 line approaches 100%, in particular at the −6 km s−1
component. The high fractional polarization of this feature is consistent with previous single-dish measurements made
with the NRO 45 m telescope (Tsuboi et al. 1996).

Figure 4 shows the moment 0 maps of the linear polarization intensities of the v=0 J=1-0 and v=0 J=2-1 lines of
28SiO. Again, the velocity range of the map is deﬁned based on spectra (see Figure A1 in Appendix A). The rotating
column shown in Figure 2 is not signiﬁcantly polarized and so does not appear in these images. Polarized emission
appears abruptly where the column expands into the extended lobes. We note that the rms noise level of the moment
0 map of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line is higher than that of the J=1-0 line (Figure 1) while the linear polarization
intensity map of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line shows lower rms noise level than that of the J=1-0 line (Figure 4). This
is because the extended thermal emission component is more dominant in the Stokes I of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line
than that of the J=1-0 line, which produces the stronger sidelobe and hence, the higher rms level. In contrast, the
polarization intensity map of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line is free from such extended thermal emission. Thus, possible
eﬀects of sidelobes would be reduced, similar to both the Stokes I and polarization intensity maps of the 28SiO v=0
J=1-0 line.

On average, the fractional linear polarizations of the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 lines are ∼50-70% and ∼20-50%,
respectively. The maximum fractional linear polarizations in individual channel maps (Appendix B) are as high as
90% and 80% for the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines, respectively. We caution, however, that fractional linear polarizations
derived from our aperture synthesis images may be overestimated if unpolarized thermal emission originates from a
larger region than the polarized maser spots. Because of the lack of short baselines in the high resolution VLA and
ALMA conﬁgurations, a greater fraction of the thermal emission will then be resolved out by observations.

Theoretical models (Watson 2009; P´erez-S´anchez & Vlemmings 2013; Lankhaar, & Vlemmings 2019) predict that the
fractional linear polarization of the v=0 SiO masers should decrease as the rotational quantum number (the angular
momentum), J, increases. Our observational results are consistent with this prediction.

Figure 5 plots the velocity-averaged linear polarization vectors, color coded to show polarization angle, with lengths
proportional to the linearly polarized intensities. The linear polarization distributions are averaged over the velocity
interval from −10 km s−1 to 20 km s−1. We used a ﬁxed velocity range for these averaged (single-channel) polarization
angle/ratio images to compare the same velocity ranges for both J=1-0 and 2-1 lines. These ranges are slightly

Magnetic Field in SrcI

narrower than those used for moment maps (Figures 1 and 4). To optimize the comparison of the J=1-0 and J=2-1
transitions, both images were convolved to 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution. This attenuates small scale structures sampled by the
longest uv-spacings and more clearly reveals the overall polarization structure. The error in the polarization angle PA
can be calculated by ∆(PA) = ∆P/2P in unit of radian where P and ∆P are the linear polarization intensity and its
rms noise level, respectively. For the polarization vector maps in Figure 5, we plot the vectors with the signal-to-noise
ratio of 4 or higher, and hence, the errors in the polarization angle, ∆(PA) are smaller than 7 degrees.

One can see systematic polarization patterns in both J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines but the overall trends diﬀer. For the
J=1-0 transition, the NE and SW lobes show diﬀerent direction of the linear polarization. The averaged polarization
angles in the NE lobe are ∼30-120 degrees (from light blue to magenta); polarization vectors more distant from the
outﬂow axis are aligned with this axis while those in the central part of the lobe are rotated by ∼45 degrees from
the axis. In the SW lobe, on the other hand, the averaged polarization angle ranges from 30 degrees in the south to
170 degrees in the north (from light blue to yellow), gradually changing from parallel to perpendicular with respect to
the polarization in the NE lobe. The mean polarization angle and its standard deviation are 81 degrees and 18 degrees,
respectively, in the NE lobe, and 119 degrees and 34 degrees, respectively, in the SW lobe.

In contrast, the J=2-1 transition shows a more ordered pattern of the polarization angles of 60-110 degrees and
50-130 degrees in the NE and SW lobes, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of polarization angles are
76 degrees and 7 degrees, respectively, in the NE lobe, and 81 degrees and 14 degrees, respectively, in the SW lobe.
In the central part of the NE lobe just south of the outﬂow axis, the polarization angles are oﬀset by ∼45 degrees
from those of the other parts, which are almost parallel to the outﬂow axis; this property is in good agreement with
the v=0 J=1-0 line. In the SW lobe, there is a gradual change in the polarization angles toward the northern edge of
the lobe where the vectors are inclined by ∼45 degrees from those of the outﬂow axis, similar to the center of the NE
lobe. Except for these zones, the mean and standard deviation of the polarization angles in both NE and SW lobe are
very similar.

The 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution J=2-1 linear polarization image presented in Figure 5 is consistent with the 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) polarization
image of the same transition obtained with the BIMA array in 2001 (Plambeck et al. 2003, Figure 6a). The Stokes I
and linearly polarized intensities of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 transition that we observed for this line (Figure 3) also are
comparable to those obtained with BIMA (Plambeck et al. 2003, Figure 5).

3.2.3. Circular polarization
Figures 6 shows the Stokes V maps integrated from -10 to 20 km s−1. Boxes in these ﬁgures indicate the positions
of maser peaks for which Stokes I, linearly polarized intensity, and Stokes V spectra are plotted in Figure 7. The
circular polarization varies rapidly as a function of velocity and position. Typical fractional circular polarizations at
the brightest spectral features are 10-40% for the J=1-0 transition and 1-10% for the J=2-1 transition. While ALMA
did not guarantee the accuracy of circular polarization calibration in Cycle 5 (ALMA Proposer’s Guide9), the observed
magnitude of Stokes V is so large that it seems unlikely to be explained only by an instrumental eﬀect.

Although the recent model calculations by Lankhaar, & Vlemmings (2019) predicted the highest circular polarization
is associated with high linear polarization, the highest fractional circular polarizations do not necessarily coincide with
the strongest maser peaks or with the positions of the highest fractional linear polarization (see Figure 6 and channel
maps in Appendix B).

3.3. 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line
Figure 3 also shows the spectrum of the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line. We note that the fractional linear polarization
of this line is much lower than that of the 28SiO line. The peak brightness temperature of 1.3×106 K at the LSR
velocity of −1 km s−1 indicates strong maser emission, as ﬁrst suggested by Baudry et al. (1998). Figure 8 shows
the moment maps and polarization vector maps for this transition. The 29SiO emission region has a size of <0.5(cid:48)(cid:48),
signiﬁcantly smaller than those of the 28SiO v=0 lines. As shown in Figure 8, there is a clear velocity gradient in the
northwest-southeast direction along the disk midplane due to rotation. The polarization vectors integrated over all
the velocity components are nearly parallel with the midplane of the continuum disk toward its eastern and western
margins, but suggest a radial distribution in the northern and southern regions. The polarization structure is more
clearly seen by plotting the blue- and redshifted components separately, as in Figure 9. More detailed structures are
seen in the channel map in Appendix B. We could not detect signiﬁcant circular polarization of the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1
line. The Stokes V map with 30 km s−1-resolution shows peaks coincident with the Stokes I peaks at levels of 0.2-0.6%
of the Stokes I intensities. These levels are consistent with the expected instrumental residuals.

4. DISCUSSION

In this section, we discuss our analysis of the data in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld structure traced by the polarized

SiO maser emissions.

4.1. Physical conditions for polarized masers

Theories of maser polarization (Goldreich et al. 1973; Watson 2009; P´erez-S´anchez & Vlemmings 2013; Lankhaar,
& Vlemmings 2019) predict that the maser radiation will be polarized parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld
direction in the plane of the sky as long as gΩ/2π (cid:29) R, where gΩ/2π is the Zeeman splitting in unit of Hertz, and R
is the stimulated emission rate per second, given by (Goldsmith 1972)

R = BJ+1,J U =

(1)

Here BJ+1,J is the Einstein B-coeﬃcient for the J + 1 → J transition, U is the radiation energy density, µ is the dipole
moment, TB is the brightness temperature, λ is the wavelength, and dΩb is the beaming angle of the maser transition.
There is no way of measuring the beaming angle dΩb; probably it is in the range 0.01-1 steradian. One may, however,
obtain a conservative upper limit for R by assuming dΩb = 4π steradians (isotropic radiation). Using this upper limit,
Plambeck et al. (2003) veriﬁed that gΩ/2π > R for BIMA observations of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 masers (λ=0.35 cm),
assuming a magnetic ﬁeld strength of B = 1 milli-Gauss (mG), gΩ/2π = 0.2 Hz for 1 mG, µ = 3.1 Debye (Raymonda
et al. 1970), and TB=2000 K.

We estimated the stimulated emission rate R for the polarized masers listed in Table 1 using the same parameters
employed by Plambeck et al. (2003), but with revised brightness temperatures given by the new higher resolution data.
Equation (1) can be expressed as

and

(3)

The magnitude of the Zeeman splitting, gΩ/2πB = −230 Hz G−1, can be derived from the relationship µN gBm =
(cid:126)gΩm/2, where g is the Land´e g-factor of the SiO line, −0.15 (?), µN is the nuclear magneton, and m is the quantum
number of the magnetic substate. The condition gΩ/2π > R is satisﬁed with the magnetic ﬁeld strengths of B >13 mG
(28SiO v=0 J=1-0), 1.5 mG (28SiO v=0 J=2-1), and 40 mG (29SiO v=0 J=2-1) for the maximum brightness tempera-
tures of the Stokes I as summarized in Table 1. It is unlikely that the brightest maser spots are radiating isotropically,
however, so the inequality probably is satisﬁed for magnetic ﬁeld strengths (cid:38) 1 mG.

For larger stimulated emission rates, R (cid:38) gΩ/2π, the maser polarization no longer is guaranteed to be parallel or
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld (Nedoluha & Watson 1990; Lankhaar, & Vlemmings 2019). Thus, the v=1 and
v=2 masers, which are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude brighter than the v=0 masers, may not be good probes of the
magnetic ﬁeld direction. Plambeck et al. (2003) found that the polarization position angles of the SiO v=1 J=2-1
masers near SrcI were time variable, hence considered them an unreliable tracer of the magnetic ﬁeld morphology.
However, these 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution observations did not resolve individual maser spots, so it is possible that the position
angle changes were caused by variations in the relative brightness of individual masers within the synthesized beam.
In this paper we consider only the v=0 maser polarizations, which are likely to satisfy the more stringent gΩ/2π > R
condition.

The net decay rates of the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 masers are determined by either the collisional excita-
tion/deexcitation rate, n(H2)Rij or the spontaneous emission rate, Aij, where n(H2), Rij, and Aij are the hydrogen
molecule density, collisional rate coeﬃcient, and Einstein A-coeﬃcient, respectively. Radiative transfer calculations
for the J=1-0 28SiO masers by Goddi et al. (2009a) suggest that the v=0 transition is inverted at densities n(H2)<107
cm−3. The masers are quenched when the collision rate becomes comparable to the stimulated emission rate. This
should set a ﬁrm upper limit on gas density, and hence, we adopt a density of 106 cm−3 in the 28SiO v=0 emission
region. From the plots in Palov et al. (2006), we estimate that the total collisional rates from the v=0 J=1 and J=2
levels into all other rotational levels are of order 10−9 cm3 s−1, which gives a collisional loss rate Γ of order 10−3 s−1.
The Einstein-A coeﬃcients, 3.0×10−6 s−1 and 2.9×10−5 s−1 for the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, respectively

Magnetic Field in SrcI

(Barton et al. 2013), are smaller than the collisional rate, and hence, the dominant source of the decay rate is the

signiﬁcantly smaller than R, so the masers are in the saturated regime.

4.2. 28SiO v=0 lines

We detected high linear polarization in both the J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions which provides us with the data to
map the polarization distribution across the extended lobes of the 28SiO outﬂow from SrcI. The observed fractional
linear polarizations of ∼50-70% and ∼20-50% (Figure 4) are not easily explained unless the masers are anisotropically
pumped (Watson 2009). Nevertheless, as long as gΩ/2π > R the overall pattern of the polarization vector maps is
expected to be parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, and hence, useful as a probe of the ﬁeld direction.

4.2.1. Comparison with previous polarization measurements

The polarized emission of the 43 GHz v=0 J=1-0 masers was ﬁrst detected by Tsuboi et al. (1996) with the NRO
45 m radio telescope at a spatial resolution of 40(cid:48)(cid:48). Figure 2 of Tsuboi et al. (1996) shows a series of spectra at polarizer
position angles of 0-157 degrees. The peak at -7 km s−1 is strongest for a polarizer position angle of 67.5 degrees,
and almost disappears at 157.5 degrees as noted in Tsuboi et al. (1996). However, the position angles shown in their
Figure 4 are mostly in the range 140-180 degrees. The polarization angles in our integrated spectrum (Figure 3) are
∼90 degrees, consistent with their Figure 2, and not with Figure 4. This is because Tsuboi et al. (1996) did not use a
conventional deﬁnition of the polarization angle consistently (Tsuboi, M., private communication).

4.2.2. Faraday rotation

Figure 5 shows that the polarization angles of both the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines vary smoothly across the
source, but are rotated with respect to each other in some regions. As already discussed, the error in the polarization
angle is proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio of the linear polarization intensity, ∆(PA) = ∆P/2P , and is smaller
than 7 degrees for vectors plotted in Figure 5. It allows us to discuss systematic linear polarization structures for
both lines. The diﬀerence in the J=1-0 and J=2-1 position angles is plotted in Figure 10. The diﬀerences are slightly
increasing toward the northwestern and southeastern sides of the NE lobe and the southwestern edge of the SW lobe.
It is possible that the two SiO transitions originate in diﬀerent volumes of gas with diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld orien-
tations. In Figure 3, the polarization angle of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line shows a smooth proﬁle, while that of J=1-0
shows a big jump from ∼90 degrees to ∼170 degrees around 5 km s−1. The J=1-0 line also shows highly scattered
polarization angles from 10 to 20 km s−1, which is much larger than the observed uncertainty of ∼3 degrees for the
integrated spectra (i.e. signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10).

Such a diﬀerence would be caused by a stronger maser emission in the J=1-0 line as seen in the diﬀerent spatial
structures between J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines; the former line maps dominate compact/clumpy structures compared with
those of latter ones. In particular, maser lines are sensitive to the physical conditions and geometry of the emission
regions which may result in striking diﬀerence in the spatial distributions and hence, the proﬁles of the integrated
spectra. Nevertheless, similarity in the polarization angles in the NE lobe averaged over the entire velocity range of
emission strongly supports the scenario that both J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines trace overall outﬂow structures in the same
volume of gas.

If both the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines originate from the same volume of gas, the diﬀerent polarization structures could be
explained by the propagation eﬀects. Here, we consider the possibility that Faraday rotation causes the position angle
discrepancies. Faraday rotation occurs when linearly polarized radiation travels through ionized gas with a magnetic
ﬁeld component along the line of sight. The plane of polarization is rotated by

θ(λ) = λ2 RM,

where θ is rotation of the polarization angle in radians and λ is wevelength in meters. The rotation measure RM is

Hirota et al.

Here ne is the electron density in cm−3 and B(cid:107) is the component of the magnetic ﬁeld along the line-of-sight in mG.
For the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 lines with wavelengths of 0.71 cm and 0.35 cm, respectively, a polarization angle
diﬀerence of 1 degree corresponds to RM of 460 rad m−2.

The maximum position angle diﬀerence of ∼60 degrees in the SW lobe corresponds to a rotation measure of
3×104 rad m−2. On the other hand, the NE lobe shows smaller and mostly negative diﬀerences ranging from ∼ −20 de-
grees to 10 degrees. The corresponding RM is from −1 × 104 rad m−2 to 5 × 103 rad m−2. The result suggests that
there could be Faraday rotation within the outﬂow and/or in the foreground ﬁeld.

To explain an apparent 60 degrees systematic diﬀerence in the position angles of the J=2-1 and J=1-0 transitions
seen in older BIMA and NRO data, Plambeck et al. (2003) estimated an RM of 3.3 × 104 rad m−2, and suggested that
the Faraday rotation originated in the foreground Hii region. As noted in section 4.2.1, however, the J=1-0 position
angles derived from our new VLA observations diﬀer substantially from the previously published NRO results, so it is
no longer necessary to account for such a large position angle discrepancy. It also seems unlikely that the foreground
Hii region has a magnetic ﬁeld reversal that coincides precisely with the small gap between the NE and SW outﬂow
lobes.

While the foreground Hii region may contribute to a smooth component of the Faraday rotation, the more plausible
explanation for the structure in Faraday rotation is that it originates from ionized gas associated with the outﬂow,
possibly from a radio jet that is marginally seen in the continuum map of SrcI (Reid et al. 2007) or from molecular gas
that is partially ionized by shocks. If the radio jet is responsible for the Faraday rotation, the ionization rate would be
higher close to the outﬂow axis, whereas the observed RM is higher toward the edges of the SiO outﬂow lobes. Thus,
the latter interpretation is more likely.

If we assume that Faraday rotation occurs in a layer that is 1000 AU with a magnetic ﬁeld strength of 10 mG, then
the electron density in this layer would need to be 100 cm−3 in order to introduce a polarization angle diﬀerence of
10 degrees between the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines. If the total gas density is 106 cm−3, as discussed in the previous section,
this would correspond to a fractional ionization of 10−4. The estimated electron density and fractional ionization are
much higher than chemical model calculations for the shocked molecular gas (e.g. ne ∼ 10−3 cm−3; Caselli et al.
1997). A deeper column of ambient gas may be responsible for the jump in the J=1-0 polarization angle around
5 km s−1.

If we assume that Faraday rotation is responsible for the diﬀerence in the J=1-0 and 2-1 position angles, then we
can solve for the rotation measure at each position where both lines are detected, and compute the intrinsic 28SiO v=0
polarization angles. These are presented in Figure 11. The polarization vectors in the SW lobe are almost parallel to
the outﬂow axis while those in the NE lobe still are signiﬁcantly inclined to this axis, by as much as 45 degrees in the
eastern side. Note that the rotation corrections for the J=2-1 line are typically only 5 to 10 degrees and 20 degrees
at maximum in the SW lobe, so in directions where the J=1-0 line is not detected it is reasonable to assume that the
intrinsic angles are equal to the uncorrected the J=2-1 angles.

We rule out the possibility of much larger Faraday rotations that could produce the 1-0 and 2-1 position angle
agreement by chance (e.g., ∼45◦ at 86 GHz and ∼4×45◦ = 180◦ at 43 GHz) because these would require much higher
electron column densities and/or magnetic ﬁelds. Rao et al. (1998) also estimated an upper limit on the RM toward
the Orion Hot Core of 3×104 rad m−2 based on the close agreement of dust polarization vectors at 3.3 and 1.3 mm
wavelength. Finally, the well ordered 29SiO v=0 polarization vector map with radial pattern close to the disk as
discussed later (Figures 8 and 9) also suggests small rotations at 86 GHz.

4.2.3. Foreground absorption or scattering?

In principle, diﬀerential absorption by foreground magnetically aligned dust grains could rotate the observed maser
polarizations, but we expect this to be unimportant because dust opacities at 43 and 86 GHz are small. For masers in
the ground vibrational state, absorption or scattering by SiO molecules in cold foreground gas is a bigger concern. If
these molecules are in a magnetic ﬁeld, their absorption coeﬃcients are likely to be polarization-sensitive. Then, if the
foreground magnetic ﬁeld direction is twisted relative to the ﬁeld in the outﬂow, the polarization of maser radiation
propagating through this gas could be rotated.

The high circular polarizations observed for the v=0 masers suggest that anisotropic resonant scattering (ARS;
Houde et al. 2013; Houde 2014; Chamma et al. 2018) by foreground SiO could be signiﬁcant, as discussed further
in section 4.2.5. Simple absorption will be important only if the collisional rate is comparable to or larger than the
stimulated emission rate R, so that absorbed photons can be lost through collisional deexcitation. Otherwise, a photon

Magnetic Field in SrcI

11

that is absorbed will quickly be reemitted in the same polarization state. The values we computed for R in section 4.1
were orders of magnitude larger than the collisional rates, but these were upper limits that assumed isotropic maser
radiation. If the masers are highly beamed, R will be substantially smaller. For example, if the solid angle of the
radiation is 0.01 steradians, R ≤ 10−3 sec−1, comparable to the collisional rate.

If foreground absorption or scattering is signiﬁcant, we expect to ﬁnd greater discrepancies between the J=1-0 and
2-1 position angles at blueshifted velocities (VLSR < 5 km s−1), since absorption by foreground gas against the SrcI
continuum is much more prominent at these velocities (Plambeck & Wright 2016). We searched unsuccessfully for such
a correlation. In addition, we found no obvious correlations with the projected distance to the SrcI disk midplane, or
with the oﬀset from the axis of the outﬂow, or with the fractional circular polarization. This, along with the generally
good agreement of the J=1-0 and 2-1 position angles across most of the outﬂow, suggests that foreground eﬀects do
not signiﬁcantly skew the measured polarization directions.

4.2.4. Estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
The large number of polarization vectors measured across the outﬂow lobes in the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line makes
it feasible to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld strength using the Davis-Chandresekhar-Fermi (DCF) method (Davis 1951;
Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953). Normally the DCF method is applied to dust polarization observations. The DCF
method assumes that turbulent motions result in small-scale ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld lines, depending on the
ﬁeld strength. The ﬂuctuation of the magnetic ﬁeld can be measured through that of the linear polarization direction
of the dust continuum emission.

If the same assumptions as used for the dust polarization are valid, we can apply the DCF method to the polarized
SiO maser (e.g. Lee et al. 2018). The outﬂow in SrcI becomes turbulent once it emerges from the rotating column
near SrcI (e.g. Figure 2). It is also clear from the channel maps (see FIgures B2 and B21 in Appendix B) that the
velocity ﬁeld in the lobes is pretty turbulent and not simple rotation. In this case, the large scale polarization structure
could probe the overall magnetic ﬁeld structure in the outﬂow lobes while the smaller scale ﬂuctuation could reﬂect
turbulence due to the interaction between the outﬂow and ambient gas in the extended lobes. Thus, we apply the
DCF method to the polarization structure of the SiO lines in the SrcI outﬂow.

Following the formulation in Crutcher et al. (2004), the plane of sky component of the magnetic ﬁeld is given by

where ρ is the gas density, δV is the velocity dispersion along the line of sight, and δφ is the dispersion in the
polarization position angles. The factor of 0.5 is the correction factor derived from numerical simulations by Ostriker
et al. (2001). On the right hand side, ∆V = (8 ln2)1/2 δV is the FWHM linewidth in units of km s−1, n(H2) is the
molecular hydrogen density in cm−3, and δφdeg is the polarization angle dispersion in degrees.

Examination of the channel maps in Figures B4 and B23 in Appendix B shows that the polarization position angles
are consistent from channel to channel, so we compute the polarization angle dispersion from a channel-averaged image.
The dispersion of the polarization angle (without any correction for Faraday rotation) is 9.5 degrees. The polarization
angle variations are attributable in part to the large scale ﬁeld geometry, which should be removed before using the
DCF formula. Houde et al. (2009, 2011, 2016) have developed a formalism to remove the large scale structure using
a 2-point correlation function; see Chuss et al. (2019) for an example. Here, however, we adopt the simpler strategy
used by Pattle et al. (2017) in which a smoothed position angle map is subtracted from the high resolution map before
the dispersion is calculated.

Accordingly, we convolved the SiO Stokes I, Q, and U images with an 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) FWHM Gaussian, generated a low
resolution polarization angle map from these data, then subtracted this image from the 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution image on a
pixel-by-pixel basis. The result is shown in Figure 12, and a histogram of the residual polarization angle values is
shown in Figure 13. Although the dispersion computed for all the data is 6.1 degrees, this is biased by outliers which
most likely are due to incomplete removal of the large scale structure. In addition, the position angle uncertainty due
to noise can be as large as ∆(PA) = σ/(2(cid:112)U 2 + Q2) ∼ 6◦ with our choice of a 5σ minimum cutoﬀ in Q and U.
Therefore, we adopt a somewhat smaller dispersion δφ = 4◦, as illustrated by the red curve in Figure 13. If we analyze
the data of the NE and SW lobes separately (see Figure 13), we obtain the standard deviation of the polarization
angle residuals of 4.8 degrees and 7.4 degrees, respectively. Obviously, the ﬁeld estimates for the two lobes separately
will diﬀer by only about 50%, and hence, we will employ the result for all the data.

Hirota et al.

The velocity width of the 28SiO line is attributable to large scale outﬂow motions and rotation as well as turbulence,
but the Stokes I images in Figures B2 and B21 in Appendix B suggest that these systematic motions make only
a modest contribution to the 28SiO linewidths. Therefore, we adopt an FWHM linewidth ∆V ∼ 10 km s−1. The
hydrogen density within the lobes is the ﬁnal parameter needed to estimate the ﬁeld strength. As discussed above,
we adopt a density of 106 cm−3 in the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 emission region in order to satisfy the maser pumping model
(Goddi et al. 2009a).

Inserting these estimates into equation (6) gives a plane of sky magnetic ﬁeld strength of 23 mG. An estimate for
the total ﬁeld strength is 4Blos/π (Crutcher et al. 2004), or ∼30 mG. Assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld strength scales
as the square root of the gas density, e.g. B ∝ n0.49 (Vlemmings 2007) and B ∝ n0.65 (Crutcher 2012), a magnetic
ﬁeld strength ∼30 mG is consistent with that estimated from OH maser observations (Cohen et al. 2006) in a density
n(H2)∼ 107 cm−3, and with an estimate of 300 mG for the v=1 SiO masers close to SrcI (Matthews et al. 2010)
where density n(H2)∼ 109 cm−3. We note that the above scaling laws come from density regimes of gravitationally
contracting cores where the magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be well coupled with the gas. Although the derived ﬁeld
strength from the SiO data agrees with these relationships, they may not apply to the ﬁeld in the outﬂow.

A magnetic ﬁeld of order 30 mG could explain why the bipolar outﬂow from SrcI is not swept back into two trailing
arms by the ram pressure of the ambient molecular cloud as SrcI plows through the cloud at ∼ 12 km s−1. The
magnetic pressure associated with a 30 mG ﬁeld is B2/8π ∼ 4 × 10−5 dynes cm−2, much larger than the ram pressure
ρv2 ∼ 4 × 10−6 dynes cm−2, assuming a molecular hydrogen density of 106 cm−3 in the ambient gas. The magnetic
energy density balances the rotational energy density at 18 km s−1 and density 106 cm−3. It oﬀers support for the
idea that sub-Keplerian rotation could account for underestimates of the central mass calculated from rotation curves
of spectral lines close to the launching region of the outﬂow (e.g. Kim et al. 2008; Matthews et al. 2010; Plambeck
& Wright 2016; Hirota et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2019). Possibly the H2O line used as a probe of the velocity ﬁeld by
Ginsburg et al. (2018) is conﬁned more closely to the disk surface, and so is not confused by the outﬂow that has
magnetic support.

4.2.5. Circular Polarization
As shown in Figure 6, Stokes V components are clearly detected in the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0. For the spectra presented
in Figure 7, the fractional circular polarization is as high as 60% for the J=1-0 line. These values are much higher
than the calibration uncertainties as discussed in Section 2.2, and hence, we rule out the possibility that the circular
polarization is an instrumental eﬀect. In spite of the calibration uncertainties, the circular polarization signatures are
also detected in the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line.

A pair of positive and negative components in the Stokes V spectra could be attributed to the Zeeman eﬀect, which
shifts the frequency of the observed spectra with opposite signs of circular polarization as reported for the HI line
(Troland & Heiles 1982) and later for the SiO masers (Barvainis et al. 1987; Vlemmings et al. 2017; Shinnaga et al.
2017). Then the circularly polarized line proﬁles can be ﬁtted by

V = b

dI
dν

,

(7)

where b = zB cos θ is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength along the line of sight, B cos θ and z is the Zeeman
splitting coeﬃcient, gΩ/2π. Here we can ignore the leakage from the Stokes I because it is much smaller than the
Stokes V components in our data.

Assuming uniform magnetic ﬁeld strengths for all the velocity components, we were able to ﬁt some of the velocity
components in the Stokes V spectra to the Zeeman pattern as expressed by equation (7). The magnitude of the
Zeeman splitting, gΩ/2π=230 Hz G−1, corresponds to 1.6 m s−1 G−1 and 0.8 m s−1 G−1 at 43 GHz (J=1-0) and
86 GHz (J=2-1), respectively.

We present the ﬁtting results for the selected two positions showing the most clear signatures of possible Zeeman
splitting pattern. Our ﬁts give b=0.05 and b = −0.16 for the J=1-0 line as shown in Figure 14. These values would
suggest magnetic ﬁeld strengths of 5-16 G. If the Zeeman pattern of the J=2-1 lines is also real, similar magnitudes
of the ﬁeld strengths of 8-10 G (b=0.04 and 0.05) would be inferred. Elitzur (1998) predicts that maser ampliﬁcation
tends to enhance the fractional circular polarization relative to the case of the thermal Zeeman eﬀect. This could lead
to overestimates of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude.

Such large magnetic ﬁelds are implausible. A 10 G ﬁeld corresponds to a magnetic pressure B2/8π = 4 dynes cm−2,
6 orders of magnitude greater than the turbulent pressure ρ ∆V2/3 that one obtains assuming a molecular hydrogen

Magnetic Field in SrcI

13

number density n ∼ 106 cm−3 and a turbulent linewidth ∆V ∼ 10 km s−1. The inferred ﬁelds also are 2-3 orders of
magnitude greater than ﬁelds estimated with the DCF method.

The Zeeman interpretation also is improbable if the opposite signs of the splittings in the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines at the
same positions are real. For example, although the J=1-0 and J=2-1 spectra for Peak 1 shown in the left panels of
Figure 14 both appear to show a clear Zeeman pattern, the magnetic ﬁelds inferred from the two lines have opposite
signs. Similar discrepancies can be seen in the Stokes V maps and spectra (Figures 6 and 14).

We conclude that Zeeman splitting cannot explain the observed circular polarizations. Although the calibrations
of Stokes V in the ALMA data are highly uncertain, the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 lines could give additional support for
our conclusions that the Zeeman interpretation is improbable. Further more accurate measurements of the Zeeman
splittings in the v=0 J=2-1 masers would help interpretation.

It is likely, instead, that the Stokes V spectra arise from a conversion of linear to circular polarization. This can
occur if the linearly polarized radiation propagates through foreground gas with a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld direction4.
Numerical simulations of this eﬀect for v=1 SiO masers in a turbulent velocity ﬁeld by Wiebe & Watson (1998)
produced fractional circular polarizations of up to ∼10% for magnetic ﬁeld strengths of ∼10 mG. Another possible
mechanism producing circular polarization is a gradient of the velocity and/or magnetic ﬁeld along the maser path
(Elitzur 1992).

More recently, an alternative model of ARS was proposed to explain high degree of circular polarization detected in
masers and thermal lines (Houde et al. 2013; Houde 2014; Chamma et al. 2018). ARS occurs when linearly polarized
radiation from molecules in the background scatters oﬀ a population of these molecules in the foreground where the
magnetic ﬁeld direction is diﬀerent. Again, the eﬀect is to convert some of the linearly polarized background radiation
to circular polarization. Houde (2014) notes that a complete conversion of linear to circular polarization is possible.
Thus, ARS is likely for the v=0 SiO transitions toward Orion because there appears to be a large column density of
foreground SiO in the cooler outer regions of the outﬂow. This is indicated by the absence of 28SiO v=0 emission
along the plane of the disk suggesting foreground absorption, and by blueshifted absorption in many other molecular
lines (Plambeck & Wright 2016).
If the ARS is responsible for producing circular polarization up to 20-60%, it
should become the dominant mechanism to rotate the linear polarization angles by redistributing the ratio between
the Stokes Q and U. However, we found no correlation between the fractional circular polarization and the position
angle discrepancies between the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, as stated in the last paragraph of Section 4.2.3. It is unlikely
that ARS would rotate the polarizations of the two transitions by the same amount. Thus, we expect the eﬀects of
ARS on the rotation of the linear polarization angles is small, or limited to small spatial scales and/or velocity ranges
around the regions of strong circular polarization.

4.2.6. Does the SrcI outﬂow impact the Hot Core?
SrcI is oﬀset just 1(cid:48)(cid:48) from the famous Orion Hot Core, a dense clump with many molecular lines (e.g. Wright &
Plambeck 2017; Wright et al. 2020). The relationship between SrcI and the Hot Core is still uncertain; is their proximity
merely a chance projection eﬀect or are they physically/dynamically linked? Observational evidence suggests that the
Hot Core is heated externally, perhaps by shock waves generated by SrcI’s outﬂow (Goddi et al. 2011a; Zapata et
al. 2011b), but there does not seem to be a clear chemical signature of this interaction at the boundary between the
outﬂow and Hot Core. It is also proposed that the explosive outﬂow in this region is the alternative candidate heating
source of the Hot Core (Zapata et al. 2011b), although neither of these two possibilities could be ruled out.

Another method to investigate the relationship between SrcI and the Hot Core is to study how the magnetic ﬁeld of
the outﬂow connects with that in the Hot Core gas, as measured by dust polarization. Toward Orion-KL, 4(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution
polarization observations made with BIMA at 90 and 230 GHz revealed an abrupt kink in the polarization direction
just SE of SrcI (Rao et al. 1998). More sensitive 1(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution observations with the SMA at 345 GHz (Tang et
al. 2010), shown in the left panel of Figure 15, indicate that this kink is part of a smooth, symmetric twist of the
polarization vectors within the Hot Core.

In the right panel of Figure 15, we overlay our SiO J=2-1 polarization vectors on the highest resolution image from
Tang et al. (2010). As discussed above, the polarization vectors of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line should be good tracers of
the magnetic ﬁeld direction near SrcI, albeit with a 90 degree ambiguity. The dust polarization is remarkably strong

4 Nedoluha & Watson (1994) also consider the case of intensity dependent circular polarization that occurs when the stimulated emission
rate R becomes comparable with the Zeeman splitting gΩ/2π. A change of magnetic ﬁeld direction is not needed. Since we estimate that
R (cid:28) gΩ/2π for the v=0 masers, we do not consider this case here.

Hirota et al.

and smooth, and not aligned with the SrcI outﬂow, suggesting a pre-existing well-organized magnetic ﬁeld direction.
There appears to be no correlation between the magnetic ﬁeld directions inferred from the dust and the SiO (whether
or not the SiO linear polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the ﬁeld). Given that the ﬁeld in the outﬂow is strong,
one would expect to ﬁnd some evidence for a kink in the dust polarization adjacent to the outﬂow, but no kink is
apparent in the existing data. If future observations ﬁnd that there is really no connection between the two, and no
obvious depolarization along the interface, this will suggest that the Hot Core is physically remote from SrcI, despite
their proximity in the plane of the sky. It will also suggest that shocks or MHD waves launched by the outﬂow are
not heating the Hot Core.

4.3. 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line

This transition maps the polarization close to SrcI. Figure 8 shows spatial and velocity structures of Stokes I (moment
0 and 1 maps) of the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line along with its linear polarization intensity and vectors. The polarization
vectors are mostly radial pointing toward SrcI or parallel to the disk midplane.

The 29SiO J=2-1 v=0 line could be a good probe for magnetic ﬁeld structure at the base of the disk wind. As
discussed in Section 4.1, the condition gΩ/2π > R is satisﬁed for the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 maser with the magnetic
ﬁeld strength of 40 mG. If the beaming factor of maser is about 10, R becomes smaller by a factor of 10 and hence,
comparable to the Zeeman frequency for a 4 mG ﬁeld. Given that we ﬁnd a ﬁeld strength of ∼30 mG farther out in
the lobes, it is likely that the 29SiO polarization does trace the ﬁeld direction. We note that the Faraday rotation
could cause uncertainties in the polarization angle of ∼10 degrees, when interpreting the magnetic ﬁeld structure from
the polarization results of the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line. However, if it is caused by the foreground eﬀect, the polarization
angle would show systematic smooth change similar to the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the
symmetric pattern of the polarization vectors is caused by the Faraday rotation coincidentally.

4.4. Three dimensional structure of magnetic ﬁeld

We now consider the question of the three dimensional magnetic ﬁeld morphology in the bipolar outﬂow from SrcI.
Several previous works have used the Goldreich-Kylaﬁs eﬀect (Goldreich, & Kylaﬁs 1981) to study the magnetic ﬁeld
geometries in the outﬂows or jets from low mass stars (Girart et al. 1999; Cortes et al. 2005; Ching et al. 2016; Lee
et al. 2018). As in the simplest cases of maser emission, the polarizations can be parallel or perpendicular to the
projection of the ﬁeld on the plane of the sky. If there is dust polarization along the same, or a very nearby, line
of sight, it is possible to resolve this 90 degree ambiguity by comparing the spectral line polarization with the dust
polarization, which invariably is polarized perpendicular to the ﬁeld direction. Unfortunately, dust emission is almost
completely resolved out in our data, and comparisons with lower resolution dust images, as described in Section 4.2.6,
revealed no obvious correlations between the SiO maser and dust polarization directions.

In the original model of maser polarization developed by Goldreich et al. (1973), the relationship between the
polarization and ﬁeld directions depends only on the angle θ between the ﬁeld and the maser propagation direction,
which is assumed to be very close to the line of sight. When θ < 55 degrees (i.e. van Vleck angle), the polarization
vectors are parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld vectors in the plane of sky; when θ > 55 degrees, then the polarization and
magnetic ﬁeld vectors are perpendicular to each other. However, this simple relationship holds only if the masers are
isotropically pumped. The extremely high fractional polarizations observed for the SiO masers in the SrcI outﬂow
strongly suggest that these masers are anisotropically pumped, in which case the parallel to perpendicular transition
angle varies depending on the excitation direction (e.g. Figures A.10-A.18 in Lankhaar, & Vlemmings 2019, in case
of the SiO v=1 masers). This makes it very diﬃcult to make deﬁnitive statements about the ﬁeld morphology.

According to the polarization images of the v=0 SiO masers, our observations reveal three distinct zones: (1) close
to the disk with radial E-vectors in the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line; (2) the rotating column with well ordered rotation but
without signiﬁcant polarized emission, most evident in the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line; and (3) the outer NE-SW lobes
with ordered linear polarization and substantial circular polarization in both the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 lines. No
signiﬁcant polarization was seen in the rotating column. This may be due to lack of strong polarization component in
thermal emission or depolarization by the tight toroidal ﬁeld. The former case would be more likely because the SiO
v=0 masers are possibly quenched at higher density gas as traced by the Si18O line (Figure 2) and 29SiO v=0 maser
(see Figure 8 Goddi et al. 2009a). Magnetic ﬁeld reconnection may play a role in reconﬁguring the ﬁeld topology
from the rotating column to the more uniform ﬁeld observed in the extended lobes. Zweibel (1989) suggests that
reconnection must play a role because of the short time scale available as the outﬂow expands. Magnetic energy is

Magnetic Field in SrcI

15

injected on small scales, where reconnection occurs, and allows the rotating ﬁeld to conform to the large scale ﬁeld
seen in the extended lobes.

To interpret our observational results, we made simple models to illustrate magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration revealed by
the polarization structures. In this paper, we just consider two simple geometries for both toroidal and poloidal ﬁelds
with disk inclination angles of 79-90 degrees (Wright et al. 2020), as shown in Figure 16. These are circular and helical
geometries for toroidal ﬁelds and parallel and conical geometries for poloidal ﬁelds.

For both toroidal and poloidal ﬁeld conﬁguration, most of the magnetic ﬁeld vectors are close to perpendicular to
the line of sight, and hence, polarization vectors are more likely to be perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld vectors
on the plane of the sky. At ﬁrst glance, there is no model that is relevant to our polarization map of the SiO lines
under the assumption as described above. However, looking at panel (b) of Figure 16, it appears that red (front side)
vectors seem to match the observations for the NE lobe, and blue (back side) vectors match for the SW lobe. If this
interpretation is valid, the SiO line would be optically thin and the emission from the rear side is dominant only in the
SW lobe. These assumptions are still uncertain considering the fact that the optical depths of the SiO masers would
be negative or the saturated masers are optically thick.

The 29SiO polarization vectors close to SrcI appear to be radial or parallel to the disk midplane. These could be
consistent with toroidal or helical magnetic ﬁelds at the base of the outﬂow if the polarization and magnetic ﬁeld
vectors are parallel. A helical ﬁeld could also be consistent with the 28SiO polarizations in the outﬂow lobes if the
polarized emission favors either the front or rear side of the outﬂow lobes. However, a detailed simulation would be
required to fully test these possibilities.

We have carried out full polarization observations of multiple SiO lines in the J=1-0 (43 GHz) and 2-1 (86 GHz)
transitions using VLA Q-band and ALMA band 3, respectively, toward a high-mass protostar candidate Orion Source I
(SrcI) at resolutions of 50 mas. Results of this paper are listed below:

5. SUMMARY

1. In total 11 transitions are detected: 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1, 28SiO v=1 J=1-0 and 2-1, 28SiO v=2 J=1-0 and
2-1, 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1, 29SiO v=1 J=2-1, and 30SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1. Higher vibrationally excited
lines of 28SiO J=1-0 v=3 and v=4 are not detected. Most of the detected transitions have high peak brightness
temperatures indicative of maser emission; some of them (e.g. 28SiO v=0) are a mixture of thermal and maser
emission.

2. Maser emission from the v=0, ground vibrational state transitions of 28SiO J=1-0 and 2-1 are distributed up to
∼1(cid:48)(cid:48) from SrcI, in both the NE and SW lobes of the bipolar outﬂow that emanates from its circumstellar disk.
Distributions of the other lines are more compact with sizes of less than ∼0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), possibly emitted from the base
of the outﬂow.

3. Linearly polarized emission is detected in 6 transitions; 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1, 28SiO v=1 J=1-0 and 2-
1, 28SiO v=2 J=1-0, and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0. The continuum emission from SrcI does not show signiﬁcant
polarization at either 43 GHz or 96 GHz.

4. Moderately strong 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 lines could trace well ordered magnetic ﬁeld structures as suggested
by their polarization structures. The linear polarization fractions are on average ∼50-70% and ∼20-50% for
the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, respectively, while the largest values are up to 80-90%. Such a high fractional linear
polarization can be explained by anisotropic pumping or possibly by masers that are highly saturated.

5. Polarization vectors in the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 2-1 lines are consistent with each other in the NE lobe while
they show oﬀsets as large as ∼60 degrees in the SW lobe. The diﬀerence can be explained by the Faraday
rotation with the rotation measure with an order of 104 rad m−2, or possibly by absorption or scattering by SiO
molecules in foreground gas.

6. The large number of polarization vectors in the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 maser lines allows us to estimate the ﬁeld
strength in the outﬂow lobe to be about 30 mG using the Davis-Chandresekhar-Fermi method. Magnetic support
may then explain why the outﬂow lobes are not swept back by the ram pressure of the surrounding gas as SrcI
moves through the surrounding medium at 12 km s−1. Magnetic support might also lead to sub-Keplerian

16

Hirota et al.

rotation velocities for gas at the base of the outﬂow, possibly explaining discrepancies in SrcI mass estimates
based on molecular line rotation curves.

7. Strong circular polarization up to 60% and 20% is detected for the 28SiO v=1-0 and 2-1 lines, respectively,
although the Stokes V measurements of the ALMA data (J=2-1 line) would contain large uncertainties. The
extremely high circular polarization fractions are most likely due to ARS rather than the Zeeman splitting which
requires extremely strong magnetic ﬁeld strengths of ∼10 G to explain the observed spectra.

8. The polarization vectors are radial pointing toward SrcI or parallel to the disk midplane. The 29SiO v=0 J=2-1

line could be a good probe for magnetic ﬁeld structure at the base of the disk wind.

Figure 1. Moment maps of (a) 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and (b) 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 lines. Moment maps are produced by using the
velocity range from -10 to 20 km s−1 and from -20 to 30 km s−1 for the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, respectively. Note that the 28SiO
v=0 J=1-0 map (left panel) is plotted with a smaller box as it has smaller size of distribution. White contours show moment 0
and color scalesindicate moment 1 of the 28SiO lines. The contour levels are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 times the rms noise
levels of 62 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 182 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 J=2-1. Magenta contours
show continuum emission at 43 GHz (left) and 96 GHz (right), with the contour levels of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 times the
rms noise levels of 0.017 mJy beam−1 and 0.070 mJy beam−1, respectively.

Red contours shows the red-shifted components integrated from 10 to 30 km s−1 with the contour levels of 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64
times the rms noise level of 1.07 mJy beam−1 km s−1. Blue contours shows the blue-shifted components integrated from -20
to 0 km s−1 with the contour levels of 4, 8, 16, and 32 times the rms noise level of 0.83 mJy beam−1 km s−1. Gray scale map
shows the 96 GHz continuum emission with the level of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 times the rms noise level of 0.070 mJy beam−1.
(b) Moment 0 and 1 maps of the Stokes I of Si18O J=12-11 line at 484.056 GHz (Hirota et al. 2017), with the black contour
levels of 2, 4, 8, and 16 times the rms noise level of 0.56 Jy beam−1 km s−1. White contours show the moment 0 image of the
Stokes I of the 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 line, with the contour levels of 2, 4, 8, and 16 times 182 mJy beam−1 km s−1.

Figure 3. Source-averaged spectra of total and linearly polarized ﬂux density (black and red histograms, respectively), and
electric vector position angle (blue squares) for the three SiO v=0 lines discussed in this paper. The ﬂux densities were integrated
over boxes centered on SrcI that covered the emission regions; the box was 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48)×0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) for 29SiO J=2-1, 2(cid:48)(cid:48)×2(cid:48)(cid:48) for 28SiO J=1-0,
and 4(cid:48)(cid:48)×4(cid:48)(cid:48) for 28SiO J=2-1. The linearly polarized ﬂux densities and position angles were obtained from vector averages of
Stokes Q and U. Pixels with Stokes I less than a dynamic range cutoﬀ (0.03 Jy beam−1 for 28SiO J=2-1, 0.05 Jy beam−1
for 29SiO J=2-1, and 0.2 Jy beam−1 for 28SiO J=1-0) were masked before creating the vector averages. In the spectra, the
signal-to-noise ratio of each linear polarization emission is larger than 10 for most of the channels which corresponds to the error
in the polarization angle of less than ∼3 degrees. It can be hardly seen in the plot and hence, the error bar is not shown.

Figure 4. Moment 0 of linear polarization intensity maps (white contour) and channel-averaged linear polarization fraction
(color) maps of (a) 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and (b) 28SiO v=0 J=2-1. Moment maps are produced by using the velocity range
from -10 to 20 km s−1 and from -20 to 30 km s−1 for the J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, respectively. Note that the 28SiO v=0 J=1-
0 map (left panel) is plotted with a smaller box. The contour levels are 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 times the rms noise levels of
136 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 27 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 J=2-1. Magenta contours show the
continuum emission as presented in Figure 1.

-10 to 20 km s−1 superposed on moment 0 of linear polarization intensity. The maps are deconvolved with the 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) circular
beam. Note that the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 map (left panel) is plotted with a smaller box. The contour levels are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
and 128 times the rms noise levels of 108 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and 26 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO
v=0 J=2-1. Color-coded lines show position angle of the polarization vectors as indicated in the vertical bar at the right of the
panel. The length of the polarization vector is proportional to the linear polarization intensity. The error in the polarization
angle is smaller than 7 degrees for the linear polarization intensity higher than 4σ. The blue and red dashed lines indicate the
position angle of the outﬂow axis (51 degrees) and disk midplane (141 degrees), respectively (Plambeck & Wright 2016). Gray
scale maps show continuum emission at 43 GHz (left) and 96 GHz (right).

Figure 6. Stokes V maps of (a) 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 and (b) 28SiO v=0 J=2-1 lines. Note that the 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 map (left
panel) is plotted with a smaller box. Stokes V maps are produced by averaging over the velocity range from -10 to 20 km s−1.
The contour levels are ±4, ±8, ±16, ±32, and ±64 times the rms noise levels of 1.44 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0
J=1-0 and 0.17 mJy beam−1 km s−1 for 28SiO v=0 J=2-1. Magenta and blue solid lines show the positive and negative levels,
respectively. Maser features used to extract spectra in Figure 7 are indicated with boxes. Peak 1; Stokes I and linear polarization

Figure 8. Same as Figures 1 and 5 but for the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line. Moment maps are produced by using the velocity range
from -20 to 30 km s−1. (a) White contours show moment 0 and color indicate moment 1 of the 29SiO v=0 J=2-1 line. The
contour levels are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 times the rms noise levels of 107 mJy beam−1 km s−1. Magenta
contours show the 99 GHz continuum emission at 30 mas resolution (Wright et al. 2020). The contour levels are 4, 8, 16, 32,
64, 128, 256, and 512 times the rms noise levels of 0.011 mJy beam−1. (b) Polarization vector of the 29SiO J=2-1 v=0 line

levels are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 times the rms noise levels of 15.9 mJy beam−1 km s−1. The error in the polarization
angle is smaller than 7 degrees for the linear polarization intensity higher than 4σ. Gray scale shows the 99 GHz continuum

(cyan) lines as shown in Figure 5. All the maps are deconvolved with the 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) circular beam. The velocity range of the map is
from -10 to 20 km s−1. The polarization angle rotation of 1 degree corresponds to RM of 460 rad m−2.
