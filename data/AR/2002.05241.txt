Abstract. Systematic variation of the pre-disruption core electron temperature (Te)
from 1 to 12 keV using an internal transport barrier scenario reveals a dramatic
increase in the production of ‘seed’ runaway electrons (REs), ultimately accessing near-
complete conversion of the pre-disruption current into sub-MeV RE current. Injected
Ar pellets are observed to ablate more intensely and promptly as Te rises. At high
Te, the observed ablation exceeds predictions from published thermal ablation models.
Simultaneously, the thermal quench (TQ) is observed to signiﬁcantly shorten with
increasing Te - a surprising result. While the reason for the shorter TQ is not yet
understood, candidate mechanisms include:
insuﬃciently accurate thermal ablation
models, enhanced ablation driven by the seed RE population, or signiﬁcant parallel
heat transport along stochastic ﬁelds. Kinetic modeling that self-consistently treats the
plasma cooling via radiation, the induced electric ﬁeld, and the formation of the seed
RE is performed. Including the combined eﬀect of the inherent dependence of hot-tail
RE seeding on Te together with the shortened TQ, modeling recovers the progression
towards near-complete conversion of the pre-disruption current to RE current as Te
rises. Measurement of the HXR spectrum during the early current quench (CQ) reveals
a trend of decreasing energy with pre-disruption Te. At the very highest Te (≈ 12 keV),
≈ 100% conversion of the thermal current to runaway current is found. The energy
of this peculiar RE beam is inferred to be sub-MeV as it emits vanishingly few MeV
hard X-rays (HXRs). These measurements demonstrate novel TQ dynamics as Te is
varied and illustrate the limitations of treating the RE seed formation problem without
considering the inter-related dependencies of the pellet ablation, radiative energy loss,
and resultant variations of the TQ duration.
If the observed shortening of the TQ
with increasing Te extends to fusion-grade plasmas, than their propensity to form
large quantities of RE seeds at high Te may be far worse than previously thought.
Positively, the high Te scenario in DIII-D produces REs so prodigiously that it can
serve as a meaningful new platform for demonstrating RE avoidance techniques.

1. Introduction and Motivation

The production of relativistic ‘runaway’ electrons (RE) during a tokamak disruption
is a grave concern for future fusion-grade tokamaks such as ITER [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Central to this concern is the expected large avalanche multiplication factor of any
RE ‘seed’, which scales exponentially with plasma current (IP ) [7, 8] and may
be enhanced by interactions with high-Z impurities [9, 10]. A robust program of
experimentation on existing tokamaks is presently ongoing to tackle this challenge
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

When considering the extrapolation of RE dynamics observed on present devices to
fusion-grade plasmas, a key sensitivity expected from ﬁrst principles is the pre-disruption
electron temperature (Te). To ensure a strong cross-section for D-T fusion, and assuming
equipartition of ion and electron energy, Te is strongly constrained to be ≈ 10 keV or
higher in a fusion-grade plasma [23]. In contrast, owing to various constraints present-
day RE experiments are generally conducted in few-keV Te plasmas or colder (the AUG
tokamak being a notable exception [24]). Despite the strong expected sensitivity of the
RE dynamics on Te, no dedicated experimental study has yet appeared in the literature,
thus motivating this exploratory work.

The strong expected sensitivity to Te arises from the ‘hot-tail’ mechanism [25,
26, 27, 28, 29], illustrated conceptually in Fig. 1. Hot-tail is expected to dominate
fusion-grade plasma RE seed formation [26, 30]. In this mechanism, the pre-disruption
electron distribution contains a ‘tail’ of high energy electrons that experience weaker
collisional coupling to the bulk (due to the decreasing dependence of collisional drag
on the thermal velocity in a plasma). During the rapid bulk cooling of the ‘Thermal
Quench’ (TQ), this tail population can decouple from the bulk if the rate of cooling

− 3
exceeds the collisional equilibration time (∝ T
). Intuitively, the two key parameters
2
e
governing in this mechanism are the pre-disruption Te (which sets the size of the tail)
and the TQ duration (which competes with the tail dissipation time).

Theory of this process was ﬁrst presented in Ref. [26], developed in the limit that the
TQ duration is faster than the collisional equilibration time. This model thus eﬀectively
counts the number of electrons (red region in Fig. 1) expected to be collisionally
decoupled for an input TQ duration, which is pre-deﬁned and not self-consistent with
radiation cooling or transport. Nonetheless, this model is straightforward and commonly
used to evaluate the ‘hot-tail’ seed [26, 11, 31, 30] A more recent model, presented in Ref.

Figure 2. A strong dependence of the conversion of pre-disruption current (IP ) into
RE current (IRE) on pre-disruption Te is observed. Explanation of this eﬀect and its
implications is the goal of this work.

[32], self-consistently calculates the TQ cooling dynamics consistent with the expected
energy loss due to radiation. Both of these models are locally evaluated and contain
no spatial transport eﬀects. Going beyond these analytic models requires sophisticated
3D MHD computation to treat the transport, such as with NIMROD[33, 34], M3D-
C1[35], and JOREK[36, 37]. Self-consistent treatment also formally requires interfacing
the MHD timestep with a kinetic treatment of the non-Maxwellian RE generation and
subsequent back-reaction on the Ampere-Faraday laws to capture possible interactions
with the disruption MHD dynamics itself. Such a fully integrated treatment is outside
of present capability though work is ongoing in this direction [38, 39].

Thus far theoretical studies are generically characterized by an absence of direct
experimental input, in particular regarding the interdependencies of the TQ cooling
dynamic with other related eﬀects such as the pellet ablation and the MHD dynamic.
Providing the necessary input on what happens in experiment as Te is systematically
varied is a key goal of this study. For example: Does the RE seed generation change
with Te? Does the pellet ablation increase enough with Te to aﬀect the cooling rate and
thus the TQ duration? Does the kinetic model of Ref.
[32] recover the experimental
results, and using what approximations?

In this paper, the experimental dynamics of RE seed formation is reported as Te is
systematically varied from 1 to 12 keV. Such high Te is achieved by using an internal
transport barrier scenario, and REs were formed using Ar pellet injection (Ar-PI). As
shown in Fig. 2, a dramatic increase in the RE seed production with Te is observed,
culminating in full conversion of the pre-disruption current into RE current at the highest
Te (resulting in a sub-MeV RE beam). Reference discharges where RE were formed
with Ar massive gas injection (MGI) showed no Te eﬀect in the explored range from
1-4 keV. With Ar-PI, further important TQ dynamics are revealed, namely an intense
enhancement of the injected Ar pellet ablation rate, and a concomitant shortening of the
TQ duration. These eﬀects further support strong RE production as Te is increased.

[32] is conducted. The main experimental trend of strongly increasing
RE production with Te is captured by the kinetic model when the eﬀects of increased
Ar ablation and shortened TQ duration are included. A non-monotonic dependence of
the seed production on Te, predicted by kinetic modeling only when Ar quantity is held
ﬁxed [32], is not observed.

[40] (summarized in Ref.

This work builds on the study of Ref.

[21]), where
the ﬁrst estimate of the RE seed current and its comparison to modeling predictions
was presented in a low Te plasma. A RE seed current measurement was extracted
and found to be over-predicted by the Smith model(Ref. [26]), yet under-predicted by
the Aleynikov and Breizman model (Ref.[32]). Both models exhibited an exponential
sensitivity to input parameters in the Te range studied. This work extends the study

ablation, TQ duration, and RE seed formation processes, with consistent results found
at low Te.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The experimental setup is
described in Sec 2. The method to extract the RE seed current is described in Sec.
3. The observed Ar pellet ablation and thermal quench dynamics are described in
Sec. 4. Kinetic modeling is described and compared to experiment in Sec. 5. Finally,
full conversion dynamics at Te ≈ 12 keV are described in Sec. 6. Discussions and
conclusions are given in Sec. 7. Appendix A presents HXR spectra measured during
the early current quench that show a decreasing RE energy with pre-disruption Te.

2. Experimental Setup

Experiments are conducted in a variant of the conventional RE producing discharge on
DIII-D [40, 41]. The discharge is an inner-wall limited low elongation plasma (see Inset
of Fig. 3[a]), typiﬁed by fairly low density (≈ 1.5 ×1019 m−3) and a varying amount
of electron cyclotron heating (ECH). A cryogenic Ar pellet is injected (Ar-PI) from
the low-ﬁeld side midplane to initiate the fast plasma shutdown and generate the REs
[42, 43]. As shown in Fig. 2 (magenta color), the conventional scenario injects the Ar
pellet at IP = 1.2 MA (t = 1.2 s), and is typiﬁed by 1-2 keV average core temperature
((cid:104)Te(cid:105)) as shown in the magenta data-points in Fig. 2).

In contrast, the high Te scenario utilized for this work uses the same basic actuators
with a diﬀerent timing. The ECH power is applied slightly earlier (0.2 s vs 0.3 s) and
the density feedforward target is reduced by 20%. This sustains a strongly reversed
magnetic shear early in the discharge and allows an internal transport barrier (ITB) to
form [44, 45]. Varying ECH power (here from 0.5 - 2.3 MW) allows (cid:104)Te(cid:105) in the core of
the plasma to be scanned from 2-12 keV inside the ITB. A key diﬀerence is also in the
timing of the Ar pellet injection, which arrives earlier (0.35 s or 0.7 s) to take advantage
of the strong ITB phase. Waiting longer in these conditions results in a penetration of
the ohmic current, a loss of reversed shear, and a loss of the ITB. As a result, IP is
signiﬁcantly lower in this high Te scenario: 0.6 MA for the 0.35 s injection, and 0.8 MA

for the 0.7 s injection. This will have important consequences when converting the RE
beam (‘plateau’) current to the RE seed current, as will be described in Sec. 3. Note
the highest (cid:104)Te(cid:105) discharges produced REs without Ar PI, as will be described in Sec. 6.
Equilibria corresponding to each IP have been reconstructed and are shown in Fig.
3. Reconstructions are done with internal current proﬁle and kinetic pressure constraints
achieved via dedicated discharges with short NBI blips for motional Stark eﬀect (MSE)
and charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CER). As can be seen the low IP case
is found to have rather reversed magnetic shear, though even the conventional 1.2 MA
scenario has not had time to fully relax to a stationary Ohmic current proﬁle with q on-
axis not yet unity. The poloidal ﬂux change from the edge (Fig. 3[c]) is also presented,
which as can be seen peaks on-axis from ≈ 0.8 to 1.8 V-s. This can be compared to
the ITER value of 75 V-s [8]. Clearly, avalanche gain is a much smaller eﬀect in these
discharges as compared to fusion-grade tokamak plasmas, as will be discussed in Sec. 3
Pre-disruption electron temperature (Te) and density (ne) proﬁles for the discharges
studied in this work are shown in Fig. 4. Proﬁles are ﬁt using a combination of data
from the Thomson Scattering, Electron Cyclotron Emission, and CO2 interferometer
diagnostics. As can be seen, the ITB exists only in the inner half of the radius, consistent
with the location of minimum q in Fig. 3(b). A very sharp Te gradient is observed at
mid-radius consistent with ITB formation, and later in Sec. 4.1 the Ar ablation will be
shown to be intense as the pellet enters the ITB. A few proﬁles are highlighted in color
in Fig 4. These discharges, at (cid:104)Te(cid:105) of 1.2, 2.5, 4.6, 7.3, and 12 keV will be highlighted in
later detailed analysis and kinetic modeling. Note (cid:104)Te(cid:105) is the average Te over the central

3. Seed Current Extraction in a Seed Dominated Regime

As this work focuses on the RE seed formation dynamics, the ﬁnal RE beam ‘plateau’
current (IRE) has to be converted into the initial seed RE current prior to avalanche
multiplication. Fortunately, this process is signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed in these experiments
owing to the very low values of IP used. Crudely, the avalanche gain factor is
proportional to exp (IP /(IA ln Λ)) [7], where taking ln Λ = 18, the Alfv´en current IA =
17 kA, and IP = 0.6 MA discharge would be able to provide at most an avalanche gain
factor of exp(2) = 7. To simplify the extraction of the seed current for the remainder of
the study only the IP = 0.6 MA discharges are discussed. This crude analysis will now
be extended using more modern treatments to yield more quantitative estimates of the
avalanche gain, though the main result will remain unchanged: owing to the low initial
IP and large observed IRE, the avalanche eﬀect is small in these discharges and can
be removed without introducing signiﬁcant experimental uncertainty. For this reason,
these plasmas can be thought of as existing in a RE seed dominated regime.

Figure 5 indicates evaluations of the avalanche gain for the various IP scenarios
using a 0-D analysis provided in Eq. 99 of Ref.
[6]. A slight modiﬁcation to the
derivation is made, expanding the eﬀective inductance from µ0R0(cid:96)i/2 to µ0R0((cid:96)i/2 +
ln (8R0/a) − 2). This is done to account for the magnetic energy available from outside
the vacuum vessel which can contribute ﬂux in DIII-D but not ITER due to the
disparate vessel resistive times. This modiﬁcation yields the following expectation for

where major radius R0 = 1.67, minor radius a = 0.6, internal inductance (cid:96)i = 1 (from

(estimated), this gives the result shown in Fig. 5, varying both the initial IP and
the ﬁnal IRE. When initial IP = ﬁnal IRE (full conversion), there can be no avalanche
gain as no ﬂux has been consumed (Gain Factor = 1).

In these experiments, the initial IP and the ﬁnal IRE are measured experimentally,
allowing extraction of an estimate of the avalanche gain factor via Eq. 1. This factor,
ranging from 1 to 5, is applied to the observed ﬁnal IRE to obtain Fig. 6, an experimental
assessment of the seed IRE variation with (cid:104)Te(cid:105). As the gain factor is rather small, the
alternate path of estimating the seed IRE from pellet ablation light as in Ref.
[40] is
not here pursued. A dedicated future study is planned, as the analysis procedure is
very challenging at high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) due to the dramatically diﬀerent pellet dynamics as will
be described in Sec. 4.1. It should also be noted that the enhanced avalanche eﬀect
due to partial screening [9, 10] is not included in these estimates. However, as the eﬀect
becomes stronger with the electric ﬁeld, it may not be a large correction in these low
IP plasmas.

becomes intense and prompt, roughly when the pellet enters the ITB edge.

4. Pellet Ablation and Thermal Quench Dynamics

In this section the dynamics resulting from the variation in (cid:104)Te(cid:105) on the observed Ar pellet
ablation, thermal quench duration, and MHD behavior will be described. Signiﬁcant
variations with (cid:104)Te(cid:105) are observed in Ar pellet ablation and TQ duration, demonstrating
that consideration of the Te eﬀect in isolation of these other dynamics misses key
interactions. No clear variation of the MHD dynamic with (cid:104)Te(cid:105) is found.

4.1. Pellet Dynamics

Fast shutdowns in all discharges with (cid:104)Te(cid:105) ≤ 10 keV are intentionally initiated with the
use of an injected Ar cryogenic pellet. The cylindrical pellet travels at 200 m/s and has
dimensions 3 mm diameter x 3 mm length, and contains 4.9 ×1020 Ar atoms (1.9 Pa
m3 or 14 Torr-L). The 3 mm pellet crosses a ﬁxed point in space in 15 µs, which will
be shown to be shorter than the TQ duration. Measurement of pellet ablation light
(Ar-I @ 696.5 nm) is provided by an absolutely calibrated fast framing camera (18 kfps)
observing the pellet trajectory [46, 40].

Estimation of the pellet trajectory from initial pellet position and velocity alongside
total measured Ar-I emission is shown in Fig. 7. Even from the total ablation light
dramatic diﬀerences from low to high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) are observed. At low Te, the pellet is only
partially ablated by the intial thermal plasma, and survives to produce further ablation
from the RE seeds themselves well after the TQ. This scenario is equivalent to the
detailed study of Ref.
[40], where the post-TQ ablation phase is used to estimate the
RE seed.

At high Te, the pellet ablation light is far more intense and prompt, with nearly
all ablation coincident with the TQ. The intense ablation light appears at a consistent

time with the pellet entering the ITB edge. Clearly, the high Te of the ITB is extremely
eﬀective at ablating the pellet, as might be expected by thermal ablation which scales
like T 5/2

e
Measurement of the calibrated Ar-I ablation light allows determination of the
ablated Ar quantity and with some assumptions its distribution throughout the proﬁle.
The Ar radial proﬁle will be used for kinetic modeling of the RE seed formation in Sec.
5. Figure 8(a) presents the rate of ablated Ar atoms, scaled such that the total ablation
is equal to the pellet inventory. Data only up to 0.25 ms after the TQ is presented, to
remove contributions from any post-TQ RE seed induced ablation. Post-TQ dynamics
are beyond the scope of this manuscript, though they are brieﬂy discussed in Appendix
A. Consistent with Fig. 7(b), the Ar quantity is over one order of magnitude higher in
the high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) cases. Application of a published pellet thermal ablation model [47, 48]
using the proﬁles of Fig. 4 under-predicts this ablation rate signiﬁcantly. Application
of a forthcoming pellet thermal ablation model [49] improves on the agreement, ﬁnding
the pellet can only penetrate 0.1 in ρ units but only if the initial (cid:104)Te(cid:105) of 8 keV is used
(ignoring the cooling front and TQ). Any deﬁcit from thermal ablation models indicates
either signiﬁcant ablation from RE seeds or more simply inaccuracies in the thermal

ablation model. Future work is planned to quantitatively compare existing and new
ablation models using this experimental data, and to estimate the RE seed using the
techniques of Ref. [40].

Several ways of estimating the Ar density proﬁle from the Ar ablation are shown
in Fig. 8(b,c). Firstly, the simplest estimate is deposition of the full pellet inventory
uniformly across the plasma. This gives an Ar density (nAr) of 0.29×1020 m−3, as
indicated by the dashed magenta lines in Fig. 8. The second estimate assumes zero
radial transport of the Ar impurity. Here the Ar density is simply the integrated Ar
ablation divided by the area of the plasma annulus in which it is deposited. At high Te
this results in extremely large localized Ar density at the ITB edge and zero inside. The
third estimate assumes a full inward radial spreading. As the ablation is at the ITB
edge, this assumption functionally homogenizes the inside of the ITB for the high (cid:104)Te(cid:105)
cases. The motivation for this is to mimic stochasticity within the ITB region, where
the Ar would spread inwards and the thermal plasma transport outwards. Note in both
assumptions the low Te nAr proﬁle is below the 100% uniform deposition limit - this is
because the pellet is not completely ablated at low (cid:104)Te(cid:105) until signiﬁcantly after the TQ.
The nAr scan range used in later kinetic modeling is also indicated.

4.2. Thermal Quench Dynamics

The impact of the intense pellet ablation on the thermal quench (TQ) dynamics is
now shown to occur simultaneously with a shorter TQ duration and enhanced RE seed
production. Candidate mechanisms to explain the shorter TQ are then discussed. The
main measurement is the ECE radiometer, sampled every 2 µs. Care is taken to only
consider discharges with no evidence of density cutoﬀ.

Discharges at high and low (cid:104)Te(cid:105) are compared in Fig. 9, along with the Ar-I ablation
light. As can be seen the entire TQ dynamic is signiﬁcantly accelerated at high (cid:104)Te(cid:105).
This is striking considering that it should take signiﬁcantly longer to cool a high Te

plasma at constant impurity content. At low Te, a large fraction of the Ar ablation light
is delayed from the main TQ, indicating that only a minority of the pellet inventory
played a role in the TQ dynamics. Further Ar-I light observed after the TQ is due
to additional Ar pellet ablation by the growing RE population. The post-TQ REs are
observed to also drive some ECE after the TQ. At high Te, the entire pellet is ablated
over a very short duration, and the ECE emission almost immediately shows signs of
signiﬁcant non-thermal activity (broadband spikes), which further could in principle
drive further Ar ablation. As discussed in Sec. 4.1, published thermal ablation models
underpredict the pellet ablation [47, 48] though using an upcoming model (ignoring the
cooling front and TQ) improves the agreement [49].

The observed ablation enhancement and shortened TQ observed at high Te is
unexpected. Three mechanisms are now proposed to explain these results. The ﬁrst
explanation is that the observed ablation is purely due to conventional thermal bulk
ablation, and that any mismatch with experiment is simply due to gaps in these models.
Detailed follow-on work is planned to benchmark existing and upcoming ablation models
using this high Te data.

A second mechanism involves the RE seeds themselves playing an important role
in the ablation. A conceptual picture of this event is that a vicious cycle is set up,
whereby increased Ar ablation begets faster cooling (via radiation) which begets more
RE production which begets more Ar ablation, and so on. This mechanism requires
radial transport to repopulate the ﬂux surface with energy and bulk electrons, and also
poloidal transport to quickly distribute the Ar impurity throughout the ﬂux surface.
This picture would be assisted by strong stochasticity within the core plasma, enabling
the aforementioned transport. The net outcome of this mechanism would be a prompt
ablation of the pellet alongside strong RE seed production, which is consistent with
experiment.

A third mechanism is that the enhanced rate of cooling is due to parallel transport
across stochastic ﬁelds as the ITB collapses. The rate of parallel transport scales like
T 7/2
[50], thus all else being equal parallel transport should accelerate the TQ as Te
e
rises. Note that the above mechanisms may co-exist and act together to accelerate the
TQ.

Figure 10 shows a rough estimate of the experimental dependence of the TQ
duration on (cid:104)Te(cid:105). Note extraction of the TQ duration is challenging, with variation
possible across the plasma radius. These values are extracted by inspection of the ECE
measurement, as in Fig. 9, thus some uncertainty is expected. A single aggregate time
is inferred from multiple ECE channels approximating the time to cool from 80 to 20%
of the initial Te, ignoring any slow (pre-TQ) cooling. Despite measurement challenges,
the trend of decreasing TQ duration with (cid:104)Te(cid:105) is clear and robust. Furthermore, kinetic
modeling will be presented in Sec. 5 with the TQ duration scanned as an independent
variable.

It should be noted that while these TQ durations are faster than commonly used
in ITER modeling (0.5 - 1.0 ms [30]), the dominant scaling of the TQ duration is

were found to be below 0.1 ms, also roughly consistent with these DIII-D observations
when scaling by minor radius [51].

Fig. 10 (together with Figs. 2 and 7[b]) should be seen as a key empirical result
of this study. While the experimental actuation was on (cid:104)Te(cid:105) via ECH heating, the
impact of the higher (cid:104)Te(cid:105) indirectly accelerated the TQ duration via either enhanced Ar
ablation/radiation or parallel transport. The combination of high pre-disruption Te and
faster TQ conspires to produce prodigious RE production in experiment, and illustrates
the limitation of taking TQ duration as a constant input parameter.

4.3. MHD Instability Dynamics

Diﬀerences in the MHD dynamics have been previously invoked to explain diﬀerences
in RE seed formation as magnetic conﬁguration is varied, and going from large to small
devices [33, 34]. The dependence of the measured MHD dynamics on (cid:104)Te(cid:105) is shown in
Fig. 11. The n=1 δB poloidal component is extracted from a toroidal array of Mirnov
probes on the low-ﬁeld side midplane on DIII-D [52]. No systematic dependence of the
observed n=1 δB is found, and peak δB is around 40-60 G for all (cid:104)Te(cid:105). Note that at the
measurement location, the toroidal ﬁeld is around 1.6 T, so δB/B is around 3 ×10−3.
While MHD-induced RE losses eﬀects are likely important overall, they appear to
not be changing with (cid:104)Te(cid:105). One caveat is that some instabilities (such as an internal
mode) may not couple strongly to external magnetics, and thus cannot be resolved.
Finally, an IP spike was always observed in these discharges with the exception of the
coldest case (that also had the smallest δB). No trend in IP spike size with (cid:104)Te(cid:105) was

5. Kinetic Model Interpretation

Experimental measurements are interpreted using a recently developed kinetic models
of the RE seed formation process [32]. This model self-consistently treats the cooling
of a bulk Maxwellian electron distribution via impurity radiation, the generation of the
induced electric ﬁeld, and the formation of the RE seed population. This model improves
[26] by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck kinetic equation modelling
over Ref.
the evolution of the hot electron population self-consistently with the power-balance
equation and the equation for the electric ﬁeld. The parallel current density (J||) is kept
constant, and as such the kinetic model treats the TQ but not the CQ. The model is
local (0-D in space), and as such must be independently used at each radial position
in an experimental proﬁle. The main limitation of this model is the absence of radial
transport of any kind, owing to its 0-D formulation. The impurity density is assumed to
be uniform over the ﬂux surface, and the eﬀects of the pellet cloud expansion, discussed
in Ref. [53], are therefore ignored.

Inputs to this model are the local values of Te, ne (Fig. 4) and J|| (Fig. 3) across
the proﬁle for a given discharge, and the Ar density proﬁle (nAr, which sets the TQ
duration in the model).
In its application to understanding these experiments, the
model is independently evaluated across the radius for the experimental proﬁles of the
colored shots in Fig. 4, and nAr is used as the independent variable. Outputs of the

model are the RE seed density (nRE), the RE seed current density (here expressed as a %
of the pre-disruption current density), the TQ duration, and the mean seed RE energy
(ERE). Aggregate metrics such as the total RE seed current can then be obtained by
integrating the radial proﬁle. As a side-note, the kinetic model also allows estimation of
the Dreicer production [54, 55] during the TQ, which is found to be small as the ratio of
the induced electric ﬁeld to the Dreicer ﬁeld stays below around 1 % for all conditions,
as such Dreicer production is ignored in this work. Dreicer was also independently found
to be negligible in the low (cid:104)Te(cid:105) cases studied in Ref. [40].

Example output of the kinetic model for low and high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) discharges is shown in
Fig. 12. The output of the current conversion (Fig. 12[a,c]) and the TQ duration (Fig.
12[b,d]) are displayed across the radial proﬁle and as the Ar density (nAr) is scanned. For
the remainder of this section, diﬀerent estimates for nAr will be used to estimate the RE
seed current and compare to experiment. Several of these nAr estimates are indicated in
Fig. 12: a constant nAr, nAr from experimental Ar-I light (assuming inward spreading),
and nAr from the experimental TQ duration. Since the model self-consistently treats
the radiation cooling from the Ar impurity, the TQ duration is directly related to nAr at
a given radial point. Since the TQ duration is only characterized by a single number in
this study, it can be locally matched across the proﬁle by selecting the appropriate nAr
to yield the desired TQ duration. Simply put, matching the experimental TQ duration

is an alternate means of prescribing an Ar density in the kinetic model.

Figure 13 presents model predictions of the seed RE production across the plasma
radius with several estimates of the Ar density. These are various 1-D cuts of the same
data shown in Fig. 12.

First, the isolated eﬀect of increasing (cid:104)Te(cid:105) at ﬁxed nAr is considered, as shown
in Fig. 13(a-d). At low (cid:104)Te(cid:105), the RE seeds are predicted to be strongest at the edge,
although by examining Fig. 12(c) it can be seen that the radial position of most eﬃcient
RE production depends sensitively on nAr. As (cid:104)Te(cid:105) rises, the seed RE production shifts
to the core and the seed RE current actually drops (Fig. 13[d]), indicating a non-
monotonic behavior with Te as described in Ref. [32]. This eﬀect however is only found
when nAr is kept constant and is not observed in the experiment. As Te further increases,
the seed RE production moves towards occupying more of the plasma radius, and the
seed IRE increases. At the highest Te, RE production is predicted to be in an annular
region at mid-radius, again further evidence of non-monotonicity in Te which relates to
non-monotonicity in the radiative cooling rate of Ar as a function of Te.

Next, similar data is shown in Fig. 13(e-h) for the experimental Te proﬁles (Fig.
4) and experimental nAr (Fig. 8(c)). Note that if the extracted nAr is above the
scan range, a value of 3 ×1020 m−3 is used. As shown in Fig. 12, this is enough
Ar available to convert the entire current to RE current. The predicted seed IRE in this

case monotonically rises with (cid:104)Te(cid:105), as in experiment. The predicted seed RE production
is now also strongest in the core, as opposed to at mid-radius. Unfortunately no existing
diagnostic is available to constrain the radial proﬁle of the seed RE production and is a
key focus of diagnostic development at DIII-D.

As described, a diﬀerent method of using the kinetic model to predict the seed IRE
is to infer nAr from the TQ duration. These two quantities are directly linked in the
model since the cooling is provided entirely by impurity radiation. A TQ duration of
125 µs is enforced across (cid:104)Te(cid:105) and across the radius, giving the predictions shown in Fig.
13(i-l). With ﬁxed TQ duration, the RE seed production now increases with (cid:104)Te(cid:105) and
is again found ﬁrst in the core of the plasma. The experimental TQ duration is used in
Fig. 13(m-p), and since faster TQ duration begets more eﬀective RE production, now
the RE seed rises more rapidly with (cid:104)Te(cid:105), and again begins in the core.

1-D proﬁle results presented in Fig. 13 are summarized in Fig. 14 by extracting
the RE seed current and demonstrating its parametric dependence on the Ar density
(constant across the radius) in Fig.
14(b).
Considering dependence on the Ar density, as Te rises generally the RE seed rises at ﬁxed
nAr except for in a region where a non-monotonic dependence is found. Considering the
experimental data, the Ar density is suﬃciently variant across the radius that little can

be said other than the RE current rises in both experiment and modeling, and at high Te
both model and experiment predict robust RE generation. Considering the TQ duration
as the independent axis (Fig. 14[b]), the non-monotonicity with Te is removed and clear
trends with Te are found in the model. This also illustrates the compounding eﬀect of
the experimentally observed shortening of the TQ with Te. Comparing to experiment,
a quite good agreement is found, with conﬁdence intervals nearly overlapping with the
model prediction curve. This is perhaps expected as the TQ duration provides a rather
strong constraint on the RE generation in the hot-tail mechanism. Interestingly, at the
highest Te, a wide range of TQ durations yield a similarly high RE seed production.

Kinetic modeling of the seed RE current as compared with experimental data using
the various nAr estimates (ﬁxed, Ar-I light, TQ duration) of Fig. 13 are systematically
compared to experimental values in Fig. 15. A clear feature is that at high Te the model
predictions using the diﬀerent estimates converge to a robust RE production, and this
is consistent with experiment. At low Te, model estimates are more varying, with the
Ar-I emission estimate being the most accurate. Over the full Te range, using the ECE
duration is most accurate. A high level conclusion can be made that the experiment
traversed from weak to strong RE production, and the kinetic modeling recovers this
result.

6. Full Conversion Regime

Attention now turns to the highest (cid:104)Te(cid:105) (≈ 12 keV) discharges that produced REs
‘naturally’ without Ar pellet injection. RE production occurred following a prompt
collapse of the ITB together with a signiﬁcant (but unquantiﬁable) inﬂux of carbon from
the DIII-D ﬁrst wall. The highest (cid:104)Te(cid:105) discharge will be shown to exhibit properties
consistent with a prompt conversion of the entire pre-disruption current into REs,

resulting in a low energy (sub-MeV) ﬁnal RE population.

Kinetic modeling using the same framework described in Sec. 5 is applied to the
(cid:104)Te(cid:105) ≈ 12 keV discharge (red proﬁles in Fig. 4). Note that no radial transport eﬀects
are considered in the model. The plasma power balance is still assumed to be governed
by impurity line radiation. The dependence of the seed RE current (IRE) on the carbon
density is shown in Fig. 16, and indicates that at a critical carbon density full conversion
of the pre-disruption current to RE current is observed, analogous to argon in Fig. 14(a).
Fig. 16(b) now considers the average seed RE energy (cid:104)ERE(cid:105), indicating that when full
conversion of a RE beam occurs a sub-MeV seed (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) is expected. Crucially, since the
RE conversion is expected to be complete, there is no ﬂux change to further increase
the RE energy (no current quench). This peculiar RE population would still carry
the current over a cold bulk, but without the MeV-level HXR bremsstrahlung emission
characteristic of normal RE beams. On a longer timescale this population is still slowly
gaining energy and drifting toward the plateau (near-threshold) regime. But unlike in
strongly avalanching cases, (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) never exceeds the attractor energy of the plateau [56].
This regime has previously been observed at low IP in JET [57], though its connection
there to Te is unclear.

Experimentally, evidence for sub-MeV RE beams is indeed found in the behavior
of the RE beam produced at (cid:104)Te(cid:105) of 12 keV. Time-histories are shown in Fig. 17
comparing a low (cid:104)Te(cid:105) discharge (whose shutdown was initiated with an Ar pellet) with
the natural RE producing discharge at 12 keV. The most striking feature of the RE
beam initiated from the 12 keV plasma is the absence of signiﬁcant HXR emission (Fig.
17[e]) while SXR emission is still present (Fig. 17[d]), strongly supporting a low energy
RE beam. Note that the extremely sensitive pulse-height counting Gamma Ray Imager
([58, 59, 60, 61]) does register a very low count rate of HXRs, as even a sub-MeV RE
distribution will have a few REs at MeV levels that can emit HXRs. On DIII-D a RE

beam without signiﬁcant HXR emission is a completely novel observation.

While the conversion to RE current is interpreted to be complete, the IP still drops
after in the high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) shutdown, albeit at a much slower rate. This is interpreted to
be due to a more resistive than usual ﬁnal RE beam, with the maximum available loop
voltage (Vloop) of 10 V being still below the critical electric ﬁeld for this RE beam. As
such, the ﬁnal current decreases to the value that can be sustained by Vloop, which is
about 0.2 MA. This yields a resistance measure of 50 µΩ. Thomson Scattering provides
a measurement of the bulk Te during this phase, ﬁnding (cid:104)Te(cid:105) ≈ 3 eV, and peaking
at 6 eV (as shown in the inset of Fig. 17[c]). The Spitzer resistivity of the bulk is
thus at least an order of magnitude higher than the observed resistivity, conﬁrming
that the current must be carried predominantly by REs. Estimating the resistivity of
the sub-MeV RE beam formally requires knowledge of the carbon fraction (to estimate
the number of bound electrons), which is not known. However, assuming the carbon
density to be 19 ×1019 m−3 (near the minimum to access full conversion), and using
an appropriate partial screening factor for a sub-MeV population (via Eq. 27 in Ref.
[6]), the predicted resistivity of the beam is found by the kinetic model to be 60-70
µΩ, which is consistent with observation. The better than usual match to experimental
resistivity (well predicted collisional dissipation rate) may be due to the absence of
high-energy REs and thus an absence of drift-orbit loss, which was recently invoked to
explain discrepancies in the observed dissipation rates on DIII-D[62].

The ﬁnal interesting feature of the full conversion regime is that no modiﬁcation
of the shape control algorithm is in principle needed to maintain control of the RE
beam, unlike regular RE beams [63]. Since the CQ is nominally avoided the conversion
from thermal to sub-MeV RE current is transparent to the control system. Indeed no
changes were made in the high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) discharge shown in Fig. 17 yet shape control was
maintained.

7. Discussion and Conclusions

This study has identiﬁed several important features of RE production going from low
to high Te, spanning a full reactor-relevant range from 1 to 12 keV. Findings are
summarized as follows:

1) The seed RE production is found to be extremely sensitive to Te, and the
experiment transitions from modest RE production to prodigious RE production at the
highest Te. This is all the more remarkable since the avalanche gain of these plasmas
is very small (as discussed in Sec. 3). The small avalanche gain fortuitously allows the
observed ﬁnal RE current to be translated to the seed RE current while introducing
minimal experimental uncertainty.

2) The RE production is even more sensitive to Te than expected due to indirect
eﬀects that shorten the TQ duration. High Te produces intense pellet ablation that
deposits a much larger quantity of radiators into the plasma, leading to a faster TQ
(assuming the cooling is determined by line radiation). Alternatively, parallel transport
7/2, leading to another mechanism that could also accelerate the TQ. If the
scales like Te
observed shortening of the TQ with increasing Te extends to fusion-grade plasmas, than
their propensity to form large quantities of RE seeds at high Te may be far worse than
previously considered.

3) At the highest Te of near 12 keV, observations support the full conversion of
the pre-disruption current into sub-MeV RE current without signiﬁcant HXR emission.
This RE beam was naturally kept under shape control (without changing any settings),
conﬁrming the control system transparency of full RE conversion and allowing the
possibility of a regular soft-landing for these beams. Indeed, a full RE conversion may
be preferable than a partial conversion so long as the loss of shape control and vertical
instability is avoided.

4) Kinetic modeling robustly reproduces the strong seed RE production at the
highest Te, with several estimates of the poorly constrained Ar density proﬁle all leading
to strong RE production. Overall, the best agreement with experiment is found when
matching the TQ duration, though the measured Ar density assuming radially inward
transport also yields agreement within an order of magnitude.

5) Appendix A shows the RE energy measured in the early CQ decrease with pre-
disruption Te, though the eﬀect cannot be isolated to seed RE dynamics as opposed to
diﬀerences in the CQ. This can be considered a positive by-product of the increased
current conversion to REs.

21

These observations highlight the propensity to form RE beams in high Te plasmas,
which may be even more severe than previously appreciated, and motivates the
development of improved theoretical models to better capture the observed eﬀects.
While overall this work presents a rather troubling set of ﬁndings, a few additional
comments can be drawn.

First, this study was dependent on an ITB scenario to reach high Te. This brings
the question of whether some observations are peculiar to an ITB scenario as opposed
to being generic to any high Te plasma.
It is conceivable that a process intrinsic to
the ITB (namely a MHD-driven fast crash) is responsible for the observed short TQ
durations. It is interesting to note that ITBs were found in JET to have the shortest
TQ durations [51], though they were also among JET’s highest Te plasmas (as they are in
DIII-D). The measurements presented in Sec. 4.3 however ﬁnd no meaningful diﬀerence
in the observed δB at the wall during the TQ. Furthermore, as discussed in Sec. 4.1,
the injected Ar pellet inventory was more than suﬃcient to produce the observed TQ
durations exclusively through radiation cooling, as presented Sec. 5. Another possible
peculiarity of the ITB is the sharp Te gradient, which would promote intense and local
pellet burnup. The sharp Te proﬁle of the ITB scenario however is qualitatively similar
to the predicted ITER pedestal Te proﬁle, which is ≈ 5 keV at the pedestal top [64].
These questions further motivate an integrated treatment of the pellet ablation, RE seed
production, and MHD evolution, which will likely require integrating extended MHD
codes [33, 34, 36, 37] with radiation [35] and kinetic [39] solvers to treat the TQ+RE
dynamics.

Secondly, this work points to the importance of doing experimental seed RE studies
at high Te. While future reactors will require a disruption mitigation solution that is
valid for all Te, high Te plasmas are more relevant to disruptions in a fusion burn
scenario and they are found to yield an entirely diﬀerent dynamic with respect to the
pellet ablation and TQ dynamic. The insights gained comparing low and high Te plasma
dynamics should be invaluable in developing a believable self-consistent simulation of
the RE seed formation process. Varying Te thus oﬀers a fruitful path to validating
predictive models in present-day experiments and extrapolating their results to fusion-
grade plasmas.

Finally, the high Te plasma presents for the ﬁrst time a robust platform on DIII-
D for demonstrating RE avoidance. Previously, small variations (in Te, or in the
pellet integrity) were suﬃcient to prevent RE formation [65, 34], making RE avoidance
demonstrations meaningless in such marginal conditions. In contrast, a demonstration
of RE avoidance via advanced pellet injectors [66, 67] or other techniques [68, 69, 70]
would be more meaningful in the robustly RE producing high (cid:104)Te(cid:105) ITB scenario, though
the strong avalanche multiplication would still be absent.

Appendix A. RE Energy Spectrum During Early CQ

In this Appendix the RE energy measured in the early CQ will be shown to decrease
with pre-disruption Te. Measurements in the early CQ cannot be directly linked to
the RE seed because during the CQ, additional dynamics such as ﬂux conversion,
RE acceleration, and secondary avalanche take place which are not accounted for in
the TQ kinetic modeling of Sec. 5. Measurements are made with a single central
tangentially viewing chord of the Gamma Ray Imager diagnostic [58, 59, 60, 61], used
here functionally as a single HXR spectrometer. HXR spectra can only be measured
once the RE energy exceeds 1 MeV, which requires a fraction of the current quench
(CQ) to have elapsed. With these limitations in mind, a qualitative comparison to
kinetic modeling is nonetheless presented in this Appendix.

Kinetic model predictions of the average seed RE energy ((cid:104)ERE(cid:105)) are presented in
Fig. A1, which uses the same abscissa as Fig. 14(a). As Ar quantity increases the
TQ duration decreases, the RE current conversion increases and (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) decreases. This
is because more REs are available to carry the current, and so the requisite energy
per RE decreases. Furthermore, as (cid:104)Te(cid:105) increases, the predicted (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) decreases as
well, also because more seed REs are available to carry the current. Considering the
radial proﬁle, as shown in Fig. 13, the decreasing (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) can also be understood as an
expanding spatial region of 100% conversion, as these regions have lower ERE.

GRI measurements as (cid:104)Te(cid:105) is varied are shown in Fig. A2, with high and low

(Fig. 14), (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) decreases as more REs are participating in carrying the current.

Figure A2. GRI measurements for low and high Te discharges, with (a) IP , (b)
Ar-I ablation light, (c) GRI raw ﬂux, and (d) HXR spectra accumulated via GRI
pulse-height counting shown.

Figure A3. Systematic variation of maximum HXR energy (Eγ,max) vs (a) pre-
disruption (cid:104)Te(cid:105) and (b) ﬁnal RE current (IRE).

(cid:104)Te(cid:105) cases highlighted. Note the earlier appearance of HXR ﬂux (> 1 MeV) at high
Te, indicating more prompt RE production. Integration windows of 1 ms are used to
produce the HXR spectra shown in Fig. A2(c). As can be seen, the HXR spectrum is
found to shift to lower energy with (cid:104)Te(cid:105), indicating the RE energy decreases with (cid:104)Te(cid:105).
While CQ dynamics are outside the scope of this manuscript, it is worth pointing
out a few interesting features. Firstly, MHz-range Alfv´enic instabilities during the CQ
(described in Ref.
[61]) are only observed at the lowest Te, supporting the hypothesis
that a minimum (cid:104)ERE(cid:105) is required to excite these instabilities. Second, the ﬁnal post-
TQ Te is not constant in the discharges of Fig. A2. For initial Te of 1.2, 2.5, 7.3 keV,
the ﬁnal Te is measured by Thomson scattering to be 3, 5, 2 eV. Understanding the CQ
dynamic of these discharges is left to future study.

The maximum HXR energy (Eγ,max) is plotted against Te and IRE in Fig. A3. The
ﬁrst panel can be thought of as a TQ-dominant interpretation, whereby Eγ,max is set
by the seed (cid:104)ERE(cid:105). The second panel is a CQ-dominant interpretation, whereby the
more RE current the less ﬂux is available to accelerate the seed REs to higher energy.
In reality, it is likely that a combination of both eﬀects is responsible for the decreased
RE energy with (cid:104)Te(cid:105).
