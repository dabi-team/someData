ABSTRACT

We model dust formation in the core collapse supernova explosion SN 1987A by
treating the gas-phase formation of dust grain nuclei as a chemical process. To compute
the synthesis of fourteen species of grains we integrate a non-equilibrium network of
nucleating and related chemical reactions and follow the growth of the nuclei into
grains via accretion and coagulation. The eﬀects of the radioactive 56Co, 57Co, 44Ti,
and 22Na on the thermodynamics and chemistry of the ejecta are taken into account.
The grain temperature, which we allow to diﬀer from the gas temperature, aﬀects
the surface-tension-corrected evaporation rate. We also account for He+, Ne+, Ar+,
and O weathering. We combine our dust synthesis model with a crude prescription
for anisotropic 56Ni dredge-up into the core ejecta, the so-called “nickel bubbles”, to
compute the total dust mass and molecular-species-speciﬁc grain size distribution.
The total mass varies between 0.41 M(cid:12) and 0.73 M(cid:12), depending on the bubble shell
density contrast. In the decreasing order of abundance, the grain species produced
are: magnesia, silicon, forsterite, iron sulﬁde, carbon, silicon dioxide, alumina, and
iron. The combined grain size distribution is a power law dN/da ∝ a−4.39. Early ejecta
compaction by expanding radioactive 56Ni bubbles strongly enhances dust synthesis.
This underscores the need for improved understanding of hydrodynamic transport and
mixing over the entire pre-homologous expansion.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dust grains are important throughout astrophysics. They
absorb ultraviolet (UV) and visible light and radiate in the
infrared (IR). This produces the extinction and reddening
(Mathis 1990) that must be taken into account when infer-
ring the properties of astronomical sources such as the star
formation rates of galaxies (Kennicutt 1998; Calzetti et al.
2000; Dunne et al. 2011). Dust grains are a component of
the interstellar medium (ISM) that is essential to the star
formation process (Draine 2003; McKee & Ostriker 2007;
Draine 2011; Kennicutt & Evans 2012). They shield the in-
teriors of dense molecular clouds from molecule-dissociating
radiation. They act as cooling agents in star-forming gas
clouds and as catalysts for formation of the molecules, such
as H2, that do not form eﬃciently in the gas phase (Cazaux
& Tielens 2002). Grains are also essential in planet forma-
tion (Williams & Cieza 2011). Since grains are composed
of refractory elements such as carbon, oxygen, and silicon,
these elements are depleted from the gas phase. In the dens-
est, coldest molecular gas, volatile compounds such as H2O

and CO2 form icy mantles on refractory grain cores. Radi-
ation pressure on grains can drive winds from cool, evolved
stars and potentially also drive outﬂows in active galactic
nuclei and starbursts.

Given the ubiquity and importance of dust grains in
the cosmos, it is vital that we understand how they are pro-
duced, modiﬁed, and destroyed. In principle, dust grains can
form in any environment where an initially hot, dense gas
expands and cools, as in explosions and outﬂows, or where a
gas cloud is being compressed isothermally to high densities,
as in pre-stellar cores. Decades of research, however, point to
the stellar winds from the cool atmospheres of asymptotic
giant branch and supergiant stars (e.g., Ferrarotti & Gail
2006) and the expanding ejecta of supernovae (e.g., Clayton
et al. 1997; Derdzinski et al. 2017) as the main contributors
of dust. Interstellar dust grains may also form in novae (e.g.,
Mitchell & Evans 1984; Rawlings & Williams 1989), in out-
ﬂows from active galactic nuclei (e.g., Elvis et al. 2002), in
the material ejected in stellar mergers and common envelope
systems (e.g., L¨u et al. 2013), in the colliding winds of Wolf-

Rayet stars (e.g., Crowther 2003), and in extreme mass loss
events in luminous blue variables (e.g., Kochanek 2011). It
is unknown exactly what fraction of dust mass comes from
each of these classes of events. The origin of this uncertainty
seems to be an incomplete theoretical understanding of the
astrophysics of dust formation.

Dust formation can be directly observed in nearby core-
collapse supernovae through the dust’s imprint on supernova
spectra (Sugerman et al. 2006; Fox et al. 2009, 2010; Kotak
et al. 2009; Sakon et al. 2009; Inserra et al. 2011; Meikle
et al. 2011; Szalai et al. 2011; Maeda et al. 2013). As dust
grains condense in supernova ejecta, the spectrum of the
supernova changes in three characteristic ways. The opti-
cal luminosity of the ejecta decreases due to absorption by
grains. The IR luminosity increases as the grains reradiate
the absorbed energy in the IR while the total luminosity of
the ejecta decreases following the progression of radioactive
decay. The peaks of optical emission lines are blueshifted as
optical photons from the far side of the ejecta are more likely
to be absorbed (e.g., Smith et al. 2012).

Due to its proximity, SN 1987A in the Large Magel-
lanic Cloud has been the best studied case of dust forma-
tion in supernovae (e.g., Gehrz & Ney 1987, 1990; Dwek
1988; Kozasa et al. 1989, 1991; Moseley et al. 1989; McCray
1993; Colgan et al. 1994; Ercolano et al. 2007; Van Dyk
2013; Indebetouw et al. 2014; Matsuura et al. 2015; Wesson
et al. 2015). Wesson et al. (2015) used three-dimensional
radiation transfer calculations to simulate the evolution of
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of SN 1987A while
varying the dust mass, grain chemical composition, grain
size distribution, and location of dust in the ejecta. They
are able to reproduce the observed SEDs if: (1) dust mass
increases from 0.001 M(cid:12) at 615 days to 0.8 M(cid:12) at 9200 days
after the explosion, (2) while the dust mass always increases,
most of the dust forms well after 1000 days, (3) the dust is
mostly carbon with some silicates (perhaps 85% carbon and
15% silicates), (4) the grain radius distribution has a loga-
rithmic slope of −3.5 but the typical grain radius increases
from ≈ 0.04 µm at 615 days after the explosion to 3 µm at
9200 days, (5) dust forms in clumps that occupy ∼ 10% of
the volume of the ejecta and have clump radii ∼ 1/30 of
the ejecta radius (so there are ≈ 2700 clumps), and (6) the
clumps expand sub-homologously. Bevan & Barlow (2016)
have conﬁrmed these relatively large dust masses by mod-
eling the observed emission line proﬁles with Monte Carlo
radiation transfer calculations. In contrast, Dwek & Arendt
(2015) infer a sharply diﬀerent, early and rapid dust mass
evolution. By 615 days, the dust mass has already reached
0.45 M(cid:12), with 0.4 M(cid:12) in silicates and 0.05 M(cid:12) in amorphous
carbon, and that over the following two decades, the dust
mass does not increase appreciably. In this work we attempt
to shed light on this apparent disagreement.

There are a few other supernovae that have shown ev-
idence of dust formation, mostly through blueshifted emis-
sion lines (Milisavljevic et al. 2012). However, due to the
large distances, it is typically diﬃcult to observe the sig-
natures of dust formation. Alternatively, one can search
for evidence of dust in supernova remnants in the Milky
Way and its satellite galaxies (e.g., Sandstrom et al. 2009;
Rho et al. 2009). Probably the most studied such object
is Cassiopeia A, the remnant of a supernova at a distance
of ∼ 3.5 kpc that was observed to explode about 300 years

ago (see, e.g., Dunne et al. 2009). Detecting alumina, car-
bon, enstatite, forsterite, magnesium protosilicates, silicon
dioxide, silicon, iron, iron oxide, and iron sulﬁde with the
Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopy, Rho et al. (2008)
showed that 0.02 − 0.054 M(cid:12) of dust has formed in its ejecta.
De Looze et al. (2017) used spatially resolved Herschel and
Spitzer observations of Cas A to infer a cold dust mass of
0.1 M(cid:12) < Mdust < 0.6 M(cid:12) in the unshocked ejecta. Bevan et
al. (2017) used the damocles Monte Carlo radiation trans-
fer code and observations of the blueshifted emission lines
in the spectrum of SN 1980K, SN 1993J, and Cas A to in-
fer a dust mass of 0.12 M(cid:12) < Mdust < 0.3 M(cid:12) in SN 1980K,
0.08 M(cid:12) < Mdust < 0.1 M(cid:12) in SN 1993J, and Mdust ≈ 1.1M(cid:12)
in Cas A. A signiﬁcant dust mass has also been detected in
the Crab nebula (Gomez et al. 2012; Owen & Barlow 2015).
Its IR spectrum can be ﬁtted with a dust size distribution
that is a power law with slope between −3.5 and −4 (Temim
& Dwek 2013).

Supernovae provide unique physical conditions for the
production of dust grains. While the average metal mass
fraction in galaxies is of the order of 1%, supernova ejecta
can be 100% metal. The ejecta is exposed to the γ rays, X-
rays, and nonthermal electrons and positrons produced in
the radioactive decay of 56Co, 57Co, 44Ti, and 22Na. These
nonthermal particles ionize atoms and dissociate molecules
and thus modify the chemistry of the ejecta. For example,
destruction of molecules can liberate metals to become in-
corporated in grains, whereas ionization of noble gas atoms
provides agents for grain weathering.

The grains produced in the ejecta must ultimately sur-
vive destruction in the reverse shock before becoming a part
of the ISM (e.g., Biscaro & Cherchneﬀ 2016; Micelotta et al.
2016). How much of the dust made in a supernova makes it
to the ISM depends strongly on the grain size distribution,
with larger grains in denser clumps more likely to survive the
reverse shock (e.g., Bianchi & Schneider 2007; Nozawa et al.
2007, 2010; Bocchio et al. 2016). After newly formed grains
enter the ISM, they are modiﬁed by shock waves created by
supernovae, by coagulation, by cosmic ray sputtering, and
by accretion of gas phase metals (and volatiles such as H2O
and CO). Grains can also be destroyed if they become in-
corporated in stars.

The dust grains’ eﬀects depend on the chemical com-
position and size. These properties should not be spatially
uniform in the ISM because grains form in some environ-
ments and are modiﬁed in others. For example, extinction
curve variation shows that that grains in dense molecular
cloud cores have diﬀerent properties than those in the dif-
fuse ISM (Chapman et al. 2009). In an attempt to model
the grain properties, theoretical computations of dust grain
formation have been attempted at various levels of physical
realism, each one adding a formidable layer of complexity.
Speciﬁcally, in the 30 years since SN1987A, three signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent approaches to simulating dust formation in
supernovae have emerged.

The simplest approach is the classical nucleation the-
ory (CNT) that treats grain formation as a barrier-crossing
problem in which the free energy of a small cluster of atoms
ﬁrst increases as atoms are added to the cluster. When a
critical cluster size is reached, the free energy then begins
to decrease as further atoms are added. The CNT provides
the rate per unit volume, called the nucleation current, at

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

which critical-size clusters come into existence, as well as
the rate at which the nucleated clusters grow into grains
by accreting gas-phase atoms. To estimate the nucleation
current, the CNT assumes that a steady state has been at-
tained between monomer attachment and detachment. The
CNT ignores the actual chemical reactions participating in
the formation of the cluster. It assumes that clusters have
thermodynamic properties of the bulk material from which
they are made and are subject to surface tension. It ignores
chemical reactions that can destroy grains and ignores grain
growth by coagulation. Thanks to its simplicity, the CNT
has been widely used, for example by Kozasa et al. (1989,
1991) in the modeling of dust grain formation in SN 1987A.
Todini & Ferrara (2001) used the CNT to model dust for-
mation in core collapse supernovae from Population III star
progenitors and Schneider et al. (2004) for dust formation in
pair-instability supernovae (also from Population III stellar
progenitors). Bianchi & Schneider (2007) used it to calculate
the amount of dust produced in a SN 1987A-like explosion.
Recently, Marassi et al. (2015) used it on a grid of progeni-
tor and explosion models to compute the properties of grains
formed in Population III supernovae.

The second method of modeling dust formation in su-
pernovae is kinetic nucleation theory (KNT). In the KNT,
the number densities cn of clusters of n ≥ 2 atoms (called
n-mers) are explicitly tracked. Grains are allowed to grow
by addition of atoms (condensation) and erode by removal
of atoms (evaporation). The condensation rate is computed
from kinetic theory and the evaporation rate by applying the
principle of detailed balance. The KNT is more realistic than
the CNT in that it does not assume a steady state between
condensation and evaporation. However it still ignores the
actual chemical reactions participating in the formation of
the initial seed nucleus of a dust grain. In modeling the evap-
oration rate, it assumes that the grains has thermodynamic
properties of a solid bulk material with surface tension cor-
rection. It ignores chemical reactions contributing to grain
destruction and also ignores grain growth by coagulation.
The elements of this technique can be found in Nozawa et al.
(2003) and Nozawa & Kozasa (2013). Nozawa et al. (2008)
used the KNT to model dust formation in SN 2006jc and
Lazzati & Heger (2016) for the formation of carbon grains
in core-collapse supernova ejecta.

The third approach to modeling dust formation, one
that we will adopt, could be called ‘molecular nucleation
theory’ (MNT). It explicitly tracks the abundance of each
molecular species (such as CO and SiO) with a non-
equilibrium chemical reaction network. Speciﬁcally, it fol-
lows the chemical binding of clusters of monomers such as
C4 or Mg4Si2O8 into larger n-mers that are still treated as
molecular entities. The molecules that have reached a cer-
tain size can then act as grain condensation and coagulation
nuclei. MNT was introduced in Cherchneﬀ & Lilly (2008)
that investigated molecular synthesis in a pair-instability-
type Population III supernova. Cherchneﬀ & Dwek (2009)
included the eﬀects of radioactivity and Cherchneﬀ & Dwek
(2010) further computed the formation of condensation nu-
clei for various types of dust grains in both pair instability
and core collapse supernovae. Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2013)
extended this framework to cluster nucleation in Type II-P
supernovae. These applications of MNT did not treat dust
grain growth, but only the formation of the molecular and

cluster precursors that is the ﬁrst stage of dust grain for-
mation. Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2015) extended MNT to the
grains themselves and began estimating the grain size dis-
tribution and total dust mass yield for various grain types.

The cited studies of dust formation in supernovae as-
sumed that supernova ejecta were either fully mixed (sin-
gle zone models) or spherically symmetric (one-dimensional
models). In one-dimensional models the ejecta are divided
into concentric shells, each characterized by an initial ele-
mental composition and prescribed thermal evolution. The
shells at smaller radial mass coordinates contain heavier el-
ements and expand from higher initial densities and tem-
peratures. Recent realistic three-dimensional simulations of
supernovae, however, suggest that the ejecta are not spher-
ically symmetric (Hammer et al. 2010; Wongwathanarat et
al. 2010). Heavy elements such as 56Ni can be ejected ahead
of lighter elements such as 12C (Wongwathanarat et al. 2013,
2015, 2017). This anisotropy is a consequence of the ampliﬁ-
cation of non-spherical perturbations by the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability (also called Ritchmyer-Meshkov instability in im-
pulsively accelerated ﬂuid). Sources of initial perturbations
are turbulence and convection during the unstable, dynam-
ical inner-shell (e.g., silicon) burning in the progenitor (Ar-
nett & Meakin 2011; Ono et al. 2013; Smith & Arnett 2014;
Couch et al. 2015; M¨uller et al. 2016) as well as neutrino-
induced convection behind the stalled shock wave and the
standing accretion shock instability (e.g., Hanke et al. 2013;
Abdikamalov et al. 2015; Lentz et al. 2015, and references
therein). Perturbations are ampliﬁed into nonlinear ﬁngers
in compositional interfaces where the mean molecular mass
and the density drop sharply outward (e.g., Mao et al. 2015;
Wongwathanarat et al. 2015). The interfaces are unstable
because in the aftermath of the shock crossing, they are
where the acceleration vector (relative a local freely falling
frame) aligns with a strong density gradient, both pointing
inward.

A consequence of the strongly-aspherical explosion ge-
ometry is that blobs of the 56Ni synthesized during α-rich
freezeout of complete explosive silicon burning are ejected
into, and become embedded within, lighter-element mate-
rial. The 56Ni decays into 56Co which then decays into
56Fe. These radioactive decays deposit thermal energy in the
gas. The heating raises the pressure in the blobs above the
pressure in the surrounding ejecta. The overpressured 56Ni-
enriched blobs are termed “bubbles” (e.g., Fryxell et al. 1991;
Herant et al. 1992). The bubbles expand super-homologously
with respect to the rest of the ejecta. The expanding bub-
bles can sweep up thin, high density shells. Once the bubbles
and their shells become optically thin to the γ rays emitted
during radioactive decay, their interior pressure drops and
they resume homologous expansion (Wang 2005). The shell
surrounding a bubble may itself become Rayleigh-Taylor un-
stable and fragment (Basko 1994). Once molecules and dust
grains form in the shell, the shell may cool so rapidly that its
pressure drops below that of the ambient ejecta. In this case,
the shell can enter contraction (in homologously expanding
coordinates).

This basic “bubbly” structure is in fact observed in
young supernova remnants such as the Cas A (Milisavljevic
& Fesen 2015) and also the remnant B0049-73.6 in the Small

Magellanic Cloud (Hendrick et al. 2005).1 Recently, Abel-
l´an et al. (2017) used observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to create three di-
mensional maps of CO and SiO in the inner ejecta of SN
1987A. These maps deﬁnitively show that the distribution
of molecules is not uniform but clumpy in the inner ejecta.
Matsuura et al. (2017) used ALMA observations at high
frequency resolution to detect CO, SiO, SO, and HCO+ in
the ejecta of SN1987A. The distorted proﬁles of the emis-
sion lines from these molecules also imply that they are not
uniformly distributed in the ejecta.

Here we present a model of dust formation in super-
novae constructed within the framework of MNT. We pre-
compute initial data for local temperature and mass den-
sity evolution of the ejecta and for the local nucleosyn-
thetic yields and then follow the formation of molecules
with a fully nonequilibrium chemical reaction network. The
model includes reactions such as: three-body molecular as-
sociation, thermal fragmentation, neutral-neutral and ion-
molecule reactions, radiative association, charge exchange,
recombination with electrons in the gas-phase, and destruc-
tion by energetic electrons produced by the radioactive de-
cay of 56Co, 57Co, 44Na, and 44Ti. The formation of large
molecules that act as condensation nuclei for grains is fol-
lowed as part of this network. The grains grow by accreting
gas-phase molecules and coagulating. The coagulation rate
accounts for the eﬀects of the van der Waals force and also
the Coulomb force due to grain electric charge. Grains lose
mass through evaporation, reaction with noble gas ions, and
oxidation. The grain temperature, which is needed for the
evaporation rate, is allowed to diﬀer from the gas temper-
ature and depend on the grain radius and post-explosion
epoch. The evaporation rate computation includes the ef-
fects of surface tension and the lack of gas-grain thermal
coupling (the latter implying that the thermodynamic ﬂuc-
tuation leading to evaporation must come from within the
grain itself). We consider several representative ejecta ﬂuid
elements, each of which has its own chemical composition
and thermodynamic evolution, and track molecule and grain
formation in each element. Our simulation calculates the
abundance of each species (atoms, molecules, ions, free elec-
trons, and dust condensation nuclei) as a function of time
from the explosion. The calculation provides us with the
properties of dust formed in each representative ﬂuid ele-
ment.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
present our modeling of the radioactive heat and ionization
sources in the ejecta and of the structure and thermal evo-
lution of the ejecta. In Section 3 we describe our chemical
framework and in Section 4 we describe our modeling of
grain growth and destruction processes. In Section 5 we de-
scribe our time integration scheme. In Section 6 we present
the results and in Section 7 we discuss the implications of our
results and delineate desirable next steps. Finally, in Section
8 we summarize our main conclusions. In Tables 1–2 we pro-

supernova ejecta.

2.1 Radioactive decay

Explosive nucleosynthesis produces large quantities of ra-
dioactive nuclei and their decay has profound consequences
for the thermal and chemical evolution of the ejecta. Let
Nn(0) be the total number of atoms of radioactive isotope
n immediately after the explosion. Then at time t after the
explosion, the remaining number of atoms of the radioactive
isotope is Nn(t) = Nn(0)e−λn t , where λn is the decay rate. The
number of decays per unit time is |dNn/dt| = λn Nn(0)e−λn t .
There are four radioactive decay chains that aﬀect the ejecta
during the period that dust grains are forming, between
∼ 100 and ∼ 104 days after the explosion: 56Ni → 56Co →
56Fe, 57Ni → 57Co → 57Fe, 44Ti → 44Sc → 44Ca, and
22Na → 22Ne (e.g., Woosley et al. 1989). The half-life of
56Ni is 6 days, much shorter the the time scale on which
dust forms, so we can assume that it has decayed into 56Co.
Similarly, the half-life of 57Ni is only 36 hours and we can
take that it has decayed into 57Co. The half-life of 44Sc, the
immediate product of 44Ti decay, is only 4 hours; since this
is much shorter than the 60 year half-life of 44Ti, we can as-
sume that 44Ti decays directly into 44Ca. Thus, the eﬀective
radioactive decays included in the simulation are:

56Co → 56Fe,

57Co → 57Fe,

44Ti → 44Ca,

22Na → 22Ne.

Each radioactive decay releases an energy Qn that
is distributed among γ-ray and X-ray photons, electrons,
positrons, and neutrinos. The chain of processes begins when
a parent nucleus decays into an excited state of the daugh-
ter nucleus by electron capture or positron emission. Then,
the excited daughter nucleus decays to its ground state by
emitting γ photons or by transferring energy to bound elec-
trons that are ejected (internal conversion). If bound elec-
trons are removed by electron capture or internal conversion,
then higher energy bound electrons can lose energy and ﬁll
the vacancy. The electronic transitions occur via X-ray emis-
sion or Auger ionization. The γ photons repeatedly Comp-
ton scatter on bound and free electrons, each time losing
some energy and producing a high energy “Compton” elec-
tron. Eventually the γ photon either escapes the ejecta or is
photoelectrically absorbed.

The high energy electrons produced by Compton scat-
tering, photoelectric absorption, internal conversion, Auger
ionization, and secondary ionization lose energy by ionizing
atoms and molecules, dissociating molecules, electronically
exciting atoms and molecules, and undergoing Coulomb col-
lisions with charged particles in the gas, the latter pro-
cess converting the electron’s kinetic energy into heat. The
electrons produced by electron-impact ionization of atoms
and molecules are called secondary electrons and themselves
must lose energy via the above processes. The positrons
emitted during positron emission decays lose energy in the
same way as electrons. After they lose all of their kinetic en-
ergy they bind with electrons into positronium, which decays
into two 511 keV photons. These γ photons lose energy in
the same way as those produced directly in nuclear decays.

We take the initial quantities of the radioactive iso-
topes to be N56(0) = 1.62 × 1054 (0.076 M(cid:12)), N57(0) = 8.77 ×
1052 (4.2 × 10−3 M(cid:12)), N22(0) = 5.5 × 1048 (10−7 M(cid:12)), and
N44(0) = 5.69 × 1051 (2.1 × 10−4 M(cid:12)). These values are from
the computation of explosive nucleosynthesis in SN 1987A
by Thielemann et al. (1990). In particular, our adopted
44Ti mass of ≈ 2 × 10−4 M(cid:12) is just somewhat larger than
the mass 1.5 ± 0.3 × 10−4 M(cid:12) recently inferred directly from
spectroscopy with NuSTAR (Boggs et al. 2015), the lat-
ter consistent with Jerkstrand et al. (2011), and below the
≈ 3 × 10−4 M(cid:12) inferred from spectoscopy with INTEGRAL
(Grebenev et al. 2012). We refer the reader to McCray &
Fransson (2016) for further discussion of the 44Ti mass. For
the optical depth coeﬃcients τn,0 we adopt the estimates
from Li et al. (1993) for SN 1987A: τ56,0 = 13.2, τ57,0 = 31.7,
and τ44,0 = τ22,0 = 16.

that have been ionized by Compton electrons radiatively re-
combine with thermal electrons, and when molecules that
have been dissociated by Compton electrons reform by ra-
diative association. Although we do not include the eﬀect
in our present calculations, this UV radiation is important
for dust synthesis because it heats the dust grains, it in-
ﬂuences the electric charge of dust grains via photoelectric
absorption, and dissociates molecules.

To model the UV radiation, let fUV denote the fraction
of deposited radioactive energy converted into UV radiation;
we set fUV = 0.35, within the range of values found in Kozma
& Fransson (1992). The UV luminosity is then LUV(t) =
fUV L(t) where L(t) is given in Equation (3). If we assume
that a UV photon spends a time ∆t = R/c in the ejecta
before escaping, where R is the radius of the ejecta and c is
the speed of light, then the energy in the UV radiation is
UUV(t) = LUV(t)∆t and the energy density is:
uUV = 3 fUV L

Let nγ(E)dE be the number density of UV photons with
energy between E and E + dE. Ideally, this should be com-
puted with a Monte Carlo simulation that explicitly follows
the degradation of energy deposited from radioactive de-
cay and the subsequent radiative transfer (e.g., Swartz et
al. 1995; Kasen et al. 2006; Jerkstrand et al. 2011). Here,
instead, we crudely approximate nγ(E) such that the total
energy density in the UV radiation equals uUV. We choose
the photon number density per unit energy to be Gaussian:

nγ(E) = Aγ,0e−(E−E0)2/2σ2

energy, and σ0 is the spread. The total energy density is:

In this work we use E0 = 4.431 eV and σ0 = 1 eV, where
these values are motivated by the analysis in Jerkstrand et
al. (2011).

where Niso is the number of radioactive isotopes in the ejecta
(here, Niso = 4 for n = 56Co, 57Co, 44Ti, 22Na). We assume
that some fraction fion of the deposited energy goes into
ionizing atoms and ionizing as well as dissociating molecules;
the rest goes into exciting atoms and molecules and heating
the gas. On the basis of the model of Liu & Dalgarno (1995)
we crudely estimate fion ≈ 0.35 and use this value in all of
our calculations.

2.3 UV radiation

A consequence of radioactive energy deposition is a buildup
of UV radiation that permeates the ejecta. The UV photons
are produced when atoms and molecules excited by Comp-
ton electrons de-excite by spontaneous emission, when atoms

2.4 Progenitor model, ejecta composition, and

kinematics

To calculate the properties of dust that forms in SN 1987A
we need the elemental composition as well as the mass den-
sity and gas temperature as a function of time at each point
in the ejecta. The elemental composition of the ejecta was
determined by simulating the evolution and explosion of a
star with initial mass of MZAMS = 20 M(cid:12) and initial abso-
lute metallicity equal to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud
ZLMC = 0.007 using the stellar evolution code mesa (Pax-
ton et al. 2015). Stellar mass loss rate was parametrized to
reduce the stellar mass to a pre-explosion value of 14.5 M(cid:12),
a target mass chosen to approximate the pre-explosion mass

the mesa code for the 20 M(cid:12) progenitor model of Paxton et al. (2015). Radioactive isotopes with half-lives < 10 yr were replaced into
their stable daughter decay products (see Appendix, Table 12).

of ∼ 14 M(cid:12) inferred from the early observations of SN 1987A
(see McCray & Fransson 2016, and references therein).

The core collapse was simulated by excising the central
1.825 M(cid:12) and placing a reﬂecting hydrodynamic boundary
at that mass coordinate. The explosion was driven by de-
positing 2.3 × 1051 ergs of thermal energy over a mass coor-
dinate range ∆M = 0.05 M(cid:12) adjacent to the excised region
over the course of 1 second. The deposition launched an
outward-propagating shock wave. Explosive nucleosynthe-
sis in the shock-heated ejecta was followed through freeze-
out for 60 seconds when the kinetic energy had dropped to
1.27 × 1051 ergs. The mesa calculation gives isotope-speciﬁc
yields with isotopic half-lives varying over a wide range. For
simplicity, we converted the isotopes with half-lives shorter
than 10 yr into their stable daughter isotopes. The result-
ing isotopes all had half-lives longer than 30 yr. In the dust

synthesis calculation we do not distinguish between iso-
topes; the isotope (unstable and stable) to element conver-
sion scheme is given in Table 12 in the Appendix. In Figure 1
we show elemental mass fraction Xi as a function of the en-
closed mass Mej,1987A.

The model implies the following stratiﬁcation of the pro-
genitor star: the neutron star (M < 1.825 M(cid:12)), the explo-
sively synthesized iron group (1.825 M(cid:12) < M < 1.892 M(cid:12)),
the lighter element ejecta (1.892 M(cid:12) < M < 6.8 M(cid:12)), and the
hydrogen envelope (6.8 M(cid:12) < M < 14.5 M(cid:12)). The mass coor-
dinate extent of 56Ni was set found to be MNi = 0.068 M(cid:12),
a value consistent with the range allowed by observations of
SN 1987A. The boundary between the helium core and the
hydrogen envelope was set where the hydrogen mass fraction
dropped to a negligible value 10−10. The mass of helium and
lighter element “core” ejecta was Mcore ≈ 5 M(cid:12).

tal stratiﬁcation, we take the 56Ni to be “dredged-up” into
discrete clumps that end up randomly distributed in the core
ejecta; we call these clumps “bubbles” (see Section 1). The
radioactive energy released when the 56Ni in the bubbles
decayed into 56Co (and to a lesser extent when the 56Co de-
cayed into 56Fe) over-pressured the bubbles against the sur-
rounding core ejecta and for a period of time, the nickel bub-
bles expanded super-homologously. The super-homologous
expansion stopped when the bubbles became optically thin
to the γ-rays emitted in the radioactive decays. By the start
our dust-synthesis simulations, at 100 days after the explo-
sion, the bubbles have returned to homologous expansion
but occupy an elevated fraction of the volume of the helium
core. We assume that the bubble expansion has swept up
thin shells of the surrounding core ejecta. In Figure 2 we
show a schematic diagram of the geometry of our model.

At the end of super-homologous bubble expansion, the
ejecta had the following structure: low density Ni, Co, and Fe
bubbles with a total mass equal to the Ni mass Mbub = MNi
occupying a fraction fNi of the volume of the helium core,
multiple high density shells of swept up core ejecta with total
mass:

Mshell = ω fbub − MNi/Mcore
ω − Mbub/Mcore

(Mcore − Mbub),

where the density in the bubbles immediately after the ex-
plosion (before super-homologous expansion) was assumed
to be ω times the mean density, and intermediate density
ambient ejecta outside of the bubbles and shells with mass
Mamb = Mcore − Mbub − Mshell.

With these assumptions, the mass density in each of the

three regions evolves under homologous expansion as:

ically correct value of shell thickness could be η ∼ 0.01
(Basko 1994; Wang 2005), because the simulation of such
thin, and therefore dense, shells is computationally expen-
sive, for practical reasons we assume thicker shells η ≈ 0.1
in our ﬁducial simulation, and separately explore the scal-
ing of the results in the limit of thin shells. Using these

in shells and is inconsequential in our model. For the interested
reader, the number of bubbles could be ≈ 75 for a ﬁlling factor of
0.5 based on Figure 4 of Li et al. (1993).

Figure 2. The ﬁgure provides a schematic illustration, not to
scale, of how we model the density structure of the ejecta. We de-
ﬁne three regions, each of uniform density, corresponding to the
low density interiors of nickel bubbles, the high density shells of
the material swept up by the expanding bubbles, and an inter-
mediate density region unaﬀected by the bubbles.

parameters gives Mshell = 2.45 M(cid:12) and Mamb = 2.48 M(cid:12).
Thus outside of the nickel bubbles a fraction fshell = 0.498
of the mass is in shells and famb = 0.502 is in the ambient
ejecta. Evaluating Equation (10) we obtain, for the bub-
ble and ambient densities, ρbub(t0) = 1.1 × 10−14 g cm−3 and
ρamb(t0) = 3.9 × 10−13 g cm−3. The shell densities depend on
the shell thickness parameter. For the shell densities we ob-
tain ρshell,η=0.1(t0) = 1.2 × 10−12 g cm−3 and ρshell,η=0.01(t0) =
1.3 × 10−11 g cm−3.

We perform dust synthesis calculations on a grid of
ejecta mass coordinates. For the bubble ejecta within
1.825 M(cid:12) ≤ M < 1.892 M(cid:12) we lay a grid with spacing
∆M = 0.01 M(cid:12) and run our calculations separately at each
coordinate. The elemental composition in each run is taken
from the mesa calculation whereas the density and tem-
perature are chosen as appropriate for bubble interiors. The
density is as given in Equations (9) and (10) and the temper-
ature we discuss in the following section. The results of these
runs are used to determine the properties of dust formed
in the bubbles. For the shell and ambient ejecta within
1.892 M(cid:12) ≤ M < 6.8 M(cid:12) we choose a set of mass coordinates
separated by ∆M = 0.1 M(cid:12) and run our code twice at each
coordinate. The two runs at the same mass coordinate have
the same composition but diﬀerent densities and tempera-
tures. One run has a temperature and density appropriate
for the shells and the other for the ambient ejecta.

2.5 Thermal evolution

The ejecta thermal evolution is governed by the radioac-
tive energy input.3 After 56Ni and 57Ni have decayed, the
heating is due, in increasing order of the half-life, to 56Co,
57Co, 22Na, and ﬁnally 44Ti. We used the radiation trans-
fer code cloudy (Ferland et al. 2013) to create a model for
the gas temperature evolution. The cloudy calculation is
not designed to accurately capture the geometry of radia-
tive energy input and transfer within the ejecta. Therefore,
it cannot be used to predict the normalization of the tem-
perature, but only its variation in time. We normalize the
temperature evolution by recalibrating a cloudy integra-
tion to astronomical measurements of the temperature. This
approach allows us to extrapolate the temperature evolution
past the ﬁrst 1000 d when measurements of the temperature
are not available. We believe that the temperature evolution
obtained through this heuristic procedure is more realistic
than the power-law models invoked in published computa-
tions of dust synthesis in supernovae. In fact, we ﬁnd that
the ejecta temperature does not decrease in a power-law
fashion.

Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst use cloudy to compute the tem-
perature of an optically-thin singe zone at distance R(t) =
2.16 × 1015 cm(t/100 days) from a point source and receding
from the source with radial velocity v = 2, 500 km s−1. The
zone has atomic number density 8.8 × 109 cm−3(t/100 days)−3
and ﬁducial adopted atomic concentrations in the proportion
C : O : Mg : Al : Si : S : Fe = 0.25 : 0.25 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.1 :
0.1.4 The single zone is irradiated by a source with a lumi-
nosity equal to the rate at which energy is released during
radioactive decay (excepting the portion of the radioactive
energy released in neutrinos). We take the source to emit
photons at 6 discrete energies, 5 of which are produced di-
rectly in the decays and the 6th is an artiﬁcial source of 1
keV photons crudely representing the energy deposited as
X-rays, electrons, and positrons. The photon energies and
luminosities as a function of time for each discrete energy
are given in Table 4 and are plotted in Figure 3. During
the ﬁrst 900 days our computed luminosity agrees with the

3 In SN 1987A, the luminosity by ∼ 2000 days is dominated by the
ejecta’s interaction with the circumstellar medium (e.g., McCray
& Fransson 2016). We do not model this eﬀect.
4 We exclude helium because it does not contribute to cooling.

empirical bolometric luminosity of SN 1987A (Suntzeﬀ &
Bouchet 1990; Bouchet et al. 1991).

We ran the cloudy calculation on a temporal grid with
100 day spacing that spans the post-explosion period from
100 to 104 days. This provides an instantaneous temperature
model Tcloudy(t) at every epoch. The raw thermal evolution
generated this way cannot be taken at face value because it
ignores radiation transfer eﬀects, spatial variation in chem-
ical composition, and spatial variation in density. We recal-
ibrate by uniform rescaling the cloudy model to empirical
estimates of the temperature in SN 1987A. The recalibra-
tion is empirical and heuristic; it is justiﬁed by the close
match between the recalibrated and measured temperature
during the ﬁrst ∼ 1000 days. In particular, the recalibration
can be construed as accounting for all the optical depth ef-
fects and the incompleteness of the inventory of molecular
coolants included in cloudy. The atomic temperature track
is in reasonable agreement with the calculations shown in
Figures 7 and 10 of Fransson & Chevalier (1989) that cover
the thermal evolution from 200 to 950 days.

In the right panel of Figure 3 we show key measurements
of the ejecta temperature. Liu & Dalgarno (1995) estimated
the temperature assuming that heating is from radioactive
decay of 56Co, whereas cooling is from adiabatic expansion,
free-free emission, recombination, C and O lines, and vibra-
tional CO lines. In their model, the ejecta consists of equal
parts of C and O. In this mixture, CO is destroyed by Comp-
ton electrons from radioactive decay and created by radia-
tive association of C and O (they provide a separate esti-
mate, also shown in the ﬁgure, with CO formation disabled).
Li et al. (1993) estimated the temperature in the nickel-rich
regions by taking into account radioactive heating and Fe,
Co, and Ni line emission cooling. Li & McCray (1993) an-
alyzed Ca II emission lines in the hydrogen envelope ejecta.
Li & McCray (1992) analyzed the ﬂux and proﬁle of two for-
bidden O I emission lines. They found that to match obser-
vations the oxygen must be absent at velocities (cid:46) 300 km s−1
whereas 0.66 M(cid:12) of oxygen occupies 10% of the volume at
velocities 300 km s−1 < v < 1400 km s−1 and 0.64 M(cid:12) occu-
pies 5% of the volume at 1400 km s−1 < v < 2100 km s−1. The
fact that the temperatures estimated from the forbidden O I
lines overlap with those derived from Liu & Dalgarno (1995)
with CO cooling disabled suggests that much of the oxygen
may be where molecules are not able to form and cool the
gas.

We use the estimates of Liu & Dalgarno (1995) to
normalize our time evolution of temperature in the shells
and the ambient gas. For dense shells, where molecules
should be able to form, we use the estimates with CO
formation enabled. In Figure 3, right panel, we show the
unnormalized Tcloudy and the normalized shell tempera-
ture Tshell(t) = 0.16 Tcloudy(t). For the ambient ejecta, to
match the atomic gas temperature estimate, we normal-
ize as Tamb(t) = 0.39 Tcloudy(t). We use the observed Fe-
Co-Ni temperatures from Li et al. (1993) to construct a
hybrid temperature model for the bubbles. In the interval
200 d < t < 1200 d, where temperature data are available,
we use a parametric ﬁt to the observations. Outside of this
period, we continuously extrapolate with an appropriately

this
We assume that

temperature model applies
throughout each of the three zones. This is a very crude
and ultimately incorrect assumption, though one without
which our ﬁrst attempt at a comprehensive dust synthesis
calculation would have proven unmanageable. In reality, the
energy emitted in the form of e± and X-rays is deposited
essentially locally as the mean free path of an electron or an
X-ray is much smaller, by a factor of at least 105 (for e±)
and at least 102 (for X-rays), than the radius of the ejecta.
The mean free path for γ-ray absorption is much longer in
comparison, e.g., for 1 MeV γ-rays it starts shorter than
the radius of the ejecta but eventually becomes almost 103
times longer. The ejecta become optically thin to γ-rays at
∼ 360–560 days depending on the photon energy. Ideally, the
radiation transfer eﬀects should be modeled realistically.

In the course of revising this manuscript in response to
the referee’s comments we performed a test of the thermal
evolution model presented in this section. In the test we car-
ried out a more accurate but simpliﬁed direct computation of
the gas temperature. We assumed that the ejecta consisted
entirely of O and CO. To compute the O cooling rate we take
electron collision strengths for the lowest 5 energy levels of
neutral oxygen from Draine (2011). For the CO cooling rate
we used the tabulated rotational and vibrational CO cool-
ing rates from Neufeld & Kaufman (1993) with corrections
from Glover et al. (2010). In this simpliﬁed calculation we

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

assumed that the molecular and ionization fractions were
both 1% and the density equaled the average density of the
ejecta. We obtained the temperature by equating the cool-
ing rate to the radioactive heating rate using the Sobolev
approximation for the optical depth. We found that com-
pared to the simpliﬁed calculation not relying on cloudy,
the cloudy-based model overestimates the temperature be-
tween 1000 and 3000 days and underestimates the temper-
ature thereafter. The simpliﬁed model also exhibits a more
substantial late increase of temperature which brings into
focus the complicated interplay of cooling and radioactive
heating.

3 CHEMISTRY

Immediately after a supernova explosion, the ejecta is ion-
ized gas. As the ejecta expand and cool, the ions recombine
into atoms and molecules form via gas-phase chemical re-
actions. Some molecules grow large enough to become what
might be called condensation nuclei, which can grow into
small grains via accretion. These grains can then grow into
larger grains by accretion and coagulation or diminish by
evaporation and chemical weathering. To model the initial
steps of the gas-to-dust transformation in supernova ejecta,
the abundances of molecular species must be explicitly fol-
lowed. The processes that modify molecular abundances,
such as gas-phase chemical reactions, reactions with and ac-
cretion onto grains, and destruction by Compton electrons,
are incorporated into the abundance evolution calculations.
We proceed to describe how this is done in our simulation.

not treat as dust grains (grains will be added to the picture
in Section 4). The chemical species include atoms, molecules,

latter being grain condensation nuclei. The species are listed
in Table 5. We explicitly follow the number density ci(t) of
species i, where i = 1, ..., NS, as a function of post-explosion
time t. The number density of each species changes due to
gas-phase chemical reactions, chemical reactions with, or
catalyzed by dust grains, accretion onto and evaporation
from grains, collisions with Compton electrons, and expan-
sion of the ejecta. The number densities ci(t) obey a system
of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations.

We include a total of NR = 341 gas-phase chemical re-
actions. We allow up to 3 reactants and up to 3 products
in each reaction. Reaction j, where j = 1, ..., NR, can be
written in the form:

R1( j) + R2( j) + R3( j) → P1( j) + P2( j) + P3( j),

(12)

where Rk ( j) is the kth reactant in reaction j and Pk ( j) is
the kth product in reaction j. If there are fewer than three
reactants or products, we set the extra ones to zero.

Each reaction j has a gas-temperature-dependent rate
coeﬃcient k j (T). The rate coeﬃcients are written in the Ar-
rhenius form:

k j (T) = Aj

(cid:19)νj

(cid:18) T
300 K

e−Ea,j/kBT,

(13)

where Aj , νj , and Ea,j are reaction-speciﬁc constants. The
exponent νj is dimensionless. The activation energy Ea,j has
the units of energy but is usually expressed as a temperature
TA,j = Ea,j/kB. The units of the coeﬃcient Aj depend on
the number of reactants: s−1 for one reactant, cm3 s−1 for
two, and cm6 s−1 for three. Reaction j has a rate per unit
volume k j (T)cR1(j)cR2(j)cR3(j), where cR3(j) = 1 if there are
two reactants and cR2(j) = cR3(j) = 1 if there is only one
reactant.

where αi j and βi j are the number of times that species i
occurs as, respectively, a product and a reactant in reaction
j.

3.2 The rate coeﬃcients

The chemical reactions that we include in our simulations
are given in Tables 13 through 39 (hereafter referred to as the
“reaction tables”). The tables give, for each reaction j, the
Arrhenius rate coeﬃcient parameters Aj , νj , and T0, j . The
numerical values of these parameters were taken from the
literature when possible. Unfortunately, not all reactions rel-
evant to dust formation have measured or calculated rates,
and the rates of those that do are only valid in certain tem-
perature and pressure range. In some cases, as we outline
here, we have had to perform informed extrapolations of the
measured or calculated rates.

The coeﬃcient for a two-body reaction A + B → C + D
is given by a thermal average of the reaction cross section
multiplied by the relative velocity vAB

(15)

where ri is the molecular radius of species i, µAB is the re-
duced mass, and Ea,AB is the activation energy (which may
be zero). This expression for the rate coeﬃcient is not in
Arrhenius form. If the activation energy is zero or much
less than kBT, then all terms involving Ea,AB vanish and the
rate coeﬃcient is in Arrhenius form. On the other hand,
if Ea,AB (cid:29) kBT then 1 + Ea,AB/kBT can be replaced with
Ea,AB/kBT and again the rate coeﬃcient is in Arrhenius
form.

A three-body reaction of the form A + B + M → AB + M,
where M is any gas particle, takes place in two steps. First
an A particle collides with a B particle forming an unstable
transition state AB∗. Then a gas particle M collides with
the transition state and removes enough of the energy of
the transition state to leave it in the form of a stable AB
molecule. The rate coeﬃcient k∗
AB for the formation of the
transition state is obtained by setting the activation energy
to zero in Equation (15).

Once the transition state forms, it has a lifetime τ∗

AB
during which it can fragment back into A and B. The mean
time between collisions with a third body for a given tran-
sition state molecule is:

τcol,AB =

where ctot is the total number density of all gas species, (cid:104)r(cid:105) is
the average radius of a gas particle, (cid:104)m(cid:105) is the mean molec-
ular weight, rAB is the radius of the transition state, and
mAB = mA + mB is the mass of the transition state.

Thus the overall volumetric three-body reaction rate can

AB. If, on
the other hand, τcol,AB < τ∗
AB, then we can assume that a
third body M will collide with the transition state before it
fragments and thus we can replace the reaction A + B + M →
AB + M with A + B → AB. The rate coeﬃcient for this
reaction is again as given in Equation (15).
For simplicity we assume that τ∗

= 2π/ω0 = 1.52 ×
10−13 s, where ω0 = 4.12 × 1013 s−1 is the angular frequency
of bonds in an Einstein solid made of carbon. Eﬀectively we
are approximating the lifetime of the transition state as the
vibrational period of the bond holding the transition state
molecule together. We are also assuming that this vibra-
tional period is similar to that of a carbon Einstein solid.
Then, with rA = rB = 6.7 × 10−9 cm (the radius of a car-
bon atom), mA = mB = 12.0 amu (the mass of a carbon
atom), (cid:104)m(cid:105) = 12.0 amu, and (cid:104)r(cid:105) = 4.69 × 10−9 cm gives a
three-body reaction coeﬃcient with Arrhenius parameters
A = 4.253 × 10−34 cm6 s−1, ν = +1, and T0 = 0 (where the
latter indicates that we are assuming there is no activation
energy). We use these parameters for all three-body reac-
tions; they agree with experimental values in the common
temperature range of validity but give rates that behave well
at low temperatures.

The reactions involving the formation of enstatite and
forsterite dimers were taken from Goumans & Bromley
(2012). The reference describes how gas phase reactions can
build up silicates such as enstatite and forsterite dimers
starting with SiO as the seed. Each reaction in their pa-
per involves either addition of a Si or Mg atom or oxida-
tion by H2O. Since in our model, hydrogen is absent in the
dust-forming-ejecta of SN 1987A, we follow the approach
of Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2013) and substitute O2 and SO
for the H2O in Goumans & Bromley (2012). Tables provid-
ing all the reactions rates are available in electronic form at
MNRAS online.

3.3 Destruction by Compton electrons

In Section 2 we discussed how radioactivity produces a popu-
lation of high energy electrons (and positrons), the so-called
Compton electrons, that can go on to ionize atoms and
molecules and dissociate molecules. We include the follow-
ing “destruction by Compton electron” reactions. For each
neutral atomic species X we include a reaction of the form:
X + e−

+ + e− + e−

∗ → X

(18)

where e−
∗ denotes the Compton electron. For each neutral di-
atomic molecule AB we include the following four reactions:

To ﬁnd the rate coeﬃcient for reactions with Compton
electrons we model the total energy per unit time that goes
into ionization and dissociation by multiplying L(t) in Equa-
tion (3) with a dimensionless factor Lion(t) = fion L(t). We
assume that this energy is equally distributed among all gas
particles. If Ntot is the total number of particles in the ejecta,
then the rate at which ionizing energy is deposited directly
onto an atom or molecule is Lion/Ntot. For each species i there
are N C
i possible reactions that can be induced by Compton
electrons (ionization, dissociation, etc.). In each reaction j
the Compton electron loses an energy W j

cient for reaction j is

3.4 The nucleation of C clusters

As an example we mention the main chemical reactions par-
ticipating in the formation of carbon clusters. The main
route to forming carbon grain condensation nuclei, which we
take to be the clusters with 4 carbon atoms (C4), involves
the following monomer inclusion reactions C+Cn → Cn+1 +γ
for n = (1, 2, 3) as well as C2 + C2 → C4 + γ. Oxygen atoms
disrupt this chain at several points. First, C + O → CO + γ
sequesters some carbon atoms so that they cannot be incor-
porated in clusters. This is somewhat oﬀset by the Compton
electron induced dissociation of carbon monoxide CO+e−
∗ →
C + O + e−
∗ . Oxygen atoms also destroy carbon clusters via
Cn + O → Cn−1 + CO. Carbon clusters can also be destroyed
by reactions with noble gas ions and Compton electrons

∗ → Cn−1 + C + e−
∗ ,

Cn + He

(n = 2, 3, 4),

(n = 2).

(23)

Once C4 forms dust grains are produced by C4 + Cn →
dust grains, where n = (1, 2, 3, 4).

At this point a caveat is in order. Carbon clusters, in-
cluding those with n (cid:29) 4, inhabit a complex conﬁguration
space where they form chains, rings, and fullerenes. The clus-
ter geometry has a strong eﬀect on the cluster stability as
can be seen in the detailed calculations of, e.g., Mauney et
al. (2015). The calculations presented in the present work
could be improved (at the cost of substantial additional nu-
merical development) by resolving all the n (cid:46) 100 clusters
by their atomic number and distinct geometric conﬁguration
with conﬁguration-speciﬁc cohesion energies. In particular
some speciﬁc chains are less stable and dust nucleation then
proceeds via other pathways.

4 GRAINS

A dust grain is a collection of atoms and molecules that
behaves as a solid body. We classify grains based on the
molecular formula of the fundamental molecular constituent
of the grain. When the molecular formula equals the fun-
damental molecular formula of a grain species, we call the
molecule a monomer of the species. An object consisting of n
monomers of some grain species is an n-mer of the species. A
dust grain is just an n-mer with a suﬃciently large number
of monomers.

4.1 Classiﬁcation

Grains of pure carbon, silicon, magnesium, and iron contain
only one element and are referred to as single-element grains.
Let X denote a monomer of a single-element grain (which is
just a single atom such as C, Si, Mg, or Fe) and Xn denote
an n-mer. In our simulation we treat X, X2, X3, and X4 as
molecular species in our non-equilibrium chemistry network.
Clusters with n > 4 are treated as grains. We track the grain
size distribution on a discrete grid of grain radii. The single-
element grain synthesis chain consists of monomers, clusters,
and grains as illustrated in Figure 4.

The monomers of multi-element grains are composed of
more than one element. They can be as simple as iron sulﬁde
(FeS) or as complex as forsterite (Mg2SiO4). It is convenient
to divide multi-element grains into two sub-classes, Cases A
and B, based on whether their monomer exists in the gas
phase. Case A multi-element grains are those that have a
monomer that can form in the gas phase. Here, such grains
include: FeS, FeO, SiC, Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, Fe3O4, and MgS.
The ﬁrst step in the formation of a Case A multi-element
grain is the formation of a monomer X from chemical re-
actions involving gas-phase precursors. Later n-mers Xn are
built from the monomers by accretion and coagulation and
can eventually grow into grains. The Case A multi-element
grain synthesis chain consists of precursors, monomers, clus-
ters, and grains, as shown in the middle section of Figure 4.
Case B multi-element grains consist of monomers that
cannot exist in the gas phase. We consider only two such
species, enstatite (MgSiO3) and forsterite (Mg2SiO4). The
ﬁrst step in the synthesis of Case B multi-element grains is
direct gas-phase formation of a dimer X2. The dimer serves
as the nucleus for n-merization by accretion and coagulation.
The Case B multi-element grain synthesis chain also consists
of precursors, clusters, and grains, as shown in the lower
section of Figure 4.

The grains formed in supernovae can be heterogeneous
mixtures aggregating diﬀerent species, e.g., mixtures of car-
bon and enstatite. To curtail computational complexity, we
did not consider heterogeneous grains. The eﬀect of hetero-
geneity would be to deplete refractory elements from the gas
phase more eﬃciently than predicted here.

4.2 Grain size discretization

3 πa3

We model dust grains as balls of densely packed monomers
in the solid phase. The treatment of molecular clusters as
spherical and densely packed is of course highly artiﬁcial—
the clusters can in fact have linear and other aspherical
geometries—but it is a necessary oversimpliﬁcation that
makes our comprehensive calculation tractable. Let m1, a1,
x1 = 4
1, and (cid:37) = m1/x1 denote the grain-species-speciﬁc
mass, radius, volume, and density of one monomer in the
solid phase. With these, mn = nm1, an = n1/3a1, xn = nx1,
and (cid:37) are the mass, radius, volume, and density of an n-mer.
For each grain species we track the number density of
precursor n-mers, which we call ‘clusters’, for all consecu-
tive n up to some maximum value nmax. Larger n-mers with
n > nmax we refer to as ‘grains’. Since we cannot separately
track the number densities of grains for all consecutive, large
n, for each grain species we discretize the grain density as a
function of the n-mer number on a logarithmic grid of grain
radii labeled by index (cid:96) (recall that the radius is in one-to-
one relation with the n-mer number and the grain volume).
Let (cid:96)max be the number of the grid points. We set the small-
est radial grid point amin to the radius of the (nmax + 1)mer
particle for all species except for enstatite and forsterite, for
which we use the radius of the (nmax + 2)mer. For the maxi-
mum radius and number of grid points we use amax = 100 µm
and (cid:96)max = 50 for all grain species. Speciﬁcally the (cid:96)th grid
point is at a(cid:96) = amin(amax/amin)((cid:96)−1)/((cid:96)max−1). To distinguish
between clusters and grains, a cluster with n monomers is
denoted with Xn, has radius an, mass mn, and number den-

grains nucleate directly from the atomic phase. The Case A multi-element grains nucleate from monomers existing in the gas phase,
whereas the Case B grains nucleate from dimers that have formed in the gas phase.

4.3 Coagulation

In our simulation clusters form via chemical binding via the
reactions included in our chemical reaction network. The
largest n-mer cluster Xnmax acting as precursor of a given
grain species is referred to as the condensation nucleus. The
condensation nucleus can grow into a grain by accretion of
gas phase precursors or by coagulation with other clusters.
It is also possible that two clusters, either or both of which
can be smaller than the condensation nucleus, can merge to
form a grain. We classify coagulation events based on the co-
agulating species and the coagulation product. The events
where two clusters collide and produce a cluster are han-
dled by the chemical reaction network. The events in which
two clusters collide and result in a grain, however, are not
considered chemical reactions but are genuine coagulation
events. The other possibilities, including cluster-grain and
grain-grain coagulation events, always lead to grains.

Coagulation is the process:

Xn1

+ Xn2 → Xn1+n2

(24)

in which grains Xn1 and Xn2 with volumes xn1 and xn2 collide
=
and adhere to form a new grain Xn1+n2 with volume xn1+n2
+ xn2 . The contribution of coagulations to the rate of

4.4 Grain charging

To compute the Coulomb correction factor we estimate the
average net electric charge on grains at each radial grid
point. Grains become charged due to photoelectric absorp-
tion of UV photons and thermal electron and ion capture.

perature Te collide with a grain with radius a and charge Ze

We assume that the electrons stick to the grain and ig-

grain charge due to collisions with thermal, free electrons
is (dZ/dt)e− = −Γe− .

The rate at which ions with number density cion, charge

We assume that an ion that hits the grain sticks to it so that
the time derivative of grain charge due to collisions with ions
is (dZ/dt)ion = +zionΓion.

We follow Weingartner et al. (2006) and Draine & Sutin
(1987) to ﬁnd an expression for the rate at which electrons
are ejected from a grain by photoelectric absorption. The
general formula for the photoelectric ejection rate is:

Γγ =

∫ ∞

0

nγ(E)Qabs(E, a)πa2cY (E, a, Z)dE,

(39)

where Y (E, a, Z) is the photoelectric yield, namely, the av-
erage number of electrons ejected from a grain of radius a
and charge Ze when it absorbs a photon with energy E, and
Qabs(E, a) is the absorption coeﬃcient deﬁned such that the
cross section for a grain to absorb a photon of energy E is
σabs(E, a) = Qabs(E, a)πa2. For the absorption coeﬃcient of
all grain species we used an online table5 based on Draine &
Lee (1984) and Laor & Draine (1993). This table provides
grain radius and photon energy dependent absorption coeﬃ-
cients for graphite spheres with radii 1 nm ≤ a ≤ 10 µm. For

smaller grains we assume that Qabs(E, a) ∝ a and for larger
grains that Qabs(E, a) is independent of radius. We plot the
absorption coeﬃcient as a function of the grain radius and

The equilibrium charge is found by setting dZ/dt = 0
and solving for Z. We assume that all grain species have
the same grain-radius-dependent charge computed accord-
ing to the just described procedure substituting the val-
ues of Qabs, Y , and W speciﬁc to carbon grains. We set
Te = Tion = Tgas, zion = +1, mion = 20.3 amu, and cion =
ce = 2.94 × 108 cm−3(t/100 days)−3 in all calculations (includ-
ing those pertaining to the bubble and ambient density re-
gions). We plot the equilibrium grain charge Zdust in the
right panel of Figure 6.

4.5 Grain temperature

The temperature of a dust grain can be diﬀerent from the
temperature of the gas and is an important parameter be-
cause the evaporation rate, as we discuss below, depends on
the grain temperature exponentially. We explicitly compute
the grain temperature as a function of grain radius. For the
purpose of this calculation only, we assume the grain is pure
carbon regardless of its actual composition. Dust grains heat
by absorbing photons from the UV radiation ﬁeld and cool
by emitting IR photons. They also exchange energy with the
surrounding gas via gas-grain collisions. We ignore the heat-
ing and cooling due to evaporation, accretion, coagulation,
and chemical reactions.

The rate at which the internal energy U of a grain with

radius a increases through absorption of UV photons is:

gas density we use

2.23 ×
1011 cm−3(t/100 days)−3 and for average gas particle mass
we use (cid:104)m(cid:105) = 3.07 × 10−23 g. These are valid in the bubble
shells but we also use them for ambient and nickel bubble
regions. Fixing the gas density here to the density in the
shells is justiﬁed by noting that in the period 100–1000 days
after the explosion when the dust forms, the collisional gas-
dust coupling is negligible compared to the dust’s thermal
coupling to radiation.6 E.g., for small 1 nm grains we have
Labs (cid:38) 100×Lgas. Therefore the dust temperature is not sen-
sitive to gas density. In Figure 8 we plot grain temperature
as a function of time and grain radius.

4.6 Evaporation

Atoms at the surface of a dust grain can be ejected into the
gas phase in a process called evaporation (or sublimation).
To calculate the evaporation rate as a function of radius
and grain temperature we follow Guhathakurta & Draine
(1989) and idealize a grain as consisting of N atoms, each
connected to the lattice with a spring. Each atom can vibrate
in three independent directions so the grain has 3N degrees
of freedom. Since 6 of these correspond to translation and
rotation of the grain as a whole, the grain has F = 3N −
6 vibrational degrees of freedom. The internal or thermal
energy U of the grain is distributed over these vibrational
degrees of freedom.

We assume that each grain species behaves as an Ein-
stein solid with Debye temperature TD. The vibrational de-
grees of freedom are treated as quantum harmonic oscilla-
tors with angular frequency ω0 = (π/6)1/3kBTD/(cid:126). The total
number of vibrational quanta in a grain is U/(cid:126)ω0 and the
average number of quanta per vibrational degree of freedom
is γ = U/(cid:126)ω0F. The values of TD used in our simulation are
given in Table 8.

6 At 500 days the number density of UV photons is ≈ 2.3 ×
107 cm−3. If a 1 nm grain has an absorption coeﬃcient of Qabs =
0.001 and all photons have energy 4.43 eV then that grain will ab-
sorb 22 photons per second which translates to a heating rate
of ≈ 1.6 × 10−10 erg s−1. At 500 days the mean gas density is
≈ 1.2 × 108 cm−3 and the molecular gas temperature is ≈ 900 K.
Thus the mean speed of a gas molecules, assuming that each
molecule has a mass of one oxygen atom, is ≈ 2 km s−1. The rate
at which gas molecules collide with the grain is ≈ 0.004 s−1. If each
gas molecule transfers an energy 1
2 kBT to the grain, the heating
rate is ≈ 2.5 × 10−16 erg s−1. Thus the radiative heating rate is
O(106) times larger than the gas heating rate and thus, evidently,
the gas heating is negligible.

Dust formation in SN 1987A

The number of quanta in a vibrational degree of freedom
ﬂuctuates as energy shifts between atoms in a grain. Every
once in a while, one vibrational degree of freedom has so
much energy that the atom becomes unbound and is ejected
from the grain. The surface binding energy of the atom to
the grain of radius a and surface tension σST is:
Ebind = kB A − 4πr2

1 σST[(n − 1)2/3 − (n − 2)2/3],
where A is the bulk binding energy of an atom to the grain
divided by the Boltzmann constant. Then, for evaporation
to occur, the number of quanta that must be concentrated
in a single vibrational degree of freedom is b = Ebind/(cid:126)ω0.
For single-element grains evaporation is the process:

(50)

Xn → Xn−1 + X.

(51)

This occurs at a rate per unit volume kevap(T, n)cn, where,
in the limit in which the grains are in thermal equilibrium
with the gas, the evaporation rate coeﬃcient is:

kevap(T, n) = pssna2
n

(cid:115)

8π
kBT m1

e−Ebind/kBT +B.

(52)

Here ps = 106 dyne cm−2 is the standard pressure, sn is the
sticking coeﬃcient (which we take to be unity), and B is a
parameter that depends on the grain composition (i.e., the
species). This expression was derived by setting the evapo-
ration rate equal to the condensation rate when the partial
pressure equals the vapor pressure (Nozawa & Kozasa 2013).
The values of the parameters A, B, σST, and r1 that we use
can be found in Table 7.

In reality, grains may not be in thermal equilibrium with
the gas. The gas density can be so low that thermal ﬂuctu-
ations within a grain occur much faster than the grain ex-
changes energy with the the ambient atoms and molecules.
Therefore, the energy needed to remove an atom from a
grain may have to come from a thermal ﬂuctuation within
the grain itself. We can account for this thermal isolation by
multiplying the evaporation rate coeﬃcient with a dimen-
sionless suppression factor SN . The suppression factor is the
ratio of the actual probability that there will be at least
b quanta in one vibrational degree of freedom to what that
probability would be if the grain were in thermal equilibrium
with the gas. The probability that there is at least b quanta
in one vibrational degree of freedom is (Guhathakurta &
Draine 1989):

˜pF (γ, b) =

(γF)!(γF − b + F − 1)!
(γF + F − 1)!(γF − b)!

.

(53)

The same probability if the grain were coupled to a heat
bath and thus F → ∞ would be:

˜p∞(γ, b) =

(cid:18) γ
1 + γ

(cid:19) b

.

(54)

Dividing Equation (53) with (54) gives the suppression fac-
tor (Guhathakurta & Draine 1989):

(59)

where Ai denote molecular species. Table 8 gives the coef-
ﬁcients of evaporative reactions for all grain species. We as-
sume that the evaporation rate, in monomers per unit time,
can be approximated with Equation (52), but now with ‘n’
interpreted as the number of monomers in the grain. The
parameters needed to calculate the evaporation rate of a
multi-element grain can also be found in Table 7–8. The
suppression factor and evaporation rate for carbon grains
are plotted in Figure 7.

4.7 Accretion

Accretion is the inverse process of evaporation in which sub-
monomeric fragments (or molecular monomer precursors;
e.g., Mg, O, or SiO for a forsterite Mg2SiO4 grain) collide
with and are absorbed by a grain. Suppose that accretion
can be parametrized by stoichiometric coeﬃcients ν1, ..., νN :

Xn + ν1A1 + ... + νN A N → Xn+1.

(62)

Each molecular species Ai collides with the grain at a rate
(cid:112)8πkBT/mAi . We deﬁne the key species as the one
a2cAi
with the lowest collision rate. The rate at which monomers
are accreted to the grain is:

kacc =

(63)

where the subscript ‘key’ designates the quantities associ-
ated with the key species. Discretizing this on the grid of
grain radii we obtain the reaction:

Z(cid:96) + δn(cid:96)(ν1A1 + ... + νN A N ) → Z(cid:96)+1.

This reaction occurs at a rate per unit volume:

4.8 Weathering

Chemical weathering refers to the process in which atoms
(and ions) in the gas phase collide with a grain and chemi-
cally react with an atom in the grain resulting in the removal
of the latter atom from the grain. Like evaporation, chemical
weathering is a grain destruction process. A prominent form
of weathering is by noble gas ions. When an He+ ion collides
with a grain it can steal an electron to recombine. The re-
combination energy goes into the grain and can result the
ejection of an atom from the grain. In single element grains
this corresponds to the reaction:

Xn + He

+ → Xn−1 + X+ + He.

(68)

We take the rate per unit volume of this reaction to be
kHecHe+ cn, where the coeﬃcient is (Lazzati & Heger 2016):
kHe = 1.6 × 10−9 cm3 s−1 × n2/3.

(69)

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

Dust formation in SN 1987A

21

This value is for carbon grains but we adopt it for all single-
element grains.

For multi-element grains we assume that He+ ions
collide with grains and remove one atom at a time at
the same rate as in single element grains. More precisely,
let (X1)η1 (X2)η2 (X3)η3 be the chemical formula for the
monomer of some grain species, where Xk is the kth ele-
ment and ηk the number of atoms of that element. Then
helium weathering corresponds to the reaction:

(72)

In principle, Ne+ and Ar+ can also contribute to weathering.
We assume that this occurs with the same rate coeﬃcient
as for helium.

When a neutral oxygen atom collides with a carbon
grain it can remove a carbon atom and form a CO molecule
that is ejected into the gas phase. This corresponds to the
reaction:
Cn + O → Cn−1 + CO.
We take the rate of this reaction from Lazzati & Heger
(2016):
kO = 10−11e−1130.0 K/T n2/3 cm3 s−1.
We only include this process, which is called oxygen weath-
ering, for carbon grains.

(73)

(74)

Oxygen weathering is discretized on the grid of grain
radii as follows. The eﬀective reaction on grain radial grid
points is

Z(cid:96) + δn(cid:96)−1O → Z(cid:96)−1 + δn(cid:96)−1CO

This occurs at a rate per unit volume of

Here, (dci/dt)chem is from Equation (14), (dci/dt)Compt is
from Equations (21) and (22), (dci/dt)coag is from Equa-
tion (29), (dci/dt)evap is from Equations (60) and (61),
(dci/dt)acc is from Equations (66) and (67), (dci/dt)weath is
from Equations (72) and (77), and the last term on the right
is the overall decrease of number density due to homologous
expansion. The ODEs are integrated with a Bulirsch-Stoer-
type, semi-implicit extrapolation mid-point method (Bader
& Deuﬂhard 1983).

Our science suite of consists of 108 integrations, specif-
ically 8, 50, and 50 integrations in the nickel bubbles, am-
bient ejecta, and dense shells, respectively. The integrations
covered mass coordinate ranges 1.82M(cid:12) < M < 1.89M(cid:12) in
the nickel bubbles and 1.89M(cid:12) < M < 6.81M(cid:12) for the am-
bient ejecta and dense shells. Each integration was started
at 100 days after the explosion and carried out until a post-
explosion time of 104 d. Since at 104 d, the speciﬁc dust for-
mation rate is |d ln Mdust,tot/dt|−1 ∼ 4000 years, no signiﬁcant
dust growth is expected at still later times.

The density in the shells depends on their thickness rel-
ative to the bubble radius. This thickness is not constrained
by observations and one should vary the shell thickness as a
parameter. We found very overdense shell integrations too
computationally expensive, and thus, simulated shells only
as dense as four times the ambient ejecta density. Speciﬁ-
cally, we ran the shell integrations at three diﬀerent densi-
ties, 1, 2, and 4 times the density in the ambient ejecta.

We performed a convergence test by running a suite of in-
tegrations that are identical except for the number of radial
mesh points (cid:96)max. In the test, the density was set to the am-
bient ejecta density, the temperature was set to the atomic
temperature evolution track (Figure 3, right panel), the mass
fraction of C was set to 0.3, the mass fractions of He, O, Mg,
Al, Si, S, and Fe were set to 0.1.

The left panel of Figure 9 shows the carbon grain size
distribution in the form a4dN/da at the end of the simula-
tions, 104 days after the explosion. The maximum fractional

creases monotonically in (cid:96)max and drops to ≈ 0.5 for the

smaller. The location of the peak of a4dN/da is accurate
independent of (cid:96)max.

The right panel of Figure 9 shows the mass in car-
bon grains as a function of time. The maximum fractional
residual in the ﬁnal carbon grain mass drops to ≈ 0.5 for
(cid:96)max = 50. The fractional residual in the CO number density
at the end of the simulation, not shown, drops below 0.01
for the same number of grid points.

6 RESULTS

The model described in the preceding sections can be applied
to arbitrary core collapse supernovae. The speciﬁc objective
of the numerical integrations we present here is to assess
the eﬃciency of dust production in SN 1987A. From each
integration we derive the dust mass synthesized as a function
of grain composition and size. Diﬀerent integrations sample
the various chemically and hydrodynamically distinct zones.
Our presentation of the results is structured as follows.
We ﬁrst analyze how dust mass is partitioned as a function
of grain size and composition and how refractory element
mass is partitioned between molecules and grains of diﬀer-
ent sizes. Then we examine the evolution of grain mass by

We analyze the shape of the grain size (or, equivalently, grain
mass) distribution at 104 days. Next we turn the evolution of
the abundance of important molecules and how their abun-
dances are distributed throughout the ejecta. Finally, we dis-
cuss how the grain properties depend on the mass density
in the dense shells compressed by nickel bubbles.

6.1 Grains

Figure 8 shows the dust temperature as a function of time
and grain radius. At a given radius the temperature drops
rapidly with time. For example, the temperature of 1 nm
grains is ∼ 4500 K at 100 days; it drops to ∼ 350 K at 1000
days and further to ∼ 70 K at 104 days. The temperature
of grains with radii above a micron starts at ∼ 2000 K at
100 days and already drops to ∼ 60 K by 1000 days. At 104
days the dust temperature is (cid:46) 20 K which is consistent
with the dust temperature inferred by Zanardo et al. (2014)
from observations with Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) and ALMA. The impact of the dust temperature on
the evaporation rate can seen in the right panel of Figure 7.
The evaporation rate, which depends on the dust tempera-
ture, drops quickly to become completely negligible after 300
days. The rate of accretion onto grains, which depends on
the higher gas temperature, does not drop as fast. There-
fore, after 300 days, grain growth proceeds unimpeded by
evaporation and is only modulated by noble gas weathering.
In Table 9 we provide the dust mass synthesized a func-
tion of grain size for each of the grain species. At the end of
the simulation the total dust mass produced was ≈ 0.5 M(cid:12),
the bulk of which, ≈ 0.3 M(cid:12), was in medium size grains
(10 nm ≤ a < 100 nm), and another ≈ 0.1 M(cid:12) each in large
(0.1 µm ≤ a < 1 µm) and very large (1 µm ≤ a < 10 µm)
grains.

Table 10 provides the partitioning of the elemental
mass into diﬀerent chemical products. Overall, the simulated
ejecta contains noble gases (He, Ne, and Ar) and refractory
elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe). In the simulation
the noble gases comprise 1.8 M(cid:12) or 37% of the core mass,
whereas the refractory elements, which can be incorporated
in grains, comprise 3.1 M(cid:12) or 62%. Approximately 16% of
this refractory mass has ended up in grains at 104 days. The
rest of the refractory mass remained in atomic form (2.5 M(cid:12)
or 82%) with a small fraction locked in molecules, predomi-
nantly diatomic (0.069 M(cid:12) or 2%).

In Figure 10 we plot the evolution of the dust mass in
each of the three ejecta zones: the nickel bubbles, the ambi-
ent ejecta, and the dense shells at the bubble and ambient
ejecta interface. The total dust mass in all zones and the
observations from Bevan & Barlow (2016), Wesson et al.
(2015), and Dwek & Arendt (2015) are also shown on the
lower right panel; we compare the computed and observa-
tionally inferred masses in Section 7.2 below.

Dust formation is rapid between 215 and 620 days after
the explosion. The average dust growth rate is ∼ 0.3 M(cid:12) yr−1.
After 620 days, dust formation continues at a much slower
rate ∼ 0.006 M(cid:12) yr−1. There are actually ﬁve distinct epochs
when the dust growth rate dMdust/dt spikes. Peak dust for-
mation rate, mostly due to the formation in shells, occurs
at 229 days for forsterite, 332 days for magnesia, 382 days
for iron sulﬁde, 528 days for silicon, and 2551 days for car-

bon. The overall dust formation rate peaks at dMdust/dt ≈
1 M(cid:12) yr−1 at 332 days.

Most of the dust forms in the dense shells (0.32 M(cid:12)
or 63% of the total mass). Less forms in the ambient
ejecta (0.18 M(cid:12) or 37%), and very little in the bubbles
(5 × 10−7 M(cid:12)). This reﬂects the strong density dependence of
dust yield: the nucleation rate is proportional to the square
of the number density (dci/dt)nuc ∝ c2
1 and the accretion
rate is proportional to the density (dci/dt)acc ∝ c1. It is also
because at high densities the ionization fraction, and thus
the weathering rate, is lower.

Not only the grain mass produced but also its chemical
composition diﬀers between the ambient and shell zones.
Carbon and iron grains have a signiﬁcantly higher mass in
dense shells than in ambient ejecta. Alumina, iron oxide, and
magnetite grains do not form at all in the ambient ejecta
but do form in signiﬁcant amounts in the dense shells. All
other grain species are produced in similar quantities in the
ambient ejecta and shells.

Table 11 provides the dust yield classiﬁed by grain
species. The eight most abundant grain species are: mag-
nesia (0.16 M(cid:12) or 32% of the total dust mass), silicon
(0.15 M(cid:12) or 29%), forsterite (0.092 M(cid:12) or 18.0%), iron sul-
ﬁde (0.04 M(cid:12) or 7.78%), carbon (0.031 M(cid:12) or 6.1%), silicon
dioxide (0.021 M(cid:12) or 4%), alumina (0.013 M(cid:12) or 2.4%), and
iron (0.0062 M(cid:12) or 1.2%).

A variety of competing eﬀects inﬂuences the evolution
of the mass in a grain species. At the earliest times grains
are hot and evaporation completely inhibits grain growth.
As the grain temperature drops, the evaporation rate de-
creases exponentially, and at some point it becomes negli-
gible. Then, chemical weathering becomes the main grain
destruction process. But even this is progressively less sig-
niﬁcant as the ionized fraction gradually decreases (it never
becomes completely negligible). Dust formation ceases when
the accretion time exceeds the expansion time. Coagulation
does not aﬀect the total dust mass although it modiﬁes the
size distribution. However, the coagulation rate is always
lower than the accretion rate because the abundance of ma-
terial in clusters that can accrete onto a grain is always
higher that in other grains.

The sudden rise of carbon dust mass at ∼ 2000 days is
due to grain formation in the dense shells located in the mass
coordinate range 4.5–7 M(cid:12). There, the bulk of the mass is in
helium and the abundance of He+ is very high. For example,
at the mass coordinate 5.7 M(cid:12) we ﬁnd that the He+ relative
abundance is 10% at 100 days and 0.06% at 1000 days. At
1830 days the He+ abundance reaches a minimum of 0.04%
and thereafter increases steadily to 0.2% at 104 days. Thus,
∼ 2000 days is when the He+ weathering is at a relative min-
imum and this is the optimal time to produce carbon dust.
The carbon dust mass increase between 300 and 400 days
seen in Figure 10 occurs at mass coordinate ∼ 4.8 M(cid:12) where
the abundance of carbon exceeds that of helium and thus
helium weathering is not an obstacle. Carbon is substan-
tially more abundant than helium between 2 M(cid:12) and 5 M(cid:12),
but inwards of 4.5 M(cid:12), carbon dust formation is poor due
to decreasing carbon mass fraction, the presence of the two
other noble gas ions, Ne+ and Ar+, and an increasing oxygen
abundance and thus stronger oxygen weathering.

Figure 11 shows the mass fraction in each of the grain
species as a function of the mass coordinate within the ejecta

at the end of the simulation. The low-density bubbles form
only a very small amount of silicon and iron grains with a
total depletion fraction of 10−7–10−5. In the ambient ejecta
grains form in signiﬁcant amounts for M < 4.5 M(cid:12). Speciﬁ-
cally, silicon and iron sulﬁde dominate the grain mass frac-
tion for M < 2.25 M(cid:12), and some iron grains are present there
as well. For 2.25 M(cid:12) < M < 4.5 M(cid:12), magnesia is the dom-
inant grain species, followed by silicon dioxide, forsterite,
and enstatite. In the carbon-rich region 4.5 M(cid:12) < M < 5 M(cid:12)
some carbon grains manage to form, comprising only a small
mass fraction (∼ 10−6–10−5). Grains are practically absent
in the helium rich outer core M > 5 M(cid:12).

The shell ejecta produce the highest diversity of grain
species. The innermost region (M < 2.25 M(cid:12)) again forms
silicon,
iron sulﬁde, and iron grains. The next region
(2.25 M(cid:12) < M < 4.5 M(cid:12)) forms, in decreasing order of yield:
forsterite, magnesia, silicon dioxide, alumina, silicon, silicon
carbide, and enstatite. The carbon-rich region 4.5 M(cid:12) < M <
5 M(cid:12) froms carbon and magnesia grains. The outermost he-
lium core M > 5 M(cid:12) forms only carbon grains. In the entire
ejecta carbon grains only form when M > 4.5 M(cid:12) and they
mostly form in the dense shells.

Figure 12 shows the logarithmic size distribution (grains
per log grain radius) at the end of the simulation. The dis-
tribution peaks at 5.3 ˚A in the bubbles and 66 ˚A in the am-
bient ejecta, shells, and overall ejecta. We also plot the mass
in grains per unit logarithmic radius dMdust, p/d ln a at the
end of the simulation in Figure 13. This distribution peaks
at 50.5 ˚A, 682 ˚A, 526 ˚A, and 682 ˚A in the bubbles, ambient
ejecta, shells, and total ejecta, respectively. The total grain
size distribution beyond the peak is approximately a power
law:

dN
d ln a

∝ a−3.4.

(80)

This is steeper than the classical grain size distribution in the
ISM, dN/d ln a ∝ a−2.5 (Mathis et al. 1977). The sharp rise
of dMdust, p/d ln a with radius at the largest radii, a (cid:38) 10 µm,
is an artifact of a numerical instability of our time primitive
discretization scheme.

The solid dashed line is the total dust mass summed over all grain species.

6.2 Molecules

The molecules CO, SiO, SO, and O2 play important roles in
dust formation. CO locks up carbon atoms so they cannot be
added to carbon and silicon carbide grains. SiO is required
to form the condensation nuclei of enstatite, forsterite, and
silicon dioxide, whereas SO and O2 are oxidizing agents that
play a role in the formation of enstatite, forsterite, iron
oxide, alumina, iron sulﬁde, magnesia, magnesium sulﬁde,
magnetite, and silicon carbide.

The left panel in Figure 14 shows the mass of CO, SiO,
SO, and O2 as a function of time in each of the density
zones, as well as the mass of atomic C, O, Si, and S. In
contrast to the dust mass, the mass in molecules is relatively
constant over the entire 100–104 day period. At the end of
the simulation, the total mass in CO, SiO, SO, and O2 is

similar age of the remnant Liu et al. (1992) inferred a higher value
of 0.001 M(cid:12), an order of magnitude smaller than our prediction.
At ∼ 104 days Kamenetzky et al. (2013) inferred a CO mass of
0.01 M(cid:12), again an order of magnitude smaller than ours at the
corresponding time. The SiO mass is well above the value 4 ×
10−6 M(cid:12) inferred by Roche et al. (1991) at 500 days.

density zone. Virtually no molecules form in the bubbles
due to the low density and high ionization fraction. Outside
of the bubbles molecules mostly form at mass coordinates
2 M(cid:12) < M < 5 M(cid:12), with more molecules forming in the shells
than in the ambient ejecta. At M > 5 M(cid:12) the high abundance
of helium suppresses molecules in both the ambient ejecta
and the shells.

In the right panel in Figure 14 we show the mass frac-
tion of the weathering agents He+, Ne+, Ar+, and O as a
function of mass coordinate. It can be seen that noble gas
weathering is dominated by helium for M > 5 M(cid:12), neon for
3 M(cid:12) < M < 5 M(cid:12), and argon for M < 3 M(cid:12). Since the mass
fraction of Ne+ and Ar+ for M < 5 M(cid:12) is 104 times below
that of He+ for M > 5 M(cid:12), neon and argon weathering are
relatively insigniﬁcant compared to helium weathering. The
large diversity of grain species over the mass coordinates
2 M(cid:12) < M < 5 M(cid:12) is in part due to the lack of noble gas

weathering agents there. However, oxygen is very abundant
in this region and its weathering suppresses carbon grain
formation.

6.3 Dependance on shell density

Recall that we varied the shell density between 1, 2, and
4 times the mass density in the ambient ejecta. The cor-
responding grain masses as a function of time, grain mass
fractions as a function of the enclosed mass, and grain size
distributions at the end of the simulation are shown in Fig-
ure 15. Grains form slightly earlier at higher shell densities
and the total dust mass is larger. The dust mass created in
the shells can be approximated with the power law:

where ρ0 is the shell density at 100 days. The normalization
factor in Equation (81) is of course speciﬁc to our model
of SN 1987A. The grain species mass fractions at a given
mass coordinate are not very sensitive to the mass density
in the shell, except for those of alumina and carbon grains.
In the case of alumina, its abundance in the region 2.5 M(cid:12) <
M < 4.5 M(cid:12) sharply increases with density. Similarly, the
abundance of carbon grains increases in the helium shell
M > 5 M(cid:12).

7 DISCUSSION

7.1 Comparison with previous work in MNT

Recall that there are three frameworks for modeling dust
formation in supernovae, in the increasing order of com-

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

putational complexity: classical nucleation theory (CNT),
kinetic nucleation theory (KNT), and molecular nucleation
theory (MNT). Our work is an extension of MNT, which
was developed in Cherchneﬀ & Lilly (2008), Cherchneﬀ &
Dwek (2009, 2010), Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2013, 2015), and
Biscaro & Cherchneﬀ (2014, 2016).

Our model is similar to that of Sarangi & Cherchn-
eﬀ (2015) (hereafter SC15). These authors used MNT to
compute the grain mass versus time and grain size distribu-
tion for 8 grain species (forsterite, alumina, carbon, magne-
sium, silicon carbide, silicon, iron, and iron sulﬁde). They
considered four explosion scenarios involving two progenitor
masses, 15 M(cid:12) and 19 M(cid:12), and ran the simulations from 100
to 2000 days after the explosion. For the 15 M(cid:12) progenitor
they considered a case with normal 56Ni production and a
case with a 56Ni mass of only 0.01 M(cid:12). For the 19 M(cid:12) pro-

genitor they considered smooth as well as clumpy ejecta. In
all cases they divided the ejecta into 6 or 7 annular shells,
each of which was characterized by a density, temperature,
elemental composition, and number and size of clumps.

Before comparing our simulation results to SC15, we
should note some model diﬀerences other than physical pro-
cess prescriptions; we discuss those at the end of this subsec-
tion. The mass densities in their zones were approximately
1.6 times our shell density in their 15 M(cid:12) progenitor models
and 0.62 times our shell density in their 19 M(cid:12) progenitor
models. In the clumps in their 19 M(cid:12) progenitor models the
density varied from 8 to 162 times our shell density. Overall,
their densities are higher than ours by as much as two orders
of magnitude. The temperatures in SC15 are higher than
ours initially, at ∼ 100 days, but as they follow power-laws,
they drop below our temperatures after few hundred days
(recall that we explicitly model, but the power-laws ignore,
the late heating by 57Co and ultimately 44Ti radioactivity
that slows the early cooling trend). The elemental composi-
tions in SC15 are averaged over coarse annual shells, while
ours are taken from discrete mass coordinates each having a
diﬀerent composition as provided by the mesa calculation;
therefore, we do not assume that the explosion hydrody-
namics can drive microscopic mixing. Finally, we include six
additional grain species: enstatite, magnetite, silicon diox-
ide, magnesium sulﬁde, magnesia, and iron oxide.

For concreteness, we focus comparison on SC15’s 19 M(cid:12)
model with clumpy ejecta that is the closest to our simula-
tion other than for having much higher ejecta density. At
2000 days after the explosion, the dust mass in our model
was 0.44 M(cid:12) while it was 0.14 M(cid:12) in theirs. Our higher mass
can be attributed to grain growth by accretion; SC15 in-
cluded only growth by coagulation. Our overall grain mass
evolution for forsterite, alumina, iron sulﬁde, and silicon is
similar to that in the SC15 model, although in each case
these grain species form later in our simulations owing to
lower densities. Carbon grains form much earlier in our sim-
ulations than in the SC15 model, while magnesium grains
are completely absent in our simulation but are present in
theirs. The lack of magnesium grains in our simulation is
due to quick elemental magnesium depletion into magnesia
grains, a species not included in SC15. The peak radii of the
grain mass distributions agree to within a factor of a few
for forsterite, carbon, alumina, iron, and iron sulﬁde. Our
silicon mass distribution peaks at signiﬁcantly larger radii
than in the SC15 model.

We now return to the physical process improvements
over SC15. We include the eﬀects of evaporation (sublima-
tion) on grain growth and of ﬁnite grain size on the evap-
oration rate. We include the weathering of grains by noble
gas ions and oxygen atoms (the latter in the case of car-
bon grains), whereas SC15 included only the corresponding
processes for molecules. We compute the grain temperature
to which the evaporation rate is sensitive separately from
the gas temperature. In fact, it seems that most previous
investigations simply set the dust temperature equal to the
gas temperature (SC15 did not need the grain temperature
as they did not treat evaporation). We compute the grain
charge and its eﬀects on the coagulation rate. We treat grain
growth by accretion and coagulation, whereas SC15 treated
only the latter process. We extend our simulation to 104 days
and include the eﬀects of radioactive decay of 56,57Co, 44Ti,

and 22Na on the ejecta temperature evolution and chem-
istry and on grain temperature and charge; SC15 simulated
to 2,000 days and only treated 56Co decay.

7.2 Observations

As dust begins to form, it reprocesses the optical and UV
into the IR. The thermal emission from dust is initially in
the near-IR (for Tdust > 500K) but gradually shifts to the
mid-IR (for 100 K < Tdust < 500 K) and ultimately the far-IR
(for Tdust < 100K). Much of the thermal radiation emitted
by grains cannot be observed from the earth’s surface due to
atmospheric absorption. At the time that SN 1987A was ob-
served, there would not be infrared space telescopes for an-
other 8 years. However, measurements of the infrared SED
were made from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) at
60, 250, 415, 615, and 775 days after the explosion (Wooden
et al. 1993). Note the 200 day gap in the observations be-
tween 415 and 615 days. This is the period when most of
the dust mass seems to have formed, as the percentage of
the bolometric luminosity contributed by the IR jumps from
2% at 415 days to 45% at 615 days and then to 83% at 775
days. The much later mid-IR observations with the Spitzer
Space Telescope (after 5,800 days), the far-IR observations
with the Herschel Space Observatory (after 8,000 days), and
sub-mm observations with ALMA (after 9,000 days) are now
providing a much more complete picture of dust properties
in the remnant.

Attempts have been made to use the observations from
KAO, Spitzer, Herschel, and ALMA (and optical/UV ob-
servations from telescopes such as the Hubble Space Tele-
scope) to determine the time evolution of grain properties
in the ejecta of SN 1987A. This is done by ﬁtting a dust
reprocessing model to the SED. The ejecta is assumed to be
divided into an inner heavy element core where grains form
in high density clumps, a helium shell, and a hydrogen enve-
lope. The grain mass, composition, size distribution, spatial
distribution within clumps, and as well as the clump spatial
distribution are varied until the resulting SED matches the
observations. We discuss the three major attempts to do this
in SN 1987A: Wesson et al. (2015), Bevan & Barlow (2016),
and Dwek & Arendt (2015).

Wesson et al. (2015) used three dimensional radiative
transfer simulations with mocassin (Ercolano et al. 2005) to
calculate the SED of SN 1987A over the wavelength range
0.3 µm < λ < 100 µm at 615, 775, 1153, 1300, 8515, and
9200 days after the explosion. They found that in order to
match the observed SEDs, the grain mass should increase
from 0.001 M(cid:12) at 615 days to 0.8 M(cid:12) at 9200 days and that
the grain size distribution has power-law slope dN/da ∝ a−3.5
with grain sizes between 0.005 µm and 0.25 µm in the pe-
riod between 615 and 1300 days and between 3.005 µm and
3.25 µm in the period between 8515 and 9200 days. The grain
mass increases from 0.02 M(cid:12) at 1300 days to 0.6 M(cid:12) at 8515
days. This means that 72.5% of the ﬁnal dust mass formed
between these two times and that 25% of the dust mass
formed between 8515 and 9090 days (so that 97.5% of the
dust mass formed after 1300 days).

Bevan & Barlow (2016) performed three dimensional
Monte Carlo radiative transfer to model the emission line
blueshifting in the presence of dust. Their results ﬁll in some
of the gaps between days 1300 and 8515 in Wesson et al.

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

(2015). The results of Wesson et al. (2015) and Bevan &
Barlow (2016) can be combined to arrive at the conclusion—
one that is controversial in view of the remaining of the
three observational attempts and the theoretical predictions
of SC15—that dust mass increases as a power law in time:
Mdust,tot,1987A ∝ t2.5. These results, which assume spherically-
symmetric ejecta, are questioned by Larsson et al. (2016),
who used spatially resolved spectra at optical and near IR
wavelengths to determine the 3D distribution of H, He, O,
Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe at 104 days. The distribution of these
elements was suﬃciently anisotropic to explain on its own
the spectral line distortion that Bevan & Barlow (2016) at-
tribute to dust.

Dwek & Arendt (2015) used observations at 615, 775,
1144, 8815, and 9090 days and modeled the dust as amor-
phous carbon and enstatite. At 615, 775, and 1144 days, the
clumps are optically thick to the radiation emitted by the
grains and the ejecta already contains 0.4 M(cid:12) of enstatite
and 0.047M(cid:12) of carbon. By 8815 days the clumps become
optically thin and the carbon and enstatite have coagulated
to make composite grains that are essentially an enstatite
matrix with carbon inclusions (18% of the volume of the
grains is occupied by the carbon inclusions). The total dust
mass is 0.42 M(cid:12) at 8815 days and 0.45 M(cid:12) at 9090 days.8

While the estimates of Bevan & Barlow (2016) and Wes-
son et al. (2015) agree, they diﬀer drastically with those
of Dwek & Arendt (2015). The most important diﬀerence
is that dust mass continuously increases for all times af-
ter 615 days in Bevan & Barlow (2016) and Wesson et al.
(2015) while almost all of the dust has already formed by 615
days in Dwek & Arendt (2015). It is important to note that
the discrepancy in inferred dust mass between the groups is
highest at 615 days when the estimates diﬀer by a factor of
447 and decreases with time, coming into near agreement at
9090 days. Another discrepancy is in the inferred composi-
tion: Wesson et al. (2015) ﬁnd that 15% of the dust mass
is in silicates and 85% is in carbon while Dwek & Arendt
(2015) ﬁnd that 89.5% of the dust mass is in enstatite (a
silicate) and 10.5% in carbon.

The disagreement in the ﬁrst 1000 days may be due to
the very diﬀerent approaches to radiative transfer by Wes-
son et al. (2015) and Dwek & Arendt (2015). Wesson et
al. (2015) used a fully 3D radiative transfer calculation to
model the SED while Dwek & Arendt (2015) used a simple
formula for the probability that a photon will escape from
a dusty sphere. The two techniques give dramatically dif-
ferent values for what the ﬂux at 100 µm should be for a
given amount of dust mass (the observed ﬂux at 626 days
at 100 µm is 0.6 Jy). According to Wesson et al. (2015), the
dust mass at 615 days cannot exceed 0.01 M(cid:12) since otherwise
the ﬂux at 100 µm would exceed 0.6 Jy. On the other hand,
according to Dwek & Arendt (2015) the observed ﬂux at
100 µm is exactly what it should be if there were 0.447 M(cid:12)
of dust at 615 days. At late times (9090 days) the ejecta
is optically thin to dust thermal emission and so the dust

8 Matsuura et al. (2011) and Matsuura et al. (2015) estimated
the dust mass at ∼ 9000 days with various assumptions about
composition and size and inferred a mass of ∼ 0.5 M(cid:12), in general
agreement with the other observational estimates.

mass is (relatively) straightforward to determine from far-IR
Herschel and sub-mm ALMA observations.

At the time of writing the discrepancy in dust mass
inferred at early times by diﬀerent groups is unresolved,
and it seems that more realistic radiative transfer model-
ing is required to settle the matter of the early dust mass
in SN 1987A. Most authors assume that the grains are a
mixture of carbon, iron, and enstatite (or other silicates),
but our calculations suggest that at 615 days most of the
dust mass is in magnesia, forsterite, silicon, and iron sulﬁde.
Most groups also assume that the size distribution scales as
dN/da ∝ a−3.5, but we ﬁnd that each grain species has its
own size distribution and that the total grain size is steeper
dN/da ∝ a−4.39. Most groups assume that all grains are in
dense clumps (what we would call dense shells), but we ﬁnd
that at 615 days the unclumped ambient ejecta contains
27% of the dust mass. Radiative transfer should further take
into account the very low density cavities of the fossil nickel
bubbles and consider the possibility that dust rich clumps
occupy much less volume than currently assumed.

We ﬁnally note that magnesia has not been detected in
SN 1987A, nor has it been detected in the observations of
other supernovae. We speculate that the high abundance of
MgO in our simulations is an artifact of not allowing MgO
monomers and clusters to merge with other grain species.
As is evident in Figure 11, where MgO forms in signiﬁcant
amounts, forsterite is also plentiful. It could be that in real-
ity, the MgO monomers and clusters that form are aways
absorbed into forsterite grains and do not exist as MgO
monomers and grains. If this hypothesis is true, it explains
the absence of detection of MgO in existing observations and
also diminishes the promise of detection of MgO in future
observations.

7.3 Future directions

Many aspects of our model of dust formation in supernova
could be improved and made more realistic. We brieﬂy men-
tion a few. The degradation of the energy released by de-
caying radioactive nuclei, starting with γ-rays, should be
followed with a Monte Carlo simulation (see, e.g., Hunger-
ford 2004; Jerkstrand et al. 2011). Such a simulation would
provide the local, time-dependent gas temperature and ion-
ization fraction in the ejecta as a function of time and an ac-
curate model for the UV radiation ﬁeld SED. These simula-
tions need to take into account the asymmetric distribution
of radioactive material, such as from the three-dimensional,
neutrino-driven core-collapse simulation of Wongwathanarat
et al. (2017) modeling Cas A. In post-processing they com-
puted the local 44Ti and 56Ni yield in the ejecta ﬁnding that
the 44Ti distribution was very asymmetrical, with the bulk
of isotope ejected into the hemisphere opposite to the neu-
tron star kick.

Grain temperature can ﬂuctuate stochastically, which,
owing to the exponential dependence of the evaporation rate
on temperature, has been found to inﬂuence grain growth in
AGB stellar outﬂows (Kochanek 2014). Compton-electron-
induced destruction reactions should be included for all
atoms, molecules, and dust grains. Ionization and molec-
ular dissociation by UV photons should also be included.
The destructive reactions with He+, Ne+, and Ar+ should be
included for all neutral molecules. Grain-species-speciﬁc ab-

32

A. Sluder et al.

sorption coeﬃcients and photoelectric yields should be used
in the place of our carbon grain-based model.

Perhaps more consequentially, we do not expect that
the dust grains have spherical shapes (Fallest et al. 2011).
They could have porous and even fractal-like structures. The
shape complexity could imply some very diﬀerent thermody-
namic, chemical, and optical behavior (e.g., Keith & Lazzati
2011). While a fully realistic treatment of grain shapes will
remain beyond reach, the salient eﬀects of shape complex-
ity should be assessed and incorporated in dust synthesis
models. We also note that many of the chemical reaction
rates used in this and preceding investigations of astrophys-
ical dust synthesis are unveriﬁed extrapolations of sparsely-
cataloged laboratory measurements. With the rapid devel-
opment of ab initio electronic structure methods, it is now
becoming possible to complement laboratory data with the-
oretical calculations. For example, Mauney et al. (2015) re-
cently reported density function theory (DFT) based calcu-
lations of the work of small carbon cluster formation and the
nucleation rate in a saturated, hydrogen-poor carbon gas.
The new quantum electrodynamical time-dependent DFT
(Flick et al. 2015) should enable direct computation of col-
lisional cross sections involving photon emission, such as for
radiative association in the formation small grain-precursor
atomic clusters.

The dust produced in our calculation must pass a re-
verse shock before joining the ISM. Sputtering in the re-
verse shock destroys small grains and reduces the large ones.
Therefore, dust survival hinges on the grain size distribu-
tion (e.g., Bianchi et al. 2009). This eﬀect can be studied in
Cassiopeia A where the reverse shock has already crossed a
fraction of the dust-forming ejecta (Nozawa et al. 2010). The
characteristic minimum size for a grain to survive the reverse
shock may be ∼ 0.1 µm (Silvia et al. 2010, 2012). Our cal-
culation produces an abundance of such large grains. Since
the reverse shock diminishes in clumps, our hypothesized
ejecta clumpiness, in the form of thin shells compressed by
overpressured nickel bubbles, serves to protect the grains in
clumps from the reverse shock (Biscaro & Cherchneﬀ 2016).

8 CONCLUSIONS

We simulated the formation molecules and dust grains in the
ejecta of SN 1987A using an improved molecular nucleation
theory model. The model assumes that 56Ni-rich clumps are
injected into the helium core where they expand and sweep
up dense shells of ambient ejecta. We compute the abun-
dance of molecules as a function of time using a nonequi-
librium chemical reaction network including the eﬀects of
radioactive decay of 56Ni, 57Ni, 44Ti, and 22Na. Grain forma-
tion starts with the formation of condensation nuclei which
are treated as molecular species in the chemical network.
The nuclei grow into grains via accretion and coagulation.
Grain charge and van der Waals interaction are explicitly
calculated to correct the coagulation rate. Grain destruction
by oxygen and noble gas weathering is included, as is evap-
oration. To get the evaporation rate, we explicitly compute
the grain temperature as a function of radius and account
for the ﬁnite grain size.

The model produces a total dust mass of 0.51 M(cid:12), which
is 16% of the mass of refractory elements. Grain formation

is rapid between 200 and 600 days and slower thereafter. At
615 days, our computed total grain mass agrees with the ob-
servational estimate of Dwek & Arendt (2015) but not with
those of Wesson et al. (2015) and Bevan & Barlow (2016).
We ﬁnd that the dust mass produced in the dense shells
scales as the 0.26 power of the mass density in the shells.
The ﬁnal computed dust mass is close to, and bracketed
by, the observationally inferred dust masses in SN 1987A.
The mass distribution dMdust/d ln a peaks at the grain radius
a = 680 ˚A. Beyond this peak, the size distribution scales as
dN/d ln a ∝ a−3.4, and the overall distribution is skewed to-
ward larger grains. The most common grain species by mass
are magnesia (32%), silicon (29%), forsterite (18%), iron sul-
ﬁde (7.8%), and carbon (6.1%). The dense shells produced
more dust mass and a greater variety of grain species than
the ambient ejecta whereas grain formation in the nickel
bubbles was negligible.

Finally, we note the numerical complexity of dust syn-
thesis calculations. To validate calculations such as ours, it is
necessary to run diﬀerent codes on the same or similar mod-
els and compare the results. We are encouraged that dust
composition and the timing of dust growth closely resemble
those in Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2015).

9 APPENDIX

In this Appendix we provide our isotope to element conversion
table (Table 12) and tables of chemical reactions included in our
model as well as some additional reactions (the remaining tables).
The additional reactions not included in our chemical network are
those involving nitrogen, charged molecules with three or more
atoms, and the molecules CS, CSO, C2O, CO2, SO2, S2, SiS, and
their charged counterparts. We provide these reactions for the
convenience of the reader who wishes to use a more comprehensive
reaction network.

The reaction source references indicated with acronyms are
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
(UMIST) Database for Astrochemistry
(U12; McElroy et al. 2013; http://udfa.ajmarkwick.net/) and Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemical
Kinetics Database
(http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/KineticsSearchForm.jsp).

In the reaction tables the last column is the reference that de-
scribes how we obtained the rate coeﬃcient. If a paper or database
is cited in the column, we either use the rate coeﬃcient cited in
the source or estimate it from information in the source. If a re-
action has a reference with the statement “= X”, then its rate
coeﬃcient could not be found in the literature and is duplicated
from a similar reaction X. Reactions with reference “O” use the
rate coeﬃcient for Cn + O → Cn−1 + CO from Lazzati & Heger
(2016) while reactions with reference “He+” use the rate coeﬃcient
for Cn + He+ → Cn−1 + C+ + He, from the same reference. Reac-
tions with reference “Est” used the formulas in Section 3.2. All
three-body reactions use the same rate coeﬃcient derived in that
section, even if they have rate coeﬃcients given in the literature,
because the published rates are only valid at high temperatures.
