ABSTRACT

Context. We are concerned with improving the diagnostic potential of the K lines and edges of elements with low cosmic abundances,
namely F, Na, P, Cl, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn, that are observed in the X-ray spectra of supernova remnants, galaxy
clusters and accreting black holes and neutron stars.
Aims.Since accurate photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections are needed in their spectral models, they have been computed
for isoelectronic sequences with electron number 12 ≤ N ≤ 18 using a multi-channel method.
Methods. Target representations are obtained with the atomic structure code autostructure, and ground-state cross sections are
computed with the Breit–Pauli R-matrix method (bprm) in intermediate coupling, including damping (radiative and Auger) eﬀects.
Results. Following the ﬁndings in our earlier work on sequences with 2 ≤ N ≤ 11, the contributions from channels associated
with the 2s-hole [2s]µ target conﬁgurations and those containing 3d orbitals are studied in the Mg (N = 12) and Ar (N = 18)
isoelectronic sequences. Cross sections for the latter ions are also calculated in the isolated-resonance approximation as implemented
in autostructure and compared with bprm to test their accuracy.
Conclusions. It is conﬁrmed that the collisional channels associated with the [2s]µ target conﬁgurations must be taken into account
owing to signiﬁcant increases in the monotonic background cross section between the L and K edges. Target conﬁgurations with
3d orbitals give rise to fairly conspicuous unresolved transition arrays in the L-edge region, but to a much lesser extent in the K-
edge which is our main concern; therefore, they have been neglected throughout owing to their computationally intractable channel
inventory, thus allowing the computation of cross sections for all the ions with 12 ≤ N ≤ 18 in intermediate coupling with bprm. We
ﬁnd that the isolated-resonance approximations performs satisfactorily and will be our best choice to tackle the systems with ground
conﬁguration 3p63dm (3 ≤ m ≤ 8) in isoelectronic sequences with N > 20.

1. Introduction

K lines and edges from elements with low cosmic abundance
(trace elements) have been observed with the Chandra, XMM-
Newton and Suzaku space telescopes in the X-ray spectra of
supernova remnants, galaxy clusters, and accreting black holes
and neutron stars. They have been used to constrain the ioniza-
tion, metallicity, abundances, black-hole progenitor mass, and,
in the case of warm absorbers, the ﬂow properties (see, for
instance, Hwang et al. 2000; Miller et al. 2006; Badenes et al.
2008; Kallman et al. 2009; Tamura et al. 2009; Ueda et al. 2009;
Nobukawa et al. 2010; Park et al. 2013). Their diagnostic poten-
tial was set to become exploited with the launching last Febru-
ary 2016 of the Hitomi spatial telescope (previously referred to
as Astro-H), an instrument of remarkable spectroscopic capabil-
ities. In spite of its becoming inoperative soon after, there is cur-
rently a deﬁnite intention to replace it by 2020; therefore, the
continuity of support projects, such as the present one to com-

pute the atomic data required in specialised spectral modeling, is
still arguable.

We have been involved for some time in the computation
of atomic data to enable the reliable modeling of the trace-
element K lines. Palmeri et al. (2012), to be referred to hereafter
as PQM12, computed with hfr (a Hartree–Fock code with rela-
tivistic corrections by Cowan 1981) level energies, radiative and
Auger widths, and ﬂuorescence yields for K-vacancy levels of
the complete isonuclear sequences of F, Na, P, Cl, K, Sc, Ti, V,
Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn. Using the atomic target models de-
veloped therein, Palmeri et al. (2016) (Paper 1 hereafter) calcu-
lated photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections of the
ground state of ionic systems with electron number N ≤ 11. In
this report, we extend this work to the third-row isoelectronic se-
quences (12 ≤ N ≤ 18) which, owing to the atomic complexity
brought about by the open 3p subshell, implies a diﬀerent com-
putational strategy.

Cross sections for the ﬁne-structure ground levels of the
second-row ions (N ≤ 10) were computed in Paper 1 in the

close-coupling framework with the Breit–Pauli R-matrix method
(bprm, Berrington et al. 1995), which enabled the rendering of
the resonance structures of the open L shell and K ionization
edge. Radiation and spectator-Auger damping that causes K-
edge smearing was taken into account (Palmeri et al. 2002). The
Na-like ions (N = 11), in particular P v and Zn xx, were then
used as test cases to extend this approach to the more complex
members of the third row with 12 ≤ N ≤ 18. For instance,
since the inclusion of target conﬁgurations with 3d orbitals dra-
matically increases the collisional channel inventory, particularly
when the 3p subshell is half ﬁlled, R-matrix calculations would
then have to be performed in LS coupling rather than in inter-
mediate coupling or, alternatively, be replaced by the uncou-
pled isolated-resonance approximation (Abdel-Naby et al. 2012)
of the atomic structure code autostructure (Eissner et al. 1974;
Badnell 2011). We found in Paper 1 that 3d resonances were
mainly conspicuous in the L edge rather than the K edge, the
latter being our main concern and, therefore, they could be prac-
tically neglected in spite of the ever-present n = 3 conﬁguration-
interaction (CI) eﬀects.

These computational tradeoﬀs are examined in greater depth
in this work, speciﬁcally for the simpler isoelectronic sequences
with N = 12 and N = 18, in an attempt to maintain the inter-
mediate coupling scheme for all the ionic systems of interest.
A brief description of the numerical methods is given in Sect. 2
and the results of the target-representation investigations and ﬁ-
nal calculations are discussed in Sect. 3. Conclusions are drawn
in Sect. 4, together with some guidelines for the future consider-
ation of the fourth-row ions.

2. Numerical methods

This project intends to compute photoabsorption and total and
partial photoionization cross sections for ionic species of the
isonuclear series P, Cl, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn with
electron numbers N < Z − 1, where Z is the atomic number iden-
tifying the sequence. Cross sections for isoelectronic sequences
with N ≤ 11 were reported in Paper 1, and here we discuss the
details of those with 12 ≤ N ≤ 18. As previously mentioned in
Paper 1, species with Z − 1 ≤ N ≤ Z will be treated elsewhere.

The close-coupling framework of scattering theory is the
main quantum-mechanical backbone, where the wave function
of the total N-electron system is expanded in terms of the eigen-
functions of an (N − 1)-electron target. Calculations are per-
formed in intermediate coupling with the relativistic (Breit–
Pauli) bprm method, where conﬁguration space is partitioned
by a sphere of radius r = a into two regions: an inner region
(r ≤ a) treated with the rmatrx1 package that takes into ac-
count exchange and correlation eﬀects between the target and
the active electron; and an asymptotic region (r > a) where
these eﬀects may be neglected and the active electron is sub-
ject to long-range multipole potentials. This external region is
solved with the stgbf0damp7 code that also includes radiation
and spectator-Auger damping by means of a model potential
(Robicheaux et al. 1995; Gorczyca & Badnell 1996, 2000). For
comparison purposes, particularly for the large target represen-
tations, the R-matrix package is also run in the more concise LS
coupling scheme.

Adopting the target representations listed in Table 9 of
PQM12 – namely conﬁguration expansions, level energies, and
Auger widths – orbitals are generated in a Thomas–Fermi–
Dirac statistical potential with the autostructure atomic struc-
ture code (Eissner et al. 1974; Badnell 2011). Cross sections in
the isolated-resonance approximation are also obtained with this

code. We note that, due to the complexity of third-row ions, the
target representations of PQM12 do not list the levels that arise
from a large number of n = 3 correlation conﬁgurations that
were taken into account to obtain reasonably accurate level en-
ergies and a level order similar to the spectroscopic.

3. Results

Cross sections are calculated right from threshold up to the
monotonic decreasing tail beyond the K edge. Although our
main interest is the K-edge structure, an eﬀort is also made to
resolve the resonances associated with the n = 3 valence shell
and the L edge. In the resonance regions, a ﬁne mesh step of
E/z2 = 0.0001 Ryd is used where z = Z − N + 1.

Following the ﬁndings of Paper 1, we analyse some of the
problems discussed therein, in particular the contributions from
[2s]µ target conﬁgurations and those from missing n = 3 con-
ﬁgurations (mainly those with 3d orbitals) in both the K- and
L-edge regions using ions of the Mg (N = 12) and Ar (N = 18)
isoelectronic sequences.

3.1. [2s]µ target conﬁgurations

In Paper 1 we ﬁnd that, in the case of the Na-like sequence
(N = 11), the corresponding Ne-like target models in PQM12
comprised the following conﬁgurations: 2p6, [2p]3s, [2p]3p,
[1s]3s, and [1s]3p, but neglected [2s]3s and [2s]3p. If the latter
two are not taken into account in the close-coupling expansion,
some resonances (mostly narrow) in the L-edge region would be
missing, but more importantly, the background cross section be-
tween the L and K edges is signiﬁcantly underestimated. This
eﬀect is further examined here in Mg-like P iv and Ar-like Sc iv
by using the following target representations:
Target A – As listed in Table 9 of PQM12, the Na-like P v target
is represented with the conﬁgurations 2p63s, 2p63p, [2p]3s2,
[2p]3s3p, [1s]3s2 and [1s]3s3p;

Target B – The P v target includes the conﬁgurations of Tar-

get A plus [2s]3s2 and [2s]3s3p;

Target C – As listed in Table 9 of PQM12, the Cl-like Sc v
target is represented with the conﬁgurations 3p5, [3s]3p6,
[2p]3p6 and [1s]3p6;

Target D – Sc v target includes the conﬁgurations of Target C

plus [2s]3p6.
In Fig. 1 the photoabsorption cross sections of P iv and Sc iv
ions are plotted in both the L- and K-edge regions, where the un-
derestimated background cross sections caused by the exclusion
of channels associated to the [2s]µ target conﬁgurations can be
seen. Although the K edge is hardly altered, when these conﬁg-
urations are taken into account, additional unresolved transition
arrays (UTAs) appear (∼ 16.5 Ryd for P iv and ∼ 38.5 Ryd in
Sc iv) in the L-edge region.

In the case of P iv, the L edge is ampliﬁed in Fig. 2a
where, to estimate the variations of the UTA morphology, the
cross sections have been convolved with a Gaussian of width
∆E/E = 0.01. We see that, apart from the extra features emerg-
ing when using Target B in the 14–17 Ryd energy interval, the
resonance structure is also somewhat perturbed around the edge
head (∼ 13 Ryd).

3.2. Missing n = 3 conﬁgurations

is the large number of n = 3 closely coupled states to be consid-
ered from conﬁgurations of the type 3sx3py3dz. If electron pro-
motions from the K and L shells are additionally involved, such
as in this work, then the channel inventory in the close-coupling
expansion rapidly becomes computationally intractable; there-
fore, compromises are unavoidable in spite of the ensuing CI
shortcomings. For instance, in the Na-like targets (N = 11) of
PQM12, conﬁgurations of the type [1s]3p2 and [2p]3p2 were
neither listed, nor those containing 3d orbitals for all the systems
with N ≤ 18.

To study the impact of these exclusions on the edge-region

cross sections, three targets are considered:

Target E – Na-like P v target is represented with conﬁgurations

of Target B plus [2p]3p2, [2s]3p2 and [1s]3p2;

Target F – P v target includes the conﬁgurations of Target E
plus 2p63d, [2p]3s3d, [2p]3p3d, [2p]3d2, [2s]3s3d, [2s]3p3d,
[2s]3d2, [1s]3s3d, [1s]3p3d and [1s]3d2;

Target B comprises 39 ﬁne-structure levels, an inventory that is
almost doubled in Target E to 76 levels while Target F gives
rise to 305. This sharp level increase, when only single-electron
promotions are considered, supports our previous comments on
computationally unmanageable atomic models, even for the rela-
tively simple Na- and Cl-like targets. A similar situation is found
for the latter, where Target D encompasses 72 levels in compar-
ison with 208 in Target G.

Photoabsorption cross sections for Mg-like P iv in the K-
edge region computed with Target B and Target E are very sim-
ilar but, as shown in Fig. 2b, the UTAs in the edge head at 13–
14 Ryd show diﬀerent morphologies. These behavioral patterns
are maintained in comparisons between the cross sections com-
puted with Target E and Target F (Fig. 3) and, in the case of Ar-
like Sc iv, between Target D and Target G (Fig. 4). Owing to the
large number of collisional channels, cross sections in Figs. 3–
4 have been computed in LS coupling; thus, a comparison be-
tween the black curves in Fig. 2b and Fig. 3a gives a measure
of the small but distinguishable resonance-structure diﬀerences
resulting from the LS - and intermediate-coupling frameworks.

3.3. Isolated-resonance approximation

A comparison is depicted in Fig. 5 between the photoabsorption
cross sections of Sc iv in the K- and L-edge regions computed in
intermediate coupling with bprm and, in the isolated resonance
approximation, with autostructure, where it may be seen that
the latter performs surprisingly well in spite of the neglect of
channel coupling and the adoption of symmetric Lorentzian res-
onance proﬁles. In this plot, a small energy shift was performed
to match the resonance series, which is due to diﬀerences in the
bprm and autostructure ionization potentials. Moreover, a com-
parison of the [1s]np 1Po K resonance position in Fig. 4b and
Fig. 5b reveals a 1.5 Ryd discrepancy that is caused by the rel-
ativistic contribution since the former was obtained in LS cou-
pling. This discrepancy can be reduced by running bprm in LS

to ﬁne structure; i.e. the mass-correction and Darwin one-body
terms.

3.4. Sequences with 13 ≤ N ≤ 17

Taking into account the ﬁndings that emerged from the diﬀerent
target representations considered for the Mg- and Ar-like iso-
electronic sequences in Sects. 3.1–3.2, we proceeded to com-
pute with bprm cross sections for the other more computation-
ally involved sequences, namely those with electron number
13 ≤ N ≤ 17. We adopted the target models of PQM12, but
additionally included the [2s]µ conﬁgurations that, as shown in
Fig. 1, aﬀect the background photoabsorption cross sections be-
tween the L and K edges. Conﬁgurations including 3d orbitals
were thus excluded leading to underrepresented L edges (see
Figs. 3–4).

Article number, page 4 of 5

As an example, photoabsorption cross sections in the K- and
L-edge regions for Zn ions with electron number 14 ≤ N ≤ 17
are plotted in Fig. 6, showing contrasting edge resonance struc-
tures. The K edge is dominated by well-deﬁned resonance se-
ries (K lines) whose broad and practically constant widths are
regulated by damping (radiative and spectator-electron Auger);
they thus lead to smeared edges in the photon energy band 745–
765 Ryd. The sharp L edges in the energy band 110–130 Ryd are
populated by a very large number of narrow resonances where
the 2 → 3 and 2 → 4 UTAs at ∼ 85 Ryd and ∼ 100 Ryd, respec-
tively, can be distinguished. Less pronounced UTAs between 38
and 55 Ryd due to valence resonances may also be appreciated.
From the astronomical diagnostic point of view, Fig. 6 ap-
pears to indicate that the Kα, Kβ, and K edge will give rise to
resolvable spectral signatures with information about the plasma
ionization state, while L edge dominated by several UTAs will
be messy and thus less astrophysically useful; in fact, in such
spectral ranges K lines from the lower-Z species are the features
to single out.

4. Conclusions

1. Photoabsorption and photoionization (total and partial) cross
sections for the ions of P, Cl, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu,
and Zn with electron numbers 12 ≤ N ≤ 18 have been com-
puted with the Breit–Pauli R-matrix method (bprm) in inter-
mediate coupling. Both the L and K resonance structures are
well resolved with ﬁne energy meshes. Damping eﬀects have
been shown to be relevant in the K-edge resonance struc-
tures.

2. Regarding the importance of 2s promotion discussed in Pa-
per 1, it is reaﬃrmed that, for third-row ions, this must be
taken into account with conﬁgurations of the type [2s]µ oth-
erwise the background cross sections between the K and L
edges are underestimated.

3. We have excluded target conﬁgurations with 3d orbitals, thus
enabling the computations of cross sections in intermediate
coupling with bprm that adopt the ion models of PQM12
for isoelectronic sequences with 13 ≤ N ≤ 17. As shown
in Sect. 3.2, the L edge will be somewhat aﬀected, but a
more realistic representation of its intricate resonance se-
ries would require more sophisticated target models and a
computational eﬀort beyond the scope of this project that
is mainly focused on the K-edge structures. For tractable
target-model management, we have only considered single
excitations within the n = 3 complex that certainly lead
to unconverged CI expansions, in particular in the valence
electron shell. In Paper 1, the possibility of rendering the K
and L edges in separate calculations was mentioned, but this
scheme was dropped since it would have made the determi-
nation of partial photoionization cross section, which are re-
quired in the atomic database of the xstar spectral modeling
code (Bautista & Kallman 2001; Kallman & Bautista 2001),
very cumbersome.

4. For ions with N = 18, namely Sc iv, we have made com-
parisons of the present bprm photoabsorption cross sections
with those computed in the isolated-resonance approxima-
tion with the autostructure code. This is an important step
since cross sections for most of the lowly ionized species
with electron number N > 20 and ground conﬁgurations
3p63dm with 3 ≤ m ≤ 8 will not be calculated with bprm
owing to target size. In this respect, it has been shown that,
in spite of the shortcomings of the isolated-resonance ap-
proximation, i.e. neglected channel-coupling and symmetric

5. When cross sections are computed with bprm in LS cou-
pling, it is emphasized that the relativistic one-body, non-
ﬁne-structure corrections must be taken into account other-
wise poor energy resonance positions, in particular those as-
sociated with the K edge, will be obtained.

tion previous long-term arrangements with this data center,
which have led to sustainable and eﬃcient data services, e.g.

be uploaded with the upcoming Paper 3 of the present se-
ries, and the corresponding links will be provided through
the ADS.
