The sheet resistance Rs of Ar+ irradiated SrTiO3 in patterns with a length scale of several microns 
increases significantly below ~40 K in connection with driving currents exceeding a certain threshold. 
The  initial  lower  Rs  is  recovered  upon  warming  with  accelerated  recovery  around  70  and  160  K. 
Scanning  SQUID  microscopy  shows  local  irreversible  changes  in  the  spatial  distribution  of  the 
current with a length scale of several microns.  We attribute the observed non-uniform enhancement 
of Rs to the attraction of the charged single- and di- oxygen vacancies by the crystallographic domain 
boundaries in SrTiO3. The boundaries which are nearly ferroelectric below 40 K are polarized by the 
local electrical field associated with the driven current and the clustered vacancies which suppress 
conductivity in their vicinity yield a noticeable enhancement in the device resistance when the current 
path width is on the order of the boundary extension. The temperatures of accelerated conductivity 
recovery are associated with the energy barriers for the diffusion of the two types of vacancies.

INTRODUCTION 

 Perovskites  attract  tremendous  interest  for  their  wide  range  of  intriguing  properties  including 

magnetism,  high  Tc  superconductivity  and  multiferroicity  [1].  Special  attention  is  paid  to 

heterostructures consisting of SrTiO3 (STO) which is expected to play a central role in oxide based 

electronics. Of particular interest are quasi- 2D conducting states emerging at the interface between 

SrTiO3  and  different  transition  metal  oxides  [2-5]  including  LaAlO3/SrTiO3  (LAO/STO).  As  the 

emerging  phenomena  in  these  heterostructures  are  commonly  attributed  to  the  modified  SrTiO3 

states,  it  is  important  to  explore  properties  of  conducting  layers  in  STO  surfaces  modified  by 

irradiation or gating. [6-8] 

The stoichiometric bulk STO is a nonpolar cubic band insulator with a band gap of ~ 3.2 eV. 

However, upon different treatments high mobility conductivity may be obtained [8]. A common way 

to make STO conducting is through electron doping realized by introducing oxygen vacancies. When 

such  vacancies  form  through  high  temperature  annealing  in  vacuum  [9-12]  bulk  conductivity  is 

obtained. On the other hand, when the oxygen vacancies are introduced by Ar+ irradiation [8] a quasi-

2D conducting  layer  forms  close to the surface. Similarly,  bulk or surface doping  of STO with Nb 

yields bulk or quasi-2D conductivity, respectively [13,14] . Another route to conductivity is electronic 

reconstruction at the interface between several layers of LaAlO3 [1] deposited on STO which leads to 

the formation of a two-dimensional conducting layer. In addition, STO can be doped electrostatically 

[15,16]  using  electric  double  layer  transistor  (EDLT)  [17]  configuration  employing  a  polymer 

electrolyte [10] thus making STO conducting.  

Here we report current-induced sheet resistance (Rs) increase in patterned STO samples with a 

length scale of several microns. This phenomenon occurs below ~40 K in connection with driving an 

electrical current through the sample exceeding a certain threshold. The initial as-cooled Rs recovers 

upon  warming,  particularly  around  70  and  160  K,  similar  to  the  behavior  exhibited  by  LAO/STO 

system  [18,19]  .  To  probe  the  microscopic  manifestation  of  the  effect  we  have  used  a  scanning 

2 

 
 
 
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and observed spatial changes in magnetic flux 

pattern prior to and after the Rs increase. The emerging scenario attributes the effect to two factors: 

crystallographic domain boundaries in STO which exhibit ferroelectric instability  below ~40 K and 

charged single- and di- oxygen vacancies which become mobile at around 70 and 160 K, respectively.  

Below ~40 K the local electric field associated with current exceeding a certain threshold  is capable 

of  polarizing  the  crystallographic  domain  boundaries  in  STO.  The  polarized  boundaries  attract  the 

charged oxygen vacancies and cause their clustering. For current path widths on the order of several 

microns  which  is  similar  to  the  extension  of  the  boundaries  such  a  clustering  yields  a  noticeable 

decrease in conductivity, as such vacancies locally suppress electrical conductivity. Upon warming, 

the boundaries lose their polarization at ~40 K; however, the clusters of the oxygen vacancies disperse 

only  at  higher  temperatures  at  which  the  vacancies  become  mobile.  We  believe  that  the  emerging 

scenario is relevant to the understanding of the physics of other quasi 2D electron gas formed on STO 

substrate which makes our results particularly important for future development of novel STO-based 

devices.  

II.  EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 

Our  samples  are  commercially  available  two  sided  polished  STO  crystals.  The  substrates  are 

selectively irradiated to define conducting areas in patterns that allow resistivity measurements with 

current  path  width  that  vary  between  2 to  20 μm  (see  a typical  pattern  geometry  in  Figure  1). The 

selective irradiation is obtained by covering the entire sample with a resist and removing it in specific 

places by using e-beam lithography. The e-beam resist used for patterning has a thickness of 1.5 µm. 

The thickness of the e-beam resist was chosen such that it survives the irradiation due to Ar+ beam. 

For irradiation we use an Ar+ beam with a fluence of 1015 ions /s cm2 accelerated by 4 KeV for 100 

seconds. The estimated penetration depth “L” in Angstrom was calculated using the empirical formula 

[8] L = 1.1 × E

target in amu, ρ is the target density, and Zi and Zt are the atomic numbers of the ions and the targets 

respectively. The calculated penetration depth was found to be ~ 120Å.

 The reported effect was studied using transport measurements carried out in Quantum Design PPMS-

9. In addition, we have used a scanning SQUID probe to explore the microscopic manifestation of the 

effect. 

III.  RESULTS 

Figure 1 presents a typical current-induced increase of Rs at 5 K in irradiated STO.  Data are shown 

for patterns with channel width of 2, 5, and 8 μm. The  initial Rs of the patterns  is  measured with a 

small  probing  current of  0.04  μA.  Subsequently,  the  driving  current  is  increased  in  steps  and  Rs  is 

measured for different current values. After each current step, Rs is measured with a probing current 

value of 0.04 μA to obtain the sheet resistance while excluding Joule heating effects (The “oscillations" 

in Rs seen in Figure 1(d) are related to joule heating when a high current is driven through the sample). 

Whereas a spontaneous small increase in Rs is occasionally observed at low driving currents and also 

when  probing  current  is  used.  A  larger  increase  is  observed  consistently  above  a  certain  current 

threshold of ~ 0.3 μA without a clear dependence on the channel width, as might be expected. On the 

other hand, the magnitude of the effect (the current induced increase of Rs) strongly decreases with the 

increase of the channel width. In order to quantify the relative increase in Rs due to driven current we 

have calculated (Rs

after trapping − Rs

before trapping)/Rs

before trapping  in percentage. Figure 1(e) depicts 

the variation of Rs

after trap − Rs

before trap)/Rs

before trap with the sample channel width at 5K. It is found 

that this parameter strongly depends on the channel width and it becomes negligible when the channel 

width becomes more than ~ 10 microns.    

The  initial  lower  Rs  is  recovered  upon  warming.  Figure  2(a)  shows  Rs  during  cooling  from 

room temperature down to 5 K and during warming after current-induced Rs increase at 5 K in a pattern 

with a channel width of 5 μm. The inset of Figure 2(a) exhibits the increase in Rs due to trapping.  We 

observe that the conductivity recovery is accelerated around 70 and 160 K as depicted in Figure 2(b). 

In order to understand the reproducibility of the accelerated recovery temperature, a graph in the inset 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
of Figure 2(b) depicts the similar effect as presented in Figure 2(b) for the two others samples. This 

denote the reproducibility of the transition occurring at 70K and 160K. The temperature dependence 

of the effect is demonstrated in Figure 3. In this figure, the sample is cooled  with different applied 

currents.  When  the  applied  current  is  larger  than  the  threshold  current  required  for  resistivity 

increase, the upturn in the resistance can be seen. We note a clear split between the curves below a 

threshold temperature of ~40 K and it grows continuously as the temperature is decreased. 

To explore the  microscopic  manifestation of the effect, we have used a scanning SQUID to 

probe the current flow distribution in a pattern with a channel width of 20 μm before and after a current-

induced increase of Rs. During measurement an AC bias current (821 Hz) with a varying magnitude 

was driven through the sample. The generated magnetic flux was measured by the SQUID at different 

positions  in  the  sample  through  a  1.8  μm  pick  up  loop  using  lock  in  techniques.  All  the  SQUID 

measurements presented in this manuscript are performed at 4.2K. The resultant SQUID image is a 

convolution  of  the  z  component  of  the  magnetic  field  and  the  SQUID  point  spread  function.  The 

SQUID response was found to be linear with the applied current and independent of frequency. The 

choice of the pattern with channel width of  20 μm  is  based on the size of the pick-up  loop and the 

spatial resolution of our system. Prior to the measurement of scanning SQUID in this pattern, we have 

carried out the current-induced increase of Rs at 5 K. Current of magnitude 500 μA is found to induce 

charge trapping in this pattern.  

Figure  4(a)  shows  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  magnetic  flux  resulting  from  a  current  below  the 

threshold  value  flowing  in  the  pattern  after  the  initial  cool-down.  The  flux  structure  shows  an 

inhomogeneous  flow  of  current. To  understand  the  influence  of  the  microscopic  changes  on  to the 

charge trapping in STO, high resolution SQUID response was collected over a large area of the sample 

for different magnitudes of the driven current starting from 0.1 mA up to 4 mA. Figure 4(b) and (c) 

denote  the  spatial  distribution  of  magnetic  flux  for  different  current  magnitudes  at  two  separate 

locations on the studied pattern. It is evident from these figures that  spatial changes in the magnetic 

flux start to appear as shown in Figure 4(b) as soon as the driven current surpasses the threshold value. 

5 

 
 
Figure 4(c) exhibits no change in the modulation of the flux densities indicating that the phenomena 

could be related to the microscopic local domain configuration. In other areas of the sample we find 

traces  for  a  modulation  of  current  over  the  underlying  domain  structure,  buried  under  the  overall 

inhomogeneous current flow. In order to better visualize the spatial variation over which the changes 

are taking places, two-dimensional current density is depicted in Figure 4(d) –(e) (for the driven current 

starting from 0.1 mA up to 4 mA). To explore the changes in current distribution due to the studied 

effect, we use its relation to the measured magnetic flux distribution via Biot-Savart law assuming a 

two dimensional current flow [20]. Considering the Hall bar structure and the quasi 2D conductivity, 

we approximated the spatial distribution of the current density according to the method described by 

Roth  et  al  [20].  The  modulation  of  the  current  distribution  is  reconstructed  from  ac  flux  image  by 

employing Fourier transform and considering the geometry of the pickup coil. This is extracted from 

the flux image presented in Figure 4(b) and (c). The region over which the modulation in the current 

density  (for  a  driven  current)  is  observed,  is  estimated  to  be  ~4-5  µm.  The  figure  4(f)  shows  high 

resolution images of a selected region before applying a current of 0.5 mA. The flux structure reflects 

underlying tetragonal domain structure masked by the inhomogeneities in the current flow. All images 

and profiles are normalized by the applied current.  

IV. DISCUSSION 

In  this  study  we  show  current-induced  increase  of  Rs  in  irradiated  STO.  The  effect  becomes  most 

notable in patterns with a length scale below ~ 10 microns and it occurs below a threshold temperature 

of ~ 40 K for large enough applied currents. The initial Rs is recovered upon warming with notable 

accelerated recovery around 70 and 160 K. Scanning SQUID imaging reveals that the Rs enhancement 

is  nonuniform  and  correlated  with  local  changes  on  the  order  of  several  microns  in  the  current 

distribution (see Figure 4). The current density  changes (for a particular driven current through the 

sample) by a factor of two within a 20 µm channel and the region over which the modulation in the 

current density (for a particular driven current) is observed  is estimated to be ~4-5 µm.  The effect 

resembles current-induced increase of Rs is LAO/STO [18,19] heterostructure, where it is found that 

6 

 
 
the accelerated recovery  near 70 K and 160 K is associated with two well defined energy barriers Eb1 

= 0.224 ± 0.003 eV and Eb2 = 0.44 ± 0.015 eV [19].  Thus the observed phenomena in STO seems to 

be closely related to the charge trapping phenomena observed in LAO/STO. A picture emerges from 

the experimental data reported in this paper which plausibly accounts for the above facts. It includes 

charged  oxygen  vacancies  of  two  types  and  tetragonal  domain  walls  which  are  shown  to  affect 

electrical transport [21]. The upper bound of the domain wall width was estimated to be ~5 µm at 80 

K [22].  

        Single- and di- oxygen vacancies commonly occur in STO [23,24]. Their formation energies are 

lowest  on  the  surface  since  less  bonds  are  being  broken  when  a  defect  is  created  there.  Based  on 

experiments  and  DFT  calculations  it  was  concluded  that  these  defects  reside  preferentially  at 

dislocations and twins [25-27]. The latter, which have been imaged before [21,28, 29] , correspond to 

the boundaries between a-, b- and c- oriented crystallographic domains that form below the ferroelastic 

transition  from  cubic  to  tetragonal  symmetry  at  ~105  K,  driven  by  minute  rotation  of  the  TiO6 

octahedra [30]. It has been reported in the literature that these tetragonal twin domains strongly affect 

the  microscopic electronic properties  [21,31]. In the temperature range when  vacancies are  mobile, 

they  flow  along  nanoscale  filamentary  channels  and  motion  appears  correlated  within  bundles  of 

filaments of typical size 1 - 10 µm [25].   

          At low temperature, (single-, di-) vacancies cannot overcome the migration energy barrier and 

they form static clusters within the filament bundles. The values of these barriers at the surface, namely 

0.14 -0.2 eV and 0.4 eV for single- and di- vacancy motion respectively [24,32,33], closely match the 

trapping energies that were determined by Seri et al. [19] for LAO/STO and were shown to correspond 

to two recovery temperatures at 70 K and 160 K as is also observed in the present study. Since vacancy 

motions are correlated within a bundle, one expects only small variations in the value of the trapping 

current for sample widths less than 10 µm. Ab initio calculations show that one of the two electrons 

released  by  an  oxygen  vacancy  remains  in  the  vicinity  of  the  defect  while  the  other  becomes 

7 

 
 
 
delocalized and participates in the two dimensional electron liquid layer detected near the surface of 

STO.  

           A recent report by Ma et al., [28] furthermore reveals that beyond a certain threshold of electric 

field, ferroelectricity can be induced within the twin walls in STO. In the literature, the simultaneous 

occurrence of the twin domain wall mobility and of the local instabilities revealing the closeness to a 

ferroelectric transition is evidenced experimentally at temperature lower than 40 K [30,31].  

          We suggest that driving a current exceeding a certain threshold below 40 K polarizes the domain 

walls which increases the density of the charged oxygen vacancies in their vicinity.  The electric field 

generated  by  the  positive  charge  of  the  vacancy  leads  to  a  spatial  variation  of  the  ferroelectric 

polarization in the wall. This variation entails a larger value of the polar energy than that produced by 

a uniform polarization. In order to lower the energy, electrons from the 2DEG bind to the vacancies 

so as to screen their positive charge and cancel their electric field. This causes an increase in Rs. When 

oxygen vacancies and di-vacancies become mobile upon warming, i.e. above 70K and 160K, the initial 

higher conductivity is recovered. A schematic description of this scenario is presented in Figure 5.   

         In conclusion, we identify a low temperature Rs increase in connection with driving an electrical 

current higher than a certain threshold through the pattern. This effect is predominant below ~40 K 

and an accelerated recovery near 70 K and 160 K is observed while warming the sample. Microscopic 

SQUID imaging of the sample at lower temperature before and after the charge trapping reveals the 

change in the magnetic flux structure. The modulation of the current density prior to and after charge 

trapping reveals that the microscopic changes are taking place in the region of ~4-5 µm. We understand 

the observed phenomena by considering the tendency for domain wall polarization below 40 K, the 

interaction between charged oxygen vacancies and the domain walls, the internal gating effects, and 

the  energy  barriers  associated  with  the  mobility  of  the  two types  of  vacancies.    Understanding  the 

interplay  between  domain  walls  and  oxygen  vacancies  in  this  system  is  crucial  for  understanding 

electrical transport properties of this system and for designing future STO-based devices.

FIG  5:  (a)  Schematics  of  tetragonal  domains  in  SrTiO3  and  the  formation  of  twin 

boundaries  at the  intersection  of  three  possible  domains  with  different orientation.  (The 

domains are labelled as X, Y and Z according to their long axis).  During initial cool down 

from room temperature, oxygen vacancies of two types, single and di-vacancies become 

static  below  70  K  (single  vacancies)  and  160  K  (di-vacancies).   The  vacancies  have 

tendency to be close to the DWs and they have a small effect on the conductivity of the 

2DEG. (b) The electrical fields associated with currents above a certain threshold induce 

below 40 K a ferroelectric transition of the DWs. The polarization of the DWs increases 

the density of oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of the DWs. The associated electrical fields 

in the vicinity of the DWs act as internal gating which yields a noticeable decrease in the 

conductivity the 2DEG. Above 40 K and below 70 K the DWs are not polarized; however, 

the vacancies are still static and therefore the initially higher conductivity is not recovered. 

(c) Upon warming, above ~70 K the single oxygen vacancies become mobile which yields 

a partial conductivity recovery. (d) Upon further warming, above~ 160 K the oxygen di-

vacancies  become  mobile  which  yields  a  full  conductivity  recovery.  Notably  at  this
