ABSTRACT

We analyze long-cadence Kepler K2 observations of AR Sco from 2014, along with survey photometry
obtained between 2005 and 2016 by the Catalina Real-Time Sky Survey and the All-Sky Automated
Survey for Supernovae. The K2 data show the orbital modulation to have been fairly stable during
the 78 days of observations, but we detect aperiodic deviations from the average waveform with an
amplitude of ∼ 2% on a timescale of a few days. A comparison of the K2 data with the survey
photometry reveals that the orbital waveform gradually changed between 2005 and 2010, with the
orbital maximum shifting to earlier phases. We compare these photometric variations with proposed
models of this unusual system.

1. INTRODUCTION

AR Scorpii (AR Sco) is an unprecedented binary sys-
tem featuring a white dwarf (WD) that generates highly
periodic pulses across the electromagnetic spectrum ev-
ery 1.97 min, even at radio wavelengths (Marsh et al.
2016). The system’s total luminosity exceeds the com-
bined luminosity of the WD and its red dwarf companion
by an average factor of ∼4, and its spectral energy dis-
tribution is consistent with synchrotron radiation, with
the low X-ray luminosity implying minimal accretion
(Marsh et al. 2016).
Interpreting AR Sco as the ﬁrst
WD pulsar, Buckley et al. (2017) established that the
optical pulses are highly linearly polarized and argued
that the observed properties of AR Sco are consistent
with a strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating WD whose
spin-down powers the system’s luminosity. In this sce-
nario, the WD’s magnetic axis is nearly perpendicular
to its rotational axis, and the synchrotron radiation is
produced when the WD’s open ﬁeld lines sweep across
the secondary, accelerating electrons in its wind (Geng,
Zhang, & Huang 2016). High-angular-resolution inter-
ferometric observations have shown the radio-emitting
region to be smaller than ∼ 0.02 AU, implying the ab-
sence of a radio-bright outﬂow, such as a collimated jet
(Marcote et al. 2017).

As an alternative to the WD-pulsar model, Katz
(2017) proposed two hypotheses. In the ﬁrst, the WD’s
magnetic ﬁeld sweeps over the face of the secondary,

leading to the formation of a bow wave on the leading
face of the secondary. Magnetic dissipation occurs pref-
erentially in this bow wave, causing the observed orbital
maximum at φorb ∼ 0.4, where superior conjunction of
the secondary occurs at φorb = 0.5. In Katz’s alternative
hypothesis, the WD’s spin axis is misaligned with the bi-
nary’s orbital axis, and the WD’s magnetic moment is
inclined with respect to its spin axis. As a result, the
magnetic ﬁeld experienced by the secondary varies with
orbital phase, leading to a photometric modulation at
the orbital period. In this second hypothesis, the mis-
alignment causes a precession, and Katz predicts that
the phase of maximum light drifts on timescales of ∼20-
200 years. This provides an observational test between
the various models.

In the optical, the system exhibits two principal pe-
riodicities: a 3.56-hour orbital period, and the afore-
mentioned 1.97-min, double-peaked pulsation, the am-
plitude of which can be as large as ∼1.5 mag, corre-
sponding with the beat period between the WD spin
and binary orbital periods. Curiously, the peak of the
orbital modulation occurs at φorb ∼ 0.4 and is therefore
oﬀset from the time of superior conjunction at φorb =
0.5, the phase at which maximum light from the irradi-
ated inner hemisphere of the secondary would normally
be observed.

We analyze eleven years of survey photometry of AR
Sco, as well as Kepler K2 observations, to investigate

(P.I. Andrej Prsa) during Campaign 2 of the K2 mis-
sion between 23 Aug. 2014 and 10 Nov. 2014. Unfor-
tunately, the 30-minute cadence of the K2 data means
that the 1.97-min pulses are not temporally resolved,
but the data nevertheless provide a unique opportunity
to assess the stability of the orbital waveform across the
79-day K2 run.

To extract the photometry, we downloaded the pixel
ﬁle for AR Sco and performed aperture photometry on
AR Sco’s centroid in each image. All datapoints aﬀected
by thruster ﬁrings were removed. When phased to the
orbital ephemeris in Marsh et al. (2016), the K2 obser-
vations show the orbital modulation to be remarkably
consistent, with no obvious variations in the system’s
overall brightness (Figure 1, left panel). The phase plot
shows that the orbital modulation peaked near φorb ∼
0.4, as observed in Marsh et al. (2016). The rise to max-
imum is steeper than the decline to minimum, with the
latter showing a change in slope near φorb ∼ 0.7.

A power spectrum of the light curve (Figure 2) con-
tains the fundamental orbital frequency and its next two
harmonics. We did not search for frequencies above the
Nyquist frequency for the data. The orbital period in
the K2 data is 0.148533(7) d, consistent with the value
reported by Marsh et al. (2016). There is no evidence
of additional periodicities in the power spectrum.

Based on the phase plot, we computed a polynomial
that describes the orbital modulation as a function of
orbital phase. We used this polynomial to subtract the

ﬁtted to each bin by applying vertical and horizontal translations to minimize χ2. In the earliest CRTS bin, there is signiﬁcant
deviation from the K2 modulation, and the rising part of the light curve is fainter than in subsequent bins. The bright outliers
in the CRTS data are consistent with beat pulses. The “CV” bandpass denotes unﬁltered data with a V zeropoint. A bandpass

amplitude of the ASAS-SN orbital modulation.

subtle variations in the overall brightness, and we plot
these residuals in the right panel of Figure 1. There is
a signiﬁcant brightness variation approximately 15 days
into the K2 run, with an amplitude of 2%. Another
possible rise is seen at the end of the run. The origin
of these week-long brightness variations is unclear, but
we viewed the images from the pixel ﬁle to ensure that
they are not artifacts caused by the passage of asteroids
through the image.

2.2. CRTS and ASAS-SN photometry

The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the orbital mod-
ulation in the K2 data enables us to test whether it is
consistent with the orbital modulation in the Catalina
Real-Time Sky Survey (CRTS; Drake et. al. 2009) and
the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-
SN; Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017). To-
gether, the photometry from these two surveys provides
coverage of AR Sco from 2005-2016. Because of sparse
sampling, we divide the CRTS photometry into a trio of
three-year bins (2005-2007, 2008-2010, and 2011-2013)
and the ASAS-SN data into three one-year bins (2014,
2015, and 2016); in none of the bins were CRTS and
ASAS-SN data merged. We phased the data in each bin

and excludes them from the ﬁt.

using the ephemeris from Marsh et al. (2016) and then
ﬁt the average K2 waveform to each bin using χ2 mini-
mization to solve for two free parameters: a phase shift
and a magnitude oﬀset.

The resulting ﬁts are shown in Fig. 3. Although the
three CRTS-only bins generally agree with the K2 wave-
form, there is a striking trend: the shape of the rising
part of the light curve changes with time. In the earli-
est data (2005-2007), a number of observations between
0.2 < φorb < 0.4 are signiﬁcantly fainter than expected
from the K2 ﬁt, some by as much as a half-magnitude.
Although there are some points that are considerably
brighter than the K2 ﬁt, these observations were proba-
bly contaminated by beat pulses, during which AR Sco
can ﬂare by a factor of four in (cid:46) 30 seconds (Marsh et
al. 2016). In the next bin (2008-2010), the rising part
of the light curve is still fainter than the K2 ﬁt, but the
discrepancy is not as pronounced. Finally, the most re-
cent CRTS bin (2011-2013) shows excellent agreement
with the K2 light curve at all phases.

The K2 ﬁt to the ASAS-SN data underpredicts the
amplitude of the orbital variation, but this is likely the
result of a diﬀerence in bandpass. The Marsh et al.
(2016) spectrum shows a strong contribution from the
M-dwarf from ∼700-900 nm. While an unﬁltered CCD
is sensitive at these wavelengths, the V -band has negli-
gible transmission redward of 700 nm. As a result, the
contrast between the heated inner hemisphere and the
presumably unheated outer hemisphere will be greater
in the V -band ASAS-SN data than in the unﬁltered K2
and CRTS data, giving rise to a larger orbital modula-
tion at shorter wavelengths.

2.3. Phase of the Orbital Maximum

We ﬁt third-order polynomials to the orbital maxi-
mum in each of the bins to estimate the phase of max-
imum light. The initial ﬁts to the data used a con-
ventional least-squares-minimization approach, but the
quality of these ﬁts is adversely aﬀected a number of
bright outliers between orbital phases ∼0.1-0.4. Marsh
et al. (2016) showed that the amplitude of the beat pul-
sations is largest at these orbital phases, so observations
contaminated by beat pulses will drag the maximum of
a conventional least-squares polynomial towards earlier
phases. Thus, we also used random-sample consensus
(RANSAC; Fischler & Bolles 1981), a machine-learning
algorithm that identiﬁes and masks outliers in a dataset,
to ﬁt a robust polynomial to each bin. RANSAC itera-
tively selects random subsets of a dataset, ﬁtting them
with a speciﬁed model (in this case, a third-order poly-
nomial). The model describing the subset is compared
to all points not in the subset, and if a certain number
of them agree with the model to within a speciﬁed toler-
ance, they are considered inliers, as are the points in the
original subset. The model is then ﬁtted to the set of
inliers to produce the provisional best-ﬁt model; outliers
are ignored. RANSAC repeats this process with diﬀer-
ent subsets, attempting to ﬁnd the provisional best-ﬁt
model with the lowest residuals.

The left panel in Figure 4 plots the phases of orbital
maximum as measured by the robust polynomials, and
to illustrate how the choice of ﬁtting algorithm impacts
the measured phase of orbital maximum, the right panel
shows a comparison of the least-squares and RANSAC
ﬁts to the ﬁrst CRTS bin. Additionally, Table 1 lists the

phases of maximum light using the two ﬁtting methods,
along with 1σ uncertainties.

Both ﬁtting techniques agree that there was a phase
shift towards later phases in the 2005-2007 CRTS bin,
but the robust polynomial shows it to be larger and
more statistically signiﬁcant. Although the contempo-
raneous K2 and 2014 ASAS-SN observations are weakly
suggestive of a small phase shift, the data after the ﬁrst
CRTS bin are consistent with an essentially constant
phase of orbital maximum, so any periodicity in the
phase of maximum light must be much longer than the
available baseline of data. In addition, as Table 1 indi-
cates, the maximum of the orbital light curve was ∼0.2
mag fainter in the earliest CRTS bin than in the other
two CRTS bins, and the 2014 ASAS-SN bin was ∼0.1
mag fainter than the 2015 and 2016 ASAS-SN data.

Because of a bandpass diﬀerence between CRTS and
ASAS-SN, the peak magnitudes of the CRTS and ASAS-
SN orbital modulation cannot be directly compared with
each other.
It is for a similar reason that we did not
attempt to measure the peak magnitude in the K2 data;
a single Kepler magnitude cannot be reliably compared
with magnitude estimates from other sources on the level
of a tenth of a magnitude.

For the CRTS and ASAS-SN data, we used 2,000
Monte Carlo simulations to test the susceptibility of the
ﬁtting procedure to false phase shifts induced by the
combined eﬀects of (1) sparse sampling, (2) propagated
uncertainties from the orbital ephemeris, and (3) the dif-
ﬁculty of disentangling the orbital modulation from the
beat pulses. The simulations made use of 22 hours of
unﬁltered photometry of AR Sco obtained at a typical
cadence of ∼5 s with the University of Notre Dame’s
80-cm Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope (SLKT) during

2016 and 2017; at this cadence, the beat pulsations are
reasonably well-sampled.1 The Monte Carlo procedure
was as follows. Each simulation began by computing
new orbital phases for all data, based on the uncertain-
ties from the Marsh et al. (2016) orbital ephemeris. For
each CRTS or ASAS-SN observation in a given bin, we
found the SLKT observation with the most similar or-
bital phase. To simulate random sampling of the beat
pulse, we then randomly selected an SLKT observation
obtained within ± 1
2 Pbeat of that point and calculated
the average SLKT magnitude within a timespan equal
to the exposure time of the survey photometry. Using
this technique, each simulation created a unique syn-
thetic light curve whose sampling and time resolution
match that of the underlying survey photometry. Fi-
nally, each simulated light curve was ﬁt with third-order
least-squares and RANSAC polynomials. The phase of
maximum light and the peak magnitude of the orbital
modulation were extracted from the ﬁts.

Since sparse sampling is not an issue with the K2
photometry, we simply simulated Gaussian scatter in
the ﬂux for each K2 observation as well as propagated
uncertainties from the orbital ephemeris. While this re-
sults in comparatively small uncertainties, there is prob-
ably an unquantiﬁed systematic error stemming from
the fact that the beat pulses are fully blended into the
orbital modulation, thereby distorting the orbital pro-
ﬁle. Each K2 integration includes about 15 beat pulses,
and because the beat pulses are strongest before the
orbital maximum, their contamination will shift the or-
bital maximum towards earlier phases. The uncertainty

Littlefield et al.

for the K2 phase of orbital maximum does not model
this eﬀect.

For both the least-squares and RANSAC ﬁts, Table 1
lists the fraction of simulations for each bin in which
the simulated phase shift was larger than the observed
phase shift. The results suggest that the three aforemen-
tioned eﬀects are insuﬃcient to produce the observed
phase shift in the earliest CRTS bin; not one of the
simulated phase shifts for that bin was larger than the
measured value. Additionally, the simulations suggest
that the small phase shift in the 2014 ASAS-SN bin is of
marginal signiﬁcance, but given the comparatively small
size of this phase shift relative to its 1σ uncertainty, it
is possible that our simulations did not fully account for
all possible causes of false phase shifts.

3. CONCLUSION

The K2 observations from 2014 establish limits on the
stability of the optical orbital modulations of AR Sco on
timescales of months and show low-amplitude, appar-
ently aperiodic ﬂuctuations with an unknown source.
Because it is well-deﬁned with very little scatter, the

K2 orbital modulation is a useful point of comparison
for the orbital waveforms of the CRTS and ASAS-SN
datasets, helping to establish that in early CRTS obser-
vations, the peak of the orbital waveform was consider-
ably fainter than in subsequent years.

An analysis of the orbital phase of maximum light re-
veals a signiﬁcant phase shift in the earliest CRTS data
(2005-2007), but the data from 2008-2016 are consistent
with an unchanged phase of orbital maximum. In the
2005-2007 CRTS data, the peak magnitude of the or-
bital modulation is about ∼0.2 mag fainter than in the
remaining CRTS bins. The apparent lack of a coherent
trend in the phase of orbital maximum rules out sinu-
soidal variations on timescales of ∼20 years, but with
only 11 years of observations, there is insuﬃcient data
to discount the possibility of a longer periodicity. Katz’s
misaligned-spin model predicts a precessional period of
up to several centuries, so sustained long-term monitor-
ing of the orbital modulation will be necessary to test
this possibility.

We thank the referee for a thoughtful report that led

to the improvement of this paper.
