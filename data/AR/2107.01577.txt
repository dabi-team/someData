ABSTRACT
Coronal upﬂows at the edges of active regions (AR), which are a possible source of
slow solar wind, have been found to connect with dynamics in the transition region. To
infer at what scale transition region dynamics connect to AR upﬂows, we investigate the
statistical properties of the small-scale dynamics in the transition region underneath the
upﬂows at the edge of AR NOAA 11934. With observations from the Interface Region
Imaging Spectragraph (IRIS), we found that the Si iv 1403 ˚A Doppler map consists
of numerous blue-shifted and red-shifted patches mostly with sizes less than 1 Mm2.
The blue-shifted structures in the transition region tend to be brighter than the red-
shifted ones, but their nonthermal velocities have no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. With the
SWAMIS feature tracking procedure, in IRIS slit-jaw 1400 ˚A images we found that
dynamic bright dots with an average size of about 0.3 Mm2 and lifetimes mostly less
than 200 s spread all over the region. Most of the bright dots appear to be localised,
without clear signature of propagation of plasma to a long distance on the projection
plane. Surge-like motions with speeds about 15 km s−1 could be seen in some events
at the boundaries of the upﬂow region, where the magnetic ﬁeld appear to be inclined.
We conclude that the transition region dynamics connecting to coronal upﬂows should
occur in very ﬁne scale, suggesting that the corresponding coronal upﬂows should also
be highly-structured. It is also plausible that the transition region dynamics might just
act as stimulation at the coronal base that then drives the upﬂows in the corona.

ﬂows on the Doppler velocity maps measured
with coronal spectral
lines (e.g. Marsch et al.
2004; Harra et al. 2008; Doschek et al. 2008;
Brooks et al. 2015). The line-of-sight veloc-
ities of these plasma upﬂows in the corona
are normally in the range of 10–50 km s−1 (for
summaries, see reviews by Abbo et al. 2016;
Hinode Review Team et al. 2019; Tian et al.
2021).

Many studies (e.g. Brooks & Warren 2011,
2012; Culhane et al. 2014; Brooks et al. 2015)
found that the relative abundance of low ﬁrst
ionisation potential (FIP) elements of the ac-
tive region upﬂows is enhanced signiﬁcantly, in-
dicating a source region diﬀerent from the pho-
tosphere (Fu et al. 2017). Marsch et al. (2004)
found a consistency between upﬂow features in
C iv (with a formation temperature of 0.1 MK)
and those in Ne viii (with a formation tem-
perature of 0.6 MK), which suggests the up-
ﬂows might be started in a place where C iv
is formed (i.e. mid-transition-region) or lower.
The existence of upﬂows in the transition region
of open ﬁeld regions have also been conﬁrmed
by observations of O iv lines (Marsch et al.
2008). Using both imaging and spectral data,
He et al. (2010) found in a case that the
plasma ﬂows upward along a strand intermit-
tently with chromospheric jets occurring at
its root, suggesting a chromospheric origin of
the upﬂows. Similarly, De Pontieu & McIntosh
(2010) suggest that chromospheric jets that
are rapidly heated to coronal temperatures at
low heights are associated with quasi-periodic
loops (Guo et al. 2010;
upﬂows along coronal
Tian et al. 2011, 2012; Ruan et al. 2016). A
study by Nishizuka & Hara (2011) also shows a
similarity between the spectral proﬁles of a jet
and those of the upﬂow, and thus it suggests
that the upﬂow might originate in the lower
corona via explosive processes. A case study
on interaction between an EIT wave and a re-
gion of active region upﬂows suggests that the

upﬂows can be disturbed by activities in various
layer of the solar atmosphere (Chen et al. 2011).
A further study involving Hα images sug-
gests that chromospheric jets alone cannot
supply enough materials to the active region
upﬂows (Vanninathan et al. 2015). The phe-
nomenon might be resulted from both magnetic-
reconnection-induced jets and pressure-induced
ﬂows in the lower solar atmosphere (Liu & Su
2014; Srivastava et al. 2014; Galsgaard et al.
2015) and it
requires even more compli-
cate processes to allow the plasma to escape
to the slow solar wind (D´emoulin et al. 2013;
Mandrini et al. 2014; Baker et al. 2017). On
another hand, Warren et al. (2011) found that
the upﬂow region can have complex velocity
structures, including the outﬂow regions with
little or no emission in Si vii and those along
fan loops with downﬂows in their cooler foot-
points (see also Ugarte-Urra & Warren 2011;
Such complex veloc-
Young et al. 2012).
ity structure in active region upﬂows has
also been conﬁrmed from the aspects of im-
(Boutry et al. 2012), density distribu-
ages
tions (Kitagawa & Yokoyama 2015) and ﬁeld
extrapolations (Edwards et al. 2016).

Recently, by analysing coordinated data from
Hinode and High-resolution Coronal Imager
(Hi-C), Brooks et al. (2020) found that the
emission of the active region upﬂow region con-
tain two components, one from expand plasma
related to expelled close loops and the other one
from the dynamic activity in the plage region.
More importantly, the abundance of the emis-
sion component from the dynamic activity in
the plage region is similar to that of the pho-
tosphere (Brooks et al. 2020). The lower solar
atmosphere origin has also been conﬁrmed by a
very recent study on the upﬂows in a newborn
active region (Brooks et al. 2021).

Based on high resolution spectral observa-
tions from the Interface Region Imaging Spec-
trograph (IRIS), Polito et al. (2020) analysed in

detail the spectral data of Mg ii (low chromo-
sphere line), C ii (mid chromosphere line) and
Si iv (low transition region line) underneath two
upﬂow regions. Their statistics indicates that
the probabilities of blue-shifted pixels in the C ii
and Si iv observations of upﬂow regions are sig-
niﬁcantly higher than those from a nearby moss
regions. They also found signature of chromo-
spheric upﬂows in the asymmetries of Mg ii lines
emitted from the upﬂow regions. They con-
cluded that the atmosphere (from low chromo-
sphere to corona) of the upﬂow regions should
be treated as an interconnected system.

Here, we analyse an IRIS data set of active re-
gion upﬂows, in which we observe clear velocity
and intensity structures in the transition region.
Thanks to the unprecedentedly-high resolution
of the data, we can measure the properties of
the dynamic structures in the transition region.
This will allow us to infer quantitatively at what
scale the transition region dynamics are con-
necting to the coronal upﬂows, and thus help
understand how the activities in the lower at-
mosphere link to the upﬂows in the corona.

3. DATA ANALYSES AND RESULTS

The region of coronal upﬂows shows a blue
shift of 10–20 km s−1 in Fe xii (with a forma-
tion temperature of 1.6 × 106 K), locating at the

east side of the active region (see Figure 1a–c).
Here we focus on the core of the upﬂows, which
presents a dark region with roots of fan loops
surrounded as seen in AIA 171 ˚A images (see
Figure 1a). Such morphology is typical for ac-
tive region upﬂows as shown in previous stud-
ies (e.g. Harra et al. 2008; Brooks et al. 2020;
Polito et al. 2020). The blue-shifted area of

animation is provided online, which displays the evolution of the region from 21:02 UT to 21:25 UT.

the selected region as seen in EIS Fe xii 195 ˚A
line (see the contours shown in Figure 1c) is
about 897 mega-meter2 (Mm2).
If we con-
sider only the dark region surrounded by bright
footpoints of the fan loops, it has an area of
about 156 Mm2 (see the region between the two
dashed lines in Figure 1a).

3.1. Analyses of Si iv 1403 ˚A spectral data
In IRIS Si iv 1403 ˚A (with a formation tem-
perature of 8 × 104 K) observations, the region
is highly structured, where abundant dot-like
brightenings are seen on the intensity map (Fig-
ure 1e&h) and very ﬁne blue- and red-shifted
features on the Doppler velocity map (Fig-

ure 1f&i). Comparing to a surrounding region
with similar intensity structures (see the re-
gion around X=[310,340], Y=[-270,-240] in Fig-
ure 1f),
it is notable that the upﬂow region
includes more blue-shifted structures. This
is in agreement with the results shown in
Polito et al. (2020). The nonthermal velocity
map of the region shows no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
from the surrounding area (see Figure 1d&g),
which is similar to that of a normal plage re-
gion (e.g. Hou et al. 2016b).

We then manually identify the patches of ﬁne
structures in the Si iv 1403 ˚A Doppler map un-
derneath the coronal upﬂows (i.e. blue shifts

in Fe xii line, see the contour in Figure 1). The
edge of each (blue-)red-shifted patch is deﬁned
at the place where the absolute speeds are less
than 5 km s−1. Most of the identiﬁed ve-
locity patches have Doppler shifts from 10 to
20 km s−1. The identiﬁed small-scaled velocity
structures and their corresponding intensity and
nonthermal velocity ones are shown in Figure 2.
In total, 102 blue-shifted patches and 96 red-
shifted patches are identiﬁed. The sizes of the
blue-shifted patches are in the range of 0.05–
6.79 Mm2, and those of the red-shifted patches

are ranging from 0.05–12.18 Mm2. With these
samples, 99% of the blue-shifted ones and 97%
of the red-shifted ones are smaller than 5 Mm2,
in which more than 70% are smaller than 1 Mm2
(see Figure 1d). The total areas of the blue-
shifted and red-shifted patches are 74 Mm2 and
98 Mm2, respectively. Please notice that the
average Doppler velocity in this region remains
red-shifted. We can see that the total area of
the upﬂow region in the corona is larger than the
size of any single patch of these velocity struc-
tures in the transition region for 2–3 magni-

tudes. The histogram of Si iv intensity of blue-
shifted features shows a clear enhancement at
higher intensity (see Figure 1e). The average
intensity of the blue-shifted pixels is 75 DN in
comparison to 43 DN for the red-shifted ones.
This indicates that comparing to the red-shifted
features, the blue-shifted ones tend to be associ-
ated with brighter regions in the transition re-
gion. The nonthermal velocities, however, do
not show any obvious diﬀerence in their his-
tograms (Figure 2f), suggesting that heating in
these velocity structures should be statistically
similar to the ambient region.

3.2. Transition region dynamics seen in IRIS

1400 ˚A slit-jaw images

From IRIS SJ 1400 ˚A observations (Figure 3
and the associated animation), we can see the
upﬂow region is full of dynamic dot-like bright-
enings. Some of them are corresponding to the
bright dots in the Si iv intensity image.

In order to study the dynamic properties of
these bright dots, we adopt a feature track-
ing method, the “Southwest Automatic Mag-
netic Identiﬁcation Suite” (or “SWAMIS” in
short), to identify and trace them in the IRIS SJ
1400 ˚A observations. SWAMIS has been widely
used in tracking magnetic features on the pho-
tosphere (e.g. Lamb 2008; Parnell et al. 2009;
Huang et al. 2012; Lamb et al. 2014, etc.), and
the detailed methodology of SWAMIS can be
seen in a series of papers (DeForest et al. 2007;
Lamb et al. 2008, 2010, 2013). To setup the

of the starting and ending time and also the
edges of a feature; the “downhill” method was
chosen to detect the edges of a feature, which

low threshold. The thresholds were selected in
the way that they are given robustly and they
can cover most of the bright dots as seen man-
ually (see an example in Figure 4). In the ob-
servations from 21:02 UT to 21:25 UT, SWAMIS

give the statistics of the areas (panel a), life-

and death location (panel c) and eﬀective speeds
(i.e. shift divided by lifetime, panel d) and dis-
tributions of the bright dots in the spaces of
shifts vs. lifetimes (panel e) and areas vs. eﬀec-
tive speeds (panel f).

The areas of all these bright dots have an av-
erage of 0.3 Mm2. The histogram of the ar-
eas peaks at about 0.1 Mm2 and 99% of the
bright dots are smaller than 1 Mm2. These
again conﬁrm the transition region dynamics
underneath the upﬂow region occurs in very ﬁne
scale. While about 95% of the bright dots have
lifetimes smaller than 200 s, we also notice that

Transition region beneath active region upflows

11

about 44% are identiﬁed in only one frame of
the images, indicating their lifetimes are smaller
than 10 s. Quantitatively, this conﬁrms a highly
dynamic nature of the transition region under-
neath the upﬂow region. We also conﬁrm that
many bright dots can be born in the same lo-
cations, suggesting that they are intermittent
phenomena.

From the animation of SJ 1400 ˚A observa-
tions (Figure 3), we can see that most of the
bright dots at the center of the upﬂow region
are mostly localized without signiﬁcant motions
away from the initial locations. This is con-
ﬁrmed by the measurement of shifts of their
brightest centers given by SWAMIS (Figure 5c),
where we can see more than 75% of the bright
dots hardly have any movement and more than
98% shift for a distance less than 1 Mm. If we
took into account their sizes, only about 6% can
shift further than their initial boundaries. Ac-
cordingly, the eﬀective speeds of about 65% of
the bright dots are around zero and 98% are less
than 15 km s−1.

The scatter plot in the panel (e) of Figure 5
shows a weak trend in statistics that bright
dots with larger shifts tend to have longer life-
times, although the distribution is rather dis-
perse. The scatter distribution of the bright
dots in the space of areas vs. eﬀective speeds
(panel (f) of Figure 5) indicates that high speed
(> 20 km s−1) bright dots are concentrate at ar-
eas around 0.3 Mm2 and bright dots with larger
areas tend to have a smaller upper limit of
speeds.

Surge-like motions can be seen in the bright
dots at the edge of the region, where elongated
dark threads are also abundant (suggesting in-

two examples of surges. A distinguished char-
acteristics is that these surges normally show
a bright front (see the top row of Figure 6),
which is similar to light walls occurring above
light bridges of sunspots (see e.g. Yang et al.

2015; Hou et al. 2016a), and might be a hint
of shocks (Zhang et al. 2017; Hou et al. 2017,
2018). The upward motions of these surges
have speeds of 12–17 km s−1, and the downward
speeds are slightly smaller (the bottom panel
of Figure 6). These values are consistent with
the velocity structures measured in the spec-
tral data. Therefore, it remains possible that a
part of bright dots in the center region also have
surge-like motions but they cannot be resolved
due to the projection eﬀect.

3.3. The chromosphere and photosphere
underneath the active region upﬂows

In Figure 7, we further investigate the coun-
terpart of the upﬂow region in the lower chro-
mosphere and photosphere. The high resolution
magnetogram shows that the region is dominant
by negative polarity (Figure 7a). This suggests
(quasi-)open magnetic ﬁeld could be exist in a
part of this region, in agreement with previous
studies (e.g. Baker et al. 2009). The radiation
image near 2832 ˚A shows that the upﬂow region
has a typical morphology of faculae (Figure 7b).
Consistent with the faculae in the photosphere,
chromospheric plage in the region is clearly seen
in the SOT Ca ii h image (Figure 7c).

The upﬂow region seen in Mg ii line is shown
in Figure 7d–f. We can see that the intensity
maps of Mg ii h wings and line center are gen-
erally in agreement with each other, suggest-
ing this region in the middle and upper chro-
mosphere are coherent (Leenaarts et al. 2013;
Pereira et al. 2013). At the edge of the region,
the elongated dark threads shown in SJ 1400 ˚A
images are also seen in the chromosphere. While
cross-checking these maps in detail, we can
see that some blue-shifted structures present as
dark features in the blue wing image but as
bright ones in the red wing, or vice-versa for
some red-shifted structures. This suggests that
plasma ﬂows in the chromosphere and transi-
tion region are coherent in these locations (see
relevant discussion in Testa et al. 2020). This is

consistent with previous studies as summarized
in the introduction.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

To infer at what scale the transition region
connects to the coronal upﬂows at the edge of
active region, in the present study we investi-
gate the statistical properties of small-scale dy-
namics in the transition region underneath the
upﬂows of active region NOAA 11934. Consis-
tent with previous studies, the transition region
underneath the coronal upﬂows is also highly
structured. While the upﬂows in the corona
are a continuous region with an area of about
897 Mm2, the velocity structures in the tran-
sition region are ﬁnely scaled as shown on the
Si iv 1403 ˚A Doppler map.
In the Si iv 1403 ˚A
Doppler velocity map, we identiﬁed 102 blue-
shifted patches and 96 red-shifted patches. We
found that 99% of the blue-shifted patches and
97% of the red-shifted patches are smaller than
5 Mm2, in which more than 70% are smaller
than 1 Mm2. The total area of the blue-shifted
features is about 74 Mm2, a magnitude smaller
Statistically, the
than the coronal upﬂows.
Si iv 1403 ˚A intensities of the blue-shifted fea-
tures are biased towards the large values, com-
paring to those of the red-shifted ones. The
histograms of nonthermal velocities of both the
blue- and red-shifted features do not show any
obvious diﬀerence from that of the entire region.
The IRIS SJ 1400 ˚A images show that dy-
namic bright dots spread all over the transi-
tion region underneath the coronal upﬂow re-
gion. Using SWAMIS, more than 20 000 bright
dots in the SJ 1400 ˚A images were identiﬁed and
tracked. We found that their average area is
0.3 Mm2. The distribution of their areas peaks
at 0.1 Mm2 and 99% of them are smaller than
1 Mm2. Their lifetimes are from 10 s to a few
minutes, in which more than 95% are less than
200 s. Statistically, about 94% of the bright dots
do not show any distinguishable shifts in the
plane of sky. Some bright dots might have high

apparent speeds (>20 km s−1), and the distri-
bution of their areas concentrates at around
0.3 Mm2. Surge-like motions with speeds of 10–
20 km s−1 are clearly seen at the edge of the
region, and they normally have a bright front.
We speculate that similar motions should also
exist in the center part of the region, but they
cannot be resolved due to the projection eﬀect.
The high-resolution magnetogram reveals that
the upﬂow region is of single polarity, indicating
a (quasi-)open magnetic geometry. The coro-
nal upﬂows locate above faculae as seen in IRIS
2832 ˚A image and plage region in the SOT Ca ii
image, suggesting an active magnetic environ-
ment. In agreement with the previous studies
(see summary in the introduction), we found
that plasma ﬂows in some velocity structures in
Si iv 1403 ˚A are consistent with those revealed
by Mg ii h, suggesting a coherence of plasma
ﬂows in these places between the chromosphere
and transition region.

In light of these observations, we might fur-
ther discuss on the formation of the active re-
gion upﬂows in the corona. As summarised in
the introduction, many previous studies found
that active region upﬂows have strong connec-
tion to dynamics of the transition region or even
lower. This is also conﬁrmed by our observa-
tions.
In the present study, we further carry
out a statistic analysis to small-scale dynamics
in the transition region underneath the active
region upﬂows. The size and dynamic proper-
ties of these structures indicate that the connec-
tion between the transition region and the coro-
nal upﬂows is most likely taken place in small
scale (.1 Mm2) and a rapid and intermittent
process (evolving in a time scale less than a few
minutes). The question is how such small-scale
dynamics in the transition region links to the
upﬂows in the corona.

An interpretation is that the plasma in the
transition region is directly heated and pumped
In this way, the coronal
into the corona.

upﬂows should be structured in smaller scale
rather than a continuous region, since the up-
ﬂows in the transition region are localised with
sizes of about 1 Mm2. Such smaller structures
might not be able to resolve with EIS data,
and spectral data with higher resolutions from
such as SPICE (Spice Consortium et al. 2020)
aboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO, M¨uller et al.
2020) should be helpful. Comparing the total
blue-shifted area in the transition region and
the coronal upﬂows, we can estimate a ﬁlling
factor of about 0.08 for the EIS observations
of this coronal upﬂow region. For EIS obser-
vations of typical fan loops, Young et al. (2012)
found a ﬁlling factor of about 0.2, which is more
than twice of the value derived here. A possi-
ble reason for this inconsistency could be the
expansion of the fan loops and their projection
eﬀects. For an isolated typical fan loop shown
in the south of the studied ﬁeld-of-view (see the
region denoted by a trapezoid in Figure 1a), we
estimate from the AIA 171 ˚A image that a fan
near the foot-
with a cross-section of about 6
point can expand to about 20
at a distance of
on the projection plate. Suppose the fan
25
has a circular disc of the footpoint (with a di-
ameter of 6
), we found that the projection area
can be more than 10 times of the footpoint. Al-
though this factor can be seriously inﬂuenced
by inclined angles and overlapping eﬀects, the
expansion of fan loops can easily explain the rel-
atively small ﬁlling factor estimated here. An-
other reason could be the underestimation of
the area of upﬂows in the transition region, since
only one raster of data was taken here and one
cannot exclude possible contribution of regions
other than the blue-shifted patches.

Alternatively, the small scale dynamics in the
transition region can just act as drivers that
stimulate the coronal base of the open ﬁeld re-
gion and then force the plasmas there moving
upward to form the coronal upﬂows. Similarly,
evidence that dynamics from the lower solar at-

mosphere can drive coronal propagating distur-
bances has been reported by some studies (e.g.
Pant et al. 2015; Jiao et al. 2015; Hou et al.
2018, etc.). With this scenario, the upﬂows in
the transition region can fall back after stimu-
lating the coronal base and transferring energy
to the corona, thus it explains why the blue-
shifted features tend to be brighter than the red-
shifted ones. Also, the transition region dynam-
ics can have any sizes and not be necessary to be
comparable to the coronal upﬂows. The abun-
dance of the small-scale dynamics in the tran-
sition region at any given time should be able
to provide enough drivers to the coronal base.
We might assume a funnel geometry of the up-
ﬂows as similar to those in coronal holes (see e.g.
Dowdy et al. 1986; Tu et al. 2005), then two
possible processes might involve in driving the
coronal upﬂows. One is interaction with shocks,
in which the shock energy carried by surges
hit the coronal base of the funnel and trans-
fer energy to corona (Hou et al. 2018). Another
one is interchange reconnection between a fun-
nel and small-scale loops (Fisk 2005). Actually,
interchange reconnection scenario for active re-
gion upﬂows has been proposed or suggested by
many previous studies (e.g. Baker et al. 2009;
Del Zanna et al. 2011; Barczynski et al. 2021,
etc.). The small-scale loops here could be un-
derstood as small transition region loops that
might be propelled by surges and then interact
with coronal funnels, or small magnetic islands
associated with energetic events in the transi-
tion region (Innes et al. 2015) that carry close
ﬁelds moving and interacting with coronal fun-
nels.
