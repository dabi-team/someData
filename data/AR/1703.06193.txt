Muon Counting using Silicon Photomultipliers in the

AMIGA detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory

The Pierre Auger collaboration

E-mail: auger_spokespersons@fnal.gov

Abstract: AMIGA (Auger Muons and Inﬁll for the Ground Array) is an upgrade of the Pierre
Auger Observatory designed to extend its energy range of detection and to directly measure the
muon content of the cosmic ray primary particle showers. The array will be formed by an inﬁll
of surface water-Cherenkov detectors associated with buried scintillation counters employed for
muon counting. Each counter is composed of three scintillation modules, with a 10 m2 detection
area per module. In this paper, a new generation of detectors, replacing the current multi-pixel
photomultiplier tube (PMT) with silicon photo sensors (aka. SiPMs), is proposed. The selection
of the new device and its front-end electronics is explained. A method to calibrate the counting
system that ensures the performance of the detector is detailed. This method has the advantage of
being able to be carried out in a remote place such as the one where the detectors are deployed.
High eﬃciency results, i.e. 98 % eﬃciency for the highest tested overvoltage, combined with a low
probability of accidental counting (∼2 %), show a promising performance for this new system.

Introduction

The Pierre Auger Obsevatory [1] is located in the province of Mendoza, Argentina and has an
area of 3000 km2. It was designed to detect ultra-high energy cosmic ray showers with a hybrid
detection technique. It has 1660 surface water-Cherenkov detector stations (SDs) [2] arranged in
a triangular grid with a distance of ∼1.5 km between stations, and 27 ﬂuorescence detector (FD)
telescopes [3] at four sites on the periphery of the array pointing towards the atmosphere and the
center of the array. The Auger Observatory is currently being upgraded, and AMIGA [4–6] (Auger
Muons and Inﬁll for the Ground Array) is one of its principal enhancements. Two of the main
objectives of AMIGA are the measurement of composition-sensitive observables of extensive air
showers and the study of features of hadronic interactions. Important results on cosmic ray physics
by means of muon detection techniques have been previously obtained by several experiments like
KASCADE [7] and KASCADE-Grande [8].

AMIGA consists of 61 detector pairs, each one composed of a SD station and a 30 m2 muon
counter, deployed on a 750 m triangular grid in an inﬁlled area of 23.5 km2. At the Observatory site,
the associated SD triggers the muon counter (MC) when a candidate cosmic ray shower is measured.
Each muon counter is buried 2.3 m underground to shield the electromagnetic component of cosmic
ray showers (vertical shielding of 540 g/cm2) and it is composed of three scintillation modules.
Every module comprises 64 scintillation bars, each of dimensions 400 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm, with a
1.2 mm diameter wavelength-shifting (WLS) optical ﬁber (BCF-99-29AMC) glued to a lengthwise
groove on each bar. The light produced in the bars is absorbed by the WLS ﬁber. The excited
molecules of the ﬁber decay while emitting photons, some of which are propagated along the WLS
ﬁbers towards a channel of a multi-pixel photon detector. The aim of these modules is to eﬃciently
count the number of muons that impinge on the 10 m2 area of scintillation. The mechanical detector
design is ﬁxed and detailed in [9]. An engineering array of seven muon counters with multi-pixel
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) is already installed and acquiring data at the Observatory site.

For the production of AMIGA the current PMTs are going to be replaced with silicon photo
sensors (aka. SiPMs). The main motivations for this upgrade are the advantages of these devices
compared to current PMTs: their lower cost per channel, longer life-time, better sturdiness, higher
photon detection eﬃciency at the optical ﬁber emission wavelength, and no optical cross-talk
between channels. The main disadvantages of SiPMs are its higher noise rate and temperature
dependence. In this paper is explained how, with the proposed electronics and calibration method,
these disadvantages are addressed.

The present paper is organized as follows: a general description of the SiPM behavior is detailed
in section 2. Then the SiPM and the front-end electronics selection is explained in section 3. The
proposed calibration of the counting system is described in section 4. Finally, the eﬃciency
measurements are shown in section 5.

2 The Silicon Photomultiplier

A SiPM [10] is a solid-state device capable of detecting individual photons. It is composed of an
array of cells, all connected in parallel. Each cell has an avalanche photo-diode (APD) working in
Geiger mode and a quenching resistor (RQ) in series (see ﬁgure 1).

Figure 1. Schematic view of the internal structure of a SiPM made up of an array of cells, all connected in
parallel. Each cell is composed of an APD working in Geiger mode and a quenching resistor (RQ) in series.

The APD starts working in Geiger mode when the reverse voltage (Vbias) applied to it exceeds
a speciﬁc voltage value called the breakdown voltage (VBR). In this mode the injection of a single
charge carrier (e.g. due to an impinging photon) causes a self-sustained avalanche. The current that
ﬂows through the APD depends on the voltage value over the breakdown which is called overvoltage
(∆V = Vbias − VBR). The ﬂow of this current through RQ produces the decrease of the reverse
voltage (VAPD) applied to the APD. When VAPD is below VBR the avalanche is extinguished. This
last sequence describes the “ﬁring” of a cell. From now on, the signal produced by this ﬁring
process will be called single photon equivalent (SPE). If multiple cells are ﬁred simultaneously the
resulting output signal will be a superposition of SPEs. The amplitude of this signal will be directly
proportional to the number of ﬁred cells.

As was previously mentioned, SiPMs are employed to detect photons. An undesirable eﬀect
is the accidental counting of those photons due to noise in the cells. In the next subsection, the
sources of noise are deﬁned.

2.1 SiPM Noise

Noise in SiPMs [11] is deﬁned as the ﬁring of a cell that was not produced by a photon impinging
the device. There are three noise sources which can be separated in two types, depending on the
correlation or not with the ﬁring of a cell.

2.1.1 Uncorrelated Noise: Dark Noise

Dark noise occurs randomly due to thermally-generated charge carriers (electron-hole pairs) either
in the depletion region or in the avalanche region [12]. The amplitude and shape of these pulses are
the same as the ones produced by the absorption of a photon. Dark noise is sensitive to temperature,
and also depends on the array size, overvoltage magnitude, and semiconductor material quality.

– 3 –

2.1.2 Correlated Noise: Afterpulsing and Cross-Talk

Afterpulsing is a secondary avalanche produced after the ﬁring of a cell, due to the release of trapped
charges. The release of these trapped charges occurs after a characteristic time that depends on the
type of the trapping centers and its occurrence probability decreases exponentially with time. It is
noise correlated to the ﬁring of a cell and it is produced in the same cell.

When a primary avalanche in a cell produces photons with energy greater than the band gap
energy, there is a probability that a nearby cell absorbs the photon, producing its ﬁring. As a
ﬁrst order approximation, the secondary avalanche is synchronized in time with the main primary
avalanche to produce a resulting signal of a channel with an increased amount of SPEs stacked.
This eﬀect is called cross-talk.

3 Proposed Readout for AMIGA Muon Counters

As mentioned in the Introduction, for the production of AMIGA, the current PMTs are going to be
replaced with SiPMs. The mechanical module design is already ﬁxed. One of the characteristics
that constrains the proposed readout for AMIGA muon counters is its segmentation. The detector is
segmented, in space as well as in time, to prevent undercounting due to simultaneous muon arrivals:

• Segmentation in space. Based on simulations [13], each of the three scintillator modules of

a muon counter has been segmented into 64 segments.

• Segmentation in time. This segmentation is limited by the time distribution of the photons
produced by the impinging particle. This time distribution is deﬁned by the convolution of
the probability distributions characterized by the decay time of the scintillator, the decay time
of the optical ﬁber, and to a lesser extent the propagation mode in the optical ﬁber. The
maximum time width of a light signal for AMIGA MCs is between 25 to 35 ns [14].

The proposed electronics of the module must facilitate the identiﬁcation of pulses above a
given threshold to allow muon counting, without knowing in detail the signal structure and peak
intensity. The proposed readout must not degrade the detector segmentation.

A SiPM model and new electronics for the readout of AMIGA MCs are proposed in the next
two subsections, based on the experience of the current version of the AMIGA electronics [15, 16].

3.1 SiPM Selection

Two main features which improve the signal-to-noise ratio were taken into account in order to select
the speciﬁc device: high photo-detection eﬃciency (PDE) and low noise. The PDE of the selected
devices is around 35 % for the peak emission wavelength of the ﬁber optic (485 nm). Low noise is
obtained by combining low dark rate with reduced cross-talk and low afterpulsing probability.

Three devices manufactured by Hamamatsu (S12572-100C, S12571-100C, S13081-050CS)
were tested in the laboratory to evaluate their performance. In Figure 2 an overlap of 5000 dark rate
traces of each SiPM model is shown. Pulses of more than one SPE, stacked due to cross-talk, can
be observed synchronized with the trigger time. Afterpulsing pulses can also be observed after the
trigger time.

– 4 –

Figure 2. Overlap of 5000 dark rate traces (signal amplitude as a function of time) of each SiPM model.
All measurements were done with the same ampliﬁer at 25 ◦C. The ∆V of each SiPM was set to the value
recommended by Hamamatsu.

The three SiPMs exempliﬁed are some of the latest devices developed by Hamamatsu up
to 2015. The second SiPM (S12571-100C) in ﬁgure 2 shows a reduction in the afterpulsing
probability compared to the ﬁrst one (S12572-100C). The third model (S13081-050CS) not only
shows a reduction in the afterpulsing, but also a signiﬁcantly lower value of cross-talk. The
main characteristics of these SiPMs, obtained from the Hamamtsu datasheets, are summarized in
table 3.1.

The criteria selected for counting muons is to count pulses above a given threshold. In this
context, cross-talk probability becomes a relevant parameter. This correlated noise makes possible
that a pulse triggered by dark noise or afterpulsing could have an amplitude above the selected
threshold. Therefore, cross-talk should be as small as possible to reduce the accidental counting
probability. The selected device for this work was the third model (S13081-050CS) mainly due to
its low cross-talk probability and also its low dark noise and afterpulsing.

3.2 Proposed Electronics

The proposed electronics is based on the existing AMIGA system. The following main speciﬁcations
were considered for the design:

1. The new electronics design must be compatible with the existing mechanical design of the
detector. There is no access to the optical ﬁbers, only to the optical connector. Fibers of
1.2 mm diameter are glued to the optical connector in a squared arrangement of 8×8 and the
separation distance between two neighboring ﬁbers centers is 2.3 mm.

2. The electronics must be able to identify light pulses with a maximum time width between
25 to 35 ns. This upper limit is obtained from the light pulses time width distribution. This
distribution is the result of the convolution of the probability distributions characterized by
the decay time of the scintillator, the decay time of the optical ﬁber, and to a lesser extent the
propagation mode in the optical ﬁber.

3. Low power consumption (stand-alone power system).

4. The output of each SiPM channel must be a digital 0-1 signal to allow muon counting. The
digital output width must be similar to the characteristic time width of the light pulses produced
in the detector. Wider digital signals are not desired since the detection of consecutive muons
in the same bar could be deteriorated (pile-up eﬀect).

5. Temperature compensation (SiPM breakdown voltage depends on temperature).

The Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Cherenkov Imaging Telescope Integrated
Read Out Chip (CITIROC) [19] was proposed for the front-end readout of AMIGA. The CITIROC
ASIC is a 32 channel front-end specially designed for the readout of SiPMs. An adjustment of
the SiPM biasing is possible using a channel-by-channel 8-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
connected to the ASIC inputs. Each channel has a pre-ampliﬁer stage that can be selected by software
between a low or high gain pre-ampliﬁer. Also each corresponding gain value is programmable.
Then the signal passes through a 15 ns peaking time fast shaper followed by a discriminator. The
discriminator threshold is set coarsely by a 10-bit DAC (common for the 32 channels) and then set
ﬁnely channel by channel by individual 4-bit DACs. The 15 ns peaking time fast shaper enables a
digital output width of the discriminator similar to the characteristic time width of the light pulses
produced by the impinging particles in the detector. The fast shaper produces an undesirable eﬀect.
It has a negative overshot which might inﬂuence the detection eﬃciency for the next close in time
muon. The capability to detect two consecutive muons is not within the scope of this work. This
eﬀect and others like larger signal time width, due to the WLS ﬁber decay time, and the recovery
time of cells in the SiPM, must be studied further in the future.

For the biasing and temperature compensation of each SiPM, the Hamamatsu C11204-01 power
supply [20] was selected due to the recommendation of Hamamatsu. This power supply has one
output with low ripple noise (0.1 mVp-p typ.), good temperature stability (±10 ppm/◦C typ.) and a
high output voltage resolution (1.8 mV).

4 Calibration Method of the Counting System

The calibration method of the counting system for AMIGA is split into two steps. The ﬁrst step
consists in calibrating the optical sensors of each individual channel (see subsection 4.1) and the
second step consists in calibrating the detector (see subsection 4.2).

4.1 SiPM Calibration

The goal of this calibration is to set the operation point of the SiPMs. First, the breakdown voltage of
each individual channel must be obtained. Then, all the SiPMs must be biased to its corresponding
breakdown voltage with an added pre-determined overvoltage. This overvoltage can be changed to
optimize the eﬃciency. In this section a method for obtaining the breakdown voltage and biasing
of the SiPMs with the proposed AMIGA electronics is explained.

4.1.1 SiPM Calibration Setup

Figure 3. SiPM Calibration Setup. The three stages are distinguished with dotted lines. The output of the
fast shaper ampliﬁer (∗) has a DC oﬀset component.

The setup for the SiPMs calibration is divided into three stages (see ﬁgure 3). The ﬁrst stage is
composed of the SiPM, the high voltage power supply and the temperature sensor. Since the SiPM
breakdown voltage varies signiﬁcantly with temperature, the high voltage power supply has a built-
in high precision temperature compensation system that constantly corrects the SiPM operation
point. This function tries to keep the gain value ﬁxed independently of temperature variations. The
compensation of the high voltage (HV) output of the power supply is determined by the following
equation given by Hamamatsu:

HV = K2 ∗ (T − Tre f )2 + K1 ∗ (T − Tre f ) + Vre f

(4.1)

– 7 –

In this formula, the K2 and K1 are respectively the quadratic and linear coeﬃcients for the temperature
compensation, Vre f is the reference voltage and Tre f is the reference temperature. The temperature
compensation for the SiPMs under test is linear and the quadratic term is not needed. The K2 was
set to 0 mV/◦C2, K1 to 54 mV/◦C (see table 3.1) and Tre f to 25 ◦C. The resulting formula for the
calibration is:

HV = 54 mV/◦C ∗ (T − 25 ◦C) + Vre f

(4.2)

The second stage consists of the CITIROC. This stage ampliﬁes and then discriminates SiPM
pulses. The chip was programmed to use the high gain pre-ampliﬁer, with its maximum gain value
of 150, to improve the separation between SPEs in the SPE spectrum. The 8-bit DAC was set to a
ﬁxed value (e.g. 250 dac-units). The 10-bit DAC was used to set the comparator threshold for all
the channels and the 4-bit DAC of each channel was ﬁxed to its minimum value.

The third stage is composed of an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. The FPGA was programmed to

measure the rate of the CITIROC digital pulses output.

4.1.2 Single Photon Equivalent Peak Measurement

A dedicated software was developed to automatically measure the rate of the digital pulses at
diﬀerent discrimination levels.
In the measurement of the SiPM noise rate as a function of the
10-bit DAC values (see ﬁgure 4, left) there is a clear transition from the ﬁrst to the second plateau.
This transition is required for the calibration and it represents the threshold of the comparator
passing through the ﬁrst SPE peak.

Figure 4. On the left, the measurement of the rate of the SiPM pulses as a function of the DAC value.
DClevel corresponds to the fast shaper DC oﬀset component. See subsection 4.1.1 for details on the setup.
On the right, the absolute value of the derivative of the rate evidences the distribution of the SPE peaks. The
mean value of the SPE peak (Dmax) is obtained with a Gaussian ﬁt of the points (red curve).

The absolute value of the derivative of this curve (see ﬁgure 4, right) represents the distribution
of the SPE peak values. The mean value of the SPE peak (Dmax) is correlated to the maximum
absolute value of the Gaussian distribution coming from the derivative of the rate curve. This
value has an oﬀset (DClevel) because the signal in the fast shaper has a DC oﬀset component (see
ﬁgure 3). The value of this DC oﬀset is the DAC value where the rate is maximum (see ﬁgure 4,

– 8 –

left). To obtain the real value of the SPE peak (SPEpeak) it is necessary to subtract this oﬀset.

SPEpeak = Dmax − DClevel

(4.3)

As was mentioned before, the employment of SiPMs combined with the method explained in
this subsection, allow the SPEpeak estimation which is used to calculate the breakdown voltage of
the device, as it will be explained in the next subsection.

4.1.3 Breakdown Voltage Measurements

There are several methods to estimate the breakdown voltage of a SiPM [21]. Due to the constraints
of the proposed electronics, the method to estimate each channel breakdown voltage is the one
described in this subsection.

The total charge produced in an avalanche can be calculated using equation 4.4 and the gain

(M) of this process is deﬁned by equation 4.5.

Q = Cj∆V

M = Q/e where e is the electron charge.

(4.4)

(4.5)

It can be inferred from these equations that the gain depends linearly on the overvoltage.
Therefore, for the special case when the gain is zero, Vbias = VBR. The functional dependencies
described by these equations are shown in ﬁgure 5, left. This ﬁgure shows that if the gain (M)
is measured over the Vbias, the breakdown voltage can be obtained as the value where the curve
intercepts the X axis (Vbias = VBR). It is also known that the SPEpeak is directly proportional to
the gain (Mean SPEpeak ∝ M). By using this information and following the procedure explained in
the previous subsection, a plot of SPEpeak for diﬀerent Vbias values, can be obtained. An example
for four diﬀerent SiPMs is shown in ﬁgure 5, right. From that plot, the VBR can be estimated as the
point where the linear ﬁt of the curve intercepts the X axis (Vbias = VBR).

Figure 5. Equations 4.4 and 4.5 are presented graphically in the plot on the left. The mean SPEpeak as a
function of the Vbias for four diﬀerent SiPMs is plotted on the right. The mean SPEpeak is proportional to
M.

– 9 –

To automatize the breakdown voltage estimation, the 8-bit DAC of the CITIROC (see ﬁgure 3)
was ﬁxed to 250 dac-units for all the channels and the HV value was modiﬁed in regular steps (Vbias
changes following the power supply HV). With this method, each SiPM characteristic breakdown
voltage was calculated at the same time, with a single power supply. This is required for the
AMIGA design since the 64 channels of each module are connected to the same power supply. In
the following subsection a possible equalization of SiPMs overvoltage is explained following this
constraint.

4.1.4 Equalization Between Channels

The equalization consists in applying the same ∆V to all the 64 channels of one module. This
equalization does not ensure the same gain or rate at a given threshold between channels. To set the
operation voltage for each channel, considering that each SiPM has a diﬀerent breakdown voltage
(VBRi

), the following procedure is carried out:

1. Set the HV voltage of the power supply to the largest VBRi

(VBRma x

) of the 64 SiPMs with

the desired ∆V added. HV = VBRma x

+ ∆V.

2. Set the 8-bit DAC of each CITIROC channel following: V8bit D AC = VBRma x − VBRi

.

4.2 Detector Calibration

Once the SiPM is calibrated, the next step consists of determining the discrimination level and the
counting strategy (detector calibration), ensuring an adequate performance of the counting system.

4.2.1 Detector Calibration Setup

The setup for the detector calibration is divided into six stages (see ﬁgure 6). The ﬁrst and second
stages were described in subsection 4.1.1. For this calibration, the CITIROC was programmed to use
the high gain pre-ampliﬁer with its minimum gain value of ten to reduce the digital time span of the
discriminated pulses. The individual channel threshold DAC (4-bit DAC) was ﬁxed to its minimum
value and the high voltage adjustment DAC (8-bit DAC) was set following the procedure detailed
in the subsection 4.1.4 (equalization). The common chip threshold adjustment DAC (10-bit DAC)
is used to set diﬀerent discrimination levels. The third stage is a wide-band ampliﬁer with a gain
value of ten, to allow the measurement of the analog signal of the SiPM. The fourth stage consists of
a 4 m plastic scintillation bar with a threaded 5 m wavelength-shifting optical ﬁber, built identically
to the scintillator strips that conform an AMIGA muon counter. At the end of the optical ﬁber there
is an optical connector coupled to the SiPM. The extra meter of ﬁber is between the scintillator and
the SiPM. The ﬁfth stage is an ad-hoc muon telescope trigger [22] which triggers the acquisition
every time a particle passes through each position of the main scintillating bar where the telescope
is placed. It consists of two identical parts, each of them made of a scintillator of dimensions 4 cm
x 4 cm x 1 cm with a SiPM coupled for light detection. Both pieces are aligned above and below the
main scintillating bar. The separation distance between triggers is 5 cm and the main scintillating
bar is placed equidistantly between both parts. This conﬁguration selects a particular solid angle
of the muons that impinges the main scintillator. The trigger condition is overcome when the two
SiPMs, up and down, record signals above a given threshold in a time-coincidence window of 60 ns.

– 10 –

There is a probability of ∼2 % of false coincidences of this muon telescope mainly due to three
factors: the probability of two diﬀerent particles impinging each scintillator simultaneously without
passing, neither of them, through the main scintillator, misalignment of the telescope with respect to
the main scintillator, and simultaneous dark noise at both devices. The sixth stage is the acquisition
system. This stage is composed of a Tektronix DPO7104 oscilloscope. This oscilloscope is set up
to store the discriminated signal of the CITIROC (second stage) and the ampliﬁed analog signal of
the SiPM (third stage) every time the muon telescope produces a coincidence in a time window of
60 ns (ﬁfth stage).

Figure 6. The six stages of the setup needed for the detector calibration. The 4 m plastic scintillation bar has
a threaded 5 m wavelength-shifting optical ﬁber. The diﬀerence in length is due to the extra ﬁber needed to
reach the optical connector.

4.2.2 Selection of the Counting Strategy

As was described in [23], the current counting system (PMT and electronics) has been designed
to count muons by identifying a pattern in the digital trace of a ﬁxed length of 3.2 µs. The length
of the digital trace is ﬁxed by the cosmic ray shower duration. The discrimination level is set to
a value lower than one SPE and then a pattern recognition technique is applied to discriminate
particles from noise. This counting strategy takes into account the time structure of the signal over
a threshold.

The proposed counting strategy for the SiPMs is based on an amplitude criteria. The high
noise of SiPMs implies setting a threshold of a small number of SPEs to discriminate particles
from noise. The high PDE (∼35 %) of SiPM at the emission wavelength of the WLS optical ﬁber
mitigates the loss of detection eﬃciency.

– 11 –

The discrimination level is set to the lowest value that ensures a low rate of contamination
(negligible accidental counting) without signiﬁcantly reducing the counting eﬃciency. In ﬁgure 7,
the rate of SiPM pulses as a function of the 10-bit DAC threshold is shown. For these measurements
the muon telescope was not used and the rate is acquired directly from the CITIROC digital output
with a pulse counter programmed in the FPGA. Two cases are plotted: the red complete line is the
rate when the ﬁber is coupled to the SiPM, and the blue dashed line when it is not. When the ﬁber
is not coupled to the SiPM, only the noise from the SiPM is measured. When the ﬁber is coupled
to the SiPM, not only the dark rate and its correlated noise are measured, but also all the signals
produced by charged particles impinging the scintillator. These particles will be considered as the
environmental radiation. This environmental radiation is composed of cosmic ray particles (muons
and others) and radiation of the surrounding materials (e.g. walls, ﬂoor, casing). In ﬁgure 7, for
one and two SPE rate levels, the correlated and the uncorrelated noises, explained in section 2.1,
dominate. If the threshold level is set to any of these values, the accidental counting probability
for the whole detector (64 channels) is over the desired limit level of 5 %. This 5 % was selected
considering that the overcounting must remain below the error value of the number of muons
reported in [24], see Figures 5, 8, and 11. At three SPE rate level, the environmental radiation starts
to dominate over the noise. For this level, the accidental counting probability (see equation 4.7) is
mainly due to the environmental radiation and fulﬁlls the requirement, therefore this is the selected
level for the threshold.

Figure 7. Measurement of the SiPM pulse rate with (red complete line) and without (blue dashed line) the
scintillating bar over the 10-bit DAC value. Each plateau represents the transition for diﬀerent amounts of
SPEs. The value marked with the 3SPElevel is the selected value for the threshold of the discriminator. All
the measurements were done at 25 ◦C and ∆V = 3.75 V.

As it was mentioned in subsection 4.1.2, the transition between plateaus in the SiPM rate as
a function of the 10-bit DAC value represents the threshold of the comparator passing through the
SPE peaks. Furthermore, as was mentioned in section 2, the amplitude of the signal generated
by multiple simultaneously ﬁred cells is directly proportional to the number of them. Therefore,
it is expected that: ∆SPE1−2 = ∆SPE2−3 = SPEpeak (see ﬁgure 7). In the example shown, the

– 12 –

obtained values were: ∆SPE1−2 = (32.0 ± 1.4); ∆SPE2−3 = (36.0 ± 1.4); SPEpeak = (34.0 ± 1.4)
(in arbitrary units).

The middle point of the transition from the second to the third SPE peaks (SPEpeak ∗ 2.5)
corresponds to the value that ensures the detection of signals with three or more SPEs (3SPElevel).
Considering the oﬀset (DClevel), this value can be calculated with the following equation:

3SPElevel = SPEpeak ∗ 2.5 + DClevel (cid:39) ((216.0 ± 1.0) − (182.0 ± 1.0)) ∗ 2.5 + (182.0 ± 1.0)

= (216.0 ± 1.0) ∗ 2.5 − (182.0 ± 1.0) ∗ 1.5 = 267.0 ± 2.9

(4.6)

As an example, in the case exempliﬁed in ﬁgure 7 the estimated SPEpeak was (34.0 ± 1.4) and
the DClevel was (182.0 ± 1.0). The calculated 3SPElevel value is indicated in the ﬁgure, and it
corresponds to the middle point of the third SPE plateau. The 3SPElevel must be estimated and set
individually for each channel.

To estimate the accidental counting probability (Paccident al−counting) three factors are taken
into account: the segmentation or number of strips (n), the acquired event time window (Tevent )
and the noise rate (Rnoise, i.e. the environmental radiation and dark rate). As an example, for the
AMIGA modules the segmentation is of 64 channels, the acquired event time window is 3.2 µs and
the noise rate in the underground laboratory is ∼100 Hz (this value is the rate corresponding to
3SPElevel in ﬁgure 7). With those values, the accidental counting probability for a 10 m2 module
was estimated to be:

Paccident al−counting = n · Tevent · Rnoise (cid:39) 64 · 3.2 µs · 100 Hz ≡ 2 %

(4.7)

which is below the desired level of 5 %. The eﬃciency will be studied in detail in section 5.

4.3 Proposed On-site Calibration

The electronics design enables calibration to be performed at the observatory site. To ensure its
long-term performance, both calibrations detailed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 will be applied regularly
and automatically. Each module will acquire the calibration data locally and then transmit it to a
dedicated calibration server that will be running in the Central Data Acquisition System (CDAS)
of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The calibration server will carry out the SiPM calibration as well
as the detector calibration. This dedicated server will do the calculations to set three groups of
parameters: the HV value, the 8-bit DAC to equalize the channels, and the 10-bit DAC value to
set the discrimination level. All the calibration data and the parameters obtained will be stored for
long-term stability studies.

5 Counting Eﬃciency Measurements

As mentioned in section 1, the module must count eﬃciently the number of impinging muons.
To test its eﬃciency, the setup described in subsection 4.2.1 was used. Several measurements at
diﬀerent ﬁber lengths were taken using the muon telescope. Every time there is a muon telescope
trigger (event), the acquisition system (see sixth stage of section 4.2.1) stores the discriminated
signal of the CITIROC (digital trace) and the ampliﬁed analog signal of the SiPM (analog trace).

– 13 –

From the ampliﬁed analog traces, the voltage amplitude peak and charge (integral of the
current) of each pulse were obtained by an oﬄine analysis. The charge was numerically calculated
integrating the voltage signal trace, in a time window of 200 ns, divided by the oscilloscope input
impedance value (50 Ω). A histogram illustrating the voltage amplitude peak and charge of the
analog traces obtained at a ﬁber distance of 430 cm with the S13081-050CS SiPM is shown in
ﬁgure 8. Two colored areas can be distinguished in each histogram. The red area represents the
events that do not have a corresponding positive digital trace of the CITIROC. This means that no
particle was detected by the counting system. The green area represents all the events that have a
positive digital trace.

Figure 8. In the left (right) plot, the voltage amplitude peak (charge) histogram of 1000 triggered muon
events is shown. The red colored area corresponds to the events that do not have a positive digital trace. All
the measurements were done at 25 ◦C, ∆V = 3.75 V, and with the muon telescope placed at 430 cm of ﬁber
from the SiPM.

Figure 9. Both plots show the relationship between the voltage amplitude peak and the charge of 1000
triggered muon events. The red colored points correspond to events that do not have a digital output. In
the left (right) plot the muon telescope was placed at 430 cm (130 cm) of ﬁber. Isolated red points in the
lower left corner in the right ﬁgure evidence the false coincidences of the muon telescope trigger. All the
measurements were done at 25 ◦C and ∆V = 3.75 V.

Both plots in ﬁgure 9 show a correlation between the voltage amplitude peak and charge of
SiPM signals. In these plots there is a discrimination between the traces with (blue) or without

– 14 –

(red) digital output. In the left plot, the results with the muon telescope placed at 430 cm of ﬁber
are shown, and in the right one, the muon telescope was moved to 130 cm. As expected, the data
sets have higher mean voltage amplitude and charge values due to a decrease in the light attenuation
of the ﬁber.

In ﬁgure 10, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the digital output pulse of the
CITIROC, acquired with the oscilloscope at two ﬁber distances measured is shown. As it was
pointed out in the requirements, 99 % of the digital widths are lower than 35 ns. This requirement
was achieved by the fast shaper included in the CITIROC. There was no evidence of afterpulses in
the observed digital output.

Figure 10. Both plots show the width histogram of 1000 digital output pulses of the CITIROC. The red
colored bar corresponds to the traces that do not have a digital output pulse. In the left (right) plot the muon
telescope was placed at 430 cm (130 cm) of ﬁber. All the measurements were done at 25 ◦C and ∆V = 3.75 V.

Figure 11. Number of detected photons per muon impinging the detector as a function of the ﬁber distance
for two diﬀerent overvoltages: ∆V = 3 V and ∆V = 3.75 V. The detector light yield is not uniform due to the
ﬁber attenuation. Error bars are only due to statistic errors of the mean. All the measurements were done at
25 ◦C.

– 15 –

In ﬁgure 11, the mean value of the number of detected photons per muon impinging the detector
as a function of the ﬁber distance is shown. This mean value was obtained as the mean value of
the distribution of the ratio between the charge of measured traces and the mean charge of the SPE.
Error bars are only due to statistic errors of the mean. This light yield curve was obtained with
the setup shown in Figure 6. The muon telescope trigger selects mainly vertical muons and the
acceptance angle considering the muon telescope geometry is ∼ 35 ◦. There are two main factors
that constrain the performance of the detector since its light yield is not uniform due to the ﬁber
attenuation.
In the farther distances, the eﬃciency strongly depends on the threshold selection,
since the attenuation of the optical ﬁber signiﬁcantly decreases the number of photons that arrive to
the SiPM. At the closest distances, the number of detected photons is higher and the digital width
is consequently increased. The selected pre-ampliﬁer gain, i.e. high-gain pre-ampliﬁer set to the
lowest gain, combined with the fast shaper ensures an adequate width of the digital output.

5.1 Eﬃciency Results and Possible Improvements

The counting eﬃciency is deﬁned as the ratio between the amount of positive digital output traces
of the CITIROC, and the number of triggers of the muon telescope that ensures a particle passing
through the scintillating bar at a certain distance.

Figure 12 summarizes the results of the eﬃciency for eight diﬀerent distances and for two
diﬀerent overvoltages. Two kind of errors are included in the plot. Vertical lines represent statistic
errors assuming a binomial distribution and brackets represent the systematic errors caused by
false triggers.
It should be pointed out that the eﬃciency study was performed with the setup
shown in Figure 6. The muon telescope trigger selects mainly vertical muons, the acceptance angle
considering the muon telescope geometry is ∼ 35 ◦.

Figure 12. Eﬃciency measurements for two diﬀerent ∆V are compared. A larger ∆V produces an increase
in the eﬃciency. The estimated integrated eﬃciency is: 97 % for ∆V = 3 V (red) and 98 % for ∆V = 3.75 V
(blue). Vertical lines represent statistic errors assuming a binomial distribution and brackets represent the
systematics errors caused by false triggers.

A higher eﬃciency is achieved when the ∆V is increased, since the PDE of the SiPM rises with
the increment of the ∆V. With the increment of the ∆V, the noise is also increased. For the higher
∆V, the accidental counting probability is ∼2 % (see section 4.2.2).

– 16 –

Although the eﬃciency has a dependence with the distance, one important parameter that
should be calculated is the integrated eﬃciency over the whole scintillating bar. For the two cases
exempliﬁed in ﬁgure 12, the estimated integrated eﬃciency is: 97 % for ∆V = 3 V and 98 % for
∆V = 3.75 V.

6 Conclusions

A new readout for the AMIGA muon counters was proposed. The selected SiPM was the S13081-
050CS due to its low crosstalk and afterpulsing. The CITIROC ASIC was selected as the electronics
front-end. Its fast shaper enables a digital output width of the discriminator similar to the char-
acteristic time width of the light pulses produced by the impinging particles in the detector. The
Hamamatsu C11204-01 power supply was chosen for the biasing of the SiPMs.

The proposed calibration method consists of two steps. Firstly, the SiPM calibration allows
the individual characterization of each SiPM of the module and the equalization between channels.
Secondly, the detector calibration determines the discrimination level and the counting strategy.
Both calibrations combined guarantee the performance of the detector by an adequate overvoltage
and threshold level selection. Both methods were designed to be performed on the Observatory
site. This allows studying the long-term performance of the detector, improving its stability for
long periods.

Laboratory eﬃciency studies show promising results. The high integrated eﬃciency obtained
(98 % for the higher tested overvoltage) combined with a low probability of accidental counting
(∼2 %) evidences an adequate performance of the proposed counting system.
