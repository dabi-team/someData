Fans in the Theory of Real Semigroups
I. Algebraic Theory

Abstract

In [DP1] we introduced the notion of a real semigroup (RS) as an axiomatic framework to
study diagonal quadratic forms with arbitrary entries over (commutative, unitary) semi-real
rings. (For the axioms of RS, cf. 1.7.) Two important classes of RSs were studied at length
in [DP2], [DP3]. In this paper we introduce and develop the algebraic theory of RS-fans, a
third class of RSs providing a vast generalization of homonymous notions previously existing
in ﬁeld theory and in the theories of abstract order spaces and of reduced special groups;
for a background on fans, see paragraph A of the Introduction, below. The contents of this
paper are brieﬂy reviewed in paragraph B of the Introduction. The combinatorial theory
of the structures dual to RS-fans, called ARS-fans, is the subject of [DP5b], a continuation
of the present paper.

Introduction

In [DP1] we introduced the notion of a real semigroup (henceforth abbreviated RS), an ax-
iomatic framework aimed at studying diagonal quadratic forms with arbitrary entries over
commutative, unitary rings 1 admitting a minimum of orderability. 2 For ready reference we
have included below the axioms deﬁning RSs (1.7) and their underlying structures, the ternary
semigroups (abbreviated TS, see 1.1). The basic properties of these structures are proved in
[DP1],
2, pp. 57-59. We also proved ([DP1], Thm. 4.1, p. 115)
that the RSs are categorically dual to the abstract real spectra (ARS), previously introduced in
[M], Chs. 6 – 9, with a similar goal.

§

In [DP2], [DP3] we introduced and studied two outstanding classes of RSs, the Post alge-
bras and the spectral real semigroups, and their dual ARSs. The aim of this paper and its
continuation [DP5b] is to present a third natural class of RSs (and their dual ARSs), namely
fans, and develop their theory.

A. Background on fans. Fans were introduced by Becker and K¨opping [BK] 3 as a
distinguished class of preorders in ﬁelds, and further investigated by several authors. Chapter
5 of the monograph [La] gives a quite complete picture of the role of fans in the context of
ﬁelds, and contains many bibliographical references.

A further step was taken by Marshall, see [M], Ch. 3, who generalized the notion of a fan to
the context of abstract spaces of orderings (AOS), an axiomatic framework extending the ﬁeld
case. In [Li] (see also [DM1], Ex. 1.7, pp. 8-9, and pp. 89-90) this notion was treated in the
framework of reduced special groups (RSG), and its functorial duality with the corresponding
notion of fan in the category of AOSs proved.

1 In this paper simply referred to as rings.
2 Namely, having a non-empty real spectrum or, equivalently, that −1 is not a sum of squares.
3 See [ABR], p. 84, and [La], Notes on § 5, p. 48.

Fans surfaced again in [ABR], Chs. 3, 5, under the still more general clothing of spaces of
signs, a framework equivalent to that of ARSs. This book extensively witnesses the key role
that fans play in real algebraic and real analytic geometry; see, e.g., [ABR], Thms. IV.7.3 and
V.1.4 (the “generation formulae”), and [AR], pp. 1-7, where further references can be found.
However, the notion of a fan used in [ABR] (cf. Def. 3.12, p. 75) is that of an AOS-fan suitably
embedded in an ARS; see also [M], p. 162.

A suﬃciently general and intrinsic notion of fan in the categories of ARSs and of RSs 4
does not exist at present. The aim of this paper and its continuation [DP5b], is to present
and study such a notion. The key leading to this goal consists in bringing into play the
(enriched) semigroup structures underlying the real semigroups, namely the ternary semigroups
([DP1], Def. 1.1, p. 100; see also 1.1 below). This task is not a straightforward extrapolation
of the situation in the categories RSG and AOS, on two accounts. Firstly, owing to the
rather complex algebraic and topological structure of the TSs, far more involved than the
(trivial) structures underlying the RSGs (namely groups of exponent 2 with a distinguished
element
1). Secondly, because the natural topology on ARSs is spectral —i.e., has non-trivial
specialization— while the corresponding topology on AOSs is Boolean, and therefore has a
trivial specialization order. While the ﬁrst of these factors plays a central role in the present
paper, the second will be crucial in its sequel, [DP5b], where we develop the combinatorial
theory of ARS-fans.

−

To motivate the main ideas presented in this paper, we begin by brieﬂy reviewing the
deﬁnition of a fan in the (dual) categories AOS and RSG (for more details, see [M], Ch. 3;
[Li], Ex. 1.1.6, pp. 30-31; [DM1], Ex. 1.7, pp. 8-9).
— A fan in the category AOS (henceforth called an AOS-fan) is an abstract space of orders
(X, G) where “X is biggest possible”; there are two equivalent ways of making sense of this
idea :
(1) X consists of all group homomorphisms h : G

such that h(

1) =

1.

−→ { ±

1
}

−

−

(2) (X, G) is an AOS and X is closed under the product of any three of its members.
— A fan in the category RSG (henceforth an RSG-fan) is a reduced special group G whose
binary representation relation is “smallest posible”; there is only one way of making sense of
this:

c and a

Remarks 0.1 (a) While condition (1) above implies that (X, G) is an AOS, the last require-
ment in (2) alone is not suﬃcient to guarantee that (X, G) is an AOS; in addition, one must
require that:
(i) X separates points in G, i.e.,

σ∈X ker(σ) =

T

⊆

ker(σ), then σ

(ii) X veriﬁes the following maximality condition (see [M], axiom [AX2] for AOSs, p. 22):
for every group homomorphism σ : G
DX (a, b)
(b) The deﬁnition of binary representation given by condition [RSG-fan] above (together with
1
1) implies that G is a RSG ([Li], Prop. 1.1.14, pp. 34-36). Thus, every non-trivial group
of exponent 2 is endowed with a structure of RSG. This is not the case for ternary semigroups,
where an additional condition (called condition [Z]) ought to be satisﬁed for a TS to be endowed
✷
with a structure of RS, cf. Fact 1.4, Proposition 1.6 and Theorem 3.4.

We deﬁne the notion of a fan in the category ARS of abstract real spectra by postulating
the analogs of conditions (1) and (2) above, upon replacing the underlying notion of a group of

X = Hom
(2) (X, G) is a fan2 iﬀ it is an ARS and X is closed under the product of any three of its
members.
We shall frequently use in the sequel the following weaker notion to which we give a name:

Remarks 0.3 (a) The set 3 =
under obvious operations has a unique structure
of TS. In fact, endowed with suitable ternary representation and transversal representation
relations, see 1.8, it has a unique structure of RS. It obviously is a fan1.
(b) In 0.2 (2) we allow products of type h2
1h2; as opposed to the case of special groups, squaring
a TS-homomorphism does not produce a map constantly equal to 1. Note also that h3 = h,
and that the product of any three TS-homomorphisms is again a TS-homomorphism.

(G, 3) is closed

under product of any three members, and separates points in G by the separation theorem for

B. Contents of the paper.
In Section 1 we include for ready reference the axioms deﬁning ternary semigroups (1.1) and
real semigroups (1.7), as well as the basic example 1.8. Other than these, the section reviews
brieﬂy some algebraic and topological notions and results used throughout the paper which do
not appear in print elsewhere.

§

In

2 we prove (Theorem 2.3) that the ternary representation relation induced on any TS
by a non-empty set of TS-characters separating points, automatically satisﬁes all axioms for
real semigroups with the exception of the strong associativity axiom [RS3], see Deﬁnition 1.7.

§

In

3 we give a purely algebraic characterization of the representation and the transversal
representation relations naturally occurring in a q-fan satisfying condition [Z] (Theorem 3.1).
We also show that any ternary semigroup endowed with a ternary relation satisfying these
algebraic requirements is automatically a real semigroup (Theorem 3.4). A number of important
consequences follow from these results; notably

•

•

The identity of the two notions of fan deﬁned in 0.2 above (Proposition 3.5).

Various properties substantiating the fact that both representation relations in RS-fans are
“smallest possible” (Corollaries 3.7 – 3.10).

Section 4 gives a few examples of ﬁnite RS- and ARS-fans constructed from ternary semi-
groups on one and three generators. For each of these examples we draw the graph of the
representation partial order of the corresponding RS-fan (cf. Deﬁnition 1.10), and that of the
specialization root system of its dual ARS-fan. We prove that, under the representation partial
order, each RS-fan is a bounded lattice (not modular, in general), Theorem 4.5.

After a brief presentation of a general notion of congruence in real semigroups, in

5 we
prove that the class of RS-fans is closed under the formation of arbitrary quotients (Proposition

5.8), and that quotients of RS-fans by congruences deﬁned by ideals are (upon omitting zero)
fans in the category of reduced special groups (Proposition 5.11).

Section 6 contains a characterization of RS-fans in terms of specialization and quotients
(Theorem 6.1). It follows that certain geometric conﬁgurations of the character space of RSs
give rise to RS-fans (Corollaries 6.6 and 6.7).

§

In

7 we apply the theory previously developed to the real semigroups associated to pre-
ordered rings. Proposition 7.8 gives a characterization of the ternary semigroup characters of
the RS GA,T associated to a preordered ring
in terms of the algebraic operations of A
and the preorder T . This yields a natural extension of the original deﬁnition of fans by [BK]
[La], Def. 5.1, p. 39) to the context of rings and, hence, a characterization of those RSs
(cf.
(Proposition 7.10 (2)).

A total preorder T of a ring A is a (proper) preorder such that T

T = A. Theorem 7.21
proves that if T is either a total preorder of A or the intersection of two total preorders such
that the set of T -convex prime ideals of A is totally ordered under inclusion, then GA,T is a
RS-fan. This gives a ring-theoretic analog of the notion of a trivial fan, well-known in the ﬁeld
case ([La], Prop. 5.3, p. 39).

Remark. Contrary to the case of real semigroups ([M], Prop. 6.4.1, p. 114), the specialization
order of the character space of arbitrary ternary semigroups may not be a root system. A
counterexample is given in [DP1], Ex. 1.14, p. 105. However, it is a normal space in the usual

topological sense of this notion ([DP4], Prop. I.1.21).

axiom [RS3]. We register ([M], Prop. 6.1.1, p. 100, and Thm. 6.2.4, pp. 107-108) that [RS3]
is equivalent to the conjunction of the weak associativity axiom [RS3a] obtained by replacing
transversal representation by ordinary representation in [RS3] and

2 From ternary semigroups to real semigroups

In this short section we show that any non-empty set of TS-characters of a ternary semigroup
induces ternary relations that satisfy all RS-axioms except, possibly, the strong associativity
axiom [RS3] (cf. Deﬁnition 1.7).

§

3 Fans are real semigroups and abstract real spectra

Our main aim in this section is to prove that (ARS-)fans, in any of the two senses considered
in Deﬁnition 0.2, are abstract real spectra. The ﬁrst step to achieve this is to work out the
explicit form of the representation relations corresponding to the notion of “q-fan” (under the
assumption that the necessary condition in 1.4 is veriﬁed); this is done in Theorem 3.1.
It
follows that any TS verifying this necessary condition and endowed with the relations thus
obtained is a real semigroup (Theorem 3.4). A number of results (3.5 – 3.10) which determine
to a large extent the structure of RS-fans follow from these theorems.

Theorem 3.4 Let G be a ternary semigroup verifying condition [Z] of Theorem 3.1. With the

This result is a natural extension of [Li], Prop. 1.1.14 (see 0.1 (b)) to the theory of real semi-
groups.

Before engaging in the proof of these theorems we draw some important consequences of

them.

Since S

[DP1], Thm. 1.9, pp. 103–104, (X, G) is a q-fan 7. Since G satisﬁes condition [Z], Theorem
3.1 guarantees that the representation relation DX is given by the equality in 3.1 (b). Then,
Theorem 3.4 proves that (G, DX ) is a RS. By the equivalence of (2) and (4) in Corollary 3.8,
✷
its dual structure, (X, G), is an ARS; hence, (X, G) is a fan 2.
Deﬁnition and Notation 3.6 (Fan) Henceforth we simply write “fan” (or “ARS-fan”)
for either of the equivalent conditions fan1 or fan2. In using the notation “(X, G)

implicitly assume that the underlying ternary semigroup G veriﬁes condition [Z] in Theorem 3.1;
this assumption is crucial and, in fact, distinguishes fans from many other classes of ARSs. We
shall also say “G is a fan” (or a “RS-fan”), tacitly assuming that its representation relations
✷
are those given in Theorem 3.1.

Corollary 3.7 Let G be a TS verifying condition [Z] of Theorem 3.1. Let H be a real semi-
group, and let f : G
H be a homomorphism of ternary semigroups. Then, f preserves the
representation relation D deﬁned by clause [D] of 3.1, and hence it is a RS-homomorphism
from (G, D) into H. In other words, Hom

Proof. In view of the deﬁnition of D, the proof boils down to the following obvious facts:

4 Examples

With the aim of illustrating the notions introduced above, we present in this section some
examples of (alas, ﬁnite) fans based on ternary semigroups with up to three generators. For
each example we shall draw both the root-system of an ARS-fan ordered under specialization
and the representation partial order of its dual real semigroup.

In order to determine the representation partial order in the examples below, we will need

the following supplement to Theorem 1.11, valid in the case of fans.

Representation partial order of F1

The representation partial order of the real semigroup F1 —illustrated in Figure 1, right—
follows straightforwardly from Theorem 1.11 (2)–(4).

Remark. Barring the case where the generator x becomes invertible (i.e., x2 = 1, which
gives a four element RSG-fan with an added 0), the only possible additional relation is x2 = x,
which eliminates the character h3. Thus, we get the following diagrams for the specialization
order (left) and the representation order (right):

Example 4.2. B. Ternary semigroups on three generators.
Generators: x, y, z. Condition [Z] gives raise to the following possible relations:
1. x2 = y2 = z2. ( [Z] is automatically veriﬁed in this case.)
2. x2 = y2
The two identities obtained from the last clause give rise to non-isomorphic cases, and, upon
permutation, all cases where two of the three generators have equal squares (i.e., equal zero-sets)
are isomorphic to these.
3. x2, y2, z2 are pairwise diﬀerent, and x2y2
∈ {
A case-by-case analysis of all eight combinations of these values shows that, up to isomorphism
by permutation, the only surviving case is x2y2 = x2z2 = x2 and y2z2 = y2.

Routine checking shows that the following are all possible characters:
— h1 sends all three generators to 0;
— h2, h3 send x, y to 0 and, say, h2(z) = 1, h3(z) =
— h4, . . . , h11 assign to the generators all possible combinations of values
h4, . . . , h7 sending z to 1, and h8, . . . , h11 sending z to
Call F2 the TS corresponding to this case. Using Lemma 1.2 one sees at once that the

we describe the fan obtained from the preceding one by adding:
ii) The extra relation xz = x.

x, y,

F3 =

Under this relation, each character sending z to
1 must also send x to 0. Thus, the
characters h8, . . . , h11 in the preceding example disappear. Specialization among the remaining
characters does not change; the order of specialization of the resulting ARS is obtained by
omitting these characters in Figure 3. The resulting RS-fan is:
x2, z2,
1, x,

−
The diagram of its representation partial order is computed in much the same way as in the
preceding example; details are left to the reader.
iii) The relations xz = x and z2 = 1.
The additional relation z2 = 1 makes z invertible and hence excludes the character h1 sending
z to 0. This makes the characters h2 , h3 become “disconnected” (cf. [DP5b], Def. 2.14 (a));
we obtain a two-component root-system:

6 Characterizations of fans

The main result of this section is the following characterization of RS-fans:
Theorem 6.1 For a real semigroup G, the following are equivalent:
(1) G is a RS-fan.
(2) G satisﬁes the following conditions:

G (a2b2 = a2 or a2b2 = b2).

∀

(i)
a, b
(ii) Given g, h
g   h′.

XG

∈

such that Z(h) = Z(h′) and

(iii) For every saturated prime ideal I of G, the quotient reduced special group (GI , DGI

is a RSG-fan.

)

Remark. The implication (1)
(2.iii) is Proposition 5.11. Condition (2.i) is assumption [Z]
in the deﬁnition of a RS-fan (3.6); see also Fact 1.4 and Proposition 1.6. Therefore, to complete
(1), proved, respectively, in

Remark 6.5 (Chain length) There is a well-known characterization of fans in the categories
AOS and RSG in terms of chain length, i.e., the size of longest strict inclusion chain of non-
empty subbasic opens U (a), cf. proof of 3.13: an AOS is a fan if and only if its chain length
is
2, see [ABR], Prop. 3.11, p. 74, or [M], Thm. 4.2.1 (2), p. 65. This notion of chain
length also makes sense for ARSs, cf. [M], p. 167. However, this characterization is no longer
valid for ARSs or RSs; an easy computation shows that the RS-fan F2 in Example 4.2. B.(i),
see Figure 4, has chain length 4. With Spec (F ) denoting the set of ideals of F , the integer
card (Spec (F )) is an upper bound on the chain length of a RS-fan, F , with a ﬁnite spectrum;
2
✷
this is easily proved using Theorem 6.1; see also [M], Thm. 8.5.3, p. 167.

·

The next two corollaries of Theorem 6.1 give stylized (abstract) versions of the notion of a
trivial fan, a basic concept in the theory of (pre-)orders on ﬁelds (see [La], Prop. 5.3, p. 39).
Their translation in the case of preordered rings is given in Theorem 7.21 below, where it will
be obvious that in the case of ﬁelds they boil down to the notion of a trivial fan.

Corollary 6.6 Let G be a real semigroup such that the character space XG

h1 = h1. It follows that, for every saturated prime ideal I the quotient G/I

Corollary 7.12 Let K be a ﬁeld and T be a preorder of K which is a fan. Let A be a subring
of K whose ﬁeld of fractions is K. Then, the real semigroup GA,T ∩ A
is a fan. In particular, if
A = Av is the valuation ring of a T -compatible valuation v of K, the real semigroup GAv ,T ∩ Av
is a fan.

The following result proves two important properties of total preorders in rings:

Theorem 7.21 (i) Let T be a total preorder of a ring A. Then, the real semigroup GA,T
fan and Sper (A, T ) is totally ordered by specialization.
(ii) Let T0, T1

T1

Remark. In case the ring A is a ﬁeld, K, a total preorder is just a (total) order of K. Thus,
Theorem 7.21 is a ring-theoretic analog of the well-known fact that the intersection of at most
✷
two total orders of a ﬁeld is a fan, namely the trivial fans, cf. [La], Prop. 5.3, p. 39.

Proof. (i) By Corollary 6.6 it suﬃces to check that Sper (A, T ) (= XGA,T

(ii) We check that assumptions (1) – (3) of 6.7 are veriﬁed by GA,T .

Since the saturated prime ideals of GA,T are in a bijective, inclusion-preserving correspon-
dence with the T -convex prime ideals of A (cf. Fact 7.5), the argument proving Proposition
7.10 (2) shows that GA,T veriﬁes condition [Z] in Theorem 3.1, i.e., assumption 6.7 (1).

Assumption 6.7 (2) follows from the proof of (i) and:

In order to prove assumption (3) of 6.7 we ﬁrst show:

(**) Every T -convex prime ideal I of A is both T0-convex and T1-convex.
Proof of (**). From [BCR], Prop. 4.2.8 (ii), p. 87, we know that I is either T0-convex or
T1-convex. Assume, towards a contradiction, that I is T0-convex but not T1-convex. Then,
I. Since I is T -convex, we

T0-convexity yields
