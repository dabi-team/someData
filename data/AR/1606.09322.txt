ABSTRACT

Context. Flux ropes are composed of twisted magnetic ﬁelds, and connect closely with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Fan-spine
magnetic topology is another kind of complex magnetic ﬁelds. It has been reported by several authors, and is believed to be associated
with null-point-type magnetic reconnection.
Aims. We try to determine the number of ﬂux rope proxies and reveal fan-spine structures in a complex active region (AR) NOAA
11897.
Methods. Employing the high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS), we statistically investigate ﬂux rope proxies in NOAA AR 11897 from 14-Nov-2013 to 19-Nov-2013 and display
two fan-spine structures in this AR.
Results. For the ﬁrst time, we detect ﬂux rope proxies of NOAA 11897 for total 30 times in 4 diﬀerent locations during this AR’s
transference from solar east to west on the disk. Moreover, we notice that these ﬂux rope proxies were tracked by active or eruptive
material of ﬁlaments for 12 times while for the rest 18 times they appeared as brightening in the corona. These ﬂux rope proxies
were either tracked in both lower and higher temperature wavelengths or only detected in hot channels. Specially, none of these ﬂux
rope proxies was observed to erupt, but just faded away gradually. In addition to these ﬂux rope proxies, we ﬁrstly detect a secondary
fan-spine structure. It was covered by dome-shaped magnetic ﬁelds which belong to a larger fan-spine topology.
Conclusions. These new observations imply that considerable amounts of ﬂux ropes can exist in an AR and the complexity of AR
magnetic conﬁguration is far beyond our imagination.

1. Introduction

A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a large-scale eruption from
the solar atmosphere, releasing huge amounts of mass and mag-
netic ﬂux into the interplanetary space, and may severely aﬀect
the space environment around the earth (Gosling 1993; Webb
et al. 1994). As shown in coronagraph images, a CME gener-
ally presents a three-part structure: the bright front or leading
edge, the enclosed dark cavity, and the inner bright core (Illing &
Hundhausen 1983; Chen 2011). The magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR)
is a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines winding around a central axis,
whose existence could explain the dark cavity’s accumulating
magnetic energy and mass in a CME (Gibson et al. 2006; Riley
et al. 2008; Wang & Stenborg 2010). The MFR has been thought
to connect closely with a CME and almost all theoretical models
of CMEs require the presence or formation of a coronal MFR
(Forbes 2000). Thus, a complete research on the MFR is nec-
essary to obtain a clear understanding of CMEs, which will un-
doubtedly result in accurate forecasts of CMEs and associated
space weather.

MFR can be theoretically formed through two ways: bod-
ily ﬂux emergence from below the photosphere into the upper
atmosphere or magnetic reconnection of sheared arcades in the
corona. In the emergence model, a twisted MFR is assumed to
exist below the photosphere and then emerge into a pre-existing
coronal potential ﬁeld (Fan 2001, 2010; Manchester et al. 2004;

Magara 2006). Okamoto et al. (2008) found that two opposite
polarity regions connected by vertically weak but horizontally
strong magnetic ﬁeld ﬁrst grew laterally and then narrowed. And
the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld changed its orientation accompany-
ing by a signiﬁcant blueshift. As a result, they suggested that a
MFR emerging from below the photosphere had been observed.
It’s worth to mention that Vargas Domínguez et al. (2012) in-
terpreted the same observation as a result of photospheric mag-
netic cancellation instead of ﬂux emergence. In the reconnec-
tion model, magnetic reconnection between two bundles of op-
posite J-shaped loops which have been frequently observed as
the sigmoidal structure in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-
ray lines is able to form the MFR (Canﬁeld et al. 1999; McKen-
zie & Canﬁeld 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Green et al. 2011). And a
related possible original mechanism is that the MFR is built up
and heated by the magnetic reconnection in the quasi-separatrix
layers (Guo et al. 2013).

Considerable eﬀorts have also been made in numerical sim-
ulations to study the formation and dynamic behavior of MFRs
(Forbes & Priest 1995; Lin et al. 1998; Aulanier et al. 2010).
Amari et al. (2000, 2003) simulated the evolution of a MFR
and found that a slow converging motion of the ﬁeld lines’ foot-
points toward the polarity inversion line helps to produce a MFR
through magnetic reconnection. Török & Kliem (2003, 2005)
studied the instability of a MFR and found that the kink and/or

torus instability of the MFR can trigger a CME. Olmedo &
Zhang (2010) made a more detailed study and proposed that the
eruption of the MFR can be fully driven by a partial torus in-
stability. Furthermore, setting the observed photospheric vector
magnetic ﬁeld as the bottom boundary, nonlinear force-free ﬁeld
extrapolation method was applied to reconstruct the topology of
MFR in the corona (Canou et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2010; Jiang et
al. 2013).

Direct observations of MFRs have been reported with the
help of multi-wavelength observations from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the So-
lar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). MFRs are
usually detected in higher temperature passbands, such as 94 Å
and 131 Å (Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2013). Furthermore,
MFRs sometimes appear one by one in the same region with a
similar morphology, which are named as homologous ﬂux ropes
(Li & Zhang 2013b). Li & Zhang (2013a) and Yang et al. (2014)
reported that the ﬁne-scale structures of MFRs can be tracked by
erupting material once in a while and could be observed in both
higher and lower temperature channels.

Despite a large amount of research on the ﬂux rope, the sta-
tistical investigation is rare. Recently, Zhang et al. (2015) have
counted the number of the ﬂux rope proxies over the visible so-
lar disk from 2013 January to 2013 December and pointed out
that in some particularly active regions, many ﬂux rope proxies
were detected, which showed some clustering. Our study mainly
concerns ﬂux rope proxies in NOAA 11897 and ﬁgures out the
locations and number of ﬂux rope proxies during the AR’s evo-
lution from 14-Nov-2013 to 19-Nov-2013. When we observe a
set of EUV loops which collectively wind around a central and
axial line, we consider them as a ﬂux rope proxy. Besides the sta-
tistical results, four examples of these ﬂux rope proxies and two
fan-spine structures are displayed. Fan-spine magnetic topology
is another kind of complex ﬁelds and has been proposed by sev-
eral authors (Wang & Liu 2012; Sun et al. 2013). The fan-spine
magnetic topology is believed to play a crucial role in solar ex-
plosive events and direct observations of such a structure has
been rare.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2
contains the observations and data analysis used for our study.
The distribution of the ﬂux rope proxies in NOAA 11897, four
typical cases, and two fan-spine structures are presented in sec-
tion 3. Finally, we conclude this work and discuss the results in
section 4.

2. Observations and data analysis

The AIA on board SDO observes the multi-layered solar atmo-
sphere, including photosphere, chromosphere, transition region,
and corona in 10 (E)UV passbands with a cadence of 12 s and a
spatial sampling of 0.′′6 pixel−1, among which the 131 Å channel
shows ﬂux rope best. Thus we focus on 131 Å in this study while
the 171 Å and 304 Å channels’ observations are also presented.
In order to study the relationship between the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁelds of the AR and the ﬂux rope proxies’ locations, line
of sight (LOS) magnetograms from SDO/Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) with a time cadence of 45
s and a pixel size of 0.′′5 are used as well. Since it’s diﬃcult to
exclude the possibility that some polarity was produced by the
projection eﬀect when the NOAA AR 11897 was located close
to the solar limb, we adopt the observations from 2013 Novem-
ber 14 to 19 when this AR kept distance away from the limbs.

Moreover, two series of the Interface Region Imaging Spec-
trograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014) slit-jaw 1400 Å images
(SJIs) are adopted as well, which are all Level 2 data. The 1400
Å channel contains emission from the Si IV 1394/1403 Å lines
that are formed in lower transition region. On 2013 November
14, the SJIs in 1400 Å focused on NOAA 11897 were taken from
20:09 UT to 20:35 UT with a pixel scale of 0.′′166, a cadence of
10 s and a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 119′′ × 119′′. On November
17, the 1400 Å SJIs focused on the same AR were obtained from
12:58 UT to 13:47 UT with a FOV of 167′′ × 174′′, and the same
cadence and pixel size as on November 14.

3. Results

3.1. Overview of the observed ﬂux rope proxies

During the evolution of NOAA 11897 from 2013 November 14
to 19, we identify ﬂux rope proxies for 30 times in 4 diﬀerent
locations by using coordinated observations from the SDO and
the IRIS. The locations and general morphologies of these prox-
ies are shown in Fig. 1 and the daily distribution is summarized
in Table 1. The morphologies of some proxies in one location
may change slowly with the evolution of the underlying mag-
netic ﬁeld (see movie 1), but we just classify these ﬂux rope
proxies into the same location by tracing their footpoints’ mo-
tion. According to our observations, some ﬂux rope proxies can
be detected in all seven EUV channels (304 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å,
211 Å, 335 Å, 94 Å, and 131 Å) that cover the temperatures from
0.05 MK to 20 MK while the others could only be observed in
hot channels such as 94 Å and 131 Å. As a result, we roughly
classify these proxies into two types. To distinguish them, we
take the blue and red solid curves to outline these two kinds of
ﬂux rope proxies’s locations in Fig. 1, respectively. In the fol-
lowing part, we choose four typical samples to investigate these
ﬂux rope proxies in detail. The ﬁrst two proxies can be observed
in both lower and higher temperature lines, and the latter two can
be only detected in higher temperature lines.

3.2. Two ﬂux rope proxies detected in both lowerand higher

temperature wavelengths

A ﬂux rope proxy on 2013 November 14 in L1 of Fig. 1(a) was
selected and shown in Fig. 2, which was associated with a ﬁla-
ment activation (see movie 2). This ﬁlament was located along
the neutral line of NOAA 11897 (see panel (c)) and the rope
proxy was brightened by the ﬁlament’s active material in both
lower and higher temperature channels around 20:13 UT (panels
(a)-(b)). In IRIS 1400 Å channel, we can observe the brightening
of this rope proxy clearly (panels (d)-(f)). At 20:10 UT, the emis-
sion at southeast end of this rope proxy was enhanced, which
may result from the underneath magnetic ﬂux cancellation (see
panel (c)). And the twisted structures were observed due to this
brightening (see panel (g)). Then the brightening propagated to
the north end and traced the whole ﬂux rope proxy at 20:15 UT
(see panels (e)-(f)). Some local twisted structures were shown in
panels (h)-(i). By examining the ﬁne-scale twisted structures in
this ﬂux rope proxy, we roughly estimate that the twist number
of this proxy is about 4 π. From 20:15 UT to 20:18 UT, a rota-
tion motion of the rope was observed (see movie 2), which can
be identiﬁed as the unwinding motion of the twisted magnetic
ﬁeld lines (Yan et al. 2014). Meanwhile, the brightening mate-
rial moved bi-directionally along the rope proxy. Later, a rotation

detected ﬂux rope proxies in the AR from 2013 November 14 to 19. The red curves mean that the ﬂux rope proxies on these locations can be
detected only in hot EUV passbands, for example, 131 Å, while the blue curves mean that the proxies on these locations can be detected both
in hot and cooler EUV passbands, such as 131 Å, 171 Å, and 304 Å. The temporal evolution of the LOS magnetograms is available as a movie

motion was detected once again around the southeast end of this
rope proxy from 20:20 UT to 20:23 UT.

Another ﬂux rope proxy that was observed in both lower and
higher temperature wavelengths was located at another polarity
inversion line of NOAA 11897 (see L3 in Fig. 1(b)) on 2013
November 17 (see movie 3). Similar to the ﬁrst ﬂux rope proxy,
the rope proxy shown in Fig. 3 was related to a ﬁlament as well.
Around 10:16 UT, the ﬁlament was initially disturbed and ac-
companied by EUV brightening (panel (a)). Then the brighten-
ing material moved bi-directionally along the neutral line (panel
(b)) and 10 minutes later, a sigmoid ﬂux rope proxy appeared
in both lower and higher temperature wavelengths (see panels
(c)-(e)). Twisted structures (see arrows in panels (a)-(c)) were
tracked by the brightening material in both lower and higher tem-
perature channels. The twist number of this proxy is estimated
as 2 π. At 10:22 UT, this rope proxy was entirely traced out and
the EUV emission of its southeast end was strengthened after the
arrival of brightening materials. After that, the rope proxy’s spa-
tial scale decreased gradually as well as the EUV intensity till
the proxy’s completely vanishing at 10:38 UT. Nearly the whole
of this rope proxy was similar in diﬀerent channels except that
the north part of the proxy could only be detected in hot channel
(see panels (c)-(e)). Checking the HMI LOS magnetogram, we

ﬁnd that the northwest end of the ﬂux rope proxy was rooted in
the positive ﬁelds while the southeast end in negative ﬁelds (see
panel (f)).

3.3. Two ﬂux rope proxies detected only in the higher

temperature wavelengths

Besides the ﬂux rope proxies detected in both lower and higher
temperature channels, some rope proxies could be detected only
in hot lines. The ﬁrst case took place on 2013 November 14 in L2
of Fig. 1(a) and was shown in Fig. 4. In this case, the ﬂux rope
proxy was initiated by a partial eruption of a ﬁlament (see movie
4) and the ﬂux cancellation underlying this proxy was observed
as well (panels (d) and (e)). At 10:55 UT, brightening ﬁlament
material appeared in both 304 Å and 131 Å channels (panel (a)).
But during the following ten minutes, the brightening material
moved along the two directions of the ﬁlament channel track-
ing the rope proxy (panel (b)) only in 131 Å passband. And the
twisted structures (see arrows in panels (b)-(c)) were tracked by
the brightening material in hot channel as well. Here we estimate
that this proxy’s twist number is about 2 π. The rope proxy was
well developed at 11:06 UT (panel (c)) and faded away about
20 minutes later. In the lower temperature line (e.g., 304 Å), we

brightening footpoints (see arrow in panel (f)).

Another ﬂux rope proxy of this kind was observed on 2013
November 15 in L4 of Fig. 1(b) (see movie 5). This rope proxy
was initiated by a failed eruption of a ﬁlament (see Fig. 5(a)). In
131 Å channel, the ﬁlament material began to brighten at 11:32
UT. Then the brightening material moved to the southeast and
tracked the rope proxy in the following ten minutes (panel (b)),
which was accompanied by a C7.6 ﬂare. The arrows in panels
(b)-(c) point out the twist of this proxy and we estimate that
the twist number is about π. At 11:42 UT, the rope proxy was
well developed (panel (c)). Then the brightening material moved
back to ﬁlament again, and the rope proxy faded away ten min-
utes later. We outline the general shapes of the proxy and the
ﬁlament in panel (d), which show the ﬁlament’s position relative
to the proxy. Similar to the example shown in Fig. 4, this rope
proxy’s main body cannot be detected in the lower temperature
wavelengths, such as 171 Å and 304 Å (see panels (e) and (f)).

3.4. Two fan-spine structures

In NOAA 11897, we also detected two fan-spine structures in ad-
dition to those ﬂux rope proxies shown above. The ﬁrst structure
was observed on 2013 November 18 (see movie 6). At 04:10 UT,
a quasi-circular ribbon, whose radius was about 20 Mm, began to
brighten in 131 Å, 171 Å, and 304 Å channels. Subsequently, the
bright thread-like structures in 131 Å wavelength appeared and
composed a twisted loop bundle with its eastern end connecting
to the circular ribbon while the other end to the remote bright-

ening region (see Figs. 6(a)-(c)). Thus a dome-shaped structure
formed and covered the quasi-circular ribbon. Then the dome
and the loop bundle composed an obvious fan-spine conﬁgu-
ration. This event was accompanied by a C2.8 ﬂare. However,
the fan-spine conﬁguration could not be observed in the lower
temperature lines, such as 171 Å and 304 Å (see panels (d)
and (e)). As a result, we suggest that plasma ﬁlled in the fan-
spine structure is pretty hot and exactly above 10 MK (Sun et al.
2013). The circular ribbon corresponded to the intersection of
a fan surface with the photosphere and it was observed in both

along the circular ribbon and the shuﬄing motion within the hot
loop bundle were clearly observed. At about 04:40 UT, the bright
ribbon faded away and the fan-spine conﬁguration disappeared
later at 04:50 UT. Putting sight on the evolution of the under-
neath magnetic ﬁelds (see movie 1), we notice that a new dipole
emerged around 04:30 UT on November 16 (see the orange re-
gion in panel (g)) at the location of the circular ribbon, which
was about two days prior to the fan-spine structure’s appearance
(see the green region in panel (g)). Then the negative polarity
of this new dipole integrated into pre-existing ambient negative
ﬁelds on the east side while the positive part kept growing, which
was surrounded by the negative ﬁelds in the end. Rapid magnetic
ﬂux cancellation occurred successively between the new positive
ﬁeld and the surrounding negative ﬁelds. During the cancellation
process, the fan-spine structure brightened again at about 16:00
UT (see the blue region in panel (g)) and a C2.6 ﬂare was de-
tected simultaneously. By comparing the AIA 131 Å image and
HMI LOS magnetogram, we found that the quasi-circular ribbon
lay on the surrounding negative ﬁelds and the fan-spine structure
connected this ribbon to remote positive ﬁelds (see panels (c) and
(f)).

To study the ﬁne structures of this fan-spine structure, we
employed the IRIS 1400 Å data and compared them with cor-
responding SDO HMI LOS magnetogram and AIA 131 Å im-
age (see Fig. 7). Although the 1400 Å observations only covered
the period from 12:58 UT to 13:47 UT on November 17, they
ﬁrstly revealed a secondary fan-spine structure (see movie 7).
The quasi-circle ribbon was clear in 1400 Å channel and we no-
ticed that it was rooted in the surrounding negative ﬁelds (see the
yellow dashed lines in panels (a) and (c)). Inside of this ribbon,
we detected a smaller quasi-circle ribbon with a radius of about
6.4 Mm, which lay on the inner ring of positive magnetic ﬁelds
with negative ﬁelds inside (see the blue dashed lines in panels (a)
and (c)). Moreover, a secondary fan-spine conﬁguration above
this smaller circular ribbon was observed in both 131 Å and 1400

Å wavelengths (see the green squares in panels (a)-(c)). In panels
(d)-(f), 1400 Å images are zoomed to show the secondary fan-
spine conﬁguration. Similar to the structure shown in Fig. 6, this
fan-spine structure connected the smaller quasi-circle brighten-
ing ribbon to remote negative ﬁelds near the outer ribbon, which
formed a nested dome shape. During the evolution of this fan-
spine structure, a bidirectional ﬂow was observed as well. The
ﬂow towards southeast is marked by tracing brightening plas-
moids, whose projected velocities was around 114 km s−1 (see
the black triangles in panels (d)-(f)).

The second fan-spine structure was observed on 2013
November 16 (see movie 8). At about 07:57 UT, a set of loops
began to brighten in 131 Å passband, which connected a quasi-
circle ribbon to a remote brightening ribbon (see Fig. 8(a)). Then
the fan-spine structure was traced out clearly. Moreover, a se-
quential brightening of the circular ribbon and an apparent shuf-
ﬂing motion within the hot loop bundle were detected, which
have also been noticed in the ﬁrst case. But in the lower tem-
perature channels, we could only see the quasi-circle ribbon and
remote brightening ribbon (see panels (e) and (f)). At 08:15 UT,
the fan-spine structure was well developed (see panel (b)). After
that, the emission of the loops in 131 Å channel began to weaken.
But at about 08:35 UT, the brightening loops appeared in 171 Å
and 304 Å channels. We suggest that the brightening loops ap-
pearing in 171 Å and 304 Å channels were previous loops in
the 131 Å channel which had underwent a cooling process. Near
09:35 UT, this fan-spine structure disappeared. Investigating the
evolution of the underneath magnetic ﬁelds (see movie 1), we
ﬁnd that negative ﬁelds emerged near the quasi-circle ribbon’s
location, which was surrounded by positive ﬁelds, at about 22:00
UT on November 14. It’s similar to the case on November 18
that the opposite ﬁeld’s emergence happened several days ear-
lier than the fan-spine structure’s appearance at the quasi-circle
ribbon’s location. Moreover, the quasi-circular ribbon lay on the
surrounding positive ﬁelds and the fan-spine structure connected
the ribbon to remote negative ﬁelds (see panel (d)).

Employing high-resolution observations from the SDO and the
IRIS, we statistically investigate ﬂux rope proxies in the NOAA
11897 from 2013 November 14 to 2013 November 19. For the
ﬁrst time, we detect ﬂux rope proxies for 30 times in NOAA
11897 in 4 diﬀerent locations during 6 days, that is, 5 times per
day on average. In this work, we illuminate that ﬂux rope proxies
could appear frequently and be distributed in diﬀerent locations
in an AR. Lites (2005) speculated that ﬂux ropes might be rather
common in normal active regions, which is veriﬁed by our ob-
servations here. And specially, we exhibit two ﬂux rope proxies
tracked in both lower and higher temperature wavelengths and
two brightening rope proxies detected only in hot channels. For
more convincing judgement of these four ﬂux rope proxies, we
have roughly estimated their twist numbers. By examining the
ﬁne-scale twisted structures of the ﬂux rope proxy in Fig. 2, we
estimate that the twist number of this proxy is about 4 π, i.e.,
2 π is detected in Fig. 2(g), π in Fig. 2(h), and π in Fig. 2(i).
As some twisted structures of this proxy cannot be detected, the
twist number 4 π may be considered as a lower limit. In the late
stage of this proxy’s evolution, two rotation motions were de-
tected successively. Combining the fact that the minimum twist
number (4 π) of this proxy is above the critical value (2.5 π∼3.5
π; Hood & Priest 1981), we suggest that kink instability possibly
took place in this event and the rotation was obviously the un-
winding motion of the twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines. As a result,
the ﬂux rope proxy disappeared in this location (L1) after the ro-
tation motions. For the ﬂux rope proxies in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig.
5, no rotation motions took place and their twist numbers have
no great changes. So we just estimate an average lower limit of
the twist number for each proxy, which are 2 π, 2 π and π, re-
spectively. Some authors consider a full turn to be the qualifying
property (e.g., Liu et al. 2016), but others consider a half turn to
be suﬃcient (e.g., Chintzoglou et al. 2015). Our results in this
work are consistent with the study of Chintzoglou et al. (2015)
who considered a half turn (π) to be suﬃcient for judging a ﬂux
rope, as all the four ﬂux rope proxies satisfy such a standard. In
addition to these ﬂux rope proxies, we report on two fan-spine
structures in detail.

It is worth mentioning that these 4 locations were not in-
variant all the time but moved or got deformed slowly with the
evolution of the underlying magnetic ﬁelds. Tracing the ends of
two ﬂux rope proxies through HMI LOS magnetograms, we de-
cide to classify them into the same location if these two ropes’s
both ends are in the same regions, otherwise we determine them
as two diﬀerent locations. Furthermore, in two locations (L2 and
L4 in Fig. 1) of the four ones, ﬂux rope proxies could only be
detected in higher temperature wavelengths (Cheng et al. 2011;
Zhang et al. 2012) while ﬂux rope proxies in the rest two lo-
cations (L1 and L3 in Fig. 1) have both lower and higher tem-
perature components (Li & Zhang 2013). In NOAA 11897, the
ﬂux rope proxies which can be seen in both cool and hot lines
(L1 and L3) follow the polarity neutral line much more closely
than the proxies which appear only in hot lines (L2 and L4). We
suggest that, in L2 and L4, these ﬂux rope proxies detected only
in hot lines may be purely coronal arches at a great height. As
for L1 and L3, the proxies which could be detected in both cool
and hot channels may exist at low heights within ﬁlament chan-
nels. We suggest that, near the polarity neutral line, cool mate-
rials of ﬁlament tend to converge within the ﬂux rope structure.
Meanwhile, interaction of the opposite polarity ﬁelds around the
polarity neutral line may heat up local ﬁlament material. As a re-

sult, ﬂux rope proxies near the polarity neutral line (L1 and L3)
own complicated temperature feature.

Here we notice that ﬂux rope proxies appeared in one loca-
tion for several times. It is possible that 7 ﬂux ropes were de-
tected in 4 diﬀerent locations and repeatedly illuminated for 30
times in total. Since the ﬂux rope proxies in L3 (L4) lasted for
4 days and showed very diﬀerent complexity of geometry when
they reappeared, we suggest that there were 3 (2) ﬂux rope prox-
ies in L3 (L4). In L3, we consider the proxy detected twice on
Nov 16 as the ﬁrst one in this location, the proxy detected for 6
times on Nov 17 and Nov 18 as the second one, and the proxy
detected once on Nov 19 as the third one. Moreover, in L4, the
proxy detected for 7 times on Nov 15 and Nov 16 is identiﬁed as
the ﬁrst one in this location, and the proxy detected twice on Nov
17 and Nov 18 is identiﬁed as the second one. For L1 and L2,
we think that only one ﬂux rope proxy on each of these locations
was detected and repeatedly illuminated. The ﬂux rope proxies
which appeared in one location for several times may also be
described as homologous ﬂux ropes according to the work of Li
& Zhang (2013b). They deﬁned the homologous ﬂux ropes as
follows: (1) originating from the same region within the same
AR; (2) whose endpoints are anchored at the same location; (3)
whose morphologies resemble each other. Synthesizing Table 1
and Fig. 1, we can clearly ﬁnd that ﬂux rope proxies appeared
with remarkable frequency in L2, L3, and L4. During the evo-
lution of this AR’s magnetic ﬁeld (see movie attached to Fig.
1), the positive polarity ﬁeld underlying the L2’s north-western
ends moved north-westward along the neutral line slowly while
the negative ﬁeld underlying south-eastern ends kept generally
still. Thus we consider that frequent appearance of ﬂux rope
proxies in L2 may result from the underlying magnetic ﬁeld’s
lasting shear motion (Amari et al. 1999, 2000). As for L3, Fig-
ure 1(b) shows clearly that it lay above the main polarity neutral
line of NOAA 11897. Considering long-term existence of this
main neutral line, it is explicable that ﬂux rope proxies were ob-
served for 9 times in L3 from November 16 to November 19.
In L4, ﬂux rope proxies were detected for 9 times from Novem-
ber 15 to November 18, which may result from the underlying
strong magnetic ﬁelds. Flux rope proxies in this location con-
nected a pair of strong magnetic ﬁelds, which existed through-
out the entire observation period. Moreover, this pair of strong
magnetic ﬁelds kept canceling with surrounding opposite polar-
ity magnetic ﬁelds and ﬂux cancellation is thought as the pri-
mary formation mechanism of ﬂux ropes (Savcheva et al. 2012a,
b). We follow the evolution of the AR and ﬁnd that three pairs of
magnetic ﬁelds emerged. Flux rope proxies were detected for 27
times in the emerging and stable phase of the magnetic ﬂux. In
the decaying phase, only 10% ﬂux rope proxies (3 times) were
detected, implying an unbalanced distribution of the ﬂux ropes
over the entire AR evolution. Note that none of these ﬂux ropes
has been observed to erupt in the end and all of them just faded
away gradually.

In-depth research on the fan-spine conﬁguration has been
proposed by several authors (Wang & Liu 2012; Sun et al. 2013).
In the work of Sun et al. (2013), ﬂux emergence was believed
to result in a largely closed fan-spine topology. The sequential
brightening of the circular ribbon and the apparent shuﬄing mo-
tion within the hot loop bundle indicated the slipping-type re-
connection (Li & Zhang 2015). Here we report on two exam-
ples which have conspicuous fan-spine conﬁguration, apparent
sequential brightening along the circular ribbon and shuﬄing
motion within the loop bundle in 131 Å passband. And new
ﬂux emergence took place several days prior to the fan-spine
structure’s appearance in both of the two cases. Priest & Dé-

moulin (1995) showed that reconnections may also happen in
quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) where magnetic connectivity is
continuous but with steep gradient. Field lines may continuously
slip within QSLs to exchange their footpoints, which is an ex-
tension of the instantaneous break-and-paste scenario (Aulanier
et al. 2006, 2007). The fan-spine topology (Lau & Finn 1990)
often arises with new ﬂux emergence into a pre-existing ﬁeld.
Part of the new ﬁeld becomes parasitic and surrounded by the
opposite ﬁelds. Then a null point forms in the corona (Török et
al. 2009). Energized particles from reconnection near the null
point ﬂow along the QSLs, brightening their footpoints, which
is the quasi-circler ribbons in our work. For the ﬁrst time, we
detect a secondary fan-spine structure on 2013 November 17. In
the spine, the bidirectional ﬂow was observed, and we suggest
that the ﬂow may be caused by the null-point-type reconnection
as well. Moreover, we notice EUV irradiance delays in lower
temperature channels. The brightening loops connecting quasi-
circle ribbon to remote brightening ribbon were formed in the
fan-spine structure and were heated to over 10 MK (Sun et al.
2013). The delay of the brightening loops’ appearance in cooler
channels, such as 171 Å and 304 Å, suggests a cooling process
(Liu et al. 2013).
