Abstract. We present a combined ﬁt of a simple astrophysical model of UHECR sources
to both the energy spectrum and mass composition data measured by the Pierre Auger
1018 eV, i.e. the region of
Observatory. The ﬁt has been performed for energies above 5
the all-particle spectrum above the so-called “ankle” feature. The astrophysical model we
adopted consists of identical sources uniformly distributed in a comoving volume, where nuclei
are accelerated through a rigidity-dependent mechanism. The ﬁt results suggest sources
characterized by relatively low maximum injection energies, hard spectra and heavy chemical
composition. We also show that uncertainties about physical quantities relevant to UHECR
propagation and shower development have a non-negligible impact on the ﬁt results.

Cosmic rays have been detected up to particle energies around 1020 eV and are the highest
energy particles in the present Universe. In spite of a reasonable number of events already
collected by large experiments around the world, their origin is still largely unknown. It is
widely believed that the particles of energy above a few times 1018 eV (Ultra High Energy
Cosmic Rays, UHECRs) are of extragalactic origin, since galactic magnetic ﬁelds cannot

conﬁne them, and the distribution of their arrival directions appears to be nearly isotropic
[1, 2].
With the aim of investigating the physical properties of UHECR sources, we here use cosmic
ray measurements performed at the Pierre Auger Observatory, whose design, structure and
operation are presented in detail in [3]. The observables we use are the energy spectrum
[4], which is mainly provided by the surface detector (SD), and the shower depth (Xmax)
distribution, provided by the ﬂuorescence detector (FD) [5], which gives information about
the nuclear mass of the cosmic particle hitting the Earth’s atmosphere.
3 [4, 6],
The observed energy spectrum of UHECRs is close to a power law with index γ
1018 eV where the spec-
but there are two important features: the so-called ankle at E
trum becomes ﬂatter (the spectral index decreasing from about 3.3 to 2.6) and a suppression
1019 eV after which the ﬂux sharply decreases. The ankle can be interpreted to
above 4
reﬂect e.g. the transition from a galactic to an extragalactic origin of cosmic rays, or the
e+ e− pair-production dip resulting from cosmic ray proton interactions with the cosmic mi-
crowave background. The decrease at the highest energies, observed at a high degree of
signiﬁcance, can be ascribed to interactions with background radiation [7, 8] and/or to a
maximum energy of cosmic rays at the sources.
Concerning the mass composition, the average Xmax measured at the Pierre Auger Obser-
vatory (as discussed in [5, 9, 10]) indicates that UHECRs become heavier with increasing
1018 eV. Moreover, the measured ﬂuctuations of Xmax indicate a small mass-
energy above 2
dispersion at energies above the ankle. The average Xmax has also been measured by the
Telescope Array collaboration [11]. Within the uncertainties this measurement is consistent
with a variety of primary compositions and it agrees very well with the Auger results [12].
In this paper we investigate the constraining power of the Auger measurements of spectrum
and composition with respect to source properties. Therefore we compare our data with
simulations that are performed starting from rather simple astrophysical scenarios featuring
only a small number of free parameters. We then constrain these astrophysical parameters
taking into account experimental uncertainties on the measurements. To do so, we perform
a detailed analysis of the possible processes that determine the experimental measurements
from the sources to the detector (section 2).
We assume as a working hypothesis that the sources are of extragalactic origin. The sources
inject nuclei, accelerated in electromagnetic processes, and therefore with a rigidity (R =
E/Z) dependent cutoﬀ (section 2.1).
Injected nuclei propagate in extragalactic space and experience interactions with cosmic
photon backgrounds. Their interaction rates depend on the cross sections of various nuclear
processes and on the spectral density of background photons. We use two diﬀerent publicly
available Monte Carlo codes to simulate the UHECR propagation, CRPropa [13–15] and
SimProp [16–18], together with diﬀerent choices of photo-disintegration cross sections and
models for extragalactic radiation (section 2.2).
After propagation, nuclei interact with the atmosphere to produce the observed ﬂux. These
interactions happen at energies larger than those experienced at accelerators, and are mod-
elled by several interaction codes. The interactions in the atmosphere are discussed in section
2.3.
In section 3, we describe the data we use in the ﬁt and the simulations we compare them to,
and in section 4 we describe the ﬁtting procedures we used. The results we obtain (section 5)
are in line with those already presented by several authors [19, 20] and in [21, 22] using a sim-
ilar analysis approach to that of this work. The Auger composition data indicate relatively

– 2 –

narrow Xmax distributions which imply little mixing of elemental ﬂuxes and therefore limited
production of secondaries. This in turn implies low maximum rigidities at the sources, and
hard injection ﬂuxes to reproduce the experimental all-particle spectrum [10].
The novelty of the present paper is that we discuss in detail the eﬀects of theoretical uncer-
tainties on propagation and interactions in the atmosphere of UHECRs and we generally ﬁnd
that they are much larger than the statistical errors on ﬁt parameters (which only depend on
experimental errors). These uncertainties are the feature that limit the ability to constrain
source models, as will be discussed in the conclusions. Moreover, we investigate the depen-
dence of the ﬁt parameters on the experimental systematic uncertainties.
We present some modiﬁcations of the basic astrophysical model, in particular with respect
to the homogeneity of the sources, in section 6.1.
1018 eV. However in section 6.2
In this paper we are mainly interested in the physics above 5
we brieﬂy discuss how our ﬁts can be extended below the ankle, where additional components
(e.g. diﬀerent astrophysical sources) would be required.
In section 7 we present a general discussion of our results and their implications.
Finally appendix A contains some details on the simulations used in this paper and appendix
B on the forward folding procedure used in the ﬁts.

2 UHECRs from their sources to Earth

2.1 Acceleration in astrophysical sources

The hypotheses of the origin of UHECRs can be broadly classiﬁed into two distinct scenarios,
the “bottom-up” scenario and the “top-down” one. The “top-down” source models generally
assume the decay of super-heavy particles; they are disfavoured as the source of the bulk of
UHECRs below 1020 eV by upper limits on photon [23–25] and neutrino [26–29] ﬂuxes that
should be copiously produced at the highest energies, and will not be considered any further
in this work. In the “bottom-up” processes charged particles are accelerated in astrophysical
environments, generally via electromagnetic processes.
The distribution of UHECR sources and the underlying acceleration mechanisms are still
subject of ongoing research. In particular the non-thermal processes relevant for acceleration
to the highest energies constitute an important part of the theory of relativistic plasmas.
Various acceleration mechanisms discussed in the literature include ﬁrst order Fermi shock
acceleration with and without back-reaction of the accelerated particles on the magnetized
plasma [30], plasma wakeﬁeld acceleration [31] and reconnection [32]. Suﬃciently below the
E−γ,

with γ
1.0 for the other cases.
Other processes can even result in ‘inverted’ spectra, with γ < 0 [33–36].
A common representation of the maximal energy of the sources makes use of an exponential
cutoﬀ; yet not all of these scenarios predict power law particle spectra with an exponential
cut-oﬀ [37]. Reconnection, in particular, can give rise to hard spectra up to some charac-
teristic maximal energy. This is also the case if cosmic rays are accelerated in an unipolar
inductor that can arise in the polar caps of rotating magnetized neutron stars [33, 38, 39], or
black holes [40]. If interactions in the magnetospheres can be neglected this also gives rise to
1. Also, second order Fermi acceleration has been proposed to give rise to even harder
γ
spectra [36]. Close to the maximal energy, where interactions can become signiﬁcant, the
species dependent interaction rates can give rise to complex all-particle spectra and individ-
ual spectra whose maximal energies are not simply proportional to the charge Z [34].

On the other hand, individual sources will have diﬀerent characteristics and integrating over
them can result in an eﬀective spectrum that can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from a single source
spectrum. For example, integrating over sources with power law acceleration spectra of dif-
ferent maximal energies or rigidities can result in an eﬀective power law spectrum that is
steeper than that of any of the individual sources [41, 42].
Taking into account all these possibilities would render the ﬁt unmanageable. In this work,
the baseline astrophysical model we use assumes identical extragalactic UHECR sources
uniform in comoving volume and isotropically distributed; source evolution eﬀects are not
considered. We also neglect possible eﬀects of extragalactic magnetic ﬁelds and therefore the
propagation is considered one-dimensional. This model, although widely used, is certainly
over-simpliﬁed. We brieﬂy discuss some possible extensions in section 6.
A description of the spectrum in terms of elementary ﬂuxes injected from astrophysical
sources, all the way from log10(E/eV)
18 up to the highest energies, with a single com-
ponent, is only possible if UHECRs are protons, since protons naturally exhibit the ankle
feature as the electron-positron production dip; however this option is at strong variance
with Auger composition measurements [10, 43] and, to a lesser extent, with the measured
HE neutrino ﬂuxes [44–46]. On the other hand, the ankle can also be interpreted as the tran-
sition between two (or more) diﬀerent populations of sources. In this paper we will assume
this to be the case; for this reason, we will generally present results of ﬁts for energies above
log10(E/eV) = 18.7. An attempt to extend the analysis in the whole energy range is dis-
cussed in section 6.2. Recently there have been attempts [47, 48] to unify the description of
the spectrum down to energies of a fraction of EeV, below which galactic CRs are presumed
to dominate, by considering the eﬀects of the interactions of nuclei with photon ﬁelds in or
surrounding the sources. We do not follow this strategy here, but concentrate only on the
highest energies.
We assume that sources accelerate diﬀerent amounts of nuclei; in principle all nuclei can
be accelerated, however it is reasonable to assume that considering only a representative
subset of injected masses still produces approximately correct results. We therefore assume
that sources inject ﬁve representative stable nuclei: Hydrogen (1H), Helium (4He), Nitrogen
(14N), Silicon (28Si) and Iron (56Fe). Of course particles other than those injected can be
produced by photonuclear interactions during propagation. These nuclei are injected with a
power law of energy (E = ZR) up to some maximum rigidity Rcut, reﬂecting the idea that
acceleration is electromagnetic in origin:

deﬁned, in our procedure, at ﬁxed energy E0 = 1018 eV, below the minimum cutoﬀ energy for
protons. The power law spectrum is modiﬁed by the cutoﬀ function, which describes physical
properties of the sources near the maximum acceleration energy. Here we (arbitrarily) adopt

2.2 The propagation in the Universe

∼

1018 eV and nuclei with E/A . 0.5

At the UHECR energies, accelerated particles travel through the extragalactic environment
and interact with photon backgrounds, changing their energy and, in the case of nuclei, possi-
bly splitting into daughter ones. The inﬂuence of these processes is discussed in detail in [49].
In the energy range we are interested in, the photon energy spectrum includes the cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMB), and the infrared, optical and ultra-violet photons
(hereafter named extragalactic background light, EBL). The CMB has been extremely well
characterized and has been shown to be a very isotropic pure black-body spectrum, at least
to the accuracy relevant for UHECR propagation. The EBL, which comprises the radiation
produced in the Universe since the formation of the ﬁrst stars, is relatively less known: sev-
eral models of EBL have been proposed [50–56], among which there are sizeable diﬀerences,
especially in the far infrared and at high redshifts.
Concerning the interactions of protons and nuclei in the extragalactic environment, the loss
mechanisms and their relevance for the propagation were predicted by Greisen [7] and in-
dependently by Zatsepin and Kuzmin [8] soon after the discovery of the CMB. First, all
particles produced at cosmological distances lose energy adiabatically by the expansion of
the Universe, with an energy loss length c/H0
4 Gpc. This is the dominant energy loss
1018 eV. At higher
mechanism for protons with E . 2
energies, the main energy loss mechanisms are electron-positron pair production mainly due
to CMB photons and, in the case of nuclei, photo-disintegration in which a nucleus is stripped
by one or more nucleons or (more rarely) α particles, for which interactions both on the EBL
1019 eV), the
and the CMB have a sizeable impact. At even higher energies (E/A & 6
dominant process is the photo-meson production on CMB photons.
The cross sections for pair production can be analytically computed via the Bethe-Heitler
formula, and those for photo-meson production have been precisely measured in accelerator-
based experiments and have been accurately modelled by codes such as SOPHIA [57]. On
the other hand, the cross sections for photo-disintegration of nuclei, especially for exclusive
channels in which charged fragments are ejected, have only been measured in a few cases;
there are several phenomenological models that can be used to estimate them, but they are
not always in agreement with the few experimental data available or with each other [49].
In order to interpret UHECR data within astrophysical scenarios some modelling of the extra-
galactic propagation is needed. Several approaches have been used to follow the interactions
in the extragalactic environment, both analytically and using Monte Carlo codes. In this
paper simulations based on CRPropa [13–15] and SimProp [16–18] will be used, along with
the Gilmore [53] and Dom´ınguez (ﬁducial) [54] models of EBL and the Puget, Stecker and
Bredekamp (PSB) [58, 59], TALYS [49, 60–62] and Geant4 [63] models of photo-disintegration
in various combinations.
A comparison between the Monte Carlo codes used here is beyond the scope of this paper,
and has been discussed in [49].

2.3 Extensive air showers and their detection

Once a nucleus reaches the Earth it produces an extensive air shower by interacting with
the atmosphere. Such a shower can be detected by surface detectors (SD) and, during dark

– 5 –

moonless nights, by ﬂuorescence detectors (FD) [3]. The FD measures the shower proﬁle,
i.e. the energy deposited by the shower per unit atmospheric depth. The integral of the
proﬁle gives a measurement of the calorimetric energy of the shower, while the position of the
maximum Xmax provides information about the primary nucleus which initiated the cascade.
The SD measures the density of shower particles at ground level, which can be used to
estimate the shower energy, using the events simultaneously detected by both the SD and the
FD for calibration. There are several models available to simulate the hadronic interactions
involved in the shower development. They can be used to estimate the distribution of Xmax
for showers with a given primary mass number A and total energy E. In this work, we use the
Auger SD data for the energy spectrum and the Auger FD data for the Xmax distributions.
The simulated mass compositions from the propagation simulations are converted to Xmax
distributions assuming EPOS-LHC [64], QGSJetII-04 [65] and Sibyll 2.1 [66] as the hadronic
interaction models.

in the same bins of energy up to log10(E/eV) = 19.5 and a ﬁnal bin from 19.5 to 20.0, for a
total of 110 non zero data points. In total, we have 47767 events in the part of the spectrum
we use in the ﬁt and 1446 in the Xmax distributions.
In the Auger data the energy spectrum and the Xmax distributions are independent measure-
ments and the model likelihood is therefore given by L = LJ ·
LXmax. The goodness-of-ﬁt is
assessed with a generalized χ2, (the deviance, D), deﬁned as the negative log-likelihood ratio
of a given model and the saturated model that perfectly describes the data:

3.1 Spectrum

Measurements of UHECR energies are aﬀected by uncertainties of the order of 10%, due to
both shower-to-shower ﬂuctuations and detector eﬀects. These can cause detected events to
be reconstructed in the wrong energy bin. As a consequence of the true spectrum being a
decreasing function of energy, more of the events with a given reconstructed energy Erec have
a true energy Etrue < Erec than Etrue > Erec. The net eﬀect of this is that the reconstructed
spectrum is shifted to higher energies and smoothed compared to the true spectrum.
In ref. [4], we adopted an unfolding procedure to correct the measured spectrum for these
eﬀects, consisting in assuming a phenomenological “true” spectrum J mod
unf , convolving it by the
detector response function to obtain a folded spectrum J mod
fold , computing the correction factors
c(E) = J mod
unf (E) =
c(E)J obs
fold(E) is the raw event count in a reconstructed energy bin divided by
the bin width and the detector exposure. This procedure is an approximation which does not
take into account the dependence of the correction factors on the assumed shape of J mod
unf ,
thereby potentially underestimating the total uncertainties on J obs
unf .
To avoid this problem, in this work we apply a forward-folding procedure to the simulated
true spectrum J(E) obtained from each source model (spectral index, maximum rigidity and

fold (E), and obtaining a corrected measured spectrum as J obs

being the shower zenith angle [68]. For the present analysis, the vertical and inclined SD
spectra are combined (i.e. µm = µvert

3.2 Composition

The Xmax distribution at a given energy can be obtained using standard shower propagation
codes. The distributions depend on the mass of the nucleus entering the atmosphere and the

distribution, which takes the form of a generalized Gumbel distribution g(Xmax
|
The Gumbel parameters have been determined with CONEX [70] shower simulations using
diﬀerent hadronic interaction models: we use here the parameterizations for EPOS-LHC [64],
QGSJetII-04 [65] and Sibyll 2.1 [66]. The Gumbel parameterization provides a reasonable
description of the Xmax distribution in a wide energy range with the resulting
and
σ(Xmax) diﬀering by less than a few g cm−2 from the CONEX simulated value [69]. The
advantage of using this parametric function is that it allows us to evaluate the model Xmax
distribution for any mixture of nuclei without the need to simulate showers for each primary.
In this analysis the distributions of mass numbers A = 1
To compare with the measured Xmax distributions, the Gumbel distributions are corrected for
detection eﬀects to give the expected model probability (Gmodel
), evaluated at the logarithmic
average of the energies of the observed events in the bin m, for a given mass distribution at
detection (see appendix B). The last energy bin of the measured Xmax distribution combines
the energies log10(E/eV)
= 19.62. We, therefore, combine
the same bins in the simulated X rec
max distribution (B.10). In the Xmax measurement [5] the
total number of events nm per energy bin m is ﬁxed, as the information about the spectral
ﬂux is already captured by the spectrum likelihood. The probability of observing a Xmax
distribution ~km = (km1, km2...) then follows a multinomial distribution.

4 Fitting procedures

In order to derive the value of ﬁtted parameters (and the associated errors) and cross-check
the results, we follow two independent ﬁtting procedures that are described below.
We use four parameters for the mass composition at injection, assuming that the sources
inject only Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen, Silicon and Iron. We do this because not including
Silicon among the possible injected elements would result in a much worse ﬁt to the measured
spectrum (D(J) = 41.7 instead of 13.3 in the reference scenario), due to a gap in the simulated
spectrum between the disintegration cutoﬀs of Nitrogen and Iron not present in the data,
whereas including more elements would only marginally improve the goodness of ﬁt. In either
case, there are no sizeable changes in the best-ﬁt values of γ, Rcut, or D(Xmax). In all the
cases considered below, the best ﬁt Iron fraction is zero.1

4.1 Likelihood scanning

P

1.5

2.5, log10(Rcut/V) = 17.5

In this approach a uniform scan over (γ, log10(Rcut)) binned pairs is performed and for each
pair the deviance is minimized as a function of the fractions (fA) of masses ejected at the
source. The Minuit [71] package is used; since
fA = 1, the number of parameters n in the
minimization is equal to the number of masses at source minus one. The elemental fractions
are taken as the (squared) direction cosines in n dimensions. The scan is performed in the
20.5 intervals, on a grid with 0.01 spacing in γ and
γ =
log10(Rcut). This range contains the predictions for Fermi acceleration (γ
2.2), as well
as possible alternative source models (see section 2.1).
The best ﬁt solution found after the scan procedure is used for evaluating errors on ﬁt
parameters. In order to do so nmock simulated data sets are generated from the best solution
found in the ﬁt, with statistics equal to the real data set. With nmock = 104 we found
stability in the outcomes. The procedure is similar to the one described in [9]. The quality
of the ﬁt, “p-value”, is calculated as the fraction of mock datasets with Dmin worse than
that obtained from the real data. The best ﬁt solution corresponding to each mock data
set is found and the mean value of the distribution of each ﬁt parameter is evaluated. One
standard deviation statistical uncertainties are calculated within the limits containing 68% of
the area of the corresponding distribution of (γ, Rcut, fA). Concerning γ and Rcut we found
that the errors so obtained are well approximated by those evaluated considering the intervals

In the second approach we apply a ﬁt constraining all the parameters, (γ, Rcut and the four
mass fractions) simultaneously, taking into account the statistical and correlated systematic
uncertainties of the measured data. For this we use the Bayesian formalism where the

a few other cases, we only used Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen and Silicon (three parameters) in the remaining
ﬁts, in order to have a faster, more reliable minimization.

use Gaussian priors with mean 0 and standard deviation corresponding to the systematic
uncertainty of the measurements.
The posterior probability is sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
[74]. For each ﬁt, we run the MCMC algorithm from multiple random starting positions in
the parameter space, and require that the Gelman-Rubin statistic ˆR [75] be less than 1.04
for all parameters in order to assess the convergence of the ﬁt.
To include the experimental systematic uncertainties the ﬁt performs continuous shifts of the
energy scale and shower maximum with a technique called template morphing [76]. This is
done by interpolating between template distributions corresponding to discrete systematic
shifts. The nuisance parameters representing these shifts are ﬁtted simultaneously with the
parameters of the astrophysical model. For each parameter we report the posterior mean
and the shortest interval containing 68% of the posterior probability, as well as the best ﬁt
solution.

P

4.3 Systematic uncertainties

The most important sources of experimental systematic uncertainties in the present analysis
are on the energy scale and on Xmax . The systematic uncertainties can be treated as nuisance
parameters to be determined simultaneously in the ﬁtting procedure, starting from Gaussian
prior distributions. We use this approach when performing the posterior sampling method
of section 4.2. Alternatively, all measured energy and/or Xmax values can be shifted by a
ﬁxed amount corresponding to one systematic standard deviation in each direction; this is
the approach used when performing the likelihood scanning method of section 4.1.

5 The ﬁt results

In this section, we ﬁrst present the ﬁt results in a “reference” scenario; then we study the
eﬀect on the ﬁt results of variations of this scenario, using diﬀerent propagation simulations,
air interaction models, shapes of the injection cutoﬀ functions, or shifting all the measured
energy or Xmax data within their systematic uncertainty.

5.1 The reference ﬁt

We describe now the results of the ﬁt, taking as reference SimProp propagation with PSB
cross sections, and using the Gilmore EBL model (SPG). The hadronic interaction model
used to describe UHECR-air interactions for this ﬁt is EPOS-LHC [64]. The choice of this
particular set of models will be discussed in section 5.3.3. The best ﬁt parameters for this
model are reported in table 1; errors are calculated as described in section 4.1.

ﬁt of the other parameters (J0 and fA).
From the ﬁgure we see that there is a very deﬁnite correlation between γ and Rcut: this cor-
relation is a quite general feature of the combined ﬁt, appearing in all the diﬀerent variations
of the reference ﬁt discussed below. Considering the deviance distribution it is immediate
to note that there are two regions of local minima: one, which contains the best minimum,
corresponds to a low value of Rcut and a spectral index γ
1; this minimum region is quite
extended towards smaller values of γ at a slowly decreasing Rcut. In ﬁgure 2 we present the
spectrum data we actually ﬁt and the Xmax distributions together with the ﬁtted functions,
while in ﬁgure 3 the ﬁt results are compared for reference to the all-particle spectrum and
Xmax momenta. The essential features of such a model have been discussed elsewhere [19, 20]
and, using a similar approach to that of this work, in [21], the general features being a low
maximum rigidity around log10(Rcut/V) = 18.5, a hard spectrum and a composition domi-
nated by Helium and heavier elements.
There is also a second relative minimum, which appears less extended, around the pair
γ = 2.04 and log10(Rcut/V) = 19.88. For nuclei injected with these parameters the eﬀects of
interactions during propagation are dominant, as it is demonstrated by copious production
of high energy secondaries (in particular Hydrogen). This is the reason why in this region
the ﬁt to composition is quite bad, as reported in table 1 and in ﬁgure 4, with Xmax simu-
lated distributions almost always larger than experimentally observed; this solution, in the
reference model, can be excluded at the 7.5σ level.

Because of the low value of Rcut, the observed spectra are strongly sensitive to the behaviour
of accelerators near the maximum energy and therefore even large diﬀerences of injection
spectral indices have little eﬀect on the observable quantities. This is the reason of the large
extent of the best minima region, and will be discussed below.
Given the deviance reported in table 1, the probability of getting a worse ﬁt if the model is
correct (p-value) is p = 2.6%. Notice however that the eﬀect of experimental systematics is
not taken into account here. A discussion of systematics is presented in section 5.2.
The errors on the parameters are computed as explained in 4.1. Those on the elemen-
tal fractions are generally large, indicating that diﬀerent combinations of elemental spectra
can give rise to similar observed spectra. This fact is reﬂected by the presence of large
(anti)correlations among the injected nuclear spectra, as shown in table 2.

Figure 3. Top: simulated energy spectrum of UHECRs (multiplied by E3) at the top of the Earth’s
atmosphere, obtained with the best-ﬁt parameters for the reference model using the procedure de-
scribed in section 3. Partial spectra are grouped as in ﬁgure 2. For comparison the ﬁtted spectrum
is reported together with the spectrum in [4] (ﬁlled circles). Bottom: average and standard deviation
of the Xmax distribution as predicted (assuming EPOS-LHC UHECR-air interactions) for the model
(brown) versus pure 1H (red), 4He (grey), 14N (green) and 56Fe (blue), dashed lines. Only the energy
range where the brown lines are solid is included in the ﬁt.

The main systematic eﬀects derive from the energy scale in the spectrum [4], and the Xmax
scale [5]. The uncertainty on the former is assumed constant ∆E/E = 14% in the whole
energy range considered, while that on composition ∆Xmax is asymmetric and slightly energy
dependent, ranging from about 6 to 9 g/cm2. As described in section 3 two approaches are
used to take into account the experimental systematics in the ﬁt.
Including the systematics as nuisance parameters in the ﬁt, we obtain the results in table
3. Here the average value and uncertainty interval of the model parameters include both
statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measurement. Also shown are shifts in the
energy scale and Xmax scale of the experiment as preferred by the ﬁt. Both remain within
one standard deviation of the given uncertainties. The eﬀect of ﬁxed shifts within the exper-
imental systematics are reported in table 4.
From the results one can infer that the total deviance of the ﬁt is not strongly sensitive to
shifts in the energy scale, though the injection mass fractions are. This is because an increase

(or decrease) in the observed position of the energy cutoﬀ can be reproduced by assuming a
heavier (lighter) mass composition, as the photo-disintegration threshold energy is roughly
proportional to the mass number of the nuclei.
On the other hand, a negative 1 σ change on the Xmax scale does not change D(J) and
slightly improves D(Xmax) and moves γ towards somewhat larger values. A positive change
dramatically drives γ towards negative values outside the ﬁtted interval and moves Rcut
towards lower values, since it implies a lighter composition at all energies, in strong disagree-
ment with the width of the Xmax distributions. Taking into account systematics as in tables

Figure 7. The eﬀect of diﬀerent hadronic interaction models, using propagation model SPG and
various UHECR-air interaction models

consider the inﬂuence of this choice on the results. For this reason, we have repeated the ﬁt
of the SPG model using Sibyll 2.1 [66] and QGSJet II-04 [65]. The results are presented in
table 5 and in ﬁgure 7. The use of these interaction models signiﬁcantly worsens the goodness
of the ﬁt in the chosen range of ﬁtted parameters, as shown in ﬁgure 8 and quantiﬁed by
the D(Xmax) values in table 5, pushing towards very low values of Rcut and consequently
extreme negative values of γ.

5.3.2 Shape of the injection cut-oﬀ

We discuss here the eﬀect of the shape of the cut-oﬀ function we have chosen for the reference
ﬁt. This choice has been purely instrumental and is not physically motivated. More physical
possibilities can be considered, starting from a simple exponential multiplying the power-law
ﬂux at all energies, to more complex possibilities (see section 2.1). In table 6 we present the
eﬀect on the ﬁt parameters of the choice of an exponential cut-oﬀ function.
It has to be noted that the two injection models are not as diﬀerent as directly comparing
the numerical values of the parameters suggests, because the simple exponential cutoﬀ takes
over sooner than a broken exponential one with the same nominal cutoﬀ rigidity and makes
d ln J/d ln E = γ + E/(ZRcut) > γ, see ﬁgure 9). In any event,
the spectrum softer (γeﬀ =
the goodness of ﬁt is almost identical in the two cases, so our data are not sensitive to their
diﬀerence.

5.3.3 Propagation models

As a consequence of the low maximum rigidity in the best ﬁt, interactions on the CMB are
subdominant with respect to those on the EBL, particularly for medium atomic number nu-
clei (see for instance [49]). Therefore, poorly known processes such as photo-disintegration
of medium nuclei (e.g. CNO) on EBL can strongly aﬀect extragalactic propagation. In [49]
a detailed discussion of several such eﬀects can be found, as well as a comparison of the two
propagation codes used. Particular importance have, for instance, the radiation intensity
peak in the far infrared region, and the partial cross sections of photo-disintegration chan-
nels in which α particles are ejected.
To study the eﬀects of uncertainties in the simulations of UHECR propagation, we repeated
the ﬁt using the combinations of Monte Carlo propagation code, photo-disintegration cross
sections and EBL spectrum listed in table 7.
In the present analysis EBL spectra and
evolution are taken from [53] (Gilmore 2012) and [54] (Dom´ınguez 2011). As for photo-
disintegration, here we use the cross sections from [50, 51] (PSB), [61] (TALYS, as described
in [49]), and Geant4 [63] total cross sections with TALYS branching ratios ([49]).
In table 8 we present the spectrum parameters of the best ﬁt at the principal minimum, while
table 9 contains the elemental fractions. We have veriﬁed that the diﬀerent ﬁtting procedures
outlined in section 4.1, 4.2 have no inﬂuence on the ﬁt results.
The diﬀerence among models with diﬀerent physical assumptions are generally much larger
than the statistical errors on the parameters, implying that they really correspond to diﬀer-
ent physical cases, at least in the best minimum region.
In ﬁgure 10 we show the dependence of the deviance D on γ and Rcut (with all the other pa-
rameters ﬁxed at their best ﬁt values) for the models we used in the ﬁt. From the parameters
in tables 8, 9 and the behaviours in ﬁgure 10 some considerations can be drawn. Concerning

EBL models it is clear that the Dom´ınguez model of EBL, having a stronger peak in the far
infrared aﬀects more the propagation and would result in too many low-energy secondary
protons unless the cutoﬀ rigidity is lowered, with a resulting negative spectral index and
lighter composition.
The strength of interactions has a similar eﬀect: PSB [58, 59] cross sections (which altogether
neglect α production) imply generally larger maximum rigidity than TALYS [61] cross sec-
tions (which largely overestimate α production), with a similar eﬀect on spectral index and
elemental fractions at injection.
As a consequence, the reference model exhibits the lowest deviance D as a function of γ,
while the models using Dom´ınguez EBL have a much less deﬁned minimum in the region

In the local minimum at γ
2 the diﬀerence among models is greatly reduced; this reﬂects
the fact that here interactions happen dominantly on CMB, which is known to much higher
precision than EBL and interaction lengths are so short that almost all nuclei fully photo-
disintegrate regardless of the choice of cross sections. The larger D however in all cases
disfavours this minimum with respect to the best one.

5.3.4 Sensitivity of the ﬁt to the source parameters

The ﬁtting procedure has diﬀerent sensitivity on the parameters that all together character-
ize the sources. The spectral index γ and the rigidity cutoﬀ log10(Rcut/V) are well ﬁtted in
a wide region of astrophysical interest, whereas the fractions of injected nuclei are always
poorly determined, mainly because of the sizable correlations among them, as shown in table
2 for the SPG model.2 Moreover, the detected observables, the all-particle spectrum and the
longitudinal shower proﬁles, are either weakly dependent on the nuclei that reach the Earth
or, as for the Xmax distributions, depend logarithmically on their mass number. For this
reason, diﬀerent combinations of injected nuclear species can produce similar observables. In
ﬁgure 11 we show the (γ,
log10(Rcut/V)) region considered in our ﬁts (tables 7, 8, 9). The
valley lines of the ﬁt, corresponding to the values of Rcut, fA and spectrum normalization
that minimize D for each value of γ, show a slightly increasing region of low spectral indexes
below γ
0.5, with a logarithmic rigidity cut between 18 and 18.5, and one with a steeply
increasing spectral index region between 2 and 2.5, and corresponding large rigidity; these
lines are a common feature of the models with small diﬀerences among them.
A noticeable fact is the variation of mean mass at injection along the valley lines. The arrows
at the bottom of ﬁgure 11 show for each propagation model the γ region where the injection
is dominated by light elements (fH + fHe > 90%). This happens when the spectral index
is below some value ranging from about
0.5 to +0.5 depending on the propagation model
used (tables 8, 9).
In ﬁgure 12 we show the injected spectra (top) as a function of the spectral index along
the valley line and the corresponding ﬂuxes at detection (bottom) for the SPG propagation
It is clear that for values of the spectral index suﬃciently small the form of the

gle elements; it is rather the tuning of elemental fractions that determines the ﬁnal overall
injection spectrum. In the negative γ region fractions eﬀectively substitute the spectral pa-
rameters to shape the overall ﬂux: this is the reason why here the sensitivity to the spectral
index becomes poor.
The values of Rcut along the valley line for γ
+0.5 correspond to a propagation regime
dominated by EBL photons, with energy loss lengths from hundreds of Mpc to Gpc (at
the cutoﬀ energy). The propagation with (γ, Rcut) in this region depends strongly on the
photo-disintegration cross sections and EBL parameterization, and, in negative-γ region, the
sensitivity to the propagation details becomes so extreme to make sub-dominant channels to
play a major role [49]. This fact can explain the change of regime along the valley lines.

6.1 Homogeneity of source distribution and evolution

As indicated in section 2.1 we have assumed homogeneity (and isotropy) in the distribution
of the sources. It is clear that nearby sources are not distributed homogeneously (nor isotrop-
ically). In [77] the eﬀect of nearby sources on the description of the data has been discussed,
and, more recently [78], the eﬀect of the evolution of the sources (with redshift).
Only particles originating from z . 0.5 are able to reach the Earth with E > 1018.7 eV,
so only the source evolution at small redshifts is relevant. At such small redshifts, most
proposed parameterizations of the evolution of the emissivity (luminosity times density) of
sources with redshift are of the form (1 + z)m [79], although more detailed dependences are
possible in selected cases.

Figure 13. Simulated energy spectrum of UHECRs (multiplied by E3) at the top of the Earth’s
atmosphere, best-ﬁt parameters for model SPG, along with Auger data points. The dashed (yel-
lowish) line shows the sub-ankle component obtained by subtracting from the experimental data the
continuation of the all-particle spectrum (ﬁgure 3) below the ﬁtted energy region. The composition
below the ankle is derived from the mass fractions obtained in [9] averaged in the same energy range
(see text).

In the simple case above, positive m implies more luminous and/or dense far sources, with
increased importance of interactions on the photon backgrounds, and the contrary for neg-
ative evolution. To evaluate the possible eﬀect on the ﬁtted parameters, we have repeated
the ﬁt, using the reference SPG model, for several values of m, and (for m = 0) assuming
a maximal source redshift at zmax = 0.02, corresponding to a distance of
80 Mpc. The
results of the ﬁt are summarized in table 10.
The changing of the evolution has a strong eﬀect on the spectral index: negative m allow
values of γ nearer to the expected for the standard Fermi mechanism, and a corresponding
slight increase of Rcut. Limiting the distances has a similar eﬀect.3 On the other hand, in
the cases considered in the table, the deviance of the best solution does not change much, so
we cannot conclude that these scenarios are required by the data.

≈

6.2 The ankle and the need for an additional component

In section 5 we have shown the results of the combined ﬁt of spectrum and composition data
in the energy region above the ankle. This choice was motivated by the mixed nature of
the measured composition and the impossibility to generate the ankle feature with the basic
scenario outlined in section 2.1. As a consequence, we have implicitly assumed that the ﬂux
below the ankle has to be explained as due to the superposition of additional component(s).
This component can be originated by diﬀerent sources and mechanisms. An exclusive galac-
tic origin is diﬃcult to accomodate, up to the ankle energy, in the standard paradigm of
acceleration in SNRs. Therefore extragalactic CR sources are expected to contribute to the

3Also propagation in extragalactic magnetic ﬁelds may induce similar changes [80] since in presence of a

turbulent magnetic ﬁeld the distance from which UHECRs reach detection is eﬀectively limited.

low energy component that generate the ankle feature. These sources should reasonably be-
long to a diﬀerent class with respect to the one used in our ﬁt above the ankle. The study
of the ﬂux and composition below the ankle is beyond the scope of this paper and shall be
more eﬀectively addressed using in the combined ﬁt the data from the Auger detectors spe-
cially dedicated to low energy showers [3]: the Inﬁll 750 m-spacing array and HEAT (High
Elevation Auger Telescopes) [4, 81]. Here we limit the discussion on the possible eﬀects of a
sub-ankle component on the solutions found in the section 5, taking as a reference the best
ﬁt solution for the reference propagation model.
For this purpose, we ﬁrst obtain the ﬂux for log10(E/eV) < 18.7 by subtracting from the ex-
perimental data the lower energy continuation of the all-particle ﬂux ﬁtted above this value.
We assume below the ankle the elemental fractions in [9] where they are obtained from the
same Xmax distributions used in this work, independently in each energy bin; to reduce ﬂuc-
tuations from bin to bin we use their averages for log10(E/eV)
18.6 (for EPOS-LHC, 59%
H, 5.6% He, 32% N and 3.8% Fe). The resultant ﬂuxes are presented in ﬁgure 13. This ap-

≤

– 24 –

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proach by construction gives a description of the spectrum and composition at lower energy
fully consistent with the data, but cannot give any indication on the nature of the sources.
In order to obtain more information, we then ﬁt the sub-ankle ﬂux obtained as described
above, assuming UHECRs in this energy range are injected by a class of sources similar to
those described in section 2.1 (although with diﬀerent physical parameters). To account for
the possible presence of a sub-dominant component of the galactic ﬂux, we assume an iron
ﬂux modeled as the one obtained by the KASCADE-Grande (KG) collaboration assuming
EPOS as hadronic interaction model [82].4 Under this assumption we ﬁnd that a reasonable
description of the sub-ankle component is obtained for a spectral index γ = 3.6, a rigidity
cutoﬀ log10(Rcut/V) = 18.4 and a mix of about 56% H, 35% N and 9% Si.
The two components are summed each multiplied by adjustable weight factors to account for
the superposition eﬀects, and the spectrum errors below the ankle are increased adding in
quadrature a 3% oﬀset to account for possible related uncertainties. The limited interaction
between the two components is reﬂected by the values, close to 1, of the two weight factors,
1.01 (0.97) for the sub-ankle (super-ankle) component.
The result of this procedure is shown in ﬁgure 14. The sub-ankle spectrum and composition
merge with the ﬁtted spectrum giving rise to a comprehensive description in the whole energy
range. It has to be stressed that this does not come out from an overall minimization of a
two-component source model and therefore it simply shows that there are possible sub-ankle
components consistent with our ﬁtted spectrum and composition.
The result of this procedure gives a similar description to that discussed above (ﬁgure 13);
moreover, the sub-ankle component used here is mixed as well as the one describing the
super-ankle region, containing elements heavier than protons, as consequence of the Xmax
behaviour below the ankle, where the mean value is close to the one generated by pure He,
but the dispersion close to that of H. This is the main reason of the excess of simulated ﬂux
in the ankle region, since the presence of nuclei heavier than protons does not allow us to
reproduce a steep ﬂux like the one obtained by subtraction. Although the procedure used
does not allow us to draw ﬁrm conclusions, it appears diﬃcult that a population of sources
with a rigidity dependent cutoﬀ can reproduce a sharp ankle as in the Auger data.
As already stated the approach followed here is partial and cannot provide a full description
of the data from the lowest energies; however it suggests that a description of the sub-ankle
data does not necessarily spoil the main features of the ﬁt as discussed in section 5.

7 Discussion

We have presented in this paper a ﬁt of the experimental measurements (spectrum and mass
composition) performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory at UHECRs energies above the
ankle, assuming an extragalactic origin. Although the best ﬁt obtained depends to consid-
erable extent on the models used for propagation in the extragalactic space and interactions
in the atmosphere, we have found some general features characterizing the parameters of the
astrophysical model chosen (γ, Rcut, the elemental fractions fA and total emissivity
Referring to ﬁgures 3 and 11, it is evident that the best ﬁt solutions present a marked
correlation between γ and log10(Rcut/V), and two local minima regions:

For large values of the maximum energy at the source, ZRcut, the observed drop of the
spectrum is a consequence of interactions during propagation in the background radiation.
However, the copious secondary production implies a very mixed composition at odds with
observations. In this region interactions occur predominantly on the CMB, and almost all
nuclei fully photo-disintegrate into nucleons, which explains the little dependence on details
of propagation.
Decreasing Rcut, the propagated ﬂuxes start to show the eﬀect of the cutoﬀ at the sources
with the consequence that the maximum energy of secondary protons is pushed to low values,
which in turn produces a less mixed composition in better agreement with data. In this re-
gion the observed spectrum starts to be reproduced by the envelope of hard elemental ﬂuxes
(γ
1), cut by a decrease that is caused by both the source cutoﬀ (for the secondary nu-
cleons) and the photo-disintegration (for the surviving primary medium and heavy nuclei).
This is the region of parameters in which the best ﬁt of the reference case resides. Since
the cutoﬀ rigidity corresponds to an energy per nucleon way below the threshold for pion
production on the CMB, the resulting ﬂux of cosmogenic neutrinos at EeV energies is neg-
ligible. Also, particles with magnetic rigidity E/Z . 5 EV can be deﬂected by intergalactic
and galactic magnetic ﬁelds by several tens of degrees5 even when originating from relatively
nearby sources [88], making it very hard to infer source positions.
At even lower values of Rcut interactions on EBL begin to dominate, and are in any case
relatively weak. Primary Hydrogen and Helium become then dominant in order to reproduce
composition data, and the observed spectra are the product of ﬁne tuning of the elemental
ﬂuxes at injection.
This interplay between astrophysical source properties and eﬀects of propagation then ex-
plains the general trend observed in section 5: copious interactions, both depending on the
choice of background and of cross sections require a small Rcut and possibly negative γ in a
very ﬂat minima region. This partly explains why the position of the best ﬁt for low γ is so
strongly model-dependent and why the models with lower best-ﬁt values of γ tend to have
larger uncertainty intervals on it (see ﬁgure 12).
The use of the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1 or QGSJet II-04 in place of EPOS-LHC
worsens the ﬁt, pushing the best ﬁt to the lowest considered values of spectral index and
requiring lighter mass compositions. This is because the widths of measured Xmax distribu-
tions, which depend both on shower-to-shower ﬂuctuations and the amount of superposition
of diﬀerent masses, are relatively narrow. Sibyll 2.1 and QGSJet II-04 predict very broad

5Indeed, the conclusion that the highest-energy CRs include many light and medium-mass nuclei but few
protons was independently reached by other authors [83–87] from the observation of a few excesses in the
◦
angular distribution of UHECR arrival directions in regions of ∼ 20
radius and the lack of excesses on
smaller scales.

Xmax distributions which are hard to reconcile with Auger data even assuming a pure mass
composition. Therefore it is not surprising that in this situation the ﬁt seeks to keep the
propagated energy spectra for individual mass groups as separated as possible, corresponding
to negative γ, and even then cannot reasonably reproduce Auger data.
The ﬁt results are also somewhat dependent on the Auger energy and Xmax scales, on which
there are sizeable systematic uncertainties. The eﬀect of shifting the energy scale is com-
pensated by a change of composition at the sources, with very small eﬀects in the other
parameters or the overall goodness of ﬁt. On the other hand, shifting the Xmax distributions
downwards by their systematic uncertainty requires a somewhat higher spectral index and
heavier composition and improves the ﬁt; shifting them upwards requires a much lower spec-
tral index and lighter composition and worsens the ﬁt.
Some departures from the simple astrophysical model used are considered in section 6.1,
where we discuss the eﬀect of modiﬁcations of the hypothesis of constant emissivity of the
(1 + z)m with m > 0 would make
sources. We ﬁnd that an evolution of source emissivity
the ﬁt worse due to the increased level of interactions that produce abundant secondary
protons, whereas with m < 0 the goodness of ﬁt is not aﬀected much and a higher injection
spectral index is required. Limiting the source distance has a similar eﬀect.
It has been
noted that diﬀusion in extragalactic magnetic ﬁelds [80] may eﬀectively limit the distance
from which particles reach detection, and produce softer injection spectra: to better evaluate
the importance of this mechanism, three-dimensional propagation simulations are needed.
Finally, in section 6.2 we have discussed how the results obtained ﬁtting spectrum and com-
position above the ankle can be aﬀected by the sub-ankle ﬂux. An additional component of
extragalactic nuclei, mostly H and N, with a generation spectrum much steeper than the one
obtained by the ﬁt above the ankle can be introduced to provide a reasonable description of
the data in the whole energy range. The new component appears not to interfere much with
the general picture discussed above. However it appears diﬃcult to reproduce a sharp ankle
as in the Auger data once a rigidity cutoﬀ is assumed for the sub-ankle component. One
possible way out is to assume from the beginning a model generating the ankle feature as a
consequence of interactions in the source photon environment, such as for example [47, 48]
and compare with experimental data: we did not follow this strategy in this paper.

8 Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that, within given hypotheses on propagation and interaction at
Earth, Auger data can bind the physical parameters of the sources in the simple astrophysi-
cal model considered. However several diﬀerent hypotheses (i.e. atmospheric interaction and
EBL models, choices of photo-disintegration cross sections) can be made with resulting source
parameters well outside the statistical uncertainties of the ﬁt. Better models of UHECR-air
hadronic interactions, EBL spectrum and evolution, or photo-disintegration cross sections
and branching ratios would help reduce these uncertainties.
The results obtained show some sensitivity to experimental systematics, in particular to that
on Xmax. About that, the new operation of Auger (AugerPrime) [89] will produce more com-
position sensitive observables, in particular connected to muons in showers, in an extended
energy range, including the highest energies, and with reduced systematics. Also the planned
extended FD operation will increase the statistics of shower development measurements at
the highest energies.

In order to compute the simulated spectrum that the measured data points are compared to,
we use either SimProp [16–18] or CRPropa [13–15] simulations. Both SimProp and CRPropa
runs simulate events with a uniform distribution of log10(Einj/eV), but the injection points
are uniform in zinj in SimProp and in tinj in CRPropa. A uniform distribution of sources
per unit comoving volume corresponds to a uniform distribution of injection times for the
events arriving at Earth (if counting as one event the arrival of all the particles originat-
ing from the same primary), so in the case of SimProp each event is weighed by a factor

that these numbers of events result in squared statistical uncertainties on the simulations less
than 10% of those on the Auger data in each of the energy bin of the ﬁt. We then bin all the
particles arriving at Earth in bins of both log10(Einj/eV) and log10(EEarth/eV) of width 0.01,
obtaining a four-dimensional matrix giving the average number of nuclei arriving at Earth
with a given mass number AEarth in a given EEarth bin for each primary injected with a given
mass number Ainj in a given Einj bin. This matrix can be multiplied by a vector representing
the injection spectrum to obtain a vector representing the true spectrum at Earth, or also
by an analogous matrix representing the detector properties (see appendix B) to obtain the
folded spectrum at Earth, which when multiplied by the detector exposure and integrated
over the energy bins results in the expected number of events µm which enters the deviance
function.

B Treatment of detector eﬀects

The astrophysical models, combined with propagation in extragalactic photon backgrounds,
predict elemental ﬂuxes at the top of the atmosphere. The signal generated on the detectors,
after interactions in the atmosphere, is then reconstructed in terms of physical observables
and, to do so, experimental uncertainty and biases have to be taken into account. For each
generated true ﬂux J(Etrue) (which depends on source parameters) we have a corresponding
reconstructed (folded) ﬂux

It is worthwhile noting that the model ﬁt gives a ﬂux that is lower than the observed ﬂux
below the energy threshold of the ﬁt. As a consequence, the migration of events from low
energies into the ﬁtting range is underestimated by . 3% in the ﬁrst energy bin6 and negligible
at higher energies.

and 5% have Etrue/eV in [1018.5, 1018.6). Compared to the data in ref. [4], this model underestimates the total
ﬂux with Etrue/eV ∈ [1018.6, 1018.7) by 5% and that in [1018.5, 1018.6) by 25%.

B.1 Eﬀect of the choice of the SD energy resolution

The energy resolution of the SD, required for the forward-folding procedure, can be estimated
either from shower and detector simulations (but with possibly strongly model-dependent
results) or directly from the calibration data (but with large statistical uncertainties especially
at the highest energies). Throughout this work we used the data-based parameterization of
eq. (B.4), but in order to assess how sensitive our ﬁt is to this choice, we also tried using the

for the vertical SD resolution, which exceeds the data-based one by about twice the statistical
standard deviation of the latter. (We did not change the inclined SD resolution.) We found
the eﬀects of this to be negligible, with the best ﬁt at the same (γ, log10 Rcut) pair to within our
grid spacing (but with slightly narrower lower uncertainty intervals, 0.96+0.08
−0.11 and 18.68+0.02

with the same mass fractions to within 0.4%, and with the same total deviance to within
