Abstract 

Understanding defect effect on carrier dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and 

potential applications of transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, the phenomenon of oxygen 

impurities trapping photo-excited carriers has been studied with ultrafast pump-probe 

spectroscopy. Oxygen impurities are intentionally created in exfoliated multilayer MoSe2 with 

Ar+ plasma irradiation and air exposure. After plasma treatment, the signal of transient 

absorption first increases and then decreases, which is a signature of defect capturing carriers. 

With larger density of oxygen defects, the trapping effect becomes more prominent. The trapping 

defect densities are estimated from the transient absorption signal, and its increasing trend in the 

longer-irradiated sample agrees with the results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. First 

principle calculations with density functional theory reveal that oxygen atoms occupying Mo 

vacancies create mid-gap defect states, which are responsible for the carrier trapping. Our 

findings shed light on the important role of oxygen defects as carrier trappers in transition metal 

dichalcogenides, and facilitates defect engineering in relevant material and device applications.

   In the past few years, layered materials transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted 

numerous research interests due to their extraordinary properties, such as direct bandgap in 

monolayer samples1, stable excitons and trions at room-temperature2, superior immunity to short 

channel effects3, and strong spin-valley coupling4, which make TMDs promising for applications 

in nano- and flexible electronics, photonics, and valleytronics. For many of these TMD-based 

devices, it is essential to understand the physics of carrier-related interactions5, and to acquire 

carrier transport properties that determine the key performance metrics (bandwidth, 

responsivity), such as carrier lifetime6, diffusion coefficient7 and mobility8.  

   Defects inside TMDs or from their environments (substrates, surface adsorbates) can interact 

with excitons/carriers, and significantly affect the functionalities of the electronic devices. For 

example, the chalcogen vacancy defect9 and its related complex10 are able to activate additional 

defect-associated photoluminescence (PL) channels, which can decrease the intrinsic exciton PL 

efficiency.  Charged impurity scattering due to either the ionized impurities inside TMDs11 or 

charge traps at the surface of the substrate12 has been proposed to be the dominant factor for the 

observed low room-temperature mobility in TMDs devices. Charge traps at the TMD-gate 

insulator interface have also been suggested as the cause of hysteresis in TMD-based field effect 

transistors13. Some defects can also serve as recombination centers, assisting the recombination 

of the photo-excited excitons/carriers in exfoliated few-layer and multilayer TMDs via Auger 

scattering14-15.  

    Even though the defect trapping effect from oxygen impurities was proposed to be responsible 

for the previously observed phenomena in CVD-grown monolayer and multilayer MoSe2

16, 

direct evidence and mechanisms about how these impurities are introduced into the samples, and 

more importantly, their effects on the electronic band structure and carrier dynamics are still not 

fully understood. In this letter, we intentionally created oxygen defects in exfoliated multilayer 

MoSe2 by plasma irradiation, and then studied and verified the effect of the generated oxygen 

defects on the photo-excited carrier dynamics with femtosecond laser pump-probe spectroscopy. 

As expected, the optical signature of carriers being trapped by mid-gap defects is observed after 

plasma irradiation, and the defect-capturing-carrier effect increases with larger oxygen defect 

density. Our experimental findings, along with a band structure calculation with density 

2 

 
    
functional theory, confirms the carrier-trapping role of oxygen impurities in TMD materials, and 

provides important implication for defect engineering in TMD-based devices.   

   Multilayer MoSe2 samples were mechanically exfoliated from commercially purchased MoSe2 

crystal (2D Semiconductors) onto SiO2/Si substrate using scotch tape. Since it has been found 

that the defect trapping exciton/carrier phenomenon occurs regardless of the sample thickness16, 

indicating that the sample thickness is not a crucial factor, a relatively thick flake (80 nm 

thickness confirmed by AFM, see supplementary material) with lateral dimensions > 20 um was 

chosen in order to have enough sample area for the laser spot (20 um in diameter).  

   Plasma irradiation is an effective means to generate defects in TMD materials17 or reduce the 

thickness of layered materials18. It has been demonstrated that oxygen impurity can be created in 

MoS2 samples after Ar+ plasma treatment19. Initially the Ar+ plasma generates vacancies and new 

edges defects, then the vacancies and the new edges will be occupied or oxidized by oxygen 

atoms once exposed to air. Following this method, we performed two sequential Ar+ plasma 

irradiations on our MoSe2 sample using a reactive ion etcher (Plasma-Therm 790 RIE). The 

recipe used in the plasma treatment was 50 W power, 200 mTorr pressure, 20 sccm Ar flow rate, 

but with 30 s irradiation time for the 1st treatment and 300 s for the 2nd treatment. In order to 

verify the generation of defects, as well as identify the defect species, we measured the samples 

with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after each plasma treatment, as shown in Figure 1. 

Before plasma irradiation, Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 peaks, located at 228.5 eV and 231.6 eV 

respectively, and Se3d5/2 and Se3d3/2 peaks, located at 54 eV and 54.8 eV respectively, can be 

observed. Theses peak positions agree with the reference values of Mo-Se bonding 20-21. After 

the 1st plasma treatment (30s), four new peaks appear, located at around 232.3 eV, 235.4 eV, 

58.6 eV and 59.4 eV respectively. Comparing with the literature results22-23, two of these peaks 

originate from electrons in the Mo3d shell with j=5/2 and j=3/2 in Mo-O bonds, and the other 

two peaks from electrons in the Se3d shell with j=5/2 and j=3/2 in Se-O bonds, respectively. The 

observation of these peaks indicates that we have successfully created oxygen impurities with 

chemical bonds to both Mo and Se atoms in the material. After the 2nd plasma treatment, for 

which the irradiation time is 10 times than the 1st treatment, the relative intensities of the Mo-Se 

bonding peaks decreases while those of the Mo-O and Se-O bonding peaks increases. This 

3 

 
indicates that more Mo-Se bonds were destroyed and more oxide bonds were created, i.e. the 

density of oxygen impurities increases, by the longer irradiation time.  

Figure 1. XPS data of MoSe2 sample before and after plasma irradiation. Peaks of Mo-O and Se-O bonds 
can be clearly seen after plasma irradiation, and the relative intensity of these oxygen bonding peaks 
increase after the second plasma treatment.  

The controllable generation of oxygen impurities allows us to investigate their effect on carrier 

dynamics by directly comparing the differential reflection signals before and after plasma 

treatments. We measured the differential reflection, ∆R/R0=(R-R0)/R0, with femtosecond laser 

pump-probe spectroscopy, where R0 and R are the reflections before and after the excitation by 

the pump pulse, respectively. The laser pulses are generated from a Ti: Sapphire femtosecond 

laser oscillator, with about 100 fs pulse width, 800 nm central wavelength, and 80 MHz 

repetition rate. Figure 2a shows the obtained ∆R/R0 signals at different pump fluences before 

plasma treatments. All the signals show negative exponential decays. Figure 2b illustrates the 

carrier generation and relaxation dynamics in bulk MoSe2

24. Since the energy difference between 

the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) at the K point is 

around 1.5eV, we can generate and detect electrons and holes in the K valleys nearly-resonantly 

with 800nm pump and probe pulses, respectively. When probing resonantly, the reflection 

change is mainly due to the change in absorption caused by phase-space filling effect25. The 

4 

 
 
 
reflection of multilayer MoSe2/SiO2/Si structures can be calculated by the transfer matrix method 

and the derived expression is26:

air/MoSe2, MoSe2/SiO2, and SiO2/Si interfaces, respectively; 

is the complex 

refractive index of each material (note that positive κ stands for absorption), and 𝜑𝑖 = 2𝜋𝑛̃𝑖𝑑𝑖/𝜆 

is the complex phase shift due to a change in the optical path and the absorption in MoSe2 or Si. 

Using Eq. (1), the relative reflection change, ∆R/R0, is plotted as a function of ∆κ/κ in the inset 

of Figure 2a. It can be seen that the reflection change is proportional to the absorption change 

with a positive slope. Therefore, the observed negative reflection change means that the 

absorption in the sample decreases after the pump excitation, due to the phase-space filling 

effect. When the excited carriers occupy the K valleys and reduce the relevant transitions due to 

Pauli blocking, absorption of the probe becomes less compared with that before pump excitation. 

In Figure 2a, there are two decay components in the negative reflection change signals, with the 

fast one only lasting for several ps and the slow one persisting for several hundred ps. The fast 

decay component can be attributed to carrier redistribution (also called thermalization and 

cooling) via intra-valley and inter-valley scatterings, which are accomplished by numerous 

processes of carrier-carrier scattering and carrier-phonon scattering, as shown in Figure 2b. The 

slow decay component reflects the direct recombination process of the carriers in the K valleys 

after the carrier redistribution, as also shown in Figure 2b25.

   The direct comparison of ∆R/R0 signals before, and after the 1st and 2nd plasma treatments are 

shown in Figure 2c. At low pump fluences, one prominent feature of ∆R/R0 after plasma 

irradiation is the sign change of the signals from negative to positive, indicating the absorption 

first decreases and then increases. Such sign-changing transient signal with the indication of an 

initial decrease followed by an enhancement in absorption has been observed in a number of 

defected materials, such as low temperature grown (LTG) traditional semiconductors by 

molecular beam epitaxy (LTG-GaAs27-28, LTG-InP29, LTG-InGaP29), and CVD grown layered 

MoSe2 films16,  and well accepted as the signature of defect-capturing-carrier phenomenon. As 

shown in Figure 2b, when electrons are just excited into the conduction band, phase-space filling 

effect can cause absorption decrease. However, if the material has a considerable amount of mid-

gap defects, the excited carriers will be quickly captured and trapped by those mid-gap defects. 

Once the electrons are captured, an additional absorption channel for the probe, i.e. the transition 

from the localized defect states which possess broad momenta to high energy states in the 

conduction band, becomes available, leading to an increase in the absorption. In our previous 

study16, oxygen impurities have been proposed to be responsible for the carrier-trapping events, 

because the defect trapping effect could only be observed in CVD grown films but not in 

exfoliated flakes, and the oxygen content is only found in CVD as-grown films. Here, the fact 

that the defect-capturing-carrier signature can again be observed after the generation of oxygen 

impurities in the exfoliated sample by plasma irradiation, serves as strong evidence that oxygen 

impurities in MoSe2 samples are indeed the effective carrier-trapping defects. While the 

negatively decaying black curve in Figure 2c shows the recombination of free K-valley carriers 

in the undamaged sample, the positively decaying red and blue signals in Figure 2c reflects the 

process of carrier releasing from the defect states back to the valence band, as shown in Figure 

2b.  

   The ∆R/R0 signals after the 1st and 2nd plasma treatments at different pump fluences are shown 

in Figure 3a and 3b, respectively. The competition between the trapped carriers and the excess 

free carriers, the defect saturation effect and the defect density can be investigated from the 

pump-fluences dependent ∆R/R0 signals. Figure 3a and 3b show that the sign-changing signals 

can only be observed at low pump fluences. As pump power increases, the ∆R/R0 signals will 

7 

 
 
again become totally negative. This is because when the pump fluence is large enough, the 

excited carrier density will surpass the defect density, so all the defects will be occupied and 

excess free carriers will exist and take effect. In this case, the final ∆R/R0 signal is a result of two 

competing mechanisms: the trapped carriers that contribute positively to the signal via providing 

additional absorption channels; and the free carriers that contribute negatively to the signal 

through Pauli blocking effect. Obviously when the excited carrier density is much larger than the 

defect density, the negative component will be dominant and the signal will become totally 

negative, as shown by the signals taken at high fluences in Figure 3a and 3b.  

   Another interesting feature of the ∆R/R0 signals is the changing trend of the positive plateau 

values. As the pump fluence increases, the plateau value first increases then decreases, and the 

value around that time-delay finally decreases down to the negative region, as marked by the 

dashed lines in Figure 3a and Figure 3b. Using the transfer matrix method, the reflectance at the 

MoSe2 surface (R0), the transmittance into Si substrate (T), and hence the absorbance within the 

MoSe2 (A=1-R0-T) can be calculated30. With the obtained absorbance, we convert the pump 

fluence to the excited carrier density, and plot the ∆R/R0 values along the vertical dashed lines as 

a function of excited carrier density, as shown in Figure 3c. The initially increasing then 

decreasing trend can be seen very clearly. This trend actually reflects the defect saturation effect: 

Before defect saturation, more excited carriers will result in more occupied defects, and hence a 

larger positive signal; After defect saturation, more excited carrier will result in more excess free 

carriers which can compete with the trapped carriers and drag the total signal downward. As a 

result, more excited carrier will lead to more negative signal once the defects are saturated. Thus, 

the trend-turning point indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 3c actually correspond to the 

density of the available trapping-defects in the sample. The estimated defect density after the 1st 

and 2nd plasma treatments are 9.4 × 1016/𝑐𝑚3 and 1.8 × 1017/𝑐𝑚3, respectively. These results 

are consistent with the observation from the XPS data that after the 2nd plasma treatment, the 

oxygen impurities density increases. In other words, when the oxygen impurity density increases, 

the trapping defect density estimated from the ∆R/R0 signal also increase accordingly, which 

serves as another evidence for the carrier-trapping role of the oxygen impurities.  

   Finally, we want to discuss about the specific types of the oxygen impurities in MoSe2. 

Although we have demonstrated that oxygen impurities are responsible for carrier trapping, it is 

8 

 
still not clear which oxygen bonding is relevant, Mo-O (oxygen atoms occupying Se vacancies) 

or Se-O (oxygen atoms occupying Mo vacancies) or both? Shallow defects usually serve as 

donors or acceptors in a material, while deep mid-gap defects can serve as carrier trappers or 

recombination centers31. Thus, the key to answer this question is the defect energy position in the 

band structure, i.e., whether the bonding introduces mid-gap state in the band gap. Theoretical 

calculations with density functional theory (DFT) have shown that both molybdenum and 

chalcogen vacancies can induce mid-gap state within the bandgap32-36. However, the occupation 

of the chalcogen vacancy by oxygen atom (Mo-O bonding) can remove the mid-gap state and 

restore the band structure to a clean defect-free band gap32-34. In oxygen treated MoS2 samples, 

substitution of chalcogen vacancy defects with oxygen atoms (Mo-O bonding) has been shown 

experimentally to improve the PL efficiency32 and enhance carrier mobility37. Therefore, the 

question that remains is whether introducing oxygen atoms into the Mo vacancy sites to form Se-

O bonding will also passivate the mid-gap states or give rise to more of them. We have 

performed DFT calculations to obtain the band structure of bulk MoSe2 with O atoms occupying 

Mo vacancy sites. Details of DFT calculations can be found in the supplementary material. As 

can be seen in Figure 4, after O atoms occupy the Mo vacancy sites, additional defect states that 

located deep inside the original band gap of bulk MoSe2 appear. These mid-gap states can 

typically serve as effective carrier trappers (note that recombination center is just a special case 

of carrier trapper with comparable electron and hole capturing rates)31. Therefore, considering 

together the DFT result and our experimental observations, we can conclude that oxygen 

impurities occupying Mo vacancy sites (and forming Se-O bonding) generate mid-gap defect 

states and play the role of carrier-trapper in MoSe2 material. Our results imply that even the same 

defect species, e.g. oxygen atoms in this case, can have remarkably different effects on band 

structure and carrier dynamics in TMDs, depending on their position in the host lattice. When 

utilizing defect engineering to tune the optical and electrical properties of TMD materials, we 

need to know not only the defect species, but also how these defects interact with the host lattice, 

as both of these aspects are important to realize the desired functionality.

projected density of state for MoSe2 with oxygen atoms in Mo vacancy.  

   In summary, we have successfully created oxygen impurities in exfoliated multilayer MoSe2 by 

Ar+ plasma irradiations. The generation and increase of oxygen defects were confirmed by XPS. 

Transient reflection signals ∆R/R0 before plasma are composed of two negative fast and slow 

decays that reflect the inter-valley scattering and recombination of the excited carrier. The ∆R/R0 

signals after plasma treatment exhibit a rapid sign change from negative to positive, a signature 

of defect trapping carriers, revealing the process of the excited carriers being captured by the 

created oxygen impurities. The density of oxygen impurities can be estimated from the ∆R/R0 

values of the positive plateau, as a function of the density of excited carrier, and the result of 

increased defect density in the longer-irradiated sample agrees with the XPS observation. 

Moreover, DFT calculations show that oxygen atoms in Mo vacancy sites are responsible for the 

mid-gap defect states that accounts for the carrier trapping. Our findings shed light on the 

understanding of charge carrier-oxygen defect interactions in TMD materials, and provide 

important implications for defect-engineering in TMD-based devices.

2. Details of DFT band structure calculations   

The DFT calculations were performed using the projector-augmented wave method with a 

plane-wave basis set as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)1,2. A 

kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was chosen. The k-mesh grid of 7x7x1 for the sampling of the 

first Brillouin zone of the supercell was selected according to Monkhorst-Pack type meshes, with 

the origin being at the Γ point for all computations except the band structure computation.3 The 

local density approximation (LDA) was used for the exchange-correlation potential.3,5 Van der 

Waals’ forces were also simulated due to the absence of covalent bonding between the layers4. In 

our computations, we have adopted the DFT-D2 scheme to model the non-local dispersive forces 

wherein a semi-empirical correction is added to the conventional Kohn-Sham DFT theory5. A 

2x2 supercell of bulk MoSe2 was constructed with an O-atom incorporated into Mo-vacancy site. 

Atomistic relaxations were allowed to converge when the Hellmann-Feynman forces on the 

atoms were less than 0.005 eV/Ang. In previous studies, Mo-vacancy in TMDs has shown to 

introduce defect states in the nominal band gap of TMD material.3,5 In our simulations, the 

highest occupied state of the system with vacancies serves as the zero- energy reference in these 

0 K simulations.
