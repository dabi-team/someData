Abstract.

In this paper, we investigate features of the ground state of some nuclei far
from the stability for isotope chains with proton numbers Z=18 and 20. Our aim is to
predict the eventual existence of magic numbers in these exotic nuclei. For this purpose,
we use two methods: the non relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach based
on SLy4 Skyrme functional and the relativistic (so-called covariant) density functional
theory (CDFT) by using the DD-ME2 force parametrization. We compare our results with
the available experimental data and with the predictions of other models such as Finite
Range Droplet Model (FRDM). Our present investigation predicts that N=32 and N=40
are magic numbers for Ar and Ca isotopes.

Keywords: Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method (HFB); Relativistic density functional theory

1. Introduction

Nowadays, nuclear structure continues to be an active area of research in nuclear physics.
Previously, the study of the structure of the Nucleus has rested on stable nuclei or those
located near the valley of stability. However, over the years, the ﬁeld of investigation of
the structure of the nucleus has been extended to exotic nuclei. Nuclear models, which are
essentially based on nuclei close to stability, diverge as stability limits are approached. This
gave rise to new theories that are developed to describe stable nuclei and applied for some
exotic ones.

Generally, the new nuclear theories can be grouped into two diﬀerent approaches: ab-
initio methods [1, 2] and relativistic[3, 4, 5, 6] or non-relativistic[7, 8, 9] mean ﬁeld theories.
In the former case, thanks to the advances of the computing facilities, we can study with
success the light nuclei. In the past 15 years or so there has been a lot of eﬀort invested in ab-
initio methods (e.g., QMC methods, coupled cluster methods, no-core shell model) and much

progress is being made toward the description of medium-mass nuclei [10, 11, 12]. However,
their use for the description of heavy nuclei is still limited because of the complexity of
the calculations. Currently , there are methods developed to bridge the ab-initio and DFT
approaches[13, 14].
In the latter case, mean ﬁeld theories are less complicated and they
described nuclear properties successfully. For these reasons, they are mostly used to study
nuclear structure.

In the present work, we concentrate on mean ﬁeld theories by choosing the non-
relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogliubov method and covariant density functional theory
(CDFT) in order to predict and discuss the signature of new magic numbers in even-even
20Ca and 18Ar nuclei located far from the stability.

As it is known, the magicity in nuclei can be changed locally in those which are far
away from the stability line. Therefore, the known magic numbers for nuclei located in the
stability valley or very close to it can disappear and new ones can appear instead. Our work
is a part of this current problematic inasmuch as it concerns the discovery of new magic
numbers in the exotic region. Recently, several reviews have studied the emergence of new
shell magic numbers, for example N=16 in Z=8 [15] and N=32 in Z=20 [16, 17]. However,
the other ones are quenching like N=20 in magnesium and neon [18, 19], and N=28 in sulfur
and silicon [20]. Also, a discussion with experimental techniques on magic numbers can be
[22, 23] the
found in the paper by Nakamura et al.
authors emphasized the role of nuclear forces on shell evolution studies.

[21]. In the same context, in Refs.

The paper is organized as follows: a short description of the approaches we have used
for our calculations and the methods to solve them are given in sections 2 and 3. The details
of the input and the interactions used in calculations are provided in section 4. Our results
are presented and discussed in section 5. Finally we give our conclusion in section 6.

2. Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Method

In the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation, the two-body Hamiltonian is essentially
reduced to a sum of two terms: the kinetic energy tij and the anti-symmetric two-body
interaction matrix-elements ¯νijkl. So, in second quantization this Hamiltonian takes the
form[24]:

H =

tijc†

i cj +

¯νijklc†

i c†

(1)

Xijkl

X

with c†
i and ci are single-particle creation and annihilation operators, respectively, and
¯νijkl = hi, j|V |k, li−hi, j|V |l, ki are anti-symmetrized two-body interaction matrix-elements.
The basic idea in the HFB method is to deﬁne ground state of the many-body system as a
vacuum with respect to quasi-particles[26, 27]:

βk|Φi = 0

(2)

Neutron Shell Closure at N=32 and N=40 in Ar and Ca Isotopes

where |Φi is the ground-state wave function, and β and β† are the quasi-particle operators
which can be obtained from the particle operators ci and c†
i by using the general linear
Bogoliubov transformation[24]:

β
β†

=

U † V †
V T U T

!  

(3)

The basic building blocks of the theory are, namely: the one-body density matrix which is
given by:

ρij = hΦ|c†

jci|Φi = (V ∗V T )ij

and the pairing tensor deﬁned as:

κij = hΦ|cjci|Φi = (V ∗U T )ij

(4)

(5)

By applying the variational principle, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (1) is
expressed as an energy functional

E[ρ, κ] =

hΦ|H|Φi
hΦ|Φi

= Tr[(t +

where

The variation of the energy (6) with respect to ρ and κ leads to the HFB equations:

(7)

(8)

where h = t + Γ is the mean ﬁeld Hamiltonian, and ∆ denotes the pairing potential. Later
on, the Lagrange multiplier λ will turn out to be the Fermi energy of the system.
In
practice, it is convenient to transform the standard HFB equations into a coordinate space
representation and solve the resulting diﬀerential equations on a lattice. We can then use
the Skyrme forces[25] to conveniently simplify further the HFB equations. So, in coordinate
space the HFB energy (6) has the form of local energy density functional:

E[ρ, ˜ρ] =

d3rH(r),

Z

The Hamiltonian H(r) is composed of several terms

H = K + H0 + HLS + HC

(9)

(10)

The ﬁrst term is the kinetic energy, the second one corresponds to the density-dependent
and the third term represents the ﬁnite-range spin-orbit. Finally, HC denotes the coulomb

term. The variation of the energy (9) according to the particle local density ρ and pairing
local density ˜ρ results in Skyrme HFB equations:

˜h(rσ, rσ′)

h(rσ, rσ′)
˜h(rσ, rσ′) −h(rσ, rσ′) !

The local ﬁelds h(rσ, rσ′) and ˜h(rσ, rσ′) can be easily calculated in coordinate space (See
Refs [24, 28, 29] for more details).

3. Covariant density functional theory

The Covariant density functional theory (CDFT) is a modern theoretical tool for the
description of the ground state properties of nuclei. There are three classes of covariant
the nonlinear meson-nucleon coupling model (NL)[31], the
density functional models:
density-dependent meson-exchange model (DD-ME)[32] and the density-dependent point-
coupling model (DD-PC)[33]. In the framework of this paper we have used DD-ME class
with ﬁnite masses leading to ﬁnite-range interactions. The starting point of CDFT for these
models is a standard Lagrangian density[34]

The most successful EDF (Energy Density Functionals) originates from the Relativistic
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (RHFB) model
in which p-h and p-p channels are treated
simultaneously in a self-consistent manner. In RHFB model, the CDF energy functional is

determined by the expectation of the system Hamiltonian H with respect to the ground-state
wave function |Φi:

E = hΦ|H|Φi

(14)

The variation of the energy functional given by eq (14) with respect to Dirac spinor ψ(r)
leads to RHB (Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov) energy density functional as:

ERHB[ρ, κ] = ERM F [ρ] + Epair[κ] ,

where ERM F [ρ]

This work is realized by employing two methods:
the non relativistic Hartree-Fock-
Bogoliubov (HFB) approach based on SLy4 Skyrme functional[30] by using the HFBTHO
(v2.00d)[40] computer code and the relativistic (covariant) density functional theory
(CDFT) based on the DD-ME2 force parametrization[32] by using the DIRHBZ[34]
computer code.

4.1. Method 1: Numerical implementation of the non relativistic HFB equations

Presently, the most widely used eﬀective theories are the HFB approach with either Skyrme
or Gogny interactions and the relativistic mean ﬁeld model. We choose the HFB approach
with Skyrme force for the present work. In this case, the pairing force, in the particle-particle
(pp) channel[38, 39, 40], is given by:

pair = V n,p
vn,p

0

1 − α

"

β

ρ(r)
ρc (cid:19)

#

(cid:18)

δ(r − r′)

(23)

where ρ(r) is the local density and ρc = 0.16f m−3 is the saturation density of symmetric
inﬁnite nuclear matter (INM). The factor α enables one to change the properties of the
pairing force: if it is equal to 0, the pairing force has pure volume character and does not
depend on the isoscalar density; if it is set to 1, the pairing force is only active at the
surface; if is ﬁxed to 0.5, the pairing force has mixed volume-surface characteristics. Here
we choice α=0.5. The parameter V n,p
is the value of the pairing strength for protons and
neutrons which can be adjusted phenomenologically by ﬁtting. In order to avoid nonphysical
divergences, the deﬁnition of the force involves also an energy cut-oﬀ parameter in the
valence single-particle space to limit the active pairing space above the Fermi level to one
major shell.
In the present study we have used the energy cut-oﬀ parameter equal to
60 MeV, and we have employed the SLy4 parametrization [30]. This parametrization has
been introduced by the Saclay-Lyon collaboration in the 90’s. It performs well for the total
energies, radii, and moments, and it is also reliable when it comes to predictions of long
isotopic sequences. Table 1 summarizes the parameters of this parametrization.

and calcium isotopes. For this purpose we have used the code HFBTHO v2.00d[40] that

solves the Skyrme Hartree-Fock (HF) or Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations
by using the cylindrical transformed deformed harmonic oscillator basis. This program
iteratively diagonalizes the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov Hamiltonian based on generalized
Skyrme-like energy densities and zero-range pairing interactions until a self-consistent
solution is found.

To study the convergence of the HFBTHO results in nuclei under investigation, we
calculated the binding energy BE and the neutron rms radii rn as functions of the number
of shells Nsh for the neutron-rich nuclei 60Ca and 50Ar (see Figure 1). As shown in this

the HFB+SLy4 calculations for 60Ca (left panels) and 50Ar (right panels) as functions of
the number of shells Nsh.

Figure, when we increase Nsh, both the binding energy and the neutron rms radii converge
at Nsh = 14. Therefore, all performed calculations by using the code HFBTHO v2.00d have
been carried out in a full spherical basis of Nsh = 14 oscillator shells (the number of basis
states is Nstates = 680). The oscillator frequency was ﬁxed at 1.2~ω for ~ω0 = 41/A1/3MeV .
The HO basis implies that there are no continuum states modeled. And as the
convergence of the results is conﬁrmed, the eﬀect of the continuum state is only a minor
issue for most of the present results, but it could aﬀect the results for the drip-line Ar
isotopes near N=40. Many authors have studied the role of the coupling to the continuum,
see, e.g., the continuum-HFB results reported in ref. [41] and the review of Okolowicz et al.
in ref. [42] in the context of the shell model, or the review by Forssen et al in ref [43].
The value of the deformation β is taken from the column β2 of the Ref [44]. The number

of Gauss-Laguerre and Gauss-Hermite quadrature points was NGL = NGH = 40, and
the number of Gauss-Legendre points for the integration of the Coulomb potential was
NLeg = 80.
In this work the pairing strength V p,n
for both protons and neutrons has been adjusted
to reproduce well the experimental binding energies, then by ﬁtting the obtained values of
V p,n
to N, we have found the following formulas appropriate for each one among the nuclei

4.2. Method 2: Numerical implementation of the RHB equations

Here, the used computer code is DIRHBZ[34]. Analogously to HFBTHO code[40], the RHB
equation is solved in the conﬁgurational space of harmonic oscillator wave functions with
appropriate symmetry, whereas the densities are computed in coordinate space.
By the same principle previously used in the case of HFTHO, we found that the DIRHBZ
results converge when the numbers of oscillator shells for fermions and bosons are set to
NF = 12 and NB = 20, respectively (see Figure 2). The β-deformation parameter for the
harmonic oscillator basis as well as for the initial Woods-Saxon potential is set to 0. The
method can be applied to spherical, axially and non-axially deformed nuclei. Here, we show
results of calculations for ground states properties using the axially symmetric quadrupole
deformation based on the eﬀective interaction density-dependent meson-exchange (DD-
ME2). The parameters of this interaction are given in table 2:

5. Results and Discussion

Recent measurements of exotic nuclei features at facilities for radioactive ion beams have
revealed that the magic numbers may change locally in those exotic nuclei leading to
disappearance of classic magic numbers (2, 8, 20, 28, 50 and 126)[35] and appearance of
new ones.

Several quantities allow describing well the shell closure in neutron rich nuclei, among
which we can cite: one and two-neutron separation energies Sn and S2n, two-neutron shell
gap δ2n, neutron pairing gap ∆3n and pairing energy. The existence of a magic number is
signed either by the sudden jump in S2n or by a spectacular increase of δ2n and of ∆3n.
Moreover, the pairing energy vanishes for magic nuclei.

In our work we used, for comparison, the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM)[46] and

the available experimental data[47].

5.1. Two-neutron separation energies

The ﬁrst indication for shell closure is two-neutron separation energy S2n which is deﬁned
by:

S2n(Z, N) = B(Z, N) − B(Z, N − 2)

(25)

where B(Z,N) is the positive value of binding energy of a nucleus with Z protons and N
neutrons. Figure 3 displays the variation of two-neutron separation energy for argon and
calcium isotopes as a function of the neutron number N obtained in HFB calculations where
SLy4 parametrization has been used and in CDFT calculations based on DD-ME2 force,
and we compare them with the FRDM model and the available experimental data taken
from Ref [47]. From this ﬁgure, the HFB+SLy4 and the CDFT+DD-ME2 calculations and
FRDM predictions give, approximately, similar results in agreement with the experimental
data. Except for Ar, we observe that the microscopic calculations predict N=20 as closure,
but the FRDM and the experiment suggest that N=18 is a magic number, as clearly seen

on the Figure 3. Also, it is clear that two separation energy S2n presents a remarkable jump
at the known classic magic number N=28 for 20Ca and 18Ar isotopes. A similar behavior is
observed around N = 32 and N=40 for both investigated nuclei. This behavior corresponds
to the appearance of closed shells around N=32 and N=40.

Furthermore, the neutron number N=14 observed in oxygen (see Ref [?]) as a magic
number, is also conﬁrmed by our calculations. In contrast, in calcium and argon isotopes no
shell eﬀects can be seen at N = 16 and 26, that were predicted as a shell gap in oxygen[49].
It is important to note that FRDM predictions fail to reproduce some shell closures

such as N=14, N=32 and N=40.

5.2. One-neutron separation energy

Another physical quantity that can show discontinuities (drop) when crossing a shell closure
is the one-neutron separation energy Sn, deﬁned as:

Sn(Z, N) = B(Z, N) − B(Z, N − 1)

(26)

Figure 4 shows one-neutron separation energies Sn as a function of the neutron number. Our
HFB and CDFT results are compared with predictions of FRDM model and experimental
data. In general, the agreement between our calculations and FRDM theory and available
experimental data is nicely good.

Figure 3: Two-neutron separation energies as a function of neutron number N for Ca isotopes
(left panel) and Ar isotopes (right panel), obtained by non relativistic HFB with SLy4
parametrization and CDFT with DD-ME2 force calculations, and compared with FRDM
predictions and available experimental data.

For the results shown in Figure 4, one can observe a signiﬁcant drop in the separation
energies for the well known classic magic numbers N=20 and N=28 in 20Ca and 18Ar
isotopes. Also, one can see a clearly jump in Sn values at N=32 and 40 in these nuclei.

These observations indicate a change of structure in exotic region and conﬁrm the

appearance of new closed shells at N=32 and N=40.

Again, the closed shell around N=14 is also observed, while for N=16 and 26 is not

observed for both isotopic chains.

Note that local shifts in separation energies can sometimes also be the result of other
causes, e.g. the competition and mixing of diﬀerent nuclear shapes at low energies. Thus,
this quantity alone is not always suﬃcient to establish new closed shells. However, important
additional information can be gained from the study of pairing eﬀect.

5.3. Two-neutron shell gap

A more direct measure of a shell closure is the observation of a peak in the two-neutron
shell gap δ2n:

δ2n = 2B(Z, N) − B(Z, N − 2) − B(Z, N + 2)

(27)

= S2n(Z, N) − S2n(Z, N + 2)

where B and S2n are the binding energy and the two-neutron separation energy, respectively.
In the left panel of Figure 5, we show the 20Ca shell gap δ2n as a function of N. The
maximum values at the classic magic numbers N=20 and N=28 are clearly visible. From
this ﬁgure one can see also a sharp increase in δ2n at neutron numbers N=14, N=32 and
N=40 corresponding to the appearance of new magic numbers in calcium.

The right panel of the Figure 5 shows shell gap as a function of N for argon nucleus.
In this case, one can clearly see the peak in δ2n, obtained by all calculations, for the well
known classic magic number N=28 and for the neutron numbers N=14, N=32 and N=40
which make them as new magic numbers. However, around N=16 and 26, no closed shells
are observed.

Note that the peak at N=18 observed in the Ar data (Figure 5,right panel) is not

reproduced by the microscopic models.

predictions.

5.4. Neutron pairing gap

The stability of nuclei with a magic number of protons or neutrons has direct consequences
on the pairing gap. This quantity is deﬁned by an approximate formula so-called the three-
point gaps ∆3n[3]:

∆3n = πN

where πN = (−1)N is the parity number, B and Sn are the binding energy and the

calculations, HFB+SLy4 and CDFT+DD-ME2, are compared to predictions of FRDM and
the experimental values, which are calculated from the atomic mass evaluation taken from
Ref [47] by using the eq (28). A good agreement between theory and experiment can be
clearly seen for both argon and calcium isotopes

In Figure 6, an abrupt increase can be clearly seen at N=14, N=28, N=32 and N=40
for both nuclei under investigation. From these results, it follows that the conventional
shell closure N=28 persists in 20Ca and 18Ar. Furthermore, the neutron numbers N=32
and N=40, in these nuclei, are new magic numbers that appear in the exotic region. Also,
as discussed in section 5.1, the magic number N=14 was reproduced, and N=16 and 26 are
not observed.

Note that, from Figures 2, 3 and 4 (right panel): Experimentally, N = 20 is not a magic
number in the case of argon isotopes. This result has been reproduced by the FRDM model.
This can be explained by the fact that the inversion of the standard sd-shell conﬁguration
and pf-shell intruder conﬁguration as it has been proved in Refs.
[18, 48] in the case of
32Mg. On the other hand, the microscopic theories show that N = 20 is a magic number.
It seems rather that these theories are failing in this respect. This observation paves the
way for a future investigation.

5.5. Neutron pairing energy

Another method to test the magicity of nuclei is the calculation of the pairing energy. This
energy is given by

Epair = −

1
2

T r(∆κ)

(29)

(cid:132)
(cid:133)
Neutron Shell Closure at N=32 and N=40 in Ar and Ca Isotopes

14

with κ is the pairing tensor and ∆ is the pairing ﬁeld[28]. This energy is very low for magic
nuclei and reaches high values for deformed ones.

In Figure 7, we show the neutron pairing energy for calcium (left panel) and for argon
(right panel) as a function of N. The two calculations, HFB+SLy4 and CDFT+DD-ME2,
produce very similar results.

As shown in Figure 7, our calculated neutron pairing energies vanish for the classic
neutron shell closures N=20 and N=28 for calcium and argon isotopes. This is due to the
weakening of pairing correlations in the case of a magic nucleus. Also, the neutron pairing
energy is exactly zero at N=32 and N=40. So, the Epair allows us to reproduce the classical
neutron magic numbers N=20 and 28 and conﬁrms the appearance of new ones: N=32 and
40.
From the presented results in Figure 7, we can observe clearly a sharp peak at N =14
indicating a neutron shell closure for both nuclei under investigation. Closed shells at N=16
and 26 are always weak.

5.6. Eﬀective pairing gap and pairing tensor.

In HFBTHO calculations, the eﬀective pairing gap deﬁned as the mean value of the pairing
ﬁeld is given by

¯∆ =

T r(∆ρ)
T r(ρ)

(30)

with ρ is the normal one-body density matrix and ∆ is the pairing ﬁeld. Such a deﬁned
eﬀective gap has the same behavior as the spectral gaps in Ref [3]. While,
in CDFT
calculations, the computer code we have used gives information about pairing eﬀect via the
pairing tensor κ which is given by eq(5).

Both Eﬀective pairing gap and pairing tensor are exactly zero for closed shell nuclei
and their adjacent number. As shown in Figure 8, it is seen that when approaching the
classic neutron magic numbers N=20 and N=28, the values of ¯∆ and κ vanish. A similar
eﬀect is seen around the neutron number N=32 and N=40, which correspond to new closed

Neutron Shell Closure at N=32 and N=40 in Ar and Ca Isotopes

15

shells.
Also, from the results displayed in Figure 8, it is quite apparent that a shell closure is
appearing at N=14 for both calcium and argon. Around N=16 and N=26, the values of ¯∆
are not zero, so there are no closed shells in this region.

5.7. Single-particle spectrum

The single-particle levels around the Fermi surface of the 20Ca and 18Ar nuclei, shown
in Figure 10 have been calculated with CDFT+DD-ME2. It can be seen, that the gaps
between the neutron 1p1/2 and 1d5/2, 1d3/2 and 1f7/2, and 1p1/2 and 1d5/2 states are
signiﬁcant enough to make a shell closure at N=8, N=20 and N=20, respectively. Also, the
size of the N=14 (ν1d5/2 − ν2s1/2), N=32 (ν2p3/2 − ν1f5/2) and N=40 (ν2p1/2 − ν1g9/2)
gaps, which is almost similar for both nuclei 20Ca and 18Ar, provides a similar be-
havior at classic magic numbers (20 and 28). Such a result corroborates our previously
obtained ones in Secs. 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 for the magic numbers N=32 and N=40.

As the single-particle spectrum is sensitive to the tensor force we redid the calculation
by the EV8 code that takes into account the eﬀect of this force. As shown in Figure 9 The
results obtained conﬁrmed the magicity of the Ar and Ca nuclei at N = 32 and N = 40.

6. Conclusion

In summary, the appearance of new shell closures in neutron-rich nuclei is studied by using
two diﬀerent approaches: the non relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach
with SLy4 Skyrme force and a new generalized formula for pairing strength V p,n
for both
protons and neutrons, and the covariant density functional theory (CDFT) by using the DD-
ME2 force. The obtained results reproduced nicely the available experimental data. Based
on the one- and two-neutron separation energies, two-neutron shell gap, neutron pairing gap,
neutron pairing energy, eﬀective pairing gap and pairing tensor, we reproduced the classic
magic numbers N=20 and N=28 and predicted that N=32 and N=40 are new ones in argon
and calcium isotopes. In addition, as was obtained in Ref [?], the shell closure at N=14
observed in oxygen was conﬁrmed for calcium and argon in our investigation. Moreover,
in the case of argon isotopes, N = 20 was not found to be a magic number neither in the
experience nor in the FRDM predictions. This is, probably, due to the inversion of the
standard sd-shell conﬁguration and pf-shell intruder conﬁguration as it has been proved in
32Mg. However, the microscopic theories suggest N = 20 as a magic number.
It seems
rather that these theories are failing in this respect. This observation paves the way for a
future investigation.
