ABSTRACT
It remains challenging to detect the low surface brightness structures of faint high-z galaxies, which
is key to understanding the structural evolution of galaxies. The technique of image stacking allows
us to measure the averaged light proﬁle beneath the detection limit and probe the extended structure
of a group of galaxies. We carry out simulations to examine the recovery of the averaged surface
brightness proﬁle through stacking model HST/ACS images of a set of galaxies as functions of S´ersic
index (n), eﬀective radius (Re) and axis ratio (AR). The S´ersic proﬁle best ﬁtting the radial proﬁle
of the stacked image is taken as the recovered proﬁle, in comparison with the intrinsic mean proﬁle of
the model galaxies. Our results show that, in general, the structural parameters of the mean proﬁle
can be properly determined through stacking, although systematic biases need to be corrected when
spreads of Re and AR are counted. We ﬁnd that S´ersic index is slightly overestimated and Re is
underestimated at AR < 0.5 as the stacked image appears to be more compact due to the presence
of inclined galaxies; the spread of Re biases the stacked proﬁle to have a higher S´ersic index. We
stress that the measurements of structural parameters through stacking should take these biases into
account. We estimate the biases in the recovered structural parameters from stacks of galaxies when
the samples have distributions of Re, AR and n seen in local galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION
The evolution of galaxies are found both theoret-
ically and observationally to correlate with stellar
mass (e.g., Kauﬀmann et al. 2003; Bundy et al. 2006;
Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Guo & White 2008; Peng et al.
2010), yielding fundamental relationships between stellar
mass and color (Baldry et al. 2004), size (Shen et al.
2003), metallicity (Tremonti et al. 2004) and star forma-
tion rate (Brinchmann et al. 2004) among local galaxies
(see Blanton & Moustakas 2009, for a review). These
relationships evolve signiﬁcantly out to high redshifts
(e.g., Erb et al. 2006; Zheng et al. 2007; Brammer et al.
2011; Wuyts et al. 2010; Wuyts et al. 2011; Shapley
2011, and references therein). Much eﬀort has been
made to characterize the structural properties of galaxies
at diﬀerent cosmic epochs in order to dissect diﬀerent
physical processes regulating galaxy evolution (Conselice
2014). The size of massive galaxies has been found
to increase on average by a factor of ∼ 3 − 5 since
z ∼2 (e.g., Trujillo et al. 2006; Trujillo et al. 2007;
Toft et al. 2007; Zirm et al. 2007; van der Wel et al.
2008; Mancini et al.
2011;
Newman et al. 2012; Krogager et al. 2013; Belli et al.
2014; van der Wel et al. 2014).
van Dokkum et al.
(2010) found that an extended stellar halo around
massive galaxies was gradually built up over cosmic

time, suggesting that accretion of satellite galaxies plays
a key role in governing the size growth of the massive
galaxies (Naab et al. 2009; Oser et al. 2010). While
physical interpretations of the dramatic size evolution
are still under debate (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2010), the
spatially-resolved brightness proﬁle as a function of
redshift turn out to be crucial to unveiling the assembly
histories of galaxies (e.g., Trujillo et al. 2011; Hilz et al.
2013). In particular, the brightness proﬁles of low-mass
galaxies at high-z are poorly explored.

It is technically challenging to measure the bright-
ness proﬁles towards large radius for typical (L∗)
and low-mass galaxies at high redshifts even with
deep imaging of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
(Szomoru et al. 2012). The size of galaxies may be
underestimated if the extended structure of low surface
brightness is not detected (e.g., Ferguson & Binggeli
1994; Bezanson et al. 2009; Naab et al. 2007, 2009;
Mancini et al. 2010).
Stacking is a powerful tool to
suppress background noise and detect ﬂuxes beneath the
detection limit for individual objects. It has been applied
successfully in studies with optical (e.g., Zibetti et al.
van der Wel et al.
2004;
van Dokkum et al.
2008;
2010),
infrared (e.g., Zheng et al. 2006; Lee et al.
2010; Bourne et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2013), and ra-
dio (e.g., White et al. 2007; Garn & Alexander 2009;
Hancock et al. 2011) imaging data. van Dokkum et al.
(2010) examined the systematical eﬀects in parame-
terizing the mean structure of massive galaxies via
stacking ground-based images, ﬁnding that the averaged
size and S´ersic index can be recovered when each of
the stacked galaxies is characterized by a single S´ersic
proﬁle.
In practice, galaxies tend to have multiple
components (e.g., bulge+disk) with diﬀerent surface
brightness proﬁles; galaxies of similar stellar masses have

eﬀective radius and/or axis ratio (or inclination angle)
spanning over a range (Shen et al. 2003; Hao et al.
2006; Padilla & Strauss 2008). Further investigation
is demanded to address how the scatter in eﬀective
radius, axis ratio and S´ersic index eﬀect on the recovered
structural parameters from the stacked images and to
which extent the results of stacking are accurate and
robust.

In this paper, we present the results of our simulation
to characterize the dependences of the averaged struc-
tural parameters of faint galaxies derived from stacking
on eﬀective radius (Re), axis ratio (AR), index of S´ersic
proﬁle (n), and the distributions of these parameters.
We describe our methodology in Section 2. In Section 3
we present the simulation results. We discuss our results
and summarize them in Section 4. We assume a cosmol-
ogy with H0=70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩM =0.3, and ΩΛ=0.7
throughout this paper.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1. Galaxy Models
The existing deep optical and near-infrared imaging
data from large surveys with HST,
including GEMS
(Rix et al. 2004), COSMOS (Scoville et al. 2007b) and
CANDELS (Grogin et al. 2011), provide the basis for a
stacking analysis of faint high-z galaxies.
In particu-
lar, the HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imag-
ing of COSMOS over 1.48 deg2 (Koekemoer et al. 2007)
through the F 814W (i) ﬁlter allows for morphological
examination for large samples of galaxies. In our simula-
tions, we adopt a pixel size of 0.′′05 (same as HST/ACS
pixel size) and ACS Point Spread Function (PSF) in the
i band to generate galaxy model images. A physical scale
of 100 kpc then corresponds to [280, 250, 239] pixels at
z=[0.7, 1, 2]. A size of 351 × 351 pixels is chosen for the
model images to have the radial surface brightness proﬁle
extended to R = 50 kpc and have background estimation
out to R = 70 kpc for galaxies at z > 0.7.

Three structural parameters are used to characterize
the two-dimensional model image of a galaxy: index of
S´ersic proﬁle (n), eﬀective radius (Re) and axis ratio
(AR) . Position angle is randomly chosen between 0 and
180 degrees for AR < 1. The S´ersic proﬁle is described
by

I(r) = I0 exp{−bn[(r/re)1/n − 1]}.

(1)

The axis ratio (AR), deﬁned as the ratio of minor axis b
over major axis a, measures the elongation in morphol-
ogy for early-type galaxies or the inclination for late-type
galaxies. The model galaxy is centered at the centroid
of the image, which is then convolved with the empir-
ical PSF derived from HST/ACS i-band images using
a number of isolated bright stars. The Full Width at
Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF is RPSF = 0.′′11
or 2.2 pixels. The total brightness of the model image
is scaled to match the total ﬂux in analog-digital units
(ADU) for a galaxy ranges from 24 mag to 24.75 mag (i.e.,
a factor of 3 spread in ﬂux) in the HST images from COS-
MOS. We adopt a faint-end slope of −0.47 for early-type
galaxies and −1.37 for late-type galaxies to determine the
distribution of magnitude of the galaxies (Tomczak et al.
2014), and we add photon noise and background noise to
match the noise level in the HST images of COSMOS in

order to address the eﬀect of noise. An IDL code SIM-
ULATE GALAXY.PRO5 (see H¨aussler et al. 2007, for
more technical details) is used to create a galaxy model
image at given n, Re and AR. We also randomly locate
the center of a model galaxy within a pixel to match ob-
servations. A set of galaxy model images are shifted and
aligned to the same center before stacking. Due to the
noises, the measured center of a model galaxy slightly
diﬀers from the actual center. We will discuss the eﬀects
of this issue to the ﬁnal conclusions in Section 3.7.

In practice, the structural parameters are barely known
for individual faint high-z galaxies; the stacked image is
often obtained by directly co-adding the aligned galaxy
images without corrections for inclination, orientation
and size (but see, e.g., Zibetti et al. 2005); the stacked
surface brightness proﬁle is usually derived from the
stacked image using circular apertures. We generate
galaxy models with structural parameters spanning over
suﬃciently wide ranges: 1 ≤ n ≤ 6, 0.′′05 ≤ Re ≤ 0.′′75
and 0.1 ≤ AR ≤ 1.0. Firstly, we examine the measure-
ment of surface brightness proﬁles derived using circular
apertures from a single model image in relations to each
of structural parameters n, Re and AR. Secondly, we
test the recovery of the mean surface brightness proﬁle
when a set of stacked galaxies have two parameters ﬁxed
and the third parameter following a certain distribution.
Each set contains 700 model images, which is represen-
tative of practical cases for stacking. We divide galaxy
models into late-type (1 ≤ n ≤ 2.5) and early-type
(2.5 < n ≤ 6) because the two populations are distinct
in structure (Blanton & Moustakas 2009). We adopt the
log-normal distributions of Re for the two populations
from Shen et al. (2003). The log-normal distribution of
Re is described by the scatter σln(Re) and the median
< Re >. More massive galaxies have larger < Re >.
The AR distribution of late-type galaxies comes from
Padilla & Strauss (2008) and that of early-type galaxies
from Hao et al. (2006) is adopted. At a given AR distri-
bution, the other two parameters n and Re vary across
the corresponding parameter space. When n falls into
1 ≤ n ≤ 2.5 and 2.5 < n ≤ 6 , the AR distribution
of the late-type and of the early-type galaxies are used,
respectively. And Re ranges from 0.′′05 to 0.′′75 (1 to 15
pixels), corresponding to a physical scale of 0.5 to 6.0 kpc
at z = 1. Similarly, we generate each set of model images
for stacking at a ﬁxed n and AR = 1.0 with Re following
the given distribution. Thirdly, we let AR and Re follow
the corresponding distributions and generate models as
functions of n and < Re > to see the integrated eﬀect of
the spreads of these parameters. Finally, we let AR and
Re follow the distributions as described above, and S´ersic
index n follows a uniform distribution between 1 − 2 for
late-type galaxies and 3 − 4 for early-type galaxies. This
simulates the case that faint galaxies are usually selected
by color (or type) and mass (or luminosity), and their
AR, Re, and n often spread over a certain range. Ta-
ble 1 lists the structural parameters of galaxy models
adopted in our simulations. Figure 1 demonstrates the
surface brightness proﬁles of these single-proﬁle models
with AR = 1 for comparison.

Note. — (1) The eﬀective radius Re is given in units of pixels
(0.′′05 per pixel). Here Re = 15 pixels corresponds to a physical
scale of 5.4, 6.0 and 6.3 kpc at z = [0.7, 1, 2], respectively. (2) The
given values of the axis ratio AR correspond approximately to the
inclination angle of 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30 ,20, 10 and 0 for a
disk galaxy. A minimum AR = 0.1 is chosen when the galaxy is
edge-on. (3) Re,0 refers to the median of a log-normal distribution
of Re.

A set of model images for stacking have the same size
of 351 × 351 pixels, with photon noise and background
noise counted. Before stacking a set of model galaxy
images, we ﬁrst measure the positions of the galaxies us-
ing Sextractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) and shift them
to the same position in all images. We note that the
measurement errors of positions and shifting of images
introduce uncertainties into the stacked proﬁle. We also
stack model images free from noise and oﬀsets in posi-
tion to quantify the corresponding uncertainties due to
the noises and errors in aligning the galaxies. Each set
contains 700 galaxy model images and is combined to-
gether using the averaging algorithm. Because the posi-
tion angle of model galaxies is randomly distributed, the
averaged proﬁle is rotationally symmetric. The radial
surface brightness proﬁle is thus suﬃcient to character-
ize the averaged proﬁle. The radial proﬁle is derived from
the stacked image using 21 circular apertures with radii
from 0.5 to 140 pixels evenly split in logarithm. The soft-
ware tool APER.PRO from the IDL Astronomy User’s
library 6 is used to perform aperture photometry. We
use an annulus of R = 6.′′24 to R = 8.′′74 (about 50 to
70 kpc at z ∼ 1) for sky background estimation.

2.3. The Intrinsic Surface Brightness Proﬁle
A measured surface brightness proﬁle usually needs to
correct for the PSF eﬀect in order to obtain the intrin-
sic proﬁle. Instead, we follow Szomoru et al. (2012) to
ﬁt the one-dimensional (1-D) radial surface brightness
proﬁle of a stacked image with a library of 1-D S´ersic

6 http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/

proﬁles convolved by the same PSF. The library is cre-
ated in the same way as we generate galaxy models and
extract their radial proﬁles using circular apertures, cov-
ering 0.′′01 ≤ Re ≤ 1.′′00 in a step of 0.′′01 and 0.1 ≤ n ≤ 8
in a step of 0.1. The method of least squares is used to
select the best ﬁtting and the corresponding S´ersic pro-
ﬁle is taken as the intrinsic proﬁle for the stacked image.
Similarly, the decomposition of a 1-D surface brightness
proﬁle into bulge+disk components can be done by best
ﬁtting the proﬁle with the combination of two distinct
S´ersic proﬁles.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
3.1. The elongation/inclination eﬀects
The elongation (or inclination for disk galaxies) of indi-
vidual stacked galaxies is usually not corrected in stack-
ing. Here we examine how the elongation/inclination
aﬀects the recovery of the structural parameters of a
S´ersic proﬁle. We extract the radial surface brightness
proﬁles using circular apertures from the single-proﬁle
galaxy model images listed in Table 1. We note that
these model images are convolved with ACS PSF. Fig-
ure 2 shows the single-S´ersic proﬁles as functions of n, Re
and AR. The PSF proﬁle is also presented with an arbi-
trary normalization for clarity. Red and blue lines show
AR=0.34 and 0.68 in each panel. We can see that the
surface brightness proﬁle of a galaxy appears to be more
compact at edge-on than at face-on when circular aper-
tures are adopted. The bias becomes larger for late-type
galaxies with larger Re.

We measure the structural parameters from a radial
surface brightness proﬁle using the method described in
Section 2.3. Figure 3 shows the eﬀects of the elonga-
tion/inclination on the recovery of the intrinsic struc-
tural parameters of these galaxy models. When AR=1,
the recovered S´ersic index n and eﬀective radius Re per-
fectly match the input values when the input S´ersic index
is low, but the recovered S´ersic index is lower than the
input value when the input S´ersic index is high. For
model galaxies with high S´ersic index and large eﬀective
radius, the eﬀective radius of the stacked proﬁle tends to
be underestimated. This is because such galaxies exhibit
proﬁles with extended wings out to large radii, leading
to an oversubtraction of the background and thus under-
estimate in both S´ersic index and eﬀective radius. We
plot the fraction of light outside R =125 pixels (about
6.′′25 and ∼ 50 kpc at z ∼1) as a function of S´ersic index
n and eﬀective radius Re in Figure 4. We can see that
for late-type galaxies, the light beyond R = 6.′′25 is neg-
ligible. For early-type galaxies, however, the light out
of R = 6.′′25 dramatically increases with the eﬀective ra-
dius, and reaches up to 10% for galaxies with n = 6 and
Re=15 pixels. This indeed leads to the oversubtraction
of background in our measurements, and consequently to
underestimate of both S´ersic index n and eﬀective radius
Re for early-type galaxies. We note that the underesti-
mate of S´ersic index due to background oversubtraction
can be corrected once a larger annulus is adopted for
background estimate. For a model galaxy with n = 6
and Re=15 pixels, background estimate from out regions
R > 465 pixels (186 kpc at z = 1) may suppress light
contamination from the galaxy to <1%; and the S´ersic
index can be recovered as well as for galaxies with n = 1.

Stacking Galaxy Images

Fig. 3.— Recovery of structural parameters S´ersic index n and
eﬀective radius Re as a function of axis ratio AR. Black squares
(barely seen behind blue circles for late-type galaxies) mark the
starting points at given (n, Re). Color-coded circles represent the
recovered (n, Re) at corresponding AR from the starting points
(black squares).

Figure 3 shows that S´ersic index n is increasingly over-
estimated for galaxies with lower AR (i.e., more in-
clined). The overestimate is signiﬁcant only at AR < 0.5,
and becomes larger for larger Re at small n(n < 2.5),
from ∆n ≤1 when Re=15 pixels (6 kpc at z = 1), to
∆n ≤0.5 when Re=1 pixel. Meanwhile, Re is increas-
ingly underestimated at decreasing AR. The recovered
Re deviates from the intrinsic value by up to 50% at the
minimal AR; and the deviation does not strongly depend
on Re and n.

We conclude that elongation/inclination (AR) inﬂu-
ences the estimate of structural parameters n and Re
when the radial surface brightness proﬁle is extracted
from a galaxy image using circular apertures. The
i.e., with
galaxy would appear to be more compact,
larger n and smaller Re, at decreasing AR, if the elon-
gation/inclination is ignored. We point out that the
bias in recovering structural parameters through stacking
from elongation eﬀects is negligible for early-type galax-
ies (n > 2.5) because the early-type galaxies usually have
AR > 0.5 (at least in the local universe, Hao et al. 2006),
and the main source of bias is from background estima-
tion. For late-type galaxies (n ≤ 2.5), the inclination
leads to overestimate of n and underestimate of Re.

Next step is to test the measurement of the mean sur-
face brightness proﬁle from the stacked image of indi-
vidual galaxy models with two parameters ﬁxed and the
third parameter following a given distribution.

3.2. Eﬀects of AR spread
For each pair of structural parameters (n, Re) listed in
Table 1, a set of 700 galaxy model images are generated
to have the ﬁxed Re and n but AR spreading within
a distribution. We adopt the AR distribution of late-
type galaxies (n ≤ 2.5) from Padilla & Strauss (2008)
and that of early-type galaxies (n > 2.5) from Hao et al.
(2006). These images are stacked together and a radial
surface brightness proﬁle is then obtained. The intrinsic
parameter of the mean proﬁle is given by (n, Re).

Fig. 4.— The fraction of light out of R = 125 pixels as a function
of S´ersic index n and eﬀective radius Re. We can see that the light
in the outer regions is marginal for lat-type galaxies, but increases
as the Re increases for early-type galaxies.

Figure 5 shows the results of our simulation when AR
is spread according to a realistic distribution rather than
ﬁxed. The two empirical AR distributions are shown in
the inner panels. The left plot gives the diﬀerence be-
tween recovered Re and input Re as a function of the
input Re and the right plot presents the deviation of re-
covered n from input n as a function of the input n. The
recovered Re is systematically smaller by 12% to 27%
over 1 ≤ Re ≤ 15 pixels. For late-type galaxies, the de-
gree of underestimate in Re does not depend on Re itself,
suggesting that the AR distribution is responsible for
the underestimate. But for early-type galaxies, the de-
gree of underestimate in Re increases as the Re increases.
Given that the oversubtraction of background becomes
more serious for early-type galaxies with larger size, it is
reasonable to attribute the increase of the degree of un-
derestimate in Re to the oversubtraction of background.
Apparently, the estimate of Re is more biased for late-
type galaxies due to the highly-inclined ones (AR < 0.5)
which are absent in the early-type galaxies when the ef-
fective radius is not very large. Similarly, n is overesti-
mated by up to 20% for late-type galaxies because of the
inclination eﬀect due to those with AR < 0.5. Again, the
overestimate of n does not rely on Re signiﬁcantly. For
early-type galaxies, n can be underestimated up to 15%,
and the underestimation of n increases as n increases. As
most of them are with AR >0.5 in terms of the AR dis-
tribution from Hao et al. (2006), the overestimation of
n can be ignored for early-type galaxies, thus the over-
subtraction of background dominates the estimation of n
and makes n underestimated, especially for galaxies with
larger n which have more extended halo in the outskirts.
As shown in Figure 3, the recovery of n is marginally bi-
ased by inclination/elongation eﬀects at AR >0.5. These
results denote that the function of the AR distribution
regulates the deviation of the recovered Re and n from
the original values for late-type galaxies, and the estima-
tion of background aﬀects the estimation of structural
parameters for early-type galaxies.

Diﬀering from the claim in van Dokkum et al. (2010)
that the recovery of structural parameters is not sensitive

Padilla & Strauss (2008).

Re,0 as functions of Re,0 and input S´ersic index ni. Right plot shows the deviation of the recovered S´ersic index nr relative to ni as
functions of ni and Re,0. Here AR is ﬁxed to unity (face-on).

to the distribution of AR, we show that the AR distri-
bution may signiﬁcant bias the recovery of Re and n, de-
pendent on the fraction of highly-inclined or elongated
ones; the stacked proﬁle appears to be more compact
(i.e., with smaller Re and higher n at the same time) if
the elongation/inclination eﬀect is not corrected.

3.3. Eﬀects of Re spread
Figure 6 shows our simulation results of stacking
model galaxies with a ﬁxed n but Re following a log-
normal distribution. Here AR = 1 is adopted to
get rid of the AR eﬀect. The log-normal distribution
is described by the median Re,0 and scatter σln(Re).
We adopt σln(Re)=0.3 dex for early-type galaxies and
σln(Re)=0.5 dex for late-type galaxies from Shen et al.
(2003). As shown in the left panel of Figure 6, the input
median eﬀective radius Re,0 is well recovered through
stacking for late-type galaxies and early-type galaxies
with small eﬀective radius, but for early-type galaxies
with large radius, the underestimation of Re can be up

to 15% due to the oversubtraction of background. How-
ever, n is increasingly overestimated by up to 60% at
decreasing n. This tendency has no dependence on the
median of the log-normal distribution of Re. For early-
type galaxies, the n can still be underestimated due to
the oversubtraction of background.

One can infer from Figure 6 that the median of a log-
normal distribution of Re can be properly measured from
the stacked proﬁle of galaxies; but the spread of Re leads
to an overestimate of n for late-type galaxies (n ≤2.5).

3.4. Eﬀects of AR and Re spreads
We have shown that the spread of AR biases the
estimates of structural parameters of the mean proﬁle
through stacking, leading the stacked proﬁle to be more
compact, say with smaller Re and higher n; and the
spread of Re does not inﬂuence the estimate of me-
dian Re but deviates n to be higher. The eﬀects of the
two spreads are signiﬁcant only for stacking of late-type
galaxies (n ≤2.5). Now we include both the two spreads

Circles mark the results from Figure 5 that only the AR spread is counted. Triangles show the results when the Re spread is included

for late-type galaxies and 3 − 4 for early-type galaxies. The eﬀective radius is ﬁxed at given value in each stacking set and the axis ratio
AR = 1 is chosen for all sets. The left panel shows the deviation of the recovered eﬀective radius Re,r relative to the input value Re,i as a

in stacking and examine their eﬀects on the recovery of
the structural parameters. Again, AR and Re follow dis-
tinct distributions for early- and late-type galaxies as
mentioned before. We note that the eﬀects of the two
spreads are not correlated with the median Re,0.

Figure 7 shows the results of stacking with both of the
AR and Re spreads involved. We also over plot the re-
sults from Figure 5 and 6 for comparison. We can see
that the mixture of AR and Re spreads biases the esti-
mates of median Re,0 and n in the same way as the eﬀects
of the two spreads combine linearly together. The me-
dian Re,0 is underestimated by 20%-27% and 10%-20%
for late-type and early-type galaxies, depending on the
Re of the galaxies, respectively, caused by the AR spread
and the estimation of background; and n is increasingly
overestimated by up to 70% at decreasing n, equal to a
linear combination of the deviations caused by each of
the two spreads.

In summary, our simulations manifest that the mea-

sured size (Re) and S´ersic index (n) of the averaged pro-
ﬁle by stacking a set of galaxies deviate from the input
values when the stacked galaxies disperse in axis ratio
(AR) and/or half-light radius (Re). The deviations de-
pend on the type of stacked galaxies (n) and distribu-
tion functions of AR and Re. The stacked proﬁle tends
to be more compact for late-type galaxies, and the over-
subtraction of background dominates the estimation of
structural parameters for early-type galaxies and make
the proﬁle to be smaller in both Re and n. With given
distributions of AR and/or Re, the deviations in esti-
mates of Re and n can be quantitatively determined and
thus corrected accordingly.

It is worth noting that the eﬀects caused by the spread
of n depend strongly on the distribution function of n.
The averaged proﬁle of a set of S´ersic proﬁles with ﬁxed
Re and AR=1 is much close to the median one. The
derived n from stacking are rather reliable with uncer-
tainties of <0.5 for both late-type and early-type galaxies

(see the Appendix of van Dokkum et al. 2010, for more
details). We will also discuss this issue in Section 3.5.
However, it remains to be explored when two distinct
types of proﬁles are stacked together.

3.5. Eﬀects of n spread
Generally speaking, a set of galaxies of similar prop-
erties (e.g., stellar mass or color) are often selected for
stacking to derive their mean proﬁle. For instance, galax-
ies are often divided into two populations: star-forming
and quiescent. The star-forming galaxies tend to have
Sersic index between 1 and 2 and the quiescent galax-
ies have Sersic index systematically higher. In order to
test how the spread of n aﬀects the stacked results, we
adopt a uniform distribution of n between 1 − 2 for late-
type galaxies and 3 − 4 for early-type galaxies, with ﬁxed
Re and AR = 1.0. Figure 8 shows that the Re is al-
most identical to the input values for LTGs and small
ETGs, and for large ETGs, the Re can be slightly un-
derestimated due to the oversubtraction of background,
which can be seen from Figure 3. The median S´ersic in-
dex can be recovered well for both late-type galaxies and
early-type galaxies, though the recovered S´ersic index is
slightly lower than the input median S´ersic index for the
early-type galaxies with large eﬀective radius.

3.6. Eﬀects of spreads in AR, Re and n
We account for the spreads in AR, Re and n together
in our stacking exercises, and examine whether the aver-
aged structural parameters can be well recovered through
stacking. Our results shown in Figure 9 denote that the
Re may be underestimated up to 20%−26% for late-
type galaxies but only 10%−15% for early-type galax-
ies. The presence of highly-inclined late-type galaxies
is believed to cause the additional bias to the underes-
timate of the averaged eﬀective radius. The median n
can be well recovered for early-type galaxies, but over-
estimated by δn ∼ 0.7 for late-type galaxies. This is
due to late-type galaxies having larger dispersion in Re
and highly-inclined ones. The early-type galaxies have
smaller dispersion in Re, leading to a smaller overesti-
mate of n, which can be diluted by the underestimation

of n caused by the oversubtraction of background.

3.7. Uncertainties in aligning images
For faint galaxies, the measured position is aﬀected by
noise and thus oﬀset slightly from the true position. In
our stacking analysis, we measure the positions of model
galaxies using Sextractor and shift the galaxies to the
same position in all images before stacking. Figure 10
shows that 68 percentile of the measured positions de-
viate less than 1 pixel from the true positions. At ﬁxed
magnitudes, galaxies with more extended structure (i.e.,
larger eﬀective radius) exhibit larger deviation in measur-
ing their positions. In order to quantitatively estimate
the uncertainties caused by the errors in aligning images,
we repeat the stacking exercises presented in Figure 9
but with model galaxies generated to exactly center at
the same position in all images. No image aligning is
employed here. Figure 11 shows the corresponding re-
sults. We can see that the recovered parameters of the
stacked proﬁles at all Re and n from Figure 11 are nearly
identical to these given in Figure 9, indicating that the
error in aligning galaxy images is not a source to bias
the recovery of the mean structural parameters through
stacking, at least for galaxies with 24 − 24.75 mag and
brighter.

3.8. Stacking bulge+disk galaxies
The composite-type galaxies are commonly composed
of two distinct S´ersic components, i.e., bulge+disk. We
generate bulge+disk galaxy models to test the recovery
of structural parameters through stacking such objects.
We assume that bulges are classical (i.e., de Vaucouleurs
type with n = 4) and disks are exponential (n = 1),
as often used in morphological studies of high-z galaxies
(e.g., Bruce et al. 2012; Lang et al. 2014). The eﬀective
radius of the bulges Re,B is set not to be larger than
the eﬀective radius of the disks Re,D. Here we adopt
Re,D=[5,10,15] pixels and Re,B is chosen accordingly, as
listed in Table 2. A new parameter bugle-to-total light
ratio (B/T ) is used to measure the fraction between the
two components in a galaxy. The B/T is set to be 0.1,
0.2, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.8 and 0.9.

Fig. 11.— Recovery of structural parameters Re and n through stacking galaxies with spreads of all parameter (AR,Re,n) counted and
model galaxies exactly aligned to the same position in all images. The left panel shows the deviation of recovered eﬀective radius < Re >r
relative to the input median eﬀective radius < Re >i as a function of < Re >i for diﬀerent type of galaxies. The right panel shows
the deviation of recovered S´ersic index n relative to the median input median n as a function of the eﬀective radius for diﬀerent type of
galaxies. We can see that There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared with Figure 9, indicating that the centering oﬀset inﬂuences little on
the recovered structural parameters.

We ﬁrstly ﬁt the 1-D proﬁles of individual noise-free
bulge+disk models with single S´ersic proﬁles, select-
ing the recovered proﬁles of best-ﬁt parameters nT and
Re,T. Meanwhile, we also obtain the corresponding sin-
gle S´ersic proﬁles best ﬁtting the 1-D proﬁles of the
bulge+disk models without PSF convolution using the
method presented in Section 2.3. The best-ﬁt proﬁles to
the PSF-free models are taken as the reference proﬁles.
Here AR=1 is adopted for all galaxy models. We do not
include noises in these bulge+disk decomposition exer-
cises in order to test how well the actual parameters of
bulge+disk models can be derived from the 1-D proﬁle
ﬁtting. Secondly, we examine the estimate of structural
parameters through stacking bulge+disk models with
spreads in AR and Re counted only for the disk compo-
nent, aiming at addressing how the recovered structural
parameters depend on the input model parameters. We

stack images of bulge+disk models of given (Re,B, Re,D,
B/T ) with spreads in ARD and Re,D. The ARD spread
in Section 3.2 and the spread of Re for late-type galaxies
in Section 3.3 are adopted. Thirdly, the spread of Re,B
for the bulge component and the ARD and Re,D spreads
for the disk component are taken into account in stacking
bulge+disk models of given (Re,B, Re,D, B/T ). Similarly,
the best-ﬁt S´ersic proﬁle to the 1-D proﬁle of the stacked
image is taken as the recovered proﬁle and the reference
proﬁle is obtained from the best-ﬁt proﬁle with removal
of noise and PSF eﬀect. Table 2 presents the recovered
structural parameters in above three cases for three rep-
resentative values B/T =0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. These stacking
processes deal with the model galaxy images with pho-
ton noise and background included to match the actual
observations.

rameters nT and Re,T as functions of B/T and the ra-
tio of Re,B to Re,D. We point out that the relation-
ships between these parameters are similar for Re,D=5,
10 or 15 pixels and we thus only show the results at

Re,D = 10 pixels.
dex nT is not only tightly correlated with B/T and but
also aﬀected by the sizes of disk and bulge components
for individual bulge+disk models (the left panels). We
notice that the ratio Re,B/Re,D has an eﬀect on nT be-
cause larger Re,B/Re,D (relatively bigger bulge) tends to
lower nT (see also Lang et al. 2014). On the other hand,
the global eﬀective radius Re,T is sensitive to both the
ratio Re,B/Re,D and B/T , and approximately equals to
the light-weighted combination of Re,B and Re,D. When
the bulge+disk models are dominated by one component
(disk or bulge), the recovered structural parameters are
close to these of the dominant component. The recovered
proﬁles (with PSF) are compared with the correspond-
ing reference proﬁles (without PSF) to examine the PSF
eﬀect. The two sets of structural parameters agree well
with each other, indicating that the global structural pa-
rameters of the composite-type galaxies can be properly
recovered using the method of 1-D proﬁle ﬁtting as PSF
eﬀect has little inﬂuence on the recovery of the structural
parameters.

The middle panels of Figure 12 shows nT and Re,T re-
covered from the stacked proﬁles of bulge+disk models
with spreads in ARD and Re,D included. We can see that

the recovered nT and Re,T exhibit signiﬁcant deviations
from those presented in the left panels at B/T < 0.5;
when the disk component increasingly dominates the to-
tal light, nT is increasingly overestimated and Re,T is
more underestimated, and thus the recovered proﬁle ap-
pears to be more compact, suggesting that it is the AR
and Re spreads of the disk component causing the devia-
tions in nT and Re,T, in particular at B/T < 0.5. These
are consistent with the results in Section 3.4. Similarly,
the right panels of Figure 12 shows nT and Re,T recov-
ered from the stacked proﬁles of bulge+disk models ac-
counting for spreads in ARD and Re,Dand Re,B (right).
No signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found from the middle pan-
els, indicating that the bulge size spread Re,B marginally
aﬀects the estimate of global structural parameters.

3.9. Dual-S´ersic Proﬁle Fitting
Resolving high-z galaxies into bulge and disk compo-
nents even in a statistical sense is key to drawing an em-
pirical picture for bulge growth. Here we test the recov-
ery of the structural parameters of the two components
through ﬁtting the global 1-D proﬁle of a stacked image
with bulge+disk composite proﬁles. We test this method
and see how the measurements rely on the parameters of
galaxy models for stacking.
In our two-component ﬁt-
ting, we ﬁx S´ersic index for the bulge (n=4) and the
disk (n=1). Again, the models presented in Table 2 are
used in our simulations. The best ﬁtting is selected us-

ing the least squares method across parameter space of
Re,D, Re,B, and B/T . The best-ﬁt dual-S´ersic proﬁle
provides the recovered structural parameters Re,D, Re,B,
and B/T as the bulge and disk component of a target.
The results of the dual-S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting are shown in
Table 2, in comparison with the input model parameters
when B/T =0.1, 0.5 and 0.9.

The left panel of Figure 13 shows the results of dual-
S´ersic ﬁtting to the 1-D proﬁle of individual bulge+disk
models.
with Re,D = 10 pixels and Re,B=[10, 5,
2.5] pixels. Note that the results are not dependent on
Re,D. One can see that the three key structural parame-
ters Re,D, Re,B and B/T can be properly recovered using
the method of dual-S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting.

Accounting the spreads of AR and Re for the disk
component of bulge+disk models, we derive the struc-
tural parameters of the bulge and disk component of the
stacked image of the models through dual-S´ersic proﬁle
ﬁtting and show the results in the middle panel of Fig-
ure 13. Clearly, the AR and Re spreads aﬀect the recov-
ery of the structural parameters of the two components.
While the average size of the disk component < Re,D >
is systematically underestimated by about 20%, indepen-
dent from B/T , the average size of the bulge compo-
nent < Re,B > is increasingly overestimated at decreas-
ing B/T , particularly for lower Re,B/Re,D. The B/T is
increasingly overestimated at decreasing B/T . These bi-
ases in recovering the structural parameters are obviously
caused by the inclined disks in stacking. The degree of
bias in B/T is strongly dependent on the intrinsic B/T
but free from Re,B/Re,D.

Along with the spreads of AR and R,e added to disks,
the spread in bulge R,e is also included in stacking of
bulge+disk models. The right panel of Figure 13 presents
the recovered structural parameters using the method of
dual-S´ersic ﬁtting to the global 1-D proﬁle of the stacked
model image. Again, the recovered structural parameters
deviate from the input ones. The deviations of < Re,D >,
< Re,B > and < B/T > are similar to what given in the
middle panel of Figure 13, suggesting that the bulge R,e
spread has little inﬂuence on the estimate of the averaged
structural parameters of the stacked bulge+disk models.
And the biases in < Re,B > and < B/T > are mainly
caused by the AR and Re spreads of the disk component.

3.10. Measurements of pseudo-bulges
Not all bulges are classical type with a S´ersic in-
dex of n=4.
In fact, many bulges with smaller
S´ersic indices in the local universe are recognized as
pseudo bulges and thought to be built up through secu-
lar evolution (e.g., Graham 2001; Balcells et al. 2003;
Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004, and references therein).
For high-z galaxies, the bulges formed through inward
migration of disk clumps are expected to diﬀer from the
classical ones which are usually formed via mergers (e.g.,
Bournaud et al. 2007). Since the pseudo bulges are less
distinct from disks compared to the classical bulges, it
is important to examine how the global properties de-
pend on the model parameters and to what degree the
pseudo bulge component can be resolved through a dual-
S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting to a 1-D surface brightness proﬁle.
We therefore repeat the simulations in Section 3.8 but
set n=2.5 for the bulge component.

Again, we derive global structural parameters nT and

Re,T by ﬁtting single S´ersic proﬁles to the simulated pro-
ﬁles in three cases: individual pseudo bulge+disk mod-
els, stacking of pseudo bulge+disk models with AR and
Re spreads added to the disk component, and stack-
ing of such models with Re spread added to the bulge
component and AR and Re spreads added to the disk
component. Table 3 lists the results only for B/T =
[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]. Figure 14 shows recovery results of the
global structural parameters. Similar to those present
in Figure 12: the recovered global nT increases from 1
to 2.5 as B/T increases from 0 to 1; when B/T is ﬁxed,
a lower ratio Re,B/Re,D generally leads nT to be slightly
higher; the global size can be approximately seen as the
light-weighted combination of Re,B and Re,D; the recov-
ered parameters agree well with the reference parameters
( triangles) derived from the PSF-free models; the AR
and Re spreads of the disk component leaves the global
S´ersic index increasingly overestimated and the global
size increasingly underestimated at decreasing B/T ; the
Re spread of the pseudo bulge component has insigniﬁ-
cant inﬂuence to the global structural parameters.

We point out that ﬁtting the stacked proﬁles of pseudo-
bulge+disk models with dual-S´ersic proﬁle results in sim-
ilar results for classical bulge+disk models presented in
Figure 13 if the two S´ersic proﬁles have n = 1 for one
(disk) and n = 2.5 for the other (pseudo bulge). More-
over, it is interesting to see how the recovery of struc-
tural parameters are aﬀected when n = 4 is adopted as
the bulge component in the dual-S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting.
Accordingly, the recovered Re,B, Re,D and B/T as a
function of input B/T are presented in Figure 15, for
individual pseudo bulge+disk models, stacking of these
models with the spreads of AR and Re included into the
disk component, and stacking of these models with AR
spread counted for the disk component and Re spread
for both components, respectively.

When the pseudo-bulge in the pseudo bulge+disk mod-
els is mistaken as a classical one, the bulge+disk de-
composition ends up with an increasing underestimate
of B/T (also Re,B and Re,D) with increasing input B/T .
This is understandable in that the pseudo bulge compo-
nent is divided into a classical bulge and an additional
disk. At Re,B/Re,D < 1, the additional disk biases the
recovered Re,D smaller. Taking the spreads of AR and
Re into account, the recovery of the averaged structural
parameters of < Re,B >, < Re,D > and < B/T > from
the stacked proﬁle of pseudo bulge+disk models is fur-
ther aﬀected mainly by the AR and Re spreads of the
disk, as described in Section 3.9.

4. SUMMARY
Stacking technique is a powerful tool to probe sig-
nals under the detection limit of individual images for
faint galaxies and enable us to obtain the averaged sur-
face brightness proﬁle toward larger radii. We carried
out simulations to test the stacking of galaxy models
with spreads in axis ratio (AR; elongation or inclina-
tion) and eﬀective radius (Re) counted, and to explore
how the recovered structural parameters of the averaged
surface brightness proﬁle depend on the eﬀective radius
(Re), axis ratio (AR), index of S´ersic proﬁle (n) of the
models and their spreads. We also addressed the recov-
ery of averaged structural parameters through stacking
bulge+disk models in order to simulate the real observa-

Stacking Galaxy Images

tions.

In our simulations, we use circular apertures to derive
surface brightness proﬁle of a galaxy image. This is the
usual way for stacking of faint high-z galaxies, whose
structural parameters are barely known so that correc-
tions for inconsistence in inclination, orientation and size
are often ignored. Following Szomoru et al. (2012), we ﬁt
the one-dimensional (1-D) radial surface brightness pro-
ﬁle of a stacked galaxy image with a library of 1-D S´ersic
proﬁles to obtain the best-ﬁt proﬁle using the method of
least squares. The best-ﬁt proﬁle is taken as the intrin-
sic proﬁle for the stacked image. Galaxy models used
in our simulations have structural parameters spanning
suﬃciently wide ranges: 1 ≤ n ≤ 6, 0.′′05 ≤ Re ≤ 0.′′75
and 0.1 ≤ AR ≤ 1.0.

We examined 1) the dependence of the measured sur-
face brightness proﬁle solely on each parameter of n, Re
and AR; 2) the recovery of structural parameters of the
mean surface brightness proﬁle when a set of galaxy mod-
els for stacking have two parameters ﬁxed and the third
parameter spreading within a certain distribution; 3) the
recovery of structural parameters of the mean surface
brightness proﬁle of galaxy models with spreads counted
in both AR and Re as functions of n and mean eﬀective
radius < Re >; 4) the recovery of structural parameters
of the mean surface brightness proﬁle of galaxy models
with spreads added to all parameters, including AR, Re
and n, for late-type and early-type galaxies; 5) the ﬁtting
of the stacked proﬁle of bulge+disk models with both sin-
gle S´ersic proﬁles and dual-S´ersic proﬁles to see to which
extent the stacking can recover the averaged structural
parameters of a galaxy population.

The striking results from our simulations are that the
structural parameters n and Re of the mean-stacked im-
age of a group of galaxies may be biased up to 70% by
spreads in AR and Re, much dependent on the distri-
bution functions of the spreads; the bias can be quanti-
tatively corrected once the spread functions are known.
We summarize our results as follows:

• The spread in AR leads the mean-stacked image of
a group galaxies to appear more compact, i.e., with
a lower mean eﬀective radius < Re > and a higher
n. The inclusion of highly-inclined (or elongated)
galaxies with low AR in stacks biases the recovered
n and < Re >.

• For early-type galaxies with large S´ersic index n,
which have extended halos in the outskirts, the
oversubtraction of background biases the estimate
of structural parameters. The mean S´ersic index
n may be underestimated, and the eﬀective radius
Re may be underestimated for early-type galaxies
with large sizes. This indicates that the estimation
of background is very important for the estimation
of structural parameters, especially for early-type
galaxies which have extended halos in the outskirts.

• Accounting for the AR spread of local disk galaxies
from Padilla & Strauss (2008) in stacking galaxies
with n ≤ 2.5 , the median eﬀective radius < Re >
of the stacked galaxies is underestimated by 23%
and the mean S´ersic index n is overestimated by
up to 20%. Similarly, the AR spread of local early-
type galaxies from Hao et al. (2006) in stacking

galaxies with n > 2.5 leads to an underestimate of
12% in < Re > and little inﬂuence on the estimate
of n.

• The spread in Re plays a diﬀerent role from that
of the spread in AR, which leads the mean-stacked
proﬁle of galaxies to be more concentrated. Taking
the log-normal distribution of Re from Shen et al.
(2003) into account, < Re > is not biased for ei-
ther early-type or late-type galaxies, and S´ersic in-
dex n is overestimated by 50% for the late-type
galaxies but not signiﬁcantly biased for the early-
type galaxies. When Re scatters within a spread,
the stacked galaxies with a size smaller than the
median contribute more to the central part of the
integrated light, and those with a size larger than
the median contribute more to the extended wing,
resulting in a mean-stacked proﬁle with a higher
S´ersic index and an eﬀective radius equal to the
median of the Re spread.

• The eﬀects of the spreads in AR and Re are linearly
co-added on the estimate of structural parameters
of a stacked image. The actual corrections for these
eﬀects rely on the spread functions.

• Account for the spread of n with a uniform distri-
bution, we ﬁnd that the recovered structural pa-
rameters remain unchanged compared with these
derived with no spread in n counted, suggesting
that the spread of n does not signiﬁcantly eﬀect on
the stacked results.

• In stacking analysis, the galaxies are often classi-
ﬁed by the stellar mass and type, and the AR, Re
and n all have spreads. In this case, we ﬁnd that
the eﬀective radius Re can be underestimated by
20% to 27% for late-type galaxies, and only 10% to
15% for early-type galaxies, due to the AR distri-
bution of galaxies. The S´ersic index n can be well
recovered for early-type galaxies, but can be over-
estimated for late-type galaxies due to both the AR
and Re distribution.

• For faint galaxies, the center we ﬁnd will have an
oﬀset to the real center of galaxies due to the noise.
We also test this eﬀect by stacking galaxies by us-
ing the real center instead of the center found by
Sextractor. We ﬁnd that for galaxies in the range
24 − 24.75 mag, the 68% percentile of the centering
oﬀset is not more than 1 pixel and does not inﬂu-
ence the results.

• Recovery of structural parameters of bulge+disk
galaxies are regulated by the bugle-to-total ratio
B/T , the Re ratio of the two components and the
S´ersic index of the bulge if the disk is exponential
(n = 1). The global S´ersic index nT mainly de-
pends on S´ersic index of the bulge and B/T . The
global eﬀective radius Re,T can be approximately
seen as the light-weighted combination of bulge size
Re,B and disk sizeRe,D. And the ratio Re,B/Re,D
also has inﬂuence on nT at a second-order level.
The AR and Re spreads of the disks and the Re
spread of the bulges lead nT to be increasingly

16

Li et al.

overestimated and Re,T to be increasingly under-
estimated at decreasing B/T .

• By dual-S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting to the stacked pro-
ﬁle of bulge+disk galaxies, the averaged structural
parameters of the bulge and disk components can
be determined although the uncertainties are large.
The AR and Re spreads of disks is the main cause
of the increasing overestimate of B/T (also Re,B)
at decreasing intrinsic B/T . The issue of the bulges
to be pseudo or classical would dramatically change
the results of the dual-S´ersic proﬁle ﬁtting for a
composite proﬁle. We caveat that the measurement
of bulge growth in a statistical sense is signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by the AR and Re spreads of the disks
and S´ersic index of the bulges in the bulge+disk
decomposition through stacking. We thus stress

that interpretation of stacking results should take
these biases into account and the corrections for
the biases are strongly dependent on the structural
parameters of stacked galaxies and the spread func-
tions of them.
