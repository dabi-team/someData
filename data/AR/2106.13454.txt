Introduction

The nuclear landscape has been extended toward the neutron dripline and reached at Ne
isotopes so far [1]. Following the discovery of new neutron-rich isotopes, the evolution of the

nuclear radii in terms of the neutron excess has been of interest as it is closely related to
the properties of “matter” composed of neutron and proton in such extreme neutron/proton

ratio [2–7].

For stable nuclei, the mass number (A) dependence of the nuclear matter radius is roughly
proportional to A1/3 due to the saturation of the nuclear density [8, 9]. For neutron-rich
unstable nuclei, many examples that deviate from this rule have been observed because of
exotic structure properties, e.g., halo structure [10–12] and nuclear deformation [13, 14]. As

it gets closer to the neutron dripline, emergence of deformed halo structure was predicted in
Ne and Mg isotopes [15–20] and was actually observed for 31Ne [21].

Recently, indications of the “core” swelling in neutron-rich Ca isotopes were reported [22,
23] exhibiting a kink of the charge and matter radii at N = 28. In Ref. [24], this phenomenon

was related to the nuclear internal density that the “core” density swells to reduce the internal
density for gaining the total energy. We remark that another mechanism to produce a kink

of the charge radius for heavy nuclei was proposed in Ref. [25]. Since the most of nuclei are
deformed [26], it is natural to extend the study of Ref. [24] for deformed neutron-rich nuclei.

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the radius enhancement mechanism of neutron-
rich unstable nuclei, focusing on the role of the nuclear deformation. We study light- and
medium-mass nuclei with the proton number 8 < Z < 28, where their isotope dependence is

signiﬁcant. It is well known that the nuclear deformation considerably enhances the matter
radius in light-mass neutron-rich isotopes, Ne and Mg [13, 14, 27–31]. We investigate how the

density proﬁles are changed by the nuclear deformation and discuss its correlation with the
internal density. Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations in the three-dimensional Cartesian

coordinate are performed, which allow us to describe any deformed shape. Since the nuclear
deformations predicted are strongly model dependent, several sets of standard Skyrme-type

eﬀective interactions are investigated.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical model employed in
this paper. Model setups of the HF calculation to obtain the deformable ground-state wave

functions is brieﬂy explained. Section 3 is devoted to discuss changes of the density proﬁles
and the enhancement mechanism of the nuclear radius due to nuclear deformation based on

the HF results. We compare these results with spherical constrained HF to clarify the role
of the nuclear deformation. Section 3.1 discusses the evolution of the nuclear deformation as

a function of the neutron number for the neutron-rich isotopes with 8 < Z < 28. Section 3.2

2

illuminates the deformation eﬀect on the density proﬁles. We compare the density distri-
butions obtained with the full and spherical constrained HF calculations for some selected
nuclei, 34Mg, 40S, and 62Cr. The role of nucleon orbits near the Fermi level is quantiﬁed.
Section 3.3 describes more general discussions which relate the nuclear deformation and the

nuclear density in the internal region. Finally, the conclusion is given in Sec. 4.

2 Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation in three-dimensional coordinate space

In this paper, we employ the Skyrme-HF calculation. Since all details can be found in
Refs. [24, 30, 32], we only give a minimum explanation for the present analysis. The ground-

state wave function is expressed as the product of deformable single-particle (s.p.) orbits
represented by the three-dimensional Cartesian mesh which is ﬂexible enough to describe any

nuclear deformation. We obtain these s.p. orbits fully self-consistently in the sphere of radius
20 fm based on the energy density functional of the intrinsic nucleon density ˜ρ [33], E[˜ρ] =
EN + EC − Ecm, where EN is the nuclear energy, EC the Coulomb energy, and Ecm the
center-of-mass energy. The total energy is minimized using the imaginary-time method [34].
The Coulomb interaction is incorporated as given in Ref. [35]. This paper aims to understand

the nuclear deformation eﬀect on the density proﬁle, which is an extension of the previous
study for spherical nuclei [24]. To obtain diﬀerent density proﬁles, four kinds of Skyrme
parameter sets, SkM∗ [36], SLy4 [37], SkI3 [38], and SIII [39] are employed. As a reference
to clarify the role of the nuclear deformation, we also perform the spherical constrained HF

calculation. To preserve the spherical symmetry, the self-consistent HF solution is obtained
with the ﬁlling approximation [39], which assumes a uniform occupation of the Fermi level

with angular momentum j as m/(2j + 1) with m being the number of the outermost nucleons.
We remark that the pairing correlation is an important ingredient for determining of the
nuclear deformation. However, at this stage, the pairing correlation is ignored because it

may induce further model dependence. See, e.g., [26, 40–43].

To guide the degree of the nuclear deformation, the quadrupole deformation parameter

of the ground-state wave function is evaluated, which is deﬁned by

with r2 = x2 + y2 + z2. We take z as the quantization axis and choose it as the largest
(smallest) principal axis for prolate (oblate) deformation. Thus, the sign of β2 follows that

treated as prolate (0 < γ < π/6) or oblate (π/6 < γ < π/3) for simplicity.

3 Results and discussions

3.1 Evolution of nuclear deformation

First we overview the neutron number dependence of even-even neutron-rich isotopes
with 8 < Z < 28. Among the four Skyrme-type interactions employed in this paper, the SkM∗
interaction is superior to describe the nuclear deformation and the validity of these density
distributions for Ne and Mg isotopes were well evaluated as they showed good agreement
with the measured cross sections [30, 44]. The results obtained with the SkM∗ interaction
are mainly discussed unless otherwise mentioned.

Figure 1 plots the quadrupole deformation parameter β2 for those isotopes with (a)
8 < Z < 20 and (b) 20 < Z < 28 as a function of the neutron number. Let us ﬁrst discuss
the isotope dependence of the nuclear deformation for 8 < Z < 20. The reader is refereed to
Ref. [30] for more discussions on the structure of those isotopes with Z = 10–14. Actually, the

nuclear deformation strongly depends on the proton and neutron numbers. The proton and
neutron number of Z, N = 10 and 12 favor a prolately deformed state due to the occupation
of the [nnzml] ˜Ω = [220]1/2 and [211]3/2 orbits, where n, nz, ml, ˜Ω denotes the asymptotic
quantum numbers [46], the principal quantum number, that for the quantization axis z, the

projection of the orbital angular momentum onto z, that of the total angular momentum

4

onto z, respectively. It is well known that Ne and Mg have large deformation in the island of
inversion [14, 47–50]. The most of the Ne and Mg isotopes shows a prolate shape, whereas
24,26Ne are oblately deformed.

To see the calculated results, the proton number of Z = 14 favors both the prolate and

oblate states as the s.p. energy of the [202]5/2 orbit may compete with the prolately deformed
orbits, e.g., [220]1/2 and [211]3/2. Competing with changes in the neutron shell structure by
neutron excess, Si isotopes have relatively small deformations |β2| . 0.2. The proton number
of Z = 16 favors a spherical shape, and thus S isotopes have small β2 values like Si isotopes.
The most of the Ar isotopes (Z = 18) exhibit the oblate deformations. The nucleon number
just before shell closure favors the oblate shape.

Figure 1 (b) draws β2 of Ti, Cr, and Fe isotopes. The most of medium-mass nuclei have the
prolate shape, which is known as the prolate dominance [51–53]. The oblate deformations are
found only in 50−54Ti. 50Ti forms the oblate shape which could be produced in the prolately
deformed state coming from the combination of subshell closed neutron orbit (N = 28) and

prolate-favoring [330]1/2 orbit (Z = 22). Ti, Cr, and Fe isotopes have large deformations at
N ≈ 38, where additional occupancy of the [440]1/2 and [411]3/2 orbits is induced like in
the island of inversion found at N ≈ 20.

distributions are averaged over angles as ρ(r) = 1
dΩ ˜ρ(r, Ω). The density distributions
4π
with the spherical constrained HF are also plotted for comparison. Compared to the spher-
ical one, for 34Mg and 62Cr cases, the deformed state shows more diﬀused nuclear surface
and higher internal density similarly to the case of 30Ne [30], whereas for 40S the internal
density is reduced by the nuclear deformation.

Note that ε(r) with r → ∞ leads to the energy per nucleon E[˜ρ]/A. Figure 3 displays ε(r)
of the full and spherical constrained HF of (a) 34Mg, (b) 40S, and (c) 62Cr. Signiﬁcant con-
tributions of the internal density, say below ≈ 2–3 fm, can clearly be seen in the cumulative
energies. The deformed nuclear states for 34Mg and 62Cr are more advantageous to gain
the energy than the spherical nuclear states, while it is opposite in 40S, where the nuclear
internal density is reduced by the nuclear deformation. It should be noted that the deformed

nuclear states always gain more energy than the spherical one in the surface regions beyond
≈ 3–4 fm. The deformed state is selected in 40S because the energy gain in the surface region
is larger than the energy loss in the internal region compared to the spherical state.

the full and spherical constrained HF calculations. The SkM∗ interaction is employed.

Since the characteristics of occupied s.p. orbit is crucial to determine the nuclear density
distributions, we calculate the occupation probability of the spherical s.p. orbits for these

deformed states. Practically, we simply take overlap between the s.p. orbits of the full and

6

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spherical HF calculations. With this procedure, the components of the spherical s.p. orbits are
projected out from each deformed s.p. orbit. The occupation probabilities for each spherical

s.p. state are obtained by dividing those occupation numbers by the maximum occupation
number 2j + 1 for each s.p. state with the angular momentum j. Figure 4 displays these
obtained occupation probabilities for neutron and proton of (a) 34Mg, (b) 40S, and (c) 62Cr.
The results with the spherical limit is also shown for comparison. The labels of the s.p.
orbits are aligned in order of the s.p. energy. We see that the nuclear deformation only

aﬀects the distribution around the Fermi levels, which makes the surface more diﬀused due
to the mixture of lower orbital-angular-momentum s.p. states, resulting in a further increase

of the nuclear radius compared to the spherical limit. Regarding that these fully occupied
orbitals belong to “core” of the nucleus, the structure change by the nuclear deformation is

governed by the “valence” nucleons.

Fig. 4 Occupation probabilities of the full and spherical constrained HF single-particle
(s.p.) orbits for (a) 34Mg, (b) 40S, and (c) 62Cr. See text for details. The SkM∗ interaction
is employed.

Let us discuss it in more detail. In (a) 34Mg, since the 1s1/2 orbit is located just above
the proton Fermi level 0d5/2, the nuclear deformation induces the occupancy of the 1s1/2
orbit, which leads to the enhancement of the central density as well as the nuclear diﬀuseness

7

 
 
 
as found in Fig. 2 (a). The same phenomenon is also found in the case of N = 14 isotones
[54]. The nuclear deformation induces the occupancy of the 1s1/2 orbit and thus the central
depression of the nuclear density disappears.

In contrast, in the case of (b) 40S, the 1s1/2 orbit is fully occupied in the spherical limit.
To get the state deformed, as the Fermi level for proton is 1s1/2, some of these protons should
be moved to the other orbits around the Fermi level, i.e., the 0d3/2 orbit, resulting in the
reduction of the 1s1/2 occupancy, i.e., the reduction of the central density compared to the
spherical limit displayed in Fig. 2 (b).

For 62Cr, the mechanism is not simple as these for 34Mg and 40S because no vacant
or occupied s orbit near the Fermi level for both proton and neutron. Actually, the nuclear
deformation induces a little increase of the occupancy of the 2s1/2 orbit for neutron. However,
it is not enough to explain the enhancement of the central density presented in Fig. 2 (c).

What induces the enhancement of the central density? To understand this, we compare the
central densities that come from the deepest s.p. orbits [000]1/2 and 0s1/2 obtained by the
deformed and spherical HF calculations, respectively. Since the full HF calculation produces
a deeper mean-ﬁeld potential than the spherical one, the [000]1/2 orbit is conﬁned in a
narrower potential well than that of the spherical 0s1/2 orbit. In fact, the respective s.p.
energies are −44.41 and −43.29 MeV. The resulting central density of the [000]1/2 orbit for
neutron becomes approximately 10% higher than the spherical 0s1/2 orbit, which corresponds
to about half of the total enhancement of the central density. This enhancement of the central
density for proton is tiny ≈ 1%. The other contribution may come from the change in the
1s1/2 orbit by the deformation, which is not easily identiﬁed as it is constructed from various
deformed s.p. orbits.

We note that the pairing correlations also give the fractional occupation probabilities

for the states around Fermi level. Incorporating the pairing interaction is necessary for
more qualitative discussions that involve close comparison with experimental data, see, e.g.,

Ref. [45] for Cr isotopes; however, it is beyond the scope of this paper.

3.3 Correlations of the nuclear deformation and internal density

In the previous subsection, we showed the energy contributions of the internal and surface

density, which can be the trigger for the nuclear deformation. Extending the discussion for
more general cases, we evaluate the correlations between the nuclear deformation and the

internal density. Here we take the central density ρ(0) = ˜ρ(0) as a degree of the internal
density for all isotopes adopted in this paper.

Figure 5 (a) displays a correlation plot of the relative diﬀerence of the central den-

sities calculated by the full and spherical constrained HF calculations: ∆[ρ(0)] = [ρ(0) −

interactions are employed.

ρsph.(0)]/ρsph.(0), with the SkM* interaction. We ﬁnd that the |∆[ρ(0)]| value becomes large
for largely deformed states. This indicates that the nuclear deformation can be driven by

those changes of the internal density. The most of isotopes are deformed by ﬁlling the internal
densities, while the most of S, and Ar isotopes lower their internal densities by the nuclear

deformation. The most striking diﬀerence of these isotopes among the others are that the
central densities are quite high ≈ 0.18–0.19 fm−3 in the spherical limit because the 1s1/2
orbits are fully occupied like in the case of 40S [Fig. 2 (b)].

We make the same analysis with the other Skyrme interactions, the SLy4, SkI3, and SIII
interactions. The results are respectively displayed in Figs. 5 (b), (c) and (d). Though there

are some quantitative diﬀerences, the similar trend is obtained for diﬀerent Skyrme interac-
tions. The larger |∆[ρ(0)]|, the larger |β2| becomes. The functional form of |∆[ρ(0)]| appears
to be a quadratic function of β2. To quantify this correlation, we calculate the correlation

9

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
coeﬃcient of β2
2 and |∆[ρ(0)]| for each interaction. In fact, they show correlations as the
calculated correlation coeﬃcients are 0.77, 0.73, 0.66, and 0.54 for the SkM∗, SLy4, SkI3,
and SIII interactions, respectively. This square proportionality can roughly be explained
within an assumption of volume conservation with a sharp radius R. Using the familiar
radius formula R′ = R
2 [9] for quadrupole deformed surface for small β2, we
get ∆[ρ(0)] ≈ − 15
2 . Though the estimation always predicts a negative value for ∆[ρ(0)], it
gives ∆[ρ(0)] ≈ −0.01–−0.05 for |β2| = 0.1–0.3, which is reasonable. In reality, the most of
the cases show a positive ∆[ρ(0)] value owing to the modiﬁcation of the surface distributions
demonstrated in Figs. 2 (a) and (c). This rough estimation can only be applied to the cases
that exhibit relatively small change of the surface density distributions, e.g., 40S in Fig. 2
(b).

Comparing the results with diﬀerent Skyrme interactions, the behavior of ∆[ρ(0)] with
the SkM∗ and SLy4 interactions is similar; the largest ∆[ρ(0)] values are shown with the
SkI3 interaction; and the SIII interaction tends to give smaller values and the correlation

becomes small. This fact may be related to the nuclear equation of state (EOS) parameters,
which characterize the softness of the nuclear matter against nucleon excess. Some relevant

values for each interaction are listed in Table 1. Those listed EOS parameters are similar for
the SkM∗ and SLy4 interactions. The SkI3 interaction has very large slope parameter of the
symmetry energy L, while the incompressibility K0 and the symmetry energy Esym are not
much diﬀerent from these for the SkM∗ and SLy4 interactions. Since the energy loss against
the neutron- and proton-number asymmetry from the nuclear saturation density, i.e., 0.16
fm−3 for N = Z, is largest for the SkI3 interaction, larger central density fraction ∆[ρ(0)] is
needed to induce large nuclear deformation compared to the other interactions. In contrast,
the SIII interaction gives extremely small L and large K0. As displayed in Fig. 5, the ∆[ρ(0)]
values are hard to change compared to the other interactions.

Fig. 6 Rms matter radii of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni isotopes as a
function of the neutron number. The open symbols denote the matter radii obtained with the

spherical constraint HF calculations. The results of O, Ca, Ni are taken from Ref. [24]. For
the sake of visibility, (Z − 8) × 0.1 fm is added to the results. Two-headed arrows indicate
the regions where the core swelling is expected to occur. See text for more details. The SkM∗
interaction is employed.

How does the nuclear deformation aﬀect the nuclear radius? Figure 6 displays the root-
mean-square (rms) matter radii rm of those isotopes with Z = 8–28 calculated with the full
(closed symbols) and the spherical constrained HF (open symbols) calculations. Note that we
omit the results with the spherical HF calculations for 32,34Ne because they are not bound.

11

 
A kink of the nuclear radius across N = 18–20 for Ne and Mg isotopes appears when the
nuclear state exhibits large quadrupole deformation. The enhancement of the Ne isotopes

near the dripline N = 20–24 is exception that can be recognized as the systems have weakly
bound orbit . 3 MeV. They are consistent with the ﬁndings of the systematic analyses given
in Refs. [27–31, 44].

We note that in the spherical constrained HF calculation despite that all the nuclear

states are spherical, the matter radii already show some kinks at the magic and semi-magic
numbers, i.e., N = 14, 20, and 28. This can be explained by the core swelling mechanism that

recently proposed in Ref. [24]. The enhancement of the nuclear radii occurs when the valence
neutrons ﬁll the nodal or j-lower orbits, resulting in the core swelling or the enhancement

of the nuclear radius to avoid the high density in the internal regions. For the sake of
comparison, the results of the O, Ca, and Ni isotopes taken from Ref. [24] are shown. Their

neutron number dependence is similar to those of the spherical constrained HF calculations
from Ne to Fe isotopes studied in this paper: The sudden enhancement of the nuclear radius
occurs in the spherical constrained HF calculations for N = 14–20 when 1s1/2, 0d3/2 are
occupied, and for N = 28–40 when 1p3/2, 0f5/2, and 1p1/2 are occupied.

We see that the deformed HF results always gives larger radius than the spherical one for
all the isotopes employed in this paper. It is natural to presume that the radius enhancement

occurs by following the core swelling mechanism [24] and the radius is further enhanced when
the nucleus exhibits the nuclear deformation.

4 Conclusions

In order to elucidate the enhancement mechanism of the nuclear radius, we have studied

the eﬀect of the nuclear deformation on the nuclear density proﬁles. A systematic investi-
gation for even-even light- and medium-mass neutron-rich nuclei of 8 < Z < 28 has been

made based on the ground-state density distributions obtained from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
calculations in a three-dimensional Cartesian mesh. A spherical constrained HF calculation

has also been performed as a reference state of each deformed HF state.

The nuclear internal density can be a key to understanding the deformation phenomena.

We have shown that the nuclear deformation is determined by minimizing the total energy in
the whole nuclear regions, not only in the surface region but also in the internal region. We

ﬁnd correlations between the changes in the internal density and the nuclear deformation,
which can be related to the properties of nuclear matter. A deformed nuclear state is selected

to weigh the relative energy gains in the internal and surface regions. In general, the nuclear

12

deformation induces more diﬀused nuclear surface while changing the magnitude of the den-
sity distributions in the internal regions. From a microscopic point of view, this phenomenon

can be explained by considering the fact that the nuclear deformation mainly inﬂuences the
occupation of the spherical single-particle orbits near the Fermi level. Changes of the nuclear

density in the internal regions become signiﬁcant when the occupied or unoccupied s orbital
is located near the Fermi level because its occupation number is strongly modiﬁed by the
nuclear deformation.

We have found that in the spherical limit the evolution of the nuclear radius with respect
to the neutron number follows the core swelling rule proposed in Ref. [24] that a “core”

nucleus swells when the single-particle orbits that have large spatial overlap between the
orbitals in the core. The core swelling is responsible for developing the nuclear bulk and the
nuclear deformation plays a role to diﬀuse the density proﬁle at the surface regions resulting

in a further increase of the nuclear radius. The nuclear deformation mainly changes the
occupation number near the Fermi level, while the occupation numbers of the deeper bound

orbitals are not changed even the single-particle states are deformed. This is a strong basis
that the core swelling phenomena found in the spherical nuclei [23, 24] is universal for the

radius enhancement, although the occupation number of the single-particle orbits near the
Fermi level becomes fractional by the surface phenomena such as nuclear deformation.

In this paper, we have discussed the possible correlations between the nuclear deformation

and internal density. We note, however, this work only includes the deformation eﬀect to the
density proﬁle with a standard mean-ﬁeld approximation. To establish the ﬁnding of this

work, a careful investigation is necessary that includes the pairing correlation and various
many-body eﬀects beyond the mean-ﬁeld level. Also, experimental studies to extract the

internal density of unstable nuclei are desired such as electron scattering which was recently
realized [55].
