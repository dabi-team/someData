ABSTRACT

Magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs) are believed to be the core structure in solar eruptions, nevertheless,
their formation remains intensely debated. Here we report a rapid buildup process of an MFR-system
during a conﬁned X2.2 class ﬂare occurred on 2017 September 6 in NOAA AR 12673, three hours
after which the structure erupted to a major coronal mass ejection (CME) accompanied by an X9.3
class ﬂare. For the X2.2 ﬂare, we do not ﬁnd EUV dimmings, separation of its ﬂare ribbons, or clear
CME signatures, suggesting a conﬁned ﬂare. For the X9.3 ﬂare, large-scale dimmings, separation of
its ﬂare ribbons, and a CME show it to be eruptive. By performing a time sequence of nonlinear
force-free ﬁelds (NLFFFs) extrapolations we ﬁnd that: until the eruptive ﬂare, an MFR-system was
located in the AR. During the conﬁned ﬂare, the axial ﬂux and the lower bound of the magnetic helicity
for the MFR-system were dramatically enhanced by about 86% and 260%, respectively, although the
mean twist number was almost unchanged. During the eruptive ﬂare, the three parameters were all
signiﬁcantly reduced. The results evidence the buildup and release of the MFR-system during the
conﬁned and the eruptive ﬂare, respectively. The former may be achieved by ﬂare reconnection. We
also calculate the pre-ﬂare distributions of the decay index above the main polarity inversion line (PIL)
and ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. It indicates that the buildup of the magnetic ﬂux and helicity of the
MFR-system may play a role in facilitating its ﬁnal eruption.

1. INTRODUCTION

Magnetic ﬂux ropes, consisting of twisted ﬁeld lines
winding around the main axis, are fundamental struc-
tures on the sun. It’s generally accepted that the main
drivers of hazardous space weather - CMEs - are ex-
pulsions of MFRs (e.g., Amari et al. 2000, Cheng et al.
2017). Therefore, their properties, e.g., formation, evo-
lution, stability, are long-standing topics. In most so-
lar eruption models, the MFRs play key roles.
In
some ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models, pre-
existing MFRs are required: once the background mag-
netic ﬁelds decrease fast enough (torus instability, Kliem
& T¨or¨ok 2006), or the rope’s twist number reaches a
critical value (kink instability, T¨or¨ok et al. 2004), the

can be formed during the eruption: magnetic reconnec-
tion happens below (tether-cutting model, Moore et al.
2001) or above (breakout model, Antiochos et al. 1999)
the sheared magnetic arcades, then forms the MFR and
initiates the eruption. In either kind of models, the erup-
tion entity is the MFR.

Despite its pre-existence for an eruption, the MFR is
proposed to be formed or strengthened mainly through
two ways: one is its bodily emergence, supported by
simulations (e.g., Fan 2001, Leake et al. 2013) and ob-
servations (e.g., Okamoto et al. 2008), though ques-
tioned by some work (Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2012);
the other is reconnection mechanism, in which the MFR
is formed/strengthened through the reconnection (e.g.,
Cheng et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2017),
sometimes manifested as ﬂux cancellation (e.g., Green
et al. 2011). The twist numbers of interplanetary MFRs
are usually larger than that of pre-eruption MFRs, sug-
gesting that the latter may be strengthened by reconnec-
tion during the eruptions (Wang et al. 2016). Besides,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

photospheric ﬂows/motions, e.g., shear/converging mo-
tions, sunspot rotations are reported to build up the
MFRs eﬀectively (e.g., Fan 2009, Yan et al. 2018).

In the reconnection formation scenario, the MFRs can
even be formed during conﬁned ﬂares before success-
ful eruptions as reported: Patsourakos et al. (2013) ob-
served a limb event, showing the formation of an MFR
during a conﬁned C4.5 GOES class ﬂare before its ejec-
tion in the subsequent M7.7 ﬂare; Guo et al. (2013) sug-
gested that an MFR can be built-up during a series of
conﬁned ﬂares before a CME and a major ﬂare; Chint-
zoglou et al. (2015) reported formation and strengthen-
ing of two MFRs during conﬁned ﬂares before two suc-
cessive CMEs; James et al. (2018) also reported an MFR
formation in a conﬁned ﬂare before its ﬁnal eruption.

Nevertheless, the formation/buildup of MFRs during
as intense as X-class ﬂares is barely reported to our best
knowledge. Here we present a buildup process of an
MFR-system during a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare (SOL2017-09-
06T08:57) that occurred in NOAA active region (AR)
12673, which erupted to a major CME accompanied
by an X9.3 ﬂare (SOL2017-09-06T11:53) three hours
later. We mainly focus on analyzing the properties of
the source coronal magnetic ﬁelds (CMFs) based on a
time-sequence of NLFFF extrapolations.

2. DATA AND METHODS

Both analyzed ﬂares occurred near S09W33. Their
on-disk evolution is captured by SDO/AIA (Pesnell
et al. 2012). The associated coronal outﬂows are ob-
served by SOHO/LASCO (Domingo et al. 1995). The
photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds are recorded by
SDO/HMI. Here a magnetic-ﬁeld data product called
SHARP (Bobra et al. 2014) is used. The three dimen-
sional CMFs are reconstructed by an NLFFF extrapola-
tion model (Wiegelmann 2004, Wiegelmann et al. 2012)
and a potential ﬁelds (PFs) model (e.g., Sakurai 1989),
using SHARP magnetograms as the bottom boundaries.
Based on the reconstructed CMFs, we may identify
the MFR by combining the twist number Tw and squash-
ing factor Q (Liu et al. 2016). Tw measures the num-
ber of turns of a ﬁeld line winding, and is calculated

by Tw =

αdl. α, l and dl denote the force-free pa-

rameter, the ﬁeld line length, and the elementary length,
respectively. Q measures the change of the connectivity
of the ﬁeld lines. High Q values indicate the positions
of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) where the connectiv-
ity changes dramatically (e.g., D´emoulin et al. 1996).
For an MFR, its twisted ﬁelds lines are distinct from
the surrounding ﬁelds, thus are wrapped by QSL. Its
cross section displays a twisted region enclosed by high
Q lines.

Once the MFR is located, its toroidal (i.e., axial) ﬂux
can be calculated by Φt = B · S, where S = Sn, S and
n denote the area and normal unit vector of its cross
section. The ﬂux-weighted mean twist number can be

Σ|TwBn|dA
Σ|Bn|dA

computed by < |Tw| >=

, where dA is the

elementary area.
Its magnetic helicity can be simply
estimated by a twist number method (Priest & Forbes
2000, Guo et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2016, Guo et al. 2017)
using Htwist ≈ TwΦ2. Magnetic helicity measures the
geometrical complexity of the magnetic ﬁelds. For a
single MFR, the aforementioned method is applicable
when its writhe can be omitted, giving the lower bound
of its helicity.

Additionally, the decay index measuring the decrease
of the external PFs with height can be calculated by

∂ ln Bex(h)
∂ ln h

n = −
. Bex is the traverse component of PFs
and h is the height. As stated in torus instability theory,
the background PFs play the major role in conﬁning
the eruption. Once the MFR reaches a region where n
is beyond a threshold, the torus instability will occur.
The threshold value varies depending on the properties
of the MFR (e.g., D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010, Olmedo
& Zhang 2010). We use 1.5 (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006) as a
representative value here.

3. OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS

3.1. Eruptiveness of the Flares

NOAA AR 12673 exhibited the fastest magnetic ﬂux
emergence ever observed at its early stage (Sun & Nor-
ton 2017), and had been relatively well-developed when
producing the two ﬂares (Figure 1a). The source of
both ﬂares involved the central main polarities (N1 and
P1) and the northern negative polarity (N2). Before
both ﬂares, hot channels (HCs), which refer to the S-
shaped structures appearing above the PILs in high-
temperature AIA passbands (94 and 131 ˚A) and con-
sidered as the proxies of MFRs (e.g., Zhang et al. 2012),
were visible in 94 ˚A (Figure 1c1 and d1). Although
the one before the ﬁrst ﬂare was slightly diﬀuse, the
HCs indicated the existence of MFRs. During the ﬁrst
ﬂare, brightenings occurred along the HC, after which an
HC was still found (Figure 1c2–c5). During the second
ﬂare, the eruption of the HC was observed; post-ﬂare
loops appeared later (Figure 1d2–d5). The observa-
tions hint that the ﬁrst (second) ﬂare may be conﬁned
(eruptive).

In both ﬂares, three ribbons (r1, r2 and r3 in Fig-
ure 2) appeared in 1600 ˚A passband. For the ﬁrst ﬂare,
the two main ribbons (r1 and r2) did not separate as
a function of time (Figure 2b), which is in contrast
to that of an eruptive ﬂare as stated in standard ﬂare

model (e.g., Carmichael 1964), also indicating a con-
ﬁned ﬂare. No large-scale dimmings were observed in
211 ˚A (Figure 2c). Careful inspection of the observa-
tions in 304 ˚A neither ﬁnds ejection signs. The associ-
ated faint and narrow coronal outﬂow (Figure 2d) might
not be enough to be deﬁned as a CME. For the sec-
ond ﬂare, Figure 2f clearly shows that the ribbons sep-
arated as the ﬂare evolved. Clear dimmings were seen
in 211 ˚A passband after the ﬂare (Figure 2g), indicating
mass depletion. The appeared bright, halo CME (Fig-
ure 2h) further conﬁrmed the second ﬂare being erup-
tive.

We calculate Tw and Q in multiple vertical planes
across the main PIL to trace the possible MFR before
and after the ﬂares (see details in Section 3.2). The se-
lected ﬁeld lines tracing through twisted/highly sheared
regions enclosed by high Q lines are shown in Figure 3.
Before the conﬁned ﬂare, an MFR-like structure com-
posed of diﬀerent branches of ﬁeld lines was located
(Figure 3a). Two branches connected N1 and P1 (cyan
and green lines), having distinguishable boundaries in
the Tw and Q maps (see Section 3.2). One branch (ma-
genta lines) connected P1 and N2. The footpoints of the
ﬁeld lines corresponded to the positions of the ﬂare rib-
bons. Note that, a mature MFR requires its ﬁeld lines
having a coherent structure, which wasn’t perfectly met
here. However, the branches were located close, evolved
as a whole and erupted together ﬁnally (see contents
below). Thus, we name the structure an MFR-system.
After the conﬁned ﬂare, an MFR-system was also found
(Figure 3b), although its conﬁguration was signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the one before the ﬂare. It was still com-
posed of diﬀerent branches, with one branch connecting
N1 and P1 (cyan lines), two branches connecting P1 and
N2 with opposite handedness (magenta and brown lines
in Figure 3b, see section 3.2). The survival of the MFR-
system was consistent with the absence of a CME.

Before the eruptive ﬂare, an MFR-system was still
located (Figure 3c), though its topology had a slight
change, appearing longer ﬁeld lines (shown in yellow).
The footpoints of these ﬁeld lines were consistent with
the positions of the ﬂare ribbons. After the ﬂare, the
MFR-system disappeared, only a sheared structure sur-
vived (Figure 3d).

In summary, for the X2.2 ﬂare, no clear EUV dim-
mings or separation of its ﬂare ribbons were observed;
the accompanied coronal outﬂow was faint and narrow,
indicating a conﬁned ﬂare. For the X9.3 ﬂare, clear on-
disk eruption signs, EUV dimmings, separation of its
ﬂare ribbons, and the accompanied major CME indi-
cated an eruptive ﬂare. The survival and disappearance

3

of the MFR-system after respective ﬂare were consistent
with their eruptiveness.

3.2. Buildup of the MFR-system during the Conﬁned

Flare

3.2.1. Boundary of the MFR-system

To quantitatively study the properties of the MFR-
system, we select eight instances (vertical-dashed lines
in Figure 1b), at which Tw and Q distributions in a
vertical plane are displayed (Figure 4). We choose the
plane because it intersected all rope branches. The com-
putational grid of the plane is reﬁned by 16 times for a
higher precision (following Liu et al. 2016). To addi-
tionally calculate Φt, < |Tw| >, and Htwist of the MFR-
system, its boundary needs to be determined. Owing to
that perfectly closed QSLs enclosing the MFR-system
cannot be found here, the boundaries (white dotted-
lines in Figure 4) are determined manually through
combining the high-Q lines and contours of the thresh-
olds of |Tw|. The thresholds are decided when the
high Q and contour lines connect smoothly, resulting
in a value of 1.1 before the eruptive ﬂare (1-6 in Fig-
ure 4), and 0.7 after the eruptive ﬂare (7-8 in Fig-
ure 4). The parameters calculated in the cross sections
are shown in Figure 5. The fractional changes of Φt and

Htwist are calculated by RΦ =

RH =

Htwist(i) − Htwist(i − 1)
Htwist(i − 1)

the ith instance.

Φt(i) − Φt(i − 1)
Φt(i − 1)

and

, respectively, i means

Uncertainty for each parameter is considered from two
sources: the selection of the plane and the determina-
tion of the MFR-system boundaries. For the former, we
choose another two planes that also intersected all rope
branches and repeat the calculation, then regard the
standard deviation of the values from the three planes
as part of the upper/lower error shown in Figure 5. For
the later, we apply the morphological erosion and dila-
tion, with a circular kernel (r ≈ 0.1 Mm), to the regions
in the determined boundaries, resulting in a shrunken
and a distend regions where we calculate the parameter
again; the diﬀerence between the values from the origi-
nal and the distend (shrunken) regions is regarded as the
other part of the upper (lower) error. The ﬁnal errors
shown in Figure 5 are the sum of the two parts.

3.2.2. Evolution of the Properties of the MFR-system

At the two instances (1 and 2 in Figure 4) before
the conﬁned ﬂare, Tw and Q maps showed no signiﬁcant
change. Three twisted regions (× symbols in Figure 4a2,
4b2) with distinguishable Q boundaries were located,
conﬁrming the existence of an MFR-system with dif-
ferent branches, as shown in Figure 3a. After the ﬁrst

4

ﬂare, twisted regions with high Q boundaries can still be
found (3 in Figure 4), consistent with the MFR-system
shown in Figure 3b. The right part of the twisted re-
gions showed a ﬁeld lines set with left handedness (neg-
ative twist) overlain by another set with right handed-
ness (positive twist), displaying a complex conﬁguration.
The cross section of the structure displayed an apparent
expansion. Its equivalent radius increased from 1.6 Mm
to 2.6 Mm, indicating a possible enhancement of the ax-
ial ﬂux. Meanwhile, its estimated length (∼100 Mm)
and height (below 10 Mm) didn’t change signiﬁcantly.

At the instances between the two ﬂares (4, 5 and 6 in
Figure 4), twisted regions with high Q lines were all lo-
cated, although with their patterns slightly changing, in-
dicating that the MFR-system was evolving slowly. Af-
ter the eruptive ﬂare (7 in Figure 4), the twisted region
disappeared, left a strongly sheared region (with aver-
age |Tw| around 0.8 turns), consistent with the eruption
of the observed HC. One hour later, a sheared structure
was still located, having lower Tw (∼ 0.6) and smaller
cross section (8 in Figure 4).

The temporal evolution of Φt (Figure 5a) showed that
it experienced a dramatic increase after the conﬁned
ﬂare from 1.63 × 1020 Mx to 3.04 × 1020 Mx (by 86%),
then increased slowly to 3.96 × 1020 Mx at 11:34 UT,
and ﬁnally reduced to 0.56 × 1020 Mx after the erup-
tive ﬂare.
In the mean time, < |Tw| > kept a value
around 1.3 and dropped to 0.8 before and after the erup-
tive ﬂare, respectively (Figure 5b). Htwist also dramat-
ically increased from 3.7 × 1040 Mx2 to 13.1 × 1040 Mx2
(by 260%) after the conﬁned ﬂare, then slowly evolved
to 21.1 × 1040 Mx2 at 11:34 UT, and decreased to
0.2 × 1040 Mx2 after the eruptive ﬂare (Figure 5c).
Moreover, as the decay index distributions in Figure 5d
showed, before both ﬂares, n reached the critical height
(where n = 1.5) around 30 Mm, showing no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence when considering the computing errors.

The magnetic ﬂux and helicity of the entire AR were
also estimated. The former was on the order of ∼
1022 Mx. The latter was an accumulated value since the
emergence of the AR, and was roughly assessed based on
a velocity estimation method called DAVE4VM (Schuck
2008); its value was on the order of ∼ 1043 Mx2. The
two parameters of the MFR-system only accounted for
∼ 1% of the values of the AR.

In summary, we calculate Tw and Q in the cross sec-
tion of the MFR-system at eight instances, and analyze
the evolution of its Φt, < |Tw| >, and Htwist. During
the conﬁned ﬂare, the twist number had no signiﬁcant
change; interestingly, its axial ﬂux and magnetic helic-
ity were enhanced dramatically. After the eruptive ﬂare,
the parameters were all signiﬁcantly reduced. The re-

sults indicate a rapid buildup and a release process of
the MFR-system during the conﬁned and eruptive ﬂare,
respectively. The similar pre-ﬂare distributions of the
decay index further suggest that the change of the MFR-
system itself may play a more signiﬁcant role in its ﬁnal
eruption here.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

Here we present a buildup process of an MFR-system
during a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare occurred on 2017 September
6 in NOAA AR 12673, which was evidenced by signiﬁ-
cant enhancement of its axial ﬂux and magnetic helicity.
The MFR-system erupted to a major CME during the
following X9.3 ﬂare three hours later.

Note that, the coronal outﬂow associated with the ﬁrst
ﬂare is classiﬁed as a CME in some work (e.g., Yan
et al. 2018). However, it was very faint, narrow, and
did not propagate further than 10 R(cid:12), being clearly dif-
ferent from the major CME associated with the second
ﬂare. This kind of outﬂows, showing no clear shape
of MFRs, failing to propagate to a large distance that
seem not to be related to MFRs, are deﬁned as “pseudo-
” CMEs (Vourlidas et al. 2010, 2013). The outﬂow
here should not be relevant to the MFR-system we dis-
cussed. Combined with the evidence in Section 3.1, we
argue that the X2.2 ﬂare was conﬁned. Verma (2018)
also found localized, conﬁned ﬂare kernels in white-light
emission of the X2.2 ﬂare and separating ribbons in that
of the X9.3 ﬂare, consistent with our arguments.

The structure composed of multiple ﬁeld lines
branches here was deﬁned as an MFR-system. Note
that, we cannot exclude the possibility that those
branches were diﬀerent MFRs due to the distinguish-
able boundaries they had, and the opposite helicity signs
that diﬀerent branches further displayed after the ﬁrst
ﬂare. However, the branches were located close; more
importantly, they evolved and erupted together, indi-
cating that deﬁning the structure as an MFR-system
should be reasonable. The QSL of the MFR-system was
not perfectly closed, indicating a possible bald patch
topology (e.g., Savcheva et al. 2012), and/or ongoing
development. The evolution of Q and Tw patterns sup-
ported its development. When no eruption occurred,
the slow evolution of the MFR-system may be driven
by sunspot rotation and shear motion (Yan et al. 2018).
The multiple-branch conﬁguration of an MFR-system
has been reported (e.g., Inoue et al. 2016, or double-
decker MFR in e.g., Cheng et al. 2014), and is thought
to play a role in an eruption when interaction exists
between diﬀerent branches (Awasthi et al. 2018).

Besides the ﬁnal eruption, the most dramatic change
of the MFR-system happened during the conﬁned ﬂare.

5

Its axial ﬂux and magnetic helicity increased by 86%
and 260% within tens of minutes, clearly evidencing
a rapid buildup of the MFR-system. The process can
be achieved by the fast ﬂare reconnection, which can
add ﬂux to a pre-existing MFR eﬃciently. Here the
reconnection may start at the QSL between diﬀerent
branches, involving not only the rope ﬁelds but also the
surrounding ﬁelds, adding more ﬂux to the rope. Cor-
respondence between the footpoints of the MFR-system
and the ﬂare ribbons also supported such a scenario.
The mean twist number did not signiﬁcantly change
during the conﬁned ﬂare, indicating that the toroidal
and poloidal ﬂux were added to the MFR-system with
equal proportion, keeping the twist number relatively
invariant. Meanwhile, the decay index distributions
showed no signiﬁcant evolution. The result was in agree-
ment with Nindos et al. (2012), in which small temporal
evolution of the decay index, accompanied by helicity
buildup, was found during a multi-day period when var-
ious eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂares occurred.

The increase of the MFR-system ﬂux may lead to a
easier catastrophe (e.g., Zhang et al. 2016). The en-
hanced magnetic helicity of the MFR-system is related
to the helicity of the current-carrying magnetic ﬁelds,
the ratio of which to the total helicity is positively cor-
related to the CME eruptivity of a region (Pariat et al.
2017). Based on the fact of nearly invariant decay in-
dex, we conjecture that the ﬁrst conﬁned ﬂare enhanced
the MFR-system so that facilitated the next successful
eruption. The result is also consistent with a so-called
“domino-eﬀect” scenario (Zuccarello et al. 2009), which
emphasizes the inﬂuence from the previous activity. One
should pay more attention to the close precursors of the
eruptions (Wang et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2017), since they
might play roles in facilitating the ﬁnal eruptions.
