1. Introduction

In the zero-forcing process on a graph G, we select a subset of vertices and color them black. These
vertices are said to be infected. At discrete time steps, if an infected vertex has one uninfected neighbor,
that neighbor becomes infected, e.g. u infects v if N[u] \ Z = {v}, where Z is the set of infected vertices.
The minimum number of vertices needed to infect the entire graph is called the zero-forcing number of G,
denoted Z(G). Recently, zero-forcing has been used to study multiplicities of eigenvalues of graphs [15]
and the minimum rank and maximum nullity of graphs [1, 12, 13, 17]. Additionally, it has been shown to
be closely related to power domination [3, 4].

A vertex v of a graph G totally dominates another vertex u if they are neighbors, i.e. if uv ∈ E. N(v) is
the open neighborhood of v, which is the set of neighbors of v and N[v] is the closed neighborhood of v,
N[v] = N(v) ∪ v. Let S = (v1, . . . , vk) be a sequence of vertices such that N[vi] \ ∪i−1
j=1N[vj] 6= ∅ for each
b
S. For a graph G, the length of the longest sequence
i ∈ [k], and denote the unordered elements of S as
S of vertices of G is known as the Grundy domination number, denoted by γgr(G). In other words, S is
the longest sequence such that each vertex in the sequence dominates a new vertex of G. For any vertex
v ∈ S, v footprints any u ∈ N[vi] \ ∪i−1
j=1N[vj]. The index, or location, of a vertex v in the sequence S is
written as i(v).

Grundy domination was introduced in [9] and it was later shown that the zero-forcing number is related
to the Grundy domination number [5]. In the following years, the related concepts of total Grundy dom-
ination (t-Grundy), Z-Grundy domination, and L-Grundy domination have been introduced and studied
extensively [2, 5–10, 14, 16].

In this paper, we will provide results on L-Grundy domination that mirror previous results in t-Grundy
domination. For a graph G, a sequence of vertices S is an L-Grundy sequence if N[vi]\∪i−1
j=1N(vj) 6= ∅. The
L-Grundy dominating number of a graph G, denoted by γL
gr(G), is the longest length L-Grundy sequence.
A sequence of vertices S ⊂ V (G) is a t-Grundy sequence if N(vi)\∪i−1
j=1N(vj) 6= ∅. The length of the longest
t-Grundy sequence for a graph G is the t-Grundy domination number, denoted γt
gr(G). A vertex in an
L-sequence (t-sequence) is said to L-footprint (t-footprint) another vertex if it mirrors the above footprint
deﬁnition with the appropriate open and closed neighborhoods. When there is no chance of confusion, we
will drop the modiﬁer and only use footprint. Obtaining bounds for the t-Grundy domination number of
a graph G from its minimum and maximum degree was studied in [10]. In particular, they showed that if

the minimum degree of a graph G is δ, then γt
conjectured that the same bound holds in [7]. Speciﬁcally,

gr(G) ≤ n − δ + 1. For the L-Grundy number of G, it was

Conjecture 1.1 ([7]). If G on n vertices with minimum degree δ, then γL

gr(G) ≤ n − δ + 1.

In Section 2, we prove the conjecture true.

In [10] it was shown that graphs G satisfying γt
gr(G) = 2 are complete multipartite and that no graph has
t-Grundy number 3. It was also shown that all graphs G satisfying γt
gr(G) = |V (G)| have very speciﬁc
structure. In Section 3, we prove an analogous characterization of graphs with L-Grundy number equal to
two and present early results towards the classiﬁcation of graphs G satisfying γL

gr(G) = |V (G)|.

The eﬀects of edge or vertex removal on the Grundy and t-Grundy number was studied in [8, 11]. We
provide analogous results for edge and vertex removal for the L-Grundy number in Section 4 and conclude
the paper with open problems in Section 5.

2. Proof of Conjecture 1.1

For the t-Grundy dominating number of a graph G with minimum degree δ, Brešar, Henning, and Rall
showed that γt
gr(G) ≤ n − δ + 1 [10]. Clearly, since any dominating number of a graph G can be at most
the number of vertices, γt
gr(G) ≤ n. However, despite not proving that
the same inequality holds in the L-Grundy regime, Brešar, Gologranc, Henning, and Kos [7] proved that if
G is an n-vertex graph satisfying γL
gr(G) = n, then there exists a vertex u such that deg(u) ≤ 1. We now
prove that Conjecture 1.1 is true.

gr(G) ≤ n, it follows that if δ = 1, γt

Theorem 2.1. If G is a graph on n vertices with minimum degree δ, then γL

gr(G) ≤ n − δ + 1.

Proof. Let G be an n-vertex graph with minimum degree δ. Since every graph has an L-Grundy set at
most the size of the vertex set, if δ = 1 then γL
gr(G) = n
must have a vertex of degree 1. Therefore, if δ = 2, then γL
gr(G) ≤ n − 1. For the remainder of the proof,
assume that δ ≥ 3.

gr(G) ≤ n. Furthermore, any graph G satisfying γL

3. L-Grundy Domination Numbers of Graphs With a View Towards Characterization

3.1. Graphs with small L-Grundy numbers and results for cliques.
Related to the problem of characterizing graphs with L-Grundy number equal to the number of vertices
is characterizing graphs with small L-Grundy numbers. Interestingly, it was shown in [11] that there is
no graph G such that γt
gr(G) = 3. In the L-Grundy regime however, that is untrue since a path on three
vertices, P3, proves otherwise. Moreover, P3 is not the only graph with L-Grundy number equal to 3 (delete
an edge from a K4). Additionally, it was shown in [10] that a graph has t-Grundy number 2 if and only
if it is a complete multipartite graph. We prove that if G is a connected graph, γL
gr(G) = 2 if and only if
G = Kn.

Lemma 3.1. If G is a connected graph on n vertices and γL
adjacent.

gr(G) = 2, then the vertices in the L-set are

Proof. Let G be an n-vertex graph, γL
gr(G) = 2, and S = (x, y) be an L-sequence of length two. Suppose
by contradiction that x and y are not adjacent. If G has only two vertices, this contradicts the fact that

G is connected. Thus, suppose G has at least three vertices. Since G is connected, this implies there is

at least one v that is a neighbor of either x, y, or both. Then, (x, y, v) is a L-sequence of length three, a

contradiction.

Thus, the two vertices of the L-sequence are adjacent.

(cid:3)

With this lemma, we can now characterize graphs that have L-Grundy dominating number equal to
two.

Theorem 3.2. If G is a connected graph on n ≥ 3 vertices, then γL

gr(G) = 2 if and only if G = Kn.

Proof. Since γL
gr(G) = 2, the two vertices in the L-sequence, x and y, are adjacent to each other. Any
vertex v ∈ V (G) is adjacent to both x and y, else (v, y, x) or (v, x, y) is a longer L-sequence. Thus, the K3
case is complete.

Now consider n ≥ 4, and let x, y be the vertices in the length two L-sequence. For any pair of vertices
v1, v2 /∈ {x, y}, v1 must be adjacent to v2, else {x, v1, y} is a L-sequence. Thus, all vertices must be pairwise
adjacent, so G = Kn.

For the reverse direction, suppose by contradiction that G 6= Kn.

Let G be an n-vertex graph with L-sequence S = (v1, v2). By Lemma 3.1, v1 and v2 are adjacent.
If
N(v1) = N(v2), then N(v1) is not a clique by assumption. Let x, y be the two non-adjacent vertices in
N(v1). Then S′ = (x, y, v1) is a strictly longer L-sequence because x does not footprint y, y is not in N(x),
so y does not footprint x, and v1 footprints both x and y. This contradicts our assumption that S was
maximal.

If N(v1) 6= N(v2), without loss of generality, let u be a vertex in N(v1) but not in N(v2). Then S′ =
(u, v2, v1) is a strictly longer L-sequence because u footprints v1 and not v2, v2 footprints itself since u is
not adjacent to v2, and ﬁnally, v1 footprints v2. This contradicts out assumption that S was maximal.

Therefore, if γL

gr(G) = 2, G = Kn.

(cid:3)

It is worth noting that the empty graph on two vertices also has L-Grundy domination number equal to
two. This result on complete graphs motivates the study of sets of vertices who all have the same closed
neighborhood.

Proposition 3.3. Let G be a graph. If G contains three pairwise adjacent vertices v1, v2, v3 such that
N(v1) = N(v2) = N(v3), then γL

gr(G) 6= n.

Proof. For i 6= j 6= m ∈ {1, 2, 3}, N[vi] \ (N(vj) ∪ N(vm)) = {∅} since vi ∈ N(vj) ∪ N(vm), vj ∈ N(vm), and
gr(G) 6= n. (cid:3)
N(vi)\{vj} = N(vj)\{vi}. Thus, v1, v2, and v3 cannot all be included in an L-sequence, so γL

Thus, we know that if a graph on n vertices contains a clique of size k, in order for the L-Grundy number
to be equal to n, at most two of the vertices in the clique can have degree k − 1. There exists graphs with
cliques such that exactly two vertices have degree k − 1. For example, consider K3 with vertices v1, v2, v3
and attach a single vertex, v4 to v3 as shown in Figure 1. The sequence {v1, v2, v4, v3} is a L-Grundy
sequence of length four.

Figure 1. An example of a graph containing a clique K3 where two vertices have degree
k − 1 = 2. This has an L-grundy sequence of length four.

We can immediately deﬁne an inﬁnite family of non-tree graphs whose L-Grundy domination number is
equal to the number of vertices due to this result.

Corollary 3.4. For all n, there exists a non-tree graph G, |V (G)| = n such that γL

gr(G) = n.

Proof. Consider the graph Kk with vertices ui for i ∈ [k] and attach a degree one vertex, vi, to every vertex
except one, without loss of generality uk. Then, the L-sequence S = {uk, vi, ..., vk, u1, ..., uk−1}. Since
N[vi] \ ∪i−1

j=1N(vj) ∪ uk = {vi} and for i 6= k, N[ui] \ (∪i−1

j=1 N(vj) ∪ N(uk)) = {vi}.

j=1N(uj) ∪k

(cid:3)

3.2. Cycles.
Since all graphs except forests contain cycles, it is natural to determine the L-grundy number of a cycle
Cn, and attempt a characterization from there.

Lemma 3.5. For every n ≥ 3, γL

gr(Cn) = n − 1.

Proof. Let Cn = v1v2 · · · vnv1 We consider two cases; n even, and n odd.

We construct a L-sequence S as follows. The ﬁrst ⌈n/2⌉ vertices to be added to S are the vertices with odd

indices in increasing order. Immediately following are the vertices with even indices in descending order
excluding v2.

4

If n is even, Sn/2 = (v1, v3, . . . , vn−1) is a L-grundy subsequence because, with the exception of v1 and vn−1,
each vertex vi, with an odd index i, footprints vertex vi+1. In the case of v1, it footprints both v2 and vn
while vn−1 footprints itself. The remaining vertices form a L-sequence because, excluding vn, each vertex
vi, with even index i, footprints vi−1. vn footprints both v1 and vn−1.

The case for n odd is identical. S⌈n/2⌉ consists of all vertices with odd indices, while the remaining are those
with even indices in descending order, except v2. The only diﬀerence is that no vertices are required to
footprint themselves. Every vertex vi, with an odd index i, footprints vi+1 except v1 and vn. v1 footprints
both v2 and vn, while vn only footprints v1 since its even neighbor was footprinted by vn−2. Finally, every
(cid:3)
vertex vi with even index i footprints vi−1.

We can easily obtain a graph G′ whose L-Grundy domination number is equal to the number of vertices
by adding a single vertex and edge to Cn.

Theorem 3.6. Let G be an n-vertex graph obtained by attaching a leaf to a cycle. Then γL

gr(G) = n

Proof. Let Ck = v1v2 · · · vkv1 be a cycle on k vertices, and let u be a leaf attached to an arbitrary vertex
Ck. By relabeling the vertices of the cycle if necessary, we may assume u is adjacent to v2. From Lemma
3.5, we have a L-sequence S of length k − 1. We obtain a new L-sequence S′ from S by ﬁrst prepending
S with u, then adding v2 to the end. S′ is a L-sequence because, even though v1 no longer footprints v2,
(cid:3)
it still footprints vn, u footprints v2, and v2 is the only vertex that can footprint u, aside from u.

3.3. Families of graphs.
Let G be an n vertex graph such that γL
such that γL

gr(G′) = n′, where n′ is the number of vertices of G′.

gr(G) < n. We now give a method of obtaining graphs G′ from G

Theorem 3.7. Let G, |V (G)| = n. If γL
gr(G′) = 2n − k
γL

gr(G) = k < n, there exists a graph G′, |V (G′)| = 2n − k where

Proof. Let G be a graph on n vertices with γL
gr(G) = k < n where S is its maximal L-Grundy sequence.
Let G′ be a graph that is equal to G with a single vertex, vi connected to each vertex not in S, ui. Then,

S remained unchanged. Let S′ be

order, followed by all vertices in G \
S. This sequence has length 2n − k since there are n vertices in G
and n − k added vertices. It remains to show that S′ is a L-grundy sequence.

As stated earlier, S is a L-sequence. Let us denote the vertices of S as {xi}i∈[k] for some k ∈ N. Now for

Recall that S is a t-Grundy sequence if N(vi) \ ∪i−1
j=1N(vj) 6= ∅, for all i ∈ [k] \ {1}. The following
characterization of graphs with t-Grundy dominating number equal to the number of vertices was proved
by Brešar, Henning, and Rall in [10].

Proposition 3.8. [[10]] Let G be an n-vertex graph. γt
gr(G) = n if and only if there exists an integer k
such that n = 2k and the vertices can be labeled {x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk} such that the following holds. For
each i ∈ [k], xi is adjacent to yi, the set of vertices {x1, . . . , xk} is independent, and yj adjacent to xj
means i ≥ j.

If G is an n-vertex graph with γt
If G does not satisfy the conditions of
Proposition 3.8, then a new graph G′ can be obtained from G by adding a leaf to every vertex of degree 2
or higher such that γL
gr(G′) = n′ where n′ is the number of vertices in G′. The following theorem shows that
full L-Grundy number can be achieved by attaching leaves to every vertex with degree 3 or higher.

gr(G) = n, then γL

gr(G) = n.

Theorem 3.9. Let G be an n-vertex graph with at least one vertex of degree three or greater that satisﬁes
the condition that every vertex v ∈ V (G) such that deg(v) ≥ 3 has a neighbor of degree one. Then
γL
gr(G) = n.

Proof. We begin with an empty L-sequence S and add vertices to it in the following order: vertices of

degree 2, vertices of degree 1, and vertices of degree 3 or higher.

First, consider a vertex v of degree 2 such that each neighbor has degree 3 or higher. Since higher degree

vertices have not been added yet, v footprints such neighbors unless another degree 2 vertex has footprinted

them previously, in which case, v footprints itself. Therefore, if v has degree 2, and both of its neighbors

have higher degrees, then we add them in any order to S. Next, suppose that u and v are two adjacent

vertices with degree 2, and that each has a single neighbor of degree 3 or higher. If both of those higher

degree neighbors have not been previously footprinted, then it is clear that u and v are admissible to

S. If their neighbors have already been footprinted, then it is also clear that they may be added as u
would footprint v and vice versa. Finally, suppose that v1v2 · · · vn is a path (of degree 2 vertices) of length
n ≥ 3 such that the endpoints v1 and vn both have a single neighbor of higher degree. Then, we add
these vertices in the obvious order, stopped at vn−2. v1 footprints v2, v2 footprints v3, and so on. If the
higher degree neighbor of vn has not been footprinted, then we can add vn−1 and vn in that order. If it
has been footprinted, then we add vn before vn−1 since vn footprints itself, and ﬁnishing by adding vn−1,
which footprints vn. This completes the addition of all degree 2 vertices to S.

Next, it is clear that we may add all degree 1 vertices because they footprint themselves if their higher

degree neighbors have been previously footprint, or they footprint themselves and their higher degree

neighbors. And to ﬁnish, since every vertex of degree 3 or higher has a neighbor with degree 1, it must be
(cid:3)

added to S since it is the only vertex that can footprint the degree 1 vertices.

gr(G′) = n. This
This result implies that given any graph, G, we can derive a graph from it G′ such that γL
condition is not necessary for γL
gr(G) = n, however, as it was shown in [7], any forest on n vertices has an
L-Grundy number of size n, and there exists forests that do not satisfy this condition, such as a collection
of paths of length at least three.

4.1. Edge Removal.
In [8] it was shown how the Grundy dominating number changes under the operation of edge removal. In
6

4. Graph operations

particular, they showed that under single edge removal, the Grundy domination number can increase or
decrease by at most one. We show that the change in the L-Grundy number diﬀers slightly due to the fact
that vertices may footprint themselves. Indeed, we show that the L-Grundy domination number increases
by at most two or decrease by at most one.

Theorem 4.1. If G is a graph and e ∈ E(G), then γL

gr(G) − 1 ≤ γL

gr(G − e) ≤ γL

gr(G) + 2.

Proof. Let e = uv ∈ E(G) and set G − uv = G′. For the lower bound, let S = {v1, ..., vk} be a L-sequence
b
S, then S is an L- sequence of G′. Without loss of generality, let u be
of G. Let us consider G′. If u, v /∈
b

S gives an L-sequence of
G. This is because removing a vertex vi ∈

b
S. Removing u from S still gives an L-sequence of G′ since removing u from

b
S does not increase the size of ∪j∈JN(vj) for i ∈ J.

Without loss of generality, suppose u footprints v and v footprints y 6= u.

In G − e, u can no longer

footprint v, so if it does not footprint itself or another vertex, it is removed from the L-sequence. If v

does not have any other neighbor in
it. Thus, |S′| is equal to |S|, |S \ {u}|, |S ∪ {v′}|, or |(S \ {u}) ∪ {v′}|, where v′ is the footprinter of v.

b
S other than u, then we add the appropriate vertex that footprints

The only possibility in which we may need to remove two vertices from the L-sequence is if u, v ∈

b
S and

we have that u footprints v and v footprints u. If either u or v footprinted other vertices as well, then they

would be left in the L-set, so we assume that u footprints only v and v footprints only u. Without loss of

generality, we may assume that i(u) < i(v) and, since v footprints u, u footprints itself. Then, in G − e,
u still footprints itself, therefore u must remain in the new L-sequence. Indeed, let S′ be obtained from S
by removing v, thus, |S′| is equal to |S| − 1, |S|, or |S| + 1.

To see the upper bound, if S′ is an L-sequence of G − e, then S := S′ \ {u, v} is an L-sequence of G and
the result follows. Note that since a single edge is removed, all vertices not incident to edge and that were
(cid:3)
in S′ can still be included in S

Corollary 4.2. Let G be a graph and let G′ be obtained from G by adding k edges to G. Then γL
gr(G′) ≤ γL
γL

gr(G) + 2k.

gr(G) −k ≤

To illustrate these changes in the L-Grundy number, we now provide an example of a graph achieving
each value in the theorem’s bounds. Consider ﬁrst the increase in two of the L-Grundy number of a graph
G = K4 (cid:3) K2. We ﬁrst note that γL
gr(K4 (cid:3) K2) = 4. To see this, ﬁrst label the vertices of the K4’s with
{v1, v2, v3, v4} for the ﬁrst, and {u1, u2, u3, u4} for the second, and recall that vi is adjacent to ui. Suppose
gr(K4 (cid:3) K2) ≥ 5. Then there is at least one element from each K4 in S, i.e. at least
by contradiction that γL
one ui and at least one vj, and, without loss of generality, at least three elements in {u1, u2, u3, u4} are in
S. If exactly three ui are in S, then there are at least two elements from {v1, v2, v3, v4}. Thus ui and vi
and uj and vj in S. Notice, however, that ui and vi footprint everything, so the L-sequence is maximal
when they both are in S. The same is true for uj and vj. Thus, without loss of generality, place all ui
in S ﬁrst. This implies everything in G is footprinted except for one vk. Once either vi or vj is placed in
S, vk will be footprinted, so the other cannot be in S, as it has nothing to footprint. The proof for all
gr(K4 (cid:3) K2) < 5. In fact,
four ui being included in S is the same, except now no vi can be in S. Thus, γL
gr(K4 (cid:3) K2) = 4 since all ui can be in S. To see the L-Grundy domination number increase by two after
γL
removing an edge, let S = {u1, u2, u3, u4}. Suppose edge u1v1 is removed. Then u1 no longer footprints
v1, so by appending v1 to the end of S, followed by vi for i > 1, we have created a longer L-sequence by
two.

7

b
Consider the L-Grundy number of the complete graph, γL
S,
according to Theorem 3.2. Removal of e = uv from Kn now allows us to add any other vertex to the end
of S. If x is such a vertex, then our new L-Grundy sequence is (u, v, x) as u footprints every vertex except
v, v footprints itself, and x footprints both u and v.

gr(Kn) = 2. Let u and v be the two vertices in

Next, consider a cycle with a leaf attached, as in Theorem 3.6. If u is the leaf, then removal of any edge
not incident with u results in a tree, whose L-Grundy number is equal to the number of vertices. Since the
cycle with leaf has L-Grundy number equal to the number of vertices as well, it is clear that the L-Grundy
number remains the same.

Finally, to see a drop of one, consider the graph G obtained by taking two copies of a cycle Cn, n ≥ 3, and
adding a single edge between one vertex in each cycle. Clearly, γL
gr(G) = 2n − 1. By then removing the
single edge between the cycles, our disconnected graph now has L-Grundy number 2n − 2, as each cycle
on n vertices has L-Grundy number n − 1.

gr(H) ≤ γL

4.2. Vertex removal.
If S is an L-sequence for H, then it is also a L-sequence for G.
Let H be an induced subgraph of G.
Therefore γL
gr(G), and the L-Grundy dominating number is bounded above due to hereditary
graph properties. In [8], it was shown that for the Grundy dominating number, γgr(G) − 2 ≤ γgr(G − u) ≤
γgr(G). Similarly, it was shown in [11] that for the t-Grundy regime, vertex deletion aﬀects the bounds by
an identical amount. That is γt
gr(G). Since the L-Grundy number diﬀered from
the Grundy number under the graph operation of edge deletion, it is natural to assume there may be some
diﬀerence. In the following theorem, we show that despite this ability of vertices to footprint themselves,
the bounds remain the same for the operation of vertex deletion.

gr(G − u) ≤ γt

gr(G) − 2 ≤ γt

Theorem 4.3. If G is a graph and u ∈ V (G), then γL

gr(G) − 2 ≤ γL

gr(G − u) ≤ γL

gr(G).

Proof. Let S be an L-Grundy dominating sequence of G, and let u ∈ V (G) be the deleted vertex such that
G′ = G − u. Since G′ is an induced subgraph of G, we must have γL
gr(G). For the lower bound,

gr(G′) ≤ γL

L-sequence, we must also consider the eﬀect the removal of u has on the vertex that footprints u. Since a

vertex may be footprinted by at most two vertices, if v does not footprint itself or any vertices other than
(cid:3)
u, a new L-sequence S′ is obtained from S by removing u and v. Thus, |S′| = |S \ {u, v}| = |S| − 2.

We now provide a few examples of graphs satisfying the range of values in the above proof, showing the
bounds in the theorem are tight.

Consider the L-Grundy number of a complete graph, Kn, n ≥ 3. Clearly, γL
gr(Kn) = 2, and removing
any vertex, we have a Kn−1, whose L-Grundy number remains 2. To achieve γL
gr(G) − 1,
let G be a path Pn, n ≥ 2. Let u be an end vertex of the path and observe that γL
gr(Pn) = n. Then,
γL
gr(Pn − u) = n − 1. Finally, to see an L-Grundy number drop of 2, consider the graph G which is Cn with
a leaf attached, as in Theorem 3.6. Then γL
gr(G) = n + 1. By removing the leaf from G, we now have a
cycle with n vertices whose L-Grundy number is n − 1.

gr(G − u) = γL

5. Conclusion

We believe the problem of characterizing n-vertex graphs G satisfying γL
gr(G) = n to be diﬃcult. In this
paper, we have determined suﬃcient conditions for leaf placement in G, but determining the necessary
conditions proves to be more challenging. In [7], it was shown that every n-vertex tree T satisﬁes γL
gr(T ) = n
and that if G is an n-vertex graph such that γL
gr(G) = n, then δ = 1. We have proved that if G is a graph
gr(G) = k < n, then by obtaining G′ from G by attaching a leaf to each vertex of degree 3 or
such that γL

higher, we have γL
construct an inﬁnite family of graphs with only one degree one vertex such that γL
of this, we restate the following problem, originally proposed in [5].

gr(G′) = n′, where n′ is the number of vertices in G′. Furthermore, we were also able to
gr(G) = |V (G)|. In light

Problem 5.1 ([5]). Characterize graphs G with γL

gr(G) =| V (G) |.

In Section 4, we showed that the removal of any one edge resulting in the L-Grundy number increasing
by 2 or decreasing by 1. Clearly, if γL
gr(G) ≥ 3, the number of edges needed to make G a clique cannot
be added since a clique has L-Grundy number 2, but it would be interesting to determine which sorts of
structures permit stability in the L-Grundy number provided edges are added or removed.

In [8], it was shown that if G is a graph and e ∈ E(G), then γgr(G) − 1 ≤ γgr(G − e) ≤ γgr(G) + 1.
Moreover, there exists a speciﬁc graph G that realizes every value between γgr(G) − 1 and γgr(G) + 1
for diﬀerent edges in G. Similarly, if u ∈ V (G), there exists a speciﬁc graph G that realizes every value
between γgr(G) − 2 and γgr(G). We were unable to ﬁnd such a graph that realizes every value in the
bounds of Theorem 4.1 or Theorem 4.3. This motivates the following two problems.

Problem 5.2. Find a graph G such that all the values of γL
γL
gr(G) + 2 for some edges ej ∈ E(G), or prove that one does not exist.

gr(G − ej) are realized between γL

gr(G) − 1 and

Problem 5.3. Find a graph G such that all the values of γL
γL
gr(G) for some vertices ui ∈ E(G), or prove that one does not exist.

gr(G − ui) are realized between γL

gr(G) − 2 and
