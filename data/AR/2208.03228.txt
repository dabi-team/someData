ABSTRACT
Using time-sequence vector magnetic ﬁeld and coronal observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory, we report the
observations of the magnetic ﬁeld evolution and coronal activity in four emerging active regions (ARs). The ARs
emerge with leading polarity being the same as for the majority of ARs in a hemisphere of solar cycle 24. After
emergence, the magnetic polarities separate each other without building a sheared polarity inversion line. In all four
ARs, the magnetic ﬁelds are driven by foot point motions such that the sign of the helicity injection (dH/dt) in the ﬁrst
half of the evolution is changed to the opposite sign in the later part of the observation time. This successive injection
of opposite helicity is also consistent with the sign of mean force-free twist parameter (αav). Further, the EUV light
curves of the ARs in 94˚A and GOES X-ray ﬂux reveal ﬂaring activity below C-class magnitude. Importantly, the white-
light coronagraph images in conjunction with the AR images in AIA 94 ˚A delineate the absence of associated CMEs
with the studied ARs. These observations imply that the ARs with successive injection of opposite sign magnetic
helicity are not favorable to twisted ﬂux rope formation with excess coronal helicity, and therefore are unable to
launch CMEs, according to recent reports. This study provides the characteristics of helicity ﬂux evolution in the
ARs referring to the conservative property of magnetic helicity and more such studies would help to quantify the
eruptive capability of a given AR.

1 INTRODUCTION

Magnetic helicity (MH) is a physical parameter to measure
the structural properties of a magnetic ﬁeld. Using this pa-
rameter, one quantiﬁes twist, shear, linking, and kinking of
the magnetic ﬁeld (Moﬀatt 1978). MH is conserved to an
excellent approximation in the highly conducting plasmas
present in the Sun and heliosphere. In addition, the MH can
be transported between regions and between diﬀerent length
scales. Especially, helicity transfer between regions involves
either the bulk transfer of a helicity-carrying ﬁeld, or prop-
agation of twist and braiding along ﬁeld lines crossing the
boundary between the regions (Berger & Field 1984; Pevtsov
et al. 2014).

On the Sun, magnetic ﬂux emergence occurs in the local-
ized regions known as active regions (ARs), and are the po-
tential locations of the MH transfer from the convection zone
to the atmosphere. In these regions, the evolution of the mag-
netic ﬁeld is driven by slow plasma motions. These motions
are dominated by vertical components in the early emergence
phase and later dominated by horizontal components of ve-
locity (e.g., Magara & Longcope 2003). The equation for the
helicity transfer through the surface into the open volume
like solar corona was derived by (Berger 1984) and contains
shear and emergence terms. Using continuous observations
of the magnetic ﬁeld from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI;

Scherrer et al. 1995), Chae (2001), for the ﬁrst time, esti-
mated the helicity ﬂux transfer rate in the AR 8011. Later
several authors followed a similar method to estimate the he-
licity transfer rate during the AR emergence and later phases
of evolution (e.g., D´emoulin et al. 2002; Pariat et al. 2005;
LaBonte et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2008; Vemareddy et al. 2012;
Liu & Schuck 2012; Vemareddy 2015) to infer the coronal
helicity budget and then relate to the ﬂaring activity. How-
ever, the ﬂaring activity is primarily related to the magnetic
reconnection, which is sometimes associated with CME, so
the occurrence of a CME is of more fundamental and major
scientiﬁc interest in the space-weather point view. Since the
CME is the manifestation of twisted ﬂux rope (FR) eruption
(Rust & Kumar 1996; Vourlidas et al. 2013), formation and
existence of a twisted ﬂux rope in the AR magnetic struc-
ture is the key observational aspect to link the photospheric
helicity ﬂux transfer.

From the conservation property of the helicity, Zhang &
Low (2005); Zhang & Flyer (2008) proposed that an already
formed twisted ﬂux rope (twisted ﬂux) with continuous injec-
tion of MH inevitably erupts in order to remove the excess ac-
cumulated coronal helicity. First, twisted FR forms by shear
and rotating motion of magnetic foot points which implies
continuous injection of magnetic helicity of a predominant
sign. Second, the eruption requires further injection of helic-
ity upto a point of upper bound that the FR can remain in
equilibrium. Studies of long-term AR evolution showed that
the magnetic ﬁeld evolution with continuous injection of he-

licity with a predominant sign exhibits presence of twisted
FR as the sigmoidal structures and their eventual eruption
as CMEs (Liu et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 2014; Vemareddy et al.
2016; Vemareddy 2017; Vemareddy & Dem´oulin 2018). How-
ever, the estimation of the upper bound for a given magnetic
ﬂux distribution for the prediction of a CME occurrence is
still a formidable task, which leads to questionable Low’s con-
juncture of helicity upper bound.

Alternatively, in order to support the Low’s conjecture,
the recent studies search for the ARs with helicity injection
changing sign over time. In such cases, the coronal helicity
accumulation in the ﬁrst part of the evolution is possibly can-
celed by the later part. Therefore, the AR magnetic structure
can not reach the state of the helicity upper bound and is in-
capable of launching CMEs. Detailed study of the emerging
ARs 11928, 12257, the helicity ﬂux was found to change sign
from positive to negative over its evolution (Vemareddy &
D´emoulin 2017; Vemareddy 2021). Importantly, CMEs were
not launched from these ARs except the C-class ﬂaring ac-
tivity. Also, a twisted ﬂux rope structure was not present as
inferred by the non-linear force free magnetic ﬁeld extrapola-
tions. Such examples of the ARs provide evidence for the im-
portant role of conservation property of the MH in generating
the eruptive activity. In this paper, we present observations
of four ARs exhibiting changing sign of helicity ﬂux transfer
over time. In Section 2, observational data and analysis pro-
cedures are described, results are presented in Section 3 and
conclusions are given in Section 4.

2 DATA AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

In this study of helicity ﬂux evolution in the ARs, we used
uninterrupted high-resolution photospheric vector magnetic
ﬁeld observations obtained by the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012) on board Solar Dy-
namics Observatory. The HMI observes the full solar disk
in the Fe i 6173˚A spectral line at a spatial resolution of
0”.5/pixel. About the line center, full disk ﬁltergrams are
obtained at six wavelength positions to compute Stokes pa-
rameters I, Q, U, and V which are then reduced with HMI
science data processing pipeline (Hoeksema et al. 2014) to
retrieve the vector magnetic ﬁeld. We used data product
(hmi.sharp.cea_720s) at 12 minute cadence containing the
ﬁeld components (Br, Bθ, Bφ) in heliocentric spherical co-
ordinates which are approximately equal to (Bz, −By, Bx)
in Heliographic Cartesian coordinates. To limit the involved
project eﬀects, the emerging ARs of interest are chosen within
±40◦ longitude. In Figure 1, we displayed the example maps
of the vector magnetogram observations of the four ARs from
early to post emergence phase. In this ﬁgure, the horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld (arrows) is plotted on the map of the verti-
cal component of the magnetic ﬁeld. As the ARs evolve in
time, the opposite magnetic polarities grow in size with their
separation being increased.

From the these vector magnetogram observations of the
ARs, the velocity ﬁeld v is derived from DAVE4VM proce-
dure (Schuck 2008). We then computed the helicity injection
rate (Berger 1984) by

0.

To compare the sign of the dH/dt, we also compute the

mean force-free twist parameter (Hagino & Sakurai 2004)

which is also a measure of the non-potentiality of the AR
magnetic ﬁeld. Additionally, we derived the light curves of
the EUV emission of the AR in 94 ˚A obtained from the At-
mospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012). For
this, the AR patches are tracked in time at a time cadence of
3 minutes for the entire duration of the study.

3 RESULTS

To ascertain the role of helicity ﬂux in the generation of erup-
tive events, we need to know the coronal helicity budget which
is not known for already emerged AR. Therefore, we target
the emerging ARs within the visible disk. We found very few
cases of ARs exhibiting sign change behavior of injected he-
licity while the AR emerges and evolves. In the following, we
discuss the evolution of dH/dt and the accompanying activity
in four ARs as listed in the Table 1.

3.1 AR 11460

The AR 11460 started emerging on April 16, 2012 at
N15oE26o. We consider the AR observations between April
17 to 22 The leading polarity is negative consistent with the
most ARs in the northern hemisphere of solar cycle 24. The
time evolution of various parameters in this AR is shown in
Figure 2. The evolution of dH/dt is positive until the end
of April 20, which then turns negative thereafter. This sign
change of dH/dt is also consistent with the average force-free
twist parameter αav as shown in Figure 2a. The accumu-
lated helicity budget in corona will be monotonously increas-
ing until the sign of dH/dt is positive, which then decreases
when the sign of dH/dt becomes negative. This kind of dH/dt
evolution is a signature that the magnetic structure has not
reached the state of critical non-potential state. The light
curve of EUV emission of the AR in AIA 94 is plotted in
Figure 2c along with the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux. The peaks
in the AIA 94 light curve represent the ﬂaring activity in
the AR some of which are co-temporal with the GOES X-ray
ﬂux. It shows that the AR produced only C-class ﬂares not
associated with CMEs.

3.2 AR 12390

Another AR 12390 in our study emerged at E30oS15o on
July 24, 2015. Following the Hale polarity law, the leading
polarity of this AR is positive similar to other ARs in the
southern hemisphere. The ﬂux content in the AR grows to a
moderate level of order 1022 Mx as shown in Figure 3. The
time evolution of helicity injection dH/dt is positive deﬁnite

ﬂux of the AR in 94 ˚A and GOES X-ray ﬂux are plotted
in Figure 3c, which indicate that the AR exhibits very low
ﬂaring activity limited to B-class ﬂares.

3.3 AR 12644

The AR 12644 started emerging on March 25, 2017 at the disc
location E50oN15o. Following the Hale polarity law, a leading
negative sunspot was seen to grow in the course of AR emer-
gence and further evolution. We analyzed the observations of
this AR during March 25-30. In Figure 4, the time evolution
of the magnetic and emission parameters are plotted. The

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2022)

magnetic ﬂux of the both polarities increase till March 28
which then show a slight decrease behavior. Similar to earlier
two ARs, the time evolution of the dH/dt in this AR exhibits
sign-change nature from positive to negative values starting
from March 28. This trend of dH/dt is also consistent with
the average twist parameter αav. The GOES X-ray ﬂux and
EUV 94 AA ﬂux proﬁles are shown in Figure 4c, where some
of the peaks in EUV 94 ﬂux are co-temporal with the GOES
X-ray ﬂux. We noticed that the overall ﬂaring activity from
this AR is limited to C-ﬂares without CMEs.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The AR 12645 started emerging on March 27, 2017 at the
disc location E60oS10o. The leading polarity is positive as for
the most ARs in the southern hemisphere. In order to min-
imize projection eﬀects in our calculations of the magnetic
parameters, we analyzed the observations of this AR during
March 27 to April 3. As shown in Figure 5a, the ﬂux content
keeps growing as the AR emerges and spreads in spatial ex-
tent of ﬂux distribution. Unlike the previous AR, the dH/dt
evolution turns from negative sign values to positive from
mid of March 31, which is also consistent with the average
twist parameter αav. As shown in Figure 5c, few of the peaks
in EUV ﬂux are co-temporal with the peaks in GOES X-ray
ﬂux, which are identiﬁed as C-ﬂares without being associated
with CMEs.

We present the observations of four ARs with photospheric
ﬂux motions generating successive injections of opposite signs
of MH. Such ARs are outliers disobeying the hemispheric he-
licity rule (Rust & Kumar 1996; Pevtsov et al. 1995, 2008; Liu
et al. 2014) when evaluated from the observations of the on-
disk ARs. These ARs are somewhat not common, especially
of interest to shed light on the role of conservation property
of magnetic helicity for the launch of CMEs. From the point
of helicity accumulation, the ARs with change of dH/dt sign
over time may not favor the twisted ﬂux rope formation im-
plying to a state of smaller content of coronal helicity below
the eruptive threshold, therefore a CME eruption is unlikely
(Zhang & Low 2005; Zhang et al. 2006). On this line, recent
theoretical and numerical studies also propose the existence

of a helicity upper bound for the launch of a CME from an
AR (Zhang & Flyer 2008; Zuccarello et al. 2018).

ARs of predominant sign of dH/dt or strong αav indicate
strong twisted magnetic structures and typically appear as
sigmoidal shape in X-ray or EUV observations (Canﬁeld et al.
1999; Green et al. 2007; Romano et al. 2014; Vemareddy et al.
2016; Vemareddy 2017, 2019b; Dhakal et al. 2020). Since the
dH/dt is not with a predominant sign over the studied pe-
riod of observation, the ARs in this study have not built up
twisted structures (sigmoidal shapes). To this end, we an-
alyzed the time-sequence images in AIA 94 ˚A channel. In
Figure 6, representative images of AIA 94 ˚A observations of
the AR corona at three diﬀerent times are displayed. As no-
ticed, the coronal images exhibit plasma loops connecting the
simple bipolar ﬂux distribution (leading and following polar-

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2022)

ities) like a mildly sheared and/or potential arcade magnetic
structure. These loops have no signatures of sigmoidal shape
(Figure 6 and supported animation), as observed in many
erupting ARs (Canﬁeld et al. 1999; Gibson et al. 2002; Green
et al. 2002; Vemareddy 2017). Inspection of motion images
imply intermittent brightenings some of which are identiﬁed
as C-ﬂares in GOES X-ray ﬂux classiﬁcation. In addition, we
have also examined the LASCO white-light images1 in con-
junction with the AR evolution in AIA 94 images, which also
delineate the absence of associated CMEs with the studied
ARs.

In terms of eruptive nature, the magnetic ﬂux in the stud-
ied ARs is small compared to super ARs (e.g., Chen & Wang

2016). Since the helicity ﬂux scales with the square of the net
ﬂux (Φ2) in the AR, normalizing the helicity ﬂux with net
average ﬂux (dH/dt/Φ2)is useful as suggested by Vemareddy
(2017, 2019b). This quantity indicates the overall twisted-
ness of the AR, where a smaller value of normalized helicity
refers to a large fraction of the ﬂux being untwisted and act-
ing as background conﬁned ﬁeld. Such an idea of normalizing
non-potential parameters by magnetic ﬂux was used in the
recent statistical studies of Li et al. (2020, 2022) to ﬁnd the
CME association with the ﬂares. They suggested that the
ﬂares of the same GOES class from a larger ﬂux ARs are un-
likely to be eruptive. However, ARs of sign changing helicity
are very fundamental in that they are unlikely to form ﬂux
ropes in the ﬁrst place. Therefore, in order to disentangle the
eﬀect of background ﬁeld from the large value of helicity ﬂux

generated from ﬂux motions, it is important to normalize the
helicity ﬂux from ARs of small to large magnetic ﬂux content.
Also, we need to ﬁnd observational evidences of sign-changing
helicity ﬂux in several conﬁned ARs of diﬀerent size.

Further, the studied ARs have not developed long sheared
polarity inversion (SPIL) in the course of their evolution.
Several studies showed that the erupting ARs contain strong
SPILs over which twisted FR forms. These erupting ARs have
non-neutralized currents spread along the PIL such that the
net current is not balanced in a given polarity (T¨or¨ok et al.
2014; Vemareddy 2019a; Kazachenko et al. 2022). In our ARs,
soon after the emergence, the opposite polarities separate
each other so that SPIL cannot form. This study provides the
characteristics of helicity ﬂux evolution in ARs that are in-
