Abstract. The shell structure of even-even isotopes in Si, S, Ar and Ca has been
analysed. The theoretical calculations of shell closure parameter Dn(N ) and the
diﬀerential variation of the two-neutron separation energy dS2n(Z, N ) are carried out
within the framework of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Calculations are carried out
for diﬀerent skyrme forces and their sensitivity has been tested. Same nuclides are
studied by employing the relativistic mean ﬁeld aproach based on meson exchange and
point coupling models. Theoretically calculated estimates are in good agreement with
the recently available experimental data which fortiﬁes signature of shell closure at N
= 14 and 20 in case of Si, N = 14, 20 and 28 in S and N=20 and 28 in Ar and Ca
isotopes.

1. Introduction

In nuclear physics, understanding the structure of the atomic nucleus is one of the key
challenges. Certain conﬁgurations of nucleons (magic numbers) in nucleus are observed
to be more stable (magic nuclei).
Investigating the evolution of these magic nuclei
with nucleon number towards the dripline is an fascinating area of research in nuclear
physics [1]. The study of those nuclei which are lying far from the line of β-stability
play a crucial role in the understanding of nuclear physics. The production of the new
isotopes [2, 5] in recent years has revived the interest in nuclear structure models. This
provoked the development of radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities and highly sensitive
detectors to bring new discoveries [3, 4]. Till today, very little information is available
about those nuclei which are lying near driplines (exotic or halo nuclei).
Even though the number of undiscovered bound nuclei is very large but we are able to
make single big steps by studying a few of speciﬁc nuclei. These nuclei act as milestones
in setting new eﬀects that arise in extreme conditions of isospin asymmetry. We have
chosen Si, S, Ca and Ar nuclei for our interest as lot of research has been done on
these nuclei recently [2, 5, 39]. The microscopic structure of these nuclei is of particular
interest for the ﬁeld of astrophysics: the neutron-rich N≃28 nuclei play an important role
in the nucleosynthesis of the heavy Ca-Ti-Cr isotopes. As these nuclides also become
experimentally accessible, they can provide a testing ground for studying exotic nuclei.
In light to middle mass nuclei, the disappearance of the traditional magic numbers and
the appearance of new numbers far from the stability line is one of the main issues in the
nuclear structure physics of exotic nuclei. In ref. [6, 7], the weakening of the shell closure
for N = 28 has been reported by investigating the experimental 2+ excitation energies
of Si isotopes. Similarily, the conventional shell structure picture of magic numbers of
nucleons in stable nuclides is no longer applicable to the many exotic nuclei both in
[7, 8, 9, 5] for 42Si and in
theoretical and experimental extractions as reported in ref.
ref. [10, 11, 12, 13] for 42Si. In the chain of Ca isotopes, experimental studies strongly
mark N = 32 as a new magic number due to the high energy of the ﬁrst 2+ state in its
nucleus [14]
To study the physics of shell structure evolution in exotic neutron-rich and magic-
nuclei of Si, S, Ar and Ca isotopes near drip lines, we performed calculations based
on the self-consistent mean-ﬁeld theories: Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) with the
Skyrme eﬀective interactions [15, 16]. Also, the three-dimensional relativistic Hartree-
Bogoliubov (RHB) model with density dependent meson exchange (DD-ME2) and point
coupling (DD-PC1 and DD-PCX [36]) eﬀective interactions, are employed with separable
pairing interac- tion [17, 18, 35]. The physical observables of interest are nuclear binding
en- ergies, nuclear shell closure parameters Dn(N). Results of two-neutron separation
energies S2n(Z,N) and diﬀerential variation in two-neutron separation energies dS2n
(Z,N) are also presented.
The paper is organized as follows. A general overview of HFB model with eﬀective
skyrme interaction and the RHB model for density dependent meson exchange (DD-

3

ME) and point coupling (DD-PC) eﬀective interactions is presented in Section 2. In
Section 3, the results of our theoretical calculations are presented and compared with
the recently available experimental data. The results of the present work are summarized
in Section 4.

2. Theoretical Framework

The presented work has been done by using the models based on Hartree-Fock-
Bogoliubov Theory [19, 20, 15] and Relativistic Hartee Bogoliubov (RHB) Theory [21].
A brief discussion of these models is given below.

2.1. HFB Theory

This theory is a combination of Hartree-Fock (HF) and BCS theory.
In this theory,
the pairing ﬁeld and the mean ﬁeld are given equal footings. Details of the theory
can be extracted from our previous work [22] based on the zero range Skyrme eﬀective
interactions [16] used in the mean ﬁeld part. More details can be found in ref. [19, 20, 15].
Out of diﬀerent types of Skyrme forces like SLY5 [23], UNEDF0 [24], UNEDF1 [25],
SKP [26], and SKM* [27] etc.
that exists in the literature, we have adopted SLY5,
UNEDF0 and SKM* parameterizations because of their best eﬃciency in reproducing
the ground state properties of the nuclides of our interest. For the Skyrme forces, The
HFB Energy has the form of local energy density functional [28, 20, 15].
In the particle-particle (pairing) channel, pairing interaction is including the density
dependent delta interaction [45, 46] of the form [47],

where the saturation density [46] ρ0 = 0.16f m−3. Details can be obtained from the
corresponding references.

2.2. RHB Theory

We have employed Covariant Relativistic self-consistent mean ﬁeld models that are
similar to KohnSham density functional theory. We constructed the Nuclear Density
Functionals from Lagrangian densities based on meson exchange and point coupling
models. The pairing correlations of nucleons are considered by the relativistic Hartree-
Bogoliubov functional based on quasi-particle operators of Bogoliubov transformations.
These models are discussed brieﬂy in this subsection.

3. Results And Discussions

We present our results for Binding Energies, shell closure parameter Dn(N) and the
diﬀerential variation of the two-neutron separation energy dS2n(Z, N) for the isotopic
chains of Si, S, Ar and Ca nuclides. The theoretical calculations are carried out within
the framework of HFB theory and RHB theory discussed brieﬂy in the previous section.
HFB Calculations are carried out for diﬀerent skyrme parameterizations by using the
HFB code [15] with harmonic oscillator basis. RHB calculations are computed with
DIRHB code [17].

3.1. Binding Energies

Binding Energy is the underlying property of the nuclides which provides the deep
insights about the nuclear structure. Binding Energy refers to that energy which when
given to the nuclei, break it apart into its constituent nucleons. We have computed the
theoretical results of Binding Energy per nucleon (BE/A) for the isotopic chains of the
light to middle weight nuclides of Si, S, Ar and Ca. Theoretical Computation is done
with the Relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Nuclear Density
Functional Theory. Figure (1 and 2) represents the variation of the quantity ∆E against
the mass number A of particular nuclides. The quantity ∆E is deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between the Experimental Binding Energy [37] per nucleon and the Theoretical Binding
Energy per nucleon.

The theoretical results of binding energy shown in Figure (1) are calculated by using the
relativistic nuclear density functional based on meson exchange model parameters DD-
ME2 [29] (leftmost panel) and point coupling model parameters DD-PC1 [36] (middle
panel) and DD-PC1 [30] (right most panel). Figure (2) represents our theoretical

6

estimates of BE/A extracted with the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theory with Skyrme
parameterizations UNEDF0 [24] [23] (lefmost panel), SLY5 (middle panel) and SKM*
[27] (rightmost panel). Our theoretical results are matching reasonably with the
experimental results available [37]. Negative values of the quantity ∆E deﬁned in
equation (10) shows that the theoretical estimates just exceeds the experimental data
[37]. With the Relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov theory shown in
extracted from ref.
Figure (1), the absolute value quantity ∆E varies from 0.01 to 0.26 for Si isotopes, 0.01
to 0.25 for S isotopes, 0.01 to 0.17 for Ar isotopes and 0.01 to 0.11 for the Ca isotopes.
Absolute value of ∆E varies from 0.01 to 0.22 for Si isotopes, 0.01 to 0.23 for S isotopes,
0.01 to 0.21 for Ar isotopes and 0.01 to 0.15 for the Ca isotopes when the results are
calculated with Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory based on skyrme parameterizations as
shown in Figure (2).

3.2. Single-neutron separation energy and Shell closure parameter

Single-neutron separation energy denoted as Sn(Z, N)
(Z=proton number and
N=neutron number) is an important property of nuclei which acts as probe to identify
the signature of shell closures or its collapse by investigating the recently proposed
physical quantity Dn(N) [38]. The quantity Sn(Z, N) is deﬁned as
Sn(Z, A) = B(Z, N) − B(Z, N − 1)

(11)

where B(Z, N) represents the binding energy of the nuclei with atomic number Z and
neutron number N. The physical quantity Dn(Z,A) representing the shell closure is
calculated using the formula [38],

Dn(Z, N) = (−1)N +1[Sn(Z, N + 1) − Sn(Z, N)]

(12)

In Figures(3,4,5, and 6), we present our results of Single-neutron separation energy
Sn(Z,N) in MeV plotted as a function of neutron number N, for the chain of exotic
isotopic nuclei in Si, S, Ar and Ca. The theoretical results are extracted with RHB and
HFB model based on diﬀerent parameterizations mentioned in the individuals Figures
and their respective captions. The experimental values of Sn(Z,N) are computed from
the data of single neutron separation energies from [37]. Our estimates of Sn(Z,N) are
in good agreement with the experimental ones. Figures(7,8,9, and 10), represents our
results of theoretical shell closures Dn(Z,N) in MeV plotted as a function of neutron
number N, for the isotopic chain of nuclei in Si, S, Ar and Ca (see caption of ﬁgures for
required details). As reported in ref. [43], the isotopes of Si varying from 28Si to 34Si,
exhibit relatively high E(2+
1 ) = 3.33 MeV energies in 34Si nucleus which indicates the Z
= 14 as the new subshell gap with N = 20. However, it is also interesting to see that
the magnitudes of E(2+
1 ) energies gradually decreases from 1.4 Mev to 0.74 MeV in 36Si
to 42Si. This suggest and indicate the collapse of the N = 28 shell closure in 42Si nucleus
[7]. In the left panels of Figures (7 and 8), we observe the peaks in the Dn(Z,N) at
neutron number, N = 14 and 20, which gives the presence of shell closures. Afterwards,
there is decrease in values of Dn(Z,N) upto N = 30. In right panels of Figures (7 and 8 ),

7

we present the results of Dn(Z,N) for the isotopic chain of Sulphur. We observed peaks
in theoretical Dn(Z,N) values at neutron numbers, N = 14 and 20 and, a small peak
at N = 28 showing the weak shell closures. Dn(Z,N) val ues Extracted experimentally
[37] represent peak at N = 20 only with decrease in Dn(Z,N) values before and after
N = 20. The experimentally extracted Dn(Z,N) values has a peak at N = 16 in 32S
nucleus signiﬁes the sub-shell gap at neutrons ﬁlled 1s1/2 orbit in 0d-1s Shell orbitals.
Recent experimental measurements [13] of neutrons in ν1p3/2 orbitals in ground state
of 44S nucleus in 0f − 1p valence space fortiﬁes the collapse of N = 28 shell gap. The
Figures (9 and 10) represents the variation in Dn(Z,A) as a function of neutron number
for the isotopic chain Argon (shown in left panels) and Calcium (shown in right panels).
The theoretical and experimentally extracted Dn(Z,A) values are exhibiting peaks at
neutron numbers N = 20 and 28 in the isotopes of Argon and Calcium. These studies
suggest new shell structure at Z or N = 14 due to ﬁlled 0d5/2 orbit of 0d5/2 - 0d3/2
spin-orbit partner in 28Si, 30S, 32Ar and 34Ca nuclei in ground state. Experimental data
also fortiﬁes our theoretical estimates.

3.3. Diﬀerential Variation of Two Neutron Separation Energy

Just like the Single-neutron separatin energy Sn(Z,N) deﬁned in Equation 11, the
another term two-neutron separation energy S2n(Z,N) is equally important.
In the
given atomic mass region, the signature for the appearance and collapse of shell closures
is readily identiﬁed by examining the recently proposed physical quantity dS2n(Z,N) [40]
based on two-neutron separation energies. The two-neutron separation energy is deﬁned
as the energy required to remove two neutrons from a nucleus. It is calculated by using
the formula,

S2n(Z, N) = [B(Z, N) − B(Z, N − 2)],

(13)

We have calculated theoretically the results of S2n(Z,N) for even-even isotopes of Si,
S, Ar and Ca with the help of binding energies B(Z,N) and B(Z,N-2). Comparison
of theoretical results with the experimental data [37] is also done in our studies.
In
the Figures (11 and 12), we compared the theoretical and experimental results for two
neutron separation energy S2n(Z,N) as a function of neutron number N for the isotopes
of Silicon (left panels) and Sulphur (right panels). In the left panels of Figures (11 and
12), we observed a substantial drop in S2n(Z,N) values at 28Si and 34Si signaling the N
= 14 and 20 shell structure in isotopes of Silicon. In right panels of Figures (11 and
12), for the isotopes of Sulphur, we observed abrupt decrease in S2n(Z,N) at 30S, 36S
and 44S suggesting N = 14, 20 and 28 shell gaps. In Figures (13 and 14), we present the
results for S2n(Z,N) for isotopic chain of Argon (left panels) and Calcium (right panels).
We observed a substantial decrease in S2n(Z,N) at 32Ar, 38Ar and 46Ar, suggesting shell
gaps at N = 14, 20 and 28. However, in the case of Calcium, N = 14, 20 and 28
shell structure eﬀects are observed at 34Ca, 40Ca and 48Ca nuclei, respectively. These
substantial decreases in S2n(Z,N) values in Figures (11,12,13 and 14) indicate that the
energy required to remove two neutrons from (Z, N + 2) nucleus is much smaller than

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

the energy required to remove two neutrons from (Z, N) nucleus, where N represents
the number of neutrons at nuclear magic numbers .

Furthur, in order to get much deeper insight of two neutron separation energies
S2n(Z,N), the diﬀerential variation of the two-neutron separation energies dS2n(Z,N) are
also calculated by us using the formula [40],

8

dS2n(Z, N) =

S2n(Z, N + 2) − S2n(Z, N)
2

.

(14)

We have theoretically calculated dS2n(Z,N) and then compared with experimental data
In Figures (15,16,17 and 18), we present our results of diﬀerential
of S2n(Z,N) [37].
variation in two neutron separation energies dS2n(Z,N) for the even-even isotopes of Si,
S, Ar and Ca, plotted against neutron number N. It is very obvious and intriguing to note
that the trend of peaks in the dS2n(Z, N) values is similar to that of the discontinuities
in S2n(Z,N) values for the respective isotopic chains of nuclides as shown in Figures (11,
12, 13 and 14). The sharp decrease in the magnitude of dS2n(Z,N) values on either side
of a shell gap is also unison with other physical observables that are already discussed
in previous section for shell closures. In the upper panels of Figures (15 and 16), for the
isotopic chain of Silicon, the values of dS2n(Z,N) have peaks at N = 14 and 20 depicting
the neutron shell closures and suggesting disappearance of N = 28 magic number in 42Si
nucleus which substantiate the experimental investigations reported in ref.
[7]. In the
lower panel of Figures (15 and 16), we presented the variation of dS2n(Z,N) values in
the isotopic chain of Sulphur, indicate peaks at N = 14 and 20. In this case, there is
small peak in dS2n(Z,N) value observed in the 44S nucleus indicating shell gap at N =
28. It have been observed from experimental results [43] that the shell closure at N =
14 is also substantiated by the of E(4+
1 ) energies, 5.17 MeV at N = 14 in 30S decreasing
to E(4+
1 ) = 4.46 MeV at N = 16 in 32S nucleus. In Figures (17 and 18), the peaks in
the magnitude of dS2n(Z,N) are observed at neutron number N = 20 and 28 for both
isotopic chains of Argon and Calcium.

4. Conclusions

We have reached to some of the striking conclusions based upon our theoretical
estimations presented in this paper by employing Nuclear Density Functionals based
on Relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory
with the diﬀerent parameterizations discussed brieﬂy in the previous sections. The
shell structure of even-even isotopes in Si, S, Ar and Ca has been extensively analysed.
The shell closure parameter Dn(N) and the diﬀerential variation of the two-neutron
separa- tion energy dS2n(Z, N) are theoretically calculated and compared with the
recently availabe experimental data. Our theoretical Calculations are reproducing the
experimental data quite well with the tolerable discrepencies.
We presented the variation in binding energy per nucleon ∆E for the exotic nuclei of
Si, S, Ar and Ca. The absolute value of quantity ∆E varies from 0.01 to 0.0.26 for Si
isotopes, 0.01 to 0.25 for S isotopes, 0.01 to 0.17 for Ar isotopes and 0.01 to 0.11 for the

9

Ca isotopes as calculated with RHB theory whereas Absolute value of ∆E varies from
0.01 to 0.22 for Si isotopes, 0.01 to 0.23 for S isotopes, 0.01 to 0.21 for Ar isotopes and
0.01 to 0.15 for the Ca isotopes when the results are calculated with HFB theory. Also,
the presented theoretical extractions of shell structure properties and its interpretation
with experimental data suggests the signature of shell closure at N = 14 and 20 in case
of Si, N = 14, 20 and 28 in S and N=20 and 28 in Ar and Ca isotopes.
