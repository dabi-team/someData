Examining the Magnetic Field Strength and the
Horizontal and Vertical Motions in an Emerging
Active Region

Chia-Hsien Lin1 · Yu-Che Chen2

c(cid:13) Springer ••••

Abstract Earlier observational studies have used the time evolution of emerging
magnetic ﬂux regions at the photosphere to infer their subsurface structures, as-
suming that the ﬂux structure does not change signiﬁcantly over the near-surface
layer. In this study, we test the validity of this assumption by comparing the
horizontal and vertical motions of an emerging active region. The two motions
would be correlated if the emerging structure is rigid. The selected active region
(AR) NOAA 11645 is not embedded in detectable preexisting magnetic ﬁeld.
The observed horizontal motion is quantiﬁed by the separation of the two AR
polarities and the extension of the region. The vertical motion is derived from the
magnetic buoyancy theory. Our results show that the separation of the polarities
4 Mm hr−1 and decreases to
is fastest at the beginning with a velocity of
1 Mm hr−1 after the main growing phase of ﬂux emergence. The derived thick
≤
ﬂux-tube buoyant velocity is between 1 and 3 Mm hr−1 while the thin ﬂux-
tube approximation results in an unreasonably high buoyant velocity, consistent
with the expectation that the approximation is inappropriate at the surface
layer. The observed horizontal motion is not found to directly correlate with
either the magnetic ﬁeld strength or the derived buoyant velocities. However,
the percentage of the horizontally oriented ﬁelds and the temporal derivatives
of the ﬁeld strength and the buoyant velocity show some positive correlations
with the separation velocity. The results of this study imply that the assumption
that the emerging active region is the cross section of a rising ﬂux tube whose
structure can be considered rigid as it rises through the near-surface layer should
be taken with caution.

1. Introduction

Sunspots and solar active regions are zones with very concentrated magnetic
ﬁelds on the solar surface. How these regions are formed is one of the fundamental
problems in the study of solar magnetism. The formation process can be divided
into two problems: the ﬁrst one is how the magnetic ﬁelds are transported to the
surface, and the second one is how the sunspots and active regions are formed
from these ﬁelds after they rise to the surface.

The ﬁrst problem has been studied for more than half a century. Parker (1955)
was the ﬁrst to propose magnetic buoyancy as a viable mechanism to bring a
strand of toroidal ﬁeld to the surface. Since then, many works have been con-
ducted to include more realistic eﬀects to the model of magnetic ﬂux transport
through the solar convective zone. For instance, Sch¨ussler (1979) considered the
eﬀects of diﬀerential rotation, ﬂux loss and convective motions, and also derived
a mathematical expression for ﬂux tubes with arbitrary sizes. They found from
their numerical simulation that the shape of the ﬂux tube changes during the
rising. Caligari, Moreno-Insertis, and Sch¨ussler (1995) included the eﬀects of
spherical geometry and diﬀerential rotation in their numerical simulations, and
reported that their results were consistent with observed asymmetries, AR tilt
angles and emergence latitudes. Fan (2008) examined the eﬀects of magnetic
twist and Coriolis force. Weber, Fan, and Miesch (2011) applied a thin ﬂux-tube
model in a rotating spherical shell of turbulent convective ﬂows. The validation
of these models has usually been based on whether a model can qualitatively
produce the observed general properties such as Hale’s law, hemispheric tilt
and active latitudes. The detailed ﬂux transport processes implemented in these
models, however, is much harder to verify because the process takes place in
the invisible solar interior. The magnetic ﬂuxes only become observable after
they emerge from the photosphere. Some earlier studies used the temporal
evolution of emerging ﬂux regions (EFRs) or emerging active regions (EARs)
as a means to probe the invisible part of the ﬂux-tube structure and dynamics.
Speciﬁcally, they considered the time sequence of the observed EFRs and EARs
as snapshots of diﬀerent layers of the rising magnetic structure from top down,
and developed methods to reconstruct the subsurface structures (Tanaka, 1991;
Leka et al., 1996; Chintzoglou and Zhang, 2013). These studies were based on
the assumption that the structure does not change signiﬁcantly as it crosses the
surface, which, however, has not been veriﬁed observationally, and contradicts
some recent simulation results (e.g., Rempel and Cheung, 2014).

The second problem is how active regions are formed from the ﬁelds being
brought to the surface. Are they the result of a rising ﬁeld structure inter-
secting the surface, or are they formed by turbulence and/or convergence of
previously emerged small ﬁelds (e.g., Lites, Skumanich, and Martinez Pillet,
1998)? Although in this case the process is observable, it is diﬃcult to decipher
the actual physical mechanisms. This is because the gas density and pressure

change radically over a very thin layer across the surface, speciﬁcally, the plasma
β
1, which
means that the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld interact dramatically in this layer. As
a result, the ﬁelds are distorted, deformed, and restrengthened by the plasma
motions at this near-surface layer. In addition, since the physical scales of many
complex processes, such as turbulence, ﬂows, convection, and others, become
comparable with the scale of the magnetic ﬂux tube, simpliﬁcations such as
the thin ﬂux-tube approximation and the anelastic assumption are no longer
valid in this layer. Recent simulations have shown that the structure of the ﬂux
tube can be signiﬁcantly changed during ﬂux emergence across the near-surface
layer (e.g., Rempel, 2011; Rempel and Cheung, 2014). Brandenburg et al. (2011)
numerically demonstrated that a negative eﬀective magnetic pressure instability
(NEMPI) can lead to the formation of bipolar regions. A comprehensive review
can be found in Cheung and Isobe (2014). These models, simulations, and as-
sumptions should be veriﬁed before being applied to infer the physics associated
with EFRs and EARs.

An early study to test the magnetic buoyancy theory was conducted by
Chou and Wang (1987). They derived the buoyant velocities of 24 emerging
bipoles based on the magnetic buoyant force of the thick ﬂux-tube approxi-
mation (Sch¨ussler, 1979), and compared them with observationally determined
separation velocities of the bipoles. They found no correlations between the two
velocities. However, their study utilized line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms, and
was based on the simpliﬁcation that the separation speed and buoyant speed of a
bipole can be considered constant during the emergence. More recently, improved
observational and analysis techniques have enabled more accurate examination
of the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds of EFRs and EARs. Lites, Skumanich, and
Martinez Pillet (1998) conducted a high spatial resolution examination of the
vector magnetic ﬁeld and Doppler velocity ﬁeld patterns of three young bipolar
active regions in which ﬂux emergence could still be detected. They found that
the emerging horizontal magnetic elements had ﬁeld strength from
200 to
1 km s−1. These horizontal ﬁeld elements
600 G and upward rising speeds
rapidly moved away from the site of emergence to become more vertically ori-
ented, after which their ﬁeld strength increased to kilogauss values. Based on
their results, they suggested that the EFRs were caused by the emergence of
subsurface structures rather than by organized ﬂows near the surface. Kubo,
Shimizu, and Lites (2003) examined the internal structure of an emerging ﬂux
region. They divided the EFR into three regions: the main bipolar region, two
small emerging bipoles near the well-developed leading sunspot of the main
bipole, and the remaining part of the main bipolar region. By comparing the
evolution of the ﬁeld strengths and ﬁlling factors of the main bipole and the
small emerging bipoles, they deduced that the reorganization of the magnetic
ﬁelds by convective collapse (Parker, 1978) and ﬂux concentration is a possible
mechanism for the evolution of the EFRs. The subject of these two studies
was ﬂux emergence in preexisting active regions. Centeno (2012) studied the
emergence of two active regions that were isolated and not embedded in pre-
existing ﬁelds. They analyzed the relationship between the Doppler velocities
and the inclination angle, relative to LOS, of the magnetic ﬁeld vectors of all

magnetic ﬂux elements in the emerging active regions. They found that the ﬁelds
connecting two polarities were horizontally oriented with strong upward plasma
velocities while the magnetic ﬁelds in the footpoints were vertically oriented with
downward plasma velocities. In these studies, every magnetic ﬂux element was
treated as independent, and their statistical analysis was the basis to deduce the
possible formation mechanism(s) of their selected regions.

The aim of the present article is to test the assumption that an emerging active
region is formed by the emergence of a subsurface ﬂux structure whose dynamics
is mainly governed by the magnetic buoyancy mechanism and whose structure
can be considered rigid as it moves across the near-surface layer. For an ideal
rigid structure, its vertical and horizontal motions, being the two perpendicular
components of the total motion, are expected to be correlated. Our strategy is to
choose an EAR that qualitatively resembles the emergence of a single ﬂux tube,
and check whether any dependence exists between its horizontal and vertical
motions. The vertical motion is represented by the buoyant velocity as derived
by Chou and Wang (1987). We calculate the buoyant velocities in both thin ﬂux-
tube and thick ﬂux-tube approximations to check whether the approximations
are valid in the EAR. The horizontal motion is measured by the changing rates
of the separation of the two polarities, the “extension” of the region, and the
area of the entire region. We deﬁne “extension” as the size of the region in the
direction perpendicular to the line connecting the two polarities.

2. Data

The vector magnetograms used in this work are derived from the data taken by
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instruments (HMI: Schou et al., 2012) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and Cham-
berlin, 2012). The computation of the HMI vector ﬁeld products has been ex-
plained in detail by Hoeksema et al. (2014), and a brief description is given
here for completeness. The data are full-disk Stokes polarization parameters of
the spectral line Fe I 6173 ˚A sampled at six equally spaced wavelengths. The
Stokes vectors are then processed by the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector
(VFISV) code, which is implemented using the Milne-Eddington approximation
model of the solar atmosphere. Although the original observation cadence is
45 s, the data are averaged over a 16-minute tapered window during the VFISV
computation, rendering a cadence of 12 min. The results will be referred to as
“ME” hereinafter. The ME vector magnetograms are full-disk images of the total
ﬁeld,
, inclination angle, θB, and azimuth angle, φ. The inclination angle is
measured relative to the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, with 0◦ pointing out of the
image and 180◦ into the image. The azimuth angle is measured counterclockwise
(CCW) from the solar North, and contains the 180◦ ambiguity. In addition, due
to a combination of satellite and instrument roll angles, the ME data are rotated
by approximately 180◦ CCW relative to the actual solar images (Sun, 2013).
Since the analysis of this study is indiﬀerent to such rotation, the ME data were
not corrected for the rotation, except for visualization purpose.

Examining an Emerging Active Region

In addition to the full-disk magnetograms, HMI pipelines also provide active
region patches (HARPs), which are patches of emerging active regions automati-
cally detected and tracked. The detection and tracking are based on photospheric
LOS magnetograms and intensity images. The 180◦ azimuth ambiguity is re-
solved using Metcalf’s minimum energy method (Metcalf, 1994; Hoeksema et al.,
2014). The geometric information from HARPs is subsequently used to calculate
various space-weather related quantities at each time step to create Spaceweather
HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) 1. Two types of vector magnetic ﬁeld
data are oﬀered by SHARP: data in the CCD coordinates (hmi.sharp 720s)
and data that are remapped using a Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area projection
procedure (hmi.sharp cea 720s) such that the ﬁeld quantities appear as if they
were observed directly overhead (Calabretta and Greisen, 2002; Sun, 2013). The
former data product, which will be referred to as “SHARP”, contains total ﬁeld,
inclination angle and disambiguated azimuth angle. The inclination angle is rela-
tive to the LOS, and the azimuth angle is measured CCW from the solar North.
The mapped data series, which will be called “CEA” in this paper, contains
three ﬁeld vectors, Br, Bθ and Bφ, where ˆr, ˆθ, and ˆφ are the basis vectors of a
heliocentric spherical coordinate system (Sun, 2013).

3. Observations

The subject of this study is the emergence of AR 11645. Figure 1 illustrates
the location of its emergence on the solar disk as observed by HMI line-of-sight
magnetogram. The area of the ﬂux-emergence region and the sign of the magnetic
ﬂux concentration can be seen in more detail in Figure 2. The two white crosses
mark the approximate centers of the two main polarities when the average total-
ﬁeld strength of the whole emerging active region reaches maximum. The ﬁgure
shows that the area was initially free of preexisting magnetic ﬁeld and surrounded
by a ring of predominantly negative ﬁeld. A small positive ﬂux began to appear
between the two white crosses at approximately 12:58 UT on 2 January 2013. As
this positive region gradually increased its ﬁeld strength, multiple regions with
mixed polarities rapidly appeared between the two white crosses to ﬁll the region.
Although many of these new ﬂuxes did not show a preferred polarity orientation
when they ﬁrst emerged, they gradually oriented themselves along the East-West
direction, with the positive pole moving toward the right (solar West) and the
negative pole to the left, leading the whole region to a bipolar conﬁguration. This
is consistent with Hale’s law. The spatial range of the emergence analyzed in this

Because of the detection methodology, the HARP automated procedure be-
gins to record the data of an emerging ﬂux region only after the LOS magnetic
ﬁeld of the region has become suﬃciently strong and a sunspot is seen in the
intensity image. Therefore, while the SHARP and CEA magnetograms can pro-
vide the radial and horizontal components of the ﬁeld without ambiguity, they

often do not include the earliest stage of ﬂux emergence when the ﬁeld is mostly
horizontal and no sunspot has formed. Since the selected emerging active region
is located close to the disk center, we expect the diﬀerence between the LOS and
radial directions to be small. Therefore, in this study, we mainly used ME data,
and incorporated CEA data to check for the errors caused by the projection
eﬀect.

4. Analysis

4.1. Coalignment of ME and CEA images

The ME data are recorded in CCD coordinates with a spatial size of 0.5 arcsec
per pixel while the CEA data are mapped to a cylindrical equal-area coordinate
system with a spatial size of 0.03 degree per pixel. The standard CEA coordinates
(x, y) are related to the heliographic longitude and latitude (φ, λ) as follows
(Calabretta and Greisen, 2002; Sun, 2013):

x = φ
y = (180◦/π) sin λ,

(1)

in which the reference point is the disk center.

To correct for the foreshortening eﬀect in the CEA patches, a spherical co-
ordinate rotation is applied to Equation (1) to rotate the reference point to the
patch center, such that the result is an image observed directly from above (Sun,
2013):

are the heliographic longitude and latitude of this point and the patch center,
respectively.

To ensure that the same region is cut from the ME and CEA data, the pixel
coordinates of the boundary (i.e., lower-left and upper-right corners) of each
ME image are ﬁrst transformed into (φ, λ), then transformed into the CEA
coordinates using Equation (2), and ﬁnally converted into the pixel locations:

Figure 3 shows the comparison of some selected ME (left), and corresponding
SHARP (middle) and CEA (right) images. The ME images here have been
corrected for the 180◦ rotation for easier comparison with the SHARP and CEA
images. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the regions cut in the ME, SHARP,
and CEA images are consistent.

Examining an Emerging Active Region

4.2. Horizontal Motion

The geometry of the emerging ﬂux region was measured considering the sep-
aration of the two polarities and the extension of the region in the direction
perpendicular to the separation of the two polarities. The extension is used
as a proxy for the width of the ﬂux tube (see the sketch in Figure 4). For this
selected EAR, the separation of the two polarities is mostly in the East-West (X)
direction parallel to the Equator, and the extension of the region is mainly in the
South-North (Y) direction. Therefore, for the rest of the paper, the separation
and extension will be represented by dX and dY , respectively.

The temporal change of dX was determined from an X-t plot created by
(X, Y, t) over the Y direction. Since our interest is
averaging the total ﬁeld

ﬂux emergence and/or with strong magnetic ﬁeld, the peripheral area was not

so that the left should be right and vice versa. The white solid lines in the X-
t and Y-t plots of Figure 5 mark the starting point of the CEA data. The
two horizontal stripes in the X-t and Y-t plots (at t
200) were
caused by an unknown sudden change of the image intensity scale during the
observation. To check whether the determined edges encompass the main part
of the emerging ﬂux region, several selected ME and CEA images, marked by
the white crosses in the X-t and Y-t plots, were plotted in Figure 7 for ME data
and in Figure 8 for CEA data. The overplotted white boxes are the manually
determined boundaries. The ME images are, as noted earlier, 180◦ rotated.

The images in the ﬁrst two rows of Figure 7 show that the magnetic ﬂux
change is very dynamic during the earliest stage of the emergence: small ﬂuxes
can randomly appear at random locations with arbitrary orientation, and then
quickly disappear, dissipate, move away, change orientation or converge. This
dynamic appearance has little resemblance with the simplistic picture of a single
emerging ﬂux rope, as sketched in Figure 4, and causes uncertainties in the de-
termination of the boundary of the ﬂux emergence region. Despite such diﬃculty,
the white boxes do cover the main part of the emerging region, but do not always
include all of the ﬂuxes. We found that the excluded magnetic regions are often
preexisting ﬂux regions or ﬂux regions that have moved away and/or dissipated
quickly. Since our focus is the main part of the ﬂux rope, these outlying ﬂuxes
should not be included. After dX and dY were determined, (dX
dY ), which
will be referred to as (dXdY ) hereinafter, was used as a measure of area of
the cross section of the emerging magnetic ﬂux rope. The changing rate of all
these parameters was computed by taking the time derivatives: VX ≡

As shown in Figures 7 and 8, a large portion of the area bounded by dX and
dY have very weak magnetic ﬁeld strength. To calculate a meaningful average
magnetic ﬁeld of the emerging ﬂux region, the area with weak background ﬁeld
should not be included. To distinguish the emerging ﬂux region from the back-
ground ﬁeld, we applied a threshold to ﬁlter out weak-ﬁeld regions, that is, the
regions with

ﬁeld strength of the emerging ﬂux changes signiﬁcantly from the earliest stages
of emergence to its maximum value, the threshold should not be ﬁxed but should
be adjusted according to the stage of the emergence. The threshold should be
suﬃciently high to exclude most of the noise but also suﬃciently low such that
the initial emerging ﬂuxes are not overlooked. Since an emerging magnetic ﬂux

with Figures 9 and 10, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst four images are still very noisy after
the ﬁltering, indicating that
thr during the early stage of the ﬂux emergence is
comparable to the noise level, causing some stronger random noise to be included
as part of the emerging ﬂux region. However, since the only relevant output from
this ﬁltering process is the average total-ﬁeld strength, such imperfect ﬁltering
should not introduce signiﬁcant errors to
and the sub-
sequently computed Vbk and Vbn, as long as the ﬁeld strength of the included
noise is similar to that in the emerging ﬂux region. Our second observation
is that the ﬁeld vectors were predominantly inclined during the early stage of
emergence, but became more vertically oriented later. This is consistent with the
expected characteristics of a magnetic ﬂux tube rising through the photosphere,
and has been widely reported in both observations and theoretical models (e.g.,

5. Results and Discussion

The temporal proﬁles of the total unsigned ﬂux in the entire region cut from HMI
full-disk magnetograms are plotted in Figure 11 to show how the total ﬂux was
changing during the ﬂux emergence. The upper panel shows the results computed
from the original ME (black) and CEA (red) data without any ﬁltering. The
lower panel shows the results of the ﬁltered data, that is, only
thr
was included in the summation. Both plots show that the total ﬂux began to
increase around 2 January 2013 at 16:00 UT. The main emergence lasted for
approximately 16 hours until around 3 January 2013 at 08:00 UT, after which
the increasing rate became lower. Comparison between the two plots shows that
01:00 UT and 18:00 UT on 3
the unﬁltered results contain two spikes (at
January 2013) and a gap between the ME and CEA proﬁles. Both disappeared
in the ﬁltered result in the lower panel. This indicates that both features are
likely caused by the weak-ﬁeld noise.

VX and VY seem to be anticorrelated at the initial emerging phase, the two

the total strength and dissipation of the emerging magnetic ﬂux tube, while the
detailed temporal proﬁle of the motion in the two directions may be inﬂuenced
by more complex factors, such as surface ﬂows, turbulence, and others.

The third row shows that the average ﬁelds and buoyant velocities derived
from ME and CEA data diﬀer, with the CEA results (red) lower than the ME
results (black). The diﬀerence is especially prominent in Vbn vs. time. Comparing
the all-direction (higher) and inclined-ﬁeld (lower) curves in this row, it can be
seen that the two were almost the same at the beginning of the emergence, and

deviated from each other later. The gap between the two widened as

after these four quantities reached their respective peaks. These curves are qual-
itatively consistent with the image sequence in Figures 9 and 10. It can also be
noticed that the all-direction curves peaked slightly later than the inclined-ﬁeld
curves in all three panels. The plot of Vbn reveals that the buoyant velocity of the
thin ﬂux-tube approximation is about 20 times larger than the horizontal velocity
VX and VY , indicating that the thin ﬂux-tube approximation is inappropriate.
The peak Vbk is slightly smaller than the peak in VX and VY , but the three
speeds are generally of similar magnitudes.

Centeno (2012) examined the relationship between the inclination angles and
the Doppler velocities of all points in two emerging active regions that emerged in
a free ﬁeld environment. The scatter plots in the paper showed that the inclined-

Lites, Skumanich, and Martinez Pillet (1998) reported a higher upward Doppler

velocity of
of the regions selected by Lites, Skumanich, and Martinez Pillet (1998) was
located within some preexisting magnetic ﬁeld, which may have aﬀected the
rising motion of the emerging ﬂux.

An early study by Chou and Wang (1987), which used LOS magnetograms,
reported a thick ﬂux-tube buoyant velocity that was much larger than the sepa-
ration velocity. LOS magnetograms mainly detect the vertically oriented ﬁelds,
which usually have stronger ﬁeld strength and occur in the later stage of the ﬂux
emergence than the horizontally oriented ﬁelds (e.g., Kubo, Shimizu, and Lites,
2003). As revealed in our analysis, the separation of the two polarities quickly
slowed down to less than 1 Mm hr−1 after

cially in those in the right column. To quantify the level of the correlation, we
calculated and showed the correlation coeﬃcients (CCs) in the corresponding
panels. The results show that most of the correlation coeﬃcients are higher
than 0.5, indicating the existence of some positive correlation. The correlation
is stronger in the CEA data than in the ME data. As described in Section 2,
the CEA data do not include the earliest stage of ﬂux emergence when the ﬂux
is weak and can be contaminated by noise, and the ﬁelds have been properly
decomposed into radial and horizontal components. These facts can reduce the
inclined

errors in the determination of

the better correlation found in the CEA results. The correlation coeﬃcient also
reveals that the correlation is stronger for the all-direction quantities than for
the inclined-ﬁeld quantities. The inclined ﬁelds were thought to be the top of
emerging ﬂux tube. While the weaker magnitude and larger observational errors
of the inclined ﬁeld may partly contribute to the lower correlation, it can also
indicate that the simplistic assumption of a single ﬂux tube rising through the
photosphere may not be appropriate.

6. Summary

In this study, we compared the observed horizontal motion and the theoretically
derived vertical motion of an emerging active region to test the assumption
that it can be represented by the intersection of a rising magnetic tube, whose
dynamics is mainly governed by the magnetic buoyancy mechanism and whose
structure can be considered rigid or not signiﬁcantly distorted by surface and
near-surface eﬀects, as it crosses the solar surface.

The selected target is AR 11645. We tracked this AR emergence from the
earliest detectable appearance of magnetic ﬂux at
14:00 UT on 2 January
2013 until 23:59:59 UT on 3 January 2013. In this period of time, the average
06:00 UT on 3 January 2013. The region of
ﬁeld strength reached its peak at
emergence was initially free of preexisting ﬁeld, and was not associated with any
eruption during the ﬂux emergence process. At the early stage, many small and
transient ﬂux concentrations rapidly emerged with seemingly arbitrary polarity
orientations, and later organized in an East-West direction to form a bipolar
conﬁguration. Chou (1993) argued that this is an indication that the EAR is not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by local surface eﬀects.

4 hours after the ﬁrst sign of ﬂux emergence, reached its peak

4.0 Mm hr−1) approximately three hours later, and decreased to
velocity (VY ≈
≈

1 Mm hr−1 at the end of the observation time.
To investigate the vertical motion, we used the buoyant velocities of thin
and thick ﬂux-tube approximations derived by Chou and Wang (1987), and
of the EAR as
considered dY /2 as the ﬂux-tube radius and the average
the ﬁeld strength of the ﬂux tube. The computed buoyant velocities revealed
that the thin ﬂux-tube approximation is inappropriate because it results in an
unreasonably high buoyant speed. The thick ﬂux-tube buoyant velocity of the
inclined ﬁeld vectors has a similar magnitude as the the horizontal velocity of this
EAR, and is also consistent with the Doppler velocity of inclined ﬁelds reported
by Centeno (2012). This indicates that the magnetic buoyancy mechanism is
valid and that the emergence was largely governed by it.

The temporal proﬁles of the average ﬁeld strength and buoyant velocity show
a growing and a decaying phase, and are positively correlated. However, they do
not show a dependence or correlation with the observed horizontal motion. The
uncorrelation between the horizontal and vertical motions suggests that the as-
sumption that EARs are formed by the emergence of ﬂux tubes whose structures
remain constant as they cross the surface should be taken with caution.

Whether or not this relationship is a general property for emerging active regions

Figure 2. Selected HMI magnetogram cuts to show the emergence of AR11645. The obser-
vation times are indicated above the corresponding images. The size of a pixel in both X and Y
directions is 0.05 arcsec. The two white crosses mark the approximate locations of the centers
of the two polarities when the average total-ﬁeld strength of the whole emerging active region
reaches its maximum. The plotted quantity is the line-of-sight component of magnetic ﬁeld,
instead of the total ﬁeld, such that the two polarities can be distinguished.

Figure 3. Selected total ﬁeld (|B|) images to illustrate the accuracy of the alignment between
the cuts from HMI full-disk vector magnetograms (ME, left column), the Spaceweather HMI
Active Region Patches (SHARP; middle), and the Cylindrical Equal Area mapped patches
(CEA; right). The images in the same row correspond to the same observation time, which is
indicated above the left panel. The length of each pixel of ME and SHARP is 0.5 arcsec, and
that of CEA is 0.03◦, as indicated along respective axis.

Figure 5. Upper left, lower left, and upper right panels are |B|ave, X-t and Y-t plots created
by averaging the total ﬁeld data cube, |B|(X, Y, t), over t, Y and X dimensions, respectively.
The red vertical and yellow horizontal lines in the upper left panel indicate the ranges over
which the averages are done in Y and in X, respectively. The average range in t is the entire
observation time. The data cube is the HMI full-disk vector magnetogram product ME. Due
to a combination of satellite and instrument roll angles, |B|ave is rotated 180◦ with respect to
the real image, and the left and right of the X-t and Y-t plots are switched so that left should
be right and vice versa. In both X-t and Y-t plots, the vertical direction is time (12 min per
pixel), and the horizontal direction is length (0.5 arcsec per pixel). The magnitude of the total
ﬁeld in the X-t and Y-t plots is shown in the color bar in the lower right corner. The white
regions in the X-t and Y-t plots are the regions with ﬁeld strength higher than our plotting
maximum 403.4 G. |B|ave in the top left panel provides an overall idea of the emerging active
region, and therefore the exact ﬁeld strength is not shown. The red and white thick crosses
in the X-t and Y-t plots are the manually traced edges of the emerging ﬂux region (see the
text for the diﬀerence between them). The white horizontal line marks the starting point of
the HMI Active Region Patch data product (SHARP and CEA).

The red vertical and yellow horizontal lines in the upper left panel indicate the ranges over
which the averages are done in Y and in X, respectively. The average range in t is the entire
observation time. The data cube is the HMI Active Region Patch product CEA, and the plots
are in the same orientation as the real image. In both X-t and Y-t plots, the vertical direction is
time (12 min per pixel), and the horizontal direction is length (0.03◦ per pixel). The magnitude
of the total ﬁeld in the X-t and Y-t plots is shown in the color bar in the lower right corner.
The white regions in the X-t and Y-t plots are the regions with ﬁeld strength higher than

size in both X and Y directions is 0.5 arcsec, as indicated in the X-axis labels in the last row.
The areas with inclined ﬁeld vectors (50◦ < θB < 130◦) are painted in white to distinguish
them from those with more vertically oriented ﬁeld vectors. The quantity shown in the images

Figure 12. Measured quantities vs. time. The upper two rows show the quantities associated
with the horizontal motions (dX, dY , (dXdY ), and their temporal derivatives), and the
lower two rows show those associated with the vertical motions (h|B|i, Vbk, Vbn, and their
time derivatives). h|B|i, Vbk, and Vbn in the plots are the notations for the all-direction and
inclined-ﬁeld quantities. In the upper three rows, the red crosses and black triangles represent
the results of CEA and ME data, respectively. In the upper two rows, the thinner symbols
represent the results of individual edge-tracing of the X-t and Y-t plots to provide a visual
measure of the uncertainties of the plotted quantities, and their averages are plotted as thicker
ones to show their temporal proﬁles. In the third row, the higher curves correspond to the
all-direction results, and the lower ones the inclined-ﬁeld results. The solid lines are the results
of a third degree polynomial ﬁtting to the data. In the last row, black triangles, blue squares,
green crosses and red stars represent MEall, MEinclined, CEAall and CEAinclined, as indicated
