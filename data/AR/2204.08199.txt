Abstract: We report on a systematic characterization of microbulk Micromegas readouts in high-
pressure Ar+1%iC4H10 and Ne+2%iC4H10 mixtures. Experimental data on gain, electron trans-
mission and energy resolution are presented for a wide range of drift and ampliﬁcation voltages and
pressures from 1 bar to 10 bar for the argon mixture and from 5 bar to 10 bar in the neon mixture,
in steps of 1 bar. Maximum gains higher than 1.7×103 (1.7×104) in the argon (neon) mixture are
measured for all pressures, without the signiﬁcant decrease with pressure typically observed in other
ampliﬁcation structures. A competitive energy resolution at 22.1 keV, but with a slight degradation
with pressure, is observed: from 10.8% at 1 bar to 15.6% FWHM at 10 bar in Ar+1%iC4H10 and
from 8.3% at 5 bar to 15.0% FWHM at 10 bar in Ne+2%iC4H10. The experimental setup, procedure
and the results will be presented and discussed in detail. The work is motivated by the TREX-DM
experiment, that is operating in the Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc with the mentioned mix-
tures, although the results may be of interest for other applications of time projection chambers at
high pressures.

Introduction

Charge ampliﬁcation in gas is the basis for the readout of ionization signals in conventional gas time
projection chambers (TPCs). Normally optimized for operation at pressures close to atmospheric,
the performance of TPC charge readouts typically decreases with pressure. This is because the
eﬀects limiting the normal evolution of the avalanche, leading to streamers and eventually discharges
between the electrodes, appear earlier (i.e. at lower gains) in higher gas densities. The precursor of
these eﬀects is the production of ﬂuorescence photons in the avalanche, able to initiate secondary
avalanches at points separate from the primary avalanche location. The use of quenchers, small
amounts of additive gases that are opaque to these photons, is the usual strategy to limit these
eﬀects and obtain stable operation, although with an eﬀectiveness that may decrease at higher gas
pressures. It is expected that the particular geometry of the ampliﬁcation structure and the avalanche
also play a role, and that diﬀerent types of readouts show this eﬀect to a diﬀerent extent.

It is a general observation that gain ampliﬁcation substantially decreases when going to higher
pressures above atmospheric. For example, in [1] the maximum gain of a triple-GEM readout
in pure argon is measured to decrease from 105 at 1 bar down to 5 × 102 at 5 bar. Among the
diﬀerent types of micro-pattern gas detector (MPGD) technologies, it is known that Micromegas
readouts compare favourably in this regard, something that we have tentatively attributed to the
higher geometrical conﬁnement of the avalanche [2]. In a Micromegas readout all the ampliﬁcation
takes place in the ∼50-100 µm gap between a micromesh and the anode plane on which it is laid,
suspended by insulator pillars. For example, bulk Micromegas operating in Ar+2%iC4H10 have
shown a maximum gain drop from 3×103 at 1.2 bar down to 5×102 at 10 bar [3].

Microbulk Micromegas [4, 5] are a novel ﬂavour of Micromegas readouts, in which the
ampliﬁcation geometry is obtained out of doubly copper-clad kapton foils, by means of lithography
techniques and kapton etching. The resultant readout consists of a thin copper mesh separated from
the anode plane by a kapton structure (ﬁgure 1) . This technique oﬀers some improvements over
conventional Micromegas: the ampliﬁcation gap is more homogeneous and the mesh is thinner,
factors that reduce the avalanche ﬂuctuations and improve the energy resolution, to as low as 11%

(10.5%) FWHM at 5.9 keV in argon-(neon-)based mixtures at 1 bar [5] and of 7.3% FWHM at
22.1 keV xenon-trimethylamine (TMA) at 1 bar [6].

There is an important geometrical feature in microbulk detectors, due to the way they are
fabricated, by etching the kapton through the holes in the copper mesh. The ampliﬁcation gap is
opened right below each hole in the mesh, forming a cylindrical space in the kapton of diameter
slightly larger than the diameter of the corresponding mesh hole. In all the remaining area the kapton
is left untouched. This is diﬀerent than in bulk detectors, in which the insulator forms cylindrical
pillars periodically placed along the gap. This means that the avalanche in microbulk detectors is
highly conﬁned. Apart from the mesh hole, it is totally surrounded by kapton on the sides and
by the anode below. This feature considerably hinders the possibility of photons in the avalanche
to spread and could act as a geometrical quenching. This eﬀect has been tentatively invoked to
explain the remarkable observation that microbulk detectors present some gain even in pure noble
gases [7–9]. Similarly, this could be suggestive of an improved behaviour at high pressures (i.e. less
degradation with pressure), something that has already been experimentally observed in Xe-TMA
mixtures [6]. The results presented in this paper qualitatively conﬁrm this statement in Ar and Ne
mixtures. We report on a very mild decrease of the maximum gain with pressure (less than a factor
of 2 from 1 bar to 10 bar) in both the Ar and Ne mixtures tested (from 5 bar to 10 bar in the latter).

The work here presented has been carried out as part of the TREX-DM experiment, installed
in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc, LSC). TREX-
DM aims at the direct detection of dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) of
particularly low masses (below ∼10 GeV) [10]. The TREX-DM detector is a high-pressure TPC
able to host 0.16 kg of neon target mass at 10 bar (or, alternatively 0.3 kg of argon) and built out of
radiopure materials. The core of the experiment are two microbulk Micromegas readout planes with
an active area of 24.8×24.8 cm2 and with an X-Y strip pattern, the largest single microbulks built
so far. Ampliﬁcation in gas and extreme radiopurity levels show promise to reach the combined
low-threshold and low-background needed for a competitive low-mass WIMP sensitivity. The main
motivation for the use of microbulk readouts in TREX-DM is their good intrinsic radioactivity, as
they are very light structures composed of kapton and copper, two of the materials known to be
very radiopure [11]. Recent measurements have set an upper limit for the 238U and 232Th natural
chains of tens of nBq/cm2 [12]. TREX-DM is operated in high pressure (currently at 4 bar, but the

– 2 –

pressure could be increased up to 10 bar) with Ne+2%iC4H10 and possibly, in a diﬀerent run, with
Ar+1%iC4H101. The amount of quencher is set to make the mixtures non-ﬂammable, a fact that
facilitates an easier implementation of the experiment underground. The careful characterization
of microbulks in these mixtures is therefore needed to assess the performance of the detector. The
good behaviour with pressure that is here reported is an additional motivation for the use of such
readouts in the experiment.

These results can be of interest to other projects involving high pressure TPCs; an example
is the possibility of using a high pressure TPC as a near detector in future long-baseline neutrino
experiments. In Sec. 2 and Sec. 3, the experimental setup and the procedure are described. The
results in terms of electron transmission, gain and energy resolution are presented in Sec.4, and we
ﬁnish in Sec. 5 with the conclusions of this work.

2 Experimental setup

The experimental setup used in these measurements (ﬁgure 2, left) is a simpliﬁed version of the one
used in [6, 9]. The main component is a stainless steel vessel2, which can reach vacuum values of
∼ 10−6 mbar (and outgassing rates ∼ 10−7 mbar l/sec) and keep gas pressures up to 12 bar. Inside
the vessel there is an internal cylindrical chamber (total volume of 2.2 litres, 10 cm height and 16 cm
diameter) which can be accessed by a 15 cm diameter DN160CF ﬂange situated on the top. At
one side of the vessel, there is a DN40CF ﬂange equipped with four SHV feedthroughs for signal
extraction while at another side, there is a DN40CF outlet to pump the chamber and reduce the
release of trapped air or other impurities from elements inside the vessel. This pumping system
(composed of a turbomolecular pump and two vacuum gauges) is isolated from the chamber by an
all-metal valve and another vacuum valve in series. The vessel is also equipped with two DN16CF
ports situated at the front (inlet) and at the back (outlet) for the gas ﬂow. At the inlet of the vessel
there is a pressure transducer3, allowing to monitor the vessel’s pressure even when it is isolated
from the system via needle valves situated at the ports.

A 3 cm-long ﬁeld cage (ﬁgure 2, right) is placed in the inner chamber. This structure is
composed of a 10 cm diameter circular copper cathode and three copper rings. These elements are
mechanically ﬁxed together by three PEEK columns and are electrically linked one after the other
through 10 MΩ resistors. The cathode has a small hole at its center, where a cylindrical aluminium
container with a 109Cd deposition inside is situated. The bottom ring sits on a circular copper plate
(ﬁgure 3, left) which serves as a support for the microbulk Micromegas readout; the microbulk is
ﬁxed in a big hole at the center of the plate, isolated from the vessel by a Teﬂon rectangular base. The
cathode and the anode are electrically connected to the vessel feedthroughs and are independently
powered by a CAEN N470A and a CAEN N471 module to a negative and a positive voltage,
respectively. The copper plate is electrically connected to the Micromegas mesh, so as to extend
the equipotential surface deﬁned by the mesh, and set to the ground. The Micromegas readout is a
single, non-segmented anode covering a 2.4 cm diameter area. It is denoted as G50D55P100, as it

An event interacting in the active volume releases electrons, which drift towards the copper
plate and the Micromegas readout plane. If these primary electrons are above the active zone of
the plane, they will pass through the Micromegas mesh holes towards the higher-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation
region; then, they will be ampliﬁed in the gap and the charge movement will induce signals both
at the mesh and the anode. The anode signal is decoupled from the voltage level by a ﬁlter, whose
𝑅𝐶 constant minimizes the recovery time after a spark to ∼5 seconds, while the mesh signal is
not recorded for the measurements in this work. The anode signal is afterwards processed by a
preampliﬁer4, an ampliﬁer5 and is subsequently recorded by a Multichannel Analyzer (MCA)6.

The experimental procedure starts by pumping the vessel to pressures below 2 × 10−5 mbar and
outgassing rates around 9 × 10−7 mbar l/sec. These values are considered suﬃcient, as no evidence
of attachment in the gas has been observed in the readout performance. The all-vacuum valve is
then closed and the selected gas from a premixed bottle is injected into the vessel until a desired
pressure is reached; the two gas valves are closed and the gas remains static in the vessel during
the data-taking, i.e., in sealed-mode operation. After the data-taking, the gas pressure is either
increased by 1 bar to make a new measurement or the gas is removed and the vessel is pumped.

The readout has been characterized in terms of electron transmission, gain and energy resolution
in Ar+1%iC4H10 for pressures between 1 bar and 10 bar, in steps of 1 bar and was calibrated with a
109Cd source. The measurements in Ne+2%iC4H10 were performed from 5 bar to 10 bar in order
to contain the 22 keV energy peak of the source in the small volume of the setup. The calibration
spectra generated by the MCA (see ﬁgure 4) are characterized by the K-peaks of the source and
the ﬂuorescence emissions at 8.048 keV and 8.905 keV from the copper components of the vessel.
The mean position and the width of the Kα (at 𝐸α = 22.1 keV) is calculated through an iterative
multi-Gaussian ﬁt, previously used in [6], including both the K𝛼 and Kβ (at 𝐸β = 24.9 keV) emission
lines, their escape peaks and a linear background. The escape peaks are located at 𝐸 𝛼 − 𝐸gas and
𝐸β −𝐸gas, where 𝐸gas is the absorption energy of the gas, which is 2.974 keV for argon and 0.849 keV
for neon.

Ar+1%iC4H10 (left) and Ne+2%iC4H10 (right) at 10 bar. The spectral parameters are calculated through an
iterative multi-Gaussian ﬁt, which includes a linear background, the Kα (𝐸α = 22.1 keV, red line) and Kβ
(𝐸β = 24.9 keV, blue line) emission lines of the source and their escape peaks located at 𝐸α − 𝐸gas (magenta
line) and 𝐸β − 𝐸gas (green line). 𝐸gas is the absorption energy of the gas, which is 2.974 keV for argon and
0.849 keV for neon. The ﬂuorescence lines of copper (at 8.048 keV and 8.905 keV) are also present.

A wide range of ampliﬁcation and reduced drift ﬁelds has been scanned at each pressure. The
anode was varied, in steps of 10 V, from 200 V to 300 V at 1 bar and from 460 V to 580 V at
10 bar in Ar+1%iC4H10; for Ne+2%iC4H10 the corresponding values are from 290 V to 470 V at
5 bar and from 390 V to 560 V at 10 bar. Meanwhile, the drift ﬁeld was typically varied between
10 V/cm/bar and 300 V/cm/bar, except for pressures near 10 bar, where the ﬁeld was upper-limited

while the one of the energy resolution is less than 0.2% FWHM in the argon mixture and 0.3% FWHM in
the neon one.

ﬁelds translate to drift voltages of 30-900 V at 1 bar and 300-6000 V at 10 bar.

4 Results: electron transmission, gain and energy resolution

The electron transmission is the probability for primary electrons to pass from the conversion
volume to the ampliﬁcation gap through the mesh holes. Its measurement includes two mechanisms
that cannot be separated: the electron attachment and recombination in the drift volume, and the so-
called transparency of the mesh electrode. In order to measure it, the drift voltage is varied for a ﬁxed
anode voltage to obtain the dependence of the electron transmission with the drift-to-ampliﬁcation
ﬁeld ratio (ﬁgure 5, top) and the reduced drift ﬁeld at each pressure (ﬁgure 5, bottom). The fact
that the noise level during the measurements was not negligible, of the order of ∼ 9 × 104 electrons,
forced the starting point at detector gains of approximately 100. The speciﬁc anode voltages at
which each electron transmission curve was taken, as well as the gain and the energy resolution
at 200 V/cm/bar are shown in Table 1. As it can be seen, the detector gain was ﬁxed between
0.4×103 and 1.0×103 for Ar+1%iC4H10 and between 1.8×103 and 2.2×103 for Ne+2%iC4H10.
Although this is not an absolute measurement of the electron transmission, the fact that the signal
height and the energy resolution (ﬁgure 6) become independent of the drift ﬁeld suggests that the
mesh transmission is close to 100% in the plateau range and that the attachment and recombination
contributions are negligible, allowing to normalize the maximum value to the signal height. In
these measurements, we have normalized all values to the one measured at 200 V/cm/bar; the gain
variations along time have also been corrected.

The full transmission plateau is in all cases almost ﬂat for drift ﬁelds between 100 V/cm/bar
and 300 V/cm/bar, with a maximum variation of 3% for some pressures. At very low drift ﬁelds
(typically ∼ 10 − 20 V/cm/bar) the electron transmission is reduced by two eﬀects related to low
drift velocities: the charge collection time is longer than the ampliﬁer integration time (4 µs) and

Figure 5. Dependence of the electron transmission with the drift-to-ampliﬁcation ﬁeld ratio (top) and the
reduced drift ﬁeld (bottom) in Ar+1%iC4H10 (left, 1 bar to 10 bar) and Ne+2%iC4H10 (right, 5 bar to 10 bar).
The gain has been normalized to the gain value at a reduced drift ﬁeld of 200 V/cm/bar.

electron attachment and recombination of primary electrons generated in the drift volume are more
important. This drift ﬁeld threshold is similar to the one reported in [5] and can be explained by
the short drift distance in our setup and the combination of a high gas quality and a low outgassing
rate. At high ﬁelds, the conﬁguration of the ﬁeld lines makes that some electrons get trapped in
the mesh electrode. This eﬀect causes a drop in the mesh transmission and degrades the energy
resolution. However, neither an electron transmission drop nor a degradation in energy resolution
has been observed in our measurements. According to [5], the full transmission plateau should
range for ﬁelds up to 150 V/cm for both gases at 1 bar and the detector gain should respectively
drop a 20% and 13% when the drift ﬁeld is increased to 300 V/cm. We have attributed the absence
of this eﬀect to the wider mesh holes of our readout, whose diameter is 55 µm in comparison to the
35 µm of the reference.

After the measurement of the electron transmission, the drift ﬁeld is set to 200 V/cm/bar, where
a full mesh transparency is systematically achieved. The anode voltage is then varied from very
low ampliﬁcation ﬁelds, where signals are just at the noise threshold, up to the spark limit, where
micro-discharges between the mesh and the anode plane produce a current higher than 300 nA,
resulting in a trip of the high-voltage power supply. After a trip, the working voltage is normally
recovered within a few seconds but as a ﬁxed criterium, the data-taking is concluded if the trip rate

and Ne+2%iC4H10 (right, 5 bar to 10 bar).

exceeds one every 30 sec. The position of the 22.1 keV peak at the MCA is used to calculate the gain
of the Micromegas readout plane, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of electrons after the avalanche
(𝑛) and the number of primary electrons (𝑛0). To obtain 𝑛 for each peak position, the electronic
chain was previously calibrated with a squared-pulse generator and a capacitor. The number of
primary electrons 𝑛0 is the ratio of the peak energy (22.1 keV) and the mean energy necessary for
creating an electron-ion pair in the gas, which is 26.3 eV for argon and 36.4 eV for neon [13]. The
contribution due to isobutane has been disregarded because of its low concentration.

The gain curves obtained in Ar+1%iC4H10 for pressures between 1 bar and 10 bar and in
Ne+2%iC4H10 between 5 bar and 10 bar are shown in ﬁgure 7. The readout shows a maximum
attainable gain before the spark limit higher than 1.7 × 103 in the argon mixture and higher than
1.7 × 104 in the neon mixture for all pressures. The uncertainty of this point is of the order of
15%, owing to the 10 V-step in voltage of the data-taking procedure. The maximum gain hardly
decreases with pressure: in Ar+1%iC4H10 from 3.4 × 103 at 3 bar down to 1.7 × 103 at 10 bar; while
in Ne+2%iC4H10 it drops from 3.1 × 104 at 5 bar down to 1.7 × 104 at 10 bar. This reduction is lower
than the one observed in Xe-TMA mixtures for microbulk technology [6], where the maximum gain
dropped from 4 × 103 at 1 bar to 4 × 102 at 10 bar; and in Ar+2%iC4H10 for bulk technology [3],
where the maximum gain reduced from 3 × 103 at 1.2 bar down to 5 × 102 at 10 bar. And it is even
lower than the dependence reported in [1] for a triple-GEM gaseous detector in argon, where the
maximum gain reduced from 105 at 1 bar down to 5 × 102 at 5 bar.

The energy resolution (expressed in FWHM) of the readout plane is obtained from the width
of the gaussian ﬁt. Its dependence with the absolute gain is shown in ﬁgure 8 for all pressures. The
statistical error of the energy resolution, derived from the errors from the gaussian ﬁt parameters, is
less than 0.2% FWHM in Ar+1%iC4H10 and 0.3% FWHM in Ne+2%iC4H10 for all gains, except
for low gains where it exponentially increases. At each pressure there is a range of gains for which
the energy resolution is optimized. At low gains, the energy resolution degrades because the signal
becomes comparable to the electronic noise. At high gains, the resolution degrades due to the
increase in the gain ﬂuctuations by the UV photons generated in the avalanche [14].

As it is shown in ﬁgure 8, the energy resolution at 22.1 keV is degraded with pressure, being

and Ne+2%iC4H10 (right, 5 bar to 10 bar). The maximum gain of each curve is obtained just before the spark
limit. There is an uncertainty of ±1 V in the high-voltage power supply, which produces a systematic error
of ∼0.5% in the determination of the ampliﬁcation ﬁeld.

10.8% FWHM at 1 bar and 15.6% FWHM at 10 bar for the argon mixture. For the neon mixture,
the energy resolution at 22.1 keV worsens from 8.3% FWHM at 5 bar to 15.0% FWHM at 10 bar.
All these values are better than those measured with the bulk readout of TREX-DM in [3], where
a degradation from 16% FWHM at 22.1 keV at 1.2 bar to 25% FWHM at 10 bar was observed.
Nevertheless, we do not discard that the energy resolution at low pressures may be limited by the low
quantity of quencher, as better values have been measured for microbulk technology in [5]: 11.7%
and 10.5% FWHM at 5.9 keV in Ar+5%iC4H10 and Ne+5%iC4H10, respectively, which translates
to 6.0% and 5.4% FWHM at 22.1 keV if we suppose only an energy dependence.

5 Conclusions and prospects

As part of the commissioning of the TREX-DM experiment, the performance of a non-pixelated mi-
crobulk Micromegas readout has been characterized in two non-ﬂammable mixtures: Ar+1%iC4H10

– 9 –

and Ne+2%iC4H10, for pressures between 1 bar (5 bar for Ne) and 10 bar, in steps of 1 bar. The
readout shows a maximum attainable gain before the spark limit higher than 1.7 × 103 in argon
and in the case of neon higher than 1.7 × 104 for all pressures. The maximum gain decreases
with pressure by only a factor 2: in Ar+1%iC4H10 from 3.4 × 103 at 3 bar down to 1.7 × 103 at
10 bar; while in Ne+2%iC4H10 it drops from 3.1 × 104 at 5 bar down to 1.7 × 104 at 10 bar. The
energy resolution at 22.1 keV also shows a degradation with pressure: from 10.8% FWHM at 1 bar
to 15.6% FWHM at 10 bar in Ar+1%iC4H10; and from 8.3% FWHM at 5 bar to 15.0% FWHM at
10 bar in Ne+2%iC4H10. These results satisfy the criteria set by the TREX-DM experiment for gain
and energy resolution, and might be of interest for other applications where high pressure TPC are
involved.
