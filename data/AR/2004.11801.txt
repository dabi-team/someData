Abstract: 

Reduced  titanium  dioxide  has  recently  attracted  large  attention,  particularly  for  its  unique  co-

catalyst-free H2 heterogeneous photocatalytic application. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of 

the reduced TiO2 was previously ascribed to the introduction of point crystal defects (mainly Ti3+ 

centers), which result in the formation of intrinsic co-catalytic centers and enhanced visible light 

absorption. In this work, we systematically investigate the effect of different defects in the TiO2-x 

lattice on photocatalytic H2 evolution. To introduce different types of defects, thermal annealing 

in air (oxidative), Ar (inert), Ar/H2 (reducing), and H2 (reducing) atmospheres were performed on 

commercially available anatase nanopowder. Then, the powders were characterized by scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron 

microscopy (HR-TEM) to clarify the effect of treatment on material properties. Furthermore, the 

defect types were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We show 

that  thermal  annealing  in  different  atmospheres  can  form  different  amounts  of  different  defect 

types  in  the  TiO2  structure.  The  highest  photocatalytic  activation  is  achieved  by  annealing  the 

anatase  powder  in  a  reducing  atmosphere  for  an  appropriate  temperature/annealing  time.  By 

combining  the  results  from  H2  generation  and  EPR  analysis  we  show  that  the  simultaneous 

presence of two types of defects, i.e. surface exposed Ti3+ and lattice embedded Ti3+ centers, in an 

optimum low concentration, is the determining factor for an optimized photocatalytic H2 evolution 

rate.  In  fact,  annealing  anatase  powder  under  the  so-reported  optimized  conditions  in  reducing 

atmosphere  leads  to  the  generation  of  a  considerable  amount  of  H2,  with  rates  as  high  as  338 

µmolh-1g-1.

Introduction:  

2 

 
Titanium  dioxide  (TiO2),  and  particularly  its  anatase  polymorph,  is  still  the  most  investigated 

semiconductor  for  photocatalytic  H2  generation  by  virtue  of  its  exceptional  photocorrosion 

resistance,  low  cost,  and  suitable  band-edge  positions  for  H2  formation  from  H2O  [1–3]. 

Thermodynamically, photo-generated conduction band electrons, ejected by UV irradiation, are 

able to reduce H2O to H2. However, due to a sluggish kinetics of electron transfer from TiO2 to 

electrolyte, and owing to trapping and recombination of charge carriers, the efficiency of such a 

photocatalytic system is very low. [2,4,5] 

To tackle these limitations in charge transfer, co-catalysts, mostly noble metal nanoparticles 

(NPs)  such  as  Pt,  Au  and  Pd,  are  used  [5,6].  They  act  as  electron  sinks  and  facilitate  efficient 

electron-transfer across the interface. However, due to the high cost of noble metals, alternative 

approaches could be based on intrinsic doping by charge transfer mediators, i.e. the formation of 

suitable  Ti3+  centers,  introduced  by  oxygen  vacancies  (VOs)  in  TiO2  lattice.  Reports  on  the 

successful creation of such  species are mainly centered on exposing TiO2 structures to a high-

temperature treatment in various reducing atmospheres (e.g., vacuum, Ar, Ar/H2, and pure H2).[7–

10] 

In 2011 Chen et al. reported for the first time that upon a H2 thermal treatment at 200 °C under 

high pressure, a defective structure is formed (black TiO2) and has a high photocatalytic activity 

for H2 generation if Pt is used as a co-catalyst. The authors attributed the enhanced performance 

of black TiO2 to the increased light absorption due to the narrowing of the optical band gap of 

black  TiO2  to  1.54  eV.  [1]  Later  on,  in  2014  Liu  et  al.  reported  on  significant  open  circuit  H2 

evolution from grey TiO2 nanotubes and from grey anatase, without the use of any noble metal as 

co-catalyst.[8,11] Liu et al. ascribed the high open-circuit hydrogen generation of the hydrogenated 

anatase to the formation of Ti3+ species which act as cocatalytic centers facilitating electron transfer 

3 

 
to the solution.[11] Different methods of TiO2 reduction, such as high energy ion implantation, 

[12] electrochemical reduction, [13] and hydride ball milling, [14] have then been reported to lead 

to  hydrogen  generation  without  using  any  noble  metals.  Liu  et  al.  found  that  photocatalytic 

hydrogen evolution of the black TiO2 is mainly ascribed to the specific defect formation and not 

coupled  with  their  visible  light  absorption  behavior.[8–10,15,16]  This  finding  was  further 

investigated in more detail and confirmed by Mohajernia et al. studying the effect of visible light 

absorption  versus  conductivity  on  the  enhanced  photoelectrochemical  performance  of  reduced 

TiO2 nanotubes.[15] Measuring the open-circuit hydrogen evolution of reduced TiO2 nanotubes 

under  visible  irradiation,  the  authors  proved  the  established  visible  light  absorption  hardly 

contributes  at  all  to  H2  generation.[15]  The  aforementioned  studies  clearly  establish  that  Ti3+ 

species play a crucial role in photocatalysis of titanium sub-oxides. The reported active material 

have in common that (the key) Ti3+ is present only in very low concentration. It is, however, well 

known  that  detection  of  Ti3+  species  in  minute  amount  is  challenging  with  common 

characterization  techniques  such  as  XRD,  XPS,  TEM  or  EDX.  An  outstanding  technique  to 

elucidate on different types of Ti3+ centers is the use of an electron spin sensitive technique. The 

most precise method for investigating the alterations in terms of detecting the presence and type 

of  paramagnetic  species  in  reduced  TiO2  structure  is  electron  paramagnetic  resonance 

spectroscopy (EPR). Reduction of TiO2 associated with removal of oxygen atoms from the lattice 

results in formation of paramagnetic Ti3+ sites. Based on previous EPR studies on defective TiO2, 

the main spin containing centers usually formed in TiO2 from synthesis are a) Ti3+ centers located 

in regular lattice positions, b) surface exposed Ti3+, c) interstitial Ti3+, and d) oxygen ions with a 

trapped  hole  (oxygen-based  radicals)[8,11,16–19].  Although  several  studies  observed  the 

formation of various signals of Ti3+ in reduced samples, there is no systematic study that correlates 

4 

 
the  types  of  spin-containing  defects  with  the  photocatalytic  activity  of  reduced  TiO2  structures 

[8,11,16,20–22].  

In the present work, we performed such a systematic investigation on a variety of reduced TiO2 

materials and critically discuss the possible correlation between number (spin concentration) and 

types of point defects with the experimentally observed photocatalytic activity of reduced TiO2 

anatase powders. Point defects were formed intentionally under inert (Ar), reductive (Ar/H2 and 

H2) and oxidative (air) conditions and at different temperatures, in order to vary both the defect 

identity and the total amount. We observe that a subtle balance of embedded and surface exposed 

defects in low concentration does have a large impact on enhancing the photocatalytic activity of 

TiO2 nanostructures. This balance of defects can be adjusted by annealing anatase powder under 

mild temperature conditions and in reducing atmosphere; the balanced presence of surface exposed 

and lattice embedded Ti3+ sites in low concentration leads to a considerable amount of H2, with 

rate as high as 338 µmolh-1g-1 under 365 nm illumination. On the contrary, the introduction of a 

high concentration of spin containing sites obtained from the use of reducing atmospheres under 

harsh  conditions  is  detrimental  for  the  photocatalytic  performance.  Similar  detrimental  results 

were also obtained when oxidative or inert annealing conditions were employed. 

Result and discussion  

Figure  1a  shows  optical  images  of  anatase  powders  thermally  treated  in  air,  Ar,  Ar/H2  and  H2 

environments at various temperatures for 1 hour. The images illustrate that the color of the powders 

treated in air and Ar atmosphere remain almost unchanged, while an obvious color transition from 

white  to  black  for  the  powders  reduced  in  Ar/H2  and  H2  atmosphere  from  300°C  to  900°C  is 

evident.  Figure  S1a-d  compares  the  corresponding  absorbance  spectra  of  the  thermally  treated 

5 

 
 
anatase samples. Figure 1b compares the spectrum in different atmosphere at a fixed temperature 

of 500°C. The absorption spectra  are  well in  line with  color changes in  optical  images and. as 

anticipated, show high absorbance in the UV range, corresponding to the bandgap of TiO2 (3.2 eV 

for  anatase  and  ~  3.0  eV  for  rutile).  The  absorbance  spectra  of  the  powders  treated  at  Ar-500, 

Ar/H2-500 and H2-500 show a tail in the visible range, which is in general most significant for the 

H2 and Ar/H2 treated samples. Although the absorption results may suggest visible photo-activity 

of the darker nanopowders, this point needs to probed by photocatalytic measurement in visible 

range,  which  will  be  discussed  in  the  photocatalysis  section  of  this  paper.  In  Figure  S1e-h  the 

absorption spectra are re-plotted according to the Kubelka-Munk equation. Band gap evaluation 

results show that the TiO2 powder annealed in oxidative (air) and inert (Ar) environment show a 

band-gap decrease that we can ascribe to the transformation of anatase to rutile phase at elevated 

temperature  (700oC)  as  verified  by  the  XRD  (below).  Noteworthy,  for  the  powders  treated  in 

reducing atmosphere (Ar/H2 and pure H2) this transformation is postponed, and at 900oC no band 

gap  can  be  evaluated  for  these  samples.  This  can  be  ascribed  to  phase  changes  to  semimetalic 

phases [23], as later confirmed by XRD.  

Figure  1  c-f  and  Figure  S2-5  show  the  SEM  images  of  the  anatase  powder  treated  at  different 

temperatures  and  environments.  Figure  1  c-f  indicate  that  by  thermal  treatment  of  the  anatase 

nanopowders up to 500°C in Ar/H2 atmosphere, the powder size remains intact, while by further 

increasing  the  annealing  temperature,  the  nanopowders  start  sintering  which  results  in  a 

significantly increased TiO2 powder size (even particles with diameter >500 nm can be observed 

after annealing at 900°C – see Fig. S6). Also in other atmospheres a similar trend was observed. 

The SEM images in Figure S3-5 show a comparison of annealing environment. The nature of the 

environment does not have a significant effect on particle size, whereas temperature plays a crucial 

6 

 
role in sintering – see particle average size in Figure S7. This is in line with previous reports on 

pressure-less sintering behavior of TiO2 powders [24,25]. TEM images in Figure S8 also confirm 

the particle size dependency on temperature and show the sintering effect at elevated temperatures. 

It has been reported that reduced TiO2 structures show in some cases an amorphous shell around 

a crystalline core. To investigate the formation of this amorphous shell, high-resolution TEM was 

made  for  a  core  sample  in  this  report  that  is  the  500°C  Ar/H2  treated  powder;  however,  no 

amorphous shell was detected (Figure S9).  

XRD measurements were carried out on pristine and thermally treated TiO2 nanopowders in Ar 

and Ar/H2 environment and are presented in Figure 1g,h. The diffractograms identify anatase phase 

of TiO2 (JCPDS Card no. 21-1272) in the pristine sample and the samples which were annealed 

below 500°C; while by increasing the annealing temperature conversion to rutile phase (JCPDS 

Card no.71-0650) is initiated. However, dependent on the annealing environment, the temperature 

and extent of transition from anatase to rutile phase varies, i.e. the conversion from anatase to rutile 

is  facilitated  (occurs  at  a  lower  temperature)  in  oxidative  (air)  and  inert  environment  (Ar)  as 

compared to a reductive environment (Ar/H2 and H2 ) (see Figure 1c,d and Figure S10 a,b). To 

compare the phase content in different environments and different temperatures more precisely, 

Rietveld analysis was performed and the data are summarized in Table S1. The quantitative data 

confirm the facilitated transformation of anatase to rutile in oxidative and inert environment. Thus, 

SEM,  XRD,  and  TEM  results  jointly  confirm  that  powder  morphology  and  crystallographic 

structures (anatase) all remain unchanged by annealing at temperatures below 500°C. 

In order to study the photocatalytic behavior of the different thermally treated TiO2 powders, open 

circuit photocatalytic H2 evolution was measured using 2 mg powder dispersed in water/ methanol 

(50:50) solution and illuminated by 365 nm LED. Figure 2a shows the comparison of H2 evolution 

7 

 
rate of the pristine anatase powder and the powders treated in air, Ar, H2 and Ar/H2 atmosphere in 

different temperatures. The results show that air as well as Ar annealing treatment do not have any 

significant impact on the open circuit H2 evolution and it is almost identical to the amount of H2 

generated from the non-treated anatase powder. Therefore, the small amount of H2 evolved from 

these samples is ascribed to the self-activation of the anatase powder under UV illumination – this 

effect  was  previously  investigated  thoroughly  by  Wierzbicka  et  al.  [26].  However,  for  the 

thermally  treated  powders  in  reducing  environment  at  500  °C,  the  H2  generation  rates  are 

significantly  enhanced.  For  higher  annealing  temperature,  however,  they  steadily  decay.  This 

decay  at  elevated  temperature  can  be  observed  for  all  the  samples,  regardless  of  annealing 

environment.   In order to determine the contribution of visible light absorption (c.f. Figure 1b) in 

photocatalytic H2 evolution of pristine and thermally treated powders, photocatalytic H2 evolution 

was  measured  under  450  nm  laser  irradiation  (see  Figure  2b).  The  results  do  not  show  any 

photocatalytic activity in the visible range. In the UV range, it is worth mentioning that samples 

reduced in Ar/H2 and H2 show a very similar trend and slightly higher hydrogen evolution rate for 

the sample which was treated at 500°C in H2 environment, in contrast to earlier results [27]. 

To study the effect of treatment time, anatase powder was treated at 500°C for 15 min to 960 min 

in Ar/H2 (see Figure 2c). The results show that photocatalytic H2 evolution rate increased for the 

samples  treated  in  Ar/H2  up  to  480  min;  however,  by  further  increasing  the  time  of  thermal 

treatment in reducing atmosphere, the photocatalytic activity started dropping significantly. Please 

note that for all samples XRD shows no change in crystallinity. 

To  understand  the  difference  in  nature  of  the  defect  types  and  how  they  can  affect  the 

photocatalytic  activity  of  the  treated  powders,  electron  paramagnetic  resonance  spectroscopy 

(EPR) was employed at X-band frequency (9.15-9.16 GHz). Figure 3a-d show the EPR results of 

8 

 
the air, Ar, Ar/H2 and H2 treated powders recorded at 123 K. Table S2 collects the estimated g-

tensor  values  from  EPR  analysis  associated  to  the  various  spin-containing  sites,  and  includes 

evaluation of the total spin concentration as obtained from comparison with CuSO4 spin standard. 

From Figure 3a-d, all TiO2 samples annealed at 300°C under various atmospheres exhibit similar 

EPR resonances, with low intensity signals arising from lattice embedded Ti3+ sites. These signals 

show the usual g tensor values known for these Ti3+ spin containing species, falling in the range 

1.99-1.97 for the g-perpendicular (x,y) component [28]. The recorded EPR signatures suggest that 

the low temperature treatment does not lead to the formation of a significant defective structure in 

the TiO2 system. By increasing the annealing temperature to 500°C, significant differences start to 

emerge in response to the diverse atmosphere used during annealing. When TiO2 is annealed under 

air (Figure 3a, Air-500 trace), besides the presence of lattice embedded Ti3+ resonance, a broad 

EPR resonance arising from Ti3+ sites that are surface exposed appears clearly (around g = 1.93), 

together with signals arising from trapped holes (at g > 2.0023) [17]. 

In Ar atmosphere and at 500°C (Figure 3b), multiple signatures from lattice embedded Ti3+ sites 

exhibiting different rhombic distortions evolved, with gx,y components falling at 1.998 and 1.993. 

Moreover,  an unusual and  strong  hole signature  appears  in  the low field region,  featuring  gz  = 

2.011, gy = 1.971, gx = 1.921. These g-tensor values are rather unusual; we speculate that such 

signature arises from an oxygen-based radical (hole) being trapped well below the nanoparticle’s 

surface and spatially located close to the Ti3+ spin containing site. These spin containing sites do 

not contribute in enhancing the proclivity of the system in the photocatalytic H2 production (see 

Figure 2a) but rather appears to hamper the electron transfer process to H+. Similar hole species 

exhibiting comparable g-tensor values (gz = 2.010, gy = 1.970, gx = 1.921) emerge also in the TiO2 

sample  treated  in  air,  but  only  when  the  higher  annealing  temperature  is  employed  (Fig.  3a, 

9 

 
annealing temperature 700 °C, Air-700 trace) and remain present as well in the Ar sample annealed 

at 700 °C (Figure 3c, Ar-700 trace). In the Supporting information (Figure S11), as an example an 

EPR  simulated  resonance  envelope  is  given  (calculated  in  the  spin-Hamiltonian  framework  by 

perturbation theory approximation) of the air-700 sample, from which it becomes evident that an 

unusually large contribution stems from hole species (34% contribution of the total spin density). 

The Ar/H2 and H2 samples annealed at 500 °C (Figure 3c and Figure 3d) show very different EPR 

resonance signatures compared to the Ar treated counterpart (Figure 3b) and appear rather similar 

to the Air-500 sample (Figure 3a). In Ar/H2 and H2, the resonance features observed are attributed 

to  Ti3+  sites  that  are  lattice  embedded  (gx,y  around  1.99),  to  hole  centers  (e.g.  surface  TiIV-O 

centers, with g values > 2.0023) and Ti3+ sites that are surface exposed (with gavg around 1.93). 

The major difference between Ar/H2 and H2 samples annealed at 500 °C is the larger amount of 

spin containing defects that are generated in H2 at 500 °C (5.33  1018 spin/g, see also Table S2 

and  Figure  3e),  compared  to  those  estimated  in  the  Ar/H2  (3.00    1018  spin/g).  Increasing  the 

temperature up to 700 °C shows that the samples annealed in air and in Ar behave again similarly 

to each other, exhibiting both the dominant presence of the hole signature. However, while the 

total spin density increases upon increasing the temperature in the Air sample (from 2.00  1018 

spin/g at 500°C to 4.52  1018 spin/g at 700 °C), for the Ar sample the reverse process occurs (from 

3.52  1018 spin/g at 500°C to 1.52  1018 spin/g at 700 °C). A further increase in the temperature 

up to 900 °C induces a total loss in the EPR resonance signals in the Air sample and leaves a very 

small amount of spin containing sites in the Ar sample (0.47  1018 spin/g). As for Ar/H2 and H2 

treated TiO2 powder, their behavior at high annealing temperature (700-900 °C) is very different 

to both Air and Ar treated samples, showing that when a more reducing environment is used and 

higher annealing temperatures are reached, a boost in the generation of spin containing sites is 

10 

 
observed. In fact, the Ar/H2 and H2 treated samples at 700 °C and 900 °C (Figure 3c and Figure 

3d)  show  very  similar  EPR  resonance  signatures,  namely  they  display  a  strong,  broad,  and 

unresolved resonance line around gavg = 1.95, with total spin density that significantly increases 

upon temperature increase (at 700 °C and 900 °C, see Table S2 and Figure 3e). Taking together 

these  results  from  EPR  analysis,  some  additional  information  on  the  temperature  induced 

generation  of  spin  containing  defects  in  these  TiO2  materials  can  be  drawn.  The  temperature 

dependency of vacancy generated in a crystalline material can be expressed by Eq.(1): 

Eq. (1) 

where Nv is the vacancy concentration, QV is the energy required for vacancy formation, kB is the 

Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and N is the concentration of atomic sites. This 

equation is valid for a crystalline and solid material and is regardless of annealing environment, 

i.e., by increasing the temperature the number of vacancies increases exponentially to stabilize the 

increase in the entropy of the crystal. This is clearly occurring in all samples tested, as validated 

from spin density estimation, in the temperature range 300 °C to 500 °C (see Table S2 and Figure 

3e).  The process of additional defects generation should continue until it starts to interfere with a 

physical phase transition (melting, or a solid-state phase transition). Taking the case of air and Ar 

annealed  samples,  embedded  oxygen  vacancies  increase  until  a  rutile  transformation  induces  a 

drop in the number of defects (see Figure 3a and 3b) with almost complete loss at 900 °C.  

For the samples treated in the Ar/H2 and H2 environment the EPR results and spin concentration 

estimation show that with increasing temperature, in addition to the enhancement of embedded 

defects which can be explained by Eq. 1, the signals from the surface exposed vacancies are also 

increased significantly. This is well in line with the previous proposed mechanism of defect 

11

formation in a reducing environment which state that reducing agent (in this case H2) will react 

with the surface exposed oxygen atoms and eliminate the oxygen atoms from the lattice surface 

[29]. 

Intense EPR signals of the surface exposed Ti3+ for the powder treated at 900°C in Ar/H2 and H2 

reveals that by increasing the annealing temperature, this type of spin containing sites become the 

dominant species (gavg ~1.95). Based on the EPR results, it seems that the high number of defects 

present in reducing atmosphere at high temperature indeed prevents formation of photogenerated 

charge separation and favors, on the contrary, their fast recombination (probably a coulomb effect, 

due to the presence of an already large electric field all over the material). 

In order to remove  the impact of rutile formation that arises from an increase in the annealing 

temperature, we reduced the samples at 500°C but using different time intervals. Figure S10c show 

the XRD result of the powder treated in Ar/H2 at 500°C in different time intervals. XRD results 

indicate anatase phase for all the samples treated  for different  times.  Interestingly, EPR results 

show  a  very  similar  trend  of  transformation  from  embedded  defects  to  fully  surface  exposed 

defects for the sample treated for longer times at 500°C in Ar/H2 (See Figure S12). Combining the 

time and temperature dependent results we suggest that in a reducing environment the number of 

surface exposed defects and embedded defects can be tuned by changing the time and temperature 

of the annealing. Figure S13 provides a schematic image of the surface exposed and embedded 

oxygen vacancy (Ti3+) sites. For simplicity purposes, the crystals are presented along the 001 and 

010 directions. 

Comparing the EPR signals of the optimized samples in terms of photocatalytic activity in inert 

and reducing atmosphere and also the EPR spectra of the sample treated in Ar/H2 in an optimized 

time, we suggest that a low density mixture of embedded and surface exposed Ti3+ sites seems 

12 

 
vital for achieving the highest photocatalytic activity, while it is detrimental to pursue high amount 

of defects induced. However, it is still unclear if such low-density admixture of spin containing 

defects  are  directly  entering,  as  active  sites,  in  the  hydrogen  photoproduction  or,  rather,  their 

presence brings in a more efficient generation of other photoactive spin containing species during 

turn-over.  Nevertheless,  the  present  work  shows  clearly  the  significance  of  optimized  defect 

engineering  toward  the  “right”  combination  that  is  the  key  pre-requisite  to  generate 

photocatalytically active sites for H2 generation. 

Conclusion 

In summary, we provide a systematic investigation of anatase and the introduced defects as a result 

of  thermal  treatment  in  an  inert,  an  oxidative  and  in  a  reductive  environments  using  EPR 

spectroscopy.  We  demonstrate  that  reducing  TiO2  powders  in  different  environments, 

temperatures  and  time  intervals  leads  to  powders  with  a  wide  range  of  optical  and  electronic 

characteristics.  More  importantly,  the  various  thermally  treated  powders  contain  distinctly 

different defect types. Based on the EPR results, we prove that the presence of an optimized level 

of two types of defects, namely surface exposed Ti3+ and embedded Ti3+ is the key to obtain a 

drastically enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation from TiO2 surfaces.  

Experimental 

Anatase powder samples were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (purity 99.8%, particle size: 25–35 

nm). Thermal treatment of the powders was carried out by annealing in air, Ar and Ar/H2 10% at 

different temperatures. For open-circuit photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements, the powder (2 

mg)  was  dispersed  in  10  mL  oxygen-free  aqueous  methanol  (50  vol.%)  solution  to  prepare  a 

suspension in  a quartz tube. The suspension was illuminated  either  under  365 nm  LED.  A  gas 

13 

 
chromatograph (GCMS-QO2010SE, SHIMADZU) with TCD detector was used to measure the 

amount  of  H2  generated.  The  absorbance  of  the  samples  was  measured  between  200–1000  nm 

(Avantes,  AvaLight-DH-S-BAL,  using  cable  IC-DB26-2).  The  blank  quartz  glass  was  used  as 

reference. A Teflon standard was used as background. The band gap evaluation was performed 

using Kubelka-Munk equation: 

[𝐹(𝐹)ℎ𝐹]

1

2 = 𝐹(ℎ𝐹 − 𝐹𝐹) 

where A is a constant, F(R) is the Kubelka-Munk function and Eg is the band gap. 

The morphology of the samples was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy 

(Hitachi S4800). Transmission electron microscopy was carried out with a Philips CM30 TEM. 

X-ray  diffraction  (XRD),  performed  with  an  X’pert  Philips  MPD  (equipped  with  a  Panalytical 

X’celerator detector) using graphite monochromized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å), was used 

to analyze the crystallographic properties of the materials. Rietveld Analysis was performed on 

XRD diffractograms using a MAUD software by Luca Lutterotti[30]. 

EPR spectra of the TiO2 powder samples were recorded on JEOL JES-X-320 operating at X-band 

frequency  (~9.15-.16  GHz),  equipped  with  a  variable  temperature  control  ES  13060DVT5 

apparatus.  The  cavity  Q  quality  factor  was  kept  above  6000  in  all  measurements  and  signal 

saturation was avoided by working under low-applied microwave power (applied Pa << 1.0 mW). 

Highly-pure quartz tubes were employed (Suprasil, Wilmad, ≤ 0.5 OD). The EPR spectra were all 

recorded  by  using  the  following  parameters:  modulation  frequency  100  kHz,  modulation 

amplitude  0.5  mT,  time  constant  0.03  s,  sweep  time  of  4  min  and  temperature  T  =  123  K. 

Experimental  determination  of  the  spin  concentration  in  the  various  TiO2  preparations  was 

obtained by using CuSO4 × 5 H2O (99.999%, CAS Number: 7758-99-8) as S=1/2 standard and 

14 

 
used in powder form, by comparison of the reciprocal double integrated resonance signals divided 

by square root of the applied power.
