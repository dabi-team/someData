ABSTRACT
In our earlier study of this series (Park et al. 2020, Paper I), we examined the
hemispheric sign preference (HSP) of magnetic helicity ﬂux dH/dt across photospheric
surfaces of 4802 samples of 1105 unique active regions (ARs) observed during solar cycle
24. Here, we investigate any association of the HSP, expressed as a degree of compliance,
with ﬂaring activity, analyzing the same set of dH/dt estimates as used in Paper I. The
AR samples under investigation are assigned to heliographic regions (HRs) deﬁned in
the Carrington longitude-latitude plane with a grid spacing of 45◦ in longitude and 15◦
in latitude. For AR samples in each of the deﬁned HRs, we calculate the degree of
HSP compliance and the average soft X-ray ﬂare index. The strongest ﬂaring activity
is found to be in one distinctive HR with an extremely low HSP compliance of 41%
as compared to the mean and standard deviation of 62% and 7%, respectively, over
all HRs. This sole HR shows an anti-HSP (i.e., < 50%) and includes the highly ﬂare-
productive AR NOAA 12673, however this AR is not uniquely responsible for the HR’s
low HSP. We also ﬁnd that all HRs with the highest ﬂaring activity are located in the
southern hemisphere, and they tend to have lower degrees of HSP compliance. These
ﬁndings point to the presence of localized regions of the convection zone with enhanced
turbulence, imparting a greater magnetic complexity and a higher ﬂaring rate to some
rising magnetic ﬂux tubes.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are known as the sudden and rapid release of magnetic energy stored in the so-
lar atmosphere, producing electromagnetic radiation from radio waves to gamma rays. The
vast majority of large ﬂares occur in active regions (ARs) where intense magnetic ﬁelds mani-

fest as dark sunspots in the photosphere. Many studies have been conducted to ﬁnd out sig-
niﬁcant statistical diﬀerences of magnetic ﬁeld properties between ﬂaring and ﬂare-quiet ARs
(e.g., see Zirin & Liggett 1987; Livi et al. 1989; Zhongxian & Jingxiu 1994; LaBonte et al. 2007;
Leka & Barnes 2007; Georgoulis & Rust 2007; Park et al. 2008; Toriumi & Wang 2019, and refer-
ences therein). It is now generally accepted that ﬂares are more likely to occur in ARs with magnetic
ﬁelds exhibiting (1) more complex morphologies (e.g., δ-sunspots), (2) higher degrees of magnetic
non-potentiality in a wide variety of forms (e.g., magnetic twist or shear), and (3) more drastic
changes in the photosphere near magnetic polarity inversion lines (e.g., magnetic ﬂux emergence or
cancellation). Even though these comparison studies have broadly advanced our understanding of
ﬂare-productive ARs, contemporary usage in the context of forecasting solar ﬂares demonstrates that
there are still fundamental aspects yet to be understood (e.g., Barnes et al. 2016; Nishizuka et al.
2017; Leka et al. 2019; Kusano et al. 2020). For example, it is still not clear whether one or many
diﬀerent critical conditions exist for triggering ﬂares and driving eruptive instabilities, not to mention
our continuing quest to understand the physical processes of ﬂare energy build-up and release in the
corona.

Magnetic helicity has received substantial attention over the past few decades, mainly due to its
practical use in quantitatively measuring twists, kinks, and inter-linkages of magnetic ﬁeld lines
within a volume enclosed by a boundary surface S (e.g., Berger & Field 1984; Berger & Prior 2006;
Longcope et al. 2007; D´emoulin & Pariat 2009). Magnetic helicity is gauge invariant only in the case
of a closed volume satisfying that the normal component Bn of the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at every
= 0 at any point on S), on the other hand, a gauge-invariant
point on S. In an open volume (i.e., Bn
form of the so-called relative magnetic helicity was introduced with the choice of a reference magnetic
ﬁeld having the same Bn at S. The relative magnetic helicity is deﬁned as subtracting magnetic
helicity of the reference ﬁeld from the total (refer to Berger & Field 1984; Finn & Antonsen 1985).
For notational simplicity, hereafter, we refer to the relative magnetic helicity as magnetic helicity.

Since magnetic helicity ﬂux dH/dt across photospheric surfaces of ARs was ﬁrst estimated from
observations of the solar magnetic ﬁeld (e.g, Chae 2001), there have been many attempts to investigate
dH/dt in the context of understanding the energy build-up process and initiation mechanism of ﬂares.
For example, Park et al. (2010) examined the temporal variation of dH/dt over 24 hr for each of 378
unique ARs observed during solar cycle 23. They found a tendency that ARs with larger values of
are more ﬂare-productive. Meanwhile, temporal variations of dH/dt over diﬀerent timescales
dH/dt
|
|
of a few hours to days before ﬂare occurrence have been also investigated; consequently, some ﬂare-
associated variations of dH/dt were found, including a large increase or sign reversal of dH/dt (e.g.,
Park et al. 2008; Romano et al. 2014; Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017). It should be noted, however,
that all these studies were carried out based on estimates of dH/dt for a set of individual ARs.
However, so far, no studies have tackled the question of whether the level of ﬂaring activity has any
association with the distribution of dH/dt for a group of ARs located at the same region arbitrarily
deﬁned in the Carrington longitude-latitude heliographic plane.

In our earlier study of this series (Park et al. 2020, Paper I), we explored the well-known hemispheric
sign preference (hereafter referred to as HSP) of magnetic helicity:
i.e., a dominance of negative
(left-handed) helicity in the northern hemisphere and positive (right-handed) helicity in the southern
hemisphere, independent of the solar cycle. More speciﬁcally, we examined the HSP, expressed as a
degree of compliance that ARs follow the expected preference, analyzing dH/dt across photospheric

surfaces of ARs observed from 2010 to 2017 of solar cycle 24 by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). In
Paper I, the HSP of dH/dt was found to be stronger in the case of ARs that (1) appear at higher
dH/dt
latitudes during the rising phase of the solar cycle; (2) have larger values of

AR surface, where vx, vy and vz are all three components of the photospheric magnetized plasma
velocity derived from HMI vector magnetograms with the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator
for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008). These observed HSP dependencies suggest
that the Coriolis force acting on a rising and expanding ﬂux tube in the convection zone may play
an important role in enhancing the HSP. Moreover, the HSP for ARs at higher latitudes may be
strengthened by the diﬀerential rotation on the solar surface as well as the tachocline α-eﬀect of a
ﬂux-transport dynamo. With the same set of dH/dt estimates as used in Paper I, here we study
whether there is any relation between the HSP of dH/dt and ﬂaring activity. The dH/dt data set is
described in Section 2.1, the association of ﬂares with their source ARs is presented in Section 2.2,
and analysis results in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, we summarize and discuss our main ﬁndings.

vector magnetograms acquired from HMI AR Patches (HARPs; Hoeksema et al. 2014, as recorded
in the hmi.M 720s series), and observed daily at 00:36 and 00:48 TAI over an 8 yr period from 2010
May 1 to 2017 December 3, satisfying the following criteria: (1) the longitudinal boundaries of the

contains only a single NOAA-numbered AR with at least one sunspot visible in white-light. Details
of HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld data and methods used to obtain dH/dt estimates as well as their
uncertainties can be found in Paper I and references therein. We note that the results in Section 3
are only minimally aﬀected by the uncertainties in dH/dt, because the uncertainties were found to
be insuﬃcient to cause the misidentiﬁcation of the sign of dH/dt, as discussed in detail in Paper I.
For all of the AR samples, we ﬁnd that 28%, 57%, and 15% are α-class, β-class, and the other
complex-class ARs, respectively, according to their Mount Wilson (or Hale) magnetic classiﬁcations
for sunspot groups. It is also found that 63% of 2530 AR samples in the northern hemisphere and
65% of 2272 samples in the southern hemisphere comply with the HSP of dH/dt. These observed
degrees of HSP compliance are within the range reported in previous studies (e.g., Longcope et al.
1998; Pevtsov et al. 2001; Hagino & Sakurai 2005; Zhang 2006; Liu et al. 2014). We refer the reader
to Paper I for the HSP dependencies identiﬁed with respect to various properties of ARs as well as
some relevant physical mechanisms for adherence to the observed HSP.

2.2. Assignment of Flares to the Active Region Samples

The NOAA/Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) provides historical ﬂare event list data
(ftp://ftp.swpc.noaa.gov/pub/warehouse), obtained by the Geostationary Operational Environmen-
tal Satellites (GOES), along with a network of ground-based solar observatories. The SWPC ﬂare
event list contains relevant information, such as ﬂare start times, magnitudes, source regions and
locations, in order to ﬁnd GOES soft X-ray ﬂares that occurred in a given AR within an interval

4

Park et al.

τ = 24 hr following the AR observation time (00:36 TAI). For each of our AR samples, the ﬂare as-
signment is done basically searching for ﬂares within τ , of which source regions are assigned with the
same NOAA region number as the AR sample. In the SWPC list, there are however some ﬂares for
which no information is available on their source regions (i.e., no NOAA region number is given), but
their heliographic locations (i.e., longitudes and latitudes) are available. Among such ﬂares within
τ , those which are located within the derotated HARP ﬁeld of view (FOV) of the given AR sample
at the ﬂare start times are assigned to that AR sample.

To quantify ﬂaring activity of each AR sample under consideration, we deﬁne the 24 hr ﬂare index

(hereafter shortly indicated as Fidx) as

during τ , and
i is the magnitude (i.e., digit multipliers from 1.0 to 9.9) of the j-class ﬂares. Simply
put, Fidx refers to the sum of GOES soft X-ray peak ﬂuxes of all ﬂares assigned to the given AR
during τ , and it is often considered to measure ﬂare productivity of an AR for a target interval (e.g.,
Abramenko 2005; Park et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2018).

2.3. Calculation of the HSP for Deﬁned HRs

We deﬁne heliographic regions (HRs) in the Carrington longitude-latitude plane, each of which
has the longitudinal and latitudinal extents of 45◦ and 15◦, respectively. The AR samples are then
assigned to the deﬁned HRs, based on where the center coordinates of the AR samples are located.
In the case that the AR sample’s HARP FOV spans two or more HRs, the assignment is to that
which includes the largest fraction of the HARP. For each HR, the degree of HSP compliance is then
calculated as the fraction of AR samples that have negative/positive values of dH/dt if the given HR
is located in the northern/southern hemisphere.

3. RESULTS

3.1. HSP versus Anti-HSP Active Region Properties

±

With the given set of our dH/dt estimates, we ﬁrst examine whether the level of ﬂaring activity
i.e., 3007 HSP AR samples with dH/dt
is diﬀerent between two separate groups of AR samples:
estimates following the HSP versus 1795 anti-HSP AR samples with dH/dt estimates against the
HSP. In panel (a) of Figure 1, the relative frequency distribution of Fidx values is shown for the HSP
samples (red curve) and anti-HSP samples (blue curve), respectively, with the mean (vertical line)
and mean
IQR (tilted lines), where IQR is the interquartile range deﬁned as the 75th percentile
minus 25th percentile. We ﬁnd that the mean of Fidx values for the anti-HSP AR samples is larger
than that for the HSP samples. The diﬀerence between them is however not signiﬁcant according
to the two-sided p-value of 0.097 from the Student’s t-test. In each case of the parameters
dH/dt
|
(panel (b)) and Φ (panel (c)), the mean value for the HSP samples is found to be similar to that for
the anti-HSP samples in the context that: (1) p-value is much larger than 0.1, and (2) the mean value
for the HSP samples is well constrained within the range of the mean
IQR for the anti-HSP
samples, and vice versa. Meanwhile, as shown in panel (d) of Figure 1, the anti-HSP samples have

IQR for either the HSP samples or the anti-HSP
samples.

Flares are known to occur more frequently in ARs that include complex magnetic ﬁelds, such
as δ-sunspots (e.g., Zirin & Liggett 1987; Livi et al. 1989; Zhongxian & Jingxiu 1994; Sammis et al.
2000; Lee et al. 2012).
In this respect, we investigate what percentage of the HSP and anti-HSP
AR samples, respectively, belong to δ-class, and whether there is a notable diﬀerence of the δ-class
1.8% of the HSP AR samples are found to
percentages between the two AR groups. We ﬁnd 4.9

2.3%. The error
in each δ-class percentage is estimated by the Poisson uncertainty of 1/√N , where N is the total
number of the given samples. We ﬁnd that the δ-class percentage shows no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the two groups, even though the mean of Fidx is slightly larger for the anti-HSP samples
compared to the HSP samples.

3.2. Association of the HSP with Flaring Activity in Heliographic Regions

Here, we aim to ﬁnd any association of the HSP with ﬂaring activity in the HRs deﬁned in Sec-
tion 2.3. In Figure 2, each of the deﬁned HRs is color-coded by the degree of HSP compliance for the
subset of our AR samples contained therein. The number of AR samples located within a given HR
is indicated by the side length of the color-coded square in that HR. In this HSP diagram, higher

that this HR is the only one that deﬁnitively shows an anti-HSP (i.e., less than 50% compliance).

Figure 3 shows the average Fidx values for the same subset of AR samples assigned to each of the
HRs as in Figure 2. We ﬁnd that the anti-HSP HR with the remarkably low HSP compliance shows
the strongest ﬂaring activity, having the largest value of the average Fidx = 22. This is extremely
large relative to the mean and standard deviation (i.e., 3.8 and 4.3, respectively) of the average
Fidx values for all HRs. This anti-HSP HR contains the highly ﬂare-productive AR NOAA 12673.
However, even when NOAA 12673 is excluded, this HR still shows an anti-HSP with the lowest HSP
compliance of 44% as well as a high level of ﬂaring activity with the average Fidx = 6 ranked in the
top three. Another large ﬂare-productive HR with the average Fidx = 15, including the largest AR
15◦, 0◦] in
NOAA 12192 observed in cycle 24, is found at [45◦, 90◦] in Carrington longitude and [
latitude. This region has a low HSP compliance of 56% that is smaller than the mean minus one
standard deviation. In addition, as shown in Figure 4, those two speciﬁc HRs have the average Φ
values ranked in the top two (i.e., greater than 1.9

Now we turn to the question of whether there are any general trends or strong correlations between
the degree of HSP compliance, the average Fidx, and the average Φ derived from the AR samples

contained in the deﬁned HRs. As shown in the scatter plot of the average Fidx versus the HSP (panel
(a) of Figure 5), we ﬁnd a weak tendency that HRs with lower degrees of HSP compliance show
larger values of the average Fidx, with the linear Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (PCC) of
0.55. In
the scatter plot, the anti-HSP region with the largest average Fidx can be considered as an extreme
case, which lies far away from both the vertical and horizontal dashes lines used to separate data
points of the ﬁve lowest HSP and the ﬁve largest average Fidx, respectively. On the other hand, a
positive correlation exists between the average Φ and the average Fidx with the linear PCC = 0.65
(refer to panel (b) of Figure 5). Such correlation of Φ with ﬂaring activity in “individual” ARs has
been reported in many previous studies (e.g., Leka & Barnes 2003, 2007; Park et al. 2010; Liu et al.
2017; Lee et al. 2018), but it is reported here for the ﬁrst time on this larger spatial scale of the HRs
over a much longer period of solar cycle 24. As shown in Figure 5(c), a negative, although weak,
correlation appears between the HSP and the average Φ with the linear PCC =
0.36. In contrast, a
weak trend was reported in Paper I that ARs with larger values of Φ show a higher HSP. These two
contrasting trends of the HSP with the average Φ are mainly due to the diﬀerent ways of dividing
the same AR samples into smaller subsets. The AR subsets in this study were selected based on
heliographic locations of the AR samples in the deﬁned Carrington longitude-latitude plane, while
those in Paper I as a function of Φ values. The two highest ﬂare-productive HRs with the average
Fidx
15 have the average Φ values ranked in the top two as well as lower degrees of HSP compliance
(i.e., one with the lowest HSP and the other with the HSP in the bottom 20%). Meanwhile, the
two highly ﬂare-productive regions can be considered as obvious outliers, compared to the positive
trend of the HSP with respect to the average Φ in Paper I. This may indicate that the HSP for those
regions is obscured by vigorous turbulent convective ﬂows interacting with rising ﬂux tubes therein.
As mentioned earlier, the two X-class ﬂaring ARs, NOAA 12673 and NOAA 12192, are located at
the two HRs, respectively. Even excluding these two inﬂuential ARs, however, all of the trends as
described in Figure 5 remain the same, although the correlations become less strong (i.e., the linear
PCCs of

0.27 for the cases in panels (a), (b) and (c) of Figure 5).

3.3. North-south Asymmetry of the HSP

We explore the north-south hemispheric asymmetry of solar activity during solar cycle 24. The
north-south asymmetry has been studied with respect to various solar activity indices for cycle
24, including the total number of ﬂares for a given GOES class (e.g., Bruevich & Yakunina 2017;
Joshi & Chandra 2019), and sunspot areas (e.g., Li et al. 2019). The scatter plots in Figure 5 are
used to examine any notable asymmetry in the distributions of the HSP, the average Φ and the
average Fidx between the HRs in northern (stars) and southern (circles) hemispheres. For the HSP,
as shown in Figure 5(a), we ﬁnd that four out of the ﬁve HRs with the HSP ranked in the bottom
ﬁve (i.e., bottom 15%) are located in the southern hemisphere. A similar north-south asymmetry
is found in the average Φ (see Figure 5(b)), but for the HRs with the ﬁve largest average Φ (i.e.,
top 15%). In the case of the average Fidx, all of the HRs in the top ﬁve are placed in the southern
hemisphere.

−

These observational ﬁndings lend support to the presence of the north-south asymmetric behavior of
solar activity in cycle 24, as discussed above, in which the southern hemisphere is more active overall
than the northern hemisphere. In the present analysis, this asymmetry is most clearly visible with the
activity metrics used here (i.e., the HSP, the average Fidx, and the average Φ) between the HRs lying
15◦, 0◦] versus those lying within [0◦, 15◦] (refer to Figures 2–4). The observed asymmetry in
within [
favor of stronger activity in the southern hemisphere during cycle 24 agrees with other observations
of more frequent ﬂare events at C- or M-class by Joshi & Chandra (2019) as well as larger values of
the yearly mean sunspot area by Li et al. (2019). In addition, the southern hemisphere is expected
to be more active based on the previously reported periodicities of the north-south asymmetry longer
12 cycles shown in Ballester et al. (2005)
than a few solar cycles (e.g., periodic behaviors of
and Li et al. (2002), respectively).

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have investigated the hemispheric sign preference (HSP) of magnetic helicity ﬂux
dH/dt for 4802 samples of 1105 unique active regions (ARs), in the context of whether and how the
HSP is associated with ﬂaring activity of the AR samples observed from 2010 to 2017 of solar cycle
24. The AR samples were ﬁrst categorized into two separate groups of 3007 HSP AR samples with
dH/dt estimates following the HSP and 1795 anti-HSP AR samples with dH/dt estimates against
the HSP. Comparing values of the 24 hr ﬂare index Fidx between the HSP and anti-HSP AR samples,
we found that the mean Fidx for the anti-HSP samples is larger than that for the HSP samples, albeit
with minimal statistical signiﬁcance. Next, heliographic regions (HRs) were deﬁned in the Carrington
longitude-latitude heliographic plane, each of which has the longitudinal and latitudinal extents of
45◦ and 15◦, respectively. We then examined the relations between the degree of HSP compliance,
the average total unsigned ﬂux Φ and the average Fidx for a subset of AR samples placed in each of
the deﬁned HRs. Our main ﬁndings can be summarized as follows:

1. Among the HRs is a distinctive one with the strongest ﬂaring activity that exhibits an extremely
low HSP compliance of 41% as compared to the mean and standard deviation of 62% and 7%,
respectively, for all the regions. This HR includes the highly ﬂare-productive AR NOAA 12673.
Note that even if NOAA 12673 is excluded, the HR still remains an anti-HSP with the lowest
HSP compliance of 44%.

2. There is a weak tendency for HRs with larger values of the average Fidx to have lower degrees
0.55, as well

of HSP compliance with the the linear Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (PCC) of
as larger values of the average Φ with the linear PCC of 0.65.

−

3. All HRs whose average Fidx values rank in the top 15% are located in the southern hemisphere.
Such hemispheric asymmetry is also found in favor of lower degrees of HSP compliance as well
as larger values of the average Φ in the southern hemisphere.

In summary, all these observational ﬁndings lend support to the general trend of stronger ﬂaring
activity in a given HR with a lower degree of HSP compliance during cycle 24. We now attempt
to tackle the question of why there may exist such association of the HSP with ﬂaring activity.
LaBonte et al. (2007) compared dH/dt estimates between 48 X-class ﬂaring ARs and 345 ARs without
X-class ﬂares. Separating the components of dH/dt into the one dH/dtrot by the diﬀerential rotation
on the solar surface and the rest dH/dtrest, they found that on average, the X-class ﬂaring ARs have
5:1 for the ARs that did not produce
a larger ratio of
∼
any X-class ﬂares. They also showed that dH/dtrest can be more disorganized and of opposite sign
compared to the HSP, so that the HSP is eﬀectively obscured by dH/dtrest.

These results suggest that the surface diﬀerential rotation is less likely to be a crucial mecha-
nism to cause the observed X-class ﬂares, but the other components contributing to dH/dt, such
as an emerging twisted magnetic ﬂux tube across the photosphere, may be more related to ﬂare
energy build-up and triggering mechanisms.
In this respect, it is noteworthy to consider the “Σ-
eﬀect” (Longcope et al. 1998), which acts on a buoyantly rising and expanding ﬂux tube through
the turbulent convection zone. Through numerical simulations of the Σ-eﬀect on rising ﬂux tubes,
Longcope et al. (1998) found that a lower degree of HSP compliance can be obtained mainly due
to the interaction of a ﬂux tube with increased magnitudes of turbulent velocities in the convection
zone. Based on the Σ-eﬀect simulations, we conjecture that the distinctive anti-HSP heliographic
region found in the present study may have highly turbulent localized ﬂows through its layers from
the deep convection zone to the photosphere. Such localized, ampliﬁed turbulence in the convection
zone may play a crucial role for rising ﬂux tubes as their magnetic ﬁelds get more complex with
larger magnetic non-potentiality, and eventually produce large ﬂares.

As shown in Figure 5(c), the inverse correlation between the HSP and the average Φ may also sup-
port the conjecture that the expected high-HSP for a rapidly expanding ﬂux tube (with large magnetic
ﬂux) therein by the Coriolis force would be obscured by highly turbulent convective ﬂows in such
low-HSP HRs. Moreover, a number of numerical simulations showed that ARs with complex mag-
netic structures (e.g., γ- or δ-class) are formed by multiple buoyantly emerging segments of a single
subsurface ﬂux tube (e.g., Toriumi et al. 2014; Fang & Fan 2015; Toriumi & Takasao 2017), conﬁrm-
ing prior observational studies (e.g., Leka et al. 1996; Chintzoglou & Zhang 2013). Such multiple
buoyant segments of a single subsurface ﬂux tube may be produced by intense turbulence of localized
regions in the convection zone. Meanwhile, examining Carrington longitudes of recurrent magnetic
ﬂux emergence for several solar rotations (called “long-lived activity complexes”), Komm & Gosain
(2015) revealed that each such activity complex typically has a mixture of positive and negative
current helicity over its lifetime. In these activity complexes, newly emerging magnetic ﬂux interacts
with pre-existing ﬂux of prior ARs, which may cause an increase in magnetic ﬁeld complexity and
lead to ﬂares at an enhanced rate.

The observational ﬁndings in this study reveal that there are regional diﬀerences of HSP com-
pliance in relation to ﬂaring activity during solar cycle 24. Similarly, localized enhancements in
various types of solar activity over long-term intervals of a few years to several solar cycles were
reported in earlier studies: e.g., active longitudes of sunspots (Bogart 1982; Gaizauskas et al. 1983;
Berdyugina & Usoskin 2003; Mandal et al. 2017), preferred longitudinal domains of ﬂares (also known
as hot spots; Bai 1988, 1990, 2003; Gyenge et al. 2016), coronal mass ejections (Gyenge et al. 2017)
and kinetic helicity (Komm & Gosain 2019). Future studies on the solar dynamo as it operates in the
convection zone on the global scale should explore how such localized variations can be generated,
in particular, with respect to the observed non-homogeneity of HSP compliance over the HRs when
a solar cycle is considered. We also expect that the results found in this study can be examined
in detail with numerical simulations of magnetic ﬂux emergence through the layers from the deep
convection zone to the photosphere (e.g., Toriumi & Hotta 2019; Hotta & Toriumi 2020). This will
enlighten our understanding of ARs which may be born to produce ﬂares even before their emer-
gence on the surface, but at the time of their earlier formation in the shape of a twisted magnetic
ﬂux tube in the deep convection zone or during the rise of the ﬂux tube through the convection zone
interacting with both large-scale systematic ﬂows (e.g., diﬀerential rotation, meridional circulation)
and localized turbulent ﬂows.
