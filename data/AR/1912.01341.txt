There has long been a discrepancy between the size distributions of Ar+

n clusters measured by
diﬀerent groups regarding whether or not magic numbers appear at sizes corresponding to the closure
of icosahedral (sub-)shells. We show that the previously observed magic cluster size distributions
are likely the result of an unresolved ArnH+ component, that is, from protonated argon clusters.
We ﬁnd that the proton impurity gives cluster geometries that are much closer to those for neutral
rare gas clusters, which are known to form icosahedral structures, than the pure cationic clusters,
explaining why the mass spectra from protonated argon clusters better matches these structural
models. Our results thus show that even small impurities, e.g. a single proton, can signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the properties of clusters.

Rare gas clusters are some of the simplest chemical
systems studied, with many of their structural properties
deduced from basic sphere packing models [1] or classi-
cal two-body interactions such as the Lennard-Jones 6-12
potential [2, 3]. Theoretical studies have shown that the
global energy minima of such clusters containing less less
than a few hundred particles (with few exceptions [4])
prefer icosahedral geometries where shell closures (and
the ﬁlling of faces on the polyhedra) are associated with
enhanced stabilities [5–7].

It is, alas, diﬃcult to experimentally study the struc-
tures and stabilities of neutral rare-gas clusters [8].
Charged clusters are, however, easily studied using mass
spectrometric techniques. In 1981, Echt et al. reported
that clusters of xenon formed by supersonic expansion
and ionized by electron impact showed enhanced abun-
dances at clusters sizes of 13, 19, 23, 25, 55, 71, 81, 87,
101, 135, and 147, which could be explained by sphere
packing in the formation of icosahedral structures [1].
This was followed by numerous studies showing similar
n [11, 12], Ne+
magic cluster size series in He+
n
[13], and Kr+
n [14, 15] clusters.

n [9, 10], Ar+

Early on it was noted that these series of magic cluster
sizes were not always reproducible. This is particularly
true in the case of Ar+
n , where experimental results can be
placed in one of two categories: 1) where increased abun-
dances of Ar+
n clusters with n = 13, 19, 23, 26, 29, 32, 34,
43, 46, 49, 55, 64, 71, 81, and 87 are observed [11, 12],
and 2) where the most strongest anomaly of Ar+
n clus-
ter sizes below n = 81 is a particularly low abundance
of Ar+
20 [15–20], which is considered to be anti-magic.
The reasons for the observed diﬀerences have been de-
bated for more than 30 years, mainly revolving around
how the clusters are formed (e.g. whether the clusters are
born neutral before being ionized, or are grown around a
charged core), and remains poorly understood [21].

In this paper we present high resolution mass spec-
n clusters and proto-

trometry measurements of pure Ar+

≈

nated ArnH+ clusters that can be separated up to cluster
100. We ﬁnd that the pure Ar+
n cluster series
sizes of n
show few abundance anomalies in agreement with results
from Refs. [15–20], while the protonated ArnH+ clusters
show pronounced magic numbers in agreement with the
results on Ar+
n clusters by Harris et al. [11, 12] and neu-
tral Lennard-Jones clusters [5]. We thus come to believe
that the signiﬁcant diﬀerences observed in past studies
of argon clusters is due to contributions from protonated
clusters. This conclusion is further motivated by ab initio
calculations of pure and protonated argon clusters.

We produce the argon clusters in He nanodroplets us-
ing the setup described in detail in Refs. [22–24]. Brieﬂy,
droplets of He containing on average a few million atoms
are formed by the supersonic expansion of compressed
(2.5 MPa) He through a nozzle that is cooled to 9.5 K.
The droplets capture Ar and H2 gas, that is injected in a
pickup chamber, which condense into clusters in the su-
perﬂuid 0.37 K droplets. The droplets are ionized by im-
pact of 76 eV electrons and the positively charged prod-
ucts are analyzed with a reﬂectron time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometer (Tofwerk AG model HTOF). The mass
spectra are calibrated and analyzed using the Isotope-
Fit software [25]. This method of producing rare gas
clusters has been used in the past to study Ar+
n [20] and
Kr+
n [26] clusters, giving results is good agreement with
other techniques [15–19].

In Figure 1 we show an overview spectrum from He
nanodroplets doped with Ar and H2 prior to ionization.
At low masses (below about 400 u/e) we mainly see the
contribution from pure He+
n clusters from larger neutral
droplets that fragment upon ionization. At higher masses
n , ArnH+, and ArnH+
the spectrum is dominated by Ar+
3
clusters that are free of helium. The inset of Figure 1
shows a zoom-in of the mass range covering Ar19X+ and
Ar20X+ systems. With the resolution of the mass spec-
trometer (R
4000) we can clearly separate the individ-
ual cluster series, the relative intensities of which can be

Size distributions of Ar+

n , ArnH+, and ArnH+

3 clus-
ters are shown in Figure 2 from separate measurements
where we have optimized the intensities of each series.
This does not aﬀect the speciﬁc structures in each se-
ries, but can shift the underlying log-normal distributions
that result from the pickup statistics. Vertical dashed
lines in each panel show the magic cluster sizes reported
by Harris et al. [11, 12] for pure Ar+
n clusters and the
most prominent of these features are labeled above the
top panel. The pure Ar+
n series (top panel of Figure 2)
displays a log-normal size distribution with few anoma-
lies. The depleted Ar+
20 channel reported numerous times
in the past [15–20] is clearly visible, as are a few other
anomalies. There is a clear drop-oﬀ in intensity between
Ar+
24, one that has been reported before [20],
as well as what could be interpreted as magic peaks from
Ar+
27. Although small on an absolute scale
due to the underlying cluster size distirbution, there are
also clear abundance anomalies visible for Ar+
81 and Ar+
87,
which match magic numbers previously reported for Ar+
n
[11, 12], Kr+

16 and Ar+

23 and Ar+

n [14], and Xe+

n [1] clusters.

The distribution of protonated Ar clusters (middle
panel of Figure 2) is clearly diﬀerent from that of the
pure argon clusters (top panel). It is immediately clear
that every single magic size identiﬁed by Harris et al.
[11] for pure Ar+
n clusters is associated with an abun-
dance anomaly in our ArnH+ series. In addition to this,

there are several more subtle features that agree between
the two works, such as the particularly low abundance
of Ar50H+ clusters that is followed by a plateau of rel-
atively abundant Ar51H+ through Ar54H+ peaks. The
main standout feature is that we also identify a magic
Ar7H+ peak, which lies below the lower limit of most
Ar+
n mass spectra found in the literature and is rarely
discussed.

In the bottom panel Figure 2 we show a size distribu-
tion of ArnH+
3 clusters. Some anomalies match the magic
sizes seen with ArnH+ clusters (e.g. n = 19, 29, 43, 55)
though most do not.
It is thus clear that the speciﬁc
positions of abundance anomalies, i.e. magic numbers, is
indeed dependent on the types of impurities present in
the argon clusters. For the remainder of this letter we
will mainly focus on the Ar+

n and ArnH+ clusters.

Clusters of the form ArnX+, where X is some impu-
rity atom or molecule, have been studied in the past
[20, 27–30], displaying magic features similar to those
reported for pure Ar+
n clusters. For example, a magic
Ar54N+
2 cluster has been identiﬁed where one of the Ar
atoms in an icosahedral geometry is replaced with a N2
molecule [20]. Protonated argon has also been well stud-
ied for small systems such as the ArH+ dimer [31, 32]
and the linear ArHAr+ system [31, 33]. However, pre-
vious experimental studies on protonated argon clusters
have only investigated small clusters containing less than
10 Ar atoms [27, 30], while theory has covered ArnH+
sizes up to n = 35 [29, 30, 34].

determined in previous theoretical studies of protonated
[29, 30, 34] and cationic [36] argon clusters where sizes
overlap and they readily explain the ﬁrst few magic num-
bers observed in out experiments.

3 or Ar+

3 core in Ar+

The purely cationic clusters (orange squares in Figure
3) on the other hand show a very diﬀerent behavior. We
ﬁnd no step in binding energy after n = 7 and the ﬁrst
local maxima is instead located at n = 14. The reason
for the diﬀerence in this curve compared to the other two
is due to the existence of an Ar+
4 core that these
clusters form around. The linear Ar+
13 is sig-
niﬁcantly contracted compared to other Ar–Ar distances
as seen in Figure 4. This strains the icosahedral geome-
try so that when a fourteenth Ar atom is added it inter-
acts relatively strongly with this core, forming the basis
for the Ar+
4 system that is present in larger cluster sizes
[36]. This elongated charged core means that there are
more possible positions that other the Ar atoms in the
cluster may interact with the charge-center, leading to
competition between diﬀerent cluster geometries so that
there is less preference for a single dominant structure at
small sizes (this could play a role for sizes smaller than
14 as well). This could explain the poorer agreement
between the theory and experiments for the Arn cluster
distribution compared to the other systems. The opti-
mal geometries of the protonated clusters on the other
hand are very similar to the neutral systems, with the
proton slotting in between two Ar atoms without signiﬁ-
cantly altering the distance between them (see Figure 4).
These compact structures are well explained by icosahe-
dral geometries, giving the magic number series that is
observed in the experiments.

The fact that the protonated argon clusters essentially
retain the geometries of the neutral clusters is why the
magic numbers predicted by sphere packing models are

To better understand our experimental results, we have
performed ab initio structure calculations of neutral Arn
clusters, cationic Ar+
n clusters, and protonated ArnH+
clusters for sizes up to n = 21. The calculations were
performed at MP2(Full)/def2-SVPP level using Gaussian
16 [35]. This method was selected based on previous the-
oretical studies [29, 30], test-calculations on the geome-
tries of small cluster sizes, and due to the favorable scal-
ing that allows us to study clusters with up to relatively
large sizes. The evaporation energy for losing a single,
neutral Ar atom as a function of cluster size of these sys-
tems is shown in Figure 3 and the optimized structures of
Ar13, Ar13H+, Ar+
14 in Figure
4. The geometry optimizations were carried out starting
from the structures of neutral Lennard-Jones clusters [5]
and in the case of the pure Ar+
n clusters, geometries from
Ref. [36] were also tested. The atomic coordinates for
the lowest energy structure of each cluster is given in the
supplementary information.

13, Ar14, Ar14H+, and Ar+

In Figure 3 we can see that the curves for Arn clusters
(blue circles) and ArnH+ clusters (green triangles) show
the same main features, i.e. relatively tightly bound sys-
tems with n = 7, 13, 19 followed by weaker systems for
n = 8, 14, 20. The main diﬀerence is that the protonated
clusters are more tightly bound due the presence of the
charge that attracts the surrounding argon atoms to the
ArHAr+ unit that forms the core of the cluster (see Fig-
ure 4). Our calculations agree well with the structure

n
clusters instead behave as packed spheres with a struc-
tural defect (e.g. Ar+
3 ) at their core [19]. However, as the
cluster sizes increase the overall eﬀect of this distortion
on the entire cluster will decrease. This likely the rea-
son why abundance anomalies matching sphere packing
models [1] begin to appear in the Ar+
n mass spectrum
81.

In light of the present results we have re-evaluated data
from previous studies of Kr+
n clusters [26] performed with
the same setup as the current work. While that study did
identify magic cluster sizes [26], we do not ﬁnd any evi-
dence that protonated clusters played a roll in those re-
sults. We suspect this is because for heavier rare gas clus-
ters, the eﬀect the charge has on the core of the clusters
decreases, thus putting less strain on icosahedral packing
of atoms. We thus do not believe that protonation plays
an important role in the the magic series of Kr+
n [14, 15]
and Xe+
n [1] clusters. It does, however, seem likely that
for the lighter rare gases (Ne and He) protonation can
have a strong eﬀect on the geometries of charged clusters.
Test calculations that we have performed on NenH+ clus-
ters show a similar behavior as we see for argon clusters,
i.e. that protonated clusters better match the structures
of neutral clusters. Isotopic mixtures of Ne atoms would
make the experimental distinction between protonated
and pure Ne clusters more diﬃcult (this is not a problem
for the nearly isotopically pure Ar), but we are nonethe-
less currently performing measurements on these systems
with our setup.

We have shown that protonated argon clusters show
very diﬀerent characteristics than pure, cationic argon
clusters. The protonated clusters display magic sizes that
perfectly match the magic cluster series reported by Har-
ris et al. [11, 12] for pure Ar+
n clusters, indicating that
their measurements may have contained an unresolved
contribution from protonated clusters, likely originating
from some impurity (e.g. water) in their setup. This
could thus solve the long standing disagreement between
diﬀerent studies on argon clusters regarding the nature
and origin of abundance anomalies in the mass spectra
[11, 12, 15–20]. It also highlights the dramatic diﬀerences
small impurities can play in the formation and character-
istics of clusters and small nanoparticles, similar to what
has been observed regarding the electronic properties of
small carbon cluster anions and their hydrides [37], and
the role that hydrogen plays in stabilizing metal clusters
[38].
