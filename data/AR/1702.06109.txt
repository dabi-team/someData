Whether turbulence induced anomalous resistivity (AR) can facilitate a fast mag-

netic reconnection in collisionless plasma is a subject of active debate for decades.

Recent space observations suggest that the reconnection rate can be higher than the

Hall-reconnection rate and turbulent dissipation is required.

In this paper, using

particle-in-cell simulations, we present a case study of how AR produced by Bune-

man instability accelerates magnetic reconnection. We ﬁrst show that the AR/drag

produced by Buneman instability in a thin electron current layer 1) can dissipate

magnetic energy stored in the current layer through dissipation of the kinetic energy

of electron beams; 2) The inhomogeneous drag caused by wave couplings sponta-

neously breaks the magnetic ﬁeld lines and causes impulsive fast non-Hall magnetic

reconnection on electron-scales with a mean rate reaching 0.6 VA. We then show

that a Buneman instability driven by intense electron beams around the x-point in

a 3D magnetic reconnection signiﬁcantly enhances the dissipation of the magnetic

energy. Electron-scale magnetic reconnections driven by the inhomogeneous drag

around the x-line enhances the reconnection electric ﬁeld and the in-plane perpendic-

ular magnetic ﬁeld. About 40% of the released magnetic energy is converted into the

electron thermal energy by AR while 50% is converted into the kinetic energy of the

electron beams through the acceleration by the reconnection electric ﬁeld. The en-

hanced magnetic energy dissipation is balanced by a net Poynting ﬂux in-ﬂow. About

10% of the released magnetic energy is brought out by an enhanced Poynting ﬂux

out-ﬂow. These results suggest that AR with suﬃcient intensity and electron-scale

inhomogeneity can signiﬁcantly accelerate magnetic reconnection.

INTRODUCTION

In the Earth’s magnetosphere1–5 and solar and stellar atmospheres6–8, plasma heating

commonly occurs in current sheets of various scales. Diﬀerent types of macro and micro-

instabilities, including both electrostatic(ES) and electromagnetic(EM) instabilities, can be

triggered in the current sheets. Some can lead to the merging and rearranging of oppositely

directed magnetic ﬁeld lines and bursty releasing of magnetic energy – a process known as

magnetic reconnection.

In magnetic reconnections, the breaking of magnetic ﬁeld lines requires the ideal magne-

tohydrodynamics (MHD) frozen-in condition E + U × B = 0 to be broken. In resistive MHD

theory, e.g. the established Sweet-Parker model9, it is the collisional resistivity η that breaks

the frozen-in condition, and the Ohm’s law assumes the well known form E + U × B = ηj.

However, the collisional resistivity of space plasmas is usually too low to facilitate a suﬃ-

ciently fast Sweet-Parker magnetic reconnection to explain the observed magnetic energy

release in solar ﬂares and magnetospheric substorms.

In thin current sheets, ions and electrons decouple and two-ﬂuid eﬀects dominate10,11.

In this case the Ohm’s law is replaced by the generalized Ohm’s law – the ﬁrst moment of

electron Vlasov equation12,13:

where we used Ue × B/c ≡ (Ui − j/ene) × B/c and for simplicity assumed the plasma

being fully ionized hydrogen with ne = ni where ni and ne are ion the electron density

respectively. The Hall term14 is deﬁned as j × B/c. Besides the electron Joule heating

ηje, the generalized Ohm’s law presents more terms that can break the frozen-in condition,
including the gradient of electron pressure Pe and the electron inertia terms (acceleration

∂tUe and convective momentum Ue∇ · Ue). The Hall term increases as the spatial scale
approaches the ion inertial length di = c/ωpi (where ωpi = (cid:112)mi/4πe2ne) but decreases as
the spatial scale decreases to the electron inertial length de = c/ωpe. The Hall term becomes

zero at the x-point and thus it can not break magnetic ﬁeld lines but rather helps to form

an x-point conﬁguration through the Hall ﬁeld10,15,16. The inertia and pressure terms are

important on electron scales12,17–19.

Simulations of laminar driven magnetic reconnection, e.g. the GEM magnetic reconnec-

tion challenge12, show that by including Hall-eﬀect reconnection can become dramatically

2

faster than Sweet-Parker reconnection, and its maximum steady reconnection rate can reach

0.1-0.2 VA, where VA is Alfv´en speed. An interesting observation based on a set of particle-

in-cell (PIC) simulations is that the maximum Hall-reconnection rate seems universal and is

independent of the mechanism that breaks the ﬁeld lines20,21. Observations and laboratory

experiments have discovered the Hall ﬁeld and Hall current associated with fast collision-

less magnetic reconnection10,12, but no direct experimental or observational evidence has

been found to show that the rate is irrelevant to the dissipation mechanism22–25. On the

other hand, observations of solar ﬂares found that magnetic reconnection may commonly be

turbulent as evidenced by the ﬁlamentary structure of magnetic ﬁeld, non-thermal heating

observed in X-ray, and coherent radio emissions that are likely results of electron two-stream

instability26–28. The reconnection rate in solar ﬂares estimated by the variability of mag-

netic ﬂux around magnetic null-points varies in a wide range, from the moderate 0.1 VA

to very fast 0.5-0.6 VA

29 – much higher than the maximum Hall-reconnection rate from

simulations. Note that solar ﬂare magnetic reconnections mostly have strong guide mag-

netic ﬁeld. Experiments30 and simulations31 show that the reconnection rate of guide ﬁeld

reconnection is lower than the anti-parallel reconnection rate. Therefore the discrepancy

between the simulation results and observation is more severe than it appears. New in situ

Magnetospheric Multiscale Science (MMS) observations of magnetopause reconnection pro-

vide the ﬁrst direct evidence that the reconnection rate is higher than the Hall-reconnection

rate and the turbulence induced anomalous resistivity is probably required to explain the

enhanced reconnection rate32. In addition, Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) sug-

gests that anomalous resistivity may be able to facilitate a fast Sweet-Parker-like magnetic

reconnection33,34.

It’s not surprising that the inconsistency exists between observations and numerical sim-

ulations. First, past numerical simulations have focused on a class of driven magnetic

reconnections with a limited parameter space12 which may not be representative of the re-

connections in nature; Second, the simulated reconnections can be aﬀected by initializations

and boundary condition choices and it is unclear how these aﬀect magnetic reconnection

rate and the generation of instabilities and waves on diﬀerent scales35. A recent simulation

carried out by Sitnov et al. shows that an internal instability drives a new reconnection in

the ion diﬀusion region (IDR) with an unreported Hall-ﬁeld pattern36, while a simulation

carried out by Che et al. found that kinetic instabilities driven at the reconnection x-line can

3

signiﬁcantly increase the reconnection rate37. In nature, the ways magnetic reconnection can

be triggered are far more diverse than have been explored in simulations, and the process

can occur on a wide range of scales simultaneously. More importantly, observations of both

magnetospheric magnetic reconnections and solar ﬂares show that magnetic reconnection

are generally impulsive and turbulent22,27,38,39. While the theory of collisional magnetic re-

connection is better established, turbulent magnetic reconnection which involves wave-wave

and wave-particle interactions on a broad range of spatial and time scales is still poorly

understood.

What is known is that the turbulence eﬀects such as anomalous resistivity (AR) and

anomalous viscosity (AV) can dramatically inﬂuence the energy dissipation and convective

momentum transport. Thus the generalized Ohm’s law in Eq. (1) needs to be modiﬁed for

turbulent reconnection37:

where De ≡ −(cid:104)δneδE(cid:105)/(cid:104)ne(cid:105) is the drag, i.e. AR, Ξe ≡ −(cid:104)δpe(δUe − eδA/mec)(cid:105)/e(cid:104)ne(cid:105) is

AV, pe = neUe, and A is the magnetic vector potential. (cid:104)...(cid:105) denotes the ensemble average

of the turbulence properties.

AR40 is induced by ES instabilities, arising from ion-electron drag, and AV41 is induced

by EM instabilities, arising from anomalous momentum transport. Whether AR and AV

can facilitate fast magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma (if so, how it is achieved)

is a fundamental problem in both plasma physics and space physics and is a subject of

debate for nearly half a century34,37,42–53. The problem is particularly diﬃcult because AR

and AV are highly nonlinear processes which take part in the even more complex magnetic

reconnection processes. Diagnosing the role of AR and AV in magnetic reconnection is a

daunting task, and the progress is slow. In observations, since kinetic instabilities generating

AR and AV are dominated by electron dynamics, addressing the problem experimentally

requires resolution of the electron diﬀusion region (EDR). Only recently it becomes possible

to probe such scales with the launch of the MMS.

The analysis of the generalized Ohm’s Law (Eq. 1) using the observational data from the

ﬁrst encounter of a magnetopause reconnection EDR by MMS shows that AR is required to

explain the enhanced magnetic reconnection rate32. On the other hand, many other MMS

observations discovered coherent electrostatic structures and electron heating in reconnection

4

diﬀusion region, implying that ES instabilities are common in reconnections32,54–58. Thus it

is necessary for us to revisit how AR aﬀects the process of magnetic reconnection in the EDR,

and how AR couples with Hall eﬀect to aﬀect the IDR – both are fundamental problems in

plasma physics59.

In this paper, we concentrate on AR induced by Buneman instability in an unsteady

guide-ﬁeld reconnection. Buneman instability is triggered due to the intense electron beams

developed at the x-line in magnetic reconnection and once the electron beam velocity is

larger than the electron thermal velocity40,45,60–63. Recent MMS observations of magneto-

spheric reconnection discovered that Buneman instability can eﬃciently brake the electron

jet at the exhaust of the diﬀusion region54. Electron holes driven by Buneman instability

are often discovered to associate with electron-scale current sheets in reconnections in the

magnetosphere54,56,64–68. Intense thin electron current sheet develops near the x-line in the

EDR has also been discovered for the ﬁrst time by MMS69.

The 3D guide ﬁeld magnetic reconnection simulation ﬁrst published by Che et al. (2011)37

is so far the only study that clearly demonstrates the dramatic enhancement of reconnection

rate by turbulence, because in this particular case turbulence eﬀects can be separated from

Hall-eﬀect by comparing 3D PIC simulations with a 2D benchmark simulation. In this 3D

guide ﬁeld magnetic reconnection simulation, intense electron beam develops at late stage

when the current sheet near the x-line becomes very thin (with width ∼ de) and triggers

a Buneman instability. At the late stage of the reconnection, the nonlinear evolution of

Buneman instability triggers whistler wave turbulence and then induces anomalous viscosity

that maintain the fast reconnection37. Careful analysis of this simulation can enable us to

gain better insights into how turbulence eﬀects accelerate magnetic reconnections.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In § II A we ﬁrst describe the simulations used

in this analysis; then in § II B we present an analysis of Buneman instability induced AR

in a thin current layer, in which we show the inhomogeneous drag can spontaneously break

magnetic ﬁeld lines to produce electron scale magnetic reconnections that are not aﬀected

by the Hall-eﬀect. In § II C we examine the properties of the Buneman instability induced

drag in a 3D force-free magnetic reconnection and show how drag helps to break the ﬁeld

lines, accelerate magnetic reconnection, and dissipate magnetic energy. The conclusions and

a discussion are presented in § III.

II. SIMULATIONS AND ANALYSIS

A. Simulations

Four PIC simulations using the P3D code70 are employed in this analysis, including

simulations of Buneman instability in a thin current layer in 2D and 3D, and magnetic

reconnection also in 2D and 3D.

The initialization of these simulations are similar to or based on previous papers37,51,71.

The diﬀerences between the Buneman and reconnection simulations are 1) the width of the

initial current sheet in the former is of electron inertial length scale de while the latter is of ion

inertial length scale di; and 2) contrary to reconnection simulations, no initial perturbation

is applied in the Buneman instability simulation so that the Buneman instability can develop

well before magnetic reconnection starts spontaneously.

The parameters of 3D Buneman instability are the same as those in the simulation re-

ported previously51. The initial magnetic ﬁeld has a force-free conﬁguration with Bx,0/B0 =

tanh[(y − Ly/2)/w0], where w0 and Ly are the half-width of the initial current sheet and

the simulation box size in y-direction, respectively. The guide magnetic ﬁeld B2

√

z,0 =
26B0. We choose w0 = de in the

g = B2

B2

0 − B2

x,0 is chosen so that the total magnetic ﬁeld |B| ≡

Buneman instability simulations and w0 = 0.5di in the magnetic reconnection simulations.

Simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the x and z directions, and conducting

boundary condition in the y direction. The initial plasma temperature and density are

isotropic and uniform, with Te0 = Ti0 = 0.04miV 2

A0, where VA0 = B0/(4πn0mi)1/2 is the
asymptotic ion Alfv´en speed. A mass ratio mi/me = 100 is used in all simulations. The

force-free condition requires je × B = 0, thus initially jex/jez = Bx/Bz.

The domain of 3D simulation of Buneman instability has dimensions Lx ×Ly ×Lz = 1di ×

1di × 2di with grid number 512 × 512 × 1024. The particle number per cell is 100. The initial

electron drift velocity is vde ∼ 9VA0 ∼ 3vtez,0, which is large enough to trigger electrostatic
Buneman instability. The total simulation time is ωpe,0t = 160 where ωpe,0 ≡ (4πn0e2/me)1/2

is the initial electron plasma frequency. The same initialization is used in the corresponding

2D simulation except that only 1 cell is used in the x-direction. The 2D simulation is in the

y-z plane in which the waves of Buneman instability propagate along z and form 2D electron

holes in the y-z plane.

6

The parameters for the 3D magnetic reconnection simulation are the same as those in

the simulation published in a previous paper37. The domain has dimensions Lx × Ly × Lz =

4di × 2di × 8di with grid number 512 × 256 × 1024. The particle number per cell is 20.

The initial temperature is the same as that in the Buneman instability simulation, but the

initial electron drift is vde ∼ 4VA0 ∼ vte,0, much smaller than that in the Buneman instability

simulation, thus the Buneman instability is much weaker in the 3D reconnection simulation.

The total simulation time is Ωi0t = 4, where Ωi0 is the asymptotic ion gyro-frequency and

ωpe,0/Ωi0 = 200. The corresponding 2D reconnection domain is Lx×Ly = 4di×2di. The total

simulation time Ωi0t = 4 is short enough to prevent the inﬂow Vin and outﬂow recirculation
due to Vin << Vout < VA0 and the passing time of the ﬂow is << 4di/VA0 = 4Ω−1
i0 .

The simulation quantities are dimensionless, with magnetic ﬁeld normalized to the asymp-

totic B0, density to the asymptotic n0, and velocity to VA0. The units of time and distance

B. Buneman Instability in a thin current sheet and the Spontaneous Fast

Electron-Scale Magnetic Reconnection

In the 3D simulation of the thin current sheet a Buneman instability is driven along

z (cid:105)1/2 ((cid:104)...(cid:105) denotes the average over
z, which approximates the ensemble average) generated by the Buneman instability reaches

instability in cold plasma. The electric ﬂuctuation (cid:104)δE2

its peak at ωpe,0t ∼ 70 and then decays and saturates at ωpe,0t ∼ 160. As the magnitude

of electric ﬂuctuations become large enough to trap electrons and form electron holes with

electric potential satisfying φ > kTe, the Buneman instability enters the nonlinear stage

and the growth rate decreases due to thermal eﬀects71. The fast adiabatic energy exchange

between the electron holes and the trapped electrons causes rapid phase mixing and heating,

leading to the decay of waves and the de-trapping of electrons until the saturation of the

Buneman turbulence when the electron holes break up71. Previous study51 shows that the

kinetic energy of the current and the associated magnetic energy are dissipated by AR in the

form of drag De. The dissipated kinetic energy is converted into parallel electron heating

7

while the dissipated magnetic energy is converted into perpendicular electron heating. At

the same time, besides the electron holes, an inductive electric ﬁeld is produced due to the

dissipation of magnetic energy.

A natural question is whether AR can break magnetic ﬁeld lines as the magnetic energy

is dissipated. Indeed, after the Buneman instability is triggered at ωpe,0t ∼ 40, electron-scale

magnetic reconnections appear at diﬀerent locations along the mid-plane of the current sheet

in the simulation. Examples of the magnetic ﬁeld lines averaged over z at ωpe,0t =48, 60 are

shown in Fig. 1. Magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the current sheet (cid:104)By(cid:105), which was originally

zero, is generated at x = 0.7di and an x-line is formed at ωpe,0t =60. A clear manifestation

of topological change of the magnetic ﬁelds is shown in the magnetic vector potential (cid:104)Az(cid:105)

with amplitude varying from 0 to -0.5 B0/di (Fig.2, multimedia view). As a result of the

magnetic reconnection, the inductive electric ﬁeld (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) is produced with a value as high as

0.6 VA0B0/c. The corresponding localized intense electric ﬁeld Ez increases to as high as

40E0 and the electron density ﬂuctuations can be as high as δn/n0 ∼ 0.8 in the mid-plane,

creating the observed intense drag (cid:104)δneδEz(cid:105).

A remarkable feature of the electron-scale magnetic reconnection is that contrary to ion-

scale reconnection, contribution from Hall-eﬀect is negligible.

In Hall-reconnections the

Hall eﬀect generates an out-of-plane Hall magnetic ﬁeld10,15. Hall ﬁeld has a quadrupole

structure in anti-parallel reconnections16, and the quadrupole is distorted in guide-ﬁeld

reconnections31,72. Such a quadrupole Hall ﬁeld is clearly absent in the simulation as shown in

the out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld (cid:104)Bz(cid:105) − Bg produced during the Buneman instability (Fig. 1).

What we observe is a very small decrease of Bz caused by the dissipation of jex (<< jez).

Hall eﬀect is produced due to the decoupling of ions and electrons. The reason for the

disappearance of Hall eﬀect is that the electrons are fully demagnetized inside the elec-

tron holes and the wave-electron interactions on electron-scale dominate the dynamics. The

reconnection rate (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) from our simulation is with a value as high as ∼ 0.6 B0VA,0/c at

the peak, much larger than the maximum rate of 0.1 − 0.2B0VA,0/c in anti-parallel Hall-

reconnection simulations12. Note that the maximum rate for Hall-reconnections with guide

ﬁeld is generally lower than the 0.1 − 0.2B0VA,0/c value.

How does the drag produce the electron-scale magnetic reconnection during Buneman

instability? Previously51 we found that when Ξe = 0, the Ohm’s Law (Eq. 2) can be split

ﬂuctuations ne − n0 are shown in the mid-plane x-z of the current sheet.

is the Buneman instability generated coherent electric ﬁeld, (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) is the mean elec-

tric ﬁeld, and Ez = Ewv

z +(cid:104)Ez(cid:105). Buneman instability produces electron holes along z near the
mid-plane of the current sheets. The z-averaged (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) cancels out local eﬀects of the electron

holes since (cid:104)Ewv

z (cid:105) = 0. Eq. (3) establishes the relation between the reconnection rate and the
drag while the average of Eq.(4) along z-direction indicates that the dissipation of kinetic

energy by drag is converted into the parallel electron heating (cid:52)(cid:104)Pezz(cid:105) = (cid:52)(cid:104)meneU 2
ez(cid:105)/2 by
the electron holes71. The inductive electric ﬁeld is related to the magnetic vector potential

by (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) = −∂t(cid:104)Az(cid:105)/c using the Coulomb gauge.

The wave couplings during the Buneman instability form wavepackets and cause the

drag to become non-uniform within the current sheet and such non-uniformity determines

the topology of the magnetic ﬁeld. The spatial scale of wavepacket is determined by the

uncertainty principle δkδx ∼ 2π, where δk and δx are the width of the wave number and

the spatial size of the wave packet respectively. We approximate δx ∼ Vgδt and δt ∼ ω−1
pe ,
where Vg ∼ dω/dt. Using the ω − k relation for Buneman instability, we obtain δk ∼ kf ast,

kf ast is the wave number of the fastest growing mode and satisﬁes kf ast = ωpe/vd. In Fig. 1,

both the reconnection electric ﬁeld and the drag appear “clumpy” in the x-direction and

10

form “wave-packets” with scale ∼ 0.1di = 0.1(cid:112)mi/mede = de for mi/me = 100, close to
the wavelength of Buneman instability. Combining the relation (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) = −∂t(cid:104)Az(cid:105)/c and the

Amp`ere’s law, we obtain the equation for (cid:104)Az(cid:105) around the mid-plane of the current sheet:

where ∂2 ≡ ∂2

than jez. Eq.5 is a standard d’Alembert equation. The near ﬁeld solution is

(7)

The magnetic vector potential is the near ﬁeld solution of d’Alembert equation and the

magnetic ﬁeld is a quasi-static ﬁeld, and its change in the xy plane describes the change of

magnetic ﬁeld topology (cid:104)Bx(cid:105) = −∂y(cid:104)Az(cid:105) and (cid:104)By(cid:105) = −∂x(cid:104)Az(cid:105). Using Eq.(7), we estimate

how the electron-scale magnetic reconnection is determined by the inhomogeneity of the

drag. From Eq.(7) we have γ(cid:104)Az(x)(cid:105)/c ∼ 4πeγ(cid:52)(cid:104)jez(cid:105)/ω2

pe − Dez, where γ ∼ ωpe is the
growth rate of Buneman instability. Then we have (cid:104)Az(x)(cid:105) ∼ 4πe(cid:52)(cid:104)jez(cid:105)de/ωpe − Dezde,

where de is the electron inertial length c/ωpe. Thus (cid:104)By(cid:105) ∼ (4πe(cid:52)(cid:104)jez(cid:105)/ωpe − Dez)de/(cid:52)x,

where (cid:52)x is the spatial scale of inhomogeneity of drag. It is clear that the spatial scale of

the inhomogeneous turbulence drag is an important factor that determines the electron-scale

magnetic reconnection.

It should be noted that the electron-scale magnetic reconnection is not necessary for the

fast dissipation of magnetic energy during Buneman instability. The topology change of the

ﬁeld lines in Buneman instability requires the inhomogeneity of drag. The inhomogeneity is

caused by wave couplings that break the symmetry of magnetic potential. To illustrate this

point, we conduct a 2D Buneman instability simulation in the yz plane so that no electron-

scale magnetic reconnection can develop. Fig. 3 shows the electric ﬁeld Ez at ωpe,0t = 60.

The intense localized bi-polar electric ﬁelds, i.e. electron holes form along the z-direction

and the drag produced by these electron holes can dissipate the kinetic energy and the

associated magnetic energy. At the same time, electron heating is produced in directions

parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The time evolutions of electron kinetic,

magnetic energy and pressure are shown in Fig. 4, which are nearly identical to the evolutions

of these quantities averaged over the x-direction in the 3D Buneman simulation as we found

previously51. It is clear that the inductive electric ﬁeld is produced due to the fast dissipation

of magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 5) whose time evolution is similar to that in the 3D simulation and the

peak dissipation rate is ∼ 0.6B0VA0/c. In Fig. 5, By generated by the Buneman instability

oscillates on spatial scale ∼ 0.1di similar to the wavelength of Buneman turbulence along z
in the 2D simulation. The mean value of (cid:104)By(cid:105) is ∼ 10−6 ∼ 0, this conﬁrms that no electron-

scale magnetic reconnection develops in the 2D simulation. For comparison, the evolution

of By along z at the same time in the 3D Buneman simulation is also shown. By obviously

deviates from zero. Beside the fast oscillations with spatial scale 0.1 di along z caused by the

waves generated by the Buneman instability, a new feature is the long spatial scale variation

caused by the wave-wave coupling of Buneman instability which leads to the nonzero (cid:104)By(cid:105).

The value of (cid:104)By(cid:105) is 0.01 which is consistent with the value shown in Fig 1 for 3D Buneman

12

instability. This diﬀerence clearly demonstrates that By is caused by the inhomogeneity of

the drag.

To summarize, AR has two diﬀerent but connected eﬀects. First, it dissipates the mag-

netic energy and produces a mean inductive electric ﬁeld; Second, the inhomogeneity of

drag causes inhomogeneous magnetic energy dissipation which breaks the local symmetry of

the magnetic ﬁeld potential in the current sheet and leads to electron-scale magnetic recon-

nection. The electron-scale reconnection rate is signiﬁcantly higher than Hall-reconnection

rate. With this newly gained insight of Bumenan instability induced AR, we can look into

the role of AR driven in ion-scale magnetic reconnection.

C. How does Anomalous Resistivity Accelerate Magnetic Reconnection?

Since the Buneman instability grows along the current sheet perpendicular to the recon-

nection plane, the instability cannot develop in 2D reconnection simulations. Comparing

simulations.

our 3D and 2D simulations allows clear demonstration of the eﬀects of turbulence generated

by the Buneman instability. As we have shown previously, in the 3D magnetic reconnection

simulation, turbulence driven by an ES Buneman instability and an EM electron velocity

shear instability makes the magnetic reconnection signiﬁcantly faster than the non-turbulent

2D reconnection37. The Buneman instability produces electron holes in the early stage for

a brief period around Ωi0t ∼ 0.4 (ωpe,0t = 80) and the electron velocity shear instability

starts to widen the current sheet and entails the ﬁlamentary structures at later stage. Close

examination of Fig.4 in Che et al. (2011)37 reveals that before the onset of Buneman insta-

bility, the reconnection electric ﬁeld (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) at the x-line (reconnection is in the xy plane) is

fully supported by the electron inertia. As the Buneman instability is triggered at Ωi0t = 3

(ωpe,0t = 600) when the electron drift is about 6VA0 ∼ 2vte, the increasing drag reduces the

electron acceleration, and eventually the drag becomes comparable to the electron inertia

at Ωi0t = 3.2 (ωpe,0t = 640) and lasts to Ωi0t = 3.4 (ωpe,0t = 680). During this period the

Buneman instability becomes saturated. Then the Buneman instability starts to decay while

the electron velocity shear instability starts to grow and surpasses the Buneman instability

at Ωi0t ∼ 3.8. Then the induced whistler wave turbulence becomes dominant. After that

the repeating occurrences of electron velocity shear instability continuously maintain the

fast reconnection.

To understand how drag/AR accelerate magnetic reconnection, we need to answer two

separate questions: 1) How does the drag break magnetic ﬁeld lines around the x-point?

and 2) can the drag aﬀect the dynamics in the IDR?

In the preceding sections we have shown that AR can dissipate magnetic energy, produce

inductive electric ﬁeld and break magnetic ﬁeld lines by its inhomogeneity in electron-scale

thin current sheet. Here we show that the ﬁeld-lines are also broken due to the inhomogeneity

of the drag in the vicinity of the x-line to accelerate magnetic reconnection.

In Fig. 6 we show the electron velocity Vez in the 2D reconnection simulation and (cid:104)Vez(cid:105)

triggered, and at Ωi0t = 3.2 (ωpe,0t = 640) when it reaches its saturation. The saturation

lasts to Ωi0t = 3.4 (ωpe,0t = 680) when the drag becomes comparable to the inertia as we
have shown previously37. The electron velocity Vez peaks around the x-point and exceeds the

threshold vte, triggering Buneman instability. As a result, intensive drag is produced in the

thin current layer around the x-point. We show the drag Dez at Ωi0t = 3, 3.2 in the xy plane

in Fig. 6. Clearly the drag is spatially clumpy. While the drag is produced by Buneman

instability at the vicinity of the x-point, the plasma outﬂow brings the inhomogeneous drag

away from the x-point into the IDR, as illustrated by the expansion of the turbulent current

sheet in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the AR induced dissipation reduces the acceleration

of electron beams, but the electron beams are still continuously accelerated by the enhanced

reconnection electric ﬁeld and maintain the continuous growth of Buneman instability. Both

the width and length of the current layer in the reconnection plane are larger in the 3D than

in the 2D simulation, implying that the plasma heating produced by AR (drag) could play

a similar role as collisional resistivity.

As the drag breaks the ﬁeld lines at the x-point, the non-zero By with opposite sign at the

two sides of the x-point is produced, causing the null-point to shift in a stochastic manner in

the 3D magnetic reconnection. In Fig.7, we show Ez at Ωi0t = 3.2 in the yz plane at x = di,

i.e. the location of the x-point in the non-turbulent 2D reconnection. Bi-polar localized

intense electric ﬁelds or electron holes form along z due to the Buneman instability near the

x-point. In the bottom panel, we show By(z) at the ﬁducial 2D x-point at times of Ωi0t = 2.5

(blue line) prior to the onset of the Buneman instability, and Ωi0t = 3.2(black line) when

the Buneman instability is near the peak. Large deviation of By from zero is similar to

By produced in the 3D Buneman instability simulation shown in Fig.5. The deviation of

By from zero averaged over z is about 0.01 at Ωi0t = 3.2 while the mean value of By is

approximately zero at Ωi0t = 2.5. This stochastic shift of the x-point causes the EDR to

become broader.

We further examine how the Buneman instability enhances the reconnection electric ﬁeld

(cid:104)Ez(cid:105). Fig. 8 shows (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) in the xy plane at Ωit = 3.2 (ωpe,0t = 640) in both the 3D and 2D

simulations. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found: 1) The reconnection electric ﬁeld in the 3D

simulation is concentrated in a region centered at the x-point and extends in the x-direction.

On the other hand the reconnection electric ﬁeld is more diﬀused in the 2D simulation,

simulation.

indicating that in 3D the reconnection rate is much higher in the vicinity of the x-point as

well as in the outﬂow where the drag is carried out than in regions where AR is small. Away

from the x-point the electric ﬁeld is similar to the mean ﬁeld in the 2D simulation; 2) In the

3D simulation, the proﬁle of (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) at the x-point resembles a “wavepacket”. The spatial scale

∼ 0.1 − 0.2di is consistent with the Buneman “wavepackets” in the current sheet simulation

(c.f. Fig. 1) — implying that the reconnection is mediated by the inhomogeneity of the drag

in the thin current sheet, and electron-scale magnetic reconnections occur around the x-line.

An important feature of the electron-scale magnetic reconnection is the enhancement of

(cid:104)By(cid:105) by the inhomogeneous drag (Fig.6). We show (cid:104)By(cid:105) at Ωi0t = 3.2 in both 2D and 3D

magnetic reconnections in Fig. 9. (cid:104)By(cid:105) is increased by ∼ 0.01 in the area extending from the

EDR to the IDR where B2D

current density in guide ﬁeld magnetic reconnection19,30.

It can be shown that the enhancement of By (denoted as (cid:104)Bbun

reconnection electric ﬁeld and the variation along x is small as seen in the simulation. On

the other hand, the time for the plasma outﬂow to travel to the IDR is much shorter than

the electron hole decay time, thus the drag is carried along with the outﬂow into the IDR.

We now look at how the AR generated dissipation aﬀect the magnetic reconnection. In

Fig.10, we study the Poynting equation ∂w/∂t + ∇ · S + je · E = 0, where w = B2/4π

is the magnetic energy density. We consider the electromagnetic energy changes over the
time from Ωi0t = 3 to Ωi0t = 3.2 ((cid:52)t = 0.2Ω−1

i0 ), the period when the Buneman instability
grows to saturation. Since jezEz contributes most to the heating je · E, we neglect the x

and y components. We can see that j2D

the 2D and 3D reconnection are roughly the same, meaning the same amount of magnetic

ﬂowing into the EDR in the 3D reconnection. Obviously the Buneman instability at the

examine the divergence of Poynting ﬂux. Consistent with what we see in the 2D simulation

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we explore how Buneman instability induced AR/drag at the x-line ac-

celerates 3D guide-ﬁeld magnetic reconnection. With a 3D PIC simulation of Buneman

instability in an electron scale current sheet we show that 1) drag Dez can dissipate mag-

netic energy stored in the current layer jez through the dissipation of the kinetic energy of
electron beams. This process is described by the Ohm’s law (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) = − me

e ∂t(cid:104)jez/ne(cid:105) + Dez; 2)
the coupling of waves leads to the formation of wavepackets, causing the drag Dez to become

inhomogeneous along x. As a result, the inductive electric ﬁeld (cid:104)Ez(cid:105) is also a spatial function,

which in turn leads to fast impulsive electron-scale magnetic reconnections as the inhomoge-

neous drag breaks the symmetry of the magnetic potential through −∂t(cid:104)Az(cid:105)/c = (cid:104)Ez(cid:105), and

generates the perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld (cid:104)Bbun

y

(cid:105) = −∂x(cid:104)Az(cid:105).

The electron-scale magnetic reconnection caused by AR is not aﬀected by Hall-eﬀect.

The reconnection rate can reach as high as 0.6 B0VA0/c, and such a high rate has not

been seen previously in simulations. The electron-scale magnetic reconnection however does

not alter the overall energy conversion rates between kinetic, thermal and magnetic energy

in the current sheet, as shown in a comparison between 2D and 3D Buneman instability

simulations.

In ion-scale reconnection simulations, we demonstrate how AR aﬀects magnetic recon-

nection. We were able to separate the eﬀects of AR from other non-turbulent eﬀects that

accelerate magnetic reconnection by comparing the full 3D reconnection simulation with a

benchmark 2D simulation in which Buneman instability does not develop. It should be noted

that in the 3D ion-scale reconnection simulation, the Buneman instability developed at the

x-line is weaker than that in the electron-scale current sheet simulation. This is because 1)

the initial electron drift in reconnection simulation is 4VA0 and the instability is triggered as

21

the drift increased to 6 VA0 ∼ 2vte, much smaller than the initial electron drift 9VA0 ∼ 3vte

in the current sheet simulation; 2) while the velocity of electron beams eventually reaches

9 VA0 at later times of the simulation, the parallel electron thermal velocity also increases

to 5 VA0 due to the electron heating produced by the Buneman instability. As a result the

electron holes and the inductive electric ﬁeld produced in the 3D reconnection simulation

are all much weaker than that in the Buneman instability simulation even though the 3D

magnetic reconnection is still much faster than the corresponding 2D magnetic reconnection.

With these simulations, we have found the following: 1) The drag signiﬁcantly increase the

reconnection electric ﬁeld at the x-point and in the reconnection out-ﬂow region extending

to the IDR; 2) The inhomogeneity of the drag can break the magnetic ﬁeld lines to produce

electron-scale magnetic reconnections at the x-line; 3) The drag can be brought out by

the reconnection out-ﬂow into the IDR, thus increases the size of the EDR; 4) The drag

also increases the size of the EDR by stochastic shifts of the x-point; 5) The enhanced

perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld By is increased by an average of ∼ 25% in our simulation;

and 6) About 40% of the released magnetic energy is converted into the electron thermal

energy by AR while 50% is converted into the kinetic energy of the electron beams through

the acceleration by reconnection electric ﬁeld. The enhanced magnetic energy dissipation

is supported by a net Poynting ﬂux in-ﬂow. About 10% of the released magnetic energy is

brought out by the enhanced Poynting ﬂux out-ﬂow.

We have shown that Bbun

y

is related to the drag by Bbun

spatial scale of inhomogeneity of drag. Therefore only small (cid:52)x can lead to large Bbun

y ∼ Dezde/(cid:52)x, where (cid:52)x is the
(in

y

our case (cid:52)x ∼ de) — implying perhaps only drag with electron scale inhomogeneity has the

potential to signiﬁcantly accelerate magnetic reconnection, probably faster than the Hall

reconnection rate of 0.1 VA. This may explain why some PIC reconnection simulations with

electron holes developed do not show one-to-one correspondence between reconnection rate

and energy conversion73–75.

A group of electron beam instabilities commonly known as streaming instabilities which

include Buneman instability, electron two-stream instability60 and lower hybrid instability62

etc, can all develop around the x-line and in the separatrix as the reconnection current sheets

proceed to the electron inertial length. These electron electrostatic instabilities can form

coherent structures such as electron holes and eﬃciently dissipate both of the kinetic and

magnetic energy via AR. The results presented in this paper serve as a case study which

22

should be useful for more general inquiries into the role of AR in magnetic reconnection.

The results presented in this paper are potentially observable in the magnetosphere. The

MMS time resolution of ∼ ω−1

pe for high frequency waves76 can resolve the waves generated
during the nonlinear phase of the Buneman instability, which lasts for ωpe,0t ∼ 80. Interesting

enough, a spontaneous small-scale fast guide ﬁeld reconnection produced by the twisted

magnetic ﬂux tube may have been observed by MMS77. Streaming instabilities and electron

holes in EDRs of magnetic reconnections are also discovered by MMS32,54–58. With more

observated events, the MMS mission is in a good position to observationally determine the

role of turbulence in magnetic reconnection78,79.
