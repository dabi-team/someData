ABSTRACT. In this study, we first show that the argon flow during epitaxial graphene growth is an important parameter to control 
the quality of the buffer and the graphene layer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) meas-
urements reveal that the decomposition of the SiC substrate strongly depends on the Ar mass flow rate while pressure and temperature 
are kept constant. Our data are interpreted by a model based on the competition of the SiC decomposition rate, controlled by the Ar 
flow, with a uniform graphene buffer layer formation under the equilibrium process at the SiC surface. The proper choice of a set of 
growth parameters allows the growth of defect-free, ultra-smooth and coherent graphene-free buffer layer and bilayer-free monolayer 
graphene sheets which can be transformed into large-area high-quality quasi-freestanding monolayer and bilayer graphene (QFMLG 
and QFBLG) by hydrogen intercalation. AFM, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Raman spectroscopy and electronic transport 
measurements underline the excellent homogeneity of the resulting quasi-freestanding layers. Electronic transport measurements in 
four-point probe configuration reveal a homogeneous low resistance anisotropy on both μm- and mm scales.

INTRODUCTION 
Quasi-freestanding  monolayer  graphene  (QFMLG)  can  be 
fabricated by decoupling of  an epitaxially grown buffer layer 
from the underlying SiC substrate, e.g., via hydrogen intercala-
tion. 1–3 The hydrogen intercalation allows the fabrication of p-
type monolayer graphene combined with the advantage of the 
large-scale graphene epitaxial growth directly on semi-insulat-
ing SiC substrates with reduced influence on the atop graphene 
layer. 4 Hence, this approach offers for potential applications a 
versatile platform as an alternative to epitaxial graphene (EG) 
with n-type charge carriers in the pristine state.  

State-of-the-art QFMLG can be fabricated with high quality 
proven by low defect-related D-peak intensities in local Raman 
measurements  and  high  charge  carrier  mobilities  in  transport 
measurements of micrometer-sized Hall bars.  2,5,6 However, it 
is quite challenging to obtain homogenous QFMLG over mm 
or cm areas, as can be obtained with EG. 7–10 One reason is the 
lower temperature used for buffer layer growth (about 1400 °C, 
~1  bar)  compared  to  graphene  growth  (>  1600  °C,  ~1  bar) 
which limits the carbon supply and surface mass transport and 
thus, the formation of a coherent large-area buffer layer. Such 
problems are often observed at the SiC step-edge region where 
the sublimation rate is strongly enhanced. 11 Moreover, hexag-
onal SiC shows terraces with inequivalent surface energies and 
decomposition  velocities  12,13  which  complicates  the  epitaxial 

growth concerning thickness control and coverage. Due to these 
facts,  either  incomplete  buffer  layer  coverage  (at  low  growth 
temperatures) 9 or additional graphene-layer formation (at ele-
vated growth temperatures)  14,15 are common consequences at 
step edges. Practically, such defected buffer layers prevent a re-
producible  fabrication  of  large-area  homogeneous  QFMLG, 
which is unfavorable regarding electronic device fabrication.  

In this study, we first focus on the influence of mass flow rate 
of argon which is used as an inert atmosphere for the epitaxial 
buffer  layer  and  graphene  growth  processes.  After  that,  we 
show ultra-smooth buffer layer and graphene monolayer fabri-
cated by taking into account the influence of the Ar flow rate as 
well as other growth determining parameters. The high quality 
of the produced samples is further demonstrated after hydrogen 
intercalation.  

Inert gas (N2, Ar, etc.) counter pressure was used for many 
years to improve SiC  sublimation growth which prevents un-
wanted crystal growth before reaching the optimal growth tem-
perature. 16,17 When the Ar counter pressure was introduced to 
epitaxial  graphene  growth  by  SiC  sublimation,  it  led  to  a 
groundbreaking improvement of the homogeneity of epitaxial 
graphene  growth.  4,18  Until  now,  the  Ar  mass  flow  was  not 
considered as an important parameter for graphene growth. Our 
results show, however, that the SiC decomposition rate can be 
controlled via  the  Ar  flow  without varying  total pressure  and 

 
substrate  temperature.  Atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  and 
Raman  spectroscopy  measurements  prove  that  optimized  Ar 
mass flow conditions lead to the formation of highly homoge-
nous buffer or graphene layers, and after intercalation to high-
quality  large-area  QFMLG  and  QFBLG,  respectively.  The 
STM measurements demonstrate freestanding graphene layers 
smoothly bridges over the SiC steps on the adjacent terraces. 
This is further supported by mm-scale Van der Pauw (VdP) as 
well as μm-scale nano-four-point probe (N4PP) measurements 
of millimeter-sized samples with high charge carrier mobilities 
up to 1300 and 3300 (cm2/Vs) for QFMLG and QFBLG at room 
temperature, respectively, at room temperature. The measured 
resistance anisotropy values of 15% for QFMLG and 35% for 
QFBLG are a significant improvement compared to literature.

SAMPLE PREPARATION 
The experiments were performed on the Si-face of the sam-
ples (5 x 10 mm2) cut from a semi-insulating 6H-SiC wafer with 
a nominal miscut of about -0.06° towards [1100] (from II-VI 
Inc.). The substrates were prepared by liquid phase deposition 
of polymer adsorbates on the surface as described for the poly-
mer assisted sublimation growth (PASG) technique in Refs. 7–9 
Epitaxial  growth  was  carried  out  in  a  horizontal  inductively 
heated furnace. 20  

Studying  the  influence  of  Ar  mass  flow  rate  on  the  buffer 
layer growth was conducted on three samples S0, S100, and S1000. 
After vacuum annealing at 900 °C the buffer layer was grown 
at 1400 °C (900 mbar Ar atmosphere, 30 min) under Ar mass 
flow rates of 0, 100 and 1000 sccm, respectively.  

The impact of the Ar mass flow rate on the graphene growth 
was investigated on two samples G0 and G20 grown at 1750 °C 
(Ar atm., 900 mbar, 6 min), under zero and 20 sccm Ar mass 
flow, respectively. All other parameters were kept constant.  

The  optimized  buffer  layer  sample  B0  was  grown  under  0 
sccm Ar flow (900 mbar) by an annealing procedure with tem-
perature steps at 1200 (10 min), 1400 (5 min) and 1500 °C (5 
sec).  

Finally,  we  conducted  hydrogen  intercalation  on  B0  (buffer 
layer) at 900 °C (60 min) to obtain freestanding monolayer gra-
phene  (QFMLG).  Similarly,  quasi-freestanding  bilayer  gra-
phene (QFBLG) was achieved by hydrogen intercalation on G0 
(epi-Graphene) at 1050 °C (2 h). The intercalation was done in 
hydrogen (5%) and argon (95%) gas mixture (1000 mbar). The 
optimal temperature was determined by Raman spectroscopy, 
see supporting information. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Influence  of  Ar  flow  rate  in  epitaxial  buffer  layer/  gra-
phene  growth.  The  surface  morphology  of  the  buffer  layer 
samples grown under different Ar mass flow rates (S0, S100 and 
S1000) are plotted in Figure 1. Figure 1a and b show for sample 
S0 (zero Argon flow) a smooth surface with regular terraces and 
step heights of 0.75 nm. The clear (6√3 × 6√3)R30° spot pro-
file analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED) pat-
tern  in  Figure  1c  indicates  the  formation  of  buffer  layer  gra-
phene which homogenously covers the terraces as shown by the 
even  phase  contrast.  The  homogenous  buffer  layer  growth  is 

attributed to the PASG growth which favors buffer layer nucle-
ation  over  the  entire  terrace.  7,9  The  different  phase  contrasts 
(lighter colors) along the step edges (see inset in Figure 1b) are 
ascribed to two different effects. The bright line originates from 
the local phase shift induced by the topographical difference in 
height.  The  narrow  stripes  of  light  contrast  around  the  step 
edges are attributed to material contrast which could originate 
from uncovered SiC areas or already graphene domains. Since 
graphene growth is rather unlikely at the low growth tempera-
ture  of  1400  °C  9  an  inferior  buffer  layer  growth  at  the  step 
edges is assumed. The missing buffer layer coverage along the 
step edges indicate an insufficient carbon supply in these areas 
which  is  attributed  to  carbon  diffusion  and  preferred  buffer 
layer nucleation on the terraces. These line defects separate the 
buffer layer areas on neighboring terraces, which is unsuitable 
for the fabrication of large-area QFMLG through intercalation. 
The missing buffer layer coverage along the step edges indicate 
an insufficient carbon supply in these areas which is attributed 
to carbon diffusion and preferred buffer layer nucleation on the 
terraces.  

For  higher  100  sccm  Ar  flow  the  surface  morphology 
changes. Although the (6√3 × 6√3) 30° LEED pattern indi-
cates the formation of the buffer layer on the terraces, Figure 1f, 
the AFM images of sample S100 in Figure 1d, and e show that 
the  smooth  terraces  are  interrupted  by  canyon-like  defects 
which erode into the SiC terraces and terminate at the following 
terrace step. These canyon-defects are known to form at gaps in 
the  buffer  layer.  21,22  Here  the  increased  Ar  flow  rate  alters 
locally the thickness and homogeneity of the near surface layer 
of  species  (Knudsen  layer)    23,24  during  the  growth,  where  it 
causes a faster local SiC decomposition and surface mass diffu-
sion, leading to the canyon-defects before a continuous buffer 
layer has formed on the terraces.  

For much higher Ar flows (Figure.1g and h) the accelerated 
SiC decomposition induces an etching of the SiC surface. No 
buffer layer can be formed under these conditions as indicated 
by the (1x1) LEED pattern of the bare SiC surface, Figure 1i. 
The AFM image of S1000 in Figure 1g shows wide terraces and 
pronounced  terrace  broadening  and  step  bunching  with  step 
heights  of  ~2.5  nm.  Nanometer-sized  islands  with  triangular 
shaped  basal  plane  and  heights  about  5.5  nm  are  frequently 
observed  on  the  surface  (see  supporting  information  data).  A 
similar trend of Ar flow dependence was observed for typical 
sublimation growth (SG) without using the PASG technique.7 
(See supporting information)  

Our investigations show that with increasing Ar mass flow the 
SiC surface decomposition is enhanced while the Ar pressure in 
the reactor is kept constant. This can be understood in a model 
in which a quasi-thermal equilibrium exists between Si and C 
species  in  a  surface  layer  and  those  in  the  adjoining  gas 
phase.23,24 For higher Ar flow the species in the gas phase are 
increasingly “blown away” by collision processes with the Ar 
atoms. This perturbation enforces enhanced SiC decomposition 
to maintain the equilibrium. The decomposition process com-
petes with the buffer layer growth since the C-rich surface re-
construction is known to stabilize the SiC surface by the cova-
lent  bonds  in-between.  9,22  The  final  state  of  the  surface  is 
determined by the rates of the involved processes. For zero and 
small Ar flows the slow SiC decomposition is self-limiting by 
the generated carbon for buffer layer growth.

narrow stripes are discontinuities in the buffer layer located around the terrace step edge. The step edge itself appears as a very bright line. 
The dark spots in (d) show canyon defects in the buffer layer on the terraces of sample S100. (j) The step-height profiles, extracted from the 
indicated line in the AFM topography images indicate the giant step bunching under 1000 sccm Ar flow. The LEED images of each sample 
show typical patterns: A (6√3 × 6√3)	) 30° reconstruction for buffer layer on S0 (c) and S100 (f) and a (1 x 1) SiC crystal structure for S1000 
(i), acquired at 140 eV.   

For a high Ar flow, when a fast SiC decomposition rate ex-
ceeds the nucleation and growth rate of the buffer layer, an etch-
ing of the SiC surface is the consequence. Both extreme cases 
are  displayed  by  the  samples  S0  and  S1000,  respectively.  For 
moderate Ar flow both, etching and buffer layer growth can ap-
pear simultaneously but spatially separated as seen for S100. The 
control of the SiC decomposition by the Ar mass flow without 
changing  process  temperature  or  the  Ar  background  pressure 
opens a new parameter range for improved epitaxial graphene 
growth.  

In the following, we demonstrate that the rate of the Ar mass 
flow also has a substantial impact on the surface morphology of 
epitaxial monolayer graphene. We compare exemplary two gra-
phene samples, G0, and G20, which were grown at 1750°C under 
0 and 20 sccm Ar gas flow, respectively. The AFM images for 
both samples (Figure 2a and b) reveal smooth and regular ter-
raced  surfaces  covered  with monolayer graphene (see  Raman 
spectrum in Figure 4e). Under the slightly increased Ar mass 
flow of 20 sccm a homogenous step height of 0.75 nm is ob-
served  (corresponding  to  3  Si-C  layers),  see  cross-section  in 
Figure 2c.

AFM height profiles of both samples, G0 and G20. The lower step 
heights and the step pairs of 0.25/0.5 nm (indicated rectangle) ex-
hibit  a  slower  step  retraction  velocity  for  growth  under  zero  Ar 
flow.

For the higher Ar flow a faster decomposition of the SiC lay-
ers leads to a step height of 0.75 nm corresponding to half of a 
6H-SiC unit cell. The slower SiC decomposition rate of zero Ar 
flow results in gradually retracting SiC layers. The formation of 
the observed step pairs of one and two SiC layers are attributed 
to different retraction velocities of the SiC layers which are re-
lated to the inequivalent surface energy of the specific SiC layer 
sequence of the 6H polytype. 12,13 The retraction process stops 
when large-area buffer layer coverage on the terraces stabilizes 
the SiC surface. Once the SiC surface morphology is stabilized

by the buffer layer, this structure is frozen and remains stable 
even  when  the  temperature  is  further  increased  for  graphene 
growth  to  1750  °C.  Accordingly,  the  SiC  morphology  is  not 
significantly altered in the subsequent graphene formation pro-
cess, which is regarded as the formation of the second buffer 
layer and the detachment and conversion of the first buffer layer 
into monolayer graphene. The high quality of such ultra-smooth 
graphene  layers  was  already  shown  by  Raman  measurements 
and nearly isotropic resistivity. 7–9

Quasi-freestanding  mono/bi-  graphene  layers.  In  the 
following, we focus on the investigation of the coherent high-
quality  buffer  layer  which  can  be  used  for  the  fabrication  of 

large  areas  of  QFMLG.  Moreover,  the  investigation  of  the 
quasi-freestanding graphene layers is a further test for the ho-
mogeneity of the produced buffer layer. To this end, we started

with the growth condition of S0 but with an optimized time and 
annealing protocol as given above. The AFM topography of this 
optimized  buffer  layer  sample  B0  in  Figure  3a  shows    very 
smooth buffer layer with step heights below 0.75 nm (inset in 
Figure 3a) and a repeating pattern of step pairs of 0.25 and 0.5 
nm which indicates a reduced step retraction compared to the 
samples S0 and S100. No canyon defects appear in this sample 
and the corresponding phase image in Figure 3b also shows no 
line  defects  which  indicates  a  continuous  buffer  layer  which 
spans  over  the  terrace  edges.  The  small  step  heights  are  sup-
posed to be additionally beneficial for the linking process of the 
buffer  layer  on  neighboring  terraces.  Although  the  surface  is 
completely covered with the buffer layer, a weak contrast be-
tween both alternating terraces is observed which is attributed 
to the influence of the underlying SiC layers. (to be published)  
The structural homogeneity and lateral coverage of the buffer 
layer  B0  are  further  verified  by  Raman  measurements.  The 
spectrum  of  this  sample  shows  broad  features,  between  1200 
and 1700 cm-1 (upper spectrum in Figure 4a) which are related 

to  the  vibrational  density  of  states  (vDOS)  of  the  (6√3 ×
6√3)R30°   surface reconstruction.  25 The integrated intensity 
area of these broad Raman bands is regarded as a measure for 
lateral coverage in the Raman mapping of the buffer layer, and 
it  is  plotted  in  Figure  4b  for  an  area  scan  of  20  x  20  µm2. 
Additionally, no Raman spectral changes were observed in the 
vDOS bands during the Raman mapping indicating a homoge-
nous distribution of the buffer layer across the investigated area. 
The  nearly  monochrome  green  colored  area  visualizes  that  a 
continuous and homogenous buffer layer has formed. This be-
comes obvious when the Raman map is compared to that of a 
graphene sample which was grown under non-optimized condi-
tions, see supporting information. There, the spatial variation of 
the integrated buffer layer intensity displays a considerable non-
homogenous coverage and the partial lack of the buffer layer. 
The spectra of the Raman mapping show no graphene-typical 
2D peak (at around 2700 cm-1) which clearly indicates the ab-
sence of EG domains on top of the buffer layer.

optimized buffer layer sample (upper spectrum) and the resulting QFMLG (lower spectrum) after hydrogen intercalation. In (b) the 25 µm x 
25 µm map the integrated intensity of the buffer layer Raman band is plotted. In (c) the intensity ratio of D- and G- peak (peak values) and 
in (d) the linewidths (FWHM) of the 2D peak of the QFMLG sample are displayed in areal maps. (e) shows Raman spectra of epitaxial 
monolayer  graphene  and  the  resulting  QFBLG  obtained  after  hydrogen  intercalation.  (f)  The  linewidths  (FWHM)  of  the  2D  line  of  the 
epitaxial graphene layer shows homogenous monolayer graphene without bilayer inclusions. (g) Areal maps of the intensity ratio of D- and

QFMLG was produced by hydrogen intercalation of the opti-
mized buffer layer (B0) and the AFM, LEED, and STM scrutiny 
of the surface are shown in Figure 3c-f. The AFM image in Fig-
ure 3c reveals a homogenous QFMLG layer. The detachment of 
the graphene leads to a smoother surface compared to the pre-
vious buffer layer which showed sharper and more pronounced 

steps in the AFM image (Figure 3a). The large area detachment 
of the buffer layer is proven by the typical LEED pattern (inset 
in  Figure  3d)  of  quasi-freestanding  graphene.1  The  (6√3 ×
6√3)R30° buffer layer pattern has disappeared since the corre-
lation of the buffer layer superstructure to the underlying SiC 

5 

 
 
 
 
surface lattice is lost. Interestingly, the AFM phase image (Fig-
ure 3d) is still showing a slight alternating contrast on the ter-
races  which  reveals  a  continuous  influence  of  the  underlying 
SiC surface terraces on the electronic properties of the QFMLG.  
Additionally, the atomic structure was investigated using an 
Omicron low-temperature STM at 77 K with a tungsten tip. The 
detailed topography of the QFMLG sheet near 0.25 nm high and 
0.5 nm high step edges are displayed by high-resolution STM 
images in Figure 3e. The graphene lattice is clearly seen on both 
the upper and lower terraces. The observation of the hexagonal 
crystal structure (lattice constants of 2.46 Å) proves that the SiC 
in this area is completely covered with graphene and line de-
fects are absent. Furthermore, dislocations and domain bound-
aries are not observed. The 4 x 4 nm2 STM images which were 
taken  across  the  step  edges  reveal  a  coherent  graphene  layer 
which spans smoothly over the step edge from one terrace to the 
other.  A  larger  two-dimensional  image  (see  supporting  infor-
mation) shows the unchanged lattice orientation over the step. 
Our finding is similar to the case of monolayer graphene cov-
ered step. 26,27 This is also very similar to the case of QFMLG 
on the higher step of 0.75 nm which randomly was observed on 
the  surface  of  this  sample,  see  also  supporting  information. 
However, in our QFMLG the warp up (down) of the graphene 
sheet at the upper (lower) terrace as observed for EG 26,27 is not 
formed.  

The appearance of the 2D peak in the Raman spectra of the 
QFMLG  sample  (lower  spectrum  in  Figure  4a)  proves  that 
quasi-freestanding  monolayer  graphene  (QFMLG)  has  been 
produced, in agreement with LEED shown in the inset of Figure 
3d.  The  relaxation  of  the  graphene  layer  is  indicated  by  the 
redshift of the 2D peak position at 2669 ± 2.7 cm-1 compared to 
the 2D peak position at ~2731 ± 1.5 cm-1 of monolayer epitaxial 
SiC/G  van-der-Waals  bonded  to  the  buffer  layer.  From  the 
small full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) value of 27 ± 2.2 
cm-1, a high carrier mobility value is expected. 28 

The  Raman  spectrum  of  the  QFMLG  sample  in  Figure  4a 
(lower spectrum) shows a well pronounced G peak (1587 ± 1.1 
cm-1) with an FWHM of 9.6 ± 1.9 cm-1. A very small D peak at 
~1339 cm-1 in the Raman spectrum of QFMLG can be attributed 
to a small density of remaining defects in the graphene lattice. 
The small ID/IG (peak maxima) ratio of about 0.1 is comparable 
to that of other high-quality graphene samples. 29 From the ID/IG 
ratio a defect density of ndef. = (3.3 ± 0.7) x 1010 cm-2 is esti-
mated.  29,30  This  extraordinarily  high  graphene  quality  was 
found over the entire area of 20 x 20 µm-2 in the mapping of the 
ID/IG (peak values) ratio in Figure 4c. Measurements at different 
positions and on other optimized buffer layer samples suggest a 
similar low defect density over the whole sample surface. The 
origin of the defects is correlated with the SiC crystal imperfec-
tions that induce defects in the buffer layer during growth, as 
well as the intercalation deficiency like partial intercalation or 
etching  which  could  have  reasonably  been  enhanced  by  low 
concentration of the applied hydrogen. 26,27,31  

In Figure 4a and e, the Raman spectra were subtracted from a 
reference Raman spectrum of pure SiC to remove the spectral 
overtones related to SiC. A spectral artifact (wiggles) appear (in 
blue and red spectra) at ~1500 cm-1 and ~1700 cm-1 which is 
due to a slight mismatch between the Raman spectrum of the 
samples and the reference spectrum of SiC.  

The Raman mapping of the FWHM of the 2D peak in Figure 
4d shows predominantly blue marked regions that are related to 
2D peak widths of ~27 cm-1 which give evidence of a very high 
homogeneity  QFMLG.  Bilayer  formation,  in  this  case,  is 
excluded since it would result in much larger FWHM values > 
45  cm-1.  28  The  small  green  colored  areas  show  increased 
FWHM values slightly above 30 cm-1 which could arise from 
low strain variations at nanoscale leading to a superposition of 
slightly different 2D peak positions within the Raman laser spot 
and  thus  exhibiting  an  artificial  broadening  of  the  2D  peak 
width in the acquired Raman spectrum and mapping.  

Also, QFBLG was produced by hydrogen intercalation from 
the optimized monolayer graphene sample (G0). The upper Ra-
man spectrum in Figure 4e shows the typical fingerprint of epi-
taxial graphene, indicating the G peak at 1601 cm-1 and 2D peak 
at 2731 cm-1, whereas broad phonon bands from the buffer layer 
arise in the range of 1200 and 1700 cm-1. Figure 4f shows a ho-
mogenous  distribution of  the 2D peak  width  of  epitaxial  gra-
phene over an area of 20 µm x 20 µm with an averaged 2D peak 
width of (33 ± 1.5 cm-1). After H intercalation (lower spectrum 
in Figure 4e) the broad buffer layer related Raman band around 
the  D  peak  disappears  since  the  detached  buffer  layer  is 
transformed  into  the  second  free-standing  graphene  layer. 
Therefore,  the  2D  peak  becomes  broader  (FWHM  around  59 
cm-1) and asymmetric line shape (see supporting information) 
which indicates the formation of bilayer graphene. The FWHM 
map of the 2D peak in Figure 4h reveals the homogenous dis-
tribution  of  bilayer  graphene.  The  slightly  increased  FWHM 
values  (  yellow  areas)  could  again  be  caused  by  local  strain 
variations.  The  quality  and  homogeneity  of  the  QFBLG  is 
further underlined  by the  low  values  and  even distribution of 
ID/IG  <  0.1  (peak  maxima)  ratios  which  indicate  a  low  defect 
density of about ndef. < 2.0 x 1010 cm-2, see Figure 4g.

Electronic transport characterization. The homogeneity of 
the QFMLG and the QFBLG samples were further investigated 
by rotational four-point probe measurements on the micro scale 
(100 µm STM tip spacing) at room temperature as described in 
Ref.  8,32–34. The angle-dependent resistance of both samples is 
plotted in Figure 5. The lowest resistance values for each sam-
ple are measured for transport parallel to the terraces whereas 
the maximum value is obtained at an angle of about 90° which 

6 

 
 
 
 
corresponds  to  a  current  direction  perpendicular  to  the  step 
edges. 8,34 The calculated anisotropy values (A = ρperp / ρpar) are 
1.2  and  1.42  for  QFMLG  and  QFBLG,  respectively.  Despite 
missing comparative values in the literature these values are re-
garded as a sufficient low anisotropy indicating a good homo-
geneity. However, they are larger compared to optimized ultra-
smooth  epitaxial  monolayer  graphene  with  nearly  unity  isot-
ropy values (A = 1.03). 8 We suppose that the observed anisot-
ropy  could  stem  from  intercalation  related  defects  and  local 
strain variation as for instance observed in the Raman spectrum 
of the QFMLG sample, see Figure 4c. The low concentration of 
the intercalating gas agent (5% hydrogen) could have also in

tensified the defects and result in an inhomogeneous or partial 
intercalation.35,36 

The  microscopic 

anisotropy  measurements  were 
complemented by macroscopic VdP measurements in a helium 
flow  cryostat  in  a  magnetic  field  up  to  500  mT.  For  the 
measurement the samples were first cut into square-shape of 5 
mm x 5 mm, and the graphene on top of the sample was isolated 
from the graphene on the side and the back of the substrate by 
scribing  cut-grooves  on  each  side  close  to  the  edge  of  the 
sample (~ 0.1 mm from the edge), as shown in the schematic of 
the VdP configuration in Figure 6.

Table 1. Results of VdP measurements at 5 mm x 5 mm large samples with QFMLG, epitaxial graphene, and QFBLG.  

Figure 6. Right side: sketch of the VdP configuration. The graphene (green) on top of the sample (5 x 5 mm2) was isolated from 
graphene on sidewalls and backside by cut-grooves close to each edge (indicated as red lines). 

Four  gold  pins  in  square  configuration  were  pressed  firmly 
onto  the  surface  to  contact  the  graphene  at  the  corners.  The 
ohmic  characteristic  and  the  linearity  of  the  Hall  ramps  were 
tested before the measurements. The VdP measurements were 
carried out at room temperature (295 K) and 2.2 K., see Table 
1. As expected both samples, QFMLG and QFBLG, show the 
typical high p-type carrier density of about 6.7 x 1012 and 6.3 x 
1012 cm-2, respectively. 1 For the QFMLG we obtain mobility of 
about 1159 cm2/Vs at room temperature and for n-type epitaxial 
graphene (G0) about 1108 cm2/Vs. However, at 2.2 K the epi-
taxial  graphene  shows  considerably  higher  mobility  of  2459 
cm2/Vs whereas the mobility of QFMLG remained almost con-
stant  at  µ  =  1169  cm2/Vs.  This  is  due  to  different  scattering 
mechanisms in these two types of epitaxial graphene monolay-
ers. While the temperature dependence of mobility in the epi-
taxial graphene (G0) is due to longitudinal acoustic phonons in 
graphene  and  SiC,  the  dominant  scattering  in  QFMLG  is 
attributed to Coulomb scattering induced by charged impurities. 
6,37  Although  higher  values  of  3000  cm2/Vs  were  already 
reported for micrometer-sized QFMLG confined Hall bars on 
the  single  terrace  2,6,14  this  is  still  a  remarkable  result,  for  the 
produced large-size sample. In contrast to QFMLG, the meas-
urements  on  QFBLG  (after 
intercalating  G0)  revealed 
noticeable  higher  mobility  values  of  2696  cm2/Vs  (RT)  and 
3352 cm2/Vs (2.2 K). This temperature dependence of the car-
rier mobility in QFBLG is referred to an interplay of different 
scattering mechanisms, temperature dependent Coulomb scat-

tering and the charge impurity density. Note, that the higher mo-
bility compared to QFMLG could stem from screening of Cou-
lomb scatterers in the substrate and bilayer graphene. 6,38,39  

It  is  worth  mentioning  that  investigation  of  QFMLG  and 
QFBLG was carried out on a considerable number of sample 
sets  showing  much  higher  mobilities  of  1300  cm2/Vs,  2000 
cm2/Vs,  and  3300  cm2/Vs  for  QFMLG,  epi-graphene,  and 
QFBLG,  at  room  temperature,  respectively.  However,  for 
consistency, we present in this work the results of the samples 
with  similar  treatment  and  the  same  growth  and  intercalation 
processes. 

The homogeneity of the samples was derived from the VdP 
sheet  resistances  Rpar  and  Rperp  measured  in  two  orthogonal 
directions, parallel and perpendicular to the step edges. As be-
fore  higher  resistance  values  were  obtained  for  perpendicular 
transport. The QFMLG and QFBLG samples show anisotropy 
values (Rperp / Rpar) values of 1.18 and 1.37 (at room tempera-
ture) which are in very good agreement with the microscopic 
four-point probe measurements. This result indicates the very 
good electronic homogeneity over mm scales of our QFMLG 
and QFBLG samples in excellent agreement with the AFM and 
Raman data. For QFBLG a comparable VdP study 19 revealed a 
much stronger anisotropy of about 200% which was attributed 
to high step edges (~ 10 nm) and multilayer graphene along the 
step edges. The absence of multilayer graphene in our QFMLG 
and QFBLG and the low step heights can thus be regarded as 
highly beneficial for homogeneous electronic properties. This 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
result gives evidence of the high quality of the PASG method 
and the possibility of optimization of the growth parameters.  

CONCLUSION 
In  summary,  we  have  presented  AFM,  STM,  LEED,  elec-
tronic  transport  and  Raman  measurements  which  indicate  the 
strong influence of the argon mass flow rate on the formation 
of the buffer layer and the graphene growth. For a given tem-
perature and constant Ar pressure, the Ar mass flow rate con-
trols  the  SiC  decomposition  rate  which  can  be  qualitatively 
understood  by  thermal  equilibrium  considerations.  This  new 
finding  has  the  potential  to  improve  the  graphene  quality  by 
avoiding accelerated step bunching at higher temperatures and 
graphene roughening for lower Ar pressures, respectively. By 
properly  chosen  growth  parameters  it  is  possible  to  prevent 
structural  defects  (canyon  defects  and  step  defects)  and  to 
obtain  a  continuous,  large-area  buffer  layer  without  graphene 
inclusions.  This  meets  the  demands  of  intercalation  purposes 
and could further be used as a platform for growing other 2D 
materials or metamaterials. The QFMLG and QFBLG produced 
by  hydrogen  intercalation  exhibit  excellent  homogeneity  and 
very  small  resistance  anisotropy  over  areas  in  the  millimeter 
range. This indicates the presence of a coherent layer of free-
standing monolayer graphene over large areas which is a pre-
requisite for application in electronic devices.

1) Influence of argon flux on conventional epitaxial sublimation growth (SG) of buffer layer 

Figure S1 shows the influence of the argon mass flow rate on buffer layer growth on the samples without polymer prepa-

ration that are investigated by AFM and SEM. Three samples Sꞌ0, Sꞌ100, and Sꞌ1000 are 4H-SiC with nominal miscut of about 

-0.06° towards [1100]	and were processed at 1400 °C (1 bar argon atm., for 30 min) at different Ar flow of 0, 100 and 1000 

sccm, respectively. This experiment was carried out under the same conditions as the one in the manuscript and it aims at 

studying the influence of argon flow on samples grown from another SiC polytype (4H-SiC) in the absence of polymer 

preparation. For the high argon flow of 1000 sccm the surface of the sample undergoes severe step bunching without any 

buffer layer growth Figure S1. g, h, i. This is similar to the PASG sample in the manuscript (see Figure 1g, h, and i). In both 

cases the high Ar flow leads to surface etching. For moderate Ar flow, however, the situation is different. The surface of the 

sample without polymer preparation shows stripes of the covered buffer layer and bare SiC, Figure S1. d, e, and f. This is in 

contrast to the PASG sample (manuscript Figure 1, d, e, and f) where the provided carbon species from polymer lead to 

surface super-saturation and well buffer layer coverage although the Ar flow caused canyon-like defects. For the case of 

zero argon flow (Figure S1, a, b, and c) the surface looks very good with homogeneous coverage, while the terraces appear 

less ordered in comparison with the PASG sample (manuscript Figure 1, a, b, and c).

Figure S1. Inspecting the influence of the argon mass flow on graphitization of 4H-SiC(0001) at 1400°C (1bar Ar 
ambient,  30  min)  under  three  different  argon  gas  flows:  a)  Sꞌ0  (Ar/  0  sccm),  b)  Sꞌ100  (Ar/100  sccm),  and  c)  Sꞌ1000 
(Ar/1000 sccm). The sample was grown by typical sublimation growth without polymer preparation. Sꞌ0 processed 
under no Ar flow representing good buffer layer coverage in AFM phase (b) and scanning electron microscopy SEM 
(1kV) (c) images. The moderate flow Ar for S'100 distorts its surface growth causing the formation of buffer layer 
stripes on this sample, as can be seen in AFM phase (e) and SEM (f) images. The intensive argon flux on S'1000 prevents 
buffer layer formation and results in severe step bunching on this sample (g), (h), (i). 

2) Formation of triangle-shape defects  
It is observed that the increase of the Ar flow leads to the formation of triangular-shape structures. This can be seen in 

Figure S1g, h, and i, for the sample processed under 1000 sccm Ar flow. Also, rather increase of the Ar flow escalates the 

density of such structures, as can be seen in Figure S2 for the sample processed at 1400 °C (30 min, 1 bar Ar) in the presence 

of the Ar flow of 2000 sccm. The aggregated mass along the giant steps and the triangular-like structures is the typical

morphology all over the surface of this sample. Although, here the properties of such triangular-shape structures has not 

been further studied, however, they very resemble the cubic SiC grown on other substrates elsewhere. 1,2

6H-SiC sample after annealing at 1400°C (1 bar in Ar ambient, 30 min) under 2000 sccm Ar-flux. The inset shows 
the AFM phase image of the same sample.  

Moreover, such triangle–shape structures might not only appear under intensive gas flow but also under the lower pressure 

conditions in, which leads to condensation and reflection of sublimated species back onto the surface of the substrate. Figure 

S3 shows AFM inspection on the surface of a 6H-SiC sample which processed at 50 mbar (1400 °C, 30 min). The triangle-

bar structures appear to entirely cover the substrate with heights up to 14 nm.   

Figure S3. AFM inspection: (a) morphology (b) phase image. Triangular-shape structures appeared on the surface of 
a sample processed at 1400 °C (30 min), but the pressure was 50 mbar instead of the typical 1 bar of argon. The surface 
shows high condensation of the sublimated species back on the surface of the sample.  

3) Step-by-step transition of the buffer layer to quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene 
Figure S4a shows the Raman spectra of a buffer layer sample after step-by-step hydrogen intercalation 5% (95% argon) 

for 15 minutes at different temperatures ranging from 400 °C up to 1200 °C. The intercalation up to 400 °C does not show 

any significant change in the buffer layer spectra with the typical two-phonon bands in the spectral range between 1390 and 

1605 cm-1.  3 By temperature risse to 500°C despite the slight change in D-peak, yet no 2D-peak is observed, whereas at 

Support-3 

 
 
 
 
  
 
600°C  the  D-peak  sharply  increases  and  the  2D-peak  is  observed,  clearly  indicating  a  transition  from  buffer  layer  to 

graphene.  By  further  increasing  temperature,  the  D-peak  decreases,  which  denotes  disorder  reduction  in  the  crystal  of 

graphene. An even higher temperate leads to a higher 2D-peak, while its position shifts to lower wave numbers. This is a 

result of a tensile strain which may be accompanied with a doping increase.4,5 Moreover, the increase of the temperature 

shows lowering down the defect density of the QFMLG layer as shown for three annealing steps of 600 °C, 800 °C, and 

1000 °C, in Figure S4b, c, and d. 

Figure S4. Temperature dependency of intercalation on buffer layer sample via 5% (95%Ar) hydrogen. At 400°C no 
intercalation occurred, inferred from the Raman spectra (a). For temperature above 400°C, the D-peak starts to in-
crease which is accompanied by the appearance of 2D-peak at 600°C, indicating transition to graphene. By increasing 
the temperature, D-peak decreases and 2D-peak increases demonstrating more effective intercalation and reduction of 
defect density measured by ID/IG (b-d). 

4) Hydrogen intercalation on low-quality buffer layer 
Figure S5 shows the AFM and Raman investigations of a buffer layer sample with poor coverage. The AFM phase images 

(Figure S5b) a color contrast on the abutting terrace, though the origin of the contrast is different from the optimized sample 

in the manuscript (see Figure 3b). The contrast on this sample is a result of interaction between AFM tip with two different 

materials  (buffer  layer  and  SiC  stripes)  directly  at  the  sample  surface,  whereas  the  contrast  on  the  optimized  sample  is 

attributed to the underlying SiC surfaces. The mapping Raman D+G areas in Figure S5d shows an inhomogeneous buffer 

layer. As it was expected, the hydrogen intercalation on such defected buffer layer has led to a highly defected QFMLG as

Mapping of I(D/G) shows an inhomogeneous QFMLG. 

5) Atomic resolution STM measurement on QFMLG 
 Figure S6a shows a two-dimensional STM image captured on QFMLG sample shown in the manuscript (see Figure 3e) 

with a larger size of 15 x 15 nm2. It can be seen that the quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene very smoothly passes over 

the step of 0.25 nm high from one terrace to the neighboring terrace. Figure S6b exhibits the QFMLG nicely covers a higher 

step of 0.75 nm high (1/2 unit-cell of 6H-SiC) which randomly was observed on this sample.

6) 2D-peak spectrum of Quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) 

Figure S7. Raman spectrum of QFBLG shows broadened 2D peak with an FWHM of ~ 59 cm-1 as well as an asymmetrical 

line shape of the 2D peak which can be fitted by four Lorentzian curves.
