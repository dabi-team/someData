Integration of electrical contacts into van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is critical for realizing electronic and
optoelectronic functionalities. However, to date no scalable methodology for gaining electrical access to buried
monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors exists. Here we report viable edge contact formation to hexago-
nal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated monolayer MoS2. By combining reactive ion etching, in-situ Ar
sputtering
and annealing, we achieve a relatively low edge contact resistance, high mobility (up to ∼30 cm2 V−1 s−1) and
high on-current density (>50 µA/µm at V
DS = 3 V), comparable to top contacts. Furthermore, the atomically
smooth hBN environment also preserves the intrinsic MoS2 channel quality during fabrication, leading to a
steep subthreshold swing of 116 mV/dec with a negligible hysteresis. Hence, edge contacts are highly promising
for large-scale practical implementation of encapsulated heterostructure devices, especially those involving air
sensitive materials, and can be arbitrarily narrow, which opens the door to further shrinkage of 2D device footprint.

Two-dimensional electronic devices made from transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained prominence in recent years
for next-generation integrated electronics1 and nanophotonics
applications. In particular, MoS2 combined with other 2D materials
into vdW heterostructures, appears as an attractive candidate for
future transistor architectures2, atomically thin p-n junctions and
tunnel diodes3, memristors4, high-eﬃciency photodetectors5,
light emitting diodes6 and novel valleytronic devices7. Such
heterostructures are often assembled in a top-down manner by
picking-up discrete 2D material layers with a top hBN ﬂake and
placing the resulting stack on a target substrate. Although the
presence of a top hBN layer on one hand serves to encapsulate the
constituent 2D materials in the heterostructure, at the same time
however, it also hinders the fabrication of direct electrical contacts
to the underlying layers. Despite vdW heterostructures having been
extensively investigated, a practical route for making electrical
contacts to them in a scalable manner is still lacking.

In TMDC heterostructures assembled without any encapsulation
layer, further limitations arise when electrical contacts are made in
a conventional top-contact geometry. In this scenario, the contact
electrodes come in direct physical contact with a TMDC layer
over a ﬁnite area. Since such a methodology inherently requires
performing lithography on unprotected TMDC layers, it exposes
them to foreign chemical species which are diﬃcult to remove.
Additionally, bare TMDC surfaces in air are susceptible to O2
and H2O adsorption8–10. Owing to their atomically thin nature
however, mono- and few-layer TMDCs are quite sensitive to their
immediate environment which includes both surface adsorbates
from ambient exposure and processing residues. These act as
unintentional dopants leading to a spatially inhomogeneous carrier
density11, which causes device-to-device variations in threshold
voltage12,13 and Schottky barrier height14. Besides doping, surface
contaminants also scatter15 and trap charge carriers,
thereby
resulting in reduced mobility, low on-current8–10, increased ﬂicker
noise16,17, hysteresis18 and compromised optical properties19.
Although measurements performed under high vacuum after
in-situ annealing have made it possible to observe the intrinsic
20,21, unencapsulated
electrical
devices measured in air show a drastic reduction in carrier mobility,
implying that even short-term air exposure is detrimental for mono-
and bi-layer MoS2 devices8,9.

transport properties of MoS2

Therefore, for enabling a viable usage of TMDCs in integrated
electronics, better contact techniques are needed that allow for
encapsulation before contact patterning, in order to preserve the in-
trinsic material quality and achieve superior performance. Moreover,
encapsulation is also essential for long-term ambient stability since it

is well-known that most TMDCs, including MoS2, MoSe2 and WS2
undergo gradual oxidation in air at room temperature22, which leads
to further mobility degradation23, morphological changes24,25 and
adversely aﬀected photoluminescence26. In fact, some 2D materials
like MoTe2, HfSe2, ZrSe2, NbSe2, black phosphorus and InSe, are
so unstable in air that surface deterioration can be detected within
a day25. This restricts their assembly to an inert atmosphere27
and encapsulation in hBN is commonly employed to limit air
exposure23,27. With such materials, lithographic contact fabri-
cation prior to encapsulation is not only diﬃcult but also impractical.

In order to circumvent the issue of making electrical contacts
to hBN-TMDC-hBN heterostructures, a common practice is to
embed additional layers of graphene23,28,29 or metallic NbSe2
30,31
within the stack to act as electrodes. Pre-patterning contact vias
into the top hBN before pick-up32,33 or transfer of pre-patterned
metal ﬁlms onto TMDCs34 (or vice-versa) have also been reported.
However, alignment and transfer of multiple contact layers severely
increases the fabrication complexity, especially in multilayer
heterostructures, and becomes diﬃcult to scale-up for practical
purposes. Moreover, in case of graphene, the contact resistance
(R
C ) sensitively depends on the twist angle between the graphene
and TMDC layers which poses further alignment challenges35.
Even though large-area chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of
lateral graphene-MoS2 heterostructures has made progress in recent
years36–38, hard to control growth inhomogeneities38,39 as well
as ripples and strain induced by lattice mismatch still exist along
2D-2D edge interfaces40, which could ultimately hinder fabrication
of very short channel (<100 nm) devices. Another possibility
is to fabricate tunneling contacts on encapsulated TMDCs41–44.
However, such devices are restricted to very thin hBN (1-4L) or
oxide (∼2 nm)45 encapsulation layers for optimum carrier injection.
A more versatile approach is to etch through the top hBN layer in
order to expose an edge of any buried 2D material of interest and
form a one-dimensional (1D) ‘edge contact’ to it46,47. Although
such a strategy has been highly successful for graphene46, similar
48,49
attempts to make 1D edge contacts to monolayer (1L) MoS2
and few-layer WSe2

50 were met with limited success until now.

Here we report reliable edge contact formation to hBN encapsu-
lated 1L-MoS2. Our devices exhibit very low hysteresis together
with a high mobility and steep subthreshold swing, highlighting the
pristine interface quality achieved. By a systematic optimization
of the fabrication process, we obtain a moderately low contact
resistance and a high on-current (>50 µA/µm) with Ti-Au edge
contacts, despite a vanishingly small contact area. The contact
performance remains unchanged even at low temperatures, making
edge contacts promising for cryogenic experiments and applications.

Thus, our work introduces a universal approach for making eﬃcient
contacts to encapsulated 2D semiconductors, especially those
sensitive to air, and marks an important step towards pristine
devices with homogeneous electrical and optical characteristics on
a macroscopic scale. We believe that with further improvement of
the edge contact interface, by minimizing disorder and passivating
in-gap edge states, as discussed later, even smaller R
C is achievable.

Edge contacts fabrication

We will now discuss the fabrication strategy that we developed.
Detailed process parameters can be found in Supporting Section
S1. Bottom hBN ﬂakes were exfoliated directly on p+
Si/SiO2
(100 nm) substrates. 1L-MoS2 and top hBN ﬂakes were separately
exfoliated on GelPak® PDMS (poly-dimethylsiloxane) stamps
and transferred sequentially onto a suitable bottom hBN ﬂake,
as illustrated schematically in Figs. 1a, b. We found that PDMS
can leave substantial residues behind after transfer which we
minimized by pre-cleaning the PDMS surface in ultraviolet-ozone
(UV-O3) prior to exfoliation (see Ref. 51 for details). After each
transfer, the resulting stack was annealed at 200 ◦C in high-vacuum
for 3 h to release trapped bubbles, wrinkles and strain (if any)
induced by PDMS during transfer51. Figure 1c shows the optical
image of a 1L-MoS2 ﬂake transferred onto hBN from PDMS. To
fully encapsulate the MoS2, another hBN ﬂake was subsequently
transferred on top.

For device fabrication, bubble-free areas were chosen and
patterned into rectangular sections by e-beam lithography (EBL)
with PMMA (poly-methylmethacrylate) and reactive ion etching
(RIE). Contact trenches were deﬁned in a second EBL step and
the exposed hBN-MoS2-hBN was etched away by RIE to create
MoS2 edges for making contacts, as depicted in Fig. 1d (also see

Supporting Fig. S1). The samples were then loaded into an e-beam
evaporator for metal deposition, which we found to be the most
critical part of the whole fabrication process. An etched MoS2
edge consists of dangling bonds as well as defects like Mo- and
S-vacancies that are much more reactive than the basal plane of
52. During the time elapsed between etching and metal
MoS2
deposition, O2 and H2O molecules can not only bind to such edge
52.
sites but also potentially convert unpassivated Mo into MoOx
However, MoOx, which is often used as a hole transport layer in
solar cells, hinders electron injection into MoS2 due to its high
work-function53. This scenario is in strong contrast to top contacts
where MoOx formation is unlikely.

+

Hence, immediately before metal deposition, MoOx and any
adsorbed O2 or H2O were removed by in-situ Ar
sputtering at
±15° tilt angle to expose a fresh MoS2 edge (Fig. 1e). Tilting
the sample is necessary to access the etched hBN-MoS2-hBN
sidewalls shadowed by an overhanging PMMA bilayer with an
inward slope and avoid re-deposition of sputtered PMMA over the
MoS2 edges. Ti-Au (5-40 nm) was then deposited at ±15° tilt under
a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 mbar (Fig. 1f-g). After lift-oﬀ, the
devices were annealed in Ar + H2 at 300 ◦C for 3 hrs to improve the
Ti-MoS2 edge interface and reduce contact resistance (Supporting
Section S2). Note that the use of Ti is essential for providing good
adhesion to hBN sidewalls. Without Ti, pure Au tends to reﬂow
and lose contact during annealing at 300 ◦C (Supporting Section
S4). The ﬁnal set of devices with edge contacts are shown in Fig. 1h.

To investigate the inﬂuence of the metal-MoS2 contact edge
cleanliness on carrier injection, a set of three control devices
that were not Ar
sputtered, were also fabricated on the same
hBN-MoS2-hBN stack shown in Fig. 1h (outlined in red). All
control devices conduct a signiﬁcantly lower I
D than in Figs. 2b-d,
indicating that carrier injection can be hindered if the MoS2
edge is not freshly cleaned immediately before metal deposition
(Supporting Section S5). Additionally, it has been reported that Ti
can partially oxidize during evaporation, depending on the vacuum
level inside the deposition chamber, and thereby result in TiOx
formation at the contact interface61. To inhibit the oxidation of
Ti, we deposited Ti-Au on another set of devices (again without
sputtering) at a 10x lower base pressure of ∼1 × 10−8 mbar,
Ar
with negligible residual O2 (Supporting Section S5). However, a
low I
D is also observed in this case, revealing the existence of an
R
C dominated transport. This implies that a better vacuum does
+
not lead to any appreciable change in the contact properties if Ar
sputtering is not done. It must be emphasized that an optimum
post-deposition annealing temperature is also crucial for improving
the contact interface (Supporting Section S2). Hence, our key
ﬁnding here is that a clean MoS2 edge (before metallization) and
annealing (after metallization) are both essential for forming good
edge contacts, like those demonstrated in Figs. 2b-d. This likely
explains why such a high current density had not been observed
previously48,49.

comprised of both forward and backward sweeps which display
a very small hysteresis. A magniﬁed plot of the subthreshold
characteristics is shown in the inset of Fig. 2c and reveals a low
subthreshold swing (SS) of 116 mV/dec maintained up to nearly
4 orders of magnitude. Realization of such a steep slope and low
hysteresis was made possible here by encapsulation in hBN which
not only protects the MoS2 channel from processing residues,
but also provides an atomically smooth dielectric interface free
of dangling bonds and defects. This signiﬁcantly decreases the
interface trap density in comparison with an exposed MoS2 layer
on a SiO2 substrate. Moreover, the absence of thermally populated
surface optical phonons in hBN at room temperature leads to a

C values reported for graphene top contacts on hBN encapsulated
1L-MoS2 devices (20 kΩ·µm)28 as well as CVD grown lateral
graphene - MoS2 contacts (10-50 kΩ·µm)37,38. But at the same time,
compared to the latter case, we observe a higher mobility owing to
hBN encapsulation. These results unambiguously demonstrate that
edge contacts can replace graphene contacts in encapsulated devices
and achieve better performance with a less restrictive and scalable
fabrication methodology. Moreover, use of graphene with MoS2 is
currently limited to electron injection only, whereas with a proper
choice of edge contact material, hole injection can also be feasible55.

T

For completeness, it should be clariﬁed that in our analysis R

C is
assumed to be independent of V
GS whereas in conventional contacts,
it decreases asymptotically with increasing carrier density for low
V
GS near the onset of inversion, and slowly saturates at high V
GS .
Such a behavior arises from the fact that in Ti-MoS2 top contacts
with an interfacial oxide (often unintentional), increasing V
GS
reduces the sheet resistivity of MoS2 below the contact region and
66,
also lowers the potential barrier for electron injection into MoS2
67. Moreover,
which increases the eﬀective current transfer length L
at the same time the applied V
GS also pushes the conduction band
(CB) minimum closer to the metal Fermi level, thereby bending
the CB more steeply near the contact edge, which narrows the
eﬀective Schottky barrier width67. This two-fold mechanism leads

to a strong reduction of R
However, in edge contacts where a 2D metal-MoS2 overlap region
is absent (L
T ≈ 0), the primary mechanism behind R
C reduction
with increasing V
GS is Schottky barrier narrowing, being more
pronounced near the subthreshold region and saturating soon after.
This causes R
C to show a gate dependence that is weak enough to

regime. Hence, the R
C we estimated is the V
GS independent value at
large carrier densities, similar to Ref. 64. The most accurate way
of extracting R
C is the transfer length method (TLM). However,

it requires fabrication of several devices with decreasing channel
lengths and only works well when all devices have a very similar R
and µ
0 , such that a plot of total resistance vs. channel length follows
a straight line. This has turned out to be challenging at present for
our devices. Hence, we employed a simpler method, which gives a
reasonable estimate of R

helps in quantifying the device-to-device variability, unlike TLM.

GS characteristics
as well as the edge contact resistance in Figs. 4a-b remain essentially
unchanged up to 120 K. This observed temperature insensitivity of
R
C agrees very well with previous ﬁndings on 1D edge contacts
to graphene46 as well as CVD grown graphene edge contacts to
37, and demonstrates that carrier injection into MoS2 via
1L-MoS2
edge contacts occurs eﬃciently even under cryogenic conditions.
Moreover, the I
DS characteristics at 122 K plotted in Fig. 4c,
behave similar to those at room temperature seen earlier for
the device in Fig. 2a. To shed some light on this behavior, we
performed ab initio quantum transport simulations following the
procedure described in our earlier publication66 and are discussed in
Supporting Section S6. In brief, the majority of the current injected
via Ti edge contacts into MoS2 does not come from thermionic
emission over the contact Schottky barrier, but rather tunneling
across the barrier. Since the electron transmission probability near
the Fermi level remains relatively constant as a function of energy
(Supporting Fig. S10), the tunneling current varies only weakly
with temperature. We found that this tendency persists for a range
of Schottky barrier heights that were evaluated.

Discussion and conclusions

11 and WSe2

Strictly speaking, the true bandstructure of a semiconductor
is deﬁned for a lattice with an inﬁnitely repeating unit cell. At
MoS2 edges and grain boundaries, dangling bonds and Mo-,
S-vacancies perturb the MoS2 bandstructure and give birth to
additional localized ‘edge states’ within the bandgap, as measured
experimentally11,70. Such states were also observed in air-exposed
71 devices, implying that adsorbed O2 and H2O
MoS2
do not fully passivate them. Passivation of dangling bonds and edge
states is essential for good edge contacts72, which may be achieved
by Ti-MoS2 bonding. However, if a van der Waals gap or trapped
air molecules are present between the MoS2 edge and Ti, edge
state passivation could be hindered, resulting in a high density of
in-gap states at each electron injection site. By trapping incoming
electrons, these states can cause a space charge region to build up
which would repel further injected electrons. In this regard, in-situ
sputtering plays a key role in producing a clean MoS2 edge
Ar
immediately before Ti deposition. Subsequent annealing at 300 ◦C
promotes atomic rearrangement and Ti-MoS2 bonding. The need
for such extra measures does not arise in the case of edge contacts
to graphene, where edge states (if any) are unable to trap carriers
because of the absence of a bandgap. Even O2 incorporation
at the graphene edge was shown to have a negligible eﬀect46,
thus greatly simplifying fabrication of edge contacts to graphene.
This scenario is fundamentally diﬀerent from top contacts where
the injected electrons do not encounter any edge states since the
translational symmetry of the underlying MoS2 lattice is not broken
(in the absence of interfacial reactions and defects) and on the
contrary, a vdW gap is beneﬁcial for avoiding Fermi level pinning34.

Interactions between the contact metal and MoS2 at the atomic
scale and structural characteristics of the contact interface play
a signiﬁcant role in governing the performance of any contact.
For edge contacts in particular, where carrier transfer is restricted
to a single atomic edge, an optimum metal-MoS2 interface is
crucial. This makes them more challenging to fabricate compared
to top contacts which impose fewer constraints and can tolerate
local non-idealities to a greater extent due to the availability of a
ﬁnite area. Our main achievement here lies in the development of
an optimized process for realizing low resistance edge contacts
with a high density of current injection per atomic site. Further
studies are needed nevertheless to unravel the rich physics and
chemistry occurring at the contact interface. Atomically resolved
cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging
can be performed to gain better insights into the contact morphology,
interface quality and atomic conﬁguration of edge contacts. This
would lead to a deeper understanding of the transport behavior
and provide valuable guidelines for further improvement of
the contact performance.
It is possible that unpassivated edge
states at interface voids still undermine the performance of our
devices72 and also cause undesired Fermi level pinning73. Suitable
chemical termination of dangling bonds could be a promising

reduce R
C even further. Apart from MoS2, air sensitive TMDCs
like HfS2, ZrS2, etc. where edge states are expected to lie at
shallow levels close to the band extrema, which makes them more
immune to defects, appear as attractive materials for edge contacts74.

It should be emphasized that even though ∼µm long Ti-Au54,
Ag-Au13 and In-Au75 top contacts on 1L-MoS2 have resulted
in a lower R
C than that obtained in this work, in order to be fair,
a comparison should be made with top contacts scaled down to
sub-nm overlap lengths. However, it has been shown that the R
C
begins to increase considerably for contact lengths smaller than the
current transfer length in both mono-67 and multi-layer MoS2
76.
This implies that conventional contacts cannot be scaled down
beyond a certain limit, thereby restricting the minimum achievable
device footprint (gate length + 2 x contact length). To ensure
scaling of TMDC based devices, scalable contact geometries that
work eﬃciently irrespective of dimensions are necessary. This
bottleneck could be overcome by means of edge contacts, which do
not require a 2D overlap with TMDCs and thus, in principle, can be
made as narrow as possible. Another domain where edge contacts
can outperform top contacts is multilayer TMDCs, in which carrier
injection only via the topmost layer suﬀers from added interlayer
hopping resistances that limit the current transport to top few
layers77, whereas with edge contacts, each layer can be individually
contacted for achieving higher current densities78. In this regard,
80 also
1T-phase edge contacts to few layer MoS2
seem to be an attractive choice, although inducing a 2H → 1T
phase transition under the contact regions after encapsulation can
be problematic.

79 and MoTe2

Lastly,

the possibility to encapsulate 2D materials before
processing with chemicals remains the biggest advantage of edge
contacts for building clean devices. Fundamental studies rely on
high interface quality and macroscopic homogeneity for uncovering
new physical phenomena, which can beneﬁt from edge contacts
fabricated after encapsulation. Edge contacts are especially promis-
ing for 2D materials unstable in air for which fabrication of top
contacts is challenging due to restrictions imposed by encapsulation
inside an inert atmosphere before being exposed to air. Often
such heterostructures are built in a top-down manner and the need
to make contacts to buried layers demands pick-up of additional

6

graphene sheets. In such scenarios, edge contacts provide a much
higher ﬂexibility in heterostructure assembly and can be scaled-up
to integrated circuits employing multiple metal layers separated by
insulating dielectric layers. Thus, we envision that edge contacts
will bring devices based on 2D materials one step closer to practical
implementation and open up new pathways in 2D materials research.
