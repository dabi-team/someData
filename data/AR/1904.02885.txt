Dual-phase xenon detectors are widely used in dark matter direct detection experiments, and
have demonstrated the highest sensitivities to a variety of dark matter interactions. However, a
key component of the dual-phase detector technology–the eﬃciency of charge extraction from liquid
xenon into gas–has not been well characterized. In this paper, we report a new measurement of
the electron extraction eﬃciency (EEE) in a small xenon detector using two mono-energetic decay
features of 37Ar. By achieving stable operation at very high voltages, we measured the EEE values
at the highest extraction electric ﬁeld strength reported to date. For the ﬁrst time, an apparent
saturation of the EEE is observed over a large range of electric ﬁeld; between 7.5 kV/cm and
10.4 kV/cm extraction ﬁeld in the liquid xenon the EEE stays stable at the level of 1%(kV/cm)−1.
In the context of electron transport models developed for xenon, we discuss how the observed
saturation may help calibrate this relative EEE measurement to the absolute EEE values.
In
addition, we present the implications of this result not only to current and future xenon-based dark
matter searches, but also to xenon-based searches for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scatters.

INTRODUCTION

Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs)
have demonstrated exceptionally high sensitivities to var-
ious dark matter candidates, including both weakly inter-
acting massive particles (WIMPs) [1–3] and leptophilic
dark matter [4, 5]. They also oﬀer a promising, scalable
method for measurement of coherent scattering of reactor
antineutrinos [6]. Xenon TPCs enjoy high sensitivity to
these rare interactions primarily due to their extremely
low intrinsic radioactive background levels and the ef-
ﬁcient collection of both scintillation photons and ion-
ization electrons produced by particle interactions [7, 8].
The latter feature enables such detectors to obtain accu-
rate three-dimensional position reconstruction capabili-
ties and powerful particle type identiﬁcation [8, 9].

A typical dual-phase xenon TPC consists of liquid ac-
tive volume in the bottom and a thin gas layer above
it. Particle interactions in the dense liquid can produce
atomic excitations and ionizations [10]. The excitations
lead to the emission of prompt scintillation photons. The
ionization electrons can either recombine with ions to
produce additional scintillation, or escape the recombi-
nation process and become quasifree electrons [11]. To
detect these electrons, an electric ﬁeld is applied to drift
them to the liquid surface and extract them into the gas,
where they produce electroluminescence (EL) light [7].
Collection of this secondary EL light gives an ampliﬁed

measurement of the ionization signal strength, which im-
proves the overall energy resolution, and enhances posi-
tion reconstruction and particle identiﬁcation. In addi-
tion, the EL ampliﬁcation mechanism also allows mod-
ern xenon TPCs to detect faint signals down to single
extracted electrons in the gas with O(100%) eﬃciency,
opening up the possibility of detecting extremely low en-
ergy interactions, such as that expected from scattering
of low-mass WIMPs, certain dark-sector dark matter par-
ticles and reactor antineutrinos with xenon [6, 12–14]. In
such cases, the scintillation signal becomes too small to
be detectable but a handful of ionization electrons may
be collected.

Although dual-phase xenon TPCs are currently in wide
use in dark matter search experiments, the eﬃciency of
extracting ionization electrons from liquid xenon into
gas has not yet been fully characterized.
In all exist-
ing measurements [15–17], the electron extraction eﬃ-
ciency (EEE) is observed to increase monotonically with
the extraction electric ﬁeld even at the highest probed
ﬁelds, while a saturation should occur if 100% EEE is ap-
proached. In addition, measurements by diﬀerent groups
do not fall within one another’s experimental uncertain-
ties. Part of this discrepancy may be attributed to the
diﬀerent assumptions of full electron extraction in these
measurements, which can be clariﬁed if 100% EEE is ex-
perimentally measured.

Furthermore, understanding the EEE is important for
the following reasons. First, conﬂicting EEE values re-
sult in systematic diﬀerences in the ionization energy
scale between experiments, which directly aﬀects the de-
rived dark matter search sensitivity, as well as the de-
rived reactor antineutrino coherent scatter rate. Second,
incomplete electron extraction is thought to be one of
the leading causes of relatively high rates of few-electron
events observed in low-background xenon TPC exper-

iments [16, 18–20]. This is a limiting background in
searches for WIMPs of mχ < 10 GeV /c2 and MeV-scale
dark-photon-mediated dark matter interactions, which
are expected to produce O(1)- to O(10)-electron ioniza-
tion events in xenon targets [12–14]. Reactor antineu-
trino experiments using dual-phase noble liquid TPCs
are expected to have a very similar signature to that
arising from these dark matter models - a rapid falling
energy spectrum below 10 ionization electrons. Current
xenon TPC experiments all operate at insuﬃcient ex-
traction electric ﬁelds, at which electron extraction is in-
complete and the EEE values are uncertain. Therefore
an improved understanding of the EEE can help inter-
pret existing and future data, as well as provide a path
forward to maximize the scientiﬁc reach of future xenon-
based experiments.

In this paper, we report a new EEE measurement con-
ducted at the highest extraction electric ﬁeld up to date,
providing the most comprehensive EEE calibration for
dual-phase xenon TPCs. For the ﬁrst time, a clear sat-
uration of the EEE is observed over a large electric ﬁeld
window, suggesting that 100% EEE may have ﬁnally
been demonstrated.

This paper is organized as follows:

in Section II, we
review theories on how electrons in the liquid may be ex-
tracted into gas and experimental techniques that have
been used to measure the EEE; in Section III, we describe
our EEE measurement method and the apparatus used
in this experiment; Section IV explains the data analysis
techniques; Section V presents the results of this mea-
surement and discusses the implications to current and
future dark matter searches; in Section VI, we summarize
the conclusions.

II. ELECTRON EMISSION MECHANISMS AND
OVERVIEW OF EEE EXPERIMENTS

Due to their large atomic size, Xe atoms can be polar-
ized by excess electrons and thereby exert an attractive
force on them. This eﬀect is stronger in the liquid phase
than that in the gas due to the dielectric constant diﬀer-
ence. As a result, the ground-state energy of a quasifree
electron is lower in the liquid than that in the gas, form-
ing an energy barrier of ∼0.6-0.85 eV at the liquid-gas
boundary [7, 21, 22]. For an electron near the liquid sur-
face, the net eﬀect of the inhomogeneous polarizations
in the two diﬀerent dielectric materials may be approxi-
mated as a mirror charge on the other side of the bound-
ary, which adds to the ground potential diﬀerence in the
medium [7], as illustrated in Figure 1 (left, solid line,
blue). In order for electrons in the liquid to emit into the
gas, they have to carry a high enough momentum in the
direction towards the gas to overcome the energy barrier.
At liquid xenon temperature (∼175 K), the thermal en-
ergy of electrons is approximately 0.015 eV, too low to
produce signiﬁcant thermal electron emissions.

When an external electric ﬁeld is applied to the liq-

ﬁelds. Right: The measured electron drift velocity in liquid
xenon as a function of electric ﬁeld [23], illustrating the energy

measurement results can be found in [24] and [25].

uid, quasifree electrons will drift along the direction of
the ﬁeld, and gain energy from electric ﬁeld acceleration
between collisions. Figure 1 (right) shows the increas-
ing drift velocity of electrons in liquid xenon with elec-
tric ﬁeld [23], demonstrating the energy transfer from
the static electric ﬁeld to the electrons. The dynamics of
electrons in noble gases/liquids under an external electric
ﬁeld has been extensively modeled in condensed matter
physics [23, 26–32]. A notable approach in these studies
is the Cohen-Lekner transport theory, which introduces a
structure factor S( (cid:126)K) to approximate the collective scat-
tering of hot electrons with atoms in condensed phases,
and solves the modiﬁed Boltzmann equation to derive the
electron energy distribution function [27]. Implementa-
tions of this method have successfully reproduced exper-
imental data on the ﬁeld dependence of electron mobility
and diﬀusion properties in liquid xenon [23, 29, 30, 32].
They also predict that the electron energy will increase
monotonically with electric ﬁeld until it becomes compa-
rable to the ﬁrst excitation energy level (∼8 eV for liq-
uid xenon) [23, 29]. The increasing electron energy will
then enable electron emission from the liquid into the
gas, which has an experimentally observed threshold of
∼1.5-2 kV/cm, with the extraction eﬃciencies increasing
with applied ﬁeld strength [15–17].

In addition to increasing the electron energy, an elec-
tric ﬁeld at the liquid-gas boundary also reduces the bar-
rier height and width (Schottky eﬀect) [7], as illustrated
in Figure 1 (left, dashed line, red). These eﬀects will
make it easier for electrons in the liquid to be emitted
into the gas, and also reduces the chance for an emit-

is worth noting that when a cloud of electrons approach
the liquid surface, although only electrons with high mo-
mentum values in the direction towards the gas are emit-
ted in the ﬁrst place, the rest of electrons with suﬃ-
cient kinetic energy can gain the “correct” momentum
after scattering with xenon atoms. Thanks to the much
smaller electron mass compared to that of the xenon
atoms, electrons barely lose any energy during elastic
scattering with xenon; it has been estimated that elec-
trons approximately lose 0.1% of their kinetic energy for
their directions to be ﬂipped [22]. As a result, all elec-
trons with suﬃcient kinetic energy in pure liquid xenon
should be able to emit into the gas after several attempts
within nanoseconds.

A few experimental eﬀorts have been made to directly
evaluate the EEE dependence on electric ﬁeld [15–17].
An early measurement by Gushchin et al. attempted to
derive the absolute EEE values by comparing the ioniza-
tion current collected by an electrode when it was above
liquid xenon and when it was immersed in the liquid [15].
The result suggested that electron extraction starts be-
low 2 kV/cm and the extraction eﬃciency keeps increas-
ing up to the highest attained ﬁeld of 4.3 kV/cm. Re-
cent experiments took a diﬀerent approach by measuring
the number of extracted electrons from mono-energetic
decays at diﬀerent extraction ﬁelds in dual-phase xenon
TPCs [16, 17]. Given that the average number of elec-
trons available for extraction is constant for monoen-
ergetic sources, the numbers of extracted electrons are
proportional to the EEE values at the liquid-gas bound-
ary. However, without independently measuring the to-
tal numbers of electrons produced by the sources, EEE
values measured in these experiments may carry an un-
known scaling factor and are usually referred to as rela-
tive measurements. As explained in Section V, a deﬁni-
tive saturation in the relative EEE value is a strong in-
dication of approaching 100% absolute EEE. Hint of a
possible saturation was suggested by XENON100 in a
narrow ﬁeld window of ∼0.5 kV/cm at >5 kV/cm [16],
but a more recent measurement argued that the EEE still
increases in this ﬁeld range [17].

An indirect method to obtain absolute EEE values is
to use the anticorrelation between the charge and scintil-
lation channels in liquid xenon [33]. For mono-energetic
radioactive sources, the anti-correlation can be formu-
lated as:

Nγ,ob
(cid:15)γ

+

Ne,ob
(cid:15)e

= Nq(E)

(1)

where Nγ,ob and Ne,ob are the detected numbers of scin-
tillation photons and electrons, (cid:15)γ and (cid:15)e are the experi-
mental eﬃciencies, and Nq is the total number of quanta
produced by the source and is often modeled as a lin-
ear function of energy Nq = E/W [34, 35]. Given di-
rect knowledge of (cid:15)γ or Nq, one can derive the absolute
EEE ((cid:15)e) value using the measured anticorrelation be-
tween Nγ,ob and Ne,ob. This method has been attempted

3

by both LUX [2] and XENON1T [36], but the obtained
EEE values are subject to uncertainties in the Nq.

III. APPARATUS AND MEASUREMENTS

FIG. 2. Schematic of the dual-phase xenon detector. The
active xenon volume of
5 cm×2.5 cm is contained in an
electric ﬁeld-shaping cage made of copper rings and stainless
steel grids connected through Giga-Ohm resistors. vacuum-
ultraviolet (VUV)-sensitive photomultipliers (PMTs) collect
the xenon scintillation and EL light from both above and
below the active volume.

(cid:31)

The measurements presented in this work were made
with the XeNu apparatus, a prototype dual-phase TPC
optimized for measuring low-energy ionization signals.
The detector consists of a cylindrical active volume con-
taining approximately 140 g of liquid xenon in an electric
ﬁeld-shaping cage. Electrons from ionization events in
this active volume are drifted upwards via applied elec-
tric ﬁelds and extracted into a gas region. The EL light
produced by extracted electrons in the gas is detected
by an array of VUV-sensitive PMTs:
four Hamamatsu
R8520-406 PMTs (2.6 cm×2.6 cm) measure the light
from above, giving horizontal position information, and
one Hamamatsu R8778 PMT (
5.6 cm) is immersed in
the liquid below the active xenon to increase the light
collection eﬃciency. To enhance position reconstruction
accuracy and avoid possible high voltage instabilities, no
reﬂector was installed around the electric ﬁeld cage. A
schematic of the detector internals is shown in Fig. 2.

Three grids supply the electric ﬁelds for drifting and
extracting electrons: the cathode, extraction grid, and

tom PMT from the high voltage applied to the cathode.
All grids are made from a stainless steel hexagonal mesh
(acid etched, 90% transparent at normal incidence) press-
ﬁt into metal rings for mechanical stability 1. The active
volume is surrounded by three additional copper rings
which step down in voltage to create a uniform electric
ﬁeld throughout. The liquid level in the detector is set
to be approximately in the middle between the extrac-
tion grid and the anode, and its exact position is deter-
mined by the height of a spillover reservoir. High voltage
(HV) to the extraction grid and the cathode was pro-
vided through two custom-made HV feedthroughs. Dur-
ing data taking, up to 21 kV HV was applied to the ex-
traction grid and up to 22 kV was applied to the cathode.
The anode was grounded in all measurements.

Xenon is circulated continuously through a closed
loop during detector operation. Liquid is drawn from
the spillover reservoir into a dual-phase heat exchanger,
where it is evaporated and pumped through a SAES
MonoTorr getter for gas-phase puriﬁcation. The puri-
ﬁed gas is then cooled down by the heat exchanger, re-
condensed and delivered directly to the bottom of the
detector to avoid disturbing the liquid surface. The cir-
culation rate is regulated by an MKS mass ﬂow controller
(MFC) and operated between 1.2 and 2.1 Standard Liter
Per Minute (SLPM), turning over all ∼1.5 kg of xenon
in the system in 2 - 4 hours, ensuring suﬃcient xenon
purity for the experiment.

To provide a source of low-energy, mono-energetic sig-
nals in our detector for the EEE studies, 37Ar gas was in-
jected directly into the xenon circulation loop. This tech-
nique has been used previously to calibrate both xenon
[37, 38] and argon [39] detectors. The source decays via
electron capture, with captures from either the L-shell
or K-shell depositing a total of 0.27 keV or 2.8 keV, re-
spectively, via a cascade of X-rays and/or Auger elec-
trons. The L/K capture branching ratio is ∼0.1 [40]. For
this work, the 37Ar calibration source was generated by
a 40 hr irradiation of natural argon gas at the McClellan
Nuclear Research Center TRIGA reactor. Thermal neu-
tron capture on 36Ar and 40Ar created the radioisotopes
37Ar and 41Ar. After irradiation, the gas was subject to a
two day cool-oﬀ period, during which the 41Ar (t1/2 = 1.8
hrs) decayed away while 37Ar (t1/2 = 35 days) remained.
The remaining gas contained ∼100 µCi of 37Ar dissolved
in ∼40 g of natAr. For each measurement, we injected
O(10) Bq of 37Ar into the detector to produce low-energy
decays uniformly distributed throughout the liquid active
volume. To suppress ambient gamma-ray backgrounds in
the 37Ar measurements, the detector was surround on all
sides with at least 5 mm of lead shielding.

The data analyzed in this work were taken in two sep-
arate conﬁgurations, changing the heights of the liquid

and gas volumes between the extraction grid and the an-
ode. In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, the top of the spillover
reservoir was set 7.5±0.5 mm above the extraction grid
and 8.4±0.5 mm below the anode grid. In the second, the
top of the spillover reservoir was set 8.0±0.5 mm above
the extraction grid and 6.4±0.5 mm below the anode
grid. The liquid level was estimated to be 0.5±0.5 mm
above the top of the spillover reservoir due to ﬂuid dy-
namics [41]. Because of the smaller distance between the
extraction and anode grids in the second conﬁguration,
a higher electric ﬁeld was achieved for the same applied
voltage. For this reason, the ﬁrst conﬁguration is referred
to as the low ﬁeld (LF) conﬁguration, and the second is
referred to as the high ﬁeld (HF) conﬁguration. In addi-
tion to the change in grid distance, the HF conﬁguration
also introduced a 0.5 mm thick PEEK cover on the ex-
traction grid holder in hope of enhancing high voltage
stability. The eﬀects of charge buildup on the PEEK
cover or the Cirlex ring was modeled using a COMSOL
electrostatics simulation and was found to have a negli-
gible impact (<1% on the extraction ﬁeld) on these mea-
surements. An extraction electric ﬁeld of 8.6 kV/cm in
liquid xenon was achieved in the LF run, and 10.4 kV/cm
was achieved in the HF run. In the following discussions,
the electric ﬁeld value in the liquid above the extraction
grid is used unless speciﬁed otherwise. Data from both
the LF and HF experiments are presented below.

IV. DATA ANALYSIS

The raw data consisted of digitized waveforms from all
ﬁve PMTs (×10 ampliﬁed linearly) using Struck SIS3316
digitizers (14 bit, 250 MHz). For each of the PMT wave-
forms, an adaptive baseline was ﬁrst calculated to sepa-
rate PMT output pulses from electronic noise. The gain
of each PMT was calibrated by evaluating the average
size of single photoelectron (p.e.) pulses in regions of low
pulse frequency. PMT saturation eﬀects were observed
for pulses with amplitudes of ∼1 V after ×10 ampliﬁca-
tion; as a result, pulses within 5 ms following large pulses
were excluded from the calibration to avoid biases. The
gain-normalized waveforms from all the PMTs were then
added together to form summed waveforms, which were
further processed for pulse identiﬁcation and pulse quan-
tity evaluation.

In this analysis, a pulse is registered if the integral of
the summed waveform within a preset window (depend-
ing on extraction ﬁeld) exceed an adjustable threshold,
which is set to be below half of the value of the single
electron integral for this dataset. Piled-up pulses that do
not cross the absolute threshold between peaks are also
resolved by comparing the peak-to-valley diﬀerence with
a relative threshold. For every pulse identiﬁed, we calcu-
lated the pulse area A in the unit of p.e. and several other
characterization parameters including the pulse integral
times and top bottom asymmetry (TBA). The pulse inte-
gral time tf is deﬁned as the time when the pulse integral

rises to a speciﬁed percentage of the overall pulse area,
relative to the start time of the pulse. In the analysis, we
usually use the diﬀerence between two tf ’s for pulse iden-
tiﬁcations. For example, W10−50 = t50 − t10 is a measure
of the pulse width between 10% pulse integral and 50%
pulse integral. A typical liquid xenon scintillation pulse
has a W10−50 value of < 0.1 µs, while that of a typical EL
pulse is at the order of 0.5-3 µs. The TBA parameter is
deﬁned as (AT − AB)/(AT + AB), where AT and AB are
the total pulse area in the top PMTs and in the bottom
PMT, respectively. The TBA is usually close to -0.8 for
scintillation pulses in the liquid and 0.4-0.5 for EL pulses
in the gas. Examples of the W10−50 and TBA distribu-
tions can be found in Section IV B. For EL pulses, the
lateral positions of an event were also calculated based
on the EL light distribution in the top PMT array, using
a simple center of gravity (CoG) method. The CoG po-
sitions were approximately calibrated by comparing the
density distribution of 37Ar decay events in the CoG pa-
rameter space to that in the real world space (assumed
uniform).

making them relatively easy to identify. One example
SE pulse is shown in the inset of Figure 3, which consists
of approximately 70 p.e. from all 5 PMTs.

To evaluate the average SE pulse area at a certain am-
pliﬁcation electric ﬁeld, we selected the well-separated
SEs that were >5 ms after large EL pulses that may
have saturated the PMTs. Pulses that occurred at or
before the trigger time in each event window were also
excluded to avoid possible biases due to trigger eﬃciency
loss for small pulses.
In addition, it was required that
the pulse width parameter W25−75 and the TBA of a
candidate pulse to not deviate from the mean values for
this dataset for more than 1.5σ to reject misidentiﬁed SE
pulses and abnormal events. Figure 3 shows the SE spec-
trum for data acquired at an electric ﬁeld of 6.0 kV/cm
in the LF run, where, in addition to a SE peak, a dou-
ble electron (DE) peak is also observed at approximately
two times of the SE peak position. Due to the weaker
ampliﬁcation ﬁeld at the perimeter of the grids and the
position dependence of the EL light collection eﬃciency,
the observed SE size exhibited a mild dependence on the
event position. In this analysis only SE pulses emerging
in the central 1 cm×1 cm active volume were selected;
although the EL gain was veriﬁed to be approximately
uniform at larger radii using 37Ar data, SE events out-
side this central volume began to get contaminated by
events near the perimeter of the TPC due to the limited
position resolution of SE pulses.

FIG. 3. The measured SE spectrum at a liquid electric ﬁeld of
6.0 kV/cm (11.2 kV/cm in the gas) in the LF run. The peak
around 72 p.e. is from SE pulses and that around 145 p.e. is
from double electron (DE) pulses. In the ﬁt function, the DE
peak position is ﬁxed at twice of that for the SE peak, and
2 times of the SE width. The inset

√

To calculate the number of detected electrons for 37Ar
pulses, the average size of SE pulses in the number of
p.e. needs to be determined ﬁrst.
In this experiment,
SEs are often observed shortly after multi-electron EL
pulses, at an estimated total rate of a few tens of Hz, of-
fering a convenient way for the SE gain to be calibrated.
Over the range of electric ﬁelds applied to the EL gas
region in the 37Ar measurements, the observed SEs con-
tain 30 - 100 p.e. within time windows of ∼0.5-3 µs,

ﬁelds applied to the liquid xenon (axis on the bottom) and to
the gas (axis on the top) for both the LF data (blue circles,
axis on the right) and the HF data (black squares, axis on
the left). The error bars on the SE area include the statisti-
cal uncertainties from the ﬁt (∼1%), and that from varying
the SE selection cuts by 1σ (use an average value of 1%). The
red line shows a linear function ﬁtted to both datasets above
4 kV/cm, after the diﬀerent EL gap sizes are taken into con-
sideration. The EL threshold is estimated to be 1.6 kV/cm
ampliﬁcation ﬁeld in the gas.

The dependence of the measured SE gain as a function
of the electric ﬁelds applied to the liquid and that to the
gas, which diﬀer by the dielectric constant of the liquid
(assumed to be 1.85), is shown in Figure 4 for both the

calculated using a parallel plate approximation, with an
additional correction based on comparison with COM-
SOL simulations at the extreme voltage values. While
Ref. [17] reported a large electric ﬁeld diﬀerence of 12%
between COMSOL results and a parallel-plate estima-
tion, we calculated a smaller diﬀerence of ∼ 3 ± 1%. This
smaller discrepancy is likely to due to our use of hexag-
onal grid design compared to the parallel wire design in
[17]. The SE gain is approximately linear with the EL
ampliﬁcation ﬁeld and the EL gas gap size, similar to the
results reported in [17] and [42]. Below a liquid extrac-
tion ﬁeld of 4 kV/cm, the low detected photon numbers
in the SE pulses resulted a relatively large spread in the
reconstructed positions, causing a non-negligible contam-
ination of large-radii SE pulses in the selected ﬁducial
volume and lowering the apparent SE area. In the fol-
lowing analysis, a linear extrapolation is used to estimate
the SE area below 4 kV/cm extraction ﬁeld.

37Ar analysis

Thanks to the small active mass of the xenon TPC and
the lead shielding, the rate of background events (exclud-
ing SEs) in the detector was measured to be less than
10 Hz prior to 37Ar injection, and most of these back-
ground occurred in high energy regions above 100 keV.
On the other hand, by controlling the amount of 37Ar
gas injected into the xenon TPC, we obtained 37Ar de-
cay rates of O(10) Hz in both measurement campaigns.
Therefore, the rate of ambient radioactive background
was negligible in the energy region relevant to this 37Ar
analysis (<3 keV).

For the EEE evaluation, only the 37Ar events in the
center of the active volume were selected. Owing to the
much higher EL signal strength of 37Ar events than that
of SEs, their position resolution was greatly improved,
allowing a larger ﬁducial cut of 1.8 cm×1.8 cm to be
used. The electric ﬁeld in this volume was conﬁrmed
to be uniform with COMSOL simulations, and the ob-
served 37Ar peak value did not vary with event positions
above 5% level. However, as reported by the authors of
[43], a position reconstruction algorithm based on light
distribution in a four-PMT layout, as that used in our
detector, can misconstruct events on the edge of the de-
tector to be in the center. This ambiguity occurs because
all PMTs extend comparably small solid angles to the de-
tector perimeters, and detected approximately the same
number of photons for the edge events, mimicking that
of lower energy events near the center of the detector.

These edge events are rejected using the pulse width
parameter W10−50 and the TBA parameter. Figure 5
shows the distributions of the W10−50 parameter and
TBA for pulses of diﬀerent sizes in the 37Ar data taken
at an extraction ﬁeld of 6.0 kV/cm. In this dataset, the
events with pulse areas around 104 p.e. are determined to
be the K-shell 37Ar decays, and the events around 103 p.e.

as a function of EL pulse area (A) for 37Ar data taken at
an extraction electric ﬁeld of 6.0 kV/cm. The events with
low W10−50 and TBA values are liquid xenon scintillations,
and the ones with higher values are EL pulses. Because only
the largest pulse in an event is used for this plot, scintilla-
tion pulses with areas smaller than SEs are suppressed. 37Ar
events in the center of the detector can be observed with high
statistics around 104 p.e. (2.8 keV) and 103 p.e. (0.27 keV)
pulse area, and the cluster below 100 p.e. are SEs.

are from the L-shell 37Ar decays, while the ones around
70 p.e. are SEs. Due to the weaker ampliﬁcation ﬁeld and
the incomplete EL light collection, the edge events tend
to have smaller pulse width values, low photon numbers,
and lower TBA distributions compared to events in the
center of the TPC. In the following analysis, the events
within 2 σ from the peak W10−50 and TBA values are
selected. The position distributions of the 37Ar events
passing this cut were approximately uniform, conﬁrming
that the edge events have been suﬃciently suppressed.

Figure 6 (top) shows the 37Ar energy spectrum for the
6.0 kV/cm LF data with additional W10−50 and TBA
cuts applied. Both the K-shell (2.8 keV) and L-shell
(0.27 keV) 37Ar decay features can be clearly identiﬁed.
The K-shell 37Ar peak, however, exhibits an asymmet-
ric shape with a enhanced tail on the high energy side,
which is attributed to the contribution of 37Ar decay
events above the extraction grid (EG). The electric ﬁeld
in the liquid above the EG was approximately an order
of magnitude stronger than that below the EG (nomi-
nally at 400 V/cm), and as a result, the electron-ion re-
combination probability in this region was strongly sup-
pressed, eﬀectively producing more quasifree electrons
that could be drifted, extracted, and collected.
In ad-
dition, as the electron extraction ﬁeld was changed in
the experiment, the extent of recombination suppression
in this above-EG region also changed, resulting a ﬁeld-
dependent background in the EEE study. For the lower
energy L-shell 37Ar decays, this eﬀect was not observed,
possibly because the recombination probability was neg-
ligible at all ﬁelds due to the extremely low ionization

events below the EG (black), selected using a drift time cut,
and above the EG (light blue), measured with reversed drift
electric ﬁeld. Solid lines are the corresponding Gaussian ﬁts,
and the dashed line shows the function values outside the ﬁt
region.

Two diﬀerent methods were investigated to suppress
this above-EG background for the K-shell 37Ar analysis.
The ﬁrst method was to pair EL pulses with prompt scin-
tillations, and to use the time separation between the two
signals – usually referred to as the electron drift time – to
estimate the depth of the decay site. Approximately 60%
of the K-shell 37Ar decays were observed with a prompt
scintillation signal at or above the single p.e. level, and
thus allow the electron drift time to be calculated. Fig-
ure 7 (top) shows the drift time distribution of K-shell
37Ar decays in the 6.0 kV/cm LF data, where a clear cut-
oﬀ is observed at 17 µs, corresponding to the maximum
drift time in the TPC. Due to the small size of the 37Ar
scintillation signals, random coincidence of single p.e.
pulses and EL pulses was non-negligible, as illustrated by
the events with large drift time values in Figure 7 (top).
It was estimated that ∼20% of the events with normal
drift time value were from random coincidence, approxi-
mately a quarter of which (∼5%) were from above the EG
based on liquid volume considerations (∼7-8 mm liquid
above the EG and ∼26 mm below the EG). The energy
spectrum of below-EG K-shell 37Ar events, selected us-
ing a drift time cut, is shown in Figure 6 (bottom, black
line). The L-shell peak in this spectrum is mostly from
random coincidence, and therefore includes events both
above and below the EG. For the peak positions of K-
shell 37Ar decays to be determined, the high energy tail
was excluded from the Gaussian ﬁts to further reduce

FIG. 7. Drift time distributions for K-shell 37Ar decays in the
6.0 kV/cm LF data, with nominal drift ﬁeld (top) and with
reversed drift ﬁeld (bottom). In the reversed ﬁeld data, only
ionization events above the EG can be detected.

The second method was to statistically subtract the
above-EG 37Ar decay events.
In both the LF and HF
measurement campaigns, we took reversed-drift 37Ar
data in which a drift ﬁeld of ∼-400 or ∼-800 V/cm was
applied to the liquid xenon volume below the EG, so only
the above-EG 37Ar decay events could be detected in the
gas phase. The drift time distribution for the reversed
drift ﬁeld dataset at 6.0 kV/cm extraction ﬁeld is shown
in Figure 7 (bottom), where the observed events concen-
trate in regions of drift time <3 µs, as expected from
drift time estimation. The 37Ar spectrum obtained from
this dataset is shown in Figure 6 (bottom, light blue his-
togram): this K-shell 37Ar peak is observed above that
of the below-EG events; the peak shape is symmetric and
can be ﬁt well with a simple Gaussian. The peak posi-
tion and spread of the above-EG 37Ar events was then
used to constrain the ﬁt for the below-EG 37Ar event
spectrum. Figure 6 (top) includes a double-Gaussian ﬁt
to the K-shell 37Ar spectrum with the aforementioned
constraints, and the ﬁt result is in excellent agreement
with that evaluated with the drift time cut. Because of
the larger uncertainties in the double-Gaussian ﬁts than
that from the drift time analysis, only the results from
the drift time method is used for the rest of this analysis.
The numbers of detected electrons for both K-shell and
L-shell 37Ar decays at diﬀerent extraction electric ﬁelds,
calculated using SE calibrations from Figure 4, are shown
in Figure 8. For L-shell 37Ar decays, the peaks were sim-
ply ﬁtted with a single Gaussian function on top of an
exponential background, and the peak positions did not
exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerence for decays above and be-
low the EG. The average numbers of electrons for the
K-shell and L-shell 37Ar decays at ∼7.1 kV/cm extrac-
tion ﬁeld measured in this experiment are 138.4±2.9 and
21.2±0.5, respectively, consistent with that of 134.7±8.9
and 20.9±1.3 by the PIXeY experiment at similar drift
and extraction ﬁeld values [37]. The slight shift between
the LF data and the HF data that is observed in both
the K-shell result and the L-shell result can be largely

as illustrated in Figure 9. Therefore, the saturation fea-
tures in Figure 8 serve as a strong indication that close
to 100% absolute EEE value has been achieved in this
measurement, despite the measurement being relative in
nature.

cays as a function of extraction electric ﬁeld: LF K-shell (solid
triangles, red), LF L-shell (hollow triangles, red), HF K-shell
(solid squares, blue), and HF L-shell(hollow squares, blue).
The electric ﬁeld uncertainties mostly originate from the dif-
ferent grid conﬁgurations between the LF and HF measure-
ments, and the electron number uncertainties (∼1-3%) in-
clude that from the SE ﬁts and the 37Ar peak ﬁts.

attributed to systematic uncertainties in the estimated
drift/extraction ﬁeld values in the two diﬀerent hardware
conﬁgurations, as indicted by the horizontal error bars
(including both systematic and statistical uncertainties).
In addition, the purity levels of liquid xenon in these
two measurements may diﬀer slightly, leading to diﬀerent
losses of electrons during the drifting process before they
can be extracted. Using the scintillation-EL coincidence
for K-shell 37Ar decay events, we calculated the electron
lifetime values to estimate the electron loss to impurities,
and introduced an additional systematic uncertainty of
1% to account for the impurity variation.

V. DISCUSSIONS

In Figure 8, the number of detected electrons in the
gas phase increases rapidly with the applied extrac-
tion electric ﬁeld below 6 kV/cm for both K-shell and
L-shell 37Ar decays. At higher ﬁeld values, the de-
pendence becomes very mild. Particularly,
for ﬁeld
strengths of >7.5 kV/cm, the increase in the collected
electron number with the extraction ﬁeld is at the level
of <1%(kV/cm)−1. This value is smaller than the mea-
surement uncertainty at each data point, suggesting that
a saturation of the EEE may have ﬁnally been observed.
As discussed in Section II, the number of detected elec-
trons from mono-energetic sources, which is proportional
to the EEE at the liquid surface, would keep increasing
with the electron energy until 100% EEE is achieved.
The average energy of drifting electrons in liquid xenon,
as calcualted from electron transport models [23, 29], is
expected to increase monotonically with the applied elec-
tric ﬁeld over the ﬁeld range studied in this experiment,

FIG. 9. the calculated mean electron energy in liquid xenon as
a function of the extraction electric ﬁeld under two transport
models (red dashed curve [29] and blue dash-dot curve [23]),
in comparison with the estimated potential barrier height at
the liquid surface [7, 22]. The barrier height at zero electric
ﬁeld is assumed to be 0.67 eV for this illustration.

In the discussions hereafter, we assume the average
EEE value in the ﬁeld range of 7.5-10.4 kV/cm to be
100%, and then the EEE values at diﬀerent extraction
electric ﬁelds can be calcualted through a simple scaling.
Thanks to the excellent agreement between the K-shell
result and the L-shell result for both LF and HF mea-
surements, we summed the numbers of detected electrons
from the two decay modes for higher accuracy, and the
resulted EEE curve is shown in Figure 10. We comment
that the slight increase of the EEE above 7.5 kV/cm may
be explained by some systematic eﬀects that are not ac-
counted for in this analysis. For example, the electron
transparency of the EG and the electric ﬁeld leakage from
above the EG to below may both increase slightly with
the extraction electric ﬁeld, causing more electrons to be
observed in the measurements. Alternatively, it could be
a result of the low-energy tail of the electron energy dis-
tribution being slowly lifted to above the potential bar-
rier at the liquid surface. In this scenario, 100% abso-
lute EEE may only be achieved asymptotically at higher
electric ﬁeld values. Due to the falling tail of the heated
electron energy distribution we expect the EEE slope at
higher ﬁelds to be smaller than ∼1%/(kV/cm) if this hy-
pothesis were true. Therefore, the absolute 100% EEE–if
diﬀerent from the highest EEE value measured in this
work–should not deviate from this result by more than a
few percent. A measurement at even stronger extraction
ﬁeld, which may be achievable with an upgrade to this
experimental setup, can further clarify the situation.

Figure 10 also compares this EEE result with other
measurements in literature. Of all of these measure-
ments, this work covers the largest electric ﬁeld range of

ground will help us achieve a complete understanding
of the low-energy ionization-like background observed in
xenon-based dark matter experiments [16, 18, 19, 45]. If
a substantially lower background electron level can be
achieved, a compact detector at the order of ∼10 kg may
oﬀer compelling sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs and cer-
tain dark sector dark matter particles [46]. In addition,
such detector development may also enable the moni-
toring of reactor anti-neutrinos using compact noble liq-
uid TPCs [6] through the recently demonstrated coherent
elastic neutrino nucleus scattering process [47].

Lastly, this experimental result on the extraction of hot
electrons from liquid xenon into the gas phase under the
inﬂuence of electric ﬁeld also contributes to the studies
of hot electron transport in non-polar liquid and across
phase boundaries. Noble liquids such as xenon resemble
the simplest dense matter and disordered systems, elec-
tron dynamics in which have been the topic of continuing
studies in condensed matter physics [23, 26–32], plasma
physics [48], and laser developments [49].

VI. CONCLUSION

We report a new measurement of the eﬃciency of
extracting electrons from liquid xenon into gas over
a large range of extraction electric ﬁeld, which is a
key performance parameter for xenon-based dark matter
experiments. By demonstrating previously unattained
high voltage performance, we studied the EEE values
at the highest electric ﬁeld strength reported to date.
For the ﬁrst time, a strong evidence of EEE satura-
tion is observed over a large electric ﬁeld window of
7.5-10.4 kV/cm. Combining this observation with elec-
tron transport and emission models developed for liquid
xenon, we suggest that this relative EEE result may be
used to infer the absolute EEE scale. This result oﬀers
the most comprehensive electron extraction eﬃciency cal-
ibration for both existing and future xenon TPC exper-
iments. It also provides valuable information for xenon-
based experiments to obtain a better understanding of
their low electron background and thus improve their po-
tential sensitivity to low-energy dark matter interactions
and to reactor antineutrinos.

in PIXeY [17], <6.1 kV/cm in XENON100 [16], and
<4.3 kV/cm in Gushchin et al. [15]. This result agrees
with that of PIXeY, XENON100, and LUX [2] (indirect
method, Equation 1) at low ﬁeld values; at high ﬁelds, the
discrepancies with XENON100 and PIXeY are likely to
be the result of the diﬀerent scaling factors used when the
experimental results are reported. In the relative EEE
scale used in this work, the highest EEE value measured
in XENON100 corresponds to ∼92% eﬃciency, and that
in PIXeY corresponds to ∼96% eﬃciency. The Gushchin
experiment was designed to measure the absolute EEE
values, so it is not subject to such biases; but due to the
lack of details in [15] we do not attempt to resolve the
discrepancy.

The highest electric ﬁeld covered in this experiment
far exceeds that used in any existing or proposed xenon-
based dark matter experiments. With the observation
of an apparent EEE saturation and the excellent agree-
ment with other recent measurements, this work oﬀers
the most comprehensive calibration of EEE for dual-
phase xenon TPC experiments to date. Using the EEE
scale in Figure 10, ∼10-15% of ionization electrons were
left un-extracted in the XENON10 and XENON100 ex-
periments, to the contrary of the assumed ∼100% elec-
tron extraction; re-emission of these electrons can pos-
sibly explain the high observed background rates in the
charge-only dark matter searches [13, 14]. Characteri-
