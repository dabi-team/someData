Highlights from the NA61/SHINE experiment ∗

Received August 31, 2022

√

The NA61/SHINE experiment is a ﬁxed-target, broad acceptance facil-
ity at the CERN SPS. This contribution summarizes the most recent results
from the strong interactions NA61/SHINE programme and presents news
on the detector upgrade in preparation for the future data taking. The
strong interactions programme consists in a two-dimensional scan in beam
sN N from 5.1 to 17.3 GeV)
momentum (from 13A to 150A/158A GeV/c,
and system size (p + p, Be + Be, Ar + Sc, Xe + La reactions). The exper-
iment searches for the second-order critical end-point in the temperature
versus baryo-chemical potential phase diagram and studies the properties
of the onset of deconﬁnement discovered by its predecessor, NA49 at the
CERN SPS. The presented results include K/π multiplicity ratios as a
function of energy and system size, singly and multi-strange hadron produc-
tion in p + p reactions, multiplicity and net-charge ﬂuctuations measured
by higher order moments in p + p, Be + Be and Ar + Sc collisions, proton
and charged hadron intermittency in Ar + Sc and Pb + Pb reactions, HBT
measurements in Ar + Sc and collective electromagnetic eﬀects in Ar + Sc
collisions.

1. Introduction

The NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS owes its name (SPS
Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment) to a two-fold experimental programme.
On the one hand it conducts precise spectra measurements necessary for
cosmic ray and neutrino experiments. On the other, it investigates the onset
of deconﬁnement (OD) discovered by its predecessor, the NA49 experiment
at the CERN SPS [1] and searches for the critical point (CP) of the strongly
interacting matter.

The latter part of the programme, the strong interactions programme,
is the subject of the present paper. Within it, NA61/SHINE performed a
two-dimensional scan of system size and collision energy (Fig. 1 left). This

corresponds to scanning the phase diagram of the strongly interacting mat-
ter [2] (Fig. 1 right). It should be noted that due to the search for CP, which
involves ﬂuctuation variables, it is paramount to minimize system volume
ﬂuctuations and consequently the experiment focuses mainly on central col-
lisions. Hence the system size scan as opposed to the more usual centrality
scan.

2. Identiﬁed hadron spectra in Be + Be and Ar + Sc collisions

The published, new results on identiﬁed hadron spectra in Be + Be col-
lisions [3] and preliminary results on identiﬁed hadron spectra in Ar + Sc
collisions are discussed in detail in Ref. [4]. Figure 2 shows the summary of
these studies, the system size and energy dependence of the K+/π+ ratio
in midrapidity. A pronounced ‘horn’ in Pb + Pb/Au + Au collisions, associ-
ated with the OD [5], is clearly visible. There are, however, some unexpected
features in this dependence. First, p + p collisions do not follow a smooth
increase with energy, but rather an abrupt change of the trend at SPS ener-
gies. Second, Be + Be collisions feature similar K+/π+ ratio values to p + p,
while Ar + Sc collisions have no horn structure, but at the top SPS energy
converge to similar (large) ratio values as the Pb + Pb collisions. These two
observations can be attributed [6] respectively to two transitions between do-
mains of dominance of speciﬁc hadron production mechanisms: from hadron
resonances to strings when changing collision energy for small systems and
from strings to QGP ﬁreball (onset of ﬁreball) when changing system size
at large energies. These new NA61/SHINE data allow for the ﬁrst time to
sketch such a diagram of high-energy nuclear collisions and emphasize how
important the SPS energy range is.

3. Search for the critical point

Preliminary results on multiplicity ﬂuctuations of charged hadrons and
net-charge ﬂuctuations of charged hadrons, measured as the ratios of cumu-
lants [7] of the order up to 4, are shown respectively in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.
No structure indicating the CP is visible. While κ4/κ2 ratio is consistent
for all measured systems, interesting system size dependence is observed for
multiplicity κ2/κ1 and net-charge κ3/κ1 ratios. In the ﬁrst case there is an
increasing diﬀerence with collision energy between small systems (p + p and
Be + Be) and the Ar + Sc system. In the second case there is a diﬀerence
between Be + Be and other systems, again increasing with √
sN N . Work is
still ongoing to get more data points for Be + Be and Ar + Sc systems.

Another phenomenon frequently associated with the critical point of
strongly interacting matter is intermittency. In this analysis transverse mo-
mentum space in midrapidity is divided into cells in which particles are
counted to calculate scaled factorial moments Fr. For the system experi-
encing critical behaviour, the theory predicts [8] speciﬁc power-law scaling
of the moments as a function of the number of cells M : Fr(M ) ∼ M φr .
Figure 5 shows preliminary results on the proton intermittency in central
Ar + Sc and Pb + Pb collisions at respectively 150A GeV/c and 30A GeV/c
beam momenta. Figure 6 shows results for charged hadron intermittency in
central Pb + Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c beam momentum up to the fourth

scaled factorial moment. These analyses feature statistically independent
points and instead of the (px, py) cells, cumulative variables are used to re-
move dependence of the moments on the momentum distribution [9]. While
no indication of the critical point is visible in these analyses, a consider-
able progress is presently being accomplished in order to provide a more
advanced methodology, more sensitive to intermittency in the presence of
sizeable non-critical background [10].

The last CP-related results are symmetric Levy HBT correlations for
same-charge pion pairs in central Ar + Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c beam
momentum shown in Fig. 7. Here instead of a usual Gaussian source shape,
a more general Levy-stable distribution is used. Its parameter α describes

the shape of the source: for α = 2 the source is Gaussian, for α = 1 we have
a Cauchy distribution and the 3D Ising model with random external ﬁeld
predicts α = 0.5 ± 0.05 for a critical system. From the plot it is clear that
there is no indication of the CP for central Ar + Sc collisions at the top SPS
energy.

tromagnetic eﬀects in peripheral small systems (Ar + Sc collisions) at the

transverse momenta and pion rapidities close to the beam rapidity. Even at
intermediate centrality, i.e. with a small spectator system, the eﬀect is strong
enough to break isospin symmetry. Spectator-induced electromagnetic ef-
fects provide information on the space-time evolution of the system [11],
partially complementary to the femtoscopy.

5. New data on hadron spectra in p + p reactions

The new results on hadron spectra in p + p collisions are also discussed
in more detail in Ref. [4]. Here only two most recent results on rapidity
spectra of neutral kaons are presented in Fig. 9: the K∗(892)0 at 40 and
80 GeV/c beam momenta [12] compared to 158 GeV/c [13] and the K0
at
S
158 GeV/c compared to model predictions [14]. These data will on the one
hand serve as reference for future data from larger systems and on the other
hand serve as input to models, which struggle to describe the strangeness
production at SPS energies. The latter is visible in the right plot of Fig. 9.

6. Hardware upgrade and future measurements

All of the above results were possible thanks to the versatility of the
NA61/SHINE detector system. The spectrometer based on large-volume
time projection chambers (TPC) features large acceptance covering the full
forward hemisphere down to pT = 0. The latter is feasible due to the
ﬁxed-target setup and the magnetic ﬁeld oriented perpendicular to the beam
direction. During the CERN Long Shutdown 2, the whole system underwent
an upgrade including construction of a new Vertex Detector, new Beam

the data rate tenfold to 1 kHz.

The upgrade was necessary to perform the ﬁrst ever open charm mea-
surement at the SPS energies, which is the main goal of NA61/SHINE data
taking in years 2022–2024 (Fig. 1 left, grey boxes). The latter is motivated
by 3 questions:

• What is the mechanism of open charm production?

• How does the onset of deconﬁnement impact open charm production?

• How does the formation of quark-gluon plasma impact J/ψ produc-

tion?

In order to answer these questions it is necessary to know the full phase
space production of c¯c pairs, for which model predictions vary by 2 orders
of magnitude [15].
