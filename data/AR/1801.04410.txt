REDUCTION OF WIDE SUBCATEGORIES AND
RECOLLEMENTS

YINGYING ZHANG

Abstract. In this paper, we prove a reduction result on wide subcategories of
abelian categories which is similar to Calabi-Yau reduction, silting reduction and
τ -tilting reduction. More precisely, if an abelian category A admits a recollement
relative to abelian categories A′ and A′′, diagrammatically expressed by

A′ /

i∗

i∗

i!

/ A

j!

j∗

j∗

A′′

,

then the assignment C 7→ j∗(C) deﬁnes a bijection between wide subcategories in
A containing i∗(A′) and wide subcategories in A′′. Moreover, a wide subcategory
C of A containing i∗(A′) admits a new recollement relative to A′ and j∗(C) which
is induced from the original recollement.

1. Introduction

Wide subcategories of an abelian category are analogous to thick subcategories of
a triangulated category. This notion was introduced by Hovey in [Hov] and provides
a signiﬁcant interface between representation theory and combinatorics [IT]. Wide
subcategories are closely related to other important notions in representation theory,
such as semibricks [As], torsion classes [AIR, DIRRT, MS], silting complexes [AIR],
semistable subcategories [Y] and support τ -tilting modules [AIR]. Wide subcategories
of d-abelian categories was introduced and studied in [HJV].

Recollements of abelian categories were introduced by Beilinson, Bernstein and
Deligne in [BBD] for the construction of the category of perverse sheaves on a sin-
gular space, arising from recollements of triangulated categories. The notion of rec-
ollements is very useful in gluing and in reduction, see for example [AKL, BBD, C,
FP, LVY, P]. The main result of this paper is the following reduction result for wide
subcategories. This is similar to Calabi-Yau reduction in [IY2], silting reduction in
[AI] and [IY1], and reduction of support τ -tilting modules in [EJR] and [J].

Theorem 1.1. (Theorems 3.4 and 3.5) Let (A′, A, A′′, i∗, i∗, i!, j!, j∗, j∗) be a recolle-
ment (see Deﬁnition 2.4 for details). Then we have

(1) There is a bijection between wide subcategories in A containing i∗(A′) and

wide subcategories in A′′.

(2) Let C be a subcategory of A. If i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C(resp. i∗i!(C) ⊂ C), then C ⊂ A is

wide implies that i∗(C) (resp. i!(C))⊂ A′ is wide.

Note that i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C (resp.

i∗i!(C) ⊂ C) is weaker than i∗(A′) ⊂ C.

It is a
general interesting problem to construct a new recollement from a known one, see
for example [CL, LL, LW] for some study on this problem. As an application of
Theorem 1.1, we can construct a new recollement from the given one as follows:
Theorem 1.2. (Theorem 3.8) Let (A′, A, A′′, i∗, i∗, i!, j!, j∗, j∗) be a recollement of
abelian categories and C be a wide subcategory of A. If i∗(A′) ⊂ C, then the given rec-
ollement restricts to a new recollement of wide subcategories (A′, C, j∗(C), i∗, i∗, i!, j!, j∗, j∗).

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we collect some basic material that will be used later. We begin

this section by introducing the deﬁnition of wide subcategories.

Deﬁnition 2.1. [Hov, Deﬁnition 1.1] A full subcategory C of an abelian category A
is called wide if it is abelian and closed under extensions.

Note that when we say a full subcategory C is abelian, we mean that C is closed
under kernels and cokernels, more precisely, if f : M → N is a morphism of C, then
both the kernel and cokernel of f are also in C. We denote by wide A the set of wide
subcategories of A and wideC A the set of wide subcategories of A containing a given
subcategory C.

Example 2.2. [Hov] Let R be a ring.

(1) The empty subcategory, the zero subcategory and the entire category of R-

modules are all wide subcategories.

(2) The category of all R-modules of cardinality ≤ κ for some inﬁnite cardinal κ

is a wide subcategory.

(3) The category of ﬁnite-dimensional rational vector spaces, as a subcategory of

the category of abelian groups, is a wide subcategory.

For the convenience of the reader, we recall the deﬁnition of adjoint pairs [ARS]

before the deﬁnition of recollements.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let A and B be categories. An adjunction from A to B is a triple
hF, G, φi : A → B, where F is a functor from A to B, G is a functor from B to A,
and φ is a functor which assigns to each pair of objects A ∈ A, B ∈ B, a bijection
φ = φA,B : HomB(F A, B) ∼= HomA(A, GB) which is functorial in A and B. The
functor F is called a lef t adjoint of G, G is called a right adjoint of F , and the pair
(F, G) is called an adjoint pair from A to B.

Now we recall the deﬁnition of recollements of abelian categories, see for instance

[BBD, FP, K].

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let A, A′, A′′ be abelian categories. Then a recollement of A relative
to A′ and A′′ is given by the following diagram

3

A′ /

i∗

i∗

i!

/ A

j!

j∗

j∗

A′′

such that

(1) (i∗, i∗), (i∗, i!), (j!, j∗) and (j∗, j∗) are adjoint pairs;
(2) i∗, j! and j∗ are fully faithful functors;
(3) Imi∗ = Kerj∗.

Throughout this paper, we denote by (A′, A, A′′, i∗, i∗, i!, j!, j∗, j∗) a recollement of A
relative to A′ and A′′ as above.

Remark 2.5. (1) From Deﬁnition 2.4(1), it follows that i∗ and j∗ are both right
adjoint functors and left adjoint functors, therefore they are exact functors of abelian
categories.

(2) By Deﬁnition 2.4(2), one can assume that i∗i∗ ∼= id, i!i∗ ∼= id, j∗j!

∼= id and

j∗j∗ ∼= id in the deﬁnition of recollements.

(3) By [PV, Proposition 2.8], for any A ∈ A, there exist M ′ and N ′ in A′ such
that the units and counits of the adjunctions induce the following exact sequences
0 → i∗(M ′) → j!j∗(A) → A → i∗i∗(A) → 0,

0 → i∗i!(A) → A → j∗j∗(A) → i∗(N ′) → 0.

3. Recollements of wide subcategories

In this section we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
Throughout this section, let (A′, A, A′′, i∗, i∗, i!, j!, j∗, j∗) be a recollement of abelian

categories. We ﬁrst establish the following important result.

Lemma 3.1. Let C ∈ widei∗(A′) A. Then we have

(1) i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C, i∗i!(C) ⊂ C, j∗j∗(C) ⊂ C and j!j∗(C) ⊂ C.
(2) If j∗(C) ∈ j∗(C) for some C ∈ A, then C ∈ C.

Proof. (1) Since i∗(A′) ⊂ C, the inclusions i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C and i∗i!(C) ⊂ C are obvious.
For any C ∈ C ⊂ A, by Remark 2.5(3) there exist M ′, N ′ ∈ A and two exact
sequences

0 → i∗(M ′) → j!j∗(C) → C → i∗i∗(C) → 0,
0 → i∗i!(C) → C → j∗j∗(C) → i∗(N ′) → 0.
Since C is wide and i∗(A′) ⊂ C, it follows that j∗j∗(C) ∈ C and j!j∗(C) ∈ C. Therefore
j∗j∗(C) ⊂ C and j!j∗(C) ⊂ C.

(2) By Remark 2.5(3) there exists an exact sequence

0 → i∗(C ′)

f

→ j!j∗(C) → C → i∗i∗(C) → 0,

where C ′ ∈ A′. Since j∗(C) ∈ j∗(C), by (1) we have j!j∗(C) ∈ j!j∗(C) ⊂ C. Since
i∗(A′) ⊂ C, both i∗(C ′) and i∗i∗(C) are in C. Therefore f is a morphism in C, and
thus its cokernel Cokerf belongs to C because C is closed under cokernels. Now C,
being an extension of i∗i∗(C) by Cokerf , belongs to C, because C is closed under
(cid:3)
extensions.

Now we are in the position to prove Theorem 1.1.

Proposition 3.2. If C ∈ widei∗(A′) A, then j∗(C) ∈ wide A′′.
Proof. Assume that C is wide and i∗(A′) ⊂ C.

Step 1: j∗(C) is closed under kernels and cokernels. If f ′′ : M ′′ → N ′′ is a morphism
of j∗(C), we have to prove that Kerf ′′, Cokerf ′′ ∈ j∗(C). Applying the functor j∗ to
f ′′, we have the following exact sequence:

0 −→ Kerj∗(f ′′) −→ j∗(M ′′)

(3.1)
By Lemma 3.1(1), j∗j∗(C) ⊂ C, it follows that j∗(f ′′) is a morphism of C. Since C is
wide, Kerj∗(f ′′), Cokerj∗(f ′′) ∈ C. Then applying j∗ to (3.1), by Remark 2.5(1) and
(2) we have the following commutative diagram:

j∗(f ′′)
−→ j∗(N ′′) −→ Cokerj∗(f ′′) −→ 0.

Thus Kerf ′′ ∼= j∗(Kerj∗(f ′′)) ∈ j∗(C) and Cokerf ′′ ∼= j∗(Cokerj∗(f ′′)) ∈ j∗(C).

/ Cokerf ′′

/ M ′′

/ N ′′

Step 2: j∗(C) is closed under extensions. Let 0 → M ′′ f ′′

→ N ′′ → P ′′ → 0 be an
exact sequence in A′′ where M ′′, P ′′ ∈ j∗(C), we have to prove that N ′′ ∈ j∗(C).
Since j∗ is left exact, applying it to f ′′, we have the following exact sequence:

0 −→ j∗(M ′′)

(3.2)
By Lemma 3.1(1), j∗j∗(C) ⊂ C. It follows that j∗(M ′′) ∈ C. Then applying j∗ to
(3.2), by Remark 2.5(1) and (2) we have the following commutative diagram:

j∗(f ′′)
−→ j∗(N ′′) −→ Cokerj∗(f ′′) −→ 0.

By uniqueness of the cokernel, we know that P ′′ ∼= j∗(Cokerj∗(f ′′)) ∈ j∗(C). By
Lemma 3.1(2), Cokerj∗(f ′′) ∈ C. Since C is wide, we know that j∗(N ′′) ∈ C, which is
the middle term of the exact sequence (3.2). So N ′′ ∼= j∗j∗(N ′′) ∈ j∗(C).

We have ﬁnished to prove that j∗(C) is wide.

Conversely, starting from a wide subcategory of A′′ we can also ﬁnd a correspond-

ing wide subcategory of A.

Proposition 3.3. If W ∈ wide A′′, then C = {M ∈ A|j∗(M) ∈ W} ∈ widei∗(A′) A.

Proof. If f is a morphism of C, then j∗(f ) is a morphism of W by the deﬁnition
of C. Since W is wide, by Remark 2.5(1) we have j∗(Kerf ) ∼= Kerj∗(f ) ∈ W and
j∗(Cokerf ) ∼= Cokerj∗(f ) ∈ W. Thus Kerf and Cokerf are both in C.

Let 0 → M → N → P → 0 be an exact sequence in A where M, P ∈ C, we only
have to prove that N ∈ C. Since the functor j∗ is exact, we have the following exact
sequence:

0 −→ j∗(M) −→ j∗(N) −→ j∗(P ) −→ 0.
Note that j∗(M) ∈ W and j∗(P ) ∈ W, it follows that j∗(N) ∈ W since W is wide.
Thus N ∈ C. We conclude that C is a wide subcategory of A. It is obvious that
(cid:3)
i∗(A′) ⊂ C since j∗i∗ = 0.

In conclusion, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 3.4. There is a bijection

widei∗(A′) A ↔ wide A′′
given by widei∗(A′) A ∋ C 7→ j∗(C) ∈ wide A′′ and wide A′′ ∋ W 7→ C = {M ∈
A|j∗(M) ∈ W} ∈ widei∗(A′) A.

Proof. By Proposition 3.2 and Proposition 3.3, we only have to prove that the maps
above are inverse to each other. Let W ∈ wide A′′ and C = {M ∈ A|j∗(M) ∈ W}.
We claim that j∗(C) = W. Clearly j∗(C) ⊂ W. For any N ∈ W, N ∼= j∗j∗(N) ∈ W,
then j∗(N) ∈ C and therefore N ∈ j∗(C).

Conversely, let C ∈ widei∗(A′) A and C′ = {M ∈ A|j∗(M) ∈ j∗(C)} ∈ widei∗(A′) A.
We claim that C = C′. Clearly C ⊂ C′. For any M ∈ C′ ⊂ A, by Lemma 3.1(2) we
(cid:3)
have M ∈ C. We have ﬁnished to prove that C = C′.

Theorem 3.5. If C ⊂ A is wide and satisﬁes i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C(resp. i∗i!(C) ⊂ C)), then
i∗(C) (resp. i!(C))⊂ A′ is wide.

Proof. Assume that C ⊂ A is wide and satisﬁes i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C. We prove that i∗(C) ⊂ A′
is wide. The proof that i!(C) ⊂ A′ is wide when i∗i!(C) ⊂ C is similar.

Step 1: i∗(C) is closed under kernels and cokernels. If f ′ : M ′ → N ′ is a morphism
of i∗(C), we have to prove that Kerf ′, Cokerf ′ ∈ i∗(C). Applying the functor i∗ to
f ′, by Remark 2.5(1) we have the following exact sequence:

0 −→ i∗(Kerf ′) −→ i∗(M ′)

i∗(f ′)
−→ i∗(N ′) −→ i∗(Cokerf ′) −→ 0.

Note that i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C, it follows that i∗(f ′) is a morphism of C. Since C is wide, it
follows that i∗(Kerf ′) and i∗(Cokerf ′) belong to C. Thus Kerf ′ ∼= i∗i∗(Kerf ′) ∈ i∗(C)
and Cokerf ′ ∼= i∗i∗(Cokerf ′) ∈ i∗(C).

6

Step 2: i∗(C) is closed under extensions. Let 0 → M ′ → N ′ → P ′ → 0 be an exact
sequence in A′ where M ′, P ′ ∈ i∗(C), we have to prove that N ′ ∈ i∗(C). Applying
the functor i∗ to the above exact sequence, by Remark 2.5(1) we have the following
exact sequence:

0 −→ i∗(M ′) −→ i∗(N ′) −→ i∗(P ′) −→ 0.
Note that i∗i∗(C) ⊂ C, it follows that i∗(M ′), i∗(P ′) ∈ C. Since C is wide, i∗(N ′) ∈ C.
Thus N ′ ∼= i∗i∗(N ′) ∈ i∗(C).

We have ﬁnished to prove that i∗(C) is wide.

(cid:3)

The next result states that an adjoint pair of two categories can be restricted to

an adjoint pair of subcategories under an additional condition.

Proposition 3.6. Let (F, G) be an adjoint pair from A to B as in Deﬁnition
2.3. If C is a subcategory of A satisfying GF (C) ⊂ C, then the restricted functors
(F , G)(=(F |C, G|F (C))) is an adjoint pair from C to F (C).

Dually, if D is a subcategory of B satisfying F G(D) ⊂ D, then the restricted

functors (F , G)(=(F |G(D), G|D)) is an adjoint pair from G(D) to D.

Proof. For any C, D ∈ C, since (F, G) is an adjoint pair from A to B and GF (C) ⊂ C,
we have the following bijection:

HomF (C)(F C, F D) = HomB(F C, F D) ∼= HomA(C, GF D) = HomC(C, GF D),
which is functorial in C and D. Therefore (F , G) is an adjoint pair from to C to
(cid:3)
F (C).

Lemma 3.7. If i∗(A′) ⊂ C, then i∗(C) = i!(C) = A′.
Proof. In fact, if i∗(A′) ⊂ C, then A′ ∼= i∗i∗(A′) ⊂ i∗(C) and A′ ∼= i!i∗(A′) ⊂ i!(C).
(cid:3)
Thus i∗(C) = i!(C) = A′.

Now we give the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Theorem 3.8. If C ⊂ A is wide and satisﬁes i∗(A′) ⊂ C, then we obtain a recolle-
ment of wide subcategories as follows:

A′ /

i∗

i∗

i!

/ C

j!

j∗

j∗

j∗(C)

.

Proof. Of course, A′ is wide in A′. By Proposition 3.2, j∗(C) is wide in A′′ since C
is wide satisfying i∗(A′) ⊂ C.

Step 1: By Lemma 3.1(1), Propsition 3.6 and Lemma 3.7, we know that (i∗, i∗),

(i∗, i!), (j!, j∗) and (j∗, j∗) are adjoint pairs.

Step 2: By Deﬁnition 2.4(2), we know that i∗, j! and j∗ are fully faithful. So the

restriction functors i∗, j! and j∗ are also fully faithful.

Step 3: Imi∗ = Kerj∗ is obvious.
By the deﬁnition of recollements, we have done.

Here we give an easy example to illustrate the result.

Example 3.9. Let Λ be the path algebra over a ﬁeld K of the quiver 1 ← 2 → 3, of
type A3. If e is the idempotent e2 +e3, then as a right Λ-module Λ/ΛeΛ is isomorphic
to the simple module S1. In this case, there is a recollement as follows:
