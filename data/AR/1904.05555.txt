Abstract. We present new multicolour U BV RCIC photometric observations
of symbiotic stars, EG And, Z And, BF Cyg, CH Cyg, CI Cyg, V1016 Cyg,
V1329 Cyg, AG Dra, RS Oph, AG Peg, AX Per, and the newly discovered
(August 2018) symbiotic star HBHA 1704-05, we carried out during the pe-
riod from 2011.9 to 2018.75. Historical photographic and visual/V data were
collected for HBHA 1704-05, FG Ser and AE Ara, AR Pav, respectively. The
main aim of this paper is to present our original observations of symbiotic
stars and to describe the most interesting features of their light curves. For
example, periodic variations, rapid variability, minima, eclipses, outbursts, ap-
parent changes of the orbital period, etc. Our measurements were obtained
by the classical photoelectric photometry (till 2016.1) and the CCD photome-
try. Main results of our monitoring program are summarized and some speciﬁc
characteristics are pointed out for future investigation.1

1. Introduction

Symbiotic stars are the widest interacting binary systems that comprise a cool
giant as the donor and a white dwarf (WD) accreting from the giant’s wind
(Boyarchuk, 1967; Kenyon, 1986; M¨urset & Schmid, 1999). Their orbital periods
run from hundreds of days (S-type systems containing a normal giant) to a few
times 10–100 years (D-type systems containing a Mira variable)2. The former
case is given by our knowledge of the photometric and/or spectroscopic orbital

elements (e.g. Belczy´nski et al., 2000), while the latter is based on the long-
term spectroscopic observations and/or imaging (e.g. Parimucha et al., 2002;
Matthews & Karovska, 2006). However, they are, in general, unknown.

The accreting WD represents a strong source of the supersoft X-ray to UV ra-
diation (TWD >∼ 105 K, LWD ∼ 101 −104 L⊙) in the binary (Muerset et al., 1991;
Skopal, 2005; Skopal et al., 2009; Gonz´alez-Riestra et al., 2013; Ramsay et al.,
2016; Skopal et al., 2017b) that ionizes a fraction of the wind from the giant
giving rise to the nebular emission (e.g. Boyarchuk et al., 1966; Seaquist et al.,
1984; Kenyon & Webbink, 1984; Nussbaumer & Vogel, 1987). This conﬁgura-
tion represents the so-called quiescent phase of symbiotic binary, during which
the symbiotic system releases its energy approximately at a constant rate and
temperature. Corresponding optical light curves (LC) are characterized with
a well pronounced periodic wave-like variation along the orbit. Analyzes and
discussions of this fundamental variability in the optical continuum of symbi-
otic stars were provided by Boyarchuk et al. (1966), Belyakina (1970), Kenyon
(1986), Skopal (2001), Skopal (2008) and Jurdana-ˇSepi´c & Munari (2010).

Sometimes symbiotic stars experience unpredictable outbursts characterized
by ∼ 1−3 mag (multiple) brightening(s) in the optical, observed on the timescale
of a few months to years/decades (see e.g., historical LCs of FN Sgr, Z And,
AX Per of Brandi et al., 2005; Leibowitz & Formiggini, 2008; Skopal et al., 2011)
with signatures of a mass-outﬂow (e.g., Fernandez-Castro et al., 1995; Esipov
et al., 2000; Skopal, 2006; McKeever et al., 2011; Gonz´alez-Riestra et al., 2013).
Outbursts of symbiotic stars are called ‘Z And-type’ outbursts, as they were
observed in the past for a prototype of the class of symbiotic stars – Z And
(Kenyon, 1986). We name this stage as the active phase.

According to the basic composition of symbiotic binaries (see above), mod-
elling the spectral energy distribution conﬁrmed the presence of three basic
components of radiation in their spectrum – two stellar from the giant and the
hot component and one nebular from the ionized circumbinary environment.
Their contributions in the optical rival each other and are diﬀerent for diﬀerent
objects, and variable due to activity and/or the orbital phase (see Figs. 2–22 of
Skopal, 2005). During active phases, the ionization structure of symbiotic bina-
ries changes signiﬁcantly (e.g. Carikov´a & Skopal, 2012), which causes dramatic
changes of the LC proﬁles with respect to the wave-like variation during the
quiescence. In special cases, transient narrow minima (eclipses) can emerge in
the LC for systems with a high orbital inclination (e.g. Belyakina, 1991), whose
position and proﬁle is a function of the stage of the activity (Skopal, 1998).

With respect to the above mentioned principal behaviour of symbiotic stars,
their LCs bear a great deal of information about the location and physical
properties of the radiative sources in the system. Above all, the multicolour
photometry represents an important complement to spectroscopic observations
and those obtained at other wavelengths. Their monitoring also plays an impor-
tant role in discoveries of unpredictable outbursts of symbiotic stars.

In this paper, we present results of our long-term monitoring programme
of photometric observations of selected symbiotic stars, originally launched by
Hric & Skopal (1989). It continues its part XII (Skopal et al., 2007) and XIII
(Skopal et al., 2012) by collecting new data obtained during the period from
November, 2011 to December 2018. Their acquisition and reduction are intro-
duced in Sect. 2. Sect. 3 describes the most interesting features of the LCs that
deserve further investigation. Conclusions are found in Sect. 4.

2. Observations and data reduction

Our photometric measurements were carried out at diﬀerent observatories using
diﬀerent devices and techniques. Multicolour photometric measurements were
obtained mostly at the Star´a Lesn´a observatory (pavilions G1 and G2) oper-
ated by the Astronomical Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences using two
60 cm, f/12.5 Cassegrain telescopes and one 18 cm, f/10 Maksutov-Cassegrain
telescope. New observations cover the period between November 2011 and De-
cember 2018.

(i) In the pavilion G2, classical photoelectric U BV observations in the stan-
dard Johnson system were obtained by a single-channel photoelectric photome-
ter mounted in the Cassegrain focus of the 60 cm reﬂector (see Skopal et al.,
2004; Vaˇnko et al., 2014a,b, 2015, in detail). We performed these measurements
till February 2016, when they were completely replaced by the observations with
CCD detectors. Magnitudes obtained with photoelectric photometer were de-
termined using the comparison stars listed in Table 1 of Skopal et al. (2012).
Maximum internal uncertainty of these night-means (rms) is of a few times 0.01
in the B, V ﬁlters and up to ∼ 0.05 mag in the U passband.

(ii) CCD photometric measurements were obtained in the standard Johnson-
Cousins U BV RCIC system, using three diﬀerent CCD cameras. Until January
2016, one of the 60 cm telescope was equipped with Moravian Instruments G4-
9000 CCD camera (3056 × 3056 px, pixel size: 12µm × 12µm), for BV RCIC
photometry. Currently, we are using the FLI ML3041 CCD camera (2048 ×
2048 px, pixel size: 15µm × 15µm, scale: 0.4 arcsec/px, FoV: 14′ × 14′) mounted
at the 60 cm telescope in the G2 pavilion to measure U BV RCIC magnitudes,
and the SBIG ST10 MXE CCD camera (2184 × 1472 px, pixel size: 6.8µm ×
6.8µm) in the Cassegrain focus of the 18 cm telescope in the G1 pavilion for
BV RCIC photometric observations. As the 18 cm telescope is ﬁxed with the
60 cm one for the mid-resolution (R ∼ 11000) echelle spectroscopy, it is also
used to obtain simultaneous photometry for absolute ﬂux calibration of the
spectroscopic observations.

Standard reduction of the CCD images was done using the IRAF-package
software3. The corresponding magnitudes were obtained with the aid of the

comparison stars of Henden & Munari (2006), listed in Table 1. Each value
represents the average of individual measurements during a night. For the con-
version of the observed magnitudes to the standard U BV RCIC system, we used
transformation coeﬃcients determined from photometric measurements of M67
star cluster. We re-measure the system once a year, but also after each change
of instrumentation including coating the mirrors.

(iii) From 2016.9, some multicolour BV RCIC photometry was performed at
the private observatory in Liptovsk´a ˇStiavnica by one of us (M.V.) using the
35 cm, f/4.5 Newtonian reﬂector equipped with Moravian Instruments G2-1600
CCD camera (CCD chip: KAF 1603ME, 1536 × 1024 px, pixel size: 9 × 9 µm).
The CCD images were reduced with the MuniWin-package software4. Resulting
magnitudes agree with the values from G1/G2 stations (see point (ii)) within the
errors, which are in the range of 0.02 − 0.03 mag in the BV RCIC ﬁlters. Because
the camera has only a weak and unevenly sensitivity in the U passband, we
present U magnitudes only of those symbiotic stars, for which agreement with
our data is within ±0.05 mag.

(iv) Additional U BV RCIC observations were performed using the 50/70/172
cm Schmidt telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen, Bul-

garia. A CCD camera FLI PL16803 with the chip size 4096 × 4096 px, 73.80 ×
73.80 arcmin ﬁeld and the scale 1.08 arcsec/px was used. Some observations were
also carried out with the VersArray 1300 B CCD camera (1340×1300 px, pixel
size: 20 µm ×20 µm, scale: 0.258 arcsec/px) on the 2 m and 1.3 m telescopes.

Maximum internal uncertainties of our CCD measurements were in most
cases comparable to those determined for the photoelectric U BV photometry
(see the point (i) above). In the RC and IC passband the night-means (rms)
errors were .0.05 mag. However, in most cases the errors are given in tables
(see on-line data).

(v) The photographic magnitudes of FG Ser and HBHA 1704-05 were deter-
mined using the digitized plates from the archive of the Sternberg Astronomical
Institute of the Moscow University (SAI). The plates were obtained with the
40 cm astrograph at the SAI Crimean Observatory. To extract the LC of these
objects, we reprocessed the original scans using the latest version of the VaST-
package software5 featuring the improved photographic aperture photometry
calibration technique (Bacher et al., 2005; Sokolovsky et al., 2016).

(vi) In addition, visual magnitude estimates of symbiotic stars AE Ara and
AR Pav were performed at the Tetoora Observatory in Australia (R.S.) with the
55 cm, f/3.8 Dobsonian telescope, from 2010. Between 2007 and 2010, estimates
of these stars were carried out by Albert Jones6 at the Carter Observatory,
Wellington 1, New Zealand, using his private 32 cm, f/5 reﬂector. Comparing
visual estimates with independently obtained V magnitudes (e.g., from ASASSN
survey), we determined their uncertainties to ∼ 0.3 mag for AE Ara (see Figs. 7
and 6 here, and Fig. 3 of Skopal et al. (2007)). For AR Pav we found uncertain-
ties to be even smaller, being of ∼ 0.2 mag (Fig. 23 here and Figs. 1 and 10 in
Skopal et al. (2001a) and Skopal et al. (2007)).

Tables with data for individual objects are only available on-line at

3. Light curves of the measured objects

3.1. EG And

EG And is one of the brightest symbiotic stars. To date, no outburst was de-
tected during its observational history (Skopal, 1997; Jurdana-ˇSepi´c & Munari,
2010, and Fig. 1 here). It is an eclipsing binary consisting of M2.4 III giant and
a hot star with a relatively low temperature of 70 000 − 95 000 K in comparison
with other symbiotic stars (Oliversen et al., 1985; Kenyon & Fernandez-Castro,
1987; Muerset et al., 1991; Skopal, 2005). The orbital period was most recently
determined by Kenyon & Garcia (2016) to Porb = 483.3 ± 1.6 days from radial
velocities of the cool component derived from echelle spectra observed during

more than 20 years. Including their data to all the previously published, they
attained an average orbital period of Porb = 482.5 ± 1.3 days.

Although EG And persists in a quiescent phase, we can identify a few types of
light variability in it’s LC. Figure 2 shows a double-wave light variation along the
orbital motion with minima around times of the spectroscopic conjunctions of
the binary components. This variability dominates the light curve of EG And in
all passbands. The presence of the secondary minimum around the orbital phase
0.5 in the IC ﬁlter is conﬁrmed by the long-term photometry in the Johnson’s
I ﬁlter as published by Percy et al. (2001).

Based on modelling the B and V LCs of EG And, Wilson & Vaccaro (1997)
attributed the double-wave LC to the tidal distortion of the giant. On the other
hand, Skopal (2001) proposed a model, where a partially optically thick, non-
symmetrical symbiotic nebula can also generate the observed orbitally-related
double-wave light variation by producing diﬀerent contributions of its emission
into the line of sight at diﬀerent orbital phases. This interpretation does not
claim the Roche-ﬁlling giant, recently conﬁrmed by Kenyon & Garcia (2016).
Finally, we note that Jurdana-ˇSepi´c & Munari (2010) didn’t ﬁnd any ellipsoidal
variability in their photographic data obtained during 35 years of observations.
However, the accuracy of their estimates of 0.1 mag and the presence of addi-
tional ∼ 0.1 mag variation in B on the time scale of tens of days (see below)
could aﬀect the visibility of the secondary minimum.

The large scatter of data in all ﬁlters shown in the phase diagram (Fig. 2)
represents real light variations (Skopal, 1997; Skopal et al., 2012). In our data,
this variability is best evident in B and V after May 2017 (∼ JD ∼ 2 457 900,
Fig. 3). The peaks are separated by ∼ 40 days. Using Fourier analysis on the

Figure 3. A part of the B LC of EG And, where a light variation with peaks separated
by several tens of days is clearly recognized. The grey line represents a model including
periods: 241 (half of the Porb – black line), 39, 46, and 28 days (see text).

time interval between May 2017 and March 2018 we identiﬁed two periods of
∼ 39 and ∼ 46 days. Also, the wavelet analysis revealed a period with the highest
WWZ statistic of ∼ 42 days. Percy et al. (2001) identiﬁed a period of 29 days by
analyzing the long-term V RI photometry of EG And. Crowley (2006) suggested,
that the period of ∼ 28 days with a variation of ∼ 0.1 mag is consistent with
small radial pulsations of the red giant photosphere. Although we examined only
the short time interval, we found a ∼28 days period in the B data. When using
all our data in B together with those of Skopal (1997) and Skopal et al. (2012),
we identiﬁed a period of ∼ 29 days. It has, however, lower signiﬁcance than that
of 42 days, which we did not ﬁnd using all the data. The brightness of the star in
U ﬁlter was observed less frequently and these ”pulsations” are not so obvious.
In our data, we found only a period of ∼ 27 days after JD ∼ 2 457 900. The
light curve with U magnitudes shows more chaotic behaviour, with variation
up to ∼ 0.5 mag. The observed brightenings could be related to the enhanced
mass loss rate from the giant due to pulsations of the giant. The enhanced
mass loss from the giant increases the density of the circumstellar matter and
hence the accretion rate onto the WD. The enhanced accretion can increase the
luminosity of the WD, and thus also the nebular radiation, which dominates
the U passband (Crowley, 2006; Skopal, 2005; Skopal et al., 2012).

Finally, there is probably present a very long-period light variation on the
time-scale of several years. It is apparent mainly in the U brightness, which peaks
between the years 1986–1989 (Skopal, 1997) and 2004-2006 (Skopal et al., 2012).
This light variation has the highest amplitude in U (±0.1 mag) and lowest in

RC and IC band (±0.025 mag).

3.2. Z And

Z And is considered to be a prototype of the class of symbiotic stars. The bi-
nary consists of a late-type M4.5 III red giant and a WD accreting from the
giants wind on the 758-day orbit (e.g. Nussbaumer & Vogel, 1989; Fekel et al.,
2000a). The current active phase has begun in September 2000 (Skopal et al.,
2000a), being followed with a series of outbursts with the main optical maxima
in December 2000, July 2006, December 2009 and December 2011 (see Fig. 4).
At/after the 2006 and 2009 maxima, highly collimated bipolar jets were detected
as the satellite emission components to Hα and Hβ lines (Skopal & Pribulla,
2006; Skopal et al., 2018).

Our new photometry is shown in Fig. 4. After the major 2009 outburst, we
detected four new main peaks in the LC. The ﬁrst occurred in November 2011
(JDMax ∼ 2 455 887) with maximum U ∼ 8.3 mag). Then the brightness was
continuously fading until March 2013 (JDMin ∼ 2 456 353) to U ∼ 9.7 mag.
The next maximum occurred between February and May 2014 at U ∼ 9.1 mag.
In June 2016, the star’s brightness slightly increased to ∼ 9.6 mag, and then
declined to the lowest level at U ∼ 10.3 mag, in April 2017. In October 2017,
Z And started the recent most pronounced outburst since that in 2011. The
brightness steeply increased to the maximum of U ∼ 8.4 mag in April 2018,
following a decrease to the present (December 2018).

The proﬁles of the observed outbursts since 2011 are very similar. The steep
increase of the brightness, followed by a slower decline and separated from the
next increase with a standstill in the brightness. In April 2017, we observed a

brightness, close to the orbital phase ϕ ∼ 0, as observed in the LC of BF Cyg
(see Fig. 30). The RC and IC LCs show a double-wave light variation.

Our data supplement well those from the AAVSO database, whereby we can
detect a light variation with the period of ∼ 58 days, best visible in the V LC
(Fig. 5).

3.3. AE Ara

AE Ara was speciﬁed as a symbiotic star on the basis of its infrared colours by
Allen & Glass (1974). It is an S-type symbiotic star with the orbital inclination
of 51◦ (Fekel et al., 2010), thus no eclipses are observed in the LC. The orbital
period of 812 ± 2 days was determined by Miko lajewska et al. (2003) using the
visual photometry during the 1980s and 1990s decades. Using radial velocity
measurements from the near-IR spectrum obtained during 2001 – 2009, Fekel
et al. (2010) found the value of 803 ± 9 days.

The published photometric data consist mainly of visual estimates. They are
in good agreement with photometric V magnitudes published by Skopal et al.
(2007) and V magnitudes released as a part of the ASAS7 program (Pojmanski,
2002). According to the LC evolution, AE Ara was in quiescent phase until the
beginning of 2006, when the system entered a new active phase (see Fig. 3 of
Skopal et al., 2007, and Fig. 6 here).

Figure 6. The LC of AE Ara consisting of visual estimates from the AAVSO database
(grey dots), our data (black) and V magnitudes from ASAS database (green).

Here we present new visual observations from 2007 (see Sect. 2, point (vi)).
Figure 6 shows that AE Ara was in an active phase from 2006 to ∼2014 with the
maximum V ∼ 11 mag at the beginning of 2008 that was followed by a gradual
decrease throughout a few orbital cycles. Applying the Fourier analysis for the
AAVSO8 data, V magnitudes from ASAS and our measurements between March
2006 and July 2016, we estimated the orbital period of AE Ara to ∼ 860 days
(Fig. 7). To conﬁrm this result, we also used a diﬀerent approach. We ﬁtted the
data with a function

m(t) = A × e−γt

2

sin[(t − t0)2π/P ] + v1t + v2,

(1)

where the variation of the magnitude m(t) with time t in Julian days is described
by a sinus function with the phase shift t0 and the period P . In our approach,
the decrease of the amplitude A is given by a damping parameter γ and the
star’s brightness declines linearly with time, given by parameters v1 and v2.
The resulting ﬁt (Fig. 7) yields the period P = 850 ± 20 days and the 60%
decline in the amplitude variations from 2006.2 to 2016.6. During this time, the
brightness of the system decreased with a factor of ∼ 1.4. Our analysis suggests
that the orbital period indicated during the transition from the active to the
quiescent phase (2006.2 – 2016.6) is larger than that determined during the
quiescent phase by Miko lajewska et al. (2003) and that from radial velocities of
Fekel et al. (2010).

Analysis of the minima positions in the historical LCs of symbiotic stars
revealed apparent changes in their orbital periods that are systematic, depending
on the level of activity of symbiotic binary (Skopal, 1998). For example, after
the main 1895 outburst of BF Cyg the minima were separated with ∼770 days
along the decrease of the star’s brightness, which indicates a longer orbital

period than given by the spectroscopic orbit (757.2 days; see Fekel et al., 2001).
The nature of the larger apparent orbital period determined for AE Ara during
the brightness decline after the 2006 outburst will be probably the same as for
BF Cyg. Understanding of this very interesting eﬀect requires a more detailed
analysis, which is out of the scope of this paper.

3.4. BF Cyg

Observational history of the eclipsing symbiotic star BF Cyg began more than
120 years ago (Jacchia, 1941, and references therein). The main feature of the
LC is a very slow decrease in the brightness, from the ∼1894 nova-like outburst
to ∼1985, when the brightness in B decreased by more than 3 mag (see Fig. 1
of Skopal et al., 1997). Simultaneously, periodic or eruptive variations in the
star’s brightness were observed. The historical LC was analyzed by Leibowitz
& Formiggini (2006). They identiﬁed several periods in the optical LC. Beside
the orbital period Porb = 757.3 days, (Pucinskas, 1970; Fekel et al., 2001), they
indicated a 798.8-d period, which they attributed to the rotation of the giant. In

with the data published by Skopal et al. (2007, 2012), Yudin et al. (2005) and, for a
comparison, data from the AAVSO database (grey points).

addition, they showed that the most pronounced outbursts repeat every ∼ 6376
days, predicting a new outburst for 2007.

A new active phase began around the mid of 2006, reaching the peak in
September 2006 (Munari et al., 2006; Iijima, 2006; Skopal et al., 2007; McKeever
et al., 2011).

Figure 8 shows the multicolour LCs of BF Cyg from 1999 to our last ob-
servations in December 2018. The light variation after the 2006 outburst is
modulated by the orbital motion, showing broad minima around the inferior
conjunction of the giant (orbital phase ϕ = 0), similar to those observed during
quiescent phases. After the rapid descent to the eclipse in December 2013, the
LC changed in proﬁle. In 2014 and 2016 the minima were followed by a phase of a
relatively constant brightness until ϕ ∼ 0.4. It is of interest to note, that similar
light variation was observed also in the LC of AX Per and Z And (see Fig. 30).
During the 2014 eclipse, BF Cyg reached the lowest brightness since the deep
eclipse in 2007. Thereafter, the overall brightness of the system was gradually
increasing. The minima in 2014 (U ∼ 11.0), in 2016 (U ∼ 11.0) and in 2018
(U ∼ 10.4 mag) occurred ∼14, ∼17 and ∼20 days after the predicted inferior
conjunction of the giant, according to the ephemeris of Fekel et al. (2001). After
that we observed a steep increase of the brightness (bursts, see Skopal et al.,
2017a, for the 2016/2017 one), which peaked around ϕ ∼ 0.5. A similar proﬁle
of the light variation is present in all U BV RCIC ﬁlters, although in the IC ﬁlter
it is less evident. After the most recent minimum in 2018 (JDMin ∼ 2 458 230)
the brightness of BF Cyg steeply raised to U ∼ 9.7 mag at JD ∼ 2 458 360,
but consequently dropped to U ∼ 10 mag within ∼30 days as given by our last
measurement.

3.5. CH Cyg

The photometric variability of CH Cyg is probably the most intriguing from
all well-observed symbiotics. The light variations are observed on very diﬀerent
time-scales, from minutes to decades. It is believed that the rapid light varia-
tion (ﬂickering, ﬂares and bursts) and other types of stochastic variability are
connected with accretion phenomena in the system. Also possible pulsation of
both the cool giant and the hot component, orbital motion(s) in the system
of unknown composition (binary or triple star system?) and dust obscuration
events make the resulting light and its changes even more complex (e.g. Miko-
lajewska et al., 1988; Skopal et al., 1996; Iijima, 1998; Motta & Motta, 2000;
Corradi et al., 2001; Skopal et al., 2002; Sokoloski & Kenyon, 2003; Bondar’ &
Prokof’Eva, 2006; Biller et al., 2006; Taranova & Shenavrin, 2007; Bogdanov
& Taranova, 2008; Hinkle et al., 2009; Pedretti et al., 2009; Skopal et al., 2010;
Karovska et al., 2010; Sokoloski et al., 2010; Shugarov et al., 2012; Stoyanov
et al., 2012; Shugarov et al., 2015; Iijima, 2017; Kondratyeva et al., 2017; Mikay-
ilov et al., 2017; Stoyanov et al., 2018).

Our observations are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. After the June-December pe-
riod in 2006, when the LC showed a 2 mag decline of brightness in all colours
(Skopal et al., 2007), CH Cyg began to gradually increase its brightness. In
2009, a burst was detected simultaneously in the X-rays and the optical U, B
passbands (Mukai et al., 2009; Skopal et al., 2010). Similar bursts were later in-
dicated during October 2015, between February and May 2016 and in September
2016. All bursts were comparable in amplitude (∆U ∼ 1.7 mag; Fig. 10).

From ∼2015 we measured a &3 years lasting wave with maxima around
July-August 2015 (U ∼ 7 mag) and March-April 2018 (U ∼ 6.4 mag) and the
broad minimum at the end of 2016 with U ∼ 9.7 mag. Times of minima depend

on the colour. The largest diﬀerence of ∼ 190 days is between the minimum
in U (JD ∼ 2 457 620) and RC (JD 2 457 814) (Fig. 10), although the U LC is
rather complex during the second half of 2016. It is of interest to note that the
2018 maximum with U ∼ 6.2 mag was the highest one after the major 1977-1984
outburst (U ∼5 mag). The diﬀerent time of the maximum in RC and U BV ﬁlters
can be caused by the presence of a ∼ 95 day period easily recognized in B, V and
RC LCs (see Wallerstein et al., 2010). Further, we observed a sharp minimum
at JD ∼ 2 458 307 (U ∼ 8.8 mag) and then another decrease by ∼ 1 mag until
our last observation (see Fig. 10).

3.6. CI Cyg

Since September 2008, when CI Cyg underwent its last major outburst, the
return to the quiescent phase was interrupted only by two eruptions of lower
magnitude (Fig. 11). The ﬁrst one, disrupted by the eclipse, was described by
Skopal et al. (2012). The second one with two maxima around U = 10.5 mag
was observed during August-September, 2012. Since then, CI Cyg entered a
quiescent phase showing the typical brightness variation strongly modulated by
the orbital motion in all ﬁlters. A secondary minimum around the ϕ = 0.6 was
recognizable in the BV RCIC LCs (see Figs. 11 and 12).

According to the basic composition of symbiotic binaries (see Sect. 1), the
amplitude of such variability is wavelength dependent with ∆U > ∆B > ∆V >
∆RC > ∆IC. Fig. 12 shows that times of the recent wave-like minima are

shift seems to be a function of the colour. For the 2015 minimum, we deter-
mined the light minima by a simple parabolic ﬁt to Min(B)∼JD 2 457 237.2
and Min(V)∼JD 2 457 253.8. For the 2017 minimum, we found its timings at
Min(B)∼ JD 2 458 074.4 and Min(V)∼JD 2 458 088.4. During the last orbital
cycle, the LC in all ﬁlters is modulated by a light variation with the period of
∼ 73 days, which is most pronounced in the V ﬁlter (Fig. 12).

Since 2011 until our last observations, the overall brightness of CI Cyg has

been gradually decreasing with a rate of about 0.17 mag per year.

3.7. V1016 Cyg

V1016 Cyg underwent a nova-like outburst in 1964 (McCuskey, 1965) when
increased its brightness by ∼6 mag and reached the maximum in 1971. Since
then the brightness of the system slowly decreases most of the time. V1016 Cyg
is a D-type symbiotic star, with the oxygen-rich cool giant of the Mira-type
variable (Harvey, 1974; Schild et al., 1992). Arkhipova et al. (2015) reﬁned the
pulsation period of the giant to P = 465±5 days with the minimum at JDMin =
(2 444 003 ± 465) × E.

Here, we present U BV RCIC photometric observations of V1016 Cyg ob-
tained after March 2016 (Fig. 13). Pulsations of the giant are clearly apparent
in the IC ﬁlter. The last maximum was observed at JDMax ∼2 458 114 (Fig. 15).
We noticed certain shifts between the data observed in the same passband, but
using a diﬀerent telescope–camera–ﬁlter composition (Fig. 14). The shifts are

as high as ∼ 0.15 mag in B and V ﬁlter. This is probably caused by the eﬀect
usually observed in the LCs of novae during the ‘nebular phase’. The observed
ﬂux within a ﬁlter is dominated by nebular lines rather than by the underly-
ing continuum. When using the broadband photometric ﬁlters, some prominent
emission lines can be located close to the edge of the ﬁlter sensitivity. Critical
emission lines for this case are Hβ, O[III] 4959, 5007 ˚A, Hα and Paα, which
signiﬁcantly contribute to the ﬂuxes within B, V , RC and IC ﬁlters. Hence, a
small diﬀerence in the response curve of the ﬁlter used can result in some shifts
in the observed magnitude (e.g. Munari et al., 2015; Arkhipova et al., 2015).
Figure 14 demonstrates the eﬀect of strong nebular lines located near to the
short-wavelength edge of the V ﬁlter for V1016 Cyg.

In May 2015, Arkhipova et al. (2016a,b) observed a sudden decrease in the U
star’s brightness by about 0.17 mag. Our new observations conﬁrm this bright-
ness drop (see Fig. 13). At the same time (U − B) and (B − V ) colours became
redder (Fig. 16). This reddening could be partly caused by the variable circum-
stellar extinction due to the dust produced by the Mira variable and/or by the
change of the relative intensity of O[III] 4959 and 5007 ˚A emission lines, because
of their diﬀerent contribution to the B and V magnitude (see Arkhipova et al.,
2015). It is of interest to note that the decline in the U and B brightness during
2016 occurred around the time of the maximum brightness of the Mira variable
for the 465 days pulsation period (at JDMax ∼2 457 184, see Fig. 15).

(1997), JDMin = 2 427 687(±20) + (958.0 ± 1.8) × E. Denotation of points as in Fig. 1.

3.8. V1329 Cyg

V1329 Cyg was originally an inactive star of about 15 mag displaying ∼2 mag
deep eclipses (Stienon et al., 1974; Schild & Schmid, 1997). In 1964, V1329 Cyg
underwent a nova-like eruption when brightened by ∆mpg ∼3 mag, peaked
around 1968 at B ∼ 12.0 mag and developed a wave-like orbitally-related varia-
tion in its LC (Kohoutek, 1969; Arhipova & Mandel, 1973; Grygar et al., 1979).
This type of photometric variability – characteristic for symbiotic binaries dur-
ing quiescent phases – dominates the LC of V1329 Cyg to the present (e.g.
Skopal et al., 2012, and references therein).

Our new observations of V1329 Cyg are shown in Fig. 17, where they are
folded as a function of the orbital phase using the ephemeris of the pre-outburst
eclipses derived by Schild & Schmid (1997). The data cover the period from
November 19, 2009, to December 25, 2017, i.e. ∼3.1 orbits. Our measurements
conﬁrmed the presence of the orbitally-related light variability with a decreasing
amplitude to longer wavelengths: ∆U ∼ 1.6, ∆B ∼ 1.1, ∆V ∼ 0.9, ∆RC ∼ 0.7
and ∆IC ∼ 0.4 mag. Such the dependence is the result of the superposition of the
variable contribution from the nebula and a constant light from the red giant,
whose contribution increases to longer wavelengths. Figure 17 also shows that
the light minimum precedes the inferior conjunction of the giant by ∼ 0.1×Porb.
This eﬀect is caused by a prolate structure of the symbiotic nebula, whose
optically thick part is asymmetrically located with respect to the binary axis
during quiescent phases of symbiotic stars (see Skopal, 1998,

in detail).

3.9. AG Dra

AG Draconis is a well studied bright symbiotic star. It is a yellow symbiotic
binary comprising a K2 III giant (M¨urset & Schmid, 1999) and a WD accreting
from the giant’s wind on a 549-day orbit (Fekel et al., 2000a). There are no signs
of eclipses neither in the optical nor far-UV. Based on spectropolarimetric obser-
vations, Schmid & Schild (1997) derived the orbital inclination i = 60◦ ± 8◦.2.
The system undergoes occasional eruptions, lasting about 1-2 orbital cycles.
The stars brightness abruptly increases (∆U ∼2, ∆V ∼1 mag) showing multiple
maxima separated approximately by 400 days, while during quiescent phase the
LC shows typical wave-like orbitally-related modulation (e.g. Meinunger, 1979;
Skopal, 1998; Hric et al., 2014; Leedj¨arv et al., 2016, and references therein) The
historical LC was analyzed by Formiggini & Leibowitz (2012). They conﬁrmed
the ∼ 550 days orbital period and ∼ 355-day pulsation period of the K-type
giant, originally proposed by G´alis et al. (1999). Moreover, they reported also
∼ 373 days cycle between the outbursts and suggested ∼ 1160-day rotation
period of the giant.

Gonz´alez-Riestra et al. (1999) identiﬁed cool and hot outbursts diﬀering
in their Zanstra temperatures and the LC proﬁle. The former are more pro-
nounced (∆U ∼ 3 mag) lasting for 1–2 years, while the latter are weaker (∆U ∼
1−2 mag), single brightenings lasting for weeks to months. The last cool outburst
was observed during 2006–2007. The following quiescent phase was interrupted
with two small brightenings in March 2012 and May 2015 (U ∼ 10.6 mag; see
Fig. 18). Further, three bright bursts were observed in April 2016 (U ∼ 9.1 mag),
in May 2017 (U ∼ 10.3 mag) and in May 2018 (U ∼ 9.5 mag). A multi-peaked
proﬁle is apparent especially during the 2016 outburst, where it can be recog-

nized in U BV RC ﬁlters (Fig. 19).

It is of interest to note that the (U − B) colour practically did not change
during the last 2007 major outburst (see Fig. 20). The plateau part of the LC
occurred just between its two maxima. However, the LC proﬁle of the (B − V )
index resembles that of individual LCs. This plateau was not so evident during
the 1994 major outburst, while that during the 1981-82 outburst was better
comparable with the recent one. The plateau phases during major outbursts of
AG Dra are probably caused by a strong dominance of the nebular radiation
within the U and B passbands (e.g. Skopal, 2005). Then the star’s brightness
decline here is given by that in the nebular emission, which results in more or
less constant value of the (U − B) index. However, the brightness decrease in,
e.g., V ﬁlter is slower than in a bluer one, because of a signiﬁcant contribution
from the giant in V , and thus the B − V index is more similar to individual LC
proﬁle (see Fig. 20).

3.10. Draco C1

The symbiotic star Draco C1 is located in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy
(DdSg). Its symbiotic nature was discovered by Aaronson et al. (1982) within
a grating prism survey of the DdSg. The spectrum was characterized by strong
emission lines superposed on a carbon star continuum. Draco C1 has been stud-
ied photometrically for a long time (Munari, 1991; Skopal et al., 2007; Kine-

2012). Long-term photometry showed a variable LC with ∆V ∼0.1 mag and
periodicity around one year, which could be attributed to the orbitally-related
variation of quiescent symbiotic stars.

Our new BV RCIC measurements of Draco C1 cover the period between

November 6, 2010, and August 6, 2016.

3.11. RS Oph

RS Oph is a symbiotic recurrent nova with the orbital period Porb = 453.6 ± 0.4
days (Brandi et al., 2009). To the present, six eruptions were recorded in 1898,
1933, 1958, 1967, 1985 and the last one in 2006. Additional two outbursts prob-
ably happened in 1907 and 1954. For the former, only a post-eruption dip was
observed on archival photographic plates, because of the season gap in obser-
vations (Schaefer, 2004). Similarly, the latter was suggested by Oppenheimer
& Mattei (1993) according to the presence of such the dip and the fading tail
from the eruption, later conﬁrmed by Adamakis et al. (2011). The mean time
between the eruptions is ∼15 years. After the 2006 outburst, RS Oph remains
in a quiescent phase, during which the LC shows a sine-like variation with the
amplitude ∆V ∼ 0.3 mag and a period of ∼9.4 years (Fig. 21). A large scatter

tenths of a magnitude (e.g. Bruch, 1986; Worters et al., 2007; Zamanov et al.,
2015). Our measurements of the rapid light variability of RS Oph are showed in
Fig. 22. It is observed in all U BV RCIC ﬁlters having the amplitude decreasing
with increasing wavelength, because of increasing constant contribution from
the giant in longer wavelengths.

3.12. AR Pav

AR Pav is eclipsing symbiotic binary with the orbital period of 605 days (Mayall
& Shapley, 1937). It consists of an M5 III giant with a mass of ∼2 M⊙ (M¨urset &
Schmid, 1999). According to the observed variations in the UV/optical contin-
uum (e.g. Schild et al., 2001; Skopal et al., 2000b), the hot component is highly
variable in brightness, size and the geometry as suggested by very diﬀerent
proﬁles of minima – eclipses (Bruch et al., 1994; Skopal et al., 2000b, 2001a).

Photographic magnitudes of AR Pav were recorded on Harvard chart plates
since 1889 (Mayall & Shapley, 1937). Monitoring this star during 1889-1937,
the authors classiﬁed it as an eclipsing binary of the P Cyg type with an orbital
period of 605 days. Comparing consecutive reﬁnements of the orbital period
(see Andrews, 1974; Bruch et al., 1994), complemented with new, 1985-1999,
observations, Skopal et al. (2000b) found a decreasing trend of the orbital period.
The following observations (see Skopal et al., 2001a, 2004) supported this result
until the period felt to the value of 602.8 ± 0.3 days as determined from the
minima (66), (67) and (68) (Figs. 23 and 24). The period between Min(69) and
Min(70), however, raised up to 607.3 ± 2.1 days (Skopal et al., 2007). Authors
ascribed this diﬀerence to a strongly variable size, geometry and radiation of

In this paper, we present our (A.J., R.S.) new visual magnitude estimates,
which are in good agreement with photoelectric V magnitudes (see Skopal et al.,
2000b, 2001a, 2004, 2007, and Fig. 23 here). We determined times of new minima
between the epoch 71 and 78 using one or several methods (parabolic ﬁt, tracing
paper method, Kwee and van Woerden method, sliding integration). Minimum
at E = 73 was not determined, because of insuﬃcient data (Fig. 24). Our times
of minima (eclipses) together with those published in the literature are listed in
Table 2. They correspond to linear ephemeris

JDMin = 2 411 264.4(±1.7) + (604.47 ± 0.03) × E.

(2)

Residuals between the observed and predicted times of minima (eclipses) are
shown in Fig. 25. The O − C diagram indicates real systematic variation in the
minima timing. In general, this can be caused by variable mass transfer and
mass accretion resulting in variable size and shape of the eclipsing object, and
thus in a variation of times of the light minima.

During the higher level of the activity, the LC of AR Pav resembles that of
AX Per. However, the maximum light occurs usually around the orbital phase

ϕ ∼ 0.25 and not during the superior conjunction of the giant (Fig. 30). After
1998, AR Pav reduced its out-of-eclipse activity to only three episodes of the
star’s brightening; in 2002, 2013 and 2014 (see Figs. 23 and 24). The ﬂat LC
proﬁle between eclipses is observed from ∼2016.5 to date.

3.13. AG Peg

AG Peg is a symbiotic binary comprising a M3 III giant (Kenyon & Fernandez-
Castro, 1987) and a WD on an 818-d orbit (e.g. Fekel et al., 2000b). This system
is known as the slowest nova ever recorded (Kenyon et al., 1993). Its nova-like
outburst began during 1850 (Lundmark, 1921) when it rose in brightness from
∼ 9 to a maximum of ∼ 6 mag around 1885. Afterwards, AG Peg followed a
gradual decline to around 1997 (Boyarchuk, 1967; Kenyon et al., 2001). Then
AG Peg entered a quiescent phase with a typical orbitally-related wave-like light
variations with the amplitude ∆U ∼ 1.4 mag around the mean of 9.7 mag until
June 2015, when erupted again showing a Z And-type outburst (Fig. 26 here,
Fig. 1 of Skopal et al., 2017b, and references therein).

The 2015 outburst was ﬁrst reported by Waagen (2015). According to our
multicolour photometry (Fig. 26 here and Fig. 2 of Skopal et al., 2017b), the
outburst started around June 5, 2015 (JD∼ 2 457 177.6 ± 3.3) at B = 9.55 ±
0.07 mag and V = 8.45 ± 0.06 mag, reaching a maximum around June 30, 2015
(JD∼ 2 457 203.5 ± 2.0) at B = 7.68 ± 0.05 mag and V = 7.0 ± 0.1 mag. After
a gradual decline, a sudden re-brightening occurred on October 8, 2015 (JD∼
2 457 304.0±0.5) with a rise in U , B and V by ∼1, ∼0.7 and 0.5 mag, respectively.
In contrast to the ﬁrst maximum, the secondary one was followed by a plateau
phase until November 24, 2015, when the brightness began to decrease gradually.

Figure 27. Multicolour LCs after the 2015 outburst demonstrating transition of
AG Peg to quiescent phase. Dashed curves are quadratic functions, vertical lines repre-
sents orbital phase 0 (JD 2 457 801.9) and 0.5 (JD 2 458 211.0) and short vertical bars
mark corresponding minimum and maximum in U .

From August 2016 to the end of our observations (December 2018), the
LCs developed a wave, signalizing that AG Peg returned to a quiescent phase
(see Figs. 26 and 27). The shape of the U LC could be compared to quadratic
functions, which aid us to determine its extrema. The minimum and maximum
occurred at U ∼ 9.8 and ∼ 9.1 at the orbital phase ϕ ∼ 0.01 and ∼ 0.4,
respectively.

The brightness, the short timescale and the multiple peaks of the 2015 out-
burst refer to a diﬀerent type of outburst in comparison with the event in the
mid of 19th century. It was shown that the recent outburst was of a Z And-type
and that AG Peg obviously entered a new era of its evolution (Tomov et al.,
2016; Ramsay et al., 2016; Skopal et al., 2017b).

3.14. AX Per

AX Per is an eclipsing binary with the orbital period of ∼ 680 days (e.g. Skopal,
1991; Mikolajewska & Kenyon, 1992). The last quiescent phase that lasted from
1995 was interrupted by the ∆U ∼ 0.5 mag ﬂare in July 2007 followed with rapid

Our new photometric observations cover nearly four orbital cycles during a
high level of the star activity. A wave-like proﬁle in all colours with the am-
plitude of ∼ 2 mag are typical for each cycle (Figs. 28 and 29). It is of interest
to note that such characteristics can be recognized also in LCs of other active

symbiotic binaries. Figure 30 shows a comparison for AX Per, BF Cyg, Z And
and AR Pav. The light minimum is always observed around the inferior con-
junction of the giant, i.e. at the orbital phase ϕ ∼ 0, and the maximum light
around ϕ ∼ 0.5, when the active object is in front.

During the recent active phase, the minima – eclipses diﬀer signiﬁcantly
from those observed during previous active phases (see Fig. 2 of Skopal et al.,
2011). For example, the eclipse measured in March 2015 has a narrow, symmet-
ric V-shaped proﬁle in B and V with the minimum at JDMin ∼ 2 457 090.8,
while in U the LC is rather ﬂat. The following ‘eclipse’ from December 2016
(JDMin ∼ 2 457 743) is much broader and asymmetric in B, V and RC and
even ﬂatter in U , lasting from ϕ ∼ 0.9 to ∼ 1.2 (Fig. 29). We note here that
a very similar eclipse proﬁle was observed between 1958 and 1972 (Fig. 31),
when AX Per was in quiescent phase (Myalkovskij, 1977; Skopal et al., 2001b).

Figure 31. A comparison between the shape of the 2016 eclipse during the cur-
rent active phase and eclipses during the 1958-1972 quiescent period (data are from
Myalkovskij, 1977).

According to V , RC and IC LCs, the last observed minimum started in August
2018 (ϕ ∼ 0.86) showing a broad descending branch. Although our observations
end before the predicted eclipse time, it seems that the light minimum precedes
this position (Fig. 29). In general, the LC proﬁle changes from cycle to cycle
and is dependent on the colour. Such the behaviour reﬂects complex and vari-
able sources of radiation around the WD as well as within the circumbinary
environment.

3.15. FG Ser

Variability of the symbiotic star FG Ser was discovered by Hoﬀmeister (1968).
The star underwent an outburst in 1988 when its brightness increased by ∆B ∼
3.5 mag and peaked at B ∼ 10 on July 4, 1988 (Munari & Iijima, 1988). The
next monitoring of the star’s brightness showed multiple maxima and min-
ima - eclipses (see Munari et al., 1995, and Fig. 32 here). Using the timing of
three eclipses observed during 1989 – 1993 the authors determined the eclipse
ephemeris as JDEcl. = 2 448 492(±4) + (658 ± 4) × E.

Figure 32. Top: As in Fig. 1, but for FG Ser. The vertical lines represent times of
minima according to Eq. (3). The ﬁgure displays our photographic magnitudes from
archives, data published by Kurochkin (1993) (shifted by -0.2 mag) and photographic,
photoelectric and visual data of Munari et al. (1992, 1995) (other colours). Compared
are visual estimates from AAVSO (grey). Bottom: phase diagram of mpg magnitudes
during quiescent phase (left; JD < 2 447 000) and its comparison with B measurements
from the 1988-94 active phase (right).

During the quiescent phase, prior to the 1988 outburst, Kurochkin (1993)
determined the ephemeris for regular brightness variations (B = 13–14.5) to
JDMin = 2 446 590.9 + 630 × E using the photographic plates from the Stern-
berg Astronomical Institute archive (SAI; 1949-1987). He also determined the
ephemeris of the secondary minimum, which is observed at the phase ϕ ∼ 0.45
with the depth of ∼0.5 mag. Using the same archive of photo-plates, but from
1901, the data of Munari et al. (1992, 1995) and new photometric observations,
Shugarov et al. (2014) rectiﬁed the minima ephemeris to

JDMin = 2 443 452(±7) + (629.4 ± 1.0) × E

(3)

For the purpose of this paper, we remeasured magnitudes of FG Ser on pho-
tographic plates of the SAI archive (1955–1995; 256 plates) and the Asiago
archive (1968–1994; 41 plates). Our data are plotted together with those from

literature in Fig. 32. During the quiescent phase (JD < 2 447 000), their phase
diagram with the ephemeris (3) shows typical wave-like orbitally-related varia-
tion with ∆mpg ∼ 1.5 mag, broad minimum around the inferior conjunction of
the giant and a shallow ∼0.3 mag deep secondary minimum at ϕ ∼ 0.4. During
the active phase (1988-94), the minimum (eclipse) became narrower and shifted
its position after that from the quiescent phase by ∼ 0.05 × Porb (bottom right
panel of the ﬁgure), which prolongs the minima separation during the transi-
tion from quiescence to activity and during the decline from the outburst. This
eﬀect of apparent changes of orbital periods in symbiotic binaries was revealed
by Skopal (1998). Here, we indicated this eﬀect also for AE Ara (see Sect. 3.3).

3.16. HBHA 1704-05

The star HBHA 1704-05 was originally classiﬁed as an emission-line star (Ko-
houtek & Wehmeyer, 1999). On the basis of The All Sky Automated Sur-
vey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), the object was catalogued in the VSX as a
semi-regular variable with a periodicity around 418 days. On August 11, 2018,
Munari et al. (2018) reported that HBHA 1704-05 is coincident with the star
TCP J19544251+1722281 (ASASSN-V J195442.95+172212.6), which bright-
ened from V = 12.0 on July 31.945, 2018 to V = 10.7 on August 8.938, 2018,
showing characteristics of a symbiotic star in outburst.9 In the spectrum, they
found features of an M-type giant, a strong nebular continuum with superposed
emission lines of highly ionized elements (e.g., He II 4686 ˚A and [Ne V] 3426 ˚A),
conﬁrming the nature of HBHA 1704-05 as a symbiotic star in outburst. Photo-
metric and spectroscopic monitoring of HBHA 1704-05 during the ﬁrst month
of its outburst was presented by Skopal et al. (2019).

M. Seker´aˇs et al.

We started to monitor HBHA 1704-05 on August 12, 2018, just after the
discovery of its outburst. To obtain absolute values of its U BV RCIC magnitudes
we used standard stars ’120’ and ’123’ as indicated on the AAVSO chart and
the check star C = TYC 1620-2479 (α2000 = 19h54m55s, δ2000 = +17◦23′36′′).
Using the standard stars α, ”b”, ”c” in the ﬁeld of PU Vul and ”a”, ”b”, ”c”
in the ﬁeld of HM Sge (see charts of Henden & Munari, 2006), we determined
the U BV RCIC magnitudes of the standard stars in the ﬁeld of HBHA 1704-05.
Resulting magnitudes represent mean values with rms errors obtained during 5
nights (see Table 1).

Our photometry of HBHA 1704-05 is depicted in Fig. 33. The right panel of
the ﬁgure shows our multicolour CCD photometry during the current outburst.
The LCs show a gradual decline, steepness of which depends on the colour. From
the August’s 2018 maximum to our last measurements during February 2019,
the star’s brightness decreased by ∼2.6, ∼2.0, ∼1.5, ∼1.1 and ∼0.6 mag in the
U , B, V , RC and IC ﬁlter, respectively. We also measured photographic magni-
tudes on the plates collected in the Moscow’s photographic plates archive of the
Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow State University. These measure-
ments revealed another 2-mag outburst lasting from 1968 to ∼1975 (left panel of
the ﬁgure). A detailed analysis of LCs together with spectroscopic observations
of HBHA 1704-05 is planned for another publication.

4. Conclusions

In this paper, we present new multicolour long-term photometry of selected
symbiotic stars. Main results of our monitoring program can be summarized as
follows.

EG And persists in a quiescent phase. Our observations conﬁrmed a double
wave variation along the orbit in all U BV RCIC LCs. We also detected several
light variations, with the most signiﬁcant period around 28 days in the B LC.
Z And continues its active phase that started during September 2000. The
amplitude of the brightness peaks, which appeared around ϕ = 0.5 was gradu-
ally decreasing from U ∼ 8.3 in November 2011, ∼ 9.1 between February and
May 2014 to ∼ 9.6 mag in June 2016. The recent outburst began in October
2017, peaking at U ∼ 8.5 mag in April 2018. We also indicated a periodic light
variation with a ∼ 58-day period, visible in our U BV data.

AE Ara came to quiescent phase from around 2016. During its recent active
phase, from 2006 to 2016, we indicated a period of 850–860 days, which is
distinctive larger than its orbital period of 812 ± 2 days from light variations
during preceding quiescence or 803 ± 9 days from radial velocities. Such an
apparent change in the orbital period is caused by the change of the ionization
structure of the binary during quiescent and active phase (see Skopal, 1998).

BF Cyg remains at a high level of activity since its major outburst in 2006.
The overall star’s brightness was gradually declining until the eclipse position in

Photometry of Symbiotic Stars - XIV

55

2014, when the trend turned into the opposite way, with the increasing delay of
the minima position. During 2014, 2016 and 2018 the light minimum delayed by
∼14, ∼17 and ∼20 days after the inferior conjunction of the giant. The recent
2018-minimum (JDMin ∼ 2 458 230) was followed by a ∼ 0.3 mag brightening
peaked at U ∼ 9.7 mag on JDMax ∼ 2 458 360.

CH Cyg continues its active phase showing extremely complex photometric
variability. Its brightness was gradually increasing to 2015 when reached a max-
imum of U ∼ 7 mag. During the following descending part of the U B(V ) LCs
CH Cyg underwent three bursts with a comparable amplitude of U ∼ 1.7 mag.
During 2016, the light minima were shifted with increasing wavelength. Then
CH Cyg reached its maximum at U ∼ 6.4 mag during the ﬁrst half of 2018, being
followed with a sharp minimim in May 2018 and continuing a ∼ 2 mag decrease
in U by the end of 2018 (see Fig. 10).

CI Cyg experienced its last activity in the form of a double-peaked burst at
the end of 2012. Then entered a quiescent phase showing pronounced orbitally-
related light variation in the LCs. The recent broad minima in 2015 and 2017
diﬀer in their position and proﬁle for diﬀerent colours. Secondary minima around
ϕ ∼0.6 are present in BV RCIC LCs. A ∼ 73 days light variation can be recog-
nized in the V LC (see Figs. 12 and 11).

V1016 Cyg continued a slow brightness decline in U BV RC LCs by a few
times 0.1 mag during our observing period (from March 2016), whereas the IC
LC reﬂects pulsations of the Mira-type giant with ∆IC ∼0.7 mag. A sudden drop
in the U magnitude by ∼ 0.17 mag was measured around 2015.4 (see Fig. 15),
conﬁrming the previous ﬁnding by Arkhipova et al. (2016a,b). A decrease in the
U − B and B − V colours (Fig. 16) can be in part caused by the overall star’s
brightness decline and a ﬂux decrease of strong emission lines contributing to
V and B passbands.

V1329 Cyg persists in quiescent phase showing well pronounced orbitally-
related light variation with a decreasing amplitude at longer wavelengths. Their
minima precede the inferior conjunction of the giant by ∼ 0.1 × Porb (Fig. 17).
AG Dra continued its quasi-quiescent phase, during which the wave-like
variability is occasionally interrupted by short-lasting (.3 months) bursts with
∆U < 2 mag. Bright bursts usually show a multi-peaked structure (see Figs. 18
and 19). We noticed a rather constant U − B colour during the last 2006-08
major outburst, while the B − V index does not show such feature. Similar
plateau in the U − B LC was probably present also during the 1980-82 and
1994-95 major outbursts (see Fig. 20).

RS Oph persists at the stage between its recurrent outbursts. The BV RCIC
LCs from the last 2006 eruption to the present suggest a smooth variation with
the amplitude ∆V ∼ 0.3 mag and a period of ∼9.4 years (Fig. 21). Rapid vari-
ability is detected in all ﬁlters. High-cadence measurements in B demonstrates
a stochastic variability with ∆B ∼ 0.5 mag on the time-scale of hours and
∆B ∼ 0.05 − 0.1 mag on the time-scale of minutes (Fig. 22).

M. Seker´aˇs et al.

AR Pav reduced its out-of-eclipse activity from around 2004, showing only
two ∼ 0.5 mag brightenings in 2013 and 2014 (Fig. 23). We determined positions
of new minima from the epoch 71 to 78. All the available minima (1896.3 –
2018.8, Table2) determine the linear ephemeris, JDMin = 2 411 264.4(±1.7) +
(604.47 ± 0.03) × E. The corresponding O − C diagram indicates real systematic
variation in the minima timing (Fig. 25).

AG Peg underwent its ﬁrst Z And-type outburst in June 2015, after 165
years from its nova-like outburst in 1850 (Fig. 26). This change indicates the
beginning of a new era in the AG Peg evolution. After about 1 year AG Peg
came to a quiescent phase.

AX Per persists in a low-level active stage from about 2007. The LC proﬁle
varies from cycle to cycle and depends on the colour. For example, in 2016,
the maximum in U preceded those in other ﬁlters by ∼ 48 days, while in 2017,
maxima in U and B occurred at the same time, around ϕ = 0.4. The RC LC
shows secondary minima around ϕ = 0.45.

FG Ser was in quiescent phase from 1901 to 1987 as documented by re-
measuring its archival photographic measurements. We determined a new ephemeris
for its minima times, JDMin = 2 443 452(±7) + (629.4 ± 1.0) × E. During the
active phase (1988-94), the minimum (eclipse) occurred by ∼ 0.05 × Porb after
the minima positions from quiescence.

HBHA 1704-05 is the newly (August 9, 2018) discovered symbiotic star
in outburst. Our U BV RCIC photometry shows that the current outburst is of
Z And-type. By inspection of the Moscow’s archive of photographic plates, we
revealed another 2-mag-outburst of HBHA 1704-05 in 1968.
