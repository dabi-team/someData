COHEN-MACAULAY DIFFERENTIAL GRADED MODULES
AND NEGATIVE CALABI-YAU CONFIGURATIONS

HAIBO JIN

Abstract. In this paper, we introduce the class of Cohen-Macaulay (=CM) dg (=diﬀerential
graded) modules over Gorenstein dg algebras and study their basic properties. We show that
the category of CM dg modules forms a Frobenius extriangulated category,
in the sense of
Nakaoka and Palu, and it admits almost split extensions. We also study representation-ﬁnite
d-self-injective dg algebras A in detail for some positive integer d. In particular, we classify the
Auslander-Reiten (=AR) quivers of CM A for a large class of d-self-injective dg algebras A in
terms of (−d)-Calabi-Yau (=CY) conﬁgurations, which are Riedtmann’s conﬁgurations for the
case d = 1. For any given (−d)-CY conﬁguration C, we show there exists a d-self-injective dg
algebra A, such that the AR quiver of CMA is given by C. For type An, by using a bijection
between (−d)-CY conﬁgurations and certain purely combinatorial objects which we call maximal
d-Brauer relations given by Coelho Sim˜oes, we construct such A through a Brauer tree dg algebra.

0. Introduction

The notion of Cohen-Macaulay (CM) modules is classical in commutative algebra [Ma, BH],
and has natural generalizations for non-commutative algebras [Bu, H2, IW], often called Goren-
stein projective modules [ABr, C, EJ]. The category of CM modules has been studied by many
researchers in representation theory (see, for example, [CR, Yo, Si, LW]). On the other hand, the
derived categories of diﬀerential graded (dg) categories introduced by Bondal-Kapranov [BK] and
Keller [Ke1, Ke3] is an active subject appearing in various areas of mathematics [Mi, T, Ye2].
Among others, we refer to [An, Jo1, Jo2, KaY2, Schm] for the representation theory of dg cate-
gories.

In this paper, we introduce Cohen-Macaulay dg modules over dg algebras and develop their
representation theory to build a connection between these two subjects. One of the main properties
of the category of Cohen-Macaulay dg modules is that it has a structure of extriangulated category
and the stable category is equivalent to the singularity category, which is an analogue of Buchweitz’s
equivalence. Moreover, it admits almost split extensions and we can study it by Auslander-Reiten

theory.
In fact, there are many nice dg algebras (including those given in this paper), whose
categories of Cohen-Macaulay dg modules can be well understood, while the derived categories of
dg algebras are usually wild and it is hopeless to classify all the indecomposable objects.

To make everything works well, we need to add some restrictions on dg algebras. More precisely,

we work on dg algebras A over a ﬁeld k satisfying the following assumptions.

Assumption 0.1. (1) A is non-positive, i.e. Hi(A) = 0 for i > 0 (without loss of generality, we

may assume Ai = 0 for i > 0, see Section 1.3);

(2) A is proper, i.e. dimk
(3) A is Gorenstein, i.e. the thick subcategory per A of the derived category D(A) generated by A
coincides with the thick subcategory generated by DA, where D = Homk(?, k) is the k-dual.

i∈Z Hi(A) < ∞;

L

In this case, we deﬁne Cohen-Macaulay dg A-modules as follows, where we denote by Db(A)
the full subcategory of D(A) consisting of the dg A-modules whose total cohomology is ﬁnite-
dimensional.

Deﬁnition 0.2 (Deﬁnition 2.1). (1) A dg A-module M in Db(A) is called a Cohen-Macaulay dg

A-module if Hi(M ) = 0 and HomDA(M, A[i]) = 0 for i > 0;

(2) We denote by CM A the subcategory of Db(A) consisting of Cohen-Macaulay dg A-modules.

Deﬁnition 0.2 is motived by the fact that if A is concentrated in degree zero, then the condition
(1) above gives an alternative description of classical Cohen-Macaulay modules [IY1, Theorem
3.10]. Moreover, in this case the category CM A forms a Frobenius category in the sense of [H1] and
the stable category CMA is a triangulated category which is triangle equivalent to the singularity
category Dsg(A) = Db(modA)/Kb(proj A) introduced by Buchweitz [Bu] and Orlov [O]. However,
CM A does not necessarily have a natural structure of exact category in our setting. Instead, the
following result shows it has a natural structure of extriangulated category introduced by Nakaoka
and Palu [NP].

Theorem 0.3 (Theorems 2.4, 3.1 and 3.7). Let A be a non-positive proper Gorenstein dg algebra.
Then
(1) CM A is functorially ﬁnite in Db(A);
(2) CM A is a Frobenius extriangulated category with Proj(CM A) = add A;
(3) The stable category CMA := (CM A)/[add A] is a triangulated category;
(4) The composition CM A ֒→ Db(A) → Db(A)/ per A induces a triangle equivalence

CMA = (CM A)/[add A] ≃ Db(A)/ per A = Dsg(A);
(5) CMA admits a Serre functor and CM A admits almost split extensions.

The main examples considered in this paper are trivial extension dg algebras and truncated poly-
nomial dg algebras. We determine all indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay dg modules over truncated
polynomial dg algebras concretely and give their AR quivers (see Theorem 4.2 for the details). We
also show that, in this case, the stable categories are cluster categories by using a criterion given
by Keller and Reiten [KR] (see Theorem 4.9).

One of the traditional subjects is the classiﬁcation of Gorenstein rings which are representation-
ﬁnite in the sense that they have only ﬁnitely many indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay modules.
Riedtmann [Rie2, Rie3] and Wiedemann [W] considered the classiﬁcation of representation-ﬁnite
self-injective algebras and Gorenstein orders respectively. In both classiﬁcations, conﬁgurations
play an important role. We may regard Wiedemann’s conﬁgurations as “0-Calabi-Yau” since they
are preserved by Serre functor S and regard Riedtmann’s conﬁgurations as “(−1)-Calabi-Yau” since
they are preserved by S ◦ [1]. Inspired by this, we introduce the negative Calabi-Yau conﬁgurations
to study the AR quivers of CM A.

Deﬁnition 0.4 (Deﬁnitions 5.1 and 5.2). Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt triangu-
lated category and let C be a set of indecomposable objects of T . We call C a (−d)-Calabi-Yau
conﬁguration (or (−d)-CY conﬁguration for short) for d ≥ 1 if the following conditions hold.

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

(1) dimk HomT (X, Y ) = δX,Y for X, Y ∈ C;
(2) HomT (X, Y [−j]) = 0 for any two objects X, Y in C and 0 < j ≤ d − 1;
(3) For any indecomposable object M in T , there exists X ∈ C and 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, such that

HomT (X, M [−j]) 6= 0.

We call C a d-simple-minded system (or d-SMS ), if it satisﬁes (1), (2) and
(3’) T = add Filt{C, C[1], · · · , C[d − 1]}.

It is precisely Riedtmann’s conﬁguration if d = 1 and T is the mesh category of Z∆ for a
Dynkin diagram ∆ (see [Rie2, Deﬁnition 2.3] for the details).
It is easy to see d-SMS implies
(−d)-CY conﬁguration and the converse is also true if Filt(C) is functorially ﬁnite in T due to
[CSP, Proposition 2.13]. “(−d)-Calabi-Yau conﬁguration” are also introduced as “left d-Riedtmann
conﬁguration” in [CS2], and further studied in [CS3, CSP]. When the AR quiver of T is Z∆/G
for some Dynkin diagram ∆ and some group G, Calabi-Yau conﬁguration can be characterized
combinatorially (see Section 5.3). Our name “(−d)-Calabi-Yau conﬁguration” is motivated by the
following theorem, which is new even for d = 1 (see Remark 5.4).

Theorem 0.5 (Theorem 5.3). Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category
with a Serre functor S. Let C be a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in T , then S[d]C = C.

We say a dg k-algebra A in Assumption 0.1 is d-self-injective (resp. d-symmetric) if add A =
add DA[d − 1] in D(A) (resp. D(Ae)). The following result, characterizing simple dg A-modules as
a (−d)-CY conﬁguration, generalizes [Rie2, Proposition 2.4].

Theorem 0.6 (Theorem 5.6). Let A be a d-self-injective dg algebra. Then the set of simple dg
A-modules is a d-SMS, and hence a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in CMA.

Let ∆ be a Dynkin digram. For a subset C of vertices of Z∆, we deﬁne a translation quiver
(Z∆)C by adding to Z∆ a vertex pc and two arrows c → pc → τ −1(c) for each c ∈ C (see
Deﬁnition 1.14). Our main result in this paper states that the converse of Theorem 0.6 also holds
in the following sense.
Theorem 0.7 (Theorem 7.1). Let ∆ be a Dynkin digram. Let C be a subset of vertices of Z∆/S[d].
The following are equivalent.
(1) C is a (−d)-CY conﬁguration;
(2) There exists a d-symmetric dg k-algebra A with AR quiver of CM A being (Z∆)C /S[d].

To study the classiﬁcation of conﬁgurations, Riedtmann [Rie2] gave a geometrical description of
conﬁgurations by Brauer relations, and Luo [L] gave a description of Wiedemann’s conﬁguration
by 2-Brauer relations. Similarly, we introduce maximal d-Brauer relations (see Deﬁnition 8.2). It
gives a nice description of (−d)-CY conﬁgurations of type An. This geometric model has been
studied by Coelho Sim˜oes [CS2, Theorem 6.5]. By using this model, we show the number of
(−d)-CY conﬁgurations in ZAn/S[d] is
(Corollary 8.20). We develop several
technical concepts and results on maximal d-Brauer relations and by using them we give another
proof of Theorem 0.7 for the case ∆ = An (Theorem 8.32). In this case, for any given (−d)-CY
conﬁguration C, the corresponding d-symmetric dg k-algebra is given explicitly by Brauer tree
dg algebra (see Section 8.3 for the details). The following table explains the comparison among
diﬀerent conﬁgurations.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 provides the necessary material on dg algebras,
extriangulated categories and translation quivers. In Section 2, we introduce Cohen-Macaulay dg
modules and show some basic properties of them. Section 3 deals with the Auslander-Reiten theory
in CM A. We compute the AR quiver of a truncated polynomial dg algebra in Section 4. From

its own point of view, this example is also interesting. We introduce (negative) CY-conﬁgurations
and combinatorial conﬁgurations in Section 5 and then show they coincide with each other in our
context. In Section 6, we construct a class of self-injective dg algebras by taking trivial extension.
In Section 7, we prove our main theorem that any CY conﬁguration is given by simples of symmetric
dg algebras. In section 8, we introduce the maximal d-Brauer relations and give a formula of the
number of (−d)-CY conﬁgurations in ZAn/S[d]. We prove Theorem 0.7 for the case ∆ = An by
constructing a Brauer tree dg algebra from given maximal d-Brauer relation. In Appendix A, we
give a new proof of the bijection between (−d)-CY conﬁgurations and maximal d-Brauer relations.

1. Preliminaries

1.1. Notations. Throughout this paper, k will be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. All algebras,
modules and categories are over the base ﬁeld k. We denote by D = Homk(?, k) the k-dual. When
we consider graded k-module, D means the graded dual. We denote by [1] the suspension functors
for the triangulated categories. Let T be a Krull-Schmidt k-linear category. We denote by ind T
the set of indecomposable objects in T . Let S and S′ be two full subcategories of T . Denote by
add S the smallest full subcategory of T containing S and closed under isomorphisms, ﬁnite direct
sums and direct summands. If T is a triangulated category, we denote by thick(S) the smallest
triangulated subcategory of T containing S and stable under direct summands. We denote by
S ∗ S′ the full subcategory of T consisting of objects T ∈ T such that there exists a triangle
X → T → Y → X[1] for X ∈ S and Y ∈ S′. If HomT (S, S′) = 0, that is, HomT (S, S′) = 0 for any
S ∈ S and S′ ∈ S′, we denote S ∗S′ by S ⊥ S′. We deﬁne FiltS as the category
n≥0 S ∗ S ∗ · · · ∗ S
.

If S = {S} has only one object, we write thick({S}) as thick(S), and we use same convention for

Filt and ∗.

1.2. DG algebras and the Nakayama functor. Let A be a dg k-algebra, that is, a graded
algebra endows with a compatible structure of a complex. A (right) dg A-module is a graded
A-module endows with a compatible structure of a complex. Let D(A) be the derived category of
right dg A-modules (see [Ke1, Ke3]). It is a triangulated category obtained from the category of
dg A-modules by formally inverting all quasi-isomorphisms. The shift functor is given by the shift
of complexes.

Let per A = thick(AA) ⊂ D(A) be the perfect category and let Db(A) be the full subcategory of

D(A) consisting of the objects whose total cohomology is ﬁnite-dimensional.

We consider the derived dg functor

ν :=? ⊗

L
A DA : D(A) → D(A),

called the Nakayama functor. We have the following Auslander-Reiten formula.

Lemma 1.1. [Ke1, Section 10.4] There is a bifunctorial isomorphism

D HomDA(X, Y ) ∼= HomDA(Y, ν(X))

for X ∈ per A and Y ∈ D(A).

It is clear that ν restricts to a triangle functor

ν : per A −→ thick(DA).

(1.1)

(1.2)

By Lemma 1.1, (1.2) is a triangle equivalence provides that A has ﬁnite-dimensional cohomology
in each degree. In this case, if we have per A = thick(DA) (for example, A is a ﬁnite-dimensional
Gorenstein k-algebra), then ν deﬁnes a Serre functor on per A. Immediately, we have the following
result.

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

Lemma 1.2. Assume A has ﬁnite-dimensional cohomology in each degree and per A = thick(DA)
in D(A). Let X, Y be two dg A-modules with ﬁnite-dimensional cohomology in each degree. Then
the isomorphism (1.1) also holds for Y ∈ per A and X ∈ D(A).

Let A be a dg k-algebra and let M be a dg A-module. Then H0(A) is an ordinary k-algebra

and we regard Hn(M ) as a H0(A)-module for n ∈ Z.

Lemma 1.3. Let A be a dg k-algebra and M ∈ D(A). Then
(1) [KN, Lemma 4.4] For P ∈ add A, the morphism of k-modules induced by H0

HomD(A)(P, M ) → HomH0(A)(H0(P ), H0(M ))

is an isomorphism;

(2) Dually, for I ∈ add DA, the morphism of k-modules induced by H0
HomD(A)(M, I) → HomH0(A)(H0(M ), H0(I))

is an isomorphism.

We need the following lemma for later use.

Lemma 1.4. Let A be a dg k-algebra and M ∈ D(A). Then
(1) Let P ∈ add A and f ∈ HomD(A)(M, P ). If the induced map H0(f ) : H0(M ) → H0(P ) is

surjective, then f is a retraction in D(A);

(2) Let I ∈ add DA and g ∈ HomD(A)(I, M ). If the induced map H0(g) : H0(I) → H0(M ) is

injective, then g is a section in D(A).

Proof. We only prove (1), since (2) is dual. Because H0(P ) is a projective H0(A)-module and
H0(f ) is surjective, then H0(f ) is a retraction. Then by Lemma 1.3, there is p ∈ HomD(A)(P, M ),
such that H0(f ) ◦ H0(p) = IdH0(P). By Lemma 1.3 again, we have f ◦ g = IdP. Therefore f is a
(cid:3)
retraction in D(A).

1.3. Non-positive dg algebras. We call a dg k-algebra A non-positive if it satisﬁes Hi(A) = 0
for i > 0. Write A as a complex over k,

A := · · · −→ A−1 d−1

−−→ A0 d0

−→ A1 −→ · · ·

Consider the following standard truncation.

A′ := · · · −→ A−1 d−1

−−→ ker d0 −→ 0 −→ · · ·

It is easy to see A′ is a sub-dg-algebra of A and the inclusion A′ ֒→ A is a quasi-isomorphism of dg
k-algebras. Thus in this paper, when we mention non-positive dg k-algebra A, we always assume
that Ai = 0 for i > 0. In this case, the canonical projection A → H0(A) is a homomorphism of dg
k-algebras (here we regard H0(A) as a dg algebra concentrated in degree 0). Then we can regard a
module over H0(A) as a dg module over A via this homomorphism. This induces a natural functor
mod H0(A) → D(A). Let {S1, . . . , Sr} be the set of isomorphic classes of simple H0(A)-modules.
We may regard them as simple dg A-modules. For any Si, there exists Pi ∈ add A such that
Si = top H0(Pi) := H0(Pi)/ rad H0(Pi). By Lemma 1.3, Pi is indecomposable in Db(A). Now
we introduce the radical of A, which will be used later. Let P ∈ add A. We have a short exact
sequence in mod H0(A)

0 → rad H0(P ) → H0(P )

f
−→ top H0(P ) → 0.

By Lemma 1.3, there is a morphism f ′ ∈ HomDb(A)(P, top H0(P )) which is sent to f by H0. Then
we deﬁne the radical of P in Db(A) as the third term of the following triangle.

It is well-known that simple dg A-modules generate Db(A) in the following sense.

rad P → P

f ′
−→ top H0(P ) → rad P [1].

Proposition 1.5. Let A be a non-positive dg k-algebra with Hi(A) ﬁnite-dimensional for i ∈ Z.
Then Db(A) = thick(

r
i=1 Si) and Db(A) is Hom-ﬁnite.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement can be shown by truncations and induction easily. The second one is
(cid:3)
from [Ke1, Theorem 3.1 (c)].

For i ∈ Z, Let Db

≥i) denote the full subcategory of Db(A) consisting of those
dg A-modules whose cohomologies are concentrated in degree ≤ i (respectively, ≥ i). This gives
us a standard t-structure [BBD] as the following result shows.

(3) Moreover, taking H0 is an equivalence from the H to mod H0(A), and the natural functor

mod H0(A) → Db(A) is a quasi-inverse to this equivalence.

We call a dg algebra A proper, if A ∈ Db(A). We end this section by a proposition, which plays

an important role in the proof of Theorem 8.32.

Proposition 1.7. Let A be a non-positive proper dg k-algebra whose underlying graded algebra is
a quotient kQ/I of the path algebra of a graded quiver Q. Let j and j′ be vertices in Q.
(1) If HomDb(A)(Sj, Sj′ [l]) 6= 0 for some l > 0, then there exists a path from j to j′ with degree

bigger than −l;

(2) Assume that the diﬀerential of A is zero and I is an admissible ideal of kQ. If there is an

arrow j → j′ with degree −l ≤ 0, then HomDb(A)(Sj , Sj′ [l + 1]) 6= 0.

Proof. (1) Let X0 := Sj. For each i ≥ 0, we take the following triangle,

Xi+1 → Qi → Xi → Xi+1[1],
such that Qi ∈ add A[≥ 0] and the induced map H∗(Qi) → H∗(Xi) is the projective cover of H∗(Xi)
as a graded H∗(A)-module. Then we have an exact sequence

0 → H∗(Xi+1) → H∗(Qi) → H∗(Xi) → 0.
Thus the composition Qi+1 → Xi+1 → Qi is non-zero. For each direct summand Pai[si] of Qi with
a vertex ai of Q and si ∈ Z, there exists a direct summand Pai−1 [si−1] of Qi−1 with a vertex ai−1
in Q and si−1 ∈ Z, such that HomDb(A)(Pai [si], Pai−1 [si−1]) 6= 0. Then there is a path ai−1   ai
with degree si−1 − si. Repeating this, we obtain a path j = a0   a1   · · ·   ai with degree

i
k=1(sk−1 − sk) = s0 − si = −si.
By the construction above, we have Sj ∈ Q0 ∗ Q1[1] ∗ Q2[2] ∗ · · · ∗ Ql[l] ∗ Db

≤−l−1. Since
P
HomDb(A)(Y, Sj′ [l]) = 0 for any Y ∈ Db
≤−l−1 and by our assumption HomDb(A)(Sj, Sj′ [l]) 6= 0,
then there exists a non-zero map from some object in add(Q0 ∗ Q1[1] ∗ Q2[2] ∗ · · · ∗ Ql[l]) to Sj′ [l],
which implies Pj′ [l] ∈ add Qk[k] for some 0 ≤ k ≤ l. Since Q0 = Pj and l is positive, we have
1 ≤ k ≤ l. Since Pj′ [l − k] ∈ add Qk, by our argument above, there is a path from j to j′ with
degree k − l, which is bigger than −l.
(2) Consider the following triangle,

rad Pj → Pj → Sj → rad Pj[1].
Since the diﬀerential of A is zero, I is admissible, and there is an arrow j → j′ with degree −l,
then Sj′ ∈ add H−l( rad Pj
)[l] → Sj′ [l] is
rad2 Pj
non-zero. Thus HomDb(A)(rad Pj, Sj′ [l]) 6= 0. Applying the functor HomDb(A)(?, Sj′ [l + 1]) to the
triangle above, we obtain an exact sequence

). Then the composition rad Pj → rad Pj
rad2 Pj

→ H−l( rad Pj
rad2 Pj

HomDb(A)(Sj, Sj′ [l]) → HomDb(A)(Pj , Sj′ [l]) → HomDb(A)(rad Pj, Sj′ [l]) → HomDb(A)(Sj, Sj′ [l+1]).

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

By dividing into two cases, (l, j) = (0, j′) or not, one can check that the left map is always
(cid:3)
surjective. Then HomDb(A)(Sj, Sj′ [l + 1]) 6= 0.

1.4. Extriangulated categories. In this section, we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition and basic prop-
erties of extriangulated categories from [NP]. We omit some details here, but the reader can ﬁnd
them in [NP].

Let C be an additive category equipped with an additive bifunctor E : C op ⊗ C → Ab. For
any pair of objects A, C ∈ C , an element δ ∈ E(C, A) is called an E-extension. Let s be a
y
−→ C] to any E-extension
correspondence which associates an equivalence class s(δ) = [A
δ ∈ E(C, A). This s is called a realization of E if it makes the diagrams in [NP, Deﬁnition 2.9]
commutative. A triple (C , E, s) is called an extriangulated category if it satisﬁes the following
conditions.
(1) E : C op ⊗ C → Ab is an additive bifunctor;
(2) s is an additive realization of E;
(3) E and s satisfy the compatibility conditions in [NP, Deﬁnition 2.12].

x

Extriangulated categories is a generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. Let

us see some easy examples.

Example 1.8. (1) Let C be an exact category. Then C is extriangulated by taking E as the
C (C, A), taking s(δ) as the equivalence

C (?, ?) : C op⊗C → Ab and for any δ ∈ Ext1

bifunctor Ext1
class of short exact sequences (=conﬂations) correspond to δ;

(2) Let C be a triangulated category. Then C is extriangulated by taking E as the bifunctor
HomC (?, ?[1]) : C op ⊗ C → Ab, and for any δ ∈ HomC (C, A[1]), taking s(δ) as the equivalence
class of the triangle A → B → C

δ
−→ A[1];

(3) Let C be a triangulated category and let D be an extension-closed (that is, for any triangle
X → Y → Z → X[1] in C , if X, Z ∈ D, then Y ∈ D) subcategory of C . Then D has an
extriangulated structure given by restricting the extriangulated structure of C on D.

Let (C , E, s) be an extriangulated category. An object X in C is called projective if E(X, Y ) = 0
for any Y ∈ C . We say C has enough projective objects if for any Y ∈ C , there exists Z ∈ C
and δ ∈ E(Y, Z), such that the middle term of the realization s(δ) is projective. We denote by P
(resp. I ) the subcategory of projective (resp. injectvie) objects. When C has enough projective
injective) objects, we deﬁne the stable (resp. costable) category of C as the ideal quotient
(resp.
C := C /[P] (resp. C := C /[I ]). We call C Frobenius if it has enough projective objects
and enough injective objects, and projective objects coincide with injective ones. In this case C
coincides with C , and we call C the stable category of C .

Proposition 1.9. [NP, Corollary 7.4] Let (C , E, s) be a Frobenius extriangulated category and let
I be subcategory of injective objects. Then C is a triangulated category.

split if it satisﬁes the following conditions
(1) E(C, a)(δ) = 0 for any non-section a ∈ C (A, A′);
(2) E(c, A)(δ) = 0 for any non-retraction c ∈ C (C′, C).

We say that C has right almost split extensions if for any endo-local non-projective object
A ∈ C , there exists an almost split extension δ ∈ E(A, B) for some B ∈ C . Dually, we say that C
has left almost split extensions if for any endo-local non-projective object B ∈ C , there exists an
almost split extension δ ∈ E(A, B) for some A ∈ C . We say that C has almost split extensions if
it has right and left almost split extensions.

Let A ∈ C .

If there exists an almost split extension δ ∈ E(A, B), then it is unique up to

isomorphism of E-extensions.

Deﬁnition 1.11. [INP, Deﬁnition 3.2] Let (C , E, s) be a k-linear extriangulated category.

(1) A right Auslander-Reiten-Serre (ARS) duality is a pair (τ, η) of an additive functor τ : C → C

and a binatural isomorphism

ηA,B : C (A, B) ≃ DE(B, τ A) for any A, B ∈ C ;

(2) If moreover τ is an equivalence, we say that (τ, η) is an Auslander-Reiten-Serre (ARS) duality.

We say a k-linear extriangulated category (C , E, s) is Ext-ﬁnite, if dimkE(A, B) < ∞ for any

A, B ∈ C .

Proposition 1.12. [INP, Theorem 3.4] Let C be a k-linear Ext-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt extriangulated
category. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) C has almost split extensions;
(2) C has an Auslander-Reiten-Serre duality.

The following characterization of almost split extensions are analogous to the corresponding
result on Auslander-Reiten triangles (see [RV, Proposition I.2.1]) and on almost split sequences
(see [ARS]).

Proposition 1.13. Assume (C , E, s) has almost split extensions. Assume A ∈ C is an end-local
object and δ ∈ E(A, B). Then the following are equivalent.

(1) δ is an almost split extension;
(2) δ is in the socle of E(A, B) as right EndC (A)-module and B ∼= τ (A);
(3) δ is in the socle of E(A, B) as left EndC (B)-module and B ∼= τ (A).

1.6. Translation quivers. We recall some deﬁnitions and notations concerning quivers. A quiver
Q = (Q0, Q1, s, t) is given by the set Q0 of its vertices, the set Q1 of its arrows, a source map s
and a target map t. If x ∈ Q0 is a vertex, we denote by x+ the set of direct successors of x, and
by x− the set of its direct predecessors. We say that Q is locally ﬁnite if for each vertex x ∈ Q0,
there are ﬁnitely many arrows ending at x and starting at x. An automorphism group G of Q is
said to be weakly admissible if for each g ∈ G\{1} and for each x ∈ Q0 , we have x+ ∩ (gx)+ = ∅.
A stable translation quiver (Q, τ ) is a locally ﬁnite quiver Q without double arrows with a
bijection τ : Q0 → Q0 such that (τ x)+ = x− for each vertex x. For each arrow α : x → y, we
denote by σα the unique arrow τ y → x.

Deﬁnition 1.14. Let Q be a stable translation quiver and C be a subset of Q0. We deﬁne a
translation quiver QC by adding to Q0 a vertex pc and two arrows c → pc → τ −1(c) for each
c ∈ C. The translation of QC coincides with the translation of Q on Q0 and is not deﬁned on
{pc | c ∈ C}.

Let ∆ be an oriented tree, then the repetition quiver of ∆ is deﬁned as follows:

(1) (Z∆)0 = Z × ∆0
(2) (Z∆)1 = Z×∆1 ∪σ(Z×∆1) with arrows (n, α) : (n, x) → (n, y) and σ(n, α) : (n−1, y) → (n, x)

for each arrow α : x → y of ∆.

The quiver Z∆ with the translation τ (n, x) = (n − 1, x) is a stable translation quiver which does
not depend (up to isomorphism) on the orientation of ∆ (see [Rie1]).

From now on, we assume ∆ is a Dynkin diagram. Let us ﬁx a numbering and an orientation of

the simply-laced Dynkin trees.

We deﬁne the “Nakayama permutation” S of Z∆ as follows:
• if ∆ = An, then S(p, q) = (p + q − 1, n + 1 − q);
• if ∆ = Dn with n even, then S = τ −n+2;
• if ∆ = Dn with n odd, then S = τ −n+2φ, where φ is the automorphism which exchanges n and

n − 1;

• if ∆ = E6, then S = φτ −5, where φ is the automorphism which exchanges 2 and 5, and 1 and 6;
• if ∆ = E7, then S = τ −8;
• if ∆ = E8, then S = τ −14.
By [G, Proposition 6.5], when we identify the Auslander-Reiten quiver of k∆ as the full subquiver
of Z∆, the Nakayama functor is related to S deﬁned above. We can also deﬁne “shift permutation”
[1] of Z∆ by Sτ −1.

2. Cohen-Macaulay dg modules

Let A be a dg k-algebra. In this section, we assume A satisﬁes Assumption 0.1.

Deﬁnition 2.1. (1) A dg A-module M is called Cohen-Macaulay if M ∈ Db

≤0(A) and HomDb(A)(M, A[i]) =

0 for i > 0;

(2) We denote by CM A the subcategory of Db(A) consisting of Cohen-Macaulay dg A-modules.

If A is an ordinary k-algebra, then CM A deﬁned here is canonically equivalent to the usual
one. We mention that Yekutieli also introduced Cohen-Macaulay dg modules (see [Ye1, Section
8]), but they are diﬀerent from ours. Now we introduce some special dg algebras which are the
main objects in this paper.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let A be a non-positive dg k-algebra and let d be a positive integer.
(1) We call A d-self-injective if add A = add(DA[d − 1]) in D(A);
(2) We call A d-symmetric if add A = add(DA[d − 1]) in D(Ae).

Since in our setting A is Gorenstein, then the equivalence (1.2) induces the following triangle

auto-equivalence.

ν : per A ≃ per A,
and moreover we get another triangle auto-equivalence ν : Db(A) ≃ Db(A). In particular, ν is a
Serre functor on per A. We give another description of CM A as follows.

Proposition 2.3. (1) CM A = Db
(2) In particular, If A is a d-self-injective dg algebra, then CM A = Db

≤0 ∩ ν−1(Db

≥0);

≤0 ∩ Db

≥−d+1.

Proof. (1) By deﬁnition,

A[< 0]⊥ = {X ∈ Db(A) | HomDb(A)(A[< 0], X) = 0} = Db

≤0.

By Lemma 1.2, H<0(ν(X)) = HomDb(A)(A[> 0], ν(X)) = D HomDb(A)(X, A[> 0]), then

⊥A[> 0] = {X ∈ Db(A) | H<0(ν(X)) = 0} = {X ∈ Db(A) | ν(X) ∈ Db

≥0}.

Then CM A = Db

≥0).
(2) Let X ∈ CM A. If A is d-self-injective, then we have

≤0 ∩ ν−1(Db

HomDA(X, A[> 0]) = HomDb(A)(X, DA[> d − 1]) = D HomDb(A)(A[> d − 1], X) = 0,

which implies X ∈ Db

≥−d+1. So CM A = Db

≤0 ∩ Db

≥−d+1.

(cid:3)

The ﬁrst properties of CM A are the following, which are analogues of the well-known properties
of Cohen-Macaulay modules. We refer to Section 1.4 for the notion of extriangulated category. We
call the Verdier quotient Db(A)/ per A the singularity category Dsg(A) of A.

Theorem 2.4. Let A be a dg k-algebra satisfying Assumption 0.1. Then
(1) CM A is an Ext-ﬁnite Frobenius extriangulated category with Proj(CM A) = add A;
(2) The stable category CMA := (CM A)/[add A] is a triangulated category;
(3) The composition CM A ֒→ Db(A) → Db(A)/ per A induces a triangle equivalence

CMA = (CM A)/[add A] ≃ Db(A)/ per A = Dsg(A).

Proof. By our deﬁnition, CM A is an extension-closed subcategory of Db(A), then it has a natural
extriangulated category structure by restricting the triangles of Db(A) on CM A (see [NP, Remark
2.18]). By Proposition 1.5, Db(A) is Hom-ﬁnite, then so is CM A. It implies that CM A is Ext-ﬁnite
and add A is functorially ﬁnite in CM A.

Since HomCM A(P, X[1]) = 0 = HomCM A(X, P [1]) for any P ∈ add A and X ∈ CM A, then
we have add A ⊂ Proj(CM A) ∩ Inj(CM A). For any X ∈ CM A, we consider the right (add A)-
approximation P → X, which extends to the following triangle in Db(A).

Y → P → X → Y [1].

It is easy to check Y ∈ CM A by applying the functors HomDb(A)(A[< 0], ?) and HomDb(A)(?, A[>
0]) to the triangle above. So CM A has enough projectives. Similarly, it also has enough injectives.
Finally, we show Proj(CM A) = add A = Inj(CM A). Assume X ∈ CM A is projective, and take
a right (add A)-approximation P → X. As we have shown above, we have a triangle Y → P →
X → Y [1] where Y ∈ CM A. Since X is projective, then HomCM A(X, Y [1]) = 0. Then the triangle
splits and thus X ∈ add A. So Proj(CM A) = add A. Similarly, one can show Inj(CM A) = add A.
Then by Proposition 1.9, CMA is a triangulated category.

For the last statement, applying [IY2, Corollary 2.1] to T = Db(A) and P = add A, we have
(cid:3)

CMA is triangle equivalent to Db(A)/ per A.

Immediately, we have the following.

Corollary 2.5. In Theorem 2.4, Db(A) = per A if and only if CM A = add A.

Recall from [NP], the suspension functor in CMA is given by the cone of a left (add A)-
approximation X → P → Ω−1X → X[1] for X ∈ CM A. The following result is an analogue
of the well-known properties for classical Gorenstein rings.

Proposition 2.6. Let A be a dg algebra satisfying Assumption 0.1. Then
(1) There is a duality ( )∗ = RH omA(?, A) : Db(A)

≃
−→ Db(Aop), which restricts to a duality

CM A

≃
−→ CM(Aop);

(2) For X, Y ∈ CM A and i > 0, we have HomDb(A)(X, Y [i]) = HomCMA(X, Ω−iY ).

≃
Proof. (1) The functor ( )∗ : D(A) → D(Aop) restricts to a duality per A
−→ per(Aop). For any
M ∈ Db(A), it is clear that RH omA(M, DA) = DM ∈ Db(Aop). Since A is Gorenstein, then
≃
A ∈ thick(DA) and moreover, ( )∗ also induces a duality Db(A)
−→ Db(Aop). Since CM A = A[<

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

11

0]⊥ ∩ ⊥A[> 0], it is clear that ( )∗ restricts to a functor ( )∗ : CM A → CM(Aop) and it is a duality.
We have the following diagram.

Db(A)

≃

/ Db(Aop)

CM A

≃

/ CM(Aop).

(2) Consider the following triangle induced by the left (add A)-approximation of Y ,

Y → Q → Ω−1Y → Y [1].

Applying HomDb(A)(X, ?) to the triangle above, since HomDb(A)(X, A[> 0]) = 0, we see

HomDb(A)(X, Ω−1Y [t]) = HomDb(A)(X, Y [t + 1])

for t ≥ 1. Moreover, we have the following exact sequence.

HomDb(A)(X, Q) → HomDb(A)(X, Ω−1Y ) → HomDb(A)(X, Y [1]) → 0.
Since HomDb(A)(A, Y [1]) = 0, then for P ∈ add A, every map P → Ω−1Y has a decomposition
P → Q → Ω−1Y . Then

HomCMA(X, Ω−1Y ) = HomDb(A)(X, Ω−1Y )/ HomDb(A)(X, Q),

which is isomorphic to HomDb(A)(X, Y [1]). Then by induction, one can show HomDb(A)(X, Y [i]) =
(cid:3)
HomCMA(X, Ω−iY ) holds for any i ≥ 1.

The following proposition tells us that when CM A is an ordinary Frobenius category for a

d-self-injective dg algebra A.

Proposition 2.7. Assume A is a d-self-injective dg k-algebra. Then CM A is a Frobenius category
with add A as projective objects if and only if d = 1 (that is, A has total cohomology concentrated
in degree 0).

Proof. If A has total cohomology concentrated in degree 0, then A is quasi-isomorphic to H0(A). In
this case, H0(A) is a Gorenstein k-algebra and CM A is equivalent to CM H0(A), which is Frobenius.
On the other hand, suppose X is a non-zero object of CM A. If CM A is a Frobenius category

with add A as projective objects, then

HomCM A(A, X) = HomDb(A)(A, X) = H0(X) 6= 0

which implies X 6∈ Db
Then d = 1, which implies that A has total cohomology concentrated in degree 0.

≤−1 = 0. But by Proposition 2.3, CM A = Db

≤−1. So CM A ∩ Db

≤0 ∩ Db

≥−d+1.

3. Auslander-Reiten theory in CM A

We assume that all the dg k-algebras considered in this section satisfy Assumption 0.1.

3.1. Serre duality and almost split extensions. The aim of this section is to prove the fol-
lowing theorem.
Theorem 3.1. (1) CMA admits a Serre functor ν[−1] =? ⊗L
(2) CM A admits almost split extensions.

A DA[−1];

We ﬁrst show CMA admits a Serre functor. We will consider it in a general setting given in [Am,
Section 1.2]. Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite triangulated category and N be a thick subcategory
of T . Assume T has an auto-equivalence S, which gives a relative Serre duality in the sense that
S(N ) ⊂ N and there exists a functorial isomorphism for any X ∈ N and Y ∈ T

D HomT (X, Y ) ≃ HomT (Y, SX).

Deﬁnition 3.2. [Am, Deﬁnition 1.2] Let X and Y be objects in T . A morphism p : P → X is
called a local N -cover of X relative to Y if P is in N and it induces an exact sequence

0 → HomT (X, Y )

p∗
−→ HomT (P, Y ).

Dually, let Y and Z be objects in T . A morphism q : Y → Q is called a local N -envelop of Y
relative to Z if Q is in N and it induces an exact sequence

0 → HomT (Z, Y )

q∗−→ HomT (Z, Q).

Amiot gave the following suﬃcient condition for T /N to admit a Serre functor.

Proposition 3.3. [Am, Theorem 1.3] Assume for any X, Y ∈ T , there is a local N -cover of X
relative to Y and a local N -envelop of SX relative to Y . Then the quotient category T /N admits
a Serre functor given by S[−1].

To check the condition in Proposition 3.3, the following lemma is useful.

Lemma 3.4. [Am, Proposition 1.4] Let X and Y be two objects in T . If for any P ∈ N the vector
space HomT (P, X) and HomT (Y, P ) are ﬁnite-dimensional, then the existence of a local N -cover
of X relative to Y is equivalent to the existence of a local N -envelop of Y relative to X.

In our setting, to apply Proposition 3.3, we need the following observation.

Lemma 3.5. For any X, Y ∈ Db(A), there exists an object PX ∈ per A with a morphism PX
such that we have the following exact sequence.

p
−→ X

0 → HomDb(A)(X, Y )

p∗
−→ HomDb(A)(PX , Y ).

Proof. Since A is non-positive and X, Y ∈ Db(A), by truncation, we may assume

X := [· · · 0 → X m dm−−→ X m+1 dm+1−−−→ · · ·
Y := [· · · 0 → Y s ds−→ Y s+1 ds+1−−−→ · · ·

dn−1−−−→ X n → 0 → · · · ],
dt−1−−−→ Y t → 0 → · · · ].

Apply induction on n − s.

If n − s < 0, then HomDb(A)(X, Y ) = 0, we can take any object in per A as PX .
Now assume the result is true for n − s = k. Consider the case n − s = k + 1.
There exists QX ∈ add A[−n] and a morphism p : QX → X such that Hn(p) is surjective.
Then Hi≥n(cone(p)) = 0. Let Z = cone(p). By our assumption, there exists PZ ∈ per A with a
morphism r : PZ → Z satisﬁes our condition. By the Octahedral Axiom, we have the following
diagram.

QX

/ PX

PZ

/ QX[1]

Then it is easy to check PX is the cover we want.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3.1.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. (1) Since per A = thick(DA), then ν induces triangle equivalences Db(A) ≃
Db(A) and per A ≃ per A. Moreover, ν gives a relative Serre duality by Lemma 1.1. We only need
to show the conditions in Proposition 3.3 hold in our setting. Because Db(A) is Hom-ﬁnite by
Proposition 1.5, then by Lemma 3.4, it suﬃces to check the existence of local per A-cover. This
has been proved in Lemma 3.5. So the assertion is true.

(2) By Proposition 1.5, Db(A) is Hom-ﬁnite, then CM A is Ext-ﬁnite (see Section 1.5). It is clear
that CM A is a k-linear Krull-Schmidt extriangulated category. Moreover, CMA admits a Serre
(cid:3)
functor by (1), then by Proposition 1.12, CM A admits almost split extensions.

We give the following lemma for later use.

Lemma 3.6. Let X be an non-projective indecomposable object in CMA. Let τ be the Auslander-
Reiten translation. If EndCMA(X) = k, then any non-split extension

τ (X)

f
−→ Y

g
−→ X

is an almost split extension.

Proof. By Proposition 1.13, it is clear.

(cid:3)

3.2. Cohen-Macaulay approximation. In this subsection, we show the following result.

Theorem 3.7. (1) CM A is functorially ﬁnite in Db(A);
(2) More precisely, we have the following result, where ( )∗ = RH omAop(?, Aop) : Db(Aop)

≃
−→

Db(A).

Db(A) = CM A ⊥ add(FiltA[> 0]) ⊥ Db

>0(A) = Db

>0(Aop)∗ ⊥ add(FiltA[< 0]) ⊥ CM A.

Immediately, CM A admits a property analogous to the usual Cohen-Macaulay approximation (see
[ABu]) in the following sense.

Corollary 3.8. Let M ∈ Db

≤0(A), then there is a triangle

P → T → M → P [1],

such that T → M is a right (CM A)-approximation of M and P ∈ per A.

To show the theorem, we consider the t-structures and co-t-structures on Db(A) ﬁrst. Let

A≥l = A>l−1

:= add

A[−l − i] ∗ · · · ∗ A[−l − 1] ∗ A[−l],

A≤l = A<l+1

:= add

i≥0
[

i≥0
[

A[−l] ∗ A[−l + 1] ∗ · · · ∗ A[−l + i].

There are two t-structures and two co-t-structures [P] (also called weight structures [Bo]) in

Db(A) induced by A.

Lemma 3.9. (1) The two paris (A[< 0]⊥, A[> 0]⊥) and (⊥A[< 0], ⊥A[> 0]) are t-structures on

Db(A);

(2) The two pairs (⊥A[> 0], A≤0) and (A≥0, A[< 0]⊥) are co-t-structures on Db(A).

Proof. (1) By Proposition 1.6, (A[< 0]⊥, A[> 0]⊥) = (Db
≥0) is a t-structure on Db(A). Since
the Nakayama functor ν induces a triangle equivalence ν : Db(A) ≃ Db(A), then applying ν−1 to
this t-structure, we get a new t-structure (⊥A[< 0], ⊥A[> 0]) on Db(A).

≃

We end this section by giving a result analogous to famous results of Auslander and Yamagata
[ARS, Theorem VI.1.4][Ya] on the ﬁrst Brauer-Thrall theorem. For an object X ∈ Db(A), there is
an integer t such that H<t(X) = 0 and Ht(X) 6= 0. By the standard truncation, we may assume
X i = 0 for i < t and in this case, we have a natural inclusion Ht(X) ֒→ X. So we may regard
soc Ht(X) as the socle soc X of X.

Proposition 3.10. Let S be a ﬁnite subset of ind(CM A). Then S = ind(CM A) if S is closed under
successors in the AR quiver of CM A and for any i ≥ 0, there exists a left (CM A)-approximation
A[i] → X in Db(A) such that X ∈ add S.

Proof. Notice that A id−→ A is the minimal left (CM A)-approximation of A, then A ∈ add S by
our assumption. Let M ∈ ind(CM A). Then there exists i ≥ 0 such that HomCM A(A[i], M ) 6= 0.
Let N be the left (CM A)-approximation of A[i] such that N ∈ add S. Then HomCM A(N, M ) 6= 0.
Let X1 be an indecomposable direct summand of N with 0 6= f ∈ HomCM A(X1, M ). If f is a
section, since X1, M ∈ ind(CM A), then X1 ∼= M and we are done. If f is not a section, consider
the left almost split morphism g : X1 → Y (If X1 ∈ add A, g is given by X1 → X1/ soc X1). Then
there is an h ∈ HomCM A(Y, M ) such that f = h ◦ g. So we can ﬁnd an indecomposable module
X2 ∈ add Y , such that the composition X1 → X2 → M is non-zero. Repeat this step, we may
construct a series of indecomposable modules X1 → X2 → · · · → M , such that the composition is
non-zero. Since S is closed under successors, then Xi ∈ S. Since S is ﬁnite and CM A is Hom-ﬁnite,
then rad(S, S)N = 0 for big enough N . So there exist n ≥ 1 such that Xn = M and M ∈ add S.
(cid:3)
Therefore S = ind(CM A).

4. Example: truncated polynomial dg algebras

In this section, we give some examples. The reader may skip this section, since results here will

not be used in this paper. Consider a truncated polynomial dg k-algebra.

A := k[X]/(X n+1), n ≥ 0,

with deg X = −d ≤ 0 and zero diﬀerential. We determine the indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay
modules explicitly and draw the AR quiver of CM A. Then we show CMA is a (d + 1)-cluster
category by using a criterion given by Keller and Reiten [KR]. Let Ai be the dg A-module
k[X]/(X i), i = 1, 2, · · · , n. We give two small examples ﬁrst.

Before proving Theorem 4.2, we consider AR triangles in CMA ﬁrst.

It is easy to see that
A is an (nd + 1)-symmetric dg algebra. Then by Proposition 2.3, CM A = Db
≥−nd. The
Nakayama functor ν : Db(A) → Db(A) is given by ν =? ⊗L
A DA = [−nd]. By Theorem 3.1, CMA
admits a Serre functor ν[−1] = [−nd − 1]. Moreover, the Auslander-Reiten translation on CMA is
τ = [−nd − 2]. The following lemma shows Ai and Ti,t are indecomposable.
Lemma 4.3. Let Ai, Ti,t be deﬁned as above. Then
(1) EndCMA(Ai) = EndCM A(Ai) = k. Moreover, each Ai is indecomposable in CMA;
(2) Ti,t is indecomposable in CM A.
Proof. (1) For any Ai, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a natural triangle in Db(A).

≤0 ∩ Db

(4.2)
Since An+1−i[id] ∈ D≤−id and Ai ∈ D≥−(i−1)d, then HomDb(A)(An+1−i[≥ id], Ai) = 0. Applying
HomDb(A)(?, Ai) to triangle (4.2), we have

An+1−i[id] → A → Ai → An+1−i[id + 1].

EndDb(A)(Ai) ∼= HomDb(A)(A, Ai) = k.

16

HAIBO JIN

So Ai is indecomposable in CM A. Since A itself is indecomposable in CM A by EndCM A(A) = k,
and Ai 6= A by cohomology. Then Ai 6∈ add A, and Ai is a non-zero object in CM A.

(2) It is clear Ti,t ∼= Ai[td] in CMA. So Ti,t is indecomposable in CMA by (1). Because if t = 0,
Ti,0 = Ai and if t > 0, HomCM A(A, Ai[td]) = 0, then Ti,t does not contain P ∈ add A as a direct
(cid:3)
summand. Thus Ti,t is also indecomposable in CM A.

We point out the periodicity of CMA.

Lemma 4.4. The functor [(n + 1)d + 2] : CMA → CMA is isomorphic to the identity functor. In
particular, τ ∼= [d] as functors on CMA and CMA is (d + 1)-Calabi-Yau.

Proof. Consider the following sequence in the category of dg A ⊗ Aop-modules.

0 → A[(n + 1)d]

f
−→ A ⊗ A[d]

g
−→ A ⊗ A

h
−→ A → 0

n
i=0 X i ⊗ X n−i, g is given by g(1 ⊗ 1) := 1 ⊗ X − X ⊗ 1 and h is given
where f is given by f (1) :=
by h(1 ⊗ 1) := 1. Since it is an exact sequence of graded modules, we get two natural triangles in
D(A ⊗ Aop).

P

h
−→ A ⊗ A → A → Ker h[1]

Ker h
f
−→ A ⊗ A[d] −→ Ker h → A[(n + 1)d + 1]

A[(n + 1)d]

Let M ∈ Db(A). Apply the functor M ⊗L

A? to the triangles above, we get two triangles in Db(A):
L
A Ker h[1],

L
A Ker h → M ⊗ A → M → M ⊗

M ⊗

M [(n + 1)d] → M ⊗ A[d] → M ⊗

L
A Ker h → M [(n + 1)d + 1].

Notice that M ⊗ A ∈ per A, then we have natural isomorphisms M
Ker h

∼
−→ M [(n + 1)d + 1] in Db(A)/ per A ∼= CMA, which give us the desired isomorphism.

A Ker h[1] and M ⊗L

In fact one may consider the shifts of simple dg A-module A1 = k.

Remark 4.5. The integer (n + 1)d + 2 is the smallest natural number r such that [r] ≃ id
on CMA.
It is clear that
k[i] ∈ CM A for 0 ≤ i ≤ nd. By the triangle (4.2), we have k[nd + 1] ∼= An in CMA (notice that
An[0, 1, . . . , d] ∈ CM A). Then it is easy to check that k can not be isomorphic to k[i] in CMA for
0 ≤ i ≤ (n + 1)d + 1.

Now we describe the AR-triangles in CMA.

Proposition 4.6. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let πi be the natural surjective map πi : Ai → Ai−1 and let ιi be
the natural injective map ιi : Ai[d] → Ai+1 given by ιi(1) := X. Let A0 = 0. Then the AR triangle
in CMA ending in Ai is given by

Ai[d]

πi[d]
−ιi[d]

−−−−−−→ Ai−1[d] ⊕ Ai+1
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

( ιi−1 πi+1 )
−−−−−−−−→ Ai.

Proof. First notice that the given sequence is a short exact sequence of graded modules and it
gives a triangle in Db(A) (so in CMA). By Lemma 4.3, Aj[m] is indecomposable in CMA for any
m ∈ Z, so the given triangle can not be split. Since EndCMA(Ai) = k, then by Lemma 3.6, the
(cid:3)
triangle above is an AR triangle.

It is easy to see that the AR quiver of CMA is of the form ZAn/φ by Proposition 4.6 and the
fact that Ti,t are shifts of Ai in CMA. Now we determine the fundamental domain. Notice that by
Lemma 4.4, Ai = Ai[(n + 1)d + 2] and by the triangle (4.2), An+1−i = Ai[−id − 1] in CMA. We
need to ﬁnd the smallest positive integer m such that Ai = Ai[md] or An+1−i = Ai[md] holds.
Lemma 4.7. (1) Assume d is even. Let N := (n+1)d

. Then N is the smallest positive integer

2

such that Ai = Ai[(N + 1)d];

(2) Assume d is odd. Let Ni := (n+1)d+n−2i+1

2

An+1−i = Ai[(Ni + 1)d].

. Then Ni is the smallest positive integer such that

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

17

Proof. (1) It is obvious Ai = Ai[(N + 1)d] by Lemma 4.4. By Remark 4.5, we know (n + 1)d + 2
is the smallest natural number r such that [r] ≃ id on CMA. Let d = 2e.
If l > 0 satisﬁes
Ai = Ai[ld], then (n + 1)d + 2 | ld, that is (n + 1)e + 1 | le. Since (n + 1)e + 1 and e are coprime,
then (n + 1)e + 1 | l and l ≥ (n + 1)e + 1 = N + 1.

(2) Assume positive integer s satisﬁes An+1−i = Ai[sd]. Then by the fact that An+1−i =
2 ((n+1)d+2)+(s− (n+1)d+n+3−2i
),
(cid:3)

Ai[−id−1], we have (n+1)d+2 | sd+id+1. Since sd+id+1 = d+1
then we need (n + 1)d + 2 | s − (n+1)d+n+3−2i

. So the smallest s is Ni + 1.

We can prove Theorem 4.2 now.

Proof of Theorem 4.2. The AR triangle given in Proposition 4.6 is induced by some conﬂation

Ti,1 → Ti−1,1 ⊕ Ti+1,0 → Ti,0

(4.3)

up to taking projective direct sums in CM A (see [NP]). Notice that for the projective-injective
object A, the only right almost split morphism is given by the natural injection Tn,1 = An[d] → A
and the only left almost split morphism is given by the natural surjection A → An = Tn,0. Then
the extension (4.3) is an almost split extension in CM A for i 6= n. Then by Lemma 4.7, the AR
sub-quiver S of CM A consisting of Ti,d is given as in Theorem 4.2. We only need to show Ti,d
gives all indecomposable CM A-modules.

By Proposition 3.10, it suﬃces to show that every left (CM A)-approximation of A[p], p ≥ 0,
belongs to add S. First notice that if p > nd or p = 0, the assertion is obvious (because for the
case p > nd, we have a natural approximation A[p] → 0 and for the case p = 0, the approximation
is given by A id−→ A). We only consider other cases and we may assume td < p ≤ (t + 1)d for
some 0 ≤ t ≤ n − 1. Then the left (CM A)-approximation of A[p] is given by the natural map
A[p] → An−t[p]. To show An−t[p] ∈ add S, it is enough to show An−t[p] = Ti,s = Ai[sd] in CMA
for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n and s ≥ 0. It can be shown in the following way.

• Assume (t+1)d−p is even and q = ((t+1)d−p)/2. Then An−t[p] = An−t[((n+1)d+2)q +p] =

An−t[sd], where s = (n + 1)q + t + 1. So An−t[p] = Tn−t,s ∈ add S.

• Assume (t + 1)d − p is odd and q = ((t + 1)d − p − 1)/2. By triangle (4.2), we have An−t[p] =

At+1[(n − t)d + p + 1] in CMA. Then

An−t[p] = An−t[((n + 1)d + 2)q + p] = At+1[sd],

where s = (n + 1)(q + 1). So An−t[p] = Tt+1,s ∈ add S.

Then the result is true.

(cid:3)

Before giving the second result of this section, we give another description of Ti,t, which will be

used later.

Proposition 4.8. For any 1 ≤ i ≤ n and t ≥ 0, there exist 1 ≤ j ≤ n and 0 ≤ s ≤ (n + 1 − j)d
such that Ti,t = Aj[s] in CM A.

Proof. First notice that Ti,0 = Ai and Ti,t can be deﬁned by applying induction on t by the
following triangle in Db(A).

Ti,t+1

ft−→ Ti,t[d] → Pi,t → Ti,t+1[1],

where ft is the minimal right (CM A)-approximation of Ti,t[d] and Pi,t ∈ per A. Also notice that for
any Aj [s] ∈ CM A, the minimal right (CM A)-approximation of Aj[s+ d] also has the form of Aj′ [s′]
for some 1 ≤ j′ ≤ n and 0 ≤ s′ ≤ (n + 1 − j′)d. Then the assertion can be shown inductively. (cid:3)

Theorem 4.2 implies that CMA is a cluster category. In fact we have the following result.

Theorem 4.9. The stable category CMA is triangle equivalent to Cd+1(An).

The key ingredient of the proof is Keller and Reiten’s result [KR]. We ﬁrst show CMA admits

a (d + 1)-cluster tilting object.

18

Proposition 4.10. Let T :=
i=1 Ai, then T is a (d + 1)-cluster-tilting object in CMA, that is,
add T is functorially ﬁnite in CMA and X ∈ add T if and only if HomCMA(T, X[m]) = 0 for all
1 ≤ m ≤ d.

L

We show the following lemma ﬁrst.

Lemma 4.11. (1) T is a (d + 1)-rigid object in CMA, i.e. HomCMA(Ai, Aj[s]) = 0 for any 1 ≤

i, j ≤ n and 1 ≤ s ≤ d;

(2) HomCMA(Ai, Aj[−s]) = 0 for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and 1 ≤ s ≤ d − 1;
(3) Let M ∈ CM A. Assume HomCMA(Ai, M [m]) = 0 for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ m ≤ d. If

H0(M ) = 0, then M = 0.

Proof. By Proposition 2.6, we have HomCMA(Ai, Aj [s]) = HomDb(A)(Ai, Aj[s]). Consider the fol-
lowing two triangles.

An−i+1[id] −→ A −→ Ai −→ An−i+1[id + 1] −→ A[1],

Ai[(n − i + 1)d] −→ A −→ An−i+1 −→ Ai[(n − i + 1)d + 1] −→ A[1].

(4.4)

(4.5)

If s > 1, by applying the functor HomDb(A)(?, Aj [s]) to triangle (4.4), we have
HomDb(A)(Ai, Aj[s]) = HomDb(A)(An−i+1[id + 1], Aj[s]).

Apply the functor HomDb(A)(?, Aj [s − id − 1]) to the triangle (4.5). Since
HomDb(A)(Ai[(n − i + 1)d + 1], Aj[s − id − 1]) = 0,

then

HomDb(A)(An−i+1, Aj[s − id − 1]) = 0.

Thus HomDb(A)(Ai, Aj[s]) = 0.

If s = 1. Apply the functor HomDb(A)(?, Aj [1]) to triangle (4.4). Notice that the induced map
HomDb(A)(A[1], Aj[1]) → HomDb(A)(An−i+1[id + 1], Aj[1])
is surjective. Then HomDb(A)(Ai, Aj[1]) = 0. So (1) is true. The proof of statement (2) is similar
to (1).

For (3), let M ∈ CM A. If M 6= 0 in CMA, let t := min{s ∈ Z | Hs(M ) 6= 0}. We may assume

−id ≤ t < −(i − 1)d. We will show HomCMA(Ai, M [t + id + 1]) 6= 0, which is a contradiction.

Since H≥0M = 0, then H0M [id + t] = 0. Apply the functor HomDb(A)(?, M [id + t + 1]) to (4.4),

we have

HomDb(A)(Ai, M [id + t + 1]) = HomDb(A)(An−i+1[id + 1], M [id + t + 1]).

Apply the functor HomDb(A)(?, M [t]) to (4.5), then

HomDb(A)(An−i+1, M [t]) = HomDb(A)(A, M [t]) = H0(M [t]).
Then HomCMA(Ai, M [id+t+1]) = HomDb(A)(Ai, M [id+t+1]) = H0(M [t]) 6= 0. It is contradictory
(cid:3)
to our assumption. So M = 0 ∈ CMA. Since M 6∈ add A by H0(M ) = 0, then M = 0.

Proof of Proposition 4.10. Since CMA is Hom-ﬁnite, then add T is a functorially ﬁnite subcategory
of CMA. Let 0 6= M ∈ ind CM A. Then M = A or M = Aj[s] for some 1 ≤ j ≤ n and
0 ≤ s ≤ (n + 1 − j)d by Theorem 4.2 and Proposition 4.8. Assume HomCMA(Ai, M [m]) = 0 for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ m ≤ d. Then by Lemma 4.11, we have H0(M ) 6= 0. So M ∈ add T . Then
(cid:3)
T is a (d + 1)-cluster-tilting object in CMA.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 4.9.

Proof of Theorem 4.9. Since dim HomCMA(Ai, Aj) = 0 for i > j and dim HomCMA(Ai, Aj) = 1
for i ≤ j, the endomorphism algebra EndCMA(T ) is isomorphic to a path algebra kQ, where Q is
the quiver of type An with linear orientation. By Proposition 4.10, T is a (d + 1)-cluster-tilting
object in CMA. Moreover, by Lemma 4.11, HomCMA(Ai, Aj[−k]) = 0 for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and
∼
−→ Cd+1(An). (cid:3)
1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1. Then by [KR, Theorem 4.2], there is a triangle equivalence CMA

5. Negative Calabi-Yau configurations and combinatorial configurations

5.1. Negative Calabi-Yau conﬁgurations. In this subsection, we introduce negative Calabi-
Yau conﬁgurations in the categorical framework.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category and let C be
a set of indecomposable objects of T . For d ≥ 1, we call C a (−d)-Calabi-Yau conﬁguration (or
(−d)-CY conﬁguration) if the following conditions hold.
(1) dimk HomT (X, Y ) = δX,Y for X, Y ∈ C;
(2) HomT (X, Y [−j]) = 0 for any two objects X, Y in C and 0 < j ≤ d − 1;
(3) For any indecomposable object M in T , there exists X ∈ C and 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, such that

HomT (X, M [−j]) 6= 0.
If T admits a Serre functor S, then by Serre duality, (3) is equivalent to the following condition.
(3op) For any indecomposable object N in T , there exists X ∈ C and 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, such that

HomT (N, X[−j]) 6= 0.

Deﬁnition 5.2. As in Deﬁnition 5.1, we call C a pre-d-simple-minded system (or pre-d-SMS ), if
it only satisﬁes (1), (2) above, and call C a d-simple-minded system (or d-SMS ) if it satisﬁes (1),
(2) above and
(3′) T = add Filt{C, C[1], · · · , C[d − 1]}.

It is easy to see that “d-SMS” implies “(−d)-CY conﬁguration”. We show that if T admits
a Serre functor S, then any (−d)-CY conﬁguration in T is preserved by the functor S[d]. This
property motivates the name “(−d)-CY conﬁguration”.

Theorem 5.3. Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category with Serre
functor S. Let C be a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in T , then SC[d] = C.

Remark 5.4. For the case d = 1, Riedtmann showed the periodicity of conﬁgurations for type
An and Dn in combinatorial setting (see [Rie2, Rie4]).

To prove the theorem above, we need the following well-known property.

Lemma 5.5. Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite triangulated category with Serre functor S. Let X ∈ T
with EndT (X) = k and f ∈ HomT (X, SX). Then for any Y ∈ T and g ∈ HomT (SX, Y ) which is
not a section, we have g ◦ f = 0.

Proof. We have the following commutative diagram.

HomT (X, SX)

HomT (X,g)

HomT (X, Y )

.

≃

≃

D HomT (SX, SX)

D HomT (g,SX)

D HomT (Y, SX)

Since the lower map is zero by EndT (SX) = k and the assumption that g is not a section, so is
(cid:3)
the upper one.

Proof of Theorem 5.3. The proof falls into two parts.

(a) We ﬁrst prove S[d]C ⊂ C. For any X ∈ C, we only need to show S[d]X ∈ C. By condition

(3), there exist Y ∈ C and 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 such that HomT (Y, S[d]X[−i]) 6= 0. Since

HomT (Y, S[d]X[−i]) = D HomT (X, Y [−d + i])
If 0 < i ≤ d − 1, it is zero by condition (2). So we must have i = 0. Let f : Y → S[d]X be a
non-zero morphism and consider the triangle extended by f ,

We claim that N = 0.

If N 6= 0, then there exist Z ∈ C and 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, such that HomT (Z, N [−j]) 6= 0. Let
p ∈ HomT (Z[j], N ) be a non-zero morphism. If g ◦ p 6= 0, then j = 0 and g ◦ p is an isomorphism
by Deﬁnition 5.1(1)(2). Thus g is a retraction and f = 0, a contradiction. So g ◦ p = 0. Then
there exists a morphism q : Z[j] → SX[d − 1], such that p = h ◦ q.

1]) = D HomT (X, Z[j − d + 1]) and Deﬁnition 5.1(1)(2). Then by Lemma 5.5, we know h is a
section. Thus f = 0, a contradiction. So N = 0 and SX[d] ∼= Y ∈ C.

(b) We prove S[d]C ⊃ C. By considering conditions (1), (2), and (3op), one can show the
(cid:3)

statement easily, which is similar to the proof in part (a). We leave it to the reader.

5.2. CM dg modules and CY conﬁgurations. In this subsection, we study CY conﬁgurations
in the stable categories of Cohen-Macaulay dg modules over d-self-injective dg algebras. In this
case, we show that the set of simple dg A-modules forms a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in CMA, which
generalizes Riedtmann’s result [Rie2, Proposition 2.4].

Recall from Section 1.3, for a non-positive dg k-algebra A with A>0 = 0, we may regard H0(A)-
modules as dg A-modules via the homomorphism A → H0(A). Let {S1, . . . , Sr} be the set of
simple H0(A)-modules. We also regard them as simple dg A-modules (when we talk about simple
modules, we always assume they are concentrated in degree zero part). Recall that if A is a
d-self-injective dg algebra, then CM A = Db

≥−d+1 (see Proposition 2.3).

≤0 ∩ Db

The main result in this subsection is the following.

Theorem 5.6. Let A be a d-self-injective dg k-algebra with d ≥ 0. Then the set of simple modules
{Si | 1 ≤ i ≤ r} is a d-SMS of CMA, and hence a (−d)-CY conﬁguration of CMA.

To prove this theorem, we start with the following lemma ﬁrst.

Lemma 5.7. Let M ∈ CM A. If d > 1, then for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and 0 ≤ t ≤ d − 2, we have
(1) HomCM A(Si[t], A) = 0
(2) HomCMA(Si[t], M ) = HomCM A(Si[t], M ).

Proof. We only prove (1), since (2) is immediately from (1). Since DA = A[−d + 1] in DA, then
HomCM A(Si[t], A) = HomCM A(Si[t − d + 1], DA) = DHt−d+1(Si) = 0

for 0 ≤ t ≤ d − 2.

Now we prove Theorem 5.6.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 5.6. If d = 1, then A is an ordinary self-injective k-algebra and the assertion is
known. We only prove it for d > 1. By Lemma 5.7 and Proposition 1.6, we have

HomCMA(Si, Sj) = HomCM A(Si, Sj) = HomH0(A)(Si, Sj),

where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r. So the condition (1) in Deﬁnition 5.1 holds. Since CM A = Db
≥−d+1 and
HomDb(A)(Si[> 0], Sj) = 0, then we have Si[t] ∈ CM A for 1 ≤ t ≤ d−1 and HomCM A(Si[t], Sj) = 0.
Thus HomCMA(Si[t], Sj) = 0 and the condition (2) in Deﬁnition 5.1 is true. Now we show the
condition (3′) holds. By Propositions 2.3 and 1.6, we have

≤0 ∩ Db

CM A = FiltS[d − 1] ∗ FiltS[d − 2] ∗ · · · ∗ FiltS,

Proposition 5.8. Let A be a d-self-injective dg k-algebra. Let P ∈ add A be an indecomposable
dg A-module. Then rad P is an indecomposable object in CM A and it does not belong to add A.

Proof. Since A is d-self-injective, then CM A = Db
≥−d+1(A). So rad P ∈ CM A. We
have a natural functor H : D(A) → Mod H(A) by taking cohomology, where Mod H(A) is the
category of graded H(A)-modules. Notice that H(A) is a self-injective graded algebra and H(P )
is an indecomposable projective-injective graded H(A)-module. So H(rad P ) = rad(H(P )) is an
indecomposable graded H(A)-module and it does not belong to add H(A). Then the assertion is

true.

5.3. Combinatorial conﬁgurations. We give a combinatorial interpretation of Calabi-Yau con-
ﬁgurations of Dynkin type in our combinatorial framework.

Let ∆ be a Dynkin diagram. Recall from [G] that a slice of Z∆ (see Section 1.6 for the deﬁnition
of Z∆) is a connected full subquiver which contains a unique representatives of the vertices (r, q),
r ∈ Z for each q ∈ ∆0. For each vertex x = (p, q) of Z∆, there is a unique slice admitting x as
its unique source. We call this slice the slice starting at x. An integer-valued function f on the
vertices of Z∆ is additive if it satisﬁes the equation f (x) + f (τ x) =
f (y). It is easy to
see that f is determined by its value on a slice. Now we deﬁne fx as the additive function which
has value 1 on the slice starting at x for each vertex x. Let Qx be the connected component of the
full subquiver {y ∈ (Z∆)0 | fx(y) > 0} of Z∆ containing x. We deﬁne a map hx by

y→x∈(Z∆)1

P

hx(y) =

fx(y)
0

(

if y ∈ (Qx)0;
otherwise.

Notice that hx is no longer an additive map. Let us see an example of type D.

Let φ be a weakly admissible automorphism (see Section 1.6) of Z∆. Let π : Z∆ → Z∆/φ be

the natural projection. For x ∈ Z∆, we deﬁne hφ

x as follows

hφ
x(y) =

hx(z) for y ∈ (Z∆/φ)0

Xπ(z)=y

If φ is identity, then hφ is exactly h. Recall we have deﬁned the “shift permutation” [1] in section
1.6. Now we use hφ

x and [1] to deﬁne combinatorial conﬁgurations.

Deﬁnition 5.10. Let ∆ be a Dynkin diagram and let φ be a weakly admissible group. Let C be
a subset of (Z∆/φ)0. For d ≥ 1, if the following conditions hold
• hφ
• hφ
• For any vertex z in (Z∆/φ)0, there exists x ∈ C and 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, such that hφ
we call C a (−d)-combinatorial conﬁguration.

x(y) = δx,y for x, y ∈ C;
x(y[−j]) = 0 for x, y ∈ C and 0 < j ≤ d − 1;

x(z[−j]) 6= 0.

The connection between conﬁgurations of Z∆ and conﬁgurations of Z∆/φ is given as follows.

5.4. Calabi-Yau conﬁgurations VS. combinatorial conﬁgurations. In this section we study
the connection between Calabi-Yau conﬁgurations and combinatorial conﬁgurations. Let T be
a Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category with AR quiver isomorphic to Z∆/S[d]. We
identify the elements in ind T as the vertices in Z∆/S[d]. Let π : Z∆ → Z∆/S[d] be the natural
surjection. We denote by ¯h for the map hS[d]. We ﬁrst show that

Proposition 5.13. For any X, Y ∈ ind T , we have dim HomT (X, Y ) = ¯hX (Y ).

To prove this, we consider the free Abelian monoid N≥0(Z∆) generated by (Z∆)0. For any

n ∈ N≥0 and x ∈ (Z∆)0, we deﬁne a map fn(x) : N≥0(Z∆) → N≥0(Z∆) by

(2) C is a (−d)-combinatorial conﬁguration in Z∆/S[d + 1].

Proof. It directly follows from Proposition 5.13.

(cid:3)

Thanks to the theorem above, by abuse of notation, we may use the name “Calabi-Yau conﬁg-

uration” even in the combinatorial context.

6. Trivial extension dg algebras

In this section, we consider a class of self-injective dg algebras given by trivial extension. Some
results here will be used to prove a certain converse of Theorem 5.6 (see Theorem 7.1). Let B
be a non-positive proper dg k-algebra. Let inf(B) be the smallest integer i such that Hi(B) 6= 0.
Clearly, inf(B) ≤ 0. For d ∈ Z, we consider the complex A := B ⊕ DB[d]. We regard A as a dg
k-algebra whose multiplication is given by

(a, f )(b, g) := (ab, ag + f b)

where a, b ∈ B and f, g ∈ DB, and the diﬀerential of A inherits from B and DB. If d ≥ − inf(B),
then A is non-positive. Moreover, we have an isomorphism DA ≃ A[−d] in DAe. If inf(B) = 0
and d = 0, A is the usual trivial extension.

We give a result analogous to [Ric, Theorem 3.1].

Proposition 6.1. Let B be a non-positive proper dg k-algebra and let X be a silting object in
:= EndB(X). Consider the trivial extension dg algebras A = B ⊕ DB[d] and
per B. Let B′
A′ = B′ ⊕ DB′[d], then per A is triangle equivalent to per A′.

Proof. We may regard A as a dg B-module through the injection B ֒→ A. Consider the functor

? ⊗

L
B A : per B −→ per A.

It sends B to A. Since thickB(X) = per B, then thickA(X ⊗B A) = per A. Then X ⊗B A is a
compact generator of DA and we have a triangle equivalence between per End(X ⊗B A) and per A
(see for example [Ke1, Lemma 4.2]) . Next we consider the dg algebra End(X ⊗B A). Notice that,
as k-complexes, we have the following isomorphisms.

H omA(X ⊗B A, X ⊗B A) ≃ H omB(X, X ⊕ (X ⊗B DB[d])) ≃ EndB(X) ⊕ DEndB(X)[d].
In fact these isomorphisms also induce an isomorphism between dg algebras End(X ⊗B A) and
EndB(X) ⊕ DEndB(X)[d]. Then EndA(X ⊗B A) is isomorphic to A′ = B′ ⊕ DB′[d]. So per A is
(cid:3)
triangle equivalent to per A′.

In the sequel, we only consider the special case that inf(B) = 0 and B has ﬁnite global dimension.
In this case, A is a Gorenstein proper dg k-algebra. If A′ considered in Proposition 6.1 is also
Gorenstein proper, then we have CMA ≃ CMA′ by the result above. We show CMA is a cluster
category in the following sense. For the details of orbit category, we refer to [Ke2].

24

HAIBO JIN

Deﬁnition 6.2. Let B be a ﬁnite dimensional hereditary k- algebra. The (−d)-cluster category
C−d(B) is deﬁned as the orbit category Db(modB)/ν[d], where ν is the Nakayama functor.

Keller proved the following result.

Proposition 6.3. [Ke2, Theorem 2][Ke4] Let B be a ﬁnite-dimensional hereditary k-algebra. Let
A = B ⊕ DB[d − 1] be the trivial extension dg algebra. Then
(1) C−d(B) has a structure of triangulated category;
(2) C−d(B) is triangle equivalent to Dsg(A).

Notice that in this case Dsg(A) = thickA(B)/ per A holds by the fact thickA(B) = Db(A) (see
Proposition 1.5). By using this proposition, we have a useful observation, where we denote by
A(CMA) the AR quiver of CMA.

Corollary 6.4. Let B be a ﬁnite-dimensional hereditary k-algebra and let A = B ⊕ DB[d − 1] for
d ≥ 1. Then
(1) The stable category CMA is triangle equivalent to C−d(B);
(2) We have A(CMA) = A(Db(mod B)/ν[d]) = Z∆/ν[d]. In particular, A(mod B) is a full sub-

quiver of A(CMA).

We end this section with a concrete example.

Example 6.5. Let B be the k-algebra given by the quiver 1 → 2 ← 3. Let A = B ⊕ DB[1]
be the trivial extension dg k-algebra. Then we may regard A as the dg k-algebra given by

, with relations {α1α2α1, β1β2β1, α1β2, β1α2, α2α1 − β2β1} and 0 diﬀerential.

Further, the degrees of A are induced by deg α1 = 0 = deg β1, deg α2 = −1 = deg β2. By Corollary
6.4, we know the CMA is triangle equivalent to Db(mod B)/ν[2]. We describe A(CMA) as follows.

7. CY configurations and symmetric dg algebras

The aim of this section is to show the following theorem, which is the converse of Theorem 5.6.
Theorem 7.1. Let ∆ be a Dynkin diagram and d ≥ 1. Let C be a subset of vertices of Z∆/S[d].
The following are equivalent.
(1) C is a (−d)-CY conﬁguration;
(2) There exists a d-symmetric dg k-algebra A with the AR quiver of CMA is (Z∆)C /S[d].

To prove this, we need some preparations. We ﬁrst study the connection between simple-minded

collections (SMCs) in Db(A) and (−d)-CY conﬁgurations in CMA.

7.1. (−d)-CY conﬁgurations are given by SMCs. To prove Theorem 7.1, we need the follow-
ing notion.

Deﬁnition 7.2. Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category and let R
be a set of objects of T . We call R a pre-simple-minded collection (pre-SMC ) of T , if for any
X, Y ∈ R, the following conditions hold.
• dimk HomT (X, Y ) = δX,Y .
• HomT (X, Y [< 0]) = 0.

Moreover, if T = thickT (R) also holds, we call R a simple-minded collection (SMC ) of T .

In this subsection, our aim is to show the following result, which plays a key role in the proof

of Theorem 7.1.

Theorem 7.3. Let ∆ be a Dynkin diagram. Let A = k∆ ⊕ D(k∆)[d − 1] be the trivial extension
dg k-algebra. Then the quotient functor Db(A) → Dsg(A) ∼= CMA induces a surjective map

{SMCs in Db(A)} −→ {(−d)-CY conﬁgurations in CMA}.

Notice that in this setting, the notion ‘d-SMS’ coincides with ‘(−d)-CY conﬁguration’ by [CSP,
Proposition 2.13], since CM A has only ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects. So we may regard
(−d)-CY conﬁguration and d-SMS as the same notion later in this section.

Let R be a pre-SMC of Db(A). The SMC reduction U of Db(A) with respect to R is deﬁned as

the Verdier quotient (see [Ji, Section 3.1])

U := Db(A)/ thick(R).

Let E be a pre-d-SMS of Dsg(A). The SMS reduction (Dsg(A))E of Dsg(A) with respect to E is
deﬁned as the subcategory (see [CSP, Section 6])

(Dsg(A))E := {X ∈ Dsg | HomDsg(A)(X, Y [−i]) = 0 for any i = 0, 1, · · · , d and Y ∈ E}.

The following proposition shows some important properties of SMC and SMS reduction.

Proposition 7.4. (1) [Ji, Theorem 3.1] Let R be a pre-SMC of Db(A). Assume Filt(R) is func-

torially ﬁnite in Db(A). Then the natural functor Db(A) → U induces a bijection

{SMCs in Db(A) containing R} ←→ {SMCs in U};

(2) [CSP, Theorem 6.6] Let E be a pre-d-SMS of Dsg(A). Assume Filt(E) is functorially ﬁnite in
Dsg(A). Then the SMS reduction (Dsg(A))E has a structure of triangulated category and there
is a bijection

{d-SMSs in Dsg(A) containing E} ←→ {d-SMSs in (Dsg(A))E};

(3) [Ji, Corollary 4.15 and Proposition 5.1] Let A be a representation ﬁnite d-self-injective dg
algebra. Then the quotient functor Db(A) → Dsg(A) ∼= CMA induces a well-deﬁned map

{SMCs in Db(A)} −→ {d-SMSs in CMA}.

Now we are ready to show Theorem 7.3.

Proof of Theorem 7.3. We ﬁrst mention that CMA is triangle equivalent to the orbit category
Db(mod k∆)/ν[d] and the AR quiver of CMA is Z∆/S[d] by Corollary 6.4. Moreover, we may
assume ∆ has an alternating orientation (that is, each vertex in ∆ is either sink or source). We
apply induction on the number n of vertices of ∆.
In this case, any
indecomposable object in CMA is a shift of the simple object and the argument is clearly true.

If n = 1, then ∆ = A1.

For the general case, let C be a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in CMA. Since the quiver ∆ has an
alternating orientation, each τ -orbit in the AR quiver of mod k∆ contains a simple k∆-module.
Then by Corollary 6.4 (2), there exists a simple dg A-module S and an integer s, such that τ sS ∈ C
in CMA. Notice that τ = S[−1] and S = [−d], so we have S[t] ∈ C, where t = −sd. Without loss
of generality, in the following we may assume S ∈ C.

It is clear that {S} is a pre-SMC in Db(A), and the SMC reduction Db(A)/ thick(S) is triangle
equivalent to Db(eAe) by [Ji, Proposition 3.9], where e ∈ k∆ is an idempotent such that top(1 −
e)A = S. Considering the SMS reduction (Dsg(A))S of Dsg(A) with respect to S, then by [Ji,
Theorem 6.4], we have a triangle equivalence Dsg(eAe) ≃ (Dsg(A))S and the following commutative

26

diagram.

.

≃

{SMCs in Db(eAe)}

/ {d-SMSs in Dsg(eAe)}

Notice that eAe ∼= k∆′ ⊕D(k∆′)[d−1], where ∆′ is obtained from ∆ by deleting the vertex i, which
corresponds to S, and the arrows connected to i. Then ∆′ also has an alternating orientation and
has n − 1 vertices. By induction, we may assume the lower map is surjective. Since C is a (−d)-CY
conﬁguration in Dsg(A) containing S, then C\{S} is a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in (Dsg(A))S by
Proposition 7.4 (2). So there is a SMC H of Db(eAe) such that H ∼= C\{S} in Dsg(eAe). We may
regard H as a subset of Db(A)/ thick(S) through Db(eAe) ≃ Db(A)/ thick(S). Then H ∪ {S} is a
SMC of Db(A) by Proposition 7.4 (1). By the diagram above, we have that H ∪ {S} sends to C in
(cid:3)
Dsg(A). By induction, the assertion is true.

7.2. Proof of Theorem 7.1. To prove our main theorem, we need the following generalization
of silting-SMC correspondence [KoY, Theorem 6.1] due to [SY].

Proposition 7.5. [SY, Theorem 1.1] Let A be a non-positive proper dg k-algebra. Then

(1) There is a bijection

{SMCs of Db(A)} ←→ {silting objects of per A};

(2) Let {X1, · · · , Xn} be a SMC of Db(A) which corresponds to a silting P ∈ per A. Let B :=
B P : Db(B) →

EndA(P ) be the endmoprhism dg k-algebra. Then the natural equivalence ? ⊗L
Db(A) sends simple B-modules to {X1, · · · , Xn}.

We also need the following observation.

Lemma 7.6. Let A be a proper dg k-algebra and let P be a silting dg A-modules. Let B :=
EndA(P ). Then if A is d-symmetric, so is B.

Proof. Let A be a d-symmetric dg k-algebra, that is add A[−d + 1] = add DA in D(Aop ⊗k A). We
may assume DA ∼= A[−d + 1] in D(Aop ⊗k A). We may also assume DA and A have property (P)
as (Aop ⊗k A)-modules and P has property (P) as (Bop ⊗k A)-module (see [Ke1, Section 3.1]).
Then there is a quasi-isomorphim f : A → DA[d − 1] of (Aop ⊗k A)-modules, which induces a
quasi-isomorphism 1 ⊗ f : P → P ⊗A DA[d − 1] of (Bop ⊗k A)-modules.

Applying the functor H omA(P, ?), we have a quasi-isomorphism B → H omA(P, P ⊗ADA[d−1])

of Bop ⊗k B-modules. Notice that we have an isomorphism

H omA(P, P ⊗A DA[d − 1]) ∼= DH omA(P, P )[d − 1] = DB[d − 1]

of (Bop ⊗k B)-modules, then B ∼= DB[d − 1] in D(B). Thus B is also d-symmetric.

(cid:3)

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 7.1.

Proof of Theorem 7.1. Let C be a (−d)-CY conﬁguration of Z∆/S[d]. Let A = k∆ ⊕ D(k∆)[d − 1]
be the trivial extension dg algebra. We may regard C as a (−d)-CY conﬁguration in CMA. There
is a SMC {X1, · · · , Xn} in Db(A) which is sent to C in CMA by Theorem 7.3 and there exists
a silting object P in per A corresponds to {X1, · · · , Xn} by Proposition 7.5. Let B = EndA(P ).
Then B is a d-symmetric dg k-algebra by Lemma 7.6 and moreover, CMB is triangle equivalent to
CMA. By Proposition 7.5, the simple modules of B corresponds to {X1, · · · , Xn}. Then the AR
(cid:3)
quiver of CMB is isomorphic to (Z∆)C /S[d].

8. Maximal d-Brauer relations and Brauer tree dg algebras

In the section, we give a combinatorial proof of Theorem 7.1 for the case ∆ = An. We will
see in An case, there is a very nice description of (−d)-CY conﬁgurations by maximal d-Brauer
relations. We develop some technical concepts and results on them. Then we introduce Brauer
tree dg algebras from maximal d-Brauer relations and we show the simples of such dg algebras
correspond to the given CY conﬁgurations.

8.1. Maximal d-Brauer relations. We start with the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 8.1. Let d ≥ 1 and n > 0 be two integers and let N := (d + 1)n + d − 1. Let Π be an
N -gon with vertices numbered clockwise from 1 to N .
(1) A diagonal in Π is a straight line segment that joins two of the vertices and goes through the
interior of Π. The diagonal which joins two vertices i and j is denoted by (i, j) = (j, i).

(2) A d-diagonal in Π is a diagonal of the form (i, i + d + j(d + 1)), where 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1.

The deﬁnition of maximal d-Brauer relation is as follows. It is some special kind of 2-Brauer

relation in the sense of [L, Deﬁnition 6.1].

Deﬁnition 8.2. Let B be a set of d-diagonals in Π. We call B a d-Brauer relation of Π if any
two d-diagonals in B are disjoint. We call a d-Brauer relation B maximal, if it is maximal with
respect to inclusions.

We denote by B the set of maximal d-Brauer relations on Π. Let θ be the clockwise rotation
by 2π/N . If I = (i1, i2) is a diagonal, then θt(I) = (i1 + t, i2 + t) gives us a new diagonal. For
any B, B′ ∈ B, if there exists n ∈ Z such that B = θn(B′), we say B and B′ are equivalent up to
rotation, denoting by B ∼ B′. It gives rise to an equivalence relation on B. We denote by B the
set of equivalence classes of B. We give two simple examples to show what the maximal d-Brauer
relations look like.

Example 8.3. Let d = 2 and n = 2. Then N = 7 and B consists of the following and #B = 1.

(i, j) to (i + N, j + N ) if d is odd, and to (j + N, i + N ) if d is even, then we may label ZAn,d by
taking the labelling in Z/N Z × Z/N Z, where we identify (i, j) and (j, i). Let us see some examples.

By the labelling above, we have the following theorem. This result has been show in [CS2],
we put a new proof in Appendix by using concepts developed here. Let C be the set of (−d)-CY
conﬁgurations in ZAn,d.

Theorem 8.6. [CS2, Theorem 6.5]
(1) There is a bijection between the vertices of ZAn,d and the d-diagonals in Π sending the vertex

(i, j) of ZAn,d to the diagonal (i, j) of Π.

(2) The bijection in (1) gives a bijection between C and B;
(3) Any (−d)-CY conﬁguration in ZAn,d contains exactly n elements.

We give an example to show how the bijection works.

Example 8.7. Let n = 2 and d = 2. We associate to each vertex of ZA2,1 a label in Z/7Z × Z/7Z
as following:

It is easy to check the set {(4, 6), (7, 2)} is a (−2)-CY conﬁguration of ZA2,1 and it gives rise to

a maximal d-Brauer relation of 7-gon as follows (left part):

On the other hand, any maximal d-Brauer relation, for example {(2, 4), (7, 5)}, gives us a (−2)-

The following lemma is immediately from the deﬁnition.

Lemma 8.8. Let X ∈ ZAn,d with labelling (x1, x2). Then X[1] = (x2 + 1, x1 + 1) and X[1] = θ(X)
as d-diagonals.

In the rest of this subsection, we introduce some technical concepts and results. They give us a
better understanding of maximal d-Brauer relations and in particular, Proposition 8.16 will play
a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 8.32.

Deﬁnition 8.9. (1) Let C be a set of diagonals in Π. We call C a cycle if C is contained in the
X∈C X of Π. In this

closure of some connect component (denoted by ΠC ) of the subset Π\
case, elements in C has a anti-clockwise ordering C = {X1, · · · , Xs} given as follows.

(2) Let B ∈ B and C ⊂ B. We call C a B-cycle if C is a cycle and {X ∈ B | X ∈ ΠC } = C.

Example 8.10. Let d = 2 and n = 4. Let B be the following maximal d-Brauer relation.

By the deﬁnition above, C = {(2, 4), (5, 7), (10, 12)} is a cycle but not a B-cycle and C′ =
{(2, 4), (5, 7), (1, 9)} is a B-cycle.

Here are some elementary properties of these concepts. The proof is left to the reader.

Proposition 8.11. Let B ∈ B, then
(1) B is the union of B-cycles;
(2) Any two B-cycles have at most one common diagonal;
(3) Let C := {X1, . . . , Xs} be a set of diagonals in Π. Let Xs+1 := X1. Then C is a cycle if and
only if for any i, 2 ≤ i ≤ s, Xi−1 and Xi+1 are in the same connect component of Π\Xi
(4) Let X, Y ∈ B. Then X and Y are in the same B-cycle if and only if for any Z 6= X, Y in B,

X and Y are in the same connected component part of Π\Z

(5) Let X, Y, Z ∈ B. X and Y are in the same connected component of Π\Z if and only if there
is a sequence X = X1, X2, · · · , Xt = Y of B, such that Y 6= Xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ t and Xj, Xj+1 are
in the same B-cycle for 1 ≤ j ≤ t − 1.

We give an easy observation.

Lemma 8.12. Let B ∈ B and X ∈ B. Let Π1 and Π2 be two connect components of Π\X. Then
(1) B ∩ Πi := {Y ∈ B | Y ⊂ Πi} is a maximal d-Brauer relation of Πi for i = 1, 2;
(2) If X has the form (i, i + d + 1 + (d + 2)j), then {#B ∩ Π1, #B ∩ Π2} = {j, n − j − 1}.

Let X and Y be two disjoint d-diagonals. We denote by δ(X, Y ) the smallest positive integer

m such that θ−m(X) ∩ Y 6= ∅.
Remark 8.13. Let X, Y ∈ ZAn,d. If X and Y are disjoint as d-diagonals, then δ(X, Y ) = min{i >
0 | ¯hX (Y [i]) 6= 0} by Lemma 8.8.

We will give a description of B-cycles by δ. Before this, we show a lemma. Let Ss be the

permutation group.

Lemma 8.14. Let B ∈ B and let C ⊂ B be a cycle with anti-clockwise ordering {X1, · · · , Xs}.
Let ΠC be the connect component of Π\C given in Deﬁnition 8.9. Let Xs+1 = X1. Then the
following statement holds.
(1) Let m = #(B ∩ ΠC ), then

s
l=1 δ(Xl, Xl+1) = d + s + (d + 1)m − 1;

(2) For any τ ∈ Ss, we have

s
l=1 δ(Xτ (l), Xτ (l+1)) ≥ d + s + (d + 1)m − 1. Moreover, the equality

holds if and only if τ (l + 1) = τ (l) + 1 for all 1 ≤ l ≤ s;

P
(3) C is a B-cycle if and only if

s
l=1 δ(Xl, Xl+1) = d + s − 1.
Proof. (1) Assume Xi has the form (xi, yi) as follows, where yi = xi+d+(d+1)ji with 0 ≤ ji ≤ n−1.

Since by deﬁnition, δ(Xi, Xi+1) = 1+ the number of vertices between Xi and Xi+1 (anti-clockwise),
s
l=1 δ(Xl, Xl+1) = s + #ΠC . We count Π\ΠC ﬁrst. By our labelling, it is easy to see the

l=1 δ(Xl, Xl+1) = s + d + (d + 1)(n −

The following proposition gives us a useful criterion for being B-cycle.

Proposition 8.15. Let B ∈ B and let C be a subset of B. Then C is a B-cycle if and only if
s
l=1 δ(Xl, Xl+1) = d + s − 1, where Xs+1 = X1.
there is a numbering C = {X1, . . . , Xs} such that
In this case, {X1, . . . , Xs} is an anti-clockwise ordering or C.

P

Proof. The “only if” part. Assume C is a B-cycle with anti-clockwise ordering {X1, · · · , Xl}, then
by Lemma 8.14 (1),

s
l=1 δ(Xl, Xl+1) = d + s − 1.

The “if” part. To prove C is a B-cycle, it suﬃces to show C is a cycle by Lemma 8.14 (2) and
(3). If it is not true, then by Proposition 8.11 (3), there exists some i, 2 ≤ i ≤ s, such that Xi−1
and Xi+1 are in diﬀerent connect components of Π\Xi as follows.

P

Xi+1

Xi

Xi−1

In this case, we have

δ(Xi−1, Xi) + δ(Xi, Xi+1) = δ(Xi−1, Xi+1).

(8.1)
Now consider the new set C′ := C\Xi. If it is a cycle, then it is clear that Xi ∈ B ∩ ΠC ′, where
ΠC ′ is the connected component given in Deﬁnition 8.9 (1). Then #B ∩ ΠC ′ ≥ 1 and by Lemma
8.14 (2), the following inequality holds.

δ(Xl, Xl+1) + δ(Xi−1, Xi+1) +

δ(Xl, Xl+1) ≥ 2d + s − 1.

Notice that by equation (8.1), the left hand of (8.2) equals d + s − 1. Then d + s − 1 ≥ 2d + s − 1,
a contradiction. If C′ is not a cycle, we do the same thing on C′ as on C, and after ﬁnite steps,
(cid:3)
we get a contradiction. Thus C is a cycle, therefore a B-cycle.

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

Let B ∈ B. Then B is determined by B-cycles in the following sense.

Proposition 8.16. Let B, B′ ∈ B and let φ : B → B′ be a bijective map. If for any B-cycle C
with anti-clockwise ordering C = {X1, · · · , Xs}, we have δ(Xi, Xi+1) = δ(φ(Xi), φ(Xi+1)). Then
φ is the restriction of θn for some integer n, that is, B is isomorphic to B′ up to rotation.

To prove this proposition, we need prepare several lemmas.

Lemma 8.17. Let B, B′ and φ as above. Let C = {X1, · · · , Xs} be a subset of B. The following
are equiavlent.
(1) C = {X1, · · · , Xs} is a B-cycle with anti-clockwise ordering;
(2) φ(C) = {φ(X1), · · · , φ(Xs)} is a B′-cycle with anti-clockwise ordering.

Proof. (1) to (2). If C = {X1, · · · , Xs} is a B-cycle with anti-clockwise ordering, then

Then by Proposition 8.15, φ(C) = {φ(X1), · · · , φ(Xs)} is a B′-cycle with anti-clockwise ordering.
(2) to (1). It is suﬃces to show if φ(Xi) and φ(Xj) are in the same B′-cycle, then so are Xi
and Xj. If it is not true, then by Proposition 8.11, there exists Y ∈ B, such that Xi and Xj are
(cid:3)
in diﬀerent connected component of Π\Y , which is contradict to Lemma 8.18 below.

Lemma 8.18. Let X, Y, Z ∈ B. Then X, Y are in the same connected component of Π\Z if and
only if φ(X) and φ(Y ) are in the same connected component of Π\φ(Z).

Proof. It is immediately from Proposition 8.11 (5) and Lemma 8.17 (1) to (2) part.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 8.16. We ﬁrst show for any X in B, X and φ(X) have the same length. Let
X = (x, x + d + (d + 1)j) ∈ B, 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1. Let Π1 and Π2 be the connected components of
Π\X. By Lemma 8.12, j is determined by the set {#B ∩ Π1, #B ∩ Π2}. Since by Lemma 8.18,
2}, then φ(X) has the form (x′, x′ + d + (d + 1)j),
{#B ∩ Π1, #B ∩ Π2} = {#B′ ∩ Π′
where Π′
2 are the connected components of B′\φ(X). So there is an integer n, such that
φ(X) = θn(X).

1, #B′ ∩ Π′

1 and Π′

We claim θn(B) = B′. Let C = {X = X1, · · · , Xs} be a B-cycle. Since δ(Xi, Xi+1) =
δ(φ(Xi), φ(Xi+1)), then φ(C) = θn(C). For any Y ∈ B, Y and X are connected by a series of
(cid:3)
B-cycles, thus θn(B) = φ(B) holds.

8.2. The cardinality of maximal d-Brauer relations. In this section, we compute the cardinal-
ity of maximal Brauer relations. Let d ≥ 1 and n > 0 be two integers. Let Π be a ((d+ 1)n+ d− 1)-
gon. Recall we denote by B the set of maximal d-Brauer relations on Π. We have the following

Let V := { subset V of vertices of Π such that #V = n }. Then the cardinality of V is

The main idea of the proof of Theorem 8.19 is to construct a surjective map from V to B. For
any V ∈ V, to construct a maximal d-Brauer relation corresponds to V , we need the following
observation.

Lemma 8.22. Let V = {v1, . . . , vn} ∈ V. Then for any vi ∈ V , there exists a d-diagonal with the
form (vi, vi + d + (d + 1)ai), 0 ≤ ai ≤ n − 1, such that

#{v ∈ V | vi < v < vi + d + (d + 1)ai} = ai

and vi + d + (d + 1)ai 6∈ V .

32

HAIBO JIN

Proof. Let bi ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1} be the biggest number such that vi + d + (d + 1)bi 6∈ V . Since
#V = n, then

#{v ∈ V | vi < v < vi + d + (d + 1)bi} ≤ bi.

On the other hand, we have

#{v ∈ V | vi < v < vi + d} ≥ 0.

So there exists 0 ≤ ai ≤ bi satisﬁes our conditions.

(cid:3)

For any vi ∈ V , let Jvi = (vi, wi := vi + d + (d + 1)ai) be the d-diagonal such that ai is the

smallest number satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma 8.22. We have the following result.

Proposition 8.23. Let V = {v1, . . . , vn} ∈ V. Then {Jv1, . . . , Jvn } deﬁned above is a maximal
d-Brauer relation on Π.

Before prove this proposition, we give some basic properties of Jvi ﬁrst.

Lemma 8.24. Let Jvi = (vi, wi = vi + d + (d + 1)ai) deﬁned as above, then
(1) For any 0 ≤ ci < ai, we have

#{v ∈ V | vi < v ≤ vi + d + (d + 1)ci} > ci.

(2)

#{v ∈ V | vi + d + (d + 1)(ai − 1) < v < vi + d + (d + 1)ai} = 0.

Proof. (1) If #{v ∈ V | vi < v ≤ vi + d + (d + 1)ci} ≤ ci, then we can ﬁnd 0 ≤ di ≤ ci, such that
di satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma 8.22, it contradicts the minimality of ai. Then the assertion
is true.

(2) By (1), we have #{v ∈ V | vi < v ≤ vi + d + (d + 1)(ai − 1)} > ai − 1. On the other hand,
(cid:3)

#{v ∈ V | vi < v < vi + d + (d + 1)ai} = ai, then the statement holds clearly.

Proof of Proposition 8.23. By Theorem 8.6, we only need to show that any two diagonals in
{Jv1, . . . , Jvn } are disjoint. Let vi, vj ∈ V .
If neither vj < vi < wj nor vi < vj < wi holds,
then it is clear Jvi and Jvj are disjoint. Otherwise, we may assume vj < vi < wj. It suﬃces to
show vj < ui < wj . We consider the following two cases.

If vj + d + (d + 1)bj < vi ≤ vj + d + (d + 1)(bj + 1), for some 0 ≤ bj < aj. By Lemma 8.24 (2),
we know that bj + 1 ≤ aj − 1. Consider the diagonal (vi, vi + d + (d + 1)(aj − bj − 2)), we claim
that

#{v ∈ V | vi < v ≤ vi + d + (d + 1)(aj − bj − 2)} ≤ aj − bj − 2.

Indeed by Lemma 8.24 (1),

and by the deﬁnition of wj ,

#{v ∈ V | vj < v ≤ vj + d + (d + 1)bj} > bj,

#{v ∈ V | vj < v < vj + d + (d + 1)ai} = ai.

Then #{v ∈ V | v 6= vi and vj + d + (d + 1)bj < v < wj} ≤ aj − bj − 2. So the claim is true and
ai ≤ aj − bj − 2 < aj. Then wi < wj and Jvi and Jvj are disjoint.

If vj < vi ≤ vj + d. Consider the diagonal (vi, vi + d + (d + 1)(aj − 1)).

It is clear that
#{v ∈ V | vi < v ≤ vi + d + (d + 1)(aj − 1)} ≤ aj − 1. Then ai ≤ aj − 1 < aj. So wi < wj.
Moreover, Yvi and Yvj are disjoint.

Thus {Jv1, . . . , Jvn } is a maximal d-Brauer relation.

(cid:3)

Now we can construct a map Θ : V −→ B by sending V ∈ V to Θ(V ) := {Jv | v ∈ V }. By

Proposition 8.23, it is well deﬁned. Next for B ∈ B, we need to determine the preimage of B.

Lemma 8.25. Let Θ be deﬁned as above. Then Θ is surjective. More precisely, for any B ∈ B,
we have #{V ∈ V | Θ(V ) = B} = n + 1.

Proof. Let B = {X1, . . . , Xn} be a maximal d-Brauer relation. Assume Xt has the form (xt, yt)
for 1 ≤ t ≤ n. Given any xt, we construct a set Vxt ∈ V as follows.

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

33

(1) For any 1 ≤ s ≤ n, one of xs and ys belongs to Vxt ;
(2) is ∈ Vit if and only if it ≤ is < js by clockwise ordering.
We construct Vyt in a similar way. It is easy to show Θ(Vxt ) = Θ(Vyt) = B. Then Θ is surjective.
We claim that #{Vxt, Vyt | 1 ≤ t ≤ n} = n + 1. We show this by induction. If n = 1, it is clear.
Assume the claim holds for n ≤ m − 1. For the case n = m. Let Π1 and Π2 be the two connect
components of Π\Xi. Assume yi = xi +d+(d+1)j, where 0 ≤ j ≤ n−1. By Lemma 8.12, B ∩Πl is
a maximal d-Brauer relation on Πl, 1 ≤ l ≤ 2 and moreover {#B ∩ Π1, #B ∩ Π2} = {m − j − 1, j}.
Then by induction, #{Vxt , Vyt | 1 ≤ t ≤ n} = (m − j − 1 + 1) + (j + 1) = m + 1. So the claim is
true.

For V ∈ Θ−1(B), by our construction of {Jv | v ∈ V }, one can show that V is given by some
(cid:3)

Vxt or Vyt . Thus by the claim above #{V ∈ V | Θ(V ) = B} = n + 1.

Theorem 8.19 is deduced by the Lemma 8.25 directly.

8.3. Brauer tree dg algebras. We ﬁrst introduce a graded quiver from given maximal d-Brauer
relation in the following way.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Deﬁnition 8.26. Let B ∈ B. The graded quiver QB associated to B is deﬁned as follows.
(1) The vertices of QB are given by the d-diagonals in B;
(2) For any B-cycle C with anti-clockwise ordering {X1, · · · , Xs}, we draw arrows Xi → Xi+1

with degree 1 − δ(Xi, Xi+1), where 1 ≤ i ≤ s and Xs+1 = X1.

We say a cycle in QB is minimal, if it is given by some B-cycle.

In Example 8.4, we give the maximal d-Brauer relations for the case d = 2 and n = 3. Now we

draw the d-Brauer quivers associate to them.

Example 8.27. Let d = 2 and n = 3. The graded quivers associate to the maximal d-Brauer
relations are as follows.

where the quivers are drawn by red lines and the numbers with red color are degrees correspond
to the arrows near them.

We give some basic properties on QB, which are induced by Proposition 8.11 and Lemma 8.14

(2).

Proposition 8.28. Let B ∈ B. Then QB satisﬁes the following
(1) Every vertex of Q belongs to one or two minimal cycles;
(2) Any two minimal cycles meet in one vertex at most;
(3) There are no loops in Q;
(4) Every arrow is equipped with a non-positive degree and the sum of degrees of each minimal

cycle is −d + 1.

Remark 8.29. The above properties (1), (2), (3) imply that QB a Brauer quiver in the sense of
Gabriel and Riedtmann (see [GR]).

Now we introduce the following main object in this section.

Deﬁnition 8.30. Let B ∈ B. The Brauer tree dg algebra AQB is deﬁned as kQB/IB with zero
diﬀerential and grading given by that of QB, where the admissible ideal IB is generated by the
following relations.
(1) For any minimal cycle

X1

α1−→ X2 −→ · · · −→ Xm−1

αm−1−−−−→ Xm

αm−−→ X1,

αiαi+1 · · · αmα1 · · · αi ∈ I for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m;

(2) If X is the common d-diagonal of two B-cycles

X = X1

X = Y1

α1−→ X2 −→ · · · −→ Xm−1
β1−→ Y2 −→ · · · −→ Ys−1

αm−1−−−−→ Xm

then βsα1 ∈ I and αmβ1 ∈ I and α1α2 · · · αm − β1β2 · · · βs ∈ I.

The following proposition is an easy generalization of well-known result for ungraded case.

Proposition 8.31. The dg algebra AQB is d-symmetric.

Now we are ready to state the following main result, which implies Theorem 7.1 for the case

∆ = An. Recall from Deﬁnition 1.14 the deﬁnition of (ZAn,d)C .

Theorem 8.32. Let B be a maximal d-Brauer relation on ((d + 1)n + d − 1)-gon and let C be the
(−d)-CY conﬁguration in ZAn,d corresponding to B. Then for the Brauer tree dg algebra AQB ,
the AR quiver of CM AQB is isomorphic to (ZAn,d)C .

The outline of our proof is the following. Consider the (−d)-CY conﬁguration CA given by the
simples of AQB . Then the AR quiver of CM AQB is isomorphic to (ZAn,d)CA . So we only need to
show C = CA. To show this, let BA be the maximal d-Brauer relation corresponds to CA.

C ←→ B −→ AQB

simples
−−−−→ CA ←→ BA

Then it suﬃces to prove B is isomorphic to BA up to rotation.

We ﬁrst describe the AR quiver of the stable category CMAQB .

Proposition 8.33. The AR quiver of CMAQB is ZAn,d.

To prove this proposition, we need some observations. Let Y ∈ (QB)0 be a vertex and a ∈ Z.
We construct a new graded quiver QY,a. It is isomorphic to QB as ungraded quiver. The degrees
of arrows ending at Y and starting at Y are changed as follows.

Y ′∈B,Y ′6=Y PY ′ ) be
a dg AQB -module, where PY is the indecomposable projective module corresponds to the vertex
Y . Consider the Brauer tree dg algebra AQY,a . Then one can show that AQY,a is isomorphic to
the endmorphism dg algebra End(TY,a). Immediately, we have

Lemma 8.34. The functor RH om(TY,a, ?) induces a triangle equivalence Db(AQB )/ per AQB →
Db(AQY,a )/ per AQY,a .
Proof. It is clear that TY,a is a compact generator of per AQB . Then RH om(TY,a, ?) : per AQB →
per AQY,a is an equivalence, which induces a triangle equivalence Db(AQB ) → Db(AQY,a ). Thus
(cid:3)
the assertion is true.

Now we prove Proposition 8.33 by adjusting degrees of QB to some special case.

(1) If QB is admissible. Let D be the set of arrows in QB with degree −d + 1.

Proof of Proposition 8.33. Let B ∈ B. We say QB is admissible if each minimal cycle in QB has
an arrow with degree −d + 1 and other arrows with degree 0. We consider the following two cases.
It is an
admissible cutting set in the sense of [FP, Schr]. Therefore AQB is isomorphic to the trivial
extension Λ ⊕ DΛ[d − 1] by [Schr, Theorem 1.3], where Λ is the factor algebra AQB /(D). By
Corollary 6.4, CM(AQB ) is triangle equivalent to Db(modΛ)/ν[d]. By [H1, Theorem 6.7], Λ is an
iterated titled algebra of type An. So the AR-quiver of CM(AQB ) is given by ZAn,d.

(2) For general QB. We claim there exists B′ ∈ B, such that QB′ is admissible and there is
a triangle equivalence CM(AQB )
In fact, we can start from any minimal cycle.
Under a suitable ordering, we may change the degrees of QB to obtain an admissible quiver QB′
step by step by our discussion above. Then by Theorem 2.4 (3) and by Lemma 8.34, CMAQB =
Db(AQB )/ per AQB is triangle equivalence to CMAQB′ = Db(AQB′ )/ per AQB′ . Then by (1), the
(cid:3)
AR quiver of CM(AQB ) is ZAn,d.

∼
−→ CM(AQB′ ).

Let B = {Y1, · · · , Yn} be a maximal d-Brauer relation on ((d + 1)n + d − 1)-gon. Recall that the
vertices of QB are given by {Y1, · · · , Yn}. By Theorem 5.6, the set CA := {S1, · · · , Sn} of simple
dg AQB -modules is a (−d)-CY conﬁguration, where Si is the simple module corresponds to vertex
Yi. And by Proposition 8.33, the AR quiver of CMAQB is ZAn,d. Thus we can also regard CA as
the subset of ZAn,d. Let BA be the maximal d-Brauer relation corresponds to CA. By abuse of
notation, the d-diagonals in BA are also denoted by {S1, · · · , Sn}.

Let {Yj1, Yj2 , · · · , Yjs} be a B-cycle with anti-clockwise ordering. Then it gives a minimal cycle

in QB.

Yj1

α1−→ Yj2

α2−→ · · ·

αs−1−−−→ Yjs

αs−→ Yj1

where deg αi = 1 − δ(Yji , Yji+1 ) by Deﬁnition 8.26. The following proposition gives us some
information which determines B uniquely.

Proposition 8.35. Assume αi : Yji → Yji+1 is an arrow in QB. Then δ(Sji , Sji+1) = δ(Yji , Yji+1 ),
where we regard Sji and Yji as d-diagonals in BA and B respectively.
Proof. By Remark 8.13, δ(Sji , Sji+1 ) = min{t > 0 | ¯hSji
we have ¯hSji
(Sji , Sji+1 [t]). Thus

(Sji+1 [t]) 6= 0} and by Proposition 5.13,

(Sji+1 [t]) = HomCMAQB

δ(Sji , Sji+1 ) = min{t > 0 | HomCMAQB

(Sji , Sji+1 [t]) 6= 0}
= min{t > 0 | HomDb(AQB )(Sji , Sji+1 [t]) 6= 0}

where the second equality holds by the fact that HomDb(AQB )(Sji , A) = H−d+1(Sji ) = 0. Let
l = − deg αi. By our construction of QB, it is clear that every path from Yji to Yji+1 has degree no
more than −l. Then HomDb(AQB )(Sji , Sji+1 [t]) = 0 for any 0 ≤ t ≤ l and HomDb(AQB )(Sji , Sji+1 [l+
(cid:3)
1]) 6= 0 by Proposition 1.7. Thus δ(Sji , Sji+1 ) = l + 1 = 1 − deg αi = δ(Yji , Yji+1 ).

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 8.32.

Proof of Theorem 8.32. Consider the map φ : B → BA sending Yj to Sj. It is clearly bijective
and for any B cycle C with anti-clockwise ordering {Yj1, Yj2 , · · · , Yjm }, we have δ(Yji , Yji+1 ) =
δ(Sji , Sji+1 ) by Proposition 8.35. Then by Proposition 8.16, B is isomorphic to BA up to rotation.
(cid:3)
Then the AR quiver of CM AQB is isomorphic to (ZAn,d)C .

Appendix A. A new proof of Theorem 8.6

In this part, we give a new proof of Theorem 8.6 by using the results developed in Section 8.1.

We ﬁrst point out the following property.

Proposition A.1. For any B ∈ B, we have #B = n.

36

HAIBO JIN

Proof. Let B ∈ B. We apply the induction on n.

If n = 1, then Π is a 2d-gon and every d-diagonal has the form (i, i + d). In this case, any two

d-diagonals intersect, which implies that B contains only one d-diagonal.

Assume our argument is true for n ≤ m, where m ≥ 1. Now consider the case n = m + 1.
Assume I ∈ B has the form (i1, i1 + d + (d + 1)j). Then Π\I has two connect components Π1
and Π2, where Π1 is a ((d + 1)j + d − 1)-gon and Π2 is a ((d + 1)(n − j − 1) + d − 1)-gon. By
Lemma 8.12, B ∩ Π1 (resp. B ∩ Π2) is a maximal d-Brauer relation of Π1 (resp. Π2). By induction,
#(B ∩ Π1) = j and #(B ∩ Π2) = n − j − 1. Then #B = #(B ∩ Π1) + #(B ∩ Π2) + 1 = n. Therefore
(cid:3)
the statement holds for any n ≥ 1.

The following lemma is immediately from our labelling on ZAn.

Lemma A.2. Let X, Y ∈ Z(An)0, where X = (x, x + d + (d + 1)m), 0 ≤ m ≤ n − 1. Then
hX (Y ) 6= 0 if and only if Y = (x + (d + 1)i, x + d + (d + 1)j), where 0 ≤ i ≤ m ≤ j ≤ n − 1.

The following lemma gives us a way to read ¯hX (Y ) from the relative position of X and Y in Π.

Lemma A.3. Let X, Y ∈ ZAn,d. We also regard them as d-diagonals in Π. Then
(1) If X and Y are disjoint, then ¯hX (Y ) = 0;
(2) If X and Y are joint, then ¯hX(Y ) 6= 0 if and only if X and Y are connected by d-diagonals as

follows

Y

x1

y1

X

x2

that is, if and only if (y1, x2) (or equivalently, (y2, x1)) is a d-diagonal.

Then by the description above, we have the following result.

Proposition A.4. Let X, Y ∈ ZAn,d. Then the following are equivalent
(1) ¯hX (Y [−s]) = 0 and ¯hY (X[−s]) = 0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1;
(2) X and Y are disjoint as d-diagonals.

Proof. From (1) to (2). If X ∩ Y 6= ∅. We may assume X = (x1, x2 = x1 + d + (d + 1)i) and
x1 ≤ y1 < x2 ≤ y2, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. We consider the following cases.
• If x2 ≤ y2 ≤ x2 + d − 1 and y1 − x1 > y2 − x2, then ¯hX (Y [x2 − y2]) 6= 0;
• If x2 ≤ y2 ≤ x2 + d − 1 and y1 − x1 ≤ y2 − x2, then ¯hX (Y [x1 − y1]) 6= 0;
• If x2 + d < y2 and y1 = x1 + d + (d + 1)i′, 0 ≤ i′ ≤ i, then (x1, y1) is a d-diagonal. Then by our

discussion above, ¯hY (X) 6= 0;

• If x2 + d − 1 < y2 and y1 6= x1 + d + (d + 1)i′ for any 0 ≤ i′ ≤ i. Then there exist 0 ≤ t ≤ d, such
that Y [−t] has the form (x1 + (d + 1)j, y2 − t) for some 0 ≤ j < i. In this case, ¯hX (Y [−t]) 6= 0.

All the cases above are contradictory to the condition (1). So we know X and Y are disjoint.

From (2) to (1). Assume X and Y are disjoint as follows

y2

x1

X

y1

Y

x2

For 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1, Y [−s] = (y1 − s, y2 − s). If X ∩ Y [−s] = ∅, it is clear ¯hX (Y [−s]) = 0. If
X ∩ Y [−s] 6= ∅, i.e. y2 − s ≤ x2. Then (y2 − s, x2) can not be a d-diagonal (it is possible only when
s > d). So we still have ¯hX (Y [−s]) = 0. Similarly, ¯hY X[−s] = 0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1.
(cid:3)

CM DG MODULES AND NEGATIVE CY CONFIGURATIONS

Remark A.5. Let X = (x1, x2) and Y = (y1, y2) be two d-diagonals. Assume x1 < y1 < x2 < y2.
Then by the proof of Proposition A.4, if y1 6= x1 + d + (d + 1)i′ for any 0 ≤ i′ ≤ i, in other words,
if (x1, y1) is not a d-diagonal, then there exists 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1 such that ¯hX (Y [−s]) 6= 0.

To prove Theorem 8.6, we need another lemma.

Lemma A.6. Let B ∈ B and let M be a d-diagonal. Then there exists X ∈ B and 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1
such that ¯hX(M [−i]) 6= 0.

Proof. Since B is maximal, there exists X ∈ B such that X ∩ M 6= ∅. Up to rotation, there are
three types of positional relationships between M and X as follows.

X

x1 = m2

x2 = m2

type 1

m1

x1

M

X

type 2

type 3

We show the statement case by case. For type 1, it is clear ¯hX (M ) 6= 0 by Lemma A.3. For
type 2, if there is m1 < t < x1, such that T = (m1, t) is a d-diagonal in B, then ¯hT (M ) 6= 0. If
there is no such a T , we claim that ∃ Y ∈ B such that Y and M are of type 3.

To prove this claim, let us consider the B-cycle BX containing X such that BX and M are on
the same side of X. If the claim is not true, then for any X ′ ∈ BX , M and X ′ are disjoint or
of type 2 (Notice that by our assumption, type 1 never happens). Labelling BX anti-clockwise
starting from X. Let Xs+1 = X = X1 (see ﬁgure (a) below). We may write x1 = x2 + d + (d + 1)i′
and m1 = m2 + d + (d + 1)i′′, where 0 ≤ i′′ < i′ ≤ n − 1, then x1 − m1 = (d + 1)(i′ − i′′) and the
number of vertices between m1 and x1 is (d + 1)(i′ − i′′) − 1 = d + (d + 1)(i′ − i′′ − 1). Let j be the
smallest number such that Xj and X1 are on the diﬀerent sides of M . Then the sum of number of
s
i=1 δ(Xi, Xi+1) ≥ d + s. It is
vertices between Xi and Xi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ j − 1 is at least d. Then
s
contradictory to Proposition 8.15, which says
i=1 δ(Xi, Xi+1) = d + s − 1. So the claim holds.
Then we only need to consider type 3.

Assume X and M are of type 3. We may assume there is no X ′ ∈ B, such that X ′ and the
vertex m1 are on the same side of X, and X ′, M are of type 3 (if such X ′ exists, replace X by X ′).
Now we show (x2, m1) is not a d-diagonal. If (x2, m1) is a d-diagonal, consider the B-cycle BX
containing X, BX and the vertex m1 are on the same side of X. Labelling BX anti-clockwise (see
ﬁgure (b) above). Since (x2, m1) is a d-diagonal, then (d + 1)|(x1 − m1). Similar to our discussion
s
i=1 δ(Xi, Xi+1) ≥ d + s, which is contradictory to Proposition 8.15. So we
for type 2, we have
know (x2, m1) is not a d-diagonal. Then by Remark A.5, there exists 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 such that
¯hX (M [−i]) 6= 0. Therefore the assertion is true.
(cid:3)

P

We are ready to prove Theorem 8.6 now.

The proof of Theorem 8.6. Given a (−d)-CY conﬁguration C in ZAn,d. By Deﬁnition 5.10, for any
two diﬀerent objects X and Y in C, we have ¯hX (Y [−s]) = 0 and ¯hY (X[−s]) = 0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1.
Then by Proposition A.4, X and Y are disjoint. So the set {X|X ∈ C} gives rise to a d-Brauer
relation B. We claim B is maximal. If not, there exists a d-diagonal M such that for any X ∈ C, X
and M are disjoint. Then by Proposition A.4, ¯hX (M [−s]) = 0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ d−1. It is contradictory
to that C is a (−d)-CY conﬁguration (see Deﬁnition 5.10).

On the other hand, given a maximal d-Brauer relation B. Let C be the set of vertices of ZAn,d
corresponds to the d-diagonals in B. By Proposition A.4, for any two diﬀerent objects X and Y
in C, we have ¯hX(Y [−j]) = 0, where 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1. Let M be any vertex in ZAn,d. Since B is
maximal, then by Lemma A.6, there exists X ∈ C and 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1 such that ¯hX (M [−i]) 6= 0. So
(cid:3)
C is a (−d)-CY conﬁguration.
