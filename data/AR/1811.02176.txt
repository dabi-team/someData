Abstract 

The effect of isothermal pre-oxidation treatments on the β-(Ni,Pt)Al + René N5 system degradation 

is  here  reported.  The  oxidation  treatments  were  carried  out  from  900  (mostly  θ-Al2O3  growing 

conditions) to 1200°C (mainly α-Al2O3 growing conditions) for 5 h, under a purified Ar-stream 

with  an  fixed  pO2=  1  x  10-5  atm.  Results  are  discussed  based  on  the  correlation  between  the 

structural,  microstructural  and  chemical  properties  of  the  β-(Ni,Pt)Al  BC  showing  that  pre-

oxidation parameters have an important effect on the multi-elemental counter diffusion phenomena 

along BC. For instance, a significant BC+IDZ thickness increase of 55% at 1200 °C was observed 

with respect to as-received sample just after 5 h of oxidation resulting in a severe BC degradation.

1.  Introduction  

Thermal  Barrier  Coating  (TBC)  systems  have  been  used  for  decades  to  protect  hot-section 

components  of  gas  turbines  [1,2].  TBC  systems  are  multi-layered  coatings  deposited  on  a 

superalloys (SA) substrate and contain: a) an alumina-forming metallic alloy bond coat (BC), e.g., 

NiPtAl or NiCoCrAlY, b) a thermal growth oxide (TGO) as result of BC oxidation, and c) a ceramic 

top coat (TC) as a thermal insulator, typically 7 wt.% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2, known as 7YSZ. The 

lifetime of TBC systems are mainly limited by intrinsic mechanisms associated with the interplay 

between BC/TGO/TC and their interfaces [3]. Failure of TBC systems is usually manifested as TC 

spallation. Because of this, efforts have been made to improve the lifetime of TBC systems using 

various  strategies,  including  pre-oxidation  treatments  prior  7YSZ-TC  deposition  in  order  to 

improve the TGO properties [4–7].  

Pre-oxidation can be defined as a heat treatment of the BC + SA system controlling the oxygen 

partial pressure (pO2), temperature and time to promote and control the growth of a continuous and 

stable  aluminum  oxide  scale  (i.e.  θ-Al2O3,  -Al2O3)  prior  TC  deposition  [8–10]  .  In  previous 

experiments  done  in  our  group,  the  polymorphic  evolution  of  the  Al2O3  upon  temperature  was 

analyzed. The formation of θ-Al2O3 phase takes place at 900°C and starts to transform into the -

Al2O3 phase at slightly higher temperature (ca. 950°C), reaching a full transformation into -Al2O3 

after ~ 4 h oxidation at 1150°C in Argon (i.e., pO2= 1x 10-5 atm) atmosphere [8]. A separate study 

showed that low-pO2 sluggish the -Al2O3 growth (p-type oxide) according with the relation kpθ ∝ 

3
16⁄
O2

p

 [10]. 

Furthermore, it has been reported that a good quality -Al2O3 scale with controlled grain size and 

homogeneity  will  lead  to  an  improvement  adhesion  of  the  BC/TGO/TC  interfaces  [5,9,10]. 

However,  there  is  a  lack  of  information  about  how  pre-oxidation  can  affect  the  physical  and 

chemical properties of the BC+SA system because of the elemental diffusion along the layers during 

pre-oxidation treatments. This information is essential to select the proper pre-oxidation parameters 

to avoid premature or induced a BC degradation during this treatment. For instance, Al is thermally 

activated during pre-oxidation and diffuses either, to the surface (outward diffusion), leading to the 

formation  of  an  alumina  scale,  or  inward-diffusion  to  the  SA.  Additionally,  due  to  the  existing 

chemical gradients of several elements between the β-(Ni,Pt)Al BC and the René N5 SA, diffusion 

of Pt takes place from the BC to the SA (inward-diffusion) and heavy elements (e.g., Co, Cr, Ta, 

W, Mo) diffuse from the SA to the BC [11]. Based on this, the objective of this work is to investigate 

the effect of isothermal pre-oxidation treatments on the physical and chemical properties of the β-

(Ni,Pt)Al+René N5 system. Specifically, the correlation with the structural, microstructural, and 

chemical properties after thermal exposures.  

Material and methods 

Rectangular samples (1.8 x 1.2 x 0.15 cm) were provided by GE Aircraft Engines (Evendale, OH). 

The β-(Ni,Pt)Al BC was deposited by the Johnson-Matthey method on a grit-blasted single-crystal 

René N5 SA. This geometry was required for the in-situ oxidation kinetics study, which has been 

reported elsewhere  [8,10]. In the present  contribution, oxidations  exposures were carried out  to 

investigate the β-(Ni,Pt)Al+René N5 system degradation in the range of 900 to 1200°C (with 50°C 

increments) for 5 hours, under purified argon stream (working gas) with a pO2 = 1 x 10-5 atm, and 

with a total working pressure of 1 atm. To control the desired oxygen concentration, the argon was 

passed  through  a  gas  purification  system  (OG-120M,  Oxygon  Industries,  USA).  After  pre-

oxidation  treatments,  the  samples  were  subsequently  cross-sectioned  and  carefully  polished. 

Preparation  started  with  abrasive  wet  cutting  using  a  low-speed,  diamond-wafer  blade  on  an 

automatic  cut-off  machine.  Samples  were  mounted  in  pairs,  using  a  low-viscosity  cold-setting 

epoxy, with the oxidized surfaces facing each other to avoid edge rounding. The mounted samples 

were grounded using a series of water-cooled silicon carbide abrasive papers down to a 4000-grit 

finish  (i.e.,  according  with  the  Federation  of  the  European  Producers  of  Abrasives  which  is 

equivalent to the 1200 standard ANSI grit). 

To reveal the microstructure, the samples were mechano-chemically polished with a commercial 

colloidal silica suspension (MasterMet2, Buehler, USA) followed by chemical etching using a 5 

vol.%  HF  aqueous  solution.  Finally,  the  samples  were  ultrasonically  cleaned  in  methanol  and 

deionized water for 20 min and dried with nitrogen gas. 

The chemical analysis was conducted in the cross section of the samples using a FEG-SEM (Quanta 

3D 200i FEI, NL) equipped with an EDX-spectrometer (INCA 350 EDS, Oxford Instruments, UK) 

and EPMA (JXA-8900R WD/ED Microanalyzer, JEOL, Japan) with the purpose of correlating the 

local chemical composition with the phase transformations of the β-(Ni,Pt)Al BC as a function of 

the  thermal  treatments.  These  were  also  followed  by  X-ray  diffraction  analysis  using  a  Rigaku 

Dmax/2100 vertical diffractometer with a Cu-kα radiation, XRD details. 

2.  Results and discussion 

The microstructure of the β-(Ni,Pt)Al + René N5 system pre-oxidized at 1050 and 1200oC for 5 h 

is shown in Figure 1. An image of the cross section of the sample in the as-received condition is 

also  shown  as  a  reference  to  compare  with  the  effects  promoted  by  the  heat  treatments  at  the 

intermediate  and  highest  temperature  during  the  pre-oxidation  experiments.  Owing  to  the 

interdiffusion  processes  at  the  TGO/BC  and  BC/SA  interfaces,  a  clear  increase  of  the  BC+IDZ 

thickness is observed with temperature. This increase is about 15 % for the sample treated at 1050 

oC (Fig. 1b), and about 55% for the sample treated at 1200oC (Fig. 1c) with respect to the thickness 

of the as-received sample (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, after 5 h of exposure at 1200°C, the γ´-phase is 

observed at the BC  grain boundaries (Fig. 1c) as an evidence of the  BC Al-depletion.  It is  also 

noticed, the coarsening and growing of the IDZ precipitates as a result of the BC+IDZ growth and 

the low solubility of refractory metals in the β phase [12,13]. 

The presence of γ´ phase was confirmed by XRD analysis and it is discussed below. No significant 

changes were observed in the BC+IDZ thickness for samples oxidized below 1050 oC.

Changes  in  chemical  composition  along  the  cross  section  of  the  β-(Ni,Pt)Al  +IDZ+  René  N5 

system are shown in the Figure 2 for the samples oxidized at 900 and 1200oC, and compared with 

the sample in the as-received condition. These temperatures were selected  as known conditions 

where the TGO grow kinetics is mainly controlled by the θ-Al2O3  and α-Al2O3 phases, respectively 

[8, 10].

received condition, and after pre-oxidation treatment for 5h in pO2 = 1 x 10-5 atm at (b) 900oC and (c) 1200oC. 

In the as-received sample (Fig. 2a), it is observed that the elements Al, Ni, Pt, Cr and Co varied 

almost linearly along the first 40 m in the BC owing to the manufacturing process. The Al and Pt 

content  gradually  decreased  from  51.5  to  38.9  at.  %  and  8.9  to  3.7  at.  %,  respectively.  On  the 

contrary, the Ni, Cr and Co percentages increase from 37.5 to 45.1, 0.2 to 5.0, and 1.7 to 5.8 at. %, 

respectively. The IDZ shows heterogeneous concentrations of each element and in the SA region 

no changes in the chemical composition were observed. For the as-received and tested conditions, 

the percentage values of the refractory elements such as Re, Ta, W y Mo remain close to 0 at% 

(i.e., right-hand side scale). 

According to the analysis, chemical composition gradients are observed from the BC surface to the 

IDZ boundary. These gradients are result of the coating deposition process, which starts with a Pt-

electroplating on a grit-blasted SA substrate, followed by a heat treatment step to promote the Pt 

diffusion [8]. Later, a low-activity aluminum coating is deposited by chemical-vapor deposition 

(CVD) technique to finish the BC [14].

During the low-activity  process,  Ni diffuses outward from the SA  and reacts with  the  Al  vapor 

species present in the chamber atmosphere resulting in the formation of the β-(Ni,Pt)Al BC [15]. 

This process also allows the outward diffusion of small amounts of Co and Cr from the SA. 

Figure 2b shows the changes in β-(Ni,Pt)Al BC chemical composition after 5 h oxidation at 900oC. 

Along  the  first  25  µm,  the  gradient  composition  of  Al  is  about  zero,  with  an  Al-content  of 

approximately 45 at. %. Moreover, a continuous Pt-enrichment is observed as a result of the Ni 

inward diffusion caused by the TGO formation, reaching a maximum Pt content of about 16 at. % 

at about 8 µm. 

For the sample pre-oxidized at 1200°C (Fig. 2c), clear diferences within the BC zone are observed 

in comparison with the as-received and 900 oC conditions. The concentration of Al and Pt decrease, 

while the Ni, Cr and Co increase and reach a constant chemical composition along the BC. This 

specimen shows the lowest Al and Pt contents and the highest for Ni, while the gradients of Cr and 

Co show minimal variations. 

According  to  the  microstructural  and  chemical  composition  results,  the  chemical  gradients  are 

clearly and highly dependent on the temperature of the pre-oxidation treatment. As the temperature 

increases, greater are the changes occurring in the system (Figs. 1 and 2). Based on the chemical 

analysis, a higher Al-depletion percentage was observed for the BC pre-oxidized at 1200oC than 

for  the  sample  oxidized  at  900oC.  Previous  studies  concerning  the  oxidation  of  β-(Ni,Pt)Al  BC 

systems have found that at 1200oC is -Al2O3, the phase controlling the TGO oxidation kinetics 

[10]; It is important to mention that an accelerated Al-depletion at high temperatures is undesirable 

because this can lead to a premature failure or degradation of the system. 

Given  that  diffusion  is  a  thermally  activated  process,  during  the  pre-oxidation  treatments  two 

diffusion mechanisms occur. Aluminum within the -(Ni,Pt)Al phase outward diffuses from the 

BC surface to form the TGO, while Al and Pt inward diffuse to the superalloy as a result of the 

chemical potential gradients that promote the BC and IDZ growth. 

The inward diffusion is strengthened due to the TGO formation which acts as a diffusion barrier 

against the elemental species in the system, including the Al. It is important to notice that, even 

when pre-oxidation treatments promote TGO growth, if the exposure treatments are not suitable 

conditions, they will also generate a BC degradation as a consequence of the loss Al and Pt content 

which reduces the BC lifetime (see Fig. 2b-c), this is agreement with the reported by Chen et al. 

[13]. 

The  BC  degradation  is  mainly  affected  by  counter-diffusion  between  BC  and  SA  [16-17].  An 

evidence of this is clearly observed in Fig. 2b. The stabilization of the Al content during the first 

25 m of the BC shows that Al2O3 scale acts as a diffusion barrier at the TGO/BC interface and the 

next 15 m the elemental gradient in BC shows the inward diffusion of Al until the IDZ/SA. This 

is, the Al depletion in the BC is mainly promoted by interdiffusion, and not by TGO growth. 

A  systematic  study  to  investigate  the  effect  of  the  oxidation  temperature  on  the  elemental 

composition  within  the  BC  is  depicted  in  Fig.  3.  A  significant  variation  in  the  compositional 

gradients for the samples oxidized from 900 to 1050 °C were observed while at 1100 and 1200 °C 

a  compositional  steady-state  is  reached  after  5  h.  For  the  sample  treated  at  900°C,  is  notable  a 

significant compositional change at the first 16 µm which is owing to the decrease of the Al and 

Ni content and its consequent Pt enrichment in comparison with as-received condition (Fig. 3a-c). 

The  Al2O3  scale  formation  causes  the  Ni  inward  diffusion  to  compensate  Al  depletion  which 

promotes an unbalance in the diffusivity of both elements, forming voids at metal-oxide interface 

[8,18,19], as can be clearly observed in Figure 4. 

In this regard, it is well known that Pt retards the formation of mature voids injected due to the 

accumulation of Kirkendall vacancies and it occupies preferentially Ni sites in -(Ni,Pt)Al alloy in 

comparison with non-Pt-containing alloys, e.g., -NiAl [18,20,21]. 

Figure 3. Variation in the chemical composition of the bond coat along the cross section at the different temperatures 
tested. 

The decrease in Al content is  also related with increased mobility caused by the presence of Pt 

which decreases the Al activation energy promoting the faster formation of an Al2O3 scale on the 

BC surface [20,22].

Figure 4. Voids observed at the BC/TGO interface after pre-oxidation treatment at 900oC for 5 hours. 

Figs. 3b and 3d-e show how the Ni, Cr, and Co diffuse outward from the SA and hence, the gradient 

is positive regarding the distance. Since diffusion is a thermally activated process, the Ni, Cr and 

Co content are higher in the BC as the exposure temperature increases. For instance, at 900 °C the 

Ni, Cr and Co reaches 38.1, 1.0 and 2.1 at.  % while at 1200 °C  attains 53.7, 5.6 and 5.3 at. % 

respectively, at the TGO/BC interface. 

The  BC  shows  some  interesting  relationships.  Ni  and  Al  behave  inversely  as  the  pre-oxidation 

temperature increases. Also, it can be observed that the Ni changes in an inverse relationship with 

Pt, in a similar way than the Al behave with Cr. This behavior is explained in terms of the two-

sublattice  model  of  the  ordered  NiAl  proposed  by  Ansara  et.  al.,  in  which  the    phase  is 

described by the δ and λ sublattices that correspond to the (0,0,0) and (½, ½, ½) wyckoff positions, 

respectively [23]. In the stoichiometric phase, Ni occupies the δ sublattice and Al occupies the λ 

sublattice positions. Deviations from stoichiometry are addressed by triple point defects to maintain 

the  crystal structure. Vacancies in the Al-rich side are created and Ni anti-sites appear in the Ni-

rich side [24,25]. The elemental behavior  in  the  coating can be understood considering the site 

preferences proposed by Jiang et. al., Pt and Co have a strong preference for Ni sites in the  phase 

Interfacial voidsFIB preparation damageTGO2 μm 
while the Cr site preference is dependent of the composition and temperature [26–28]. In the case 

of pre-oxidation experiments at high temperatures with subsequent Ni enrichment of the coating, 

Cr has a defined preference for Al sites in the  sublattice [29]. The Fig. 3f shows the composition 

ratio of δ and λ sublattices considering the Pt, Co and Cr site preferences, respectively. It can be 

seen how the composition of the pseudo-binary (Ni+Pt+Co)(Al+Cr) moves from 1 to 1.9 approx., 

which is related to the change from the 50 to the 66 Ni fraction “XNi= δ (δ+⁄

λ)” during the pre-

oxidation experiments. 

Based on this and considering a two-sublattice model, is possible to comprehend how the coating 

chemical composition shifts from stoichiometry to the boundary with  + γ’ (L12) mixture region 

as  a  function  of  the  thermal  exposures.  Figure  5  shows  the  BC  chemical  composition  along 

thickness  considering  that  Co  atoms  occupy  the  Ni  sublattice  whereas  Cr  atoms  occupy  the  Al 

sublattice plotted in the isothermal section of the ternary Ni-Al-Pt phase diagram at 1100/1150 °C 

reported  by  Gleeson  et.  al.  [30].  From  right  to  left,  the  data  represents  the  composition  in  the 

vicinity of the TGO/BC interface and along the BC until it reaches the BC/IDZ interface. 

Despite this diagram is plotted at a specific temperature, it aims to show the correlation between 

the chemical composition and the phase transformations of the BC as a function of the temperature. 

Plotting the chemical compositions in this diagram at the different pre-oxidation temperatures, is 

an approach that allow observing the diffusion path and comparing to the structural evolution in 

the specimens. The as-received specimen composition (blue curve in Fig. 5) and those subjected to 

a heat treatment from 900 to 1000°C are located specifically in the β-NiAl (cubic structure) zone, 

irrespective of the variations in the chemical composition. As observed in the ternary diagram, the 

composition  values  of  the  sample  treated  at  1050°C  are  localized  at  the  boundaries  where  the 

transformation from bbc -phase to the tetragonal martensite L10-phase is expected to occur.

along the cross section pre-oxidized at different temperatures. Reprinted from [30]. 

The -phase and the martensitic region diminishes as the temperature also decreases as indicated 

by the dotted line in the phase diagram for a temperature of 1100oC. The compositions values of 

the sample treated  at  1100°C  are located inside  the martensitic transformation  region  while the 

composition for the specimens treated at 1150 °C and 1200 °C are placed in  + γ’ phases mixture 

zone, without reaching the γ’ phase in the ternary system. This result agrees with that observed in 

Fig. 1, where the γ’ phase was identified in the 1200 oC heat-treated specimen. Moreover, XNi for 

the  pseudo-binary  (Ni+Pt+Co)(Al+Cr)  system  obtained  by  mean  of  sublattice  composition 

normalization can be correlated to the observed diffusion path in Fig. 5. XNi =50 corresponds to 

the ordered  phase of the as-received sample, while XNi = 66 represents the Ni-enriched region 

where γ’ is suitable to precipitate.

exhibits  the  characteristic  superlattice  (100),  (111),  (210)  and  fundamental  (110),  (200),  (211) 

peaks. The fundamental peaks demonstrate the body centered cubic character of the BC and the 

superlattice peaks its  ordered nature. As the exposure temperature increases  up to  1100 °C, the 

β(100)  and  β(110)  peaks  shift  to  lower  angles  and  the  intensity  of  the  superlattice  (100)  peak 

decreases. The shifting of the peaks corresponds to the increase in lattice constant of the β phase 

and may be associated to the change of Pt from 9 to 15 % at during the first 10 µm in the BC. This 

assumption considers that Pt has a remarkable site preference for the δ sublattice [28] and its atomic 

size is higher than the Ni atomic size (1.39 Å  compared to 1.24 Å ), then Pt replaces the Ni and 

contributes to the size of the β phase. The decrease of the intensity of the superlattice peaks shows 

the partial disordering of the β phase in the range of 950 °C to 1100 °C, and complete disorder 

from  1100  °C  forward.  It  is  observed  that  the  β  phase  is  disordered  and  transformed  to  the

martensite  phase  after  1100  °C.  The  martensite  phase  is  identified  by  the  presence  of  the 

superlattice  (110)  and fundamental  (111) and  (200) peaks.  This  diffusion-less transformation is 

related to the Al depletion in the coating and it has been reported before for binary NiAl [16] and 

commercial β-(Ni,Pt)Al BC  [12,31]. Smialek et al. [16] reported that the cubic β phase destabilizes 

and  transforms  to  the  tetragonal  L10  phase  for  values  below  37  at.  %  of  Al.  The  onset  of  the 

martensitic transformation found in this work for 5 h exposure is between 1100 and 1150 °C with 

values of Al in the range of 33 to 36 at. %. These results are consistent with previously published 

data [31]. 

The XRD patterns deconvolution of the sample exposed to 1200 °C shown in the Figure 6b revealed 

the presence of the disordered β, L10 and gamma prime L12 phases. The L12 phase is recognized 

by the appearance of the superlattice (110) and fundamental (200), (202) peaks and it is the result 

of the diffusional transformation as the Al depletes. The XRD patterns allowed also to corroborate 

the diffusion path observed in the Fig. 5 when the normalization of the composition to the ternary 

Ni-Al-Pt system is considered. As can be seen in Figs. 5 and 6, the β phase is stable in the as-

received (ordered β) and in the heat-treated sample exposed up to 1100  C (partial disordered β). 

A mixture region of L10 + β can be found from 1100  C to 1150  C and a two-phase zone of L12 

+ disordered β is  reached  at  temperatures above  1150 °C.  These results  are  consistent  with  the 

microstructural  observations  and  chemical  compositions  presented  in  Fig.  1c  and  Fig.  3, 

respectively. The phase transformations β → β + L10 and β → β + L12 that take place during the 

thermal  exposures  which  imply  that  the  pre-oxidation  experiments  carried  out  for  5  h  caused  a 

significant degradation of the BC.  At this point, a critical balance among time, temperature, and 

oxide scales formation (θ- and/or -Al2O3) must be considered during the pre-oxidation treatments 

of the TBC systems. 

 
Conclusions 

Pre-oxidation treatments were carried out in the β- (Ni, Pt) Al +IDZ+ René N5 system in order 

to investigate the effect of temperature on the structural, microstructural and chemical stability 

of the system. Multi-elemental counter diffusion phenomena were observed due to chemical 

potential along the β- (Ni, Pt) Al +IDZ+ René N5 system, where the most significant findings 

are described below: 

  A significant BC+IDZ thickness increase from 15% to 55% in the range of 1050 °C to 1200 

°C were observed with respect to as-received sample, as a result mainly of the elemental 

counter diffusion between BC and SA. 

  The  pre-oxidation  treatments  at  temperatures  below  of  1050°C  shown  an  unbalance 

diffusivity due to TGO-Al2O3 scale formation which promotes the Al depletion of the BC 

and the Ni inward diffusion causing a Pt-enrichment in the BC. For instance, a 16 at. % at 

about 8 µm for the sample pre-oxidized at 900°C with excessive interfacial voids formation 

at the TGO/BC interface as a result of the Kirkendall effect. 

  The elemental flux is initially accelerated by the effect of temperature and subsequently 

attenuated  by  the  growth  of  the  TGO,  which  forms  a  diffusion  barrier  at  the  interface 

BC/TGO. 

  The  two-sublattice  model  adequately  describes  the  elemental  distribution  within  the 

crystalline phases and its phase evolution considering the study system. For instance, the 

BC phase transformation from to +γ’ after 1100oC according with XRD. 

Based on this findings, a final conclusion can be made. Despite pre-oxidation treatments have been 

proved  to  be  beneficial  for  increasing  the  TBC  systems  lifetime  due  to  the  exclusive  a-Al2O3 

formation []; the pre-oxidation parameters (e.g., pO2, temperature and time among others) must be 

selected  in  such  a  way,  that  the  pre-oxidation  conditions  promote  the  a-phase  growth  without 

compromising the BC integrity that may reduce the TBC system service performance.
