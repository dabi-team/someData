Abstract 
In this paper we report the experimental implementation of a theoretically-proposed technique for creating a 
photoionized plasma in the laboratory using X-ray line radiation. Using a Sn laser-plasma to irradiate an Ar 
gas target, the photoionization parameter , ξ = 4πF/Ne, reached values of order 50 erg cm s-1 , where F is the 
radiation flux in erg cm-2s-1. The significance of this is that this technique allows us to mimic effective spectral 
radiation temperatures in excess of 1keV. We show that our plasma starts to be collisionally dominated before 
the peak of the X-ray drive. However, the technique is extendable to higher energy laser systems to create 
plasmas with parameters relevant to benchmarking codes used to model astrophysical objects. 

I. Introduction 
Photoionized plasmas are thought to be regularly associated with accretion-powered astrophysical objects [1-
6], where the radiation field is sufficiently intense that photoexcitation and ionization rates are high relative 
to electron collisional excitation and ionization rates. The distribution of ionization is characterised by the 
photoionization parameter ξ  which may reach ≃ 1000  erg cm s-1 or greater [e.g. 7]. There have been several 
attempts  to  create  such  photoionized  plasmas  in  the  laboratory,  to  allow  plasma  modelling  codes  to  be 
benchmarked against well-diagnosed experimental data. However, as the electron density is generally much 
larger than the astrophysical counterpart, so too must be the X-ray flux to generate high values of ξ. This can 
be difficult, even on major facilities. Foord et al. [8] created a photoionized plasma using X-rays from the Z 
Machine pinch at the Sandia National Laboratories, the X-ray flux acting both to heat and decompress the 
original foil, and to subsequently bathe the resulting plasma in a radiation field to achieve values of ξ ≃ 25 
erg cm s-1. More recently, Fujioka et al. [9] generated a photoionized plasma with the high-power GEKKO-
XII laser facility with ξ ≃	6 erg cm s-1 and an effective radiation temperature of ~0.5 keV albeit for < 200 ps. 
Loisel et al. [10] recently achieved ξ ≃	20 erg cm s-1 on the Z Machine pinch.

We have used an experimental technique based on a proposal by Hill and Rose [11] that replaces the 
usual broad-band, quasi-black-body source with an intense line radiation source. As well as providing a high 
X-ray flux,  this allows keV radiation to dominate over the softer X-rays and thus mimics the effect of a higher 
spectral temperature on the photoionization of the target gas, where in the limit inner-shell photoionization 
should dominate over outer-shell photoionization. This is an advantage if we are to use such experiments to 
benchmark codes under relevant conditions.  

II. Experimental set-up 
Our experiment was carried out on the VULCAN laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The target, 
illustrated in Fig. 1, was an Ar-filled gas cell, made from Al, with a window on each face. The ’east’ window 
consisted of a 18.8 μm polypropylene (CH) foil coated on the outside with 218 nm of Sn for full shots  This 
window was fitted to a circular re-entrant plug that allowed the window to be further inside the gas cell. A 
500 µm diameter hole in the 500 µm thick base of the plug also served to partially collimate the X-ray flux 
onto the gas fill. The ‘south’ face was covered with a 20 µm Kapton window that allowed the emission of 
fluorescent X-rays (Ar K-α and K-β at ≃ 3 keV) from the heated gas to be imaged by a spherical Mica crystal 
with  spatial  imaging  in  the  direction  normal  to  the  focal  spot  of  the  heating  beams.  The  ’west’  window, 
opposite the heating beams and viewing into the recessed aperture, was also 20 µm of Kapton and allowed 
the L-shell drive radiation to be monitored by a Si(111) spectrometer [12] and X-ray streak camera. A pinhole 
camera fitted with a 10 μm pinhole, with a magnification of 2.56±0.03, monitored the source size in the keV 
region. Remaining windows were also Kapton and provided lines-of-sight for target alignment.  

FIG. 1. Inset: Schematic of the gas cell. Main: Experimental schematic showing the drive laser beams incident upon a 
thin layer of Sn coated on top of CH. The X-ray target was placed over a 0.5 mm opening made in a re-entrant plug 
which fitted inside the ‘East’ Window of the gas cell. This allowed observation of the K-shell florescence close to the 
X-ray source by a spherically curved Mica crystal spectrometer through a Kapton window mounted on the south side 
of the gas cell. The dispersion plane was vertical, allowing us to spectrally resolve and to spatially resolve X-ray 
emission along a direction normal to the laser focal plane. Two flat silicon crystal X-ray spectrometers were used to 
spectrally characterise the X-ray target, with one viewing the laser irradiated side of the target and the other through the 
target and a second Kapton window. In addition, through this window a streak camera coupled to a flat HOPG crystal 
measured the temporal profile.

A hypodermic needle inserted into the base of the gas cell acted as a fill line and mounting post. The gas cell 
was illuminated with 6 overlapping laser pulses (up to 850 J at 527 nm) in a 300–500 μm focal spot with a 
1.5 ns flat top temporal profile. This created a source of Sn L-shell line radiation in the 3.4–4.3 keV range 
which photoionized the Ar gas. In Figure 2 we plot sample spectra from the Si crystal spectrometers, with a 
wide  spectral  range  explored  by  moving  the  spectrometers  over  a  series  of  shots.  Analysis  of  the  spectra 
transmitted through the CH foil side of the target allowed us to estimate that a total of ≈ 2.0±0.5% of the laser 
energy converted to L-shell radiation on a typical shot.

The energy calibration of the spectrometer was performed using a test spectrum from a Ca target with well-known He-
like and Li-like lines. (c) Lineout combining several shots with various Bragg angles, and scaled according to laser 
energy, to assemble the whole L-band spectrum from Sn.  

The contribution of lower energy (sub-keV to keV) radiation from the Sn foil was monitored in a narrow range 
centred around 1.5 keV using a TAP crystal. Based on these measurements and earlier work with Pd foils [13] 
we have estimated the flux of radiation that will pass through the CH filtering. This is about 20±5% of the L-
shell flux and  corresponds to an effective black-body radiation temperature of 175±10eV.

Fig. 3 presents a streak image and lineout of the L-shell emission, which varied between shots from ~ 0.4–0.5 
ns full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) duration. For each shot both time-resolved and time-integrated L-
shell spectra and X-ray pinhole camera images were obtained. 

III. Results and discussion 
Fig. 4(a) shows a raw image from the Mica crystal spectrometer [14] for a shot with 500 mbar gas pressure. 
Observation of the cold K-α doublet indicated a resolution of 1.2 eV FWHM. Fig. 4(a) also shows the emission 
from the X-ray drive plasma as it expands outwards away from the gas cell, while in Fig. 4(b) we present the 
image of a shot where the Sn layer was replaced with Al, which has much lower radiative emission in the 3 
to 4 keV regime. There is virtually no K-α emission evident in this case, indicating that the production of the 
fluorescence was driven by radiative flux from the Sn plasma, and not by collisional excitation and ionization 
from plasma driven into the gas from the irradiated foil.

where the Ar is viewed and where plasma from the expanding laser-driven material  is visible as it moves away from

gas pressure (787 J laser energy) has the 218 nm Sn layer replaced with 186 nm Al, and there is a dramatic drop in the 
emission of Ar K-α and virtual disappearance of K-β emission. The calibration scale is the same for both images. (c) 
Raw spectra at varying gas pressure, taken ~0.5-0.7 mm from the X-ray drive source. For 1000 and 300 mbar there is a 
similar level of maximum ion stage observed, but as the pressure drops to 152 mbar and then 50 mbar the maximum 
ion stage also decreases. Red squares mark the expected positions of the Ar K-α1 lines from different ion stages, where 
the charge denoted refers to that of the initial ion prior to creation of the inner-shell vacancy by photoionization.

Raw spectra at varying gas pressure are presented in Fig. 4(c). The wavelength scale for this figure is set using 
the  cold K-a emission far from the source and weak drive shots along with the position of the K-a to check 
the dispersion. There is only a small change in the highest ionization stages detected when the pressure drops 
from  1000  to  150  mbar  and  the  spectra  are  similar.  However,  there  is  a  more  noticeable  drop  in  average 
ionisation on a reduction to 50 mbar. 

In Fig. 5(a) we show the spectral lineouts of despeckled images from two shots at 50 mbar, taken as close to 
the source as possible due to the geometry of the target (z = 0.5-0.7 mm). There is a shot-to-shot variation, 
which  is  worst  for  the  lowest  density  case  due  to  the  signal  level  being  proportional  to  the  gas  density.  
Nevertheless,  the  spectrum  in  both  cases  is  centred  on  emission  from  3 to  4 times  ionized  Ar.  Assuming 
background Z* = 3 and that hydrodynamic timescales are longer than the duration of the X-ray drive, we can 
use the gas pressure to estimate an electron density of 3.6 × 1018 cm-3. We justify this in the light of estimates 
of the electron temperature below, which indicate the plasma sound speed should be ~ 104 m s-1. For a typical 
dimension of  ~1 mm this implies a hydrodynamic timescale of ~ 100 ns. Fig. 5(b) shows a shot with gas 
pressure of 152 mbar, and we see that the spectrum is centred around a ~4 times ionized plasma. In both cases 
we compare with simulations, which are discussed below.

FIG. 5.  (a) Lineout from two shots with a 50 mbar gas fill close to the source at z = 0.5-0.7 mm with incident flux 
~1019 ergcm-2s-1. The images are despeckled before the lineouts are taken (pixels replaced with median of a surrounding 
3 x 3 grid, conserving overall signal). For this lowest pressure case shot-to-shot variation in the profile can be seen 
more strongly than at higher pressures due to lower signal levels. (b) Raw data lineout (0.5-0.7mm) from a shot with 
152 mbar gas fill and a similar incident flux to (a). See the text for discussion of the simulations. In both figures we 
mark the positions of the expected K-α1 lines from different ion stages.  

Using the efficiency of L-shell emission, we can estimate ξ. Our model accounts for the profile of the X-ray 
focal spot (fitted to a super-Gaussian) and assumes a cos(q)1/2 variation in X-ray emission [15]. This allowed 
us to model the emission as a function of the distance in the direction normal to the focal spot, and also in the 
direction parallel to the focal spot plane. The spectrometer spatially resolves in the direction normal to the Sn 
foil  but  spatially  integrates  in  the  parallel  direction.  Partial  collimation  resulting  from  use  of  an  0.5mm 
aperture on the 0.5 mm thick substrate means that, close to the source, there is a limited lateral spread in the 
source size. In the spatially resolved direction, our lineouts are averaged over an approximately 200 µm wide 
region. Taking into account the spatial averaging in both directions, we calculate that the effective weighted 
flux of L-shell radiation is ~1.0 x 1019 erg/cm2/s at the peak of the pulse, with spatial variations of ±30%. For 
the 50 mbar case, at an electron density of 3.6 × 1018 cm-3 we have a weighted mean estimated value of ξ ~ 50 
erg cm s-1 (including the lower photon energy flux) at the peak of the flux.  In Fig. 6 we show the geometry 
relevant to the calculation of the flux with our experimental arrangement.

profile of the peak flux calculated as a function of the distance, defined as r in part (a) of the figure, and at a distance 
z=0.6 mm. Away from the centre, the recess walls block flux and thus the flux is restricted in spatial extent and thus 
value. (c) Peak flux at r=0 calculated as a function of z. We can see there is a steep gradient in flux as discussed in the 
text. 

To understand the expected behaviour of our plasma, we developed a simple time-dependent simulation model 
and assumed a uniform gas density for the duration of the X-ray drive. Collisional ionization data from Lotz 
[16]  is  fitted  along  with  dielectronic  recombination  and  radiative  recombination  rates  by  Shull  and  van 
Steenburg [17]. Shell-resolved photoionization cross-sections are from Verner and Yakovlev [18], and the 
fluorescence yields for K-shell vacancies from Kaastra and Mewe [19].  

We use a weighted average photon energy for the L-shell of 3.8 keV. In addition, we model the contribution 
of lower energy photons by an assumed black-body of temperature 175±10 eV, passing through a cold CH 
foil as discussed above by dividing them into 7 photons groups up to 1.75 keV. This can be used to calculate 
the expected ratio of 1s and 2s photoionization rates from Ar3+. Doing so leads to the same ratio as a black-
)’.*	keV. This is an important point of the technique as discussed by Hill 
body radiation temperature of 1.7&’.(
and Rose [11]. Our model assumes that the fluorescence and Auger decay of ions with an inner-shell vacancy 
occurs instantaneously compared to the timescale of the experiment. The electron temperature is fixed by the 
energy balance between the absorbed energy from photoionization, the energy lost to radiative recombination, 
K-α emission and bremsstrahlung (see e.g. [20]), and the energy contained in the plasma due to ionization. 
As with the Auger and fluorescence timescales, we assume a rapid thermalisation time between electrons, 
which for an electron density of >1018 cm-3 and temperature of 15 eV (see below) would be sub-ps for Z*=3 
[21]. The energies of the K-shell transitions were calculated with a Hartree-Fock model. 

As seen in Fig. 5, for the 50 mbar shots, the emission predicted by our model is peaked at about the same 
ionization stage as the experimental data, while for the 152 mbar case the simulated ionization is clearly lower 
than that observed and this trend continues for higher pressures. For all pressures, the predicted spectrum is 
narrower than experiment despite the inclusion of spatial and temporal averaging in the simulation. In Fig. 
7(a) we see the predicted rise in electron temperature as well as the emission history of K-α radiation for 
individual ion stages. An important parameter of a photoionized plasma is the degree to which photoionization 
dominates  over  collisional  ionization.  In  figure  7(b)  we  show,  for  our  weighted  averaged  conditions,  the 
simulated temporal history for the ratio of total collisional to total photoionization rates for the Ar3+ ion stage. 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
White et al 

It can be seen that, photoionization is dominant early on, but as the plasma heats up, the collisional ionization 
rate rises to about 6 times that due to photoinization at the peak of the flux. Of course, for the inner-shell 
ionization, the photoionization is totally dominant over collisional ionization under these conditions.

FIG. 7. (a) Calculated emission history using a simple plasma code as described in the text. The ion stages are those 
emitting the photons.  The temperature rises to above 20 eV before radiative losses cool the plasma, the main emission 
predicted to occur when the temperature is 15-20 eV. (b) Temporal history of the x parameter for the lowest two 
pressures studied. The ratio of collisional ionization to photoionization for Ar3+, shows that at early times prior to the 
peak flux we have a photoionization-dominated plasma.  

Since  one  of  our  aims  is  ultimately  to  help  benchmark  codes  relevant  to  astrophysical  sources,  we  have 
compared our data with simulations from the Cloudy code [22,23]. This code is steady state and not expected 
to be strictly valid for our experiment but the comparison is interesting. For the lower pressure case it severely 
overestimates  the  expected  ionisation,  as  might  be  expected.  Agreement  at  higher  density  may  partly  be 
explained by faster equilibration, but a more detailed consideration of the timescales expected (see Fig. 6(a)) 
leads us to believe this is insufficient. 

The fact that our time-dependent model predicts a lower ionization than the steady-state code is not surprising. 
However, it also predicts lower ionization than experiment and there are potential reasons we can consider. 
Firstly,  there  is  the  very  low  energy  photon  component  (up  to  500  eV)  for  which  the  outer-shell 
photoionization cross-section may be underestimated. However, the CH layer is thick and simulations suggest 
that during the drive laser pulse, there is little penetration of the heat front into the CH. A more likely scenario 
is energy transfer from the higher flux regions closer to the source (~1020 erg/cm2/sec for z=100 µm).  Some 
of the energy absorbed will be re-emitted as M-band photons in the ~200-300 eV range as 2s and 2p vacancies 
are created by photoionization and Auger decay. Radiation transfer from high flux regions  may increase the 
effective flux in adjacent plasma further from the focal spot. 

For  electrons  at  the  predicted  average  temperature  of  ~20  eV  for  the  50  mbar  case,  the  electron-electron 
equilibration time is of sub-ps duration. However, for the photoionized electrons, ejected with 0.5 to 1 keV 
energy, the electron-electron equilibration time is >50 ps for the 50 mbar case, with a collisional ionization 
time for reaching Z = 3 of ~20-30 ps. For these cases the mean-free-path of the electrons is of the order of 
several hundreds of microns and so we have to consider that energy can flow from higher to lower flux regions. 
These electrons would be below the threshold for K-α production but can ionize the outer shell electrons. 
Modelling  of  both  the  non-local  electron  transport  and  radiative  transfer  is  a  complex  problem  requiring 
detailed code development. However, we have attempted to estimate the effect of an incoming net flow of 
faster electrons from a higher flux region, closer to the Sn foil source by adding in a small percentage of ‘hot’

electrons. We have done this and the results in Fig. 8 show a stronger effect for higher pressure, which is 
consistent with our experimental observation that higher pressures do start to show higher average ionization.

FIG. 8. In this plot we show the time history of average ionization for three gas pressures. The incident flux of L-shell 
radiation is 1019 ergs/cm2/s and an additional 2% population of fast electrons is added assuming an effective 
temperature of 250eV. This adds about 25% to the energy deposited. More detailed modelling would be needed for a 
full understanding but this simple calculation shows that the effect is more pronounced for higher gas pressures. This is 
consistent with the higher ionisation observed for higher gas pressure in the data. 

In comparing our experiment to previous work, we note that our drive duration is somewhat shorter than some 
cases [8,10] but longer than others [9], and the K-α fluorescence is not emitted from a steady-state plasma. 
The drive flux of Foord et al [8] is higher, and our value of ξ is due to working at a lower electron density. 
Although  a  lower  density  is,  in  principle,  more  relevant  to  astrophysical  plasmas,  it  means  that  the 
equilibration time between electrons and ions is longer than the drive duration in our case. We also note that 
for the spatially-averaged drive conditions, the total photoionization rate from the Ar3+ ion stage is higher than 
the collisional ionization rate (50 mbar case) up until 150 ps before the peak flux, after which the collisional 
ionization  rate  rapidly  comes  to  dominate.  Thus,  although  the  plasma  is  completely  created  by 
photoionization, much of the time-integrated emission comes from plasma where collisional processes are 
dominant. This is a common situation for any laboratory-based experiments, but will also be a potential feature 
of plasmas in fusion environments and thus our experiments can still provide a relevant test for codes under 
a range of conditions. Further simulations using our simple model have indicated that for a steady flux at 1019 
erg  cm-2  s-1,  the  rate  of  absorption  of  energy  by  photoionization  would  be  balanced  by  losses  due  to 
bremsstrahlung and radiative recombination after ~ 20–30 ns, when the temperature would be much higher 
(> 150 eV) than in our non-steady-state experiment. On this timescale we may also reach equilibration in the 
electron  and  ion  temperatures  which  for  our  conditions  should  be  of  the  order  of  several  ns.  This  is 
encouraging, as there are higher energy laser systems than VULCAN that would be capable of sustaining such 
an X-ray flux for durations of this order. 

Summary 
In  summary,  we  have  implemented  a  proposed  experimental  technique  using  a  line  radiation  group  to 
photoionize a plasma in order to mimic a ~keV temperature radiation field . We have achieved photoionization 
parameters of ξ ~ 50 ergs cm s-1. The small spatial scale of the experiment and low starting density has helped 
in achieving this result but also means that more detailed modelling (including electron and photon transport) 
is needed due to the steep gradient in flux. Extension to larger energy laser systems may allow experiments 
with double-sided irradiation and larger spatial scales, thus mitigating the gradient issues and helping to create
