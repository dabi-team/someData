ABSTRACT

In this article, we present the multi–viewpoint and multi–wavelength analysis of an

atypical solar jet based on the data from Solar Dynamics Observatory, SOlar and He-

liospheric Observatory, and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory. It is usually be-

lieved that the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are developed from the large scale solar

eruptions in the lower atmosphere. However, the kinematical and spatial evolution of

the jet on 2013 April 28 guide us that the jet was clearly associated with a narrow CME

having a width of ≈ 25◦ with a speed of ≈ 450 km s−1. To better understand the link

between the jet and the CME, we did the coronal potential ﬁeld extrapolation from the

line of sight magnetogram of the AR. The extrapolations present that the jet eruption

follows exactly the same path of the open magnetic ﬁeld lines from the source region

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar jet is a common phenomenon of small scale plasma ejections from the solar lower atmosphere

towards the solar corona. Solar ﬂare or the base brightening at the jet footpoint is believed to

promote the force for pushing the plasma material upward. After the ﬁrst observational evidence of

solar jets by Shibata et al. (1992) using Yohkoh satellite observations in X-rays, jets now become

a popular research topic in solar physics. They are studied by many authors (Canﬁeld et al. 1996;

Alexander & Fletcher 1999; Nistic`o et al. 2009; Filippov et al. 2009; Hong et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2014;

Schmieder et al. 2013; Sterling et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016; Chandra et al. 2017b; Kayshap et al. 2018;

Liu et al. 2019; Ruan et al. 2019). From the previous reported results, it is now well accepted that 68

% of solar jets are active region (AR) jets (Shimojo et al. 1996; Sterling et al. 2017) and the length,

velocity and width have an average value of ≈ 1 x 104 – 5 x 105 km, 100 – 800 km s−1, and 103 – 105

km, respectively (Chandra et al. 2015; Sterling et al. 2016; Joshi et al. 2017). Raouaﬁ et al. (2016)

provides a comprehensive review of the coronal jet phenomena, including observations, theory, and

numerical simulations.

According to the eruption process, Moore et al. (2010) classiﬁed solar jets in two sub-classes, i.e.

standard and blowout jets. In a standard jet, the core ﬁeld of the base arch remains close and static

whereas in a blowout jet it explodes and results in a breakout eruption. They further clariﬁed that

about two-third of the observed X–ray jets fall in the standard picture of jets and one third are of

blowout category. The dichotomy of coronal jets into two categories is a result of the shear/twist

in the base arch of the jet. Blowout jets usually have a high shear/twist in the base to erupt and

open (Liu et al. 2009; Chandra et al. 2017b). Helicity can be transferred from the closed ﬁeld into

the open ﬁeld due to the reconnection between them. This ejection of helicity causes the motion of

3

the jet material upwards by nonlinear torsional Alfv`en waves (Pariat et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2019).

The magnetic reconnection between the closed and open ﬁeld lines is the causatum of magnetic ﬂux

emergence and cancellation. The continuous magnetic ﬂux cancellation and emergence destabilize

the ﬁeld at the jet base.

CMEs have attracted the solar physicists greatly as they are playing a signiﬁcant role in aﬀecting

the Earth’s space environment. Usually CMEs are associated with large scale solar eruptions, i.e.,

two–ribbon ﬂares (Joshi et al. 2016; Zuccarello et al. 2017), ﬁlament eruptions (Schmieder et al. 2013;

Chandra et al. 2017a), and occasionally with small scale solar eruptions, i.e., solar jets (Shen et al.

2012; Liu et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2016; Sterling 2018). Shen et al. (2012) reported two simultaneous

CMEs associated with a blowout jet. One of the two CMEs was bubble-like and the other was jet–

like. The authors suggested that the external magnetic reconnection produced the jet–like CME and

also led to the rise of a small ﬁlament underneath the jet base. Further, they explained that the

bubble–like CME is due to the internal reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Liu et al. (2015)

observed a coronal jet event which led to a high-speed CME (1000 km s−1), suggesting that large–

scale eruptions could be triggered by a small–scale jet. Zheng et al. (2016) reported another similar

event as a case study of solar jet activity which developed into a CME eruption.

However, the number of such jet–CME associated cases are too small for us to understand the

mechanism and kinematic processes behind the phenomenon. Here, we present a jet event followed

by a CME on 2013 April 28, which provides evidence of clear association of the jet and the CME.

The jet erupted with an initial speed of ≈ 200 km s−1 and developed into a CME together with

the ambient coronal structures. The paper is structured as follows: we present the data analysis in

section 2. The kinematics of jet and CME is given in section 3. Magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of the

jet source region is described in section 4. Finally, we discuss and summarize our results in section 5

2. DATA

The observational data for the jet eruption and the CME is taken from Solar Dynamics Observatory

(SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012), Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO, Kaiser et al. 2008)),

and Large-Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO, Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard SOlar and

4

Reetika Joshi et al.

Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO, Domingo et al. 1995). Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA,

Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO observes the Sun in seven EUV/UV wavelengths with a spatial

resolution of 0.6 arcsec and a cadence of 12 seconds. For the multi-thermal jet structure, we analysed

the AIA data in 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, and in 304 ˚A. For a better contrast of the hot

and cool counterparts of the jet, we create the base and running diﬀerence images of the AIA

data. To probe the jet and CME from multiple perspectives the EUV images taken by the Sun

Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI (Howard et al. 2008)) onboard

STEREO are analyzed. The twin spacecraft of STEREO mission, STEREO–A and STEREO–B

observe the Sun from two angles in four diﬀerent EUVI channels, 171 (Fe IX), 195 (Fe XII), 284 (Fe

XV), and in 304 (He II) ˚A. For our current analysis of the jet, we use the EUV images of STEREO–B

in 304 ˚A with a cadence of 10 minutes and pixel size of 1 arcsec. STEREO–A and B were separated

by 83◦ on 2013 April 28. To correct the projection eﬀect for the speed of jet, we use SCC−MEASURE

routine of SECHHI available in SolarSoft library in IDL. In this routine“tiepointing” technique is

used to reconstruct the three dimensional picture of the ejecting feature, by clicking the same feature

on both STEREO and SDO images (Thompson 2006; Gosain et al. 2009).

The CME is well observed with SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/COR coronagraphs. STEREO

COR1 has a ﬁeld of view from 1.5 to 4 R(cid:12) and provides the images with a cadence of 5 minutes,

while COR2 observes the corona from 2 to 15 R(cid:12). The LASCO observed the CME in the outer corona

upto 30 R(cid:12) with a cadence of 12 (C2) and 30 (C3) minutes. With the multi-point observations from

LASCO and COR, we employ the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to obtain the three–

dimensional height and direction of the CME (see section 3.2 ). We further analyse the photospheric

magnetic ﬁeld using the line-of-sight magnetograms from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI,

Schou et al. 2012) onboard SDO. For a closer and clear view of the jet source region, we use HMI

Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP, Bobra et al. 2014) data set with a cadence of 12

minutes.

indicated by the blue rectangular box in panel (a1). Panel (b2) and (b3) are the height–time analysis along

the source region with a speed of ≈ 60 km s−1. An animation (MOV1) of panels a1 and b2) is available,

which presents the jet eruption from its base towards the eastern limb from 20:50 UT to 21:57 UT.

3. KINEMATICS

3.1. Kinematics of the Solar Jet

The jet started to erupt ≈ 20:53 UT with a circular base, towards the northern direction from

the AR NOAA 11731 (N09E23) and observed in all six AIA channels (94 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A,

211 ˚A, and 304 ˚A). After reaching to some height at about 80 Mm, the jet material was deﬂected

from its original direction of propagation and revolved around the north–east direction. The jet was

initially bright (Figure 1(a2)), and afterwards followed with dark material (Figure 1(a1)), suggesting

impulsively strong heating at the initial phase. The following dark material was only visible in AIA

304 ˚A and not observed in hot channels, i.e. 171 ˚A. The propagation of the whole jet in AIA 304 ˚A

is shown in Figure 1(a1) along with the red curve C1, which indicates the deﬂection of the jet from

north direction to north–east direction towards the solar limb. The initiation of the jet from the

source region is shown in panel (a2). We also observed a small jet ejection at about 21:24 UT in the

eastern neighbourhood of the source region, and this jet material merged with the big jet (animation

is attached with Figure 1 as MOV1). Panel (b1) is the height–time plot of the jet along the slit C1.

The jet speed shows a two–stage proﬁle. The speed in the later stage is about 80 km s−1 towards

the north–east direction (red dotted line). For the velocity in the initial stage, we set two slits S1

and S2 (panel (a2) of 10 pixel width in two diﬀerent directions, and found that the speed in the S1

direction is 200 km s−1 and that the other direction S2 is about 160 km s−1 (as presented in panel

(b2) and (b3)). In addition to this, we found that a portion of the jet material falls back to the

source region around 21:51 UT with a speed of ≈ 60 km s−1, clearly appeared in height–time plot

along S2 direction in panel (b3).

From ≈ 21:16 UT, STEREO–B observed the cool counterpart of a jet in 304 ˚A above the western

limb. The full-disk image of AIA 304 ˚A and STEREO–B EUV 304 ˚A is presented in Figure 2. The

highest visible peak of the jet is indicated with a circle at the solar limb which is used to get the read

jet speed. Figure 3 (panel (c)) showed the locations of STEREO satellite, the Earth and the Sun.

With the aid of SCC−Measure procedure, we get the real speed and propagation direction of the jet

by clicking on the same feature in AIA 304 ˚A and in STEREO–B 304 ˚A image. The real jet-speed

was 200 km s−1 towards the north–east (longitude = -18◦, latitude = 19◦) direction. However, this

correction can be only applied to the second stage of the jet when it was propagating towards the

north–east direction, because we do not have the stereoscopic observations for the early stage of the

jet.

The + sign encircled with yellow circle shows the location of the leading edge of the jet at 21:56 UT. These

two positions of the leading edge of jet are obtained from the SCC−MEASURE technique which is used for

the jet velocity calculation.

3.2. Kinematics of the CME

The associated CME was well observed with SOHO/LASCO and STEREO–B COR1 and COR2

coronographs, as shown in Figure 3. The CME is not a typical one. It is narrow (width ≈ 25◦), and

likes a giant jet in the corona, no matter from which perspective the CME was viewed. The jet–

CME association is very much evident in STEREO–B observations (see Figure 3(e) and the attached

animation MOV2). For the continuous tracking of the solar jet in EUV channel (304 ˚A) and the

CME in coronagraphs, we put a slit in the jet–CME direction in STEREO–B EUV 304 ˚A, COR1

and COR2. The direction of the slit is shown in Figure 3(a). The continuous spatial and temporal

correlation between the jet and the CME is presented in Figure 3(e). The front of the CME is much

higher than the jet front and the separation between them is due to the expansion of the CME,

causing the speeds of their fronts are diﬀerent. If extrapolating them back to the solar surface, they

almost originated from the same time.

To reduce the projection eﬀect, we use the GCS model to get the real kinematic properties of

the CME. The GCS model is developed to represent the ﬂux rope structure of CMEs (Thernisien

et al. 2006; Thernisien 2011). It involves three geometric parameters: ‘h’, the height of the leading

‘θ’, ‘φ’, and ‘γ’, the Stonyhurst latitude and longitude of the source region, and the tilt angle of

the source region neutral line respectively. The GCS model is usually used to study morphology,

position, and kinematics of a CME based on the best ﬁtting result of a CME transient recorded in

white-light images. The ice-cream cone model is another model of CMEs, which composed of a ball

that we call the ice-cream ball and circular cone tangent to the ball with a conic node on the solar

surface (Fisher & Munro 1984). The GCS model becomes equivalent to the ice-cream cone model

when its parameter δ, equals 0 (Thernisien 2011). For our case study, we use the ice-cream cone

model which is a simpliﬁed form of the GCS model and estimated the three-dimensional height and

direction of the CME with LASCO C2, C3 and STEREO–B COR2 images. The best-ﬁtted GCS

model is displayed in Figure 4. The corrected CME speed from the GCS model comes out to be 450

km s−1.

Figure 5(a) depicts the complete kinematics of the jet and the CME with the diﬀerent data

points of various instruments. We have corrected the projection eﬀect for the jet and CME with

SCC−MEASURE and GCS model ﬁtting, respectively. The corrected jet speed comes out to be ≈

200 km s−1 from SCC−MEASURE associated with a CME of speed ≈ 450 km s−1. The blue and red

colors are used for corrected and uncorrected data points. This plot of temporal evolution shows the

clear link between the jet and the narrow CME. Figure 5(b) shows the intensity variation at the jet

base. The impulsive peaks at the jet base show the jet peak time in various AIA wavebands. The

enhancement in the light curve of EUV emission suggests that the energy injection was at the very

beginning only, and not responsible for the continuous acceleration of the jet to escape from the Sun.

The speed of the CME (450 km s−1) is much larger than that of a jet (200 km s−1). This is because

the speed of diﬀerent parts of erupting structures are measured. The speed of CME obtained from

the STEREO and LASCO observations is at its leading edge (vf ront). It consists of the propagation

speed of the CME center (vcenter) and the expansion speed (vexp) of the CME, so vf ront = vcenter +

vexp. A cartoon illustrating the CME speed at the leading edge, which includes the CME propagation

speed and expansion speed is given in Wang et al. (2015) (see their Figure 1). Gopalswamy et al.

(2009) derived a relation between CME propagation speed and expansion which is conﬁrmed in many

studies till now (Michalek et al. 2009; M¨akel¨a et al. 2016). With an approximation of the CME shape

by a shallow ice cream cone, the relationship is deﬁned as vexp = 2 vf ront sin(w/2), where ‘w is the

CME width (25◦ in present case). Therefore vexp comes out to be 230 km s−1 and vcenter should

be 220 km s−1. The jet triggeredand developedinto the CME and its trajectory should be followed

by the CME center and not by the leading edge of the CME. Thus, the jet velocity (200 km s−1)

is comparable with vcenter (vcenter < vf ront). That explains the diﬀerence between the jet and CME

speeds.

4. MAGNETIC CONFIGURATION OF THE SOURCE REGION

For a better understanding of the trigger mechanism of the solar jet, we did the magnetic ﬁeld

analysis of the source region using the HMI SHARP data (12 min cadence) of the AR 11731 on 2013

April 28. The continuous cancellation of the negative magnetic polarity by the emerging positive

magnetic spot is observed (Figure 6 and accompanying animation MOV3). The positive magnetic

polarity ate the negative magnetic polarity which was already distributed in the jet source region

(plotted inside the green circle in the panel (a) and (g)). Afterwards, small negative polarities emerges

from the large negative ball and get cancelled with the big positive polarity area. The emergence

of small negative polarities is shown with yellow arrows and the cancellation is indicated with cyan

arrows. To look at the variation of the magnetic ﬂux with time, we calculated the positive, negative

and total unsigned magnetic ﬂux at the jet source region, which is indicated as the red rectangular

12

arrows show the cancellation and emergence of negative magnetic polarity. Emergence of positive magnetic

polarity is enclosed by green circle in panel (a) and (g). Right panel (j) is the magnetic ﬂux variation with

time calculated at the jet source region indicated as red rectangular box in the left panel (e). Jet starting

time is highlighted with a green dashed line. Black, red, and blue curves are for the total, positive, and

negative magnetic ﬂux respectively. An animation for the magnetic ﬁeld evolution (a-i) is available from

16:00 UT to 22:36 UT.

box in panel (e). This is the same dimensional area we used to calculate the light curve in Figure 5(b).

The ﬂux variation with time in panel (j) shows that, there is a continuous cancellation and emergence

of the negative magnetic ﬂux (blue line) while the positive magnetic ﬂux emerges throughout (red

curve). The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (black curve) shows the simultaneous cancellation and

emergence of magnetic polarities at the jet source region. The emergence of the positive magnetic

ﬂux dominated over the cancellation throughout. The initiation of jet time is shown with a green

dashed vertical line.

( j ) 13

We analysed the magnetic topology at the jet location and applied two diﬀerent methods of potential

extrapolation, one for the global overview of the jet eruption, and the other for the local view at the

jet base region. The details are as follows:

We apply the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model (Schrijver & De Rosa 2003), to in-

vestigate the global magnetic topology near the jet source region. This PFSS technique uses the

HMI synoptic magnetic maps processed with a software package available in SSWIDL. We apply the

PFSS technique to see the reconnection between close loops and open ﬁeld lines because at large

scale the corona is in potential state (Schmieder et al. 1996). The PFSS model for this case study is

presented in Figure 7(a), with open (pink) and close (white) magnetic ﬁeld lines. These open ﬁeld

lines resemble exactly the path exactly the same as the jet, which was along the north direction in

the beginning and deﬂected towards the north–east afterwards.

To describe the magnetic topology of the jet base region, we extrapolate the coronal potential

ﬁeld using the photospheric Line of Sight (LOS) magnetogram as a boundary condition. The method

based on the Fourier transformation (FT) method proposed by (Alissandrakis 1981). The FT method

requires the vertical component of the photospheric vector ﬁeld as the input parameter. However,

due to HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld limited ﬁeld of view, the extrapolation hard to meet divergence–free

condition. Hence, we cut a larger patch of the LOS magnetogram instead. As the AR is close to the

central meridian, the LOS magnetic ﬁeld could represent the vertical ﬁeld to a large extent. In the

extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd open ﬁeld lines coincide well with the extension direction of the

jet shown in Figures 7b and c.

5. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In this article, we investigate a solar jet eruption from the AR NOAA 11731 on April 28, 2013. The

jet was ejected towards the north direction, and after reaching some height (80 Mm), it was deﬂected

in the north-east direction. The average computed speed of the jet was ≈ 200 km s−1. We found a

clear association of the observed jet with a narrow CME of speed 450 km s−1, observed in LASCO

C2, C3 and STEREO–B COR1, and COR2 coronagraph.

Figure 7. The PFSS extrapolation of the large FOV is shown in panel (a). The white and pink lines are

the closed and open magnetic ﬁeld lines at the jet location. The open ﬁeld lines are resembling in the same

way as of the jet propagation from its source to solar corona, which is indicated as curve C1 in ﬁgure 1(a1).

Panel (b) (AIA 304 ˚A) and (c) (HMI magnetogram) are showing the jet source region with the same FOV

as of the blue rectangular box in ﬁgure 1(a1). Cyan lines from the source region are the magnetic ﬁeld lines,

which shows closed structure at the jet base and open lines afterwards. Blue and green contours in panel

(b) are of negative and positive magnetic ﬁeld.

The escape speed of Sun is given as v =

R , where R is the distance from the center of the
Sun. The observed jet speed computed using the multi-view point observations is about 200 km s−1

(cid:113) 2GM(cid:12)

at the height of 2 R(cid:12). The escape velocity computed at the height of 2 R(cid:12) using the above formula

is ≈ 430 km s−1. Therefore, we conclude that the complete jet cannot be escaped from the solar

surface. This could be the reason we have observed the backward motion of the jet material from

the propagation direction towards the source region. Even the jet speed is lower than the escape

speed, we observed the clear CME associated with the jet by all the space-borne coronagraphs. The

possible mechanism for the jet continuously accelerating to reach the escape speed and form the

narrow CME is that the falling back material makes the upward material of the jet moving faster to

keep the momentum of the whole jet conserved. We concluded that the observed speed of the CME

is containing the speed of the CME center and the expansion speed, and is much larger than the jet

speed, because the diﬀerent parts of the erupting structures are being measured. The speed of CME

(a) 12:00 UT15

center (the trajectory followed by the jet) is 220 km s−1 and is equivalent to the speed of the jet (200

km s−1). This provides a clear evidence of the jet-CME association.

For the magnetic conﬁguration at the jet origin site, two views are popular. One is the magnetic ﬂux

emergence observed in many observations and also proposed in the MHD simulations (Shibata et al.

1992; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995; Moreno-Insertis et al. 2008; Moreno-Insertis & Galsgaard 2013;

Ruan et al. 2019; Joshi et al. 2020). Another is the magnetic ﬂux cancellation, which is also reported

in the observations MHD simulations (Pariat et al. 2009; Young & Muglach 2014; Chandra et al.

2017b; McGlasson et al. 2019). We have also studied the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in our investigation

and observed that there is a continuous emergence and cancellation of the negative magnetic ﬂux

and the positive ﬂux is emerging throughout. Therefore, we believe that both the ﬂux emergence

and the cancellation are responsible in our case.

In the potential ﬁeld extrapolation, we have found that the jet source region is covered (or overlaid)

by the closed ﬁeld lines and open ﬁeld lines. The open ﬁeld lines are in the direction of the jet ejection.

We have tried for the non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation, but it failed to reproduce

the magnetic ﬁeld topology of the AR. The ﬁeld lines of the NLFFF did not resemble with the loops

observed in the EUV passbands. It might because that the FOV of the photospheric vector magnetic

ﬁeld provided by HMI SHARP data is too small as it is available for signiﬁcant AR patch of solar

magnetic ﬁeld. Hence the divergence-free condition is not completely satisﬁed in the extrapolation,

which makes the NLFFF results unreliable. On the other hand, we mainly focus on the propagation

of the jet, which is more likely to be relevant to the nearly potential, large scale magnetic ﬁeld

connectivity. Therefore we believe that the potential ﬁeld extrapolation might be suﬃcient and the

direction of the jet ejection is the same as of the open magnetic ﬁeld lines we have obtained from the

potential ﬁeld extrapolation (see Figure 7). Hence we conclude that the reconnection between the

closed and open magnetic ﬁeld lines provides a path for the ejection of the jet.

We also observed the rotation in the jet material when it is propagating towards the north direction

from the source region (animation is attached as MOV1). The untwisting of the jet suggests the

injection of helicity to the upper atmosphere.

In summary, our study of a narrow CME caused by the jet gives worth evidence that some jets from

the solar disk can escape from the corona to form a CME, which may contribute to the space weather

phenomena. For our future study, we are looking forward to ﬁnding the clear in situ measurements

for such jet–like CMEs from the newly launched Parker Solar Probe.
