ABSTRACT
We present deep spectrophotometry of 18 H ii regions in the nearby massive spiral
galaxies M 101 and M 31. We have obtained direct determinations of electron tem-
perature in all the nebulae. We detect the C ii 4267 ˚A line in several H ii regions,
permitting to derive the radial gradient of C/H in both galaxies. We also determine
the radial gradients of O/H, N/O, Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O ratios. As in other
spiral galaxies, the C/H gradients are steeper than those of O/H producing negative
slopes of the C/O gradient. The scatter of the abundances of O with respect to the
gradient ﬁttings do not support the presence of signiﬁcant chemical inhomogeneities
across the discs of the galaxies, especially in the case of M101. We ﬁnd trends in the
S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O ratios as a function of O/H in M101 that can be reduced using
Te indicators diﬀerent from the standard ones for calculating some ionic abundances.
The distribution of the N/O ratio with respect to O/H is rather ﬂat in M31, similarly
to previous ﬁndings for the Milky Way. Using the disc eﬀective radius – Re – as a
normalization parameter for comparing gradients, we ﬁnd that the latest estimates of
Re for the Milky Way provide an excess of metallicity in apparent contradiction with
the mass-metallicity relation; a value about two times larger might solve the prob-
lem. Finally, using diﬀerent abundance ratios diagrams we ﬁnd that the enrichment
timescales of C and N result to be fairly similar despite their diﬀerent nucleosynthetic
origin.

1 INTRODUCTION

The analysis of collisionally excited lines (hereafter CELs) in
the spectra of H ii regions allows the derivation of the chem-
ical abundances of elements such as N, O, Ne, S, Cl, Ar and
Fe in the ionized gas phase of the interstellar medium (ISM).
These abundances trace the present-day chemical compo-
sition of the host galaxies at the locations where the H ii
regions lie. Spiral galaxies show radial variations of chem-
ical abundances along their discs – radial gradients – that
are essential observational constraints for chemical evolution
models. The form of such gradients reﬂects the action of nu-
clear processes in stellar interiors, and the eﬀects of the star
formation history and gas ﬂows in the chemical evolution of
galaxies.

C is the second most abundant heavy element in the

Universe after O, and is a major constituent of interstel-
lar dust and organic molecules with an indisputable bio-
genic importance. None of the ionic species of C that can
be present in H ii regions emit CELs in the optical range
of the spectrum and the determination of its abundance is
far more diﬃcult than for O or N, for example. Despite
its importance, there are rather limited determinations of
the C abundance in extragalactic H ii regions. Most of these
C abundances are derived from the C iii] 1909 ˚A and C ii]
2326 ˚A CELs in the UV, which can only be observed from
space and can be strongly aﬀected by the uncertainty in
the choice of UV reddening function (Garnett et al. 1995,
1999). A more robust determination can be obtained from
the C2+
ratio derived making use of UV CELs, whose
uncertainty due to reddening is minimal due to the close-
ness in wavelength between the C iii] and O iii] lines used to
derive such ionic abundances (e.g. Berg et al. 2016, 2019).
However, there is another possibility to derive C abun-

dances in ionized nebulae: the use of the faint recombi-
nation line (hereafter RL) of C ii 4267 ˚A, which has also
the advantage of lying in a spectral zone free of blend-
ing with other emission lines. There are several works re-
porting the detection of C ii 4267 ˚A and determination of
C abundance in extragalactic H ii regions (Esteban et al.
2002; Peimbert 2003; L´opez-S´anchez et al. 2007; Bresolin
2007; Esteban et al. 2009, 2014; Toribio San Cipriano et al.
2016, 2017). In particular, we obtained the ﬁrst determi-
nation of the C/H and C/O radial gradients of the ion-
ized gas in M101 (Esteban et al. 2009), M33 and NGC 300
(Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016), as well as the Milky Way
(Esteban et al. 2005, 2013).

M101 (NGC 5457, Pinwheel Galaxy) is a face-on
SABc spiral galaxy located at a distance of 6.7 Mpc
(Freedman et al. 2001). It contains a large number of bright
H ii regions. Kennicutt et al. (2003) determined the radial O
abundance gradient of this galaxy making use of direct de-
terminations of the electron temperature (hereafter Te) for
20 H ii regions. Bresolin (2007) presented spectroscopical re-
sults for some H ii regions of the inner disc of M101, deter-
mining the C abundance from the C ii 4267 ˚A RL for the sin-
gle region H1013. Deep spectroscopy taken by Esteban et al.
(2009) permitted, for the ﬁrst time, to estimate the radial
C/H gradient in M101. Li et al. (2013) observed 28 H ii re-
gions and derived Te for 10 of them, ﬁnding no evidence
for signiﬁcant large-scale azimuthal variations of the O/H
ratio across the disk of M101. Croxall et al. (2016) carried
out the most extensive study of the abundance gradients in
M101 to date, as part of the CHAOS (CHemical Abundances
Of Spirals) program (Berg et al. 2015). Croxall et al. (2016)
obtained direct determinations of Te for 74 H ii regions and
derived the radial gradients of the O/H, N/O, S/O, Ne/O
and Ar/O ratios.

M31 (NGC 224, Andromeda Galaxy) is an inclined SAb
spiral galaxy, the most massive component of the Local
Group, located at a distance of 744 kpc (Vilardell et al.
2010). Despite its closeness and obvious interest, there are
only few works devoted to the determination of the chemi-
cal composition of H ii regions in this galaxy. This is perhaps
due to the faintness of the H ii regions of M31. Blair et al.
(1982) determined the radial O abundance gradient but
based on empirical strong-line methods for estimating the
nebular metallicity (no direct determinations of Te). Later
on, Galarza et al. (1999) and Bresolin et al. (1999) were still
unable to detect auroral lines for deriving Te and also used
strong line methods for estimating O abundances. It was
not until 2009 when the ﬁrst determination of Te was ﬁnally
made for the H ii region K932 of M31 from spectra taken
with the 10m Keck I telescope (Esteban et al. 2009). Using
the same telescope, Zurita & Bresolin (2012) were the ﬁrst
to determine radial abundance gradients based on direct de-
terminations of Te for a sizable number of H ii regions of
M31, in 9 out of their 31 objects.

In this paper, we present very deep optical spectra of
11 and 7 H ii regions of the M101 and M31 galaxies, respec-
tively. The main aim is to determine the radial abundance of
C, N, O and other elements in these galaxies based on direct
determinations of Te. The paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we describe the sample selection, the observations
and data reduction procedure. In Section 3 we describe the
emission-line measurements and the reddening correction.

In Section 4 we present the physical conditions and ionic
and total abundances determined for the sample objects. In
Sections 5 and 6 we present and discuss our determinations
of the radial abundance gradients in M101 and M31, respec-
tively. In Section 7 we discuss our results focusing our atten-
tion on the C and N abundances and the enrichment of the
ISM in these elements. Finally, in Section 8 we summarize
our main conclusions.

2 SAMPLE SELECTION, OBSERVATIONS

AND DATA REDUCTION

The observations were performed with the 10.4 m Gran
Telescopio Canarias (GTC) at the Observatorio del Roque
de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain). The H ii regions of
M101 were observed in service mode using one-hour observ-
ing blocks distributed in several nights in March 2014, May
2015 and between March and May 2016. The objects of M31
were also observed in service mode in December 2017. The
spectra were taken with the OSIRIS (Optical System for
Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spec-
troscopy) spectrograph (Cepa et al. 2000, 2003), which con-
sists of a mosaic of two Marconi CCD42-82 CCDs each with
2048 × 4096 pixels and a 74 pixel gap between them. Each
pixel has a physical size of 15µm. We used a binning 2 ×
2 for our observations, giving a plate scale of 0.254 arcsec.
OSIRIS was used in long-slit mode, centering the objects in
CCD2. In some cases, the slit covered two nearby H ii re-
gions and eventually one of them fell onto CCD1. The slit
length was 7.4 arcmin and its width was set to 0.8 arcsec.
We used three grisms – R1000B, R2500V and R2500U – for
all objects except for NGC 5447, H37, H1118 and H1146.
For these four objects we only used R1000B and R2500U.
R1000B covers the whole optical spectral range, from 3600 to
7750 ˚A achieving an eﬀective spectral resolution of 6.52 ˚A.
This grism was used to determine the reddening coeﬃcient
and to measure the lines redder than He i 5876 ˚A. R2500V
and R2500U give eﬀective spectral resolutions of about 2.46
˚A. R2500V covers from 4430 to 6070 ˚A and was used to de-
blend the RLs of multiplet 1 of O ii around 4650 ˚A from the
[Fe iii] 4658 ˚A line. The third grism, R2500U, covers from
3430 to 4620 ˚A and was used to improve the detection and
measurement of C ii 4267 ˚A and deblend [O iii] 4363 ˚A from
nearby sky and nebular emission features.

The total integration time of the spectra taken with
each grism varied from 1350 to 5520 s depending on the
object and observing run. We took three or six consecutive
exposures in each case. Additional 60 s exposures were taken
with the R1000B grism – and R2500V for the brightest ob-
jects – in order to avoid problems with the possible satu-
ration of the brightest lines. The position of the centre and
position angle (PA) of the slit were selected in order to cover
the brightest zones of the nebulae. In some cases, where two
nearby H ii regions could be observed with the same slit po-
sition, the PA was ﬁxed to facilitate the simultaneous obser-
vation of both objects. The extension of the extracted area
in each bidimensional spectrum optimizes the signal-to-noise
ratio of the intensity of several faint lines, especially for C ii
and O ii RLs – when these lines were detected – as well as
the [O iii] 4363 ˚A and [N ii] 5755 ˚A auroral lines, which are

necessary for the determination of the electron temperature
Te (see Section 4.1).

Table 1 shows the relevant parameters of the observa-
tions of H ii regions of M101 and M31. The diﬀerent columns
give the coordinates of the centre of the extracted aperture,
the fractional galactocentric distance of the object in units
of the isophotal radius (R/R25), the position angle (PA), the
aperture size of the extraction, the mean Hα surface bright-
ness – uncorrected for reddening – in the extracted area,
the gratings used, the mean airmass and the total expo-
sure time. The airmasses of the observations go from 1.11
to 1.38 (mean of 1.18) for the objects of M101 and from

1.02 to 1.68 (mean of 1.26) for M31, so the zenith distance
was never larger than 53◦ and usually about 35◦. The atmo-
spheric diﬀerential refraction is not expected to be a problem
for these observations because the objects are several arcsecs
extended.

The fractional galactocentric distance of the objects
R/R25 (the Galactocentric distance normalized to the isopho-
tal radius of the disk, R25). has been taken from the litera-
ture or recalculated using recent determinations of the pa-
rameters of the galaxies. In the case of M31, the R/R25 ra-
tios for BA310, BA371, BA374 and BA379 have been taken
from Zurita & Bresolin (2012). For the rest of the objects of

M31, we have used the galactocentric distance obtained by
Blair et al. (1982) and Galarza et al. (1999), recomputed as-
suming the parameters used by Zurita & Bresolin (2012), i.e.
an inclination angle of 77◦ (Corbelli et al. 2010) and a dis-
tance of 744 kpc (Vilardell et al. 2010). The OSIRIS spectra
were reduced using iraf1 v2.16. Data reduction followed the
standard procedure for long-slit spectra. The spectrograms
were wavelength calibrated with Hg-Ar, Ne and Xe lamps.
The absolute ﬂux calibration was achieved by observations
of the standard stars Ross 640, G191−B2B, Feige 66, Hiltner
600, GD140 and GD153. We used polynomials of relatively
high order – 5 to 7 – to properly ﬁt the sensitivity curves of
the R1000B spectra and avoid problems with the ﬂuxes of
the H i Balmer lines. Particular care was taken in the back-
ground subtraction because the sky background emission is
not completely homogeneous along the GTC OSIRIS long
slit (Fang et al. 2015).

3 LINE INTENSITY MEASUREMENTS

Line ﬂuxes of the spectra of the H ii regions of M101 and
M31 included in Table 1 were measured with the splot rou-
tine of iraf by integrating all the ﬂux in the line between
two given limits and over the average local continuum. All
line ﬂuxes of a given spectrum have been normalized to Hβ
= 100.0. In the case of line blending, we applied a double
or multiple Gaussian proﬁle ﬁt procedure using the splot
routine of iraf to measure the individual line intensities.
The identiﬁcation of the lines was made following our previ-
ous results on deep spectroscopy of extragalactic H ii regions
(see Esteban et al. 2009; Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016).
The number of lines detected and identiﬁed in the objects
depends mainly on their surface brightness and varies from
26 in H1146 to 96 in NGC 5455. In Figure 1 we show the
spectra of those two H ii regions and K160 of M31.

We detect broad emission features that characterize the
spectra of massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in several H ii
regions. In NGC 5455, H219 and H1118 of M101 (the fea-
tures were previously detected in NGC 5455 by Croxall et al.
2016) and in K160 of M31. In all the objects we detect both
the so-called blue and red WR bumps, indicating the pres-
ence of WR stars of the nitrogen and carbon sequences, WN
and WC. The blue WR bump consists of the blend of the
broad He ii 4686 ˚A, C iii/C iv 4650 ˚A and N iii 4640 ˚A lines
and originate mainly from the emission of WN stars. The
red bump is produced by the blend of C iii 5698 ˚A and C iv
5808 ˚A broad emission lines. This last one is the strongest
emission line of WC stars, but is barely seen in WN stars.

The observed line intensities have been corrected for
interstellar reddening. This was done using the reddening
constant, c(Hβ), obtained from the intensities of the Balmer
lines. However, the ﬂuxes of the H i lines may be also aﬀected
by underlying stellar absorption. Consequently, we have per-
formed an iterative procedure to derive both c(Hβ) and the
equivalent widths of the absorption in the H i lines following

have used the reddening function,
derived by Cardelli et al. (1989) – assuming RV = 3.1 – and
the observed Hα/Hβ, Hγ/Hβ and Hδ/Hβ line ratios deter-
mined from the spectra obtained with the R1000B grism. We
have considered the theoretical line ratios expected for case
B recombination given by Storey & Hummer (1995) for the
physical conditions derived for the nebulae – see Section 4.1.
In tables A1 to A6 – provided as Supplemental Appendix at
MNRAS online – we include the list of line identiﬁcations
– ﬁrst 3 columns, the reddening function, f (λ) – fourth col-
umn – and dereddened ﬂux line ratios with respect to Hβ –
remaining columns. The quoted line intensity errors include
the estimated ﬂux calibration error (∼ 2 percent), uncertain-
ties in line ﬂux measurement and error propagation in the
reddening coeﬃcient. Colons indicate line intensity errors of
the order or greater than 40%. The last two rows of each
table include the reddening coeﬃcient and the observed –
uncorrected for reddening – integrated Hβ ﬂux, F(Hβ), of
the extracted aperture for each object.

4 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND CHEMICAL

ABUNDANCES

For the 18 H ii regions of M101 and M31 observed we have
determined the physical conditions – electron temperature,
Te, and density, ne – and the ionic abundances making use of
the version 1.0.26 of pyneb (Luridiana et al. 2015) in com-
bination with the atomic data listed in Table 2 and the line-
intensity ratios and their uncertainties given in tables A1 to
A6 of the Supplementary Appendix.

4.1 Physical Conditions

We have derived ne using the density-sensitive emission
line ratios [S ii] 6717/6731 and [O ii] 3726/3729 for all
the objects, but also [Cl iii] 5518/5538 for some of them.
The [S ii] and [O ii] indicators give consistently small den-
sities in all cases and lower than 100 cm−3 in most of
them. Three objects show ne([Cl iii]) substantially larger
than the other two indicators, but the values have very
large uncertainties and have not been considered. Te([O ii])
and Te([N ii]) have been corrected from the contribution
to the intensity of the [O ii] 7319, 7330 ˚A and [N ii]
5755 ˚A lines due to recombination following the formu-
lae derived by Liu et al. (2000) and making a prelimi-
nary estimation of the N2+
abundance in the nebulae. We
have determined Te using the following emission line ratios:
[O ii] (7319+7330)/(3726+3729),
[N ii] 5755/(6548+6584),
[S ii] (4069+4076)/(6717+6731),
[O iii] 4363/(4959+5007)
and [Ar iii] 5192/(7136+7751). The physical conditions of
all the objects are presented in Table 3. We assume a two-
zone approximation for the nebula, estimating the repre-
sentative values of the electron temperature for the zones
where low- and high-ionization potential ions are present,
Te(low) and Te(high). Those values will be used for deter-
mining ionic abundances except for some particular ions,
as will be explained in sections 4.2 and 5.3. When two or
more indicators of Te for low-ionization potential ions are
reported, Te(low) is calculated as the mean of Te([N ii]),

Te([O ii]) and Te([S ii]) weighted by their inverse relative er-
rors. The suitability of Te([S ii]) to calculate the mean may
be questionable. S0 has an ionization potential lower than
H0, O0 or N0 and the zone were S+
lies may include parts
of the nebula outside the ionization front, where the physi-
cal conditions of the gas may be diﬀerent. In any case, the
values of Te([S ii]) are consistent with those obtained with
the other Te indicators for low ionization species within the
errors. NGC 5471 is an exception, and shows an abnormally
high value of Te([S ii]), which has not been considered for
determining Te(low). The Te(high) was determined as the
weighted mean of Te([O iii]) and Te([Ar iii]) when both quan-
tities are obtained in a given nebula. All Te determinations
are included in Table 3. Several objects lack one of the tem-
perature determinations, Te(low) or Te(high), in these cases
the temperature that cannot not be calculated is estimated
using equation 3 of Esteban et al. (2009), which is based on
results for similar H ii regions observed in the Milky Way
and other local galaxies.

such as O2+
. We used other tempera-
ture indicators for some particular ions due to the reasons
outlined in Section 5.3 and following the prescriptions by
Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019). We used Te([N ii]) – or
Te(low) when that indicator is not available – for determin-
ing Cl2+
abundances (see Section 5.3), and the average of
Te([O iii]) and Te([N ii]) – or Te(high) or Te(low) when one of
those are not available – for S2+
(see Section 5.3).
The computations were made with pyneb and using
the atomic data listed in Table 2. We have measured several
RLs of He i in all the objects and of He ii, C ii and/or O ii
in some of them. The He
abundance has been determined
using pyneb, Te(high) and the eﬀective recombination co-
eﬃcient computations by Porter et al. (2012, 2013) for He i
lines, that include collisional and optical depth eﬀects in
the line intensities. The ﬁnal adopted He
abundance is the
weighted average of the ratios obtained from the individual
brightest He i lines measured in each object. We detect the
He ii 4686 ˚A line in NGC 5471 and H681, two H ii regions lo-

cated in the external disc of M101. We have determined the
He2+
abundance with pyneb using Te(high) and the eﬀective
recombination coeﬃcient calculated by Storey & Hummer
(1995). In both objects, the He2+
ratios are very small
and do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the total He abun-
dance. We have measured the C ii 4267 ˚A line in the H ii
regions NGC 5455, NGC 5471, NGC 5462, NGC 5447 and
H37 of M101 and K160 of M31. The quality of the detec-
tions of the C ii 4267 ˚A line can be noted in Figure 2. We
compute the C2+
ratios from the measured ﬂux of the
C ii 4267 ˚A RL, Te(high), and the C ii eﬀective recombina-
tion coeﬃcients calculated by Davey et al. (2000) for case
B. The RLs of multiplet 1 of O ii have been only detected
in NGC 5455 and NGC 5471. We have determined the O2+
abundance from these lines making use of the eﬀective re-
combination coeﬃcients for case B and assuming LS cou-
pling calculated by Storey (1994) and considering Te(high).
The relative populations of the O ii levels do not follow lo-
cal thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) for densities ne <
104 cm−3 (Ruiz et al. 2003). We use the prescriptions of
Peimbert & Peimbert (2005) to calculate the appropriate
corrections for the relative strengths between the individ-
ual O ii lines. Tables 4 and 5 give the ionic abundances – as
well as their uncertainties – for all the observed objects.

For the two objects where O ii RLs have been measured,
NGC 5455 and NGC 5471, we were able to calculate the O2+
abundances from both RLs and CELs. We have not consid-
ered the O ii 4638.86 and 4641.81 ˚A lines for the calculations
because they can be blended with N iii 4640.64 ˚A and N ii
4643.06 ˚A lines at the spectral resolution of our observa-
tions. It is a well-established fact that O2+
abundances deter-
mined from RLs are always larger than those obtained from
CELs, with diﬀerences typically ranging between 0.20 and
0.45 dex in H ii regions (see Garc´ıa-Rojas & Esteban 2007;
Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2017). This phenomenon is the
so-called abundance discrepancy, ADF, that in the case of
O2+
ra-
tio determined from RLs with respect to CELs in logarithmic
units (Liu et al. 2000). We obtain an ADF(O2+
) = 0.13 ±
0.10 for NGC 5455 and of 0.19 ± 0.11 for NGC 5471, both de-
terminations lying in the lower range of typical values for H ii
regions. As in other previous papers of our group, we have
made the exercise of assuming the validity of the temper-
ature ﬂuctuations paradigm for explaining the abundance
discrepancy. Doing this, we can estimate the t2 parameter
that produces the agreement between the abundance of O2+

, ADF(O2+), is deﬁned as the diﬀerence of the O2+

For these two objects, Table 4 lists the ionic abundances de-
termined for the t2 values we have estimated as well as the
standard procedure of not considering temperature ﬂuctu-
ations, i.e. assuming t2 = 0. For the rest of the objects –
for which we do not detect O ii RLs – the calculations have
only been made assuming t2 = 0. The abundances for t2 >
0 have been calculated following the formalism outlined by
Peimbert & Costero (1969) and updated by Peimbert et al.
(2002).

/H

In H ii regions, O is commonly the only element for
which no ionization correction factor (hereafter ICF) is nec-
essary to derive its total abundance. Therefore, the total O
+
abundance can be calculated simply by adding the O
/H
and O2+
ratios. Although we detect He ii lines in the
spectra of two of our H ii regions – indicating that some
should be present in those objects – their small He2+
O3+
/
H+
ratio implies that the contribution of O3+
to the O/H
ratio is much smaller than the uncertainties and clearly neg-
ligible. For the other elements, we have to assume ICFs to
correct for the contribution of ionization stages not showing
detectable emission lines in the optical range.

Ar from CELs, we adopted the ICFs scheme proposed by
Izotov et al. (2006) based on photoionization models of ex-
tragalactic H ii regions. These authors propose diﬀerent
ICFs depending on the element and the metallicity range
of the nebulae. We used the expressions for ”high” metallic-
ity – 12+log(O/H) obtained from CELs ≥ 8.2 – for most of
the H ii regions of both galaxies. For SDS323 we used the ex-
pressions for ”intermediate” metallicity – 12+log(O/H) ob-
tained from CELs ∼ 7.6. For H11146, H1118, NGC 5471,
H681 and BA374, with values of 12+log(O/H) between 7.6
and 8.2, we used linearly interpolated ICFs between ”inter-
mediate” and ”high” metallicity cases. For Fe, we adopted the
ICF scheme suggested by Rodr´ıguez & Rubin (2005) which
is based on the computed Fe2+
ratio and photoionization
models (their equation 2).

In the case of C, we used the mean value of several
ICF(C2+
) schemes based on photoionization models: (a) the
relation obtained by Garnett et al. (1999) based on mod-
els ﬁrstly described by Garnett et al. (1995); (b) the scheme
proposed by Berg et al. (2019) that includes dependence on
the metallicity and the ionization parameter; and (c) the
sets of ICF(C2+
) calculated by Medina Amayo (2019), based
on a subset of photoionization models by Vale Asari et al.
(2016). The values of the C/H ratio given in tables 4 and 5

correspond to the application of the mean of the ICF(C2+
)
values obtained with the three schemes for each object, ex-
cept in the case of K160, whose O/H ratio exceeds the limit
of applicability of the ICF(C2+
) of Berg et al. (2019). The
uncertainty assigned to the C abundance corresponds to the
/H+
combination of the observational error of the C2+
ra-
tio and the dispersion of the diﬀerent ICF(C2+
) values used
for the mean. The C/H ratios obtained with the ICF(C2+
)
of Garnett et al. (1995) are systematically larger – about
0.06 ± 0.07 dex – than those obtained with the scheme pro-
posed by Berg et al. (2019). The C/H ratios obtained with
the ICF(C2+
) of Medina Amayo (2019) are more consistent
with the results obtained with the Berg et al. (2019) rela-
tions, being only about 0.02 ± 0.02 dex larger.

We have several objects in common with the previ-
ous study on abundances of H ii regions in M101 carried

out by Croxall et al. (2016): NGC 5462, NGC 5455, H1216,
NGC 5471, H219, NGC 5447, H681 and H1146. Our O/H
ratios are on average 0.10 dex lower than those computed
by Croxall et al. (2016), with a dispersion of 0.07 dex (see
Sect 5.1 ). It is important to remark that Croxall et al.
(2016) and us use the same atomic datasets for the O+
and O2+
ions. The reason of the systematic diﬀerences in
abundance is that our Te determinations for the objects
are higher in almost all objects. On average, the Te val-
ues used for deriving O2+
abundances are about
600 K and 400 K, respectively, higher than those obtained
by Croxall et al. (2016). In the case of M31, we have four
objects in common with the previous spectroscopic observa-
tions by Zurita & Bresolin (2012): BA310, BA371, BA374
and BA379. The mean diﬀerence between our O/H ratios

5 RADIAL ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS IN

M101

5.1 Oxygen

Fig. 3 shows the radial distribution of the O abundances
– calculated from CELs – of the sample of H ii regions in
M101 as a function of their fractional galactocentric dis-
tance (R/R25). We have also included data for H1013 and
NGC 5461 obtained by Esteban et al. (2009) for which we
have recalculated the physical conditions and abundances
following the same methodology and atomic data than for
the rest of the objects of this paper. H1013 and NGC 5461
correspond to the two innermost objects shown in Fig. 3,
located at R/R25 = 0.20 and 0.33 and with 12+log(O/H)
= 8.44 and 8.41, respectively. We have performed a least-
squares linear ﬁt to the R/R25 ratio of the nebulae and their
O abundance. The ﬁt is indicated by a solid red line in Fig. 3
and has the parameters given in the equation given below:
12 + log(O/H)CELs = 8.69(±0.04) − 0.86(±0.05)R/R25.

(1)

For comparison, in Fig. 3, we have also included the least-
squares ﬁt obtained by Croxall et al. (2016), whose slope
and intercept are −0.83 ± 0.04 dex (R/R25)−1 and 8.72 ±
0.02, respectively. Both ﬁts are consistent within the errors.
The scatter of the O abundances represented in Fig. 3 with

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

respect to the gradient ﬁtting at the corresponding distance
of the H ii regions is ±0.04 dex. This is what Croxall et al.
(2016) deﬁne as internal dispersion; they obtain a value of
about 0.07 dex for their larger sample of H ii regions of M101.
Croxall et al. (2016) argue that the internal dispersion is
larger than expected by the formal uncertainties of the data,
not ﬁnding a clear cause for it but concluding its intrinsic
nature. We think that this claim is debatable. In Section 4.2
we said that the mean diﬀerence in the O/H ratios obtained
by us and Croxall et al. (2016) for the H ii regions of M101
in common is about 0.10 dex, a value larger than the ”inter-
nal dispersion”. It is very diﬃcult to ascertain the reason of
this systematics. One possibility is the unintentional bias in-
troduced by the use of diﬀerent methodologies of measuring
weak lines (see Rola & Stasi´nska 1994). But other reasons
are also arguable, such as anomalies in the relative ﬂux cali-
bration along the optical spectrum, or observations of diﬀer-
ent parts of objects with signiﬁcant spatial variation of their
physical properties, among others. In Fig. 4 we plot the O/H
ratios and O radial gradient obtained from our data and the
O abundances we derive using the emission line ratios mea-
sured by Croxall et al. (2016) and Kennicutt et al. (2003)
for the objects in common with our sample and applying
our methodology and atomic data. In the ﬁgure, we can see
that the diﬀerent O abundances for the same object diﬀer
by values usually larger than the formal errorbars given in
the papers. The average dispersion of the various determi-
nations of the O/H ratio for a given object is about 0.04
dex, slightly smaller than the internal dispersion found by

a Assuming t2 = 0.0 and in units of 12+log(X+n/H+) or 12+log(X/H).

Croxall et al. (2016) but of the same order of the value es-
timated by us. This result suggests that uncertainties lower
than about 0.04 or 0.05 dex for the O abundances may be
somewhat underestimated and that the internal dispersion
may not necessarily be related to chemical inhomogeneities
across the disc of M101.

As it was commented in Sect. 4.2, we can determine the
O2+
abundance from O ii RLs in two objects of the sam-
ple, NGC 5455 and NGC 5471. Esteban et al. (2009) ob-
served O ii RLs in additional H ii regions of M101: H1013,
NGC 5461 and NGC 5447. This last object is included in

our sample, but the O ii lines were not detected in the GTC
spectra. We have recalculated the O2+
abundances of these
three objects using the same methodology and atomic data
and – as indicated in Sect. 4.2 – excluding the O ii 4638.86
and 4641.81 ˚A lines. We have calculated the O/H ratio –
(O/H)RLs – using the O2+
abundance from O ii RLs and the
O+
abundance determined from CELs and assuming t2 > 0.0
(these values are also included in Table 4). We obtain val-
ues of 12+log(O/H)RLs of 8.75 ± 0.13, 8.49 ± 0.10 and 8.57
± 0.11 for H1013, NGC 5461 and NGC 5447, respectively.

can derive a radial O gradient with abundance determina-
tions based on RLs (see Fig. 5), whose parameters are:
12 + log(O/H)RLs = 8.81(±0.27) − 0.75(±0.55)R/R25.
The ﬁt has very large uncertainties due to the large errors
of the individual O/H ratio determinations and the small
baseline of R/R25. The slope of the ﬁt is not substantially
diﬀerent from the one obtained from CELs, but the ﬁt shows
a clear oﬀset of about 0.2 dex (see Fig. 5), which is due to
the abundance discrepancy factor (see Sect. 4.2).

The radial C abundance gradient of M101 was studied by
Esteban et al. (2009), who determined the C/H ratio for
H1013, NGC 5461 and NGC 5447 and use the previous –
but rather uncertain – determination for NGC 5471 obtained
by Esteban et al. (2002). In this paper, we present C abun-
dances for three new objects: NGC 5461, NGC 5455 and
H37 as well as better determinations based on higher S/N
ratio detections of the C ii 4267 ˚A line for NGC 5447 and
NGC 5471. In total, we have C/H ratios for seven H ii re-
gions of M101. We have recalculated the C abundances of

H1013 and NGC 5461 following the methodology indicated

tios are those obtained from O ii RLs. Other spiral galax-
ies also show negative slopes of their C/O gradient (e.g.
Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016) reﬂecting the non-primary
behavior of C enrichment.

5.3 Other elements

We have also determined total abundances of N, Ne, S, Cl
and Ar but their exact values rely on the ICFs assumed for
each element.

N/O is a very interesting abundance ratio because the
bulk of both elements are produced by diﬀerent stellar pro-
genitors with diﬀerent enrichment timescales. We have de-
termined this abundance ratio using the O abundance cal-
culated from CELs. Fig. 7 shows the N/O ratio as a function
of the O abundance for the sample of H ii regions of M101.
We see an increase of N/O with O/H when 12+log(O/H) >
8.0 and a constant value at lower metallicities. This is a well-
known behaviour, which is related to the primary/secondary
nature of N production and the anticorrelation between
the O yield and metallicity. In the ﬂat regime, N is pri-
mary in origin and simply increases in lockstep with O.
At higher metallicities, the combination of two eﬀects pro-
duces the upturn in the N/O ratio. Firstly, the increase
of the secondary production of N and, secondly, the de-
crease of the production of O by massive stars at higher
metallicities (Henry et al. 2000). The linear least-squares ﬁts
of the data represented in Fig. 7 with 12 + log(O/H) ≥
8.0 gives a slope of 1.24 ± 0.30; consistent with the value
of ∼ 1.3 obtained by Croxall et al. (2016). Our data give
a mean value of log(N/O) = −1.29 ± 0.08 for the four
objects with the lowest O/H ratios. We obtain the same
value when assuming the standard approximation of N/O
≃ N+
(Peimbert & Costero 1969) instead of the ICF
scheme by Izotov et al. (2006) for deriving the total N abun-
dance. Croxall et al. (2016) obtain log(N/O) = −1.43 ± 0.11
for the plateau of the N/O versus O/H distribution.

Fig. 8 shows the Ne/O ratio versus O abundance for
the sample of H ii regions of M101. We see that the Ne/O
trend is basically ﬂat, with a mean value of log(Ne/O) =

Figure 9. Trends in the abundance ratios relative to oxygen as a function of 12+log(O/H) for H ii regions in M101. The left panels
correspond to total abundances based on ionic abundances of S2+, Cl2+ or Ar2+ determined using Te(high). The right panels correspond
to total abundances based on abundances of twice-ionized atoms following the prescriptions by Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019): using
Te([N ii]) – or Te(low) – for determining S2+ and the mean of Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]) – or Te(low) and Te(high) – for Cl2+ and Ar2+. The
continuous and dotted red lines in the right panels represent the weighted mean and standard deviation of the values, respectively.

−0.84 ± 0.15. There are two objects with log(Ne/O) below
−1.0 but with relatively large O/H ratios, H219 and H1013.
In fact, H219 is outside the band deﬁned by one standard
deviation around the weighted mean of the Ne/O ratios of
the rest of the objects. Those two nebulae might be part
of the apparent low-Ne/O population of H ii regions found
by Croxall et al. (2016) (see their ﬁgures 6 and 9). Those
authors claim that such population is statistically conﬁrmed
and does not display unusual deﬁcits in other abundance
ratios such as N/O, S/O, or Ar/O, and this seems also to
be the case according to our data (see Fig. 9). However,
H219 and H1013 are precisely the nebulae of our sample
showing the lowest O2+
ratios. Therefore, the apparent
two populations in the Ne/O versus O/H diagram might be
an artifact produced by the ICF schemes at low ionization
degrees. The suitability of this explanation will be discussed
in Arellano-C´ordoba et al. (in preparation).

of O/H. Stellar nucleosynthesis predicts that these distri-
butions should be ﬂat, as it has been corroborated in dif-
ferent observational works. In the left panels of Fig. 9 we
represent the S, Cl and Ar abundances determined using
Te(high) for deriving S2+
. This is the stan-
dard recipe when assuming the two-zone scheme for calcu-
lating ionic abundances. However, we can see that all the
three abundance ratios show rather clear trends with O/H.
This behaviour was not noted in the case of the Ne/O ratio
(see Fig. 8) and also when representing S/Ar or Cl/Ar ver-
sus O/H. We made the same plots using the ICF schemes
by Medina Amayo (2019) (see Section 4.2) but the trends
did not disappear. Although Croxall et al. (2016) claim that
the distributions of S/O and Ar/O ratios with respect to
O/H are ﬂat, we think that their ﬁgures 6 and 7 might
suggest some trend fairly similar to that shown in the left
panels of our Fig. 9. Kennicutt et al. (2003) also claim the
absence of any trend in their S/O versus O/H plot (their

ﬁgure 9) but again, this ﬂatness is arguable to us. In a
very recent work Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019) report
exactly the same behaviour we ﬁnd for the S/O, Cl/O and
Ar/O (not in Ne/O) ratios, but for a sample of 37 Galac-
tic and extragalactic H ii regions with high-quality spec-
tra. Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019) propose that using
Te([N ii]) instead of Te(high) for determining S2+
abundance
and the mean of Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]) instead of Te(high)
for Cl2+
the abundance ratios distributions become
ﬂatter and show a lower dispersion for a given O abundance.
The results we obtain following Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al.
(2019) can be seen in the right panels of Fig. 9. The S,
Cl and Sr abundances included in tables 4 and 5 are those
obtained following these prescriptions. The average abun-
dance ratios we obtain following these criteria are log(S/O)
= −1.59± 0.09, log(Cl/O) = −3.52 ± 0.10, log(Ar/O) =
−2.46 ± 0.11. It must be highlighted that, as we can see in
Fig. 9, all the objects (except one in the Ar/O as a function
of O/H diagram) are consistent within the errors with the
band deﬁned by one standard deviation around the weighted
mean of the abundance ratios. The physical reason for the
prescriptions proposed by Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019)
does not seem to be related solely to the ionization potential
of the ionic species involved. Perhaps the diﬀerent shapes of
the photoionization cross-sections may be playing a role but,
in any case this should be further explored with the help of
photoionization models.

6 RADIAL ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS IN

M31

We have obtained spectra of seven H ii regions of M31.
Four of them, BA310, BA371, BA374 and BA379 were
also observed by Zurita & Bresolin (2012). The mean dif-
ference between the O abundance determined by us and by
Zurita & Bresolin (2012) for those objects in common is only
0.01 ± 0.05 dex. In Fig. 10 we show the radial distribution

Figure 11. Trend of the N/O ratio as a function of 12+log(O/H)
for H ii regions in M31. The continuous and dotted red lines rep-
resent the weighted mean and standard dispersion of the values,
respectively. Symbols are the same as in Fig 10.

of the O abundances – calculated from CELs – of our sam-
ple H ii regions in M31 as a function of their R/R25 ratio.
We have also included data for BA312, BA362, BA419 and
BA422 observed by Zurita & Bresolin (2012) and K932 (ob-
served by Esteban et al. 2009) for which we have recalcu-
lated the physical conditions and abundances following the
same methodology and atomic data as for the rest of the
objects of this paper. With these 12 H ii regions with di-
rect determinations of Te, we obtain the radial O abundance
gradient given below:
12 + log(O/H)CELs = 8.61(±0.15) − 0.31(±0.21)R/R25;

(5)

which is much ﬂatter than the O gradient determined for
M101 (see Eq. 1). For comparison, in the ﬁgure, we have also
included the least-squares ﬁt obtained by Zurita & Bresolin
(2012), whose slope and intercept are −0.56 ± 0.28 dex
(R/R25)−1 and 8.72 ± 0.18, respectively. Unfortunately, as in
the case of Zurita & Bresolin (2012) our observational points
cover only two distinct quite narrow zones of galactocentric
distances (these zones can be easily seen in the combined
GALEX+Spitzer image shown by Zurita & Bresolin 2012,
their ﬁgure 2). It is clear that further Te-based abundance
determinations at diﬀerent distances from the M31 center
would be desirable, but the lack of bright H ii regions out-
side those star-forming annuli in the disc of M31 is a draw-
back for such a goal. The scatter of the O abundance of H ii
regions represented in Fig. 10 and the linear ﬁt at their cor-
responding distance is ± 0.10 dex, larger than in the case of
M101. We conclude that the presence of chemical inhomo-
geneities in the disc of M31 is more likely than in the case of
M101. However, we have to take into account the fact that
the mean uncertainty of the individual O/H determinations
for the H ii regions of M31 is about 0.07 dex – larger than
in the case of M101 – and the high inclination angle of M31
introduces an additional uncertainty in the estimation of the
galactocentric distance of the H ii regions.

Unfortunately, we did not detect O ii RLs in any of the
H ii regions observed in M31. The only region where these
lines have been reported is K932 (Esteban et al. 2009). How-
ever, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table A5 the C ii 4267 ˚A line was
detected in K160. We found a rather high C/H abundance
in this object (see Table 5). Although there are only two H ii
regions with C/H ratio determinations available in M31, we

can estimate a tentative radial gradient for 12+log(C/H),
ﬁnding a slope of −2.00 ± 0.77 dex (R/R25)−1, a much steeper
– but also far more uncertain – C gradient than in the case
of M101.

In Fig. 11 we plot the N/O ratio as a function of the O
abundance for the H ii regions of M31. In contrast to what
was found for M101 (Fig. 7), the N/O ratio in M31 shows
a rather ﬂat distribution with respect to O/H, with a mean
log(N/O) = −0.81 ± 0.12.. This behaviour was also reported
by Zurita & Bresolin (2012) and will be further discussed in
Sect. 7.2.

In Fig. 12 we show the total abundances of Ne,
S, Cl and Ar with respect to O as a function of the
oxygen abundance for the H ii regions of M31. As in
the case of M101, we have followed the prescriptions by
Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019) for determining the total
abundances. We have used Te(high) for calculating Ne2+

Te([N ii]) – or Te(low) – for Cl2+
and the mean of Te([N ii])
and Te([O iii]) – or Te(low) and/or Te(high) – for S2+

. The abundance ratios do not show clear trends and
the average values – as well as the dispersions –, log(Ne/O)
= −0.85 ± 0.17, log(S/O) = −1.57 ± 0.08, log(Cl/O) = −3.50
± 0.11 and log(Ar/O) = −2.40 ± 0.08 are almost identical
to those found for M101.

7 DISCUSSION

7.1 About the normalization of radial gradients

Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2016) found that the radial
C/H abundance gradients are steeper than those of O/H

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

in spiral galaxies. In addition, they found a correlation be-
tween the slope of the C/H gradient and the galactic abso-
lute magnitude MV when the abundance is represented as
a function of R/R25. In Table 6 we show the slope of the
O, C and N gradients with respect to R/R25 and R/Re for
M101 and M31, the Milky Way (Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas
2018) and other nearby spiral galaxies: M33 and NGC 300
(Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016). In the table, we also give
the morphological type, R25, the eﬀective radius (Re) and the
absolute V-band magnitude (MV) of the galaxies. The val-
ues of Re have been taken from Zurita, Florido et al. (in
preparation), who determine it from the radial scale length
of the disc (Rd) using the relation: Re = 1.678 × Rd (e.g.
S´anchez et al. 2014) valid under the assumption of an ex-
ponential disc. In the case of M33, M101 and NGC 300,
we have used the Rd values calculated by Zurita, Florido
et al. from the ﬁtting of the r-band surface brightness pro-
ﬁles. Those authors recommend to use the value of Rd ob-
tained by Licquia et al. (2016) for the Milky Way and the
one obtained by Courteau et al. (2011) from the I-band
light proﬁle for M31. The comparison between radial abun-
dance gradients of diﬀerent galaxies has been done nor-
malizing the radial galactocentric distance to either R25 or
Re. In most published works, the normalization parameter
is R25 (e.g. Rosales-Ortega et al. 2011; Croxall et al. 2016;
Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016), not only for the abun-
dance gradients but also to study the radial proﬁles of other
main galaxy properties as, for example, dust, gas, stars or
star formation rate (e.g. Casasola et al. 2017). Diaz (1989)
argued that Re is the most appropriate parameter for nor-
malizing the abundance gradients because it is related to the

mass concentration and reﬂects the recycling rate of the gas
in diﬀerent galaxies (see S´anchez et al. 2012). Using the data
presented in Table 6 for the ﬁve galaxies, we ﬁnd that the
relative standard deviation – the ratio of the standard devi-
ation to the mean – of the gradient slopes becomes smaller
– almost a factor of two lower – when Re is used as normal-
ization parameter except in the case of C, for which using
R/R25 or R/Re gives the same relative standard deviation.
However, removing the slope of the C/H gradient of M31 –
which is the most uncertain one because it relies only on two
objects – the relative standard deviation using Re becomes
equally smaller for all chemical elements. In the following,
we will use Re as our preferred normalizing parameter for
the comparison of radial abundance gradients.

Fig. 13 shows the radial O, C and N abundance gra-
dients of M31, M101, the Milky Way, M33 and NGC 300
with respect to R/Re. In the left panel, we can see that
the H ii regions of the Milky Way (red crosses) show O, C
and N abundances larger than those of the remaining galax-
ies for the same R/Re ratio. This indicates that the Milky
Way seems to have an average metallicity at Re larger than
the more massive and luminous galaxies M31 or M101, in
contradiction with what we would expect from the mass-
metallicity relation. This apparent metallicity excess of the
Milky Way would be alleviated if the true Re of the Milky
Way is larger than the value determined from the Rd pro-
posed by Licquia et al. (2016). In fact, a Re about twice
larger would reconcile the values of O, C and N with re-
spect to R/Re of the Milky Way with those of the other
galaxies. Although this might seem simply an argument of
convenience, a larger true Re is a possibility that certainly
cannot be ruled out. The diﬀerent measurements of Rd over
the last few decades have provided a fairly wide range of val-
ues, between 1 and 5 kpc, although the latest determinations
tend towards values smaller than 2.6 kpc (e.g. Sackett 1997;
Amˆores et al. 2017). On the other hand, as Licquia et al.
(2016) have pointed out, small values of Rd cause the Milky
Way to be located outside the three-dimensional luminosity-
velocity-radius scaling relation. Values of Rd about 5 kpc –
twice as large as the one we assume – would be necessary for
solving that anomaly. Finally, another remarkable feature in
the left panel of Fig. 13 is that the C abundances in H ii
regions of M31 are considerably higher than in M101, M33
or NGC 300 for the same R/Re ratio.

In the right panels of Fig. 13 we represent the abun-
dances normalized to the ones corresponding to Re in order
to wash out the eﬀect of the diﬀerent mean metallicities of
the galaxies. Using this representation, it is easier to note
that the gradient slopes are in general fairly similar, espe-
cially in the cases of O and N. We see a larger dispersion
for the C/H gradients, but this is mostly due to the rather
steeper slope of M31, which – as has been said before –
shows the largest uncertainty. Another fact we can note in
the central right panel of Fig. 13 – and Table 6 – is the
lack of correlation between the slope of C/H gradient and
the MV of the galaxies in contrast with what was found by
Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2016) when using R25 as a nor-
malization parameter.

Figure 15. Log(C/N) versus 12+log(O/H) determined from
CELs for H ii regions in M31, M101 and other spiral and dwarf
galaxies. Symbols are the same as in Fig. 14. C abundances are
determined from RLs and N abundances from CELs.

7.2 About the C and N enrichment

Fig. 14 shows the C/O versus O/H ratios for the H ii re-
gions of M101 and M31 and others from the literature.
The C/O ratio has been derived from C and O abun-
dances determined from RLs and the O/H ratio repre-
sented in the abscissae is derived from CELs. This is a
new version of a plot presented in Esteban et al. (2014) and
Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2016, 2017). The ﬁgure shows
a well-known correlation originally found by Garnett et al.
(1995, 1999) that demonstrates the diﬀerent enrichment
time-scales of C and O. Red circles represent our data for
M31 and blue squares for M101, the rest of the symbols cor-
respond to other spiral and dwarf galaxies (see the caption
for a description of the symbols and references). We can see
that the C/O ratios of the H ii regions of M31 and M101

follow the general C/O versus O/H trend, with K160 the
object with the largest C/O ratio. Berg et al. (2016, 2019)
obtain C/O ratios from UV CELs for a sample of metal-
poor dwarf galaxies, covering a range of 12+log(O/H) from
7.4 to 8.0 and ﬁnding an average value of log(C/O) = −0.71
± 0.17. Those authors suggest that the large scatter of C/O
is due to the diﬀerent star formation eﬃciencies, burst du-
ration and supernova feedback of the dwarf galaxies located
in the low-metallicity regime. In this context, the position of
NGC 2363 reported by Esteban et al. (2014) (the point with
the lower O/H ratio in Fig. 14), with a C/O ratio of −0.29
dex, might be interpreted as a star-forming burst at its lat-
est moments of evolution, when the C/O has increased to its
largest value because the O production has exhausted but
C is being ejected by slower-evolving stars. It is interesting
to note the position of NGC 5471 in the C/O versus O/H
diagram. This is the H ii region belonging to a large spiral
galaxy (M101) with the lowest O abundance for which we
have a C/O ratio derived from RLs. Its C/O ratio of −0.39 is
larger than most of the H ii regions of the Small Magellanic
Cloud – with similar O/H ratios – and also larger than the
aforementioned mean value of the C/O ratio of metal-poor
dwarf galaxies determined by Berg et al. (2019). However,
the position of NGC 5471 in Fig. 14 is compatible with the
results of chemical evolution models of the Milky Way – as-
suming that our galaxy is representative of a prototypical
large spiral galaxy – presented by Esteban et al. (2013) for
H ii regions located beyond the isophotal radius, that pre-
dict values of C/O of about −0.40 dex (see Esteban et al.
2014, their ﬁgure 6).

Fig. 15 shows the C/N versus O/H ratios for the H ii
regions of M101 and M31 and other galaxies from the lit-
erature. The C abundances have been derived from RLs
and N and O abundances from CELs. The C/N ratios
should only be considered as indicative because of the abun-
dance discrepancy problem. Actually, the C/N ratios would
be smaller in the case where both lines are determined
using the same kind of lines, optical RLs or UV CELs
(e.g. Garc´ıa-Rojas & Esteban 2007; Esteban et al. 2016).
Fig. 15 shows a rather large dispersion of the C/N ratio
for 12+log(O/H) > 8.1 but a remarkably smaller one for
lower metallicity objects. From the ﬁgure, one can guess
some trend of a slightly increasing C/N at lower metallic-
ities. This contrasts with the lack of correlation found by

Garnett et al. (1999) or the opposite tendency reported by
Kobulnicky & Skillman (1998) using UV CELs. Berg et al.
(2016, 2019) also ﬁnd a ﬂat C/N versus O/H trend for
metal-poor dwarf galaxies but with a very large dispersion,
log(C/N) = 0.75 ± 0.20. The log(C/N) values we ﬁnd for ob-
jects with 12+log(O/H) ≥ 8.0 are between 1.2 and 1.4, sub-
stantially larger than the C/N ratios obtained by Berg et al.
(2016, 2019) from UV CELs and this diﬀerence should be
an eﬀect of the abundance discrepancy problem. In fact,
Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2016, their ﬁgure 5) reported
that the diﬀerence between the C2+
ratio determined
from RLs and that calculated with UV CELs – the so called
abundance discrepancy (AD) – increases as the O abundance
decreases. The amount of such AD is consistent with the ob-
served C/ N trend. The object at 12+log(O/H) ∼ 8.2 with
the lowest C/N ratio in Fig. 15 corresponds to the zone of
NGC 5253 where L´opez-S´anchez et al. (2007) reported lo-
calized N and He pollution produced by massive Wolf-Rayet
stars. In Fig. 15, we can also see that the C/N ratio of
NGC 5471 is in complete agreement with the C/N ratios
of H ii regions of the SMC having similar O abundance.

/H+

Fig. 16 plots the C/O ratio determined from RLs for
the objects included in ﬁgures 14 and 15 as a function of
their N/O ratio determined from CELs. The ﬁgure shows
that the C/O and N/O abundance ratios are tightly corre-
lated, with a slope close to 45◦. As reported by Esteban et al.
(2014), this trend is in agreement with the predictions of the
chemical evolution models for the Milky Way presented by
Esteban et al. (2013), that reproduce the position of H ii re-
gions in the discs of spiral galaxies and the slope of the cor-
relation. Figures 15 and 16 indicate the coupling between C
and N enrichments in H ii regions. Esteban et al. (2014) pro-
pose that, despite the fact that the nucleosynthesis processes
of both elements are diﬀerent, their enrichment time-scales
result to be rather similar due to the cumulative-temporal
contribution of the C and N yields by stars of diﬀerent
masses. According to Carigi et al. (2005), at high metallic-
ities, 12+log(O/H) ≥ 8.5, the main contributors to C and
N should be massive stars. However, at intermediate metal-
licities, 8.1 ≤ 12+log(O/H) ≤ 8.5, the main contributors to
C are low metallicity low-mass stars, but for N the main
producers are massive stars and intermediate-mass stars of
intermediate and low metallicity, respectively. Based on their
results for low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, Berg et al. (2019)
also highlight the similar behaviour shown by the C and N
enrichment. They propose that the signiﬁcant scatter of the
C/O and N/O ratios indicate their production by stars of
diﬀerent average masses.

As we can see in ﬁgures 7 and 11 and commented
in Sect. 6, the trend of N/O as a function of O/H is
very diﬀerent in M101 and M31. In the case of M101, it
i.e. constant N/O for lower
follows the typical relation,
metallicities and increasing N/O for growing O/H due to
the production of secondary N for large metallicities (e.g.
P´erez-Montero et al. 2016; Belﬁore et al. 2017) but in the
case of M31 the N/O ratio is virtually ﬂat. In the upper
panel of Fig. 17 we compare the N/O versus O/H trend for
M101 with the data for H ii regions of M33 and NGC 300 ob-
tained by Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2016) from Te-based
abundances. The upper panel of Fig. 17 indicates that the
three galaxies follow the standard N/O versus O/H trend.

and for M33

In fact, this is reﬂected by the presence of negative linear
radial N/O gradients in them.

A negative radial N/O gradient is a common prop-
erty in spiral galaxies. There are several studies dedicated
to determine and analyze N/O gradients in large samples
of spirals. However, these extensive studies use strong-line
methods for estimating abundances because they usually
lack direct determinations of Te. Pilyugin et al. (2004) us-
ing published spectra of H ii regions of 54 spiral galaxies
and applying the P-method for estimating the O abun-
dance, found negative slopes of the N/O gradient in virtually
all their sample galaxies. This is also the general result of
Belﬁore et al. (2017), who use resolved spectroscopic data
from the SDSS IV MaNGA survey for 550 nearby galax-
ies. However, P´erez-Montero et al. (2016) using spectra of
H ii regions in a sample of 350 spiral galaxies of the CAL-
IFA survey, ﬁnd that about 4-10% of their galaxies display
a ﬂat or even a positive radial N/O gradient. The results
shown in Fig. 11 and the lower panel of Fig. 17, illustrate
the fact that, contrary to what happens in most spiral galax-
ies, M31 and the Milky Way show a rather constant N/O
ratio across their discs. P´erez-Montero et al. (2016) indi-
cate that there are no diﬀerences between the average in-
tegrated properties of their whole sample and the subset
of galaxies with ﬂat or inverted N/O gradient, ﬁnding no
special feature that could explain this odd behavior. The
relation between the N/O ratio and metallicity is a sub-
ject of intense debate (e.g. McCall et al. 1985; Thuan et al.
1995; Henry et al. 2000; Izotov et al. 2006; Vincenzo et al.

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2019)

2016; Vincenzo & Kobayashi 2018). On the other hand, nu-
cleosynthesis models produce very diﬀerent stellar yields of
N depending on the assumptions made in the stellar evo-
lution models (e.g. Woosley & Weaver 1995; Marigo et al.
1996, 1998; Portinari et al. 1998; Hirschi et al. 2005;
Kobayashi et al. 2011; Chieﬃ & Limongi 2013). Therefore,
the presence of a ﬂat N/O versus O/H relation in a galac-
tic disc has a diﬃcult and non-unique explanation. In their
paper about the N and O abundance gradients in the Milky
Way, Esteban & Garc´ıa-Rojas (2018) pointed out that the
constant N/O ratio would indicate that the bulk of N should
have a primary origin, and this would be also the situa-
tion in M31. Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of
galaxies by Vincenzo & Kobayashi (2018) using the stellar
yield set by Kobayashi et al. (2011) ﬁnd almost ﬂat trends in
N/O versus O/H diagrams when ignoring the contribution
of failed supernovae. Finally, the chemical evolution mod-
els by Vincenzo et al. (2016) highlight the importance of
the star-formation eﬃciency (SFE) on ﬁxing the value of
the N/O ratio for a given O abundance. According to these
models, a lower SFE results in a lower production of oxy-
gen per unit time by massive stars decreasing the metallicity
of the corresponding regions. If there is a delay in the pro-
duction of nitrogen, the N/O ratio will increase. Therefore,
radial changes of SFE may be another possibility to mod-
ulate the behaviour of the N/O versus O/H diagram for a
given galaxy.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We present deep spectra of 18 H ii regions in the nearby mas-
sive spiral galaxies M101 and M31. The data have been ob-
tained with the OSIRIS spectrograph attached to the 10.4 m
Gran Telescopio Canarias telescope. We have obtained di-
rect determinations of the electron temperature in all the
nebulae. We detect the pure recombination line of C ii 4267
˚A in one H ii region of M31 and in ﬁve of M101, including a
good quality measurement of this line for NGC5471, a giant
H ii region in the outskirts of M101. We derive the C/H ra-
tio for those H ii regions and determine the radial abundance
gradient of this element in both galaxies. We also determine
the radial abundance gradients of O as well as those of the
N/O, Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O ratios. As in other spiral
galaxies, the C/H gradients are steeper than those of O/H
giving rise to a negative slope of the C/O gradient, a fact
that reﬂects the non-primary behavior of C enrichment.

The dispersion of the O abundance of the H ii regions
of M101 with respect to the computed radial gradient is
±0.04 dex, of the order of the uncertainties of the individ-
ual O/H ratio determinations, indicating the absence of sig-
niﬁcant chemical inhomogeneities across the disc of M101.
Conversely, for M31 we ﬁnd a higher internal dispersion, of
about ±0.10 dex. Although, in principle, we cannot discard
the presence of some chemical inhomogeneities, we have to
consider that (a) the individual O/H ratio determinations of
the H ii regions of M31 have an average uncertainty of 0.07
dex, considerably larger than for M101, and (b) the high
inclination angle of M31 makes the determination of galac-
tocentric distances for the H ii regions of this galaxy more
uncertain.

Contrary to what is expected, we ﬁnd trends in the

20

C. Esteban et al.

S/O, Cl/O and Ar/O ratios as a function of O/H in M101
when using the standard methods for deriving S, Cl and
Ar abundances. These trends are reduced when applying
the prescription by Dom´ınguez-Guzm´an et al. (2019), using
Te([N ii]) instead of Te(high) for determining S2+
and the
mean of Te([N ii]) and Te([O iii]) instead of Te(high) for Cl2+
and Ar2+
. The ﬁnal average values of the Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O
and Ar/O ratios are almost identical for M101 and M31.

/H+

Contrary to what is found for M101 and most other
spiral galaxies, the distribution of the N/O ratio with respect
to O/H is rather ﬂat in M31. It should be noted that this is
also the behavior found in the Milky Way by several authors
suggesting that the bulk of N should have a primary origin
in both galaxies, although other explanations are possible.
The use of Re as normalization parameter of the radial
distance provides lower relative standard deviations when
comparing the gradient slopes of the diﬀerent galaxies. The
comparison of the radial gradients with respect to R/Re of
M101, M31, M33, NGC 300 and the Milky Way suggests
an apparent metallicity excess in the Milky Way. This odd
behavior might be solved if the true Re is about two times
larger than the most recent determinations.

Using diﬀerent diagrams involving C, N and O abun-
dances, we explore the coupling between C and N enrich-
ments in H ii regions. We ﬁnd that, despite the fact that the
nucleosynthesis processes of C and N are diﬀerent, their en-
richment time-scales result to be rather similar due to the
cumulative-temporal contribution of the C and N yields by
stars of diﬀerent masses.
