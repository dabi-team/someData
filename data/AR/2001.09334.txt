Abstract  The  flow  above  idealized,  two-dimensional  series  of  parallelepipedal  buildings  is 
examined with the aim of investigating how the building width (W) to height (H) aspect ratio affects 
the turbulence in the roughness sublayer and the ventilation of the underlying street canyons. We 
compare the case of buildings with a squared section (ARB = W/H = 1.0) with a configuration with 
slender buildings (ARB = 0.1) both in the case of unit canyon width (D) to height (H) aspect ratio 
(ARC  =  D/H  =  1)  and  in  the  case  of  ARC  =  2.  The  former  corresponds to  skimming  flow  and  the 
latter  to  wake-interference  regime.  Measurements  are  performed  in  a  water  channel,  measuring 
velocity on a vertical mid-plane using a particle image velocimetry technique. The mean flow, its 
second-order  turbulence  statistics,  the  exchange  fluxes,  and  the  integral  time  scales  investigated, 
with results showing that slender buildings enhance turbulence production and yield longer integral 
time  scales  in  the  region  just  above  the  building  roof.  Namely,  in  the  skimming-flow  and  wake-
interference regimes,  the  maximum  vertical velocity  variance  is more  than  doubled and increased 
by 50%, respectively. The combined analysis of the turbulence production fields and the snapshots 
of the flow during sweep and ejection events demonstrate that the shear layer between the canyon 
and  the  external  flow  is  significantly  more  unstable  with  slender  buildings,  mainly  because  the 
damping  effect  of  the  vertical  velocity  fluctuations  from  the  flat  roof  of  the  upwind  building  is 
substantially missing. Consequently, a larger (downstream) portion of the interface is prone to the 
direct  interaction  of  the  external  flow  structures.  The  higher  turbulence  intensity  promotes  the 
ventilation  at  the  canyon  interface,  which  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  two  in  the  skimming-flow 
regime and a factor of 1.26 in the wake-interference regime. In summary, the present experiments 
show that the effect of the reduced building aspect ratio is particularly significant when the urban 
canopy  consists  of  narrow  canyons.  The  result  is  of  interest  since  narrow  street  canyons  are 
typically bounded by slender buildings in the urban texture of the old European city centres.

1 Introduction 
Understanding  the  mechanisms  that  drive  turbulent  exchange  between  the  urban  canopy  and  the 
overlying boundary layer is crucial for assessing urban air quality and therefore the citizen exposure 
to  pollutants  released  at  the  pedestrian  level  (Britter  and  Hanna  2003;  Ng  2009;  Fernando  et  al. 
2010; Blocken et al. 2016). The complex urban morphology, resulting from the combination of the 
intricate  street-network  pattern  and  the  heterogeneity  of  building  geometry,  is  known  to 
considerably affect the turbulent flow which, in turn, determines the pollutant dispersion (Fernando 
et  al.  2001;  Kastner-Klein  et  al.  2004).  Thus,  an  accurate  estimation  of  flow  characteristics  in  an 
urban  environment  should  consider  the  real  geometry  of  the  investigated  area  (Carpentieri  and 
Robins  2015).  However,  both  the  experimental  and  numerical  flow  simulations  in  the  case  of 
realistic  geometries  suffer  from  the  drawbacks  of  being  expensive  and  giving  information  that 
cannot be easily extended to other configurations (Zajic et al. 2015). 

Therefore, in order to gather information that can be generalized to large sets of configurations, 
many  studies  have  been  performed  on  simplified  geometries,  focusing  on  the  effect  of  particular 
morphological features on the turbulent flow and dispersion. Initially, the effect of the street-canyon 
aspect  ratio  both  in  two-  and  three-dimensional  configurations  has  been  investigated  (Oke  1988; 
Hagishima et al. 2009; Zajic et al. 2010; Di Bernardino et al. 2014, 2015; Simón-Moral et al. 2014). 
Other  researchers  described  the  importance  of  the  building  shape,  including  details  about  the 
building  morphology  (Richardson  and  Surry  1991;  Kanda  and  Maruta  1993;  Ozmen  et  al.  2016; 
Ferrari  et  al.  2017;  Garau  et  al.  2019).  Recently,  Murena  and  Mele  (2016),  with  their  numerical 
simulations,  found  that  the  presence  of  balconies  can  determine  a  significant  modification  in  the 
flow  field  inside  two-dimensional  street  canyons,  which,  in  turn,  produces  less  effective  mass 
exchange with the atmosphere above. Llaguno-Munitxa et al. (2017) confirmed the negative role of 
facade  elements  on  the  turbulent  mixing  above  a  building  array,  whereas  they  observed  that 
complex roof geometries tend to increase the mixing. Numerical simulations described by Badas et 
al.  (2017),  and  water-channel  experiments  of  Garau  et  al.  (2018)  highlighted  how,  in  presence  of 
two-dimensional  canopy,  pitched  roofs  modify  the  turbulence  structure  inside  the  canyons  and 
deepens the shear layer at their upper interface. 

The building aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of the width to the height of the building), has received 
much less attention, and most of the above-mentioned configurations were based on squared section 
buildings.  However,  as  the  slope  of  the  roof  has  a  decisive  effect  in  redirecting  the  flow  just 
upstream from the canyon and changing the interfacial shear-layer characteristics, so the length of a 
flat roof (non-dimensionally coinciding with the building aspect ratio) may change the airflow and 
the turbulent exchange. Actually, Hosker (1984) described the flow patterns near isolated buildings 
of different aspect ratios subject to a perpendicular incident wind, showing how the presence of a 
roof recirculating region and its possible reattachment depends on the building aspect ratio. In the 
case of an urban canopy of rectangular-prism-shaped obstacles, Sadique et al. (2017) examined the 
influence of roughness-element aspect ratio on the mean and turbulent velocity fields and pointed 
out how its effect is different in the case of aligned and staggered obstacles.  

Boundary-layer modiﬁcations due to regular wall roughness, aligned in the spanwise direction, 
also have received much attention in the field of turbulent channel ﬂows. However, most research 
was  focused  on  the  effect  of  varying  the  fluid  gap  between  the  solid  bars,  i.e.,  the  canyon  aspect 
ratio  (Cui  et  al.  2004;  Leonardi  et  al.  2007).  Macdonald  et  al.  (2018)  performed  direct  numerical 
simulations (DNS) of high aspect ratio spanwise-aligned bars in a turbulent boundary layer. They 
showed that for deep cavities, when the obstacle height is greater than three times the bar spacing, 
the overlying flow only depends on the bar spacing and not on the bar height. This would imply that 
the building aspect ratio has an influence on the above flow up to a threshold value. These results 
were  obtained  from  DNS  in  the  case  of  d-type roughness  (corresponding  to  skimming  flow),  and 
considering obstacles with equal width and spacing. Other authors studied the effect of the upstream 
turbulence by varying the geometry of the roughness upwind of the investigated two-dimensional 
canyon  (Perret  et  al.  2017;  Blackman  et  al.  2018).  Jaroslawski  et  al.  (2019)  deepened  the  same

issue, focusing on the spanwise structure of the flow and its interaction with large-scale structures, 
which  is  fundamental  to  predict  lateral  flows.  However,  the  above  studies  considered  only 
roughness  elements  consisting  of  cubes  or  squared  section  bars.  In  the  case  of  a  squared  section 
canyon, the interaction between the cavity flow and the overlaying boundary layer was observed to 
be mediated by a shear layer that develops horizontally from the vertex of the upstream wall (Perret 
and  Savory  2013).  Salizzoni  et  al.  (2011)  analyzed  the  shear-layer  instability,  concluding  that  it 
depends  both  on  the  velocity  difference  across  the  shear  layer  and  the  length  scales  of  the 
turbulence. 

However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the influence of the building aspect ratio was 
not  specifically  addressed  in  the  case  of  a  two-dimensional  urban  canopy.  Cai  et  al.  (2008) 
compared  two-dimensional  urban  canopy  simulations  both  consisting  of  squared  and  rectangular 
section buildings (specifically, the building width was one third of the building height). Comparing 
the results of these simulations, the authors stated that the effect of building width is insignificant 
on the flow with respect to canyon width. Nonetheless, this statement was used only to justify the 
adoption of a reduced computational domain and this conclusion cannot be generalized. Moreover, 
the  possible  influence  of  building  aspect  ratio  can  be  interesting,  especially  in  densely  populated 
urban areas, such as the historical centre of European cities, where narrow and long street canyons 
are  often  bounded,  on  their  sides,  by  tall  and  thin  buildings.  An  example  of  the  heterogeneity  of 
urban morphometric parameters can be found in Badas et al. (2019), who performed an analysis of 
an  Italian  town;  the  resulting  distributions  of  planar  and  frontal  area  indexes,  which  are  strictly 
linked  to  both  canyon  and  building  aspect  ratio,  show  how  the  most  studied  squared  section 
building departs from real data. Hence, it would be extremely important, also for practical purposes, 
to assess whether and how the flow pattern and street ventilation are affected by the building aspect 
ratio.

In  the  present  study,  we  experimentally  investigate  the  flow  past  arrays  of  two-dimensional 
street canyons with the aim of elucidating the role of the building aspect ratio on the airflows within 
the  urban  canopy  and  the  overlaying  boundary  layer.  We  compare  the  typical  squared  section 
prismatic  buildings  with  the  flow  over  canyons  bounded  by  very  slender  buildings,  i.e.,  whose 
width is one tenth of their height. We describe the effects of the building aspect ratio in terms  of 
mean velocity field, turbulence statistics, and airflow exchanges. 

2 Experimental Set-up and Procedures 
Experiments were carried out in the recirculating water channel of the Hydraulics Laboratory at the 
University  of  Cagliari  sketched  in Fig.  1.  The  experimental  facility  and  measuring  techniques  are 
the same as those used by Garau et al. (2018). However, for the sake of clarity, we recall here the 
main  characteristics  of  the  set-up  and  procedures.  The  channel  (8.00-m  long,  0.40-m  wide,  and 
0.50-m high) is fed by a constant head reservoir (1); the flow rate was regulated by a sharp-crested 
weir  (2)  placed  at  the  end  section  of  the  channel;  at  the  initial  section,  a  honeycomb  grid  (3)

eliminated  any  secondary  flows.  The  measurement  area  was  located  6.15  m  downstream  of  the 
honeycomb, where an array of 20 prismatic buildings (4) spanning over the whole channel width, 
modelled  the  idealized  two-dimensional  urban  canopy.  Small  pebbles  (5-mm  average  size)  were 
irregularly  glued  on  the  portion  of  the  channel  bottom  between  the  honeycomb  and  the  building 
array  (5)  in  order  to  promote  the  rapid  development  of  a  turbulent  boundary  layer.  Two  street-
canyon aspect ratios were considered: the first, ARC = 1, corresponding to the flow regime described 
by  Oke  (1988)  as  skimming  flow,  and  the  second, ARC  =  2,  characterized  by  the  regime  of  wake 
interference, where ARC = D/H, D is the canyon width, and H is the building height (see Fig. 2).

centre of the investigated canyon 

For each canyon aspect ratio, two building shapes were considered. The first consisted of 20 × 
20 mm2 squared-section prisms; therefore the building aspect ratio, ARB, was equal to one, i.e., the 
shape  extensively  considered  in  literature  (Mo  and  Liu  2018;  Di  Bernardino  et  al.  2018).  The 
building aspect ratio, ARB, is here defined as the ratio of the building width, W, to the height, H (see 
Fig.  2).  The  second  series  of  prismatic  obstacles  had  a  2  × 20-mm2  section  resulting  in  an  aspect 
ratio ARB = 0.1, corresponding to very slender buildings. The measurement area was centred on the 
17th canyon, allowing the boundary layer to reach its equilibrium over the 16 canyons upstream of 
the  test  section  (Brown  et  al.  2000;  Llaguno-Munitxa  et  al.  2017;  Garau  et  al.  2018).  The 
characteristics  of  the  flow  upstream  of  the  obstacles  are  reported  in  Garau  et  al.  2018.  However, 
since  in  the  measurement  area  the  boundary  layer  is  fully  developed,  the  characteristics  of  the 
incoming flow coincide with those measured at the test canyon itself. All results are described in the 
reference  frame  drawn  in  Fig.  2,  with x  axis  orientated  streamwise,  the z  axis  vertically  upwards. 
Correspondingly, in the following, u and w indicates respectively the x and z velocity components. 

The  two  velocity  components,  u  and  w,  were  measured  using  a  non-intrusive  image-analysis 
technique.  The  vertical  midsection  of  the  channel  was  illuminated  by  a  light  sheet  (2-mm  thick) 
generated by a 532-nm diode laser, 2 W in power (6). A high-speed camera (1726 × 2240 pixel in 
resolution), placed orthogonally to the measurement plane (7), recorded 310 grey-scale images per 
second. The region framed by the camera was 0.10-m wide and 0.08-m high, resulting in a spatial 
resolution of 40 m per pixel. The water was uniformly seeded with pine pollen particles with an 
average diameter of 20 m, which are neutrally buoyant in water (Miozzi and Querzoli 1996). The 
velocity  field  was  obtained  by  means  of  a  feature  tracking  algorithm  that  analyzes  pairs  of 
successive frames in three main steps: firstly, the particle positions are identified on the first frame

Badas  MG,  Ferrari  S,  Garau  M,  et  al  (2019)  On  the  Flow  Past  an  Array  of  Two-Dimensional  Street  Canyons  Between  Slender 
Buildings. Boundary-Layer Meteorol. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-019-00484-x 

by means of the Harris algorithm (Harris and Stephens 1988). Secondly, the tracking is performed 
by comparing squared interrogation windows centred on the particles' locations to shifted windows 
on  the  successive  frame  and  looking  for  the  shift  minimizing  the  dissimilarity  between  windows. 
The  dissimilarity  was  measured  using  an  algorithm  based  on  the  Lorentzian  estimator,  averaged 
over the interrogation windows (in the present experiments, the window size was 19 × 19 pixels). 
Thirdly,  the  samples  were  validated  by  an  algorithm  based  on  a  Gaussian  filtering  of  first 
neighbours,  defined  by  the  Delaunay  triangulation.  The  method  is  robust  to  high  spatial  velocity 
gradients  and  appearance/disappearance  of  particles.  A  detailed  description  of  the  dissimilarity 
measurement  algorithm,  with  an  evaluation  of  the  performance  compared  to  the  classical  cross-
correlation  used  in  the  PIV  technique,  is  reported  by  Falchi  et  al.  (2006),  whereas  the  tracking 
procedure is described by Besalduch et al. (2013, 2014). 

For each canopy configuration we acquired a total of 48,000 frames at 310 Hz framerate, thus 
yielding 48,000 instantaneous velocity fields. With the aim of increasing the statistical robustness of 
the dataset, we divided the acquisition in N = 40 recordings of 1200 frames (i.e., lasting 3.9 s each) 
separated  by  a  time  interval  long  enough  for  the  acquisitions  to  be  statistically  independent. 
Statistics  on  a  regular  grid  (0.06  H  ×  0.06  H)  were  computed  by  considering  separately  all  the 
instantaneous  scattered  velocity  samples  that  fall  on  each  grid  cell.  A  statistical  convergence  test 
was performed by computing the mean and the variance of the streamwise velocity component in 
the  cell  centred  in  x  =  0.0  H  and  z  =  1.0  H  by  using  an  increasing  number,  n,  of  1200-frame 
recordings, and plotting the relative deviation from the value obtained with the whole dataset (i.e., n 
= N),

We  measured  an  average  of  830  velocities,  within  the  considered  grid-cell  area,  per  recording 
dataset.  Consequently,  the  total  number  of  samples  (within  the  cell)  exceeded  33500.  Results, 
presented  in  Fig.  3,  show  that  the  relative  deviation  remains  stably  below  3%,  provided  that  n 
exceeds 30 recordings, thus confirming the statistical robustness of the dataset.

During  the  present  experiments,  the  water  in  the  investigation  area  was  0.42-m  deep  and  the 
freestream velocity magnitude was U = 0.35 m s-1. The Reynolds number based on the freestream 
velocity  magnitude  and  the  building  height,  H,  resulted:  Re  =  UH/=  7,000.  Previous  tests, 
performed  on  the  flow  approaching  the  building  series,  revealed  that,  following  the  argument 
proposed  by  Uehara  et  al.  (2003),  only  a  1.0-mm-deep  layer  adjacent  to  the  wall is  affected  by  a 
significant decrease of the velocity because of the viscosity effects. Therefore, the bulk of the flow 
can be assumed Reynolds independent (Garau et al. 2018).

3 Results 
3.1 Mean Velocity 
Figure 4 shows the overall structure of the mean velocity field in the four investigated geometrical 
configurations  in  terms  of  non-dimensional  out-of-plane  vorticity,  H/U  (colour  maps),  and 
streamlines. The y-component of the vorticity,  was calculated by means of a centred difference 
scheme  applied  to  the  mean  velocity  field  on  the  regular  grid  described  in  the  previous  section. 
Irrespective of the building aspect ratio, when ARC = 1 (Figs. 4a  and 4c), the mean field shows the 
typical  features  of  the  skimming-flow  regime  (Oke  1988),  with  the  region  between  the  buildings 
dominated by a single clockwise vortex centred in the canyon. Similarly, in both the cases with ARC 
=  2,  the  flow  pattern  exhibits  the  typical  characteristics  of  the  same  flow  regime,  i.e.,  the  wake-
interference regime, which consists of a large clockwise vortex on the downwind side of the cavity 
and  a  smaller  counter-clockwise  vortex  at  the  lower  upwind  corner  of  the  canyon.  The  above 
observations  confirm,  as  expected,  that  the  aspect  ratio  of  the  prismatic  buildings  does  not  affect 
significantly  the  mean  flow  regime.  However,  at  a  closer  look,  some  differences  in  the  vorticity 
distribution can be identified.

In  the  skimming-flow  regime,  the  square  section  buildings  (ARB  =  1.0)  generate  a  continuous 
layer  of  high  negative  vorticity  along  the  whole  interface  between  the  canyon  and  the  overlaying

flow. In that region, the high vorticity corresponds to an intense shear layer. Differently, in the case 
of slender buildings (ARB = 0.1), the vorticity layer decreases rapidly from the roof of the upwind 
building, and it is almost undistinguishable in the downwind portion of the canyon interface, as a 
consequence  of  a  less  sharp  shear  layer  along  most  of  the  interface.  The  comparison  of  the  flow 
within  the  cavity  shows  higher  vorticity  levels both  at  the building  walls  and  in  the  centre  of  the 
main vortex compared to the case ARB = 1.0, indicating that the recirculation within the canyon is 
more intense when it is bounded by slender buildings. That stronger recirculation is an indication of 
a more efficient momentum transfer from the overlaying flow to the cavity, which in turn, following 
the argument by Bentham and Britter (2003), can be considered a clue of a higher exchange of air 
between the canyons and the outer flow, i.e., a better ventilation. The hypothesis will be confirmed 
by the further analysis presented below.

The differences are less pronounced in the wake-interference regime. At that canyon aspect ratio 
(ARC  =  2),  the  vorticity  at  the  upper  canyon  interface  is  less  intense  irrespective  of  the  building 
aspect  ratio,  suggesting  a  less  sharp  shear  layer  separating  the  cavity  flow  from  the  overlaying 
boundary layer. Consequently, the vorticity layer propagating from the roof of the upwind building 
vanishes  before  the  mid-width  of  the  canyon.  The  intensity  of  the  vorticity  layer  has  a  slightly 
higher intensity in the case of squared section buildings. Conversely, the intensity of the vorticity 
within the canyon is almost independent of the building aspect ratio.

3.2 Turbulence 
In order to elucidate how the building shape affects the generation of turbulence, the local value of 
the  non-dimensional  production  term  of  the  turbulence  kinetic  energy  budget  was  computed  and 
mapped  in  Fig.  5.  Since  the  measurement  plane  coincides  with  the  symmetry  mid-plane  of  the 
channel, the non-dimensional production term, P, reduces to:

As expected, most of turbulence production occurs at the shear layer which develops at the roof 
level.  In  further  detail,  the  region  of  turbulence  production  propagates, while  increasing  in  depth, 
from the upper corner of the upstream building. The production is weaker in the central zone of the 
interface, where the underlying mean flow is mainly horizontal, and increases in correspondence to

the zones where the  vertical  velocity  component dominates the cavity  flow.  With squared section 
buildings, the turbulence production has a small vertical extension, with some vertical spread only 
at  its  downstream  end,  particularly  in  wake-interference  regime.  Conversely  with  the  slender 
buildings,  in  addition  to  the  interfacial  layer,  the  turbulence  production  extends  over  the  region

Previous  measurements  pointed  out  that,  with  squared  section  buildings,  the  turbulence  in  the 
roughness  sublayer  (i.e.,  the  region  where  the  flow  is  influenced  by  the  individual  roughness 
elements) is more intense in the case of wake interference compared to skimming flow (Garau et al. 
2018). Colour maps shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate that the decrease of the building aspect ratio down 
to ARB = 0.1 does not alter this scenario. However, irrespective of the canyon aspect ratio, the flow 
above the canopy is meaningfully more turbulent when the canopy consists of slender buildings. In 
the skimming-flow regime the turbulence is always most confined out of the cavity. Differently, in 
the  wake-interference  regime  the  presence  of  slender  buildings  promotes  the  penetration  of  the 
turbulence over the entire region above the diagonal from the top of the leeward wall to the base of 
the windward wall; whereas, in the case of square buildings, the high turbulence zone extends only 
in the region just in front of the windward façade.

3.3 Vertical Profiles 
The maps presented above describe the phenomenon in all its spatial details. However, it is often 
useful  to  consider  the  canopy  as  a  whole,  leaving  out  the  effects  of  the  individual  roughness 
elements. For example, most of the urban canopy models that are available today assume spatially 
averaged  velocity  profiles  (Macdonald  et  al.  1998;  Kim  et  al.  2015;  Coceal  and  Belcher  2016). 
Following that approach, in this section we present the horizontal averages of the main quantities 
describing the mean flow and turbulence in the roughness sublayer. 

Following  the  canopy  approach  (Finnigan  2000),  we  computed  the  horizontal  average  over  a 

periodic canopy unit,

The  vertical  profiles  of  the  spatially-averaged  streamwise  velocity  component  (Fig.  7a),  〈𝑢(cid:3364)〉, 
collapse  on  a  single  curve,  irrespective  of  the  aspect  ratio  of  the  canyon  and  the  building.  Some 
differences  can  be  observed  for  0.8H  <  z  <  H,  i.e.,  at  the  shear  layer,  corresponding  to  the 
differences in the intensity of the shear layer observed also in the vorticity maps (Fig. 4). The slope 
of  the  profiles  in  that  region  confirms  that  the  velocity  gradient  generated  by  the  skimming-flow 
regime  (ARC  =  1)  is  higher  compared  to  the  gradient  generated  by  the  wake-interference  regime 
(ARC = 2). However, at a given canyon aspect ratio, the interfacial velocity gradient is higher when 
delimited by squared section buildings (ARB = 1.0). 

Above the building height the mean velocity exhibits different levels of velocity defect that, not 
surprisingly, are directly correlated to the values of the negative turbulent momentum flux attained 
in  the  region  just  above  the  canopy  (Fig.  7b).  In  fact,  wake  interference  gives  highest  values  of 
momentum flux, and higher velocity defect, compared to skimming flow (see e.g. Di Bernardino et 
al.,  2015)  and  the  presence  of  slender  buildings  enhances  momentum  fluxes  above  the  canopy 
compared to squared section buildings, at a given canyon aspect ratio. Additionally, Fig. 7b, shows 
that within the squared section canyon the turbulent momentum flux is slightly negative at the top 
of the canyon cavity and positive elsewhere inside the canyon, irrespective of the building shape, in 
agreement  with  the  findings  of  Di  Bernardino  et  al.  (2015)  and  works  referenced  therein.

Fig. 8  Non-dimensional variance  of  the streamwise  (panel  a)  and  vertical  (panel  b)  velocity  components  for  the  four 
configurations displayed in the legend 

In agreement with what is observed in the maps of turbulence kinetic energy shown in Fig. 6, 
the  streamwise  and  vertical  velocity  variance  profiles  also  are  significantly  influenced  by  the 
building aspect ratio. Some features are common to the variance of both the components: i) along 
the whole height of the roughness sublayer, the slender buildings tend to increase the variance for 
both  flow  regimes;  ii)  within  the  canyon,  the  effect  of  the  flow  regime  prevails  on  that  of  the 
building shape, and the variance of the cases corresponding to skimming flow are lower than those 
in wake-interference regime in accordance with other experiments performed with squared-section 
buildings (Kastner-Klein et al. 2001); iii) conversely, above the building height, the building shape

prevails, and the variance with slender buildings is significantly higher than in the case of squared 
section buildings, irrespective of the canyon aspect ratio. 

In  the  skimming-flow  regime,  the  streamwise  velocity  variance  is  a  maximum  at  z  =  H  for 
squared  section  buildings,  whereas  the  maximum  is  shifted  up  to  about  z  =  2.5H  with  slender 
buildings. Differently, in the wake-interference regime the maximum, although increased in value, 
remains  at  z  =  1.5H  when  ARB  is  decreased  from  1.0  down  to  0.1.  Within  the  canyon  all  the 
configurations show a similar behaviour. 

The vertical velocity variance is a maximum at about 2H with ARB = 1.0, while the maximum is 
located  at  z  =  2.2H  with  ARB  =  0.1.  In  the  wake-interference  regime,  the  region  of  high  vertical-
velocity  variance  protrudes  more  deeply  within  the  canyon  when  the  buildings  are  slender, 
indicating that the propagation of E within the cavity observed in Fig. 6b is mainly due to vertical 
velocity fluctuations.

horizontally  averaged  over  the  urban  periodic  unit,  which  can  be  interpreted  as  a  measure  of 
momentum  transport  efficiency.  Similarly  to  turbulence  kinetic  energy,  within  the  canyon,  the 
profiles  are  mainly  dependent  on  flow  regime,  whereas  above  the  building  height  the  values  are 
similar but the influence of building shape prevails. Above the canopy top, ruw is nearly constant for 
all the examined cases, and both the cases with slender buildings present higher values, witnessing 
more momentum transport per unit variance compared to the other conditions. In the cavity, in the 
presence  of  skimming  flow,  ruw  presents  positive  values  except  near  the  cavity  top,  whereas  in 
wake-interference regime ruw follows the same monotonical trend toward the axis origin. This trend 
resembles the family portrait of forest canopies studied by Böhm et al. (2013).

3.4 Exchange Flux 
The  vertical  air  exchanges  within  the  street  canyon,  and  especially  at  its  top,  are  crucial  for  the 
urban air quality since the capability of the flow to remove the pollutant released at the street level, 
for  instance  because  of  the  vehicular  emissions,  basically  depends  on  them.  There  are  different 
ways to estimate the exchange flux. All of them are based on integrating the velocity field over a 
given surface (usually the upper canyon interface) in order to compute the air flux. Some authors 
take into account only the mean velocity field (see e.g. Neophytou et al. 2014), while some others 
consider only the velocity fluctuations, under the assumption that the mean flow, due to the mass 
conservation, does not contribute to the air exchange (Liu et al. 2005). We followed the approach

based on the integration of the instantaneous velocity proposed by Weitbrecht et al. (2008) in the 
context  of  river  flows,  and  used  also  to  study  cavity  flows  (Tuna  et  al.  2013)  and  street  canyons 
(Perret et al. 2017). 

Let  (z)  be  the  horizontal  section  of  the  canyon  at  height  z.  We  compute  the  vertical  air

The  vertical  profiles  of  e  and  em,  made  non-dimensional  by  the  canyon  width,  D,  and  the 
freestream velocity, U, are presented in Fig. 10. The turbulent contribution may be inferred as the 
difference between e and em. The overall behaviour of the exchange flux is basically insensitive to 
the building shape, predominantly depending on the flow regime. In the SF regime, e and em are 
at a maximum at about mid canyon-height, where the vertical velocity dominates, and decrease both 
towards  the  ground  and  the  roof  level.  Conversely,  the  contribution  of  the  turbulence  attains  its 
higher values in the shear layer at the interface between the canyon and the overlaying boundary-
layer flow. Neophytou et al. (2014) computed the exchange flux based on mean velocity field in a 
similar  experimental  arrangement,  considering  two-dimensional  canyons  between  squared-section 
buildings at 0.5 < ARC < 2.33. The values are not quantitatively comparable, as far as they chose the 
bulk  velocity  through  the  flume  as  the  velocity  scale.  However,  they  found  values  at  roof  height 
about doubled in the case of ARC = 2 compared to the case of ARC = 1, whereas in our experiments 
em  is  about  the  same.  The  difference  can  be  explained  by  the  higher  velocity  defect  of  the 
horizontally  averaged  velocity  profiles  in the  case  of  wake  interference  with  respect  to  skimming 
flow (see Fig. 7a) which, in turn, corresponds to a decrease of the bulk-to-freestream velocity ratio.

roughness as reported in the legend 

As above mentioned, the higher velocity defect in Fig. 7a results from a more efficient vertical 
momentum transfer which is known to be related to an increased exchange flow rate (Bentham and 
Britter  2003).  Thus,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  increase  measured  by  Neophytou  et  al.  roughly

Badas  MG,  Ferrari  S,  Garau  M,  et  al  (2019)  On  the  Flow  Past  an  Array  of  Two-Dimensional  Street  Canyons  Between  Slender 
Buildings. Boundary-Layer Meteorol. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-019-00484-x 

corresponds  to  the  one  we  observed  in  terms  of  total  non-dimensional  exchange  flux  e/(UD). 
Perret  et  al.  (2017)  measured  the  exchange  flux  at  the  rooftop  height  in  different  canyon  and 
upstream  roughness  configurations,  including  ARB  =  ARC  =  1.0.  In  that  configuration  they  found 
e/(UD)  =  0.021,  quite  higher  compared  to  our  measurements  (e/(UD)  =  0.013).  However,  the 
turbulence in the canopy sublayer is known to depend on the characteristics of the upstream flow 
also  (Blackman  et  al.  2018).  A  comprehensive  summary  of  studies  on  flow  exchange  rate  is 
reported in Kubilay et al. (2017). Though it should be stressed that they are obtained with different 
methods, most of values reported are in reasonable agreement with the present results.  

In Sect. 3.1 we observed that the vertical transfer of momentum towards the canyon was more 
efficient  in  the  presence  of  slender  buildings,  in  particular  for  square-section  canyons,  and  we 
conjectured that  the  air exchange  would  be  as well.  The  plot  in  Fig.  10  confirms  the  speculation. 
Though  the  overall  behaviour  seems  to  be  insensitive  to  the  building  shape,  the  vertical  fluid 
exchange  is  enhanced  at  all  heights  in  the  presence  of  slender  buildings  in  the  skimming-flow 
regime, and mainly in the upper part of the canyon for the wake-interference regime. Comparison of 
e (solid lines) and em (dashed lines) shows that in all the analyzed configurations the contribution 
of  the  turbulence  is  increased  when  ARB  =  0.1.  However,  the  increase  of  the  contribution  of  the 
turbulence  to  the  ventilation  is  particularly  high  for  the  wake-interference  flow  regime,  thus 
compensating for the decrease of em observed for ARB = 0.1 and ARC = 2. 
3.5 Integral Time Scales 
In order to describe the time scale of the coherent structures dominating the roughness sublayer, we 
computed  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  1/e  time  scales  of  the  horizontal  (Tu)  and  vertical  (Tw) 
velocity over the periodic roughness unit. In every point of a regular grid (x = 0.04H, z = 0.1H), 
we computed the time auto-correlation coefficients of the two measured velocity components and 
estimated the 1/e time scale as the time lag when the correlation coefficient decreases to 1/e, which 
corresponds  to  the  integral  time  scale,  provided  that  the  autocorrelation  decreases  exponentially. 
Maps of horizontal, Tu, and vertical, Tw, 1/e scale are presented in Figs. 11−14, made dimensionless 
by the advective time H/U. 

The spatial distribution of Tu within the canyon (Figs. 11 and 12) is linked to the topology of the 
mean flow, thus, not particularly influenced by the building aspect ratio. Not surprisingly, regions 
of  high  values  are  found:  i)  where  the  flow  is  dominated  by  horizontal,  slow  motions;  ii)  at  the 
centre  of  the  main  recirculating  vortices;  iii)  at  the  interface  between  two  adjacent  vortices. 
However, excluding these regions, the 1/e scale within the canyon is lower compared to the region 
above the roof height. The presence of slender buildings tends to shorten the time scale, irrespective 
of  the  canyon  aspect ratio.  In  general,  the  upper  interface  of the  canyon  is  characterized  by  short 
time scales, indicating that the region is dominated by the small vortical structures generated by the 
shear layer. Conversely, in the case of wake-interference regime and ARB = 0.1 (Fig. 11b), relatively 
high values extend from the external flow to the centre of the main vortex, indicating that the region 
is dominated by the entrainment of external turbulent structures that, while propagating through the 
cavity, tend to preserve their time scale. 

Similar considerations can be drawn for the vertical velocity time scale, Tw (Figs. 13 and 14): 
the spatial distribution varies according to the topology of the flow, which in turn is mainly affected 
by the canyon aspect ratio. The three points illustrated above hold with the only difference that high 
values of Tw are found in the regions dominated by slow, vertical flow. It should be also noticed that 
the external flow exhibits always shorter vertical time scales, Tw, compared to the flow within the 
canyon.

Even in this case the presence of slender buildings has the effect of decreasing the peak values 

of 1/e time scale within the canyon both in the skimming-flow and wake-interference regime.  

Figure  15  shows  the  vertical  profiles  of  the  non-dimensional  1/e  time  scales  averaged 
horizontally over a periodic roughness unit. The analysis of the profiles confirms the main features 
yet  observed  in  Figs.  11−14.  <Tu>  is  a  maximum  at  z  =  0.1H  irrespective  of  the  aspect  ratios. 
Maximum  values  are  observed  in  the  wake-interference  regime.  However,  the  peak  value  is 
significantly decreased in the presence of slender buildings. The case of SF and ARB = 1.0 displays 
the  minimum  values  at  the  shear  layer  (z  ≈  H),  indicating  the  presence  of  a  sharp  shear  layer 
characterized by small structures that separates the cavity flow from the overlaying boundary layer 
in agreement with the findings of Blackman et al. (2015). In general, the slender buildings tend to 
increase the  horizontal velocity time scale at z = H, suggesting a shear layer  dominated by larger 
vortical structures, which are supposed to promote the mixing between the canyon and the external 
flow.

For both the  building  aspect ratios, above z ≈  1.4H the time  scale is mainly controlled  by the 
shape  of  the  canyon,  and  the  wake-interference  regime  gives  longer  time  scales  of  the  horizontal 
velocity compared to skimming flow (see also Table 1, reporting the values of the horizontal and 
vertical velocity time scale at z = 2.0H). The result is in agreement with the findings of Salizzoni et

The time scale of the vertical velocity component, Tw, is diminished within the canyon by the 
presence  of  slender  buildings  for  both  the  flow  regimes  (Fig.  15b).  In  that  case,  the  effect  of  the 
building shape prevails on that of the canyon aspect ratio. Therefore, the peaks attained with ARB = 
0.1 are lower compared to ARB = 1.0 regardless of the flow regime. In the roughness sublayer, at z = 
2.0H,  the  value  of  Tw  is  mainly  driven  by  the  building  shape  (Table  1)  and  the  time  scale  tends 
nearly to the same value irrespective of the canyon aspect ratio. The slender buildings generate the 
longest time scales. 

4 Discussion 
Results  show  that  when  the  street  canyon  is  delimited  by  slender  buildings,  significantly  higher 
production of turbulence kinetic energy is observed above the canopy (Fig. 5) giving rise to a higher 
level  of  turbulence  in  that  region  (Fig.  6).  Correspondingly,  the  shear  layer  separating  the  flow 
within  the  canyon  from  the  overlaying  roughness  sublayer  tends  to  be  smoother,  mainly  in  the 
downwind  portion  of  the  interface  (Figs.  4  and  7a),  and  it  is  characterized  by  longer  time  scales 
(Fig.  15).  The  higher  turbulence  intensity  corresponds  to  an  increased  vertical  flux  of  horizontal 
momentum (Fig. 7b).  

In  the  skimming-flow  regime  (ARC  =  1),  the  more  effective  momentum  transfer  from  the 
external flow to the vortex dominating the cavity in the case of slender buildings is witnessed also 
by the higher vorticity characterizing the cavity flow (Figs. 4a and 4c). 

In  the  wake-interference  flow  regime,  the  presence  of  slender  buildings  promotes  the 
entrainment of the turbulent structures from the roughness sublayer deep into the upper-downwind 
half of the canyon (Figs. 6b and 11b), in particular because of the increase of the vertical velocity 
fluctuations at the canyon interface and below (Fig. 8b).

The higher turbulence intensity and momentum flux significantly improve the ventilation at the 
intermediate  canyon  heights  in  the  case  of  SF.  Namely,  the  maximum  e  within  the  canyon  is 
increased  1.5  times  in  that  case  (Fig.  10),  thus  promoting  the  rapid  dispersion  of  the  pollutant 
released in the proximity of the street level. Conversely, in the case of WI regime, the increase of 
the turbulent contribution to the ventilation just compensates for the corresponding decrease of the 
contribution  of  the  mean  flow.  Finally,  slender  buildings  cause  a  significant  increase  of  the 
exchange  flux,  e,  at  the  interface  (z  =  H)  irrespective  of  the  flow  regime,  thus  improving  the

Salizzoni et al. (2009) investigated the mechanism driving the ventilation in a squared section 
canyon with two-dimensional roughness elements with different spacings upstream. They observed 
interface,  which  develops 
that  a  shear 
Kelvin−Helmholtz  instabilities  and  interacts  with  the  recirculating  flow  within  the  cavity  and  the 
coherent  structures  dominating  the  overlaying  boundary  layer.  Blackman  et  al.  (2018),  in  similar 
conditions, found evidence of non-linear interaction between the inclined large-scale structures of 
high  or  low  momentum  detected  in  the  boundary  layer  and  the  small  scales  close  to  the  canopy. 
This  scenario  is  confirmed  by  the  present  results.  The  region  of  high  values  of  the  production  of 
turbulence kinetic energy, P, shown at z = H with the squared section cavity and ARB = 1 (Fig. 5c), 
clearly indicates the presence of the above-mentioned shear layer, which develops from the upwind 
building vertex through the whole interface length, while getting unstable and increasing in depth. 
However,  for  the  same  cavity  geometry  but  with  slender  buildings  (Fig.  5a),  the  high  production 
region  developing  from  the  upwind  vertex  diffuses  rapidly  and  most  of  the  interface  is  not 
characterized by a clearly recognizable shear layer. The different development of the interface flow 
suggests a different mixing mechanism. 

In  order  to  elucidate  the  phenomena  driving  the  above-mentioned  change,  we  plotted  the 
instantaneous flow fields during typical sweep (Fig. 16) and ejection (Fig. 17) events. Inspection of 
Fig. 16c and 17c shows that, in the case of squared-section buildings, sweep and ejection events are 
due  to  the  flapping  of  the  interfacial  shear  layer,  which  however  preserves  its  coherence.  In  that 
case,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  mixing  at  the  interface  is  governed  by  the  shear-layer

instability, possibly triggered by the large-scale structures of the external boundary layer (Blackman 
et al. 2018) With slender buildings the sweep mechanism does not change (Fig. 16a); conversely, 
the  ejection  (Fig.  17a)  cannot  be  ascribed  to  a  flapping  motion  of  the  interface  but  it  is  the 
consequence of the upward motion along the upwind cavity wall. In that case, the mixing is driven 
by  the  dynamics  of  the  recirculating  flow  within  the  cavity,  which  in  turn  is  triggered  by  the 
downwards-momentum  injections  at  the  downwind  cavity  wall  which  occur  during  the  sweep 
events.

= 2 

The reason for the different behaviour is that, with squared-section obstacles, the horizontal, flat 
roof of the upstream building (which is 1.0H long) inhibits the vertical velocity fluctuations of the 
fluid generating the upper portion of the shear layer, which thus is subject to fewer perturbations. 
However,  this  effect  is  almost  completely  missing  with  slender  buildings  since  the  roof  length  is 
only  0.1  H.  Conversely,  the  vertical  perturbations  originating  from  the  upstream  canyon  can 
propagate towards the developing shear layer without obstacles. 

The  comparative  analysis  of  the  turbulence  production  maps  of  Fig.  5  and  the  instantaneous 
flow fields of Figs. 16 and 17 helps to understand the dynamics of the interface also in the case of 
WI. 

With  ARC  =  2  and  squared  section  buildings,  Fig.  5d  shows  a  shear  layer  that  starts  from  the 
upwind vertex and develops downwind for a length of about H. Further downstream, the turbulent 
production  is  weaker  and  spreads  up  to  1.4H  and  no  evidence  of  the  presence  of  a  well-defined 
shear layer is found. The instantaneous flow fields show that, during both the sweeps (Fig. 16d) and 
ejections (Fig. 17d), the flow within the cavity is basically separated from the external flow by the

shear layer from x = -1.0H to x = -0.1H (where mixing is governed by the shear layer dynamics). 
Conversely, in the downwind half of the interface, the external flow enters the cavity directly during 
the sweep events (triggered by the large-scale structures of the boundary layer), whereas ejections 
are driven by the vertical upwards motion of the large recirculating vortex. For slender buildings the 
scenario is not different but for the reduced length of the shear layer in the upwind portion of the 
interface (due to the missing of the vertical-velocity fluctuation inhibition by the flat roof, Figs. 6b, 
16b and 17b). As a consequence, the portion of the interface where the mixing is not mediated by 
the  shear  layer,  and  the  interaction  between  external  and  cavity  flow  is  direct,  is  larger,  thus 
producing a higher exchange flow. 

5 Conclusions 
With  the  purpose  of  investigating  the  effect  of  the  building  aspect  ratio  on  the  airflow  above  an 
urban canopy, we performed a series of experiments measuring the velocity field in the flow past 
canopies  of different  shapes.  We  focused  on  the  case  of  long  street  canyons  separated  by  slender 
buildings,  which  are  typical  of  the  densely  populated  urban  areas.  Since  our  aim  was  to  gather 
general  indications  about  the  phenomenon,  we  considered  idealized,  periodical,  two-dimensional 
canopies. We compared the classical squared-section two-dimensional roughness elements (ARB = 
1.0), to the limit case of reduced aspect ratio buildings (ARB = 0.1), both in the skimming-flow (ARC 
= 1) and wake-interference (ARC = 2) flow regime. 

Results  show  that  both  in  the  skimming-flow  and  wake-interference  regime,  the  presence  of 
slender  buildings  enhances  the  turbulence  in  the  overlaying  boundary  layer  and  the  canyon 
ventilation. The effect is more evident in the case of the skimming-flow regime. In particular, the 
analysis  of  the  vertical  profiles  of  the  spatially  averaged  quantities  shows  that  the  maximum 
horizontal velocity variance is increased by a factor of 1.7 in skimming-flow regime and by a factor 
of  1.4  in  the  wake-interference  regime.  Similarly,  the  maximum  vertical  velocity  variance  is 
increased  by  a  factor  of  2.1  with  skimming  flow  and  by  a  factor  of  1.5  in  the  wake-interference 
regime. 

The  combined  analysis  of  the  production  of  the  turbulence  kinetic  energy,  P,  and  some 
snapshots  of  the  flow  field  taken  during  sweep  and  ejection  events,  revealed  that,  with  slender 
buildings, the interfacial shear layer is more unstable, thus promoting a higher exchange flux at the 
rooftop level.  

The  increase  given  by  the  presence  of  slender  building  is  by  a  factor  2.0  in  the  regime  of 
skimming flow and a factor 1.3 in the regime of wake interference. The slender buildings yield also 
a significantly higher vertical fluid exchange within the canyon in the case of skimming flow (the 
maximum value is increased by a factor 1.5), whereas, in the wake-interference regime, the overall 
exchange  flow  remains  basically  unvaried  as  far  as  the  significant  increase  in  the  turbulence 
contribution provided by the slender buildings just compensates for the decrease of the contribution 
from  the  mean  motion.  In  conclusion,  though  a  parametric  study  would  be  required  to  explore 
quantitatively  the  change  in  the  ventilation  as  a  function  of  the  building  aspect  ratio,  the  present 
experiments  indicate  that  the  role  of  the  reduced  building  aspect  ratio  is  crucial  in  the  case  of 
narrow  street  canyons.  This  result  is  particularly  interesting  since  narrow  street  canyons  are 
typically delimited by slender buildings in the urban texture, for example, of the old European city 
centres.
