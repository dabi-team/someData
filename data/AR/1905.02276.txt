In this experiment, we measure ion temperature evolution of collisional plasma shocks and colliding
supersonic plasma ﬂows across a range of species (Ar, Kr, Xe, N), Mach numbers, and collisionalities.
Shocks are formed via the collision of discrete plasma jets relevant to plasma-jet-driven magneto-
inertial fusion (PJMIF). We observe nearly classical ion shock heating and ion-electron equilibration,
with peak temperatures attained consistent with collisional shock heating. We also observe cases
where this heating occurs in a smooth merged structure with reduced density gradients due to
signiﬁcant intepenetration of the plasma jets. In application to PJMIF liners, we ﬁnd that Mach
number degradation due to ion shock heating will likely not be signiﬁcant at the typical full-scale
conditions proposed, and that a degree of interpenetration may be an attractive condition for PJMIF
and similar approaches which seek to form uniform merged structures from discrete supersonic
plasma jets.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A shock wave is a dramatic and ubiquitous mechanism
by which the bulk kinetic energy of a supersonic ﬂow
is converted to other forms, which may include thermal
energy, energy of magnetic ﬁelds, and energy in acceler-
ated particles. Shocks that occur via plasma collective ef-
fects over length scales much shorter than the post-shock
collisional mean free path, termed collisionless shocks,
are an exciting frontier area of study in plasma physics,
with proposed relevance to the abundance of high en-
ergy particles and cosmic rays observed in the universe.
Collisional plasma shocks, occurring by way of Coulomb
collisions of the plasma charged particles, are perhaps
less exotic than their collisionless counterparts but still
contain rich physics. The structure of collisional plasma
shocks has been studied analytically [1] and a number
of features have been predicted, including ion heating in
excess of the local electron temperature, ion tempera-
ture relaxation via ion-electron collisional equilibration,
and the formation of self-consistent electric ﬁelds within
the shock thickness. In addition, when the energy den-
sity attained in the shocked region is high, radiative ef-
fects can become strong, plasma ionization and electrons
can strongly eﬀect transport, and a rich interplay of hot
plasma physics and supersonic hydrodynamics can ensue.
In recent years, with the increased development of high-
energy-density laboratory plasma facilities, some of the
these features of the collisional plasma shock can now be
more readily observed in the laboratory [2–5]. It is in-
teresting to ask the question if our theories of collisional

plasma shocks, having existed with minor modiﬁcation
for decades, are fully accurate and adequate to explain
the range of experiments that are now possible.

Our motivation and approach in studying collisional
plasma shocks is framed by research toward the develop-
ment of hypersonic spherically imploding plasma liners
as a novel driver architecture for the compression and
heating of magneto-inertial fusion [6–10] targets. This
architecture has been termed plasma-jet driven magneto-
inertial fusion, or PJMIF [11–13], and aims to form such a
spherically imploding liner via the merging of a spherical
array of discrete supersonic plasma jets. An important
metric for PJMIF liner performance is the time-averaged
liner Mach number, which must remain high for the liner
to eﬀectively compress a target at a substantial standoﬀ
distance. If collisional plasma shocks form when the dis-
crete plasma jets merge, this could elevate the liner ion
temperature, increase sound speed, and degrade the liner
Mach number, resulting in decreased performance of the
implosion [14, 15]. Plasma shocks may also cause non-
uniformities in the liner density, which may seed hydro-
dynamic instabilies in the later implosion phases. To ex-
perimentally investigate these ﬂows, plasma jet merging
experiments have been conducted on the Plasma Liner
Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory
over the past several years [16–20]. Recently, we have
performed experiments to measure the ion heating and
temperature evolution during the jet merging and colli-
sional plasma shock formation [21], which is the focus of
this paper, and to benchmark computer models of the jet
merging with six and seven jets, which will be discussed
in a separate publication [22].

The structure of this paper is the following:

in Sec-
tion II, an overview of the experimental setup is given,
Section III, procedures of diagnostic data reduction are

 
 
 
 
 
 
described, useful to inform the primary results of ion
temperature evolution, and in Section IV these results
are presented and discussed. In Section VI, implications
of the current results for the formation of PJMIF-scale
plasma liners are stated and the signiﬁcance of Mach
number degradation due to shock ion heating is assessed.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The PLX facility consists of a 9-ft diameter spherical
vacuum chamber that is equipped with six coaxial plasma
guns, which can be ﬁred in any permutation to produce
supersonic plasma jets that can be merged/collided at
the diﬀerent angles corresponding to the ports on the
chamber. In the current experiments, 2 guns are ﬁred at
a time producing plasma jets with nominal number den-
sities 1016 cm−3, temperatures ∼ 1.5 eV, and velocities
∼ 50 km/s.

Plasmas are formed in the guns via a gas-puﬀ injection
and preionization current pulse, and are accelerated by
a primary current discharge between coaxial electrodes.
While there initially exists a strong magnetic ﬁeld as-
sociated with the drive current, the plasma jets formed
in these experiments are dense and cool enough (∼ 1016
cm−3, ∼ few eV) that the characteristic time for the mag-
netic ﬁeld to decay is much less than the travel time be-
fore the jets collide. Hence in this experiment we assume
the jets to be unmagnetized.

Jet merging experiments are performed at diﬀerent
merging half-angles of 11.6◦ and 20.5◦, with diagnostic
data collected at multiple times and spatial positions
across repeated shots. Figure 1 shows framing camera
images of merging plasma jets at the diﬀerent angles,
with diagnostic locations overlaid. Experiments at both
angles are repeated for each of four diﬀerent gas species,
Ar, Kr, Xe, and N. A further overview of the PLX facility
in roughly the conﬁguration used for these experiments
is available in Ref. 20, the reader is referred there for
additional information, while we will describe here the
essential features and details of the current experiments.

III. DATA REDUCTION

Parameters important to the jet merging are the ion-
ion slowing length, ion-ion mean free path, and the rel-
ative velocity / Mach number in the shock direction.
These parameters depend on the plasma density, elec-
tron and ion temperatures, velocity, and ionization state,
which are inferred from multiple diagnostics. A summary
of the results is given in Table I, and more detail of the
separate measurements is given in the following sections.

ns exposure, false color, log of intensity) merging obliquely at

A. Plasma Jet Velocity

Plasma jet velocity is measured by analysis of the time
evolution of the light emission of the plasma jets as they
are ﬁred past a pair of pinholed plastic optical ﬁbers look-
ing perpendicular to each gun. Light is delivered via the
ﬁbers to silicon photodiodes and digitized at 100 MS/s.
The separation of each photodiode pair is 2 cm, which is
suﬃciently short to lead to unambiguous correlation of
the data traces in the majority of cases. By analysis of
the time separation of the two photodiode traces, the jet
velocity is deduced.

Multiple methods were tested and compared for auto-
matic processing of the photodiode signals to determine
the jet velocity. In all cases, the signals were normalized
to a common amplitude scale and smoothed by moving
average with a window of four samples, which drasti-
cally attenuated a systematic periodic noise present in
the raw data.
In the ﬁrst method, the leading signal
was time-shifted by an iterated amount and the corre-
lation with the second signal was computed. The time
shift corresponding to the jet velocity was determined
as the shift having resulted in maximum correlation of
the two signals. In the second method, the time diﬀer-

ences of ﬁrst crossings of a series of levels between 10%
and 90% of the maximum signal were computed, and the
time shift was determined as the median of these values.
For well-behaved signals these methods agreed closely,
however across the breadth of signals collected the sec-
ond method proved more robust as assessed by visible
inspection, and was thus used for determination of the
jet velocity. An example of the recorded, smoothed, and
time-shifted data (using the second method) is shown in
Figure 2.

shifted photodiode data for deduction of jet velocity of shot
1769. Time shift was found based on median time diﬀerence
between an array of levels spanning 10% - 90% of the leading
edge.

B. Post-merge Density

Line-integrated electron density of the post-merge /
post-shock plasma is measured using a multi-chord laser
interferometer [23]. For these experiments, ﬁve chords of
the interferometer are positioned transverse to the axis
of symmetry of the 6 jet mounting pattern on the cham-
ber.
Interferometer data are recorded at 40 MS/s and
smoothed by application of a 20-sample moving average.
The interferometer phase shifts observed are solely in the
positive direction, so we do not see evidence as was seen
in previous work of large preponderance of neutral species
in the jet trailing regions. This may be due to diﬀerences
in the gun designs used between the two experiments, and
also due to increased damping of the pulsed power system
present in these experiments decreasing the production
of colder trailing jets. An average post-shock electron

3

density is inferred using estimates of the plasma length
from lineouts of visible framing camera images. Averaged
interferometer data traces are shown in Figure 3 for the
varied gas species and merging angles. These data are
then combined with path length estimates from fram-
ing camera images to constrain the post-merge electron
number density.

One additional note from the time-resolved interfer-
ometer measurements is the observation of the length of
the jet after it has been traveled most of the way to the
center of the vacuum chamber.
It is seen that xenon
has similar or shorter overall jet length than the other
species, despite being ﬁred at a considerably lower ve-
locity. This is due to the heavier atomic weight of the
xenon atoms increasing the overall Mach number of the
jet, and spreading occurring more slowly at the decreased
sound speed. An important challenge for standoﬀ plasma
liners is to prevent expansion of the liner en route to en-
gagement with the target as has been shown in previous
work [15] – these results highlight the fact that using the
heaviest species possible for the liner is beneﬁcial in that
regard.

C. Post-merge Electron Temperature and
Ionization State

The electron temperature and ionization state of the
post merge plasma is constrained by analysis of broad-
band line-integrated visible emission spectra and com-
parison with steady-state NLTE atomic physics modeling
performed using the PrismSPECT software package [24].
Primarily, emission lines corresponding to singly-ionized
species of the plasma jet species are observed. Ultimately,
this analysis leads to the conclusion that post-merge elec-
tron temperatures remain in the range of a few eV and
average ionization states are not far in excess of unity.
Bounds for these plasma parameters are determined by
manually demarcating the region of best ﬁt. An example
of spectrometer data ﬁtting is shown in Figure 4, and
overall determined bounds are listed in Table I.

D.

Ion Temperature

The primary focus of this work is to measure the level
of ion heating that occurs in the jet merging and/or
collisional plasma shock formation. This measurement
is performed by analysis of the Doppler broadening of
the plasma emission lines. It is important in this study
to consider the possible eﬀects of alternative sources of
broadening, including Stark broadening and the eﬀects of
Doppler shift caused by the signiﬁcant plasma jet bulk ve-
locity. While Stark broadening is not expected to be sig-
niﬁcant in high Z species at these densities ∼ 1014 cm−3,
the supersonic jet bulk velocities are by deﬁnition signiﬁ-
cant. It was initially expected that the Doppler shift due
to the bulk jet velocities would be helpful in providing

an additional measure of the jet velocity – in practice,
the limited angles available for view produced signals
that were diﬃcult to interpret. The plasma was thus
observed from a view that was as near to normal to the
plane formed by the trajectories of the two guns as possi-
ble. The achieved view was estimated from the chamber
mechanical design to be within ∼ 2◦ of normal.

Since the plasma jet does not remain perfectly col-
limated as it travels towards the chamber center, but
rather expands, it is to be expected that some broadening

will be observed due to peripheral bulk plasma motion
towards and away from the spectrometer view. However
the parts of the plasma in motion are likely to be the least
dense and thus contribute only a small amount to the ra-
diation observed in the line-integrated spectrometer view
through the plasma, decreasing as the density squared.
Thus, no correction is made to the observed data for the
possibility of these bulk motions, from the reasoning that
corrections to data should be avoided when it is not cer-
tain that they are justiﬁed.

Figure 5 shows examples of recorded line shapes and
forward-ﬁt convolutions of Doppler-broadened line shape
and instrumental broadening. Figure 5(a) is representa-
tive of line shapes often recorded earlier in time in the
jet merging process, when ﬂat-topped and non-gaussian
shapes were often observed. Later in experimental time,
shapes came to resemble Figure 5(b), where the convo-
lution of instrumental broadening and Gaussian shape
ﬁt the data well. In generating the principle summary
ﬁgures (Figs. 7 - 8) from these data, a threshold of
goodness-of-ﬁt to the broadened Gaussian consisting of
the sum of squares of the ﬁtting residuals is employed,
such that shapes such as Figure 5(a) are indicated or ex-
cluded – such plots are thus focusing on the relatively
well-behaved data points where the plasma has assumed
a single temperature and absence of drastically divergent
bulk motions is inferred. More discussion of the tempo-
ral and spatial variance of lineshapes and their physical
interpretation is included in Section IV B.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Jet Structure

A qualitative but nonetheless valuable look at the jet
structure can be gained from analysis of framing camera
images of the jet merging. The majority of the images
taken in the experiment were from an angled and incom-
plete view making it hard to discern details of the shock
structure, but overall coarse insights can be gained from
analysis of images such as those of Fig 1. Fig. 6 shows a
comparison between argon jet mergers with signiﬁcantly
varied relative normal velocity, mainly due to the change
in merging half-angle from 11.6◦ to 20.5◦. We calculate

the ion mass normalized by the proton mass, and (cid:15) is
the ion directed energy associated with vcs. The factor
of 1/4 results from integration over the stopping trajec-
tory as the slowing rate varies with the particle speed
[25]. At the wider merging angle, the interpenetration
distance is greatly increased due to the 4th power eﬀect
in equation (1). The gradients observed in Fig. 6 shows
that indeed the sharpness of the merging layer becomes
greatly smoothed out when the interpenetration length
is signiﬁcantly greater than the mean free path. In this
way, collisional plasma shock formation cannot be said to
have occurred even though the merging velocities are su-
personic, due to the ﬁnite-Knudsen-number eﬀect of the
ion interpenetration.

Ion Temperature

Figure 7 shows ion temperatures inferred from Doppler
broadening in the case of Argon jets colliding at the shal-
low (11.6◦) merging half-angle, as a function of both spa-
tial position and experimental time. Associated plasma
parameters are given in Table I(a), indicating that the
merging should be fairly collisional and supersonic with
mean free path and interpenetration length being of simi-
lar order, a few cm. It is also indicated which data points
meet the goodness-of-ﬁt threshold and which do not. It
seen that at early times in the jet merging, line ﬁts are
often rejected and overall inferred temperatures are high.
As time progresses, line ﬁts become accurate and the ion
temperature assumes decreased values.

FIG. 5. Example raw Doppler broadening data. Data ac-
quired at early times in the jet merger often showed non-
Gaussian line shapes such as (a), while well into the jet colli-
sion curves tended to a Gaussian as shown in (b).

observed correspond to the leading / early part of the jet
merging, while the overall density is still quickly increas-
ing. These line shapes could thus be due to non-uniform
bulk velocities if the leading edges of the jets are mutu-
ally interpenetrating and scattering. More detailed char-
acterization of the velocity distribution evolution on the
initial merging is an attractive prospect for future work
– in the present data set we mainly resolve dynamics af-
ter the velocity has relaxed to a single Maxwellian, from
approximately 32 µs onward in this case.

Inspection of Figure 7 reveals that the ion tempera-
tures are more strongly dependent on time than spatial
location, indicative of relatively global heating and cool-
ing along the length of the oblique jet merger. Figure 8
shows the time evolution of measured post-shock ion tem-
peratures inferred via Doppler broadening for the varied
jet species and jet merging angles. The results are com-
pared to eq. (2), a result for the peak ion heating in a two-
ﬂuid treatment (electron and ion ﬂuids) of a collisional
plasma shock, if it is assumed that all kinetic energy goes
to ion heating (Ref. [21] supplemental material),

ulation results. However a study of the ﬁtting residuals
(cf. Fig. 7, Fig. 9) shows that these points were accepted
from experimental times with the high overall ﬁtting
residual, indicative of a relatively poor ﬁt, so it is likely
that these points are the remnants of the initial non-
Gaussian signatures of the merging. In other cases, the
simulation and theory results agree well with the data,
with the data sometimes attaining slightly greater tem-
peratures. Although this disagreement is often within
experimental uncertainty, we speculate that it may be
due to previously mentioned eﬀects of the imperfect col-
limation of the jets leading to additional broadening in
the observed line shape.

vided by the PROPACEOS code [31] [32]. Radiation
transport is modeled by a multi-group diﬀusion treat-
ment, with opacities also obtained from PROPACEOS
data, and is coupled to the plasma through a source term
in the electron energy equation.

Figure 10 (top left) shows the simulation setup for a
1D Cartesian merging simulation for a pair of Ar jets,
each with a peak ion density of 2.63 × 1014 cm−3, and a
(transverse) velocity of 8.36 km/s. Each jet is treated as
a separate ion ﬂuid species, which allows for interpene-
tration due to ﬁnite ion-ion collisional mean free paths
[33]. There is also a single electron ﬂuid species. The
initial jet temperatures are 1.5 eV for the electron and
both ion species. PIC implementation of ﬂuid model-
ing with a single electron and ion species is described in
some detail in Ref. [26], and the extension to allow for
multiple ion species is discussed in Ref. [27]. Radiation
transport is included in the single-group (gray) approx-
imation. For the density and temperature regimes in
this simulation study it is suﬃcient to assume a Spitzer
collision frequency [33] between charged-particle species.
A cell-size of 0.06 cm and timestep of 1.3 ps is used in
all simulation results shown. With these simulation pa-
rameters, we found negligible eﬀects due to numerical
diﬀusion when using the Eulerian remapping procedure
described above, so it is used throughout. Global energy
was tracked during the simulations and found to be con-
served to within a few percent in most cases. In the top
right of Fig. 10 we have plotted the ion density proﬁles
for each species at 2, 4, and 6 µs. Considerable jet inter-
penetration is visible, as is inferred in the experiments.
In the bottom right we have plotted the “eﬀective” single
ion temperature, Ti = (ni1Ti1 + ni2Ti2)/(ni1 + ni2), at
the same time increments. Fig. 11 shows the peak ion
temperatures as a function of time.

V. SIMULATION METHODOLOGY

We have used the plasma modeling code Chicago to
perform 1-D simulations of the transverse merging of jets
in order to compare the results to the measured ion tem-
peratures obtained from the two-gun experiments for Ar,
N, Kr, and Xe colliding jets (both from guns at 11.6◦ and
20.5◦ merging half angle). We have utilized the multi-
ﬂuid simulation capability of Chicago to perform these
simulations, in which Lagrangian macroparticles convect
ﬂuid attributes (momentum, temperature, internal en-
ergy, etc.)[28]. The ﬂuid momentum and energy equa-
tions, along with Maxwell’s equations are advanced on
the grid. This allows for solutions which are relatively
free of numerical diﬀusion and allows modeling with rel-
atively few particles per cell. Fluid particles may also be
remapped to the Eulerian grid [26], which allows for the
use of essentially a single particle/cell/species, at the ex-
pense of a somewhat more numerically diﬀusive solution.
A direct-implicit electromagnetic ﬁeld solve [29] allows
for timesteps which are large compared to the plasma
period, and a cloud-in-cell particle weighting scheme [30]
avoids numerical heating for cell sizes larger than the De-
bye length. Equation of state information (charge state,

in which rj0 is the initial jet radius, Rw is the cham-
ber wall radius, and N is the number of discrete jets
distributed around the sphere. With the density and rel-
ative velocity in hand, we can use equations (2) and (3)
to assess the peak temperature attained and the time
constant of subsequent cooling. Plugging in the velocity
vn along with sound speed corresponding to a nominal
pre-merge temperature, we obtain a peak ion tempera-
ture due to shock heating. Taking this temperature, and
density from (6), and plugging them in to equation (3),
we calculate the ion-electron relaxation time. Results are
given in Table II for two cases with initial liner kinetic
energy of 20 MJ, one with an implosion speed of 50 km/s
and one with 150 km/s. In the slower case (3), we see
that i-e equilibration is rapid in comparison to the liner
ﬂight time to the target (c.f.
line (I) Table II), so it is
clear that ion shock heating will not negatively impact
the overall liner Mach number in this case. The inter-
penetration length is much smaller than the jet footprint
on the merged liner (c.f. line (II) Table II), meaning that
the merging should be collisional and result in shock for-
mation.

It is interesting to consider whether the jet merging
could be accomplished in a similar collisionality regime to
the 20.5◦ Argon case (e) studied in this work, in which in-
terpenetration was observed to cause a relatively smooth
merger. Considering the faster case (4) of Table II at
150 km/s, we see that this is indeed likely possible given
the strong v4 dependence of interpenetration distance
on the jet relative velocity (c.f.
line (II) Table II). In
both MJ-scale cases, the number density is an order of

IMPLICATIONS FOR STANDOFF PLASMA

LINER FORMATION

Using the results of this investigation, speciﬁcally
the ion shock heating and equilibration results of sec-
tion IV B, we can assess the previously raised concern
of shock-heating-induced Mach number degradation of
plasma liners formed by the merging of supersonic plasma
jets. In the current experimental conditions, we do in-
deed observe substantial ion heating above the initial
temperature persisting for many microseconds, which
could be problematic if observed in a liner formation ex-
periment. We can use the equations (2) and (3), sup-
ported by these experiments, to assess the likely heating
for fusion-relevant liners. We can estimate the merging
radius Rm [15], local density nm, merging half-angle θ,
and normal velocity vn as the following:

magnitude higher than the current experiments. This
should increase the rate of radiative cooling relative to
electron heating via equilibration of shock-heated ions,
as the former should scale as n2 and the latter roughly
as n. Therefore one would not expect an elevation in the
plasma ionization state to cause a transition to collisional
shock formation, as has been observed in e.g. Ref. 18.

From this we ﬁrst conclude that Mach number degra-
dation due to ion shock heating should not be a signif-
icant eﬀect to MJ-scale plasma liners at their currently
envisioned velocities of order 50 km/s. We also note the
intriguing possibility of a high-velocity jet merger oper-
ating in a somewhat interpenetrating regime, which may
oﬀer improved uniformity and symmetry of the merged
plasma liner over the shock-forming case.

with an overall smoother merged structure with reduced
density gradients. This structure is eﬀectively a super-
sonic mutual collisional stopping similar to a collisional
plasma shock, but occurring on the length scale of the
ion interpenetration length and precluding the formation
of abrupt density jumps on the order of the mean free
path. In application to PJMIF liners, we ﬁnd that Mach
number degradation due to ion shock heating will likely
not be signiﬁcant at the typical full-scale conditions pro-
posed.
In addition, the smoothness of the jet merger
and decrease in density gradients observed in interpene-
trating cases may make them an attractive candidate for
approaches such as PJMIF which seek to form smooth
and uniform structures from the merging of discrete su-
personic plasma sources.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In conclusion, we observe nearly classical ion shock
heating and ion-electron equilibration across a range of
species, Mach numbers, and collisionalities. In particular
it is interesting to observe the diﬀerences and similarities
between the jet mergers with interpenetration length of
order of the mean free path, and in mergers with in-
terpenetration length an order of magnitude higher. In
such cases we see similar peak temperatures attained, but
