Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering was ﬁrst experimentally estab-
lished ﬁve years ago by the COHERENT experiment using neutrinos from the spallation
neutron source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The ﬁrst evidence of observation of
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering with reactor antineutrinos has now been re-
ported by the Dresden-II reactor experiment, using a germanium detector. In this paper,
we present constraints on a variety of beyond the Standard Model scenarios using the
new Dresden-II data. In particular, we explore the constraints imposed on neutrino non-
standard interactions, neutrino magnetic moments, and several models with light scalar or
light vector mediators. We also quantify the impact of their combination with COHER-
ENT (CsI and Ar) data. In doing so, we highlight the synergies between spallation neutron
source and nuclear reactor experiments regarding beyond the Standard Model searches, as
well as the advantages of combining data obtained with diﬀerent nuclear targets. We also
study the possible signal from beyond the Standard Model scenarios due to elastic scattering
oﬀ electrons (which would pass selection cuts of the COHERENT CsI and the Dresden-II
experiments) and ﬁnd more stringent constraints in certain parts of the parameter space
than those obtained considering coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering.

1 Introduction

Low-energy neutrinos can elastically scatter oﬀ atomic nuclei via weak neutral currents,
with the initial and ﬁnal states of the nucleus being indistinguishable. For low enough
momentum transfers, the interaction takes place coherently with the whole nucleus, leading
to an enhancement of the cross section approximately proportional to the square of its
number of neutrons. Although the so-called coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEνNS) was ﬁrst theoretically described in Freedman’s seminal paper almost 50 years
ago [1], its detection has not been possible until very recently. This is so because the single
observable for this process is a recoiling nucleus which generates a signal in the sub-keV to
few keV energy range, diﬃcult to detect. An additional hindrance to CEνNS detection is
the limited number of suitable neutrino sources, which must be suﬃciently intense in yield
and, at the same time, low enough in neutrino energy for the coherence condition to be
satisﬁed.

The detection of CEνNS was experimentally demonstrated by the COHERENT ex-
periment [2] using the currently most intense spallation neutron source (SNS), sited at

– 1 –

the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S.A. The original observation was obtained with a
CsI[Na] scintillation detector [2, 3], which was later followed by the observation of CEνNS
at a liquid Argon detector [4, 5].

In addition to spallation sources, CEνNS is also searched for in a variety of exper-
iments using electron antineutrinos emitted by nuclear reactors, such as TEXONO [6],
νGeN [7], CONNIE [8], MINER [9], Ricochet [10], ν-cleus [11], RED-100 [12], NEON [13],
CONUS [14] and NCC-1701 at Dresden-II [15]. At present, most of these reactor experi-
ments have not yet been successful in the CEνNS detection. The exception to this is the
NCC-1701 experiment at the Dresden-II nuclear reactor. In their ﬁrst published data [15],
the experimental collaboration presented an event spectrum with an excess of events at
low energies, compatible with expectations from a CEνNS signal in the Standard Model
(SM). Recently, the collaboration has released new results with an increased exposure. The
observation of CEνNS is reported with strong to very strong preference (with respect to the
only-background hypothesis) in the Bayesian statistics sense, depending on the quenching
factor considered [16].

A precision measurement of CEνNS provides a direct probe to both SM and beyond
the standard model (BSM) physics. Paradigmatic examples of the former are the deter-
mination of the weak mixing angle at very low momentum transfer [17–22] and the study
of nuclear structure [22–26]. The program of BSM exploration with CEνNS is broad (see,
e.g., refs. [20, 27–75] for an incomplete list) being most sensitive to a variety of scenarios
leading to modiﬁed neutrino interactions with nuclei – in particular at low momentum
transfer – but extending also to the production of new light neutral states, and sterile
neutrino searches, among others.

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst analysis using the new data of the Dresden-II reactor
experiment in the context of BSM searches. In doing so, we consider several new physics
scenarios commonly studied in the literature: eﬀective four-fermion interactions, neutrino
magnetic moments, and light mediators. In order to place our results in a broader context,
we also combine the Dresden-II data with a germanium detector with the COHERENT
data obtained for neutrino scattering oﬀ CsI and Ar. We highlight and quantify the syn-
ergies between SNS and reactor experiments using CEνNS, as well as the advantages of
the combination of data sets obtained with multiple nuclear targets. Furthermore, we also
study a potential signal from BSM scenarios due to elastic electron scattering (ES). Al-
though in the SM this contribution to the event rates is negligible, it could be signiﬁcantly
enhanced in the presence of new physics eﬀects. The contribution from scattering oﬀ elec-
trons could pass selection cuts of both COHERENT CsI and Dresden-II experiments and,
as we discuss, its inclusion leads to stronger constraints in certain parts of the parameter
space than those obtained using CEνNS.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the theoretical frameworks
we consider. Section 3 discusses the computation of the expected event rates and the details
regarding our ﬁt to the experimental data, while the results of our analysis are presented
in section 4. Finally, we summarize and conclude in section 5, and provide the binding
energies for neutrino scattering oﬀ electrons in appendix A.

2 Phenomenological frameworks

Let us start by introducing the diﬀerential cross sections for both CEνNS and ES in the
SM. The SM diﬀerential coherent elastic scattering cross section, for a neutrino with energy
Eν scattering oﬀ a nucleus of mass mA, is given1 by [1, 76]

(2.1)

where GF is the Fermi constant, ER is the nuclear (kinetic) recoil energy, and the weak
hypercharge of the nucleus in the SM is QW = (N gV,n + Z gV,p), where N and Z are
its number of neutrons and protons, respectively. The weak charges of the neutron and
the proton are gV,n = −1/2 and gV,p = 1/2 − 2 sin2 θW , with sin2 θW = 0.23868 at zero
momentum transfer [77, 78]. For Ge we use {N, Z} = {40.71, 32} (weighted average
of natural isotopic abundances), while for CsI we use {N, Z} = {76, 54} and for Ar,
{N, Z} = {22, 18}.

In eq. (2.1) above, the nuclear form factor F (q) is assumed to be equal for protons
and neutrons. Some commonly used phenomenological parameterizations are the Klein-
Nystrand [79] or the Helm [80] form factors, among others. Note that, at the energies of
interest for the Dresden-II experiment, F (q) (cid:39) 1, so the choice of form factor is completely
irrelevant. For COHERENT, we use two diﬀerent form factors, depending on the target
nucleus. For CsI, we use the theoretical calculation from refs. [81] (based on refs. [82, 83]),
n(cid:105) = −0.1161 fm2 and
while for Ar we assume a Helm form factor with s = 0.9 fm, (cid:104)r2
p(cid:105) = 0.70706 fm2 [84], Rch = 3.4274 fm [85] and Rn,pt = 3.405 fm [86] (following the
(cid:104)r2
same notation as in ref. [26]).

The diﬀerential cross section for ES per atom within the SM can be expressed as (see,

e.g., refs. [87, 88])

where Te stands for electron (kinetic) recoil energy. The eﬀective electron couplings cV
and cA contain the contributions from the SM neutral current (NC), which are equal for
all ﬂavors, plus the charged-current (CC) contribution which only aﬀects ¯νee− and νee−
scattering. For convenience, their values are given in table 1.

1This strictly applies to J = 1/2 nuclei [76]. Note that for J = 0 nuclei the last term is not present [1],

although its contribution is negligible for the energies of interest.

– 3 –

We assume that scattering oﬀ electrons is incoherent, so the total ES cross section per
atom is obtained by multiplying the ES cross section per electron by an eﬀective charge,
eﬀ (Te), where X ≡A
ZX
Z X indicates the target nucleus. This takes into account that, in
this process, atomic binding eﬀects have to be considered for recoil energies comparable to
atomic binding energies. In doing so, we follow the procedure proposed in refs. [89? ? ]
and assume ZX
eﬀ (Te) to be a step function of the binding energies of the diﬀerent atomic
levels, as provided in appendix A.

Finally, both types of interactions (oﬀ nuclei and oﬀ electrons) are two-body elastic
scattering processes, so the kinematics is the same. Hence, the minimum neutrino energy
T 2 + 2 m T
/2 and the maximum
to produce a recoil with energy T is Eν,min =
recoil energy for a given neutrino energy is Tmax = 2 E2
ν /(2 Eν + m), where T ≡ ER and
m ≡ mA for nuclei, while T ≡ Te and m ≡ me for electrons.

Throughout this work we will consider several phenomenological scenarios leading to
modiﬁcations to the interaction cross sections in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), as explained in more
detail below.

2.1 Non-standard neutrino interactions

The so-called non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) framework consists on the addition
of four-fermion eﬀective operators to the SM Lagrangian at low energies. For example, the
eﬀective Lagrangian

would lead to new NC interactions with the rest of the SM fermions. Here, α, β ≡ e, µ, τ
while f refers to SM fermions, and P can be either a left-handed or a right-handed pro-
jection operator (PL or PR, respectively). Such new interactions may induce lepton ﬂavor-
changing processes (if α (cid:54)= β), or may lead to a modiﬁed interaction rate with respect to
the SM result (if α = β).

In presence of NC NSI, the eﬀective charge of the nucleus in eq. (2.1) gets modiﬁed,

(2.6)

The ﬁrst consequence we observe of the inclusion of NSI eﬀects is that the weak charge
may now depend on the incident neutrino ﬂavor α. As will be discussed below, it is relevant
to note that the COHERENT experiment observes interactions of both electron and muon
neutrinos. However, at ﬁrst approximation, it measures the linear combination Q2
e + 2 Q2
µ
and hence, both charges are degenerate: a reduction in the value of Q2
e can be compensated
by an increase in Q2
µ and vice versa. At COHERENT, though, the addition of timing infor-
mation partially breaks this degeneracy for CsI, as discussed in detail in ref. [44]. Including
reactor data, which is only sensitive to interactions with electron antineutrinos, brings in
additional complementary information in this respect [40]. It provides an additional con-
straint on Q2

e, which is independent of Q2
µ.

The second relevant feature we observe from eqs. (2.4)-(2.6) is that the impact of NSI
on the weak charge depends on the values of N and Z in a non-trivial manner. Because
of this, the combination of data obtained for diﬀerent nuclei oﬀers an additional handle to
reduce the size of the allowed conﬁdence regions of this scenario (for earlier discussions see,
e.g., refs. [27, 33, 57, 90]).

2.2 Neutrino magnetic moment

In the presence of a neutrino magnetic moment, µν, the cross sections for neutrino scattering
oﬀ nuclei and electrons get additional contributions which do not interfere with the SM
ones. The scattering oﬀ protons can be considered coherent and therefore its cross section
is given, up to order O((ER/Eν)2, ER/mA), by [87]

where the form factor F (q) is assumed to be the same as in the SM, which is a reasonable

Conversely, the scattering oﬀ electrons is incoherent and therefore, the cross section in

this case, up to order O((Te/Eν)2), is [87]

(2.8)

Notice that, in writing eqs. (2.7) and (2.8), we have denoted the neutrino magnetic moment
as µν, without specifying the ﬂavor of the neutrino. However, neutrino magnetic moments
arise in a variety of models of new physics and, in particular, they do not need to be
ﬂavor-universal. Therefore, in what follows, we will allow diﬀerent magnetic moments for
the diﬀerent neutrino ﬂavors, reporting their bounds separately.

In order to quantify the contribution of the scattering oﬀ electrons, in section 4 we study
the constraints on two speciﬁc models: a ﬁrst one in which the scalar couples universally to
all relevant fermions (hereafter referred to as universal ), and another one in which it only
couples to leptons (dubbed leptonic scalar model). For convenience, table 2 summarizes
the explicit values of charges considered for the diﬀerent SM fermions.

2This is an approximate expression, which actually does not coincide with any of the sets of values in
ref. [94] (for updated values of the coeﬃcients, see ref. [95]). We use it for the sake of comparison with the
results from refs. [31, 68]. Current uncertainties on the low-energy coeﬃcients and masses lead to variations
of 20%-30% in eq. (2.11); we have numerically checked that this leads to a (cid:46) 10% eﬀect on our constraints.

which it only couples to electron ﬂavor (Le), and the anomaly-free ﬂavor-universal model
with coupling to B − L (see table 2).

3 Data analysis

In this section we describe the procedure we follow to perform the data analysis of the
Dresden-II and COHERENT data.

3.1 The Dresden-II reactor experiment

We use a sample with 96.4-day exposure of a 2.924 kg ultra-low noise p-type point contact
(PPC) germanium detector (NCC-1701) to the high ﬂux of electron antineutrinos from
the Dresden-II boiling water reactor (BWR). The new data set spans the period between
January 22 and May 8, 2021, when the reactor was operated at its full nominal power
of 2.96 GW. In the data release [16], which we follow closely, the data points and errors
are provided in the form of rate per day. The errors (per day) represent a combination of
statistical and signal acceptance uncertainties. With the new information obtained from

– 7 –

the reactor operator, the improved center-to-center eﬀective distance between the PPC
crystal and the center point of the BWR core is 10.39 m. The estimate of the ¯νe ﬂux
from the reactor is 4.8 × 1013 ¯νe/cm2s with a ∼ 2% uncertainty [96, 97]. We describe the
reactor ¯νe spectrum using the typical average values of ﬁssion fractions of the four main
isotopes (making up more than 99% of all reactor neutrinos), for commercial power reactor
using low-enriched uranium: 235U (58%), 239Pu (29%), 238U (8%) and 241Pu (5%) [98].
We use the combination of the tabulated spectra for E¯νe < 2 MeV from ref. [87] and for
2 MeV ≤ E¯νe ≤ 8 MeV from ref. [97]. We set the ﬂux to zero beyond the maximum energy
that is tabulated.

The background model consists of four components [16], although only two of them re-
ally contribute to the SM signal region. The other two allow constraining these components.
The dominant source in the signal region is the elastic scattering of epithermal neutrons,
which is modeled by a free exponential plus a free constant term, Repith+Aepith e−Erec/Eepith,
where Erec is the reconstructed ionization energy. The other three components of the back-
ground consist of electron capture (EC) peaks in 71Ge, which are all described as Gaussian
probability density functions (PDF) with three free parameters: the amplitude Ashell, the
centroid Eshell, and the standard deviation σshell. The M -shell EC peak is constrained by
the L1-shell EC peak, with parameters {AL1, EL1, σL1}. Although the L1-shell peak is at
a nominal energy of 1.297 keV, it is also allowed to vary freely. The ratio of the amplitudes
of the L1-shell and M -shell has been experimentally determined to be 0.16 ± 0.03 [99],
so following the data release [16], we model this ratio with a Gaussian prior of width
σM/L1 = 0.03 and centered at AM /AL1 = 0.16, which we add to the likelihood. The cen-
troid of the M -shell EC contribution is ﬁxed at EM = 0.158 keV [99, 100] and the standard
deviation is set to be equal to the electronic noise σM = σn, which is 68.5 eV during the
96.4 days of reactor operation (Rx-ON) and 65.25 eV during the 25 days of reactor refuel-
ing outage (Rx-OFF). Finally, the last contribution comes from the L2-shell EC, with the
amplitude ﬁxed by AL2/AL1 = 0.008, the centroid at EL2 = 1.142 keV and the standard
deviation σL2 = σL1. Explicitly, the background model, in terms of the reconstructed
ionization energy, Erec, is described by a diﬀerential rate

corresponds to a minimum average ionization energy, EI,min (cid:39) 2.98 eV, required to produce
a hole-pair in germanium (at 77 K) [101] (see ref. [102] for a compilation of existing data
at other temperatures). The ionization energy is deﬁned as EI = Q(ER) ER, with Q(ER)
being the quenching factor, which describes the reduction in ionization yield of a nuclear
recoil when compared to an electron recoil of same energy. We consider two models from
the data release, which are not in tension with CONUS data [14], and are denoted by ‘Fef’
(using iron-ﬁltered monochromatic neutrons) and ‘YBe’ (based on photoneutron source
measurements) [103]. The spread between these two models approximately represents the
uncertainty on this parameter. Note that the cross sections in eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) diverge
as the recoil energy goes to zero. Consequently, the contribution arising from the scattering
due to the neutrino magnetic moment (and similarly for models with very light mediators)
is larger in the lower energy bins, a contribution that can be divergently large under the
assumption that asymptotically low ionization energies could trigger the detector. This
unphysical behavior is cut-oﬀ by the physical requirement of the average energy required
to produce an electron-hole pair. Thus, in what follows, we impose EI,min = 3 eV when
evaluating the expected rate of events.

The energy resolution function, R(Erec, EI ; σI ), is described as a truncated Gaussian

(Rx-OFF), η is the average energy of electron-hole formation and F is the Fano factor. For
Ge, η = 2.96 eV and F = 0.11 [16]. The prefactor with the error function is included to
guarantee the resolution function is normalized to 1 for EI > 0. Note that, although the
reconstructed energy ROI is Erec = [0.2, 1.5] keV, events with EI < 0.2 keV are assumed
to trigger the detector and be susceptible of ﬁltering into the ROI.

Moreover, it is important to point out that, as provided, all data points are already cor-
rected for signal acceptance, so this must not be included in the calculation of the expected
signal rate. Ideally, raw data and signal acceptance as a function of the true ionization
energy, EI , must be used. In this way, the signal acceptance must be included in eq. (3.2).
Nevertheless, the approach used here, following the data release, has a negligible impact on
signals that grow slowly at small ionization energies, as the SM or NSI cases. Yet, it could
have a non-negligible eﬀect on the event rate in models with a large neutrino magnetic
moment or in the presence of light mediators (in the case of interactions with nucleons).
Furthermore, the impact of using signal acceptance-corrected data also depends on the
minimum ionization energy capable of triggering the detector. Note that the minimum
ionization energy at which the signal acceptance is currently measured is 0.13 keV [16].

In general, when considering diﬀerent new physics scenarios, the signal rate depends

on a set of (one or two in this work) parameters θ. We use the following χ2,

of events in the exposure time) in bin i, which combines statistical and signal acceptance
uncertainties, and βM/L1 is the ratio between the amplitudes of the M -shell and L1-shell
EC contributions to the background, with central value AM /AL1 = 0.16 and σM/L1 = 0.03.
We do not include additional nuisance parameters. Nevertheless, we have checked that even
adding a 10% uncertainty on the normalization of the signal, the results are only aﬀected at
the percent level. Finally, in order to study the sensitivity to the new physics parameters,
we proﬁle the above likelihood,

In ﬁgure 1 we show the predicted event distributions for the SM and for the mod-
els of new physics we consider. Along with these spectra, we also include the Dresden-II
data points, after subtracting the best-ﬁt background model assuming only the SM signal.
In the left panel of ﬁgure 1 we show the predicted event distributions for the SM and the
extra contribution from a non-zero magnetic moment. We see that the µνe-induced electro-
magnetic scattering oﬀ protons dominates over the corresponding scattering oﬀ electrons
for Erec (cid:46) 0.35 keV. This is so because the coherent cross section oﬀ nuclei is enhanced
by the factor Z2/ZGe
eﬀ , which is large enough to compensate the suppression due to the
quenching factor (which makes the characteristic 1/ER of the nucleus smaller than 1/Te of
the electron, for the same value of Erec). Also, from eqs. (2.10), (2.12), (2.14) and (2.15)
we expect diﬀerent spectra of events for interactions mediated by light scalars or by light
vectors, as well as a diﬀerent scaling with energy for scattering oﬀ electrons and oﬀ nu-
cleus. This can be seen from the comparison among the diﬀerent curves in the right panel
of ﬁgure 1, where we have assumed universal couplings (see table 2). The event spectra
for interactions mediated by a massless scalar are very similar to the µνe-induced ones, as
they are governed by the 1/ER or 1/Te dependence for CEνNS or ES, respectively. In this
case, the coherent cross section oﬀ nuclei is enhanced by the factor Q2
eﬀ with respect to
that of scattering oﬀ electrons. On the other hand, the event spectra for ES mediated by
a massless vector is much larger than the one for scattering oﬀ nuclei. Unlike the cases of
the magnetic moment or the scalar mediator, the dominant contribution at small energies
for CEνNS is a factor ∼ me/mA smaller than for ES.

subtracting the best-ﬁt background model assuming only the SM signal. All results in both panels
are depicted for the Fef model of the quenching factor (for interactions with nuclei) and assuming
EI,min = 3 eV.

3.2 The COHERENT experiment

For the COHERENT CsI analysis, we follow the same procedure as in ref. [44]. We use
the nuclear form factor from ref. [81], we estimate the time dependence of the background
directly from anti-coincidence data, and for concreteness, we use the quenching factor from
ref. [104]. In the present work we also include scattering oﬀ electrons. In this case, there
is no quenching factor, the target mass is set to the electron mass, and we use an eﬀective
number of electrons per nucleus, Zeﬀ (Te), as provided in appendix A (see also section 2).
The rest of the details of the analysis are the same as in ref. [44]. Here, the minimum recoil
energy considered can be safely set to zero, since the eﬃciency vanishes at low energies.

For the analysis of Ar data, we follow the oﬃcial data release [5]. In this case we do not
include scattering oﬀ electrons, as the experiment can discriminate nuclear from electron
recoils [4]. To obtain the CEνNS event spectrum, we start by computing the signal event
spectrum in nuclear recoil energy, ER, which is given by

constant N given by

N =

(3.8)

where (cid:96) = 27.5 m is the distance to the detector; NPoT = 13.77 × 1022 is the number of
protons on target (PoT), corresponding to an integrated power of 6.12 GW·hr; fπ/p = 0.09
is the number of pions produced per PoT; and NAr = mdet/mAr is the number of nuclei in
the detector, with mdet = 24.4 kg the detector mass and mAr the 40Ar mass.

However, the experimental collaboration does not bin their data in nuclear recoil energy
(keVnr), but in electron-equivalent recoil energy instead (keVee). In addition, we have to
account for the detection eﬃciency, (cid:15), and the energy resolution. Introducing these eﬀects,
the expected event rate in each bin i (of width ∆Erec) is computed as:

accounts for the energy resolution of the detector:

(3.10)

with a width σI ≡ σ(EI ) = 0.58 keV (cid:112)EI /keV, as prescribed in the data release. As the
energies in the ROI are much larger than the standard deviation, this deﬁnition, unlike
eq. (3.3), does not require the extra factor to guarantee it is correctly normalized to 1.
Also, note that in eq. (3.9) the detection eﬃciency (cid:15) is obtained post-triggering and it is a
function of the reconstructed energy (and not of the true energy).3

We set the minimum nuclear recoil energy to EI,min = 19.5 eV, the average energy
to produce a scintillation photon in Ar [105]. As indicated above, the relation between
EI and ER is given by the quenching factor, EI = Q(ER) ER, which is described as
Q(ER) = a + b ER, with a = 0.246 and b = 0.00078 keV−1, as given in the data release.

Following the procedure above, we obtain a nominal prediction of 135.3 signal events.
This is slightly higher than the rates predicted by the collaboration, but well within their
reported error bars (their nominal prediction is 128 ± 17 events). Our spectrum also shows
good agreement with the oﬃcial one.

To further reduce backgrounds, the analysis includes information not only on recoil
energy, but also on timing and on the fraction of integrated amplitude within the ﬁrst 90 ns
(this last variable is called F90 by the collaboration). Once we compute the distribution
in recoil energy as described above, we can obtain the full 3D PDF. We do so by rescaling

3Furthermore, contrary to the indications provided in the data release, in our analysis we include this
eﬃciency as a function of reconstructed energy before binning the event distribution, as otherwise we do not
ﬁnd good agreement with the results of the collaboration.

where PDFi,j,k stands for the predicted PDF provided by the collaboration as a function

of systematics.

Finally, we include systematic uncertainties by adding nuisance parameters as pre-
scribed in the data release.4 For each nuisance parameter, we add a pull term to either the
signal or background prediction as

ni,j,k = ¯ni,j,k (1 + ξ σi,j,k) ,

(3.12)

where ¯n is the predicted signal or background event rates with no systematic errors, ξ is
the nuisance parameter, and σi,j,k is obtained from the data release. We also add a signal
normalization uncertainty as

si,j,k = ¯si,j,k (1 + ξnorm σnorm) ,

(3.13)

where we set σnorm = 0.1 according to the data release (this corresponds to the “neutrino

4 Results

In this section we present the results of the analysis of the Dresden-II reactor experiment
data and its combination with COHERENT CsI and Ar data, for the BSM frameworks
presented in section 2.

4We have checked that the impact of the quenching factor uncertainties is negligible at the level of the

uncertainties quoted in the data release. Therefore, they are not included here.

4.1 Bounds on non-standard neutrino interactions

As described in section 2.1, in presence of NSI the Dresden-II reactor experiment is sensitive
to a unique combination of the ε coeﬃcients, QGe
e (ε), deﬁned in eq. (2.5), where we have
introduced an explicit superindex indicating the nucleus it refers to. We show in the

data provided by the experiment.

As seen in the ﬁgure, the analysis employing the Fef quenching factor results in slightly
stronger constraints. In most scenarios we ﬁnd that the analysis using the Fef quenching
factor reproduces slightly better the SM predictions and therefore leaves less room for new
physics. Exception, as we will see, is the case for some models with light vector mediators
for which a local non-standard minima appears in the analysis with the YBe quenching
factor, which results in slightly stronger constraints (see section 4.4).

CEνNS at the COHERENT experiment is sensitive to interactions of electron and
muon neutrinos and hence, it provides information on the corresponding eﬀective combi-

in the beam, degeneracies between NSI parameters corresponding to e and µ ﬂavors appear.
This is illustrated in ﬁgure 3, where we show the allowed regions obtained from our com-
bined analysis of CEνNS at COHERENT with both CsI and Ar targets for ﬂavor-diagonal
NSIs with up-quarks only (the results for NSI with only down-quarks are similar). The
shape of these regions for a given nucleus leads to allowed regions deﬁned by a band around

detector materials and, therefore, it may be broken by adding information on diﬀerent
nuclei, provided they have a diﬀerent ratio of protons to neutrons (for earlier discussions
on this, see, e.g., refs. [27, 33, 57, 90]). Most importantly, the use of timing information
at COHERENT translates into a partial discrimination between the weak charges for the
diﬀerent ﬂavors, thanks to the distinct composition of the prompt (νµ) and delayed (¯νµ and
νe) neutrino ﬂux. This leads to a partial breaking of this degeneracy which, however, is
not complete (see, e.g., ref. [44] for a more detailed explanation of this eﬀect). This is what
explains the results shown in ﬁgure 3. The regions allowed by COHERENT data present
a double-wedge shape due to the partial breaking of the degeneracy between those two
parameters after the inclusion of the energy and, in particular, the timing information.5
But yet, a continuous wide range of values of εu

ee remains allowed.

For the considered ﬂavor-diagonal NSI with up-quarks only, CEνNS at the Dresden-II
reactor experiment provides information on εu
ee only, so the allowed regions correspond to
the vertical bands in the ﬁgure. Consequently, the combined analysis of COHERENT +
Dresden-II results in a substantial reduction of the allowed values of εu
ee (and indirectly,
also on εu

µµ) as seen in the ﬁgure.

We ﬁnish by commenting that the results we show correspond to the case of diagonal
NSI with up-quarks only, but as mentioned above, similar results are obtained for diag-
onal NSI with down-quarks only. We also notice that the inclusion of ﬂavor oﬀ-diagonal
NSI couplings results in the enlargement of the regions shown in ﬁgure 3. Nevertheless,
within the current constraints from other experiments, in particular from neutrino oscil-
lations [44, 106], similar qualitative conclusions hold. For NSI couplings to both up and
down quarks, the complementarity between COHERENT and Dresden-II data depends
on the speciﬁc assumption about the ratio of diagonal couplings to both quarks. If they
are varied freely, meaningful constraints cannot be obtained, as can be understood from
ﬁgure 2. Therefore, current data from these experiments is not enough by itself to impose
meaningful constraints on the complete parameter space of NSI with quarks, if considered
in full generality.

4.2 Bounds on neutrino magnetic moments

The results of our analysis of data from the Dresden-II reactor experiment, including the
contribution induced by a neutrino magnetic moment, are shown in ﬁgure 4 where, on the
left panel, we plot the one-dimensional ∆χ2
D−II as a function µνe after proﬁling over all
background parameters β. As previously, we have neglected small eﬀects of any additional
systematic nuisance parameter, while the signal acceptance uncertainties are included in
the data provided by the experiment. For comparison, in the left panel we also show
∆χ2
D−II for the case of scattering oﬀ electrons only, including the SM CEνNS contribution
(dashed lines). As discussed in section 3.1, the contribution from ES induced by a neutrino
magnetic moment is subdominant to that from CEνNS. One must notice, however, that a

factor from the Chicago group [104]. See ref. [44] for a discussion about the small variation of the results
obtained with other quenching factors.

electrons and nucleons (solid curves). In both cases the SM CEνNS contribution is included. Right
panel: 90% CL excluded (one-sided) regions from the combination of Dresden-II and COHERENT
data (in color). We also indicate (with arrows) the 90% CL (one-sided) allowed regions from
Dresden-II data with the Fef (blue dotted line) and YBe (red dotted line) quenching factor, and
from the combined analysis of COHERENT CsI and Ar data (black dashed line). Notice that the
vertical lines for the Dresden-II reactor experiment are deﬁned one-sided for 1 dof (∆χ2 = 1.64),
while the rest of the regions are deﬁned for 2 dof (∆χ2 = 3.22).

better bound on µνe (and similarly for models with light scalar mediators, see below) could
be attainable with a dedicated analysis aimed at optimizing the sensitivity to the signal
from scattering of electrons. The signal acceptance at the lowest energies in the Dresden-II
experiment is quite small [16], which signiﬁcantly reduces statistics. Furthermore, given
the much ﬂatter shape of the event spectrum for the magnetic moment contribution than
from the SM, as depicted in ﬁgure 1, extending the ROI to higher energies could enhance
the signal-to-noise ratio (see, e.g., ref. [75]).

The ﬁt shows no evidence of a non-zero magnetic moment and therefore, the analysis

results in a bound which, at 90% CL (1 dof), reads

|µνe| <

for the Fef (YBe) quenching factor for germanium. This is an order of magnitude weaker
than the current best limit from reactor antineutrinos [107, 108]. Notice that here we
report two diﬀerent limits according to diﬀerent statistical criteria to derive constraints.
The reason is that the experiment is in fact sensitive to |µνe|2, which can only take non-
negative values. Therefore, accounting for the physical boundary, it is possible to report
the limit on |µνe| as a one-sided limit, which at 90% CL for 1 dof (2 dof) corresponds
to ∆χ2 = 1.64 (3.22). Conversely, if this restriction is not imposed, the result obtained
is what is denoted as a two-sided limit, which at 90%CL for 1 dof (2 dof) corresponds

For the sake of comparison
with diﬀerent results in the literature, we indicate in eq. (4.4) bounds obtained with both
criteria. As seen in eq. (4.4), the diﬀerence is at the level of 10%.

As mentioned in section 3.1 the µν-induced cross sections in eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) diverge
as the recoil energy goes to zero and this unphysical behavior is cut-oﬀ by the physical
requirement of the average energy required to produce an electron-hole pair, EI,min = 3 eV.
This raises the issue of the possible dependence of the bounds on the exact value of this
minimum energy that could trigger the detector. The dependence on the cut energy,
however, is approximately logarithmic and we have veriﬁed that increasing it by as much
as one order of magnitude results in weakening the bounds in eq. (4.4) by less than 25%.
CEνNS at the COHERENT experiment provides information on magnetic moments
for both νe and νµ.
In the right panel of ﬁgure 4, we show their 90% CL (2 dof, one-
sided) excluded values, obtained with our combined analysis of CEνNS at COHERENT
with both CsI and Ar targets. Because there is no interference between the contributions
from µνµ and µνe, the resulting allowed region is just a square with a rounded upper-
right corner. The 90% CL (1 dof, one-sided) upper bound from the Dresden-II reactor
experiment on µνe, eq. (4.4), is indicated by vertical lines. As seen in the ﬁgure, the
sensitivity of COHERENT to µνe is O(10) weaker. The combination of the two experiments
results in the 90% CL excluded regions (2 dof, one-sided) shown in the ﬁgure in color. The

In summary, we ﬁnd that for suﬃciently light mediators (Mφ (cid:46) 10−2 MeV), the bound
on the coupling constant is about a factor O(3) stronger if the interaction is coupled to
quarks than if it couples only to leptons. This is so because scalar-mediated CEνNS always
dominates over the corresponding scalar-mediated incoherent scattering oﬀ electrons for the
low-energy part of the spectrum, where statistics is best (see ﬁgure 1). Equivalently, in the

4.4 Bounds on light vector mediator models

The black dashed lines indicate the boundary of the regions excluded from the analysis
of COHERENT CsI and Ar data and the ﬁlled regions correspond to the results of the
COHERENT + Dresden-II combination. We see that COHERENT bounds only give some

one-sided and two-sided (1 dof) bounds.

Unlike the case of scalar mediators, in the small-mass limit, the bounds for vector me-
diators are very similar regardless of whether quarks are charged under the new interaction.
This is so because in this limit the Z(cid:48) contribution to the event rates is dominated by the
incoherent scattering oﬀ electrons, as seen in ﬁgure 1. We also notice that for all models,
the regions obtained with the YBe quenching factor present a dip around MZ(cid:48) ∼ 0.03 MeV
and |gZ(cid:48)| ∼ 10−6. This arises because the inclusion of scattering oﬀ electrons mediated
by such a particle provides a ﬁt which is better than the SM one at ∼ 1.5σ. Comparing

stringent than those on the Le model for MZ(cid:48) (cid:38) 0.2 MeV. For these masses, CEνNS starts
dominating over scattering oﬀ electrons.

For suﬃciently large mediator masses, the contact-interaction approximation is recov-
ered and the event rates vary with a power of |gZ(cid:48)| /MZ(cid:48), which ranges from a power of two,
due the interference with the SM, to a power of four, when the new vector contribution
is the dominant one (the interplay between the interference and quadratic contributions is
responsible for the disconnected island observed in the upper right excluded region of the
B − L model). From the ﬁgure, we read that, in this regime, the boundaries of the 90% CL

this approximation. Also, as mentioned above, for the universal and B − L models, the
combination with COHERENT slightly extends the large-mass part of the excluded region
beyond these values as seen in the ﬁgure.

5 Summary and conclusions

The ﬁrst evidence of observation of CEνNS with reactor electron antineutrinos has been
recently reported by an experiment conducted at the Dresden-II reactor site, using the
NCC-1701 germanium detector [16]. This adds to the previous measurements performed
by the COHERENT experiment, which uses neutrinos from a spallation neutron source
and has observed CEνNS using both CsI[Na] and Ar nuclei [2–5].

The very low momentum transfer produced by CEνNS renders this process an excellent
probe of new interactions in the neutrino sector.
In this paper, we have performed a
detailed analysis of the new data from the Dresden-II experiment, with the aim of deriving
powerful constraints on a variety of BSM scenarios. In particular, we have derived new
bounds on neutrino NSI with quarks, magnetic moments for electron and muon neutrinos,
and several models with light neutral scalar or vector mediators. Our analysis includes the
contributions to the event rates from CEνNS and from elastic scattering oﬀ electrons.

In our analysis of the Dresden-II data, we have taken special care in proﬁling over
the parameters required to accurately model the background, closely following the data
release of the experimental collaboration [16]. We have also quantiﬁed the dependence

– 22 –

of the results on the quenching factor by considering two models: one based on the use
iron-ﬁltered monochromatic neutrons (Fef) and another one based on photoneutron source
measurements (YBe). The impact on the results of the uncertainty on this parameter is
approximately indicated by the spread between the bounds obtained for these two models.
As for COHERENT, our analysis includes both timing and energy information in the case
of CsI, while in the case of the Ar data, we perform a χ2 analysis using time, energy and
F90 information. A careful treatment of systematic uncertainties is performed, following
the prescriptions provided by the collaboration in refs. [3, 5].

We have also quantiﬁed the impact of the combination of the new data from the
Dresden-II reactor experiment with COHERENT data. From the phenomenological point
of view, the main diﬀerence between these two experiments arises from the diﬀerent ﬂavor
composition of the neutrino ﬂux: while a nuclear reactor only emits ¯νe, at a spallation
neutron source neutrinos are primarily produced from pion decay at rest and therefore, the
ﬂux contains an equal admixture of νµ, ¯νµ, and νe, with higher energies than the reactor ¯νe
ﬂux. Therefore, generically, for models with lepton-ﬂavor dependent eﬀects (such as NSI),
COHERENT is a priori sensitive to a larger number of parameters. Nevertheless, the ﬂavor
discrimination with COHERENT comes from the timing information and is only partial.
Thus, within the current experimental precision, this results in degeneracies among the
µ-ﬂavor and e-ﬂavor parameters. The new Dresden-II data bring in complementary infor-
mation in this respect, as they provide independent constraints on the e-ﬂavor parameters.
As a result, the combination of both experiments allows breaking (or at least alleviating)
degeneracies present in the case of NSI, as illustrated in ﬁgure 3. Moreover, the combina-
tion of data obtained for scattering oﬀ diﬀerent nuclei (Ar and CsI for COHERENT, Ge
for the Dresden-II experiment) also adds additional synergies since, for a given set of NSI
parameters, the impact on the weak charge is diﬀerent depending on the particular nucleus
under consideration (see eq. (2.4)).

In the case of neutrino magnetic moment and light mediators with masses below
O(100 MeV), we generically ﬁnd that the Dresden-II experiment outperforms the bounds
obtained for COHERENT (an obvious exception is the magnetic moment of muon neu-
trinos, which is only constrained by COHERENT, since for the Dresden-II experiment
only a ¯νe ﬂux is available). This is a priori expected, since the Dresden-II experiment is
sensitive to much lower values of the momentum transfer, a critical feature which drives
the experimental reach of these scenarios. On the other hand, for mediators with masses
above O(100 MeV), we ﬁnd that COHERENT and Dresden-II lead to similar bounds for
the universal and B − L scenarios, while if the new interaction is coupled only to leptons,
the Dresden-II bound is more restrictive.

We ﬁnish by commenting on the role of ES. While the event rates from this process are
insigniﬁcant in the SM, their contribution could be signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence
of new physics eﬀects. Most notably, such contribution could pass the signal selection cuts
for both the Dresden-II experiment and the COHERENT CsI detector. In fact, for the
analysis of COHERENT CsI, this is a novel point of our analysis with respect to previous
works in the literature. Our results show that the inclusion of ES is particularly relevant in
scenarios with light vector mediators. In the case of COHERENT CsI, this improves the

– 23 –

bound on the coupling obtained from CEνNS alone for the B − L and universal models by
at least a factor ∼ 5, for mediator masses below ∼ 20 MeV. And a similar improvement
is obtained on the bounds derived from the Dresden-II reactor data when taking ES into
account. Conversely, in the reconstructed energy range of the Dresden-II experiment, the
contribution of ES induced by a neutrino magnetic moment and by light scalar mediators
is smaller than that from CEνNS. At higher energies, however, ES would also dominate
over CEνNS at the Dresden-II reactor experiment. Therefore, extending the reconstructed
energy region to higher energies could enhance the reach of the Dresden-II experiment
within these BSM scenarios.
