Are Astrophysical “Black” Holes Leaky?

Institute for Advanced Study, 1 Einstein Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.

Stephen L. Adler∗

We continue a study by Adler and Ramazano˘glu (AR) of “black” holes as modiﬁed by a

scale invariant dark energy action. For the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild-like case,

(AR) found that there is no event horizon; hence spacetime is not divided by the “black” hole

into causally disconnected regions. We review the formalism for locating trapped surfaces

and apparent horizons, and show that the modiﬁed “black” hole has no trapped surfaces.

Thus one suspects that it is “leaky”, and that there will be a “black hole wind” of parti-

cles streaming out from the location of the nominal horizon. This will have astrophysical

consequences, for example, the wind may feed and stabilize star formation in the vicinity of

the “black” hole. We initiate a study of the stationary axially-symmetric rotating “black”

hole as modiﬁed by a scale invariant dark energy action, i.e, one that is Kerr-like. To set

up the axial case, we note that the conserving completion of the dark energy stress energy

tensor can be calculated algebraically by solving a 2 × 2 matrix equation. Using Mathemat-

ica we calculate and simplify the modiﬁed system of Einstein equations for the axial case

in quasi-isotropic coordinates, and give appropriate boundary conditions. Solution of these

equations, which may require developing a special purpose numerical program, is rendered

tricky by a residual general coordinate invariance of quasi-isotropic coordinates. This leads

to the interesting mathematical question of representing a positive planar function as the

gradient squared of a harmonic function.

INTRODUCTION

A. Mathematical black holes versus astrophysical “black” holes

Mathematical black holes, as described in the magisterial review of Chandrasekhar [1], are

solutions of the Einstein ﬁeld equations characterized by just two parameters, the mass M and

the angular momentum per unit mass a. They have no other internal parameters, and possess an

event horizon that divides spacetime into two causally disconnected regions, the interior, which is

inaccessible to observers and from which nothing can escape, and the exterior, which is observable.

There are now many astrophysical observations implying the presence in the universe of ex-

tremely compact objects, which are interpreted as black holes. But are they true mathematical

black holes with an event horizon, or modiﬁed forms of the idealized black hole, that may lack an

event horizon and therefore have observable interiors? This question has been raised by a number

of authors, and is at the root of the present paper, which focuses on a compact object model

based on a novel form of dark energy, as described in the following subsection. Other proposals

for modiﬁed holes are discussed in a recent review by Cardoso and Pani [2], who give the name

“exotic compact objects” to a class of such models, and focus on possible signatures in gravitational

radiation for the lack of a horizon . Our focus is somewhat diﬀerent, on the possibility of particle

leakage from the compact object, which may have implications for astrophysical phenomena such

as star formation and the origin of jets.

But before proceeding, ﬁrst an observation about notation. If particles can leak out of a modiﬁed

hole, it is not black, and so referring to it as a black hole is a bit of a non sequitur. To clarify

this semantic issue we use in this article the term “black” hole, with the quotes denoting an object

which may have no event horizon, but which otherwise appears to astronomers very similar to the

idealized mathematical black hole. For mathematical black holes we continue to omit the quotes.

B. Motivations for a Weyl scaling invariant dark energy action

In papers over the last eight years [3]-[8] we have explored the postulate that the part of the

gravitational action that depends only on the undiﬀerentated metric gµν , but involves no metric

derivatives, is invariant under the Weyl scaling gµν → λgµν . Adoption of this postulate implies

that the so-called “dark energy” action has the three-space general coordinate invariant, but frame-

dependent, form

Seﬀ = −

Λ
8πG Z

,

rather than the usually assumed vacuum energy form

Seﬀ = −

Λ
8πG Z

d4x((4)g)1/2

,

(1)

(2)

where Λ is the observed cosmological constant, and (4)g = − det(gµν ). Since the unperturbed

Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological metric has g00 = 1, in this context

the action of Eq. (1) mimics the standard cosmological constant action of Eq. (2), but when g00

deviates from unity, their consequences diﬀer. There are a number of motivations for studying the

possibility that dark energy arises from the action of Eq. (1). First, we were led to it by a study [3]

3

of the induced gravitational action in our proposed pre-quantum theory based on trace dynamics,

where the properties of Weyl scaling invariance and frame dependence of the underlying theory

are inherited by the induced action. Second, quite independently ’t Hooft [9] has advocated that

Weyl scaling invariance is “the missing symmetry component of space and time”, and a natural

place to test this suggestion is in the dark energy action, the form of which is still a subject of

investigation, unlike the well-tested Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action and the standard model

particle action. Finally, assuming that dark energy arises as a vacuum energy from the action of

Eq. (2) leads to the cosmological constant ﬁne tuning problem, which is not implied by alternative

forms of the dark energy action. We have recently completed a mini-review [10] of our papers

[3]-[8], which includes an extended discussion of motivations for our postulate, to which the reader

is referred for further details.

Our more recent papers [7], [8] have been devoted to exploring cosmological implications of Eq.

(1) at the level of ﬁrst order cosmological perturbations from a FLRW background. The aim of

the current paper is to return to a study of the implications of the action of Eq. (1) for the physics

of “black” holes, begun in the paper [4] co-authored with Ramazano˘glu, referred to henceforth as

(AR). An extension of (AR) forms the subject of Section II of this paper, and our principal new

result is that for a Schwarzschild “black” hole as modiﬁed by the dark energy action of Eq. (1)

termed “Schwarzschild-like” in (AR)

(cid:0)
horizon and no trapped surfaces. Based on this, we conjecture (but do not prove) that there

, there is not only no event horizon, but also no apparent

will be a “black hole wind” emanating from the hole, and brieﬂy give some possible astrophysical

applications. In Section III we turn to extending our spherical results to the axially symmetric case,

corresponding to a Kerr “black” hole as modiﬁed by the dark energy action of Eq. (1) (which we

term “Kerr-like”). Here our principal new result is to set up the Einstein equations for the metric

components as modiﬁed by Eq.(1), in an explicit form suitable for numerical analysis. We analyze

a residual general coordinate invariance of axial quasi-isotropic coordinates and its mathematical

implications, and related to this, we discuss diﬃculties encountered in an attempted numerical

solution by the Mathematica diﬀerential equation solver. A numerical solution will be needed to

see if there are results for the horizon structure analogous to those found in the spherical case,

but it appears that a special purpose program may have to be developed in the future to complete

the numerical work in the axial case.

In Section IV we give a short list of problems for future

investigation, which is elaborated on in the review [10]. In the Appendix, we give some formulas

that were useful in checking the axial vector equations.

II. SCHWARZSCHILD-LIKE “BLACK” HOLES

In (AR) we gave analytic and numerical results of solving the Einstein equations arising from the

Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to the action of Eq. (1) in the spherically symmetric case, giving

rise to what we termed “Schwarzschild-like” “black” holes. We found that, as anticipated from the

−2
00 in Eq. (1), the horizon structure is substantially changed. At distances much larger
factor of g
than 2× 10−18M2 cm from the nominal horizon, with M the “black” hole mass in solar mass units,

the solutions closely resemble the standard Schwarzschild solution until cosmological distances are
reached. Within 2 × 10−18M2 cm from the nominal horizon, the behavior of g00 changes, with g00

remaining nonvanishing until an internal singularity is reached. In spherical coordinates, g00 has a

square root branch point in the vicinity of the nominal horizon, which is a coordinate singularity.

In isotropic coordinates, g00 remains nonzero and real analytic from cosmological distances down

to the internal physical singularity. There is no event horizon in the modiﬁed “black” hole, and

no division of physical space into causally disconnected regions. However, in (AR) we did not

examine whether there is an “apparent” horizon in the modiﬁed “black” hole, deﬁned as the outer

boundary of trapped surfaces, or in technical terms, the outermost marginally trapped surface [11].

The presence or absence of trapped surfaces is what determines whether material can leak out of

the “black” hole. Studying the apparent horizon structure of spherical, Schwarzschild-like “black”

holes, using the numerical solution in isotropic coordinates found in (AR), is the topic to which we

turn next.1

A. Theory of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons

We now summarize the theory of locating trapped surfaces and apparent horizons, as discussed

in the reviews [12] and [13], following closely the extension given in our article [14]. This is relevant

to the issue of “black” hole “leakiness” because when there are no trapped surfaces, and no event

or apparent horizons, it is no longer forbidden for material to ﬂow outwards from the modiﬁed

“black” hole.

For a compact, orientable 2-surface embedded in 4-space, there are two orthogonal directions

1 There is no closed form analytic solution in the Schwarzschild-like case. In addition to a numerical solution, there
are only approximate analytic results such as a few orders of expansions in powers of Λ, as developed in detail
in (AR). This contrasts with the case when the dark energy action is given by Eq. (2), which yields the closed
form analytic Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, and has a horizon surrounding the hole with similar properties to
the Schwarzschild case.

corresponding to outgoing and ingoing null rays, with respective tangents ℓν and nν respectively.

Let gµν be the metric

for which we take the (−, +, +, +) convention
(cid:0)

and gµν its inverse. We

(cid:1)

begin by forming the projector onto the 2-surface,

hµν = gµν +

ℓµnν + ℓν nµ
−ℓαnα

,

which if we adopt [15] the convenient normalization convention

becomes

ℓαnα = −2 ,

hµν = gµν +

ℓµnν + ℓν nµ
2

.

By construction, hµν projects the null vector normals to zero,

hµν ℓµ = hµν ℓν = hµν nµ = hµν nν = 0 .

Evidently the projector hµν is invariant under reciprocal rescalings of ℓν and nν according to

ℓν → κℓν , nν → κ

−1nν

.

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

A rescaling of ℓν and nν with constant κ has been considered previously by Ashtekar, Beetle, and

Lewandowski [16], Ashtekar and Krishnan [17] , and Krishnan [13], but here we allow κ = κ(x) to

be a general nonconstant scalar function of the spacetime coordinate x.

The expansion θℓ of a bundle (or congruence) of null rays associated with the tangent vector ℓ

is a measure of the fractional change of the cross sectional area of the bundle as one moves along

the central ray of the bundle. Using the projector hµν , the expansions θℓ and θn associated with
the outgoing and ingoing null vectors ℓν and nν are calculated from the formula

θℓ = hµν ∇µℓν ,

θn = hµν ∇µnν

,

(8)

with ∇µ as usual the covariant derivative. To see how these expansions transform under the

rescalings of Eq. (7), we note that

∇µκ(x)ℓν = ℓν∂µκ(x) + κ(x)∇µℓν

,

(9)

with ∂µ the partial derivative. Since the inhomogeneous term ℓν∂µκ is projected to zero by hµν by

virtue of Eq. (6), the expansion θℓ transforms under Eq. (7) by the simple scaling formula

θℓ → κθℓ

,

(10)

and similarly, θn transforms under the reciprocal scaling formula

with the product θℓθn invariant

θn → κ

−1θn

,

θℓθn → θℓθn

.

6

(11)

(12)

Thus calculations of the expansions θℓ, θn using the standard recipe have a covariance group under

the transformations of Eq. (7) with general non-constant κ(x), with the associated product of Eq.

(12) an invariant.

Consider now what happens if we compute the expansions θℓ,n for the same physics viewed

from diﬀerent choices of coordinates. In each coordinate system we have to pick null vectors ℓ and

n, and diﬀerent ways of doing this that satisfy the norm convention of Eq. (4) will diﬀer by the

rescaling freedom of Eq. (7). Thus, if we pick the most convenient deﬁnitions of ℓ and n in each

coordinate system, for example those with equal time components and opposite signs of the spatial

components, we will in general get diﬀerent values of the expansions θℓ, θn in the various coordinate

systems, with only the product θℓθn the same in all systems. However, the value of this product

is in itself a useful diagnostic. According to the usual classiﬁcation reviewed in [12]–[15], θℓθn < 0

corresponds to a normal or untrapped surface; θℓθn > 0 corresponds to a trapped or antitrapped

surface; and θℓθn = 0 corresponds to a marginal surface, such as the case θℓ = 0, θn > 0 which

deﬁnes the future apparent horizon. Thus an apparent horizon can be located by computing θℓθn

in any coordinate system, even though the individual values of θℓ and θn may vary.

As an illustration of this formalism, let us calculate θℓ and θn in spherical coordinates. We

write the general static spherically symmetric line element in the form,

ds2 = −F (r)2dt2 + G(r)2dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2

,

(13)

corresponding to gtt = −F (r)2 and grr = G(r)2. Making the convenient and symmetrical choice

ℓν =

nν =

1/F (r), 1/G(r), 0, 0

(cid:0)

,

(14)

which obey ℓαℓα = nαnα = 0 and ℓαnα = −2, a Mathematica calculation using the recipe of Eq.

(8) gives

θℓ =

2
rG(r)

,

θn = − θℓ

,

θℓθn = −

4
r2G(r)2

.

For a Schwarzschild black hole, G(r)2 = 1/F (r)2 = (1 − 2M/r)−1, so Eq. (15) becomes

θℓθn = −

4
r2 (1 − 2M/r)

.

7

(15)

(16)

This is negative for r > 2M , zero at r = 2M , and switches to positive for r < 2M . Thus the

spherical surfaces outside 2M are untrapped, and those within 2M are trapped, with an apparent

horizon (the outer boundary of trapped surfaces) at 2M . So in this case we get the expected result

that the apparent horizon coincides with the event horizon at r = 2M .

B. Absence of an apparent horizon in the Schwarzschild-like case

We now apply this recipe to see whether there is an apparent horizon, and whether there are

any trapped surfaces, in the Schwarzschild-like “black” hole studied in (AR). We start now from

the general static spherically symmetric line element written in isotropic coordinates,

ds2 = −

B(r)2
A(r)2 dt2 +

A(r)4
r4

(cid:0)

dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2

.

(17)

(cid:1)

To slightly simplify the calculation of the expansions, we deﬁne F (r) = B(r)/A(r), H(r) =

A(r)2/r2, in terms of which the line element becomes

ds2 = −F (r)2dt2 + H(r)2

dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

.

Suitable null vectors ℓν and nν satisfying the normalization convention of Eq. (4) are

ℓν =
(cid:0)
nν =
(cid:0)

1/F (r), 1/H(r), 0, 0
(cid:1)
1/F (r), −1/H(r), 0, 0
(cid:1)

,

,

(18)

(19)

and substituting these into the recipe of Eq. (8) gives

θℓ =2

Hence

ℓ = −

4r2
A(r)6 [2rA

′

(r) − A(r)]2 ≤ 0.

8

(20)

(21)

Let us ﬁrst apply Eq. (21) to the case of an ordinary Schwarzschild black hole viewed in isotropic

coordinates, for which

′
B = r − M/2 , A = r + M/2 , A

′
= 1 , 2rA

− A = r − M/2

.

(22)

In these coordinates the event horizon is at r = M/2, where B vanishes. Since the mapping relating

the spherical radial coordinate ¯r,

which we denoted as r in Eqs. (13)-(16) of the previous section

to the isotropic radial coordinate r of this section is

(cid:0)

¯r = r

1 +

(cid:18)

2

M
2r (cid:19)

= r + M +

M 2
4r

,

(cid:1)

(23)

at r = M/2 one has ¯r = 2M , giving the spherical coordinate event horizon location. However,

we see that the isotropic coordinate domain 0 < r < ∞ gives a double covering of the spherical

coordinate domain 2M < r < ∞, and never reaches the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole as

described in spherical coordinates. That is why θℓθn of Eq. (21) never attains positive values, and

so only describes the untrapped surfaces in the exterior of the Schwarzschild black hole.

We have gone through this detail in the Schwarzschild case, to emphasize that when using

isotropic coordinates in the Schwarzschild-like case of a spherical “black” hole as modiﬁed by

the scale invariant dark energy action of Eq. (1), we must establish whether these coordinates

give a covering of the interior region as well as the exterior region, or only a double covering

of the exterior region.

In Section 3 of (AR) a numerical analysis of Schwarzschild-like “black”

holes was given, after introducing dimensionless variables by rescalings Λ → 1, r → x = Λ1/2r,
and M → ˆM = Λ1/2M . For details of the Einstein equations and boundary conditions that
were integrated using these rescalings see (AR). Sample results for a rescaled mass ˆM = 10−6

were obtained by using the Mathematica integrator NDSolve, which indicated the presence of
singularities at xlower = 5.000061 × 10−7 and xupper = 0.8276970. We interpreted the singularity at

9

xupper as the singularity at ∞ found in (AR) in polar coordinates, i.e., a singularity at cosmological

distances, and we interpreted the singularity at xlower as the singularity interior to the “black” hole.

This interpretation is supported by computing the proper distance between the singularities,

D = Λ

−1/2

xupper

Z

xlower

dx

A(x)2
x2 = 0.927374Λ

−1/2

,

(24)

in excellent agreement with the value D = 0.927371Λ−1/2 for the proper distance from the polar

radius ¯r = 0 to ¯r = ∞ computed using the zero mass limit of the “master equation” derived in

the spherical case. Thus the isotropic coordinate calculation gives a single covering of the region

extending from the interior singularity of the Schwarzschild-like “black” hole to to the singularity

at cosmological distances, and not a double covering of the exterior region of the “black” hole.

We can now turn to discuss whether the Schwarzschild-like “black” hole has horizons. In Fig.

5 of (AR) we exhibited a plot of g00(x) in isotropic coordinates, showing that there is no event

horizon between xlower and xupper. From Eq. (21), we see that the product θℓθn ≤ 0, and so there

are no trapped surfaces where this product is positive. A plot of θℓ versus x − xlower is given here in
Fig. 1, which shows that θℓ vanishes only at x − xlower ≃ 1.4097 × 10−9. But this cannot be termed

an apparent horizon because the spherical surfaces lying within it are untrapped, so it is not an
outer boundary of trapped surfaces. The proper distance from xlower to xlower + 1.4097 × 10−9 is
5.6347 × 10−9Λ−1/2, a minute fraction of the proper distance D = 0.927374Λ−1/2 between xlower
and xupper.2 So in the analysis of θℓθn there is again no indication of the double covering found

in the unmodiﬁed Schwarzschild case. Thus we conclude that unlike the Schwarzschild black hole,

which has an apparent horizon coinciding with its event horizon, the Schwarzschild-like “black”

hole has no event horizon, no apparent horizon, and no trapped surfaces.

C. A “black hole wind” and possible astrophysical consequences

For a Schwarzschild-like “black” hole with no interior trapped surfaces, the possibility is thus

opened for there to be a leakage of particles from the interior to outside the nominal horizon. This

ﬂux would be quite distinct from the quantum mechanical Hawking radiation ﬂux, and could be

orders of magnitude larger. Therefore we postulate that emerging from “black” holes, as modiﬁed

by the dark energy action of Eq. (1), there will be a “black hole wind” of particles with enough

velocity to escape to an astronomical distance from the hole. An important issue for the future will

2 Since the zero in θℓ is so close in proper distance to the singularity at xlower, and is absent for some choices of

formally equivalent diﬀerential equation systems, it may well be a computational artifact.

be extending the calculation of the preceding section to include normal matter that has entered

the “black” hole, but is not permanently trapped, and developing the physical concepts needed

to calculate the ﬂux of particles emerging from the hole. So we do not claim to have “proved”

the existence of a “black” hole wind, only to have established that it is plausible possibility given

the modiﬁcations in horizon structure induced by the action of Eq. (1). If there is a “black” hole

wind, it could have interesting astrophysical consequences. We here note two of them; see also the

discussion in the review [10].

11

• Observations of the central “black” hole in our galaxy show the presence of young stars in its

close vicinity. Lu et al. open their article [18] by stating that: “One of the most perplexing

problems associated with the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy is the origin

of young stars in its close vicinity”. Similar clusters of young stars are found in the vicinity

of supermassive “black” holes in nearby galaxies [19]. A “black” hole wind of particles could

possibly furnish a mechanism for the origin of such stars, both by providing material for

their formation, and by providing an outward pressure cushioning nascent stars against the

gravitational tidal forces of the “black” hole. This idea could be tested in a phenomenological

way, by postulating parameters for the “black” hole wind (particle type, velocity, ﬂux) and

seeing if they can account for young star formation [20]. Related considerations apply to the

possibility of galaxy formation catalyzed by a central leaky “black” hole [21].

• The presence of highly collimated jets that emerge from active galactic nuclei, which are

believed to contain supermassive “black” holes, is a striking feature that has attracted much

attention. The prevailing models for the formation of these jets, in particular the Blandford-

Znajek [22] mechanism, assume no material (other than the negligible Hawking radiation

ﬂux) emerges from the horizon of the central hole, as expected for an idealized mathematical

black hole. If this assumption is incorrect, and there is a “black” hole wind at the classical

physics level, this wind could play a contributing role in the formation of the observed jets.

Thus it will be interesting to solve the rotating “black” hole analog of the calculations of the

preceding section, to get the structure of a rapidly rotating Kerr-like “black” hole, to see if

there is evidence for preferential emission of a “black” hole wind along the directions of the

rotation axis.

III. KERR-LIKE “BLACK” HOLES

In Section II we discussed the horizon structure of modiﬁed spherically symmetric “black” holes.

But just as Schwarzschild black holes are a special case of axially-symmetric, rotating Kerr black

holes, we expect there to be modiﬁed axially symmetric “Kerr-like” “black” holes generalizing the

spherically symmetric “Schwarzschild-like” “black” holes studied in (AR) and in Section II. To

12

get analogous results for these, we will ﬁrst have to generalize to the axial case the analytic and

numerical analysis of (AR), the topic to which we now turn.

A. Setting up the axial case: Quasi-isotropic coordinates, conserving completion of the

stress-energy tensor, Einstein equations, and boundary conditions

A suﬃciently general line element for a stationary axially symmetric metric [1] is

ds2 = − e2ν dt2 + e2ψ(dφ − ωdt)2 + e2µ(dρ2 + dz2)

=(−e2ν + ω2e2ψ)dt2 − 2e2ψωdtdφ + e2ψdφ2 + e2µ(dρ2 + dz2)

,

with the four quantities ν, ψ, µ, ω functions of ρ and z. We have written this line element in terms

of cylindrical coordinates ρ and z, which are related to the spherical coordinates r and θ used in

(25)

Eq. (17) by

from which we see that

ρ = r sin θ ,

z = r cos θ

,

dρ2 + dz2 = dr2 + r2dθ2

.

(26)

(27)

Thus, as in Eq. (17), the line element diﬀerentials in the ρ − z or equivalently r − θ plane have a

common coeﬃcient, which is why Eq. (25) is the axial analog of the spherical isometric line element

of Eq. (17), and why it is termed quasi-isometric. The Kerr metric can be readily transformed [23],

[24] from spherical Boyer-Lindquist coordinates to the quasi-isometric coordinates of Eq. (25).

Setting up the Einstein equations arising from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the dark energy

action of Eq. (1) proceeds in a number of steps, all of which we carried out using the algebraic

calculation tools of Mathematica. We summarize the steps in outline form, and then state the ﬁnal

results.

• As discussed in detail in [3] and in [10], since the dark energy action of Eq. (1) is only

three-space general coordinate invariant, its variation with respect to the full metric gµν

does not yield a covariantly conserved stress-energy tensor to serve as the source term for

the Einstein equations.3 The correct way to use Eq. (1) is to vary it with respect to the

3 An action gives consistent equations of motion when varied with respect to independent dynamical variables.

13

six independent spatial metric components gij, giving the spatial components of the stress-

energy tensor T ij. When the Einstein-Hilbert action is included, varying with respect to

gij gives the spatial components of the Einstein equations Gij = −8πGTij. Then one can

determine the remaining components T 0j = T j0 and T 00 by solving the diﬀerential equations

for covariant conservation (as dictated by the Bianchi identities obeyed by Gµν , which require
∇µT µν = 0), a procedure that we term covariant completion. Covariant derivatives are
conveniently calculated using a special purpose Mathematica notebook for general relativity.4

In the spherically symmetric “black” hole case studied in [4], covariant completion reduces

to an algebraic equation in one variable T tt ≡ T 00, which can be immediately solved. In the

axially-symmetric case with the line element of Eq. (25), covariant completion reduces to a

set of simultaneous algebraic equations in the two unknowns T tt and T tφ = T φt, which are

readily solved using the coeﬃcient extraction and matrix inversion functions of Mathematica.

• Using the Mathematica notebook for general relativity, the Einstein tensor corresponding to

the metric of Eq. (25) is readily generated. Only four components of the Einstein tensor are

needed to give four equations to determine the four metric functions ν, ψ, µ, ω, and we take

these as Gtt, Gρρ + Gzz, Gφφ, and Gtφ. The Einstein equations then follow from equating

Gµν to the full stress-energy tensor term −8πGTµν obtained by covariant completion.

• We ﬁnd that the resulting equations take a slightly simpler form when linear combinations

are taken which isolate in separate equations the second derivatives ∇2ν, ∇2ψ, ∇2µ, and

∇2ω, plus terms with ﬁrst derivatives or no derivatives of the unknown functions, with ∇2

the two-dimensional Laplacian

∇2 ≡ (∂ρ)2 + (∂z)2

.

(28)

This is accomplished by further use of the matrix operations of Mathematica.

The result of these Mathematica calculations is a set of four second-order diﬀerential equations

to be solved in the axially symmetric case. In these equations, the terms with no coeﬃcient Λ come

The 10 components of the full metric gµν are not independent, because they should be restricted by coordinate
conditions. However, when the action is four-space general coordinate invariant, one gets the correct energy-
momentum tensor by varying with respect to the full gµν, treating all 10 components as independent. This
works because the action is invariant under general coordinate transformations, and so changes in the coordinate
conditions reducing the 10 components to 6 independent ones produce an action variation of zero.

check Bianchi identities and covariant conservation, in addition to its original purpose of computing the Einstein
tensor.

from varying the Einstein-Hilbert action by itself, and are obeyed by the Kerr metric rewritten

in quasi-isotropic coordinates given in Appendix A.1. The terms with Λ as coeﬃcient arise from

varying the Weyl scaling invariant dark energy action of Eq. (1) with respect to the spatial metric

components, and then carrying out a conserving completion to give the full stress energy tensor

that is covariantly conserved, as required for consistency by the Bianchi identities. Solving the

following set of equations numerically will give the axial rotating analog of the spherical calculation

performed in (AR), and will permit study of horizon structure (the event horizon, apparent horizon,

and presence or absence of trapped surfaces) in the Kerr-like case:

In writing these equations we have abbreviated

As checks on the manipulations leading to Eqs. (29)–(32), (i) as noted above, we checked that the

quasi-isotropic Kerr metric line element given in Appendix A.1 obeys the empty space equations

obtained by dropping the dark energy terms with coeﬃcient Λ , and (ii) we checked that the spher-

ically symmetric specialization of the axial formulas given in Appendix A.2 reduces to equations

that both numerically and algebraically reproduce the results for the Schwarzschild-like case given

in (AR).

Since we expect the solution to have reﬂection symmetry z ↔ −z, it suﬃces to solve these

equations in the domain z ≥ 0, imposing the condition that ∂zω = ∂zµ = ∂zψ = ∂zν = 0 for all

ρ on the axis where z = 0. For boundary conditions at “inﬁnity”, we require that suﬃciently far

from the origin, say ρ ≥ ρ0 and z ≥ z0 for some speciﬁed ρ0 and z0, the solutions should agree with

the leading large distance terms in the Kerr metric when written in quasi-isotropic coordinates.

Thus at large distances we require

ω ≃2M a/r3

,

e2µ ≃1 + 2M/r

,

e2ψ ≃ρ2(1 + 2M/r)

,

e2ν ≃1 − 2M/r

,

r =(ρ2 + z2)1/2

,

(34)

with M the “black” hole mass and a the “black” hole angular momentum per unit mass. At ρ0,

Eq. (34) and its ﬁrst partial derivative with respect to ρ should be used as boundary conditions,

in lieu of a boundary condition on the rotation axis ρ = 0.5

B. Residual general coordinate invariance of quasi-isotropic coordinates

The line element of Eq. (25) has a residual general coordinate invariance consisting of a con-

formal mapping in the ρ, z plane,

ρ = f (ρ

) ,

z = g(ρ

).

(35)

5 In (AR) we stated that in the spherical case we had to use the leading large r term plus ﬁrst order corrections
in Λ as the large distance boundary condition. On recalculating now, we ﬁnd that substantially identical results
are obtained for the parameter values used in (AR) when the ﬁrst order corrections in Λ are dropped in the large
distance boundary condition.

A standard result [1] is that this preserves the form of Eq. (25) when

f,1 = g,2

,

f,2 = −g,1

,

which implies that both f and g are harmonic, ∇′2f = ∇′2g = 0, and gives for the mapping

The ﬁnal line of Eq. (37) shows that the positive quantity X is also the Jacobian of the transfor-

mation.

For the partial derivatives with respect to ρ′ and z′ we ﬁnd from Eq. (35) that,

Using Eqs.

(37)–(41), one easily veriﬁes that the diﬀerential equations Eqs.

(29)–(33) are

invariant in form under the coordinate transformation of Eq. (37), while the boundary conditions of

Eq. (34) are not invariant and serve to specify the coordinate choice uniquely. This makes numerical

solution of the diﬀerential equations tricky. For example, the Mathematica solver NDSolve returns

a warning that the equations are “convective” and likely to be unstable, which we suspect may be

a reﬂection of the invariance of Eq. (37) that is only broken by the boundary conditions. We leave

the issue of how to solve the axial case equations for further study; it appears that it may require

development of a special purpose program, as opposed to using a commercial diﬀerential equation

solver such as that in Mathematica.

17

C. A mathematical question: When can a positive planar function be represented as the

gradient squared of a harmonic function, or equivalently, as the modulus squared of a

holomorphic function?

The invariance demonstrated in Section IIIB poses the following question, which we discussed at

length with several mathematician colleagues: Given a two dimensional positive-deﬁnite6 function

X(ρ, z) > 0, can one ﬁnd a harmonic function ∇2f (ρ, z) = (∂2

ρ + ∂2

z )f (ρ, z) = 0 such that X is its

squared gradient, X(ρ, z) = (∂ρf )2 + (∂zf )2 ?

A necessary condition noted by Camillo De Lellis [26] is that since f is harmonic, one has

∇2X = ∂i∂i(∂jf )2 = 2(∂i∂jf )2 ≥ 0,

(42)

that is, X must be subharmonic. A stronger condition pointed out by Terence Tao [27] is that

“Letting g be the harmonic conjugate of f , we have from the Cauchy-Riemann equations that
log X = 2 log |f ′ + ig′| must be harmonic (except at zeroes), so this is a necessary condition,

possibly also suﬃcient.” Since

0 = ∇2 log X = (∇2X)/X − (∂iX)2/X 2,

(43)

the condition ∇2 log X = 0 implies the inequality of Eq. (42).

To give a formal argument, we begin by noting following De Lellis [26] that the conditions

X(ρ, z) = (∂if )2 with f harmonic, and X(ρ, z) = |h|2 with h a holomorphic function of ρ + iz, are

equivalent. For f harmonic, the complex function deﬁned by h = hR + ihI ≡ ∂ρf − i∂zf obeys

the Cauchy-Riemann equations ∂ρhR = ∂zhI , ∂zhR = −∂ρhI , and so is holomorphic with respect

to the complex variable ρ + iz, and has the magnitude X 1/2. Conversely, if h is holomorphic the

Cauchy-Riemann equations are integrability conditions which imply that hR and hI are gradients

of a harmonic“potential” f (ρ, z), that is hR = ∂ρf , hI = −∂zf .

Following Tao [27], taking the logarithm of h we have

log h =

1
2

log X + i arg h ,

(44)

and since the logarithm of a holomorphic function is also holomorphic, we have new Cauchy-

6 The positive semi-deﬁnite case is ruled out, as noted by Helmut Hofer [25] and Camillo De Lellis [26], because the
continuation properties of harmonic functions imply that if X vanishes on an open set, it vanishes everywhere.

(45)

Diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst line with respect to ρ, the second line with respect to z, adding and doubling

we get

ρ log X + ∂2
∂2

z log X = ∇2 log X = 0

,

(46)

which is the asserted necessary condition. Following De Lellis [26], this argument can be run in

reverse. In the language of diﬀerential forms, Eq. (46) states that the diﬀerential form

χ := ∂ρ log Xdz − ∂z log Xdρ

is closed,

dχ = ∂2

ρ log Xdρdz − ∂2

z log Xdzdρ = ∇2 log Xdρdz = 0 .

(47)

(48)

On a simply connected domain, this implies by the Poincar´e lemma that χ is exact, which implies

Eq.

(45), and therefore the existence of a holomorphic function h of which X is the absolute

value squared. This shows that on a simply connected domain the condition of Eq. (46) is also a

suﬃcient condition.

As noted by Tao [27], When the domain is not simply connected, the variation (holonomy)

of arg h around a closed curve γ not passing through singularities is a multiple of 2πi, but not

necessarily zero. From Eq. (45), we have

1
2

Zγ

(∂ρ log Xdz − ∂z log Xdρ) = 2πn

for some integer n, or equivalently,

∂ρXdz − ∂zXdρ
X

Zγ

= 4πn .

(49)

(50)

Assuming there are no essential singularities, this condition gives an additional constraint on X,

which asserts that the line integral of Eq. (50) is quantized, and the order of blowup of X around

each singularity has to be an even integer.

19

D. A “ no-go” result for the attempted reduction of the four-function axial line element to

three-function form

We now use the mathematical results of the preceding section to show that the invariance

exhibited in Section IIIB cannot be eliminated by using it to reduce the four function axial line

element to a three function form.

We begin by remarking that the inverse transformation to Eq. (35) can be written as

′

ρ

= F (ρ, z)

,

′

z

= G(ρ, z)

,

(51)

and since the inverse of a conformal map is also conformal, F and G are both harmonic, a fact that

will be used later on. Applying the transformation of Eq. (37) to the line element of Eq. (25), the

eﬀect of the mapping is to replace 2µ in ﬁnal term by 2µ + log X, and since the theorem of Section

IIIC implies that log X is harmonic, the covariance group of the line element consists of adding a

harmonic function to µ. Thus the solution to the diﬀerential equation system is made unique by

boundary conditions on µ suﬃcient to uniquely specify a harmonic function.

What would be nice is to ﬁx X by imposing the coordinate condition

e2µX = e2ψ/ρ

′ 2 ≡ e2κ,

(52)

so that the line element becomes

ds2 = (−e2ν + ω2ρ

′ 2e2κ)dt2 − 2e2κρ

′ 2ωdtdφ + e2κ(dρ

′ 2 + dz

′ 2 + ρ

′ 2dφ2)

,

(53)

which apart from the rotation ω has a conformal spatially Euclidean form. This involves only three

unknown functions ν, κ, ω instead of four, and if attainable could simplify numerical calculations

using the line element of Eq. (25). Unfortunately, we shall see that in general this simpliﬁcation

is not possible, as exempliﬁed by the speciﬁc example of the Kerr metric.

To make this transformation, we need to impose

with ρ′ = F (ρ, z)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

log X = 2(ψ − µ) − 2 log F,

(54)

which using the condition ∇2 log X = 0 gives

∇2 log F =∇2(ψ − µ)

= − Y

,

Y =2[ν,1(ρ, z)ψ,1(ρ, z) + ν,2(ρ, z)ψ,2(ρ, z)]

+ψ,1(ρ, z)2 + ψ,2(ρ, z)2 + (3/4)e

−2ν(ρ,z)+2ψ(ρ,z)[ω,1(ρ, z)2 + ω,2(ρ, z)2]

,

(55)

20

where we have substituted the empty space form of the Einstein equations for ψ and µ; when

matter or dark energy is present there will be additional terms in Y .

Since ∇2F = 0,

Y = −∇2 log F = (∂iF )2/F 2 ≥ 0,

(56)

that is, Y must be positive semi-deﬁnite. An additional condition can be found by further appli-

cation of the result of Sec. IIIC. Rewriting Eq. (56) as

log Y = log(∂iF )2 − 2 log F ,

(57)

and noting that since F is harmonic, the results of Section IIIC imply that ∇2 log(∂iF )2 = 0.

Therefore Eq. (57) implies

∇2 log Y = −2∇2 log F ,

and using Eq. (55) this becomes a condition on Y ,

∇2 log Y = 2Y

.

(58)

(59)

The problem formulated in Section IIIB is to analyze a deformation of the Kerr metric resulting

from the dark energy action of Eq. (1), with a boundary condition that the modiﬁed metric should

asymptote to the Kerr metric. A numerical study of the Kerr metric using Mathematica shows that

Y for Kerr is indeed everywhere non-negative, but a numerical check on the condition of Eq. (59)

at a few sample points shows that it is not satisﬁed. Therefore for both Kerr and the deformation

under study, a conformal transformation cannot be used to reduce the original four-function line

element of Eq. (25) to the three-function form of Eq. (53), which if possible would have simpliﬁed

the problem of ﬁnding a stable numerical solution.

IV. OPEN ISSUES

The exposition of the preceding sections leaves a number of evident open issues. Here are a few,

more are given in the review [10] :

• What is the physics governing the “black” hole interior in the Schwarzschild-like case? Can

one prove that the modiﬁed “black” hole leaks particles? How does one calculate the leakage

rate? We plan to ﬁrst address these questions in the computationally tractable spherical

case.

21

• Can a phenomenological parametrization of the leakage be used to explain some of the

puzzling features of the vicinity of the “black” hole at the center of our Galaxy? See [20]

for preliminary ideas. Similarly, can it be used to help model galaxy formation, where

preliminary ideas are given in [21].

• What is the best way to numerically solve the axial case equations? Would minimization of

a cost function formed from the diﬀerential equations and boundary conditions work?

• Does the solution in the axial case suggest a possible role in jet formation or other directional

phenomena?

Further study of these issues is planned.

Appendix A: Formlas used for checking the axial-vector equations

1. The Kerr metric in quasi-isotropic coordinates

We give here the Kerr metric after transformation [23], [24] from Boyer-Lindquist to quasi-

isotropic coordinates. In terms of the cylindrical coordinates ρ, z, and the spherical coordinate

radius r = (ρ2 + z2)1/2, auxiliary quantities χ2, ˜ρ2, ∆, and Σ are given by

χ2 =[1 + (M + a)/(2r)][1 + (M − a)/(2r)]

,

˜ρ2 =r2χ4 + a2z2/r2

,

∆ =r2χ4 − 2M rχ2 + a2

,

Σ =(r2χ4 + a2)2 − ∆ a2ρ2/r2

.

(A1)

In terms of these, the functions appearing in the Kerr line element when put in the quasi-isotropic

form of Eq. (25) are given by

22

e2ν =1 − 2M rχ2/˜ρ2 + (2M ρχ2a)2/(˜ρ2Σ)

,

e2ψ =Σρ2/(˜ρ2r2)

,

e2µ =˜ρ2/r2

,

ω =2M rχ2a/Σ .

We have checked these formulas by using Mathematica to show that they obey Eqs. (29)–(32) when

the dark energy terms with coeﬃcient Λ and denominators D1 and D2 are dropped. Expanding

Eqs. (A2) to leading order in M gives the formulas used as boundary conditions in Eq. (34).

(A2)

2. Spherically symmetric specialization of the axial equations

The spherical reduction of Eq. (25) is obtained by specializing to

ω = 0 , µ = µ(r) , ν = ν(r) , ψ = µ(r) + log ρ .

(A3)

Using ∂ρr = ρ/r and ∂zr = z/r, we ﬁnd that the axial diﬀerential equations reduce to (with ′

denoting d/dr)

Numerically solving Eq. (A5) for µ′′ together with Eq. (A4) for ν′′ gives results for the spherical

isotropic coordinate case in agreement with those of [4], and we also checked that these formulas

reduce algebraically to those used in [4].
