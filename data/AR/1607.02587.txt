Introduction

The Resistive Plate WELL (RPWELL) [1] is a single-faced (Copper-clad on one side) Thick Gas
Electron Multiplier (THGEM) [2, 3], coupled to a segmented readout anode through a high bulk
resistivity plate (ﬁgure 1). Extensive laboratory studies of small RPWELL detector prototypes
operated in Ne/(5%CH4) [1] have been performed; they were followed by larger (10 × 10 cm2 )
detector investigations, with pad readout, in muon and pion beams. These were operated in
Ne/(5%CH4) [4], and in Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2) [5]. These and other studies of THGEM-
like detectors (summarized in [6]), aimed at validating the potential applicability of the RPWELL
as sampling element in digital hadron calorimetry (DHCAL). They have demonstrated discharge-
free operation at high gas-avalanche gains, over a broad dynamic range. The results summarized
in [4, 5], were obtained with detectors having a 5 mm conversion/drift gap, followed by a single
thin (0.8 mm) multiplier, coupled through a 0.4 mm thick Semitron(cid:114) ESD2251 resistive plate -
to an anode segmented into 1 cm2 pads; charge signals from the pads were recorded by a single
APV25 chip [7] and SRS readout system [8]. Detection eﬃciency values greater than 98% were
reached, at low average pad multiplicity values of ∼1.2 - in all three gas mixtures; moreover, in
these conditions, the RPWELL detector displayed no discharges, also under a high pion ﬂux. Con-
stant detection eﬃciency was recorded up to a pion ﬂux of 104 Hz/cm2, decreasing by a few percent
at ∼105 Hz/cm2. These former results, obtained with small detector prototypes, suggested that RP-
WELL detectors are promising for applications that require cost-eﬀective solutions for large-area
coverage. For example, the Digital, or Semi-Digital Hadron Calorimeter ((S)DHCAL) [9, 10],
foreseen for the SiD experiment in the future international linear collider (ILC) [11], the overall
instrumented area will be as large as ∼4000 m2. Another application could be photon detection

for large-area UV-RICH detectors [12, 13]. Previous studies with large area THGEM detectors are
described in [14] and in [15]; in the latter, two 30 × 30 cm2 double-faced THGEM electrodes in
cascade are followed by a MICROMEGAS. Although this conﬁguration is diﬀerent than the RP-
WELL one, common aspects were considered. These include the mechanical support used in the
detector assembly and various quality criteria imposed on the THGEM electrodes themselves. Mo-
tivated by these results, in this work we address the challenge of scaling up the detector dimensions.
For the ﬁrst time, a fully equipped medium-size (30 × 30 cm2 ) RPWELL detector was assembled
and investigated in muon and high-rate pion beams, with Neon- and Argon-based gas mixtures.
The experimental setup and methodology are described in section 2. The results are presented in
section 3 followed by a summary and discussion in section 4.

2 Experimental setup and methodology

2.1 The 30×30 cm2 RPWELL detector prototype

The RPWELL simpliﬁed scheme is shown in ﬁgure 1; a single-sided THGEM electrode is coupled
to the readout anode through a resistive plate, preceded by a conversion/drift gap and a cathode.
Various detector parts and their assembly are shown in ﬁgure 2.

Based on our previous studies [4, 16], we used a single-sided Copper-clad FR4 THGEM elec-
trode2 with a nominal thickness of 0.8 mm; its measured thickness (including both Copper and
FR4) was 0.96 mm, with variations smaller than 40 µm across the surface. Variations of this level
(∼4%) were also observed in other works employing large-area THGEM electrodes [17]. The re-
sulting gain variations (as high as 50% for the detector studied in [17]), can be mitigated in future
detectors by proper selection of the FR4 sheets. The electrode had 0.5 mm diameter holes, drilled
on a 1 mm pitch hexagonal pattern; chemically etched 0.1 mm rims around the holes prevented
sharp edges and other eventual defects. The 30 × 30 cm2 THGEM electrode comprised six elec-
trically decoupled 5×30 cm2 segments (ﬁgure 2-a); 3 mm gaps were left between neighboring
segments, to avoid inter-segment discharges in case of signiﬁcant potential drop on one of them. In
this study, the inter-segment dead-area was not optimized for eﬃciency losses. The readout anode
was composed of a 30×30 matrix of 1×1 cm2 readout pads (ﬁgure 2-b); the individual pads were

electrically connected to a 0.4 mm thick Semitron(cid:114) ESD2253 static dissipative polymer plate of
∼109 Ωcm bulk resistivity (ﬁgure 2-c). To assure good electrical contact, the bottom of the resistive
material was mechanically patterned (by 1 mm wide, 50 µm deep machined groves) into 1 cm2 pads
(corresponding to the metal pads of the readout electrode); each of them was coated with Pelco(cid:114)
conductive silver paint4. The resistive-plate pads were individually connected to corresponding
readout pads with small pieces of 3MTM Electrically Conductive Adhesive Transfer Tape 97075.
Figure 2-d shows the positioning of the resistive plate on top of the readout anode. For practical
reasons, the cathode was also a THGEM electrode of similar geometry, with all the segments in-
terconnected. In the present work, the detector was designed in a modular way, mounted within an
aluminum vessel, to permit modiﬁcations. Therefore, to assure conversion/drift gap homogeneity
and good contact between electrodes, rather than using glued spacers, the detector components
were assembled on an array of 49 nylon pins of 3 mm diameter (ﬁgure 2-e); these were ﬁxed to
the 6 mm thick padded-anode board using buttons and o-rings (ﬁgure 2). The pins were arranged
over the active area in a square lattice with 5 cm pitch. The conversion/drift gap was determined by
5 mm diameter, 5 mm thick Delrin(cid:114) spacers inserted on the nylon pins; they were pressing on rub-
ber o-rings, mounted underneath, against the THGEM electrode in an attempt to avoid open paths
along the pins between the THGEM segment edge and the anode (see ﬁgure 3-c). This is shown
to scale in the mechanical design in ﬁgure 3, and discussed in detail in section 3.2. The cathode
was placed on top of the spacers; the whole detector stack was closed with nylon nuts to ensure
uniform contact between the THGEM electrode and the resistive plate. The detector was mounted
in a gas-tight vessel with gas and high-voltage (HV) feed-through connectors. The readout anode
board served also as the bottom part of the vessel. The anode was grounded through the readout,
while the THGEM electrode and the cathode were biased by individual channels of CAEN A1833P
and A1821N HV power-supply boards, remotely controlled with a CAEN SY2527 unit. Each cou-
ple of THGEM segments was independently biased (segments 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 in ﬁgure 2-a), using
diﬀerent HV supply channels. The voltage and current in each channel were monitored and stored
(20 nA resolution). All HV inputs were connected through low-pass ﬁlters. The RPWELL poten-
tial (∆VRPWELL) with respect to the anode was varied throughout the experiment, while the drift
potential was kept constant ∆Vdri f t= 250 V, corresponding to a drift ﬁeld of ∼0.5 kV/cm across
the ∼5 mm conversion/drift gap. This value was chosen based on previous works [16, 18]. The
detector was installed at the CERN-SPS H2 test beam area and investigated with ∼150 GeV muons
and pions; it has been operated in three diﬀerent gas mixtures (section 2.2) at atmospheric pressure
and room temperature, at a gas ﬂow of 50-100 cc/min. No signiﬁcant gain variation was observed
at these diﬀerent ﬂow values.

2.2 Gas mixtures

A set of reference measurements were conducted with our previously employed [4, 5] "standard"
Neon mixture of Ne/(5%CH4) prior to those with Argon-based gas mixtures: Ar/(5%CH4) and
Ar/(7%CO2). The operation in Argon mixtures required higher electric ﬁelds - and therefore higher
voltages - with respect to Neon, to reach similar gains. However, Argon mixtures present two

main advantages: (1) larger average number of electron-ion pairs produced by Minimum Ionizing
Particles (MIPs); e.g in 1 cm of gas in standard conditions the numbers are 94 in Argon, and 39 in
Neon [19], allowing to use a smaller conversion/drift gap maintaining high detection eﬃciency. (2)
Argon is considerably cheaper than Neon, hence more attractive for applications requiring large-
area coverage. The use of the non-ﬂammable CO2 instead of CH4 as a photon quencher could have
some additional advantage.

2.3 Tracking, readout system and analysis framework

The experiments were carried out at the CERN-RD51 beam line. The trigger and tracking system
(based on the CERN-RD51 telescope [20]), the data acquisition system (based on the SRS/APV25
readout electronics [7, 8]) and the analysis framework were the same as in [4, 5]; they are described
in detail in [4]. The RPWELL chamber was placed along the beam line in between two tracker
elements. The global detection eﬃciency was deﬁned as the fraction of tracks matched to a pads
cluster found not more than W [mm] away from the track trajectory in both x and y directions.
The average pad multiplicity was deﬁned as the average number of pads in a matched cluster.
Only pads with charge above threshold were considered. The threshold for each pad was relative
to the channel noise and it was set using a common Zero-order Suppression Factor (ZSF) (for
details see [4]). The detector’s discharge probability was deﬁned as the number of discharges

divided by the number of hits in the active region of the detector (i.e., in the total area covered
by the crossing beam). The number of discharges was extracted directly from the power supply
log ﬁles by counting the resulting spikes in the supplied current monitor. Due to the low rate of
the muon beam, only pion runs were used to estimate the discharge probability. Since pions are
prone to induce highly-ionizing secondary events, this study yielded an upper limit of MIP-induced
discharge probability.

The detector working point was adjusted to optimize its performance, targeting high detection
eﬃciency at low pad multiplicity. The latter is a requirement for particle counting, e.g. in a potential
application of the RPWELL as a sampling element in DHCAL [21]. The optimization was done
using a set of measurements with ∼102 Hz/cm2 broad (5×5 cm2) muon beam and a ∼104 Hz/cm2
narrow (2×2 cm2) pion beam. In both cases, only tracks hitting the detector in the central 4×3 cm2
beam area were considered. To ﬁx the values of ZSF and W we followed the method described
in [4]. The optimized working points in each of the gas mixtures are summarized in table 1.

3 Results

3.1 Global and local detection eﬃciency and average pad multiplicity

The detector was operated at absolute gains of the order of 104 in the three gas mixtures. As
explained in [4], the eﬀective gain was of the order of 103. This is due to the 75 ns shaping time
of the APV25 chip, and the ∼1µs rise-time of the RPWELL signal, which results in integrating
over ∼20% of the total charge. The average numbers of MIP-induced electrons deposited in the
∼5 mm conversion/drift gap in the Neon and Argon mixtures, were 20 and 47 respectively [19].
The most probable values (MPVs) of the Landau spectra measured for the three mixtures in a
∼102 Hz/cm2 muon beam, are shown in ﬁgure 4-a as a function of ∆VRPWELL. For the same data set,
ﬁgure 4-b depicts the global detection eﬃciency values as a function of the average pad multiplicity
for diﬀerent ∆VRPWELL values. In table 2 we summarize the optimal operation voltages and the
corresponding values of global eﬃciency and average pad multiplicity. High detection eﬃciency
values (98%) at low pad multiplicity (∼1.2) were reached in all the gas mixtures investigated.
Comparing these results to that previously obtained with the smaller RPWELL detector [5], the
30 × 30 cm2 one reached optimal operation at lower potentials, due to a slightly higher gain. This
could be attributed to diﬀerences in the gas pressure and circulation during the experiment, and
possibly to small diﬀerences (within production tolerances) in the detector geometry. Another
observed diﬀerence is that for the same value of the global detection eﬃciency the larger detector
had higher average pad multiplicity than the 10 × 10 cm2 one. This was explained by the following
observations. In ﬁgure 5 we show the local average pad multiplicity values as a function of the
track distance from the pad boundary along the x and y-axis, measured in ∼102Hz/cm2 muon beam
in Ne/(5%CH4); similar results were obtained in the Argon mixtures. As expected, the local pad
multiplicity is uniform and low (∼1.1), except for a narrow region around the pad border; there,
the induced signal is shared between the two neighboring pads, resulting in local pad multiplicity
It appears that the local pad multiplicity distribution close to the pad boundary is
closer to 2.
somewhat narrower along the x-axis (ﬁgure 5-a) compared to that along the y-axis (ﬁgure 5-b).
This diﬀerence is attributed to the hexagonal pattern of THGEM holes. In this geometry, the pad
borders along the x-axis are always in front of the middle of a raw of holes, minimizing physical
charge spreading; along the y-axis, the pad boundaries are located at diﬀerent distances from the
holes centers, causing sometimes the charge of a given avalanche to spread among diﬀerent holes,
belonging to diﬀerent readout pads. A comparison of the results presented in ﬁgure 5 to similar
ones presented in [4], shows a narrower increase in the local multiplicity at the pad boundary
respect to the one of the smaller detector. This is attributed to the diﬀerent pattern of the THGEM
holes in the previous work. In [4], the holes were arranged in a square pattern with a pitch of

0.96 mm; neighboring 10×10 hole areas were separated by 0.68 mm plain Copper strips, at the
boundaries between two readout pads. A track traversing the detector in this inter-pad region is
more likely to induce charge in holes belonging to two diﬀerent pads. For this reason the local
multiplicity is relatively high farther away from the pad border. We emphasize that these results
were obtained with tracks perpendicular to the detector plane. They demonstrate the role of the
THGEM geometry in the detector performance. Further optimization is needed for improving the
performance, also based on the targeted application.

3.2 Detector performance and stability at high rates

The detector performance was investigated with low-rate muon and high rate pion beams; the latter
reaching ﬂuxes of ∼4·105 Hz/cm2. In order to maintain high detection eﬃciency at high particle
ﬂuxes, the measurements presented in this section were conducted under higher applied potential
values compared to that optimized for the detection of low-rate muons (see table 1): ∆VRPWELL was
set to 880 V, 1700 V and 1770 V in Ne/(5%CH4), Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2) respectively. For

were obtained with the Argon gas mixtures.

all gas mixtures investigated, the global detection eﬃciency was stable up to rates of ∼104Hz/cm2
(ﬁgure 6-a). The few percent eﬃciency drops at rates of ∼105Hz/cm2 are due to ∼30% gain loss
at this rate compared to the gain measured at low-rates (ﬁgure 6-b); the loss in pulse-height can be
attributed to charging up of the insulator within the holes and avalanche build-up limitations on the
resistive anode (see for example [22]). These results are in agreement with that previously shown
in [5] for the 10 × 10 cm2 RPWELL detector. If necessary, the eﬃciency drop can be partially
mitigated using higher operation potentials. Only part of the eﬃciency lost can be recovered in this
way, because a higher detector gain causes more charge to ﬂow through the resistive layer and to
charge up the insulator. In recent tests with a similar detector we veriﬁed this limitation, and we are
now trying to quantify the eﬀect. The stability of the detector gain was investigated in the three gas
mixtures, at pion ﬂuxes of 104-105 Hz/cm2; the results, in terms of the MPV as a function of time,
are shown in Figure 7-a. No signiﬁcant gain variations were observed along ∼1 hour of operation
in all gas mixtures investigated.

The same measurement was used to estimate the discharge probability. No discharges were
observed when the detector was operated with Ne/(5%CH4) and irradiated with >108 pions; there-
fore the resulting value of 10−8 is an upper limit for the discharge probability in this gas mix-
ture.
In Argon based mixtures instead, under the considerably higher operation potentials, we
observed sporadic discharges, as shown for example in ﬁgure 7-b, during the measurement in
Ar/(5%CH4). Note that such discharges were not observed under similar operation conditions
in our 10 × 10 cm2 detector prototype [5]; also, since discharges were recorded also in segments
located outside the beam area, we presume that they are most likely related to "weak points" in
our modular detector prototype design: an open path along the support pins, leading to discharges

is supported by the sharp increase in the discharge probability measured when the rubber o-rings
around each pin were absent (not presented here). This defect will be taken care of in future de-
signs.

under diﬀerent pion rates, as a function of time; measured with a sensitive ammeter [23]. Similar
results were obtained in all three gas mixtures. As expected, the small current spikes, correspond-
ing to the beam spill structure, grow smoothly in amplitude with the particle rate. For all the rates
investigated, the measured current is in agreement with the eﬀective gain measured (ﬁgure 6-b);
I = q · n · Φ · G(Φ), where I is the current, q is the electron charge, n is the number of electron-ion
pairs produced by a minimum ionizing particle in 5 mm of Argon [19], Φ is the particle rate and G
the detector gain (which depends on Φ as explained above).6

4 Summary and discussion

A 30 × 30 cm2 RPWELL detector prototype with a Semitron(cid:114) ESD225 resistive plate was assem-
bled and tested. This thin, single-stage detector was operated with Ne/(5%CH4) and with cost-
eﬀective Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2) gas mixtures, at variable muon and pion ﬂuxes. The oper-
ation in Argon mixtures would also permit having thinner drift gaps, possibly resulting in smaller
inter-pad multiplicities under inclined incidence. Its performance was compared with the one ob-
tained with a 10 × 10 cm2 prototype [5]. Both prototypes demonstrated high detection eﬃciency
(>98%) at low average pad multiplicity (∼1.2) in all three gas mixtures. The detection eﬃciency
remained stable when the detector was exposed to particle ﬂuxes up to 104Hz/cm2 and dropped
by few percent at 105Hz/cm2. The current ﬂowing through the detector anode increased with in-
creasing particle ﬂux and had no abnormal variations, indicating stable detector operation. The

boundary, compared to that measured with a THGEM of a square hole-pattern [5]. This, however,
did not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the average pad multiplicity. This performance of the RPWELL detector
is compatible with the requirements imposed for future digital hadron calorimetry; moreover, it is
comparable or superior to that of other technologies suggested in this context (for example RPC,
GEM, MICROMEGAS). A detailed comparison can be found in [5]. Discharge-free operation sim-
ilar to the one shown in [5] for the 10 × 10 cm2 prototype was demonstrated in Ne/(5%CH4) gas
mixture; occasional discharges were however observed in Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2)- asso-
ciated with the support pins in the present design. Consequently, a diﬀerent design is currently
being implemented in a new 50 × 50 cm2 detector prototype. The RPWELL concept is expected to
pave ways towards various applications necessitating the deployment of robust large-area particle-
