Abstract On the 29 March 2014 NOAA active region (AR) 12017 produced
an X1 ﬂare which was simultaneously observed by an unprecedented number
of observatories. We have investigated the pre-ﬂare period of this ﬂare from
14:00 UT until 19:00 UT using joint observations made by the Interface Re-
gion Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) and the Hinode Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS). Spectral lines providing coverage of the solar atmosphere
from chromosphere to the corona were analysed to investigate pre-ﬂare activity
within the AR. The results of the investigation have revealed evidence of strongly
blue-shifted plasma ﬂows, with velocities up to 200 km s−1, being observed 40
minutes prior to ﬂaring. These ﬂows are located along the ﬁlament present in the
active region and are both spatially discrete and transient. In order to constrain
the possible explanations for this activity, we undertake non-potential magnetic
ﬁeld modelling of the active region. This modelling indicates the existence of a
weakly twisted ﬂux rope along the polarity inversion line in the region where a
ﬁlament and the strong pre-ﬂare ﬂows are observed. We then discuss how these
observations relate to the current models of ﬂare triggering. We conclude that
the most likely drivers of the observed activity are internal reconnection in the
ﬂux rope, early onset of the ﬂare reconnection, or tether cutting reconnection
along the ﬁlament.

1. Introduction

The dynamic magnetic environment of the solar atmosphere can lead to the stor-
age of a large quantity of magnetic energy. This energy can be released via waves
or magnetic reconnection, where the rapid energy release and its observational
eﬀects are manifested as a solar ﬂare. Models of solar ﬂare occurrence, such as
the 2D CSHKP model (Carmichael, 1964; Sturrock, 1966; Hirayama, 1974; Kopp
and Pneuman, 1976) and the recent 3D model (Janvier et al., 2014), describe
the ﬂaring process and associated physical eﬀects but make little or no mention
of the trigger mechanism. Recent work has identiﬁed several mechanisms and
observational eﬀects that could signify the ﬂare trigger, but as yet a deﬁnitive
trigger model has not been forthcoming.

Prior to ﬂare onset,“free” magnetic energy must be built up in the active
region. This energy build up can occur in a number of ways. Heyvaerts, Priest,
and Rust (1977) suggested that the emergence of magnetic ﬂux from below the
solar surface could introduce new magnetic energy into an active region. This
newly emerged ﬂux can then interact with existing magnetic ﬁeld in the solar
atmosphere, resulting in the triggering of solar ﬂares (see Priest (2014) and refer-
ences therein). Observational evidence for ﬂux emergence comes through the use
of magnetograms (both line-of-sight and vector). Solar ﬂares are predominantly
observed to occur at sites of strong magnetic ﬁeld gradient. At these polarity
inversion lines (PILs), energy can be built up in the ﬁeld lines linking the two
polarity regions through a shearing process. Shearing can be brought about by
the rotation of sunspots (e.g., Sundara Raman, Selvendran, and Thiagarajan,
1998), which can drag one polarity along the point of contact with the opposite
polarity region. As rotation continues, shear increases, leading to a build-up of
magnetic energy and eventually to reconnection resulting in a solar ﬂare.

Once energy has built up in the system, several scenarios have been pro-
posed for the initiation of large scale energy release. Tether-cutting reconnection
(Moore and Labonte, 1980; Moore et al., 2001) is one such model of the initiation
of ﬂare and coronal mass ejection (CME) activity. This model proposes that slow
reconnection can occur at the foot-points of a sheared loop system, resulting in
the weakening of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld. This weakening of the overlying
ﬁeld allows the ﬁlament that is supported by the sheared loop system to rise,
in what is called the slow rise phase. At some point during the rise, the system
becomes torus unstable and at the same time a current sheet forms beneath
the rising structure. Reconnection occurs in the current sheet, accelerating the
ﬁlament in the fast-rise phase and causing ﬂaring. This relationship between
tether cutting reconnection and the slow and fast rise phases of an eruption are
supported by observational studies such as those by Chifor et al. (2006; 2007). In
contrast to tether-cutting, Antiochos, DeVore, and Klimchuk (1999) presented
the breakout model of ﬂare/CME triggering. This model involves reconnection
occurring above a sheared arcade at a magnetic null-point created between the
arcade and overlying ﬁeld. This reconnection weakens the overlying ﬁeld and
allows the eruption of magnetic ﬂux from the centre of the arcade. Intensity
enhancements during the pre-ﬂare period such as those observed by Warren and
Warshall (2001) away from the site of ﬂaring have been linked to the breakout
model.

Pre-ﬂare Observations and Modelling

The activation of the ﬁlament in an active region has also been linked to
the occurrence of ﬂaring. Rubio da Costa et al. (2012) discussed how small
scale reconnection within a ﬁlament leads to its destabilisation and subsequent
ﬂaring and eruption. Recent 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation work
by Kusano et al. (2012) has identiﬁed small magnetic disturbances occurring
near the PIL that may be a candidate for a ﬂare trigger. A follow up study
by Bamba et al. (2013) investigated these disturbances, and the small scale
internal reconnection that they cause, through observation of Ca ii h emission
line intensity enhancements.

Plasma instabilities are another possible way in which ﬂaring can be triggered.
T¨or¨ok and Kliem (2005) used MHD simulations to propose a model of solar
eruptions triggered by the helical kink instability. This instability is triggered
when twist in a magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) exceeds a critical value and causes the
MFR to kink and rise upwards. There have been observations that support this
model, such as Williams et al. (2009) who observed asymmetric Doppler shifts
along a ﬁlament prior to eruption which they interpreted as a MFR subjected
to the eﬀects of the kink instability. Kliem and T¨or¨ok (2006) proposed a further
plasma instability as a trigger mechanism, the torus instability. In this model,
if the Lorentz force provided by an external magnetic ﬁeld decreases faster than
the hoop force exerted by an expanding current ring embedded in the external
ﬁeld, the system will be unstable. These instabilities can then rapidly cause the
current ring to rise, triggering an eruption. Authors such as Zuccarello et al.
(2014) have provided observational evidence for the role of torus instabilities in
triggering eruptions.

The trigger mechanisms discussed thus far have clearly deﬁned observational
signatures. There are however pre-ﬂare features that have been identiﬁed that are
not yet associated with a speciﬁc ﬂare trigger model. Non-thermal velocity (Vnt)
enhancements have been identiﬁed up to an hour prior to ﬂares in X-rays by
Doschek et al. (1980), and tens of minutes prior by Harra, Matthews, and Cul-
hane (2001). In EUV wavelengths Harra et al. (2009) and Wallace et al. (2010)
observed Vnt enhancements over an hour before ﬂare occurrence, and Harra
et al. (2013) related this type of enhancement to sites of coronal dimming. They
also suggested that these enhancements could be another indicator of ﬁlament
activation prior to ﬂaring.

The X-class ﬂare of 29 March 2014 has been a source of intense study by many
authors, due to the quality and variety of data available (e.g. Judge et al., 2014;
Matthews et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Battaglia et al., 2015; Young, Tian, and
Jaeggli, 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Aschwanden, 2015; Kleint et al., 2016; Rubio da
Costa et al., 2016). There have been studies investigating aspects of the pre-ﬂare
period of this ﬂare. Abramov-Maximov et al. (2015) carried out microwave and
radio observations of the active region that produced the X-ﬂare, following the
evolution of the region from its appearance on disk until ﬂaring. Yang, Guo, and
Ding (2016) used vector magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations to investigate the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration in the active region between 28 and 29 March 2014. This work
identiﬁed the presence of a magnetic ﬂux rope in this region and suggested that
the majority of the ﬂares during their period of study were triggered by the
kink instability. Kleint et al. (2015) studied the ﬁlament eruption of this ﬂare in

Hinode/EIS and IRIS coverage starts at 14:09 UT. The ﬂare at 14:30 UT occurs outside the
spectrometer ﬁeld of view. At 16:24 UT a C 1.1 ﬂare was observed by both spectrometers,
followed by the X 1 ﬂare at the peak time of 17:48 UT.

detail, ﬁnding that the ﬁlament exhibited accelerations of ≈3 - 5 km s−2 during
the eruption. They also identiﬁed small Doppler shifts (velocities of 2 – 4 km s−1)
along the ﬁlament up to an hour prior to the ﬂare observed by the Interferometric
BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS), which they attributed to either plasma ﬂows
or the slow rise of the ﬁlament.

Whilst these previous studies investigated aspects of the pre-ﬂare behaviour
of this ﬂare, none carried out a dedicated spectroscopic investigation of pre-ﬂare
activity. We therefore present the ﬁrst spectroscopic study of pre-ﬂare activ-
ity to simultaneously observe the chromosphere, transition region and corona
using data from Hinode/EIS and IRIS spectrometers. Section 2 provides an
overview of the observations. We present the ﬁndings of these observations in
Section 3, including the identiﬁcation of transient, strongly blue-shifted features,
characterised by transition region velocities of up to 200 km s−1 measured in
emission line wings. These features are determined to be plasma ﬂows and seen
up to ≈40 minutes prior to ﬂare onset. We discuss how these features relate to
extended bright features observed alongside the ﬁlament in the run up to the
ﬂare. The results of non-potential magnetic ﬁeld modelling of the active region
are presented, revealing the presence of a magnetic ﬂux rope. Section 4 contains
discussion of the results and how they may relate to current models of ﬂare
triggering.

2. Observations

Beginning at SOL2014-03-29T17:35, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) active region (AR) 12017 produced an X1 ﬂare. This
ﬂare was observed by an unprecedented number of observatories, both space and
ground based. Figure 1 shows the GOES soft X-ray light curve from 14:00 UT,
with the times of relevant events marked.

The Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al., 2007)
onboard the Hinode spacecraft (Kosugi et al., 2007) was observing AR 12017

Pre-ﬂare Observations and Modelling

Figure 2. Panel (a) shows the ﬁelds of view of the IRIS (blue) and Hinode/textrmEIS (red)
spectrometers overlayed onto the active region seen in the 193 ˚A AIA channel, presented with
an inverted colour table. All images have been diﬀerentially rotated to the time of the closest
AIA 193 ˚A exposure at the time of the central Hinode/EIS raster step. Panel (b) shows the
three regions of study and their positions within the Hinode/EIS Fe xii ﬁeld of view. The
position of the ﬁlament is clearly seen in the 193 ˚A and 304 ˚A AIA channels, with panel (c)

continuously from 14:05 – 17:57 UT. During this time 104 rasters of the ﬁeld of
view were produced with a cadence of 134 s. The observing program makes use
of the 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit rastering across a ﬁeld of view of 42(cid:48)(cid:48) × 120(cid:48)(cid:48) in 4(cid:48)(cid:48) steps (shown
in red in Figure 2, panel (a)). Eight spectral windows are contained within the
observing program, of which Fe xii 192.39˚A and He ii 256.28˚A are selected for
analysis. Fe xii is selected as it is the strongest coronal line observed by EIS
providing the best opportunity of identifying low intensity pre-ﬂare activity.

He ii was chosen to study the lower atmosphere due to its pseudo-chromospheric
nature.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS; De Pontieu et al., 2014)
was observing AR 12017 from 14:09 – 17:54 UT with a ﬁeld of view of 14(cid:48)(cid:48) × 174(cid:48)(cid:48),
produced using an eight step raster of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) steps (highlighted in blue in Figure 2,
panel (a)). Although nominal exposures were 8 seconds, automatic exposure
control was in eﬀect during rasters covering the peak of the X-ﬂare, reducing the
exposure time to ≈2 seconds. These exposure times result in a raster cadence of
72 s. IRIS also utilises a slit jaw imager (SJI) to provide context to spectroscopic
observations.

Data from NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson,
and Chamberlin, 2012) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instruments were downloaded with calibrations and
corrections already applied. The routine aia prep was run on the data before
use to account for small scaling diﬀerences between the full disk images produced
by both instruments.

In order to directly compare spatial locations between the four data sets used
in this analysis, Hinode/EIS and IRIS images are aligned with AIA images. This
alignment is done manually using feature recognition of the corresponding AIA
wavelength to the chosen Hinode/EIS or IRIS data. To do this, Hinode/EIS
Fe xii 192.6 ˚A data are aligned to AIA 193 ˚A data for each time step, while for
the IRIS alignment, Si iv 1400 ˚A observations are aligned to the AIA 1600 ˚A
channel. The alignment by feature recognition requires only very small changes
to position, of no more than ±2 arcseconds for each individual raster.

3. Results

3.1. Active Region Evolution

AR 12017 was ﬁrst observed crossing the eastern limb of the Sun on 22-March-
2014. The evolution of this active region from 22 March 2014 to 29 March 2014
was discussed in Abramov-Maximov et al. (2015). They showed that there is
a large negative polarity sunspot leading the AR with smaller less coherent
positive polarity trailing until 27 March 2014 when a new positive polarity region
emerges next to the leading negative polarity. This is illustrated in Figure 3,
which shows the evolution of the central portion of the active region. Panel (a)
displays the initial morphology, with the clear large negative sunspot. In panel
(b), we observe the emergence of the positive polarity region. Panels (c) – (f) show
the evolution of this emergence and its subsequent interaction with the existing
negative polarity. It is interesting to note that as this interaction progresses, the
apparent motion of the positive polarity with respect to the polarity inversion
line (PIL) indicates an increase in shear of the magnetic ﬁeld. Panel (f) shows
the AR just after the peak of the X-class ﬂare. We see that the ﬁeld has become
sheared over the PIL, suggesting that there has been a large build up of magnetic
energy in this region.

Pre-ﬂare Observations and Modelling

Figure 3. Evolution of the central portion of AR 12017 between 26 March 2014 and 29 March
2014. Flux emergence is observed in panel (b), and subsequent panels show the formation of
a highly sheared polarity inversion line. Plots are scaled between ±550 Gauss. Panel (e) also
indicates the AIA ﬁeld of view used in Figure 2, marked by the red shaded area, as well as the
three regions of study.

Within the AR on 29 March 2014, there is a clearly visible ﬁlament. This
feature can be seen clearly in the AIA 193 ˚A observations in Figure 2, panels (c)
and (d). The path of the ﬁlament can also be clearly seen in the Hα observations
presented in Figure 5 of Kleint et al. (2015).

3.2. Pre-Flare Observations in the Corona

Previous studies of pre-ﬂare behaviour have found enhanced Vnt features ob-
served in the corona over periods of tens of minutes to an hour prior to ﬂare
onset, suggesting increased Vnt may be an indicator of imminent ﬂare onset
(Harra et al., 2009). In order to investigate whether this phenomenon was ob-
served prior to the 29 March 2014 X-ﬂare, Fe xii 192.3 ˚A observations from
Hinode/EIS are analysed. These data are ﬁtted with single Gaussian proﬁles.
Due to the lack of absolute wavelength calibration in Hinode/EIS data, care is
taken to determine a rest wavelength. This is done by selecting a small area of
the ﬁeld of view from a pre-ﬂare raster, in which little activity is observed and
ﬁtting to determine the rest wavelength. The raster chosen for this purpose is
the ﬁrst in the data set, recorded at 15:01:09 UT. Values for Doppler velocity
and Vnt are determined from the results of the spectral ﬁtting. Doppler velocity
is determined by measuring the deviation of line centre from the rest velocity,
while Vnt is deﬁned as the width of a line observed above that of the theoretical
thermal line width for the given ion under observation.

Figure 4 shows time proﬁles of mean intensity (red) and mean Vnt (blue) for
three chosen subregions: A, B and C. This method of investigating the behaviour
using Vnt averaged over a small region is similar to that employed in earlier
coronal studies of pre-ﬂare activity (e.g. Harra et al., 2009; Harra et al., 2013).
Region A is chosen as it is the site of the conﬁned C-class ﬂare that occurred at
16:24 UT. From Figure 4 panel (a), we see that the intensity and Vnt time proﬁles

match closely, both exhibiting a strong peak during the C-class ﬂare. This region
of Vnt enhancement is clearly seen in panel (a) of Figure 5, where Fe xii Vnt
contours are overlayed onto AIA 193 ˚A images at the peak of the C-ﬂare. The
time proﬁle of Region B (Figure 4, panel (b)) shows little activity early in the
observations as this region is uninvolved in the C-ﬂare at 16:24 UT. However,
at ≈17:00 UT there is a clear spike in the mean Vnt for Region B, accompanied
by a small increase above the mean intensity. The peak mean Vnt observed in
Region B is over 70 km s−1. This is a signiﬁcant value for an active region at
a time when no ﬂaring activity is occurring. Testa, De Pontieu, and Hansteen
(2016) have found Vnt values in non-ﬂaring active regions to be 24 km s−1, as
determined from the Fe xii 1349.4 ˚A emission line. It can be clearly seen in panel
(b) of Figure 5 that this small section of Vnt enhancement is located directly over
the area of the active region where the ﬁlament is situated. From the Doppler
velocity data, this feature ia identiﬁed as having a line-centre blue-shift of tens
of km s−1. The time proﬁle of Region C (Figure 4, panel (c)) is again diﬀerent to
that seen in the other regions. At 16:24 UT there is a small response to the C 1.1
ﬂare seen in both intensity and Vnt. This lesser response to the C-ﬂare in this
region results from the eﬀects of the ﬂare only being present in a small subregion
which is common to both Regions A and C. Region C also shows intriguing
activity from ≈16:45 UT to 17:00 UT, both in intensity and Vnt. The intensity
proﬁle during this period exhibits three periodic peaks, each with a higher peak
intensity than the previous. This periodic increase in intensity is accompanied
by a general increase in Vnt. At ≈17:17 UT there is a peak in intensity and Vnt.
The onset of the X-class ﬂare is seen in Region C from ≈17:28 UT with clear
and sustained increases in intensity and Vnt. These eﬀects of the X-ﬂare are
seen in Region C up to ﬁve minutes prior to similar eﬀects in Regions A and B.
Vnt enhancements at the start of the X-ﬂare (17:35 UT) can be seen in panel
(c) of Figure 5. Having found sources of enhanced coronal Vnt, we explore the
behaviour of the lower atmosphere at the pixel scale.

3.3. Response of the lower atmosphere

The response of the lower atmosphere in these regions is also investigated to fully
understand pre-ﬂare activity throughout the solar atmosphere. The transition
region response is investigated via the Si iv line at 1402.77 ˚A observed by IRIS.
The pseudo-chromospheric He ii 256.2 ˚A observed by EIS and the optically thick
chromospheric Mg ii h and k lines (at 2803.52 ˚A and 2796.34 ˚A respectively)
observed by IRIS are chosen to investigate the atmosphere to chromospheric
depths. To investigate the dynamics in these regions, the evolution of the proﬁles
of each spectral line is studied between 16:16 UT and 18:00 UT. The data for
each line proﬁle sequence are plotted as a function of time and Doppler velocity,
centred on the rest velocity of each individual line. These rest velocities are
calculated by ﬁtting a small, inactive area of a pre-ﬂare raster. The following is
an account of the pre-ﬂare activity observed for each sub-region in turn.

3.3.1. Region A: Site of C-class Flare

In Region A (Figure 4, panel (a)), the intensity and Vnt proﬁles track each other
closely, both exhibiting a strong peak during the C1.1 ﬂare at 16:24 UT. Figure 6

Pre-ﬂare Observations and Modelling

Figure 4. Evolution of mean intensity (red) and mean Vnt (blue) calculated for Fe xii, in time
for Regions A, B and C, as shown in Figure 2. In Region A, shown in panel (a), the two
proﬁles broadly match, in particular showing a clear peak during the 16:24 UT C1.1 ﬂare. The
location of Vnt enhancement during the C-ﬂare is shown in Figure 5 panel (a). In Region B,
panel (b), we can see that at 17:00 UT, non-thermal velocity peaks at a value of ≈70 km s−1.
This non-thermal velocity peak occurs in the absence of a corresponding intensity increase.
The location of this region of Vnt enhancement is shown in Figure 5 panel (b). Region C, panel
(c): both intensity and non-thermal velocity proﬁles match well, with no irregularities as in
the case of Region B. A smaller response to the C1.1 ﬂare is observed in this region. Prior to
17:00 UT increases in intensity and non-thermal velocity are observed. Region C also exhibits
the earliest response to the X ﬂare of the three regions studied. Figure 5 panel (c) shows the
location of non-thermal velocity enhancements

illustrates the He ii, Si iv and Mg ii k line proﬁle evolution for Region A. We
clearly see in the He ii spectra the increase in intensity and line width due to the
C1.1 ﬂare at 16:24 UT, as well as lesser dynamics in both lines up until the onset
of the X-ﬂare at 17:35. Both He ii and Si iv spectra show a strongly blue-shifted
feature at ≈17:40 UT, which we interpret as the eruption of the ﬁlament during
the X-ﬂare. The Mg ii k emission is observed to have strong intensity and a weak
central reversal in its proﬁle from the onset of the C-ﬂare until ≈16:50 UT. At
this point in time the central reversal deepens and the line intensity is weaker
on the whole. As in the case of He ii and Si iv, strong blue asymmetries are seen
in the Mg ii data at ≈17:40 UT. Thus within Region A, we observe a similar
response to the C-ﬂare throughout the atmosphere, noting that the activity is
in line with that expected for an area of study such as this.

3.3.2. Region B: Site of Pre-Flare Vnt Enhancement

Region B is chosen for further study due to an intriguing Vnt feature observed
at 17:00 UT. Figure 7 shows the evolution of the He ii, Si iv and Mg ii k line
proﬁles in Region B. As expected there is no observed activity during the C1.1
ﬂare as this is conﬁned solely to Region A. From the start of observation until
≈16:50 UT, the spectra show ordinary active region dynamics with little to no
line broadening or Doppler shifts. From ≈16:50 UT however, strong blue shifts

lines. Additionally, these strong blue shifts are observed to be very dynamic,
reaching a maximum around 16:54 UT, falling at 17:00 UT, and then reaching
200 km s−1 from 17:04 UT. This behaviour is very interesting as peak coronal
blue shifts, determined from Fe xii data, are observed at 17:00 UT, suggesting
there is a temporal oﬀset between the layers of the atmosphere involved in the
activity. After these peak blue shifts, the line proﬁles continue to be dynamic
until the onset of the X-ﬂare, albeit exhibiting blue shifts of lesser velocities of
up to ≈100 km s−1. Within this region, we identify increased Vnt from coronal
Fe xii data, as well as strong blue-shifted ﬂows in the lower atmosphere which
initiate very rapidly.

3.3.3. Region C: Site of Pre-Flare Brightening and Earliest Response to X-ﬂare

Region C is chosen as it is the site of a pre-ﬂare brightening observed in AIA
193 ˚A data. The single pixel time proﬁles obtained in Region C, Figure 8, diﬀer
again from those observed in Regions A and B. Little activity or line broadening
is observed in Si iv and Mg ii k spectra prior to ≈16:45 UT. The He ii time proﬁle
shows a response to the C-ﬂare at 16:24 UT and in general shows more activity
than the other lines studied during this time period. From 16:45 UT until the
onset of the X-class ﬂare at 17:35 UT, this activity is characterised by increased
line intensity, especially in Si iv observations, as well as strong, intermittent blue
asymmetries in all observed lines. These blue asymmetries have speeds between

as dramatic as that in Region B, but dynamic blue shifts of up to 200 km s−1
are observed.

3.4. Location of Observed Plasma Flows

From examination of the line proﬁles we determine that from ≈16:50 UT the
plasma is highly dynamic. As these line proﬁles represent the evolution of the
spectra at one pixel in time, we must also consider the morphology of these ﬂows
and their evolution over the whole ﬁeld of view. Figure 9 shows four AIA 193 ˚A
images charting the activity along the ﬁlament. In panel (a) we see the ﬁlament at
16:42 UT and note that there is little activity seen in the areas corresponding to
Regions A, B and C (positions are shown in the marked boxes). Panel (b) shows
a bright feature appearing within Region C, lying directly to the south of the
ﬁlament, at around 16:54 UT. By 17:00 UT (panel (c); the time of peak coronal
blue shift as measured by Hinode/EIS), we can see that a bright loop now lies
across the ﬁlament, within Region B. This loop is situated directly above the site
of the blue shifts observed by Hinode/EIS and IRIS. Additionally, in both panels
(c) and (d) an elongated bright feature extends from this loop west to the site of
the initial brightening observed in panel (b). The path of this feature is marked
by the black arrows in panel (d). In Figure 10 we show for similar time selections

area of strong blue shift is seen to appear in the region of increased intensity at
16:54 UT, along with a weaker blue-shifted feature in the centre of the ﬁlament,
shown in panel (b). Panel (c) shows that at 17:00 UT this blue-shifted region
is still present, along with a second strongly blue-shifted region in the centre of
the ﬁlament. Panel (d) of Figure 10 shows that at 17:04:54 UT the blue shifts
in the corona seem to extend from the two regions identiﬁed earlier, along the
extended bright feature. Figure 11 details the morphology of the −100 km s−1
blue shifts observed in the Si iv data, overlaid onto the AIA 193 ˚A images. Panel
(a) reveals that at 16:42 UT, blue shifts in the region of the earlier C-class ﬂare.
At 16:54 UT (panel (b)), blue shifts are still present at the site of the C-class ﬂare
but to a lesser extent. In the region of the bright feature in the AIA 193 ˚A image,
strong blue shifts are also observed. These blue shifts are in the same positions
as those identiﬁed during the same time period from Fe xii data. Additional blue
shifts are also observed along the ﬁlament at this point in time. In panel (c),
we ﬁnd that the blue shifts associated with the bright feature are still present.
Blue shifts are also observed to lie along the bright ribbon-like feature to the
south of the ﬁlament. It is noted that these blue shifts are spatially discrete. The
situation seen in panel (d) at 17:04 UT is similar to that observed at 17:00 UT.

Figure 10. Here we see the same AIA 193 ˚A (colour table inverted) ﬁeld of view as Figure 9,
over-plotted with Hinode/EIS Fe xii data at −100 km s−1. No strong blue shifts can be seen
in the EIS data in panel (a) at 16:42 UT. By 16:55 UT (panel (b)) we can see that there
is a strong area of blue shift located over a bright region in the AIA data. There is also a
less intense region of blue shift located in the centre of the ﬁlament. At 17:00 UT (panel (c))
both these blue-shifted regions have increased in intensity. Panel (b) shows the situation at
17:04 UT where the strong blue shifts have dissipated greatly with the feature in the centre of
the ﬁlament being no longer visible.

However, the positions of the spatially discrete blue shifts along the extended
bright feature have changed, highlighting the transient nature of these features.
This behaviour is seen more clearly in the movie of this time period (Movie 1)
in the online version.

The fast plasma ﬂows and brightenings, observed throughout the solar atmo-
sphere and discussed in the preceding sections are clear examples of pre-ﬂare
activity. However several diﬀering models could be used to explain such activity.
In order to attempt to conﬁne the possible drivers, non-potential magnetic ﬁeld
modelling is carried out on the active region. This work and its results are
described in Section 3.5.

3.5. Non-potential Magnetic Field Modelling

To simulate the non-potential evolution of the active region magnetic ﬁeld and
the morphology of the magnetic ﬁeld at the ﬁlament location, a continuous
time-series of quasi-static, nonlinear force-free ﬁelds are produced. These non-
potential magnetic ﬁelds are produced using the technique developed and applied
in Mackay, Green, and van Ballegooijen (2011) and Gibb et al. (2014). In this
technique, the boundary driving at the level of the photosphere is obtained

Figure 11. For the same region detailed in Figures 8 and 9, this Figure displays Si iv emission
at −100 km s−1 observed by IRIS, overlayed onto AIA 193 ˚A data (colour table inverted). In
panel (a), at 16:42 UT, we see a blue-shifted region centred on the region of the earlier C-class
ﬂare. In panel (b), 16:54 UT, blue shifts in the region of the C-ﬂare have waned in intensity.
In the region of brightening in the AIA data there is a region of strong blue shift, as well
as discrete areas of blue shift extending along the ﬁlament. At 17:00 UT, panel (c), these
discrete blue shift features are located along the extended bright feature visible in AIA data.
By 17:04 UT, panel (d), blue shifts have decreased in intensity, but are still present along the

directly from a time series of HMI line-of-sight magnetograms which are directly
applied as lower boundary conditions. The coronal magnetic ﬁeld then responds
to these motions by evolving through a continuous series of quasi-static nonlinear
force-free ﬁelds using the magneto-frictional relaxation method. Full details of
the equations solved and the technical details of applying this technique to
magnetogram data are described in the cited papers.

The time period of the simulation ranges from 16:30:31 UT on 27 March 2014
to 19:30:31 UT on 29 March 2014 where the cadence of the magnetograms is
taken to be 90 minutes. This time period is fully illustrated in Figure 3 where
a selection of the magnetograms can be seen. From these panels it is clear that
the area of interest is dominated by negative ﬂux. While this is the case, from
around 19:30:31 UT on 27 March 2014 a new positive polarity of a bipole begins
to appear and then grows strongly over the next two days. The variation of
the total ﬂux (solid line), unsigned negative ﬂux (dotted line) and positive ﬂux
(dashed line) are seen in Figure 12 panel (a). From this plot it can be seen
that both the positive and negative ﬂux increase over time, characterised by
the emergence of new ﬂux. The numerical simulations of this active region are
carried out in a computational box of 5123 grid points. Closed side boundary

boundary conditions are used. Use of the open top boundary condition means
that no correction for ﬂux balancing is required at the modelled photosphere.
For use in the model, the time series of full disk magnetograms are de-rotated to
disk center and a portion of size 300 × 210 pixels is extracted and then centered
at the lower boundary in the computational box. The normal ﬁeld component on
all computational grid points outside of the area on the magnetogram are set to
zero. A potential magnetic ﬁeld is then constructed from the initial magnetogram
(Figure 12 panel (b)). Due to the dominance of negative ﬂux approximately 90%
of the ﬂux is open.

rations produce a strongly sheared magnetic ﬁeld along the PIL at the correct
location or time that is representative of the ﬁeld of a ﬁlament. Thus from
this we ﬁnd that for the present case the horizontal motions deduced from the
magnetograms do not inject enough non-potentiality or helicity into the coronal
ﬁeld to produce a strongly sheared magnetic ﬁeld at the observed position of the
ﬁlament.

To investigate the possible origin of the strongly sheared non-potential mag-
netic structure of the ﬁlament a second series of simulations are carried out where
an additional injection of helicity is included at the photosphere. This is included
through the addition of Equation (A1) from the paper of Mackay, DeVore, and
Antiochos (2014). Inclusion of this term allows for the injection of either positive
or negative helicity at the photosphere without changing the normal magnetic
ﬁeld. Figure 13 panel (b) shows the ﬁeld lines at 09:30:31 UT on 28 March 2014
when an average relative helicity density of 5 × 1016 Mx2cm−2s−1 is injected
into the corona throughout the simulation. It is clear that with this additional
helicity injection the ﬁeld lines now exhibit a strong shear that is directed to
the left (sinistral) when standing on the positive polarity side of the PIL. This
strong shear along the PIL continues to build such that at 00:00:31 UT on 29
March 2014 (Figure 13 panel d) there is an arcade lying directly along the PIL
which then evolves into a magnetic ﬂux rope by 16:30:31 UT on 29 March 2014
(Figure 13 panel (f)). Figure 13 panel (g) shows a side view of the ﬁeld lines
in Figure 13 panel (f) where the ﬁnal ﬂux rope structure has approximately
one turn along its length. Both the sign of helicity injection and chirality of the
ﬁlament are of the dominant type found for the southern hemisphere.

To produce a magnetic structure that is consistent with the ﬁlament at the
correct time and location an additional form of injection of magnetic helicity is
required. Through carrying out a number of additional simulations with a variety
of rates we ﬁnd that the helicity density injection rate has to be between 3.75 −
5 × 1016 Mx2cm−2s−1 to reproduce the magnetic structure of the ﬁlament. It is
important to point out that for the present simulations with open top boundary
conditions, where initially over 90% of the ﬂux is open, the majority of this
injected helicity is lost through the top boundary. The exact physical injection
mechanism of this helicity at the present time is unknown. However since ﬂux
emergence is an important part of the evolution of the active region over the
time period considered, one possible scenario for its origin is the transport of
magnetic twist from the interior of the Sun to the atmosphere. While we only
show results for a single box size, start time and initial condition, all three have
been varied with and without additional helicity injection. In all cases similar
results are found since the main magnetic feature of interest always emerges after
the initial condition is constructed and as such is treated the same no matter the
box size or initial condition used. While the present text gives a brief description
of the results a future study will consider this in more detail along with a full
description of the quantities calculated.

From this modelling we determine the behaviour of the magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration in the active region leading up to the X-class ﬂare. The presence
and qualities of the magnetic ﬂux rope revealed along the PIL, considered in
conjunction with our observational results allow further conclusions to be drawn
about the origin of the observed activity.

4. Discussion

The pre-ﬂare period of the 29 March 2014 X-class ﬂare shows very dynamic
phenomena occurring in multiple layers of the solar atmosphere. This activity is
observed in both spectroscopic and imaging data.

Up to 40 minutes prior to ﬂare onset, blue shifts are observed in multiple
spectral emission lines by both IRIS and Hinode/EIS in two of the three sub-
regions (Regions B and C) of study chosen. The ﬁrst of these areas, Region B,
is located on the ﬁlament seen in AIA and IRIS SJI data. Region B is also the
site of non-thermal line widths of 70 km s−1, observed in the coronal Fe xii line.
The plasma exhibiting this enhanced non-thermal velocity is also found to be
blue-shifted.

As detailed in Section 3.3 and shown in Figure 7, within this region we observe
strongly blue-shifted Si iv, and He ii emissions of up to 200 km s−1. These emis-
sions are also highly transient, with velocities peaking at 16:54 UT and 17:04 UT
whilst falling to lower values at 17:00 UT. As earlier noted this presents an
interesting oﬀset between the times of peak blue shift occurring in the lower
atmosphere and the corona where blue shifts are at a maximum at 17:00 UT.
This oﬀset could be caused, for example, by the propagation of plasma through
the atmosphere or be the result of two separate but related phenomena e.g. small
scale reconnection at diﬀerent heights in the atmosphere.

Region C also exhibits these strong transient blue shifts in Si iv and He ii
data. As in the case of Region B, little activity is observed in these lines until
≈16:45 UT. After this time 200 km s−1 blue shifts are observed until the onset of
the X-ﬂare. These blue shifts are very transient, particularly so in the Si iv line
proﬁles, where they “switch on and oﬀ” during the 40 minutes prior to the ﬂare
at irregular intervals. This activity suggests that the process causing these ﬂows
is not constant. In both these regions the chromospheric response as determined
by the Mg ii observations suggests that something is driving line broadening,
particularly towards shorter wavelengths. However due to the complex nature
of the chromospheric lines, it is not a simple matter to say that these blue
asymmetries are indicative of upﬂows. This eﬀect is discussed in detail in Kuridze
et al. (2015), who use simulations of Hα emission to show that changes in the
optical depth of the solar atmosphere driven by upﬂows can lead to absorption of
red-wing photons at a higher altitude, producing a blue asymmetry. This eﬀect
has also been noted by Kerr et al. (2016) to occur in Mg ii lines.

In Section 3.4 we detail the locations of the observed plasma ﬂows. In par-
ticular we highlight the IRIS Si iv observations where the transient blue-shifted
ﬂows (Figure 11) are found to coincide with an extended bright feature observed
in AIA 193 ˚A data. These ﬂows are fast with blue-shifted velocities up to a max-
imum of ≈200 km s−1, and with many regions exhibiting 100 km s−1 or upwards.
These blue shifts and the related extended bright feature are very intriguing.
The brightening and subsequent plasma velocities seen in both corona and tran-
sition region suggest that we are observing energy input into the region, possibly
through reconnection. Testa et al. (2014) undertook a study of small brightenings
at the foot-points of active region loops using IRIS data to investigate non-
thermal particle heating produced by nano-ﬂares. In these bright points, they

Pre-ﬂare Observations and Modelling

identiﬁed blue-shifted plasma with typical centroid velocities of ≈15 km s−1, and
velocities of up to 40 km s−1 in the wings. These velocities are far slower than
those that we have identiﬁed, leading us to conclude that nano-ﬂare activity is
likely not the driver of these ﬂows and that we are not observing standard active
region dynamics.

The non-potential magnetic ﬁeld modelling described in Section 3.5 shows
that a magnetic ﬂux rope is present in the location of the ﬁlament over an hour
prior to the X-class ﬂare. The presence of a magnetic ﬂux rope is also supported
by Yang, Guo, and Ding (2016), whose modelling identiﬁed a ﬂux rope in the
active region from 09:00 UT. The inferred presence of a ﬂux rope within the
active region before the ﬂare allows us to conﬁne our ideas of what could be
driving the observed ﬂows. Strongly blue-shifted ﬂows of up to 200 km s−1 in the
transition region have been observed in pre-ﬂare IRIS data by Cheng, Ding, and
Fang (2015). In this paper the authors presened observations of two active regions
prior to ﬂare events. Within these areas studied, blue shifts of 200 km s−1 were
identiﬁed to occur in the presence of ﬁlaments. The authors interpreted these
fast up-ﬂows to be the result of magnetic reconnection occurring between two
smaller ﬂux ropes, to create a larger ﬂux rope. The authors also identiﬁed down-
ﬂows at the foot points of the ﬁnal ﬂux rope. These strong ﬂows were observed
in Ca ii, Mg ii and Si iv. Cheng, Ding, and Fang (2015) did not investigate the
coronal response to this activity, but comparing this work to our own obser-
vations, we note that the presence of strong ﬂows located in the centre of the
ﬁlament/ﬂux rope, and observed from the chromosphere through to the corona,
compares well. We do not observe the foot-points of the ﬁlament/ﬂux rope with
the spectrometers and so cannot comment on whether this piece of the Cheng,
Ding, and Fang (2015) interpretation is present in our results. The presence of
the ﬂux rope in the region of study is another piece of evidence in favour of using
the Cheng, Ding, and Fang (2015) model to interpret this pre-ﬂare behaviour.

Kink instability is another possible mechanism through which solar ﬂares can
be triggered. If the kink instability were to be the driver for the ﬂare we observe
we would expect to identify both red and blue-shifted plasma along the ﬂux rope
(e.g., Williams et al., 2009). From our spectroscopic observations we identify only
blue shifts along the length of the ﬁlament. This casts signiﬁcant doubt on the
kink instability being responsible for the activity. The weakly twisted nature of
the magnetic ﬂux rope identiﬁed through our modelling also serves to further
rule out the kink instability as the driver. We determine that the level of twist in
the ﬂux rope is insuﬃcient to become kink unstable. We therefore conclude that
thekink instability is not the driver of the observed activity due to the ﬁndings
of our spectral observations and modelling.

Tether-cutting reconnection and magnetic breakout may also be considered as
possible explanations for the strong ﬂows and extended pre-ﬂare brightenings ob-
served. Activity associated with the breakout model would be expected to occur
away from the ﬁlament. As the observed activity is seen to lie along the ﬁlament
we conclude that it is unlikely that reconnection due to magnetic breakout is
the driver of this activity within the spectrometer ﬁelds of view. Tether-cutting
reconnection proves to be a better candidate to explain this activity as related
brightenings have been observed close to ﬁlaments (Warren and Warshall, 2001).

AIA 193 ˚A data. Panel (b) shows the blue shifts superimposed onto SJI data during ﬂaring.
This image is chosen as it is the closest image to the ﬂare peak that is not saturated. Flare
ribbons are visible and appear to lie close to the brightenings seen in earlier SJI and AIA
193 ˚A data. Panel (c) shows the situation post ﬂare. We can clearly see the ﬂare ribbons have
expanded outwards from their initial positions.

Figure 15. Evolution of positive ﬂux with time over-plotted on the GOES light curve. We
can see that over the period of joint EIS/IRIS observation there is sustained ﬂux emergence
into the region of study. This emergence continues until 16:10 UT, highlighted by the dotted
line. The nadir of this drop is coincident with the C-class ﬂare at 16:24 UT. The ﬂux then stays
constant until 16:46 UT, where a second smaller drop in ﬂux is observed (dashed line). This
drop in magnetic ﬂux is broadly coincident with the onset of the ﬂows described in Section
3.2. This decrease in ﬂux recovers quickly to its previous level. Again the ﬂux remains roughly
constant until 17:30 UT where a large increase in the ﬂux is observed prior to the steep drop
coincident with the X-ﬂare at 17:35 UT.

The work of Kleint et al. (2015) showed the ﬁlament in this active region to be
slowly rising in the hours before the eventual eruption, which would also be
consistent with the tether cutting model.

As the extended bright features occur in the region of the ﬂare and ﬁlament
eruption, we investigate whether there could be a relation to the ﬂare ribbons.
In Figure 14 we show Hinode/EIS Fe xii data at −100 km s−1, observed at
17:00 UT and overlaid on to IRIS slit jaw images in the 1400 ˚A pass band at
three separate times. In panel (a) we see the extended brightenings at 17:00 UT,
that are discussed in Figure 11, linking the two regions of Hinode/EIS blueshift.
During the ﬂare at 17:44 UT (panel (b)) we can see that the appearance of
ﬂare ribbons and their locations. There appear to be ribbon brightenings in
close proximity to the locations of the Hinode/EIS blue-shifted regions. Strong
brightenings are also clearly seen to lie along the path of the ﬁlament as it
appeared prior to its eruption. The slit jaw imager data saturates as the peak of
the ﬂare is reached. Panel (c) shows the situation at 17:54 UT, after saturation
of the data has passed. Here we see that the ﬂare ribbons are more obvious and
have expanded outwards from their earlier positions. Flare ribbons are commonly
observed during a ﬂare, but have been identiﬁed prior to the impulsive phase.
Fletcher et al. (2013) identiﬁed ﬂare ribbons appearing to lie within a ﬁlament
minutes prior to ﬂaring after which they underwent outward expansion. The
locations of the extended brightenings in panel (a) and the ﬂare ribbons in
panel (b) are both very close to the location of the ﬁlament. This could suggest
that the extended brightening may have a relation to the ﬂare ribbons, however
due to their appearance ≈40 minutes before onset of ﬂaring, it is highly doubtful
that they are actually ribbons themselves.

The work of Kusano et al. (2012) and Bamba et al. (2013) proposed and
provided observational evidence for small scale ﬂux emergence at the PIL of an
active region being related to the triggering of ﬂares. For the active region studied
in this paper, Figure 15 shows the evolution of positive magnetic ﬂux compared

to GOES soft X-ray ﬂux between 14:00 UT and 19:00 UT on 29 March 2014. We
see a general trend of increasing magnetic ﬂux over time. A gradual decrease in
magnetic ﬂux is observed from 16:10 UT, marked by the dotted line in Figure
15. The nadir of this decrease is coincident with the 16:24 UT C-ﬂare. The ﬂux
level then plateaus for ≈25 minutes until another drop is observed (marked by
the dashed line in Figure 15). This second decrease coincides with the onset of
the strong ﬂows that we have observed throughout the solar atmosphere around
17:00 UT. The ﬂux level increases once more to a maximum value of 9.99 ×
1020 Mx just prior to the onset of the X-ﬂare at 17:35 UT. At this time a rapid
decrease in magnetic ﬂux is then observed in conjunction with the impulsive rise
in GOES soft X-ray ﬂux. This behaviour is consistent with the events designated
as opposite polarity (OP) in Bamba et al. (2013), where small bipole ﬂuxes that
emerge along the PIL are of opposite polarity to the active region into which
they emerge. In this scenario, magnetic ﬂux must rise to a critical level and
rapidly decrease when the ﬂare is triggered by an instability in the system. The
apparent decrease in magnetic ﬂux at the time of the strong ﬂows also indicates
that there is some process occurring in the same region that is leading to the
loss of ﬂux. This could be due to ﬂux cancellation, with reconnection driving
the observed ﬂows in the upper atmosphere and the subsequent submergence of
the resulting small post reconnection loops being the observed ﬂux cancellation.
Alternatively, the decrease in magnetic ﬂux at the time of the observed pre-ﬂare
activity could be due to plasma ﬂows in the atmosphere, or a heating process
exerting a pressure upon the magnetic ﬁeld. This could the change the inclination
of the magnetic ﬁeld resulting in the observed decrease in magnetic ﬂux due to
line-of-sight eﬀects.

5. Conclusions

In this work we carry out the ﬁrst simultaneous spectroscopic study of pre-
ﬂare activity in the solar atmosphere from the corona to the chromosphere.
Using observations from Hinode/EIS and IRIS we have identify the presence
of strongly blue-shifted plasma ﬂows with velocities of up to 200 km s−1 in
Si iv emissions from the transition region. These strongly blue-shifted ﬂows also
appear to be related to an extended bright feature observed to lie along the
ﬁlament by SDO/AIA and IRIS SJI data. In our eﬀorts to investigate these
observed features, we undertake non-potential magnetic ﬁeld modelling of the
region detailed in Section 3.5. This reveals the presence of a weakly twisted ﬂux
rope over one hour prior to the ﬂare and ﬁlament eruption. Section 4 details
how these results relate to existing ﬂare trigger models. The models which do
not ﬁt with our observations are as follows. i) Kink Instability: due to the weakly
twisted nature of the ﬂux rope and the absence of evidence of untwisting (red and
blue shifts along the ﬁlament) we determine that it is highly unlikely that the
activity is driven by the kink instability. ii) Breakout reconnection: within the
spectrometer ﬁelds of view, all brightenings and ﬂows are observed to occur close
to or within the ﬁlament. This therefore rules out the likelihood of this activity
being explained by breakout reconnection within the ﬁeld of view available.

SOLA: template.tex; 26 October 2018; 12:57; p. 24

Pre-ﬂare Observations and Modelling

However, as the ﬁeld of view of both spectrometers is small, we cannot rule out
breakout reconnection occurring remotely from the area we observe.

More probable explanations for these ﬂows and brightenings are that they
are related to the following phenomena. i) Reconnection in the ﬂux rope: the
strongly blue-shifted plasma that we are observing in the centre of the ﬂux rope
maybe driven by a process akin to that described by Cheng, Ding, and Fang
(2015). ii) Early onset of ﬂare reconnection: the positions of the plasma ﬂows
and brightenings in relation to the ﬂare ribbons are investigated. It is found that
the positions of the brightenings can be related to the ﬂare ribbons that appear
during the ﬂare. This would imply that we are observing the onset of ﬂare recon-
nection 40 minutes prior to the main ﬂare onset. iii) Tether-cutting reconnection:
the position of the strong ﬂows and brightenings along the ﬁlament suggests that
the observed activity may be the result of tether-cutting reconnection.

The pre-ﬂare environment is very complex and not all activity related to the
diﬀerent trigger mechanisms is unique. The strong ﬂows that we observe could
be indicative of several possible ﬂare drivers. We are therefore unable to provide
conclusive evidence of one mechanism that drives the onset for the ﬂare. Due to
the complex nature of the solar atmosphere at the time the activity is observed
it is perhaps likely that some combination of all the possible trigger mechanisms
drives the observed activity.
