ABSTRACT

Emerging dimming occurs in isolated solar active regions (ARs) during the early stages of magnetic ﬂux
emergence. Observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, it features a rapid decrease in extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV) emission in the 171 ˚A channel images, and a simultaneous increase in the 211 ˚A images. Here, we
analyze the coronal thermodynamic and magnetic properties to probe its physical origin. We calculate the
time-dependent differential emission measures for a sample of 18 events between 2010 and 2012. The emission
5.9 is well correlated with the EM increase in

6.4 over eight orders of magnitude. This suggests that the coronal plasma is being heated from
the quiet-Sun, sub-MK temperature to 1–2 MK, more typical for ARs. Potential ﬁeld extrapolation indicates sig-
niﬁcant change in the local magnetic connectivity: the dimming region is now linked to the newly emerged ﬂux
via longer loops. We conclude that emerging dimming is likely caused by coronal heating episodes, powered
by reconnection between the emerging and the ambient magnetic ﬁelds.

1. INTRODUCTION

Our nearest star, the Sun, serves as a unique laboratory for
stellar processes. In particular, strong magnetic ﬁelds in ac-
tive regions (ARs) interact with the coronal plasma, changing
its thermal structure as they emerge. Studying the formation,
evolution, and decay of ARs allows for a deeper understand-
ing of solar variability, and how it impacts us on Earth in the
form of space weather. The relation between the magnetic
ﬁeld and the plasma thermodynamic properties may hold the
key to solving the coronal heating problem.

One interesting feature recently discovered is the “emerg-
ing dimming” (Zhang et al. 2012) in isolated ARs. This type
of ARs emerge with no other pre-existing AR in the vicin-
ity, so the local magnetic ﬂux is likely balanced with little
open ﬂux. As initially reported, 24 isolated ARs between
2010 June to 2011 May exhibited decreases of emission in an
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channel dominated by the lower-
temperature Fe IX 171 ˚A line (0.6 MK) during the early
emerging stages. For the higher-temperature lines, in par-
ticular Fe XIV 211 ˚A (2 MK), the emission increased contin-
uously (Figure 1). No dimming was observed in other chan-

nels. The emerging dimming regions are situated next to or
around the emerging ﬂux, with a fan or halo shape, respec-
tively. Zhang et al. (2012) speculated that coronal magnetic
reconnection between the emerging and background ﬁelds
heats up the coronal plasma, thus causing the cooler chan-
nel to dim and the warmer channels to brighten.

Here we analyze the coronal thermodynamic and magnetic
properties of emerging dimming. We speciﬁcally test the
hypothesis that the observed dimming is caused by plasma
heating, rather than other mechanisms such as mass loss.
Using multi-wavelength EUV data, we calculate the time-
dependent differential emission measure (DEM) and the
emission measure (EM) in selective temperature ranges. Fur-
ther, we study the change of the magnetic ﬁeld connectivity
for a representative case using a potential ﬁeld extrapolation
model. These calculations yield insights on how the density
of the optically-thin plasma at different temperatures changes
temporally and in response to the surface magnetic ﬁeld, thus
allowing us to probe the underlying physical processes.

2. DATA & METHODS

2.1. Observation

With the advent of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO;
Pesnell et al. 2012), launched in 2010, the solar corona is

two main properties provided by the list are (1) their visibility
in the continuum, and (2) the degree of spatial isolation, i.e.,
whether the emergence occurs in relatively quiet areas of the
Sun that do not contain, and are not in the vicinity of, pre-
existing ARs. The second criterion allows us to select only
isolated ARs where emerging dimming was ﬁrst identiﬁed
(Zhang et al. 2012). It also avoids the possible inﬂuence of
AR-AR interaction so the interpretation of the results is more
straightforward.

2.2. Data Acquisition & Processing

We search for emerging dimming events over a two-year
period from 2010 to 2012 based on visual inspection. Using
the starting times of ﬂux emergence given in Schunker et al.
(2016), we check the AIA 171 ˚A images using JHelioviewer
(M¨uller et al. 2017), which provides an easy way to query and
visualize SDO data. If we observe signiﬁcant dimming next
to or around the emerging ﬂux, we manually deﬁne (1) a time
range (typically a few days) to encapsulate the full history of
the AR, including times before and during full emergence,
and (2) a ﬁxed ﬁeld of view (FOV) in the native Heliopro-
jective coordinate. We subsequently extract SDO data cubes
corresponding to this time range and FOV for each event at
30 minute cadence. The data cubes include six AIA EUV
channels (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 ˚A) and HMI LOS
magnetograms. Our ﬁnal sample consists of 18 events (Ta-
ble 1): nine were included in Zhang et al. (2012); nine are
new from 2012. We discuss the efﬁcacy of this sample in
Section 4.

We perform all data reductions using the SolarSoftWare
(SSW) IDL package. SSW query of the SDO database re-
turns level-1 AIA images, in which the raw images have been
de-spiked, had bad pixels removed, and ﬂat-ﬁelded. We use
the module aia prep.pro to process the images into level 1.5,
adjusting images to a common plate scale and ensuring all
images are centered at the same pixel. The images are also
de-rotated and co-aligned so as to enable a direct comparison
between different times.

Our analysis focuses on an “emerging dimming region” de-
ﬁned as a contiguous, enclosed area whose 171 ˚A brightness
declined post-emergence of the central AR. The contours for
each AR were selected based on the 171 ˚A image pixel values
during times when the AR’s surrounding area visibly dark-
ened. This subregion is ﬁxed for each AR through its entire
time series. This is illustrated by the red contours in Figure 1
for a sample event in AR 11570. The dimming regions were
extracted based on a contour applied to the 171 ˚A images
after the time of emergence given in Schunker et al. (2016).
The contour threshold was set to be below half of the average
surrounding medium around the AR in the 171 ˚A data to form
a contiguous entity surrounding the AR. The same contour
was then applied to the 211 ˚A images and magnetograms.

which is used as a representative example throughout the paper. Left

continuously monitored over 10 UV/EUV wavelengths with
a cadence of 12 s and spatial sampling of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 with the Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012). In ad-
dition, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou
et al. 2012), also on board SDO, measures both line-of-sight
(LOS) and vector magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere. The
LOS and vector magnetograms are taken at a cadence of 45 s
and 12 minute respectively, with a spatial sampling of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5.

With high cadence and a continuous, voluminous dataset,
SDO is a rich resource for studying how emerging dimming
forms, and how they change through time. By observing the
Sun in different, optically-thin EUV channels with AIA, in-
formation about the coronal electron density and temperature
is recorded through time. Contemporaneous EUV and mag-
netic ﬁeld observations allows for direct association between
the coronal dynamics and their photospheric sources.

We used the list of emerging ARs reported in Schunker
et al. (2016) to search for cases of emerging dimming. The

during emerging dimming (dark blue, dashed line) for AR11570.
This DEM solution is obtained from one pixel within the map shown
in Figure 1. Error bars are caused by random noise, determined by
the method of Monte-Carlo resampling. The two transparent orange
regions denote the temperature bins used for the EM calculations,
where the low temperature bin ranges from log10 T = 5.7 − 5.9
and the high temperature bin ranges from log10 T = 6.2 − 6.4.

We consider the start of the dimming time, t0, around the
time of emergence given in Schunker et al. (2016). The time
of maximum dimming, t∗, was then determined as the min-
imum of the spatially integrated EMlow curve, described in
the following section.

we analyze the coronal DEM:

Here, DEM is a function of the temperature T ; ne(T, z) is

to solve for DEM from Equation 3 so as to learn about the

thermodynamic parameters ne and T . This process is called
DEM inversion.

We employ the DEM algorithm described in Cheung et al.
(2015), which computes DEM solutions using a linear pro-
gramming (also called linear optimization) approach based
on the concept of sparsity. This differs from other com-
monly used procedures, which are mostly based on χ2-
minimization. The sparsity constraint reduces the risk of
overﬁtting for underdetermined systems.

After creating data cubes for each emerging dimming
event in the six AIA channels, we use the SSW module
aia sparse em solve.pro to calculate the DEM solutions
over time. In the end, for each event we have a cube of a
DEM solution for each AIA pixel, aligned over time to cover
the whole duration. The calculations are typically performed
in the logarithm temperature space with a ∆ log10 T = 0.1
bin size.

Our analysis is mostly focused on the total EM integrated
over the emerging dimming region, denoted as (cid:80) EM. We
integrate for following two temperature ranges: (cid:80) EMlow

a method to estimate the random error associated with the

We utilize the SSWIDL module aia bp estimate error.pro

Notes. The ﬁrst nine events were included in the original sample in Zhang et al. (2012); the last nine are new cases. t∗ and t0 indicate the
time of maximum dimming and the beginning of ﬂux emergence, respectively. I(t∗)/IQS is the average brightness within the dimming contour
at t∗ divided by the average brightness of the nearby quiet Sun (QS). (cid:80) EM(t∗) − (cid:80) EM(t0) is the change of the EM integrated over the
emerging dimming region; (cid:80) EM(t∗)/ (cid:80) EM(t0) shows the relative change. The “low” and “high” columns refer to EM calculated for the
temperature range 5.7 ≤ log10 T ≤ 5.9 and 6.1 ≤ log10 T ≤ 6.3, respectively. Random errors of all variables are negligible. Morphology
refers to whether the emerging dimming region sits next to the emerging magnetic ﬂux on one side (fan), or fully surround the ﬂux (halo) as
classiﬁed by Zhang et al. (2012).

for an estimate of the uncertainty σ(yi) for each nominal AIA
pixel value yi in the i-th channel. Assuming the noise is
Gaussian like, we create for each pixel a sample following the
(yi, σ2(yi)), and repeat for all pixels
normal distribution
independently. For a sample size of N , this effectively cre-
ates N realizations of the same AIA image; this is done for
each channel at each time step. After calculating N unique
DEM solutions, we estimate the error as the 68% range cen-
tered at the medium of the returned DEM and EM values. We
ﬁnd a sample size N = 100 returns sufﬁciently stable quotes
of the errors. Due to a large number of contributing pixels,
the random error in (cid:80) EM is negligible. The overall uncer-
tainty is expected to be dominated by the poorly understood
systematics, which is on the order of 20% (Judge 2010).

2.4. Potential Field Extrapolation

Zhang et al. (2012) hypothesized that coronal magnetic
reconnection occurs between the emerging and background
ﬁelds during emerging dimming events. If so, magnetic con-
nectivity should change, that is, ﬁeld lines originate from

inside emerging dimming regions should have different end
points after the AR emergence. To quantitatively assess the
changes, we use a local potential ﬁeld extrapolation algo-
rithm to model the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. The algorithm
is based on a Green’s function method (Sakurai 1989) and is
implemented by Wiegelmann (2004).

We use the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in the radial direc-
tion (Br) derived from HMI vector magnetograms (Hoek-
sema et al. 2014) as the lower boundary condition. We ig-
nore the local curvature and perform the extrapolation in a
Cartesian coordinate with a 364 km resolution. We subse-
quently trace ﬁeld lines from the emerging dimming regions
identiﬁed in co-aligned AIA images. Field lines with start-
ing points close to the side boundary are not included as to
minimize the boundary effect.

3. RESULTS

The SDO observations shown in Figure 1 reveal several
interesting features. The emerging dimming region resides
to the west of the emerging ﬂux with a fan-shaped bound-

region to the emerging ﬂux.

An example of DEM solution is shown in Figure 2. For
this pixel, the DEM has a single peak at log10 T = 6.2 prior
to the start of the dimming. At maximum dimming, however,
the DEM peak shifts to log10 T = 6.3, and the peak value
signiﬁcantly increases. The DEM values in the range 5.7

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the spatially integrated EM
in AR 11570. (cid:80) EMlow increases ﬁrst, then decreases until
the maximum dimming is reached. (cid:80) EMhigh, on the other
hand, continues to increase throughout. The ratio between
the total EM at the maximum dimming and pre-dimming
times (cid:80) EM(t∗)/ (cid:80) EM(t0) are 0.27 and 1.38 for low- and
high-temperature bins, respectively. The maximum dimming
occurs 9 hr after the initial ﬂux emergence.

In our sample, the EM variation in the low-temperature
channel exhibits signiﬁcant variations in time, whereas the

3. The change of total EM, (cid:80) EM(t∗)

(cid:80) EM(t0), is al-
ways negative (positive) for the low-T (high-T ) bin, as
expected from our case selection criteria. The relative
(cid:80) EM(t∗)/ (cid:80) EM(t0), can be over 95% in
change, 1
the low-T channel in the most extreme cases (AR 11179,
AR 11431).

4. The total EM and its change are typically 1 to 2 orders
of magnitudes greater in the high-T channel.
It may
be partially due to the larger integration range in the
real T space. A bin size of 0.2 in log10 T translates to
∆T = 0.3 and 0.9 MK for the low- and high-T chan-
nels, respectively.

5. Similar to Zhang et al. (2012), most events here display
a fan-shaped morphology. Only 1 of the 9 events has a
halo morphology.

We ﬁnd a strong correlation between the changes of total
EM in the two temperature bins, as illustrated in Figure 5.
The EM values cover a wide range of 8 orders of magnitude.

Figure 6 shows selective potential ﬁeld lines originated
within the dimming contour for AR 11570. Figure 7 shows
the histograms of Br and the ﬁeld line lengths before and
during emerging dimming. While the magnetic ﬁeld within
the contour does not appear to change much (Figure 1 and
Figure 7), the local magnetic connectivity does change sig-
niﬁcantly over the emerging dimming period. Many ﬁeld
lines that originally close locally now appear to connect to the
newly emerged ﬂux via longer, higher-arching loops. This is
consistent with the loop-like features observed in AIA 211 ˚A.

4. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION

We have analyzed a total of 18 emerging dimming events
in a quantitative manner to understand their physical origin.

the emerging dimming regions. The simultaneous decrease

We ﬁnd two lines of evidence in support of the hypothesis
that emerging dimming is caused by coronal heating. First,
the changes of (cid:80) EM in the two temperature bins are well
correlated. The fact that such correlation holds over 8 orders
of magnitude strongly suggest a common physical cause. As
the heating acts on plasma of all temperatures, a proportion-
ality between different bins are perhaps not surprising. An-
other common mechanism for EUV dimming, mass loss via
plasma ejection or expansion (e.g., Harra & Sterling 2001),
will result in a decrease of EM in all temperature bins and can
thus be ruled out. Second, the change of magnetic connectiv-
ity suggests ongoing reconnection, which provides a viable
energy source for coronal heating. Such heating episodes due
to new ﬂux emergence have been quantitatively studied be-
fore (Tarr et al. 2014). Additionally, the emerging dimming
region magnetic ﬁeld remains QS-like. We ﬁnd that the net
magnetic ﬂux is well balanced. Most loops are closed, with
very few open ﬁeld lines despite the small computation do-
main. A mass-loss scenario is thus unlikely.

Our sample size is relatively small, and the selection crite-
ria are somewhat arbitrary (for example, no event is included
between June 2011 and January 2012). Nevertheless, the fact
that all events studied evolve in a similar fashion suggests
that our conclusion is not biased by the sample selection. We
further note that the two parent samples our study is based
on, i.e., the emerging dimming sample (Zhang et al. 2012)
and the ﬂux emergence sample (Schunker et al. 2016), are
both complete.

We discuss two interesting aspects mentioned in Zhang
et al. (2012) and reproduced in this study. First, there is a
delay of hours between the start of ﬂux emergence and the
maximum dimming. Both the ﬂux emergence rate and the
AR total ﬂux were shown to negatively correlate with the
delay, and positively correlate with the emerging dimming
duration. Such is consistent with a magnetic reconnection
origin. Second, most emerging dimming events have a fan-
like morphology rather than a halo. Such is likely determined

by the property of the ambient ﬁeld. If it is mostly unipolar
(as in a coronal hole), the minority polarity of the emerging
bipole will reconnect in all directions. This naturally leads
to a dome-shaped separatrix (e.g., Tarr et al. 2014), whose
quasi-circular footprints map to the halo dimming region.

A recent study found reduced 171 ˚A emission in moat-like
regions around seven isolated, well-formed ARs (Singh et al.
2021). These extended dark moats are also visible in the
304, 131, 94, and 335 ˚A channels, and less so in the 193
and 211 ˚A channels. There are no signs of brightening. A
DEM analysis indicates a reduction of plasma in the entire
5.7
6.2 range. These observations point to a
physical origin different from the emerging dimming. Fol-
lowing Antiochos & Noci (1986), the authors propose that
the magnetic loops from the moats are pushed to low altitudes
by the strong AR ﬁelds, and are thus restricted to lower-than-
coronal temperatures.

Similar dimming is reported for Sun-as-a-star synthetic ob-
servations when a large, isolated AR is transiting the disc
(Toriumi et al. 2020). The EUV irradiance in all AIA chan-
nels are positively correlated with the sunspot magnetic ﬂux
except for 171 ˚A. The AR studied is relatively stable with no
signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence. Hence, the cause may be more in
line with that of Singh et al. (2021). If it is related to emerg-
ing dimming, it is possible that the depleted low-temperature
plasma is never replenished. For more active stars with larger
stellar spots, the effect may be more signiﬁcant.

We note that magnetic ﬂux emergence simulations can
now reproduce realistically many observed structures on
AR scales (e.g., Toriumi & Hotta 2019). When extended
to include a coronal domain (e.g., Cheung et al. 2019) or
coupled with a coronal model,
they will provide a self-
consistent “digital laboratory” for testing the relevant physics
for emerging dimming.

We conclude that emerging dimming is likely related to
coronal heating episodes powered by reconnection between
the emerging and the ambient magnetic ﬁelds. An assess-
ment of the mass and energy budget will be deferred to future
investigation.
