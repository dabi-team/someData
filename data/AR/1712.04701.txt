ABSTRACT

We study the energy release process of a set of 51 ﬂares (32 conﬁned, 19 eruptive) ranging from GOES class B3 to
X17. We use Hα ﬁltergrams from Kanzelh¨ohe Observatory together with SDO HMI and SOHO MDI magnetograms
to derive magnetic reconnection ﬂuxes and rates. The ﬂare reconnection ﬂux is strongly correlated with the peak of
the GOES 1-8 ˚A soft X-ray ﬂux (c=0.92, in log-log space), both for conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares. Conﬁned ﬂares of a
certain GOES class exhibit smaller ribbon areas but larger magnetic ﬂux densities in the ﬂare ribbons (by a factor of
2). In the largest events, up to ≈50% of the magnetic ﬂux of the active region (AR) causing the ﬂare is involved in the
ﬂare magnetic reconnection. These ﬁndings allow us to extrapolate toward the largest solar ﬂares possible. A complex
solar AR hosting a magnetic ﬂux of 2 · 1023 Mx, which is in line with the largest AR ﬂuxes directly measured, is capable
of producing an X80 ﬂare, which corresponds to a bolometric energy of about 7 · 1032 ergs. Using a magnetic ﬂux
estimate of 6 · 1023 Mx for the largest solar AR observed, we ﬁnd that ﬂares of GOES class ≈X500 could be produced
(Ebol ≈ 3 · 1033 ergs). These estimates suggest that the present day’s Sun is capable of producing ﬂares and related
space weather events that may be more than an order of magnitude stronger than have been observed to date.

1. INTRODUCTION

During solar ﬂares huge amounts of energy are released over a course of tens of minutes (Fletcher et al. 2011). The
energy is stored in stressed coronal magnetic ﬁelds and released via magnetic reconnection (Priest & Forbes 2002).
While a ﬂare can occur together with a coronal mass ejection (CME), ﬂares without CMEs or CMEs without ﬂares
are also frequently observed. Yashiro et al. (2005) studied the association rate of ﬂares and CMEs. In their study,
they found an association rate of 20% for small (C-class) ﬂares, which steeply increases with increasing ﬂare strength.
About 50% of the M-class ﬂares are associated with a CME while the percentage increases up to >90% for X-class
ﬂares. Finally, all ﬂares (cid:38)X5 are associated with CMEs.

The widely accepted model for the physical processes in eruptive two-ribbon ﬂares is the CSHKP model, based on
the works by Carmichael (1964), Sturrock (1966), Hirayama (1974) and Kopp & Pneuman (1976). A rising ﬁlament
leads to the formation of a current sheet below it, and due to some instabilities magnetic reconnection sets in. Within
this framework, and its extension to three dimensions, many of the observed ﬂare features can be successfully explained
(cf. review by Janvier et al. 2015). The ﬂare ribbon evolution gives indirect evidence of the magnetic reconnection
process and can be observed at Hα, (E)UV and hard X-ray (HXR) wavelengths (cf. reviews by Fletcher et al. 2011;
Holman 2016; Benz 2017). The ﬂare ribbons mark the chromospheric footpoints of newly reconnected magnetic ﬁeld
and are caused by energetic particles transported downwards along the ﬁeld lines, in particular by accelerated electron
beams (for reviews on the underlying reconnection process see, e.g., Priest & Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara 2011).
The reconnection process itself takes place in the corona, and is in general not accessible to direct observations.
Therefore, we have to rely on other means to get insight into the associated energy release processes. Forbes & Priest
(1984) showed that in 2D the reconnection rate in a ﬂare is directly proportional to the reconnection electric ﬁeld in
the corona, E0, and can be derived from observed quantities as

E0 = BnVR,

(1)

with Bn the component of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld normal to the surface and VR the separation velocity of the
ﬂare ribbons perpendicular to the polarity inversion line. Forbes & Lin (2000) generalized Eq. 1 to three dimensions
to overcome the limitations of a two dimensional magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration required in Eq. 1. They considered the
magnetic ﬂux, ϕ, of one polarity swept by the ﬂare ribbons:

(cid:90) (cid:90)

ϕ =

A

B · da.

(2)

By taking the time derivative of Eq. 2, one obtains an expression for the rate of change in the reconnection magnetic
ﬂux over time in the form

(cid:90)

(cid:73)

˙ϕ =

(B × VR) · dl =

E0 · dl,

(3)

C

C

with E0 as the electric ﬁeld along a separator line, B the magnetic ﬁeld vector measured in the photosphere and C the
closed curve surrounding the newly closed area A. A separator line is a ﬁeld line connecting a pair of magnetic neutral
points. Due to line tying, in Eq. 3 the term ∂B/∂t is neglected. Eq. 3 gives the voltage drop along the separator line
and corresponds to the rate of open ﬂux converted to closed ﬂux (Forbes & Lin 2000).

This method was used in several case studies to derive magnetic reconnection rates in ﬂares (e.g., Qiu & Yurchyshyn
2005; Miklenic et al. 2009; Veronig & Polanec 2015). Qiu & Yurchyshyn (2005) showed that the speed of the associated
CME correlates with the amount of ﬂux processed during magnetic reconnection. They also noted that the amount of
ﬂux in opposite polarity regions involved in the reconnection should equal each other, and that this balance is never
perfectly obtained due to measurement uncertainties. Thus they argue that a ratio of positive and negative magnetic
ﬂux in the range [0.5, 2] is a reasonable range to identify ﬂux balance. Veronig & Polanec (2015) found a correlation
between the total reconnection ﬂux and the peak soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux of c = 0.78, using data of 27 eruptive ﬂares
collected from 4 diﬀerent studies. In addition, it was found that ˙ϕ (t) resembles the ﬂare HXR time proﬁle and the
SXR time derivative, both proxies of the energy release rate in the ﬂare (Miklenic et al. 2009; Veronig & Polanec 2015).
This empirical relationship between the HXR (and microwave) ﬂux produced by ﬂare-accelerated electrons and the
time derivative of the SXR ﬂux was termed ’Neupert eﬀect’ by Hudson (1991), based on its ﬁrst recognition in the
paper by Neupert (1968). Therafter, it has been established in several observational studies (e.g. Dennis & Zarro 1993;
Veronig et al. 2002, 2005). The HXR ﬂux in solar ﬂares is due to nonthermal bremsstrahlung from electrons that

3

are accelerated during the energy release process by magnetic reconnection in the corona, and precipitate downward
along the newly reconnected (closed) ﬁeld lines. Most of the nonthermal HXR emission is produced when the electrons
reach the chromosphere, due to the steep gradient in the column density, emitting nonthermal bremsstrahlung when
scattering oﬀ the ions of the ambient plasma (Brown 1971, 1973). Thus, the HXR ﬂux is an instantaneous response
to this energy input by ﬂare-accelerated electrons, which carry a large fraction of the total energy released during
a ﬂare (e.g. Hudson 1991; Dennis et al. 2003). The increase of the soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux during a ﬂare is due to
the response of the chromosphere and corona to the heating by collisions of the high-energy ﬂare electrons with the
thermal electrons of the ambient plasma. The strong heating of the chromosphere causes the upper chromospheric
layers to convect into the corona, in a process called ’chromospheric evaporation’ (Neupert 1968; Fisher et al. 1985).
This process increases the density and the temperature in the ﬂare loops, which results in an continuous increase of
the SXR emission during the ﬂare impulsive phase. Thus, the SXR ﬂux proﬁle is an indicator of the cumulated ﬂare
energy (ignoring cooling eﬀects to ﬁrst order), whereas the HXRs are a proxy of the instantaneous ﬂare energy release
rate (Veronig et al. 2005).

Recently, several statistical studies of ﬂare reconnection ﬂuxes and their relation to the ﬂare energy in terms of the
GOES SXR peak ﬂux became available. Toriumi et al. (2017) studied all ﬂare events of GOES class ≥M5.0, which
occurred in the period May 2010 to April 2016 and within 45◦ from the center of the solar disk, in total a number
of 51 events. They found a low correlation between the GOES peak ﬂux and the total magnetic ﬂux swept by ﬂare
ribbons derived from SDO AIA 1600 ˚A data, c=0.37 in log-log space. Kazachenko et al. (2017) analyzed more than
3000 ﬂares (GOES class C1.0 and larger) that occurred between May 2010 to April 2016 and within 45◦ from disk
center, also using SDO AIA 1600 ˚A data. They found a Spearman ranking correlation coeﬃcient of 0.66 between the
peak SXR ﬂux and the magnetic ﬂux swept by the ﬂare ribbons. In both studies the largest ﬂare in the data set was
of GOES class X5.4.

In the present study we perform a similar analysis, but with the following important diﬀerences. 1) Our data set
comprises a large range from B3 to X17, i.e. covering almost four orders of magnitude in GOES class. 2) We use full-
disk Hα ﬁltergrams for the analysis of the ﬂare-associated ribbons and corresponding estimation of the reconnection
ﬂuxes. 3) We study the relationship between the reconnection ﬂux and the ﬂare GOES class separately for conﬁned
and eruptive ﬂares. 4) We discuss the implications of our ﬁndings with respect to the largest ﬂares that can be expected
from the present day’s Sun, and their relation to stellar superﬂares on solar-like stars recently discovered by the Kepler
satellite (Maehara et al. 2012).

2. DATA SET

In this study we use high cadence full disk Hα ﬁltergrams and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms to calculate
the magnetic reconnection ﬂuxes and magnetic reconnection rates of a homogeneous data set of 51 conﬁned and
eruptive ﬂares, distributed over four orders in GOES class (cf. Table 1). High-cadence Hα ﬁltergrams are provided by
Kanzelh¨ohe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO; http://kso.ac.at). We selected the events
based on the ﬂares observed by KSO1.

For our data set we aimed for a broad distribution over the ﬂare classes and to include eruptive as well as conﬁned
ﬂares of diﬀerent classes. We limited the selection to events within 45◦ of the center of the solar disk in order to
reduce uncertainties due to projection eﬀects. Between the years 2000 and 2015, KSO observed a total of 4357 ﬂares,
out of which 15 were of Hα importance class 3 or 4. All of them occurred close enough to the center of the solar
disc and therefore are selected for our study. Then we selected an appropriate number of well observed smaller ﬂares,
beginning with class 2 ﬂares. Finally we selected a number of suitable ﬂares of classes 1 and subﬂares (S), beginning
in 2014 and going backwards. While compiling the data set, we put emphasis on including also large conﬁned ﬂares
while maintaining a good distribution among all ﬂare classes. The resulting data set contains a total of 51 ﬂares
distributed over all ﬂare classes (cf. Tables 1 and 2). Note that in an accompanying paper the same data set was used
to study the ﬂare ribbon characteristics (initial ribbon distance, separation and speed) and the reconnection electric
ﬁeld (Hinterreiter et al. 2017).

The Hα ﬁltergrams for two of the ﬂares were provided by other observatories, allowing us to include also the strongest
ﬂares in solar cycle 23 that occurred close to the disk center. For the X17 ﬂare on 2003 October 28 we use data from
Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO), and for the X10 ﬂare on 2003 October 29 we use data from the Improved Solar

Observing Optical Network (ISOON). KSO observations for the X17 ﬂare on 2003 October 28 have large data gaps
during the impulsive phase and are therefore not suitable for our analysis, while the X10 ﬂare on 2003 October 29
occurred at KSO night.

For each event, our analysis is based on a time series of Hα ﬁltergrams starting 5 minutes prior to the nominal ﬂare
start time and ending 5 minutes after the nominal end time. The respective times and can be found in Table 2 and
are taken from the list of observed ﬂares from KSO. For the event on 2003 October 29 the times provided by NOAA’s
National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)2 are used.

The observations at KSO are performed with a refractor with an aperture number of d/f=100/2000. The ﬁlter is a
Lyot band-pass ﬁlter centered on the Hα spectral line with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.07 nm. An
interference ﬁlter with a FWHM of 10 nm is placed in the light path for thermal protection (P¨otzi et al. 2015). Since
the year 2000, three diﬀerent CCD cameras were used at KSO. From 2000 on regular observations were carried out
with a 1k × 1k 8-bit CCD with a spatial resolution of 2.2(cid:48)(cid:48). The cadence was 1 image per minute (Otruba 1999). The
CCD was replaced with a 10 bit CCD with the same number of pixels in mid 2005. The observing cadence stayed the
same (Otruba & P¨otzi 2003). Since the year 2008, the observations are carried out with a 2048 × 2048 pixels 12 bit
CCD with a spatial resolution of approximately 1(cid:48)(cid:48) per pixel, and an increased observing cadence of 6 seconds (P¨otzi
et al. 2015).

The USO high resolution Hα ﬁltergrams are obtained by a 15-cm aperture f/15 telescope and a 12-bit CCD. The
images have a cadence of approximately 30 seconds. Comparison and co-alignment with KSO data, which partially
covered this event, resulted in a plate scale of ∼0.6(cid:48)(cid:48). The ISOON data are obtained by a 12-bit CCD with a plate
scale of ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48) and a cadence of 1 minute (Neidig et al. 1998).

The Hα data set is complemented by either 96m full disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Michelson
Doppler Imager aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) or 720s full disk LOS magnetograms
from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) for ﬂares after 2010
May 1. The MDI magnetograms are recorded with a CCD with 1024 × 1024 pixels and have a spatial resolution
of 4(cid:48)(cid:48) (Scherrer et al. 1995). HMI provides 4096 × 4096 pixel LOS magnetograms with a spatial resolution of about
1(cid:48)(cid:48) (Schou et al. 2012). We use the 720s LOS magnetograms from HMI because of the better signal-to-noise ratio
compared to the 45s LOS magnetograms (Couvidat et al. 2016). For each event we selected the latest magnetogram
available before the start of the ﬂare as listed in Table 2.

The CME association for the ﬂares under study was determined using the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog 3.
If
there were CMEs with back-extrapolated onset times within an hour of the ﬂare start time, then these events were
considered as candidates for eruptive ﬂares. In addition, we veriﬁed the CME-association of the ﬂares under study
by visual comparison of LASCO-C2 observations to the ﬂare observations, demanding that the CME position angle
coincides with the quadrant of the ﬂare location on the solar disk. For each eruptive ﬂare we use the linear speed of
the associated CME from the catalog. The SOHO/LASCO CME catalog does not list an entry for the M1.2/1N ﬂare
on 2011 October 1. Therefore we use the speed determined with STEREO-B in Temmer et al. (2017). The GOES
class, and therefore the peak GOES 1-8 ˚A soft X-ray ﬂux (FSXR), was taken from the ﬂare reports from NGDC4. FSXR
is used as an indicator of the ﬂare energy.

This Section is divided into two parts. In Section 3.1 we describe the pre-processing to obtain a homogeneous data
set, which can be analyzed by our ﬂare detection algorithm. In Section 3.2 we explain how we derived the magnetic
reconnection quantities for the ﬂares under study, illustrated on two sample events.

3.1. Pre-processing of Hα ﬁltergrams

The use of Hα ﬁltergrams from diﬀerent telescopes and CCDs makes a normalization of the data necessary. We
apply a zero-mean and whitening transformation described in P¨otzi et al. (2015). We ﬁrst normalize the intensity of
each image using

fi,n =

fi − µ
σ

,

(4)

where fi,n is the normalized intensity and fi the original intensity of the i-th pixel of the image, µ the mean value of
the intensity of all pixels on the solar disk deﬁned as

and σ the corresponding standard deviation, deﬁned as

µ =

with N the number of pixels on the solar disk. This means, the normalized intensity is given in units of the standard
deviation of the solar disk pixels.

The area covered by the ﬂare ribbons is small compared to the area of the solar disk, and has thus no signiﬁcant
impact on the mean value µ. After normalization, a median ﬁlter is applied to eliminate large scale intensity variations
such as the center to limb variation and the eﬀect of terrestrial clouds. This results in the normalized intensity values
of the quiet sun to be close to zero. All features darker than the quiet Sun show negative values while brighter features
have positive values of the normalized intensity.

All images are rotated to solar north and diﬀerentially rotated to the time of the ﬁrst image of the Hα image sequence
used to analyze the individual ﬂare events. For each event a subregion containing the ﬂare ribbons is selected. We
co-align the Hα images with the ﬁrst image of the time series using cross correlation techniques to compute the oﬀsets,
and shift the images accordingly. The SOHO MDI and SDO HMI LOS magnetograms are co-registered to the plate
scale of the Hα images and then co-aligned with the ﬁrst Hα ﬁltergram of each event-based image sequence, using the
corresponding MDI or HMI continuum images, respectively.

3.2. Analysis of reconnection rates and ﬂuxes

In each Hα ﬁltergram of the observation series we detect those pixel, which belong to the ﬂare ribbons. We deﬁne
all pixels as ﬂare pixels whose normalized intensity is ≥5.5, i.e. the pixel intensity lies 5.5σ above the mean value of
the solar disk pixel intensities. The normalization allows us to use the same threshold for all events. The threshold
is found by visual inspection of the ﬂare pixel tracking method, based on diﬀerent thresholds, in comparison with the
ﬂare ribbon area observed in the Hα ﬁltergrams. Within a range of [4.5, 6.5] in normalized intensity, qualitatively
similar detection results are obtained. Therefore we use a value of 5.5 of the normalized intensity as threshold for ﬂare
pixel detection, and values of 4.5 and 6.5 to assign a lower and upper uncertainty bound, respectively.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the detection of ﬂare pixels during the eruptive M1.1/2N ﬂare on 2011 November 9
(event #25) and the conﬁned C8.7/2N ﬂare on 2014 May 10 (event #43), respectively. The left column shows the
newly detected ﬂare pixels between the image shown and the previous one (recorded 6 seconds earlier), while the
middle column shows the accumulated ribbon area up to the time of the image recorded. The right column shows
the accumulated ﬂare area on top of a pre-ﬂare HMI LOS magnetogram. Areas colored in red and blue correspond
to ﬂare ribbons populating regions of negative and positive polarity, respectively. With time the accumulated ribbon
area grows, with the largest growth happening during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare and slowing down in the later
phases of the ﬂare. This is displayed in Figures 3b and 4b, showing the growth rates of the ribbon area during the two
sample vents.

7

For each time step the magnetic ﬂux of the newly brightened ﬂare pixels is calculated. A pixel is considered a newly
brightened ﬂare pixel belonging to a certain magnetic polarity if a) the normalized intensity of the pixel exceeds a
threshold of 5.5, b) this intensity threshold has not been exceeded in any of the previous Hα ﬁltergrams, and c) the
absolute value of the LOS magnetic ﬂux density is above the noise level. The noise level used is 20 G in case of the
MDI magnetograms (Scherrer et al. 1995). For HMI 720s LOS magnetograms the photon noise is 3 G at the disk
center (Couvidat et al. 2016). A noise level of 10 G is used to account for the increase of noise towards the limb.

The magnetic ﬂux in the newly brightened ﬂare pixels is then used to evaluate the reconnection ﬂux. First we

calculate the diﬀerence in the reconnection ﬂux between the time step tk and tk−1 as

∆ϕ (tk) =

(cid:88)

i

ai (tk) Bn (ai)

(7)

where ai (tk) is the area of the ﬂare pixels that newly brightened between time step tk−1 and tk. Bn (ai) is the
component of the magnetic ﬁeld normal to the surface in the newly brightened area. Bn is estimated by multiplying
the LOS magnetic ﬂux density with 1/ cos(u), where u is the angular distance of the centroid of all ﬂare pixels to
the center of the solar disk. Likewise, the calculated ﬂare area is corrected for projection eﬀects by multiplying with
1/ cos(u). The calculation of ∆ϕ (tk) is done separately for the positive and negative polarity domains. From this
sequence, we obtain the cumulated reconnection ﬂux up to time tk as

ϕ (tk) =

(cid:88)

j≤k

∆ϕ (tj) .

(8)

In Eq. 8, the reconnection ﬂux ϕ (tk) is derived as the sum of all ﬂuxes in the ﬂare areas that brightened up until time
tk. The time series is smoothed with a three minute time window. The reconnection rate, i.e. the change rate of the
magnetic reconnection ﬂux at each time step, is then calculated as (cf. Veronig & Polanec 2015)

˙ϕ (tk) =

∆ϕ (tk)
(tk − tk−1)

.

(9)

Figures 3 and 4 show the time evolution of all the parameters calculated, along with the GOES 1-8 ˚A ﬂux and its
time derivative for the sample events #25 and #43, respectively. Figures 3a and 4a show the reconection ﬂux ϕ (t),
separately for positive and negative magnetic ﬂux areas (thick lines) with the shaded regions indicating the uncertainty
range obtained by the ﬂare detection thresholds of [4.5, 6.5]. The reconnection ﬂux increases with time, while showing
small diﬀerences in positive and negative ﬂux. Figures 3b and 4b show the corresponding growth rate of the ﬂare
ribbon areas. Note that the ribbon areas covering opposite-polarity regions do not necessarily grow homogeneously,
as is e.g. the case in event #25. Figures 3c and 4c show the mean magnetic ﬂux density in the newly brightened ﬂare
areas. Figures 3d and 4d show the evolution of the reconnection rate ˙ϕ (t).

We deﬁne the total ﬂare reconnection ﬂux ϕFL as the mean of the absolute values of the reconnection ﬂuxes in both

polarity regions at the end of the time series, i.e.

ϕFL =

|ϕ+| + |ϕ−|
2

,

(10)

with ϕ+ and ϕ− the cumulated magnetic ﬂux in the positive and negative polarity regions, respectively. Accordingly,
the peak reconnection rate is calculated as

˙ϕFL =

| ˙ϕ+| + | ˙ϕ−|
2

,

(11)

with ˙ϕ+ and ˙ϕ− the peaks of the reconnection rate within positive and negative magnetic polarity, respectively. The
uncertainties of these quantities due to a particular choice of threshold were estimated by performing the analysis
described above based on intensity thresholds [4.5, 6.5]. We ﬁnd, that these uncertainties are about 20–30%. The
eﬀects of these uncertainties in the alignment of the images was estimated by randomly misaligning each image by
up to 2 pixels in both, either positive or negative, x- and y-direction and running the calculations for the misaligned
images with a threshold of 5.5. We ﬁnd that the uncertainties in the reconnection ﬂux due to inaccurate alignment is
about 10%. In total we therefore estimate the maximum uncertainties in the derived reconnection ﬂuxes to be 30–40%.
In order to compare the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux to the total magnetic ﬂux contained in the source active region (AR),
we selected a sub-region containing the whole AR. This box was chosen as small as possible around the AR, to minimize

8

the contribution of magnetic ﬂux from areas outside the source AR. We used the same pre-ﬂare LOS magnetogram
that was used for the calculation of the ﬂare reconnections ﬂuxes, and calculated the ﬂux in the sub-region selected to
provide an estimate of the total magnetic ﬂux contained in the ﬂare-hosting AR. Three of our ﬂares did not originate
from ARs (events #1, #4 and #36). In these cases we used the same sub-region which was used in the analysis of
the ﬂare reconnection rates. The ﬂux within each polarity was calculated separately, and analogously to Eq. 10 we
deﬁned a total active region ﬂux ϕAR as the mean of the absolute values of the magnetic ﬂux of both polarity regions.
The errors in the calculation of the magnetic ﬂux in the AR that causes the ﬂare are estimated to be about 5%. They
mostly arises due to the selection of the box around the AR from where the ﬂux is derived, as it may either include
also parts of quiet Sun ﬂuxes around the AR or may miss some ﬂux from the periphery of the AR. In both cases,
these contributions are small as they cover only regions with small magnetic ﬂux densities, whereas most of the AR
ﬂux stems from the umbra and penumbra of the main sunspots.

The partition of the AR ﬂux involved in the ﬂare reconnection process was estimated as

r =

ϕFL
ϕAR

.

(12)

Combining the relative error bounds of 30% for ϕFL and 5% for ϕAR, we ﬁnd a maximum estimate on the relative
error on r of about 35%.

4. RESULTS

In Table 3, we list the reconnection parameters derived for all the ﬂare events under study. The reconnection ﬂuxes
ϕFL derived for our sample range over more than two orders of magnitude, with a minimum of ϕFL = 1.7 · 1020 Mx for
event #50 and a maximum of ϕFL = 2.5 · 1022 Mx for event #7, while FSXR covers a range of 4 orders of magnitude
from B3 to X17 (cf. Table 3 and Figure 6). The peak reconnection rates ˙ϕFL are also distributed over two orders of
magnitude ranging from ˙ϕFL = 5.2 · 1017 Mx s−1 in case of event #50 to ˙ϕFL = 3.4 · 1019 Mx s−1 in case of event #8.
Figure 5 shows the negative versus positive magnetic ﬂux reconnected during each of the events analyzed. In most
events, the reconnected magnetic ﬂux in the two polarities reside near the black line indicating rpn = 1, indicating
perfect ﬂux balance in the opposite polarities. The dashed lines represent the lines where rpn is either 0.5 or 2. For the
majority of events (82%), we ﬁnd ratios of rpn = |ϕ+/ϕ−| within a range of 0.5 and 2. Considering the uncertainties
in the measurements, this is a good ﬂux balance. Six events show a ratio rpn larger than 2, while three events exhibit
rpn smaller than 0.5.

Figure 6 shows the total reconnection ﬂux, ϕFL, as a function of the peak of the GOES 1-8 ˚A SXR ﬂux, FSXR,
indicating an excellent correlation with a Pearson correlation ceoﬃcient of c = 0.92, derived in log-log space. This is
true also for the subsets of conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares, with the corresponding ﬁt parameters showing no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences within their given uncertainties. For the whole set of events we ﬁnd values of a = 0.580 and d = 24.21
for the regression line log (y) = a log (x) + d (see ﬁrst column in Table 4). The coeﬃcient of determination for our
regression to the data (black line in Fig. 6) is given by c2 = 0.85. The coeﬃcient of determination provides us with
In the case of the relation ϕFL
a measure how well the regression line can account for the variation of the data.
versus FSXR, 85% of the total variation of the ﬂare reconnection ﬂuxes can be accounted for by the regression model,
conﬁrming a high applicability of the regression model.

Figure 7a shows ˙ϕFL as a function of the peak of the time derivative of the SXR ﬂux,

˙FSXR. These quantities also
show a very high correlation with c = 0.90. We ﬁnd values for the ﬁt parameters of a = 0.456 and d = 22.03 (see third
column in Table 4), with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the ﬁt parameters when considering conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares
separately. Figure 7b shows that ˙ϕFL is also strongly correlated with the SXR peak ﬂux, FSXR (c = 0.86). There is
some trend that for a given GOES ﬂare class (FSXR), conﬁned ﬂares reveal higher peak reconnection rates ˙ϕFL than
eruptive ﬂares.

Figures 8a and 8b show ϕFL as a function of the ﬂare area AFL and the mean magnetic ﬂux density ¯|B|FL in the ﬂare
ribbons, respectively. We ﬁnd very high correlation coeﬃcients for both eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares (c ≈ 0.9), but a
diﬀerence in the regression lines. For a given reconnection ﬂux ϕFL, conﬁned ﬂares involve a higher mean magnetic
ﬂux density ¯|B|FL and a smaller area as compared to eruptive ﬂares. The eﬀect is most pronounced in the magnetic
ﬁeld underlying the ﬂare ribbons, which is about a factor of 2 larger in case of conﬁned ﬂares than in eruptive events,
quite constant over the whole distribution. (Note that the ﬂare area AFL and the mean magnetic ﬂux density ¯|B|FL
in the ﬂare ribbons themselves are only very weakly correlated, c = 0.34 (−0.26 / + 0.21)).

Figures 9a and 9b show the GOES SXR peak ﬂux FSXR as a function of AFL and ¯|B|FL, respectively, which also
reveal distinct correlations, but in case of FSXR versus ¯|B|FL the correlation coeﬃcient being signiﬁcantly higher for
eruptive (c ≈ 0.9) than for conﬁned (c ≈ 0.6) ﬂares. For a certain mean magnetic ﬂux density ¯|B|FL eruptive ﬂares
yield a higher FSXR than conﬁned ﬂares. While there exists a distinct correlation between the GOES peak ﬂux and
the ﬂare area, it is worth mentioning that eruptive ﬂares of high GOES class seem to involve a similar range of areas,
and the increase of FSXR with the reconnection ﬂux is mostly due to higher magnetic ﬂux densities involved in these
cases.

In Table 4, we list the correlation coeﬃcients and the ﬁt parameters obtained from the regression (linear model
applied in log-log space) for the diﬀerent relations plotted in Figures 6–9. We applied signiﬁcance tests to all the
correlations using Steiger’s z test. All the correlations in Table 4 are signiﬁcant on the 99.99% level (p=0.0001). In
addition, we also list the 95% conﬁdence range on our correlation coeﬃcients based on Fisher’s transformation.

Figure 10 shows the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux ϕFL against the total ﬂux ϕAR of the source AR that produces the ﬂare.
The ARs in our study host magnetic ﬂuxes between 1.9 · 1021 Mx and 8.3 · 1022 Mx, whereas the ﬂare reconnection
ﬂuxes range from 1.7 · 1020 Mx to 2.5 · 1022 Mx. From the ﬁgure it is seen that small events (i.e. small ﬂare reconnection
ﬂuxes) can result from a large variety of AR ﬂuxes, whereas the largest events require ARs with a high magnetic ﬂux
content.

Figure 11 shows the ratio r of the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux and the AR ﬂux as a function of FSXR. We ﬁnd a minimum
of r ≈ 0.03, meaning that only 3% of the AR magnetic ﬂux is involved in the ﬂare. In contrast, we ﬁnd a maximum
value of r = 0.46, i.e. almost half of the AR ﬂux was involved in the eruptive 3B/X3.8 ﬂare on 2005 January 17 (event
#15). Figure 11 shows that in small events (i.e. class B and C) the AR magnetic ﬂux involved can range from a few
percent up to 30%, whereas in ﬂares ≥M1 (except for the 2N/X2.0 ﬂare on 2014 October 26) at least 10% of the AR
ﬂux was involved. For ﬂares (cid:38)X4, more than ≈30% of the AR ﬂux was involved in the ﬂare reconnection. Note that
in these largest events also the total ﬂux contained in the source AR is considerably higher than in smaller ﬂares (cf.
Fig. 10).

Figure 12 shows the dependency of the CME speed on the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux. We ﬁnd that for higher ϕFL
the speed of the associated CME tends to be higher. The CMEs in our study have speeds ranging between vCME =
398 km s−1 and vCME = 2547 km s−1. We ﬁnd a high correlation with a correlation coeﬃcient of cCME = 0.84 (−0.22/+
0.10) in linear space.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We analyzed magnetic reconnection rates and ﬂuxes of a set of 51 ﬂares, covering 19 eruptive and 32 conﬁned events.
Our main focus was to derive reconnection parameters over a large range in ﬂare energy and to the study diﬀerences in
conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares. In addition, we were interested whether the results obtained allow us to draw estimates
on the largest ﬂares that may occur on the Sun. Our study delivered the following main results:

11

1. We ﬁnd a very high correlation of the peak GOES SXR ﬂux, FSXR, with the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux, ϕFL, of
c = 0.92 (−0.05/ + 0.03) in log-log space. This value also implies that 85% of the data can be explained by the
regression model. There is no diﬀerence for conﬁned or eruptive ﬂares, both lie close to the same regression line.
While FSXR covers a range of over four orders of magnitude, we ﬁnd a range of two orders of magnitude for ϕFL.

2. We ﬁnd also a very high correlation between the peak of the GOES SXR time derivative ˙FSXR and the peak
reconnection rate ˙ϕFL with c = 0.90 (−0.10/ + 0.05). The ﬁt parameters are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between
conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares.

3. We ﬁnd that conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares signiﬁcantly diﬀer only regarding the ribbon area and the mean magnetic
ﬂux density swept by the ribbons. In the largest events, the ﬂare areas reach values up to about 1010 km2 and
the mean photospheric magnetic ﬂux density underlying the ﬂare ribbons has values from ≈100 G up to 800
G. For a given GOES class, the mean magnetic ﬂux density in the ﬂare ribbons is larger for conﬁned than for
eruptive events, on average by a factor of 2. Correspondingly, for a given reconnection ﬂux we ﬁnd smaller ﬂare
ribbon areas in conﬁned ﬂares. These ﬁndings are consistent with the tendency of conﬁned ﬂares to occur closer
to the ﬂux-weighted center of ARs (Wang & Zhang 2007; Cheng et al. 2011, Baumgartner et al., ApJ submitted),
where the mean magnetic ﬂux density swept by the ﬂare ribbons is expected to be larger.

4. We ﬁnd that the fraction of the AR magnetic ﬂux that is involved in the ﬂare reconnection process ranges
between 3% and 46%. It increases with the GOES class, amounting to at least 10% of the AR magnetic ﬂux in
ﬂares ≥ M1. For the largest ﬂares ((cid:38) X4), we ﬁnd that at least 30% of the AR ﬂux is involved.

5. For eruptive ﬂares, we ﬁnd a high correlation of c = 0.84 (−0.22/ + 0.10) between the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux ϕFL
and the speed of the associated CME, in agreement to the correlation reported by Qiu & Yurchyshyn (2005) of
c = 0.89.

In the following we place our main ﬁndings, as listed above, in the context of earlier studies within the research ﬁeld,
before we discuss their relevance in terms of the largest ﬂares that may occur on the Sun. Our study reveals a higher
correlation between FSXR and ϕFL (c = 0.92), compared to the correlation found by Veronig & Polanec (2015) with
c = 0.78. The reason for the higher correlation presented here is most likely the use of a homogeneous data set and
the application of the same method to all events in order to derive the relevant physical quantities, in contrast to that
earlier study in which the results for 27 events from 4 diﬀerent studies were combined. Recent statistical studies were
published by Toriumi et al. (2017) and Kazachenko et al. (2017). In contrast to these studies, which analyse ﬂares
>M5.0 and >C1.0, respectively, and the largest event included is of class X5.4, we use a set of ﬂare events covering
a substantially wider range of ﬂare classes, ranging from class B3.1 to X17. Another diﬀerence is that in our study
we use Hα ﬁltergrams, whereas Toriumi et al. (2017) and Kazachenko et al. (2017) use SDO AIA 1600 ˚A images
for the analysis of ﬂare ribbons. Toriumi et al. (2017) found a correlation between ϕFL and FSXR of c = 0.37, while
Kazachenko et al. (2017) found a Spearman ranking correlation coeﬃcient of 0.66. The substantially higher correlation
found in our study (c (cid:39) 0.9) is most likely due to the larger range of ﬂares included. Our data set spans four orders of
ﬂare class, whereas e.g. the study of Toriumi et al. (2017) spans just one order of magnitude. If there is some intrinsic
correlation between two data sets, which may be aﬀected by measurement uncertainties and noise, then the larger the
base range of the values included, the better this intrinsic correlation can be recovered from the data, resulting in a
higher correlation coeﬃcient.

Toriumi et al. (2017) found a linear regression between FSXR and ϕFL less steep than we ﬁnd in our study, which
we also attribute to the diﬀerent data range. Kazachenko et al. (2017) ﬁtted a power law in the form of y = d xa to
their data set, using x = ϕFL and y = FSXR, ﬁnding a = 1.53. We ﬁnd a similar power law index of a = 1.47 ± 0.09
when using the same notation (cf. Fig. 6 and Table 4.). Kazachenko et al. (2017) speculated about the existence of a
good correlation between the peak reconnection rate and the peak HXR ﬂux. In our study, using the time derivative
of the GOES SXR ﬂux as an approximation for the HXR time proﬁle, we were able to prove this strong dependency
(c (cid:39) 0.9).

Our results show a very tight correlation between the total ﬂare reconnection ﬂux and the GOES SXR peak ﬂux,
c = 0.92, over four orders of magnitude in ﬂare class and two orders in the involved ﬂare reconnection ﬂuxes, with
a typical scatter of about 0.3 orders of magnitude (cf. Fig. 6). The linear regression model (in log-log space) can
account for as much as 85% of the variation of the data. These ﬁndings allow us to quite accurately specify the

12

relation between the two quantities, which in the following can also be used to extrapolate the relation towards the
largest ﬂares that may occur on the present day’s Sun, depending on the total magnetic ﬂux contained in the source
AR. These considerations are interesting by their implications for solar activity, but in addition also very important
in terms of estimating the strongest space weather events that may aﬀect Earth. In addition, such extrapolation that
is well grounded by observed solar quantities, also allows us to place the strongest ﬂares expected from the present
day’s Sun in context to “superﬂares” on solar-like stars that have been recently discovered in Kepler data (Maehara
et al. 2012; Shibayama et al. 2013). The estimates of the energies of these stellar superﬂares are up to 1035 - 1036 erg,
making them a factor of 100 up to 10000 times larger than the biggest solar ﬂares observed so far.

In the present study, we ﬁnd that in the largest solar events observed, say GOES classes (cid:38)X4, between 30 to 50%
of the magnetic ﬂux of the source AR is involved in the ﬂare reconnection process. These numbers are in accordance
with the recent studies by Kazachenko et al. (2017) and Toriumi et al. (2017). The largest ﬂuxes measured for ARs
associated to major ﬂare activity range from several times 1022 Mx up to a few times 1023 Mx (e.g., Zhang et al. 2010;
Chen et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2017). For instance, AR 12192 (covered in our study) was the largest AR on the Sun since
24 years, with an area of 2750 µhem. It hosted a maximum photospheric vertical magnetic ﬂux of ∼ 2 · 1023 Mx on
2014 October 27 (Sun et al. 2015), and was the source of a large number of conﬁned X-class ﬂares (see, e.g., Thalmann
et al. 2015). This AR was even bigger than the famous AR 10486 that was the source of the strongest “Halloween”
events, including the X17 and X10 ﬂares of 2003 October 28 and 29 which are covered in our study. AR 10486 also
produced the strongest SXR ﬂare that was recorded in the GOES era, the X28+ event on 2003 November 4, during
which the GOES ﬂuxes were saturated for a few minutes. However, as this event occurred on the solar limb, magnetic
reconnection ﬂuxes cannot be derived for it. The X17 ﬂare of 2003 October 28 (included in our study) occurred when
AR 10486 was close to disk center. It was the 4th strongest ﬂare recorded by the GOES satellites (see e.g., Tsurutani
et al. 2005).

In principle, of course, it is the free magnetic energy stored in the corona of magnetically complex ARs and released
during a ﬂare via magnetic reconnection that is the most relevant and direct physical quantity describing the process.
However, to calculate the energy in ﬂares and CMEs from observations is a diﬃcult task, and the uncertainties are an
order of magnitude (e.g., Veronig et al. 2005; Emslie et al. 2005, 2012). Estimates of the magnetic energy of an AR
and even more speciﬁcally the free magnetic energy available to power ﬂare/CME events are not directly accessible, as
we cannot reliably measure the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, such estimates are usually based on advanced three-
dimensional coronal magnetic ﬁeld models, using the vector magnetic ﬁeld measured in the photosphere. However, the
uncertainties of these estimates are again up to an order of magnitude, depending on the input data (e.g., Thalmann
et al. 2008), model approach (e.g., De Rosa et al. 2009) and possibly other factors (e.g., DeRosa et al. 2015).

The big advantage in our study is that we relate the ﬂare energy release to the magnetic reconnection ﬂuxes derived
from direct photospheric and chromospheric observations. In addition, the errors in the derived quantities are within
≈30% (see the present study and Qiu & Yurchyshyn 2005). The distinct correlation obtained between the GOES SXR
peak ﬂux (a robust indicator of ﬂare energy) and the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux over four orders of magnitude in GOES
class, together with the ﬁnding that in the largest events up to ≈ 50% of the total AR ﬂux is involved in the ﬂare
reconnection, allows us to estimate the size of the largest ﬂares that may occur on the present-day Sun.

From the occurrence rates of stellar superﬂares observed on solar-like stars, Maehara et al. (2012) derive that on
the Sun superﬂares with energies of 1034 erg may occur once in 800 years, and ﬂares with 1035 erg once in 5000 years.
Shibata et al. (2013) estimated from order-of-magnitude considerations of solar dynamo theory, that ARs on the Sun
hosting a magnetic ﬂux of 2 · 1023 Mx can be produced within one solar cycle period, and may be able to power ﬂares
with energies up to 1034 erg. Note that the value of 2 · 1023 Mx is actually conﬁrmed from observations of the largest
and most active solar ARs (e.g., Chen et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). Shibata et al. (2013) also estimate
that a superﬂare with an energy of 1035 erg would require the hosting AR to carry a magnetic ﬂux of some 1024 Mx,
which would take about 40 years to be generated by the solar dynamo. Aulanier et al. (2013) derived the maximum
energy that could be released by a solar ﬂare using a dimensionless MHD model, and scaling it by the size of the
largest AR and the highest ﬂux densities observed in sunspots, assuming that in large ﬂares 30% of the AR ﬂux are
involved in the magnetic reconnection process. Their estimate is that a ﬂare with an energy up to 6 · 1033 erg could
be produced, which they note as to be about 10 times larger in energy than the X17 event from 28 October 2003.

In our study we found that in the largest solar ﬂares up to 50% of the AR magnetic ﬂux is involved in the ﬂare
reconnection process. In addition, we established a very tight correlation between the ﬂare reconnection ﬂux, ϕFL, and
the peak of the GOES 1–8 ˚A SXR ﬂux, FSXR, with c = 0.92 (in log-log space). For the set of events under study, we

13

ﬁnd values of a = 0.580 and d = 24.21 for the regression line, log (ϕFL) = a log (FSXR) + d (see ﬁrst column in Table
4; and Fig. 6). Now, we want to use these ﬁndings to make a maximum estimate, i.e. an estimate of the largest ﬂares
that might be produced by the present day’s Sun, based on the extreme values determined from the range of observed
data for ﬂare reconnection and AR ﬂuxes.

In Fig. 13 we re-plot this relation and the regression line for an extrapolation range up to energies corresponding to an
X1000 ﬂare. In addition, we plot the 95% conﬁdence interval and the prediction interval for individual data. Assuming
the maximum percentage of 50% of the magnetic ﬂux contained in the AR contributing to the ﬂare reconnection process,
we ﬁnd that for an AR with a total ﬂux of 2 · 1023 Mx — a value that is in accordance with the largest AR ﬂuxes
that have been measured (Zhang et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2015) — a ﬂare of GOES class X80 could be powered (with
conﬁdence bounds in the range X40 to X200). Note that in Fig. 13 we have also plotted a second x-axis, where we
converted the GOES peak ﬂux to bolometric ﬂare energy. We use the scaling results from Kretzschmar (2011), who
applied superposed epoch analysis on SOHO VIRGO sun-as-a-star measurements to derive the bolometric ﬂare energy
as function of GOES class. The relation is described by a power-law, log (Ebol) = a log (FSXR) + d with a = 0.79 ± 0.10
and d = 34.5 ± 0.5. Note that the extreme events studied in Emslie et al. (2012) also well follow that relation (cf.
Fig. 8 in Warmuth & Mann (2016)). Based on this relation, the bolometric energy of a ﬂare of GOES class X80 is
about 7 · 1032 ergs. Redoing the ﬁt in Fig. 13 of reconnection ﬂuxes as function of bolometric ﬂare energy, we ﬁnd
log (ϕFL) = a log (Ebol) + d with a = 0.73 ± 0.04 and d = −1.1 ± 0.1.

The largest AR ever observed on the Sun was in April 1947, with a size of approximately 6000 µhem (Taylor 1989).
Schrijver et al. (2012) estimated that the magnetic ﬂux of this AR might have been as large as 6 · 1023 Mx. Such an AR
could produce a ﬂare of about class X500 (with conﬁdence bounds in the range of X200 to X1000), corresponding to a
bolometric energy of about 3 · 1033 ergs. These estimates are about an order of magnitude larger than the largest ﬂares
that have been reported during the GOES era, and lie on the lower end of the energies of stellar superﬂares reported by
Maehara et al. (2012). Our data are in line with previous estimates from dynamo theory and MHD modeling (Shibata
et al. 2013; Aulanier et al. 2013), and indicate that the present day’s Sun may be capable of producing a superﬂare
and related space weather events that are at least an order of magnitude stronger than have been observed so far on
the Sun.

Figure 13. Total ﬂare reconnection ﬂux ϕFL versus GOES 1-8 ˚A SXR peak ﬂux FSXR. The second x-axis gives the corresponding
bolometric ﬂare energy using the relation derived in Kretzschmar (2011). Blue squares indicate conﬁned, red triangles eruptive
events. We plot the linear regression line derived in log-log space for all events (thick line) together with the 95% conﬁdence
intervals (thin lines). Inside the measurement range, the regression line is drawn with solid lines, in the extrapolated ranges
with dashed lines. The dotted curve outlines the prediction interval.
