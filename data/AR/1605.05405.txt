Abstract. We give a new description of the Pieri rule for k-Schur functions using the Bruhat order on the afﬁne type-
A Weyl group. In doing so, we prove a new combinatorial formula for representatives of the Schubert classes for the
cohomology of afﬁne Grassmannians. We show how new combinatorics involved in our formulas gives the Kostka-
Foulkes polynomials and discuss how this can be applied to study the transition matrices between Hall-Littlewood
and k-Schur functions.

1 Introduction
The dual k-Schur functions arose in [LM08] where it was shown that their coproduct encodes structure
sln Wess–Zumino–Witten models [TUY89, Ver88] or
constants of the Verlinde fusion algebra for the
equivalently, the 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants of genus zero (e.g. [Wit95]). It was further proven
b
in [Lam08] that these functions represent cohomology classes of the afﬁne Grassmannian. Dual k-Schur
functions are deﬁned as the weight generating functions of k-tableaux; a combinatorial object encoding
successions of saturated chains in weak order on the afﬁne Weyl group ˜Ak+1 (see § 2). Here, we ﬁnd
that there is a natural realization of weak saturated chains of length ℓ as length k − ℓ saturated chains in
the strong (Bruhat) order on ˜Ak+1. This enables us to prove that the dual k-Schur functions S(k)
can
λ
be described in terms of a new combinatorial object called afﬁne Bruhat counter-tableau, or ABC, that
encodes successions of strong chains (see Deﬁnition 16). We prove, for a ﬁxed positive integer k and
k + 1-core λ that

over the ABC’s of inner shape λ.

Our new interpretation for {S(k)

λ }λ1≤k puts these cohomology classes in the same combinatorial vein
as the homology classes. That is, representatives for the homology classes of the afﬁne Grassmannian are
given by the k-Schur functions s(k)
λ of [LM07] which were deﬁned in terms of chains in the strong order
on ˜Ak+1 by [LLMS10]. In fact, our work relies on a reformulation of the Pieri rule for s(k)
λ ; we show that
this rule for computing the k-Schur expansion of the product hrs(k)
λ can be described by certain saturated
strong chains.

A strong motivation for introducing these new combinatorial ideas is to shed light on open problems
in the theory of Macdonald polynomials. The origin of k-Schur functions was in the idea that there
exists a more reﬁned basis than Schur functions upon which Macdonald polynomials Hµ[X; q, t] expand
positively.
λ [X; t] was introduced by [LLM03] and it was
conjectured that, for µ1 ≤ k,

In particular, a family of polynomials A(k)

Hµ[X; q, t] =

X
λ

K (k)

λµ (q, t) A(k)

λ [X; t]

(2)

λµ (q, t) ∈ N[q, t]. When k ≥ |λ|, A(k)

and K (k)
λ [X; t] reduces to the Schur function sλ. In this case, the
conjecture reduces to the conjecture of [Mac88] that K (∞)
λµ (q, t) is a positive sum of monomials in q and
t. The polynomiality of K (∞)
λµ (q, t) was proven independently by [KN98, Sah96, Kno97, GT96, LV97]
and the positivity was ﬁnally settled by [Hai01]. However, for generic k, this remains an open problem
even in the Hall-Littlewood case Hµ[X; 0, t].

It is conjectured that A(k)

µ [X; 1] are the k-Schur functions s(k)

µ prompting our study of ABC combi-
natorics in the context of Hall-Littlewood polynomials. To this end, we introduce a simple spin statistic
in § 5 on ABC’s and conjecture that the K (k)
λµ (0, t) can be described as the spin generating function of
ABC’s. To provide evidence for our conjecture, we prove that the [LS78] formula for Kostka-Foulkes
polynomials in terms of charge is equivalent to

over all ABC’s of weight µ and inner shape λ.

2 k-Schur Functions
Dual k-Schur functions are deﬁned as the weight generating functions of k-tableaux. To understand the
deﬁnition of these tableaux, let us set some notation. We identify each partition λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) with its
Ferrers shape (having λi lattice squares in the ith row, from the bottom to top). A column-strict tableau is
a ﬁlling of a shape with positive integers that weakly decrease along rows and strictly increase up columns.
A p-core is a partition that does not contain any cell with hook-length p. We use Cp to denote the set of
all p-cores. The content of cell (i, j) is j − i, and its p-residue is j − i mod p. The 5 residues of the 5-core
(6,4,3,1,1,1) are

0
1
2
3 4 0
4 0 1 2
0 1 2 3 4 0 .

The ABC’s of afﬁne Grassmannians and Hall-Littlewood polynomials

The p-degree of a p-core λ, degp(λ), is the number of cells in λ whose hook-length is smaller than p. In
the example above, the core has a 5-degree of 11.

Hereafter we work with a ﬁxed integer k > 0 and all cores (resp. residues) are k + 1-cores (resp.

k + 1-residues) and degk+1 will simply be written as deg.

Deﬁnition 1 Let ν ∈ Ck+1 and let α = (α1, . . . , αr) be a composition of deg(ν). A k-tableau of shape
ν and k-weight α is a column-strict ﬁlling of ν with integers 1, 2, . . . , r such that the collection of cells
ﬁlled with letter i are labeled by exactly αi distinct k + 1-residues for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.

The 6-tableaux of weight (3, 3, 3, 1) and shape (8, 2, 2) ∈ C7 are

35 36
26 20
10 11 12 23 34 35 36 40

35 46
26 30
10 11 12 23 24 35 36 30 .

Note that when k is larger than the biggest hook-length in ν, a k-tableau T of shape ν and weight α is a
column-strict tableau of weight α since no two diagonals of T can have the same residue.
The dual k-Schur functions are the k-tableaux generating functions: for any λ ∈ Ck+1,

S(k)

λ =

X
T :k-tableau
shape(T )=λ

xk-weight(T ) .

(3)

These arose in the context of the quantum cohomology of Grassmannians in [LM08], their deﬁnition
was then generalized by [Lam06] to give a family of afﬁne Stanley symmetric functions, and it was shown
by [Lam08] that they represent Schubert cohomology classes of afﬁne Grassmannians. The term afﬁne
Schur function is also used for dual k-Schur function.

2.1 Weak k-Pieri Rule
Our new formulation for S(k)
λ
tableaux in [LM05]. This route starts with a family of symmetric functions related to S(k)
be precise, the set of {S(k)

in (1) is derived along the same lines that led to the introduction of k-
λ by duality. To

λ }λ∈Ck+1 forms a basis for

Λ/I

where I = hmλiλ1>k .

(4)

This quotient is naturally paired with the subring Λk = Z[h1, . . . , hk] of symmetric functions under the
Hall-inner product,

hhλ, mµi = δλµ .

The basis dual to the set of {S(k)
λ }λ∈Ck+1, func-
tions conjectured to be the t = 1 case of the atoms that arose in the Macdonald polynomial study of
[LLM03]. By the duality of {hλ} and {mλ}, (3) implies that the close examination of the expansion

λ }λ∈Ck+1 turns out to be the k-Schur function basis {s(k)

should reveal the k-tableaux. In fact, starting with s(k)
∅ = 1, k-tableaux are precisely the objects that
encode the combinatorial Pieri rule for k-Schur functions given in [LM07]. That is, for λ ∈ Ck+1 and
0 < ℓ ≤ k,

X
ν∈H(k)
λ,ℓ

over a speciﬁed set of cores H (k)
Weyl group ˜Ak+1. Recall that weak order on ˜Ak+1 can be realized on cores by the covering relation

λ,ℓ described by certain saturated chains in the weak order on the afﬁne

β ⋖ ν ⇐⇒ ν = β + all addable corners of one ﬁxed residue.

Deﬁnition 2 For 0 < ℓ ≤ k and k + 1-cores λ and ν, the skew shape ν/λ is a weak ℓ-strip if there is a
weak saturated chain of cores

λ = γ0 ⋖ γ1 ⋖ · · · ⋖ γℓ = ν ,
where ν/λ is a horizontal strip and the rightmost cell of γi/γi−1 is to the left of that in γi+1/γi for all
i = 1, . . . , ℓ − 1.

It should be observed that if there exists in the previous deﬁnition such a weak saturated chain then it is
unique.

Example 3 The skew shape (4, 1, 1, 1)/(3, 1, 1) of 4-cores is a weak 2-strip as there is the saturated chain

⋖

⋖

.

The terms appearing in the summand of the k-Pieri rule are simply the set of weak ℓ-strips. That is,

H (k)

λ,ℓ = {ν : ν/λ is a weak ℓ-strip}.

2.2 Strong k-Pieri Rule
Recall that the strong (Bruhat) order on afﬁne type A is realized on cores by the covering relation:

ρ ⋖B γ ⇐⇒ ρ ⊆ γ and deg(γ) = deg(ρ) + 1.

An important fact about strong covers is useful in our study. An n-ribbon R is a skew diagram λ/µ
consisting of n rookwise connected cells such that there is no 2 × 2 shape contained in R. We refer to the
southeasternmost cell of a ribbon as its head.
Lemma 4 [LLMS10] Let ρ ⋖B γ be cores. Then

1. Each connected component of ρ/γ is a ribbon.

2. The components are translates of each other and their heads have the same residue.

Deﬁnition 5 (γ, c) is a marked strong cover of a k + 1-core ρ if ρ ⋖B γ and c is the content of the head
of a ribbon in γ/ρ.

Example 6 Consider the 4-cores ρ = (4, 1, 1, 1), γ = (6, 3, 1, 1).

⋖B

.

(γ, 5) is a marked strong cover of ρ, as is (γ, 1).

Deﬁnition 7 For 0 < ℓ ≤ k and k + 1-cores λ and γ, a strong ℓ-strip from λ to γ is a saturated chain in
the strong order

λ = γ0 ⋖B γ1 ⋖B . . . ⋖B γℓ = γ

together with a content vector c = (c1, c2, · · · , cℓ) such that

1. (γi, ci) is a marked strong cover of γi−1,

2. ci−1 < ci for 2 ≤ i ≤ ℓ.

Example 8 The following sequence of marked strong covers is a strong 2-strip from (1) to (3, 1)

since the content vector c = (1, 2) is increasing.

The strong ℓ-strips help to encode the combinatorial strong Pieri rule for the dual k-Schur functions.

That is, for λ ∈ Ck+1 and 0 < ℓ ≤ k,

hℓS(k)

λ =

dγS(k)

X
γ

where dγ is the number of strong ℓ-strips from λ to γ.

3 Bottom Strong Strips
We have discovered that there is a natural association between weak strips and certain strong strips. In
this association, a saturated chain in weak order of length ℓ is identiﬁed with a saturated chain in strong
order of length k − ℓ.

Our notion comes from a close examination of the core (k + λ1, λ) constructed from any λ ∈ Ck+1.

Deﬁnition 9 For 0 < ℓ ≤ k and k + 1-cores λ and ν, the skew shape (k + λ1, λ)/ν is a bottom strong
ℓ-strip if there is a saturated chain of cores

ν = ν0 ⋖B ν1 ⋖B · · · ⋖B νk−ℓ = (k + λ1, λ) ,

where

1. (k + λ1, λ)/ν is a horizontal strip.

2. The bottom rightmost cell of νi (which is always in the ﬁrst row) is also a cell in νi/νi−1, for

1 ≤ i ≤ k − ℓ.

6

Avinash J. Dalal and Jennifer Morse

It turns out that in the previous deﬁnition if such a chain exists then it is unique.
Remark 10 Every bottom strong ℓ-strip (k + λ1, λ)/ν is a strong ℓ-strip if we take the content of νi to
be the content of its bottom rightmost cell in the corresponding saturated chain of cores

ν = ν0 ⋖B ν1 ⋖B · · · ⋖B νk−ℓ = (k + λ1, λ) .

Example 11 The skew shape (8, 3)/(4, 2) of 6-cores is a bottom strong 3-strip as there is the saturated
chain

⋖B

⋖B

.

Example 12 The skew shape (6, 3, 1, 1)/(4, 1, 1, 1) of 4-cores is a bottom strong 2-strip as there is the
saturated chain

⋖B

.

This is an example of a bottom strong 2-strip which is also a weak 2-strip (compare to Example 3). In

fact, there is a close connection between bottom ℓ-strips and weak ℓ-strips.

Theorem 13 For 0 < ℓ ≤ k and k + 1-cores λ and ν,

(k + λ1, λ)/ν is a bottom strong ℓ-strip ⇐⇒ ν/λ is a weak ℓ-strip.

One immediate application of this result is that the k-Pieri rule can instead be given in terms of bottom
strong ℓ-strips.
Corollary 14 For any 0 < ℓ ≤ k and λ ∈ Ck+1,

hℓ s(k)

λ =

X
ν∈Ck+1
(k+λ1,λ)/ν: bottom strong ℓ-strip

s(k)
ν .

Example 15 When k = 3, the set of ν such that (6, 3, 1, 1)/ν is a bottom strong 2-strip is

{(3, 3, 1, 1), (5, 2, 1), (4, 1, 1, 1)} ,

and thus

h2s(3)

(3,1,1) = s(3)

(3,3,1,1) + s(3)

(5,2,1) + s(3)

(4,1,1,1).

4 Afﬁne Bruhat Counter-Tableaux
The iteration of Corollary 14 gives rise to a new combinatorial structure whose enumeration describes the
coefﬁcients in

hλ =

X
ν

K (k)

νλ s(k)

ν

.

(6)

To describe this structure, ﬁrst let us set more notations. Recall that a counter-tableau A is a ﬁlling of a
skew shape with numbers that strictly decrease up columns and weakly decrease along the rows. Given
a counter-tableau A, let A(x) denote the subtableau made up of the rows of A weakly higher than row x
(where row 1 is this time the highest row). Let A>i denote the restriction of A to letters strictly larger
than i where empty cells in a skew are considered to contain ∞.

The ABC’s of afﬁne Grassmannians and Hall-Littlewood polynomials

7

Deﬁnition 16 For a composition α whose entries are not larger than k, a skew counter-tableau A is an
afﬁne Bruhat counter-tableau (or ABC) of k-weight α if

(k + λ(i−1)
1

, λ(i−1))/λ(i) is a bottom strong αi-strip for all 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ(α) ,

>x). The inner shape of A is λ(ℓ(α)).

where λ(x) = shape(A(x)
In the construction of a counter-tableau, we start with the empty shape λ(0), successively adding bottom
strong strips and tiling (k + λ(i−1)
Example 17 With k = 5, an ABC of 5-weight (3, 3, 1) is

, λ(i−1))/λ(i) with i-ribbons at each step.

The black letters are ribbons of size one, red letters make a ribbon of size two and blue letters make a
ribbon of size 3 (or for those with out color the ribbons are depicted with a bar).

For a composition α whose entries are not larger than k, there is a known bijection between the set of
all standard k-tableaux of k-weight α and the set of all ABC’s of k-weight α. Letting K (k)
νλ denote the
number of afﬁne Bruhat counter-tableaux of inner shape ν and k-weight λ, it is not hard to see that it is
this set of ABC’s being enumerated by the coefﬁcients in (6) and by duality we can prove that the dual
k-Schur functions are the ABC generating functions.
Theorem 18 For any λ ∈ Ck+1,

S(k)

λ =

xA

X
A

where the sum is over all afﬁne Bruhat counter-tableaux of inner shape λ, and xA = xk-weight(A).

5 Hall-Littlewood Expansions
A motivation for Theorem 13 is in its application to the study of the integral form of Macdonald poly-
nomials (e.g. [Mac95, Ber09]) and the k-Schur expansion coefﬁcients K (k)
λµ (q, t) in (2). For µ ⊢ n, it is
known that the Macdonald polynomial Hµ[X; q, t] reduces to h1n when q = t = 1. Thus,

K (k)

λµ (1, 1) = K (k)

λ1n

are the coefﬁcients in (6) when µ = (1n). We have seen that these count the number of ABC’s of shape
λ with k-weight (1n) (called standard ABC’s). Assuming the positivity of K (k)
λµ (q, t), this leads us to

8

Avinash J. Dalal and Jennifer Morse

believe there exists a pair of statistics (non-negative integers) a(A) and b(A) associated to each ABC so
that

K (k)

λµ (q, t) =

taµ(A)qbµ(A) .

X
A=standard ABC
inner shape(A)=λ

As a special case, when k = n, these statistics would give a combinatorial formula for the q, t-Kostka
polynomials arising in the Schur expansion of the Macdonald polynomials – a long-standing open problem
in the ﬁeld. Setting q = 0, the Macdonald polynomials reduce to Hall-Littlewood polynomials.
In
fact, when k = n, [LS78] give a beautiful combinatorial formula for the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials
K (n)
λµ (0, t) by deﬁning a statistic on column-strict tableaux. It is interesting to note that k-tableaux reduce
to column-strict tableaux when k = n, whereas the ABC’s are truly of a different spirit even when k = n.
We thus start by introducing a statistic on ABC’s when k = n.

Here, we will restrict our attention to standard ABC’s – those of weight (1n).

It turns out that a
standard ABC has only 1 or 2-ribbons. In fact, when k = n, there is a simple statistic that gives the
Kostka-Foulkes polynomials.

Deﬁnition 19 For each ABC A of n-weight 1n, let

spin(A) =

X
i

i χ(row i has a 2-ribbon and it is not east of a 2-ribbon in row i + 1) ,

where row 1 is the bottommost row of A, and where χ is the indicator function evaluating to zero when
the statement is false and to 1 otherwise. Recall that a ribbon is east of another ribbon if the head of the
former is to the east of the latter’s.

Example 20 Consider the ABC of 5-weight 15

A =

2 1 1 1 1
4 3 2 2 2 2

.

5 3 3 ¯3 ¯3 3
4 4 4 ¯4 ¯4
5 ¯5 ¯5 5 5

2-ribbons are colored (or for those without color, 2-ribbons are depicted with a bar). Of these 3 2-ribbons,
only the one in row 1 and row 3 contribute to the spin since the 2-ribbon in row 2 is east of that in row 3.
The spin is thus 1+3=4.

Theorem 21 For λ ⊢ n,

Kλ,1n(0, t) = K (n)

λ1n (0, t) =

X
A: ABC of n-weight 1n
inner shape(A)=λ

tspin(A) .

The spins of these ABC’s, respectively, are {3, 2, 1, 0}. We thus have that

H13[X, t] = t3 s(1,1,1) + (t2 + t) s(2,1) + s(3) .

The beauty of this formulation is that it gives a hint into ﬁnding a statistic to describe the more general
Hall-Littlewood coefﬁcients K (k)
λ,1n(t). To do this, we need only the extra concept of an offset in an ABC.
In an ABC, for i > 1, an i-ribbon R is an offset if there is a lower i-ribbon ﬁlled with the same letter
as R whose head has the same residue as the head of R. The number of offsets in the ABC is denoted
off (ABC).

Example 23 Consider the ABC of 3-weight 15.

A =

3 1 1

2 ¯2 ¯2
4 3 3
¯5 ¯5 4 4

5 ¯5 ¯5

Here we see that A has only one offset ¯5 ¯5 in the second row from the bottom. Observe that it is an
offset since there is another 2-ribbon of the same residue in the ﬁrst row with the same letter. This tells us
that off(A) = 1.

Deﬁnition 24 Let A be an ABC of k-weight 1n and deﬁne

spink(A) = off(A) +

X
i

i χ(row i has a 2-ribbon and it is not east of a 2-ribbon in row i + 1) .

When k = n, an ABC never has any offsets and thus the above deﬁnition reduces to Deﬁnition 19.

Conjecture 25 For any k + 1-core λ where deg(λ) = n,

K (k)

λ1n (0, t) =

tspink (A) .

6 Related and Future work

Central to the proof of the [LS78] formula for Hall-Littlewood polynomials is the plactic monoid, [LS81].
The plactic monoid is the quotient of the free monoid A∗ on the totally ordered set A by Knuth relations,
deﬁned on words so w ∼ w′ if and only if they are sent to the same tableau under RSK-insertion (see
[Knu70]). This establishes a bijection T 7→ [w] ∈ (A∗/ ∼) and the monoid can be viewed as the set of
tableaux on letters in A with multiplication deﬁned by insertion. The ring of symmetric functions Λ can
be identiﬁed with a subring of the monoid algebra Z[q, t][A∗/ ∼] by sending the Schur function sλ to
the sum of all tableaux with shape λ. Although the plactic monoid is noncommutative, the combinatorial
nature of computation is more evident.

A reﬁnement of the plactic monoid to a structure on k-tableaux that can be applied to combinatorial
problems involving k-Schur functions is partially given in [LLMS] by a bijection compatible with the
RSK-bijection. A deeper understanding of this highly intricate bijection is underway. Towards this effort,
Lapointe and Pinto have discovered a statistic on k-tableaux that is compatible with the bijection [LP]. We
conjecture that their statistic matches the spin of our ABC’s and are working to put ABC’s in a context
that simpliﬁes the bijection.
