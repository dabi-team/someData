ABSTRACT

Homologous coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are an interesting phenomenon, and it

is possible to investigate the formation of CMEs by comparing multi-CMEs under a

homologous physical condition. AR 11283 had been present on the solar surface for

several days when a bipole emerged on 2011 September 4.

Its positive polarity col-

lided with the pre-existing negative polarity belonging to a diﬀerent bipole, producing

recurrent solar activities along the polarity inversion line (PIL) between the colliding

polarities, namely the so-called collisional PIL (cPIL). Our results show that a large

amount of energy and helicity were built up in the form of magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs),

with recurrent release and accumulation processes. These MFRs were built up along the

cPIL. A ﬂux deﬁcit method is adopted and shows that magnetic cancellation happens

along the cPIL due to the collisional shearing scenario proposed by Chintzoglou et al.

The total amount of canceled ﬂux was ∼0.7×1021 Mx with an uncertainty of ∼13.2%

within the conﬁdence region of the 30◦ sun-center distance. The canceled ﬂux amounts

to 24% of the total unsigned ﬂux of the bipolar magnetic region. The results show that

the magnetic ﬁelds beside the cPIL are very sheared, and the average shear angle is

above 70◦ after the collision. The fast expansion of the twist kernels of the MFRs and

the continuous eruptive activities are both driven by the collisional shearing process.

These results are important for better understanding the buildup process of the MFRs

associated with homologous solar eruptions.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been recognized as primary drivers of space weather. Succes-

sive CMEs have a high probability to interact with each other. A CME preconditions the pre-existing

ambient solar wind for subsequent CMEs in interplanetary space (e.g., Liu et al. 2014c; Liu et al.

2019). Liu et al. (2019) suggest that the CMEs with the physical processes mentioned above may

produce a superstorm in a “perfect storm” scenario, which would have a severe impact on the Earth.

This hypothesis is proposed based on the contemporary observations and historical records of some

extreme events. Successive CMEs that erupt from the same source region have been called homolo-

gous CMEs (Woodgate et al. 1984; Zhang & Wang 2002), or recurrent CMEs. The research on the

mechanisms of homologous CMEs eruptions is of importance for space weather forecasting, which

can help to improve the prediction of extreme space weather events. In itself, the homologous CME

is a kind of special CME that provides an opportunity to investigate the formation of CMEs by

comparing multi-CMEs under a homologous physical condition. Therefore, it is also important for a

better understanding of the physical properties of a CME itself.

Nowadays, the occurrence of most CMEs is thought to be related to a magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR)

structure above the polarity inversion line (PIL) of a CME source region (e.g., Kuperus & Raadu

1974; van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Mackay et al. 2010; Schmieder et al. 2013). Regarding the

formation of MFR structures, one opinion thinks that photospheric motions that are generally consid-

ered to be a result of convection and diﬀerential rotation are able to generate MFRs by tether-cutting

reconnection (TCR) or magnetic cancellation (van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Moore et al. 2001).

By contrast, helical structures are thought to form below the photosphere through subsurface con-

vection, it has been proposed that they emerge from the PIL as an MFR (e.g., Okamoto et al.

Recurrent eruptions

3

2008). Manchester et al. (2004) simulate an MFR structure emerging from the convection zone into

the corona by buoyancy, generating a Lorentz force that drives shear Alfv´en waves that transport

the axial ﬂux of the MFR into its expanding portions. They suggest that homologous eruptions

would be naturally explained by the continued transport of axial ﬂux mentioned above. Recently,

Chintzoglou et al. (2019) propose that in multipolar active regions (ARs), two emerging bipoles col-

lide at a collisional PIL, resulting in shearing and a cancellation of magnetic ﬂux, which is also

accompanied by recurring eruptions.

There have already been several studies on AR 11283 (e.g., Feng et al. 2013; Jiang et al.

2014; Ruan et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2014a; Romano et al. 2015; Ruan et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015;

Jiang et al. 2016; Dissauer et al. 2016; Sarkar et al. 2019). Compared to these previous work about

this AR, we are interested in how the new magnetic free energy and helicity build up from the rem-

nant of the magnetic ﬁelds left by the previous eruption, and how the MFRs build up with the energy

and helicity injected. We show that a series of eruptive events are accompanied by the cancellation

process during ﬂux emergence. This paper investigates four successive CME eruptions as a whole,

which may provide a new perspective to explore the formation of CMEs.

2. OVERVIEW OF THE MAGNETIC ENERGY AND HELICITY OF THE RECURRENT

ERUPTIONS

AR 11283 was located around N14E10 on 2011 September 4, having been on the solar surface

for several days. We follow this AR for seven days. Four successive major eruptions happened from

September 6 (two M-class ﬂares and two X-class ﬂares, all with CME eruption; the four eruptions are

named as E1, E2, E3, and E4, hereafter). We use vector magnetic ﬁeld data (Hoeksema et al. 2014)

from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager

(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012). We adopt the Spaceweather HMI Active Region

Patches (SHARPs; Bobra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2014) data and calculate the AR magnetic

free energy by subtracting the potential ﬁeld (PF; Seehafer 1978) energy from the nonlinear force-

free ﬁeld (NLFFF; Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012) energy. The temporal resolution of

the free energy is 1 hr for 120 hr. During each eruption (except for E1, which will be discussed later,

4

since no fully formed MFR structure is involved in E1 as indicated by Jiang et al. 2016), the free

energy clearly decreases in a stepwise manner (Figure 1a; all exceed ∼1032 erg). After each eruption,

the energy is injected rapidly. During the third X1.8 ﬂare, the amount of the free energy released

reaches a maximum of ∼7×1032 erg, accounting for ∼60% of the pre-ﬂare free energy.

We adopt a ﬁnite volume method (FV) to calculate the relative magnetic helicity (Yang et al. 2013,

2018). This method entirely relies on the results of our NLFFF model and provides the helicity in a

bounded volume of the corona above the AR. The overall evolving trend is similar as for the energy.

There is also no obvious decrease of the helicity during E1. The helicity decreases rapidly during each

of the last three eruptions due to a mass of magnetic ﬂux ejected into the higher corona. It begins

to decrease prior to the major ﬂare of E3 (the decrease is associated with a C-class ﬂare eruption;

Ruan et al. 2015), undergoing a mild release, and even continues to decrease for a period after E3.

In order to estimate the helicity ﬂuxes across the photosphere, we use the Poynting-like theo-

rem derived by Berger & Field (1984) for the helicity ﬂux through a surface. We call this method

the helicity-ﬂux integration (FI), which can be compared to the FV method to check the results

(Valori et al. 2016). The vector velocity ﬁelds for the FI method are derived using the Diﬀerential

Aﬃne Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008). These velocities are

further corrected by removing the irrelevant ﬁeld-aligned plasma ﬂow as done by Liu et al. (2014b).

We estimate the uncertainty for each time frame of the magnetic helicity ﬂux by conducting a Monte

Carlo experiment as implemented by Liu & Schuck (2012). First, we randomly add noise to the

vector magnetic ﬁelds. Then, the noise is propagated to the velocity and helicity ﬂux through the

DAVE4VM method. The noise is subject to a Gaussian distribution, and the width of the Gaussian

function is 100 G, which is roughly the noise level of the HMI vector magnetic ﬁelds (Hoeksema et al.

2014). The test is repeated 100 times for each time frame. In order to show the average temporal

behavior of the magnetic helicity, the original helicity ﬂux is smoothed using a central moving average

of 2 hr time series. Therefore, we apply the same implementation to the error of the 100 experiments

by the 2 hr central moving average. We use the error propagation formula below to achieve this:

(δH)2 =

(N = 10),

Recurrent eruptions

where N = 10 represents the 2 hr average, i.e., the helicity taken at every 12 minute interval for each

hour.

Generally, in an emerging process, the helicities that accumulate across the boundary in the corona

should be equal to the increment of the volume helicity. We regard the time around 19:00 UT on

September 4 as the starting time of a rapid injection of the magnetic helicity. The volume helicity

increases from ∼–0.6×1042 Mx2 to ∼1.3×1042 Mx2 up to the beginning of E1 (Figure 1b). Thus, the

injected helicity estimated from the FV method reaches ∼1.9×1042 Mx2 during the rapidly emerging

process. By contrast, during the period mentioned above, the accumulated helicity as measured

by the FI method increases from ∼1×1042 to ∼3×1042 Mx2. Therefore, the accumulated helicity

of ∼2×1042 Mx2 during this process is comparable to the helicity measured by the FV method.

Figure 1d shows that the helicity ﬂux from shearing motions is dominant and that its increases are

connected with each eruption, which indicates that photospheric motions play an important role in

the recurrent eruption process.

3. MAGNETIC FLUX MEASUREMENTS AND COLLISIONAL SHEARING PROCESS

Figure 2a shows that AR 11283 was in a decay phase and that the pre-existing polarity pair

P1-N1 was also decaying, but near the major polarity N1 in the south (N1S), a pair of emerging

polarities P2-N2 was tracked from the beginning of 2011 September 4 to the end of September 8.

We track the proper motions of the emerging bipole via the ﬂux-weighted centroids around the

peak intensity of each polarity inside a radius of 5 Mm, which is the same as the tracking method

used in Chintzoglou et al. (2019). Referring to the animation of Figure 2a, the emerging bipole

expands along the direction of the yellow arrows shown in Figure 2a. The dynamic evolution of the

emerging bipole also can be expressed in a 3D representation by means of an image stacking method

(Chintzoglou & Zhang 2013). The 3D space-time representation of the magnetic ﬂux tube structures

in Figure 2b indicates the connectivity of the pairs of magnetic polarities.

Chintzoglou et al. (2019) proposed a “Flux Deﬁcit” method to measure the canceled magnetic ﬂux

around the PIL in the ﬂux emergence process. This method calculates the deﬁcit of the imbalanced

ﬂux of a pair of conjugated polarities to estimate the canceled ﬂux around a collisional PIL (cPIL)

6

between two unconjugated polarities. We calculate the amount of magnetic ﬂux as Φ =

BrdA,

R

where Br is the radial component of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld vector from the SHARP data

set. For the HMI vector data set, the noise level for Br is estimated to be that of |B| ∼ 100 G

(1σ level; Hoeksema et al. 2014). They indicate that calculating the ﬂux from Br can lead to a

spurious increase of the ﬂux toward the limb, especially for the locations Θ & 30◦ from the disk

center. Therefore, we try to use the Br data within the sun-center distance of 30◦ to mitigate this

eﬀect.

We follow the method of Chintzoglou et al. (2019) to extract the location of the cPIL by performing

the gradient operation on the magnetograms described in Schrijver (2007). We use a threshold of

100 G for Br in calculating the gradient for comparison with the results in Chintzoglou et al. (2019).

Furthermore, we dilate the bitmaps of positive and negative polarities and get an overlap of ≤ 5

pixels width. Next, we multiply the bitmap of the overlap by Br, and use contours to get the cPIL.

The animation of Figure 2a shows that there are some breaks of the cPILs. It indicates that the

polarities are not compact, which is due to the dynamic evolution of the emerging ﬂuxes. As a result,

the polarities around the PILs are not always associated with strong ﬁelds and high gradients. By

contrast, we contour Br where |B| ≥ 100 G and get the longest “zero” level contour, the self-PIL

(sPIL) between the conjugated polarity pair P2-N2. Due to the discrete new ﬂuxes emerging between

P2 and N2, the sPIL has a winding shape and changes its location with the emergence.

To implement the ﬂux deﬁcit method, we have to calculate each of the conjugated polarities indi-

vidually. A mask is needed ﬁrst to separate the like-signed polarities from diﬀerent bipoles. There

are some rules to deﬁne the mask (Chintzoglou 2021, private communication). (1) We must properly

isolate the individual polarities from other like-signed polarities, and (2) we must contain as much

surface area as necessary to account for the dispersion of ﬂux from the polarity concentrations to

the quiet Sun areas. We assume that the ﬂux decay rate is similar for each polarity in our study,

and therefore the rate of escape of ﬂux from each mask is assumed to be the same. (3) We allow

masks for conjugated polarities (opposite polarities can be distinguished by setting thresholds) to

overlap, but no overlap of masks for like-signed polarities from diﬀerent bipoles is allowed. (4) When

Recurrent eruptions

7

measuring the ﬂux of a conjugate bipole, i.e., P2-N2, the masks for positive and negative polarities

should have equal pixel areas, to mitigate the errors coming from summing diﬀerent amounts of quiet

sun areas around the polarities to ensure a ﬂux balance. For our case, P2 and N2 do not move too

fast, and as a result it is easy to deﬁne a large area in which the negative and positive fragments can

be counted in the P2 and N2 ﬂuxes within the selected areas, respectively (see Figure 2a and the

related animation).

According to the masks above, we give the ﬂux plots in Figure 3. It shows that P2-N2 started to

emerge around 09:00 UT September 4. In fact, the emerging bipole ﬂux is not balanced (there is an

excess negative ﬂux bias of about 6 × 1020 Mx). One part of the excess negative ﬂux comes from the

pre-existing ﬂux belonging to N1S, and the other part belongs to a bipole emerging along the north-

south direction (shown by the purple ellipse in Figure 4a). Since P2-N2 entered a fast emergence

phase and the ﬂux monotonically increased after 09:00 UT September 4, we remove the bias from

the measurements of the N2 ﬂux, for consistency we correct both N2 and P2 ﬂuxes by subtracting

their pre-existing ﬂux bias from the measurement at 09:00 UT. The correction for the bias uses the

same methodology as in Chintzoglou et al. (2019). Then, their ﬂuxes are almost balanced and keep

increasing until around 03:00 UT September 5 (see Figure 3). We call this phase the ﬁrst emergence

episode, during which a rapid emergence of new ﬂux is ongoing (see Figure 4b). In this episode, the

ﬂux of the positive polarity exceeds the negative one for awhile, which is likely due to the emergence

of the north-south direction bipole, but soon they decay or are canceled. Then, P2 and N2 return to

balance.

We try to determine the onset of collision via the cPIL’s length, as done in Chintzoglou et al.

(2019). However, we note that the conﬁguration of the cPIL is a little diﬀerent from those in

Chintzoglou et al. (2019). For their cases, the cPIL’s length grows from zero when the unconjugated

polarities begin to touch each other. But for this case, due to the pre-existing north-south direction

bipole (Figures 4a and 4b), the initial length of the cPIL is hardly determined. More speciﬁcally, it

is hard to distinguish the cPIL between P2 and N1S from the pre-existing sPIL of the north-south

direction bipole at the beginning of the second emergence episode. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that it

8

is not impossible to determine the cPIL’s length, and we can visually determine the length from

the magnetogram observations. Figure 5 shows that after the ﬁrst rapid emergence episode, P2-

N2 separate asymmetrically. From 20:00 UT September 4 to 08:00 UT September 5, N2 moves

southwestward but P2 almost stays in almost the same place (refer to the gray vertical dotted guide

lines in Figure 5a and 5b). After that, P2 starts to move eastward, and the southern part of P2 begins

to push N1S and forms a relatively continuous PIL (see Figure 5c). Therefore, we regard 08:00 UT

September 5 as the onset of the converging motion of the two colliding polarities. In order to calculate

the cPIL’s length, we try to extract the PIL close to the converging motion as possible (as shown in

the pink dashed squares in Figure 5b and 5c, in which we think the real collision process happened).

For comparison, we deﬁne the onset of collision when the cPIL’s continuous length deﬁnitely exceeds

40 Mm, which is the same as in the manipulation of Chintzoglou et al. (2019). Figure 6 shows that

the onset of collision is around 18:00 UT September 5, i.e., during the second emergence episode. The

large ﬂuctuation of the length in Figure 6 is due to the dynamic discrete emerging ﬂuxes (see Figure 4

and 5), which sometimes prevent us from determining a continuous and smooth cPIL. Therefore, we

remove the outliers and smooth the curve of length.

After the onset of collision, the ﬁrst major eruption occurrs at on 01:35 UT September 6. Meanwhile,

the ﬂux deﬁcit between N2 and P2 starts to monotonically increase (see Figure 3). The cPIL becomes

more continuous and the length of the cPIL stays above 40 Mm. Figure 4d shows that the southern

arm of P2 (blue short arrow) push N1S eastward. A negative parasitic polarity N1P emerges (as

shown by the enlarged view) and begins to move westward. The positive counterpart P1P of N1P

is dispersed around N1P and cancels with N1N , which results in the reduction of N1N (compare

the N1N in Figures 4d with 4f). However, the reduction of N1N is not completely caused by the

cancellation with P1P . The eastward-moving P2 also cancels with N1N . The cyan dashed ellipse in

Figure 4e shows that N1P gradually merges with N1S. The parasitic bipole is located around the

unconjugated polarities P2 and N1 (between N1N and N1S). It is diﬃcult to isolate P1P from P2

in a regularly shaped mask. Therefore, we group P1P with P2. We determine that P1P accounts

for only ∼1% of the ﬂux of P2. The ﬂux of P1P dynamically changes during the emergence of the

Recurrent eruptions

9

parasitic bipole, and meanwhile it continuously cancels with N1N , which keeps the contribution of

P1P to the P2 ﬂux low. The merged ﬂux inherits the movement of N1P and moves westward. The

red arrow in Figure 4f shows that the westward merged ﬂux sheared with the eastward-moving P2.

A strong shearing motion happens along the cPIL. Figure 3 shows that P2-N2 moves into the third

emergence episode around 16:00 UT September 6. We can observe that the new ﬂux emerges around

the sPIL in Figure 4e; (see the animation of Figure 2a). At the phase prior to E3, the center of the

region of interest moves out of the 30◦ sun-center distance. Figure 4g shows that N1S is approaching

the mask of N2, which is not allowed by our rule that prhibits the overlap of masks for like-signed

polarities from diﬀerent bipoles. Flux distributions become complicated in the region due to the

signiﬁcant ﬂux decay from the polarity concentrations. N2 and the westward-moving N1S become

diﬃcult to separate. Separation would introduce large uncertainties to our measurements, especially

for the location Θ & 30◦. In spite of this, Figure 4g and 4h show that the majority part of the

westward-moving polarities (shown by the red arrows) never get into the N2 mask. Although we do

not consider this part of the ﬂux deﬁcit after September 8, the deﬁcit probably continues to increase

with the ongoing ﬂux emergence.

The ﬂux measurements show that the maximum deﬁcit within a conﬁdence region of the sun-center

angle (≤ 30◦) is ∼0.7 × 1021 Mx (see the green curve in Figure 3), which is comparable to that of AR

11158 in Chintzoglou et al. (2019). The uncertainty comes from three sources, which are estimated

following the method as in Chintzoglou et al. (2019). The ﬁrst source is the choise of threshold |B|.

When a threhold |B| = 100 G (1σ noise level) is set, it reduces the maximum deﬁcit by ∼1.8% within

the 30◦; if set |B| = 200 G (2σ noise level) is used, it reduces the maximum deﬁcit by ∼51.9% within

the 30◦. This shows that the deﬁcit decreases quickly when the noise level is changed from 100 to

200 G. Our explanation for this is that the leading positive polarity P2 is more concentrated, and the

following negative polarity is more dispersed, which is visualized by the 3D space-time representation

of the magnetic ﬂux tube structures in Figure 2b. When the threshold is increased to some value

between the dispersed negative ﬂux and the stronger positive ﬂux, more dispersed negative ﬂuxes are

removed from the total N2 than from the positive ﬂuxes, which reduces the ﬂux deﬁcit largely. Thus,

10

the source of uncertainty, unoise, comes from trying to reduce the instrument noise in the SHARP

data for the ﬂux deﬁcit calculation.

A second source of uncertainty is from ﬂux imbalance (uimbalance) caused by the ﬂux imbalance of

P2 and N2 (i.e., P2 ≥ N2) before the onset of collision (N2 ≥ P2 is reasonable). The imbalance

reduces the maximum deﬁcit by ∼13.0%. The imbalance is probably caused by the new emergence

of the positive ﬂux from the north-south bipole mentioned above.

The third source of uncertainty comes from diﬃculties in grouping polarities. As we have already

determined the P2 and N2 are balanced at 09:00 UT September 4, the south-north bipole (see

Figure 4a) is considered to be part of the unconjugated polarities P2 and N1S. Even if they continued

to emerge after the initiation, we would not consider them to be a conjugated bipole. The uncertainty

from the ﬂux imbalance associated with new ﬂux emergence has been considered in the second source;

thus we will not count this in the third source. Regarding the positive parasitic polarity P1P , although

we group it with P2, it gradually cancels with N1 and does not exist after N1P merges with N1S on

September 6 (see Figure 4d and 4e). Thus, the inﬂuence of the parasitic polarities on the “grouping”

uncertainty would not be considered. By contrast, Figure 4g shows the east edge of the N2 mask

around the sPIL is very close to N1S, which is not allowed by rule (3). We determine this part of the

“grouping” uncertainty by adding or removing magnetic elements from the mask. The uncertainty

is small (only ∼1.5%) at the maximum deﬁcit within the conﬁdence region, but with the westward-

moving polarity approaching the N2 mask and gradually mixing with N2 (see Figure 4g and 4h), the

uncertainty increases rapidly, reaching ∼68.2% at 00:00 UT September 8. As the AR has already

moved out of the conﬁdence region (N2 should be located further west) and also has such a large

uncertainty, this part of the uncertainty after E3 will not be taken into consideration. Thus, the

third source of uncertainty (ugrouping) is ∼1.5% within the conﬁdence region.

When the AR gets complicated on September 8 (see Figure 4g and 4h), it has moved too far beyond

the 30◦ distance from the disk center. This is similar to the situation of AR 11158 in Chintzoglou et al.

(2019). N2 and the westward-moving N1S became hard to separate; such a procedure would lead to

4. BUILDUP OF THE MFRS

As shown in Figure 1a and 1b, E1 is not associated with an MFR eruption above the major PIL,

which is also shown by Jiang et al. (2016). The ﬁrst row in Figure 7 shows the twist map based on

our extrapolation results on a cross section (Liu et al. 2016) shown in Figure 2a. The left and right

maps (before and after E1) show that there is no obvious change in the kernel ﬁelds above the PIL.

By contrast, the other three events (the left column) are all associated with a strong twist kernel

on the cross section. We consider the kernel with strong twists as the core of the MFR structures.

It shows that the cores disappears after each of the last three eruptions (the right column) and the

twists of the MFR’s envelop ﬁelds also decrease.

We trace a rectangular region and make sure that its long side is always parallel to the PIL (see

the green rectangle in Figure 2a). The upper panel of Figure 8 presents the time evolution of the

tangential component of the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds (Bt) within the region. The increase of

Bt during each eruption is consistent with the conjecture proposed by Hudson et al. (2008), which

suggests that the magnetic loops should undergo the implosion phenomenon due to the energy release

processes. The gradual decrease of Bt after each eruption probably manifests such that the magnetic

loops are stretched upward when the coronal magnetic pressure increases with newly supplemented

energy (see Figure 1a). We also extract the component of Bt parallel to the PIL (Btpara). The black

and red curves suggest that most of the component of Bt is along the direction parallel to the PIL,

which indicates that the ﬁelds after the onset of collision (18:00 UT September 5) become more

sheared and part of nonpotentiality remains along the PIL after the eruptions. Btpara approaching to

Bt indicates the collision process of P2 and N1S. Actually, the ﬁeld lines along the PIL became very

12

sheared from 16:00 UT September 6 (i.e., the curves of Bt and Btpara become very closed), when a

spot rotation occurrs (see the later text), they remain very sheared after that.

In order to ﬁgure out how sheared the ﬁelds are, we calculate the magnetic shear angle as done by

Wang et al. (1992), Gosain & Venkatakrishnan (2010), and Petrie (2012), among other authors. The

shear angle ∆φ is between the observed and potential ﬁeld (Seehafer 1978) azimuths and is deﬁned

by

∆φ = cos−1 Bo
|Bo

t · Bp
t
t ||Bo
t |

,

(3)

where Bo

t and Bp

t are the observed and potential horizontal ﬁeld vectors. The magnetic shear is

averaged within the green rectangular region shown in the animation of Figure 2a. The green curve

in the lower panel of Figure 8 shows that the shear angle increases from the onset of collision and

stops increasing until September 8, when the average shear angle reaches ∼78◦. The fast growth

phase of the magnetic shear is prior to September 7. Figure 4d shows that P2 is moving eastward,

but the ﬁelds of P2 are not completely antiparallel to its direction of motion around the beginning of

September 6. P2 gradually intrudes into the surrounding negative ﬂuxes consisting of N1N and N1S

on September 6 (see the animation of Figure 2a). After the later time of September 6, the ﬁelds of

both P2 and N1S become almost completely antiparallel or parallel to their moving directions, and

the growth of the shear angle slows down. P2 and N1S gradually turn into a full shearing motion on

September 7.

An MFR is the key structure related to the major eruptions. Its evolution is crucially important

for understanding the mechanisms of the eruption. The top four panels in Figure 9 show the decay

index equal to 1.5 with a height contour overlaid on photospheric magnetograms for the four major

eruptions. The decay index, n = −∂lnBh/∂lnz, characterizes the rate of decrease of the horizontal

component of the potential ﬁeld Bh with height z. For bipolar conﬁgurations and for n≥1.5, an

MFR is torus-unstable and thus cannot be constrained by the overlying ﬁeld. The areas within the

color contours are called “super-critical” decay indices by Chintzoglou et al. (2015). The continuous

stacking of the “super-critical” decay index areas gives birth to a “super-critical” decay index “tun-

nel,” which is favorable for the escape of a CME. The background magnetic structures are changing

Recurrent eruptions

with the photospheric motions, resulting in the change of the strapping force above the MFR. On

September 6, the tunnel is located along the PIL of P2-N1N , and gradually it moves to the PIL of

P2-N1S. The bottom panel in Figure 9 also presents the time evolution of the critical height for torus

instability with an average decay index equal to 1.5, which is calculated within the yellow rectangu-

lar region shown in Figure 2a. The critical height changes between 13 and 25 Mm and reaches its

minimum around E3. The value of the critical height is relatively low compared with those of other

eruptive events (e.g., Sun et al. 2015).

Figure 10a shows the time evolution of the height of each MFR. Here, we assume that the axis of

an MFR is located at the twist-weighted centroid of a strong twist kernel (twist number > 1; see

Figure 7) on the twist map, and we regard the height of the twist-weighted centroid as the height

of each MFR (e.g., Jiang et al. 2014; He et al. 2020). The height presents an increasing trend before

each of the last three eruptions (see the red dots in Figure 10a).

Interestingly, the rise of each MFR exhibits a simultaneous change with the photospheric motions.

When the polarities P2 and N1S collide with each other, caused by the separation of P2-N2, the

sunspot rotation of P2 starts around 14:00 UT September 6 (Figure 10b). We present an r − θ

stackplot in Figure 10c. The stackplot is produced by stacking an arc slit of 150◦ with a radius of

∼3′′.5. The stackplot presents the variation of the rotation speed by tracking the magnetic arm in

the north of P2. The angle θ increases in the clockwise direction from −50◦ to 100◦ with θ = 0◦ along

the upward direction (the north). Ruan et al. (2014) has gotten similar results on this spot rotation

using continuum images. The highest value of the magnetic arm (red line) describes an acceleration

phase from 14:00 UT to 18:00 UT September 6, which just corresponds to the rise of the MFR (see

Figure 10a). After 19:00 UT, the rotation speed shows a further acceleration that corresponds to

a faster rise of the MFR. There are obvious changes in both the magnetic energy and helicity after

15:00 UT, as well as in the ﬂux deﬁcit by the cancellation (see Figure 3). The shear term in Figure 1d

also shows a simultaneous rapid increase with the acceleration of the sunspot rotation.

The height of the MFR on September 7 presents a relatively uniform growth. Figure 10d shows

the shearing motions between P2 and N1S. The length of the separation in Figure 10e (thick blue

14

line) shows that the shearing motions in the east-west direction continue from E2 to E3. P2 and

N1S start to converge to each other around 12:00 UT (red line) and then stop until the later stage of

the eruption. The ﬂux deﬁcit P2 and N1 have an obvious additional increase during this period. It

implies that the converging motion enhances the collisional shearing process. We notice that the shear

term of the helicity ﬂux in Figure 1d shows a rapid change from 08:00 to 12:00 UT. Correspondingly,

Figure 10a shows that a strong twist kernel appears during this period, which enables us to trace the

height of the MFR. Then, the MFR enters a fast growth period during the converging time (red line).

Around 20:00 UT, the height of the MFR descends. This is probably because that part of the rope

has already erupted into the higher corona, which may be associated with the extreme ultraviolet

(EUV) observations of Ruan et al. (2015). The helicity determined by the FV method supports our

idea; it obviously decreases after 18:00 UT. However, the energy seems inconsistent with the helicity.

Figure 3 shows that the ﬂuxes of P2 and N2 both emerge from 14:00 UT on September 7, which

probably compensates for the released energy. After E3, P2-N1S enters a faster shearing phase (green

line). Correspondingly, the MFR evolves faster than the previous two. Compared with the previous

two eruptions, we can trace the strong twist kernel in an earlier time just after E3. The ﬂux deﬁcit

also has a fast growth during this period. However, due to the diﬃculties in grouping polarities, the

uncertainty increases greatly to ∼69.6% at the beginning of September 8, during which time the AR

has just moved out of the conﬁdence region of the 30◦ sun-center distance. Therefore, the reliability

of the results is reduced. Nevertheless, the consistent behaviors described above indicate that there

is a strong correlation between the photospheric motions and the growth of the MFR.

5. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

The homologous events in AR 11283 present an integrated physical process showing how a new ﬂux

system emerges into a mature AR and interacts with the pre-existing ambient ﬁelds, causing a series

of successive eruptions. The so-called “collisional shearing” process proposed by Chintzoglou et al.

(2019) happens between the emerging ﬂux and the pre-existing ambient ﬁelds. It is more diﬃcult to

determine the accurate onset time of collision than for the cases in Chintzoglou et al. (2019). Due to

the pre-existing bipole along the north-south direction (see Section 3), it is hard to distinguish the

Recurrent eruptions

15

cPIL between the unconjugated polarities P2 and N1S from the pre-existing sPIL of the north-south

direction bipole. We try to follow the method of Chintzoglou et al. (2019) to determine the onset of

collision via the cPIL’s length, but due to the reason mentioned above, the ﬁrst thing we need to do

is to determine the cPIL’s length as accurately as possible. It is found that the second emergence

episode is very important for the collision. We can visually distinguish the cPIL from the pre-existing

sPIL via the magnetogram observations, and then use the same criterion as in Chintzoglou et al.

(2019) to determine the onset time of the collision. P2 starts to move eastward around 08:00 UT on

September 5 and begins to push N1S eastward. The strong ﬂux emergence phase of P2-N2 appears

from 16:00 UT September 5 to the onset of September 6, during which time the continuous cPIL

reaches a continuous length of ≥ 40 Mm around 18:00 UT September 5 (see Figure 5b), and P2

deforms N1S such that it becomes an elongated shape along the cPIL. The results conﬁrm that the

onset of collision is during the second emergence episode.

At the later phase of the second emergence episode, E1 occurrs at 01:35 UT September 6.

Jiang et al. (2016) indicate that this eruption was triggered by the reconnection between the newly

emerging magnetic arcades and the pre-existing ambient ﬁelds. The fast ﬂux emergence in their study

just corresponds to the second emergence episode. Their numerical model did not produce a fully

formed magnetic ﬂux rope, which is consistent with our ﬂux deﬁcit measurement, namely that the

collision just began and less nonpotentiality was accumulated along the cPIL. Figure 3 shows that

the ﬂux deﬁcit begins to increase after the ﬁrst eruption and grows quickly after 15:00 UT September

6 when the spot rotation of P2 starts (see Figure 10c) and both the free energy and volume helicity

increase (see Figure 1a and 1b). Figure 11a shows that two bundles of the coronal bright structure

observed at the EUV 94 ˚A wavelength at 09:00 UT September 6. During the spot rotation, it seems

that the two bundles of bright structures reconnect with each other, and EUV brightenings can be

seen in Figure 11b. Photospheric Doppler velocity ﬁeld data are also adopted to help investigate

magnetic cancellation at a cPIL. The corrected velocity ﬁeld data are available in the data series

cgem.doppcal 720s, which are corrected for the diﬀerential rotation and the Solar Dynamics Obser-

vatory spacecraft velocity (see Section 4 of Fisher et al. 2020). The convective blueshift is further

16

subtracted from the corrected data, which is saved in the DOPPBIAS keyword of the header ﬁle

(for a detailed discussion, see Welsch et al. 2013). Figure 11c shows that the photospheric Doppler

velocity ﬁeld appears in a large patch between P2 and N1S. The increased ﬂux deﬁcit is accompanied

by a dominance of average redshifts at the cPIL. The twist maps of Figure 11d show that two bundles

of twisted ﬁelds gradually coalesce. A TCR process, and/or the reconnection of an MFR structure

with ambient ﬁelds or with other weakly twisted MFR structures may happen along the cPIL (due

to collisional shearing). They may coalesce into larger and more monolithic structures, as shown by

the observations at 94 ˚A wavelength (see the animation of Figure 11b). The dominant redshift signal

at the cPIL is interpreted as being consistent with the submergence of the post-reconnected loops

(i.e., ﬂux cancellation). The two bundles of twisted ﬁelds should be the MFRs. The formation of

the MFRs is also associated with the collisional shearing process. Magnetic ﬂux cancellation occurrs

along the cPIL. It canceled the ﬂux of ∼0.7 × 1021 Mx with an uncertainty of ∼13.2% from the

beginning of September 6 to the third eruption within the 30◦ sun-center distance. The canceled ﬂux

is represented by the ﬂux deﬁcit in Figure 3. The deﬁcit amounts to 24% of the total unsigned ﬂux

of the bipolar magnetic region before the third major eruption.

It is worth mentioning that the negative parasitic polarity emerged between N1N and N1S. Its

positive counterpart seems continuously to cancel with N1N . It merges with N1S moving westward

at the later phase of September 6. The westward-moving negative polarity N1S is compressed to an

elongated shape by the eastward-moving P2, moving the cPIL into an east-west direction. Figure 8

shows that the average shear angle almost reaches its maximum value on September 7, which implies

that the shearing motion becomes strong. Figure 10e shows that P2 and N1S separate from each

other in the constant speed (blue line), while a converging motion (red line) is ongoing at the later

time of September 7. The convergence of the opposite-signed magnetic polarities causes a further

cancellation along the cPIL, the amount of which can be estimated through the increase of the ﬂux

deﬁcit in Figure 3. Figure 12a shows that the increase in the ﬂux deﬁcit is also accompanied by the

dominance of redshift signals over blueshift signals along the cPIL.

Recurrent eruptions

17

As N1S and N2 approach to each other when the AR is beyond the angular distance of 30◦, it

becomes diﬃcult to group them on September 8, and the “grouping” uncertainty of the ﬂux deﬁcit

becomes large. Thus, we do not perform a quantitative estimation of the canceled ﬂux outside of the

conﬁdence region. The separation speed between P2 and N1S is enhanced on September 8 (the green

line in Figure 10e). Meanwhile, Figure 3 shows that the ﬂux emergence gets stronger during this

period. The compact cPIL becomes fragmented. The blueshift signal seems to increase in this period.

It should be related to the Evershed ﬂow in the weak penumbra (see Figure 12b); the northeastern

part of N1S along the cPIL became discrete. Nevertheless, the redshift related to the submergence

of the magnetic ﬁeld was still dominates, which implies that the ﬂux is canceling at the cPIL.

We analyze the four major eruptions and the evolution of the related magnetic ﬁelds in the AR

11283. We obtain the relatively accurate amount of the canceled ﬂux with an uncertainty of ∼13.2%

for the 1σ noise level by using the conjugate ﬂux deﬁcit method of Chintzoglou et al. (2019) in a ﬂux

emerging region, which further supports the view that successive solar eruptions in multipolar ARs

likely occur in a “collisional shearing” scenario. The growth of the canceled ﬂux has a good correlation

with the energy accumulation before each of the eruptions. Nonpotentiality is repeatedly established

through the converging and shearing motions of unconjugated polarities driven by continuous ﬂux

emergence. For most of the eruptions, the existence of MFR structures is revealed by the EUV

observations and by the NLFFF model. The MFRs are the products of the reconnection between

the colliding magnetic ﬁelds. The question of whether the collisional shearing scenario is a necessary

condition for the generation of homologous eruptions remains and needs further study in future work.

Figure 9. Two-dimensional distributions and the time evolution of the decay index above the emerging

region. Upper four panels: decay index with height contour plot overlaid on photospheric magnetograms

just before each of the eruptions. Color contours correspond to a decay index n = 1.5 at each height (in

Mm). The color of the contour lightens as it increases in height. Bottom panel: time evolution of the critical

height with average decay index (within the yellow rectangle in Figure 2a) equal to 1.5.

Figure 10. Relationship between the height evolution of the MFRs and the photospheric motions. (a)

Height evolution of each MFR with uncertainties. (b) HMI magnetogram during the sunspot rotation. An

arc slit is centered at the black cross. (c) Stackplot of the slit in (a). The red curve traces the maximum

of each slit. The blue vertical line marks the eruption on September 6 (E2). (d) Shearing motions (E-W)

and converging motions (S-N) between P2 and N1S shown in the HMI continuum image, and (e) the related

time-distance plot in the two directions. The colored straight lines are the linear ﬁts to the distances (black

dotted lines). The vertical lines mark E2, E3, and E4.
