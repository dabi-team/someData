ABSTRACT

The nearby, luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 7469 hosts a Seyfert nucleus with a circumnuclear
star-forming ring and is thus the ideal local laboratory for investigating the starburst–AGN connection
in detail. We present integral-ﬁeld observations of the central 1.3 kpc region in NGC 7469 obtained
with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument. Molecular and ionized gas distributions and kinematics at
a resolution of ∼100 pc over the 4.9 − 7.6µm region are examined to study gas dynamics inﬂuenced
by the central AGN. The low-ionization [Fe II] λ5.34µm and [Ar II] λ6.99µm lines are bright on
the nucleus and in the starburst ring, as opposed to H2 S(5) λ6.91µm which is strongly peaked at the
center and surrounding ISM. The high-ionization [Mg V] line is resolved and shows a broad, blueshifted
component associated with the outﬂow. It has a nearly face-on geometry that is strongly peaked on
the nucleus, where it reaches a maximum velocity of −650 km s−1, and extends about 400 pc to
the East. Regions of enhanced velocity dispersion in H2 and [Fe II] ∼180 pc from the AGN that
also show high L(H2)/L(PAH) and L([Fe II])/L(Pfα) ratios to the W and N of the nucleus pinpoint
regions where the ionized outﬂow is depositing energy, via shocks, into the dense interstellar medium
between the nucleus and the starburst ring. These resolved mid-infrared observations of the nuclear
gas dynamics demonstrate the power of JWST and its high-sensitivity integral-ﬁeld spectroscopic
capability to resolve feedback processes around supermassive black holes in the dusty cores of nearby
LIRGs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to play a
prominent role in inﬂuencing the interstellar medium
(ISM) of their host through feedback mechanisms such
as outﬂows (see reviews by Veilleux et al. 2020; Armus
et al. 2020). Distinguishing the drivers of such winds
and determining their direct impacts on surrounding
star formation has been diﬃcult due to observational
challenges such as heavy dust obscuration. Investigating
the triggering of AGN outﬂows is most ideally done close
to the launching site which is often obscured by dust in
the case of many Seyfert and luminous infrared galax-
ies (LIRGs; LIR ≥ 1011L(cid:12)), with the latter exhibiting
extinction upward of AV ∼ 40 mag or higher (Mattila
et al. 2007; V¨ais¨anen et al. 2017; U et al. 2019; Falstad
et al. 2021; P´erez-Torres et al. 2021).

2021) with a bimodal age distribution of stellar popu-
lations (D´ıaz-Santos et al. 2007). Evidence of a wide-
angle E-W biconically illuminated outﬂow in the near-
infrared coronal line [Si VI] λ1.96µm (R[SiVI] = 90 pc)
has been presented using VLT/SINFONI integral ﬁeld
spectroscopy (IFS) (FWHM = 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)14, or 46 pc; M¨uller-
S´anchez et al. 2011). The characteristic outﬂow struc-
ture with broad and blueshifted components along the
minor axis of the galactic disk was not seen in the coarser
optical GTC/MEGARA IFS observations (FWHM =
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)93, or 307 pc; Cazzoli et al. 2020). However, turbulent,
non-circular kinematics, detected in a component of the
Hα-[N II] complex within the central 610 pc, might be
associated with it. More recently, extended circumnu-
clear outﬂows were found reaching 531 pc from the AGN
in VLT/MUSE observations of [O III] λ5007˚A (FWHM
= 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)23, or 406 pc; Robleto-Or´us et al. 2021; Xu & Wang
2022). ALMA observations of CO(1−0), CO(2−1), and
[C I] in the inner ∼ 2 kpc region with angular resolu-
tions of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)35 (120 pc) show largely rotational kinemat-
ics (Izumi et al. 2020; Nguyen et al. 2021). Despite the
multiwavelength eﬀort, there is still no clear picture for
how the putative outﬂow interacts with the circumnu-
clear gas and starburst ring.

With JWST ’s 6.5-meter mirror and advanced instru-
ment suite, we can now resolve the dynamics of gas and

dust at angular resolution of ∼ 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2−0.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 in the mid-
infrared wavelengths (5−28µm). In particular, this Let-
ter investigates the detailed gas kinematics in the inner
600-pc region (the “inner ISM region” hereafter) of NGC
7469. We ﬁrst describe the observations and data pro-
cessing in Section 2. Section 3 highlights the moment
maps of several key ionized and molecular gas emission
lines and demonstrates the richness of features in the
mid-infrared spectra extracted from the inner ISM re-
gion. In Section 4, we discuss the properties of the de-
tected outﬂow and the shock excitation in the ISM. In
several companion papers, we investigate the infrared
spectral properties of the AGN (Armus et al. 2022, in
preparation), the starburst ring (Lai et al. 2022), and the
circumnuclear star-forming regions (Bohn et al. 2022) in
NGC 7469.

Throughout the paper, H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm
= 0.30, and Ωvac = 0.70 have been adopted. At the
redshift of z = 0.01627, 1(cid:48)(cid:48)= 330 pc (Wright 2006).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Mid-infrared IFS observations of NGC 7469 were
taken with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI;
Rieke et al. 2015; Labiano et al. 2021) in Medium Reso-
lution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode on 2022 July 3-4 UT
as part of the Early Release Science (ERS) Program
1328 (Co-PIs: L. Armus and A. Evans). The observa-
tions covered the full 4.9−28.8µm range using the short
(A), medium (B), and long (C) sub-bands in all four
channels. We adopted the FASTR1 readout pattern to
optimize the dynamic range expected in the observa-
tions. Using the extended source 4-pt dither pattern,
the science exposure time per sub-band was 444 sec-
onds. Because our source is extended, we linked the
observation to a dedicated background with the same
observational parameters in all three grating settings.

Uncalibrated science and background observations
were downloaded using the MAST Portal and processed
with the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline (Bushouse
et al. 2022) version 1.6+ in batch mode. The Detector1
pipeline applies detector-level corrections and ramp ﬁt-
ting to the individual exposures. The output rate images
were subsequently processed outside the JWST pipeline
to ﬂag newly-acquired bad pixels and additional cosmic
ray artifacts, and to remove vertical stripes and zero-
point residuals remaining after the pipeline dark sub-
traction. These additional corrections broadly follow the
steps taken for JWST ERO observations as described by
Pontoppidan et al. (2022). The resulting rate ﬁles are
then processed with the JWST Spec2 pipeline for dis-
tortion and wavelength calibration, ﬂux calibration, and
other 2d detector level steps. Residual fringe corrections

using prototype pipeline code have been applied to both
the Stage 2 products and to the 1-D spectra resulting
from Stage 3 processing.

Stage 3 processing (Spec3) performs background sub-
traction before combining data from multiple exposures
into the ﬁnal data cubes. Background light is subtracted
from the 2-D science images using a master background
frame generated from our associated background ob-
servations. The master background is a 1-D median
sigma-clipped spectrum calculated over the ﬁeld-of-view
(FOV) of the background observations and projected to
the entire 2-D detector array. Since it is a combination of
many detector pixels, it does not degrade the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) the way a pixel-by-pixel background
subtraction would. The cube-building step in Spec3 as-
sembles a single 3-D data cube from all of the individual
2-D calibrated detector images, combining data across
individual wavelength bands and channels.

NIRCam’s broadband F150W, F200W, and F444W
images of NGC 7469 from our ERS-1328 Program have
been included in this paper for visualization purposes.

processing details.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1. Emission Line Maps

In this paper, we focus our investigation on the Chan-
nel 1 MRS data (4.89µm to 7.66µm), which hosts key
diagnostic lines for shock excitation ([Fe II] and H2),
strength of the radiation ﬁeld ([Ar II]), and coronal re-
gion ([Mg V]) at the highest spatial resolution aﬀorded
by MRS at 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)3. Known issues with MRS wavelength
solutions (at the time of this writing) are generally
not a concern for Ch 1, where zeropoint variations at
the 0.001µm level (∼ 60 km s−1) are within the spec-
tral noise at these wavelengths. We ﬁt single Gaussian
proﬁles to three of the brightest ionized and molecu-
lar lines in Ch 1 ([Fe II] λ5.34µm, H2 S(5) λ6.91µm,
and [Ar II] λ6.99µm) on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis and
computed their corresponding ﬂux, velocity, and veloc-
ity dispersion maps using ifscube (Ruschel-Dutra &
Dall’Agnol De Oliveira 2020; Ruschel-Dutra et al. 2021).
We correct our linewidth measurements for instrumen-
tal broadening (σinst = 36.5 km s−1) by subtracting it
in quadrature.

As shown in Figure 1, the morphologies of the emission
lines diﬀer among these molecular and low-ionization po-
tential (IP) gases: [Fe II] (IP = 7.9 eV) and [Ar II] (IP
= 15.8 eV) are bright and compact at the nucleus and at
several star-forming clumps in the ring. The starburst
ring appears slightly asymmetric around the central nu-
cleus, where the southeast (SE) inner edge is closer to

4

U et al.

the AGN. In contrast, the H2 dominates and appears ex-
tended at the center but relatively weak in the ring. The
nuclear H2 emission is ∼1.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 across, nearly 5 times larger
than the FWHM of the point spread function (PSF) of
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 at 7.2µm continuum. Filamentary structures extend
in the NE and SW directions from the central emission
that appear to be well aligned with high surface bright-
ness CO gas (see Figure 2 in Izumi et al. 2020) at the
sites of the innermost spiral arms.

The gas kinematics for these lines are largely similar,
sharing a bulk rotational motion around the ring. The
kinematic major axis has a position angle (PA) of 126° as
measured using PaFit (Krajnovi´c et al. 2006). The mor-
phological semi-major axis (2.(cid:48)(cid:48)1) and semi-minor axis
(1.(cid:48)(cid:48)7) of the ring gives an inclination angle i = 51°.
The velocity ﬁeld is reminiscent of a tilted rotating ring
with the near (far) side in the E/NE (W/SW). We
compute the contribution to the velocity dispersion due
to rotation and beam smearing following the technique
from Swinbank et al. (2012); De Breuck et al. (2014):
we measure the luminosity-weighted velocity gradient
across the FWHM of the beam at each spaxel and sub-
tracted it from the velocity dispersion in quadrature.
For all these gases, the median eﬀect was at the 6%
level (∼ 4 km s−1), with 75% of the spaxels aﬀected un-
der 10% (∼ 7 km s−1) and 95% under 20% (∼ 14 km
s−1).

The H2 velocity dispersion is slightly suppressed at
the center (95 km s−1, or 75 km s−1 intrinsically) but
increases toward the NW direction in a cone shape, sim-
ilar to the shocked H2 λ2.12µm detected in Mrk 273 (U
et al. 2013). The [Fe II] gas, sensitive to strong shocks,
shows high velocity dispersions (reaching as high as 135
km s−1) roughly along the kinematic axis toward both
NW and SE.

3.2. Spectral Fits

To quantify the ISM conditions surrounding the AGN,
we divide the inner 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 (600 pc) ISM region within the
ring as seen at 7.1µm, the observed wavelength of [Ar II],
into a 3 × 3 grid and subsequently extract 1-D spec-
tra from these bins. Since the central region contains
a point source from the AGN, we apply a wavelength-
dependent aperture correction to the central spectrum.
The aperture correction is calculated using the MRS
PSF models from WebbPSF (Perrin et al. 2014) that
have been adjusted to match preliminary in-ﬂight per-
formance during JWST commissioning (private commu-
nication). These models are nearly diﬀraction limited
longward of 8µm and moderately elliptical at shorter
wavelengths. Figure 2 shows the extraction regions (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6
on a side) and their corresponding spectra normalized

at [Ar II]. The stitched Ch 1 short-medium-long spectra
exhibit a number of strong molecular and ﬁne structure
lines, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
features. Several of these emission lines were previously
seen with Spitzer /IRS, but with a large aperture that in-
cluded the starburst ring and the AGN (Stierwalt et al.
2013; Inami et al. 2013). The relatively poor spatial res-
olution of Spitzer precluded studies of the variations in
the strengths and proﬁle shapes of these lines with po-
sitions on these scales, now made possible with JWST.
Detailed discussions of the nuclear AGN spectrum and
of the dust grains in the star-forming ring are presented
in two companion papers (Armus et al. 2022, in prepa-
ration, Lai et al. 2022, respectively).

A handful of high-ionization lines ([Fe VIII] λ5.48µm with

IP = 124 eV, [Mg VII] λ5.50µm with IP = 186 eV, and
[Mg V] λ5.61µm with IP = 109 eV) show clear blue-
shifted wings. The coronal line [Mg V] is the strongest
among these features in all the 1-D spectra. Given
their high IPs, photo-ionized coronal lines are typically
produced on several hundred parsecs away from the
AGN (Ferguson et al. 1997). Kinematics of coronal
lines often reveal blueshifts indicating that outﬂows on
these scales are common (e.g. Riﬀel et al. 2021). While
strong coronal lines might be expected at the nucleus,
broad and blueshifted components may be present in
the immediate vicinity of the nucleus if an outﬂow is
present. Indeed, a close look at our extracted spectra
reveals that [Mg V] is most signiﬁcantly shifted in the E,
70 km s−1 with respect to the center (Figure 2 inset).
The blueshifted asymmetric proﬁle of [Mg V] can be
seen in several other directions as well.

To further investigate the distribution and kinemat-
ics of [Mg V], we ﬁt two Gaussian components using a
modiﬁed version of the Bayesian AGN Decomposition
Analysis for SDSS Spectra software package (BADASS;
Sexton et al. 2021) spaxel-by-spaxel and generate mo-
ment maps for the two components; see Appendix A.
The core, narrow component of [Mg V] is plausibly con-
sistent with rotation at the same PA as that for the
low-ionization and molecular gases. A broad compo-
nent is identiﬁed in a subset of the central spaxels, en-
compassing the blueshifted outﬂowing gas. The outﬂow
is detected up to a projected distance of ∼420 pc E of
the nucleus. Within this physical extent, the gas ex-
hibits a median line-of-sight velocity of vmed = −205
km s−1 but reaching as high as −650 km s−1 close to
the AGN. This outﬂow is also identiﬁed in other high-
ionization lines such as [Fe VIII] λ5.45µm (IP = 124 eV)
and [Ne VI] λ7.65µm (IP = 126 eV), and mid-ionization
lines such as [O IV] λ25.9µm (IP = 55 eV), the detailed
line proﬁles for which will be characterized in Armus

strikingly diﬀerent, with H2 being preferentially bright at the center while [Fe II] and [Ar II] appear clumpy at the star-forming
ring. H2 and [Fe II] exhibit enhanced dispersion ∼ 180 pc oﬀ the nucleus.

et al. 2022, in preparation. We do ﬁnd that the high
ionization lines in the nuclear spectrum exhibit extreme
blueshifted velocities upward of 1000 km s−1, indicating
the presence of very fast winds at the center.

Multi-component spectral ﬁtting is performed on the
full Ch 1 spectral coverage of each 1-D spectrum using
the Continuum And Feature Extraction (CAFE; Marshall
et al. 2007, D`ıaz-Santos et al. 2022, in preparation)
software package originally written in IDL for analyzing
Spitzer /IRS data. While individual atomic or molecu-
lar lines can be ﬁt using single or double Gaussian pro-
ﬁles, CAFE specializes in decomposing the emission in the
mid-infrared regime into AGN, PAHs, dust of diﬀerent
temperatures, and starburst components, and is ideal

for recovering properties of PAH features in 1-D spectra
that often require multiple components to ﬁt correctly.
The development of an improved version of the CAFE
code that handles high-resolution spectral decomposi-
tion is fully described in D`ıaz Santos et al. 2022, in
preparation). Major updates include a fully-functional
Python version applicable to the data format and spec-
tral resolution of JWST IFS data. The ﬂux densities for
the various relevant emission-line features are reported
in Table 1.

the inner ISM regions (except for NW and SW); its blueshifted ﬂux is most pronounced in the E.

4.1. Outﬂow Characteristics

As brieﬂy introduced in Section 1, previous multiwave-
length eﬀorts in the literature converged on the presence
of non-rotational kinematics in the circumnuclear region
of NGC 7469, but the picture of how the non-rotating
gas behaved at diﬀerent physical scales was incomplete
due to mismatches in observational parameters and data
sensitivity (M¨uller-S´anchez et al. 2011; Cazzoli et al.
2020; Robleto-Or´us et al. 2021). With JWST’s superb

sensitivity, spectral resolution, and integral-ﬁeld capa-
bility in the mid-infrared wavelengths, we can now in-
corporate the molecular, low- and high-ionization gases
into a coherent picture with the same data set on the
same physical scales. We see from Figure 2 that the high
IP [Mg V] line is prominently blueshifted, with a nearly
face-on geometry and ﬂux extending E of the nucleus.

Note—All ﬂux densities are in units of 10−23 W m−2 pc−2. The aperture used for the grid extraction is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 × 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6. Pfα is not

well detected at the center and thus its measurement is omitted.

Figure A.2 (lower left panel) is overplotted on the NIR-
CAM images as contours in Figure 3 (inset).

Given that the gas is photoionized and [Mg V] is trac-
ing the illumination pattern, we see primarily the blue-
shifted outﬂowing gas coming toward us from a nearly
face-on galaxy with inclination angle of 45° (Davies
et al. 2004), which is consistent with our measured i of
51° based on the ring structure. The [Mg V] observations
further support the picture in which the circumnuclear
obscuration is roughly in the same plane as the galaxy’s
large-scale disk.

To place our ﬁndings in the context of literature re-
sults, we consider the scales of the outﬂows detected
with diﬀerent instruments and tracers. Robleto-Or´us
et al. (2021) found an outﬂow as characterized by
blueshifted [O III] λ5007˚A extending 531 pc from the
nucleus. Resolved at similar scales as our MIRI/MRS
data, the [O III] outﬂow may be more extended than the
coronal wind we detect in [Mg V] because it is more eas-
ily excited (with IP = 35 eV) and more extincted at the
center. On the other hand, the biconically-illuminated
[Si VI] λ1.96µm outﬂow presented by M¨uller-S´anchez
et al. (2011) has an E-W orientation, but at much
smaller scale close to the AGN. The entire [Si VI] emis-
sion (IP = 167 eV) falls within the central 1−2 spaxels
of MIRI/MRS. The mid-infrared coronal outﬂow we ﬁnd
could have physical connection with the X-ray warm ab-
sorber in this AGN in terms of location and ionization
condition (Blustin et al. 2007). Our results suggest a
scenario where the high-ionization outﬂow detected by
JWST likely bridges the nuclear-scale (< 100 pc) coro-
nal line region outﬂow and the larger-scale narrow line
region winds. The outﬂow appears one-sided because
it is approaching us nearly face-on; the projected size
of a potentially receding red-side cone behind the AGN

may be too small to be spatially resolved by MIRI (Fig-
ure 3). Even though there may be a hint of a redshifted
wing in the W spectrum (Figure 2), the SNR is too weak
in the individual spaxels for a robust spectral ﬁt. The
redshifted wind may simply be obscured by dense, inter-
vening ISM. Alternatively, the outﬂow may also appear
asymmetric if an inclined jet is pushing on the gas in
the disk (e.g. in NGC 1052; Fern´andez-Ontiveros et al.
2019). While NGC 7469 may host a radio core–jet struc-
ture as resolved by the Very Large Array (Orienti & Pri-
eto 2010), no evidence of radio jet–ISM interaction has
yet been found in its nuclear region (Xu & Wang 2022).

4.2. ISM excitation

Our MIRI/MRS observations allow us, for the ﬁrst
time, to examine the high-ionization outﬂow identiﬁed
here in [Mg V] at r < 300 pc in detail. We search for
evidence that indicates how the outﬂow may impact its
surroundings. The mid-infrared rotational transitions of
H2, when coupled with measurements of the PAH emis-
sion, provide a robust diagnostic of the excitation con-
ditions and help determine the mechanism responsible
for exciting the H2 lines (Higdon et al. 2006; Ogle et al.
2010; Guillard et al. 2012; Cluver et al. 2013). Young
massive stars may heat both PAHs and H2 in photodis-
sociation regions (PDRs), but shocks arising from out-
ﬂows or X-ray emission from AGN eﬀectively dissociate
PAH molecules and small grains (Jones et al. 1996). Em-
pirically, low-luminosity star-forming galaxies exhibit a
limited range of luminosity ratio L(H2)/L(PAH) over
several orders of magnitude in L(H2) while those for
AGN display line ratios ∼15 times greater (Roussel et al.
2007). Thus, the line ratio L(H2)/L(PAH) has been
used to distinguish between AGN, stars, and shocks as
the driver of molecular emission in extreme environ-

most of which is coming toward us from the central AGN with a slight eastward extension. (Right) A cartoon schematic showing
a nearly face-on outﬂow that appears one-sided and mostly in blueshift (blue cone). The inclined star-forming ring (near side

ments such as LIRGs (Stierwalt et al. 2014; U et al.
2019).

Ideally, the total power in the warm H2 and all forms
of PAH lines should be used in any analysis of PDR
heating, given that the bulk of the molecular gas mass
may be traced by the lower rotational H2 transitions.
However, to take advantage of the high spatial reso-
lution in MIRI Ch 1 and minimize contamination in
the inner ISM region from the nucleus and the ring,
we opt to conﬁne our analysis of L(H2)/L(PAH) to the
lines present in this channel, recognizing the potential
limitations.
In Ch 1 MRS data cube (Figure 2), four
H2 transitions are identiﬁed: S(5) λ6.91µm is detected
and appears prominent in all the extracted spectra; S(6)
λ6.11µm, while detected, sits on top of a prominent PAH
feature at 6.2µm and may be dominated by PAHs at cer-
tain locations; S(7) λ5.51µm may be partially blended
with [Mg VII] λ5.5µm; and S(8) λ5.05µm is compar-
atively weak. For these reasons, the S(5) line is the
most optimal line among the possibilities. Its proximity
to PAH6.2µm reduces the risk of potential calibration

diﬀerences between sub-bands and diﬀerential extinc-
tion, so we focus on using this pair of features for the
L(H2)/L(PAH) diagnostic. We note that close to the
AGN (< 300 pc), the H2 gas is expected to be quite
hot (∼ 900-1100K; Pereira-Santaella et al. 2022; Lam-
brides et al. 2019) and is dominated by AGN heating in
the central ∼100 pc (Armus et al. 2022, in preparation),
so the S(5) line likely carries much of the H2 luminos-
ity, justifying our reliance on this line to measure the
L(H2)/L(PAH) ratio.

Figure 4 (left) shows the L(H2)/L(PAH) distribu-
tion versus H2 luminosity density for the diﬀerent lo-
cations within the inner ISM. The ﬁrst result is that
the corner points (NW, NE, SE, and SW) all have lower
L(H2)/L(PAH) ratios than the other locations. Exam-
ining the spectra in Figure 2, the PAH features are more
prominent at the corner locations that contain a larger
fractional emission from the ring than at the E-W or
N-S locations. This is expected, since PAH emission
mostly originates from PDRs and, for some galaxy pop-
ulations and/or environments, can be used as star for-

mation rate tracers (e.g. Peeters et al. 2004).
In con-
trast, the H2 emission is relatively weaker in the ring,
as seen in Figure 1, in agreement with what is expected
from actively star-forming regions.

For comparison, we have plotted in Figure 4 the in-
tegrated Spitzer /IRS data points for a sample of local
LIRGs (Stierwalt et al. 2014) from the Great Obser-
vatories All-sky LIRGs Survey (GOALS; Armus et al.
2009). Because the angular-size aperture (3.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 × 9.(cid:48)(cid:48)5)
used to extract the Spitzer /IRS spectra is much larger
than that of our extraction grid size, we show the
H2 luminosity surface density, ΣH2, in the x-axis in-
stead of luminosity, for a more direct comparison with
the Spitzer /IRS values. Our data points span a broad
range in L(H2)/L(PAH) of the GOALS LIRGs, and are
consistent with the more H2 bright sources for a given
L(H2)/L(PAH) value. This shift may be due to the fact
that the global values from Spitzer /IRS are uniformly
weighted and encompass many star-forming regions and
obscured AGN sources, while our resolved data points
represent the inner ISM region close to the Seyfert nu-
cleus in NGC 7469 where H2 is prominently detected.

The inner ISM region does not host bright star-
forming regions and therefore PDR models are not ap-
plicable, but X-rays from the AGN and shocks from the
outﬂow can heat the molecular gas (Petric et al. 2018;
Minsley et al. 2020). Since iron is highly depleted onto
grains, [Fe II] is a commonly adopted tracer of shock-
excited gas where grains have been processed by out-
ﬂows or other ionizing sources (see references in reviews
by Sajina et al. 2022; U 2022). Infrared studies of super-
nova remnants indicate that not only do they produce
H2 lines as luminous as bright star-forming regions, they
are also associated with enhanced [Fe II]/Brγ relative to
typical H II regions (Oliva et al. 1989). The latter obser-
vation has been predicted by theoretical models of shock
fronts (McKee et al. 1984), where the ratio of [Fe II]-to-
Hydrogen is deemed a useful indicator of the eﬃciency
of the shock front in destroying dust grains (Hollen-
bach & McKee 1989). Here, we examine the ratio of
L([Fe II])/L(Pfα) given that the H recombination line
Pfund α traces star formation, provides a calibration
baseline, and is detected in Ch 1.

Figure 4 (right) shows L(H2)/L(PAH) plotted as a
function of L([Fe II])/L(Pfα), which appears to be
well correlated with the exception of the SW region.
We compute a correlation for all the data points us-
ing pymccorrelation (Privon et al. 2020) with 104
bootstrapping iterations to estimate the uncertainties.
We determine the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient ρ
= 0.62+0.26
−0.40, with a p-value of 0.10 driven mostly by
the outlier point at SW and the large uncertainties

of Pfα.
If we exclude SW (which shows the peakiest
PAH6.2µm proﬁle and the most extreme slope on the
red end of the Ch1 spectra where Pfα is located; see Fig-
ure 2), the resulting coeﬃcient becomes ρ = 0.86+0.09
−0.19,
with a p-value of 0.01, suggesting that [Fe II] and H2 at
the W and N locations are likely excited by the same
shocks driven by the outﬂow. This correlation between
[Fe II] and H2 in (U)LIRGs has been studied by Hill &
Zakamska (2014), who also inferred that shocks, includ-
ing AGN-driven ones, are the likely source of H2 heating.
The most extreme region, W, which partially over-
laps the region of high H2 and [Fe II] velocity dispersion
(Figure 1), is, interestingly, on the opposite side of the

that the H2 and [Fe II] are regions of high velocity dis-
persion represent regions where the receding, partially
obscured part of the outﬂow is plowing into the dense
ISM and releasing [Fe II] into the gas phase. A strong
correlation between [Fe II] and H2 may be associated
with sites of supernova remnants, where [Fe II] is pro-
duced in radiative shocks after grain destruction as the
supernova remnant propagates (Hill & Zakamska 2014).
Given the extremely high-velocity coronal line compo-
nents detected in the nuclear spectrum (Armus et al.
2022, in preparation), the AGN itself is likely driving
the highly-ionized wind detected here in [Mg V], which
deposits energy into the ISM via shocks in the W and
NW regions where the dispersion of the warm molec-
ular gas and the L(H2)/L(PAH) ratios are highest. It
is somewhat surprising, given the location of the high
dispersion H2 gas, that the NW spectrum is low in Fig-
ure 4 (left). However, this extraction region is large and
partially intersects the inner edge of the ring, where the
H2 is weak and the PAH is bright. Examining the indi-
vidual pixels in this region indicates the L(H2)/L(PAH)
ratio changes by a factor of eight as one moves from the
upper right to lower left of this region. Therefore the
area of maximum dispersion in the NW would indeed
be located much higher in Figure 4, close to the position
of region W, consistent with our simple model. A more
detailed analysis of these regions will be performed in
a subsequent paper using a spectral decomposition tool
designed to produce accurate line ratio maps on ﬁner
scales.

5. SUMMARY

In this Letter, we present new JWST MIRI MRS ob-
servations of NGC 7469 and focus on the analysis of
the inner ISM region between the central AGN and the
starburst ring. The high spatial- and spectral-resolution
available with the new IFS capability of MIRI enables
a detailed investigation of the rotational H2, low- and

diﬀerent parts of the inner ISM region. The grey points are local LIRGs from Stierwalt et al. (2014) for which these line
transitions are detected and H2 luminosities normalized by the extraction aperture; upper limits have been excluded. The inner
ISM in NGC 7469 tends to be bright in H2 but spans a range of L(H2)/L(PAH) values nearly representative of the local LIRGs.
(Right) The same L(H2)/L(PAH) line ratios plotted against L([Fe II])/L(Pfα). The correlation seen here (ρ = 0.62+0.26
−0.40 with
a p-value of 0.10 for all the points; ρ = 0.86+0.09
−0.19, with a p-value of 0.01 excluding the SW outlier) suggests that shocks traced
by [Fe II] are correlated with the shocked H2 gas. Pfα is not well detected in the central spectrum and thus the center point is
excluded from this plot.

Such a detailed view of the mid-infrared gas dynam-
ics within the central region of a dusty LIRG nucleus
is made possible for the ﬁrst time, fully demonstrat-
ing the high spatial- and spectral-resolution plus high-
sensitivity integral-ﬁeld capability of JWST.

high-ionization ﬁne structure lines, and dust features at
mid-infrared wavelengths for the ﬁrst time. We summa-
rize our ﬁndings below.

• The morphology of the low-ionization [Fe II] and
[Ar II]
lines are bright on the nucleus and in
the starburst ring, showing several star-forming
clumps and regions of enhanced emission. The
H2, in contrast, is strongly peaked on the nucleus
and surrounding ISM, and is relatively weak in the
starburst ring.

• The [Mg V] emission line is resolved, and shows a
broad, blueshifted component that is likely asso-
ciated with the coronal line outﬂow in NGC 7469.
The blueshifted highly-ionized outﬂow traced by
[Mg V], has a nearly face-on geometry that is
strongly peaked on the nucleus, with an exten-
sion that reaches about 400 pc to the East. The
[Mg V] gas has a median line-of-sight velocity
vmed = −205 km s−1 and reaches as high as −650
km s−1 close to the AGN.

• There are regions of enhanced velocity disper-
sion in H2 and [Fe II] ∼180 pc from the AGN
that also feature excited L([Fe II])/L(Pfα) and
L(H2)/L(PAH) ratios, most clearly seen to the N
and W. We identify these regions as the locations
where the outﬂow is depositing energy into the
dense interstellar gas via shocks, between the nu-
cleus and the starburst ring.

APPENDIX

A. FITTING THE CORONAL LINE

As mentioned in Section 2, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the coronal line [Mg V] over the entire Ch1 FOV
using the BADASS (Sexton et al. 2021) software package. We ﬁt one- and two-component Gaussian proﬁles to the
line spaxel-by-spaxel (e.g. Figure A.1) and generate their resulting ﬂux, velocity, and velocity dispersion maps (Figure
A.2). The velocity dispersion maps have been corrected for instrumental broadening (σinst = 36.5 km s−1). The ﬂux
map of the secondary broad component of [Mg V] (bottom left panel of Figure A.2) is overplotted on NIRCam images
as contours in Figure 3 to indicate the high-ionization outﬂow.

We note that this two-component spectral ﬁtting was only applied to [Mg V] on a per-spaxel basis in this work to
generate the moment maps. In a companion paper (Armus et al. 2022, in preparation), multi-component ﬁtting is
applied to all the emission lines in the full MIRI/MRS nuclear spectrum extracted from a small aperture on the AGN.
