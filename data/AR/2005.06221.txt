ABSTRACT

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the evolutionary phases of a major M6.6 long
duration event (LDE) with special emphasize on its pre-ﬂare phase. The event occurred in NOAA
12371 on 2015 June 22. A remarkable aspect of the event was an active pre-ﬂare phase lasting for
about an hour during which a hot EUV coronal channel was in build-up stage and displayed co-spatial
hard X-ray (HXR) emission up to energies of 25 keV. As such, this is the ﬁrst evidence of HXR
coronal channel. The coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration based on NLFFF modeling clearly exhibited
a magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) oriented along the polarity inversion line (PIL) and co-spatial with the
coronal channel. We observed signiﬁcant changes in the AR’s photospheric magnetic ﬁeld during an
extended period of ≈42 hours in the form of rotation of sunspots, moving magnetic features, and ﬂux
cancellation along the PIL. Prior to the ﬂare onset, the MFR underwent a slow rise phase (≈14 km
s−1) for ≈12 min which we attribute to the faster build-up and activation of the MFR by tether-
cutting reconnection occurring at multiple locations along the MFR itself. The sudden transition in
the kinematic evolution of the MFR from the phase of slow to fast rise (≈109 km s−1 with acceleration
≈110 m s−2) precisely divides the pre-ﬂare and impulsive phase of the ﬂare, which points toward the
feedback process between the early dynamics of the eruption and the strength of the ﬂare magnetic
reconnection.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar eruptions are complex phenomena with multiple facets right from their genesis in the solar atmosphere to
subsequent consequences in the near-Sun, interplanetary, and near-Earth regions (Gopalswamy et al. 2001; Webb &
Howard 2012; Archontis & Vlahos 2019). Decades of observational and theoretical research has elucidated diﬀerent
aspects of it, namely, solar ﬂares, eruptive prominences, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), coronal jets, etc., which are
observationally deﬁned as disjoint terms but occur as a result of physically coupled processes (e.g., see reviews by
Priest & Forbes 2002; Fletcher et al. 2011). Exploration of solar eruptive phenomena using multi-wavelength, multi-
instrument, and multi-point observations is key toward better understanding of the origin and prediction of space
weather events (Koskinen et al. 2017; Green et al. 2018).

The source regions of solar eruptions frequently show the presence of interesting observational features, e.g., promi-
nences, ﬁlament channels, hot coronal channels, etc., which have been accepted as evidences of a fundamental structure

called magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) (Cheng et al. 2011; Patsourakos et al. 2013; Joshi et al. 2017; Mitra et al. 2018; Veronig
et al. 2018). MFRs are often deﬁned as a bundle of magnetic ﬁeld lines that are twisted around each other and wrap
around a common axis (Gibson & Fan 2006; Canou & Amari 2010; Filippov et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2017). MFRs not
only play a crucial role in triggering the eruption but also constitute a key component of CMEs. Near-Earth in-situ
measurements often reveal evidence of MFRs at large-scales in the form of interplanetary magnetic clouds signifying
the arrival of Earth-directed CMEs (Burlaga et al. 1981; Klein & Burlaga 1982; Burlaga et al. 1998; M¨ostl et al.
2009; Syed Ibrahim et al. 2019), that may subsequently cause geomagnetic disturbances when interacting with Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld (Zhang & Burlaga 1988; Burlaga et al. 2001; Zurbuchen & Richardson 2006; Bisoi et al. 2016; Joshi
et al. 2018). Here some basic questions arise: how do MFRs originate in the solar corona and what are the mechanisms
responsible for their eruptions? The analysis of multi-wavelength solar observations of the source regions of CMEs and
their comparison with coronal magnetic ﬁeld modeling yield important insights on these open issues.

The formation of a CME requires the activation and successful eruption of the MFR against solar gravity and the
overlying coronal magnetic ﬁeld. According to the “standard ﬂare model” also known as CSHKP model (Carmichael
1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), the eruptive expansion of the unstable MFR creates
strong inﬂow of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld lines in the large-scale current sheet that is formed underneath it causing
the onset of magnetic reconnection. During magnetic reconnection, the stored magnetic energy is released in the
form of intense heating within a localized region as well as acceleration of plasma and high-energy particles (Priest &
Forbes 2002; Holman et al. 2011). The spatio-temporal characteristics of a solar ﬂare explored from multi-wavelength
and multi-band measurements provide useful information about the origin of the non-thermal and thermal emissions
(Fletcher et al. 2011; Benz 2017). These observations also pose constraints on the standard ﬂare model (Sui et al.
2004; Veronig & Brown 2004; Joshi et al. 2012).

It has been observed that many ﬂares are associated with pre-ﬂare and precursor activities, which include small-scale
brightness enhancements in the ﬂaring region of about a few to tens of minutes prior to its impulsive phase (Veronig
et al. 2002; Kundu et al. 2004; Joshi et al. 2011, 2013; Mitra et al. 2020). While the precursor phase often shows a
direct link to the later eruptive phenomenon, the pre-ﬂare activity is viewed as a single or multiple series of small-scale
reconnection events within the active region and may indirectly support the eruption by changing the magnetic and
plasma conditions favorably (F´arn´ık et al. 1996; F´arn´ık & Savy 1998; Chifor et al. 2006; Joshi et al. 2011, 2013; Mitra
& Joshi 2019). Arguably the observations of pre-ﬂare or precursor activity have potential to provide insight on the
build-up phase of MFR and the triggering mechanism of the subsequent solar eruption.

During 2015 June 15–29, AR NOAA 12371 passed over the solar visible disk and produced several eruptive ﬂares
including geoeﬀective ones. The long-duration event of GOES class M6.6/Hα importance 2B occurred on 2015 June
22 is of particular interest in view of the highly eventful and extended pre-ﬂare phase, its dual peak main phase, as
well as the very distinct observations of the MFR structure and overlying strapping ﬁeld in the AIA EUV ﬁltergrams.
This event has been the subject of several studies. Jing et al. (2017) reported on the large-scale dynamics associated
with the ﬂare. They noted propagation of footpoint brightening driven by injection of non-thermal particles and
the apparent slippage of loops governed by plasma heating and subsequent cooling. Wang et al. (2018) studied the
changes in photospheric ﬂows and magnetic ﬁeld structures associated with the ﬂare. Their study reveals the role of
back reaction of the coronal ﬁelds as caused by the ﬂare energy release. Awasthi et al. (2018) analyzed the pre-ﬂare
conﬁguration and identiﬁed a multiple braided ﬂux rope along the PIL with diﬀerent degrees of coherency over the
pre-ﬂare phase. Liu et al. (2018a) analyzed the changes in the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld, which are related to
the motion of the ﬂare ribbons. Kang et al. (2019) reported the involvement of ideal instabilities (double arc instability
and torus instability) and tether-cutting mechanism as plausible cause of the eruption of the ﬂux rope and subsequent
M6.6 ﬂare.

In this study, we revisit SOL2015-06-22T18:23 to investigate the processes occurring during the extended period
prior to the onset of eruption, the pre-ﬂare activity while the quasi-stable MFR continued to build up, and how these
processes relate to the subsequent impulsive phase when the MFR underwent spectacular eruption that led to a fast
halo CME. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief discussion about observational data and
techniques. Section 3 provides an extensive exploration of the multi-wavelength data in (E)UV, X-ray, and optical
bands along with analysis of photosphetic magnetograms. The results are discussed in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND TECHNIQUES

This study is primarily based on data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and
Heliosesmic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell
et al. 2012). AIA records full-disk images of the corona and transition region up to 0.5 R(cid:12) above the photosphere in
EUV and UV ﬁlters. It produces narrow band images centered on speciﬁc lines corresponding to seven EUV passbands:
They are 94 ˚A (Fe XVIII), 131 ˚A (Fe VIII, XXI), 171 ˚A (Fe IX), 193 ˚A (Fe XII, XXIV), 211 ˚A (Fe XIV), 304 ˚A (He II), and
335 ˚A (Fe XVI). UV observations are made at 1600 ˚A (C IV) and 1700 ˚A (nearby continuum). AIA produces 4096 ×
4096 pixel images at a pixel resolution of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 pixel−1 with a temporal cadence of 12 s for the EUV ﬁlters and 24 s for
the UV ﬁlters. In this study, we have extensively analyzed the observations taken in the 94 ˚A (log T=6.8) and the 304
˚A (log T=4.7) channels besides examining images at other AIA channels.

HMI provides full disk measurements of the intensity, doppler shift, line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld, and vector
magnetic ﬁeld at the solar photosphere using the 6173 ˚A Fe I absorption line. Images are produced with 4096 × 4096
pixel at a pixel resolution of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 pixel−1 and a temporal cadence of 45 s for velocity, intensity, and LOS magnetic ﬁeld.
For the vector magnetic ﬁeld, the temporal cadence is 720 s. In order to compare the images from HMI with AIA, we
use the SSW routine hmi prep.pro, which converts the resolution of the HMI images from 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 pixel−1 to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 pixel−1,
which is the pixel resolution of AIA.

The Hα images studied are full disk observations from Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) (Denker et al. 1999)
with a telescope aperture of 10 cm. These Hα observations are taken with a ﬁlter of 0.25 ˚A bandpass centered at the
Hα line core and 2048×2048 pixel CCD camera. The images have a temporal cadence of ≈60 s and pixel resolution
≈1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0.

The temporal, spatial, and spectral evolution of the hard X-ray (HXR) emission from the ﬂaring region is analyzed
using data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002). RHESSI
observed the full Sun with an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution (as ﬁne as ∼2(cid:48)(cid:48).3) and energy resolution
(1–10 keV) in the energy range 3 keV to 17 MeV. To reconstruct RHESSI HXR images at diﬀerent energy bands, we
have used the CLEAN algorithm (Hurford et al. 2002). For HXR spectroscopy, we generated RHESSI spectra with
an energy binning of 1/3 keV from 6 to 15 keV, 1 keV from 15 to 100 keV, and 5 keV from 100 keV onward. We only
used front segments of the detectors, and excluded detectors 2 and 7 (which have lower energy resolution and high
threshold energies, respectively; Smith et al. (2002)). The spectra were deconvolved with the full detector response
matrix. Two ﬁtting models have been used: line emission from an isothermal plasma and thick-target bremsstrahlung
from non-thermal electrons interacting with the chromosphere (Holman et al. 2003). From spectral ﬁts, we derived the
temperature (T) and emission measure (EM) of the hot ﬂaring plasma, as well as the non-thermal electron spectral
index (δ) for the non-thermal component.

The CME associated with the M6.6 ﬂare under study was observed by the C2 and C3 instruments of the Large Angle
and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995). C2 and C3 are white light coronagraphs that image the solar corona with a ﬁeld-of-view
of 1.5 to 6 R(cid:12) and 3.7 to 30 R(cid:12), respectively.

To model the coronal magnetic ﬁeld distribution, we used hmi.sharp cea 720s series vector magnetogram of
SDO/HMI as input boundary condition. The magnetogram is remapped using a Lambert cylindrical equal-area pro-
jection and presented as (Br,Bθ,Bφ) in heliocentric spherical coordinates corresponding to (Bz,By,Bx) in heliographic
coordinates (Sun 2013). The magnetogram represents an area of 474 × 226 pixel2 of the AR, which corresponds to
an area of 343 × 163 Mm2 on the surface of the Sun. The extrapolation was done upto a height of 163 Mm above
the photosphere. To visualize the extrapolated ﬁeld lines, we used Visualization and Analysis Platform for Ocean,
Atmosphere, and Solar Researchers (VAPOR1; Clyne et al. 2010) software.

3.1. Event overview and light curve analysis

We investigate an M6.6 class ﬂare from AR NOAA 12371 on 2015 June 22 from 16:00 UT to 23:00 UT. The active
region was situated at heliographic coordinate ≈N12W08 during the onset of the ﬂare.
In Figure 1, we present a

Two distinct peaks (P1 and P2) are observed in

UT.

17:35 – 18:51 A distinct subpeak at ≈17:44 UT in X-ray light
curves (GOES and RHESSI) during the rise phase
(17:35 – 18:00 UT); broad maximum phase with
dual peak structures (F1 and F2) in GOES light
curves at ≈18:00 UT and ≈18:13 UT; eruption of
hot channel begins at ≈17:40 UT; CME ﬁrst de-
tected in LASCO C2 coronagraph at ≈18:36 UT.
18:51 – 21:00 Very gradual decline of SXR emission in GOES
light curves for ≈2 hours; after which the SXR
ﬂux reached to pre-ﬂare background level; emis-
sion from large post-ﬂare loops.

Post-ﬂare phase

white light image of the active region shows two distinct sunspot groups (shown by dashed boxes in Figure 1(a)). A
comparison of white light image with LOS magnetogram of the active region suggests that the leading sunspot group
is of negative polarity and the trailing sunspot group is comprised of mixed polarity regions making it a βγ type active
region (cf. Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The ﬂaring site is located over the trailing sunspot group (shown by yellow dashed
box in Figure 1(b)). The AIA 94 ˚A image during the pre-ﬂare phase (Figure 1(c)) suggests that, the activity site
was associated with intensely emitting closed loops, which we mark by a dotted rectangle and annotate as hot core.
Furthermore, we identify a hot channel-like structure at low coronal heights (marked by yellow arrow as hot EUV
channel). By examining the images in the AIA 94 ˚A channel prior to the event over several hours, we ﬁnd that, the
hot channel pre-existed at least ≈5.5 hours before the eruptive ﬂare. A comparison of the AIA 94 ˚A image with a
co-temporal HMI magnetogram suggests that the brightest part of the core region with dense coronal loops essentially
lie over the trailing part of the active region showing a complex bipolar magnetic distribution of sunspots. The 171 ˚A
image in Figure 1(d) shows high coronal loops connecting the leading and trailing sunspot groups. In Figure 1(e), the
AIA 304 ˚A image shows the signature of a ﬁlament channel. In Figure 1(f), the BBSO Hα image clearly shows the
ﬁlament channel over polarity inversion line (PIL) (cf. Figures 1(b) and (f)). We infer the hot EUV channel to be the
coronal counterpart of the chromospheric ﬁlament delineating the PIL of the trailing bipolar part of the active region.
The GOES soft X-ray (SXR) light curves in 1–8 ˚A and 0.5–4 ˚A (Figure 2(a)), show distinct pre-ﬂare, main, and
gradual phases of the long duration ﬂare event under study. We see two distinct peaks in the pre-ﬂare phase (P1 and
P2) at ≈16:45 UT and ≈17:26 UT. A sharp rise in the GOES SXR ﬂux at ≈17:35 UT indicates the start of main phase
of the M6.6 ﬂare with dual peak structures (F1 and F2) at ≈18:00 UT and ≈18:13 UT. According to the GOES ﬂare
catalog, which is based on the return of the SXR ﬂux to half of its peak value, the ﬂare lasted till 18:51 UT. However,
the GOES proﬁles (Figure 2(a)) clearly reveal enhanced soft X-ray emission from the ﬂaring region for several hours
(≈up to 21:00 UT), that we mark as prolonged decay phase. In Table 1, we summarize the diﬀerent phases of the ﬂare
evolution along with their characteristics, which we discuss in subsequent sections.

Normalized intensity light curves of the AIA channels 171 ˚A, 304 ˚A, 94 ˚A, and 1600 ˚A ﬁlters are shown in Figure
2(b). In general, these (E)UV light curves show similar trends than the GOES SXR light curves with some time delays
in the peak emission among diﬀerent bands. The ﬁrst peak P1 of the GOES light curve in 0.5–4 ˚A channel is not seen
in the AIA light curves; while the second peak P2 is clearly visible (shown by dotted lines in Figure 2(b)). The 94 ˚A
light curve shows a signiﬁcant time-shift in the peak compared to other AIA light curves and continued emission for a
longer period (up to 21:00 UT). The AIA 171 ˚A light curve shows signiﬁcant variability in the decay phase, which is
not seen in other AIA light curves. The 1600 ˚A light curve shows dual peak structure in the main phase of the M6.6
ﬂare similar to GOES light curves.

ﬁnd two stages in the pre-ﬂare phase that peak at 16:45 UT (marked as P1) and 17:26 UT (marked as P2), respectively. We
also observe dual ﬂare-peak structure in the main phase of the M6.6 ﬂare, indicated as F1 and F2 at 18:00 UT and 18:13 UT,
respectively. Panel (b): AIA light curves normalized by peak intensity of respective AIA ﬁlters. For clear view, light curves
have been scaled by factors of 0.55 and 0.8 for 94 ˚A and 304 ˚A channels, respectively. The peak P2 in GOES soft X-ray light
curves in the pre-ﬂare phase corresponds to a peak in AIA light curves, which is shown by dotted line. We readily observe that,
the structure of the active region shows signiﬁcant changes during the course of the ﬂare. As a comparison between pre- and
post-ﬂare phases, we plot the active region corona in AIA 94 ˚A (cf. panels (c) and (d)), 304 ˚A (cf. panels (e) and (f)), and in
171 ˚A (cf. panels (g) and (h)).

6–12, 12–25, and 25–50 keV with a time cadence of 4 s. GOES SXR light curves in 1–8 ˚A and 0.5–4 ˚A channels are also shown
by dashed and solid lines, respectively. The hatched regions denote unavailability of solar X-ray data due to RHESSI night (N)
and South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). Diﬀerent attenuator states (A0, A1, and A3) are shown by horizontal bars at the top.

In Figure 2, we provide a comparison of the active region corona during the pre- and post-ﬂare phases of the ﬂare as
recorded in diﬀerent SDO/AIA channels; namely: in 94 ˚A (cf. Figures 2(c)–(d)), in 304 ˚A (cf. Figures 2(e)–(f)), and
in 171 ˚A (cf. Figures 2(g)-(h)). In the pre-ﬂare stage, we observe low lying coronal loops with a faint signature of a hot
coronal channel underlying the low coronal loops in the 94 ˚A image (Figure 2(c)). In the post-ﬂare stage, dense and
bright post-ﬂare loops are observed to be formed (Figure 2(d)). In AIA 304 ˚A, we observe the signature of ﬁlament
in pre-ﬂare stage (Figure 2(e)), whose eruption gives rise to formation of post-ﬂare loop arcades (Figure 2(f)). In the
post-ﬂare stage, AIA 171 ˚A observations also reveal the formation of dense post-ﬂare loop arcades (Figure 2(h)).

In Figure 3, we show RHESSI X-ray count rates in diﬀerent energy bands from 3–100 keV in the interval of 16:30
UT to 18:35 UT. The co-temporal GOES SXR light curves in 1–8 ˚A and 0.5–4 ˚A are overplotted on the RHESSI count
rates. We observe simultaneous occurrence of peaks in GOES SXR and lower energy RHESSI (<25 keV) light curves
in the pre-ﬂare stage (from ≈16:30 UT to ≈17:35 UT). In the main phase of the ﬂare (from ≈17:35 UT onward), the
higher energy RHESSI (>25 keV) light curves show distinct small peaks.

To show the overall evolution of the M6.6 ﬂare, we present a few representative Hα images in Figure 4, which are
obtained from BBSO. At the pre-ﬂare stage, we observe the presence of a ﬁlament channel along the PIL of the active
region (shown by purple arrows in Figure 4(a)). During the early stage of the main phase of the ﬂare, we observe
activation of the ﬁlament channel in two diﬀerent directions: along the length of the channel toward southwest (shown
by blue arrows in Figure 4(d)) and along northwest direction (shown by green arrows in Figure 4(d)). The ﬁlament
continued to erupt along the northwest direction and produced intense ﬂare brightening (Figures 4(e)–(f)). The two-

phase, and post-ﬂare phase in panels (a)–(c), (d)–(f), and (g)–(i), respectively. Two distinct parts of the ﬁlament (shown by
purple arrows in panel (a)), together constitute a ﬁlament channel. The onset of M6.6 ﬂare is preceded by activation of the
ﬁlament channel in two diﬀerent directions (shown by blue and green arrows in panel (d); For details, see Section 3.1). An
upward motion of ﬁlament material is observed during the post-ﬂare phase, which is shown by red arrows in panels (g)–(i).

step activation of the ﬁlament channel may be associated with the pre-ﬂare activities that led to the partial eruption
of the ﬁlament. In the post-ﬂare phase, we identify a ﬁlamentary material to be erupted from the core part of the
ﬂaring region, which is shown by red arrows in Figures 4(g)–(i).

The eruption of the hot channel and the subsequent ﬂare resulted into a fast halo CME, which was observed by
C2 and C3 coronagraphs of LASCO on-board SOHO (Figure 5). Various CME parameters have been gathered from

3.2. Structure and evolution of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld

Coronal magnetic conﬁgurations are deeply associated with changes of photospheric magnetic structures. Therefore,
to understand the cause of ﬂaring activities and ﬁlament eruptions, it is essential to study the changes associated
with the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds. The magnetic structure of the AR 12371, one day prior to the event under
investigation (i.e., 21 June 2015), is shown in Figure 6(a). The magnetic structure of the same AR just before the event
is shown in Figure 6(b). A comparison of panels (a) and (b) reveals that the two sub-regions R1 and R2 underwent
signiﬁcant changes (see animation attached with Figure 6). In order to further probe the magnetic changes, a few
representative magnetograms of the sub-region R1 from 2015 June 21 to 2015 June 22 are shown in panels R1(a)–R1(e)
of Figure 6. A light bridge (marked by yellow arrow) is noticeable, which gradually underwent apparent rotation in
clockwise direction. This light bridge separated the negative polarity sunspot and showed an increase in its width.
White arrows show motion of a negative polarity region toward southwest (cf. Figures 6R1(a)–R1(e)). Blue arrows
show southward motion of another negative polarity region within sub-region R1.

In the ﬁrst two panels of the LOS magnetograms of the R2 region, the sky blue arrows show an island of negative
polarity region, which eventually merged into the major negative polarity region north of it (cf. Figures 6R2(a)-R2(b)).
Notably, the eastern part of R2 showed a very intriguing dynamical evolution with multiple events of fragmentation
and merging of magnetic structures. Eventually the region exhibited signiﬁcant cancellation of negative magnetic ﬂux
(cf. region marked by green arrows in Figures 6R2(a), R2(c), and R2(e)).

3.3. Build-up and activation of the hot coronal channel

Based on the GOES light curves (Figure 2(a)), we have deﬁned the pre-ﬂare phase from ≈16:30 UT to ≈17:35 UT
(see Table 1). In Figure 7, we show EUV images of the active region during the pre-ﬂare phase by a few representative
AIA 94 ˚A and 304 ˚A images. Initially, a faint hot channel is identiﬁed beneath coronal loops in the 94 ˚A images
(marked by yellow arrow in Figure 7(a)). From the HMI LOS magnetogram contours overplotted on the 94 ˚A image
(Figure 7(b)), it becomes clear that the hot channel lies over the PIL formed within the trailing sunspot group.
Subsequently, the brightening of the hot channel intensiﬁes (marked by yellow arrows in Figures 7(c) and 7(e)) and it
appears distinctly diﬀerent from the surrounding regions. In view of the spatial association of the hot channel and the
overlying low coronal loops showing bright emission during the pre-ﬂare phase, we identify the region shown inside the
box in Figure 7(e) as the active region core and focus on its evolution in Figure 8. The hot channel continues to show

in the photospheric magnetic structures. We mark two sub-regions R1 and R2 in magnetograms that exhibited signiﬁcant
changes. In panels R1(a)–R1(e), we show a few representative snapshots of the sub-region R1 to highlight important changes.
Yellow arrows indicate a light bridge dividing the negative polarity region of the trailing sunspot group, which apparently
underwent rotation in clockwise direction and eventually became thicker. White arrows indicate motion of a small negative
region toward southwest. Blue arrows indicate southward motion of another negative polarity region. In panels R2(a)–R2(e),
we show the evolution of the sub-region R2. The sky blue arrow in panel R2(a) shows a small negative polarity region, which
merged into the bigger negative polarity region (cf. panels R2(a) and R2(b)). Green arrows in panels R2(a), R2(c), and R2(e)
indicate a region where the magnetic ﬂux rapidly evolved and eventually resulted in signiﬁcant cancellation of negative ﬂux.

enhanced emission till the occurrence of pre-ﬂare peak P2 in GOES light curves (at ≈17:26 UT), which is indicated
by yellow arrow in Figure 7(f).

In AIA 304 ˚A images, we observe a ﬁlament as the chromospheric counterpart of the hot channel (marked by white
arrow in Figure 7(g)). Subsequently, we observe two parallel ribbon-like brightenings at ≈16:45 UT (shown by white
arrows in Figure 7(j)), which are co-temporal with the pre-ﬂare peak P1 (Figure 2(a)). Thereafter, the ﬂux rope
undergoes enhanced brightening at ≈17:26 UT (Figure 7(l)). We note this brightening to be simultaneous with the
appearance of pre-ﬂare peak P2 in GOES light curves (Figure 2(a)).

In Figure 8, we show a sequence of AIA 94 ˚A images with co-temporal RHESSI X-ray images (as contours) overplotted
on each panel. The evolution of the active region core during the ﬁrst peak (P1) of pre-ﬂare phase is shown in Figures
8(a)–8(d). During this phase, the X-ray emissions up to 15 keV is observed to come from the region of overlying coronal
loops. We note, the X-ray emissions have spatially extended structure with multiple centroids, being morphologically
directly resembling with the coronal loop system of the core region.

During the second peak (P2) of the pre-ﬂare phase, we observe strong X-ray emission from the hot channel (Figures
8(e)–(h)) with X-ray emissions up to 25 keV. Evolution of the X-ray sources during this period is very striking. Initially
at ≈17:25 UT, we ﬁnd X-ray emitting sources with distinct centroids in the energy bands up to 15 keV (Figure 8(e)).
The X-ray emissions in 5–10 keV energy band show nearly double centroid structure throughout the pre-ﬂare peak P2
(Figures 8(e)–(h)), whereas, the X-ray centroids in 10–15 keV energy band dissolve (Figure 8(e)–(h)). Notably, the
X-ray emitting sources in 15–25 keV energy band show appearance of multiple centroids (Figure 8(g)), which disappear
afterwards (Figure 8(h)).

pre-ﬂare phase, where the X-ray sources are observed to be emitted from the overlying coronal loops. Panels (e)–(h): sequence
of images for second stage (peaked at P2) of the pre-ﬂare phase. In this period X-ray emissions are observed from the low-lying
hot EUV channel below the coronal loops. The X-ray images are reconstructed by the CLEAN algorithm with integration time
of 40 seconds. The contours drawn are at 70%, 80%, and 90% of the peak ﬂux in each image.

In Figure 9, we present spatially integrated, background subtracted RHESSI spectra along with their respective
ﬁts and residuals for a few selected intervals. Panels (a)–(c) of Figure 9 correspond to the spectra of pre-ﬂare phase
intervals. The RHESSI X-ray spectra during the ﬁrst pre-ﬂare phase (peaked at P1, see Figure 2(a)) shows thermal
emission only (Figures 9(a)–(b)). To estimate the characteristics of hot ﬂaring plasma, namely temperature (T) and
emission measure (EM), the best spectral ﬁt results are obtained with ﬁtting in the energy range of 9–13 keV for this
interval. At this stage, the plasma temperature is ≈19 MK and emission measure is ≈3×1046 cm−3. In the second
pre-ﬂare phase, which peaks at P2 (Figure 2(a)), we ﬁnd rise in temperature (≈24 MK) as well as emission measure
(≈7×1046 cm−3; Figure 9(c)), which suggests increase of thermal emission along with volume of heated plasma.
Notably, during this second phase of the pre-ﬂare activity, the X-ray emission rises to ≈35 keV above the background
level. Contrary to the ﬁrst pre-ﬂare phase, the second pre-ﬂare phase shows distinct yet moderate non-thermal emission
above 19 keV with a steep electron spectral index (δ) of ≈8.2. The spectral ﬁt results obtained during the rise and
main phase of the ﬂare are presented in Figures 9(d)–(f), which are discussed at the end of Section 3.4.

during the peak P1 (≈16:45 UT) and panel (c) shows spectral ﬁt during the peak P2 (≈17:26 UT). We note that, thermal
emission is dominant during the peak P1, whereas during the peak P2, we observe appearance of non-thermal component in the
spectral ﬁt. Both temperature and emission measure rises during the peak P2 compared to P1. Temporal evolution of spectral
ﬁt parameters in the main phase of the M6.6 ﬂare is shown in panels (e)–(h).

3.4. Hot channel eruption and further consequences
The main phase of the M6.6 ﬂare is illustrated by a few representative AIA 94 ˚A images in Figure 10. The activated
hot channel (indicated by the yellow arrow in Figure 10(a)) starts to erupt upward, distending the overlying coronal
loop system (indicated by white arrow in Figure 10(a)). At this early stage, the X-ray emission is originated at
energies (cid:47)25 keV and the sources lie in a relatively compact region (Figure 10(a)). With the further upward expansion
of the hot channel, we observe emission from conjugate HXR sources of 25–50 keV energies (green contours), which
appears to be located near the anchored footpoints of the hot channel (Figure 10(b)). Importantly, the continuous
rise of the GOES ﬂux is superimposed with a distinct peak at ≈17:44 UT, which clearly appears in all the high energy
RHESSI X-ray light curves up to 50 keV energies (Figure 3). The hot channel rises gradually with clear and intact
structure visual in direct AIA 94 ˚A images. In Figures 10(c) and (d), we mark the leading front of the hot channel

seconds. The contour levels are set as 70%, 80%, and 90% of the peak ﬂux in each image. Panels (g)–(i) show formation of
post-ﬂare loop arcades. The red arrow in panel (g) shows the post-ﬂare loops in the northern part of the ﬂaring region, which
ultimately converts into dense post-ﬂare loop arcades. Red arrow in panel (h) shows the start of formation of post-ﬂare loops
in the southern part of the ﬂaring region. In panel (i), dense post-ﬂare loop arcades in both northern and southern part of the
ﬂaring region are indicated by red arrows.

which is gradually ﬁlled by chromospheric brightening (cf. panels (e)–(i)). We observe diﬀuse emission from post-ﬂare coronal
loops (shown by black arrows in panels (g)–(i)).

while the co-temporal observation in AIA 1600 ˚A shows conjugate and sheared ﬂare ribbon brightenings, which are shown by

by white arrows. The GOES light curves further suggest that the ﬂare exhibits an extended maximum phase with
dual peak structures at ≈18:00 UT and ≈18:13 UT. The comparison of AIA 94 ˚A with co-temporal multi-channel
RHESSI images clearly reveals two distinct regions of X-ray emission: the high energy HXR sources between 25 and
100 keV appear in pair as conjugate sources while the low energy emission below (cid:47)25 keV comes from the hotter
region occupied with newly formed EUV coronal loops, in the wake of hot channel eruption (Figures 10(d)–(g)). We
also ﬁnd an increase in separation of the HXR footpoint sources as the ﬂare progresses. We note that the strength
of HXR emission to be higher at the southern footpoint of post-ﬂare loop arcades where the HXR emission upto 50
keV was observed (Figure 10(g)), which suggests an asymmetry in the deposition of energy at conjugate footpoint
locations. Soon after the second peak, the ﬂaring region starts to show the formation of dense, bright, gradually rising
post-ﬂare loop arcades in the northern part (shown by red arrow in Figure 10(g)). Gradually the southern part of the
ﬂaring region also exhibits the build-up of post-ﬂare loop arcades (indicated by red arrow in Figure 10(h)). In Figure
10(i), we show well developed, dense post-ﬂare loop arcades in both northern and southern part of the ﬂaring region
by red arrows.

The comparison of evolution of HXR sources with respect to the AIA 304 ˚A images are shown in Figure 11. After
the activation of the ﬁlament, the brightening started to appear in the form of ﬂare ribbons (shown by green arrows
in Figure 11(b)), which gradually move apart while exhibiting spatial expansion as well (cf. Figures 11(a)–(f)). Also,
as expected, the high energy HXR sources of strength ≈25–100 keV show spatial consistency with the ﬂare ribbons.
The region marked by white arrow in Figure 11(e) undergoes gradual increase in the brightness (cf. Figures 11(e)–(i)).
In the later stages, we observe distinct yet diﬀuse emission from post-ﬂare coronal arcades, which is shown by black
arrows in Figures 11(g)–(i).

As a comparison of phenomena occurring simultaneously in diﬀerent heights of solar atmosphere, we have shown the
ﬂaring region in EUV (AIA 131 ˚A) and UV (AIA 1600 ˚A) channels during the ﬁrst peak of the ﬂare (Figure 12). AIA
131 ˚A image clearly shows the erupting hot channel (i.e., MFR) structure (shown by white arrow in Figure 12(a)). We
observe simultaneous conjugate and sheared ﬂare ribbon brightenings at the photospheric level in AIA 1600 ˚A image
(marked by red arrows in Figure 12(b)).

To understand the activation and eruption of the hot channel, we plot a few AIA 94 ˚A running diﬀerence images
(Figure 13). In various panels, we mark the expanding hot channel by yellow arrows. As discussed earlier, the eruption
resulted into a fast halo CME (Figure 5). In Figure 13(g), we plot a time-slice diagram showing evolutionary phases
of the hot channel. For the purpose, we have speciﬁed a narrow slit B1B2, which is indicated in Figure 13(a). The
time-slice diagram is constructed using the running diﬀerence images with a time gap of ≈4 minutes between the
successive images. The plot reveals a slow rise (speed ≈14 km s−1) phase of the hot channel between ≈17:37 UT
and ≈17:49 UT (shown by red dashed line), which is followed by another phase of its fast eruption. A second order
polynomial ﬁt to the height-time measurement taken between ≈17:49 UT and ≈18:00 UT (shown by yellow dashed
line) yields the speed of the erupting hot channel as ≈37 km s−1 with an acceleration of ≈110 m s−2. The speed of the
erupting hot channel reaches to ≈109 km s−1 at ≈18:00 UT. Notably, we observe formation of post-ﬂare loops from
≈17:57 UT at a projected height of ≈4 Mm.

In Figures 9(d)–(h), we show RHESSI spectral ﬁt results during the rise and main phase of the M6.6 ﬂare. We ﬁnd a
steady rise in temperature as well as spectral hardening during the rise phase (Figure 9(d)). In the main phase of the
event (Figures 9(e)–(h)) the spectra continued to become harder with δ ≈3.3 at ≈18:24 UT. The maximum plasma
temperature (T ≈27 MK) was observed around the second peak of the M6.6 ﬂare (see Figure 9(f)).

3.5. Non-linear-force-free-ﬁeld (NLFFF) modeling of active region corona

The coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines (Figures 14(a)–(c)) are extrapolated using the NLFFF model of Wiegelmann (2008)
to model the ﬂux rope and associated coronal ﬁeld lines. The lower boundary of the extrapolation is taken as
photospheric LOS magnetogram. The MFR, low lying coronal loops (LLCLs), and high coronal loops (HCLs) are
shown by arrows in Figure 14(b). Clear MFR is observed to form in between two opposite polarities of the trailing
sunspot group (Figure 14(c)).

In Figures 14(d)–(e), AIA 171 ˚A and AIA 94 ˚A images of pre-ﬂare stage (at ≈17:25 UT) distinctly show the hot
channel (i.e., MFR), low lying coronal loops (LLCLs), and high coronal loops (HCLs). In Figure 14(d), we present 171
˚A image overplotted with photospheric LOS magnetogram with contour levels as ±[400, 800, 1000, 2000] G. The blue
and red contours denote negative and positive polarities, respectively. The rectangular box in Figure 14(d) shows a
region of hot core, which contains the LLCLs and MFR. The enlarged view of rectangular box is shown in Figure 14(e)

respectively) are shown by white arrows in panel (d). The rectangular box indicates a hot core region, whose enlarged view is
shown in AIA 94 ˚A channel in panel (e) overplotted with RHESSI contours in 5–10 keV (red), 10–15 keV (blue), and 15–25 keV
(yellow). The X-ray contours are reconstructed by CLEAN algorithm with integration time of 40 seconds. The contours denote
70%, 80%, and 90% of peak ﬂux in each image. LLCLs are also clearly visible above the hot channel/MFR, which is co-spatial
with X-ray sources.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive multi-wavelength and multi-instrument study of a remarkable M-class
major eruptive ﬂare, which occurred in AR NOAA 12371 on 2015 June 22. The importance of the study lies in
investigating the activities right from the early pre-ﬂare phase till the decay of the ﬂare with an aim of exploring the
pre-ﬂare processes in detail and the link between the pre-ﬂare and main ﬂare. The main observational results of the
study are itemized below:

1. The eruption initiated from a magnetically bipolar region where a hot EUV channel (evidence of MFR) pre-
existed (at least ≈5.5 hrs before the eruptive M6.6 ﬂare) that exhibited early signatures of activation during
the pre-ﬂare activities. The Hα observations reveal the presence of a ﬁlament in association with the coronal
hot channel. Observations of the pre-ﬂare phase clearly reveal activation of the ﬁlament with early eruption
signatures, providing further credence of our interpretation of pre-ﬂare activities.

2. The hot channel is found to be co-spatial with a MFR detected in NLFFF model extrapolation. A very remarkable
ﬁnding of the study lies in the detection of elongated as well as localized HXR sources of energies up to 25 keV
that lie exactly over the extended central part of the hot channel. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time when
an MFR has been detected in direct HXR observations.

3. An important yet realistic coincidence is the continued presence of X-ray sources during the whole pre-ﬂare
phase. In the early pre-ﬂare phase, the X-ray emission came from the core region, which were comprised of hot,
dense bundle of low lying coronal loops, just above the ﬁlament channel. On the other hand, during the late
pre-ﬂare phase, as explained in item 2 above, the X-ray emission extended up to higher energies and the sources
are located in the region where ﬂux rope existed. These distinct pre-ﬂare intensity enhancements, therefore,
suggest build-up and activation of the MFR by magnetic reconnection involving interaction between the core
ﬁeld region and slowly evolving MFR.

4. The analysis of photospheric magnetograms during the extended period (≈42 hours) prior to the pre-ﬂare phase
of the eruptive ﬂare categorically reveals clockwise rotation of mix polarity sunspot group along with remarkable
moving magnetic features.

5. With the onset of the impulsive phase of M6.6 ﬂare, we ﬁnd a sudden transition of the MFR from the state of
slow rise (≈14 km s−1) to fast acceleration (≈110 m s−2 with the speed rises to ≈109 km s−1 within AIA ﬁeld-
of-view), which points toward a feedback relationship between source region CME dynamics and the strength of
the large-scale magnetic reconnection powering the eruptive ﬂare.

6. The classical signatures of large-scale magnetic reconnection are observed during the impulsive phase in terms of
high energy (up to 100 keV) HXR conjugate sources that lie over the (E)UV ﬂare ribbons. The Hα observations
show the remaining structures of the ﬁlament thus conﬁrming the event to be a partial ﬁlament eruption.

The analyses carried out reveal the appearance of EUV hot channels in the corresponding SDO/AIA observations,
well before (≈5.5 hrs) the eruptive ﬂare. This ﬁnding is in agreement with the contemporary understanding that the
presence of MFR is a prerequisite for a CME (Fan 2005; Li & Zhang 2013; Song et al. 2019). The correspondence
between the spatial location of hot channel and MFR in coronal ﬁeld modeling has been reported in several studies
(Liu et al. 2018b; Mitra et al. 2018), which is further conﬁrmed by our analysis. However, the build-up mechanism
of the MFR is still an open question, which requires extensive observational and theoretical research. The present
study is a step in this direction and suggests that the pre-ﬂare activities play an important role in the process of
MFR activation. The pre-ﬂare activity could be related to evolution in the photospheric magnetic structure. However,
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld changes in the active regions occur gradually but eventually lead to the development of
complex magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the corona which can also be seen in the present case. Our observation of
rotation of sunspot group (in clock wise direction) over several hours, which encloses the PIL and, in the later phases,
overlying developing MFR is probably related to the transfer of twist from sub-photospheric level to the coronal ﬁeld
lines. This long-lasting process would store excess magnetic energy into the coronal ﬂux rope. The brightening up
of the core ﬁeld containing the MFR about 1.25 hours prior to the eruptive ﬂare thus suggests the onset of heating,
probably due to the magnetic reconnection, as the ﬂux rope interacts with immediate low-lying arcades. Subsequently,

21

the hot channel undergoes signiﬁcant intensity enhancement and starts to appear in X-ray images up to 25 keV energies.
Coronal pre-ﬂare activity starts with the initiation of intense emission from the MFR and surrounding regions (an
observational fact that has traditionally been observed in SXR as enhanced emission; see e.g., Veronig et al. 2002;
Chifor et al. 2007; Hernandez-Perez et al. 2019; Joshi et al. 2011, 2013).

We would like to highlight that, in our case, the regions of pre-ﬂare activity and main M6.6 ﬂare are co-spatial.
The statistical studies carried out with SXR images from Yohkoh, revealed three categories of pre-ﬂare activities in
terms of source locations: co-spatial, adjacent, and remote (F´arn´ık & Savy 1998; Kim et al. 2008). The co-spatial
and adjacent cases occurring within few minutes before the main ﬂare are supposed to have direct relevance for the
triggering processes related to the main ﬂare (Liu et al. 2009; Joshi et al. 2011; Mitra & Joshi 2019). Notably, EUV
and X-ray images clearly show that the pre-ﬂare brightenings are spatially distributed along the hot channel (i.e.,
MFR) and within the core ﬁeld region. Further, before the pre-ﬂare emission, the region shows photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld changes along the PIL. These observations present consistency with the tether-cutting model of solar eruption
(Moore & Roumeliotis 1992; Moore et al. 2001) where the build-up of MFR is a consequnce of ﬂux changes along the
PIL and, therefore, early reconnection signatures (causing the pre-ﬂare activity) are expected to occur close to PIL
and nearby core regions (Yurchyshyn et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2014; Dhara et al. 2017).

We ﬁnd direct evidence of pre-ﬂare tether-cutting reconnection in HXR imaging observations at lower energies (up
to 25 keV). The HXR emission signiﬁes intense heating of the core region. With the progress of pre-ﬂare activity, the
strength of HXR emission increases and a subtle yet clear non-thermal component starts to appear, which we identify as
second pre-ﬂare enhancement. The comparison of imaging and spectroscopic observations suggests that both thermal
and non-thermal components originated from the EUV hot channel in the late pre-ﬂare phase.
Importantly, the
HXR source at lower energies presents an elongated morphology and the X-ray sources lie exactly over the EUV hot
channel. These observations provide direct support of tether-cutting reconnection. To our knowledge, the observation
of extended HXR sources from a developing MFR during the pre-ﬂare phase is a new observational ﬁnding. As
expected, during this phase the hot channel rises slowly, an important feature of CME precursor (Sterling & Moore
2005; Nagashima et al. 2007; Sterling et al. 2007; Song et al. 2015). In Hα observations, the partial ﬁlament eruption
begins at this time, further supporting the physical link between the pre-ﬂare activity and initiation of solar eruption.
Importantly, the slowly rising MFR transitioned to a phase of eruptive expansion with the onset of impulsive phase of
M6.6 ﬂare. Now, the appearance of ‘classical’ ﬂare signatures, viz., distinct coronal and footpoint HXR sources along
with inner ﬂare ribbons formed at both sides of PIL, provide evidence of large-scale magnetic reconnection, which are
attributed to the reconnection-opening of overlying ﬁeld lines (i.e., progression of reconnection in higher coronal ﬁelds
of the envelope region) stretched by the erupting MFR. The sudden transition in the kinematic evolution of MFR from
the phase of slow to fast rise precisely divides the pre-ﬂare and impulsive phase of the ﬂare, which we attribute to
the feedback relationship between the early CME dynamics and the strength of the large-scale magnetic reconnection
(Temmer et al. 2008; Vrˇsnak 2016; Song et al. 2018; Mitra & Joshi 2019).
