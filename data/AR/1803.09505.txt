ABSTRACT

We study the thermal structure and energetics of the point-like EUV brightenings within a system of fan loops observed in the active
region AR 11520. These brightenings were simultaneously observed on 2012 July 11 by the HIgh-resolution Coronal (Hi-C) imager
and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We identiﬁed 27 brightenings by
automatically determining intensity enhancements in both Hi-C and AIA 193 Å light curves. The energetics of these brightenings
were studied by using the Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM) diagnostics. The DEM weighted temperatures of these transients
are in the range log T (K) = 6.2 − 6.6 with radiative energies ≈1024−25 ergs and densities ≈ a few times 109 cm−3. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the smallest brightenings in EUV ever detected. We used these results to determine the mechanism of energy loss
in these brightenings. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanism of energy loss for all the identiﬁed brightenings is conduction
rather than radiation.

1. Introduction

One of the most important unsolved problems in solar and helio-
spheric physics is that of determining the mechanism by which
the corona is heated. It is clear now that coronal heating and
magnetic ﬁelds are correlated, but the actual mechanism of how
magnetic energy is transferred to coronal thermal energy is not
for a review). Parker
well understood (see Klimchuk 2006,
(1988) suggested a heating mechanism wherein the energy that
is built-up due to highly turbulent convective motions in the pho-
tosphere, in the form of twisting and tangling of magnetic ﬁeld
lines, is transferred to the upper layers and released through mag-
netic reconnection processes. This process is inherently impul-
sive in nature and is often referred to as the nanoﬂare model of
coronal heating. It was envisioned by Parker (1988) that these
impulsive events may have an energy content of ≈1024 ergs, ≈9
orders of magnitude lower than standard solar ﬂares. However,
there have been no direct observation of individual nanoﬂares,
possibly because they occur at scales unresolvable by the cur-
rently available instruments. Thus, their existence has always
been questioned.

Numerous small scale energetic events with length-scales
ranging from a few arcsec to tens of arcsecs and lifetimes rang-
ing from a few minutes to hours, like explosive events (e.g.,
Dere et al. 1989; Gupta & Tripathi 2015; Huang et al. 2017,
and the references therein), EUV blinkers (e.g., Harrison 1997;
Subramanian et al. 2012, and the references therein), spicules
(e.g., Roberts 1945; Tsiropoula et al. 2012, and the references
therein), macrospicules (e.g., Bohlin et al. 1975; Moore et al.

1977; Kayshap et al. 2013, and the references therein) and X-ray
& EUV jets (e.g., Shibata et al. 1992; Chifor et al. 2008; Subra-
manian et al. 2010; Chandra et al. 2015; Mulay et al. 2016, and
the references therein), have been observed in the solar atmo-
sphere. These events are omnipresent in the solar atmosphere.
However, their contribution to coronal heating is still inconclu-
sive.

Spatial resolution plays a crucial role in the interpretation of
observed coronal plasma. So far, the space-borne extreme ultra-
violet (EUV) and X-ray observations have not achieved the res-
olutions, which would allow us to observe the individual strands
that are presumed to make up coronal loops. The High-resolution
Coronal (Hi-C; Cirtain et al. 2013) rocket ﬂight has recorded
the best resolution images of the solar corona. These observa-
tions have provided us with a spectacular trove of data of a group
of active regions (ARs). These observations have unraveled in-
teresting transient features in the moss (Testa et al. 2013) and
inter-moss regions (Winebarger et al. 2013), as well as at the
footpoints of a fan loop system associated with AR 11520 (EUV
bright dots; Régnier et al. 2014). These brightenings were clas-
siﬁed as nanoﬂare-like brightenings by the respective authors.

The study presented in this paper is focussed on the tran-
sients EUV brightenings seen in fan loop systems associated
with AR 11520. These brightenings appear as tiny dot-like in-
tensity enhancements. A sample of 8 such events was studied by
Régnier et al. (2014). These events were characterised in four
diﬀerent categories based on their light curve characteristics, as
single intensity peak events, double intensity peak events, long
duration events, and bursty events with multiple intensity peaks.
They have length scales of ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48) and lifetime of ∼25 s. These
scales are either comparable or much shorter than the resolv-
able limits of the best available EUV full-disk imager, the Atmo-

spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board
the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). These tiny dots are the
smallest EUV brightenings ever observed or reported in the lit-
erature and have energies a few orders of magnitude more than
the nanoﬂares energy budget.

Using a potential ﬁeld extrapolation of line-of-sight magne-
tograms obtained with Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Scherrer et al. 2012) on board SDO, Régnier et al. (2014) found
that these events are predominantly located at the footpoints of
large scale trans-equatorial coronal loops with energy content of
1026 ergs per brightening. Régnier et al. (2014) concluded that
these bright dots are multi-thermal in nature with temperatures
ranging between log T (K) = 5.3 − 6.5 using the EM loci analysis
method (see e.g., Jordan et al. 1987; Tripathi et al. 2010).

Since direct observations of the heating mechanisms respon-
sible for these brightenings are still infeasible, a comprehen-
sive understanding of such small scale brightenings is crucial.
A quantitative analysis of the energetics involved in these tran-
sients is of paramount importance to establish their role in heat-
ing the fan loops and the solar corona in general. Here, we study
the brightenings as a statistical ensemble, i.e., by analysing all
the individual brightenings that occurred near the footpoint of
the trans-equatorial fan loop system during the course of the Hi-
C observations. Our objective is to identify such brightenings in
Hi-C observations and study their energetics by employing Dif-
ferential Emission Measure (DEM) diagnostics. For such diag-
nostics, it is mandatory to have multi-ﬁlter observations. There-
fore, we searched for the same brightening in the AIA 193 Å ob-
servations. The DEMs are then derived using AIA ﬁlters. Even
though the AIA 193 Å channel’s eﬀective area and thermal re-
sponse are similar to that of Hi-C, these events are readily ob-
served in the latter but not in the former. In order to make sure
that the events observed in AIA are the same as those seen in
Hi-C, we perform a detailed analysis to understand the inter-
calibration between Hi-C and AIA including the eﬀects of the
spatial and temporal binning, and the point spread functions.

The paper is structured as follows. In §2, we present the ob-
servations taken using Hi-C and AIA that are analysed in this
work. In §3, we describe how the brightenings are detected in
both Hi-C and AIA 193 Å, and present the inter-calibration of
the instruments including spatial pixelisation and PSF eﬀects,
and temporal variability. In §4, we discuss the results with ref-
erence to the energetics of the events, and ﬁnally we summarise
and conclude in §5.

2. Observations and data reduction

Near simultaneous images of AR 11520 taken on 2012 July 11,
with both Hi-C and AIA instruments, have been used in this
study. Being a sounding rocket mission, Hi-C produced data for
only about 5 minutes. The telescope ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) suf-
fered from a considerable jittering. Due to this, the FOVs of each
Hi-C images were diﬀerent. A common FOV covered by all Hi-
C images is obtained by co-aligning individual Hi-C images with
respect to each other. It is represented by the white outer box in
the left panel of Figure 1, which shows the AIA full disk image
of the Sun recorded using the 193 Å channel. The left panel also
shows the ﬁeld of interest (FOI; inner white box) that encom-
passes the dot like EUV brightenings and the associated coronal
footpoints of the fan loop system studied in this work. This fan
loop system is rooted in the plage along the north-west of the
active region. Here we have used only the data obtained between

18:52:48 and 18:55:30 UT. The right panel of Figure 1 displays
the FOI as observed by Hi-C.

The AIA provides continuous full disk images of the solar
atmosphere in 10 diﬀerent UV/EUV passbands with a pixel size
of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48). In this study, the data obtained over a region correspond-
ing to the Hi-C FOI (inner box of Figure 1, left panel), taken be-
tween 18:45 and 19:00 UT, in six EUV channels (131 Å, 171 Å,
193 Å, 211 Å, 335 Å and 94 Å) are used. All data have been pro-
cessed using the standard reduction procedure available in Solar
SoftWare (SSW). The Hi-C level 1.0 data are corrected with the
proper time stamp and are co-aligned to match with the AIA
data.

3. Data analysis

3.1. Brightening identiﬁcation

For automatically detecting the EUV brightenings in the fan loop
system studied in Régnier et al. (2014) (shown in Figure A.1), we
use an identiﬁcation procedure on the light curves obtained from
individual pixels (Subramanian et al. 2010, 2012). The identiﬁ-
cations are carried out independently for both the AIA and Hi-C
data. For this purpose, pixelwise light curves are obtained for
AIA 193 Å as well as Hi-C. All the light curves, for both AIA
and Hi-C, are boxcar smoothed over a window of three frames
in time in order to minimise false identiﬁcations of background
ﬂuctuations as brightenings. Thus, brightenings are identiﬁed
only when their lifetime exceeds 16.5 s in Hi-C and 36 s in AIA
(note that this diﬀerence has no eﬀect on the detections of the
events in AIA vis-a-vis Hi-C). The background is estimated lo-
cally by excluding the identiﬁed intensity peaks from the respec-
tive light curves and averaging over the rest of the light curves.
In the case of Hi-C, an event is considered to be valid only when
two or more adjacent pixels are detected by the identiﬁcation
procedure, and these pixels are merged into a single event.

The algorithm identiﬁes pixel-wise intensity enhancements
that are above an user deﬁned intensity threshold in the input
light curves. It also computes the start and end times of the
events, and their respective positions in pixel coordinates. An in-
tensity threshold of 1.17× and 1.07× the local background in Hi-
C and AIA, respectively, commensurate with the observed ﬂuc-
tuations in the background. This means that only enhancements
larger than 1σ percentage ﬂuctuations are considered real. Fig-
ure 2 shows the FOI in AIA 193 Å (left) and Hi-C 193 Å (mid-
dle) with all identiﬁed pixels over-plotted with yellow boxes.
The identiﬁed pixels are then spatially grouped together to form
brightenings.

Of all the identiﬁed brightenings in Hi-C and AIA 193 Å ob-
servations, 27 events that fall near the footpoint region of the fan
loop system are considered for further analysis. The right panel
in Figure 2 shows the Hi-C 193 Å image of the FOI, same as in
the middle panel, but marked with the locations of the identiﬁed
27 brightenings. As already emphasised earlier, the prime aim of
this work is to probe the thermal structure and energetics of these
events. We accomplish this by computing DEMs using AIA data
alone. The AIA 193 Å channel’s eﬀective area and thermal re-
sponse are similar to that of Hi-C 193 Å, and thus including the
Hi-C data in DEM analysis is not required. Using the Hi-C ﬁl-
ter in the DEM would double the weight on the 193 Å channel
in the analysis. However, Hi-C information is crucial in iden-
tifying these brightenings in the ﬁrst place. Since these bright-
enings are not readily discernible visually as individual events

in AIA 193 Å observations, most of these events would be dis-
carded as not real without the input from the Hi-C observations.
Light curves of these 27 brightenings are then derived by
summing 2×2 pixels in AIA and 6×6 pixels in Hi-C. In Figure 3,
we show illustrative examples of two brightening events, Br7 and
Br26, that compare the Hi-C and AIA 193 Å light curves. De-
spite the similarity in Hi-C and AIA 193 Å ﬁlter responses, the
respective light curves show signiﬁcant disparities and we have
to make sure that the events observed in AIA are the same as
those seen in Hi-C. Therefore, we next consider diﬀerent causes
that account for these diﬀerences and develop a correction that
allows us to analyse the events in tandem.

3.2. Comparison of Hi-C and AIA 193 Å brightenings

Even though both Hi-C and AIA 193 Å detectors show increased
emission over roughly the same time period, there are notable

diﬀerences between the two light curves. First, the ratio of the
peak intensity to the background is always larger in the Hi-C
light curves compared to that in AIA light curves. For the two
sample events shown here, the ratios are respectively ≈2.8 and
1.5 in Hi-C, versus 1.3 and 1.1 in AIA. It is also evident that the
AIA light curves have a background almost twice as high as that
in Hi-C. Another important diﬀerence is that the brightenings
show broader peaks in AIA than in Hi-C. These characteristics
are not unique for these two brightenings, but are observed in all
the analysed events (Appendix: Figure C.1 & C.2).

The question that naturally arises is whether these diﬀer-
ences are introduced by the inherent features of the instru-
mentations, like the diﬀerence in the achieved spatial/temporal-
resolution and the PSF (point spread function). Therefore, in or-
der to remove any systematic biases in the direct comparison
of Hi-C and AIA intensities for these brightenings, it is critical
to account for the observed diﬀerences between Hi-C and AIA

Article number, page 3 of 17

A&A proofs: manuscript no. hic_ﬁnal_2C_ﬁnal

light curves, in the background level and the width, along with
the peak to background ratio.

We note that the light curves are compared after normalis-
ing by their respective exposure times. Furthermore, only events
that last at least 3 individual exposure frames are detectable.
Thus, neither temporal resolution nor exposure time diﬀerences
are likely to explain the observed diﬀerences between the light
curves. It is also unlikely to be due to diﬀerences in pixel scales,
since the 6×6 pixel binned Hi-C light curves of these brighten-
ings are similar to the light curves obtained from the original
Hi-C images. Below we consider the eﬀect of the diﬀerent PSFs
on the light curves.

3.3. Effect of AIA PSF

An astronomical image is the convolution of the true source with
the PSF of the telescope, with added statistical noise. Therefore,
the comparison of images obtained using diﬀerent PSFs is non-
trivial. Thus, in order to understand the eﬀect of PSFs on the ob-
served images, we convolved the Hi-C images with the PSF of
AIA 193 Å. Here we have assumed that the Hi-C instrument has
a δ-function PSF, i.e., the Hi-C images are high-ﬁdelity repre-
sentations of the real Sun. This is a reasonable assumption since
the Hi-C PSF is signiﬁcantly sharper than that of AIA. For this
analysis, we used a model PSF of AIA instrument obtained using
the aia_calc_psf.pro routine (Boerner et al. 2012).

We then tested diﬀerent binning schemes and found that a
6×6 pixel binning of the Hi-C convolved images matches the
spatial scale of the AIA images (see Appendix A). We, hence-
forward, refer to these AIA-pixel-compatible Hi-C images as Hi-
C convolved-and-binned (CB) images. A comparison of the light
curves of the brightenings derived from the original Hi-C images
and the Hi-C CB images clearly shows that convolution (with
AIA PSF) and binning improves drastically the resemblance of
Hi-C light curves to that of AIA (compare solid green line [HiC],
black curve [HiC CB], and dashed blue curve [AIA] in Figure 3;
see also Appendix C). It is evident that the broader PSF of the
AIA aﬀects the observed evolution of the brightenings, by broad-
ening the width of the peak and reducing the peak-to-background
contrast.

Note however that even though the Hi-C convolved-and-
binned light curves (solid black line) look similar in shape to the
corresponding AIA (dashed blue line) light curves, the curves
remain oﬀset. Thus, the diﬀerences between the Hi-C and AIA
PSFs alone is insuﬃcient to account for all the observed diﬀer-
ences between the respective light curves.

3.4. Hi-C and AIA 193 Å intensity co-relation

Though AIA 193 Å and Hi-C have similar eﬀective areas, the
registered intensities show signiﬁcant diﬀerences. Therefore, a
quantitative relation between the Hi-C and AIA 193 Å baseline
trends must be established. In order to check the relative calibra-
tion, we computed the ratio of the intensities in each matched
pixel between AIA 193 Å and corresponding Hi-C CB nearest
in time. The average of the ratios, from the sample over the pix-
els in the FOI, is plotted as a function of time in Figure 4. A
systematic decrease of ≈8% is clearly visible in the data. The

standard error1 associated with these measurements is estimated
to be 0.0028, too small to be displayed in the Figure 4. The er-
ror is even negligible when compared to the changes observed
over time. In general, the AIA intensities are 69 − 83% higher
than that of Hi-C, with an average of 73%, which we attribute to
probable diﬀerences in the mirrors and slightly diﬀerent thermal
responses of the two ﬁlters.

As mentioned above, the averaged ratio shows a systematic
decrease of ≈8% in the relative intensities over the course of
the Hi-C observations. However, no prominent solar activity oc-
curred in the FOI which could account for the observed trend.
Intriguingly, this trend has never been reported earlier in other
published works on the Hi-C observations. In order to ensure
that this is not an artefact of region selection, or due to inoppor-

where σ is the standard deviation of the original distribution and N is
the sample size. It determines how precisely the mean of the sample
estimates the population mean.

is clearly visible in the data.

tune plasma ﬂow over the FOI, we investigated this phenomenon
in further detail.

We ﬁrst subdivide the Hi-C FOI into 3×3 equal-area cells
and compute the average of the pixel-wise intensity ratios sep-
arately in each cell as above (see Figure 5; top). Strikingly, the
ratios of the spatially averaged intensities in all the cells show
a decreasing trend. We also carry out the same analysis for the
entire Hi-C FOV (outer box of Figure 1), by sub-dividing it into
3×3 equal-area cells and again computing the temporal trend of
the averaged pixel-wise ratios of the AIA and Hi-C [CB] inten-
sities. Figure 5 (bottom) shows the corresponding ratios, and it
is evident that the decreasing trend in the ratios persists even in
this case. The thick black line in the bottom panel is the average
over the entire Hi-C FOV, %bf and it shows the same trend as
the ratio of the light curves averaged over all pixels in our FOI
(Figure 4).

The observed behaviour of the spatially averaged ratios of
AIA and Hi-C intensities is fully explained by the intensity vari-
ations within the Hi-C alone. Figure 6 shows the averaged AIA
and Hi-C intensity curves from the FOI, between 18:50:00–
18:58:00 UT in the case of AIA (dot-dashed line) and between
18:52:48–18:55:30 UT in the case of Hi-C (solid line), nor-
malised to the respective maximum values within this time pe-
riod. Hi-C shows a nearly monotonic rise by ≈8% over the oper-
ational time-scale, while the AIA registers none and only shows
a ﬂuctuation of ∼1%. In fact, the AIA intensities remain stable
beyond the observational duration of the Hi-C ﬂight. This sug-
gests either a large scale, hitherto undetected, ﬂow in the solar
corona that preferentially aﬀects the Hi-C ﬁlter, or a variation in
the calibration characteristics of Hi-C during its ﬂight. We prefer
the latter as being a simpler explanation.

Therefore, we attribute this rise in the Hi-C averaged in-
tensity to environmental or instrumental drifts during the Hi-C
ﬂight. Regardless of origin, this diﬀerence in trends must be cor-
rected for in order to compare the intensity ﬂuctuations between
Hi-C and AIA.

Fig. 5. Similar to Figure 4, for ratios of AIA and Hi-C[CB] intensities
averaged over several sub-regions of the Hi-C ﬁeld of view. The ﬁeld
of interest (FOI; top) and the ﬁeld of view (FOV; bottom) are split into
3×3 equal-area square grids and the pixel-wise ratios of the light curve
intensities are averaged over each cell of the grid are shown. Each curve
is marked with a colour and symbol corresponding to the cell in the
grid as shown in the grid key at top right. In all cases the 1σ standard
errors are marked with thin vertical lines. The black dashed line in the
bottom plot shows the average of the ratios over the full Hi-C FOV.
For comparison, the ratio averaged over the entire FOI from Figure 4 is
shown in the top plot as the gray shaded region.

We correct for this apparent trend in the Hi-C sensitivity with
a time-dependent correction factor obtained from a spline in-
terpolation of the normalised average ratio curve (Figure 4) at
the Hi-C observation times. A new set of Hi-C light curves are
obtained by multiplying the Hi-C CB light curves by this in-
terpolated ratio array. These convolved-binned-corrected (CBC)
curves are shown in Figure 7 (red solid lines), along with the
original Hi-C light curve (green line marked with ‘+’ symbols),
and the AIA 193 Å light curve (dotted blue line with asterisks),
as in Figure 3. The horizontal black dotted line represents the
estimated background in AIA. For this, we interpolated the light
curves in seconds. The start and end times are deﬁned as the
points in the light curve, respectively on either side of the peak
and closest in time with respect to the peak, where the diﬀer-
ence in intensity between the light curve and the background is
positive and minimum. In two cases, there are no possible inter-
sections between the light curve and the estimated background

during the rise phase of the events (Br19 and Br22), and for these
we deﬁne the start time visually.

We calculate a χ2-like measure of similarity between the Hi-
C CBC curves and the AIA 193 Å light curves in order to under-
stand how well they match. We compute

where DN(.) are the intensities in units of [DN], with assumed

for each case.

average im-
proves from factors of > 103 to factors of a few after the CBC
corrections. The visual comparisons also conﬁrm that the Hi-
C CBC light curves provide a good match for the AIA 193 Å
light curves. This combination of pixel-binning, AIA 193 Å PSF
convolution, and correction of the intensity for oﬀset and drift,
explains the diﬀerences between the light curves for most of the
brightenings.

As pointed out above, these brightenings are less discernible
– though detectable – in AIA 193 Å due to the combined eﬀect
of the lower AIA resolution and the larger width of the PSF. Hi-
C detects these transient brightenings more eﬃciently by dint of
having a smaller spatial spread of the signal and a corresponding
lower background.

3.5. AIA event intensities

For each of the brightening events, their intensities are computed
in each AIA passband over the lifetime of the event as deter-
mined in the AIA 193 Å ﬁlter, and the light curves are interpo-
lated to a uniform grid. For the AIA 193 Å light curve, a back-
ground level is determined from intensities outside the detectable
events, and subtracted from the corresponding event light curve.
For other ﬁlters, where the contrast between the events and the
background vary widely, the minima in the light curves over the
event duration are used to set the background. The subtracted
light curves are integrated over the event lifetimes, denoting

solely the intensities measured in each AIA passband for that
event.

The average intensities over the lifetime of the events are
given in Table 2. These intensities are used to compute the
emission measure distribution (see Section 4.1 below) and in-
fer average temperatures and plasma densities that character-
ize the brightenings. We compute a nominal statistical error for
each ﬁlter by estimating the signal over the event lifetime as
intensity × lifetime. We adopt the larger of this statistical
≈
error or 10% of the average intensity as the deﬁning uncertainty
on the measured ﬂuxes. The adopted values are given Table 2.

4. Results and discussion

Having identiﬁed 27 brightenings based on Hi-C and AIA, we
now turn to study the thermal structure and energetics of these
events. An interesting characteristic of our sample of 27 events is
that the light curves of all the events are found to have complex
structure. They either have multiple peaks, or appear partially
as incomplete observations at the beginning or end of the Hi-C
observation run. We do not ﬁnd any event with only one peak,
that is, with a monotonic rise followed by a monotonic fall in the
Hi-C intensity over their lifetime.

Table 1 lists the properties of the events derived from
AIA 193 Å light curves, along with the number of prominent
peaks observed in Hi-C light curves. Of the events listed as hav-
ing one peak, some (Br7, Br9, and Br26) have one prominent
peak which could be easily analysed, and have multiple less en-
ergetic burstiness during either the rise or decay phases. In some
other cases (Br19, Br22, Br23, Br24, and Br25), the events are
only partially registered in Hi-C, and their characteristics outside
of this epoch cannot be inferred.

4.1. Thermal structure

Each ﬁlter has a diﬀerent response R(T ) to plasma at a temper-
ature T , determined by the emissivities ε(T, λ) of the lines over
the wavelength range λ that the ﬁlter transmits, the transmission
sensitivity of the ﬁlter, and the sensitivities of the telescope and
detector over the corresponding wavelength range, the so-called
eﬀective area, Aeﬀ(λ). Thus, R(T ) = (cid:82)
ε(T, λ) Aeﬀ(λ) dλ, with
Λ(T ) = (cid:82)
ε(T, λ) dλ, integrated over the domain of Aeﬀ(λ), be-
ing the intrinsic emitted power in the ﬁlter passband. We used
atomic emissivities from Chianti (v7), combined with solar
coronal abundances from Schmelz et al. (2012), and ﬁlter cal-
ibration available in SSW to compute R(T ) for all the AIA ﬁlters.

where ne is the electron density and h is the column depth of the
plasma in the corona.

In general, the signal from a column of plasma is multi-
thermal since it views diﬀerent layers of the corona. However,
coronal plasma from isolated structures can be approximated
well as isothermal, i.e., DEM(T ) = EM · δ(T − T0), where δ(·)
represents the Dirac δ-function. When such an approximation is
valid, the emission measure (EM) loci predicted for the various
ﬁlters at diﬀerent isothermal temperatures T0 will intersect in
EM − T space (see e.g., Jordan & Wilson 1971; Tripathi et al.
2010). Conversely, the lack of an obvious intersection point for
the EM loci indicates that the plasma being observed is multi-
thermal, and a detailed DEM analysis is necessary to explain the
observed intensities.

We show EM loci curves of the sample brightenings, Br7
and Br26, in Figure 8 (left panels; the EM loci curves of the rest
of the brightenings are given in C in Figures C.1-C.4). The pre-
dicted EM loci curves do not show indications of iso-thermality,
and we therefore employed a more sophisticated analysis to
model the thermal structure of the plasma in each brightening.

We constructed DEMs for each of these brightenings by ap-
plying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based DEM
reconstruction algorithm of Kashyap & Drake (1998) on the
background-subtracted average intensities in each AIA ﬁlter. We
note that the Hi-C data are excluded from this analysis as they
are already mirrored in the AIA 193 Å ﬁlter data.

The MCMC iterations produce a set of DEM solutions, one
per iteration, each drawn from the posterior probability distri-
bution of the DEM(T ). The solutions are locally smoothed to
ensure that there are suﬃcient constraints on the number of pa-
rameters that the degrees of freedom is >2, suﬃcient to prevent
overﬁtting, and to usefully characterise a gross shape. The solu-
tions are generated as a combination of isothermal plasma with
diﬀerent EM at over the temperature range log T (K) = 5.5 − 7.
Even though the thermal response of the AIA ﬁlters is deﬁned
over a broad temperature range (log T (K) = 4 − 8), the magni-
tudes of the response curves are large and relevant over a much
shorter range. The algorithm also provides a measure of the sen-
sitivity of the solutions to the temperature range, as individual
temperatures are drawn in each iteration from a sampling distri-
bution that encodes both the overall responses of the AIA ﬁlters
as well as rapid changes in the response; the former ensures cov-
erage where the thermal response is high, and the latter focuses
on regions which provide the most leverage to determining the
thermal structure. The number of draws at each temperature then
indicates whether that temperature is well covered or not.

In all our analyses, we ﬁnd that limiting the temperature
range to log T (K) = 5.5 − 7 ensures coverage at the 95% level.
In all calculations that require integration over temperature, we
use this temperature range. The AIA ﬁlters are not sensitive to
temperatures outside this range and the DEM solutions are ef-
fectively unconstrained (the so-called “toothpaste-tube eﬀect”, a
term popularised by L. Golub and J. Schmelz), which causes
highly non-linear aliasing eﬀects due to the ﬁnite range over
which the thermal responses are useful. We ran the code to pro-
duce 5000 iterations after burn-in and thinning by a factor of 10,
and checked the traces of the ﬁt statistic to ensure that the chain
had converged in each case.

Illustrative solutions are shown in Figure 8 (second panels
from left) for Br7 and Br26 (see Appendix C for solutions for all
the other brightenings; see third panels from left in Figure C.1-
C.4). The ﬁgures show the range of possible solutions and in-
dicate both point-wise uncertainties (the whisker plots, where
the blue horizontal bars show the median solution at the given
temperature, the green boxes show the range of 50% of the so-
lutions at that temperature, and the green vertical line shows the
full range of the solutions), as well as the extent of the cross-
temperature correlations in the solutions (the grey lines show all
the DEM curves that are the modal solution at some tempera-
ture). The dashed red line is the nominal best-ﬁt solution, i.e.,
the solution with the lowest χ2. Note that the best-ﬁt solution is
not required to, and often does not, go through the part of the dis-
tributions with the highest probabilities. This is because there is
considerable cross-talk in the solutions between the values at dif-
ferent temperatures, leading to diﬀerent solutions crossing many
times.

Once the DEM solutions have been calculated, we can com-
pute which temperatures contribute to the ﬂux observed in the
AIA 193 Å ﬁlter, and by proxy, to the Hi-C detected brighten-
ings. We fold the DEM solutions with the ﬁlter response and plot
the relative intensity of the ﬂux at each temperature in Figure 8
for Br7 and Br26 (right panels; the right panels in Figure C.1-
C.4 in Appendix C show the ﬂux-temperature plot for the other
brightenings). Notice that temperatures that contribute most to
the ﬂux are generally at T ≈ 1 − 2 MK, with occasional compo-
nents appearing at T ≈ 3 MK.

From the DEM solutions, we also estimate the total emis-
sion measure, EM, and the radiated ﬂux Fx, computed using

where Λtotal(T ), the radiative loss function over the EUV pass-
band, is calculated using the procedure rad_loss.pro in the
Chianti package. The estimated values of these quantities are
listed in Table 3. The DEM-weighted average log T are in the
range log T (K) = 6.2 − 6.6, meaning most of the emission de-
tected in AIA ﬁlters is emitted around this temperature range.
The total energy emitted is then the product of the average ﬂux,
the lifetime of the event in AIA 193 Å, and the area covered by
the event which is 2×2 pixels,

4.2. Decay time scales and density estimates

As with any dynamic solar activity, the EUV brightenings show
a rise phase, associated with increase in intensity, followed by a
decay phase until they disappear into the background. The cool-
ing phase of the event can provide crucial information about the
associated electron density.

where the summation is carried out if the brightening has K>1
peaks which begin at times t(i)
0 , Ni are the normalizations of each
of the exponential decay components, and B(t) represents a ﬁxed
background whose shape is determined from the AIA-to-HiC
conversion described in Section 3.2, scaled to match the Hi-C
light curve outside the domain of the brightenings. The ﬁt is car-
ried out over time ranges that show the event to be decaying.
The resulting decay timescales are shown in the third column of
Table 4.

In the corona, both the thermal conduction and radiation are
eﬀective ways of losing energy gained through any heating pro-
cess. The relative eﬃciencies of the two mechanisms is essen-
tially determined by the timescales of the processes, which are
dependent on both the temperature and the density. Conduction
is expected to be the dominant cooling process in instances of
high temperatures and high densities, and during the early phase
of ﬂares, while radiative cooling is the primary loss mechanism
at low densities and during post-ﬂare cooling phases (see e.g.,
Cargill et al. 1995; Raftery et al. 2009).

In general, the observed decay timescale can be written as

where τR is the decay timescale for energy loss from optically
thin thermal radiation,
τR = 3 kB T
neΛ(T )

(8)

,

with ne the electron density, Λ(T ) the radiative loss rate at
the temperature (T) calculated from Chianti, and τC is the
decay timescale for energy loss due to conduction (see, e.g.,
(Winebarger et al. 2003; Wargelin et al. 2008)),
τC = 4 × 10−10neL2

(9)

with L the length scale of the emitting plasma.

We can further simplify Equation 9 by noting that for small,
low-lying, apparently homogeneous events such as those con-
sidered here, the length scale can be approximated as L ∼ EM

(viz. Equation 3); the EM is the integrated DEM as reported in

Uncertainties are estimated through Monte Carlo bootstrap, with
the variance in the DEM-weighted temperature, the estimated
EM, and the measured decay timescale propagated through to
the density. These densities are ∼ 109−10 cm−3, which is typi-
cal of solar active region densities (see e.g., Tripathi et al. 2008,
2009; Young et al. 2009).

4.3. Conduction dominated loss

The relative importance of conductive and radiative loss can be
established by comparing the corresponding decay timescales
for the estimated plasma density. The process with the shorter
timescale proceeds faster and thus controls the dynamics. To es-

timate it, we introduce and compute a Conductive Loss Impor-
tance Factor (CLIF),

CLIF = log

τR
τC

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ne

.

(12)

The decay timescales that correspond to the computed den-
sities are signiﬁcantly larger for radiative losses than for conduc-
tive losses (τR (cid:29) τC; see Table 4). Thus, we conclude that the
dynamics of these brightening events are dominated by conduc-
tive loss. To our knowledge, these are the ﬁrst non-ﬂare events
found to be driven by conductive losses in the lower corona.

We note that for typical ﬁeld strengths of 50 G, the magnetic
energy available over the estimated volumes of these brighten-
ings is ≈ 1026 ergs, substantially greater than the actual deposited
energies (cid:38) 1024−25 ergs (see Table 3), This suggests that a large
fraction of the deposited energy is not visible in the radiated
photons, but is instead conducted away elsewhere, contributing
eventually to the thermal content of the corona. The magnitude
of these events is similar to that from nano-ﬂare like events, but
they do not show the nominal signature of a high-temperature
component in the DEM. However, we base our calculations of
the DEM in the crucial assumption that the plasma has achieved
local equilibrium (both in the neighbourhood of the event and
over durations shorter than the lifetimes of the events); if this as-
sumption becomes invalid because of the eﬀects of conduction
processes, then a high-temperature component could be present
but undetected.

Conduction as a cooling mechanism has been known to be
important during the early stages of ﬂares (e.g., Cargill et al.
1995; Raftery et al. 2009) and microﬂares (Gupta et al. 2018).
Our estimates of CLIF are consistent with the τR
expected from
τC
Cargill et al. (1995).

Note that the conductive decay timescale τC decreases as the
plasma temperature increases. Thus, if our DEM analysis un-
derestimates the high-temperature plasma component, the con-
ductive loss will be more prominent. We assume in our analysis
that the brightening events are not subject to continuous heat-
ing. If such a process is operating, the estimated τobs is an upper
bound on the unforced decay timescale, which also acts to in-
crease CLIF. Thus, we ﬁnd our conclusion that the brightenings
are conduction dominated to be robust. Indeed, even to bring
parity between τR and τC requires that the radiative power loss
is underestimated by nearly two orders of magnitude, well be-
yond the expected range of atomic data uncertainties; or that the
emission measure EM be increased while the plasma density ne
is decreased, which is infeasible since that requires the brighten-
ings to be 4× larger in size than observed.

5. Summary and conclusions

We have studied the energetics of a larger sample (27) of small
scale dot-like brightenings recorded by the Hi-C instrument by
employing DEM diagnostics. These brightenings were predom-
inantly located near the footpoints of a fan-loop system. Since
DEM diagnostics requires intensities measured in diﬀerent lines
or ﬁlters, we have made use of the co-spatial and co-temporal ob-
servations recorded by AIA. For this purpose, inter-calibration of
the images taken using Hi-C and AIA 193Å were performed and
summarised below.

Since our analysis requires pixel to pixel matching of Hi-C
and AIA images, we have binned the Hi-C data by diﬀerent fac-
tors and found that a 6x6 binning mimics the AIA scaling. Next,

Subramanian et al.: Hi-C EUV Heating

Fig. 8. Analyzing the thermal structure of brightenings. EM loci curves (left column), DEM distributions (middle column) and an estimate of ﬂux
contribution of the DEM at diﬀerent temperatures (right) are shown for the brightenings Br7 (top row) and Br26 (bottom row). In the DEM plots
(middle column), the blue horizontal segments mark the modes of the distribution of DEMs at each temperature bin, the green boxes indicate 50%
coverage, and the dashed red line is the nominal best-ﬁt (see text).

an automated identiﬁcation procedure was used to identify all
the EUV intensity enhancements in the Hi-C FOV (Figure 2).
Out of all the identiﬁed events, 27 dot-like brightenings that fall
near the fan loop footpoint region were chosen for further de-
tailed analysis. The visual inspection of AIA 193 Å images for
these dot-like Hi-C brightenings reveal that these events were
barely distinguishable. Traces can be observed for most of these
events if we speciﬁcally look for each of them individually in
AIA observations in comparison with Hi-C. However, all the 27
events are clearly identiﬁed when the automated identiﬁcation
procedure is applied over the corresponding AIA 193 Å images.
We compared the AIA and Hi-C light curves of all the events
and found that the Hi-C light curves show narrow peaks with
a higher peak to background intensity ratio. Hi-C background
intensity was always approximately half the AIA background
intensity. The multiple peaks in Hi-C light curves revealed the
bursty nature of energy deposition in the solar corona, which was
not captured by AIA observations, though the AIA observations
do capture the overall evolution of the event. A combination of
PSF and the observed high background intensities possibly re-
duces the eﬃciency of AIA in distinguishing these small scale
intensity enhancement events.

The achieved spatial/temporal resolution and the PSF of Hi-
C and AIA 193 Å images diﬀer substantially. We accounted for
the eﬀect of these diﬀerences when comparing the light curves.
First, the Hi-C images were convolved with the AIA PSF and
re-binned to match their scale, and the intensities were then cor-
rected to account for an observed drift in the ratio of spatially av-
erage intensities over the common ﬁeld of view. This drift was at-
tributable to the Hi-C, and the convolved, binned, and intensity-
corrected Hi-C light curves were found to match well with AIA
light curves for all the events.

We then computed Diﬀerential Emission Measures (DEMs)
for AIA ﬁlter intensities using an MCMC-based algorithm
for each of the brightenings. We found that the the average

log T (K) ≈ 6.2 − 6.6, based on averaging the DEM over a tem-
perature range of 0.3 − 10 MK. The estimated plasma densities
in these events were found to be a few times 109 cm−3, similar
to the coronal density range.

The radiative ﬂuxes emitted by these events were estimated
to be ≈ 106 ergs s−1 cm−2 and the total radiative energy associ-
ated with these events were ≈ 1024 − 1025 ergs. Régnier et al.
(2014) estimated the amount of magnetic energy associated with
these events to be 1026 ergs and suggested that magnetic energy
budget can be higher than the radiated energy, which is consis-
tent with our estimate.

We found that the dominant cooling mechanism is conduc-
tive loss, suggesting that only a small fraction of the energy
deposited into the plasma becomes visible as radiation. This is
consistent with the total magnetic energy available in this envi-
ronment. Brightenings such as these could form an energetically
important channel for the conversion and deposition of magnetic
energy into the coronal plasma.

In summary, we have identiﬁed apparent low lying brighten-
ings, which are dominated by conduction processes. Such events
are important as the large amount of energy involved in these
events could be contributing to coronal heating, which has not
been taken into account so far. Hence, these events need fur-
ther investigation both theoretically and observationally: their
dynamical evolution must be modelled in detail through hy-
drodynamic simulations; and possible signatures of high-energy
non-thermal processes should be veriﬁed and substantiated with
high-resolution hard X-ray imagers.

Fig. A.1. To decide the appropriate Hi-C pixel size, we compare zoomed
in Hi-C FOI images (left column) at diﬀerent binning factors (top row:
no binning; ﬁrst row: 2×2; second row: 4×4; last row: 6×6) against cor-
respondingly sized AIA images (right column). Recognisable features
are marked with rectangular boxes or arrows. The 6×6 binning provides
the best match between the Hi-C and AIA.

The small-scale Hi-C EUV brightenings have a size compa-
rable to the resolution limit of the AIA 193 Å. Since our work
relies on identifying and matching the Hi-C events to the AIA
data, an accurate pixel-wise cross-correlation is crucial to our
study. For this purpose, postage-stamp FOIs (inner box in Fig-
ure 1) that cover the fan loop system of interest were cut-out
from both Hi-C images (convolved with AIA PSF) and AIA data
(Figure A.1). The Hi-C cut-out images were binned over diﬀer-
ent pixel groups as part of trial-and-error test, to match with the
AIA 193 Å images, which have a spatial resolution of 1.2(cid:48)(cid:48). The
images were binned over 3×3, 4×4 and 6×6 pixel2 (the second,
third, and fourth rows of images in Figure A.1). The binned im-
ages were individually compared with the corresponding AIA
images obtained at the same times. The location of the Hi-C FOI
is marked with an arrow in the AIA image in the no-binning
case (top right panel of Figure A.1), and recognisable features
at each binning level are marked with boxes. We limit our com-

A cubic equation has three roots, but only one that is certain
to be real, and we report this number. In all cases, we ﬁnd that
neither of the other solutions are near the real line. Note that this
solution is strictly applicable only to isothermal plasma.

However, the DEM-weighted average T (see Table 3) has er-
ror bars of size ≈ 10%, and we thus expect that the systematic
error made in integrating over the temperature range is ignor-
able. We also provide a measure of the stability of ne by prop-
agating the errors in log T , EM, and τobs. We use Monte Carlo
simulations to generate 1000 Gaussian random deviates for each
quantity and recompute ne; the resulting standard deviations are
given as error bars in Table 4. We ﬁnd post hoc that their eﬀect
on the density estimate is small.
