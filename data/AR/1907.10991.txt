noise, state that feedback does not increase capacity, contrary to the main results of the characterizations

of feedback capacity derived in [1, Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 6.1], for stationary or asymptotically

stationary processes. We show that our disagreement with [1] is mainly attributed to the identiﬁcation of

necessary and/or sufﬁcient conditions, to ensure the asymptotic average power and entropy rates exist,

expressed in terms of the known detectability and stabilizability conditions of convergence of generalized

difference Riccati equations (DREs) to analogous generalized algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), of

Gaussian estimation problems, which are not accounted for in [1, Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 6.1].

I. INTRODUCTION, MOTIVATION, AND MAIN RESULTS OF THE PAPER

The feedback capacity of additive Gaussian noise (AGN) channels driven by nonstationary, and stationary

limited memory Gaussian noise, is addressed, since the early 1970’s, in an anthology of papers, under

various assumptions [1]–[8]. Two of the fundamental problems are related to

(Q1): characterizations and computations of feedback capacity of noiseless feedback codes, when the

initial state S0 = s0 of the noise is known or not known to the encoder and the decoder, and

(Q2): bound on feedback capacity, based on linear feedback coding schemes of communicating
R, and coding schemes of communicating digital
, when the initial state S0 = s0 of the noise is known

This paper is mainly concerned with question (Q1), for AGN channels driven by stable and unstable

noise, when channel input strategies are time-invariant (not necessarily stationary). The ﬁrst objective

is to identify necessary and/or sufﬁcient conditions for optimal channel input strategies to ensure the

limiting average power and the information rates exist, for both stable or unstable channel noise, and

then to determine if additional conditions are needed for these limits to be independent of the initial

states of the noise. Such conditions are identiﬁed. For stable (resp. unstable) noise these conditions also

imply the input and output processes (resp. the input process and innovations process of the output) are

asymptotically stationary, and the limiting average power and the entropy rates do not depend on the

initial states of the channel or their initial distributions. The second main objective is the calculation of

closed form capacity formulas for stable and unstable autoregressive unit memory noise. Such formulas

are derived. They illustrate multiple regimes of capacity, and that feedback does not increase capacity,

when the noise is stable (also for unstable noise for certain values of power κ).

From the main results of this paper follows that several of the answers related to questions (Q1) and

(Q2), given in [1], that treats stable, stationary or asymptotically stationary noises, are incorrect due

to oversights related to convergence of asymptotic average power and entropy rates. In particular, the

oversights affect the validity of feedback capacity described in time-domain [1, Theorem 6.1], by a time-

invariant optimization problem, with zero variance of the innovations of the channel input process; when

August 16, 2021

DRAFT

3

conditions for convergence are imposed, then the value of feedback capacity stated in [1, Theorem 6.1] is

necessarily zero (otherwise the per unit time asymptotic limits of the information theoretic characterization

of feedback capacity does not exists). Some of the technical oversights in [1] are also repeated in [9]–

[12]. These are discussed at various parts of this paper. For the reader’s convenience these are clariﬁed

in Section IV.

To enlarge the scope of the current paper compared to previous literature [1], [8]–[12] that treat feedback

capacity for stable noises, we analyze both the feedback and non-feedback capacity, for stable and

unstable noises (using a uniﬁed approach), although most of our emphasis is on feedback capacity. To

avoid extensive notation, this paper is focused on AGN channels, driven by a correlated Gaussian noise,

of the simplest form, the autoregressive unit memory, stable and unstable noise. However, the method of

this paper apply to more general limited memory noise models [1], [8] (under appropriate assumptions).

A. The Main Problems of Capacity of AGN Channels with Memory

In this section we introduce the precise mathematical formulation, and the underlying assumptions based

on which we derive the results of the paper. We consider the following time-varying AGN channel.

Corollary 7.1], [1, Theorem 3.2] and [9]–[12]. However, as it will be apparent in this paper, conditions

for existence of the limiting average power and entropy rates are not correctly identiﬁed in [1], [8]–[12],

and this oversight led to incorrect characterizations of feedback capacity by a time-invariant optimization

problem (i.e., [1, Theorem 6.1]).

This brings us to the next deﬁnition of capacity, where conditions for existence of the limits of average

power and entropy rates are characterized, and they part of our problem formulation.

Feedback Capacity of Time-Invariant Channel Input Strategies. We consider (I.10), (I.11) with the per

unit time limit and supremum operations interchanged, and time-invariant codes and induced distributions,

called strategies. To ensure the feedback capacity (to be deﬁned shortly) is well-posed, we introduce the

following condition:

Our methodology is based on the following main steps.

lower bound on the characterization of C∞,n f b(κ, v0) deﬁned by (I.13), of the AGN channel driven by

for n = 1, 2, . . .. This step is analogous to [15, Theorem 4.1], although the models considered in [15]
involve a classical control DRE and ARE.

Step 4. We show the characterization of feedback capacity given in [1, Theorem 6.1, CFB] (i.e., the
limiting expression of C∞(κ, v0), without the stabilizability condition), and with a zero variance of the
innovations part of the channel input process (see [1, Lemma 6.1]), gives an incorrect value of CFB.
However, when the stabilizability conditions is imposed (which is necessary for asymptotic limits to
exists) then it follows the value CFB = 0; clearly an incorrect limiting value of (I.12).

and present a preliminary elaboration on technical issues that are integral part of capacity deﬁnition (I.12).
In Section III, we present the derivations of feedback capacity formulas of C∞(κ, v0) = C∞(κ),
v0, i.e.,
(I.12), and the achievable lower bounds on the non-feedback capacity C∞,n f b(κ, v0), for stable and unstable

In Section IV we collect and discuss some of the oversights in [1], which are also repeated in [9]–[12].

For the rest of this section, we follow a rather unconventional presentation; we present a summary of the

main results of the paper, with informative simulations of achievable rates.

Below, we introduce the characterization of the n
FTFI capacity, for an AGN channel, driven by the

time-varying AR(ct) noise, for the feedback code of Deﬁnition I.1.(a). Our presentation, of the next
theorem, is based on the degenerate case of the general characterization of the n

channels, derived in [17]. We should mention that although, [8], treats AGN channels driven by stable

noise, some parts of the representation given below can be extracted from the analysis of [8, Section II-V].

Theorem II.1. Characterization of n

FTFI Capacity for AGN Channels Driven by AR(ct) Noise

Deﬁnition I.1.(a). Then the following hold.

B. Some Preliminary Facts on Generalized Difference and Algebraic Riccati Equations

At this point we pause to discuss several facts, to provide insight into the questions of asymptotic analysis,
of C(κ, s0), deﬁned by (I.11), and C∞(κ, v0) deﬁned by (I.12), based on the properties of generalized
DREs and AREs. These are well-developed in the systems and control theory literature, for control and

estimation problems [13], [14]. The reader ﬁnds a more detailed presentation in Section III, Section III-B,

and Theorem III.1.

Fact 1. The generalized time-varying Kalman-ﬁlter with correlated state and observation noise.
The deﬁnition of the innovations process In of Y n, i.e., (II.62), (II.63), implies the the generalized Kalman-
ﬁlter recursions (II.60)-(II.67), correspond to the problem of estimating X n from Y n, of the system:

(II.73)

(II.74)

The terminology, “generalized DREs” is often used in the literature, because in system (II.72), (II.73),
the noises entering V n and Y n are correlated. The noise covariance, for system (II.52), (II.54), or system
(II.72), (II.73) is thus, deﬁned by

By [14], it follows that the generalized time-varying DRE (II.67), equivalently (II.77), is the time-varying

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

version of the one studied in [14, Section 17.7, i.e., eqn(14.7.1), and throughout the book, for S

= 0].
That is, the Kalman-ﬁlter (II.60)-(II.67) or equivalently, the Kalman-ﬁlter for (II.72), (II.73), is not the

classical Kalman-ﬁlter. The generalized Kalman-ﬁlter (II.60)-(II.67) reduces to the classical Kalman-ﬁlter
if and only if the noise W n does not enter Y n or Y n

, that is, S = 0 (see the notation in [14, S = 0]).

Fact 2. On the convergence of solutions of time-invariant generalized DREs to solutions of AREs.
For the time-invariant AR(c) noise, i.e., ct = c, KWt = KW ,t = 1, . . . , n, consider the time-invariant channel
input distributions or strategies, i.e., Λt = Λ∞, KZt = K∞
Z ,t = 1, . . . , n, which do not imply the corresponding
generated process (X o,Y o) is stationary. Let Ko
t ,t = 0, 1, . . . , n, denote the sequence generated by the
strategies (Λ∞, K∞
Z ). Then from Theorem II.1, we obtain C∞(κ, v0) deﬁned by (I.28), (I.30), that is, the
time-invariant version of the generalized DRE (II.67), equivalently (II.77):

the convergence properties of Ko

fundamentally different from those of the classical Kalman-ﬁlter. In particular, even for the special case

(cid:17)

veriﬁed from the properties of DREs and AREs presented in [14, with S = 0] and [13]: for classical

driven by a Gaussian noise, and such that, the noise is independent of the Gaussian noise entering the

observations, then the detectability and stabilizability conditions are automatically satisﬁed. This implies

the mean-square estimation error of Kalman-ﬁlter converges, to a ﬁnite nonnegative, unique limit, which

satisﬁes a classical ARE. The unique solution of the classical ARE is also stabilizing.

Remark II.2. Facts 1-3 state that certain fundamental technical issues need to be accounted for in the
asymptotic analysis of entropy rates and of the average power in [9]–[12], even if the noise V n is stable,
stationary, etc. to ensure optimal time-invariant channel input strategies induce asymptotic stationarity

of the channel input process, and asymptotic stationarity of the output process (for stable noise).

(C1) the maximizing element, denoted by (Λ∗t , K∗Zt ),t = 1, . . . , n which satisﬁes the average power con-
straint exists, and

(C2) the limit exists in [0, ∞).

Proof. (C1) and (C2) follow from the above discussion; the converse coding theorem is similar to [6].

Remark II.3. By the average power (II.56) and optimization problem (II.70), it is necessary to identify
sufﬁcient and/or necessary conditions such that the maximizing element, (Λ∗t , K∗Zt ),t = 1, . . . , n, exists in
the set, and to ensure convergence of Kn = Ev0
(that satisﬁes the time-varying DRE (II.67)), as

it is necessary that the limit is also independent of v0. On the other hand, if the limit C(κ, v0) depends
on V0 = v0, then one needs to consider a formulation based on compound capacity, by taking inﬁmum
over all initial states V0 = v0, as done, for example, in [18], for ﬁnite state feedback channels, otherwise
different v0 give rise to different rates.

Proof. (a) Similar to the feedback capacity of Theorem II.1, by the maximum entropy of Gaussian
distributions, the maximizing distributions PXt
1,V0,t = 1, . . . , n for the optimization problem (II.85) are
conditionally Gaussian, such that (X n,Y n) for V0 = v0, is jointly Gaussian, the average power constraint
is satisﬁed, and condition (I.5) is respected. Clearly, the restriction to distributions that satisfy (II.86)
result in a lower bound on Cn f b
(κ, v0) deﬁned by (II.85). Note that the restriction to (II.86) is precisely
the restriction of feedback distributions (II.45) to non-feedback distributions. The rest of the equations

III. NEW FORMULAS OF CAPACITY OF AGN CHANNELS DRIVEN BY STABLE AND UNSTABLE

AR(c) NOISE AND GENERALIZED RICCATI EQUATIONS

In this section we derive a closed form formula for feedback capacity C∞(κ, v0), deﬁned by (I.12), and
lower bounds on capacity without feedback C∞,n f b(κ, v0), deﬁned by (I.13), of AGN channels driven by
AR(c), stable and unstable noise, when channel input strategies or distributions are time-invariant. This
section includes material on basic properties of generalized DREs, AREs, and deﬁnitions and implications

of the notions of detectability and stabilizability, which are discussed in Section II-B.

A. Characterization of Feedback Capacity for Time-Invariant Channel Input Distributions

We restrict the class of channel input distributions of Theorem II.1 to the class of time-invariant distri-

butions. We note that our restriction is weaker than the analysis in [1], which presupposes stationarity or
asymptotic joint stationarity of the joint Gaussian process (X n,Y n), n = 1, 2, . . . (the author also considers
a double sided joint process). However, unlike [1], [8], we do not assume the AR(c) noise is stable.
By Theorem II.1, and restricting the channel input strategies to the time-invariant channel input strategies,
Z ),t = 1, . . . , n, (not necessarily stationary) then we have the following representation8.

input strategy or distribution ensures the limit exits and C∞(κ, v0) is independent of v0, we shall impose
condition (C1). We shall express condition (C1) in terms of properties of generalized time-invariant DREs

We recall that in the study of mean-square estimation, and in particular, the ﬁltering theory, of time-

invariant jointly Gaussian processes described by linear recursions, driven by Gaussian noise processes,

and of jointly stationary Gaussian processes, the concepts of detectability and stabilizability, have been

Consider the characterization of feedback capacity given in [1, Theorem 6.1, Σ satisfying eqn(61)],

in which the variance of the innovations process is replaced by a zero value (see comment below [1,

Theorem 6.1]). Then Σ = 0 is one solution of [1, Σ satisfying eqn(61)].
We ask: what are necessary and/or sufﬁcient conditions for convergence limn

C. Feedback Capacity of AGN Channels Driven by Time-Invariant Stable/Unstable AR(c) Noise

In this section we analyze the asymptotic per unit time limit of the n

FTFI capacity of Deﬁnition III.1,

by making use of the properties of generalized DREs and AREs of Section III-B to identify sufﬁcient

and necessary conditions, such that condition (C1) holds. Then we derive closed form expressions for
C∞(κ, v0) = C∞(κ),
v0 deﬁned by (III.136), for Regime 1 given by (I.17), and we show that feedback
does not increase C∞(κ), for Regimes 2 and 3 given by (I.19) and (I.18).

Proof. (1) Note that by setting Λ∞ = 0, then the representation of channel input X o,n deﬁned by (III.112)-
(III.130) is used without feedback, and this is a lower bound on the non-feedback capacity. Hence, the

statements follow from Theorem III.2, as a special case.
(2) This follows from (1), since the optimal K∞
(Λ∞,

∗, K∞,

∗Z ) = (0,κ) into the generalized ARE of the constraint (III.173), we obtain

Z occurs on the boundary, i.e., K∞,

Remark III.4. Implications of Theorem III.4 on operational non-feedback capacity for unstable noise.

Theorem III.4.(3), when combined with Theorem III.3, states that, one does not need to presuppose, as

usually done in information theory literature [20]–[22], that the joint channel input and output process,

and noise, are stationary to show existence of achievable non-feedback rates, as done, in the water-ﬁlling

solution. We shall give a tighter lower bound on the non-feedback capacity in Corollary III.1.

Another lower bound on feedback capacity is presented in Section III-C3 (below).

3) Achievable Feedback Rates with Noise Cancellation for Stable AR(c) Noise: Let us recall the repre-
sentation of channel input described by (III.112)-(III.121). If we let Λ∞ =
c, then (III.114) and (III.115),
reduce to the equations Y o
1 + cV0 +W1. This means, for the choice
of strategy Λ∞ =

which mean Vt and Y o
is

t ,t = 2, . . . , n,Y o

D. Lower Bound on Characterization of Capacity without Feedback for Time-Invariant Channel Input

Distributions

By recalling the lower bound of Corollary II.1, and by restricting the non-feedback strategies to the
∞
time-invariant channel input strategies, (Λt , KZt ) = (Λ
Z ),t = 1, . . . , n, then we have a representation of
(X o,n,Y o,n), as in Section III-A. The next corollary gives an achievable lower bound on the characterization
of non-feedback capacity, as a time-invariant optimization problem, which is analogous to Theorem III.2.

IV. DISCUSSION OF RELATED LITERATURE AND COMPARISON WITH MAIN RESULTS OF THE PAPER

In this section we recall the formulation and some of the results of [6] and compare them with [1], [8]

and with recent results in [9]–[12], with emphasis on the assumptions based on which these are derived.

Then we specialize some of the results to AGN channels driven by the AR(c) stable noise, to point out
some of the oversights, which are overlooked in [1], and are repeated in [9]–[12].

A. Cover and Pombra Characterization of Feedback Capacity

B. Observations on the Feedback Codes and Optimal Channel Inpus of Past Literature

In this section, we make some observations on the optimal channel inputs, that are used in [8], and applied

in [1] to derive the main theorem [1, Theorem 6.1]. From these observations then follows that neither

[1, Theorem 6.1] (and also [1, Theorem 4.1]) nor [9]–[12], characterize the feedback capacity for the

Cover and Pombra [6] formulation of feedback code (with limit and supremum operations interchanged)

of stationary channels.

(IV.226)

In [8, Section II.C, eqn(19), eqn(20)], the noise is represented by a particular state space realization,
with state variables Sn △= (S1, . . . , Sn), under the following crucial assumption10.

(cid:17)

(A1) [8, page 933, I)-III)]: given the initial state of the noise S0 = s0, which is known to the encoder and
the decoder, the channel input X n △= (X1, . . . , Xn) uniquely deﬁnes the state variables Sn and vice-versa.

−

Then, under Assumotion (A1), in [8, Section II-V], the optimal channel input X n is expressed in terms
of the state Sn, its initial state S0 = s0, the outputs Y n, and a Gaussian innovations process (see [8,
Theorem 5, eqn(114)]). The n

FTFI capacity is characterized by [8, eqn(131)].

(2) In [1, Theorem 6.1] the characterization of feedback capacity is derived by invoking an equivalent

state space representation of the noise (IV.226), given by [1, eqn(58)], i.e.,

St+1 =FSt + GWt , S0 = 0,W0 = 0,

t = 0, . . . ,

Vt =HSt + GWt ,

t = 1, . . . ,

(IV.227)

(IV.228)

where Wt ,t = 1, . . . , are independent, Gaussian, independent of the Gaussian RV S0, and F, G, H are
matrices of dimensions L

L, respectively. St is called the state of the noise.

L, L

Although, not explicitly stated in [1], from [1, Lemma 6.1] (which is used to derive [1, Theorem 6.1]),

×

×

it follows a crucial assumption, which is analogous to (A1) (see also [1, page 78, left column, ﬁrst

paragraph]):

(A2) [1, Theorem 6.1 and Lemma 6.1]: Given the initial state of the noise S0 = s0,W0 = w0, which is
known to the encoder and the decoder, the noise V n uniquely deﬁnes the state variables Sn and vice-versa.

(3) In Cover and Pombra [6] the code deﬁnition and optimal channel input process X n, i.e., (IV.217),
are not allowed to depend on the state variables Sn and the initial states, i.e., assumptions (A1) or (A2)
are not imposed, and hence Sn needs to be estimated at the encoder. Because assumptions (A1) and
(A2) are imposed in the feedback capacity problem analyzed in [8] and characterization of feedback

capacity in [1, Theorem 6.1] (see also [1, Lemma 6.1]), respectively, then [8] and [1, Theorem 6.1] treat

a fundamentally different and much easier problem than the Cover and Pombra [6].

Papers [9]–[12] should be read with caution, because the misinterpretations discussed above are repeated.

For example, [9], [10], [12] developed their results based on [1, Theorem 4.1] which is equivalent to

10If (A1) does not hold then the characterization of the n

FTFI capacity [8, Sections II-V] is not valid.

−

August 16, 2021

DRAFT

[1, Theorem 6.1], hence the discussion under (2) applies to these references.

In [11] the related to the presentation of [1, Theorem 6.1], such as, in [11, page 1949 second column],

and [11, Section IV ﬁrst paragraph], is misleading because the discussion under (2) applies. In [11,
Theorem 2], the optimal channel input is a function of the state process Sn, and hence the discussion
under (2) applies as well.

C. Preliminary Observations on Convergence of Feedback Rates

In this section we make preliminary observation on conditions for existence of the limits of the feed-

back capacity deﬁnition (I.12), which are not accounted for in [1, Theorem 6.1] (equivalently in [1,

Theorem 4.1]). These are also overlooked in [9]–[12], when use is made of the results of [1]. For the

stationary AR(c) noise, the feedback capacity characterizations given in [1, Theorem 6.1], and similarly
in [1, Theorem 4.1], correspond to K∞
Z = 0, (see [1, Lemma 6.1] and comments above it), which means
the stabilizability condition (see Deﬁnition III.3) is not satisﬁed.

Observation IV.2. On the feedback capacity characterizations given in [1]

(1) Observe that the characterization of feedback capacity given in [1, Theorem 6.1] for the state space

representation of the noise (IV.227), (IV.228), with zero variance of the innovations of the channel input

process, implies one solution to the symmetric matrix algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) [1, Eqn(61)

satisﬁed by Σ], is always the zero matrix solution Σ = 0.
An important technical issue, which is overlooked in the treatment of the asymptotic analysis in [1],
is the fact that, the estimation error covariance11 of the noise V n satisﬁes a generalized difference
Riccati equation12 (DRE) [14], and not a classical DRE (see Section III). It then follows from the
theory of generalized DREs and AREs [13], [14], (see properties of Theorem III.1), that even for the

stable and stationary channel noise considered in [1], to ensure asymptotic stationarity of the optimal

joint channel input and output process, it is necessary that the conditions, known as detectability and
stabilizability conditions should be appended to the deﬁnition of characterization of feedback capacity13
in [1, Theorem 6.1]. When these conditions are appended, then the feedback capacity is fundamentally

different from the one given in [1, Theorem 6.1].

Two special cases are discussed below.

11Σ in the notation of [1].

12Generalized DREs and algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) are well-known in ﬁltering problems of Gaussian systems, where

the state to be estimated is driven by a Gaussian noise, which is correlated with the Gaussian noise that drives the observed

process, i.e., the process that is used to estimate the state process [13], [14].

13It appears [1] did not recognize that stability or stationarity of the noise is not sufﬁcient for detectability and stabilizability

to hold, as in classical differerence and algebraic equations. This is also not accounted for in [11].

DRAFT

43

Case 1. Consider the asymptotically stationary AR(c) noise. From the generalized ARE (I.32) of K∞,
Z = 0, then it follows that (K∞, Λ∞) is the
with a zero variance of the innovations of the channel input, K∞
analog of (Σ, X ) in [1, Theorem 6.1]. The equation of K∞, with K∞
Z = 0, is a quadratic polynomial, with
two roots, one at K∞ = 0, and another at K∞ = K∞(Λ∞), given in (II.81)-(II.83) (by simple algebra).
It then follows from the general properties of generalized matrix difference RIccati equations [14] (see

Theorem III.1, Lemma III.2 for its application to the AR(c) noise), that the asymptotic limit of the mean-
K∞ = 0, and not the maximal solution. This
square estimation error converges to the zero solution Σ
then implies, the feedback capacity based on [1, Theorem 6.1, CFB] is zero.
Case 2. Consider the PSD (IV.226), with L = 1, denoted by AR(a, c), given in [1, eqn(43)]:

Similarly to Case 1, the ARE [1, Theorem 6.1, eqn(61) satisﬁed by Σ], is a quadratic polynomial in Σ,

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

= 0 (one root is always zero because
with two solutions, the zero solution Σ = 0, and a nonzero solution Σ
K∞
Z = 0). It is easy to verify that the choice of the nonzero solution gives directly the statement of [1,
Theorem 5.3] (which is derived using a lengthy derivation from the frequency domain characterization

of [1, Theorem 4.1]).

However, similarly to (1) it follows from the general properties of generalized matrix difference Riccati

equations [14], that the asymptotic limit of the mean-square estimation error converges to the zero
K∞ = 0, and not the nonzero solution, which then implies the feedback capacity based on

solution Σ
[1, Theorem 6.1, CFB] is zero.
The above technical oversights are also discussed in Remark III.1, and follow from Section II-A, Facts

1-3. We also give an alternative derivation in Section IV-D (see Counterexample IV.1).

Papers [9]–[12] should be read with caution, because the technical issues discussed above are repeated.

D. The Kim Characterization of Feedback Capacity

Let us now recall the characterization of feedback capacity given in [1, Theorem 6.1] for the stable
AR(c) noise, with V0 = v0, known to the encoder and the decoder, which presupposes the variance of the
innovations of the channel input process is zero, i.e., K∞
Z = 0 in the generalized ARE of Theorem III.2.

The (incorrect) simpliﬁed characterizations of the feedback capacity i.e., with zero power spectral density

and zero variance of the innovations process of the channel input, of [1, Theorem 4.1] and [1, Theo-

rem 6.1], respectively, are utilized extensively in the literature, and stimulated the interest into additional

investigations, by many authors, for example, [9]–[12].

The next proposition summarizes the implications of the properties of generalized DREs and AREs of

Theorem III.1, and Lemma III.2, on the characterization of feedback capacity given in [1, Theorem 4.1

and Theorem 6.1].

Proof. The statements follow from Theorem III.1 and Lemma III.2.

Z = 0, that let to the incorrect
characterization of feedback capacity [1, Theorem 6.1] (and also to [1, Theorem 4.1]), by calculating

the transition map of the error recursion of the generalized Kalman-ﬁlter. An alternative approach to

construct a counterexample, is to follow the statements prior to [14, Lemma 14.2.1, page 507], for the

generalized DRE and ARE, using its transform version, as discussed in [14, Section 14.7, page 540].

when channel input strategies or distributions are time-invariant, for autoregressive memory one, stable

and unstable noises, It is shown that feedback does not increase capacity, when the noise is stable and for

certain unstable noise. Lower bounds on the non-feedback capacity are also derived, based on Markov

channel input distributions, i.e., induced by a Gaussian Markov channel input process, and also by an

independent and identically distributed channel input process. These achievable lower bounds on non-

feedback capacity hold for any autoregressive noise model, irrespective of whether it is stable or unstable.

An interesting long standing unanswered question, is to derive a closed form expression for the n

capacity, to gain insight into the performance of achievable time-varying rates.

∗Z > 0. If such
κ does not exists, then, we can exhibit a non-zero rate without feedback by considering time-invariant

(ii) Second, we recall Lemma III.3.(v), which states a necessary condition for existence of a non-zero

(iii) Consider λ∗1 > 0, λ∗2 > 0, λ∗3 = 0 and λ∗4 = 0. We solve the system of equations (VI.261)-(VI.263),
(VI.264) and (VI.267). First we solve the system of equations (VI.261) and (VI.262) to obtain λ∗1 and λ∗2
