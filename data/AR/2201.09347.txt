ABSTRACT 

We  show  that  a  metasurface-coated  two-dimensional  (2D)  slab  waveguide  enables  the 

generation of arbitrary complex light fields by combining the extreme versatility and freedom on 

wavefront control of optical metasurfaces with the compactness of photonic integrated circuits. 

We demonstrated off-chip 2D focusing and holographic projection with our metasurface-dressed 

photonic  integrated  devices.  This  technology  holds  the  potential  for  many  other  optical 

applications  requiring  2D  light  field  manipulation  with  full  on-chip  integration,  such  as  solid-

state LiDAR and near-eye AR/VR displays.

Metasurfaces1,2  composed  of  artificially  engineered 

light-emitting  pixels  arbitrarily 

programmed  provide  versatile  platforms  for  both  fundamental  research  and  practical 

applications.  The  metasurface  allows  complete  control  over  electromagnetic  field  properties, 

including  phase,  amplitude,  and  polarization.  It  enables  various  applications  such  as 

metalenses3,4,  holograms5-7,  OAM  generations1,8,  and  polarimeters9,10.  The 

functional 

metasurface-based  flat  optics  can  be  made  ultrathin,  but  most  demonstrated  ones  cannot  work 

without free space11, making it difficult for fully on-chip integration. 

The photonic integrated circuits (PICs)12,13, where light is wired on a chip through functional 

optical  components  such  as  waveguides,  modulators14,  and  multiplexers/demultiplexers15, 

provide a long-term solution for fast-growing demands on bandwidth and speed in information 

systems in recent years. PICs could potentially reduce the complexity and cost, and increase the 

stability,  repeatability,  and  scalability  for  future  high-yield  production.  Building  interfaces 

between free-space light and guided modes propagating on chips is crucial to realize PIC-based 

devices with extended functionality.  Currently, mature  coupling  technologies between PIC  and 

free  space  are  mainly  based  on  edge  coupling16  and  grating  coupling17,  whose  functions  are 

limited due to the lack of complete control on scattered electromagnetic waves.  

By combining the versatility of metasurfaces and the compactness of PIC-based systems, new 

platforms with improved functionalities have been demonstrated. For example, an in-plane mode 

converter based on metasurface coated waveguides has been shown18. Similarly, researchers also 

have  shown  a  compact  mode-division  multiplexing  PIC  and  on-chip  wavefront  shaping 

components19-21. We have recently demonstrated a versatile platform where free-space light can 

be flexibly molded into arbitrary free-space optical modes by exploiting the collective behavior 

of  nanoantennas  coated  on  top  of  a  waveguide22.  We  showed  flexible  free-space  light 

3 

 
manipulation,  including  directional  coupling,  off-chip  focusing,  and  optical  vortex  generation, 

from guided waves in a metasurface-coated single-mode ridge waveguide. In contrast to the in-

plane  meta-waveguides  that  could  only  manipulate  waves  without  involving  free  space, 

nanoantennas integrated onto waveguides based on their particular property. 

Figure 1. Schematic plot of 2D guided-wave-fed metasurface. Propagating wave injected into the 

slab waveguide interacts with the metasurface on top are scattered with designed wavefront for a 

specific function (off-chip focusing here). 

Our  earlier  work  provided  a  practical  approach  to  realize  one-dimensional  (1D)  light  field 

phase  manipulation.  Furthermore,  polarization  and  wavelength  (de)multiplexing  between  free 

space and one-dimensional ridge waveguide were also reported23-25.  However, light field control 

through two dimensions with higher flexibility is required for further advanced applications. For 

instance, light detection and ranging (LiDAR)26,27 with a long propagation distance are more in 

favor  of  a  larger  device  aperture  size  in  both  dimensions  to  control  the  diffraction.  Near-eye 

4 

 
 
holographic  display  for  augmented  reality  (AR)  /  virtual  reality  (VR)28,29  also  requires  two-

dimensional  (2D)  phase  control.  Although  constructing  arrayed  single-mode  waveguides  could 

be a potential approach to realize 2D wave manipulation, different phase offsets and neighboring 

couplings  between  adjacent  waveguides  need  to  be  addressed  by  phase  compensation  such  as 

electro-photo  modulation,  which  increases  system  complexity  and  hinders  actual  pixel  density. 

In this work, we extended the capability of using metasurface to control scattered light from 1D 

to 2D. By placing metal-dielectric-metal meta-atoms on top of a slab waveguide, we can tune the 

phase  of  scattered  light  covering  2

.  Compared  to  our  earlier  work,  the  mode  conversion  and 

intensity  distribution  inside  the  waveguide  were  investigated  for  2D  manipulation.  Based  on 

𝜋𝜋

these,  we  demonstrated  different  functions  such  as  2D  metalenses,  as  conceptually  shown  in 

Figure 1, and holograms  on waveguides experimentally or numerically.  Our  work  showed that 

with  2D  light  field  manipulation  capability,  the  proposed  structure  was  able  to  realize  more 

functions. 

Starting from a simple case, we considered a guided wave of fundamental mode propagating 

inside a slab waveguide having a plane wavefront perpendicular to the propagation direction 

, 

with a propagation constant 

. We then put a 2D metasurface on top of the slab waveguide, and 

𝑥𝑥

the  guided  wave  in  the  waveguide  evanescently  coupled  with  the  nanoantennas  of  the 

𝛽𝛽

metasurface. Being excited, the nanoantennas extracted  a small portion of the guided light into 

free  space  with  imposed  phase  lags.  Therefore,  we  were  able  to  construct  a  metasurface 

composed of nanoantennas that could locally tune the phase 

 as

nanoantennas  we  used  here  are  metal-insulator-metal  (MIM)  sandwiched  nanobars,  supporting 

both electric and magnetic dipolar resonances around the desired operational wavelength (1550 

nm)22.  By  changing  the  dimensions  (length  and  width)  of  the  nanobars,  we  get  a  phase  lag 

from each nanoantenna that can range from 0 to 

. To design the device, we built a 

𝜑𝜑𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) 
phase-amplitude  response  library  with  regard  to  the  nanoantenna  dimensions  using  full-wave 

2𝜋𝜋

simulations  with  a  commercially  available  finite  element  method  (FEM)  solver  COMSOL 

Multiphysics.  A  sandwiched  nanobar  composed  of  stacked  Au,  Si,  and  Au  layers,  with  a 

thickness of 30 nm for each layer, was placed  on top of a 500-nm-thick  Si  slab waveguide on 

SiO2  substrate.  In  our  simulation,  a  fundamental  TE  mode,  numerically  obtained  by  an 

eigenmode solver, was excited at the input port of the Si slab waveguide and propagated through 

the waveguide. The modal index of this TE00 mode 

 was also provided by the solver. The 

scattered  light  from  the  nanobar  was  monitored  right  above  the  center  of  the  nanobar.  We 

𝑛𝑛𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

obtained both the amplitude and phase of the scattered electric field. Keeping the thickness of the 

nanobar  unchanged,  we  swept  the  width  (

)  and  length  (

100𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ≤ 𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦 ≤
)  of  the  nanobar  to  get  a  phase/amplitude-geometries  map.  Taking  into  account  the 

90 nm ≤ 𝑙𝑙𝑥𝑥 ≤ 130 nm

400𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛
nanofabrication imperfection, trapezoidal vertical cross-sessions and fillets of the nanobar were 

built  in  our  numerical  model.  Based  on  the  phase/amplitude-geometries  map,  three  different 

nanobars geometries with the same scattered electric field amplitude and phases equaling 

, and 

2𝜋𝜋/3,
 respectively, were selected as the building blocks for the metasurface. Therefore, 

0
an arbitrary phase profile expanding through the 2D functional area could be realized by spatially 

−2𝜋𝜋/3,

arranging  this  set  of  three  nanoantennas  with  different  geometrical  parameters.  It  is  worth 

pointing out that to achieve the precise control of the desired phase profile, the field distribution 

of  the  input  guided  wave  needs  to  be  taken  into  consideration  throughout  the  region.  For 

6 

 
simplicity, we kept the wavefront inside the slab waveguide flat through the propagation in our 

proof-of-concept  demonstration.  To  assure  this,  (1)  the  input  mode  needs  to  be  purely 

fundamental without any other modes, and (2) the metasurface on top of the waveguide does not 

affect  the  propagating  mode  remarkably.  In  other  words,  the  influence  of  the  nanobars  on  the 

guided wave is negligible to avoid mode conversion  inside  the  slab waveguide.  Otherwise, the 

phase provided by the propagation 

 could be inaccurate.

As  a  proof-of-concept  demonstration  of  our  proposed  schematics  on  2D  on-chip  light  field 

manipulation, we first numerically and experimentally demonstrated an integrated 2D metalens 

on a waveguide. Then, we presented a holographic projection directly from a slab waveguide for 

a more general manifestation.  

To generate a focused beam in free space, the phase of light scattered from the metasurface has 

a distribution described below 

where

𝜑𝜑𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦)

 to  the  nearest  discrete  phase  levels  (

)  and  chose  the  nanobar 

𝜑𝜑𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦)
geometries  accordingly.  Then  the  entire  device  was  established  by  arranging  this  set  of

nanoantennas on top of a 500-nm-thick silicon slab waveguide on a glass substrate.  As a proof 

of concept, we numerically simulated a 

2D metalens on a silicon waveguide with a 

focal length of 

. The period along and perpendicular to the propagation direction is 220 nm 

5 μm × 5 μm 

and  440  nm,  respectively.  TE00  mode  light  injected  into  the  slab  waveguide  from  its  left  port

propagated through the metasurface region.

The  simulation  results  show  that  a  portion  of  the  guided  wave  was  extracted  directly  by  the 

metasurface  on  top  of  the  slab  waveguide.  The  extracted  light  was  focused  on  a  focal  spot  at 

 above the slab waveguide (Figure 2(a)-(c)). The intensity distribution at the focal plane 

~5 μm
manifested  an  Airy  disk  with  a  full-width-half-maximum  (FWHM)  of  about 

,  which 

matched our theoretical prediction well (Figure 2(d)). We conducted mode decomposition for the 

2.1 μm

guided wave in the slab waveguide after the metasurface. The result in Figure 2(f) shows that the 

transmitted  field  barely  had  high-order  modes  (transmitted  intensity  <  0.01%)  other  than 

fundamental  TE00  (transmitted  intensity  >  67%).  The  electric  field,  of  which  the  real  part  is 

shown in Figure 2(e), underneath the metasurface did not show noticeable distortion, manifesting 

that the nanoantennas we used here induce negligible mode conversion inside the waveguide.

We  designed  and  fabricated  a  guided-wave-fed  2D  metalens  using  two  electron  beam 

lithography  steps  with  precise  alignment  to  define  the  silicon  waveguide  and  the  metasurface 

with  processes  similar  to  those  in  Ref.  22.  The  SEM  image  of  fabricated  metasurface  on  the 

waveguide  is  shown  in  Figure  3(a).  The  metasurface  region  has  a  size  of 

, 

and the focal length was designed to be 

17.6 μm × 17.6 μm
. An edge-coupling port connected with a single-

mode  waveguide  was  used  to  eliminate  higher-order  propagation  modes.  The  single-mode 

20 μm

waveguide  was  immediately  followed  by  a  taper  which  could  adiabatically  convert  the 

fundamental TE00 mode from the single-mode waveguide into a TE00 mode with extended width 

in  the  slab  waveguide30.  Both  two  parts  guaranteed  that  the  guided  wave  impinging  the 

metasurface region had a flat wavefront. We obtained three-dimensional (3D) scattered-out light 

field distribution above the device using a home-built optical setup, as shown in Figure 3(b). A 

free-space laser  beam of 1550 nm emitted from a  Ti:Sapphire laser-pumped optical  parametric 

oscillator  (OPO)  was  coupled  into  a  commercially  available  polarization-maintaining  taper-

lensed  single-mode  fiber.  The  focused  laser  beam  from  the  tapered  end  of  the  fiber  was  edge-

coupled  into  the  input  port  of  our  fabricated  ridge  waveguide  sample  in  an  end-fire  approach 

using  a  3D  translational  stage.  The  light  scattered  into  free  space  by  metasurface  on  the  slab 

waveguide was collected by an objective (N.A. = 0.95) and then imaged by a tube lens onto an 

infrared  camera.  The  objective  was  mounted  on  a  translational  stage  with  a  high-resolution 

piezo-controlled actuator in the z-direction. By moving the z stage,  2D real-space images were 

10 

 
taken  at  different  heights,  and  a  3D  volumetric  image  was  reconstructed  by  stacking  the  2D 

images. After that, we extracted the intensity distribution at X-Z and Y-Z cross-section, as shown 

in  Figures  3  (c)  and  (d),  respectively.  Our  experimental  result  showed  a  similar  intensity 

distribution profile as that in our simulations (Figure 2). We observed the light scattered out by 

the metasurface gradually focused on the height around 18

, as shown in Figure 3(e), close to 

the designed focal length. The FWHM of the focal spot intensity distribution at the focal plane is 

 μm

about 

 as  shown  in  Figure  3(f),  which  is  slightly  larger  than  the  theoretical  expectation 

(

 1.8 μm
).

More generally,  by leveraging the  freedom  to  control  the  phase profile of  scattered light, we 

demonstrated  a  3D  holographic  projection  directly  from  a  guided-wave-fed  metasurface. 

Hologram-based  near-eye  display  generating  3D  images  carrying  depth  information  is  a 

promising  solution  for 

the  vergence-accommodation-conflict  (VAC) 

in  AR/VR31,  and 

incorporating  hologram  in  the  form  of  compactness  and  lightweight  is  crucial  for  developing 

11 

 
 
next-generation head-mounted-devices (HMD). By mapping  the  phase  profile of  a  holographic 

image  onto  the  metasurface-coated  waveguide,  we  demonstrated  the  capability  of  utilizing  our 

platform  for  this  specific  application.  First,  we  calculated  the  intensity  distribution  in  the  slab 

waveguide.  In  our  slab  waveguide  configuration,  the  intensity  distribution  was  a  decaying 

Gaussian function, which can be approximated represented by

calculated the required phase distribution at the metasurface plane using a modified Gerchberg–

Saxton  (G-S)  algorithm  for  a  required  image  floating  at  a  specific  height.  In  this  step,  the 

intensity distribution in  the  slab waveguide  served  as the source  intensity.  The  goal was to get 

the source phase. The intensity and phase formed a complex-valued wavefront which generates 

desired intensity distribution (target image) at the image plane  after diffraction. Then, the final 

source phase profile  was calculated  by  calculating  forward  and  backward  propagation between 

the  source  plane  and  target  plane  with  fixed  intensity  distribution  iteratively.  The  diffraction 

propagation  between  the  source  plane  and  the  image  plane  was  modeled  using  the  angular 

spectrum method. The source phase profile converged to the results after several iterations. The 

phase  needs  to  be  compensated  from  the  propagation  phase  inside  the  slab  waveguide  was 

calculated according to equation (1). After that, the geometric parameters of the antennas in each 

 unit  cell  were  determined.  We  constructed  a 

 sized 

220 nm × 440 nm
hologram,  which  corresponding  to 

 pixels,  on  a  slab  waveguide.  In  our  hologram

calculation  using  Matlab,  to  get  a  more  accurate  phase  profile  representation,  we  used  four 

different nanoantennas with a phase lag of 

. It is worth mentioning that, in the 

hologram  construction,  the  four-level  nanoantenna  set  did  not  have  a  constant  scattering

efficiency.  Despite  that  the  amplitude  distribution  was  quite  nonuniform  (Figure  4(a))  and  the 

phase  distribution  was  discretized  (Figure  4(b),  we  got  a  clear  holographic  imaging  floating 

20

 above the metasurface plane (Figure 4(c)).  

 μm
The  2D  light  field  manipulation  enabled  by  combining  metasurfaces  and  waveguides  with 

flexible  phase  controllability  and  functionality  was  demonstrated.  This  technique  allows  free-

space 2D structured light to generate directly from an integrated photonic chip within a compact 

form factor. To assure accurate phase manipulation, we kept the metasurface perturbation to the 

guided  wave  small  enough  to  avoid  mode  conversion  in  this  proof-of-concept  demonstration. 

However, this is not a stringent requirement. For instance, more significant perturbation was also 

considered  in  the  design  process,  using  the  electromagnetic  inverse  design  method32. 

Furthermore, due to the energy decaying inside the waveguide, the actual device size is inversely 

proportional to the scattering efficiency of the metasurface. It is worth noting that as our system 

is  linear  and  time-invariant,  possessing  time-reversal  symmetry,  it  is  reciprocal  and  able  to 

convert  free-space  modes  into  waveguide  modes.  In  fact,  free-space  modes  to  guided  modes 

conversion using 1D metasurfaces on a waveguide has been demonstrated numerically23. 

In  conclusion,  we  demonstrated  functional  2D  metasurfaces  integrated  on  a  slab  waveguide 

driven  by  a  guided  wave.  An  off-chip  focusing  function  was  demonstrated  numerically  and 

experimentally.  The  designed  numerical  aperture  is  0.4,  and  the  focused  beam  has  a  near-

diffraction-limited spot size in the experiment. For a more general phase control demonstration, 

we  also  numerically  constructed  holographic  projection  using  this  approach.  The  calculation 

13 

 
shows that this platform can be used for hologram generation with a decaying energy distribution 

and discretized (4-level) phase profile. Therefore, the developed platform could be exploited for 

many  other  optical  applications  requiring  2D  light  field  manipulation  with  full  on-chip 

integration,  such  as  solid-state  LiDAR  and  head-mounted  AR/VR  displays.  Furthermore,  it  is 

possible  to  incorporate  detour  phase  metasurfaces33  as  well  as  tunable  metasurfaces34,35  on  a 

waveguide, which could lead to more degrees of freedom and new applications.
