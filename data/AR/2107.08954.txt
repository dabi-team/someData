The fragmentation of carbon monoxide dimers induced by collisions with low energy Ar9+ ions
is investigated using the COLTRIMS technique. The presence of a neighbor molecule in the dimer
serves here as a diagnostic tool to probe the lifetimes of the CO2+ molecular dications resulting
from the collision. The existence of metastable states with lifetimes ranging from 2 ps to 200 ns is
clearly evidenced experimentally through a sequential 3-body fragmentation of the dimer, whereas
fast dissociation channels are observed in a so-called concerted 3-body fragmentation process. The
fast fragmentation process leads to a kinetic energy release distribution also observed in collisions
with monomer CO targets. This is found in contradiction with the conclusions of a former study
attributing this fast process to the perturbation induced by the neighbor molecular ion.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Doubly charged diatomic molecular ions have unusual
properties leading to a wide range of lifetimes against dis-
sociation. Their stability depends on both the accessible
decay mechanisms and the position of the populated rovi-
bronic levels with respect to the barrier height. Among
the large variety of doubly charged diatomic species in-
vestigated so far, CO2+ is probably the one that has at-
tracted the largest interest, with measured lifetimes rang-
ing from submicroseconds to a few seconds. Since its ﬁrst
observation within a mass spectrometer in 1932 [1], the
lifetime of metastable states of CO2+ has been widely
studied both experimentally and theoretically. The exis-
tence of excited states with lifetimes in the millisecond
range and up to few seconds have been demonstrated us-
ing an ion storage ring [2]. Shorter lifetimes in the 10 ns
to 1 µs range have also been identiﬁed [3,4]. In parallel,
computational studies have shown that only the lowest
vibronic levels (υ ≤ 3) of the electronic ground state (3Π)
and low lying states (1Σ+, 1Π and 3Σ+) of CO2+ have
lifetimes longer than 1 ns [5,6,7]. The decay rate of these
states was found to be mainly governed by tunneling or
by predissociation to the repulsive 3Σ− state [8].

More recently, a fast dissociation channel of the CO2+
molecular dication has been observed in the 3-body
breakup of triply charged dimers (CO)3+
ionized by in-
tense ultrashort laser pulses [9]. However, this fast pro-
cess was found to be associated with a higher kinetic
energy release (KER) distribution than expected when
compared to the dissociation of the isolated CO2+ molec-
ular ion. The authors suggested that this fast process
would only exist in a van der Waals complex thanks to the
weak coupling with a neighbor CO+ molecular ion. The

symmetry breaking induced by the counter charge then
leads to an avoided crossing with a dissociation channel,
whereas the monomer would dissociate only via a weaker
spin-orbit coupling.

2

In the present work, we revisit this investigation us-
ing Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) of triply charged
(CO)3+
dimers ionized by low energy Ar9+ ions. The
presence of a neighbor molecular CO+ ion serves here
as a probe to get insight into the dissociation process of
the other CO2+ molecular ion resulting from the colli-
sion. The detailed study of the kinematic of the 3-body
fragmentation channel provides a clear signature of the
lifetime ranges of the CO2+ dication for several sets of
data. The corresponding KER distributions are then
used to identify the states of the CO2+ molecular ion
initially populated by the collision process. This new in-
vestigation diﬀers from the work of [9] by two aspects:
i) the use of low energy highly charged ions as projec-
tiles, which leads to multiple electron capture from the
target and to the population of states with higher ex-
citation energy, and ii) a higher momentum resolution,
which allows a clearer comparison with the dissociation
of isolated CO2+ molecular ions.

II. EXPERIMENT

The cold target recoil

ion momentum spectroscopy
(COLTRIMS) setup used for this work has already been
described in detail elsewhere [10]. We thus only provide
here a brief description of the method and of the exper-
imental conditions. The 135 keV Ar9+ projectile beam
was sent to the experiment through the ARIBE/GANIL
facility. After beam collimation by a 600 µm aperture,
the projectile ions collided with a supersonic gas jet tar-
get composed of ∼ 99% of CO molecules (monomers) and
∼ 1% of (CO)2 dimers. The scattered projectile were
charge selected using a set of deﬂection plates combined

with a position sensitive detector. The fragments of the
ionized targets were collected on a second 80 mm diame-
ter position sensitive detector thanks to a 40 V/cm elec-
tric ﬁeld. The position and time of ﬂight (TOF) of each
fragment allowed then the identiﬁcation of their mass-
over-charge ratio and the 3-D reconstruction of their mo-
mentum in the center of mass of the molecular complex.
As reported in [10], special care has been devoted to the
clean selection of the diﬀerent dissociation channels, to
the calibration of the kinetic energy released in the frag-
mentation and to the optimization of the energy resolu-
tion.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Three diﬀerent fragmentation channels will be dis-
cussed. On one hand, the removal of three electrons from
a (CO)2 dimer target can lead to the 2-body dissociation
channel, (CO)3+
2 → CO2+ + CO+, or to the 3-body one,
(CO)3+
2 → CO+ + C+ + O+. From both channels, in-
formation on the lifetime of the states of the transient
CO2+ dication can be extracted. On the other hand,
the fragmentation of isolated CO2+ dications resulting
from collisions with monomers, CO2+ → C+ + O+, was
conjointly studied to serve as a reference for momentum
calibration and to be compared with the dissociation of
CO2+ observed within a (CO)2 dimer target.

A. Experimental results and access to the CO2+
lifetime

The 2-body (CO)3+

2 → CO2++CO+ dissociation chan-
nel was found to contribute to about 7% of the relaxation
of triply charged (CO)3+
2 dimers. Since the TOF of the
CO2+ molecular ion in the spectrometer is about 2.7 µs,
this channel arises from the population of metastable
states with lifetimes that are larger or comparable. Its
low relative intensity results mainly from the low propor-
tion of such metastable states of the CO2+ dication in
comparison with states of shorter lifetime leading to the
competing 3-body channel (CO)3+
2 → CO+ + C+ + O+.
The experimental observables do not allow a direct iden-
tiﬁcation of these very long-lived states that can most
probably be assigned to the lowest vibration levels (υ =
0, 1) of the 3Π and 1Σ+ state of the CO2+ dication [6].
2 → CO+ + C+ + O+ channel is
more interesting as the sharing of the kinetic energy be-
tween the three fragments carries information on both
the lifetime and the initial state of the CO2+ dication.
For (CO)3+
[9] and (CO2)3+
[11], a detailed analysis
2
of the 3-body fragmentation dynamics was already per-
formed using a momentum selection of the singly charged
molecular ion combined with a Newton representation of
the fragments momenta. We use here a slightly diﬀer-
ent method based on Dalitz plots which provides a more
direct selection of diﬀerent typologies of fragmentation

Several features are observed in Fig. 1.a: for yD < 0, a
dense region at the bottom of the vertical axis followed by
a V-shape tail and for yD > 0, a quasi-horizontal band.
Events with yD < 0 correspond to a simultaneous break-
up of both the covalent and van der Waals bonds and
will be referred as concerted fragmentation events. The
exact distribution of these events is directly correlated to
the dissociation dynamics of the CO2+ dication but also
to the initial structure of the dimer. In a previous study
[10] assuming a simultaneous 3-body break-up, Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations have shown that the lowest part
of the Dalitz with its V-shape distribution can be almost
perfectly reproduced by the prompt 3-body fragmenta-
tion of a CO dimer whose initial angles between the van
der Waals bond and the covalent bonds are randomly
distributed. This quasi isotrope orientation was found

as resulting from the low energy barrier between several
conformers of the dimer and from the ﬁnite temperature
of the gas jet. The Dalitz plot obtained in [10] by MC
simulation for this fast fragmentation process is shown in
Fig. 1.b for comparison.

Contrarily, the quasi-horizontal band in the upper part
of the graph is associated to a sequential fragmentation.
In a ﬁrst step, Coulomb repulsion within the triply ion-
ized dimer leads to the fast break-up of the van der
Waals bond. This break-up is then followed by a de-
layed dissociation of the metastable CO2+ dication oc-
curring when both covalent molecular ions have reached
their asymptotic kinetic energy. Note that these events
can only be observed if the fragmentation occurs at a
shorter time than the 2.7 µs TOF of the CO2+ ions. The
density distribution of the sequential events is localized
close to the edge of the Dalitz graph. This is the signa-
ture of an in-plane dissociation: before fragmenting, the
(CO)2+ rotates in the initial plane containing the center-
of-mass of the CO+ ion and the axis of the (CO)2+ di-
cation. Such a rotation in the initial plane has recently
been reported in the sequential 3-body fragmentation of
triatomic molecules [12]. Here we observe a very simi-
lar behavior in the two-step dissociation of non-covalent
molecular dimers.

2

[9] and of (CO2)3+
2

Fig. 1.c shows the kinetic energy of the CO+ ion for
the selection windows of the Dalitz plot corresponding to
sequential and concerted events. As previously observed
for the fragmentation of (CO)3+
[11]
dimers, the distributions associated to a concerted or to
a sequential dissociation are clearly diﬀerent. The energy
of the main peak at 3.2 eV (in red) corresponds to half
the Coulomb potential energy of the transient dissociat-
ing CO+ + CO2+ system and is a clear signature of a
sequential fragmentation. In such a two-step fragmenta-
tion process, the CO2+ dication breaks up only after the
two recoiling molecular ions have reached the asymptotic
limit for which their relative Coulomb repulsion vanishes.
The CO+ ion thus acquires the exact same kinetic en-
ergy as in the 2-body channel (CO)3+
2 → CO2+ + CO+
i.e. 3.2 eV [10]. The existence of metastable states of
the CO2+ molecular dication is thereby experimentally
and easily evidenced thanks to the presence of the sec-
ond neighbor molecule in the dimer. This is in deep con-
trast with what has been previously obtained using the
same experimental technique for (N2)2 dimers, where no
sign of such a 2-step process could be observed [13]. The
lower part of the CO+ energy spectrum (green line) cor-
responds to the concerted fragmentation where the CO2+
dication dissociates within a much shorter timescale. In
this case, the CO+ acquires a lower kinetic energy be-
cause of the fast repulsion of the two C+ and O+ atomic
ions following the dissociation of the CO2+ dication. The
total KER spectrum in Fig. 1.d shows that the sequen-
tial fragmentation leads to lower KER than the concerted
fragmentation. This can be qualitatively interpreted as
resulting from the population of higher excited states of
the CO2+ dication for the concerted fragmentation events

3

than for the sequential ones.

Three processes have thus been identiﬁed: a concerted
fragmentation process corresponding to the population
of dissociative or very short life states of the CO2+ di-
cation, a sequencial fragmentation process corresponding
to the population of metastable states with lifetimes sig-
niﬁcantly shorter than the 2.7 µs, and the population of
metastable states with lifetimes larger than 2.7 µs whose
dissociation could not be directly observed experimen-
tally.

B. Simulations

In order to quantitatively determine the range of life-
times associated to the sequential process, numerical sim-
ulations based on a simple classical model have been
performed. This model was used beforehand to deter-
mine the geometry of (CO)2 dimers using the concerted
fragmentation events and is described in detail in [10].
Brieﬂy, the triply ionized dimer is initially represented as
three ﬁxed in space and point-like particles with the re-
spective charges and masses of CO+, C+ and O+, where
the C+ and O+ ions compose the dissociating CO2+ dica-
tion with a bond length of 1.13 ˚A. Following the conclu-
sions obtained in [10], the mean intermolecular distance
between the two covalent molecules is set to R=4.2 ˚A.
The mean angle between the dimer axis and the CO2+
molecular axis is set to θi=90° where θi gives the di-
rection of the carbon atom and θi + 180° the direction
of the oxygen atom. Although the initial orientation of
the CO2+ in respect with the dimer axis is expected to
be isotropic [10], the angle θi was here ﬁxed at 90° to
ease the interpretation of the simulation. We will show
later that this simpliﬁcation does not change the overall
conclusions. As in [10], the simulation also accounts for
jitters on the mean value of R.

For the ﬁrst step of the fragmentation, we only consider
a pure Coulombic 2-body fragmentation of the dimer and
compute the trajectories of two point-like molecular ions
CO2+ and CO+, up to a time t. The duration t of the ﬁrst
step depends on the chosen decay constant τ of the CO2+
dication and follows a probability distribution P (t) =
αe−t/τ . The equations of motion are integrated using
a standard Runge-Kutta method and assuming a pure
Coulomb repulsion between the two molecular ions.

The subsequent dissociation of the CO2+ dication is
then simulated in a similar way but with a 3-body inter-
action between the C+, O+ and CO+ ions. In this second
step, the CO2+ dication dissociates at a distance d from
the CO+ molecular ion which depends on the decay time
t and with a new orientation angle θf to account for the
free rotation of the CO2+ molecular ion prior dissocia-
tion. The angle θf between the initial dimer axis and the
CO2+ molecular ion is simply given by θf = θi+2πt/Trot,
where Trot is the rotation period of the CO2+ molecule.
The value of Trot was set to 0.98 ps, which corresponds
to the rotation period obtained within a classical calcu-

4

data. Within this time sequence between 50 fs and 1 ps,
the fact that the right side of the horizontal band is ﬁlled
before the left side arises from our choice to ﬁx θi at
90°. Starting with an isotropic orientation of the CO2+
molecular ion within the dimer would simply result in
the simultaneous ﬁlling of both sides of the band. The
quasi-horizontal band is ﬁnally clearly obtained without
deformation (no remaining events for yD < 0) for dissoci-
ation lifetimes larger than ∼2 ps and remains unchanged
up to ∼200 ns. For large dissociation times t, the re-
construction of the fragments momenta should start to
fail, the duration of the ﬁrst step being neglected in the
data analysis procedure. The present simulations show
that for times up to 200 ns, the reconstruction of the mo-
mentum vectors of the C+ and O+ ions remains accurate
enough to provide the same pattern on the Dalitz plot
as for a 2 fs dissociation time. For dissociation times
larger than 200 ns, the quasi-horizontal band becomes
thicker and the upper part of the Dalitz plot, above the
band, start to be ﬁlled with events. This last change
in the Dalitz ﬁgure arises when the CO2+ fragmentation
occurs at a distance d that is suﬃciently far away from
the collision region to prevent a proper reconstruction of
the fragment momenta. The sequential process observed
experimentally in Fig. 1.a can thus be attributed to the
population of metastable states of the CO2+ molecular
ion with lifetimes comprised between about 2 ps and
200 ns. The same simulations have been performed us-
ing the concerted fragmentation KER distribution. They
have shown that for events identiﬁed with the concerted
fragmentation selection window of Fig. 1.a, the van der
Waals and covalent bonds break appart within less than
10 fs. As can be seen in Fig. 2, this also corresponds to
times that are too short to allow a signiﬁcant acceleration
of the CO+ molecular ion.

We did not observe here metastable states with life-
times of the order 100 fs, but the technique could be
particularly suitable to investigate such states.
If the
CO2+ fragmentation takes place for t ∼ 100 fs, the two
molecular ions are not suﬃciently far away to reach the
asymptotic part of the Fig. 2 and the resulting Dalitz
plots would show speciﬁc patterns as in Fig. 3 for t rang-
ing from 50 fs to 500 fs. The detailed study of such Dalitz
plots could then give access to a more precise estimate
of the lifetime. Note that the present range of 50 fs to
500 fs is speciﬁc to the present fragmentation system. For
molecular dimers of diﬀerent internuclear/molecular dis-
tances and fragment ions of diﬀerent masses, this range
would be shifted. Another speciﬁcity of the molecular
system investigated here is the initial quasi-isotropic an-
gular distribution of the CO molecules within the dimer,
which prevents the use of information carried through
fragment angular correlations. With a well deﬁned ini-
tial orientation of the molecules, subrotational lifetimes
of the molecular ions could also be accessed more directly
using the so-called native frames approach, as recently
demonstrated for SO2+ ions resulting from SO3+
ions
fragmentation[14].

lation by solving the equation of motion of the ﬁrst step,
approximating the CO2+ molecular ion by a C+ ion and
a O+ ion linked by a 1.13 ˚A long rigid bound. Within this
approximation, the CO2+ rotation takes place in the ini-
tial plane containing both the center-of-mass of the CO+
ion and the axis of the (CO)2+ dication and is due to the
lower mass of the carbon compared to oxygen, leading to
a stronger acceleration of the carbon site.

As shown in Fig. 1.d, the concerted fragmentation and
the sequential fragmentation diﬀer by the ﬁnal KER dis-
tributions associated to each process. To reproduce in the
simulation the KER distribution expected for sequential
fragmentation events, a non purely Coulombic repulsion
between the C+ and O+ ions from the dissociating CO2+
dication is accounted for by a scaling of the repulsive
force [10]. This non Coulombic repulsion is directly in-
ferred from the experimental KER spectrum for sequen-
tial events.

The evolution of the mean kinetic energy of the CO+
molecular ion as a function of the time t during the ﬁrst
step is plotted in Fig. 2 for the sequential fragmentation.
The asymptotic energy of 3.2 eV corresponding to the
peak observed in Fig. 1.c is reached for t values ranging
from approximately 1 ps to 10 ps, which indicates that
sequential fragmentation events correspond to a fragmen-
tation time t larger than 1 ps. A clearer picture can be
obtained by looking at the simulations Dalitz plots shown
in Fig. 3. For τ <2 ps, one can clearly see the Dalitz dis-
tribution moving ﬁrst towards higher values of yD which
corresponds to higher transfer momentum to the CO+
ion. Then, it expands to the right (higher momentum
transfer to the O+ ion) due to the rotation of the CO2+
molecular ion. For lifetimes larger than 500 fs, the angle
θf reaches 270° and the left part of the Dalitz (higher
momentum transfer to the C+ ion) is also ﬁlled, forming
the quasi-horizontal band observed in the experimental

Identiﬁcation of the metastable states

As already described in a previous study on nitrogen
dimers (N2)2 [13], the total KER of the 3-body chan-
nels (sum of the kinetic energy of the three emitted frag-
ments) can be compared to the KER spectrum of the
dication dissociation from monomer targets by simply
accounting for the extra kinetic energy resulting from
the pure Coulomb repulsion with the neighbor molecular
ion. Such a comparison is provided in the upper panel
of Fig. 4 for (CO)2 dimers. For the 3-body dissociation
channel, assuming Re=4.2 ˚A and a pure Coulomb model,
the expected energy shift is ∆KER = 6.4 eV and agrees
perfectly with our measurement.

The global shape of the total KER spectrum (black
line) is quite similar to the KER distribution obtained
with the monomer CO target (orange line). Three peaks
at low energy are clearly visible for the dimer, although,
they are not as well resolved as for the monomer. This
larger width of the peaks can be explained by the ad-
ditional jitter in total KER due to the vibrational mo-
tion of the dimer bond. Following the identiﬁcation from
[15], the ﬁrst peak at 6.2 eV corresponds to the pop-

CO+ + C+ + O+ fragmentation channel (black line) and KER
spectrum of the CO2+ → C+ +O+ fragmentation of monomer

KER spectrum obtained for monomers is normalized to the
one obtained with dimers. Lower panel : contributions of

ulation of the 3Π, 1Σ+ and 1Π states, the second one
at 7.8 eV to the 3Σ+ state and the third one at 9.6 eV
has been assigned to the 21Σ+ state. Other high lying
states leading to a wide KER distribution between 17 eV
and 35 eV are also populated for both the dimer and
the monomer targets. Small diﬀerences can nevertheless
be observed between dimer and monomer targets when
looking closely at the relative population of the diﬀerent
molecular states. With dimer targets, KER higher than
17 eV are favored while lower KER values (correspond-
ing in particular to the 3Σ+ and 21Σ+ states) are disfa-
vored. As both collision systems are investigated simul-
taneously with the same setup and thus with the same
acceptance, this is a signature of a diﬀerence mainly re-
sulting from the primary collision process. The removal
of three electrons from the dimer target (two from one
of the CO molecule and one from its neighbor) requires
smaller impact parameters than the removal of two elec-
trons from a single CO molecule. In the case of dimer tar-
gets, this leads to a larger population of high excitation
states (from 17 eV to 35 eV) and to a smaller population

of the ground and low lying states corresponding to the
three peaks in KER lying between 10 eV and 17 eV).

It also clearly appears (lower panel of Fig. 4) that the
sequential fragmentation is only associated to the lower
energy part of the KER spectrum whereas concerted frag-
mentation occurs mainly for higher KER values.

For the events corresponding to a sequential fragmen-
tation, the dissociation of CO2+ occurs far enough from
the CO+ partner to be directly compared with the disso-
ciation of a CO2+ dication originating from a monomer.
For this purpose, the sum of the kinetic energy of the
C+ and O+ ions can be calculated in the frame of the
center-of-mass of the transient recoiling CO2+ molecular
ion. As the momentum of the CO2+ and CO+ are equal
but have opposite directions, the corresponding momen-
tum vectors in the recoiling center-of-mass frame are:

O+ = −→p O+ + mO

observable is only meaningful for sequential fragmenta-
tion events: if the CO2+ dissociation occurs too close to
the neighbor CO+ ion, the dissociation must be treated
as a real 3-body process. The peaks in KE* displayed
in Fig. 5 are now well resolved because the KE* spec-
trum does not depend on the initial dimer bond length
(asymptotic energy of the CO+ ion). Fig. 5 allows to con-
ﬁrm the previous identiﬁcation of the populated states.
The peaks respective mean positions are very close to
the ones obtained with the monomer target, but for the
3Σ+ and 21Σ+ states, they are clearly shifted by ∼0.1-
0.2 eV. Again, as both collision systems with dimer and
monomer targets are investigated simultaneously in a sin-
gle experiment and as we use the same analysis procedure
(with identical calibration), this shift cannot be imputed
to an experimental bias. Such a shift has been observed
in a previous work [9] and was attributed to the fact that
within the ﬁrst step of the fragmentation, when the van
der Waals bond is broken, a small part of the energy is
transferred to the CO2+ dication to populate higher vi-
brational states. The KER obtained for the monomer
indicates that for the 3Σ+ and 21Σ+ states, the lowest
vibrational level υ = 0 is dominantly populated. The
shift of ∼0.2 eV observed for these states when using
dimer targets can thereby be explained by a population
transfer due to the van der Waals bond break-up from the
υ = 0 levels towards the υ = 1 levels lying at respectively
0.26 eV and 0.29 eV higher energy.

In the present experiment, we identiﬁed the popula-
tion of molecular states of the CO2+ dication associated
to a sequencial fragmentation of the dimer target: the

manyfolds of the 3Π, 1Σ+ and 1Π states, and the υ = 0
and υ = 1 vibrational levels of the 3Σ+ and 21Σ+ states.
The analysis of the Dalitz plots of Fig. 3 for this sequen-
cial process have shown that all these molecular states
have lifetimes in the 2 ps-200 ns range, which is in agree-
ment with the previous measurements and calculations
provided in table I.

D. Fast dissociation channels

Concerted fragmentation occurs only for KER values
higher than 12 eV and spreading up to 35 eV (Fig. 4.b).
These KER values can be attributed to the population
of excited states of the CO2+ dication with dissociative
potential energy curves or with lifetimes shorter than
10 fs, leading to a quasi-simultaneous break-up of the
van der Waals and covalent bonds. The lower energy
part of the KER spectrum for concerted fragmentation
events overlaps with the 21Σ+ state manyfold identiﬁed
in the sequential selection. But the very fast dissociation
time observed for this concerted process implies that this
part of the KER distribution arises from diﬀerent initial
molecular electronic (or vibrational) states.

It is important to note that the large tail in KER be-
tween 17 eV and 35 eV is also observed in the KER spec-
trum obtained with monomer targets when accounting
for the 6.4 eV shift in KER (Fig. 4.a). This indicates
that such excited states leading to fast molecular dissoci-
ation are also populated in the collisions with monomer
targets. It is thus found in contradiction with the conclu-
sions of the former work of Ding et al. using short laser
pulse ionization [9]. In this previous study, the low lying
states 3Π, 1Σ+ and 1Π of CO2+ were dominantly pop-
ulated both for the dimer and monomer targets. When
compared to the KER obtained with monomer targets
the KE∗ distribution of the sequential fragmentation pro-
cess was found almost identical. However, the KER dis-
tribution obtained with dimers for the fast dissociation
process was found to be ∼1 eV higher than for the se-
quential fragmentation. This fast process was then inter-
preted as resulting from the presence of a neighbor CO+
ion in the dimer inducing a symmetry breaking of the
3Π state. Indeed, their calculations of potential energy
curves accounting for the presence of the neighbor CO+
ion revealed a fragmentation pathway involving both an
avoided crossing with the dissociative 3Σ− state and the
appearance of a new electronic state, leading to a ﬁnal
KER higher by 1.2 eV. They concluded that the fast dis-
sociation process was only enabled by the presence of
the neighbor ion and that this fast process should not be
expected with CO2+ dications from a monomer target.
The results obtained in our experiment are similar in
two aspects: we only observe sequential fragmentation
for KER values below 17 eV (3Π, 1Σ+ and 1Π states
of CO2+), and a higher KER distribution for concerted
dissociation than for sequential dissociation. However,
the KER spectrum of the present work for concerted

7

fragmentation is much wider (extending up to 35 eV)
with a maximum of the distribution peaking at 16.5 eV.
This KER distribution cannot be explained by the relax-
ation process invoked previously in [9]. First, the shift in
KER between the maxima of the distributions obtained
for concerted and sequential processes is close to 4 eV,
which is much higher than the value of 1.2 eV predicted
in [9]. Moreover, the tail between 17 eV and 35 eV ob-
tained for the concerted fragmentation is also observed
with monomer targets (Fig. 4.a) which demonstrates that
the process leading to such KER values is not due to the
presence of a neighbor ion. The higher KER values ob-
tained here must thus arise from the direct population of
high lying excited states leading to fast dissociation.

Several conclusions can be drawn from these observa-

tions.

Collisions with highly charged ions lead to the popu-
lation of higher excited states of the CO2+ dication than
with short laser pulses, both for dimer and monomer CO
targets. The population of highly excited states could
even be enhanced at higher collision energy, as previously
observed in [16].

While the 3Π, 1Σ+ and 1Π states of CO2+ show life-
times systematically larger than 2 ps, higher excited
states all lead to fast dissociation.

As such excited states were observed both with dimer
and monomer targets, this fast dissociation process is not
dependent on the presence of a neighbor ion, and fast
dissociation must also occur with monomer CO targets.
Finally, the present observations conﬁrm the conclu-
sions obtained in [13] for the study of the fragmentation
of (N2)2 dimers, showing no evidence for a signiﬁcant ef-
fect of the neighbor molecular ion beside the shift in KER
due to the Coulomb repulsion.

IV. CONCLUSION

Beyond providing information on the geometry of van
der Waals molecular clusters, COLTRIMS and CEI turn
up to be smart tools to probe the lifetimes of the molec-
ular states populated in collisions with highly charged
ions. For the 3-body fragmentation channel (CO)3+
2 →
CO+ + C+ + O+, about half of the events have been as-
signed to a sequential dissociation resulting from the pop-
ulation of metastable states of the CO2+ dication with
lifetimes between 2 ps and 200 ns. These states result in
low KER values and are associated to low excited states
of the dication, namely, the 3Π, 1Σ+ and 1Π states, and
the υ = 0 and υ = 1 vibrational levels of the 3Σ+ and
21Σ+ states. In a more general way, this experimental ap-
proach really opens new opportunities to get insights into
dication molecular states and their associated lifetimes.
The present technique would indeed be particularly well
suited for the study of metastable states with lifetimes
of the order of 100 fs, where a more precise lifetime es-
timate could be obtained. With dimer targets produced
with low rotational energy and with a well known initial

8

molecular orientation, this technique would also provide
access to the measurement of any subrotational lifetime
of molecular dications using the native frames represen-
tation, as recently performed in [14].

In the present work, the population of higher excited
states leading to a prompt dissociation and to a concerted
fragmentation of the dimer was also clearly evidenced.
The analysis of the KER distribution for this process
has shown that the fast dissociation cannot be explained
by the eﬀect of the neighbor molecular ion. Contrar-
ily, the similarity between the KER spectra obtained for
dimer and monomer targets indicates the population of

fast dissociating states in collisions with monomer tar-
gets. Altogether, this analysis shows a negligible eﬀect
of the neighbor molecular ion in the relaxation process of
the (CO)3+

system.
