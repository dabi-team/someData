We report successful implementation of the time-dependent second-order many-body perturbation theory
using optimized orthonormal orbital functions called time-dependent optimized second-order many-body per-
turbation theory [TD-OMP2] to reach out to relatively larger chemical systems for the study of intense-
laser-driven multielectron dynamics. We apply this method to strong-ﬁeld ionization and high-order har-
monic generation (HHG) of Ar. The calculation results are benchmarked against ab initio time-dependent
complete-active-space self-consistent ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF), time-dependent optimized coupled-cluster double
(TD-OCCD), and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) methods, as well as a single active electron (SAE)
model to explore the role of electron correlation.

INTRODUCTION

ﬁeld phenomena, the electron correlation is missing in
this approximation.

Laser-driven multielectron dynamics has become an
active area of research, thanks to the remarkable ad-
vance in laser technologies, which has made it possi-
ble to measure and control the electronic motion1–10.
Atoms and molecules interacting with laser pulses of in-
tensity (cid:38) 1014 W/cm2 in the visible to mid-infrared spec-
tral range, exhibit highly, even nonperturbatively nonlin-
ear response such as above-threshold ionization (ATI),
tunneling ionization, nonsequential double ionization
(NSDI), and high-order harmonic generation (HHG).
The HHG process is one of the key elements in the study
of light-matter interaction in the attosecond time-scale,
delivering ultrashort coherent light pulses in the extreme-
ultraviolet (XUV) to the soft x-ray regions, which carry
the information on the electronic structure and dynamics
of the generating medium.11 The HHG spectra are char-
acterized by a plateau where the intensity of the emitted
radiation remains nearly constant up to many orders, fol-
lowed by an abrupt cutoﬀ.

In principle, the multielectron dynamics and elec-
tron correlation12–15 are exactly described by the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE). However, di-
rect numerical integration of TDSE is not feasible for
systems with more than two electrons16–25. As a result,
single-active-electron (SAE) approximations has been
widely used26,27, in which only the outermost electron
is explicitly treated under the eﬀect of the other elec-
trons modeled by an eﬀective potential. Whereas SAE
has been useful in numerically exploring diﬀerent strong-

Among the most

reliable approaches

Therefore, various tractable ab initio methods have
actively been developed for
theoretical description
of correlated multielectron dynamics in intense laser
ﬁelds.
to
serve the purpose are the multiconﬁguration time-
dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) method28–32 and
self-consistent-
time-dependent
complete-active-space
ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF) method33,34.
In MCTDHF, the
electronic wavefunction is expressed in terms of
full
conﬁguration interaction (FCI) expansion, Ψ(t) =
(cid:80)
I CI (t)ΦI (t), where both CI coeﬃcients {CI (t)} and
occupied spin-orbitals {ψp(t)} constituting Slater deter-
minants {ΦI (t)} are propagated in time. The TD-
CASSCF method ﬂexibly classiﬁes occupied orbital space
into frozen-core (doubly occupied and ﬁxed in time),
dynamical-core (doubly occupied but propagated in time)
and active (fully correlated and propagated in time) sub-
spaces. Though accurate and powerful, the computa-
tional cost of the MCTDHF and TD-CASSCF methods
scales factorially with the number of correlated electrons.

such as

More approximate and thus less demanding meth-
ods
restricted-active-
time-dependent
space self-consistent ﬁeld (TD-RASSCF),35–37 and time-
dependent occupation-restricted multiple-active-space
(TD-ORMAS)38 have been developed by further ﬂexi-
bly classifying active orbital sub-space to target larger
chemical systems by limiting CI expansion of the wave-
function up to a manageable level. The TD-RASSCF
and TD-ORMAS methods achieve a polynomial,
in-
stead of factorial, cost scaling, and state-of-the-art real-
space implementations have turned out to be of great
utility.34,37,39,40 (See Ref. 12 for a review of ab initio
wavefunction-based methods for multielectron dynamics,
Ref. 41 and references therein for extension to correlated
electron-nuclear dynamics, and Ref. 42 for a perspec-

 
 
 
 
 
 
tive on multiconﬁguration approaches for indistinguish-
able particles.) Nevertheless, truncated-CI-based meth-
ods, even with time-dependent orbitals, have a general
drawback of not being size extensive.

To regain the size-extensivity at the same level of trun-
cation, we have recently derived and numerically im-
plemented a time-dependent optimized coupled-cluster
(TD-OCC) method43 using optimized orthonormal or-
bitals where both orbitals and amplitudes are time-
dependent. Our TD-OCC method is the time-dependent
formulation of the stationary orbital optimized coupled-
cluster method.44,45 We have implemented the TD-OCC
method with up to triple excitation amplitudes (TD-
OCCD and TD-OCCDT), and applied it to multielectron
dynamics in Ar induced by a strong laser pulse to obtain
a good agreement with the fully-correlated TD-CASSCF
method within the same active orbital space.
In ear-
lier work, Kvaal reported46 an orbital adaptive coupled-
cluster (OATDCC) method built upon the work of Ar-
ponen using biorthogonal orbitals;47 though, applica-
tions to laser-driven dynamics have not been addressed.
The polynomial scaling TD-OCC43 or the OATDCC46
method can reduce the computational cost to a large
extent in comparison to the general factorially scaling
MCTDHF methods.

As a cost-eﬀective approximation of the TD-OCCD
method, we have recently developed a method called
TD-OCEPA048 based on the simplest version of the
coupled-electron pair approximation,49–54 or equivalently
the linearized CCD approximation,55 popular in quan-
tum chemistry. The computational cost of the TD-
OCEPA0 method scales as N 6, with N being the number
of active orbitals. Although this is the same scaling as
that of the parent TD-OCCD method, TD-OCEPA0 is
much more eﬃcient than TD-OCCD due to the linearity
of amplitude equations and avoidance of a separate solu-
tion for the de-excitation amplitudes, resulting from the
Hermitian structure of the underlying Lagrangian.48

To enhance the applicability to even larger chemical
systems, we are looking for further approximate ver-
sions with a lower computational scaling in the TD-
OCC framework. The coupled-cluster method is intri-
cately connected with the many-body perturbation the-
ory. It allows one to obtain ﬁnite-order perturbation the-
ory energies and wavefunction from the coupled-cluster
equations.56 The computation of the second-order energy
requires the ﬁrst-order wavefunction, and only doubly ex-
cited determinants have contributions in the ﬁrst-order
correction to the reference wavefunction. Thus, second-
order many-body perturbation theory (MP2) can be seen
as an approximation to the coupled-cluster double (CCD)
method, having a lower N 5 scaling.

The MP2 method with optimized orbitals has been
developed by Bozkaya et al.57 for the stationary elec-
tronic structure calculations by minimization of the so-
called MP2-Λ functional. In earlier work, the optimiza-
tion of the MP2 energy was based on the minimization
of the Hylleraas functional with respect to the orbital

2

rotation.58,59 While both of these techniques provide
identical energy at the stationary point, the Λ functional-
based derivation has an advantage that it can be eas-
ily extended to higher-order many-body perturbation
theory.60

In this article, we propose time-dependent orbital
optimized second-order many-body perturbation theory
(TD-OMP2) as an approximation to the TD-OCCD
method, based on the time-dependent (quasi) variational
principle. The TD-OMP2 method inherits important fea-
tures of size extensivity and gauge invariance from TD-
OCC, with a reduced computational cost of O(N 5). As
a ﬁrst test case, we apply the TD-OMP2 method to elec-
tron dynamics in Ar atom irradiated by a strong laser
ﬁeld, and compare the results with those computed at
SAE, TDHF, TD-OCCD, and TD-CASSCF levels to un-
derstand where really TD-OMP2 stands in describing
the eﬀects of correlation in the laser-driven multielec-
tron dynamics. It should be emphasized that the present
TD-OMP2 method, albeit named after a perturbation
theory, can be applied to laser-induced, nonperturbative
electron dynamics, since the laser-electron interaction is
fully (nonperturbatively) included in the zeroth-order de-
scription with time-dependent orbitals.

This paper is organized as follows. Our formulation of
the TD-OMP2 method is presented in Sec. II. Numerical
applications are described and discussed in Sec. III. The
concluding remarks are given in Sec. IV. Hartree atomic
units are used unless otherwise stated, and Einstein con-
vention is implied throughout for summation over orbital
indices.

the total wavefunction. The occupied spin-orbitals are
classiﬁed into ncore core spin-orbitals which are occupied
in the reference Φ and kept uncorrelated, and nact =
nocc − ncore active spin-orbitals (t, u, v, w) among which
the Nact = Ne −ncore active electrons are correlated. The
active spin-orbitals are further split into those in the hole
space (i, j, k, l) and the particle space (a, b, c, d), which are
deﬁned as those occupied and unoccupied, respectively,
in the reference Φ. The core spin-orbitals can further be
split into frozen-core space (i(cid:48)(cid:48), j(cid:48)(cid:48)) and the dynamical-
core space (i(cid:48), j(cid:48)). The frozen-core orbitals are ﬁxed in
time, whereas dynamical core orbitals are propagated in
time.33 (See Fig. 1 of Ref. 43 for a pictorial illustration
of the orbital subspacing.)

A. Review of TD-OCCD

The stationary MP2 method can be considered as an
approximation of the CCD method, where the full CCD
energy functional,

E = (cid:104)Φ|(1 + ˆΛ2)e− ˆT2 ˆHe ˆT2|Φ(cid:105)

(7)

is approximated by retaining the terms giving the second-
order correction to the reference energy E0 = (cid:104)Φ| ˆH|Φ(cid:105).
Here, ˆT2 = τ ab

ing the excitation and de-excitation amplitudes, respec-
tively. Therefore, we start with the time-dependent CCD
Lagrangian of the following form,

L(t) = (cid:104)Φ|(1 + ˆΛ2)e− ˆT2( ˆH − i∂t)e ˆT2 |Φ(cid:105),
which is a natural time-dependent extension of the energy
functional, Eq. (7). Following Ref. 43, we consider the
real-valued action functional,

B. Derivation of TD-OMP2 as an approximation to
TD-OCCD

Now we derive the TD-OMP2 method as an approx-
imation to the TD-OCCD method, based on the parti-
tioning of the electronic Hamiltonian,
ˆH = ˆH (0) + ˆH (1),

(18a)

into the zeroth-order part ˆH (0) = ˆf = f p

q and the

qj + (Vext)p
q,
ν are the matrix elements of ˆh0

(18b)

where (h0)µ
and ˆVext, respectively.

ν and (Vexe)µ

Based on this partitioning, we apply the Baker-
Campbell-Hausdorﬀ expansion to TD-OCCD Lagrangian
of Eq. (8), and retain those terms up to quadratic in v,
τ , and λ (thus, contributing to ﬁrst- and second-order
corrections to Lagrangian) to obtain

ij

ab = τ ab∗

In summary, the TD-OMP2 method is deﬁned by the
EOMs of double excitation amplitudes τ ab
ij [Eq. (20)], the
relation λij
, and the EOMs of orbitals [Eqs. (12)
and (13)] with 1RDM and 2RDM elements given by
Eqs. (23)-(26). The orbital time-derivative terms −iX
can be dropped from Eq. (22), if one makes an arbitrary
choice of (cid:104)ψi| ˙ψj(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψa| ˙ψb(cid:105) = 0 for the redundant or-
bital rotations. It should be noted that (i) our partition-
ing scheme [Eqs. (18)] is consistent with the standard
Møller-Plesset perturbation theory in the absence of the
external ﬁeld Vext, and (ii) in case with Vext, the zeroth-
order Hamiltonian is time dependent, both through the
change of orbitals and an explicit time dependence of
Vext(t), the latter implying nonperturbative inclusion of
the laser-electron interaction.

C. Alternative derivation

Another, more perturbation theoretic derivation be-

L = L0 − iλij

ab ˙τ ab

ij + (cid:104)Φ|ˆΛ2( ˆH − i ˆX)|Φ(cid:105)

(19)

gins with the following Lagrangian,

where L0 = (cid:104)Φ|( ˆH −i ˆX)|Φ(cid:105) is the reference contribution.
Inserting this TD-OMP2 Lagrangian into Eq. (9) and
making it stationary with respect to amplitude variations
derives TD-OMP2 amplitude equations,

where p(µν) is the cyclic permutation operator. Impor-
tantly, Eqs. (20) and (21) reveals that the EOM for λij
ab
is just complex conjugate of that for τ ab
ij , resulting in
λij
ab = τ ab∗
. Therefore, we do not need a separate solu-
tion for the Λ2 amplitudes.

We also make the action stationary with respect to
the orthonormality-conserving orbital variation to derive
formally the same orbital EOMs as Eqs. (12) and (13),
with one-particle reduced density matrices (1RDM) and
two-particle reduced density matrices (2RDM) given ex-
plicitly as

time-dependent variational principle based on the action
of Eq. (9), to obtain identical method as derived in the
previous section. Two expressions of the TD-OMP2 La-
grangian, Eqs. (19) and (27), take the same numerical
value as a function of time when evaluated with the so-
lution of TD-OMP2, {τ ab
ij (t), ψp(t)}. The Lagrangian of
Eq. (27) can be viewed as the time-dependent extension
of the Hylleraas energy functional used in conventional,
time-independent OMP2 method.58,59

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Ground-state energy of BH

To assess the performance of the method described
in the previous section, we do a series of the ground-
state energy calculations taking BH molecule as an exam-
ple with double-ζ plus polarization (DZP) basis.63 The
imaginary time relaxation method43 is used to obtain
the ground state. We have started our calculations with
the bond length of 1.8 a.u. and gradually increased to

The values for both the MP2 and OMP2 are reported
in Table I. The required matrix elements are obtained
from the Gaussian09 program62 package and interfaced
with our numerical code. All the values are compared
with the values from the PSI4 program package.61 We
obtained identical results for the reported values except
in ﬁve cases, even for which the diﬀerence appears only
at the eighth or ninth digit after the decimal point. In
these calculations, the number of orbitals N are taken to
be the same as the number of basis nbas to make a com-
parison with PSI4,61 and all the orbitals are treated as
active. However, our implementation allows to optimize
orbitals with N ≤ nbas in general, with a ﬂexible clas-
siﬁcation of the occupied orbital space into frozen core,
dynamical core, and active.

We present numerical applications of the present
method to Ar subject to an intense laser pulse linearly
polarized in the z direction. Calculations for intense long-
wavelength laser ﬁelds are computationally demanding,
thus serving as a good test for the newly implemented
methods. The laser-electron interaction is introduced to
the one-body part of the electronic Hamiltonian within
the dipole approximation in the velocity gauge,

we obtain faster convergence with the velocity gauge for
the case of intense long-wavelength laser pulses34,40.

We have considered three diﬀerent intensities of 1, 2, and
4 ×1014 W/cm2 for Ar.

The spherical ﬁnite-element discrete variable represen-
tation (FEDVR) basis34,40 is used in our implementation.
The convergence with respect to the maximum angular
momentum lmax is checked at the TDHF level, and lmax
is set to 72. The radial coordinate r is discretized by
FEDVR consisting of 78 ﬁnite elements with 23 DVR
functions each, to support 0 < r < Rmax = 300. A
cos 1
4 mask function is switched on at 240 to avoid re-
ﬂection from the boundary. Fourth-order exponential
Runge-Kutta integrator64 is used to propagate equations
of motions with 20000 time steps per optical cycle. The
simulations are continued after the end of pulse for fur-
ther 6000 time steps.

For ab initio TDHF, TD-OMP2, TD-OCCD, and TD-
CASSCF methods, the 1s2s2p core is kept frozen, and
the dynamics of remaining eight electrons are actively
taken into account with four (TDHF) or thirteen (TD-
OMP2, TD-OCCD, and TD-CASSCF) active orbitals.
The SAE method ﬁrst diagonalizes the following eﬀective
Hamiltonian65,66

with A = 5.4 and B = 3.682 for Ar66. This potential
correctly supports 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p bound orbitals,
with the 3p orbital energy of -15.82 eV with the present
FEDVR basis. After obtaining the ground state, we solve
the eﬀective one-electron Schr¨odinger equation,

χ(t) orthonormal to the inner shell orbitals.

In Fig. 1, we plot the time evolution of the sign-ﬂipped
dipole moment (cid:104)z(cid:105) evaluated as a trace (cid:104)z(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψp|ˆz|ψq(cid:105)ρq

for ab initio methods and (cid:104)z(cid:105) = (cid:104)χ|z|χ(cid:105) for SAE. We
compare the TD-OMP2 results with SAE, TDHF, TD-
OCCD, and TD-CASSCF ones. Within the same ac-
tive space, TD-CASSCF produces highly accurate re-
sults, useful for performance analysis of the TD-OMP2
method.

The lowest (1.0 × 1014 W/cm2) and highest (4.0 × 1014
W/cm2) intensity cases characterize the dynamics with
small and substantial amount of ionization, respectively
(Fig. 2 below). The SAE approximation is known26,27,65
to work better for the latter case, where the dynamics
is dominated by tunneling ionization of the single, most
weakly bound electron (one of the 3p0 electrons in the
present case). It is not well suited for describing the for-
mer case dominated by collective bound dynamics. On
the other hand, TDHF serves as the reference multielec-
tron method without the (Coulomb) correlation by deﬁ-
nition, and provides a qualitatively correct description of
the bound dynamics. It, however, fails to accurately de-
scribe cases with sizable tunneling ionization. (See, e.g,
Ref. 67 and references therein.) These trends of SAE
and TDHF methods are well conﬁrmed in the perfor-
mance comparison to the reference TD-CASSCF method
in Figs. 1 and 2.

(b), TD-OMP2 (c), and TD-OCCD (d) methods with that of
TD-CASSCF.

As seen in Fig. 1-(a), at the lowest intensity of
1014 W/cm2 all the methods except for SAE produce sim-
ilar results. The TD-OCCD produces virtually the iden-
tical result with the TD-CASSCF, whereas TD-OMP2
slightly overestimates, and TDHF underestimates, con-
sidering TD-CASSCF as the benchmark. With increase
in intensity, the diﬀerence among the methods become
more prominent. While all the methods except for SAE
give similar results in the early stage, TD-OMP2 and
TDHF start to overestimate and underestimate, respec-
tively, with the progress of tunneling ionization (Fig. 2).
In general, the performance of the TD-OMP2 method is
better than TDHF and SAE due to consideration at least
a part of the electron correlation. It is noticed that the
TD-OMP2 dipole moment agrees better with the TD-
CASSCF one for the highest intensity [Fig. 1-(c)] than
for the intermediate one [Fig. 1-(b)], which might indi-
cate that the latter case, with both sizable ionization and

nontrivial correlation eﬀects coexisting, is theoretically
more challenging.

The general trends in Fig. 1 are also found in the single
ionization probability (Fig. 2), evaluated as the proba-
bility of ﬁnding an electron outside a sphere of 20 a.u. ra-
dius. Again, we see a systematic overestimation by TD-
OMP2 and underestimation by TDHF in comparison to
the TD-CASSCF result; the performance of TD-OMP2 is
better than that of TDHF and SAE, except for the high-
est intensity case, where the SAE result is as accurate as
the TD-OCCD one.

In Figs. 3–5 we compare HHG spectra, calculated as
the modulus squared of the Fourier transform of the
expectation value of the dipole acceleration, which, in
turn, is obtained with a modiﬁed Ehrenfest expression34.
All ab initio methods reproduce the HHG spectra rela-
tively well, including an experimentally observed char-

amplitude by TD-OMP2 and underestimation by TDHF
compared to the TD-CASSCF result as in the case for
the longer wavelength. It is encouraging, however, that
the TD-OMP2 result is much closer to the TD-CASSCF
one for the shorter wavelength, which is more sensitive
to the treatment of correlation eﬀects.

It is worth noting that, for an intensity as high as
4 × 1014 W/cm2, the TD-OMP2 simulation completed
stably. This should be the direct consequence of full
inclusion of the laser-electron interaction in the zeroth-
order Hamiltonian and the orbital optimization (propa-
gation) according to the time-dependent variational prin-
ciple based on the total (up to second-order) Lagrangian,
which keeps the instantaneous perturbation ˆH (1) = ˆH − ˆf
relatively small in the present simulation.

Finally, the computational cost of diﬀerent parts of
TD-OMP2 and TD-OCCD methods are compared in
Table II for the same computational condition as in
Fig. 3 (c). The evaluation of T2 equation, Λ2 equation,
and 2RDM all scale as N 6 for the TD-OCCD method.
On the other hand, for the TD-OMP2 method, the eval-
uation of T2 equation scales as N 5, and we do not need a
separate solution for Λ2, as it is just the complex conju-
gate of T2. The greatest time saving for the TD-OMP2
method comes from the evaluation of 2RDM since it
scales as N 4, and does not involve any operator products.
Overall, TD-OMP2 achieves a signiﬁcant cost reduction
compared to TD-OCCD, making it an attractive choice
for simulations involving larger chemical systems.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have successfully implemented the TD-OMP2
method for the real-time simulations of laser-induced dy-
namics in relatively large chemical systems. The TD-
OMP2 method retains the size-extensivity and gauge-
invariance of TD-OCC, and is computationally much
more eﬃcient than the full TD-OCCD method. As a
ﬁrst numerical test, we have applied the method to the
ground state of BH and the laser-driven dynamics of Ar.
The imaginary time relaxation for BH obtains the iden-
tical ground-state energies with those by the stationary
theory, which indicates the correctness of the implemen-
tation. The performance of the present method is numer-
ically investigated in comparison to SAE, TDHF, TD-
OCCD, and TD-CASSCF methods for the case of laser-
driven Ar. The results suggest a decent performance
with a consistent overestimation of the correlation ef-
fect in such highly nonlinear phenomena. Remarkably,
the TD-OMP2 method is stable and does not breakdown
even in the presence of strong laser-electron interaction,
thanks to the nonperturbative inclusion of external ﬁelds
and time-dependent orbital optimization. Further assess-
ment of the TD-OMP2 method for diﬀerent systems and
severer simulation conditions (e.g, with higher-intensity
and/or longer-wavelength lasers) will be reported else-
where.

acteristic dip around the 52nd order (∼ 54 eV) at 2×
and 4 × 1014 W/cm2 related to the Cooper minimum
of the photoionization spectrum68 at the same energy.
However, TDHF systematically underestimates and fails
to reproduce ﬁne details. The SAE method severely
underestimates the HHG yields, although the overall
shape of the HHG spectrum is well reproduced, and an
intensity-dependent scaling brings the spectral intensity
at the higher plateau close to that of TD-CASSCF, espe-
cially for the highest intensity. The agreement with the
TD-CASSCF results is much better for the TD-OCCD
method, which contains nonlinear terms in the amplitude
equations, then followed by TD-OMP2 with slight over-
estimation. This trend is consistent with the capability
of each method to treat the electron correlation.

In order to investigate the performance of TD-OMP2
method for shorter wavelengths, where electrons not only
in the highest-occupied but also in the inner-shell orbitals
are driven by the laser, we consider a shorter wavelength
of 200 nm with an intensity of 4×1014 W/cm2. All the
other simulation parameters are identical to those given
above. The obtained time evolution of the dipole moment
(Fig. 6) shows a slight overestimation of the oscillation
