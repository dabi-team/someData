News on spectra from the NA61/SHINE experiment

Magdalena Kuich∗† for the NA61/SHINE Collaboration
University of Warsaw
E-mail: magdalena.kuich@cern.ch

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron. The main
goals of the experiment are to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter and study
the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement. In order to reach these goals, a study of hadron
production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and proton-nucleus inter-
actions as a function of collision energy and size of the colliding nuclei.
In this talk, recent
results on particle production in p+p interactions, as well as Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions in the
SPS energy range are reviewed. Transverse momentum, transverse mass and rapidity spectra ob-
tained with various analysis methods are presented. Surprises in studies of signatures of onset of
deconﬁnement are discussed. The results are compared with available world data.

1. Introduction

The NA61/SHINE experiment performs a unique two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram
of strongly interacting matter. The main goals are the study of the properties of the onset of decon-
ﬁnement by measurements of hadron production and the search for the critical point of strongly in-
teracting matter by measuring event-by-event ﬂuctuations. Measurements are performed at CERN
SPS beam momenta (13A-150/158A GeV/c) for various system sizes (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc,
Xe+La and Pb+Pb). The programme is motivated by the discovery of the onset of deconﬁnement
in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c by the NA49 experiment [1, 2].

2. NA61/SHINE experiment

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN SPS [3]. The detection system is based
on eight Time Projection Chambers (TPC) providing acceptance in the full forward center-of-mass
hemisphere, down to pT = 0. TPCs allow for track, momentum and charge reconstruction as well
as mean energy loss (dE/dx) measurement per unit path length. Time of Flight walls provide addi-
tional particle identiﬁcation measuring particles mass in smaller acceptance regions. A zero-degree
calorimeter, Projectile Spectator Detector, allows to select central collisions based on the measure-
ment of the forward energy mostly contributed by projectile spectator nucleons and fragments.

3. Recent results on study of the onset of deconﬁnement

3.1 Negatively charged pion spectra

The negatively charged pion spectra in p+p [4], central Be+Be [5, 6] and central Ar+Sc colli-
sions [7, 8, 9] were derived in large acceptance from unidentiﬁed negatively charged hadron spectra
using the so-called h− method. The method is based on the fact that the majority of negatively
charged particles produced in p+p and ion+ion collisions are pions. The small non-pion contribu-
tion is subtracted from the spectra based on estimates obtained with the EPOS 1.99 model. Figure

Ref. [8]). Transverse mass spectra at mid-rapidity at 40A GeV/c in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc inter-
actions are shown in Fig. 1 (right) along with Pb+Pb (NA49) [2] results for comparison. The mT
spectra are exponential in p+p interactions, but deviate from this shape for heavier systems. Nev-
ertheless, exponential functions were ﬁtted in bins of rapidity to all systems in the mT − mπ range
0.2-0.7 GeV in order to extrapolate to the unmeasured region. Mean multiplicities of all pions
((cid:104)π(cid:105)) normalised to the average number of wounded nucleons ((cid:104)W (cid:105)) are shown in Fig. 2. Results
are compared with results from other experiments [10, 11, 12]. At higher SPS energies the rate
of increase with collision energy is larger for the heavy systems (Pb+Pb, Ar+Sc) than for the light
ones (p+p, Be+Be). The Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) predicts such an increase in
the quark-gluon plasma due to the larger number of degrees of freedom [13] compared to a hadron
gas.

tion.

3.2 Charged hadron spectra

Charged hadrons (π ±, p, p and K±) in p+p interactions and K± near mid-rapidity from central
Be+Be collisions were identiﬁed based on the measurements of the energy loss in the TPCs (dE/dx)
and time of ﬂight in the ToF detectors. Figure 3 presents the energy dependence of the inverse slope
parameter of mT spectra of charged kaons. Figure 4 shows the multiplicity ratio of charged kaons to
pions at mid-rapidity. In both ﬁgures NA61/SHINE results from p+p interactions [14] and Be+Be
collisions are compared with results from central Pb+Pb collisions from NA49 [1, 2] and other
experiments [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

A plateau visible in the energy dependence of the inverse slope parameter in Fig. 3 and
peaks seen in Fig. 4 for Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions in the SPS energy range were predicted
by the SMES model as signatures of the onset of deconﬁnement. In the SPS energy range the
NA61/SHINE results on p+p interactions exhibit a qualitatively similar energy dependence (step)
for the inverse splope parameter and a step instead of a peak in the kaon to pion ratio. Thus some
properties of hadron production previously attributed to the onset of deconﬁnement in heavy ion
collisions are present also in p+p interactions. Surprisingly, while the inverse slope parameter in
Be+Be collisions lies slightly above the one in p+p interactions, the values of the charged kaon
to pion ratio are very close in Be+Be and p+p. Figure 5 presents the system size dependence of
the positively charged kaon to pion yield ratio at mid-rapidity at 30A (left) and 150A (right) GeV/c
beam momentum. A clear jump between light systems (p+p and Be+Be) and a heavy system
(Pb+Pb) suggests a threshold behaviour of quark-gluon plasma production in system size.

3.3 Λ hyperon spectra

NA61/SHINE measured two-dimensional (rapidity versus transverse momentum) sectra of Λ
hyperons in p+p interactions at 40 [23] and 158 GeV/c [24]. Figure 6 (left) presents the energy
dependence of the total Λ yield compared with world results from p+p interactions and EPOS 1.99
model predictions. The right panel of Fig. 6 shows the energy dependence of the ratio of total Λ
to π multiplicity, compared with other results for p+p and heavy ion collisions. The ratio shows a
maximum in the SPS energy range for heavy ions, which is similar to the maximum visible in the
ratio of total K to π multiplicities (see right panel of Fig. 4). In contrast to Pb+Pb the Λ/π ratio in
p+p interactions reaches a plateau at the SPS energies.

3.4 φ meson spectra

NA61/SHINE also performs measurements of yields of heavier mesons. Figure 7 presents the
energy dependence of φ meson production. The mean φ multiplicity is plotted in Fig. 7 (left) and
compared to various model predictions. The best agreement with the data is given by the EPOS
1.99 model, however, the predicted energy dependence seems to be too steep. Figure 7 (right)
shows the energy dependence of mid-rapidity yields which are well described by the EPOS 1.99
and Pythia 6 models.

4. Summary

This contribution focused on recent results from the NA61/SHINE strong interactions program
aiming to study the onset of deconﬁnement. Results on spectra were presented, in particular the
new charged kaon spectra in Be+Be collisions at 30A–150A GeV/c. The inverse slope parameter of
the transverse mass distribution of charged kaons is higher in Be+Be than in p+p interactions, while
the charged kaon to pion multiplicity ratio is at a similar level much below that seen in Pb+Pb colli-
sions. This raises questions about the mechanism of onset of deconﬁnement as a function of system
size. Moreover, new φ production measurements in p+p interactions at 40, 80 and 158 GeV/c beam
momenta were reported. The two-dimensional scan of particle production at SPS energies with size
of the collision system will be completed in 2018. As an extension of this program NA61/SHINE
plans to measure precisely open charm and multi-strange hyperon production in 2021–2024.
