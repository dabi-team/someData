ABSTRACT
We study the neutrino-induced production of nuclides in explosive supernova nucleosynthesis for progenitor
stars with solar metallicity including neutrino nucleus reactions for all nuclei with charge numbers Z < 76 with
average neutrino energies in agreement with modern Supernova simulations. Considering progenitors with
initial main sequence masses between 13 M(cid:12) and 30 M(cid:12), we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant production of 11B, 138La, and
180Ta by neutrino nucleosynthesis, despite the signiﬁcantly reduced neutrino energies. The production of 19F
turns out to be more sensitive to the progenitor mass and structure than to the ν process. With our complete set
of cross sections we have identiﬁed eﬀects of the ν process on several stable nuclei including 33S, 40Ar, 41K,
59Co, and 113In at the 10% level. Neutrino-induced reactions contribute to a similar extent to the production
of radioactive 26Al and increase the yield of 22Na by 50%. Future γ ray astronomy missions may reach the
precision at which the contribution from the ν process becomes relevant. We ﬁnd that the production of 22Na
by the ν process could explain the Ne-E(L) component of meteoritic graphite grains. The ν process enhances
the yield of 36Cl and we point out that the resulting 36Cl/35Cl ratio is in agreement with the values infrerred
for the early solar system. Our extended set of neutrino-nucleus interactions also allows us to exclude any
further eﬀects of the ν process on stable nuclei and to quantify the eﬀects on numerous, hitherto unconsidered
radioactive nuclei, e.g., 36Cl, 72As, 84Rb, and 88Y.

1. INTRODUCTION
Astrophysical objects like stars, novae, or supernovae are
the origin of most of the elements in the Universe (Burbidge
et al. 1957; Cameron 1957). Whereas the likely nucleosyn-
thesis processes associated with these objects have been iden-
tiﬁed and a general understanding has been developed, many
details of their operation are still unresolved (Wiescher et al.
2012; Thielemann et al. 2011; Arnould & Takahashi 1999).
This is due to limited computational capabilities to simulate
astrophysical objects and the full range of their varieties and
to the fact that the properties of the nuclides involved in the
nucleosynthesis processes are not known experimentally and
have to be modeled (Grawe et al. 2007; Langanke & Schatz
2013).

An important test for models that aim to describe how the
elements are formed is the reproduction the chemical com-
position of well-known objects like the Solar System. The
composition of the Solar System has been determined with
high accuracy (Lodders 2003; Asplund et al. 2009) but we still
lack the full understanding of the origin of all the isotopes that
can be observed since it likely involves contributions from a
multitude of events that are diﬃcult to disentangle. Primi-
tive meteorites are another source of information on the nu-
cleosynthesis that has contributed to the composition of our
solar system. Isotopic anomalies have allowed to prescribe
pre-solar grains that reﬂect the composition of the early solar
system (ESS) to diﬀerent astrophysical scenarios. The pres-
ence of 44Ti and an excess of Si as well as the isotopic ratios of
Fe and Ni in SiC-X grains and graphite grains have led to the
conclusion that these grains originate from a core-collapse su-
pernova (Amari et al. 1992). Detections of gamma-rays from
radioactive nuclei by space bound observatories like INTE-

GRAL (Winkler et al. 2011) are another invaluable tool to
determine sites of active nucleosynthesis and thereby advance
our understanding of astrophysical nucleosynthesis. Such de-
tection allows for a snapshot view of the ongoing nucleosyn-
thesis in our galaxy and, provided a suited nuclear half-life,
to relate the origin of the nuclide to a speciﬁc astrophysical
source (Diehl et al. 2006).
In cases where the observation
can be assigned to a particular supernova remnant, one can
learn about asymmetries in the explosion (Grefenstette et al.
2014; Wongwathanarat et al. 2017). The prime nuclide for
gamma-ray astronomy in recent years has been 26Al (Diehl
2013).
Its production has been associated with several as-
trophysical sources (see Woosley et al. 1990, and references
therein), however, in recent years evidence has been brought
forward (Timmes et al. 1995; Diehl & Timmes 1998; Diehl
2013) that massive stars can account for most of the 26Al in
the galaxy. Other gamma-ray astronomy candidates such as
22Na, 44Ti, and 60Fe are also related to core-collapse super-
novae (Iyudin et al. 1994; Timmes et al. 1995; Woosley et al.
2002; Rauscher et al. 2002; Limongi & Chieﬃ 2006).

It has long been recognized that neutrino-nucleus reactions
are essential for the synthesis of selected nuclides including
7Li, 11B, 15N, 19F, 138La, and 180Ta (Woosley et al. 1990;
Heger et al. 2005) or can contribute to the production of long-
lived radioactive nuclides (Woosley et al. 1990; Timmes et al.
1995; Woosley et al. 2002; Rauscher et al. 2002). This is de-
noted as ν process and involves neutrinos of all ﬂavors, which
emitted from the hot proto-neutron star (PNS) formed after a
supernova explosion, interact with nuclei as they pass through
the surrounding stellar matter. At the same time, these outer
layers are heated up and compressed by the explosion shock-
wave propagating outward from the PNS and causing the ejec-

tion of the material. Neutral-current reactions excite the nu-
cleus to states above particle thresholds so that the subsequent
decay is accompanied by emission of light particles (proton,
neutron, or α particle). Due to the relatively low energies of
the neutrinos, charged-current reactions can only be induced
by electron-type neutrinos. This process can be accompanied
by light-particle emission if the (νe, e−) or (¯νe, e+) reactions
excite the daughter nucleus to levels above particle thresholds.
Hence there are two possible ways for the ν process to con-
tribute to nucleosynthesis. Firstly, rare nuclei, e.g., 11B, 19F,
138La, and 180Ta, can be produced directly as daughter prod-
ucts of neutrino-induced reactions on abundant nuclei. And
secondly, neutrino spallation reactions increase the amount of
light particles required to synthesize some nuclides such as
7Li and 26Al within a network of charged-particle reactions.

The focus of this article is to review the ν process in
the light of an improved understanding of neutrino proper-
ties in core-collapse supernovae and with an improved set
of neutrino-nucleus cross sections covering all nuclei in the
reaction network to explore in particular the impact of the
ν process on the production of long-lived radioactive nuclei
of interest to gamma-ray astronomy. Previous investigations
of nucleosynthesis by neutrino-induced reactions have been
based on stellar simulations using various hydrodynamical
models (Woosley et al. 1990; Heger et al. 2005; Limongi &
Chieﬃ 2006) and neutrino-nucleus cross section data which
were restricted to a set of key nuclei, especially those which
are quite abundant in outer burning shells, and to a lim-
ited number of decay channels. Furthermore, the simula-
tions adopted supernova neutrino energy spectra, described
by Fermi-Dirac distributions with chemical potential µ = 0
and temperature Tν, which were appropriate at the time the
= 4-5 MeV for
studies were performed. They used Tνe,¯νe
electron (anti)neutrinos, corresponding to average energies,
(cid:104)Eν(cid:105) = 3.15 Tν, between 12 MeV and 16 MeV (Woosley et al.
= 5-10 MeV (Woosley et al.
1990; Heger et al. 2005) and Tνµ,τ
1990; Timmes et al. 1995; Heger et al. 2005) for muon and tau
neutrinos as well as for the corresponding anti-neutrinos, cor-
responding to average energies between 16 MeV and 32 MeV.
We improve these simulations in two relevant aspects.
Firstly, we have derived a complete set of partial diﬀeren-
tial cross sections for neutrino-induced charged- and neutral-
current reactions for nuclei with charge numbers Z < 76
considering various single- and multi-particle decay chan-
nels. For several key reactions, we have derived the cross
sections either directly from experimental data or from shell
model calculations which is the most accurate theoretical tool
to describe low-energy neutrino-nucleus reactions (Langanke
& Mart´ınez-Pinedo 2003; Balasi et al. 2015). The relevant
cross sections are provided in the supplemental material. Sec-
ondly, the more realistic treatment of neutrino transport in
recent supernova simulations (Fischer et al. 2010; H¨udepohl
et al. 2010; Mart´ınez-Pinedo et al. 2012; Mart´ınez-Pinedo
et al. 2014; Mirizzi et al. 2016) yield spectra for all neu-
trino families which are noticeably shifted to lower energies.
This reduces the neutrino-nucleus cross sections and in par-
ticular particle spallation cross sections for neutral-current re-
actions which are very sensitive to the tail of the neutrino
spectra due to the relatively high particle separation thresh-
olds involved. Our choice of neutrino temperatures denoted
=
“low energies” is Tνe
4 MeV ((cid:104)E ¯νe,νµ,τ (cid:105) = 12 MeV), in agreement with recent sim-
ulations (H¨udepohl et al. 2010; Mart´ınez-Pinedo et al. 2012;

= 2.8 MeV ((cid:104)Eνe (cid:105) = 9 MeV), T¯νe,νµ,τ

Mart´ınez-Pinedo et al. 2014; Mirizzi et al. 2016). To compare
with previous neutrino nucleosynthesis studies (Woosley et al.
1990; Heger et al. 2005) we have also performed our calcula-
=
tions using the following set of neutrino temperatures: Tνe
4 MeV ((cid:104)Eνe (cid:105) = 12 MeV), T¯νe
= 5 MeV ((cid:104)E ¯νe (cid:105) = 15.8 MeV),
= 6.0 MeV ((cid:104)Eνµ,τ (cid:105) = 19 MeV); that we denote as
and Tνµ,τ
“high energies” along the manuscript.

The paper is organized as follows: In §2 we discuss our cal-
culations of neutrino-nucleus reactions with a particular focus
on the cases for which experimental data are available. After
a brief description of the supernova model in §3, we discuss
our results for the stable nuclei in §4 and then the impact on
radioactive nuclei in §5. Finally, we conclude in §6.

2. NEUTRINO-NUCLEUS CROSS SECTIONS
We have calculated partial diﬀerential neutrino-nucleus
cross sections globally for nuclei with Z < 76 based on a
two-step strategy (Kolbe et al. 1992): i) the neutrino-induced
nuclear excitation cross sections to a ﬁnal state at energy E
have been calculated within the Random Phase Approxima-
tion following Kolbe et al. (2003) and considering multipole
transitions up to order four. The single particle energies were
adopted from an appropriate Woods-Saxon parametrization,
adjusted to reproduce the proton and neutron thresholds and
to account for the energies of the Isobaric Analog State and
ii) The decay probabilities of
the leading giant resonances.
the excited nuclear levels have been derived within the sta-
tistical model. At low excitation energies we use the Modi-
ﬁed Smoker code (Loens 2010) which considers experimen-
tally known states and their properties explicitly and then
matches the experimental spectrum to a level density. The
code is restricted to treat single-particle decays. To allow for
multi-particle decay, which becomes relevant at modest ex-
citation energies or in nuclei with large neutron excess and
hence small separation energies, we have adopted the ABLA
code (Keli´c et al. 2009) at higher excitation energies, which
has been validated to properly describe multi-particle decays
and ﬁssion. The results of the two statistical model codes
have been smoothly matched at moderate energies above the
single-particle thresholds.

Using cross sections for neutrino nucleus reactions based
on Random Phase Approximation (RPA) is justiﬁed by the
relatively high energy of incoming neutrinos that are large
compared to the energy scale of nuclear excitations. In this
case collective excitations dominate and in RPA the centroid
of the strength of collective excitations are reproduced quite
reliably without the need of a precise reproduction of the de-
tailed fragmentation.

A particular relevant nucleus for gamma-ray astronomy
is 26Al that is produced in the ν process by the reaction
26Mg(νe, e−)26Al and will be discussed in detail in §5. This
reaction has been considered previously by Domogatskii &
Nadezhin (1980) where the cross section was estimated con-
sidering the Fermi contribution to the isobaric analog state
and Gamow-Teller transitions from the β+ decay of 26Si, the
mirror nucleus to 26Mg. Zegers et al. (2006) have extracted
the B(GT) strength distribution based on 26Mg(3He, t) charge
exchange reactions with high resolution. This has the advan-
tage of not having the energy limitations of beta-decay and
allows to determine transitions to all relevant states in 26Al.
Based on these data and the known Fermi transition to the
isobaric analog state we have calculated the cross sections for
26Mg(νe, e−)26Al. In order to account for additional contribu-

tion (Brown & Richter 2006) with forbidden contributions de-
termined from the RPA calculations. A secondary production
channel for the production of 36Cl is provided by the reaction
36Ar(¯νe, e−)36Cl that we have determined by combining shell-
model calculations for the Gamow-Teller strength and RPA
for the forbidden transitions.
The reaction 22Ne(νe, e−)22Na is relevant for the production of
the radioactive isotope 22Na and has been determined by using
data from the β+ decay of the mirror nucleus 22Mg combined
with shell-model calculations for the Gamow-Teller strength
and RPA calculations for the forbidden strength.

Other relevant cross sections are taken from the litera-
ture. Cross-sections for 4He are taken from Gazit & Barnea
(2007). For 12C(ν,ν’ 3He)9Be,12C(ν,ν(cid:48) 4He 3H p)4He, and
12C(ν,ν(cid:48) 4He 3He n)4He the values used by Woosley et al.
(1990) are adopted. One and two proton and neutron emis-
sion from 12C,14N,16,18O, 20,22Ne, 24,26Mg, and 26,28Si follow
the approach discussed by Heger et al. (2005). The cross
sections on 20Ne is based on charge-exchange data (Ander-
son et al. 1991) now extended to both neutral-current and
charged-current cross sections. Cross sections for νe absorp-
tion on 138Ba and 180Hf are based on measured Gamow-Teller
strengths (Byelikov et al. 2007) with branching ratios for par-
ticle emission based on a statistical model (Loens 2010).

In addition to the updated ν-induced reaction rates our work
includes recent updates of thermonuclear reactions rates, in
particular proton-, neutron- and alpha capture rates as con-
tained in the most recent release of the JINA REACLIB reac-
tion rate library, Version 2.2 (Cyburt et al. 2010) which con-
tains important improvements for example on proton induced
reactions (Iliadis et al. 2001) and neutron capture rates (Dill-
mann et al. 2014). Neutron capture rates are particularly im-
portant to determine the ﬁnal abundances of 138La and 180Ta.
While we use the updated rates from KADoNiS v0.3 for
179,180Ta(n, γ), we revert to the values by Rauscher & Thiele-
mann (2000) for 137,138La(n, γ) for reasons of consistency as
explained in §4.3.

3. SUPERNOVA MODEL AND NUCLEAR REACTION

NETWORK
The ν process operates before, during and after the shock
wave reaches the diﬀerent regions of the star. The evolution
of the shock-wave passing through the outer layers of the star
is calculated using the implicit hydrodynamics package KE-
PLER (Weaver et al. 1978; Woosley & Weaver 1995; Woosley
et al. 2002). In this framework, the explosion is driven by a
piston that is positioned at the edge of the Fe core and the tra-
jectory of the piston is adjusted to achieve an explosion energy
of 1.2 × 1051 erg for all the models we have computed. We
use supernova progenitors from a set that has been evolved
in the same numerical framework as discussed by Rauscher
et al. (2002), spanning initial masses between 13-30 M(cid:12). It
is unclear which of the explored models would explode self-
consistently and how the explosion energy and amount of
fallback depend on progenitor mass and structure (Woosley
& Weaver 1995; Horiuchi et al. 2014; Sukhbold & Woosley
2014; Ertl et al. 2016). Taking the same explosion energy
for all the models probably also aﬀects the systematics with
respect to the progenitor mass. The progenitor-explosion con-
nection, however, is still an open question and active ﬁeld of
research (M¨uller et al. 2016; Sukhbold et al. 2017).

The progenitor models we study here have been aﬀected
by the coding error aﬀecting the neutrino loss rates reported

Figure 1. Cross section for the reaction 26Mg(νe,e−)26Al based on the exper-
imentally determined strength only (exp) and also with additional strength
from calculated transitions at higher energies (exp + RPA). For compari-
son the theoretical results based on RPA and the estimate of Domogatskii
& Nadezhin (1980) are also shown.

tions from forbidden transitions relevant at high neutrino en-
ergies, the cross section has been supplemented by RPA cal-
culations. As can be seen in Figure 1, the contribution to the
cross section from forbidden transitions is rather small. Also
shown is the estimate of Domogatskii & Nadezhin (1980)
and the purely theoretical RPA cross section. With appro-
priate quenching factors RPA calculation have been shown
to give good estimates for the for the centroid of the B(GT)
strength and to fulﬁll sum rules.
It does not reproduce the
fragmentation of the distribution very well (Kolbe et al. 2003;
Balasi et al. 2015) which is important for reactions on inter-
mediate mass nuclei at low energies that are dominated by
a few individual transitions. The charged-current reaction
26Mg(νe, e−)26Al is particularly diﬃcult to treat in the RPA
because it is sensitive to the distribution of the strength at low
energies. Furthermore, for nuclei that are close to N = Z the
Gamow-Teller strength is not determined by the Ikeda sum
rule as it is the case of nuclei with moderate and large neu-
tron excess. Figure 1 also shows the cross sections based
on the RPA calculations and we ﬁnd that it is 60% smaller
than the one based on data for the relevant neutrino energies
This discrepancy exceeds the typical uncertainty that are ex-
pected from RPA neutrino cross section calculations (Balasi
et al. 2015). For neutral-current interactions only reactions
that lead to particle emission are relevant for nucleosynthesis
and electron antineutrinos are expected to have higher ener-
gies. For such reactions, collective excitations at higher en-
ergies become more relevant and the cross sections are less
sensitive to the details of the strength distribution. Therefore,
we expect the values for such reactions to be even more accu-
rate. Caurier et al. (1999) and others have shown that the shell
model can describe the details of the B(GT) strength distribu-
tion with high accuracy (see also Balasi et al. 2015). We use
results from such calculations wherever available.

The radioactive nucleus 36Cl is of some particular interest
because it has been found in material from the early solar
system (Murty et al. 1997). The reaction 36S(νe, e−)36Cl can
contribute to the production of 36Cl in supernovae. We have
determined the cross section by combining the data from the
mirror β+ decay of 36Ca and Gamow-Teller strength deter-
mined by shell-model calculations using the USDB interac-

by Sukhbold et al. (2017) that aﬀect the progenitor structure,
in particular the innermost regions. However, the ν process
operates mostly regions beyond the O/Ne shell which we are
not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by this error.

Since our results are based on one-dimensional calculations
the results depend on the choice of the mass cut, which de-
termines the amount of the material that is accreted onto the
central object (fallback) and determines how much of the in-
nermost part of the star can be successfully ejected by the ex-
plosion. Since the ν process mainly operates in outer regions
of the stellar mantle the results should not be aﬀected sig-
niﬁcantly by fallback. Nevertheless, fallback may trigger the
formation of a black hole resulting in a sudden end of neutrino
emission (Fischer et al. 2009). This possibility is neglected in
our calculations.

For the sake of comparison with previous studies and since
neutrino energies and luminosities from self-consistent ex-
plosion simulations are still rare and the quantitative rela-
tions to the progenitor model are not established yet (M¨uller
et al. 2016; Sukhbold et al. 2017) we model the neutrino
emission with a exponentially decreasing luminosity Lν =
L0 exp(−t/τν) with τν = 3 s and L0 chosen to result in a to-
tal energy of 3 × 1053 erg emitted as neutrinos and distributed
equally over the six neutrino ﬂavors. Abundances are evolved
using a nuclear reaction network including 1988 species up
to 2.5 × 104 s after bounce when the most short-lived nu-
clei have already decayed and those potentially interesting for
observations remain. If not stated otherwise, mass fractions
of radioactive nuclei quoted here have been extracted at this
time. Nuclear reactions are switched oﬀ, once the temperature
drops below 107 K. However beta-decays and neutrino reac-
tions are followed till the end of the calculation. The size of
the nuclear reaction network matches the co-processing net-
work that was employed in the calculations of the stellar evo-
lution of the progenitor models (Woosley et al. 2002). There-
fore, any eﬀects from the s process during stellar evolution
are included. This is particularly important for the nucleosyn-
thesis of the heaviest species: 92Nb, 98Tc, 138La and 180Ta.

4. STABLE ISOTOPES
The typical nuclei that are sensitive to neutrino nucleosyn-
thesis are 7Li, 11B, 15N, 19F, 138La, and 180Ta (Woosley et al.
1990; Heger et al. 2005), all of which are observed in the so-
lar system, but are not produced in suﬃcient amount by nu-
cleosynthesis calculations without including neutrino interac-
tions. Neutrino nucleosynthesis pushes the averaged produc-
tion factors of those nuclei closer to the solar system values.
Table 1 shows the production factors relative to 16O averaged
over our set of progenitors weighted with a Salpeter initial
mass function (IMF) with dN∗/dm∗ ∝ m−1.35
. The production
factor for a species A is deﬁned as PA = (X∗
A)/(X∗
16O).

We ﬁnd that due to the reduction of the ν energies the eﬀect of
the ν process is diminished which solves the problem of the
slight overproduction of 11B.

Figure 2 shows the dependence of the total yields of the
ﬁve ν-process isotopes shown in Table 1 on the initial mass
of the stellar model. Stellar structure aﬀects the ν process
by three major aspects. Firstly, as a secondary process the ν
process predominantly operates on abundant seed nuclei and
the composition therefore determines where the process can
occur. Secondly, the stellar density and temperature proﬁles
determines how strong the supernova shock aﬀects the regions
where the ν process seeds are located. Finally, the stellar

model determines the distance of the regions of interest from
the proto-neutron star and hence the intensity of the neutrino
ﬂuxes.

Due to the complex interplay of nuclear burning, convec-
tion and hydrostatic adjustment that governs stellar evolution
monotonous trends with respect to the initial mass are not ex-
pected. Still, Figure 2 shows that the relative enhancement for
the ν-process nuclei and in particular for the light elements Li
and B are quite robust with respect to the progenitor. In gen-
eral, the ν-process contributions tend to have a smoothing ef-
fect on variations with initial mass which we also ﬁnd for the
radioactive nuclei discussed in §5. In the following we will
discuss the production of 7Li, 11B, 19F, 15N, 138La and 180Ta
in more detail.

4.1. The light nuclei 7Li and 11B
The light elements 7Li and 11B are present in the solar sys-
tem with abundances of 1.5 × 10−9 and 4 × 10−10 (Lodders
2003). Since these nuclei are easily destroyed by charged par-
ticle reactions there is no stellar production mechanism and
the origin of theses abundances is a long-standing problem.
As discussed (e.g., by Prantzos 2007) irradiation by galactic
cosmic rays (GCR) is a promising scenario but also associ-
ated with large uncertainties. Most likely a combination of the
contributions from GCR irradiation and the ν process in core-
collapse supernovae is required to explain the solar abundance
as pointed out by Prantzos (2012) and Austin et al. (2014).

To illustrate how the ν process can produce the light ele-
ments the upper panel of Figure 3 shows the 7Li mass frac-
tion as a function of the mass coordinate for a 15 M(cid:12) pro-
genitor model for the set of low neutrino energies as deﬁned
above.

lations in which the neutrino reactions either only for charged-

material is subject to the most intense neutrino irradiation.
This can be seen in Figure 3 for the 15 M(cid:12) progenitor model,
where a noticeable mass fraction of 7Li and 11B are produced
right at the edge of the mass cut. The contribution from this
region to the total yield is of the order of a few percent and
thus negligible in the models considered here, but it depends
on the choice of the mass cut in parametric 1D simulations
and is sensitive to details of the explosion dynamics. If the
material is kept close to the neutron star for a longer time
due to turbulent convection and is later ejected, the contri-
bution of this region to the production of 7Li and 11B could
be larger. A ﬁnal answer to the role of the ν process in this
region therefore requires to take into account multi-D eﬀects
from self-consistent supernova simulations.

The bulk of 11B is produced in the thin C shell, see mid-
dle panel of Figure 3, by neutral-current spallation reactions
on 12C, i.e., 12C(ν, ν(cid:48)n/p), that mostly produce 11C that de-
cays later with a half-life of about 20 minutes to 11B. The
charged current reactions 12C(νe, e− p)11C and 12C(¯νe, e+n)11B
contribute almost as much as the neutral current for the low
energies. However, for the high energies the neutral current
clearly dominates. This is also visible in the averaged val-
ues in Table 1, where the production factors for the calcu-
lations with only neutral- and charged current reactions are
also shown. It illustrates the increased importance of charged
current processes for the “low energies” case. Figure 3 also
shows that there is a minor contribution to 11B in the O/Ne
shell which is due to 16O(ν, ν(cid:48)αp). Such multi-particle emis-
sion channels have not been included in previous studies but
are now taken into account for all nuclei in the reaction net-
work.

The production of 7Li and 11B requires the knockout of pro-
tons and neutrons from tightly bound 4He, 12C and 16O by
high energy neutrinos from the tail of the distribution. Con-
sequently, the shift of the neutrino spectra to lower energies
has a signiﬁcant impact on the production of these light el-
ements. Due to the sensitivity of 7Li and 11B to the neu-
trino energies Yoshida et al. (2005) have suggested that the
energies of νµ,τ and ¯νµ,τ can be constrained requiring a good
reproduction of the solar abundance of 11B considering con-
tributions from both cosmic-rays and ν process. We use up-
dated neutrino cross sections for reactions on 4He from Gazit
& Barnea (2007) that are slightly larger than those previ-
ously used, giving an increase in the production of 7Li and
11B compared to the yields presented by Heger et al. (2005)
when we use the same energies (“high energies” case). The
same cross sections for 4He and also comparably low ener-

At the base of the He-shell the neutral current neutrino-

gies have also been used in a recent study by Banerjee et al.
(2016) about the production of radioactive 10Be for a super-
nova model of a 11.8 M(cid:12) progenitor. 10Be is mostly produced
by the two proton emission channel 12C(ν, ν(cid:48) pp)10Be in the
O/C shell and for the models studied here we obtain an av-
erage yield of 3.9 × 10−11 M(cid:12) for the low neutrino energies
and 2.5 × 10−10 M(cid:12) for the high energies. Even with the high
neutrino energies the ν process does not produce enough 10B
and 6Li to explain the solar system values. While the solar
system value for 11B/10B is around 4, the average value we
get from our calculations is 11B/10B ≈ 100. Similarly we
ﬁnd 7Li/6Li ≈ 200 compared to a solar system value of 12.
Therefore, the abundances of 10B and 6Li require a contribu-
tion from cosmic ray spallation (e.g., Prantzos 2007) which
also contributes to 11B and 7Li. Based on models for the pro-
duction 11B and 10B by galactic cosmic rays (GCR), Austin
et al. (2014) have estimated that the ν process must produce
about 42 ± 4% of the solar 11B which is consistent with our
estimate based on the “low energies” case.

We ﬁnd that with realistic neutrino energies the production
of 7Li by the ν process is negligible. This is consistent with
the observation of the Lithium “Spite plateau” (Spite & Spite
1982; Sbordone et al. 2010) in metal-poor stars in the metal-
licity range −3.0 (cid:46) [Fe/H] (cid:46) −1.5. The top panels of Figure
2 show that the neutrino enhanced yields of 7Li and 11B are
not as sensitive to the progenitor model as, e.g., 19F. This is
because in the lower mass stars the relevant zones tend to be
closer to the proto- neutron star which compensates for the
overall narrower burning shells that contain smaller amounts
of relevant seed nuclei. Since the production of 16O increases
with progenitor mass that also means that the production fac-
tor normalized to 16O signiﬁcantly increases towards the low
mass end of the progenitor range we studied. Hence uncer-
tainties in the initial mass function will also play an important
role since the weight given to the low mass stars is crucial for
the average production factor.

4.2. 15N, and 19F
The ν process can contribute to the production of 15N and
to 19F in the O/Ne and O/C shells mostly via the neutral
current spallation of protons or neutrons 16O(ν, ν(cid:48) p/n) and
20Ne(ν, ν(cid:48) p/n) respectively, since 15O as well as 19Ne quickly
decay to 15N and to 19F respectively. Even the charged current
reactions 16O/20Ne(νe, e− p) and 16O/20Ne(¯νe, e+n) ﬁnally con-
tribute to 15N and to 19F. When we take into account the harder
spectrum for the heavy ﬂavor neutrinos we ﬁnd that the spec-
trally averaged cross section for the sum of the two charged
current channels is a factor 10 smaller than the combined neu-
tral current channels for the higher neutrino energies. For the
lower energies the charged current contribution is now smaller
by only a factor 3.

Heger et al. (2005) have already argued that this mecha-
nism can probably not account for the entire solar abundance
of 19F and can only produce small amounts of 15N. Table 1
shows that with the low neutrino energies the averaged 19F
yield is increased by 30% but still only reaches a production
factor of 0.2 and with high energies it is less than 0.3. This
is in agreement with the conjecture that the ν process in core-
collapse supernovae is not the only source of 19F which is sup-
ported by recent observational evidence. Spectral analysis of
nearby stars do not show a distinct correlation between O and
F abundances that would be expected if supernovae were the

main source for Florine (J¨onsson et al. 2017). Galactic chem-
ical evolution models (Renda et al. 2004; Kobayashi et al.
2011), still attribute a signiﬁcant component of the galactic
19F inventory to core collapse supernovae in combination with
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and Wolf-Rayet stars.

The lower panel of Figure 2 shows that the 19F yield ex-
hibits a relatively large sensitivity to the progenitor model.
Indeed, the mechanism behind the production depends signif-
icantly on the mass of the star.

For the 15 M(cid:12) model the supernova shock alone,

i.e.,
without neutrinos, increases the pre-supernova 19F content of
4.3 × 10−6 M(cid:12) to a yield of 5.5 × 10−6 M(cid:12), corresponding to a
production factor of 0.15. Neutrinos increase the production
factor to 0.20 or 0.28 for low and high energies respectively.
The thermonuclear component is mainly due to the reaction
sequence 18O(p, α)15N(α, γ)19F operating on 18O at the lower
edge of the He-shell where post shock temperatures reaches
0.67 GK at densities of up to 1500 g cm−3. This requires an
episode of convection to mix the 18O from the CNO cycle
down to the bottom of the He-shell where the peak tempera-
ture in the shock will be optimal. For the least massive star,
the 13 M(cid:12) model 18O remains concentrated in a narrow region
where the peak temperature reaches less than 0.5 GK and as
a results the shock heating does not really play a role for the
19F yield without neutrinos which here results almost entirely
from the pre explosive hydrostatic burning and gives a pro-
duction factor of 0.23. Including the ν process in this model
however gives the highest production factor among the mod-
els studied here of 0.27 for the low energies and 0.37 for high
energies.

The proﬁle of the 19F mass fraction for the 15 M(cid:12) model
is shown in the upper panel of Figure 4 where one can see
that the thermonuclear production at the base of the He shell
is conﬁned to a relatively narrow region. The thermonuclear
production of 19F requires two components. First the presence
of 18O that is a produced via 14N(α, γ)18F(β+νe)18O. 14N re-
sults from the CNO cycle and thus the region for suitable for
the thermonuclear production of 19F is sensitive to the physics
of Hydrogen burning. Secondly, the peak temperature reached
in this region needs to be in the range of 0.4 − 0.5 GK.

Assuming that internal energy after shock passage is domi-
nated by radiation one can relate the explosion energy Eexpl
and the peak temperature Tpeak at a given radius r can
as (Woosley et al. 2002):

Tpeak = 2.4

This illustrates that whether the optimal temperature condi-
tions for 19F production are reached for a given progenitor
abundance proﬁle is very sensitive to the radial position of
the compositional shell interfaces and also mildly sensitive to
the explosion energy. The optimal temperature itself is de-
termined by thermonuclear reaction rates and recent updates
on the proton capture rates (Iliadis et al. 2010) have a signif-
icant impact on the production of 19F. Compared to calcula-
tions with reaction rates based on Caughlan & Fowler (1988)
and Angulo et al. (1999) the updated reaction rates have in-
creased the total yield of 19F by 15% without neutrinos and
by 20% with the high neutrino energies for the 15 M(cid:12) model.
Trends of the 19F production with respect to the progenitor
mass can be related to these sensitivities of the thermonuclear
production. With increasing initial stellar mass the 19F pro-

of the range of masses we explore. Shown are the pre-SN mass fractions as
well as the ﬁnal mass fractions without neutrinos, with the updated set of low

a peak in the mass fraction around mass coordinate 2.5 M(cid:12), the ν process is
much more prominent for the more massive model. The background colors

duction factor without neutrinos tends to decrease because of
a larger production of 16O even though the yield of 19F itself
also increases substantially as can be seen in Figure 2. The ν
process has also a larger impact because the mass contained
in the O/Ne layer increases while the thermonuclear produc-
tion is increasingly suppressed. This is illustrated with two
examples in Figure 4 where the mass fraction of 19F for the
15 M(cid:12) and 28 M(cid:12) models are shown, representative for lower
and upper end of mass range considered here. For the 28 M(cid:12)
model the contribution from the ν process in the O/Ne layer is
the most prominent eﬀect of the explosion while the peak of
thermonuclear production at the inner He-shell in the 15 M(cid:12)
model gives an important contribution. For stars more mas-
sive than 17 M(cid:12), the ν process can boost the 19F production
by factors of up to 1.5-2 and 3-4 for low and high energies
respectively.

In contrast to the sensitivity of the thermonuclear produc-
tion mechanism to temperature and composition the ν process
is mainly sensitive to the distribution of 20Ne in the stellar
model as well as the cross sections for neutrino induced re-
actions on 20Ne, which is now based on measured Gamow-
Teller strength (Anderson et al. 1991; Heger et al. 2005). The
remaining uncertainties in understanding the origin of 19F are
therefore due to the stellar modeling and the thermonuclear
reaction rates as well as the contribution from other astrophys-
ical scenarios.

4.3. Long-lived 138La and nature’s rarest element 180Ta

Figure 5. Production factors relative to 16O for 138La and 180Ta for the new
set of low neutrino energies. Results including only neutral current (n.c.) and
only charged current (c.c.) are also shown. Only for the 14 M(cid:12), 15 M(cid:12) and
27 M(cid:12) models a signiﬁcant contribution from neutral current reactions to the
production of 180Ta appears while 138La is dominated by the c.c. reactions
for all the models. The values for 180Ta correspond to the assumption that
35% of the yield survive in the long-lived isomeric state.

The production of the isotopes 138La and 180Ta is of partic-
ular interest because they both are present in the solar system
but their production mechanism is not yet fully understood. In
contrast to the nuclei discussed above which are strongly af-
fected by neutral current reactions, the ν process aﬀects 138La
and 180Ta almost exclusively via νe captures. Therefore, those
two isotopes are the most promising species to infer νe prop-
erties via ν process nucleosynthesis. The cross sections for
138Ba(νe, e−)138La and 180Hf(νe, e−)180Ta are well constrained
based on experimentally measured transition strengths (Bye-
likov et al. 2007).

s-process nucleosynthesis calculations (Belic et al. 2002;
K¨appeler et al. 2004) have shown that around 80% of the so-
lar 180Ta can be produced in AGB stars mostly via decays
of excited states of 179Hf and 180Hf. However, Heger et al.
(2005) have also found an overproduction of 180Ta due to the
ν process in core collapse supernovae.

Understanding the origin of 180Ta is further complicated by
the fact that the Jπ = 1+ ground state 180Ta decays by electron
capture and β− with a half-life of 8.15 h and only its isomeric
9− state at an excitation energy of 75 keV is very long lived.
Due to its high spin, the isomeric state is eﬀectively decou-
pled from the ground state at low temperatures. We do not
treat 180Ta and its meta-stable isomeric state 180Tam as sepa-
rate species in our network. A signiﬁcant fraction of the 180Ta
the ground state has already decayed at the end of our nu-
cleosynthesis calculations at 2.5 × 104 s. Therefore, we take
the 180Ta abundance at 200 s after the start of the calculation
when most of the produced 180Ta is still present and the ther-
mal equilibrium between the ground state and the long-lived
isomeric state has just frozen out. Following the estimates
derived by Mohr et al. (2007) we assume that about 35% of
180Ta survives in the excited state.

Using the set of high neutrino energies, our results for 138La
and 180Ta are consistent with those of presented by Heger et al.
(2005) and Byelikov et al. (2007), giving almost solar produc-
tion of 138La and 180Ta. The 180Ta production shown in table 1
and Figure 5 are corrected for the fact that only the isomeric

decreases below 2.3 GK, the γ process leads to peak in the
production of 180Ta. The ν process increases the maximum
abundance but only operates after the shock has passed and
the material has cooled to below 2 GK.

For the particular case of the 15 M(cid:12) model the pre SN abun-
dance of 179Ta is larger than the 180Ta abundance. Therefore,
not only the direct charged current channel 180Hf(νe, e−)180Ta
plays a role but also free neutrons mainly from 16O(ν, ν(cid:48)n),
24Mg(ν, ν(cid:48)n) and 20Ne(ν, ν(cid:48)n) increase the ﬁnal yield of 180Ta.
Figure 7 shows that neutral current reactions alone lead to a
signiﬁcant increase of the ﬁnal yield even though the contri-
bution from 180Hf(νe, e−)180Ta still dominates.

As the peak temperature is lower at a higher mass coordi-
nate the conditions for an eﬀective production via the γ pro-
cess are no longer reached and the time integrated reaction
ﬂows change sign (see Figure 6). The competition between
the 179Ta(n, γ) and 180Ta(n, γ) is important for the ﬁnal abun-
dance of 180Ta in this region. Wisshak et al. (2001) have pre-
sented measurements for the neutron capture cross section on
180Tam and we use the reaction rates from the KADoNiS v0.3
database (Dillmann et al. 2014) for both reactions.

At mass coordinate of 2.0 M(cid:12) the main source for free neu-
trons changes from photodissociation to neutrino spallation.
Without neutrinos, the initial 180Ta mass fraction remains un-
changed in this region. Since this progenitor model provides
a relatively high initial abundance of 179Ta both processes, the
direct charged current and the neutral current providing addi-
tional free neutrons, are active.

Only in a small region between 2.2 and 2.3 M(cid:12) do the νe
captures on 180Hf dominate the production. Further out in
the He shell, free neutrons from 22Ne(α, n) destroy any 180Ta
that is produced by neutrinos, forming the upper boundary
of the production region. The role of neutral current and
charged current reactions depends signiﬁcantly on the pro-
genitor structure. In the range of progenitor models studied
here the 14, 15 M(cid:12) and 27 M(cid:12) models are the only cases for
which more than 10% of the ν process contribution to 180Ta
results from neutral current neutrino reactions due to the addi-
tional neutrons to be captured on 179Ta because those progeni-
tor models are already enriched in 179Ta and 180Ta while at the
same time depleted in 180Hf. The 27 M(cid:12) stands out in partic-
ular because 180Ta is already produced to full solar abundance
before the explosion and without neutrinos. The ν process in-
creases the production factor to 1.5 and 2.5 for low and high
neutrino energies respectively. The pre-explosive production
of 179,180Ta depends sensitively on the temperatures reached
during the last burning stages. If the O/Ne shell becomes hot
enough, photodissociation can change the abundances signif-
icantly. This shows that more detailed modeling of the pre
supernova phase is desirable to understand not only the explo-
sion mechanism as suggested by Suwa & M¨uller (2016) but
it might also have a large eﬀect on the synthesis of individual
nuclear species.

As can be seen in Figure 5 the 14 and 15 M(cid:12) stars also
show a particularly low ν process contribution to 180Ta and
a relatively large 180Ta and low 180Hf abundance before the
explosion, possibly as a result of slightly hotter burning con-
ditions during the evolution. (This is also reﬂected in the 98Tc
abundances shown in Figure 10.) The reaction cross section
for 180Hf(νe, e−n)179Ta is comparable to 180Hf(νe, e−)180Ta for
average neutrino energies around 10 MeV such that 179Ta can
also be produced in-situ. This process contributes 10-20%
to the total 180Ta yield. Averaged over the whole range of

Figure 6 illustrates the production of 180Ta in the 15 M(cid:12)
model. The reaction ﬂows have been estimated as integrated
instantaneous ﬂows based on the abundances at the beginning
of each time step of the network calculation. At the base of
the O/Ne shell, below 1.9 M(cid:12) the peak temperature exceeds
2.6 GK and the density reaches 5 × 105 g cm−3. Under these
conditions not only the pre-supernova abundance of 180Ta but
also 180Hf are destroyed by photodissociation (see Figure 7).
Since 180Hf is the target for the νe captures, this marks the
lower boundary of the production region. The prevalence of
(γ, n) over (n, γ) is indicated by the dashed lines in the up-
per panel of Figure 6. Further out, as the peak temperature

tors. The most striking feature is a overly large production of
138La for the 28 M(cid:12) model. This is due to a increased produc-
tion of Ba isotopes during the pre-supernova evolution. This
progenitor is also enhanced in weak s process nuclei. More
massive progenitors contain more mass in the O/Ne layer and
correspondingly give larger yields of 138La and 180Ta. When
looking at the production factors this increase of the yield is
compensated by an also increasing yield of 16O and a the de-
creasing weight of more massive stars in the IMF.

138La and 180Ta are mostly sensitive to electron ﬂavor neu-
trinos and since the production region in the O/Ne shell is
closer to the proto- neutron star they are also the most sensi-
tive to neutrino emission properties. Therefore, those nuclei
might also might be aﬀected the most by collective neutrino
oscillations as suggested by Wu et al. (2015).

4.4. Further eﬀects on stable isotopes
Recent studies dedicated to the ν process have focused on
individual nuclei and have employed limited sets of neutrino-
nucleus cross-sections expected to be relevant for the nuclei
of interest.
In particular when such approaches focus on a
single progenitor model, the question whether there are addi-
tional eﬀects in other scenarios or due to diﬀerent reactions
that have not been included always remains open. With our
complete set of cross sections we can survey the whole range
of the reaction network at once and study for the ﬁrst time the
complete eﬀect of ν-reactions on the explosive nucleosynthe-
sis in supernovae for a whole range of progenitor models. The
abundances of stable nuclei in the solar system are one of our
most accurately measured observables making processes that
have an eﬀect on those nuclei particularly important. Unless
major changes in the models for the progenitor composition
or the supernova mechanism itself are found, we hope to have
captured all possible processes and give in the following a
summary of the changes of the yields of stable nuclei after
decay, before we enter on the discussion of radioactive iso-
topes in §5.

Table 2 summarizes the maximum diﬀerences δrel = (Yno ν −
Yν)/Yno ν in the integrated yields of stable and very long-lived
(T1/2 > 1010 years) nuclei after decay that we ﬁnd among all
the progenitor models studied here. The table shows that large
eﬀects that change abundances by a signiﬁcant factor indeed
only appear for nuclei that have been identiﬁed in previous
studies. On the 10% level we ﬁnd a few more nuclei that are
aﬀected. In most cases the maximum eﬀect is found for the
more massive progenitors. That is because the inner regions
of more massive stars tend to be more compact, putting the
relevant O/Ne layer closer to the PNS. Only the light isotopes
7Li and 9Be that are produced at larger radii in the He-shell
are maximally aﬀected in at the low mass end of our progen-
itor range because here the He-shell is at smaller radii. Even
though 9Be and 10B are listed in Table 2 their yields corre-
spond to production factors of at most 4.5 × 10−2 and 7 × 10−2
respectively, too low to explain their solar abundances or so-
lar ratios with respect to 7Li and 11B. However, models of
GCR nucleosynthesis can account for those nuclei as stated in
§4.1. A modiﬁcation of 17O mass fraction is found through-
out the O/Ne shell and is mostly induced by neutron captures
on abundant 16O where the neutrons are released by neutral-
current spallation reactions. Locally the mass fraction of 17O
is increased by several orders of magnitude. However, the to-

tion due to (γ, n) reactions and in this case there is a region between 2.0 and
2.3 M(cid:12) where the ν process clearly is the dominant production channel.

progenitors 180Ta is underproduced with the new set of lower
neutrino energies (see table 1) ameliorating the tension with
the contribution from the s process in AGB stars.

138La is also a p nucleus that is bypassed by the s process
that moves along the chain of stable Barium isotopes. Figure 8
shows the most important reaction ﬂows aﬀecting 138La. Sim-
ilar to the case of 180Ta, the production of 138La at the base
of the O/Ne layer is dominated by the competition between
(n, γ) and (γ, n) reactions, leading to a peak of the production
even without neutrinos due to photodissociation of 139La at
peak temperatures of around 2.4 GK. As the peak tempera-
ture drops below 2 GK neutron captures dominate and tend
to move the material towards 139La. Without neutrinos, the
supply of 137La is very small. However, 138Ba(νe, e−n) can
lead to a substantial production of 137La because of the rel-
atively large abundance of 138Ba. The cross section for the
reaction 138Ba(νe, e−n) is based on the experimentally deter-
mined B(GT) strength Byelikov et al. (2007) in combination
with branching ratios for particle emission from a statistical
model as stated above.

In contrast to the case of 180Ta free neutrons from neutral
current spallation reactions alone do not have a signiﬁcant ef-
fect because the relevant target nucleus 137La is for all pro-
genitors much less abundant than 138Ba and would need to be
produced by the charged current reaction ﬁrst. In our calcula-
tions about 10% of the total yield of 138La result from neutron
captures on 137La. This contribution is sensitive to the ratio
between the 137La(n, γ) and 138La(n, γ) cross sections. There-
fore, we have taken the reaction rates by Rauscher & Thiele-
mann (2000) in spite of recent experimental constraints on the
138La(n, γ) cross section (Kheswa et al. 2015).

In Figure 8 one can see that further out in the O/Ne shell
where temperatures are too low to produce a signiﬁcant neu-
tron density by photodissociation the direct neutrino induced
production is the dominating reaction ﬂow, leading to an ex-
tended region where the 138La mass fraction is almost exclu-
sively determined by νe. Therefore, the production by the ν
process increases with the amount of mass in the O/Ne shell.
The upper panel of Figure 5 shows the production factor
for 138La over the range of progenitor models discussed here
with the set of our set of low neutrino energies. Figure 5 also
shows the results of calculations with only neutral current and

tal yield is dominated by the abundance of 17O in the He-shell
left over from H-burning via the CNO cycle. The modiﬁcation
of 33S occurs in the Si/O shell and it is aﬀected by several re-
actions, including the reaction sequence 34S(νe, e−)34Cl(γ, p)
as well as 34S(ν, ν(cid:48)n)33S. Thus, the contributions of charged-
and neutral-current reactions is about equal. At the top of the
O/Si shell 35Cl is enhanced by 36Ar(ν, ν(cid:48) p) where 36Ar is a re-
sults of the α-rich freeze out. The production factor for 35Cl
on average around 0.5, making the contribution from massive
stars a relevant for the solar system inventory of 35Cl. The
yield of 41K is modiﬁed mostly by 41Ca(¯νe, e+) and to a lesser
extent by 42Ca(ν, ν(cid:48) p). Averaged over the range of progenitors
the ν process increases the production factor for 41K from 0.48
to 0.52 for the low neutrino energies but it reaches values of
up to 1.8 for the 20 M(cid:12) progenitor for which the eﬀect of neu-
trinos is negligible. 176Lu is aﬀected by electron antineutrino
capture on 176Hf which is inherited from the initial metallicity
in the O/Ne shell, very similar to the cases of 138La and 180Ta
but interestingly involving antineutrinos in this case. The IMF
averaged production factor is however below 0.2. 176Lu can
be explained with the main s-process in AGB-stars and sub-
ject of current experimental eﬀorts (Roig et al. 2016). The
case of 176Lu is further complicated by a short-lived 1− ex-
cited state at 122 keV above the 7− ground state that β decays
with a half-life of 3.7 h. The short lived isomer is likely to
be populated thermally under supernova conditions and since
we do not include it explicitly in our calculations we expect
that our results overestimate the yield of 176Lu. In contrast
to that 113In is a p-nucleus that is also produced via the γ-
process. Neutrinos aﬀect its yield by νe captures on 113Cd in
the O/Ne shell where the mass fraction is increased by up to
a factor of 500 to values of up to 3 × 10−12 which is still a
factor ten smaller than the abundance inherited from the ini-
tial metallicity. This isotope is particularly interesting because
Travaglio et al. (2011) found it to be underproduced in type Ia
supernovae. However, in our calculation we also ﬁnd a pro-
duction factor of at most 0.32 because the abundance in the
O/Ne shell is still low compared to the solar abundance. The
optical model potentials to describe the involved (γ, α) reac-
tions have recently been studied by Kiss et al. (2013) where a
good agreement of the total cross-sections with the theoretical
calculations was found. We ﬁnd that the ﬁnal integrated yield
of 59Co is reduced by 11% in the 15 M(cid:12) model. This is due to
59Ni(νe, e−n)58Cu which reduces the abundance of the long-
lived 59Ni with a half-live of 7.6 × 104 yr that ﬁnally decays
to 59Co. The modiﬁcation of the 57Fe results mostly from
the charged-current reaction 58Ni(¯νe, e+ p) and also involves
58Co(ν, ν(cid:48) p). The 12% increase in the yield of 54Cr for the 23
M(cid:12) reﬂects the production of 54Mn by ¯νe capture on 54Fe that
reaches a mass fraction of 5 × 10−2 the O/Si shell. We see
that in the O/Si shell close to the mass cut reactions on the
Fe-peak elements induce some changes on the ejecta compo-
sition on the order of few percent. However, since our piston
model is not expected to give a very good description of these
innermost regions (Young & Fryer 2007) that are sensitive to
the imposed mass cut and potential fallback of material, fur-
ther studies with self-consistent explosion models are needed
to verify the signiﬁcance of these eﬀects. Heger et al. (2005)
have suggested reactions that could modify the yields of 51V,
55Mn, 78Kr, 138Ce and 196Hg. Our calculations include all the
reactions suggested by Heger et al. (2005) and we ﬁnd that the
yields of these nuclei are increased by 5-9%. The eﬀects on

the p-nuclei 113In, 137La and 180Ta shown here also illustrate
that it is necessary to include neutrino-induced reactions for
quantitative predictions of γ-process nucleosynthesis.

Unless signiﬁcant changes in the progenitor composition or
the neutrino properties are found, we can thus exclude and
further eﬀects on stable nuclei due to the ν process on super-
nova nucleosynthesis for stars in the mass range 13-30 M(cid:12) at
solar metallicity.

11

In addition to the important eﬀect on the yields of stable
isotopes we will see in the following that the ν process af-
fects the production of many radioactive nuclei. Mostly, the
modiﬁcation of the abundances of radioactive nuclei does not
result in noticeable changes of the yields of stable nuclei af-
ter the radioactive isotopes have decayed. However, for some
species the decay is accompanied by the emission of charac-
teristic γ-rays and others leave traces in the composition of
pre-solar grains. The most interesting cases are discussed in
detail in §5.2 and §5.3 but before we give an overview of the
eﬀects on radioactive nuclei, focusing on the 15 M(cid:12) progeni-
tor model as a representative example for the mass range we
have explored.

We ﬁnd that a large range of radioactive species are substan-
tially aﬀected by the ν process. Figure 9 provides an overview
of the relative eﬀects of the ν process for the whole range of
nuclei included in our calculations at 7 hours after the ex-
plosion when very short lived nuclei have already decayed.
The relative diﬀerences δrel shown there, are the maximum
values we ﬁnd for the whole range of progenitor models we
have looked at. The largest eﬀects appear close to stability
where seed nuclei with a large abundances relative to their
neighbors are present. Many nuclei are aﬀected on the 10%
level and a few show diﬀerences exceeding 50% or a factor
2. Below the Iron group the ν process mostly increases the
production of isolated rare stable and long-lived nuclei dis-
cussed in the previous sections. Spallation reactions on the
most abundant nuclei like 16O 20Ne and 24Mg do not change
the abundances of the targets noticeably but the neighboring
nuclei get produced and they provide light particles that af-
fect other nuclei. Additional neutrons are mostly captured by
heavier nuclei, leading to increased abundances on the neu-
tron rich side for A > 100 where the seed nuclei are inherited
from the initial solar metallicity. Since the γ process also op-
erates on those seed nuclei, the abundances on the proton-rich
side are also modiﬁed slightly. Around the Iron group many
long-lived nuclei exist and they are mainly produced in the
Si-shell close to the PNS where the neutrino ﬂuxes are largest.
After freeze out from NSE, neutrino interactions reshuﬄe the
abundances of the Fe-peak with diﬀerences at the 10% level,
leading for example to the modiﬁcation of the 59Co yields
discussed previously. In the region of A = 60 − 90 we can
see a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the abundances, both on the
neutron- and proton-rich side of stability. This is due to the
weak s − process nuclei and the operation of the γ-process
that already leads to the production of radioactive nuclei in
that region which are then modiﬁed further by neutrino inter-
actions. Radioactive, neutron-deﬁcient isotopes of As, Br, Kr,
Sr, Y and Zr are particularly enhanced with mass fraction typ-
ically between 10−12 to 10−10. For progenitors with a weaker
γ process free neutrons from spallation reactions are captured
on the most abundant s-process nuclei and lead to increased
abundances on the neutron-rich side in the same mass region.
The production of radioisotopes by the ν process has hith-
erto received only limited attention in the literature which has
mostly focused on the ﬁve isotopes discussed above. In the
following we will discuss the overall eﬀect of the ν process
on the production of radioactive nuclei, in particular focusing
on those that are relevant for observations.

Table 3 lists the IMF averaged nucleosynthesis yields for
a range of radioactive nuclei that are still present at around
7h after the explosion, including 32P, 72As, 84Rb, 88Y. Their
yields are increased by factors between 2 and 10 with the re-

already decayed and mostly species that are potentially interesting for
observations remain. Shown are the yields in units of M(cid:12) averaged with an

temperatures (“Low energies”), and with the choice of Heger et al. (2005)

alistic neutrino energies and the production of 72As would be
increased by almost two orders of magnitude with the choice
of high neutrino energies. The typical yields for 72As, 84Rb,
and 88Y are 10−9 M(cid:12), which may allow for the observation of
the gamma-ray decay lines only with very high precision ob-
servations. Further complicating the detection, their lifetimes
are of the order of a 100 days or shorter, putting their decay
signal in competition with 56Ni and its daughter 56Co which
by far dominates the early lightcurve and therefore outshines
the signature of the ν process. However, this shows that the ν
process can aﬀect a large range of radioactive nuclei among
which we can look for a suitable candidate to provide an ob-
servable signature of supernova neutrinos.

5.2. Short-lived radionuclides 36Cl, 92Nb and 98Tc in the

late input scenario

Isotopic ratios mostly derived from mass spectroscopy of
grains of meteoritic material have proven to be an invalu-
able source of information on stellar nucleosynthesis (Zin-
ner 1998; McKeegan & Davis 2003; Dauphas & Chaussidon
2011). While 138La and 180Ta are measurable as part of the
current composition of the solar system, indications for the
presence of now extinct radioactive nuclei, such as 36Cl and
92Nb have been found in (Sch¨onb¨achler et al. 2002; Lin et al.
2005; Jacobsen et al. 2009) primitive meteorites that are as-
sumed to have conserved the composition of the material from
which the solar system has formed. For 98Tc a positive detec-
tion is still missing, but upper limits are given by Dauphas
et al. (2002) and Becker & Walker (2003). In the following
we discuss the production of 92Nb, 98Tc and 36Cl in detail and
compare the observed abundance ratios from primitive mete-
orites.

Our calculations show (see Table 3), that neutrino interac-
tions increase the average yield of 36Cl by factors of 1.76 and
2.1 for low and high neutrino energies respectively and 92Nb
by a factors of 2.1 and 3.7. This relatively large increase that
does not vary a lot with the neutrino energies indicates that the
ν process provides a dominant and independent contribution.
Even though the total yield of 98Tc is increased by less than
20% locally the mass fraction of 98Tc in the O/Ne shell is
typically increased by one to two orders of magnitude be-

Note that the upper two panels are on a logarithmic scale white the 98Tc mass
fraction is on a linear scale because it shows a much smaller variation.

cause the total yield is dominated by the pre-supernova con-
tent of 98Tc in the He-shell. The enhancement is mostly due
to 98Mo(νe, e−). Despite the higher average energy of electron
antineutrinos 98Ru(¯νe, e+) is negligible because 98Ru is very
rare with mass fractions typically around 10−16, while 98Mo
is much more abundant with mass fractions around 5 × 10−9.
A particularly large amount of 98Mo is present in the 27 M(cid:12)
which is in enriched in γ process nuclei as discussed for the
case 180Ta in §4.3. For most progenitor models there is also a
direct contribution of the γ process during the shock heating
to 98Tc which is less than 10% of the ν process contribution.
Figure 10 shows the yields of 36Cl, 92Nb and 98Tc for the
stellar models we have studied. 36Cl and 92Nb exhibit very
similar systematics with respect to the progenitor mass be-
cause they are both very sensitive to the composition and tem-
perature at the inner edge of the O/Ne shell. 36Cl and 92Nb
are the two species with the deepest ν process production re-
gion. While their yields including the ν process are relatively
smooth with respect to the initial progenitor mass, large vari-
ations can be seen in the calculations without neutrinos. As
a result, also the relative enhancement ranges from factors of
2-5 for most progenitors up to a factor of 600 for the 24 M(cid:12)
model which yields particularly little 92Nb without the ν pro-
cess. The production mechanisms for 92Nb and 98Tc in the
ν process are very similar to the production of 138La and 180Ta.
The upper panel of Figure 11 shows the dominating reaction
ﬂows relevant for the synthesis of 92Nb in the 15 M(cid:12) progeni-
tor model. At the bottom of the O/Ne shell, photodissociation
and neutron captures compete and in an optimal temperature

Figure 11. Same as Figure 8 for 92Nb. The top panel shows time integrated
reaction ﬂows and the lower panel gives an overview over the mass fractions
of the involved nuclei. While the production of 92Nb proceeds via (n, γ)-(γ, n)
reactions in the deeper, hotter part of the O/Ne shell, the nu process leads to
a moderate production throughout the outer part of the O/Ne shell.

range the 92Nb mass fraction forms a peak even without neu-
trinos. The ν process contributes evenly through the whole
region which contains 92Zr with a mass fraction of around
3 × 10−8.

The 36Cl yield without neutrinos results mostly from neu-
tron captures on 35Cl at lower to mid O/Ne shell.
35Cl is
present in the progenitor but is also produced by the shock
heating. Providing additional neutrons, neutrino neutral cur-
rent spallation reactions have a minor eﬀect on the yield
while 36Ar(¯νe, e−)36Cl is the most important contribution of
the ν process for all of the progenitor models. During O-
burning 36Ar is copiously produced reaching mass fractions of
the order 10−2 in the ﬁnal Si-shell. This 36Ar-rich is exposed
to temperatures exceeding 3 GK and does not contribute to the
ν process. In the 15M(cid:12) model 36Ar is eﬃciently produced by
35Cl(p, γ) and 32S(α, γ) at the bottom of the O/Ne shell where
the peak temperature reaches up to 2.5 GK. While for most
other nuclei that are aﬀected by the ν process, the parent nu-
cleus is already present in the progenitor, 36Ar and also 35Cl
ﬁrst need to be produced by the shock heating. Hence, 36Cl
is also particularly sensitive to the shock propagation and the
explosion energy.

For the progenitors more massive than 15 M(cid:12) the produc-
tion region moves to smaller radii, into the upper part of
the Si-shell which also contains substantial amounts of Oxy-
gen. The 20 M(cid:12) model stands out with a rather large pre-
supernova production. In this model the ν process contribu-
tion is strongest in the Si/O-O/Ne transition region which con-
sists of Si and Ne in roughly equal amounts.

Cheoun et al. (2012) and Hayakawa et al. (2013) have dis-

esting as a potential chronometer. Mohr (2016) has analyzed
the impact of an isomeric state of 92Nb at 135.5 keV on its
nucleosynthesis in an explosive environment and found that it
does not aﬀect the production. The survival might however be
aﬀected by a reduced lifetime at low temperatures. The yields
of 92Nb and 98Tc might even be more enhanced by contribu-
tions from the neutrino-driven wind (Fuller & Meyer 1995;
Hoﬀman et al. 1996) which we do not include here.

Due to their long lifetimes and very low abundance 92Nb
and 98Tc are not suited for γ ray astronomy and 36Cl de-
cays mainly to the ground-state of 36Ar without characteris-
tic γ-rays. Therefore, we need other observational constraints
if we want to use the production of these nuclides to learn
about supernova neutrinos. Evidence for the presence of 92Nb
(Sch¨onb¨achler et al. 2002) and 36Cl (Jacobsen et al. 2009)
at the time the solar system has formed have been found in
meteoritic grains (see also Wasserburg et al. (2006) for an
overview).

Hayakawa et al. (2013) have estimated the contribution of
the ν process to the ISM inventory of 92Nb/93Nb based on
11 M(cid:12) supernova model. They conclude that the continuous
uniform production is insuﬃcient to explain the isotopic ratio
of ≈ 10−5 inferred from primitive meteorites (Sch¨onb¨achler
et al. 2002). While the estimate by Hayakawa et al. (2013)
is based on a single progenitor model we can use the IMF
weighted average of the stellar models we have studies. We
get an average ratio of (cid:104)92Nb/93Nb(cid:105) = 7.2 × 10−4 without neu-
trinos. This reaches 1.5 × 10−3 and 2.6 × 10−3 for low and high
neutrino energies respectively. Assuming a uniform produc-
tion model and taking supernovae as the sole production site
for both 92Nb and 93Nb we estimate the ratio as (Huss et al.
2009):

Where τ92Nb = 50.1 Myr is the decay timescale of 92Nb. With
a typical isolation time T = 10 Gyr we get a maximum ratio
of 1.3 × 10−7 in agreement with Hayakawa et al. (2013) and
still insuﬃcient to explain the observed ratio. Hayakawa et al.
(2013) conclude that a late injection event where the pre-solar
material is polluted by the ejecta from a nearby supernova
is more likely. Banerjee et al. (2016) have recently consoli-
dated this scenario using the short-lived radioactive 10Be pro-
duced by the ν process in low-mass supernovae as indicator.
In the case of such a late input scenario, we can relate the
measured abundance ratios to a single nucleosynthesis event.
If this is the case, properties of this event can be inferred from
measured abundance ratios. The main parameters are the de-
lay time ∆ between the injection event an the condensation
of the material into solids and the dilution factor f that indi-
cates to which extent the solar system material has been mixed
with the ejecta from the last event. Following Takigawa et al.
(2008) and Banerjee et al. (2016) we can estimate the number
ratio NR/NS between a radioactive isotope with mass number
AR and a stable reference nucleus with mass AS at solar sys-
tem formation as

solar mass fraction of the reference isotope, taken here from
Lodders (2003). Due to its long half-life, 92Nb is not very
sensitive to ∆ and therefore a good candidate to constrain f .
Assuming ∆ ≈ 1 Myr and the lowest 92Nb yield from the
13 M(cid:12) model we require a dilution factor f ≈ 5 × 10−3 to
achieve the measured ratio of 1.6 × 10−5 (Sch¨onb¨achler et al.
2002). This value is signiﬁcantly higher than what has been
suggested in the literature (Banerjee et al. 2016; Takigawa
et al. 2008; Wasserburg et al. 2006). Furthermore, this value
is also much larger than the upper limit of f < 5 × 10−4 that
results from with the same model from the upper limit on the
98Tc/96Ru ratio (Becker & Walker 2003). Thus, in particular
with the updated neutrino energies, it does not seem possible
to explain the pre-solar abundance of 92Nb with the input by
a low mass supernova.

Jacobsen et al. (2009) have given a value of (17.2 ± 2.5) ×
10−6 for the ratio 36Cl/35Cl from grains of the Allende mete-
orite and Lin et al. (2005) have found a value of 5 × 10−6 in
material from the Ningqiang carbonaceous chondrite, giving a
combined range of possible values of roughly (3 − 20) × 10−6.
Jacobsen et al. (2011) have suggested that late-stage irradi-
ation of the proto-planetary disk is the most likely origin of
pre-solar 36Cl while a stellar origin cannot be excluded. Us-
ing again our 13 M(cid:12) model with ∆ = 1 Myr and f = 5 × 10−4
as suggested by Banerjee et al. (2016) we ﬁnd 36Cl/35Cl ra-
tios of (8.3 − 9.5) × 10−6 for low and high neutrino energies
respectively compared to a ratio of 6 × 10−6 for the yields
without neutrinos. All of these values are currently consis-
tent with the range of observed ratios. However, the scaling
of the 36Cl/35Cl ratio with the neutrino energies make this nu-
cleus an interesting candidate as neutrino thermometer if the
parameters of the late input scenario and the meteoritic ratio
can be determined with better precision in the future.

5.3. γ-ray sources 22Na and 26Al
The characteristic γ-ray lines of the decay of long lived 26Al
has allowed (Diehl 2013) to estimate its present-day equilib-
rium content in the Galaxy to be 2.8 ± 0.8 M(cid:12). While the
sensitivity of 26Al yields from massive stars with respect to
thermonuclear reaction rates has been studied in detail by Il-
iadis et al. (2011), we here explore the uncertainties related to
the ν process.

The yield of 26Al is known to be enhanced by neutrino nu-
cleosynthesis (Woosley et al. 1990; Timmes et al. 1995). We
also ﬁnd that the yield of 26Al is increased by factors between
1.1 and 1.4 in the range of progenitor models studied (see Ta-
ble 3 and Figure 12). For low energies the maximum increase
is limited to a factor of 1.13 for the most massive progenitor
in our set. For the high neutrino energies, the enhancement is
within the precision of the galactic 26Al content estimate.

In massive stars 26Al can be produced in core H burning,
C burning in the core, and in a convective shell as well as
during explosive Ne/C burning in the supernova shock. 26Al
from H core burning survives largely in the envelope and is
partly blown away by stellar winds especially for more mas-
sive stars. It contributes 25%–55% of the total yield with the
exception of the 13 M(cid:12) progenitor for which the H burning
component constitutes 70%. This component is unaﬀected by
the explosion and by the neutrinos.

Figure 13 shows the 26Al mass fraction proﬁle for the
15 M(cid:12) model which contains a signiﬁcant amount of 26Al
from C-burning in the O/Ne shell before the supernova ex-

the O/Ne layer. The enhancement of the 25Mg(p, γ) is con-
ﬁned to a narrow region of optimal temperature, whereas the
26Mg(νe, e−) contributes more evenly but to a lesser extent
throughout the entire layer, decreasing with the neutrino ﬂux
at larger radii. The strength of the ν process also depends
on the position of the 26Al production peak within the O/Ne
shell which in turn depends on the peak temperature. The
deeper inside the peak is, the more mass is on the right hand
side of the peak where the ν process can operate eﬃciently.
While the total mass of the O/Ne layer scales with the ini-
tial progenitor mass, the condition of the peak temperature is
more sensitive to the detailed structure of the individual stellar
models. Comparing the two cases in Figure 13 also illustrates
this dependence of the ν process region on the position of the
26Al peak. The systematics of the total yield with respect to
the progenitor mass that are shown in Figure 12 follow the
trend of the 20Ne content of the pre-supernova models, mod-
ulated by structural details aﬀecting the position of the 26Al
peak within the O/Ne layer.

The relative diﬀerences δrel due to neutrinos to Figure 12
can be understood from these aspects. For the 13–18 M(cid:12) pro-
genitors, the 26Al peak is located in the middle of the O/Ne
shell, such that only a fraction of that shell is cold enough for
the ν process to contribute. Within this range of progenitors
the mass in the O/Ne shell increases giving rise to a slight
increase with progenitor mass. In all of these models a sub-
stantial amount of 26Al is present from hydrostatic burning
but little of it survives the high temperatures during the ex-
plosion. Starting from the 19 M(cid:12) the 26Al peak is right at the
bottom edge of the O/Ne shell. As discussed by Woosley et al.
(2002) energy generation in central C burning in stars heavier
than this can no longer overcome the neutrino losses which
leads to substantial changes in structure and nucleosynthesis,
including a reduced abundance of 26Al in the O/Ne shell. In
the mass range between 19–25 M(cid:12) there is basically no con-
tribution from C burning and the ν process has the strongest
relative eﬀect on 26Al because most of the O/Ne shell is cold
enough. The 20 M(cid:12) is a particular exception for which a con-
vective merger of shells has occurred and altered the structure
and composition (see also Woosley et al. 2002). The relatively
large yields for the 25–28 M(cid:12) progenitor models result from
a drastic increase of the contribution from hydrostatic C burn-
ing that decreases again in the 29 and 30 M(cid:12) progenitors. The
25–28 M(cid:12) progenitors also exhibit the largest compactness
parameter (O’Connor & Ott 2011)

in the range between 0.31-0.45 and also the largest pre-SN
content of 25Mg. Note that according the explosion criterion
suggested by Ugliano et al. (2012), stars with ξ2.5 > 0.35 are
likely to fail to explode as supernovae.

The fact that the ν process mostly adds to 26Al in a sec-
ondary way, i.e., by enhancing the abundance of protons,
makes its contribution to scale smoothly with the ν energy
compared to the weak dependence with the neutrino energy
seen in §4.3 and §5.2.

Since the position of the 26Al production peak depends on
the peak temperature at that radius we can see from equa-
tion 1 that it also depends on the explosion energy. For less
energetic explosions the optimal temperature is reached for
smaller radii and a stronger impact of ν process can be ex-

progenitor stars considered here. Shown are the yields without neutrinos and

plosion. Most of this 26Al is destroyed by the shock, mainly
by 26Al(n, p)26Mg and 26Al(n, α)23Na. The 19 M(cid:12) model
shown in the right panel of Figure 13 diﬀers signiﬁcantly in
its pre-supernova 26Al mass fraction which is almost negligi-
ble. However, both cases lead to a rather similar distribution
and yield of 26Al at the end. When looking at the whole range
of progenitors we ﬁnd that the ﬁnal 26Al yield in the ejecta
is eﬀectively independent of the inner C-burning component
of pre supernova 26Al. Similar results have been obtained
by Limongi & Chieﬃ (2006) for a diﬀerent set of progeni-
tor models.

Shock heating produces a peak in the mass fraction distri-
bution during explosive C/Ne burning. The reactions chain
20Ne(α, γ)24Mg(n, γ)25Mg(p, γ)26Al competes with neutron
induced reactions on 26Al and photodissociation at higher tem-
peratures. The optimal conditions for the production of 26Al
are found where the peak temperature reaches around 2.3–
2.5 GK, depending on the progenitors density structure. With
the explosion model used here we ﬁnd for all progenitors a
peak in the O/Ne shell. Deeper inside, i.e., left of the peak,
no 26Al survives the shock heating while the ν process can
operate further out.

Neutrinos contribute to the production of 26Al during the ex-
plosive phase by two diﬀerent mechanisms. Neutrino-induced
spallation reactions on the most abundant nuclei in the O/Ne
shell, 20Ne, 24Mg, and 16O increase the number of free pro-
tons, enhancing the reaction 25Mg(p, γ), which is also the
main production channel without neutrinos. Additionally, the
charged-current reaction 26Mg(νe, e−) also contributes with a
cross section that is now based on experimental data as de-
scribed in §2. Figure 13 illustrates the neutral-current and
charged-current contributions. With the softer neutrino spec-
tra, we ﬁnd that both charged- and neutral-current reactions
contribute to a similar extent to the production of 26Al in

pected because the neutrino ﬂuxes are higher closer to the
PNS.

The short-lived isomeric state of 26Al is not treated explic-
itly in our calculation, but we assume a thermal equilibrium
and use an accordingly adjusted β-decay rate (Fuller et al.
1982). The validity of this assumption in a supernova envi-
ronment has been conﬁrmed by Iliadis et al. (2011).

Our results show that the major uncertainty for the yields
of 26Al from massive stars originates from thermonuclear re-
action rates. Iliadis et al. (2011) have estimated such a un-
certainty to be a factor 3. As experiment and theory advance,
these uncertainties are bound to shrink and the predictions can
approach the precision of the observations.

The radioisotope 22Na has a relatively short half-life of
2.6 yr and decays to 22Ne emitting a positron followed by the
emission of a γ ray line at 1.275 MeV and two 0.511 MeV
γ rays from the annihilation of the positron. Woosley et al.
(1989) have estimated the contribution of 22Na to the bolo-
metric lightcurve and emission lines from SN1987A based on
a model that did not include the ν process. They conclude
that a detection of the γ-ray line emission might become pos-
sible with future instruments. In the following we describe
how the ν process aﬀects the production of 22Na for our range
of progenitor models and discuss the detectability of this en-
hancement in photometry and as radiogenic 22Ne in pre-solar
grains.

Figure 12 shows that supernovae could eject even larger
amounts of 22Na but representing a much smaller fraction of
the total mass of the ejecta. The last phases of shell burning
produce mass fractions around 1–4 × 10−6 of 22Na O/Ne shell.
Without taking into account the ν process the ﬁnal ejected
amount of 22Na is only determined by how much of it sur-
vives the shock heating which destroys 22Na for temperatures
above 1.8 GK. Just like in the case of 26Al the peak temper-
atures reached in the O/Ne shell are the determining factor
for the ejected amount of 22Na. In general, there is no con-
tribution from pre-supernova wind and from the He shell or
H envelope because most of the 22Na that has been produced
there during hydrostatic burning has decayed at the time of
core collapse. Figure 14 illustrates the distribution of the mass
fraction of 22Na for the 15 and 19 M(cid:12) progenitor models. At
mass coordinates around 1.9 M(cid:12) for the 15 M(cid:12) model and
around 2.1 M(cid:12) for the 19 M(cid:12) model there is also a small peak

in the mass fraction that results mostly from 21Ne(p, γ)22Na
competing with the neutron captures.

The ν process aﬀects this feature by changing the abun-
dance of free protons as in the case of 26Al discussed above.
This peak is however always negligible compared to the bulk
of the 22Na in the outer part of the O/Ne shell which re-
mains mostly unchanged by the passage of the supernova
shock without taking into account neutrinos. The ν process
liberates free protons that increase of the 22Na mass frac-
tion in the outer O/Ne shell as can be seen in Figure 14 and
also the charged current reaction 22Ne(νe, e−)22Na contributes.
23Na(ν, ν(cid:48)n)22Na has been suggested by Woosley et al. (1990)
as an additional source of 22Na. We ﬁnd that this channel
contributes 50% of the neutral current eﬀects for the 16 M(cid:12)
model. Figure 14 illustrates that both channels contribute to
about the same extend in the outer O/Ne shell. This can be
understood from the pre-supernova composition because the
O/Ne shell consists of roughly equal mass fractions of 22Ne
and 21Ne that range between 5 × 10−5 to 5 × 10−4 in the O/Ne
shell of this progenitor.
More striking is

the eﬀect of
the charged current
22Ne(νe, e−)22Na reaction that increases the mass fraction of
22Na in the O/C shell and produced the very prominent peak
for the 15 M(cid:12) progenitor that can be seen in the left panel of
Figure 14. In contrast, this production channel is negligible
in the 19 M(cid:12) model shown in the right panel. The O/C shell
contains very little 21Ne and therefore thermonuclear and also
neutral current contributions to 22Na are suppressed. The
mass fraction of 22Ne in the O/C shell which has not under-
gone C-burning is between 1 − 1.5 × 10−2 and very similar for
all progenitor models studied here. Still, only the 14–18 M(cid:12)
models show a major production of 22Na in the O/C shell due
to the νe capture on 22Ne that contributes at least 80% of the
total ν process enhancement for the progenitors in that range.
That is reﬂected in larger values for δrel in Figure 12. As de-
scribed above, the energy balance of C burning changes and
consequently also the star’s structure, when going from the 18
to the 19 M(cid:12) model. While the inner edge of the O/C shell is
located between 17,000 and 20,000 km for progenitor models
below 19 M(cid:12), its position moves out to more than 30,000 km
for most of the more massive models. This reduces the maxi-
mum neutrino ﬂux by more than a factor two and the neutrino
induced production is suppressed. The abundance of 22Na in

amount of 22Na the 15 M(cid:12) model the contribution from this region is negligible for the 15 M(cid:12) progenitor.

the outer part of the O/Ne shell is then much larger than at the
bottom of the O/C shell for the more massive models. The
27 M(cid:12) model is again an exception for which the abundances
in both regions are similar again. That is because the 27 M(cid:12)
model has very little 4He left in the O/C shell, such that the
neutron production via 22Ne(α, n), which drives the destruc-
tion of 22Na by neutron captures, is suppressed. For all the
cases studied here, the 22Na yield with only charged current
reactions is larger than with only neutral current reactions.
For the low neutrino energies the charged current alone con-
tributes at least 70% of the total ν process enhancement and
for the higher energies it is at least 60%.

Assuming a total yield of 2 × 10−6 M(cid:12) of 22Na Woosley
et al. (1990) found that the contribution of the 22Na decay to
the supernova lightcurve is of the order of 1036 erg/s, very
similar to the contribution from 44Ti decay during the ﬁrst 2-3
years. During this time, the decay of 56Co still dominates the
bolometric luminosity with 1040-1038 erg/s. Later 44Ti with a
half-life of 59 years dominates the luminosity while most of
the 22Na has already decayed. Therefore, we do not expect the
enhancement of 22Na due to the ν process to make a diﬀerence
for the bolometric lightcurve of a supernova (see also Kozma
& Fransson (1998) and Diehl & Timmes (1998)). The γ-ray
line at 1.275 MeV has been detected with the COMPTEL ex-
periment on board the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory as-
sociated with Nova Cassiopeia 1995. From this observation
Iyudin (2010) has estimated the total amount of ejected 22Na
to be ≈ 10−7 M(cid:12) with large uncertainties remaining due to the
distance (≈ 3kpc) and total ejected mass (≈ 10−3 M(cid:12)). Scal-
ing the results from Woosley et al. (1989) for a supernova at
a distance of 10 kpc with an escape fraction of 20% at 400
days after the explosion we ﬁnd a photon ﬂux of 5.3 × 10−6
cm−2s−1 per 10−6 M(cid:12) of ejected 22Na. Teegarden & Watan-
abe (2006) give the sensitivity of the SPI gamma-ray tele-
scope on the INTEGRAL satellite as 1.2 × 10−4 for the 1.275
MeV γ-ray line. The expected photon ﬂux for the largest
amount of 22Na we ﬁnd for the 30 M(cid:12) model would barely
lead to such a photon ﬂux. In order to distinguish between the
low and high energy scenario discussed here, we would re-
quire to resolve a ﬂux diﬀerence of 5 × 10−6 photons cm−2s−1
which might become feasible with future space based γ-ray
telescopes like the proposed e-ASTROGAM mission (Tatis-
cheﬀ et al. 2016).

In addition to the emission in the electromagnetic spectrum

22Na might also be relevant as the progenitor of 22Ne found
in meteoritic grains. Clayton (1975) has already pointed out
that the 22Ne-rich Ne-E(L) component in low density graphite
grains from meteorites ﬁrst found by Black & Pepin (1969)
could be a consequence of 22Na decay, i.e., the Ne found in
these grains would be pure 22Ne originally condensed as 22Na.
More recently Amari (2009) has concluded that the O/Ne
shell of massive stars are the most likely origin of the material
with very low 20Ne/22Ne ratios below 0.01. The condensation
of graphite grains in O-rich material is problematic (Lattimer
et al. 1978) even though models exists that would allow for it
(Clayton et al. 1999). The C/O ratio in the O/Ne shell is typ-
ically C/O ≈ 0.01 while this ratio reaches C/O ≈ 0.3 in the
O/C shell where charged current reactions produce most of
the 22Na. Modest mixing with the C/O shell right on top of it
could easily lead to material satisfying C/O > 1 and strongly
enriched in 22Na. The ν process allows for the production of
a large fraction of 22Na in more C-rich supernova ejecta but
the ratio of 12C/13C ≈ 104–105 in these layers still requires
mixing with the outer He or H rich layers to explain the high
12C/13C ratio of 313 ± 2 found in the same grains (Meier et al.
2012).

44Ti has been detected in supernova remnants (Iyudin et al.
1994; Grefenstette et al. 2014). It is produced mainly in the
inner ejecta in an α-rich freeze out of NSE Woosley et al.
(2002). At high temperatures, photon- and charged particle
induced reactions dominate over any neutrino contribution.
Therefore, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant eﬀect of neutrinos on the
yield of 44Ti. The production of 60Fe in supernovae is dis-
cussed in detail by Limongi & Chieﬃ (2006), where the neu-
tron density reached during the shock is identiﬁed as a key
parameter for the yield. Despite the increase in the density
of free nucleons due to neutrino spallation reactions, we ﬁnd
no signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the 60Fe yield because neutrons
are mostly captured by other, in particular heavier nuclei.

6. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed an updated study of ν process nucle-
osynthesis taking into account for the ﬁrst time the results
from recent supernova simulations (H¨udepohl et al. 2010;
Mart´ınez-Pinedo et al. 2012; Mart´ınez-Pinedo et al. 2014) that
predict noticeably lower average energies particularly for µ
and τ (anti)neutrinos. As a results we found charged current
processes to be now more relevant. Compared to previous

studies, we use a full set of neutrino-induced charged- and
neutral current reactions including spallation products for all
nuclei in our reaction network with charge numbers Z < 76.
Where cross sections derived from experimental data or dedi-
cated shell model calculations are available we use those and
we have included additional experimental data to infer the low
energy part of cross sections for several charged current pro-
cesses. This extensive compilation of cross sections for neu-
trino induced reactions will be published along with this arti-
cle and can then be employed for the calculation of the next
generation of stellar yield tables.
We have performed this study for a range of progenitor mod-
els for massive stars with ZAMS masses in the range between
13 and 30 M(cid:12), highlighting sensitivities and trends with re-
spect to stellar structure and composition. Our nucleosynthe-
sis study conﬁrms the contribution of the ν process to the pro-
duction of 11B, 138La, and 180Ta and avoids the overproduc-
tion of these elements that has been found in previous studies.
Furthermore, we discuss the interplay between γ process and
ν process production and ﬁnd that for individual progenitor
models, in particular for the 27 M(cid:12) model, neutral current
neutrino interactions leading to the emission of neutrons have
a major eﬀect on the production of 180Ta for some progenitor
models.

We conﬁrm that the ν process cannot be the primary ori-
gin of 19F and emphasize remaining uncertainties with respect
to thermonuclear reaction cross-sections and stellar structure.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that there is no nucleus for which the ν pro-
cess can be assumed as the only origin. Unless all other con-
tributions to the solar inventory are well understood it is there-
fore near impossible to use comparisons to the solar abun-
dances to give stringent constraints on neutrino properties. If
we consider the scenario of a nearby supernova explosion pol-
luting the pre-solar cloud with short-lived radioactive nuclei,
we ﬁnd that the 36Cl/35Cl ratio that can be measured in mete-
oritic grains is sensitive to the ¯νe neutrino spectra. In this case,
the 36Cl/35Cl ratio could be used as a “neutrino thermometer”.
Including neutrino reactions with on all nuclei in our net-
work we have identiﬁed eﬀects on nuclei on the 10% level
that have not been discussed before in the literature, including
the p-nucleus 113In. We also ﬁnd modiﬁcations of the yields
of 33S,40Ar,41K and Fe-group nuclei that originate from the
Si/O shell. Quantitatively, those results need to be taken with
caution due to the limits of our 1D supernova model. We also
have included reactions suggested by Heger et al. (2005) and
ﬁnd their eﬀects to be small. We conclude that for the range of
supernova models the most important eﬀects of the ν process
on the production of stable nuclei have been identiﬁed. In the
second part we discuss how neutrino-induced reactions, di-
rectly and indirectly, contribute to the production of long- and
short-lived radioactive nuclei. For 92Nb and 98Tc we also dis-
cuss the competition thermonuclear and neutrino induced pro-
duction. Within our model we cannot explain the 92Nb/93Nb
ratio found in meteoritic grains but due to the sensitivity of the
yields to nuclear reaction rates and stellar structure and poten-
tial contribution from neutrino driven winds further studies
are required.

The yields of 22Na and 26Al, both prime candidates for
gamma-ray astronomy, are enhanced. For 26Al the magnitude
of this enhancement is of the order of a few %. We also ﬁnd
that signiﬁcantly larger uncertainties due to nuclear reaction
rates remain. Even though the enhancement of the production
of 22Na is of the order of 50% we do not expect a direct eﬀect

on the supernova lightcurve and we estimate that the ﬂuxes of
characteristic γ ray emission are below the limit of the sensi-
tivity of current instruments. However, the production of 22Na
in the O/C leads us to suggest the ν process as the origin of
the Ne-E(L) component found in low density graphite grains.
Many of the relevant neutrino-nucleus cross-sections rely
almost entirely on theoretical calculations and are therefore
accompanied by large uncertainties. Experimental data on
the relevant transitions could help to reduce the uncertain-
ties in order to make inferences from observations more re-
liable. Furthermore, important uncertainties remain related to
the progenitor structure (Woosley et al. 2002), helium burning
rates (Austin et al. 2014), and the long term evolution of the
neutrino spectra and neutrino oscillations (Wu et al. 2015).
