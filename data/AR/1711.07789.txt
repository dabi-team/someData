Event-by-event multiplicity ﬂuctuations in nucleus-nucleus collisions are studied within the rela-
tivistic transport models: EPOS, PHSD, and UrQMD. As measures of particle number ﬂuctuations
we consider the scaled variances ω[X] for positive, negative, and all charged hadrons, and the
strongly intensive quantities ∆[K +, π+], Σ[K +, π+] for K + and π+ yields. At the SPS energy range
the ﬂuctuation measures are calculated for proton-proton, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions. Com-
parison with recent NA61/SHINE and older NA49 measurements of the multiplicity ﬂuctuations is
done. A validity of the model of independent sources, a role of the experimental acceptance, and
the centrality selection procedure are studied.

INTRODUCTION

The key questions of current research in high
energy nuclear physics are properties of strongly-
interacting matter and its transition to quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) state. Fluctuations are expected to
play an important role in study of the phase struc-
ture of QCD matter formed in relativistic heavy ion
collisions [1–3].
In the vicinity of the critical point
ﬂuctuations of particle multiplicity are signiﬁcantly
enlarged. This gives an opportunity to relate experi-
mental measures to critical behavior of system created
in nucleus-nucleus collision. The study of multiplicity
ﬂuctuations is a complicated experimental procedure
because of the ﬁnite detector acceptance and limited
particle identiﬁcation.
It is important also to elim-
inate event-by-event volume ﬂuctuations that are a
trivial source of multiplicity ﬂuctuations and are not
related to transition between phases.

The relativistic transport models such as EPOS [4,
5], PHSD [6, 7], and UrQMD [8, 9] allow to perform
theoretical study of microscopical properties of sys-
tems that are created in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) col-
lisions. This detailed description of A+A collisions
allows to study the particle number ﬂuctuations un-
der diﬀerent conditions, see, e.g.,
[10–16]. Recent
data from the NA61/SHINE Collaboration [17] show
a surprisingly diﬀerent behavior of scaled variances ω
for proton-proton (p+p) and A+A collisions. It has
been found that multiplicity ﬂuctuations are essen-

tially larger in p+p inelastic collisions than in most
central A+A ones. This result is in a contradiction
with the wounded nucleon model. An aim of the
present work is to investigate a dependence of the mul-
tiplicity ﬂuctuations on the system volume and colli-
sion energy within the microscopical transport mod-
els. We also compare the results of the transport mod-
els with the existing data.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the
measures of particle number ﬂuctuations are intro-
duced. In Sec. III a short reminding of the basic con-
cepts of three popular transport models is presented.
The main results are considered in Sec. IV, and Sec.
V summarizes the paper.

II. EVENT-BY-EVENT FLUCTUATIONS IN
TRANSPORT MODELS

In the present study the simulations of A+A col-
lisions were performed within the transport models
listed in Sec. I. The calculations are done for systems
of diﬀerent size, i.e., p+p, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb are
studied. The collision energies are taken in a range
of the CERN SPS accelerator which corresponds to
the center of mass energy of nucleon pair
sN N =
5.1 − 17.3 GeV. The speciﬁc energy values in the
present study are selected to coincide with those in the
NA61/SHINE experiment (see, e.g., Refs. [18, 19]).
Note that in the aforementioned experiment the cen-

trality selection is a rather complicated procedure de-
ﬁned by the number of projectile spectators [17, 20].
To model this centrality selection in Ar+Sc collisions
we use the recently introduced experimental accep-
tance maps of the forward energy spectrometer.

The following measures of particle number ﬂuctua-

tions are studied in the present work:

corresponds to the event-by-event averaging over a
sample of Nev events. The ﬂuctuation measures (1-
3) are intensive quantities, i.e., they do not depend
on the system volume. However, only ∆ (2) and Σ
(3), are called as strongly intensive quantities [21], be-
cause they are not sensitive to the ﬂuctuations of the
system volume. The system volume event-by-event
ﬂuctuations in A+A collisions are usually a result of
the varying impact parameter from collision to colli-
sion. Note that even at the ﬁxed value of the impact
parameter b = 0 the number of nucleon participants
still ﬂuctuates event-by-event, and these ﬂuctuations
inﬂuence the scaled variances ω[X].

The scaled variances ω of distribution particle num-
bers are used in a large number of both theoretical
and experimental papers, see, e.g., the reviews [2, 11].
The strongly intensive measures were introduced in
[21]. They are actively used now by the NA49 and
NA61/SHINE collaborations for the analysis of event-
by-event ﬂuctuations in p+p and nucleus-nucleus col-
lisions in the SPS energy region.

In the present work the following goals are pursued:

• Study of particle number ﬂuctuations versus col-
lision energy and system size. Search for any
non-monotonous behavior.

• Comparison of diﬀerent transport models.

• Investigation of the role of diﬀerent acceptance

criteria.

2

• Comparison of the transport model results for
ω[N−] with the recent data of the NA61/SHINE
Collaboration in p+p, Ar+Sc, and the NA49
data in Pb+Pb collisions.

There are two well known assumptions that con-
nect the scaled variances obtained in diﬀerent physical
scenarios. The ﬁrst one (see, e.g., [22]) presents the
scaled variance ωacc[X] for experimentally accepted
particles (e.g., in the ﬁnite kinematical region of a
momentum space) in terms of ω[X] which describes
the event-by-event ﬂuctuations in the case when all
particles are accepted:

ωacc[X] = 1 − q + q ω[X],

0 < q =

(cid:104)Xacc(cid:105)
(cid:104)X(cid:105)

< 1 , (5)

where q is the acceptance parameter equal to the ratio
of the mean values of the accepted number of particles
to the total one. Equation (5) ignores possible corre-
lations between accepted particles.
It predicts that
at q → 0 the scaled variance ωacc goes monotonously
to 1, the value that corresponds to the Poisson dis-
tribution. Thus, ωacc[X] increases linearly with q, if
ω[X] > 1, or decreases linearly with q, if ω[X] < 1.

The second assumption often used in A+A collisions
is the model of independent sources, e.g., the so-called
wounded nucleon model [23]. This model connects the
scaled variance ω[X] for particles produced in A+A
collisions with the scaled variance ωNN[X] and average
multiplicity (cid:104)X(cid:105)NN taken from nucleon-nucleon (NN)
collisions at the same collision energy

where ωp[Npart] represents the scaled variance of dis-
tribution of nucleon participants number.
As it was already pointed out in Sec.

I, the re-
cent data of NA61/SHINE Collaboration for ω[N−]
in p+p and central Ar+Sc collisions are in a con-
tradiction with Eq.6. An experimental veriﬁcation of
Eq.5 looks still problematic. In what follows we will
check whether Eq.5 and Eq.6 are valid within trans-
port model calculations.

III. TRANSPORT MODELS

A. EPOS

In the Energy Parton Oﬀ-shell Spliting (EPOS)
transport model, nucleus-nucleus scattering - even
proton-proton - amounts to many elementary colli-
sions happening in parallel. Such an elementary scat-
tering corresponds to the exchange of a “parton lad-
der”.

A parton ladder represents parton evolution from
the projectile and the target side towards the center
(small x). The evolution is governed by an evolution
equation, in the simplest case according to DGLAP.
In the following we will refer to these partons as “lad-
der partons”, to be distinguished from “spectator par-
tons” to be discussed later. It has been realized a long
time ago that such a parton ladder may be considered
as a quasi-longitudinal color ﬁeld, a so-called “ﬂux
tube” [5], conveniently treated as a relativistic string.
The intermediate gluons are treated as kink singular-
ities in the language of relativistic strings, providing
a transversely moving portion of the object. This ﬂux
tube decays via the production of quark-antiquark
pairs, creating in this way fragments – which are iden-
tiﬁed as hadrons.

The technical details of the consistent quantum me-
chanical treatment of the multiple scattering with the
energy sharing between the parallel scatterings can be
found in [24]. Hard scale independent correction fac-
tors are added to the bare amplitude of the Pomeron
to control the rise of the cross-section at high energy
and the multiplicity in HI collisions. The treatment
of these nonlinear eﬀects at high energy is explained
in [4]. In the present paper we use the newest version
of the EPOS model, the so called EPOS-LHC in the
CRMC mode.

B. PHSD

The Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics

(PHSD)
transport approach [6, 7, 25, 26] is a microscopic co-
variant dynamical model for strongly interacting sys-
tems formulated on the basis of Kadanoﬀ-Baym equa-
tions [26, 27]. The approach consistently describes
a full evolution of the relativistic heavy-ion collision
from the initial hard scatterings and string formation
through the dynamical deconﬁnement phase transi-
tion to the strongly-interacting quark-gluon plasma
(sQGP) as well as hadronization and the subsequent
interactions in the expanding hadronic phase as in the
Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach
[28]. The transport theoretical description of quarks
and gluons in the PHSD is based on the Dynami-
cal Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) for partons that
is constructed to reproduce lattice QCD for QGP
thermodynamics [26, 30] via eﬀective propagators for
quarks and gluons. The PHSD diﬀers from conven-
tional Boltzmann approaches in following aspects:
i) it incorporates dynamical quasi-particles due to the
ﬁnite width of the spectral functions;
ii) it involves scalar mean-ﬁelds that substantially
drive the collective ﬂow in the partonic phase;

3

iii) it is based on a realistic equation of state from lat-
tice QCD and thus describes the speed of sound cs(T )
reliably;
iv) the hadronization is described by the fusion of oﬀ-
shell partons to oﬀ-shell hadronic states and does not
violate the second law of thermodynamics;
v) the eﬀective partonic cross sections are self-
consistently determined within the DQPM and
probed by transport coeﬃcients in thermodynamic
equilibrium (shear- and bulk viscosity, electric con-
ductivity, magnetic susceptibility etc. [31, 35]).

At an early stage of relativistic heavy-ion colli-
sions color-neutral strings (described by the LUND
model [32]) are produced in highly energetic scatter-
ings of nucleons from the impinging nuclei. These
strings are dissolved into ’pre-hadrons’.
If the local
energy density is larger than the critical value for the
phase transition, which is taken to be ∼ 0.5 GeV/fm3,
the pre-hadrons melt into (colored) eﬀective quarks
and antiquarks in their self-generated repulsive mean-
ﬁeld as deﬁned by the DQPM [26, 30]. In the DQPM
the quarks, antiquarks, and gluons are dressed quasi-
particles and have temperature-dependent eﬀective
masses and widths which have been ﬁtted to lattice
thermal quantities such as energy density, pressure
and entropy density.

The transition from the partonic to hadronic
degrees-of-freedom is described by covariant transi-
tion rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs to
mesonic resonances or three quarks (antiquarks) to
baryonic states. In the hadronic phase PHSD is equiv-
alent to the HSD model [28, 29]. The PHSD approach
has been applied to p+p, p+A, and A+A collisions
from lower SPS to LHC energies and been successful
in describing of experimental data including single-
particle spectra, collective ﬂow as well as electromag-
netic probes [7, 25, 33–36].

C. UrQMD

[8, 9]

The Ultra relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynam-
is a microscopic trans-
ics (UrQMD) model
port theory based on the covariant propagation of
all hadrons on classical trajectories in combination
with stochastic binary scatterings, color string for-
mation and resonance decay.
It represents a Monte
Carlo solution of a large set of coupled partial integro-
diﬀerential equations for the time evolution of the var-
ious phase space densities fi(x, p) of particle species
i = N, ∆, Λ, etc.

The exchange of electric and baryonic charge,
strangeness and four-momentum in the t-channel is
considered for baryon-baryon (BB) collisions at low

energies, while meson-baryon (MB) and meson-meson
(MM) interactions are treated via the formation and
decay of resonances, i.e. the s-channel reactions. t-
channel reactions for MB and MM collisions are taken
into account from
s > 3 GeV on increasing to the
only MB, MM interaction type above

s = 6 GeV.

√

√

√

√

This framework allows bridging with one concise
model the entire available range of energies from the
SIS energy region (
s ≈ 2 GeV) to the RHIC en-
ergy (
s = 200 GeV). At the highest energies, a huge
number of diﬀerent particle species can be produced.
The model should allow for subsequent rescatterings.
The collision term in the UrQMD model includes more
than ﬁfty baryon species and ﬁve meson nonets (45
mesons).
In addition, their antiparticles have been
implemented using charge-conjugation to assure full
baryon-antibaryon symmetry.

All particles can be produced in hadron-hadron col-
lisions and can interact further with each other. The
diﬀerent decay channels all nucleon-, ∆- and hyperon-
resonances up to 2.25 GeV/c2 mass as well as the me-
son (e.g. K∗) decays etc. are implemented. At higher
energies the advantage of the hadron universality is
taken and a string model for the decay of intermedi-
ate states is used.

IV. RESULTS

The simulations of A+A collisions are performed
within the certain range of energies and system
sizes: p+p collisions are studied at energies
sN N =
6.27, 7.75, 8.77, 12.33, 17.28 GeV, while for Ar+Sc
and Pb+Pb collisions energies of the colliding sys-
tem are
sN N = 6.12, 7.62, 8.77, 11.94, 16.84
GeV. These are the energies that are available in the
NA61/SHINE experiment.

Diﬀerent acceptance cuts are applied for the trans-
port model simulations. The results are presented in
three diﬀerent acceptance regions:

The number of events was always taken large
enough, so that the statistical errors of our transport
model simulations are smaller than the size of markers
on the plots. However, an estimation of the systematic
errors in the transport models is rather problematic
and they are not shown in the presented plots. This is
because a lot of uncertainties, both experimental and
theoretical, within each of the considered models, e.g.
the treatment of the jet production in hard collisions
are quite diﬀer in the transport approaches which also
contributes to the systematic errors.

A. Scaled variance for particle number
ﬂuctuations

The scaled variances ω[X] are calculated for distri-
bution of multiplicities of negative N− and all charged
Nch particles in diﬀerent acceptance regions. Al-
though for mean particle multiplicities (cid:104)Nch(cid:105) the re-
sults of all mentioned transport models are quite in
agreement, the values of scaled variance ω[X] diﬀer
signiﬁcantly.

tions of
In the top panel, the
results for p+p inelastic collisions are shown, results
for Ar+Sc collisions are presented in the middle panel,
and Pb+Pb in the bottom panel. Both Ar+Sc and
Pb+Pb results correspond to the sample of events
with zero impact parameter b = 0. The results for
full 4π acceptance, |y| < 1, and the NA61/SHINE
acceptance are shown in the left, center, and right
column, respectively. From results presented in Fig.
1 one concludes:

1. The numerical values of ω[N−] appear to be

rather diﬀerent in diﬀerent transport models.

• full rapidity (4π) – all particles are accepted in

2. Most model calculations show a monotonous in-

each event;

• |y| < 1 acceptance – only particles with rapidity
−1 < y < 1 in the center of mass frame are
accepted;

• the NA61/SHINE acceptance – π±, K ±, p,
and ¯p are accepted in the forward rapidity
region 0 < y < ybeam and transverse mo-
menta pT < 1.5 GeV/c. Additionally, the
so-called NA61/SHINE acceptance map [37] is
then applied in order to take into account the
NA61/SHINE acceptance in the azimuthal an-
gle.

crease of ω[N−] with collision energy.

3. The results for 4π ﬂuctuations (left column) and
those for |y| < 1 (central column) show the behavior
of ω[N−] which is qualitatively diﬀerent from Eq.5,
i.e., for all transport models the values of ωacc[N−] for
|y| < 1 are larger than ω[N−] for full 4π acceptance.

4. The 4π values of ω[N−] (left column) in Pb+Pb
collisions with b = 0 are smaller than the correspond-
ing values in p+p inelastic reactions. This behavior
is qualitatively diﬀerent from Eq.6 which says that
ω[N−] in A+A collisions should be larger or equal to
ωNN[N−] in NN collisions.

B. Strongly intensive measures ∆ and Σ

The strongly intensive measures ∆ and Σ are ex-
pected to be independent of system volume ﬂuctua-
tions and thus these quantities do not require compli-
cated centrality selection procedure. The ∆[K +, π+]
as well as Σ[K +, π+] were calculated using studied

transport models. Their values are obtained with
NA61/SHINE acceptance applied. In Fig. 2 the cal-
culated values of ∆ and Σ are presented. For p+p
collisions all models produce values that are tightly
located near value of 1. For Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb col-
lisions the models do not show so good agreement
between each other, as for p+p. With a growth of

the system size the diﬀerences between studied mod-
els start to increase, and a non-trivial behavior for
UrQMD, HSD and PHSD results emerges.

ticle production at the SPS energies is dominated by
string fragmentation, while in UrQMD a signiﬁcant
part of particles is produced by formation and decay
of resonances.

C. Scaled variance in diﬀerent rapidity regions

In order to study the acceptance dependence of par-
ticle number ﬂuctuations, the scaled variances ω[N−]
and ω[Nch] have been calculated in central Pb+Pb
and inelastic p+p reactions within the HSD and
UrQMD models for diﬀerent rapidity regions |y| < ∆y
in the center of mass system of colliding protons. In
Fig.
3 the calculated scaled variances ω[N−] and
ω[Nch] versus ∆y are presented by solid lines. Dashed
lines show schematically the behavior which follows
from Eq.5. According to Eq.5 the both ω[N−] and
ω[Nch] should be monotonous functions of ∆y and
should go to 1 at ∆y → 0. However, Fig. 3 shows
that ω[N−] and ω [Nch] calculated in the HSD and
UrQMD models have a non-monotonous dependence
on ∆y. Therefore, Eq.5 appears to be in a qualitative
contradiction with the transport model results.

Note that the non-monotonous behavior is essen-
tially stronger for ω[Nch]. This is due to decay contri-
butions of heavy meson resonances into π+π− pairs.
Besides,
in p+p inelastic collisions UrQMD shows
much stronger ﬂuctuations than HSD near the maxi-
mum of ω[Nch]. This can be also explained by a con-
tribution from the resonance decays: in HSD the par-

D. System size dependence and comparison
with experimental data

In Fig. 4 the dependence of ω[N−] on the system
size is presented. The experimental results from [17,
38] are shown for p+p, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions1.
The transport models results for p+p collisions pre-
sented in Fig. 4 correspond to the sample of all inelas-
tic events. To fulﬁll experimental centrality selection
conditions in our calculations of Ar+Sc collisions we
use the acceptance maps of the Projectile Spectator
Detector (PSD) [39]. For every event in the minimum
bias sample the energy of all particles accepted by the
PSD is calculated and then the distribution of events
over the forward energy is used to select 0.2% of most

1 Please note, that NA49 acceptance for Pb+Pb point [38]
was slightly smaller than the acceptance currently used by
NA61/SHINE. In both cases 0 < yπ < ybeam rapidity (where
pion mass was assumed in calculation of rapidity) range was
used but in the NA49 analysis additional track cuts were used
which reduced the mean multiplicity of negatively charged
hadrons by 9% when compared to basic 0 < yπ < ybeam cut.

central (violent) collisions. In this centrality class, all
transport models produce the values of scaled variance
ω[N−] smaller than unity. These results are close to
the data and are in a contradiction with wounded nu-
cleon model given by Eq.6. The b = 0 fm Pb+Pb
collisions are calculated in the transport models and
compared with the 1% of most central events. As has

been stated in Ref. [40, 41] the HSD and UrQMD re-
sults in Pb+Pb collisions with zero impact parameter
can be a good approximation for the 1% most central
events.

A diﬀerence of the multiplicity ﬂuctuations in the
central collisions of heavy nuclei and inelastic p+p
collisions is clearly seen in the SPS energy region.

tiplicities of charged hadrons [42]. The suppression
takes place for large systems (even in the thermo-
dynamic limit) and survives partially in any ﬁnite
parts of the whole phase space. This ﬁnally leads
to ω[N−] < 1, i.e., the particle number distribution
for N− is narrower than the Poisson distribution. To
see such an eﬀect, one needs to make a very rigid
centrality selection. Otherwise, the enhancement of
ω[N−] because of ’volume ﬂuctuations’ overcomes the
charge conservation suppression and would lead to
ω[N−] > 1. For p+p collisions the situation is diﬀer-
ent. Firstly, the created system is small, and for small
systems the role of global charge conservation is sur-
prisingly not so strong as for large systems [42]. How-
ever, even more important is the fact that the ﬂuctua-
tion data for all inelastic p+p collisions are combined
in the one data set, i.e., the centrality selection was
never done for the multiplicity ﬂuctuations. To clar-
ify the basic physical eﬀects we propose to present the
existing p+p data within several narrow sets on the
‘centrality’. To deﬁne the centrality samples in p+p
collisions further checks will be probably required.

V. SUMMARY

√

The scaled variances of particle number distribu-
tion for N− and Nch, and strongly intensive measures
for ﬂuctuations of π+ and K + numbers are calculated
within several transport models, EPOS, PHSD, and
UrQMD, in p+p, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions at
the SPS energy region
sN N = 5.1 − 17.3 GeV. The
numerical values of scaled variances ω[N−] and ω[Nch]
obtained in diﬀerent models appear to be rather dif-
ferent. On the other hand, all of the studied trans-
port models do not show any signs of transition to
deconﬁned phase in ﬂuctuation measures. Although
in the PHSD model the partonic degrees of freedom
are present, and the horn in K +/π+ ratio is repro-
duced [36], still there is no non-monotonic behavior of
particle number ﬂuctuations as functions of the beam
energy.

Several unexpected properties are observed within
the transport model simulations for scaled variances
as functions of the system size and applied acceptance.
All transport models appear to be in qualitative con-

8

tradiction with the often used formula (5) implement-
ing the acceptance eﬀects. We observe that, in con-
trast to Eq.5, ω[Nch] depends non-monotonously on
the size of the acceptance interval in the central ra-
pidity region. We also ﬁnd that in most central Ar+Sc
and Pb+Pb collisions the scaled variance ω[N−] is
smaller than its value in inelastic p+p collisions at
√
∼= 17 GeV. This re-
the same collision energy
sult is in a qualitative contradiction with the model
of independent sources (6).

sN N

Transport models, with the experimental central-
ity selection and acceptance of the NA61/SHINE de-
tectors are applied to calculate ω[N−] in 0.2% most
central Ar+Sc collisions. Transport model results
give the values of ω[N−] essentially smaller than
1,
in agreement with the data. Transport models
give also a satisfactory description for ω[N−] of the
NA61/SHINE data in p+p inelastic reactions and for
the NA49 data in 1% central Pb+Pb collisions.

Obtained results support a conclusion that a contri-
bution of the quark-gluon degrees of freedom is hardly
seen in the present data on ﬂuctuations at the SPS en-
ergies. On the other hand, the NA61/SHINE data for
ω[N−] show rather diﬀerent behavior in p+p inelas-
tic reactions and most central collisions of heavy ions.
It looks rather interesting to investigate a transition
region between these two regimes. We plan to apply
transport models to study light nucleus-nucleus colli-
sions at the SPS energies in our future studies.
