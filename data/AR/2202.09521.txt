Tunability of energetic highly-elliptical high-harmonics is demonstrated. Harmonics are generated
in Ar gas, driven by intense two-color counter rotating laser electric ﬁelds, namely of the fundamental
and second harmonic frequency. For the experiment a MAZEL-TOV-like device is used, combined
with loose focusing geometry. By properly tuning the central frequency of the second harmonic, the
central frequency of the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) high harmonic radiation is continuously tuned.

INTRODUCTION

it

Ultrafast chiral processes can be studied using high
harmonic generation (HHG) [1–6]. HHG is an extreme
nonlinear process, which depends on many parameters,
such as the non-linear medium, the phase matching
conditions, the peak intensity, the duration and the
spectral phase of the driving pulse. By controlling
these parameters
is possible to manipulate the
spectral characteristics of the emitted extreme ultraviolet
(XUV) radiation [7–10].
It has been demonstrated
experimentally and theoretically that exploiting various
diﬀerent mechanisms the harmonic HHG spectra can be
inﬂuenced. Controlling parameters include the temporal
chirp of the driving laser, the ionization-induced blue
shift of the driver pulse in the generating medium
[7, 10, 11] and tuning the central wavelength of the
driver using an optical parametric ampliﬁer [12]. HHG
from linear polarized drivers produces harmonics with
linear polarization and therefore severe limitations are
imposed on the polarization state of the XUV radiation.
This limits the potential applications of an XUV HHG
In this context, the development of a tunable
source.
highly-elliptical XUV source adds an advanced tool
and such sources have recently emerged as a central
topic of ultrafast science promising invaluable insights
into chiroptical phenomena taking place on ultrashort
time scales. Ultrashort circularly polarized pulses in
the XUV domain have been generated at large-scale
facilities, such as free-electron lasers[13–15] and femto-

sliced synchrotrons [16–18].
sources more broadly available, table-top sources based
on high-harmonic generation (HHG) have also been
developed [19–23].

Additionally, the energy content of laser driven highly-
elliptical or circularly polarized XUV radiation was
limited to the pJ range per pulse [19–22] until recently
when energy content in the nJ range were demonstrated
in ref.[23]. It is known that the recollision mechanism,

which describes the HHG, entails that a stronger chiral
response arises at the cost of a greatly suppressed high
harmonic emission signal
[3]. Thus, the generation
of energetic highly elliptical high harmonics is also a
decisive step towards chiral-matter investigations.

In the present work, tunable energetic highly-elliptical
HHG in the XUV regime is
theoretically studied
and experimentally demonstrated, exploiting two-color
counter rotating electric ﬁelds under loose focusing
geometry. The output spectrum of the highly elliptical
HHG radiation can be tuned for a energy range of

II. THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS

The theoretical framework and detailed analysis on
the HHG by two colour bi-circular polarized ﬁelds can
be found elsewhere [24]. According to this theoretical
approach the HHG by two colour bi-circular polarized
driver ﬁelds has diﬀerent characteristics than that
resulting from the case of linearly polarized driver ﬁelds.
In this work the semi-classical three-step model in the
case of bi-circular ﬁelds is solved in order to be compared
with the esxperimental results presented in Section III. It
is well established in the literature and veriﬁed also in this
work that a typical spectrum of highly elliptical polarized
HHG radiation in counter rotating ω/2ω laser ﬁelds
consists of 3n±1 harmonics (n=1,2,3,...) [19, 20, 23–29]
1 presents the harmonic phase of the 3n±1
harmonics (n=4,5,6) as a function of the intensity for
Iω = I2ω of the two components of the bi-circular counter
rotating ﬁelds. Ar and Xe atomic targets are used as the
generation medium. The result is that the slope of the
phase as a function of the intensity for each harmonic
is small. Thus, a strong collective response when loose

to 400 mJ/pulse energy, τ L=25 fs duration and a carrier
wavelength of 800 nm. The experimental set-up consists
of three chambers: the focusing and MAZEL-TOV-like
[25] device chamber, the harmonic generation chamber
and the detection chamber (Fig.3). A laser beam of
3 cm outer diameter and energy of 32 mJ/pulse is
passing through a 3 m focal-length lens with the MAZEL-
TOV-like device positioned 1.25 meters downstream.
The apparatus consists of a beta-phase barium borate
crystal (BBO), a calcite plate and a super achromatic
quarter waveplate. A fraction of the energy of the
linear p-polarized fundamental pulse, is converted into a
perpendicularly polarized (s-polarized) second harmonic
ﬁeld in a BBO (0.2 mm, cutting angle 29.20 for type I
phase matching). The conversion eﬃciency of the BBO
crystal was maximized and it was found ≈ 30% at 403
nm. The run-out introduced by the BBO crystal for the
SHG of 800 nm was determined to be 38.6 fs. It is noted
that by placing the BBO after the focusing lens ensures
that the wavefronts of the converging fundamental laser
beam are reproduced into that of the second harmonic
ﬁeld. Therefore, the foci (placed close to a pulsed gas jet
ﬁlled with Ar) of the ω and 2ω ﬁelds coincide along the
propagation axis. Additionally, the beam passes through
a calcite plate at almost normal incidence (AR coated,
group velocity delay (GVD) compensation range 310-
450 fs), which pre-compensates group delays introduced
by the BBO crystal and the super achromatic quarter
waveplate. The super achromatic waveplate converts
the two-color linearly polarized pump into a bi-circular
ﬁeld, consisting of the fundamental ﬁeld and its second
harmonic, accumulating at the same time a group delay
diﬀerence of
400 nm and 800
nm central wavelengths. Assuming Gaussian optics, the
intensity at the focus for the two components of the
bi-circular polarized ﬁeld is estimated to be Iω≈I2ω≈
1x1014 W/cm2. After the jet, the produced XUV co-
propagates with the bi-circular driving ﬁelds towards a Si
plate, which is placed at 75o reducing the p-polarization

laser ﬁeld components Iω = I2ω the cutoﬀ law is
Emax=1.2Ip+3.17Up, where Up=Upω+Up2ω [24, 33].

Using the semi-classical three step model [24, 34] the
HHG spectrum was calculated for diﬀerent SHG central
wavelengths (399 nm ≤ λ2 ≤403 nm). The modiﬁcation
of the generated harmonic spectrum is determined by the
SHG central wavelength. It is shown theoretically (Fig.
2) here and veriﬁed experimentally in Sec. III C that the
harmonic photon energy decreases almost linearly with
the SHG central wavelength.

III. EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental Setup

For the formation of a bi-circular ﬁeld for highly-
elliptical HHG a compact MAch-ZEhnder-Less
for
Threefold Optical Virginia spiderwort-like (MAZEL-
TOV-like [25]) scheme is enforced. The experiment
was performed by exploiting the MW beamline of the
Attosecond Science and Technology Laboratory (AST) at
FORTH-IESL. The experiment utilizes a 10 Hz repetition
rate Ti:Sapphire laser system delivering pulses with up

FIG. 3. Experimental apparatus for the generation of highly elliptical energetic XUV radiation with tunability in the XUV
spectral range. A compact (15 cm long) MAZEL-TOV-like device is installed after a 3-m focal distance lens. The device
includes a BBO crystal, a calcite plate (both mounted independently on rotatable stages with high precision) and a rotatable
super achromatic quarter waveplate. The two-color bi-circular ﬁeld beam is focused into a pulsed gas jet ﬁlled with Ar. The
generated XUV radiation is reﬂected towards the detection area by a Si plate. The detection chamber consists of a calibrated
XUV photodiode, a pulsed gas jet ﬁlled with Ar and ﬁnally a µ-metal shielded TOF spectrometer.

component of the fundamental and the second harmonic
radiation while reﬂecting the harmonics [35] towards the
detection area. Directly after the Si plate, a pair of 5
mm diameter apertures were placed in order to block
the outer part of the ω and 2ω beams, while letting
essentially the entire XUV through. A 150 nm thick Sn
ﬁlter is attached to the second aperture, not only for
the spectral selection of the XUV radiation, but also to
eliminate the residual bicircular ﬁeld. A calibrated XUV
photodiode (XUV PD) can be introduced into the beam
path in order to measure the XUV pulse energy. The
transmitted beam enters the detection chamber, where
the spectral characterization of the XUV radiation takes
place. The characterization is achieved by recording the
products of the interaction between the XUV beam and
the Ar atoms. The electrons produced by the interaction
of Ar atoms with the unfocused XUV radiation were
detected by a µ-metal shielded time-of-ﬂight (TOF)
spectrometer. The spectral intensity distribution of the
XUV radiation is obtained by measuring the single-
photon ionization photo-electron (PE) spectra induced
by the XUV radiation with photon energy higher than
the Ip of Ar (IpAr=15.76 eV).

B. BBO Crystal spectral characteristics

The BBO crystal

is mounted on a high precision
motorized rotational stage and the spectral properties
of the SHG can be tuned as a function of the turning
angle ∆ϑ with respect to the propagation axis of the
25-fs IR laser pulse. For a monochromatic fundamental
wave,
the turning angle corresponds to the phase-
mismatching angle at the given fundamental wavelength.
For a broadband laser pulse, however, the turning angle

means the variation in the phase-matching angle, and
the central SHG wavelength is subsequently tuned with
respect to the phase-matching angle.

FIG. 4. (a)Spectral distributions of the fundamental and SHG
pulses for the two extreme positions of the turning angle ∆θ
with the propagation axis of the 25-fs IR laser pulse.(b) SHG
central wavelength as a function of angle ∆θ.

It was veriﬁed experimentally (Fig. 4(b)) that the
central wavelength of the SHG pulse varies linearly with
the turning angle ∆θ, and the wavelength variation ∆λ2
of the SHG pulse can be approximately expressed as
0.3 ∆θ for the BBO (0.2 mm, cutting angle 29.20
∆λ2
for type I phase matching) used in the experiment. The
corresponding spectral distributions of the fundamental
and SHG for two extreme positions of the turning angle
∆θ are shown in Fig. 4(a).

function of the angle ∆θ of the BBO crystal installed
in the MAZEL-TOV-like device. Characteristic highly-
elliptical HHG spectra are presented in Fig.5(a) for three
diﬀerent positions of ∆θ. An energy shift is clearly
observed towards higher photon energies when the the
angle (∆θ) between the propagation axis of the IR driving
ﬁeld and the BBO crystal is increased. Additionally
in Fig.5(b),(c),(d),(e) complementary measurements of
the detectable harmonics by the TOF spectrometer are
presented. It is revealed that the dependence of central
HHG energy on the central wavelength of the SHG is
almost linear. Also in the same ﬁgures, is depicted with
the blue line the same dependence calculated from the
energy conservation of the annihilated driver photons and
the emitted XUV photons (Table I)[29]. The maximum
150meV
energy shift observed is in the order of ∆E
for which is in good agreement with the theoretical
calculations presented in the Section II.

(cid:58)(cid:58)

The observed blue shift can be interpreted in the
framework of Strong Field Approximation (SFA). The
active electron acquires diﬀerent energy in the continuum
for each spectral component and for each central SHG
wavelength. Thus, the complex phase acquired during
this process is dissimilar. This leads to constructive
interference at diﬀerent spectral positions inside the
highly-elliptical HHG spectrum leading to the observed
blue shift in the energy domain.

From another perspective, this characteristic blue shift
can be attributed to the energy conservation of the
HHG process by two colour bichromatic counter rotating
electric ﬁelds. From energy conservation, the harmonic
frequencies generated by these ﬁelds is given by[29]:

Ω(n1,n2) = n1 · ω + n2 · βω

(1)

where n1 and n2 are integer numbers that are associated
with the number of photons involved in the process
of HHG at angular frequencies ω and βω, respectively.
On the other hand, parity and spin angular momentum
conservation requires that ∆n = n1 − n2=±1. Therefore,
in the case of 13th harmonic and 1.985 ≤ β ≤ 2.005
(which reﬂects our experimental conditions), the unique
pair (n1, n2) associated with this harmonic is equal to
(5,4).
It becomes evident that a linear dependence of
the generated harmonic photon energy is expected as a

D. Polarimetry experiments

The emitted harmonic radiation after the reﬂection of a
Si plate (which is placed at 75o) is sent through a rotating
in-vacuum polarizer, which consists of two UV protected
silver(Ag)-coated and one UV protected alluminum-
coated(Al) mirrors mounted on a common plate. The
angle of incidence on each mirror is 75o(Ag)-60o(Al)-
75o(Ag) . Finally, the harmonic radiation is diﬀracted
using a spherical holohgraphic grating and detected by
a microchannel-plate detector (MCP) coupled with a
phosphor screen. The contrast of the rotating in-vacuum
polarizer, was extracted by polarimetric measurments of
the linear polarized XUV radiation (MAZEL-TOV-like
device out of the beam line) Fig. 6(a) and it was found
R=1.8 ± 0.3. Polarimetry measurements were performed
for the 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th harmonics as a function of
the angle ∆θ of the BBO crystal installed in the MAZEL-

TOV-like device. Therefore, polarization scans were
acquired during which the polarizer was rotated between
0° and 360° in step of ∼8° and average of 40 pulses
per step. From these scans the ellipticity of the high
harmonics as a function of the BBO angle was derived.
The measurement of the state of polarization of the HHG
spectra conﬁrmed highly elliptical polarization reaching
ellipticities up to ∼ 85% at ∼22 eV at it is presented in
Fig. 7 and with no clear dependence on the BBO angle
of rotation.

E. Energy Content estimation

The energy content estimation was performed by
applying the experimental procedure similar to the one
400 nJ
reported in ref [23] and it was found EXU V
per XUV pulse at the source. Brieﬂy, the estimation
of the energy of the highly elliptical XUV radiation
emitted per pulse is enabled at a ﬁrst step by measuring
the linearly polarized XUV pulse energy by means of
an XUV photodiode. Then, by comparing the HHG
spectra depicted in the measured photoelectron spectrum
of Ar atoms upon interaction with highly elliptically and

(cid:58)(cid:58)

linearly polarized XUV light (see Fig. 8) at the same
detection conditions, respectively, we can deduce the
energy per pulse of the highly-elliptical XUV emission.
This major improvement with respect to the previous
reported value (
100 nJ at the source)[23] was due
to the improvement of the focusing conditions and the
increment of the input energy (32 mJ) of the TW 10 Hz
laser system.
It should be stressed that no depletion
of the atomic target (Ar) was observed during these
experimental investigations and therefore higher energy
content of highly elliptical XUV radiation is expected by
increasing the input energy, at the cost of the possible
damage of the optical components.

loose focusing conditions. By properly tuning the central
frequency of the second harmonic of the fundamental
frequency, the central frequency of the XUV HHG can
also be continuously tuned. By performing polarimetric
measuremens ellipticities up to ∼ 85% at ∼22 eV were
achieved and with no clear dependence on the BBO angle
of rotation. The energy per driving laser pulse, in the
20 eV, was found to be in the range
spectral region
400 nJ per XUV pulse at the source. The
of EXU V
maximum energy shift observed was ∆E
150meV which
is in good agreement with the theoretical calculations.
