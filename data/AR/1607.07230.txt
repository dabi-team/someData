The particle-in-cell MCC code NAM-ECRIS is used to simulate the ECRIS plasma sustained in a mixture of Kr with O2, N2, Ar, Ne and He. The 
model assumes that ions are electrostatically confined in ECR zone by a dip in the plasma potential. Gain in the extracted krypton ion currents is 
seen for the highest charge states; the gain is maximized when oxygen is used as the mixing gas. A special feature of oxygen  is that most of 
singly charged oxygen ions are produced after dissociative ionization of oxygen molecules with the large kinetic energy release of around 5 eV 
per ion. Increased loss rate of energetic lowly charged ions of the mixing element requires building up of the retarding potential barrier close to 
ECR surface to equilibrate electron and ion losses out of the plasma. In the mixed plasmas, the barrier value is large (~1 V) compared to the pure 
Kr plasma (~0.01 V), with the longer confinement times of krypton ions and with the much higher ion temperatures.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Mixing  two  gases  in  ECRIS  (Electron  Cyclotron 
Resonance  Ion  Source)  is  a  common  technique  to 
increase  currents  of  the  highest  charge  states  of  the 
heavier  element.  This  is  the  gas  mixing  effect 
discovered  experimentally  by  A.G.  Drentje  [1]  in 
1983. To see the effect, flow of the lighter gas into a 
source chamber should be  much  higher than  flow  of 
the  working  gas.  Oxygen  is  found  to  be  the  best 
mixing  gas  for  such  gases  as  argon,  krypton  and 
xenon,  with  the  heavier  isotope  18O2  giving  a  mild 
improvement  [2]  compared  to  16O2.  Gain  in  currents 
depends on the source chamber wall conditions being 
not pronounced when (oxidized) aluminum is used as 
the  chamber  wall  material  [3,4].  The  negative 
manifestation  of  the  effect  is  a  drastic  drop  in  the 
extracted ion currents  if even very  small amounts of 
the heavier element present in the ECRIS plasma [5]. 

There  are  few  explanations  of  what  is  happening 
when  two  gases  with  different  masses  are  mixed  in 
ECRIS  [6].  The  most  frequently  given  answer  is 
connected to an evaporative cooling of ions [7]. Ions 
in the plasma are supposed to be confined within the 
Electron  Cyclotron  Resonance  (ECR)  zone  by  a 
negative  dip  in  a  globally  positive  plasma  potential 
[8]. The dip value is such as to equilibrate the ion and 
electron  losses  out  of  the  plasma.  The  ion  losses 
depend  on  the  ion  velocities  and  charge  states;  the 
energetic light and lowly charged ion ions are leaving 
the  trap  relatively  fast,  which  results  in  a  cooling  of 
those  ions  that  remain  be  trapped.  Then,  it  is 
conjectured that in the gas mixed plasmas the ions are 
colder  and 
the 
electrostatic barrier. 

thus  are  better  confined  by 

At this, no attention is paid to changes in the potential 
dip value when mixing two gases in the source. Also, 
it  follows  from  the  model  that  hydrogen  and  helium 

should  be  the  best  mixing  gases,  which  is  not  the 
case.  To  solve  the  problem,  it  is  argued  that  oxygen 
has  higher ionization rates compared to helium, thus 
giving  the  higher  electron  density  inside  the  ECR 
plasma  and  the  increased  rates  of  ion  production  for 
the  working  gas  [9].  Hydrogen  as  the  mixing  gas  is 
supposed  to  be  special  because  of  formation  of  the 
negative  hydrogen  ions,  which  quench  the  highly 
charged  ions  in  the  charge-change  collisions.  It  is 
unclear,  however,  why  argon  is  not  effective  as  the 
mixing  gas  for  such  elements  as  krypton  or  xenon, 
having higher ionization rates compared to oxygen. 

Evaporative  cooling  of  ions  is  believed  to  be 
combined with the increased electron life time in the 
plasma  due 
to  decreased  electron-ion  collision 
frequency caused by lowering the average ion charge 
state in the mixed plasma. 

D. Meyer et al. [10] argued that the ECRIS plasma is 
strongly influenced by heavy ions sputtered from the 
source  chamber  walls.  Fluxes  of  the  sputtered 
particles  depend  on  energy  of  ions  impinging  the 
walls  and,  subsequently,  on  the  plasma  potential, 
which  is  decreasing  with  addition  of  light  elements 
into  discharge.  The  gas-mixing  effect  is  considered 
from  its  “negative”  side  as  the  result  of  the  source 
performance  degradation  under  an  influence  of  the 
heavy  impurities  coming  from  the  walls;  authors 
demonstrated  that  drop  in  the  extracted  currents  of 
nitrogen  ions  correlates  with  appearance  of  copper 
ions coming from the walls of their copper resonator 
used  as  the  source  chamber.  There  are  doubts, 
however,  whether  this  works  for  stainless  steel 
chambers  typical  for  ECRIS  and  for  such  working 
gases as xenon or krypton. 

remain  unknown  at 

 We  conclude  that  exact  reasons  for  the  gas-mixing 
effect 
the  moment.  This 
motivated us to perform the numerical simulations of 
processes in ECRIS plasma produced in a mix of two

different gases. For  study of ECRIS,  we develop the 
(Numerical 
special 
Advanced  Model  of  ECRIS).    The  results  of  the 
calculations show that the ion temperature is actually 
increased  in  the  gas  mixing  mode  in  parallel  to 
increase  of  the  potential  dip  value.  Even  with  the 
increased  ion  temperature,  the  ratio  between  the  ion 
confining  potential  and  ion  temperature  is  higher  in 
the  gas  mixing  mode  of  operation,  resulting  in  the 
improved ion confinement. 

II.  MODEL 

The  code  is  based  on  the  model  that  is  described  in 
details elsewhere [11]. The NAM-ECRIS is a Particle-
in-Cell  Monte-Carlo  Collisions  code  that  traces  a 
movement  of  macro-particles  representing  ions  and 
atoms  in  ECRIS  plasma.  Number  of  macro-particles 
(2×105) remains constant during the calculations with 
the  particle  statistical  weight  used  as  an  input. 
Another input is a temperature of electrons inside the 
ECR  volume  (Tew),  which  is  varied  in  the  range  of 
few  keV.  The  electron  temperature  outside  zone  is 
always set to 5 eV. The electron density is calculated 
from charge-neutrality requirement; it is a sum of ion 
charge densities inside a computational cell. 

In calculations, the plasma is characterized  with two 
important  values  –  gas  flow  in/out  of  the  source 
chamber  and  power  carried  away  to  the  chamber 
walls by the lost electrons. The values are calculated 
from  the  full  ion  current  out  of  the  plasma  for  the 
power  and  from  the  particle  flow  into  the  extraction 
aperture for the gas flow. 

Charged  particles  undergo  elastic  and  inelastic  ion-
ion  and  electron-ion  collisions,  charge-change 
collisions  with  neutral  particles  and  neutralizing 
collisions with the source chamber walls. 

A.  Fields and geometry 

Computational  particles  are  moving  in  the  magnetic 
field  of  ECRIS.  The  solenoidal  component  of  the 
field  is  calculated  with  Poisson/Superfish  code  [12]. 
The multipole component is calculated analytically in 
the  hard-edge  approximation.  We  perform 
the 
calculations  for  the  fixed  geometry  and  magnetic 
field structure of DECRIS-SC2 18 GHz source [13]. 
The inner diameter of the source chamber is 7.4 cm, 
the  chamber  length  between  the  biased  disk  and 
extraction  electrode  is  28  cm,  and  the  chamber  is 
made  of  stainless  steel.  Diameter  of  the  extraction 
aperture  is  1  cm.  Hexapole  magnetic  field  at  the 
radial wall is 1.1 T, magnetic fields at the axis at the 
injection and extraction sides of the chamber are 1.97 
and  1.35  T  respectively.  The  minimum  field  is  0.47 

T. The magnetic configuration is selected close to the 
experimentally  found  optimum  for  the  medium-
charged  (Q~8+)  argon  ion  production.  Calculations 
are  preformed  for  18  GHz  microwaves  resulting  in 
0.643 T of the electron cyclotron resonance value of 
the magnetic field. 

B. Potential dip and life times 

To  see  the  gas-mixing  effect,  the  model  should  be 
modified  compared  to  the  version  described  in  [11]. 
We  assume  that  the  ion  motion  is  affected  by  a  dip 
(Δφ) in the positive plasma potential. The dip or jump 
in  the  plasma  potential  occurs  at  the  ECR  surface. 
The  code  fixes  the  moment  when  an  ion  crosses  the 
ECR surface; the component of ion velocity along the 
magnetic  field  line  is  calculated.  There  are  two 
possibilities – either ion moves out of the zone or into 
the  zone.  If  the  ion  leaves  the  ECR  volume  and  its 
kinetic energy along the line is less than Q× Δφ (Q is 
the  ion  charge  state),  the  ion  is  reflected  back  from 
the  barrier  elastically.  If  the  ion  is  energetic  enough 
to  overcome  the  barrier,  its  velocity  along  the 
magnetic 
the 
corresponding  value.  When  ion  moves  into  the  ECR 
volume  from  outside,  it  is  accelerated  along  the 
magnetic field line with the energy gain Q× Δφ. 

is  decremented  by 

field 

line 

The value of the potential dip Δφ is selected such as 
to  provide  that  the  calculated  ion  and  electron 
confinement times in the plasma are equal each with 
an  allowance  of  ±5%.  The  ion  confinement  time  is 
calculated  as  a  ratio  between  total  number  of  ion 
charges inside the ECR volume and total ion current 
(Ii)  toward  the  source  chamber  walls  and  into  the 
extraction aperture: 

(1) 

The  charge-state  resolved  confinement  times  of  ions 
are calculated by comparing for each charge state the 
numbers  of  ionizing  events  Iion-Q  per  second  with  a 
flux of ions with charge Q out of the plasma Iwall-Q: 

Here,  an  average  electron  density  is  calculated  for 
each  type  of  ions  during  its  stay  in  the  hot  plasma 
before  ionization;  kQ  is  the  corresponding  ionization 
rate  that  includes  the  single  and  multiple  ionization 
channels.  The  individual  values  of  the  electron 
density  are  required  to  account  for  the  different

spatial  distributions  of  different  types  of  ions  inside 
the plasma. 

When  appropriate,  we  compare  the  calculated  ion 
confinement  times  with  the  estimation  given  by 
Rognlien and Cutler [14] for the collisional ions:  

(3) 

Here,  L  is  the  length  of  the  system  (close  to  the 
length  of  the  ECR  volume,  L=7.3  cm  in  our 
conditions), Ti is the ion temperature, R is the mirror 
,  where  Bmax and Bmin are the 
ratio (

maximal  and  minimal  magnetic  fields  of 
the 
magnetic trap, for this specific case Bmax=0.643 T and 
the mirror ratio is calculated along the magnetic field 
the  ECR  volume,  R=1.25)  and 
lines  within 

  is  the  ion  velocity  (Mi  is  the  ion 

mass). The authors of [14] estimate that the times (3) 
are accurate for the moderately large mirror ratio and 
barrier height (Q/Δφ≥3Ti). 

The  electron  losses  are  calculated  by  using  the 
following expression: 

(4) 

The  first  term  in  the  sum  accounts  for  the  electron 
losses into the loss cone  due  to the electron-electron 
and  electron-ion  collisions.  The  corresponding 
average 90˚ scattering frequencies are [15]: 

(5) 

Here, electron 

 and ion densities (

 ([m-3]) 

logarithms 

are averaged over the ECR volume; λee and λei are the 
Coulomb 
for  electron-electron  and 
electron-ion  collisions  respectively,  and  Tew  is  the 
electron  temperature  [eV]  inside  the  ECR  volume. 
The  g(R)  factor  in  (4)  depends  on  the  magnetic  trap 
mirror ratio R. We use the mirror ratio averaged over 
all  magnetic  field  lines  that  cross  the  ECR  volume, 
with taking as the Bmax value the magnetic field at the 
point  where  the  line  crosses  the  source  wall;  R=2.3 
for the DECRIS-SC2 18 GHz source. 

For  g(R)  the  estimation  from  R.F.  Post  [16]  is: 

(6a) 

We note here that the Pastukhov’s time [17], which is 
often  used  for  calculations  of  electron  losses  out  of 
magnetic trap of ECR plasma, is derived for R»1 and 
underestimates  the  electron  loss  rate  in  our  case  by 
factor ~3 compared to the Post’s time: 

  (6b) 

The  second  term  in  (4)  describes  the  electron  losses 
due  to  the  pitch-angle  scattering  of  electrons  by 
microwaves  [18].  There,  PRF  is  the  total  microwave 
power  absorbed  by  electrons  [eV/sec]  and  V  is  the 
plasma volume [m3], which is supposed to be equal to 

the  ECR  volume.  For 

  we  use  the  results 

of  the  Fokker-Planck  calculations  of  Cluggish  et  al. 
[18],  fitting  them  with  linear  dependence  on  the 
electron temperature:

independent  on  the  mean  electron  energy,  electron 
density  and  microwave  power.  The  fact  that  the 
factor  ε  is  increasing  with  the  mean  electron  energy 
in  their  calculations  when  changing  the  gas  pressure 
was attributed to be caused by changes in EDF.  

isotropic  distribution 

The third term f(R, Ees) in (4) represents the electron 
losses that occur soon after creation of the secondary 
electrons  in  electron-ion  collisions  [18].  In  our 
model,  the  new-born  electrons  are  supposed  to  have 
in  velocity  space  and 
an 
energies  Ees  equal  to  ionization  potential  of  the 
ionized particle [19]. We calculate the probability for 
the new-born electron to be in the loss cone by saving 
the  starting  coordinates  of  the  electrons  and  their 
energies  for  the  large  number  of  ionizing  events 
during the calculations; the coordinates and energies 
are then imported into the special code that traces the 
electron  movement  in  the  source  magnetic  field. 
Electrons are supposed to be reflected back from the 
thin sheath adjacent to the walls if their energy along 
the  magnetic  field  line  is  less  than  25  eV,  which 
corresponds  to  the  typical  value  of  the  plasma 
potential.  Electrons  are  traced  for  the  sufficiently 
long time to calculate the number of electrons lost to 
the  walls  while  bouncing  and  drifting  in  the  trap.

Electron  scattering  in  collisions  with  the  ions  and 
other electrons is omitted at this stage. The procedure 
is  repeated  several  times  during  the  calculations  to 
prove  that  the  f(R,Esec)  value  is  stable  with  an 
accuracy of ±5%. Typical  values of the lost electron 
fraction  are  in  the  range  0.05-0.2;  the  largest  values 
are calculated for krypton because of relatively large 
energies  of  the  newly  created  electrons.  Without 
taking  into  account  the  electron  retardation  by  the 
positive plasma potential, the lost electron fraction is 
0.3  with  no  dependence  on  the  electron  starting 
energies. 

All  factors  in  (4)  are  defined  with  a  rather  large 
uncertainty.  We  use  then  as  the  first  approximation 
keeping  in  mind  that  separate  investigations  are 
needed  to  calculate  the  electron  losses  out  of  the 
plasma in more accurate way. 

C.  Wall neutralization processes 

Gas  in  the  source  chamber  is  heated  due  to  the 
incomplete  energy  absorption  by  a  surface  after 
neutralization  of  energetic  ions  impinging  the  walls. 
We  distinguish  between  the  light  (lighter  than  the 
atoms  of  wall  material)  and  heavy  ions:  the  heavy 
ions are supposed to be completely thermalized after 
their  reflection,  for  the  light  ions  we  use  the  energy 
accommodation  coefficients  from  [20].  The  energy 
defined 
is 
coefficient 
accommodation 
. Here, Er and Ei are energies 
as

of  the  reflected  and  incident  particles  respectively, 

Ew=

 is the mean energy of the wall atoms, Tw is 

the  surface  temperature.  The  energy  accommodation 
coefficient  depends  on  angle  of  incidence  of  the 
projectile (θ) and on the ratio between masses of the 
projectile  and  wall  atoms  (u=Mg/Mw,  Mw=56), 
.  We  set  the  primary  energy 

of  ions  equal  to  25×Q  eV  (assuming  the  plasma 
potential of 25 V), angle of incidence for ions is close 

to  the  normal  in  respect  to  the  surface  (
); 
for  the  subsequent  collisions  of  the  thermalizing 
atoms  with  the  walls  we  use  an  averaged  value 

for
. Ions are supposed to be completely 
neutralized after their reflection from the surface. For 
helium,  the  reflected  atoms  carry  away  almost  80% 
of  their  primary  energy,  20  or  40  eV  depending  on 
the  ion  charge  state.  Each  time  as  the  thermalizing 
atoms hit the surface, they lose some fraction of their 
energy  and  then  move  slower;  time  of  residence  in 

the  source  vacuum  chamber  steadily  increases  while 
atoms are cooling. The result is a presence inside the 
source  of  the  suprathermal  atoms  with  the  mean 
energy of ~0.1 eV. 

For  the  atomic  oxygen  we  take  into  account  a  high 
probability  for the  atom  recombination  with  forming 
the  molecular  oxygen  in  collisions  with  the  walls 
(αr~0.5  for  the  stainless  steel  surfaces)  [21].  We 
assume  that  the  formed  molecular  oxygen  is  fully 
thermalized after atom recombines in collision with a 
wall.  This  probability  is  relatively  small  for  the 
atomic  nitrogen  (αr  ~0.01)  [22],  as  well  as  for  the 
collisions of atomic oxygen with oxidized surfaces  – 
for the quartz surfaces the coefficient can be as small 
as αr~10-4 [23]. 

D.  Ionization processes 

Ionization  rates  for  the  light  ions  (Z≤30)  are  taken 
from the fits of [24]. For the krypton ions, we use the 
fits from [25] for all charge states except Kr0. For the 
atomic  krypton  we  use  the  cross-sections  from  [26], 
taking into account large errors in ionization rates of 
the  lowly  charged  ions  in  [25].  Scaling  from  [27]  is 
used for the multiple ionization rates for all gases but 
argon.  For  argon,  rates  for  the  double  ionization  are 
taken 
Ionization  and  dissociation 
dynamics  of  the  neutral  and  singly  charged  oxygen 
and  nitrogen  molecules  is  treated  with  taking  into 
account  the  reactions  listed  in  the  Table  I.  For 
comparison,  ionization  rates  for  the  oxygen  and 
nitrogen atoms are also given in the Table I.  

[28]. 

from 

It  is  seen  that  after  dissociation  of  molecules  the 
singly  charged  ions  and  atoms  of  oxygen  and 
nitrogen  are  born  with  the  relatively  high  energies. 
The  oxygen  fragments  are  more  energetic  compared 
to  the  nitrogen  ones.  The  molecular  dissociative 
recombination rates are calculated  with the fits  from 
[31,  34].  The  rates  are  non-negligible  only  for  the 
cold  electrons  (Tec=5  eV)  and  the  recombination  is 
taken  into  account  for  the  regions  outside  the  ECR 
volume. 

and 

The accepted procedure of the numerical simulations 
is as follows: we fix the desired level of the coupled 
microwave  power 
electron 
temperature  inside  the  ECR  volume.  The  potential 
dip  value  is  selected  to  ensure  that  the  electron  and 
ion  confinement  times  are  equal  each  other;  the 
particle  statistical  weight  is  adjusted  to  reach  the 
selected level of the coupled power.

III.  RESULTS 

A. Injection of one gas 

We begin with showing the charge state distributions 
(CSD) of the extracted ions without mixing the gases. 
The spectra for krypton plasma are presented in Fig.1 
for two electron temperatures Tew (8 and 16 keV) and 
for  the  coupled  microwave  power  PRF=500  W; 
spectra for the oxygen plasma are shown in Fig.2 for 
the  same  electron  temperatures  and  power.  Plasma 
with  the  lower  electron  temperature  is  obtained  by 
increasing  the  gas  flow  if  the  coupled  microwave 
power is fixed at some level. Increase in the gas flow 

results  in  global  shift  of  CSD  to  the  lower  charge 
states with increase in currents of lowly charged ions 
and  with  decrease  of  currents  of  the  highest  charge 
states.  This  global  tendency  is  often  observed  in 
practice. 

There is an anomaly in the shape of the krypton CSD 
at  charge  state  (8+).  This  is  explained  by  the 
relatively high ionization rate for Kr8+ ions. Other set 
of  ionization  rates  [35]  also  shows  this  anomaly. 
Measurements  confirm  the  local  decrease  of  the 
extracted ion currents for this charge state [36].

He→N2→O2→Ne→Ar→Kr.  The  electron  density 
has the same ordering, being maximal for the lightest 
element in the sequence. We note that the difference 
in the electron confinement times is not very  strong, 
varying by a factor of around two comparing krypton 
and helium. 

Most  of  the  electron  losses  from  the  plasma  are 
caused  by  the  electron-ion  scattering  process:  for 
krypton, losses due to the electron-electron scattering 
(Eq.4)  equal  to  around  5%  of  the  total  losses,  while 
the  RF-induced  scattering of  electrons contributes to 
≈20% of the total losses at Tew=12 keV. For helium, 
the  budget  of  electron  losses  is  as  follows:  20%  are 
due  to  the  electron-electron  collisions,  20%  are 
caused  by  the  RF-induced  loss-cone  scattering  and 
the  remaining  60%  of  losses  are  the  result  of  the 
electron-ion  collisions.  In  addition,  18%  of  all  new-
born electrons are lost soon after their creation for the 
krypton  plasma  (factor  f(R,Esec)  in  Eq.4).  The  value

for 
f(R,Esec)=0.12.

The calculated parameters of the krypton and oxygen 
plasma  in  these  conditions  (plus  the  intermediate 
cases of Tew=12 keV and 4 keV) are listed in Table II. 
Parameters  of  the  plasmas  are  also  shown  for  Tew=4 
and 12 keV for injection of helium, neon, argon and 
nitrogen  gases  for  the  same  500  W  of  the  coupled

mean electron density inside the ECR volume. 

The  largest  potential  dip  values  Δφ  are  observed  for 
the  oxygen  plasma,  the  lowest  dips  are  seen  for  the 

Experimentally,  contribution  of 
the  RF-induced 
losses of electrons can be estimated by measuring e.g. 
electron current to the biased disk after switching off 
the  RF  heating  of  the  plasma  [37].  Typical  drop  of 
the current is around 50%, indicating possible under-
estimation  of  the  loss  rate  in  our  model.  Definitely, 
more investigation on the subject is needed. 

For  all  investigated  gases,  increase  in  the  gas  flow 
(decrease  in  the  electron  temperature)  results  in 
decrease of the electron confinement time and in the 
lower  potential  dip  values.  The  electron  density  is 
slightly  decreasing  with  increasing  the  gas  flow;

The  ion  temperatures  for  krypton  and  other  inert 
gases  (except  argon)  are  decreasing  with  increasing 
the  gas  flow  into  the  source,  even  if  the  ion  heating 
rate  is  higher  for  the  lower  electron  temperatures  – 
the  higher  heating  rate  is  over-compensated  by  the 
decreasing potential dip  value and  by  the  decreasing 
time  of  ion  confinement  in  the  plasma.  For  oxygen 
and  nitrogen,  the  ion  temperature  is  increasing  with 
the gas flow: decrease of the dip is not so pronounced 
for  these  plasmas  and  the  ion  heating  rate  is  mainly 
determined by dissociation of the molecules. 

 In  contrast  to  oxygen,  currents  of  the  moderately 
charged  nitrogen  ions  do  not  saturate  with  lowering 

the electron temperature, reaching 2 mA for N5+. This 
difference  is  due  to  the  relatively  faster  decrease  of 
the  ionization rates  for production of highly charged

Dependence  of  the  extracted  Kr18+  current  on  the

the  mix  with  oxygen 
(Kr=15%  and  O=85%)  is  shown  in  Fig.4.  The 
coupled power is set to 500 W here, and we mention 
again  that  variations  in  the  electron  temperature  are 
directly  connected  to  the  variations  in  the  gas  flow 
into the source; higher temperature corresponds to the 
lower  gas  flow  and  to  the  lower  total  electron/ion 
fluxes out of the plasma.  

Dependence  of  the  extracted  krypton  ions  on  the 
coupled  microwave  power  is  shown  in  Fig.5.  Here, 
values of the Kr18+ current are shown for the krypton 
plasma (Kr=100%) at the electron temperature of 16 
keV.  Also,  the  currents  are  shown  for  the  mixed 
electron 
plasma 
temperature of 12 keV. Both for the pure krypton and 
mixed plasmas the current saturates at around 700 W 
of  the  coupled  power.  At  the  high  powers  the  ion 
current  in  the  mix  substantially  exceeds  the  current 
from the non-mixed plasma.

As we see in Fig.4, the current of Kr18+ ions from the 
plasma  with  the  above-mentioned  mix  ratio  is 
maximized at 12 keV, while in the krypton discharge 
with  O=0%  this  current  reaches  the  maximum  at  16 
keV. 

Maximal currents for the krypton and mixed plasmas 
differ not so much as when comparing the currents at 
the  same  electron  temperature  of  12  keV.  Still,  the 
current  of  Kr18+  in  the  plasma  with  the  optimized 
electron temperature and oxygen content is higher by 
~15%  compared  to  the  maximum  in  the  non-mixed 
krypton  discharge.  We  note  here  that  the  electron 
losses out of the plasma are calculated without taking 
into  account  the  losses  caused  by  the  plasma  micro-
instabilities, which may seriously degrade the source 
performance at the highest electron temperatures: the 
instability is influenced by the temperature anisotropy 
along  and  perpendicular  to  the  magnetic  field  lines, 
which increases  with the electron temperature.  Also, 
there  is  a  great  uncertainty  in  the  rate  of  electron

plasmas  varies  slowly  with  the  RF  power,  with  the

this  decrease  of  the  electron  confinement  time.  The 
relative importance of the RF-induced losses remains 
constant  when  comparing  the  plasmas  with  the 
coupled  power  of  500  W  and  1000  W,  being  at  the 
level  of  0.3  of  the  total  electron  losses,  while  the 
absolute value of the RF loss frequency increases by 
30%. The increase of the electron losses is caused by

between  oxygen  and  krypton  densities  is  5.3  for  the 
oxygen  content  of  95%,  while  the  ratio  between  the 
gas  flows  is  63  in  these  conditions.  This  is  an 
indication of an increased krypton ion confinement at 
high oxygen content.  

In  the  following,  we  present  the  data  obtained  with 
the  fixed  power  of  500  W.  The  selection  is  a  rather 
arbitrary: the calculated extracted current of O6+ ions 
is at the level of around 1 mA at this power, close to 
what is measured with the DECRIS-SC2 source when 
injected  microwave  power  is  600  W.    As  it  is 
discussed in [11], the calculated value of the coupled 
power  as  it  is  used  in  our  model  can  substantially

1.  Mix with oxygen 

Dependence  of  the  extracted  Kr18+  ions  on  the  mix 
ratio is shown in Fig.6. The currents are calculated at 
the  electron  temperature  of  12  keV.  The  oxygen 
content  is  varied  from  0  to  100%.  Current  of  the 
krypton  ions  drops  by  factor  of  ~2  when  small 
amount (5-10%) of oxygen is added to the discharge, 
then it grows up and is maximized at 85% of oxygen 
content.  For  the  oxygen  content  above  the  optimal 
value the current of krypton ions decreases fast. 

When  changing  the  oxygen  content,  gas  flows  of 
krypton and oxygen vary almost linearly. The  fluxes 
are shown in Fig.7 for the same plasma parameters as 
in Fig.6. For the krypton plasma (with no oxygen) the 
gas flow is 0.2 p-mA, for the oxygen plasma (with no 
krypton) the flow is 1.2 p-mA. The current of Kr18+ is 
maximized when the oxygen flux is much higher than 
the  krypton  flux; the ratio between the  fluxes  is ~14 
for the oxygen content of 85%. 

The ion density of krypton ions varies with changing 
the oxygen content slower than the gas flow. In Fig.8, 
the  mean  ion  densities  of  krypton  and  oxygen  ions 
inside the ECR volume are shown as a function of the 
oxygen content. 

Even for the small krypton content, the mean density 
of  krypton  ions  is  comparable  with  the  density  of 
oxygen  ions  inside  the  ECR  volume:  the  ratio

oxygen  contents.  For  oxygen  ions,  the  mean  charge

krypton  content  in  the  wide  range  down  to  Kr=5% 
being at the level of ~(2+), much lower compared to 
the  pure  oxygen  plasma  (Kr=0%),  for  which  it  is 
close to (4+). For the krypton ions, their mean charge 
state is increasing when adding more oxygen into the 
plasma and reaches (14+) at Kr=5%, almost doubling 
compared to the pure krypton plasma case.

the flux of oxygen, the frequency of electron-krypton 
collisions  is  ~0.9  of  the  total  electron-ion  scattering 
frequency. As it is following from Eq.5, the electron-
ion frequency scales as ~Q2, where Q is an ion charge 
state. Even with having the relatively small densities, 
the  krypton  ions  scatter  the  plasma  electrons  more 
frequently because of their high charge states. 

The  increased  oxygen  content  leads  both  to  increase 
of  the  potential  dip  value  and  to  increase  of  the  ion 
temperatures.  Dependencies  of  Δφ  and  temperature 
of  Kr17+  ions  inside  the  ECR  volume  are  shown  in 
Fig.10,  as  well  as  a  ratio  between  the  dip  and  ion 
temperature  Δφ/Ti(Kr17+).  The  charge  state  (17+)  is 
selected  because 
ions  are  a  source  for 
production  of  Kr18+  ions  and  we  are  mainly  focused 
on the extracted currents of Kr18+ ions in our analysis.

The  dip  is  growing  faster  than  the  ion  temperatures 
resulting  in  the  increasing  ratio  Δφ/Ti(Kr17+)  and  in 
stronger ion confinement. 

More details of changes in ion confinement are given 
in Fig.11, where the confinement time of Kr17+ ions is 
plotted as a function of the oxygen content. The time 
is  calculated  by  using  Eq.2;  fast  increase  in  the 
confinement time is seen. The time is increased by a 
factor of almost three at the optimized mix of O=85% 
compared  to  the  krypton  plasma.  It  is  also  seen  that 
injection  of  small  amount  of  oxygen  results  in  a 
decrease of ion confinement time by around 30%. 

Dependence  of  the  ion  confinement  time  is  fitted  in 
Fig.11 with the “Ronglien-Cutler”-type curve:

When the oxygen content is high, potential dip starts 
to  be  large  enough  to  retard  most  of  the  energetic

The  drop  in  the  extracted  krypton  ions  (Fig.6)  and 
decreased  ion  confinement  times  at  low  oxygen 
content in the interval O=(5-25)% can be understood 
by analyzing the ion pressure profiles. 

In  Fig.12,  dependencies  of  ion  pressure  on  z-
coordinate  along  the  source  axis  are  shown  for 
different  oxygen  contents  of  0  and  5%.  The  profiles 

are  calculated  as

,  where 

summation  is  done  for  all  ions  of  the  specific 
element,  krypton  or  oxygen.  The  dashed  lines 
indicate the ECR zone positions. For all plasmas, the 
ion pressure decreases fast outside the ECR zone both 
in  directions  to  the  injection  and  extraction  sides  of 
the  source (injection side is at z=0). For the  krypton 
plasma  (O=0%)  the  profile  is  a  rather  flat  inside  the 
ECR  zone,  while  for  the  relatively  low  oxygen 
content  of  5%  the  profile  of  krypton  ion  pressure  is 
hollow at the source center. At the same time, oxygen 
ion pressure is peaked at the center.  

Ion  density  of  oxygen  is  small  compared  to  the 
density of krypton ions at this small oxygen content, 
but the oxygen pressure is comparable to the krypton 
pressure because of high energies of the oxygen ions. 
The  oxygen  ions  push  the  krypton  ions  toward  the

We  are  not  aware  about  the  direct  experimental 
measurements  of  how  small  amounts  of  oxygen 
influence  the  source  output  for  the  heavy  elements. 
The  indirect  confirmation  of  the  effect  can  be  that 
any ECRIS should be conditioned after breaking the 
vacuum  to  reach  a  good  source  performance.  Apart 
from  changing  the  source  chamber  wall  conditions, 
the  source  conditioning  can  be  connected  with  the 
process of removing the residual oxygen and nitrogen 
molecules out of the source. 

We  see  from  Fig.10  that  the  potential  dip  value 
decreases  substantially  when  small  flux  of  krypton 
atoms  is  injected  into  the  plasma  –  krypton  content 
Kr=5% leads to the Δφ decrease from 1.1 to 0.58 V. 
The  result  is  a  loss  of  confinement  for  oxygen  ions 
and decrease in the extracted oxygen currents for the 
high  charge  states.  In  Fig.13,  the  charge  state 
distributions  for  oxygen  are  shown  for  oxygen 
plasma  O=100%  and  for  the  krypton-oxygen  mix 
Kr=5%, O=95%. The current of O6+ decreases by an 
order of magnitude. 

Ion temperatures are not the same for different charge 
states of ions. The general tendency is an increase of 
the  ion  temperature  with  the  ion  charge  state, 
especially  pronounced 
the  mixed  plasmas.

Dependences of the temperatures on the charge state 
are shown in Fig.14 for the krypton plasma Kr=100%

plasma, the ion temperatures are changing by a factor 
of two comparing the lowly charged (1+) and highly 
charged (20+) ions. For the mixed plasma, the span in 
the  ion  temperatures  is  much  higher,  with  the 
temperature  of  Kr1+  ions  of  around  0.2  eV  and  of  3 
eV  for  Kr20+.  This  is  an  indication  of  different  ion 
confinement  times  and  different  rates  of  ion  energy 
changes in electron-ion/ion-ion collisions. 

is  seen  for  the  high  charge  states  above  10+.  In  the 
mix,  confinement  times  of  krypton  ions  are  much 
higher  compared  to  the  non-mixed  krypton  plasma; 
the  gain  is  around  factor  of  ~4.  In  the  same 
conditions,  confinement  times  of  oxygen  ions  is 
much smaller than the times for the krypton ions with 
the  same  charge  states, 
the  higher 
temperatures and the higher mobility of oxygen ions.

The dependencies are fitted with the Rognlien-Cutler

as the lines. The fitting coefficient is the same for all 
curves, A=0.74 m, close to what is calculated for the 
dependence  in  Fig.11.  It  is  seen  that  the  fit  greatly 
over-estimates  the  confinement  times  for  the  lowly 
charged  ions  both  in  the  mixed  (Q~1+-2+)  and  non-
mixed  plasmas  (Q<10+).  Good  correspondence 
between  the  calculated  times  and  the  fit  is  obtained 
for  the  highly  charged  krypton  ions  in  the  mixed

There 
is  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between  mixed  Kr-O  plasmas  with  injection  of  light 
16O and  heavy  18O isotopes. When  using nitrogen as 
the  mix  gas,  current  of  Kr18+  is  smaller  than  in  the 
oxygen  mix.  Also,  both  potential  dip  and  the  ion 
temperatures  are  smaller.  The  ion  confinement  time 
for  Kr17+  ions  with  the  admixed  nitrogen  is  higher 
than in oxygen mix, as well as the ratio between the 
Δφ/Ti(Kr17+) values (0.155 for the nitrogen and 0.147 
for  the  oxygen  mix).  Ions  are  colder  in  the  Kr-N 
plasma because of two main reasons: smaller kinetic 
energy release after ionization of nitrogen  molecules 
and  larger  contribution  of  the  suprathermal  nitrogen 
atoms  into  the  production  of  the  lowly  charged 
nitrogen  ions  in  the  dense  parts  of  the  ECR  plasma. 
The  ions  that  are  produced  from  the  suprathermal 
nitrogen  atoms  have  the  relatively  low  energies  and 
cool  the  ion  population.  For  nitrogen  we  use  small 
recombination 
the 
molecular  nitrogen  after  atom  collisions  with  the 
walls.  Calculations  with  the  same  recombination 
coefficient as  for oxygen (0.5) give the potential dip 
value  of  0.37  V  comparable  with  the  value  for  the 
oxygen  mix.  Still,  the  extracted  Kr18+  current  is 
smaller  in  these  conditions  compared  to  the  oxygen 
mix. 

for  production 

coefficient 

What makes the oxygen-mixed plasma more efficient 
for  production  and  extraction  of  the  highly  charged 
ions  of  krypton  is  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  ion 
densities,  which  is  hollow  but  more  concentrated 
toward the source axis compared to the nitrogen case. 

Indeed,  in  the  oxygen  plasma  the  mean  electron 
density  seen  by  the  krypton  highly  charged  ions  is 
larger  by  ~10%  compared  to  the  nitrogen  plasma. 
The  ion  distribution  at  the  extraction  electrode  is 
more  peaked  at  the  source  axis  -  more  ions  pass 
through  the  extraction  aperture.  Ion  densities  at  the 
middle  of  the  source  along  x-axis  are  plotted  in 
Fig.16 for oxygen and nitrogen mixes, as well as for 
the  non-mixed  krypton  plasma,  for  all  krypton  ions 
with Q≥17+. 

The plasma spatial profile is defined by the ambipolar 
diffusion of particles across the magnetic field due to 
the electron-ion collisions and by the spatial diffusion 
of ions caused by the unlike elastic ion-ion collisions 
[11]. The plasma shape depends, among other factors, 
on the spatial gradients of the magnetic field, plasma 
composition and ion temperatures. Hotter ions in the 
oxygen-krypton plasma make the profile broader than 
in the relatively colder nitrogen-krypton mix. For the 
non-mixed krypton plasma, the profile is the sharpest 
and  the  ion  densities  are  smallest  compared  to  the 
mixed plasmas.  

We  note  here  that  the  densities  are  connected  to  the 
extracted  ion  currents  with  a  scaling  factor  equal  to 
the  ion  confinement  time  (Ii~ni/τi)  and  the  ion 
confinement  times  are  smaller  for  the  non-mixed 
plasma. The extracted ion currents differ not so much 
as  the  ion  densities  when  comparing  the  mixed  and 
non-mixed plasmas. 

 
 
  
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 

Combination of the three-dimensional calculations of 
ion  dynamics  in  the  ECRIS  plasma  and  the  plasma-
averaged  calculations  of  electron  confinement  times 
allows reproducing the plasma parameters both in the 
single-gas and gas-mixed discharges. The gas mixing 
effect  is  seen  for  mixing  krypton  with  some  lighter 
gases; the  highest  gains in the currents of the  highly 
charged  krypton  ions  are  for  the  mix  with  oxygen. 
The  reasons  for  the  effect  are  due  to  increase  of  the 
potential  dip  that  confines  the  ions  inside  the  dense 
parts of the ECRIS plasma. Ionization of oxygen and 
nitrogen  molecules  results  in  the  energization  of  the 
singly  charged  ions  produced  after  the  molecule 
dissociation.  Temperature  of  krypton  ions  increases 
in the  mixed plasma  because  of the  extra heating by 
the  energetic  lowly  charged  ions  of  the  mixing  gas, 
improved  ion  confinement  and  boost  in  the  heating 
rate  by the electron-ion collisions  with the increased 
mean  charge  state  of  ions.  Changes  in  the  spatial 
distribution of ions in the plasma are seen in the mix. 
Drop of the highly charged ion currents of the lighter 
element  is  observed  when  adding  small  fluxes  of 
krypton.  The  drop  is  caused  by  accumulation  of  the 
krypton  ions  inside  the  plasma,  which  decreases  the 
potential dip and the electron/ion confinement times.

Fig.16.  Density  of  the  krypton  ions  with  the  charge 
states  greater  and  equal  to  (17+)  along  x-axis  in  the 
middle  of  the  source  (z=14  cm)  for  the  mix  with 
oxygen  (O=85%,  black),  nitrogen  (N=85%,  red)  and 
with no mix (Kr=100%, blue).  

Neon is the best among the  mixing noble gases, still 
providing  much  smaller  currents  of  krypton  highly 
charged ions and smaller potential dip values than in 
the oxygen and nitrogen mixes. Argon and helium are 
less effective as the mixing gases compared to neon, 
with the helium mix resulting in the smallest potential 
dip values and smallest current of Kr18+ ions.
