Employing the G0W0 approximation of Hedin’s GW approach one can obtain quasi-particle ener-
gies of extended systems and molecules with good accuracy. However, for many materials, semi-local
exchange-correlation functionals are unsatisfactory starting points for G0W0 calculations. Hybrid
functionals often improve upon them, but at a substantially higher computational cost. As an al-
ternative, we suggest the LDA-1/2 method, which provides reasonable band gaps, without being
computationally involved.
In this work, we systematically compare 3 starting points for G0W0:
LDA, PBE0, and LDA-1/2. A selection of solids is chosen for this benchmark: C, Si, SiC, AlP, LiF,
MgO, Ne, Ar, GaN, GaAs, CdS, ZnS, and ZnO. We demonstrate that LDA-1/2 is a good starting
point in most cases, reducing the mean absolute error of band gaps by 50% when compared to the
other 2 functionals.

INTRODUCTION

A major goal of ﬁrst-principles calculations is to re-
in order to
liably predict the properties of materials,
guide the design of new materials, or to better under-
stand the behavior of those already available. Describing
single-particle excitations well is among the key elements
when it comes to materials for optoelectronic applica-
tions. The more accurately these properties are obtained
from ﬁrst-principles calculations, the better these calcu-
lations can explain experiments, provide insight, or pro-
pose new materials with improved properties.1,2 The GW
approach3 of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)
has become a standard framework to calculate single-
particle excitations in solids.4–6 In its original formula-
tion by Hedin, a set of coupled integro-diﬀerential equa-
tions needs to be solved self-consistently to determine the
single-particle Green function, and, from its poles, the
single-particle excitation energies. On the other hand, in
the more pragmatic single-shot approximation, G0W0,
the self-consistency is abandoned and Hedin’s equations
are solved up to ﬁrst iteration. In this case, a well-deﬁned
set of wavefunctions and eigenvalues is employed as the
starting point, in order to obtain a new set of eigenvalues
including quasi-particle (QP) corrections.

The simplest starting point from Kohn-Sham (KS) cal-
culations is the local density approximation (LDA). QP
energies obtained by G0W0 on top of LDA (G0W0@LDA)
are in good agreement with experiments, especially for
sp3 bonded materials.4,7 Nevertheless, particularly for
materials containing d or f electrons, LDA turns out
to be an inadequate starting point. For such materials
G0W0@LDA fails (even qualitatively) due to the intrinsic

lack of localization of LDA wavefunctions.7–9 Overall, de-
spite the success of G0W0@LDA, this approximation un-
derestimates band gaps by a slight amount in some cases,
but substantially in others.10 In fact, only if the underly-
ing KS results are close to the quasiparticle eigenvalues,
the perturbative treatment is well justiﬁed, and often this
is not the case for semi-local exchange-correlation (XC)
functionals.

Self-consistent GW is expected to be more accurate
and independent of the starting point, as in the original
formulation of Hedin.3 Obviously, it is computationally
much more involved. An alternative is to remain in the
framework of G0W0, but to change to a better start-
ing point.2,11–13 An eﬀective choice is often presented by
hybrid functionals, which combine a fraction of Hartree-
Fock exchange with semi-local functionals. For instance,
G0W0 evaluated on top of hybrid functionals improves
upon G0W0@LDA in terms of accuracy.11,12,14 A major
disadvantage, however, is the computational cost, as hy-
brid functionals may be two orders of magnitude more
expensive than LDA.15,16 An additional drawback is that
there is no universal mixing parameter for the fraction of
the Hartree-Fock exchange. Although some systematic
ways of ﬁnding it have been proposed,2,9,13,17–21 they are
still material dependent to some extent.18–20,22,23

In this manuscript, we address the issue of a good and
at the same time eﬃcient starting point for G0W0 and
evaluate the LDA-1/2 method for this purpose.24–26 It
implements Slater’s transition state technique27–30 for
solids. The LDA-1/2 method improves (over LDA)
in terms of band gaps, band alignments, and defect
levels.26,31–35 To assess whether the LDA-1/2 method is
a suitable starting point for G0W0 calculations, we com-

solids, we study band gaps, the position of d levels, and
band structures, confronting G0W0 calculations, based
on these three distinct starting points, with each other
and with experimental data.

II. METHODS

While PBE0 requires a generalized KS (gKS)
scheme,22,36 LDA-1/2 stays within the local KS frame-
work. It is based on Janak’s theorem,37 and on the as-
sumption of a linear behavior of the KS eigenvalues with
their occupation.38 With these premises, the ionization
energy I can be expressed as the negative highest oc-
cupied KS eigenvalue, −εv(1/2), with half-occupation.
Accordingly, the electron aﬃnity is equal to the negative
lowest unoccupied KS eigenvalue, −εc(1/2), with half-
occupation. The band gap, Eg, therefore, is just the
diﬀerence between these two half-occupied eigenvalues.
However, instead of performing calculations with half-
occupied KS orbitals, in the LDA-1/2 method, a so-called
“self-energy potential”, VS, is subtracted from the LDA
XC potential, vXC. The new KS potential provides eigen-
values εv and εc which are equal to those which would
be obtained with the “half-ionizing” procedure. The local
potential VS can be approximated from atomic calcula-
tions as a diﬀerence between the atomic KS potential of
the neutral and the half-ionized atom, for each species in
the crystal.24,25 This procedure implements the idea pro-
posed by Slater of creating a localized hole which could
act in solids in the same way as the “half-ionizing” tech-
nique works for atoms and molecules.24,25,28–30 The self-
energy potential can indeed remedy the delocalization
error of charge densities in LDA, and therefore amelio-
rates the quality of KS eigenvalues.39 More details about
the method itself and its derivation can be found in Refs.
24 and 25.

After the (g)KS calculations, QP corrected eigenvalues

G0W0 approximation, as follows:

cupied states in the G0W0 approach.6,41,42 To keep the
computational cost reasonable, we initially perform cal-
culations with a 4 × 4 × 4 k grid to reach convergence
regarding the number of empty states N (which is var-
ied from 100 up to a maximum of 300 or 600, depending
on the material).6,41 The band gap is then extrapolated
according to the expression6,41

tions with respect to the number of empty states and the
number of k points, following the procedure proposed
in Refs. 6 and 41. Local orbitals are included in our

To benchmark the quality of the starting point, we
choose the following solids: C, Si, SiC, AlP, LiF, MgO,
Ne, Ar, GaN, GaAs, CdS, ZnS, and ZnO. In each case,
and for each starting point, we obtain the band gap, the
position of d levels (in case they are present), and the
band structure, comparing our calculations with experi-
mental data. These materials are studied in zinc blende

systems, we employ experimental lattice parameters.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our calculated band gaps are presented in Table I and
compared with experimental data from the literature.
For this purpose, we remove from the measured band
gaps the contributions due to spin-orbit (SO) coupling
and zero-point renormalization energy (ZPE). Values ob-
tained this way are marked by a star. Special attention
must be paid to the corrections arising from the ZPE.
It quantiﬁes the electron-phonon coupling strength, and
is specially important for semiconductors composed by
light elements, such as those from the second period. For
instance, for diamond the ZPE is as high as 0.6 eV.8 The
ZPE has been pointed out in the literature as the most
important source of discrepancies between experiments
and calculations, which usually do not take this eﬀect
into account.10,17,43,56–59 For the solids addressed here,
only for GaAs, which contains the heaviest anion, spin-
orbit coupling has a higher contribution to the renormal-
ization of the band gap than the ZPE.

A. Band gaps from (generalized) Kohn-Sham
calculations

In Fig. 2 (a), we plot the (g)KS band gaps given in Ta-
ble I. The errors corresponding to each (g)KS approach
are presented in Fig. 2 (b). Obviously, this ﬁgure reﬂects
the typical underestimation by LDA, where semiconduc-
tors with d electrons, such as ZnO, GaN, GaAs, ZnS, and
CdS, appear among those with the highest discrepancy.
The corresponding d levels are not suﬃciently localized
in LDA and tend to be placed too high in energy, pushing
the top of valence band (VB) upward.17,60

Employing PBE0 improves

substantially, as cal-
culated band gaps become considerably closer
to
experiment.17,18,61–63 However, the accuracy of PBE0 is
highly related to the band gap itself – as it can be veriﬁed
in Fig. 2 (b). For larger band gaps, an underestimation is
observed, and the reverse occurs for narrower band gaps.
This agrees with previous observations.17,61 According
to our calculations, the optimal interval, with smallest
errors, lies between ∼ 3 and 7 eV.

The LDA-1/2 method performs considerably better
than LDA, and its accuracy is comparable with PBE0.
Although overall LDA-1/2 still tends to underestimate
band gaps, similar to PBE0 for compounds with large
band gaps, it ﬁxes the underestimation present in LDA,
enhancing substantially the agreement experiment.

A statistical measure of the quality of LDA, PBE0, and
LDA-1/2 in predicting band gaps is obtained by a linear
ﬁt, y = γx, of the data displayed in Fig. 2 (a). The
closer γ is to 1, the better the calculations can reproduce
experimental data. In Table II, we show the results of

3

this linear ﬁt. Naturally, LDA provides the worst agree-
ment with experiment, while LDA-1/2 and PBE0 exhibit
almost the same slope. From these preliminary observa-
tions, we can already anticipate that LDA-1/2 should be
better than LDA as starting point for G0W0 calculations,
and probably as satisfactory as PBE0.

B. Band gaps from G0W0 based on diﬀerent
starting points

In Fig. 3 (a), we compare band gaps calculated within
the G0W0 approximation based on diﬀerent reference
(g)KS hamiltonians with experimental ones. The agree-
ment between theory and experiment is better assessed
by a linear ﬁt y = γx through the points presented in Fig.
3. Table II displays the corresponding slopes. The best
agreement with experiment is reached when LDA-1/2 is
employed as starting point for G0W0. We shall resume
this.

dependence1,2,11,12,17,64–68 in a quantitative way. Al-
though the improvement over LDA is already very im-
pressive, G0W0@LDA still systematically underestimates
band gaps, as already observed in the literature.10,14,47,50
On the other hand, G0W0@PBE0 overestimates them,
Ne being an exception. This agrees with previous
investigations,17,69 although for molecules, results of
G0W0@PBE0 for the highest occupied molecular orbital
show much better agreement with experiments.12,70 Like
for PBE0, the accuracy of G0W0@PBE0 highly correlates
with the band gap: the larger the band gap, the better
it is. In comparison with G0W0@LDA, there is no over-
all advantage of G0W0@PBE0. However, the latter is in
better agreement with experiments for materials with d
electrons, i.e., ZnO, GaN, GaAs, ZnS, CdS. Nevertheless,
for these materials, except for GaAs, band gaps obtained
with PBE0 are even better than the ones obtained with
G0W0@PBE0.

G0W0@PBE0 for almost all the materials. ZnO is a par-
ticular case that attracts our attention. This oxide has
been a long-standing issue of G0W0 calculations on top
of semi-local functionals.17,41,43,71,72 The band gap ob-
tained with LDA-1/2, 3.18 eV, is in much better agree-
ment with the experimental gap of 3.36 eV, than the one
calculated with LDA, 0.62 eV. While G0W0@LDA leads
to a band gap of 2.66 eV, which is still substantially un-
derestimated, G0W0@LDA-1/2 practically does not alter
the value obtained with its starting point. The situation
is diﬀerent for PBE0 and G0W0@PBE0. The band gap
obtained with PBE0, 3.09 eV, is already very close to the
experimental one, but G0W0@PBE0 deteriorates this re-
sult by overestimating it.

Figure 4 depicts the mean absolute error (MAE), giv-
ing an overview of the accuracy reached by each method.

PBE0 and LDA-1/2 have a MAE of 15.2% and 12.9%,
respectively, which are less than half of the MAE of
LDA, 46.8%. The LDA-1/2 method itself, despite being
a method with a local KS potential, has a MAE compa-
rable to G0W0@LDA(9.1%) and G0W0@PBE0 (10.0%).

It is impressive that the MAE of G0W0@LDA-1/2, of
3.9%, is less than half of the values of G0W0@LDA and
G0W0@PBE0.

We further address the accuracy of LDA-1/2 in Fig.

It is interesting to know the cases
when one can avoid the G0W0 step. Figure 5 suggests
that LDA-1/2 agrees better with G0W0@LDA-1/2 for
small band gaps. To quantify this assessment, a linear
ﬁt y = γx is performed. For band gaps ranging from 0
to 10 eV, γ is found to be 0.88 ± 0.02, closer to 1, when
compared to the range 0 to 25 eV, when a is equal to
0.84 ± 0.02. This means that for compounds with band
gaps between 0 and 10 eV, calculations with LDA-1/2
lead to band gaps which are on average roughly 90% of
the values obtained with G0W0@LDA-1/2. This provides
a measure of the extent up to which LDA-1/2 can approx-
imate G0W0@LDA-1/2.

d -band positions

Among the solids chosen for our benchmark, only ZnO,
GaN, GaAs, ZnS, and CdS have d bands. Whereas ZnO,
ZnS, and CdS exhibit shallow d states located 7-9 eV
below the VB maximum (VBM),73–76 they are deeper
in GaN and GaAs, i.e., 17-19 eV below the VBM.75,77

Figure 4. Overview of how the MAE is decreased after intro-
ducing QP corrections. On the left side, band gaps, and on
the right side, d levels. An error bar of 10% is depicted in
gray in the background.

We determine the position of these bands as an average
among the corresponding eigenvalues at the Γ point, and
compare our results with measurements reported in the
literature. In Fig. 6, we display the diﬀerences between
calculations and experiments. A negative (positive) value
means that the respective method places the d states too
high (low) in energy.

No substantial diﬀerences are observed between LDA
and LDA-1/2. PBE0,
in contrast, places d levels at
lower energies than LDA and LDA-1/2. The agreement
with experiments is clearly better, due to the inclusion of
Hartree-Fock exchange, as expected also from a previous
investigation with the exact exchange functional.78

QP corrections on the G0W0 level push the position of

introduces in the KS equations. This helps to heal the
delocalization error present in LDA.

The fact that d states obtained with LDA and LDA-
1/2 are not diﬀerent is not surprising. The LDA-1/2
method employs Slater’s transition state technique to im-
prove the description of the VBM and conduction band
minimum (CBM), and the results from sections III A and
III B conﬁrm that this goal is really achieved. Conversely,
for states far apart from the VBM and CBM, such as
the d levels we are considering here, LDA-1/2 is not ex-
pected to have the same eﬃciency simply because it was
not designed to do so. However, we stress that, although
the position of d levels obtained with LDA and LDA-1/2
is basically the same, G0W0@LDA-1/2 is more accurate
than G0W0@LDA. While the MAE of G0W0@LDA is
11.4%, the MAE of G0W0@LDA-1/2 is 8.4%.

At this point, it is worthwhile to comment about ZnO.
The position of the d levels is wrongly predicted by LDA
with a relative error of more than 30%, the largest one
among all the 5 compounds with d electrons addressed in
this paper. G0W0@LDA, although improving over LDA,
still places d bands incorrectly with a relatively high error
of 20%. PBE0 gives rise to better results than LDA, even
though the relative error still remains as high as 17%.
In G0W0@PBE0, the error is decreased to 6%. Finally,
while the LDA-1/2 method exhibits the same error as
LDA, in G0W0@LDA-1/2, the position of d levels is in
better agreement with the experimental one.

D. Band structures

Figure 7. Band structure of CdS. Calculations within (g)KS
schemes on the left, and including G0W0 corrections on the
right. At the top (bottom), unoccupied (occupied) bands are
shown, with the CBM (VBM) placed at zero.

Figure 5. Comparison between band gaps obtained with
LDA-1/2 and G0W0@LDA-1/2. The dotted line shows the
ideal case, where LDA-1/2 could replace G0W0@LDA-1/2.

Figure 6. Relative error of calculated d-band positions, com-
pared to experiments. On the left side, results obtained within
a (g)KS framework; on the right side, calculations including
QP corrections. Experimental data were taken from Refs. 73
and 74 (wurtzite ZnO), Ref. 77 (GaN), Ref. 75 (GaAs and
ZnS), Ref. 76 (CdS).

d bands down when compared to the underlying start-
ing point, improving the agreement with experiments.
This is evident from Fig.
4, where the MAE is de-
picted. G0W0@PBE0 predicts the positions of d states
with the highest accuracy, in other words, PBE0 repre-
sents for this purpose the best starting point for G0W0.
The improvement of G0W0@LDA and G0W0@LDA-1/2
over their respective starting points is notable. Although
d levels are wrongly positioned by both LDA and LDA-
1/2, only G0W0@LDA-1/2 can cure this deﬁciency. We
attribute this to the more localized LDA-1/2 wavefunc-
tions, caused by the attractive potential which LDA-1/2

on the band structures obtained within G0W0. CdS and
MgO are chosen as examples. We highlight the diﬀer-
ences among the band structures obtained within LDA,
PBE0, and LDA-1/2, as well as among G0W0 results for
the case of CdS in Fig. 7 and for MgO in Fig. 8.

Figure 8. Same as Fig. 7, but for MgO.

From Figs. 7 and 8, we see that, considering CdS (or
MgO, accordingly), the shape of the VB calculated within
LDA and PBE0 is essentially the same, and is not altered
by QP corrections on the G0W0 level. The LDA-1/2
method, in turn, deforms the VB, decreasing its band-
width in 0.8 and 1.2 eV for CdS and MgO, respectively.
The right shape is recovered by G0W0@LDA-1/2, which
agrees with G0W0@LDA and G0W0@PBE0.

Even though the d levels of cadmium are better ob-
tained with PBE0 than with LDA and LDA-1/2, the
semicore 3s state of sulfur is better described by the latter

7

methods. As can be seen in Fig. 7, LDA and LDA-1/2
place these states around −12 eV, in agreement with the
position obtained with G0W0. In the case of MgO, a sim-
ilar situation occurs for the 2s states of oxygen. LDA and
LDA-1/2 place these levels between −15.6 and −17.0 eV,
while PBE0 places them between −17.2 and −18.8 eV.
G0W0 bands agree with the position obtained by LDA
and LDA-1/2.

The shape of the CB is similar in all three (g)KS
schemes. LDA-1/2 does not diminish its band width as
much as for the VB.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we propose and investigate a new starting
point for G0W0 calculations – the LDA-1/2 method. To
benchmark the performance of LDA-1/2, also LDA and
PBE0 have been examined as starting points. For the
band gaps of the investigated materials, G0W0@LDA-
1/2 turns out to be the most accurate approach, leading
to predictions in very nice agreement with experiments.
In the case of d bands, PBE0 proves to be the best start-
ing point for G0W0 calculations. Anyway, G0W0@LDA-
1/2 results are closer to experiment when compared to
G0W0@LDA. Especially for materials with a small band
gap, the LDA-1/2 method alone, i.e., without a subse-
quent G0W0 calculation, achieves considerable accuracy
if one is interested in the band gap only. This scheme
can be useful when studying more complex materials,
such as interfaces, surfaces, or heterostructures, as G0W0
may come with a prohibitive computational cost in these
cases.
