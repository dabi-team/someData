Flavor transition mechanisms of supernova neutrinos during their propagation

deserve a close scrutiny. We present a method to determine whether Mikheyev-

Smirnov-Wolfenstein eﬀect indeed occurs or not when SN neutrinos propagate out-

ward from the SN core to the Earth. The non-MSW scenario for comparison is the

classical ﬂavor transition probability for neutrino propagation in the vacuum. Our

approach involves studying time evolution of neutrino event rates in both liquid ar-

gon and liquid scintillation detectors. The former (latter) detector is sensitive to νe

(¯νe) ﬂux which is a linear combination of νe (¯νe) and νµ,τ (¯νµ,τ ) ﬂuxes from the source

with the weighting of each component dictated by the ﬂavor transition mechanism.

Using currently available simulations for SN neutrino emissions, the time evolution

of νeAr and ¯νe IBD event rates and the corresponding cumulative event fractions

are calculated up to t = 100 ms in DUNE and JUNO detectors, respectively. It is

shown that the time dependence of cumulative event fraction in each detector and

their ratio can be used to discriminate diﬀerent ﬂavor transition scenarios of SN

neutrinos.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬂavor transition of SN neutrinos has been an attractive ﬁeld of research and motivated

numerous eﬀorts (See [1] for a review) on studying the neutrino ﬂavor changing eﬀect during

the gravitational core collapse of a massive star. Originating from deep inside the SN core,

neutrinos are expected to undergo signiﬁcant ﬂavor transitions as they propagate outward

from SN core to the terrestrial detectors. Due to MSW eﬀects [2, 3], νe (¯νe) ﬂux swap

with νµ,τ (¯νµ,τ ) ﬂuxes fully or partially when the neutrino vacuum oscillation frequency

 
 
 
 
 
 
√

ω = ∆m2/2E is of the order of the matter potential, λ =

√

2GF ne. Here ∆m2 denotes

one of the mass-squared diﬀerences, E the neutrino energy, and ne the net electron density.

For typical SN post-bounce matter proﬁles, this MSW-induced ﬂavor conversions occur at

distances of ∼ O(103) km from the SN core where ω (cid:39) λ [4].

2

In the deep region of the core where neutrino densities are large, the oﬀ-diagonal ν −

ν potential, µ ∼

2GF nν, arising from coherent ν − ν forward scatterings, may induce

collective pair ﬂavor oscillation νe¯νe ↔ νx¯νx with a frequency ∼

√

ωµ over the entire energy

range where x = µ, τ . Based on theoretical understanding and numerical calculations, large

collective ﬂavor conversions were predicted to occur at distances of ∼ O(102) km from the

SN core where ω (cid:39) µ [5–7].

Very close (∼ O(1) m) to the SN surface, the ν − ν potential may induce even faster

ﬂavor conversions at a rate ∼ µ than the above collective oscillation at a rate ∼

√

ωµ [8].

This fast ﬂavor conversion requires suﬃciently diﬀerent angular distributions for diﬀerent

neutrino ﬂavors [9–11]. Since the ﬂavor νx

1 decouples from matter earlier than ¯νe, and the

latter decouples earlier than νe, it can be expected that the radius of νe sphere, rνe, is larger

than that of ¯νe sphere, r¯νe, which in turn should be larger than rνx. Therefore, close to the

SN surface, rνe, the νx zenith-angle distribution would be more forward-peaked than that of

¯νe, which in turn would be more forward-peaked than the νe distribution.

Flavor transitions are expected to change ﬂavor compositions of primary SN neutrino

ﬂuxes, and consequently to leave imprints in neutrino events measured by terrestrial detec-

tors. This motivates us to study neutrino ﬂavor transitions with measurements of galactic

SN neutrinos arriving at the Earth. Unlike the status of MSW eﬀects, consensus on collec-

tive ﬂavor transitions has not yet been reached so that studies of collective ﬂavor transition

eﬀects on terrestrial SN neutrino ﬂuxes are few. Meanwhile, studying fast ﬂavor conversions

only started in recent years and is still far from a thorough understanding. Therefore, we

focus on examining MSW eﬀects in SN neutrinos. Based on the understanding that MSW

eﬀects are sensitive to neutrino mass hierarchy (NMH), many studies [12–19] are devoted

to probing NMH with SN neutrino events detected on the Earth. Naturally, these studies

all assume the occurrence of MSW eﬀects. In this paper, we however would like to examine

if MSW eﬀects indeed occur as SN neutrinos propagate outward from the SN core. To do

1 Hereafter νx refers to νµ,τ and ¯νµ,τ for convenience in notation.

3

this, we compare time dependencies of SN neutrino event rate predicted by MSW eﬀects

with those predicted by classical ﬂavor transition rates for neutrino propagation in vacuum.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy review possible ﬂavor transition

mechanisms of SN neutrinos as they propagate outward from SN core until reaching the

terrestrial detector. We then summarize SN neutrino ﬂuxes obtained from the simulated SN

neutrino data, which will be used in our later analysis. In Sec. III, we calculate event rates

of νeAr interactions for DUNE detector and ¯νe IBD event rates for JUNO detector under

diﬀerent ﬂavor transition mechanisms, taking a galactic SN burst at 5 kpc distance as a

benchmark example. In Sec. IV, we discuss the strategy of testing MSW eﬀects with νeAr

and ¯νe IBD event rates. Speciﬁcally we study the time dependencies of cumulative event

fractions in DUNE and JUNO detectors. We shall see that the time dependence of νeAr

cumulative event fraction is suﬃcient to separate MSW normal mass hierarchy from MSW

inverted mass hierarchy and vacuum ﬂavor transition. On the the hand, to discriminate the

latter two scenarios, it is necessary to invoke the cumulative event fraction of ¯νe IBD events.

Finally, in Sec. V we summarize our results and conclude.

II. SUPERNOVA NEUTRINO FLUX SPECTRA

A. Primary Neutrino Flux Spectra

A SN neutrino burst lasts for ∆t ≈ 10 s, during which the neutronization burst happens

at tpb ∼ (10−15) ms. Here, tpb denotes the post-bounce time. In our calculation, the primary

neutrino ﬂux spectra are extracted from SN simulations accounting for SNe with iron core.

Simulations of SN explosion have been pursued by diﬀerent groups. To demonstrate our

approach, we calculate expected SN neutrino event rates based upon neutrino emissions

simulated by four diﬀerent groups with respect to roughly similar progenitor masses. These

simulations are for progenitor masses of 8.8 M(cid:12) by Garching group [20], of 10 M(cid:12) by Burrow

et al. [21], of 11.2 M(cid:12) by Fischer et al. [22], and of 13 M(cid:12) by Nakazato et al. [23]. We note

that the simulations in Refs. [21, 23] cover many diﬀerent progenitor masses. The above

speciﬁc choices of progenitor masses are made for matching with studies of Refs. [20, 22].

Finally, we take the distance of galactic SN to the Earth as 5 kpc for a benchmark discussion.

The SN luminosity Lνα (erg/s) and emission rate nνα (1/s) curves are shown in Fig. 1,

4

in which, from left to right, are predicted by Garching simulation (simulation G), Burrow

et al.’s simulation (simulation B), Fischer et al.’s simulation (simulation F), and Nakazato

et al.’s simulation (simulation N). Clearly, the luminosity and emission curves predicted

by simulations G, B, and F are similar with each other while those of simulation N are

distinctive. In simulation N, the neutronization burst happens at tpb ∼ 10 ms with its full

width at half maximum of the luminosity ∆tN ∼ 30 ms while, in the other simulations, it

happens earlier with the width of ∆tN ∼ 10 ms. It is seen that the peak height is twice that

of the tail in simulation N while it is about 10 times in other simulations. To encompass

the whole duration of the neutronization burst, we perform our analysis for a time period

of ∆t = 100 ms from the start.

the neutrino propagation are well ﬁtted by the Keil parametrization [24], i.e.,

B. Neutrino Flux Spectra with Flavor Transitions

In this paper, we investigate whether or not the ﬂavor contents of SN neutrinos are

modiﬁed by the MSW eﬀect as they propagate outwards from deep inside a SN and ﬁnally

reaches the Earth. If MSW eﬀects do not occur, the ﬂavor contents of SN neutrinos arriving

on the Earth are incoherent superpositions of the mass eigenstates leaving from SN, which

can be written as

Fα(E, t) = PαβF 0

β (E, t),

α instead of F 0

να to denote the ﬂux spectra of να. This notation simpliﬁes

where the values of the mixing angles are taken from [26]. This scenario is the same as

astrophysical neutrinos traversing a long distance in vacuum before reaching the Earth. We

thus refer this scenario as vacuum ﬂavor transition (VFT).

Current measurements of mixing angles can be well-approximated by tri-bimaximal [27]

values so the neutrino ﬂux spectra observed on Earth can be approximated as 3

ν2 (¯ν2) is observed as a νe (¯νe) since neutrinos arrive at the Earth as mass eigenstates.

We do not consider the regeneration factor due to the Earth matter eﬀect and thus take

P2e = sin2 θ12. Numerically we have P2e

∼= 1/3.

From these equations, it is shown that, in the normal mass hierarchy, νe completely comes

III. EVENT RATES OF SN NEUTRINOS IN TERRESTRIAL DETECTORS

With neutrino ﬂuxes given above, we calculate event rates of SN neutrinos for all ﬂavors,

νe, ¯νe, and νx, for the vacuum ﬂavor transition (VFT) scenario and the case that the ﬂavor

contents are modiﬁed by MSW eﬀects as SN neutrinos propagate outward from the core. In

the latter case, both normal and inverted mass hierarchies are taken into consideration and

denoted as MSW-NH and MSW-IH scenarios, respectively. The event rates and quantities

induced from these rates are displayed in numbers per bin with a 5 ms bin width throughout

this article.

In liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPC), νe is the most easily detected species
via its charged-current interaction with argon nuclei, νe+40Ar → 40K∗+e−. The cross section

for this νeAr interaction has been computed in [28]. Numerical data compiled in [29] is used

for our calculations. Assuming a SN at a distance of 5 kpc, the event spectrum of νeAr in

DUNE [30] is given by

(cid:19)

(cid:18)d2NνeAr
dEe−dt

(cid:90)

∆t = NAr ·

dEνFe(Eν, t)∆t ·

dσνeAr(Eν, Ee−)
dEe−

,

(15)

where ∆t ≡ 5 ms is our chosen bin width, NAr is the number of target liquid Argon in DUNE

detector. Integrating the electron energy, we obtain νeAr number (dNνeAr/dt)∆t per 5 ms

as shown in Fig. 2. It is clearly seen that the time-dependence proﬁles of the event rates

for simulations G, B, and F are similar while the proﬁle for simulation N is rather diﬀerent

from the others.

For simulations G, B, and F, the peak event rates of VFT scenario are larger than those in

MSW scenarios, in which the peak event rates of IH are larger than those of NH. Hence the

ordering of peak event rates is VFT> MSW-IH>MSW-NH. This can be understood from

8

peak behaviors of Lνα and nνα shown in Fig. 1. We can see that Lνe(nνe) (cid:29) Lνx(nνx) in the
peak region so that Fe is approximately equal to 5F 0

x for VFT, MSW-IH
and MSW-NH scenarios, respectively. Such an ordering of peak νe ﬂux is expected to be

e /3, and F 0

e /9, F 0

preserved in the event rate level since the diﬀerence between (cid:104)Ee(cid:105) and (cid:104)Ex(cid:105) is not suﬃcient to

ﬂip the ordering. For the long tail region, F 0

x are both small and comparable to each
other so, after full or partial swap, event rates in diﬀerent scenarios are indistinguishable

e and F 0

with uncertainties taken into account.

For simulation N, the event rates in all scenarios show similar behaviors except on the

peak height and its timing. The peak of VFT scenario appears earlier than those of MSW

scenarios. On the other hand, the peak event rate of MSW NH scenario is the largest.

Here the ordering of peak event rates are diﬀerent because Lνx(nνx) is not so much smaller

than Lνe(nνe) as in the case of simulations G, B, and F. Furthermore the contribution of
F 0

x to νe event rate through the ﬂavor transition is enhanced due to relative large (cid:104)Eνx(cid:105) in
simulation N. For the tail region, simulation N also predicts roughly similar Fe for diﬀerent

ﬂavor transition scenarios. However, due to large (cid:104)Eνx(cid:105), the eventual tail event rates for
diﬀerent scenarios are determined by the fractions of F 0

x in Fe. These fractions are given by
Eqs. (6), (9), and (12), which predict the event rate ordering shown on the rightmost panel

of Fig. 2. It is seen that these event rates are much larger than those in simulations G, B,

and F, which is again caused by large (cid:104)Eνx(cid:105) that enhances the event rates.

FIG. 2: Event rates of νeAr in DUNE in diﬀerent ﬂavor transition scenarios. These

event rates are obtained for simulations G, B, F, and N with progenitor masses of

8.8 M(cid:12), 10 M(cid:12), 11.2 M(cid:12), and 13 M(cid:12) from left to right, respectively.

Table II presents the total event numbers obtained from the event rates shown in Fig. 2

for various SN neutrino detection channels. The ordering of total νeAr event number follows

that of the peak event rate, i.e., VFT> MSW-IH>MSW-NH for simulations G, B, and F

while MSW-NH> MSW-IH>VFT for simulation N.

Besides νeAr signals, SN neutrinos also interact in the following channels in LAr TPC
detectors: ν + e− → ν + e− and ¯νeAr charged-current interaction, ¯νe + 40Ar → 40Cl∗ + e+.

The event rates of these channels are sub-dominant compared to νeAr interactions (for

a reference, see Table II in [31] and Table I in [32]). Therefore, we only focus on νeAr

interactions.

In scintillation detectors, the spectrum of inverse beta decay (IBD) events is obtained by

measuring the positron energy deposit. The predicted event spectrum is given by

where Np is the number of target protons in the detector, and σIBD(Eν) is the IBD cross

section taken from [33]. The minimum neutrino energy for generating IBD interaction is

Emin = 1.8 MeV.

Integrating the positron energy, we obtain the IBD event per 5 ms,

(dNIBD/dt) · ∆t, in JUNO [34] as shown in Fig. 3.

IBD events are caused by ¯νe ﬂux. In simulation N, n¯νe is comparable to nνx as seen in

Fig. 1. MSW oscillation does not change the situation since it involves only the full swapping

(inverted mass hierarchy) or partial swapping (normal mass hierarchy) between ¯νe and νx.

On the other hand, the mean energy of νx is signiﬁcantly larger than that of ¯νe as described

in Table I. Since IBD cross section grows with the neutrino energy, the full and partial

swapping between ¯νe and νx in Eqs. (10) and (13) imply that IBD event rate in MSW-IH

scenario is larger than that of MSW-NH. In the VFT scenario, the fraction of ¯νe resulting

from the ﬂavor transition of νx at the source is between MSW-IH and MSW-NH. Hence IBD

These event rates are obtained for simulations G, B, F, and N with progenitor masses

of 8.8 M(cid:12), 10 M(cid:12), 11.2 M(cid:12), and 13 M(cid:12) from left to right, respectively.

event rates in simulation N follow the ordering MSW-IH>VFT>MSW-NH. For simulations

G, B, and F, it is seen that nνx > n¯νe in the earlier time. Hence in the earlier time the IBD

event rate in MSW-IH scenario is largest due to the complete swapping between νx and ¯νe.

IV. EXAMINING THE PRESENCE OF MSW EFFECTS

To characterize the sharp rise of νe ﬂux during the neutronization burst, we deﬁne cumu-

lative time distributions of SN neutrino signals for the time interval of interest t = (0−0.1) s

as in [15]

dencies of SN event rates, it is important to have an observational deﬁnition of the origin

of time. For example, although the characteristic event peak (driven by νe ﬂux) in both

VFT and MSW-IH event rates most likely appear in tpb = 5 to 10 ms, the post-bounce

time is not an experimentally observable quantity. The time scale t∗ we propose is deﬁned

as follows. First we propose to bin the neutrino events with a 5 ms bin width. Second, if

the characteristic sharp peak emerges (such as MSW-IH or VFT scenario), then t∗ = 0 is

deﬁned at 5 ms before the peak. In other words the upper limit of the ﬁrst time bin, t = 5

ms, is right at the peak. Finally, if the sharp peak does not appear, then t∗ = 0 is deﬁned at

the time when ﬁrst event appears. For the IBD events to be discussed later, we also deﬁne

the origin of t∗ in the same way since there are no clear event peaks as shown by Fig. 3.

It is important to note that the origin of t∗ depends on simulations. Taking Fig. 3 as an

example, the SN neutrino events predicted by simulations G and N occur signiﬁcantly later

than those predicted by simulations B and F.

In Fig. 4, we present K i,Ar(t∗), the cumulative time distributions of νeAr event rates, in
VFT, MSW-NH, and MSW-IH scenarios, respectively. By deﬁnition, 0 ≤ K i,Ar(t∗) ≤ 1.

In simulations G, B, and F, the neutronization peak causes K IH,Ar(t∗) and K VFT,Ar(t∗) to

increase faster in the beginning while K NH,Ar(t∗) increases in a more even pace. Quantita-

tively, the ordering K VFT,Ar(t∗) > K IH,Ar(t∗) > K NH,Ar(t∗) holds in these simulations. The

ﬁrst inequality arises because VFT scenario produces the highest νeAr event peak. Clearly

K i,Ar(t∗) is useful for discriminating diﬀerent ﬂavor transition scenarios due to the signiﬁ-

cant diﬀerences between peak event rates in diﬀerent scenarios. In simulation N, K i,Ar(t∗) is

a much less useful for doing that since none of the ﬂavor transition scenarios exhibit sharp

neutronization peaks.

FIG. 4: Cumulative time distributions K i,Ar(t∗) of νeAr signals in DUNE detector
in the time period of 0 ≤ t∗ ≤ 0.1 s. These event distributions are predictions of

simulations G, B, F, and N for progenitor masses of 8.8 M(cid:12), 10 M(cid:12), 11.2 M(cid:12), and

13 M(cid:12) from left to right, respectively.

Similar cumulative time distributions can be deﬁned for IBD events. We present

K i,IBD(t∗) in Fig. 5. For all simulations considered, it is clear that K IH,IBD(t∗) is largest

among all scenarios since IBD event rate of MSW-IH increases the fastest in the earlier

time. Explicitly, the ordering K IH,IBD(t∗) > K VFT,IBD(t∗) > K NH,IBD(t∗) holds although the

diﬀerence between K VFT,IBD and K NH,IBD is not signiﬁcant.

We shall see momentarily that VFT and MSW-NH can be distinguished by invoking only

νeAr events. On the the hand, to distinguish between VFT and MSW-IH, both νeAr and ¯νe

IBD events are required. For experimental analysis in liquid Argon detector, it is convenient

to study RAr(t∗) deﬁned by

scenario while K Ar(t∗) is the observed cumulative event fraction in the liquid Argon detector.
We note that K IH,Ar

sim (t∗) serves as a basis for comparing diﬀerent ﬂavor transition scenarios.
It is easy to see that RAr(0) = RAr(0.1s) = 1/3 by deﬁnition. The functional form of RAr(t∗)

between the two end points depend on the true neutrino ﬂavor transition scenario in SN.

Since we are yet to observe galactic SN burst, we need to rely on simulation data to obtain

the expected RAr(t∗) for diﬀerent ﬂavor transition scenarios of SN neutrinos.

16

We have proposed to use the time evolution of SN neutrino event rates during the neu-

tronization burst to test MSW eﬀects occurring in SN neutrino propagation. The non-MSW

scenario for comparison is the classical ﬂavor transition probability for neutrino propagation

in vacuum. The event rates for various ﬂavor transition scenarios are calculated with SN

neutrino emissions extracted from SN simulation data of four groups [20–23]. The behaviors

of neutrino emissions in these four simulations are analyzed.

To characterize the neutronization peak of νe ﬂux observable in MSW-IH and VFT sce-
narios, we deﬁne cumulative time distribution K i,Ar(t∗) of SN νe event in liquid Argon
detector for t between 0 and 0.1s as in Eq. (17). To further quantify the slope of K i,Ar(t∗)

for diﬀerent ﬂavor transition scenarios, we deﬁne the quantity Ri,Ar

s

(t∗) as given by Eq. (19)

with the subscript s indicating the simulation dependence of Ri,Ar(t∗). It is seen from Fig. 6

that RNH,Ar
s

is distinguishable from both RVFT,Ar

s

and RIH,Ar

s

in DUNE detector given statis-

tical uncertainties and simulation dependencies. However RVFT,Ar

s

and RIH,Ar

s

are not well

separated. To discriminate these two scenarios, we invoke IBD events caused by SN ¯νe

ﬂux and measured by liquid scintillation detector, i.e., we deﬁne the quantity Ri,IBD

in the case of liquid Argon detector. We observed that RIH,IBD

separated from VFT by combining measurements of DUNE and JUNO detectors.

In conclusion, the combined observations by liquid argon and liquid scintillation detectors

are imperative for discriminating MSW from VFT ﬂavor transitions during SN neutrino

propagation. We have seen that liquid argon detectors can separate MSW-NH from MSW-

IH and VFT while the latter two can be further discriminated with the IBD events of liquid

scintillation detectors considered.
