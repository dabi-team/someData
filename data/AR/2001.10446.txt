Abstract: Gaseous detectors are widely used in high-energy physics experiments, and in particular
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), to provide tracking and triggering over large volumes.
It has been recently estimated that Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), used for muon detection, have
the highest contribution on the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the LHC experiments.
Gas mixtures for RPCs are mainly made of C2H2F4, which is a greenhouse gas with a high
environmental impact in the atmosphere. C2H2F4 is already phasing out of production, due to
recent European Union (EU) regulations, and its cost is expected to increase in the near future.
Therefore, ﬁnding alternative gas mixtures made of gas components with a low Global Warming
Potential (GWP) has become extremely important for limiting the GHG emissions as well as for
economic reasons.

The novel hydroﬂuorooleﬁns are likely appropriate candidates to replace C2H2F4 due to their
similar chemical structures. This study is focused on the characterization of innovative gas mixtures
with tetraﬂuoropropene HFO1234ze(E) (C3H2F4) that is one of the most eco-friendly hydroﬂuo-
rooleﬁns, thanks to its very low GWP. HFO1234ze(E)-based gas mixtures with the addition of Ar,
N2, O2 and CO2 are extensively discussed in this paper as well as the role of i-C4H10 and SF6 in
such mixtures.

Gaseous detectors are widely used in high-energy physics experiments, and in particular at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), to provide tracking and triggering over large volumes. It
has been recently estimated that Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), used for muon detection, have
the highest contribution on the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the LHC experiments
[1]. RPC detectors are operated with a large fraction (between 89% and 95%) of tetraﬂuoroethane
C2H2F4, whose trade name is R-134a. In addition, diﬀerent concentrations of i-C4H10 and SF6 are
used in RPC gas mixtures with the aim to optimize the detector performance. In the case of RPCs
at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, the concentrations of i-C4H10 and SF6 are 4.5% and 0.3%,
respectively, while the ALICE gas mixture contains 10.0% i-C4H10 and 0.3% SF6.

A greenhouse gas is classiﬁed according to its Global Warming Potential (GWP). This potential
indicates the heat trapped by a gas in the atmosphere thus contributing to the greenhouse eﬀect.
The GWP of CO2 is equal to 1 by deﬁnition. On the contrary, the GWPs of C2H2F4 and SF6 are
1430 and 22800, respectively, whereas the GWP of i-C4H10 is 3 [2]. This implies that the GWP
of the ATLAS/CMS gas mixture is ~1430, while the GWP of the gas mixture used for the ALICE
muon RPCs is ~1351.

Recent regulations from the European Union (EU) impose a gradual limitation of the production
and usage of ﬂuorinated greenhouse gases (such as C2H2F4) [2]. This could lead to a progressive
price increase of these gases. Therefore, ﬁnding gas mixtures made of low GWP components
has become extremely important for limiting the GHG emissions in the atmosphere as well as
for economic reasons. The new gas mixtures for RPCs must at least provide similar detector
performance as the current ones.

In this paper we report the results of R&D studies on eco-friendly gas mixtures for RPCs, used

for the muon detection, at the LHC experiments.
The paper is organized as follows.
In section 2 we discuss the approach to ﬁnd alternative,
environment-friendly, gas mixtures. The characterization of C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with
addition of the most common atmospheric gases is presented in section 3, whereas the measurements
of detector performance with gas mixtures of C3H2F4 and CO2 are reported in section 4. Finally,
conclusions are drawn in section 5.

2 RPC operation with environment-friendly gases

RPC gas mixtures, currently used at the LHC experiments, are not environment-friendly because of
the presence of greenhouse gases. More than 95% of the total GWP of RPC gas mixtures at LHC
is due to the presence of C2H2F4.

The replacement of C2H2F4 with tetraﬂuoropropene C3H2F4 turns out to be a promising
approach to ﬁnd a more eco-friendly gas mixture [3–6].
Isomers of tetraﬂuoropropene are
HFO1234ze(Z), HFO1234ze(E) and HFO1234yf. The most interesting isomer for the purposes
of these R&D studies is the trans-1,3,3,3-tetraﬂuoroprop-1-ene HFO1234ze(E) because it has a
low boiling point (-19 ÂřC) and is not ﬂammable below 30 ÂřC. The GWP of HFO1234ze(E) is
7 according to EU regulations [2], which is ~200 times lower than that of C2H2F4. More recent
studies have revised the GWP of HFO1234ze(E) to less than 1 [7]. In addition, it has been estimated
that the decay products of HFO1234ze(E) in the atmosphere have a negligible environmental impact
[8].

R&D studies on RPCs have been performed with HFO1234ze(E)-based gas mixtures. Here-
after, HFO1234ze(E) will be simply named as C3H2F4 in order to be consistent with the chemical
notation recognized by IUPAC1 and used for all other gases in this work. Detector performance of
single-gap RPCs of the ALICE muon spectrometer [9, 10] will be used as reference in this work.

2.1 Experimental set-up

A detailed description of the experimental set-up is presented in a previous work [11], while in this
paper we only introduce its fundamental aspects.

R&D studies on various gas mixtures are carried out through one small-size (50 × 50 cm2, 2
mm gas gap) RPC with similar features as the ALICE muon RPCs [9, 10]. The ALICE muon RPCs
have electrodes in phenolic bakelite with a resistivity of 109 ÷ 1010 Ω cm [12], separated by a gas
gap of 2 mm. The standard ALICE mixture is 89.7% C2H2F4, 10.0% i-C4H10 and 0.3% SF6 [13].
The relative humidity of the gas mixture is kept constant at ~37% with the aim to prevent variations
of the electrode resistivity [14, 15].

In the experimental set-up, the detector is exposed to the cosmic-ray ﬂux and equipped with
the ampliﬁed front-end electronics FEERIC [16]. FEERIC ampliﬁes signals up to ±1 pC in the
linear range [16], which is the typical input charge expected for the RPCs in avalanche mode. The
four adjacent strips covering the trigger area are read out on both ends: on one end the signals are
discriminated by FEERIC with the aim to assess the eﬃciency, while on the other end the analogic

signals are summed by a fan-in/fan-out module and then digitized by an oscilloscope (LeCroy
WaveSurfer 510) in order to measure the signal amplitude [11].

Figure 1 shows a sketch of the experimental set-up.

mixtures.

2.2 Methodology

The new gas mixture with low GWP has to provide similar detector performance as the current one
with the standard ALICE mixture. In this work, the working point, the fraction of streamers, the
average charge of signals and the current stability are used to assess the performance of the tested
gas mixtures.

The eﬃciency of the RPC detector is evaluated by analyzing the FEERIC response in each strip
in the presence of a trigger signal [11]. The FEERIC discrimination threshold is ~130 fC (70 mV
after the FEERIC ampliﬁcation [17]). This threshold has been selected equal to the value used in
one RPC of the ALICE muon identiﬁcation system, equipped with FEERIC prototypes, with fully
satisfactory performance during the data taking a period from 2015 to 2018 [17].

Signals with an amplitude higher than 18 mV are tagged as streamers [11]. Streamers are not
desirable when RPCs are operated in avalanche mode because they reduce the rate capability of the
detector [18] and may enhance ageing eﬀects [15].

In ﬁgure 2 the eﬃciency curve2 and the streamer probability versus HV is shown for the ALICE

mixture and for pure C3H2F4.

For the tested RPC, the eﬃciency plateau is reached at ~9.8 kV when the detector is equipped
with FEERIC and ﬂushed with the ALICE mixture. The streamer probability is about 5% at ~9.8 kV.
On the contrary, the direct replacement of the ALICE mixture with 100% C3H2F4 is not advisable

2The eﬃciency curves as a function of HV are ﬁtted by the following sigmoid function:

(cid:15)(HV) =

(cid:15) max
1 + exp[−α · (HV − HV0.5)]

(2.1)

where (cid:15) max is the eﬃciency for HV −→ ∞, HV0.5 is the HV value for which the eﬃciency is equal to a half of (cid:15) max and
α is the slope at the inﬂection point [11].

because it leads to a too high operating voltage. Indeed, the RPC with 100% C3H2F4 is completely
ineﬃcient up to 14 kV, as shown in ﬁgure 2.

In this work, C3H2F4 is diluted with Ar, N2, O2 and CO2 in order to reduce the operating

voltage of the detector.

3 Characterization of C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with addition of Ar, N2 or O2

The most common atmospheric gases have been tested in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures in order to
lower the working point of RPCs. In particular, the study is here focused on Ar, N2 and O2 as their
GWP is 0.

Figure 3 shows the experimental results of the eﬃciency and streamer probability curves of
the RPC with 45% C3H2F4 and the remaining fraction of Ar, N2 or O2. As shown in ﬁgure 3a,
the RPC operating voltages with C3H2F4-based gas mixtures and addition of Ar, N2 and O2 turn
out to be extremely lower than that measured with pure C3H2F4. In particular, the eﬃciency curve
with Ar is at lower HV values by ~200 V in comparison to that with the standard ALICE mixture.
On the contrary, the RPC working point with 55% O2 and 45% C3H2F4 is ~1.0 kV higher than
that with the standard ALICE mixture, while the use of N2 in place of O2 shifts the working point
by 1.5 kV. In ﬁgure 3b, the streamer probability curves are shown as a function of HV−HV(cid:15) =0.9.
HV(cid:15) =0.9 is the voltage where the eﬃciency is 90% of its maximum value ((cid:15)max), and is obtained,
for each mixture, by ﬁtting the eﬃciency curve with a sigmoid function. No signiﬁcant changes
in the streamer suppression are observed if 55% Ar, N2 or O2 is added to C3H2F4. In fact, the
streamer probability is always greater than ~80% at HV−HV(cid:15) =0.9 of ~200 V, while it is only ~5%
in the standard ALICE mixture.

The average charge of RPC signals, induced in the read-out strips, has been measured at the
working point in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with 55% Ar, N2 or O2. In order to measure this
quantity for each gas mixture under test, RPC signals are acquired by the oscilloscope and then
integrated in a time window of 100 ns by including each signal totally. At the working point, the
average charge is ~2.6 pC with the standard ALICE mixture, while it turns out to be more than one
order of magnitude higher in all other gas mixtures. In particular, the average charge is ~66 pC and

fraction of Ar, N2 or O2. In addition, the eﬃciency and the streamer probability of the RPC with the standard

~68 pC in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with 55% Ar and 55% N2, respectively. On the contrary, a
lower average charge of ~36 pC is measured with 55% O2. However, a current instability has been
observed if the RPC operates with 45% C3H2F4 and 55% O2. In fact, the current at the working
point increases by ~60% in 5 hours. The instability of the detector current has been observed in all
C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with O2 in diﬀerent concentrations, tested so far.

4 Characterization of C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with CO2

Since Ar, N2 and O2 do not turn out to be suitable in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures for RPCs, the use
of CO2 is here evaluated.

Figure 4a shows the eﬃciency curves of RPC at diﬀerent ratios between C3H2F4 and CO2.
If the gas mixture with 45% C3H2F4 and 55% CO2 is taken into consideration, the working
point of the detectors is ~1.0 kV higher than that with the standard ALICE mixture. A similar eﬀect
has been already obtained in the gas mixture of 45% C3H2F4 and 55% O2, as shown in ﬁgure 3.
The streamer probability in the gas mixture with 55% CO2 is ~50% at 90% eﬃciency, as shown in
ﬁgure 4b. This value is lower than the streamer probability obtained in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures
with the addition of 55% Ar, N2 or O2, while it is still far from the value in the standard ALICE

– 5 –

mixture. Indeed, the streamer probability with 45% C3H2F4 and the remaining fraction of Ar, N2
or O2 is ~80% at 90% eﬃciency, while it is less than 5% in the standard ALICE mixture. In the
mixture with 55% CO2, the average signal charge is ~27 pC at the working point (11.2 kV), which
is one order of magnitude greater than that of the standard ALICE mixture.

If the fraction of CO2 is increased and that of C3H2F4 is decreased, the working point turns
out to be shifted towards lower voltages. Increasing the CO2 fraction from 45% to 55% reduces the
working point by ~1 kV. Figure 4b shows the streamer probability as a function of HV−HV(cid:15) =0.9.
The increase of C3H2F4 fraction against CO2 reduces streamers. In fact, going from 45% to 55%
C3H2F4, the streamer probability at 90% eﬃciency decreases from ~40% to ~20%.

Figure 4. Eﬃciency (a) and streamer probability (b) of the RPC with C3H2F4-based gas mixtures and 45%,
50% or 55% CO2. Some statistical error bars are hidden by markers.

Taking into account the RPC working point, the streamer probability and the average charge of
signals, CO2 turns out to be the most promising solution in comparison to Ar, N2 and O2. However,
the streamer probability is quite high in gas mixtures with only C3H2F4 and CO2, so results with the
addition of i-C4H10, which has a high photo-absorption cross section, and addition of SF6, which
is a strong electronegative gas, are presented in the following.

4.1 C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with addition of CO2 and i-C4H10

The use of i-C4H10 in the C2H2F4-based gas mixtures for RPCs helps to reduce the photon-feedback
eﬀects, thanks to its high photo-absorption cross section [18].

Figures 5a and 5b show the eﬃciency and streamer probability curves, respectively, at diﬀerent
ratios between i-C4H10 and CO2, while the concentration of C3H2F4 is kept constant at 45%. The
working point increases by ~600 V when going from 10% to 20% i-C4H10, while no clear trend
emerges when the i-C4H10 fraction is varied between 0% and 10%. The streamer suppression is
more eﬃcient with i-C4H10 concentrations higher than 10%. Indeed, streamer probability at 90%
eﬃciency is ~40% without i-C4H10 or with 5% i-C4H10, while it is lower than 20% with more than
10% i-C4H10.

Figure 5. Eﬃciency (a) and streamer probability (b) of the RPC with 45% C3H2F4 and diﬀerent ratios
between CO2 and i-C4H10. Some statistical error bars are hidden by markers.

4.2 C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with addition of CO2 and SF6

The eﬀect of 1% SF6 has been tested in a gas mixture with only C3H2F4 and CO2. Thanks to its
high attachment cross sections [19], the addition of SF6 in C2H2F4-based gas mixtures allows the
suppression of streamers [20].

Figure 6 shows how the eﬃciency curve and the streamer probability change if 1% SF6 is added
to a gas mixture made of half C3H2F4 and half CO2. The shift of the working point is ~1 kV towards
higher voltages with the addition of 1% SF6. As expected, the streamers are greatly suppressed

– 7 –

with SF6. Indeed, the streamer probability at 90% eﬃciency is ~40% without SF6, whereas it is
reduced down to ~5% with 1% SF6.

Figure 6. Eﬃciency (a) and streamer probability (b) of the RPC in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures and CO2
with and without the addition of 1% SF6. Some statistical error bars are hidden by markers.

The addition of 1% SF6 reduces also the average charge of signals. At the working point, the
average charge is ~33 pC in the gas mixture of 50% C3H2F4 and 50% CO2, while it becomes only
~4 pC in the gas mixture with 1% SF6.

5 Conclusions

The basic performance of C3H2F4-based gas mixtures for RPCs have been studied. The usage of
100% C3H2F4 in RPCs is not advisable because it leads to a too high operating voltage, as discussed
in section 2.2.

The addition of Ar, N2, O2 and CO2 in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures reduces the operating
voltage of the detector. However, the use of Ar, N2 and O2 in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures implies
high streamer probability and signal charge at the operating voltage. In addition, current instability
is observed with the use of O2 in the gas mixture.

CO2 turns out to be the most promising solution. Indeed, values of streamer probability and
signal charge are lower than those obtained in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with addition of Ar, N2
and O2, as shown in section 3. No current instability has been observed in any of the C3H2F4-based

– 8 –

gas mixtures with CO2, tested so far. Measurements with gas mixtures made of C3H2F4 and CO2
show that the addition of both i-C4H10, as quencher, and SF6, as strong electronegative gas, improves
the RPC performance.

The interplay of C3H2F4, CO2, i-C4H10 and SF6 has been already investigated for single-gap
RPCs in avalanche mode [11]. The most promising gas mixtures, which have been found so far
[11], consist of 50% CO2, 39.7% C3H2F4, 10% i-C4H10, 0.3% SF6 and 50% CO2, 39% C3H2F4,
10% i-C4H10, 1% SF6. Their GWPs are respectively 72 and 232, while the GWP of gas mixtures
for RPCs in muon detection systems of the LHC experiments is ~1400.

Measurements of the RPC performance under irradiation are ongoing at the CERN Gamma
Irradiation Facility [21] in order to assess the rate capability and ageing properties resulting from
the C3H2F4-based gas mixtures.
