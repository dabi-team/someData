Abstract. The ArDM experiment completed a single-phase commissioning run (ArDM Run I)
in 2015 with an active liquid argon target of nearly one tonne in mass. The analysis of the
data and comparison to simulations allowed for a test of the crucial detector properties and
conﬁrmed the low background performance of the setup. The statistical rejection power for
electron recoil events using the pulse shape discrimination method was estimated using data
from a 252Cf neutron calibration source. Electron and nuclear recoil band proﬁles were found
to be well described by Gaussian distributions. Employing such a model we derive values
for the electron recoil statistical rejection power of more than 108 in the tonne-scale liquid
argon target for events with more than 50 detected photons at a 50% acceptance for nuclear
recoils. The 222Rn emanation rate of the ArDM cryostat at room temperature was found to
be 65.6±0.4 µ Hz/l, and the 39Ar speciﬁc activity from the employed atmospheric argon to be
0.95±0.05 Bq/kg. The cosmic muon ﬂux at the Canfranc underground site was determined
to be between 2 and 3.5×10−3 m2s−1. These results pave the way for the next physics run
of ArDM in the double-phase operational mode.

ArDM is a direct dark matter detection experiment for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs) searches [1]. The detector system consists of a cylindrical Time Projection Chamber
(TPC) containing a liquid argon (LAr) target mass of around 850 kg. The ArDM experiment
is able to detect signals produced by elastic scattering, from WIMPs or neutrons producing
nuclear recoils (NR) and from background particles like β or γ producing electron recoils
(ER), on argon atoms in the active volume.

In 2015, a series of commissioning runs with gaseous or liquid argon targets have been
performed in single-phase mode to explore the functionality and performance of the detector.
The detector was ﬁrst commissioned at room temperature with a gaseous argon (GAr) target
to verify the basic functionality of the detector components. Then the detector was cooled
down and operated with a cold GAr target to test the cryogenic system and the light detection
system at low temperature. Afterwards, data taking with a full LAr target was performed.
At last, the detector was pumped and reﬁlled with GAr to investigate the detector stability.
A detailed description of the detector and the commissioning runs can be found in Ref. [2].
The various background sources of the detector have been studied using data collected
during ArDM Run I and compared with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations. At low energy (below
1 MeV), the background originates from 39Ar-β decays, radioactive contaminants in the
materials of the detector components, and from external γ sources. At medium energy
(1-5 MeV), the background originates from Rn and its progeny, emanated from the small
contamination of 238U and 232Th in the detector materials. In addition, at high energy (>
5 MeV) the ArDM detector also recorded cosmic muon events.

The time structure of LAr scintillation is strongly correlated with the nature of the
interaction, which provides a way, the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, to reject

– 1 –

the ER, or so-called e-like, background events [3–6]. Analyzing data taken with a 252Cf
calibration source, the band proﬁles of ER or NR events were found to be well described by
Gaussian distributions. Using the separation between the ER and NR bands, the capability
of the PSD method to reject ER events was demonstrated.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, the low energy ER background is dis-
cussed using the comparison between the data taken with LAr target and the MC simulations
of diﬀerent radioactive isotopes, including results on the measurement of the 39Ar activity.
In Section 4, results are presented on the measurement of the 222Rn emanation using data
taken with GAr target at room temperature. Section 5 discusses cosmic muon rates observed
in ArDM Run I LAr data. The PSD method and the statistical rejection power results are
presented in Section 6. Finally, the work is concluded in Section 8.

2 The ArDM experiment

The Argon Dark Matter (ArDM) experiment (LSC-EXP-08, CERN-RE18) is a particle
physics experiment at the Spanish underground site LSC (Laboratorio Subterr´aneo de Can-
franc) to perform direct searches for WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. The ArDM detector is
designed as a tonne-scale dual-phase liquid-argon time projection chamber (LAr TPC) to
detect elastic scattering of WIMPs on argon nuclei, by observing ionisation and scintillation
events, which are produced by the recoiling nucleus in the argon medium [1]. During the
ﬁrst years of the project, the experiment was ﬁrst developed and constructed at CERN [7, 8]
and then installed at LSC in 2014 [9]. In 2015 ArDM completed a ﬁrst data taking period of
more than six months in the single-phase operational mode with a full LAr target of 850 kg
(ArDM Run I) [2]. In 2016 the experiment was upgraded for the a dual-phase operation.

The ArDM LAr TPC consists of 24 low-radioactivity cryogenic 8” PMTs distributed in
two equal arrays for light readout, the top PMT array above the LAr target in the gaseous
phase and the bottom array immersed in LAr. Nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs or neutrons,
or electron recoils by γ radiation, as well as charged particle (α, β or muons) interactions in
the argon medium generate scintillation light (S1) and electron-ion pairs. When the detector
works in the dual-phase (liquid and gaseous) mode, the electrons can be separated from
their ions in an electric ﬁeld and drift upwards to the argon surface. After being extracted
from the LAr to the gaseous argon (GAr) on top, these electrons are accelerated and the
secondary scintillation light (S2), which is proportional to the amount of electrons extracted,
is produced. Both S1 and S2, which are vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light with a wavelength
around 127 nm, can be wavelength shifted to visible range by a layer of tetraphenylbutadiene
(TPB) deposited on the inner surfaces and read out by the PMT arrays. In the single-phase
commissioning Run I, with zero electric ﬁeld, only S1 signals were recorded. A full detail
about the experimental setup of ArDM during Run I is reported in Ref. [2].

Table 1 summarises the Run-I data recorded at diﬀerent stages of the operation. The
detector was commissioned ﬁrst with a gaseous argon (GAr) target at room temperature,
hereafter called warm gas. Then it was cooled down and was operated with a GAr target
at LAr temperature, 87 K (cold gas). These were succeeded by the ﬁlling of the ArDM
cryostat with a total of ∼2 tonnes of LAr. The detector was then operated over six months
in the full target mode. The full-target data consists of two parts. Initially the top part
of the polyethylene (PE) neutron shield, entirely surrounding the detector vessel, was left
open (open-shield conﬁguration) to allow accesses to various service ports located on the top
cover of the vessel. When the stable performance of the detector had been veriﬁed the shield

– 2 –

was closed completely (closed-shield conﬁguration), resulting in a reduction of γ backgrounds
originating from the lab environment, which represented the designed conﬁguration of the
experiment. After 3.3 billion triggers had been recorded with the full target, the liquid was
evaporated slowly and the cryostat was warmed up. The data taking was continued over the
entire period, including transition stages, such as cool-down, ﬁlling or warm-up, that allowed
to monitor the functionality of the detector, as well as the purity of the LAr target, at diﬀerent
run stages. A total of about 4.7 billion triggered events have been recorded over the period
of Run I. About 10% of this total data was collected during calibration runs with radioactive
test sources. The calibration data collected with the full LAr target is summarized in Table
2. Metastable 83mKr atoms, which were injected into the gaseous phase and then diluted in
the LAr target, served as a main source of the light yield calibration, along with an external
57Co source. 252Cf neutron source was deployed to study the PSD capability of the ArDM
detector, as reported below in Section 6.

3 Analysis of the ER background in ArDM

For direct WIMP dark matter detection the understanding of the β or γ induced ER back-
ground events is crucial. We have produced MC simulations of γ background events from
both internal and external sources, as well as for β background events from 39Ar decay, and
compared simulation results with data, leading to an agreement at a ∼ 7% level.

3.1 Data selection

The ArDM light detection system uses 12-12 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) arranged at the
top and the bottom of a cryogenic vessel, respectively. The energy of the registered events is
characterised by the total light in units of photo-electrons (pe). The total light of an event

– 3 –

is calculated by ﬁnding and summing clusters of photon signals over the data acquisition
time window of 4 µs. The light signals, Ltop and Lbtm, are calculated from the sum of all
signal clusters found in the top and the bottom PMTs, respectively. The total detected light
Ltot is calculated from the sum of the signal from both PMT arrays. The light yield per
keV electron-equivalent energy deposit (also denoted as keVee) in the ArDM detector was
calibrated using 83mKr and 57Co sources during ArDM Run I. The obtained light yield was
1.1 pe/ keV in LAr.

A pulse shape discriminator value, f 90, deﬁned as the ratio of the light detected in the
ﬁrst 90 ns of the event to the total detected light, is used during the analysis. This value is
used to separate between ER and NR events. In addition, events with extreme f 90 values
(f 90 > 0.99 or f 90 < 0.01) are rejected due to their origin being noise. ER events can be
separated by selecting events requiring f 90 < 0.6.

The ratio of the light detected by the top PMT array to the total detected light, called
top-to-total ratio, T T R = Ltop/Ltot, is used as a discriminator to select events along the
vertical position (Z-axis in the ArDM coordinate system) in the LAr volume. For multiple-
scatter events, produced by e.g. a γ photon that undergoes several Compton scatterings,
this value shows the mean vertical position of the interaction vertices weighted by the energy
deposit at each vertex. Larger T T R values correspond to vertices closer to the top of the
detector. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of T T R values in the data.

Figure 1. T T R distribution during data taken with open (blue), closed (red) top shield conﬁgura-
tions. The diﬀerence of the two distributions is shown in black. T T R values larger than 0.5 correspond
to vertical positions closer to the top of the detector.

3.2 Simulation

A Geant4-based detector simulation software with light ray-tracing has been developed for
ArDM. The ArDM TPC, the stainless-steel detector vessel and the surrounding PE neutron
shield are modeled with approximate geometries and material compositions. The response

existing Geant4 scintillation and wavelength-shifting processes were tuned to describe diﬀer-
ent time structures of the VUV light emission for electron and nuclear recoil events in liquid
and gaseous argon, and in the TPB layer properties on the various surfaces, respectively.
Light propagation (attenuation and Rayleigh scattering) in the LAr medium and boundary
processes (reﬂection and refraction) across diﬀerent materials are implemented as a function
of the wavelength. The PMT response to the detected photoelectrons, e.g. pulse shape and
amplitude ﬂuctuations, are simulated. The simulated events include digitised waveforms of
the 24 PMT channels, recorded in the same format as in the ArDM front-end electronics, al-
lowing to reconstruct the events using the same analysis software as used for the experimental
data. Parameters describing the optical processes were tuned to the data obtained from Run
I. Measured light spectra for ER events originating from 39Ar β-decays and the de-excitation
of 83mKr calibration source, as a function of the vertical position of the interaction vertex re-
constructed by the T T R variable, were used for this purpose for their well-understood origins
and spatially uniform distributions in the LAr bulk. A set of parameters best describing the
observed data was evaluated using a Bayesian likelihood technique. A detailed description
of the ArDM detector simulation software, as well as the tuning procedures, is given in Ref.
[10].

To fully understand the ER background events observed during Run I γ backgrounds
originating from the material contamination in the detector components (internal source)
and in the experimental hall (external source) were simulated, as well as the 39Ar β-decays.
39Ar β electrons were generated according to the theoretical spectrum described by the phase
space factors, the Fermi correction, as well as the ﬁrst forbidden Gamow-Teller transitions
(see [10] and its references).

For the γ background simulations radioactive decays (α, β, electron capture etc.) of
relevant sources, i.e. unstable isotopes in the 238U and 232Th decay series, 40K and 60Co,
are simulated using the corresponding module of Geant4 [11]. After a primary decay of
the mother nucleus invoked in the simulation γ photons are emitted in the radiative de-
excitation process of the excited daughter nucleus, according to the decay branching ratios.
For the 238U and 232Th series a secular equilibrium is assumed. For the internal sources the
primary particles (mother nuclei) are distributed homogeneously inside the material of each
detector component. For the external sources an envelope surrounding the PE neutron shield
is deﬁned and the sources are distributed uniformly over its surface. The simulation data
was generated separately for all detector components and radioactive sources, allowing later
to scale each contribution according to the measured activities.

Due to short mean free paths compared to the size of ArDM (6–20 cm for the γ energies
200–2600 keV) most of the interaction vertices from γ background events are found near the
edge of the LAr target (self-shielding eﬀect). More than 80% of the γ events contain two
or more interaction vertices (Compton scatterings and photoelectric eﬀect). As an example
the mean interaction multiplicity of external γ background events in the LAr target, as a
function of the γ energy at the incidence into the LAr volume, is shown in Fig. 2 (left).
The mean value of the multiplicity increases from ∼2 at a γ energy of 100 keV to ∼4.5 at
500 keV, saturating at a value of ∼5 above 1 MeV. In contrast, more than 99% of the 39Ar
events are single-scatter events, while the remaining events are multiple-scatter events from
Bremsstrahlung.

The multiple-scatter γ events are conﬁned to a small volume. The standard deviation
of the true vertical positions of the interaction vertices, σZ, in the middle of the detector,

0.5 < T T R < 0.6, is shown as a function of the total detected light in Fig. 2 (right), for
39Ar-β and 232Th-series γ events from the polyethylene pillars of the drift cage. The mean
position deviation was found to be 3–4 cm on average, and approximately constant above
500 keV. This leads to a similar reconstructed vertical position resolution (T T R) for 39Ar β
and γ events, despite the diﬀerence in scattering multiplicity of these processes. The energy
dependence can approximately be explained by the statistical ﬂuctuation of the binomial

2 + B, with T T R = 0.55 and the ﬁt
distribution, σZ(Ltot) = A · {Ltot · T T R · (1 − T T R)}
parameters (A, B) = (244, 0.13), the solid line plotted in the same ﬁgure. Averaging over the
full energy range, weighted by the β or γ emission spectra, the resolution was found to be
∼9 cm, which reduces to ∼6 cm above 100 pe, for both, 39Ar and γ backgrounds.

3.3 Electron recoil background sources

The observed ER events originate from 39Ar-β decays, radioactive contaminants in the ma-
terials surrounding the LAr volume (internal sources) and in the experimental hall (external
sources) including 238U , 232Th , 40K and 60Co series.

The radioactivity of the detector components was determined in a material screening
campaign, using the high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector facility at LSC. Characteristic
γ lines from diﬀerent nucleus were identiﬁed and the corresponding activities were estimated.
Main contributions to the γ activities were found to originate in the 238U and 232Th series,
and additionally in 40K or 60Co. The detailed results were shown in Ref. [2].

The detector vessel is surrounded by an equilateral octagon cylindrical polyethylene
shield, where the top cap is a pre-assembled unit which can easily be opened and closed by
crane. The external γ ﬂux are determined from ArDM Run I data based on the diﬀerence in
the measured ER events between the so-called open and closed top shield detector conﬁg-
uration. In order to model the diﬀerence in the light spectra between the open and closed
shield conﬁgurations, it is assumed that the contribution to the diﬀerence is dominated by
external γ sources. The distribution of events as a function of T T R vertical position value is
shown in Figure 1 for the open and closed shield conﬁgurations, and with the diﬀerence of the

conﬁgurations was found to be well described in the Monte Carlo model by a combination
of the γ spectra obtained from simulation of the 238U, 232Th, and 40K radioactive series
distributed homogeneously on an envelope around the ArDM detector, as shown in Figure 3.
The number of events in the Monte Carlo spectrum for the source i (i = 238U, 232Th, 40K)
is given as NMCi = fi · Nγi · (cid:15)i, where fi is the scaling factor obtained from a ﬁt to the light
spectrum diﬀerence in the data, Nγi the number of generated γ photons in the simulation
and (cid:15)i the event acceptance, which can be determined by the simulation. The equivalent
external γ ﬂux jγi originating from the source i can then be obtained as

jγi =

fi · Nγi
2 · tD · A

[cm−2s−1],

where tD [s] is the live time for the data taking and A [cm2] the total area of the surface of
the envelope. In this model spatially uniform and isotropic ﬂuxes are assumed, as well as
a secular equilibrium for the 238U and 232Th decay series. The estimated external γ ﬂux
result is 0.72, 0.13 and 0.05 cm−2 s−1 for 238U, 232Th decay chains, and 40K respectively.

The samples from the Monte Carlo simulations have been ﬁtted to the data with a
Bayesian model evaluation, using the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT) [12]. The MC tem-
plate based binned likelihood model is a linear sum of the simulation samples obtained for
the various radioactive isotopes in the light signal bins. The model assumes Gaussian un-
certainties in each total detected light bin. Given the data, BAT ﬁnds the best parameters
in the template likelihood model by numerically evaluating the Bayes theorem, varying the
parameters of the template model, and calculating various credibility intervals from the full
posterior distribution. The model parameters are the individual relative contributions of
each Monte Carlo sample and the light yield scale. This latter parameter was introduced to
allow for uncertainties in the light yield calibration in the data. Typically, less then ∼5%
variation was suﬃcient to describe any possible light scale uncertainty.

Figure 4 shows the spectrum of the total detected light for ER events in data (black dots)
compared to Monte Carlo simulations (ﬁlled coloured histograms). For this comparison a data
sample of ∼ 150 million events was selected requiring 0.4 < T T R < 0.6 and 0.0 < f 90 < 0.6.
For the weighting of the internal detector components we use the activities obtained from the
material screening results. For the external sources the results obtained from γ ﬂux evaluation
are used, in particular the ratios of the ﬂuxes of the external sources are constrained to be
the same within a factor of two in both model evaluations. The 39Ar contribution is a free
parameter during the ﬁt. The level of agreement, shown in Figure 4, between MC simulation
and data demonstrates the good understanding of the observed data and the diﬀerent sources
of events.

The dominant background component is 39Ar-β decays and shows a good agreement
with the expected value of ∼1 Bq/kg, amounting to ∼74% of the selected events. The remain-
ing contributions are compatible with events originating from internal and external sources,
amounting to ∼22% and ∼4% of the events, respectively. The composition of the various
background sources is shown in Table 3 as rates. The uncertainties around the rates have
been estimated by allowing a variation in the background contributions by 50% and repeat-
ing the Bayesian evaluation. The 238U contribution was found to have the largest relative
uncertainty, however, overall it only presents a ∼25% error in the total external gamma rate.
The estimated uncertainty on the total rate from Monte Carlo simulation is at a level of
∼7%.

3.4 Measurement of the 39Ar speciﬁc activity

The 39Ar speciﬁc activity can be determined from the model evaluation results presented
in the previous section, using the formula N 39Ar = tD · (cid:15) · m · A. Here N 39Ar is the number
of detected 39Ar events, tD is the live time of the data taking, (cid:15) is the event acceptance
determined from the Monte Carlo simulation, m is the LAr mass and A is the 39Ar speciﬁc
activity. The obtained 39Ar speciﬁc activity in ArDM detector is A = 0.95 ± 0.05 Bq/kg.
The measurement uncertainties come from the ﬁducial volume estimation and the extracted
fraction of 39Ar events from the analysis.

4 Measurement of 222Rn emanation

The internal 222Rn and its progeny dominate the detected events at medium energy in
ArDM Run I data. The emanation of 222Rn originates from the decay chain of the long-
lived unstable isotope 238U being present in the detector components. As a noble gas with
a 3.82 day half-life, 222Rn atoms can migrate from the source of their production into the
active detector volume. Recoils produced by α particles from 222Rn and its progeny could
mimic a signal expected from WIMP interactions and could be detected. To understand the
radon background, we measured the emanation of 222Rn from detector components using
data taken with GAr target at room temperature.

The signals from internal 222Rn and its progeny are monitored by counting the decays
of the isotopes 222Rn, 218Po, and 214Po in the energy region between 5 and 7 MeV, and the

In order to identify the 5.49 MeV α events originating from the bulk of the gas, a ﬁxed energy
window is used together with a T T R discrimination, 0.32 < T T R < 0.64, corresponding to
217.0±5.7 liters of ﬁducial volume. To avoid the collisional quenching eﬀect of argon triplet
excimers due to the impurities present in GAr, we use detected light in the fast component
between 500 and 800 pe to select 222Rn events.

Figure 5 shows the 222Rn event rate variation after the detector tank was pumped and
reﬁlled with pure GAr. The red curve is an exponential ﬁt to the data. During the ﬁt the
half-life was ﬁxed to be 3.82 days according to the literature value. The 222Rn emanation
rate increased exponentially, but not from zero. This indicates that the 222Rn atoms emanate
from both the detector materials and the gas bottle. We set an upper limit for the emanation
rate of 222Rn atom as 65.6±0.4 µ Hz/l for the ArDM detector.

target. The red curve is an exponential ﬁt to the data, R(t) = A − B × e−t/τ , where the parameter
τ is ﬁxed to τ1/2 = 3.82 days.

5 Large signal assessment of the ER spectrum

For the analysis of the large signal ER spectrum a data set of 1.7×109 events was used from
the closed shield conﬁguration. The events are selected requiring f 90 to be around the centre

logarithmic histogram, in Figure 6, spanning over 8 orders of magnitudes in the count rate.
At low energies the spectrum is dominated by 39Ar β events (< 103 pe), while the middle
energy part is dominated by the general radiogenic γ background, described in detail in the
previous sections. We interpret events above the relatively sharp cut-oﬀ around 4×103 pe
as having been induced by cosmic muons. The tail and peak features in this part of the
spectrum are interpreted as showers in the rock, or muons crossing the active LAr target
partially or fully. Some deformation of the spectral response has to be taken into account

From the life-time of the detector during the recording of this data (1.18×106 s, 13.6 days)
and the amount of events under the main peak (7445) we ﬁnd a cosmic muon rate in Hall A
of LSC of 2.1×10−3 m−2 s−1, by assuming an eﬀective area of 3 m2 of the ArDM LAr target.
If we include the events from the tail (in total 12318) we ﬁnd a rate of 3.5×10−3 m−2 s−1.
These values compare very well to the results from Ref. [13] of 2–4×10−3 m−2 s−1.

6 Electron recoil statistical rejection power in Run I

One of the most important property of LAr as a target is the capability to reject electron recoil
background processes at a very high level. This is possible due to the discrimination power
of the pulse-shape from the LAr scintillation light. The classiﬁcation of events into ER and
NR-type allows to quantify the rejection capability of ArDM. The statistical rejection power
for ER events is evaluated by calculating the leakage of events from ER (0.2 < f 90 < 0.6)
into the NR region (0.7 < f 90 < 1.0). The ER contamination (ERC) is deﬁned as the
probability of incorrectly classifying an ER event as a NR event given a particular level of
NR acceptance. The PSD rejection power (REJ ) is then calculated from the tail integral of
the ER Gaussian function around the NR region, as follows,

ERC(N ) =

sigma units distance from the mean, Mnr, of the Gaussian approximated NR event distribu-
tion, Mer and σer are the mean and sigma of the Gaussian functions, Ger(Mer, σer), ﬁtted to
the data in the ER region.

In this analysis a dataset of 23.8×106 events is used. The data has been collected
during ArDM Run I with 252Cf calibration source placed around the detector. During the
analysis f 90 distributions are taken in various total light bins between 15 and 205 pe. The
distribution of events in the data is illustrated in Figure 7, which shows the number of events
detected as a function of f 90. The Gaussian functions in the ER region are ﬁtted in the range
0.2 < f 90 < 0.6 to the data. In order to increase the signal-over-background ratio in the NR
region we ﬁrst subtract the background (dominated by ER events from 39Ar-β decays and
the external γ photons) from the f 90 distributions and ﬁt the Gaussian functions to each
residual histogram in the range 0.7 < f 90 < 1.0. The result of the ﬁtting procedure is also
illustrated in Figure 7. We parameterise the obtained f 90 Gaussian mean values (Mer, Mnr),

σ-values (σer,σnr) are parameterised with a function of the form σ(Ltot) = A + B/(Ltot − C).
The ﬁt results together with the parameterised mean and sigma values are shown in Figure 8.
The ER statistical rejection power is calculated from the parameterised values using
Eq 6.1. The results are shown in Figure 9 as a function of the light signal for 50%, 84.0%,
97.6%, and 99.7% NR acceptance levels, corresponding to [0, 3σnr], [-σnr, 3σnr], [-2σnr, 3σnr],
and [-3σnr, 3σnr] limits across the calculated NR mean value Mnr. As an example, for a
50% NR acceptance level, the PSD rejection power is larger than 108 for events with total
detected light larger than 50 pe, corresponding to about 50 keVee using the ArDM Run I light
yield.

7 Sensitivity to detect 39Ar decays in depleted argon

Despite electronic recoil background can be suppressed by several orders of magnitudes by
PSD, next generation LAr DM detectors with target sizes of several tens of tonnes, require
argon depleted from radioactive impurities (DAr), above all from the 39Ar isotope, which is
present in an abundance of about 1 Bq per litre LAr, if produced from atmospheric argon
(AAr). This is necessary to reduce the event rate in the target, as well as to suppress
feedthrough into the signal region from background related to 39Ar beta decays. One of the
cornerstones of the DS20k project is the provision of several tens of tons of depleted argon,
collected from well gases. Further on a reﬁnement of the argon in distillation columns is
planned [14]. Presently about 150 kg of DAr was produced and was recently qualiﬁed in the
DS-50 detector. A depletion factor of 1/1400 was found with respect to atmospheric argon.
It is not known and not proven that the depletion factor will be the same for all samples
of gas extracted from underground wells, as local rock conditions can signiﬁcantly alter the
composition. Therefore, all future batches of DAr will have to be tested individually. Thanks
to the large target mass and the low background installation, the ArDM facility at LSC is
ideally suited to determine the depletion factor for low 39Ar argon of future batches to be
produced in view of DS-20k.

The ArDM sensitivity to the 39Ar β-decay activity in the LAr target was studied with
respect to external and internal γ backgrounds, based on the MC simulations as described
in Section 3.4. For a ﬁrst estimate the simulated interaction vertices of γ photons in the
LAr target are plotted in Fig. 10 (left) as a function of the vertical (Z) and the radial (R)
coordinate. Contributions from all the simulated internal and external sources were scaled
according to the measurements and then summed up. Thanks to the self-shielding of the large

visible. Furthermore, more than 80% of these γ photons undergo multiple Compton scatters
in the drift volume of ArDM. With an event vertex reconstruction based on S2 signals in
the dual-phase mode, this allows an eﬃcient reduction of the backgrounds inside a ﬁducial
volume, using the outer volume as a veto.

Four diﬀerent ﬁducial volumes, depicted also in Fig. 10 (left), were investigated. An S2
threshold of 2 keV for the energy deposit at each vertex was applied. The resulting rates of
the γ background for the four ﬁducialisations are summarised in Table 4 with the rejection
rate. The rates were calculated by the integral of the reconstructed light spectra in the range
of the 39Ar β-spectrum, 50–600 pe.

Figure 10 (right) shows the sensitivity of ArDM towards the 39Ar content in the target.
The numbers are calculated for a 3σ measurement of the event rate in the 39Ar β-spectrum
over statistical background ﬂuctuations. These estimates indicate, that a measurement time
of a few weeks in ArDM is needed to determine depletion factors up to 105 in respect to
atmospheric argon, which is within the requirements for DS-20k.

Until large amounts of depleted argon will be available, the DS-20k Collaboration en-
visages a ﬁrst step to build and insert a smaller chamber (about 0.5(cid:96)) into the center of the
ArDM target, which can be ﬁlled with a separate line from the outside with already exist-
ing depleted argon from the DS collaboration. This chamber will contain a SiPM detector
module in the top and in the bottom, and will also serve to get experienced with this new
photo detection system. As DAr becomes available and more SiPM detectors are produced,
a larger scale setup will be installed in ArDM at LSC to fully characterise the DAr batches
needed for DS-20k.

8 Conclusion

In this paper measurement results have been presented on backgrounds and pulse shape
discrimination of the ArDM experiment using Run I data. From the Monte Carlo model
ﬁtted to the data the ER background at low energy is found to be dominated by events
originating from 39Ar-β decays, which contribute to the selected events at level of ∼ 74%. In
the 1−4 MeV energy range the external γ background dominates with an overall contribution
of ∼ 22% and the internal detector components contribute at a level of ∼ 4% . The speciﬁc
activity of 39Ar has been estimated to be ∼ 1Bq/kg. The external γ background ﬂux
has been measured, using the light spectrum diﬀerence between open and closed top shield
conﬁgurations, and the total ﬂux is estimated to be 0.9 cm−2 s−1. From these measurements,
we conﬁrm the low background condition of ArDM detector.

At medium and high energies, signals produced by 222Rn and cosmic muons contribute
to the data. From the data taken with GAr target at room temperature we estimate the
222Rn emanation rate of ArDM detector to be 65.6±0.4 µ Hz/l, which shows that the radon
level was low during ArDM Run I. From the ER light spectrum at high energy, the cosmic
muon ﬂux is estimated to be between 2.1 and 3.5 ×10−3 m−2 s−1, which agrees well with
independent measurements.

Using the pulse shape discrimination method the ER statistical rejection power is found
to be more than 108 at 50% NR acceptance and more than 50 pe detected. Together with
recent results reported by DEAP-3600 [15], this study shows the excellent performance ob-
tainable with liquid Argon targets at the tonne scale.
