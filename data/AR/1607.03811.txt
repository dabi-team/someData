ABSTRACT
In the context of Sun-Earth connection of coronal mass ejections and magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs), we studied
the solar active region (AR) and the magnetic properties of magnetic cloud (MC) event during April 14-15,
2013. We use in-situ observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer and source AR measurements
from the Solar Dynamic Observatory. The MCs magnetic structure is reconstructed from the Grad-Shafranov
method which reveals a northern component of the axial ﬁeld with left-handed helicity. The MC invariant axis
is highly inclined to the ecliptic plane pointing northward and is rotated by 117o with respect to the source
region PIL. The net axial ﬂux and current in the MC are comparatively higher than from the source region.
Linear force-free alpha distribution (10−7 − 10−6 m−1) at the sigmoid leg matches the range of twist number in
the MC of 1-2 AU MFR. The MFR is non-linear force-free with decreasing twist from the axis (9 turns/AU)
towards the edge. Therefore Gold-Hoyle (GH) conﬁguration, assuming a constant twist, is more consistent
with the MC structure than the Lundquist conﬁguration of increasing twist from the axis to boundary. As
an indication to that, the GH conﬁguration yields better ﬁtting to the global trend of in-situ magnetic ﬁeld
components, in terms of rms, than the Lundquist model. These cylindrical conﬁgurations improved the MC
ﬁtting results when considered the effect of self-similar expansion of MFR. For such twisting behaviour, this
study suggests an alternative ﬁtting procedure to better characterise the MC magnetic structure and its source
region links.

1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic clouds (MCs) are large scale, organized mag-
netic structures in interplanetary space (Burlaga et al. 1981),
characterized by a smoothly rotating ﬁeld of enhanced ﬁeld
strength, low proton temperature, and low proton beta. They
are usually observed in situ as interplanetary coronal mass
ejection (ICMEs), that are generally preceded by the occur-
rence of major coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun.
Many ICMEs are likely to be associated with an MC depend-
ing on the trajectory of spacecraft (Xie et al. 2013). It is now
believed and shown from a variety of independent studies that
MCs are magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs) of locally straight cylin-
drical geometry (Burlaga 1988; Farrugia et al. 1995; Shodhan
et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2008; Gopalswamy et al. 2013; Hu et al.
2014). In this picture, the MC is thought to be part of a large-
scale bent ﬂux rope extending from the Sun into interplanetary
space with its feet possibly still connected to the Sun (Burlaga
1991; Farrugia et al. 1993; Bothmer & Schwenn 1998; Webb
et al. 2000). From this point of Sun-Earth connection, a major
interesting, important question is how the solar source regions
are connected to the in situ MCs, which should lead to impor-
tant clues on how to forecast the internal magnetic ﬁeld of
CMEs around Earth and other planets.

Towards this scientiﬁc aspect, MCs are mostly studied from
in situ one-dimensional observations.Various ﬁtting models
have been developed to reconstruct the global picture of MCs
in two or three dimensions (e.g., Lepping et al. (1990); Hu

vemareddy@iiap.res.in

& Sonnerup (2002); Al-Haddad et al. (2013); Janvier et al.
(2015)). On the other hand, the solar source regions are stud-
ied for the onset of the CME (Moore et al. 2001; Forbes et al.
2006; Kliem & Török 2006; Chen 2011; Cheng et al. 2012;
Vemareddy et al. 2012b; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014) and its
propagation is tracked from Sun to near Earth using various
space based observations to conﬁrm the connection of solar
source regions with MCs (Gopalswamy et al. 2001a; Manoha-
ran 2006; Davies et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2010a,b; Temmer et al.
2012; Harrison et al. 2012; Möstl et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013;
Webb et al. 2013; Möstl et al. 2014; Vemareddy & Mishra
2015). Although, at the two ends, we thus enhanced our un-
derstanding in connecting MCs at 1AU to the Sun in many
cases (Gopalswamy et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2013), relating the
source region signatures to magnetic properties in MCs re-
main still lacking.

The commonly recognized plasma structures as ﬂux ropes
in magnetically active regions (ARs) on the Sun include ﬁl-
aments, sigmoids and erupting loops. As direct magnetic
observations of the coronal ﬂux ropes are not possible, the
amount and distribution of twist in the ﬂux ropes are inferred
generally, as a proxy, from photospheric magnetic ﬁeld ob-
servations (Pevtsov et al. 1995; Hagino & Sakurai 2004; Ve-
mareddy et al. 2012a). Furthermore, there is a great difﬁ-
culty in identifying an unambiguous one-to-one association
between the MC and its solar progenitor due to CME-CME
interactions (Gopalswamy et al. 2001b; Burlaga et al. 2002;
Lugaz et al. 2005; Möstl et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012, 2014b,a;
Harrison et al. 2012; Temmer et al. 2012; Mishra et al. 2015),

CME-deﬂection (Wang et al. 2004, 2014; Liewer et al. 2015;
Möstl et al. 2015), or multiple Earth facing ARs. There-
fore, before associating the magnetic signatures from the solar
source region to the in situ MC, it has to be assured that the
MC is uniquely identiﬁed from its source region.

Given the model of ﬂux rope conﬁguration to the in situ
MCs (Lepping et al. 1990), the total ﬁeld line lengths at
the MC boundary must be larger than at the center. This
is a fundamental physical point to help assess the ﬂux rope
model of Sun-Earth connecting MCs. Based on this point,
following the approach of Larson et al. (1997), Kahler et al.
(2011b,a) compared the total ﬁeld line lengths derived from
the energetic electron beam spectrum, with that derived from
Lundquist and ﬂux conservation models. Their comparison,
in a set of WIND MC events, implied a poor correlation be-
tween measured and modelled ﬁeld line lengths, indicating
doubt on the Lundquist ﬂux rope concept to the MCs. Re-
cently, this issue has been further clariﬁed by the study of
Hu et al. (2015), where they employed the Grad-Shafranov
(GS; Hu & Sonnerup 2002) reconstruction technique for the
MC’s magnetic structure. It had been shown that the MC’s
magnetic structure is more aligned with constant twist Gold-
Hoyle model (Gold & Hoyle 1960) but not with Lundquist
model which features increasing twist from the axis of the
ﬂux rope to its boundary. In addition, there were difﬁculties
to ﬁnd comparable magnetic parameters in the MC magnetic
structure and its source regions. In a study of twelve inter-
planetary MCs, Leamon et al. (2004) found the MC magnetic
ﬂux to be comparable to that of the associated AR. They used
cylindrically symmetric constant α Lundquist model to derive
the ﬁeld line twist, total current, total magnetic ﬂux from in
situ observations of MC. However, the total ﬁeld twists of the
MCs were about an order of magnitude larger than those of the
ARs. These ﬁndings led them to believe that MCs associated
with AR eruptions are formed by magnetic reconnection be-
tween these regions and their larger-scale surroundings, rather
than simple eruption of preexisting structures in the corona or
chromosphere.

In the present paper, we study the source region magnetic
properties of an MC event observed on April 14, 2013 us-
ing in situ observations from the Advanced Composition Ex-
plorer (ACE) and solar source AR measurements from the So-
lar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Studies of its solar origins
on initiation, eruption mechanisms unambiguously revealed
build-up and onset of a sigmoidal ﬂux rope to a large scale
CME eruption facing Earth from AR 11719 (Vemareddy &
Zhang 2014). Further connections of this CME eruption to
our MC of interest are uncovered by another detailed study
by tracking the CME to near Earth environment (Vemareddy
& Mishra 2015).

Motivated by many previous studies (e.g., Larson et al.
1997; Leamon et al. 2004; Möstl et al. 2009; Kahler et al.
2011b,a; Hu et al. 2014, 2015), in an attempt to provide fur-
ther details about the in situ magnetic structure of ﬂux ropes
and their Sun-Earth connections of major solar eruptions, we
employ the GS reconstruction technique and then compare
the MC’s orientation and magnetic signatures with its solar
source region (Liu et al. 2010b; Nieves-Chinchilla et al. 2012;
Liu et al. 2016). Moreover, the GS reconstruction results are
compared with the cylindrically symmetric linear force-free
Lundquist model and the non-linear force-free Gold-Hoyle
model ﬁtting results in order to assess the differences in the
estimated ﬁtting parameters. In Section 2, we present the ob-
servations of the solar source region of the magnetic ﬂux rope.

The results of GS reconstruction from in situ MC observa-
tions are described in Section 3, and its magnetic signatures
are compared to that from the source region in Section 5. In
section 4, the MC ﬁtting based models are discussed in con-
junction with GS reconstruction. Conclusions are highlighted
with a possible discussion in Section 6.

2. SOURCE ACTIVE REGION OF CME ERUPTION
The MC’s source region on the Sun is AR 11719. From
this AR, a halo CME eruption occurred on April 11, 2013 at
06:50UT. At this moment, the AR is located at N9E13. The
AR consists of a ﬁlament channel which is overlaid by an
inverse-S sigmoid (see Figure 1). Regarding this sigmoid as
an MFR system, exceedingly critical twist in the MFR (kink
instability) is interpreted as an initiation mechanism of the
eruption at 06:50UT preceded by a GOES class M6.6 ﬂare
(see more details in Vemareddy & Zhang 2014). Moreover, a
torus instability (Török & Kliem 2005) is evidenced as a later
mechanism to further drive the CME eruption.

Figure 1(left panel) shows the vector magnetic ﬁeld mea-
surements of the AR by Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Schou et al. 2012; Hoeksema et al. 2014; Centeno et al. 2014)
on board SDO. The AR consists of a main sunspot (inset)
from which the sigmoid (right panel) originates and lies along
the polarity inversion line between negative in the north and
positive ﬂux in the south. Magnetic ﬁelds are evolving with
decreasing ﬂux content in both polarities for three days pre-
ceding the eruption. Magnetic ﬁelds in the sunspot from
which the sigmoid originates clearly show left-handed orien-
tation. Using these vector magnetic ﬁeld observations, we
calculate the average value of the force free parameter (αav)
given by

αav =

(cid:80) Jz(x, y)sign[Bz(x, y)]
(cid:80) |Bz|

(1)

where Jz(x, y) = 1
µ0

(∇ × B(x, y))z is the vertical current dis-
tribution. As the local distribution of α(x, y)(Jz(x, y)/Bz(x, y))
measures the extent of twist of the ﬁeld lines due to ﬁeld-
aligned currents, its average αav is a proxy to quantify the
overall twist of entire AR magnetic structure (Hagino & Saku-
rai 2004). Its value at the start (00:00UT) of April 11, is calcu-
lated as −0.3 × 10−8m−1 and found to increase predominantly
to around −2 × 10−8m−1 by 12:00UT on April 11. The nega-
tive value of αav indicates left-handed magnetic ﬁeld twist in
the AR and hence a dominant negative helicity. This is well
consistent with the observed geometry of the inverse-S shaped
coronal sigmoid.

As further studied in Vemareddy & Mishra (2015), the dis-
appearing net ﬂux was suggested to help in sustaining and de-
veloping the sigmoid with increasing twist. Localized twist
measurements from vector magnetograms also support the
availability of critical twist (more than one turn within the arc
length of the sigmoid, see Figure 7 in Vemareddy & Zhang
2014) in the sigmoid before the onset of the eruption. This
critical twist is crucial for the onset of initial rise motion as a
mechanism of the kink-instability (Török & Kliem 2005).

The tilt of the sigmoid (referred as MFR) is 45o to the
the ﬂuxrope axis makes an angle of
central meridian, i.e.
roughly 225o to the solar north in counter-clockwise direc-
tion (See schematic in Figure 3). This value of the tilt angle,
in combination with other source region parameters, visually
ﬁts the observed CME morphology captured in the STEREO
and LASCO ﬁeld of view to a good extent (Vemareddy &

Mishra 2015). As this CME is a halo and Earth directed, its
arrival at L1 point is identiﬁed with a shock (on 13 April,
22:50UT), leading edge (on 14 April 14:35UT), and trailing
edge (on 15 April 17:50UT) with the characteristics of a MC
from the in situ velocity and magnetic ﬁeld measurements.
As studied in Vemareddy & Mishra (2015), the in-situ param-
eters interpret a tilt angle of 360o with respect to solar north
in anti-clock direction. This mismatch in the orientation of
the MFR (difference of roughly 135o tilt angle) in the source
region and in the in-situ MC could well be due to the rota-
tion of the MFR apex during its initiation and/or propagation
(Liu et al. 2010b; Vourlidas et al. 2011). As predicted by nu-
merical and observational studies (Fan & Gibson 2003; Green
et al. 2007; Lynch et al. 2009), the apices of MFRs would ro-
tate due to inherent twist in them, left handed helical ones in
counter clockwise direction and right handed in clockwise di-
rection. In our case of left handed MFR, a counterclockwise
rotation is expected.

As seen in Figure 1, the MFR axial ﬁeld is pointing in the
lower right (southwest), because MFR poloidal ﬁeld is com-
ing out of the photosphere in the south and going into the pho-
tosphere in the north of the magnetic neutral line. For such a
poloidal ﬁeld, a left handed MFR has an axis to the south-
west. Therefore, the presumed MFR rotation would be coun-
terclockwise roughly on the order of 135o to match the in situ
ﬂux rope orientation (see Figure 3). Resolving the source re-
gion signatures of MFRs is essential for their Sun-Earth con-
nections as observationally tracking the magnetic structure of
the CME has not yet been made possible.

3. GS RECONSTRUCTION OF MC MAGNETIC

STRUCTURE
We employed the GS reconstruction technique (Hu & Son-
nerup 2002) to construct the magnetic ﬁeld structure in the

MC cross-section. This technique involves an assumption of
translational symmetry of magnetic ﬁeld along the ﬂuxrope
and so enables us to construct the ﬁeld in a 2D cross-section
with an invariant z-axis. The required in situ magnetic and
velocity ﬁeld observations (in GSE coordinate system) of the
MC are obtained from ACE. In Figure 2, we show various ob-
served parameters with time, during the MC passage through
the spacecraft. A MC passage is generally identiﬁed by a
strong magnetic ﬁeld strength, low plasma β (=2µ0 p/B2), ro-
tation of any magnetic ﬁeld component (reversal of sign dur-
ing passage). As an outcome of the application of the GS
method, we set the time interval between 15:56UT on April
14 [day of year as 104] and 17:56UT April 15 [day of year as
105], indicating its large size. Note the By component changes
sign from positive to negative, while Bx and Bz components
remain positive during this MC passage. This means that this
MC belongs to east-north-west (ENW) category according to
the classiﬁcation schemes introduced by Bothmer & Schwenn
(1998) and Mulligan et al. (1998).

Recovering the magnetic ﬁeld in the MC cross-section es-
sentially involves determining the deHoffmannTeller (HT)
frame and orientation of the MC axis (Hu & Sonnerup 2002).
Minimization of the mean square convective electric ﬁeld in a
moving frame gives the velocity of the HT frame (VHT ) as 414
km/s. Minimum variance analysis (MVA) of magnetic ﬁeld
vectors and construction of residue maps determined the ex-
act MC axis orientation pointing at 72o latitude (θ) and 101o
longitude(φ). φ is the longitude, being 0o towards GSE X,
+90o towards GSE Y and so on. θ is the latitude, can also
be called inclination, that is 0o in the ecliptic, +90o towards
ecliptic north (along GSE +Z) and −90o to ecliptic south (GSE
−Z). We point that the latitude of 72o refers to an alignment of
MC axis with respect to the ecliptic. In other words, it is away
from the ecliptic North (vertical plane to ecliptic) by 18o. This

signatures are identiﬁed by the low plasma β, high magnetic pressure, and rotation of By component of the magnetic ﬁeld.

is consistent with the interpreting arguments by Vemareddy
& Mishra (2015), where they speculate a possible rotation of
MFR apex up to 135o due to inherent nature of handedness
of magnetic ﬁeld in the MFR. In this case, left handed he-
licity of magnetic ﬁeld in the MFR might lead to a rotation
in counterclockwise direction (as seen in line-of-sight) during
its outward propagation, tending to align the MFR axis plane
roughly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Particularly from
the source region observations, the apex is likely rotated by
about 117o(45o + 72o) to match the GS result of MC axis ori-
entation. Schematic in Figure 3 depicts the above described
orientation of the in situ and source region MFR with respect
to the ecliptic plane. We believe that the MC axis orienta-
tion is a crucial physical parameter and provides constraining
clues on the Sun-Earth connection of MFRs.

Next, the measurements of transverse pressure Pt(A), which
is a sum of plasma pressure p and axial magnetic pressure
B2
z /2µ0, are re-sampled onto a grid of 17 points using an anti-
aliasing re-sample function, and are then ﬁtted with a second
order polynomial as shown in Figure 4(right). A residue value
R f = 0.08 quantitatively describes the goodness of ﬁt to the
most data points. The resulting reconstructed map of MC’s
cross-section is plotted as contours of ﬂux function (A) and

ﬁlled contour plot of Bz in color with a scale (left panel in
Figure 4). The white thick contour refers to the MC bound-
ary used for calculating the magnetic ﬂuxes, which is based
on the point of divergence of the inbound and outbound Pt(A)
functions at the value of Ab in the right panel. This contains
a slightly smaller interval than the MC interval as given by
the boundaries in Figure 2. Closed contours of A represent
helical ﬁeld lines winding the axis in projection. The MC is
larger than earlier studied cases (Hu & Sonnerup 2002; Möstl
et al. 2009) having a size of 0.26 AU. The closest distance
of the spacecraft from the MC axis is 0.034AU on the posi-
tive y-side. This cross sectional map could be inﬂuenced by
a possible MC expansion. Leading and trailing edges of MC
are moving at a velocity of 461.4 and 376.7 km/s respectively.
The ratio of MC expansion velocity Vexp(=(leading-trailing)
edge velocity/2) and VHT is 0.102, which is feeble to a sig-
niﬁcant expansion effect. The Bz distribution is positive with
a maximum ﬁeld strength of 13 nT. The transverse (Bx, By
components) magnetic components show a left hand winding
of ﬁeld lines in the MC and therefore the helicity is negative
consistent with the source region (Figure 1). GS result of var-
ious parameters of the MC are summarized in Table 5.

to 1.2 turns/AU in within a few units of ﬂux function (radius).
From there, the twist number shows slight increase to 1.75
turns/AU and continues further till the MC boundary.

In this section, we present MC ﬁtting results from two dif-
ferent cylindrical conﬁguration in order to compare with GS
results.

3.1. Gold-Hoyle versus Lundquist models
We ﬁtted the in situ magnetic ﬁeld observations with the
cylindrically symmetric linear force-free ﬂux rope model
(Lundquist 1950) with radial functions of axial and poloidal
ﬁeld components

Bz(r) = B0BesselJ(0, αr)
Bϕ(r) = HB0BesselJ(1, αr)

(3)

where α is force-free parameter, H is the sign of helicity and
B0 is ﬁeld strength. In this model, the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle
along the spacecraft’s observational path is determined by the
orientation of the ﬂux rope axis i.e., z-axis which is given by
the elevation and azimuth angle (θ and φ), closest approach of
the observational path p, ﬂux rope diameter D, helicity sign H
and ﬁeld strength B0 in the center of the ﬂux rope (Lepping
et al. 1990; Leitner et al. 2007). As a second ﬂux-rope ﬁtting
model, we used the non-linear force-free Gold-Hoyle model
(GH; Gold & Hoyle 1960) assuming a uniform ﬁeld line twist
(e.g. Farrugia et al. 1999; Dasso et al. 2006; Hu et al. 2015).
In this model, the radial functions of axial and poloidal ﬁeld
components are

Bz(r) =

Bϕ(r) =

B0
2r2
1 + T0
HT0B0r
2r2
1 + T0

(4)

where T0 is twist number at the center. The ﬁtting converges
when T0 = 1.2 turns/AU rather the GS result of T0 = 9 turns/AU
because the rest of GH is totally consistent with GS.

Figure 7 shows the results of the Lundquist model ﬁtting
(solid red) and the Gold-Hoyle model ﬁtting (dashed blue) to
the in situ magnetic ﬁeld observations (black). The vertical
lines mark the edges of the magnetic ﬂux rope. As a mea-
sure of goodness of the ﬁt, we compute the root mean square
(Bo(ti) − Bm(ti))2/N ) between the ob-
deviation (rms=

served magnetic ﬁeld (Bo(ti)) and the modelled ﬁeld (Bm(ti))
(Marubashi & Lepping 2007). As can be noticed, both mod-
els reproduce the global trend of the ﬁeld components, espe-
cially the rotating component, quite well. However, the GH
conﬁguration performs slightly better in terms of Erms pa-
rameter (Erms = rms/max(|B|)). It is 0.266 for the Lundquist
and 0.175 for the GH ﬁt. The resulting orientation of the ﬂux
rope for both models is almost same. The helicity sign H and
the ﬁeld strength B0, inclination angle are in agreement with
the GS reconstruction results however, other parameters dif-
fer considerably. The derived parameters are listed against the
GS values in Table 5.

The radial proﬁle of GS inferred τ is compared with that
by the GH and Lundquist models (Figure 6). For this pur-
pose, the GS derived ﬁeld strength (B0 = 13nT ), twist (T0 = 9
turns/AU=56.5radians/AU) and radius (R0 = 0.26AU) are sup-
plied to Equations 3 and 4. The Lundquist ﬂux rope model
implies increasingly varying τ from the axis, whereas the GH

cross-section, we can quantify the twist of the ﬁeld lines (Hu
et al. 2014). As the closed contours of the ﬂux function A
represent ﬁeld lines of one/more turns in the plane projection,
the same can be realized by integrating ﬁeld lines at any radial
position from the axis of the MFR. The axial length (L) of any
such ﬁeld line which completes one full turn has a relation to
the twist number

turns/AU

L

An involved assumption in the above equation is that the
MC structure does not change, i.e., translational symmetry,
along the full length of the rope. In Figure 5, we have plotted
ﬁeld lines in different radial positions from the center of the
MC. By the nature of twist, the ﬁeld lines wind about the axis
in each ﬂux shell. These ﬁeld lines give an impression of a
locally straight section of a large scale bent ﬂux rope, which
is constituted by ﬂux shells. Note that the central ﬁeld line
(axis) is almost straight. We then measure the axial length
of each ﬁeld line that completes one full turn about the axis.
The twist number in three different radial directions from the
axis (i.e. A0) is plotted as a function of shifted ﬂux function
|A − A0| in Figure 6. In the three different radial directions,
starting from 9 turns/AU, τ declines rapidly from the center

model gives a constant twist from centre to the boundary of
the ﬂux rope. This kind of τ variation was also found in some
case studies of Hu et al. (2014). GH conﬁguration is thus
inferred to be more consistent with the general behaviour of
ﬁeld line turns in the GS result of the MCŠs magnetic struc-
ture.

Since the Lundquist ﬁt infers the radius of MC as 0.135 AU,
2π = 2.405
the twist number is (T0 = α
0.135×2π turns/AU ) estimated
to be 2.83 turns/AU. In the GH ﬁtting, the twist serves as an
additional ﬁtting parameter, so the ﬁtting directly results in
1.2 turns/AU. Therefore, the result of about one turn from GH
result is quite consistent for most of the GS twist (ﬂat value

of 1.75) results in Figure 6. This inference is based on one
event, however a better ﬁt, in most of the cases especially the
rotating component, is generally expected from the GH model
ﬁtting than the Lundquist model ﬁtting due to the internal ﬁeld
conﬁguration.

3.2. Gold-Hoyle versus Lundquist models with expansion

effect

While the spacecraft traverses the MC, it undergoes expan-
sion signiﬁcantly in a time scale of a day. To account this
expansion in the ﬁtting, Farrugia et al. (1992) proposed a self
similar expansion model to the MC. This model was later ap-
plied to cylinder and torus geometry by Marubashi & Lepping

of solar release times as bursts and their 1 AU onset times
in the form of type III radio emission. Recently, Hu et al.
(2015) utilized these procedures and showed that the in situ
measurements of ﬁeld line lengths are consistent with a ﬂux
rope structure with spiral ﬁeld lines of constant and low twist.
Based on their analysis of a limited number of MC events,
they argued that under most circumstances, the effective axial
length of a cylindrical ﬂux rope is Le f f ∈ [1, 2] AU. They sug-
gested to adopt this range of ﬁeld line axial length for the rel-
evant studies of deriving and relating various physical quanti-
ties to their solar sources.

Considering the ﬁeld lines of total length L = 1 − 2AU, the
GS based MC twist distribution ((αL)MC) comes out to be
1.75-18.00 turns, reﬂecting the full variation from the center
to the edge in Figure 6. Note that (αL)MC can also be referred
as (τ L)MC. Now in the source region, given the distance of
66 Mm (see Figure 1, and also, Vemareddy & Zhang (2014)
between the legs of the sigmoidal ﬂux rope, assuming a half
torus shape, the average length of the ﬁeld lines in the sig-
moidal ﬂux rope would be 103 Mm. The average twist from
the sunspot, where one of the legs of sigmoidal ﬂux rope lies,
at the time of eruption is estimated as −4.16 ± 0.32 × 10−8m−1.
This results in an AR twist distribution ((αL)AR) of 0.7 turns
which is less by a factor of three with the range of (αL)MC.
Note a 2π factor when referring (αL)AR in units of turns. We
note that α values in the sunspot region are distributed in the
range (10−7 − 10−6)m−1. Since the twist distribution in the GS-
based MC is derived from the local magnetic ﬁeld distribu-
tion, we argue to use the local range of α in the source AR
too. By doing so, we arrive (αL)AR as 1.6-16 turns, which is
well within the range of (αL)MC. Note that we followed the
same procedures of Leamon et al. (2004), who found differing
MC’s twist distribution of an order compared to their source
regions. They assumed L = 2.5AU for the computation. Their
result could likely be due to the use of average α over the en-
tire AR and also less resolution magnetic ﬁeld observations.
Indeed, this is the case here (0.16 turns) for the entire AR
value (αav = 1.0 × 10−8m−1, see Table 5). Note that high reso-
lution, high sensitive magnetic ﬁeld observations will always
improve the AR twist estimation with higher magnitude. It is
thus obvious that even the moderate values 0.5 × 10−7m−1 of
AR twist distribution would be comparable with the most of
the twist distribution in MC cross-section.

The ratio of axial ﬂux (0.46 × 1021Mx) from the MC and
from the source sunspot region (3 × 1021Mx) is 0.15. Simi-
larly, the net current ratio is 0.34 × 10−3. These values are typ-
ical and consistent with the cases presented in Leamon et al.
(2004). From both the ﬁttings with and without expansion,
due to the increasing twist from center to the boundary, the
Lundquist ﬁt converges at higher value of twist number for
the MC than that from GH ﬁtting. As of this fact, the poloidal
ﬂux in Lundquist ﬁtting is signiﬁcantly higher (by a factor
2.5) than axial ﬂux.

6. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We have analysed in situ observed MC and its solar source
region in an effort to emphasize the ﬂux rope connections of
Sun and Earth. Magnetic ﬂux ropes play prime role in the
Sun-Earth connections during major solar eruptive events like
CMEs. The MC structures are accepted to be the part of large
scale bent ﬂux rope with legs still having connections to the
solar source AR. The solar AR 11719 is found to be the source
region of the observed MC during April 14-15, 2013. The

FIG. 6.— Twist number as a function of shifted ﬂux function in three dif-
ferent (each color for each direction) radial directions from the axis of the
MC. Twist number rapidly falls from 9 turns/AU at the axis to stabilize to a
constant twist number of 1.75 turns/AU upto the MC boundary.

(2007). In this model, the radius of the MC (cylinder, Equa-
tions 3 and 4) varies with time (t) as r(t) = r0(1 + Et) where
E is the expansion rate, by which means force-free param-
eter α is time varying while being spatially constant. And
the magnetic ﬁeld components also inversely proportional to
(1 + Et)2. The model relies on the observed data of solar wind
in addition to magnetic ﬁeld components, and the MC ﬁtting
determines E, the average solar wind velocity U0, along with
other parameters as in the models without expansion. Follow-
ing this ﬁtting procedure described in Marubashi & Lepping
(2007, Appendix A), the results for GH and Lundquist con-
ﬁgurations are plotted in Figure 8. And the ﬁtted parameters
are listed in Table 5.

During the ﬁtting procedure, we set U0 to the VHT frame ve-
locity (414 km/s) for both the conﬁgurations. In the Lundquist
conﬁguration, the MC radius (r0 = 0.12 AU) yields T0 = 3.19
turns/AU. Whereas for GH conﬁguration,
the ﬁtting con-
verges (especially the rotating component) when T0 = 1.1
turns/AU. This is a consequence of reducing twist number
from the centre towards the MC boundary to a uniform level
of 1.75 turns/AU and the expansion effect mimics it to repro-
duce the observations. The expansion coefﬁcient (0.22 per
day) is signiﬁcant that the initial MC radius increases by 25%
at the time of the spacecraft passes the MC rear boundary.
The orientation differs signiﬁcantly in φ (132o) with a simi-
lar θ as GS method. The rms deviation between the observed
and model magnetic ﬁelds for the Lundquist and GH ﬁts are
26.1, 1.91 respectively, which delineates the goodness of GH
ﬁt over the earlier.

4. MC FITTING
5. COMPARISON OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES IN THE

MC AND THE SOURCE AR
To compare the AR twist with that of the MC, the total ﬁeld
line length is required, as direct comparison of twist param-
eter is not suitable because ﬁeld lines stretch while ﬂux rope
structure expands. Kahler et al. (2011b) derived total ﬁeld
line lengths by using solar energetic particles, like electrons,
of known speeds. The procedure requires the observations

pre-eruptive AR has a well-developed inverse-S sigmoidal
ﬂux rope under the evolving conditions of cancelling and ap-
proaching ﬂux regions. This sigmoidal ﬂux rope erupted on
6:50UT on April 11, 2013 and launched a halo CME directed

at an average speed of 861km/s towards Earth.

Utilising the in situ magnetic ﬁeld observations, we exam-
ined the magnetic structure of the ﬂux rope by the GS recon-
struction method. The MC axis points at 72o latitude (θ ) and

101o longitude (φ ) in the GSE system, where the latitude de-
termines the deviation of the MC axis from the zenith. Since
the source region sigmoid is aligned at 225o from the ecliptic
north, a possible rotation of the apex of the ﬂux rope (upto
117o, Green et al. 2007; Lynch et al. 2009) in its expansion
during CME eruption, could result in such a predicted axis
orientation of 72o latitude. The axial ﬁeld (Bz) in the MC
structure is positive (northward) with a left handed twist con-
sistent with the source region sigmoid morphology and mag-
netic ﬁeld distribution.

This MC magnetic structure has a ﬁeld line twist number

of 9 turns/AU at the center, which is decreasing to a ﬂat value
of 1.75 turns/AU upto the boundary. As also found in a hand-
ful of cases by Hu et al. (2014, 2015), this inferred ﬁeld line
turns from the GS method is more consistent with the con-
stant twist GH conﬁguration rather the Lundquist conﬁgura-
tion of increasing twist from the axis of the ﬂux rope to its
boundary. Because of this reason, the GS magnetic structure
is non-linear force-free and hence it would be more appropri-
ate to use GH magnetic conﬁguration to ﬁt the in situ mag-
netic ﬁelds for estimating parameters of cylindrically sym-
metric MC structures.

Vemareddy et al

For more clues on the connections of source region, we
compared source region magnetic properties with the GS
based MC magnetic structure. The net absolute axial ﬂux and
vertical current from source sunspot region are comparatively
small to that from MC. These values are typical and consis-
tent with the cases presented in Leamon et al. (2004). In con-
trast to their ﬁndings, the magnetic twist of the pre-eruptive
AR is comparably in the range of MC’s twist number. Iden-
tifying the anchoring region of the ﬂux rope foot point, high
resolution and high sensitive magnetic ﬁeld observations in
the source region better quantify the twist that manifests the
ﬂux rope. On the other hand, the length of ﬁeld lines in the
MCs is better constrained [1-2 AU] now by previous studies
(i.e. from Hu et al. 2015) and we now have a better grasp of
the MC structure. We suggest to consider the distribution of
α from the source region for its comparison with the in situ
MC.

The cylindrically symmetric Lundquist and Gold-Hoyle
conﬁgurations reproduce the global trend of in situ magnetic
ﬁeld observations especially the rotating component. The re-
sulting orientation of the ﬂux rope for both the models is al-
most the same. The helicity sign H and the ﬁeld strength B0,
inclination angle are in agreement with the GS reconstruction
results. Due to the ﬂat value of twist in the most part the
MC, GH conﬁguration with 1.1 turn/AU resembles the GS
twist value and ﬁts better the observations over the Lundquist
conﬁguration. In fact, these ﬁtting results improved (in terms
of Erms) when considered the self-similar expansion into ac-
count (Marubashi & Lepping 2007). All the results includ-
ing GS method yield the higher poloidal ﬂux than the axial
ﬂux, indicating the twisted nature of ﬁeld lines in the MC.
Due to increasing twist proﬁle from center to boundary, the
Lundquist ﬁt estimates higher twist and poloidal ﬂux than the
GH ﬁt. The GS reconstruction provides clues on the MC twist
structure, which for the ﬁrst time, ﬁtted with GH conﬁgura-
tion as an alternative to general practice of Lundquist conﬁg-

uration. Although the ﬁtting improved to a great extent, it is
yet to see, in a large sample of data sets, the goodness of GH
ﬁtting (including the expansion effect) in characterising the
properties of in situ MC structures and its source region links.
In conclusion, the connection of the active region to the
magnetic cloud is unambiguous. The length of the ﬁeld lines,
both in the MC and in the source region sigmoid, is better con-
strained for a quantitative comparison of source region mag-
netic signatures in the in situ MC. The ﬁtting procedures de-
termines the lower twist values away from the MFR center.
These are the important points that have hindered in the pre-
vious studies on deﬁnite conclusions of how the twist behaves
in magnetic ﬂux ropes on the Sun and at 1 AU. For such twist-
ing behaviour, this study suggests an alternative ﬁtting proce-
dure to better characterise the MC magnetic structure. These
two points opens up the possibility to predict the MC twist
conﬁguration from the solar imaging information, which is of
very high relevance to understanding the origin of the CME
magnetic ﬁeld (and its Bz) and thus space weather prediction
in general.
