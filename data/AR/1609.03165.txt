ABSTRACT

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C3.1 circular-

ribbon ﬂare SOL2015-10-16T10:20 in active region (AR) 12434. The ﬂare con-

sisted of a circular ﬂare ribbon (CFR), an inner ﬂare ribbon (IFR) inside, and

a pair of short parallel ﬂare ribbons (PFRs). The PFRs located to the north

of IFR were most striking in the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS )

1400 ˚A and 2796 ˚A images. For the ﬁrst time, we observed the circular-ribbon

ﬂare in the Ca ii H line of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard Hinode,

which has similar shape as observed in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)

1600 ˚A aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Photospheric line-of-sight

magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO

show that the ﬂare was associated with positive polarities and a negative polarity

inside. The IFR and CFR were cospatial with the negative polarity and posi-

tive polarities, implying the existence of a magnetic null point (B=0) and the

dome-like spine-fan topology. During the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, “two-step”

raster observations of IRIS with a cadence of 6 s and an exposure time of 2 s show

plasma downﬂow at the CFR in the Si iv λ1402.77 line (log T ≈ 4.8), suggesting

chromospheric condensation. The downﬂow speeds ﬁrst increased rapidly from

a few km s−1 to the peak values of 45−52 km s−1, before decreasing gradually

to the initial levels. The decay timescales of condensation were 3−4 minutes, in-

dicating ongoing magnetic reconnection. Interestingly, the downﬂow speeds are

positively correlated with logarithm of the Si iv line intensity and time derivative

of the GOES soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux in 1−8 ˚A. The radio dynamic spectra are

characterized by a type III radio burst associated with the ﬂare, which implies

that the chromospheric condensation was most probably driven by nonthermal

electrons. Using an analytical expression and the peak Doppler velocity, we de-

– 3 –

rived the lower limit of energy ﬂux of the precipitating electrons, i.e., 0.65×1010

erg cm−2 s−1. The Si iv line intensity and SXR derivative show quasi-periodic

pulsations with periods of 32−42 s, which are likely caused by intermittent null-

point magnetic reconnections modulated by the fast wave propagating along the

fan surface loops at a phase speed of 950−1250 km s−1. Periodic accelerations

and precipitations of the electrons result in periodic heating observed in the Si

iv line and SXR.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares are one of the most spectacular activities in the solar system. Up to

1029−1032 ergs magnetic free energies are impulsively released, accompanied by rapid

increases of emissions in various wavelengths (Shibata & Magara 2011). It is generally

believed that magnetic reconnection plays a key role in the reconﬁguration of magnetic

ﬁeld lines and conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energies of plasma

(Forbes & Acton 1996; Priest & Forbes 2000). In the context of standard solar ﬂare

model (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), the

accelerated nonthermal electrons propagate downward and heat the chromosphere, forming

the bright ﬂare ribbons in Hα, Ca ii H, ultraviolet (UV), and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)

wavelengths. The ﬂare ribbons have diverse shapes, with two parallel ﬂare ribbons

(PFRs) being the most commonplace (Li & Zhang 2015). Sometimes, circular ﬂare

ribbons (CFRs) appear accompanied by remote brightenings, which is generally believed

to be associated with a magnetic null point (B=0) and the dome-like spine-fan topology

(Masson et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Pontin et al. 2016). More complex ﬂare ribbons

have also been observed (Joshi et al. 2015). Apart from the localized heating, hard X-ray

(HXR) emissions are generated via Coulomb collisions (Brown 1971). If open magnetic

ﬁeld lines are involved, it is likely that the nonthermal electrons at speeds of 0.06−0.25c

(c is the speed of light) escape the Sun into the interplanetary space and generate type

III radio bursts with frequency ranging from 0.2 to hundreds of MHz (Dulk et al. 1987;

Aschwanden et al. 1995; Zhang et al. 2015). Sometimes, the HXR and radio emissions of a

ﬂare show quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), with their periods ranging from milliseconds

(Tan et al. 2010) through a few seconds (Kliem et al. 2000; Asai et al. 2001; Ning et al.

– 5 –

2005; Nakariakov et al. 2010; Hayes et al. 2016) to several minutes (Ofman & Sui 2006;

Sych et al. 2009; Nakariakov & Melnikov 2009; Ning 2014). So far, QPPs have been

extensively explored using both imaging (Su et al. 2012a,b) and spectral observations

(Mariska 2005). Li et al. (2015b) studied the X1.6 ﬂare on 2014 September 10. Four-minute

QPPs are evident not only in the HXR, EUV, UV, and radio light curves, but also in

the temporal evolutions of the Doppler velocities and line widths of the C i, O iv, Si

iv, and Fe xxi lines. Brosius & Daw (2015) studied the M7.3 ﬂare on 2014 April 18.

The chromospheric and transition region line emissions show quasi-periodic intensity and

velocity ﬂuctuations with periods of ∼3 minutes during the ﬁrst four peaks and ∼1.5

minutes during the last four peaks.

The overpressure of the chromosphere drives evaporation of hot and dense plasma

upward into the newly reconnected coronal loops at speeds of tens to hundreds of km

s−1 (Fisher et al. 1985a,b,c). At the same time, downward chromospheric condensation

takes place at speeds of a few to tens of km s−1 as a result of the balance of momentum

(Teriaca et al. 2003). In the past 40 years, the investigations of chromospheric evaporation

and condensation have greatly beneﬁtted from the spectroscopic observations in Hα

and EUV wavelengths from the ground-based as well as space-borne telescopes (e.g.,

Czaykowska et al. 1999; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Chen & Ding 2010; Li & Ding 2011;

Milligan 2011; Young et al. 2013; Tian et al. 2014, 2015; Li et al. 2015a; Polito et al.

2015, 2016; Battaglia et al. 2015; Graham & Cauzzi 2015). Ichimoto & Kurokawa (1984)

studied the red asymmetry of Hα line proﬁles of 4 ﬂares near the disk center. The ﬁrst

two on June 20 and June 21 in 1982 were indeed circular-ribbon ﬂares. The red-shifted

emission streaks of Hα line are caused by the conspicuous downward motion in the ﬂare

chromospheric region with velocities of 40−100 km s−1. Using the spectral data of an M6.8

two-ribbon ﬂare observed by the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) aboard SOHO,

Czaykowska et al. (1999) found that the Fe xvi downward velocity of the regions between

– 6 –

the ﬂare ribbons and the magnetic neutral line decreases from ∼90 km s−1 to ∼15 km

s−1 within 2.5 minutes in the gradual phase, indicating ongoing magnetic reconnection.

Brosius & Phillips (2004) studied an M2.0 ﬂare observed by CDS and found that the

downward velocity of chromospheric condensation in O v line decreases from ∼40 km

s−1 to zero within 3 minutes. Compared with CDS, the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging

Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al. 2007) aboard Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007) covers a much

wider temperature range and has much higher resolution and cadence. Using the spectral

data of a C1.0 ﬂare observed by EIS, Brosius (2013) found that the upward velocities

of chromospheric evaporation in Fe xxiii line decreases from its maximum value (>200

km s−1) to zero within 2 minutes. The successful launch of the Interface Region Imaging

Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014) opened a new era of ﬂare research, thanks to its

unprecedented resolution and cadence. The timescales of chromospheric evaporation range

from 5 to 12 minutes in most cases (Battaglia et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015a; Tian et al. 2015;

Polito et al. 2015, 2016; Graham & Cauzzi 2015). However, it can reach ∼20 minutes in an

M1.0 ﬂare (Sadykov et al. 2016). The timescales of chromospheric condensation range from

1 to 7 minutes (Graham & Cauzzi 2015; Sadykov et al. 2016). A delay of >60 s between the

starting times of condensation and evaporation has been observed (Graham & Cauzzi 2015;

Young et al. 2015). Both the upward evaporation velocities and downward condensation

velocities are positively correlated with the HXR ﬂuxes, which is consistent with the

numerical model of evaporation driven by nonthermal electrons (Tian et al. 2015; Li et al.

2015a).

So far, chromospheric condensation in circular-ribbon ﬂares has rarely been investigated.

Using the imaging and raster observations of a GOES C4.2 circular-ribbon ﬂare on 2015

October 16 by IRIS, Zhang et al. (2016) found explosive chromospheric evaporation during

the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, which is characterized by simultaneous plasma upﬂow

(35−120 km s−1) observed in the high-temperature Fe xxi λ1354.09 line (log T ≈ 7.05) and

– 7 –

downﬂow (10−60 km s−1) observed in the low-temperature Si iv λ1393.77 line (log T ≈ 4.8).

Based on the quantitative estimation of nonthermal energy ﬂux under the thick-target model

and the fact that the inner ﬂare ribbon (IFR) where chromospheric evaporation occurred

was cospatial with the single HXR source at 12−25 keV, the authors concluded that

the explosive chromospheric evaporation was most likely driven by nonthermal electrons

accelerated by magnetic reconnection. However, the IRIS observation was in the “sparse

synoptic raster” mode with a cadence of 9.4×36=338.4 s, which is diﬃcult to study the

temporal evolution of the same position. There were a couple of homologous circular-ribbon

ﬂares in the same active region (AR 12434) on the same day as the C4.2 ﬂare. In this

paper, we study another one, the C3.1 ﬂare observed by IRIS. The raster observation was

in the “two-step raster” mode with a cadence of 6 s, which is quite suitable for investigating

the temporal evolution of the same position of ﬂare ribbon. In addition, we observed QPPs

during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare. In Section 2, we describe the instruments and data

analysis using observations from various telescopes. Results and discussions are presented

in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section 5.

Instruments and data analysis

2.1. SDO and Hinode Observations

The ﬂare was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.

2012) aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) in the full-disk images. AIA has two

UV (1600 ˚A, 1700 ˚A) and 7 EUV ﬁlters, including 304 ˚A (T ≈ 0.05 MK), 171 ˚A (T ≈ 0.63

MK), 193 ˚A (T ≈ 1.5 MK), 211 ˚A (T ≈ 2.0 MK), 335 ˚A (T ≈ 2.5 MK), 94 ˚A (T ≈ 6.3 MK),

and 131 ˚A (T ≈ 0.37 MK and 10 MK). Photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms

of the AR were observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.

2012) aboard SDO. The level 1 data from AIA and HMI were calibrated using the standard

– 8 –

Solar SoftWare (SSW) programs aia prep.pro and hmi prep.pro, respectively. It was also

partially observed by the Ca ii H (∼3968 ˚A) ﬁlter of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT;

Tsuneta et al. 2008) aboard Hinode with a limited ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 218′′ × 109′′.

SOT consists of 4 instruments, including the Broad-band Filter Imager (BFI), Narrow-band

Filter Imager (NFI), Spectropolarimeter (SP), and Correlation Tracker (CT). BFI produces

images in 6 bands (CN bands, Ca ii H, G-band, and 3 continuum bands). The raw BFI

data were calibrated using the SSW program fg prep.pro. The magnetograms and images

observed in Ca ii H, UV, and EUV wavelengths were coaligned with an accuracy of ∼0.′′6.

2.2.

IRIS Observations

The Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) aboard IRIS observed the ﬂare in Si iv λ1400 (T ≈ 0.065

MK) and Mg ii H/K λ2796 (T ≈ 0.01 MK). The raster observation was in the “two-step

raster” mode (OBS ID: 3660105413). As its name implies, each raster had two steps

from east to west with a cadence of 6 s and an exposure time of 2 s, covering an area

of 2′′×128.′′42. Each step had a spatial size of 0.′′3327 and a spectral scale of ∼25.44 m˚A

pixel−1, which equal to ∼5.44 km s−1 pixel−1. The raster data of Si iv λ1402.77 line

(log T ≈ 4.8) were preprocessed using the SSW programs iris orbitvar corr l2.pro and

iris prep despike.pro. Since the intensity of Fe xxi λ1354.09 line was too weak to obtain

convincing line proﬁles, we did not use this line. The Si iv line is an isolated line with

red asymmetry. However, the spectra could not been simply ﬁtted by a single-Gaussian or

double-Gaussian function. To determine the line center (λc) and intensity (I), we use the

same method as described in Brosius & Daw (2015):

integrals. Iλ denotes the intensity at λ.

2.3. Radio Observations

The ﬂare was accompanied by a type III radio burst, which was recorded in the radio

dynamic spectra by the WIND/WAVES (Bougeret et al. 1995) and two ground-based

telescopes1 (KRIM, BLENSW ). WAVES has two detectors: RAD1 (0.02−1.04 MHz) and

RAD2 (1.075−13.825 MHz). The frequency ranges of KRIM and BLENSW are 250−350

MHz and 10−80 MHz, respectively. The observing parameters of the instruments are

summarized in Table 1.

3. Results

3.1. Flare Ribbons

In Figure 1, the AIA 171 ˚A image at 10:17:46 UT is displayed in panel (a). The C3.1

circular-ribbon ﬂare with enhanced emission took place at the center of AR 12434. Panel

(b) shows the HMI LOS magnetogram of the AR at 10:17:45 UT. In order to investigate

the magnetic ﬁeld of the ﬂare, we give a close-up of the region within the dashed box

in panel (d). As mentioned in Zhang et al. (2016), the ﬂare region is characterized by

a central negative polarity (N) surrounded by positive polarities (P). The contours of

the 171 ˚A intensity in panel (a) are superposed with red lines. It is clear that the ﬂare

– 10 –

ribbons were cospatial with the strong magnetic ﬁeld. Like the C4.2 ﬂare, such a magnetic

pattern is strongly indicative of a magnetic null point and the spine-fan conﬁguration in the
corona. The horizontal and vertical length scales of the ﬂare are Lx ≈ 30′′ and Ly ≈ 40′′,

respectively. Assuming a semispherical shape of the fan surface, the height of the null

point and the loop length (L) from the null point to the solar surface are estimated to be
LxLy = 27.′′2, respectively. The height of null point is higher

LxLy = 17.′′3 and π

than that of the coronal bright points on 2007 March 16 (Zhang et al. 2012), but slightly

lower than that of the M6.7 ﬂare on 2011 September 8 (Zhang et al. 2015). Panel (c)

demonstrates the HMI white-light continuum image at 10:17:45 UT, which is characterized

by the dark sunspot and the surrounding plage of the AR.

Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the ﬂare in 304 ˚A. Unlike the C4.2 ﬂare during

13:36−13:51 UT, we did not ﬁnd a preexisting ﬁlament residing in the AR and its eruption

that would result in a blowout jet (Zhang et al. 2016). The ﬂare started brightening from

its southwest part at ∼10:15 UT (see panel (b)). As time goes on, the area of initial

brightening expanded and became more complex, including several patches or kernels (see

panels (d)-(e) and online movie anim304.mpg). Meanwhile, the narrow eastern part of the

ﬂare brightened, forming the CFR as indicated by the arrow in panel (e). After its peak

time around 10:20 UT, the intensity of ﬂare decreased. It is evident that the intensity of

CFR decreased much faster than the IFR inside (see panels (g)-(i)).

In Figure 3, the top two rows demonstrate selected images of the ﬂare in the other AIA

wavelengths with higher formation temperatures (see online animation anim335.mpg). The

evolution is similar to that in 304 ˚A. In panel (d), the contours of the positive and negative

LOS magnetic ﬁelds are overlaid with magenta and orange lines. Like the C4.2 ﬂare, the

CFR was approximately cospatial with positive polarities, while the IFR was approximately

cospatial with negative polarity (Zhang et al. 2016). The hot, bright post-ﬂare loop (PFL)

– 11 –

after being ﬁlled with evaporated material was obvious in 94 ˚A (panel (e)) and 131 ˚A

(panel (f)), which is consistent with the peaks around 10:20 UT in the EUV light curves

(Figure 6(a)). The bottom row shows the CFR and IFR observed in the lower solar

atmosphere (1600 ˚A, Ca ii H, and 1700 ˚A). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of a

circular-ribbon ﬂare observed in Ca ii H. The shape of ribbon is similar to that in 1600 ˚A,

but has ﬁner structure owing to the higher resolution of SOT.

Figure 4 shows the selected 1400 ˚A images during 10:15:15−10:36:10 UT (see online

movie anim1400.mpg). The evolution of the ﬂare is somewhat similar to that in 304 ˚A

in Figure 2, featuring the bright CFR and IFR with ultraﬁne structures (see panel (c)).

Despite that the two ﬁlters have comparable formation temperatures, new features appear

thanks to the high resolution of IRIS. In panel (c), a pair of bright PFRs are located to the

north of IFR. The PFRs are ∼18.′′4 in length, which is much shorter than the CFR. The

brightness of PFRs reached the maximum around 10:17:46 UT before decreasing gradually.

Such a pattern, including the coexisting CFR, IFR, and PFRs, was also observed in the

large-scale M7.3 ﬂare on 2014 April 18 (Joshi et al. 2015). In panel (a), the slit positions

of the two-step raster are drawn with vertical dashed lines (S1 and S2). In panel (d), S1

encounters the CFR at H1 and H2. S2 encounters the CFR at H1* and H2*. The intensity

of H1* is greater than H1, but lower than H2 and H2* in most cases.

Figure 5 shows the selected 2796 ˚A images. The evolution of the ﬂare is similar to that

in 1400 ˚A, featuring the CFR, IFR, and PFRs (see panel (c)). However, the duration of

brightening of the ribbons is much shorter owing to the much lower formation temperature

of 2796 ˚A (T ≈ 0.01 MK).

In Figure 6, the upper panel shows the normalized light curves of the ﬂare in EUV

wavelengths.

It is obvious that all the light curves experienced a sharp peak around

10:17:46 UT simulantously. For the light curve in 131 ˚A, the small peak around 10:17:46 UT

– 12 –

indicates the existence of hot material up to ∼10 MK during the early-impulsive phase of

the ﬂare (Fletcher et al. 2013; Tian et al. 2015). This is also supported by the “step” after

the fast rise in the 94 ˚A light curve. As the chromospheric evaporation proceeds possibly

due to the nonthermal electrons that impact the chromosphere, the coronal loops are ﬁlled

with hot and dense plasmas, which generate strong emissions in the wavelengths with

the highest formation temperatures. This is revealed by the dominant peak at ∼10:20:10

UT in 131 ˚A and the following peak in 94 ˚A. As time goes on, the coronal loops cool

down primarily due to thermal conduction and create peaks of emissions progressively at

decreasing formation temperatures of 335 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 171 ˚A, and 304 ˚A. The cooling

timescale of the ﬂare loops from ∼10 MK to ∼0.6 MK was ∼5 minutes. The lower panel

of Figure 6 shows the soft X-ray (SXR) light curves during 10:10−10:30 UT in 0.5−4 ˚A

(cyan) and 1−8 ˚A (magenta). The ﬂare had a short lifetime of ∼15 minutes. It started at

∼10:15 UT, peaked at ∼10:20 UT, and ended at ∼10:30 UT.

3.2. Chromospheric Condensation at the CFR

In Figure 7, the IRIS spectral window of Si iv for S1 and S2 are displayed in the

left and right panels, respectively. In the top two panels, the white curves represent the

spacetime average spectra between the vertical positions (-270′′ and -230′′) marked by the

two yellow lines during 10:15:21−10:15:43 UT. Despite in the very initial phase of the ﬂare,

the spectra show weak red asymmetry. Hence, a single-Gaussian ﬁtting is still inapplicable.

Using Equation (1) and the spacetime average spectra, the rest wavelength (λ0) of Si iv

λ1402.77 is calculated to be 1402.86±0.0145 ˚A, exactly the same value as in Brosius & Daw

(2015). In panels (c)-(h), the green curves are the spectra at H1 and H1* in three raster

scans. The blue curves are the spectra at H2 and H2* in three raster scans. For H1, the

line proﬁles seem to be slightly blue-shifted, indicating weak plasma upﬂow. For H1*, the

– 13 –

proﬁles are wider than H1 and show red asymmetry, implying plasma downﬂow. For H2

and H2*, the red asymmetry are much more signiﬁcant, suggesting faster downﬂow. The

line centers and intensities at each position along S1 and S2 during the raster are calculated

using Equations (1) and (2). The Doppler velocity (VD) of Si iv line is calculated based on

the distances between line centers and λ0:

VD =

c
λ0

(λc − λ0).

(3)

According to the uncertainty of λ0, the uncertainty of VD is calculated to be 3.11 km s−1.

In Figure 8, the temporal evolutions of the Si iv line intensity and Doppler velocity

along slit S1 are demonstrated in the left panels. The temporal evolutions of the intensity

and Doppler velocity of H1 and H2 are extracted and plotted in the right panels with cyan

and magenta lines. It is clear that outside the CFR, the intensities and VD are far less

than the CFR. The intensities of H1 and H2 increased from 10:15:15 UT and reached the

peak values before decreasing with oscillations. The intensity of H2 was greater than H1

in most cases during the ﬂare. The red-shifted VD of H2 increased quickly and reached
the maximum of ∼45 km s−1 at 10:16:24 UT before decreasing gradually to ∼2 km s−1 at

10:20:29 UT. The timescale of chromospheric condensation of H2 was ∼4 minutes. The VD
of H1 was blue-shifted and ﬂuctuated slightly around -5 km s−1 during most of the lifetime.

The possible cause of coexisting downﬂow and upﬂow along the CFR will be discussed at

the end of Section 4.

In Figure 9, the temporal evolutions of the Si iv line intensity and Doppler velocity

along slit S2 are demonstrated in the left panels. The temporal evolutions of the intensity

and Doppler velocity of H1* and H2* are extracted and plotted in the right panels with

cyan and magenta lines. The evolutions of intensities of H1* and H2* are similar to H1
and H2. The red-shifted VD of H2* increased quickly from ∼10 km s−1 at 10:15:18 UT
and reached the maximum of ∼52 km s−1 at 10:17:09 UT before decreasing gradually to

– 14 –

∼10 km s−1 at 10:20:32 UT. The timescale of chromospheric condensation of H2* was ∼3.5
minutes. The VD of H1* was red-shifted and ﬂuctuated slightly around 4 km s−1 during

most of the lifetime.

As mentioned above, the Si iv line intensities and VD of the CFR have similar trends,

implying a temporal correlation between the two parameters. In Figure 10, the scatter

plots of intensity and VD are drawn in the left panels for H2 and H2*. Note that the

intensities are in log-scale. It is obvious that the two parameters are positively correlated

with correlation coeﬃcients ≥0.8.

3.3. QPPs of the Flare

In Figure 6(b), the time derivative of SXR ﬂux in 1−8 ˚A is plotted with a red

line, which is characterized by several regular peaks in the impulsive phase. Using the

same method as described in Li et al. (2015b), we decompose the SXR derivative into a

slow-varying component plus a rapid-varying component, the later of which is displayed in

Figure 11(a). It is clearly revealed that the SXR derivative ﬂuctuated quasi-periodically.

The Morlet wavelet transform of the fast-varying component is illustrated in Figure 11(b).

The quasi-periodicity, i.e., QPPs during 10:16:20−10:21:10 UT, is conﬁrmed. The periods

are 25−40 s with its maximum power lying at ∼32 s.

In Figure 8 and Figure 9, the violent ﬂuctuations of the Si iv intensities of the CFR

imply the existence of QPPs in UV wavelengths. In order to justify the conjecture, we

decompose the light curves in Figure 8(b) and Figure 9(b) into slow-varying components

and fast-varying components by smoothing. The Morlet wavelet transforms of the

fast-varying components are illustrated in Figure 12. The QPPs in UV wavelengths during

10:16:05−10:19:05 UT are conﬁrmed. In the left panels, the periods range from 25 to 60

– 15 –

s, with the maximum power lying at ∼42 s for H1 and ∼38 s for H2. In the right panels,

the periods range from 25 to 50 s, with the maximum power lying at ∼35 s for H1* and

∼33 s for H2*. It is evident that the periods are very close and slightly longer than the

period in SXR (32 s). The evolutions of VD in Figure 8(d) and Figure 9(d), however, do

not show QPPs. In Figure 6(b), the light curve of the ﬂare in 1400 ˚A is drawn with a blue

line. By and large, the total 1400 ˚A intensity, as a signature of heating at the chromosphere

by nonthermal electrons, has similar evolution to the SXR derivative. Correlation analysis

shows that the two parameters are temporally correlated (c.c.≈0.77) during the impulsive

phase. However, QPP was absent in the 1400 ˚A light curve.

4. Discussion

4.1. What Is the Cause of Chromospheric Condensation?

The observational studies of chromospheric evaporation and condensation have a long

history. Ichimoto & Kurokawa (1984) studied the temporal evolution of the Hα line proﬁles

of 4 ﬂares near the disk center. The timescales of the total evolutions are ∼1 minute. The

authors proposed that the red asymmetry of Hα line results from the downward motion

of the compressed chromospheric region produced by the impulsive heating by energetic

electron beam or thermal conduction. Li et al. (2015a) found positive correlations between

the HXR emissions and upward Doppler shifts of Fe xxi line and downward Doppler shifts

of C i line (log T ≈ 4.0) in two X1.6 ﬂares. In the C4.2 circular-ribbon ﬂare, Zhang et al.

(2016) found that the IFR where explosive chromospheric evaporation occurred was

cospatial with the single HXR source. A quantitative estimation of the energy ﬂux of the

nonthermal electron supports the electron-driven evaporation/condensation.

Like in Li et al. (2015a), we explored the relationship between the downward VD of the

– 16 –

CFR and SXR derivative for the C3.1 ﬂare. The scatter plots of the two parameters are

drawn in the right panels of Figure 10 for H2 and H2*, indicating that they are positively

correlated with correlation coeﬃcients ≥0.7. In Figure 13, the radio dynamic spectra from

KRIM and BLENSW are displayed in the top two panels. The most striking feature is the

type III burst with enhanced emissions and rapid frequency drift during 10:17:00−10:18:00

UT. The dynamic spectra from RAD1 and RAD2 aboard WIND/WAVES are displayed

in the bottom two panels. The frequency of burst drifted rapidly from 13 MHz at 10:18

UT to 1 MHz at 10:20 UT and then drifted slowly to ∼0.2 MHz until ∼10:40 UT. The

radio ﬂux at 42.5 MHz is plotted in Figure 6(b) with a green line. The peaks of the radio

ﬂux were roughly coincident with the peaks of SXR derivative. Considering that the HXR

ﬂux and type III radio burst origin from the nonthermal electrons propagating downward

into the chromosphere along the newly reconnected magnetic ﬁeld lines and upward into

the interplanetary space along the open ﬁeld lines, the coincidence of the peaks during the

impulsive phase of the ﬂare implies the existence of nonthermal electrons accelerated by

magnetic reconnection. Combining the positive correlation between VD of the CFR and

SXR derivative, we conclude that the chromospheric condensation of the C3.1 ﬂare was

most probably driven by nonthermal electrons.

The investigations of chromospheric condensation in theory and numerical simulations

have also made huge progress. Fisher (1986) derived an analytical expression of the

condensation lifetime:

p
where H and g stand for the gravitational scale height and acceleration of gravity in the

τ = π

H/g,

(4)

chromosphere. The typical value of τ is ∼1 minute. However, superposition of continuous

condensations energized at diﬀerent times within an unresolved observational element

naturally result in a longer condensation lifetime (Fisher 1989). In the combined modeling

of acceleration, transport, and hydrodynamic response in solar ﬂares, Rubio da Costa et al.

– 17 –

(2015) found that the condensation timescale can reach 70−90 s. In the 1D radiative

hydrodynamic numerical simulations, Reep et al. (2015) found that the timescales of the

electron-driven chromospheric evaporation are 3.5−4 minutes for diﬀerent cases.

In Table 2, we list the timescales of chromospheric condensation and evaporation in

the previous literatures. It is revealed that the timescales of evaporation upﬂows (2−20

minutes) are generally 2−3 times larger than the timescales of condensation downﬂows

(1−7 minutes). For the C3.1 ﬂare in this study, the condensation timescale is 3−4 minutes,

which is consistent with previous ﬁndings. To our knowledge, the cadence (6 s) of the IRIS

raster observation is the highest ever for the investigation of chromospheric condensation.

Based on the radiative hydrodynamic ﬂare model, Fisher (1989) derived an analytical

expression of the peak downﬂow speed for explosive evaporation:

vpeak ≈ 0.6(Fevap/ρch)1/3,

(5)

where Fevap and ρch represent the energy ﬂux and chromospheric density. For the C3.1 ﬂare,
vpeak = 52 km s−1. Taking 10−11 g cm−3 as the typical value of ρch in the chromosphere,
Fevap is estimated to be 0.65×1010 erg cm−2 s−1, which is close to the threshold energy ﬂux
for explosive evaporation (∼1010 erg cm−2 s−1). The estimated Fevap should be a lower limit

since the slit positions (S1 and S2) are located at the CFR whose maximum intensity is far

less than the IFR and PFRs. According to the correlation between the intensity and VD

of Si iv line in the left panels of Figure 10, the peak downward velocities at the IFR and

PFRs should be larger and the nonthermal electron energy ﬂux should be higher.

4.2. What Is the Cause of QPPs?

QPPs of solar ﬂares have been extensively observed and reported in various wavelengths.

However, the mechanism of QPPs still remains unclear. On one hand, there are diverse

– 18 –

MHD waves (kink mode and sausage mode) in the solar atmosphere, such as the slow wave,

fast wave, and Alfv´en wave. The existence and propagation of waves may modulate the

emissions in certain wavelengths (e.g. Nakariakov et al. 2004; Mariska 2005; Tan et al. 2010;

Su et al. 2012a). On the other hand, the magnetic reconnection rate may be modulated

by the p−mode wave (Chen & Priest 2006), slow-mode wave (Nakariakov & Zimovets

2011), Alfv´en wave (Asai et al. 2001), fast sausage-mode wave (Zaitsev & Stepanov

1982), and fast kink-mode wave (Nakariakov et al. 2006). Therefore, the acceleration and

propagation of electrons in the downward and upward directions would be modulated by

the periodic magnetic reconnections (Aschwanden et al. 1994; Ning et al. 2005). Besides,

the tearing-mode instability and coalescence of magnetic islands occur iteratively, resulting

in intermittent magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration (Kliem et al. 2000; Karlick´y

2004). In a single loop ﬂare on 2005 January 1, Nakariakov et al. (2010) found QPPs of

γ-ray emission with a period of ∼40 s, which are also present in the HXR and microwave

emissions. They proposed that the QPPs are created by periodic magnetic reconnections

accompanying particle acceleration triggered by a global kink oscillation in a nearby coronal

loop. In an M1.8 ﬂare on 2002 October 20, Zimovets & Struminsky (2010) found QPPs

of both thermal and nonthermal HXR emissions with periods of 16 s and 36 s, which are

interpreted in terms of MHD oscillations excited in two interacting systems of ﬂaring loops.

In our study, the QPPs with periods of 32−42 s are observed in UV (Si iv λ1402.77)

and SXR derivative. As described at the beginning of Section 3.1, the length of a loop from

the null point to the solar surface is estimated to be ∼20 Mm. If the QPPs are caused by

the modulation of magnetic reconnection by fast wave propagating along the fan surface, the
phase speed (2L/PQP P ) is estimated to be 950−1250 km s−1, which is close to the typical

value for fast wave in the corona. Hence, the QPPs in the C3.1 ﬂare are most probably

caused by the modulation of magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, and subsequent

precipitation by fast wave propagating along the fan surface loops. The nonthermal

– 19 –

electrons propagating downward heat the chromosphere and generate evaporation as well

as condensation. Therefore, QPPs are generated in both UV and SXR during the impulsive

phase of the ﬂare. In the X1.6 two-ribbon ﬂare on 2014 September 10, QPPs are observed

in multiwavelengths from radio to HXR (Li et al. 2015b). Our results indicate that QPPs

exist not only in the typical two-ribbon ﬂares, but also in circular-ribbon ﬂares. The same

mechanism may at work in both types.

Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the inﬂuence of the rest wavelength on the results. As

mentioned in Section 2.2, the spectral proﬁles of Si iv λ1402.77 line could not been ﬁtted

by a single-Gaussian function or double-Gaussian function. Using the same method as

described in Brosius & Daw (2015), we derived the same rest wavelength of Si iv line,

i.e., 1402.86±0.0145 ˚A. Therefore, our method is reasonable and results are convincing.

The blueshifted Doppler velocities of H1 (see Figure 8(d)) may be a signature of gentle

chromospheric evaporation due to a very low energy ﬂux of electrons. However, the

blueshifts are too small to draw a solid conclusion.

5. Summary

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C3.1 circular-ribbon

ﬂare by various instruments on 2015 October 16. The main results are summarized as

follows:

1. The ﬂare brightened ﬁrst at the southwest part. As time goes on, the area of initial

brightening expanded and became more complex, including several patches or kernels.

Meanwhile, the narrow eastern part of ﬂare appeared, forming the CFR that encircled

the IFR. Apart from the CFR and IFR, there were a pair of short PFRs to the north

of IFR, which were most striking in the IRIS /SJI 1400 ˚A and 2796 ˚A. For the ﬁrst

– 20 –

time, we observe the circular-ribbon ﬂare in the Ca ii H line aboard Hinode/SOT.

The shape of CFR is similar to that observed in AIA 1600 ˚A.

2. Like the C4.2 homologous ﬂare, this ﬂare was associated with positive polarities and

a negative polarity inside in the AR 12434. The IFR and CFR were cospatial with

the negative polarity and positive polarities, implying the existence of a magnetic null

point and dome-like spine-fan topology.

3. High-cadence (6 s) IRIS raster observations show plasma downﬂow in the Si iv line

during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare. The Doppler velocities increased from a

few km s−1 to the peak values of 45−52 km s−1. Afterwards, the speeds decreased

gradually to the initial levels. The timescales of the chromospheric condensation were

3−4 minutes, indicating ongoing magnetic reconnection.

4. The Doppler velocities of the condensation are positively correlated with the logarithm

of the Si iv line intensities and time derivative of the SXR ﬂux in 1−8 ˚A. The radio

dynamic spectra reveal that the ﬂare was accompanied by a type III radio burst.

Combining the correlations and radio burst, we conclude that the chromospheric

condensation was most probably driven by nonthermal electrons. Using the analytical

expression in Fisher (1989) and the peak downﬂow speed, we carried out a diagnostic

of energy ﬂux of the precipitated electrons. A lower limit of the ﬂux is estimated to

be 0.65×1010 erg cm−2 s−1.

5. During the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, the Si iv line intensities and SXR derivative

show QPPs with periods of 32−42 s. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of

QPPs in circular-ribbon ﬂares. The QPPs were most probably caused by intermittent

null-point magnetic reconnections modulated by the fast wave propagating along the

fan surface loops at a phase speed of 950−1250 km s−1. The intermittent acceleration

– 21 –

and precipitations of electrons result in periodic heating observed in the Si iv line and

emissions in SXR.

In the future, additional case studies using state-of-the-art, multiwavelength

observations and MHD numerical simulations are required to ﬁgure out the causes of

chromospheric condensation and QPPs in circular-ribbon ﬂares.

(a) and (b), the white curves represent the spacetime average spectra between the positions

(-270′′ and -230′′) marked by the two yellow lines during 10:15:21−10:15:43 UT. The rest

wavelength (λ0) of Si iv λ1402.77 is calculated to be 1402.86±0.0145 ˚A. In panels (c)-(h),

the green curves are the spectra at H1 and H1* in three raster scans. The blue curves are

the spectra at H2 and H2* in three raster scans.

Fig. 10.— Scatter plots of Si iv Doppler velocity and intensity (left panels) and SXR ﬂux

deriviative (right panels) for H2 (top panels) and H2* (bottom panels). Note the intensities

are in log-scale. The correlation coeﬃcients are also displayed in each panel.

Fig. 11.— (a) Fast-varying component of the time derivative of SXR ﬂux in Figure 6(b).

(b) Morlet wavelet transform of the component. The red color represents the highest power.

The white, solid contour encloses regions of ≥95% conﬁdence level for a white noise process

(Torrence & Compo 1998). The cross-hatched regions indicate the “cone of inﬂuence”, where

edge eﬀects become important (Wang et al. 2009).

Fig. 12.— Morlet wavelet transforms of the fast-varying components of the Si iv intensities

of H1 (a), H1* (b), H2 (c), and H2* (d). The annotations have the same meanings as in

Figure 11(b).
