We propose a physically motivated decomposition of DFT 3-body nonadditive interac-

tion energies into the exchange and density-deformation (polarization) components. The

exchange component represents the eﬀect of the Pauli exclusion in the wave function of

the trimer and is found to be challenging for density functional approximations (DFAs).

The remaining density-deformation nonadditivity is less dependent upon the DFAs.

Numerical demonstration is carried out for rare gas atom trimers, Ar2-HX (X = F, Cl)

complexes, and small hydrogen-bonded and van der Waals molecular systems. None

of the tested semilocal, hybrid, and range-separated DFAs properly accounts for the

nonadditive exchange in dispersion-bonded trimers. By contrast, for hydrogen-bonded

systems range-separated hybrids achieve a qualitative agreement to within 20% of the

reference exchange energy. A reliable performance for all systems is obtained only when

the monomers interact through the Hartree-Fock potential in the dispersion-free Pauli

Blockade scheme. Additionally, we identify the nonadditive second-order exchange-

dispersion energy as an important but overlooked contribution in force-ﬁeld-like disper-

sion corrections. Our results suggest that range-separated functionals do not include

this component although semilocal and global hybrid DFAs appear to imitate it in the

short range.

INTRODUCTION

The decomposition of the interaction energy into many-body contributions provides insights

into the eﬀects beyond pairwise contacts. Although 3- and higher-body components are signif-

icantly weaker than 2-body ones, the number of the former increases rapidly with the cluster

size.1 They cannot be neglected when predicting the structure and properties of clusters of

water,2–8 clathrate hydrates,9,10 molecular crystals11 and condensed-phase systems.1,12 Finally,

the quantitative description of nonadditive eﬀects is indispensable when resolving the high-

resolution spectra of molecular trimers and larger aggregates.13–19

For more than a decade the applications of DFT to noncovalent interactions have focused

on the development of dispersion-correction schemes accounting for the dispersion eﬀects miss-

ing from hybrid and semilocal density functional approximations (DFAs).20 As a result, the

dispersion-inclusive DFT methods achieved statistical errors within a few tenths of a kcal/mol

with respect to ab initio benchmark databases for noncovalent dimers.21–24 Nevertheless, the

studies of larger aggregates drew attention to the importance of many-body errors in DFT and

to their origin.4–6,9,25,26

Recent work lists the following sources of DFA errors in binding energies:7 a) errors in the

intersystem exchange interaction, b) the delocalization error, and c) the monomer relaxation

errors. The error in the exchange interaction stems from the inability of the semilocal functional

to describe the electron exchange in the tails of overlapping densities, i.e. regions of signiﬁcant

change of reduced density gradients s = |∇ρ|/ρ4/3 upon formation of a noncovalent bond.6,27,28

In the language of perturbation theory this translates into the ﬂawed treatment of the ex-

change terms arising from the Pauli exclusion principle. The delocalization error, also known

as many-electron self-interaction error, refers to the fact that semilocal DFAs yield electron

densities which are too delocalized.23,29 This is pronounced in systems with strong induction

and electrostatic interactions, although one should not forget that all interaction energy com-

ponents are aﬀected.30 Finally, the monomer relaxation error, which contributes to the binding

energies of the cluster, concerns the ability of the functional to account for the energetics of

bond stretching due to the formation of the complex. The inclusion of pair-wise dispersion

corrections cancels out some of these errors.7,31

Several studies have recognized the ﬂaws in exchange functionals as a source of errors in 3-

and higher-body terms.6,25,32 The most comprehensive test of DFAs encompasses a comparison

of DFT and coupled-cluster total 3-body energies on the 3B-69 database of 23 molecular trimers

in 69 conﬁgurations.32 A common suggestion in the aforementioned works is that the errors

arising from the incorrect many-body exchange may be more important than the missing many-

2

body dispersion interactions. Clearly, this issue has to be addressed in order to improve the

reliability of DFT predictions for large aggregates.

The conclusions in the existing literature (with only some exceptions – see Ref. 25) are based

on inference from the supermolecular computations of many-body terms which bundle together

eﬀects of a diﬀerent physical origin and geometry-dependence. Unlike in the wave function

methods, such as Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, where the many-body interaction energy

components residing in each order are known,18 such insights are missing in the case of DFAs.

The performance of DFT for 3-body interactions can be understood given a physically mean-

ingful decomposition of the interaction energy. To this end, we deﬁne the decomposition of the

total 3-body interaction energy into the exchange and polarization components. Our aim is

to reveal which nonadditive contributions to 3-body interaction energy are captured by diﬀer-

ent DFAs and how accurate this description is in DFT. This will be done by comparing the

DFT exchange and polarization components with rigorously deﬁned many-body terms from the

perturbation expansion of the interaction energy.

The assessment of the DFT’s ability to account for the exchange nonadditivity involves the

following strategy. To extract the exchange part from a supermolecular DFT 3-body term

we evaluate the interaction energy of the Löwdin-orthogonalized monomers which is the DFT

equivalent of the Heitler-London exchange nonadditivity.33 Next, we substitute the Hartree-

Fock formula for the intermolecular part of the exchange potential to investigate how switching

from the DFT to HF description changes the exchange nonadditivity. This is carried out with

the aid of the dispersion-free Pauli Blockade (PBdf),34 the method which we generalized here

to the many-body case. Finally, nonadditive exchange energies extracted from both super-

molecular DFT and PBdf are compared with the Heitler-London term, for which we provide

benchmark data. This strategy serves as the ﬁrst step toward revealing what 3-body contribu-

tions are captured in the supermolecular DFT interaction energies and how trustworthy their

representation in speciﬁc DFT approximations is.

In the numerical secion we focus our attention on a range of challenging systems: from rare-

gas trimers, to Ar2-HX (X = F, Cl), to selected hydrogen and dispersion-bonded molecular

trimers. Based on the presented energy decomposition scheme and 3-body symmetry-adapted

perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis we draw conclusions on the performance of approximate

DFT.

II. THEORY

A. Energy decomposition

The total 3-body nonadditive interaction energy is deﬁned in terms of trimer, dimer and

monomer total energies as:

Eint = EABC − EAB − EBC − EAC + EA + EB + EC.

(1)

Since our focus is solely on nonadditive interactions in trimers, we omit the [3, 3] label usually

applied in the literature. To analyze DFAs we decompose Eint into the nonadditive exchange

and deformation contributions

Eint = Enadd-ex + Edef.

(2)

The nonadditive exchange captures the energetic eﬀect of applying the Pauli exclusion in

the Kohn-Sham wave function upon formation of the trimer out of noninteracting monomers.

The computation of Enadd-ex for an arbitrary DFA consists of a noniterative trimer and dimers
energy evaluation from the Löwdin-orthogonalized35 orbitals of the isolated monomers.33 Eint

is computed directly from Eq. (1). The deformation energy corresponds to the energy lowering

upon mutual self-consistent polarization of the monomers restrained by the Pauli exclusion

principle and is computed as

Edef = Eint − Enadd−ex.

(3)

An analogous energy decomposition for dimers was ﬁrst proposed by Cybulski and Sev-

ersen.33,36 Enadd−ex is the DFT version of the nonadditive Heitler-London interaction energy, a
well-established concept in the theory of intermolecular interactions:33,36,37

energy of the XY dimer.

1. Nonadditive exchange term

The energy partitioning introduced in Eq. (2) is physically appealing due to the fact that

benchmark values for the Enadd−ex term can be calculated directly from symmetry-adapted
perturbation theory (SAPT). The reference for Enadd−ex, denoted EHL(KS)

, is computed as the

int

Heitler-London interaction energy with Kohn-Sham determinants.

In order to use the existing 2-body and 3-body codes for SAPT based on Kohn-Sham de-

scription of monomers (DFT-SAPT) we compute this term as

and ∆M denotes the Murrell delta term,38 also referred to as the zeroth-order exchange energy.

(See the Supplementary Information (SI) for explicit formulas for the computation of ∆M.)

The reference EHL(KS)

int

value depends only weakly on the underlying DFA, provided that

an asymptotic correction39 or a tuned range-separated functional40,41 is applied (see Table S1
in SI for the sensitivity test of EHL(KS)

). The correct asymptotic behavior of the exchange-

int

correlation potential yields reliable monomer densities’, a well-known prerequisite for DFT-

SAPT calculations.42

Based on the DFT-SAPT performance for the two-body ﬁrst-order exchange energy,43 we

expect that the 3-body E(1)
exch,SAPT term is most accurately reproduced when monomers are
described with asymptotically-corrected hybrid functionals. Consequently, we will use EHL(KS)

int

based on PBE044,45 functional with the GRAC46 asymptotic correction as a reference for the

nonadditive exchange.

Depending on the quality of the exchange-correlation functional, Enadd−ex should approach

the reference EHL(KS)

int

value. While both Enadd−ex and EHL(KS)

int

are computed with approximate

DFT methods, the latter replaces the exchange-correlation functional in the intermonomer

region with the Heitler-London exchange. The description of the intramonomer correlation

enters in both quantities through the use of Kohn-Sham orbitals.47

It should be stressed that the major part of the exact nonadditive exchange energy is cap-

tured already at the Hartree-Fock level of theory.47 In particular, the Enadd−ex contribution

which is included in the supermolecular 3-body Hartree-Fock interaction energy is equal to the

EHL
int

formula calculated with Hartree-Fock determinants. Obviously, Hartree-Fock misses the

intramonomer correlation contribution to Enadd−ex which in the Møller-Plesset perturbation

theory enters at the MP2 and higher levels.18

2. Deformation term

Several comments regarding the Edef component should be made. At the Hartree-Fock level

of theory the deformation contribution collects second- and higher-order induction energy com-

5

ponents together with their exchange counterparts while the lowest-order intramonomer con-

tributions to those terms enter at the MP2 level.18 We expect that the nonadditive many-body

induction terms, including the intramonomer correlation contributions, should be recovered

quantitatively by the exisiting DFAs and their description should systematically improve upon

the minimization of the delocalization error.7,32 On the other hand, the third-order induction-

dispersion energy (along with its exchange counterpart) and second-order exchange-dispersion

energy – both included at the MP2 level – are most problably not accounted for due to the

semilocal nature of DFAs. We will investigate this problem in more detail in Section III.B.

A well-known component of the many-body nonadditive interaction energy is the third-order

dispersion energy, E(3)

disp, which in the Møller-Plesset theory ﬁrst appears at the MP3 level. Much
attention has been devoted to the proper inclusion of this term in DFT.20,48 We address the
importance of E(3)

disp relative to the remaining second- and third-order terms in Sections III.B

and III.C.

B. Dispersion-free Pauli Blockade

To expose the DFA errors in the description of intermonomer regions, we introduce a scheme

in which the Kohn-Sham exchange in the intermonomer region is replaced by the exact Hartree-

Fock expression (Figure 1). This approach eliminates the dispersion component of the inter-

action energy and is referred to as dispersion-free Pauli Blockade.34 In this section we brieﬂy

introduce the idea behind many-body PBdf and comment on the contents of the nonadditive

3-body PBdf interaction energy.

In the PBdf formalism the Kohn-Sham equation for the orbitals of monomer µ in a system

composed of L weakly interacting monomers is

L

Xν6=µ



fµ(r) +



vν(r) + jν(r) − kν(r)

(cid:18)



(cid:19)



µ(r) = ǫi
ϕi

µϕi

µ(r),

(7)

where fµ(r) is the Kohn-Sham operator of the µ monomer, vν(r) describes nuclei-electron

attraction, jν(r) is the Coulomb electron-electron repulsion, and kν(r) is an exact HF-like

exchange operator. Note that fµ(r) corresponds to the unaltered Kohn-Sham operator for a

given DFT approximation.

Eq. (7) is solved in an iterative fashion keeping the monomer orbitals orthogonal at all times.

This may be achieved either with the use of the penalty function,49 or the exponential ansatz

of orbital rotation.50 The latter scheme is more eﬃcient and numerically stable, and therefore

has been used in the current implementation of the PBdf method. The iterative process stars

from the Löwdin-orthogonalized35 orbitals of the isolated monomers.

The PBdf energy formula, Eq. (8), is used to compute the dispersion-free total nonadditive

3-body interaction energy, Edfree

, according to Eq. (1), which requires converging the orbitals

in Pauli Blockade equations for the trimer and for the dimers. The energy partitioning of

Eq. (2) yields dispersion-free counterparts of nonadditive exchange and deformation energy

contributions:

(10)

where the Edfree

nadd−ex term is obtained in the same manner as Enadd−ex for the full DFA functional,

i.e. employing orbitals of the isolated monomers which are Löwdin-orthogonalized but otherwise

kept unperturbed. As will be shown, because of the enforcement of the exact exchange Edfree

nadd−ex

varies much less than Enadd−ex among diﬀerent DFAs.

7

While the prescription for the PBdf energy is based on a simple model, it provides a useful

diagnostic to gain insight into the source of qualitative errors in DFT exchange. A detailed

derivation of the Pauli Blockade and dispersion-free Pauli Blockade schemes may be found in

SI and in Refs. 34 and 49.

C. Computational details

The d5z basis of Ref. 51 was chosen for He. The argon trimer, as well as Ar2-HX (X = F, Cl)

systems were studied with the aug-cc-pVQZ basis of Dunning.52 The molecular trimers from

the 3B-69 basis32 and Ref.7 were studied with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis. All 3-body energies were

counterpoise-corrected.53 The MVS54 and SCAN55 calculations were done on a large grid of

300 radial and 1202 angular points of the Lebedev grid. The IP-optimized values of the range-

separation parameter ω for the ωPBE56 functional (also known as LRC-ωPBE), ω = 0.55 for

Ar and ω = 1.0247 for He, were taken from Ref. 57. For molecular trimers studied in Sec. III.C

ωPBE was used with ω = 0.5, as recommended in Ref. 7. The LC-PBETPSS functional58

represents the class of meta-GGA range-separated hybrids. All LC-PBETPSS calculations

functional were performed with the default ω = 0.35 value. The DFT-SAPT calculations

employed the PBE0 functional44,45 with the GRAC46 asymptotic correction. The ﬁrst-order

nonadditive exchange and second-order nonadditive exchange-dispersion SAPT contributions

were obtained without overlap expansion, i.e., they are correct to all orders of the intermonomer

overlap.59–63 Additionally, for molecular trimers analyzed in Sec. III.C we calculated second-
order exchange-dispersion energies at the uncoupled Hartree-Fock level (E(2;0)
exch−disp(S2 + S3))
with the SAPT2012 code.47,64–66 All 3-body PBdf and DFT-SAPT calculations were done in
the developer’s version of Molpro.67 Calculation with the ωB97XD368 functional were done
in the Orca program.69

III. RESULTS

A. Rare-gas atom trimers

The failure of supermolecular DFT in predicting 3-body interactions in rare gas trimers was

studied in the past.6,70 The wrong description of regions with high reduced density gradients

translates into the ﬂawed nonadditive exchange interaction energies in the cluster.6,7,25 This

assessment of the DFT performance is evidenced in Table I, where the total 3-body interaction

energies seriously deviate from both Hartree-Fock and coupled-cluster values. Because the

tested functionals do not include any dispersion correction it is reasonable to expect the DFT

8

energies to be close to the Hartree-Fock ones.

For the comparison of DFAs we chose two functionals of the GGA rung which feature diﬀerent

asymptotic behavior of the exchange enhancement factor Fx(s): BLYP71 and PBE72, as well
as their hybrid counterparts: B3LYP73 and PBE0.

In addition, the optimally-tuned ωPBE

functional represents the class of range-separated functionals.

The functionals characterized by rapid increase of Fx(s) (BLYP and its hybrids) predict

much too attractive nonadditive exchange energy while the slow increase of Fx(s) in PBE-

based functionals results in much too repulsive Enadd−ex (Table I). It is worthwhile to note that

the similar behavior of the 3-body exchange terms in the B88- and PBE-based functionals was

recognized before in the analysis of water hexamers.25

Two factors determine the accuracy of the DFT nonadditive exchange energy: the qual-

ity of density in the region of large reduced density gradient and the approximations in the

exchange-correlation energy formula.6,7 The progression of results from semilocal PBE, to a

global hybrid PBE0, to range-separated ωPBE functional shows that including a fraction

of Hartree-Fock exchange is mandatory and the long range corrected form of the functional

brings the biggest improvement (Table I). For the PBE-based functionals the long range cor-

rected form of the functional is imperative to account even for the correct sign of Enadd−ex.

Next, the eﬀect of the HOMO orbital, which determines the tail of the density, is also impor-

tant. For example, for He3 the ωPBE functional with the default ω parameter corresponds to

Enadd−ex = −3.9 µHartree, whereas the variant of this functional which enforces Koopmans’

9

theorem corresponds to Enadd−ex = −2.3 µHartree. Note that the sign of Enadd−ex is correct

in B88-based functionals but the inclusion of the exact exchange results in further substantial

improvement.

The Heitler-London exchange energy can be reproduced accurately provided that the inter-

action between the monomers is described fully at the Hartree-Fock level. This can be achieved

by means of PBdf, where the monomers interact with the exact Hartree-Fock potentials but

the intramonomer contributions to the interaction energy are described at the DFT level. Ap-

plying the ωPBE functional in the PBdf framework reduces the error in the Heitler-London

energy by an order of magnitude with respect to ωPBE for He3 and Ar3 (Table II). Some-

what surprisingly, the remaining discrepancy between PBdf and ωPBE suggests that the full

Hartree-Fock exchange at long range in the range-separated hybrid is not suﬃcient to capture

the eﬀect of the nonadditive exchange. The reference values which PBdf should approach,

provided that the underlying functional accurately describes intramonomer correlation, are the

3-body interaction energies at the MP2 level minus the second-order exchange-dispersion term.

We reiterate that while MP2 does not include the three-body dispersion energy, it contains

the uncoupled second-order exchange-dispersion.18,74 The latter was shown to be important in

rare-gases.47,75–77 (The induction correlation eﬀects are also present but for rare gas trimers are

negligible.)

B. Ar2-HX (X=F,Cl)

The paradigm trimers for studies of nonadditive forces, Ar2-HF and Ar2-HCl, were the ﬁrst

systems for which it was possible to extract the 3-body potential based on the microwave78,79

and far-infrared80,81 spectroscopic data, as done in the works of Hutson et al.13 and Cooper and

Hutson.14 The nature of nonadditive interactions in Ar2-HX was later thoroughly studied in

a series of papers combining supermolecular MPn calculations and direct calculations of non-

additive energy components based on perturbation theory.77,82–85 3-body interactions manifest

themselves most clearly in the regions of in- and out-of plane rotations of HF and HCl.

As shown in Refs. 82 and 83, the dominant contribution to the anisotropy in Ar2-HX comes

from the exchange nonadditivity, yet the induction and dispersion components cannot be ne-

glected. The leading contribution to the third-order induction comes from the moments induced

on two argon atoms by the ﬁeld of HX. The exchange and induction nonadditivities are more

pronounced in Ar2-HF as the distance between HF and the center of mass of Ar2 is considerably

smaller than in Ar2-HCl, and the HF dipole is larger than that of HCl.

In the present work we focus only on the in-plane rotations of HX, where Θ is varied from 0◦

(the global minimum) to 180◦ (Figure 2). Θ = 0◦ corresponds to H pointing toward the center

of the triangle. The bond lengths for Ar2HCl are:82,83 rHCl = 1.275 Å, rAr−Ar = 3.861 Å and

R = 3.4736 Å. The values for Ar2HF are: rHF = 0.917 Å, rAr−Ar = 3.826 Å and R = 2.9798 Å.

The performance of DFT methods for the total 3-body interaction energies of Ar2-HX is

qualitatively the same as in the case of noble gas trimers. The BLYP and B3LYP functionals are

in better agreement with both Hartree-Fock and MP2 results than the PBE-based functionals

(Figure 3, the results for PBE and PBE0 are given in Figure S1, SI). The behavior of the PBE-

based approximations improves upon introducing range separation of the exchange functional.

Finally, PBdf and Hartree-Fock, which do not account for the second-order exchange dispersion

and induction-dispersion eﬀects, closely follow each other for Ar2-HX.

results

based on DFT-SAPT (Figure 4). As in noble gas trimers, the errors are ameliorated in ωPBE.

The PBE-based range-separated functional on the meta-GGA rung, LC-PBETPSS, performs

similarly to ωPBE, which conﬁrms that our conclusion on the role of range separated-exchange

is general. In addition, the B88-based functionals stay in better agreement with the reference

Heitler-London energy than the PBE-based approximations.

It is tempting to check if going beyond PBE- and B88-type enhancement factors leads to

any improvement in the description of the nonadditive exchange. To this end, we examined

two recently developed meta-GGA functionals: MVS54 and SCAN.55 The enhancement factors

built into these formulas have radically diﬀerent asymptotic behavior from those in PBE and

B88.54 The MVS/SCAN enhancement factor satisﬁes

lim
s→∞

Fx(s, α) ∝ s−(1/2),

(11)

where α is a dimensionless variable which depends on the kinetic energy density.54 In contrast,

the BLYP enhancement factor is approximately linear for large s, whereas PBE approaches a

constant.

This new Fx(s), however, does not lead to an improvement for 3-body energies in Ar2-
HX. For Θ ∈ (0◦, 60◦) both MVS and SCAN predict wrong angular dependence of the total

interaction energies (Figure 5). The error can be attributed to the behavior of the nonadditive

exchange part (for Ar2-HCl results see SI).

The spread of deformation energies computed with diﬀerent DFT methods is much smaller

than in the case of the exchange nonadditivity (Figure 4). Long range correction no longer

moves the results towards Hartree-Fock ones. The curves corresponding to ωPBE and LC-

PBETPSS deviate from both Hartree-Fock and global hybrids in the range of Θ = 0◦ to 60◦.

To understand whether the diﬀerence between range-separated DFT and Hartree-Fock is

∆E(2) is the correlation contribution to MP2 interaction energy which contains intramonomer

correlation contributions to nonadditive exchange and induction terms, second-order exchange-

dispersion, and third-order induction-dispersion and exchange-induction-dispersion terms.18,74

As shown before77,85 the induction-dispersion terms are partly canceled by their exchange coun-

terparts.

Importantly, the correlation contribution to the nonadditive exchange is small in Ar2-HX.

This can be inferred from Figure 4 where the diﬀerence between the Heitler-London exchange

(cid:17)

is on the order of 1 µHartree (see also Figure S3 in SI). Among the physical contributions
to Ecorr,DFT
def

, we expect that the DFT approximations reliably account for the intramonomer

correlation contributions to the assorted induction terms.

The range-separated functionals qualitatively agree with ∆

E(2) while semilocal functionals

and global hybrids are close to ∆E(2) (Figure 6). This indicates that the former excludes the

e

14

 
 
 
 
second-order exchange-dispersion term, while the latter includes it. The E(2)

exch−disp contribution,

which is the exchange counterpart of (the additive) second-order dispersion, may appear in

semilocal functionals only as an artifact, similar to the ﬁctitious exchange binding of noble gas

dimers. Note that the addition of Hartree-Fock exchange in global hybrids partially removes

the spurious angular dependence observed for semilocal exchange at Θ < 60◦.

It should be stressed that although the second-order exchange-dispersion is a sizeable

eﬀect77,85 (see Table S5), it should not contribute to the damping of the dispersion nonad-

ditivity, the third-order Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) term. This role should be reserved for

the exchange counterpart of the third-order ATM dispersion (e.g., Refs. 47, 86, and 87). If
E(2)

exch−disp proves necessary in the context of DFT, it should be employed in a controllable
manner. Therefore, range-separated functionals provide an appropriate starting point for the

development of new dispersion-corrected approaches.

C. H-bonds and dispersion in molecular trimers

We apply our scheme for energy decomposition on a subset of the 3B-69 data set of Řezáč et

al.32 (water, formaldehyde, methanol-ethyne, and acetonitrile trimers), three dispersion-bonded

(CO, CH4, N2) and two H-bonded (HF, NH3) trimers studied in Ref. 7. Only a subset of 3B-69

data set is included due to our computational limits. Our set includes seventeen conﬁgurations

in total, see SI for details.

Diﬀerent description of the exchange nonadditivity is the major source of variance among

DFT approximations (see Tables III and V, Tables S7 and S8 in SI). The deformation energy,

on the other hand, is much more consistent even between functionals based on diﬀerent models

of the enhancement factor, e.g., PBE and BLYP yield almost identical Edef for seventeen tested

trimers.

Remarkably, in contrast to noble gas trimers and Ar2-HX discussed above, in H-bonded

systems the exchange nonadditivity is well reproduced by range-separated hybrids. For the

water trimer in cyclic conﬁguration ωPBE gives Enadd−ex = −0.267 kcal/mol, which is in
reasonable agreement with the reference EHL(KS)

= −0.302 kcal/mol (Table III). Both semilocal

int

and global hybrid approximations predict exchange nonadditivities less accurately than range-

separated hybrids. The MVS functional yields better Enadd−ex than any of the other tested

semilocal methods. Moreover, out of seven systems of predominantly H-bonded character, in

four cases (HF, NH3, methanol-ethyne 3a and 3c) MVS is more accurate than the global hybrids
and approaches the accuracy of ωPBE (Tables S7 and S8 in SI).

The remaining error of ωPBE stems mainly from the lack of the exchange-dispersion and dis-

persion contributions as well as inaccurate deformation due to the residual delocalization error.
For example, for the water trimer adding the coupled Kohn-Sham E(2)

exch−disp = 0.196 kcal/mol
moves ωPBE close to the MP2 result (Table III). Note that exchange-dispersion and other

correlated contributions at the MP2 level largely cancel each other in this system, as indicated

by the excellent agreement of Hartree-Fock and MP2.

To test how the addition of the exchange-dispersion term aﬀects DFT performance, we added

this contribution (at the uncoupled SAPT Hartree-Fock level) to a set of pure, global hybrid

and range-separated functionals (Table S9 in SI). As expected from our discussion of Ar2-HX,
range-separated functionals beneﬁt the most from the inclusion of E(2)

exch−disp; the average errors
of ωPBE and ωB97XD3 on the set of seventeen trimers are reduced by one-third. In contrast,

for PBE, PBE0 and BHLYP the average errors become larger. This ﬁnding shows that the

three-body DFT dispersion correction should depend on the type of the base functional.

As seen in Table III due to the delocalization error, pure GGA functionals yield inaccurate

deformation in H-bonded clusters. The error diminishes upon admixture of a large portion of

exact-exchange (recommended 50%7,32) or application of long range Hartree-Fock exchange in

range-separated hybrids. Accordingly, ωPBE and BHLYP yield similar deformation energies

for water trimer: Edef = −2.427 kcal/mol and -2.392 kcal/mol, respectively.

The good performance of PBE and PBE0 for H-bonded clusters relies on the cancellation of

errors between the nonadditive exchange and deformation components (Table III). This is in

accordance with the observation of Ref. 7. One should note, however, that the error cancellation

in supermolecular calculations with PBE-based semilocal and global hybrid approximations

does not work equally well for every conﬁguration: both PBE and PBE0 typically overestimate

the repulsive 3-body energy contributions.32 On the whole test set dispersion-corrected PBE

stands out with its large average error of MAE = 0.093 kcal/mol which is only slightly improved

by the introduction of the long range Hartree-Fock exchange in ωPBE (Table IV).

The B88-based semilocal and global hybrid approximations improve the nonadditive ex-

change with respect to the PBE-based methods. Still, without the long-range Hartree-Fock

exchange it is impossible to realistically describe Enadd−ex. BHLYP supplied with a dispersion

correction gives the most accurate total 3-body interaction energies on the whole set of seven-

teen trimers (Table IV). It was also identiﬁed as the best-performing functional in the paper of

Řezáč et al.32 with the root-mean-square error of 0.045 kcal/mol compared to 0.059 kcal/mol

for MP2. However, our energy decomposition has shown that BHLYP relies on error cancella-

tion between the inaccurate exchange nonadditivity and other contributions. For example, if
we substituted EHL(KS)

for the BHLYP exchange nonadditivity of the water trimer (Table III),

int

the total 3-body interaction energy would be the same as that of ωPBE.

The 3-body eﬀects in dispersion-bound trimers (N2, CO, and CH4) are beyond the reach
of DFT approximations even at the qualitative level. None of the DFT functionals correctly

accounts for 3-body nonadditive exchange, similarly to noble gas trimers (Table V). In contrast,

the dispersion-free PBdf approach gives good description of exchange interactions for both

dispersion- and H-bonded clusters. A plausible explanation for the distinction between the

DFT treatment of hydrogen- and dispersion-bonded systems is that in the case of the latter

the energetic contributions to the interaction energy come from regions of relatively small

densities.88

IV. CONCLUSIONS

This work has examined the components of nonadditive interactions obtained in the super-

molecular DFT calculations. We proposed a physically meaningful decomposition of the total

3-body nonadditive DFT interaction energy into the exchange interaction term, which captures

the eﬀect of the Pauli exclusion in the wave function of the trimer, and the deformation en-

ergy, which originates from the mutual polarization of the monomers. The scheme, known as

Pauli Blockade, appears to be an essential tool for understanding the performance and future

improvements of DFT models for noncovalent many-body systems.

The major source of variance among DFT methods is the nonadditive exchange term. The

behavior of this contribution can be discussed for two limiting cases: dispersion and hydrogen-

bonded clusters. For the former no DFT approximation reproduces nonadditive exchange even

at a qualitative level, as shown e.g., for rare gas trimers, Ar2-HX and methane trimer. For H-

bonded systems range-separated functionals are the only type of DFT approximations capable

of describing the nonadditive exchange (to within 20% of the reference value). For the paradigm

Ar2-HX (X=F,Cl) systems, range-separated hybrids yield correct anisotropy of Enadd−ex, but

the interaction curves are signiﬁcantly shifted from the reference values. This pertains to both

GGA and meta-GGA range-separated hybrids, as nonempirical functionals belonging to both

rungs, i.e. ωPBE and LC-PBETPSS, respectively, are tested. The MVS and SCAN functionals

18

employing the latest ideas in the enhancement factor design fail in these trimers.

The DFT errors in the deformation energy are smaller than those of the nonadditive ex-

change, and the diﬀerences between functionals are less pronounced. The correlation eﬀects on

induction terms could be indirectly probed in speciﬁc instances such as Ar2-HX. We showed

that range-separated functionals can recover these eﬀects semiquantitatively. Other DFA types

do not permit a more detailed interpretation because their deformation eﬀects are obscured by

artifacts of the exchange functionals.

The second order exchange-dispersion nonadditivity was shown to be very important in

the wide range of systems.47 This nonadditivity represents the exchange counterpart of the

additive second-order dispersion term and is completely ignored in the existing Axilrod-Teller-

Muto force-ﬁeld-like dispersion corrections, due to a completely diﬀerent functional dependence.

In the majority of studied situations, the second-order exchange-dispersion either exceeds or

nearly equals the third-order ATM nonadditivity. For example, in the cyclic water trimer
(1c) the coupled Kohn-Sham E(2)

exch−disp equals 0.196 kcal/mol whereas an approximate damped

ATM term reported in Ref. 32 amounts to 0.028 kcal/mol. Our results for Ar2-HX suggest
that range-separated hybrids do not account for E(2)

exch−disp, while semilocal and global hybrid

functionals may imitate this contribution in the short range. Consequently, on a larger set of
molecules, supplementing the existing dispersion corrections with E(2)

exch−disp term considerably
improves the error statistics for range-separated functionals, but not for pure and global hybrid

approximations.

The dispersion-free Pauli Blockade scheme, in which the mutual polarization of the monomers

occurs via HF operators, fully corrects the description of the nonadditive exchange energy for

every functional and every system, in particular, for both hydrogen- and dispersion-bonded

trimers. By comparison with DFT-SAPT we have shown that PBdf can be used as reference

for the assessment of nonadditive exchange. It should be noted that in PBdf the nonadditive

exchange-dispersion term is not accounted for.

The former can be ameliorated in the particular case of hydrogen-bonded systems by the use

of exact exchange at long range. To conclude, in designing DFT approximations for description

of nonadditive 3-body interactions in weakly bound systems, the major challenges are related

to a reliable modeling of the nonadditivities of the ﬁrst-order as well as the exchange-dispersion

eﬀects. The latter presents a challenge for all types of systems and warrants going beyond the

expressions currently used for three-body dispersion corrections.
