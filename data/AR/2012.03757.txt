ABSTRACT

Interest in stealth coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is increasing due to their relatively high occurrence
rate and space weather impact. However, typical CME signatures such as extreme-ultraviolet dimmings
and post-eruptive arcades are hard to identify and require extensive image processing techniques.
These weak observational signatures mean that little is currently understood about the physics of
these events. We present an extensive study of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in which the stealth
CME of 3 March 2011 occurred. Three distinct episodes of ﬂare ribbon formation are observed in the
stealth CME source active region (AR). Two occurred prior to the eruption and suggest the occurrence
of magnetic reconnection that builds the structure which will become eruptive. The third occurs in
a time close to the eruption of a cavity that is observed in STEREO-B 171˚A data; this subsequently
becomes part of the propagating CME observed in coronagraph data. We use both local (Cartesian)
and global (spherical) models of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, which are complemented and veriﬁed by
the observational analysis. We ﬁnd evidence of a coronal null point, with ﬁeld lines computed from its
neighbourhood connecting the stealth CME source region to two ARs in the northern hemisphere. We
conclude that reconnection at the null point aids the eruption of the stealth CME by removing ﬁeld
that acted to stabilise the pre-eruptive structure. This stealth CME, despite its weak signatures, has
the main characteristics of other CMEs, and its eruption is driven by similar mechanisms.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions of
solar plasma and magnetic ﬁeld, expelled into the helio-
sphere at speeds ranging from a few tens to a few thou-
sands of km s−1 (see review by Webb and Howard 2012).
Stealth CMEs form a subset of all eruptive events and
they are characterised by absent or faint signatures of
eruption in the corona, with no obvious ﬂaring, ﬁlament
eruption, or strong EUV dimmings apparent. Following
the ﬁrst report of a stealth CME (Robbrecht et al. 2009),
studies have shown common trends such as slow prop-
agation speeds typically less than 500 km s−1 (D’Huys
et al. 2014), a higher relative proportion of stealth CMEs
at solar minimum (∼30% of CMEs, Ma et al. 2010) and
an origin in the mid-corona from around 1.2 to 3.0 R(cid:12)
from Sun centre (Howard and Harrison 2013). The low
speed and acceleration of mid-coronal stealth CMEs are

then likely due to the low magnetic ﬁeld strength and
free magnetic energy present at those altitudes. In more
image processing techniques have been
recent works,
able to enhance EUV and coronagraph data to reveal the
fainter on-disc signatures associated with stealth CMEs
(Alzate and Morgan 2017; O’Kane et al. 2019). These
ﬁndings indicate that stealth CMEs often produce the
same characteristic signatures as non-stealth CMEs, al-
beit weaker, meaning that the formation of the eruptive
structure and the physical processes involved in stealth
CMEs can be investigated from both observational and
modelling perspectives.

CME eruption processes involve an energy storage
phase, which may be the product of ﬂux emergence
and/or photospheric ﬂows. Following this, an energy
release phase sets in when ideal or non-ideal (resistive)
processes lead to the rapid expulsion of the structure and

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

O’Kane et al.

the release of energy of the order 1022-1025J. The quasi-
static evolution during the energy build-up phase may
also be a period in which a magnetic ﬂux rope is built
via reconnection in the photosphere or chromosphere
(Green et al. 2011) or in the mid-corona (Patsourakos
et al. 2013; James et al. 2017). The speciﬁc details of the
pre-eruptive magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration will then inﬂu-
ence which mechanisms may act as the driver to produce
the CME, e.g., the role of ﬂare-related reconnection or
an ideal magnetohydrodynamic instability (for a review
of CME processes see Green et al. 2018).

Stealth CMEs are expected to follow this energy stor-
age and release sequence but the weak or absent signa-
tures of ﬂaring are an indication of only weak energy re-
lease associated with magnetic reconnection during the
eruption itself. Kinematic studies suggest that the rise
of a stealth CME follows an exponential proﬁle, which
is indicative of an instability (O’Kane et al. 2019).

So far, few modelling studies have been conducted
to shed light on the mechanisms behind stealth CME
initiation. Comparisons to so-called streamer blowout
CMEs have been drawn in which a streamer brightens
and swells in the days prior to its eruption. Applying
this scenario to modelling of stealth CMEs involves stor-
ing energy through slow shearing motions such as dif-
ferential rotation, that displaces the footpoints of the
coronal ﬁeld along an extended polarity inversion line
(Vourlidas and Webb 2018), with reconnection playing
the key role in ejecting the stealth CME structure and no
pre-eruption ﬂux rope necessarily being present (Lynch
et al. 2016). The shortage of modelling studies is likely
related to the relatively low number of detailed observa-
tional studies, caused by the diﬃculties of observing a
relatively high-altitude structure formed in weaker mag-
netic ﬁeld and within lower plasma density regions.

This study bridges observations and magnetic ﬁeld
modelling for stealth CMEs. We build on the previ-
ous work of Nitta and Mulligan (2017) and O’Kane
et al. (2019) who found the source region of a stealth
CME that occurred on 3 March 2011 to be NOAA ac-
tive region (AR) 11165. In this work, we use local and
global magnetic force-free ﬁeld modelling to investigate
the connectivity between the source region and its sur-
roundings. Section 2 outlines the data and methods used
for this study. Section 3 summarises the event, the pre-
vious ﬁndings and the remote sensing results. Section
4 contains the modelling results. Section 5 discusses all
the ﬁnal conclusions.

2. DATA AND METHODS

The evolution of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in
AR 11165 was analysed using the Helioseismic and Mag-

UT on 3-Mar-2011.

netic Imager data (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al.
2011). HMI takes full disc images of the Sun, mak-
ing narrow-band measurements around the photospheric
line 6173 ˚A and enabling the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld to be derived. The AR ﬂux is calculated using the
Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches data series
(SHARP, Bobra et al. 2014). Only ﬂux density values
greater than ±150 G are considered.

The evolution of the EUV corona in the time lead-
ing up to and during the stealth CME that was ob-
served on 3 March 2011 is studied using data from
SDO and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory
(STEREO, Kaiser et al. 2008). Observations were ob-
tained from the 304 ˚A, 193 ˚A and 211 ˚A passbands by
the SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen
et al. 2011) with a 5 minute cadence. At the time of
the eruption STEREO-A was 87◦ ahead of Earth and
STEREO-B was 95◦ behind (see Figure 1). The 195 ˚A
(5 minute cadence) and 171 ˚A (2 hour cadence) pass-
bands from STEREO EUVI, which forms part of the
Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Inves-
tigation instrument suite (SECCHI, Howard et al. 2008),
were used to analyse the plasma emission structures of
the stealth CME source region. The EUV data were
subject to three image processing techniques.

nique (MGN, Morgan and Druckm¨uller 2014) that

Morgan 2017; O’Kane et al. 2019).

Morgan et al. 2006) technique that enhances oﬀ-
limb structures in EUV or white light coronagraph
data.

3. Diﬀerence imaging that reveals dynamic changes
in the corona. For stealth CMEs it is necessary
to use temporal separations of 30 minutes or more
(Nitta and Mulligan 2017; O’Kane et al. 2019) due
to the relatively slow evolution of these events.

The NRGF-processed COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs
onboard the STEREO spacecraft were used to identify
the stealth CME, and determine its plane-of-sky prop-
agation direction and kinematics (mainly determined
from the STEREO-B perspective). The combined EUV
and coronagraph datasets provide overlapping ﬁelds of
view; EUVI observes to a height of around 1.7 R(cid:12) from
Sun centre, COR1 observes from 1.5 - 4 R(cid:12), and COR2
from 2.5 - 15 R(cid:12).

The kinematics of the eruption were determined us-
ing the COR1 data following the method of Byrne et al.
(2013). This approach uses a residual re-sampling boot-
strapping technique combined with the Savitsky-Golay
algorithm to estimate the errors associated with the
kinematics and derive the point-to-point velocity and
acceleration of the CME. This approach has been shown
by Byrne et al. (2013) to be more rigorous than a nor-
mal numerical derivative approach and enables an esti-
mation of the point-to-point kinematics that would not
be possible using a simple ﬁt to the distance-time data.

3. OBSERVATIONAL OVERVIEW

The stealth CME was ﬁrst detected in the Large An-
gle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 data
as a partial halo at 05:48 UT on 3 March 2011. This
event has previously been studied by Nitta and Mulli-
gan (2017) who showed evidence of weak dimming sig-
natures that indicated its source region was AR 11165.
The analysis by O’Kane et al. (2019) further supports
this ﬁnding and additionally indicates that the CME
could be the result of the eruption of a magnetic struc-
ture likely located at an altitude of ∼ 1.34 R(cid:12) from Sun-
centre, as determined from radio data. Figure 2 shows
the location of AR 11165 in the southern hemisphere
near disc centre (left and central panels) and the clear
circular cross-section structure of the ejecta as seen in
STEREO-A COR2 data (right panel). In the northern
hemisphere, a number of larger and more complex ARs
were present. In this section we provide an overview of
the evolution of the line-of-sight photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld, corona and the kinematics of the CME from an
observational perspective.

3.1. Photospheric Magnetic Field Evolution

AR 11165 has a small bipolar magnetic conﬁguration.
As detailed in O’Kane et al. (2019) AR 11165 began to
emerge on 25 February 2011 at the polarity inversion
line of a previously decayed AR. In fact, the polarity
inversion line was the site of repeated ﬂux emergence
with further episodes of emergence observed over a time
period of ∼ 44 hours starting at 10:00 UT on 28 Febru-
ary 2011. Figure 3 (bottom panel) shows the evolution
of the radial component of the ﬂux in the AR, with a
6-hour running average from 12 minute cadence data.

the periphery of the AR bright core: two episodes occur
after the ﬂux emergence has ended (see Figure 3) but
prior to the stealth CME and one occurs at the time
of the stealth CME probable onset. The ﬂare ribbons
are faint and lack the classic hooks that would typically
be observed in association with the eruption of a ﬂux
rope. However, given that stealth CMEs lack clear ob-
servational signatures due to their lower energy, weaker
ﬂare ribbons (or incomplete ribbons, because not all
ﬁeld lines undergoing reconnection have heated plasma
at their footpoints) are to be expected. Then, the faint
ﬂare ribbons are in keeping with the stealth nature of the
CME. Figure 4 shows that the ﬂare ribbons are at least
partially rooted in the dispersed magnetic ﬁeld of the
previously decayed AR, rather than involving the newly
emerging ﬂux. This is most apparent in the ﬂare ribbons
that are located on the positive polarity ﬁeld and indi-
cates that the associated reconnection process involves
structures that are overlying the emerging bipole.

The ﬁrst episode of ﬂare ribbon formation begins on
2 March 2011 at ∼06:10 UT (Figure 4, panel 2). The
ribbons remain illuminated for around 4 hours and are
also temporally coincident with a reorganisation of the
corona as seen in AIA 193 ˚A data. Details of the coro-
nal evolution are given in (O’Kane et al. 2019) but in
summary the lower altitude section of a loop structure
apparently connected to the eastern ribbon dims and
appears to expand at ∼06:10 UT on 2 March 2011.
STEREO-A EUVI 195 ˚A data also show the motion
of this loop structure on the eastern side. From this
perspective a southward motion of the loop leg is also
detected.

The second episode of two-ribbon ﬂare formation be-
gins on 2 March 2011 at ∼11:00 UT and the ribbons
remain bright for several hours fading by ∼15:00 UT
on 2 March 2011 (Figure 4, panel 3). As is the case
with the ﬁrst ﬂare ribbon episode, the ribbons of the
second episode form and are extended on the western
side further to the north than the AR main positive
polarity concentration. Both the ﬁrst and the second
ribbon episodes are temporally coincident with coronal
brightenings observed in the AIA 335 ˚A waveband data
at 06:30 UT and 15:45 UT on 2 March 2011. STEREO
EUVI 195 ˚A data also show a brightening of the active
region and the formation of new loops at 07:30 UT and
11:30 UT, coincident in time with the ﬁrst and second
episode of ribbon formation respectively. However these
brightenings are not suﬃcient to produce ﬂares that are
detectable in the GOES soft X-ray light curve. No sep-
aration of the two ribbons is observed in either episode
in keeping with the conﬁned nature of the ﬂares (i.e. no
eruptions were observed). This, along with the location

The top panel shows a snapshot at 14:58 UT on 28 Feburary
2011, with negative and positive magnetic ﬁeld surrounded
by red and blue contours at ±150 G, respectively. The bot-
tom panel shows the evolution of the positive and negative
ﬂux over the 84 hour period, before and after the stealth
CME, from 00:00 UT on 28 February 2011 to 12:00 UT on
3 March 2011. The black solid line indicates the time of the
HMI snapshot in the top panel, whilst the three dashed lines
indicate the times of the three two-ribbon formation episodes
discussed in Section 3.2. The third of these episodes is prob-
ably associated with the stealth CME initiation.

the negative and positive ﬂuxes is likely due to the dif-
ﬁculty in distinguishing the negative ﬂux emerging as
part of AR 11165 from that of the pre-existing negative
ﬂux, some of which has been captured by the method
used.

3.2. Evolution of the corona prior to eruption
The MGN processed 304 ˚A AIA data show that AR
11165 has a bright core interwoven with dark absorb-
ing plasma threads (see Figure 4). The 304 ˚A data also
reveal three episodes of two-ribbon ﬂare formation at

Figure 4. Two-ribbon formation as seen in the MGN processed AIA 304 ˚A data (second, third and fourth panels) with HMI
line-of-sight magnetogram for comparison (ﬁrst panel). There are three main episodes of two-ribbon formation shown by the
AIA 304 ˚A data. The ribbon locations are indicated by the white arrows on the HMI magnetic map for the ﬁrst episode. The
ﬁrst two episodes are associated with conﬁned ﬂaring and, as seen in the second and third panels, the ribbon locations are
similar except for an elongation to the south of the northern ribbon (notice the additional arrow in the third panel). The third
episode is probably associated with the eruption of the stealth CME; the ribbons move outwards and appear farther to the east
and west of the AR center. In all cases the ribbons look patchy and their intensity is lower than that of the kernels located
closer to the AR magnetic inversion line.

of the ribbons at the AR periphery, indicates that the
reconnection site is located above its core ﬁeld.

At ∼22:30 UT on 2 March 2011 the two ribbons ac-
tivate for a third time, however this time they separate
away from the AR core (Figure 4, panel 4). The two
ribbons are observed to separate from each other over
an approximately eight-hour period. Interpreting these
ﬂare ribbons in the context of the standard two-ribbon
ﬂare model and subsequent studies (see Moore and
Labonte 1980; Kitahara and Kurokawa 1990; Fletcher
et al. 2004; Qiu 2009) would indicate that, during the
ﬁrst two episodes of two-ribbon formation, a reconﬁg-
uration of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld above the newly
emerged ﬂux (AR core) occurs. This reconﬁguration
involves magnetic reconnection which most probably
played a key role in forming the structure that then
went on to erupt during the third episode of ribbon oc-
currence. This ﬁnding adds to the growing body of work
showing that eruptive structures can form during recon-
nection episodes in the corona that produce conﬁned
ﬂares and which could have a ﬂux rope conﬁguration
(Patsourakos et al. 2013; James et al. 2017). From the
displacement of the ﬂare ribbons with respect to a direc-
tion parallel to the polarity inversion line and the shear
of the AR coronal loops we infer that its magnetic ﬁeld
was of positive chirality, in agreement with the positive
magnetic shear found in coronal loops (see also section
4.1 and Figure 9).

STEREO-A COR1 data show that prior to the stealth
CME two other small and faint Earth-directed erup-
tions occur. The ﬁrst being initially seen in the COR1

ﬁeld-of-view at 06:00 UT and the second at 11:30 UT
on 2 March 2011. However, these eruptions originate
from the northern hemisphere and not from AR 11165.
Their small and faint structure makes determining their
speciﬁc source region challenging. A small eruption is
observed from AR11167 which is likely the source of
the CME observed at 06:00 UT. Meanwhile, AIA and
EUVI data show ongoing dimming on the southern side
of NOAA ARs 11163 and 11164 between 00:00 UT and
08:00 UT on 2 March 2011, which may be associated
with the CME observed in COR1 at 11:30 UT.

3.3. Kinematics of the stealth CME eruption

The lack of strong plasma emission from the erupting
structure in EUV wavebands (and hence the classiﬁca-
tion of this event as a stealth CME) prevents a detailed
analysis of the CME initiation and rise proﬁle in EUV
imaging data. However, a bright concave-up structure,
that is best seen in STEREO-B EUVI 171 ˚A data, is
observed at 00:14 UT (Figure 5, panel e), 1.75 hours
after the third episode of ﬂare ribbon formation. The
2-hour cadence of EUVI 171 ˚A data prevents a good
analysis of the temporal evolution of this structure but
it is seen again in the following image at 02:14 UT on 3
March 2011 (Figure 5, panel f). The concave-up struc-
ture observed in CMEs is interpreted as indicating the
underside of a ﬂux rope.

Likewise, in the coronagraph data (COR1), there is no
discernible structure at the leading edge of the stealth
CME, only a concave-up structure at its trailing edge.
The concave-up structure is followed in STEREO-B
COR1 in order to determine the speed and acceleration

at 00:14 UT and 02:14 UT on 3 March 2011 as indicated by the red arrows in panels e and f. The concave-up structure is not
seen in panel d.

of the eruption. However, it is not possible to conﬁ-
dently track the same plasma structure between EUVI
data and coronagraph data due to the diﬀering emis-
sion processes, so the kinematics of the CME are cal-
culated only from STEREO-B COR data with a note
that the EUVI-B concave-up structure is measured to
be at a height of 1.54 R(cid:12) from Sun-centre in the plane-
of-the-sky at 00:14 UT and 1.67 R(cid:12) at 02:14 UT on 3
March 2011 (Figure 5 panels e and f), giving a very ap-
proximate plane-of-sky rise speed of 17 km s−1. These
heights are consistent with the underside of the stealth
CME when it is ﬁrst detected in STEREO-B COR1 data
early on 3 March 2011 (see Figure 6).

The top panel of Figure 6 shows the height-time vari-
ation of the erupting CME using data from STEREO-B
COR1 along a radial slice at 120◦ measured in the clock-
wise direction from solar north. Figure 6 panel b shows
the identiﬁed evolution of the underside of the stealth

CME ﬁtted using a Savitsky-Golay bootstrapping tech-
nique (cf. Byrne et al. 2013). This approach enables the
point-to-point variation of the speed and acceleration of
the CME to be estimated as shown in panels c and d of
Figure 6. The initial measured speed of the white light
CME, as determined from coronagraph data, at 04:23
UT on 3 March was found to be ∼ 31 km s−1, with an
acceleration of ∼ 102 m s−2, consistent with the speed
found from EUVI-B. From the kinematic data and the
AIA 304 ˚A ﬂare ribbon formation we conclude that the
stealth CME initiation began in the time period between
22:30 UT on 2 March 2011 (the time in which the third
episode of ﬂare ribbons begin) to 00:14 UT on 3 March
2011 (the time in which the concave-up structure is ﬁrst
observed in EUVI-B).

3.4. Transequatorial Loops

Magnetic Environment of a Stealth CME

the presence of these large scale loops before the onset
of the stealth CME but after the time period in which
the coronal ﬁeld above AR 11165 was reconﬁgured via
magnetic reconnection as evidenced by the two-ribbon
ﬂares. We have searched for transequatorial loops in soft
X-ray imaging data using Hinode/XRT; however, there
is a gap in the full-disc XRT data between 2 March at
≈ 06:20 UT and 3 March 2011 at ≈ 06:20 UT.

After the stealth CME, the transequatorial loops are
still observed, albeit at a higher altitude indicating that
a reconﬁguration occurred, perhaps due to reconnection
driven by the expanding structure of the stealth CME.
STEREO-A EUVI data indicate that these higher alti-
tude loops can be seen by 08:25 UT on 3 March and in
STEREO-B EUVI data by 19:55 UT on the same day.
The loops are persistent and continue to be observed
into 4 March 2011 at which time STEREO-B data show
that the top of the transequatorial loops reach a height
of ≈234 Mm above the photosphere (1.34 R(cid:12) from Sun-
centre, see Figure 7). The loops are not clear in AIA at
this point, presumably due to the low plasma density of
the loops against a higher density background.

4. MAGNETIC FIELD MODELLING

To put the set of observations in a framework that al-
lows us to understand the origin of the stealth CME, we
have modelled the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. We use two
diﬀerent approaches, a local model in Cartesian coordi-
nates and two global models in spherical coordinates.

4.1. AR 11165 Magnetic Field Model

Figure 8, two left panels, shows the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration and the coronal emission struc-
tures of the northern hemisphere active region complex
formed by ARs 11163 and 11164. These ARs exhibit
sheared loops as can be seen by the way they cross our
approximated polarity inversion lines (PILs, depicted as
red-dashed lines). In particular, the PIL in AR 11164
is quite complex and we only trace the main one. The
global coronal structure of this AR displays roughly an
inverse S-shape. The PIL of AR 11163 is much simpler
and the loop inclinations to the PIL marginally also in-
dicate a negative shear (see e.g. Palmerio et al. 2017).

Figure 8, two right hand-side panels, show that AR
11165 has positively sheared loops as is expected from
the hemispheric helicity trend for ARs in the southern
hemisphere (Pevtsov and Balasubramaniam 2003). To
conﬁrm the sign of the shear, we have extrapolated the
line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld of AR 11165 into the corona,
using the HMI magnetogram under the linear force-free
ﬁeld (LFFF) approximation (∇ × (cid:126)B = α (cid:126)B, with α con-
stant, Mandrini et al. 1996; D´emoulin et al. 1997). An

the tracked points as the median of the Savisky-Golay ﬁt

timated velocity and acceleration proﬁles respectively, with
the median (solid black line), interquartile boundaries (in-

The evolution of the corona at a larger scale, en-
compassing AR 11165 and the complex formed by
is studied using
ARs 11163 and 11164 to the north,
SDO/AIA images and STEREO/EUVI data. As seen
in STEREO EUVI 195 ˚A waveband data from both
Ahead and Behind spacecraft, transequatorial loops ex-
ist between these ARs in the northern and southern
hemispheres. STEREO-A shows that these loops are
visible by 18:30 UT on 2 March 2011, while they are
observed by 19:55 UT in STEREO-B. From the Earth
perspective, the transequatorial loops are observed in
AIA 193 ˚A data around 19:40 UT on 2 March 2011 (Fig-
ure 7 left panel). These observations collectively show

example of the model is shown in Figure 9. The value of
the free parameter of the model, α, is set to best match
the observed loops at the time of the magnetogram used
for the extrapolation, following the procedure discussed
by Green et al. (2002). The best-matching value is pos-

itive, α = 6.3 × 10−3 Mm−1. Our model also carries
out a transformation of coordinates from the local AR
frame to the observed one (see D´emoulin et al. 1997) so
that our computed ﬁeld lines can be compared to the
AIA observed loops (as shown in Figure 9).

4.2. The Three AR Complex Using a Cartesian

Magnetic Field Model

Since the northern complex of ARs and the stealth
CME source region are connected by transequatorial
loops (see Section 3.4), we now investigate the magnetic
connectivity between them. Because of the presence of
moderate opposite magnetic shear in the three ARs, we

extrapolate the same HMI photospheric magnetogram
used to model the coronal ﬁeld of AR 11165 (Figure 9)
under a potential ﬁeld approach, using an area that en-
compasses both the northern and southern regions as the
boundary condition. A Cartesian model at such a large
size-scale is disputable, however, its use allows us to con-
sider a single magnetogram including the three ARs with
a higher spatial resolution (i.e. our non-uniform grid size

the magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalues. For a
negative null, dark blue (light blue) corresponds to the
highest (lowest) negative eigenvalue in the null fan plane
and red to the null spine eigenvalue.

We trace sets of ﬁeld lines in the neighbourhood of the
null point, with starting positions in the direction of the
three eigenvectors, to explore the diﬀerent connectivity
domains. This connectivity is illustrated in both pan-
els of Figure 10. The left panel corresponds to the ob-
server’s point of view along the Sun-Earth line, while the
right panel shows the location of the null point as viewed
from the solar south. The ﬁeld lines in both panels have
been drawn in blue and red to indicate what we envi-
sioned could be the pre-reconnection set (blue ﬁeld lines)
and the post-reconnection set (red ﬁeld lines), following
the evolution of the emission structures and transequa-
torial loops discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4. The illus-
trated connectivity shows that the positive polarity of
AR 11165 is connected to the dispersed negative polar-
ity of AR 11163 and its negative polarity to the positive
polarity of AR 11164. The footpoints of the ﬁeld lines
in AR 11165 are located in the vicinity of the twin EUV
dimmings observed in association with the stealth CME,
as shown in Figure 8 of O’Kane et al. (2019). The lo-
cation of the dimming regions, their evolution over a
9 hour period and their relationship to the CMEs are
discussed in detail in that article.

4.3. Global Magnetic Field Model

The magnetic null point found in the local Cartesian
model could play a crucial role in facilitating the initi-
ation of the stealth CME; therefore, we have searched
for its presence in a global potential ﬁeld source sur-
face (PFSS) model, which could also give us clues about
the location of ‘open’ ﬁeld lines, their shape, and their
possibility of channeling the stealth CME and inﬂuenc-
ing its propagation direction into the interplanetary (IP)
medium. Because of the relevance of the role of this null
point, we have checked the robustness of its presence us-
ing two diﬀerent approaches to compute the PFSS global
model.

Both PFSS models use as their lower boundary con-
dition the HMI magnetic ﬁeld synoptic map from Car-
rington rotation (CR) 2107, that ran from 16 Febru-
ary to 16 March 2011. HMI synoptic maps are com-
puted from line-of-sight magnetograms by combining
central meridian data from 20 magnetograms collected
over a 4-hour interval. A synoptic map is made
with the magnetograms collected over a full solar ro-
tation (≈ 27.7-day interval) with 3600 × 1440 steps
in longitude and sine latitude. Both models assume
that the magnetic ﬁeld becomes purely radial at a

used the line-of-sight HMI magnetogram shown in Figure 8 as
boundary condition. Magnetic ﬁeld contours at ±50, 200 G,
positive (negative) shown in magenta (blue) color are over-
laid on the AIA 193 ˚A image closer in time to the magne-
togram. A set of computed ﬁeld lines, matching the global
shape of the observed coronal loops has been added in con-
tinuous red lines. The circles present at the end of some ﬁeld
lines indicate that these lines touch one of the lateral or the
top sides of the numerical box used for the drawing (not the
one used to compute the ﬁeld). The axes in this panel are

view.

corresponds to HMI spatial resolution at the center of
our computational box) and closer in time to the anal-
ysed events, reﬂecting more accurately the photospheric
conditions. The results found in this section will be
veriﬁed in Section 4.3 using a global model in spherical
coordinates.

We searched for topological structures in the extrap-
olated model and found the presence of a magnetic null
point to the north-west of AR 11165 (see Figure 10).
The local ﬁeld connectivity around a magnetic null can
be described using the linear term of the Taylor expan-
sion of the ﬁeld around such a point (see D´emoulin et al.
1994; Mandrini et al. 2014, 2015, and references therein).
From the diagonalization of the Jacobian matrix of the
ﬁeld, we ﬁnd three eigenvectors and the corresponding
eigenvalues, which add up to zero to satisfy the ﬁeld
divergence-free condition. The eigenvalues are real for
coronal conditions (a force-free ﬁeld). A positive null
point has two positive eigenvalues and conversely for a
negative null. Figure 10 illustrates the location of a neg-
ative null point found at a height of 234 Mm above the
photosphere (1.34 R(cid:12) from Sun centre); this is indicated
by the intersection of three segments that correspond to
the directions of the three eigenvectors of the Jacobian
matrix. These segments are colour coded to indicate

The left panel is drawn in the observer’s point of view, while the right panel is a view from the solar south. Field lines represent
pre-reconnected (in blue colour) and post-reconnected ones (in red colour), as inferred from the observed evolution described

dimming regions are observed to evolve, as shown in Figure 8 right panel in O’Kane et al. (2019).

In the left panel, the magnetic ﬁeld is computed with the FDIPS code. The null
point is viewed when AR 11165 is numerically rotated to the central meridian. A set of ﬁeld lines has been computed from its
neighbourhood using the same blue and red convention as in Figure 10. These ﬁeld lines show a similar connectivity as the ones
in the Cartesian ﬁeld model. Closed ﬁeld lines are added in black mostly for context, while open ones are shown in pink. In
the right panel, the model is computed using the pfssy code. We illustrate the connectivity surrounding the null point setting
AR 11165 on the west limb. This shows the shape and direction of the ‘open’ ﬁeld. The vertical coloured bar represents the
magnitude of the ﬁeld in Gauss along the ﬁeld lines. The Python code also includes the computation of B2, within the slice

value 2.5 R(cid:12). Full details concerning the construction

of synoptic maps can be found in the HMI web-site
(http://jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/SynopticMaps).

12

O’Kane et al.

Our ﬁrst PFSS modeling approach uses the Finite Dif-
ference Iterative Potential-Field Solver (FDIPS) code
described by T´oth et al. (2011). The FDIPS code,
which is freely available from the Center for Space
Environment Modeling (CSEM) at the University of
Michigan (http://csem.engin.umich.edu/tools/FDIPS),
makes use of an iterative ﬁnite-diﬀerence method to
solve the Laplace equation for the magnetic ﬁeld. The
spatial resolution of this particular model is 1◦ in lon-
gitude (360 longitudinal grid points), 0.11 in the sine of
latitude (180 latitudinal grid points) and 0.01 R(cid:12) in the
radial direction. We searched for a null point using a
method similar to that discussed in the previous section
but using a spherical geometry for the coronal ﬁeld. Fig-
ure 11 left panel shows the location of a null point and
the connectivity of the ﬁeld when the Sun is rotated so
that AR 11165 is facing the observer. This null point
is located at a height of ≈ 118 Mm, lower than in the
Cartesian model, but the connectivity clearly resembles
the one of that model (Figure 10).

Our second approach uses the PFSS solver in Python
In this case we

re-sampled the original ﬁeld spatial resolution to a 540
and 270 pixels in longitude and latitude, respectively.
This solver also uses ﬁnite diﬀerences, and follows the
method in van Ballegooijen et al. (2000) to eﬀectively
compute discrete spherical harmonics global functions.
We also found a magnetic null point at a similar lo-
cation and with a similar connectivity in its neighbour-
hood as before, but at a height of ≈ 104 Mm. Therefore,
though there are diﬀerences that come from the diﬀer-
ent approaches used, and diﬀerent boundary conditions
between the local and global models, the presence of this
null point between the AR complex in the north and the
stealth CME source region is consistent. Finally, both
PFSS models suggest that there are ‘open’ ﬁeld lines
above the stealth CME source region that are inclined
to the south (Figure 11, mainly the right panel).

The inclination of the ‘open’ ﬁeld lines as well as
the reaction of the surrounding potential ﬁeld, present
over AR 11165, may inﬂuence the CME propagation di-
rection (e.g., Cremades et al. 2006; Gopalswamy et al.
2009). The erupting magnetic ﬁeld is both compress-
ing and bending the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld. This
induces a reactive force with both a gradient of mag-
netic pressure and a magnetic tension, with both forces
proportional to B2. B2 is seen to be higher above the
two northern hemisphere ARs, lower in the region of
the null point, and increases again over AR 11165 (see
Figure 11). The CME is therefore likely to be inﬂu-
enced by B2 present in the surrounding potential ﬁeld,
in agreement with previous studies (Gui et al. 2011; Kay

Figure 12. The sketch illustrates the scenario we propose
for the origin of the stealth CME in Section 5. The erupting
structure is drawn in red within AR 11165 (with footpoints
in magnetic polarities 1 and 2). This structure is probably
the result of the two episodes of two-ribbon formation oc-
curring before the stealth CME. The blue ﬁeld lines located
above the erupting structure belong to the arcade which will
reconnect at the null point with the set of blue ﬁeld lines (for
which we only show one) associated to the AR complex in
the north (simpliﬁed to only include the relevant magnetic
polarities as 3 and 4). This reconnection process will result in
the set of two red ﬁeld lines representing the transequatorial
loops discussed in Section 3.4.

et al. 2013; Sieyra et al. 2020, and references therein) and
be deﬂected southward contrary to the general equato-
rial deﬂection of many CMEs (Cremades and Bothmer
2004). The presence of open ﬁeld lines, deﬂected to-
wards the south, is also expected to deﬂect the CME
along them (M¨akel¨a et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2020, and
references therein).

5. CONCLUSIONS

This study analyses the stealth CME of 3 March 2011
and seeks to gain insight into the magnetic environment
in which the eruption occurred. Detailed data analy-
sis and the use of image processing techniques have re-
vealed observational signatures of the evolution of the
magnetic ﬁeld toward eruption that are then interpreted
in the framework of three potential magnetic ﬁeld coro-
nal models.

In summary, ﬂux emergence dominates AR11165 in
the lead up to the eruption, which appears to play a
key role in creating the conditions suﬃcient for mag-
netic reconnection in the pre-existing arcade. Episodes
of reconnection are evidenced by the observation of two-
ribbon ﬂares in the stealth CME source region (see Sec-
tion 3.2). Two episodes of magnetic reconnection occur
in the decayed sheared ﬁeld above the emerging bipole

of AR 11165 forming the structure that later erupts
as the stealth CME. All coronal models show a null
point whose associated ﬁeld lines connect AR11165 in
the southern hemisphere and ARs 11163 and 11164 in
the north. The presence of a coronal null point (and re-
connection at this null) in the large scale ﬁeld above the
upper arcade of the pre-eruptive structure, which may
be a ﬂux rope, means that a rapidly decreasing ﬁeld
strength with height could enable the rope to become
unstable in the hours after it is formed. Upon eruption,
the stealth CME is deﬂected to the south, due to the
‘open’ ﬁeld, and the overall variation in magnetic pres-
sure. The eruption drives further reconnection at the
null point creating new transequatorial loops that are
observed in EUVI data.

In conclusion, our study supports the interpretation of
stealth CMEs as a manifestation of normal solar erup-
tions, as opposed to belonging to a completely diﬀerent
class of solar phenomena. As events characterized by
weak energetics, the magnetic structures associated to
stealth CMEs seem to require a particular environment
to successfully erupt, provided, in the case reported here,
by a high-altitude null point. Future studies will investi-
gate whether this is a general property of stealth CMEs.
