Background: Type I x-ray bursts are the most frequently observed thermonuclear explosions in the galaxy,
resulting from thermonuclear runaway on the surface of an accreting neutron star. The 30S(α, p) reaction plays a
critical role in burst models, yet insuﬃcient experimental information is available to calculate a reliable, precise
rate for this reaction.
Purpose: Our measurement was conducted to search for states in 34Ar and determine their quantum properties.
In particular, natural-parity states with large α-decay partial widths should dominate the stellar reaction rate.
Method: We performed the ﬁrst measurement of 30S+α resonant elastic scattering up to a center-of-mass energy
of 5.5 MeV using a radioactive ion beam. The experiment utilized a thick gaseous active target system and silicon
detector array in inverse kinematics.
Results: We obtained an excitation function for 30S(α, α) near 150◦ in the center-of-mass frame. The exper-
imental data were analyzed with R-Matrix calculations, and we observed three new resonant patterns between
11.1 and 12.1 MeV, extracting their properties of resonance energy, widths, spin, and parity.
Conclusions: We calculated the resonant thermonuclear reaction rate of 30S(α, p) based on all available experi-
mental data of 34Ar and found an upper limit about one order of magnitude larger than a rate determined using
a statistical model. The astrophysical impact of these two rates has been investigated through one-zone postpro-
cessing type I x-ray burst calculations. We ﬁnd that our new upper limit for the 30S(α, p)33Cl rate signiﬁcantly
aﬀects the predicted nuclear energy generation rate during the burst.

INTRODUCTION

Type I x-ray bursters (XRBs) are a class of astronom-
ical objects observed to increase in luminosity by factors
of typically tens to several hundreds [1] for a short period
of time (tens of seconds) with the photon ﬂux peaking
in the x ray and a total energy output of about 1039–
1040 ergs [2, 3]. The sources of such emissions repeat
these outbursts typically on time scales of hours to days,

tional Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

allowing for the extensive study of the burst morphol-
ogy of individual XRBs. In our galaxy, over ninety such
sources are presently known since their initial discovery
some forty years ago. XRBs are modelled very success-
fully as a neutron star accreting material rich in hydro-
gen and/or helium from a low-mass companion. The ac-
cretion mechanism causes the formation of an electron-
degenerate envelope around the neutron star, where the
thin-shell instability triggers a runaway thermonuclear
explosion at peak temperatures of 1.3 − 2.0 GK [4–8],
which we observe as an x-ray burst.

The sharp rise of the x-ray ﬂuence is understood to
be powered by explosive helium burning on the neutron-
deﬁcient side of the Segr`e chart [6, 8–11].
In a mixed
hydrogen and helium shell, the explosive nucleosynthesis
initially manifests as a series of (α, p)(p, γ) reactions on
oxygen seed nuclei near the proton drip line (14,15O),
called the αp-process [12]. One such sequence in this
burning pathway is

3α → 12C(p, γ)13N(p, γ)14O(α, p)17F(p, γ)
18Ne(α, p)21Na(p, γ)22Mg(α, p)25Al,

which continues as

25Al(p, γ)26Si(α, p)29P(p, γ)

In this sequence, the (α, p) reactions proceed through
Tz = N −Z
2 = −1 compound nuclei. The αp-process gives
way to the rapid proton-capture process (rp process) near
the Z ≈ 20 region owing to the ever increasing Coulomb
barrier and decreasing (α, p) Q values. Aside from the
two protons consumed in the nuclear trajectory from 12C
to 14O, the αp process is schematically pure helium burn-
ing (since the abundance of hydrogen is constant), and
it does not include any β+ decays which tend to hamper
the energy generation rate in explosive nucleosynthesis.
While a plethora of nuclear processes tend to take place
in a given regime of stellar nucleosynthesis, typically the
precise rates of only a handful of these processes inﬂuence
the predicted nature and magnitude of actual astrophys-
It is these speciﬁc nuclear quantities

which should be well constrained by laboratory experi-
mentation. This general picture is conﬁrmed in XRBs,
where the nuclear reaction network includes hundreds of
species and thousands of nuclear transmutations. Studies
have shown that it is only a small subset of these nuclear
transmutations which need to be known precisely, as they
make a predominant contribution to the nuclear trajec-
tory to higher mass and energy generation [13], at least
for the examined models.

The 30S(α, p) reaction is identiﬁed as one such impor-
tant reaction, contributing more than 5% to the total
energy generation [13], inﬂuencing the elemental abun-
dances in the burst ashes [13] relevant to compositional
inertia (see, e.g.,
for a description of this phe-
nomenon), moving material away from the 30S waiting
point [15], and possibly accounting for double peaked

[14]

XRBs [16]. A recent study found the 30S(α, p) reaction
sensitivity in XRBs among the top four in a single zone
model [17], as well as having a prominent (but unquan-
tiﬁed) impact on the burst light curve in a multizone
model.

A ﬁrmer understanding of the input nuclear physics
for XRB models will allow for more reliable comparison
with observations to constrain neutron star binary sys-
tem properties, such as accretion rate and metallicity, as
well as the neutron star radius itself [18–23].

The (α, p) reactions occurring on lower mass nuclei
such as 14O and 18Ne have been measured directly [24–
28], and the properties of resonances in the compound
nuclei 18Ne and 22Mg have been the subject of a number
of indirect studies (see, e.g., Refs. [29, 30] and references
therein). In spite of these extensive works, those cross
sections still remain quite uncertain. Unfortunately, the
situation is much more dire in the case of the (α, p) re-
actions induced on higher mass targets such as 30S. The
only experimental information on the structure of 34Ar
above the α threshold and the 30S(α, p) stellar reaction
rate is limited to a preliminary report on a transfer re-
action study of the compound nucleus 34Ar at high ex-
citation energy [31] and a time-reversal study [32]. The
present work is the ﬁrst experimental investigation using
the entrance channel 30S+α.

II. EXPERIMENT

We performed the ﬁrst measurement of α resonant elas-
tic scattering on a 30S radioactive isotope beam (RIB)
using a thick target in inverse kinematics [33]. The ex-
periment was carried out at the CNS Radioactive Ion
Beam separator (CRIB) [34, 35], owned and operated by
the Center for Nuclear Study (CNS), the University of
Tokyo, and located in the RIKEN Nishina Center. The
CRIB facility has been a workhorse for measurements
of elastic scattering of primarily astrophysical interest
[36–49], schematically using similar techniques to the one
adopted in the present study.

The

30S RIB was produced inﬂight using the
3He(28Si, 30S)n transfer reaction. A 28Si9+ primary beam
was extracted from an electron cycltron resonance ion
source and accelerated to 7.3 MeV/u by the RIKEN AVF
cyclotron (K ≈ 70) with a typical intensity of 80 pnA.
We impinged the 28Si beam on the production target lo-
cated at the entrance focal plane to CRIB, comprised of
a windowed, cryogenic gas cell [50]. 3He gas at 400 Torr
was cooled to an eﬀective temperature of 90 K with LN2;
the gas was conﬁned by 2.5-µm Havar windows in a cylin-
drical chamber with a length of 80 mm and a diameter of
20 mm, yielding a 3He target thickness of approximately
1.7 mg cm−2. As the fully stripped species 30S16+ is
the easiest to separate and distinguish from the primary
beam, we used Be (2.5 µm) and C (300 µg cm−2) stripper
foils immediately after the production target; when the
Be (C) stripper foil was new, the 30S16+ purity was 88%

FIG. 1. Schematic of the experimental setup, consisting of two parallel plate avalanche counters (PPACs), the active target,
and silicon telescope arrays. Note that between PPACb and the active target, the beam impinges on an entrance window,
which retains the active target ﬁll gas. The beam is tracked in the central low-gain region (“active target region”, 20 cm),
surrounded on three sides by high-gain regions and silicon telescopes to measure outgoing light ions (right side telescope not
depicted). Beneath each gas electron multiplier (GEM) is a readout pattern, separated into 4 mm thick backgammon pads.
∆E is simply proportional to the charge collected by each pad. The coordinate system is one where the beam axis deﬁnes
positive Z, the rest following left-handed conventions. Z and X positions are determined by the pad number and comparing
charge collection on either side of the backgammon, respectively. The Y position is determined by the electron drift time.

(67%), but decreased dramatically within hours as the
beam degraded the foils. Studies are ongoing to investi-
gate the eﬀects of stripper foil degradation on beam pu-
rity and intensity. The resulting cocktail beam was sepa-
rated by a double achromatic system (set to ∆p
p = 1.875%
with slits at the dispersive focal plane) and further pu-
riﬁed with a Wien (velocity) ﬁlter. The 30S RI beam
arrived on target with typical purity of 28% and an in-
tensity of 8 × 103 pps, successfully injecting 1.6 × 109 30S
ions during the main measurement over two days.

The setup at the experimental focal plane, shown in
Figs. 1 & 2, consisted of two beamline monitors, an
active target system (see below), and an array of sili-
con strip detectors (SSDs). The beamline monitors were
parallel plate avalanche counters (PPACs, enumerated
‘a’ and ‘b’, respectively) [51], which served to track the
beam ions event by event and to produce the trigger sig-
nal for the data acquisition system (DAQ). The DAQ
triggered when both PPACs ﬁred in coincidence with an
SSD to obtain the physics of interest; the DAQ also trig-
gered in a downscaled mode for 1
n PPAC coincidences
(n = 2.2 × 104) regardless of the SSD signals. This trig-
ger setup is standard in CRIB experiments, and it allows
for event-by-event analysis of scattering events as well as
simultaneous diagnosis of the RIB for systematic behav-
ior while keeping a total trigger rate < 1 kHz. Due to
a DAQ error, we could only fully analyze the data from
the forward right-side SSD.

During the RIB production, the eﬃciency of each
PPAC was determined to be quite high (> 99%) con-
sidering the number of events recorded by each detec-
tor; however, at the start of the scattering measurement
PPACb was damaged by several discharges, and its ef-

ﬁciency became somewhat lower (∼ 90%) for most of
the experiment. Each SSD was 0.5 mm thick and had
an active area of 91 × 91 mm2, eight strips on one side,
and a single pad on the reverse. A scattering chamber
ﬁlled with about 1
4 atm 90% natHe + 10% CO2 gas mix-
ture housed both the active target system and the SSDs.1
The He + CO2 gas pressure was monitored continuously
throughout the scattering measurement and managed by
a dedicated system; we set the gas ﬂow controller to cir-
culate fresh gas into the chamber at 20 standard liters
per minute with the evacuation rate regulated to keep a
constant gas pressure of 194.2 ± 0.5 Torr during the en-
tire measurement. The gas-ﬁlled chamber was sealed oﬀ
from the beamline vacuum with a 7.4-µm Kapton foil;
the entrance window was 40 mm in diameter.

An active target is a device where a material serves si-
multaneously as a target and part of a detector, in prin-
ciple allowing one to perform direct measurements at a
beam interaction position. The readout section of our ac-
tive target is an etched copper plate placed under the ﬁeld
cage, opposite to the cathode top plate, so that electrons
created in the electric ﬁeld of the cage by ionizing radi-
ation drift towards it. The readout pads are separated
into four sections: one for detecting the beam or heavy
recoils and three for detecting outgoing light ions. Forty-
eight pads comprise the beam readout section, while the
regions for detecting light ions are comprised of eight
rectangular pads each. The pads are 3.5 mm in depth,
surrounded by 0.25 mm of insulation on all sides (making
0.5 mm of insulation between each pad). Each pad is also

We quantiﬁed the measurement capabilities of the ac-
tive target using both online and oﬄine measurements.
For the low-gain region, we compared the position of 30S
ions derived from the active target to those determined
by extrapolation of the PPAC data. For the high-gain
region, we analyzed the aggregate track width of radia-
tion emitted from a standard α source in a ﬁxed posi-
tion as measured by the active target; the tracks were
software gated to be in coincidence with a geometrically-
central SSD strip. By assuming a standard CRIB PPAC
resolution of ∼ 1 mm based on our experience and the
known ﬁnite strip size of the SSD, we varied the active
target resolution in a Monte Carlo simulation until the
calculations agreed with the data. The performance of
the active target depended on the type of measurement,
quoted below at 1σ. The Y position, determined by the
electron drift time, was the most precise being ≤ 0.5 mm;
the high precision of the drift-time measurement enabled
us to conﬁrm the PPAC resolution, which was found to
be 0.9 mm. The X-position resolution, determined by
charge division in the backgammon pads, was 3 mm.

In the present work, the typical 30S scattering labo-
ratory angle and change in energy loss was diﬃcult to
reliably distinguish from the unscattered beam given the
above resolution for the low-gain GEM in X.

Considering the close spacing of the high-gain GEM
data and their relatively large distance from typical scat-
tering locations, extrapolating the vector of an α par-
ticle’s track results in a large uncertainty.
Instead, we
found that averaging the pad X and Y data over the
center (in Z) of the high-gain GEM reduced the uncer-
tainty and was suﬃcient for our purposes.

The 30S energy on target was measured to be 48.4 ±
2.0 MeV. The stopping power for 30S in the He+CO2 gas
mixture was determined by both a direct measurement of
the beam energy at ﬁve target pressures and by a compar-

the 30S RIB determined by the kinematic solution. As the
high-gain GEM and SSD must both be hit for an event to
register, it is only a portion of the total events which are an-
alyzed. Hints of some resonant structure can be seen around

ison of the shape of the Bragg curve and stopping posi-
tion of the unscattered ions in the active target as shown
in Fig. 3. Excellent agreement was found between the
measurements and the prediction using Ziegler’s method;
the maximum diﬀerence between the measured and cal-
culated 30S residual energy was 700 keV or less than 4%.
The energy loss and the Bragg curve of the contaminant
29P were also reproduced using an identical approach,
giving us conﬁdence in our treatment of the energy loss
in the PPACs, entrance window, and He+CO2 gas mix-
ture. The event-by-event particle identiﬁcation of the
cocktail beam is shown in Fig. 4.

We conﬁrmed the energy loss of α particles using a
standard triple α source and an α beam created by CRIB,
checking that both their Bragg curves and residual en-
ergies agreed with the calculations. A calibrated ∆E–
E spectrum from the 30S+α scattering measurement is
shown in Fig. 5; the ﬁgure shows clearly that the mea-
sured locus is consistent with the theoretical trend for α-
particles. The dynamic range of the high-gain GEMs was
optimized to be 10–100 keV corresponding to the energy
deposit of α particles, which would always be stopped in
the ﬁrst SSD layer unlike high energy protons. As pro-
tons with enough energy to reach an SSD deposit < 5 keV
per pad, they could not be detected by the active target
system.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Determination of cross section

We measured (1) the residual energy of α particles
using an SSD, (2) the beam trajectory using the two

 
 
 
 
 
PPACs, and (3) the recoiling α particle position using the
high-gain portion of the active target. These three pieces
of information are suﬃcient to determine the center-of-
mass energy Ec.m. for elastic scattering, deﬁned as

Ec.m. =

M + m
4M cos2 ϑlab

Eα,

(3)

where M and m are the masses of 30S and 4He, re-
spectively, ϑlab is the laboratory scattering angle, and
Eα is the laboratory energy of the scattered α particle.
Using the experimentally veriﬁed stopping power of the
He+CO2 gas for 30S ions and α particles, we numerically
solved the above kinematic equation event-by-event. We
selected test points along the extrapolated 30S ion tra-
jectory in 1 mm steps, calculating Ec.m. according to the
beam’s energy loss up to each point. Each tested scatter-
ing depth ﬁxes the value of ϑlab by the geometric mea-
surements of the PPACs and high-gain GEM. Finally,
the initial α energy was determined with Eq. (3) and its
residual energy was calculated considering its energy loss
along said path, which we then compared with the en-
ergy recorded by the SSD. The algorithm continued until
the 30S ion came to rest with no solution being found or
when the calculated and measured residual α particle en-
ergy disagreed by less than 100 keV, which we deﬁne as
a true scattering event at that Ec.m.. In the case that
more than one test point satisﬁed these conditions, we
select the Ec.m. with the smallest disagreement between
the measured and calculated residual α energy. The re-
sulting α spectrum is shown in Fig. 6.

The diﬀerential cross section was then calculated using

,

(4)

where Yα is the yield of α particles at each energy bin,
S(Eb) is the stopping power of 30S in He+CO2, Ib is the
number of 30S beam ions injected into the target, n is
the number density of 4He atoms, ∆E is the energy bin
size (100 keV), and ∆Ωc.m. is the center-of-mass solid
angle at each energy bin. The number of beam ions in-
jected into the target Ib was deﬁned as the coincidence
between the two PPACs, recorded as a scaler during the
run, multiplied by the average 30S purity, which includes
a cut for the active target entrance window for successful
injection into the target. The lower eﬃciency of PPACb
cancels out in the deduction of the cross section because
we demanded beam particle detection with the PPACs
for counting both the number of scattering events and
injected beam ions. Since the scattering could take place
over a range of target depths, we calculated the solid an-
gle Ωc.m. from the vantage point of each actual scattering
event and ﬁt the trend with an empirical function. The
yield of α particles Yα was scaled universally by a factor
of 2.0±0.1 to match the calculated magnitude of Ruther-
ford scattering at lower energies; a similar deﬁciency was
observed in the number of α particles (produced in the
cocktail beam by CRIB) detected by the high-gain GEM

compared to the SSD in a low-statistics test run giving a
scaling factor 1.8±0.3 (see Secs. II B and III D below and
[52] for further details). A series of measurements
Ref.
are already planned to further investigate and constrain
this scaling factor. The resulting excitation function is
shown in Fig. 9(a).

B. Sources of background

Detected α particles might originate from a source
other than elastic scattering of 30S with the helium nu-
clei in the target gas. We applied software gates to the
PPAC data event-by-event to ensure the incident beam
ions were consistent with the properties of 30S, which re-
moved contributions to the α spectrum induced by other
heavy ion species within the cocktail beam.

One might imagine various reactions with the PPACs,
Kapton window (stoichiometry C22H10N2O5), or the
CO2 used as a quenching gas in the active target. The
standard PPACs used at CRIB are each ﬁlled with 9 Torr
C3F8 over a length of ≈ 35 mm (≈ 0.3 mg cm−2) con-
ﬁned with 2 µm aluminized Mylar windows (H8C10O4)
and interspaced with a further three 1.5-µm similar foils
(8.5 µm in total).

The 30S beam proﬁle on PPACa does not have a line
of sight to the high-gain GEM owing to the active tar-
get entrance window combined with the bridge over the
downstream high-gain GEM, although the edge of the 30S
proﬁle on PPACb does have such a line of sight. Thus,
we can geometrically rule out PPACa (but not PPACb)
as a source of background α particles.

Although the CNO-group elements require some con-
sideration, we can immediately rule out hydrogen as a
background source of α particles, because the 30S(p, α)
reaction Q value is −8.47 MeV, and the 30S+p system
Ec.m. < 4 MeV anywhere after the dispersive focal plane.
As for the entrance window and quenching gas, the
Coulomb barriers for 30S+12C, 30S+14N, and 30S+16O
are 24.4, 28.0, and 31.3 MeV, respectively. The 30S
beam energy impinging on the Kapton window is about
2.34 MeV/u, yielding Ec.m. = 20.0, 22.3, 24.3 MeV for
nuclear interactions with 12C, 14N, and 16O, respec-
tively. As for the incident 30S beam energy impinging on
the He+CO2 gas, it is about 1.62 MeV/u, which yields
Ec.m. = 13.9, 16.9 MeV for nuclear interactions with 12C
and 16O, respectively. Considering that the center-of-
mass energies are always below the respective Coulomb
barriers for the entrance window and quenching gas, this
implies that the heavy-ion fusion cross sections should
be many orders of magnitude lower than that of α elastic
scattering.

Although we are not aware of any experimental data
concerning 30S-induced heavy-ion reactions, the fusion
study with 12C and 16O on the stable isotopes 28,29,30Si
by Jordan et al.
[53] is analogous if we accept isospin
symmetry. Their center-of-mass energies broadly over-
lap with ours suﬃciently to make a germane comparison.

FIG. 7. Residual light ion energy as measured by the SSD in
channels on the abscissa against the system ToF in nanosec-
onds on the ordinate. Signiﬁcant α background is seen around
channel 1000 in the SSD energy. The locus of true elastic scat-
tering events selected by the kinematic solution fall within the
depicted gate; however, it can be observed that one locus of
the beamlike α particles overlaps with the region of the true
events. See the text.

In that work, the authors see smooth behavior of the ex-
citation functions except in the case of 12C+28Si, where
they report oscillatory behavior between 21 ∼ 26 MeV
in 12C bombarding energies, which would correspond to
maximum Eα in the range of 5.5 ∼ 7 MeV from the
28Si(12C, 4He) reaction. Eα corresponding to the lowest
region of interest in our study of 30S+α is around 15 MeV
(Ec.m. ≈ 4 MeV). Thus, the only structure seen by Jor-
dan et al. is quite far away from the structure we report
here.

As relevant to the present study, Jordan et al. impor-
tantly ﬁnd smooth cross sections for 12C and 16O with
30Si, the mirror nucleus of 30S. Such behavior implies
that a background source of α particles in the present
work induced by CNO-group elements should have a rela-
tively ﬂat energy distribution. Figure 9(a) shows that our
observed resonant structure is manifested as destructive
interference with pure Rutherford scattering. It means
that any unaccounted for background of α particles aris-
ing from the 30S beam interacting with CNO-group el-
ements would tend to decrease our observed resonance
dips and thus our deduced partial widths Γi could be
modestly smaller than the true values. If we consider the
relative diﬀerences in the maximum (≈ 60 mb/sr) and
minimum (≈ 5 mb/sr) diﬀerential cross sections around
5 MeV center-of-mass energy, then a smooth background
cannot comprise more than 8% of the measurement in
the region of interest. This uncertainty turns out to be
smaller than the statistical error and as such can be rea-
sonably neglected.

The main sources of energy-dependent background
could be α particles originating from the RIB production
target satisfying the Bρ selection as well as contributions
from inelastic scattering. The bumps seen in the excita-
tion function around 3.5 MeV in Fig. 9(a) correspond

7

to the region where α particles magnetically selected by
CRIB are expected to appear. These background ions
are observed clearly in the spectrum of the SSD residual
energy against the system time of ﬂight (ToF) in Fig. 7.
The ToF is the time between PPACa and the SSD, fol-
lowing Ref. [54]. The ﬁgure shows all SSD events gated
on incoming 30S ions, about ≈ 80% of which are dis-
carded by the requirements of the kinematic solution.
The true elastic scattering events fall within a small lo-
cus on the histogram with a speciﬁc ToF, depicted by a
narrow gate. Conversely, the beamlike α particles span
the entire ToF range with temporal spacing exactly cor-
responding to the inverse of the cyclotron radiofrequency
signal, because these ions do not deposit enough energy
to trigger the PPAC and merely arrive at the SSD in
chance coincidence with a 30S ion at the PPAC. Ordi-
narily, the relation of the PPAC signal and cyclotron ra-
diofrequency corresponds to a relative ﬂight time of a
beam ion within the cocktail beam (see Fig. 4), but this
relation does not hold for such a chance coincidence. Al-
though most of such events are easily discarded, there is
a small region of overlap where the beamlike α particles
may contribute as much as 20% of the data in this region.
There is another particle group to the left of the α
background in Fig. 7 which is quite unusual, as its resid-
ual energy is positively correlated with its system ﬂight
time. The nature of this locus is not certain but is most
likely associated with light ejecta resulting from heavy
ions striking the Wien ﬁlter electrodes in chance coinci-
dence with a 30S beam ion. Considering the number of
events in this locus per ns, we estimate it may contribute
5% of the data in Fig. 9(a) near 3.3 MeV.

As described below in Sec. III D, introducing individ-
ual resonances in this region with widths equal to the
theoretical limit made no discernible change to the cal-
culated excitation function given our energy resolution.
Changing the ﬁll-gas to perform background measure-
ments with an active target necessitates adjusting the
GEM high voltage settings (which would still not guar-
antee identical operating conditions) as well as replica-
tion of all tuning and calibration measurements, which
requires a signiﬁcantly larger investment of time com-
pared to changing the target gas in an ordinary target.
Although we prepared to make such a measurement with
an Ar+CO2 gas mixture (as in our previous measure-
ments, e.g., [46]), unfortunately we did not have enough
time. Using the Wien ﬁlter to steer the beam, we deter-
mined that a vast majority of the beamlike α particles
are conﬁned to a narrow energy region.

Further analysis of Fig. 7 also sheds some light on the
origin of the scaling factor of 2 applied to obtain the cor-
rect magnitude of the absolute value of the elastic scat-
tering diﬀerential cross section. As stated above, about
20% of the events fall within a narrow locus and are con-
sistent with bona ﬁde elastic scattering events according
to the kinematic solution algorithm. More than three
times this many events (∼ 60% of the entire spectrum)
fall within the depicted gate, but over 70% of the events

mass energy in keV. The range of angles measured in the
laboratory frame is roughly 10◦ ≤ ϑlab ≤ 20◦ as 2ϑlab +
ϑc.m. = 180◦.

C. Experimental error

8

A number of diﬀerent factors can inﬂuence the deter-
mination of the center-of-mass energy Ec.m. for a given
event: the spread in the beam energy from the momen-
tum selection as well as straggling, the SSD resolution for
measurement of the α particle residual energy, the strag-
gling of the α particle, and the position determinations
of both the recoiling α and beam ion. However, since we
use the geometric measurements to determine ϑlab and
the residual energy of the outgoing α particle to deduce
Eα, these have the most profound eﬀect on the determi-
nation of Ec.m.. Based on Eq. (3), the uncertainty in the
center-of-mass energy ∆Ec.m. can be expressed as

where ∆Eα is the uncertainty in the measured α-particle
energy, ϑlab is the average measured angle, and the un-
certainty in the measured angle is ∆ϑlab = |ϑlab − ϑ′
lab|.
In the following illustrative calculations, Ec.m. was varied
in 1 MeV increments over the range of 2–6 MeV.

within this gate have no corresponding high-gain GEM
data (> 40% of the entire spectrum), thus ϑlab is un-
known and Eq. ??eq:kinematics) cannot be solved. The
solid angle of the right side of the downstream high-gain
GEM is about 50% that of the SSD, and the Rutherford
cross section is known to go as (sin4 θ
2 )−1, indicating it
does not change appreciably over a small change (≈ 10◦)
in ϑlab. This implies that about 1
2 of the events in the
ToF-E locus of Fig. 7 should be in coincidence with the
high-gain GEM, but only about 1
4 actually have high-
gain GEM data. These results are quite consistent with
our scaling factor of 2.

As for possible contributions from inelastic scatter-
ing, the ﬁrst excited state of 30S is relatively high at
E1x = 2.21 MeV and with a spin-parity of 2+. The in-
creased scattering threshold as well as the requirement
for ℓ ≥ 2 from the angular momentum selection rules in-
dicates that the widths, which decrease with increasing
ℓ, suggest a signiﬁcantly lower cross section than elas-
tic scattering. For example, in other studies of α elastic
scattering, this contribution was found to be less than
10% [43, 46], where the ﬁrst excited states are much
lower in energy. Moreover, as the resonances we ana-
lyzed were in the region of 4.0 ≤ Ec.m. ≤ 5.6 MeV, con-
tributions from inelastic scattering would show up near
1.8 ≤ Ec.m. ≤ 3.4 MeV in the elastic spectrum, where res-
onances were neither resolved nor analyzed in our data.
Therefore, it is reasonable to neglect any possible con-
tribution from inelastic scattering in the present analy-
sis; thus, we assume the total width can be expressed as
Γ = Γα0 + Γp.

Under the experimental conditions, the energy resolu-
tion of the SSD for 4.78-, 5.48-, and 5.795-MeV α par-
ticles from a standard source was 103, 98, and 87 keV,
respectively. For higher energy α particles, we assumed
the resolution of 1.5% as measured for the 5.795-MeV
α particles, which should be an overestimate. In an of-
ﬂine test, the SSD resolution for the 5.48-MeV line was
as good as 29 keV under vacuum which broadened to
70 keV when the chamber was ﬁlled with He+CO2 gas;
by folding an assumed 64 keV of broadening from energy
straggling with the intrinsic SSD resolution, we were able
to reproduce the measured width. Considering the posi-
tion of the α source was nearly 40 cm from the SSD in
oﬄine tests and α particles scattered at an initial labo-
ratory energy of 5.5 MeV would be nearly twice as close
to the SSD, 64 keV can be considered the maximum un-
certainty for straggling, with higher energy α particles
straggling much less as well as originating much closer
to the detectors. We ﬁnally adopted values for ∆Eα by
adding the above SSD resolution and the assumed strag-
gling in quadrature, except for the highest energy α par-
ticles where we simply adopted an uncertainty of 1.5%
since summing the overestimated uncertainties from both
resolution and straggling eﬀects is unreasonable.

In order to estimate the uncertainty in ϑlab arising
from the experimental determination of the scattering
position, we need to ﬁrst estimate the average ϑlab as a
function of Ec.m.. We plotted both the laboratory scat-
tering angle ϑlab and the center-of-mass angle ϑc.m. event
by event in order to determine their average values as
functions of the center-of-mass energy; the average ϑc.m.
is shown in Fig. 8. While the precision of each PPAC
to determine a beam particle’s position is 0.9 mm in
both X and Y , the position resolution becomes 4 mm

in both dimensions when extrapolated to a typical scat-
tering depth. The resolution achieved for the α particle’s
position with the backgammon pads was 3 mm in X and
0.5 mm in Y . All these uncertainties were added together
in quadrature to yield a ﬁnal uncertainty of 6.4 mm in
the determination of ϑlab. A new angle ϑ′
lab was calcu-
lated by shifting the position of the α particle by the
above 6.4 mm, assuming a standard scattering depth Z
representative of each of the ﬁve center-of-mass energies.
The resulting range of ∆ϑlab was found to be 1.3–2.1◦,
increasing with decreasing Ec.m..

Finally, we obtained an estimate for the uncertainty of
the center-of-mass energy of about 60–100 keV as shown
in Fig. 8; the intrinsic resolution of the SSD had the
predominant eﬀect, which was more pronounced at the
higher energies. Thus, it can be seen that the energy
binning choice of 100 keV is consistent with our achieved
resolution.

We conﬁrmed with a simple calculation that the above
geometric uncertainties dominate over the uncertainty in
the beam energy. Suppose we have two identical mea-
surements, but we know that the incident energy diﬀers
between the two beam ions. The result of the kinematic
solution is that the optimized scattering depth will be
larger for the higher energy beam ion and vice versa for
the low energy beam ion, because it is the scattering
depth combined with the incident beam energy together
that ﬁnally determines Ec.m.. Assuming a nominal scat-
tering energy of Ec.m. = 4.0 MeV, changing the trans-
verse scattering position by the 6.4 mm uncertainty men-
tioned above is equivalent to ∆ϑlab = 1.7◦, changing the
scattering depth ∆Z by 27 mm, or changing the beam
energy by 5.6 MeV. Thus, the uncertainties of these mea-
surements dominate over the intrinsic spread in the beam
energy of 2.0 MeV.

D. R-Matrix analysis

To extract the resonance parameters of interest, we
performed a multilevel, multichannel R-Matrix calcula-
tion [55] with the sammy8 code [56]. Succinctly, the R-
Matrix method calculates the interference between the
regular and irregular Coulomb functions with physical
resonances. The resonances are parameterized by their

9

energy Er (the same as Ec.m. from elastic scattering as
Q = 0), channel i partial widths Γi, and the angular mo-
menta transfer ℓi. The resonance shape is determined by
the entrance channel ℓα, the resonance height from the
entrance channel Γα, and the resonance width depends
on total width Γ. The total width is a sum of the pro-
ton and α partial widths, as both channels are open; the
gamma partial widths Γγ are negligibly small for these
highly excited, particle-unbound states. For the case of
30S+α elastic scattering, the situation is simpliﬁed for
the entrance channel, as both the nuclei have a ground-
state spin-parity J π = 0+, and so the quantum selection
rules dictate a unique resonance J π for each ℓα value—
namely that J = ℓα and the parity is always natural for
populated states in 34Ar.

The calculated excitation function was broadened
based on the experimental energy resolution and per-
formed at an average angle of ϑc.m. = 150◦ as evaluated
above in Sec. III C. We quantiﬁed the quality of a ﬁt by
ν, which is the chi-square χ2 di-
the reduced chi-square χ2
vided by the number of degrees of freedom ν. Fitting the
data with pure Coulomb scattering resulted in χ2
ν = 4.17
with 35 degrees of freedom, indicating the possibility for
signiﬁcant improvement could be expected by including
the interference eﬀect of resonances in an R-Matrix ﬁt.
As there are no known levels in 34Ar with Eex > 11 MeV,
we had to carefully introduce new resonances until the ex-
perimental data were reasonably reproduced. The max-
imum width of a resonance can be estimated with the
Wigner limit [57] as

WΓi =

2¯h2
µiR2
i

Pℓi ,

(6)

where µ is the channel reduced mass, R is the channel ra-
dius, and Pℓ is the channel penetrability, respectively, for
channel i. We calculate the penetrability as Pℓ = ρ
,
F 2
ℓ +G2
ℓ
where ρ = kR
¯h includes the phase space factor k, and Fℓ
and Gℓ are the regular and irregular Coulomb functions,
respectively. Such a physical constraint is particularly
relevant when introducing new resonances to help limit
the parameter space. We adopted the channel radius
given by Ri = 1.45(A1/3
1 + A1/3
) fm, where A1 and A2
are the mass numbers of the two species in channel i;
an identical parametrization was used in the studies of
21Na+α [58] and 26Si+p [44], which are two of the most
similar experiments to the present work. For consistency,
the same α-channel radius was also used in the R-Matrix
calculation.

2

At the outset, we began with a single channel (Γ =
Γα), single level manual analysis starting with the lowest-
energy features and slowly moving to higher excitation
energies in discrete steps of 100 keV. The width was set
to the Wigner limit (Γα = WΓα ) to determine which fea-
tures could be resolved by assuming the existence of a
physical resonance. At this time we also checked pos-
sible values of the angular momentum transfer ℓα; al-
though the experimental setup allowed for values of up to

particles can no longer reach the detector from stopping in the ﬁll gas. The bumps observed around 3.5 MeV correspond to a

parameters of these three newly discovered resonances are shown in Table II. (b) All physically allowed ℓα values for the

corresponding widths. The 12.08-MeV level is shown in italic letters as there is a large systematic uncertainty associated with
it. See the text.

ℓα = 6, ℓα ≥ 5 never gave good ﬁts, since resonances with
these higher transfers are essentially not visible within
the present resolution. Only under this condition where
Γp = 0 and Γα was at the Wigner limit was it possi-
ble to observe a change of any kind in the calculation
for Ec.m. ≤ 3.8 MeV, and even so the calculated devia-
tion from pure Coulomb scattering was of a smaller mag-
nitude than the experimental uncertainty, particularly
near 3.5 MeV. The calculations were consistent with our
interpretation that the ﬂuctuations below 3.8 MeV are
statistical or background induced. The subsequent mul-
tilevel, multichannel analysis thus focuses on the region
of 3.9–5.6 MeV and assumes ℓα ≤ 4; three resonancelike
structures could be resolved near Ec.m. ≈ 4.35, 4.78, and
5.34 MeV. Although resonances observed by transfer re-
actions always appear as peaks in the diﬀerential cross
section, in the case of elastic scattering the interference
pattern caused by a resonance can be observed as a dip-
like structure rather than as a peak, particularly below
the Coulomb barrier.

For the proton channel, we assumed the lowest ℓp al-
lowed would have the predominant contribution. The

spin of the proton s1 = 1
2 and the spin of the 33Cl ground
state s2 = 3
2 , which can align (↑↑) or anti-align (↑↓) to
give the total spin s = s1 ⊕ s2, and the same is true for
the resulting spin s coupling with ℓp to sum J = ℓp ⊕ s.
An example of the lowest-ℓp coupling schemes are shown
in Table I for up to 4+ natural-parity states in 34Ar.

For convenience, we introduced the dimensionless re-
duced partial width θ2
i = Γi/WΓi, in order to easily en-
sure that, regardless of ℓ, θ2
i ≤ 1. Resonant elastic scat-
tering is often analyzed by a single-channel formalism
because the resonance shape and height are not aﬀected
by the other channels; thus at the outset we simpliﬁed
our model by controlling the proton width via a uni-
versal ratio of the dimensionless reduced partial widths
ξ ≡ θ2
α, which was found to be 3% in a similar work
[58]. Although the value of Γp derived this way may
have a large uncertainty as well as model dependence, it
is physically unrealistic to perform a single-channel anal-
ysis so far above the proton threshold.

Starting with the ﬁrst resonance near 4.35 MeV and
truncating the excitation function towards higher ener-
gies, a computer code optimized Er, ℓ, θ2
α, and ξ, un-

 
 
til all three resonances were introduced and the ﬁt took
into account the entire energy range of the experimen-
tal excitation function. Once we had such a reasonable
ﬁt (ξ ≈ 4%), we then allowed θ2
p to vary individually
for each resonance and again covaried sets of resonance
parameters to search for the best ﬁt for the entire spec-
trum. In summary, Er was covaried over 200 keV in 1 keV

was covaried in 1% steps up to > 99%, and θ2
p was var-
ied in small increments up to 10% (past where ξ showed
poor behavior) in our search for the best ﬁt, shown in
Fig. 9(a), where the horizontal errors are from the 100-
keV binning and the vertical errors are purely statistical;
the absolute magnitude of the statistical error was scaled
by the same factor of 2.0 as the data. All possible ℓ val-
ues for the 4.78-MeV state are shown in Fig. 9(b) for
illustrative purposes.

A number of systematic uncertainties that might aﬀect
the diﬀerential cross section were carefully considered.
These include contributions to each of the parameters in
Eq. ??eq:dsigma-domega), namely the number density of
helium atoms n, the stopping power of the beam S(Eb),
the number of injected beam ions Ib, and the changing
solid angle ∆Ω. The number density of 4He atoms in
the target employed cannot be changed by any physi-
cal argument, since the pressure gauge in the gas ﬂow
controller described in Sec. II was consistent with two
other pressure gauges. The gas density calculated from
the nominal laboratory conditions with the ideal gas law
is consistent with the density utilized in all energy loss
calculations. Any error in the density of helium would
apply equally to CO2 which induced signiﬁcant energy
loss for the heavy ions. Such energy loss calculations are
generally known to be accurate to the order of 10% or
better, and moreover we experimentally veriﬁed the stop-
ping position and Bragg curve of 30S in the target gas.
Although we initially assumed the energy distribution of
the 30S ions should be gaussian, we found the centroid
was skewed to the low energy side by 1%; calculating the
30S ion incident energy event-by-event based on the rf
data rather than assuming a gaussian distribution did not
result in any noticeable diﬀerence in the elastic scattering
excitation function. The number of incident 30S ions is
determined in part by the PPAC scalers, the magnitude
of which can be conﬁrmed as we recorded a downscaled
spectrum of the cocktail beam; although the latter is less
accurate, the two methods agreed within 6%. We checked
the method of calculating the solid angle, as well as the
absolute eﬃciency of the silicon detectors, considering
the known intensity of the standard α source used in
oﬀ-line calibration runs; within the errors of these calcu-
lations, we found the eﬃciency η > 99% for the relevant
silicon detectors before and after the experimental run,
indicating the detectors were not damaged during the ex-
periment. As the scaling factor of 2.0 ± 0.1 is the main
source of systematic error, we take its associated uncer-
tainty of 5% as the systematic uncertainty in the present
work. Because the statistical error is ≥ 25% over the

11

resonant-dominated region, the systematic error makes a
negligible contribution to the ﬁnal error evaluation.

The resonance parameters deduced from the R-Matrix
analysis are shown in Table II. The uncertainties in the
adopted level parameters were calculated in the follow-
ing ways. For the excitation energy Eex, we used the
experimental energy resolution as discussed in Sec. III C
and shown in Fig. 8. The error of the remaining level
parameters was evaluated considering the range where
an individual parameter is allowed to vary within one
standard deviation of the best ﬁt χ2
ν; the same method
was used over the range of Ec.m. 1.9–4.1 MeV with pure
Rutherford scattering to determine the scaling factor and
its error of 2.0 ± 0.1. The recommended spin parity J π
is given, and any other spin-parity which is possible is
listed, as are the associated widths in their respective
columns separated by commas. The error in Γp is seen
to be generally larger than in Γα, because the α elastic
scattering resonant structure is much less sensitive to the
proton channel compared to the α channel.

The resonance parameters obtained in the present
study appear to be reasonable except for the widths
for the 12.08-MeV state.
In particular, the 12.08-MeV
state’s structure cannot be a pure α cluster which also has
a non-negligible proton decay branch. Our favored inter-
pretation is that there are one or more unresolved res-
onances with substantial α-cluster conﬁguration in this
region. Moreover, the behavior of the resonance tail is
unconstrained by the data, and any interference eﬀects
from unknown physical resonances outside the energy
range cannot be accounted for. Thus, there are large sys-
tematic uncertainties associated with the resonance pa-
rameters extracted from an R-Matrix ﬁt for states near
the boundary of the experimental energy range. How-
ever, it cannot be doubted that the data indicate one or
more very strong α-cluster resonance(s) in this region of
excitation energy, which is a point we emphasize in our
discussion of these results below.

IV. DISCUSSION

We observed the signature interference patterns of sev-
eral resonances in 34Ar with large α partial widths Γα
via α elastic scattering on 30S. The cluster threshold rule
predicts the existence of these states, which have a large
overlap of the cluster conﬁguration to the nuclear wave-
function nearby the respective cluster’s separation energy
[59, 60]. Such α-cluster resonances have typically domi-
nated the stellar rate of exothermic (α, n) and (α, p) re-
actions on Tz = ±1 nuclei, respectively, when they fall
within the astrophysical Gamow burning window [61].
α resonant elastic scattering has long been known as a
powerful tool to selectively observe states with large Γα.
The eﬀect is especially pronounced in inverse kinematics,
where measurements at large backward angles are possi-
ble and the nonresonant cross sections are minimized;
under these conditions, one expects to observe states

TABLE III. Resonance parameters of 34Ar adopted in the calculation of the 30S(α, p) stellar reaction rate calculation. Reso-
nances with Er < 0.7 MeV are not tabulated as they fall below the x-ray burst Gamow window and the Wigner limit for the α
channel rapidly vanishes. Parameters shown in boldface are based on experimental data. Level energies below Eex < 11 MeV
are taken from Ref. [31], where we assumed J π = 0+ and Γα = 1
2 WΓα = γ; the relative dependence of J and γ for small J in
our framework is exempliﬁed in Fig. 10. The higher energy resonances are from the present work and are separated from the
others by a horizontal rule. We stress that the tabulated properties which are not taken from experimental data may not be
correct for individual resonances, but rather that the sum of these contributions to the stellar reaction rate can be considered
an upper limit under an extreme assumption, which is interesting to investigate. See the text.

with Γα comparable to the experimental energy resolu-
tion [33]. According to calculations of the Wigner limit
(6)], the maximum theoretical width shrinks
[see Eq.
rapidly as the energy is reduced towards the threshold.

Our observation that all three resonances are consis-
tent with a 2+ assignment may make one wonder if there
is a reason for such behavior. These may be regarded
as a triplet if the tentative assignments of 2+ are correct
for both the 11.09- and 12.08-MeV states. Alternatively,
our 11.51-MeV state could be regarded as a 2+ doublet
paired with either these other two states. We note that
all three are observed as diplike structures, so it may not
be surprising that features in the diﬀerential cross sec-
tion with similar interference patterns can result from
physical resonances with the same J π. A system of α-
cluster doublets was observed in the Tz = +1 nucleus
22Ne [62, 63] with J π correlated with increasing energy,
albeit for states of negative rather than positive parity.
Unfortunately, comparison with model predictions is still
a challenge for the 30S mass region.

A. Reaction rate

The peak temperature of x-ray bursts is expected to be
in the range of 1.3–2 GK corresponding to the Gamow
burning windows of 1.7 <
∼ 3.8 MeV. To make
a meaningful evaluation of the stellar reaction rate in

∼ Ec.m. <

XRBs, we therefore need to consider not only the res-
onances discovered in the present work, but also 34Ar
states at lower Eex.
In fact, before the present work
there has never been an evaluation of the 30S(α, p) cross
section based on experimental level structure of 34Ar ow-

ing to the paucity of such data and the experimental
challenges of studies in this region of the periodic table.
The 36Ar(p, t)34Ar measurement performed at the Re-
search Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka Uni-
versity observed resonances above the α threshold at
a relatively smooth interval—about four resonances per
MeV—over four MeV in excitation energy [31]. Consid-
ering the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in energy resolution, our
observation of three (or four, depending on the interpre-
tation of our 12.08 MeV state) resonances per MeV over
the range of our experimental energy and as the resolu-
tion allows, there is a basic consistency between the two
studies, which both only populate natural-parity states.2
However, the results from the RCNP spectroscopic
study only provides us with preliminary resonance ener-
gies, and some assumptions are required before we may
apply them. Firstly, we na¨ıvely assumed that each state
has J π = 0+. As for the partial widths, based on the
present results and the similar level density between the
two studies, we set Γα = 1
α are
generally larger than 0.5 according to Table II, setting
θ2
α ≈ 1 for such a large series of resonances would be
unusual considering Γp 6= 0 and thus Γ > Γα and hence
θ2
α < 1. We believe a factor of 0.5 is still rather extreme
but more reasonable.

2 WΓα . Although our θ2

It should be noted a thorough analysis of the RCNP
experimental data would only improve the situation with
regard to the precision of the excitation energies (or the
removal of any states which are background induced) and
not the spin-parities nor the partial widths. The lim-
ited angular distribution available from their spectrom-
eter does not cover a full phase for reliable comparison
with a DWBA calculation [65, 66].

We calculated the resonant reaction rate per particle
pair hσvi using the standard formulation [57] which de-
pends only on the resonance energies Er, spins J, and
the channel partial widths Γi. The spin comes into play
in the spin statistical factor ω as:

where JA,a, the spins of the two nuclei in the entrance

from 1–10 GK. The statistical model (SM) rate from non-
smoker [67] is shown as the long-dashed black line, to which
all the rates are normalized. The dashed grey lines represent
our new higher-energy resonances observed at CRIB with our
best ﬁt quantum properties. The dotted (blue) lines represent
the 13 resonances from the 36Ar(p, t) RCNP experiment [31],

strength as it is proportional to the integral of the res-
onance cross section. We also use the standard simpliﬁ-
cation that γ = (ΓαΓp)/(Γα + Γp) ≈ Γα when Γα ≪ Γp,
which is a realistic assumption considering the vastly dif-
ferent Wigner limits of the two channels.3 The resulting
ωγ for each resonance in the 36Ar(p, t) study based on
our assumptions that J = 0 and γ = Γα = 1
2 WΓα varies
by only a factor of around two for J ≤ 3 (although it
quickly drops oﬀ for J ≥ 5) as shown in Fig 10, vindi-
cating our arbitrary treatment of the spin in our frame-
work; ωγ is independent of low J to ﬁrst order because we
parametrize the width based on the Wigner limit, which
decreases with increasing J, whereas for the 30S+α en-
trance channel ω = 2Jr + 1. While the properties of an
individual resonance calculated in this manner will be
unreliable, the sum of these contributions can be consid-
ered an upper limit under extreme assumptions on the
nuclear structure of 34Ar.

Our goal here is to provide an evaluation of the
30S(α, p) reaction rate in x-ray bursts by assuming broad
widths for all the known states in 34Ar near the astro-
physically interesting region. According to Fig. 10, the

2 While a single step (p, t) transfer reaction can only populate
natural-parity states, a multistep process allows for the popula-
tion of unnatural-parity states (see, e.g., Ref. [64]). However, the
cross section to populate unnatural-parity states by a multistep
process is signiﬁcantly smaller than the cross section for a single
step process as a general rule.

3 According to our data from Table II, the best ﬁt Γp and Γα are of
comparable size. However, we note that the upper-limit errors
for Γp are extremely large, which is not inconsistent with the
assumption that γ ≈ Γα. Even in the case that Γα = Γp, γ =
1
2 Γα, giving a similar factor of 2 error to ωγ as the assumption
of J = 0 as shown presently.

 
 
 
choice of J π = 0+ yields a median value of the reso-
nance strength for low J in our model and thus represents
the physically realistic case where there are a multitude
of diﬀerent spins among the levels in 34Ar over the al-
pha threshold.
It can be seen in the case of J = 3 or
higher that the reaction rate could be half or less than
our suggested upper limit. To demonstrate, we consid-
ered the case when γ = Γα = 2WΓα and J π = 4+; be-
tween T = 1and3 GK the reaction rate is a factor of 2
lower than our evaluation in spite of the fact that the re-
duced width was twice rather than half the Wigner limit.
This feature of the Wigner limit is satisfyingly consistent
with the fact that resonant thermonuclear reaction rates
tend to be dominated by lower partial wave contributions
because the angular momentum barrier is smaller. Im-
portantly, the rate only exceeds our evaluation by 0.2%
at T = 1.5 GK if we allow the maximum Γα from our
experimental uncertainties in Table II, which we consider
to be a trivial diﬀerence.

The 34Ar resonance parameters adopted for our
30S(α, p) stellar reaction rate calculation are listed in Ta-
ble III along with calculations of the proton and α Wigner
limits. We used the graph digitizing system gsys from
the Hokkaido University Nuclear Reaction Data Centre,
which was developed speciﬁcally for extracting numerical
nuclear data from published spectra, to obtain the res-
onance energies from the 36Ar(p, t) study [31]. For the
known resonances, we found deviations from the com-
piled level scheme [68] of at most around 30 keV, which is
the same as the experimental error quoted by O’Brien et
al. The resulting stellar reaction rate is shown in Fig. 11
in comparison to a statistical model (SM) rate [67]. As
this is the ﬁrst 30S(α, p) reaction rate based on the exper-
imental level structure of 34Ar, there are not many other
studies to compare ours against. The two most relevant
studies are the 33Cl(p, α) measurement [32] and a recent
survey of α-induced cross sections for masses A ≈ 20–50
[69].

In order to compare the present results with the time-
reversal study by Deibel et al.
[32], one should keep in
mind that the 30S(α, p) Q value is 2.080 MeV, and thus
their energy range in 30S+α is 4.09 ≤ Ec.m. ≤ 5.35 MeV
(as shown in their Table I), quite similar to the range of
resonances observed in the present work. The previous
study includes only the (α, p0) ground-state component,
whereas the present Γp does not exclude the summed con-
tribution from all states where the assumption Γα ≪ Γpi
remains valid for at least one pi; the SM rate implicitly
includes transitions to allowed states. The present work
shows an enhancement of around a factor of 5 over the
SM rate as an upper limit, and the work of Deibel et al.
shows a 30S(α0, p0) cross section which is more compara-
ble to the SM rate and is considered as a lower limit to
the total (α, p) cross section. Even if one only includes
the resonances we observed at CRIB, it can be seen that
near 3 GK our three resonances alone are quite similar
to the SM rate.

shows a global behavior of the cross sections for (α, p)
and (α, n) reactions over a large energy range for medium
mass nuclei [69]. Speciﬁcally, most of the experimental
data can be reproduced by a SM calculation. However,
deviations higher than the expected cross sections were
found in some of the measurements with 23Na and 33S,
whereas the species 36Ar and 40Ar were seen to be much
lower (at least for the available data). For the case of
23Na, the work of Mohr motivated the community to re-
investigate the 23Na(α, p) cross-section, which was ﬁnally
found to be consistent with the SM calculation within the
experimental uncertainties [70–73].
In the outstanding
cases, these discrepancies certainly warrant further in-
vestigation to determine if they are real or artiﬁcial (see
also the discussion in the recent work by Anderson et al.
[74]). If the eﬀects are real, 30S is seen to fall within the
mass range where there is a cross section enhancement
over the SM, which supports the ﬁndings of the present
study.

B. Astrophysical implications

The impact of our new upper limit for the 30S(α, p)33Cl
rate was examined within the framework of one-zone
XRB postprocessing calculations using the K04 (Tpeak =
1.4 GK) model [13]. As shown in Fig. 12, striking dif-
ferences in the proﬁles of nuclear energy generation rates
between approximately 1 and 10 s are seen when com-
paring XRB calculations using the present upper limit
and a statistical model rate calculation [67] (see Fig. 11).
Indeed, Egen diﬀers by as much as 25% between calcula-
tions using these two rates. Nucleosynthesis predictions
are also aﬀected by the particular 30S(α, p) rate adopted
in the calculations. Comparing results using the present
upper limit and the statistical model rate, abundance dif-
ferences of up to 30% are observed for species with mass
fractions > 10−6 (summed over mass number), for A over
the rather broad range of approximately 20–80. Further

 
 
 
tests using full hydrodynamic XRB models are needed
to explore in detail the possible dramatic impact of the
30S(α, p)33Cl rate on predictions of XRB observables.

V. SUMMARY

We observed several resonances with large α widths in
the energy range Eex = 11.1–12.1 MeV for the ﬁrst time
in 34Ar via the α resonant elastic scattering of 30S and
determined their properties of spin, parity and widths.
Using our new data, we were able to make the ﬁrst-
ever calculation of the astrophysical 30S(α, p) cross sec-
tion based on the experimental level structure of 34Ar.
Although these resonances do not seem to have a large
eﬀect for the astrophysically interesting energies impor-
tant for XRBs, we could set a reasonable upper limit on
the stellar reaction rate of about one order of magnitude
greater than the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. The
resonances we observed correspond very well to the en-
ergy range covered in the time-reversal study. These two
studies complement each other nicely, as our work pro-
vides an upper limit to the cross section, which we de-
termined to be somewhat above the existing 33Cl(p0, α0)
lower limit to the total 30S(α, p) cross section. Although
the present knowledge of the level structure of 34Ar, as
well as the 30S(α, p) cross section, at the most astrophys-
ically interesting temperatures remains elusive, our new
upper limit can, for the ﬁrst time, conclusively rule out
the artiﬁcial cross section enhancement of a factor of a
hundred over the SM used in one XRB model [16]. This
can, in turn, rule out the inﬂuence of the 30S(α, p) reac-
tion in explaining such double-peaked burst morphology,
consistent with the theoretical ﬁndings of a recent study
[17].

From a technical perspective, we developed the highest
quality 30S radioactive ion beam for astrophysical studies
yet in the world. Our analysis also showed that active
target systems must be designed with extremely high pre-
cision capabilities and that reports of α scattering with
such systems must be viewed with scrutiny. However, the
active target system enabled us to understand the energy
loss properties of the beam very clearly, which is often a

15

challenge for experiments performed using a thick target
in inverse kinematics.

Further work is required to elucidate the behavior of
the 30S(α, p) stellar reaction rate over the energy ranges
applicable to XRBs so that its predicted inﬂuence on the
energy generation, compositional inertia, and burst light
curve can be reliably extracted from theoretical mod-
els. Of course, a direct measurement of the 30S(α, p)
reaction at the relevant energies would be the ideal ap-
proach, but it is unclear when a suﬃciently intense, low
energy 30S RIB will become available. An intensity like
104 pps is insuﬃcient, and it took us four years to de-
velop such an RIB for the present study.
Instead, the
community should continue to exploit indirect methods
as in the present study in the near future.
In particu-
lar, it is critical to obtain more experimental knowledge
of the quantum properties, particularly Γα, of states in
34Ar over Eex from 8.0 to 11.5 MeV.
