Abstract: Acoustic-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM) is a promising tool for microvascular imaging. 
In  the  focal  region,  resolution  of  AR-PAM  is  determined  by  the  ultrasound  transducer  and  ultimately  limited  by 
acoustic diffraction. In the out-of-focus region, resolution deteriorates with increasing distance from the focal plane, 
which restricts depth of focus (DOF). Besides, a trade-off exists between resolution and DOF. Previously, synthetic 
aperture  focusing  technique  (SAFT)  and/or  deconvolution  methods  have  been  demonstrated  to  enhance  AR-PAM 
images.  However,  they  suffer  from  issues  in  low  resolution,  low  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR),  and/or  poor  image 
fidelity.  Here,  we  propose  a  novel  algorithm  for  AR-PAM  to  enhance  image  resolution,  SNR,  and  fidelity.  The 
algorithm  consists  of  a  Fourier  accumulation  SAFT  (FA-SAFT)  and  a  directional  model-based  (D-MB) 
deconvolution  method.  Inspired  from  Fourier  denoising  technique  and  directional  SAFT,  FA-SAFT  mainly 
compensates for the defocusing effect. Besides, D-MB deconvolution enhances the resolution as well as preserves 
the image fidelity, especially for the objects with line patterns such as microvasculature. Full width at half maximum 
of 2631 m over DOF of 1.8 mm and minimum resolvable distance of 4649 m are experimentally achieved by 
imaging tungsten wire phantom. Moreover, imaging of leaf skeleton phantom and  in vivo imaging of mouse blood 
vessels also prove that our algorithm is capable of providing high-resolution, high-SNR, and good-fidelity results for 
complex structures and for in vivo applications. 

Keywords:  Photoacoustic  microscopy,  image  enhancement,  synthetic  aperture  focusing  technique,  directional 
algorithm, model-based deconvolution. 

1. Introduction 
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging (PAI) has developed rapidly in the past two decades. In PA image acquisition, an object 
is excited by a light source, and ultrasound (US) waves emerge because of the PA effect. Then, one can recover the 
light absorber distribution by collecting the US waves with an US transducer and using a reconstruction algorithm. 
PAI has achieved promising results in microvascular imaging [13] and endoscopic imaging [4], to name a few. PA 
microscopy (PAM) is one implementation of PAI and can be classified into optical-resolution PAM (OR-PAM) and 
acoustic-resolution  PAM  (AR-PAM),  depending  on  the  focusing  approach.  Overall,  OR-PAM  enjoys  high 
resolution but suffers from low imaging depth (~1 mm) while AR-PAM can achieve deep imaging depth by taking 
advantage of diffused light and good acoustic penetration [5].  

In AR-PAM, its lateral resolution depends on the center frequency and numerical aperture (NA) of  a focused 
US transducer. High lateral resolution requires that the transducer has high center frequency and high NA, which in 
turn  limit  penetration  and  depth  of  focus  (DOF)  of  AR-PAM.  The  former  is  because  high-frequency  US  waves 
attenuate dramatically in biological tissue, and the latter is because a high-NA transducer has limited DOF. Besides, 
the  ultimate  resolution  of  AR-PAM  is  restricted  by  acoustic  diffraction.  Fortunately,  previous  works  have 
demonstrated image enhancement in  lateral resolution, DOF, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using algorithms, 
which circumvents the issues associated with the high-frequency and high-NA transducer. 

Synthetic aperture focusing technique  (SAFT) is often used  in  AR-PAM  reconstruction  for enhancing lateral 
resolution in the out-of-focus region. SAFT was first developed for US imaging to realize beamforming [6] and then 
was applied to PAI based on  a point-like acoustic detector  [7]. Later, Li  et al. proposed the  virtual-point-detector 
(VPD) concept to apply SAFT to AR-PAM using a focused transducer [8]. Afterward, SAFT was extended to two 
dimensions by Deng et al. [9]. Considering the line pattern of blood vessels in AR-PAM images, adaptive SAFT (A-

 
 
 
 
 
 
SAFT)  was  further  investigated  [10].  To  improve  resolution  in  the  focal  region,  spatial-dependent  contributions 
were weighted using the spatial impulse response (SIR) in SAFT [11]. More recently, delay-multiply-and-sum-based 
SAFT [12], two-dimensional (2D) spherical SAFT (S-SAFT) [13], and directional SAFT (D-SAFT) [14] have been 
further  studied  to  improve  lateral  resolution  and  SNR  in  the  out-of-focus  region.  Lateral  resolution  in  the  out-of-
focus region can be effectively improved by SAFT but is still ultimately limited  to the in-focus  lateral resolution. 
Therefore, deconvolution-based algorithms are used to further improve lateral resolution in PAI [13,15,16] and US 
imaging [17,18]. Specifically, in AR-PAM, the point spread function (PSF) is dominated by the finite US detection 
beam size of a transducer. Deconvolution of acquired PA images with PSF could recover the raw PA distribution. 
Previously, Cai et al. [13,16] used Richardson-Lucy (R-L) deconvolution algorithm to improve the AR-PAM lateral 
and  axial  resolutions  in  both  the  focal  and  out-of-focus  regions.  However,  the  nature  of  the  line  pattern  of  blood 
vessels was not considered, and thus, the recovered lines suffer the discontinuity issue. An alternative model-based 
(MB)  deconvolution  method  assumes  the  acquired  PA  image  is  the  result  of  convolution  of  a  PA  source  (an 
absorber)  and  a  dictionary  matrix.  Then,  the  PA  source  distribution  could  be  recovered  by  using  an  optimization 
approach. It has been demonstrated that the MB deconvolution method can improve resolution in both PAI and US 
imaging  [1921].  Besides,  prior  knowledge  of  sparsity  was  considered  as  a  regularization  term  in  the  model  to 
further enhance the resolution [20,21]. As a matter of fact, the nature of the line pattern of blood vessels in AR-PAM 
images has only one-dimensional (1D) sparsity (in contrast to 2D sparsity in [20,21]). If it is not considered, results 
will have the discontinuity issue, as also encountered in the R-L deconvolution algorithm mentioned above.  

To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel two-step algorithm including a Fourier accumulation 
SAFT  (FA-SAFT)  and  a  directional  MB  (D-MB)  deconvolution  method  to  improve  resolution,  SNR,  and  image 
fidelity in both the focal and out-of-focus regions for AR-PAM [22]. Our contributions can be summarized in two 
aspects. (i) FA-SAFT uses a sharpening filter to improve the high-frequency components of PA images in Fourier 
domain  (k-space).  Such  a  sharpening  filter  is  adaptive  to  different  patterns  of  the  acquired  PA  images,  leading  to 
enhanced  resolution  and  SNR.  (ii)  D-MB  deconvolution  takes  1D  sparsity  of  the  line  pattern  into  account,  which 
further  enhances  resolution  and  keeps  image  fidelity.  The  results  by  our  algorithm  are  promising.  By  imaging 
tungsten  wires,  high  resolution  over  large  DOF  and  good  image  fidelity  are  experimentally  achieved  using  our 
algorithm. Further, in vivo imaging is also demonstrated to show the superior capability of our algorithm. Compared 
with  existing  algorithms  (D-SAFT,  R-L  deconvolution,  etc.),  our  algorithm  enables  great  imaging  performance  in 
resolution,  SNR,  and  fidelity  for  both  phantom  and  in  vivo  imaging  demonstrations.  The  effect  of  SNR  on  the 
performance of our algorithm is also investigated and discussed. 

2. Related Techniques 
We  first  describe  some  existing  techniques  related  to  our  algorithm.  The  conventional  SAFT  algorithms  are 
introduced in Sections 2.1. Then, adaptive-based SAFT algorithms including A-SAFT and D-SAFT are introduced 
in Sections 2.2. Finally, R-L deconvolution and MB deconvolution are introduced in Sections 2.3. 

2.1. Conventional SAFT 
In AR-PAM, linear scanning is conducted in one dimension or two dimensions. We first illustrate SAFT for the 1D 
case,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  In  SAFT,  signal  synthesis  is  performed  based  on  a  delay-and-sum  algorithm  along  the 
scanning line, which forms a synthetic aperture, and can be expressed as:       

N−1
RFSAFT(𝑡) = ∑ RF𝑖(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖),
𝑖=0

(1) 
where RFSAFT(𝑡) is the synthesized PA A-line signal after SAFT at a certain scanning position, RF𝑖(𝑡) is the signal 
acquired  at  the 𝑖th scanning  position,  and ∆𝑡𝑖 is  the  corresponding  time  delay  between  the  target RFSAFT(𝑡) at  that 
certain scanning position and RF𝑖(𝑡). That is, when ∆𝑡𝑖 = 0, the target RFSAFT(𝑡) signal and the RF𝑖(𝑡) signal are at 
the  same  scanning  position.  Since  AR-PAM  is  usually  implemented  with  a  focused  transducer  (Fig.  1b),  a  VPD 
concept was proposed, and the time delay is computed using the following equation [6], [11], [14]: 

∆𝑡𝑖 = 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝑧 − 𝑧𝑓) ∗

𝑟 − 𝑟′
𝑐

, 

(2) 
where  sgn  is  the  sign  function,  and 𝑧 and 𝑧𝑓  are  the  axial  distance  of RF𝑖(𝑡) and  the  focal  length  of  AR-PAM 
system, respectively. 𝑧 − 𝑧𝑓 is the out-of-focus distance (OFD). 𝑟 and 𝑟′ are the distance to the focal point from the 
target RFSAFT(𝑡) and from RF𝑖(𝑡), respectively. c is the speed of sound in a propagation medium.  

 
 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic of SAFT for (a) a point detector and (b) a focused transducer (VPD) in one dimension. Scanning is 
conducted along the X direction.    

Due  to  the  spatial  response  of  the  focused  transducer,  the  previous  study  further  proposed  improved  SAFT 
algorithm by incorporating SIR to weigh the spatial-dependent contributions of RF𝑖(𝑡) [11]. Eq. (1) is thus modified 
as: 

N−1

RFSAFT(𝑡) = ∑ RF𝑖(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖) ∗ SIR𝑖(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖).

(3) 
Furthermore, to suppress the out-of-phase summation in Eq. (1), coherence factor (CF) [7] is applied in SAFT 

𝑖=0

and is defined as: 

CF(𝑡) =

|∑
N ∑

|
(RF𝑖(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖) ∗ SIR𝑖(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖)

2

)2

(4) 

RFSAFT−CF(𝑡) = RFSAFT(𝑡) ∗  CF(𝑡). 

(5) 
1D SAFT can be extended to 2D SAFT by conducting the scanning in two dimensions. 2D cross SAFT (C-
SAFT) [9] and 2D S-SAFT [13] were proposed to extend the effective aperture size, which is discussed in detail in 
previous literature [9,13]. 

2.2. A-SAFT and D-SAFT 
AR-PAM is mostly used for vascular imaging. Considering the directional characteristic of the line pattern of blood 
vessels, A-SAFT and D-SAFT were proposed by Deng et al. [10] and Jeon et al. [14], respectively, aiming at SAFT 
for vascular images. A-SAFT is based on 1D SAFT with the signal synthesis directions adaptively changed with the 
directions of vessel line branches. However, the performance of A-SAFT depends on the successful recognition of 
the vessel branches’ directions before applying A-SAFT. In other words, if one branch is not observed or recovered 
properly before A-SAFT is applied, it will not be recovered properly after A-SAFT.  

To deal with this problem, D-SAFT was designed to recover vessel line branches in a directional way [14]. In 

D-SAFT, 1D SAFT along a series of directions is first applied, as described in the following equation: 

CF(𝑡) =

RFSAFT−CF,𝜃(𝑡) = ∑ RF𝑖,𝜃(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖) ∗ SIR𝑖(𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑖) ∗ CF(𝑡)

, 

(6) 

𝑖=0

(7) 
where θ indicates the synthesis directions, which lies in the lateral plane and means the direction along which the 1D 
SAFT  is  conducted.  For  a  specific  θ,  vessel  branches  perpendicular  to  the  θ  direction  can  be  well  recovered. 
Therefore, different branches  with diverse orientations can  be  recovered  with different  θ. Then, D-SAFT uses the 
hamming window in k-space to compose the results from all directions. Three-dimensional (3D) D-SAFT procedure 
can be described using the equations: 

K𝜃(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) = 𝐹{RFSAFT−CF,𝜃(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡)} 

(8) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
N′−1

Kmerged(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) = ∑ K𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔)

∗ W𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔), 

𝑛=0

(9) 
where  𝐹  represents  the  Fourier  transform,  K𝜃  represents  the  spectrum  of  RFSAFT−CF,𝜃 ,  and  𝑢, 𝑣  represents 
wavenumbers,  corresponding  to  the  coordinates  𝑥, 𝑦  in  the  lateral  plane,  respectively.  𝜔  represents  PA  signal 
frequency. N′ represents the number of directions for 1D SAFTs. W𝜃𝑛 is the weight for a specific direction 𝜃𝑛, and 
Kmerged is the combined results in  k-space. As discussed above,  for a  certain branch direction, only the synthesis 
direction  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  branch  direction  can  properly  recover  the  branch.  W𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) is  used  to 
weight the contribution of signal synthesis in different directions over the lateral plane in k-space (K𝜃(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔)) and 
thus  has  no  change  over  different  𝜔.  Therefore, W𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) degenerates  to W𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣),  which  is  expressed  as 
follows [14]:

(12) 
where ⌈~⌉ is  the  ceiling  function,  and  X,  Y  are  the  size  of RFSAFT−CF,𝜃(𝑥, 𝑦) in  two  dimensions,  respectively. 
Besides, the normalization condition has to be satisfied, as discussed by Jeon  et al. [14]. Finally, using the inverse 
Fourier transform, we can transform Kmerged back to the spatial domain, which is the final result after applying D-
SAFT and is denoted as RFD−SAFT(𝑥, 𝑦). 

2.3. R-L deconvolution and MB deconvolution 
As  mentioned  previously,  acoustic  diffraction  still  limits  lateral  resolution  to  no  better  than  in-focus  lateral 
resolution. To further enhance resolution, one can use deconvolution algorithm. Overall, R-L deconvolution and MB 
deconvolution are two typical methods. The underlying assumption is that an AR-PAM imaging system is a linear 
and spatial shift-invariant system. Therefore, the acquired PA image, RF(𝑥, 𝑦), by AR-PAM can be expressed as: 

RF(𝑥, 𝑦) =  p(𝑥, 𝑦)⨂O(𝑥, 𝑦) + n(𝑥, 𝑦), 

(13) 
where p(𝑥, 𝑦) is  the  PSF  of  the  imaging  system, O(𝑥, 𝑦) is  the  original  PA  source  distribution,  and n(𝑥, 𝑦) is  the 
potential  background  noise. ⨂ is  the  convolution  operator. p(𝑥, 𝑦) is  the  prior  knowledge  that  will  be  used  in  the 
algorithm to achieve resolution enhancement, and p(𝑥, 𝑦) is usually obtained from either simulation or experimental 
measurement.  When  the  PSF  is  known,  R-L  deconvolution  can  be  applied  iteratively  to  estimate  the  original  PA 
source distribution, which is expressed as [23,24]: 

′
O𝑖+1

(𝑥, 𝑦) =   [

RF(𝑥, 𝑦)
 p(𝑥, 𝑦)⨂O𝑖

′(𝑥, 𝑦)

⨂p(−𝑥, −𝑦)] O𝑖

′(𝑥, 𝑦) , 

(14) 
′(𝑥, 𝑦) is the estimation of O(𝑥, 𝑦) in the 𝑖th iteration. Different from R-L deconvolution, MB deconvolution 

where O𝑖
expresses the imaging procedure using the following equation: 

RF(𝑥, 𝑦) = H(𝑥, 𝑦) ∗ O(𝑥, 𝑦) + n(𝑥, 𝑦). 

(15) 
where H(𝑥, 𝑦) is  the  dictionary  matrix  [20,21],  and ∗ is  the  matrix  multiplication  operator.  Therefore,  the  original 
PA source distribution could be estimated by the following optimization process: 
Ô(𝑥, 𝑦) = argmin
O(𝑥,𝑦)

2, 
‖RF(𝑥, 𝑦) − H(𝑥, 𝑦) ∗ O(𝑥, 𝑦)‖2

(16) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where Ô(x, y) is the estimation of O(𝑥, 𝑦) by minimizing the above residual term. Besides, a regularization term can 
be used to guarantee sparsity for resolution enhancement [20,21,25,26], and Eq. (16) can be modified as:  

Ô(𝑥, 𝑦) = argmin
O(𝑥,𝑦)

1
(
2

‖RF(𝑥, 𝑦) − H(𝑥, 𝑦) ∗ O(𝑥, 𝑦)‖2

2 + 𝜆‖O(𝑥, 𝑦)‖1), 

(17) 
where 𝜆 is  a  parameter  to  control  the  degree  of  sparsity  and  is  usually  chosen  heuristically.  This  minimization 
process  can  be  solved  with  a  fast  iterative  shrinkage-thresholding  algorithm  (FISTA  implementation  in  Matlab, 
https://github.com/tiepvupsu/FISTA) [27]. As optimization of Ô(𝑥, 𝑦) in Eq. (17) aims at  giving point-like results, 
Gaussian smoothing always follows [20,21]. 

3. Methods 
Overall, our algorithm has two parts, FA-SAFT and D-MB deconvolution, as shown in the green and blue parts in 
Fig. 2, respectively. They are introduced in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 in the following. 

Fig. 2. Procedures of the proposed algorithm. 

3.1. FA-SAFT 
Inspired from the work done by Delbracio  et al. [28], we propose to improve resolution and SNR with FA-SAFT. 
FA-SAFT  is  modified  from  D-SAFT.  Compared  with  D-SAFT,  FA-SAFT  exploits  the  Fourier  bursts  among  1D 
SAFTs  along  different  directions  to  adaptively  enhance  the  spectrum  (k-space),  and  thus,  FA-SAFT  can  produce 
improved results. 

Note that using CF in SAFT (same for D-SAFT and FA-SAFT) can already increase SNR along with its spatial 
resolution.  The  key  to  optimizing  image  enhancement  is  to  identify  the  optimal  synthesis  direction  among  1D 
SAFTs along different directions. Although 1D SAFTs along different directions are utilized in both D-SAFT and 
FA-SAFT, FA-SAFT adopts an improved approach to combine the 1D SAFTs from all directions, leading to further 
improved  resolution  and  SNR.  Detailed  comparison  is  elaborated  in  Section  5.  FA-SAFT  includes  the  following 
steps. First, 1D SAFT is applied to a series of directions using Eqs. (6) and (7). Secondly, the signal is transformed 
into k-space using Eq. (8). Thirdly, K𝜃(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) is accumulated according to the following equations: 
N′−1

Kmerged−FA(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) = ∑ K𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔)

∗ W𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) ∗ D(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) 

𝑛=0

D(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) =

∑

N′−1
𝑛=0

1

abs(K𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔))𝛾

, 

(18) 

 (19) 
where D(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) is a factor used for signal sharpening, abs is the absolute function, and 𝛾 is a variable to control the 
degree of sharpening. When 𝛾 is set to 0, FA-SAFT will be reduced to D-SAFT. Since the spectrum of K𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) 
has higher values in the low-frequency range, its reciprocal, D(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔), has lower values in the low-frequency range 

 
 
 
but higher values in the high-frequency range. That is, D(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) can increase the high-frequency components in k-
space  and  thus  can  enhance  resolution  (details  described  in  Section  5).  Similarly,  using  the  inverse  Fourier 
transform,  we  can  transform Kmerged−FA back  to  spatial  domain  to  get  the  results  after  applying  FA-SAFT  and  is 
denoted as RFFA−SAFT(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡). 

Note  that  the  proposed  FA-SAFT  approach  can  be  further  divided  into  2  types,  depending  on  whether  the 
directional term W𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) is applied in Eq. (18) or not. The  2 types are termed FA-SAFT-dir0 and FA-SAFT-
dir1,  which  are  the  cases  of  without  applying  the  directional  term  and  with  applying  it  in  Eq.  (18),  respectively. 
Then, the results after FA-SAFT will be used for deconvolution. 

3.2. D-MB deconvolution 
As the line pattern only has 1D sparsity, it stands to reason to apply the 1D deconvolution. Therefore, it is crucial to 
recognize the branches in different directions so that the 1D deconvolution along different directions can be applied 
accordingly.  We  use  the  hamming  window  methods  as  before  (Eq.  (10))  to  decompose  the  branches  into  two 
directions that are perpendicular to each other and apply the 1D MB deconvolution with sparsity (Eq. (17)) for the 
branches. The algorithm is thus termed D-MB deconvolution. The detailed procedure is described in the following 
equation: 

RF𝜃𝑛,𝜑𝑚(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝐹−1{𝐹{RFFA−SAFT(𝑥, 𝑦)} ∗ W𝜃𝑛,𝜑𝑚(𝑢, 𝑣)}, 

(20) 
where W𝜃𝑛,𝜑𝑚(𝑢, 𝑣) has  the  same  definition  as  in  Eq.  (10),  except  the  phase  shift 𝜑𝑚,  which  is  associated  with 
image rotation. 𝜑𝑚 is added to Eq. (20) to better extract the signals from the line pattern along different directions 
over the lateral plane. The modified W𝜃𝑛,𝜑𝑚(𝑢, 𝑣)  from Eq. (10) is defined in the following: 

𝜃𝑛̅̅̅(𝑢, 𝑣) = ((𝜃 + Δ𝜃) mod π) −

𝜑𝑚 =

mπ

2M

(21) 

(22) 
where  Δ𝜃  is  the  same  as  Eq.  (12),  and  M  is  the  number  of  times  to  apply  deconvolution  for  different  𝜑𝑚 . 
Accordingly,  the  1D  MB  deconvolution  with  sparsity  applied  to RF𝜃𝑛,𝜑𝑚(𝑥, 𝑦) along  a  certain  direction 𝜃𝑛 and  a 
certain  𝜑𝑚 can be easily modified from (17) and is expressed as:  

Ô𝜃𝑛,𝜑𝑚(𝑥, 𝑦) = argmin
O(𝑥,𝑦)

Note  that 𝜃𝑛 indicates  the  deconvolution  direction,  which  lies  in  the  lateral  plane  and  means  the  direction  along 
which the 1D deconvolution is conducted. The final processed result after D-MB deconvolution is obtained by:

where N"   is set to two. As mentioned above, the hamming window methods are used to decompose the branches 
into  two  perpendicular  directions  (i.e., N" =  2),  and  1D  MB  deconvolution  is  then  applied  for  the  branches.  𝐺 
represents  the  Gaussian  smoothing  operator  following  previous  practice  [20,21]  and  was  applied  during 
composition. Note that since D-MB deconvolution is applied to 2D images, it can be applied to a lateral maximum 
amplitude projection (MAP) image or 2D lateral slices at each axial position. 

M

FA-SAFT  can  be  considered  to  be  independent  of  D-MB  deconvolution.  That  is,  FA-SAFT  and  D-MB 
deconvolution  (with  well-estimated  PSF)  can  be  applied  alone.  Therefore, N′ in  (18)  is  independent  of N" in  (24), 
and N′ can be different  from N". Note that N" =  2 is used because  we  found that too large N" leads to too straight 
branches and thus loses fidelity.  

4. Results 
We  demonstrated  the  feasibility  and  advantages  of  our  algorithm  through  imaging  experiments  of  tungsten  wire 
phantom, leaf skeleton phantom, and mouse dorsal and ear blood vessels in vivo. These experiments were conducted 
using  a  focused  US  transducer  with  center  frequency  of  50  MHz,  NA  of  0.44,  and  focal  length  of  6.7  mm.  The 
results  are  described  in  the  following  subsections.  The  number  of  iterations  for  R-L  deconvolution  (used  for 
comparison) is 15 for tungsten wire experiments and 10 for leaf skeleton experiment and in vivo mouse experiments. 

4.1. Tungsten wire phantom imaging 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We  designed  two  tungsten  wire  phantom  imaging  experiments  to  elaborate  the  effect  of  our  algorithm.  First,  we 
imaged two crossed tungsten wires with an angle of ~90 to quantify full width at half maximum (FWHM) and DOF. 
Secondly, we imaged two closely-located tungsten wires to calibrate the minimum resolvable distance.  

4.1.1. Crossed tungsten wires 
Two tungsten wires with diameter of 20 m were evenly placed at four different OFDs of 0 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.6 mm 
and 0.9 mm (i.e., the axial distance of 6.7 mm, 7.0 mm, 7.3 mm and 7.6 mm, respectively, from the surface of the 
transducer), with one wire overlapping on the other. The four OFDs are denoted as D1D4, respectively. The lateral 
MAP  images  of  raw  data  (i.e.,  RF(𝑥, 𝑦)  without  further  processing)  are  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  S1. 
Supplementary materials are available online. In the images in Supplementary Fig. S1, lateral resolution deteriorates 
as  the abs(OFD)  of  the  wires  increases.  For  convenient  comparison  of  several  algorithms,  we  selected  the  same 
regions with the same size of the images for display (indicated by the white boxes in Supplementary Fig. S1). 

The workflow of our algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. PAM images of D2 are used for illustration. The 𝛾 used in 
FA-SAFT  is  set  to  0.2  (Eq.  (19)).  We  also  compared  FA-SAFT  using  different 𝛾 (see  Supplementary  Fig.  S2). 
Larger 𝛾 generates smaller features size (or FWHM), but too large 𝛾 leads to artifacts. As a result, the optimal 𝛾 is 
set  to  0.2.  For  Fig.  3, N′ = 2 and M = 1 are  used  for  illustration.  Note  that N′ = 16 (as  recommended  previously 
[14])  and M = 4 are  used  for  other  figures  unless  otherwise  specified. M = 4 is  chosen  to  balance  the  processed 
effects and the computation time (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Supplementary Fig. S3 shows that  the initial phase 
shift 𝜑0 does  not  affect  the  D-MB  results  for  the  cases  of M = 4 and M = 8.  Experimentally  measured  PSF  of 65 
m  is  used  when  applying  the  deconvolution  algorithm  [13].  Note  that  since  FA-SAFT  is  to  restore  the  lateral 
resolution in the out-of-focus region to the in-focus lateral resolution, the same lateral PSF can be assumed for AR-
PAM images at different OFDs when applying deconvolution [13].

Fig. 2.  N′ = 2 and M = 1 are used here for illustration. (a) MAP image of raw data at D2 (OFD of 0.3 mm). (b,c)

We  then  studied  the  effects  of  the  directional  term  (Eq.  (18)  with  and  without 𝑊𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔))  and  sharpening 
term (Eq. (18) with and without 𝐷(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔)) in FA-SAFT. PAM images of D2 are used for illustration. The results 
are shown in Fig. 4. Figs. 4a4d show the results as follows: without 𝑊𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) and without 𝐷(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) for Fig. 

 
 
 
4a (termed pure SAFT); with 𝑊𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) and without 𝐷(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) for Fig. 4b (i.e., D-SAFT); without 𝑊𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) 
and  with 𝐷(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) for  Fig.  4c  (i.e.,  FA-SAFT-dir0);  with 𝑊𝜃𝑛(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) and  with 𝐷(𝑢, 𝑣, 𝜔) for  Fig.  4d  (i.e.,  FA-
SAFT-dir1). We found that Fig. 4d achieves better resolution than Fig. 4b. We also compared the performance of R-
L  deconvolution  and  D-MB  deconvolution  based  on  Figs.  4b  and  4d.  Figs.  4e  and  4f  are  the  results  by  R-L 
deconvolution from Figs. 4b and 4d, respectively, and Figs. 4g and 4h are the results by D-MB deconvolution from 
Fig. 4b and 4d, respectively. The results show that Fig. 4f (finer feature size and fewer artifacts) is better than Fig. 
4e, showing the advantage of the proposed FA-SAFT over D-SAFT for the following deconvolution. Similarly, Fig. 
4h  shows  slightly  smaller  feature  size  than  Fig.  4g.  Further,  Fig.  4h  shows  smaller  feature  size,  higher  SNR,  and 
fewer artifacts than Fig. 4f, indicating the benefit of D-MB deconvolution over R-L deconvolution. Moreover, we 
compared  the  deconvolution  results  based  on  Figs.  4c  and 4d  (see  Supplementary  Fig.  S4). The results  show  that 
Supplementary  Fig.  S4f  has  comparable  resolution  to  Supplementary  Fig.  S4c  (similarly,  Supplementary  Fig.  S4e 
comparable to Supplementary Fig. S4b), meaning that both FA-SAFT-dir0 and FA-SAFT-dir1 suit for the following 
deconvolution.  Overall,  for  SAFT,  FA-SAFT  outperforms  D-SAFT.  As  for  deconvolution,  D-MB  deconvolution 
presents better results than R-L deconvolution.

deconvolution from (b) and (d), respectively.  

Then, we compared the results by FA-SAFT-dir1 and D-SAFT in the out-of-focus region (D2D4). Besides, 
R-L deconvolution and D-MB deconvolution were applied and compared for the four  OFDs (D1D4). The results 
are shown in Fig. 5, which are displayed in MAP images. Fig. 5a shows the MAP images of raw data at D1D4. 
Figs. 5b and 5c are the results by D-SAFT and FA-SAFT-dir1, respectively. Figs. 5d5f show the results by  R-L 
deconvolution, 2D MB deconvolution (Eq. (17)), and D-MB deconvolution from Fig. 5c, respectively. The FWHM 
and  SNR  of  the  images  in  Fig.  5  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Note  that  “R-L”,  “MB”,  and  “D-MB”  in  Table  1 
represent the deconvolution results from Fig. 5c (FA-SAFT-dir1). Overall, the results in Fig. 5 and Table 1 for the 
results  at  D1D4  are  consistent  with  Fig.  4.  First,  FA-SAFT-dir1  performs  better  than  D-SAFT.  The  former  has 
smaller  FWHM  and  higher  SNR.  Secondly,  compared  with  R-L  deconvolution,  D-MB  deconvolution  achieves 
better results with smaller FWHM, higher SNR, better pattern continuity, and fewer artifacts. Compared with MB 
deconvolution, D-MB deconvolution keeps the previous advantages except for larger FWHM at D2 and D3. Finally, 
we obtained FWHMs of 2631 m within DOF of 1.8 mm [= 0.9 mm2], when considering below and above the 
focal plane, by D-MB deconvolution from FA-SAFT images.

4.1.2. Closely-located tungsten wires 
Two  wires  with  diameter  of  20  m  were  closely  placed  with  a  narrow  angle  between  them.  The  phantom  was 
imaged at OFDs of 0 mm (i.e., in-focus) and 0.45 mm (i.e., out-of-focus), respectively. The results are shown in 
Fig. 6. PAM images of raw data at the focal and out-of-focus regions are shown in Figs. 6a and 6d, respectively. For 
the  in-focus  image,  we  directly  applied  R-L  deconvolution  (Fig.  6b)  and  D-MB  deconvolution  (Fig.  6c), 
respectively.  For  the  out-of-focus  image,  we  first  applied  FA-SAFT-dir1  (Fig.  6e).  Then,  Fig.  6e  was  further 
processed by R-L deconvolution (Fig. 6f) and D-MB deconvolution (Fig. 6g), respectively. 

The  resolution  is  determined  by  checking  the  minimum  distinguishable  separation  (i.e.,  minimum  resolvable 
distance) of the two tungsten wires (6 dB for the contrast between the minimum of the two peaks and the valley). 
Figs. 6h6k show 1D profiles along the lines #1#4 in Fig. 6, respectively (#1 and #2 at the same positions for Figs. 
6a6c; #3 and #4 at the same positions for Figs. 6d6g). Note that lines #1#4 in Fig. 6 are chosen based on the 
above criterion to determine the resolution of Figs. 6c, 6a, 6g, and 6e, respectively. Similarly, the resolution of Figs. 
6b, 6d, and 6f can be determined using the same criterion (related 1D profiles not shown). As a result, the measured 
resolutions of Figs. 6a6g are 129 m, 76 m, 49 m, 406 m, 108 m, 65 m, and 46 m, respectively. For OFD 
of  0  mm,  the  resolution  is  enhanced  from  129  m  to  49  m  (~2.6  times)  before  and  after  applying  D-MB 
deconvolution (Fig. 6a vs. Fig. 6c). For OFD of 0.45 mm, the resolution is enhanced from 108 m to 46 m (~2.3 
times) before and after applying D-MB deconvolution (Fig. 6e vs. Fig. 6g). Besides, the resolution achieved by D-
MB deconvolution is also better than that by R-L deconvolution (~1.41.6 times improvement).

4.2. Leaf skeleton phantom imaging 
To investigate the ability of our algorithm for more complex structures, we imaged a Banyan leaf skeleton phantom 
and applied our algorithm. Before imaging, the leaf was immersed in carbon ink to increase light absorption of the 
phantom. The results are shown in Fig. 7. PAM images were acquired at both the focal (Fig. 7a) and out-of-focus 
(Fig. 7d) regions. For the in-focus image, we applied the deconvolution algorithms directly (Figs. 7b and 7c). For the 
out-of-focus image, different SAFT and the following deconvolution were applied (Figs. 7e7i).  

Fig.  7.  Results  of  leaf  skeleton  experiment.  (a)  PAM  image  of  raw  data  at  OFD  of  0  mm  (in-focus).  (b,c)  R-L 
deconvolution  and  D-MB  deconvolution  from  (a),  respectively.  (d)  PAM  image  of  raw  data  at  OFD  of  0.25  mm 
(out-of-focus). (eg) By D-SAFT, FA-SAFT-dir1, and FA-SAFT-dir0, respectively. (h,i) R-L deconvolution and D-
MB deconvolution from (g), respectively. (jl) 1D profiles of the images (di) along the three lines indicated by #1, 
#2, and #3 in (d), respectively. 

First, Fig. 7c presents much better image fidelity and smaller feature size than Fig. 7b, demonstrating the great 
performance  of  D-MB  deconvolution  over  R-L  deconvolution.  Secondly,  Figs.  7e7g  are  the  results  by  D-SAFT, 
FA-SAFT-dir1, and FA-SAFT-dir0, respectively. The latter two images show less noise than the former. Similar to 
Supplementary Fig. S4, FA-SAFT-dir0 (Fig. 7g) is comparable to FA-SAFT-dir1 (Fig. 7f). Therefore, we chose to 
apply the deconvolution algorithms to the image by FA-SAFT-dir0 (Fig. 7g). The results are shown in Figs. 7h (R-L 
deconvolution)  and  7i  (D-MB  deconvolution).  Similar  to Figs.  7b  and 7c,  Fig.  7i  shows  better  image  fidelity  and 
smaller feature size than Fig. 7h. We also applied the deconvolution algorithms to the image by FA-SAFT-dir1 (see 
Supplementary  Fig.  S5).  The  comparable  deconvolution  results  from  FA-SAFT-dir1  and  FA-SAFT-dir0  in 
Supplementary Fig. S5 are similar to those in Supplementary Fig. S4. 

For FWHM comparison, we plot 1D profiles along the three lines with different directions in Figs. 7d7i. Note 
that the three lines are at the same positions in Figs. 7d7i. For convenience, the three lines are only indicated in Fig. 
7d and denoted as #1, #2, and #3. The 1D profiles are shown in Fig. 7j7l for lines #1, #2, and #3, respectively. FA-
SAFT-dir0  and  FA-SAFT-dir1  achieve  better  FWHM  than  D-SAFT.  Besides,  as  expected,  D-MB  deconvolution 
produced  smaller  FWHM  compared  with  R-L  deconvolution.  In  addition,  we  rotated  Fig.  7(a)  by  45  to  test  the 
robustness of D-MB deconvolution to different orientations of the line pattern (see Supplementary Fig. S6).  

4.3. In vivo mouse imaging 

 
 
 
 
We further demonstrated our algorithm applied to in vivo mouse imaging. This animal experiment was conducted in 
conformity with the laboratory animal protocol approved by Laboratory Animal Care Committee of  Shanghai Jiao 
Tong University. Mouse dorsal subcutaneous vessels of a BALB/c mouse (∼20 g, Slac Laboratory Animals) with 
hair removed were first imaged by our AR-PAM system. 

Similar to Figs. 7d7i, the images of raw data (at OFD of ~0.4 mm), by D-SAFT, by FA-SAFT-dir1, by FA-
SAFT-dir0,  R-L  deconvolution  after  FA-SFAT-dir0,  and  D-MB  deconvolution  after  FA-SAFT-dir0  are  shown  in 
Figs. 8a8f, respectively. Besides, for resolution comparison, we also plot 1D profiles in Figs. 8g8i along the three 
lines in Figs. 8a8f. The results are overall similar to Fig. 7. First, FA-SAFT-dir0 (Fig. 8d) and FA-SAFT-dir1 (Fig. 
8c) present lower noise than D-SAFT (Fig. 8b). Interestingly, FA-SAFT-dir0 (Fig. 8d) shows slightly higher SNR 
than  FA-SAFT-dir1  (Fig.  8c).  Therefore,  the  deconvolution  based  on  Fig.  8d  was  conducted,  and  the  results  are 
shown in Figs. 8e and 8f by R-L deconvolution and D-MB deconvolution, respectively. Secondly, as expected, D-
MB  deconvolution  (Fig.  8f)  achieves  better  results  than  R-L  deconvolution  in  terms  of  image  fidelity  and  SNR. 
Similarly,  the  deconvolution  applied  to  Fig.  8c  was  also  conducted  for  comparison  (see  Supplementary  Fig.  S7). 
Overall,  Supplementary  Fig.  S7f  shows  slightly  higher  SNR  than  the  corresponding  Supplementary  Fig.  S7c 
(similarly  for  Supplementary  Fig.  S7e  vs.  Fig.  S7b),  which  is  consistent  with  the  results  before  applying 
deconvolution (Supplementary Fig. S7d vs. Supplementary Fig. S7a). Besides, by checking Figs. 8g8i, FA-SAFT-
dir1  and  FA-SAFT-dir0  present  higher  resolution  than  D-SAFT,  and  D-MB  deconvolution  enables  the  smallest 
FWHM.  Figs.  8j8o  show  zoom-in  images  of  the  dashed  box  regions  (indicated  in  Fig.  8a)  in  Figs.  8a8f, 
respectively. Note that the relatively weak PA amplitude of some small vessels in the dashed box region in Fig. 8f 
does not mean that these small vessels disappear after applying deconvolution, but is due to the adopted color map 
for display. As can be seen in Fig. 8o, these small vessels can be clearly visualized with good SNR.

~0.4  mm  (out-of-focus).  (bd)  By  D-SAFT,  FA-SAFT-dir1,  and  FA-SAFT-dir0,  respectively.  (e,f)  R-L 
deconvolution and D-MB deconvolution from (d), respectively. (gi) 1D profiles of the images (af) along the three

For further validation, we tested our algorithm on two other in vivo AR-PAM data: (i) Another image of mouse 
dorsal  blood  vessels  in  vivo  [13] (see  Supplementary  Fig.  S8);  (ii)  mouse  ear  blood  vessels  in  vivo  imaged  at  the 
focal and out-of-focus regions (Figs. 9 and 10). Fig. 9 shows the images of raw data and processed by SAFT and 
deconvolution,  and  Fig.  10  shows  1D  profiles  and  zoom-in  images  indicated  in  Fig.  9  for  better  comparison  and 
display.  The  results  are  promising.  For  Supplementary  Fig.  S8,  overall,  FA-SAFT  performs  better  than  D-SAFT 
(notably high resolution in Supplementary Fig. S8d over Fig. S8b), and D-MB deconvolution produces better results 
than R-L deconvolution (especially pattern continuity in Supplementary Fig. S8f over Fig. S8e). Similarly, for Fig. 9, 
FA-SAFT enables higher resolution than D-SAFT (FA-SAFT vs. D-SAFT: Figs. 9f vs. 9e). Besides, compared with 
R-L deconvolution, D-MB deconvolution renders finer feature size (D-MB vs. R-L: Figs. 9c vs. 9b; Figs. 9i vs. 9h) 
and better pattern continuity (D-MB vs. R-L: Figs. 10f vs. 10e; Figs. 10h vs. 10g). Notably, the high resolution by 
D-MB  deconvolution  is  clearly  evidenced  by  Figs.  10a10d,  where  D-MB  can  better  resolve  two  closely-located 
vessels. Similar to Fig. 8, the relatively weak PA amplitude of some small vessels in the dashed boxes in Fig. 9 is 
due  to  the  adopted  color  map  for  display.  These  small  vessels  can  be  clearly  visualized  with  good  SNR  in  Figs. 
10e10h.

deconvolution  and  D-MB  deconvolution  from  (g),  respectively.  Note  that  D-MB  deconvolution  is  suitable  for 
resolving small feature size (e.g., comparable to or smaller than PSF) and has problems in dealing with large feature 
size.  Therefore,  (c)  and  (i)  are  obtained  by  scaling  down  (a)  and  (g)  (i.e.,  feature  size  reduced)  before  applying 
deconvolution and scaling back (feature size recovered) after deconvolution.

5. Discussion 
We proved that our algorithm can improve the lateral resolution, SNR, and pattern fidelity in both phantom and  in 
vivo  imaging  experiments.  The  great  performance  can  be  attributed  to  two  parts,  FA-SAFT  and  D-MB 
deconvolution. More details are discussed in the following. 

5.1. FA-SAFT 
FA-SAFT  produced  higher  resolution  and  sharper  edges  than  D-SAFT. The  resolution  improvement  in  FA-SAFT 
can be explained from the sharpening term, which is newly introduced in FA-SAFT and acts as an adaptive high-
pass  filter.  For  better  illustration,  we  compared  the  processed  results  and  their  spectra  (k-space)  by  high-pass 
filtering (HPF), D-SAFT (i.e., 𝛾 = 0), and FA-SAFT-dir1 of the crossed tungsten wire images over D2D4 (Section 
4.1.1)  (see  Supplementary  Figs.  S2  and  S9).  In  Supplementary  Fig.  S2,  we  compared  the  results  by  HPF  using 
different  cut-off  frequencies  and  by  FA-SAFT-dir1  using  different 𝛾 .  We  found  that  HPF  with  higher  cut-off 
frequency  produces  smaller  feature  size,  but  HPF  with  too  high  cut-off  frequency  of  3  units  (larger  units 
correspond to higher cut-off  frequency) results in evident artifacts. Thus, the  optimal cut-off frequency is set to 2 
units.  As  mentioned previously, the optimal 𝛾 is set to 0.2. Therefore, we  then compared the  optimized results by 
HPF with cut-off frequency of 2 units and by FA-SAFT-dir1 with 𝛾  0.2. As can be seen, FA-SAFT-dir1 with 𝛾  
0.2 shows well-suppressed background (or high SNR).  

In Supplementary Fig. S9, we first checked the case of D2. Compared with HPF, FA-SAFT-dir1 did not filter 
out  all  the  low-frequency  components  but  adjusted  their  weights  adaptively,  as  indicated  by  the  red  arrows  in 
Supplementary  Fig.  S9.  Besides,  compared  with  [HPF][D-SAFT]  (“”  means  difference),  [FA-SAFT-dir1][D-
SAFT] can more selectively enhance the images along the directions of the tungsten wires (i.e., increased weights in 
the spectra of FA-SAFT-dir1 along the two diagonal directions corresponding to the main signals of tungsten wires), 
showing that the sharpening term in FA-SAFT-dir1 can better reflect directional features of the data compared with 
HPF. In other words, the sharpening term in FA-SAFT-dir1 can increase the weights of high-frequency components 
adaptively. Here the “adaptive” means that the sharpening term changes accordingly with the 1D SAFT results as in 
Eq.  (19)  and  enhances  the  spectrum  directionally.  Specifically,  for  example,  as  indicated  by  the  green  arrows  in 
Supplementary  Fig.  S9,  the  spectrum  not  along  the  directions  of  the  tungsten  wires  are  more  suppressed  in  [FA-

 
 
 
SAFT-dir1][D-SAFT]  than  in  [HPF][D-SAFT].  As  can  be  seen  in  Supplementary  Fig.  S9,  the  same 
characteristics are observed in D3 and D4.  

Therefore,  Supplementary  Fig.  S9  would  explain  that  compared  with  HPF,  FA-SAFT-dir1  can  enhance 
resolution  (having  similar  high-frequency  components)  and  without  sacrificing  SNR  (enhancing  the  spectrum 
directionally, as detailed in the previous paragraph). Similarly, Supplementary Fig. S9 would also explain compared 
with D-SAFT, FA-SAFT-dir1 enables higher resolution (keeping more high-frequency components, as shown in the 
columns of “FA-SAFT-dir1” vs. “D-SAFT”) and higher SNR (enhancing the spectrum directionally, as shown in the 
column of [FA-SAFT-dir1][D-SAFT]). 

Another variable in FA-SAFT is the  number of directions for 1D SAFT (N′ in Eq. (18)). As discussed in D-
SAFT [14], using more directions (larger N′) is useful to improve the resolution of branches in different orientations. 
However, when N′ is large enough (≥ 16), the image quality may not improve anymore. Therefore, N′ is also set to 
16 in our demonstrations. 

Overall, FA-SAFT-dir0 produces comparable or slightly better results than FA-SAFT-dir1 (e.g., slightly better 
for  Fig.  8  and  Supplementary  Fig.  S8).  Besides,  either  FA-SAFT-dir0  or  FA-SAFT-dir1  performs  better  than  D-
SAFT  for  the  demonstrations  in  this  work  (Figs.  49).  This  may  imply  that  the  sharpening  term  plays  a  more 
important role than the directional term in Eq. (18). On the other hand, the following deconvolution (either R-L or 
D-MB) exhibits similar trends (e.g., similar results after deconvolution are obtained given similar image quality of 
FA-SAFT-dir0 and FA-SAFT-dir1). 

SAFT  in  AR-PAM  has  been  continuously  improved  to  deal  with  more  complicated  patterns,  especially  for 
microvascular patterns, to meet the requirements of in vivo imaging applications. By considering 1D sparsity of the 
line pattern, A-SAFT and D-SAFT were proposed [10,14]. However, the former requires successful recognition of 
diverse  orientations  of  vessel  branches  prior  to  applying  A-SAFT,  while  the  latter  can  better  recover  the  vessel 
branches  by  utilizing  the  weighted  1D  SAFTs.  Based  on  D-SAFT,  we  proposed  FA-SAFT  to  further  improve 
resolution and SNR by introducing the sharpening term, as detailed previously. Deconvolution can perform better 
given the original input images with better image quality. Taking advantage of the high-quality image by FA-SAFT, 
D-MB deconvolution using FA-SAFT images outperforms that using D-SAFT images. 

5.2. D-MB deconvolution 
After  FA-SAFT, deconvolution  algorithms  further  improve  the  resolution  and  SNR.  R-L  deconvolution  algorithm 
was  initially  designed  for  astronomy  applications,  where  the  targets  are  usually  point-like  objects.  Zhu  et  al.  first 
introduced R-L deconvolution for PAM imaging [29]. Compared to R-L deconvolution and MB deconvolution, the 
proposed  D-MB  deconvolution  is  more  suitable  for  the  line  pattern  because  1D  sparsity  of  the  line  pattern  is 
considered in D-MB deconvolution. To our knowledge, the directional deconvolution method for handling the line 
pattern is proposed for the first time. Besides the line pattern, D-MB deconvolution with 𝑀4 can well preserve the 
point  features  (see  Supplementary  Fig.  S10).  Another  parameter  in  D-MB  deconvolution  is  the  sparsity 
regularization term, which contributes to the pattern centralization (i.e., resolution enhancement) and noise reduction 
to an extent (see Supplementary Fig. S11). Finally, our algorithm (FA-SAFT and D-MB deconvolution) achieved 
lateral FWHMs of 2631 m when imaging 20 m tungsten wires (Fig. 5), which is better than measured PSF of 65 
m. Besides, lateral resolution of 4649 m was obtained when resolving two closely-located tungsten wires (Fig. 
6),  which  is  better  than  original  resolution  of  129406  m.  Note  that  the  “sparsity”  here  does  not  mean  that  the 
pattern of the input PA image has to be sparse in order to apply the D-MB deconvolution. It works well in Figs. 7, 8, 
and S8, which proves that it is applicable to the AR-PAM images with a certain degree of pattern density. 

To  improve  3D  resolution  for  the  line  pattern  of  blood  vessels  in  AR-PAM  images,  the  proposed  D-MB 
deconvolution can be applied to 2D lateral slices at each axial position, and then 1D R-L or 1D MB deconvolution 
can be applied along the axial direction [13]. Considering that the line pattern of blood vessels mainly appears over 
the  2D  lateral  slices,  it  would  be  reasonable  to  apply  1D  deconvolution  along  the  axial  direction  without  dealing 
with  the  directional  characteristic.  Besides,  such  a  method  for  3D  deconvolution  can  save  computation  time  and 
reduce memory usage [13]. 

5.3. Other discussion 
As AR-PAM  is  a 3D imaging  modality,  we evaluated the  axial resolution changes  when using our algorithm (see 
Supplementary Fig. S12 and Supplementary Table S1). We found that axial resolution after FA-SAFT and D-MB 
deconvolution is comparable or slightly improved. SAFT is typically  not expected to improve the axial resolution 
[13]. On the other hand, in Supplementary Fig. S12, D-MB deconvolution is applied to 2D lateral slices at each axial 
position  (multiple-times  deconvolution  for  many  slices).  Because  deconvolution  is  not  applied  along  the  axial 

 
 
direction, the resolution enhancement along the axial direction is not obvious. Note that except Supplementary Fig. 
S12, D-MB deconvolution is performed over the MAP images (e.g., Figs. 7i and 8f). 

The  robustness  of  the  algorithm  to  different  SNR  is  also  an  important  factor  worthy  to  discuss.  Indeed, 
sufficient SNR is essential for deconvolution. Fortunately, in our algorithm, the first step, FA-SAFT, helps improve 
SNR  for out-of-focus images  prior to applying the  second  step, D-MB deconvolution. In Supplementary  Fig.  S13 
and  Supplementary  Table  S2,  the  effect  of  SNR  on  the  resolution  enhancement  by  FA-SAFT  and  D-MB 
deconvolution  is  evaluated.  Note  that  the  resolution  in  Supplementary  Table  S2  is  determined  using  a  criterion 
similar  to  Fig.  6.  When  artifacts  become  too  evident  to  determine  resolution,  the  resolution  is  regarded  as  “not 
applicable (N/A).” As can be seen, when the PAM image of raw data has peak SNR (PSNR) down to 20 dB (Fig. 6d 
with  noise  added),  FA-SAFT  and  D-MB  deconvolution  can  still  enhance  resolution  from  N/A  to  54  m.  On  the 
other  hand,  in  Supplementary  Fig.  S14  and  Supplementary  Table  S3,  the  effect  of  SNR  on  the  resolution 
enhancement  by  D-MB  deconvolution  alone  is  investigated.  The  determination  of  resolution  in  Supplementary 
Table S3 is the same as Supplementary Table S2 mentioned above. As can be seen, when the PAM image by FA-
SAFT (prior to applying deconvolution) has PSNR down to 21 dB (Fig. 6e with noise added), D-MB deconvolution 
can still enhance resolution from N/A to 54 m, while R-L deconvolution suffers artifacts and the resolution is still 
N/A. Overall, in Supplementary Fig. S14, D-MB deconvolution produces better image quality (i.e., fewer artifacts) 
than R-L deconvolution. 

Another  important  factor  is  the  performance  of  the  proposed  algorithm  when  applied  to  images  with 
penetration  depth  in  tissue.  We  conducted  additional  in  vivo  AR-PAM  imaging  of  subcutaneous  blood  vessels 
around the lower abdomen region of a mouse. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S15, the proposed algorithm 
demonstrates  good  performance  for  the  in  vivo  AR-PAM  images  with  penetration  depth  of  ~0.32  mm.  Besides, 
although the skin surface is not flat and the blood vessels distribute over a large  axial range, our algorithm applied 
for a large axial range of 1.35 mm (OFD from 0.525 mm to 0.825 mm) shows satisfactory results. We further and 
intentionally sought deeper blood vessels in AR-PAM imaging experiments. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 
S16  (notably  the  blood  vessel  V3),  the  proposed  algorithm  still  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of  resolution 
enhancement for the in vivo AR-PAM image of deep vessels up to ~1.3 mm below the skin surface.  

In the experiments described above, the penetration depth of ~1.3 mm was demonstrated. AR-PAM is able for 
deeper penetration in tissue. In this case, however, SNR degrades, and low SNR adversely affects the performance 
of the proposed algorithm, as described previously (Supplementary Fig. S13, Table S2, Fig. S14, and Table S3). To 
advance  the  penetration  of  in  vivo  AR-PAM  when  applying  our  algorithm,  one  could  consider  signal  averaging 
and/or contrast agents to secure sufficient SNR, which would ensure in vivo applicability of our algorithm. 

In Section 4.1, the tungsten wires were immersed in non-scattering water media and placed at different OFDs 
(e.g., 00.9 mm), and the performance of the algorithms at different OFDs can be conveniently compared (Table 1 
and  Figs.  5  and  6)  by  excluding  the  scattering  effect.  Similar  experiments  were  conducted  also  in  non-scattering 
water media in a previous study of resolution enhancement in AR-PAM [30]. Similar to the above discussion, strong 
scattering leads to low SNR,  which degrades the performance of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, for scattering 
media, approaches to boost SNR are needed to ensure the performance of our algorithm. 

The  computation  time  of  our  algorithm  is  another  important  aspect.  For  FA-SAFT,  the  computation  time  is 
mainly determined by the number of directions for 1D SAFT (N′) and is proportional to N′, which is similar to the 
case  of  D-SAFT  (Supplementary  Table  S4).  That  is,  the  inclusion  of  the  sharpening  term  (specifically,  for  FA-
SAFT-dir1)  in  the  calculation  will  increase  the  computation  time  little  (the  time  increase  of  ~0.2  seconds  in 
Supplementary Table S4 for N′ = 16). Therefore, once the same N′ is chosen for D-SAFT and FA-SAFT, they will 
have  similar  computation  time  (Supplementary  Table  S4).  For  D-MB  deconvolution,  more  computation  time  is 
required compared with R-L deconvolution (Supplementary Table S5). Fortunately, the computation time of D-MB 
deconvolution is less than that of FA-SAFT, and thus, the overall computation time of our algorithm is still at the 
same  time  scale  as  FA-SAFT  (FA-SAFT  of  ~72  s  (N′ =  16)  and  D-MB  deconvolution  of  ~8  s  ( M  =  4)  in 
Supplementary Table S4 and Table S5, respectively). 

6. Conclusions 
Tailored for AR-PAM imaging applications of microvasculature, we proposed a novel algorithm consisting of FA-
SAFT and D-MB deconvolution for AR-PAM to achieve evident image enhancement in both the focal and out-of-
focus  regions.  Specifically,  FA-SAFT  improved  resolution  and  SNR,  and  D-MB  deconvolution  further  enhanced 
resolution  and  SNR  while  keeping  image  fidelity.  As  a  result,  compared  with  other  SAFT  and/or  deconvolution 
algorithms, our algorithm achieved great performance in terms of resolution, SNR, and image fidelity. Notably, we 
demonstrated promising results for in vivo images of mouse blood vessels by our algorithm given the images of raw 
data with sufficient SNR. Our work opens up new opportunities for microvascular AR-PAM imaging applications.

Fig. S3. Results of the crossed tungsten wire phantom at D2 by D-MB deconvolution with various M and 0 in Eq. (24). As

processed effects and the computation time, M = 4 is chosen for Figs. 410.

range of 3.3 mm). (b1b5) PAM images in MAP over the axial range of 0.45 mm above the focus (OFD from 0.525 mm to 
0.075  mm).  From  top  to  bottom:  (b1)  PAM  image  of  raw  data,  (b2,b3)  by  D-SAFT  and  FA-SAFT-dir1  from  (b1), 
respectively, (b4,b5) by R-L deconvolution and D-MB deconvolution from (b3), respectively. (c1c5) PAM images in MAP

red line indicates the focal plane of the transducer (i.e., OFD of 0 mm), the green box indicates the axial range of 0.45 mm 
above the focus for (b1b5), and the blue box indicates the axial range of 0.6 mm below the focus for (c1c5). In (d), the 
pointed vessel V1 is ~0.3 mm below the skin surface S, and the corresponding vessel in PAM images is indicated by the 
arrows in (c1c5). In (e), the pointed vessel V2 is ~0.32 mm below the skin surface S, and the corresponding vessel in PAM 
images  is  indicated  by  the  arrows  in  (b1b5).  As  can  be  seen  in  (b1b5)  and  (c1c5)  such  as  V1  and  V2,  the  proposed 
algorithm demonstrates good performance for the in vivo AR-PAM images with penetration depth of ~0.32 mm. (f,g) Zoom-

vessels are intentionally sought in AR-PAM imaging experiments. (a1a5) PAM images in MAP over the axial range of 0.6 
mm above the focus (OFD from 0.8 mm to 0.2 mm). The images: (a1) PAM image of raw data, (a2,a3) by D-SAFT and 
FA-SAFT-dir1 from (a1), respectively, (a4,a5) by R-L deconvolution and D-MB deconvolution from (a3), respectively. (a6) 
B-mode image of raw data along the line L1 in (a1). The red line indicates the focal plane of the transducer (i.e., OFD of 0 
mm) and the green box indicates the  axial range of 0.6 mm above the focus for (a1a5). In (a6), the pointed vessel V1 is 
~0.37  mm  below  the  skin  surface  S,  and  the  corresponding  vessel  in PAM  images  is  indicated  by  the  arrows  in  (a1a5). 
(b1b5) PAM images in MAP over the axial range of 0.6 mm below the focus (OFD from 0 mm to 0.6 mm). The images: 
(b1) PAM image of raw data, (b2,b3) by D-SAFT and FA-SAFT-dir1 from (b1), respectively, (b4,b5) by R-L deconvolution 
and D-MB deconvolution from (b3), respectively. (b6) B-mode image of raw data along the line L2 in (b1). The red line 
indicates the focal plane of the transducer (i.e., OFD of 0 mm) and the blue box indicates the axial range of 0.6 mm below 
the focus for (b1b5). In (b6), the pointed vessel V2 is ~0.5 mm below the skin surface S, and the corresponding vessel in 
PAM images is indicated by the arrows in (b1b5). (c1c5) PAM images in MAP over the axial range of 0.6 mm below the 
focus (OFD from 0 mm to 0.6 mm). The images: (c1) PAM image of raw data, (c2,c3) by D-SAFT and FA-SAFT-dir1 from 
(c1), respectively, (c4,c5) by R-L deconvolution and D-MB deconvolution from (c3), respectively. (b6) B-mode image of 
raw data along the line L3 in (c1). The red line indicates the focal plane of the transducer (i.e., OFD of 0 mm) and the blue 
box indicates the axial range of 0.6 mm below the focus for (c1c5). In (c6), the pointed vessel V3 is up to ~1.3 mm below 
the skin surface S, and the corresponding vessel in PAM images is indicated by the arrows in (c1c5). As can be seen in the 
blood vessel V3 in (c1c6), the proposed algorithm still demonstrates the effectiveness of resolution enhancement for the in 
vivo AR-PAM image of deep vessels up to ~1.3 mm below the skin surface. A few artifacts observed in (c4) and (c5) could 
be due to relatively poor image quality in (c1).
