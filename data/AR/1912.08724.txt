Abstract  

The solid noble gases Ar, Xe and Kr equations of state and their melting data 
are  fitted  by  applying    Lindemann-Gilvarry  criterion.  Assuming  isochoric 
conditions  in  the  DAC  the  Lindemann-Gilvarry  criterion  is  applicable  for 
predicting the melting curves and equations of state of the above three noble 
gasses.  The  demand  that  the  fitting  of  the  experimental  EOS  (P-V  space) 
data  will  simultaneously  fit  the  experimental  cold  melting  data  reveal  a 
completely different bulk moduli reported in the literature. The  bulk moduli 
Bo  ,  Bo’  which  are    derived  simultaneously  and  separately  for  each 
crystallographic phase ( fcc or hcp) indicate much harder behavior contrary 
to very soft behavior reported previously. This explains the curvature in the 
melting  data  reported  by  Boehler  et  al.  [21].  In  addition,  the  combined 
approach lead to direct determination of  the Grüneisen parameter  γo, thus a 
safe extrapolation of the melting curve to high pressures and temperatures is 
achieved.

1. Introduction  

In the present paper it is shown that the Lindemamm's criterion is applicable 
to  the  solid  noble  gases  Ar,  Xe  and  Kr.  The  crystal  structures  of  the  solid 
rare gases have been of particular interest as first principal  calculations have 
indicated that for these van der Waals crystals the static lattice energy point 
cubic  (fcc)  and  close-packed  hexagonal  (hcp)  structures.  However,  
calculations  based  on  pairwise  interactions  have  predicted  greater  stability 
for  the  hcp  structure  which  is  experimentally  observed  at  pressures  above 
20GPa.The determination of the pressure dependent melting temperatures of 
solids has drawn the attention of the scientific community for many years. 
In the present contribution we apply Lindemamm's criterion for prediction of 
melting  curves,  understanding  that  this  criterion  is  not  a  theoretical  model 
based on first principles but a phenomenological approach to the behavior of 
solids.  We  adopt  and  trust  the  Lindemann  criterion  improved  by  Gilvarry, 
known as  Lindemann-Gilvarry (LG) criterion [1]. Prediction of the melting 
point at high pressures and temperatures for metals utilizing the LG criterion 
needs  the  Grüneisen  parameter  γ.  The  procedure  utilizing  the  LG  criterion 
together with Grüneisen parameter  γ  according to the Slater model [2] often 
does  not  fit  the  experimental  melting  results.  In  a  recent  publication  [3]  I 
have  proposed  a  different  fitting  procedure  which  takes  into  account 
simultaneously  the  LG  criterion    (P-T  space)  together  with  the  equation  of 
state (EOS P-V space). In this procedure the shock waves melting data serve 
as anchor to determine the actual melting curve measured in a diamond anvil 
cell  (DAC).  The  LG  formulation uses  the  bulk  modulus  B  and  its pressure 
derivative B’ as fit parameters deduced directly from the EOS, however, the 
results  are  not  unique  depending  on  the  chosen  EOS.  Numerous  EOS  are 
available most of them need two free parameters; the bulk moduli B and B’ 
which  are  deduced  from  the  P-V  room  temperature  isotherm  and  are 
assigned Bo and Bo’. Nevertheless, the fitting of the experimental data in the 
P-V  space  strongly  depend  on  the  chosen  equation  of  state.  The  reported 
values  of  Bo  and  Bo’    span  up  to    ~  50%  (see  tables  I,II)  and  the  question 
remain  which    bulk  moduli  should  be  addressed.  The  bulk  moduli  are  of 
basic importance for the prediction of melting curves at high pressures and 
temperatures for materials utilizing the LG criterion.

In the present contribution it is shown that the solid noble gases Ar, Xe and 
Kr equations of state and their melting data can be fitted by applying  
Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion. Different from the literature the bulk moduli 
derived for the fcc and hcp phases indicate less compressible materials, 
contrary to very soft materials reported in previous publications. 

2. Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion 

According to Lindenmann’s criterion the melting temperature Tm is related 
to the Debye temperature ӨD as follows: 

2                                         (1) 

                       Tm = C V3/2 ӨD
Where V is the volume and C is a constant to be derived for each 
 specific metal. In the Debye model the Grüneisen parameter  γ is defined by 
 γ =   ln ӨD /  ln V. As shown by Anderson and Isaak [4] combining (1) and 
by inserting  Vo/V = /o, and integrating one gets the form of LG criterion 
of the melting temperature Tm : 

                              Tm() =Tmo exp {

[2 γ –2/3] d/ }          (2) 

Where  ρo  is  a  reference  density,  ρ  is  the density  at  the  melt  and  Tmo  is the 
melting temperature at the reference density . Integrating (2)  assuming that  
γ = γo (o /)q   and   q= 1 one gets: 

                    Tm() = Tmo (o /)2/3  exp[2 γo (1- o /)]            (3) 

where γo is defined as the Grüneisen parameter at ambient conditions. 

3 

o 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Equation (3) states that if  (P), Tmo and γo are known the melting curve 
Tm(P) can simply be determined assuming that the relation between P and  is 
 known. It is well accepted that the pressure in the P-V-T space is given by:  

    P(V,T) = PC+ γlattice Cv lattice  [T-To+Eo/Cv lattice] + ¼ o γe βo (ρ/ρo)1/2 T2     (4) 

Here Pc is the cold pressure, Cv is the lattice specific heat above To, To is the 
ambient  temperature.  Cv,lattice  is  taken  as  constant  (usually  at  room 
temperature, following the approximation of Altshuler et al. [5] ) , Eo is the 
lattice thermal energy at To and  γlattic is the lattice Grüneisen parameter. γe is 
electronic  Grüneisen  parameter  and  βo  is  the  electronic  specific  heat 
coefficient (Altshuler ref.[5] and Kormer ref.[6]). It is customary to analyze 
EOS and melting experiments in terms of room temperature isotherms using 
Murnaghan  [7],Vinet  [8]  and    Birch-  Murnaghan  [9]  EOS  for  deriving  Pc. 
The  parameters  of  these  equations  are  the  ambient  condition  bulk  modulus 
Bo  and its pressure derivative  Bo’.    In DAC experiments the volume of the 
tested material close to the melt must be known and is essential to apply the 
LG  theory.  Under  the  assumption of  isochoric  conditions  one    can  directly 
use the measured volume in compression at room temperature. It can be also 
measured  insitu while heating the compressed  sample. In most experiments 
the  material  is  compressed  at  room  temperature  and  then  heated  to  the 
melting  point.  Such  experiments  usually  present  the  measured  pressure  ( 
Ruby’s  line  shifts)  at  ambient  temperature.  These  experiments  ignore  the 
thermal contribution (actual pressure) and the results are usually presented as 
the melting temperature vs. the cold pressure at ambient  temperature, known 
as the cold melting curve. 

The  relation  between  PC    and  the  density  (P)  for  the  room  temperature 
isotherms frequently used are:  

 Murnaghan :      Pc=  Bo/ Bo’ ( (/o)-B’)    (MUR) (5) 

 Vinet : Pc=  3Bo (/o)-2/3 [1-(o/)1/3] exp{3/2( B’-1)[1 -(o/)1/3]} (VIN)  (6)   

and 

Birch-Murnaghan: 
    Pc= 3/2 Bo [(/o)7/3-(/o)5/3] [1+3/4(B’-4){ (/o)2/3-1}]      BM    (7) 

  Where  is density and B= - V (P/V) is the definition of the bulk modulus 
and B’ is the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus ( B’=B/P). B and B’ 
are fit parameters of the room temperature isotherm assigned as Bo and Bo’.

It is well known that the best fit solutions are not unique and strongly depend 
on  the  chosen  EOS  (eq.6,7,8).    This  is  the  reason  why  diverse  results  are 
obtained  by  different  authors.  Thus,  it  make  sense  to  introduce  a  different 
procedure in order to improve  the fittings of the data in the P-V and the P-T 
planes  using the above equations of state.  

  The  basic  assumption is  that  in  an ideal  DAC  under  each  applied  pressure, 
starting  from  ambient  pressure  and  temperature,  as  raising  the  temperature 
and  approaching  the  melt,  the  sample  under  investigation  sense  isochoric 
condition.  Isochoric condition  in  the  DAC  means  that  the  thermal  pressure 
Pth and the melting temperature Tm increase upon heating the sample. Thus, 
actual  pressure  eq.4  P(V,T)  should  be  used  for  deriving  the  extrapolated 
melting curve.  

The  following  four  steps  procedure  to  determine  the  correct  melting  curve 
(the combined approach) was proposed in Ref.3: 

1.  Utilizing  Lindemann-Gilvarry  criterion  (eq.5)  with  γeff  as  free 
parameter  and    optimizing    Bo  and  Bo’  by  choosing  the  appropriate 
EOS  (out  of    eqs.6,7  or  8)  which  best  fit  simultaneously  the 
experimental P-V data (isotherm 300K) and the experimental melting 
P-T  data.  Thus  obtaining  Pc  forming  the  cold  melting  curve.  In  LG 
eq.5 Tmo and Vo are the melting temperature  and volume at ambient 
pressure.   

2.  Adding  the  calculated  thermal  pressure  Pth  to  Pc  obtaining  the  LG 
melting curve accounting for the actual pressure (isochoric condition) 
sensed  by  the  investigated  sample.  Demanding  that  the  thermally 
corrected  melting  curve  will  include  the  shock  wave  melting  data  as 
anchors. The Grüneisen parameter γo is derived   accordingly.  

3.  Plotting  the  volume  compression  V/Vo  vs.  the  thermally  corrected 

melting temperatures obtained in 2.  

   4. Extrapolating the derived thermally corrected melting curve to high 

pressures and temperatures.

It has been shown that applying this procedure  lead to safe extrapolation of 
the melting curves to high pressures and temperatures for Al,Cu, and U 
metals [3] and to direct determination of Bo, Bo’ as well as  the Grüneisen 
parameters γeff and γo.   
In  the  present  contribution  the  combined  approach  is  applied  to  three 
compressed  noble  solid  gases  Ar,Xe  and  Kr.  As  these  solids  are  highly 
compressible (soft) materials, the thermal contribution (Pth) is negligible. It 
is indeed a better test to start with when checking the combined  approach on 
aluminum  [3].    To  conclude,  the  combined  approach  (step  1)  should  be 
applied in the case of the compressed noble gases. It is shown below that the  
bulk moduli Bo , Bo’ and γeff  are derived simultaneously and separately for 
each crystallographic phase ( fcc or hcp). Surprisingly, in the cases of Ar,Xe 
and Kr best fits were obtained with MUR EOS (eq.5), though VIN(eq.6) or  
BM (eq.7) can do the job. 

3. Fitting Results 

Argon 

The  solid argon phase diagram and equation of state are depicted in Fig.1 . 
The melting curve of the fcc and hcp phases  fitted simultaneously separately 
of each crystallographic  phase according to the combined approach step 1. 
The  best  fits  were  obtained  by  MUR  (eq.5).  In  the  fcc  region  the 
parametrization  reveal  Bo=8.3(3)GPa  and  Bo’=3.5(1)  where  γeff=  γo=  1.7  
(assigned  8.3/3.5/1.7).  In the  hcp  region the  melting  curve  reveal Bo=13(1) 
GPa and Bo’=3.5(1) with γeff= γo= 2.27  (assigned 13/3.5/2.27). Equation of 
state  P-V  space  shown  in  Fig.1b  .  The  experimental  data  were  reported by 
Ross and Mao [19] and up to 114GPa by Arrandonea et al. [20].  
The  melting  curve  of  compressed  Ar  was    measured    by  and  reported   
R.Boehler et al.[21]. Depicted in Fig.1c, within  the combined approach step 
3, V/Vo v.s the melting temperature is calculated with the above parameters. 
The derived Vo is 32.6(2) Å3/at. as expressed in Fig.1b .      

Note  that  the  phase  transition  (curvature)  observed  in  the  melting  curve  is 
also clearly pronounced in P-V space (Fig.1b).

The  solid Xe phase diagram and equation of state are depicted in Fig.2 . The 
melting curve of the fcc and hcp phases  fitted simultaneously separately for 
each crystallographic  phase according to the combined approach step 1. The 
best fits were obtained by MUR (eq.5). In the fcc region the parametrization 
reveal  Bo=7.0(2)GPa  and  Bo’=5.8(1)  where  γeff=  γo=  2.7  assigned  in  Fig.2a 
(7/5.8/2.7). In the hcp region the melting curve reveal Bo=40.0(3) GPa and 
Bo’=3.0(2)  with  γeff=  1.0    (assigned  40/3/1).  Equation  of  state  in  the  P- 
space of the fcc and hcp structures are shown in Fig.2b . The experimental 
data were reported by Jephcoat [22] and up to 173GPa by Shindo et al. [23].  

The  melting  of  compressed  Xe  was    measured    by  R.Boehler  et  al.[21]. 
Depicted  in  Fig.2c,  within    the  combined  approach  step-3  V/Vo  v.s  the 
melting temperature is calculated with the above parameters and  is depicted 
in the figure. o=4.2 g/cc (Vo=31.5Å3/at.) is calculated for Xe-hcp as shown 
in Fig.2b (different than reported in [24,25]). 

Krypton 

The  solid Kr phase diagram and equations of state are depicted in Fig.3 . 
The melting curve of compressed Kr was  measured  by R.Boehler et al.[21]. 
The melting curve of the fcc and hcp phases  fitted simultaneously separately 
or  each crystallographic  phase according to the combined approach step 1 
and  are  shown  in  Figs.  3(a),(b).  The  best  fits  were  obtained  with  MUR 
(eq.5).  In  the  fcc  region  the  parametrization  reveal  Bo=5.5(2)GPa  and 
Bo’=3.8(1)  where  γeff=  γo=  2.8  assigned  in  Fig.3a  (5.5/3.8/2.8).  In  the  hcp 
region fitting the melting curve experimental data [21] reveal Bo=40(3) GPa 
and Bo’=3.2(2) with γeff = 1.30  (assigned 40/3.2/1.30). Note that  the derived 
density at P=0.7 GPa is 4.48 g/cc different than is given in the literature [25] 
(see discussion). Equation of state in P- space of the fcc and hcp phases are 
shown in  Fig.3b  .  The  experimental  data  relate  to  A.  Polian  [26],  Jephcoat 
[27] and Rosa [28].

Discussion  

Already  in  1964  based  on  low  temperatures  XRD    measurements  Lothar 
Meyer  at  al.  [29]  reported    existence  of  the  hcp  phase  in  solid  Ar. 
Computations based on pairwise interactions have predicted greater stability 
for the hexagonal rather than the cubic structures. 

Pressure-induced  fcc  to  hcp  first  order  transition  (martensitic)  has  been 
reported in all the solid noble gasses Ar,Xe and Kr. In this process, the low-
pressure fcc phase transforms to an hcp phase as stacking disorder in the fcc 
lattice  grows  into  the  stable  hcp  domains  with  increasing  pressure.  The 
stacking disorder  lead to defuse scattering in Xe and Kr as has been reported 
by Cynn et al. [30].  

The  experimental  melting  data  of  Ar,Xe  and  Kr  solids  were  measured  by 
R.Boehler, M. Ross, P. Soederlind and B. Boercker and reported in ref. [21]. 
Their  results  are  the  basis  of  the present contribution.  The  curvature  in  the 
melting  curves  is  attributed  to  the  phase  transitions  from  the  fcc  to  hcp 
structures based on  previous EOS measurements. Indeed, the high-pressure 
melting data of Ar, Kr, and Xe deviate from theoretical theories [21] as the 
separate treatment of each crystallographic phase was not considered.  

First principle theoretical calculations of the melting curve of argon by using 
Lindemann’s  criterion  have  been performed by  Cl´oves  G.  Rodrigues  [31]. 
Nevertheless  these  calculations  miss  the  experimental  results.  Another 
attempt  to  fit  the  melting  curve  of  the  solid  noble  gases  using  the  LG 
criterion  to  was  introduced  by  Zheng-Hua  Fang  [32]  reveal  unacceptable 
bulk  moduli  proving  that  even  by  assuming  four  parameters  in  equation  2 
(Bo,Bo’,C1  and  q)  the  fcc  and  the  hcp  data  can’t  be  reasonably  fitted.  Both 
attempts  report  Bo<2GPa  which  are  related  to  highly  compressible  liquids 
like Propylene glycol or Glycerol [34]. The reason for these discrepancies comes 
from  ignoring  the  fact  that  the  crystallographic  fcc  structure  and  the  hcp 
phase should have been treated separately.  

Pressure induced transformation from insulator to metal of solid Xe at have 
been subjected to many articles  and is indeed related to its hcp band 
structure.  Namely, electron transfer to the empty 5d conduction band from 
the full 5p valence band resulting volume reduction [33]. The similarity 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the elastic properties of Xe and Kr suggest that insulator to metal 
transition should be expected also in compressed solid Kr. 

The  solid  lines  in  Fig.1,2,3  (b)  represents  the  fcc  region  as  derived  by  the 
parameters obtained by best simultaneous fitting of the melting experimental 
data shown in Fig.1,2,3(a).  All figures indicate very sharp phase transition 
of a first order type. The cold melting curve fitting of hcp Ar,Xe,Kr revealed 
relative  soft  materials,  namely  materials  exhibiting  Bo<  50GPa    (see  Table 
III).  It  is  assumed  that  in  such  cases  the contribution of  Pth  is  rather  small. 
However,  adding  small  Pth  the  actual  melting  curve  could  be  somewhat 
flattened.

Conclusions 

By  assuming  isochoric  conditions  in  the  DAC  the  Lindemann-Gilvarry 
criterion  is  applicable  for  predicting  the  melting  curves  and  equations  of 
state of the three noble gasses Ar,Xe and Kr. The demand that the fitting of 
the  experimental  EOS  (P-V  space)  data  will  simultaneously  fit  the 
experimental  cold  melting  data  reveal  a  completely  different  bulk  moduli 
reported  in  the  literature.  This  explains  the  curvature  in  the  melting  data 
reported by Boehler et al. [21].  In addition, the combined approach  lead  to
