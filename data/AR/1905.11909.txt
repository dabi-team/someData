We report on the influence of the chemical composition on the electronic properties of 

molybdenum oxynitrides thin films grown by reactive sputtering on Si (100) substrates 

at room temperature. The partial pressure of Ar was fixed at 90 %, and the remaining 

10  %  was  adjusted  with  mixtures  N2:O2  (varying  from  pure  N2  to  pure  O2).  The 

crystalline and electronic structures and the electrical transport of the films depend on 
the chemical composition. Thin films grown using oxygen mixtures up 2 % have g -Mo2N 

phase  and  display  superconductivity.  The  superconducting  critical  temperature  Tc 

reduces from ~ 6.8 K to below 3.0 K as the oxygen increases. On the other hand, films 

grown  using  oxygen  mixtures  richer  than  2  %  are  mostly  amorphous.  The  electrical 

transport shows a semiconductor-like behavior with variable-range hopping conduction 

at  low  temperatures.  The  analysis  of  the  optical  properties  reveals  that  the  samples 

have not a defined semiconductor band gap, which can be related to the high structural 

disorder and the excitation of electrons in a wide range of energies.

1. Introduction 

The structural, mechanical and electronic properties of ceramics usually depend on the 

doping level and the type of anions. For oxynitrides, the oxidation state of the cations, 

the  bond  covalence  and  the  band  structure  can  be  tuned  by  mixing  oxygen  and 

nitrogen.  The  wide  range  of  electronic  and  optical  properties  make  them  promising 

candidates for photocatalysis [1,2], electronic [3,4,5] and solar energy applications [6]. 

Depending on the potential application, the study of the physical properties of metallic 

oxynitrides usually is performed in nanoparticles [7] and in thin films [8]. In addition to 

the  doping,  the  properties  of  the  materials  are  also  affected  by  the  microstructure. 

Among  the  chemical  and  physical  methods  for  the  fabrication  of  thin  films,  sputtering 

has the advantage that it is possible to obtain from amorphous to epitaxial structures by 

modifying the substrate temperature.  

From an electronic point of view, it is interesting to study the role of the oxygen doping 

on  the properties  of  superconducting  nitrides.  For materials  such  as  TiN  [9]  and  NbN 

[10],  the  structural  and  electrical  properties  can  be  tuned  adding  oxygen  and  other 

dopant  elements  [ 11 , 12 ].  For  example,  adding  oxygen  a  crossover  from  a  dirty 

superconducting  nitride  (due  to  paramagnetic  oxygen  impurities)  to  a  semiconductor 

oxynitride  can  be  expected  [ 13 ].  Among  the  candidates  to  analyze  the  effect  of 

stoichiometry  on  the  electrical  and  structural  properties  are  molybdenum  oxynitrides, 

The  most  common  molybdenum  oxides  are  the  monoclinic  dioxide  (MoO2)  and  the 

trioxide (MoO3). MoO2 exhibits unusual properties among oxides, shifting from one with 

metallic properties into a semiconductor when the structural disorder increases. [14,15, 

16,17].  MoO3  is  n-type  semiconductor  [18].  On  the  other  hand,  molybdenum  nitrides 

present  several  superconducting  crystalline  phases: 
(cubic)  with  a 
superconducting  critical  temperature  Tc~  5  K  [19],  b -Mo2N  (tetragonal)  with  Tc ~  5  K 
[20]  and  d -MoN  (hexagonal)  with  Tc  ~  12  K  [21,22].  The  chemical  composition  of 

g -Mo2N 

molybdenum nitride thin films grown by reactive sputtering can be adjusted by the gas 
mixture [23]. A distinctive property of g -Mo2N thin films is that its Tc rises from »  5 K to 8 

K  as  the  disorder  at  the  nanoscale  increases  [ 24 , 25 ].  Notwithstanding  the  rich 

properties  displayed  by  the  nitrides  and  oxides,  there  are  only  a  few  studies  on  the 

electrical properties of molybdenum oxynitrides [26,27]. 

In  this  work,  we  analyze  the  influence  of  the  reactive  gas  mixture  on  the  structural, 

chemical and electronic properties of molybdenum oxynitrides thin films grown at room 

temperature by reactive sputtering on Si (100) substrates. The reactive atmosphere is 

 
 
3 

an Ar:N2:O2 mixture. The Ar: (N2+O2) ratio was fixed in 90:10 and the N2:O2 ratio varied 
from 0 to 10.  The results show that the microstructure and electrical properties depend 

on  the  gas  mixture.  Nitrogen-rich  films  are  superconducting  and  the  Tc  is  gradually 

reduced by increasing the oxygen doping. Oxygen-rich  films display a semiconductor-

like behavior. The physical properties of the samples are analyzed by considering the 

influence of the chemical doping and of the structural disorder. 

2. Material and methods 

Molybdenum  oxynitride films  were  deposited  by  DC  reactive magnetron sputtering  on 
Si  (100)  (typical  size  1  cm2).  No  intentional  heating  of  the  substrate  was  used.    The 
base  pressure  in  the  chamber  was  1.3x10-4  Pa.  Films  were  grown  from  a  pure  Mo 

target (diameter 3.3 cm) in a reactive Ar:N2:O2 mixture. The target power was fixed at 

50 W and the total pressure in 0.67 Pa. The substrate was positioned directly over the 
target at »  5.5 cm. Reactive sputtering was performed with 90% Ar and 10 % of a N2:O2 

mixture  (with  O2  total  fraction  0,  1%,  2%,  3.3%,  5%,  6.6%  and  10%).  The  notation 

[MoNxOy]  indicates  thin  films  growth  in  a  N2:O2  gas  mixture  where  x  and  y  are  the 

respective percentages.  

X-ray  (XRD)  diffraction  data  was  obtained  using  a  Panalytical  Empyrean  equipment 

operated  at  40 kV  and  30 mA  with  the  CuKα  radiation.  The  structural  analysis  was 
performed based on Q

 scans with an angular resolution of 0.02°. The film thickness 

-2Q

was  measured  by  low-angle  X-ray  reflectivity  (XRR).  AFM  measurements  were 

performed in a Dimension 3100 ©Brucker microscope. The AFM images presented in 

this work were performed in tapping mode. The chemical stoichiometry of the films was 

analyzed by Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) with a TANDEM (NEC, 1.7 
MV)  accelerator  using  a  2  MeV  4He2+  ion  beam.  Surface  composition  analysis  was 

performed  by  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  using  a  standard  Al/Mg  twin-

anode  X-ray  gun  and  a  hemispherical  electrostatic  electron  energy  analyzer  (high 
vacuum conditions with a base pressure of 10-9Torr).  

The  optical  parameters  of  for  [MoN6.6O3.3], [MoN3.3O6.6],  and  [MoN0O10]  were  deduced 
  and  D )  carried  out  in  the  spectral 
from  spectroscopic  ellipsometry  measurements  (Y

region  of  200–1200  nm  using  a  Woollam  NIR-Vis-UV  ellipsometer  in  three  different 
angles of incidence: 61(cid:176) , 66(cid:176)  and 71(cid:176) . The data was analyzed using the manufacturer’s 

 
 
 
4 

code. The electrical transport measurements were performed using the standard four-

point configuration.  

3. Results and discussion 

The thicknesses of the films were determined from XRR. The modulation in the Q

-2Q

scans is related to the thickness d of the film as: 

(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) = [

(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:13)(cid:14)
(cid:4)(cid:15)

](cid:4) + 2(cid:19)

,       [1] 

where  1-d   is  the  real  part  of  the  index  of  refraction  of  the  film,  and  k  =  0  (intensity 
(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) − (cid:21)(cid:1) − (cid:3)(cid:4) for the 
low angle minima for films grown for 5 minutes using different gas mixtures. Inset Fig. 

minimum) and k = ½ (intensity maximum) [28]. Figure 1a shows 

1a  shows  the  XRR  data  for  [MoN10O0].  Figure  1b  shows  a  summary  of  the  total 

thickness.  The  results  indicate  that  the  growth  rate  using  Ar:  N2  is  16  nm/  min  (see 
Inset Fig.1b). The value rises with a clear crossover at  »  2% O2 as the oxygen in the 
mixture  increases.  Finally,  the  growth  rate  for  »   10%  O2  (no  N2)  is  28  nm/min.  The 

analysis  of  the  surface  topology  indicates  that  is  weakly  affected  by  the  gas  mixture. 

Figure  2  shows  AFM  images  for  the  extremes  [MoN10O0]  and  [MoN0O10].  The  films 

display  very  smooth  surfaces  with  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS)  roughness  smaller  than 

0.5 nm.  

Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns for molybdenum oxynitride films. Nitrogen-rich films 
display  reflections  corresponding  to  the  g -Mo2N  phase  [23].  For  pure  N2  and  low  O2 

concentrations, the films are textured along the (200). The reflections (111) and (200) 

are  observed  in  [MoN8O2].  Gas  mixtures  richer  than  2  %  in  O2  produce  mainly 

amorphous films, which is evident from the absence of peaks in the XRD patterns. The 

change in the microstructure from nanocrystalline Mo2N phase to an amorphous phase 

is  coherent  with  the  increment  in  the  growth  rate  described  earlier.  To  understand 

about  the  influence  of  the  stoichiometry  on  the  structural  changes,  we  study  the 

chemical composition by RBS. Table 1 shows a summary of the results. The error bar 

for the data is 5 %. The extremes [MoN10O0] and [MoN0O10] correspond to Mo2N1.1 and 

MoO2,  respectively.  The  data  show  that  for  gas  mixtures  with  oxygen  above  2%  the 

stoichiometry  of  nitrogen  drops  and the  samples  are mainly  oxides. This  crossover  in 

 
 
 
 
5 

the chemical composition is in agreement with the presence of amorphous structures in 

the XRD data. 

XPS  analysis  was  employed  to  investigate  the  electronic  structure  of  the  pristine  and 
cleaned  films.  The  surface  cleaning  was  performed  with  Ar+  sputtering  (2  kV).  The 
pristine  films  display  a  component  at  binding  energy  (BE)  »   232.7  eV  related  to 

superficial MoO3 that is removed during the sputtering process [29]. Figure 4 shows the 

XPS  spectra  in  the  Mo3d  region  for  cleaned  [MoN10O0],  [MoN8O2],  [MoN5O5]  and 

[MoN0O10]. The results can be divided into nitrides and oxides. The spectra for cleaned 
[MoN10O0],  and  [MoN8O2],  display  the  Mo2N  component  (binding  energy  BE  »   228.5 

eV) shifted to smaller BE by 0.2 eV (see Fig. 4a). The electronic structure for oxygen 
mixtures richer than 2 % displays the MoO2 with BE » 229.3 eV (not shown). After clean 

the  surface,  [MoN5O5]  and  [MoN0O10]  suffer  a  drastic  reduction  showing  MoO  and 

metallic Mo (see Fig.4b) [30,31,32].  

To  understand  in  more  detail  the  electronic  structure  of  the  films,  we  analyzed  its 

valence  band  spectra.  Figure  5  shows  a  summary  of  the  results.  The  comparison 

between  [MoN10O0]  and [MoN8O2]  indicates that for  the same  contribution of  N2s, the 

first  displays  a  higher  O2s  intensity  (see  Fig.  5a).  [MoN8O2]  displays  a  larger 

contribution  of  the  metallic  Mo4d.  The  latter  is  also  observed  at  [MoN5O5]  and 

[MoN0O10]  (see  Fig.  5b).  The  contribution  of  N  drops  as  the  oxygen  increases.  It  is 

important  to  note  that  nitrides  are more  stables  than  oxides  to  the  sputtering  process 

[33]. No nitrogen vacancies are formed during the sputtering process used to clean the 

surface in [MoN10O0]. While oxygen vacancies are formed in [MoN5O5] and [MoN0O10]. 

The  spectrum  for  [MoN8O2]  suggests  that  the  sample  is  affected  by  the  creation  of 

oxygen  and  presumably  nitrogen  vacancies.  This  supposition  explains  the  shift  in the 

shift in the Mo3d spectra and the rise in the Mo4d intensity relative to the O1s and N1s.  

Furthermore, the width of the Mo4d peak and its proximity to the N2p orbital reveals a 

high hybridization (see top panel Fig. 5), while the narrow Mo4d peak and its distancing 

with the O2p orbital indicate lower hybridization (see bottom panel Fig. 5). 

To  correlate  the  microstructure  and  the  electronic  properties,  we  measured  the 

electrical  resistivity  versus  temperature  for  the  different  films  (see  Fig.  6).  The  results 

show that films with reactive mixtures with O2 up 2% display superconductivity. The Tc 
decreases  from  »   6.8  K  for  [MoN10O0]  to  »   3  K  for  [MoN8O2].  Thin  films  grown  using 

oxygen  mixtures  above  3.3  %  display  a  semiconductor-like  behavior.  The  measured 
resistivity at 273 K was found to r 273 K = 100 (20) m

Following,  the  influence  of  the  oxygen  impurities  in  the  superconducting  properties  is 

analyzed  by  measuring  the  upper  critical  field  (Hc2).  The  temperature  dependence  of 

Hc2  for  dirty  superconductors  is  described  by  the  Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg 

(WHH) formula [34]:

  [35]. Figure 7 shows the summary of the results. 

The  inset  in  Fig.  7  shows  typical  curves  of  normalized  resistance  versus  temperature 

for different magnetic fields in [MoN9O1]. The experimental data is well described by the 
WHH model using a

oxygen increases, which suggests modifications in the band structure. 

Now  we  will  analyze  the  semiconductor-like  behavior  for  [MoN5O5],  [MoN3.3O6.6],  and 

[MoN0O10]  in more  detail.  In  general,  the temperature  dependence  of the  resistivity  in

where r 0 is a prefactor, T0 is a characteristic temperature and the exponent p depends 

on  the  shape  of  the  density  of  states  at  the  Fermi  level  (FL)  [37].  For  Mott  variable 

range hopping (VHR) p can be ¼ (3D systems) or 1/3 (2D systems). Moreover, p = ½ 

is  expected  for  2D  systems  in  which  the  Coulomb  interaction  is  important.  Figure  8

lnW versus lnT for [MoN3.3O6.6], the slope p = 0.24 (0.01) confirms the mechanism. The 

T0  values  obtained  from  the  slopes  are  1.4  K,  4.5  K  and  25  K,  for  [MoN5O5], 

[MoN3.3O6.6],  and  [MoN0O10],  respectively.    From  the  values  of  T0  it  is  possible  to 

estimate the hopping energy Eh(T) for a given temperature T [39]:

The  Eh  (5  K)  goes  from  10  m eV  to  160  m eV  when  the  oxygen  is  increased.  These 

values are much smaller than those usually observed for more insulating samples such 

as manganites and ZnO [39,40]. 

The  semiconductor-like  behavior  in  the  samples  was  analyzed  by  ellipsometry 

measurements. Refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) were calculated from 
  and  D ).  Figure  9a  shows  the  results  for 
the  modeling  of  the  elipsometric  variables  (Y

wave  lengths  l

  between  200  nm  and  1200  nm  for  [MoN5O5],  [MoN3.3O6.6]  and 

[MoN0O10].  The  refraction  index  increases  monotonically  as  the  energy  decreases. 
Moreover,  K  (l )  is  different from the dependence  expected for semiconductors  with a 

defined  band  gap.  There  is  not  a  crossover  to  lower  absorption  when  the  energy 

decreases.  For  amorphous  semiconductors,  there  is  not  long  range  atomic  order. 

However, the short-range order remains to some extent, giving rise thereby to a band-

like  structure  of  electron  energy  states  similar  to  that  of  crystalline  semiconductors. 

Nevertheless, the absorption edge becomes indistinguishable due to the high disorder. 

Electrons  in  the  called  diffuse  band  can  contribute  to  the  conduction  even  for  low 

energies. To verify the presence of a gap when the disorder is reduced, [MoN0O10] was 
annealed at 600 (cid:176) C for 1 hour using a vacuum of 1.3x10-4 Pa (sample 1) and 101325 
Pa  O2  (sample  2).  Figure  9b  shows  the  n  (l )  and  the  K  (l )  dependences  after 

annealing. The latter displays a strong decrease in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) 

range  in  agreement  with  the  expectations  for  semiconductors.  In  the  case  of  the 

oxygen-annealed  sample,  we  cannot  estimate  reliable  optical  properties  because  the 

small  absorption  and  thickness  of  the  annealed  material  difficult  the  fitting  of  the 

elipsometric  optical model. In fact, the  obtained n and k values are greatly  influenced 

by  the  optical  properties  of  the  Si  substrate.  For  the  vacuum-annealed  sample, 
however,  we  can  estimate  a  band  gap  using  an  (a hn )2  vs.  (hn )  plot  (with  a
  =  4p k/l ) 

[16,41]. Inset Fig. 9b shows the obtained results for annealed [MoN0O10]. Two different 

band gaps can be identified. The presence of defined gaps indicates that the thermal 

 
 
8 

annealing increases the order and reduces the contribution of the called diffuse band. 

The film annealed in vacuum display energy gap values of 2.15 eV and 2.74 eV. The 

values are in the range of those previously reported for MoO2 and MoO3 [16[41]. The 

presence  of  two  gaps  in  the  samples  may  be  related  to  disorder  and  changes  in 

oxygen  stoichiometry.  Similar  features  have  been  previously  observed  in  thermal 

annealed Mo oxide thin films obtained by electrodeposition [16]. 

4. Conclusions  

In summary,  we  analyzed the  influence  of the  chemical  composition  on  the  electronic 

properties  of  molybdenum  oxynitrides  thin  films  grown  by  reactive  sputtering  on  Si 

(100)  substrates  at  room  temperature.  The  electronic  properties  of  the  films  are 

affected  by  the  composition  of  the  reactive  gas  mixture.  For  rich  N2,  the  films  are 
superconducting.  The  Tc  is  systematically  reduced  from  »   6.8  K  for  Mo-64  at.%  N-36 
at.% to »  3 K for Mo-53 at.%N-30 at.% O-17 at.%. The oxygen is an interstitial impurity 
in the superconducting g -Mo2N phase and is also segregated as amorphous MoO2. For 

rich O2 mixtures, the films  are mainly  amorphous  oxide  and  display  a semiconductor-

like  behavior.  The  electrical  resistivity  depends  on  the  oxygen  content.  The  electrical 

transport  shows  a  semiconductor-like  behavior  with  a  VRH  conduction  at  low 

temperatures. The analysis of the optical properties reveals that the samples have not 

a defined semiconductor band gap, which can be related to the high disorder and the 

excitation  of electrons  in  a  wide  range  of  energies.  The  presence of  a  semiconductor 

gap is evidenced for annealed samples. Further investigations on the influence of the 

thermal  annealing  on  the  electronic  should  contribute  to  understand  the  role  of  the 

disorder on the resulting electronic properties.
