We study the settling of rigid oblates in quiescent ﬂuid using interface-resolved Direct
Numerical Simulations. In particular, an immersed boundary method is used to account
for the dispersed solid phase together with lubrication correction and collision models to
account for short-range particle-particle interactions. We consider semi-dilute suspensions
of oblate particles with aspect ratio AR = 1/3 and solid volume fractions φ = 0.5%−10%.
The solid-to-ﬂuid density ratio R = 1.5 and the Galileo number (i.e. the ratio between
buoyancy and viscous forces) based on the diameter of a sphere with equivalent volume
Ga = 60. With this choice of parameters, an isolated oblate falls vertically with a steady
wake with its broad side perpendicular to the gravity direction. At this Ga, the mean
settling speed of spheres is a decreasing function of the volume φ and is always smaller
than the terminal velocity of the isolated particle, Vt. On the contrary, we show here
that the mean settling speed of oblate particles increases with φ in dilute conditions
and is 33% larger than Vt. At higher concentrations, the mean settling speed decreases
becoming smaller than the terminal velocity Vt between φ = 5% and 10%. The increase of
the mean settling speed is due to the formation of particle clusters that for φ = 0.5%−1%
appear as columnar-like structures. From the pair-distribution function we observe that
it is most probable to ﬁnd particle-pairs almost vertically aligned. However, the pair-
distribution function is non-negligible all around the reference particle indicating that
there is a substantial amount of clustering at radial distances between 2 and 6c (with
c the polar radius of the oblate). Above φ = 5%, the hindrance becomes the dominant
eﬀect, and the mean settling speed decreases below Vt. As the particle concentration
increases, the mean particle orientation changes and the mean pitch angle (the angle
between the particle axis of symmetry and gravity) increases from 23o to 47o.

1. Introduction

There is a wide range of environmental processes and industrial applications that in-
volve suspensions of particles settling under gravity. Among these we recall the pollutant
transport in underground water, soot particle dispersion, ﬂuidized beds and the settling
of micro-organisms such as plankton, rain droplets and snow.
Often, these applications involve a large number of particles settling in quiescent ﬂuids
and despite the large number of studies on the topic, the understanding of this complex

phenomenon is still far from clear. Sedimentation depends indeed on a wide range of
parameters. Particles may diﬀer in density, shape, size and stiﬀness, and real suspensions
are hardly monodispersed. In the present work, we focus on the eﬀects due to particle
shape. In particular, we consider suspensions of buoyant oblate particles of ﬁxed aspect
ratio (AR = 1/3), and show how particle orientation leads to diﬀerent dynamics and
microstructures in comparison to the ideal case of spherical particles.

If we limit our attention to the case of an isolated rigid sphere, it is known that the
settling speed depends on the solid-to-ﬂuid density ratio, R, and the Galileo number Ga,
namely the ratio between buoyancy and viscous forces acting on the particle. Even in
this two-parameter space a variety of particle path regimes are encountered, involving
vertical, oblique, time-periodic oscillating, zig-zagging, helical and chaotic motion as
shown numerically and experimentally by Jenny et al. (2004); Horowitz & Williamson
(2010). The a-priori estimation of the particle terminal falling velocity, Vt is also non-
trivial. With the assumption of Stokes ﬂow in an unbounded quiescent ﬂuid, it is found
that the Stokes terminal velocity Vs is function of the sphere radius, a, the density ratio,
R, the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration g and the kinematic viscosity of the
ﬂuid ν (Guazzelli & Morris 2011). However, when the Reynolds number of the settling
particle (Ret = Vtd/ν) becomes ﬁnite, the fore-aft symmetry of the ﬂuid ﬂow around
the particle is broken leading to the generation of a rear wake. As previously mentioned,
the terminal speed depends on R and more pronouncedly on Ga, but no theoretical
formula that relates these quantities exists. Up to date, only formulae that make use
of empirical relations for the drag coeﬃcient of an isolated sphere, CD, are available
(Schiller & Naumann 1935; Clift et al. 2005; Yin & Koch 2007). However, these formulae
relate only the terminal Reynolds number Ret to the Galileo number Ga, neglecting the
dependence on the density ratio R.

When particle suspensions are considered, the scenario is further complicated by hy-
drodynamic and particle-particle interactions. A most relevant eﬀect occur when a sphere
is entrained in the wake of another particle of comparable size settling at ﬁnite Ret, as
the particle behind will accelerate towards the leading particle. The particles will hence
touch and ﬁnally the rear particle will tumble laterally. This phenomenon is denoted as
drafting-kissing-tumbling of a particle-pair (Fortes et al. 1987); during the draft phase
the rear particle reaches speeds larger than the terminal velocity Vt. The extent of the
increase of the rear particle speed with respect to Vt depends on Ga.

Generally speaking, the mean settling speed of a suspension of particles, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105), is also a
function of the solid volume fraction φ. For very dilute suspensions under the assumption
of Stokes ﬂow, Hasimoto (1959) and later Sangani & Acrivos (1982) obtained expressions
for the drag force exerted by the ﬂuid on three diﬀerent cubic arrays of settling spheres. A
diﬀerent expression was instead found by Batchelor (1972) who used a diﬀerent approach
based on conditional probability arguments. All these formulae relate the mean settling
speed directly to the solid volume fraction φ but are unable to properly predict (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) for
semi-dilute and dense suspensions. For such suspensions, the empirical formula proposed
by Richardson & Zaki (1954) is probably the most used. This was obtained from experi-
mental results in creeping ﬂow conditions and relates the mean settling speed normalized
by the Stokes terminal velocity to the solid volume fraction φ, via a power-law. More
speciﬁcally, the mean settling speed of the suspension (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) is a decreasing function of
φ and is always smaller than Vs. This formula has been shown to be accurate also for
concentrated suspensions and for low Reynolds numbers Ret. A wide number of more
recent studies have been devoted to the improvement of this empirical formula to account
for larger Ret. Among these we recall the experimental studies by Garside & Al-Dibouni
(1977); Di Felice (1999) and the numerical study by Yin & Koch (2007). These authors

showed that the power-law exponent is a non-linear function of the Reynolds number
Ret, and that a correction coeﬃcient should be introduced.

The mean settling speed (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) decreases with φ due to the hindrance eﬀect (Climent
& Maxey 2003; Guazzelli & Morris 2011). In a batch sedimentation system, the ﬁxed
bottom of the container forces the ﬂuid to move in the opposite direction such that the
ﬂux of the particle-ﬂuid mixture remains zero. Hindrance becomes more pronounced as
the volume fraction φ increases, leading a monotonic decrease of (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) with respect to Vt.
At large Ret, however, the suspension behavior is further complicated by the particle-
particle hydrodynamic interactions. In our previous work, we have studied semi-dilute
suspensions (φ = 0.5% − 1%) of spheres with density ratio R = 1.02 and Ga = 145
(Fornari et al. 2016a) and have found that drafting-kissing-tumbling events are indeed
frequent, with the involved particles reaching speeds more than twice the mean (cid:104)Vz(cid:105).
It was estimated that without these intermittent events the mean settling speed, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105),
would be smaller by about 3%.

For suspensions of spheres with φ = 0.5%, R = 1.5 and a larger value Ga = 178,
Uhlmann & Doychev (2014) found that particle clusters form. These clusters settle faster
than Vt and as a result, the mean settling speed (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) increases by 12% with respect to
the terminal speed of an isolated particle, Vt. The formation of clusters is related to the
steady oblique motion observed for isolated spheres with R = 1.5 and Ga = 178. Indeed,
at a lower Ga = 121, for wihch an isolated sphere exhibits a steady vertical motion, no
clustering is observed. An increased mean settling speed at large Ga was also observed
by Zaidi et al. (2014); Fornari et al. (2016b). Recently, these results were also conﬁrmed
experimentally by Huisman et al. (2016) who also observed the formation of a columnar
structure of spheres at high Ga.

In the past few years, numerical investigations were also devoted to the study of the
sedimentation of suspensions of ﬁnite-size spheres in stratiﬁed environments (Doostmo-
hammadi & Ardekani 2015), in homogeneous isotropic (Chouippe & Uhlmann 2015;
Fornari et al. 2016a,b) and shear turbulence (Tanaka & Teramoto 2015). The case of
ﬁnite-size spherical bubbles rising in vertical turbulent channel ﬂow has been considered
by Santarelli & Fr¨ohlich (2015, 2016).

When considering non-spherical particles, the sedimentation process is further compli-
cated as the particle orientation plays a role in the dynamics. Feng et al. (1994) performed
two-dimensional numerical simulations of settling elliptic particles to show that in sta-
ble conditions an elliptic particle always falls with its long axis perpendicular to gravity.
Three-dimensional oblates settling in steady motion at low Ret also display the symmetry
axis in the gravity direction. However, increasing R or Ga the system becomes unstable
and disc-like particles are observed to oscillate horizontally. As explained by Magnaudet
& Mougin (2007); Ern et al. (2012), the path instability of spheroidal particles is closely
related to their wake instability. Indeed, the release of vortices in the wake of a spheroidal
particle is modiﬁed as soon as the angle between the particle symmetry axis and the ve-
locity direction is changed. Therefore, the ensuing wake instability is also strongly related
to the particle aspect ratio AR. A complete parametric study on disc-shaped cylinders
and oblates with diﬀerent aspect and density ratios falling under gravity was performed
by Chrust (2012).

Recently we extended the immersed boundary method (IBM) of Breugem (2012) to
account for ellipsoidal particles (Ardekani et al. 2016). We have shown that above a
threshold Ga, oblate particles perform a zigzagging motion whereas prolate particles
rotate around the vertical axis with their broad side facing the falling direction. The
threshold Ga is shown to decrease as the aspect ratio departs from 1. Particle-pair inter-
actions were also studied. It has been found that the drafting-kissing-tumbling is modiﬁed

with respect to the case of settling spheres. In particular, for two oblate particles with
AR = 1/3 and Ga = 80, the tumbling part is suppressed and the particles fall together
with a mean speed that is substantially larger than Vt. Also, spheroidal particles are
attracted in the wake of a leading particle from larger lateral distances than in the case
of spheres. The absence of the tumbling phase was also found experimentally for pairs of
falling disks with AR = 1/6 by Brosse & Ern (2011).

Much less is known about the sedimentation of suspensions of spheroidal particles. A
pioneering study is that by Fonseca & Herrmann (2005), who studied numerically the
settling of suspensions of oblate ellipsoids with AR (cid:39) 0.27 and R = 4 at the relatively low
Reynolds numbers, Ret = 0.04 and 7. Volume fractions up to φ ∼ 0.2 were considered.
At the smallest Ret, these authors found a local maxima of the mean settling speed (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)
at φ = 0.05, that is however smaller than the settling speed of an isolated oblate, Vt. On
the other hand, at Ret = 7 it was found that (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) (cid:39) 1.1Vt for φ ∼ 1%.

In the present study, we investigate the sedimentation of semi-dilute suspensions of
oblate particles at ﬁnite Reynolds number Ret. In particular, we consider particles with
aspect ratio AR = 1/3, density ratio R = 1.5 and Galileo number (based on the diameter
of a sphere with an equivalent volume) Ga = 60. With this choice of parameters, a single
oblate falls steadily with its broad side perpendicular to gravity and with a terminal
Reynolds number of approximately 40. Four solid volume fractions of φ = 0.5%, 1%, 5%
and 10% are studied. We ﬁnd that diﬀerently from spheres of equal Ga, the mean settling
speed of the suspension, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105), ﬁrst increases with φ, and is therefore larger than the
terminal velocity of a single particle, Vt. The mean settling speed decreases for φ > 0.5%
and becomes smaller than Vt between φ = 5% and 10%. In this range of φ, a power-law
ﬁt similar to that by Richardson & Zaki (1954) is proposed. We then show that the
enhancement of (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt at low φ is related to the formation of a columnar structure of
particles. Within this structure, intense particle clustering is observed. For φ = 0.5%−1%,
the particle pair-distribution function is found to be high in the range r ∈ [2c, 6c] and
between ψ (cid:39) 2o − 80o, with maximum values at r = 2.02c and ψ = 17o − 10o (with
c the polar radius of the oblate and ψ the polar angle with respect to the direction of
gravity). Hence, particles are almost vertically piled-up at low φ as also shown by the
order parameter. At higher φ the amount of clustering is reduced. We also show that
the mean particle orientation (computed as the cosine of the angle between the particle
symmetry axis and gravity) decreases with φ. A power-law ﬁt in terms of φ is also
proposed. The particle mean pitch angle with respect to the horizontal plane increases
with φ, from 22.8o (φ = 0.5%) to 47o (φ = 10%). It should be noted that for an isolated
oblate with Ga = 60 and R = 1.5 the pitch angle is 0o. Finally, we calculate joint
probability functions of settling speeds Vz and orientation |Oz|. By means of conditioned
averages we show that particles settling with larger speeds than the mean, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt, settle
on average with higher pitch angles.

2. Set-up and Methodology

The sedimentation of semi-dilute suspensions of oblate particles is considered in a
computational domain with periodic boundary conditions in the x, y and z directions for
both the ﬂuid and the particles, with gravity acting in the positive z direction. Oblates
with aspect ratio AR = 1/3 are considered. We name b and c the equatorial and polar
radii of the ellipsoid. The computational box has size 20d × 20d × 160d, being d the
diameter of a sphere with the same volume as the ellipsoidal particle. Four solid volume
fractions are investigated, φ = 0.5%, 1%, 5% and 10%. These correspond to 611, 1222,
6111 and 12222 particles. Oblates are initially randomly distributed in the computational

domain with zero angular and translational velocity, and with their orientation vector
[Ox, Oy, Oz] = [0, 0, 1]. Hence, their broad side is perpendicular to gravity and the pitch
angle (deﬁned between their symmetry axis and gravity) is 0o. Note that this angle is
equal to the angle between the plane deﬁned by the equatorial radius b and the (hori-
zontal) xy plane, as shown in ﬁgure 1. Therefore we name it as pitch angle (i.e. when
the pitch angle is larger than zero, the spheroid is inclined with respect to the horizontal
plane). For comparisons, the case of an isolated oblate is also simulated as reference.

We consider non-Brownian rigid oblate particles slightly heavier than the suspending
ﬂuid with density ratio R = 1.5 and Galileo number (based on the diameter d of the
equivalent sphere)

As previously mentioned, this non-dimensional number quantiﬁes the importance of the
gravitational forces acting on the particle with respect to viscous forces. At this Ga
isolated spheres and oblates settle vertically with steady wakes. The Reynolds number
based on the terminal falling speed of a single oblate is found to be Ret = 38.7.

The simulations have been performed using the version of the immersed boundary
method developed by Breugem (2012) and modiﬁed by Ardekani et al. (2016) to account
for ellipsoidal particles. With this approach, the coupling between the ﬂuid and solid
phases is fully modelled. The ﬂow is evolved according to the incompressible Navier-
Stokes equations, whereas the particle motion is governed by the Newton-Euler La-
grangian equations for the particle centroid linear and angular velocities

is the unity vector normal to the particle surface ∂Vp. Dirichlet boundary conditions for
the ﬂuid phase are enforced on the particle surfaces as uf |∂Vp = up + ωp × r.
Using the immersed boundary method, the boundary condition at the moving ﬂuid/solid
interfaces is indirectly imposed by an additional force on the right-hand side of the

Navier-Stokes equations. It is hence possible to discretize the computational domain
with a ﬁxed staggered mesh on which the ﬂuid phase is evolved using a second-order
ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme together with a set of Lagrangian points, uniformly distributed
on the surface of the particle to represent the interface. Time integration is performed by
a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme combined with pressure correction at each sub-step.
When the distance between two particles becomes smaller than twice the mesh size, a
lubrication model is used to correctly reproduce the interaction between the particles. In
particular, the closest points on the surfaces of two ellipsoids are found. From these, the
Gaussian radii of curvature are calculated, and these correspond to the radii of the best
ﬁtting spheres tangent to the given surface points. The lubrication model based on Jeﬀrey
(1982) asymptotic solution for spheres of diﬀerent size is then employed. Additionally,
the soft-sphere model is used to account for normal and tangential collisions between the
ellipsoids (Costa et al. 2015). As for lubrication, collision forces are calculated for the
best ﬁtting spheres at the points of contact and are later transferred to the spheroids
centres. More details and validations for the speciﬁc immersed boundary method used
for ellipsoids can be found in Ardekani et al. (2016). Other validations speciﬁc to the
immersed boundary method for spherical particles are found in Breugem (2012); Lambert
et al. (2013); Picano et al. (2015); Fornari et al. (2016a).
A cubic mesh with approximately eight points per particle polar radius c (∼ 24 points per
equatorial radius b) is used for the results presented, which corresponds to 640×640×5120
grid points in the computational domain and 3220 Lagrangian points on the surface of
each particle. Note ﬁnally that zero total volume ﬂux is imposed in the simulations.

For φ = 0.5% − 1%, simulations were run for 182 particle relaxation times deﬁned
using the equivalent diameter d (τp = Rd2/(18ν)). Deﬁning as reference time the time
it takes for an isolated oblate to fall over a distance equal to its polar radius, c/Vt, the
simulation time corresponds to 2430 c/Vt. For denser cases, the statistically steady-state
condition is reached earlier and simulations were run for 72 τp = 962 c/Vt (φ = 5%)
and 42 τp = 561 c/Vt (φ = 10%). Statistics are collected after 90 τp = 1202 c/Vt for
φ = 0.5% − 1%, 24 τp = 320 c/Vt for φ = 5%, and 6 τp = 80 c/Vt for φ = 10%.

3. Results

3.1. Settling speed and suspension microstructure

The most striking result of our study is that semi-dilute suspensions of oblate particles
with Ga (cid:29) 1, settle on average substantially faster than isolated particles, about 33%
faster at φ = 0.5%. As the Galileo number Ga increases, the eﬀects of particle inertia and
hydrodynamic interactions due to particle wakes become progressively more important
overcoming the hindrance eﬀect described above (Yin & Koch 2007; Guazzelli & Morris
2011). For spherical particles at moderate Ga, the hindrance leads to a power-law decay
of the mean settling speed (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) with the volume fraction φ. Hence, the mean settling
speed Vz is smaller than the terminal falling speed Vt of an isolated sphere for all volume
fractions φ. At low and moderate terminal Reynolds numbers, Ret = Vtd/ν (cid:54) 20, the
hindrance eﬀect is well-described by the modiﬁed Richardson & Zaki empirical formula

and Zaki for settling spheres is also shown (dashed line). In the inset, the mean settling speed
is normalized by the settling speed of an isolated spherical particle of same Galileo number Ga,
based on the equivalent diameter.

while κ is a correction coeﬃcient for ﬁnite Ret that has been found to be in the range
0.8 − 0.92 (Di Felice 1999; Yin & Koch 2007). Note that we have checked that we can get
consistent values of κ with our code. In particular, we have also performed simulations
of suspensions of spheres with Ga ∼ 9 settling under gravity, and found that κ ∼ 0.91.

From the simulation of the isolated settling oblate we ﬁnd that the terminal Reynolds
number is Ret = Vtdeq/ν = 38.7 (being deq the equivalent diameter of a sphere with
the same volume). At these R, Ga and Ret the corresponding wake behind both spheres
and oblates is steady and vertical (Bouchet et al. 2006; Ardekani et al. 2016). For the
case of oblique wakes past isolated spheres, Uhlmann & Doychev (2014) have shown an
increase of the mean settling speed (these authors considered spheres with R = 1.5 and
Ga = 178). The mean settling speed of the suspension (φ = 0.5%) increases above Vt by
about 12%. This increase of (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) is due to the formation of particle clusters.

The results for the mean settling speed of the oblate suspension, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105), normalized by
Vt, are shown in ﬁgure 2. The expected velocity predicted via the empirical ﬁt (3.1)
using κ = 1 and n = 4.17 (obtained from equation 3.2 and Ret = 38.7) is also shown
for comparison. In contrast to what expected for spheres, we ﬁnd that the mean settling
speed (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) is larger than Vt for volume fractions approximatively lower than 7%. For
φ = 0.5% and 1%, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) ∼ 1.3Vt, and for φ = 5% (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) = 1.08Vt. Hence, as φ increases
there is an initial increase of (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt. However, the hindrance eﬀect becomes progressively
stronger above φ = 0.5%, reducing (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt; this observable becomes lower than 1 for the
largest volume fraction considered here. We ﬁtted our data in the range φ ∈ [0.5% − 10%]
using equation (3.1) to ﬁnd (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt = 1.353(1−φ)4.227. Clearly, this relation is valid only
for this range of volume fractions and possibly for larger φ. We leave as future work the
study of more dilute cases to understand how (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt initially increases with φ.

In the inset of ﬁgure 2 we report the same data normalized by the terminal velocity of
an isolated spherical particle with Ga = 60. We see that oblates settle at a substantially
slower rate than spheres for all φ. For φ = 0.5, 1%, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) ∼ 0.36Vt,sphere.

To understand the enhancement of (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt at moderate φ, we ﬁrst show in ﬁgure 3a)
an instantaneous snapshot of the settling suspension at φ = 0.5%. It can be seen that
most particles are located on the right half of the snapshot (i.e. for x (cid:62) 0.5Lx) where
they seem to form a columnar structure. As we will soon show, particles within this
columnar structure fall on average faster than the more isolated particles and than the

displaying a the top view of the same instantaneous conﬁguration. These observations
conﬁrm the importance of particle-particle hydrodynamic interactions at ﬁnite inertia.
Note that the smaller region delimited by a box in ﬁgure 3a) highlights particles that fall
approximately 3 − 3.5 times faster than an isolated particle.

As mentioned above, Ardekani et al. (2016) studied the settling of two isolated oblate
particles at a similar Ga. While two spheres would undergo the so-called drafting-kissing-
tumbling phenomenon (Fortes et al. 1987), Ardekani et al. (2016) showed that the rear
oblate accelerates in the wake of the front particle until it approaches it and almost
perfectly sticks to it. The tumbling stage is therefore suppressed and the particles fall
in contact. The particle-pair falls with a speed that is 1.5 times the terminal velocity
of an isolated oblate. In the same study, it was also found that the maximum radius of
the collision (or entrainment area) for oblates of AR = 1/3 is approximately 4 times
larger than that of spheres of equal Ga for several diﬀerent vertical separations. These
results obtained for particle-pairs are reﬂected in and determine the suspension behavior.
From the close-up in ﬁgure 3c), we note that in a suspension with φ = 0.5% more than
3 particles can pile up during drafting-kissing-tumbling events. These particle clusters
generate strong wakes that, in turn, lead to the formation of the columnar-like structure.
This columnar structure is observed also for larger φ. Note that the (x, y) location of the
structure is purely random. Similar columnar structures were observed also for spherical
particles by Uhlmann & Doychev (2014); Huisman et al. (2016), although for much larger
Ga = 178, while these were not observed for spheres at Ga = 120.

Next, we display in ﬁgure 4a) the probability density function, p.d.f., of the settling
speed Vz/Vt for all φ under investigation. The moments of the p.d.f.s are reported in
table 1. For φ = 0.5% and 1% the distributions are similar and (positively) skewed
towards larger speeds than the mean value. As φ increases, the skeweness of the p.d.f.s
(SVz ) decreases becoming negligible for the denser case, indicating that the dynamics
is mostly governed by excluded volume eﬀects, rather than by pair-interactions and
clustering formation. On the contrary, the standard deviation of the p.d.f.s increases
with φ up to φ = 5%. A slightly smaller σVz is found instead for φ = 10%. The ﬂatness,
FVz , is always around 3. It is interesting to observe that as φ increases, the p.d.f.s
tend progressively towards a normal distribution indicating that the settling dynamics,

initially governed mostly by particle interaction through wakes, becomes progressively
dominated by the hindrance eﬀect.

As can be seen from the p.d.f.s, the probability of having particles rising increases
with φ. This is due to the imposition of the zero total volume ﬂux condition. This
ensures that (cid:104)Wz(cid:105) = (1 − φ)(cid:104)Uz(cid:105) + φ(cid:104)Vz(cid:105) = 0, where Wz and Uz are the bulk and ﬂuid
velocities (Guazzelli & Morris 2011). As said, particle clusters settle substantially faster
than the whole suspension and to satisfy the condition (cid:104)Wz(cid:105) = 0, strong upward local
ﬂuid streams are generated in their surroundings. When these updrafts encounter slowly
settling particles, they drag them in the opposite direction with respect to gravity. Notice
that we have observed this eﬀect also for dense suspensions of spheres with Ga ∼ 9, for
which we found results in agreement with the corrected Richardson-Zaki ﬁt and with Yin
& Koch (2007).

In ﬁgure 4b) we show the p.d.f.s of settling speeds for particles whose centers are
located within x ∈ [0; 0.5)Lx or within x ∈ [0.5; 1]Lx (i.e. the computational domain is
divided in two parts denoted as left and right). Particles located within x ∈ [0.5; 1]Lx
(i.e. where the columnar structure is found, right side) settle with a mean velocity larger
than that of the suspension ((cid:104)Vr,z(cid:105)/Vt = 1.45). A smaller mean settling speed is found
instead in the left half ((cid:104)Vl,z(cid:105)/Vt = 1.1). Concerning the distribution standard deviation,
this is also slightly larger in the right half, xc ∈ [0.5; 1]Lx ( σr = 0.48 and σl = 0.45).
On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the skewness is larger for the slower
particles, located in the region xc ∈ [0; 0.5)Lx (Sl = 0.75 and Sr = 0.44). This is because
on the left half, there are less particles that less frequently undergo intense drafting-
kissing-tumbling interactions. These interactions lead to the large skewness, while the
mean value is similar to Vt being the particles more isolated. Since the drafting-kissing-
tumbling events are more intermittent in the left half, also the ﬂatness is larger than for
the velocities of the particles forming the fast falling column (Fl = 4 versus Fr = 3).

We now turn to the discussion of the microstructure of the whole suspension. To
this aim we calculate the pair-distribution function P (r), the conditional probability of
ﬁnding a particle at r, given one at the origin. Following Kulkarni & Morris (2008), this
is deﬁned as

P (r) = P (r, θ, ψ) =

H(r, θ, ψ)
nts∆V

(3.3)

where θ is the polar angle (measured from the positive x axis), ψ is the azimuthal
angle (measured from the positive z axis), n is the average particle number density, ts
is the total number of sampling points, ∆V = r2∆rsinψ∆ψ∆θ is the volume of the
sampling bin, and H(r, θ, ψ) is the histogram of particle-pairs. More speciﬁcally, the pair
space is discretized in (r, θ, ψ) and at each sampling time we obtain Np(Np − 1)/2 pair
separation vectors r from the simulated particle conﬁgurations. Each vector r is put

into the corresponding bin of size ∆V so that the particle-pair histogram H(r, θ, ψ) is
progressively built.

For our cases, P (r) is axisymmetric about the direction of gravity. Therefore we ﬁrst
report P (r) as function of the center-to-center distance r (normalized by c), and the
azimuthal angle ψ, averaging over θ. The pair-distribution function P (r) is shown in
ﬁgure 5a),b),c),d) for the four volume fractions under investigation. For simplicity, we
denote the axis at ψ = 90o as x/c. The results are substantially diﬀerent from what
observed for spheres at comparable and smaller Ga (Yin & Koch 2007; Uhlmann &
Doychev 2014) for which no evident clustering is observed. For φ = 0.5% we see that the

pair-distribution function P (r) is large all around the reference particle. On average, each
particle is surrounded by other particles, with a higher probability in the region between
θ ∼ 5o and θ ∼ 80o. From this ﬁgure it is also clear that particles preferentially cluster on
top of each other, with their broad sides almost perpendicular to the vertical direction,
and with an inclination that increases with x/c, see also ﬁgure 3c). The maximum of P (r)
is located at r = 2.02c and ψ (cid:39) 17o. Notice that horizontal clusters of sticking particles
falling with their broad sides perfectly parallel to gravity do not occur. Indeed we see
that P (r) = 0 for ψ = 90o, below x (cid:39) 4c. For φ = 1% the results are similar although
P (r) is lower over the entire (r, θ, ψ) space. The probability of ﬁnding a second particle
is again large all around the reference particle, with the highest values between θ ∼ 2o
and θ ∼ 70o. Particles are hence more vertically aligned within clusters, with a maximum
P (r) located at r = 2.02c and ψ (cid:39) 10o (i.e. with the symmetry axis almost parallel to
gravity). The maximum value is just slightly smaller than that found for φ = 0.5%. The
region of high P (r) is found to translate towards ψ = 0o.

For φ = 5% and 10%, P (r) decreases substantially for all values of (r, θ, ψ). The
maximum of P (r) is now found between ψ = 0o and 2o. Note also that for these cases
P (r) ∼ 1 for r (cid:62) 6c, indicating that the random (Poissonian) distribution of particles
(i.e. an uncorrelated statistical particle distribution) is already reached above this radial
distance. Conversely, for the cases with φ = 0.5% and 1% we see that P (r) ∼ 1 only in
a small region between [5; 9]c × [30o; 70o]. The correlation of the particle distribution at
large r/c for low volume fractions is indicative of the presence of the above-mentioned
columnar structures.

A measure of the suspension microstructure that can be more easily quantiﬁed in a
plot is the average of P (r, θ, ψ) over all possible orientations. This is known as the radial
distribution function g(r) and it is shown in ﬁgure 5e) for all volume fractions. We see
that by averaging over all θ and ψ, the maximum of the radial distribution function
appears at a radial distance of approximately 4c. The peak is almost halved as φ is
doubled from 0.5% to 1%. For these cases, the decorrelation of the particle distribution,
g(r) ∼ 1, occurs for r > 20c. This is also approximately the radius of the columnar
structure identiﬁed in ﬁgure 3. The extent of clustering is sharply reduced for φ (cid:62) 5%.
Indeed, the maxima of P (r) are between 2 and 1.5, and the uncorrelated value (i.e. 1) is
quickly reached, r/c ∼ 6.

Finally, we consider in ﬁgure 5f) the order parameter. This is used to quantify the
preferential orientation of particle pairs and it is a function of the radial separation
r (Yin & Koch 2007). This is deﬁned as the angular average of the second Legendre
polynomial

(cid:104)P2(cid:105)(r) =

(cid:82) π
0 P (r, ψ)P2(cosψ)sinψdψ
(cid:82) π
0 P (r, ψ)sinψdψ

(3.4)

where P2(cosψ) = (3cos2ψ − 1)/2. The order parameter (cid:104)P2(cid:105)(r) is 1 for vertically aligned
pairs at a separation r, −1/2 for horizontally aligned pairs and 0 for isotropic conﬁg-
urations. We see that for r ∼ 2c, the order parameter (cid:104)P2(cid:105) is between 0.6 and 0.8 for
all φ. This conﬁrms the observation that when the separation distance r is of the order
of ∼ 2c, most particles are almost perfectly piled up. Above r ∼ 3.5c, (cid:104)P2(cid:105) becomes
negative for φ = 0.5% and 1%, with a minimum value of approximately −(0.2 − 0.15)
around r = 4.5c. Hence, at these radial distance particle pairs tend to be more horizon-
tally aligned, with a ﬁnite inclination or pitch angle between their axis of symmetry and
the direction of gravity plane (as we will show later). For the higher volume fractions,
(cid:104)P2(cid:105) is only slightly negative, conﬁrming the disappearance of strong clustering in these

Clustering and increased settling speed of oblate particles

13

cases. The conﬁguration becomes more isotropic after r = 8c for the more dilute cases,
and after r = 6c for the denser cases.

3.2. Particle dynamics

In the previous section we have analyzed the p.d.f.s of particle settling speeds for all φ.
We now study the horizontal component of the translational velocity (in the direction
perpendicular to gravity), as well as the rotational velocities.

The probability density function of the horizontal component of the particle velocity
in the plane perpendicular to gravity is reported in ﬁgure 6a). For the sake of simplicity,
we deﬁne this component of the velocity as Vx (note that at this stage of the simulation,
most particles are found within the columnar structure and hence, the horizontal velocity
is symmetric around the direction of gravity). The p.d.f.s of Vx/Vt are similar to normal
distributions centered around (cid:104)Vx(cid:105) ∼ 0, with skewness S ∼ 0 and ﬂatness F slighlty
larger than 3, for all φ. On the other hand, the standard deviation σVx increases until
φ = 5%. For the more dilute cases, the fact that both (cid:104)Vx(cid:105) ∼ 0 and S ∼ 0 indicate that
there is a constant inﬂow/outﬂow of particles to/from the columnar structure.
The standard deviation σVx as function of φ is shown in ﬁgure 6b), together with σVz . It
is interesting that both σVx and σVz decrease after φ = 5%. This is probably an excluded
volume eﬀect as at this high φ, particles are more uniformly distributed and settle as a
bulk. Next, we display the ratio σVx /σVz (i.e. the anisotropy of the velocity ﬂuctuations),
see ﬁgure 6c). Considering that for 1 particle σVx /σVz = 0, we see a sharp increase of the
ratio σVx /σVz up to 1%. Above φ = 1%, the dynamics is controlled by excluded volume
and hindrance eﬀects, and the increase of the anisotropy with φ becomes approximately
linear.

Finally, we examine the particle angular velocities around the directions parallel (z)
and perpendicular (x) to gravity, see the p.d.f.s of in ﬁgures 6d) and e). The angular
velocities are normalized by Vt/c. First of all, we observe that both p.d.f.s are centred
around (cid:104)ωx(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104)ωz(cid:105) = 0. Concerning the p.d.f.s of ωz we see that the standard
deviation σωz increases substantially with φ (for φ = 10% σωz is almost 3 times that found
for φ = 0.5%), the skewness S is ∼ 0, while the ﬂatness F is larger than 3 and decreases
from 10 (φ = 0.5%) to 5.8 (φ = 10%). In the x direction, the standard deviation σωx
also increases substantially with φ (σωx (φ = 0.5%) is 42% of σωx (φ = 10%)), S is again
approximately 0 and the ﬂatness F decreases from 16 to 6. The comparison between σωx
and σωz is shown in ﬁgure 6f). Diﬀerently from the translational velocities, we observe
that the ﬂuctuations of angular velocities are larger in the direction perpendicular to
gravity and that these increase more rapidly with the volume fraction φ. We see indeed
in ﬁgure 3 that instantaneously many particles are inclined with respect to horizontal
planes. These particles may be undergoing rotations around axes perpendicular to g,
while settling with an average pitch angle.

An isolate oblate with Ga = 60 falls with its broad side perpendicular to the direction
of gravity. The orientation vector, deﬁned by the direction of the particle symmetry axis,
is hence [Ox, Oy, Oz]T = [0, 0, 1]. This means that the pitch angle between the axis of
symmetry and gravity is 0o. Due to hydrodynamic and particle-particle interactions in
suspensions the mean particle orientation changes. The p.d.f. of |Oz| is shown for all φ
in ﬁgure 7a). We ﬁrst observe that the probability of having particles with |Oz| (cid:39) 0 (i.e.
with the symmetry axis aligned with gravity) increases signiﬁcantly with φ. For φ = 10%
the probability of having |Oz| (cid:39) 0 is 1 order of magnitude larger than for φ = 0.5%. On
the contrary, the mean value of |Oz| decreases with φ. The mean values (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105) are shown
in ﬁgure 7b). For φ = 0.5%, (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105) = 0.922: on average particles are inclined by 22.8o with
respect to the horizontal plane. Increasing the volume fraction we ﬁnd (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105) = 0.895

The increase of the mean pitch angle with φ is an interesting eﬀect and indicates that
particles change their orientational conﬁguration to better sample the available volume.
An instantaneous snapshot of the settling particles for the case with φ = 10% is shown in
ﬁgure 8. We see indeed that particles exhibit all possible orientations between |Oz| = 0

and 1. Note also that some particles clusters can still be observed regardless of the high
volume fraction.

Since the change in |Oz| is an excluded volume eﬀect, we believe that it should be
described by a function that depends directly on the volume fraction φ and on the
remaining parameters, Ga, R and AR, only via some coeﬃcients. Therefore we also report

in ﬁgure 7b) the function

f (φ) = (1 − φ)[φ/(1−φ)]0.535
that is shown to ﬁt our data suﬃciently well. This observation can have implications for
the modelling of settling suspensions.

(3.5)

It must be noted that if a single oblate is constrained to fall with a ﬁnite pitch angle
(Oz < 1), it will reach a terminal velocity larger than that for Oz = 1. We hence decided
to perform an additional simulation of an isolated oblate settling with the mean pitch of
the φ = 0.5% case (Oz = 0.921 or 22.8o) to see how the terminal velocity Vt of an inclined
particle compares to (cid:104)Vz(cid:105). We ﬁnd that Vx/Vt = 0.41 and Vz/Vt = 1.03. The increase
of the falling speed is limited, signiﬁcantly lower than that of the suspension, showing
again the importance of particle-pair interactions. The drift speed is instead large and
about 1.6σVx (φ = 0.5%). We therefore believe that the drift speed of inclined particles
within the suspension plays a role in the formation of the columnar structure.

To conclude this section we report in ﬁgures 9a),b),c),d) the joint probability density
functions J of particle settling speed Vz/Vt and orientation |Oz| for φ = 0.5%, 1%, 5% and
10%. We also show the mean values of Vz/Vt and |Oz| that we found for the suspension,
indicated by dashed lines. The solid blue and red lines in the plots represent the mean
Vz/Vt and |Oz| obtained by conditioned averages of J(Vz/Vt, |Oz|)

(3.6)

(3.7)

For φ = 0.5% and 1%, we ﬁnd that (cid:104)Vz/Vt | |Oz|(cid:105) increases from about 1 at |Oz| = 1
to an almost asymptotic value of 1.5. Hence, particles settling with an inclination (cid:62)
acos−1(cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105)) fall on average with speeds that are 12% larger than (cid:104)Vz(cid:105). In particular,
we ﬁnd (cid:104)Vz/Vt | |Oz| = (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105)(cid:105) = 1.49 and 1.42 for φ = 0.5%, 1% (red circles). Concerning
(cid:104)|Oz| | Vz/Vt(cid:105) we see that it decreases almost linearly with Vz/Vt. Particles with larger
Vz/Vt fall on average with smaller (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105) (i.e. more inclined with respect to the horizontal
plane). The values found at speeds equal to (cid:104)Vz/Vt(cid:105) are 1% larger than (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105) (green
squares).
Similar observations apply also to the remaining cases, those at higher φ. As expected,
for all |Oz|, (cid:104)Vz/Vt | |Oz|(cid:105) decreases with φ. Speciﬁcally, (cid:104)Vz/Vt | |Oz| = (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105)(cid:105) = 1.12
and 0.90 for φ = 5% − 10%, about 4% less than (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt. For (cid:104)|Oz| | Vz/Vt(cid:105) we again
observe values that are 1% larger than (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105).

Summarizing, from the joint p.d.f.s of particle settling speeds and falling orientation,
we ﬁnd that on average particles settling with higher velocities tend to fall with their
axis more inclined with respect to the direction of gravity. Hence, as particles interact
through their wakes, eventually forming clusters, they tend to increase their pitch angle.

3.3. Fluid phase velocity statistics

Finally, we look at the statistics of the ﬂuid-phase velocity. Figures 10(a),(b) report
the instantaneous particle concentration averaged over the settling direction, whereas
ﬁgures 10(c),(d) show the instantaneous vertical component of the ﬂuid velocity, also
averaged along the z- direction. For these statistics we choose a single timestep towards
the end of the simulation (t ∼ 182τp and ∼ 42τp for φ = 1% and 10%). For φ = 1%, we
observe that most particles accumulate around the centre of the computational domain;
see ﬁgure 10(a). Within this columnar structure, particles settle substantially faster than

The dashed lines correspond to the mean Vz/Vt and |Oz|. The red circles correspond to the
mean Vz/Vt conditioned to |Oz| = (cid:104)|Oz|(cid:105) of the suspension. The green squares correspond to
the mean |Oz| conditioned to Vz = (cid:104)Vz(cid:105) of the suspension. The conditioned averaged values for
(cid:104)Vz/Vt | |Oz|(cid:105) and (cid:104)|Oz| | Vz/Vt(cid:105) are showed by the blue and red curves.

Vt, and due to the no-slip boundary condition, the ﬂuid surrounding the particles is
forced to move in the same direction (positive z- direction). Indeed, in ﬁgure 10(c) we
see that the ﬂuid speed Uz is strongly positive in the same regions, with maxima at
the locations of higher concentration. The highest ﬂuid speed in the settling direction
is almost of the order of the terminal velocity (max(Uz) (cid:39) 0.6Vt). Note that due to
the zero volume ﬂux condition, in the locations depleted of particles the ﬂuid moves
in the direction opposite to gravity with non-negligible speeds (min(Uz) (cid:39) −0.4). This
contributes to the hindrance eﬀect. Similar results are found for φ = 0.5%.

In ﬁgures 10(b),(d) we show instead the mean particle concentration and mean ﬂuid
speed for φ = 10%. The volume fraction is relatively high and particles are almost
uniformly distributed in the domain. The locations of high positive ﬂuid speed cannot
be easily related to the positions of high concentration. However, we still observe that
where the particle concentration is lower, the mean ﬂuid speed is large and negative (i.e.,
rising ﬂuid). So, for φ = 10% the maximum positive Uz is reduced ((cid:39) 0.3Vt), while the
rising ﬂuid becomes faster (min(Uz) (cid:39) −0.7) leading to an increased hindrance eﬀect.

Last, we show in ﬁgures 11(a),(b) the standard deviation of the vertical and horizontal
components of the ﬂuid velocity, σUz and σUx , and the velocity ﬂuctuations anisotropy,
σUx /σUz , for all φ. We see that both σUz and σUx increase with φ. However, for σUz an
approximately constant value of 0.25Vt is reached after φ = 5%. The standard deviations

the horizontal direction), for the smaller volume fractions; see the inset of ﬁgure 11(a).
The diﬀerence is progressively reduced as φ increases. For example, for φ = 0.5% we
ﬁnd that σUz = 0.17σVz , while for φ = 10%, σUz = 0.42σVz . This indicates that at high

volume fractions, the dynamics of both phases is governed mostly by excluded volume
eﬀects. Regarding the anisotropy of ﬂuid velocity ﬂuctuations, σUx/σUz , we see from
ﬁgure 11(b) that it also increases with φ. As for the solid phase, the increase with φ is
almost linear.

4. Final remarks

We have studied the sedimentation of suspensions of oblate particles in quiescent ﬂuid
at ﬁnite Ret. We chose the aspect ratio AR = 1/3, density ratio R = 1.5, Galileo number
Ga = 60 (based on the diameter of a sphere with equal volume), and four volume
fractions φ = 0.5%, 1%, 5% and 10%. The single particle case was also simulated and
at this combination of R and Ga, the particle settles with its broad side perpendicular
to the direction of gravity with a straight, steady wake. The orientation vector of the
isolated oblate is hence [Ox, Oy, Oz] = [0, 0, 1] (i.e. the pitch angle with respect to the
plane perpendicular to gravity is 0o).

The average settling speed of a suspension changes with the particle volume fraction as
the results of the competition of two diﬀerent physical mechanisms: i) the hindrance eﬀect,
which is more pronounced in higher volume fractions and tends to reduce the average
settling speed; and ii) the hydrodynamics of particle pair interactions, e.g. drafting-
kissing-tumbling, which tends to increase the average speed and form piles of particles.
We report that, unlike the case of spherical particles of equal Ga, the mean settling speed
of the oblate particles suspension, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt, increases with φ in dilute conditions. For
φ = 0.5% − 1%; the mean settling speed is about 30% larger than the terminal velocity of
an isolated oblate. Note that for suspensions of spheres it has been shown that (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt is
always a decreasing function of φ for Ga ∼ 60 (Richardson & Zaki 1954; Yin & Koch 2007;
Uhlmann & Doychev 2014). The mean settling speed becomes smaller than the terminal
velocity Vt only for φ > 5%. This implies that at lower volume fractions the hindrance
eﬀect is overcome by hydrodynamic and particle-particle interactions and this leads to
an increase of (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt. Indeed, we have shown that in dilute conditions most particles are
arranged at steady-state in a columnar-like structure with a radius of about 20c, where
c is the oblate polar radius. Within this structure, particle clusters settle with velocities
up to 4 times the mean, (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt. Therefore, the probability density functions, p.d.f.s, of
Vz/Vt display a clear positive skewness, SVz ∼ 0.4 (i.e. many particles fall with speeds
larger than the mean value). While (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt is reduced increasing the volume fraction,
the velocity standard deviation σVz increases up to φ ∼ 5%, the skewness SVz tends to
0 and the ﬂatness FVz is always approximately 3. Additionally, within the columnar-like
structure, the ﬂuid is strongly dragged by the particles (due to the no-slip condition) and
in the settling direction it reaches speeds almost of the order of Vt (max(Uz) ∼ 0.6Vt).
To study the suspension microstructure, the pair- and radial distribution functions are
calculated. While no clustering is observed for spheres of same Ga, the pair-distribution
function P (r) is found to be large all around a reference particle and especially between
ψ ∼ 0o − 80o and r/c ∼ 2 − 5. The highest probability of ﬁnding a neighbour particle
is at r/c = 2.02, ψ (cid:39) 17o for φ = 0.5%, r/c = 2.02, ψ (cid:39) 10o for φ = 1%, and around
r/c = 2.02, ψ (cid:39) 0o − 2o for the highest volume fractions investigated. Hence, on average
particles are almost piled up. The extent of clustering sharply decreases for φ > 1%
as it is shown by the pair-distribution function P (r) and its angular average, g(r) (the
radial distribution function). The radial distribution function is found to be maximum
around r/c (cid:39) 4 (i.e. regardless of the orientation, the highest probability of ﬁnding a
particle-pair is located at a separation distance of 4c). In the cases with lowest volume
fractions, the particle distribution is found to be uncorrelated at distances larger than

20

20c, a distance of the order of the radius of the columnar structure. For the denser cases,
the decorrelation of the structure occurs at shorter separations, at distances of the order
of 6c. Using the deﬁnition of order parameter (cid:104)P2(cid:105)(r) we have shown that for distances
of about 2c particles are almost perfectly vertically aligned. Above r/c > 3 particles
are almost horizontally aligned (with a ﬁnite inclination with respect to the horizontal
plane). The suspension structure becomes more isotropic for distances r/c (cid:62) 6 in the
denser cases and r/c (cid:62) 8 in the more dilute cases.

We have also considered the particle lateral velocity as well as the angular velocities.
The mean particle lateral speed (cid:104)Vx(cid:105)/Vt is approximately 0, while its standard deviation
σVx increases with the volume fraction up to φ = 5% and is smaller than σVz . The
anisotropy of the particle velocity ﬂuctuations σVx/σVz increases abruptly until φ = 0.5%
and then approximately linearly with φ. From the p.d.f.s of angular velocities, we ﬁnd
that particles rotate more around the directions perpendicular to gravity. It is found
that particles settle on average inclined with respect to the horizontal plane (the particle
orientation with respect to the axis of symmetry, |Oz|, is less than 1, where 1 corresponds
to a pitch angle of 0o). The mean pitch angle increases with φ from 22.8o to 47o (i.e.
|Oz| decreases with φ). A power-law ﬁt that depends solely on the solid volume fraction
φ and one coeﬃcient is proposed. Computing the terminal speed of an isolated oblate
settling with the mean pitch of the suspension with φ = 0.5% (22.8o) we ﬁnd that the
lateral velocity Vx/Vt = 0.41 and the vertical only Vz/Vt = 1.03, signiﬁcantly lower than
that of the suspension, showing the importance of particle-pair interactions.

Finally, we have calculated the joint probability functions of particle settling speed and
orientation. We used conditioned averages to show that particles settling with speeds
larger than the mean (cid:104)Vz(cid:105)/Vt, have on average lower mean orientations (higher pitch
angles).

With this study we have began to look at the eﬀects of particle shape in sedimenting
suspensions of inertial particles. In the future, it will be interesting to consider oblate
and prolate particles of diﬀerent aspect ratios and Galileo numbers.
